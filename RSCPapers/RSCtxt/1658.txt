    , Accepted 12th December 2013First published on 13th December 2013AbstractIn an attempt to further lower the HOMO of a cost-effective polymer poly(2,3-bis-(3-octyloxyphenyl)quinoxaline-5,8-dyl-alt-thiophene-2,5-diyl) (TQ) by adding F atoms onto the existing quinoxaline acceptor within the polymer backbone, we have synthesized two structurally identical fluorinated analogues of TQ (TQ-F (single F) and TQ-FF (double F)), except for the number of F atoms. The effects of inclusion of F atoms on the optical properties, nature of charge transport, and molecular organization are thoroughly investigated. The resulting two fluorinated polymers show a decrease in both the HOMO and the LUMO energy levels relative to non-fluorinated TQ. Moreover, the fluorination of the polymer backbone has lowered the HOMOs more than the LUMOs, slightly widening the energy bandgaps as the number of F atoms increases. Thus, use of these polymers in bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells, in all cases, leads to large VOC values. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the optimized PSCs based on TQ-F reaches 4.41%. In addition, it is interesting to note that, despite TQ-FF having the PCE that is lower than that of TQ-F, an unprecedentedly high VOC of 1.00 V is achieved, which is nearly equal to the highest VOC values ever reported for polymers.
Introduction
Following the development of bulk-heterojunction (BHJ)-based polymer solar cells (PSCs), in which conjugated polymers are blended with fullerene derivatives (i.e., PCBM), recent years have seen a dramatic improvement in PSC performance, reaching power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 7%.1–9 A significant amount of effort has still been devoted towards the molecular engineering of conjugated backbones to further increase the PCE. Recently, a great deal of research on new materials development has been almost exclusively focused on developing new polymers with low band gap via an intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) donor (D)–acceptor (A) strategy, in order to extend the light absorption for increased sunlight harvesting, truly yielding high short-circuit current density (JSC).8,10–13 However, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) in low band-gap polymers suffers due to their high-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels.12 In addition, low band-gap polymers are commonly accompanied by low-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs), leading to a little deterioration in JSC since the energy difference between the LUMOs of D and A is smaller than 0.3 eV for efficient charge separation.14 Therefore, maximizing the VOC in a low-bandgap polymer is one of the critical factors towards enabling high-efficiency PSCs, which should be achieved via fine-tuning of the band-gap and energy levels of a polymer.
Inspired by the outstanding performance of PSCs based on a cost-effective low band-gap poly(2,3-bis-(3-octyloxyphenyl)quinoxal-ine-5,8-dyl-alt-thiophene-2,5-diyl) (TQ) with low-lying HOMO levels pioneered by Andersson and co-workers,15,16 recently, our group has succeeded in creating an optimal blend nanomorphology within TQ:PC71BM by using processing additives as well as achieving the highest PCE among the quinoxaline-based PCSs reported to date.17 Considering the trouble-free and easy synthesis of TQ, we believed that quantifying the performance of various TQ-based derivatives as well as structure–property correlation regarding its structural modification can shed considerable light on the confidence in the commercialization of PSCs in the near future.
Several groups have recently demonstrated that fluorine (F) atoms substituted directly to the backbone of polymers have shown great promise in enhancing the efficiency of PSCs.2,7,8,18–25 The intriguing “F” impact for the efficiency improvement varies noticeably, depending upon specific systems, which is not yet fully understood. Nonetheless, it is generally true that the electron-withdrawing nature of these F substituents, when substituted directly on the backbone, lowers the HOMO level of polymers, leading to an enhanced VOC in PSCs.5,26,27
In this work, we attempt to further lower the HOMO of TQ by adding F atoms onto the existing quinoxaline acceptor within the backbone, aiming not only to achieve superior VOCvia fine-tuning of the energy levels of TQ with no or only a minor effect on the optical band-gap, but also to further understand the F impact on the frontier orbitals or other properties. In fact, during the course of this work, Hou, Gao, Huang, and co-workers reported TQ-F.28 Herein, we describe the synthesis of two fluorinated TQ polymers, namely TQ-F (single F) and TQ-FF (double F), as shown in Fig. 1 and their properties under photochemical conditions. We have shown that the addition of F atoms is effective in lowering the HOMO of TQ. A TQ-F-based BHJ solar cell reveals a PCE of 4.41% with a large VOC value of 0.95 V. Furthermore, to our delight, TQ-FF is able to achieve a VOC value of up to 1.00 V due to the extremely deep HOMO (−5.81 eV), which is one of the highest VOC values ever reported for polymers.29–31

Results and discussion
Synthesis of monomers and polymers
The synthetic routes to the monomers 5,8-dibromo-6-fluoro-2,3-bis(3-(octyloxy)phenyl)quinoxaline (3a) and 5,8-dibromo-6,7-difluoro-2,3-bis(3-(octyloxy)phenyl)quinoxaline (3b) and the polymers TQ-F and TQ-FF are shown in Scheme 1. First, 4,7-dibromo-5-fluoro-(2,1,3)benzothiadiazole (1a) and 5,6-difluoro-4,7-dibromo-(2,1,3)benzothiadiazole (1b) were synthesized as previously reported,32 and were converted to the corresponding diamine compounds (2a and 2b) by means of the reductive S extrusion reaction with NaBH4. Then, the compounds 3a and 3b were prepared by condensation reaction of the diamines with 1,2-bis(3-(octyloxy)phenyl)ethane-1,2-dione, respectively.33 The co-monomer 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl) thiophene was easily prepared according to the established method.34

With all the monomers ready, the target polymers TQ-F and TQ-FF were synthesized under Stille polycondensation conditions with 1:1 monomer ratio, using Pd2(dba)3 as a catalyst and P(o-tolyl)3 as a ligand. To remove the residual catalyst impurities and the low molecular weight fractions, both polymers were treated with 30% aqueous NH4OH solution and subjected to Soxhlet purification using methanol, acetone, hexane, and finally chloroform. Gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis against PS standard exhibits a number-average molecular mass (Mn) of 54 and 42 kDa with a polydispersity of 2.6 and 3.2 for TQ-F and TQ-FF, respectively, (see Table 1). The synthesis details for monomers, polymers, and purification are mentioned in the Experimental section. Both the polymers are well-soluble in chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB), and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB). The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the polymers shows excellent thermal stability with the decomposition temperature exceeding 440 °C (Fig. S1, ESI†).

Optical and electrochemical properties
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of both polymers in CF solution and in thin film are shown in Fig. 2. The relevant photophysical data are summarized in Table 1. Both display π–π* transitions at around 350 nm and a large ICT feature between 450 and 700 nm which is assigned by analogy with similar polymers.15

The thin-film absorption spectra of both the polymers are red-shifted as compared to their solution spectra, indicating a more pronounced molecular ordering and stronger electronic interaction between the individual polymer chains in the solid state. Obviously, both the fluorinated polymers exhibit not only higher band gaps than their parent non-fluorinated TQ polymer (1.7 eV), but also there is a net blue-shift as more F atoms are added. The optical band gaps (Eoptg) calculated from the onset of thin film absorption spectra are found to be 1.75 eV for TQ-F and 1.83 eV for TQ-FF, respectively.
In order to recognize any differences in electrochemical ionization potentials, neat films of each polymer were deposited onto a platinum electrode and scanned with a potentiostat. The HOMO energy levels of two polymers were approximated from the onset of the oxidation peak in each cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiment and are listed in Table 1. The HOMO levels of TQ-F and TQ-FF were found to be −5.66 and −5.81 eV. As a result, PSCs based on all two copolymers consider the superior VOC achievable (vide infra). It is worth noting that the HOMO levels of both the polymers are below the air oxidation threshold (−5.27 eV), which is necessary to achieve air stability.35 Interestingly, both the polymers exhibit very weak quasi-reversible n-doping/dedoping (reduction/reoxidation) processes in the negative potential range (LUMOs = −3.24 (TQ-F) and −3.33 eV (TQ-FF), estimated from the onset of the reduction signals of each polymer). This observation is in contrast to the non-fluorinated TQ analogue, in which no reduction peaks were detected within the solvent operating window (±2 V) during the anodic sweep, regardless of the scan rate.17
The electrochemical bandgaps (ECVg) of the two polymers, calculated from the difference between HOMO and LUMO values, however, yield larger values than the Eoptg values by ΔE = 0.65–0.67 eV. The difference is caused by the fact that redox potentials are determined by the energy used for electron addition and extraction, for which Coulombic attraction must be accounted, whereas the optical band gap is the energetic difference between the ground and the excited states.7,36 We note that especially the n-doped state in CV can be very sensitive to trace oxygen and water or might react with the electrolyte or solvent. Moreover, to be consistent with our previous report of TQ, we used the LUMO levels derived from HOMO + Eoptgvs. vacuum (see Table 1 and Fig. 2d). The LUMO levels for TQ-F and TQ-FF are −3.91 and −3.98 eV, respectively, which ensure efficient electron-transfer from polymers to acceptor fullerene derivatives (e.g., PCBM = −4.3 eV) for charge separation. With the LUMO levels being slightly decreased, both the fluorinated polymers tend to effectively push down 160–310 meV HOMO levels relative to their TQ analogue, verifying our aforementioned design motif about the effect of F on the somewhat selective fine-tuning of HOMOs without significant changes in photophysical properties.
To gain insights into the optimized molecular geometries as well as molecular orbitals of the calculated HOMO and LUMO isosurfaces of two polymers by using a model trimeric system, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed with the Gaussian 09 package at the B3LYP level using 6-31G* as a basis set. To simplify the calculation, the octyloxy chains in the molecular backbone were replaced by methoxy groups. Similar to those observed for the TQ polymer,17 the molecular orbital distributions reveal that both the HOMOs and LUMOs of two polymers are well-spread over their conjugated backbones, respectively, together with their good coplanarities (Fig. 3). In the computational study, a simultaneous lowering trend of the HOMO and LUMO level energies is observed, depending on the number of F atoms as shown in the bottom of Fig. 3, which is in agreement with the experimental data above. In addition, the replacement of H atoms on the quinoxaline acceptor with F atoms has a strong influence on the magnitude and direction of the molecular dipole moments (see the top of Fig. 3 and the calculated dipole moments with non-, singly-, and doubly-fluorinated repeating units in Fig. S2 in the ESI,† to further quantify this trend). We speculate that these changed features regarding the dipole moments are strong contributors to the significant differences in the morphology of the quinoxaline-based polymers, most likely influencing the optimal BHJ active-layer processing conditions.

Photovoltaic characteristics
BHJ-based PSC devices were fabricated with a device structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/polymer:PC71BM/Al. The active layer of two polymers (TQ-F and TQ-FF) was spin-coated from 2 wt% in o-DCB solution (see the Experimental section for detailed information). The polymer to PC71BM ratios were adjusted from 1:1 to 1:3 (see Table S1 for the ratio dependency of the photovoltaic parameters, ESI†). For the PSCs based on both TQ-F and TQ-FF, the optimized ratios were found to be 1:1.5 (w/w) polymer:PC71BM. The current density–voltage characteristics (J–V) of these devices are shown in Fig. 4 (AM 1.5G condition, 100 mW cm−2) and the device parameters are summarized in Table 2. We obtained a maximum PCE of 4.41% for the TQ-F-based device with a JSC of 9.10 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.95 V, and a FF of 51%. Although the PCEs of all PSCs based on TQ-FF are inferior to those of the PSCs based on TQ-F because of the reduced JSC and FF, it is intriguing to note that TQ-FF achieves a higher VOC of 1.00 V, which is mainly attributed to its lower-lying HOMO level. To the best of our knowledge, this VOC value is nearly equal to the world record for single junction PSCs reported to date.30

Not only does the optimized morphology in the BHJ systems prevent the drop in JSC and FF, but also in our previous work,17 the solvent additives used in the TQ-based PSCs have been proven to play an important role in controlling the optimal morphology and creating a better interpenetrating network, leading to a further improved device performance. Therefore, we repeated the solar cell test for TQ-F and TQ-FF with various solvent additives (1,8-octanedithiol (ODT), 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), diphenylether (DPE) and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN)). In the case of TQ-FF with each of the solvent additives, the VOC values are slightly decreased, however the beneficial effects in both JSC and FF are observed, resulting in the improved PCE of up to 2.71% by adding 2% DIO. In stark contrast, all three photovoltaic parameters of TQ-F-based devices processed with all of the above tested additives become worse, when compared to those of the first test. Despite the similarities in the molecular structure between TQ-F and TQ-FF, the reason for the different photovoltaic behaviors under these processing additive conditions, one must consider the changes in both magnitude and direction of the dipole moments aforementioned, which can affect the subtle blend film morphology. The corresponding incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the optimized devices are shown in Fig. 5. The intensity distributions of IPCE spectra match well with their absorption spectra. The trends in IPCE roughly track those observed in overall PCEs, in which, obviously, the IPCE values of TQ-F under the same conditions are all higher than those of TQ-FF. The JSC values calculated from IPCE data are consistent with J–V characteristics within 5% error limit. The best device based on TQ-F without the additives shows an IPCE of 60% in the range from 350 to 650 nm, which is substantially decreased when processing with the additives. As expected, however, we observe an increase in IPCEs going from the pristine films of TQ-FF to the devices with the additives. In agreement, we already found the same trends as a function of the processing additives in J–V measurements above.

Morphology of BHJ
In seeking to understand the active layer morphology and the effect of the different additives on the device performance of TQ-F and TQ-FF, we investigated the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the active layers, respectively. Fig. 6 and 7 show AFM topographic and phase images of TQ-F:PC71BM and TQ-FF:PC71BM blend films with and without additives.

Both the pristine films are fairly homogenous in size and shape. Moreover, the films are smoother (rms = 0.451 and 0.818 nm for TQ-F:PC71BM and TQ-FF:PC71BM, respectively) and do not exhibit the large domains observed in Fig. 6a and 7a. On the other hand, when applying ODT, DIO, and DPE additives on each film, we notice a change from the original smooth films to the slightly roughened surfaces with the increased domain feature sizes: rms = 2.01, 2.07, and 2.65 nm for TQ-F and 1.84, 1.42, and 1.89 nm for TQ-FF. Quite surprisingly, CN addition causes slight smoothening; rms = 0.433 nm (TQ-F) and 0.471 nm (TQ-FF). These observations show very similar trends to those of the non-fluorinated analogous TQ in our previous work.17 Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was also used to gain an additional structural insight into crystallites of the blend films with and without additives. In all cases, the integrated intensities associated with PCBM scattering are clearly visible, but the presence of the polymeric crystallites cannot be signalled. As a final set of experiments, the charge-transport properties of the blends were evaluated by space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurement to get information about the difference and the results are listed in Table 3.

The detailed fabrication and analysis are described in the Experimental section. In all the cases of TQ-F:PC71BM blends, both the hole (μh) and electron mobilities (μe) are better than the photovoltaic properties of TQ-F and TQ-FF, as shown in Fig. 8 corresponding to those for TQ-FF:PC71BM. These results indicate that the higher JSC values of PSC devices based on TQ-F:PC71BM can be ascribed to their higher charge transport properties. Besides, we attribute the best performance of pure TQ-F:PC71BM, at least partially, to the well-balanced hole and electron mobilities (electron/hole fraction = 7.09). Among TQ-F:PC71BM blends, the charge-carrier mobilities such as higher and more balanced values are observed upon the addition of DPE. Nevertheless, the limited PCE in the devices with DPE additive is still puzzling. Our next research effort is directed toward addressing this plausible explanation.

Conclusions
In summary, two TQ-based fluorinated analogues (TQ-F and TQ-FF) with either single or double F atoms on the quinoxaline acceptor within the polymer backbone are synthesized and characterized. The aim of the design of these polymers is to achieve superior VOCvia fine-tuning of the energy levels as well as to further understand the working mechanism of the intriguing F impact on PSCs. Together with a slight decrease in the LUMOs, significant deepening of HOMOs and a net blue-shift of the fluorinated TQ-F and TQ-FF relative to the unfluorinated polymer TQ are observed and rationalized through a combination of the inductive and mesomeric (electron withdrawing/donating) properties of F. PSCs made from the fluorinated polymers show, in all cases, noticeable higher VOC values and a PCE as high as 4.41% for TQ-F:PC71BM without any processing additives. On the other hand, the PSC device derived from TQ-FF results in an unprecedentedly high VOC of 1.00 V, which, to the best of our knowledge, lies close to the world record for single junction PSCs reported to date. It is interesting to point out that upon adding various additives, the PCEs for TQ-FF are somewhat improved, whereas for TQ-F with all of the additives, the opposite trends are observed. One can conclude that the effect of additives on the PSC devices derived from fluorinated polymers tends to be sensitive with respect to the incorporated numbers of F atoms in the backbone.

Materials
All the chemicals and reagents were bought from Sigma-Aldrich, Alfa Aesar chemical company, Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. and used without any further purification unless otherwise specified. THF was freshly dried over sodium and benzophenone, prior to use.
Instruments for characterization

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian VNRS 600 MHz spectrometer using deuterated chloroform or 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (CDCl3 or C2D2Cl4). The chemical shifts were given in parts per million and coupling constants (J) in Hertz. Elemental analyses of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and sulphur were carried out with a Flesh 2000 elemental analyzer. The molecular weights of the polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with an Agilent 1200 series and mini DAWN TREOS using tetrahydrofuran (THF) as an eluent against the PS standard. The thermal gravimetric analyses were performed using Q200 from thermal analysis (TA) instruments at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a N2 atmosphere. UV-Vis absorption spectra in solution and in thin film were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-Spectrophotometer UV-1800. The electrochemical properties were characterized using a VersaSTAT3 Princeton Applied Research Potentiostat with platinum as the working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode and Ag/Ag+ as the reference electrode. The electrolytic solution employed was 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (n-Bu4NPF6) in dry acetonitrile under an Ar atmosphere. The reference electrode was calibrated using a ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple as the external standard, whose oxidation potential is set at −4.8 eV with respect to the zero vacuum level. The HOMO energy levels were obtained from the equation EHOMO (eV) = −(Eonset(ox) − Eonset(ferrocene) + 4.8) and the LUMO levels were calculated from the equation ELUMO (eV) = −(Eonset(red) − Eonset(ferrocene) + 4.8). The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were collected using a Digital Instruments dimension AFM controlled by a nanoscope scanning probe microscope controller.

General procedure for polymerization and polymer purification
5,8-Dibromo-6-fluoro-2,3-bis(3-(octyloxy)phenyl)quinoxaline or 5,8-dibromo-6,7-difluoro-2,3-bis(3-(octyloxy)phenyl) quinoxaline (0.320 mmol) and 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl) thiophene (0.320 mmol) were taken in a Schlenk tube under an argon atmosphere. 10 mL of anhydrous toluene was added and the mixture was degassed for 20 min followed by addition of Pd2(dba)3 (9 mg, 9.8 μmol) and P(o-tolyl)3 (15 mg, 49 μmol). The mixture was heated at 110 °C for 72 h. After cooling to room temperature, it was poured into vigorously stirred methanol (300 mL) together with 30 mL of 30% aqueous NH4OH solution and the resulting precipitate was filtered and washed with methanol (2 × 200 mL). The polymer was purified by Soxhlet extraction using methanol (12 h), acetone (12 h) and hexane (12 h), and finally extracted with chloroform. The chloroform solution was then concentrated by evaporation and re-precipitated in methanol. The resulting dark colored solid was collected and dried overnight under vacuum. The polymers were characterized by 1H NMR, GPC, and elemental analysis.

Fabrication of photovoltaic cells
The structure of OSCs is glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Al. The ITO-coated glasses were cleaned with detergent and ultra-sonicated in deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol sequentially and dried in an oven for 12 h. The substrates were subjected to UV-ozone treatment for 15 min and then PEDOT:PSS (Al4083) was spin-coated on ITO and then dried at 140 °C to remove moisture. The substrates were transferred to a glove box that is filled with N2 and spin-cast with an active layer in o-dichlorobenzene. 100 nm of Al was evaporated on top of the active layer under high vacuum (<10−6 torr). The area of the Al electrode is 13 mm2. The photovoltaic characteristics were measured in the glove box by using a high quality optical fiber to guide light from the solar simulator. The J–V characteristics of the PSC were measured using a Keithley 2635A source measurement unit under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured by using a QEX7 from PV measurement Inc. The space charge limited-current (SCLC) mobilities were calculated by using the equation , where εr is the dielectric constant of the material, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, L is the distance between the cathode and the anode, which is equivalent to the film thickness, and V is the applied voltage.
