    , Accepted 9th September 2022First published on 15th September 2022AbstractThe defects at a buried SnO2/perovskite interface can influence device performances by inducing bad interface contact, imperfect perovskite crystallinity, and serious nonradiative recombination loss. Herein, a thiourea resin polymer is deposited at a buried interface. As a multifunctional modifier, thiourea resin can enhance the interface connection and regulate the crystallinity of the perovskite by possible chemical interactions and increased nucleation sites. Thiourea resin can reduce the nonradiative recombination loss related to defects by filling the oxygen vacancy defects of SnO2 and passivating the undercoordinated lead defects in the buried perovskite. Significantly, the devices with thiourea resin modification yield a power conversion efficiency of 21.10%, 13.75% higher than that of the device without modification (18.55%). Besides, thiourea resin improves humidity stability by protecting the perovskite from the erosion of moisture due to its water resistance. After aging in air with a relative humidity of 20–30% for 720 h, the unencapsulated device with thiourea resin modification retains 90% of its initial performance. The thiourea resin can suppress lead leakage through the strong interaction between thiourea resin and Pb. This work provides a valid modification strategy for the buried interface.
1. Introduction
The extraordinary photophysical properties of organic and inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have enabled perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to achieve a rapidly increased power conversion efficiency (PCE), even reaching 25.7%.1 Despite the excellent PCE, the commercialization of PSCs is restricted by device stability. The interface properties between the perovskite and the transport layer can affect the device stability by influencing the crystallinity of perovskite films and the dynamic of carrier transfer. For devices with an n–i–p structure, the present studies are mainly focused on the top perovskite/hole transport layer (HTL) interface, rather than the buried perovskite/electron transport layer (ETL) interface due to its non-exposure nature.2 In fact, the defects are always intended to accumulate at the bottom perovskite/ETL interface,3 which hinder the device performances by causing non-radiative recombination losses. Meanwhile, the transfer rate of electrons is slower than that of holes, which led to unbalanced carrier collection efficiency. The defects at the buried interface are one of the main reasons for low electron transfer efficiency. Therefore, developing an appropriate strategy to optimize the buried interface between the perovskite and ETL is critical.
SnO2 is the most commonly employed ETL material due to its high light transmittance, more appropriate energy level and better photostability than TiO2.4 However, SnO2 nanoparticles tend to aggregate due to the van der Waals interactions, which can be hindered by the poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) polymer framework.5 Besides, the defects easily accumulate at the buried SnO2/perovskite interface, which will influence the device performances and stability in different ways.6 For instance, the hydroxyl groups on SnO2 can cause energy loss by influencing the deep energy level trap states in the band gap.5 The oxygen vacancies in SnO2 and uncoordinated Pb2+ defects can act as the charge trap states to accelerate carrier recombination.7,8 Excess PbI2 has been found at the buried interface, which exerts impacts on the surface electronic states of the buried perovskite interface.9 The Pb-I antisite defects are one of the main influencing factors of the valence band edge of the perovskite film.10 Besides, the buried interface defects can attenuate device performances by interfering with the interface connection, the crystallization of perovskite films, and the transmission and recombination dynamics of the carrier.
Majority of efforts have been devoted to optimizing the buried interface, in which the interface modification is the most resultful. The core content of interface modification is the selection of an interface modifier. Zwitterionic compounds,11 fullerene derivatives,12 self-assembled monolayers,13 and small organic molecules14 are the typical modifiers for buried interfaces. Zwitterionic compounds contain the covalently bonded cations and anions, which can enhance charge extraction by forming interfacial dipoles and passivating both positive and negative defects.11 To some extent, the organic moieties used for connecting zwitter-ions will influence the interface electron transfer. The matched energy level between fullerene derivatives and buried interfaces can accelerate electron transfer. However, the fullerene derivatives can be washed away due to their solubility in perovskite solvents, which will reduce the reproducibility in device performances.12 Self-assembled monolayer (SAM) molecules can regulate the work function and surface energy of SnO2 by forming ordered molecular arrays and permanent dipole moments.13 Besides, small organic molecules with tailorable structures can also be used as the interface modifier. The small molecules of Lewis acids and Lewis bases can act as the electron acceptors or donors to passivate the undercoordinated halides or metal defects.14 Sun et al. used biguanide hydrochloride (BGCl) to modify the SnO2/perovskite interface, which improved device performances by enhanced electron extraction and the crystal growth of the perovskite.15
Compared with small molecules, polymers have shown great potential to modify the buried interface because of their dielectric characteristics, water resistance, and continuous structures.16 For example, Tian et al. modified the amino-functionalized polymer (PN4N) interlayer at the SnO2/perovskite interface. The PN4N interlayer can improve the device performances by promoting the formation of high-quality perovskite films, efficiently passivating electronic surface trap states and suppressing photoinduced halide segregation in perovskite films.17 Thiourea is a typical small molecule with a Lewis base, and has been used as an effective additive or interface modifier for enhancing device performances by passivating the defects and improving the crystallization morphology.18 Though small molecules have proven to be effective defect passivating agents, their small molecular structure cannot render perovskite films robust enough against harsh environments because of high volatility. Compared with thiourea, the TSU can provide more Lewis base functional groups per unit area for the coordination reaction, which has been evidenced by the higher adsorption activity for metal ions. Therefore, we prepared the main chain type thiourea resin (TSU) polymer by employing thiourea and formaldehyde. The TSU was utilized to modify the buried SnO2/perovskite interface. The −CS can fill the oxygen vacancy defects of SnO2. The –NH– in a continuous TSU network can provide abundant nucleation sites for the perovskite. Besides, –NH– and −CS can passivate the undercoordinated Pb2+ defects by donating electrons, reducing the defect-related nonradiative recombination further. The strong chemical interaction between TSU and Pb is conducive to decrease the content of lead leakage. In addition, the water resistance of TSU is conducive to safeguarding the perovskite. By modifying the buried interface with TSU, the PCE of devices increased from 18.55% to 21.10%, and the humidity stability of the device was also improved.
2. Result and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the device structure used in this study. The TSU was modified at the interface between the SnO2 ETL and the perovskite. To study the influence of the TSU modifier on the perovskite film, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and the top and cross-sectional surface field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and of the perovskite film were measured. The XRD peaks of the perovskite are located at 14.4°, 24.8°, and 28.6° of 2 theta, which is corresponding to the (110), (211), and (220) crystal planes of the (Cs0.05FA0.54MA0.41)Pb(I0.98Br0.02)3 perovskite (Fig. 1c and Fig. S1, ESI†).19 Compared with the control sample, no new peak appear and no peak shift occurs, which means that the main composition of perovskite does not change after the addition of the TSU modified layer. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the peak intensity at 14.4° and 28.8° enhanced gradually with the increased TSU content, which illustrates that the crystallization of the perovskite becomes better after TSU modification. And the perovskite film with 0.10 mg mL−1 TSU modification obtained the best crystallization intensity. Moreover, the peak at 13.1° corresponds to the (001) diffraction plane of PbI2. The intensity at 13.1° decreased obviously, which can be attributed to the reduced PbI2 content caused by the coordination reaction between PbI2 and TSU. The presented reports have illustrated that excessive PbI2 will accelerate the degradation rate of the perovskite,20 so the reduced PbI2 content will increase the stability of the perovskite. In Fig. 1d and e, compared with the control film, the perovskite film based on the 0.10 mg mL−1 TSU-modified SnO2 ETL shows a slightly increased grain size and reduced pinhole, which reveals that the TSU is conducive to reduce the nonradiative recombination center. Because the S and N in TSU can coordinate with PbI2, which retard the crystallization process of the perovskite by reducing the reaction rate of PbI2 with mixed organic amine.21 As observed in the atomic force microscopy (AFM) results in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the perovskite film deposited on TSU-modified SnO2 exhibits a smoother morphology with a larger average grain size of 455 nm and smaller roughness of 20.00 nm than that of the control perovskite film with an average grain size of 360 nm and roughness of 27.9 nm.

In order to study the interaction between TSU and SnO2, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of SnO2, TSU, and SnO2/TSU was performed. As shown in Fig. 2a, after adding the TSU layer on the SnO2 ETL, the binding energy of Sn 3d3/2 and Sn 3d5/2 shifts from 494.41 eV and 486.11 eV to 494.22 eV and 485.90 eV.22 Besides, the binding energy of lattice O in SnO2 reduced from 530.15 eV to 529.83 eV, and the binding energy of chemisorbed hydroxyl O reduced from 531.78 eV of SnO2 to 530.91 eV of SnO2/TSU (Fig. 2b).23 In contrast, after modifying the TSU on SnO2, the binding energy of N 1s increased from 399.92 eV to 400.32 eV. Besides, the binding energy of S 2p3/2 (161.08 eV) and S 2p1/2 (162.25 eV) increased to 161.28 eV and 162.60 eV, respectively. (Fig. 2c and d).24 At the SnO2/TSU interface, the reduced binding energy of Sn 3d and O 1s, and the increased binding energy of N 1s and S 2p all indicate that the TSU can connect to the SnO2 side by donating electrons.

Compared with the sample of bare PbI2, the binding energy of Pb 4f7/2 for the TSU/PbI2 interface decreases from 138.18 eV to 137.73 eV, and the binding energy of Pb 4f5/2 reduces from 143.04 eV to 142.54 eV (Fig. 3a).25 The increased electron density results in the reduction of binding energy of Pb 4f. As depicted in Fig. 3b, the binding energy of N 1s of the TSU molecule is 399.92 eV, which is defined as protonated −NH2.26 After reacting with PbI2, the binding energy of N 1s increased to 400.25 eV. According to Fig. 3c, the S 2p peak of TSU is divided into S 2p3/2 (161.08 eV) and S 2p1/2 (162.22 eV). For TSU/PbI2, the binding energies of S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 peak increase to 161.59 eV and 162.74 eV, respectively. The increased binding energy of N 1s and S 2p and the reduced binding energy of Pb 4f all indicate that the N and S atoms can donate electrons to the Pb atom. In the formation of the perovskite, the coordination between TSU and Pb can slow down the reaction rate of PbI2 with organic amines to a certain extent. After forming the perovskite, the coordination interactions between TSU and Pb still exist, which can enhance the connection between TSU and the subsequent perovskite. Meanwhile, the coordination roles of TSU and Pb are available to reduce the undesired Pb defects at the interface. The above XPS results manifested that TSU can coordinate both with Sn and Pb, which can make the connection of SnO2/perovskite interface tighter by acting as an important interfacial bonding agent (Fig. 3d). The enhanced interface connection can improve the efficiency of electronic transmission. The FTIR spectra were recorded to study the interaction between TSU and perovskite films indirectly. In Fig. S3a (ESI†), the stretching vibration peak of −CS is located at 716.6 cm−1, which left-shifts to the lower wavenumber of 698.3 cm−1 for TSU/PbI2. In Fig. S3b (ESI†), the peak at 1139.3 cm−1 (–C–N) shifts to a lower wavenumber of 1105.2 cm−1. The left-shifted wavenumber can be attributed to the −CS and –C–N can coordinate with the uncoordinated Pb2+ by forming S–Pb and N–Pb bonds, which will reduce the stretching vibration frequency of –CS and −C–N by weakening the bond strength of –CS and –C–N bonds.27,28 The coordination interactions between the –CS, C–N bonds and Pb2+ are still retained after the formation of the perovskite.

In order to figure out the impact of TSU interface modifier on carrier recombination kinetics, a laser of 532 nm was used to get peculiarity of the steady state photoluminescence (PL) and the time-resolved fluorescence spectra (TRPL). In comparison to the control sample, the perovskite film deposited on the TSU-modified SnO2 ETL gets the reduced PL intensity, and the 0.10 mg mL−1 TSU-modified samples showed the lowest PL intensity (Fig. 4a and Fig. S4, ESI†). The declined PL intensity indicates that the TSU modification is facile to the electron extraction and transport at the SnO2/perovskite interface.29

The result of TRPL also fully demonstrated this view. As shown in Fig. 4b, we fitted the TRPL spectra by the double exponential eqn (1). In which, the τ1 and τ2 represent the attenuation, and the A1 and A2 are delegated the respective amplitude. The average carrier lifetime (τave) can be calculated by eqn (2):30 (1) τave = (A1τ12 + A1τ22)/(A1τ1 + A1τ2)(2)
As revealed in Table 1 and Fig. 4b, the perovskite film based on TSU-modified SnO2 shows a shorter τave (58.83 ns) than the perovskite film based on bare SnO2 (72.29 ns), manifesting that the enhanced interface connection by TSU is conducive to accelerate the interface charge extraction.

In order to explore the impact of TSU modification on the trap state density of the perovskite film, the SCLC curves were measured based on the device structure of ITO/SnO2/TSU/perovskite/PCBM/Ag under dark conditions as shown in Fig. 4c. In the SCLC diagram, two regions deserve attention, one is the low-bias ohmic region and the other is the trap-restricted region. Moreover, the trap-state densities (ntrap) of the samples can be calculated from eqn (3) in the trap-restricted region.31 (3)where εr represents the relative dielectric constant of the perovskite, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, and e is the elementary charge and L is the thickness of the perovskite film. Most importantly, VTFL represents the voltage of the trap filled limit. The value of ntrap reduce from 7.98 × 1015 cm−3 to 6.69 × 1015 cm−3, indicating that the TSU modified SnO2 ETL can improve the quality of the perovskite film. The decreased trap state is beneficial for reducing the non-radiative recombination related to defects.31
To further confirm that the improved interface contact can result in reduced non-radiative recombination, the current–voltage characteristics were measured under gradient light intensity from 40 to 120 mW cm−2. The light intensity (I)-dependent JSC curves are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). After fitting the data, JSC is proportional to the logarithm of light intensity. The slope of the device based on TSU-modified SnO2 (0.27) is higher than that of the device based on bare SnO2 (0.21), indicating that non-radiative recombination can be reduced by TSU modification.32 The light intensity (I)–dependent VOC curve is fitted by eqn (4):33 VOC = nkBTln(I)/q(4)in which, the VOC, T, kB, and q represent the open-circuit voltage, experimental temperature, Boltzmann constant and elemental charge, respectively. The ideal coefficient (n) is a parameters related to non-radiative recombination.33 Compared with the control samples (1.58kBT/q), the device based on TSU-modified SnO2 shows a smaller n value of 1.40kBT/q, demonstrating that TSU modified SnO2 can prevent non-radiative recombination to a certain extent.
To investigate the effect of TSU modification on the interface properties, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) of ITO/SnO2 and ITO/SnO2/TSU were conducted. In the high and low binding energy regions, two edges are taken as the binding energy cutoff (Ecutoff) and the binding energy onset (Eonset), respectively (Fig. S6, ESI†). The energy levels of the valence band (VB) and conductive band (CB) can be calculated by eqn (5) and (6):34 VB = hυ − (Ecutoff − Eonset)(5) CB = VB + Eg(6)
According to the data of UPS, the energy level alignment diagram are listed in Fig. 5a and Table 2. In contrast to the CB of SnO2 (−4.46 eV), the CB of TSU-modified SnO2 (−4.32 eV) is much closer to the CB of the perovskite. The matched energy level with the perovskite can reduce the energy loss of electrons during the transfer from the perovskite layer to SnO2, thus improving the electron transport efficiency. In order to explore the influence of TSU on light transmittance of SnO2, the transmittance of ITO/SnO2 and ITO/SnO2/TSU were measured. As depicted in Fig. 5b, after adding the TSU layer, the transmittance of SnO2 ETL did not decrease obviously, illustrating that TSU modification did not affect light intake. In Fig. 5c, after introducing a TSU layer into the SnO2/perovskite interface, the UV-vis absorption of the perovskite film increased slightly, which can be attributed to the improved morphology and slightly increased thickness by TSU. The dark J–V curves in Fig. 5d showed that TSU modification is conducive to decrease the leakage current, which reveals that TSU can reduce the non-radiative recombination related to defects.

The photovoltaic parameters of the control device and TSU-modified devices are exhibited in Fig. 6a, Fig. S7, S8 (ESI†) and Table 3. The control device showed a PCE of 18.55% in reverse scan (RS) with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 23.62 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.07 V, a fill factor (FF) of 73.42%, and a PCE of 17.29% in the forward scan (FS) with a VOC of 1.05 V, a JSC of 23.58 mA cm−2, and a FF of 69.85%. In contrast with the control device, the 0.10 mg mL−1 TSU-modified devices displayed much better reverse scanned photovoltaic performances with a JSC of 24.88 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.11 V, a FF of 76.43% and a PCE of 21.10%, and forward scanned photovoltaic performances with a JSC of 24.81 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.10 V, a FF of 74.51% and a PCE of 20.33%. And the 0.10 mg mL−1 TSU-modified devices exhibited a reduced hysteresis effect compared to the control device, which can be proved by the decreased hysteresis index from 0.068 (control device) to 0.036 (TSU modified device). After adding the TSU layer, the improvement of JSC is due to the improved electronic transmission efficiency. And increased VOC is attributed to the more matched energy level alignment and reduced defects related non-radiative recombination.35 The external quantum efficiency is measured with light in the wavelength range from 300 nm to 900 nm. As shown in Fig. 6b, the 0.10 mg mL−1 TSU-modified device yields the highest external quantum efficiencies and an integrated JSC of 23.86 mA cm−1, obviously higher than that of the control device (22.71 mA cm−1). The development law of integrated JSC is in accordance with the JSC from the J–V test. In order to further confirm the general effect of the TSU modifier layer on improving device performance, we prepared 25 devices with or without TSU modification and measured their PCE, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6c, compared to the average PCE of control devices (17.54%), the devices based on TSU-modified SnO2 achieved an improved average PCE of 20.77%. The increased photovoltaic parameters and EQE all indicate that the TSU can enhance the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the devices.

To investigate the influence of TSU on device stability, the performances of the devices without and with TSU modification were tracked in Fig. 6d. After aging in air with 20–30% RH for 500 h, the control device retains 64.72% of its initial PCE value, while the TSU-modified devices retained 96.03% of their initial PCE. Water molecules will invade the perovskite film from each exposed surface and then affect the stability of the perovskite film and devices. The exposed edge of the ETL/perovskite layer cross section is also one of the invasion sites of water molecules. The TSU powder is pressed into sheets for testing contact angles. As shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), the contact angle of the TSU sheet is 79.19°, which shows hydrophobicity of TSU. Therefore, modifying the hydrophobic TSU on the buried interface can improve the humidity stability of the device to a certain extent. Fig. S10 (ESI†) displays the stability of the device without and with TSU modification under full solar illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) of continuous MPP tracking under an argon atmosphere. After 120 h, the TSU-modified device retains 90% of its original PCE value, outperforming that without TSU modification (62%). This manifests that TSU modification can improve the photostability of the device. Besides, the enhanced interface connection, reduced defects, and improved morphology of the perovskite film by TSU are the main reasons for improved stability, because the defects are the starting point for moisture and oxygen intrusion into perovskite films.
Perovskite solar cells have been blamed for lead leaks, which will pollute the environment and affect the industrialization of devices.36 Encouraged by the strong interaction between TSU and Pb, we evaluate the lead leakage of the perovskite film based on SnO2 and TSU-treated SnO2 substrates. In Fig. 7, the lead concentrations in the leaching liquor of the perovskite films were tested by using the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) measurements. Compared with the higher lead concentration (6.032 mg L−1) of the control films, the lead concentration in the leaching liquor of the TSU-modified perovskite film was 1.198 mg L−1. The significantly reduced lead concentration suggests that TSU can inhibit lead leakage. As shown in Fig. 3, TSU can form strong chemical interactions with Pb because TSU is a typical Lewis base containing multiple coordination atoms. Therefore, the reduced lead leaks can be attributed to the strong interaction between TSU and Pb.

3. Conclusions
In a nutshell, this work demonstrates a facile and effective method to improve the buried SnO2/perovskite interface by TSU modification. The TSU can act as an interface chemical bridge to realize the bilateral connection of SnO2 and perovskite by chemical interactions. TSU can fill the oxygen vacancy defects of SnO2 and passivate Pb2+ defects by donating the electrons of S and N. And the TSU can regulate the energy level matching of SnO2 and the perovskite. Based on the enhanced interface connection, passivated interface defects, and matched interface energy level, the TSU is conducive to improve the interfacial charge extraction and PCE. The hydrophobic nature of the TSU can reduce the negative effect of humidity on the perovskite film, resulting in the improved humidity stability. This work paves promising ways for further improvement of the buried interface for highly efficient and stable PSCs.

The organic amine halide salt was obtained from Greatcell Solar Materials Pty Ltd, like CH3NH3I (MAI), CH3NH3Cl (MACl), HC(NH2)2I (FAI), and CH3NH3Br (MABr); thiourea, formaldehyde and acetonitrile were from Aladdin Chemistry Co. Ltd. Bis-trifluoromethane sulfuonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI), anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), isopropanol (IPA) and chlorobenzene (CB) were obtained from Sigma Aldrich, Corp. Ltd.
Preparation of TSU
For the preparation of TSU, 0.2 mol thiourea was dissolved in 40 ml distilled water, and 15 ml formaldehyde solution (37%) was dropped into above solution slowly with magnetic stirring. After adjusting the pH to 8.5–9.0 by NaOH, the mixed solution was heated to 90–95 °C for 6 h to complete the reaction. Then the thiourea resin was washed with mixed water/ethanol collected for vacuum drying.
Device fabrication
The laser etched ITO glass substrates were cleaned with an abluent, deionized water and ethanol orderly for 30 minutes with an ultrasonic cleaner. And the substrate is dried with high pressure nitrogen. Then the ITO glass substrates were treated for 45 minutes in the UV-ozone surface treatment apparatus. The devices were prepared by performing the following steps on the above substrate. For a start, the SnO2 colloidal solution (the volume ratio of the SnO2 colloid dispersion:ultrapure water = 1:5) was spin-coated on ITO glass substrates at 3000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 150 °C for 30 min. The cooled SnO2 film was treated for 45 minutes in the UV-ozone surface treatment apparatus. Next, TSU was dissolved in the mixed solution of DMF and DMSO (VDMF/VDMSO = 9:1) to obtain the TSU solution with a series of concentrations of 0.00 mg mL−1, 0.05 mg mL−1, 0.10 mg mL−1 and 0.15 mg mL−1. Then the TSU solution with different concentrations were spin-coated on the SnO2 film at 3000 rpm for 30 s and calcined at 120 °C for 10 min in an argon-filled glove box for enhancing the connection between TSU and substrates. Once again, the perovskite layer was prepared by the two-step solution method. Firstly, the PbI2 precursor solution (1.3 M PbI2 and 3 wt% CsI in VDMF/VDMSO= 9:1) was deposited on the above substrates by the spin-coating method (2500 rpm, 30 s) and treated at 70 °C for 1 min. Secondly, the mixed organic amine solution (0.12 M MAI, 0.05 M MABr, 0.03 M MACl, and 0.23 M FAI dissolved in IPA) was spin-coated on the PbI2 film (2300 rpm, 30 s). After spin-coating the organic amine solution, the samples were placed in air and annealed at 150 °C for 15 min in order to form a mixed perovskite layer. Finally, the spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by adding 75.00 mg spiro-OMeTAD, 35 μL Li-TFSI solution (260 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile), and 30 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine in chlorobenzene. The spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin-coated on the perovskite layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Ag was evaporated onto the spiro-OMeTAD layer as a back electrode by the vacuum thermal evaporation method. In this manuscript, SnO2 represents the control sample, while the SnO2/TSU is the 0.10 mg mL−1 TSU-modified samples. In the ESI,† the perovskite film based on the modified SnO2 ETL with different concentrations of TSU (0.00 mg mL−1, 0.05 mg mL−1, 0.10 mg mL−1 and 0.15 mg mL−1) can be defined as a, b, c, and d, respectively.
Characterizations
In order to determine the composition of the perovskite, X-ray power diffraction (XRD) was tested using a BRUKER D8-ADVANCE with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 1.5418 Å) and a working voltage of 40 kV and a working current of 40 mA, respectively. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was utilized to observe the top and cross-sectional characteristics by JEOL-JSM-6701F with the working voltage and current of 10 kV and 10 μA, respectively. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was conducted with a Bruker Dimension Icon AFM to analyse the grain size and roughness of the perovskite film. The electrostatic potential (ESP) maps were calculated using Gaussian 9.0 program at the B3LYP/6-31G level of density functional theory (DFT). To study the interaction of TSU with SnO2 and PbI2, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was recorded on a Thermo Scientific with an Al Kα excitation source at 1486.6 eV under a working voltage of 12 kV and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was tested on a Nicolet Is50R FT-IR. Because of the non-exposed feature of buried interfaces, the TSU solution was spin-coated on the surface of the as-prepared PbI2 film to study the interaction between TSU and Pb. In order to figure out the change in energy levels of SnO2 after TSU modification, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was performed on a Thermo ESCALAB XI+ with a monochromatic He I light source at 21.22 eV and a VG Scienta analyzer. To obtain the secondary electron cutoff of the film, a bias voltage (−5 eV) was applied. The steady state photoluminescence (PL) curves and the time-resolved fluorescence spectra (TRPL) were characterized to analyze carrier transportation efficiency. The PL was recorded on a iHR 550 HORIBA with a 532 nm laser. The TRPL was tested using a home-built scanning confocal system based on an inverted microscope (Nikon, TE2000-U) at the State Key Laboratory of Quantum Optics and Quantum Optics Devices of Shanxi University. The space charge limited current (SCLC) curve and the dark density versus voltage (J–V) curves were recorded on a CHI660E workstation. SCLC was recorded with the scan rate of 0.1 V s−1 and from 0 to 1 V by the linear cyclic voltammetry method. The dark J–V curve was verified by the linear cyclic voltammetry method (the scan rate: 0.05 V s−1 and the range: −1 to 1 V) in the dark environment. In order to investigate the dependence curve of JSC and VOC on light intensity, the J–V curves under different light intensities (standardized by the standard Si photovoltaic cell) were tested using CEL-AAAS50 assembled with a Keithley 2400 source meter. And the J–V curves under AM 1.5G one sun (100 mW cm−2) were also measured by the same method. And the mask was used to control the active area with 0.09 cm2. The external quantum efficiencies (EQE) was explored using the solar cell quantum efficiency measurement system (QE-R, EnliTechnology Co., Ltd). The maximum power point tracking (MPP) stability test was performed under 1-sun illumination (100 mW cm−2) in an argon atmosphere. The contact angle was tested using a contact angle/surface tension measuring instrument (JY-82B Kruss DSA). To demonstrate the influence of TSU on the lead leakage content, the perovskite film was soaked in water for 10 minutes and tested for lead content using an Agilent 5110.
