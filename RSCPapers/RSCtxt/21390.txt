    , Accepted 3rd March 2009First published on 30th March 2009AbstractThree novel organic dyes based on porphyrin derivatives were designed and synthesized for dye-sensitized solar cells, resulting in a maximum power conversion efficiency (η) of 5.14% and a maximum IPCE value of 72% for a cell based on the PZnZn-hTdye.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been extensively investigated for their capability to convert solar light directly into electricity at low cost and high efficiency since the report of Grätzel and co-workers in 1991.1 To date, the most efficient dyes are Ru-polypyridyl complexes with efficiencies of 9–11%.2 In recent years, the interest in organic dyes as substitutes of noble metal complexes has increased in terms of economic dye production as well as for feasible control of the factors which influence the efficiency of cells.3 Among the organic dyes, porphyrins and their derivatives have been regarded as potential photosensitizers in DSSCs because they possess an intense Soret band at 400–450 nm and moderate Q bands at 500–650 nm. Moreover, they contain a conveniently modifiable macrocyclic structure and ultrafast electron injection properties together with slow charge recombination kinetics comparable to those of Ru dyes.4 However, porphyrin dyes showed low efficiency compared with Ru dyes for DSSCs due to a poor match with the solar light distribution. To improve the performance of porphyrin dyes, porphyrins with extended π-conjugation and efficient anchoring groups have been designed and this led to better photovoltaic performance.5 To the best of our knowledge, there are few reports on meso-substituted porphyrin dyes containing thiophene derivatives and cyanoacrylic acid moieties for application in DSSCs.
Here, we designed and synthesized three new porphyrin dyes with D–π–A structure: the porphyrin acts as a donor and cyanoacrylic acid acts as an acceptor/anchoring group, linked by thiophene derivatives to broaden the absorption of the dyes (see Fig. 1). Three methylphenyl groups are introduced to reduce aggregation between neighboring porphyrins on the TiO2 surface by sterically hindering the porphyrin core. We systematically studied the effects of increasing thiophene number and adding hexyl side chains on the photoelectrochemical and photovoltaic performances of the dyes.
 Fig. 1  Structures of the three porphyrin dyes. 
The synthetic procedures towards 2-cyano-3-(5-(4-(2-thienyl)phenyl)-10,15,20-trismethylphenylporphyrinatozinc(II)yl)acrylic acid (PZnZn-T) and 2-cyano-3-(5-(4-(3-hexyl-2-thienyl)phenyl)-10,15,20-trismethylphenylporphyrinatozinc(II)yl)acrylic acid (PZnZn-hT) included a Stille coupling reaction,6a,b Vilsmeier formylation reaction6c and Knoevenagel reaction.6d The starting material 5-(4-bromophenyl)-10,15,20-tris(4-methylphenyl)porphyrinatozinc (PZnZn) was synthesized by the condensation of p-tolualdehyde with 4-bromobenzaldehyde and pyrrole, and then treated with Zn(OAc)2 for 4 h. PZnZn-T and PZnZn-hT were prepared by Stille coupling with PZnZn and tributylstannyl-thiophene derivatives, followed by Vilsmeier formylation with POCl3 and DMF in 1,2-dichloroethane, and finally Knoevenagel reaction with cyanoacetic acid. PZnZn-oT was prepared by Stille coupling with PZnZn and tributylstannyl-oligothiophene, subsequently reacted with 5-bromothiophene-2-carbaldehyde, and finally condensation with cyanoacetic acid. The number of the repeated thiophene units (n) in PZnZn-oT was determined to be 4 by 1H NMR and elemental analysis. The structures of the three dyes were verified by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, FT-IR, elemental analysis and MALDI-TOF mass spectra (see ESI†).
The UV-visible absorption spectra of the three porphyrin dyes and PZnZn (as reference) were measured in CHCl3 and on TiO2 films. As shown in Fig. 2, the absorption bands of PZnZn-T (λmax = 422 nm, ε = 2.55 × 105; 550 nm, ε = 0.18 × 105), PZnZn-hT (λmax = 422 nm, ε = 2.64 × 105; 550 nm, ε = 0.16 × 105), PZnZn-oT (λmax = 422 nm, ε = 1.2 × 105; 546 nm, ε = 0.13 × 105) in CHCl3 are both broadened and slightly red-shifted compared with those of PZnZn (λmax = 420 nm, ε = 2.21 × 105; 547 nm, ε = 0.07 × 105) due to the incorporation of thiophene units. In particular, the absorption intensity at 450–530 nm is greatly enhanced for the meso-substituted oligothiophene, PZnZn-oT. The absorption bands of the porphyrin dyes on TiO2 films exhibit a larger redshift and broadening due to the interaction of the anchoring groups with the surface of TiO2 in comparison with the corresponding spectra in CHCl3. The emission spectra of the porphyrin dyes were measured in CHCl3 by exciting at the peaks of the Soret bands. The emission peaks of PZnZn-T (603 nm, 653 nm) and PZnZn-hT (603 nm, 646 nm) are red-shifted by 5–8 nm relative to those of PZnZn (598 nm, 645 nm), which is consistent with the results of the UV-visible absorption spectra. As for PZnZn-oT, a new emission peak at 568 nm was observed, which is ascribed to the incorporation of the oligothiophene unit. No emission spectra were observed for the porphyrin dyes on TiO2 films as a result of electron injection from the excited singlet state of the dyes into the conduction band of the TiO2. The zero–zero energies (E0−0) are estimated from the intersection of the normalized UV-visible absorption spectra and emission spectra. The E0−0 energies of the three porphyrin dyes are smaller than the value of PZnZn (see Table S1, ESI†).

Cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry were used to determine the redox potentials of the porphyrin dyes. The three dyes showed quasi-reversible waves for one-electron oxidation and reduction. The oxidation potential and the reduction potential correspond to the HOMO and LUMO energies, respectively. The oxidation potentials of PZnZn-T (1.26 V vs.NHE), PZnZn-hT (1.27 V vs.NHE) and PZnZn-oT (1.29 V vs.NHE) are positively shifted by 30, 40 and 60 mV compared to PZnZn (1.23 V vs.NHE), respectively. PZnZn-T (−1.138 V vs.NHE) and PZnZn-hT (−1.128 V vs.NHE) both show one reduction peak, which are more negative than that of PZnZn-oT (−1.08 V vs.NHE). The electrochemical HOMO–LUMO gaps were calculated to be 2.37 eV for PZnZn-oT and 2.398 eV for both PZnZn-T and PZnZn-hT, which are smaller than PZnZn. From spectroscopic and electrochemical measurements, the driving forces for charge injection from the excited porphyrin singlet state to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs.NHE) (ΔGinj) and the regeneration of porphyrin radical cation by the I−/I3− couple (0.5 V vs.NHE)7 (ΔGreg) for the porphyrin-sensitized TiO2cells were determined (see Table S2, ESI†). Both of the processes are thermodynamically feasible.
The TiO2-coated FTO (SnO2:F glass) films were prepared from a suspension of P25 and 1 wt% magnesium acetate solution following a literature procedure.8 The films were sintered at 450 °C for 30 min and treated with 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min and finally annealed again at 450 °C for 30 min. The TiO2electrodes were immersed into DMF containing 1 mM porphyrin dyes for 15 min to give porphyrin modified electrodes. The electrolyte is LiI (0.05 M)–I2 (0.5 M)–4-tert-butylpyridine (0.5 M) in 3-methoxypropionitrile. The dye-sensitized cells based on the three porphyrin dyes and N719 dye were measured under simulated AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2). Interestingly, we noticed that the η values of the porphyrin dyes increased with increasing illuminating time during the tests of photovoltaic performance. Taking PZnZn-hT as an example (see Table S3, ESI†), the η value increased dramatically in the first 10 min, and then increased slightly and became constant after 100 min. At present, the reason of this phenomenon is unclear, but it may be associated with the macrocyclic structure of the porphyrin dye.
In this study, we investigated the effect of different solvents on the photovoltaic performance of the cell based on PZnZn-hT. DMF, C2H5OH, CH3CN, CHCl3 were employed to dissolve the dye. Fig. 3 shows that there are distinct differences in the performance of cells based on PZnZn-hT when fabricated in different dye baths, with a prominent η value of 5.14% in DMF, 4.80% in C2H5OH and 4.37% in CH3CN, but sharply decreasing in CHCl3. This phenomena indicated that a better η value results from a synergy of the polarity of the solvent, the solubility of dye, and the binding modes of dye to TiO2 surface in different solvents.9

Fig. 4 shows the current–voltage characteristics of the three porphyrin dyes in DMF. The dyes display similar Voc and ff values, and the trend of η values matches the order of Jsc. PZnZn-hT exhibits a maximum power conversion efficiency of 5.14%, which is higher than PZnZn-T (4.25%) and PZnZn-oT (4.55%). For comparison, a η value of 7.99% was measured under the same conditions for DSSCs based on the N719 dye. The different η values primarily result from the different values of Jsc, which may reflect differences in the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) values for the porphyrin-sensitized cells. Fig. 5 depicts IPCEs for DSSCs based on the three dyes, which closely match the corresponding absorption spectra. Of the three dyes, PZnZn-hT has the maximal IPCE value of 72% at 430 nm. Considering the similar absorption features and driving forces of PZnZn-T and PZnZn-hT, we exclude the influence of light harvesting efficiency and electron injection efficiency in the η values. Therefore, efficient electron collection of PZnZn-hT may be responsible for the higher η value. A long alkyl chain on the thiophene ring can suppress dye aggregation on the TiO2 surface and reduce charge recombination by preventing the approach of acceptors (i.e., I3− ions) to the TiO2,6c,e leading to the higher electron collection efficiency of PZnZn-hT. Compared with PZnZn-T, the higher performance of PZnZn-oT is mainly ascribed to the higher light harvesting capability in the range of 460–540 nm. The lower η value of PZnZn-oT compared with PZnZn-hT is mainly due to low electron transport efficiency, which results from the long distance between donor and acceptor.10

In conclusion, we have successfully synthesized three novel thiophene-linked porphyrin dyes with D–π–A structure and applied them in dye-sensitized solar cells. Among the three porphyrin dyes, PZnZn-hT exhibits the maximum power conversion efficiency of 5.14%, which is 64% of the value for N719 under similar conditions. The results clearly show that the thiophene π-conjugation unit can improve the light harvesting capability of porphyrin dyes, and the length as well as the alkyl chain of this unit can influence the electron transport efficiency, both of which are crucial for photovoltaic performance of DSSCs. To further improve the performance of solar cells based on these porphyrin dyes, further structure modification of the meso-substituted porphyrin will be investigated in our laboratory.
