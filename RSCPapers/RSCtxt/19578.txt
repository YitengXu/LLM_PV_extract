    , Accepted 27th September 2010First published on 6th January 2011AbstractThe exciton-dissociation and charge-recombination processes in donor–acceptor complexes found in α-sexithienyl/C60 and α-sexithienyl/perylenetetracarboxydiimide (PDI) solar cells are investigated by means of quantum-chemical methods. The electronic couplings and exciton-dissociation and charge-recombination rates have been evaluated for various configurations of the complexes. The results suggest that the decay of the lowest charge-transfer state to the ground state in the PDI-based devices: (i) is faster than that in the fullerene-based devices and (ii) in most cases, can compete with the dissociation of the charge-transfer state into mobile charge carriers. This faster charge-recombination process is consistent with the lower performance observed experimentally for the devices using PDI derivatives as the acceptor.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells are currently attracting intense interest due to a number of potential advantages, such as low cost, flexibility, large-area capability, and ease of processing.1–10 The architecture of an organic solar cell typically consists of an organic bilayer or of a blend (bulk heterojunction), composed of an electron donor (D) and an electron acceptor (A) material, sandwiched between two electrodes of different nature.11,12 The mechanism of light-to-electricity conversion includes five main steps: (i) light absorption: the donor and/or acceptor materials absorb sunlight to generate excitons (electrically neutral, bound electron-hole pairs); the strength and width of the absorption spectrum need to be maximized for efficiently harvesting the incident solar radiation; (ii) exciton diffusion: excitons have to migrate to the D/A interface; a large exciton diffusion length is desirable to ensure that the exciton can reach the interface before it decays; (iii) exciton dissociation: excitons dissociate at the interface with electrons going into the acceptor and holes into the donor; the charge-transfer rate needs to be maximized while charge recombination must be suppressed; (iv) charge transport: electrons [holes] migrate within the acceptor [donor] material towards their respective electrodes; high and balanced charge-carrier mobilities are required; and (v) charge collection: good contacts as well as favorable energy level alignments at the organic/electrode interfaces should be achieved. Increasing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) can be realized through improvement in molecular design and optimization of device structure.
Recent experiments have demonstrated relatively high PCE's in polythiophene/fullerene and oligothiophene/fullerene solar cells. For instance, organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells based on a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) made of regioregular poly(3-alkylthiophenes) (P3ATs) and the fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) exhibit PCE values as high as 3–5%;13–17 even higher values are reported when using [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as acceptor, due to its stronger absorption across the visible region with respect to PC61BM.17 Small-molecule BHJ OPV cells consisting of α-sexithienyl (6T) and fullerene (C60 and C70) have also been fabricated and display reasonably high efficiencies (about 2%).18,19 Similar PCE's were measured in photovoltaic devices using an oligothiophene–fullerene dyad mixed with either an oligothiophene or PCB61M.20
Compared to fullerene derivatives, perylenetetracarboxydiimide (PDI) derivatives not only display good electron accepting properties,21 large exciton diffusion lengths,22 and high electron mobilities,23–26 but also exhibit stronger and broader light absorption.23,27 Therefore, PDI derivatives can be expected to be a good alternative to fullerenes as acceptor materials for OPV cells. However, a very low PCE (around 0.4%) was observed by Friend et al. for OPV cells based on poly(3-hexylthiophene):N,N′-bis(1-ethylpropyl)-3,4:9,10-perylene bis(tetracarboxydiimide) (P3HT:EPPTC) blends under illumination of 0.16 mW cm−2 monochromatic light at 540 nm;28 under 100 mW cm−2 white-light illumination, the PCE for a morphology-optimized P3HT:EPPTC blend was found to be 0.25%.29 Shin et al. have also reported that OPV devices based on blends of P3HT and PDIs with a variety of functional groups present a highest PCE of only 0.18% under 1 sun AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2).30Oligothiophene/PDI-based OPV devices also demonstrate low performance. For instance, a conversion efficiency of only 0.59% was reported for bilayer heterojunction OPV cells using α-octathienyl and 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic bisbenzimidazole under white-light illumination at 105 mW cm−2;31 an even lower value (0.02%) was obtained for those using α-quinquethienyl and N,N′-bis(3,5-dimethylphenyl)-3,4:9,10-perylenebis(dicarboximide).32 In addition, the efficiency for devices based on dendritic oligothiophene bearing PDI units was estimated to be less than 0.40% under 10 µW cm−2 illumination at 410 nm.33,34 Although the light intensity varies from experiment to experiment and influences the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the OPV devices, the overall power conversion efficiency is only weakly dependent on light intensity.35 Thus, it appears reasonable to conclude that the performance of oligo- or poly-thiophene/PDI solar cells is significantly lower (by nearly one order of magnitude) with respect to devices based on oligo- or poly-thiophene and fullerene.
Here, in order to provide some understanding of the reasons for this difference, we have carried out a comparative study of the D/A complexes present in oligothiophene–PDI or oligothiophene–fullerene OPV devices. We have investigated the charge-transfer (CT) and charge-recombination (CR) processes at the D/A interface by means of quantum-chemical methods. We chose α-sexithienyl (6T) as the representative for oligo- and poly-thiophene materials and C60 and N,N′-dimethyl-PDI (Me-PDI) to represent the fullerene and PDI derivatives, respectively. The electronic couplings and electron-transfer rates were evaluated for the model intermolecular configurations illustrated in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Illustration of the model intermolecular configurations for the 6T/PDI (a) and 6T/C60 (b and c) complexes. The 6T molecule is parallel to the long axis of the Me-PDI molecule (configuration a), and to one of the carbon–carbon double bonds (configuration b) or hexagons (configuration c) for C60; the (perpendicular) intermolecular distance is fixed at 3.5 Å. 
2. Methodology
The 6T, C60, and Me-PDI molecular geometries for the ground and lowest triplet states, and the charged (ionic) states were optimized with density functional theory (DFT). The geometries for the lowest singlet state were optimized by time-dependent DFT (TDDFT). Based on each of the optimized geometries, the total energies for the ground, excited, and charged states were evaluated by the same DFT or TDDFT method that was applied in the geometry optimization. All the DFT and TDDFT calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G** level as implemented in the Gaussian-09 program.36 The ground-state geometry for 6T was kept coplanar since oligo- and poly-thiophenes tend to crystallize in the solid state with the thiophene units coplanar.37,38
To evaluate the rates of exciton dissociation and charge recombination, we exploited the semi-classical model of Marcus electron-transfer theory:39,40 (1)here, kB and ħ denote the Boltzmann and Planck constants, respectively; T is the temperature (set to 300 K in our calculations); λ represents the reorganization energy, ΔG0 the Gibbs free energy of electron-transfer reaction, and VIF the electronic coupling between the initial and final states.
The electronic coupling VIF can be evaluated by a diabatic-state approach that was recently developed by our group:41,42 VIF = 〈ψI|H|ψF〉(2)here, the initial and final states (ΨI and ΨF) are the local (molecular) excited state and charge-transfer (CT) state (ΨLE and ΨCT) for the exciton-dissociation process or the CT state and ground state for the charge-recombination (CR) process, respectively. The states ΨLE and ΨCT are spin-adapted diabatic states that are constructed as antisymmetrized products of the isolated donor and acceptor wavefunctions: (3) (4)where S and M denote the total spin and spin projection of the diabatic states for the donor–acceptor complex; ΨmD/A is the mth excited state of the isolated neutral donor or acceptor with spin Sm and spin projection Mm; and ΨmD+/A− corresponds to the oxidized donor or reduced acceptor. The  terms represent the Clebsch–Gordan coefficients that result in the linear combination of the isolated wavefunction products to be an eigenfunction of the total spin. For the sake of simplicity, we computed the isolated excited and charged states and then the electronic couplings in the framework of the semiempirical intermediate neglect of differential overlap (INDO) Hamiltonian43 coupled to a single configuration interaction (SCI) scheme. The Mataga–Nishimoto potential was used to describe the Coulomb repulsion term.44,45 The configuration active space consisted of all the π-type molecular orbitals (MOs) for 6T (18 occupied orbitals and 12 virtual orbitals, 18 × 12), PDI (18 × 14), and C60 (30 × 30). All the charged configurations (compared to the Hartree–Fock electronic configuration, the positively charged configurations lack an electron on one of the occupied π-type orbitals, while the negatively charged configurations have an additional electron on one of the virtual π-type orbitals) were used as the reference determinants to calculate the cationic states for 6T and anionic states for PDI and C60.
Since the lowest CT states as well as the local-excited states for C60 are orbitally degenerate, we have calculated the effective electronic coupling (Veff) as:42 (5)where gI is the orbital multiplicity of the initial diabatic state, and can be calculated as the product of the multiplicities of the initial monomer states (gi × gj).
3. Results and discussion
Our goal here is to analyze the rates of exciton dissociation and charge recombination for intermolecular configurations that are meant to model the interfacial geometries of the complexes in 6T/PDI and 6T/C60 solar cells, and to estimate how these rates might influence device performance. According to eqn (1), there are three key parameters governing the electron-transfer processes: the Gibbs free energy ΔG0, the reorganization energy λ, and the electronic coupling VIF. We first discuss these parameters before turning to a description of the rates of exciton dissociation and charge recombination.
3.1. Gibbs free energy
If we ignore the entropy contribution, ΔG0 can be estimated as the energy difference between the diabatic initial and final states. The energy of the diabatic states is composed of the total energies of the isolated states of the donor and acceptor and the Coulomb energy between the donor and acceptor. The Coulomb energy can be computed as the sum of the Coulombic interactions between the atomic charges of the donor and acceptor; for instance, the Coulomb energy between the donor cation and acceptor anion can be written as: (6)where qd and qa are the partial charges (obtained via an INDO Mulliken population analysis) on atom d of the donor cation and atom a of the acceptor anion, respectively; rda is the distance between atoms d and a; ε0 is the vacuum permittivity and ε corresponds to the medium (here, we have taken ε = 4). The calculated results show that the Coulomb energies for the diabatic local (intramolecular) states of the D/A complexes are vanishingly small (<0.01 eV), while those for the diabatic CT states become very significant. Thus, using the total energy of the diabatic ground state as the reference, the energies of the local-excited states for the D/A complexes are approximated as the excitation energies of the isolated molecules; on the other hand, the energy of the lowest CT state must include the contribution from the Coulomb interactions: ECT = IPD + EAA + EcoulD+/A−(7)where IPD is the ionization potential of the donor and EAA the electron affinity of the acceptor. We now discuss the excitation energies for the lowest singlet and triplet excited states and ionization energies in 6T, PDI, and C60, as well as the Coulomb attraction term for the CT states of the complexes.
The excitation energies and ionization energies are listed in Table 1. From an analysis of the absorption spectra, the electronic origin (0–0 transition) in 6T is found at ca. 2.5 eV in (dioxane and CH2Cl2) solution.46,47 In the solid state, the 0–0 transition is shifted down in energy by some 0.1–0.2 eV.46,48,49 As can be seen in Table 1, the TDDFT results (2.38 and 2.22 eV for vertical and adiabatic values, respectively) and INDO/SCI results (2.37 eV, vertical value) compare well with experiment on the basis of the planar ground-state geometry of 6T. The lowest triplet excited state (T1) energy of 6T in 1,4-dioxane solution is estimated (from a combination of spectroscopic and calorimetric data for α-oligothiophenes (nT) with n = 1–7 (except for n = 6) and the linear relationship between the triplet energy and the inverse number of thiophene units) to lie at about 1.61 eV above the ground state.47 The T1 energy of 6T in the crystalline phase is evaluated to be 1.49 eV by extrapolating the T1 energies of nT (n = 2–5) measured by high-resolution photoexcitation spectroscopy.50 The DFT estimate for the vertical value, 1.71 eV, and the adiabatic value, 1.34 eV, is in good agreement with experiment, while the INDO calculations underestimate the T1 energy.

To improve the solubility, the PDIs are usually functionalized through N,N′-alkylation; however, the influence of the length of the alkyl chains on the electronic structure is negligible and will not be considered here. The S1 energy of 1-hexyl-heptyl substituted PDI in acetonitrile is determined to be 2.37 eV from the average wavenumber of the normalized peaks of the first absorption and emission maxima.51 Under the same conditions, the T1 energy is estimated to be 1.2 eV.51 In the crystal, the S1 energies of PDIs with different lengths of alkyl chains vary by no more than 0.1 eV; we take the value of 2.18 eV given by Me-PDI in the solid state.27 From Table 1, the TDDFT or DFT S1 and T1 energies are seem to compare well with the experimental data, while again the INDO calculations overestimate the S1 energy and underestimate the T1 energy. These trends are similar to those for the S1 and T1 energies of C60 that we discussed in a previous work42 (in Table 1, we simply list the results for C60 from ref. 42).
To assess the energy of the lowest CT state, we need the values for the ionization potential (IP) of the donor and electron affinity (EA) of the acceptor, see Table 1. These two quantities are strongly modified by electronic polarization contributions when going from the gas phase to the solid state.52,53 From ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy in thin films, the IP of 6T has been determined to be 5.3 eV.54 Intriguingly, the EA values for PDI and C60 reported in the literature vary from −3.95 to −4.4 eV and from −3.5 to −4.5 eV, respectively. Several representative values of EA for these systems estimated by inverse photoelectron spectroscopy are given in Table 1.55–59 We also note that solution electrochemical data suggest that the reduction potentials of PDI and C60 are about −1.0 eV versusferrocene/ferrocenium,60,61 which would imply that the EA's of these systems are very similar and around −3.8 eV. Finally, we point out that the difference between the calculated and experimental EA values for PDI is on the order of the polarization energy estimated by Gerischer and Willig (∼1.3 eV).62
The Coulomb energies of the CT states are shown in Fig. 2. The electrostatic interactions lead to a significant stabilization of these states, by up to 0.5 eV and 0.4 eV for the 6T/PDI and 6T/C60 complexes, respectively. For all the complexes, as expected, the Coulomb interactions are continuously reduced with increasing intermolecular displacements. Displacements along the long axis of 6T from 0 to 16 Å and along the short axis from 0 to 6 Å (the upper limit taken for these displacements is where the electronic couplings (nearly) vanish, see Fig. 3) result in a decrease of ca. 0.25 eV for complex 6T/PDI and 0.2 eV for complex 6T/C60 (in absolute values of the Coulomb energy). When considering the same displacements along the long and short axes, the Coulomb attraction in the 6T/PDI complex is about 0.05 eV stronger than that in the 6T/C60 complex, due to the fact that a larger number of atoms in PDI are close to the 6T molecule.

 Fig. 3  Evolution of the electronic couplings to the lowest CT state for the ground state (VS0) and for the lowest local-excited singlet state on PDI or C60 (VS1A) and on 6T (VS1D), as a function of the displacements of 6T along the long and short axes, for complexes 6T/PDI (configuration a) and 6T/C60 (configurations b and c). 
Since organic solar cells are fabricated in the form of thin films, we have made use of the experimental solid-state values for the excitation and ionization energies in the calculations of the exciton-dissociation and charge-recombination rates; in the case of EA values, due to large uncertainty in experimental solid-state data, we considered the same EA value of −3.8 eV for both acceptors. According to eqn (6), the CT energies in the solid state (which are the opposite of ΔG0 for the CR processes) are estimated to vary from 1.0 to 1.25 eV with increasing displacements for complex 6T/PDI. The corresponding energies are slightly higher for complex 6T/C60 (1.1 to 1.3 eV) due to the weaker Coulomb attraction. Our estimates of the CT energies in complex 6T/C60 are similar to the values (ca. 1.0 eV) for the CT states in P3HT/PCBM blends derived from electroluminescence measurements.67
Interestingly, the CT states lie around or even below the T1 states of the individual molecules, which indicates that triplet excitons could also dissociate to create charge carriers. This might be relevant especially for the 6T/C60 solar cells since C60 presents a high efficiency for intersystem crossing.68 Here, we have not considered the contribution from triplet excitons to the CT and CR processes.
For complex 6T/PDI, when increasing the displacements, ΔG0 for the CT process from the S1 state varies from −1.38 to −1.13 eV for 6T and is 0.2 eV lower in absolute value for PDI due to the lower S1 energy. For complex 6T/C60, the corresponding values for ΔG0 are −1.28 to −1.08 eV and −0.6 to −0.4 eV for 6T and C60, respectively.
3.2. Reorganization energy
The reorganization energy (λ) is normally decomposed into internal (intramolecular) and external (intermolecular) contributions. The former arises from the changes in the geometry of the donor and acceptor moieties and the latter in the electronic and nuclear polarization of the surrounding medium upon electron transfer. The intramolecular reorganization energy, λi, can be easily calculated from the adiabatic potential energy surfaces of the molecular states involved in the considered electron-transfer process. For instance, λi for charge recombination of the lowest CT state to the ground state is estimated as the sum of the relaxation energies in the ground state when the donor and acceptor relax from their ionic geometries to their neutral geometries. Similarly, λi for exciton dissociation can be estimated via the potential energy surfaces of the charged states.
The calculated molecular relaxation energies involved in the CT and CR processes are collected in Table 2. The values of λi for the CR process (sum of the changes in the ground-state energy from the cationic to the ground-state geometry for the donor and from the anionic to the ground-state geometry for the acceptor) are 0.20 and 0.26 eV for complexes 6T/C60 and 6T/PDI, respectively. The latter value represents the largest value of λi among all the CT and CR processes in both 6T/C60 and 6T/PDI complexes. For all molecules, the relaxation energies related to the ground state upon charging or removing the charge are found to be very similar. The λi values for dissociation of the S1 and T1 states of 6T and PDI are smaller (≤0.1 eV) than those for the CR process, while the reverse is true in the case of C60. In any event, the variation among the relaxation energies of PDI and C60 is very small, in the range of 0.01 to 0.07 eV.

While a few methodologies based on quantum/classical QM/MM approaches69 or a polarizable force field70 have been recently developed to compute the external reorganization energy (λe), these approaches remain rather complex and, to date, limited to applications to single organic semiconductor crystals. Our systems correspond to blends of two types of molecules, which further complicate an accurate evaluation of λe. The values of λe in a nonpolar solvent (toluene) and polar solvents (THF and PhCN) for the CT and CR processes in both fullerene–oligothiophene–fullerene triads and oligothiophene–perylenediimide dyads have been estimated to be 0.05 and 0.7 eV, respectively.71,72 As a result, here, we have assumed an averaged value of 0.5 eV for the overall reorganization energy, given the very similar values of λi and λe in the oligothiophene/fullerene and oligothiophene/perylenediimide systems as well as the polarizabilities of the donor–acceptor systems in nonpolar and polar solvents.
3.3. Electronic coupling
The calculated electronic couplings involving the lowest CT state for the 6T/PDI (configuration a) and 6T/C60 complexes (configurations b and c) are depicted in Fig. 3. The results confirm that the electronic couplings strongly depend on both relative molecular orientations and intermolecular distances.42 As the acceptor (PDI and C60) slides on top of the molecular plane of 6T, the electronic coupling shows an oscillatory dependence on the displacements along the long and short axes of 6T, due to the alternation in the bonding/antibonding pattern of the involved molecular orbitals.73 A larger extent of bonding/antibonding alternations for long-axis displacements with respect to short-axis displacements leads to a larger number of peaks and valleys in the electronic couplings. In most instances, the electronic couplings between PDI and 6T are significantly larger than those with C60 for both CT and CR processes due to the closer molecular packing between PDI and 6T. For complex 6T/PDI, the electronic couplings can become as large as 100 meV, while they only reach 40 meV in a very limited region for complex 6T/C60. Similarly, slightly stronger electronic couplings appear in configuration c than in configuration b for complex 6T/C60.
For complex 6T/PDI, in general, the electronic couplings to the lowest CT state are slightly stronger for the ground state than for the lowest excited state of the acceptor (PDI), but weaker than for the lowest excited state of the donor (6T). For complex 6T/C60, similar situations are found for these couplings in the case of configuration c, while in the case of configuration b the electronic couplings between the ground state and the CT state are in most instances the strongest.
3.4. Exciton-dissociation and charge-recombination rates
The CR and CT rates for complexes 6T/PDI and 6T/C60 have been calculated by taking into account the driving forces, reorganization energies, and electronic couplings described above; their accuracy will thus be limited by the approximations that were made for the determination of the parameters entering Marcus theory. The results are shown in Fig. 4.
 Fig. 4  Evolution of the CR rate from the lowest CT state to the ground state (kS0) and of the CT rates from the lowest singlet state on PDI or C60 (kS1A) and on 6T (kS1D) to the lowest CT state, as a function of the displacements of 6T along the long and short axes, for complexes 6T/PDI (configuration a) and 6T/C60 (configurations b and c). Here, EA = −3.8 eV. 
The electron-transfer rates display the same alternating modulation as the electronic couplings as a function of the long- and short-axis displacements, although the trends in peak values are different. All the CT and CR processes we considered correspond to exothermic reactions, namely ΔG0 < 0. In addition, except in the case of dissociation of the S1 state of C60, all the absolute values of ΔG0 are larger than the reorganization energy (ΔG0 + λ < 0). In Marcus theory (see eqn (1)), the electron-transfer rates reach a maximum when ΔG0 + λ = 0. Since the driving force for the CT process reduces with the long- and short-axis displacements, the dissociation rates of the S1 states of 6T (kS1D in Fig. 4) and PDI (kS1A in Fig. 4a) generally increase with displacements, while the dissociation rates for the S1 state of C60 (kS1A in Fig. 4b and c) decrease. For the CR process, the combination of the ΔG0 and electronic coupling evolutions results in a faster drop in the CR rates with increasing displacements (see kS0 in Fig. 4).

Fig. 4 illustrates that in most cases the acceptor (PDI and C60)-based excitons dissociate more quickly than the donor (6T)-based excitons, even though the acceptor-based excitons have relatively smaller couplings with the CT state. This can be attributed to the value of ΔG0 + λ becoming closer to zero for the acceptor-based excitons. The CT rates for complex 6T/C60 are larger than those for complex 6T/PDI when the excitons are on the acceptor, while these rates are similar when the excitons are on the donor. For both 6T/PDI and 6T/C60 complexes, the CT rates can be very large and generally reach ∼109 to 1013 s−1 for all types of excitons. Thus, our calculations suggest that the excitons are able to dissociate efficiently in both 6T/PDI and 6T/C60 solar cells.
Interestingly, for most complex configurations, the decay of the lowest CT state to the ground state for complex 6T/C60 is substantially slower than the exciton dissociation. In contrast, for a large number of intermolecular configurations of the 6T/PDI complex, the decay of the lowest CT state is similar or even faster than the formation of the CT state. When comparing the two systems, our calculations reveal that, in general, the decay of the CT state back to the ground state in complex 6T/PDI is more efficient with respect to complex 6T/C60; this conclusion also holds if we explicitly consider other EA values in the range −3.95 to −3.5 eV, see ESI†. Thus, it appears that for complex 6T/PDI, the CR process can efficiently compete with the dissociation of the CT state into mobile charge carriers. To evaluate more generally the impact of the interfacial configurations that can be present in BHJ solar cells, we have also performed calculations where other intermolecular orientations (generated by rotating the PDI or 6T molecule, see the results in ESI†) of the 6T/PDI and 6T/C60 complexes are considered. The results again demonstrate that the CR rates are much faster in complex 6T/PDI. Therefore, the lower performance of the thiophene/PDI OPV devices could be related to this highly efficient CR process.
4. Conclusions
We have investigated the exciton-dissociation and charge-recombination processes in donor/acceptor complexes of relevance to 6T/C60 and 6T/PDI solar cells by means of quantum-chemical methods. We have evaluated the electronic couplings and the CT and CR rates for different model configurations that can be present in bulk heterojunction devices. The results show that, with comparison to the 6T/C60 complex, the decay of the lowest CT state to the ground state in the 6T/PDI complex is much faster. Importantly, in most cases, this recombination could compete with the dissociation of the CT state into mobile charge carriers. Our results thus point to the fact that the poorer performance observed experimentally for the PDI-based devices could result from this efficient CR process.
While we are acutely aware of the limitations of our calculations (consideration of a single isolated complex, no explicit account of polarization effects), we believe that they constitute a useful step in our understanding of exciton dissociation and charge recombination at the molecular level. Work is in progress to take better account of the influence of the environment.
