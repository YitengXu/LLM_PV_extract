1. Introduction
In recent years, metal halide perovskites, with the general chemical formula ABX3, have attracted unprecedented attention in optoelectronic devices fields; A is a monovalent cation, typically organic (e.g. methylammonium (MA) and formamidinium (FA)) or alkali metal (e.g. cesium) cation, B is a divalent metal cation (e.g. lead, tin), and X is a monovalent halide (Cl, Br, I) anion binding to both A and B as shown with general crystal structure in Fig. 1.1 Since the first report on solar cells utilizing organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite as absorbers in 2009,1 these extraordinary materials have seen rapid development, and have recently achieved an amazing power conversion efficiency of 22.1% in solar cells.2 Regarding perovskite LEDs, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of an organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite LED was first reported as 0.76% in 2014,3 and has made a great leap forward to 11.7% within three years.4,5 In parallel with the progress of hybrid perovskites, the EQE of all-inorganic perovskite LEDs also saw rapid development from 0.12%6 to 8.73% within 2 years,7,8 which has been called the “perovskite fever”.

Metal halide perovskites are promising candidates for use in photodetectors (PDs), due to their phenomenal optical and electronic properties such as large absorption coefficient, long carrier diffusion, large carrier mobilities, and so on.9–11 The excellent combination of effective light absorption with tailorable absorption spectra and high charge carrier mobility in the broadband range of perovskites, makes them different from other photosensitive materials that can cover a variety of applications and not be limited to some band of specific applications. They have demonstrated outstanding performance with rapid progress. In 2014, Hu et al. first fabricated the organolead halide perovskite based PD on a flexible ITO substrate,12 which is sensitive to a wide range of light, from ultraviolet (UV) to the entire visible light region. Dou et al. demonstrated a solution-processed PD based on organic–inorganic perovskite (MAPbI3−xClx) thin film with a peak detectivity (D*) of 1014 Jones at 0 V bias covering the range of 300–800 nm.13 With the deepening of the research, PDs based on single crystal (SCs) perovskites extended the absorption to the tail end of the near infrared region (NIR) of the spectrum.14 Xu et al. further synthesized MA0.5FA0.5Pb0.5Sn0.5I3, obtaining broad photoresponse from 350 to 1000 nm, and the D* was over 1012 Jones in the range 800 to 1000 nm.15 Furthermore, the special detection of X-ray and gamma-rays has also been demonstrated using perovskite SCs.16,17
To the best of our knowledge, the optimal responsivity (R) of perovskite PDs is 109 A W−1, D* is over 1016 Jones, and the fastest response time is about 1 ns. The properties are comparable to or even better than several popular materials as well as commercial silicon, as summarized in Fig. 2. On the basis of outstanding performance, perovskite PDs have been applied as the mainstay in the fields of visible-light imaging,18 X-ray imaging,19 and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurement,20 and have experienced a great upsurge in research. However, many existing problems need to be resolved and new applications are waiting to be developed.

In this critical review, we will give a brief introduction of the synthesis and optoelectronic properties of metal halide perovskites, and dig into the recent progress of metal halide perovskite PDs, including their use in different spectral regions, strategies for device performance improvement, and applications of perovskite PDs. Finally, we provide a summary and outlook in order to boost the development of perovskite PDs.
2. Synthesis of metal halide perovskites
2.1 Solution-synthesis of low-dimensional metal halide perovskites
Since colloidal low-dimensional metal halide perovskite inks are compatible with some kinds of solution processes, and may exhibit new optoelectronic properties, their colloidal-solution preparation has developed rapidly in recent years. The synthesis methods mainly are divided into two categories: the hot injection technique and room temperature recrystallization, as shown in Fig. 3a.21 In 2014, Pérez-Prieto and co-workers demonstrated a nontemplate synthesis method for MAPbBr3 perovskite nanoparticles (NPs).22 The MABr and PbBr2 were dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and then added to longer chain alkyl ammonium bromide with oleic acid (OA) and octadecene (ODE). Acetone was then added to induce precipitation, to obtain the 6 nm-sized MAPbBr3 perovskite NPs. This was the first report on nano-sized MAPbBr3, and is similar to the hot-injection technique. The synthesis of fully inorganic perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) rapidly developed due to their higher stability.23 Maksym V. Kovalenko's group first reported cesium lead halide perovskites (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, and I) NCs by injecting the preheated Cs precursor into the PbX2 solution at 140–200 °C; the NCs were monodisperse with 4–15 nm edge lengths.24

Although good quality perovskite NCs have been obtained through the hot injection method, it is not beneficial for increasing production due to high-temperature heating and the extra procedure of injection.25 Soon, simple and scalable synthesis methods were developed. Zhong's group developed a convenient method by adding the precursor perovskite solution to an insoluble nonpolar solvent (e.g. toluene) with long-chain organic ligand, which is called ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP) strategy.26 Rogach et al. demonstrated the size-tunable MAPbBr3 perovskite QDs by variation of the LARP method.27 Subsequently, the room-temperature synthesis of all-inorganic perovskite QDs was investigated, Zeng's group reported CsPbX3 QDs at room temperature according to supersaturated recrystallization; the free-injection reaction happened within a few seconds and did not need gas protection.28 Perovskite QDs have high PL QYs (70–95%) and narrow FWHMs (18–35 nm), which are comparable to QDs synthesized at high temperatures. The whole process is conducted at room temperature in an inert atmosphere, and it is easy to obtain scale-up samples.
Other methods like emulsion synthesis32 and droplet-based microfluidic platforms33 were reported. In addition, thanks to the ionic characteristics of perovskites, the metal halide perovskite NCs could be treated post-synthesis via halide ion exchange to modify their compositions, which have comparable structural and optical qualities to directly-synthesized NCs.34–36
Since optoelectronic properties will vary with different morphologies such as nanowires (NWs), nanorods (NRs), two-dimensional nanosheets (2D NSs), etc., morphology control has been widely studied (Fig. 3b–e). A. Paul Alivisatos et al. reported quasi-2D CsPbBr3 nanoplates (NPLs), and they further achieved CsPbI3, CsPbCl3 NPLs through anion exchange.37 Song et al. synthesized 2D CsPbBr3 NSs with a thickness of about 3.3 nm and successfully fabricated a high performance PD based on it.30 A number of reports of quasi-2D layered structure of hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite were also reported. 2D hybrid perovskites of (C4H9NH3)2PbBr4,38 R2(CH3NH3)n−1MnX3n+1 (R is a long-chain amine),39,40 (C8H9NH3)2PbX4,41 (CH3(CH2)3NH3)2(CH3NH3)n−1PbnI3n+1,42 and PEA2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (PEA = C8H9NH3)43 emerged, and their photoluminescence properties were tunable. One-dimensional (1D) perovskites like NWs and NRs obtained by solution-processes29,44,45 and vapor growth46 were also reported, due to the inherent 1D photonic and electronic properties. So far, various methods of perovskite nanostructure synthesis from 3D to 0D have been investigated, and it is easy to implement high-quality perovskite nanostructure synthesis using simple techniques, but the clear question of the mechanism of nucleation and growth still exists.
2.2 Metal halide perovskites thin films
The main applications of metal halide perovskites are focused on optoelectronic devices, and obtaining high-quality thin film is crucial. Thus the assembly of perovskite thin films is a key point and has been studied by a number of methods. For the as-synthesized perovskite nanostructures, the thin films can be prepared through solution processes such as drop-casting, spin coating, centrifugal-casting, blade coating, spray coating, and so on (Fig. 4a–c).31,47–49 These methods are easy to operate and compatible with all kinds of perovskite inks. Besides these methods, metal halide perovskite films can be directly prepared by the extra synthetic steps of nanostructures. The preparation methods of perovskite films in PDs can be categorized into three processes, i.e. vacuum, solution, and hybrid.

(f) Freeze-drying recrystallization from ref. 53 Copyright, 2017 Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 
According to the numbers of operating steps, solution processing could be further divided into two types, single step and sequential deposition. Both processes could deposit films with various stoichiometric ratios. In a typical example for the single step process, the precursor solution of perovskite with certain components was dissolved in a selected solvent, and the thin film was prepared via solution processing. Hu et al. fabricated the MAPbI3 film with 40 wt% of MAPbI3/γ-butyrolactone solution by drop-casting at a rate of 500 rpm.12 Besides, various solvents and the solution method were chosen according to the actual requirements of the device.13,54–56 Sequential deposition involves one or more solution methods used more than once. Huang's group demonstrated the continuous spin coating of PbI2 and MAI solution obtaining high-quality MAPbI3 film.20 Unlike this procedure, Liu and coworkers dipped the spin-coated PbBr2 film into CsBr solution for several minutes, and high performance CsPbBr3 film was finally acquired after annealing.57 As we expected, the solution processing could further meet the demand of large-area perovskite films,58 and boost the development of high-performance perovskite PDs.
Combining the advantages of vapor and solution processes, hybrid methods were first developed in solar cell applications by Chen et al., called vapour assisted solution processes (Fig. 4d).51 A PbI2 layer was first deposited by spin coating, and subsequently treated with the desired MAI vapour. Another similar hybrid method, which overturns the order of vapour and solution process, was reported.59 They firstly prepared the PbCl2 layer by thermal evaporation, and the MAPbCl3 film was obtained by spin coating MACl solution onto previous PbCl2 layer with annealing. For vapour deposition, dense and compact perovskite films were obtained using the co-evaporation (Fig. 4e) and sequential vapour deposition methods as proven in solar cells.52,60 However, high performance perovskite PDs achieved by vapour deposition in the present report is rare so far. Xue et al. reported a novel procedure fabricating porous CsPbX3 films with enhanced light harvesting and charge transport ability via freeze-drying casting in a vacuum environment (Fig. 4f).53 This process is surfactant free and universal for both inorganic and organic perovskites.
2.3 Metal halide perovskites SCs
The demonstrated optoelectronic applications of metal halide perovskites are mainly based on their thin films assembled with nano- or polycrystalline forms. However, point defects and a large density of charge traps are broadly observed at grain boundaries and the surfaces of films, which hamper the optoelectronic properties of perovskites. Fortunately, SCs of metal halide perovskites sustain fewer grain boundaries and better properties, such as higher carrier mobility, longer diffusion lengths and lifetimes. In the first half of 2014, metal halide perovskite SCs were reported;61,62 soon after, Andrea Pisoni et al.63 and Dang et al.64 synthesized bulk MAPbI3 SCs by precipitation from the precursor solution at constant and decreasing temperature, respectively. Later, Dong Shi et al. reported MAPbBr3 and MAPbI3 SCs with volumes greater than 100 mm3 using the antisolvent vapor-assisted method (Fig. 5a),65 and these perovskite crystals possessed carrier diffusion lengths exceeding 10 μm. At almost the same time, Huang's group developed the top-seed solution growth (TSSG) method, obtaining the MAPbI3 SCs with electron–hole diffusion lengths exceeding 175 μm under 1 Sun illumination.10

Opt. Mater. (f) Photograph taken from the as-grown MAPbI3 crystals from ref. 68 Copyright, 2015 Adv. Mater. 
Although the excellent properties of metal halide perovskite SCs have huge potential in optoelectronic applications, the slow growth rates still hinder the development of practical applications. Makhsud I. Saidaminov et al. observed the phenomenon of inverse temperature solubility in certain solvents of MAPbX3 perovskites, and a rapid crystal growth process was developed based on this phenomenon.69 This method was further utilized for rapid FAPbX3 SCs growth.70,71 Liu et al. exhibited a facile solution method to prepare MAPbX3 perovskite crystals;68 the larger crystals grew by repeatedly using the previous-step-grown crystals as seed crystals for the next cycle (Fig. 5c), and the largest crystal reached 71 mm × 54 mm × 39 mm (Fig. 5f). Then, they grew 20-mm-large single crystalline FAPbX3 using a similar method (Fig. 5d).67 Considering the better stability of inorganic CsPbX3 perovskites, the synthesis of their SCs was also investigated. Unlike with solution synthesis, Song et al. reported ultra-large 25 cm3-volume CsPbBr3 SC ingots by a modified Bridgman growth method (Fig. 5b and e),66 and a low trapping state density of 1 × 109 cm−3 was achieved. These metal halide perovskite SCs with great optoelectronic properties pave the way for future optoelectronic device applications.
3. Optoelectronic properties
The intriguing optoelectronic properties of metal halide perovskites stem from the intrinsic characteristics they possess. Metal halide perovskites exhibit strong optical absorption, tunable bandgap, long diffusion lengths and high carrier mobility. As we discussed in the previous section, the hot and crucial topic is how to regulate the optical and electronic properties; however, there remain several issues that need to be understood more clearly.
3.1 Optical properties
Metal halide perovskites exhibit strong optical absorbance, allowing for a much reduced thickness necessary to efficiently improve collection of charge carriers.72 Interestingly, the absorption is easily tunable from UV to near-IR by varying their components, size or dimensions. No matter what kind of cation is at the A site, the absorption spectra of metal halide perovskites are tunable by changing the halide components, which is the most common method; e.g., MAPbX3,26,73 FAPbX3,74 and CsPbX3 (Fig. 6a).35 Zhang and coworkers reported the MAPbX3 QDs with absorption edge from 400 nm to nearly 800 nm.26 Intriguingly, changing the cation of the A site and B site also caused an absorption wavelength shift. MA has a larger effective ionic radius compared to caesium (Cs), but smaller than FA. The corresponding absorption wavelength with same halide constituent was observed with the relevant trend of radius size, i.e. FAPbI3 absorbs to the longest wavelength while CsPbI3 absorbs to the shortest.74,75 In addition, the absorption edge displays a shifting trend by changing the element of the B site (Fig. 6b).15,76,77 Besides composition adjustment, tuning the size, shape and dimension of metal halide perovskites are ways of regulating absorption edges.39,78,79

(c) The visible optical absorption coefficient α and two-photon absorption (TPA) coefficient of CsPbBr3 SC from ref. 66 Copyright, 2017 Adv. Opt. Mater. 
Nonlinear absorption, e.g., two-photon absorption (TPA), was also observed in perovskite SCs.80 Song and coworkers reported CsPbBr3 SC with visible absorbance coefficient of about 105 cm−1, which is 10 times higher compared to organic dyes, and the nonlinear IR absorption coefficient is 3.7 cm GM−1 (Fig. 6c).66 The multimodal absorption makes it possible to detect a wider range of light in PD application. As we reviewed the numerous methods, metal halide perovskites showed significant potential for use in optoelectronic devices covering various wavelength bands. The outstanding optoelectronic properties will continuously cause a boom in research.
3.2 Electronic properties
Regarding semiconductor materials, charge mobility is positively related to charge extraction and transportation; thus obtaining larger carrier mobility is important. In recent years, many reports have unravelled the carrier mobility of metal halide perovskites for electrons and holes. Wehrenfennig and coworkers reported a high-frequency charge mobility of 11.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 8 cm2 V−1 s−1 for MAPbI3−xClx and MAPbI3, respectively, via transient THz spectroscopy.9,82 In addition, carrier diffusion length (L) is also a crucial parameter that could provide convenience for optimizing the device thickness and morphology.82–84 Both electron and hole L exceeding 1 μm for MAPbI3−xClx film were demonstrated by Snaith's group.11 Recently, SCs with the absence of grain boundaries and possessing fewer defects were widely investigated, showing ultralong carrier lifetime (τ), long L and high carrier mobility.85 Huang and coworkers reported the MAPbI3 SC with mobility of 164 ± 25 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 24 ± 6.8 cm2 V−1 s−1 for holes and electrons, respectively.10 After characterizing the τ (Fig. 7a and b), the longest L of metal halide perovskites was derived from MAPbI3 SC, exceeding 175 μm under 1 Sun illumination. Similarly, FAPbX3 and CsPbX3 SCs exhibited amazing values for carrier mobility.67,71 The ultralarge CsPbBr3 SC (25 cm3) was synthesized via the modified Bridgman growth method by Zeng's group. They demonstrated CsPbBr3 SC with superhigh values of 2290 and 2060 cm2 V−1 s−1 for electrons and holes, respectively (Fig. 7c).66 Combining the average lifetime τ of about 10.5 ns, the L for electrons and holes were calculated to be 10.9 and 9.5 μm, respectively. These excellent electronic properties lay the foundation for applications in PDs.

4. Perovskite materials as active layer for different spectral regions
PDs are the optoelectronic devices converting incident light into electrical signal. Based on their absorption and utilization of different spectral regions, perovskite PDs can be divided into visible light PDs, UV light PDs and infrared PDs. Besides, some special wavelengths could also be detected, such as X-ray and gamma-ray spectroscopy (Fig. 8). In the following section, we will introduce PDs operating in different spectral regions based on metal halide perovskites.
 Fig. 8  PDs operating in light of different wavelengths, based on perovskites. The diagrams inset were extracted from ref. 17, 19, 66, 86 and 87. 
4.1 Parameters of PDs
Regarding PDs, there are several key parameters to evaluate the performance of devices and compare with others such as responsivity, external quantum efficiency, response time or speed, bandwidth, noise equivalent power, and detectivity. We will introduce the definition of these parameters in the following section.

Responsivity (R). 
Defined as the ratio of photocurrent (Iph) or photovoltage (Vph) to the input light power (Pin) within the active area of the PD, and can be expressed as, (1)
Obviously, R indicates the available output Iph or Vph for a certain power at a certain wavelength of the incident light power, and can reflect the photoelectric conversion capability of PD.


External quantum efficiency (EQE). 
Defined as the ratio between the number of output electron–hole pairs and the incident photons per unit time. It could be expressed as, (2)where e is the elementary charge, h is Planck's constant, ν is the frequency of incident light, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength of incident light. From the equation, we can know that EQE is proportional to R.


Response time (or response speed). 
As the incident light is turned on, the output current of PD increases, and it decreases when the light is turned off. The rise and decay time (tr and td) of current are used to represent the response speed of a PD. In many reports, the tr (or td) is defined as the rise (decay) time from 10% (90%) to 90% (10%) of the maximum current. High response speed is needed in fields like optical communication or imaging application.


Bandwidth (Δf). 
The response speed is usually determined by its bandwidth (Δf), and the PD could operate in the range. A widely used parameter is the −3 dB bandwidth (f3dB), which refers to the frequency at which the response drops to −3 dB (50%) of its peak value.88


Signal to noise ratio (SNR). 
Noise always exists in PDs, and it is the decisive factor of the minimum signal that could be detected. It can be expressed as (3)
The signal can be distinguished from the noise as the signal power is larger than noise power, which means SNR is larger than 1.


Noise equivalent power (NEP). 
NEP refers to the power of incident light on the PD when the SNR is 1 with bandwidth of 1 Hz. The smaller the NEP, the higher the detection sensitivity; it can be expressed as (4)or written as below when P1 is the incident light power producing SNR = 1, (5)where  is the mean-square noise current at 1 Hz bandwidth in darkness.


Detectivity (D*). 
The detectivity D* is a key parameter comparing the performance of different PDs; it is defined as (6)where A is the active device area, Δf is the bandwidth.


Linear dynamic range (LDR). 
LDR indicates that during the range, the Iph has a linear relationship with the incident light intensity. This parameter is important for the light signal to be detected and precisely calculated in this range. It is given by LDR = 20log(Iph/Id)(7)where Id is the dark current of PD.

4.2 Device architectures
Metal halide perovskites were widely used as light absorbers in PDs. After a few years of rapid development, these device architectures can be mainly divided into three categories, i.e. the metal–semiconductor–metal (MSM), planar heterojunction, and phototransistor (Fig. 9). The simplest configuration is the MSM, including only the perovskite absorber and electrodes. As a typical example, Dong et al. fabricated a planar MSM-structure PD based on CsPbBr3 NCs thin film, the on/off ratio was estimated >103, due to the excellent optoelectronic properties of perovskite.31 This structure is widely used in perovskite PDs30,53 and can be transformed into vertical form with the active layer in the middle, and electrodes distributed in the top and bottom. The photo-generated electron-holes separate and are transported through the active layer; this allows direct investigations of active layers. For the lateral-MSM structure, Iph of PDs are always large, thus comparatively high R would be easy to obtain.89 However, the film quality and electrode distance (always larger than 1 μm), will strongly influence the response time and always result in slow response (small bandwidth), leading to a low D*. The most common architecture is the vertical topology as shown in Fig. 9b, it is similar to the structures of photovoltaics. In this topology, the perovskite active layer is sandwiched between the electron transporting layer (ETL) and hole transporting layer (HTL); each layer is thin and optimized to operate with low dark current, thus faster collection and transportation of carriers is implemented, compared to the lateral MSM structure.90 PDs with this structure exhibit short response time with wide bandwidth, and tend to show high D*. One of the deficiencies is that the Iph (or R) is not high enough. When the ETL and HTL are removed, the vertical MSM structure is constructed. As for phototransistors, three electrodes, i.e. source, drain, and gate, are needed, the typical structure is shown in Fig. 9c. To date, the phototransistors based on perovskites are mainly studied on the hybrid perovskite layer, e.g. graphene-perovskite;91,92 PDs with this architecture present some similar characteristics to lateral MSM structure, like high R and large Iph.

4.3 PDs for visible wavelength
For the applications in the visible spectrum like light communication, the PD is the crucial part of the whole equipment. Combining the excellent optoelectronic properties of perovskites, covering the entire visible region by tuning their composition, they are promising candidate for visible light PDs. In the early stage of investigation of perovskite PDs, the active layer was mainly perovskite films. In 2014, Hu et al.12 deposited MAPbI3 film on a flexible substrate with lateral MSM structure, which was the first PD based on organolead metal halide perovskite, covering broadband wavelength from the UV to the entire visible light region. This PD demonstrated the R ranging from 0.2 to 7 A W−1, corresponding to the optical spectrum from 310 to 780 nm under 3 V bias at 0.01 mW cm−2 irradiation, and the peak EQE value reached 1.19 × 103% at 365 nm with extra injection from the external electric field, which is about 103 times higher than that of graphene and graphene oxide. They also investigated light response under certain wavelength at 365 and 780 nm; the tr and td of the device were <0.2 s and <0.1 s, respectively. Flexibility was further examined, and the device performance remained almost constant after 120 cycles of bending, showing excellent flexibility and electrical stability. The above results showed the high sensitivity, fast response speed and great stability of the PD with simple structure, illustrating the huge potential in high-performance PD applications based on MAPbI3 film. In the same year, Dou et al. reported a novel solution-processed PD based on MAPbI1−xClx film with excellent device performance in the range of 300 to 800 nm using a multilayer structure.13 The design of the device interface and the thickness of the perovskite film were optimized. The water/alcohol-soluble conjugated polymer was used as the hole-blocking layer, thus reducing the dark current density, and high D* of 1014 Jones (at 550 nm irradiation) with no external voltage bias was realized. In addition, the optimized vertical-architecture PD presented tr and td of 180 and 160 ns, respectively, indicating that the vertical structure and suitable transporting layer are beneficial for rapid response rate and high D*. The performance is better than most of the reported organic and traditional inorganic semiconductor-based PDs. Dong et al. introduced a layered inverted structure device using high-quality MAPbI3 film as the active layer, and realized a high gain in the broad spectrum from 300 to 800 nm (Fig. 10a and b).93 The maximum gain could reach ∼500 at a low voltage bias of −1 V, and based on the high gain of this PD, the R is 242 A W−1 under the illumination of 740 nm. This reverse bias is beneficial for reducing the Id and enlarging the Iph. Furthermore, the response speed is fast, and the tr and td are about 10 μs and 5 μs, respectively. The high gain and R at low voltage allow the perovskite PDs to operate with low applied energy. Omar F. Mohammed's group demonstrated a sandwiched perovskite PD using a MAPbI3–MAPbBr3 heterojunction.94 There are no electron or hole transporting layers (ETL or HTL), the band gaps of the heterojunction allow broad spectral absorption, and the response time is about 100 ms, which is comparable to conventional perovskite PDs with ETL or HTL layers. This work suggests that the perovskite-only architectures can be good candidates for PDs, although the performance needs to be improved.

As early as 1999, Mitzi and co-workers had revealed that the metal halide perovskites exhibit beneficial carrier transport properties, and a high on/off ratio of 104 of the field-effect transistor using (C6H5C2H4NH3)2SnI4 as channel was reported.96 On that basis, Tom Wu's group fabricated phototransistors based on MAPbI3 and MAPbI3−xClx films (Fig. 10c and d).95 Interestingly, the ambipolar carrier transport characteristics were observed with these phototransistors, which means they could work in both p-type and n-type modes. The R of this device could reach 320 A W−1 under visible light illumination when VGS = −40 V, and the response speed is fast (less than 10 μs).
The PDs described above are almost based on MAPbX3 films; when active materials become perovskite nanostructures, such as NCs, NWs, NSs, and so on, the optoelectronic properties might change, resulting in changes in the device performance. In late 2014, Endre Horváth et al. first synthesized MAPbI3 NWs and fabricated the corresponding PD.44 The R was 5 mA W−1 under weak incident laser power (70 nW to 7 μW), and the response time was less than 500 μs, faster than that in MAPbI3 film. Later, MAPbI3 NWs were self-assembled and patterned, a better performance of PD was obtained with R of 1.32 A W−1 at 2 V bias with 650 nm irradiation (80 μW cm−2), and D* of 2.5 × 1012 Jones was obtained at 1 V with light intensity of 4 μW cm−2.97 Porous MAPbBr3 NWs was also used to fabricate PD due to many active sites, leading to good ability for absorbing light;98 the larger size of the perovskite microwires was also self-assembled and used to fabricate PDs.99 Similar to organic halide perovskites, 1D all-inorganic perovskite also have potential in PDs; Tang et al. synthesized CsPb(Br/I)3 NRs and constructed the PD, and the high on/off ratio (2000) was obtained.100 Considering the intrinsic flexibility, perovskite NWs have huge potential to construct flexible PDs. Jia Zhu's group converted perovskite film into NWs and fabricated flexible PD,101 and the large-area perovskite NW arrays on the flexible PET and the corresponding PD were demonstrated by Hu et al.102 As the 1D nanostructures of perovskite developed, perovskite NCs have also attracted interest due to their compatibility with solution processes. Jang et al. synthesized MAPbX3 NCs with reversible halide exchange, and then the high-purity NC films were obtained to fabricate PDs.36 The photo response can easily cover the whole visible spectra as the halide composition is reversibly tunable, and the performance could be greatly improved as the film quality is not good. The all-inorganic CsPbX3 also showed its potential application in PDs. In late 2015, the first PD based on all-inorganic CsPbX3 NCs was reported as the great on/off ratio of 105 was achieved.47
In addition to PDs based on 1D and NCs of perovskites, 2D perovskite materials have received widespread attention because of their advantages in electron mobility, superconductivity, and strong quantum confinement. They also have the natural advantage of flexible devices, due to the ultra-smooth surface being compatible with flexible substrates and higher optical response compared to bulk counterparts. A single unit cell of 2D MAPbX3 was prepared and used as an active layer for PDs with MSM architecture; a high R of 22 A W−1 under low bias and weak light (1 V, 10 pW cm−2) was observed under 405 nm laser illumination.103 Such high-performance PDs reveal that 2D perovskites are promising candidates in PD applications. All-inorganic 2D perovskites were investigated for PD applications,30,104,105 Song et al. first fabricated atomically thin, 2D CsPbBr3 NSs, and demonstrated the flexible PD with high performance (Fig. 10e and f).30 The PD is sensitive with a high on/off ratio larger than 103 and an excellent flexibility; all these results indicate that 2D perovskites have huge potential in high-performance and flexible PDs. PDs based on 2D layered hybrid perovskites were also developed,88 Tan et al. reported the first PD based on an individual 2D (C4H9NH3)2PbBr4 crystal;106 the ultrahigh R of 2100 A W−1 at low voltage bias (0.5 V) with 470 nm light irradiation (10 μW) was achieved.
From the perspective of PD performance, the grain boundaries and defects in the active layer materials will affect the carrier transmission, thus influencing the device performance. To solve these, perovskite SCs with no grain boundaries and less defects inside are great candidates. Lian et al.107 and Zhang et al.108 have constructed PDs based on MAPbI3 and MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 SCs, both possess great photoresponse with simple MSM structure. The MAPbI3 SC based PD presented a large R of 953 A W−1 at 1 V with weak light intensity of magnitude of nW cm−2 (532 nm, 2.12 nW cm−2). FAPbX3 with higher stability and wider range of absorption than MAPbX3 was also considered. Yang's group first synthesized FAPbI3 SC with size of 5 mm, and the corresponding PD was tested.71 Larger volume crystal was then synthesized by Liu's group:67 they sliced the large crystals into thin wafers and fabricated PD arrays. Later, self-powered perovskite SC PD were also investigated. Fang et al. fabricated the PD based on bulk MAPbI3 SC driven by a DVD-based triboelectric nanogenerator, showing a R of 7.92 A W−1 under white light (10 mW cm−2) at a bias of 4 V.109 Wu's group built Schottky junctions between MAPbBr3 SC and asymmetric electrodes realizing the self-biased PD.110 All the above PDs are sensitive to a wide range of light wavelength, but selective spectra PDs are needed for special light detection. Huang's group reported perovskite SCs applied to construct narrowband response PDs via the strong surface-charge recombination of excess carriers that are close to the surfaces, generated by short-wavelength light.111 The spectral response is as narrow as the FWHM of <20 nm, and the response spectra can be tuned from blue to red with different halide composition. A similar filterless narrowband response was also obtained by using a mixture of organohalide perovskite and an organic molecule with FWHM <100 nm112 and large-area MAPbBr3 crystal film.58 Besides bulk SCs, large-area SCs films exhibited comparable mobility and diffusion length. Makhsud I. Saidaminov et al. fabricated a large-area MAPbBr3 SC film and constructed the PD;113 it displayed amazing R, exceeding 4000 A W−1 at 5 V bias under white light irradiation and fast response time of 25 μs. Moreover, the D* of this PD exceeded 1013 under the same condition. Tom Wu's group used MAPbI3 microcrystalline film to design PDs that could operate efficiently in both broadband and narrowband regimes for the first time.114 They operate in the narrowband regime upon top illumination, and in broadband mode upon bottom illumination. As can be seen, the PDs based on low dimensional perovskites, SCs and the derivatives display excellent performance, the device structures are very simple, and the device properties could be much improved after the optimization of device architecture and material quality.
4.4 PDs for UV wavelength
UV detection is the key technology in the fields of flame detection, remote security monitoring, environmental monitoring, etc. Researchers have endeavoured to develop perovskite based UV PDs using their excellent optoelectronic properties. MAPbCl3 has a suitable bandgap of about 3.11 eV, its thin film and SCs were applied to fabricate UV PDs (Fig. 11a and b).59,115 Edward H. Sargent's group constructed a sensitive UV PD using MAPbCl3 SC assembled film, the response range is about 350 to 430 nm and the R of 18 A W−1 at low power of light (∼4 nW) was obtained, which might be due to the good crystalline film.116 The lead free perovskite MA2MnCl4 thin film was also investigated as a UV light active layer, due to the proper bandgap of chlorine based perovskites.117 Besides chlorine based perovskites, forming heterojunctions with other materials like ZnO118 and TiO2119 and extending the photo response to the UV region is a feasible approach. MAPbI3−xClx film coating with a fluorous polymer (CYTOP) produced broadband PD covering the UV spectra (200 to 800 nm), combining the advantages of CYTOP of UV-transparency and being waterproof, the device shows R of 7.85 A W−1 at 2 V bias under 254 nm illumination (0.85 μW cm−2), and it could operate stably for more than 100 days (Fig. 11e and f).86 As for the inorganic perovskites, Lu et al. married the CsPbX3 QDs to Si NWs radial junction structures, and the ultrafast and highly sensitive UV detection was achieved (Fig. 11c and d).120

Lett. 
4.5 PDs for IR wavelength
Developing the IR PDs based on perovskites is also important, due to their huge potential in IR imaging technology, biodetection, and information communication. The easiest way to realize IR PDs is to extend the absorption wavelength of iodide perovskites. MAPbI3 SCs have been put forward to realize IR detection,14,121 and the response wavelength could be further expanded to 1000 nm with changing MAPbI3 into MA0.5FA0.5Pb0.5Sn0.5I3.15 In addition, compositing other materials with perovskite is also a good solution, such as QDs,122,123 polymers,87,124 and up-conversion materials. Alexander A. Bessonov et al. coupled large PbS QDs (>6 nm) with the MAPbI3 matrix as absorbers on grapheme; shortwave IR photodetection was obtained,122 and the R was as high as 2 × 105 A W−1 under only 0.1 V bias with 520 nm photo illumination (1.6 mW m−2). Polymers like PDPP3T125 and PDPP3T:PC71BM87 were integrated with MAPbI3, constructing bilayers as the active layer, and the response spectra reached 940 and 950 nm, respectively. As for integration with up-conversion materials, MAPbI3 integrated with NaYF4:Yb/Er NPs126 and erbium silicate NSs127 were demonstrated, and the photoresponse was extended to 980 and 1540 nm, respectively. Moreover, the latter IR PD shows a fast response speed of about 900 μs, which is much faster than reported Si based PDs at telecommunication wavelengths. Cesium lead all-inorganic perovskite modified by up-conversion material was also exploited, Zhang et al. fabricated PDs based on α-CsPbI3 QDs modified by NaYF4:Yb,Er QDs (Fig. 12a and b), and the optical response covered a broad range from the UV to NIR region (260 to 1100 nm).128 Besides, two-photon absorption is another possible way to get IR detection that does not need the materials’ inherent bandgap in the IR region, both organometallic and all-inorganic perovskites have been successfully trial-produced. Sargent's group80 and Zeng's group66 have realized MAPbBr3 and CsPbBr3 bulk SCs of two-photon absorption (Fig. 12c and d), respectively, and they both used the bromide SC based PDs to detect 800 nm light. The parameters of the above typical PDs we discussed have been listed in Table 1 for comparison.

4.6 Detection of special wavelength
In addition to the ordinary light detection from UV to IR, perovskites have been used for detection of X-rays and gamma-rays, both of which have important applications in various fields, such as medical diagnostics, clinical treatment, and non-destructive testing of products.133 Wolfgang Heiss's group demonstrated solution-processed MAPbI3 for X-ray detection by direct photon-to-current conversion (Fig. 13a and b);19 the MAPbI3 based PD exhibited a high sensitivity of 25 μC Gyair−1 cm−2 and R of 1.9 × 104 carriers per photon. Later, Wei et al. fabricated X-ray detectors made of MAPbI3 SCs,16 and they increased the charge extraction efficiency by decreasing carrier recombination; thus, X-rays with an average energy of up to 50 keV were detected under a small reverse bias with a charge collection efficiency of 16.4% and a sensitivity of 80 μC Gyair−1 cm−2, which is much more sensitive compared to the commercial amorphous selenium based detectors. Early in 2015, Huang's group reported MAPbI3 SCs applied to gamma-ray detection with a 4% efficiency operated in gamma voltaic mode.10 After that, Kovalenko's group demonstrated FAPbI3 SCs for gamma-ray detection, and a 59.6 keV Am energy spectrum had been acquired.134 Recently, Wei et al., also from Huang's group, reported gamma-ray detection based on MAPbBr3−xClx SCs as they improved the carrier mobility and lifetime, thus increasing the signal/noise ratio to acquire the 137Cs energy spectrum (Fig. 13c and d).17

5. Performance improvement of PDs
Although the metal halide perovskite PDs exhibited excellent performance covering the broadband spectrum, further improvement of the device performance is still a challenge. Researchers have made significant efforts to solve this challenge by optimizing the perovskite layer and device architectures. In this section, we introduce several solutions to improve the device performance based on metal halide perovskite PDs.
5.1 Improvement of perovskites layer
The crystal quality, morphology, and smoothness of the perovskite active layers influence tremendously the optoelectronic properties, and further affect the performance of the PDs. As a result, it is important to fabricate high quality perovskite active layers. Li et al. reported the recyclable dissolution–recrystallization phenomenon of CsPbX3 NCs, and applied it to constructing smooth and compact perovskite film (Fig. 14a and b).135 The CsPbBr3 film could be self-healing by controlling the solubility equilibrium of the perovskite crystal solution, polar solvents, and surfactants. The corresponding PD exhibits improved R and EQE by more than 7 times, compared to the pristine state. Vapour-assisted processes were also used to fabricate high quality perovskite thin films, and the fabricated vertical-architecture PD with proper band matching achieved a high D* of 3 × 1012 Jones at −0.1 V.136 This high D* was mainly because of its low dark current. Besides, a novel process of nanoimprint lithography for improving perovskite film crystalline quality was proposed with 35 times improvement on R of the corresponding PDs (Fig. 14b and c).137 Despite the excellent optoelectronic properties of perovskites, defect ion migration occurs at high external bias. Jang's group proposed a solution involving the inhibition of ion migration for the reliable operation of perovskite based PD, and obtained high on/off ratios of 104.55 With electron beam irradiation, another method of tailoring performance, Pb0 was formed at the top and bottom surfaces of the perovskite, and it can act as a nice carrier conducting layer and increase the Iph of the PDs.138 As for low dimensional perovskite-like NWs, passivating the surface defects139 and crystallographical alignment140 were applied for improving the carrier transport. Yu et al. post-treated a 2D perovskite microplatelet film, achieving increased dimensionality and fused microplatelets,141 and the charge carrier transport was enhanced leading to high R and EQE of the PDs. The above methods all focus on the carrier transport ability of the perovskite layer, while light harvesting is also crucial for PDs. To obtain a larger surface-to-volume ratio and absorb more light under the same illumination conditions, the island-structured perovskite film was constructed.142 Xue et al. further constructed Mie-scattering porous interface-fused CsPbX3 films with enhanced light harvesting and charge transport ability synergistically,53 and the EQE of fabricated PD could reach 658% under 9 V at 520 nm irradiance (Fig. 14d and e).

The improvement methods in terms of the perovskite active layer can be divided into two categories, i.e. enhancing carrier transport ability and light-harvesting. Various techniques such as solvent treatment, vapour-assisted processes, electron beam irradiation, surface defect passivating, including bulk SC construction mentioned in previous sections can be utilized to enhance the carrier transport and thus obtain high-performance PDs. In addition, vacuum-deposition of perovskite layers has been demonstrated for solar cells with high efficiency,52 but reports about perovskite PDs obtained via vacuum-deposition have been rare so far. Therefore, this process can be potentially applied to fabricate high-quality perovskite thin films and enhance device performance. Constructing island-structure perovskite films that have larger surface-to-volume ratios is beneficial for light harvesting, which is another solution for improving device performance; however it might be harmful to carrier transport. Mie-scattering porous interface-fused film can be one of the possible solutions to realize both carrier transport and light harvesting enhancement.
5.2 Construction of the hybrid layer for the heterojunction
Despite the characteristics of large absorption coefficient and long charge diffusion lengths, the relatively low conductivity hampers the development of high-performance perovskite PDs. To solve this problem, perovskite hybrid layers that result in heterojunctions were investigated. Graphene with ultrahigh carrier mobility is an attractive candidate to enhance the conductivity of perovskites.143 Lee et al. fabricated a PD based on perovskite–graphene hybrid material; the electrons in graphene were transferred to the perovskite and filled the empty states in the perovskite valence band caused by photo absorption.144 The recombination of photoinduced electron–hole pairs was limited, leading to a large Iph; R and EQE of the PD were 180 A W−1 and ∼5 × 104%, respectively, under the illumination power of 1 μW at 0.1 V, and the corresponding D* was found to exceed 109 Jones. Similarly, graphene formed a hybrid with MAPbI3 NWs,145 MAPbBr2I island structure,92 and CsPbBr3−xIx NCs,146 and the hybrid graphene–CsPbBr3−xIx NCs successfully obtained amazing R and D* values of 108 A W−1 and 2.4 × 1016 Jones, respectively, under gate voltage (VGS) of −60 V at incident power of 0.07 μW cm−2. The high D* is attributed to the low dark current under reverse VGS and fast carrier transport of graphene. Furthermore, graphene was used as the top and bottom electrodes to sandwich the perovskite/WSe2 in the middle, hence the vertical structure phototransistor was obtained with an ultrahigh on/off ratio of ∼106.147 With high charge mobility like graphene, the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) hybrid with MAPbI3 showed 6 times higher on/off ratio than neat MAPbI3 PDs.148 In addition, a phototransistor with the structure of a nitrogen-doped graphene QDs (NGQDs)-perovskite composite layer and rGO layer exhibited a high R of 1.92 × 104 A W−1 at a VGS of 40 V and a light irradiance of 23.6 μW cm−2.91 A high D* of 2.71 × 1013 Jones was derived at the same time on account of the effective and fast path of electron transfer. Besides graphene and its derivative, 2D materials such as single or few layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) display tunable bandgaps and high mobility, which might promote charge separation in PDs. Typically, 2D MoS2149 and monolayer WS2 (Fig. 15a)150 were integrated with perovskite as the active layer to enhance R in PDs; the on/off ratio of the hybrid device was obviously enhanced with monolayer WS2 (Fig. 15b). Based on the same train of thought for improving carrier transport and reducing recombination, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) that showed ultrahigh charge carrier mobility, were used to construct hybrid material with perovskites. MAPbI3−xClx thin film,151 MAPbI3 NWs152 and CsPbBr3 NSs153 integrated with CNTs were verified with improving R, illustrating the generality of hybrid CNTs with perovskite for enhancing PD performance. In addition, PbS QDs154 was introduced in perovskites as the electron trapping sites to improve EQEs through the trap-assisted charge-injection effect. As a result, EQE, R and D* of ∼4500%, ∼ 15 A W−1 and 6 × 1013 Jones, respectively, were obtained at −2 V with light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Inspired by the proper bandgap of ZnO and the tunable bandgap of perovskites, hybrid ZnO/perovskites155,156 were fabricated to act as wonderful light absorbing materials, and meanwhile, the dark current of hybrid PD was suppressed. As for organic hybrid materials, Chao Xie and co-workers reported a phototransistor based on perovskite/PEDOT vertical heterojunctions in 2017, presenting an ultrahigh R of ∼109 A W−1 and D* of ∼1014 Jones at low voltage of only 0.5 V with weak light irradiance (14.15 nW cm−2) from the UV-visible to NIR region.132

Various materials formed hybrids with perovskites, and these hybrid perovskite layers provide efficient ways to enhance the performance of PDs. The promotion strategies discussed for hybrid layers can be classified into three classes. The first involves picking up another material with high carrier transport ability or high conductivity like graphene or CNT, which is beneficial for the separation of light-generated electron–hole pairs, thus enhancing the Iph and obtaining high-performance PDs. The second involves introducing other nanostructures, for example PbS QDs, acting as electron trapping sites to gain high EQE and D*. The third involves constructing a proper heterojunction like ZnO and PEDOT, which has a suitable bandgap; the hybrid layer will become an excellent light absorbing material, and the Id of the hybrid PD will decrease simultaneously. These suggestions provide possible ways for fabricating new hybrid perovskite PDs with improved performance in both R and D*.
5.3 Plasma enhancement
Outside of the perovskite active layer itself, we can also focus on the field enhancement. The surface plasmonic effect of metal nanostructures could introduce near-field enhancement and thus facilitate the light-harvesting of nearby materials. Based on this theory, Au NPs were introduced to PDs based on both organic–inorganic hybrid and inorganic perovskites. Sun et al. utilized this effect for the MAPbI3–graphene hybrid PD; the R was improved to nearly twice the original.157 Dong et al. demonstrated the synergetic effect of the preferred-orientation film and the plasmonic effect on CsPbBr3 based PDs, and a 238% plasmonic enhancement factor was obtained (Fig. 16a and b).31 They further calculated the electric field distribution in the vicinity of Au NPs via FDTD simulation, which was consistent with the experimental results (Fig. 16c).

(c) Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation of plasmon resonance enhancement of local optical field at a resonant wavelength of 532 nm from ref. 31 Copyright, 2016 Small. 
For the plasma enhancement, metal nanostructures like Au NPs were chosen to improve the light absorption of the perovskite via near-field enhancement. The good coupling between the waveband of the excitonic absorption of perovskites and the plasmon resonance of metal nanostructures is the precondition to realize plasma enhancement. Inspired by this, other metal nanostructures can be considered to construct plasma enhancement like Ag NPs. In addition, other light–matter interaction enhancement techniques reported in graphene based PDs, i.e. integrating semiconductors with optical waveguides and microcavities have not been investigated in perovskite PDs, and could possibly provide new directions.
5.4 Device structure optimization
As for device structure optimization, surface and interface engineering are crucial for the device performance. Huang's group coated double fullerene layers onto perovskite film, which passivated the charge traps and reduced the device noise, and the corresponding PD could detect the weak light intensity of pW cm−2 (Fig. 17a and b).158 Edward H. Sargent's group used the composite Al2O3/PCBM interface layer and reduced Id of the PD, and the D* reached 1012 Jones at −0.2 V with 0.1 mW cm−2 input irradiance;130 the R of this vertical architecture is only 0.4 A W−1 and almost irrelevant to light irradiance. The similar PCBM:PMMA blend interlayer was also used to reduce Id.159 Another way to reduce Id is by selecting the efficient hole extraction layer, thus offering a large electron injection barrier leading to the suppression of Id. Zhu et al. reported a NiOx:PbI2 nanocomposite structure acting as hole extraction layer and passivating the surface of perovskite simultaneously; the D* of this PD approached 1013 Jones (Fig. 17c and d).160 Tong et al. demonstrated a MAPbI3/C8BTBT heterojunction PD with high on/off ratio of 2.4 × 104;56 the C8BTBT layer acted as an efficient hole-extraction and waterproof layer. Tsutomu Miyasaka's group fabricated a device with planar structure, which could switch the dual function of photodetection and photovoltaic based on MAPbI3−xClx film.129 The value of R was as high as 620 A W−1 (10 μW cm−2) under reverse bias of −0.7 V as extra carriers were injected from the electric field, and the gain value reached 2.4 × 105% with small incident power (2 to 20 μW cm−2), while the value of D* was not given. The TiO2 blocking layer is crucial to regulating the performance of PD. Liu et al. further modified the TiO2 compact layer with PC61BM, facilitating the carrier transport at the interface between perovskite and PC61BM, and passivating the TiO2 film, thus obtaining a high D* of 4.8 × 1012 Jones at a wavelength of 500 nm with light intensity of 0.53 mW cm−2.161 The value of R was not as large as 0.339 A W−1, with over 80% EQE in the wavelength region of 375 to 800 nm; in short, the balance between D* and R is still challenging.

Along with the continuously optimized device structure, PDs based on perovskites have achieved success in a few years. Researchers have focused on simplifying the device structures under the premise of ensuring excellent properties; interdigitated electrodes and perovskite-only structures were tried. For example, Fei Wang et al. fabricated a simple PD by applying the organometal halide perovskite thin films onto interdigitated patterned Au electrodes;162 the width and space of the Au electrodes were both 5 μm, the narrow electrode space is beneficial for the high response speed (less than 20 μs).
In this section, device structure optimization is discussed. To optimize device structures, interface engineering is crucial between layers of perovskite PDs. Various methods listed such as coating double fullerene layers onto perovskite, introducing interlayer like Al2O3/PCBM and PCBM:PMMA, and selecting an efficient hole extraction layer, have successfully boosted the PDs performance. These layers are centred on passivating charge traps to reduce noises, reducing Id and boosting the carrier extraction, thus laying the foundation for finding points of penetration for optimizing the device structure to enhance the performance. In order to get a perovskite PDs with excellent performance, low-cost, high flexibility, and even wearable properties may be the target in the future.
6. Applications of perovskite PDs
PDs have wide applications such as light communication, image sensing, and other fields that need photoelectric conversion ability. Considering the excellent optoelectronic properties of perovskites, PDs based on perovskites will take full advantage of these fields. Deng et al. fabricated PD arrays with uniform MAPbI3 networks on flexible PET,18 and the PD arrays could detect spatial light intensity distribution to preliminarily demonstrate image mapping. Wei Deng et al. reported aligned single-crystalline MAPbI3 microwire arrays used for image sensors by blade coating.48 They integrated 21 × 21 pixels of this PD in a 1 cm2 area on PET, the response times of rise and decay for one pixel were 80 and 240 μs, respectively. Such rapid response is faster than the time resolution capability of human eyes. Fan's group reported a 3D array of 1024-pixel image sensors based on MAPbI3 NWs on a larger area of 3 × 3 cm using a vapor–solid–solid reaction process (Fig. 18a).163 High gain and low noise of perovskite PDs have been reported, and they have advantages in their use as digital cameras, due to their excellent response to visible light without a filter. As the X-ray detection was implemented, they also tested the applicability of imaging (Fig. 18b). The X-ray image clearly revealed interior details of the veins of the leaf, which were not apparent from the outside.19 Huang's group fabricated a high-response-speed of PD based on MAPbI3 film with inverted device structure, and demonstrated a time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) system based on it (Fig. 18c).20 The response time was about 1 ns, and they successfully tested several typical materials without an ultrafast preamplifier. This result illustrated that these fast perovskite PDs could meet the demand for high-performance scientific equipment, and might have many potential applications in other fields. Though perovskite PDs have been applied in several areas such as image sensing and TRPL systems, we believe new applications will be devised soon.

7. Summary and outlook
Inspired by the outperforming optoelectronic properties of metal halide perovskites, numerous studies have been reported exploring the synthetic methods, optoelectronic properties, and various applications of perovskites. This “perovskite fever” phenomenon has sparked an enormous development in the recent years. In this review, we centred on the progress of perovskite PDs in different spectral regions, and the promotion strategies of device performance with respect to the synthesis and optoelectronic properties of metal halide perovskites. So far, perovskite PDs have achieved amazing results in less than 4 years, and there is still room for researchers to use perovskite PDs for practical applications.
The construction of high-quality perovskite active layers is the essential element for obtaining high-performance PDs. As we mentioned before, improvement strategies can be divided into two categories, i.e. enhancement of carrier transport ability and light-harvesting. Various techniques have been proposed to enhance the carrier transport and thus improve Iph, such as solvent treatment, vapour-assisted processes, electron beam irradiation, surface defect passivating, as well as bulk SC construction. Constructing island-structure perovskite film and Mie-scattering porous interface-fused film can be a possible solution to realize light harvesting enhancement. Despite the above methods, vacuum-deposition of perovskite layers has been used for solar cells to obtain high-quality thin film,52 but there have been few reports so far about perovskite PDs via vapour-deposition; this could potentially be a new method for obtaining high-quality perovskite thin films and enhancing device performance.
For the hybrid perovskite layer enhancement, using another material possessing high carrier transport ability or high conductivity like graphene or CNT is a feasible way to help separate the light-generated electron–hole pairs, thus enhancing the Iph and obtaining high-performance PDs. Introducing PbS QDs as electron trapping sites has also been verified to be effective, reaching high EQE and D*; other materials could therefore be tried to boost device performance. In addition, constructing a heterojunction using proper semiconductors like ZnO, which has a suitable bandgap, could give the hybrid layer excellent light absorption, and cause Id of the hybrid PD to decrease simultaneously. These suggestions provide possible ways for fabricating new hybrid perovskite PDs to promote performance.
Apart from the active layers themselves, many research efforts have been made toward plasma enhancement and device structure optimization. Metal nanostructures like Au NPs were verified to improve the light absorption of perovskites via near-field enhancement. Considering the tunability of perovskites within the wide spectrum from UV to NIR, various kinds of metal nanostuctures can be considered to construct plasmon enhancement, e.g. Ag NPs. In addition, other light–matter interaction enhancement techniques reported in graphene based PDs, i.e. integrating semiconductors with optical waveguides and microcavities, have not been investigated in perovskite PDs, and might provide new research directions. Moreover, interface engineering is crucial between layers of perovskite PDs to optimize device structures. Various methods such as coating double fullerene layers onto perovskites, introducing interlayers like Al2O3/PCBM and PCBM:PMMA, and selecting efficient hole extraction layers, have been successfully demonstrated with elevated performance.
The applications of perovskite PDs are still rarely studied, but considering their advantages of high sensitivity and fast-response, they can be involved in or used to optimize many fields such as light communication, high-resolution imaging, etc.
