    , Accepted 19th February 2018First published on 24th February 2018AbstractHigh-performance air-stable PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8 organic solar cells were fabricated using mixed C60/C70 fullerene acceptors. Normal-architecture devices using PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8 with PC71BM produced a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.38%. An inverted-architecture, which possesses higher stability, was fabricated using a more economical PC61BM and PC71BM mixture with solution-processed PEDOT:PSS on top and produced a PCE of 8.15%. Exploiting the viscous nature of PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8, the slow evaporation effect was utilised to achieve an even higher efficiency of 8.73%. A stability test was conducted under operating conditions and our devices showed remarkably higher stability compared with PTB7-based devices.
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have received much attention as the next-generation of clean and efficient light-harvesting devices in recent years.1–8 Their highest reported power conversion efficiency (PCE) now exceeds 10% in a non-tandem device.9,10 As OSC technology matures, there are more important aspects to consider than efficiency, namely scalability,11 stability,12 and fabrication cost.13 Currently, low band-gap polymer donors, such as thieno[3,4-b]thiophene/benzodithiophene (PTB7) family polymers, are top performers in the field of OSCs.14–16 However, PTB7 family polymers are not good candidates from an industrial perspective because they require chlorinated solvents and a toxic iodinated hydrocarbon additive, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO).10,17–19 Also, the low mobility of PTB7 limits the film thickness to be less than 120 nm.20 As a result, these issues prevent scalable manufacturing processes, such as roll-to-roll processing, spray coating, and slot die coating.21,22 Furthermore, the intrinsic instability of PTB7 to air, water, and light is a major obstacle.23,24 Towards this end, it is imperative to use the inverted architecture, which achieves stability by avoiding the use of low-work-function metals and direct contact between poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) and indium tin oxide (ITO).25,26 However, the vulnerability of PTB7 to water means that low-cost solution-processed PEDOT:PSS cannot be used, and the choice of the hole-transporting layer (HTL) is limited to materials, such as MoO3, that are thermally deposited in a vacuum.24,27
PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8 is a low band-gap polymer with a band gap of 1.7 eV and consists of substituted benzodithiophene, thiophene, and benzothiadiazole.28–32 PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8 is compatible with non-chlorinated solvents, o-xylene, and tetralin, without the use of DIO as an additive.29,33–35 Excellent stability in air and high carrier mobility are the two main advantages of this copolymer.35,38 To date, the highest PCEs reported for PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8-based OSCs are 8.5% and 7.2% for standard and inverted architectures, respectively.35,36 The difference in PCE between the standard and inverted structures is rather large for PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8-based devices. Different molecular orientations of the copolymer are assumed to be the reason behind this.37
In this work, high-performance low-cost OSCs in the standard (Fig. 1a) and inverted architectures (Fig. 1b) were fabricated using PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8 and a mixture of phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) (Fig. 1c). We exploited the slow evaporation effect of PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8 to improve the efficiency of the inverted architecture with PEDOT:PSS. Standard-type OSCs with a combination of PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8 and PC71BM gave a PCE of 9.38% (an average of 9.20%) while using mix-PCBM38 gave a PCE of 8.96%. A PCE of 8.15% was obtained from inverted OSCs with mix-PCBM and an even higher PCE of 8.73% was obtained by employing slow evaporation.39 The mix-PCBM-based inverted devices were fabricated using PEDOT:PSS as the HTL and exhibited substantially higher stability compared with PTB7-based devices.

Results and discussion
Material characterisation and device optimisation
As the first step of the investigation, we carried out cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) (Fig. S1†). DPV measurements with a ortho-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB)/CH2CH2 1:1 mixture gave a clear potential, which was used in a combination with the absorption spectrum35 to determine the energy gap (Eg) to be 1.65 eV (Fig. 1d). Using this, energy diagrams of the devices have been drawn (Fig. 1e). Based on the energy diagram, standard-type OSCs were fabricated and optimised with respect to the electrode (Fig. S2†), concentration of the spin-coating solution (Fig. S3†), donor-to-acceptor ratio (Fig. S4†), spinning speed (Fig. S5†), spin-coating time (Fig. S6†), and thermal annealing conditions (Fig. S7†). Unlike in previous reports,35,36 an Al electrode with a 1:3 donor-to-acceptor ratio gave the best performance for our devices (Fig. S8†). In addition, due to the highly viscous nature of PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8 solution, spin-coating while the solution was hot without using a filter resulted in higher performance. Solvent compatibility tests revealed that the PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8-based devices showed high performance for all tested solvent types and additives (Fig. S9†). Having confirmed this, we used o-DCB without additives for all experiments. As the next step, we used three different types of PCBM electron acceptors. Fig. 2a shows that the PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8 and PC71BM combination-based devices gave a PCE of 9.38%. To the best of our knowledge, this is a record-high efficiency, but the PC71BM acceptor is known to be more costly.40,41 Therefore, less costly counterparts PC61BM and mix-PCBM were tested. The PC61BM-based devices gave a PCE of 8.84% and the mix-PCBM-based devices gave a PCE of 8.96%. The solar cells using mix-PCBM gave a slightly higher PCE compared with the PC61BM-based devices. This subtle difference was due to the higher open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the mix-PCBM device, which is expected for the standard architecture according to our previous report.38

Inverted architecture via slow evaporation
From the perspective of power generation, the stability of OSCs can be considered to be the most important factor. In this regard, the standard architecture is likely not the best choice, because it utilises metal electrodes with a high work function and acidic PEDOT:PSS is in direct contact with the ITO electrode.25,28 Therefore, we tested inverted OSCs using aqueous solution-processed PEDOT:PSS as the HTL on the active layer (Fig. 1b). Fig. 2b shows that high PCE values were obtained unlike those for PTB7-based devices (Table 1). We attribute this to the intrinsic high stability of PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8 against water. The photovoltaic data in Fig. 2b also show that the PC71BM-based devices gave a PCE of 7.10%, which is lower than that of the PC61BM-based devices (7.61%). The mix-PCBM-based devices, to our surprise, displayed the highest PCE among the inverted devices with a PCE of 8.15%. This higher PCE was due to their higher short-circuit current density (JSC), which arose from the greater interpenetrating area in the amorphous phase of mix-PCBM.38,42 On the other hand, the fill factor (FF) of the mix-PCBM-based devices was decreased because of the inherently lower electron mobility of mix-PCBM compared with PC61BM or PC71BM.43,44 Nevertheless, PCEs were lower for all of the inverted devices compared with the standard-type devices. We suspect that different molecular orientations of the copolymer37 were the reason for this phenomenon, given that some polymers exhibit a similar behaviour.45 To address this, the slow evaporation effect was employed to improve the PCE of the mix-PCBM-based inverted OSCs.39 PTB7 has low mobility, which means that the film has to be thin. So a high-speed spin-coating results in a dry film. However, PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8 has high mobility which allows fabrication of a thick active layer, which is wet after a low-speed spin-coating. Accordingly, by drying the film slowly, vertical separation can be induced in which fullerene acceptors migrate to the bottom and the polymer donors migrate to the top within the blend (Fig. S10†).46,47 As shown in Fig. 2c, the PCE increased from 8.15% to 8.73% as a result of slow evaporation. The increase in FF and JSC was due to favourable vertical separation.

Stability investigation of polymers
Having obtained high PCE by slow evaporation, the stability of the device was investigated. The vulnerability of the polymer donor to oxygen and moisture is crucial to the overall device performance and processing technique. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveals information as to the degradation of the polymers over time. Fig. 3a to f show the XPS data of PTB7 and PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8 thin films in ambience (40 °C, relative humidity 40%) before and after one week. It is evident that PTB7 was oxidised substantially after one week. The S 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 doublet with the 2p3/2 component at 164 eV is typical of S from C–S bonds in the polymer donors (Fig. 3a and d).48 After one week, the doublets become less defined which is due to the sulphoxide peak (SO) in the middle of the doublet by hydration.49,50 The appearance of an S peak associated with a sulphone group, –SO3− at 168 eV confirms degradation in PTB7, which is not observed in the XPS spectrum of PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8 (Fig. 3d).48,51 The C 1s peak shows a symmetric hydrocarbon-like main component at 284 eV due to C–C bonding in the side chains and aromatic rings (Fig. 3b and e). Two weak components are from C–S at 287 eV and –O–CO at 289 eV, which intensified after oxidation, revealing stronger oxidation in PTB7 compared with PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8.48,52 The O 1s peak in Fig. 3c broadened after one week, which indicates generation of CO at ca. 531 eV and C–O at ca. 533 eV.48,52 In the case of PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8, only marginal generation of C–O was observed (Fig. 3f). Looking at the intensity of the O peaks, it is clear that PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8 does not undergo oxidation as strong as PTB7. Overall, the peaks of PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8 shifted to higher energy, which is a good indication of stronger oxidation and degradation.

Stability investigation of the bulk-heterojunction
The bulk-heterojunction blend of polymer donors with mix-PCBM is reported to be more rigid than that with PC61BM because the heterogeneous character of the PC61BM and PC71BM mixture introduces crystal defects that prevent the domains from becoming large.38,53 The same was true for the PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8:mix-PCBM blend as observed in the atomic force microscopy (AFM) surface analyses (Fig. S11†). After annealing at 200 °C for 2 hours, the arithmetic mean surface roughness (Ra) of the PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8:mix-PCBM film had less change in its domains compared with PC61BM. Space-charge-limited current (SCLC) mobility data also corroborate the excellent stability of the PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8:mix-PCBM blend. Table 1 shows that the hole mobility of PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8:mix-PCBM is higher than those of PC61BM and PC71BM (Fig. S12†). This is due to low crystallinity of mix-PCBM in the blend. Despite lower electron mobility compared to its PC61BM and PC71BM counterparts (Fig. S13†), PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8:mix-PCBM retained its mobility after ageing (Fig. S14†). Since it is both the hole and electron mobilities that we have to consider, we can conclude that the stability of the mix-PCBM-based bulk heterojunction is high.
The stability of the PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8:mix-PCBM blend in the inverted solar cells was tested in air under constant illumination without encapsulation. For reference, we included data on two PTB7:PC71BM devices, one with a MoO3 HTL and one with a PEDOT:PSS HTL. As shown in Fig. 3g, the PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8:mix-PCBM devices were significantly more stable than the PTB7:PC71BM devices (Fig. S15†). PTB7-based devices with aqueous PEDOT:PSS in contact with the active later displayed a rapid drop in PCE, indicating that the stability of PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8 to water enables the use of solution-processed PEDOT:PSS.
Conclusions
In conclusion, both the standard and inverted architectures of PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8-based solar cells were fabricated using different PCBMs. Mix-PCBM-based devices showed higher performance and stability compared with PC61BM- or PC71BM-based inverted OSCs. Exploiting the viscous nature of PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8 solution, the slow evaporation effect was employed and it improved the efficiency to 8.73% through the use of aqueous solution-processable PEDOT:PSS. The inverted devices displayed a remarkably high stability compared with the PTB7-based devices.
Experimental section
Device fabrication
Patterned ITO substrates (15 × 15 mm) with a sheet resistance of 9 Ω sq−1 (Techno Print Co., Ltd.) were used. The substrates were sonicated sequentially in cleaning surfactant (Semi Clean, M-Lo), water, acetone and 2-isopropanol for 15 min each. The ITO substrates were exposed to UV/O3 for 15 min.
For the standard devices, a PEDOT:PSS dispersion in water (CleviosPVP, Heraeus Precious Metals GmbH & Co.) was spin-coated on ITO at 4500 rpm for 45 s. This was followed by active layer deposition at 1000 rpm for 30 s for the best performance. LiF and Al were thermally deposited with thicknesses of 1 nm and 100 nm, respectively.
For the inverted devices, ZnO was fabricated by using the sol–gel method in which a 0.1 M solution of zinc acetate dihydrate [Zn(CH3COO)·(2H2O)] (Wako, 99.0%) in ethanol (Wako, 99.5%) was stirred at 80 °C for 2–3 h. Next, an ethanolamine stabilizer (28% in weight) was added and the solution was left stirring for a further 12–15 h at 60 °C. The solution was spin-coated on ITO at 3000 rpm for 30 s. After the deposition of the active layer, either 30 nm thick MoO3 or modified PEDOT:PSS was deposited by thermal evaporation and spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 45 s, respectively. The modified PEDOT:PSS contains 0.5 wt% polyoxyethylene(6) tridecyl ether (Sigma Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc.).
For the PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8 photoactive layer deposition, a mixture of [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester and [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester in a 16:3 ratio (mix-PCBM) (Frontier Carbon Co., Nanom spectra E124) solution with a donor:acceptor ratio of 1:3 and concentration of 60 mg ml−1 in ortho-dichlorobenzene (anhydrous, 99%, Sigma Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc.) was prepared. The solution was left stirring for 2 h at 100 °C. The active solution was spin-coated onto target substrates at 1000 rpm for 30 s without a filter and kept inside a Petri dish for 40 min for the waiting effect. The devices were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min after the deposition of the top electrodes.
Characterisation

J–V characteristics were measured by using a software-controlled source meter (2400, Keithley) under dark conditions and 1 sun AM 1.5 G simulated sunlight irradiation (100 mW cm−2) with a solar simulator (EMS-35AAA, Ushio Spax Inc.), which was calibrated by using a silicon diode (BS-520BK, Bunkoukeiki). UV-vis absorption spectra were measured with a spectrometer (V-670, JASCO) at room temperature (298 K) on a 1.5 × 1.5 cm glass substrate. Atomic force microscopy (AFM; Multi-mode, Bruker) topography images were recorded in tapping mode. The structure of the electron-only devices was Al(100 nm)/active layer/LiF(0.6 nm)/Al(100 nm) and hole-only devices was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3(10 nm)/Al(100 nm). The mobility was determined by fitting the dark current to a model of a single-carrier SCLC, which is described by the equation: , where J is the current density, μ is the mobility, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the relative permittivity of the material, L is the thickness of the active layer, and V is the effective voltage. The thickness of the BHJ layer was measured with a DEKTAK 6M stylus profilometer. A blended solution of PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8:mix-PCBM, PC61BM and PC71BM were spin-coated onto Al/glass to form the active layer in electron-only devices, and onto PEDOT:PSS in hole-only devices. The LiF/Al electrodes (LiF = 0.6 nm; Al = 100 nm) or MoO3/Al were evaporated on the active layer in the electron-only devices and hole-only devices, respectively. The experimental dark current density J of PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8:mix-PCBM, PC61BM and PC71BM was measured under an applied voltage swept from −5 to 5 V.
