    , Accepted 5th March 2020First published on 6th March 2020AbstractThe highly efficient regeneration of nicotinamide cofactors has been successfully achieved with a quantum yield (Φ) of 7.9 × 10−3via photocatalytic transfer hydrogenation in the presence of the ruthenium complex Ru(tpy)(biq)Cl2 (where tpy = 2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine and biq = 2,2′-bisquinoline). The photocatalytic system is not only highly efficient but also tolerant to amino acid residues. The combination of this photocatalyst with glutamate dehydrogenase enabled the controllable and efficient synthesis of L-glutamate to be realized. A mechanism involving light-induced ligand exchange, decarboxylation and hydride transfer has been proposed. Kinetic isotope experiments revealed that the decarboxylation of [Ru(tpy)(biq)HCOO]+ to [Ru(tpy)(biq)H]+ was the rate-determining step with a small apparent activation energy of 3.2 ± 0.4 kcal mol−1. The hydricity of [Ru(tpy)(biq)H]+ was estimated, via reaction equilibrium, to be 40 ± 3 kcal mol−1.
Introduction
Nicotinamide cofactors (i.e. NAD(P)+ and NAD(P)H) are involved in most biological transformations involving enzymatic redox reactions.1–3 Efficient reductive regeneration of these expensive cofactors is not only important for economical application of these biological processes but also for novel artificial biotransformations (e.g. artificial photosynthesis).4 Over recent decades, enormous efforts have been devoted to the regeneration of cofactors using chemical,5 electrical,6 biological7 and photochemical4a,b methods. Of these methods, the photochemical regeneration of cofactors has obvious advantages. Not only can solar energy be utilized in systems that mimic photosystem I, it can also be used to control the regeneration of cofactors. This has great potential for the regulation of biosynthetic processes by varying the ratio of the reduced and the oxidized forms of the cofactors.8 Typically a photocatalytic regeneration system contains a photosensitizer that extracts electrons from a sacrificial reductant and an electron mediator that performs the dual electron transfer to NAD(P)+. In a pioneering work by Willner et al.,4a,b Ru(bpy)3Cl2 (where bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) was employed as a photosensitizer with methyl viologen (MV2+) as a mediator. As a result, NADPH was generated with a turnover number (TON) of 13 after 40 h based on Ru(bpy)3Cl2. Enzymatic reduction of butanone to chiral 2-butanol with this photocatalytic system was achieved with a 100% optical purity. To find more photosensitizers for use in artificial photosynthesis, organic dyes were screened extensively for this transformation by Park et al.9 Eosin Y, rose bengal and phloxine B exhibited high activity with turnover frequencies (TOFs) ranging from 1178 h−1 to 1537 h−1. Aside from homogeneous photosensitizers, heterogeneous ones like carbon nitride,4d,10 CdSe,11 TiO212 and COF13 were also successfully applied for this conversion. [RhCp*(bpy)H2O]2+ (M) is a widely used electron mediator that enables dual electron transfer from reduced photosensitizers to NAD(P)+ in the form of hydride, selectively affording 1,4-NAD(P)H. Apart from photochemical regeneration, M can also catalyze the transfer hydrogenation of NAD(P)+ with formate under mild conditions14 (Scheme 1).
 Scheme 1  The visible-light-driven transfer hydrogenation of NAD(P)+. 
Despite these advances in photosensitizer development, two problems for NAD(P)H regeneration still need to be addressed.2,3 In terms of the sacrificial reductant, amines (e.g. triethanolamine (TEOA), NEt3) are usually used giving toxic imine and aldehyde by-products. An inexpensive and renewable alternative is formate which only releases CO2 (bicarbonate) as a by-product. Although it is employed in the transfer hydrogenation of NAD(P)+, so far there has not been a report on the photocatalytic regeneration of NAD(P)H using formate. Additionally, the efficiency of the mediator M is much lower than that of the photosensitizers, which results in the use of a high concentration of M. For instance, the concentration of M used is 50-fold higher than that of the dyes (250 μM vs. 5 μM).9 Moreover, deactivation of M occurs in the presence of amino acid residues due to the coordination with thiol and amino groups.15 To overcome this, a compartmentalization strategy has been applied to avoid the contact of the metal complex with the coordinating residues in the enzyme. Ward et al. incorporated a half-sandwich Ir complex with a biotin tag into streptavidin, creating an artificial metalloenzyme and efficiently compartmentalizing the NADH dependent enzyme downstream from the Ir complex.16 For the same purpose, a half-sandwich Rh complex has been coordinated to a light-harvesting polymeric material for the photocatalytic reduction of NAD+.17 With the above two concerns on reductant and mediator in mind, we endeavor to develop an efficient photocatalytic transfer hydrogenation protocol for NAD(P)H regeneration that is tolerant of amino acid residues. It is noteworthy that Ishitani et al. have developed a bifunctional photocatalyst Ru(tpy)(bpy)(DMF)(PF6)2 which enabled the reduction of the 1-benzylnicotinamidium cation (BNA+) to the 1,4-dihydro form (BNAH).18 Under visible light, a ligand exchange occurred that switched [Ru(tpy)(bpy)DMF]2+ to [Ru(tpy)(bpy)NEt3]2+ and proceeded via an intramolecular redox reaction with a [Ru(tpy)(bpy)H]+ intermediate. Fast hydride transfer from this complex to BNA+ affords BNAH selectively. In this way, [Ru(tpy)(bpy)DMF]2+ functions as both a photosensitizer and a dual electron (hydride) transfer mediator. Importantly, the oxidation of NEt3 and the reduction of BNA+ occur on the same Ru center. Moreover, irradiation of Ru complexes is able to dissociate thioether and pyridyl ligands which are strongly coordinating and often cause the deactivation of metal catalysts.19 Thus, it is reasonable to expect Ru terpyridyl complexes to be tolerant towards amino acid residues in a photocatalytic reaction system. Inspired by these characteristics of Ru terpyridyl complexes, we employed them as photocatalysts to study the visible-light-driven transfer hydrogenation of cofactors using formate.
Experimental
Materials and general methods
All substrates and reagents were used as received from commercial suppliers unless otherwise stated. For the monochromatic light source, Kessil PR-160–456 LEDs (456 nm, max power = 40 W, FWHM ≈20 nm) were used for blue light. Green LEDs (525 nm, max power = 100 W, FWHM = 15–20 nm) and red LEDs (625 nm, max power = 100 W, FWHM = 15–20 nm) were provided by the Perfectlight company. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 400 MHz or 600 MHz spectrometer. Air-sensitive NMR experiments were carried out in sealed tubes. An NMR tube adapter was used to apply vacuum using standard Schlenk techniques. Deuterated NMR solvents were degassed using three freeze–pump–thaw cycles. Electronic absorption spectra were record on a Varian Carry 50 spectrometer. High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) measurements were performed on an mxXis II time of flight mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics Corporation). X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected on a Smart 1000 diffractometer (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) with a Mo K-alpha X-ray source (λ = 0.71073 Å) at 150 K. The SUPERFLIP72 program was employed for dealing with the collected data and the refinement of data was achieved using the SHELX-97 and OLEX2 programs. Analysis of L-glutamate was performed on a Shimadzu Prominence 20 HPLC system, equipped with a C18 column and a UV-Vis detector.
For a typical NADH regeneration procedure, a 2 mL aqueous solution containing 1 mM NAD+, 10 μM photocatalyst 7 and 0.5 M HCOONa was added to a Schlenk tube equipped with a rubber stopper and a sampling syringe, then the tube was purged with argon and placed in front of a green LED (40 W, 525 nm). The reaction temperature was kept lower than 40 °C through cooling with a fan. After irradiation for a defined time period, the reaction was sampled and the NADH concentration was analyzed with a Varian Carry 50 spectrometer at 340 nm.
Synthesis and characterization
Ru(tpy)Cl3 was synthesized according to a previously reported procedure.26 To a 500 mL ethanol solution of terpyridine (1.17 g, 5 mmol) RuCl3·3H2O (1.31 g, 5 mmol) was added and the solution was refluxed for 3 h with stirring. After cooling down to room temperature, a brown precipitate was obtained in a near quantitative yield. For complexes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6, 221 mg (0.5 mmol) of Ru(tpy)Cl3 was added to 50 mL of a water:ethanol (1:3) solution containing 0.5 mmol of the bipyridyl ligand, 20 mg of LiCl and 100 μL of NEt3. After refluxing for 20 h with stirring, the solvent was reduced to ca. 5 mL with a rotatory evaporator. The concentrated solution was kept in a refrigerator overnight, affording the crystalline product. The product was washed carefully with 2 mL of chilling ethanol and 10 mL of ethyl ether and then dried under vacuum.

To synthesize Ru(tpy)(biq)(HCOO)PF6, to a 1 mL ethanol solution of 30 mg of Ru(tpy)(biq)(MeCN)(PF6)2 or Ru(tpy)(biq)(Cl)PF6 was added 1 mL of a 5 M solution of HCOONa and the resulting mixture was stirred under irradiation with 40 W green LEDs for 1 h. Addition of some drops of a KPF6 solution afforded a black crystalline solid. The solid was poorly soluble in MeOH-d4, so signals in the 13C NMR spectrum were too weak to identify. To verify the product was a formate complex, DCOONa was used to prepare Ru(tpy)(biq)(DCOO)PF6. As shown in Fig. S26 and S27,† the 1H NMR spectra were identical except for the disappearance of the signal of the formate moiety at 7.37 ppm. Single crystals of Ru(tpy)(biq)(HCOO)PF6 suitable for XRD analysis were grown by vapor diffusion of n-hexane into a methanol solution at room temperature.

The tube was purged with argon and placed in front of a green LED (100 W, 525 nm). The reaction temperature was kept lower than 40 °C via cooling with a fan. After 1.5 h of irradiation, another 10 mM α-ketoglutarate was added and irradiated for a further 1 h. After irradiation for a defined time period, the reaction mixture was sampled and quenched with phenyl isothiocyanate as per the following procedure: To each 200 μL diluted sample was added 100 μL of a 2.5 wt% phenyl isothiocyanate acetonitrile solution and 100 μL of a 1 M NEt3 acetonitrile solution. The resulting mixture was kept at room temperature for 1 h, then 600 μL of hexane was used to extract the unreacted phenyl isothiocyanate. 200 μL of the bottom layer (acetonitrile) was added to 800 μL of water and filtered for HPLC analysis. Analysis of the quenched L-glutamate samples was done on a Shimadzu Prominence 20 HPLC system, equipped with a C18 column and a UV-Vis detector.
Results and discussion
Catalyst screening
Initially, we screened the Ru terpyridyl complexes 1–7 under visible light irradiation (40 W, 456 nm or 525 nm). As shown in Fig. 1, complex 1 catalyzed the reduction of NAD+ in a sodium formate aqueous solution with a TOF of 7 h−1, which was much higher than that obtained using 15% w/v TEOA (TOF = 2 h−1) or NEt3.18a Similar results were obtained when using 2 and 3. Substitution of a bipyridine ligand at the 4 and the 4′ positions with an electron donating or electron withdrawing group did not improve the photocatalytic activities of 4 and 5. The 6,6′-dimethyl bipyridyl Ru complex 6 gave an improved TOF of 18 h−1. This can attributed to the high ligand substitution rate induced by the large steric hindrance of the 6,6′-dimethyl bipyridine ligand.19a To our delight, the bisquinoline-containing complex 7 efficiently catalyzed the reduction of NAD+ with a TOF of 78 h−1 under irradiation with green light (40 W LEDs, 525 nm). This performance is comparable with the transfer hydrogenation of NAD+ catalyzed by M (TOF = 80 h−1). Moreover, the bisquinoline ligand enhances the electron delocalization and causes a red shift of the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) absorption band (e.g. λMLCT of 1 = 473 nm, λMLCT of 7 = 548 nm, Fig. S55–S56†). Under illumination with red light (40 W, 625 nm), 7 can also catalyze the reduction of NAD+ with a TOF of 39 h−1. The quantum yields (Φ = mol of product per mol of absorbed photon) of NADH in the presence of 1 and 7 were measured through ferrioxalate (for the 456 nm LEDs) and Reinecke's salt actinometry (for the 525 nm LEDs).20 In the presence of 7, the quantum yield was one order higher than that obtained in the presence of 1 (7.9 × 10−3vs. 3.6 × 10−4, see ESI, page 5†). Unlike 1, 7 could not catalyze the reduction of NAD+ using TEOA as the reductant, which implied that the ability to undergo rapid ligand exchange, rather than the photoredox properties of 7, was the key for this conversion.
 Fig. 1  The screening of photocatalysts (10 μM) for the transfer hydrogenation of NAD+ (1 mM) in the presence of HCOONa (0.5 M). For photocatalysts 1–7, 40 W LEDs (456 nm for 1–6 and 525 nm for 7) were used with a fan at room temperature; for M, the reactions were carried out at 40 °C. Black and gray bars represent the results with and without 1 mM glutathione (GSH). 
To confirm that the NADH regeneration was a light-driven process, control experiments under alternating dark and light conditions were carried out. As a result, negligible NADH was formed without illumination (upon raising the temperature to 45 °C no NADH was detected) whereas the concentration of NADH increased linearly with a TOF of 159 h−1 under the irradiation of a 100 W green LED. After 100 min of irradiation, 93 mol% of the NAD+ had been converted to NADH with a concentration of 1.86 mM (Fig. 2a). Moreover, only 10 μM of 7 is employed in this photocatalytic system whereas, when M is used as the electron mediator 250 μM of M is required.

Besides NADH, NADPH and BNAH were also regenerated with high TOFs of 190 h−1 and 90 h−1, respectively. To prove that the regeneration of NADH with 7 is enzymatically useful, glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) was employed in the light-driven NADH regeneration system to synthesize L-glutamate from α-ketoglutarate (see ESI, page 7†). As shown in Fig. 2b, the yield of L-glutamate could be controlled by irradiation with green light. A TOF of 161 h−1 was achieved after 0.5 h of irradiation, indicating that no significant deactivation of the photocatalyst occurred in the presence of GDH. After 1.5 h of irradiation, 10 mM of α-ketoglutarate was completely converted to L-glutamate and then another 10 mM of α-ketoglutarate was added and converted within another 1 h. TONs based on 7 and NAD+ were 380 and 19, respectively. In earlier works,4a,7a the regeneration of NAD(P)+ has been examined. TONs of NAD(P)+ over 40 were achieved, however enzymes or proteins needed to be used to regenerate the NAD(P)+. Additionally, other recent works10,11 have been devoted to the discovery of novel photosensitizers but the TONs based on NAD(P)+ were low. In this work, a moderate TON of NAD(P)+ was achieved using a bifunctional photocatalyst which plays the role of both photosensitizer and mediator.
Tolerance to amino acid residues and light-induced ligand exchange
With complex 7 in hand, we tested its tolerance towards amino acid residues. 7 maintained at least 86% of its catalytic activity in the presence of bovine serum albumin, alcohol dehydrogenase, glutathione and mercaptoethanol (Fig. S1†). In stark contrast, M lost most of its activity (TOF decreased from 80 h−1 to 3 h−1) in the presence of glutathione (Fig. 1).
It is reasonable to attribute the good tolerance and high efficiency of 7 to the dissociative character of the triplet metal centered (3MC) excited state which is generated from the MLCT excited states.19 To this end, we tested the formation of [Ru(tpy)(biq)HCOO]+ (7a) from 7via ligand exchange with a formate anion. In water, 7 readily released its chloride ligand forming the cations [Ru(tpy)(biq)OH]+ and [Ru(tpy)(biq)]2+ which was then confirmed by 1H NMR (Fig. S28†)19c and HRMS ((ESI-TOF) m/z: [Ru(tpy)(biq)OH]+ calcd for C33H24N5ORu+ 608.1059; found 608.1019; [Ru(tpy)(biq)]2+ calcd for C33H23N5Ru2+ 295.5508; found 295.5493). Similarly, [Ru(tpy)(biq)Cl]+ generated [Ru(tpy)(biq)MeCN]2+ in MeCN. The two cationic structures were well defined by (single crystal) SC-XRD (Fig. S58 and S59†). Compared to the spontaneous substitution of chloride with solvents in the ground state, the fast replacement of solvents by formate requires irradiation to generated excited states. The electronic absorption spectra of 7 in sodium formate solution after irradiation showed a shift of the MLCT band from 553 nm to 559 nm and a rise in the absorption at 625 nm, which is indicative that photosubstitution occurred at the Ru center (Fig. 3a). 7a was observed in the irradiated solution by HRMS ((ESI-TOF) m/z: [Ru(tpy)(biq)HCOO]+ calcd for C34H24N5O2Ru+ 636.0993; found 636.0968). Irradiation of [Ru(tpy)(biq)MeCN]2+ also afforded 7a whose molecular structure was characterized by 1H NMR and SC-XRD (Fig. S26, S27 and S60†). The rate constant (k) for the photosubstitution of 7 in 0.5 M sodium formate solution was determined to be 0.034 s−1, corresponding to a quantum yield of 1.2 × 10−2 (Fig. 3b).

Reaction kinetics and mechanism
The rate constant of the formate ligand exchange linearly increased as the concentration of sodium formate increased, suggesting that the photo-induced ligand exchange followed first-order reaction kinetics (Fig. S2†).
The kinetics of the photocatalytic reduction of NAD+ were investigated at different concentrations of sodium formate and NAD+. As shown in Fig. 4a and b, the TOFs of NADH display a linear relationship with formate concentration and they were not affected by the concentration of NAD+. The above observations indicate that the photoreduction of NAD+ is a pseudo first-order reaction and the final hydride transfer to NAD+ is a fast step. This is consistent with a mechanism that involves a light-driven ligand exchange of complex 7 and with the reported fast hydride transfer from a terpyridyl ruthenium hydride complex to BNA+.18 To verify that the transfer hydrogenation occurs via the Ru-hydride species [Ru(tpy)(biq)H]+ (7b), the reaction of 10 mM of BNA+ and 10 mM of 7b in MeCN-d3 was followed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Within 5 min, 7b was completely consumed by the BNA+, giving BNAH as the product (Fig. S41†). This result also suggests that the hydride transfer to NAD+ is a fast step.
 Fig. 4  (a) TOF of NADH as a function of HCOONa concentration; (b) a plot of TOF of NADH vs. concentration of NAD+. 
The primary kinetic isotope effect (KIE = kH/kD = 2.5) was measured in parallel experiments using HCOONa (TOF = 159 h−1) and DCOONa (TOF = 64 h−1, the same conditions as Fig. 2a but using DCOONa instead). Thus, the rate-determining step of this photoreaction should involve either C–H bond cleavage (decarboxylation) or Ru–H bond cleavage (hydride transfer).21 Given that the concentration of NAD+ did not affect the reaction rate, the concerted decarboxylation and hydride transfer to NAD+ could be excluded. It is reasonable to conclude that the decarboxylation of 7a is the rate-determining step since hydride transfer is much faster. Based on the above observations, a plausible mechanism for the reaction is given in Scheme 2. Using Ru(tpy)(bpy)(MeCN)(PF6)2, Ru(tpy)(bpy)(HCOO)PF6 and Ru(tpy)(bpy)(H)PF6 as the photocatalysts for the reaction, the regeneration of NADH was successfully achieved, consistent with the proposed catalytic cycle. Further strong evidence supporting this mechanism was the reaction of BNA+ with DCOONa (Scheme 3). According to the NMR results (Fig. S41†), deuterated 1,4-BNAH was obtained as main product. This indicated that, unlike widely used amines, formate acted as a hydride donor instead of an electron donor, 7 was converted to a hydride to form 7b and finally BNA+ received the hydride from 7b. It should be noted that in the reaction involving 7 and formate the step to generate the key intermediate ruthenium hydrides was different from that when using 1 and amines.18

With the rate-determining step in mind, we wondered whether the transformation of 7a to 7b was a light-driven process like the formation of a cobalt hydride complex via β-hydride elimination22 or a thermal reaction like the generation of [RhCp*(bpy)H]+. In this regard, decarboxylation of the Ru(tpy)(biq)(HCOO)PF6 complex was conducted in sealed NMR tubes in both the light and the dark. However, at high field no hydride signal was observed in the 1H NMR spectrum. The reason that 7b was not observed is probably because a low concentration of the hydride species, that is undetectable, is formed through a thermal dynamic equilibrium with a small equilibrium constant. To verify the hypothesis, BNA+ was employed as a hydride acceptor to drive the equilibrium toward the 7b side. As a result, BNAH was afforded when the reaction was conducted in the dark, suggesting that the rate-determining decarboxylation of 7a was a thermal reaction (Fig. S41†). Furthermore, the apparent activation energy of this step, as estimated via photocatalytic experiments carried out at different temperatures, was only 3.2 ± 0.4 kcal mol−1 (Fig. S3†).
Thermodynamic hydricity of 7b
Thermodynamic hydricity is a crucial parameter to evaluate the hydride donating ability of metal and organic hydride donors.23 After it was reported that [Ru(tpy)(bpy)H]+ (1b) could mediate photocatalytic reductions,18 Creutz et al.24 carefully measured its hydricity in MeCN and water. To the best of our knowledge, the hydricity of 7b was still unknown since its structure had been not reported before. To understand the thermodynamics of this visible-light-driven transfer hydrogenation, the hydricity of 7b was measured in MeCN. Thanks to the previous works devoted to the measurement of the hydricities of metal hydrides and organic hydride donors, we could estimate the value through a thermodynamic equilibrium. As shown in Fig. S42–S43,† a mixture of Ru(tpy)(bpy)(H)PF6 and Ru(tpy)(biq)(MeCN)(PF6)2 generated 7b after 21 h at 298 K. This was determined by the appearance of a new peak at −14.71 ppm and the decrease of the peak at −14.69 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum. However, a mixture of Ru(tpy)(biq)(H)PF6 and Ru(tpy)(bpy)(MeCN)PF6 did not afford 1b (Fig. S44†). Although equilibrium of the two mixtures was not reached due to the decomposition of the hydride species, these observations revealed that 7b had a lower hydride donating ability than that of 1b (i.e. hydricity7b > hydricity1b). Thermodynamic equilibrium was successfully achieved using Ru(tpy)(biq)(H)PF6 and 1,3-dimethylpyridinium hexafluorophosphate (DMPY) in MeCN-d3, forming 1,4-dihydrodimethylpyridine (1,4-DHDMPY) as well as 1,6-dihydrodimethylpyridine (1,6-DHDMPY) as a minor product. After 48 h at 298 K, an equilibrium constant of 4.3 was estimated by integration of the 1H NMR spectra. This remained unchanged for the following 5 days (Fig. S45–S50†) and corresponded to a Gibbs free energy change of −0.9 kcal mol−1. The reported hydricity of 1,4-DHDMPY is 41 ± 3 kcal mol−1.24a [Note: the value was also reported as 50.3 kcal mol−1 elsewhere.25] As shown in Scheme 4, the hydricity of 7b in MeCN was calculated as 40 ± 3 kcal mol−1 by summation of the Gibbs free energy change and the hydricity of 1,4-DHDMPY. The value is 1 kcal mol−1 higher than that of 1b (39 ± 3 kcal mol−1), which is in good agreement with the earlier observation of hydride transfer from 1b to [Ru(tpy)(biq)MeCN]2+. Given the hypothesis that the relative differences in hydricity between 1b and 7b are identical in water and MeCN (Δhydricity7b–1b,water = Δhydricity7b–1b,MeCN), the hydricity of 7b in water could be estimated as 23.6 kcal mol−1 (hydricity7b,water = hydricity1b,water + Δhydricity7b–1b,MeCN = 22.6 + 1 kcal mol−1). The thermodynamic equilibrium constant for the reversible decarboxylation of [Ru(tpy)(bpy)HCOO]+ (1a) to 1b in water was reported as 5.9 × 10−10 which corresponds to a Gibbs free energy change (ΔG1a–1b,water = hydricity1a,water – hydricity1b,water) of 12.5 kcal mol−1.24b Another hypothesis assumes that the hydricities of ruthenium formates 1a and 7a are close (hydricity1a,water = hydricity7a,water ≈ hydricityformate,water) and therefore, a Gibbs free energy change of 11.5 kcal mol−1 is obtained for the decarboxylation of 7a (ΔG7a–7b,water = hydricity7a,water – hydricity7b,water = ΔG1a–1b,water – Δhydricity1b–7a,MeCN = 12.5–1 kcal mol−1), corresponding to an equilibrium constant of 3.4 × 10−9. The relatively high equilibrium constant of 1a when compared to that of (1b) favors the formation of 7b and therefore enhances the efficiency of the regeneration of the nicotinamide cofactors.

Conclusions
In summary, we developed a visible-light-driven transfer hydrogenation protocol for the regeneration of nicotinamide cofactors. In the presence of low concentrations of photocatalyst 7, efficient reduction of NAD+ was achieved with a TOF of 159 h−1 and a quantum yield of 7.9 × 10−3. Compared to the conventional transfer hydrogenation of NAD+ using M, the light-driven protocol enables a reduction of cofactors that is more efficient, that offers greater control and that is tolerant to amino acid residues, especially to thiol groups. In principle, these advantages render the photocatalytic regeneration of nicotinamide cofactors compatible with enzymes or whole cells. The controllable and efficient synthesis of L-glutamate has been realized in the presence of 7 and GDH. Note that the reaction mechanism is different from the photoredox regeneration of BNA+ using 1 and amines. Kinetic studies showed that a light-driven ligand exchange afforded 7a with a quantum yield of 1.2 × 10−2. Kinetic isotope experiments revealed that the formation of 7b through the decarboxylation of 7a was the rate-determining step with a small apparent activation energy of 3.2 ± 0.4 kcal mol−1. A hydricity of 40 ± 3 kcal mol−1 for 7b and a thermodynamic equilibrium constant of 3.4 × 10−9 for the decarboxylation of 7a to 7b were estimated. Using this powerful protocol, the reductions of more unsaturated substrates using NAD(P)H dependent enzymes are underway in our lab.
