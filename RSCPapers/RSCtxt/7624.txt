    , Accepted 13th October 2022First published on 13th October 2022AbstractBismuth telluride (Bi2Te3) and its derivatives are often focused on as thermoelectric materials around room temperature. In this work, we theoretically predicted two new types of Bi2Te3-based two-dimensional materials Bi2SSe2 and Bi2S2Se using density functional theory (DFT) combined with Boltzmann transport theory. The thermal, dynamic, and mechanical stabilities of Bi2SSe2 and Bi2S2Se monolayers are confirmed using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, phonon dispersion, and elastic constant calculations. The phonon transport properties, including lattice thermal conductivity, group velocity, Grüneisen parameter, converged scattering rate, and phonon lifetimes contributed by different branches, are systematically investigated. The electronic and thermoelectric properties, including carrier mobility (μ), Seebeck coefficient (S), electrical conductivity (σ), power factors, and figure of merit (zT) along the zigzag and armchair directions as a function of carrier concentration at different temperatures, are also investigated. It is found that the Bi2SSe2 and Bi2S2Se monolayers have moderate indirect band gaps (0.92 eV and 1.08 eV at the PBE level, respectively) and low lattice thermal conductivities (4.35 and 5.37 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K, respectively). The largest zT values of Bi2SSe2 and Bi2S2Se monolayers are 0.50 and 0.28 at 300 K and 1.39 and 0.93 at 700 K for p-doping types, respectively. The Bi2SSe2 and Bi2S2Se monolayers are predicted to show high optical absorption peaks at 8 × 105 cm−1 in the visible and near-UV light region, respectively. Our results indicate that both Bi2SSe2 and Bi2S2Se could be promising candidates in energy conversion, solar cells, and optoelectronic devices.
1. Introduction
Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3 are widely known for their excellent thermoelectric properties like high thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) with high carrier mobility and low lattice thermal conductivity.1–4 Meanwhile, the topological insulating behaviors of Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3, and Sb2Te3 have also become a hot topic in materials research.5,6 It is known that substituting elements with their congeners may give rise to some unique properties, like replacing X atoms with Y atoms in Bi2X3 can form new types of materials Bi2X2Y (X, Y = O, S, Se, and Te; X ≠ Y). For this reason, the Bi2X2Y ternary compound family and its electronic properties are systematically explored,7 and the high thermoelectric performances of Pnma Bi2SeS2–Pnnm Bi2SeS2 have also been found.8
Since graphene was successfully stripped from graphite in 2004,9 lots of two-dimensional (2D) materials with different special electronic, thermodynamic, chemical, and optical properties have been reported, leading to extensive research on 2D materials.10–12 Researchers found that reducing the dimensionality is an effective strategy to optimize the zT values of materials,13,14 and thus the 2D Bi2X3 and Bi2X2Y monolayers have been of interest to researchers.13,15–17 In recent years, the properties, especially the thermal properties, of few-quintuple and single-layer Bi2Te3 and Bi2Se3 have been generally investigated.18–22 Ultrathin semiconducting Bi2O2Se has been successfully synthesized by chemical vapor deposition and shows high electron mobility.23,24 Recently, as one of the promising candidate materials for next-generation electronic devices, the tunneling transport properties of 2D Bi2Se3 have been studied in detail,12 while the Bi2Te2S and Bi2Te2Se monolayers have been theoretically investigated, showing that they have high electron mobilities with zT values of around 0.6 at 300 K.25
With the development of scientific computing technology, a Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB) was built by high-throughput modeling to help researchers to explore new properties of 2D materials.26,27 We noticed that the valence band maxima (VBM) of the Pm1 Bi2X3 and Bi2X2Y compounds are almost not in the high-symmetry path of the Brillouin zone, which may lead to large errors in the calculation of the effective mass of holes and will further affect the results of their carrier mobility, relaxation time, and electrical transport properties.17,27
In this work, we systematically investigated two brand-new 2D materials Pm1 Bi2SSe2 and Bi2S2Se monolayers using density functional theory (DFT) combined with Boltzmann transport theory. We first proved their stabilities and investigated their elastic properties, phonon dispersions, and band structures. The results show that both the monolayers are semiconductors with moderate indirect band gaps. Then we calculated their phonon transport properties and found that both materials have low lattice thermal conductivities. We obtained the positions of the real VBMs and the band structures around the VBMs, which are necessary for the accurate calculations of the direction-dependent effective mass. From the deformation potential (DP) theory,28 more reliable carrier mobility and relaxation time can be obtained. Using the effective mass along the zigzag and armchair directions, the anisotropy of the electrical transport and thermoelectric properties of Bi2SSe2 and Bi2S2Se monolayers was further explored. Due to the high optical absorption exhibited by substances similar to them, we also investigated the optical absorption properties of the Bi2SSe2 and Bi2S2Se monolayers. It was found that both Bi2SSe2 and Bi2S2Se monolayers have high optical absorption in the visible and near-UV light region, suggesting that they can harvest the light energy efficiently.
2. Theoretical method and computational details
Our calculations were performed based on the density functional theory (DFT) method as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).29–32 The projector augmented wave (PAW)33,34 pseudopotentials with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)35,36 were used. The Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional37 and spin–orbit coupling (SOC) were used in the band structure calculations to obtain the accurate band gaps of materials.
The initial structures of the Bi2SSe2 and Bi2S2Se monolayers were constructed from the data presented in the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB).26,27 A vacuum space of more than 20 Å thickness was used in all calculations to avoid unwanted interactions caused by periodicity in the vertical direction. The energy cutoff of the plane wave expansion was set to be 450 eV while a Monkhorst–Pack 15 × 15 × 1 Γ-centred k-mesh was sampled in the Brillouin zone. For the convergence of calculations, an energy threshold of 10−6 eV and a force threshold of 0.01 eV Å−1 were used.
To predict the thermal stabilities of the Bi2SSe2 and Bi2S2Se monolayers, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were performed for each material based on a 4 × 4 × 1 sized supercell at 300 K and 600 K, while the simulation time was 10 ps with a time step of 2 fs, using a NVT ensemble with a Nose–Hoover thermostat. In the AIMD calculations, all of the symmetric restraints were canceled to demonstrate the thermal stability of the monolayers more authentically.
The Boltzmann transport equation for phonons was employed for calculating the phonon transport properties, such as lattice thermal conductivity and phonon lifetime, from the ShengBTE package38 with harmonic (second-order) and anharmonic (third-order) interatomic force constants (IFCs) as the input. The phonon dispersions and the second-order IFCs were obtained with the Phonopy code,22 while the third-order IFCs were obtained with the thirdorder.py code19 in the ShengBTE package by the finite-displacement method. The 4 × 4 × 1 sized supercells with a 5 × 5 × 1 Γ-centred k-mesh were used in these IFC calculations. Besides, the 3rd nearest neighbors were considered to obtain the third-order IFCs. During the phonon transport calculations, a 73 × 73 × 1 q-mesh was chosen to ensure the good convergence of lattice thermal conductivity.
The electrical transport properties, including the Seebeck coefficient (S), electrical conductivity over the relaxation time (σ/τ), and electrical thermal conductivity over the relaxation time (κe/τ), were obtained by using semiclassical Boltzmann theory as implemented in the BoltzTraP2 code with a 50 × 50 × 1 Γ-centred k-mesh.39,40 The carrier mobility μi and relaxation time τi were obtained using deformation potential (DP) theory28,41,42 for 2D materials from:  where C(2D) is the 2D elastic modulus defined as . E1 is the deformation potential defined as , where Eedge is the energy of the VBM/CBM and depends on a slight strain,  defined as  is the effective mass of electrons or holes along the x or y direction, and md defined as  is the direction-averaged effective mass.
Some properties like S, σ, and κe are correlated in that increasing S will inevitably decrease σ, and also, σ and κe have proportional relationships according to the Wiedemann–Franz law.43,44 Therefore, in order to balance these quantities with different trends as the carrier concentration increases, we need a new parameter as a measure of the electrical efficiency of the materials. The power factor (PF) defined as PF = S2σ is a common choice. The most important characteristic of the thermoelements is a quantity denoted by letter z, which is defined using the equation .45 To make z dimensionless, we always use the figure of merit of thermoelectric materials  to describe the maximum efficiency of the energy conversion process.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structures and stabilities
In our work, both the Bi2SSe2 and Bi2S2Se monolayers with a space group of Pm1 (no. 164) consist of five monoatomic sublayers (X–Bi–Y–Bi–X) called the quintuple layer (QL). The fully relaxed structures of the Bi2SSe2 and Bi2S2Se monolayers and their high-symmetry path in the first Brillouin zone46 are illustrated in Fig. 1. The optimized lattice constants a of the Bi2SSe2 and Bi2S2Se monolayers are 4.13 and 4.10 Å, respectively. Our results are close to the experimental value of 4.14 Å for the bulk and nanodisc Bi2Se320,47 and the theoretical result of 4.17 Å for the monolayer Bi2Se3.48 The lattice constants are in the order of aBi2Se3 > aBi2SSe2 > aBi2S2Se, showing that the larger radius of the Se atom will increase the lattice constant.

The red background shows a hexagonal primitive cell in the 4 × 4 × 1 sized supercell and the blue background shows a square cell that denotes the armchair and zigzag directions. 
After structure relaxation, to verify the thermal stability of these monolayers, we performed the AIMD simulations showing that both the Bi2SSe2 and Bi2S2Se monolayers can maintain their original configurations in a narrow range of energy at a temperature up to 600 K, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The phonon dispersions shown in Fig. 2 do not have any imaginary modes of phonon dispersions observed in the high-symmetry path in the first Brillouin zone, suggesting that both the Bi2SSe2 and Bi2S2Se monolayers are dynamically stable.

The calculated elastic stiffness properties are listed in Table 1. It is shown that our results are consistent with those obtained from high-throughput calculations,27 indicating that our calculations are reliable. The elastic constants satisfy the elastic stability criteria for 2D materials,46,49C11 > 0 and C11 > |C12|, showing that both Bi2SSe2 and Bi2S2Se monolayers are mechanically stable. Our results also show that the obtained ratios of the maximum values to minimum values for Young's modulus (E), shear modulus (S), and Poisson's ratio (v) of the Bi2SSe2 and Bi2S2Se monolayers are equal to 1.0, respectively, which means that these elastic properties are all isotropic.

The spatial distribution of the valence electrons can often exhibit some characteristics of chemical bonds, and this can be visualized using the electron localization function (ELF). Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows that the ELF in a small area at the center of the Bi atoms is close to 1, while around the Bi atoms it is about 0.5, and the ELF at the center of the S/Se atoms is about 0.5, while ELF around them is close to 1. Moreover, it can be seen that there are covalent bonds formed by sharing of electrons between the Bi and edge atoms. Our results are similar to those of the past studies on Bi2Se3.50
3.2 Electronic properties
It is well-known that the band structure calculated at the PBE level has a high probability of underestimating the band gap when compared to the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid functional calculations,37 while the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effect should be considered for heavy atoms.51 Thus, the electronic band structures of the Bi2SSe2 and Bi2S2Se monolayers with different density functionals were calculated to compare their band gaps, as shown in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  Electronic band structures and the band gaps of (a) Bi2SSe2 and (b) Bi2S2Se monolayers with PBE (orange line), PBE + SOC (blue line), HSE (green line), and HSE + SOC (red line) density functionals, respectively. 
At the PBE level, the Bi2SSe2 and Bi2S2Se monolayers have band gaps of 0.92 eV and 1.08 eV, respectively. After considering the SOC effect, the band gaps reduce to 0.55 eV and 0.66 eV, respectively. At the HSE06 level, the band gaps are enlarged to 1.48 eV and 1.68 eV, respectively, and decreased to 1.01 eV and 1.17 eV, respectively, after considering the SOC effect. The results show that both Bi2SSe2 and Bi2S2Se monolayers are semiconducting and have indirect band gaps. The band gaps are larger than those of 2D Bi2Te3 (0.57 eV at HSE06)52 and Bi2Se3 (1.42 eV at HSE06).53
As shown in Fig. 3, the band structures obtained from the calculations of different density functionals are very close to each other, and only the band gaps are different, while the PBE calculations can be a good approximation to the high-precision and time-consuming HSE06 + SOC calculations. For this reason, subsequent calculations are almost carried out with the PBE density functionals.
To show more details of the electronic properties, the obtained projected band structures at the PBE level of the Bi2SSe2 and Bi2S2Se monolayers are illustrated in Fig. 4. Our calculations show that both the conduction band minima (CBM) of two materials are located at the Γ point, while the valence band maxima (VBM) seem to be located in the Γ–M path for Bi2SSe2 and the Γ–K path for Bi2S2Se. But actually, the true location of VBMs in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) deviates away from the high-symmetry path but can be located by 3D-band calculation covering the entire first Brillouin zone of the materials, as shown in Fig. 5. Moreover, because the energy values of the true VBM are only 6.1 meV and 10.4 meV higher than those of the local maxima in the high-symmetry line for Bi2SSe2 and Bi2S2Se, respectively, we can normally just use the energy value in the high-symmetry line as a good approximation in other calculations, except the effective mass calculations. The calculation results also show that the CBMs of both materials are mainly contributed by the p-orbitals of Bi atoms, while the VBMs are mainly contributed by the p-orbitals of the more abundant atoms between S and Se atoms.

3.3 Phonon transport properties
The lattice thermal conductivity κlat plays an important role in the phonon transport properties of materials. For 2D materials, thickness is a necessary parameter for the calculation of κlat. The calculated κlat should be rescaled by multiplying with zcell/zeff, where zcell is the length of the primitive cell along the z direction and zeff is the effective thickness of the 2D materials.54 To define the effective thickness of 2D materials, the summation of the monolayer thickness and the vdW radii55 of the outermost surface atoms was performed, which results in 10.657 Å (= 6.857 Å + 1.9 Å × 2) and 10.399 Å (= 6.799 Å + 1.8 Å × 2) for the Bi2SSe2 and Bi2S2Se monolayers, respectively. In Fig. 6, we have plotted the rescaled lattice thermal conductivity as a function of temperature based on the iterative approach of the phonon Boltzmann transport equation. It is seen from Fig. 6 that κlat of Bi2SSe2 is always smaller than that of Bi2S2Se, which may be due to the heavier atomic mass of the Se atom than that of the S atom. At 300 K, the rescaled lattice thermal conductivities of the Bi2SSe2 and Bi2S2Se monolayers are 4.35 and 5.37 W m−1 K−1, respectively, which are significantly lower than those of graphene (2200 W m−1 K−1),56 MoSe2 (70 W m−1 K−1) and WSe2 (42 W m−1 K−1),57 and close to that of the SnS monolayer (4.7 W·m−1 K−1),58 indicating that our materials satisfy the initial requirements for using them as thermoelectric materials.
 Fig. 6  Rescaled lattice thermal conductivities of Bi2SSe2 (red line) and Bi2S2Se (blue line) monolayers. 
In order to explore the phonon transport properties of the two substances more clearly, we further studied the contribution of the branches composed of the out-of-plane mode (ZA), the in-plane transverse mode (TA), the in-plane longitudinal mode (LA), and the sum of all optical modes to the total lattice thermal conductivity. The results at 300 K are listed in Table 2. It can be found that for both Bi2SSe2 and Bi2S2Se monolayers, the LA branch plays a dominant role, while the sums of the contributions of all optical branches are less than 20%. Compared with Bi2S2Se, the lattice thermal conductivity of Bi2SSe2 contributed by the ZA branch is reduced from 1.34 to 0.46 W m−1 K−1, which is the main reason why the lattice thermal conductivity of Bi2S2Se is smaller than that of Bi2SSe2.

To understand in depth the principles, the group velocity, Grüneisen parameter, converged scattering rate and phonon lifetime as a function of phonon frequency for two 2D materials at 300 K are shown in Fig. 7. For acoustic branches, the maximum group velocities of the Bi2SSe2 and Bi2S2Se monolayers are 3.35 and 4.03 km s−1, respectively. For the optical branches, the maximum group velocities of the Bi2SSe2 and Bi2S2Se monolayers are 4.52 and 4.20 km s−1, respectively. The magnitude relationships of group velocities are consistent with the magnitude relationships of lattice thermal conductivities as shown in Table 2. However, the group velocity reflects only part of the relationship between thermal conductivity and the contribution of each phonon branch. The influence of the phonon–phonon scattering process on the lattice thermal conductivity can be more intuitively studied using the phonon lifetime and Grüneisen parameter. From the partial enlarged view of the phonon lifetime shown in Fig. 7(d) in the range of 0–1 THz of the phonon frequency, it can be found that in the low-frequency range, the phonon lifetime of the ZA branch (red dots) of Bi2SSe2 is significantly lower than that of Bi2S2Se. A longer phonon lifetime corresponds to a higher lattice thermal conductivity, this should be the reason why its ZA branch contributes less to the lattice thermal conductivity, and this further leads to a smaller total lattice thermal conductivity of Bi2SSe2.

Furthermore, to explore the effect of the device size on the material properties, the cumulative lattice thermal conductivities of the two materials as a function of the max phonon mean free path (MFP) are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The results show that reducing the sample size below 4500 nm will effectively reduce the lattice thermal conductivity of these materials so that the materials can attain more suitable properties for more application scenarios (such as thermoelectric materials). Our results are fitted to the functions of ,38 and the fitting results are included as a dashed curve in Fig. S3 (ESI†). As a representative parameter of the mean free path, the x0 values of Bi2SSe2 and Bi2S2Se monolayers are 155 nm and 285 nm, respectively, which are smaller than those of stanene (2710 nm)59 and InAs (310 nm)38 but larger than those of SnS2 (67.7 nm)60 and Se2Te (39.7 nm).61 These values can be used as the effective reference for size tuning.
3.4 Electrical transport properties
For semiconductors, the carrier mobility μ is a key parameter of their electrical transport properties and a relative measure for their application scenarios in efficient electronic power devices. Therefore, it is necessary to accurately estimate the carrier mobilities of these two semiconducting monolayers. Based on the DP theory, the elastic constant  is obtained with the VASPKIT code,62 where E is the total energy after applying uniaxial strain (Δl/l0) from −1.5% to +1.5% and S0 is the bottom area of materials at equilibrium. The deformation potentials E1 and effective masses  are obtained by fitting a linear function and a parabolic function, respectively. Both the original data and the fitted functions of E1 and  are shown in Fig. S4 and S5 (ESI†). All the calculated parameters related to carrier mobility are shown in Table 3.

With the obtained E1, C(2D) and m*, it can be found that only the effective mass of holes shows obvious anisotropy between the armchair and zigzag directions; therefore we calculated the angular-dependent effective masses of the Bi2SSe2 and Bi2S2Se monolayers in the square cells as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The elastic moduli C(2D) are in the order of CBi2Se3 < CBi2SSe2 < CBi2S2Se, which is mainly caused by the heavier mass of the Se atom because as Se atoms are larger than the S atoms, the bonding electrons will occupy a proportionally smaller region between atoms and make Bi–Se bonds weaker than Bi–S bonds.
Combining the relaxation time obtained using DP theory and the rescaled lattice thermal conductivity obtained using the ShengBTE package with the data obtained from BoltzTraP2, we can obtain the variations of S, σ, κe, PF, and zT as a function of carrier concentration at different temperatures. Fig. 8 shows these calculated values of the Bi2SSe2 and Bi2S2Se monolayers along the zigzag and armchair directions at 300 K, 500 K, and 700 K for the p-doping type (hole) and n-doping type (electron) cases. It is noted that to achieve the max zT value, a much higher carrier concentration is needed for the p-doping type than for the n-doping type. For the p-doping type, all σ, κe, PF and zT are higher along the armchair direction than along the zigzag direction, and higher in the Bi2SSe2 monolayer than in the Bi2S2Se monolayer.

For the Bi2SSe2 monolayer, the max zT value at 300 K is about 0.50 along the armchair direction when the carrier concentration of holes is about 5.4 × 1013 cm−2 and the max zT value can increase to 1.39 at 700 K along the armchair direction. For the Bi2S2Se monolayer, the max zT value at 300 K is about 0.28 along the armchair direction when the carrier concentration of holes is about 6.2 × 1013 cm−2 and the max zT value can increase to 0.92 at 700 K along the armchair direction. The zT values of Bi2SSe2 are similar to those of the typical thermoelectric material Pnma-SnSe,63 and are 0.32 at 323 K and 1.62 at 723 K, suggesting that Bi2SSe2 is a promising thermoelectric material.
3.5 Optical properties
Both Bi2Se3 and Bi2SSeTe monolayers having the same structure as our materials showed high optical absorption in past research,46,53 which made us very curious about the optical properties of the Bi2SSe2 and Bi2S2Se monolayers. For bulk materials, the optical absorption is always estimated using the formula , where ω is the photon frequency and ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) are extracted from the dielectric function ε(ω) = ε1(ω) + iε2(ω). However, the dielectric function is not well-defined for 2D materials and will be affected by the distance of the vacuum space for 2D material calculations. To avoid this point, the optical conductivity defined as σ2D(ω) = Lσ3D(ω) is suggested to characterize the optical properties of 2D materials,62 where σ3D(ω) = i[1 − ε(ω)]ε0ω and L is the layer thickness of the monolayer. In general, the optical reflectivity of 2D materials is so small that the optical absorption can be estimated using the formula A(ω) = Re(σ2D(ω)/ε0c), In our work, both the formulas are considered.
As shown in Fig. 9, the trends presented by the two methods are similar, which proves that the optical absorption formula for 2D materials is effective. The absorption spectra at the HSE06 level are similar to those at the PBE level, but the energy is larger, which should be due to the larger band gap of HSE06 calculations as shown in Fig. 3. For the first formula α(ω), the first absorption peaks of both materials appear at 3.0 eV at the PBE level and at 3.7 eV at the HSE06 level in the order of 8 × 105 cm−1. For the second formula A(ω), the first absorption peaks of Bi2SSe2 (Bi2S2Se) monolayers appear at 2.8 eV (2.6–2.9 eV) at the PBE level and at 3.5 eV (3.3 eV) at the HSE06 level. Furthermore, for comparison, the absorption spectrum of the Bi2Se3 monolayer is shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†).
 Fig. 9  Calculated (a and c) traditional absorption spectra and (b and d) 2D absorption spectra of the Bi2SSe2 and Bi2S2Se monolayers at the PBE level (red lines) and HSE06 level (blue lines), respectively. The simulated colors of the visible light are shown in the corresponding energy regions in the figure. 
All the results show that both Bi2SSe2 and Bi2S2Se monolayers have high optical absorption in the visible and near-UV light region, which is comparable to those of GaAs (2.5 × 105 cm−1) and CH3NH3PbI3 (3 × 105 cm−1),64 and are the ultrahigh conversion efficiency absorbers for the thin-film solar cells and the much-anticipated absorbers for solar cells. The optical absorption of monolayer Bi2SSe2 is a little larger than that of monolayer Bi2S2Se, which reveals the potential of the Bi2SSe2 monolayer as an efficient optical-absorbing material.
4. Conclusions
In summary, using density functional theory together with Boltzmann transport theory, we have theoretically predicted that the Bi2SSe2 and Bi2S2Se monolayers are thermally, dynamically, and mechanically stable. We systematically explored the transport and optical properties of the Bi2SSe2 and Bi2S2Se monolayers, including their elastic stiffness properties, phonon dispersion, carrier mobility, electron and lattice thermal conductivities, and optical absorption. The band structures were calculated and compared for the PBE and HSE06 functionals with and without spin–orbit coupling. Our results indicate that both Bi2SSe2 and Bi2S2Se monolayers have relatively low lattice thermal conductivities (4.35 and 5.37 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K). The Bi2SSe2 monolayer has a lower lattice thermal conductivity due to its shorter phonon lifetime of the ZA branch, which further results in higher zT values (0.5 at 300 K and 1.39 at 700 K). Meanwhile, both materials show high optical-absorption properties and thus could be promising candidates in the field of optical-absorbing materials. We hope that this study will be helpful for further theoretical and experimental research on bulk and low-dimensional Bi-based materials after our work.
