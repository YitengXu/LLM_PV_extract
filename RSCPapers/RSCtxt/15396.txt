Fe2O3@GNS exhibits excellent cycling performance and rate capability.
In the past decades, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), due to the high energy densities, have become a dominant power source in portable electronics and have found applications in transportation, such as in hybrid electrical vehicles (HEVs) and electrical vehicles (EVs). Particularly, they have become indispensable energy storage devices for intermittent energy conversions, like in solar cells and wind power.1,2 However, lithium resources are too limited to meet the increasing demand of the global market for LIBs. Large-scale applications of LIBs are challenging in terms of their availability and cost. The development of new types of batteries, such as sodium-ion and magnesium-ion batteries, is necessary. Among them, sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) possess electrochemical working principles that are similar to LIBs. In addition, sodium is both inexpensive and abundant. Sodium is the sixth richest element on earth. Therefore, NIBs could substitute LIBs in applications such as smart grids and large-scale energy storage for renewable solar power and wind power.
NIBs have attracted tremendous attention because of their potential low cost. Numerous materials have been investigated as electrodes for NIBs, such as Na4Co3(PO4)2P2O7,3 Na3V2(PO4)3,4,5 red phosphorus,6 SnSb,7 Sb,8,9 TiO210 and MoO3.11 Iron-based materials have promising sustainability and environmental safety for both LIBs and NIBs. Iron, the fourth richest element in the earth's crust, is inexpensive. Therefore, these materials have the potential as cost-effective future energy storage systems. Iron-based materials (i.e., NaxFe1/2Mn1/2O2,12 Fe3O4,13,14 and Fe2O314,15) have been used as cathodes and anodes of NIBs. Improving the performance of this series of iron-based materials is extremely important for the development of NIBs.
Recently, transition metal oxides (e.g., SnO216,17 and MoO311) that were previously applied as high-capacity anodes in LIBs have been extended to NIBs. Transition metal oxides have exhibited high capacity and good cycling performance. In addition, they are also promising anode candidates in NIBs for large-scale energy storage. However, large-volume expansion/contraction associated with alkaline ion insertion–extraction is known to generate tremendous microstructural damage to electrodes, which leads to loss of electrical contact and subsequently rapid capacity fading.18 Anchoring Fe2O3 nanoparticles onto carbon matrices can effectively cushion the volume expansion/contraction. Graphene has been used successfully as a carbon matrix because of its superior conductivity, large surface area, and excellent mechanical flexibility.19 In this study, Fe2O3 nanocrystals uniformly anchored onto graphene nanosheets (Fe2O3@GNS) were obtained via the nanocasting technique and studied as the anode material of NIBs. Graphene functioned as both a supporter and a conductive additive. No additional conductive reagents were used in the Fe2O3@GNS electrode. The good contact between Fe2O3 nanocrystals and GNS and the flexibility of GNS were expected to improve the cycling performance and rate capability of NIBs. The corresponding electrochemical performance of the NIB with Fe2O3@GNS was evaluated.
Graphite oxide (GO) was synthesized from natural graphite powders by a modified Hummers method.20 GNS was prepared through thermal exfoliation splitting of GO.21 GNS prepared by the thermal exfoliation method has numerous pores, which provide space for the nanoparticles. Therefore, nanocasting technology can be used to prepare Fe2O3@GNS.19 The details of the experiment are separately described in the ESI.†
After anchoring Fe2O3, a hump located at around 34° turns up, which is ascribed to the peaks of Fe2O3 and is visible in the XRD pattern of Fe2O3@GNS, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Fig. 1a shows the Raman spectra of the pristine GNS, Fe2O3, and Fe2O3@GNS. The D-band located at 1324 cm−1 and the G-band at 1596 cm−1 are characteristic Raman shifts of graphite,22 which can be observed in both GNS and Fe2O3@GNS. In addition, three Raman shifts below 500 cm−1 in Fe2O3@GNS are also visible, which correspond to A1g (219 cm−1) and two Eg (284, 400 cm−1) Raman modes of Fe2O3.23 These results confirm the co-existence of Fe2O3 and GNS in Fe2O3@GNS. The largely reduced intensities of Raman modes in Fe2O3@GNS can be attributed to the coverage of the Fe2O3 nanocrystals on GNS. The valence state of iron in Fe2O3@GNS is further examined by Mössbauer spectroscopy, which has been extensively applied on iron-based materials.24Fig. 1b shows the room temperature Mössbauer spectrum of Fe2O3@GNS. There is a broad doublet spectrum of a non-Lorentzian shape, corresponding to a quadrupole splitting distribution, and it can be assigned to Fe2O3.24 The GNS content in Fe2O3@GNS is estimated by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) to be 37.4 wt% in an O2 flow (Fig. S2 in ESI†).

The distribution and microstructure of Fe2O3 in the Fe2O3@GNS nanocomposite were analysed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows the SEM image of the pristine GNS, in which the GNS exhibits a typical two-dimensional nanoflake-like morphology. With Fe2O3 nanocrystals anchored onto GNS by the nanocasting technique, the typical two-dimensional morphology of GNS is sustained in Fe2O3@GNS, as shown in Fig. 2a. The specific surface area of Fe2O3@GNS significantly decreases from 619 m2 g−1 for GNS to 235 m2 g−1, and the pore volume decreases from 2.64 cm3 g−1 for GNS to 0.36 cm3 g−1. The aforementioned results are obtained from the N2 adsorption isotherms shown in Fig. 2b by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method and indicate that the pores of GNS are filled by Fe2O3 nanocrystals. Fig. 2c shows the STEM image of Fe2O3@GNS, in which the Fe2O3 nanocrystals can be observed which are uniformly deposited on GNS. The high resolution STEM image of Fe2O3@GNS is shown in Fig. 2d. The particle size is about 2 nm, further confirmed by the high magnification STEM image in Fig. S4 (ESI†), which is in agreement with the broadened, weak XRD diffraction peaks shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The well-crystallized Fe2O3 nanocrystals can be observed. The d-spacing values of 0.27, 0.25, and 0.22 nm can be assigned to the facets of (104), (110), and (113) of Fe2O3, respectively. These results indicate that Fe2O3 nanocrystals can be uniformly dispersed on GNS.

The as-obtained Fe2O3@GNS was used as anode for NIBs. For reference, the electrode mixture of Fe2O3 and GNS (Fe2O3–GNS) with the same ratio as Fe2O3@GNS was also prepared. No additional conductive reagents were used in both cases. The batteries were constructed as described in the ESI.†
The Na-ion insertion–extraction behavior of Fe2O3@GNS was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic discharge–charge cycling performance. Fig. 3a shows the first five CV curves of the Fe2O3@GNS electrode. The current in the first cathodic scan starting from 0.6 V vs. Na+/Na was higher than those of the subsequent scans, which is attributed to the irreversible formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI). Excluding the first cycle, the subsequent curves almost overlap, suggesting good cycling stability of Fe2O3@GNS. Beyond the first cycle, a couple of weak redox peaks located at 0.6 (cathodic) and 0.7 V (anodic) vs. Na+/Na can be observed, which possibly correspond to the insertion–extraction into/from the crystal structure of Fe2O3. Fig. 3b shows the discharge–charge curves of the first five cycles. The first discharge and charge capacities are about 1103 and 535 mA h g−1, respectively. The corresponding coulombic efficiency is slightly low probably because of the irreversible formation of the SEI on Fe2O3@GNS. Among them, GNS exhibits a high irreversible capacity and a very low reversible capacity (see Fig. S5, ESI†). The average discharge and charge potentials are about 0.4 and 1.2 V, respectively. Thus, Fe2O3@GNS is safe and can avoid the separation of sodium metal in the discharge process. The reversible capacity in the following cycles is almost stable and is maintained at about 410 mA h g−1. The Coulombic efficiency is significantly enhanced, which may be due to the formation of the stable SEI in the first cycle of discharge and charge processes. In the discharge and charge processes, no apparent plateau can be observed, which is possible due to the presence of small nanoparticles of Fe2O3. The reaction can be described as follows:Fe2O3 + 6Na+ + 6e− ↔ 2Fe0 + 3Na2O.
As shown in Fig. 3c, the discharge–charge capacity of Fe2O3@GNS is stabilized beyond the first cycle. The discharge–charge capacity delivered by Fe2O3@GNS reaches 400 mA h g−1 over 200 cycles. No capacity decay can be observed and coulombic efficiencies are close to 100%. The electrode with a mixture of naked Fe2O3 and GNS (Fe2O3–GNS) is also evaluated for comparison. The cycling performance of this electrode is shown in Fig. 3c. Compared with Fe2O3@GNS, Fe2O3–GNS shows higher initial capacity, but has inferior cycling performance. In particular, the discharge–charge capacity declines to 160 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles. The superior Na storage performance of Fe2O3@GNS can be attributed to Fe2O3 nanocrystals being uniformly anchored onto GNS, which can effectively enhance the strain-accommodating capability and prevent pulverization of Fe2O3 upon Na-ion insertion–extraction. Fig. 3d shows the almost identical discharge–charge profiles of Fe2O3@GNS in the selected cycles. These results suggest the stable structure of Fe2O3@GNS during the insertion and extraction of Na+ in the multiple discharge and charge processes.

(c) Cycling performance of the Fe2O3/GNS and Fe2O3@GNS samples at a current of 100 mA g−1, and coulombic efficiency of the Fe2O3@GNS sample. (d) Discharge–charge profiles at selected cycles. (e) Rate capability of the Fe2O3@GNS sample. (f) Cycling performance for Fe2O3@GNS cycled at currents of 200, 500, and 1000 mA g−1. 
The rate capability of Fe2O3@GNS is examined (Fig. 3e). The stable discharge–charge capacity of 400, 350, 260, 190, and 110 mA h g−1 can be delivered at varied currents of 100, 200, 500, 1000, and 2000 mA g−1, respectively. After cycling at high currents, the cell capacity can recover to the original values, which suggests good tolerance at high rate cycling. The superior high rate performance of Fe2O3@GNS is attributed to the small Fe2O3 nanocrystals anchored onto GNS, which can reduce the Na-ion diffusion distance and provide continuous electronic conductive networks. The cycling performance of Fe2O3@GNS at currents of 200, 500, and 1000 mA g−1 is further investigated (see Fig. 3f). All of them exhibit good cycling performance, which further confirms the advantages of the anchored structure. The superior cycling and rate performance can be attributed to the formation of a mixed conducting network and the uniform anchoring of small Fe2O3 nanocrystals on GNS: (1) GNS builds the electron transport path; (2) the small size of the active material Fe2O3 significantly reduces the Na diffusion length; and (3) the active material Fe2O3 anchored onto GNS can effectively enhance the strain-accommodating capability and prevent the pulverization of Fe2O3 upon Na-ion insertion–extraction.
In summary, Fe2O3 nanocrystals (2 nm) uniformly anchored onto GNS were prepared by the nanocasting technique. This material exhibits excellent cycling and rate performance. The capacity of Fe2O3@GNS can reach about 400 mA h g−1 and remain stable over 200 cycles at a current of 100 mA g−1. Even at a high current of 1000 mA g−1, the capacity can reach 190 mA h g−1, which is about 45% value at a lower current of 100 mA g−1. These properties of Fe2O3@GNS make it a promising low-cost anode candidate for NIBs.
