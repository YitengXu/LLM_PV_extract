    , Accepted 20th October 2022First published on 21st October 2022AbstractPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted extensive attention due to their high efficiency and low manufacturing cost, but their practical applications are hindered by the poor structural stability and the toxicity of the heavy metal lead. In this work, we present a comprehensive study on the screening of lead-free hybrid organic–inorganic halide double perovskites (OIHDPs) by first-principles calculations. Based on theoretical evaluations of multilevel performance indicators, including tolerance factor, band gap, decomposition enthalpy, effective mass, and light absorption, we finally screened out 3 lead-free OIHDPs with FAPbI3-comparable performance, namely FA2AgAuBr6, MA2AgAuCl6 and MA2AgAuBr6. Noticeably, they exhibit appropriate band gaps, low carrier effective masses, and excellent photovoltaic absorption performance, which are promising candidates for replacing the lead-based photovoltaic absorber in perovskite solar cells. Our work provides a helpful theoretical guideline for the experiment and accelerates the discovery of environment-friendly candidates for photovoltaic devices.
1. Introduction
Since Kojima et al. first reported the application of CH3NH3PbX3 (MAPbX3) in solar cells,1 halide perovskites ABX3 (A represents a monovalent cation, M is a divalent cation and X is a halogen anion) have attracted renewed attention because of their abundant compositions and adjustable photoelectric properties. In the last decade, through diversity of device optimization technologies, the power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved a leap-forward development and keep approaching their theoretical limit.2,3 As third-generation solar cells, the low cost and high efficiency of perovskites make them ideal candidates for photovoltaic absorber layer materials while the long-term stability and the intrinsic toxicity of Pb are still the main obstacles in industrial deployment.4–8
To address this issue, people try to replace bivalent Pb2+ with Sn2+/Ge2+, but this change leads to larger band gaps and carrier effective masses. Meanwhile, Sn2+/Ge2+ is easily oxidized into Sn4+/Ge4+.9,10 On the other hand, Volonakis et al. proposed the cation-transmutation principle to replace two Pb2+ ions with a pair of nontoxic monovalent/trivalent M1+/M3+ ions,11 thus extending to a class of lead-free halide double perovskites (HDPs). For example, as the counterpart of CsPbBr3, Slavney et al. successfully synthesized single crystal Cs2AgBiBr6 with an indirect band gap of 1.95 eV and found that it has better thermal and moisture stability than MAPbI3.12 Furthermore, Zhang et al. screened out a series of potential HDP candidates theoretically and predicted that Cs2AgInBr6, Rb2AgInBr6, and Rb2CuInCl6 are direct semiconductors with band gaps closer to the optimal value of 1.34 eV, which are promising highly efficient photovoltaic candidates for lead-free HDPs.13
Moreover, by the replacement of the monovalent metal A+ by organic cations, inorganic HDPs can further evolve into organic–inorganic HDPs (OIHDPs).14,15 Compared with their inorganic counterparts, OIHDPs always exhibit higher efficiencies while up to now there are only a few reports on the properties and applications of OIHDPs in solar cells. Herein we conducted a theoretical screening of 112 OIHDPs for PSCs, including the analysis of structural stability, electronic properties and photovoltaic absorption performance. Noticeably, 3 kinds of stable FA2AgAuBr6, MA2AgAuBr6 and MA2AgAuCl6 OIHDPs are predicted with appropriate band gaps of 1.20 eV, 1.23 eV and 1.45 eV respectively and exhibit fairly FAPbBr3-comparable PCE in solar cells. Our work provides helpful theoretical guidance for utilizing these stable and lead-free halide perovskites as promising solar absorbers.
2. Computational details
First-principles calculations were implemented in the Vienna ab initio software package.16,17 The electronic exchange-correlation interaction was described by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional under the generalized gradient approximation (GGA).18 Geometries of all perovskite structures were relaxed until their total energy and forces was converged to within 10−4 eV and 0.01 eV Å−1, respectively. The k-point meshes with a grid spacing of 2π × 0.02 Å−1 was used for electronic Brillouin zone integration. The kinetic cut-off energy of the plane wave basis function was set to 450 eV. At the highest energies of the valence band in semiconductors, and the lowest energies of the conduction band in semiconductors, the band structure E(k) can be locally approximated as  where E(k) is the energy of an electron at wavevector k in that band, E0 is a constant giving the edge of energy of that band. So m* can be calculated by the following equation:  
In order to evaluate their photovoltaic performance, the spectral limiting maximum efficiency (SLME) was calculated at room temperature under the standard AM1.5G solar spectrum based on ref. 19. The photon energy (ω) dependent absorption coefficient α(ω) was calculated in terms of the following equation:  where ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) are the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function, and ω is the photon frequency. And we used the VASPKIT code20 to process the effective mass, band structure and absorption spectrum results.
2. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 exhibits the cation transmutation strategy and the potential elemental compositions in OIHDP models. Starting from the cubic AM2+X3 primitive cell, we expand it into the 2 × 2 × 2 supercell and substitute two M2+ with a pair of M1+ and M3+. For A2M1+M3+X6, two organic cations A+ (methylamine MA/formamidine FA), two monovalent cations M1+ (Ag/Au), seven trivalent cations M3+ (Cu, Al, Ga, Sb, Au, In, Bi) and four halogen anions X− (F/Cl/Br/I) are combined with each other into a total of 112 plausible structures.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of chemical mutation strategy from the halide perovskite AM2+X3 to the halide double perovskite A2M1+M3+X6 and potential chemical elements for A, M1+, M3+, and X. 
At first, a new one-dimensional tolerance factor τ is used to judge whether these 112 compounds are perovskites as follows:    where nA is the oxidation state of A, and rA, rM1+, rM3+ and rX represent the ion radii of A, M1+, M3+ and X, respectively. All the ion radii can be obtained from previous reports.21 According to Christopher et al.'s report, the accuracy of this new tolerance factor can reach more than 90% compared to the 74% of the classical octahedral factor and the Goldschmidt tolerance factor.22 As shown in Fig. 2a, the tolerance factors of these compounds increase in the order of F < Cl < Br < I. Once the τ is over 4.18, it is difficult to form perovskite structures. Six I-based MA(FA)AgAlI3, MA(FA)AgGaI3, and MA(FA)AgAuI3 formulas cannot meet this standard because the large I ion radius makes it more difficult to form octahedral structures. Therefore, 106 compounds are screened out, which are inclined to form OIHDP structures.

Secondly, we study the electronic properties of these 106 plausible OIHDPs, which is a prerequisite for evaluating their potentials in solar cells.23 Considering the effects of functionals and spin-orbital coupling (SOC) in density functional theory, we do a benchmark functional test on calculating the band gaps of traditional FAPbI3, including GGA-level PBE,18 PBEsol24 and PW9125 and hybrid-level PBE026,27 and HSE0628 in Table S1 (ESI†). It is found that adopting the PBE (1.53 eV) and PBE0 + SOC (1.54 eV) functional is consistent with the experimental value (1.47 eV).29 Therefore, we use the PBE functional to preliminarily screen the band gap in the range of 0–1.7 eV and 44 kinds of OIHDPs meet this requirement, in which the FA class has 28 compounds and the MA class has 16 compounds. Furthermore, we investigate the decomposition enthalpies (ΔHD) of these 44 OIHDPs to evaluate their thermodynamic stabilities. In the process of experimental synthesis, binary compounds dissolved in acetone and nitromethane are often used to prepare perovskite materials by slowly evaporating the solvent30 and therefore two decomposition pathways of A2M1+M3+X6 are taken into consideration: one is to degrade into their binary compounds M1+X, M3+X3 and AX,31,32 and another is that organic halogenation is further decomposed into organic matter and hydrogen halide. After comparison, it is found that the former pathway has a larger reaction energy. So, the decomposition enthalpy ΔHD is defined as the energy difference between the perovskite and its respective binary compounds:ΔHD = E(MX) + E(M′X3) + 2E(AX) − E(A2MM′X6)A negative value of ΔHD indicates its instability, while the more positive the ΔHD, the more stable the A2M1+M3+X6 material. Fig. 2b exhibits the decomposition enthalpies and band gaps of these 44 OIHDPs, in which only 13 OIHDPs have positive ΔHD with band gaps between 0 and 1.7 eV. It is noted that the ΔHD of 11 compounds are greater than FAPbI3 (0.117 eV), except FA2AuBiCl6 (0.087 eV) and FA2AgInBr6 (0.021 eV), which also proves their better thermodynamic stabilities. At this stage of GGA-level PBE calculations, 11 OIHDPs are predicted with appropriate band structures and anti-decomposition abilities.
Then we further calculate the electronic properties of these 11 stable candidates using the hybrid functional PBE0 + SOC more accurately because the hybrid functional has the advantage of improved approximations to the exchange and correlation energy component of the total energy while the GGA-level PBE functional sometimes underestimates the practical band gaps.33 The detailed band gap comparison of 11 OIHDPs under the PBE and PBE0 + SOC functional is also given in Table S2 of the ESI.† According to the Shockley–Queisser limit, the maximum efficiency occurs at the band gap of 1.4 eV,34 so we set the screening range of 1.2–1.6 eV. Finally, we find 3 excellent compounds, namely FA2AgAuBr6 (1.20 eV), MA2AgAuBr6 (1.23 eV) and MA2AgAuCl6 (1.45 eV). Through analysing the tolerance factor, band gap and decomposition enthalpy, we fast-screen 112 plausible compounds and finally get 3 kinds of OIHDPs with suitable band gaps and stable perovskite structures.
The calculated band structures of these 3 potential photovoltaic materials based on the PBE + SOC functional are shown in Fig. 3. FA2AgAuBr6 has an indirect semiconductor with a band gap of 1.20 eV; its conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) are located at T and Z, respectively. The effective masses of electrons along the T → Y direction is 0.35me, and the effective masses of holes along the Z → Γ direction is 0.09me. The indirect band gap of MA2AgAuBr6 is 1.23 eV, and its CBM and VBM are located at Y2–Γ and Γ, respectively. The effective masses of electron and holes correspond to 0.18me along Y2–Γ → Γ and 0.10me along Γ → A. MA2AgAuCl6 is the most special because it has a direct band gap of 1.45, with CBM and VBM at Y2. The effective masses of electrons are 0.21me along the Y2 → C2 direction, and the effective masses of holes are 0.23me along the Y2 → C2 direction. Small and balanced carrier effective masses are required for solar cells. This is because the photovoltaic processes require efficient carrier transport, which is beneficial for charge separation in solar cells. For comparison, it is found that the electronic effective mass of these 3 materials is slightly larger than FAPbI3 (0.09me), but the hole effective mass of FA2AgAuBr6 (0.09me) and MA2AgAuBr6 (0.10me) is smaller than FAPbI3 (0.17me). The detailed data of these 4 OIHDPs are summarized in Table 1.

Meanwhile, light absorption is also an important characteristic of solar photovoltaic materials. We simulate the light absorption characteristic spectra of these 3 OIHDPs and compare them with those of traditional FAPbI3. Fig. 4a shows the absorption intensities of 3 OIHDPs in the 0–4 eV photon energy region. A sharper absorption peak corresponds to a larger absorption range for sunlight, which is further promising to exhibit better photoelectric performance. It is found that the absorption edges of our selected 3 OIHDP are better than that of FAPbI3 and, in particular, the FA2AgAuBr6 reaches the absorption peak of 105 cm−1 at about 0.5 eV, which is higher than those of other candidates. Moreover, we further evaluate the SLME because it contains not only the effect of the band gap, but also the absorption spectrum shape and non-radiative recombination loss so it can predict the efficiency of solar cell absorbers closer to practical conditions accurately. Based on the formula defined by Yu and Zunger,19 the SLME of these 3 OIHDPs at 1 μm thickness are as follows: 30.41% for MA2AgAuCl6, 31.45% for MA2AgAuBr6, 31.88% for FA2AuAuBr6 and the SLME of FAPbI3 at 1 μm thickness is 31.82%. Among these 3 selected OIHDPs, all of them are predicted to be over 30% at the thickness of 1 μm, which are promising to exhibit FAPbI3-comparable performance in solar cells.

3. Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrate a theoretical screening to accelerate the discovery of excellent perovskite solar cells. 112 initial structures of hybrid organic–inorganic halide double perovskites are built using the chemical substitution method. By setting a series of screening indicators including tolerance factor, band gap and decomposition enthalpy, effective mass, and absorption spectra, 3 potential candidates, FA2AgAuBr6, MA2AgAuBr6 and MA2AgAuCl6, are predicted as suitable semiconductors for photovoltaic absorber materials with band gaps of 1.20 eV, 1.23 eV and 1.45 eV, respectively. Meanwhile, their positive degradation enthalpies are higher than FAPbI3, indicating their high thermodynamic stability. Their SLME values at 1 μm are 30.41% (MA2AgAuCl6), 31.45% (MA2AgAuBr6), and 31.88% (FA2AuAuBr6), which are comparable to that of traditional FAPbI3 (31.82%). Our work of screening potential lead-free OIHDPs candidates with high thermodynamic stabilities, appropriate band gaps, effective masses, and good photovoltaic absorption performance provides a helpful theoretical guidance and are expected to be synthesized by experiments.
