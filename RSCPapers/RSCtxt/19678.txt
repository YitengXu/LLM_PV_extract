    , Accepted 9th March 2021First published on 11th March 2021AbstractSolid solutions between LaNbON2 and LaMg2/3Nb1/3O3, i.e. (LaNbON2)1−x(LaMg2/3Nb1/3O3)x (0.0 ≤ x ≤ 1.0), have been investigated as photocatalysts for water oxidation into oxygen under visible light illumination (λ ≥ 420 nm). Many important parameters are strongly correlated with solid solution levels, including band gap, nitrogen content, defect concentration,band edge alignments, etc. This offers us a useful tool to steer photocatalytic performance among these solid solutions. Much improved photocatalytic activity is noticed for (LaNbON2)0.8(LaMg2/3Nb1/3O3)0.2 (x = 0.2), which gives an AQE as high as 0.53% at 420 ± 20 nm. This useful strategy by forming solid solutions opens new playgrounds full of opportunities for the design and development of efficient photocatalysts for solar energy conversions.
1. Introduction
Photocatalytic water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen driven by solar insolation is a promising way to mitigate worldwide concerns on energy security and environmental degradation.1–7 This is not only because hydrogen is a clean energy vector with a high combustion value, but also because solar energy is essentially infinite and is widely distributed across the world.8–10 Despite such an attractive prospect, challenges still remain for photocatalytic materials such as limited light absorption, poor charge separation conditions, unsuitable surface reaction sites, instability under water splitting reactions, etc.5,11–14 Searching and developing new photocatalytic materials so as to overcome or mitigate these challenges are strongly desired. Lately, oxynitrides with a perovskite-type structure, i.e. AM(O, N)3 (where A = La, Ca, Sr, or Ba and M = Ti, Ta, or Nb), have gained much attention as they normally have intense visible light absorption and suitable band edge positions that are thermodynamically feasible for water splitting reactions.15–24 Nevertheless, their photocatalytic performance is often unsatisfactory considering their light absorption properties.19,25–27 This has been attributed to a high level of defects (e.g., Ti3+, Nb4+ and Ta4+) produced during their synthesis processes (high-temperature ammonolysis).16,28–31 For instance, although LaNbON2 has strong visible light absorption with an absorption edge as far as 700 nm, Nb4+ and Nb3+ defects are produced during ammonolysis, which are very effective to promote recombination of charge carriers, thereby leading to low photocatalytic performance even in the presence of a sacrificial agent.15,32–35 How to control the level of defects is critical to realize efficient photocatalytic activity over perovskite oxynitrides. This can be exemplified by some recent reports that control of defects by post-treatments or using suitable precursors is very effective to improve the photocatalytic performance.36–40
In this work, we have introduced Mg into the LaNbON2 structure to form solid solutions between LaNbON2 and LaMg2/3Nb1/3O3, i.e. (LaNbON2)1−x(LaMg2/3Nb1/3O3)x (0.0 ≤ x ≤ 1.0). A wealth of important parameters are found to be strongly associated with Mg incorporation, including light absorption, nitrogen content, defect concentration, band edge alignments, etc. This strategy to form solid solutions thereby offers us a useful tool to steer the photocatalytic behavior of LaNbON2.
2. Experimental
2.1 Material synthesis
(LaNbON2)1−x(LaMg2/3Nb1/3O3)x solid solutions were prepared by high-temperature ammonolysis of suitable metal oxide precursors. The metal oxide precursors were synthesized by a citric acid complex method. Taking (LaNbON2)0.8(LaMg2/3Nb1/3O3)0.2 as an example, 1.0000 g of NbCl5, 0.1053 g of Mg(NO3)2·6H2O, 1.7786 g of La(NO3)3·6H2O and 8.0000 g of citric acid were dissolved in 10 mL of ethylene glycol under magnetic stirring. Deionized water was used to promote the dissolution of all chemicals until a transparent solution was formed. The solution was heated on a hotplate at 473 K for 2 h and 573 K for 3 h until a brown gel was formed. The gel was then transferred into an alumina crucible and was calcined at 823 K for 10 h in a muffle furnace to remove organic components. The resultant white powders were ground and used as the metal oxide precursors. For high-temperature ammonolysis, 0.2 g of precursor powders was transferred into an alumina boat and calcined in a tube furnace at 1323 K for 10 h under flowing ultrapure ammonia (Jiaya Chemicals, 99.999%). The typical ammonia flow rate was 250 mL min−1. The obtained sample powders were washed five times with diluted hydrochloric acid and deionized water.
2.2 Materials characterization
Phase purity and crystal structure were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques using a Haoyuan DX 2700B diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα1 (λ = 1.5406 Å) and Cu Kα2 (λ = 1.5444 Å) as incident radiation. The measurement range was 10°–90°, with a step size of 0.02° and a duration time of 0.1 s at each step. General Structure Analysis System (GSAS) software was used for Rietveld refinement on the XRD data collected.41,42 UV–vis absorption spectra were collected on a UV–vis spectrophotometer (JASCO-V750, Japan), and the data were analyzed using the JASCO software suite. BaSO4 is used as a reference non-absorbing material.43 Microstructures of sample powders were inspected using a field emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S4800, Japan). An X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) system (Thermo Escalab 250) equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source was used to investigate the surface nature of all sample powders. The binding energy of XPS spectra was referred to the C 1s peak at 284.7 eV, arising from adventitious carbon.44 The data were treated using XPSPEAKFIT software in which a Gaussian–Lorentzian function (Lorentzian weighting of 20%) and a Shirley-type background was used for peak fit. The nitrogen content of sample powders was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (SETRAM, Labsys evo DSC). Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were collected using an F-7000 FL spectrophotometer. The Mott–Schottky (MS) analysis was performed based on a semiconductor electrode fabricated by depositing sample powders onto FTO glass. The deposition was carried out by an electrophoretic deposition method according to previous reports.45,46 The measurements were carried out based on a three-electrode configuration setup using a Zahner electrochemical workstation. The sample electrode, Pt foil (10 × 10 mm) and an Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the working, counter and reference electrodes, respectively. K3PO4/K2HPO4 (25 mL, 0.1 M, pH = 11.42) was used as an electrolyte and a buffer. Capacitance was extracted from the impedance spectra at a frequency of 1000 Hz.
2.3 Photocatalytic properties
Photocatalytic water splitting experiments were carried out in a top-irradiation-type reactor connected to a gas-closed circulation and evacuation system (Perfect Light, Labsolar-IIIAG). Silver nitrate (0.05 M) served as an electron scavenger to promote photocatalytic water oxidation reactions and La2O3 was employed for pH control.47 CoOx was deposited on the sample as a co-catalyst.48,49 For a typical experiment, 100 mg of sample powders loaded with a suitable cocatalyst were uniformly dispersed into 100 mL of water solution containing a sacrificial agent. The suspensions were then transferred into the reactor equipped with a water jacket to maintain the reaction temperature around 293 K. The reactor was then subjected to evacuation for 30 min to remove dissolved air. A 300 W xenon lamp (Perfect Light, China) equipped with a UV-cutoff filter (λ ≥ 420 nm) was used to produce visible light illumination. Monochromic light illumination was produced by filtering the output of the lamp using a bandpass filter (Perfect Light, China) at 420 nm, 450 nm, 500 nm, 550 nm and 600 nm, respectively. The gas component within the reactor was examined consecutively using an on-line gas chromatograph (TECHCOMP, GC7900). The gas chromatograph was equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and 5 Å molecular sieve columns and Ar was used as the carrier gas. The photon flux of the incident light beam was calibrated using a quantum meter (Apogee MP-300). The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was calculated using eqn (1): (1)
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Phase purity and crystal structure
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-prepared samples (LaNbON2)1−x(LaMg2/3Nb1/3O3)x (0.0 ≤ x ≤ 1.0) are shown in Fig. 1a. All samples show similar patterns to pristine ones of LaNbON2 (ICSD card number 247261) or LaMg2/3Nb1/3O3 (ICSD card number 97826), indicating single phase formation. There are clear shifts of all reflections towards higher angles along with Mg uptake, suggesting decrement of the unit cell as a result of solid solution formation. Although Mg2+ cations are larger than Nb5+ cations, substitution of N with O at anion sites also occurs (1 Mg/Nb substitution is accompanied by 3 O/N replacements for charge neutrality), which greatly modulates the unit cell.50 We then performed Rietveld refinements on the XRD data to gain more structural information. The refined XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 2, and the refined unit cell parameters are plotted in Fig. 1b and tabulated in Table 1. Reasonable goodness-of-fit parameters (Rp, Rwp and χ2) were only achieved assuming that Nb and part of Mg, O and N occupy the same crystallographic positions with identical isotropic temperature factors. A nearly linear decrement of unit cell parameters along with the LaMg2/3Nb1/3O3 content (x) is observed, consistent with the previous deduction. This is also reflected in the average Nb/Mg–O/N bond length that decreases monotonically from LaNbON2 (2.0613 Å) to LaMg2/3Nb1/3O3 (2.0449 Å). A shorter bond length normally indicates a better bonding state (e.g. p–d σ bond) between Nb/Mg and O/N which is critical to the mobility of charge carriers.51,52 A watershed point at x = 0.2 is noticed whereby the space group changes from Pnma to P21/n. This is probably due to a change of M(O, N)6 (M = Nb, Mg) octahedral tilting from LaNbON2 (Glazer notion: a+b−b−) to LaMg2/3Nb1/3O3 (Glazer notion: a+b−c−).

3.2. UV–vis spectroscopy
The color of pristine LaNbON2 is black but turns sequentially to red, orange, yellow and white along with Mg uptake, as shown in the digital photograph (Fig. 3c). Such large color variations indicate substantial changes in visible light absorption, as confirmed by their UV–vis absorption spectra (Fig. 3a). Pristine LaNbON2 has intense absorption across the entire visible light region, consistent with the black hue of sample powders. An absorption edge around 700 nm can be identified although it is severely masked by a high absorption tail that extends deeply into the infrared region. Such an absorption tail is seen in many perovskite oxynitrides and is often attributed to various types of defects (e.g., Nb4+ species).16,53,54 Quite strikingly, introducing Mg effectively damps this absorption tail, resulting in a brightened hue of sample powders (Fig. 3a and c). Therefore, Mg helps to inhibit the formation of defects as has been noticed in other systems.46,55,56 This can be rationalized by the inductive effect of Mg on the Nb–O/N bonds: Mg is less electronegative than Nb whose presence increases the covalency of neighboring Nb–O/N bonds and stabilizes Nb in its higher oxidation state.57 In addition, a shorter Nb/Mg–O/N bond length caused by Mg incorporation may also have some contributions to this point as a higher crystal-field stabilization energy is expected under this circumstance.56 Nevertheless, a gradual blue-shift of the absorption edge occurs as the Mg content increases in the solid solutions, indicating increment of the band gap from LaNbON2 to LaMg2/3Nb1/3O3. The band gap values of solid solutions are determined by the Tauc plot and the results are presented in Table S2.†58 A large change in the band gap of these solid solutions can be noticed, which is probably correlated with their different nitrogen contents in the structure according to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). These results are consistent with the previous expectation from a charge neutrality viewpoint.

3.3. Microstructures
The sample powders of solid solutions were also inspected under microscopic conditions. Fig. 4 shows their typical field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images. All samples except LaMg2/3Nb1/3O3 have porous microstructures, likely due to O/N exchange during high-temperature ammonolysis . A high porosity is generally beneficial for photocatalytic reactions as it increases surface reaction sites and facilitates mass transportation. The SEM-EDS analysis suggests that all constituent elements are distributed homogeneously across the entire particles (Fig. S1†).

3.4. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was applied to probe the surface conditions of (LaNbON2)1−x(LaMg2/3Nb1/3O3)x(0.0 ≤ x ≤ 1.0). The spectra for core-level electrons of the constituent elements are shown in Fig. 5. For the Nb 3d state, four overlapping peaks centered at around 205.8 eV, 207.3 eV, 208.6 eV and 210.0 eV are identified.44 The two peaks at the lower binding energy side, i.e. 205.8 eV and 208.6 eV, are attributed to the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 states of Nb4+ species, whilst those at the higher binding energy side belong to Nb5+ species (Fig. 5a).59,60 Increasing the Mg content in the solid solutions clearly decreases the peak intensity of Nb4+ species. In particular, complete removal of Nb4+ species is achieved at a high Mg content (x ≥ 0.8), highlighting again the effectiveness of Mg in inhibiting Nb4+ defects. The O 1s states of all samples contain two overlapping peaks centered at 529.8 and 531.5 eV, attributed to the lattice oxygen (O2−) and hydroxyl groups (OH−), respectively.28,61,62 Interestingly, the intensity of the latter peak increased along with the Mg content, indicating an improvement of surface hydrophilicity. The N 1s state of all samples exhibits a broad peak at around 396 eV, assignable to lattice nitrogen (N3−).28 This peak decreases gradually by increasing the Mg content, consistent with TGA. The Mg 1s state also involves a broad peak at around 1303 eV whose peak intensity agrees with the content of Mg in the solid solutions.

3.5. Photocatalytic water oxidation
The photocatalytic performances of solid solutions (LaNbON2)1−x(LaMg2/3Nb1/3O3)x (0.0 ≤ x ≤ 1.0) were tested by monitoring their oxygen evolution reactions from water under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm). Control experiments were firstly carried out to validate the experimental results in which water, light illumination or sample powders were missing. No oxygen was detected in these control experiments, precluding any spontaneous oxygen evolution reactions. The temporal oxygen evolution profile for sample powders illuminated in the presence of the sacrificial agent is shown Fig. 6a. In contrast to LaMg2/3Nb1/3O3 that is completely inert under visible light illumination, all other samples exhibit constant oxygen production over the entire 2.5 h illumination period. It is worth noting that solid solutions exhibit an improved or at least comparable photocatalytic activity compared with pristine LaNbON2, although their visible light sensitivity is somewhat decreased. The large variations in their photocatalytic activities imply that many factors may influence the activity of the solid solutions, e.g. light absorption, defect concentration, surface states, etc. The highest photocatalytic activity for oxygen production was observed for the sample (LaNbON2)0.8(LaMg2/3Nb1/3O3)0.2 (x = 0.2), whose activity was further investigated by varying the amounts of CoOx loaded. The optimal loading point is found to be 2 wt% for (LaNbON2)0.8(LaMg2/3Nb1/3O3)0.2 (x = 0.2) and is used for AQE determination. The action spectra for (LaNbON2)0.8(LaMg2/3Nb1/3O3)0.2 (x = 0.2) are shown in Fig. 6c. As can be seen from Fig. 6c, the AQE decreases rapidly from 420 nm to 600 nm even though the UV–vis absorption spectra suggest substantial light absorption above 600 nm. Such a large discrepancy can be rationalized by the defects’ dominated absorption above 600 nm, which has no contribution to the photocatalytic activity. The highest AQE approaches 0.53% at 420 ± 20 nm.

(b) The photocatalytic oxygen evolution rate of the sample (LaNbON2)0.8(LaMg2/3Nb1/3O3)0.2 (x = 0.2) loaded with different amounts of CoOx. (c) Action spectra (apparent quantum efficiency vs. excitation wavelength) of (LaNbON2)0.8(LaMg2/3Nb1/3O3)0.2 (x = 0.2) for O2 production; silver nitrate aqueous solution (0.05 M) and 2 wt% CoOx were used as a sacrificial agent and a cocatalyst, respectively. 
3.6. Band edge positions
The band edge positions of LaNbON2 (x = 0.0), (LaNbON2)0.8(LaMg2/3Nb1/3O3)0.2 (x = 0.2) and LaMg2/3Nb1/3O3 (x = 1.0) have been investigated to understand their different photocatalytic activities. This was realized by Mott–Schottky (MS) analysis. Their MS plots are shown in Fig. 7a. All compounds show a positive MS slope, indicating n-type semiconductivity according to the Mott–Schottky equation (eqn (2)): (2)were C is the interfacial capacitance, ε is the relative dielectric constant, ε0 is the vacuum dielectric constant, A is the area of the electrode, e is the electronic charge, ND is the donor concentration, V is the applied bias, Vfb is the value of the flat band, kB is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the absolute temperature. Accordingly, their flat band potential is determined which is found to be −0.15 V, −0.17 V and −0.55 V vs. RHE for LaNbON2 (x = 0.0), (LaNbON2)0.8(LaMg2/3Nb1/3O3)0.2 (x = 0.2) and LaMg2/3Nb1/3O3 (x = 1.0), respectively. Assuming that their conduction band edges lie very close to the flat band potential, which is reasonable for semiconductors with a high donor concentration, their band edge positions can be deduced and are schematically plotted in Fig. 7b. It can be seen from Fig. 7b that LaMg2/3Nb1/3O3 (x = 1.0) is a wide band gap semiconductor whose valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) are shifted closer to the water redox potential after introducing nitrogen into the structure. It is worth noting that the VBM of (LaNbON2)0.8(LaMg2/3Nb1/3O3)0.2 (x = 0.2) shifts positively with respect to pristine LaNbON2, while its CBM remains almost unchanged. This at least partially explains the improved photocatalytic activity of (LaNbON2)0.8(LaMg2/3Nb1/3O3)0.2 (x = 0.2) for water oxidation as photo-generated holes will have a higher oxidation power. In addition, the much larger slope of MS curves for (LaNbON2)0.8(LaMg2/3Nb1/3O3)0.2 (x = 0.2) also implies that it has a lower donor concentration, consistent with the previous results that Mg inhibits Nb4+ defects. This is also supported by their PL spectra in which (LaNbON2)0.8(LaMg2/3Nb1/3O3)0.2 (x = 0.2) shows the lowest PL intensity among all samples (Fig. S3†).

4. Conclusions
We have synthesized complete solid solutions between LaNbON2 and LaMg2/3Nb1/3O3, i.e. (LaNbON2)1−x(LaMg2/3Nb1/3O3)x (0.0 ≤ x ≤ 1.0) and applied them as photocatalysts for water oxidation under visible light illumination (λ ≥ 420 nm). Many important parameters become tunable by changing solid solution levels, including the band gap, nitrogen content, defect concentration, band edge alignments, etc. This offers us a useful tool to tailor the photocatalytic activity of LaNbON2. Indeed, much improved photocatalytic activity for water oxidation into oxygen has been noticed in the solid solution (LaNbON2)0.8(LaMg2/3Nb1/3O3)0.2 (x = 0.2), which gives an AQE as high as 0.53% at 420 ± 20 nm.
