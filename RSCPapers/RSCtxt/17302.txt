    , Accepted 20th May 2013First published on 21st May 2013AbstractTo date, most studies on the fabrication and development of photoelectrodes for solar-fuel generation have been based on simple binary systems with limited success. However, ternary systems have not been explored extensively although they can offer more possibilities for band gap and band alignment tuning that allow the development of more efficient photoelectrochemical systems. Herein, we report on the growth of a novel ternary oxide photoanode material composed of self-ordered, vertically oriented nanotube arrays of titanium–molybdenum–nickel mixed oxide films via the anodization of a Ti–Mo–Ni alloy in an electrolyte solution of formamide containing NH4F at room temperature, followed by annealing in an air atmosphere. The nanostructure topology was found to depend on both the anodization time and the applied voltage. Our results demonstrate the ability to grow mixed oxide nanotube array films that are several microns thick. The Ti–Mo–Ni mixed oxide nanotube array films were utilized in solar-spectrum water photoelectrolysis, demonstrating a photocurrent density of 2.1 mA cm−2 and a ∼10 fold increase in the photoconversion efficiency under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2, 1 M KOH) compared to pure TiO2 nanotubes fabricated under the same conditions. This enhancement in the photoconversion efficiency can be related to the synergistic effects of Ni and Mo alloying and the unique structural properties of the fabricated nanotube arrays.
1. Introduction
Solar-driven water electrolysis has been explored extensively over the past few decades as a renewable means of hydrogen production.1 In this regard, metal oxide photoanodes are primarily being used in hydrogen production photoelectrochemical cells (PEC) due to their exceptional semiconducting properties, physical and chemical stability, abundance and low cost.2 Of particular interest, low-dimensional semiconductor nanostructures have recently become the focus of many fundamental and applied research activities in the field of solar energy conversion.1–4 To this end, anodically fabricated TiO2 nanotube arrays have proven to be a robust and cost-effective functional material, widely investigated in many applications especially those related to energy conversion such as photoelectrochemical water splitting and solar cells.5,6 The nanotubular structure allows the precise design and control of the geometrical features with specific light absorption and propagation characteristics.6,7 In addition, the aligned porosity, crystallinity, and oriented nature of the nanotubular structure make it an attractive electron percolation pathway for vectorial charge transfer between interfaces.8,9 However, TiO2 is responsive only to UV light, which accounts for only a small fraction of the sun's spectrum. As visible light comprises ∼45% of the solar spectrum, any shift in the optical response of TiO2 from the UV to the visible spectral range, while maintaining its intrinsic properties (especially the excellent charge transfer properties and photo-corrosion stability), will have a positive impact on the photocatalytic and photo-electrochemical utility of the material. In this regard, compositional doping of TiO2 with different elements was considered as an approach for band gap engineering.10–14 Although doping has been demonstrated as an efficient approach to introduce visible light absorption into TiO2, the currently used doping protocols are not without serious structural artifacts/defects and problems that introduce defect–dopant lattice interactions, which can mask the fundamental interactions of the dopant with the lattice.10,13 A recent and promising approach to overcome such problems is to develop and optimize semiconductor materials made of 1D mixed oxide nanoarchitectures. The reported preliminary results of such systems showed a great enhancement in the optical/electrical properties over the doped counterparts. Mor et al.15 reported the anodization of Ti–Fe films to fabricate Ti–Fe–O mixed oxide nanotube arrays with enhanced photoelectrochemical water splitting performance over their pristine and Fe-doped TiO2 counterpart electrodes. Allam et al.16 were able to grow a uniform suite of Ti–Nb–Zr–O mixed oxide nanotube arrays. The fabricated mixed oxide nanotubes showed a ∼17.5% increase in the photoelectrochemical water oxidation efficiency as compared to pure TiO2 nanotubes of comparable length. Kusama et al.17 reported a combinatorial approach to systematically investigate the visible light response of Fe–Ti–M oxides (M: various metal elements) for photoelectrochemical water splitting. Among the 25 elements tested, the Fe–Ti–Sr mixed oxide has been identified as the best combination because it showed the highest photocurrent. Also, Lewis et al.18 have developed a high-throughput method using a commercial inkjet printer for the synthesis of mixed-metal oxide photoelectrode materials for water splitting. The experiments presented a methodology where the open-circuit potential of the material was determined, which provided critical additional information not readily and rapidly available from photocurrent-only measurements.18
In this work, we investigate the possibility to fabricate Ti–Mo–Ni mixed oxide nanotube arrays via anodization of the Ti–Mo–Ni alloy in fluoride-ion containing electrolytes and test their efficiency as photoanodes for water oxidation. This specific mixed oxide system was chosen for the following reasons:
1. NiO has energy level positions suitable for use as a hole-transport material,19 which is expected to facilitate charge transfer and reduce recombination of excitons.
2. Ni-doped TiO2 was shown to have a shift in the absorption spectra towards the visible region of the light spectrum.20
3. The addition of MoO3 to TiO2 was shown to increase the catalyst surface acidity,21 which is expected to enhance the activity of the photocatalyst.
4. MoO3 is well known to lose oxygen from its lattice at low temperature leaving excess electrons in the solid and giving rise to electrical conductivity, primarily due to thermally activated hopping of polarons,22 which is a desired property to develop an efficient photoanode material.
5. The ease of reducibility of MoO321 is expected to make the electron transfer rate controlling step more efficient and hence will increase the overall photocatalytic activity of the mixed oxide system.
6. The Mo-doped TiO2 photoelectrodes were shown to have a significant red shift in the absorption spectra compared to pristine TiO2 photoanodes, owing to the higher electronegativity of Mo6+.23
7. The use of 4d cations as donors, with higher atomic d orbital energies than that of Ti, will guarantee that the CBM energy level will not be lowered.24
Our ability to fabricate nanotubular structure of Ti–Mo–Ni mixed oxides is significant because they showed one of the highest photoconversion efficiencies when employed in a photoelectrochemical water splitting system. We hope that this study will open new avenues of research for the exploration of additional combinations of materials and various new applications.
2. Experimental section
Prior to anodization, Ti–0.3Mo–0.8Ni alloy samples (UNS R53400) from ET UK Ltd (1.5 cm × 1.0 cm × 1.0 mm) were ultrasonically cleaned with acetone followed by a deionized water rinse. The anodization was performed in a two-electrode electrochemical cell with the titanium alloy as the working electrode and the platinum foil as the counter electrode. The experiments were conducted at room temperature (approximately 22 °C) in formamide-based electrolytes containing 0.2 M NH4F, 0.1 M H3PO4, and 3 vol% H2O at different applied voltages (20–60 V) and/or durations (3–16 h). After anodization, the samples were rinsed thoroughly with deionized water and then dried under a stream of nitrogen. The as-anodized samples were annealed in an air atmosphere for 4 h at 450 °C at a heating and cooling rate of 1 °C min−1. The morphology of the anodized samples was examined using a Zeiss SEM Ultra 60 field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were performed on the Ti–Mo–Ni nanotubular films using a Thermo Scientific K-alpha XPS with an Al anode. Spectra were charge-referenced to O 1s at 532 eV. The crystalline phases were detected and identified using a glancing angle X-ray diffractometer (GAXRD) on an X'Pert PRO MRD with a copper source at a scan rate (2θ) of 0.05° s−1. The optical characterization of the films was performed using a Shimadzu UV-3101PC UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer with a solid sample holder for reflectance measurements and an integrating sphere. The photoelectrochemical properties were investigated in 1.0 M KOH solution using a three-electrode configuration with the nanotube arrays as photoanodes, saturated Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and a platinum foil as the counter electrode. A scanning potentiostat (CH Instruments, model CH 660D) was used to measure dark and illuminated currents at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Sunlight was simulated using a 300 W ozone-free xenon lamp and AM 1.5G filter at 100 mW cm−2.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Morphological characterization
We aimed at anodizing pure titanium and Ti–Mo–Ni alloy samples in formamide-based electrolytes because anodization of titanium6 and its alloys16 in aqueous electrolytes usually results in the formation of short nanotubes with irregular outer diameters that contain ridges and circumferential serrations. The use of formamide, however, usually results in the formation of smooth nanotubes that are micrometers in length. This morphology is achieved by reducing the changes in pH and suppressing the local concentration fluctuations during the anodization process.6,16 Herein, we studied the effect of both time and applied voltage on the morphology of the fabricated nanoarchitectures.

3.1.1 Effect of anodization time. 

Fig. 1 shows the FESEM top-view and cross-sectional images of Ti–0.3Mo–0.8Ni samples anodized in formamide-based electrolytes containing 0.2 M NH4F, 0.1 M H3PO4 and 3 vol% H2O at 20 V for different times. The tubular structure, covering the entire substrate, is evident in all cases. The nanotube formation mechanism is described in detail in the literature.6,25 Briefly, the first step involves the anodic oxidation of the alloy substrate through its interaction with oxygen ions (O2−) in the electrolyte, resulting in the formation of a poorly conducting thin oxide layer. It is believed that the nanotubular structure formation includes a competition between electrochemical etching and chemical dissolution processes, where small pits are initially formed due to the localized dissolution of the previously formed thin oxide layer, followed by the coalescence of these pits to form pores.6,25 Upon increasing the anodization time, pores become deeper and wider with small inner-tube void diameters and relatively thick tube walls that continue to grow until well-organized nanotube arrays are formed. It is important to mention that the nanotube growth should stop once the rates of electrochemical etching and the chemical dissolution become equal.6,26
 Fig. 1  FESEM images for Ti–0.3Mo–0.8Ni samples anodized at 20 V for (a) 3 h, (b) 4 h, (c) 5 h, (d) 7 h, (e) 10 h, and (f) 16 h in formamide electrolytes containing 0.2 M NH4F, 0.1 M H3PO4 and 3% H2O. 

Fig. 2 summarizes the variation in the nanotube dimensions (length, diameter and wall thickness) as a function of the anodization time. The nanotube length was kept almost constant (1 μm) with increasing anodization time during the first five hours followed by an exponential increase after 7 hours (1.95 μm at 7 h and 11.87 μm at 16 h). This can be an indication that the rate of movement of the alloy/nanotube interface is faster than the rate of loss of nanotubes by chemical etching.6 The nanotube diameter increases linearly with increasing anodization time reaching 134 nm after 10 h, then decreasing to 115 nm after 16 h. This behavior can be understood based on the change in the conductivity of the electrolyte.27 That is, as the anodization proceeds, the concentration of leached ions from the alloy substrate increases and in turn the conductivity of the electrolyte increases. This increase in conductivity makes a large proportion of the applied potential available for the anodization process leading to the observed increase in both length and diameter of the formed nanotubes. The wall thickness of the fabricated Ti–Mo–Ni nanotubes, on the other hand, was found to slightly vary (24 ± 5 nm) during the first 10 h followed by a decrease to 9 nm after 16 h of anodization. A pure Ti sample anodized under the same conditions (20 V, 16 h) resulted in the formation of nanotubes that are 12 μm in length, 180 nm in outer diameter and 20 nm in wall thickness, in agreement with the literature pertaining to Ti anodization.6,26,27

3.1.2 Effect of applied voltage. 

Fig. 3 shows FESEM top-view and cross-sectional images of anodized Ti–Ni–Mo samples in formamide electrolytes containing 0.2 M NH4F, 0.1 M H3PO4 and 3 vol% H2O for 5 h at different applied voltages. The nanotube formation is evident over the entire applied voltage range (20–60 V). Well-defined nanotube arrays can be distinguished for the samples anodized both at 20 V and 30 V. Upon increasing the anodization voltage to 40 V, precipitate debris starts to appear on scattered areas of the surface of nanotubes due to the slow rate of chemical etching of the oxide by fluoride ions.6,27 The nanotubes formed at 60 V are separated by large intertubular spacings, similar to those usually seen upon anodizing Ti in highly viscous electrolytes.27,28 The intertubular spacing can be related to the consumption of some of the nanotubes by chemical etching aided by the high applied voltage.28

Fig. 4 summarizes the variation in the nanotube dimensions (length, diameter and wall thickness) as a function of the anodization voltage. The nanotube length increases slightly from 0.85 μm to 0.94 μm upon increasing the applied voltage from 20 V to 30 V. Increasing the applied voltage to 40 V almost doubles the tube length (2.9 μm), which continues to increase with increasing anodization voltage (3.9 μm at 60 V). This increase in the nanotube length with larger anodization potentials can be related to the increased electric field intensity as well as driving force for ionic transport through the barrier layer at the bottom of the pore6 resulting in faster movement of the alloy/oxide interface into the metallic alloy. The nanotube diameters show a steady increase up to 40 V (82 nm, 138 nm and 160 nm for the samples anodized at 20 V, 30 V and 40 V, respectively) followed by an abrupt increase to 368 nm upon increasing the applied voltage to 60 V. The wall thickness of nanotubes, however, showed a constant value (∼18 nm) up to 40 V, followed by a sudden increase at 60 V (53 nm). This trend is in a general agreement with the reported behavior of pure titanium6 and titanium alloys such as Ti–Fe,15 Ti–Nb–Zr16 and Ti–Pd29 anodized in similar electrolytes. However, the obtained tube lengths are larger than those reported for other alloys15,16,29 but with thinner tube walls.

3.2 Compositional and structural characterization
As the anodically fabricated nanotube arrays are usually amorphous,9,28 we annealed the Ti–Mo–Ni nanotubes, obtained via anodization for 3, 5 and 7 h, in an air atmosphere at 450 °C for 4 h to crystallize them. Fig. 5 shows the obtained XRD patterns confirming the crystalline nature of the electrodes with reflections mainly from anatase TiO2 (PDF card 35-734, JCPDS). Note the shift in the anatase peaks’ positions in all the samples compared to those reported for pure TiO2.9,28 This shift can be attributed to the incorporation of foreign species into the crystal lattice of TiO2.13,14 Additionally, two peaks that were indexed at 35° and 63° can be associated with NiO (111) and (220), respectively.19 Another weak peak was obtained at 48°, which can be related to Ti–Ni.19 The very intense reflection appearing at 2θ ≈ 40° can be related to the titanium substrate.28 Note that no diffraction lines or peaks of Mo-containing phases were obtained, which can be related to the low concentration of Mo in the alloy substrate.
 Fig. 5  X-ray diffraction patterns of the annealed nanotube arrays (450 °C for 4 h in air with a ramp rate of 1 degree per min) fabricated via the anodization of Ti–Mo–Ni samples in formamide-based electrolytes for 3, 5 and 7 hours. 
To further investigate the composition of the fabricated electrodes, an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed on the nanotube arrays fabricated via anodization at 20 V for 5 h in a formamide-based electrolyte. Fig. 6 shows the obtained XPS spectra with reflections from Ti 2p, Mo 3d, Ni 2p and O 1s. Fig. 6a shows the Ti 2p spectra where two peaks were obtained corresponding to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 photoemission spectra with a spin–orbit splitting of ∼5.7 eV, confirming that both signals correspond to Ti4+.30,31Fig. 6b represents the Mo 3d spectra, where two peaks can be distinguished at 232.3 and 235.8 eV, confirming that Mo exists mainly in the oxidation state of Mo6+ in the mixed oxide nanotubes.30–34 Although the presence of Mo species with oxidation states higher than 4 may raise a question on the ability of such species to replace Ti, the radius of Mo6+ (r = 0.062 nm) is closer to that of Ti4+ (r = 0.068 nm), which makes it possible for Mo6+ to replace Ti4+ when the doping content is kept on a relatively low level. The spectrum of the Ni 2p region is shown in Fig. 6c. The main peaks located at 855.9 eV and 873.5 eV can be related to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2, respectively, indicating the existence of NiO.34–36 The O 1s photoemission spectra show one signal at 531.6 eV, which can be related to the existence of metal oxides, Fig. 6d. The shoulder seen at 529.9 eV can be related to the existence of Mo and/or Ni oxides.34,37–41 Therefore, the XPS investigation confirmed the existence of all components of the alloy in the oxide form.

3.3 Optical and photoelectrochemical properties
To investigate the optical properties of the fabricated electrodes, the diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the annealed pure TiO2 and Ti–Mo–Ni nanotube electrodes were measured; see Fig. 7. The absorption edge (390 nm for the TiO2 electrode and 457–464 nm for the Ti–Mo–Ni mixed oxide electrodes) shows a significant red shift for the mixed oxide electrodes. The slight difference in the absorption edge positions between the mixed oxide samples can be related to the difference in nanotube length between the tested electrodes; see Fig. 2. A similar shift was reported for TiO2–NiO nanotube electrodes,37,42 and related to the overlap between the d-orbitals of Ti with that of Ni leading to a decrease in the energy gap between Ti(d) and O(p) orbitals of Ti oxide to enable visible light absorption. Also, Stengl and Bakardjieva23 reported similar red shift for Mo-doped titania films. They related the enhancement to the creation of new energy levels that are 0.4 eV below the conduction band edge, which led to a faster interfacial electron transfer rate and a slower recombination rate of electron–hole pairs. Moreover, the  state () is acting as an electron donor below the conduction band edge,43 where MoTi refers to Mo in the Ti lattice site, OO is an oxygen occupying an oxygen site, VO is an oxygen vacancy, (˙) represents an excess charge and (°) represents a deficiency in the charge.

A preliminary proof-of-concept photoelectrochemical activity test for water photoelectrolysis using the synthesized Ti–Mo–Ni mixed oxide nanotube arrays was carried out. Fig. 8a shows the photocurrent density versus potential in 1 M KOH solution under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2) for TiO2 nanotubes (16 h anodization, annealed at 450 °C for 4 h) and Ti–Mo–Ni mixed oxide nanotube array electrodes (10 h and 16 h anodization, annealed at 450 °C for 4 h). The dark current was less than 5 μA cm−2 for all samples over the displayed potential range. The maximum photocurrent of the pure TiO2 nanotube sample (∼12 μm long, 20 nm wall thickness and 180 nm diameter) was ∼0.29 mA cm−2, in agreement with the literature.6 However, the photocurrent increased almost seven times (2.1 mA cm−2) upon the use of Ti–Mo–Ni mixed oxide nanotube electrodes fabricated and tested under the same conditions as those for the pure TiO2 nanotube electrode. We noticed that the mixed oxide nanotube samples fabricated after 10 h showed a lower photocurrent (1.6 mA cm−2) than those synthesized after 16 h. This difference in the photocurrent can be related to the difference in nanotube length in agreement with the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) simulation, which showed that the absorption and the photocurrent can vary linearly with the nanotube length.26 Also, the onset potential in the case of Ti–Mo–Ni mixed oxide nanotubes (−0.98 VAg/AgCl) is more negative than that of a TiO2 nanotube array electrode (−0.92 VAg/AgCl). This open-circuit voltage represents the contribution of light towards the minimum voltage needed for water splitting potential.6 The current–voltage characteristics of an illuminated semiconductor electrode in contact with a redox electrolyte can be described using the following equation:44,45 (1)where i is the net current obtained by adding the majority and minority current components, i0 is the reverse bias saturation current and iph is the illumination current, which is proportional to the photon flux. The tested nanotube array electrodes show n-type behavior, i.e., positive photocurrents at anodic potentials. For this type of semiconductor, the surface electron density (Ns) decreases with the applied anodic potentials (Ea) as:29,45 (2)where Nb is the electron density in the semiconductor, Vfb is its flat-band potential, e is the elementary charge, k is Boltzmann's constant; and T is the absolute temperature. Note that Ns < Nb for an n-type semiconductor at all potentials positive of Vfb.
 Fig. 8  (a) Photocurrent density vs. potential in 1 M KOH solution under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) for pure TiO2 and Ti–Mo–Ni nanotube electrodes, (b) the corresponding photoconversion efficiency and (c) the corresponding current transients obtained for the Ti–Mo–Ni mixed oxide photoanode at an applied voltage of 1.0 VAg/AgCl. 
The corresponding light energy to chemical energy conversion (photoconversion) efficiencies are shown in Fig. 8b. The photoconversion efficiency η was calculated via:6η% = [(total power output − electrical power input)/light power input] × 100 = jp[(E0rev − |Eappl|)/I0] × 100(3)where jp is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2), JpE0rev is the total power output, jp|Eappl| is the electrical power input, and I0 is the power density of incident light (100 mW cm−2). E0rev is the standard reversible potential, which is 1.23 VNHE and the applied potential Eappl = Emeas − Eaoc, where Emeas is electrode potential (versus Ag/AgCl) of the working electrode at which the photocurrent was measured under illumination and Eaoc is the electrode potential (versus Ag/AgCl) of the same working electrode under open circuit conditions under same illumination and in the same electrolyte. The photoconversion efficiencies for the synthesized nanotube arrays, under AM 1.5G illumination, are ≈1.04% and 0.71% for the Ti–Mo–Ni–O electrodes and 0.13% for the TiO2 nanotubes. Although the difference in tube length can be used to explain the different photoconversion efficiencies of the 2.8 μm and 11.8 μm long mixed oxide nanotubes,26 the very thin wall thickness of the 16 h-synthesized Ti–Mo–Ni mixed oxide nanotube arrays (9 nm) compared to that of pure TiO2 nanotubes (20 nm) can be the reason for the enhanced photoelectrochemical response of the mixed oxide photoanodes compared to their pure titania counterparts.6 The nanotubular architecture, with a wall thickness of 9 nm, ensures that the photogenerated holes are never generated far from the semiconductor–electrolyte interface.46 Furthermore, since half the wall thickness is significantly less than the minority carrier diffusion length (≈20 nm in TiO2),47 charge carrier separation takes place efficiently. In this regard, the potential drop (ΔΦ0) within the tube wall is a function of both Debye length (LD) and half the width of the wall (r0):29,46 (4)where LD is a function of the number of ionized donors per cm3 (ND): (5)The nanoscale dimensions of the nanotube walls (9 nm), along with the potential drop within the walls, may facilitate the diffusion of holes to the surface and escape recombination.16,46 The hole diffusion process was shown to takes place on a scale of picoseconds,48,49 which becomes easier when the holes are created within the retrieval length of the material;16,46 the sum of the depletion layer width and the diffusion length. As the r0 values of the mixed oxide nanotubes are all smaller than 10 nm (retrieval length of TiO250), holes are expected to escape recombination resulting in an enhanced photoconversion efficiency.50,51 This is in agreement with van de Lagemaat and co-workers who observed a substantial enhancement of the quantum yield in porous SiC made by anodic etching in HF solutions.51
Another factor could be that the NiO and MoO3 help slow down charge recombination and/or facilitate the hole diffusion to the interface, which should improve the conversion efficiency.19,20,37,38 For example, it was shown that recombination of excitons is significantly reduced when TiO2 is mixed with NiO, due to the energy level positions of NiO that facilitate the hole transport.19 Also, the electron transfer rate controlling step was shown to be more efficient upon mixing TiO2 with MoO3.21 This was related to the ease of reducibility of MoO3. Moreover, as a general note the use of 4d cations as donors with higher atomic d orbital energies than that of Ti is expected to guarantee high electron mobility.24
To assess the stability of the mixed oxide photoanodes, the transient photocurrent (J–t) test of the 16 h-fabricated Ti–Mo–Ni electrodes was carried out under light on/off illumination at constant external bias of 1.0 VAg/AgCl, as shown in Fig. 8c. The photocurrent of the tested electrode decays very sharply under light-off conditions without exhibiting pronounced photocurrent tails suggesting that the fabricated photoanode has excellent carrier transport properties.52,53
Conclusions
Vertically oriented Ti–Mo–Ni mixed oxide nanotube arrays were fabricated via anodization of the Ti–Mo–Ni alloy in formamide electrolytes containing NH4F and H3PO4 at room temperature. The morphology and dimensions of the formed nanoarchitectures were found to depend on both anodization voltage and anodization time. Upon anodizing the alloy at 20 V, the resulting nanotube length was almost constant (1 μm) during the first five hours followed by an exponential increase (1.95 μm at 7 h and 11.87 μm at 16 h) afterwards. The nanotube diameter increases linearly with increasing anodization time reaching 134 nm after 10 h, and then decreases to 115 nm after 16 h. The wall thickness of the fabricated Ti–Mo–Ni nanotubes, on the other hand, was found to slightly vary (24 ± 5 nm) during the first 10 h followed by a decrease to 9 nm after 16 h of anodization. Studying the effect of applied voltage showed that the nanotube length increases from 0.85 μm to 3.9 μm upon increasing the applied voltage from 20 V to 60 V. The nanotube diameters show a steady increase up to 40 V (82 nm, 138 nm and 160 nm for the samples anodized at 20 V, 30 V and 40 V, respectively) followed by an abrupt increase to 368 nm upon increasing the applied voltage to 60 V. The wall thickness of nanotubes, however, showed a constant value (∼18 nm) up to 40 V, followed by a sudden increase at 60 V (53 nm). The formation of mixed oxide nanotubes (as confirmed via XPS analysis) showed a profound effect on the light absorption capability of the material shifting the absorption edge from 390 nm for pure TiO2 to 464 nm for the mixed oxide. The 11.8 μm long Ti–Mo–Ni mixed oxide nanotube arrays showed a three-electrode photoconversion efficiency of 1.04% (AM 1.5G illumination 100 mW/cm−2, 1.0 M KOH) when used as photoanodes to photoelectrochemically split water. This efficiency is almost 10 times higher than that obtained for pure TiO2 nanotubes (0.13%) of comparable length. This enhancement in the photoconversion efficiency can be related to the synergistic effects of Mo and Ni oxides as well as to the unique structural properties of the fabricated nanotube arrays. The obtained efficiency herein is among the highest reported values so far for the TiO2 nanotube-based photoelectrochemical cell. Further extended studies are currently being conducted in our laboratory to investigate more combinations for efficient water photolysis.
