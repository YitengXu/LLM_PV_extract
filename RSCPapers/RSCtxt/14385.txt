    , Accepted 5th December 2022First published on 21st December 2022AbstractThe process of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting using semiconductor materials offers a remarkable opportunity to convert incident solar energy into chemical energy in hydrogen in a single step. This review chronicles the significant efforts made in developing non-oxide semiconductor materials to enable efficient hydrogen production using this process. We highlight some of these spectacular developments, ranging from the design of entirely new materials to innovative engineering of existing and known non-oxide semiconductors materials in terms of their morphology, composition and band structure such they can act as viable photoelectrodes. We start with a primer on fundamentals of the PEC process, followed by an overview of the materials development efforts. Then the review focuses on a key challenge in the large-scale uptake of these promising non-oxide materials, namely that of stability when in contact with harsh acidic or alkaline electrolytes. The review ends by outlining some of the next generation photoactive materials that are currently being pursued. We anticipate this review will spur on further research and development of non-oxide materials and devices, through both theoretical and experimental works. It is hoped ultimately to realize breakthrough non-oxide semiconductors that will enable improved performance, longer lifetimes and reduced production costs of hydrogen.
1. Introduction
Demand for clean renewable energy is increasing globally and there is a significant global effort to push solar energy as a primary resource and technology for a clean and sustainable future. However, solar energy is intermittent in nature; to address this intermittency issue and make large-scale use of solar energy more viable, hydrogen or other clean fuels should be produced to allow for energy storage and transport. Converting solar energy into hydrogen is seemingly ideal because burning hydrogen does not produce any greenhouse gas emissions. The hydrogen can be utilized to power vehicles, and/or supply energy into electricity grids, while it can also be used as a feedstock to make chemicals and steel, where it can substitute for fossil fuel-derived hydrogen in these industries, forming the basis of the so-called hydrogen economy.1 To make this possible, from a materials chemistry discovery and development perspective, there is essentially one key question – what new materials can we create to convert solar energy to hydrogen in an efficient and environmentally-friendly manner?
One solar-driven approach for clean hydrogen production is water splitting. There are two main methods that involve the use of light-absorbing semiconductors to directly convert solar energy to hydrogen – photocatalytic hydrogen production, where the light-absorbing semiconductor is in the form of powder, and photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, where the light-absorbing semiconductor is in the form of a thin film (either smooth or nanostructured) forming an electrode which is coupled to a counter-electrode through an external electric circuit.2 (Photocatalytic hydrogen generation may also refer more generally to hydrogen generation by e.g., splitting of HX (X = Cl, Br) and/or use of homogeneous organo-metallic complex catalysts,3 and clean fuels other than hydrogen can be produced by, for example, photocatalytic CO2 reduction,4 but we restrict discussion in this review to heterogeneous photocatalysis of water splitting to produce hydrogen.)
Compared with other solar-assisted hydrogen production approaches, such as a photovoltaic + water electrolyzer (PV–E) system which consists of two separate parts – the photovoltaic modules and the electrolyzer, PEC and photocatalytic (PC) water splitting potentially offer a simpler and cheaper approach because they only require integration of the photoabsorber with the catalyst, and energy conversion from solar to chemical energy is direct, rather than the conversion going via electrical energy as in the case of PV–E.5,6 In addition, they provide the capability to produce hydrogen and oxygen from water continuously without needing a charging process (i.e., unlike a battery-powered system). As a consequence, hydrogen can be produced as long as water and sunlight are supplied. Thus, having high catalytic activity in an efficient solar-absorbing semiconductor is a promising route to directly convert solar energy into hydrogen (i.e., solar hydrogen), simultaneously generating a versatile clean fuel and a valuable chemical feedstock.
PEC and PC technologies are at low technological readiness level (TRL) compared with PV–E,5 so their costs are difficult to estimate, but potential costs have been estimated at ∼$11 per kg H2 for PEC water splitting6,7 and as low as ∼$1.60 per kg H2 for PC water splitting,7 compared with ∼$12 per kg H2 for PV–E6 (assuming a solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 10% in all cases). For further discussion of the benefits, costs and limitations of the various methods of hydrogen generation, we refer the reader to the various comprehensive reviews that have been published previously.6,8–10
While there are many similarities between photocatalytic and PEC water splitting, PEC offers certain advantages, such physical separation of the O2 and H2 products, thus preventing the back-reaction. Also, costs of PEC could be reduced through future work, such as development of light-absorbing semiconductor materials that can give higher efficiencies, such that PEC may become economically competitive with PC and able to meet US Department of Energy targets for cost of hydrogen.7 Finally, much research in the field focuses on PEC rather than PC, as it offers advantages in terms of e.g., operando characterization and hence development of understanding of the performance of new systems and materials,5 with the findings being applicable to both PEC and PC. Thus, the primary focus of this review is research on PEC but much of the discussion applies to both methods, and some results for novel concepts and materials applied in the context of PC are discussed.
The first demonstration of PEC water splitting by a single crystal TiO2 material in the early 1970s initiated research into this new way of producing hydrogen from sunlight.11 Since then, much effort has been devoted to developing new photoelectrode materials. Many types of materials such as organometallic compounds,12 inorganic materials,13 and metal oxides14,15 have been explored; however, only a few have been found that are able to provide sufficient photoactivity under visible-light irradiation, hence solar radiation.7 Some of the main challenges for current PEC technology are: (i) designing materials that can efficiently absorb the visible-light portion of the solar spectrum; (ii) achieving highly efficient separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs; (iii) minimizing losses during transport of charge carriers to the back contact/semiconductor–electrolyte interface; (iv) minimizing overpotentials for the hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions; (v) achieving long-term system operation; (vi) minimizing system costs. The first three challenges are related to the intrinsic properties of the photoabsorber material, while the other three are related to the overall design of the PEC system.
Up to the 1980's, oxide semiconductors (i.e., TiO2,16 Fe2O3,17etc.) dominated the research work and publications on photoactive materials for PEC water-splitting applications (Table 1) as non-oxide semiconductors, such as nitrides and chalcogenides, often suffer from limited stability and efficiency, and/or require complex fabrication methods. In 1984, Reber and Meier reported an earth-abundant non-oxide material (ZnS) that could efficiently produce hydrogen from light irradiation in various electrolyte solutions without any assistance from a Pt cocatalyst.18 Since then, other non-oxides have also shown promise.

This review aims to cover the recent progress in materials design, development and application of non-oxide semiconductors used as photoelectrodes for water splitting. We refer the reader to other excellent reviews on the general principles of PEC water splitting and development of semiconductor photoelectrodes, as well as those with a focus on specific topics such as nanostructures and heterostructures,13,14,24–27 2D materials,28,29 and protection against corrosion.30 The first section of our review briefly revises the fundamentals of PEC water splitting: electronic structure of the photoabsorber and its requirements in relation to the water-splitting reaction, electron–hole pair recombination, use of cocatalysts, and methods for assessing the overall system performance. The review then turns to discussing various photoactive non-oxide materials that have been proposed and investigated as photoelectrodes (or photocatalysts) for water splitting and several strategies that have been applied to improve their performance. Next, we discuss various ideas associated with improving the (photo)stability of non-oxides, including electrolyte selection, controlling the hole oxidative capacity and applying protective coatings. The potential of novel classes of non-oxide materials that may be applicable for water splitting are also discussed. Finally, a summary and outlook for non-oxide semiconductors for water splitting are provided.
2. A primer on the fundamentals of PEC water splitting
Photoelectrochemistry is the study of the relationship and integration between light and electrochemical systems; hence PEC water splitting involves using light incident on a semiconducting photoelectrode material in an electrochemical cell to drive the water-splitting redox reactions, in which a water molecule (H2O) is separated into oxygen (O2) and hydrogen (H2).
Engineering the chemical and physical properties of the photoabsorber material is critical for achieving a high solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency. This section will cover some of the key concepts related to PEC water splitting: (i) important requirements of the electronic structure of the photoabsorber material; (ii) charge transport and recombination; (iii) use of cocatalysts; (iv) methods for quantifying the overall system efficiency. These topics are covered in detail in many excellent publications on photoelectrochemical water splitting;2,31,32 here, we simply provide a brief overview of the key concepts.
2.1 Electronic structure requirements of photoabsorber materials for solar water splitting
The electronic properties of a semiconductor material are of great importance in determining its PEC performance. The two key aspects to consider in terms of the electronic structure are the band gap and the density of states (DOS).32 Under light irradiation at a photon energy similar to or greater than the band gap of the semiconductor material, electrons in the valence band are excited into the conduction band, forming holes in the valence band. These photogenerated electrons and holes are then available to conduct oxidation/reduction for the water-splitting reaction: 2H2O → 2H2 + O2, ΔE0 = E0cathode − E0anode = −1.23 V(1)To catalyze the water-splitting reaction, the conduction band edge of the semiconductor should be located at a potential slightly more negative than the hydrogen evolution potential (H+/H2, 0 V vs. NHE at pH 0), while the valence band edge should be more positive than the water oxidation potential (O2/H2O, 1.23 V vs. NHE). These requirements, in relation to both the DOS and the band structure of the semiconductor photoelectrode material, are illustrated in Fig. 1, and mean that the theoretical minimum band gap of a semiconductor to catalyze water splitting is 1.23 eV.
 Fig. 1  Ideal electronic structure (illustrated as both DOS and band structure) of a photoabsorber material for PEC water-splitting applications. Two different scales are shown: electrochemical potential relative to normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) at pH 0, as well as energy on the absolute vacuum scale (AVS). The redox potentials of the water-splitting reaction are indicated by the grey solid lines and the Fermi energy level is shown by the black dashed line. 
Overpotential losses (η) typically occur at each electrode during the water-splitting reaction.30 The magnitudes of these losses depend on the electrolyte (e.g., ionic conductivity), the electrode surface chemistry and the electrode–electrolyte interface (e.g., rate of charge transfer).31 As a result of these overpotential losses, the minimum potential required in practice to drive the water-splitting reaction is greater than 1.23 V, and has been typically recorded at around 1.4–1.9 V.32,33 This means that the minimum band gap of the semiconductor material used in PEC water splitting including all these overpotentials is considered to be about 2.0 eV.34,35 In order to maximize absorption of solar radiation, the band gap should be as close to this value as possible.
2.2 Charge separation, transport and recombination
Following photoexcitation, ideally the electrons and holes remain separated and are transported to the semiconductor surface and counter-electrode to take part in the redox reactions. The efficiency of charge separation and transport is influenced by factors such as carrier mobility, carrier concentration, and the dielectric constant of the semiconductor material, as well as the diffusion length of the carrier species relative to the distance the photoexcited charge carriers need to travel to reach the surface/back contact. To achieve a high efficiency, these factors should all be optimized to minimize the rate of losses to recombination. Extensive details on the physics of charge separation, transport and recombination can be found in other excellent reviews.36–39
In PEC water splitting, the rate of recombination will be influenced by whether the semiconductor band gap is direct or indirect, and the concentration of defects, which can act as traps or recombination sites. To help enhance charge separation and reduce recombination, an external or internal built-in electric field is often required to assist the separation of photoexcited electron–hole pairs (Fig. 2a) so as to, for instance, improve the solar-to-hydrogen conversion. This is achieved to some extent through the space-charge/Helmholtz layers which form at the semiconductor/liquid junction (SCLJ). For example, in the case of an n-type photoanode, band bending in the surface region of the semiconductor will promote hole transport to the surface and electron transport to the back contact, Fig. 2b. However, the need to further enhance charge separation has prompted researchers to explore other approaches, such as the use of heterostructures, in which the band alignment across the interface promotes charge separation, and ferroelectric materials that naturally possess a built-in field due to their spontaneous polarization;40 these approaches are discussed in Sections 3.5 and 5.4, respectively.

(b) Band diagram of the interface between an n-type semiconductor (as the photoanode) and electrolyte. Photogenerated electron–hole pairs are separated by the space-charge layer at the semiconductor/liquid junction (SCLJ) as indicated by the arrowheads. 
2.3 Cocatalysts
Cocatalysts are commonly used to provide highly active reaction sites, enhance the reaction kinetics and reduce reaction overpotentials, while they can also play a role in promoting charge separation.41 Cocatalysts can be used for both the proton reduction (at the cathode) and water oxidation (at the anode, see Fig. 3) reactions. Noble metals, such as Pt, are typically employed as effective cocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction because of their large work functions (and low Fermi levels), which enable them to trap electrons. Pt has the lowest activation energy for H2 evolution compared to other metals.42 Therefore, from an electro-catalytic perspective, Pt is the most suitable cocatalyst for the H2 evolution reaction. On the other hand, oxide cocatalysts, such as RuOx and CoOx, are typically used to enhance the oxygen evolution activity. For example, loading CoOx onto Zn2xGeO4−x−3yN2y (ZGON) has been shown to produce three times more O2 gas compared with pristine ZGON.43

2.4 Overall system efficiency
There are several ways to quantify the solar energy conversion performance of PEC systems, but some key parameters are the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE), overall solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency, and Faradaic efficiency (ηF).44 IPCE is defined as the photocurrent generated per incident photon as a function of the irradiated wavelength, while STH efficiency is the ratio of chemical energy produced in the form of hydrogen to the solar energy input. Faradaic efficiency is the ratio of the hydrogen generated to the total charge passed through the photoelectrode. In a well-designed PEC system, the Faradaic efficiency should be close to 100%, and the number of moles of hydrogen gas generated should be twice the number of moles of oxygen gas, with the amounts of both gases being proportional to the total electrical current density flowing through the external circuit. However, during the redox reaction, losses might occur due to photoexcited electrons being wasted as heat and/or used to form other chemical products through side reactions. Failure to attain a hydrogen-to-oxygen ratio of 2:1 is classed as a Faradaic loss.45,46
3. Non-oxide photoactive materials for PEC water splitting
Having considered the fundamentals of PEC water splitting, our focus now turns to the central topic of this review, namely non-oxide photoactive materials. Non-oxide semiconductors possess promising intrinsic characteristics as photoactive materials, especially for hydrogen generation. For example, it has been shown that a suspension of ZnS particles has the ability to photochemically generate hydrogen.18 The amount of hydrogen produced by ZnS in the study by Reber and Meier reached a satisfactory efficiency (90% quantum yield) in sodium sulfite solution. Further, using the expensive redox cocatalyst Pt did not play any significant role in enhancing hydrogen generation by the ZnS,18 unlike the case of most oxide semiconductors. However, it is known that ZnS suffers from anodic photocorrosion, which involves the formation of sulfur and/or sulfate ions.47,48 Another issue with ZnS is that, due to its wide band gap (3.6 eV), the visible-light absorption is very low, meaning that the photochemical reaction under visible-light irradiation, and hence solar irradiation, is inefficient.49,50
To address the limitations of non-oxide materials, several strategies have been developed over the past few decades based on both experimental and computational approaches. These have included: (1) exploration of various non-oxide photoactive material compositions; (2) controlling the morphology and forming nanostructures of the materials; (3) band gap modification and electronic structure control; (4) surface modification through the use of a cocatalyst; (5) interface engineering through heterojunction formation. These approaches have led to significant advances in the overall PEC water splitting performance of non-oxide semiconductors under visible light.
3.1 Photoactive non-oxide semiconductors
There are many possible non-oxides that may be useful for PEC water splitting, including sulfides, selenides, nitrides and oxynitrides. Fig. 4 shows the band gaps and band edge potentials, relative to the redox potentials of the water-splitting reaction, for some of these materials. Due to the alignment of their band energies relative to the water-splitting redox potentials, many non-oxide materials are only suitable for driving one of the half-reactions. For example, as shown in Fig. 4, both Si and GaP have valence band potentials more negative (at potentials of 0.45 V and 1.1 V relative to NHE, respectively) than the water oxidation potential, which means they can only be applied as photocathodes in tandem devices.

The proton reduction (black dashed line) and water oxidation (red dashed line) potentials are indicated. Values of self-oxidation (red bars) and self-reduction (black bars) potentials are also shown.

High photocurrent generation is one of the key requirements for a high-performing PEC water splitting system. Several binary non-oxide materials have been reported for PEC water splitting that are able to reach high photocurrent densities as summarized in Table 2, including Cu2S (7 mA cm−2),52 Sb2Se3 (30 mA cm−2),53 GaP (10.9 mA cm−2),54 InP (25.5 mA cm−2)55 and CdTe (24.5 mA cm−2),56,57 which have shown potential as visible-light active photocathodes, and ZnS (1.5 mA cm−2),58 Ta3N5 (12.1 mA cm−2),59 CdSe (0.2 mA cm−2),60 GaAs (14.3 mA cm−2)61 and CdS (1.2 mA cm−2),62 which are promising materials for photoanodes. Elemental Si can reach a similar level of performance when used as either a photoanode (39 mA cm−2) or photocathode (38.5 mA cm−2).63 In recent years, attention has shifted from binary to ternary and quarternary compositions, where the much larger compositional space provides more possibilities for materials that can meet the requirements of PEC water splitting;64 some promising photocathode materials and their reported photocurrents include GaxIn1−xP (∼9 mA cm−2), GaxAs1−xP (∼4.5 mA cm−2),65,66 Cu(InGa)Se2 (CIGS, 32.5 mA cm−2)67 and Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS, 17 mA cm−2).68

The inability of photoelectrodes to achieve their theoretical maximum photocurrents could be due to a range of factors, including a high internal recombination rate (e.g., due to the presence of crystal defects and/or low intrinsic carrier mobility or lifetime), high overpotential losses and incomplete light absorption.5 Another intrinsic factor that needs to be resolved is the band gap of the photoactive material. For semiconductors with a band gap of ∼2.5 eV, the theoretical maximum achievable photocurrent is 10 mA cm−2 under sunlight irradiation.95 Semiconductor materials, such as GaN, ZnS, and ZnSe, that have wide band gaps (band gaps ∼3.0 eV or larger) will have low sensitivity to photons in the visible-light region and hence low photocurrent generation under sunlight. Indirect band gaps, as found for example for GaP, are also undesirable for light absorption.
In addition to the intrinsic characteristics of photoactive materials, external factors such as the composition of the electrolyte can affect the photocurrent and amount of hydrogen generated. For example, the performance of a CIGS photocathode was measured at pH levels of 1, 7, and 9; a pH of 9 was found to give the best performance due to it providing the most favorable band bending, while a pH of 1 caused significant photocorrosion.67
A common problem with non-oxide semiconductors is that the self-corrosion reaction is thermodynamically more favorable (i.e., less energetic) than the hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions.5 When corrosion (or photocorrosion) processes occur in PEC cells, the photoactive material is progressively degraded and dissolved into the electrolyte, leading to a loss of photocurrent over time.5,96,97 The self-oxidation and self-reduction potentials of some semiconductors are given in Fig. 4. For materials that suffer from poor stability, either loading a substantial amount of cocatalyst or introducing a protective layer on the material is required to deactivate the self-oxidation/reduction process to some degree. However, this increases the system complexity by combining multiple semiconductors and/or other materials. These approaches are discussed in Section 4.
3.2 Morphology control and nanostructuring
In addition to careful selection of materials based on their intrinsic properties, optimizing the material fabrication is required before implementing them into a PEC system. For example, the morphology and crystal structure of ZnS films have been reported to affect the optical properties of the film and thus influence the photocurrent generated by the photoelectrodes. For instance, a ZnS film in the zinc blende structure with a relatively smooth surface recorded less than half the photocurrent compared to a film of similar thickness with the wurtzite structure and a higher surface area.82 Similarly, a photoelectrode formed from exfoliated 2D SnS2 single layers (i.e., each layer consisting of one S–Sn–S trilayer) was reported to show over 70 times improvement in photocurrent density (at λ > 420 nm), reaching 2.7 mA cm−2 at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, compared to bulk SnS2.98 This was attributed to the large specific area and highly disordered surface atomic structure of the ultrathin SnS2 single layers, which enabled greatly increased visible-light absorption and fast transport of charges to the surface.98
Selective exposure of specific crystal facets can also be used to enhance PEC performance. For example, theoretical work has shown that the energy barrier for water splitting on Ta3N5 depends on the surface facet. The (110) surface possesses a lower energy barrier than the other surface facets, due to the easy migration of adsorbed H atoms from surface Ta to nearby N atoms.99 This effect of surface facets was attributed to the distinct local atomic environments (e.g., coordination numbers) found on different facets. In other words, by tuning the exposed crystal facets, the electronic and optical properties, and surface chemistry, can also be modified.100,101 As another example, CdS {0001} facets are known to have higher surface energy than other facets, making them more reactive for hydrogen production.102–104 By varying the proportion of {0001} to {001} facets, it was found, as expected, that CdS nanoplates with the largest exposed area of {0001} facets exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity, even when compared to other nanostructures such as nanocones and nanofrustums.105
Textured GaP films integrated on Si substrates have been studied in terms of their surface energies and facets for water-splitting applications. The deposited GaP films showed {114} faceting; such a textured surface is expected to benefit water-splitting applications by providing a large exposed surface area and light trapping.106 Other non-oxide materials such as Cu2S107 and GaN108 have also exhibited some dependency of the photoelectrochemical properties on their exposed facets.
Assembling material blocks into ordered patterns in a controlled way at the nanoscale to create fascinating morphologies offers another advantageous route to enhancing the active surface area of a material, and hence the available active sites at which the redox reactions can occur.27 Fabrication of nanostructures of various materials, including metals,109–111 oxides,112,113 and sulfides,114,115 have been reported in recent years. These nanostructures can be produced using deposition techniques including vapor phase transport, pulsed layer deposition, and chemical vapor deposition.109–115 Various nanostructures, including TaON nanospheres116 and nanoflowers,117 Ta3N5 nanograins,118 nanoporous films,69 and nanotubes,119 ZnS nanowires50 and nanobelts,120 ZnS–MoS2 core–shell nanostructures,121 one-dimensional CdS nanostructures,122 and CdS quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 nanostructures,123 have been fabricated and demonstrated enhanced photoactivity compared with their bulk counterparts.
Nanostructuring materials can also enhance light absorption and charge transport, and reduce recombination. In a planar film structure with a smooth surface, much of the incident light can be directly reflected by the flat film surface as shown in Fig. 5a. This significantly reduces light penetration into the film and, thus, photoexcited carrier generation. In addition, to obtain high light absorption (>90%), the thickness of the film should be at least 2.3 times the light penetration depth value (i.e., the distance at which the intensity of the incident light has decayed by 1/e),13 but such a thick film means that the photogenerated charge carriers must travel a long distance to reach the reaction sites. As the generated photoexcited carriers have a finite charge mobility and lifetime, this distance may be greater than the carrier diffusion length, which will increase the probability of recombination.124 In contrast, for a nanostructured film, the incident light is partially scattered from the rough surface of the film (Fig. 5b), thus increasing light absorption. For example, in contrast to planar structures, periodic nanowire arrays enable almost 100% light absorption across all incident wavelengths, as well as decreased loss of light by reflection due to their lower average refractive index.54 Further, the charge transport distance to the reaction sites is significantly decreased in nanostructures, since charges can reach the surface by migrating perpendicular to the film thickness direction, thus increasing the chance for the photogenerated charges to be used in the redox reactions before they recombine.27 For example, Fig. 6a shows a GaP nanowire array with the wurtzite crystal structure grown by nanoimprint lithography. The photocurrent generated by the nanowire array was ∼5.6 mA cm−2, which is nearly five times higher than the photocurrent generated by a planar GaP single crystal, as illustrated in Fig. 6b.54 Similarly, a nanoporous Ta3N5 film (Fig. 6c) has been reported to produce a photocurrent density approximately three times higher than a dense Ta3N5 film (Fig. 6d).69 The open structure of the nanoporous film provided a shorter transport pathway allowing the photogenerated holes to reach the SCLJ before recombining with the electrons, in contrast to the bulk Ta3N5 film. Simultaneous consideration and engineering of nanostructure dimensions and material characteristics, such as charge carrier diffusion length, is essential for optimizing performance; for example, it was found that the performance of Ta3N5 nanorods could be improved by various strategies such as Ba doping (which increased the carrier lifetime and diffusion length), optimization of fabrication conditions to suppress oxygen impurities and hence increase carrier lifetime, and ensuring that the nanorod diameter is smaller than the carrier diffusion length.79

3.3 Band engineering
To improve the overall photoactivity of a semiconductor material, it is necessary to study and tune the electronic structure. Atomic doping, forming solid solutions and/or intentionally introducing defects can be used to achieve some useful properties, such as efficient charge separation and transport, modified overpotentials for controlling the redox reaction kinetics and reduced band gap (hence enhanced visible-light absorption).125,126 These approaches have been applied to various non-oxide PEC photoelectrodes,48,80,81,127–131 with some key examples given in Fig. 7. Fig. 7a shows band gap modification of a Cd1−xZnxS solid solution. By increasing the Zn content, the conduction band minimum was raised, hence increasing the driving force for reduction albeit at the cost of increasing the band gap and thus decreasing visible-light absorption, while the valence band edge remained nearly constant. The band structure for all compositions straddled the water redox potentials.132 The optimum Zn content, at which the opposing effects of raising the conduction band and increasing the band gap are balanced, was estimated in this study to be ∼0.5.132 These theoretical results are consistent with the experimental observation that a Cd0.44Zn0.56S alloy had a 33 times higher photocatalytic H2 evolution rate than CdS at λ ≥ 420 nm. This was attributed to the more negative potential of the conduction band of Cd0.44Zn0.56S, which allowed more efficient hydrogen generation.133Fig. 7b shows that, by controlling the Cu and In content of a (CuIn)xZn2(1−x)S2 solid solution, the effective band gap could be narrowed (compared to pure ZnS) to 1.5 eV. The presence of discrete energy levels formed by Cu and In, particularly in the (CuIn)0.2Zn1.6S2 compound, enabled efficient charge separation and resulted in high photoactivity under visible-light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm).134

Adding transition metal elements as dopants in ZnS has been shown in a computational study to modify the effective band gap, as shown in Fig. 7c.135 Ni doping of ZnS in particular was predicted to enable visible-light absorption by lowering the effective band gap to 2.04 eV for a dopant concentration of 12.5 at%, while maintaining appropriate valence and conduction band potentials for water splitting. These predicted band gap modifications agree well with experimental observations. In one study, a relatively low concentration of Ni in ZnS (i.e., Zn0.999Ni0.001S) gave a reduced band gap of 2.3 eV due to the energy transition from the Ni 3d level to the conduction band of ZnS, leading to the absorption of photons at wavelengths down to 540 nm.136 Other work has shown 35 times higher emission intensity in the visible-light region for Co-doped ZnS than undoped ZnS.137 It has correspondingly been found that doping with either Ni or Co can increase the photoactivity of ZnS under visible-light irradiation compared with pure ZnS.136,137
Non-metals can also be used as dopants to tune the band gap. Shifting of the valence band due to the introduction of a new energy state from the N dopant in N-doped ZnS resulted in a band gap of 1.4 eV, which corresponded to enhanced visible-light absorption relative to pristine ZnS.48 Furthermore, the presence of crystal defects in ZnS (i.e., Zn interstitials or vacancies) has been reported to introduce mid-gap states above the valence band, which should allow light absorption at energies of 2.5 eV and 1.8 eV, for interstitials and vacancies respectively.58
As well as enhancing visible-light absorption, mid-gap states in the electronic structure, arising from the introduction of dopants or defects, can serve as trap states, and thus can play a role in reducing the electron–hole recombination rate and increasing the photocurrent and overall PEC efficiency. For example, Ag has been shown to be an effective dopant in CuGaSe2 (CGSe) that can significantly increase the generated photocurrent by increasing the hole lifetime.5,35,95 However, mid-gap states can also act as recombination centers, so controlling the concentration of dopants and defects, and their state, through the synthesis and post-treatment conditions is crucial. For example, 1% of Cu2+ incorporated into In1.4Zn0.9S3 has been reported to broaden the range of absorbed wavelengths, due to the presence of the Cu 3d donor level. This provides a relatively low-energy transition from the impurity level to the conduction band of In1.4Zn0.9S3.138 The wider absorption range means that more charge carriers can be generated, resulting in enhanced photoactivity particularly at visible-light wavelengths compared with the undoped material. However, at a higher concentration, Cu2+ can act as a recombination center, leading to lower photoactivity, while a lower Cu2+ concentration has no effect on photoactivity.
Rather than doping materials uniformly, gradients in dopant concentration can be used; compared with uniform doping, this approach offers the advantage of producing gradients in band energies to promote charge separation and transport. For example, doping Mg into a Ta3N5 photoanode with a concentration gradient (higher concentration at the electrode back contact, no Mg at the electrode surface) produced gradients in the valence and conduction bands that promoted drift of holes towards the semiconductor–electrolyte interface and electrons towards the electrode contact.139 The higher concentration of Mg deeper in the Ta3N5 film also passivated deep defects such as N vacancies that tended to occur in that part of the film due to the nitridation fabrication process. As a result of these effects, the graded Mg-doped Ta3N5 electrode produced a photocurrent of 8.5 mA cm−2, with an applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of 3.25%, compared with 7.3 mA cm−2 and 2.87% for a homogeneously doped electrode and 7.0 mA cm−2 and 1.37% for an undoped electrode.
3.4 Surface modification using cocatalysts
As discussed in Section 2, loading a metal or other cocatalyst on a photoelectrode surface to facilitate charge separation and enhance photocurrent generation can contribute significantly to achieving a high efficiency during PEC water splitting.41 Using a cocatalyst can also help improve the reaction kinetics and reduce overpotentials as well as suppress the self-oxidation and self-reduction of photoactive materials.59 In particular, the water oxidation reaction is slow on most photoelectrode surfaces due to the involvement of four electrons in the process.
Pt, MoS2, and RuO2 are examples of materials that are widely used as cocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction.140 For instance, the addition of 5 nm-sized Pt cocatalyst particles on GaP nanowires resulted in a high photocurrent density of ∼10 mA cm−2 (compared with 1.5 mA cm−2 with no cocatalyst), which corresponds to 80% of the theoretical limit for GaP.54 Earth-abundant non-oxide cocatalysts can also be used. In the same study of GaP nanowires, MoSx was found to improve the photocurrent density from 4.1 mA cm−2 (for nanowires with no catalyst) to 6.4 mA cm−1.2,54 MoSe2 was recently reported to be an effective cocatalyst when deposited on the surface of ZnS, facilitating charge transfer and providing more reactive sites.141
For the oxygen evolution reaction, various cocatalysts including Ni(OH)x, CoOx, Co(OH)2, CoOOH, CoPi, and Fe–Co–Ni-based compounds have been extensively investigated to enhance the reaction kinetics and/or reduce the potential barriers of photoanodes.59,75,142–145 Selected results for Ta3N5 photoanodes are shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 8a shows that a Ni(OH)x cocatalyst, used in conjunction with a ferrihydrite hole-storage layer (HSL) at the Ta3N5/co-catalyst interface, led to an enhanced photocurrent density of 7.8 mA cm−2 with nearly 100% IPCE at ∼430 nm. This was attributed to the role of the HSL in extracting charge carriers and transferring them to the Ni(OH)x cocatalyst (Fig. 8b and c).59 As another example, using a Co(OH)2 cocatalyst on Ta3N5 photonanodes synthesized under a reducing atmosphere (Ar/H2) pushed the generated photocurrent density to 11 mA cm−2,143 as shown in Fig. 8d and e, which is close to the theoretical limit of 12.9 mA cm−2.59 These photoanodes exhibited a strong hole extraction ability and facilitated the interfacial transfer of holes, resulting in an IPCE of ∼50% at 450 nm (Fig. 8f). This represents an approximately five-fold increase compared to the Ta3N5 photoanodes without a cocatalyst at the same wavelength. Nanostructured Ta3N5 photoanodes combined with a Co3O4/Co(OH)2 cocatalyst showed a photocurrent density of 6 mA cm−2 with a maximum IPCE of 39.5% at 440 nm. The IPCE was almost eight times higher compared to the Ta3N5 nanorods without a cocatalyst (Fig. 8g–i).144 This was attributed to the interaction between the Ta3N5 and the Co3O4/Co(OH)2 bilayer cocatalyst promoting efficient transfer of photogenerated charges across the interfaces and inhibiting recombination. Through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements, it was shown that the interface between the Co3O4/Co(OH)2/Ta3N5 photoanode and the electrolyte had a lower resistance than for Ta3N5, Co(OH)2/Ta3N5, and Co3O4/Ta3N5, which corresponded to the enhanced charge transfer kinetics.

Coating a photoanode formed from CdS nanoflakes with a CdIn2S4 catalytic layer was also reported to enhance the photocurrent density and solar conversion efficiency.146 The In3+ ions in the CdIn2S4 coating layer acted as catalytic sites, promoting hole consumption for driving the water oxidation reaction. Consequently, a high photocurrent density 5.5 mA cm−2 at 1 V (vs. RHE) was obtained, almost 100% higher than for the CdS nanoflake photoanode without the CdIn2S4 layer. The solar-conversion efficiency for CdS–CdIn2S4 was around four times higher than for bare CdS. Other highly promising photoanode materials can also be significantly improved by engineering the surface using cocatalysts, such as SrTaO2N,147 BaNbO2N,148 SrNbO2N,148 GaN,149 CdIn2S4,150 and LaTaON2.151
Placing a cocatalyst layer on a photoelectrode is not only limited to affecting the catalytic activity, it is also expected to affect performance stability, as discussed in Section 4.
3.5 Heterojunctions
Utilizing single materials has been explored in many ways, but combining two different materials can unlock new paths for further development of highly active photoelectrodes.35,152,153 By combining two or more materials in a heterostructure, it is possible to form a suitable band alignment that is favorable for driving the water oxidation and reduction reactions under visible-light irradiation as well as separating photogenerated charges more efficiently than is possible with a single material.153 For example, Zhang et al. reported that surface modification of ZnS nanosheets with CuS clusters leads to significantly higher visible-light activity for photocatalytic hydrogen generation than for pure ZnS or a physical mixture ZnS and CuS particles.154 An absorption shoulder was observed in the UV-visible spectrum, ascribed to a photoinduced interfacial charge transfer (IFCT) of electrons from the valence band of ZnS to the CuS, as shown in Fig. 9a. In this case the band alignment at the CuS/ZnS interface facilitated photoexcited electron and hole separation, reducing the recombination rate. In a similar vein, in a heterojunction between boron-doped carbon nitride (B-C3N4) and Mo-doped BiVO4 (Mo-BiVO4), the work function tuning caused by the B-doping of C3N4 significantly enhanced the charge separation of the electron–hole pairs at the B-C3N4/Mo-BiVO4 interface under illumination.155 In addition to the Mo-doping of BiVO4 and use of a NiFeOx cocatalyst, which both contributed to reducing the onset potential, this resulted in an applied bias photon-to-current efficiency of 2.67% at 0.54 V (vs. RHE), higher than for any previously-reported BiVO4-based photoanode. Similarly, a Cd0.5Zn0.5S/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst showed a much higher rate of photocatalytic hydrogen production under visible light than either Cd0.5Zn0.5S or g-C3N4 on their own (up to 20.8 mL h−1 compared with 13.6 mL h−1 and negligible hydrogen production for Cd0.5Zn0.5S and g-C3N4 respectively), attributed to the rapid separation of electrons and holes due to the band alignment across the interface.156 For the CdIn2S4-coated CdS nanoflake photoanodes discussed in Section 3.4, as well as providing a catalytically active surface layer, the CdIn2S4 layer also formed a favorable band alignment with the CdS to promote charge separation across the interface, and this effect also contributed to the enhanced photocurrent.146 The p–n junction formed between In2S3 and CuInS2 (with Pt as a reduction cocatalyst) was found to give significantly better PEC performance as a photocathode (5.6 mA cm−2 photocurrent, half-cell STH efficiency of 0.7%) than CuInS2 on its own (1.0 mA cm−2 photocurrent, half-cell STH efficiency of 0.05%) due to the band-bending at the junction promoting efficient charge separation.157 As another example, an STH efficiency of ∼16% has been reported for a GaInP/GaInAs heterojunction, with a relatively good photostability (15% decay after 1 hour operation time) and a photocurrent density of 13.2 mA cm−2.158

Copyright 2014, American Chemical Society). 
For silicon-based junctions, a photocurrent of 33 mA cm−2 (with an onset potential of 0.64 V) was reported for an amorphous Si/crystalline Si heterojunction photoelectrode.159 This high photocurrent was attributed to good surface passivation of the hydrogenated amorphous Si and low recombination losses, which resulted in a STH conversion efficiency of 13%. A similar observation was also found when an amorphous Si layer was used as a coating layer on a n-Si photoelectrode to form a double-sided Si photoelectrode.63 High photocurrents of ∼39 mA cm−2 were achieved when it was used as either a photocathode or photoanode, while a STH efficiency of 3.7% was achieved when it was used with a BiVO4 photoanode for unbiased water splitting. The surface passivation provided by the amorphous Si layer resulted in an ultra-long minority carrier diffusion length and hence a low recombination rate.
Heterojunctions formed by combining non-oxide and oxide materials may also result in the same benefits. Fig. 9b shows that, in a CdS/TiO2/Ni nanocomposite, electrons can be quickly transferred from the conduction band of CdS to that of TiO2 and then to the Ni cocatalyst to produce hydrogen.160 The fast electron transfer to the TiO2 conduction band results in enhanced electron–hole separation and a low recombination rate, while also preventing reduction of the Cd2+. Using multiple heterojunctions in a ZnO/ZnS/CdS/CuInS2 core–shell nanowire array resulted in a high photocurrent density of 10.5 mA cm−2 with an IPCE of 57.7% at 480 nm.161 The p–n junction formed by CdS/CuInS2 within the structure was important for promoting the separation and transport of charge carriers, while the ZnS layer passivated the ZnO surface states to reduce the recombination, and ZnO as the core of the structure provided the electron transport pathway.

Fig. 10 shows that forming a p–n junction on GaP photocathodes (i.e., p-GaP/n-Nb2O5/Pt) gives a photocurrent density of 1 mA cm−2 (solid green lines) with an enhanced photostability compared to p-GaP as well as a higher open-circuit voltage (0.4 V for p-GaP vs. 0.7 V for p-GaP/n-Nb2O5/Pt relative to RHE, solid red lines) due to the asymmetric potential drop distribution across the junction.162 However, the photocurrent was low (compared with the theoretical limit of 12.5 mA cm−2), attributed to the low light absorption coefficient and correspondingly long absorption length, due to the indirect nature of the GaP band gap, paired with a relatively short diffusion length.

Similar to the doping and solid solution approaches discussed in Section 3.3, heterostructures also provide an avenue for band gap engineering and enhancing visible-light absorption. For example, films consisting of alternating layers of ZnS and GaP have shown a systematic improvement in the photocurrent generated under visible-light irradiation as the number of ZnS–GaP interfaces increases.83 This was attributed to the presence of new electronic states associated with the unique local atomic bonding environments at the interfaces. Under visible-light illumination (λ ≥ 435 nm), the multilayer films could generate a photocurrent of 4.4 μA cm−2 at 1.0 V bias, while a pure ZnS film of the same thickness offered negligible photocurrent.
Despite these successes, combining materials in heterojunctions requires more work, as there are many possible combinations of materials to explore that can be applicable for PEC systems.
4. Challenges for non-oxide photoelectrodes
As discussed above, promising non-oxide material candidates used alongside suitable modification strategies are capable of generating high photocurrents even at visible-light wavelengths. However, their stability (i.e., susceptibility to (photo)corrosion) continues to be a limitation to the practical application of many non-oxide semiconductors. To further develop photoelectrodes for PEC devices for water-splitting applications, the next crucial step is to optimize the (photo)stability of the electrodes to achieve minimum degradation of the photoactive material. There are multiple strategies to mitigate (photo)corrosion that can be applied, including finding suitable electrolytes to drive the water-splitting redox reactions, reducing hole oxidative capacity, and applying protective coatings. With these strategies, there have been further developments towards producing non-oxide photoelectrodes with high photostability.163
4.1 Electrolyte selection
Direct contact between the photoelectrode and the electrolyte in a PEC cell is inevitable and the photoabsorber material is expected to suffer from some level of degradation. Thus, finding a favorable electrolyte in which the photoabsorber material can both produce a high photocurrent and remain stable, at least over a sufficient lifetime for practical applications, is required. Although researchers have investigated PEC water splitting using non-oxide semiconductors in the presence of various electrolytes, such as H2SO4, Na2SO4, KCl, Na2S and NaOH (see Table 2), specific and systematic studies on the photoactivity and stability of photoabsorber materials in different electrolytes remain very limited.164,165 However, it is rational to try to avoid undesirable oxidation and reduction pathways by examining the effect of the electrolyte cation and anion species on photostability. For the In2S3–CuInS2 p–n junction photocathodes discussed in Section 3.5, performance and stability were found to be better in a phosphate electrolyte compared with a sulfate electrolyte, due to passivation of surface defects by phosphate ions and suppression of chemical bias due to phosphate preventing the accumulation of OH− ions.166 In the phosphate electrolyte, 92% of the current was maintained after 1 h of PEC operation, compared with 44% in the sulfate electrolyte, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed a significant decrease in charge transfer efficiency over this measurement period in the sulfate, but not the phosphate, electrolyte.
Other species that may be present in an electrolyte, such as dissolved gases, may also be important. Investigations on the effect of dissolved oxygen on photocorrosion have provided varied results with substantial ongoing debate in this area. Some studies have shown a decrease in the overall PEC/photocatalytic efficiency and stability with increased dissolved oxygen concentration,167 while other studies have shown either an improvement168 or no noticeable effects169 due to a greater dissolved oxygen presence. Further insight into the roles of ions and other species in an electrolyte is highly desired for providing a new strategy to reduce the photocorrosion of non-oxide materials through the proper choice of electrolyte (i.e., ion species and concentration).
4.2 Hole oxidative capacity
One reason why non-oxide materials tend to corrode more easily than oxides is that the driving force for self-oxidation is often stronger than the driving force for water oxidation, whereas the reverse is true for many oxides. Fig. 11 provides a comparison of valence band edge location and self-oxidation potential relative to the H2O oxidation potential for TiO2, ZnO and ZnS. When ZnS is used as a photocathode, protons can be readily reduced to produce hydrogen due to the favorable thermodynamics. The standard proton reduction potential, located at 0.0 V (vs. NHE), is significantly more positive than the ZnS conduction band level and more positive than the self-reduction potential of ZnS. However, the self-oxidation potential of ZnS (∼0.3 V vs. NHE) is more negative than the water oxidation potential (1.23 V vs. NHE). This indicates that the photogenerated holes have a strong capacity for oxidizing ZnS and thus causing photocorrosion. The same is true for many other non-oxide semiconductors (see Fig. 4), whereas many oxides have a self-oxidation potential that is more positive than the water oxidation potential (e.g., TiO2) or at least closer to the water oxidation potential than most non-oxides (e.g., ZnO).

Thus, to improve the photostability of sulfide photoelectrodes, it may be necessary to add a suitable hole scavenger to the electrolyte, such as SO32− or SO42−.170 However, it is more appealing to improve the intrinsic stability. This may be achieved by either controlling the valence band states or promoting rapid transfer of the photogenerated holes to avoid oxidation of the lattice anions. For example, the photocorrosive behavior of ZnS was reported to be reduced by nitrogen doping, attributed to the nitrogen dopant raising the valence band edge of ZnS and reducing the oxidative capability of holes in the valence band, as well as increasing the efficiency of charge separation.48 The nitrogen-doped ZnS demonstrated stable operation for 12 hours of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under simulated sunlight irradiation. In contrast, severe corrosion of undoped ZnS occurred within five hours of use.48
The strategies discussed in Sections 3.4 and 3.5, of combining two materials either to form a heterojunction or to add a cocatalyst to a photoelectrode, can enhance stability as well as improve performance, by promoting the rapid transfer and consumption of photogenerated holes. For example, in the Cd0.5Zn0.5S–C3N4 composite structure discussed in Section 3.5, the rapid transfer of photogenerated holes from the valence band of Cd0.5Zn0.5S to the coupled semiconductor (i.e., C3N4) not only promoted charge separation to enhance photoactivity but also prevented the accumulation of holes in the valence band of CdxZn1−xS, in turn inhibiting photocorrosion.156 When amorphous TiO2 as an oxidation cocatalyst and Ni(NO3)2 as a reduction cocatalyst were simultaneously integrated on the surface of a CdS photocatalyst, the photogenerated holes in the valence band of CdS were rapidly transferred to the TiO2 and consumed by the Na2SO3–Na2S scavenger.171 This resulted in suppression of the oxidation of lattice S2− ions and, consequently, the photostability of CdS was improved. Without any protective layer, the photocurrent of GaP photoanodes has been reported to decrease during operation (∼5% decay after ∼1 hour). Deposition of a nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH) layer as a cocatalyst delivered both a significant increase in photocurrent and increased stability (∼9% decay after >10 hours).172
Both InP and GaInP photocathodes have been found to undergo significant cathodic corrosion involving formation of metallic In0.65,173 This can be prevented by deposition of sparsely distributed Pt catalyst nanoparticles, with the Pt favoring hydrogen evolution rather than In3+ reduction and thus giving stable operation for >200 h for GaInP and > 285 h for InP, although pH-dependent physical degradation (e.g., surface morphology changes, electrode dissolution) did occur. Similarly, deposition of Pt islands on Si photocathodes has been reported to not only enhance the efficiency of H2 generation but also result in good stability, with a stable photocurrent maintained for 2 months.174
4.3 Protective layers
To avoid direct contact with the electrolyte, adding a protective layer to the photoelectrode surface is a promising strategy. There are several requirements for the material to be implemented as a protective layer.175–177 First, the layer should be electrically conducting and/or sufficiently thin so that it can transfer the photogenerated charge carriers to/from the electrolyte with minimal performance loss. Second, the layer should be optically transparent as it needs to provide the highest possible transmission of (visible) light to the photoelectrode. Third, the layer itself needs to be stable in contact with the electrolyte. Lastly, the layer should either be catalytically active itself or will need to be used in conjunction with a cocatalyst. In practice, protective layers generally experience some degradation themselves. As long as the rate is very slow, it may still allow sufficient long-term operation of the PEC device.178
Thin oxide layers are the most promising protective materials due to their chemical robustness, high transparency to visible light, and high conductivity. For example, InP-based photocathodes with a 4 nm-thick TiO2 protective layer have been reported to exhibit a stable photocurrent (i.e., 0% decay) for six hours compared with 60% decay within six hours without the protective layer, as shown in Fig. 12a.179 However, when the TiO2 layer thickness was increased to 20 nm, the efficiency of the photocathode was significantly lower, due to the additional resistance of the thick TiO2 layer.179 A similar observation was also reported on the stability of InP nanopillar photocathodes. A 5 nm-thick TiO2 layer with a Ru cocatalyst gave stable photocurrent generation for four hours, while the photocurrent significantly decreased after two hours without the TiO2 protection layer.180 There are also some other non-oxide semiconductors for which a TiO2 layer (or TiO2 combined with a metal cocatalyst) has been applied as a protective layer to improve the photostability, such as Si,181 GaInP2,182 CZTS,183 and Cu2BaSnS4.184
 Fig. 12  Photostability measurement results for (a) bare InP and TiO2-protected InP (TiO2/InP) (data taken from ref. 179); (b) bare GaInP2 and MoS2-protected GaInP2 (MoS2/GaInP2) (data taken from ref. 196). Error bars are included for each point to indicate the fluctuation of the recorded photocurrent during the measurement. 
While protective layers are usually in the thickness range of a few nanometers so they do not excessively increase resistance, applying a thicker 118 nm protective layer of unannealed TiO2 on GaP photoanodes (with a 2 nm layer of Ni metal also deposited as an oxidation catalyst) resulted in a stable photocurrent over more than 25 hours with close to 100% Faradaic efficiency.61 The amorphous TiO2 was defective and electronically “leaky”, thus allowing charges to be transported through it despite its relatively large thickness. Similarly thick (10's of nanometers) amorphous TiO2 layers were also shown to protect GaAs and Si photoanodes for more than 25 and 100 hours, respectively. However, these ALD-grown TiO2 films are prone to defects, pinholes and intermediate phases that can lead to pitting corrosion of the underlying photoactive layer.185,186 Reducing the film thickness, from 24 nm to 2.5 nm, to increase the nucleation barrier for formation of intermediate phases increased the period of stable photocurrent generation for a Si photoanode from 70 h to >500 h.186 However, since such defects cannot be entirely eliminated in practice, another approach to circumvent this issue with pitting corrosion is spatially isolating regions of the photoactive material such that defects and corrosion pits cannot propagate across the entire photoelectrode.185,187 For example, an array of GaAs nanowires coated with ∼100 nm of amorphous TiO2 was stable for 600 h of continuous operation with <12% decay in photocurrent.185 The good stability was attributed to the defect-tolerant design that isolates defects within discrete regions of the GaAs photoabsorber.185 Similarly, a 110 nm-thick amorphous TiO2 layer was found to effectively mitigate the corrosion of GaAs microislands (∼200 μm diameter).188 A small proportion (∼5%) of the microislands failed within the first 20 h of operation due to pre-existing defects and pinholes in the TiO2 coating, but the spatially-isolated nature of the microislands meant that these failures did not propagate and no significant further failure occurred until after ∼35 h of operation. This approach of depositing discrete, spatially isolated regions should be beneficial for other corrosion-susceptible photoelectrode materials that are coated with protective layers.
Oxides other than TiO2 can also offer effective protection. For the GaP nanowires discussed in Sections 3.2 and 3.4, electrochemical oxidation of the surface in combination with use of a Pt catalyst allowed stable operation for 5 hours; while still insufficient for commercial applications, this stability is better than generally achieved with III–V semiconductors without passivation.54 As another example, deposition of an AlOx dielectric layer and a CeOx layer was reported to result in a highly stable Ta3N5 photoanode. In combination with a ferrihydrite hole storage layer and a NiFeOx cocatalyst (as discussed in Section 3.4), the AlOx coating promoted charge separation and transfer to the cocatalyst, resulting in inhibition of photocorrosion and a stable photocurrent of 11.8 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE over 120 h.189 A spin-coated layer of NiFeOx providing complete coverage of Ta3N5 photoanodes was also found to provide good stability, although while oxidation of the Ta3N5 was prevented, the stability was limited by dissolution of Fe from the NiFeOx,190 suggesting that stabilizing the cocatalyst needs to be the focus of future work. ALD-grown films of CoOx or biphasic CoOx/Co(OH)2 have been found to stabilize Si photoanodes while also providing an active cocatalyst for water oxidation;191,192 for CoOx, the formation of compact, uniform films of adequate thickness (∼50 nm) resulted in few pinhole defects, while for biphasic CoOx/Co(OH)2, deposition at relatively low temperatures minimized these defects.
An interesting case is seen for Si photoelectrodes; while Si is prone to corrosion and needs a protective layer, interestingly it may self-passivate (depending on the electrolyte) by forming SiOx where there are any defects in the protective layer. This has resulted in stability for a period of over 1200 h of continuous operation for a Si photoanode coated with NiOx.193 However, Si electrodes can still corrode under dark conditions, and hence under a natural day–night cycle; this can be mitigated by addition of an oxidizing agent to the electrolyte to promote SiOx formation, with use of [Fe(CN)6]3− found to slow the etching rate of a Si photoanode by a factor of >180 and extend the lifetime to >280 h under a simulated day–night illumination cycle92 (compared with deterioration after 48 h and complete failure after 120 h without [Fe(CN)6]3−). Recent work showed that self-passivation of Si in the dark can also be catalyzed by Ni and NiOx protective films, in the presence of O2 and strongly alkaline electrolyte, giving stability over a period of >400 h under a simulated day–night illumination cycle.194
Selected non-oxide materials that exhibit high transparency to visible light, active catalytic properties and chemical inertness can also be implemented as protective layers.176 For instance, for the work on CdS nanoflake photoanodes discussed in Section 3.4, the photocurrent of the bare CdS nanoflake arrays was found to decay by 50% within 1.5 hours of irradiation time, whereas the incorporation of a 30 nm-thick protective layer of CdIn2S4 improved the photostability up to 10 hours with a decay of only 20%.146 This increased stability was attributed to the prevention of hole accumulation in the CdS, due to the same factors that contributed to the enhanced performance, i.e. the favorable band alignment at the heterojunction and the high catalytic activity of the CdIn2S4 layer. As another example, for InGaN/GaN core/shell nanowires, the thin (∼10–20 nm) GaN shell was found to protect the InGaN from photocorrosion, allowing stable photocurrent generation over a 10 hour period.195 Elemental analysis (i.e., energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) after 24 hours of PEC operation showed that there was no material degradation. A GaN coating was also found to increase the stability of a Ta3N5 photoanode.74 A stable photocurrent could be maintained over 10 hours (in comparison, the current decayed to zero when no GaN coating was used) but then gradually decayed over the next 40 hours; this decay was attributed to electrolyte penetration through pinholes in the GaN, allowing oxidation of the Ta3N5, suggesting that conformal deposition of GaN with no pinholes should give even better stability. GaInP2 has also shown a stable photocurrent for 60 hours without any current loss when coated with a 5 nm MoS2 layer. In contrast, a significant photocurrent decay for bare GaInP2 was clearly observed after only a few hours of irradiation time, as shown in Fig. 12b.196 An In2S3/CdS double layer was found to enhance the stability of CZTS photocathodes, with no significant decay in photocurrent occurring over a three hour measurement period, compared with almost complete decay in photocurrent when CdS was used without In2S3; however, a progressive decay in the Faradaic efficiency observed during H2 evolution measurement when using the double layer indicated that further optimization is still required.197
Finally, thin metallic coatings can also provide protection, with a ∼2 nm-thick layer of metallic nickel found to protect Si photoanodes, allowing ∼80 hours of stable PEC water oxidation, compared with severe corrosion of unprotected Si occurring within 24 hours.198 Like some other stabilizing coatings, the nickel had the additional benefit of acting as a cocatalyst for water oxidation. However, increasing the thickness of the Ni coating decreased the photocurrent, attributed to reduced light transmittance. The Schottky barrier height at the Ni/Si interface was found to depend on the Ni oxidation state, suggesting that controlled oxidation of metal/semiconductor junctions provides a route to tuning PEC activity as well as the charge carrier selectivity of such junctions.199
5. Exploration of new classes of non-oxide photoactive materials
The previous sections outline key challenges met by the community in the implementation of current non-oxide materials in PEC devices. Although non-oxides show good promise, there are nevertheless some intrinsic limitations that severely inhibit their performance. This has motivated the community to consider non-traditional candidate materials systems. We describe in this section some of these new classes of non-oxide materials that have recently been explored as photoelectrodes and photocatalysts. Our list of examples below is by no means exhaustive but simply showcases some of the exciting and wide variety of materials that show potential.
5.1 Conjugated polymers
Conjugated polymers are organic semiconductors that are composed of a polymeric backbone with alternating single and π bonds. They have versatile chemistries that allow tuning of the photon–electron behavior. Certain conjugated polymers possess suitable energy levels for water splitting while also exhibiting some other useful properties for photoelectrodes.200–205 For example, a wide absorption window (i.e., from 320 to 700 nm) with a maximum IPCE of ∼1% at 340 nm was shown by the conjugated polymer poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline), or pBBL, suggesting a good capability for visible-light harvesting.204
Although so far the photocurrent generation by conjugated polymer-based photoelectrodes is low (i.e., tens of μA cm−2), some strategies have been found useful to improve the photocurrent. For example, film morphology has been found to be important, with a rough, nanostructured film of pBBL found to produce a photocurrent higher, by a factor of 6.5, than a smooth film. Another way to increase the photocurrent generation is by tuning the composition of the electrolyte, with the photocurrent produced by pBBL found to increase with increasing pH, due to the increasing driving force for oxidation.204 Water oxidation was achieved with the pBBL photoanode after addition of a nickel–cobalt cocatalyst; a steady-state photocurrent ∼10 μA cm−2 was observed, corresponding to a Faradaic efficiency of 82 ± 16%.
As mentioned in Section 3.5, constructing a junction can be an effective strategy to improve the photocurrent generation, and this can equally be applied to conjugated polymers. For instance, poly(1,4-diethynylbenzene), or pDEB, has been used as a photocathode material for water reduction due to its low band gap.202 A graded junction fabricated by sequential copolymerization of DEB and TEB (1,3,5-triethynylbenzene) such that the composition varied through the film thickness as pDEB/p(DEB1−x–TEBx), where x = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, or 0.1 and progressively increased towards the film surface, showed an enhanced photocurrent response compared with pure pDEB and a pDEB homojunction with only one pDEB/p(DEB1−x–TEBx) composition. The composition gradient promoted charge separation due to the continuous band bending, resulting in an IPCE for the homojunction of 2.8% at 480 nm (compared with 1.7% for bare pDEB) and a Faradaic efficiency of ∼90% over a 13 hour period of PEC reaction.202
High-performance organic photoanodes were reported based on a heterojunction between a p-type polymer PBDB-T‡ and an n-type non-fullerene§ that could achieve a photocurrent density of ∼15 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V (vs. RHE), with a Faradaic efficiency close to 100%.97 The organic layer was encapsulated in Ni foil and GaIn eutectic, while a NiFe layered double hydroxide was applied to act as an oxygen evolution cocatalyst, as well as to maximize the charge separation efficiency and prevent photocorrosion. As a result, the photocurrent was stable for 10 h without any significant loss and a 4.3% STH efficiency was achieved.
Another approach is to combine organic and inorganic materials in a hybrid Z-scheme PEC cell. In one example of this type of system,206 an inorganic ZnO nanorod array was used as the photoanode with an organic poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid (P3HT:PCBM) photocathode. The system produced an average photocurrent of ∼95 μA cm−2 over a measurement period of ∼10 h, corresponding to a STH efficiency of 0.12%. Although the photocurrent and efficiency are low, the system was not optimized and demonstrates there is potential for such an organic-inorganic hybrid system to reach the same performance level as fully inorganic Z-scheme systems.
While developing conjugated polymers with high photocurrent generation remains a significant challenge, it offers a new avenue for high-performance photoelectrodes in the field of solar-to-fuel conversion.
5.2 Covalent organic frameworks (COFs)
COFs are crystalline polymers constructed from organic frameworks linked by covalent bonds. The versatility of the PEC properties of COFs is mainly driven by the structural and electronic characteristics of their building blocks. Appropriate building blocks with suitable linkers enable them to facilitate various redox reactions, including the water-splitting reaction.207 High stability in both acidic and basic electrolytes (and also in air) make the exploration of this class of material intriguing as photoelectrodes for water-splitting applications.203,205,208–210 For example, the PEC activity and photostability of a 2D COF formed by conjugated polyimine sheets, called BDT-ETTA, has been examined for photocathode applications.203 The BDT-ETTA was assembled from aromatic amine-functionalized tetraphenylethylene and thiophene-based dialdehydes, which were π-stacked in the third dimension to create a highly oriented COF film. The sample showed photoactivity in the visible-light wavelength region with a direct optical gap of 2.47 eV; a photocurrent up to 1.5 μA cm−2 in magnitude was generated under AM 1.5 simulated sunlight, with a maximum IPCE of ∼0.38% at 355 nm. The photostability of the BDT-ETTA sample was tested in different solvents across a pH range from 3 to 14; it showed excellent stability over 5 hours of illumination.
Addition of triphenylbenzene as an electron donor to a 2,4,6-triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine based COF has been found to promote charge transfer and enhance visible-light absorption.211 The optical band gap was narrowed from 2.67 eV to 2.43 eV, resulting in photocurrent generation (when the COFs were used as photocathodes for H2 evolution under visible light, λ ≥ 420 nm) increasing from 35 μA cm−2 to 110 μA cm−2, corresponding to an STH efficiency of 0.068%. Similarly, addition of β-ketene-cyano as a donor–acceptor pair has been found to lower exciton binding energy and increase charge carrier lifetime of COF nanosheets.212 An apparent quantum efficiency of 82.6% at 420 nm was achieved for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution using a Pt cocatalyst, with no decline in H2 production over 24 h, making it superior compared with both other COFs and conjugated polymers.
The flexible construction of COFs means that various functional groups can be added within the robust nanoporous structure of the crystalline solid, of which organic chromophores are of particular interest for PEC applications.208 Chromophores such as porphyrins213–215 and organic dyes216,217 have been used in many photochemical device applications. A recent review article has highlighted the challenges and opportunities of using organic chromophores for water-splitting applications.218 Utilizing chromophores for PEC water splitting can allow improvement and tuning of light absorption and help to maintain the photostability during the oxidation reaction in aqueous solutions. For instance, Eberhart et al. recently reported three different types of organic dye chromophores that show substantial promise for use in dye-sensitized PEC devices.219 These newly synthesized donor–acceptor organic dyes demonstrated high oxidizing potential, prolonged (∼1 hour) oxygen evolution under visible light and Faradaic efficiencies up to 82%. If such chromophores can be incorporated into COFs, the resulting composite would potentially have the structural flexibility of COFs coupled with the robust PEC performance of the chromophore. Selecting an appropriate functional group for the organic chromophore could potentially minimize the vulnerability to oxidative degradation and increase photostability.218 Thus, through various material combinations and appropriate strategies, COFs may provide a novel class of photoelectrodes with versatile properties for PEC applications in the near future.
5.3 Metal-free ceramics
Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) belongs to the class of polymeric semiconductor materials. It is composed of tri-s-triazine units and can be synthesized using various precursors, including urea, thiourea, cyanamide, melamine, and their mixtures.220 g-C3N4 has excellent characteristics and physicochemical properties for water-splitting applications including a simple manufacturing process, high thermal (up to 500 °C in air) and chemical stability (due to strong van der Waals forces between the layers) and long-term stability during hydrogen evolution (up to 72 hours).221 Its band edge positions are also suitable for the water-splitting redox reactions i.e., −1.1 V and +1.6 V (vs. NHE) for the conduction band and valence band, respectively. These properties make g-C3N4 a highly promising material candidate for water splitting.221 The main challenge is that the PEC activity of g-C3N4 remains limited by low photocurrent generation arising from a high recombination rate and weak visible-light absorption (i.e., wide band gap of ∼2.7 eV).
Thus, research on optimizing the reaction conditions during PEC operation,222,223 improving the photoactivity by doping,224–226 and accelerating the driving mechanism227–229 of g-C3N4 is ongoing. For example, introducing oxygen linkers and OH terminal groups in g-C3N4 was reported to narrow the band gap from 2.7 eV to 1.9 eV, resulting in apparent quantum yields of 8.6% and 4.3% at 420 nm for hydrogen and oxygen evolution during photocatalytic water splitting, respectively, ∼18 times higher than for a reference (untreated) g-C3N4.223 In another study, the same approach of replacing nitrogen linkers/terminals with oxygen significantly reduced the recombination rate in g-C3N4, due to spatial separation of electrons and holes to O-rich and N-rich domains, respectively, resulting in an internal quantum yield of 5.9% at 420 nm for photocatalytic CO2 reduction, nearly three times that achieved with untreated g-C3N4.225
Phosphorous doping has been reported to strongly affect the electronic structure and the electrical conductivity of g-C3N4. The optical band gap was clearly red shifted on incorporating the phosphorous dopant and the electrical conductivity increased by up to four orders of magnitude, resulting in five times higher photocurrent than undoped g-C3N4.224 The formation of surface layer/bulk heterojunctions, such as a g-C3N4/boron-doped g-C3N4 junction, can also help to promote efficient charge transfer and reduce recombination.229 Boron-doping was found to shift the valence band of g-C3N4 upward from +1.35 V to +1.42 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), enabling transfer of holes from the bulk g-C3N4 to the boron-doped g-C3N4 surface layer for use in the water oxidation reaction. A high photocurrent of >100 μA cm−2 was recorded with an IPCE of 10% at 400 nm, which was nearly 10 times greater than pure g-C3N4.229 As discussed in Section 3.5, combining C3N4 with Cd0.5Zn0.5S in a composite heterostructure can also enhance charge separation.156
Although the photocurrent produced by a g-C3N4 film has been shown to decay significantly within 1 hour due to photocorrosion,230 adding a cocatalyst can inhibit the corrosion process and improve the stability of the photoelectrodes.231,232 Further development of g-C3N4-based photoelectrodes is anticipated to contribute to mitigation of the current challenges with PEC water splitting.220,232
5.4 Photoferroelectrics
Ferroelectrics are crystalline materials that possess a spontaneous polarization that can be reversed under an external field. This spontaneous polarization naturally leads to a built-in field40 and it has been proposed that this built-in field can be exploited to efficiently separate photogenerated charges and prolong carrier lifetimes by impeding recombination. This has led to the concept of photoferroelectrics.233,234
Some of the major advantages of the (newer) non-oxide ferroelectrics over more traditional well-established oxide ferroelectrics include a significantly lower band gap (within the ideal range for visible-light activity), easier integration with semiconductor platforms and often a simpler stoichiometry/solid-state chemistry.233 Particular attributes of non-oxide ferroelectric materials that could be interesting for photoelectrodes for PEC applications include a band gap of ∼2.5 eV or lower providing good visible-light absorption, ability to produce photocurrent at zero bias, and efficient conducting paths such as charged domain walls. For example, SbSI, a ferroelectric material with a band gap of ∼2.0 eV, when used in a simple two-terminal device has shown a zero-bias photocurrent of ∼0.1 μA (Fig. 13a). This is due to an anomalous photovoltaic effect when the photon excitation was above the band gap energy,235,236 while the photocurrent was zero when the photon excitation energy was below the band gap energy (Fig. 13b), which is useful for direct conversion of solar irradiation into electricity with bias-free PEC cells.237 Similarly, zero-bias photocurrent generation has been observed in other non-oxide ferroelectrics such as GeS238 and CuInP2S6.239

The observation of high conductivity of domain walls has been demonstrated in the ferroelectric GaV4S8.240 The domain walls exhibit much higher current than the domain region (∼25 nA vs. 10−1 pA, Fig. 13c and d), which is attributed to the screening charge provided by multivalent V4 clusters. The net charge on the Ga3+ site controls the number of 3d electrons in the V4 cluster which determines whether the domain walls are charged by electrons or holes.241–244 The presence of these highly conducting domain walls may enable fast separation and migration of the photogenerated charge carriers for driving the PEC water-splitting reaction.
Although PEC testing of non-oxide ferroelectric materials is still in its infancy, some non-oxide ferroelectric materials with hybrid perovskite structures, such as CsSnI3 and CH3NH3PbI3, have already shown great potential for use in photovoltaic devices.245,246 Thus, in the future we can expect to see efforts that have successfully exploited non-oxide ferroelectric materials as photoelectrodes for PEC water-splitting applications.
6. Summary, outlook and future directions
Despite significant progress on non-oxide materials as photoelectrodes for PEC water splitting over the last few decades, these materials are still not sufficiently developed for commercial implementation. The greatest challenge in our opinion is the demonstration of photoelectrodes that have long-term stability in aqueous electrolyte environments, while increasing efficiency also remains critical.
The most intensely researched non-oxide materials on which photoelectrodes are based, which commonly belong to the classes of II–VI or III–V semiconductors, include GaP, GaAs, InP, CdS, Si, InGaN, CZTS and Ta3N5. These materials have sufficiently low band gaps to allow absorption of a broad portion of the solar spectrum, a necessary requirement for generation of a high photocurrent under sunlight. To further increase the photocurrent generated, the primary strategies are nanostructuring, band gap engineering, surface modification by cocatalysts and heterojunction formation, where the most appropriate strategy to apply depends on the main factor(s) limiting performance of a particular material, e.g., nanostructuring and heterojunction formation can be useful for overcoming limitations related to charge separation and transport, while cocatalysts and morphology control can be used to improve surface reaction kinetics.
Various approaches can be used to overcome the instability issue. The different anions and cations in the electrolyte can influence the stability of the photoelectrode, while heterostructures that promote separation of charges away from components that are susceptible to corrosion and protective layers from thin transparent metallic films to thicker insulating films have been studied as approaches to mitigate poor stability, with some success. However, it is important to consider pinholes and other defects in protective coatings that can limit their effectiveness.
An alternative approach to development of traditional non-oxide semiconductors is exploration of new classes of active materials for photoelectrodes. Some examples of these are metal-free ceramics, polymers and other organic materials, and ferroelectrics; while these materials are still in the early stages of investigation, they demonstrate intriguing characteristics and exotic properties that provide exciting new directions for the field.

 	Fig. 1  Ideal electronic structure (illustrated as both DOS and band structure) of a photoabsorber material for PEC water-splitting applications. Two different scales are shown: electrochemical potential relative to normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) at pH 0, as well as energy on the absolute vacuum scale (AVS). The redox potentials of the water-splitting reaction are indicated by the grey solid lines and the Fermi energy level is shown by the black dashed line.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Standard three-electrode photoelectrochemical measurement setup with a counter electrode (CE), reference electrode (RE), and working electrode (WE) connected to a potentiostat. (b) Band diagram of the interface between an n-type semiconductor (as the photoanode) and electrolyte. Photogenerated electron–hole pairs are separated by the space-charge layer at the semiconductor/liquid junction (SCLJ) as indicated by the arrowheads.	 

 	Fig. 3  Illustration of a cocatalyst applied to the surface of a photoanode. The photogenerated holes move preferentially towards the cocatalyst site, which accelerates the water oxidation reaction to generate O2 gas.	 

 	Fig. 4  The band gaps (grey rectangles) relative to NHE for various non-oxide semiconductor materials in solution at pH = 0.
