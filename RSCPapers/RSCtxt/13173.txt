    , Accepted 11th December 2015First published on 11th December 2015AbstractGdOF:Ln3+ (Ln = Eu, Tb, Eu/Tb, Ce/Tb, Yb/Er, and Yb/Tm) nanocrystals with a hexagonal prism morphology have been readily synthesized by a novel topotactic transformation route. The Gd(OH)2F precursor was first synthesized and structurally analyzed by the Rietveld refinement method. It has been found that the Gd(OH)2F precursor was formed by a novel type of ion-exchange from the brucite-like Gd2(OH)5NO3·0.9H2O (LGdH). Such an ion-exchange behavior is different from the traditional case for the layered double hydroxides (LDHs) in which the intercalated anions are exchanged by the external ions. The detailed structural analysis showed that GdOF prefered [0001] epitaxial growth direction of Gd(OH)2F due to the structural matching of [0001]Gd(OH)2F//[110]GdOF. Furthermore, the potential application of the as-prepared nanocrystals as phosphors is emphasized by demonstrating strong multicolor emissions including both down-conversion and upconversion, and energy transfer (Ce–Tb) processes by GdOF:Ln3+ in detail. Our nonorganic green synthetic strategy based on the novel ion-exchange for the LDHs may enrich the synthetic methodology for nanomaterials.
1. Introduction
In recent years, nanocrystals with a specific size and morphology have attracted intense interest driven by their fascinating size-/shape-dependent properties and potential applications in various areas of modern science and technology.1,2 Increasing stringent demands for functional nanodevices require meticulous control over the size and morphology of the materials at the nanometer scale.3–5 Thus, controlled synthesis of monodisperse nanocrystals with desired size and morphology is a central issue in nanoscience and nanotechnology. Over the last few decades, the synthetic methodology towards nanocrystals has been burgeoning with notable examples i.e., noble metals,6–8 metal oxides,9 and semiconductors.10,11 However, the commonly used wet routes usually need organic surfactants and solvents, tedious processes, and harsh conditions, which are contrary to the green concept in the current nanotechnology.12,13 Besides, these synthetic routes are mainly based on the empirical insight, and lack mechanistic understanding at the inner crystal structure level. Therefore, it is a current trend to develop mechanistically understandable green synthetic strategies for nanomaterials.
Lanthanide (Ln) luminescence has a special status in the forefront of science and technology due to the abundant and unique energy levels of Ln3+, which endow them with fascinating optical properties including narrow emission band, large Stokes or anti-Stokes shift, long-lived luminescence, and high luminescence quantum yield.14,15 Owing to such merits, Ln3+ doped nanocrystals have potential applications in phosphors,16–18 solid-state lasers,19 solar cells,20 and bio-imaging fields.21 It is well established that an ideal host matrix necessitates low-phonon energy and high chemical and thermal stability to ensure excellent luminescence performance of Ln3+ activators. Among them, lanthanide oxyfluorides have been considered to be attractive candidates for host matrixes, because they inherit the intrinsic merits of both fluoride and oxide counterparts featured by low-phonon energy and high thermal stability, respectively.22–24 In addition, the presence of oxygen may widen the excitation range and thus enhance the emission intensity through the O2− → Ln3+ charge transfer (CT).25,26 Thus, Ln3+ doped lanthanide oxyfluorides are ideal host matrixes for both down- and upconversion luminescence, which have been intensively investigated in recent years. The sol–gel Pechini method, hydrothermal with post heat treatment, and thermolysis of rare trifluoroacetate were reported to fabricate lanthanide oxyfluorides nanocrystals. However, they suffered from annoying drawbacks including harsh reaction conditions, wayward experimental variables, and environmental pollution.27–29 Therefore, it is highly meaningful to develop a general and green synthetic strategy for lanthanide oxyfluoride nanocrystals.
In this work, we have presented a green synthetic route for monodisperse GdOF nanocrystals with a hexagonal prism morphology. Such a synthetic strategy consists of two novel topotactic transformation steps. In the first step, the Gd(OH)2F precursor was readily synthesized from Gd2(OH)5NO3·0.9H2O (LGdH) by a novel ion-exchange on the basis of structural similarity between the [Gd2(OH)5(H2O)n]+ unit layer and the Gd(OH)2F {0001} lattice plane. We have also studied the structure of Gd(OH)2F by the Rietveld refinement method. A detailed structural analysis indicated that the single-crystalline to single-crystalline in situ topotactic growth of GdOF from Gd(OH)2F is due to the structural matching of [0001]Gd(OH)2F//[110]GdOF. In addition, we systematically investigated the multicolor luminescence properties including down-conversion, upconversion, and energy transfer (Ce–Tb) processes of the doped samples, GdOF:Ln3+ (Eu, Tb, Eu/Tb, Ce/Tb, Yb/Er, and Yb/Tm).
2. Experimental section
2.1 Chemicals
Ln(NO3)3 (Ln = Ce, Gd, Eu, Tb, Yb, Er, Tm) stock solution was obtained by dissolving the corresponding rare-earth oxides (99.99%) in dilute HNO3 under heating. Commercially available NH4F is of analytical grade and was used without further purification.
2.2 Preparation of Gd(OH)2F precursor
In a typical synthesis, 20 mL aqueous solution containing 1 mmoL Gd(NO3)3 was adjusted until pH = 8.0 using dilute NH3·H2O under magnetic stirring. The LGdH nanosheet appears immediately (the corresponding XRD pattern, SEM image, and TG curve are given in Fig. S1 in the ESI,† and n is calculated by the TG analysis). After stirring for 10 min, the LGdH precipitation was collected by centrifugation. The precipitation was then dispersed into 40 mL aqueous solution containing 1 mmol NH4F and sealed in a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and maintained at 180 °C for 1 h. After hydrothermal treatment, the products were collected and washed with deionized water and absolute ethanol, and finally dried at 60 °C for 12 h.
2.3 Preparation of GdOF nanorods
The GdOF products were obtained by thermal decomposition from the as-prepared Gd(OH)2F precursors at 600 °C in air for 3 h with a heating rate of 1 °C min−1.
2.4 Characterization
The phase structures were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction with a D8 Focus diffractometer (Bruker). Crystal structure refinement employed the Rietveld method as implemented in the general structure analysis system (GSAS) program.30 The morphology and size of the as prepared samples were determined by using a field emission scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) (FE-SEM, S-4800, Hitachi, Japan), and transmission electron microscopy (JEOL-2010, operating at 200 kV). Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were conducted on a thermal analysis instrument (SDT2960, TA Instruments, New Castle, DE) at 5 °C min−1 under an air flow of 100 mL min−1. Down- and upconversion (UC) photoluminescence spectra were recorded with a Hitachi F-4500 spectrophotometer equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp as the excitation source, an external 980 nm diode laser and a R928P photomultiplier tube.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Crystal structure and morphology
In this synthesis, the XRD pattern of the precursor cannot be found in the database, but is close to hexagonal Y(OH)2.02F0.98 (JCPDS no. 80-2004). The EDX spectrum (Fig. 1A) confirms the constituent elements of Gd, O, and F. After heat treatment at 600 °C, the final product is determined to be a rhombohedral GdOF (Fig. 1C) with JCPDS no. 50-0569. Thus, the precursor can be primarily confirmed to be Gd(OH)xF3−x. The corresponding TG curve (Fig. 1B) exhibits a sharp weight loss at about 320 °C with a slight loss before 100 °C. The slight weight loss is caused by removing the absorbed water from the surface, and the following sharp weight loss of 8.6% corresponds to the decomposition of Gd(OH)xF3−x, which is close to the theoretical weight loss value of Gd(OH)2F (8.56%). As a result, the approximate composition formula of the precursor can be calculated to be Gd(OH)2F.

To shed light on the crystal structure of Gd(OH)2F, Rietveld structure refinement was performed using the general structure analysis system (GSAS) program with the initial model of Y(OH)2.02F0.98. Fig. 2 shows the experimental, calculated, and difference XRD profiles for the Rietveld refinement. The refined crystallographic data and refinement statistics for Gd(OH)2F are summarized in Table 1. The refinement confirms the single-phase nature of Gd(OH)2F with the hexagonal space group P63/m(176) and unit cell parameters of a = b = 6.168 Å and c = 3.632 Å. In this structure, the Gd3+ is coordinated by OH− and F− forming a Gd(O/F)9 trigonal prism with each vertical face bearing a pyramid. The Gd(O/F)9 polyhedron linked to the adjacent three ones by sharing edges along the a- and b-axes, and linked to the two adjacent ones by sharing a facet along the c-axis, forming a tunnel-like structure.

Fig. 3 shows the typical SEM image of the as-prepared Gd(OH)2F precursor. It can be seen that the Gd(OH)2F precursors are entirely monodisperse hexagonal prisms with well-defined crystallographic facets. The average size for the prism is about 250 nm in length and 60 nm in diameter. The close-up observation shows that some prisms still maintain hexagonal bundle morphology, indicating a possible oriented assembly growth behavior. The HRTEM images for Gd(OH)2F (Fig. 3C) and GdOF (Fig. 3D) show high-resolution two dimensional lattice fringes, indicating the single crystalline nature. For Gd(OH)2F, the orthogonal (0001) and (100) planes reveal the [0001] anisotropic growth. After heat decomposition, the morphology was retained well with the tropism along the [110] direction for GdOF. Therefore, the structural comparison makes a clear indication that the formation of GdOF is attributed to an in situ Gd(OH)2F-to-GdOF topotactic transformation with the crystallographic relationship of [0001]Gd(OH)2F//[110]GdOF.

3.2 Growth mechanism and topotactic transformation
In our synthesis, LGdH was used as a precursor to fabricate Gd(OH)2F. It is reported that the layered rare-earth hydroxides with a general composition Ln2(OH)5A·nH2O (Ln = Y, Sm–Lu, A = NO3−, Cl−, Br−, etc., n = 0–2) were a series of newly emerged layered materials built up by stacking two-dimensional unit layers with positive charges and anions intercalated in the gallery.31 It was found that the intercalated anions were uncoordinated in the gallery. As a result, they are highly anion-exchangeable and the layered structure is easy to exfoliate into individual layers.32 In the [Gd2(OH)5(H2O)n]+ unit layer, there are three sites for Gd3+. The first 8-coordination type is [Gd(OH)7H2O], forming a distorted GdO8 dodecahedron; the other two 9-coordination types are [Gd(OH)8H2O], forming a GdO9 monocapped square antiprism. The GdO8 polyhedron links to two other GdO8 and four GdO9 polyhedra by edges, constituting a two-dimensional crystalline network of polyhedra. Such an atomic arrangement is similar to that of the {0001} plane of Gd(OH)2F, indicating a possibility of ion-exchange between the [Gd2(OH)5(H2O)n]+ unit layer and the Gd(OH)2F {0001} plane. Moreover, the GdO9 polyhedron can be intuitively viewed as the Gd(O/F)9 polyhedron in the Gd(OH)2F, and the Gd–O bond lengths are close to that of the Gd–(O/F). Additionally, the unique layered structure and the atomically thick unit layer could further facilitate the ion-exchange reaction.
To verify the ion-exchange growth mechanism, we investigated the structural and morphological evolution during the reaction. After 5 min hydrothermal treatment, large amounts of nanorods and nanobundles with the size of 100 nm long and 20 nm in diameter appeared, and the nanosheet structure of the LGdH precursor became loose and collapsed (Fig. 4B). The corresponding XRD pattern (ESI, Fig. S2†) showed the formation of Gd(OH)2F. To clarify the phase of the nanosheet structure, we performed the reaction at ambient temperature to slowdown the reaction rate. After 10 min, a pure loose nanosheet was obtained, and the phase was confirmed to be Gd(OH)xF3−x (ESI, Fig. S3†), which implied an ion-exchange process. The HRTEM image of the bundle structure with the reaction time of 5 min (inset in Fig. 4C) shows the stacking of the Gd(OH)2F (0001) plane along the principal axis, revealing the preferential growth along the [0001] direction. The TEM image of the fractal nanosheet (Fig. 4C) shows the near transparent character, indicating the ultrathin thickness of the nanosheet. The corresponding HRTEM image exhibits two-dimensional lattice fringes along the [0001] zone axis of Gd(OH)2F. The tapping-model atomic force microscopy (AFM) image (ESI, Fig. S2†) reveals that the thickness is close to 1 nm, thus these nanosheets can be confirmed as Gd(OH)2F {0001} individual layers. Therefore, it indicates that the LGdH transforms into Gd(OH)2F {0001} individual layers via the ion-exchange reaction and the concomitant exfoliation process driven by the collapse of the charge balance in the layered structure. The ion-exchange behavior is totally new for layered double hydroxides (LDHs). Then, the newly formed Gd(OH)2F {0001} individual layers oriented and assembled into rod structures along the [0001] direction, and subsequently, the fresh rods further assembled into bundle structures. On the basis of the pieces of empirical evidence, the growth mechanism can be confirmed as a stepwise process including ion-exchange and exfoliation, oriented assembly, and Ostwald ripening, as illustrated in Fig. 5.

 Fig. 5  Schematic illustrations of the growth mechanism and the topotactic transformation for the two-step process. 
Firstly, the introduced F− ions quickly replaced the electroneutral H2O and partial OH− ions in the LGdH unit layer, and partial Gd3+ ions were released into the solution. Meanwhile, the replacement process resulted in charge imbalance in the layered system, which induced exfoliation of the layered structure, leading to the formation of individual Gd(OH)2F {0001} layers. Subsequently, these individual layers tended to assemble into nanorods along the [0001] direction driven by relieving the total free energy by reducing the dominant surface. In rapid succession, these nanorods oriented and assembled into bundle structures by integrating their side face to further relieve the total free energy. Finally, the bundle structures evolved into a well-defined thermodynamically stable hexagonal prism through the Ostwald ripening process. As above-mentioned, the formation of GdOF is attributed to an in situ topotactic transformation from Gd(OH)2F with the crystallographic relationship of [0001]Gd(OH)2F//[110]GdOF. The crystal structure analysis indicates that the inherent close lattice matching between the Gd(OH)2F (0001) and GdOF (110) plane ensures the in situ single-crystalline to single-crystalline topotactic transformation. The detailed structure resemblances are depicted in the Fig. S4,† and the topotactic transformation process is described from a crystallographic perspective in the ESI.† Our growth method can also be used to fabricate other gadolinium oxyfluorides, such as Gd4O3F6 when the NH4F feeding amount was increased to 2 mmol (XRD pattern, Fig. S5†), which indicated the generality of our synthetic route.
3.3 Down- and upconversion luminescence properties

Fig. 6 shows the excitation and emission spectra of the as-prepared GdOF:0.05Eu3+ and GdOF:0.05Tb3+ samples. The excitation spectrum of GdOF:Eu3+ consists of a broad band centered at 252 nm and a weak shoulder centered at 203 nm when the Eu3+ 5D0–7F2 transition is monitored at 612 nm, which can be ascribed to the O2− → Eu3+ charge transfer (CT) transition and the host absorption, respectively. The occurrence of the CT band is meaningful to enhance the emission efficiency compared with the GdF3:Eu3+ counterpart. For GdF3:Eu3+, only the electric dipolar forbidden 4f → 4f intra-configuration transitions of the Eu3+ ions can be found in the UV region, because the higher electronegativity of the pure fluoride system places the CT band into the vacuum UV region.33,34 The weak peaks at 309 and 315 nm can be assigned to the Gd3+ 8S7/2–6P5/2 and 8S7/2–6P7/2 transitions; the lines range from 350 to 425 nm arise from the Eu3+ f–f intra-configuration transitions. For the case of the GdOF:Tb3+ sample, a broad band centered at 243 nm with a weak shoulder centered at 277 nm also dominates the excitation spectrum upon monitoring at 545 nm, which can be assigned to the spin-allowed 7F6–7DJ (ΔS = 0) and spin-forbidden 7F6–9DJ (ΔS = 1) components of the Tb3+ 4f8–4f75d transitions. The weak peaks at 309 and 315 nm can be assigned to the Gd3+ 8S7/2–6P5/2 and 8S7/2–6P7/2 transitions, similar to that of GdOF:Eu3+; the weaker lines range from 320 to 425 nm arise from the Tb3+ f–f intra-configuration transitions.
 Fig. 6  The excitation and emission spectra of GdOF:0.05Eu3+ (A) and GdOF:0.05Tb3+ (B). The inset panels are their corresponding digital photographs under UV excitation. 
Upon excitation into the O2− → Eu3+ CT band, the emission spectrum of the GdOF:Eu3+ sample shows the electronic transitions from the 5D0 level, corresponding to the 5D0–7FJ (J = 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively) and several high-energy transitions, such as 5D1–7F1. The transitions are dominated by the 5D0–7F2 with red emission, indicating a low site symmetry for the Eu3+ ion. It is established that the forced electric dipole-allowed 5D0–7F2 transition is hypersensitive to the site symmetry; distortions or deviations from the centrosymmetric geometry of Eu3+ generally favors the probability of the 5D0–7F2 transition.35 In the GdOF:Eu3+ crystal structure, the Eu3+ ion is coordinated by four O2− and four F− ions, forming a bicapped trigonal antiprism polyhedron with the C3v site symmetry, meaning a noncentrosymmetry for the surrounding of the Eu3+ ions and thus favors the 5D0–7F2 transition.
For the GdOF:Tb3+ sample, the emission spectrum consists of the 5D4–7FJ (J = 6, 5, 4, and 3) transitions dominated by the 5D4–7F5 transition with green emissions under 241 nm UV excitation.
It is well-established that multicolor emission can be obtained by just selecting corresponding activators and concentrations for lanthanide-doped luminescence materials. Here, we have co-doped Eu3+ and Tb3+ ions to demonstrate the potential of multicolor emission for the as-prepared GdOF nanocrystals. Fig. 7 shows a series of emission spectra of the GdOF:Eu3+,Tb3+ cases. It can be seen that all the spectra consist of the simultaneous emissions of Tb3+ and Eu3+. With an increase of the Tb3+ ion ratio, the green proportion increased in the emission, resulting in a gradual composite color of red, orange, and yellow.

We have also featured the energy transfer potential for the as-prepared GdOF nanocrystals. Fig. 8 shows the excitation and emission spectra of the as-prepared GdOF:0.01Ce3+ and GdOF:0.05Ce3+,0.05Tb3+ samples. For GdOF:0.01Ce3+, the excitation spectrum consists of an intense broad band centering at 300 nm and a sharp line at 275 nm when monitored at 390 nm, which can be assigned to the Ce3+ 4f–5d transition and Gd3+ 8S7/2–6I7/2 transition, respectively. Upon excitation into the Ce3+ ions at 300 nm, a broad emission band at around 390 nm can be found, corresponding to the characteristic Ce3+ 4f–5d emission. When co-doped with Tb3+ ions, the sample exhibited strong green emission originating from Tb3+ under excitation of Ce3+ 4f–5d transition at 330 nm, which indicated the efficient energy transfer from Ce3+ to Tb3. Besides the broad Ce3+ 4f–5d band, the relative weak Tb3+ 4f–5d at 230 nm and the typical Gd3+ excitation line at 275 nm can also be detected in the excitation spectrum. When excited into Tb3+ directly, green emission can also be obtained, which was relatively weaker than that when excited into Ce3+ transition, suggesting that the sensitization of Ce3+ ions can greatly enhance the Tb3+ emission in the as-prepared GdOF nanocrystals.

Fig. 9 shows the UC emission spectra of the as-prepared GdOF:0.19Yb3+,0.01Er3+ and GdOF:0.05Yb3+,0.01Tm3+ samples under 980 nm laser excitation. For GdOF:Yb3+,Er3+, the dominated red emission bands (610–710 nm) can be assigned to the Er3+ 4F9/2–4I15/2 transition, and the weak green emissions (500–580 nm) are ascribed to the Er3+ 2H11/2–4I15/2 and 4S3/2–4I15/2 transitions, respectively. For GdOF:Yb3+,Tm3+, the strong red emission bands (620–735 nm) originate from the Tm3+ 3F3–3H6 transitions. The adjacent intense near-infrared (NIR) emission centered at 795 nm corresponds to the Tm3+ 3H4–3H6 transition, and the relatively weak blue emissions (450–500 nm) can be assigned to the Tm3+ 1D2–3F4 and 1G4–3H6 transitions, respectively. Such a high component of red emission in both GdOF:Yb3+,Er3+ and GdOF:Yb3+,Tm3+ samples may endow them with potential application in the bioimaging field. To investigate the UC mechanism, the pump power dependence of the emission intensity of the red (Er3+ 4F9/2–4I15/2 transition) and green (Er3+ 2H11/2–4I15/2 and 4S3/2–4I15/2 transition) emissions of the GdOF:Yb,Er was measured, as depicted in Fig. 9C. The corresponding curves show good linearity in the pump power regime with slopes of 1.67 for the Er3+ 4F9/2–4I15/2 transition and 1.86 for the Er3+ 2H11/2–4I15/2 and 4S3/2–4I15/2 transitions, which suggests a two-photon UC process for the two emissions.36,37 In this process, the 4F9/2 level is populated by a two-step energy transfer from the adjacent Yb3+ ions via4I15/2 → 4I11/2 and 4I13/2 → 4F9/2 transitions with an intermediate nonradiative relaxation of 4I11/2 → 4I13/2 transition. And red emission can be obtained by the 4F9/2–4I15/2 radiative transition. While, the 2H11/2,4S3/2 levels are populated by two successive nonradiative energy transfers from the adjacent Yb3+ ions through 4I15/2 → 4I11/2 → 4F7/2 transitions with subsequent nonradiative relaxation 4F7/2 → 2H11/2,4S3/2 transitions, yielding green emissions via2H11/2,4S3/2–4I15/2 radiative transitions. For the GdOF:Yb3+,Tm3+ case, the 3H4 and 3F3 levels are populated by a two-photon process, while the 1G4 level is populated by a three-photon process, as illustrated in Fig. S6.†

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a novel nonorganic synthetic route to synthesize GdOF:Ln3+ (Ln = Eu, Tb, Eu/Tb, Ce/Tb, Yb/Er, and Yb/Tm) nanocrystals with a hexagonal prism morphology for the first time. The Gd(OH)2F precursor was determined to be the hexagonal phase by the Rietveld refinement method, similar to that of the Y(OH)xF3−x series. The Gd(OH)2F precursor was synthesized from the starting point of the (0001) plane via a novel type of ion-exchange from LGdH due to the structural matching between the [Gd2(OH)5(H2O)n]+ unit layer and the Gd(OH)2F {0001} plane. Such an ion-exchange behavior is totally different from the traditional case for the LDHs in which the intercalated anions are exchanged by the external ions. The GdOF was formed by a single-crystalline to single-crystalline in situ topotactic transformation from Gd(OH)2F with the crystallographic relationship of [0001]Gd(OH)2F//[110]GdOF. In addition, the investigations on the luminescence properties showed that the as-prepared GdOF nanocrystals were an ideal host matrix for both down-, and upconversion emissions, and the typical Ce–Tb energy transfer process, which have potential applications in luminescence devices and biological imaging. Our green synthetic strategy based on the novel ion-exchange for the layered double hydroxide may open a new path in the synthetic methodology for nanomaterials.
