    , Accepted 2nd December 2014First published on 5th December 2014AbstractNew [60] and [70]fullerene homo- and heterodimers absorbing in the visible region have been synthesized and fully characterized. In order to increase the solubility and processability of the new fullerene dimers, different alkyl chains have been used which has allowed the determination of the influence of the solubilizing alkyl groups on the photovoltaic performance. Atomic force microscopy experiments carried out on blends of these dimers and P3HT evidenced the formation of large aggregates, which significantly influence the photovoltaic efficiency.
Introduction
The design and development of new organic materials suitable for preparing new and efficient organic photovoltaic devices is currently a very active area of research.1 The understanding of the elementary processes within Organic Photovoltaics (OPV) has been improved thanks to basic research studies dealing with fundamental aspects such as light harvesting improvement,2 suitable Donor–Acceptor (D–A) band gap alignment3 and nanomorphology control.4 Concerning the D–A scheme, a huge variety of low band gap polymers, or small molecules, have been employed as electron donors.5 On the other hand, considering the electron acceptor component, PCBM has been by far the most employed derivative, and only recently have other fullerene derivatives6 been tested for OPV.7 In order to improve our knowledge of the influence of the acceptor moiety on the photovoltaic performance, in recent years we have been engaged in the preparation of a variety of new fullerene-based electron acceptors.8
Recently, some of us have described the preparation of a new family of soluble [60]- and [70]-fullerene homo- and heterodimers linked through 2-pyrazolino-pirrolidino bridges (Fig. 1, 1–3).9 Bulk heterojunction PV devices of 1–3 with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), showed power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of about 1%. Despite this initially low PCE data, we have decided to continue our exploration of these molecules in order to clarify whether these kinds of fullerene dimers are eventually suitable candidates for preparing efficient solar cells.
 Fig. 1  [60] and [70]fullerene homodimers (1, 3) and the [60]/[70]heterodimer (2), linked through 2-pyrazolino-pyrrolidino bridges. 
To this end, here we present the synthesis, optical and electrochemical properties of a new series of [60] and [70]fullerene homodimers (4a–c, 5a–c) and the [60]/[70]heterodimer (6),10 linked through pyrrolidino-p-phenyl-pyrrolidino (PPhP) bridges (Fig. 2).

In these new compounds we have introduced some structural variations, namely the presence of different alkyl chains and different fullerene units (C60 and/or C70), with the final goal of studying their potential influence on the PV properties. Furthermore, the covalent connectivity of the two fullerene units through pyrrolidine rings in 4–6 significantly modifies the reduction potentials, when compared with the previously reported dimers (1–3) endowed with a 2-pyrazoline ring, thus improving the open circuit voltage parameter. Consequently, the new fullerene homo- and heterodimers exhibit a variety of significant features, which make them appealing systems (4a–c, 5a–c, 6) to prepare organic solar cells.
Experimental section
General procedure for the synthesis of fullerene dimers
To a solution of of 0.69 mmol of C60 (for 4a–c) or C70 (for 5a–c) in chlorobenzene, was added terephthalaldehyde (0.11 mmol) and the corresponding alpha-aminoacid (0.58 mmol). The solution was refluxed for 6 h. Then the solvent was evaporated, and the solid was purified using column chromatography on SEC (Bio-Rad Bio-Beads S-XI) using CS2 as the eluent. The product obtained was twice centrifuged in pentane and methanol to afford a brown solid as the pure dimer in each case (dimers are obtained as a mixture of isomers due to the multiple reactive bonds).
This procedure was used to synthesize compounds 4a, 4b, 4c, 5a, 5b and 5c. The alpha-aminoacid used in each case is: N-octylglycine for 4a and 5a, N-butylglycine for 4b and 5b and N-(2-ethylhexylglycine) for 4c and 5c.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The preparation of [60]fullerene homodimers (4a–c) has been carried out in a single step, by refluxing a solution of pristine C60, terephthalaldehyde and the corresponding alpha aminoacid in chlorobenzene, following Prato's methodology.11 [70]Fullerene homodimers (5a–c) were prepared using pristine C70, following the same protocol. [60]/[70]Heterodimer (6) was prepared via reaction of [60]fullerene aldehyde (7)12 with C70 in the presence of N-octylglycine. The purification of these dimers was carried out using column chromatography on SEC (Bio-Rad Bio-Beads S-XI) using CS2 as the eluent. Then, the obtained product was centrifuged twice in pentane and methanol to afford a brown solid as the pure dimer in each case.
All the dimers were obtained in good yields (37–59%) and their structure and purity were confirmed by spectroscopic and analytical techniques, namely NMR, HPLC and HR-MS. For instance, in the 1H-NMR experiment of compound 4a (Fig. 3, left) all the diagnostic signals, including the pyrrolidine α protons, are observed. Moreover, high resolution mass spectrometry experiments confirmed the formation and high degree of purity of 4a (Fig. 3, right: [M + H]+ = 1826.3835 (calcd C146H44N2: 1825.3583)). As expected, these dimers were obtained as mixtures of stereoisomers due to the presence of two stereogenic centers, which were observed using HPLC.13

Optical properties
The optical absorption spectra of compounds 4a–c, 5a–c, 6 were recorded in toluene solution at 25 °C (Fig. 4). Compound 4a displays a typical [60]fullerene monoadduct derivative absorption pattern, showing weak absorption in the visible region at 311, 329 and 433 nm. For the [70]fullerene homodimer 5a, representative absorption features of [70]fullerenes are seen at 400, 462 and 540 nm. In the case of heterodimer 6, characteristic bands for both, [60]fullerene precursor 7 (313, 333, 434 nm) and [70]-fullerene (396, 467, 537 nm), are observed being a superimposition of two components.
 Fig. 4  Absorption spectra of 4a (green), 5a (blue), and 6 (red) recorded in toluene at 25 °C. 
As can be seen in Fig. 4, there is a clear improvement in the light harvesting properties when the number of [70]fullerene units increases, due to the lesser degree of symmetry of this derivative.6a Moreover, these compounds display high extinction coefficients values due to the presence of the various fullerene units. Therefore in the case of [70]fullerene homodimer 5a we observe a broad absorption spectrum, covering the region from 300 to 700 nm.
The aforementioned results reveal, as expected, the better absorption in the visible range of those molecules bearing more than one C60 unit, and more significantly, when one or two [70]fullerene units are present in the dumbbell.
Electrochemistry
The electrochemical properties of compounds 4a–c, 5a–c, 6 have been studied at room temperature by means of cyclic voltammetry (CV). Compounds 4a–c display the typical redox behaviour of a [60]fullerene derivative, with quasireversible reduction waves at −0.87, −1.28, −1.81 and −2.26 V (4a, Fig. 5). [70]Fullerene homodimer 5a–c showed a similar behaviour, with quasireversible reduction processes at −0.86, −1.27, −1.68 and −2.10 V (5a, Fig. 5). In the cyclic voltammogram of heterodimer 6 the characteristic reduction waves for both, [60]fullerene and [70]fullerene are observed, being a superimposition of two components (Fig. 5) (Table 1).

Compounds 4a–c, 5a–c and 6 show reduction potentials shifted to more negative values compared to those of parent [60]fullerene and [70]fullerene, as a consequence of the saturation of a double bond on the fullerene sphere, which raises the LUMO energy level.14 Raising the LUMO energy level of the fullerene material will produce a larger difference between the HOMO of P3HT and LUMO of fullerene derivative and, therefore, is expected to obtain better values of Voc.
It is important to note, however, that the length and nature of the alkyl chains do not influence the first and second reduction potential values. However, some differences were observed in the third and fourth reduction potentials. These results are in agreement with that expected for the redox properties in these dumbbells since the most significant differences should influence on the blending and morphology with the donor counterpart.
Solar cell performance
Bulk heterojunction solar cells were fabricated in a FTO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT: [60] or [70]fullerene homodimers or the [60]/[70]heterodimer/Al device configuration. PEDOT:PSS was spin coated at 1500 rpm onto an FTO coated glass substrate. Blends of a P3HT: fullerene based material (1:2 ratio) in chlorobenzene was spin coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer. Finally, the last process consisted of the thermal evaporation of the metal contact in the glove box.15 Thus a layer of 70 nm Al metal contact was thermally evaporated through a shadow mask. Fig. 6 shows a schematic illustration of organic bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices showing all its components.
 Fig. 6  Schematic illustration of bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic devices prepared with [60] and [70]fullerene homodimers (4a–c, 5a–c), [60]/[70]heterodimer (6) and P3HT. 
The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured for the above described devices under AM1.5G solar illumination conditions. The J–V measurements, and hence the PCE determination was performed using a solar simulator. Fig. S13 and S14 (ESI†) and Table 2 show the J–V features as well as the performances of bulk heterojuction organic solar cell devices. [60] and [70]fullerene homodimers (4a, b and 5a–b) endowed with octyl and butyl linear hydrocarbon chains showed low values of short circuit current (JSC), and fill factor (FF) leading to poor power conversion efficiencies. [60] and [70]fullerene homodimers endowed with a branched 2-ethylhexyl chain (4c and 5c), showed the best performances. Thus the device prepared with 4c displayed a short circuit current (Jsc) of 3.95 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage of 600 mV, a fill factor of 0.30 and an overall power conversion efficiency of 0.72. From the data collected in Fig. S13 and S14 (ESI†), we can conclude that only compound 4c (PCE = 0.72) displays a photovoltaic performance comparable to those obtained with our previously described [60]- and [70]-fullerene homo- and heterodimers linked through 2-pyrazolino-pirrolidino bridges,8d thus showing a lower photovoltaic performance of the blends of the new dimers (4–6) with P3HT. In an attempt to improve the PCE of these devices, we have prepared blends of 5c and P3HT processed in cholorobenzene and moreover we have performed a process of thermal annealing on the blend. The photovoltaic study of this blend reveals a slightly better PCE of 0.33%. (Fig. S20, ESI†)

In order to gain a better understanding of its nanomorphology composition, atomic force microscopy images of blends of P3HT:[60] or [70]fullerene homodimers or the [60]/[70]heterodimer were obtained.13 To this end, blend mixtures of P3HT:dimer were spin coated on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer. The surface morphology and roughness of each P3HT:dimer blend were analyzed. The studied active layers showed root-mean-square (rms) roughness values between 4.91 nm and 39 nm, which would explain the above mentioned low performance of the prepared solar cells. Consequently, devices prepared with fullerenes endowed with 2-ethylhexyl branched chains (4c and 5c) displayed a smoother morphology exhibiting rms = 7.5 nm for 4c and 4.91 nm for 5c. The devices prepared with 4a, 4b, 5a and 5b, display a significantly less homogeneous distribution, thus showing the presence of larger donor and acceptor domains, which contribute inefficiently to promote charge transport and PV performance (Fig. 7).

Conclusions
A new series of homo- and heterodimers (4–6) involving [60] and [70] fullerenes covalently connected through a pyrrolidino-p-phenyl-pyrrolidino bridge and bearing different solubilizing alkyl chains has been synthesized and fully characterized. The CV data of the new dimers reveal a priori better performances than previous dimers (1–3) and therefore, they have been used in the preparation of PV devices with P3HT as the donor polymer. In contrast to the expectations, the performance of the PV cells was relatively low, which has been accounted for the roughness morphology found in their surface in the AFM measurements. Furthermore, the longer separation induced by the presence of the phenyl moieties in between the two fullerene units should negatively influence the interaction between the acceptors, thus favouring the charge recombination processes.
The experimental findings reported in this work reveal the importance of the design in the fullerene derivatives synthesized in the search for efficient PV devices. In our case we have proved that the distance between fullerene units in dumbbell type dimers as well as the different natures of the alkyl chains have a strong impact on the morphology and, therefore, on the device performance.

FTO glasses are cut into square plates (2.5 × 2.5 cm). Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) is patterned by etching with an acid mixture of HCl and Zinc dust. All FTO glasses are cleaned with acetone and isopropyl alcohol for 20 minutes in ultrasonic bath then, Helmanex soap and finally cleaned distilled water several times, afterwards all glasses are dried by N2 purging.
