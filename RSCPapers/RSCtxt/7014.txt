1. Introduction
Recently, renewable energy technology has been intensively studied to address the problems arising from the exploitation of fossil fuels and their serious environmental impacts. The emission of large amounts of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels enhances radiative forcing and contributes significantly to global warming, leading to major adverse effects on the environment.1–4 To mitigate the negative effects of a fossil-based economy, sources of renewable energy are required to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels and emission of greenhouse gases.5,6 The primary strategy for the utilization of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, is to generate electrical energy. However, the practical application of these renewable energy technologies is hindered by the intermittent characteristic. In this regard, it's crucial to develop energy storage systems capable of storing the harvested electrical energy.7 Among modern energy storage technologies, secondary batteries have become one of the most prominent and fast-growing systems due to the efficient storage and delivery of electrical energy. In recent times, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been widely used in portable electronics and electric vehicles, owing to the high energy-conversion efficiency, long working life and environmental benignity.8–12 In addition, as an alternative battery technology, sodium-ion batteries have attracted great attention due to the abundance and low cost of sodium resources and hold great potential for applications in large-scale grid energy storage.13–16
Considering the increasing demand for higher energy and power density devices with longer working lifetimes, significant efforts have been devoted to the research of LIBs and NIBs to improve electrochemical performance. The electrochemical performance of LIBs and NIBs, including energy density, operation current densities, and working life time, is mainly determined by the electrode materials.17,18 State-of-the-art LIBs often employ the use of metal oxides or phosphate materials (e.g. LiCoO2, LiNiCoAlO2 and LiFePO4) and graphite-based materials as the cathodes and anodes, respectively. Similarly, the current research of NIBs focuses on the development of advanced electrode materials, such as carbon-based anodes and phosphate-based cathodes to promote the industrialization of the NIBs.19–21 In the case of electrode materials, electronic and ionic conductivities are two crucial factors presenting enormous influence on the electrochemical performance, which are usually modified through doping,22–25 control of material size,26–29 and introduction of conductive substrates or additives (e.g. conductive metal, polymers and carbon-based materials).30–35 Among these conductive additives, many carbon-based materials have been widely applied, including graphene (rGO),36–39 carbon nanotubes (CNTs),40–43 and carbon nanofibers (CNFs),44–47 due to their good electronic conductivity and compatibility with other electrode materials. In the meantime, carbon-based materials can be also directly utilized as anode materials for LIBs and NIBs.23,48–50
With a novel one-dimensional (1D) carbon structure, CNFs present good access to electrolytes and high electronic conductivity along longitudinal directions. In this regard, various studies have reported the application of carbon nanofibers in LIBs and NIBs and showed highly improved lithium- & sodium-storage performance, indicating the high research significance of carbon nanofibers for LIBs and NIBs.23,44,50,51 In this review, we focus on the application of CNFs in LIBs and NIBs by summarizing the preparation strategies, structures and composition of CNF-based electrodes in relation to the electrochemical performance.
2. Carbon nanofibers and preparation strategies
Carbon nanofibers are one-dimensional sp2-hybridized carbon nanostructures consisting of discontinuous filaments with aspect ratios (length/diameter) greater than 100. CNFs differ from carbon nanotubes which have structures like wrapping graphene layers to form perfect cylinders.52,53 Various strategies have been applied to prepare CNFs, including the catalytic chemical vapor deposition growth, electrospinning, template-based synthesis and biomass methods.16,54–59
2.1 Chemical vapor deposition growth
The chemical vapor deposition growth of CNFs is usually conducted with metal catalysts, and gaseous hydrocarbon precursors under high temperature.60 During the process, gaseous hydrocarbons act as the carbon source (e.g. methane, acetylene, hexane and ethylene) and decompose in the temperature range of 700 to 1200 K. Metal nanoparticle catalysts composed of iron, nickel, cobalt and various alloys, are capable of dissolving carbon and/or forming metal carbides at the surface, the formed carbon atoms at the surface of catalytic metals would dissolve in the metal and diffuse through the metals. After continuous decomposition of gaseous hydrocarbon and diffusion through the bulk metals, carbon atoms precipitate at the other side of metals and form graphitic structures, completing the preparation of vapor grown CNFs (VGCNFs). During the growth process, the morphology of the metal nanoparticle catalysts is one crucial factor in determining the structures of VGCNFs. Two types of VGCNFs have been fabricated via different metal nanoparticles, namely cup-stacked CNFs and the platelet-stacked CNFs.61–64 As shown in Fig. 1A and B, Pt nanocrystals and Fe nanoflakes are applied as catalysts to prepare stacked CNFs and platelet-stacked CNFs, respectively.

2.2 Electrospun carbon nanofibers
In addition to VGCNFs, numerous kinds of electrospun 1D polymer nanofibers have been utilized as precursors to form carbon nanofibers through carbonization, which have been widely applied in LIBs and NIBs. The electrospinning process is a fast and efficient strategy to fabricate 1D polymer nanofibers and has obtained intensive research attention in the design and fabrication of nanostructured electrodes.16,65,66Fig. 1C shows the typical process of the electrospinning technology. Through the use of a syringe pump, the polymer solution in the syringe forms a droplet at the tip of the metal needle owing to the surface tension. When a high voltage is applied between the metal needle and the collector, the droplet becomes elongated and forms a conical Taylor cone as a result of the electrostatic repulsive force at the surface.67 When the voltage reaches a critical value, the electrostatic repulsive force overcomes the surface tension, leading to a liquid jet ejecting from the droplet and a continuous elongation of the stream due to the existing surface charge of the jet. The elongation process leads to the dramatic decrease of the diameter of the jet to hundreds or tens of nanometers.16,68 Electrospinning is one facile technology utilized to fabricate polymer nanofibers, with numerous polymer precursors commonly employed to form nanofibers, including poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), polyacrylonitrile (PAN), poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP), and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO).16 Through carbonization of the polymer nanofibers in an inert atmosphere, CNFs can be prepared with the structures modified by tuning the precursor solutions and electrospinning parameters.54,66 Additionally, composite nanofibers consisting of carbon and other LIB/NIB-electrochemically active materials have been fabricated via electrospinning through the introduction of active materials' precursors into the electrospinning precursor solutions or combining the active materials into the electrospun carbon nanofibers via other growth strategies, such as C–Sn nanofibers, C–Ge nanofibers, C–MoS2 nanofibers and C–Na3V2(PO4)3 nanofibers.45,47,69,70
2.3 Template-based strategies
In addition to the electrospinning technology, template-based strategies have been widely studied to fabricate polymer nanofibers. CNFs developed by a template-based synthesis often follow two synthetic routes: one popular route is CNFs based on hard-templates, while another is the solution-based synthesis of 1D polymer nanofibers via a template assembly route followed by carbonization.71,72 In the case of the first route, anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) templates have been extensively applied to fabricate CNF arrays or hollow CNF arrays via chemical vapor deposition.72,73 Previous studies have realized the preparation of hollow carbon nanofibers to encapsulate the pre-synthesized active material, such as Si–SiO2 nanofibers.74 On the other hand, the solution-based template assembly route is another method to prepare polymer nanofibers as precursors to CNFs. In 2010, Liu and co-workers71 reported a general oxidative template assembly route to synthesize conducting polymer (i.e. polyaniline (PANI), polypyrrole (PPy), and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)) nanoclips, resulting from the orchestration of an insoluble complex. The insoluble complex is formed between an anionic oxidant (S2O82−) and a cationic surfactant. Based on this oxidative template assembly route, several studies have fabricated conducting polymer nanofibers, mainly PPy, which were then carbonized under an inert atmosphere to develop CNFs and for LIB & NIB applications.48,75 Similar to the oxidative template assembly route, the self-assembly strategy is another way to get polymer nanofibers. Cao et al.49 realized the preparation of hollow CNF anode materials for NIBs through carbonization of hollow PANI nanofibers, which were prepared via a self-assembly synthesis.
2.4 Biomass methods
In addition to the chemical synthesis strategies, biomass can be utilized in the fabrication process of CNFs. The main route of development of CNFs based on biomass methods is the carbonization of organic polymer nanofibers, such as bacterial cellulose, which have been directly utilized as anode materials or act as substrates to support other non-carbon anode or cathode materials for LIBs & NIBs.76–78 Bacterial cellulose is an organic compound (i.e. (C6H10O5)n) with a nanofiber network produced by the bacteria.79 After carbonization, the bacterial cellulose forms a CNF network, with improved electronic conductivity and pore access for electrolytes, indicating superior performance for application in LIBs & NIBs.
As displayed in Table 1, the carbon nanofibers prepared via the four strategies present a similar diameter range from 50 to 100 nm.54,80–86 In addition, the chemical vapor deposition growth and template-based strategies can extend the diameter to 200 nm and carbon nanofibers with a diameter of more than 200 nm can be fabricated via electrospinning. Considering the limitation of preparation parameters (e.g. the growth time of VGCNFs, the scale of templates and precursors of the template-based and biomass strategies, respectively), the length of CNFs fabricated via the three strategies is limited to several to tens of micrometers. As the electrospinning is one continuous spinning strategies, the length of polymer nanofibers can be several centimeters, determining the same length of electrospun carbon nanofibers. In the case of electrical conductivity, related to the crystallization states of CNFs, the VGCNFs show the highest value, around 1 × 103 to 1 × 104 S cm−1. For the other three strategies, the electrical conductivity of prepared CNFs is determined by the preparation parameters, including treatment temperature, heteroatom-doping content and precursors. In general, CNFs prepared through the four strategies can improve the overall electrical conductivity and finally the electrochemical performance of electrode materials when applied in batteries. In addition to the physical properties of CNFs, the cost of CNFs should be also considered in preparation of electrode materials for practical applications. The chemical vapor deposition growth strategy displays the highest cost, due to the low growth rate and high price of catalysts and precursor gas. In contrast, the commercial large-scale production low price of biomass precursors leads to the lower cost of the biomass strategy. And the cost of electrospinning and template-based strategies depends on the polymers and templates used in the strategies. It is ideal to balance the morphology & electrical conductivity and cost of CNFs to realize practical applications of CNF-based electrode materials.

3. Carbon nanofibers applied in lithium-ion batteries
Currently, lithium-ion batteries are widely utilized in portable electronics and electric vehicle applications. Electrodes consist of micrometer-size powder-like lithium metal oxides/phosphate materials and graphite-based materials as the cathodes and anodes, respectively, due to the high-energy density and long working life. However, the micrometer-sized powder-like electrode materials result in a long lithium-ion diffusion distance and limited electronic transport rates, leading to insufficient cycling and rate performance.87,88 To address these limitations, a promising approach is the preparation of advanced electrode materials via structural design and composition optimization. In this regard, design and fabrication of 1D CNF-based electrode materials is a reasonable solution to decrease the lithium-ion diffusion distance due to increased electrolyte contact and a higher surface area–volume ratio.16,89,90 In this section, CNF-based anode and cathode materials will be discussed, focusing on the structure design and its influence on the electrochemical performance.
3.1 Carbon nanofiber-based anode materials for lithium-ion batteries
In modern LIB technology, graphite-based materials are the commercial anode materials of choice due to the advantages of low voltage potential, cycling stability, and cost-effectiveness. However, the low capacity (theoretical capacity: 372 mA h g−1) and sluggish lithium-ion diffusion kinetics has limited the application of graphite-based materials in next-generation high-energy LIBs.91,92 To fabricate high-capacity anode materials, two main strategies have been intensively studied. One is to develop more lithium-storage sites in carbonaceous materials, like porous structures, while another is to develop other non-carbon anode materials with higher theoretical capacity, such as alloy-type anodes, metal oxides and metal sulfides.93–98 For 1D carbonaceous anode materials, CNFs have proven to be a hopeful alternative to traditionally used graphite-based anode materials, owing to the improved access to the electrolytes, fast electron transport pathways along the 3D conductive network and increased lithium storage sites.48,84,99 In the case of alloy-type, metal oxide and metal sulfide anode materials, the fabrication of CNF-based composite anodes would enhance the lithium-ion & electron transport and solve many of the problems of these materials during cycling (e.g. huge volume variation during cycling, unstable solid electrolyte layer (SEI), and aggregation of the active electrode materials), simultaneously.69,70,100 In this subsection, the CNF-based anode materials are summarized and discussed.

3.1.1 Carbon nanofiber anode materials. 
To the best of our knowledge, CNFs were first used as anode materials for the LIBs in the mid-2000s. Zou et al.,101 and Kim et al.84 reported the lithium storage performance of CNFs, which were fabricated via co-catalyst deoxidization and electrospinning strategies, respectively. Although the two studies show the potential applications of CNFs in the LIBs, the electrochemical performance is limited with only 220 mA h g−1 after 30 cycles at 0.1 mA cm−2 and 450 mA h g−1 after 2 cycles at 30 mA g−1, respectively. Afterwards, many efforts have been made to improve the electrochemical performance of CNF anode materials, including heteroatom doping and fabrication of porous structures.
For the heteroatom doping of carbonaceous materials, nitrogen-doping has proven to be a popular strategy to enhance the electrical conductivity and increase lithium storage capacity via the heteroatomic defects,22 which are usually realized by the treatment of carbonaceous material with nitrogen-containing precursors (e.g. NH3, melamine and urea).102–104 Nan and co-workers102 fabricated nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanofibers (NPCNFs) via combining electrospinning and NH3 treatment. During the electrospinning process, melamine was added into the PAN-based precursor solution, acting as the resource of nitrogen. After the carbonization of electrospun nanofibers, nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (NCNFs) would be obtained, which were further treated under an atmosphere of N2/NH3 to yield the NPCNFs. As shown in Fig. 2A, the NPCNFs form a 3D interconnected network with a porous structure due to the activation of NH3. In addition, after the treatment of NH3, the NPCNFs display high nitrogen-doping as shown in Fig. 2B, significantly greater than that of NCNFs and CNFs prepared without melamine and NH3 treatment. Owing to the high nitrogen content and the porous structure, the NPCNFs present an improved cycling performance of 1150 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at a current density of 50 mA g−1 and rate-capabilities superior to that of CNFs and NCNFs (Fig. 2C and D), indicating that the nitrogen doping in CNFs increases the lithium storage capacity and enhance electronic conductivity. Although the post-treatment of CNFs with nitrogen-containing precursors could enhance the electrochemical performance, the post-treatment strategy would increase the complexity and cost of the preparation process. Wang and co-workers105 realized the fabrication of N-doped CNFs via direct carbonization of N-rich conducting polymer PPy nanofibers, which were prepared via the oxidative template assembly route. As the PPy nanofibers contain a high nitrogen content (around 16 wt%), N-doped CNFs were obtained after the carbonization process, retaining a high nitrogen content between 13 and 15 wt%. Furthermore, carbonization at different periods of time led to CNFs with unique nitrogen-doped structures. The nitrogen in the N-doped CNFs can be assigned to three types, N-6 (pyridinic N), N-5 (pyrrolic- or pyridonic-N) and N-Q (graphitic N), whose content in the N-doped CNFs with different treatment times is different from each other. By comparing the electrochemical performance of N-doped CNFs with that of different nitrogen-doping types, the N-6 pyridinic functionality is believed to be the most beneficial in increasing the capacity of CNF anode materials.

In addition to the heteroatom doping strategy, the preparation of porous structures is another rational strategy used to enhance the electrochemical performance of CNFs. The preparation of these structures is usually achieved through the catalytic chemical vapor deposition growth, template-based and activation strategies. Since the cup-stacked CNFs can be fabricated via the catalytic chemical vapor deposition growth, porous CNFs based on the cup-stack design have been fabricated by Deng et al.106 and Subramanian et al.,107 respectively, as anode materials for LIBs with improved lithium storage performance. For the template-based strategy, hard- or soft-templates (e.g. SiO2, poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)) are usually introduced into the preparation process, acting as the artificial sections to produce pores in the CNF materials after removal by etching or decomposition at high temperature.105,108–112 Among the templates, SiO2 is a templating material widely utilized to prepare porous carbon structures.113,114 Ji et al.108 have prepared porous CNFs via the use of a PAN–SiO2 solution as an electrospinning precursor solution, following by the electrospinning and carbonization processes and subsequent removal of SiO2 by etching with HF. Ascribed to the porous structure, the porous CNFs displayed an improved lithium storage capacity (454 mA h g−1 after 10 cycles) over that of the non-porous CNFs (400 mA h g−1 after 10 cycles) when cycled at a current density of 50 mA g−1, suggesting that the fabrication of pore networks in CNFs can increase the lithium storage sites and reversible capacity. Different from the template strategy, the activation process utilizes activation agents (usually, KOH) to react with CNFs and to fabricate the porous structures.48,77,99,115 Qie and co-workers48 have fabricated N-doped porous carbon nanofiber webs (CNFWs) via carbonization of PPy nanofibers with KOH as the activation agents. As shown in Fig. 3A and B, the obtained nanofibers display porous structures with abundant micropores and a 3D interconnected network, whilst presenting a high content of nitrogen doping resulting from the high nitrogen content in PPy nanofibers, similar to Wang et al.'s previously discussed work.112 Comparing the electrochemical performance of the N-doped porous CNFs in Qie et al.'s work and the N-doped CNFs in Wang et al.'s work prepared from the same precursor nanofibers, the highly porous structure further improves the capacity and cyclability at high current densities, 943 mA h g−1 after 600 cycles at a high current density of 2 A g−1 in addition to excellent rate performance at current densities from 0.1 to 20 A g−1 (Fig. 3C and D), implying that the highly porous structure cannot only increase lithium storage sites but also enhance the lithium diffusion rate. Apart from KOH, oxygen can also be used as an activation agent to produce porous carbonaceous materials. As shown in Fig. 4A and B, Li and co-workers99 present highly porous carbon nanofibers (HPCNFs) via carbonization of electrospun PAN nanofibers under a mixed atmosphere of Ar and trace amount of air. The reaction between carbon and oxygen would lead to formation of pores in the CNFs. Benefiting from the increased lithium storage sites and decreased lithium-ion diffusion length, the HPCNFs display significantly increased lithium storage capacity (1780 mA h g−1 after 40 cycles at a current density of 0.05 A g−1) and rate capability, compared with the CNFs without air activation (Fig. 4C and D).

As most of the porous CNFs are made of amorphous carbon, which exhibits lower electronic conductivity than graphitic carbon, the electrochemical activity at higher current densities may be limited. To realize graphitic porous CNFs, Chen et al.116–118 and Zhang et al.119 applied Ni and Fe nanoparticles as a sacrificial catalyst during the carbonization of electrospun polymer nanofibers, respectively. Fig. 5A and B show the structure of the functionalized porous graphitic CNFs (FPG-CNFs) prepared with Fe nanoparticles as the sacrificial catalyst, displaying numerous graphitic nanospheres in the CNFs and plenty of nanopores on the surface of nanospheres after the removal of Fe3N nanoparticles with HNO3. Furthermore, the HNO3 treatment also functionalizes the graphitic porous CNFs with oxygenated groups, which are active for faradaic reactions with lithium-ion. Benefiting from strengthened electronic conductivity of graphitic layers as well as numerous lithium-ion intercalation sites due to the nanopores and oxygenated groups, as shown in Fig. 5C and D, the FPG-CNFs present improved rate performance and cycling performance (609 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at a high current density of 1 A g−1), compared to the CNFs and functionalized CNFs (F-CNFs). In addition, the CNFs also combined with other carbonaceous nanostructures (e.g. carbon nanotubes120 and graphene55) is another promising strategy to increase lithium storage sites and enhance lithium-ion & electron diffusion, simultaneously.

Obviously, the number of lithium-intercalation sites and the lithium-ion & electron transport rate plays crucial roles in the electrochemical performance of CNF anode materials for LIBs. Table 2 summarizes the morphology (i.e. diameter and surface area) and the corresponding electrochemical performance of CNFs. To realize higher specific capacity, it is rational to create more pores or defects CNFs acting as lithium storage sites. However, the resulting high surface area also leads to high irreversible capacity, mainly owed to the formation of a thick SEI layer on the large contact area of electrolytes and electrodes and highly limiting the practical application in commercial lithium-ion batteries. Therefore, it is required to balance between the high reversible capacity and irreversible lithium consumption via designing porous structures. In addition, the electrical conductivity and lithium-ion diffusion kinetics of CNFs are also determined by the pore & defect structures. A highly porous structure provides good access of the electrolyte to the electrode surface and speeds up lithium transport. Nevertheless, a porous structure with pores & defects would damage the crystallinity and electrical conductivity. As a result, the electron and lithium-ion transport in CNFs can be affected by the porous structure, finally acting on the electrochemical performance. Furthermore, the porous structure also has an impact on the mechanical properties and decrease the mechanical strength of CNFs, which is bad for practical application. Therefore, the rational structural design of CNFs should consider the influence of pores & defects on the lithium storage performance (including reversible and irreversible capacity), electronic & ionic conductivity and mechanical properties and optimize the effect on all parts to realize the optimal electrochemical performance and practical application in commercial lithium-ion batteries.

3.1.2 Carbon nanofiber-based composite anode materials for lithium-ion batteries. 
Due to the capacity limitation of graphite-based anode materials, many efforts have been devoted to other types of anode materials, including alloys, metal oxides, and metal sulfides.97 Although these anode materials display higher lithium storage capacity, the cyclability is inferior and inadequate for many practical applications. For alloy-type anodes (e.g. Si, Ge, and Sn), the materials undergo large volume variation, resulting in cracking and pulverization during cycling, which can cause electrode particles to become electrochemically inactive and promotes the continuous growth of the SEI layer which leads to rapid capacity degradation and low coulombic efficiency.95,98 In the case of metal oxides and metal sulfides, like TiO2, SnO2, Fe2O3, and MoS2, the low lithium-ion diffusion rate and poor electrical conductivity limit the electrochemical activity and lithium storage performance, in addition to some of these anode materials undergoing huge volume changes and fast capacity deterioration.121,122 To solve the issues of these anode materials, CNFs may serve as a promising substrate to accommodate the volume change, enhance the ionic & electronic transport and control the nanostructures of these anode materials via designing and fabricating rational structures. These designs include the outer-surface anchoring and encapsulation type structures.
The outer-surface anchoring structure is usually fabricated by growing active anode materials on the surface of the CNFs via magnetron sputtering,100 electrodeposition,123–125 electrophoretic deposition,126 chemical vapor growth,46,127 hydrothermal/solvothermal growth,128–131 and solution-based strategies.132,133 To overcome the huge volume variation and low electronic conductivity of silicon anode materials, Cui and co-workers46 have fabricated carbon–silicon core–shell nanowires via direct chemical vapor deposition of amorphous Si on the surface of the commercial CNFs. As shown in Fig. 6A, amorphous Si is uniformly coated on the surface of CNFs, which has a greater compatibility for the huge volume change compared to crystalline Si, and displays good structural stability during cycling (Fig. 6B). Moreover, the CNFs function as a stable mechanical support for amorphous Si, able to provide fast electronic transport pathways for the entire anode material. Owning to the strengthened structural stability and electronic conductivity, the C–Si core–shell nanowires present good cycle performance as shown in Fig. 6C and D, high reversible capacities of 1300 and 800 mA h g−1 with good cycling stability observed at the current densities of 0.5 and 2.5 A g−1, respectively. The enhanced performance indicates that the outer-surface anchoring structure of active anode materials is feasible to improve the electrochemical performance of alloy anode materials. In addition to the growth of amorphous anode materials on the surface of CNFs, non-carbon anode materials with nanoparticle and nanosheet morphologies have been fabricated on the surface to form the outer-surface anchoring structure, showing improved electrochemical performance. Zhang and co-workers133 have prepared Mn-based transition metal oxide (TMO) nanoparticles anchored to the surface of CNFs to form a nanocable structure (i.e. CNF@MnO and CNF@CoMn2O4) via a solution-based method and subsequent thermal treatment. Fig. 7A and B show the morphology of the CNF@MnO and CNF@CoMn2O4 nanocables, consisting of MnO and CoMn2O4 nanocrystals homogeneously distributed on the surface of the CNFs without any obvious space between the core and shell layers, indicating a tightly anchored structure. The outer-surface anchoring structure of oxide anode materials displays many advantages, including the stabilizing effect of the CNF supporting structures on the metal oxides, which accommodates the large volume changes; a tight anchoring structure to prevent the aggregation of metal oxide nanoparticles during cycling and excellent electronic conductivity of the CNFs to enhance overall electron transport in the nanocable electrodes. Owing to the unique structure, as displayed in Fig. 7C and D, the two materials show good cyclability and high coulombic efficiency (735 and 870 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g−1 for the CNF@MnO and CNF@CoMn2O4, respectively). Additionally, metal sulfide nanosheets have been prepared on the surface of the CNFs to improve the electrochemical performance, such as carbon nanofibers decorated with MoS2 nanosheets (denoted as CNFs@MoS2) fabricated by Zhou and co-workers.129Fig. 8A presents the morphology of the CNFs@MoS2 with mesoporous MoS2 nanosheets grown on the surface of the template-prepared CNFs via the solvothermal method. Furthermore, high-resolution TEM images confirm the expanded interlayer spacing of MoS2 nanosheets from the 0.632 nm of bare MoS2 to 0.684 nm, suggesting higher electrochemical activity. Benefiting from the enhanced electronic and ionic transport of the structure and protective effect of the CNFs on the volume change of MoS2 during cycling, the material displays improved rate performance (Fig. 8B) and a long cycle-life performance of 688 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1 (Fig. 8C).

On the other hand, the encapsulation-type structure is another reasonable design via embedding of active anode materials with nanoparticle, nanosheet, or nanowire morphologies in the CNFs to improve the electrochemical performance. Differing from the outer-surface anchoring structure, which alleviates the stress resulting from the volume change of active materials via downsizing of the active materials to nanoscale particles and the supporting effect of CNFs, the encapsulation structure can further accommodate the large volume variation through the surrounding layers of CNFs to stabilize the structure during cycling. In addition, the three-dimensional (3D) interconnected networks formed by the CNFs display increased electronic conductivity and good access to electrolytes. The main strategy to fabricate encapsulation structure is the electrospinning method,66 whilst the obtained CNF-based composite nanofibers can be modified through other methods, like CVD and other post-treatment (e.g. etching and heat treatment).74,134–136 Since alloy anode materials suffer from huge volume change during cycling and fast capacity decay, Li and co-workers70 have fabricated germanium nanoparticles encapsulated in CNFs (Ge@CNFs) to accommodate the volume variation and improve the cyclability. Fig. 9A show the encapsulation structure of the Ge@CNFs, forming the 3D interconnected network, which has shown excellent structural stability after 100 cycles (Fig. 9B). Ascribed to the encapsulating structure and the enhanced electronic & ionic transport, a high reversible capacity of 1420 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.15C and excellent rate performance have been realized (Fig. 9C and D). This example illustrates the ability of the encapsulation structure to enhance the electrochemical performance of non-carbon anode materials. This type of encapsulation structure has been widely applied to enhance the cyclability and rate capability of other anode materials, including Si,137 SnO2,138 Fe2O3,139 CoO,140 and TiO2.141,142 In addition, to further accommodate the volume change and stabilize the structure during cycling, the inside encapsulation structures with the additional carbon layers or the porous structures have been designed and synthesized to further enhance performance.69,74,135,136,143–146 Fu and co-workers135 have fabricated Si nanoparticles encapsulated in CNFs (Si@CNF) coated with additional carbon layers via the CVD process (Si@CNF–C), which showed good structural stability during cycling (Fig. 10A and B). As shown in Fig. 10C, the Si@CNF–C composite with additional carbon coating layers displays better cycling performance compared to the Si@CNF, suggesting that the additional carbon coating layers is crucial to improving the cyclability. However, the weight content of the active material in the composite is 10 wt%, which needs to be increased to meet the demand of high capacity. To realize an increase in the weight content of Si in the composite, Xue et al.143 have prepared carbon coated Si nanoparticles embedded in the CNFs (Si@C/CNF) with 30 wt% (Fig. 10D). Furthermore, as presented in Fig. 10E and F, the electrodes formed with ground Si@C/CNF show better capacity retention than the Si nanoparticles embedded in the CNFs (Si/CNF) and the Si@C/CNF mat, emphasizing the accommodating effect of the additional carbon layer on the Si nanoparticles and the stabilization effect of the polymer binder. Similar to the elastic characteristics of the additional carbon coating layers, the fabrication of a porous structure is another reasonable way to prevent the anode materials from collapsing.147 In recent times, Yu et al.69,144 have fabricated two rational capsulation structures with porous structures that have been fabricated by Sn nanoparticles embedded in the porous CNFs. By introducing PMMA as sacrificial templates, Sn nanoparticles encapsulated in porous multi-channel carbon microtubes (SPMCTs) were prepared after the decomposition of PMMA (Fig. 11A and B). On the other hand, Sn@carbon nanoparticles encapsulated in bamboo-like hollow carbon nanofibers were fabricated through coaxial electrospinning with the mineral oil as the core template (Fig. 11D and E). The additional empty space in the structures and carbon coating layers on the surface of the Sn nanoparticles can accommodate the volume change of Sn and lead to formation of stable SEI layers and facilitate the ionic transport. Both anode materials presented excellent cycle stability (Fig. 11C and F). In addition to the modification to improve the structure and cycle stability of anode materials, it is vital to increase the electronic conductivity to further enhance the rate performance via introducing highly electronic conductive materials (e.g. heteroatom-doping, carbon nanotubes, graphene, etc.).148–151 Zhang et al.148 reported amorphous SnOx nanoparticles embedded in carbon nanofiber/carbon nanotube composites (SnOx/CNF/CNT) with the typical core–shell structure prepared via the electrospinning, consisting of SnOx@CNF as the core and CNTs embedded in the shell (Fig. 12A–C). Benefiting from the enhanced electronic conductivity of the 3D interconnected conductive network and the CNT shell structure, shown in Fig. 12D and E, the SnOx/CNF/CNT presented good rate and excellent cycling performance at a high current density of 2 A g−1 (a high reversible capacity of 405 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles).

As summarized in Table 3, the fabrication of CNF-based composites is one reasonable structural design to improve the electrochemical performance of non-carbon anode materials for the LIBs, due to its excellent electronic and good access to the electrolytes based on the 3D interconnected CNF networks. In addition, CNFs are capable of acting as a stress buffer to accommodate the volume change of anode materials during cycling and improve cycling stability. Furthermore, the layers of CNFs can also contribute to the formation of a stable SEI layer and reduce continuous consumption of the electrolyte during cycling. However, the high specific surface area of CNF-based anode materials would cause high irreversible capacity due to the decomposition of the electrolyte on the surface and formation of the SEI layer. Therefore, it is crucial to design rational structure of CNF-based anode materials to balance the enhancement of electron & ion transport and structural stability between the surface area. Moreover, the specific capacity of CNFs is usually lower than that of non-carbon anode materials. The weight content of CNFs in the composite anode materials is one key factor to influence the overall capacity of the CNF-based anode materials. Although it is required to prepare composite anode materials with a high enough content of CNFs to stabilize the overall structure during cycling. Consequently, it is reasonable to adjust the content and design morphology of CNF-based anode materials to realize high electrochemical performance, structural stability and low irreversible capacity, simultaneously.

3.2 Carbon nanofiber-based composite cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries
Currently, the research of cathode materials for LIBs is focused on lithium-transition metal oxides (e.g. LiCoO2, LiMn2O4, LiFePO4), transition metal oxides (e.g. V2O5) and transition metal sulfides (FeS and FeS2).152,153 Among these cathode materials, LiFePO4 holds promising potential in the application of next-generation high-energy lithium-ion batteries, due to the excellent cycling stability, abundant resources, and environmental benignity.154 Nevertheless, the sluggish mass and charge transport in LiFePO4 limits the electrochemical activity and electrochemical performance. To overcome the limitations, various strategies have been applied to fabricate nanosized electrode materials and efficient electron conductive pathways to enhance ionic and electronic conductivity, such as the fabrication of CNF–LiFePO4 composites.155–158 To develop a superior cathode material, Zhu and co-workers155 synthesized carbon-coated singly-crystalline LiFePO4 (LFP) nanowires via an electrospinning method. As presented in Fig. 13A and B, the single crystalline LFP nanowires grow along the c axis and display a short mass transport length along the a and b directions, coated by carbon layers to form 3D interconnected electronic conductive networks. The rapid lithium-ion and electron transport of the structure led to excellent rate performance (Fig. 13C) and improved cycling stability at a high current density of 1C in addition to excellent thermal stability at a high temperature of 60 °C (Fig. 13D). In the case of other cathode materials, such as Li2MnSiO4,159 LiFe1−yMnyPO4,160 Li2Mn0.8Fe0.2SiO4 (ref. 161) and LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4,162 the introduction of CNFs to form composite anode materials is also able to improve the electrochemical performance. Additionally, different from the traditional cathode materials, the transition metal sulfide cathode materials (e.g. FeS and FeS2) suffer from issues attributed to long-chain lithium polysulfides formed during cycling, including shuttle effects and side reactions with electrolytes.163,164 Zhu and co-workers165 fabricated an Al2O3-coated FeS2@carbon fiber material via a electrospinning method and an atomic layer deposition (ALD). Fig. 14A and B display the morphology of the FeS2@carbon fiber and the Al2O3-coated FeS2@carbon fiber, respectively, presenting FeS2 encapsulated in the carbon nanofibers. Moreover, owing to the protection of the Al2O3 coating layers, FeS2 nanoparticles remain embedded in the CNFs and show excellent structural stability during cycling as shown in Fig. 14C. In addition, the coated materials resulted in improved cycling performance at a current density of 200 mA g−1 (Fig. 14D, 530 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles with a low capacity rate of 0.12% per cycle). Furthermore, the electrodes show high energy density and reach 840 and 1110 W h kg−1 based on the electrode and active material, respectively, holding great promise for potential application in next-generation high-energy lithium-ion batteries.

As displayed in Table 4, CNFs play a crucial role in the enhancement of the mass and charge transport and protection for the cathode materials as the substrate. Since the cathode materials are facing two main challenges, low ionic and electronic conductivity, the utilization of CNFs cannot only enhance electrical conductivity via the formation of a 3D conductive network but also facilitate electron transport through increasing the contact area between the electrode and electrolyte and downsizing the particles of cathode materials. However, CNFs display negligible capacity in the operation window of the cathode materials, decreasing the overall capacity of the composites. The content of CNFs should be adjusted to balance between the beneficial effect on ion & electron transfer and overall capacity. Additionally, the formed 3D network with macropores provides good access to the electrolyte, while the structure would lower the tap density of cathode materials and energy density, which is one crucial factor for practical application. Therefore, the structure and composition of the CNF-based cathode materials should be optimized to balance all factors and realize high electrochemical performance for next-generation high-energy commercial lithium-ion batteries.

4. Carbon nanofibers applied in sodium-ion batteries
Due to the low-cost and abundance of resources with promising potential in applications of medium and large-scale energy storage, sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) have gained intensive attention as potential alternatives to lithium-ion batteries.13 Nevertheless, the Na+ shows a relatively sluggish intercalation mechanism compared to Li+ because of the larger ion radius (almost 55% larger than that of Li+).15 Therefore, the current research of NIBs mainly focus on the development of advanced electrode materials to gain improved electrochemical performance. Similarly, along with the wide application of CNFs in the electrode materials for the LIBs, CNFs have been intensively studied in the NIBs to enhance electrochemical activity and electrochemical performance. In this section, carbon nanofiber-based anode and cathode materials will be summarized and discussed with a focus on the rational structure designs leading to improved electrochemical performance.
4.1 Carbon nanofiber-based anode materials for sodium-ion batteries
For the current commercial graphite-based anode materials for the LIBs, very low sodium-storage capacity can be delivered, due to the relatively narrow inter-layer distance and weak bonding to sodium.166–168 Hence, a great range of other anode materials have been intensively studied, such as disordered carbonaceous materials, alloys, metal oxides and metal sulfides. Among the anode materials, CNFs have been widely applied directly as the anodes or as conductive substrates to further improve the electrochemical performance of active materials.50,78,169

4.1.1 Carbon nanofiber anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. 
As discussed above, graphite-based materials are not suitable for sodium storage; however, the sodium storage capabilities of the carbonaceous materials can be improved by creating defect sites.170 Among the disordered carbonaceous materials, 1D CNFs fabricated from pyrolysis of polymer nanofibers shows highly improved sodium storage capacity, owing to a large number of defect sites to store sodium in addition to improved electronic & ionic conductivity.23,49,50,78,102,171–179 Luo et al.171 and Chen et al.173 fabricated CNFs via carbonization of cellulose nanofibers and electrospun polymer nanofibers, respectively, presenting improved electrochemical performance due to the increased number of defects in the CNFs. To further increase the sodium-storage capacity, Li and co-workers50 synthesized porous carbon nanofibers (P-CNFs) through an electrospinning method with the triblock copolymer Pluronic F-127 as the template. As displayed in Fig. 15A, P-CNFs show a 3D interconnected structure with plenty of micropores, formed from the decomposition of the F-127 during carbonization, which additionally presents an excellent structure stability during cycling without obvious cracking (Fig. 15B). As a result of structural stability, the P-CNFs display a high reversible capacity of 266 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 50 mA g−1 and enhanced rate capability of 60 mA h g−1 cycled at a high rate of 10 A g−1 (Fig. 15C and D). Additionally, similar to the carbonaceous anode materials for the LIBs, heteroatom-doping (mainly nitrogen-doping) and activation methods are viable strategies to produce defects and increase ion-storage sites in carbonaceous materials. Although several studies used high-nitrogen-content polymers as the precursors to form N-doped carbon nanofibers, such as polypyrrole and polyimide,23,172,174,176 the treatment of carbonaceous materials with nitrogen-containing materials (e.g. nitrogen, and urea) is another efficient strategy to realize nitrogen-doping.177,178 To further promote enhanced sodium-storage performance, nitrogen and oxygen dual-doped porous carbon nanofibers (NOC) were prepared by Wang and co-workers78via carbonization of bacterial cellulose@PANI nanofibers and activation with KOH. As displayed in Fig. 16A and B, the porous carbon nanofibers form a 3D interconnected network, which serves as a fast electron transfer pathway with a concentration of sodium storage sites, and display nitrogen & oxygen dual doping (Fig. 16C and D), which further enhance the electronic conductivity and access to electrolytes. Benefiting from the unique structure, the NOC composite presents a high reversible capacity of 545 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g−1 and improved rate capability (Fig. 16E and F).

As displayed in Table 5, the fabrication of porous structures and heteroatom doping has been demonstrated to be beneficial to the improvement of the sodium storage performance in the CNFs. Similar to CNF anode materials for the LIBs, the number of sodium-ion storage sites in CNFs would determine the electrochemical performance and the porous structure has an important effect on the electron & ion transport, growth of the SEI layer, irreversible capacity and mechanical strength, simultaneously. However, the rational porous structure of CNF anode materials for NIBs should be different from that for LIBs due to the larger ion radius of sodium ion. It is postulated that CNF anodes for NIBs require pores of a larger diameter than those for LIBs. There are few studies focusing on the comparison of rational porous structures for LIBs and NIBs, respectively, including pore size, pore number and hierarchical pores. Further investigations are needed to clarify the challenges.

4.1.2 Carbon nanofibers-based composite anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. 
Similar to LIBs, the research of the anode materials for NIBs has been extended from carbonaceous materials as discussed above to other anode materials, such as alloys, metal-oxides and metal sulfides/selenides with higher theoretical capacity. For the alloy anode materials, the research is primarily focused on Sb and Sn, since the Si and Ge show sluggish kinetics of sodiation and low sodium storage capacity.180 Sb and Sn also undergo huge volume change during the sodiation/desodiation process and suffer from rapid capacity degradation, which is also a significant limitation of some metal oxide anode materials.15 In addition, the sluggish mass and electron transport rate during the sodiation process leads to poor cycle performance. Therefore, the two types of structures based on CNFs applied in LIBs (i.e. outer-surface anchoring and encapsulation structures) have also been investigated to further improve the electrochemical performance of NIBs.
As the CNF-based outer-surface anchoring structure could enhance the electron transport and access to the electrolyte, it is likely that the anode materials anchored to the surface will yield improved sodium storage performance. Hou and co-workers57 prepared Sb nanoparticles anchored on PPy derived CNFs, showing improved cycling performance and capacity retention of 96.7% after 100 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g−1. To further improve the structural stability and cyclability of the outer-surface anchoring structure, Dirican et al.181 fabricated carbon coating layers on the surface of SnO2 electrodeposited porous carbon nanofibers (PCNF@SnO2@C). Fig. 17A and B display the morphology of the PCNF@SnO2@C composite, consisting of SnO2 nanoparticles grown on the surface of the electrospun CNFs coated with amorphous carbon layers. Owning to the protection effect of the carbon coating layers and elastic CNFs, the PCNF@SnO2@C composite presents excellent structure stability during cycling (Fig. 17C) and better cyclability than PCNF@SnO2 without carbon coating, a high reversible capacity of 374 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 50 mA g−1 (Fig. 17D).

Compared with the outer-surface anchoring structures, the encapsulation technique has been applied in more studies to improve the electrochemical performance of the non-carbon anode materials. Zhu et al.169 and Wu et al.44 have fabricated Sb nanoparticles embedded in CNFs via an electrospinning method to stabilize the Sb, which suffers from the huge volume change during cycling. This type of encapsulation structure based on CNFs has been widely utilized in other alloy-type anode materials to enhance structural stability, such as Sn182,183 and SnSb alloys.184,185 Furthermore, the metal oxides, metal sulfides and metal selenides such as SnO2,148 Li4Ti5O12,186 TiO2,187 MnFe2O4,188 MoS2,47,189 NiSe2 (ref. 190) and FeSe2 (ref. 191) have been intensively researched to improve the ionic & electronic conductivity and structure stability via fabricating the encapsulation structures. The size of the anode materials in CNFs has a significant effect on the electrochemical activity. To realize high electrochemical activity, Zhu and co-workers47 prepared single-layered MoS2 nanoplates (0.4 nm in thickness) embedded in the CNFs via the electrospinning method as displayed in Fig. 18A–D. Benefiting from the unique structure, the single-layered MoS2 carbon nanofiber composite presents excellent rate and cycling performance of high reversible capacities of 484 and 253 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 1 and 10 A g−1, respectively (Fig. 18F and G), showcasing the high electrochemical activity of the composite.

As presented in Table 6, the non-carbon anode materials suffering from large volume variation or sluggish mass and charge transport have been intensively studied via introducing CNFs to fabricate the CNF-based composites through the two main structures (i.e. outer-surface anchoring and encapsulation structures) and improve the sodium storage performance. Similar to anode materials for CNF-based anodes for the LIBs, CNFs are able to stabilize the structure, enhance electronic and ionic transport. Nevertheless, the volume change of anode materials for the NIBs is more serious than that of the same anodes for LIBs owing to the larger sodium ion. The accommodation effect of CNFs on the anodes for NIBs should be further clarified, focusing on the study of the influence of weight content and morphology (e.g. thickness, diameter, porous structure). On the other hand, different from the CNF-based anode materials, the sodium-ion diffusion in the CNF substrate should be further considered, due to the larger diameter and low bonding effect of the sodium ion. Furthermore, the high surface area and low sodium storage capacity of CNFs can result in irreversible capacity and reduction of overall capacity. The weight content of CNFs and structural design of the composite anode materials should be adjusted to lower the negative effect. Therefore, further study is required to consider the combined effect of CNFs on the non-carbon anode materials for NIBs.

4.2 Carbon nanofiber-based composite cathode materials for the sodium-ion batteries
In the case of cathodes, numerous materials with similar crystalline structures to those of which are found in LIBs have been exhaustively studied, such as manganese oxides (e.g. Na0.44MnO2 and λ-MnO2),192,193 layered oxides (e.g. P2-NaxCoO2),194 natrium super ion conductor (NASICON)-type materials (e.g. Na3V2(PO4)3),195 and olivines (e.g. FePO4 and Na(Fe0.5Mn0.5)FePO4).196,197 For these cathode materials, CNFs have been demonstrated to be good conductive additives and improve the electronic conductivity and sodium-storage performance.45,198
Among the cathode materials, the NASICION-type materials (e.g. N Na3V2(PO4)3) have been demonstrated to be promising cathodes for NIBs. However, the electrochemical performance of Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) is limited due to the high electrical resistance. Based on the above discussion, it is rational to downsize the particles and fabricate an electronically conductive material–NVP composite to enhance the electrochemical activity. The fabrication of NVP–CNFs composites has proven to be an efficient strategy to overcome the limitations of NVP.45,198,199 Liu and co-workers45 synthesized NVP nanoparticles encapsulated in the CNFs (NVP/C) via the electrospinning method. As presented in Fig. 19A and B, the NVP nanoparticles are embedded in the CNFs, forming the interconnected structure. Due to its unique structure, the NVP–C composite showed a high reversible capacity of 117 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles and a current density of 0.1C and retained improved rate capacities at higher current densities (Fig. 19C and D).

Similar to the cathode materials for the LIBs, the cathodes for the NIBs also require enhancement of electron and ion transport to improve the slow kinetics of sodium-ion storage. The formed 3D conductive network provides good electron transport paths and good access for the electrolyte, finally improving the electrochemical performance of the cathode materials. However, the negligible capacity of the CNFs in the operation window of the cathode materials decrease the overall capacity of composite cathode materials. Therefore, the weight content of the CNFs should be adjusted to balance the enhancement effect of electron & ion transport and overall capacity of the composite cathodes. In addition, the diffusion of sodium ions in the CNFs is different from that of lithium ions, which should be further studied to clarify the effect of the CNFs on the cathodes for the NIBs.
5. Conclusions and perspective
In this review, we have summarized the progress of the application of carbon nanofibers in LIBs and NIBs, including the introduction of the preparation strategies of CNFs and efficient utilization in the development of advanced electrode materials. Furthermore, this review focuses on the evolution in structures and composition of CNF-based electrode materials for LIBs and NIBs and the resulting improvement in electrochemical performance. We have placed an emphasis on the discussion of the influence of structural morphology on the stability during cycling, transport rate of the electrons and ions, electrochemical activity and electrochemical performance. CNFs have been demonstrated to be superior anode materials for LIBs and NIBs in addition to acting as effective substrates for other non-carbon anode & cathode materials. The composite electrodes improve electrochemical performance, due to several advantages including: (a) convenience of fabrication via various strategies, such as porous structures, such as outer surface anchoring structures and encapsulation structures, which enhance active sites and structure stability; (b) 3D interconnected networks to facilitate charge transfer along the fast electronic transport pathways and ensure good access to the electrolytes; (c) a high surface area–volume ratio to decrease the distance of the mass transport, further enhancing ionic transfer kinetics.
Currently, CNFs show great promise in the application of next-generation high-energy LIBs and NIBs through rational structural designs. Nevertheless, there remain several challenges to overcome in the future before practical applications are realized. Firstly, the influence of CNFs on the lithium- & sodium-storage performance with different structures and compositions should be further studied to figure out the most efficient structure designs for different electrode materials. Secondly, the improvement of ionic and electronic conductivity via the introduction of CNFs should be further researched to understand the mechanism and its effects on the electrochemical performance. Finally, large-scale fabrication strategies for the CNF-based electrode materials are urgently required to meet the demand for their practical applications. In industrial scale production, the main concerns are the preparation rate and cost. The electrospinning method has undergone rapid development to realize industrial scale production methods via multi-spinnerets of non-needle systems, while the biomass method is another potential strategy to obtain large amounts of precursors for the CNFs, as the bacterial cellulose is commercially available with an acceptable production rate. Along with the continuously increased production rate and decreased cost, the development of CNF-based nanostructures would hold great promise to realize the next-generation of high-energy lithium-ion & sodium-ion batteries in the not-too-distant future.
