    , Accepted 1st February 2023First published on 8th February 2023AbstractMXenes are a type of two-dimensional graphene-like layered material with a wide variety of species, high earth abundance and low cost. Because of their unique physical, chemical, optical, electronic and mechanical properties, they can realize multi-functional catalysis for hydrogen production by water splitting. However, due to the fact that research on electrocatalysis using MXene-based materials is in its infancy, currently the focus is on basic types of MXene-based materials, such as Ti3C2Tx and Mo2CTx. In this case, the investigation of their specific catalytic mechanism combined with various in situ characterizations and optimization of their catalytic performance under the guidance of DFT theoretical calculations are still inadequate. Furthermore, there are no methods completely suitable for their large-scale industrial production at present, and thus-there is plenty space for the exploration and development of MXene-based materials. Based on these facts, herein, we summarize the main electrocatalytic mechanisms and indices for the evaluation of the HER, OER, and water splitting on MXene-based catalysts in acidic and alkaline media and review the research progress of 2D/3D MXene-based catalysts and their modification and compounding with other materials in the field of water electrolysis in recent years. Finally, combined with theoretical calculations, we predict the challenges that MXene composite materials will face in the future when they are used for efficient hydrogen production from water splitting.
1. Introduction
In contrast to the intermittent availability of water from photolysis, which is restricted by the region and season, the electrolysis of water can continuously store excess electric energy produced in the form of chemical bonds (such as H2).1 The device for water electrolysis was developed as early as 1930s, but to date, this technology has been unable to overcome the technical barriers and limitation of high-cost catalysts, resulting in low economic benefits. Therefore, researchers have devoted their efforts to pursuing alternative noble metal catalysts with high catalytic performance, low cost, high abundance, high stability, long-term durability, multi-function and wide pH (the potential of hydrogen) application range,2 which is also necessary to overcome the competitive disadvantage of water electrolysis.
As emerging 2D nanomaterials in the last ten years, MXenes have become one of the research hotspots worldwide because of their unique characteristics and wide application in many fields.3 MXenes are a class of transition metal carbide/nitride/carbonitride materials. In their X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, their fingerprint is the (002) peak,4 and their M layer is a graphene-like structure with six symmetrical hexagonal lattices5 and unique domain structures.6 Generally, MXenes are prepared by selectively etching layer A with the MAX phase7 as the precursor. M is an early transition metal, such as Mo, Ti, and V. A is mainly a group IIIA or IVA element, such as Al, and X is C or N element.8 The structure of the parent MAX is an alternating arrangement of MX layer and A layer (Fig. 1a). The M layer can be a single element layer or a multi-element layer (such as TiVNbMoC3 and TiVCrMoC39), in which multi-elements can exist in the M layer in the form of ordered distribution or solid solution (random distribution).10 According to their different structures, MXenes can be divided into five types (Fig. 1b).11 Therefore, a wide variety of MXenes can be prepared, depending on the choice of the transition metal elements and diversity of their structures. Simultaneously, after etching the A layer, different functional groups will be substituted on the surface according to the etchant, which is called termination, expressed by Tx, such as –F, –OH, –O and –Cl termination. Therefore, the surface chemical properties of MXenes can be well adjusted and the selectivity and catalytic activity of MXenes can be changed by changing their functional groups.

At present, it is an important direction to realize multi-functional electrocatalytic overall water splitting to produce hydrogen gas and oxygen gas via MXene catalysis. Because of the unique two-dimensional structure of MXenes, they have a large specific surface area (SSA) and the movement of electrons can be limited to an ultra-thin two-dimensional area, causing MXenes to possess good metal conductivity and high conductivity.12,13 Furthermore, the electronegative surface and relatively low work function of MXenes enable the transfer of electrons with composite materials, resulting in electron coupling, changing the electronic structure of the composite materials and producing strong interface interaction, which can effectively reduce the thermodynamic barrier and promote the kinetics of the reaction.14 Simultaneously, the atomic thickness of MXenes and strong covalent bonds between their layers endow them with strong mechanical strength. Different from the hydrophobicity of most carbon-based materials such as graphene, MXenes can be directly employed in water electrolysis because of their hydrophilic surface functional groups, which can fully contact with the electrolyte. Their functional groups can also be used to anchor noble metal materials and have better corrosion resistance than carbon-based carriers. In addition, MXenes can also be directly utilized as cathode and anode materials to achieve multifunctional electrocatalytic overall water splitting, while achieving the production of hydrogen and oxygen, which is unlikely to be achieved by traditional precious metals. Thus, MXenes have potential as high-performance electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.
However, MXenes have a large surface energy, making them unstable. Thus, the system will be stabilized by physical adsorption and generate interlayer self-accumulation through van der Waals force. In this case, the self-stacking phenomenon can be well suppressed by intercalating other substances, constructing porous structures and forming three-dimensional (3D) structures, where the precise control of these structures is the key to the construction of the desired materials.10 Simultaneously, it is necessary to reduce the thickness of 2D MXenes to maximize their specific surface area and expose more active sites. Special preparation methods can be used to reduce the thickness of MXenes directly by ultrasonic delamination or hand delamination, such as mixed etching with fluoride salts and hydrochloric acid.21 The MXene sheets can also be made thinner by appropriately extending the etching time22 or ultrasonic processing at higher frequencies.23 Furthermore, as the most common method, intercalants can be used for delamination to reduce the thickness of MXenes, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)24 and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBA·OH).25 In addition, given that the surface of MXene is thermodynamically metastable,26 most of the MXenes obtained by etching in aqueous medium are easily oxidized under environmental conditions (including water and oxygen), resulting in the destruction of the MXene structure and deactivation of its catalytic performance. Therefore, to realize the large-scale industrial application of MXenes, it is not only necessary to explore suitable preparation methods but also solve the problems of hydrogen storage and overall water splitting stability.10
Considering this, herein we summarize the different reaction mechanisms of overall water splitting and the two half-reactions (hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER)) under acid or alkali conditions and the indices for the evaluation of the catalytic performance of MXene-based materials for electrocatalytic water splitting. Then, we focus on the outstanding research on the optimization of the catalytic performance of MXenes in the electrolysis of water in the last five years, including doping, surface modification and defect control, construction of 3D or porous MXenes and formation of composite materials. Finally, we briefly describe the challenges faced by MXene-based materials in overall water splitting, such as the oxidation of MXenes and the limited research status of nitride MXenes.
2. Reaction mechanisms of hydrogen and oxygen production by water splitting
2.1 HER mechanism of MXene-based catalysts
Hydrogen has the characteristics of high specific energy density (142 MJ kg−1)27 and non-pollution emission.26 It is a type of clean energy that is expected to replace fossil energy and can be used to store intermittent renewable energy, such as wind energy, solar energy, and ocean energy.28 It is also an indispensable chemical raw material, such as powder metallurgy reductant and fuel for internal combustion engines and large-scale synthesis of ammonia, various polymers or methanol.29 Electrocatalytic hydrolysis is a promising method for the production of hydrogen, which can convert electrical energy into hydrogen energy and store electrical energy in the form of molecular fuel. Simultaneously, hydrogen energy can be converted into electrical energy through fuel cells and other devices,30 laying the foundation for the interaction between electrical energy and hydrogen energy in the future. In overall water splitting, the half reaction of hydrogen production is the HER, which occurs at the cathode and was discovered by A. Paets Van Troostwijk et al. in 1789.31 According to the pH value of the electrolyte, it can be divided into acidic and alkaline/neutral HER, where the electrode reaction is different under these two conditions. Under acidic condition, hydrogen is generated by the direct reaction of H+ in the electrolyte, while under alkaline/neutral conditions, hydrogen is obtained by the dissociation of water molecules in the electrolyte.
When MXenes are applied in alkaline/acidic HER, the complete HER process may undergo a Volmer–Heyrovsky step or Volmer–Tafel step.32,33 Under alkaline condition, Eqn (1)34 represents the Volmer reaction, which is the process of water molecules forming adsorbed hydrogen atoms (Had) at the HER active site of the catalyst, which mainly occurs on the transition metal M or surface functional group (–O or –OH) of MXenes.33Eqn (2)34 represents the Heyrovsky reaction and eqn (3)34 represents the Tafel reaction, which is the desorption process of Had and is carried out on the entire MXene electrode surface.33 They represent the combination of adsorbed hydrogen atom (Had) with a water molecule or the combination of two adsorbed hydrogen atoms (Had) on the catalyst surface to release hydrogen, respectively.
Generally, the important factors influencing the HER performance under alkaline conditions include the water adsorption/dissociation abilities on the active sites, hydrogen binding energy and adsorption strength of OH− aqueous solution.34 The alkaline HER catalytic activity of MXene materials can be improved by establishing double active sites to balance the adsorption and desorption of the *OH and *H intermediates; by alloying and internal defect control, doping or compounding to change the electronic structure of the material, thereby adjusting the d-band center of its transition metal; adjusting the surface geometry of the catalyst (alkaline HER is very sensitive to the surface structure of the catalyst), such as lattice strain engineering;35 introducing another metal element in the metal lattice to form a bimetallic system; and through the ligand effect/strain effect (average metal–metal-induced bond length change), which causes the d-band center to move, thus improving the catalytic activity of the material.36 H2O + e− → Had + OH−(1) Had + H2O + e− → H2 + OH−(2) Had + Had → H2(3)where Had (adsorbed hydrogen atoms) represents the hydrogen atom adsorbed on the active site of the catalyst.
Under acidic condition, the electrocatalytic HER on MXene-based catalysts is mainly carried out by proton discharge triggering reaction.4Eqn (4)34 represents the Volmer reaction, eqn (5)34 represents the Heyrovsky reaction, and eqn (6)34 represents the Tafel reaction. Taking the most widely used Ti3C2Ox as an example, in acidic electrolyte, the HER proceeds on the Ti3C2Ox catalyst via the Volmer–Tafel mechanism. Specifically, the –O functional group on the surface of Ti3C2Ox and the exposed Ti on the surface as active sites are protonated to –OH and Ti–H, respectively. Then, –OH and Ti–H are deprotonated to form H2, which is desorbed and diffused into the electrolyte to expose the –O and M active sites for the next catalytic cycle.37 Given that there is no barrier for the dissociation of water molecules, the covalent bond of H3O+ is destroyed under acidic condition, which is much weaker than the covalent bond of H–O–H destroyed under alkaline conditions. Thus, it is easier to realize the HER under the acidic condition, where the activity of the HER is 2–3 orders of magnitude higher than that under alkaline condition,34 which is consistent with the conclusion that the catalytic activity of the HER decreases with an increase in pH (potential of hydrogen) value. In both acidic and alkaline environments, the theoretical Tafel slopes of the Volmer, Heyrovsky and Tafel steps as the rate-limiting process are 120, 40 and 30 mV dec−1 (at room temperature), respectively. Among them, the MXene catalysts with the Heyrovsky step or Tafel step as the rate-determining step (RDS) exhibit the best HER performance. H+ + e− → Had(4) Had + H+ + e− → H2(5) Had + Had → H2(6)
In the actual electrocatalytic environment, different types of MXene materials may follow different HER mechanisms, and the same MXene material may even follow different HER mechanisms, depending on the inherent chemical and electrical properties of the MXene surface.38 Essentially, this is ascribed to the different bonding strengths between the active intermediate Had and MXenes, and the mechanism of the HER can be judged according to the Tafel slope. Therefore, the doping or modification of MXenes may change the catalytic mechanism of MXene-based catalysts. For example, the addition of a transition metal (TM) to MXenes can switch the HER mechanism from the original Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism to the Volmer–Tafel mechanism. This is related to the change in their surface electron configuration induced by the doped TM.39 Similarly, the combination of other materials with MXenes may also lead to a change in electrical properties or active sites on the MXene surface, causing a change in the HER catalytic mechanism. At present, a few MXene-based catalysts with excellent HER activity adopt the Volmer–Tafel mechanism, which are mainly MXenes combined with noble metals, such as PtOaPdOb/Ti3C2Tx40 and RuSA–N–Ti3C2Tx.41 Alternatively, most MXene-based catalysts with high HER activity adopt the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism, such as Mo2C/Ti3C2Tx@NC42 and Ni0.9Co0.1@Ti2.5Nb0.5C2Tx.43 In addition, very few MXene-based catalysts adopt a hybrid mechanism based on the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism and Volmer–Tafel mechanism, such as BNNS/Ti3C2.44 It should be noted that the energy barrier of the Volmer–Tafel mechanism for the HER on some MXene catalysts is very high, and thus the reaction proceeds via the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism with a very low reaction barrier.45 However, if the barrier of the Tafel reaction is smaller than that of the Heyrovsky reaction, the Volmer–Heyrovsky hybrid mechanism for the HER is more favorable.
In addition, some studies have indicated that the HER mechanism on nitride MXene-based catalysts may involve more complex catalytic reaction processes. For example, M–Ti4N3Tx may involve oxygen vacancies generated on the base surface as active sites (release of surface Tx functional groups) for the HER, but this has not been confirmed and needs to be further studied.46
2.2 OER mechanism of MXene-based catalysts
Oxygen is another product of overall water splitting, which is produced by the OER at the anode. This is the reverse reaction of the HER. However, due to the linear correlation between the intermediates of the OER, it is impossible to achieve independent optimization at a single site.47 Also, for the more complicated four-electron reaction, it needs to overcome the formation of a large electrochemical energy barrier in the OO double bond and slow kinetics, which is one of the important reasons leading to a low overall water splitting efficiency and energy conversion rate. Simultaneously, given that the reaction needs a high overpotential, the electrocatalyst is easily dissolved/corroded, and thus the stability requirements of the electrocatalyst are very high. At present, the most advanced and widely used OER electrocatalysts are noble metal oxides, such as RuO2 and IrO2. However, their high price, low abundance, easy oxidization and instability under harsh conditions (such as strong acid and strong alkali media) and inability to act as bifunctional materials make their commercialization challenging.48 Therefore, finding cheap, efficient and stable alternative catalysts has become a research hotspot in the field of overall water splitting.
The OER has different reaction paths under different pH electrolyte conditions, which are generally divided into OER under acidic condition and OER under alkaline (neutral) conditions. The reaction equations are also different, but they both involve the surface reconstruction of the catalyst to produce active substances and form active sites, such as the conversion of metal cations from low-valent states to active high-valent states to participate in catalysis. The OER reaction under alkaline (neutral) conditions is shown in eqn (20)49 and OH− will eventually be oxidized to H2O and O2. Alternatively, the OER reaction under acidic conditions is shown in eqn (18),49 and two H2O will eventually be oxidized into four H+ (protons) and O2. At present, the most recognized acidic and alkaline OER mechanism both involve the generation of OH* intermediates, and thus the presence of OH− will be beneficial for the OER. However, the strong HO–H covalent bond in H2O needs to be broken under acidic conditions to form OH*, and thus the reaction kinetics of the OER in alkaline conditions is more favorable. Simultaneously, there are much more types of alkaline OER catalysts are than acidic OER catalysts, and thus most of the research on the OER at present is based on alkaline condition. However, in some special applications, such as proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers, the acidic OER is superior (higher conductivity of hydronium ions than that for alkaline OER), while anion exchange membrane (AEM) technology based on alkaline electrolyte has some problems, such as low ionic conductivity, anion selectivity and membrane stability. The performance of AEM water electrolyzers is much lower than that of PEM water electrolyzers, which possesses many advantages, such as low ohmic loss,47 high current density, wide working temperature, high voltage efficiency, small battery area, high gas purity, fast system response, large partial load range, low cost stack development and compact system design.30 PEM water electrolyzers are suitable for practical applications, which is why the acidic OER can be developed at present.50
Given that the OER catalytic activity of MXene materials is very low, they are generally compounded with other materials to improve their OER activity. Therefore, the OER catalytic active sites of MXene-based materials are basically on other materials or at the interface of different composite materials. The OER mechanism strongly depends on the material compounded with MXenes, which will change depending on the composite material, and thus the OER catalytic mechanism is diverse. Given that there is a small obstacle to the dissociation of water molecules to produce oxygen under alkaline conditions, most OER studies are carried out in an alkaline environment. The catalytic mechanism of alkaline OER on MXene-based materials is complex. At present, the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) and lattice oxygen-mediated mechanism (LOM) are generally accepted. Most MXene-based catalysts follow the AEM, while a small amount-follow the LOM mechanism. Under alkaline conditions, the mechanism of the AEM is shown in Fig. 1c. Specifically, the OH− in aqueous solution is adsorbed on the active site to produce *OH (eqn (8),16 * is the active site), and then it undergoes a proton-coupled electron transfer process to produce *O (eqn (9)16). Two *O can be directly coupled to form O2 (eqn (10)16), and one *O can be further converted into *OOH (eqn (11)16), and then deprotonated to produce O2 (eqn (12)16). The activation energy of the OER is closely related to the interaction between the catalyst surface and reactants, products and oxygen-containing intermediates. However, the adsorption of the reactant (OH−) and the release of the product (O2) are not the rate-controlling steps for most OER electrocatalysts, and thus the combination of oxygen-containing intermediates (*OH, *O and *OOH) with active sites is very important. Generally, the binding strength between the oxygen-containing intermediate and the active site of the catalyst should not be too large or too small, i.e., it should be moderate to ensure the balance between adsorption and desorption. Regarding the four-electron pathway, the binding energy difference between *OOH and *OH is 3.2 ± 0.2 eV, and thus only either ΔG*OOH or ΔG*OH needs to be determined. Simultaneously, because the expected value of an ideal catalyst is 2.46 eV (2 × 1.23 eV), the minimum theoretical overpotential is 0.37 eV ([3.2–2.46 eV]/2).47 In addition, ΔG*O − ΔG*OH can be used as a descriptor of the OER activity of a catalyst, and overpotential ηOER = {max [(ΔGO* − ΔGHO*), 3.2 eV − (ΔGO* − ΔGHO*)]/e}, which is widely used in the study of the volcano plot (as shown in Fig. 1d). The top of volcano plot is the medium strength with the highest binding activity of 1.6 eV (according to the Sabatier principle, the adsorption strength of key intermediates of an ideal catalyst should not be too big or too small51). A catalyst in this area is the best catalyst for the OER. If it is located on the left side of the volcano, its oxygen binding is too strong, and eqn (11)16 will become the rate-controlling step. If it is located on the right side of the volcano, the oxygen binding is too weak, and eqn (9)16 will become the rate-controlling step. Both cases will limit the kinetics of the overall oxygen reduction reaction, leading to an increase in the OER overpotential. At this time, the value of ΔG*O − ΔG*OH can be optimized by adjusting the electronic structure of the catalyst surface.16 The methods to realize this adjustment include doping (for example, the oxygen binding energy is weakened by doping with electronegative elements), creation of anion and cation vacancies, alloying, strain adjustment52 (changing the bonding energy of the metal–oxygen bond) and interface engineering.1 This is because the linear relationship (eqn (7)47) between oxygen-containing intermediates (*OH, *O and *OOH) will cause their adsorption energies to affect each other, resulting in mutual inhibition between reaction steps (one step is strengthened, while others may be weakened), thus limiting the reaction activity and optimization of the catalyst, that is, the adsorption-energy scaling relationship leads to a relatively high overpotential.47 The above-mentioned adjustment method can change the surface of the catalyst and overcome the linear proportional relationship between them (the slope of the proportional relationship between *OH (*OOH) and *O is about 0.5, while that between *OOH (*OH) and *O is about 1.053), and thus the adsorption-energy scaling relationship can be overcome/avoided by changing the slope and intercept.47 ΔG2 = AΔG1 + B(7)where A is the slope of intermediate 1 and intermediate 2, which depends on the octet rule (electronic counting rule), and intercept B depends on the nearest counting rule and electronic counting rule. OH− + * → *OH + e−(8) *OH + OH− → *O + H2O + e−(9) *O + *O → O2(10) *O + OH− → *OOH + e−(11) *OOH + OH− → * + O2 + e− + H2O(12)
The LOM, as shown in Fig. 1e, is fundamentally due to the covalent nature of the metal–oxygen bond. The higher the covalent nature, the more favorable. This can be achieved by adjusting the electronic structure, which is mostly used to explain the OER process of metal oxides, considering O–O coupling (catalyst surface). Firstly, *OH will produce *OO and form an oxygen vacancy site at the oxygen anion site (eqn (13)16), and then *OO will react with H2O in the supercell and change back to *OH and release O2 (eqn (14)16), the adjacent surface lattice oxygen will be protonated and the oxygen vacancy will be occupied (eqn (15)16), and finally *OH will be regenerated by the deprotonation process (eqn (16)16) for the next oxygen reduction. The stronger the interaction between the electrolyte and metal cations on the surface, the faster MXene can obtain oxygen from aqueous solution to fill the oxygen vacancies, that is, the faster the surface reconstruction of MXene, the more favorable the LOM kinetics.54 *OH → (VO + *OO)⊗ + H+ + e−(13) (VO + *OO)⊗ + H2O → O2 + (VO + *OH)⊗ + H+ + e−(14) (VO + *OH)⊗ + H2O → (*HO-site + *OH)⊗ + H+ + e−(15) (*HO-site + *OH)⊗ → *OH + H+ + e−(16)
In the case of metal oxides, the main way to distinguish the two mechanisms is to observe the difference in energy bands. When the oxygen p-band of the metal oxide is higher than the metal d-band, electrons are more likely to transfer from the -former to the -latter and form oxygen vacancies, making the lattice oxygen atoms electrophilic, which belongs to the LOM mechanism. On the contrary, the metal d-band of the metal oxide at the top of the oxygen p-band is the AEM. Adjusting the AEM to the LOM can form a high covalent metal–oxygen bond by adjusting the surface electronic state.16 Grimaud et al.18 also proved that the metal–oxygen covalent bond is effective in controlling the reaction mechanism and OER activity through density functional theory (DFT) combined with chemical characterization. Simultaneously, they also proposed a new LOM mechanism for the OER based on perovskite, which is called the LOM–O mechanism (Fig. 1f and g). The main difference from the above-mentioned LOM–M mechanism is in the adsorption energy of *OH by the active sites (O and M). In addition, another study speculated that in an alkaline environment, MXene-based materials may also have unconventional bifunctional mechanism (BM) in addition to the above-mentioned AEM and LOM, involving the production of *OO and *H, but this has not been confirmed and needs to be further studied.55
At present, many types of catalytic mechanisms have been proposed for the acidic OER, as shown in Table 1, where * represents the active sites on the catalyst surface, where the reaction mechanisms of different catalysts may be different. Among them, the most commonly recognized OER catalytic mechanisms are the electrochemical oxidation pathway and oxidation pathway. Homogeneous and heterogeneous electrocatalysts are used in acid OER, involving the acid–base mechanism and direct coupling mechanism, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1h. The formation of the O–O bond is obviously different between the acid–base mechanism and direct coupling mechanism. In the case of heterogeneous catalysts, the ligand effect can also be used to adjust the strength of the metal–oxygen covalent bond to an appropriate value.56 In heterogeneous catalysis, the OER mechanism starts with the production of OH*, where * represents the active site, namely M, as shown in Fig. 1h, and then the active site is oxidized to produce the O* intermediate, namely, M–O. In the acid–base mechanism (dotted circle in Fig. 1h), the O* intermediate will be attacked by nucleophilic water, resulting in the formation of the OOH* intermediate and O–O bond. In the direct coupling mechanism, two adjacent O* intermediates will form an O–O bond through direct coupling or one O* intermediate and its adjacent OH* intermediate will produce an OOH* intermediate, which will then be further oxidized to produce OO* and form an O–O bond. The O–O produced by the latter two mechanisms will be replaced by water, and O–O will form O2 and be released.30

2.3 Water splitting mechanism of MXene-based catalysts
For overall water splitting, the HER at the cathode is a two-electron transfer reaction, while the OER at the anode is a proton–electron coupling reaction. The cathodic and anodic reactions of water splitting under acidic condition are shown as eqn (17) and (18),49 respectively. Also, the cathodic and anodic reactions under alkaline condition are presented as eqn (19) and (20),49 respectively. (17) (18) (19) (20)
Under the ideal condition, the voltage applied between two electrodes for water electrolysis is 1.23 V,61 above which the HER and OER can occur, producing hydrogen and oxygen gases, respectively. However, in practice, due to the low adsorption/desorption rates of the reactants, products and active intermediates on the surface of electrocatalysts and the existence of an electrochemical potential barrier, the required voltage is higher, and there is overpotential between the two poles. Because the OER is more complex, the overall water splitting reaction is mainly due to the high cathode overpotential (ηa > ηc, Fig. 2a), which leads to slow kinetics.49

Generally, it is difficult for water to overcome the huge energy barrier to produce hydrogen and oxygen without a catalyst. In this case, an electrocatalyst can improve the adsorption of reactants, promote the conversion of reactants to adsorption intermediates and products, act as a bridge for charge transfer between the electrodes and reactants, reduce the activation energy of the reaction, and thus make water electrolysis possible. At present, the commercial HER catalyst Pt/C and OER catalyst IrO2 or RuO2 have high catalytic activity for their reactions, but they can only be used as the active materials of the anode and cathode, respectively, and cannot realize the double functions of overall water splitting. Therefore, few catalysts can accelerate the HER and OER reactions in the same electrolyte at present,65 which increases the cost of electrolyzed water and complicates the system. At present, although the research on electrocatalysis using MXenes is in its infancy, the realization of dual-function HER/OER by MXenes, and even seawater splitting and hydrolysis in the full pH range has been reported, which will greatly simplify the design of electrolysis cell systems and the working conditions of the reaction.66 Furthermore, this will provide a new possible scheme for optimizing water electrolysis cell systems, improving the water electrolysis efficiency and reducing the cost of water electrolysis in the future.
The main dissociation steps of water on the surface of MXenes (0001) include the adsorption of water molecules on the surface of MXenes, dissociation of water molecules into OH and H, migration and diffusion of OH and H on the surface, and finally reaching their most stable adsorption sites, as shown in Fig. 2b. Gouveia et al.20 established the adsorption site model of M2X through first-principles calculations, as shown in Fig. 1i. Their study showed that the best site for H atom adsorption is in the center of the HM site (M means metal) and the adsorption of H on d2 transition metal-based MXenes is stronger than that of d3 or d4 transition metal-based MXenes, while H adsorption has little relationship with whether the MXene is nitride or carbide. The adsorption of OH is perpendicular to the surface and O is closer to the surface of MXenes, and thus the selection of adsorption sites is more complicated, which depends on the MXene and is related to the type of X (C/N) (Table 220). Simultaneously, their study also showed that the adsorption configuration and electronic structure can be changed by changing the type, atomic number and/or stoichiometry of X (C/N). At the T site, the water molecule plane is adsorbed perpendicular to the surface of MXenes, while at the B site, the water molecule plane is adsorbed parallel to the surface of MXenes (Fig. 2c). Therefore, it is more difficult to dissociate the water molecules adsorbed at the T site, which requires a larger energy barrier. However, the energy required for the water molecules adsorbed at T site to transfer to the B site is higher than the dissociation energy of the T site, and thus MXenes adsorbed at the T site generally does not migrate to the B site. Also, it was shown that the dissociation energy of water on the surface of MXenes is between 0.05 and 0.44 eV, which is relatively easier to dissociate. The dissociation energy of MXenes on d2 transition metals is lower than that on d3 or d4 transition metals, while dissociation on a carbide surface is easier than that on a nitride surface. Therefore, d2 transition metal-based carbide MXenes have excellent water electrolysis activity. The molecular mechanism of hydrolysis ionization chemisorption can reveal the adsorption energy, as follows: Eads = E(S/MXene) − (EMXene + ES), where EMXene represents the energy of the MXene non-adsorbed species, E(S/MXene) represents the energy of MXene adsorbed S species, and ES represents the energy of isolated species. In the process of overall water splitting, the commonly adsorbed species are H and OH, EH = 1/2EH2, EOH = EH2O − 1/2EH2.20

At present, due to the slow kinetic bottleneck of overall water splitting (high overpotential, low efficiency and high energy loss) and the use of high-cost and unstable noble metal catalysts, the economic benefits of overall water splitting are very low, accounting for less than 5% of the current market, which lag far behind the industrialized steam methane reforming (SMR) or other methods.27 However, production methods such as catalytic reforming consume fossil energy, not only aggravating the energy crisis, but also causing environmental pollution. Therefore, scientists have begun to turn their attention to the clean and renewable method of water electrolysis. In this case, MXene-based electrocatalysts can be used as both cathode and anode catalysts to catalyze the HER and OER to produce hydrogen and oxygen, respectively, which may replace traditional noble metal catalysts and change the competitive disadvantage of water electrolysis. Here, we present the outstanding research on MXene-based electrocatalytic materials for the HER/OER/OWS in the past five years.
The research on the electrocatalysis of the HER by MXenes shows that the catalytic activity of pure MXenes is related to the functional groups present on their surface, with their catalytic activity from high to low following the order of –O > –OH > –F, and thus the active site of MXenes may be the terminal oxygen on the surface. The catalytic activity of MXenes is also related to the type of transition metals in their composition. At present, among the numerous MXene materials, Mo2CTx and Ti3C2Tx67 exhibit excellent properties (Tx represents a functional group on the surface of MXenes). This is because the orbitals of s and p in Mo2CTx are hybridized with the d orbitals of Mo, which have a d-band electronic structure similar to Pt.68 The adsorption strength of the intermediate H* is also suitable, neither too strong nor too weak,67 and ΔGH* = 0.03 eV at the edge of the Mo site, while Ti3C2Tx shows superior durability and electron channel, and thus it can be utilized as a carrier with good corrosion resistance. Compounding MXenes with other materials or modifying their surface is an effective means to improve their catalytic activity. This is because MXenes can form interface coupling with other materials, thus producing a synergistic effect, optimizing their electronic structure, improving their ΔGH* value to promote the adsorption and desorption of the intermediate H*,65 and promoting the charge/substance transport.4 In these studies, MXene is combined with monatomic transition metals. Especially, the catalytic activity of MXenes combined with noble metal single-atom materials approaches that of the most advanced HER electrode material (Pt/C electrode) at present, while the catalytic performance of the material or electrode modified as a 3D structure can even exceed that of the Pt/C electrode. In addition, according to theory, there are 110 types of 2D ordered binary alloy (OBA) MXenes that have not been developed in the laboratory, which have thermal stability and excellent HER electrocatalytic performance over Pt catalysts (Table 3).69

The OER catalytic performance of catalysts is closely related to the number of active sites and intrinsic activity1 and depends on their electronic configuration, particle size and structure. Generally, the OER catalytic activity of MXene materials is very low, and even negligible. However, MXenes can be used as a good conductive matrix to combine with other OER catalysts, such as Ni-based catalysts, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with excellent electrocatalytic performance, which not only can solve the problems of poor conductivity, easy agglomeration and few active sites of these catalysts, but also produce a synergistic effect, change the electronic structure of the active sites, reduce the energy required for the OER and improve the catalytic activity of the catalysts. Simultaneously, doping, such as P and S can change the structure and electronic state of the catalyst and further improve the catalytic activity of the composites. Therefore, the active sites of MXene-based OER catalysts are mostly doped materials or composite materials (Table 4).

The combination of MXenes and other materials can realize multifunctional catalysts, which cannot be realized by commercial noble metal catalysts, and can be directly utilized as anode and cathode catalytic materials to electrolyze water to produce hydrogen and oxygen. During the electrolysis process, the good hydrophilicity of MXenes can make the catalyst fully contact with water, which is conducive to the adsorption of water molecules. Simultaneously, MXenes have a large specific surface area and high conductivity, which can produce interface coupling with other catalysts. changing the coordination environment and electronic structure of other catalysts, greatly improving their catalytic activity. At present, although some progress has been made in the research of overall water splitting based on MXenes, and the performance of some MXene-based catalysts approaches or even exceeds that of electrolysis devices assembled by Pt/C and RuO2, most of the research is carried out under alkaline conditions, which are conducive to the slow kinetics of the OER, whereas there are few studies in acidic conditions, full pH range, or even in seawater. There are few studies on overall water splitting at a large current density suitable for commercialization. Most of the studies are based on several basic early MXene-based catalysts, and thus the research on other MXene or nitride MXene catalysts (carbonitride MXene) needs to be further expanded (Table 5).

2.4 Electrocatalytic performance evaluation index for MXene-based catalysts
For the same reaction, the different electrocatalysts have different catalytic effects, and thus it is necessary to employ some parameters to describe the performance of electrocatalysts, as follows:
(1) Overpotential (η): To reach the specific current density, the actual reaction will overcome the electrode kinetic barrier and apply a value higher than the equilibrium potential of the reaction (η = E − Eeq, where E can be expressed by the Nernst equation), that is, the extra voltage applied to drive the electrochemical reaction, which is higher than the thermodynamic requirement, is one of the important evaluation indexes of catalytic activity.109 For the same current density (j), the smaller η, the better the catalytic performance of the electrocatalyst.
(2) Tafel slope (b): The increasing speed of the current density relative to the overpotential (η), that is, the overpotential increment required for the current density to increase tenfold. This can be calculated using the linear sweep voltammetry curve (LSV) and Tafel equation (eqn (21),110,111eqn (22) and (23)49), which reflects the electrocatalytic process dynamics, is closely related to the reaction mechanism, and is an intuitive expression of catalytic activity.60 Generally, with a smaller b, the desired current density can be achieved under a small overpotential, and the faster the reaction rate, the better the electrocatalytic kinetics and the better the catalytic performance of the electrocatalyst. For the multi-electron transfer process, the Tafel slope can also provide valuable insights into the rate-determining steps and the possible reaction pathways.49 η = blogj + a(21) (22) (23)where η, b, i and i0 represent the overpotential, Tafel slope, current density and exchange current density, and α, R, T and F represent the transfer coefficient, gas constant, temperature and Faraday constant, respectively.
(3) Charge transfer resistance (Rct): This can be calculated by performing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The smaller the Rct, the easier the charge transfer, the faster the electrocatalysis rate and the better the catalytic performance of the electrocatalyst.112
(4) Turnover frequency (TOF): This is an important index to evaluate the intrinsic activity of the catalyst, which can be determined for each active site,2 where the higher the TOF value, the better the activity. TOF is defined as the electrochemical conversion rate of each electrocatalytic site at a certain overpotential, allowing the comparison between different materials, regardless of their actual geometric parameters or area load. Unfortunately, it is very challenging to accurately calculate the TOF values of most electrocatalysts, except for some special cases where the active sites (such as Pt and Pd) on the surface of the materials can be clearly quantified, due to the structural ambiguity of the active sites. Many studies often assume that all the added catalysts effectively participate in the catalytic reaction. Therefore, the TOF values are often underestimated (sometimes even orders of magnitude), but they can still provide some information on intrinsic activity. The TOF can be calculated using the following equation:113 TOF (s−1) = (j × A)(2 × F × n)(24) (25)where j (mA cm−2) represents the current density (under different overpotentials), A is the geometric surface area of the electrode, F is the Faraday constant, the factor 1/2 is the number of electrons needed to make a hydrogen molecule, n (mol) is the number of active sites obtained by cyclic voltammetry (CV), and Qs is half of the integrated charge in the whole potential range.
(5) Interchange current density (i0): The intercept value (j0 = ja = −jc, Fig. 2d) under balanced conditions, that is, η = 0, E = Eeq, the two electrode currents are equal (ja = jc), and the total static current is 0. Generally, the exchange current (j0) is divided by the electrode area (A) and converted into the exchange current density (i0 = j0/A). The exchange current density (i0) reflects the bonding/charge transfer between the reactants and electrocatalysts, where the higher the value, the better the catalytic performance of the electrocatalysts.49
(6) Free energy of adsorption intermediate H* (ΔGH*): According to the Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi relationship, the adsorption energy of hydrogen is linearly related to the activation energy of the HER, and thus the adsorption capacity of hydrogen, that is, ΔGH*, is the key descriptor to evaluate the catalytic activity of HER catalysts,66 and it is the best when its value is equal to 0 eV. At this time, the H* intermediate is easily adsorbed and desorbed at the active sites on the catalyst surface, and the material activity is the highest. For example, at present, the HER catalyst with the best performance is Pt, and its ΔGH* value is 0.09 eV, η10 = 23 mV (η10 represents the overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm−2). The volcano plot, as shown in Fig. 2e, can be obtained by drawing the correlation between the value of exchange current density j0/η and the value of ΔGH*, which can be used for theoretical research to visually express and compare the properties of materials. The better the properties of a material, the closer it is to the top of volcano, that is, the position where ΔGH* = 0 eV and the exchange current density (j0) is the largest. If it is located on the left side of the volcano plot, that is, ΔGH* < 0 eV, it means that the bond between the catalyst and hydrogen (Cat–H bond) containing an intermediate product is too strong, which will limit the Heyrovsky reaction/Tafel reaction and is not conducive to the release of hydrogen. If it is located on the right side of the volcano plot, that is, ΔGH* > 0 eV, it means that the bond between the catalyst and hydrogen (Cat–H bond)-containing intermediate product is too weak, which will limit the Volmer reaction. It should be noted that the volcano plot is a simplified model, without considering the influence of the double layer and solvation effect.114 In some studies, the whole HER pathway is represented by a three-state diagram (Fig. 2f), which can be divided into three states, including the initial state of H+ + e−, the intermediate state of adsorbing Had and the final state of producing 1/2 H2. Similarly, the activity of a catalyst is judged according to the free energy of its intermediate state, that is, whether ΔGH* is close to 0 eV and ΔGH* > 0 eV.36
(7) Cyclic stability: Besides its catalytic activity, any electrocatalyst should have sufficient long-term stability to be considered for practical applications. This is usually evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), constant current or constant potential polarization. In addition, Cherevko and colleagues proposed a stability index (S number), which is independent of surface area, active site and loading by combining OER catalytic mechanism and dissolution mechanism to evaluate the stability of different catalysts. When applied to study iridium oxide based on perovskite, the S number is defined as the ratio of the total amount of oxygen released to the dissolved amount of iridium, and the higher the value, the more stable the active center.115
(8) ΔG*O – ΔG*OH: This is used to evaluate the catalytic activity of OER catalysts, which is the best when its value is equal to 1.6 eV, and the material activity is the highest. With the help of the linear scaling relationship among the three intermediates *O, *OH and *OOH47, it is necessary to determine the adsorption free energy difference between two intermediates. The volcano plot can be obtained by drawing the correlation between the value of exchange current density j0/η and ΔG*O − ΔG*OH.
(9) Electric double layer capacitance (CdI): This can be used to analyze the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) and determine the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of active sites or the exposure rate of active sites. Generally, the larger the CdI, the more active sites are exposed, and the better the electrocatalytic activity.
(10) d-band center: For transition metals, the d-band theory116 and the center of d-band are the basis for judging the adsorption strength. Adsorbents will hybridize with metal d-orbitals to form bonding orbitals, σ, with lower energy than the two orbitals and anti-bonding orbitals, σ*, with higher energy than the two orbitals. Generally, the less electrons are filled in the anti-bonding orbitals, the lower the system energy, and the more favorable the adsorption, while the occupancy of the anti-bonding orbitals will increase with a decrease in the center of the d-band, which will lead to a decrease in the adsorption strength of the intermediates.117 Specifically, when the center of the d-band is far from the Fermi level, the lower the σ* energy level, the higher the σ* occupancy, and the weaker the adsorption of the intermediates.36 At this time, the ligand effect118 or stress effect119 can be produced by doping or compounding to adjust the electronic structure of the catalyst surface to adjust the center of the d-band, causing the adsorption intensity to be as close as possible to the tip of the volcano plot. For the HER, when the center energy of the d-band is at the Fermi level, the activation barrier required for H–H bond cleavage is the lowest (Fig. 2g).64
Besides, there are some other descriptors including the filling of eg track,120 OH–M2+δ bond strength, p-band center,121 metal–oxygen covalency,122 number of outer electrons, bulk thermochemistry, degree of geometric tilting, coordinatively unsaturated metal cation (MCUS), magnetic moment, generalized electronegativity,123 charge transfer energy, surface distortion,124 and electrochemical-step symmetry index (ESSI). Among them, the higher the eg occupancy rate, the weaker the binding force of oxygen, and vice versa.1
3. Modification or compounding of MXene-based catalysts for water splitting
3.1 Doping of MXene catalysts
Doping is an effective method to improve the catalytic activity of MXenes, which can change their electronic structure, element composition and periodic network structure,125 promote the redistribution of their surface charge or change their spin distribution, and lower the reaction energy barrier. Some doped atoms can even expand the interlayer spacing of MXenes, thus increasing the active surface area of electrocatalytic reaction.126 The doped atoms can be metals, such as Nb and Co, or nonmetals, such as N and P. To date, there are two types of doping forms for MXenes, i.e., one is the non-in situ strategy of directly using the substance to be doped to interact with the base material (such as electrostatic adsorption), and the other is the in situ strategy of directly reacting and growing the dopant on MXene.125

3.1.1 Metal doping. 
Doping with a transition metal (TM), such as Nb, Ni and Co, will ease the strong interaction between H and O and optimize the adsorption of intermediates by transferring electrons from TM to O on the surface of MXenes. Simultaneously, the doped transition metals may form new reaction sites, which is helpful to improve the catalytic activity. By changing the type, content and coverage of the doped transition metals, the ΔGH* value of MXenes can be close to 0 eV. Ling et al. studied the effect of Ni, Fe and Co doping on the HER performance of a V-based MXene (V2CO2) using first-principles.127 The results showed that the HER performance of V2CO2 doped with Ni, Fe and Co improves to varying degrees. Among them, Ni-doped V2CO2 has the best performance because Ni doping improves the strong adsorption of H by V2CO2. The research by Cheng et al. showed that the doping of Cr2CO2 with transition metals Ni and Co will affect the hydrogen coverage rate on its surface,128 and the hydrogen coverage rate is inversely proportional to the adsorption strength between intermediate H* and terminating functional group –O. Therefore, the hydrogen coverage rate can be adjusted by adjusting the proportion of doped transition metal atoms, causing the value of ΔGH* to approach 0 eV, because the doping of transition metals can provide electrons for O atoms (Fig. 3a). The electron filling of the anti-bonding orbitals (σ*) generated by the hybridization of H 1s orbitals and O 2pz orbitals will increase, the electrons obtained by O* from H* will decrease, and the interaction between them will weaken (Fig. 3b). The strong adsorption of H*, which is the original intermediate of Cr2CO2, will be relieved, and |ΔGH*| will decrease. Simultaneously, it is also found that the catalytic effect of Ni is better than that of Co because the electronegativity of Ni is larger than that of Co, the bonding between Ni and O atoms on the surface is stronger, the interaction between H* and O* is weakened, and ΔGH* is reduced. Kuznetsov et al. used a peculiar method to form β-Mo2C:Co and inserted Ga into it, then etched the Ga layer by the traditional HF etching method, and finally doped the middle and late transition metal Co in Mo2CTx to occupy the site of Mo, forming the Mo2CTx:Co solid solution material.129 The electrocatalytic HER of Mo2CTx:CO was carried out under the condition of 1.0 M H2SO4, which required an overpotential of 180 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm−2. This is because although the doping of Co will not create new active sites, it can improve the hydrogen binding energy of the nearby oxygen atoms, thus making it easier to electrolyze water to produce hydrogen. Simultaneously, this previously unreported non-post-treatment method to obtain doped MXenes provides more possibilities for the preparation of doped MXene materials.

The effect of doping late transition metal on MXenes in the process of electrocatalytic HER/OER was studied by Anand et al. by first-principles and machine learning (ML) descriptors.54 Firstly, they calculated all the original MXenes without doping and found out that the materials with the best HER performance are M3X2O2 and M2M′X2O2, between which the OER catalytic activity of M3X2O2 is relatively low. Then, according to the types or combinations of M and M′ and the different mechanisms, 66 types of M3X2O2 (including three H adsorption sites, i.e., S1-top, S2-hcp, and S3-fcc) and 220 types of M2M′X2O2 (H adsorption sites are mainly S1) were doped (Fig. 3c–e). There are two ways of doping, i.e., the single atom is adsorbed on the stable vacancy above the external oxygen layer of MXenes, which is called SAC1, or the metal layer of MXenes on the sub-surface is replaced by other transition metal single atoms, i.e., SAC2 (Fig. 3f). The former OER mechanism based on MXenes only follows the AEM (Fig. 3g), while the latter requires a higher adsorption free energy to support unstable AEM due to the higher covalent degree of M–O bond and OH* bond, and thus the OER mechanism based on MXenes follows the LOM–M and LOM–O mechanisms (Fig. 3h and i, respectively). It was also found that doping MXenes with Ni or Co will increase the O 2p band and activate the LOM. It was predicted that Ni-doped Nb3C2O2, especially Sc3N2O2, has excellent HER/OER bifunctional catalytic activity and stability, and is a potential electrocatalyst for overall water splitting.
In addition to HER research in acidic electrolyte, the HER in alkaline condition is also essential. Du et al. doped the transition metal Ti layer of Ti3C2Tx with Nb and modified it with Ni/Co alloy,43 designed and synthesized a series of nano-hybrids (Ni/Co@NTM), and used these materials for alkaline electrocatalytic HER (1.0 M KOH). The research showed that the Ni0.9Co0.1@Ti2.5Nb0.5C2Tx material stands out among the nano-hybrids. This catalyst showed excellent HER catalytic activity, with the overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 of 43.4 mV (Fig. 4a) and Tafel slope of 116 mV dec−1 (Fig. 4b). It could achieve 50 h stability at a constant current density of 10 mA cm−2. This is because before doping, the d-band electrons are mainly in the 3d state of Ti, while after doping with Nb, the peak of 4d state of Nb appears near the Fermi level of MXene, at which time the Fermi level moves up to the conduction band, thus improving the electronic conductivity and making ΔGH* close to zero. Simultaneously, the surface modification of Ni/Co alloy can alleviate the excessive M–H bonding strength on the surface, which will further improve the catalytic activity of the HER.

3.1.2 Nonmetallic doping. 
The catalytic activity of MXenes has a certain relationship with the number of layers of MXenes. The smaller the number of layers, the larger the specific surface area, and the more exposed the active sites. Therefore, the synthesized MXenes are usually ultrasonically stripped by organic matter to obtain MXenes with fewer layers, such as tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH), n-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMA·OH), and dimethylformamide (DMF). However, the presence of organic intercalation agents may affect the surface active sites of MXenes. Most of the nonmetals are doped with low electronegativity nonmetals (N, S, and P), which is an effective method to change the adsorption strength of the surface of MXenes to the reaction intermediates after delamination and to improve their conductivity and catalytic activity. Some nonmetals are doped at the position of functional groups in the process of obtaining MXenes by MAX etching, but this needs to be carried out at a higher temperature for most, which may destroy the structure of MXenes. Low-temperature plasma technology can realize the stratification and doping of MXenes simultaneously, exposing more active sites at the same time, and thus the number of nitrogen-doped sites can be increased. Because the reaction is carried out at low temperature, the structure of MXenes will not be destroyed. Therefore, Chen et al. obtained layered N–Ti3C2 MXene by NH3/Ar dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma treatment (Fig. 4c).130 The main principle of stratification and doping is to use the decomposition of NH4HCO3 under plasma conditions to produce a large amount of gases (ammonia, carbon dioxide, and water vapor), destroy the van der Waals force between the layers of MXene, and obtain MXene with fewer layers. The metastable nitrogen atoms formed by ammonia were doped in MXene in the form of lattice substitution (LS) of carbon atoms, functional substitution (FS) of nitrogen for –OH and nitrogen by –O terminal absorption (SA) (Fig. 4d and e). It was found that the plasma treatment time and volume ratio of NH3 to Ar could affect the conductivity, structure and nitrogen content of MXene. When the volume ratio of NH3 to Ar was 6:1 and the treatment time was 10 min, the grain size of Ti3C2 was the largest, the lattice spacing was the largest (Fig. 4f), the nitrogen content was the highest, and the water electrolysis performance was the best. When the current density was 10 mA cm−2, the overall water decomposition voltage under alkaline conditions was only 1.72 V, and the HER and OER overpotentials were 119.17 mV and 1.59 V, respectively. Also, the Tafel slopes were 61.81 mV dec−1 and 76.68 mV dec−1, respectively. This is because DFT study found that the HER follows the Volmer–Tafel step. The ΔGs of LS and FS was 2.78 eV and 0.92 eV, respectively, which are higher than that of SA (0.83 eV) (Fig. 4g). Therefore, SA had the greatest impact on the coordination environment of the MXene surface and changed the speed control step, and the effect of reducing the reaction energy barrier was the best, and thus the catalytic activity of MXene was the best. When the volume ratio of NH3 and Ar was 6:1, the content of SA was the highest. Simultaneously, the plasma treatment time of 10 min not only avoided the oxidation of Ti3C2 caused by the transition treatment, produced a large number of TiO2 and reduced the conductivity of MXene, but also obtained a more suitable amount of nitrogen and avoided the incomplete nitrogen doping caused by a shorter reaction time.130 Lv et al. prepared the Co2P/N@Ti3C2Tx@NF composite via electrodeposition and nitridation (Fig. 4h).27 This material was used to electrolyze water under alkaline condition. When j was 10 mA cm−2, the HER overpotential was 15 mV, the Tafel slope was 30 mV dec−1, charge transfer impedance, Rct, was 0.19 Ω, and CdI was 37.5 mF cm−2.
Nitrogen doping can change the direction of charge transfer from the former way (from CoP to MXene) to MXene and CoP to CoN (Fig. 4i), which can improve the conductivity of MXene and make Co2P have more defects, and thus more edge active sites can be exposed. DFT calculations showed that the Co2P/N@Ti3C2Tx@NF composite has excellent ΔGH2O and ΔGH* values (Fig. 4j and 5a), which are beneficial for the adsorption of H2O and the desorption of H*, respectively. This is because the interaction between the Co atom and O bond is strengthened and the interaction between the catalyst and H is weakened.27 Lu et al. studied the mechanism of N doping and found that the nitrogen was mainly doped in three ways for Ti3C2Tx MXene,131 including lattice substitution (LS) for carbon; functional substitution (FS) for –OH; and nitrogen is absorbed at the –O termination on the MXene surface (SA), with the formation energies of −1.31, −4.71 and −2.87 eV, respectively. Simultaneously, it was found that the formation of carbon vacancy and –OH vacancy is very difficult, and the activation energy of 10.25 eV and 4.23 eV is needed to overcome the transition state (Fig. 5b), respectively. The formation energy of surface absorption is negative for most positions, and thus it is more favorable. Through theoretical simulation, it was found that the nitrogen doping can further improve the conductivity and specific capacitance of Ti3C2Tx because the nitrogen adsorbed on the surface is beneficial for the formation of the Ti–O–N bond and the strong chemical interaction (strong bond) between nitrogen atoms and –O termination and Ti atoms, and the contribution of nitrogen doping to the increase in interlayer spacing.

In addition to N doping, P doping is also a good choice, which can weaken the strength of the M–H bond between the transition metal M in MXene and H, and thus the strong adsorption of hydrogen can be weakened, and reasonable regulation can make ΔGH* close to 0 eV.134 V2CTx itself does not have HER activity. When the current density is 10 mA cm−2, it showed a very high HER overpotential (760 mV). However, it can induce the formation of a P–C bond by doping other heteroatoms, forming active sites, appropriately reducing the adsorption strength of the intermediate, optimizing the desorption of the intermediate,126 and realizing a qualitative change in HER catalytic activity. Yoon et al. designed P–V2CTx material by phosphorizing the MXene surface with triphenylphosphine (TPP) (Fig. 5c and d).132 The results showed that phosphorus doping could be controlled by changing the reaction temperature. The HER catalytic activity was the best at 300 °C. Under the acidic condition of 0.5 M H2SO4, when the current density was 10 mA cm−2, the HER overpotential of P3–V2CTx was 163 mV with the Tafel slope of 74 mV dec−1 (Fig. 5e). Besides, the j0 was −7.17 mA cm−2, Rct was 159.86 Ω, CdI was 139.2 mF cm−2 and TOF was 0.2378 s−1 (100 mV). Through a 24 h j–t performance test, the overpotential of MXene only increased by 0.5 mV, which was due to the doping/substitution of P in the V vacancies and defects or surface–O functional groups changed the electronic structure of the MXene and improved its interlayer spacing, while also retaining its original hexagonal structure (Fig. 5f), and thus greatly expanding its specific surface area (about 4 times). A stable P–C bond was formed between V2CTx and C, which promoted the effective transport of electron/matter. The larger size and volume of P doping resulted in steric hindrance on the surface of V2CTx and the migration of H* to the metastable sites. Also, |ΔGH*| (0.020 eV) was closer to 0 (Fig. 5g), which effectively alleviated the effect of V2CTx on the active intermediate H.132

3.2 Surface modification or defect regulation of MXene catalysts

3.2.1 Regulation of functional group on the surface of MXenes. 
The surface of MXenes is rich in functional groups, which can be modified by changing the preparation method or using some post-treatment methods to adjust the type and number of functional groups.135 The functional groups on the surface of MXenes will affect their electrical properties. For example, the ideal MXenes without functional groups are metal, while that with functional groups is semiconductor, such as Ti2CO2, Zr2CO2, and Ti3C2F.136 Therefore, removing the functional groups on the surface of MXenes can improve their electrical conductivity, but it will also lead to a very unstable state on their surface, which is easily oxidized and inactivated. Simultaneously, different types of functional groups have different effects on the electrical properties of the same MXene material. For example, Sc2C(OH)2 is a direct bandgap semiconductor with a bandgap of 0.45 eV, while SC2F2 and Sc2CO2 are indirect bandgap semiconductors with a bandgap of 1.03 and 1.8 eV, respectively,15 which will cause differences in d-band electronic structure and density of states (DOS), resulting in a difference in catalytic performance. Studies have shown that with an increase in the type of –F functional groups on the surface of MXenes, their HER catalytic performance will gradually decrease, indicating that –F makes H difficult to desorb and inhibit the HER catalytic activity of MXene,11 and some studies have shown that –O or O in –OH is the active site of H adsorption, which may be the effect of –OH and –O termination on the electronic state of MXenes, and thus it has high thermodynamic stability.66 The mechanism is that the combination of H 1s and O 2pz orbitals produces a bonding orbital (σ) and an anti-bonding orbital (σ*) (Fig. 5h), where the former is in the state of complete electron occupation. When the number of electrons obtained by O is larger, that is, the gain number of oxygen atoms (Ne) is larger (Fig. 5i), more electrons occupy the antibonding orbital, and the weaker the adsorption strength of the intermediate, that is, ΔGH* decreases linearly with an increase in σ*, and the catalytic activity for the HER is better.
In addition, the descriptors of H* adsorption can also be oxygen vacancy formation energy (Ef, considering local structural rearrangement)137 and O-p band center (βp).138 There is a certain correlation between them and electron surface O atom gain (Ne).133 When Ne and Ef are larger, βp (Eb) decreases, and the adsorption of H atoms on MXene will be weakened (Fig. 6a). Although the termination of –O is beneficial for the HER process on MXenes, excessive –O functional groups inevitably lead to the oxidative degradation of MXenes, destroying their structure and degrading their electrocatalytic performance. Therefore, the coating coverage control of –O functional groups on the surface of MXenes is very important. Persson et al. conducted an exclusive termination experiment.139 The –F functional group on the surface of MXene was successfully removed under vacuum and high temperature conditions, and the treated MXene was exposed to controllable O2 to make the –O termination on the surface reach a certain degree of supersaturation. It was found that when the supersaturation at the end of –O was χ = 3.48 (temperature was 400 °C), Ti3C2Tx MXene exhibited an excellent catalytic effect to the maximum extent, while ensuring its structural integrity. In addition, studies have shown that the functional groups on the surface of MXenes can capture and anchor metal atoms (such as –O and –OH) through M–O bonds, or synergistically with metal atoms to capture metal atoms and improve their catalytic performance (such as –F).140

Kamysbayev et al. designed Ti3C2 MXene materials with surface functional groups of –O, –NH, –S, –Cl, –Se, –Br and –Te through surface exchange reaction generated by molten salt etching.143 It was found that the presence of surface functional groups of MXene could also cause in-plane lattice expansion, resulting in strain generation. Therefore, strain engineering could be carried out by using the regulation of functional groups. Simultaneously, functional groups would also affect the superconducting state of the material. For Nb2CTx, when the surface functional groups were –Cl, –S, –Se and –NH, they all showed superconducting properties. When the surface functional group was –O, it did not show superconducting properties.


3.2.2 Adjustment of inherent defects in MXenes. 
Because the adsorption of the active intermediates on MXenes is too strong or weak, the internal defects in MXenes are beneficial for the adjustment of electronic structure to further improve their surface properties, which leads to the weakening of strong adsorption and the strengthening of weak adsorption, thus accelerating the electrocatalytic kinetics and improving the electrocatalytic activity. Simultaneously, this may increase the density of catalytic sites and affect the intrinsic conductivity of the material. The type, location, distribution and concentration of defects have different effects on the electrocatalytic overall water splitting performance of MXene-based materials. Generally, the inherent defects (internal defects) of MXenes are divided into two types, i.e., atomic vacancy defects and active edge defects (caused by pores or edges in MXene nanosheets).125
Atomic vacancies are generally caused by the separation of atoms from the MXene materials during the preparation of MXene raw materials, which include carbon or nitrogen vacancies (CV/NV) and transition metal vacancies (MV).144 Different types of vacancies have different effects on MXenes. For example, the carbon vacancy in Ti2CTx can improve its mechanical flexibility and electrical conductivity, while the Ti vacancy in Ti3C2Tx does not affect its metal conductivity, but affects its surface functional groups and surface morphology. Simultaneously, it is necessary to consider whether the transition metal is the active site. For example, Mo in Mo2CTx is an active site. If too much Mo is missing, the coordination structure will change, and the performance of the material will decrease. The W–C bond is one of the strongest bonds, and WC may be an effective electrocatalyst. Meshkian et al. designed and synthesized the W1.33C MXene with W vacancy (WV) ordering by stoichiometric ratio mixed element powder sintering.145 Although its HER performance was not satisfactory (η10 = 320 mV for annealed W1.33C), it breaks the limitations of MXene currently only based on Ti, V, Nb, Mo, Cr, Zr, Hf and/or Ta. A new member of the MXene family, W-based MXene, was added. Using their method, more MXene types (such as i-MXene146) can be expanded and the electrocatalytic materials with ordered vacancies can be obtained.
Lind et al. also studied ordered transition metal vacancies.141 They studied Mo1.33C MXene and Nb1.33C MXene in addition to W1.33C MXene, and they found that Mo1.33C had the best HER performance (Fig. 6b). The first-principles calculations showed that although the existence of vacancies can lead to the generation of thermodynamically unfavorable vacancy adsorption H, under the condition of high cathodic potential, due to the existence of energy barriers, chemically bonded H atoms generated by H+ will exist in the vacancies in the metastable state without migration, making the surface H atom ΔGH* closer to 0 eV. Under the anode condition, the hydrogen atom will return to H+ and leave a vacancy because of the loss of electrons, resulting in a decrease in ΔGH*. Cheng et al. studied the effect of the concentration of carbon vacancies (CVs) on the electrocatalytic HER performance of Cr2CO2 (Fig. 6c).128 It was found that in the low concentration range (<25%) and the same hydrogen coverage, with a decrease in the concentration of carbon vacancies, ΔGH* will increase (according to positive and negative), and the binding between H atoms and MXene will be weakened, and thus a low concentration of carbon vacancies (<25%) is beneficial to improve the catalytic activity for the HER.
Hu et al. found that carbon vacancies can maintain stability at room temperature.142 Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation, the effects of carbon vacancy on the electrical conductivity and mechanical properties of Ti2CT2 were studied. The results showed that carbon vacancies can improve the density of states (DOS) and Fermi level (EF) of Ti2CT2 (Fig. 6d), reduce the stiffness of MXene by 17%, and increase their flexibility significantly (Fig. 6e). Gan et al. studied the effect of CVs and MVs on the HER catalytic activity of M2CO2 MXene by DFT calculation.147 It was found that carbon vacancies (CVs) can cause a decrease in the O electronic state and Fermi level on the surface of M2CO2 MXene and weaken the interaction between H atoms and O atoms, that is, H adsorption is weakened, while transition metal vacancies (MVs) can cause an increase in the O electronic state and Fermi level on the surface of M2CO2 MXene and enhance the interaction between H atoms and O atoms, that is, H adsorption is enhanced (Fig. 7a). Therefore, without affecting the intrinsic activity of the MXene, the hydrogen adsorption on the M2CO2 surface can be adjusted by adjusting the type and number of vacancies. The introduction of carbon vacancies can alleviate the adsorption of MXenes (Ti2CO2, Nb2CO2 or W2CO2) with strong hydrogen adsorption, MXene (Ta2CO2, Fig. 7b) with weak hydrogen adsorption due to the transition metal vacancies, or the coupling of two vacancies can alleviate the adsorption of MXenes (Zr2CO2 and Hf2CO2) with weak intrinsic hydrogen adsorption, and thus the value of ΔGH* is close to 0 eV.

Some MXene materials with good activity, such as Mo2CTx, have shown that the transition metal at the edge is a catalytic active site compared with the transition metal on the base (such as Mo). The number of active sites can be increased by narrowing the material dimension, such as the transformation of 2D MXene nanosheets into 1D nanomaterial or 0D quantum dots and forming porous structures. Simultaneously, the active sites such as MoS2 and Co2P in the composite materials using MXenes are mostly on the edge, and thus is necessary to expose more edge sites, which can be realized by vertical growth and other methods.
Han et al. fabricated Ti3C2 MXene quantum dots (MQD) via the hydrothermal stratification of Ti3C2 MXene materials etched by HF,148 and designed a 3D layered porous composite material NiFe-LDH/MQD/NG (Fig. 7c). The unique quantum dot structure and 3D porous structure enabled more edge active sites to be exposed in the MXene, and the synergistic effect with NiFe-LDH endowed the whole composite with enhanced OER catalytic activity. Jiang et al. used 2D Ti3C2 as a raw material and cut it into many 0D Ti3C2 QDs with a uniform dispersion and size of about 5 nm (Fig. 7d) via an Li embedding method (Fig. 7e).149 The results showed that for the Ti3C2 QDs, the catalytic activity of the edge transition metal sites (especially the transition metal linked to –OH functional group) was still higher than that of the base transition metal sites (Fig. 7f), and thus the change from 2D to 0D can expose an increasing amount of efficient active sites, greatly improving the catalytic performance of the material. The material was used for 1.0 M KOH alkaline electrocatalysis of the HER, and when the current density was 10 mA cm−2, the HER overpotential was 201 mV, the Tafel slope was 106 mV dec−1, and the potential decreased by 27 mV after 2000 cycles. Simultaneously, this method is universal, which can cut single-layer MXene nanoplates to obtain N2C QDs, and cut multi-layer MXene nanoplates to obtain Ti3C2 QDs, V2C QDs and Nb2C QDs. Pang et al. successfully synthesized 1D Nb2CTx MXene nanowires (NW, Fig. 7g) with a length of 3 μm by electrochemical etching in dilute hydrochloric acid electrolyte assisted with ultrasonic treatment,150 which also enabled MXene to expose more edge active sites. Co3+@3D CFC/Nb2CTx NW composites were designed to effectively alleviate the problem of the restacking of NW due to the capillary effect. This composite was used for electrocatalytic HER, and it was found that the reaction followed the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism. Under the acidic condition of 0.5 M H2SO4, when the current density was 10 mA cm−2, the HER overpotential was 236 mV, and the Tafel slope was 123 mV dec−1, which could achieve a good electrocatalytic performance for the OER (Fig. 7h).
In addition to the edge sites of MXenes, transition metal disulfides (TMDs, such as MoS2) also have edge sites. Simultaneously, their high activity, low cost, low ΔGH* and other characteristics make them some of the most studied HER catalysts, but their active sites are not exposed and their conductivity is not high. The vertical growth151 on MXenes can not only expose more active edge sites of TMD, but also improve the conductivity of TMD. Therefore, Li et al. selected a 1T′ octahedron coordination phase with higher conductivity in MoS2 and high catalytic activity on both the edge and substrate.113 The 1T′ phase was highly accounted for with ∼85.0% via the one-step hydrothermal method, and the edge orientation grew along the (002) crystal plane and was completely encapsulated (several layers of thickness) on Ti3C2Tx to form the MoS2–Ti3C2 MXene material, as shown in Fig. 7i. The pretreatment of organic matter such as cationic polymers not only prevented the oxidation of MXene, but also increased the layer spacing (more than 1.5 times), which was beneficial for the transportation and charge transfer in the material. The surface charge of the MXene is also changed, and thus MoS42− could be well adsorbed on its surface and anchored to form an MoS2 shielding layer, which further avoided the oxidation of the MXene. Simultaneously, the two materials formed heterogeneous structures and produced synergistic effects, which further improved their HER electrocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the chemical bond formed between the MXene and MoS2 enhanced the structural stability of the composites, enabling rapid charge transfer. It was found that no TiO2 peak was detected in the XRD pattern of the MoS2–Ti3C2 MXene material (Fig. 7j), which verified that the shielding layer and organic matter were beneficial to improve the oxidation resistance of the MXene. Under the acidic condition of 0.5 M H2SO4, when the current density was 10 mA cm−2, the HER overpotential was 98 mV (Fig. 7k and l), the Tafel slope was 45 mV dec−1 (Fig. 8a), the TOF at 150 mV and 200 mV was 1.28 s−1 and 2.60 s−1, respectively (Fig. 8b), and the CdI was 26.0 mF cm−2 (Fig. 8c). After 20 h chronoamperometry (i–t) test, the initial current loss was 3.5% (Fig. 8d).113

In summary, the electrocatalytic performance of MXenes can be improved by the reasonable regulation of intrinsic defects. There are two internal defects, where firstly the atomic vacancy defects mainly generate electroactive sites by adjusting the electronic structure, and accordingly their concentration and distribution will affect the catalytic performance of MXenes. Among them, the ordered double-vacancy performance is relatively excellent (without affecting the stability). However, it is necessary to reasonably control the atomic vacancy defects in the appropriate range, otherwise they will cause an attenuation in the electrocatalytic performance. Secondly, the active edge defects expose more active sites, and the active boundary or active region can be increased by reducing the dimension or forming a porous structure. The study of vacancy defects is mostly focused on metal cation vacancies, whereas the study of anion vacancies is rare. The internal defects of MXenes are very complex, and most of them are the coexistence of atomic vacancy defects and active edge defects. At present, there are few studies on internal defects, especially in terms of catalytic mechanism. Therefore, it is urgent to explore the relationship between internal defects and catalytic mechanism.125

3.3 MXene-based catalysts with suitable 3D or porous structure
van der Waals force exist between the layers of MXenes, which have the tendency to re-accumulate, which will lead to the collapse of their unique layer structure and the formation of aggregates. This not only affects the physical and chemical properties of MXenes, but also affects their machinability, and thus their active surface cannot be fully exposed,152 which limits the application of MXenes in electrolytic water splitting to a certain extent. In this case, intercalation or freeze-drying can alleviate the problem of the reaggregation of MXenes, but the intercalation material may affect the performance of MXenes, and freeze-drying may also cause structural rearrangement of MXenes during the electrode fabrication process. The construction of MXenes with a 3D structure not only can resist aggregation, but also increase the specific surface area of MXenes.153 A three-dimensional conductive network can also improve the conductivity, and sometimes form a porous structure, which reduces the ion/mass transport distance, while increasing the porosity,154 promoting the electrochemical kinetics of the electrolytic water process, and obviously improving the machinability and robustness of MXene catalysts. Simultaneously, it has little effect on the inherent performance of MXenes. At present, the main methods for constructing 3D MXenes include solution-based self-assembly,152,155 gelation,156,157 template method,158–160 3D printing,161,162 electrospinning163 and gas foaming technology.164 Xiu et al. developed a capillary force assembly method for the preparation of 3D MXenes (Fig. 8e).103 Firstly, ultrasonic wave atomized the colloid MXene, and then the inward capillary force during drying drove aerosol MXene isotropic compression and formed a spherical 3D MXene structure (Fig. 8f and g). It was found that the structure of the 3D MXene was not affected by the pressure of 150 MPa, which was not realized by the original MXene, and the anti-aggregation ability of the material greatly improved. Simultaneously, the average size of the 3D MXene could be changed by changing the concentration of colloidal solution (Fig. 8h). Although the –OH content and conductivity of 3D MXene were lower than that of the original MXene, they could still be directly used. In this study, Co3O4 was in situ transformed into CoP nanocrystal on 3D Ti3C2 to form the CoP@3D Ti3C2-MXene material (Fig. 9a). The counter electrode composed of CoP@3D Ti3C2-MXene and CP electrode were completely hydrolyzed under the alkaline condition, and continuous electrolysis for 150 h could be realized. When the current density was 10 mA cm−2, the HER overpotential was 128 mV, while that of the OER was 280 mV. Through the study of the separate OER semi-reaction, it was also found that the content of CoP, not the main electroactive catalyst, was not the higher, the better but had an optimal value. If the content of CoP was increased or decreased or pure CoP was directly used as the catalyst, the performance of the material declined. This phenomenon could be well explained by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The combination of 3D MXene and CoP led to a positive shift in the 2p peaks of Co and P, and a negative shift in the 2p peak of the 3D MXene due to the transfer of the charge density of 3D MXene and CoP, resulting in a synergistic effect, which strengthened the interfacial bonding and coupling of the material. The high conductivity and specific surface area of 3D MXenes guarantee effective charge transfer and reduce the charge transfer impedance (Rct = 4.3 Ω). The 3D framework also avoids the aggregation of CoP. Therefore, it is very important to improve the overall electrocatalytic performance of the MXene by fully contacting the whole catalyst with water and releasing the gas from the electrode surface in time during the whole hydrolysis process.103

Kong et al. designed a three-dimensional Ru/C–Ti3C2Tx/NF electrode for overall water splitting under alkaline conditions (Fig. 9b).33 When the current density was 10 mA cm−2, the HER overpotential was 37 mV, and the Tafel slope was 60 mV dec−1. The HER may follow the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism. The current density of the overall water splitting device to reach 10 mA cm−2 only needed a voltage of 1.53 V. Studies showed that the excellent HER performance is mainly due to the hydrophilicity of the MXene. This is caused by the rich –O and –OH functional groups on the surface of MXenes, which enables the electrode to obtain good wettability (Fig. 9c), promotes the adsorption and dissociation of H2O, and balances the adsorption/dissociation of H*. Simultaneously, employing a high-speed charge folding camera (CCD) and laser particle image velocimetry (PIV) system, NF, Ru/NF, c-Ti3C2Tx/NF and Ru/C–Ti3C2Tx/NF could be photographed and tested successively. It was observed that the bubble size decreased gradually, and the flow rate of the electrolyte near the electrode increased significantly (Fig. 9d). This is because the rough surface and wrinkled three-dimensional structure of the Ru/C–Ti3C2Tx/NF material endowed it with good hydrophobicity (contact angle of >150°). This indicates that the hydrogen and oxygen generated during the electrolysis process can leave the electrode surface in time to avoid their influence on charge transfer and electrolyte contact, ensure high conductivity and reduce electrochemical impedance (Fig. 9e). DFT calculations also further proved that Ti3C2Tx played an indispensable role in promoting the adsorption and dissociation of water in the composite electrode.32
Yu et al. designed a 3D NiFe-LDH/Ti3C2/NF electrode by combining LDHs and MXene (Fig. 10a).90 Similar to most other MXene-based electrodes, this electrode did not need binders, avoiding a decrease in the conductivity and inherent activity of the material due to insulating binders, which achieved a stable and long-term cycle life. The electrode could be used for high current density (500 mA cm−2) and 280 h durability of overall water splitting under 1.0 M KOH alkaline condition. The HER and OER overpotentials were 205 mV and 300 mV, respectively. Furthermore, the Tafel slopes were 70 mV dec−1 and 44 mV dec−1, respectively. The HER on NiFe-LDH/Ti3C2/NF may undergo the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism. The cell composed of HER and OER could be driven by 1.51 and 1.75 V cell voltages at 10 and 500 mA cm−2 current densities, respectively. The stable electrolysis of water could be achieved for 200 h at the current density of 100 mA cm−2 (Fig. 9f). Thus, NiFe-LDH/Ti3C2/NF is a potential MXene-based material for industrial high-current electrolysis. The electrode made good use of the characteristics of the MXene to solve the problems of low conductivity, easy aggregation, poor HER catalytic activity and low electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of LDH, and the excellent characteristics of the LDH electrocatalytic OER performance to solve the problem of poor OER catalytic activity of MXene. The interface coupling between MXene and LDH could well promote the d band center of Ni/Fe to move to a higher energy and further optimize the performance of the material and 3D hierarchical porous structure. The structure of the MXene/NF framework and mesoporous LDH network could ensure the full surface area of the whole material, expose more active sites, and ensure the rapid charge/material transmission at a high current density.90 Based on LDH/MXene/NF, Li et al. designed a 3D porous material, P–MoO3 FCL Ti3C2Tx/NF, with a “celosia” heterostructure (Fig. 10b and c).100 Under the condition of 1 M KOH, when the current density was 10 mA cm−2, the HER and OER overpotentials were 118 mV and 179 mV, and the Tafel slopes were 105 and 40.44 mV dec−1, respectively. After being fabricated into a fully hydrolyzed electrolytic cell, the current density of 10 mA cm−2 could be reached only by supplying 1.53 V voltage, and the Faraday efficiencies of hydrogen and oxygen were 95.58% and 96.30%, respectively (Fig. 10d), which could realize a stability test for 42 h. This is because MXene, as a matrix, could ensure that FeCo-LDH (FCL) and MoO3 did not aggregate, and its hydrophilicity and high conductivity could ensure the mechanical stability of the composite and the charge/substance can be fully transmitted. There is a unique “celosia” heterostructure between FeCo-LDH nanowires and P–MoO3, which greatly increased the active area. The charge transfer from P–MoO3 to FeCo-LDH led to strong interface coupling, which changed the electronic structure, resulting in an excellent OER performance. According to DFT theoretical calculation, it is known that the material has favorable water molecule adsorption capacity (ΔGH2O = −1.024 eV) and smaller ΔGH* (−0.143 eV). The HER and OER on P–MoO3 FCL Ti3C2Tx/NF may undergo the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism and AEM, respectively. The active intermediate *OOH is produced by the rate-determining step (RDS), which can reduce the adsorption free energy of the reaction intermediates such as *OOH (Fig. 10e). Meanwhile, the density of states (DOS) of P–MoO3 FCL Ti3C2Tx/NF can be further increased compared with FCL Ti3C2Tx/NF, thus improving its OER activity.100

To make full use of seawater resources, alleviate the shortage of fresh water and adapt to the hydrolysis in the whole pH range, Xiu et al. prepared a honeycomb-like 3D multi-layer hollow structure mh-3D MXene (Fig. 10f) by aerosol drying combined with template method.4 The mh-3D MXene possessed a high specific surface area (284.7 m2 g−1) and its XRD pattern shows a shift in the (002) peak to a low angle of 0.7° (Fig. 10g), which could prevent the aggregation of MXene nanosheets. Combined with Pt (1–2 nm), Pt@mh-3D MXene was designed to explore the optimal Pt content in the synthesis and electrocatalytic test (Fig. 10h), avoiding the insufficient catalytic activity caused by a too low Pt content or excessive growth caused by too high Pt content. The Pt@mh-3D MXene material was used to electrolyze water under the condition of 1.0 M KOH. At the current density of 10 mA cm−2, Pt@mh-3D MXene exhibited the HER overpotential of 27 mV (when Pt content was 2.4 wt%), its Tafel slope of 41 mV dec−1, and it could work stably for more than 350 h. Under the condition of 0.5 M H2SO4, when the current density was 10 mA cm−2, the optimal HER overpotential was 13 mV (when the Pt content was 2.4 wt%), the Tafel slope was 24.2 mV dec−1, which could work stably for more than 450 h, and the HER catalytic activity was enhanced by adjusting the pH value (Fig. 11a), reaching 250 h in natural seawater. Pt@mh-3D MXene undergoes a fast Volmer–Tafel mechanism under pH < 2.1 and the slower Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism in the pH range of 4.2–14. This is because the combination of the two materials reduced the dissociation barrier of water to 0.44 eV (Fig. 11b), and ΔGH* is −0.12 eV. The size of the nanosheets composed of mh-3D MXene is short, which could effectively reduce the diffusion length, and thus the water molecules adsorbed on the hydrophilic MXene could easily diffuse to the Pt active site. Moreover, mh-3D MXene has a large number of macroporous and mesoporous channels, and its pore volume was up to 1.202 cm3 g−1, ensuring mass/charge transport.4

3.4 MXene-based composite catalysts
The number of active sites on the surface of pure MXenes is limited, and thus their electrocatalytic activity is generally not high. In this case, composite materials are important to realize the functionalization of MXenes and improve their catalytic efficiency. Among them, the combination with layered double hydroxides (LDHs), transition metal hydroxides, transition metal sulfides, transition metal phosphates and other water splitting catalysts with high-performance are expected to replace noble metals is the most widely studied at present.54 In most of composite processes, MXenes are often used as a matrix, carrier or co-catalyst. Different from the hydrophobicity or electrochemical inertness of carbon-based materials, MXenes are hydrophilic and exhibit certain catalytic activity. They not only can avoid the reduction and instability of the catalyst active sites caused by the agglomeration of high-performance catalysts, solve the inherent shortcomings of poor conductivity of some electrocatalysts and realize the rapid transfer of charges, but also use different synthesis methods to load other catalysts or directly grow on MXene in situ, and realize the oriented growth of catalysts to expose as many active sites as possible, thus maximizing the catalytic efficiency.

3.4.1 LDH/MXene composites. 
LDHs are potential OER catalysts. Loading them on a conductive substrate is an effective means to improve their low conductivity, expose more active sites and improve the electrocatalytic activity. At present, the main developed substrates are carbon-based nanomaterials, such as reduced graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). However, the non-polar carbon surface cannot achieve firm anchoring of the metal precursor of LDHs, and thus it cannot effectively adjust the electronic structure of LDHs and achieve the best interface coupling.48 MXenes possess a transition metal, metal conductivity, and can well achieve the anchoring of LDHs, while their surface contains a large number of functional groups, showing electronegative and hydrophilic characteristics, making them a good choice as LDH carriers. Deng et al. designed a P–CoFe-LDH@MXene/NF composite (Fig. 11c and d) to solve the problems of poor conductivity,165 limited electrochemical active surface area and slow hydrolysis process of transition metal layered double hydroxides. Under alkaline conditions (10 mA cm−2), only a low voltage of 1.52 V is needed to drive complete hydrolysis (Fig. 11e), and 100 h continuous operation could be achieved (Fig. 11f). When the current density was 10 mA cm−2, the HER overpotential was 65 mV, with the Tafel slope of 98.59 mV dec−1, CdI of 12.63 mF cm−2, and Tafel slope for the OER of 53.19 mV dec−1. The excellent properties of the composites originate from the reasonable design of Schottky heterostructure at the interface of the MXene and LDH. The interface is a relatively stable interface. The two materials can be well adapted to realize the stability of LDH, expose more edges, and enhance the overall metal abundance. In the whole hydrolysis process, the electron flow can be spontaneously driven through the interface, and the charge transport path is shortened. The basic mechanism is that the different band structures of the two materials will produce strong interaction (Co 2p and Fe 2p in XPS are positively shifted, Fig. 11g and h, respectively), and the band bending will occur at the composite interface, resulting in the redistribution of charge (electron transfer from MXene to CoFe-LDH, Fig. 12a), that is, the formation of a Schottky heterostructure, and the activation/adsorption capacity of the active material on the interface with this structure is improved to varying degrees. Simultaneously, because the transition metal has unpaired d electrons, and P is a relatively strong electron donor, when doped with P, the d band center moves up, resulting in stronger bonds, and the surface electron density is effectively improved, resulting in surface defects and a large number of vacancies, improving the adsorption energy of the material, optimizing the adsorption of H2O molecules and intermediates, reducing the energy of redox reaction, and further improving the catalytic performance of the material. Through first-principles analysis, it was found that the DOS intensity of the MXene composited with CoFe-LDH improved (Fig. 12b). Moreover, because the conductivity is closely related to the DOS intensity of the Fermi level, the stronger the DOS, the more favorable the electron transfer,167 indicating that the interface effect of the two materials can further improve the conductivity of MXenes.165

Hu et al. also loaded CoNi-LDH on MXene.48 Through the alkaline electrocatalytic performance test of the OER, when the current density was 100 mA cm−2, the OER overpotential was 257.4 mV and the Tafel slope was 68 mV dec−1. The OER on CoNi-LDH/Ti3C2Tx may undergo the AEM. Through first-principles calculations, it was found that electrons can be transferred from Co and Ni to Ti3C2O2, and thus the LDH and Ti3C2O2 produce electronic synergy, and the DOS is enhanced near the Fermi level (Fig. 12c). Simultaneously, the d-band center of the Co and Ni atoms in CoNi-LDH loaded on Ti3C2O2 shifted negatively to a single CoNi-LDH (Fig. 12d), which reduced the bonding strength between the reaction intermediates (*OH, *O and *OOH) and the composites in the catalytic process, and made it easier to desorb from surface to promote the further reaction.48 Yan et al. in situ grew Ru-modified rose-like Co–N nanoflowers (Fig. 12e) on Ti3C2Tx by the method of LDH nitridation (Fig. 12f).65 Under the condition of 1.0 M KOH, for the HER and OER, the η10 values were 48.8 and 238 mV, the Tafel slopes of 44.1 and 68 mV dec−1, and the CdI values were 33.5 and 15.2 mF cm−2, respectively. HER follows the Volmer–Tafel mechanism (Fig. 12g) and the OER follows the AEM (eqn (8)–(9)16 and eqn (11)–(12)16, Fig. 12h). The current density of 10 mA cm−2 in the electrolysis device only needs a voltage of 1.52 V (Fig. 13a). The stable operation of 60 h could be achieved (Fig. 13b). This is due to the formation of covalent bonds between Ru–CoN and Ti3C2T, resulting in strong coordination, which promotes the structural stability and makes the Co center have more positive charges, which is conducive to the adsorption of OH−. The unique rose structure is conducive to exposing more active sites and the diffusion and transfer of mass/charge.

3.4.2 Transition metal (oxide) hydroxide/MXene composites. 
In addition to LDHs, transition metal (oxide) hydroxides are also a type of cost-effective OER catalyst, but it is difficult to overcome their poor stability and their activity is difficult to achieve practical application. Accordingly, their heterogeneous combination with MXenes can well solve this problem. Yan et al. designed the VOOH/Ti3C2Tx material (Fig. 13c and d).168 The overall water splitting experiment was carried out in 1.0 M KOH (Fig. 13e). When the current density reached 10 mA cm−2, only a voltage of 1.579 V (Fig. 13f) was required to achieve stable gas production for 50 h (Fig. 13g). The HER and OER overpotentials were 100 mV and 238 mV, and the Tafel slopes was 81.8 mV dec−1 and 81.6 mV dec−1, respectively. This is because the combination of MXene and VOOH not only avoided the aggregation of VOOH and improved the electrical conductivity, but also produced a strong synergistic effect. It could well change the electronic structure of the surface of Ti3C2Tx and VOOH and promote the adsorption and desorption of H* or oxygen-containing intermediates. The large specific surface area of MXenes, the vertical arrangement of VOOH and the lattice defects increased the number of active sites, which was conducive to mass transfer and charge transfer, and improved the intrinsic catalytic activity of the material.
Liu et al. studied a Mo-based MXene and used the characteristics of MXene with negative charge to assemble CO2+ with positive charge on Mo2CTxvia the hydrothermal method.167 Then, Co(OH)F, which was vertically grown on the surface of Mo2CTx, was phosphorylated by calcination. CoP nanoarrays were loaded on the surface of Mo2CTx (Fig. 13h) to generate CoP/Mo2CTx. Experiments showed that CoP could be densely arranged on Mo2CTx (Fig. 13i) and Co and P elements could be evenly distributed on the surface of Mo2CTx (Fig. 14a), indicating that the two materials could be fully combined. Under alkaline condition, when the current density was 10 mA cm−2, the overall water decomposition voltage was only 1.56 V, and 89% of the initial current could still be retained after 50 h (Fig. 14b). The HER overpotential was 78 mV and the Tafel slope was 66 mV dec−1. The HER reaction follows the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism, the CdI was 12.63 mF cm−2, the OER overpotential was 260 mV and the Tafel slope was 51 mV dec−1. The excellent catalytic performance is attributed to the porous structure of the composite. Mesoporous and macropores also exist, which greatly increased the specific surface area of the material and are conducive to the transport of materials. Through DFT study, it was found that the adsorption water dissociation energy barrier of CoP/Mo2CTx was 1.06 eV, which is much larger than that of Mo2CTx (Fig. 14c and d). Simultaneously, CoP on MXene caused a negative shift in its d-band center (Fig. 14e), resulting in an increase in the filling of anti-bond electrons, reducing ΔGH* to −0.037 eV (Fig. 14f), which is close to 0, indicating that the combination of MXene and CoP can well promote the dissociation of water and optimize the adsorption of H*. During the OER catalytic process, CoP converts into Co–OOH (Fig. 14g).167 Interestingly, Li et al. disproved the belief that metal oxides or metal hydroxides cannot be employed in the HER by combining an MXene with an ultra-thin transition metal hydroxide (TMH) network and designing the Co(OH)2@Ti3C2Tx composite material, which was used in the HER.166 This composite electrocatalyst showed excellent HER catalytic activity, which has opened up a new path for electrocatalytic HER research using metal oxides or metal hydroxides. When the current density was 10 mA cm−2, the HER overpotential was 21 mV, the Tafel slope was 31.7 mV dec−1, and the CdI was 43.34 mF cm−2. This is because of the heterogeneous interface coupling between the TMH and MXene, which resulted in a high concentration of oxygen vacancies in Co(OH)2@Ti3C2Tx (Fig. 11i). Electrons were transferred from Co to MXene, which will change the electronic structures of TMH and MXene. The density of states of Co(OH)2@Ti3C2Tx near the Fermi level and the redox activity of the Co center were enhanced, and this change may improve the adsorption of H2O and H atoms in Co(OH)2, which has a poor HER catalytic performance. The researchers also extended their studies to overall water splitting, using Co(OH)2@Ti3C2Tx as the cathode and FeNi-LDH as the anode, and they found that water electrolysis in an alkaline environment of 1.0 M KOH could reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 only by supplying a voltage of 1.46 V and it could work stably at this current density for 100 h.166

3.4.3 Single-atom/MXene composites. 
Single-atom catalysts (SACs) are potential heterogeneous catalysts with atomic dispersion and relatively independent catalytic active sites and particular selectivity, unsaturated coordination, and quantum confinement effect, which can realize a small amount of high-efficiency catalytic activity and interact with a suitable carrier. The mono-atom-carrier catalyst can avoid the aggregation of single atoms due to its high surface energy. At present, most carriers are carbon materials such as graphene or carbon nanotubes (CNTs), but their hydrophobicity is the most important obstacle in the process of water electrolysis. Alternatively, MXene has excellent hydrophilicity and conductivity and is a good monatomic carrier. Thus, the combination of the above-mentioned two advantages can greatly improve the catalytic activity of MXene materials.
Gu et al. predicted by DFT theory that Ti2CO1.33F0.67 with mixed functional groups of –F and –O exhibit an excellent HER performance, ΔGH ≈ 0.1 eV (ref. 170) (Fig. 15a). Through monatomic hybridization based on Ti2CTx (T = O, F), 200 types of transition metals were selected, and it was found that single atoms of Ti, Rh, Ir and Pt transition metals could reduce the activation barrier of hydrogen generation, and their combination with MXenes resulted in the formation of potential HER candidate materials.170 Fu et al. studied the effects of 12 transition metal single-atom (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Os, Ir, Pt, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag and Au) on the electrocatalytic HER and OER performance of Ti3C2O2 by DFT calculations.171 The results showed that the adsorption of transition metal single atoms (TMSA) on Ti3C2O2 is thermodynamically favorable, and there were two main adsorption sites, which were located above the Ti atoms and above the C atoms in MXene, respectively (Fig. 15b). After the introduction of TM atoms, they could provide electrons for the oxygen atoms on the surface of MXene (Fig. 15c) and increase the number of electrons (Ne) and p-state filling, resulting in an increase in the σ* occupancy of the H–O bond and stronger binding between H and MXene. Therefore, these 12 types of TM atoms will increase or maintain the HER catalytic activity of MXenes to different degrees (Fig. 15d), while greatly improving their OER catalytic activity. Through comparison and screening, it was found that Pd1@Ti3C2O2 is a potential total hydrolysis catalyst, with the HER and OER overpotentials of 0.22 V and 0.31 V, respectively, while Co1@Ti3C2O2 is not favorable for overall water splitting because oxygen is difficult to desorb from it.171

Ramalingam et al. obtained RuSA–N–S–Ti3C2Tx by freeze-drying foaming and annealing doping.172 Due to the charge transfer between the transition metal (M) on the surface of the MXene and the functional groups, the functional groups on the surface had a lot of negative charges, making the surface of the MXene negatively charged.173 Ru3+ can be attached to the surface of MXene by the electrostatic adsorption, which is beneficial for the dispersion of Ru single atoms (RuSA) (Fig. 15e). Simultaneously, due to the strong coordination interaction between Ru and N/S heteroatom dopants, the formation of Ru–N and Ru–S bonds can be realized. Thus, RuSA can be firmly fixed on the surface of the MXene carrier. The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) also showed that the existence of N and S makes RuSA and Ti3C2Tx have strong electronic coupling. Under the acidic condition of 0.5 M H2SO4, when the current density was 10 mA cm−2, the HER overpotential was 76 mV (Fig. 15f) and the Tafel slope was 90 mV dec−1 (Fig. 15g), which was much lower than that of RuSA–Ti3C2Tx (215 mV). Alternatively, under alkaline and neutral conditions, when the current density was 10 mA cm−2, it was found that the reaction follows the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism, and the electrochemical activity mainly comes from the matrix MXene and doped N/S and RuSA single-atom. In addition, because of the thiourea-assisted carbonization process in the annealing process, the oxidation on the surface of MXene was greatly inhibited, and the stability of the whole catalyst improved. The CdI was 31 mF cm−2 (Fig. 15h) and the TOF value was 0.52 s−1 (100 mV), 0.87 s−1 (150 mV) and 1.5 s−1 (200 mV) (Fig. 16a). DFT calculation showed that the charge transfer between RuSA and Ti3C2Tx carrier and the coordination between N/S and Ti3C2Tx changed the surface state density of the MXene, producing a low non-bond strength near Fermi level. The Gibbs free energy of the intermediate H* (ΔGH*) is 0.08 eV, which is close to the ideal value of 0 eV and beneficial for the adsorption and desorption of intermediate H* and improved the catalytic performance of the HER. In addition, they also prepared other metals (Fe, Ni, Co, and Pt) to compare with RuSA and found that RuSA had the highest HER catalytic activity (Fig. 16b).172

3.4.4 Other MXene-based composite catalysts. 
The presence of noble metal nanoparticles can effectively promote the reduction of the transition metal M in MXenes and remove their surface functional groups. This is mainly due to the RMSI chemical reaction between the metal and MXene carrier, resulting in a thermally stable bimetallic structure, which may form intermetallic compounds (IMCs)175 and reduce the reaction temperature. Studies have shown that the Pt/Ti3C2Tx and Pt/Nb2CTx catalysts obtained by the wet impregnation method (IWI) have superlattice signals, indicating that the combination of the two catalysts does not result in the formation of disordered alloys, but the formation of ordered Pt3Ti IMC and Pt3Nb IMC intermetallic phases extending from the edge, and the crystal forms are Cu3Au (Fig. 14h and i). The active site for the electrocatalytic process is the strong metal bond in IMCs. The DFT analysis showed that compared with pure Pt, the d-band center of Pt in Pt3Ti IMC and Pt3Nb IMC moved down to different degrees, which reduced the active energy barrier of the surface adsorption reaction and enhanced the DOS strength.169 Li et al. used in situ-formed Pt3Ti IMC on Ti3C2Tx to catalyze the HER.78 Through in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS, Fig. 16c and d), it was not difficult to find that the degree of transition from single atom to intermetallic compound is closely related to the annealing temperature. Excessive temperature led to the aggregation of IMC and the oxidation of MXene, and too low temperature caused the reduction of Ti on the surface of MXene. It was found that the best HER catalytic performance was obtained at 550 °C. Under the acid condition of 0.1 M HClO4, when the current density was 10 mA cm−2, the HER overpotential was 32.37 mV (Fig. 16e) and the Tafel slope was 32.3 mV dec−1 (Fig. 16f). After 2000 cycles, the HER overpotential only increased by 2.5 mV. DFT calculation showed that Pt3Ti IMC has good thermodynamic stability and its formation energy is −0.88 eV. The adsorption strength of H* on the (111) and (100) crystal planes is appropriate, and ΔGH* is −0.01 and −0.05 eV, respectively.78
Quantum dots are a type of inorganic nanomaterials with high specific surface area and abundant active sites. The combination of MXenes and quantum dots not only can avoid the decrease in conductivity caused by the self-stacking of the MXene interlayers, but also limit the aggregation of quantum dots to improve the catalytic activity of the materials. The traditional method for loading quantum dots on a substrate is generally the hydrothermal method, but MXenes are easily oxidized by the oxygen in aqueous solution due to their poor oxygen resistance in the reaction process. Pang et al. realized the growth of sub-nanometer (1.15 nm) Pt quantum dots on one-dimensional Nb2CTx nanowires at a low temperature (150 °C) and without a reducing atmosphere174 (Fig. 16g), which overcomes the high annealing temperature limit of the reactive metal–support interaction (RMSI) and provides another possibility for the moderate growth of noble metals. Pt QDs@Nb2CTx NW has pH universality and exhibits excellent electrocatalytic HER performance in both acidic and alkaline conditions. When the current density reached 10 mA cm−2, the overpotentials were 33.3 mV and 65.1 mV, respectively. This is attributed to the fact that one-dimensional Nb2CTx material has a work function similar to Pt,176 which can expose more active sites than 2D MXene materials, and there is a strong covalent interaction between the quantum dots and the carrier. Zhu et al. studied a self-assembly method using van der Waals force to load QDs on Ti3C2Tx in tetrahydrofuran (THF) under non-hydrothermal conditions, and successfully synthesized BP QDs/Ti3C2Tx-MXene composites (Fig. 16h).108 When the current density reached 10 mA cm−2, the voltage of 1.78 V was needed for the overall water splitting experiment under alkaline conditions. The Tafel slopes for the HER and OER were 64.3 mV dec−1 and 83.0 mV dec−1, respectively, which were better than that of the two individual materials. This was because the ΔGH* value (−1.01 eV) of Ti3C2Tx was too negative, and the adsorption of intermediate H* on its surface was too strong, while the ΔGH* value (0.81 eV) of the BP QDs was too positive, and the adsorption of intermediate H* on them was very weak. Thus, the combination of the two materials could make their respective adsorption sites ΔGH* value close to 0 (Fig. 16i).
At present, the research on MXenes is mainly focused on Mo-based or Ti-based carbides, but there are also some exploration and theoretical studies based on other transition metal carbides or nitrides, laying the foundation for finding the best MXene for overall water splitting in the future. Cheng et al. predicted the observability of Cr-based MXene combined with Ni2P for electrolytic water by DFT calculation.177 It was found that the interfacial bonding of the Ni2P/Cr2CO2 composite (Fig. 17a) was relatively stable, and the interfacial bonding energy was −2.432 J m−2. When the current density reached 10 mA cm−2, the theoretical HER and OER overpotentials were 90 mV and 0.8 V, respectively. The HER followed the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism with the activation barrier (Ea) of 0.68 eV and ΔGH* of −0.09 eV. The OER reaction is divided into four steps, as shown in Fig. 17b. The formation of the intermediate product OOH * is the rate-controlling step. In the electrocatalytic process, the electrons in the Ni atom will transfer to the MXene terminal –O, which improves the bond cooperation between Ni and O, improves the strong combination of Ni and the reaction intermediate (OOH*), and leads to the transfer of the d-band center of Ni to the low energy direction (Fig. 17c), and thus the intermediate product can be more easily desorbed and the electrocatalytic performance of the material improved.177 Wang et al. designed VS2@V2C by vertically growing T–VS2 nanosheets on V2C.178 The composite material was used for electrocatalytic HER and seawater electrolysis at different pH values (0, 2, 4, 7, 8.6, 10, 12, and 13.8), and the HER followed the typical Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism. At a current density of 20 mA cm−2, the HER performance of the VS2@V2C catalyst exhibited the HER overpotential and Tafel slope of 164 mV and 47.6 mV dec−1 in 1.0 M KOH, 138 mV and 37.9 mV dec−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively. This is because V2C has higher conductivity than most MXenes and can provide electrons for VS2, which is conducive for the mass transfer process and charge transfer. The vertically grown structure inhibited the restacking of the V2C nanosheets due to the interlayer van der Waals force, avoiding the agglomeration of the composite material, which increased the specific surface area of the composite material and exposed more active sites. The combination of the above-mentioned two materials can effectively reduce the value of ΔGH*, thereby promoting the adsorption of H* and the desorption of water molecules. In addition, the VS2@V2C composite catalyst achieved more than 50 CV cycles in the natural seawater environment (pH = 8.6) and exhibited long-term stability over 200 h at an overpotential of 500 mV. This is because VS2 can effectively reduce the adsorption of Cl− in seawater, avoid chloride ions occupying the active sites to poison the composite catalyst, and improve the stability of the composite catalyst during the process of seawater electrolysis.178

4. Challenges in the application of MXene-based catalysts for water splitting
4.1 The challenges of MXene oxidation stability for water splitting
The oxidation of MXenes prepared in aqueous solution under environmental conditions has always been one of the obstacles in employing MXene-based materials in various applications. The oxidation of MXenes begins with vacancies or defects (edge defects and internal defects) of MXenes, and then transition metal oxide nanocrystals nucleate and expand, until the whole MXene material is oxidized and its structure is destroyed. Simultaneously, due to its larger specific surface area, single-layer MXene is easier to be oxidized.183,184 Taking the Ti3C2Tx MXene as an example, the equation involved in oxidation is shown in eqn (26),139 and the oxidation process is shown in Fig. 17d.179 In addition, the MXene oxidation rate is faster in water, and the MXene-based material with a damaged structure will not only exhibit decreased catalytic activity, but also easily peel off from the electrode, resulting in the instability of the electrode in the application of overall water splitting.117 Simultaneously, industrial-grade water electrolysis needs to be carried out at a high current density (500 mA cm−2),90 and MXene electrocatalysts will face more severe stability problems. Consequently, MXenes are prone to oxidation and degradation in water media, resulting in limited electrode stability, which is one of the major challenges of MXenes for overall water splitting application. Ti3C2O2 + 4O2 → 3TiO2 + 2CO2(26)
At present, the main solution is to cover the surface of MXenes with other materials to prevent their oxidation and ensure their good stability in the process of water electrolysis. For example, Lim et al. used in situ vulcanization to grow Mo2CTx with 2H phase Mo2S,29 forming and Mo2CTx/2H-MoS2 composite (Fig. 17e). This material exhibited excellent HER catalytic activity and good stability in acidic, alkaline and neutral electrolyte environments, and could achieve 100000 cyclic voltammetry continuous electrolysis (j = −10 mA cm−2geom). The reason for this is that 2H-MoS2 just grows on the surface of the insulating layer where Mo2CTx may grow, which may induce MoO3−x to be converted into 2H-MoS2in situ, effectively preventing the oxidation of Mo. Meanwhile, the in situ epitaxial growth method makes the interface coupling between the two materials strong, and the d-band of Mo and the p-band of the O and S atoms in the interface are closely combined after cracking, effectively preventing the dislocation of MoS2 in the later use process. In addition, the addition of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) during the preparation of few-layer MXenes by high-energy mechanical milling method (HEMM) can effectively prevent their oxidation.185 Introducing hydrophobic coatings such as ihydrazine186 and trimethoxy (1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyl) silane187 to avoid direct contact between water molecules and MXenes, changing the functional groups by hydrogen annealing, reducing the amount of M–H2O,188 or preparing high-quality MXenes with few defects and large specific surface area189 can improve the environmental stability of MXenes.190 However, although some studies have used these methods to delay the oxidation of MXenes, their effect is limited. Simultaneously, most studies on overall water splitting have not considered the oxidation of MXenes unfortunately. Therefore, to realize the commercial application of MXenes in overall water splitting, more studies need to pay attention to the oxidation of MXenes, analyze the micro-oxidation process of MXenes in the overall water splitting process, improve the stability of MXene materials under various reaction conditions, and develop more MXene-based composites with oxidation resistance, high stability and excellent catalytic activity.
4.2 The challenges of MXene long-term stable storage
To ensure the commercial application of MXenes as catalysts for overall water splitting in the future, the long-term stable storage of MXenes is an urgent problem to be solved. However, the MXene materials obtained using aqueous etching agents such as HF are not suitable for storage, and their oxidation may occur in a water environment within only 1–2 weeks. Simultaneously, it was found that the higher the ambient humidity, the lower the conductivity of the material and the faster the oxidation of Ti3C2Tx thin films by ultraviolet light (Fig. 17f),180 which is due to the conversion of ultraviolet light into heat energy and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as OH free radicals.191 At present, some methods for storing MXenes have been proposed. The organic salt or inorganic salt anions are covered on the edge of MXenes to produce an ion shielding effect or hydration reaction with water molecules (Fig. 17g)181 to delay the oxidation of MXenes, such as polyphosphates, polysilicates, polyborates (Fig. 17h)182 and sodium L-ascorbate (NaAsc) solution (Fig. 18a and b).192 Deep educational solutions (DESs) are used to form hydrogen bonds with functional groups on the surface of MXenes to passivate their surface (Fig. 18c).193 MXene powder formed by freeze-drying or storing in ultra-low temperature environment, such as Ti3C2Tx MXene frozen at −20 °C to delay its oxidation kinetics,194 which could achieve stable storage for up to 650 days (Fig. 18d–f), while the morphology and properties of the MXene material did not change obviously.

However, these methods have their own problems and cannot be used for practical large-scale storage. For example, ultra-low temperature storage has the problem of high cost. Freeze-drying takes a long time. The dried MXene powder used in electrocatalytic applications needs to be converted into a colloidal solution again, but the dispersion is not as good as before. Antioxidants such as inorganic salts and organic solvents require post-treatment removal and waste liquid recovery. Therefore, it is also a challenge for the commercial application of overall water splitting to explore low-cost, green and easy to industrialize long-term storage routes for MXenes.
4.3 The challenges of the application of nitride MXenes for water splitting
At present, it is theoretically predicted that there will be at least 17 types of thermodynamically stable nitride MXenes (Fig. 18g). However, due to the high formation energy of the parent MAX, the difficulty in synthesis and the fact that some MAX phases are still in the theoretical stage, and the M–N bond is stronger than the M–C bond, the energy required to form an M–N bond is higher, and the stability of the formed M–N layer is relatively poor, which makes etching difficult.109 Thus, only four types of nitride MXenes have been verified by experiments at present.196–198 Furthermore, the current methods for the preparation of nitride MXenes have the problems of low yield, complex post-processing and lack of suitable stratification methods to obtain stable single-layer/few-layer nitride MXenes. Compared with carbide MXenes, the research on the application of nitride MXenes is limited, and only a few studies involve the application of MXenes for water splitting. However, through DFT calculations, it was predicted that compared with carbide MXenes, nitride MXenes may have a larger active surface area, higher conductivity,196 better metal characteristics and excellent wide hydrogen adsorption window activity. Simultaneously, compared with carbon atoms, nitrogen atoms provide one more electron, showing a stronger M–X bond and better mechanical stability,199 and thus nitride MXenes may have higher catalytic activity for water splitting. In addition, some studies have shown that unlike C-based MXenes, the HER catalytic activity of Ti4N3Tx mainly comes from its basal sites rather than the edge sites. In the case of M–Ti4N3Tx, its catalytic mechanism for the HER is different from the conventional continuous Volmer and Heyrovsky steps, which may be very complicated.46 Unfortunately, due to the lack of further exploration of catalytic mechanism, the specific mechanism has not been further obtained, and the specific effects of the structure and electronic properties of transition metals on the HER are still unknown. Therefore, it is still a challenge to apply nitrides in water splitting, which requires the design of cost-effective and efficient methods for the preparation of nitride MXenes, development of more types of nitride MXene materials and further research based on nitride MXenes for hydrogen production by water splitting, especially on the electrocatalytic mechanism of nitride MXenes.
4.4 The challenge of seawater splitting with MXene-based materials
To achieve industrial-scale water electrolysis, a large supply of high-purity water is required. If the scarce fresh water is used as the water supply to make hydrogen production from water electrolysis, the burden on drinking water is relatively large and the cost is high. Seawater accounts for 96.5% of the total water volume of the Earth, which is rich in resources and can be directly used for overall water splitting.200 It can produce hydrogen in a mild and environment-friendly way, while saving fresh water resources and not increasing carbon emissions. Thus, it has a profound effect on the development of hydrogen energy and the economy. However, due to the fact that the pH value of seawater is generally neutral or weakly alkaline, the HER and OER catalytic activities of most catalysts in this pH range are very low. Meanwhile, in the process of seawater splitting, insoluble precipitates are easily formed on the catalyst surface, covering the active sites and further reducing the catalytic activity, and there is a competitive reaction of chloride oxidation reaction (ClOR) at the anode, which will cause electrode corrosion. In addition, the current devices of seawater splitting will cause the accumulation and high concentration of NaCl due to the continuous supply of seawater, which will aggravate the competitive reaction and electrode corrosion.201 These are very big obstacles in applying MXene-based catalysts for seawater electrolysis. Although some studies have made some breakthroughs in the stability of seawater splitting and achieved a service life of 250 h in natural seawater,4 there are still only a few studies on MXene-based catalysts for seawater electrolysis. Therefore, when seawater is used as a water supply source for overall water splitting, it is necessary to optimize the seawater electrolysis device and develop MXene-based catalysts with high catalytic activity, low CIOR competitive reaction selectivity, wide pH application range, corrosion resistance and long-term stability in the seawater environment, which is also a challenge for water electrolysis.
5. Conclusions and prospects
MXene-based materials as electrocatalysts in overall water splitting can be used as both cathode and anode materials to undergo HER/OER reactions to produce hydrogen and oxygen, respectively. With the characteristics of renewable raw materials and green environmental protection, the overall water splitting by MXene-based materials is an effective way to solve the energy crisis and environmental pollution caused by fossil energy hydrogen production. If green renewable energy (such as solar energy and wind energy) is used as the power source of electricity for overall water splitting and some environment-friendly MXenes preparation methods, such as molten salt etching or electrochemical etching, be realized for the synthesis of MXene-based catalysts, they can be applied in overall water splitting without pollution and adverse effects on the environment under the premise of mature technology and cost-effectiveness. Simultaneously, the generated green hydrogen has high energy density and non-pollution emissions during combustion. It is also a clean energy that is expected to replace fossil fuels. When used in ammonia synthesis or fuel cells, it can greatly reduce the carbon emissions of the chemical industry and alleviate the greenhouse effect. It is believed that MXene-based catalysts for hydrogen production from overall water splitting can contribute to environmental protection.
The catalytic activity of MXenes is related to the number of active sites and the intrinsic activity of a single site. The electrocatalytic performance of MXenes can be enhanced by exposing more active sites, such as active edges and atomic vacancies, or by increasing the intrinsic activity of the active sites, such as adjusting the functional groups, compounding other materials and doping other elements. Herein, we reviewed the direct use of MXene materials as excellent electrocatalysts through doping, surface modification and defect regulation. MXenes can be used as a carrier for some granular catalysts to avoid their agglomeration and can cover the surfaces of some nanomaterials to prevent their oxidation or/and make up for their low conductivity, poor cycle stability and other defects. MXenes can also be combined with some positive materials by electrostatic force or electrodeposition, and the resulting composites will have the excellent properties of two or more materials. Simultaneously, the catalytic activity of the composite materials can be further improved by interfacial coupling and synergistic effect. The 3D or porous structure of MXene-based catalysts can avoid self-stacking and improve the conductivity and catalytic performance. In these studies, we can draw the following conclusions and prospects:
(1) In the current studies, MXenes were usually combined with MoS2 or monoatomic noble metal for the HER and LDH or MOF for the OER. To promote the OER under alkaline conditions, the modification of MXenes by doping can achieve local changes in their nanostructures, mainly focusing on the doping of transition metals and N, P and S nonmetals. The type and amount of surface functional groups can well adjust the conductivity and catalytic activity, and the functional group with better HER performance is –O. The reasonable atomic vacancy defects or edge defects can increase the catalytic activity or number of active sites, but most of them focus on HER research. The studies related to the OER and overall water splitting are relatively limited, lacking an effective catalytic mechanism and accurate control of inherent defects. 3D structures avoid the self-accumulation of MXenes and can combine with nickel foam electrode, which has made some breakthroughs in the HER under seawater conditions and full pH. MXenes mixed with other materials can produce interface coupling and synergistic effects, some of which will affect the strain of materials to achieve the optimization of properties and surface morphologies.66 The formation of intermetallic compounds between noble metal nanoparticles and MXenes is expected to improve the number of active sites and intrinsic activity simultaneously. However, there is no mechanism for the migration of transition metals in MXenes to noble metal nanoparticles.169
(2) The stability and electrical conductivity of nitride MXenes are higher than that of carbide MXenes in water. However, due to their difficulty preparation, there are few studies on the overall water splitting of nitrides. Most studies are focused on carbon-based MXenes represented by Ti3C2Tx. Nitride MXenes as catalysts may become a good choice for overall water splitting in seawater in the future.126 The use of seawater (neutral condition) for water electrolysis not only can solve the problem of easy corrosion of electrolyzers and pollution under strong alkaline or acidic conditions, but also does not require the expensive membranes or separators, which reduces the cost of water electrolysis and has the value of further research.2
(3) Presently, in the age of information technology, the reasonable utilization of computer tools for DFT theoretical simulation,202 high-throughput screening203 or ensemble learning68 will help us understand the synergistic effect between MXenes66 and other materials more deeply and establish an ideal model. The reaction path and catalytic activity sites can be predicted by thermodynamic analysis, and the reaction intermediates and their binding energy are calculated to reveal the origin of electrocatalytic reactivity,36 and predict/discover MXene-based catalytic materials with higher activity. Simultaneously, the establishment of DFT calculation models based on defect MXenes and the HER, OER and overall water splitting catalytic mechanisms on MXenes need to be further explored and systematized.
(4) Under the real reaction conditions, combined with in situ/operational characterization techniques (such as Raman spectroscopy,37 SPM, infrared spectroscopy, and XAFS), the structure, oxidation state, coordination environment, and electronic properties of MXene materials and the interactions between the active sites and MXene carriers can be monitored and obtained in real time, which is helpful to understand the changes in the catalysts during the whole reaction process, provide real-time feedback for the catalytic process, and better understand the reaction mechanism. It is worth noting that the operating conditions need to be reasonably controlled to minimize the influence of in situ technology on the MXene material itself. For example, the high-energy X-ray in XAS will cause the surface oxidation of the MXene.195 Simultaneously, when judging the action mechanism, in addition to the combination of theoretical calculations and experiments, the influence of the electrostatic potential and solvation should also be considered, especially the operation technologies based on on-site monitoring.60
(5) At present, the design of MXene-based electrocatalysts for overall water splitting is basically composition optimization, alloying, morphology control, structure regulation and electronic structure control of composite materials. However, there is little research on the optimization strategy based on the influence of the double layer/water interface on the surface performance of the catalyst, such as the transfer of ions through the interface, which will provide a new direction for performance optimization.
In summary, the current research is still based on several major MXene materials in the early stage of groups 3–6, such as Ti3C2Tx, and the research on the catalytic mechanism of MXenes is scarce. Therefore, it is an urgent problem to be solved in the future to expand the research types of MXenes, change the situation of limited nitride MXenes research, provide more theoretical catalytic mechanisms of MXene-based catalysts and form systems to provide guidance for the development of novel and efficient MXene-based catalysts. Also, the research on the combination of transition metal (oxide) hydroxides and MXenes for alkaline HER has achieved Pt-like electrocatalytic performance,166 broke through the limitation of traditional thinking that transition metal oxides have poor electrocatalytic performance under alkaline conditions, provided a new direction for the research of MXene-based catalysts, and also highlighted the importance of breaking the mindset and daring to think and do. It is believed that MXene-based materials with excellent performances will be utilized for water electrolysis driven by innovative thinking, creating the possibility of realizing low-cost, high-efficiency and high-stability water electrolysis for hydrogen production.
