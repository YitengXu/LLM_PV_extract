, Accepted 5th August 2022First published on 5th August 2022AbstractDespite years of development, the efficiencies of single molecular organic solar cells (SMOSCs) are still kept at low levels, mainly because of the lack of high-performance acceptor segments in this field. In this work, we report two molecular dyads, SW1 and SW2, by introducing an unfused non-fullerene acceptor as the acceptor segments and linear oligomers as the donor segments and linking by flexible alkyl chains. Excellent photovoltaic performance of SW1 is achieved, leading to a power conversion efficiency of 3.78%, which is a record high for non-fullerene acceptor-based SMOSCs reported in the literature thus far. Notably, both SW1 and SW2 SMOSCs exhibit promising long-term storage and photo stabilities, indicating great potential in practical application. The success of our strategy provides a new motif for designing highly efficient SMOSCs. It can be expected that the single-component materials especially in terms of molecular dyads have stepped into a new developing era.
Introduction
Solution-processing organic solar cells (OSCs)1 are appealing candidates for a future renewable and sustainable energy scenario, with the unique advantages of cost-effectiveness,2 flexibility,3,4 semi-transparency,5 and compatibility with various applications.6 Traditionally, OSCs use a physically mixed electron-rich donor (D) and electron-deficient acceptor (A) as a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) photoactive layer, which is regarded as the basic prototype of high-performance OSCs.1 Generally, the ideal BHJ thin film should involve two interpenetrating D/A domains and a large interfacial area for efficient photogenerated exciton dissociation and charge transport processes.7 However, it is very difficult to afford satisfactory morphology just depending on the natural properties of the D/A mixture. Therefore, a variety of fabrication conditions and methods, including the D/A weight ratio, ternary strategy, solvent, additives, thermal annealing, solvent vapor annealing, etc., have been explored for morphology control precisely.8 Even if the favorable morphology is achieved by fine-tune control, such delicate morphology can easily evolve induced by internal driving forces of D/A materials, because the kinetically frozen state of the active layer will gradually change into a thermodynamically stable one.9,10 As a straightforward and drastic strategy, the single component photoactive layer has been employed to address the inherent instability issues of binary BHJ architecture, in which D and A are covalently combined in one molecule by flexible insulation or rigid π-conjugated linkers.11–13 Apart from the remarkable stability of single component OSCs (SCOSCs), a considerably simplified film fabrication process is also a unique advantage for industrial application. More specially, in SCOSCs, the exciton generation and dissociation would occur at one sole molecular architecture, definitely erasing the issue regarding limitations of the short exciton diffusion length.11
To our knowledge, SCOSCs are generally classified into three main categories on the basis of the structural composition, which are double-cable conjugated polymers,13 block conjugated polymers14 and molecular dyads.10,15 We have been particularly interested in molecular dyads, also called small molecular OSCs (SMOSCs), due to their unequivocal structures and excellent reproducibility versus polydisperse polymers.16 When the first example was reported by Nierengarten et al. based upon a C60-oligophenylenevinylene hybrid, it just produced photo-currents of a few microamps.17 After twenty years of rapid development, SMOSCs have recorded significant progress. More recently, an ambipolar “T-shaped” oligothiophene-fullerene dyad described by Peter et al. reached an exciting efficiency of 5.34%.16 Although fullerene derivatives take the overwhelming majority and provide the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) in reported SMOSCs, the intrinsic shortcomings of fullerene acceptor segments would severely restrict the further improvement of SMOSCs. On the one hand, the fullerene acceptor segment shows poor absorption strength in the visible and near-infrared regions.18 Therefore, the donor segment takes primary responsibility for photo harvesting in the active layer, resulting in a low short-circuit current density (JSC). On the other hand, due to the unique three-dimensional spherical structure, the fullerene moiety would significantly hinder the ordered stacking of the dyad, resulting in low charge mobility and severe charge recombination.9,10 Apparently, a starting point would be to replace fullerene acceptor ones with excellent non-fullerene acceptors, due to their special merits, such as wide and strong absorption and high crystallinity. However, although systematic studies on design rules, structure–property relationships and physical dynamics have considerably promoted the cognition of non-fullerene acceptor materials in polymer solar cells, there are still only few SMOSCs based on non-fullerene acceptor groups.
General structural concepts on non-fullerene acceptor-based SMOSCs include: (stage I) D and A are directly linked leading to a fully π-conjugated small molecule.19,20 However, owing to the lack of driving force for exciton dissociation and a charge transport channel, these types of molecule, such as TDCV-TPA19 and Dyad 3 (ref. 20) (Fig. 1), only provide poor photovoltaic performances. (Stage II) p-Type oligothiophene D and perylene bisimide (PBI)-based non-fullerene acceptors are attached by flexible linkers, corresponding to an efficient molecular BHJ model.15,21 Despite the success of the PBI-based SMOSCs reported, for instance, S-SMDPP15 developed by Li et al., the lower absorption coefficient still restrains the JSC and efficiency improvement. Thus, it is urgent to explore a practical strategy to introduce A–D–A-type acceptors into SMOSCs, opening the door of stage III.
 Fig. 1  Examples of small molecules for non-fullerene SCOSCs reported: TDCV-TPA, Dyad 3, F5T8-hP, OPV-NDI, S-SMDPP, SW1, and SW2. The PCEs of non-fullerene SCOSCs based on these small molecules are also included. 
It has been reported that non-fullerene acceptors whose ends are capped with 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IC) are sensitive to basic and protonic environments;22 therefore, a few synthesis routes can be applied to construct SMOSCs employing A–D–A type acceptor segments installed with an IC end-group, especially for all-fused-ring core acceptors, because of their complex synthesis.23,24 So non-fused ring electron acceptors with more flexible and simpler synthesis steps become the promising candidate.25 And as the counterparts of fused-ring electron acceptors, non-fused ring electron acceptors also possess some key elements such as broad and strong absorption; appropriate and tunable frontier molecular energy levels; ordered molecular stacking, which is beneficial for charge transport.26 Therefore, non-fused ring electron acceptor-based OSCs have displayed an efficiency of over 15%.26,27 What is more, non-fused ring electron acceptors have better stability because of the reduction of intramolecular tension via breaking the fused backbone.28 Thus, we selected the non-fused ring electron acceptor Tz-IC2F29 as the acceptor segments and synthesized two molecular dyads, SW1 (ref. 26) and SW2.30 Notably, the two dyads exhibit wide complementary absorption spectra within 400–850 nm and superior molar absorptivity, which are prerequisites for high JSCs. Additionally, both of them display the nature of crystallinity, which is beneficial for forming ordered structures, resulting in efficient charge transport. Impressively, the SW1 device demonstrates a PCE of 3.78% with a high JSC of 9.12 mA cm−2, which are among the top values of SMOSCs reported thus far. Importantly, this work paves the way for the further design of excellent performance SCOSCs.
Results and discussion
In this work, the synthetic routes to the subunits and dyads are provided in Scheme S1–S5,† and detailed synthetic procedures are presented in the Experimental section in the ESI.† According to some relevant articles, non-fullerene acceptors are sensitive to base during the reaction, making it difficult to modify with some functional groups. Through trial and error, we provide a method through azide–alkyne cycloaddition to couple D and A segments together. To implement this strategy, p-type units were functionalized with terminal alkynyl groups, and the n-type unit was equipped with an azide group. Finally, D and A moieties were coupled together to obtain molecular dyads, SW1 and SW2. The structures of target dyads (Fig. 1) were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (Fig. S20, S21 and S23, S24, ESI†), and high-resolution mass spectrometry (Fig. S22 and S25, ESI†). Additionally, both dyads are well dissolved in common organic solvents such as toluene, chloroform, and o-dichlorobenzene, beneficial for solution-processed fabrication.
The ultraviolet–visible absorption spectra of the two dyads and their corresponding D and A segments in 10−6 M chloroform solution and as films are displayed in Fig. 2a and S1.† In dilute solution, the absorbance spectra of SW1 and SW2 show a superposition of D and A moiety absorption (Fig. S1†). In other words, the complete optoelectronic structures of D and A moieties are well reserved and absorb the light independently, and then their absorptions are superimposed together to form the final absorption of dyads. Consequently, both SW1 and SW2 solutions show impressively panchromatic absorption from 400 to 800 nm with extinction coefficients of 2.13 × 105 M−1 cm−1 (at 730 nm) and 2.03 × 105 M−1 cm−1 (at 730 nm), respectively. Compared to solutions, the enhanced peaks at around 500 nm and redshifted 0–0 peaks for both dyads indicate facile intermolecular π–π stacking and ordered structures in the film state, as shown in Fig. 2a. Furthermore, the absorption onsets of SW1 and SW2 films are at 856 nm and 858 nm, corresponding to optical energy gaps (Eoptgs) of 1.45 eV and 1.44 eV, respectively. Of note is that the Eoptgs of the two dyads is much smaller than those of representative non-fullerene SMOSCs, including TDCV-TPA19 (1.90 eV), Dyad 3 (ref. 20) (1.83 eV), F5T8P-C4 (ref. 31) (2.41 eV), and S-SMDPP15 (1.48 eV); the corresponding molecular structures are exhibited in Fig. 1. More importantly, both SW1 and SW2 display maximum absorption coefficients of 7.7 × 104 cm−1 (at 706 nm) and 5.8 × 104 cm−1 (at 773 nm), respectively, which are higher than those of TDCV-TPA (4.0 × 104 cm−1) and S-SMDPP (4.6 × 104 cm−1) (Fig. S2†), and the corresponding data are summarized in Table S1.† This analysis demonstrates that the Tz-IC2F-based SMOSCs should have great potential to absorb more light photos and obtain higher JSC.

DSC first heating thermograms of (c) Tz-IC2F, BDT-3T-R, Tz-IC2F:BDT-3T-R blends, and SW1, and (d) Tz-IC2F, 5T-R, Tz-IC2F:5T-R blends, and SW2. 
The frontier energy levels of the monomers and two dyads are estimated by cyclic voltammogram measurements, presented in Fig. S3.† The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels are calculated to be −5.23/−3.78 eV for SW1 and −5.30/−3.77 eV for SW2, respectively. The corresponding energy level diagrams are displayed in Fig. 2b, and the data are summarized in Table S2.† In particular, the LUMO energy levels of the two dyads are fairly close to that of Tz-IC2F, and their HOMO energy levels are similar to those of their respective donors.9 Interestingly, this phenomenon is consistent with the results of density functional theory simulations. In the electron configurations of the two dyads, the electron cloud distribution only resides on the donor segment for HOMO calculations and the acceptor segment for LUMO calculations, respectively, shown in Fig. S4.† Besides, the molecular geometries of SW1 and SW2 are quite different from each other (Fig. S4†). In the optimized SW1 conformation, the D and A segments are closely stacked together in the shape of a “cross” model, while in SW2, the D and A segments are separated with a “T-shaped” fashion. This difference in molecular geometry may have a significant impact on the properties of the two dyads.
Then, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements are utilized to analyze the crystalline character of these D and A monomers and the two molecular dyads (Fig. S5, ESI†). The DSC thermograms of pristine BDT-3T-R, 5T-R and Tz-IC2F films have clear and sharp endothermic peaks at 202.1 °C, 126.4 °C, and 281.6 °C, respectively, demonstrating that the D and A monomers tend to form highly ordered crystallites. To illuminate the crystalline behaviors of the two dyads, we have gathered the first heating run data of D and A monomers, D/A blends, and the two dyads together, as depicted in Fig. 2c and d. In the two D/A blends at a molar ratio of 1:1, the melting peaks of D and A monomers are maintained, indicating that D and A monomers do not much disturb each other much in terms of molecular crystallinity. While only a single transition peak at 201.61 °C is observed in the SW1 heating process, SW2 exhibits two melting peaks at 163.22 °C and 188.35 °C upon heating. This interesting phenomenon indicates that the D and A segments of SW1 favor the formation of mixed crystalline regions, while D and A moieties of SW2 tend to crystallize separately, easily inducing microphase separation.21,32 Additionally, in contrast to SW1, a cold crystallization (137.3 °C) is observed for SW2, indicating the existence of amorphous but aggregated domains in the SW2 film.
To illuminate the different origins of the phase transition behavior, we further investigate the miscibility between the donors BDT-3T-R and 5T-R, and the acceptor Tz-IC2F via the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (χ).33 Generally, the χ value is determined from experimentally measured contact angles (Fig. S6,† using two solvents, water and ethylene glycol). As summarized in Table S3,† the χ of 5T-R and Tz-IC2F is 1.28, much higher than those of BDT-3T-R and Tz-IC2F with a rather low χ of 0.13. This means that the D and A moieties of SW1 have more miscible and good compatibility than that of SW2, partially implying the severe phase separation in the SW2 film. This observation fits in well with the DSC data as well as the molecular conformations of the two dyads.
We then performed atomic force microscopy and grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) to further explore the molecular packing and crystallinity of these two dyads. In the pristine Tz-IC2F film, the root mean square (RMS) roughness is as large as 1.647 nm (Fig. S7a†), which may be induced by its own intrinsically high crystallinity, consistent with the result of DSC measurements. The SW1 film presents a smooth film with a small RMS roughness of 0.66 nm (Fig. S7b†), while SW2 exhibits a rougher surface (a RMS roughness of 0.92 nm) with a larger domain size (Fig. S7c†). To further characterize the structure details, GIWAXS measurements of Tz-IC2F (Fig. S8†), SW1 (Fig. 3a), and SW2 (Fig. 3b) have been carried out. As shown in Fig. S8,† the pristine Tz-IC2F film adopts a preferential face-on orientation showing prominent (010) diffraction peaks located at qz = 1.75 Å−1 in the out of plane (OOP) direction. Compared with the Tz-IC2F film, both the two dyads of SW1 and SW2 show a weaker intensity of (010) peaks (Fig. 3c), indicating that the crystalline properties of the Tz-IC2F segment are slightly perturbed by the donor segments, confirmed by the DSC data (Fig. 2c and d). A closer look at the two dyad films reveals that SW1 exhibits a narrower angular distribution of the OOP (010) peak; meanwhile, SW2 has more randomly oriented stacking, thereby suggesting that SW1 favors to form more ordered molecular stacking, which is beneficial for charge transport and suppressing the charge recombination. Notably, SW1 has a smaller (100) lamellar stacking distance of 17.22 Å than that of SW2 (19.10 Å), indicating that it adopts closer molecular packing. Besides, the coherence length (Lc) values,34 determined from the full-width-at half-maximum of X-ray reflection (the Scherrer equation), are 11.86 Å for SW1, 10.92 Å for SW2, respectively (see Table S4†). Since Lc is related to the crystallite size and lattice order, the larger Lc value of SW1 results in fewer grain boundaries and therefore renders better charge transport properties as compared to SW2. In summary, SW1 forms regulated phase separation with an ordered interpenetrating network, while the SW2 film exists with a more random and aggregated domain, resulting in inefficient charge separation and transport properties, which would significantly influence the JSC and FF values of SMOSCs as further discussed below.

The photovoltaic performance of SW1 and SW2 is further characterized with SMOSCs with a conventional architecture of glass/indium tin oxide/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)/sole photoactive layer/PNDIT-F3N/Ag. The active layers are spin-coated from a CF solution with a concentration of 12 mg mL−1 and then annealed at different temperatures. The detailed optimization procedures are provided in Fig. S9 and S10,† and the corresponding parameters are shown in Tables S5 and S6.† The optimized current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the two dyads are demonstrated in Fig. 4a, and the photovoltaic parameters are exhibited in Table 1. SW1-based SMOSCs provide a PCE of 3.78% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.863 V, a JSC of 9.12 mA cm−2, and a FF of 46.1%. Notably, these are among the top values of SMOSCs reported thus far, and the highest value of non-fullerene acceptor-based SMOSCs in the literature (see Fig. 4b), and the cited references are summarized in Table S7.† Unfortunately, the SW2 device shows an extremely poor PCE of 0.25% with a VOC of 0.530 V, a JSC of 1.83 mA cm−2, and a FF of 26.2%. The massive differences in photovoltaic performance of the two SMOSCs are mainly ascribed to the parameters of JSC and FF, which mainly rely on the fundamental physical dynamics of the device as discussed below. Besides, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curve (Fig. S11†) of SW1 stays at about 40%, whereas the value of SW2 is below 10%, indicating that compared to SW1, the SW2 device suffers from more severe charge transport and extraction limitations. In order to highlight the advantages of two SMOSCs, we evaluated storage and operational stabilities of the two dyad-based SMOSCs. As shown in Fig. 4c, the two SMOSCs degraded down to around 93% after storage under dark conditions for 165 hours in a nitrogen-filled atmosphere. And then we also investigated the relevant devices under illumination for 165 hours. As shown in Fig. 4d, almost 90% of their initial PCEs remained for the two dyad-based devices. These results demonstrated that SMOSCs have a great advantage in potential applications due to their remarkable long-term stability.

The molecular charge transfer phenomenon of the two dyads is studied by steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL), as displayed in Fig. 5. First, we measured the steady-state PL spectra of Tz-IC2F, SW1, and SW2 films, excited at 639 nm. As provided in Fig. 5a, the fluorescence peaks, emitted by the three films, are located at around 970 nm. The PL of SW1 is highly quenched by 81.78%, higher than that of SW2 (73.08%), suggesting more efficient exciton dissociation and charge transfer in the SW1 film. The lower quenching efficiency of SW2 can well be explained by the separated and more random crystalline behavior of the donor and acceptor proven by DSC and topographical (Fig. 2 and 3) measurements, which can be the limiting factor for the low photocurrent of SW2.

Then, to further clarify the emission quenching behaviors, time-resolved PL (TRPL)35 experiments of Tz-IC2F and the two dyads in dilute chloroform solutions (Fig. S12†) and films (Fig. 5b) are also carried out. It is worth noting that the solutions of these samples should be diluted as much as possible (∼10−5 M), to avoid the existence of interaction between adjacent molecules. In Fig. S7,† it is possible to fit the decay of the three sample solutions with a single-exponential function. The fitting routines yield a similar fluorescence lifetime (τ) (606 ps for Tz-IC2F, 603 ps for SW1, and 625 ps for SW2 (Table S8†)), indicating that PL quenching in these solutions is almost affected by direct exciton decay; in other words, there is almost no intramolecular charge transfer in SW1 and SW2 diluted solutions, like the pristine material of Tz-IC2F. In solid films, by considering that both direct exciton decay and exciton splitting coexist, the TRPL signals are fitted with biexponential functions, and the corresponding data are compiled in Table S9.† Compared to the Tz-IC2F film (τavg = 556 ps), the fluorescence lifetimes of the two dyads (82 ps for SW1, 135 ps for SW2) decay much faster, due to the existence of intermolecular and intramolecular charge transfer. Furthermore, a little faster TRPL lifetime of SW1 than that of SW2, suggesting more effective exciton dissociation and charge separation in the SW1 film, is consistent with the results of steady-state PL (Fig. 5a).
To precisely probe the photoinduced exciton and charge generation dynamics, femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy36 was employed in two single photoactive layers. Here, the excitation pulse is tuned to 1.65 eV (750 nm) to selectively excite the Tz-IC2F unit but not donor units with the power density at 5 μJ cm−2, and after a certain delay time, the resulting dynamics are detected by measuring the relative transmission difference (ΔT/T) of the broadband probe pulsed in the range of 500 to 950 nm after the excitation. Both the spectra from neat Tz-IC2F (Fig. S13†) and two dyads (Fig. 5c and d) feature a bleaching peak at 810 nm owing to the combined contributions from the ground-state bleaching peaks and excited-state absorption of Tz-IC2F moieties. As can be seen in Table S10 and Fig. S14,† we determined the hole transfer process by the bi-exponential function fitting I = A1 exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2), with the fast and slow processes of τ1 and τ2 and pre-factors of A1 and A2. The former fast component τ1 is assigned to the ultrafast hole transfer process and the slow exciton-diffusion-mediated process as characterized by τ2. Both SW1 and SW2 exhibit similar fast increasing dynamics with characteristic times (τ1) of 0.23 fs and 0.24 fs, respectively, indicating a highly efficient hole transfer process at the D/A interface. However, the slow-increasing kinetics of the two dyads are different. As summarized in Table S10,† SW1 has a much higher exciton diffusion time τ2 (3.52 ps) accounting for 86.3%, in comparison to that of SW2 (2.10 ps) accounting for 64.3%, indicating that in SW2, the exciton can't efficiently diffuse to the D/A interfacial,37 which is closely related to the morphology of active layers as mentioned above.
Then, to more deeply assess the influence of charge transport properties on device performance, especially the JSC and FF values, the hole and electron-only mobilities were calculated using the space charge limited current method38 (Fig. S15†). The average hole/electron (μh/μe) mobilities are 3.54/4.86 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the optimized SW1 film (μh/μe = 0.73) and 8.33/4.46 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for SW2 (μh/μe = 1.87), respectively (Fig. 5g). In comparison with theSW2 film, SW1 exhibits higher and more balanced charge transport properties, resulting from the more ordered and tighter face-on π–π stacking and lamellar stacking, confirmed by the GIWAXS measurements (Fig. 3). We also evaluated the dwell time of charges in the active layer prior to being extracted at the electrodes by transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements (Fig. 5h). The dwell time of the corresponding devices was τ = 0.411 μs for SW1 and τ = 3.36 μs for SW2, respectively, indicating that photo-generated carriers are extracted more efficiently in the SW1 device. Notably, the higher electron mobility and reduced extraction lifetime, as well as ordered layer morphology of SW1, are beneficial to obtain much higher JSC and FF values than those of SW2.
Conclusion
In summary, we first designed and synthesized two molecular dyads, SW1 and SW2, by introducing an unfused non-fullerene acceptor as the acceptor segments and linear oligomers as the donor segments. Notably, the two dyads exhibit panchromatic absorption spectra within 400–850 nm and superior molar absorptivity. Impressively, the SW1 device demonstrates an inspiring PCE of 3.78% with a high JSC of 9.12 mA cm−2, which is a record high for non-fullerene acceptor-based SMOSCs in the literature thus far. The studies further provide a simple design principle for SMOSCs that the selection criteria of D and A segments are not just the matching of absorption and energy levels, but also molecular miscibility and crystallization. Additionally, the investigations of morphological characteristics and the analysis of physical mechanics shed light on the performance differences in SW1- and SW2-based SMOSCs. By taking advantage of the wisdom learned from advances in BHJ non-fullerene OSCs, we believe that this new strategy opens up the possibility for designing highly efficient non-fullerene acceptor-based single-component photovoltaic materials.
