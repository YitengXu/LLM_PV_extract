    , Accepted 14th January 2020First published on 15th January 2020AbstractRecent research on hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites has greatly advanced the fields of photovoltaics, photodetection, and light emission. The emergence of piezotronics and piezo-phototronics has led to tremendous high-performance devices that are based on piezoelectric materials. Although many previous research studies were centered around single crystal hybrid perovskites, polycrystalline materials are easier to fabricate, such as by using a solution-process, and have many other advantages, e.g. low cost, low environmental requirements, and high conversion efficiency. So far, there are very few reports of piezotronically modulated polycrystalline perovskite devices. Here, a novel piezo-phototronic effect enhanced photodetector based on MAPbI3 polycrystalline perovskite is designed, fabricated, and subsequently characterized. With polycrystalline materials, it is seen that the device performances can be significantly enhanced using the piezo-phototronic effect. Moreover, the polycrystalline perovskite introduces unprecedented potential to fine tune the devices from weak to strong piezoelectric performance. Our study explores the possibility of using polycrystalline perovskites to create high performance strain-controlled piezo-phototronic devices, which will have promising applications in the internet of things, multifunctional micro/nanoelectromechanical devices and sensor networks.
1. Introduction
Coupling semiconducting properties, the piezoelectric effect, and photoexcitation, piezotronics and piezo-phototronics1–6 have attracted extensive attention especially in the fields of energy harvesting,7–9 self-powered systems,10,11 nanogenerators,12–14 and biomedicine.4,15–17 The fundamental principle of piezo-phototronics has been reported that the energy band structure at the contact can be tuned by strain-induced polarization charges; as a result, the photoelectric process is controlled by mechanical stimulation.18 The piezo-phototronic effect has been reported to enhance the performance of photodetectors, solar cells with ZnO–CdS double-shell microwires,19 and MoS2 materials.20,21 A piezo-multifunctional structure of LixNbO3:Pr3+ was reported to have a high piezo-luminescence intensity far exceeding other well-known structures.22 Piezo-phototronic devices show exceptional superiority in light-emitting diodes (LEDs),18 logical devices,23–25 solar cells,26,27 strain gated vertical nanowire arrays,28 and ultrahigh-performance sensors.29–32 The transport, separation, and recombination processes of carriers are controlled by strain-induced polarization charges in those devices.
Recently, strain-tunable perovskite photodetectors based on MAPbI3 single crystals have been intensively studied, and the principle of photocurrent controlled by strain has been discussed.33 A MAPbI3 solar cell based on the piezo-phototronic effect has been fabricated to improve the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) by 40%.34 Based on the excellent properties of high absorption coefficient,35,36 long charge carrier lifetime,37,38 long diffusion length,39,40 high carrier mobility,41,42 and high piezoelectric coefficient,43 organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have been significantly attracting broad research interest.
Piezoelectric perovskite materials with organic–inorganic lead halide have attracted more and more attention, especially in the field of optoelectronics.43 The d33 of perovskite has been proven by direct optical testing, and it is 2.7 pm V−1 in the CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal and 6 pm V−1 in the polycrystalline film, obtained via the measurement of PFM (piezoresponse force microscopy).44,45 The piezoresponse of lead-halide perovskite has been investigated by PFM and found to exhibit polarization Ps = 13 μC cm−2.46 A related study of MAPbI3 polarization by density functional theory and symmetry mode analysis has been reported.47 The piezoelectric properties of perovskites are used to control or tune the performance of photodetector devices, and offer novel methods to improve the performance of photodetector devices, which is known as piezotronic and piezo-phototronic effects on perovskites.33
Perovskites can be prepared on a large scale by solution engineering,48,49 the printing method,50–52 and vapor-solution.53 They exhibit excellent coupling characteristics along with photovoltaic properties,54 semiconductor properties, and piezo-phototronics.33 The fabricated solar cells and photodetector devices are superior candidates for future optoelectronic devices. Photodetectors based on perovskites, converting visible optical signals to electrical signals instantaneously, have various potential in high performance sensing,55,56 image processing,57 and optical communication.58 Hybrid perovskite single-crystal photodetectors have been reported to demonstrate a very narrow spectral response, with a full-width at half-maximum of <20 nm.59 So far, apart from the majority of photodetectors that use vertical heterojunctions, photodetectors using planar structures have shown greater advantages for planar photodetector arrays and image processing.19,60 Three-dimensional vertical perovskite nanowire arrays have been designed to achieve high-performance optoelectronic devices.61 Meanwhile, solar cell devices made from perovskite materials have been attracting more attention, and their current efficiency has reached 25.2%.62 Stability of the MAPbI3 solar cell is reported to be >1000 hours, obtained by using double layers of mesoporous TiO2 and ZrO2 as a scaffold.63
The main feature of Schottky-diode based photodetectors is the metal–semiconductor contact. The barrier height at the contact can be predicted by the Schottky–Mott rule on the basis of the relative alignment of energy levels in the ideal case. Metal–semiconductor contacts, known as the Schottky barrier, are at the core of current electronics, optoelectronics, and integrated circuits.64,65 One of the most significant parameters of the metal–semiconductor contact is the Schottky barrier height (ΦSB). The Schottky barrier height is the energy barrier for charge carriers (electron or hole) to pass through the contact, which can essentially characterize the efficiency of charge transport and performance of the whole device. When applying strain, the polarized charge causes piezoelectric potential in the contact region, resulting in unbalanced carrier distributions. As a result, the energy band at both ends of the device appears asymmetric. This mechanism causes different changes in the Schottky potential on both sides. The piezoelectric polarization caused by strains in a pseudo-semiconductor heterostructure can change the electronic and optoelectronic properties of the semiconductor, such as the spectral response of the light modulator and the threshold voltage of the electron-field effect transistor. The barrier height under the applied stress changes, and the free charge carrier density neutralizes strain-induced polarization charges in the semiconductor–metal interface, affecting the Fermi level relative to the edge of the surface contact conduction band.
In this paper, a new photodetector based on polycrystalline MAPbI3 is designed in response to the changes of light intensity and mechanical strain. Controllable strain changes the distribution of the polarized electric field by polarized charges. Strain, as a mechanical stimulation, enhances the separation process of electron–hole pairs and hinders the electron–hole recombination process, regulating the positive and negative charge distribution at the interface of the contact. Thus, the strain-induced piezoelectric field causes an asymmetric change in the Schottky barriers and energy levels. While the strain causes a build-up of negative charges at the contact interface, the Schottky barrier rises, and the current decreases. The opposite situation causes the Schottky barrier to move down and the current increases. In this work, the mechanism of strain controlled Schottky barriers in organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite (MAPbI3) polycrystalline devices has been investigated, which provides a fundamental model for future human–computer interaction and multi-functional micro-nano systems.
2. Results and discussion
The experimental process of the perovskite photodetector includes the preparation of the perovskite layer, the array plating process, and the experimental measurement, which are shown in Fig. 1. The prepared 1 mol L−1 MAPbI3 solution, as shown in Fig. 1a, was made by mixing MAI and PbI2 in a ratio of 1:1, and the solvent was DMF mixed DMSO in a ratio of 9:1. Subsequently, the MAPbI3 solution was placed on a mixing table at a temperature of 60 °C for two hours. The process of perovskite deposition on PET was done using the one-step spin coating method. The rotation speed started slow and then became faster for 40 seconds. During this time, chlorobenzene was added as an anti-solvent, as shown in Fig. 1b. Fig. 1c shows the annealing process. For solution treated perovskites, the formation of perovskites may occur in the temperature range of 40–160 °C.66 It has been reported that MAPbI3 is annealed at 100 °C to form a uniform black film with a stable absorption profile because the time required for complete conversion of the perovskite film is effectively reduced under annealing conditions.67 In order to obtain a perovskite photodetector array, we used a shadow mask on the surface of the perovskite during the electrode plating process so that Au can be deposited according to the predetermined structure, as shown in Fig. 1d. The jagged channel of the unit between the two electrodes is very narrow and more efficient than parallel channels. The digital image of the prepared photodetector array is shown in Fig. 1e, showing that Au (higher stability than other metals on perovskites) was electroplated onto a PET or flexible substrate (polyimide) in a 4 × 5 matrix structure by a coater. In addition to the PET substrate, the photodetector array can also be deposited onto a polyimide film. In our study, we fabricated the device by spin-coating perovskite polycrystalline films onto the PET substrate, which is bent to produce the tensile strain. For the positive polarization case, the tensile strain induces positive polarization charges, which decrease the potential barrier height. For the negative polarization case, the tensile strain induces negative polarization charges, which increase the potential barrier height. A Keithley 4200 was used to measure the electrical characteristics, which was connected to the device with probes. In the dark environment, the influence of external light is excluded, and a beam of light is introduced from the microscope to the detector device. The I–V characteristic of the photodetector was tested using a microscope with various strains. Fig. 1f shows a deformation generator, and the device is bent due to the displacement of the baffle. The value of the strain is calculated by the formula shown in Fig. 1f. Initially, the PET substrate with a photodetector array was placed horizontally without strain. Then, the PET substrate was slowly stressed, and the center of the PET substrate was lifted upward. Since PET has a certain thickness, the MAPbI3 film on the upper surface of the substrate is stretched by the surface. The length of the PET substrate is L bent by the displacement actuator, and the length change of the PET substrate is Δx under the horizontal stress. The slope θ is consistent with the change in the baffle displacement of the displacement actuator.

Organic–inorganic hybrid lead-containing perovskites have a common general formula CnH2n+1NH3PbX3, mainly consisting of the following two structures: the tetragonal perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 and the orthorhombic perovskite CH3NH3PbI3. The skeleton consists of Pb and I, whose unit is a cage surrounded by PbI6, and CH3NH3+ moves conditionally in the skeleton. Fig. 2a shows the two crystal structures of the perovskite. The XRD pattern of MAPbI3 at room temperature is shown in Fig. 2b. Through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the top view SEM image is shown in Fig. 2c, demonstrating a completely covered perovskite film structure. The absorption spectra demonstrate the absorption range of ∼350–900 nm, and the peak is near 500 nm, as shown in Fig. 2d. In the XRD pattern, we observe two characteristic perovskite peaks near 14° and 28° (2θ), corresponding to (110) and (220) crystal directions. Extremely low peaks in other directions indicate that the intensity of the intermediate phases is weak.

We have studied the photocurrent–voltage characteristics of the MAPbI3 photodetector at various strains or different illumination power densities, as shown in Fig. 3a and b. The optical white light illumination source uses an XZ-105WA halogen lamp to conduct the characterization of the photodetector with a wavelength range of ∼400–800 nm to mimic the irradiation of sunlight. The photocurrent presents 253 nA, 248 nA, 108 nA, and 99 nA with a fixed bias voltage of 10 V, forming a decreasing trajectory with strain ranging from 0% to 1.4%, 3.4% and 4.7%, with the power density fixed at 31.7 μW cm−2, which is shown in Fig. 3a. The I–V characteristics at fixed strain of 1.4% with the power density ranging from 6.6 μW cm−2 to 16.5 μW cm−2, 31.7 μW cm−2 and 84.6 μW cm−2 are presented in Fig. 3b. When the strain is 1.4%, the device displays photocurrents of 120 nA, 248 nA, 389 nA, and 586 nA, at the fixed bias voltage of 10 V. Experimental observations show that the illumination is positively correlated with the current. The increasing strain causes the I–V curve to become flattened, indicating that the Schottky barrier is enhanced by the strain and the device conductance decreases with the strain. Fig. 3d shows that the photocurrent decreases with the strain, describing the effect of polarized charges due to strains with various power densities. In the strain range of 1.5% to 3%, the curves have larger slopes. For the polymorphic perovskite structure, the polar directions of the crystals are different due to the random distribution of asymmetric structures. The polar direction, which accounts for the majority of the ratio, controls the polarity of the entire structure. For the Schottky contact, positive charges on the surface will change the energy band and decrease the Schottky barrier height. The existence of ferroelectric domains, electrochemical phenomena, ion migration, electrostatic effects, and other factors will reduce the piezotronic effect on polycrystalline MAPbI3.

(b) I–V characteristics with different illumination power densities under 1.4% strain. (c) Current versus illumination power density under various strains. (d) I–ε curves with different illumination power densities. 
The cross-sectional view of the photodetector shows a sandwiched structure of PET/perovskite/Au, as shown in Fig. 4a. The perovskite layer is stacked by the interdiffusion of the lead iodide (PbI2) solution and methyl ammonium halide (MAI) solution by spin-coating. Then, according to the predetermined shape, the parallel electrode is plated on the upper surface of the perovskite. When a beam of light is incident on the top surface, free carriers inside MAPbI3 are generated. Most photogenerated excitons are dissociated into free charges in the perovskite layer, and the electrodes can effectively collect free charges even without electron or hole receiving layers. In the case of the presence of an applied voltage, carriers (electron–hole pairs) are excited by light and subsequently separated. There are defects generated in the crystal during the poling process. The intense local piezoelectric effect is exhibited in organometallic trihalide perovskite (OTP) polycrystals due to grain boundaries caused by piezoelectric polarization induced by polycrystalline ion migration.44 When the bias voltage is applied at both ends, the drift of the electron and hole pairs is accelerated, and the electrons and holes accumulate near the positive and negative metal–semiconductor contacts. At this time, the third factor, strain, as the external control condition, regulates the strain-induced polarization charges inside the metal semiconductor, and regulates the Schottky barrier of the metal semiconductor interface by the piezoelectric potential caused by the polarization charge.57Fig. 4b displays the poling electric field distribution on the top surface, which is a nonuniform electric field induced by lateral-structured electrodes leading to polarized charge displacements under applied voltages. The polarization charges accumulate at both ends to form a narrow piezoelectric potential region. Under the strain and illumination, electric field, the drift of carriers, separation of electron–hole pairs, and recombination processes are regulated, and the electrical current changes. The regulation of the strain on the device can be classified into two aspects. The negative polarization charges promote the drift of the electrons to the metal–semiconductor contact, and the Schottky barrier of the metal semiconductor interface increases, so the photocurrent decreases (Fig. 4e). The positive polarization charges enable the free electron to drift away from the barrier, and the Schottky barrier height of the metal–semiconductor interface decreases, therefore the photocurrent increases, as shown in Fig. 4f. The height of the Schottky barrier on both sides shows a similar change, increasing (decreasing) the corresponding SBHs of local contacts. Fig. 4c and d demonstrate changes in the Schottky band of the metal–semiconductor interface induced by applied strains.

(e) An increase in the Schottky barrier, due to the movement of polarized charge carriers. (f) A decrease in the Schottky barrier, due to the opposite movement direction of the polarized charge carriers to the electric field. 
Alongside the study of electric field and light effects, we introduce strain as the third variable quantity. The piezotronic properties of the MAPbI3 crystal have been experimentally proved. Piezoelectric properties are directly related to the displacement of ions at different lattice positions. MAPbI3 single crystals show a strong piezoelectric behavior after piezoelectric poling along the [001] direction, and rectification can be improved.44 Strain-induced piezoelectric charges can significantly enhance the performance in a photodetector device based on MAPbI3 single crystals.33 For the prepared polymorphic MAPbI3 crystal, due to lattice polarities in different directions, the direction of the piezoelectric electric field generated by the strain will also be random. The piezoelectric induced electric field in the same direction as the applied electric field will reduce the energy band of the contact region, while the opposite behavior will increase the energy band of the contact region. The band change induced by strain is indicated by a dotted line in Fig. 4c and d. The effect of piezoelectric polarization on SBH is due to polarization generated charges at the metal–semiconductor interface, thereby changing the local Fermi level and adjusting the local conduction band distributions.
If the polarization directions of most charges tend to be uniform, overall piezoelectric properties are clearly observed. A strain-induced SBH change affects the electric characteristics of the contact. Fig. 5a and b display the positive effect of strain on polarized charges. The photocurrent induced by the power density of 6.6 μW cm−2 increases with the increase of the tensile strain. When the tensile strain increases to 1.4%, the photocurrent under 10 V bias voltage rises from 4 to 5 nA. When the tensile strain further increases from 1.4% to 3.4%, the photocurrent increases to 13 nA. The current induced by 3.4% is 2.6 times higher than the current with the strain of 1.4%. When the tensile strain further increases from 3.4% to 4.7%, the photocurrent increases to 16 nA. The photocurrent under the power density of 6.6 μW cm−2 as a function of the bias voltage under different tensile strains is shown in Fig. 5a. The light-induced photocurrent as a function of strain is displayed in Fig. 5b with bias voltages of 2.5 V, 5.0 V, 7.5 V, and 10 V, describing the relationship between photocurrent and strain. It is found that the photocurrent at 10 V bias monotonously increases with the applied tensile strain. At the same time, polycrystalline material devices seldom change upon strain, as shown in Fig. 5c and d. This is due to the polarized charges interacting with each other in the device. In our non-polarization devices, the changes of current–voltage characteristics show that the performance of the device is independent of polarization. This case can be considered as strain independent. The resistance of perovskite polycrystalline films changes upon strain, indicating that the piezoresistance effect plays a crucial role. The piezoresistance type device exhibits linearly symmetric I–V photoelectric behavior. The piezo-phototronic devices have nonlinear current–voltage characteristics. The measurements in Fig. 5 imply that the polycrystalline perovskites have great advantages of generating devices that have much greater piezotronic effects, as well as strain-free devices that have applications in certain areas.

According to previous works, D. Pesquera et al. have shown the effects of symmetry breaking (strain ranging from 0.3% to 0.9%), indicating that the strain can tune the (3z2 − r2/x2 − y2) occupancy ratio and the metal–oxygen bond lengths of oxides.68 V. Laukhin et al. reported that strain-driven structural transformations lead to electronic sub-band reconfiguration in a d0-perovskite.69 The change in the morphology and structure of perovskites leads to the various changes in material properties, such as polarization, ferroelectricity properties,70 ionic properties,71 lattice parameters,72 and charge transfer kinetics of the electrode interface.73 In our study, the strain also changes the morphology and structure of perovskite polycrystals. However, the polarization charges play an important role in the current–voltage characteristics of our piezo-phototronic polycrystalline perovskite photodetectors. The morphological and structural changes upon strain are neglected in our works. Because the devices have the same materials and structure, and tensile strain is applied under the same conditions, in our experiments, there are three cases: the positive polarization charge case (Fig. 5a), the negative polarization charge case (Fig. 3a), and the non-polarization charge case (Fig. 5c), respectively.
The photoresponsivity R is given by33 (1)where Ilight, Idark, and Iill are the photocurrent, dark current and excitation power density, respectively. S is the effective light area, and Pill is the illumination power. Thus, its relative change, Δ, is calculated by33 (2)

Fig. 6a and b illustrate the change in photoresponsivity by the positive and negative polarization charges, respectively. The positive polarization charges promote the improvement of photoresponsivity with the strain, under various bias voltages at the power density of 6.6 μW cm−2, while the negative polarization charges show a decreasing trend with the strain at the power density of 31.7 μW cm−2. In Fig. 6c, ΔR/R increases with the strain at a higher bias voltage of 10 V. Under lower bias voltage, ΔR/R has a minimum value under various strains from 0% to 4.7%. Fig. 6d shows the opposite trend by strain-induced negative polarization charges. These results indicate that applied strain can effectively modulate the sensitivity of the photodetector.

(b) R, photoresponsivity, and ΔR/R, relative change (d), of photoresponsivity of the device with various bias in the negative polarization charge case. 

Fig. 7 illustrates response time versus strain under positive and negative polarization charges at the illumination power density of 31.7 μW cm−2 with a bias voltage of 10 V. The response time has a similar tendency with photoresponsivity induced by strain. In the negative polarization charge case, the response time increases from 0.809 s to 1.114 s with strain from 0% to 4.7%, while the response time decreases from 0.947 s to 0.587 s, under positive polarization charges. Fig. 7c shows that the response time decreases with strain in the positive polarization charge case. In the negative polarization charge case, the response time increases with strain. Thus, the response time of the device based on MAPbI3 polycrystalline films can be obviously affected by strain.

The piezo-phototronic effect tuning the device performance under the mechanical strain has novel applications in high-resolution strain mapping, high-sensitivity smart sensing devices, and micro/nano optoelectronic-mechanical systems. For example, a high-resolution electroluminescent imaging device was fabricated by composing n-ZnO nanowire/p-GaN light-emitting diode arrays to produce a pressure map under a compressive strain.74 InGaN/GaN multiple quantum well based high-resolution dynamic tactile/pressure displays were reported to have a 6350 dpi pixel density for linear strain (0–0.15%).75 An n-ZnO/p-SnS core–shell NW array solar cell can be effectively enhanced by bending the structure of the solar cell devices.26 Chen et al. explored a ZnO–Ga2O3 core–shell heterojunction microwire that is highly sensitive to UV light.76 The strain-controlled photodetector under −0.042% strain achieved three times higher sensitivity than that without strain.76
3. Conclusion
In summary, an array of photodetectors based on an organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite (MAPbI3) regulated by strain has been demonstrated. The effects of light, voltage, and strain on the photodetector have been thoroughly investigated through systematic experimentations. The change in photocurrent caused by strains is further explored. The photodetector based on MAPbI3 on a flexible substrate can be regulated by strain, as the Schottky barrier of the Au–MAPbI3 contact is profoundly affected by the strain, and the electric field formed by polarization charges caused by the strain tunes the transport, separation, and recombination of the carriers. This work provides a novel investigation on a polycrystalline perovskite strain-modulated photo detecting mechanism, which will have much greater practicality than single crystalline perovskite devices.
4. Experimental method
4.1 Device fabrication
The PET substrate (thickness of ∼1 mm) was cleaned in turn by deionized water and ethanol for about 45 min respectively, and the cleaned PET substrates were put in a plasma generator to produce rough surfaces, facilitating the spin coating process of the solution. Then, a layer of MAPbI3 film was grown by using the spin-coating method. The MAPbI3 precursor, which compounded PbI2 and methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) with a density of 1 M, was dissolved in an organic mixed solution (DMF 90%, DMSO 10%) at a temperature of 60 °C with ∼2 h of the mixing process. After spin-coating, the system was annealed on a hot stage for ∼10 min at 100 °C and then cooled to room temperature naturally, and chlorobenzene was added during this period. After that, the Au electrode layer was electroplated on the top surface of the MAPbI3 layer by DC magnetron sputtering at room temperature.
4.2 Characterization
We performed I–V tests using the setup composed of a Keithley 4200 and a Micromanipulator 6150 probe station at room temperature and ambient air pressure. The optical source is the white light from a Z-105WA halogen lamp. Absorption spectra were quantified using a JASCO V-570 spectrophotometer.
