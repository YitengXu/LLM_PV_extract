This review article broadly gives the up-to-date status on promising electrocatalysts for the degradation of HOPs, with particular emphasis on the strategies for promoting the activities of catalysts.

Environmental significance
Electrocatalysis is an efficient approach for the degradation of halogenated organic pollutants. Currently, both electrooxidative and electroreductive dehalogenation processes are widely applied, and the key challenge lies in the development of high-performance electrocatalysts. Given the rapid advances in the design and development of efficient catalysts towards electrochemical dehalogenation, this review aims to summarise recent progress in popular electrocatalysts and theoretical understanding of dehalogenation processes. Additionally, several key prospects in this field are presented. This critical review can facilitate the design and application of next-generation electrocatalysts with ameliorated performances.

1. Introduction
Halogenated organic compounds, namely organics containing one or more of the elements fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br) and iodine (I), have aroused increasing concerns as they pose threats to aquatic species as well as human beings. These organics are widely employed in many industrial and consumer products such as pesticides, flame retardants, fungicides, insecticides, dyes, dielectrics, coolants, plant regulators, plasticizers, and drugs.1–4 Due to their high consumption during the past few years, these compounds have been detected in air, water, and soil, which results in severe environmental pollution owing to their high toxicity, persistence, bioaccumulation, and wide distribution.4,5
Under such circumstances, effective methods to degrade these halogenated organic pollutants (HOPs) are in demand. In the last few decades, extensive efforts have been devoted to the degradation of HOPs. Particularly, many processes have been developed to cleave the strong C–X bonds (X = F, Cl, Br and I) in HOPs, such as microbial degradation,6,7 ionizing radiation,8,9 metallic reduction,10–12 photochemistry and photocatalysis,13–15 sonolysis,16,17 and electrocatalysis.18–21 Although it is highly difficult to compare the efficiency of different degradation methods due to various target pollutants, initial concentrations, sources of pollution, experimental setups and different physicochemical parameters of the processes applied,22 electrocatalysis distinguishes itself from these methods for its easy implementation, high energy efficiency, amenability of automation and safety, versatility, high effectiveness, universal degradation capability, and environmental compatibility.1,23–26
As a destructive technology for HOP degradation,27 especially for persistent perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), electrocatalysis has attracted much more attention recently.28 Several previous publications have discussed the application of electrocatalysis in the dehalogenation process.1,2,28–32 For example, Rondinini et al.1 reviewed the electroreduction of organic halides in terms of electrode reaction mechanisms, electrode materials and process operation. Martin et al.2 considered many vital aspects of the electroreduction process of HOPs, including cell designs, experimental methods, and degradation mechanisms. In an earlier work by the same group, the electrochemical reduction of halogenated organic compounds was also discussed regarding the species of pollutants.32 Apart from electrochemical reduction, Niu and coworkers28 reviewed the electrooxidation of perfluorinated compounds, and the major focus was on the electrode types and operational factors, including potential, current density, pH value, plate distance, etc. These informative articles have provided an overview of the electrocatalytic degradation processes of HOPs related to reduction or oxidation; however, the catalysts applied in this field have not been comprehensively reviewed. In fact, it is now widely recognized that electrocatalysts (electrodes) play a key role in the degradation of HOPs,33,34 and explosive development of innovative catalysts has been pushing the boundaries of HOP degradation speedily during the past few years. Nevertheless, to date, no attempt has been made to provide a comprehensive summary of these recent findings to facilitate the development of new effective catalysts.
Therefore, in this review article, we summarize the recent development in electrochemical dehalogenation catalysts, focusing on the key strategies for promoting the activities of catalysts, as well as the connections between the properties of catalysts (such as morphology, chemical components, and conformation) and their catalytic performance. In addition, the key mechanisms accounting for electrooxidative dehalogenation (EOD) and electroreductive dehalogenation (ERD) are highlighted, as well as the advanced integrated techniques. Based on this review, the outlook on key future research directions is also pointed out.
2. Catalysts for electrooxidative dehalogenation
Electrooxidation has been proved as an effective method to mineralize halogenated organic pollutants. To date, numerous catalysts have been applied in the electrooxidative dehalogenation process. This section provides an overview of the main catalysts (anodes) in EOD, including metal oxide (PbO2, SnO2, and others)-based and carbon (boron-doped diamond and others)-based electrodes. The diverse modification strategies that have been applied to upgrade the performance of these electrodes are also highlighted. Furthermore, the main electrooxidative dehalogenation mechanisms are discussed.
2.1. PbO2-based catalysts
PbO2-based catalysts have been widely explored as electrode materials in EOD since they possess many merits, including low cost, high conductivity, chemical resistance, and high oxygen overvoltage.23,33,35Table 1 summarizes the recent representative studies of EOD by various PbO2-based catalytic materials. These results clearly suggest that the structure and components of the catalysts have a vital influence on their degradation performance. The effective measures that can upgrade the catalytic potential of PbO2-based catalysts are detailed in this work.

Pristine PbO2 materials are excellent candidates for EOD due to their high catalytic activity, good chemical stability, great conductivity, and low cost.36 Normally, the traditional PbO2 coated catalysts can flake from the substrate (e.g., Ti sheets) due to their relatively large interface resistance.28 To address this problem, interlayers have been introduced to increase the chemical stability and thus the degradation performance of the PbO2 electrode.36–38 For example, Niu et al.38 used SnO2–Sb as an interlayer to construct a Ti/SnO2–Sb/PbO2 anode with the electrodeposition method for the decay of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). The degradation of PFOA followed pseudo-first-order kinetics and the degradation efficiency on the Ti/SnO2–Sb/PbO2 anode achieved 91.1%, with the defluorination rate of PFOA being 77.4%. Recently, the same group found that TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNAs*) performed better than SnO2–Sb when used as a transition layer for the defluorination of fluoxetine (FLX).39 They noticed that the particles on the Ti/TNAs*/PbO2 anode are smaller and distributed much more compactly than those on the Ti/SnO2–Sb/PbO2 and Ti/PbO2 anodes (Fig. 1a–c). Impressively, the optimized electronic transport through the “T-shaped” electrode (Fig. 1d) and the improved hydroxyl radical yield derived from selective PbO2 crystal face growth could facilitate the degradation process (Fig. 1e and f). Other than metallic oxides, a graphene nanosheet was also employed as an interlayer to construct a novel PbO2 electrode (GNS-PbO2) for degradation of 2-chlorophenol (2-CP).36 GNS-PbO2 displayed better electrochemical activities, a higher dehalogenation rate constant and a better service lifetime than the conventional PbO2 electrode.

However, several defects of the pure PbO2 catalyst have limited its widespread applications, including leaching of toxic Pb ions and relatively large interface resistance.28,40 Furthermore, the electrocatalytic activity of bare PbO2 electrodes still requires further improvements.38,41,42 Therefore, it is crucial to enhance the stability and electrocatalytic activity of PbO2 electrodes, with doping, compositing, and surface modification being reported as efficient ways to achieve the goal.40,43–45 To date, many foreign compositions have been doped on PbO2 surfaces, such as Bi, Fe, Al, F, Co, Ce, Yb, Gd, Er, La, Au, Zr, Ni, and Sn.28,33,40,44,46–49 Among them, Ce is the most used dopant because Ce element can offer PbO2 a new nucleation center that enhances the electron transfer capacity, minimizes the internal stress of PbO2 crystals, hampers the further growth of PbO2 and decreases its average size.23,28 Hence, Ce-doped PbO2 catalysts display upgraded electrocatalytic performance towards HOPs. For example, a well-designed TiO2-NTs/Ce–PbO2 electrode was prepared for the elimination of rhodamine B (RhB).23 Compared to the TiO2-NTs/PbO2 electrode, the incorporation of Ce favored the generation of a denser and smoother film, with decreased crystal size, as well as a higher exposure of the preferred crystalline orientation. The small crystals provided more active sites for electrochemical oxidation, and the dense film hindered the penetration of electrolytes. The abundant active sites and great durability resulting from Ce-doping improve the overall electrochemical performance. Recently, metals other than Ce have gained more attention as efficient dopants in the fabrication of PbO2-based electrodes due to their better dehalogenation capabilities. As a good example, in the mineralization of enrofloxacin (ENR), Wang and coworkers43 found that the Ti/SnO2–Sb/La–PbO2 electrode was much more compact than Ti/SnO2–Sb/Ce–PbO2 and Ti/SnO2–Sb/PbO2 electrodes (Fig. 2a–c), and La doping significantly reduced the crystallite size of β-PbO2 (Fig. 2d). Accordingly, La-doped materials may provide more active sites for the generation of radicals. As a result, these characteristics of the La-doped electrode showed better degradation performance (Fig. 2e and f).

Compositing is another useful strategy to obtain a significant leap in the dehalogenation performance of catalysts since composite-based electrodes possess a superior lifetime, high HOP, great chemical stability, and excellent degradation power.50 For PbO2, the commonly employed incorporated metal oxides include CeO2, ZrO2, Co3O4, RuO2, and TiO2.51 Among these, the PbO2–CeO2 composite electrode is a powerful candidate for EOD.34,45,46 This composite is usually fabricated using a composite electrodeposition method, which can obtain higher cerium contents than the aforementioned Ce–PbO2 electrode.34,45 Therefore, the electrocatalytic ability and chemical stability of the PbO2–CeO2 composite electrode are higher than those of the Ce–PbO2 electrode.45 A novel three-dimensional PbO2–CeO2 composite electrode was fabricated with a composite electrodeposition method using oxygen bubbles as a template.34 The 3D/PbO2–CeO2 composite electrode possessed a three-dimensional interconnected porous structure, and the CeO2 nanoparticles were observed on pore walls. Moreover, the composite electrode exhibited noteworthy capability in hydroxyl radical generation resulting from the high OEP as well as the high specific surface area, with thiamethoxam being completely mineralized into CO2 and H2O after electrolysis for 90 min. Alternatively, PbO2–ZrO2 and Ga2O3–PbO2 have also been employed to remove HOPs successfully.52,53
The hydrophobic properties of anodes also have a significant impact on the OEP and the production of ˙OH radicals that are the main active components in the EOD process. Thus regulating the surface properties of PbO2 from hydrophilic to hydrophobic is greatly advisable.41,54 Consequently, surfactants and polymers are widely applied as additives to upgrade the surface properties of anodes. For instance, a PbO2 electrode modified with hydrophobic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) was employed to degrade PFOA, and experimental results illustrated that the designed electrode still kept the β-PbO2 crystallographic structure.37 The PVDF modified anode exhibited a rough face and the small particles were uniformly distributed. The nanostructures could significantly improve the specific area, and provide abundant reactivity points for the generation of hydroxyl radicals. The presence of PVDF also enhanced the hydrophobicity and the lifetime of the bare PbO2 electrode. Correspondingly, the Ti/SnO2–Sb2O5/PbO2–PVDF anode showed a higher degradation efficiency of PFOA than Ti/SnO2–Sb2O5/PbO2.
The particle size of catalysts also affects the electrocatalytic performance significantly, and a smaller size is more favorable due to more active sites for catalytic reactions. Duan and co-researchers55 fabricated a lauryl benzene sulfonic acid sodium (LAS)-carbon nanotube (CNT)-modified PbO2 electrode using thermal deposition and electrodeposition methods, and this modified anode exhibited better degradation performance for 4-chlorophenol than the PbO2 electrode. It was found that the crystal particles on the LAS-CNT-PbO2 anode were evidently smaller than those on the PbO2 anode, and its special surface structure consisted of small “stars with four corners” like crystallites. In addition, many bumps appeared on the surface of the LAS-CNT-PbO2 anode, and such a feature resulted in a larger effective surface area for the production of active radicals. Altogether, these characteristics of surface morphology and coating composition play a vital role in enhancing the capacity of the anode.
2.2. SnO2-based catalysts
SnO2-based electrocatalysts are frequently used to mineralize HOPs, though SnO2 is an n-type semiconductor with a band gap of 3.6 eV.65 To fully expand the range of its applications, doping is the most widely employed strategy to change the intrinsic properties of SnO2 and make it a hotspot in the field of electrode materials. Several sophisticated doped SnO2-based catalysts and their applications are discussed in this work.

Table 2 summarizes the recent representative SnO2-based catalytic anodes used in the process of HOP oxidation. It can be found that antimony (Sb) is the most general dopant as Sb-doped anodes possess high OEP, high stability and favorable electrocatalytic characteristics.66,67 For instance, a SnO2–Sb/Ti electrode fabricated with the sol–gel method was employed for the degradation of ciprofloxacin.68 The coating particles of the anode were uniform in size, with diameters ranging from 20–100 nm. The nanostructure of the SnO2–Sb/Ti anode exhibited a large surface area, and thereby provided plentiful active sites for the electrocatalytic process. In 120 min, the removal ratios of ciprofloxacin, COD, and TOC were around 99.5%, 86.0%, and 70.0%, respectively.

Components (e.g., F, Ni, Bi, Fe, Ru, Co, Ce, Pd, and TiN) often work as co-dopants to improve the performance of the Sb–SnO2 electrode.65,69–71 Yang et al.65 analyzed the effect of six elements (e.g., Fe(III), Ni(II), Co(II), Ru(III), Ce(III), and Pd(II)) on the performance of the Sb–SnO2 electrode toward mineralization of Eosin Y. In this study, both Ni and Fe could upgrade the electrocatalytic activities of Sb (5%)–SnO2, especially Ni. Further study implied that the improvement by Ni doping might be ascribed to the elevated involvement of organic peroxy radicals. Recently, a well-designed F and Sb co-doped SnO2 anode displayed excellent capacities in the degradation of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS).69 The co-doped electrode presented better degradation capacities than the single doped electrodes, and the main reason was that the formed smooth surface could provide more physically adsorbed ˙OH radicals and result in a relatively high OEP. TiN, as a kind of metal nitride, has been extensively employed as an electrode material due to its unique features, such as relatively low cost, high hardness, good chemical stability, great electric conductivity, and superior catalytic activities.72,73 Duan et al.70 prepared a Ti/Sb–SnO2–TiN anode for degradation of methylene blue. The TiN-doped anode exhibited a smaller crystal grain size, which thereby boosted the active sites and specific surface area for the electrocatalytic reaction. In addition, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests suggested that the introduction of TiN could obviously decrease the charge transfer resistance (150 ohm vs.1334 ohm), thus improving the conductivity of the anode. Compared with Ti/Sb–SnO2, Ti/Sb–SnO2–TiN had a higher adsorption capacity of hydroxyl oxygen species (1.97 times), as well as a higher decolorization efficiency (1.54 times) and a larger kinetic rate constant (3.24 times).
With good stability and great electrocatalytic activity, SnO2-based mixed metal oxide materials are also favourable anodes in the electrocatalytic dehalogenation process.74 For example, Bai and co-authors75 designed a Ti/SnO2–RuO2 electrode to decompose bromocresol green (BCG) in wastewater. The “cracked-mud” structure electrode showed a high specific surface area, which could provide abundant active sites and enhance the catalytic performance. Under the optimal experimental conditions, the removal ratio of BCG reached 91% within 150 min. Vargas et al.76 fabricated a SnO2–Sb2O5 anode to mineralize dichlorvos (DDVP) which is a widely used organophosphorus insecticide. The reaction kinetics for DDVP electrochemical oxidation was higher than those of other advanced oxidation methods (e.g., TiO2/UV and ZnO/UV), and the COD could be completely removed in about 100 min.
2.3. Other metal oxide-based catalysts
Like the oxides of Pb and Sn, other metal oxides (e.g., RuO2, Bi2O3, IrO2, and Ti4O7) have also been employed as electrodes in recent years owing to their relatively low cost, high chemical stability and superior electrocatalytic activities.85,86Table 3 lists the recent representative studies involving the electrochemical oxidation of HOPs by metal oxide (except PbO2 and SnO2)-based catalytic materials. Among these, RuO2- and Ti4O7-based electrodes are underlined in this work as two typical examples.

RuO2 has emerged as a promising candidate for mineralization of HOPs owing to its high stability, high OEP, great electrochemical performance and low cost.86,87 In addition, RuO2 showed high capacity toward the generation of active oxidants such as chlorine, ozone, and free radicals.88 Kaur and co-authors86 used the Ti/RuO2 anode to decay ofloxacin antibiotic (OFLX), and experimental results suggested that H2O2, HO2˙, HOCl, ClO− and chemisorbed ˙OH are all active components in the degradation process. As a result, the removal ratios of OFLX and TOC were about 80% (30 min) and 46.3% (240 min), respectively. To enhance the performance of the RuO2 anode through enlarging the electrochemical surface area, Zhang et al.89 fabricated a tubular porous Ti–RuO2 electrode and designed a corresponding reactor to degrade anticancer drugs in wastewater containing 5-fluoro-2-methoxypyrimidine (5FMP). The electrode with a porous structure had a larger active surface area than the plate electrode with the same geometrical area. Additionally, the micro-sized pores of the Ti–RuO2 electrode achieved a vertical flow between the anode and cathode in the presence of a pump. As a result, the designed reactor could not only improve the mass transfer process but also generate a homogeneous velocity distribution and high turbulent mixing around the electrode. Due to these merits, 5FMP was completely removed and the removal efficiency of COD reached 84.1%, within 180 min of electrocatalysis.
Ti4O7 which is a Magnéli phase titanium sub-oxide has been suggested as a good candidate for electrodes owing to its great conductivity (∼1000 S cm−1), high OEP (2.6 V/SHE, standard hydrogen electrode), good chemical stability, and easy preparation.90–92 Therefore, Magnéli phase Ti4O7 ceramic materials have been widely used as anodes in the electrochemical purification of wastewater. Lin et al.92 found that macroporous Magnéli phase Ti4O7 ceramic materials possessed interconnecting macropores, with size ranging within 1–8 μm (Fig. 3a–d). Compared to Ce–PbO2 and BDD anodes, the porous Ti4O7 ceramic electrode had a greater surface area and enhanced interphase mass transfer, thus improving the overall current efficiency. As a result, the porous anode exhibited better performance than Ce–PbO2 and BDD anodes in the mineralization of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (Fig. 3e and f). Additionally, previous work reported that Co3O4,93 IrO2,94 and Bi2O3 (ref. 85 and 95) are also excellent candidates for the EOD process, owing to their favourable electrochemical activities and good mechanical and chemical resistance.95

2.4. Carbon-based catalysts
Anode materials derived from carbon have also been extensively employed in the EOD process since these electrodes exhibit excellent chemical stability together with low resistivity. The widely reported carbon-based catalysts include BDD,21,100,101 graphite,20,102 activated carbon fibers,103 carbon nanotubes,104,105 and granular activated carbon.26,106 The catalytic performance of representative carbon-based anodes for HOP degradation is presented in Table 4. Among these carbon-based anodes, BDD is the most widely explored one due to its distinct advantages over other anodes, such as high corrosion resistance, favorable electrochemical stability, high OEP (2.8 V/SHE), a wide electrochemical potential window, and a low background current.107 Numerous studies suggest that many intrinsic properties of BDD anodes and electrochemical experimental conditions have a great impact on the degradation performance of BDD anodes.

BDD films are usually fabricated with the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, and a substrate is necessary to support the BDD film and improve its stability.108–110 The commonly used substrates include Si, Ta, Ti, Nb, and W, but it is difficult to evaluate the stability of BDD films as a function of the substrate type due to the non-uniform preparation parameters among different studies, as well as evident pros and cons of each substrate.108 Apart from the substrate, another intrinsic property that can heavily influence the electrocatalytic performance of BDD is the sp3 (diamond)/sp2 (graphite) carbon ratio.111–115 For example, six p-Si BDD anodes with different sp3/sp2 carbon ratios (165–323) showed various degradation capacities towards 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D).112 A more speedy and effective dechlorination of 2,4-D is due to a higher sp3 carbon content in the BDD anode. However, the sp3/sp2 ratio has no effect on the type of detected intermediate. On the other hand, Medeiros de Araújo and co-authors114 found that more aromatic intermediates are formed at the BDD6 anode (high sp3 carbon), while less of them are yielded when the BDD1 anode (high sp2 carbon) was used, in the mineralization of RhB. Their further exploration indicated that a higher content of sp3 carbon resulted in greater TOC and COD decomposition by electrochemical mineralization with hydroxyl radicals. In contrast, the BDD anode with a lower sp3/sp2 ratio favoured electrochemical conversion (formation of many intermediates) because of the strong adsorption of reactants on graphite carbon sites. In other words, sp2 carbon species behave as “active anode” parts, which mainly follow the direct oxidation process and lead to a lower RhB combustion ratio. More details about this aspect can be found in previous reviews.111,113
To further upgrade the electrochemical oxidation performance of planar/bare BDD anodes, surface modification is highly recommended.116,117 Nanocrystallization,118 chemical etching,119 electrochemical anodization,120,121 porous structuring,122,123 and hybridization116,123 are proved as efficient strategies to achieve better electrochemical performance of BDD electrodes. The general idea of these methods is to improve the active surface area, enhance the intrinsic electrochemical activity and boost the durability of electrodes.123 Urtiaga et al.118 employed an ultrananocrystalline boron doped conductive diamond electrode that possessed a thin film coating and nanoscale grain size to degrade PFOA (100 mg L−1). Several key experimental parameters were investigated systematically, including the supporting electrolyte, the applied current density and the hydrodynamic conditions. The results suggested that PFOA degradation and mineralization ratios were higher than 90% within 6 hours, at an applied current density of 200 A m−2. Currently, the applications of modified BDD in the mineralization of HOPs are rarely reported, and more attention should be encouraged to make better use of these great BDD electrodes.
In the EOD process, the supporting electrolyte has a conspicuous influence on the mineralization performance of BDD anodes. Specifically, the degradation kinetics and efficiency, as well as the degradation pathways are sensitive to electrolytes.124–126 The commonly used electrolytes include NaCl, Na2SO4, NaNO3, and NaHCO3. Among these, NaCl and NaSO4 are the most attractive ones since they can produce highly effective hydroxyl radicals, such as Cl˙, ClOx˙, SO4˙−, and S2O82−, which are beneficial to the decay of HOPs.127,128 Carneiro et al.125 compared the effect of five different electrolytes (Na2SO4, NaCl, Na2CO3, NaNO3, and Na3PO4) on the removal of enrofloxacin, using a BDD anode. Compared to the other electrolytes, NaCl led to an appreciably faster degradation of enrofloxacin, and most of the initial intermediates were chlorinated. Nevertheless, Na2SO4 manifested a better performance than NaCl in the electrooxidation of losartan with a BDD electrode.126 Using Na2SO4 as a supporting electrolyte, the mineralization ratio (67%) was higher than that of the NaCl system (56%). Interestingly, Mena et al.127 designed an experiment to clarify the contribution of hydroxyl radicals and electrogenerated sulfur-based radicals (e.g., peroxodisulfate) to the degradation of three different ionic liquids (ILs) using a BDD anode. Their results suggested that sulfate could improve the efficiency of the electrooxidation process and prevent the formation of polymers.
In addition, many studies underscore the importance of the water matrix on the EOD process with BDD anodes.129–131 Naturally, waters contain various organic and inorganic, non-target components. These constituents may interact with the oxidizing radicals and the target pollutants. As a result, the presence of these chemicals can heavily impact the performance of BDD anodes. The frequently investigated components include chloride, sulfates, carbonates, and humic acid. As aforementioned, chloride can introduce different active chlorine species that complement ˙OH in the mineralization of HOPs. However, a high concentration of Cl− can improve Cl2 evolution and hence, cause a reduction of the anode performance. What's worse, several organochlorinated components, such as chloramines and trihalomethanes, may be generated in the electrocatalysis process, which is detrimental to the degradation process owing to their high toxicity and strong recalcitrance.132,133 In contrast, radicals derived from sulfates act as good mediators and contribute to the indirect electrocatalysis of pollutants.129 Conversely, the presence of carbonates/bicarbonates can reduce the mineralization efficiency of BDD anodes, due to the fact that carbonates/bicarbonates are ˙OH scavengers, namely, carbonates/bicarbonates can consume ˙OH and reduce the availability of ˙OH to target HOPs.132 Humic acid (HA) is an analogue of natural organics typically detected in waters. HA has been recognized as a detrimental component in the degradation of HOPs for several reasons: (1) competition between HA and target HOPs for radicals, (2) HA is a radical scavenger and (3) binding reactions between HA and pollutants.132
Other than BDD, carbon nanotubes, activated carbon, and graphite have also been employed in the decay of HOPs. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) attract enormous attention due to their one-dimensional conduction pathways, chemical stability, good electrical conductivity and high surface area.104,134 Combined with graphene, the CNT-graphene composite electrode exhibited excellent performance in the mineralization of perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) owing to the synergy of electrochemical degradation and electrosorption (Fig. 4).135 Granular activated carbon (AC) often acts as a particulate electrode in the electrolysis system, which can enhance the overall active electrode area, conductivity, and mass transfer and improve the electrochemical degradation kinetics and COD removal ratio.136 Pedersen et al.137 explored the synergy of AC adsorption and electrochemical degradation in the mineralization of 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxy acetic acid (MCPA) and 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxy propionic acid (MCPP). Their results indicated that synergies of 121–126% were found for MCPA and MCPP at a w/w AC:organic ratio of 5:1, with an electric field strength of 375 V m−1. Recently, graphite has been employed as an anode for the mineralization of atrazine for the first time.20 The oxygen-containing functional groups produced by the positively polarized graphite electrode played a catalytic role. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis verified the presence of oxygen-containing functional groups (C–OH, COOH, and CO) on the graphite anode surface during the anodic oxidation (water oxidation) process. Surprisingly, no indicator for the production of abundant hydroxyl radicals at graphite electrodes was found, and atrazine was virtually degraded by the chemisorbed reactive oxygen.

Apart from electrochemical activity, the stability of electrocatalysts is another key property in practice. The deactivation of anodes is a common issue in the electrochemical oxidation process, especially the PbO2 and SnO2 based catalysts.33,37,39,68,70,78,90,144 There are many factors responsible for anodic deactivation, such as mechanical damage, detachment, consumption/dissolution, and passivation, as well as operating conditions (e.g., temperature, applied current), etc.70,145,146
To alleviate the deactivation and prolong the lifetime of catalysts, efficient strategies (e.g., doping and introducing an interlayer) which focus on optimizing the catalyst configuration have exhibited great potential.78 Recently, Yu et al.33 investigated the influence of Ce doping and the RuO2–SnO2–TiO2 interlayer on the stability of the PbO2 electrode through accelerated life tests. Three samples, namely PbO2-0 (unmodified PbO2/Ti), PbO2-1 (Ti/RuO2–SnO2–TiO2/PbO2), and PbO2-3 (Ti/RuO2–SnO2–TiO2/PbO2–CeO2, Ce/Pb = 0.01), exhibited completely different anti-deactivation abilities. The service lifetime of PbO2-3 was 215 h, which was 0.7 times longer than that of PbO2-1 (125 h) and 9.2 times longer than that of PbO2-0 (21 h). Consequently, both Ce doping and the existence of the RuO2–SnO2–TiO2 interlayer could notably improve the cataly’ts' durability. Other than the interlayer, Ce doping could conduce the formation of a compact surface layer, which also regulated the durability. The compact surface could effectively hinder the penetration of electrolytes into the Ti substrate and decrease the inner mechanical stress on PbO2, thus improving the durability. Many similar reports also emphasise the role of doping and the interlayer in the construction of robust anodes.144,147–149
2.5. Electrooxidative dehalogenation mechanisms
The successful cleavage of C–X bonds through electrochemical oxidation by catalysts is mainly derived from reactive species and/or electrons. Hence, the EOD process can be roughly divided into two categories, namely, direct anodic oxidation and indirect oxidation. It is worth noting that many degradation processes involve both pathways,38,65,150 and the direct oxidation reaction is a vital rate-limiting step for the degradation of pollutants that are unreactive with reactive oxygen species (e.g., fluorinated compounds).108
The direct anodic oxidation process occurs directly on the surface of anodes and involves direct electrons transfer between the HOPs and anode surface. Adsorption of organics onto anode surfaces is an important step in this process as it largely determines the degradation rate.151 Another important factor is the applied potential, and the wanted potential should be higher than that of the H2O oxidation reaction. Otherwise, the applied electrode is susceptible to surface poisoning which leads to a decreased degradation efficiency.152 Although direct anodic oxidation generally results in very poor degradation performance,153 there are a few studies that report favorable HOP abatement results.154,155
The indirect oxidation process is based on the reactive species (e.g., ˙OH, H2O2, O3, ˙Cl, Cl2, ClO−, SO4˙−, and S2O82−) that are produced on the surface of anodes. Among these reactive species, ˙OH is almost a defining requirement of the indirect oxidation process due to its high redox potential (2.80 V/SHE). In most circumstances, indirect electrooxidation degradation of HOPs can be explained with ˙OH. However, the degradation pathway depends heavily on the adsorption status of ˙OH on anode surfaces. On the one hand, the chemisorbed ˙OH on active anodes (e.g., Pt, RuO2, and IrO2) can react drastically with anodes and form higher oxides or superoxides. This strong interaction between anodes and ˙OH decreases the catalytic efficiency of reactive species and leads to the partial transformation of HOPs, called electrochemical conversion. On the other hand, the physisorbed ˙OH on inactive anodes (e.g., BDD, doped-SnO2, and PbO2) presents a weak interaction with inactive anodes and can result in complete electrochemical degradation, named electrochemical combustion. The classification of anodes mainly depends on the ˙OH production capacity, but not all electrodes can be clearly divided into the mentioned two types and some anodes manifest characteristics of both types.108 To present the mentioned degradation process more intuitively, schemes based on the model proposed by Comninellis156 are displayed in Fig. 5.
 Fig. 5  Mechanistic scheme of oxidative degradation of HOPs on inactive anodes (a) and on active anodes (b). 
Other radicals such as chlorine- and sulfur-based species also play important roles in the mineralization of HOPs. Active chlorine species generated from solution begins with the direct oxidation of chloride ions on the anode surface viaeqn (1), and the generated chlorine diffuses away from the electrode surface and yields Cl− and HClO through disproportionation (eqn (2)). 2Cl− → Cl2(aq) + 2e−(1) Cl2(aq) + H2O → HClO + Cl− + H+(2)
The HClO in acid–base is in equilibrium with ClO− with a pKa of 7.55 (eqn (3)).157 HClO ↔ ClO− + H+(3)
It should be pointed out that the existence of these oxidative species highly depends on the pH value (pH < 3, Cl2; pH = 3–8, HClO; pH > 8, ClO−). As a result, the oxidation of pollutants is more efficient in acidic media as the standard redox potentials of HClO (1.49 V/SHE) and Cl2 (1.36 V/SHE) are higher than that of ClO− (0.89 V/SHE).133 Furthermore, the conversion of HClO to ClO3− (eqn (4)) can interfere with the degradation performance as ClO3− is less active in the oxidation reaction.158 6HClO + 3H2O → 2ClO3− + 4Cl− + 12H+ + 1.5O2 + 6e−(4)
Likewise, chloride species can react with radicals and form perchlorates by eqn (5)–(8). Cl− + ˙OH → ClO− + H+ + e−(5) ClO− + ˙OH → ClO2− + H+ + e−(6) ClO2− + ˙OH → ClO3− + H+ + e−(7) ClO3− + ˙OH → ClO4− + H+ + e−(8)
Actually, the evolution of ClO4− is an undesirable process because of its low oxidation capacity and serious hazardousness to human health.133 Furthermore, those organo-chlorinated species formed are also detrimental to the mineralization process due to their strong persistence and high toxicity.108
S2O82− with a high redox potential (2.01 V/SHE) is another often mentioned radical because Na2SO4 is the most widely used electrolyte. The generation of S2O82− is presented with eqn (9).159 This radical has a strong oxidation potential and can react with organic pollutants, which results in a desirable degradation. Interestingly, the potential of persulfate can be greatly enhanced with different activation methods,160 and the related studies are reviewed by Matzek and Carter.161 SO4˙− is another sulfur-based radical, which also shows a high redox potential (2.5–3.1 V/SHE). The formation and transformation of sulfate radicals are presented in eqn (10)–(12).160 Previous reports indicated that both persulfate radicals and sulfate radicals could facilitate the mineralization of organic pollutants due to their high oxidation ability.160,162,163 2SO42− → S2O82− + 2e−(9) SO42− → SO4˙− + e−(10) SO4˙− + H2O → SO42− + ˙OH + H+(11) S2O82− + e− → SO42− + SO4˙−(12)
Other radicals (e.g., H2O2 and O3) are also quite important complements to ˙OH in the EOD process. More information can be found in previous reviews.133,164
It is necessary to place emphasis on the mineralization pathway of perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), due to the high persistence of C–F and the terrible toxicity of PFCs. In addition, it is suggested that the mineralization of PFCs cannot be solely explained by radicals (e.g., ˙OH), which is quite different from the degradation process of normal HOPs. Niu et al.165 found that the degradation of PFCAs began with a direct anodic oxidation process (eqn (13)), and the formed radicals (e.g., CnF2n+1˙) can react with ˙OH or other radicals. With a series of reactions (intramolecular rearrangement and hydrolysis), PFCAs can be totally mineralized by repeating the CF2-unzipping cycle, and the related reaction is presented in eqn (14)–(17). However, Li and co-authors suggested that the mineralization of PFOA (e.g., C7F15COOH) was primarily driven by ˙OH radicals (eqn (18)) in an MW-Fenton-like process.166 Indeed, mechanisms related to different PFCs and different degradation systems may vary significantly. More detailed information can be found in previous review works,28,167 and a classical PFCs degradation process is presented in Fig. 6.28 CnF2n+1COO− → CnF2n+1COO˙ + e−(13) CnF2n+1COO˙ → CnF2n+1˙ + CO2(14) CnF2n+1˙ + HO˙ → CnF2n+1OH(15) CnF2n+1OH → CnF2n−1OF + HF(16) CnF2n−1OF + H2O → Cn−1F2n−2COO− + HF + H+(17) C7F15COO− + HO˙ → C7F15COO˙ + OH−(18)

Therefore, due to the complexity of the HOP structure, radical species, and water matrix, the oxidation degradation pathway should be explored on a case-by-case basis with the assistance of advanced analysis methods.
3. Catalysts for electroreductive dehalogenation
The electrocatalytic reduction is a highly effective method for the degradation of HOPs. Different from the electrooxidation process that generally results in complete mineralization of HOPs, the overall goal of the electroreductive process is either total dehalogenation (principally hydrodehalogenation) of HOPs to remove further treatment, or transformation into value-added chemicals.30,168 In this part of the review, commonly reported catalysts such as Ag-based electrodes, Pd-based electrodes, and metal complexes (organometallic compounds) are analysed. Subsequently, diverse reduction mechanisms are reviewed to provide a better insight into the electrolytic scission of C–X bonds.
3.1. Ag-based catalysts
Recently, silver-based cathodes have attracted much attention owing to their strong electrocatalytic activities toward dehalogenation of HOPs. The high affinity of Ag for halide ions plays the vital role.169,170 Compared with the classic glassy carbon electrode which commonly acts as a noncatalytic cathode, the electrochemical breakage of C–X bonds at the silver cathode occurs at a much less negative potential.171 Several critical examples involving the ERD process with Ag-based cathodes are summarised in Table 5.

Nanosizing is an effective strategy to enhance the performance of Ag cathodes as well as to reduce the consumption of this precious metal.172,177 Ag nanoparticles present distinctive capabilities that are different from the bulk material because of their decreased dimensions and improved surface to volume ratios.178 For instance, Sui and co-workers172 fabricated an Ag-ZSM-5/SS zeolite modified electrode with a facile one-step method, and Ag nanoparticles (average diameter of 9 nm) were formed in situ with ZSM-5 films grown on the stainless steel. The addition of well-dispersed Ag nanoparticles highly elevated the conductivity of the zeolite film, with a low resistance of 4 mΩ sq−1. Further study suggested that the electrochemically active surface areas played a key role in determining the catalytic performance. Compared to the Ag bulk electrode, ZSM-5 provided more sites for dispersing and stabilizing Ag nanoparticles and promoted Ag nanoparticles' catalytic activity. As a result, Ag-ZSM-5/SS displayed marvelous electrocatalytic activities towards electrocarboxylation of PhCH2Cl, and an electrocarboxylation yield of 61% was obtained at −1.1 V. However, the application of the Ag bulk electrode showed a lower yield of 40% at a more negative potential of −1.5 V. Brzózka et al.178 systematically designed three Ag electrodes, namely, the silver nanohemisphere (Ag-NHS) electrode, nanowire (Ag-NW) array electrode and silver rod (Ag-bulk) electrode, and the detailed synthesis routes of the Ag-NHS electrode and Ag-NW electrode are presented in Fig. 7a. The as-prepared two nanomaterials exhibited quite different morphologies and diameters. Ag-NHSs possessed an average diameter of 126 nm and a height of 126 nm, while the diameter and length of Ag-NWs were 90 nm and 3.5 μm (Fig. 7b–d). The smaller size of Ag-NWs could provide more active sites for the electrochemical reaction. Compared with the Ag-bulk electrode, both Ag-NHS and Ag-NW electrodes manifested better electrochemical performance and stability in the degradation of CHCl3. Furthermore, the Ag-NW electrode showed about 200 mV less over potential than the Ag-bulk electrode, while that of the Ag-NHS electrode was about 100 mV.

Another encouraging way to boost the electrocatalytic activity of Ag cathodes is based on changing Ag bulk to multi-metallic electrodes.179,180 Vanrenterghem et al.179 prepared bimetallic Ag–Ni glassy carbon supported cathodes (Ag–Ni/GC) with a two-step procedure, and the designed Ag–Ni/GC electrodes were compared with Ag/Ni foam electrodes for the reduction of benzyl bromide. Their results suggested that pretreatment such as cathodising in alkali and scanning in acid had an obvious effect on the surface composition of Ag–Ni/GC cathodes, with the cathodising and scanning processes leading to a higher atomic ratio of Ag–Ni of 1/13 and 1/4, respectively, in comparison with the 1/17 for the non-treated one. Further study indicated that the Ag–Ni/GC electrode cathodised in alkali was the best one for the degradation of benzyl bromide, and the yield of the sole product toluene (49 mol%) was higher than that of the bulk Ag cathode (37 mol%). Hence, the presence of Ni has a beneficial influence on the electrocatalytic capacity of Ag.

Table 5 also reveals that the degradation performance of Ag-based cathodes relies heavily on HOP structures, apart from the intrinsic properties of electrodes. In particular, the molecular structures of HOPs have a significant impact on the dissociative electron transfer (DET) process in the dehalogenation reaction. For example, electroreduction of a series of aliphatic and aromatic bromides on the silver cathode has been studied by cyclic voltammetry in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([BMIm]BF4).170 In the case of aromatic bromides, the electron transfer process supplies a radical anion intermediate that further dissociates to R˙ and Br−, and this reaction is called a stepwise mechanism. It is worth noting that the electrocatalytic activity for aromatic bromides relies highly on the molecular structure of RBr, decreasing with growing ability of RBr to delocalize the negative charge in the radical anion intermediate. However, for the reduction of different aliphatic bromides, Ag always displays a great electrocatalytic activity, which has been confirmed by several studies.181–183
3.2. Pd-based catalysts
Noble metal catalysts (e.g., Pd, Ru, Rh, and Pt) that show great electrocatalytic activities have also been applied to the electrochemical dehalogenation of HOPs. Among these, Pd is the most frequently used cathode as it possesses an extraordinary ability to intercalate hydrogen within its lattice.184 Moreover, the formed active chemical species Pd–H normally acts as the source of atomic hydrogen (H*).1,185 Quite different from the dissociative electron transfer (DET) process with Ag-based catalysts, the electrocatalytic hydrodehalogenation (ECH) process using atomic hydrogen is the main HOP degradation pathway with Pd-based electrodes. Therefore, enormous efforts have been devoted to the development of high-performance Pd-based cathodes that can produce sufficient H* and have a long lifetime. A summary of representative HOP electroreductive dehalogenation studies with Pd-based cathodes is presented in Table 6.

The nature of Pd cathode materials plays a critical role in the dehalogenation process, as well as some key parameters, including fabrication methods, interlayers, and substrates. Among these, the fabrication methods and interlayers are emphasized in this work, as well as the coupling strategy. The fabrication method plays a vital role in determining the catalytic performance of electrodes. He and co-workers193 fabricated Pd-based electrodes by pulsed electrodeposition (PE-Pd/foam-Ni) and traditional chemical deposition (CD-Pd/foam-Ni). Compared with the latter one, PE-Pd/foam-Ni possesses upgraded dechlorination efficiency and current efficiency for the degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). The reason was that PE-Pd/foam-Ni possessed a smaller particle size and a higher percentage of exposed (111) facets together with a higher number of edge/corner sites than that of CD-Pd/foam-Ni. These characteristics favored the production and stabilization of chemisorbed H*. Furthermore, to exploit the most intrinsic properties of Pd catalysts, a robust interlayer with a high specific surface area is often required.189,190 For instance, Li et al.186 found that the conductive polymer polyaniline (PANI) in the Pd/PANI/Ni electrode existed in the shape of needles, and Pd0 clusters dispersed quite well in the network on PANI. The Pd/PANI/Ni electrode exhibited a higher specific surface area (6.8 m2 g−1) than Pd/Ni electrode, which resulted in a better removal efficiency for 2,4-dichlorophenol than the latter one (89.1% vs. 71.1%). Moreover, Lou and coworkers187 examined the role of MnO2 in a Pd/MnO2/Ni foam electrode, and they found that the introduction of MnO2 could drastically decrease the consumption of Pd by four times while achieving complete removal of 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid (Fig. 8a). Surprisingly, MnO2 could promote water dissociation and provide more atomic H* for dechlorination, which is the main reason for the electrochemical dehalogenation improvement of the Pd/MnO2/Ni foam electrode (Fig. 8b). Coupling with other metal(s) is another way to decrease the dosage of Pd and boost its electrocatalytic properties. The synergistic effect of metals can upgrade the activity and selectivity of catalysts and relieve catalyst aging and loss.197,198 For example, Wu and co-workers198 developed a palladium–nickel/multi-walled carbon nanotubes/graphite felt electrode (Pd–Ni/MWCNTs/GF) for the electrocatalytic hydrodechlorination of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP). Experimental results suggested that the interaction between Pd and Ni was beneficial for Pd reinforcement, thus improving the stability of electrodes. Compared to those cathodes with single-metal Pd, Pd–Ni/ MWCNTs/GF demonstrated better stability and higher reactivity for the degradation process, with complete removal of 4-CP being achieved in 30 min.

Experimental parameters (e.g., pH value, applied current, and electrolyte) also impact the performance of cathodes heavily.185,198,199 Take the cathode potential as an example, Jiang et al.199 found that the applied potential had a great influence on the evolution of three different hydrogen species, namely adsorbed atomic hydrogen , absorbed atomic hydrogen , and molecular hydrogen (H2). Combined with the degradation efficiency and kinetics of 2,4-dichlorophenol (Fig. 9), they confirmed that  is the active species and  is inert, while H2 bubbles are detrimental to the electrocatalytic hydrodechlorination reaction. Consequently, to achieve the desired degradation result, a moderate potential is needed to produce sufficient  and limit the negative effect of H2.

3.3. Metal complex-based catalysts
In recent years, electrogenerated low-valent metal complexes, known as mediator catalysts, have attracted immense attention in the catalytic reduction of HOPs. These metal complexes are generated at a more positive potential than that needed for the direct breakage of C–X bonds. Surprisingly, these electrogenerated catalysts possess great catalytic activities, preparative accessibility, and structural flexibility.2,200 To date, nickel together with cobalt species is the most prominent catalyst for the reduction of HOPs, and Table 7 summarises the catalytic performance of representative metal complexes.

Nickel(I) salen, usually electrogenerated at glass carbon cathodes in either acetonitrile or dimethylformamide, has presented an excellent catalytic activity towards the reduction of different HOPs, including 1,6-dihalohexanes, 1-bromodecane, 1-iododecane, α,ω-dihaloalkanes, 6-bromo-1-hexene, haloalkynes, cyclohexyl bromide, cyclohexyl iodide, etc.201,202 For example, Wagoner and co-workers203 examined the catalytic reduction of 1,2,5,6,9,10-hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) with nickel(I) salen in dimethylformamide. The bulk electrolysis of less than 20.0 mM HBCD proceeded via a six-electron process, which resulted in the conversion of the initial pollutant to 1,5,9-cyclododecatriene (88–95%), with small amounts of cyclododeca-1,5-dien-9-yne (3–4%). In addition, it is worth noting that nickel(I) salen-catalyzed reduction of alkyl halides often leads to alkylation of one or both imino (CN) bonds, which seriously impedes the dehalogenation process.2,202 Under such circumstances, structurally modified nickel(I) salen species have exhibited a better performance, mainly due to the fact that they possess a methyl protecting group on imino (CN) bonds.201,204
Cobalt complexes such as cobalt(I) alamin (vitamin B12), cobalt(I) salen, cobalt(I) polypyridyl, and cobalt(I) phthalocyanine complexes have displayed great catalytic performance toward the reduction of organohalides.2,30 Among these complexes, vitamin B12 which consists of a cobalt atom coordinated by four nitrogen atoms of the corrin ring is extensively explored. Its derivatives have been widely investigated due to their extensive application in synthesis, bioremediation, biocatalysis, and electrocatalysis, especially in the electrocatalytic reduction process of organic halides.205–207 As is reported, vitamin B12 species are able to reduce arenes, ethanes, ethylenes, higher alkanes, chlorinated methanes, etc.30,206,207 More in-depth information related to the vitamin B12 dehalogenation performance can be found in a recent review.206 Similar to nickel(I) salen, cobalt(I) salen is another extensively discussed catalyst in the scission of C–X bonds. In a typical study, 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane (CFC-113a) was reduced by electrogenerated cobalt(I) salen at a glassy carbon cathode. Surprisingly, CFC-113a (10.0 mM) has been successfully converted, with main product distributions of 2,2-dichloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane (52%), 2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane and 2-chloro-1,1-difluoroethene (7%), and 1,1-difluoroethene (1%). In addition, the salen ligand of cobalt(I) salen was modified through the addition of a CF3CCl2- or CF3CHCl-moiety to the CN bond in the catalytic reduction process.208
3.4. Electroreductive dehalogenation mechanisms
The mechanisms of the electroreductive scission of C–X bonds have been broadly investigated, are still discussed in many authoritative studies,1,2,168 and are also outlined in this work briefly.
Firstly, the heterogeneous and homogeneous electron transfer (ET) plays an important role in the reduction process.168 The extensively researched dissociative electron transfer (DET) theory can account for vast experimental results when Ag-based cathodes are applied, and a scheme mechanism of DET is provided in Fig. 10a.212 Scheme a is a stepwise mechanism, involving the formation of an intermediate radical anion (RX˙−) before the cleavage of the C–X bond, while scheme b, named concerted mechanism, represents the simultaneous electron transfer and the C–X bond breaking. Literature data suggest that degradation of aromatic halides mainly follows the stepwise mechanism, whereas aliphatic halides prefer the concerted one,1,170 but there are several exceptions to this rule.212 Hence, it is necessary to carry out careful exploration of the reaction system before assigning one or another mechanism to a typical degradation process. Additionally, scheme c is a variant of the concerted mechanism referred to as sticky DET, and two fragments (e.g., R˙ and X−) can induce ion–dipole interactions in the solvent cage before they diffuse apart in this procedure. Generally, many subsequent reactions will occur and produce dimers and hydrodehalogenated species (eqn (19)–(23)), and SH is the solvent.2,168 R˙ + e− → R−(19) R˙ + SH → RH + S˙(20) R− + SH → RH + S−(21) R− + RX → R − R + X−(22) R˙ + R˙ → R − R(23)

Secondly, when electrogenerated low-valent metal complexes are employed as catalysts, the ET process will occur under homogeneous conditions.168 In a representative work, Chan and co-workers213 discussed the use of cobalt porphyrin to catalyze the hydrodehalogenation of aryl bromides, and the plausible mechanism is illustrated in Fig. 10b. Initially, CoII(ttp) abstracts a bromine atom from ArBr to generate CoIII(ttp)Br and Ar˙. Then, Ar˙ abstracts an H from the solvent to form ArH, while CoIII(ttp)Br undergoes ligand substitution with KOH and generates CoIII(ttp)OH and KBr. Afterwards, CoIII(ttp)OH produces H2O2 and regenerates CoII(ttp) by reductive elimination. Subsequently, H2O2 was catalyzed by CoII(ttp) or base to H2O and O2.
Finally, the indirect dehalogenation process with  is another efficient way to degrade HOPs,168 and this mechanism is often associated with the application of Pd-based catalysts. The reductive dehalogenation process is known as electrocatalytic hydrogenolysis (ECH),214,215 which can be described as chemisorbed hydrogen atoms being first generated on the cathode surface by electrolysis of water and then reacting with adsorbed HOPs. The key steps are listed in eqn (24)–(29).193,214,216 2H2O(2H3O+) + 2e− + 2M → 2(H)adsM + 2OH−(2H2O) (Volmer step)(24) R − X + M → (R − X)adsM(25) (R − X)adsM + 2(H)adsM → (R − H)adsM + 2M + HX(26) (R − H)adsM → R − H + M(27) (H)adsM + H2O + e− → H2 + OH− + M (Heyrovsky step)(28) (H)adsM + (H)adsM → H2 + 2M (Tafel step)(29)where M represents the metallic surface, and HX denotes HOPs. Actually, the ECH process is just a combination of eqn (21)–(24), whereas the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) (eqn (25) and (26)) occurs as the competition process. Hence, it is of great importance to depress the HER in the degradation process.
The HER process starts with the formation of  and then the electrochemical desorption (Volmer-Heyrovsky), or the recombination of the atomic  (Volmer–Tafel).217–219 Both the HER and ECH process require abundant surface adsorbed hydrogen atoms through the Volmer step, so the key to suppress the HER process is to block the Heyrovsky step or the Tafel step. Currently, two strategies are often applied to optimize the degradation process through effectively eliminating the HER process. The first strategy is using cathode materials with a favorable ability to generate and retain . In this regard, Pd distinguishes itself not only for its high efficiency in taking up protons to generate H* but also due to its ability to retain H* by adsorption onto the Pd surface  and absorption to the Pd atoms via the formation of a Pd hydride .220 Therefore, Pd can maintain a high surface hydrogen concentration for the ECH process. In most of the cases, it is difficult for other materials (e.g., Pt and Rh) to retain the generated , since the  are easily transform to molecular hydrogen through the Heyrovsky step or the Tafel step. Recently, several effective methods have been applied to further enhance the selectivity of Pd.190,220 For example, Liu and co-workers220 found that the defective sits in Pd nanowires could enhance the stability of the generated  and suppress the HER process. Due to the magnificent  generation/provision capacity, the defect-rich Pd nanowires exhibited a higher 2,4-dichlorophenol removal efficiency with a six-fold-lower Pd loading than the unmodified Pd materials. Another strategy to eliminate the HER process is to optimize the operating parameters, such as the cathode potential,185,199,221,222 pH value,223 and dissolved oxygen.217 Among these factors, the cathode potential is the most frequently studied. Commonly, the kinetics of  production are modulated by the cathode potential, and a more negative potential will usually hasten  generation, which could offer sufficient  for enhanced ECH.221 However, as a side reaction,  may evolve into H2 through the Heyrovsky step or the Tafel step at a more reductive potential. Such a side reaction can compete with ECH in  utilization, and the generated hydrogen bubbles also interfere with the mass transfer of H+ and HOPs to the cathode surface, resulting in a decrease in ECH efficiency.199 As a result, an optimal cathode potential is critical for the restraint of the HER.
However, it should be noted that there is still a lack of fundamental principles for interpreting the dehalogenation mechanism of a typical HOP without experimental examination due to that fact that there are many unexpected observations related to the mechanisms mentioned above.187,195,197,212,215 For instance, Liu et al.197 found that atomic  formation function and the electron transfer process both existed in the trichloroacetic acid (TCAA) removal process, while the enhanced indirect atomic  reduction process played a principal role in the degradation process (Fig. 11).

4. Integrated technologies
Recently, the number of strategies has grown rapidly with the development of coupling synergistic processes based on the combination of electrocatalysis.224 The coupling can upgrade the overall degradation performance toward HOPs due to the synergy between different sophisticated processes.224,225 The Fenton reaction,87,226 membrane filtration,227,228 biological treatment,225,229 photocatalysis,230,231 ozonation,225,232 adsorption,225,233 ultrasound,230,234 UV irradiation,230,235 microwave,236 and thermolysis237,238 are the widely reported methods that can improve the electrochemical activity of electrocatalysis. In this part of the review, the first four methods are detailed due to their wide applications. A list of representative HOP dehalogenation with synergistic methods is shown in Table 8.

The electro-Fenton (EF) process, namely the combination of electrochemical oxidation (EO) with the Fenton process, usually electrogenerates Fenton's reagents (i.e., ferrous ion and hydrogen peroxide) in situ.244,245 Compared with the traditional Fenton process, EF consumes fewer reagents and thus produces less iron sludge. Additionally, the EF process often exhibits higher activity than EO for the mineralization of HOPs. For example, Bedolla-Guzman and co-workers241 employed both EO and EF to treat the reactive yellow HF dye, and they found that the ˙OH generated by the EF process more rapidly removed the organic pollutants than those in EO. An interesting chapter by Oturan, N. and Oturan, M. A. keeps a close eye on important parameters of the EF process, including principles, operational parameters, application, heterogeneous EF, and bioelectro-EF, which may benefit researchers in this field.245
Photocatalysis is another effective approach to eliminate pollutants from wastewater.246 In the last few years, photocatalysis has been shown to enhance the degradation efficiency of electrocatalysis.231,247–249 Generally, the following points can explain the synergistic effect. On the one hand, the external bias leads to a decline in the electron–hole recombination process and the UV-photons reaching the electrode surface form excited radicals. On the other hand, photo irradiation can activate the electrochemically generated reactive radicals and overcome the mass-transport limitation.249 To mineralize norfloxacin in wastewater, da Silva and co-authors231 found that ultraviolet radiation could significantly improve the degradation performance of electrochemical oxidation. The coupling strategy possessed a higher TOC abatement (76%) than the direct photolysis (60%) and the electrochemical oxidation process (26%) in 360 min. In-depth analysis suggested that the increase in mineralization could be explained by a decrease in the electron–hole recombination on the TiO2 phase of the electrode, thus improving the generation of hydroxyl radicals.
In the traditional flow-by EO process, the diffusion of HOPs to the reaction zone is quite difficult, which results in a low mass transfer rate constant.227 To overcome this mass transfer limitation, combining membrane filtration with the EO process in the flow-through mode is an efficient method for HOP mineralization. In this process, water moves through the pores on the designed electrode materials, which can minimize the thickness of the boundary layer, thus significantly upgrading the mass transfer rate of HOPs moving towards the electrode surface.226,227,239 In a recent work, tubular porous Ti/SnO2–Sb filters which possessed excellent electrochemical activity and penetration flux were used as anodic reactive electrochemical membranes in a reactive electrochemical filter system.227 The developed reactive electrochemical filter system in the flow-through mode resulted in a higher RhB oxidation efficiency than the flow-by mode by 8.6-fold under the same operational conditions.
Bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) based on the integration of the biological process and the electrochemical method have attracted increasing attention in the HOP degradation process because the BES process possesses high degradation efficiency, low operational cost, environmental sustainability, high selectivity, ambient operating conditions and reusable effluents.242,250 In a typical study, a coupled microbial electrosynthesis-upflow anaerobic sludge reactor (MES-UASB) was established to mineralize 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene,229 and the experimental results indicated that the coupled MES-UASB reactor obtained a high dechlorination efficiency (100%) at −660 mV in 12 h. More information involving this topic can be found in pervious reviews and chapters.250–253
5. Conclusions and prospects
In this work, the recent development in electrocatalysts for the degradation of HOPs in terms of the strategies for promoting the catalyst activities is comprehensively reviewed. It can be concluded that both electrooxidation and electroreduction are effective strategies to mineralize HOPs, with the application of adequate catalysts.
In the electrooxidative process, metal oxides (e.g., PbO2 and SnO2) and BDD are extensively applied as anodes due to their high performance in the production of ˙OH which is the main reactive radical in the oxidation degradation pathway. Additionally, nanostructuring, compositing, doping, and surface modification are extensively used strategies to upgrade the ability of these catalysts. Notably, the oxidation mechanisms that involve ˙OH rely heavily on the properties of catalysts. For the active anodes (e.g., Pt, RuO2, and IrO2), the degradation process often leads to electrochemical conversion, while the inactive anodes (e.g., BDD, doped-SnO2, and PbO2) commonly result in electrochemical combustion.
In the electroreductive process, metals (e.g., Ag and Pd) and low-valent metal complexes are responsible for the reduction of HOPs through the generated ˙H and electrons. To obtain a better degradation performance, many sound methods such as nanosizing, structure design, alloying, and component modification are extensively introduced. The reduction principles are closely related to the type of catalyst. The dissociative electron transfer (DET) theory can account for vast experimental phenomena when Ag-based cathodes are used. The homogeneous ET process will occur when electrogenerated low-valent metal complexes are employed as catalysts. In addition, the application of Pd-based catalysts is an indirect dehalogenation process, with  acting as the main active radical.
Identifying the structure–performance relationship of materials is crucial to the design of desirable electrocatalysts. For the electrochemical dehalogenation process, both activity and stability of catalysts need to be considered carefully. As aforementioned, nanostructuring, compositing, component regulation (doping and alloying), inserting an interlayer, and surface modification have shown great potential in designing robust and highly active electrocatalysts. Nanostructuring catalysts with well-dispersed active components that exhibit a high active surface area can provide more sites for the degradation reaction. Compositing also leads to a high specific surface area; specially, when a conductive substrate is involved, the conductivity and mass transfer process can be significantly elevated, thus accelerating the degradation process. Component regulation, such as doping and alloying, usually results in more abundant active components on catalyst surfaces, thereby benefitting the generation of more active radicals for the decomposition reaction. In addition, the optimal components possess a decent interaction strength with radicals (e.g., H* and ˙OH), and diminish the side reactions (e.g., oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions). Introduction of an interlayer and surface modification have a significant impact on the lifetime of electrocatalysts by hindering the penetration of electrolytes, decreasing the inner mechanical stress, and preventing the catalyst damage (e.g., detachment, consumption, and dissolution). Other strategies that are mentioned above also benefit the durability of catalysts.
However, more innovative catalysts and technological methods are still highly desired for the further development of the electrocatalytic dehalogenation process due to some critical limitations/challenges related to the practical application of the current electrocatalytic dehalogenation treatment.1,28,254 Firstly, electricity is required continuously to support the electrochemical degradation process, and the electrical efficiency should be checked when evaluating the applicability of the electrocatalysis techniques. To decrease the energy cost, integrating electrocatalysis with other renewable energy techniques (e.g., solar photovoltaic power) and optimizing the operational parameters are highly advisable. Another interesting factor is the wastewater conductivity, which can be enhanced through the addition of seawater and inorganic salts (e.g., Na2SO4, phosphate buffer, and Na2CO3). Secondly, the released toxic ions (e.g., Pb2+) of electrodes may decrease the durability of electrodes and pose toxicity toward organisms, while the fouling and corrosion of electrodes (e.g., BDD) may also lead to an unstable degradation efficiency. These factors could hinder the industrial applications of the electrocatalytic degradation method. As a result, robust and highly active electrodes are extremely needed. Thirdly, the formation of toxic by-products in the degradation of HOPs, especially halogen-based compounds (e.g., BrO3−, ClO3−, and ClO4−), can limit the adoption of the electrochemical mineralization techniques. To control the generation of these products, optimal operational strategies and efficient electrode modifications are necessary. Currently, electrocatalysis has been extensively studied in the mineralization of pollutants beyond HOPs, while the degradation of real wastewater is still limited. Consequently, it is of great significance to explore the potential application of the electrochemical method in degrading complex pollutants in industrial wastewater. As indicated, the controllable electroreduction of organic pollutants can lead to the transformation of pollutants into value-added chemicals, for example the generation of n-hexane from the degradation of 1,2-dibromohexane. Accordingly, the electrochemical method is a promising approach to generate valuable chemicals with specific functional groups. In summary, a combination of hybrid technologies, ideal operating conditions, and electrode modifications needs to be explored to address these crucial challenges.
Several prospects are listed below for the purpose of upgrading existing electrochemical degradation techniques.
Developing high-performance catalysts is of great importance and many strategies including doping, nanostructuring, facet engineering, hybrid engineering, defect engineering, and alloying are efficient ways to improve the activity of catalysts. Furthermore, the structure–performance relationship should be taken seriously with the help of computational methods, and high-throughput screening is also vital to select typical catalysts for a determined pollutant. Another factor that should be taken into consideration is the cost. More efforts should be devoted to using low-cost materials (e.g., non-precious metals and graphite-based materials) and simple fabrication methods to obtain cost-effective electrodes.
To maximize the performance of electrocatalysts, it is necessary to optimize the experimental parameters in the degradation process. Normally, a reactor/system with a high electrode area to volume ratio, a low cell voltage, and a high mass transport rate is desired.2 As discussed aforementioned, the role of current, voltage, pH, electrolyte, and concentration of HOPs is also vital to the activity of catalysts, as well as the degradation pathway. Hence, systematic investigations should be conducted to achieve better mineralization efficiency.
Advancing the scientific understanding of the dehalogenation/electrochemical process is still a key challenge, and the mechanism should be investigated case by case with experimental and theoretical methods, especially those operando characterization techniques. The applications of advanced in situ characterization techniques have benefited a lot for exploring the active sites on electrocatalysts for various reactions.255 For instance, the advanced scanning electrochemical microscopy technique can offer spatially resolved details of electrode reactivity at the micron to submicron scale, which is highly beneficial for characterizing the performance of catalysts and identifying the mechanisms involved in HOP transformation.108 This process could also lead to the design of more favorable catalysts. Additionally, a theoretical study based on density functional theory can provide critical information to understand the interaction between catalysts/radicals and pollutants, thus leading to a better understanding of the degradation/mineralization process.220,256,257
Taking advantage of other useful processes for HOP degradation, coupling electrocatalysis with those sophisticated methods will significantly upgrade the degradation performance. On the one hand, to achieve better degradation efficiencies, integrating those verified effective techniques such as membrane techniques, biological methods, Fenton processes, and photocatalysis with electrocatalysis is a promising solution. On the other hand, to decrease the operational cost, mainly the electricity utilization, it is advisable to investigate the combination of the electrochemical degradation process with renewable energy (e.g., solar photovoltaic power, wave power, wind energy, and geothermal energy) in future research.

Environmental significance
Electrocatalysis is an efficient approach for the degradation of halogenated organic pollutants. Currently, both electrooxidative and electroreductive dehalogenation processes are widely applied, and the key challenge lies in the development of high-performance electrocatalysts. Given the rapid advances in the design and development of efficient catalysts towards electrochemical dehalogenation, this review aims to summarise recent progress in popular electrocatalysts and theoretical understanding of dehalogenation processes. Additionally, several key prospects in this field are presented. This critical review can facilitate the design and application of next-generation electrocatalysts with ameliorated performances.
