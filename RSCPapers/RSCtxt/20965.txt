    , Accepted 30th October 2013First published on 30th October 2013AbstractLanthanum phosphate LaPO4 nanocrystals doped with Yb3+, Tb3+ and Eu3+ ions, were synthesised by a hydrothermal method followed by annealing at 900 °C. These materials exhibited bright and tunable up-conversion luminescence from green to red colour as the result of Tb3+ and Eu3+ ions emission. The structural and morphological properties of the products were analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The spectroscopic properties of LaPO4:Yb3+,Tb3+,Eu3+ nanocrystals were investigated using excitation and emission spectra. Also the luminescence decays were measured showing an unusually long rise time of the luminescence as a result of cooperative energy transfer mechanisms (CET) followed by energy migration. Calculated energy transfer rates and efficiencies showed the effectiveness of energy transfer between Yb3+, Tb3+ and Eu3+ ions.
1. Introduction
In the past decade, nanomaterials that contain lanthanide ions (Ln3+) as dopants have gained considerable attention because of their spectroscopic properties, which result from their f–f electronic transitions.1–4 These unique properties have been utilized in many fields, including materials science and the production of efficient phosphors, lasers, solar cells and security markers.2,4–8 In the life sciences, such as biology and medicine, these materials are especially intensively investigated.1,9–13 Applications such as bio-imaging and photodynamic therapy have been developed to take advantage of the luminescence of Ln3+ ions.14,15
Up-conversion emission (UC), which is the main property of described in this article materials, is a process that usually results in the conversion of near-infrared (NIR) radiation to visible light.1 This process is especially effective in Ln3+-doped inorganic materials. The most efficient systems are based on the energy transfer between Yb3+ and Er3+, Tm3+ or Ho3+, in which the energy transfer up-conversion mechanism (ETU) is involved.16 The up-conversion in other systems that contain Ln3+ has been developed with limited success. A large gap between the ground state and the first excited state in some Ln3+ emitters requires the cooperative energy transfer (CET) mechanism; examples are the Yb3+/Eu3+ and Yb3+/Tb3+ systems, which have no intermediate levels that are resonant with Yb3+.17,18 In this process, two Yb3+ ions that are excited by NIR radiation simultaneously combine and transfer their energies to one Ln3+, approaching the necessary energy for its excitation. UC of Eu3+ ions in the Yb3+/Eu3+ system is rare and ineffective because of the connection between their optical properties and the CET emission mechanism. In the Yb3+/Eu3+ system, the reversed process, down-conversion, can be more efficient, resulting in an energy transfer from Eu3+ to Yb3+ ions and the emission of near-infrared wavelengths.19
There are many explanations why the Eu3+ up-conversion is worth to be studied. First of all, systems: Yb3+/Eu3+ as well as Yb3+/Tb3+/Eu3+ are not sufficiently studied what gives an opportunity to find new information about these systems and generally about up-conversion mechanisms. UC of Eu3+ ions can be a good alternative for red emitting, Er3+-based systems or at least can give additional possibilities like longer luminescence lifetime. Emission in the red spectral region is especially good for biological applications because of transparency of water for red wavelengths.20 Long luminescence lifetimes of Eu3+ ions being the result of Eu3+ spectroscopic properties and used Yb3+ → Tb3+ → Eu3+ energy transfer, can be interesting for bioimaging and other related methods requiring lifetimes longer than autofluorescence of the background.12 Eu3+ ions are attractive as emitters because of high efficiency of emission related to the large energy gap between the emitting state and the low lying 7FJ excited states and resistance against quenching (as well as Tb3+ ions).21 What is more, the Eu3+ ion can be used as an optical structural probe to study the incorporation of the Ln3+ ions in the nanocrystalline hosts. Also red solid state lasers based on UC can be area for which UC of Eu3+ can be interesting.22
In a previous study, we developed an efficient Yb3+/Tb3+ up-converting system based on CET that uses GdPO4 as a host material.18 The first excited state of the Tb3+ ion, 5D4, has a similar energy to the 5D0 level of Eu3+ ions. Therefore, energy from the Tb3+ can be transferred to the Eu3+ ions, which has been exploited in UV-excited luminescent materials.23,24 The Tb3+ ions play the role of a bridge through which the excitation energy is transferred from the Yb3+ activator ions to the Eu3+ acceptor ions. What is more, this system allowed to achieve colour-tunable emission by controlling the amount of Eu3+ in the sample.
Multicolour and tunable UC exhibits properties that are desirable in novel materials and have been previously obtained, in most cases, by utilizing properties of Er3+ ions or by changing the concentration ratio of Er3+ and Tm3+, which emit in different spectral regions.25,26 The Er3+ ion is known for its sensitivity to the local environment, and its emission can change from green to red depending on the Er3+ site symmetry.26 The colour of Er3+ UC may be changed by manipulation of the concentration of Yb3+ ions, which increases back energy transfer processes and suppresses the population of the green-emitting level of the Er3+ ion.27 However, to my knowledge, no system based on energy transfer from Yb3+ through Tb3+ to Eu3+ ions is yet known.
Here, I present the up-conversion properties of nanocrystalline Eu3+-doped LaPO4 enhanced by energy transfer migration from Yb3+ sensitizers through Tb3+ with colour-tunable emission.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
The following reagents were used for the synthesis of the nanomaterials: La2O3, Yb2O3, Eu2O3 and Tb4O7 from Stanford Materials (99.999%), nitric acid HNO3 from POCh S.A. (ultra-pure), ammonium phosphate monobasic (NH4)H2PO4 from Sigma-Aldrich (ReagentPlus®, ≥98.5%), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) from Sigma-Aldrich (ACS Reagent, ≥99.4%) and ammonium hydroxide solution from Chempur (pure p.a., 25%). The rare-earth oxides were dissolved in HNO3 to obtain their respective nitrates. The resultant 1 M solutions were used for further synthesis.
2.2. Synthesis
The lanthanum phosphate nanocrystals, which were doped with Yb3+, Tb3+ and Eu3+ ions, were prepared using a two-step method. First, a hydrothermal method was used to synthesize doped hexagonal phosphates, LaPO4·0.5H2O, which had a rhabdophane structure. Next, the prepared nanorods were annealed at 900 °C to transform them into monoclinic nanocrystals. The procedure for obtaining the nanocrystals in the first stage was as follows: The reaction to synthesize 4 mmol of precipitate was carried out in the presence of 4 mmol of EDTA in distilled water. First, 10 mL of distilled water was added to 4 mmol of EDTA in the beaker, and the mixture was magnetically stirred. Next, the ammonium hydroxide solution was added until the pH reached 6 and the solution became transparent. Next were added the solutions of La(NO3)3, Yb(NO3)3, Tb(NO3)3 and Eu(NO3)3, and the pH was again adjusted to 6. After reaching the required pH, the (NH4)H2PO4 solution was added dropwise through a funnel over a period of 15 min and with magnetic stirring. The pH of reaction was maintained at 6 by adding diluted ammonium hydroxide solution, and after adding all the (NH4)H2PO4, water was added to reach a total volume of 75 mL. The resultant transparent solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave and hydrothermally treated with microwave heating for 3 h, reaching conditions of 180 °C and 38 bars. After reaction, the resultant white precipitate was centrifuged and washed several times with water and ethanol. In the second step, the powders were dried for 24 h at 80 °C in air and annealed at 900 °C for 2 hours. The temperature was chosen based on literature reports and our previous studies.18,28
2.3. Characterization
Powder diffractograms were recorded on a Bruker AXS D8 Advance diffractometer in the Bragg–Brentano geometry, with Cu Kα1 radiation, in a 2θ range from 6° to 60°. The reference data were taken from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD). Transmission-electron-microscopy (TEM) images were recorded on the FEI Tecnai G2 20 X-TWIN transmission electron microscope, which used an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.
The composition of the prepared materials was determined with a Varian ICP-OES VISTA-MPX inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer. The composition of the samples was similar to the theoretical one, with an error that did not exceed 4% of the intended value.
The luminescence characteristics (excitation, emission spectra, luminescence decays) of the prepared samples were measured on a QuantaMaster™ 40 spectrophotometer equipped with an Opolette 355LD UVDM tunable laser, which had a repetition rate of 20 Hz, as the excitation source and a Hamamatsu R928 photomultiplier as a detector. The curve fit for the decay data was performed with in Origin 9.0 software. The fit with the time traces was at least R2 = 0.998 and the errors were not larger than τerr < 0.01 ms.
3. Results and discussion
The hydrothermal method is a convenient way to synthesize nanomaterials that is widely used in materials science.29 This method allows for the control of the reaction occurring in the autoclave. REPO4 materials are insoluble in water, which makes it possible to synthesize them using this method. However, the reaction between (NH4)H2PO4 and RE(NO3)3 must be inhibited by chelating RE3+ ions with EDTA because otherwise, the precipitation reaction will occur before hydrothermal conditions are applied. In my experiments, after hydrothermal treatment, the products were composed of hydrated hexagonal LaPO4·0.5H2O nanorods. Annealing the reaction products at 900 °C caused them to transition into monoclinic LaPO4 nanocrystals.

Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the annealed materials compared to a reference pattern from the ICSD database. The experimental diffractograms agree well with monoclinic LaPO4 (ICSD #79747) with the space group of P21/n. The Yb3+, Tb3+ and Eu3+ dopant ions were neutral for the crystal system and phase composition. A small shift of the XRD peaks of the doped samples in comparison to the reference data can be observed. The differences in ionic radius between La3+ and Yb3+, Tb3+ and, to a smaller degree, Eu3+ ions is certainly responsible for this phenomenon. The substitution of the La3+ ions in the crystallographic structure by the smaller Yb3+, Tb3+ and Eu3+ ions reduces the cell dimensions of the crystal.

The as-prepared materials were composed of nanowires with an average length of 38 ± 7 nm and a thickness of ∼8 nm (see Fig. 1b). After annealing, a phase transition from a hexagonal to a monoclinic crystal structure had occurred, and the nanorods were reformed as spherical crystals with an average size of 43 ± 4 nm.
The removal of water from the materials and the change from a hexagonal to a monoclinic crystal structure resulted in the appearance of an UC, which was not observed in the as-prepared products.
The UC of the prepared materials is presented in Fig. 2a. As is characteristic for Ln3+, the f–f transition bands cover the spectral region between 470 and 725 nm, which is in the range of visible light. The excitation spectra (Fig. 2b) confirmed the effective absorption of NIR light, which corresponds to the electronic transition of the Yb3+ sensitizer ions. The most effective excitation was estimated to be at 978 nm. The broad character of the observed transition bands indicates the possibility of excitation by quite a large range of LED sources.

The observed emission spectra are composed of several bands that are associated with the transitions of the Tb3+ and Eu3+ ions from the 5D4 and 5D0 electronic levels, respectively, the ratio between which changes with Eu3+ concentration. Materials doped only with Yb3+ and Tb3+ ions exhibited green UC (Fig. 2c). Increasing the Eu3+ concentration shifted the colour of the emission to red, with intermediate yellowish and orange colours. Extremely small changes of the Eu3+ amounts (even by 0.005% in concentration) allowed tuning of the emission colour.
The emission of the sample doped only with 10% Yb3+ and 5% Eu3+ was very low (red line, Fig. 2a). Introduction of Tb3+ ions into the sample increased the UC emission by a factor of 1400.

Fig. 2d shows the luminescence decays of the LaPO4:Yb3+,Tb3+,Eu3+ nanocrystals under excitation by a laser with a wavelength of 978 nm. The luminescence process began with a relatively long rise in emission intensity, which was an effect of the energy transfer between the NIR-absorbing Yb3+ donors through the Tb3+ ions to the Eu3+ acceptors. This phenomenon was a result of the pumping of the 5D0 excited level of the Eu3+ ions. The character and luminescence lifetime of the observed decay curve for the Yb3+ ions validated the assertion that the absorbed energy was transferred from the Yb3+ to the Eu3+ ions. Applying the equation that has previously been presented elsewhere enabled the calculation of the rise and decay times from the recorded decays.30 The results of the calculations are presented in Fig. 2e. The luminescence lifetimes oscillated around 5 ms, which is a typical value for Eu3+ ions. In the case of the 5% doped sample, an observed shortening of the lifetime resulted from concentration quenching. The observed rise times are quite long for this type of materials; however, the value of 10.5 ms that was calculated for sample doped with 0.005% Eu3+ ions is extremely long and unusual. The rise time was longer than the decay time. This was because of the low Eu3+ concentration, which forced a long energy migration. The time necessary for the ET between ions is shortened by increasing the Eu3+ concentration. This property is especially useful for bio-related applications to increase the effectiveness of proper signal detection.
Energy transfer migration (ETM), which underlies the observed UC in developed systems, can improve the efficiency of emission that has been confirmed in previous results.31 This is because after the excitation of the sensitizer ions, energy is transferred from one Ln3+ ion to another in the ground state, lengthening the lifetime of the excited state and thereby increasing the probability of UC.31 This method has been previously used to achieve UC in systems containing a core/shell structure of fluoride nanocrystals and four types of lanthanide ions: Yb3+ → Tm3+ → Gd3+ → Ln3+.32,33
The dependence of the integral luminescence intensity on the pumping laser power (at 978 nm) was examined to fully analyse the nature of the UC process. The relation between the UC intensity IUC and the pumping intensity IP is given by the following equation: IUC = α(IP)n,(1)where α is a proportionality factor, and the exponent n represents the number of photons involved in the UC process.34Fig. 3b demonstrates that points plotted on a log scale can be fitted with a linear function that has a slope value of approximately 2. The obtained results indicated that two photons were involved in the energy transfer among the Eu3+, Tb3+ and Yb3+ ions, in agreement with the proposed CET mechanism.

The effectiveness of occurred energy transfer can be estimated from measured lifetimes by calculating energy transfer rates and energy transfer efficiencies. Assuming that up-conversion of Eu3+ ions is preceded by two energy transfers: between Yb3+ and Tb3+ ions (ET1) and Tb3+ and Eu3+ ions (ET2), energy transfer rate of all processes can be calculated from the following equations:35,36 (2) (3)where C*Yb is the concentration of excited state of Yb3+ ions, kET1 is the rate constant of energy transfer from Yb3+ to Tb3+ ions, k1 is the rate constant of luminescence of Yb3+ ions, τYb is the luminescence lifetime of Yb3+ ions in absence of other co-dopants and τYb−Tb−Eu is luminescence lifetime of Yb3+ ions in the presence of Tb3+ and Eu3+ ions. From the eqn (2) and (3), it is possible to calculate the energy rate constant, kET1 of energy transfer from Yb3+ to Tb3+ ions: kET1 = τYb−Tb−Eu−1 − k1 = τYb−Tb−Eu−1 − τYb−1(4)
The same procedure can be applied to calculate the rate constant kET2 of energy transfer from Tb3+ to Eu3+ ions: kET2 = τTb−Yb−Eu−1 − τTb−1(5)where, τTb is the luminescence lifetime of Tb3+ ions in absence of other co-dopants and τTb−Yb−Eu is luminescence lifetime of Tb3+ ions in the presence of Yb3+ and Eu3+ ions. Finally, the total transfer rate of energy transfer between Yb3+, through Tb3+ to Eu3+ ions can be expressed as: kET = kET1 + kET2 = τYb−Tb−Eu−1 − τYb−1 + τTb−Yb−Eu−1 − τTb−1(6)
Efficiency of energy transfer between Yb3+ and Tb3+ ions ηET1, can by calculated using following equation: (7)
The same way allows for calculation of energy transfer efficiency between Tb3+ and Eu3+ ions: (8)
Hence, total energy transfer efficiency can be expressed as: (9)
Energy transfer rates and efficiencies calculated for the sample showing the most intense luminescence are presented in Table 1. Energy transfer between Tb3+ and Eu3+ ions is almost three times faster than between Yb3+ and Tb3+ ions. Also energy transfer efficiency is higher in case of Tb3+ and Eu3+ pair of ions what is an effect of similarity between energy of their excited states. Also the way in which energy migrate from Yb3+ to Tb3+ ions, require cooperative mechanism what affected this process.

A scheme mapping the postulated energy processes occurring in the LaPO4:Yb3+,Tb3+,Eu3+ nanomaterials is presented in Fig. 3a. This diagram summarizes the interactions among the dopant ions that are responsible for the observed NIR-excited luminescence. The excitation of the Yb3+ ions under a 978 nm wavelength resulted in CET processes toward the excited-state energy levels of the Tb3+ ions. These ions can partially undergo relaxation accompanied by the emission of green light. However, because of the close energies of the Tb3+ and Eu3+ excited states, a large part of the energy can be transferred to Eu3+ ions, which results in their red emission. Fig. 3c shows luminescence decays of Yb3+, Tb3+ and Eu3+ ions of the LaPO4:10% Yb3+,40% Tb3+,5% Eu3+ sample. The energy transfer between Yb3+ and Tb3+ ions is visible as the rise of Tb3+ luminescence with decreasing luminescence intensity of Yb3+ ions in the same time. With increasing emission intensity of Tb3+ ions also Eu3+ emission is rising. However the energy transfer between Tb3+ and Eu3+ ions results in a small delay of Eu3+ emission and shifted maximum of intensity.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, I have developed nanomaterials with bright and tunable up-conversion luminescence from Eu3+ ions. For the synthesis, a simple hydrothermal method was used, followed by annealing at 900 °C. The materials were co-doped with Yb3+, which acted as sensitizer ions for the NIR wavelengths, and Tb3+ ions, which bridged the energy levels of the Yb3+ and Eu3+ ions and increased the probability of UC. The UC intensity was increased by a factor of more than 1400 by the introduction of Tb3+ ions. Calculated rates and efficiencies of energy transfers between Yb3+ and Tb3+ as well as Tb3+ and Eu3+ showed effectiveness of this process in the studied materials. One of the most unusual properties of the synthesized nanomaterials was their very long rise time, which exceeded 10 ms.
