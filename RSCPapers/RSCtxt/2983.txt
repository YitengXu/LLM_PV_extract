The device performance was influenced by the position of the two C60 moieties linked together.
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) are of great interest as low cost photovoltaics.1 The key component of the device is the active layer composed of a mixture of a hole-transporting polymer and an electron-transporting fullerene with an interpenetrating network, so called bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) structures, where the large interfacial area induces efficient charge separation. The BHJ solar cells composed of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), used as donor and acceptor materials, respectively, have been well-studied.1 By following the guidelines for synthesizing efficient PSCs,2 a variety of donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers with a narrow bandgap have been reported during the last few years,3 and high power conversion efficiency (PCE) values have been achieved in combination with PCBM or its C70 analogue, PC71BM. Among these, the PTB7:PC71BM-based device (PCE = 9.2%) is one of the most successful PSCs.4 In contrast to the rapid progress in the development of the donor polymers, applications of novel fullerene derivatives to such polymers have been little successful.5 Although there are a few reports on the fullerene C60 derivatives which showed a photovoltaic performance comparable/superior to that of PCBM in combination with D–A copolymers, the PCEs were not higher than 3–5%.6  
Recently, the photovoltaic performances of dimeric fullerene derivatives in combination with P3HT were reported by several groups. Martín et al. synthesized fullerene dimers albeit showing a rather low performance (PCE ≤ 1%).7 Qin et al. also synthesized dimers and trimers, where C60 units were chained with long and flexible aliphatic spacer(s).8 In this research, we provide new tightly linked C60 dimers which showed excellent performance in combination with both P3HT and PTB7 (the best PCE = 6.1%).
We designed two dumbbell-shaped C60 derivatives where two C60 moieties are linked at the para- and meta-position of a phenyl ring (PDB and MDB in Scheme 1). In light of the close distance and rigidity of the linker compared to other reported dimers,7,8 these dimers are suitable for understanding how the position of linked C60 moieties influences the device performance. Although the synthesis was carried out by basically following the procedure reported for PCBM,9 we prepared new precursors 5a–b for diazo compounds possessing two tosylhydrazone units as shown in Scheme 1. First, the reactions of phthalaldehydes 1a–b with 2-amino-3-picoline afforded diimines 2a–b in good yields. Then, hydroacylation of 2a–b with methyl 3-butenoate in the presence of Wilkinson's catalyst and subsequent acid hydrolysis afforded tetracarbonyl compounds 3a–b.10 To overcome the expected low solubility of the target dimers, transesterification of 3a–b with nBuOH was conducted by using pentafluorophenylammonium triflate (PFPAT) as a catalyst11 to afford 4a–b. The phenyl ketone moieties of 4a–b were quantitatively transformed into tosylhydrazones to give 5a–b. Finally, diazo compounds were generated by treatment of 5a–b with NaH and were trapped in situ by C60 to afford PDB and MDB in 23% and 37% yields, respectively. PDB and MDB (R = nBu) showed high solubility similar to that of PCBM, while corresponding dimers with shorter alkyl chains (R = Me, Et, and nPr) were hardly soluble in common organic solvents.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of PDB and MDB. 
The UV-vis absorption spectra of PDB, MDB, and PCBM in cyclohexane showed small peaks at 430 nm in all the cases, indicating their [6,6] methanofullerene structures (see the ESI†). The absorption coefficients of PDB and MDB are doubled with respect to that of PCBM, reflecting little interaction between the two C60 moieties. The electrochemical properties of PDB and MDB were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (see the ESI†). Both dimers exhibited three sets of pseudo-reversible two-electron reduction waves, indicating that there is little electronic communication between the two closely linked cages. In addition, the reduction waves appeared at almost the same potentials as those of PCBM, indicating that the LUMO levels are almost identical.
Following our previous work,12 we fabricated PSCs based on the glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:fullerene/TiOx/Al configuration (see also the ESI†). We first optimized fabrication conditions of the active layer composed of P3HT and dimeric fullerenes PDB and MDB. The optimal donor/acceptor weight ratios and annealing time of the active layers were found to be almost identical to those of the P3HT:PCBM-based standard cell. Thus, the active layer (thickness ca. 110 nm) was prepared using the spin-coating technique from a chlorobenzene (PhCl) solution of P3HT and dimeric fullerene at 1.6:1 weight ratio. Subsequently thermal annealing was conducted at 150 °C for 6 min.
Next, as to the active layers composed of PTB7 and dimeric fullerenes, we found that o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) is suitable as the solvent for the spin-coating method rather than PhCl. Thus, the solutions containing PTB7 and dimeric fullerenes at 1:1 weight ratio were spin-coated to form the active layer (thickness ca. 90 nm). Again these optimized conditions were almost identical to those optimized for the PTB7:PCBM-based cell.
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves measured under AM 1.5 G illumination are shown in Fig. 1, and the corresponding photovoltaic performances are summarized in Table 1. When we compare the performances of P3HT-based cells, the cell using MDB as the acceptor material showed inferior performance (PCE = 2.75%), while the PDB-based cell showed a decent PCE of 3.32%, which is comparable to that of the PCBM-based cell (PCE = 3.27%). In spite of the similar LUMO levels, Voc and Jsc for the P3HT:MDB-based cell decreased as compared to those for PDB- and PCBM-based cells. Although the reason for this decrease is not clear, similar data were often reported when the morphology of the active layer was not suitable.13

More importantly, when the D–A copolymer PTB7 was used as the donor material, the PDB-based cell again showed good performance (PCE = 6.14%), which is comparable to that of the PCBM-based cell (PCE = 6.24%) owing to an increase in Voc and Jsc. In a similar manner to the above-mentioned P3HT-based cell, the PTB7:MDB-based cell showed inferior performance (PCE = 5.69%). This is due to the slight decrease in the Jsc and FF values while the Voc value is almost the same as that of PDB.
These results obtained from both P3HT- and PTB7-based cells suggest that the molecular structure of the dimers is very important to achieve high Jsc and FF values. Such a small difference in structures might affect the film morphology and/or the electron mobility in fullerene-rich domains.14 Considering that the structural modification of PCBM has mostly led to inferior performance,15 it is interesting that dimeric fullerenes showed high photovoltaic characteristics and applicability even to PTB7. To the best of our knowledge, PDB and MDB are the first dimeric fullerenes applicable to the PTB7-based cell.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the PSCs are shown in Fig. 2. When P3HT was used as the donor material, the PDB-based cell exhibited a curve with a maximum of 58% at 520 nm, which is almost overlapped with that of the PCBM-based cell, while the MDB-based cell showed apparently decreased EQE values. In the case of PSCs using PTB7 as the donor material, the EQE curves for the dimeric fullerenes and PCBM-based cells appeared to be almost overlapped but slightly inferior for the MDB-based cell. The maximum EQE values were 67% for PDB- and MDB-based cells and 69% for the PCBM-based cell at 630 nm.

We used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to obtain information about the active layers (see the ESI†). All of the P3HT- and PTB7-based active layers showed similar root mean square (rms) roughness: 1.1 nm for P3HT:PDB, 1.3 nm for P3HT:MDB, 1.1 nm for P3HT:PCBM, 1.3 nm for PTB7:PDB, 1.6 nm for PTB7:MDB, and 1.5 nm for PTB7:PCBM, respectively. Although a clear difference was not observed in the rms roughness, the image of the PTB7:MDB blend film appeared to show a more detailed texture compared with the images of PTB7:PDB and PTB7:PCBM blend films. We considered that the insufficient formation of an effective channel for the electron transport could be one of the reasons for the inferior performance of the MDB-based cell due to the meta-connection of the two C60 cages, which would cause less condensed packing and/or formation of smaller domains than the para-connection in the active layer.
In summary, dumbbell-shaped C60 derivatives PDB and MDB, where two cages are rigidly linked in close proximity, were synthesized and their photovoltaic properties were investigated in both P3HT- and PTB7-based solar cells. These dimeric fullerenes were shown to work as excellent acceptor materials comparable to benchmark PCBM. The data demonstrated that these dimeric fullerenes can be added as a new acceptor material applicable to D–A copolymer systems. It was shown that the difference in the position of the linked C60 moieties influenced their photovoltaic performances, especially Jsc and FF values. This finding would provide the possibility of controlling the morphology of the active layers, which is significant in the design of acceptor materials. Although we used the photo-CELIV (charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage) technique16 to measure the carrier mobility and the charge density of the PSCs, conclusive results have not been obtained yet to account for the difference in PCEs in terms of the differences in molecular structures of the acceptor fullerenes. More detailed studies on the design of dimeric fullerenes and carrier transport properties are currently underway.
