    , Accepted 22nd December 2015First published on 22nd December 2015AbstractLayer-like nanocarbons with high surface area and good conductivity are promising materials for supercapacitors due to their good ability for effective charge-transfer and mass-transfer. In this paper, stacked layer-like porous carbon containing RGO (reduced graphene oxides) (LPCG) was constructed via the GO-induced assembly of gelatin followed by carbonization and activation processes. Under suitable conditions, LPCG-based materials with a thickness of about 100 nm and a high specific surface area (up to 1476 m2 g−1) could be obtained. In the materials, the closed combination of RGO and porous carbon can be observed, which is favourable for the development of the synergistic effects of both components. The presence of GO can not only enhance the conductivity of LPCG-based materials, but also is essential for the formation of a thin carbon sheet with a stacked structure. Otherwise, the plate-like, non-stacked carbon with a thickness of about 500 nm could be formed in the absence of RGO. The porous structure along with the presence of RGO allows rapid charge-transfer and easy access and diffusion of electrolyte ions. As a result, the materials exhibited a high discharge specific capacitance (455 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, 366 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), good rate capability (221 F g−1 at density 30 A g−1) and good cycling stability. In aqueous electrolytes, the energy density could be up to 9.32 W h kg−1 at a relatively low power density of 500 W kg−1 with a good cycling stability (>96% over 5000 cycles). It was found that (1) the rational combination of RGO and porous carbon is essential for enhancing the capacitance performance and improving the cycling stability and (2) the high conductivity is favorable for improving the rate performance of the materials. The LPCG-based materials have extensive potential for practical applications in energy storage and conversion devices.
1. Introduction
Excessive consumption of fossil fuels and subsequent serious environmental issues are being faced by people around the world. A new energy-storage instrument is being pursued to effectively utilize the renewable energy sources (wind, solar etc.) because the availability of these resources fluctuates with time.1,2 Supercapacitors (SCs, also called ultra-capacitors) are promising in view of their ultrafast charge–discharge rate, high power capability, and long lifespan (>105 cycles) with good pulse charge–discharge capacity.3 The SCs can also be combined with rechargeable batteries to accelerate a vehicle at startup. Electrode materials are considered to play the most important role in determining the performance of SCs. Compared with metal oxide4 and conducting polymers,5 carbon materials possess the advantages of low cost, good electrical conductivity and improved stability, which generate the large potential of carbon as electrode materials.6 In carbon materials, the energy is stored and released by the adsorption and desorption of carrier ions on the electrode.7 Thus, materials with a high surface area and good conductivity are needed for storing ions and transferring charges effectively. However, activated carbon materials with a high SBET (above 2000 m2 g−1) only exhibit a limited improvement in capacitance because ion transport and electron transfer are confined by the low mesoporosity and poor conductivity.8 Engineering the microstructure of carbon materials to tune the porous structures and electronic conductivity thus is being intensively studied.9
The layer (or sheet)-like carbon has emerged as a suitable candidate for a supercapacitor electrode due to its special structure suitable for supercapacitor application. Graphene, a 2-dimensional (2D) carbon material, has been considered to be a promising candidate because of its high electrical conductivity and large theoretical specific surface area (∼2650 m2 g−1).10 Despite this promising intrinsic property, the practical capacitance of graphene (RGO) could only reach a small fraction of the theoretical value (550 F g−1),11 mainly owing to the overlapping and irreversible re-stacking of individual RGO materials which lose the available surface areas.12 To overcome these problems, a combination of other carbon materials (i.e., porous microspheres, nanotubes, carbon black, etc.) with RGO has been investigated.13 In these cases, some compounded carbon materials (such as CNTs and carbon spheres) have only given low surface areas that is not favourable to improve the performance of the final carbon materials. Also, the difference in the morphology will result in incomplete contact of the intercalated carbon with RGO. Recently, layer-like porous carbon (LPC) materials have been considered as suitable candidates for supercapacitor electrodes. The porous sheet-like structure can shorten the ion migration path on nanoscale dimensions, thereby giving an improved capacitance.14 LPCs from seaweeds,15 dead leaves,16 raw blood protein,17 amaranthus,18 silk proteins,19 potassium citrate20 and corn stalk21a and corn cob21b have been reported to have improved energy storage performance. However, the LPCs have a lower graphitization degree, thus decreasing their conductivity that is not favourable for charge-transfer. It is considered that the rational combination of layer-like porous carbon with RGO can be an effective way to prepare advanced electrode materials based on the advantage of the good conductivity of RGO and the high specific surface area of porous carbon. Also, the RGO and layer-like porous carbon can be combined more effectively face to face since both of them are layer-like structures. In this regard, RGO coupled 2D porous carbon has been designed through coupling a Schiff-base porous polymer with RGO, which can give a specific capacitance of 424 F g−1 (0.1 A g−1).22 Hybrid carbon nanosheets consisting of graphene and microporous carbon layers were also fabricated by using poly(benzoxazineco-resol) as a carbon precursor.23 We have also reported the soft-template synthesis of mesoporous carbon/graphene materials with a capacitance of 242 F g−1 (0.5 A g−1), in which a triblock copolymer and resol were used as the mesopore directing template and the carbon source, respectively.24
To combine the porous materials with RGO effectively, the carbon source for porous carbon should be first combined with GO. The interaction between the carbon source and GO is thus important to finally give an intimately contacted porous carbon/RGO material. Gelatin, a renewable biomass resource, possesses rich –NH3 groups that can combine with –OH and –COOH of GO.25 Besides, gelatin biomass is naturally renewable and non-toxic compared with poly(benzoxazineco-resol), phenol formaldehyde resins, and Schiff-base type porous polymers etc. So, gelatin should be a suitable carbon source for the construction of PC/RGO. In this paper, we have reported that the GO-induced assembly of gelatin provides a potential way to construct LPC with improved conductivity and high specific surface area. The RGO and gelatin dispersion were firstly assembled in water because both of them have high dispersion in water. After carbonization of the assembly followed by activation with KOH, materials consisting of layer-like porous carbon combined with RGO, named LPCG, were obtained. The LPCG materials have a large specific surface area (about 1476 m2 g−1) and improved conductivity. In particular, as a supercapacitor electrode, the LPCG has a higher discharge specific capacitance of 455 F g−1 (0.5 A g−1), and 366 F g−1 (1 A g−1), and good rate capability (221 F g−1 at density 30 A g−1). In aqueous electrolytes, the energy density could be up to 9.32 W h kg−1 at a relatively low power density of 500 W kg−1. Compared with the porous carbon derived from gelatin and porous RGO, the LPCG exhibited improved performance for energy storage, which can be ascribed to the synergistic action of the good conductivity of RGO and the high surface area of layer-like porous carbon.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials and chemicals
Natural graphite powder, H2O2 (30%), H2SO4 (98%), HCl (12 mol L−1), gelatin and KMnO4 were supplied by Aladdin Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All of the reactants in the experiments were of analytical grade and used as received without any further purification.
2.2 Synthesis of the LPCG composites
The LPCG was prepared by the coordinated assembly of gelatin and GO in aqueous solution followed by carbonation and activation processes as shown in Scheme 1. A typical synthesis is as follows. Gelatin (1.5 g) was dissolved in 20 mL water at 40 °C. Then, 50 mL GO dispersion (2 mg mL−1) was added into the aqueous gelatin solution (weight ratio of GO:gelatin = 1:15). The mixture was stirred under water bath conditions to obtain a homogeneous dispersion. The solution was stirred at 95 °C until dry to obtain an assembly of GO and gelatin (Step 1). The solid was then heated to 600 °C under a flowing N2 atmosphere (50 sccm) at a rate of 5 °C min−1 and carbonized at this temperature for 2 h. A gelatin derived carbon/RGO precursor was obtained (Step 2). The precursor was mixed with KOH (1:4 in mass ratio) and then activated under a N2 atmosphere at 600 °C for 2 h (temperature-programmed heating at a rate of 5 °C min−1, Step 3). The final sample was washed with 1 mol L−1 HCl and distilled water. The sample was denoted as LPCG-2-600, where 2 represented the ratio of gelatin and GO (15), and 600 is the activation temperature. To simplify, the carbonation temperature is not reflected for samples carbonized at 600 °C. A series of samples could be obtained by rationally tuning the weight ratio of GO to gelatin. PC-600 was prepared by a similar process to LPCG-2-600, except that there is absence of GO in the synthesis. The carbonation and activation temperatures are also changed to study the effect of the parameters on the performance. The samples and their corresponding preparation conditions are listed in Table S1.†

2.3 Characterization
The morphology of the samples was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM: JEM-2100, acceleration voltage of 200 kV) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM: Hitachi S-4800, acceleration voltage of 5 kV). Carbon-coated copper grids were used as sample holders for TEM analysis. XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) analysis was performed on a VG ESCALABMK II with an Mg Ka achromatic X-ray source (1253.6 eV). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Bruker D8 diffractometer using Cu Ka (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation. The accelerating voltage and the applied current were 40 kV and 20 mA, respectively. Raman measurement was performed with a Jobin Yvon HR 800 micro-Raman spectrometer at 457.9 nm. The BET test was performed at 77 K with a Micromeritics Tristar II surface area and a porosimetry analyzer. In the test, the catalyst (more than 100 mg) was degassed under vacuum at 150 °C for 5 h before the measurement. The pore size distribution and surface area were determined from desorption isotherms by the BJH and BET methods, respectively.
2.4 Preparation of electrodes and electrochemical tests
For the three-electrode test, the working electrodes were fabricated by mixing the LPCG samples with 5 wt% polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) binder and 5 wt% acetylene black. The slurry was coated onto a nickel foam substrate (1 cm × 1 cm). The amount of the mixture deposited onto the electrode was about 4 mg. The electrochemical measurements were performed using a three-electrode electrochemical system. A platinum plate (1 cm × 1 cm) and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry and the charge–discharge tests were performed in a 6 M KOH solution in a −0.2 to −1.1 V potential window.
Two electrode cells were assembled with a configuration of 2025-type coin cell, in which LPCG-2-600 was used as a supercapacitor electrode and 6 M aqueous KOH as an electrolyte. To fabricate the two electrode cell, the active material (LPCG-2-600, 80 wt%), acetylene black (10 wt%), and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, 10 wt%) in methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) were mixed well. The slurry was pressed over a copper foil and dried at 110 °C for 6 h in a vacuum oven. Then they were cut into circular electrodes with a diameter of 10 mm. A symmetric supercapacitor was constructed with two similar electrodes separated by an NKK film (with a diameter of 11 mm) and filled with 6 M KOH electrolyte.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 The structure characterization of LPCG
The structure of LPCG-2-600 has been firstly analyzed by means of SEM and TEM (Fig. 1). The SEM image shows the sheet-like morphology. The thickness of the layer is below 200 nm as shown in Fig. 1a. From the highly magnified SEM images (inset in Fig. 1a), we can see that the layers are composed of many stacked sheets. The TEM image gives more information about the structure. As can be seen from Fig. 1b, the LPCG-2-600 sample presents a layer-like structure which is consistent with SEM. An enlarged TEM image indicates that the layers consist of many stacked thinner sheets (Fig. 1c). In addition, from the high resolution TEM (HR-TEM), we can obviously see the lattice finger of carbon from RGO, indicating the incorporation of RGO into the layers (Fig. 1d). The SAED test further supports the incorporation of RGO within porous carbon sheets (Fig. S1†). Due to the good crystallinity of RGO, the incorporation of RGO into the sheets can improve the conductivity of the materials largely, which is reflected by XRD and Raman spectra. The XRD spectrum in Fig. 2a shows one peak at about 25°, corresponding to the (002) spacing of carbon,26 while in the Raman spectrum of LPCG-2-600, the narrow D peak and G peak can be observed. A 2D band at about 2650 cm−1 is visible for the sample, further demonstrating the more ordered crystal structures of the sample (Fig. 2b).27

The above results indicate the formation of a layer-like carbon containing RGO. The presence of RGO is conducive to enhancing the conductivity, and thus improving the charge-transfer ability of the materials. To achieve easy access and rapid diffusion of electrolyte ions, the large surface areas and plentiful pores are needed for the electrode materials.28 The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms are analysed to gain the information. It can be seen that the LPCG-2-600 sample exhibits a typical IV nitrogen isotherm, which indicates the coexistence of micropores and mesopores (Fig. S2†). The wide pore size distribution curve (inset in Fig. S2†) implies that LPCG-2-600 has a large number of mesopores with a few micropores. Some pores with a large size should be derived from the interspace of the stacked structure. The result reveals that the average pore size of LPCG-2-600 is about 7.24 nm. The BET surface area and total pore volume are about 1476 m2 g−1 and 0.058 cm3 g−1, respectively. The high specific surface area and plentiful mesopores of LPCG-2-600 can provide lots of ion adsorption sites and a high density of interconnected ion diffusion pathways that favor transporting electrolyte ions in the LPCG-2-600 electrode material.
It is known that the hetero-atom (N, S) in the carbon source can remain partially after pyrolysis, so as to give doped carbon for improving the capacitance performance.29 Gelatin is a kind of biomass containing C, N and O elements. Therefore, the LPCG-2-600 obtained from the pyrolysis of gelatin combined with RGO may be doped with N atoms. XPS (Fig. 3) is used to measure the elemental composition of the materials. The survey spectrum in Fig. 3a shows the presence of C (about 285 eV), N (about 399 eV) and O (about 531 eV) elements in the sample. No other elements can be observed. The mass ratio of N, C, and O elements in LPCG-2-600 is about 2.95%, 86.16 and 10.89%, respectively. The C 1s spectrum can be deconvoluted into five sub-peaks (I, II, III, IV and V, Fig. 3b). Peak I at the binding energy (BE) of 284.6 eV represents the carbon in C–C, CC and C–H forms.30 The peaks at a higher binding energy than 284.6 eV may be ascribed to the carbon combined with elements with high electronegativity (N and O).31 Specifically, Peak II (285.2 eV) is ascribed to the carbon from C–N bonds. The N should be from gelatin as there is no addition of an additional N source.32 This indicates that during the pyrolysis process, the N in gelatin can remain partially. The peaks III, IV and V correspond to the carbon from C–O bonds (286.2 eV), CO bonds (289.2 eV) and carboxyl groups (OC–O) (291.2 eV), respectively.33 The intensive C–C peak and weaker peaks in comparison with C–N, especially the C–O and O–CO, imply the less defect of carbon in the samples. In addition, the high-resolution XPS spectrum shows the presence of four types of N-containing groups (Fig. 3c and d). They are respectively ascribed to the pyridinic-N (N-1, about 398.25 eV), pyridine-N (N-2, about 400.1 eV), quaternary-N (N-3, about 401.4 eV), and N-oxide (N-4, about 404.1 eV).34 The N-1, N-2 and N-3 are formed by substituting one carbon atom with N on edges or defect sites in the plane, because the carbon atoms located at edges are much more chemically active than those within the plane of RGO. The N-1 and N-2 can usually provide the pseudocapacitance. The N-3 can improve the electrical conductivity of carbon, so it is advantageous for electron transfer. The nitrogen content of LPCG-2-600 calculated from XPS analysis is about 3 at%. Among them, the N-1 and N-2 contribute about 2.3 at%, which is predominant in the product. The presence of doped-N, especially the predominant N-1 and N-2, have greatly enhanced the capacitance of carbon materials.35

3.2 The structure tuning and the study of the formation process of the LPCG sample
All the above tests indicate the formation of layer-like porous carbon combined with RGO that possesses the improved conductivity, high surface area and plentiful pores. Previous work indicated that the layer-like porous carbon could be obtained by the direct pyrolysis of biomass, such as corn stalk, seaweeds, and dead leaves. In these cases, the formation of the sheet-like structure should be related to the intrinsic structure of the carbon source. In the case where the carbon sources are not feasible to form the sheet-like structure, GO has been introduced to act as a 2-D template. Typically, poly(benzoxazineco-resol),23 phenol formaldehyde resins,24 and Schiff-base porous polymers22 have been assembled on a GO template. After pyrolysis, layer-like carbon-RGO composites can be obtained. In many cases, synthesis needs to be sophisticatedly controlled with a slightly complicated process. Compared with these methods, the present route is simpler and can be easily handled in water. More importantly, gelatin is naturally renewable, and non-toxic compared with most carbon sources used before. The formation of LPCG in the present work should be relative to the introduction of GO in the synthesis. Thus, the amount of GO (more specifically, the ratio of gelatin and RGO) should have an important effect on the micro-structure of the final materials. A series of samples, including LPCG-1-600 and LPCG-3-600, were prepared. PC-600 and RGO-600 from the pyrolysis and activation of only gelatin and GO also were synthesized, respectively. The samples were firstly tested by XRD and Raman methods. Fig. 4a shows the XRD patterns of different samples, all of which have a reflection at a 2θ between 22–26°. RGO-600 shows the narrowest and sharpest peaks at 2θ = 26.1° among all samples, corresponding to the (002) spacing of carbon.36 With the increase of the content of gelatin, the peak in the range of 22–26° broadens. At the same time, the shift of the peaks toward the lower degree can also be obviously observed. PC-600 possesses the broadest peak at about 23.1°, implying that there are more disordered structures.20b At the same time, the peak at 2θ = 43° assigned to (010) diffraction becomes weaker with the increase of gelatin amount in the synthesis, indicating the trend to weaken the graphitic degree.37 The results imply the formation of more disordered structures with the increase of the ratio of gelatin to GO.
 Fig. 4  (a) XRD patterns and (b) Raman spectra of RGO-600, LPCG-1-600, LPCG-3-600 and PC-600. 
The Raman spectra of typical samples are shown in Fig. 4b. All samples show characteristic bands of D and G. The D band near 1360 cm−1 is caused by the defects and disorders in the hexagonal graphitic layers. The G band near 1580 cm−1 is attributed to the amorphous sp2-bonded forms of carbon.27 It is obvious that there are broad D and G peaks for PC-600 implying the disordered crystal structures of the sample by the combination with the XRD results. In contrast, all samples containing RGO (LPCG-1-600 to LPCG-3-600) show the narrow D peaks and G peaks. The increase of the content of gelatin results in the broadening of D peaks and G peaks. Also, for RGO, LPCG-1-600 and LPCG-2-600, a broad 2D band at about 2650 cm−1 is visible, but it is not obvious for PC-600 and LPCG-3-600 samples, further demonstrating the more ordered crystal structures of LPCG-1-600, LPCG-2-600 and RGO-600 than that of PC-600 and LPCG-3-600.27b The results indicate that the crystallinity can be improved in the presence of RGO, consistent with the results from XRD.
Besides the crystallinity, the BET specific surface is also an important factor that can affect the application performance of the materials. The BET surface areas of different samples are listed in Table S2 and Fig. S3.† The BET specific surface increases in the order of RGO (293 m2 g−1) < LPCG-1-600 (1418 m2 g−1) < LPCG-2-600 (1476 m2 g−1) < LPCG-3-600 (1580 m2 g−1) < PC-600 (1642 m2 g−1). The RGO has a low SBET value of 293 m2 g−1, being close to most RGO and doped RGO materials.38 But, it is far below the theoretical values due to the stacking of RGO sheets. PC-600 has the highest SBET, which is ascribed to the plentiful pore structure. All LPCG samples have a larger SBET than RGO-600, ascribed to the high surface area of the porous carbon. Moreover, the SBET value increases with the increase of gelatin amount (that is, the PC amount in the LPCG). LPCG-2-600 provides a moderate SBET that is slightly lower than that of PC-600. The results indicate that by rational combination of RGO and porous carbon, the preparation of carbon-based materials with both large SBET and good conductivity can been realized. Also, like LPCG-2-600, C, N and O elements can be found in PC-600, LPCG-1-600 and LPCG-3-600 samples (Fig. S4 and S5†). Besides the ratio of gelatin and GO, the activation temperature and carbonization temperature have also some effects on the microstructure of the final sample. It is found that samples from the low activation temperature (LPCG-2-500) have shown the worse crystallinity than that from the higher ones (LPCG-2-600, LPCG-2-700). Also, the increase of the activation temperature will result in the increase of the SBET (Fig. S6 and S7†). It is shown that the change of the carbonization temperature has no large effect on XRD and Raman results (Fig. S8†). However, there are some effects on specific surface areas (Fig. S9†). The conductivity test indicates that the conductivity improves with the increase of RGO amount and the activation temperature (Table S3†).
To understand the formation process, several typical samples are tested by means of TEM and SEM, including RGO-600, LPCG-1-600 and PC-600. We can see that all of the materials show sheet-like morphology (Fig. 5). RGO-600 is the thinnest one among all the samples. Many folding can be found in the RGO sample (Fig. 5a), which is consistent with the reports on RGO materials. By combination with the SEM result of LPCG-2-600, it can be seen that the sheets thicken with the increase of gelatin amount. The LPCG-1-600 sample gives an “even” surface (little folding) as shown in SEM (Fig. 5b). This should be relative to the combination (or coverage) with the porous carbon, so that folding can be prevented. Notably, for PC-600 from gelatin, the sheets with a thickness of about 500 nm can be formed (Fig. 5c). TEM tests also show the thin sheets for RGO-600 and LPCG-1-600, and thick sheets for PC-600 (Fig. 5d–f). No folding and stacked structure can be observed for PC-600. The results indicate that the presence of RGO can not only enhance the conductivity of materials, but can also be conducive to the formation of a thin layer with a stacked structure. The morphology is slightly different from a previous report about carbon obtained from the pyrolysis of gelatin.37 In that work, carbon was obtained by direct pyrolysis of solid gelatin at 450 °C. In the present synthesis, gelatin was firstly dissolved in water, and then evaporated to obtain a solid that was pyrolyzed at 600 °C. The difference in morphology should be relative to different preparation conditions. The result demonstrates that the structure can be controlled by changing the proportion of GO and gelatin. In conclusion, GO plays an important role in inducing the material to form a sheet structure and the gelatin content has a great influence on the thickness of LPCG-based materials.

Based on the above analyses, the formation of LPCG with a stacked, layer-like structure can be proposed as follows. After adding the aqueous dispersion of GO into the gelatin solution, the coordination of GO and gelatin can happen due to the interaction of the N-containing group in gelatin and the O-containing group in GO. The coordination of GO and gelatin can prevent the GO (or gelatin) from coming in contact with each other. Namely, GO was separated by gelatin, and at the same time the gelatin was separated by GO too. Under heating, the carbonization of gelatin would be processed in the “confined” space of GO, so as to generate thin carbon sheets. The formation of carbon sheets is also relative to the GO due to its role as a template. Meanwhile, GO was reduced to form RGO. As a result, porous carbon sheets combined with RGO are finally obtained. Both the sides of GO can be incorporated into gelatin, and each gelatin can also combine with two separated GOs, like “glue”. Therefore, the stacked layer-like structure consisting of many sheets can be formed under suitable conditions. The formation of a stacked structure is also favourable for improving the stability of the material. In the case of the absence of GO, the contact of gelatin is more easier, so as to produce thick carbon layers.
3.3 The electrochemical performance
The above analyses demonstrate the formation of porous carbon sheets/RGO composites with a stacked structure by the GO-induced assembly route. The large BET surface area and plentiful pores are favourable for ion adsorption and electrolyte ion transport in the materials. The presence of RGO can enhance the conductivity of composites at the same time. Both of them are favorable for the application of materials as supercapacitor electrodes.

Fig. 6a shows the CV curves of the samples at 20 mV s−1. The CV curve of RGO-600 exhibits a more rectangular shape, implying the main contribution of the electrochemical double layer (EDL). The curves are not well symmetrical and a peak at around −0.7 V can be observed for LPCG-based materials. The emergence of the peak is due to the pseudocapacitive contribution from electrochemically active functional groups. Thus, the capacitive response of the LPCG-based materials stems from the combination of EDLC and redox reactions. The specific capacitance is proportional to the area in the CV curve. It is clear that the LPCG-2-600 sample has a much larger area than other samples. The CV profiles of LPCG-2-600 are tested at different scan rates from 10 mV s−1 to 200 mV s−1 (Fig. 6b). With the increase of the scan rate, the CV curves are distorted gradually, which may have been caused by the increase of the potential drop because of the electrode resistance and relatively insufficient Raradic redox reaction at a higher scan rate.39

The galvanostatic charge–discharge is an effective method to evaluate the electrochemical performance of electrode materials. All the charge–discharge tests were performed at a current density of 1 A g−1 in 6 M KOH. Fig. 7a shows the charge–discharge curves of LPCG-based materials, RGO-600 and PC-600. The LPCG-based materials and PC-600 show approximately a linear and triangular shape, which suggests the presence of pseudocapacitance from the reversible Faradic reaction due to little N heteroatoms.35,38b The curves for RGO-600 display a more symmetric triangle feature, indicating the main contribution of the EDL capacitor. The discharge specific capacitances for different samples are about 260 F g−1 (LPCG-1-600), 366 F g−1 (LPCG-2-600), 301 F g−1 (LPCG-3-600), 221 F g−1 (PC-600), and 143 F g−1 (RGO-600). All LPCG-based samples possess higher discharge capacitances than RGO-600 and PC-600. The result indicates that the rational combination of RGO and porous carbon is effective to improve the performance of carbon materials. Also, it can be seen that LPCG-2-600 shows a high discharge specific capacitance of 366 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. The capacitance of LPCG-2-600 is further tested through galvanostatic charge–discharge experiments at different current densities (Fig. 7b). The discharge specific capacitance of the LPCG-2-600 electrode is calculated to be about 455 F g−1 (Fig. S9†), 366 F g−1, 294 F g−1, 286 F g−1, 256 F g−1 and 243 F g−1 at current densities of 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 A g−1, respectively. The value at 1 A g−1 for LPCG-2-600 is higher than those for RGO-600 and PC-600. It also shows a relatively higher specific capacitance than most of the carbon-based materials, for example the heteroatom-doped carbon,35 rGO,38b,40 porous carbon,41a N-doped graphene–CNT networks,41b porous graphene41c and carbon–carbon plate composites41d (Table S4†). Fig. 7c shows the capacitance performance of typical materials at different current densities (from 1 A to 30 A with an interval of 1 A). Typically, the discharge capacitance values at 30 A g−1 are still about 221 A g−1 for LPCG-2-600 (about 60% of the values at 1 A g−1), 176 F g−1 for LPCG-1-600, 153 F g−1 for LPCG-3-600, 103 F g−1 for RGO-600 and 57 F g−1 for PC-600. The LPCG-2-600 exhibits the highest discharge capacitance at different current densities among all the samples studied. The excellent capacitance at high current density can be attributed to the good conductivity benefited from RGO. The benefit of RGO for rate capacitance can also be verified by the ratio of capacitance at different current densities. The capacitance at 30 A g−1 is about 60%, 67%, 51%, 26% and 72% of those at 1 A g−1 for LPCG-2-600, LPCG-1-600, LPCG-3-600, PC-600 and RGO-600, respectively. As can be seen, PC-600 has the lowest retention, and RGO-600 is the best one. In addition, all LPCG-based samples show improved retention in comparison with PC-600. Besides the ratio of gelatin and GO, the activation temperature and carbonization temperature have also some effects on the capacitance performance. For the samples prepared at different activation and carbonization temperatures, the discharge capacitance is about 300 F g−1 (LPCG-2-600 (500)), 265 F g−1 (LPCG-2-600 (700)), 317 F g−1 (LPCG-2-500) and 257 F g−1 (LPCG-2-700) (Fig. S10–S12†). The results show the importance of selecting the suitable activation and carbonization temperature. The tests further indicate that (1) the enhancements of the conductivity are favorable for the improvements of the rate performance of materials, and (2) the rational combination of porous carbon and RGO is an effective way for designing advanced materials for capacitors.

The good performance of LPCG-2-600 should be relative to the following factors: high specific areas, N doping and rational combination of RGO and porous carbon. Although RGO has good conductivity for easy charge-transfer, it only has a low surface area of 294 m2 g−1 that is not conducive to the ion adsorption and transfer. Meanwhile, PC-600 has poor conductivity due to the presence of RGO although it possesses a high specific surface area. As a result, PC-600 and RGO-600 give lower capacitance than LPCG-based samples. Among the LPCG-based samples, LPCG-2-600 possesses suitable ratios of RGO and porous carbon, relatively high surface areas and high N doping. More specifically, LPCG-1-600 has better conductivity than LPCG-2-600 due to the higher ratio of RGO, but it has a lower surface area than the latter. So, the LPCG-1-600 gives a lower discharge capacitance than LPCG-2-600. Whereas for LPCG-3-600, the high ratio of porous carbon would result in the low conductivity of the samples, so it shows low capacitance although it has a high surface area. Therefore, the combination of suitable surface areas and conductivity results in the good capacitance of LPCG-2-600. In addition, we know that N doping can also have some effects on the performance of carbon materials. In all LPCG-based samples, the amount of N doping in LPCG-2-600 is lower compared to LPCG-3-600 and PC-600, but LPCG-2-600 has high capacitance. The low values for LPCG-2-600 (500), LPCG-2-600 (700)) and LPCG-2-500 should be relative to the low SBET specific surface areas. The low capacitance values for LPCG-2-700 are due to the low amount of N doping, which results in losing N components at high temperatures. So, we presume that the combination of N doping, specific area and conductivity factors affects the performance of the materials.
The improvement of RGO on the conductivity is verified by Nyquist plots from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). To elucidate the role of RGO more clearly, the EIS of PC-600, RGO-600 and LPCG-2-600 were also tested. Fig. 8 shows the Nyquist plots of the samples in the frequency range from 10 mHz to 100 KHz in a three-electrode system in 6 M KOH electrolyte. The equivalent circuit is shown in the inset to fit the EIS spectra. A magnified view of the high frequency part is shown in the inset. In the spectra, Rs refers to the combined ohmic resistance of the electrolyte and the internal resistance of the electrode and current collectors. The semicircle impedance in the inset represents the charge-transfer resistance (Rct), and ZW is the Warburg resistance. The semicircle in the high frequency corresponds to the charge-transfer resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface, while the linear relationship in the low frequency region mainly represents pure capacitive behaviour. The almost vertical line of LPCG-2-600 in the low frequency region demonstrates good captive behaviour that can decrease diffusion limitations. The LPCG-2-600 electrode exhibits an Rct value of 0.0894 Ω that is much lower than that of 0.4730 Ω for PC-600, indicating that LPCG-2-600 has a lower contact interface resistance of ions adsorbed/desorbed on the electrode materials. Thus, the EIS results prove that the porous layer-like structure of LPCG-based materials can promote ion and electron transport. These results well coincide with the discharge and CV results, which confirm that LPCG-2-600 has much better electrochemical performance. This result further demonstrates that the introduction of GO into the composites can result in an enhanced electrochemical performance.

Cycling performance is one of the important aspects for the SCs. The performance of LPCG-2-600 was examined by continuous galvanostatic charge/discharge in 6 M KOH at 5 A g−1 and the result is presented in Fig. 7d. The capacitance after 2000 cycles is about 86% of the initial value and the fading rate is only 0.007% per cycle. The columbic efficiency is about 100% after 2000 cycles, which clearly indicates excellent electrochemical stability and promising potential of the LPCG-2-600 materials in energy storage devices.
A two-electrode cell test was carried out in 6 M KOH with one piece of cellulose paper as the separator. Fig. 9a displays the charge–discharge curves of the LPCG-2-600 symmetrical supercapacitor device. The charge–discharge curves of LPCG-2-600 from the CV test are slightly distorted, suggesting the capacitive from the combination of the electrical double-layer and redox reactions from a N heteroatom. The CV measurements were tested at various scan rates of 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 mV s−1. As expected, the voltage can reach 1.0 V in aqueous electrolytes. CVs of LPCG-2-600 exhibit quasi-rectangular shapes at low scan rates. When the scan rate is increased to 200 mV s−1, the CV curves show a slight deformation, suggesting the good rate performance of LPCG-2-600 in aqueous electrolytes, which is in congruence with the charge–discharge test of a three-electrode system (Fig. 9b). The specific capacitance of LPCG-2-600 supercapacitor cells is 67 F g−1 (6 M, KOH) at current density 1 A g−1. The Ragone plots of LPCG-2-600 corresponding to the relationship between energy and power densities are shown in Fig. 9c. Generally, the energy density E = 1/2CV2 and the power density PE/t are two important parameters for the practical application of supercapacitors. They are relative to the specific capacitance (C), the discharging voltage (V) and the discharging time (t). An energy density of 9.32 W h kg−1 can be reached at a relatively low power density of 500 W kg−1, and it still maintains 6.13 W h kg−1 at a high power density of 10.5 kW kg−1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte. The excellent performance of LPCG-2-600 could be ascribed to the porous nanosheet structure and good conductivity of RGO. The stability of the supercapacitor device using LPCG-2-600 as an electrode material is shown in Fig. 9d. The specific capacitance remained 96.4% of its initial value after 5000 cycles (Fig. 9d). The results further demonstrate that LPCG-2-600 is an excellent electrode material for supercapacitors.

4. Conclusions
In summary, stacked layer-like porous carbon containing RGO was constructed based on the GO-induced assembly of gelatin. LPCG combines the advantages of the large specific areas of porous carbon and the good conductivity of RGO, thus resulting in good ability for rapid charge-transfer, diffusion, and fast transfer-charge. The above characteristics make the LPCG a suitable material for supercapacitors. The material exhibited a high specific capacitance (366 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), good rate capability (221 F g−1 at density 30 A g−1) and good cycling stability. It also showed a high energy density of 9.32 W h kg−1 at a relatively low power density of 500 W kg−1. The work demonstrates that the rational combination of RGO and porous carbon is essential for improving the capacitance performance of the carbon materials. We have also found that a high conductivity is favourable for improving the rate performance of the materials. The LPCG-based materials have large potential for applications in energy storage and conversion devices.
