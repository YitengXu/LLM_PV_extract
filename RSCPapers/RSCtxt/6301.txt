    , Accepted 10th October 2022First published on 10th October 2022AbstractLithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries have been regarded as potential next-generation batteries owing to their ultrahigh theoretical capacity and abundance of sulfur. However, polysulfide shuttling, poor electronic conductivity, and severe volume expansion limit their commercial prospects. In this work, we rationally constructed a 3D porous Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8 heterostructure derived from a zeolite imidazole framework (ZIF)/Ti3C2Tx MXene composite via carbonization and subsequent sulfidation. In this 3D porous Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8 heterostructure, the 3D porous Ti3C2Tx MXene structure can provide facilitated ion and electron transport, good structural stability, and polar bonds to anchor sulfur and polysulfides. The formed CNTs can enhance ion diffusion and electron transport. The Co9S8 nanoparticles can accelerate the conversion reaction of polysulfides to Li2S, which can further prevent polysulfide shuttling. The 3D porous structure can buffer the electrode volume change upon cycling. This rationally designed Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S cathode exhibits a high initial capacity of 1389.8 mA h g−1 at 0.1C, good cyclic stability (730.7 mA h g−1 at 0.2C after 100 cycles), and excellent rate capacities (530.7 mA h g−1 at 1C). When the S loading was 2.5 mg cm−2, the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S cathode still exhibited a reversible capacity of 472.8 mA h g−1 at 0.5C after 300 cycles.
1. Introduction
The massive use of fossil fuels has caused many environmental problems, which are receiving increasing attention. It is important to develop novel energy storage devices for the stable and efficient use of clean energy sources, including solar, wind, and geothermal energy.1,2 Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have occupied an important position in the market and numerous application areas in the past few decades.3–5 However, the energy density of LIBs cannot meet the increasing requirements for electric vehicles and large energy storage devices.6 Therefore, developing novel alternative batteries with high power and energy density is urgently necessary.
Among various alternative batteries, lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries are promising next-generation batteries owing to their high energy density (2567 W h kg−1), high theoretical specific capacity (1675 mA h g−1), low price, and environmental friendliness. However, Li–S batteries suffer from poor conductivity of sulfur and intermediate polysulfides, polysulfide shuttling, and huge electrode volume expansion upon cycling.7–9 To solve these problems, one effective approach is to design appropriate S host materials.10 Carbon materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have excellent electronic conductivity (102–106 S cm−1) and good mechanical/chemical stability. Constructing a conductive network from CNTs can improve the electronic conductivity and buffer the electrode expansion upon cycling.11 Carbon materials could confine sulfur species and polysulfides via physical interaction between carbon materials and polysulfides.12 However, these sulfur/carbon composite cathodes always show poor cycling performance at high S loadings. The physical interaction between polysulfides and non-polar carbon materials is too weak to suppress the polysulfide shuttling.13,14
Therefore, it is an effective strategy to construct a Li–S cathode from polar and porous materials, providing strong chemical/physical adsorption of polysulfides and sulfur. To date, plenty of polar materials such as heteroatom-doped carbon, metal oxides, and metal sulfides have been developed as efficient S hosts for Li–S batteries.15–18 Furthermore, functional catalytic materials such as metal sulfides, phosphides, and nitrides can facilitate the conversion reaction of polysulfide to Li2S.19–24 For example, Co9S8 with excellent electrocatalytic properties can effectively chemically adsorb polysulfides and promote the conversion of polysulfides.25–27 Yu et al. fabricated a heterostructure composed of Co9S8 nanoparticles embedded in an N-doped carbon nanotube hollow polyhedron as a Li–S battery cathode.28 Co9S8 nanoparticles could accelerate the redox reaction kinetics and inhibit polysulfide shuttling, leading to high capacity and excellent cyclic stability.
MXenes, novel types of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, are usually fabricated by selectively etching the A atomic layer in the MAX phase, where M is the transition metal, A is III or IV group elements, and X is carbon or nitrogen.29–31 The 2D MXene materials have potential applications in energy storage, catalysis, water treatment, electromagnetic shielding, and antibacterial activities.32–37 Due to their excellent electronic conductivity (∼104 S cm−1), outstanding cyclic stability, highly 2D polar structure, and abundant surface functional groups (–O, –OH, and –F), MXenes are promising hosts to encapsulate the S species for Li–S batteries.38,39 However, 2D MXene sheets are prone to stacking and structure collapse, resulting in reduced active sites, slow ion diffusion, and low sulfur utilization. Some strategies such as constructing 1D/2D nanostructures, 2D/2D nanostructures, and 3D porous structures have been utilized to prevent the MXene sheets from stacking.40–43
In this work, we rationally designed a 3D porous Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8 heterostructure derived from a zeolite imidazole framework (ZIF)/Ti3C2Tx MXene composite via carbonization and subsequent sulfidation. After the carbonization treatment of ZIF/Ti3C2Tx MXene composites in an argon atmosphere, plenty of CNTs were in situ grown on the porous Ti3C2Tx MXene via co-catalysis of the melamine. The Co nanoparticles encapsulated on the top of CNTs were further converted into Co9S8 nanoparticles during the sulfidation process, forming a 3D Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8 heterostructure. In the 3D porous Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8 heterostructure, the 3D porous Ti3C2Tx structure can provide quick ion/electron transport, good structural stability, and polar bond to anchor the sulfur and polysulfides. Besides, the in situ formed CNTs can further enhance ion diffusion and electron transport. The Co9S8 nanoparticles can accelerate the conversion reaction of polysulfides to Li2S, further preventing polysulfide shuttling. In addition, the 3D porous structure can buffer the electrode volume change upon cycling. As a result, this rationally designed Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S cathode exhibits excellent electrochemical properties including a high initial capacity of 1389.8 mA h g−1 at 0.1C, good cyclic stability (730.7 mA h g−1 at 0.2C after 100 cycles), excellent rate capacities (530.7 mA h g−1 at 1C), small capacity decay (capacity fade of 0.057% per cycle after 500 cycles at 1C), and a high areal S loading of 70.1 wt%. Therefore, constructing 3D porous Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8 is an effective strategy to improve sulfur utilization and inhibit polysulfide shuttling via the synergistic effect of physical encapsulation/chemical adsorption/catalytic conversion in Li–S batteries.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Material synthesis

Synthesis of Ti3C2Tx MXene solution. 
In a typical experiment, 2.0 g of Ti3AlC2 powder was added to 40 mL of HCl (9 M) solution and 2.0 g of LiF under stirring at 45 °C for 36 h to etch Al atoms from Ti3AlC2. Then, the solution was washed with deionized water until the pH value reached 6~7. The product was dispersed in 50 mL of deionized water and exfoliated by ultrasonication for 2 h. Finally, the upper suspension was obtained by centrifugation at 10000 rpm to obtain the few-layer Ti3C2Tx MXene solution.


Synthesis of ZIF-67 nano polyhedron. 
Typically, 5 mmol Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 20 mmol 2-methylimidazole were added to 50 mL of methanol under stirring for 30 min. This mixture solution was placed at room temperature for 3 h. The product was washed with methanol, centrifuged, and heated in a vacuum oven at 70 °C to obtain the ZIF-67 powder.


Synthesis of 3D porous Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8. 
First, 100 mg of ZIF-67 powder was added to 20 mL of 5 mg mL−1 Ti3C2Tx MXene solution under stirring. Then, 800 mg of melamine was added to the above solution under stirring. Subsequently, the obtained mixture was vacuum filtered and freeze-dried. The obtained powder was calcined at 700 °C for 2 h in an Ar atmosphere to get a 3D porous Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co sample. Finally, Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co was treated with a sublimated sulfur powder in a ratio of 1:10 at 350 °C in an Ar/H2 atmosphere for 2 h to obtain 3D porous Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8 heterostructures.


Fabrication of Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S composites. 
First, 20 mg of 3D porous Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8 powder was ground with 80 mg of sublimated sulfur for 30 min and mounted in a Teflon-lined autoclave filled with Ar gas. Then, the mixed powder was heated at 155 °C for 12 h to obtain a Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S composite. The Ti3C2Tx/S composite was prepared using Ti3C2Tx sheets as S hosts via the same route at 155 °C.

3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 illustrates the synthesis of 3D porous Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8. First, few-layer Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets were synthesized by etching Ti3AlC2 with HF acid followed by ultrasonic exfoliation. Meanwhile, the ZIF-67 nanoparticles were prepared via a solution reaction. Afterward, the Ti3C2Tx MXene colloidal solution, ZIF-67, and melamine were mixed and vacuum filtered. During the heating process, the CNTs were in situ grown on MXene sheets due to the catalysis of Co nanoparticles. Then, a Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8 heterostructure was obtained via sulfidation of the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co structure. Finally, the pre-prepared Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8 heterostructure was utilized as the S host to prepare a 3D porous Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S cathode in an Ar/H2 atmosphere.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the synthesis of the Ti3C2Tx MXene and 3D porous Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8 heterostructure. 

Fig. 2a shows the XRD patterns of the Ti3C2Tx MXene, 3D porous Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8, and Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S composites. For the Ti3C2Tx MXene, the peak at 7.7° corresponds to the (002) plane of Ti3C2Tx, indicating the successful preparation of Ti3C2Tx MXene.44 For the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8 heterostructure, the unsharp peak at 20° could be ascribed to the CNTs, while the other peaks at 15.5, 29.8, 31.2, 36.1, 47.6, and 52.1° correspond to the (111), (311), (222), (400), (511), and (440) planes of the Co9S8 phase (PDF no. 86-2273).45 The characteristic peak of the Ti3C2Tx (002) plane is not obvious because of poor crystallinity and low content of MXenes. Furthermore, the peak at 23.1° of the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S composite indicates the successful loading of S (PDF no. 08-0247) on the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8 host. In Fig. 2b, the Ti3C2Tx MXene demonstrates a typical accordion-like structure.46 From the SEM image shown in Fig. 2c, the Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheet displays a width of ∼4 μm. As shown in Fig. 2d and e, the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8 heterostructure demonstrates a 3D porous network composed of few-layer Ti3C2Tx MXenes, CNTs, and Co nanoparticles. Via heating and carbonization of the Ti3C2Tx/ZIF-67 precursor, some CNTs were formed from ZIF-67 and melamine due to the catalysis of Co nanoparticles. Besides, the Co9S8 nanoparticles are encapsulated on top of the CNTs (Fig. 2f).

Fig. 3 depicts the TEM images of the 3D porous Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8 heterostructure. The Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8 heterostructure is composed of Ti3C2Tx nanosheets (marked as green circle), Co9S8 nanoparticles (blue circle), and CNTs (red circle). In the TEM images (Fig. 3c and d), the Co9S8 nanoparticles (∼20 nm) are encapsulated on top of the crimped CNTs. The crimpled CNTs are connected to the wrinkled MXene sheets. The HRTEM image in Fig. 3e confirms the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs/Co9S8 interface in the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8 heterostructure. The layer typical lattice fringes of the folded MXene sheets indicate the few-layer sheet structure (Fig. 3f). The layer distance of the folded MXene sheets is ∼0.34 nm. In Fig. 3g, the lattice distance of Co9S8 nanoparticles is ∼0.245 nm, corresponding to the Co9S8 (400) plane. Fig. 3h displays the crimpled CNTs with a lattice spacing of 0.359 nm. Furthermore, the TEM-EDS mapping (Fig. 3i–n) images demonstrate that the Ti, C, N, Co, and S elements are uniformly distributed in the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8 heterostructure.

The XPS technique was utilized to test the element composition and valence information. Fig. 4a confirms the existence of C, Ti, S, Co, and N elements in the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8 composite. In the Ti spectrum (Fig. 4b), the peaks at 471.3, 463.9, 460.9, 458.1, 456.3, and 454.9 eV could be ascribed to Ti–O 2p1/2, Ti–N 2p1/2, Ti–C 2p1/2, Ti–O 2p3/2, Ti–N 2p3/2, and Ti–C 2p3/2,47,48 respectively. Ti–O belongs to the inevitable partial oxidation on the Ti3C2Tx MXene surface. Ti–C is from Ti3C2Tx, while Ti–N could be ascribed to the imidazole organic ligand in ZIF-67 containing the N element. In the C spectrum (Fig. 4c), the four peaks at 287.49, 285.19, 283.94, and 281.19 eV could be assigned to C–N, C–O, C–C, and Ti–C bonds in the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8 heterostructure. In the S spectrum (Fig. 4d), four peaks centered at 168.3, 163.6, 162.8, and 161.6 eV correspond to SO42−, S 2p3/2, C–S–C, and S 2p1/2. The C–S–C bond could be attributed to the interaction of Co9S8 with Ti3C2Tx MXenes and CNTs. In the Co spectrum (Fig. 4e), the peaks at 796.8, 793.4, 780.5, and 778.4 eV could be attributed to Co2+ 2p1/2, Co3+ 2p1/2, Co2+ 2p3/2, and Co3+ 2p3/2, while the peaks at 802.8 and 785.4 eV are satellite peaks. The N spectrum in Fig. 4f displays four peaks at 395.8, 398.1, 399.8, and 401.3 eV, which could be ascribed to Ti–N, pyridine N, pyrrolic N, and graphitic N. The N-doping can effectively improve the conductivity of the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8 heterostructure.49,50

Fig. S1a† shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8 heterostructure and pure Ti3C2Tx MXene. The pure Ti3C2Tx MXene displays a smaller specific surface area of 11.30 m2 g−1 and a pore volume of 0.025 cm3 g−1. The 3D porous Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8 composite demonstrates a larger specific surface area of 67.98 m2 g−1 and a pore volume of 0.144 cm3 g−1 with a pore distribution of ∼2 nm (Fig. S1b†). Therefore, the porous Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8 structure can provide high electronic conductivity, quick ion diffusion, and abundant active sites for effective physical and chemical adsorption of sulfur and polysulfide. The porous Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8 structure can also buffer the electrode volume expansion upon cycling. Besides, the S content of the 3D Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S cathode was measured to be 70.1 wt% through the TGA technique (Fig. S2a†), while the S content of the Ti3C2Tx/S cathode was 64 wt% (Fig. S2b†). The Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8 structure can be beneficial to the S loading.
The synthesized Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S composite was used as the cathode of Li–S batteries. The Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S cathode demonstrated an S loading of 0.8 mg cm−2 and a thickness of ∼14 μm (Fig. S3†). To investigate the electrochemical properties of the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S cathode (Fig. S4†), the cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were performed at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 between 1.5 and 3.0 V. In Fig. 5a, there are three obvious peaks at 2.02, 2.30, and 2.46 V in the first scan. The two reduction peaks at 2.02 and 2.30 V could be ascribed to the sulfur reduction to long-chain and short-chain polysulfides, respectively. Then, the peak at 2.46 V reflects the oxidation of short-chain polysulfides to monomeric sulfur, which is in good agreement with the CV results reported in the literature.51 In the following 2nd and 3rd CV curves, the reduction and oxidation peaks almost remain unchanged, indicating the good structural stability of the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S heterostructure cathode. In Fig. 5b, the pure Ti3C2Tx/S cathode also shows two reduction peaks and one oxidation peak. However, the oxidation peak potential of the pure Ti3C2Tx/S electrode (∼2.50 V) is higher than that of Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S. In comparison, the reduction peak potentials (1.98 and 2.26 V) of the pure Ti3C2Tx/S electrode are lower than those of the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S electrode, indicating the facilitated electrochemical reaction kinetics of the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S electrode and effective polysulfide conversion.

(c) Charge–discharge curves of the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S cathode at different current densities from 0.1 to 2C. (d) Comparison of the charge and discharge curves of the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S and Ti3C2Tx/S cathodes. 

Fig. 5c depicts the charge–discharge curves of the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S cathode at current densities from 0.1 to 2C (1C = 1675 mA g−1). There are two obvious discharge plateaus (∼2.20 and 2.05 V) and one charge plateau (∼2.30 V) in the curves at 0.1C, which is in good agreement with the above-mentioned CV result. When the current density increases from 0.1 to 2C, the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S cathode maintains two discharge plateaus and one charge plateau, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5d, both discharge curves of the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S and Ti3C2Tx/S cathodes possess two distinct plateaus at 0.2C. The overpotential of the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S cathode is lower than that of the Ti3C2Tx/S cathode, indicating the smaller polarization and faster redox reaction kinetics.52

Fig. 6a shows the rate performance of the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S and Ti3C2Tx/S cathodes at different rates from 0.1 to 2C. The Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S cathode demonstrates initial discharge and charge capacities of 1389.8 and 1221.4 mA h g−1 at 0.1C, respectively. As a comparison, the Ti3C2Tx/S cathode possesses initial discharge and charge capacities of 1003.8 and 942.7 mA h g−1, respectively. Furthermore, when discharged at 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 and 2.0C, the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S cathode demonstrates capacities of 780.9, 668.2, 615.6, 581.5, 538.3, 510.0 and 419.6 mA h g−1. When the current density is reduced to 0.2C, the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S cathode maintains a capacity of 662 mA h g−1. In contrast, the Ti3C2Tx/S cathode shows capacities of 189, 138, 112.1, 97.9, 79.2, 61.3, and 21.5 mA h g−1 at current densities of 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, and 2.0C. When the current density returns to 0.2C, the Ti3C2Tx/S cathode possesses a capacity of 135 mA h g−1. The 3D porous Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8 can improve sulfur utilization. The 3D conductive network composed of CNTs and Ti3C2 can increase the electronic conductivity and provide more ion transport channels.

(d) Long-term cycling performance at 0.5C with a high S loading of 2.5 mg cm−2; the inset figure is a Li–S coin cell powering an LED lamp. 

Fig. 6b depicts the cycling performance of the 3D porous Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S and Ti3C2Tx/S cathodes at 0.2C. The Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S cathode possesses initial discharge and charge capacities of 1121.1 and 1084.4 mA h g−1, leading to an initial coulombic efficiency of 96.7%. In contrast, the Ti3C2Tx/S electrode has an initial discharge and charge capacities of 662.5 and 648 mA h g−1. Furthermore, the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S cathode maintains a capacity of 730.7 mA h g−1 and 65.2% capacity retention after 100 cycles, while the Ti3C2Tx/S cathode maintains a capacity of 166.4 mA h g−1 and 25.1% capacity retention after 100 cycles. Moreover, when the current density increases to 1.0C (Fig. 6c), the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S cathode demonstrates a capacity of 444.2 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles with a small capacity decay of 0.057% per cycle. The Ti3C2Tx/S cathode possesses a capacity of 269.8 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles. Generally, the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S cathode shows better electrochemical performance than that of the Ti3C2Tx/S cathode and other MXene- and Co9S8-based cathodes.25,26,53–57Fig. 6d shows the long-term cycling performance with a high S loading of 2.5 mg cm−2 at 0.5C. The Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S-2.5 cathode maintains a reversible capacity of 472.8 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles. Furthermore, one Li–S coin cell based on the hierarchical Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S cathode can easily power a light-emitting diode (LED) lamp (Fig. 6d inset).
The huge volume change of the cathode upon cycling can cause the collapse and falling of the cathode material, leading to irreversible capacity decay. From the optical pictures of Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S (Fig. S4†), the electrode material well adheres to the collector after 200 cycles. To further study the structural stability of the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S heterostructure cathode, the cathode (after 200 cycles) was immersed and washed with a DME solvent.58 In Fig. S5a and b,† the cathode does not suffer from severe pulverization, indicating that the 3D porous structure can effectively alleviate the volume expansion. The Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S electrode was also characterized by the XPS technique (Fig. S6†). Compared to the fresh Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S electrode before cycling, the overall binding energies of the Ti 2p peaks in the cycled Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S electrode decreased, while a new peak of Ti–S bond at 455.65 eV was observed (Fig. 4b and Fig. S6a†), which could be attributed to the chemical reaction between the electrode material and polysulfides.59 The S 2p spectrum (Fig. S6b†) contains four doublet peaks, terminal S (ST, 162.0 eV), bridging S (SB, 162.9 eV), thiosulfate (166.4 eV), and polythionate complexes (168.0 eV). The thiosulfate and polythionate could be attributed to the redox reaction between Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8 and polysulfides.
EIS technique was utilized to deeply study the electrochemical behavior of the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S heterostructure cathode. Fig. S7a† shows the EIS spectra of the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S and Ti3C2Tx/S cathodes. The semicircular region in the high-frequency region reflects the interfacial charge transfer impedance (38.9 Ω) of the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S cathode. In contrast, the interfacial charge transfer impedance of the Ti3C2Tx/S cathode is 105.9 Ω. The Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S cathode has a faster charge transfer rate at the electrode/electrolyte interface. In the low-frequency region, the linear slope of the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S cathode is larger than that of the Ti3C2Tx/S cathode, indicating the faster Li+ transport of Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S cathode. Fig. S7b and c† show the ex situ EIS spectra of the hierarchical 3D porous Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S cathode at different voltage states during the discharging and charging processes. The interfacial charge transfer impedance of the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S cathode at 1.5 and 1.6 V is bigger than that at 1.8 and 2.0 V during the discharge process. In the following charge process, the interfacial charge transfer impedance at 1.7 V is bigger than that at 2.2, 2.6, and 2.8 V. It is because the electronic conductivity of the polysulfide formed at a potential below 2.1 V is relatively low.
The polysulfide (e.g., Li2S6) adsorption capacity of the electrode material in the mixed DOL/DME solvent was verified by a visual inspection method, as shown in Fig. 7a. The 3D porous Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8 composite can entirely decolorize the Li2S6 solution. As a comparison, the Ti3C2Tx MXene only lightens the solution color. These results indicate that the 3D porous Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8 can effectively restrain the polysulfide shuttling. Fig. 7b illustrates the schematic mechanism of the polysulfides’ adsorption and conversion reaction on the 3D porous Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8. In the 3D porous Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8 heterostructure, the porous structure and abundant functional groups can firmly adsorb the polysulfides, while Co9S8 can catalyze the conversion of polysulfides to Li2S.60,61 These results confirm that the 3D porous Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8 heterostructure can expose more active sites and effectively buffer the electrode volume expansion effect upon cycling, which is beneficial for better sulfur utilization. The Ti3C2Tx and CNTs can improve the conductivity and physically/chemically adsorb the polysulfide, while the Co9S8 nanoparticles can catalyze the conversion of polysulfides to Li2S, leading to high capacity, excellent rate capability, and good cyclic stability.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have designed and prepared a 3D porous Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8 heterostructure as a sulfur host for Li–S batteries. In this heterostructure, 3D porous Ti3C2Tx MXenes can expose more active sites, increase the conductivity, relieve the MXene nanosheet stacking, and buffer the electrode volume expansion upon cycling. Besides, Ti3C2Tx and CNTs can improve the conductivity and physically/chemically adsorb the polysulfide, while the Co9S8 nanoparticles can catalyze the conversion of polysulfides to Li2S, making this Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8 heterostructure a promising sulfur host. Therefore, this Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-Co9S8/S cathode exhibits high capacity and good cyclic stability, especially in the case of high sulfur loadings. This work provides a strategy to prepare an excellent Li–S battery cathode with a synergistic interaction between the complexes, physical adsorption, chemical adsorption, and catalytic conversion to prevent polysulfide shuttling.
