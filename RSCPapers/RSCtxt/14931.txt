    , Accepted 10th April 2021First published on 12th April 2021AbstractFixed-polarity unitized regenerative fuel cells (FP-URFCs) are devices for energy conversion coupled with fuel production with low self-discharge, high energy densities, fast start-up/shut down dynamics, and long cycle-life. We have synthesized a bifunctional Pt–IrO2/RTO (ruthenium–titanium mixed oxide) electrocatalyst for the HOR/OER (hydrogen oxidation reaction/oxygen evolution reaction) wherein IrO2/RTO acts as an OER electrocatalyst, upon which the HOR active Pt electrocatalyst is deposited. Pt–IrO2/RTO shows higher OER (η@10 mA cm−2 = 0.26 ± 0.01 V, i = 67 ± 1.9 mA cm−2 at η = 0.32 V) and HOR (η@2.5 mA cm−2 = 0.01 V, i = 2.78 ± 0.11 mA cm−2 at η = 0.1 V) activity and higher stability in comparison to benchmark OER (RuO2, η@10 mA cm−2 = 0.42 ± 0.03 V, i = 3.1 ± 0.2 mA cm−2 at η = 0.32 V and IrO2, η@10 mA cm−2 = 0.33 ± 0.02 V, i = 10.2 ± 0.2 mA cm−2 at η = 0.32 V) and HOR (Pt/C, η@2.5 mA cm−2 = 0.05 V, i = 2.58 ± 0.08 mA cm−2 at 0.1 V vs. RHE) electrocatalysts, respectively. Pt–IrO2/RTO exhibits higher bifunctional HOR/OER activity as compared to both IrO2/RTO and RTO, which is achieved through a combined effect of enhanced active site density and favorable electronic interactions (increased metal oxidation states of Ru and Ir) as confirmed by XPS and UPS. The deposition of IrO2 in Pt–IrO2/RTO is responsible for high stability by lowering the dissolution of the RTO support, as confirmed by ICP-MS. A FP-URFC tested with Pt–IrO2/RTO and Pt/C as the anode and cathode, respectively yields a mass-specific activity of 1050 ± 22 A g−1 at 1.8 V and 20 ± 2 A g−1 at 0.9 V under electrolyzer and fuel cell modes, respectively. The FP-URFC shows a round-trip efficiency of 40.2% at 1 A cm−2 with low Pt-loading on both electrodes. Therefore, FP-URFCs using Pt–IrO2/RTO as the HOR/OER bifunctional electrocatalyst have significant potential towards efficient and cost-effective bidirectional energy and fuel production.
Introduction
Energy storage has gained increased attention for flexible electrical grid operation as conventional constant and variable energy sources converge on the electrical grid.1 Wind and solar energy are not suitable on a stand-alone basis to meet consumer requirements due to their intermittency, necessitating proper energy storage. Hydrogen is a promising energy carrier due to its high energy density (120–142 MJ kg−1) and can be produced via water splitting in an electrolyzer using an external power source.2–4 Electrolyzers can be used to convert excess energy produced via fossil fuel combustion (i.e. off-peak production) as well as from renewable energy sources to H2, which can then be utilized as and when needed. A fuel cell utilizes hydrogen as a fuel and oxygen/air as an oxidant to produce electricity and water. A regenerative fuel cell (RFC) composed of an electrolyzer and fuel cell is an energy conversion/storage device which offers certain advantages over rechargeable batteries such as low self-discharge, high energy densities (1.0–3.66 kW h kg−1), fast start-up/shut down, and long duration/lifetime.5–8 Until now, RFCs have been mainly conceptualized/used for unmanned underwater and air vehicles, off-grid power storage systems, and emergency power generators where the fuel, oxidant and reaction product (i.e. water) are stored separately. Unitized regenerative fuel cells (URFCs) combine the functionalities of electrolyzers and fuel cells in a single unit and offer all the advantages of RFCs at lower weight, volume and capital cost, without the requirement of ancillary equipment for an additional cell stack.5–8
Proton exchange membrane-URFCs (PEM-URFCs) have been widely studied for transportation, renewable energy storage, etc. due to their high power densities.5,6 In spite of their advantages, they suffer from (1) high loading of noble metal electrocatalysts9 and (2) low stability due to carbon support corrosion.10 URFCs primarily have two types of configurations: (1) fixed gas (FG-URFC) wherein the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occur at one of the electrodes whereas the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) occur at the other electrode and (2) fixed polarity (FP-URFC) wherein oxidation reactions such as OER and HOR occur at the same electrode, which are complemented by HER or ORR occurring at the other electrode.11 The FG-URFC has the advantages of easy gas management with no mixing of H2 and O2, and fast switching between the charge and discharge mode. The disadvantage of the FG-URFC is that the kinetically sluggish oxygen electrochemical reactions (ORR and OER) are on the same side of the cell resulting in a convergence of inefficiencies. On the other hand, FP-URFC operation does not require polarity switching. The FP-URFC has the advantage of permitting the engineering of better electrocatalysts for kinetically sluggish reactions (i.e. OER and ORR), as in the reverse mode the electrode only needs to catalyze kinetically facile reactions (i.e. HOR and HER). This results in higher current densities for FP-URFCs.7,12 The choice of electrocatalysts for URFCs is governed by the need for bifunctional activity. Hydrogen production using FP-URFCs in the water electrolyzer (WE) mode using the Pt/C electrocatalyst is limited in efficacy due to the sluggish OER kinetics on Pt/C in acidic media.13 To develop high performance FP-URFCs, a highly active and stable HOR/OER bifunctional electrocatalyst is therefore required, as commercial Pt/C does not serve as a reasonable OER catalyst (though Pt/C serves perfectly well as an ORR/HER catalyst).13 Though Pt/C is a benchmark catalyst for the HOR,14,15 the application of commercial Pt/C in PEM-URFCs suffers from the need for high Pt loading and from poor long-term stability due to carbon support corrosion.9,16 Though RuO2 has been considered as a benchmark OER electrocatalyst, its activity and stability in acidic medium drops rapidly due to the formation (dissolution and passivation) of higher valent oxides.17–21 IrO2 shows comparable OER activity and higher stability as compared to RuO2 in acidic medium and has been considered as another benchmark OER catalyst.22 In spite of their high OER activity, RuO2 and IrO2 do not show HOR activity due to weak hydrogen binding and coverage on the catalyst surface.23 The consequent poor HOR activity makes them unsuitable as HOR/OER bifunctional electrocatalysts. Researchers have developed different OER/ORR electrocatalysts (e.g. Pt–Ir,24 Pt–IrO2,25–28 Pt–Ru–Ir,29 Pt–RuO2 (ref. 30) and Pt–RuO2–IrO2 (ref. 30)) as well as HOR/OER (Pt–Ir/C,7 Pt–Ir/TiC12,31) bifunctional electrocatalysts for their use in URFCs by mixing two different electrocatalysts. For the aforementioned electrocatalysts, the resultant URFCs show high current densities both in fuel cell and electrolyzer modes with high PGM-catalyst loading (1.2–4.0 mg cm−2) (PGM = Pt-group metals).12 However, the use of Pt–IrO2 with low Pt and Ir loadings as a HOR/OER bifunctional electrocatalyst for FP-URFCs has not been studied yet and is the focus of this study.
The electrocatalyst support plays a critical role in increasing electrocatalytic activity through electrocatalyst–support interactions,32 by enabling a decrease in the noble metal loading,33 by providing a high surface area through efficient catalyst dispersion,34 by increasing the bulk electrical conductivity32,34 and by facilitating mass transport of reactants and products. Carbon is widely used as an electrocatalyst support since it has a high surface area and high bulk electrical conductivity.34 However, carbon is highly susceptible to corrosion under high applied potentials which cannot be avoided in the OER mode, thereby reducing the activity as well as stability of carbon-supported electrocatalysts.9 Metal oxides have been used as electrocatalyst supports to increase the stability of the supported electrocatalyst.35–38 Electrocatalyst supports such as TiC,31 ATO,35 doped-TiO2,36,37 and TinO2n−1 (ref. 38) have been extensively studied as they offer moderate to high conductivity, moderate surface area and enhanced mass transfer. Sub-stoichiometric TiO2 (TinO2n−1) has been widely used as a catalyst support, as it is highly conductive (conductivity of 500–1000 S m−1) due to the presence of O-vacancies.38–40 However, the sub-stoichiometric metal oxides offer a low surface area (1.7 m2 g−1) and also undergo degradation under strong oxidizing or reducing environments.41 Another oxide material, RuO2–TiO2 (RTO) has a good surface area (33 m2 g−1), electrical conductivity (65 S m−1), high OER activity and high stability, and has been successfully demonstrated to be corrosion-resistant in fuel cell applications.18,42–45 The use of Pt–IrO2 with low Pt and Ir loadings on the RTO support as an anode for FP-URFCs is yet to be studied, which is the focus of our study.
In this work, we have synthesized Pt–IrO2/RTO as a highly active and stable HOR/OER bifunctional electrocatalyst for FP-URFC applications. The RTO support is prepared using a wet-chemical synthesis method.42 IrO2/RTO is prepared by depositing IrO2 on the RTO support via the wet-chemical synthesis method followed by Pt deposition using a colloidal method to form Pt–IrO2/RTO. RTO on its own shows higher OER activity and stability as compared to benchmark RuO2 due to strong TiO2 and RuO2 interactions.46 IrO2/RTO exhibits higher OER activity and stability as compared to RTO due to the deposition of OER-active IrO2 leading to low dissolution of the RTO support which is confirmed from inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) studies. Pt is deposited on IrO2/RTO to achieve Pt–IrO2/RTO which shows much higher HOR as well as equivalent OER activity and stability as compared to both IrO2/RTO and RTO. Pt–IrO2/RTO also exhibits higher OER and HOR activity and stability in comparison to benchmark OER (RuO2 and IrO2) and HOR (Pt/C) electrocatalysts, respectively. Membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) are prepared using Pt–IrO2/RTO and Pt/C as anode and cathode catalysts, respectively, in a FP-URFC. The FP-URFC is tested under both electrolyzer and fuel cell modes using a proton exchange membrane separator, showing excellent URFC performance with a good round-trip efficiency (RTE). The low Pt and Ir content in Pt–IrO2/RTO (compared to commercial Pt/C) also decreases the overall cost (Pt–IrO2/RTO = $282/Oz vs. commercial Pt/C = $465/Oz) without sacrificing the high URFC performance.
Experimental
Synthesis of the RTO support
1 g of titania (TiO2, Sigma Aldrich) is dispersed in 250 ml deionized water (DI H2O) and sonicated for 30 min. 7.26 g ruthenium chloride hydrate (RuCl3·xH2O, Sigma Aldrich) is added to the mixture under stirring for 30 min. 0.5 M potassium hydroxide (KOH) (aq.) is added dropwise into the mixture under stirring until the pH of the solution reaches 3.0. Then 0.1 M KOH (aq.) is slowly added to the mixture under stirring to achieve a solution pH of 7.0. The resultant solid material is filtered and thoroughly washed with DI water (2–4 l). The filtered material is dried in an oven at 60 °C overnight, and the dried particles are ground to obtain fine powder with a Ru to Ti mol/atomic ratio of 2:1. Afterward, the finely ground powder is annealed in a tube furnace under air to dehydrate the intermediate species and form RTO. The annealing temperature is increased gradually to 400 °C by applying successively 1 h steps at 250, 350, and 400 °C with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1.
Synthesis of IrO2/RTO
0.5 g RTO is dispersed in 20 ml absolute ethanol (200 proof, Fisher Scientific) and sonicated for 30 min. 0.284 g of iridium chloride hydrate (IrCl3·xH2O, Sigma Aldrich) is added to obtain an initial molar ratio of 1:3 for Ir:Ru. Absolute ethanol is gradually added to obtain a concentration of 0.025 M of metallic Ir. The solution is sonicated for another 30 min to yield a homogeneous solution. Ammonia is added to the solution under vigorous stirring until the pH of the solution reaches 12.0, leading to the growth of suspended particles (clear solution turns turbid). The pH is maintained at 12.0 for 2 h under stirring for the reaction completion and particle formation. The material is separated by centrifugation, filtered out and washed repeatedly with DI water to remove impurities. The material recovered by filtering is dried in an oven at 60 °C followed by grinding in an agate mortar. The resultant material is annealed in a tube furnace in air to yield IrO2/RTO. The annealing temperature is increased gradually to 400 °C by applying successively 1 h steps at 250, 350, and 400 °C with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1.
Preparation of Pt–IrO2/RTO
Synthesis of Pt–IrO2/RTO is performed by slightly modifying a previously reported method.47 0.178 g chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6, 6H2O, Sigma Aldrich) is added to 35 ml of DI water under continuous stirring. 0.71 g sodium bisulphite (NaHSO3) is added to the solution under vigorous stirring until the color turns from yellow to colorless. 88 ml of DI water is added to dilute the solution, followed by the addition of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) buffer to the acidic solution until the pH reaches 5.0. A total of 26 ml hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is then added together with 5 wt% sodium hydroxide (NaOH) according to the following protocol. The addition of H2O2 decreases the pH of the solution rapidly, which is compensated by the addition of NaOH. Initially, H2O2 (2–3 ml) and NaOH are added carefully so that the pH value of the solution is maintained at 5.0 to form the colloidal suspension. After the addition of a certain amount of H2O2, the pH of the solution ceases to decrease, indicating that the reaction is near completion. The rest of the H2O2 is then added to complete the reaction. Then, 0.3 g of IrO2/RTO is added to the solution under stirring for 12 h to facilitate platinum oxide nanoparticle adsorption. The resultant black material is filtered out and washed repeatedly with DI water.
The recovered black particles are dispersed in 100 ml DI water and sonicated followed by the addition of 100 ml absolute ethanol (1:1, vol/vol). Then, the solution is heated at 70 °C for 2 h with stirring for the reduction of platinum oxide nanoparticles deposited on IrO2/RTO. After the solution is cooled down, the particles are filtered and dried overnight at 60 °C to yield Pt–IrO2/RTO.
Physical and electrochemical characterization
We have performed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) for all of the samples whose details are given in the ESI.† The details of electrochemical characterization are also provided in the ESI.†
Preparation of MEA
To prepare the catalyst ink for the membrane electrode assembly (MEA), 0.3 g of the catalyst is placed in a glass vial and wetted with a small amount of DI water. 6 ml of methanol and 1.5 g of 5 wt% Nafion® binder solutions are added subsequently. The suspension is sonicated for 15 minutes before applying to the gas diffusion layer (carbon paper for the cathode and porous titanium plate for the anode) using an airbrush under flowing nitrogen gas. The separator is Nafion-212®. The anode catalyst loading is 1 mg cm−2 of synthesized Pt–IrO2/RTO catalyst, and the cathode catalyst loading is kept at 0.15 mgPt cm−2 of Pt/C (Tananka K.K., 46.5% Pt).
URFC operation
The MEA with an active area of 5 cm2 is tested by electrolyzing preheated ultrapure DI water at 80 °C. The water is pumped into the anode side and recirculated at a flow rate of 20 ml min−1. The cell temperature is also maintained at 80 °C. Polarization curves are obtained by stepping up the current density and holding for 2 min at each current density prior to recording the cell voltage. Fuel cell polarization experiments are performed after conditioning the MEA by holding the cell at a constant voltage of 0.55 V for 90 min to ensure stable operation. The polarization data for the fuel cell is obtained at 80 °C and 90% relative humidity (RH) using H2 as the fuel and O2 as the oxidant without any back pressure (1 atm. absolute gas pressure) on both sides. The anode bipolar plate is a Ti-plate (2 × 2 mm2, single parallel flow channel) whereas the cathode is a graphite plate (1 × 1 mm2, triple serpentine flow channel). The gases are passed at a stoichiometric ratio of 2 with minimum flow maintained at 200 ml min−1. The current is then scanned from open circuit to a value where the cell voltage drops below 0.2 V, with each current density maintained for 2 min. An average of three cell voltage measurements is recorded at each current value.
Results and discussion
Physical characterization
SEM/EDX is used to determine the particle size, elemental (Pt, Ru, Ir, Ti and O) composition and elemental distribution of RTO, IrO2/RTO and Pt–IrO2/RTO (Fig. 1a). A clear distribution of particle size of the above materials cannot be determined using SEM due to its low resolution. Instead, we have used TEM for particle size determination which is discussed later in this section. SEM/EDX of RTO shows an atomic ratio of Ru to Ti as 2.3:1 which is reasonably similar to the precursor ratio (2:1) used during the material synthesis confirming successful RTO preparation. EDX mapping of RTO shows near-uniform Ru and Ti distribution throughout the material without any cluster formation which confirms the effectiveness of the synthesis method for the preparation of a mixed metal oxide support (Fig. 1a). SEM/EDX of IrO2/RTO shows the presence of 9.4 wt% of Ir along with Ru (44 wt%), Ti (9.6 wt%) and O (37 wt%) with uniform distribution and high elemental dispersion confirming successful deposition of IrO2 on RTO (Fig. 1a and Table S1a†). The similar atomic ratio of Ru:Ti (IrO2/RTO = 2.2 and RTO = 2.3) confirms minimal degradation of the RTO support during the IrO2/RTO synthesis. For Pt–IrO2/RTO, a distribution of 4.8, 9.2, 45.2, 10.1 and 30.6 wt% is observed for Pt, Ir, Ru, Ti and O, respectively (Table S1a†). The wt% of Ir and Ru is almost the same for both IrO2/RTO and Pt–IrO2/RTO confirming no loss/degradation of IrO2 during Pt deposition. The atomic/weight ratio (atomic: 2:1, weight: 4.2:1) of Ru to Ti is maintained throughout during the preparation of RTO, IrO2/RTO and Pt–IrO2/RTO suggesting minimal change and high stability of the RTO support during the electrocatalyst preparation. TEM analysis shows that the particle size of RTO is in the range of ∼20 ± 5 nm which is in good agreement with the initial TiO2 particle (Sigma-Aldrich) size (21 nm) (Fig. 1b and S1a†). The result is also in good agreement with previously reported studies.42,43 The TEM image of IrO2/RTO shows small (7 ± 2 nm) IrO2 particles deposited on the RTO support (Fig. 1c and S1b†). The TEM image of Pt–IrO2/RTO shows highly dispersed Pt nanoparticles (4 ± 1 nm) on IrO2/RTO (Fig. 1d and S1c†). The high dispersion of the electrocatalysts (Pt and IrO2) on the support (RTO) is predicted to facilitate high HOR/OER bifunctional activity.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) has been performed on RTO, IrO2/RTO and Pt–IrO2/RTO to identify the presence of different phases (Fig. 2). The XRD peaks of RTO clearly match with rutile phases of both RuO2 (a = b = 4.52 Å, c = 3.14 Å, JCPDS 43-1027) and TiO2 (a = b = 4.67 Å, c = 2.97 Å, JCPDS 21-1276) confirming the presence of pure RuO2 and TiO2. The XRD of RTO does not show any additional peak confirming the absence of any other oxide phases of Ru- and Ti-, which is consistent with the literature.27 The XRD spectrum of IrO2/RTO does not show any discernible additional peak as compared to RTO (Fig. 2). However, some of the peaks become wider, which is ascribed to the overlap of XRD peaks of the rutile phase of RuO2 and IrO2 (a = b = 4.54 Å, c = 3.19 Å, JCPDS 15-0870) having similar phase and lattice constants. For example, major peaks corresponding to the (110), (101), (200) and (211) planes of RuO2 and IrO2 appear and overlap at ∼27–28°, ∼33–34°, ∼38–40°, and ∼52–54°, respectively leading to wider XRD peaks for IrO2/RTO. The contribution of crystallinity to the change in peak sharpness is assumed to be minimal since the annealing of the samples (RTO and IrO2/RTO) is performed at the same temperature (400 °C). XRD of Pt–IrO2/RTO shows the presence of additional peaks associated with metallic Pt (JCPDS 04-0802, (111), (200) and (220) facets at 40°, 47°, and 67°) along with the peaks for IrO2, RuO2 and TiO2 confirming the formation of Pt–IrO2/RTO (Fig. 2). The peaks of RTO and IrO2 in IrO2/RTO and Pt–IrO2/RTO do not shift, indicating the absence of lattice expansion upon Pt-deposition. The result signifies that Pt is not doped in either of the lattice of Ru-, Ti or Ir-oxides and is present only in the metallic state.48 We have not studied the nucleation and crystal growth mechanism of Pt on IrO2/RTO in detail in this study. However, it would be interesting to study them through advanced characterization techniques which will facilitate design of better dispersed Pt nanoparticles that are critical for achieving greater electrocatalytic activity.
 Fig. 2  XRD of RTO, IrO2/RTO and Pt–IrO2/RTO samples. 
The surface elemental composition and oxidation states of the elements are analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). XPS of TiO2 powder shows two considerable peaks for Ti(IV) 2p3/2 and Ti(IV) 2p1/2 at ∼458.7 and ∼464.5 eV, respectively with peak splitting of ∼5.8 eV and a peak area ratio of (Ti(IV) 2p3/2/Ti(IV) 2p1/2) ∼1.3 (Fig. 3a), which is consistent with the literature.46,49,50 For RTO, the deconvolution of the Ti 2p XPS peak shows four sub-peaks at ∼462.3, ∼464.4, ∼459.3 and ∼465.1 eV corresponding to Ru(IV) 3p3/2, Ru(V) 3p3/2, Ti(IV) 2p3/2 and Ti(IV) 2p1/2, respectively which is due to the overlapping of Ru 3p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks with similar binding energies (∼462–465 eV) as reported in the literature (Fig. 3a).46,51,83 For RTO, the peak splitting (∼5.8 eV) and ratio (∼1.3) of Ti(IV) 2p3/2 and Ti(IV) 2p1/2 peaks remain unchanged as compared to pure TiO2. The presence of a single oxidation state of Ti (Ti(IV)) confirms no change in the TiO2 structure during RTO preparation. The result is due to the high stability of TiO2 under RTO mixed metal oxide synthesis conditions. However, a positive shift of ∼0.6 eV is observed for both Ti(IV) 2p3/2 and Ti(IV) 2p1/2 which is attributed to the shifting of the electron-cloud away from Ti due to the deposition of more electronegative Ru(2.2)-oxide as compared to Ti(1.54)-oxide.18,46 RuO2 + TiO2 → RuO2Δ− + TiO2Δ+(1)

The deconvoluted Ru 3d peaks show five peaks at ∼280.8 eV, ∼282.3 eV, ∼284.2 eV, ∼285.2 eV and ∼286.8 eV corresponding to Ru(IV) 3d5/2, Ru(V) 3d5/2, C–C, Ru(IV) 3d3/2 and Ru(V) 3d3/2, respectively (Fig. 3b).18 The presence of the C 1s peak (C–C) is due to the unavoidable contamination of atmospheric carbon which is also found in the literature for Ru 3d peaks.49,52 The peak area ratio of Ru(IV)/Ru(V) for the doublet is similar and in the range of 1.33–1.42, which confirms the absence of any other peak associated with other metal oxide phases and carbonaceous functional groups (e.g. –C–OH, –COOH, –CO etc.).53 The deconvoluted O 1s peak of RTO shows three peaks at ∼529.3 eV, ∼530.5 eV and ∼531.8 eV corresponding to lattice oxygen in Ru(IV)–O, Ti(IV)–O and Ru(V)–O which is in line with literature reports (Fig. 3c).46,51 However, other researchers have also assigned a peak at ∼531.8 eV to the hydroxide species which occurs due to surface adsorption of water molecules by metal oxides.18,46 Therefore, it can be concluded that the appearance of the peak at ∼531.8 eV is the cumulative effect of the presence of both metal hydroxide and Ru(V)–O.
The XPS spectra of IrO2/RTO show similar peaks (Ti 2p, O 1s and Ru 3d) to RTO along with additional peaks corresponding to Ir 4f (Fig. 3d–g). A very small change/shift (<0.05 eV) in Ti 2p peaks (Ti(IV) 2p3/2 ≈ 459.33 eV and Ti(IV) 2p1/2 ≈ 465.15 eV) is observed for IrO2/RTO as compared to RTO, which is due to the same electronegativity of Ir(2.2) and Ru(2.2) (Fig. 3e). Similar Ti(IV) 2p3/2 and Ti(IV) 2p1/2 peak splitting and peak area ratios are observed for both IrO2/RTO and RTO which again confirms the high stability and integrity of the TiO2 phase under the reaction environment for IrO2/RTO preparation. The Ru 3d XPS spectrum of IrO2/RTO also shows a minimal change and similar difference in binding energies (0.05 eV for Ru(IV) 3d5/2, 0.02 eV for Ru(V) 3d5/2, 0.06 eV for Ru(IV) 3d3/2 and 0.07 eV for Ru(V) 3d3/2) to that of Ti 2p peaks (Fig. 3f). The Ru 3d spectrum of IrO2/RTO shows a similar Ru(IV)/Ru(V) ratio (1.34–1.59) to that of RTO confirming the high stability of RTO under the IrO2 deposition environment. The deconvolution of the Ir 4f XPS peak yields four sub-peaks at ∼61.7 eV, ∼62.8 eV, ∼64.7 eV and ∼66.3 eV corresponding to Ir(IV) 4f7/2, Ir(V) 4f7/2, Ir(IV) 4f5/2 and Ir(V) 4f5/2, respectively (Fig. 3d). The Ir 4f spectrum shows peaks for Ir(V) at higher binding energies along with Ir(IV) peaks which is similar to other literature reports.54 The peak separation of (Ir(IV) 4f7/2/Ir(IV) 4f5/2) and (Ir(V) 4f7/2/Ir(V) 4f5/2) is found to be in the range of 3.0–3.2 eV whereas the peak area ratio (Ir(IV) 4f7/2/Ir(V) 4f7/2) and (Ir(IV) 4f5/2/Ir(V) 4f5/2) is calculated in the range of 2.2–2.6. The results confirm the successful deposition of IrO2 on RTO. The deconvoluted O 1s peak of IrO2/RTO also shows three peaks similar to RTO at ∼529.5 eV, ∼530.5 eV and ∼531.7 eV corresponding to the lattice oxygen in Ru(IV)–O, (Ti(IV)–O + Ir(IV)–O) and Ru(V)–O. An increase in peak ratio between the peaks at ∼530.5 eV and ∼529.5 eV is observed for IrO2/RTO as compared to RTO, which is due to the appearance of the O 1s peak of IrO2 along with the O 1s peak of RuO2 at similar binding energy (Fig. 3g).55
The XPS spectra of Pt–IrO2/RTO show the presence of peaks associated with O, Ru, Ti, Ir and Pt (Fig. 3h–l). The deconvolution of the Pt 4f peak yields Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2 with a peak orbital splitting of ∼3.4 eV and peak area ratio of ∼1.5 which matches with previous literature reports.36 The XPS peak of Pt 4f shows the presence of metallic Pt0 (Pt(0) 4f7/2 and Pt(0) 4f5/2 at ∼71.8 and ∼75.2 eV, respectively) with a small amount of platinum oxide (Pt(II) 4f7/2 and Pt(II) 4f5/2 at ∼73.1 and ∼76.7 eV), respectively (Fig. 3h).42 During preparation, Pt is deposited as platinum oxide nanoparticles on the support (IrO2/RTO) followed by the reduction to its metallic counterpart.47 Therefore, the presence of Pt(II) and Pt(0) without any Pt(IV) confirms the effectiveness of the reduction procedure used in this study. The comparison of the binding energies of Pt(0) 4f7/2 and Pt(0) 4f5/2 for Pt–IrO2/RTO and Pt/C36 shows no shift which is likely due to the absence of strong metal support interactions (SMSI).36 The Ir 4f XPS spectrum in Pt–IrO2/RTO shows similar peaks to IrO2/RTO with a minimal peak binding energy positive shift (0.01 eV for Ir(IV) 4f7/2, 0.03 eV for Ir(V) 4f7/2, 0.03 eV for Ir(IV) 4f5/2 and 0.01 eV for Ir(V) 4f5/2) and similar peak area ratio (Ir(IV) 4f7/2/Ir(V) 4f7/2 = 1.9–2.1 and Ir(IV) 4f7/2/Ir(V) 4f7/2 = 2.61–2.65) (Fig. 3i). No additional peaks corresponding to other oxidation states of Ir are observed. The similar peak area ratio, absence of additional peaks and minimal binding energy shift confirm the stability of IrO2 under the reduction environment of Pt-deposition. Similarly, no peak shift and no change in peak area ratio are observed for Ti 2p as well as Ru 3d peaks confirming the high stability of RTO as the catalyst support during the catalyst preparation (Fig. 3j and k).
Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) is also performed to understand the electronic configuration near the Fermi level of RTO, IrO2/RTO and Pt–IrO2/RTO (Fig. S2†). RTO shows a much lower work function (∼2.3 eV) as compared to RuO2 (∼5.8 eV)56 and TiO2 (∼4.13 eV)57 due to an upper shift of the d-center and electron enrichment with synergy between TiO2 and RuO2. A slight decrease in work function for IrO2/RTO (∼2.1 eV) is observed as compared to RTO. The lowering of work function can be explained by the increased d-electron availability of Ir which constitutes the Fermi level of IrO2.58 However, the work function for Pt–IrO2/RTO (∼2.6 eV) shows an increase as compared to IrO2/RTO (∼2.3 eV) in spite of the deposition of metallic Pt (confirmed from XPS). This increase in work function is attributed to the deposition of highly electronegative Pt(2.28) with the d9 configuration that can accept electrons. The result is similar to previously reported results where the incorporation of metals with high electronegativity yields an increase in work function as compared to incorporation of less electronegative metals.59 Pt deposited on IrO2/RTO shows a lower work function as compared to Pt-deposited on other oxide supports such as alumina,60 which is attributed to the shift of the d-center, electron enrichment from IrO2/RTO, and synergy between IrO2/RTO and Pt, making RTO a suitable support for Pt deposition.
Electrochemical characterization
CV has been performed on Pt/C and Pt–IrO2/RTO in N2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 to measure the ECSA (Fig. S3†). For both catalysts, peaks appear signifying hydrogen adsorption/desorption on Pt between 0 and 0.4 V vs. RHE followed by the formation of a double-layer at 0.4–0.6 V vs. RHE (Fig. S3†). At higher potentials, metal surface oxide formation and reduction occur at 0.6–0.9 V vs. RHE during forward and reverse scans, respectively.61 Hence, the hydrogen adsorption–desorption method is a suitable methodology for calculating the ECSA for Pt-based electrocatalysts.62 The ECSA of the Pt-based catalysts is determined using the following formula: ECSA (cm2 mg−1) = QHads/Q0,Hads(2)where QHads is the total charge transfer due to hydrogen adsorption and desorption determined from the CV and Q0,Hads is the amount of charge transferred with monolayer adsorption (210 μC cm−2).63 The ECSA of Pt–IrO2/RTO and Pt/C is determined as 14.8 m2 gPt−1 and 60.3 m2 gPt−1, respectively. The difference in ECSA between Pt/C and Pt–IrO2/RTO may be attributed to the size of Pt nanoparticles as shown by TEM (Pt@Pt–IrO2/RTO = ∼5 nm and Pt@Pt/C = 2.5 nm).42 In addition to that, a positive shift is observed for hydrogen desorption (reduction) peak potential and a negative shift for the hydrogen adsorption (oxidation) peak for Pt–IrO2/RTO as compared to Pt/C (Fig. S3†). The negative shift of the oxidation peak for Pt–IrO2/RTO as compared to Pt/C signifies facile hydrogen adsorption which facilitates the HOR (Fig. S3†). The above phenomenon is attributed to better charge transfer/synergy between Pt and IrO2/RTO. The Cdl values, a surrogate of ECSA for all the electrocatalysts, are also found to be in the following order: commercial IrO2 > Pt–IrO2/RTO > IrO2/RTO > RTO > commercial RuO2 (Fig. S4†). A small increase (1.07-times) in Cdl is observed for IrO2/RTO in comparison to RTO, confirming similar ECSA of the materials. Similarly, Pt–IrO2/RTO shows slightly higher Cdl (1.36-times) and ECSA as compared to IrO2/RTO (Fig. S4†).
To investigate the applicability of the synthesized catalysts in the FP-URFC, OER and HOR tests are performed with as-prepared RTO, IrO2/RTO and Pt–IrO2/RTO in a three-electrode RDE set-up (Fig. 4). The HOR activity is investigated through LSVs in 0.1 M HClO4 under continuous hydrogen purging and compared with that of the benchmark Pt/C electrocatalyst (Fig. 4a). Both Pt/C and Pt–IrO2/RTO show much higher HOR activity in comparison to the other electrocatalysts (RTO, IrO2, IrO2/RTO) in acidic medium confirming the higher activity of Pt towards the HOR irrespective of the support material (Fig. 4a). Assuming fast reaction kinetics, the Nernstian diffusion overpotential (ηdiffusion) is calculated for the HOR using the following equation:14 (3)where R = universal gas constant, T = absolute temperature, F = Faraday's constant, i = current density at a given potential and i∞ = diffusion limiting current density.

When ηdiffusion is plotted (dotted lines in Fig. 4a) against current density, the plot is indistinguishable from the iR corrected experimental data (Fig. 4a). As ηdiffusion is calculated based on infinitely fast reaction kinetics, it is not practical to calculate the kinetic parameters for the HOR on Pt-based catalysts in acidic media, which is also confirmed from previous literature.14 The kinetics of the HOR in the Tafel region is difficult to measure due to high exchange current density. The exchange current density can be measured in the “micropolarization region” where linear current–potential behavior is observed (eqn (4)).64 (4)where i0 is the exchange current density. A linear relationship between current density and potential (“micropolarization region”) is observed up to ηHOR = 20 mV, that gives the exchange current density (iHOR0) for Pt/C and Pt–IrO2/RTO as 2.00 ± 0.08 and 2.87 ± 0.07 mA cm−2, respectively. The Pt-specific exchange current density is found to be 0.17 ± 0.01 and 0.97 ± 0.02 mA cmPt−2 for Pt/C and Pt–IrO2/RTO, respectively. The high iHOR0 for both the catalysts confirms a highly facile HOR with fast kinetics for Pt-based electrocatalysts in acidic medium. The exchange current density calculated from the “micropolarization region” is in the same order as that of the diffusion limited current density (id = 3.16 mA cm−2).14,65 Hence Tafel kinetics can be applied in the mixed diffusion-kinetics region (0.02–0.05 V vs. RHE) upon delineating the kinetic current.14,64 The iHOR0 for Pt/C and Pt–IrO2/RTO from Tafel analysis is found to be 1.47 ± 0.06 and 2.53 ± 0.06 mA cm−2, respectively (Fig. S5†). The discrepancy between the iHOR0 determined from the Tafel plot and micropolarization region indicates which is attributed to the presence of diffusional overpotential in the Tafel region.64 The higher iHOR0 for Pt–IrO2/RTO as compared to Pt/C can be attributed to better charge transfer and synergy between the RTO support and Pt that has been reported previously.42 The Tafel analysis of mass-transfer corrected current shows a Tafel slope of ∼61 mV dec−1 (2.3RT/F) and ∼58 mV dec−1 (2.3RT/F) for both Pt/C and Pt–IrO2/RTO, respectively (Fig. S5†). The Tafel slope indicates that the HOR proceeds through a parallel Heyrovsky–Volmer and Tafel–Volmer mechanism.64 The deposition of IrO2 and RuO2 on TiO2 also facilitates higher surface hydrogen adsorption and more rapid dissociation leading to the enhancement of the HOR.66
LSVs have been recorded in 0.1 M HClO4 under oxygen bubbling67 by sweeping the potential anodically to examine the OER activity of all the electrocatalysts in acidic medium (Fig. 4b). The overpotential (η@10 mA cm−2) required to attain 10 mA cm−2 is used as a standard benchmarking condition to evaluate the OER catalyst performance.68,69 LSVs for all the electrocatalysts (IrO2, RuO2, RTO, IrO2/RTO and Pt–IrO2/RTO) show excellent OER activity that confirm the effectiveness of RuO2 and IrO2 towards OER activity (Fig. 4b). The trend of OER activity is as follows: Pt–IrO2/RTO > IrO2/RTO > RTO > IrO2 (Table 1). In fact, the kinetics of OER on IrO2/RTO and Pt–IrO2/RTO surfaces beyond 1.55 V vs. RHE are so high that inefficient O2 bubble (high production) removal from the electrode surface inhibits the reaction rate and a jagged LSV curve is observed (Fig. 4b). RuO2 and IrO2 show excellent OER activity due to the high surface water coverage and lower overpotential required to stabilize OER-intermediates (–OOH, –O and –OH).70 The mass-activity of Pt–IrO2/RTO is 6.6, 21.7, 4.9 and 1.5-fold higher at 1.55 V vs. RHE as compared to IrO2, RuO2, RTO, and IrO2/RTO, respectively. Coupled with its excellent HOR activity, this reinforces its effectiveness as a low noble-metal loaded electrocatalyst for FP-URFC applications. RuO2 shows a low onset potential and rapid increase in current density followed by a sharp increase in the Tafel slope at high overpotentials (>1.65 V vs. RHE) (Fig. 4c).18,71 The decrease in activity with the increase in potential is due to the formation and subsequent dissolution of RuO4 and RuO42−.22 Furthermore, the surface of RuO2 transforms from the OH/O-terminated mixed coverage to the complete O-terminated coverage leading to an increase in the Tafel slope at higher overpotentials.72 RTO shows lower η@10 mA cm−2 as compared to RuO2 due to facilitated surface water coverage and lowering of binding energy of the –OOH intermediate which constitutes the potential determining step (PDS).73 This occurs due to the stabilization of higher oxidation states of Ru (>4+) through the interaction between Ru and Ti atoms and lowering of work function which is confirmed from our XPS and UPS studies, respectively.22 Despite showing high activity at low overpotentials, RTO shows lower activity at higher overpotentials as compared to IrO2. The reduced activity can be attributed to the dissolution of surface RuO4 clusters and transformation of the OH/O-terminated surface to the O-terminated surface.72 Furthermore, the lattice-oxygen mediated OER mechanism sets in IrO2 at higher electrochemical potential contributing to additional OER activity.74 the higher OER activity of IrO2/RTO as compared to IrO2 and RTO can be attributed to the combined OER activity of IrO2 and RTO, excellent synergy and charge transfer, and low work function (as observed from UPS) between RTO and IrO2. This leads to the formation of an electrocatalyst which can act with equal efficacy in both low and high OER overpotential regimes, overcoming the deficiencies of individual RTO and IrO2 electrocatalysts. Unlike RuO2 and RTO, the Tafel slope does not decrease at high overpotentials for IrO2/RTO, which can be attributed to the (1) high stability of IrO2 and (2) onset of the lattice-oxygen mediated OER mechanism.74 The lowest η@10 mA cm−2 is observed for Pt–IrO2/RTO (Fig. 4b). This is attributed to the following reasons: (1) additional active sites (i.e. high ECSA) due to the deposition of Pt,13 (2) interaction between highly electronegative Pt and Ir or Ru making them more oxidatively positive, thereby increasing OER activity and (3) synergy similar to IrO2/RTO as previously described.

The observed Tafel slopes are: IrO2/RTO (51.6 mV dec−1) ≅ RTO (51.7 mV dec−1) ≅ Pt–IrO2/RTO (52.6 mV dec−1) < IrO2 (54 mV dec−1) < RuO2 (73 mV dec−1) (Fig. 4c and Table 1). All the catalysts show similar Tafel slopes alluding to similar mechanisms, with the exception of RuO2. The low Tafel slopes for synthesized RTO, IrO2/RTO and Pt–IrO2/RTO and high Tafel slopes for RuO2 are similar to the previously reported experimental and theoretical (synthesized: 30–60 mV dec−1 and commercial: 65 mV dec−1) studies.18,20,71 The OER mechanism on metal oxides (e.g. RuO2) involves multiple steps with the formation of several intermediates as suggested from previous DFT studies.21,72,75 Three types of oxygen atoms, namely (1) single co-ordinated terminally adsorbed oxygen atoms (Ot), (2) two co-ordinated surface oxygen atoms (Osurf) and (3) three co-ordinated bridge oxygen atoms (Obrid) in MO2 (M = Ru, Ir, Ti) are involved in the OER.75,76 At the beginning of the OER, the mixed OH/O phase is formed that ends up as Ot covered (2nd electron transfer). After that bonds are generated (3rd electron transfer) between H and OH of water with Obrid and Ot–M, respectively to form H–Obrid and HOOt–M like an Eley–Rideal-type mechanism (M–Ot + Obrid + H2O → HOOt–M + H–Obrid).72,76 Then the H atom is removed from HOOter–M to form OOt–M which is followed by O2 release (OER) (4th electron transfer) to create free active sites to continue the process.72,76 The Tafel slope values (51.6–54 mV dec−1) of the OER for our synthesized electrocatalysts confirm that 3rd electron transfer would be the PDS with the formation of the HOOt-intermediate having the highest activation barrier. The result indicates that the OER mechanism is controlled by M–Ot + H2O → M–OtOH + H+ + e− (3rd electron) for our synthesized electrocatalysts.
The exchange current density of the OER (iOER0) is another tool to determine the intrinsic activity of the electrocatalysts. Pt–IrO2/RTO shows the highest iOER0 with almost 8.4-fold and 1.7-fold higher values as compared to the benchmark IrO2 and RuO2 electrocatalysts, respectively (Table 1). The result confirms the good intrinsic OER activity of Pt–IrO2/RTO. From the above results, it can be concluded that Pt–IrO2/RTO is a good catalyst towards the OER and HOR and can be used in the FP-URFC in acidic medium.
The stability of Pt–IrO2/RTO has been studied using an RDE setup by holding the potential at 1.7 V vs. RHE for 2 h (Fig. 5a and b). The OER activities of the electrocatalysts are compared before and after the potentiostatic hold-test. The HOR activity is also measured before and after the OER hold-test for Pt–IrO2/RTO (Fig. 5b). Pt–IrO2/RTO shows a high stability under OER conditions (0.06 V loss, η@10 mA cm−2,2 h = 0.36 ± 0.01 V). The decrease in OER activity may be due to the formation of Pt-oxides and dissolution of Ir- and Ru-species from IrO2/RTO (Fig. 4a). The HOR activity of Pt–IrO2/RTO is marginally decreased after the OER hold-test (Fig. 4b). The HOR current density is reduced by 0.05 mA cm−2 (∼5% decrease) at a potential of 0.1 V vs. RHE. The iHOR0 of Pt–IrO2/RTO shows an almost similar value (∼2.82 ± 0.05 mA cm−2) after the OER-hold test. The decrease in the HOR activity is ascribed to the probable formation of the PtO2 surface layer under OER operating conditions (Fig. 5b). A loss of ∼7.2% of ECSA is observed upon the OER hold-test. The decrease in the ECSA for all the electrocatalysts confirms the dissolution/passivation of the active sites.

The OER and HOR activities of Pt–IrO2/RTO have also been tested before and after the HOR by holding the potential at 0.5 V vs. RHE for 2 h (Fig. 5c and d). The OER activity remains unchanged confirming the high stability of Pt–IrO2/RTO under HOR hold-test conditions, which is attributed to the fast interconversion of the surface layer and surface active species (Pt ⇌ PtO2 and Ir ⇌ IrO2) (Fig. 5c).13 The HOR activity of Pt–IrO2/RTO remains constant irrespective of overpotential even after the HOR hold-test confirming the very high stability of the catalyst under HOR conditions (Fig. 5d). The high HOR stability of Pt–IrO2/RTO again can be attributed to the presence of more “noble” and highly stable Pt and Ir.77,78 The iHOR0 of Pt–IrO2/RTO shows an almost similar value (∼2.86 ± 0.04 mA cm−2) after the HOR-hold test. Our results show that Pt–IrO2/RTO has high activity and stability towards the OER and HOR, underlining its effectiveness towards FP-URFC application.
After demonstrating the superior bifunctional HOR/OER activity and stability of Pt–IrO2/RTO catalysts viz-à-viz Pt/C, RuO2, IrO2/RTO and RTO in a three-electrode RDE setup, we have fabricated a FP-URFC MEA (5 cm2 active area) using Pt–IrO2/RTO as the anode electrocatalyst to demonstrate its applicability (Fig. 6). The performance of the MEA using Pt–IrO2/RTO (1.0 mg cm−2) as the anode and Pt/C (0.15 mgPt cm−2) as the cathode has been evaluated at 80 °C under both water electrolyzer (WE) and fuel cell (FC) modes (Fig. 6). Our FP-URFC produces a current density of 1050 ± 22 mA cm−2 with much lower anode Pt loading (0.05 mgPt cm−2) in comparison to 1600 mA cm−2 with Pt–Ir/TiC at 1.8 V (0.72 mg cm−2) in the WE-mode as reported in the literature (Table S2†).12 However, our catalyst performs better (mass-transfer controlled region: 1388 ± 27 mA cm−2 at 0.5 V and kinetic-controlled region: 20 ± 2 mA cm−2 at 0.9 V) in comparison to Pt–Ir/TiC (mass-transfer controlled region: 900 mA cm−2 at 0.5 V and kinetic-controlled region: 15 mA cm−2 at 0.9 V) in the FC-mode.12 The FP-URFC tested under the electrolyzer mode yields a mass-specific and (Ru + Ir)-specific activity of 1050 ± 22 A g−1 and 1944 ± 78 A g(Ru+Ir)−1, respectively at 1.8 V. The FP-URFC in the fuel cell mode exhibits a mass-specific and Pt-specific activity of 20 ± 2 A g−1 and 400 ± 15 A gPt−1 at 0.9 V, respectively. In the mass-transfer controlled region in the FC mode, the mass specific/Pt specific fuel cell activity is found to be 1388 A g−1/27760 A gPt−1 at 0.5 V. The RTE (see ESI†) is determined as 57.6% and 40.2% at 0.5 and 1 A cm−2, respectively which is better than that reported by Kus et al. (31.8% at 1 A cm−2) with lower PGM loading whereas Regmi et al. show a higher RTE (60% at 1 A cm−2) as compared to our result (Table S2†).7,12 The excellent performance of Pt–IrO2/RTO as the anode catalyst in the FP-URFC is due to high Pt dispersion with small particle size, high OER and HOR activity of IrO2 and Pt, respectively, high stability and moderate OER/HOR activity of the RTO catalyst support. Regmi et al. show a higher RTE (60% at 1 A cm−2) as compared to our result (40.2%, anode: 1.0 at% Pt for 1 mg cm−2 (at = atomic), cathode: 0.15 mg cmPt−2) which may be attributed to their higher Pt loadings on both sides (anode: 10 at% Pt for 1 mg cm−2, cathode: 0.3 mg cmPt−2).7 As the total anode catalyst loading is the same for both studies, we have calculated the Pt-specific activity under the FC mode for both studies based on the Pt atomic concentration. In spite of lower cathode catalyst loading (0.15 mg cmPt−2vs. 0.3 mg cmPt−2), the Pt-specific FC activity for our study is determined as 1388 ± 27 mA per cm2 per at%Pt (at 0.5 V) which is much higher than that (FC: 180 mA per cm2 per at%Pt) reported by Regmi et al. in the mass-transfer controlled region.7 Our study also shows higher Pt-specific (at%) activity (FC: 164 ± 7 mA per cm2 per at%Pt at 0.8 V) as compared to Regmi et al. (FC: 40 mA per cm2 per at%Pt at 0.8 V) at 0.8 V. We have not compared the Pt-specific (at%) activity at 0.9 V, since it is not mentioned (could not be extracted) by Regmi et al.7 As Pt is not an active OER electrocatalyst, the specific WE activity for our study is calculated based on Ir and Ru atomic concentration (total 19 at%) and compared with the literature. Regmi et al. showed an activity of ∼14 mA per cm2 per at%Ir under the WE mode which is also lower than that (∼22 ± 2 mA per cm2 per at%Ir+Ru at 1.5 V) reported by our study. However, after 5 consecutive URFC cycles (electrolyzer + fuel cell), the RTE is reduced from 57.6% to 25% at 0.5 A cm−2 (Fig. 6). Upon comparing the polarization curves of the 1st cycle and 5th cycle of the fuel cell, a major reduction in performance is observed in the ohmic region which includes electronic and ionic contribution. This indicates that a combination of membrane degradation79,80 and surface oxidation of the Ti gas-diffusion layer (GDL) leading to electrical contact issues is responsible for reduction in the performance. Therefore, our work achieves excellent initial FP-URFC performance with high RTE for low PGM loading both at the anode and cathode. However, our cycling stability at these low loadings needs to be improved.

The activity and the stability of the synthesized electrocatalyst can be further improved through better dispersion of small-sized Pt particles on the IrOx electrocatalyst through novel synthesis methods. The synergistic strong support–electrocatalyst interaction can further help in faceting of the electrocatalysts which can increase the stability of the electrocatalyst.35 Through the appropriate choice of supports, highly active facets of the electrocatalysts can also be exposed to increase the URFC performance.81 In addition to the choice of electrocatalysts, the fabrication method of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) also affects the performance of URFCs.82 The porosity, tortuosity and roughness of the electrode influence the catalyst utilization and mass transport behavior of URFCs.82 Optimization of these parameters through a novel fabrication method can be useful in achieving higher URFC performance.
Conclusion
Pt–IrO2/RTO is synthesized and evaluated as a bifunctional HOR/OER electrocatalyst for FP-URFC applications. Pt–IrO2/RTO is synthesized by depositing IrO2 on RTO followed by Pt deposition. RTO is composed of a mixed metal oxide structure of RuO2 and TiO2 as confirmed from XRD studies. Pt–IrO2/RTO shows higher OER activity in comparison to benchmark OER (commercial RuO2 and commercial IrO2) as well synthesized IrO2/RTO and RTO electrocatalysts. The increased OER activity can be ascribed to the higher ECSA and increased metal oxidation states of Ru and Ir atoms. In addition to this, Pt–IrO2/RTO has higher stability under OER operating conditions as confirmed from ICP-MS. Pt–IrO2/RTO retains its OER activity after a HOR hold-test. Pt–IrO2/RTO also exhibits higher HOR activity and stability than benchmark HOR (commercial Pt/C) electrocatalyst. The HOR activity of Pt–IrO2/RTO remains almost the same after both OER and HOR hold-tests. We have tested Pt–IrO2/RTO as an anodic HOR/OER electrocatalyst in a FP-URFC system under both electrolyzer and fuel cell modes with Pt/C as the cathode. The FP-URFC in a fuel cell mode exhibits a mass-specific and Pt-specific activity of 20 ± 2 A g−1 and 400 ± 15 A gPt−1 at 0.9 V, respectively. The FP-URFC in an electrolyzer mode exhibits a mass-specific and (Ru + Ir)-specific activity of 1050 ± 22 A g−1 and 1944 ± 78 A g(Ru+Ir)−1 at 1.8 V, respectively. The FP-URFC shows excellent performance with high RTE (40.2% at 1 A cm−2) using significantly lower PGM loading (loading = 1 mg cm−2; Pt = 1 at% and Ru + Ir = 19 at%) than previous studies, signifying the usefulness of Pt–IrO2/RTO as a HOR/OER bifunctional electrocatalyst for future energy and fuel production applications.
