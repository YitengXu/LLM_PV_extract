    , Accepted 27th May 2020First published on 28th May 2020AbstractIn comparison with symmetric small molecule acceptors (SMAs), their asymmetric counterparts have received much less attention. Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on asymmetric non-fullerene SMAs previously reported show relatively low power conversion efficiency (PCE < 15%) and lower short circuit current densities (Jsc < 20 mA cm−2), although they exhibit a larger dipole moment and stronger intermolecular interactions. Here we report a new asymmetric A–D1A′D2–A type SMA, namely Y22, containing an asymmetric hexacyclic fused donor–acceptor–donor (DA′D) type central framework and end-capped with two electron-deficient 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile moieties. Y22 shows good solubility and a broad near-infrared absorption. The effects of the asymmetric structure on the physicochemical and photovoltaic performance were systematically investigated. Y22-based OSCs were fabricated by using PM6, QX2 and J71 as polymer donors, all exhibiting high PCEs over 10%. Notably, the optimal PM6:Y22-based device shows a high PCE of 15.4% and a high Jsc of 24.37 mA cm−2, which is among the best values reported for asymmetric SMA based OSCs, attributed to the fine nanofiber morphology after thermal annealing and solvent addition. This work demonstrates that the asymmetric fused structure with an electron-deficient-core is a promising building block to build high performance SMAs towards efficient photovoltaic applications.
1 Introduction
With economic development, the energy crisis is becoming more and more serious.1 Solution-processable bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted considerable attention in recent years due to some of their features such as mechanical flexibility, low weight, tunable absorption and semitransparency.2–11 In the previous two decades before 2015, OSCs were usually fabricated using the blend of a conjugated polymer donor (D) and a fullerene derivative acceptor (A) as the active layer, with the maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 11% achieved by molecular design and device engineering.4,12–14 However, fullerene derivatives possess some limitations, such as low structural tunability, high cost and weak absorption in the visible to near-infrared region,6,7,15–18 which commonly leads to low short circuit current density (Jsc) and imposes some restrictions on further PCE improvements. In addition, photovoltaic devices based on fullerene derivatives show poor photostability in air.19 In order to address this dilemma, SMAs with optical complementarity, energetic compatibility and moderate crystallization have been developed rapidly in recent years.16,20–22 So far, most SMAs have mainly adopted acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) molecular skeletons, and PCEs of the SMA based devices quickly surpassed 12% in a very short period.1,21,23–26 For example, Zhan and co-workers developed a kind of fused ring SMAs, abbreviated as ITIC, using indacenodithiophene (IDT) or indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) as the multicyclic fused core.27–29 Meanwhile, asymmetric A–D–A type molecular systems have also been investigated with decent photovoltaic parameters.30 Sun and co-workers designed and synthesized a series of asymmetric non-fullerene fused-ring electron acceptors. Among them, TTPTTT-4F possessed a more rigid coplanar structure with more fused rings, which is beneficial to π-electron delocalization and a broad optical absorption range. Thus, the PBT1-C:TTPTTT-4F device showed a high PCE of 12.05%.31 Moreover, Yang and co-workers reported a series of asymmetric SMA materials, which show a good absorption range, large dipole moment,32 elevated LUMO energy level,33,34 simultaneously enhanced π–π stacking33 and higher electron mobility. One asymmetric ladder-type donor unit 4,4,9,9-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b]thiophene-alt-[5,6-d]thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDT6) was designed by incorporating one thiophene into indacenodithiophene (IDT) or removing one thiophene from indacenodithieno[3,2-b] thiophene (IDTT). The resulting asymmetric SMA showed moderate absorption, energy levels and large dipole moments that enhanced the intermolecular interaction and altered the molecular stacking pattern. So the IDT6CN-M based devices, one of the IDT6 derivatives with 2-(5/6-methyl-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (DCI-M) end groups, exhibited a high PCE of 11.20% and a high FF of up to 76.72%.35 In the past two years, our group has opened a new door to highly efficient SMAs, using the A–DA′D–A type molecular strategy.36 Among them, a new class of non-fullerene acceptors, named Y6,36 employs a ladder-type electron-deficient-core-based central fused ring (dithienothiophen[3.2-b]-pyrrolobenzothiadiazole) with a benzothiadiazole (BT) core to fine-tune its absorption and electron affinity. The PM6:Y6 based single-junction device afforded the highest PCE of 15.7% with a high Jsc of 25.3 mA cm−2. Our group also synthesized other highly efficient photovoltaic SMAs (Y1, Y2 and Y9) by using benzotriazole (BTA) as the electron-deficient core37,38 while asymmetric A–D1A′D2–A type based acceptors have received less attention. Here, we adopt a symmetry-breaking strategy to obtain new SMAs with an asymmetric fused central unit toward high-performance OSCs.
In this work, we first designed and synthesized a new asymmetric SMA Y22 with an asymmetric ladder-type fused central unit and 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (2FIC) as the end-group, which is beneficial for enhancing intermolecular charge transfer (ICT).39Y22 shows a strong and broad absorption from the visible to near infrared region and a narrow optical band gap (Eoptg = 1.36 eV). In order to obtain higher charge transport and Jsc, the morphology of the active layer was optimized through solvent addition of 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) and/or thermal annealing (TA) treatment.9,22 It is found that all Y22-based single junction OSCs blending with different medium band gap polymer donors (PM6, QX2 and J71) exhibit high PCEs over 10%. Particularly, the inverted device based on PM6:Y22 achieved the best PCE of 15.4% with a Voc of 0.85 V, a high Jsc of 24.37 mA cm−2 and an FF of 74%, after finely optimizing the dosage of CN and TA temperatures. To the best of our knowledge, a PCE of 15.4% and Jsc of 24.37 mA cm−2 are listed among the best values for the reported asymmetric SMA-based OSCs (Fig. 6).30 Our work uncovers the fact that designing an asymmetric central fused ring is an effective strategy to promote Jsc for high-performance OSCs.
2 Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis
In this work, three polymer donors (PM6, QX2 and J71) were selected to prepare OSC devices with Y22, and their chemical structures are shown in Fig. 1. And the general synthetic route of Y22 is shown in Scheme 1. Firstly, compound 4 was obtained by a one-pot-stille coupling reaction with compounds 2, 3 and 1 using Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 as a catalyst. Subsequently, compound 4 was converted to the asymmetrical intermediate compound 6 through Cadogan reductive cyclization, followed by N-alkylation. After compound 6 was activated by POCl3, compound 7 was obtained by the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction. Finally, a Knoevenagel condensation reaction between compound 7 and 2FIC afforded Y22 with 60% yield. All intermediates were characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy; the structure of Y22 was confirmed by 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy and HRMS (ESI). Y22 exhibits good solubility in common organic solvents such as 1,2-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), chlorobenzene (CB), chloroform (CF) tetrahydrofuran (THF), etc. The thermal stability of Y22 was measured through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) as shown in Fig. S1,† which indicates a thermal decomposition temperature (Td) of Y22 up to 316 °C with 5% weight loss.

2.2 Optical properties and electronic energy levels
The normalized ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of Y22 and PM6 are presented in Fig. 2a. Y22 exhibits a broad and strong absorption range from 600 nm to 900 nm in film and demonstrates complementary absorption with donor polymer PM6,40 thus favoring high Jsc. Furthermore, Y22 shows a large red-shift (87 nm) in the absorption peak from solution to film, which illustrates strong intermolecular π–π interactions in the solid state.41 The absorption edge of the Y22 film is located at 910 nm, corresponding to an optical band gap of 1.36 eV, according to the equation Eoptg = 1240/λonset. The detailed data are summarized in Table S7,† and the absorption spectra of other donors are illustrated in Fig. S2.†

Electronic energy levels of Y22 were measured by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry, as shown in Fig. S3.† The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of Y22 were evaluated to be −5.69 and −3.94 eV, respectively. Moreover, the LUMO and HOMO energy levels of Y22 were calculated by density functional theory (DFT) (B3LYP/6-31G (d, p)) as shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†); the calculated HOMO and LUMO levels are close to the experimental values, and the HOMO level is well distributed on the central fused ring, while the LUMO is distributed mainly on the terminal group. The corresponding optical and electronic energy level data of the above materials are summarized in Table S6.†
2.3 Photovoltaic properties
In general, a good SMA can be compatible with diverse polymer donors. Herein, we selected three different commercialized medium band gap polymers PM6, QX2 and J71,42–44 to further investigate the photovoltaic performance of Y22-based OSCs. Energy level diagrams of the acceptor Y22 and three different polymer donors are shown in Fig. 2b. To evaluate the photovoltaic properties of asymmetric Y22 as the electron acceptor in OSCs, we blended it with different polymer donors and fabricated BHJ OSCs with a conventional device structure of glass/ITO/(poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/(perylene diimide functionalized with amino N-oxide) (PDINO)/Al. The conventional PM6:Y22-based devices show a high PCE of 14.75% with a Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 22.57 mA cm−2 and an FF of 75.72% under optimal conditions. To further improve device performance, we fabricated inverted photovoltaic devices, with a configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/polymer donor:Y22/MoO3/Ag. The photovoltaic performance was well investigated by optimizing the donor/acceptor (D/A) weight ratio, annealing temperatures, solvent additives and different donors. The detailed device processing conditions can be found in Table S1–S5.† The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the Y22-based devices with different donors are shown in Fig. 2c, and the corresponding data of the optimized devices are listed in Table 1. The asymmetric PM6:Y22 based device under optimal conditions (0.3% CN and TA treatment at 100 °C for 5 min) shows an outstanding PCE of 15.4%, with a Voc of 0.85 V, a Jsc of 24.37 mA cm−2 and an FF of 74.12%. It is noted that the PCE and Jsc are among the highest values reported for asymmetric NFA based OSCs so far.30 Meanwhile, the optimized QX2-based and J71-based devices also exhibit impressive PCEs of 12.69% (Voc = 0.78 V, Jsc = 23.76 mA cm−2, and FF = 68.07%) and 10.89% (Voc = 0.81 V, Jsc = 21.70 mA cm−2, and FF = 62.27%), respectively. It is worth noting that relatively high values (over 21 mA cm−2) of Jsc of the three above-mentioned OSCs were obtained, comparing with those of the other reported asymmetric fullerene-free acceptors. Their current density versus voltage (J–V) curves of the optimized devices under illumination of AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 2b. The results demonstrate that Y22 is a universal and efficient asymmetric non-fullerene SMA for OSCs.

The corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the Y22 based OSCs are shown in Fig. 2d. The EQE spectra of these devices display broad photocurrent responses ranging from 300–900 nm. In particular, the three Y22-based devices have an average EQE value of 80% from 500 nm to 800 nm, with the peak EQE up to 88%, resulting in high Jsc. According to the results of the EQE curves, the integrated Jsc from the EQE spectra for the Y22-based devices are in good agreement with the Jsc obtained from the J–V curves (within 5% mismatch).
2.4 Hole mobility
Considering the outstanding photovoltaic performance of the PM6:Y22-based device with PCE over 15%, the PM6:Y22 system was chosen to further explore the charge transport properties, using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method46 and the results are shown in Table S7.† A structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag was used to fabricate the hole-only devices and the electron-only devices were fabricated with a structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/PDINO/Al. The dependence of the square root of current density (J1/2–V) on voltage is presented in Fig. 3a and b. The mobilities were obtained by fitting SCLC curves described by the following equation:47  where J is the current density, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the transport medium component, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, μ0 is the electron or hole mobility, V is the effective voltage, and L is the thickness of the active layer. The hole and electron mobilities of the PM6:Y22 as cast blend films are 6.58 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.77 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (with μe/μh of 0.72) while the hole and electron mobilities of the PM6:Y22 blend films under optimal conditions are 10.88 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 9.99 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (with μe/μh of 0.92). The higher and more balanced charge carrier mobility in the optimized blend films should mainly be attributed to enhanced molecular arrangement, which can well explain the slightly higher Jsc and FF for the optimized OSCs.

(c) Light intensity dependence of Jsc of the OSC devices. (d) Photocurrent versus effective voltage of the as-cast and optimized devices based on PM6:Y22 (1:1.2, w/w). 
Charge recombination plays a critical role in exciton dissociation and charge collection in the OSCs; thus, the relationship between light intensity (Plight) and Jsc was investigated, as shown in Fig. 3c. Generally speaking, Jsc and Plight complied with a power law, expressed as Jsc ∝ Plightα, where α is a power law component.48 Experimentally, the value of α is close to 1, suggesting that more free charges can be extracted and collected effectively in individual electrodes prior to recombination, and the bimolecular recombination is negligible for OSCs. As shown in Fig. 3c, the α values are 0.905 and 0.985 in the OSCs based on PM6:Y22 under as-cast and optimized conditions, respectively. The results suggest that bimolecular recombination was more suppressed in the optimized device compared to the as-cast device, thereby leading to higher Jsc and FF. In order to clarify charge generation, dissociation and collection, we measured the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) in the PM6:Y22-based devices, as shown in Fig. 3d. The value of Jph/Jsat (where Jsat stands for saturation photocurrent density, and Jph is saturated at Veff ≥ 2.0 V) is classified as charge collection probability (Pdiss). Under the short-circuit conditions, Pdiss for the post-treatment device is higher (98.2%) than for the as-cast one (95.2%), indicating that the optimized PM6:Y22-based devices have more efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection, resulting in higher Jsc.
2.5 Morphological characterization
To investigate the morphology of the blend films based on PM6:Y22, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were performed.49 As seen from the AFM height and phase images shown in Fig. 4a–d, the nanofiber network structures are observed in both the as-cast and optimized blend films, which is beneficial for enhancing charge transport. Moreover, the AFM height images of both blend films show relatively small root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness values, 1.42 and 1.10 nm for the optimized and as-cast blend films, respectively. As seen in the TEM images (in Fig. 4e and f), all the blend films show proper phase sizes, smooth and uniform surfaces and nanofiber network structures, leading to favorable phase separation for efficient charge dissociation and transport, which are beneficial for the improvement of Jsc and EQE (Fig. 2d).

The height and phase images (size 2 × 2 μm2): (a) height image of the PM6:Y22 as-cast blend film; (b) height image of the PM6:Y22 optimized blend film; (c) phase image of the PM6:Y22 as-cast blend film; (d) phase image of the PM6:Y22 optimized blend film; TEM image (2 × 2 μm2) of the PM6:Y22 blend film (e) TEM image of the PM6:Y22 as-cast blend film; (f) TEM image of the PM6:Y22 optimized blend film. 
In order to study the molecular stacking characteristics in the as cast and optimized blend films, we conducted grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements (Fig. 5). In the as cast and optimized blend films, both exhibit the preferential face-on orientation, which is beneficial to vertical charge transport. The optimal blend films exhibit a stronger (100) lamellar stacking peak at 0.29 Å−1 in the in-plane direction and a clear (010) π–π stacking peak at 1.75 Å−1 in the out-of-plane direction, indicating stronger intermolecular π–π stacking compared to those of the as cast blend films. To confirm the contribution of the donor and acceptor to the enhanced molecular stacking, the corresponding line-cut profiles of neat PM6 and Y22 films are also illustrated in Fig. S11.† As shown in Fig. S11,† the neat PM6 film shows a relatively weaker π–π stacking peak around 1.75 Å−1, while Y22 tends to present a stronger peak intensity here. It indicates that the enhanced molecular π–π stacking is mainly attributed to Y22. Along this line, the lamellar stacking peak at 0.29 Å−1 in the in-plane direction could be assigned to both PM6 and Y22. Consequently, asymmetric acceptors, with relatively higher crystallinity, could promote molecular π–π stacking, thus resulting in an improved photovoltaic performance.

The recent photovoltaic data of reported OSCs based on asymmetric SMAs (PCE > 10% and Jsc >10 mA cm−2) are summarized in Fig. 6 and Table S9.† As shown in Fig. 6, Y22 is one of the few asymmetric SMAs with high efficiency over 15% and Jsc over 24 mA cm−2.45 We attribute this success to proper building block choice which is helpful for modifying the ICT effect and enhanced π–π stacking. Such a strategy manifests the indispensability of asymmetric SMAs in OSCs, where new breakthroughs can be made in the near future.

3 Conclusions
In summary, a new SMA Y22 based on an asymmetric electron-deficient core was designed and synthesized, with 2FIC as the terminal group. PM6:Y22 blend shows broad absorption and good molecular stacking. The Y22 based device obtains over 15% PCE in the inverted device with a high Jsc of 24.37 mA cm−2; the PCE and Jsc are listed among the highest values in asymmetric SMA based OSCs. This work demonstrates that asymmetric structure SMAs with an electron deficient core have great potential for constructing highly efficient OSCs.
