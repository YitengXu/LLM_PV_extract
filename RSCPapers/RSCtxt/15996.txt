    , Accepted 9th December 2018First published on 10th December 2018AbstractThis work investigates the kinetics of CO2 electrolysis on Cu-SDC (samaria-doped ceria) composite electrodes supported on YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) electrolytes. The Cu-SDC electrode was achieved by impregnating Cu into porous SDC with a copper nitrate solution. The electrochemical characteristics including polarization curves and AC impedance spectra were measured at different temperatures and applied biases, and in different atmospheres. The exchange current densities and charge transfer coefficients at various temperatures were obtained by applying nonlinear curve-fitting analysis to the current–overpotential curves. The polarization resistance derived from the I–V curve is consistent with that from the impedance spectrum, which indicates good reliability for fitting the Butler–Volmer equation to the I–V curve. The activation energy of CO2 electrolysis derived from the Arrhenius behavior of exchange current density is not affected by the atmosphere; however, it is decreased with the increase of impregnated Cu. The determined rate-limiting step is related to oxygen vacancies that play a vital role in CO2 electrolysis.
1 Introduction
In recent years, there has been an increased focus on the development of energy carrier technology due to limited fossil fuel sources and the environmental impact of emission of CO2 and NOx. Many research efforts have been made to develop solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO.1,2 High temperature SOECs may provide efficient, cost effective and environment friendly production of CO to store energy from renewable energy sources such as wind-, solar- and hydro-power. High operating temperatures of 500–800 °C are beneficial for increasing the reaction rate, efficiency and catalytic activity. CO2 electrolysis to produce CO and O2 can reduce CO2 emissions by converting it into useful materials and thus eliminate greenhouse effects and enable efficient energy storage. The CO product from CO2 electrolysis could be used for synthetic fuel production by Fischer–Tropsch synthesis. The majority of recent work on CO2 electrolysis has focused on alternative ceramic electrodes. Tian and Zheng et al.1 have reported excellent electrolysis results using SOECs on La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Ni0.2O3−δ ceramic fuel electrodes and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte with gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC) interlayers. In Li's work,3 a current density of 1.24 A cm−2 has been achieved at 800 °C and 1.5 V applied voltage for CO2 electrolysis in a symmetrical cell with an infiltrated Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6 ceramic electrode.
Cermet materials such as Ni-YSZ and Ni-SDC (samaria-doped ceria) have been primarily considered as fuel electrode materials. Mahmood and Bano et al.4 performed current–voltage and AC impedance measurements on a Ni-YSZ supported cell with a bi-layered electrolyte and LSCF (lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite) oxygen electrode, and observed a very high electrolysis current density of about 2.2 A cm−2 and 1.9 A cm−2 in steam and CO2 electrolysis at 800 °C, respectively. Osada and Uchida et al.5,6 developed a Ni-dispersed SDC cathode for hydrogen production that comprised of a La(Sr)CoO3 anode with a SDC interlayer and YSZ electrolyte, achieving a high electrolysis current density of 1.9 A cm−2 at an IR-free cell voltage of 1.20 V and 900 °C under the atmosphere of H2–H2O. Ni-based cermets have excellent catalytic properties toward H2O reduction, but suffer from coke deposition in CO2–CO atmospheres.7 Cu is less likely to be reoxidized under higher oxygen pressures than Ni, does not catalyze coke formation at high CO concentrations, and shows good catalytic activity for CO2 reduction.8 Meanwhile, ceria-based materials have attracted much attention due to their considerable electronic–ionic mixed conductivity and electrocatalytic activity at high temperatures.9,10 In addition, these materials offer the advantage of an oxygen nonstoichiometry change within the framework of a fixed crystal structure along with exceptionally high rates of oxygen diffusivity. Thus, doped ceria is a potential electrode material for high temperature CO2 electrolysis.
While many efforts have been made to develop electrode materials and improve their catalytic activity, the reaction mechanism for CO2 electrolysis needs to be further addressed. Polarization and AC impedance tests are always used to perform electrochemical performance and mechanism analysis for the electrode reaction. Zhan and Zhao11 have conducted current–voltage and AC impedance tests to analyze the electrochemical performance, the gas transport in the porous Ni-YSZ electrode and the adsorption/desorption process over the nickel surface. Kim-Lohsoontorn and Bae12 measured polarization curves using linear sweep current techniques and EIS to evaluate the performance of various electrodes such as Ni-YSZ, Ni-GDC and Ni/Ru-GDC.
However, there are few reports on the application of the Butler–Volmer (B–V) equation for electrode performance characterization and kinetics analysis of SOECs. The charge transfer coefficient for the B–V equation is frequently regarded as a constant of 0.5.13 For a full electrode analysis in a cell, it is necessary to accurately determine both the exchange current density and the transfer coefficient for both the anode and cathode reactions.14
In this paper, kinetics is investigated for CO2 electrolysis with three electrode configurations using a YSZ electrolyte-supported symmetrical cell structure consisting of Cu-SDC composite electrodes, which have advantages in terms of coke resistance and catalytic activity. The electrochemical characteristics including polarization curves and AC impedance spectra were measured at different temperatures and applied voltages, and in different atmospheres to better understand detailed reaction mechanisms of CO2 electrolysis to provide improvements in materials selection.
2 Experimental
Sm0.2Ce0.8O2−δ (SDC) powder was synthesized via the glycine–nitrate combustion method using Ce(NH4)2(NO3)6 and Sm(NO3)3·6H2O as precursors. All these chemicals (analytical grade) are purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (China). An appropriate amount of glycine was added as the combustion reagent. A mixed nitrate solution of Sm3+ and Ce4+ in the designed ratio was blended with the glycine to form a precursor solution, which was heated under stirring on a hot plate, and finally burned into a pale-yellow powder. The fresh powder was calcined at 600 °C for 2 h to obtain a pure fluorite structure. Dense pellets (13 mm in diameter and 0.5 mm in thickness) of Zr0.92Y0.08O2−δ (YSZ, Tosoh, Japan) were used as the electrolyte substrate. The dense electrolyte pellets were fabricated by pressing the fine YSZ powder at 200 MPa and subsequently sintering at 1450 °C for 4 h.
The SDC slurry was prepared by mixing the SDC powder with ethylcellulose and terpineol, followed by manual grinding. The slurry was screen-printed on both surfaces of the YSZ electrolyte and calcined at 1000 °C for 1 h in air to form a porous SDC layer, about 20 μm in thickness. Cu was deposited onto the porous SDC through the solution infiltration process. A copper nitrate solution was prepared by dissolving Cu(NO3)2 (analytical grade, Sinopharm) in distilled water with a Cu2+ concentration of 0.3 M. The solution was added dropwise to porous SDC using a microsyringe, followed by drying at room temperature and firing at 700 °C in air for 1 h to form a Cu-SDC composite electrode on the electrolyte-supported cell. The impregnation treatment was repeated to increase the Cu loading until the weight of the impregnation matter was ∼0.6 wt% and ∼0.8 wt% of the printed SDC. The configuration of the symmetrical half cell with a reference electrode is presented in Fig. 1. The distance between the working electrode (WE) and reference electrode (RE) is 3.0 mm. During electrochemical testing, the WE, counter electrode (CE), and RE were in the same gaseous environment.
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of the electrolyte-supported symmetrical cell with a reference electrode (WE: Cu-SDC working electrode, CE: Cu-SDC counter electrode, RE: Ag reference electrode, YSZ: electrolyte). 
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in CO–CO2 (50:50) (in volume ratio, the same below) and CO–CO2 (67:33) mixtures with three-electrode configuration measurements using an electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER IM6e). The frequency range was 0.01–105 Hz with a signal amplitude of 10 mV. Measurements were conducted over a temperature range of 700–800 °C. The current–voltage characteristic curve was measured by a quasi-steady-state method with a scan rate of 0.5 mV s−1. ZView software was used to fit the impedance data and to obtain equivalent circuits. Distribution of relaxation time (DRT) analysis was conducted for the EIS experimental data by the “DRT tools” program developed by Wan and Saccoccio, et al.15 For the computation of DRT with the program, an inverse quadratic function was chosen for radial basis function discretization, the real part of the impedance spectroscopy data being chosen, the regularization parameter λ = 10−4 was selected for smoothness of DRT profile, all the inductive data being discarded, the first order derivative was used as the penalties for the regularized regression, and the coefficient to the full width at half maximum (FWHM) was set as 0.5 for shape control. Origin software (Version 9.0, OriginLab Corp.) was used to fit the current–overpotential (I–V) curve with the B–V equation.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Equivalent circuit model
In order to understand and compare various polarization losses and associated reaction kinetics for Cu-SDC composite electrodes, electrochemical impedances were measured using the three-electrode configuration at various overpotentials and in different CO–CO2 atmospheres at different temperatures. The typical EIS is shown in Fig. 2a, where the intercept of the impedance arc with the real axis in the high frequency regime represents the ohmic resistance (Rs), with contributions mainly from the thick YSZ electrolyte. the intercept of the impedance arc with the real axis at low frequency reflects the total resistance, and the difference between these two intercepts is the overall electrode polarization resistance (Rp).
 Fig. 2  (a) Fitting results of a typical measured impedance curve along with the simulated Nyquist plots of each single impedance element and (b) the corresponding DRT curve (Rs: ohmic resistance; R1: high-frequency arc resistance; CPE: constant phase element; R2: low-frequency arc resistance; C: capacitance). The continuous line in (a) presents the CNLS fits. 
The EIS data are analyzed by combining the DRT method with a Complex Nonlinear Least Squares (CNLS) approximation to find an adequate equivalent circuit model, which is able to describe the electrode's physical behavior. In the DRT spectra (Fig. 2b), two main peaks are observed: one peak (process P1) at high frequency with a summit frequency of ∼10 Hz and the other peak (process P2) at low frequency with a summit frequency of ∼0.4 Hz. It should be noted that the peak P0 can be negligible due to its contribution to the total polarization impedance being smaller than 4%. Based on the characteristic frequency gained from DRT calculations, an equivalent circuit is proposed to simulate the electrochemical processes. The high frequency response, which is described as a depressed semicircle, is described by the resistance and Constant Phase Element (R1-CPE). When the CPE is used for the lower frequency P2, the resulting phase angle equals 90° (the parameter P = 1 in ZView software), indicating a pure capacitance. Therefore, the lower frequency P2 can be described by the resistance and capacitance element (R2-C). The CNLS fitting results and the equivalent circuit model are also shown in Fig. 2a. It can be seen that the measured EIS agrees well with the simulated lines, indicating the reliability of the equivalent circuit.
3.2 Effect of bias on EIS

Fig. 3 shows the EIS and corresponding DRT curves measured in the CO–CO2 (50:50) atmosphere under various bias at 800 °C. It can be clearly seen that ohmic polarization essentially remains constant; however, the Rp increases monotonously as the applied overpotential is increased. Rp values are 2.89, 2.45, 2.07, 1.77, and 1.53 Ω cm2 at +70, +40, 0, −40, and −70 mV, respectively. The high frequency process P1 is weakly dependent on the applied overpotential; nevertheless, the lower frequency process P2 is strongly dependent. In addition, P2 is obviously larger than P1, dominating the overall polarization resistance. The low frequency arc in Fig. 3a becomes smaller with increasing negative bias, indicating faster cathode kinetics at lower potentials (larger absolute value), which is also supported by DRT calculations in Fig. 3b. Yue and Irvine16 have also reported a similar impedance behavior for CO2 electrolysis in CO–CO2 systems on the La0.8Sr0.2Cr0.5Mn0.5O3−δ-GDC electrode. In the present study, the low frequency arc becomes smaller with increasing negative bias and becomes larger with increasing positive bias. This indicates that both the applied electric field direction and electric-field strength have an apparent effect on electrochemical kinetics. Under negative bias, electrons are delivered to the working electrode, reducing Ce4+ to Ce3+ to form additional oxygen vacancies, thus improving Cu-SDC activity for reducing CO2, similar to that under gas-phase induced reduction.17 This suggests that process P2 is related to oxygen vacancy formation.

3.3 Effect of temperature on EIS

Fig. 4 shows the EIS and DRT at temperature in the range of 700–800 °C. At every tested temperature, the low frequency response dominates Rp. The DRT peaks in Fig. 4b shift to higher frequency with the increasing temperature. Both peaks are strongly temperature dependent. The resistance derived from CNLS fitting the EIS with the equivalent circuit for each process, Rp and ohmic resistance are presented in Table 1. As the temperature is increased from 700 °C to 800 °C, all the resistances decrease significantly including the high-frequency resistance (R1), the low-frequency resistance (R2), Rs and Rp. To further analyze the resistance–temperature relationship, the traditional Arrhenius equation is adopted. σT = Aexp(−Ea/RT)(1)

where σ, T, A, R and Ea are the electrical conductivity which is related to the area specific resistance such as σ1 = 1/R1, the temperature, the pre-exponential factor, the gas constant (8.314 J mol−1 K−1) and the activation energy, respectively. Fig. 5 shows the results of ln(σT) as a function of 1000/T in the two CO–CO2 gas mixtures. The ln(σT) ∼ 1000/T for Rs shows a good linear relationship with an activation energy of 0.97 eV in CO–CO2 (50:50) and 0.96 eV in CO–CO2 (67:33). The results tested under two different atmospheric conditions show good agreement and the activation energy is well consistent with that for oxide ion conduction in the YSZ electrolyte. The ln(σT) ∼ 1000/T for high frequency response R1 also shows good linearity with an activation energy of 1.44 eV. However, there exists a slight non-linear Arrhenius behavior for the low frequency polarization process (R2), and a change in the slope is noted around 1020 K. A small and gradual increase in the slope is observed as the temperature decreases from 800 to 700 °C. The activation energies indicate good agreement with each other in CO–CO2 (50:50) and CO–CO2 (67:33) atmospheres, as shown in Fig. 5a and b. In order to interpret the non-linear Arrhenius behavior, the data for process P2 are fitted with two straight lines, one in the low temperature range and the other in the high temperature range, respectively. The activation energies in CO–CO2 (50:50) are 1.47 eV and 1.68 eV at the high and low temperature, and those in CO–CO2 (67:33) are 1.47 eV and 1.64 eV, respectively. Thus, the activation energy for P2 is almost not affected by the atmosphere. Such a non-linear Arrhenius behavior has also been reported for some ceramic materials including monocrystalline18,19 and polycrystalline.20–22 The behavior can be interpreted by the theory of oxygen ion conduction described by Kilner et al.23,24 According to the theory, the activation energy is the sum of the mobility enthalpy and association enthalpy. Since the mobility enthalpy is considered to be independent of the dopant, the variation of the activation energy with temperature can be ascribed to the association enthalpy of defect pairs.25 In the present work, the change of activation energy with temperature is possibly caused by defect association at the Cu-SDC interface. High temperature dissociates the defect pairs, , and thus lowers the activation energy for the CO2 reduction reaction occurring at gas–Cu-SDC three-phase boundaries (TPBs).

3.4 Effect of the atmosphere on EIS
The EIS in CO–CO2 (50:50) and CO–CO2 (67:33) at 800 °C are compared in Fig. 6a. The high frequency process remains largely unchanged in the CO–CO2 atmosphere, whereas the low frequency process is highly atmosphere dependent. As the CO content increases, the low frequency arc is decreased significantly. This is consistent with the corresponding DRT spectra shown in Fig. 6b. A similar phenomenon for the low frequency arc resistance has been reported26 for a GDC electrode in reducing CO–CO2 atmospheres. The resistance decrease at a high CO concentration can be interpreted by increasing the oxygen vacancy concentration associated with decreasing oxygen partial pressure, due to the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ in reducing atmospheres.27

3.5 Reaction process analysis using EIS
The overall electrochemical reaction on the cathode could be formulated as28 (2)where e′ represents free electrons from the current collector,  and  denote oxygen ions and doubly positive charged oxygen vacancies in the SDC lattice, respectively. So, the electrode reaction takes place at the Cu-SDC-gas TPBs. According to the reaction kinetics, the reaction rate of CO2 electrolysis increases with the increase in the concentration of free oxygen vacancies at the active sites and CO2 partial pressure. However, a high CO2 content means high oxygen partial pressure in the CO–CO2 atmosphere and thus would decrease the oxygen vacancy concentration as a result of the change in the cerium oxidation state from Ce3+ to Ce4+.29,30 This is supported by the observation that a lower CO2 partial pressure or/and an applied negative bias both of which formed more oxygen vacancies which caused impedance features of the low frequency polarization process P2 to shrink. Thus, the reaction rate is determined by the oxygen vacancy concentration at TPB rather than the CO2 content. Based on the dependence of each process on the temperature, applied bias and atmosphere (Table 2), it can be deduced that the high frequency process P1 is related to a fast step, and the low frequency process P2 is related to a step critically related to the oxygen vacancy concentration at the Cu-SDC interfaces, i.e. TPBs.

3.6 Current–voltage characteristics

Fig. 7 shows the I–V characteristics (ohm-free) of the Cu-SDC electrode measured using the three-electrode configuration. As the temperature rises, the absolute value of the curve slope increases significantly, indicating an increase in electrode activity. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the CO2 electrolysis, the experimentally measured I–V curve is fitted using the B–V equation. The purpose of curve fitting is to obtain the exchange current density and charge transfer coefficient and further to determine the polarization resistance, the activation energy and the rate-limiting step of CO2 electrolysis.
 Fig. 7  
I–V characteristics (ohm-free) of the Cu-SDC electrode at different temperatures in the CO–CO2 (50:50) atmosphere. 
In order to accurately apply the B–V equation, the applicable conditions need to be met. Considering all the overpotential effects, the external voltage (V) can be expressed as31,32 V = E − Vact − Vconc − Vomhic(3)where E, Vact, Vconc, and Vomhic are the equilibrium voltage, activation overpotential, concentration overpotential and ohmic overpotential, respectively. In this case, E is zero due to the fact that all three electrodes are in the same atmosphere, and Vomhic is also zero due to ohmic compensation during measurement. Assuming that there are no diffusion limits for reactants and products at sufficiently small overpotentials, the B–V equation can provide a relationship between the current density and the applied overpotential.
The B–V equation for CO2 electrolysis is shown as (4)where α is the charge transfer coefficient (0 < α < 2), j0 the exchange current density, j the net current density, η the overpotential and F the Faraday constant (96485 A s mol−1). The derivation process is given in ESI† for the application of B–V equation to CO2 electrolysis.
Based on a previous study,33 the elementary reaction steps are proposed for CO2 electrolysis on the Cu-SDC electrode (Table 3). When the charge transfer coefficient is less than one (0 < α < 1), the elementary step (2) is rate-limiting; When 1 < α < 2, step (3) limits the electrolysis (see the ESI†). Therefore, the value of the charge transfer coefficient derived from experimental data can be used to determine the rate-limiting step.

To avoid cumulative polarization effects, the appropriate range of voltage is applied for the quasi-steady-state current–voltage measurements. The I–V curves obtained from repeated measurements overlapped well. Typical quasi-steady-state I–V characteristics are shown in Fig. 8 (black line). It must be pointed out that the current density of the forward reaction, CO2 electrolysis, is positive. The I–V curve shows the asymmetric behavior for CO2 electrolysis and CO oxidation. The activity of the Cu-SDC electrode for CO2 electrolysis is significantly higher than that for CO oxidation. In addition, from the mathematical analysis of the B–V equation, it can be seen that only when the charge transfer coefficients of the forward reaction and the reverse reaction are equal, the B–V curve is symmetric about the coordinate origin. The coefficient is determined by the nature of the chemical reaction. The coefficient for the forward reaction (CO2 electrolysis) on the Cu-SDC electrode is more than 1 (see below), being larger than that for the reverse reaction (CO oxidation).
 Fig. 8  Typical I–V characteristics (ohm-free) of a Cu-SDC electrode of a symmetrical cell at 760 °C in the CO–CO2 (50:50) atmosphere. 
The parameters including the exchange current density and charge transfer coefficient are estimated through a numerical optimization. For this purpose, a nonlinear curve-fitting optimization based on the method of least-squares is applied to the measured I–V curves. The simulated curve in Fig. 8 (red line) is obtained from the B–V equation with the parameters derived from fitting the B–V eqn (4) to the experimental I–V data at the range of −50–+50 mV. The fitting results (simulated curve) match well with the experimental data in the voltage range from −60 mV to +60 mV. However, when the absolute overpotential is higher than 60 mV, the experimental data significantly deviate from the simulated curve. As mentioned above, the overall overpotential consists of activation, concentration and ohmic overpotential. In this case, ohmic overpotential has been compensated during measurement and the gas transportation is fast enough since the current density is pretty low. Therefore, the significant gap between fitting results and experimental data possibly comes from the limited accessible oxygen vacancies to TPB, i.e. concentration polarization for the oxygen vacancies at the Cu-SDC interface. Actually, no wider voltage range for good matching between the I–V data and the simulated curve is observed during the experiment at different CO/CO2 ratios. It can be deduced that the gap between the I–V data and the simulated curve results from the limited population of active oxygen vacancies at the interface.
The exchange current density and the charge transfer coefficient at different temperatures are obtained by fitting the I–V curve with the B–V equation. The corresponding activation impedance Ract is then calculated using the following linear current–potential equation:34 (5)where  is the total number of electrons transferred in the overall reaction ( in this case). Since the ohmic resistance is compensated and the concentration polarization at low voltage is neglected, the activation impedance Ract is equal to the overall polarization impedance. Comparison between the polarization resistance from the I–V curve, Rp(I–V), and that from the EIS, Rp(EIS), is shown in Table 4, which indicates good consistency. There is only a slight difference between Rp(EIS) and Rp(I–V), that mainly comes from the low-field approximation on the derivation of eqn (5) always causing the calculated value to be slightly less than the true value.35 The results suggests that fitting the B–V equation to the I–V curve for the kinetic parameters has good reliability.

3.7 Activation energy from exchange current density

Fig. 9 shows the Arrhenius plots for exchange current density. The activation energies for sample 1 are, respectively, 1.57 eV and 1.57 eV in CO–CO2(50:50) and CO–CO2(67:33) while it is 1.42 eV for sample 2 in CO–CO2(50:50). The results suggest that the activation energy is not affected by the atmosphere; however, it is reduced by increased the loading amount of impregnated Cu, which often results in increased TPB. This relationship indicates that the active site of the three-phase line determines the reaction rate at a specified temperature and reactant concentration, consistent with previous literature reports.33 The activation energy is affected by interface characteristics; a high Cu loading produces more Cu–CeOx interfaces and thus lower activation energy. There is charge transfer from the metal to the oxide towards the formation of reduced Ce3+ species on the ceria–Cu interface.36,37 Studies by Jesús Graciani et al.38 suggested that the ceria–Cu interface facilitates the adsorption and activation of CO2. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that the formation of highly active oxygen vacancies at the Cu/CeOx interface due to the increased Ce3+ leads to a decrease in the activation energy. In addition, the activation energy in different atmospheres obtained from the exchange current density determined by fitting with the B–V equation is in good agreement with each other, further indicating that the fitting method to derive the exchange current density is reliable.
 Fig. 9  Arrhenius plots of exchange current density for Cu-SDC electrodes infiltrated with various amounts of Cu (sample 1: ∼0.6 wt% Cu; sample 2: ∼0.8 wt% Cu). 
The activation energy determined from EIS for the Cu-SDC electrode infiltrated with ∼0.6 wt% Cu is 1.53 eV and 1.52 eV in CO–CO2(67:33) and (50:50), respectively (Fig. 5). There is about a 3% difference in the activation energy for the same specimen determined from the EIS and the exchange current density. This difference mainly comes from measurement methods and random errors. The exchange current density is obtained in the DC voltage conduction state. The EIS used for activation energy is obtained in the equilibrium state with a weak disturbance voltage.
3.8 Charge transfer coefficient
The transfer coefficient in the B–V equation reflects the extent to which the electrode overpotential affects the reaction. The larger the charge transfer coefficient, the higher the current density at the same applied voltage. Fig. 10 shows that the coefficient increases with elevated temperature. The coefficient for CO2 electrolysis on the Cu-SDC electrode is about 1.25 to 1.37 in the CO–CO2(50:50) atmosphere at 700–800 °C. In addition, the coefficient is affected by the atmosphere. It is higher at a lower CO/CO2 ratio. This indicates that the CO/CO2 ratio and/or temperature will affect not only the exchange current density but also the charge transfer coefficient. The coefficient for the forward reaction (CO2 electrolysis) increases when the temperature rises. Simultaneously, that of the reverse reaction (CO oxidation) decreases because it is constant, which is 2 in this case, for the sum of the charge transfer coefficients of the forward and reverse reactions. Notably, the value of the charge transfer coefficient (α > 1) indicates that elementary step (3) in Table 3 is the rate-limiting step for CO2 electrolysis. Since step (3) is the reaction with the oxygen vacancy at TPB, its rate increases with the increasing concentration of the vacancy. In addition, step (3) is the only primary process related to the oxygen vacancy. Therefore, it can be concluded that step (3) corresponds to the low-frequency process P2, which also dominates the electrolysis reaction and is related to the oxygen vacancy at the Cu-SDC interfaces.

4 Conclusions
The EIS of CO2 electrolysis was analysed to reveal the dependence of each process on temperature, bias and the atmosphere by combining the DRT method and an adequate equivalent circuit model. The results show that the high frequency process P1 is related to fast charge transfer, and the low frequency process P2 to oxygen vacancy formation at the Cu-SDC interfaces. In addition, P2 is the rate-limiting charge transfer process for CO2 electrolysis. The asymmetric character of the I–V curves indicates that the activity of the Cu-SDC electrode for CO2 electrolysis is significantly higher than that for CO oxidation. For the first time, the exchange current density and charge transfer coefficient are obtained by fitting the B–V equation to the current–voltage curve for CO2 electrolysis. The interfacial polarization resistance estimated from the I–V curve is consistent with that from EIS, which indicates good reliability of the results obtained by fitting the B–V equation to the I–V curve. The activation energy of Cu-SDC derived from the Arrhenius behavior between exchange current density and temperature is not affected by the atmosphere; however, it is reduced by an increased amount of impregnated Cu. Both the AC impedance investigation and current voltage analysis have shown that oxygen vacancies at interfaces play a vital role in the kinetics of CO2 electrolysis.
