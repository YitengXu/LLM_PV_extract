    , Accepted 8th January 2022First published on 4th February 2022AbstractSubstitution of the cation is a major focus to diminish the antisite defects and boost the photovoltaic properties of the Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 absorber. In the present study, a facile hydrothermal route was successfully implemented for the synthesis of Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 (x = 0.0 to 0.075 M) (CZITSSe) thin films for solar cells. The morphology of the CZITSSe was engineered from nanocubes to compact well grown nanoflowers like surface morphology. The improvement in the photocurrent (Jsc) from 3.09 to 4.26 mA cm−2 associated with the photovoltage (Voc) from 386 to 556 mV and accompanying improvement in the conversion efficiency (η %) from 1.96% to 4.82% were accomplished via Indium (In3+) ion incorporation. The composition CZITSSe (x = 0.075 M) showed exemplary photoelectrochemical behavior with a highest photoconversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.82%. Further, I–V performance of the deposited photocathode shows conversion efficiency of 2.01 to 5.12% as function of Indium ions incorporation. The improvement in PCE was mainly ascribed to improved crystal quality and suitable band gap energy. The EIS analysis demonstrates that the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the CZITSSe films was reduced with In3+ ion concentration. This work offers a one-step hydrothermal route that is a prominent way to develop an In3+ ion substituted Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 photoelectrode for competent solar energy harvesting.
1. Introduction
Progress and commercial synthesis of renewable power sources have received immense attention in current years by today's researchers owing to the restraint of non-renewable energy sources and consumption of fossil fuels. As sun is the limitless source of light energy, researchers have paid more attention to developing new and efficient photovoltaic devices.1–3 Nowadays, quaternary Cu2ZnSnS4 metal chalcogenide absorbers have attracted interest for the development and commercialization of solar cells.4,5 CZTS is a potential candidate in solar cells and alternate for the Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) absorber in PV materials owing to its cost-effectiveness, toxic free elements, and earth abundant elemental constituents.6,7 The highest photoconversion efficiency (η) of 12.6% was reported in favour of the hydrazine hydrate-based CZTSSe films.8,9 However, this record is so far below CIGS and CdTe counterparts, which have achieved 21.7% efficiency.10 Therefore, the CZTSSe photovoltaic materials need to be a notable improvement and optimization in the pathway of growth to refine its optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties by doping approach.11–13 The CZTSSe thin films are affected by some problems like the genesis of secondary phases during synthesis,14,15 unfavourable defect levels,16 and light harvesting ability.17 All these challenges are required to be addressed to accomplish the high conversion efficiency. One of the major parameters to improve the photovoltaic performance of CZTSSe films is to modify the band gap energy and desired morphology.18 The optimal band gap energy of the CZITSSe film reduces the rate of recombination and enhances the open circuit voltage (Voc) in PEC performance.19,20 Currently, researchers are focused on the band gap engineering absorber layer. This indicated that the band gap of the fabricated CZITSSe film was decreased by the doping of In3+ ion concentration.21 The band gap of the CZITSSe films was tuned to 1.5 to 1.0 eV by varying the S/(S + Se) ratios from earlier reports.22 However, the S/(S + Se) ratio in the CZTSSe film was restricted due to the highly volatile nature of the S and Se ion.23 In our previous report, we have varied the [S + Se] ratio with tunable band gap of 1.50 to 1.42 eV, and accomplished a conversion efficiency of 3.62%.24
Recently, Cu2ZnSn1−xGex(S,Se) alloy films were investigated to achieve better photovoltaic performance by grading the band gap energy.13 The band gap energy and morphology were tailored by exchanging Sn with Ge. In addition, alteration in the band gap energy was achieved by substation Zn by Fe ions in the Cu2ZnSn1−xFex(S,Se)4 lattice.25 As relays with reported Fe, the In3+ atoms are more appropriate for incorporating the CZTSSe lattice due to the Zn2+ and In3+ ions having an adjacent ionic radius (IR). The IR of Zn2+ is 0.74 Å, and that of In3+ is 0.80 Å. Due to this adjacent ionic radius, the Zn2+ atoms present in the CZTSSe films are exchanged with the In3+ atoms.26 In addition, with increasing concentration of In3+ ion in the CZTSSe film, the superior morphology was obtained. This uniform and densely packed nanoflower-like morphology is favourable for better light absorption.27 A variety of techniques were reported to synthesize Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 and Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 alloy films, such as sol–gel technique,28 dip coating,29 chemical vapour deposition,30 pulsed vapour deposition (PVD),31 spray pyrolysis,32 sputtering,33 and thermal evaporation,34 with different morphologies, such as nanosheets,35 nanoflakes,36 and nanospheres.37 However, compared to non-vacuum based techniques, the vacuum-based techniques required a large vacuum system, sophisticated instruments, and harsh chemical procedures. The solution-based hydrazine hydrate assisted chemical route shows better PEC performance. However, the toxic hydrazine solvent retards the large-scale construction of CZTSSe thin film solar cells (TFSC).38 Hydrothermal synthesis is an easy and cost-efficient way for the synthesis of different nanostructured powders. As per previous reports, some studies are offered on the synthesis of CZITSSe nanostructures in crystalline powder using key based hydrothermal synthesis and further deposition on conducting glass substrates via spray pyrolysis, pulsed vapour deposition, spin coating, doctors blade, and screen printing. To accomplish good quality and adherent CZITSSe films with uniform and desired morphology, we have directly implemented the modified one-pot hydrothermal route.
In the present investigation, the hydrothermal process was directly implemented to construct a Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 absorber on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate by means of the disodium salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (Na2–EDTA) as a complexing agent. This direct implementation of the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 film on FTO dominates the crystal development and improved morphology of the CZITSSe (x = 0.0, 0.025, 0.05, 0.075 M) thin films. The main aim is to synthesize the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 thin film at various In3+ ion concentrations by one-pot hydrothermal route, and alter the optical, structural, morphological and compositional properties. Furthermore, the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 photocathode at various In3+ ion concentrations was analysed for photovoltaic performance with a comprehensive supporting EIS study.
2 Experimental
2.1 Materials
All the chemicals were procured from Sigma Aldrich and used without further treatment. Copper acetate dihydrate (Cu(CH3COO)2·2H2O), zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O), indium sulphate anhydrous (In2(SO4)3), and tin chloride (SnCl2) were used as sources of Cu2+, Zn2+, In3+, and Sn2+. We utilized Na2–EDTA as a complexing agent for the Cu2+, Zn2+, In3+, and Sn2+ ions. The sodium selenosulphite (Na2SeSO3) and thiourea ((NH2)2–CS) were utilized as a source of selenium (Se2−) and sulfur (S2−) ions. Na2SeSO3 was synthesized by using the previously reported refluxing method.39 Ammonia liquor (NH3) was utilized to maintain the pH of the solution. The photovoltaic and electrochemical characterization of the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 films were performed in europium nitrate (Eu(NO3)3) as a redox electrolyte. Herein, the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 film was directly fabricated onto a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate. The FTO substrates were cleaned carefully in an ultrasonic bath with isopropyl alcohol (IPA), acetone, and lastly in de-ionized water (DDW).
2.2 Synthesis of the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 thin films
In the protocol, cations are firstly complexed with the stable complexing agent to maintain the sluggish release of metal ions in the reaction bath. The separate 6 mL (0.2 M) CuCl2, 4 mL (0.1 M) ZnCl2, (0.0 to 0.075 M) 4 mL In2(SO4)3 and 4 mL (0.1 M) SnCl2 with 0.2 M Na2–EDTA were taken in a 100 mL beaker. After this, the pH of the reaction bath was maintained at 8.2 by adding liquor Ammonia (NH3). Then, with constant stirring, 6 mL solution of thiourea and Na2SeSO3 were added. The homogenous solution was formed using magnetic stirring for 10 minutes. Lastly, the whole precursor solution was poured into a Teflon-lined autoclave (50 mL). Then, a precleaned FTO substrate was placed in the Teflon liner in such a manner that the FTO conducting side was facing towards the solution. The autoclave was put in the muffle furnace to bring out the hydrothermal process at an optimal 180 °C temperature and 3 h time. After completion, the autoclave was naturally cooled down at room temperature. Then, the deposited brownish-black colored Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 film was rinsed with sufficient DDW. Lastly, CZITSSe films were dried in the oven for a half-hour. To explore the influence of the In3+ ion concentration on Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 films, the molar ratio of (Zn/In) in the reaction bath was assorted as of 0.00 to 0.075 M, and the film samples were selected as I1, I2, I3 and I4.
2.3 Characterization of the CZITSSe photocathode
The thickness of the CZITSSe photocathode was analyzed with a surface profilometer (AMBIOS XP-1). Absorption and structural parameters of the CZITSSe photoelectrode were analyzed by means of (UV-Vis-1800, Wavelength Range: 350–800 nm) and X-ray diffractometer (Bruker Model: AXS-D8, 2θ ranges: 10° to 90°). The Raman shift was analysed with Renishaw's Model: In via 90V727, excitation wavelength – 532 nm. The morphology and compositional data of the films were captured using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) set with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) (JEOL-JSM 6360A). The analysis of the valence states of the constituted ions present in the CZITSSe films were performed with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific, Model: Multilab-2000). The particle size, crystallinity and lattice parameters of the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 films were executed by using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and selective area electron diffraction (SAED) data.
2.4 PEC and EIS analysis of the CZITSSe thin films
The photovoltaic properties of the CZITSSe photocathode were analyzed with liquid-junction photoelectrochemical solar cell performance with a two-electrode cell arrangement. The fabricated CZITSSe film acted as the photoelectrode, the graphite blade acted as a counter electrode, and the Eu(NO3)3 solution acted as a redox electrolyte. The 30 mW cm−2 tungsten lamp was utilized for illumination of the photocathode. The charge transfer resistance was captured from the EIS analysis of the CZITSSe films with the three-electrode arrangement. Here, the CZITSSe film was used as a photocathode, Pt wire as the reference electrode and Ag/AgCl acted as the counter electrode in the aqueous Eu(NO3)3 redox couple. All electrochemical measurements were carried out on an Autolab electrochemical workstation (NOVA, Model: PGSTAT 100 potentiostat). Photocurrent-voltage (I–V) curves were carried out with a Keithley 2440 Source meter under AM 1.5 G illumination with 100 mW cm−2 intensity from a Newport Oriel Solar Simulator.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Probable process mechanism and reaction pathway for the CZITSSe film
The crystal properties and surface morphology of the fabricated photocathode are strongly correlated with the growth and fabrication process of the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 films on the FTO substrate. In the hydrothermal route, metal-complex assisted synthesis is used to fabricate the In3+ ion-doped Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 films with various In3+ ion concentration. Na2–EDTA is an efficient organic chelating agent, which is helpful to form a strong Metal–EDTA complex bond.40,41 At first, the cations are strongly bound with Na2–EDTA to slow down the rate of dissociation at elevated temperature and pressure. We achieved uniform device quality of CZITSSe by varying the Zn/In molar ratio utilizing a complexing agent. In this way, the high temperature and pressure the hydrothermal process enhances the reaction rate, resultant precipitation occurs rather than the preferred film formation. This difficulty was addressed by taking a high concentration of Na2–EDTA with metal ions. At optimal reaction conditions, the metal–EDTA bond was dissociated gradually. The metal ions react with chalcogen ions in the reaction via Ostwald's ripening law, followed by ion-by-ion condensation to form the desired film. The configuration of the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 thin film occurs when the ionic products of the Cu+, Zn2+, In3+, Sn4+, S2− and Se2− ions exceeds to the solubility product of the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 material.42 The preparative parameters for the fabrication of CZITSSe are tabulated in Table S1 (ESI†).
To probe the optoelectronic and PEC properties of the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 thin films, the In3+ ion content was probed from 0.0 to 0.075 M. The In3+ ion doping was checked up to x = 0.075 M, which showed consistent and compact film formation. As the In3+ ion concentration in the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 composition increased further, it showed peeling and cracking of the films. Thus, we set the optimal concentration at x = 0.075 M. Fig. 1 shows the plausible growth mechanism behind the formation of the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 photoelectrode.

The reaction pathway for the deposition of the CZITSSe films are as shown below. At first, the formation of a metal ion-complex of Cu, Zn, Sn, as per the shown reactions in our previous report.24 The additional In3+ ion formed a complex with EDTA, as shown in reaction (1): (1)At optimal pressure and temperature, the metal–EDTA complex slowly dissociates from the release of metal ions in the reaction bath.24 The dissociation of the In3+ content takes place as shown in reaction (2): (2)

In the overall reaction, the fabrication of the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 film on FTO takes place through ion-by-ion condensation, as follows in reaction (9): (9)
3.2 Thickness measurement
The thickness of the fabricated Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 absorber with various In3+ ion concentration plays a fundamental role in the absorption of light radiation. The thickness obtained for sample I1 is 540, and it increases to 645 nm for the I4 sample. The thickness of the photocathode can be influenced by two independent characteristics, like the uniform crystal development and morphology of the fabricated CZITSSe film. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the correlation of the thickness and band gap energy of the CZITSSe absorber as a role of In3+ ion concentration. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows that the thickness of the deposited film increases with increment in In3+ ion. The cross-section SEM images of the deposited CZTSSe and In3+-doped CZITSSe (I1–I4) thin films are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). It is revealed that the observed thickness values are in good agreement with the deposited films. The increase in the film thickness primarily may be due to the strong ionic bonding of the In3+ ions towards (S + Se) ion.44 Besides, as the In3+ ion content exceeds 0.075 M in the CZITSSe film, the film strain increases and peels off of the films takes place. Terminal growths of the films are obtained at 0.075 M In3+ ions concentration.45
3.3 UV-Vis spectroscopy
To explore the influence of the In3+ ion on the light absorption properties of the CZITSSe films, optical absorption spectroscopy was done for Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 (x = 0.0 to 0.075 M) films. Fig. 2(a and b) depicts the UV-Vis spectroscopy for the CZITSSe films at various In3+ ion concentrations. From Fig. 2(a and b), it is noticed that most of the absorption is in the wavelength range of 650–750 nm. A slight shifting in the active absorption edge of I1 to I4 was noticed with increasing In3+ ion in the CZITSSe film. This shift is ascribed to the improved crystalline nature and surface area of the CZITSSe for absorption light.46 The band gap energy of the CZITSSe (I1 to I4 samples) was executed by analyzing the graph of (αhν)2 versus photon energy (hν), followed by extrapolating a straight line to the energy axis (Fig. 2(b)) with the help of eqn (10): αhν = A(hν–Eg)n(10)Where “n” is the type of the electronic transition, “α” is the absorption coefficient, “A” is the parameter that depends upon the possibility of transition, “Eg” is the band gap energy and “h” is the Planks constant.

The direct and allowed type of band transition were observed for all CZITSSe films. The experiential band gap for the Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 film (I1 sample) is 1.42 eV, and it was reduced to 1.34 eV for the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 thin film (I4 sample). The reduction in the band gap energy is assigned to the increment in the film thickness of the sample (I1 to I4), and the introduction of extra energy levels by the In3+ ion near the conduction band of the Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 film.47,48 The optical absorption parameters of deposited CZITSSe thin films are tabulated in Table 1. Overall, improvement in the crystal quality of the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 thin films decreases the band gap energy and increases the incident light assimilation in the solar cells.49

3.4 Structural analysis of the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 films
The crystal structure and its parameters of the In3+ doped Cu2Zn1−xSnx(S,Se)4 films were assessed by XRD analysis. Fig. 3 shows the XRD pattern of the CZITSSe films as a function of the In3+ ion. The significant peaks observed at 2θ 28.76, 47.30, 56.43, and 60.98° were indexed to the lattice planes of (112), (220), (312) and (224), respectively, which confirmed the development of the kesterite crystal arrangement. The relative “d” spacing values of the hkl planes of the deposited Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 films follow the standard data of JCPDS No. 26-0575, validating the development of the pure kesterite crystal. As seen from Fig. 3(b), the minor shift in the (112) plane to lower 2θ values confirms the introduction of the In3+ ion into the Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 crystal. It might be due to the bigger In3+ ions exchanged for the position of the smaller Zn2+ ions in the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 crystal lattice. As compared to the bare Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (sample I1), the intensity of the (112) plane was slightly improved, which confirmed that the crystallinity was enhanced in the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 film (sample I4) with an increment in the In3+ content.50 The crystallite size of the I1 to I4 films was evaluated by Scherrer's eqn (11): (11)
 Fig. 3  (a) X-Ray diffraction patterns and (b) relation of shift in 2θ and the crystallite size of the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 films. 
In which “D” is the crystallite size, “β” is the full width at half maxima (FWHM), “λ” is the X-ray radiation source (Cu Kα = 1.5406), and “θ” is Bragg's diffraction angle.
The crystallite size of the deposited Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 film lies within the range of 34 to 48 nm. An increase in the crystallite size is ascribed to the enhancement in the crystal quality. The superior crystallinity and lattice structure of the CZITSSe film reduce the electron–hole recombination rate in the PEC cell.42 The microstructural parameters, like dislocation density and microstrain, were evaluated and are summarized in Table 1. As seen from Table 1, the values of the dislocation density decrease, whereas the microstrains were increased with the incorporation of the In3+ ions. The microstrain of the CZITSSe thin films were increased with the formation of a more strained film with higher In3+ content. The lattice constants were assigned for the CZITSSe (tetragonal) of (a = b ≠ c), and values were obtained as a = b = 5.134 and c = 10.745. These were coordinated with the standard JCPDS file. The overall XRD pattern demonstrates reduced grain boundary resistance and lattice imperfections of the CZITSSe films upon an increment of the sIn3+ ion in the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 photoelectrode. The development of such CZITSSe photoelectrode reduced grain boundaries is highly useful for boosting the photoconversion efficiency.33
3.5 Raman spectroscopy
Structural evidence from the XRD data is inadequate to predict the pure phase formation, as secondary (Cu2S, SnS, ZnSe), ternary (Cu2SnS4) and quaternary (Cu2Sn(S,Se)3) phases arise in the same 2θ values. To verify the phase formation in the CZITSSe films, Raman spectroscopy was performed using an excitation wavelength of 532 nm.

Fig. 4 shows the Raman shift in the CZITSSe thin films at various In3+ ion content. The results of the CZITSSe films at various In3+ ion concentrations showed that the formation of the broad peak at 338 cm−1 was assigned to the CZTS-A1 mode, and it matched well with the reported data. The lack of contamination peaks of binary and ternary chalcogenides was noticed in the Raman data. Moreover, peaks that arise at 194 cm−1, 234 cm−1 and 265 cm−1 in the Raman spectrum correspond to the A1 mode of the CZITSSe phase. The results are well accordance with the reported data for the CZTSSe film. The peak intensity in the Raman spectra was improved with increasing In3+ ion content. It is ascribed to the expansion of the CZTSSe lattice after the Zn ions were substituted by the In3+ ions. No other impurity peaks related to SnS2 (315 cm−1), Cu2S (475 cm−1), ZnS (278 and 352 cm−1), and Cu3SnS4 (318 cm−1) and Cu2SnS3 (297 and 337 cm−1) were noticed in the Raman analysis of the CZTSSe films. Therefore, the formation of a pure phase Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 crystal structure is concluded.

3.6 Morphological analysis
The surface morphology of the CZITSSe thin films plays a key role in the absorption of light, as it reveals the surface area of the fabricated photoelectrode. To analyze the effect of the In3+ ion content on the surface morphology, FE-SEM was captured for the CZITSSe film. Fig. 5 shows the lower and higher magnification FE-SEM images of the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 (0.0 to 0.075 M) films. The lower and higher magnification FE-SEM of I1 is depicted in Fig. 5(a and b). The low-resolution FE-SEM images (Fig. 5a), reveal the nanocubes-like morphology over the substrate. These small nanocubes are aggregated to form a sphere-like surface morphology, as shown in Fig. 5(b). On increasing the In ion up to 0.025 M, the formation of nanosheets-like morphology is noticed over the substrate support, and these aggregated nanosheets are made up of small nanograins. The surface morphology is highly bifacial to absorb the illuminated light during photoelectrochemical reactions, which is evident in the low and high magnification FE-SEM images of I2 in Fig. 5(c and d).
 Fig. 5  FE-SEM images of the hydrothermally synthesized Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 (x = 0.0 to 0.075 M) films. 
In addition, as the In3+ ion increases further as x = 0.05 M in the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 film, the formation of a bunch of different sized nanosheets are noticed at lower magnification. The high magnification images of I3 show these nanosheets are made up of a distribution of irregular nanospheres (Fig. 5(e and f)). Furthermore, as demonstrated in the FE-SEM images of I4 (x = 0.075 M), the addition of the In3+ content in the CZITSSe films (Fig. 5(g and h)) resulted in a compact and well-defined nanoflowers-type of morphology. The high magnification images show that these nanoflowers are made up of small nanograins. The FE-SEM images indicated that the nanoflower like surface structures of Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 films were formed with the increment in the In3+ ion content. The enhancement in the grain size of the films increases the surface area for incident photon absorption with minimum surface defects.51 Overall, the arrangement of the uniform and compactly packed nanoflowers provides a high surface area, which enhances the light absorption and interfacial reaction sites of the CZITSSe photocathode.52 The formation of a uniform surface and the nanoflower microstructures of the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 (x = 0.075 M) film improves the conversion efficiency.53
3.7 HR-TEM and SAED data of the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 film
To evaluate the microstructures and crystallinity of the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 films, HR-TEM and SAED measurements were performed. Fig. 6(a–d) manifests the HR-TEM data of the I4 of the synthesized CZITSSe films. Fig. 6(a) shows the high formation of the nanoflower-like morphology, which is made up of small nanograins. On further magnification at 20 nm (Fig. 6(b)), a surface morphology with the arrangement of small nanopetals was noticed. The HR-TEM images confirmed the average particle size of 20–40 for the nanoflowers structures. Fig. 6(c) shows the calculated lattice fringes of the deposited CZITSSe film. The calculated lattice fringes value for the (112) plane is 3.423 Å. As compared to the standard 'd-spacing' value in the lattice fringes CZTSSe film (3.169 Å), the observed value (3.423 Å) for the CZITSSe film is quite high. It is obvious that the expansion of the lattice of the CZTSSe film occurs due to the Zn2+ ions being substituted by In3+ ions, which enlarge the unit cell.54 Furthermore, the SAED patterns of the deposited thin Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 film are depicted in Fig. 6(d). The SAED analysis demonstrates the evolution bright spot in the form of a ring pattern, which validates the polycrystalline nature of the CZITSSe films.55 Overall, the HR-TEM and SAED study confirmed the substitution of the Zn2+ ion in the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 film by the In3+ ion due to the larger ionic radius of In3+ ion (0.80 Å) compared to that of the Zn2+ ion (0.74 Å), and agreed well with the FE-SEM and XRD data.

3.8 Compositional analysis
The chemical composition of the In3+ ion doped Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 affects the output PEC performance as it reveals the stoichiometry of the fabricated CZITSSe photocathode. Thus, EDS analysis was carried out for CZITSSe thin films. Fig. 7 shows the EDS analysis of the CZITSSe thin film at various In3+ ion content, revealing peaks arising at 0.8, 0.9, 3.1, 3.5, 1.4 and 2.3 eV that validate the occurrence of the Cu, Zn, In, Sn, Se and S elements, respectively. In addition, it was noticed that all films show a Cu/(Zn + In)/Sn ratio of 1.8:1.2:1 in the CZITSSe thin films. As the In3+ ion content increases from 0.0 to 0.075 M, the atomic content of In3+ increases from 0.0% to 6.2% and the Zn2+ ion decreases from 14.4% to 10.1%. The experimental ratio of Cu/(Zn + In + Sn) for samples I1 to I4 was increased from 0.84 to 0.88 with the increment of the In3+ content. This concludes the development of the Cu-rich and Zn-poor film formation. The Cu-rich and Zn-poor composition generated favorable defect complexes, which produces shallow acceptor levels to decrease the Fermi energy levels and eventually increase the open circuit voltage (Voc).56 The EDS data were in good agreement with the reported data for the high conversion efficiency.57 The compositional parameters for the CZITSSe absorber are depicted in Table S2 (ESI†). Fig. 8 shows the XPS survey spectrum of the representative I4 sample of deposited Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 (x = 0.075 M) photoelectrode. The survey spectrum shows that the Cu, Zn, In, Sn, S and Se ions are in the deposited films. The survey spectrum also shows peaks of C and O, which are assigned as adventitious carbon and atmosphere absorption of oxygen.42 Survey spectra of the deposited CZITSSe are shown in Fig. 8(a). Fig. 8(b) represents the core levels spectra of Cu2p, in which the two peaks appearing at 951.28 and 931.34 eV are associated with the magnified core levels of Cu2p3/2 and Cu2p1/2, respectively. In addition, the splitting between these two peaks is 19.94 eV, which affirms the presence of the Cu+ ions.24Fig. 8(c) shows the magnified spectra of Zn2p. Two distinct peaks occur at 1045.12 and 1022 eV allotted to the Zn2p3/2 and Zn2p1/2 core levels. The difference between the two peaks is 23.12 eV, which shows the Zn2+ ion.58Fig. 8(d) depicts the magnified spectrum of In3d. The two peaks observed at 451.23 and 443.82 eV are correlated with In3d3/2 and In3d5/2 core levels. These two peaks split with 7.41 eV, which confirms the In3+ ion.59 The core level spectra of Sn3d are shown in Fig. 8(e). The doublet present at 494.97 and 486.49 eV is equivalent to the Sn3d3/2 and Sn3d5/2 core levels with the difference in splitting energy at 8.48 eV, which is consistent with Sn present in Sn4+. Moreover, no peak was observed around 485 eV, which depicts the absence of Sn2+ related to tin.60

Fig. 8(f) depicts the core level spectra of S2p. The two distinct peaks observed at 166.02 and 160.82 eV are correlated to S2p1/2 and S2p3/2, respectively. The splitting of these two peaks is 5.2 eV, which confirms S2− ions.61 The core level spectrum of Se3d is depicted in Fig. 8(g). The strong peak assigned at 54.1 eV corresponds to Se3d, which confirms the Se2− oxidation state.62 Overall, the core level spectrum for the composed elements of Cu, Zn, In, Sn, S and Se ions are in good agreement with their arrangement for the Cu+, Zn2+, In3+, Sn4+, S2− and Se2− valence states. The In3+ ion was doped successfully and occupied the site of the Zn2+ ion in the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 film.
3.9 Photovoltaic performance of the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 photocathode
The photovoltaic performance of the In3+ doped Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 photoelectrode was measured by a photoelectrochemical cell. The influence of the In3+ ion on the crystal structure, morphology and absorption affect the output photoconversion efficiency. The schematic of the CZITSSe photocathode working in the PEC solar cell is shown in Fig. 9.
 Fig. 9  Schematic electrode representation in the PEC cell. 
The two-electrode system is configured with the CZITSSe film used as the active photoelectrode, and graphite was used as the counter electrode. An aqueous solution of (0.3 M) Eu(NO3)3 was utilized as a redox electrolyte, and a 30 mW cm−2 W lamp was used as an incident light source. The electrode cell configuration of glass/FTO/CZITSSe∣(0.3 M Eu3+/Eu2+)aq.∣graphite was used to assess the PEC performance. As the photocathode was illuminated by light, the excitation of a hole to electron from the valence band to conduction band occurs. The superior crystallinity and surface morphology provide more surface area to absorb incident photons.
As CZITSSe films are a p-type semiconductor, e− acts as minority charge carriers and h+ are majority charge carriers. The evolution of the compact nanoflower morphology on the FTO substrate reduces the distance between the CZITSSe photocathode-electrolyte, so it is necessary to allocate to reduces the conversion of Eu3+ to Eu2+ by recombination with photogenerated holes.63 The J–V characteristics of the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 photocathode are shown in Fig. 10. The PEC property of the CZITSSe was analyzed under dark condition and with illumination (Intensity-30 mW cm−2). The electrode performance in the dark condition shows the diode like rectifier characteristics. Furthermore, in sample I4, the small dark current was observed. It might be due to the reactive surface of the CZITSSe electrode to the electrolyte. Further, J–V curve of sample I4 shows the diode-like characteristics.64 Conversely, under the light source, the J–V curves indicate photoactivity of the CZITSSe. Based on the J–V measurement, the fill factor of the PEC cell was estimated using eqn (12): (12)Where “Jmax” is the maximum current, “Voc” is the open circuit voltage, “Jsc” is the short circuit current, and “Vmax” is the maximum voltage. Fig. S3 (ESI†) depicts the correlation between Jsc assigned to Voc at various In3+ ion contents. The conversion efficiency of the CZITSSe photocathode was evaluated by using eqn (13), (13)in which “η” is the conversion efficiency and “Pin” corresponds to the light source used for the illumination of the CZITSSe photocathode. As seen from Fig. 10(a–d), the J–V measurement, the Voc values of the samples I1, I2, I3 and I4 were 386, 397, 479 and 556 mV, corresponding to the photocurrent generated at 3.09, 3.84, 4.13 and 4.26 mA cm−2, respectively. The values of the open Voc and Jsc were improved as the In3+ ion content in the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 (x = 0.0 to 0.075 M) increased. It might be due to the improved crystallinity and the nanoflower-like morphology. As compared with a nanocubic surface (Fig. 10a), a nanoflower surface (Fig. 10d) provides a larger surface area and more interfacial reactive sites, which improve the photon absorption and kinetics in the PEC process. The solar cell with the composition of CZITSSe nanoflowers (I4) possesses Jsc of 4.26 mA cm−2 and Voc of 556 mV, which exhibits the best efficiency of 4.82%.

From the J–V analysis, the shunt resistance (Rsh) and series resistance (Rs) produced in the CZITSSe-electrolyte interface were analyzed by taking the inverse slope of the J–V curves. The magnitudes of the Rs and Rsh values of samples I1 to I4 are tabulated in Table 2. From Table 2, the Rs and Rsh values of the circuit were observed to decrease with an increase in the In3+ ion content in the CZITSSe photocathode. The Rs and Rsh of the circuit largely influenced the photovoltaic performance.

At lower Rs, the formation of Jsc in the PEC cell is superior. The inferior Rsh furnishes the higher Voc.65 The ideality factors of the CZITSSe (0.0–0.075 M) photocathode were estimated from the J–V curves, and are estimated by plotting ln Jscversus Voc with eqn (14), I = IoeqV/ndkT(14)
Where “V” is the forward bias voltage, “nd” is the ideality factor, “k” is the Boltzmann constant, “q” is the electric charge, “I0” is the reverse saturation current and “T” is the absolute temperature. In a semiconductor diode, the “nd” lies between 1 to 2, which is dominant upon recombination current and diffusion current in PEC cell.66 The deposited I1, I2, I3, and I4 show ideality factors of 1.6, 1.4, 1.5 and 1.3, respectively. The photovoltaic cell parameters of the CZITSSe photocathode are tabulated in Table 2.
The enhancement in the conversion efficiency was observed with increasing In3+ ion in Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 (x = 0.0 to 0.075 M absorber). The boost in the PEC performance was observed for the Cu2Zn0.025In0.075Sn(S,Se)4 composition. It is ascribed to the increment in the Jsc and Voc of the I4. The improvement in the crystallinity, superior nanoflower microstructures and increment in grain size reduces the grain boundary resistance and produces a better electron transfer pathway at the CZITSSe-electrolyte interface.67 The I4 shows the best photoconversion efficiency compared to I1 to I3. It might be due to the origin of the compact CZITSSe nanoflowers, which minimizes the surface traps. Furthermore, Jsc and Voc manifest the lower values of the Rs and Rsh produced at the CZITSSe-electrolyte interface.

3.9.1 
            I–V measurement of the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 photocathode. 
The I–V characteristics performance of the deposited bare and In3+doped CZTSSe thin films were analyzed on solar simulator. Fig. 11 shows the current density–voltage (I–V) curves of the I1 to I4 samples with different In3+ ion concentration, i.e., (x = 0.0 to 0.075 M) (CZITSSe) thin films. The former technique has the advantage of being able to determine performance parameters, such as short-circuit current (Isc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and series resistance, with high accuracy. The I–V measurement was greatly influenced by the Zn/In composition in the Cu2Zn1xInxSn(S,Se)4 thin films. As seen from Fig. 11 (I1–I4), the I–V measurement, Voc of the samples I1, I2, I3 and I4 were 389, 419, 481 and 525 mV, which is equivalent to the short circuit current (Isc) generated 3.13, 3.94, 4.20 and 5.20 mA cm−2, respectively. The values of the open Voc and Isc improved as the In3+ ion was increased in Cu2Zn1xInxSn(S,Se)4 (x = 0.0 to 0.075 M). This could be attributed to the increased surface area due to the nanoflower-like morphology, which improves the photon absorption and kinetics in the PEC process with minimum grain boundary resistance. The solar cell composed of CZITSSe nanoflowers (I4) has an Isc of 5.20 mA cm−2 and a Voc of 525 mV, resulting in the highest efficiency of 5.12%. Table 3 lists the I–V measurement parameters of the CZITSSe photocathode. In this report, the highest photoconversion efficiency (η = 5.12) was obtained for Cu2Zn1xInxSn(S,Se)4 photocathode on the solar simulator.

3.10 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy

3.10.1 Nyquist plot of the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 photoelectrode. 
The influence of the In3+ content on the charge transfer characteristics of the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 thin films was assessed using EIS measurement. In EIS, the CZITSSe films acted as the photocathode, Pt wire was utilized as the reference, Ag/AgCl was the counter electrode (CE), and (0.3 M) Eu(NO3)3 was the redox electrolyte.68,69Fig. 12 shows the EIS analysis of the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 (x = 0.0 to 0.075 M) photocathode. In a typical Nyquist plot from the EIS measurement, the semicircle manifests the high-frequency corresponding to the double layer capacitance (Cdl). The core frequency area is equivalent to the charge transfer resistance (Rct), whereas the lower frequency region shows the Warburg resistance (Zw). EIS data corresponding to Rs, Rct, Cdl and Zw of the fabricated CZITSSe photocathode were obtained by the Randles circuit. The EIS parameters of the fabricated Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 films at various In3+ ions are tabulated in Table 4. Fig. 12(a–d) shows that the semicircle region decreases continuously. Fig. 12(d) indicates the smaller semicircle region in the Nyquist plot, depicting the generation of the lower Rct at the CZITSSe-electrolyte interface.59 The CZITSSe films reveal reduced Rct with the increment in the In3+ ion. It is attributed to the formation of dense and compactly grown nanoflowers. The smaller semicircle observed at Cu2Zn0.025In0.075Sn(S,Se)4 confirms the formation of lower Rct (35.1 Ω cm−2). The gradual decrease in the charge transfer resistance of samples I1 to I4 (4.97 kΩ–35.1 Ω) is assigned to the improved film compactness and uniformity, along with the structural morphology from the nanocubes to nanoflowers.70–72 At the onset potentials, the impedance spectra of I1 and I2 show large charge transfer resistance. This might be due to the lower surface compactness due to the nanocubic morphology. In addition, the increase of the electrode resistance values with of I1 and I2 is due to the increase of the hydrophobic behavior of the surface, which reduces the contact between the electrode and electrolyte. Meanwhile, I3 and I4 show inductive resistance at high frequency, a very small capacitive loop at middle frequency and capacitive behavior resembling a straight-line at low frequency. This appurtenance is attributed to the nanoflower structure of CZITSSe. The formation of the nanoflowers provides a wide surface area to absorb incident photons with minimum charge transfer resistance. The reduced Rct in EIS supplies a better electron path for the electron transformation in the CZITSSe-electrolyte edge, leading to improved conversion efficiency.73 The EIS data of I1, I2, I3 and I4 are in good agreement with its photovoltaic performance.

3.10.2 Bode plot of the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 thin films. 
The electron lifespan during the photoabsorption and transition at the CZITSSe-electrolyte interface in the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 photocathode was analyzed by Bode plot. Fig. 13 manifests the Bode phase plot CZITSSe as a function of the In3+ ion. The Bode phase data were done by plotting the phase angle obtained in the EIS measurement against the log of frequency (logF). From Fig. 13(a), the Bode plot shifts to higher values with an increment in the In3+ ion in the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 (0.0 to 0.075 M) films. The shifting in the Bode phase angle to a higher value (I4 sample) is ascribed to the compact nature of the nanoflower. The genesis of the compact nanoflowers in the I4 films (0.075 M) furnishes the surface compactness for the CZITSSe photoelectrode.74 The phase angles observed for samples I1 to I4 were −50.9° to −9.1°, respectively. Moreover, the CZITSSe thin film at x = 0.075 M In3+ ion manifests improved electrochemical performance compared to the I1, I2, and I3 samples.75Fig. 13(b) shows the Bode magnitude of the In3+-doped Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 films. The resistivity of the CZITSSe films decreases as the In3+ ion content increases (x = 0.075 M). Overall, the Bode phase measurement reveals that the conductivity of the deposited Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 (x = 0.0 to 0.075 M) absorber was enhanced with the increment in the In3+ content.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the one-step hydrothermal method was directly implemented to fabricate the prominent Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 (x = 0.0, 0.025, 0.05, 0.075 M) photocathode. The absorption studies revealed that the band gaps of the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 (0.0 to 0.075 M) films were reduced from 1.42 to 1.34 eV. XRD studies illustrated that the formation of the kesterite crystal structure with the shifting in the major peak confirms the substitution of Zn2+ by In3+ atoms in the CZITSSe thin films. FE-SEM analysis demonstrated the alteration in surface morphology from nanocubes to dense and compactly grown nanoflowers. The XPS analysis constituent elements of the CZITSSe film were found in the valence states of Cu+, Zn2+, In3+, Sn4+, S2−, and Se2− ions. The photovoltaic performance of CZITSSe revealed that the compact nanoflowers-like microstructures allowed for enhancing Voc and Jsc in the PEC cell. The boost in the conversion efficiency from 1.96% to 4.82% is ascribed to lower grain boundaries, Rs and Rct generated at the CZITSSe-electrolyte interface. The I–V measurements of the deposited photoelectrode reveals that improvement in conversion efficiency from 2.01 to 5.12% as function of In3+ ion concentration. The EIS analysis revealed the gradual decrease in Rct from 4970 to 35.1 Ω cm−2 and support the improved photovoltaic performance of the Cu2Zn1−xInxSn(S,Se)4 photoelectrode.
