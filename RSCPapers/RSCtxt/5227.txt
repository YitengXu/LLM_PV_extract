    , Accepted 16th November 2017First published on 29th November 2017AbstractControlled nanoscale assemblies of conjugated polymers are of considerable interest due to their potential for optimised energy transport properties. Recent progress in the development of conjugated block copolymers (BCPs) and their self-assembly have yielded controlled nanostructures unattainable using conventional synthesis via step-growth polymerisation. The self-assembly procedures, however, often require tedious and complicated manipulations during and/or after the polymerisation, and simple, efficient methods for the preparation of such conjugated block copolymer nanostructures have remained a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the preparation of fluorescent poly(p-phenylenevinylene) (PPV) BCP nanostructures in a dimensionally controlled manner through a simple, one-shot ring-opening metathesis polymerisation wherein the BCP formation and self-assembly occur simultaneously. The driving force of the in situ self-assembly is ascribed to the insolubility and the strong interchain π–π interactions of the core-forming block, making it possible to use a fluorescent block with low crystallinity. The introduction of an appropriate non-conjugated solubilizing block renders the nanostructures water-dispersible, and they exhibit a morphology-dependent fluorescence quenching response in the presence of trace amounts of nitroaromatics, including 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT). The quenching response shows remarkable discrimination against paraquat, a widely used electron-acceptor and a strong quencher, in favor of neutral analytes.
Introduction
Semiconducting polymers constitute key components in a wide range of organic electronic devices, such as solar cells,1–3 organic light-emitting diodes,4,5 transistors,6,7 and chemical sensors.8 The performance of such systems is contingent on the nanoscopic dimensionality of the semiconducting polymer domains that determine the energy transport characteristics. Recently, the self-assembly of block copolymers (BCPs) containing crystalline core-forming blocks in selective solvents made it possible to prepare uniform polymer nanostructures. The process, known as crystallization-driven self-assembly (CDSA),9,10 was also expanded to conjugated core-forming blocks such as polythiophene (PT)11–15 and oligo(p-phenylenevinylene) (OPV).16 To address the requirement of time-consuming post polymerisation self-assembly, often conducted under highly dilute conditions, Manners and coworkers, in 2017, demonstrated that the living anionic polymerisation of polyisoprene-b-poly(ferrocenyldimethylsilane) (PIP-b-PFDMS) in THF/hexanes, a solvent system selective for the PIP block, gave cylindrical nanostructures through one-pot polymerisation, crystallization, and assembly.17 Although the report represents a powerful method of creating controlled nanostructures directly from the synthesis, simple and scalable strategies for conjugated polymer nanostructures is also of importance.18,19
We have previously developed a facile method for the preparation of dimensionally controlled nanostructures from BCPs containing polyacetylene (PA) using ring-opening metathesis polymerisation (ROMP).20–22 The self-assembly occurs concurrently with polymer synthesis, and the nanostructures are obtained directly from the reaction mixture. Furthermore, the nanoscale morphology is controlled simply by the monomer feed ratio. The process, termed in situ nanoparticlization of conjugated polymers (INCP), is driven by the insolubility and strong interchain π–π interactions of non-substituted conjugated polymers,23–25 and constitute an alternate strategy for the preparation of non-spherical nanostructures without the need for crystallizing constituents. A distinct consequence of the driving force for the self-assembly during INCP is the robustness of the resulting nanostructure, the morphology of which is uninfluenced by processing solvents. We envisioned that such properties would allow us to evaluate the performance of dimensionally controlled conjugate polymer nanostructures in applications where energy transport properties play a crucial role,8 such as amplifying fluorescence sensing.
Herein, we report a simple and efficient strategy for one-shot preparation of dimensionally controlled fluorescent nanostructures containing BCP of an amplifying fluorescent polymer (AFP), PPV (Fig. 1). The fluorescent PPV block was obtained from the living ROMP of [2.2]paracyclophane-1,9-diene (PCPDE) with a negligible chain transfer reaction.26–28 By exploiting a dramatic difference in the reactivity of norbornene (NB) derivatives and PCPDE, various BCP microstructures could be produced directly from one-shot copolymerisation wherein NB, PCPDE, and catalyst are introduced simultaneously. By varying the monomer feed ratio and side chains of each block, control over the morphology of the resulting nanostructures was possible both in organic and aqueous solutions. Notably, the resulting water-dispersible fluorescent polymer nanostructures exhibited dimensionality-dependent, discriminative amplifying fluorescence sensing behavior toward trace amounts of explosive nitroaromatics, such as 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), over ionic interferants, with the Stern–Volmer quenching constants over 105 M−1.

Experimental
General experimental considerations
All reagents were commercially available from Acros, Alfa, Sigma Aldrich and TCI and used without further purification unless specified otherwise. 1,2-Dichloroethane was distilled under a nitrogen atmosphere over calcium hydride. All polymerisations were carried out under a dry argon atmosphere using standard Schlenk techniques. THF was distilled over sodium and benzophenone and anhydrous deuterium THF solvent (≥99.95%) were purchased from Euriso-Top®. THF solvents were degassed by argon bubbling for 10 minutes before using for polymerisation. The third generation Grubbs catalyst was prepared by the method reported previously.29 NMR spectra were recorded by using a Varian/Oxford As-500 (500 MHz for 1H/125 MHz for 13C) and a Bruker ultrashield spectrometer (600 MHz for 1H/150 MHz for 13C). UV/Vis spectra were obtained by using a V-630 and fluorescence spectra were obtained by using a FP-8300 (Jasco Inc.). Quantum efficiency was measured by using a QE-1200 (Otsuka Electronics). Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) data were obtained by using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS. Film state X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed by the National Instrumentation Center for Environmental Management (NICEM) at SNU using D8 Discover with GADDS (Bruker, Germany). IR spectra were recorded on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet 6700 spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out on a CHI 660 Electrochemical Analyzer (CH Instruments, Inc., Texas, USA) using a degassed acetonitrile solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6, 0.1 M). Quenching studies were conducted using a PerkinElmer LS55 spectrometer. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements were conducted using a Horiba Fluorolog-3 equipped with FL3-TCSPC. A pulsed LED (334 nm) was used as the light source and the intensity was measured at 505 nm, with a 450 nm cut-off filter being used.
General procedure for the one-shot INCP
Both comonomers (62.8 μmol for M1 or M2 and 6.28–37.7 μmol for PCPDE) were weighed into a 2 mL screw-cap vial with a septum and purged with argon. Anhydrous and degassed THF was added (43–360 μL) to the vial. THF solution of the third-generation Grubbs catalyst (1.26 μmol) was added (20 μL) to the monomer solution at once under vigorous stirring. The mixture was stirred for 4–12 h at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by excess ethyl vinyl ether. The crude mixture was precipitated into methanol (P1–P3) or cold ether at −78 °C (P4–P5), and the obtained powder or sticky gel was dried in vacuo.
Fluorescence quenching studies
20 mM solutions of DNT and TNT were prepared by dissolving appropriate amounts of each quencher in ethanol. Quencher stock solutions for fluorescence titration were prepared by diluting the 20 mM stock solutions by a factor of 200 with aqueous PPV BCP stock solution (2 × 10−6 M based on PPV repeating unit), so as to give the final quencher concentration of 0.1 mM and to make dilution effects negligible. The excitation wavelength used was 371 nm. For each quenching study, the initial fluorescence emission intensity was measured, followed by the addition of aliquots of the quencher stock solution. The fluorescence intensity was measured 20 minutes after each addition to allow sufficient time for equilibration. Measurements were performed in triplicate with R-squared values of >0.98 for each set of conditions.
Results and discussion
Polymer synthesis
The PPV BCPs were prepared from the living ROMP of two different types of monomers, NB derivatives (M1 and M2) for the solubilizing first block, and non-substituted PCPDE for the insoluble second block, using the highly active and fast initiating third-generation Grubbs catalyst in tetrahydrofuran (Table 1). Qualitative observations from our previous studies20,30 and those performed by other groups26–28 indicated that PCPDE derivatives polymerised at a much slower rate (typically requiring overnight reactions, even at elevated temperatures) than NB derivatives (complete conversion within minutes at room temperature). This led us to envision a one-shot copolymerisation wherein all necessary components (monomers, catalyst, and solvent) are introduced simultaneously to prepare BCPs. To quantitatively determine the polymerisation rate difference, time-dependent competitive monomer conversion was monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy at 0 °C (Fig. 2a, b, and Fig. S1†). As expected, a significant difference was observed in the propagation rates (kp of M1 being about 100 times greater than that of PCPDE), corresponding to the incorporation of a single PCPDE unit for every 48 repeating units of M1, and indicating that the one-shot copolymerisation produced well-defined BCP microstructures.

The conversion of M1 and PCPDE reached 95% and 6%, respectively, within 5 minutes. This represents a significant improvement compared to the previously reported one-shot ROMP from the mixtures of M1 and cyclooctatetraene (COT), in which 27% conversion of the slow-reacting COT was observed while the conversion of M1 reached 95%, yielding tapered copolymer architectures.20 The corresponding difference in the kp of M1 and COT was 24-fold. Although the ring strain of PCPDE (42 kcal mol−1)31 is nearly 15 kcal mol−1 higher than that of NB (27 kcal mol−1),32 the kp of PCPDE is significantly smaller because of the large steric hindrance of the phenyl rings that retard the approach of the catalyst (Fig. S2†).
To verify the similarities between the microstructures of the PPV BCPs obtained from the conventional sequential monomer addition and from the one-shot copolymerisation, their 1H NMR and UV/Vis absorbance spectra were compared (Fig. 2c, d and Fig. S3†). The nearly identical 1H NMR and UV/Vis absorbance spectra indicated that the blocky microstructure and the degree of conjugation of the PPV block were essentially the same, respectively, regardless of the synthetic procedure.20 Additionally, the PPV resonances were nearly absent in the 1H NMR spectra of both BCPs, suggesting the successful in situ formation of a core–shell structure with insoluble PPV cores from the polymerisation (Fig. 2c).
Nanoscale morphology of BCPs
Polymers with different side chains and various feed ratios were easily prepared using this simple, one-shot block copolymerisation (Table 1) and analyzed by dynamic light scattering (DLS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The DLS analysis of P1–P3 in chloroform without any post-synthetic treatment showed increasing hydrodynamic diameters (Dh) from 80 nm to 220 nm with an increase in the feed ratio of PCPDE from 10 to 30 (Fig. 3a), suggesting direct self-assembly during the one-shot copolymerisation. The AFM and TEM images of P1–P3 clearly show the evolution of nanostructures from spheres to rods by one-dimensional (1D) growth (with a maximum length of 300 nm) and then to multi-armed star-like micelles (Fig. 3c–e, h–j and Fig. S4†). Unlike typical worm-like BCP micelles, these nanocaterpillars and star-like structures showed undulating height profiles by AFM and loosely associated cores as observed by TEM. These observations suggest the formation of caterpillar-like structures, similar to those observed from PA BCPs (Fig. 3d, i (inset images), and Fig. S5†).20–22 Additionally, the size of the nanostructures measured from the AFM and TEM images was roughly consistent with their Dh from DLS, indicating that the nanostructures were preserved in solution. The samples taken during polymerisation without quenching and precipitation processes also showed the same morphological evolution with P1–P3, supporting in situ formation of nanostructures without any post-synthetic treatments (Fig. S6†).

AFM images (c–g) and TEM images (h–l) of nanostructures of BCPs prepared from chloroform solutions of P1–P3 and aqueous solutions of P4 and P5, respectively. 
The strategy of one-shot synthesis of PPV BCPs could be expanded to prepare water-dispersible polymer nanostructures using M2, a NB monomer containing a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) side chain as the solubilizing block. Well-defined BCPs with M2:PCPDE feed ratios of 50:5 and 50:15 were synthesised in a one-shot manner (Table 1, P4 and P5). The DLS, AFM, and TEM analyses of the resulting P4–P5 in aqueous solution also showed the structural evolution from spheres (P4, Dh = 70 nm) to nanocaterpillars (P5, Dh = 135 nm) by 1D growth (Fig. 3b, f, g, k, and l and Fig. S7, S8†), similar to that of P1–P2 in chloroform. Additionally, the same nanocaterpillar morphology was observed for P5 in both chloroform and aqueous solutions by cryo-TEM (Fig. S9†), indicating stable nanostructure formation that was unaffected by solvent change. Notably, this is the first example of a water-dispersible conjugated BCP nanostructure prepared by one-shot polymerisation, representing a promising strategy for a large-scale preparation of well-defined light-emitting polymer nanostructures. BCP nanostructures obtained from the conventional sequential monomer addition and one-shot polymerisation also produced identical structures (Tables S1, S2, and Fig. S10–S12†).
The mechanism of in situ self-assembly during the one-shot copolymerisation is proposed as follows (Fig. 4).21,23 After the rapid ROMP of the norbornene derivatives, the ROMP of PCPDE proceeds to give the insoluble PPV second block, which immediately forms nanospheres through strong π–π interactions. The propagating carbenes remain active in the cores, and the diffusion of PCPDE leads to further propagation and core expansion. This eventually gives rise to secondary assembly of the nanospheres to give kinetically trapped nanocaterpillar structures or star-like micelles at higher PCPDE loading.23 Unlike the conventional amphiphilic BCP micelles at equilibrium, core fusion is inhibited because of the low chain mobility of the PPV core, and these kinetically trapped micelles generated by INCP maintain their morphologies across different solvents, such as chloroform and water, due to their strong π–π interactions (Fig. 3 and Fig. S9†).
 Fig. 4  Proposed mechanism of stable PNB-PPV nanoparticle formation via one-shot INCP. 
The crystallinity of the PPV BCP nanostructures prepared from one-shot INCP was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), which showed a weak and broad signal at 4.05°, indicating a low crystallinity of the PPV domain, along with an interchain distance of the PNBCyH first block33 at 5.34 Å (P1–P3) and of PEG side chains at 4.37 Å (P4–P5)34 (Fig. S13†). The low crystallinity of the PPV core could be attributed to the high content of cis olefins, typical in the backbone of PPVs prepared via ROMP.27 The presence of cis olefins was further confirmed using FT-IR (Fig. S14†).35 These observations suggest that the low solubility of unsubstituted PPV and the strong interchain π–π interactions are the driving forces for INCP, rather than the crystallization of the core.
UV/Vis spectra of the PPV BCPs showed an absorption maximum at 380 nm in chloroform (P1–P3) and 375 nm in water (P4–P5), and an optical band gap of 2.6 eV (P1–P3), which were blue-shifted compared to those of conventional alkoxy-substituted MEH-PPV36,37 and more similar to those of alkyl substituted PPV synthesised by ROMP26 (Fig. S15 and Table S3†). The photoluminescence spectrum also showed a similar trend having an emission maximum at 491 nm (P1–P3) (Fig. S15†). The quantum yields of the nanoparticles were 17.5% and 3.3% (P5) in chloroform and aqueous solution, respectively (Table S4†). Cyclic voltammetry showed that the HOMO of the PPV BCP (P1–P3) is −5.6 eV, which is 0.3 eV lower than that of MEH-PPV (Fig. S16†).38,39 These lower optoelectronic values may be attributed to the absence of electron-donating alkoxy substituents and the mixed cis/trans configuration of the PPV backbone.26,28,40
Sensing studies
Fluorescent conjugated polymers are known for their extraordinary performance as chemical sensors, and are often called AFPs.8 In AFPs, the dimensionality of exciton migration plays a crucial role in their sensitivity. In the solid state, where extended intra- and interchain electronic interactions are possible, efficient three-dimensional transport of excitons leads to remarkable sensitivity towards analytes which can interact with the π-electronic structures of AFP, leading to strong fluorescence quenching in the presence of trace amounts of analytes.41,42 In solution, however, the reduced sensitivity attributed to a one-dimensional random walk of excitons confined to individual unimeric polymer chains leads to significant reduction in sensitivity. Therefore, strategies for using AFPs in solution-phase chemosensing have relied exclusively on enhancing the strength of the polymer–analyte binding constant by employing conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) to detect oppositely charged molecules,43–45 a scheme intrinsically dependent on the acidity and ionic strength of the media.46 The selective detection of neutral analytes over ionic interferants in water is critical. For example, the selective detection of neutral nitroaromatic analytes in water is important in sensing buried explosives and/or measuring water contamination levels.47 CPEs are quenched by neutral nitroaromatics in water,48 but with sensitivities three orders of magnitude lower than that of paraquat, a positively charged electron-poor quencher. Dimensionally controlled, water-dispersible nanostructures of AFPs capable of excluding charged analytes would therefore be of considerable importance.
To test the potential of using PPV BCP nanostructures as chemosensors, fluorescence titration studies of P4 and P5 were carried out using 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) and TNT as analytes in water (Fig. 5 and Fig. S17–S20†). The results showed a strong dependence of the sensory response on the nanoscale morphology of PPV BCPs. Approximately 30 μM TNT was required to quench 40% of the fluorescence of spherical nanostructures of P4, whereas a similar degree of quenching was obtained even with only 1 μM TNT using linear P5 (Fig. 5a). The corresponding Stern–Volmer plot showed a linear relationship (Fig. 5b), and the KSV of P5 was 3.9 × 105 M−1, which is 26-fold higher than that of P4 (1.5 × 104 M−1). The KSV value for P5 is higher than previously-reported aggregated AFP-based systems, such as light-emitting oligosilole nanoparticles (KSV = 5.0 × 103 M−1),49 and pyrene-containing conjugated fluorescent polymer thin films (KSV = 3.26 × 104 M−1).50 Furthermore, the sensitivity of P5 is significantly greater than other known classes of fluorescence-based aqueous-phase sensors for TNT, including a pentacene-based small molecule,51 pyrene nanocomposites,52 and metal–organic frameworks (Table S5†).53 The fluorescence quenching was visually detectable, even at very low TNT concentrations (0.5 ppm, Fig. 5c). In both P4 and P5, the KSV values for DNT were lower than those for TNT by a factor of approximately 5, but P5 still showed a 22-fold higher sensory performance than P4 (3.3 × 103 M−1 for P4 and 7.2 × 104 M−1 for P5, Fig. 5b). Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements using the aqueous solutions of P4 showed decay profiles that were unaltered in the presence of DNT (Fig. S21†), suggesting that static quenching is the predominant quenching mechanism.

(d) The Stern–Volmer plot of the fluorescence quenching of P5 with TNT in 1 mM aqueous PQ. 
The increase in the degree of polymerisation (from 5 to 15) of the PPV domain alone does not account for this more than 20-fold increase in the quenching efficiency between P4 and P5. Previous studies on dilute solutions of soluble poly(p-phenyleneethynylene) (PPE) showed that the increase in molecular weight enhances KSV (in the molecular weight ranges below the exciton migration length), but with a proportionality of less than 1 (i.e. the degree of KSV enhancement is smaller than that of the molecular weight increase).54 Moreover, adding a small amount of a poor solvent to the PPE solutions to induce aggregation led to a much greater increase in KSV.42 Our one-shot INCP strategy makes it possible to tune the sensory performance of AFPs by controlling the dimensionality of BCP nanostructures without altering the solvent environment. This aspect is crucial for consistent solution-phase sensing applications.
To test the ability of the PPV BCP nanostructures to serve as discriminative sensors for neutrally charged analytes, quenching studies were performed using paraquat dichloride (PQ), a strong electron acceptor and a widely used quenching agent. When a solution of the linear P5 was treated with PQ, only a weak quenching response, with a KSV of 5.1 × 102 M−1, was obtained (Fig. 5b and Fig. S22†). This small quenching efficiency of the PPV BCP toward PQ, despite the high efficiency of the photoinduced charge-transfer reported between unsubstituted PPV and ethyl viologen,55 could be ascribed to the suppressed penetration of the highly charged PQ across the PEG corona layer, preventing quenching interactions with the PPV core. Furthermore, the presence of PQ did not affect the quenching response of P5 towards TNT. Fluorescence titration measurement of P5 in 1 mM aqueous PQ with TNT showed a nearly identical quenching efficiency (KSV = 4.1 × 105 M−1, Fig. 5d and Fig. S23†) as that obtained from deionised water. To the best of our knowledge, these results constitute the first example of highly discriminative sensing of neutral nitroaromatics over PQ in water using AFPs.
The sensor performance of P5 in the presence of sodium chloride exhibited enhancement with an increase in salt concentration (Fig. 6). In saturated sodium chloride solution, a KSV value of greater than 106 M−1 was obtained. The enhancement of the quenching constant in the presence of dissolved sodium chloride is attributed to the salting-out effect. The ability of P5 to act as a highly sensitive fluorescence sensor in high ionic-strength solutions makes the system promising for field applications.

With the potential for further fine-tuning of the electronic structure of the PPV core block through chemical modification, and also for achieving even higher dimensionality nanostructures through variations in the monomer structure and feed ratio, this one-shot INCP of PPV BCPs represents a highly promising platform for aqueous-phase sensing of various neutral aromatic analytes.
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a simple and efficient one-shot preparation of nanoparticles from amphiphilic fluorescent conjugated BCPs. The significant difference (nearly a factor of 100) in the polymerisation rate between NB derivatives and PCPDE enabled the one-shot block copolymerisation and spontaneous in situ nanoparticlization induced by the strong π–π interactions among the second PPV block. Various nanostructures, ranging from micelles and nanocaterpillars to multi-armed star-like micelles, were obtained simply by increasing the PCPDE feed ratio. The water-dispersible PPV BCP nanostructures showed a powerful quenching response towards trace amounts of explosive nitroaromatics in water (KSV up to 4 × 105 M−1). Notably, the discriminative detection of TNT over PQ was achieved, with the KSV of TNT being three orders of magnitude greater than that of PQ. Effective shielding against charged interferants in water makes this fluorescence sensing scheme a promising platform for further applications. The potential for variations in the electronic structure of fluorescent cores, along with the control over the dimensionality of the structures, may allow for further optimization of PPV BCP nanostructures to target other aromatic contaminants in water. This high-performance sensor application is the first application of INCP-prepared nanoparticles for useful optoelectronics and shows the power of the one-shot INCP as a new synthetic platform for a rapid, scalable preparation of semiconducting polymer nanostructures with tailor-made nanoscale morphologies.
