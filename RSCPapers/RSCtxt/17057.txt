Conversion of lignin by depolymerization to aromatic monomers has attracted more and more interest in recent years. The electro-oxidative depolymerization of lignin with renewable electricity pertains to be a versatile and sustainable method because it can be performed under relatively mild conditions and it is easy to control the reaction degree. In this work, we have reviewed recent research progress in the electro-oxidative depolymerization of lignin for value-added products, focusing on the catalysts, electrodes, processes, electrocatalytic systems and additives, as well as the challenges faced in potential application of the technologies. It is recommended that more efficient electrocatalysts should be developed with regards to activity, selectivity and stability for direct use in the electro-oxidative depolymerization of lignin. New technology with less pollution and high selectivity should be developed for efficient recovery and purification of target aromatic products from the mixture of various degradation products. Understanding of the mechanisms of lignin depolymerization by electro-oxidation should be deepened, which will guide the design of catalysts and processes for increasing the yield of the desired target product.Daihong GaoMiss Daihong Gao is a PhD student in the Department of Chemical Engineering, Tsinghua University, China.

1. Introduction
The current extensive use of fossil resources has led to a continuous increase in the emission of greenhouse gases, and the governments of many countries have proposed carbon reduction to alleviate global warming and climate change.1,2 Therefore, more and more attention has been paid to the use of renewable, carbon-neutral biomass as a resource for the production of renewable energy and products.3–5 One of the main components of lignocellulosic biomass, lignin is a complex three-dimensional network polymer composed of phenylpropane units. It is the only biopolymer in nature composed of an aromatic ring skeleton.6,7 Therefore, lignin can be converted into aromatic aldehydes, aromatic ketones, phenols, and other benzene derivatives, as well as aliphatic compounds that can partially or completely substitute for petroleum in the production of bulk or fine chemicals.8
The global industrial lignin produced by the pulp and paper industries exceeds 50 million tons each year, but less than 5% of the lignin is further used for high-value products, and most of the rest is burned or discharged as waste.9 There are some challenges in the high-value-added utilization of lignin. First, at the material level, lignin has strong biological recalcitrance. The presence of lignin imparts rigidity to the plant, allowing the xylem to maintain a high hardness to support the plant's weight.10–12 Second, at the molecular level, lignin is complex and heterogeneous, consisting of three structural units: p-hydroxyphenyl, guaiacyl, and syringyl subunits. The relative contents of these monomeric units are related to many factors, such as plant species, growth cycle, extraction method, etc.13–16 Third, at the atomic level, the C–C and C–O–C bonds between lignin constituent units have high bond dissociation energy, reported to be around 218–314 kJ mol−1, making it tough to break easily.17 Due to the aforementioned reasons, depolymerization of lignin into the desired platform chemicals with high selectivity is difficult. Researchers are attempting to improve lignin's added value and promote its commercialization. At present, only a few phenolic compounds have achieved large-scale production through lignin depolymerization. For example, vanillin was the first aromatic chemical commercially produced. The annual output of vanillin directly converted from lignin reaches 3000 tons per year, accounting for 15% of total vanillin production.18 More functionalized value-added compounds can be produced by the oxidative depolymerization of lignin. Therefore, the development of efficient catalytic methods for the oxidative depolymerization of lignin will greatly promote the value-added utilization of lignin, and different catalytic methods will lead to the formation of different products.
Currently, various chemical approaches have been developed for the depolymerization of lignin, and oxidative depolymerization pertains to be a versatile method because it can be performed under relatively mild conditions and it is easy to control the reaction degree. The C–C bonds and aryl ethers between lignin units can be oxidatively cleaved by using oxidants such as O2, H2O2, Ph-NO2, etc., under the catalysis of some metal salts or oxides,19 and relatively satisfying yields of objective products can be obtained. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the chemicals formed by the oxidative depolymerization of lignin are various.20 Under the action of different catalytic systems, the side chains, phenolic hydroxyl groups, and aromatic rings of lignin can be selectively oxidized, resulting in a variety of platform compounds with unique properties. The aromatic ring structure of lignin is conserved when the side chain of lignin is selectively oxidized, which can produce a series of phenolic compounds. Furthermore, the functional groups on the side chains undergo oxidation, and this may result in the formation of aromatic aldehydes, acids and ketones, among which aromatic aldehydes have attracted the most interest. In this regard, Beckham et al. revisited the alkaline aerobic oxidative depolymerization of lignin.21 The yield of aromatic monomers obtained by catalytic wet aerobic oxidation is over 30%, and the yield of aromatic aldehydes is higher than 25%. However, the yields are greatly dependent on the type of raw lignin material. In recent work, Rawat and his co-workers found that using O2 as the oxidant and MoPO/CeO2 as a catalyst, 55% soluble oil could be obtained, including 12.5% total monomers, and 9% vanillin.22 However, most of the chemical depolymerization processes of lignin need relatively harsh conditions at high temperature and high pressure. In addition, organic solvents are usually used, resulting in the risk of environmental pollution and potential safety hazards. Therefore, greener and more sustainable methods should be developed to overcome these drawbacks.

The electro-oxidative depolymerization of lignin can be carried out under mild conditions, and is an environment-friendly and promising method. Electricity can be employed as a driving force and the depolymerization process can be carried out under ambient conditions without high temperature and high pressure. Electrocatalysis alters redox reactions through the input of electrons instead of adding additional oxidants or reducing agents. In addition, electrocatalysis can adjust the selectivity of the reaction through control of the voltage or current density.23 By using renewable electricity as the power source, the electrochemical depolymerization process of lignin may achieve greater carbon negativity. Therefore, electrocatalysis is an atomically efficient, intrinsically safe, and inexpensive method. A brief comparison of thermal catalytic oxidation and electrocatalytic oxidation of lignin is summarized in Table 1. However, the electrochemical depolymerization of lignin is still in the early stage of exploration. So far, there have been a few reviews on the electrocatalytic lignin valorization,23–25 and most of them are focused on the reaction of model compounds,26,27 but research on the depolymerization of the lignin macromolecule is vague and without discussion of details. Therefore, in this article, we have reviewed the recent research progress on the electro-oxidative depolymerization of lignin for value-added products, focusing on the catalysts, electrodes, processes, electrocatalytic systems and additives, as well as the challenges faced in the potential application of the technologies.

2. Electrocatalytic conversion of lignin
Electro-oxidation of lignin is usually conducted in single- or double-chamber electrolytic cells, as shown in Fig. 2. Lignin can be oxidized in an electrolytic cell primarily in two forms, namely direct and indirect oxidation.23,25 Direct electro-oxidation refers to the process of depolymerization of lignin taking place on the electrode surface directly. Specifically, lignin loses electrons under the effect of the catalyst on the electrode surface and then is oxidized into specific products. The catalyst on the electrode is reduced, and driven by the applied potential, the reduced catalyst is re-oxidized and returns to its original state. Indirect electro-oxidation refers to the addition of a mediator to the electrolysis system, and its redox state serves as the key electron carrier for the electro-oxidation of lignin. First, the mediator oxidizes the lignin in the bulk solution, and then the reduced mediator loses electrons on the electrode surface to get regenerated. Due to its simplicity and convenience, the first strategy is usually used to oxidize lignin,28–31 while the second strategy is more employed to oxidize lignin model compounds.32,33 However, the relatively large molecular size of lignin may prevent direct adsorption onto the electrode surface for heterogeneous reactions, while the mediator can shuttle freely between the electrode surface and the bulk electrolyte, acting as an electron carrier for better homogeneous reaction with lignin.23 Unfortunately, few investigations on the electro-oxidation of lignin including mediators have been conducted due to the complex degradation mechanisms. The essence of the electrochemical degradation of lignin is mainly ascribed to the cleavage of C–C or C–O bonds of the phenylpropane units to generate monomers for producing high-value-added chemicals. At present, the efficiency of electro-oxidative depolymerization of lignin is still at a relatively low level, and it is necessary to further analyze the competitive reactions to better intensify the yield of objective products.
 Fig. 2  Strategies of electrochemical oxidation of lignin in electrolytic cells. 
In recent years, many studies have been reported on the electro-oxidation of lignin, but the intended purposes are different. These studies generally can be divided into three categories. The first is to modify lignin macromolecules, such as increasing the content of carboxyl groups to improve hydrophilicity and metal chelating ability.34 The second is to treat lignin as industrial wastewater for complete oxidative degradation,35–37 reducing the chemical oxygen demand (COD) value as much as possible, and thus reducing environmental pollution. The goal of this process is mainly to mineralize lignin into CO2. The third is to convert lignin into biomass platform compounds, mainly including bulk or fine chemicals such as aromatic aldehydes, aromatic acids, aromatic ketones, and short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids.28,31,38–41 The third category of electro-oxidation of lignin allows the greatest value-added transformation of lignin. Electro-oxidative depolymerization of lignin to produce value-added products has made much progress in recent decades, and the representative trials are shown in Table 2. However, it is evident that this is the most challenging path because it requires sufficient selectivity to avoid excessive oxidation of lignin. Furthermore, processes involving free radicals during oxidation may result in lower product yields due to the re-condensation of the lignin degradation product. Ideally, electrocatalytic oxidation processes should enable efficient depolymerization under mild conditions, allowing for direct conversion of lignin into value-added products including alcohols, aldehydes, or carboxylic acids.42 Practically, the degree of depolymerization of lignin by electro-oxidation is influenced by various factors including the electrode materials, catalysts, solvent systems, auxiliary additives, etc. Various depolymerization systems have been designed for different applications or desired products. However, even so, the reported product distribution and yields of desired products by electrolysis still vary across a wide range as indicated by Table 2. This is because the isolated lignin might be significantly different in chemical structure from different plant species and isolation processes, and the operating conditions of the electrolysis process also have great effects on the product yields and distribution. Therefore, separation and post-treatment of the products after lignin degradation is also important, since the obtained mixture usually contains plenty of depolymerization products.

2.1 Electrocatalysts
The anode catalysts play a very important role in the efficiency of oxidation of lignin, as reflected by the lignin conversion rate and product selectivity. The ideal anode catalysts should be corrosion resistant as well as of high catalytic activity for lignin depolymerization.25,51 The most common heterogeneous electrocatalysts currently used for the electrochemical depolymerization of lignin are mainly metals and metal oxides that have redox reversibility for accepting and releasing electrons.

2.1.1 Nickel, cobalt metals and their hydroxides. 
Nickel-based materials are the most classic electrode catalysts for oxidative degradation of lignin. They have excellent stability in strong alkaline electrolytes, are less expensive and more available than noble metals, and have incomparable advantages over toxic metals. Because of the formation of stable oxide and hydroxide electrocatalytic surface layers in alkaline electrolytes, the electrode has good anti-corrosion stability. Nickel-based materials have good catalytic activity for lignin. During the anodization process, NiOOH species with electrocatalytic activity are formed on the surface of the nickel anode, which can directly break down lignin linkages and generate Ni(OH)2, while the Ni(OH)2 on the anode further loses electrons to regenerate NiOOH species, achieving recycling.43,52
Smith et al. used nickel electrodes in a batch pressure cell and flow reactor for anodic oxidative cracking of lignosulfonate, allowing electrolysis of up to 150 g of lignin at various electrode configurations up to 12 A. The electrolyzer was operated at 145 °C/5 bar/3 M NaOH, and yields of vanillin were similar to those obtained commercially using chemical oxidants (about 5–7%). Vanillin production is favored by low current density and low initial lignosulfonate concentration. However, the disadvantage of this process is that it needs to be carried out under harsh reaction conditions at high temperature and high pressure.43 Similarly, Zirbes et al. used a flat nickel electrode to electrolyze kraft lignin at high temperature, and the reaction parameters were optimized to increase the vanillin yield from 0.58% at room temperature to 4.2% at 160 °C, which is 67% of that obtained by nitrobenzene oxidation.40 This research group used a high-temperature electrolysis reactor to electrochemically depolymerize technical organosolv lignins (spruce, beech, wheat straw, etc.), and compared the effects of different sources of organosolv lignin on the yields of aromatic compounds. As shown in Scheme 1, under the optimized conditions, the yield of vanillin was as high as 4.0%, while the total yield of aromatic compounds was 7.8%.30 Yan et al. reported an electrochemical method for depolymerization of three ethanol organosolv lignins (EOL-SW, EOL-AS, and EOL-LP) using low-cost nickel foam as the working electrode under alkaline conditions, with vanillin and syringaldehyde as the principal depolymerization products. By electrolysis at 0.5 V vs. Hg/HgO for 1 h, the maximal yield of vanillin and syringaldehyde of EOL-SW reached 17.5%.50
 Scheme 1  Electrochemical depolymerization of organosolv lignin conducted by Zirbes et al.30 
The chemical relationship between Ni and Co implies similar electrocatalytic behavior. Schmitt et al. investigated the effect of different anode materials on vanillin yield and optimized the reaction parameters of the electrochemical process. They found that using a nickel foam electrode, the highest vanillin yield was obtained at the current density of 38 mA cm−2, reaction temperature of 80 °C, and applied current of 1500 C g−1. Furthermore, the studies revealed that using Co-based material Stellite 21 as the anode catalyst resulted in a yield of depolymerized product vanillin of up to 1.8% yield, which was higher than that of nickel-based material. However, cobalt-based alloys show some corrosion, resulting in mass loss. Cobalt oxides can be formed on the electrode surface, which will suspend in the electrolyte in small amounts, whereas nickel-based materials are much more stable. Researchers have found that 3D nickel-based materials can significantly improve the yield of vanillin compared with planar electrodes due to the increased specific surface area.53
Zirbes et al. investigated the suitability of various commercially available nickel- and cobalt-based transition metal alloys for the electrochemical oxidative degradation of lignin in alkaline media. Being similar to the previous studies, cobalt-based materials have better selectivity and generally lead to higher yields of vanillin, but they are prone to corrosion. For nickel-based materials, the electrochemical oxidative degradation of lignin is controlled by the redox couple of Ni(OH)2/NiOOH. The results showed that the electrochemical oxidative degradation of kraft lignin with the continuously used nickel foam electrode resulted in an increased yield of vanillin from 0.6 to 0.9%. Through FAPA MS characterization, it was found that the continuously used nickel foam electrode adsorbed diaminotoluene in black liquor, and the organic layer formed a catalytically active layer on the surface of the electrode. The organic layer on the electrode surface can affect the adsorption and oxidative degradation of lignin by affecting the electrode surface potential, lipophilicity, and interaction with lignin particles, which further improves the yield of vanillin.31
Movil et al. synthesized carbon catalysts loaded with non-precious metal nanoparticles Ni and Co (Ni/C, Co/C, Ni Co/C). Oxidation of lignin occurs below the overpotential required for oxygen evolution, and this low-potential (low-energy) anodizing process can significantly reduce hydrogen generation costs. However, this work was mainly focused on the demonstration that non-precious metal alloy nanoparticles can efficiently oxidize lignin, which reduces the cell voltage and the cost of hydrogen generation compared with water electrolysis, but the lignin degradation products were not examined in depth in this work.54
Ghahremani et al. electrodeposited different ratios of nickel and cobalt on titanium foil as an electrocatalytic anode for lignin degradation. Titanium was adopted as the substrate because of its mechanical stability, excellent corrosion resistance, long operating life, and uniform electrical conductivity. It was found that the incorporation of Co significantly reduced the onset potential of lignin oxidation, which is owing to the structural defects of Ni(OH)2 caused by the doping of Co in Ni(OH)2, making more active sites for lignin oxidation, which facilitates electron transfer during oxidation. Bimetallic or multimetallic electrocatalysts exhibit synergistic properties, which lead to higher chemical activity and stability of the catalysts. Under the optimized operating conditions, using the Ni2–Co8/Ti electrocatalyst, the yield of vanillin was 31.6 × 10−2 g kg−1 lignin h−1.49


2.1.2 Lead dioxide. 
Lead dioxide (PbO2) is a common anode for oxidizing organic contaminants because of its great oxidizing ability. PbO2 electrodes are less expensive and easier to prepare than noble metal electrodes. PbO2 also has strong chemical stability, especially in acidic solutions, and has relatively high overpotential for oxygen evolution reactions. The PbO2 electrode is regarded as an outstanding metal oxide electrode, and it is receiving more and more attention as an anode electrode material in the field of electrochemical degradation treatment of organic wastewater.55,56 However, the material is extremely poisonous and unstable in strongly alkaline aqueous solutions, which limits its application on a large scale. Nevertheless, PbO2 electrodes can be modified to improve their electrocatalytic performance.
Xu et al. prepared [Fe(CN)6]3−-doped PbO2 electrodes by the electrodeposition method for the electrochemical degradation of alkali lignin (AL). The [Fe(CN)6]3− anion was doped into the PbO2 matrix due to migration, which increased the average grain size of PbO2 and enabled it to form a dense surface coating. Compared with the conventional PbO2 electrode, the modified electrode exhibited superior stability, higher oxygen evolution potential, and better electrochemical activity for lignin degradation. In the electrochemical lignin degradation test, the apparent kinetic coefficient of the FeCN–PbO2 electrode was 0.00609 min−1, which was higher than that of the unmodified PbO2 electrode (0.00419 min−1). The researchers also investigated the impacts of experimental parameters such as applied current density, initial alkali lignin concentration, initial pH value, and solution temperature on the electrochemical degradation of alkali lignin at FeCN–PbO2 electrodes.35 However, the purpose of this study was to treat industrial wastewater containing lignin and reduce the COD value, but no further analysis of the degradation products was performed.
Chen et al. fabricated Ti/TiO2NT/PbO2 electrodes. TiO2 nanotubes were grown directly on titanium substrates by electrochemical anodization, and PbO2 nanoparticles were deposited on TiO2 nanotubes by photochemical and electrochemical deposition. The detection of changes in COD of lignin solution before and after oxidation proved that the electrode can effectively degrade lignin. However, the work was aimed at treating lignin wastewater rather than producing value-added chemicals.36
Zhang et al. used a three-electrode system with Pb/PbO2 as anode, copper as cathode, and saturated calomel electrode as reference electrode to degrade lignin to 2,6-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-methyl phenol (BHT) in alkaline solution. Lignin was oxidized by superoxide anion radicals (O2˙−) on the surface of the Pb/PbO2 electrode, breaking the bonds between phenylpropanoids. As shown in Scheme 2, when the current density was 25 mA cm−2 and electrolysis time was 3 h, the maximum yield of BHT was 7.0%. When the current density was 40 mA cm−2 and the electrolysis time was 0.5 h, the maximum yield of vanillin was 8.4%.57 Wang et al. used the three-dimensional electrode (TDE) reactor with Pb/PbO2 electrode for electrocatalytic degradation of aspen lignin. β-PbO2 crystals could promote the generation of hydroxyl radicals near the anode. When the electrolysis was performed at a concentration of poplar lignin of 40 g L−1, current density of 50 mA cm−2, and temperature of 50 °C, in the second hour of electrolysis, the yields of vanillin, syringaldehyde, and 4-methyl anisole were 3.2%, 1.2%, and 6.5%, respectively. After multiple electrolysis, the cumulative yield of 4-methyl anisole reached 343.3 g kg−1 lignin.58 Liu et al. used Pb/PbO2 anode and copper cathode for electrochemical depolymerization of bamboo lignin in alkaline solution, and 24 depolymerization products were identified by GC-MS. The optimized operating conditions were 1 mol L−1 NaOH solution, lignin concentration of 40 g L−1, current density of 20 mA cm−2, temperature of 40 °C, reaction time of 2 hours, which resulted in the yields of vanillin, syringaldehyde, and p-coumaric acid of 3.6%, 5.7% and 3.0%, respectively.48

2.1.3 Iridium and ruthenium and other precious metal oxides. 
The IrO2 electrode is a common electrode for lignin depolymerization due to its high electrocatalytic activity and stability, and it is a dimensionally stable anode (DSA). Tolba et al. fabricated four IrO2-based electrodes (Ti/Ta2O5–IrO2, Ti/SnO2–IrO2, Ti/RuO2–IrO2, and Ti/TiO2–IrO2) using the thermal decomposition method to depolymerize lignin.59 The performance of the IrO2 electrode was further improved by adding 30% metal oxide, and the CV, CP, and EIS characterizations indicated that Ti/Ta2O5–IrO2 had the largest electrochemically active area. According to the apparent kinetic rate constant calculated from the change of lignin concentration, Ti/RuO2–IrO2 has the highest lignin oxidation activity, and Ti/Ta2O5–IrO2 has the worst catalytic activity. Therefore, electrochemical curves such as CV may not accurately reflect the catalytic activity of anode materials. Furthermore, the CV curve current decreased after adding lignin, indicating that lignin oxidation is a slower process than oxygen evolution. Shao et al. observed a similar phenomenon when they used Ti/Sb–SnO2 and Ti/PbO2 as electrode materials to oxidatively degrade lignin, and the CV curve current rarely changed or decreased after adding lignin.60 Finally, HPLC analysis revealed that the electrochemical oxidation of lignin produced the major intermediates vanillin and vanillic acid. Regrettably, the researchers did not perform a rigorous quantitative analysis of these two compounds.
Zhu et al. designed a non-membrane cylindrical electrolytic cell with an inner cylindrical graphite felt cathode and an outer RuO2–IrO2/Ti mesh anode for lignin depolymerization in alkaline aqueous solution. In this cell, the by-product O2 on the anode can be effectively reduced in situ to H2O2 on the cathode. Subsequently, this part of H2O2 can be further decomposed into a series of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (HO˙, O2˙−, HOO˙, etc.) to enhance the depolymerization of lignin. Finally, lignin in the electrolyte is directly electro-oxidized on the anode, and the other part is chemically oxidized by H2O2 formed on the cathode. Depolymerization of lignin is achieved by the synergistic oxidation of electrochemical and chemical methods.61 As shown in Scheme 3, at a current density of 8 mA cm−2 and additional oxygen supplementation at 80 °C for 1 h, 59.2% of the lignin was depolymerized into low-molecular-weight products (such as aldehydes, ketones, phenols, and acids). However, the reaction is non-selective and more than two dozen aromatic monomers and dimers are obtained.62

Chen et al. developed a TiO2/Ti/Ta2O5–IrO2 photocatalyst to degrade kraft lignin, in which TiO2 nanotube arrays were used as photocatalysts and Ta2O5/IrO2 thin films were used as electrocatalysts. The researchers used UV-Vis spectroscopy to monitor the lignin degradation process and confirmed that the generated intermediates included vanillin and vanillic acid using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), but no quantitative analysis was done in their work.63


2.1.4 Titanium, vanadium, chromium, manganese, iron, copper, and other alloys. 
In addition to the above-mentioned metals commonly used as anode catalysts, other transition metals and their alloys are also used as working electrodes for the electrolysis of lignin. Parpot et al. used Pt, Au, Ni, Cu, DSA-O2, and PbO2 as anodes to investigate the electrochemical oxidative degradation of kraft lignin to produce vanillin. They found that the lignin oxidation was driven by reactive oxygen species on the electrode surface; furthermore, the applied current density influenced the conversion and yield, while the properties of the electrode affected the reaction rate.64 The results demonstrated that vanillin yields were low in all cases, never exceeding 10% mass conversion of the initial kraft lignin; however, the authors did not provide statistics on absolute vanillin yields.
Rauber et al. prepared ternary electrodes by doping Mn, Pd, V, and Ti transition metals based on binary metal oxide RuxIryOz. The researchers revealed that the anode metal material has a significant impact on the distribution of lignin degradation products: the Ru0.2Mn0.2Ir0.6Ox electrode tends to form p-coumaric acid, the Ru0.2Pd0.2Ir0.6Ox electrode tends to form 4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxy cinnamaldehyde, the Ru0.2V0.2Ir0.6Ox electrode tends to form 4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxy acetophenone, and the Ru0.2Ti0.2Ir0.6Ox has higher selectivity to vanillin.51 However, the authors did not provide exact yields for each aromatic chemical.
Singh et al. used stainless steel (SS-304) as an anode for galvanostatic oxidation of wheat straw and bagasse alkali lignin. They proposed a kinetic model for the electro-oxidation of lignin to vanillin, and found that the types of by-products produced during the degradation process were mainly 4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl ethanone and 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, as shown in Scheme 4. During the electro-oxidation process, the vanillin concentration first increased and then decreased. The maximum yields of vanillin from oxidative degradation of wheat straw and bagasse alkali lignin were 6% and 6.6%, respectively.47

In addition to the role played by these transition metals in the anode, some researchers have also studied the effects of different metal cathode materials on lignin degradation. Cai et al. used Pb/PbO2 as the anode to provide hydroxyl radicals to oxidatively decompose lignin to generate small molecule intermediates, and Cu/Ni Mo–Co as the cathode for electrocatalytic reduction and hydrogenation of lignin intermediates to produce renewable chemicals. By GC-MS analysis, 24 compounds were identified in the degradation products of corn stover alkali lignin. Under the optimal conditions, after repeated extraction and degradation, trans-ferulic acid (2.24%), vanillin (1.11%), 3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl-ethanone (0.24%), syringaldehyde (1.00%), acetosyringone (0.70%), 4-methoxy-3-methyl-phenol (3.88%) and other high value-added chemicals were obtained.28 Jia et al. used Ti/SnO2–Sb2O3/α-PbO2/β-PbO2 as an anode to oxidatively degrade straw lignin to obtain oxidation products (aromatic aldehydes, ketones, acids), and Fe, Sn, Cu-doped titanium foil as a cathode for electro-reduction and hydrogenation to produce reduction products (phenols, aromatic esters, etc.). The authors pointed out that the key to electrochemical degradation of lignin is to control the potential value to avoid hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reaction. They optimized the operating conditions and obtained 16 degradation products with a total yield of 3.3% of aromatic monomers, including 0.41% aromatic ketones (2-hydroxy-5-methylacetophenone, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenylacetone, acetovanillone, 3,4-dimethoxy acetophenone and acetosyringone), 0.15% aromatic aldehydes (vanillin and syringaldehyde), and 2.4% aromatic acids (p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and 3-phenyl propionic acid). The yields of reduction products were 0.2% phenols (guaiacol, 2,6-dimethoxyphenol and dihydroeugenol), 0.04% aromatic ester (isobutyl 4-hydroxybenzoate) and 0.07% aromatic hydrocarbons (1,2,3-trimethoxybenzene and 3,4,5-trimethoxytoluene).65 Some researchers used alloy materials directly as electrodes to degrade lignin because the oxide layer deposited or coated on the electrode substrate is easily removed in strong alkali or acid solutions. Chen et al. used 304 alloy steel, FeW9Cr4Mo3V, and FeW9Cr4V5Co3 as cathodes for electrolysis of wheat straw lignin for 5 h under optimal conditions. The obtained products were found to be guaiacol (0.11%), 4-ethyl guaiacol (0.04%), 4-propyl guaiacol (0.10%), vanillin (0.38%), acetovanillone (0.12%) and other products.66

2.2 Electrolyte systems
Most studies on the electrochemical degradation of lignin are carried out in an alkaline aqueous electrolyte system,31,49,50,59–61,67 because lignin contains phenolic hydroxyl groups and thus can form phenolic salts with a certain solubility in alkaline solution. Furthermore, lignin electrolysis in an alkaline aqueous solution can be integrated with the hydrogen generation process.68 Since the oxidation potential of lignin is lower than the oxygen evolution potential, hydrogen can be produced at lower potential in the electrolyzer, thereby reducing the production cost.54 Therefore, the pH of the electrolyte shows significant effects on the electrolytic performance of lignin depolymerization and the side reactions. On one hand, the pH of the electrolyte affects the conductivity of the solution, nucleophilic attack behavior of OH−, and mass transfer of the substrate, which in turn affects the reaction rate or types in solution. The increase in alkali concentration is conducive to breaking the linking bonds in lignin, and then obtaining the target product. When the alkali concentration increases to a certain value, the condensation reaction of the lignin intermediate will be more serious, which is not conducive to the accumulation of the target product. Furthermore, with the increase of alkali concentration, the oxygen evolution reaction that is the competitive reaction of oxidative depolymerization of lignin will be enhanced. For instance, Zirbes et al. studied the anodic degradation of lignin at active transition metal-based alloys and the effect of the basicity of the system. They found that the maximum yield of vanillin was achieved using 3 M NaOH, and a higher concentration of alkaline aqueous solution led to a reduction of vanillin yield. They proposed that the basicity of the solution was of great importance for the solubility of lignin as well as for conformational behaviour of the particles influencing the accessibility of potential degradation sites towards the electrode surface.31 On the other hand, pH also affects electrode performance. If the solution is more alkaline, the electrode may be corroded or dissolved. Cai et al. characterized the electrochemical performance of Pb/PbO2 electrodes by CV. The electrode oxidation potential of Pb/PbO2 in 1 M NaOH aqueous solution is higher than other concentrations, indicating strong oxidation ability. However, when the NaOH concentration is more than 1 M, the oxide layer on the surface of the Pb/PbO2 electrode will be destroyed.28 Similarly, Liu et al. also observed that an increase in the OH− concentration would promote the dissolution of Cu oxides on the electrode.48
Because of its aromatic ring structure, lignin is easily soluble in organic solvents. Therefore, organic solvents can be used as reaction medium for the electrochemical depolymerization of lignin. For example, Ma et al. investigated the impact of organic solvent systems such as MeOH, MeCN, DMSO, and THF on the electrooxidation degradation of model compounds and lignin. The best solubility was obtained when MeCN was used as the solvent, and the dimer was degraded to benzaldehyde and phenol with the highest yield.69 However, the solubility of lignin from the same lignocellulosic biomass varies greatly depending on the isolation methods. Ideally, a suitable solvent should be carefully selected to dissolve lignin easily. However, the fractionation method of biomass may also significantly affect the dissolution behavior of lignin in the electrolyte. Lignosulfonates have broad pH water solubility and are the first technical lignin feedstock available in industry for the production of value-added products.70 By far the most abundant industrial lignin is kraft lignin obtained from the pulp and paper industry, which is water insoluble but soluble in alkaline aqueous solutions.71,72 Organic solvent-extracted lignin is usually soluble in a variety of organic solvents. Lignin has structural anisotropy properties and its dissolution is facilitated in high pH solutions (introducing charges to polymer chains), moderately polar solvents such as alcohols and ethylene glycol, and highly asymmetric electrolytes such as ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents.73–77 Furthermore, the solvent will not only affect the highest concentration that the substrate can reach but also change the parameters during electrolysis, such as conductivity, mass transfer effect, etc., which in turn affects the depolymerization effect.
Although an organic solvent has good solubility for the depolymerization product, it has the problem of low conductivity in the electrolysis system. Researchers have found a strategy to use deep eutectic solvent (DES) with good conductivity and organic solvent to form a combined solvent system. Di Marino et al. proposed a system combining in situ extraction and electrochemical depolymerization as shown in Fig. 3. A stable emulsion system can be formed by dissolving kraft lignin in a deep eutectic solvent together with MIBK as the extraction phase. In electro-oxidation of lignin in emulsions using nickel or graphite electrodes, the depolymerized products were rapidly in situ extracted into the organic phase to avoid over-oxidation. However, the researchers only revealed the depolymerization effect through the measurement of molecular weight and did not qualitatively and quantitatively degrade the monomers.78

Ionic liquids (ILs) are liquid at room temperature and consist entirely of anions and cations. They are an emerging solvent with good solubility and high solubility for lignin. In addition, they exhibit good thermal and chemical stability and electrical conductivity. ILs are hardly volatile and have a wide electrochemical window, which is crucial for the electrochemical degradation of lignin at higher voltages. Therefore, these advantages have intrigued researchers. The properties of ionic liquids can be tuned by altering the combination of anions and cations. Reichert et al. reported a new method for the electrocatalytic oxidation of lignin using proton ionic liquid triethylammonium methanesulfonate as a solvent and Ru0.25V0.05Ti0.7Ox with significant catalytic activity as an anode. In this process, the key step to the oxidation process was the single-electron transfer (SET) induced by transition metals such as vanadium. Since vanadium could act as a single-electron oxidant, the single-electron reaction V(V) → V(IV) could easily occur. Moreover, the proton transport properties of the proton ionic liquid could facilitate the elimination of protons required for the subsequent oxidation step, which in turn promoted the further formation of vanillin from lignin oxidation intermediates. The total product yield was up to 6%, but the authors did not further quantify each oxidation product.79 Rauber et al. used [Et3NH][MeSO3] as both solvent for dissolving lignin and supporting electrolyte. Based on the binary metal oxide RuxIryOz, ternary electrodes were made by doping Mn, Pd, V, and Ti transition metals. Without electrode passivation or ionic liquid degradation, both the electrode material and the ionic liquid could have good stability up to 1.8 V (vs. Ag). The system effectively depolymerizes lignin into small aromatic molecules, and the distribution and yield of degradation products are highly dependent on the electrode materials.51 When Ru0.2Mn0.2Ir0.6Ox was used as the electrode, the yield of degradation products was as high as 11.5%, but the authors did not provide the absolute yield of each aromatic compound. Due to the hydrophilicity of ionic liquids, the separation and regeneration of ionic liquids can be achieved by simple water extraction. The use of ionic liquids overcomes some of the disadvantages of electrochemical depolymerization of lignin in aqueous medium, including the poor water solubility of lignin, narrow electrochemical window of water, and the need for a large amount of supporting electrolytes. However, although the use of ionic liquids can improve the lignin degradation efficiency, it undoubtedly increases the cost, which limits its large-scale applications.62
2.3 Auxiliary additives
Lignin may not be directly adsorbed on the electrode surface for reaction due to its macromolecular structure. To improve the lignin degradation effect, researchers have found that addition of some redox mediators, oxidants, and catalysts to the electrolysis system can improve the efficiency well. Smith et al. added nitrobenzene, and 1,3-dinitrobenzene as oxidants to a single-compartment electrolytic cell. Nitroaromatics may be adsorbed at the anode and interact with phenolic substrates to facilitate electron transfer. The oxidative regeneration of nitrobenzene by electrocatalysis at 170 °C avoids or reduces the formation of reduced nitrogen-containing by-products and further improves the monomer yield.80 However, the authors only reported the relative yields. Furthermore, due to the considerable toxicity of nitrobenzene and its reduction products, the feasibility of this degradation method is debatable.
Ma et al. reported an efficient electrocatalytic strategy to degrade lignin and model compounds at room temperature. They used platinum foil as anode and cathode, tert-butyl hydroperoxides (t-BuOOH, 70% aqueous solution) as an oxidant to generate peroxide radicals, and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide as a phase transfer catalyst. The system could efficiently cleave the Cα–Cβ bond of the dimer model compound, and the yields of benzaldehyde and phenol were as high as 67% and 27%. Mechanistic studies revealed that t-BuOOH decomposed to generate a tert-butyl peroxy radical intermediate, which oxidized the lignin model compound to Cβ radical. Then the intermediate with Cβ radical and the tert-butyl peroxy radical intermediate generated peroxide intermediate through radical/radical cross-coupling, followed by electron transfer in the transition state, inducing the Cα–Cβ bond cleavage to form aromatic aldehydes, phenols, and CO2. However, the authors only analyzed the linkage information of lignin by 2D HSQC NMR spectra, but did not provide the specific composition of the degradation products.69
Zhang et al. used a three-phase three-dimensional electro-Fenton reaction for the first time to convert lignin to long-chain fatty acids. They added Fe2+ to the system, and the inflated O2 was reduced on the electrode to form H2O2, forming an electro-Fenton system. Lignin undergoes degradation, ring-opening, and dicarboxylic acid coupling reactions to generate free radicals, ultimately synthesizing precursors for biodiesel or advanced biofuels. Under the optimal conditions, the highest yields of palmitic acid and octadecanoic acid reached 138.41 and 112.31 mg g−1, respectively.39 Buftia et al. utilized the Fenton reaction of electro-reduction to generate hydrogen peroxide in situ with an iron catalyst to generate hydroxyl radicals with strong oxidizing properties. It could effectively degrade Eucalyptus globulus kraft lignin black liquor to achieve maximum mineralization and COD removal.81
2.4 Separation of degradation products
The composition of the mixture after electrolysis of lignin is very complicated, and the electrolyte contains a large amount of unreacted or chemically modified lignin, cracked oligomers, aromatic monomers, short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids, etc. To recover the value-added aromatic monomers, the conventional procedure in the laboratory is to acidify the mixture to precipitate lignin. The slurry is then filtered to obtain lignin cake and aqueous solution. Finally, organic solvent is added to the aqueous phase layer for liquid–liquid extraction to extract the low molecular weight aromatic mixture therein. The organic solvent is then evaporated to obtain the product. However, there are some drawbacks to this process for its application on a larger scale. First, the two operating units of acid neutralization and extraction will use a large amount of acid and organic solvent and generate a lot of waste liquid, which is unfavorable to the environment. Second, filtration and distillation are time-consuming and energy intensive, and the equipment usually requires frequent maintenance. Third, the process yields a depolymerized mixture, which is difficult to use directly without further separation. Therefore, this method cannot be scaled up to an industrial scale due to its high cost and considerable emissions.
To realize the green and sustainable development of the product separation process, Schmitt proposed a novel and feasible post-treatment concept for the direct adsorption of electrolytes with strongly basic anion exchange resins to selectively enrich vanillin and other phenolic compounds, as shown in Fig. 4. Larger lignin particles do not attach to gel-type resins due to size exclusion effects. Only a small amount of acid is required to desorb value-added products from the resin, which has significant advantages over traditional methods.53 Furthermore, the group used a strongly basic anion exchange resin for the adsorption of phenolic chemicals in papermaking black liquor, and then electrolyzed the lignin black liquor after phenolic compounds were removed to produce vanillin with high selectivity. Under optimized conditions, vanillin can be enriched to 0.34 mg ml−1.53

As shown in Fig. 5, Stiefel et al. combined electrochemical depolymerization and membrane filtration for controlled depolymerization of lignin. They investigated the impact of the structural form of nickel-based electrode materials (flat plate/wire material/fleece/foam) on mass transport, electrochemically active area, and depolymerization efficiency. To avoid the over-oxidation of the products to organic acids and CO2, the authors used a nanofiltration membrane device, allowing small molecular products like aromatic aldehydes to be isolated in time while the residual lignin was cycled for electrochemical degradation. However, the authors quantified some products (vanillin, acetovanillone, syringaldehyde) and found that the individual yields did not exceed 0.5%.45 Furthermore, the research group designed an electrochemical membrane reactor (ECMR) to integrate electrochemical depolymerization of lignin and product/lignin separation into one device. Because of the positive pressure on the anode side, lignin depolymerization occurs within the tubular ceramic membrane, resulting in low molecular weight degradation products that pass through the nanofiltration membrane, while high molecular weight lignin remains in the feed stream, allowing for in situ product separation.67

Separation of the desired monomers from the lignin depolymerization product mixture is crucial to facilitate its upgrading in industrial applications. Compared with lignin depolymerization, the separation of depolymerization products has not received enough attention. Current research efforts are focused on individual operating units, including extraction, membrane filtration, chromatographic separation, crystallization, and distillation, most of which remain at the small-scale laboratory experiment or pilot-plant stage.82–84 The oxidative depolymerization of lignin produces complex mixtures of various phenolic compounds, which makes its industrial application difficult. On the one hand, these phenolic compounds have similar chemical and physical properties (such as molecular weight, acid dissociation constant, density, and melting point). On the other hand, value-added products (such as vanillin and syringaldehyde) are present in very low concentrations in these mixtures. Therefore, the purification of monomers is quite challenging.83 In addition, each operating unit has its limitations, such as the possible solvent contamination of extractive separations and the high cost of chromatographic separations.84 Current research on the separation of lignin degradation products is more inclined to some combination techniques, which can strike a balance between product selectivity and operating cost. However, most of the research only explores concepts or theories. Several researchers have proposed optimal separation sequences for the enrichment of vanillin or syringaldehyde fractions.83 It seems that separation of the electro-oxidation products of lignin is a challenging topic. New separation technologies and devices are expected to be developed. Moreover, direct use of the mixture of degradation products without further purification may also be a promising way to reduce the product separation cost.
2.5 Mechanisms of electro-oxidative depolymerization of lignin
There are currently few investigations on the reaction mechanisms of lignin electro-oxidative depolymerization. Two mechanisms are generally recognized. The first mechanism is the direct electron transfer on the surface of the anode electrocatalysts, and the metal or metal oxide electrocatalysts are involved in the oxidation of lignin. The second mechanism involves the depolymerization of lignin by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated near the anode, which is partially generated by electrolysis of aqueous or partially aqueous solvents.59,62,85 Researchers have confirmed that lignin may be degraded and its molecular weight reduced in an anhydrous deep eutectic solvent environment.44 This suggests that lignin can be depolymerized in the absence of reactive oxygen species, proving the rationale of the first mechanism. Moreover, both mechanisms can be involved in the electro-oxidation of lignin.
The linking bonds between the constituent units of lignin are mainly C–C (5-5, β-5, β-β, β-1) bonds and C–O–C (4-O-5, α-O-4, β-O-4) bonds. If aromatic compounds are the target products, it is preferred that C–C bonds and C–O–C bonds between the structural units can be cleaved selectively without side reactions such as the aromatic ring opening and mineralization. Because the content of C–O bonds in lignin is much higher than that of C–C bonds, cleavage of C–O bonds is a critical step in the production of aromatic chemicals.86 Most depolymerization strategies are focused on the cleavage of β-O-4 bonds, since this is the most abundant linkage in lignin, typically accounting for 50% of all linkages.
For the degradation mechanism of lignin model compounds, researchers usually use dimers containing β-O-4 bonds as the model compounds.27,69,87,88 Chen et al. employed CV, in situ FT-IR, GC-MS and DFT calculation to investigate the degradation mechanism of 2-phenoxy-1-phenethanol, 2-phenoxyacetophenone and 2-phenoxy-1-phenylethane model dimers.89 As shown in Fig. 6, they found that the HOMOs of three model dimers are delocalized over aryl rings and the β-O-4 bond. The first step is the single-electron transfer oxidation, forming a dimeric phenyl radical cation intermediate. Then β-O-4 bond (Cβ–O) cleavage and Cα–Cβ cleavage take place due to electron delocalization. For 2-phenoxy-1-phenethanol, Cβ–O cleavage leads to the formation of phenylacetaldehyde, phenol and hydroquinone. Besides, Cα–Cβ cleavage leads to the formation of benzaldehyde and benzoic acid. It is worth noting that Cα–OH remains unchanged during electrochemical oxidation but not oxidized to CαO. Furthermore, the presence of Cα–OH in the dimer is the key to the formation of aldehyde-containing products, otherwise alcohol-containing products would be formed. Therefore, retention of some specific functional groups in lignin will alter the distribution of depolymerized products to selectively yield desired products.

Recently, Zhou et al. reported the role of methoxy and Cα–OH in the bond cleavage selectivity of β-O-4 lignin model compounds. These mechanisms depend on methoxy substituent positions and Cα-group substituent types but are not closely related to the number of methoxy groups. The presence of the methoxy group on the benzene ring can reduce the dissociation energy of the β-O-4 bond.90 Although the introduction of ortho-methoxy on the aryl ring adjacent to the β-O-4 bond does not affect the bond-breaking mechanisms of dimers, it would improve the conversion efficiency of dimers. In this case, the substitution of Cα affects the oxidation products’ distribution. When the second methoxy is inserted into the aryl ring close to the Cα–Cβ bond, the impact of the Cα-based substituent becomes more obvious. Under the combined effect of C–OH and para-methoxy, the oxidation mechanism of the dimer is more selective for the cleavage of the Cα–Cβ bond.91
C–C bonds generally have higher dissociation energy than C–O bonds in lignin, which makes the selective cleavage of C–C bonds a challenge for lignin degradation. For C–C bond cleavage, Cui et al. performed electrocatalytic depolymerization of 2-phenoxy-1-phenylethanol using atomically dispersed Pt–N3C1 sites planted on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (Pt1/N-CNTs) as the catalyst. As shown in Scheme 5, 99% substrate conversion and 81% benzaldehyde yield can be obtained. Therefore, this process can cleave Cα–Cβ of β-O-4 model compounds with high activity and selectivity. Subsequently, the authors further revealed the reaction mechanism through radical trapping, isotopic labeling, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.92
 Scheme 5  Catalytic conversion of 2-phenoxy-1-phenylethanol.92 
The reaction rate of cleavage of β-O-4 bond at the anode can be accelerated by the addition of additives such as oxidants. Cui et al. performed bulk electrolysis of a model compound at the anode with tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP, 70% aq. soln) as the oxidant with H2 generation at the cathode under ambient conditions. A possible mechanism for the electrocatalytic conversion of the lignin model molecules is proposed as shown in Fig. 7. The authors hypothesized that there may be two reaction pathways involving tert-butoxy (tBuO˙) and tert-butylperoxy (tBuOO˙). DFT calculations revealed that the Gibbs reaction energies and energy barriers of the tBuO˙ pathway were lower. Therefore, compared with the tBuOO˙ pathway, the tBuO˙ pathway was more prone to occur. The whole process started with the activation of tBuOOH/1a, accompanied by the formation of tert-butoxyl radical (tBuO˙) A1. Subsequently, Cβ–H of 2-phenoxy-1-phenylethanol was extracted to form Cβ radical B˙ on the surface of the Pt1/N-CNTs anode. Then, tBuO˙/tBuOO˙ reacted with unstable Cβ radical B˙ to generate intermediate C through radical/radical cross-coupling reaction. Finally, the electron transfer of C itself led to the cleavage of the Cα–Cβ bond to generate aromatic aldehydes, phenols and CO2. Notably, this process did not form Cα ketone or Cα radical intermediates, which, although capable of lowering the bond dissociation energy (BDE) of Cβ–O, increased the BDE of Cα–Cβ. In turn, the Cα–Cβ bond was kept intact and the β-O-4 bond was broken. However, in this study, the Pt1/N-CNTs electrocatalyst promoted forming Cβ radical intermediate, which could couple with tBuO˙ to induce Cα–Cβ bond cleavage. Therefore, this catalyst was significantly different from previously reported catalysts, and it was highly selective for Cα–Cβ bond cleavage.92

Ma et al. proposed a similar bond-breaking mechanism using a mimic electrolysis system as shown in Scheme 6. First, t-BuOOH decomposed to generate the tert-butyl peroxy radical intermediate. Subsequently, the lignin model compound (1a in Fig. 7a) was oxidized to Cβ radical A by Cβ–H extraction on the Pt anode. The tert-butyl peroxy radical intermediate was then reacted with the active Cβ radical A to generate the peroxide intermediate B through radical/radical cross-coupling. After that, electron transfer occurs in transition state B, resulting in the cleavage of Cα–Cβ. Finally, aromatic aldehyde, phenol and CO2 were formed.69

Most of the lignin model compounds studied are non-phenolic, while phenolic compounds are rarely used due to the complexity of the reaction. Liu et al. explored the electrochemical degradation process of phenolic lignin model compounds (4-ethoxyphenol (EP), 4-phenoxyphenol (PP), p-benzyloxyphenol (PBP), and 2-(2-phenylethoxy) phenol (2-PEP)) in a proton ionic liquid–water system ([BSO3Hmim][OTf]–H2O) as shown in Scheme 7. Through the combination of degradation product analysis and isotope labeling experiments, the C–O bond cleavage mechanism was proposed, mainly involving direct oxidation and indirect oxidation. Specifically, PBP firstly dissociated a proton to form phenoxy anions (PBP−), and then donated an electron on the anode to generate phenoxy radicals (PBP1˙). Then, PBP1˙ could be converted to PBP2˙ through quinone resonance, leading to the activation of 2-C or 4-C atoms. O(PBP2˙) of the ether bond might have basic properties and easily combine with protons to generate oxonium ions. Under N2 atmosphere, the PBP intermediate could be directly oxidized on the RuO2–IrO2/Ti mesh electrode, and the Caryl–O bond was broken to form quinone and carbonium ions. The carbonium ions were attacked by H2O to produce benzyl alcohol via route B. Subsequently, benzyl alcohol could be further oxidized to benzaldehyde by oxidative dehydrogenation. Under O2 atmosphere, PBP2˙ might react with ROS generated during ORR, resulting in indirect cleavage of the ether bond in PBP2˙ (pathway A). Meanwhile, direct oxidation of direct PBP also occurred (pathway B).93

For lignin, the oxidation process usually involves the cleavage of aromatic rings, aliphatic side chains or other bonds.94 Since the oxidative depolymerization of lignin is widely studied to produce vanillin, lignin to vanillin conversion is taken as an example here to illustrate the degradation mechanism. According to the study of Tarabanko et al., the oxidative degradation mechanism of lignin involved two-electron loss processes, as shown in Scheme 8. First, proton dissociation occurred in alkaline medium to form phenoxy anions. The Cα–Cβ bond between phenylpropane units was then dehydrated, followed by electron abstraction from the phenoxy anion to form a phenoxy radical. The phenoxy radical lost an electron once more to generate quinone methide, and then nucleophilic addition of OH− to the intermediate quinone methide and oxidation took place to form a cinnamaldehyde-like intermediate. Finally, the retro-aldol reaction occurred to generate the vanillin monomer.94–99

Specifically, β-O-4 bonds have bond energy between 68.2 and 71.8 kcal mol−1.42 Through DFT calculations it was found that substituent effects can have a significant impact on the BDE of the β-O-4 bond. For example, oxidation of the α-hydroxyl to ketones can reduce the BDE by 15 kcal mol−1.100,101 As a result, it promotes bond cleavage, increasing the yield of depolymerized products. Many researchers have conducted lots of exploratory studies on the pre-oxidation of hydroxyl groups based on this principle. Bosque et al. studied the degradation of β-O-4 bonds by a one-pot two-step oxidation process. They used N-hydroxyphthalimide and 2,6-lutidine (NHPI/lutidine) as mediators for the electrocatalytic oxidation of α-OH in dimer model compounds with high selectivity to ketones, which then formed aromatic monomers by photocatalytic cleavage of C–C bonds. However, when the substrate was extended to lignin, only 1.3% and 1.14% of the two aromatic ketones were detected.33 Rafiee et al. employed 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidine N-oxyl (TEMPO) and 4-acetamido-TEMPO (ACT) as catalytic mediators. Under mild conditions, the γ-OH in poplar lignin was electro-oxidized to carboxylic acid, which enhanced its water solubility. The electrochemically pre-oxidized carboxylated lignin was further depolymerized with formic acid to obtain 29% aromatic products, including 7.8% syringaldehyde and 0.8% vanillin.102
Meanwhile, the oxidative degradation of lignin will produce phenolic acids including vanillic acid and syringic acid. For the formation of phenolic acids, researchers have hypothesized different reaction pathways. Some studies assumed that phenolic acids were directly formed by the Cα–Cβ cleavage of phenylpropane units.82 They found that the production of vanillin and vanillic acid from lignin oxidation were distinct pathways, as parallel behaviors were observed in the formation and degradation of aromatic aldehydes and corresponding acids in the experiments. Therefore, vanillic acid was not an oxidation product of vanillin.94 However, other researchers pointed out that the major route to generate vanillic acid is by the oxidation of vanillin,103 which involves a consecutive reaction mechanism. In addition, acetovanillone and acetosyringone are by-products of the oxidation process. The researchers suggested that when OH− attacked the α position of quinone methide, an acetyl derivative would be formed, and when it attacked the γ position, it would lead to the formation of aromatic aldehydes.82,97 Furthermore, the oxidative depolymerization of lignin also produces a small number of by-products such as guaiacol.
In addition, the electro-oxidative degradation of lignin can be reflected by the other structural characteristic changes, including bond contents, functional groups and molecular weights. For example, Cai et al. compared the FT-IR spectra of the raw lignin and the degraded solid residue. They found reduced hydroxyl content in both aliphatic and aromatic structures. The elemental analysis demonstrated that the O/C ratio of lignin residues increased, while the H/C ratio decreased after degradation, indicating the oxidation of –OH groups. The reduced peak intensity of methyl or methylene in the spectrum indicated the presence of methyl products during electrocatalytic degradation. The peak intensity of the carbonyl group was greatly increased, which confirmed the occurrence of the oxidation reaction.28 Breiner et al. used two-dimensional heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy (2D HSQC) NMR to further study the structural changes of lignin during electrolysis. The signal corresponding to the β-aryl ether unit decreased significantly after electrolysis. Furthermore, peaks related to phenylcoumaran and resinol linkages and Hibert's ketone structures completely disappeared. It suggested that these bonds were oxidized and partially cleaved during electrochemical depolymerization. By comparing the spectra of lignin before and after electrolysis, it was observed that the signals of syringyl and guaiacyl structures were significantly reduced. In addition, the signals corresponding to ferulate (Fa), p-coumarate (Pcs), stilbene (St) and tricin (T) units disappeared completely. Furthermore, 31P NMR measurements showed a significant decrease in aliphatic hydroxyl groups, while the number of carboxylic acid functional groups increased by three fold.30 Yan et al. used gel permeation chromatography (GPC) to determine the molecular weight of native sweetgum ethanol organosolv lignin and oxidation products in the aqueous phase. The results showed that the number-averaged (Mn) and weight-averaged (Mw) molecular weights of the lignin were 3123 and 5163 g mol−1, respectively. After electrolysis, the Mn and Mw of the oxidized lignin samples in the aqueous phase decreased to 2650 and 4435 g mol−1, respectively, confirming the effectiveness of electrocatalytic oxidative depolymerization of lignin macromolecule.50 However, even though the catalytic system is very effective for degradation of model compounds, the durability of the system becomes much poorer when applied to real lignin feedstock. Therefore, the reaction mechanisms proposed for depolymerization of lignin model compounds are generally not fully applicable to the conversion of lignin macromolecules. The molecular complexity of biomass remains an issue worthy of deeper research.
3. Challenges and opportunities
Electrocatalytic depolymerization of lignin is a very promising field. Although corresponding research started at the beginning of the last century, this field has previously been underappreciated by scholars. With the growing importance of energy and environmental issues, biomass such as lignin has attracted more and more attention. From simple electrolytic treatment of lignin wastewater to value-added products such as aromatic compounds, research on electrolytic polymerization of lignin is becoming increasingly sophisticated and in-depth. However, due to the complexity of lignin, some important scientific issues in this field still need to be addressed.
3.1 Structural features of raw lignin feedstock for electrolytic conversion
To date, various isolated lignins have been used as feedstock in electrolytic systems for the production of value-added products. In general, the yield of aromatic monomers from natural lignin is higher than that of industrial lignin. Some studies have suggested that higher β-O-4 bond content is beneficial for obtaining higher yield of depolymerized monomers,104 such as vanillin.105 Various methods have been employed to isolate lignin, including a range of physical, chemical, and biological processes, but these isolation process undoubtedly result in significant chemical structural changes in natural lignin.7,106 As a result, significant cleavage of β-O-4 bond and serious condensation between lignin monomeric units are caused with formation of more stubborn structures, which makes the subsequent depolymerization of lignin difficult. However, the content of β-O-4 linkages of isolated lignin is also significantly related to the characteristics of the lignocellulose feedstock. Hardwood lignin (50–65%) has a higher β-O-4 linkages content than softwood lignin (43–50%) because of the higher proportion of S-type units in hardwood, which eliminates the 5-5 or β-5 free radical coupling.107 Additionally, recalcitrant C–C bond-rich (5-5, β-β, β-5, β-1) lignin with higher bond dissociation energy values is more likely to appear during the biosynthesis of G-unit softwood.108 Therefore, it is difficult to predict the products obtained by electro-oxidation of different lignin feedstocks. However, it is generally believed that the catalytic depolymerization of hardwood lignin has higher yields of aromatic monomers than softwood. Thus, to achieve relatively high yields of the desired products, it is necessary to use isolated lignin rich in β-O-4 linkages with less degree of condensation for electrolytic conversion. It indicates that to avoid condensation reactions, the isolation process of lignin from lignocellulosic biomass should be performed under mild conditions, which will lead to the formation of more stable structures.
The key step to the depolymerization of lignin for value-added products such as phenols is the effective cleavage of the linkages between units, in which the bond energy of aryl ether linkages (i.e. β-O-4 linkages) is lower than that of C–C bonds. At present, there are many strategies to catalytically cleave β-O-4 linkages of lignin model compounds by chemical methods. Modification of the adjacent group is a classic strategy. By pre-converting the adjacent chemical groups of the target C–C and C–O bonds in lignin, the bond dissociation energy of target chemical bonds can be reduced or substrate sites are generated in the substrate molecule, which further promotes the efficient cleavage of target chemical bonds.109 In this regard, many researchers have made various studies.102,110–113 However, there are relatively few studies on this strategy using electrochemical methods. Further electrochemical oxidative depolymerization of lignin by pretreatment of lignin, for example chemical or electro-oxidation of side-chain functional groups, deserves further investigation. Therefore, pretreatment or pre-oxidation of lignin to obtain modified feedstock suitable for electro-oxidation may promote the efficiency of electrolytic depolymerization of lignin for the production of value-added products.
3.2 Electrocatalysts and catalytic systems
Compared with chemical methods, electrochemical oxidative depolymerization of lignin has a lower yield of aromatics. Development of electrocatalysts and catalytic systems with higher catalytic activity is thus of great importance. The highly selective cleavage of C–C bonds and C–O bonds between building blocks is crucial for lignin depolymerization. Numerous catalytic and non-catalytic strategies have been reported for the cleavage of C–O and C–C bonds, but this is only effective for lignin model compounds.114 Therefore, it is necessary to design new catalytic methods to achieve efficient depolymerization of lignin. Furthermore, because lignin depolymerization usually involves free radical reactions, intermediates can be condensed through free radical coupling, resulting in biphenyl structures.7,25 Suppressing the side reactions of the depolymerization process is also important.
The trade-off effect of lignin conversion rate and product selectivity must be handled for scaling up the process. The lignin conversion rate is increased when the voltage and current are both high, but there are problems with over-oxidation and product selectivity, and vice versa. Furthermore, during the electrochemical depolymerization process, lignin and intermediates will be adsorbed to the electrode surface, causing contamination after a period of operation.59 As a result, developing electrocatalysts for lignin oxidation with high activity, stability and low cost is critical.
3.3 Separation methods
Although electrochemical conversion is a green and sustainable approach for lignin depolymerization, most current research has ignored the issue of downstream processing.24 The obtained product is a mixture of aromatic products and fatty acids, which is very complicated in composition and difficult to separate effectively.7 Currently, most of the separation methods only enrich a certain type of product, but cannot achieve the refined separation of the product, making it difficult to achieve further downstream utilization.
3.4 Development of characterization techniques
In recent years, lignin characterization technologies have been developed significantly, which provides great help in understanding the structure of lignin more in depth. Some modern instrumentation methods are widely used. For example, coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) enables chemical imaging of lignin. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) spectral imaging can provide lignin chemical distribution maps. Using advanced one- and two-dimensional (2D) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) can accomplish a structural analysis of interunit linkages of lignin. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis can provide information on small molecule products of lignin depolymerization.7 However, the lignin degradation process is quite complicated, and many products are still unidentified. It is expected that new analytical methods will be developed and extend the degradation product database. Only by accurately analyzing the whole depolymerization process can the degradation mechanism be elucidated, and the development of more efficient electrolytic system can then be better guided.
4. Conclusion and perspective
The electrochemical depolymerization of lignin is an emerging research field and is currently at a thriving research stage. Electrochemical methods enable green and sustainable lignin valorization under mild conditions. This review has provided a comprehensive overview of the research progress of the electrochemical oxidation of lignin to produce value-added chemicals, including various depolymerization strategies to convert lignin to aromatic chemicals. The effects of electrode materials, solvent systems, and auxiliary additives on lignin depolymerization have been discussed. In conclusion, the electro-oxidative depolymerization of lignin is a promising method, but there are still some difficulties and challenges. It is necessary to further optimize and intensify the process to increase the yield of the target products and improve the economic feasibility for achieving large-scale application.
First, more efficient electrodes and catalysts for lignin depolymerization to monomeric products with higher selectivity should be developed. A more in-depth examination of the role of electrocatalysts in the degradation of lignin or model compounds could facilitate the development of electrodes and catalysts. It is critical to investigate the key factors influencing the selectivity of depolymerized products, in order to achieve controllable production of target products.
Second, the structure of the electrolytic cell has an impact on the product yield. The design of the electrolytic unit can be combined with other modules, such as membrane filtration units.45,67 Considering that the repolymerization of lignin intermediates and the over-oxidation of the products will occur during the depolymerization process, a separation module can be added to the design of the electrolysis device to separate the products simultaneously, thereby increasing the product yield. Integrating electrocatalytic depolymerization and separation processes has the advantage of reducing the complexity of the process while also mitigating product loss and reducing energy consumption in the separation process, hence enhancing the economic feasibility.
Furthermore, a variety of monomer compounds can be obtained through the oxidative degradation of lignin, and the separation of target products is an important part of lignin valorization. The high-yield depolymerization of lignin into a single platform chemical is nearly impossible due to the complicated structure of lignin and complex reactions taking place in the electro-oxidative depolymerization. For the depolymerized mixture, conventional methods such as crystallization and solvent extraction have been developed. However, the main disadvantage of these methods is the requirement of a large amount of organic solvent. Therefore, non-solvent-based separation processes, such as adsorption and membrane separations, become attractive alternatives for the separation of lignin-derived phenolic compounds.82,83,115 However, the isolation and purification of the products is a very difficult task because phenolic compounds have very similar chemical and physical properties. As a result, a single separation approach may not be sufficient, and a combination of multiple separation methods may be necessary to get the final high-purity product desired.
Last but not least, the ultimate challenge in lignin electro-oxidation valorization is to achieve the goal of industrial scale-up. Because the category of depolymerization products is highly dependent on process parameters, the electrocatalytic oxidation conversion of lignin to produce high-value-added compounds has some flexibility. Specifically, the process parameters relate to the electrocatalytic system design (electrode materials, catalysts, cell types, electrolyte solvents) and reaction conditions (current density, voltage, temperature, concentration, etc.). After the initial success of the laboratory test, that is, after the technical feasibility evaluation is completed, the process parameters should be adjusted according to the market demand and economic potential to evaluate the economic feasibility. The global market is rapidly changing, and the products to be manufactured are determined based on market demand.116–118 To maximize the expected product yield, different technical routes and process parameter optimization should be focused on, to maximize the derived value of lignin. Many proof-of-concept experiments on the electro-oxidative depolymerization of lignin have been conducted, and encouraging progress has been made. However, process integration is needed for industrial application.

Reaction time	Short (0–2 hours)	Long (0–30 hours)
Source of oxidants	Additional oxygen or other oxidants	Free radicals or other oxidizing species generated on the anode in situ
Side reactions	Over-oxidation of products and high temperature leads to massive coke formation, which in turn clogs the reactor and deactivates the catalyst	Hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reaction and the products can be over-oxidized, but hydrogen can be used for fuel cells
Control of reaction rate and product selectivity	Controlling temperature and pressure	Controlling current density and voltage
Energy type and consumption	Thermal energy and the process is relatively energy intensive	Electric energy, and the source of electricity can be combined with renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, etc.
Yield of products	Relatively high product yields	Relatively low product yields
Recovery of catalyst	Catalyst recovery is relatively complicated	Electrodes can be easily removed from the reaction medium
