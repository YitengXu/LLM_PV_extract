    , Accepted 21st August 2017First published on 23rd August 2017AbstractPhotosystem II (PSII), as the only enzyme to catalyze the light-induced water oxidation reaction in the natural photosynthesis system, is introduced to fabricate artificial solar conversion systems with an intensive photo-to-current efficiency to convert solar energy into electrical power. In this research, we report a hybrid photo-bioelectrochemical system consisting of PSII isolated from spinach leaves that is co-assembled in nanotubular indium–tin oxide (ITO) multilayer films pasted on the commercial ITO substrate as a photoanode, which presents enhanced photocurrent responses as high as 2.4 μA cm−2 (mediator-free) and 39 μA cm−2 (with mediator) under white light irradiation (λ < 800 nm) using a xenon lamp as the light source. In this photoanode system, the three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical porous nanotubular ITO film was synthesized through a layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly process using a natural cellulose substance (e.g., filter paper) as a template. The specific structure, and good optical and electrical properties of the hierarchical nanotubular ITO allow for an increased protein loading as high as 166 pmol PSII cm−2 and an enhanced photocurrent by about 78 times compared with the bare PSII photoanode. This biomimetic template fabrication method of ITO materials with unique morphologies and desirable properties provides an effective assembly strategy for PSII-based hybrid photoanode systems for solar energy conversion.
Introduction
Solar light as an inexhaustible renewable energy inspires human beings to convert it into chemical energy or electrical power that can be utilized. Photosynthesis is the largest-scale sustainable effective energy conversion system in nature that converts solar energy into chemical energy,1,2 which gives an inspiration for the fabrication of artificial solar conversion systems simulating this natural process to meet human needs for energy.3 In the photosynthetic chain, photosystem II (PSII) that is found in the thylakoid membrane of higher plants, algae and cyanobacteria, is the core enzyme complex for light harvesting, charge separation, and the extraction of electrons through water oxidation.4–7 The electron separation process that happens in the PSII contains several steps. Electrons transfer to the plastoquinones (QA and QB as the electron acceptor sites of PSII) under the photoexcitation of PSII, and then the positive holes generated in PSII oxidize the Mn4CaO5 complex that catalyzes the oxygen evolution while regenerating the PSII center.7,8 In recent years, artificial solar conversion systems, such as photoelectrochemical and solar cells inspired by the natural photosynthetic system,9–13 have been paid great attention to convert solar energy into electrical power in a renewable way. Among these artificial solar conversion systems, hybrid photo-bioelectrochemical cells based on native photosynthetically active bioentities or enzymes are of great interest, because the biomimetic strategy for the building of artificial solar conversion systems is quite important to sufficiently understand the complex photosynthetic processes and for the further design of advanced artificial solar conversion systems.14–21 Therefore, PSII serves as a promising enzyme when introduced into photo-bioelectrochemical cells.
In the proposed photo-bioelectrochemical cell systems based on PSII, the integration of the PSII protein with the electrode and the electron transfer wiring between the protein and the electrode are essential.22–24 A high protein loading and a good electric contact facilitate more photo-induced electrons being transferred from the electron acceptor sites of PSII to the electrode, and further generate photocurrents effectively. Hence, a number of studies have been undertaken on electrode surface modifications for the immobilization of more PSII onto the electrode. Indium–tin oxide (ITO)-based materials have been adopted as one of the most widely used materials in the applications of optoelectronics, such as solar cells or photoelectrochemical cells,25,26 due to their superior performances in terms of optical transparency in the visible region and electrical conductivity.27 Assemblies of photosystem I (PSI) and/or PSII on ITO electrodes using two different redox polymers (poly-benzyl viologen, PBV2+, and poly-lysine benzoquinone, PBQ) as glues were constructed using a LBL deposition process, and this PBV2+/PSI/PBQ/PSII photoelectrochemical system led to a significant enhanced photocurrent of 1.2 μA cm−2.28 Erwin Reisner and co-workers reported several photoanode systems for solar water splitting and photocurrent generation through PSII assembly on a mesoporous ITO electrode or a self-assembled monolayer (SAM)-functionalized mesoporous ITO electrode, in which photocurrent responses of 22 μA cm−2 and 4.5 μA cm−2 were achieved, respectively.29,30 Furthermore, Reisner et al. established a photoanode that assembled the PSII on the hierarchically-structured inverse opal (IO) ITO electrode, and remarkably high DET of 20 μA cm−2 and MET of 960 μA cm−2 photocurrents were recorded.31 To improve the electrical wiring between the PSII and the electrode, the Os complex-modified polymer was co-adsorbed with PSII on this hierarchical IO-ITO electrode, and a highly enhanced DET photocurrent of 410 μA cm−2 was obtained.32 However, the complicated modification procedures restrict the original ITO substrate, and the relatively flat hydrophobic surface puts a limitation on the effective protein loading. Moreover, surface modified noble metal electrodes, such as Au and Pt, were used for PSII integration.33–39 It was reported that PSII was oriented and immobilized on the Au surface modified with a SAM of a nickel–nitrilotriacetic acid complex via a His-tag as the linker molecule, showing a maximum photocurrent response of 13.5 μA cm−2.33 In addition, redox polymers that acted as both the immobilization matrix and the electron acceptor were also prepared on the Au surface for PSII loading, and about 300 nA cm−2 was observed for the poly(mercapto-p-benzoquinone)/PSII anode system.36 However, a high protein loading is still hardly obtained due to the low surface area of the noble metal electrodes.
The facile strategy of the LBL self-assembly using bio-friendly natural substances as templates has been widely used in the preparation of nanomaterials.40 Through this approach, the specific properties of the guest species and the unique hierarchical structures of the bio-templates are well-combined. Among the diverse bio-templates, natural cellulose substances (e.g., laboratory filter paper) are considered to be an ideal choice because of the well-defined micro- to nanostructures and the high surface area. In the previous work, various kinds of materials with hierarchical nanotubular or nanofibrous structures were prepared via the LBL self-assembly method using cellulosic filter paper as the bio-template.41,42 In our recent study on the hybrid photo-bioelectrochemical system, nanotubular titania materials templated from laboratory filter paper were prepared to modify the ITO electrode, followed by PSII immobilization to construct a hybrid PSII/TiO2 photoanode system to convert solar energy into electrical power, and a photocurrent response as high as 10.6 μA cm−2 was generated.43 However, quite a bit of the photocurrent was attributed to TiO2 under white light irradiation, indicating that the enhanced photoelectrochemical performance of this PSII/TiO2 photoanode system depended largely on the TiO2.
Herein, in order to reduce the background photocurrent of the material used to modify the electrode, we constructed a hybrid photo-bioelectrochemical system with PSII isolated from spinach leaves co-assembled in a nanotubular ITO multilayer film-modified electrode. The 3D hierarchical porous nanotubular ITO film was prepared through a LBL self-assembly process using a natural cellulose substance (e.g., filter paper) as a template, and then was pasted on the commercial ITO substrate by Au paste to fabricate the modified electrode. The bio-inspired ITO film possesses a relatively higher specific surface area, high transmittance in the visible region and the desired good electrical conductivity, which are expected to facilitate the PSII loading and electron transfer in this constructed hybrid photo-bioelectrochemical electrode. This assembly strategy of a hybrid photo-bioelectrochemical system provides an effective architecture for a synthetic solar energy conversion system with a relatively higher photon-to-current conversion efficiency.
Results and discussion
Structure of the nanotubular ITO films
As shown in Fig. 1, ITO thin gel layers were deposited to coat each cellulose nanofiber of the filter paper by the LBL self-assembly processes with different layer numbers n (n = 5, 10, 15) to obtain the ITO gel layer/filter paper composite sheet (Fig. 1a), which was further subjected to calcination treatment in air to give the 3D hierarchical nanotubular ITO [(ITO)n-NT] films (Fig. 1b). The detailed fabrication process of the (ITO)n-NTs is presented in the ESI.† The DTA/TG curves of the as-deposited ITO gel layer/filter paper composite are shown in Fig. S1.† The first region of weight loss in the TG curve lower than 200 °C is attributed to the loss of absorbed water. The second region higher than 200 °C is associated with an obvious exothermic peak at 347 °C in the DTA curve, which is due to the decomposition and removal of the cellulose component from the as-deposited composite. The exothermic peak that occurs at around 423 °C is related to the ITO crystallization.44

(i) HR-TEM micrograph, and (j) SAED pattern of the sample (ITO)10-NTs. 
The XRD pattern of the sample (ITO)10-NTs is presented in Fig. 1c, in which peaks at 21.5, 30.6, 35.5, 45.7, 51.0 and 60.7° ascribed to the (211), (222), (400), (431), (440) and (662) planes of In2O3 with a body-centered cubic bixbyite structure are observed [JCPDS no: 88-0773].31 Any reflection of the crystalline SnO2 as an additional phase is not shown in this pattern, demonstrating that the Sn dopants are incorporated in the crystal lattices and the solid solution of In and Sn is formed at this In/Sn molar ratio.45 The same crystal phase is observed in the XRD patterns of the samples (ITO)5-NTs and (ITO)15-NTs (Fig. S2a, ESI†).
As illustrated in the XPS spectra of the sample (ITO)10-NTs, only indium, tin and oxygen elements are detected in the wide scan spectrum except the C 1s peak at 284.5 eV stemming from carbon containing molecules adsorbed onto the nanoparticle surface, indicating the high purity of the sample (Fig. S3, ESI†). Two peaks centered at 444.1 and 451.6 eV correspond to In 3d5/2 and In 3d3/2, respectively (top spectrum of Fig. 1d). The bottom spectrum of Fig. 1d shows the two binding energies of Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2 concentrated at 486.1 and 494.6 eV, respectively.45 This indicates that In(III) and Sn(IV) exist in the sample. Besides, XPS analyses of the samples (ITO)5-NTs and (ITO)15-NTs show the same results (Fig. S4, ESI†). The molar ratio of In and Sn in the samples (ITO)5-NTs, (ITO)10-NTs and (ITO)15-NTs is about 5.25:1 (Sn% ≈ 16 wt%) by theoretical calculations. According to other research, the electrical conductivity of the ITO materials firstly increases with the introduction of the tin as the electron dopant, and usually reaches the highest value at 5–17 wt% of tin oxide depending on the preparation methods.45–47 Whereas higher concentrations of tin dopants result in the separate growth of low-conductivity tin oxide phases, which have no contribution to the electrical conduction, and further lead to an obvious decrease of the electrical conductivity of the ITO materials.48–50
The FTIR spectra of the prepared nanotubular ITO materials show absorption peaks at 3395, 1651 and 488 cm−1 (Fig. S2b, ESI†). The broad band between 2600 and 3600 cm−1 is assigned to –OH stretching vibrations of the residual water present in the samples.51 The peak at 1651 cm−1 is ascribed to the vibrations of –OH derived from In–OH or Sn–OH, and the peak at 488 cm−1 corresponds to In–O or In–OH stretching,52 confirming the chemical bonds of the ITO.
The UV-vis spectrum of the sample (ITO)10-NTs is displayed in Fig. 1e, and shows a transmittance of approximately 92% at the standard wavelength of 550 nm; similar transmittances are observed in the spectra of the samples (ITO)5-NTs and (ITO)15-NTs (Fig. S2c, ESI†), indicating the synthesized nanotubular ITO materials possess a relatively higher optical transmittance in the visible region.53

Fig. 1f depicts the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm of the sample (ITO)10-NTs. The BET specific surface area of this ITO sample is measured to be 59.5 m2 g−1. Besides, this nanotubular ITO material possesses a wide pore size distribution from several nanometers to hundreds of nanometers with an average micropore size centered at 17 nm, macropore sizes of 200–500 nm, and a pore volume of 0.28 cm3 g−1 (inset of Fig. 1f), which is due to the hierarchical nanotubular structure of the ITO material (Fig. 1g and h). The mesopores in the material are mainly formed by the interspaces between ITO nanoparticles that comprise the nanotube wall (Fig. 1h). Besides, the formation of the macropores in the material is attributed to the ITO nanotubes being interwoven together tightly (Fig. 1g). This specific hierarchical structure provides a relatively higher specific surface area and a rougher surface for a high PSII loading.
SEM images of the (ITO)10-NTs film pasted on the ITO slide indicate that the (ITO)10-NTs film with a hierarchical irregular porous nanotube network was coated on the surface of the ITO substrate entirely and uniformly (Fig. 1g and S5a, ESI†). In detail, the ITO nanotube with outer diameters of a few hundreds of nanometers is composed of nanoparticles with an average size of 6 nm (Fig. 1h and S5b, ESI†). The HR-TEM micrograph of the sample (ITO)10-NTs is depicted in Fig. 1i, and the well-developed crystal lattices with interplanar distances of 0.292 nm, 0.253 nm and 0.226 nm are attributed to the (222), (400) and (420) planes of the In2O3 with a cubic bixbyite structure, respectively. Besides, the clear grain boundaries indicate the high crystallinity of the ITO nanoparticles. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the ITO sample displays typical rings corresponding to the (211), (222), (400), (440) and (622) reflections of the crystalline cubic bixbyite In2O3 (Fig. 1j),45 which is consistent with the result of the XRD pattern. Similar morphologies, particle sizes and crystal phase are observed for the samples (ITO)5-NTs and (ITO)15-NTs in the corresponding electron microscopy images and SAED patterns (Fig. S6 and S7, ESI†). However, the specific nanotubular structure of the sample (ITO)5-NTs is not obvious, compared with the samples (ITO)10-NTs and (ITO)15-NTs, because the ITO gel layer deposited on the surface of each cellulose nanofiber is too thin to replicate the morphology of the template in the sample (ITO)5-NTs.
The specific 3D hierarchical porous nanotubular structure, relatively high specific surface area, high transmittance in the visible region and the desired good electrical conductivity of the synthesized ITO materials are expected to facilitate the PSII loading and electron transfer in the designed photo-bioelectrochemical electrode modified by the (ITO)n-NT films.
Photoelectrochemical performances of the hybrid PSII/(ITO)n/Au photoanodes
A series of photoanodes using the ITO slide as a substrate was fabricated (Fig. 2a–g). Especially, the hybrid PSII-based nanotubular ITO photoanode (PSII/(ITO)n/Au photoanode) with an active area of 0.78 cm2 was assembled (Fig. 2h), and the supposed electron transfer process of this photoanode is shown in Fig. 2i. The electrons are excited from P680+/P680, the lower energy state in PSII (1.19 V vs. NHE), to the excited energy state, P680*/P680+ (−0.62/−0.66 V vs. NHE) under white light irradiation with energy of 1.82 eV.54 Then the positive holes in P680+/P680 are reduced by extracting electrons from water with molecular oxygen generated. The electrons from P680+/P680 are transferred to the porous ITO nanotube network from the QA (−0.14 V vs. NHE) or QB (−0.06 V vs. NHE) terminal electron acceptor sites without 2,5-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone (DCBQ) as an electron transfer mediator, and finally injected into the ITO substrate (0 V vs. NHE)55 through an Au layer, thus realizing the photo-induced electron–hole charge carrier separation and generating a direct electron transfer (DET) photocurrent. When DCBQ with a relatively positive potential of +0.021 V vs. NHE was added, the electrons were transferred to the ITO substrate through the diffusion of the DCBQ, resulting in the mediated electron transfer (MET) photocurrent.

(h) A piece of (ITO)n-NT film was pasted on a commercial ITO slide by Au paste, then the PSII isolated from spinach leaves was co-assembled on the ITO nanotubes to give a hybrid PSII/(ITO)n/Au photoanode. The photograph in (h) shows the corresponding specimen (even the modified area of the photoanode is larger than 0.78 cm2, the active area of the photoanode defined to be the area immersed in the electrolyte is calculated to be 0.78 cm2), and the SEM image in (h) displays the morphology of the nanotubular ITO film-modified electrode. (i) Energy diagram for the cascaded electron transfer processes in the hybrid PSII/(ITO)n/Au photoanode system. 
DET photocurrent responses of the assembled photoanodes were recorded at varied bias potentials from 0 V to +1.00 V vs. SCE under white light irradiation at 25 °C (Fig. 3a and S8, ESI†). Typical photocurrent responses are summarized in Table 1. The DET photocurrents generated by the Au photoanode (Fig. 2a) are observed to be about 0 nA cm−2 at bias potentials from 0 V to +0.50 V (Fig. S8a, ESI†), indicating the Au layer is stable at a bias potential lower than +0.50 V. The photocurrent responses of the fabricated photoanodes firstly increase obviously and then increase slowly with the bias potential until the potential reaches +1.00 V. Additionally, it is clear that the photocurrents of the PSII/(ITO)10/Au photoanode are always much higher than those of the other photoanodes at the same bias potentials (Table 1). Therefore, +0.25 V vs. SCE was chosen as the fixed bias potential. The DET and MET photocurrent responses of the PSII photoanode (Fig. 2c) and PSII/Au photoanode (Fig. 2d) are recorded to be almost the same, and both the DET (1.7 μA cm−2) and MET (27.8 μA cm−2) photocurrents of the PSII/(ITO)10/Au photoanode are observed to be the highest among all the electrodes at a bias potential of +0.25 V vs. SCE (Fig. 3c–e). It is worth noting that the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of the PSII/(ITO)10/Au photoanode is calculated to be ∼0.026% (DET) and ∼0.5% (MET) based on the PSII central absorption wavelength of 680 nm and its corresponding light intensity of 10 mW cm−2, and the values for the PSII photoanode and PSII/Au photoanode are determined to be ∼0.0006% (DET) and ∼0.013% (MET), indicating that modifying the electrode with the synthesized nanotubular ITO film indeed increases the IPCE. Turnover frequency (TOF) values for the O2 evolution of PSII/(ITO)10/Au photoanode are calculated to be 0.03 and 0.5 mol O2 (mol per PSII) per s for DET and MET, respectively, assuming all the PSII assembled on this photoanode is photoactive. In addition, the photocurrent of the hybrid PSII/ITO/Au photoanode is closely related to the thickness of the nanotubular ITO film pasted on the electrode (Fig. S9, ESI†). The PSII/[(ITO)10]2/Au photoanode (Fig. 2f) with two layers of ITO films pasted on the electrode shows a larger photocurrent compared with that of the PSII/(ITO)10/Au photoanode, which might because more PSII could be entrapped into the more abundant pores. However, the photocurrent generated by the PSII/[(ITO)10]3/Au photoanode (Fig. 2g) with three layers of ITO films pasted on the electrode shows an obvious degradation, which might be due to the fact that the thicker layers of ITO films hinder electrons transfer from PSII to the electrode. This reveals that an ITO layer with a proper thickness is essential for the photocurrent generation.

The amounts of PSII immobilized on the photoanodes were characterized based on the absorption intensities of PSII in the UV-vis spectra of each photoanode. In the UV-vis spectra of the PSII immobilized on the PSII, PSII/Au and PSII/(ITO)10/Au photoanodes, the absorption bands at 435, 471 and 678 nm correspond to PSII, showing a good agreement with the previous report (Fig. 3b),56 indicating the successful immobilization of PSII on the electrode. It is worth noting that the relative amount of PSII integrated into the PSII/(ITO)10/Au photoanode is observed to be about twice as much as that integrated into the other two photoanodes according to the absorption intensities of PSII in the UV-vis spectra. The PSII density on the PSII/(ITO)10/Au photoanode is calculated to be approximately 146 pmol PSII per cm2 with 35 chlorophyll a molecules per PSII and a 0.78 cm2 active surface area, which is about 7.7 times as high as the PSII loading density on the classical PSII/mesoITO photoanode system.29 Although the electrical conductivity of the Au photoanode (62.5 S m−1) is as high as two orders of magnitude compared to that of the bare ITO substrate, the hydrophobic and smooth surface of Au still put a limitation on the protein loading and photocurrent generation. By the method of pasting the synthesized ITO film with a 3D hierarchical porous nanotubular structure on the ITO substrate, the hydrophilicity and specific surface area of the electrode are increased, which further enhances the PSII loading and electrical contact between the protein and electrode, leading to significantly enhanced photocurrents and IPCE. Table 2 provides a comparison of the PSII-based photo-bioelectrochemical cell systems using the ITO substrates reported previously.28–32 PSII/PBV2+/PSII/PBV2+ (poly-benzyl viologen, PBV2+) on the ITO substrate is fabricated using a LBL deposition process, which reveals a directional generation of the photocurrent of 500 nA cm−2.28 Besides, PSII assembly on the mesoporous ITO electrode (PSII/mesoITO) reveals a DET photocurrent of 1.6 μA cm−2 and MET photocurrent of 22 μA cm−2.29 Further study reported a photoanode system of PSII immobilized on the SAM-functionalized mesoporous ITO electrode (PSII/C2CO2−/mesoITO) through electrostatic interaction with a DET photocurrent of 0.28 μA cm−2 and MET photocurrent of 1.4 μA cm−2, or through covalent interaction with a DET photocurrent of 0.43 μA cm−2 and MET photocurrent of 4.5 μA cm−2.30 As illustrated in Table 2, the hybrid PSII-based photoanode system constructed by us shows a relatively good photoelectrochemical performance, compared to most of the other PSII photoanode systems in previous studies, except for some recent systems based on PSII isolated from the thermophilic cyanobacterium T. elongatus reported by Erwin Resiner and co-workers.31,32 On the one hand, the (ITO)n-NT films possesses a specific 3D hierarchical porous nanotubular structure derived from natural cellulose, leading to a higher PSII loading and a shorter electron transfer path. And the superior optical and electrical properties of the (ITO)n-NT films give a better electrical contact and an enhanced electron transfer effect between the loaded PSII and the ITO substrate, which promotes the DET photocurrent responses effectively. On the other side, the specific 3D hierarchical porous nanotubular network of the (ITO)n-NT films facilitates the diffusion and access of the electron transfer mediator (e.g., DCBQ), resulting in sharply increased MET photocurrent responses.

The photocurrent stabilities of these PSII-based photoanodes are displayed in Fig. 3f. A half-life time of 20 min is observed for the PSII/(ITO)10/Au photoanode under continuous white light irradiation. It was reported previously that the PSII/mesoITO photoanode and the PSII/C2CO2−/mesoITO (covalent interaction) photoanode show photodegradations with half-life times of <5 min and ∼12 min, respectively.29,30 PSII with a genetically introduced His-tag was attached onto the gold electrode modified with thiolates bearing terminal Ni(II)–nitrilotriacetic acid groups, and a half-life time of 18 min was reported.33 This indicates that the fabricated photoanode system possesses a slightly higher stability. Moreover, the photocurrent response remains about 50% of the initial value for the PSII/(ITO)10/Au photoanode after white light illumination for 80 min, and becomes almost unchanged compared with the PSII/Au photoanode (only 35% left after 80 min irradiation). The higher stability is attributed to the close contact between PSII and the (ITO)n/Au electrode, in which PSII integrates into the porous ITO nanotube networks to avoid protein falling out from the electrode, and reduces damage of the protein caused by the direct light irradiation. In addition, photo-induced electrons from PSII can be transferred to the nanotubular ITO film with a good electrical property quickly, thus also reducing the photo damage of PSII.
It is worth mentioning that the generated DET and MET photocurrents of the PSII/(ITO)n/Au photoanode increase with the LBL self-assembly layers (n) in the preparation processes of the sample (ITO)n-NTs, and the PSII/(ITO)15/Au photoanode shows the highest DET (2.4 μA cm−2) and MET (39 μA cm−2) photocurrents (Fig. 4). This suggests that the photoelectrochemical performance of the assembled hybrid photoanode system is closely related to the morphology of the nanotubular ITO film used to modify the electrode. Among all the synthesized nanotubular ITO films, the sample (ITO)15-NTs possesses a more typical hierarchical porous nanotubular morphology from the macroscopic to the microscopic scale replicated from cellulose substance. Each ITO microtube composed of a number of nanotubes provides a rougher surface with more deposition cycles in the LBL self-assembly process, which facilitates PSII loading and shortens the electron transfer path more effectively, hence achieving a higher photocurrent response. It is shown that the PSII density on the PSII/(ITO)15/Au photoanode is calculated to be about 166 pmol PSII per cm2, which is the highest among the PSII amounts on the three hybrid PSII/ITO/Au photoanodes (Fig. 5a). Furthermore, the PSII/(ITO)15/Au photoanode possesses the best photocurrent stability with a photocurrent response of about 57% of the initial value remaining under continuous white light irradiation for 80 min, compared with 45% and 50% for the PSII/(ITO)5/Au photoanode and PSII/(ITO)10/Au photoanode, respectively (Fig. 5b). This good stability benefits from the more precise hierarchical porous nanotubular morphology of the sample (ITO)15-NTs and the closer contact between the protein and the (ITO)15/Au electrode. The TOFs for DET and MET with the PSII/(ITO)15/Au photoanode are determined to be 0.04 and 0.61 mol O2 (mol per PSII) per s, respectively. Compared with the TOFs of PSII/(ITO)10/Au photoanode, the higher TOF values suggest that a better photoelectrochemical performance is achieved with the PSII/(ITO)15/Au photoanode. As shown in Fig. S10,† the photocurrent action spectra of the PSII/ITO/Au photoanodes with a maximum value at 680 nm match the recorded UV-vis spectra of the assembled PSII very well, confirming the integration of PSII in its native state on the photoanodes. Besides, more accurate IPCE values measured by the action spectra are slightly lower than the calculated IPCE values in Table 2. Moreover, the enhanced photocurrent response is high enough to drive lighting by LEDs with the assistance of a bias potential of +1.7 V vs. SCE. The LEDs were almost dark without illumination of the PSII/(ITO)15/Au photoanode, and the current was measured to be only 1.2 μA. While the current increased to 4.3 μA after 600 s white light illumination, and the LEDs were lit obviously by the photocurrent generated by the PSII/(ITO)15/Au photoanode (Fig. 4d), suggesting a good photoelectrochemical performance of the photoanode system.

Experimental
Fabrication of the hybrid photoanodes
The purchased ITO substrates were cut into small rectangular pieces (0.6 × 2.5 cm2), ultrasonicated in ethanol and deionized water for 20 min successively, to clean up the slides, and then dried with a stream of N2.
The PSII solution with a chlorophyll concentration of 1.0 mg Chl per mL and an oxygen evolution activity of ∼213 μmol O2 (mg per Chl) per h (see ESI†) was obtained by diluting the PSII stock solution from fresh spinach leaves with 20 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethane sulfonic acid (MES) buffer (pH 6.5). All the fabrication processes were carried out in the dark to avoid light damage to the PSII. The nanotubular ITO film synthesized by using cellulose filter paper as a template (see ESI†) was pasted on the commercial ITO slide by Au paste, denoted as the (ITO)n/Au photoanode (Fig. 2b). Besides, the Au paste coated ITO slide without pasting the nanotubular ITO film on it was prepared for comparison, denoted as the Au photoanode shown in Fig. 2a. 10 μL of the diluted PSII solution was dripped onto the bare ITO slide, Au photoanode and (ITO)n/Au photoanode and left at 4 °C in the dark for 1 h. Then, the electrodes were washed with 20 mM MES buffer solution to remove the excessive absorbed PSII followed by drying with a stream of N2. The resultant electrodes are denoted as the PSII photoanode and PSII/Au photoanode and PSII/(ITO)n/Au photoanode (Fig. 2c–e), respectively. Moreover, another one or another two nanotubular ITO films were pasted on the surface of the (ITO)10/Au photoanode. Then, 10 μL of the diluted PSII solution was dripped onto these two photoanodes, which were denoted as PSII/[(ITO)10]2/Au photoanode (Fig. 2f) and PSII/[(ITO)10]3/Au photoanode (Fig. 2g), respectively. The fabricated photoanodes were used as working electrodes in the subsequent photoelectrochemical measurements.
Characterization
Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images were acquired on a Hitachi S4800 instrument working at an acceleration voltage of 15.0 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) observations were performed on a FEI Tecnai G2 20 S-TWIN microscope operating at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a Netzsch STA 409 PC/PG instrument at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from 25 °C to 450 °C in air. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were conducted on an Empyrean diffractometer with a CuKα (λ = 0.15405 nm) radiation source in the range 15–70°. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out using an Escalab 250XI spectrophotometer, and all binding energies were referenced to the C 1s peak at 284.50 eV. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a Tensor-27 FTIR spectrometer in the transmittance mode with a standard KBr technique applied. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm were obtained with a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 analyzer, and the specific surface area was calculated by using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) model. The pore volume and pore size distribution were determined by means of the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method by using the adsorption branches of the sorption isotherms. UV-vis spectra were measured on a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrophotometer in the transmission mode for solution samples employing pure water as the reference standard; and in the diffuse reflectance mode for solid samples using an integrating sphere accessory with pure barium sulfate (BaSO4) as the background in the range 250–800 nm. The relative amounts of PSII immobilized on the PSII, PSII/Au and PSII/(ITO)n/Au photoanodes were characterized based on the absorption intensities of PSII in the UV-vis spectra of the corresponding photoanode through the following method. PSII immobilized directly on the ITO slide was dissolved in 200 μL of H2O. Besides, the PSII/(ITO)n/Au or PSII/Au layer on the ITO slide was scraped off, suspended in H2O (200 μL) and then centrifuged to remove the Au and ITO particles. The supernatant was analyzed by UV-vis spectrophotometry.
Photoelectrochemical evaluations
Photoelectrochemical measurements of the fabricated photoanodes were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660D, Shanghai, China). The fabricated photoanodes, a platinum wire and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode in each photoelectrochemical measurement, respectively. A buffer solution (pH 6.5) that contained 20.0 mM MES, 50.0 mM KCl, 5.0 mM MgCl2 and 3.0 mM CaCl2 was used as the electrolyte for the photocurrent measurements of direct electron transfer (DET) and the stability test. Each photoanode, Pt electrode and SCE were immersed in 30 mL of electrolyte vertically, and the level of the electrolyte was estimated to be 1.3 cm in the electrochemical cell (5 × 5 × 5 cm3). Hence, the effective area of the working electrode was 0.78 cm2 (0.6 × 1.3 cm2). A home-built piece of equipment, including a xenon lamp (P = 150 W) with a filter (λ < 800 nm) and a condenser between the electrochemical cell and the xenon lamp, was used to obtain a white light irradiation that simulated sunlight. The power density of the light at 680 nm was measured to be 10 mW cm−2 by the optical power meter. DET tests were recorded at a series of bias potentials of 0.00 V, +0.25 V, +0.50 V, +0.75 V and +1.00 V vs. SCE. Moreover, 1 mM 2,5-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone (DCBQ) was added into the electrolyte as an electron transfer mediator to characterize the mediated electron transfer (MET) photoelectrochemical performances of the assembled photoanodes.
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) of the PSII/(ITO)n/Au photoanodes were defined as follows: (1)where h, c, e and λ indicate Planck's constant, the vacuum velocity of light, the charge of an electron and the wavelength of the incident light (680 nm), respectively. The generated photocurrent density (j) and the power density of the incident photon flux at a wavelength of 680 nm (P) were recorded in the corresponding photoelectrochemical measurement. It was supposed that all the incident photons were absorbed by the photoanodes.
The photocurrent action spectra of the PSII/(ITO)10/Au photoanode and the PSII/(ITO)15/Au photoanode were recorded using a series of band pass filters with a half-width of 10 nm, and the light intensity at the corresponding central wavelength was controlled to be 0.35 mW cm−2. 1 mM DCBQ was added into the electrolyte as an electron transfer mediator to enhance the photocurrent signal.
To test the photo-bioelectrochemical performances of the assembled hybrid PSII-based photoanodes, LEDs were parallel connected between the working electrode and the electrochemical workstation. The assembled PSII/(ITO)15/Au photoanode was used as the working electrode. A bias potential of +1.7 V vs. SCE was applied using the electrochemical workstation. 1 mM DCBQ was added to the electrolyte buffer solution as an electron transfer mediator to achieve the MET photocurrent, and an 800 nm filter was inserted in the light path for white light irradiation that simulated the sunlight.
Conclusions
In conclusion, a hybrid photo-bioelectrochemical system (PSII/(ITO)n/Au photoanode) was fabricated by co-assembling PSII isolated from spinach leaves in a nanotubular ITO multilayer film-modified electrode for solar energy conversion and electrical power generation. It was found that the assembled PSII/(ITO)n/Au photoanodes demonstrated promising photoelectrochemical performances. Enhanced photocurrent responses as high as 2.4 μA cm−2 (DET) and 39 μA cm−2 (MET) were recorded under white light irradiation that simulated sunlight, which were high enough to assist in lighting LEDs. The enhanced photoelectrochemical performance is attributed to the modification of the electrode with the (ITO)n-NT films possessing a specific 3D hierarchical porous nanotubular structure derived from natural cellulose, leading to a higher PSII loading, a shorter electron transfer path, and a better diffusion and access of the electron transfer mediator. Besides, the superior optical and electrical properties of the (ITO)n-NT films also promote the photocurrent responses. The hierarchical nanotubular ITO multilayer films used to modify the electrode in our report are fabricated separately and then pasted on the electrode through electrical Au paste, and such an approach is convenient and facile in the photoanode construction. It shows that our work provides an effective strategy for the design and fabrication of an artificial biomimetic solar energy conversion system with a highly enhanced photon-to-current conversion efficiency, which is expected to have potential applications in a wide range of areas.

 	Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the synthesis process of the nanotubular ITO film and its characterizations. (a) ITO thin gel layers were deposited to coat each cellulose nanofiber of the filter paper followed by calcination of the as-deposited ITO gel layer/filter paper composite sheet in air to give the nanotubular ITO [(ITO)n-NT] films. (b) The photographs show the corresponding specimens. (c) XRD pattern, (d) XPS spectra: In 3d spectrum (top) and Sn 3d spectrum (bottom), (e) UV-vis spectrum, and (f) nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm of the sample (ITO)10-NTs; inset of (f) is the pore size distribution curve obtained from the adsorption branch of the isotherm. (g) FE-SEM image of the sample (ITO)10-NTs pasted on the ITO slide; inset shows a typical nanotubular structure of the (ITO)10-NTs film, and (h) TEM image of an individual ITO nanotube; inset shows that the average size of ITO nanoparticle is about 6 nm. (i) HR-TEM micrograph, and (j) SAED pattern of the sample (ITO)10-NTs.	 

 	Fig. 2  Schematic illustration of a series of photoanodes fabricated in this work and the working mechanism of the PSII/(ITO)n/Au photoanode. (a–g) A series of photoanodes fabricated in this work. (h) A piece of (ITO)n-NT film was pasted on a commercial ITO slide by Au paste, then the PSII isolated from spinach leaves was co-assembled on the ITO nanotubes to give a hybrid PSII/(ITO)n/Au photoanode. The photograph in (h) shows the corresponding specimen (even the modified area of the photoanode is larger than 0.78 cm2, the active area of the photoanode defined to be the area immersed in the electrolyte is calculated to be 0.78 cm2), and the SEM image in (h) displays the morphology of the nanotubular ITO film-modified electrode. (i) Energy diagram for the cascaded electron transfer processes in the hybrid PSII/(ITO)n/Au photoanode system.	 

 	Fig. 3  Photoelectrochemical performance of the PSII/(ITO)10/Au photoanode. (a) DET photocurrent responses of the PSII/(ITO)10/Au photoanode to the repetitive illumination of white light and darkness cycles. A series of bias potentials of 0.00, +0.25, +0.50, +0.75 and +1.00 V vs. SCE was applied. (b) UV-vis spectra of PSII loaded on the PSII, PSII/Au and PSII/(ITO)10/Au photoanodes; the PSII immobilized on each photoanode was scraped off and dissolved in deionized water for the UV-vis spectral characterization. (c) DET and (d) MET photocurrent responses of the Au, PSII, PSII/Au, (ITO)10/Au and PSII/(ITO)10/Au photoanodes to the repetitive illumination of white light and darkness cycles. (e) Histograms of the photocurrent responses of the modified ITO electrodes; inset shows the enlarged histogram of the DET photocurrent responses. (f) Photocurrent stabilities of the PSII, PSII/Au and PSII/(ITO)10/Au photoanodes under continuous white light irradiation. A bias potential of +0.25 V vs. SCE was applied at 25 °C for all the cases.
