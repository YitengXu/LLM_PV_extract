    , Accepted 23rd October 2018First published on 23rd October 2018AbstractHybrid organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been attracting great attention. A conjugated organic molecule, bathocuproine (BCP), is often deposited on C60 for electron collection in inverted PSCs. But organic molecules are not stable against UV light and cannot act as good barrier layers to protect the perovskite layer. In principle, inorganic materials can have better stability, but the thermal deposition of inorganic materials usually requires very high temperature. In this work, zinc selenide (ZnSe), a two-dimensional (2D) II–VI semiconductor material with a wide bandgap and high electron mobility, is investigated for electron collection in PSCs without BCP. The ZnSe layer is deposited by using a normal thermal evaporator. The PSCs with ZnSe can exhibit a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.38%, comparable to that with BCP. In addition, the former has better stability than the latter. We also demonstrate PSCs with inorganic materials for both hole and electron collection.
1. Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great attention because of their high photovoltaic efficiency and low fabrication cost. The photovoltaic efficiency of single-junction PSCs has been improved to more than 22% since the first report by Miyasaka et al. a few years ago.1–3 The high photovoltaic performance of PSCs is related to the extraordinary optoelectronic properties of perovskites, such as appropriate and tunable bandgaps,4,5 low charge recombination rate,6 and long carrier diffusion length.7 Nevertheless, stability is a big hurdle for their commercialization. Light, heat, moisture and oxygen can cause the degradation of perovskite materials.8,9 The stability depends upon not only the perovskite materials but also the charge collection materials between the perovskite layer and electrodes.
There are mainly two types of device architectures, normal and inverted. For the PSCs with normal architecture, a mesoporous oxide layer deposited on a transparent electrode is used for electron collection, and an organic layer like spiro-OMeTAD is usually coated on the perovskite layer for hole collection. Recently, Yang et al. prepared a layer of ZnSe on mesoporous TiO2 through the chemical reaction of ZnSe precursors in solution. They found that the ZnSe layer can lower the interfacial charge recombination and thus improve the photovoltaic efficiency.10 For the PSCs with inverted structure, poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA),11 poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)12 and NiOx (ref. 13) are popular materials for hole collection, and C60 and its derivatives14–16 deposited by coating or thermal evaporation on the perovskite layer are used for electron collection. Various organic/polymeric materials have been investigated as interfacial materials for PSCs.17 Generally, inorganic materials for charge carrier collection can have better stability against heat, light and moisture than organic materials. They are also better barrier materials to protect the perovskite materials. Thus, inorganic materials particularly oxides have been extensively studied for charge collection in PSCs. Oxides can be prepared on a transparent conductive substrate by thermal deposition at high temperature due to their high melting point or solution processing. The photovoltaic performance of PSCs depends on the thickness and morphology of the oxide layer. High crystallinity is needed for efficient charge collection by the oxide layer. A high temperature annealing process is usually needed to have high crystallinity for solution-processed oxides. For instance, TiO2,18 TiS2,19 ZnO,20 SnO2 (ref. 21) and BaSnO3 (ref. 22) can be used for electron collection, whereas CuOx,21b CuSCN,1c,23 and NiOx (ref. 13) can be exploited for hole collection. The difficulty in fabricating PSCs with inorganic materials for both hole and electron collection lies in the deposition of a uniform inorganic layer on the perovskite layer because of the poor thermal stability and solvent sensitivity of perovskites. Although sol–gel processing of inorganic nanoparticle solutions or sputtering has been reported to deposit inorganic materials on the perovskite layer, it is difficult to obtain a uniform oxide layer with controlled thickness by the sol–gel process, while the temperature during sputtering is too high for perovskites.24 This is also a big problem for the fabrication of monolithic tandem PSCs which requires both electron and hole collection layers between two perovskite layers.25
In this work, zinc selenide (ZnSe), a two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor material, is deposited by thermal evaporation as the interfacial layer between C60 and Ag of inverted PSCs for the first time. Bathocuproine (BCP) is a popular interfacial material between C60 and Ag because it can give rise to ohmic contact and thus improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE).21b,26 But BCP is a conjugated organic molecule and has limited stability. ZnSe is used to replace BCP in order to improve the stability of PSCs. ZnSe is a II–VI semiconductor with high transparency in the visible range due to its wide band gap of 2.8–2.9 eV and has a high electron mobility of 530 cm2 V−1 s−1.27 Although ZnSe has a melting point of 1525 °C, it can be deposited by using a normal thermal evaporator.28 The PSCs with ZnSe replacing BCP can exhibit a PCE of 18.38% and good stability. We also demonstrated efficient and stable PSCs with inorganic materials for both electron and hole collection.
2. Results and discussion
The device architecture of PSCs and the energy levels of the materials are shown in Fig. 1. The conduction band bottom of ZnSe is −4.09 eV. It matches well with the lowest unoccupied molecular level (LUMO, −4.1 eV) of C60, and it is higher than the Fermi level of Ag by about 0.2 eV. In addition, the top of the valence band of ZnSe is lower than the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of C60. Thus, ZnSe can be a good interfacial material for electron collection from the perovskite layer to the Ag electrode.

The ZnSe layer was thermally deposited between the C60 layer and Ag electrode. As shown in Fig. S1 of ESI,† ZnSe has high transmittance in the range from 400 to 1100 nm. The ZnSe layer does not remarkably affect the absorption of ITO/PTAA/perovskite/C60. The J–V curves of a PSC, ITO/PTAA/FA0.9MA0.1PbI2.7Br0.3/C60/ZnSe/Ag, together with control devices with BCP or without the interfacial layer are shown in Fig. 2. The photovoltaic performances of these devices are summarized in Table 1. An interfacial layer between the C60 layer and Ag can improve the PCE of PSCs. The control device without the interfacial layer, ITO/PTAA/FA0.9MA0.1PbI2.7Br0.3/C60/Ag, exhibits a PCE of only 14.99%. The presence of a 3 nm-thick ZnSe layer can improve the PCE to 18.38%. All three parameters, Jsc, Voc and FF, are increased by the ZnSe interlayer. But the PCE improvement can be mainly attributed to the increase of Jsc from 21.00 to 22.18 mA cm−2 and the increase of FF from 0.67 to 0.75. The ZnSe layer lowers the series resistance Rs while increasing the shunt resistance Rsh. The hysteresis is negligible between forward and reverse scans. The photovoltaic performance of the PSCs with ZnSe is comparable with that with BCP.

The photovoltaic performance of the PSCs is sensitive to the thickness of the ZnSe layer (Fig. 3). To understand the effect of the ZnSe layer, various parameters i.e. series resistance Rs, shunt resistance Rsh, diode ideality factor and dark saturation current density J0, and the J–V curves of the devices were analyzed with the single diode model,29 where Rs is the series resistance, A is the diode ideality factor and J0 is the dark saturation current density. The values of the parameters are presented in Table 1. In terms of the PCE values of the PSCs, the optimal ZnSe thickness is 3 nm. The best performing devices have the lowest series resistance and the highest shunt resistance, so that they have high FF, Voc, and Jsc while a lower J0 indicates the low recombination rate of charge carriers inside the perovskite layer. When the ZnSe layer is thinner than 3 nm, the FF value is low. Probably, the ZnSe layer does not fully cover the C60 layer. This is confirmed by the low shunt resistance. When the ZnSe layer is thicker than 3 nm, the FF value decreases. This is consistent with the increase in the series resistance. This can be ascribed to the resistance of the ZnSe layer.

Various characterization methods were carried out for understanding the effect of ZnSe as an electron transport layer. External quantum efficiency (EQE) and integrated photoelectron current density for the best performing device with ZnSe as the ETL were calculated in terms of the EQE data (Fig. 4). Jsc calculated from EQE data is 22.6 mA cm−2, which is consistent with the Jsc calculated from the J–V curves presented in Fig. 2(a).

The surface morphologies of the perovskite, perovskite/C60 and perovskite/C60/ZnSe were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 5). The ZnSe layer has no remarkable effect on the surface morphology and roughness of perovskite/C60. This suggests that ZnSe may uniformly cover the underlying C60 layer. No aggregation of ZnSe on C60 was observed. The presence of the ZnSe layer is confirmed by the SEM mapping and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS). As shown in Fig. S2 and S3 of the ESI,† both Zn and Se signals can be observed for ZnSe thermally deposited on glass, perovskite or Ag. The XPS results also indicate the 1:1 molar ratio of Zn to Se. The SEM mapping results suggest the uniform coverage of perovskite/C60 with ZnSe.

To check the effect of ZnSe on the optoelectronic process of the perovskite, time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was performed (Fig. 6). The data were analyzed by using the biexponential decay function, , where A1 and A2 are fraction constants, and τ1 and τ2 are the lifetimes of the fast and slow decay of charge carriers, respectively. Generally, the fast decay is attributed to photo-excited charge carrier trapping by the defects or photo-excited charge carrier transport to the charge extraction interlayers, and the slow decay depends upon the radiative decay process.31 The values of A1, A2, τ1 and τ2 are listed in Table 2. The presence of the C60 layer significantly lowers the τ2 value from 654.9 ns to 120.6 ns. It further decreases to 92.6 ns in the presence of the ZnSe layer. The enhanced quenching is also verified by PL data (Fig. S1 of ESI†), which indicates the efficient extraction of charge carriers in the presence of the ZnSe layer.30a This is consistent with the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs.

Diffusion length (LD) and electron/hole mobility were calculated in terms of the relationships ,  and .31b The diffusion length of the sample with C60 alone is 769.94 nm, and it is extended up to 873.14 nm in the presence of a ZnSe layer. This confirms the better extraction of electrons.
Moreover, we fabricated PSCs, ITO/NiOx/FA0.9MA0.1PbI2.7Br0.3/C60/ZnSe/Ag, with inorganic materials for both the electron and hole collection interlayers. NiOx is used for hole collection and C60/ZnSe is used for electron collection. The J–V curves of the best device are shown in Fig. 7. The device exhibits a Jsc of 21.57 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.75, a Voc of 0.96 V, and thus a PCE of 15.55%. On comparison with the PSCs with PTAA, both the Jsc and Voc of the PSCs with NiOx are lower. The lower Voc values of PSCs with NiOx were reported by other labs as well.32 The possible reason for the lower Voc is related to the mismatching of the valence band (−4.89 eV) with that (−5.6 eV) of FA0.9MA0.1PbI2.7Br0.3.22 This is verified by the time resolved PL results of FA0.9MA0.1PbI2.7Br0.3 on NiOx and PTAA (Fig. S3 and Table S1 of ESI†). The excitons of FA0.9MA0.1PbI2.7Br0.3 on NiOx have a longer life time while the hole mobility and hole diffusion length are less than those on PTAA.

The photovoltaic stability of the PSCs was investigated in two ways, for a short-term intrinsic stability and light soaking effect, steady state efficiency is measured by finding and setting the maximum power voltage under continuous illumination for the encapsulated devices. Efficiency data were recorded for 100 s and are shown in Fig. 8. It is obvious from the results that the devices are quite stable under continuous illumination. For determining the long-term photovoltaic stability, the devices without encapsulation were tested every 10 min under the conditions of continuous light illumination and a humidity level of >80% (Fig. 9). The devices were under open circuit conditions between the consecutive measurements. The PSCs with ZnSe exhibit much better stability than the ones with BCP. The stability of the device with both PTAA and BCP degrades remarkably only after light exposure for 30 min. In contrast, the devices with NiOx and ZnSe or PTAA and ZnSe exhibit high photovoltaic performance even after illumination for 120 min. The improvement in the stability can be attributed to the stable nature of the inorganic materials against humidity and light particularly UV light.

The devices were tested under continuous AM1.5 illumination under ambient conditions. 
3. Conclusions
ZnSe, a 2D semiconductor, can be used to replace BCP as an interlayer between C60 and Ag for efficient electron extraction in inverted PSCs. Different from other inorganic semiconductors like oxides, ZnSe can be deposited by using a normal thermal evaporator. The optimal PCE of the inverted PSC, ITO/PTAA/FA0.9MA0.1PbI2.7Br0.3/C60/ZnSe/Ag, is 18.38% with the ZnSe layer of 3 nm thickness. The PCE is comparable to that of the control PSCs with BCP, while it is significantly higher than that without the interlayer between C60 and Ag. The PSCs with ZnSe exhibit better stability than the control devices with BCP. PSCs with NiOx for hole collection and ZnSe for electron collection were demonstrated as well. This work provides an effective way for the development of stable PSCs.
4. Experimental section
Materials
Indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 15 Ω □−1 were provided by the NSG group. Formamidium iodide (FAI) and methylammonium bromide (MABr) were purchased from Dyesol Ltd. Poly(triarylamine) (PTAA, 99.999% purity) was received from Xi'an Polymers. Other chemicals, including lead(II) bromide (PbBr2, 99.999% purity), lead(II) iodide (PbI2 beads, 99.999% purity), zinc selenide (ZnSe, 99.99%), C60 (98% purity), nickel acetate (99% purity), monoethanolamine (MEA) (≥99.5% purity), chlorobenzene (anhydrous, 99.8% purity), toluene (anhydrous, 99.5% purity), dimethylformamide (DMF, ≥99% purity), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, anhydrous, ≥99.9% purity), isopropyl alcohol (IPA, anhydrous 99.5% purity) and silver (Ag beads, ≥99.99% purity) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All the chemicals and materials were used as received without further purification.
Fabrication and testing of PSCs
The devices with the architecture shown in Fig. 1 were fabricated by the following process. ITO glass substrates were cleaned by sonication successively in detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol. The sonication time was 15 min for each cleaning step. They were dried under N2 flow and then transferred into a glove box filled with N2 to coat the PTAA and perovskite layers. The PTAA layer was deposited by spin coating 2 mg ml−1 PTAA in toluene at 6000 rpm for 20 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. The perovskite precursor solutions consisted of 0.9 M PbI2, 0.9 M FAI, 0.1 M PbBr2 and 0.1 M MABr in DMF/DMSO (4:1 vol. ratio). The perovskite layer was coated by dripping 75 μL perovskite precursor solution and spin coating at 2000 rpm for 10 s and then at 6000 rpm for 20 s. 150 μL of chlorobenzene was dripped at 5 s to the end of the spin coating process. The films were then annealed at 100 °C in a DMSO environment for 20 min. The perovskite films were around 300 nm thick. The devices were completed by sequential thermal deposition of C60 (45 nm thick), ZnSe and Ag (100 nm thick) in a vacuum of ∼1 × 10−6 torr using a thermal evaporator. The thickness of the films was read using a quartz crystal microbalance thickness monitor. The parameters of the thickness monitor were calibrated for each material by depositing thick films on glass and the thicknesses of the thick films were determined by using a surface profiler. The devices were encapsulated with UV-curable epoxy and glass sheets in a glove box before photovoltaic testing. The active area of each device was 0.11 cm2.
Devices with NiOx as the hole transport layer were fabricated through a similar procedure. The NiOx layer was deposited on ITO by spin coating its precursor solution at 3500 rpm for 40 s followed by annealing at 300 °C for 45 min. The NiOx precursor solution was prepared by dissolving nickel acetate and monoethanolamine (MEA) (0.15 mol L−1) in anhydrous IPA and stirring at 60 °C for 4 hours which yielded a clear green solution. The Ni to MEA molar ratio was 1:1 in solution.
The devices were tested under ambient conditions. The current density (J)–voltage (V) curves were recorded with a Keithley 2400 source meter. A Newport's Oriel class A solar simulator, which was calibrated with a standard Si photodiode detector, was used to simulate AM1.5 sunlight (100 mW cm−2).
Characterization of the materials
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected with a Bruker D8 Advance XRD instrument. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were acquired with a Veeco NanoScope IV Multi-Mode AFM in tapping mode and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images including SEM mapping were acquired with a Zeiss Supra-40 SEM. The absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-1800 spectrophotometer and a Horiba Scientific Raman system, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were collected using an Axis Ultra DLD X-ray photoelectron spectrometer equipped with an Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV). The lifetime of the excitons was measured by time-resolved photoluminescence with a pulse laser of 438 nm wavelength, 100 kHz frequency and 200 fs duration. The scattered excitation light was eliminated with a 532 nm long pass filter. The emission of the samples was collected using an avalanche photon diode (Micro photon devices by PicoQuant). The PL kinetics were measured using a time-correlated single photon counting module (TCSPC PicoHarp 300 by PicoQuant).
