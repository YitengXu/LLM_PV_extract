    , Accepted 22nd October 2012First published on 30th October 2012AbstractAntimony sulfide has recently demonstrated huge potential as an absorber material in solid-state semiconductor-sensitised solar cells (SSSCs). Here, we present a transient absorption spectroscopy study of the TiO2/Sb2S3/spiro-OMeTAD heterojunctions to elucidate the key factors influencing charge photogeneration. Efficient device performance requires that photoresponse extends into the near-infrared, yet we find that the efficiency of charge separation at the TiO2/Sb2S3 interface decreases significantly as increasingly red-absorbing Sb2S3 nanocrystals are photoexcited. However, the efficiency of hole transfer to spiro-OMeTAD appears much less sensitive to shifts in the Sb2S3 absorption edge and we also observe hole transfer to spiro-OMeTAD occurring on ZrO2 substrates, where electron injection does not occur. These observations may point to the importance of the hole transfer reaction not simply as a means of regenerating the sensitiser, but rather as an integral part of the charge separation process in Sb2S3 SSSCs. The present findings should help inform strategies aimed at further increasing the efficiency of nanocrystal sensitized solar cells.

Broader context
TiO2/Sb2S3-based solar cells have shown great promise as low cost, solution processable photovoltaics and currently lead the semiconductor sensitised solar cell (SSSC) class in terms of power-conversion efficiency. At the operational heart of such devices are a series of interfacial electron transfer reactions that act to separate photogenerated charges. For efficient device performance, the rates and yields of these reactions must be optimised, whilst limiting the effect of competing charge recombination processes. For analogous dye sensitised solar cells (DSSCs), the factors affecting the delicate balance between charge separation and recombination have been studied extensively, yet a comprehensive understanding of the SSSC, particularly that based on Sb2S3, remains limited. It is expected that detailed structure–function relationships for such systems will help establish the design rules necessary for further improvements in efficiency. In this work, we use transient absorption spectroscopy to probe interfacial electron and hole transfer in TiO2/Sb2S3/spiro-OMeTAD systems. Our observations indicate that hole transfer may be able to initiate device function; a phenomenon that should lead to improvements in device performance and the development of novel hybrid inorganic – organic semiconductor solar cell architectures.

Nanocrystalline inorganic sensitisers have emerged as potentially attractive alternatives to the molecular dyes traditionally used to light sensitise mesoporous metal oxides in solid-state dye-sensitised solar cell (DSSC)-type devices. It is hoped that by judicious material choice and optimisation of cell design, properties such as tuneable absorption profiles and high extinction coefficients can be exploited to develop high efficiency solid state semiconductor-sensitised solar cells (SSSCs). Recently, Sb2S3-based systems have shown particular promise, with a class-record energy conversion efficiency of 6.3% reported for the TiO2/Sb2S3/PCPDTBT (poly(2,6-(4,4-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene)-alt-4,7(2,1,3-benzo-thiadiazole)) system.1,2 Impressive results have also been achieved with alternative solid state hole transport materials (HTMs), including CuSCN,3–5spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene),6 and P3HT (poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl))2,7 as well as with a cobalt complex-based liquid electrolyte.8
The function of a typical SSSC is based upon photoinduced charge transfer at the TiO2/nanocrystal sensitiser/HTM heterojunctions. Fig. 1 shows the main processes occurring in such systems. Optical excitation of the photoactive layer results in the formation of electrons and holes in the Sb2S3 nanocrystals (Process 1 in Fig. 1). In a functioning device, the photogenerated electrons and holes are transferred to the TiO2 and organic HTM components respectively (Processes 2 and 3 in Fig. 1). The design of efficient SSSC devices crucially depends on the achievement of a high yield of both electron and hole transfer, as well as minimisation of charge recombination losses (Processes 4–7 in Fig. 1). However, control and optimisation of these charge transfer reactions require a fundamental understanding of the key parameters influencing the rates and yields of these processes. Whilst numerous studies have addressed the factors influencing charge transfer in dye-sensitised metal oxide films,9 relatively few have probed nanocrystal-sensitised heterojunctions. This is especially true of Sb2S3-based systems, although recent work has been presented focussing on the application of Impedance Spectroscopy (IS) to fully functioning TiO2/Sb2S3 devices,5,10 as well as the use of chemically resolved electrical measurements.11 In this communication, we describe the use of transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) to probe directly the photoinduced charge transfer processes in TiO2/Sb2S3/spiro-OMeTAD films. The wide bandgap of spiro-OMeTAD makes it a particularly suitable HTM for this study, as it allows photoexcitation to be selectively induced in the coloured Sb2S3 layer.
 Fig. 1  Schematic to show the various charge separation (green arrows) and recombination (red and blue arrows) processes in a functioning TiO2/Sb2S3/spiro-OMeTAD assembly. Absorption of light induces photoexcitation of an electron in Sb2S3 (Process 1). Charge separation occurs through transfer of the photoexcited electron to TiO2 (Process 2) and extraction of the corresponding hole to the spiro-OMeTAD hole transporting material (Process 3). Separated charges are then transported through these respective media to contacts. Competing with the charge separation process is the relaxation of the photoexcited state (Process 4) as well as interfacial recombination of electrons in TiO2 with either holes in the Sb2S3 layer (Process 5) or the HTM (Process 6). A possible additional pathway concerns recombination of electrons in the sensitiser and holes in the HTM (Process 7). 
Specifically, we focus on the effect of varying the absorption onset of the Sb2S3 sensitiser on the yield of long-lived interfacial charge separation. In an SSSC, the potential to optimise the absorption profile of the sensitiser through quantum confinement is hugely attractive, yet variation of the bandgap also means that the alignment of energy levels at the metal oxide/sensitiser/HTM heterojunctions will change. Typically, a bathochromic shift in absorption corresponds to a decrease in conduction band energy and an increase in that of the valence band, which results in less driving force for electron and hole transfer respectively. It has been shown that for a number of SSSC-type systems this can be sufficient to slow electron injection (Process 2 in Fig. 1), which can inhibit charge separation and therefore device performance.12 This effect is likely to become increasingly relevant as further efforts are made to extend SSSC photoresponse into the near infrared. Here, we modulate the absorption onset of a Sb2S3 sensitiser through successive ionic layer absorption and reaction (SILAR) deposition, and use transient absorption spectroscopy to show that the yield of long-lived charge separation across the TiO2/Sb2S3 interface decreases as increasingly red-absorbing Sb2S3 nanocrystallites are excited. This would be expected to inhibit the performance of complete devices by reducing internal conversion efficiency, particularly at longer wavelengths. However, IPCE spectra of TiO2/Sb2S3-based devices reported in the literature do not seem to suffer such limitations.3,6 In the hope of understanding this apparent contradiction, we add the solid-state hole conductor spiro-OMeTAD to the system and probe the hole transfer process (Process 3 in Fig. 1). We determine that not only is the yield of hole transfer considerably less affected by excitation wavelength than the relevant electron injection step, but also that hole transfer can take place on ZrO2 substrates, to which electron injection from Sb2S3 is prohibited. These observations indicate the possibility that photoinduced hole transfer can kinetically compete with electron injection and potentially initiate device function. It is expected that this improved understanding of the nature of charge photogeneration within Sb2S3 SSSCs will aid development of the design rules needed to further improve device performance.
SILAR deposition of Sb2S3 was achieved by alternate immersions of the mesoporous metal oxide films in ethanolic solutions containing either antimony chloride or sodium sulfide (sources of Sb3+ and S2− ions respectively). The constituent ions are able to adsorb to the surface of the TiO2 substrate and react to form Sb2S3. In between immersions, films were washed thoroughly to remove non-adsorbed ions. We note that a single immersion in each of the reactant solutions constitutes one ‘cycle’ of deposition. The films were subsequently annealed under N2 at 300 °C. It was determined that an optimal yield of charge separation is achieved at this temperature (see ESI†).

Fig. 2a shows the UV-Visible absorption spectra of the Sb2S3 sensitised TiO2 films following different numbers of SILAR cycles. The Sb2S3 deposit consists of a broad and inhomogeneous distribution of crystallite sizes, as highlighted by the shape of the absorption spectra. The absorption onset is seen to red-shift towards the bulk value (∼1.7 to 1.8 eV)13 as more deposition cycles are performed, which is characteristic of the SILAR process and typically attributed to the presence of increasingly large nanocrystals.14–17 Raman spectroscopy evidences the presence of the Sb2S3 coating on TiO2, and results are presented in Fig. 2b. As can be seen from these data, thermal annealing at 300 °C under N2 causes sharp peaks to appear in the Raman spectrum at ∼240, ∼280 and ∼310 cm−1 (Fig. 2b), which are characteristic of crystalline stibnite.18 This indicates that the as-deposited films are amorphous in nature, but crystallise when annealed, which is consistent with assertions made in the literature for Sb2S3 deposits on both TiO2 (ref. 3) and ZnO.19 Scanning electron microscopy indicates that the annealed Sb2S3 coating does not cover the TiO2 particles conformally, but rather agglomerates to coat clusters of TiO2 (see ESI†). Similar observations have been reported for chemical bath deposited TiO2/Sb2S3 films.3,6

Next, we investigate interfacial charge transfer in TiO2/Sb2S3/HTM films. Transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) was used to probe the competition between charge separation (Processes 2 and 3 in Fig. 1) and recombination (Processes 4–7 in Fig. 1) processes in such films. Initially, we isolate the TiO2/Sb2S3 interface by excluding the HTM from the film architecture. In this case, photoexcited electrons in the Sb2S3 layer should be injected into the TiO2 whilst corresponding holes remain localised within the nanocrystal sensitiser. As a control, we also probe an analogous mesoporous ZrO2/Sb2S3 system. The conduction band of ZrO2 lies ∼500 meV above that of TiO2, which is thought to energetically prohibit electron transfer from the sensitiser.14,20Fig. 3a shows the transient absorption spectra of a typical SILAR deposited Sb2S3 layer on mesoporous TiO2 and ZrO2 substrates, recorded 10 μs after photoexcitation at 510 nm. A broad positive absorption band centred around ∼800 nm is seen for the TiO2/Sb2S3 films. The absence of any such signal for ZrO2/Sb2S3 samples suggests that photogenerated charges not separated at the metal oxide/Sb2S3 interface recombine on sub-microsecond timescales, and therefore that the transient absorption band seen on TiO2 substrates results from interfacial charge separation. Similar features have been reported for other TiO2/metal sulfide composites and attributed to the photo-oxidised sensitiser species generated as electrons are injected into the metal oxide.21–23 The intensity of absorption is directly proportional to the concentration of absorbing species (which in this case we believe to be holes in the Sb2S3 layer) and therefore here, the relative yield of charge separation across the interface. Additionally, the rate at which this transient absorption band decays describes the lifetime of the separated charges and the dynamics of interfacial recombination.
 Fig. 3  Transient absorption spectra of TiO2/3 SILAR cycles-Sb2S3 and ZrO2/4 SILAR cycles-Sb2S3 recorded 1 μs after photoexcitation at 510 nm (pump intensity = 40 μJ cm−2). Data is shown for samples with similar steady state absorption profiles following thermal annealing at 300 °C. 
In Fig. 4a, we monitor the decay in transient absorption at 800 nm for metal oxide/Sb2S3 films as a function of SILAR deposition cycles. So as to probe the effect of a reduced Sb2S3 bandgap more directly, the laser excitation wavelength λpump is also varied in concurrence with the red-shifting absorption onset.22λpump was selected so as to ensure similar ground state absorbance for the different samples of ∼0.5. The amplitude of the transient absorption signal at 1 μs decreases incrementally with increasing SILAR cycles (and as λpump red-shifts between 450 nm (black trace) and 650 nm (pink trace)), which indicates a reduced level of long-lived interfacial charge separation as Sb2S3 bandgap magnitude decreases. A similar trend is observed when exciting a 6 SILAR cycle Sb2S3 deposit on TiO2 at different excitation wavelengths (see ESI†).

In both (a) and (b), λpump is varied to probe increasingly red-absorbing nanocrystals whilst ensuring similar ground state absorbance (2 SILAR cycles (black trace) – 450 nm excitation, 3 cycles (red) – 510 nm, 4 cycles (blue) – 570 nm, 5 cycles (pink) – 650 nm)).

A diminished yield of long-lived charge separation as Sb2S3 absorption red-shifts is consistent with a reduction in driving force for interfacial electron transfer. In a number of SSSC systems, the reduction in energy, associated with decreasing degrees of quantum confinement, has been shown to directly retard electron injection from the nanocrystal to TiO2.12 Of particular note, Guijarro et al. have used transient grating spectroscopy to observe a reduction in the rate of electron injection from SILAR grown CdSe with an increase in the number of deposition cycles performed.16 A drop in the rate of injection is expected to increase kinetic competition between charge separation and relaxation of the excited state in the sensitiser (Process 2 versus Process 4 in Fig. 1), thus reducing the total yield of charge separation across the heterojunction.20 We note that the differences in long-lived charge separation yield in the TiO2/Sb2S3 assembly could also be due to variations in the rate of interfacial charge recombination (Process 5 in Fig. 1). Whilst this possibility cannot be ruled out unequivocally, the similarity in half time of decay (t50% ≈ 10 μs) from the maxima of each trace at 1 μs leads us to believe that this explanation is less likely. A further contributory factor could be that spatial separation of electron donor and acceptor sites increases as more SILAR cycles are performed.
We now turn to the hole-transfer reaction in the TiO2/Sb2S3/spiro-OMeTAD assembly. In Fig. 4b we use microsecond transient absorption spectroscopy to study the regeneration of the sensitiser species by spiro-OMeTAD. The oxidised spiro-OMeTAD species generated by the regeneration reaction has been shown to exhibit a broad absorption band in the near-IR region, the intensity of which is related to the number of absorbing species.14 Furthermore, an estimated extinction coefficient of 22800 M−1 cm−1 has been reported at 1600 nm, allowing quantitative determination of the number of absorbing species and therefore of the ratio of photogenerated charges per photon absorbed.23 This ratio thus describes the overall efficiency of charge separation across the metal oxide/Sb2S3/HTM heterojunctions at a given time. We note that electrons injected into the TiO2 matrix are also expected to absorb at 1600 nm and could contribute to the observed transient absorption signal, although their extinction coefficient is thought to be much lower than that of the oxidised HTM and so only a small error is induced.24 It is clear from the data presented in Fig. 4b that when excitation wavelength (and absorption onset) red shift, the yield of charge separation is seen to drop from ∼83% for the 2 cycle sample, to ∼69%, 60% and 41% for 3, 4 and 5 cycles respectively. This trend loosely reflects that seen in Fig. 4a, indicating a degree of coupling between the injection and regeneration reactions. This effect is likely to be due to increased kinetic competition between antimony sulfide-localised recombination and electron injection with increasing nanocrystal size, such that the number of holes available to be transferred to the HTM also decreases and overall charge separation efficiency decreases. However, it is pertinent to note that for a 5-cycle film, 41% represents surprisingly extensive hole transfer, given the poor charge separation seen at the TiO2/Sb2S3 interface in this case. Additionally, hole transfer appears to occur when using ZrO2 substrates, as evidenced by the shape of the transient absorption spectrum of a ZrO2/Sb2S3/spiro-OMeTAD film, recorded 1 μs after photoexcitation (Fig. 4c, red trace). For comparison, data is also shown for a ZrO2/Sb2S3 film with no spiro-OMeTAD (blue trace), as well as the absorption spectrum of a solution of spiro-OMeTAD that has been chemically oxidised with N(PhBr)3SbCl6. These observations indicate that photoinduced hole transfer and not only electron injection could initiate device operation, and that this process can also successfully compete with the direct recombination of photogenerated charges within the sensitiser layer (Process 4 in Fig. 1). This is also consistent with our recent observations for analogous Sb2Se3-based films.17 In addition, the rate of decay of the transient signal at 1600 nm is much greater on ZrO2 substrates (Fig. 4b, inset – green trace) than on TiO2. On ZrO2, where electron injection from the Sb2S3 to the metal oxide is prohibited, recombination is likely to occur between electrons localised within the Sb2S3 and holes transferred to the HTM (Process 7 in Fig. 1). This process appears to be faster than the equivalent reaction of electrons in TiO2 (Process 6 in Fig. 1). It is possible that this results from the increased proximity of recombining species when the electron remains in the sensitiser. This effect means that quantitative estimation of the yield of hole transfer on ZrO2 based films is not possible, as unlike for TiO2-based films, no plateau in transient signal is seen. It is important to note that, although long-lived charge separation across the TiO2/Sb2S3 heterojunction becomes inhibited as increasingly large Sb2S3 nanocrystals are excited, it appears that the impact of this effect can be partially offset by effective hole transfer from the sensitiser to the HTM.
Finally, we consider the relevance of these studies to the design of TiO2/Sb2S3 solid-state devices. In an SSSC, extending photoresponse into the near infra-red is vital to the achievement of high performance devices. However, for TiO2/Sb2S3-based devices, our observations indicate that charge separation at the metal oxide/Sb2S3 interface is increasingly limited as the absorption onset of the Sb2S3 sensitiser is red-shifted, which is consistent with work by other groups on analogous TiO2/quantum dot systems.12 In a device, this would be expected to reduce internal quantum efficiency, especially at longer wavelengths, and thus limit performance. On the other hand, we find that significant photoinduced hole transfer to spiro-OMeTAD can take place, even when charge separation at the TiO2/Sb2S3 heterojunction is limited. This implies that hole transfer is also in kinetic competition with the recombination of charges within the Sb2S3 layer and so can itself initiate device operation. In the current device configuration, the electron must ultimately be transferred to the metal oxide; it is possible that the negative charge on the sensitiser nanocrystal added by hole extraction could induce a rise in the energy of the electron excited state and thus encourage electron injection, or that electrons could build up in the sensitiser until electron injection becomes favourable.17,25 Given the increasingly poor charge separation at the TiO2/Sb2S3 interface as the excitation wavelength is red-shifted, such effects are expected to be significant contributory factors to the efficient performance of Sb2S3-based devices. Therefore, focus on further optimisation of the hole transfer reaction should help accelerate the development of these already high performance systems. Indeed, Im et al. have highlighted the benefit of direct interaction between the hole transport material and the Sb2S3 sensitiser to device efficiency.2 One strategy to encourage improved hole transfer could involve the development of surface treatments for the Sb2S3 layer to promote rapid hole extraction.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have used transient absorption spectroscopy to study charge transfer in TiO2/Sb2S3/spiro-OMeTAD systems. We demonstrate that the yield of charge separation at this interface is inhibited as increasingly red-absorbing nanocrystals are excited, which is consistent with a variation in the dynamics of electron transfer as the Sb2S3 excited state energy decreases. Despite this, we observe hole transfer to spiro-OMeTAD even when electron injection appears limited, which indicates that charge separation within the assembly could be initiated by hole transfer. As such, we believe that effective hole transfer is key to efficient performance of TiO2/Sb2S3 devices and that strategies designed to enhance this will be integral to further improvements in cell efficiency.

Broader context
TiO2/Sb2S3-based solar cells have shown great promise as low cost, solution processable photovoltaics and currently lead the semiconductor sensitised solar cell (SSSC) class in terms of power-conversion efficiency. At the operational heart of such devices are a series of interfacial electron transfer reactions that act to separate photogenerated charges. For efficient device performance, the rates and yields of these reactions must be optimised, whilst limiting the effect of competing charge recombination processes. For analogous dye sensitised solar cells (DSSCs), the factors affecting the delicate balance between charge separation and recombination have been studied extensively, yet a comprehensive understanding of the SSSC, particularly that based on Sb2S3, remains limited. It is expected that detailed structure–function relationships for such systems will help establish the design rules necessary for further improvements in efficiency. In this work, we use transient absorption spectroscopy to probe interfacial electron and hole transfer in TiO2/Sb2S3/spiro-OMeTAD systems. Our observations indicate that hole transfer may be able to initiate device function; a phenomenon that should lead to improvements in device performance and the development of novel hybrid inorganic – organic semiconductor solar cell architectures.


 	Fig. 1  Schematic to show the various charge separation (green arrows) and recombination (red and blue arrows) processes in a functioning TiO2/Sb2S3/spiro-OMeTAD assembly. Absorption of light induces photoexcitation of an electron in Sb2S3 (Process 1). Charge separation occurs through transfer of the photoexcited electron to TiO2 (Process 2) and extraction of the corresponding hole to the spiro-OMeTAD hole transporting material (Process 3). Separated charges are then transported through these respective media to contacts. Competing with the charge separation process is the relaxation of the photoexcited state (Process 4) as well as interfacial recombination of electrons in TiO2 with either holes in the Sb2S3 layer (Process 5) or the HTM (Process 6). A possible additional pathway concerns recombination of electrons in the sensitiser and holes in the HTM (Process 7).	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Steady state absorption spectra of TiO2/Sb2S3 nanocrystalline films. Numbers reflect the number of Sb2S3 SILAR deposition cycles performed. All samples are annealed at 300 °C under N2 following SILAR deposition. (b) Raman spectra of (i) a pristine 37 nm TiO2 mesoporous film, (ii) TiO2/Sb2S3 as-deposited and (iii) TiO2/Sb2S3 annealed under N2 at 300 °C; laser excitation at 514 nm.	 

 	Fig. 3  Transient absorption spectra of TiO2/3 SILAR cycles-Sb2S3 and ZrO2/4 SILAR cycles-Sb2S3 recorded 1 μs after photoexcitation at 510 nm (pump intensity = 40 μJ cm−2). Data is shown for samples with similar steady state absorption profiles following thermal annealing at 300 °C.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Transient absorption decay kinetics of Sb2S3-localised holes in metal oxide/Sb2S3/films probed at 800 nm. (b) Transient decay kinetics of spiro-OMeTAD+ absorption in TiO2/Sb2S3/spiro-OMeTAD (main figure) and ZrO2/Sb2S3/spiro-OMeTAD (inset) films probed at 1600 nm. In both (a) and (b), λpump is varied to probe increasingly red-absorbing nanocrystals whilst ensuring similar ground state absorbance (2 SILAR cycles (black trace) – 450 nm excitation, 3 cycles (red) – 510 nm, 4 cycles (blue) – 570 nm, 5 cycles (pink) – 650 nm)). Values of ΔOD are scaled to the number of photons absorbed at λpump. Laser excitation energy density = 26 μJ cm−2 at 450 nm. (c) Transient absorption spectra of ZrO2/Sb2S3 (blue trace) and ZrO2/Sb2S3/spiro-OMeTAD (red trace) recorded 1 μs after photoexcitation at 510 nm (laser excitation energy density = 40 μJ cm−2).
