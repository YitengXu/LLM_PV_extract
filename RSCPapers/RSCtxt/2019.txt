    , Accepted 26th July 2012First published on 26th July 2012AbstractQuasi-1D ZnO nanowires (NWs) ordered as patterned 3D hollow hierarchical urchin-like structures have been prepared on transparent conducting substrates by electrodeposition. The ZnO NWs have been grown on self-assembled ordered polystyrene microspheres with electrical charge densities ranging from 5 to 30 C cm−2 and organized arrays of mono and multi-urchin layers have been built. These layers have been sensitized by the highly absorbing D149 indoline organic dye. The optical characterizations and dye titrations have shown a significant increase in the light scattering and absorption as well as dye loading for the organized structures compared to randomly vertically aligned ZnO NWs grown under the same conditions. The dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) prepared using the sensitized layers have been characterized by current–voltage (J–V) measurements, IPCE and by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. We show that the best performances are obtained for the 3D urchin monolayer structures. The conversion efficiency is increased by up to 4 times compared to their counterparts made of randomly dispersed vertical ZnO NWs. Impedance spectroscopy results show a very fast charge transfer in the ZnO NWs and urchin monolayers and that the electron lifetime is in the 4–14 ms range.
1. Introduction
In the continuous quest for novel applications and high performances, new functionalities have been introduced by simply reducing the size and engineering the architecture of the materials of interest. During the last decade, quasi one-dimensional (1D) oxide structures have shown several advantages with respect to their traditional thin- and thick-film counterparts such as very large surface-to-volume ratio, high roughness, quantum confinement effects, greater stability as a result of the high degree of crystalline order, relatively simple and low-cost preparation methods and possibility of different chemical surface functionalizations.1 ZnO nanowires (NWs) are among the most promising 1D structures for integration in devices and novel applications. They have been used for instance in nanostructured light emitting diodes,2–5 UV nanolasers,6,7 nanosensors5,8 and integrated in structured surfaces with adjustable wettability.9,10 They are also very promising for photovoltaic applications when integrated as building blocks for nanostructured solar cells such as dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC),11–14 quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QD-SSC)15,16 or extremely-thin absorber (ETA) cells.17 Different techniques such as metal–organic chemical vapor deposition, metal–organic vapor phase epitaxy,18,19 vapor–liquid–solid processes,20 molecular beam epitaxy,21 pulsed laser deposition,22 spray pyrolysis,23 sol–gel processing, chemical and electrochemical depositions24,25 have been employed to fabricate ZnO nanowires and nanorods.26 However, among these approaches, electrodeposition has been demonstrated to be very efficient and versatile for the preparation of quasi-vertically aligned ZnO NW array films without7,10,27 and with9,28,29 a pre-deposited seed layer on the substrate.
ZnO has emerged as a promising alternative semiconductor material to TiO2 in DSSC with significant performance improvement achieved during the last few years.30–40 ZnO is a n-type semiconductor combining a large bandgap of 3.37 eV at room temperature and an electron affinity similar to that of TiO2.14 The dynamics of the electron transfer process between the common dyes and ZnO has been found in the subpicosecond range, a value comparable to the dye–TiO2 systems.41 Moreover, single-crystalline ZnO exhibits a good electron transport collection and a fast charge transfer due to its electron mobility higher by 2–3 orders of magnitude than TiO2.12,42
Fast electron transport occurs in single crystalline ZnO or TiO2 1D structure and is interesting to reduce recombination phenomena upon the charge transport process and improve the charge collection efficiency. However, the oxide-NW suffers from a rather low specific surface area. Therefore, the use of highly absorbing fully organic dyes has been shown to be promising for the sensitization of this kind of oxide structure.43,44 Among organic dyes, the indoline D149 is one of the most efficient combined with ZnO NWs.14,43,44 Its enhanced optical absorption provides a means to compensate the low surface area of the aligned ZnO NW structures.14 To enhance the performances of ZnO NW-based DSSC sensitized by organic dyes, it has also been proposed to use the NWs as a backbone of a secondary porous ZnO phase.35 Other authors have successfully used “sea-urchin like” assembled NWs of TiO2 as building blocks of disordered porous oxide layers instead of nanoparticles for DSSC45,46 or QD-SSC.47
In the present work we have investigated for the first time the use of organized hexagonal close-packed networks of ZnO “urchin-like” hollow structures in DSSC devices. The layers have been produced by using a self-organized polystyrene (PS) microsphere template on a transparent conducting glass substrate and the wires have been grown by electrodeposition.48,49 Due to the 3-D organization of these networks, they give rise to a significant increase in the density of nanowires. Moreover, these structures have been reported to present interesting light scattering properties.48 Therefore, a significant increase in the light pathway in the oxide layer is expected to enhance the light trapping. Thereafter, we have compared the performances of common ZnO NW array DSSCs with cells prepared using organized urchin-like ZnO mono- and multilayers. We have also investigated the effect of the ZnO-urchin electrodeposition electrical charge (i.e. NWs' dimensions) on the DSSC photovoltaic properties. The cell functioning and performances have been characterized by various techniques.
2. Experimental
2.1 ZnO structure preparation and characterizations
A commercially available polystyrene microsphere suspension (diameter ∼4.3 μm, 4 wt% aqueous dispersion) from Duke Scientific, U.S.A, was used for dip coating. Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) transparent conductive substrates (SnO2:F, sheet resistance: 10 Ω sq−1, size 2 × 5 cm2) were purchased from Xop Fisica S.L., Spain. The FTO glass substrates were cleaned thoroughly by consecutive sonication in acetone, ethanol, and isopropanol for 15 minutes each. 300 μL of polystyrene microsphere suspension was diluted with an equal volume of ethanol and dispersed (drop-by-drop using a micropipette) onto the surface of deionized water filled into a Petri dish of 8 cm in diameter. After the self-assembling process of polystyrene spheres on the water surface, the FTO substrate was immersed into the solution. The polystyrene sphere monolayer was transferred onto the FTO substrate surface by slow removal from the solution at an angle of 45°.50 Multilayered arrays of urchin structures were obtained by following the same process described above but repeating the first step (deposition of a PS monolayer) three times that gave structures of 4 urchin mono-layers.
Subsequently, the polystyrene sphere covered sample was introduced into a custom made atomic layer deposition (ALD) reactor for synthesizing a thin ZnO film covering homogeneously the spheres and the SnO2:F substrate surface. The ZnO ALD films were deposited using alternating exposures of diethylzinc (DEZ) and water (H2O). The deposition was carried out at 60 °C with the following cycle times: 0.1 s pulse (DEZ), 20 s exposure, and 45 s purge. A 1 s pulse, 20 s exposure and 60 s purge were used for H2O. The time for pulse, exposure, and purge cycles were chosen conservatively to ensure saturation of the ALD surface reactions and to prevent inadvertent mixing of the reactive gases. To obtain a ∼20 nm ZnO film 100 cycles were performed.
The sample, uniformly covered with an ALD ZnO thin film, was then used as the working electrode in a three-electrode electrochemical cell. A platinum spiral wire was used as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. The electrolyte was an aqueous solution saturated by molecular O2 containing zinc chloride as a zinc precursor (5 × 10−4 M) and potassium chloride (1 M) as a supporting electrolyte. The electrodeposition was performed at a constant electrical potential (−1 V) and the charge density was varied between 5 and 30 C cm−2 using an Autolab PGSTAT-30 potentiostat. The bath temperature was set to 80 °C. After electrodeposition, the polystyrene microspheres were dissolved in toluene or burned out in air at 450 °C for 1 h. The above process steps defined the hollow urchin-like ZnO NW building blocks (hollow Ur-ZnO). In order to remove the traces of carbon left over from the dissolution process of polystyrene, the deposited samples were treated with oxygen plasma for 4 minutes. More details about the deposition process can be found elsewhere.47 The nanowire arrays were prepared according to the same procedure (ALD sub-layer of ZnO and electrodeposited ZnO nanowires) done directly on the FTO substrate. The morphology of the samples was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800). The structural properties were analysed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using high-resolution mode (Tecnai F20 FEG at 200 kV). X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded using a Siemens D5000 apparatus operated at 40 kV and 45 mA using the CuKα radiation with λ = 1.5406 Å and a rotating sample holder.
2.2 Cell preparation and characterizations
The ZnO films were sensitized using the D149 metal-free organic indoline dye (Chemicrea, Inc.).35 After treatment at 150 °C for 1 h, the ZnO films were immersed upon cooling into a solution of 0.5 mM D149 and 1 mM cholic acid in a 1:1 volume mixture of acetonitrile–tert-butanol. The impregnation time was 2 h. The counter-electrode was a polished platinum plate. The two electrodes were separated by an adhesive tape and the internal space between the two electrodes was filled with an electrolyte composed of 0.05 M I2 and 0.5 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide in acetonitrile.
The solar cells were illuminated with a solar simulator (Abet Technology Sun 2000) filtered under AM 1.5 conditions. The illuminated surface had an aperture diameter of 4 mm. The power density was calibrated at 100 mW cm−2 by using a silicon solar cell reference. The J–V curves were measured by using a Keithley 2400 digital sourcemeter, at a 5 mV s−1 voltage sweep rate. The impedance spectra were measured at the cell open circuit voltage (Voc) under AM 1.5 filtered 1 sun illumination by using a Solartron FRA1255 coupled with an EGG PAR273 potentiostat. The AC signal was 10 mV and the frequency range was 100 kHz–1 Hz. The spectra were fitted and analyzed using the Zview modeling software (Scribner).
The D149 dye loadings of the photoelectrodes were measured by dye desorption in 2 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF). The dye concentration in solution was subsequently titrated by spectrophotometry using 72350 L mol−1 cm−1 at 530 nm for the D149 molar extinction coefficient. The optical properties of the sensitized films were measured with a Varian Cary5000 spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere. The incident-photon-to-electron-conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves were recorded at the short circuit with a home-made system using a Jobin-Yvon monochromator and a calibrated Newport powermeter.
3. Results and discussions
SEM images of the deposited ZnO structures are presented in Fig. 1. Fig. 1a and b are top views of the ZnO NW arrays grown on the ZnO seed layer deposited by ALD. The electrical charge density for the deposition was 15 C cm−2.

The NWs were vertically aligned and randomly distributed on the surface. In Fig. 1c–f are presented the organized hollow ZnO micro-urchin-shaped structures templated by a self-assembled monolayer of PS spheres (thereafter denoted Mono-Ur ZnO). The urchins follow the initial hexagonal close-packed pattern of the PS spheres. The charge density was varied between 5 C cm−2 and 30 C cm−2. At 5 C cm−2 the wires were dense and small in size (density ∼ 3.2 × 1010 NWs cm−2, diameter ∼ 50 nm, and length ∼ 300 nm). Upon increasing the deposition charge, the observed density lowered and the wires were longer and wider reaching at 30 C cm−2 a density of 1.8 × 1010 NWs cm−2, a diameter of 120 nm, and a length of 850 nm. The growth of a part of the initial wires was blocked upon the deposition process. Similar growth behavior was observed in previous reports on the electrodeposition of ZnO NW arrays on flat substrates.10,51,52 The Mono-Ur layer thicknesses varied from about 4.5 to 5.2 μm with the deposition electrical charge. Using the same technique, it was also possible to grow ZnO NWs on the surface of PS multilayers giving rise to the multi-urchin structure (denoted Multi-Ur ZnO) that is shown in Fig. 1g–i. By comparing Fig. 1d and 1h–i, we observe that at a constant charge density, the wires' aspect and density of a Mono-Ur and a Multi-Ur film are similar.

Fig. 2 compares the XRD patterns of NW-ZnO and Mono-Ur ZnO films. They are characteristic of well-crystallized ZnO with the wurtzite hexagonal structure. We can observe that the films are textured with the c-axis of the wires preferentially oriented perpendicular to the substrate. Due to the 3D organization of the wires in the Mono-Ur sample, they are less textured than the self-standing NW-ZnO arrays. Fig. 3a and c show low and high magnification TEM images, respectively, of an urchin spine. Each spine is a single-crystal with a high structural quality. The selected area electron diffraction pattern (Fig. 3b) confirms that the wires growth along the c-axis. In Fig. 3c, the (0001) interplanar distance is measured to be 0.52 nm.

The layers were sensitized by the D149 indoline organic dye and the optical characterizations of the D149–ZnO structures are reported in Fig. 4. The total transmittance (Fig. 4A) and reflectance (Fig. 4B) spectra are characterized by an edge at about 375 nm (3.3 eV) which corresponds to the bandgap energy of ZnO. There is also a decrease in the transmittance and reflectance centred at about 530 nm due to the light absorption by the dye monolayer adsorbed onto the ZnO surface. The spectra show that the urchin-like structures are more reflecting than the nanowires deposited directly on the conductive glass and that the Multi-Ur structures are more reflecting than the Mono-Ur ones. Fig. 4C shows the absorptance spectra of the sensitized films calculated as A = 100 − T − R. We observed the absorption edge of ZnO in the UV and that the D149 dye absorption intensity order is as follows: NW, Mono-Ur and Multi-Ur. This has been confirmed by the dye titration measurements done for the structures prepared with an electrical charge density of 15 C cm−2. Dye densities of 1.0 nmol cm−2, 3.0 nmol cm−2 and 3.9 nmol cm−2 have been obtained for NW, Mono-Ur and Multi-Ur films, respectively. These values are well-correlated with the roughness factor of the films estimated from the SEM views (Fig. 1) and listed in Table 1. We can note that the dye densities for these structures are much lower than that for our reference ZnO solar cells. For instance, we have measured a density of about 32 nmol cm−2 in the case of a nanoparticulate ZnO layer with a roughness factor higher than 300 sensitized by the D149 dye in the presence of cholic acid.53

The sensitized layers were integrated in DSSC devices and characterized under normalized light illumination. Fig. 5 shows the J–V curves and their characteristics are gathered in Table 1. All cells have rather low fill factors (FF). The lowest value is obtained for the ZnO-NW DSSCs and the maximum is reached for the Multi-Ur. The low FF of ZnO-NWs has been assigned to a poor charge injection efficiency between the excited dye and the oxide under polarization.12 We have also observed that the deposition charge is detrimental for the FF of Mono-Ur solar cells. The cell power conversion efficiencies (η) are presented in Fig. 6a. η of the Mono-Ur cells are much higher than that of the NW cell. The improvement is mainly due to higher short-circuit currents (Jsc) and better Voc (Fig. 6b). The Voc of the presented ZnO-NW cell is rather low compared to our previous data with wires prepared under different electrochemical deposition conditions.14,35 The ZnO ALD sublayer deposited prior to the wire growth must act as a recombination barrier between the FTO substrate and the electrolyte but do not generate a high Voc.

In the case of the Mono-Ur cells, the maximum of cell efficiency was reached for 15 C cm−2 (Fig. 6a). η is multiplied by a factor of 4 compared to the randomly distributed and vertically aligned ZnO-NWs prepared under the same deposition conditions (solution, potential and electrical charge density). The difference is mainly due to the increase in Jsc and a consequence of a higher dye loading (Fig. 4C). We have also observed that Jsc continuously increased with the deposition charge density of the Mono-Ur films (Fig. 6b), but above 15 C cm−2, η decreased due to lower Voc and FF. Our investigation shows that the cell efficiency improvement in the case of Mono-Ur structures compared to NWs is mainly a consequence of a higher surface area and dye loading which result from the high 3D organization/architecture of the NWs in that case. The higher light scattering also improves the sunlight harvesting to a less extent (see below).
The performances of the Multi-Ur cells were intermediate between those of NWs and Mono-Ur structures. We have measured a rather high dye loading and light absorptance for these structures (Fig. 4C). However, Table 1 shows that Jsc of the Multi-Ur cells is rather low. It can be assigned to a weak electrical connectivity between the urchin layers that are not directly in contact with the FTO substrate. Maybe, the formation of dye aggregates occurs in the case of these structures with a complicated shape and confined spaces. Aggregates induce unfavourable charge transfer and quenching of the photo-excited states in DSSCs. They yield high light absorptance and low charge generation.

Fig. 7 compares the incident-photon-to-electron (IPCE) efficiency spectra as a function of the wavelength of a NW-ZnO cell and a Mono-Ur ZnO cell. The IPCE is higher in the case of the 3D organized structure because the dye loading and then the photocurrent are higher. It is worth noting that the normalized IPCE of the Mono-Ur cell shows an obvious red-shift to longer wavelengths compared to the NW-ZnO cell due to a better light scattering in agreement with the reflectance spectra (Fig. 4B). Hence, the photocurrent of urchin-like structured cells is enhanced by both higher dye loading and high light scattering that yield improved light harvesting.

To gain further insight into the functioning of the devices, we have performed impedance spectroscopy measurements under illumination at the Voc of the solar cells. The spectra are presented in Fig. 8A and B. They show the characteristic low-frequency semicircle related to the charge transfer and recombination at the sensitized-oxide/electrolyte interface. The high frequency semicircle is due to the redox reaction of I−/I3− at the platinum counter-electrode. In the case of NW and Mono-Ur ZnO photoelectrodes, the spectra did not show a clear transmission line feature in the mid-frequency range which is commonly attributed to electron transport in the semiconductor oxide.42,54–56 This is probably due to the good conducting properties of the nanowires and the Mono-Ur ZnO structures. For this reason, it was not possible to extract reliable transport resistance values from the spectra and we have limited our study to the recombination behavior of the photoelectrodes. Therefore, the spectra have been fitted with the R//CPE circuit presented in Fig. 8C. Rs is a series resistance mainly due to the electrical contacts. The CPE (with an impedance written ZCPE = 1/Q(jω)a) has been used to take into account the dispersion of capacitances.

(C) Equivalent circuit used for the fittings (solid lines in (A) and (B)). 
The interfacial capacitance, Cint, was deduced from the resistance and CPE parameters according to:57,58 (1) The spectra in Fig. 5 show that 1/Rct can be neglected in eqn (1). Results for Cint and the charge transfer resistances (Rct) are listed in Table 1. It has been pointed out by several authors that, due to the rather large diameter of the wires, Cint of ZnO-NWs must involve in contribution of the space charge capacitance.12 The electron lifetime, denoted τn, can be approximated to RctCint (a notation usually used for DSSC) because the spectra were measured at Voc, a potential at which the space charge contribution to Cint can be neglected. In the case of the Mono-Ur films, we observed an increase in Cint with the deposition electrical charge due to better light absorption. However, no clear effect of the structure was observed on this parameter because some shift in the conduction band level may occur. τn is in the 4–14 ms range which is much shorter than in TiO2 DSSC measured at the Voc (50–100 ms).42 However, the lifetime order of magnitude found is in agreement with our previous studies on other electrodeposited structures35,59 and ZnO nanoparticle photoelectrodes.34
4. Conclusions
We have investigated for the first time the integration of highly organized urchin-like ZnO structures in DSSC photoelectrodes. Quasi-1D nanowires were ordered in a 3D manner to give rise to assembled hollow urchin-like patterns with high light scattering compared to previously reported architectures (NWs, nanoparticles, etc.…). These structures have a higher specific surface area than the randomly vertically aligned ZnO NW arrays and a higher dye loading. Combined with the high light scattering, this led to a significant improvement of Jsc of the fabricated solar cells. An optimized electrical charge exchange of 15 C cm−2 has been found for the growth of Mono-Ur ZnO structures. Impedance spectroscopy study suggests a very efficient charge carrier transfer in these photoelectrodes (NW and Mono-Ur) even if the lifetime is rather short compared to the classical TiO2 ones. Increasing the number of urchin monolayers was detrimental for the cell performances even if the dye loading and light scattering were increased in that case. This has been assigned to a poor electrical connection between the urchin layers and the possible formation of dye aggregates. The impedance spectra suggested a worse electron transfer in that case. Further investigations will focus on the development of hierarchical structures starting from these layers, using the urchin layer as a backbone for the growth of a highly porous secondary phase. Indeed, due to the high light scattering properties of the “urchin” networks, the light trapping should be efficiently improved in the secondary phase.
