    , Accepted 25th March 2020First published on 26th March 2020AbstractColloidal perovskite quantum dots are candidate materials for solution-processable lasers, although stimulated emission in a semiconductor usually occurs in the multiexciton regime. Due to the quantum-confinement effect of semiconductor quantum dots, the non-radiative recombination transition dominates the relaxation of multiexcitons. Hence, the implementation of low-threshold stimulated emission of perovskite quantum dots in the single-exciton regime is meaningful. Herein, we show that this problem can be partially solved by employing a locally enhanced electric field. By applying the metal surface plasmon resonance energy-transfer effect, we demonstrate a considerable reduction of the optical gain threshold due to the newly generated coupling level induced by the local surface plasmon, and obtain optical gain in the single-exciton regime at room temperature in colloidal perovskite quantum dots. At the same time, we achieve a more than fourfold reduction in the amplified spontaneous emission threshold. This may provide a new concept for the further design of low-threshold stimulated emission colloidal nanocrystal lasers and even for improving their energy conversion efficiency.
1. Introduction
Lead halide perovskite colloidal quantum dots (QDs) are attractive materials for inexpensive, room temperature, and solution-prepared photoelectron devices.1–5 As the gain medium in nano-laser systems, QDs show numerous remarkable properties, such as tunable band gap,6 considerable photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields, chemical processability, and excellent photostability compared to organic materials. These properties make them suitable for a wide range of energy conversion applications, such as light-emitting diodes,5 thin-film solar cells,7–10 and nano-lasers.11
However, what cannot be ignored is that low-dimensional nanocrystals are difficult to use for optical amplification and laser emission.12–14 The optical gain in nanocrystal QDs directly relies on emission from multiexciton states, but this is outcompeted by Auger recombination, which typically dominates the relaxation mechanism.12,15 There are two approaches for suppressing Auger recombination rates, the first of which is to increase the dimensions of the nanocrystals or their absorption cross-sections by using large-volume nanostructures. This is contrary to the original intention of preparing nanoscale coherent light sources.16,17 The second approach is to use the optical amplification caused by single-exciton optical gain. In fact, several literature reports have stemmed from thorough research of optical gain mechanisms in optically excited group II–VI colloidal semiconductor QDs.17–20 However, there have been few studies on the single-exciton lasing of lead halide perovskite QDs, although one recent report has concerned single-exciton amplified spontaneous emission in thin films of perovskite nanocrystals and characterization at cryogenic temperatures.21 However, its implementation at cryogenic temperatures (ca. 15 K) was quite difficult. As we demonstrate in the present work, this problem can be solved with a nanocomposite structure. The use of a metal surface plasmon nanocomposite structure leads to a prominent suppression of Auger decay, and the threshold of stimulated emission in perovskite QDs shows a fourfold reduction.
Nanocomposite structures have important applications in a variety of energy conversion systems, such as solar cells,22 photodynamic therapy,23,24 photocatalysis,25,26 and so on. Generally, metal nanoparticles play an indispensable role in energy conversion applications due to their special optical properties. There have been many reports on the application of such nanocomposite structures in solar energy conversion,27 amplification of spontaneous emission (ASE),28 surface plasmon amplification by stimulated emission of radiation (SPASER),29,30 and photocatalysis.26 For metal nanoparticles, the surface plasmon can be limited to the nanometer scale, and the plasmon resonance can be excited without phase-matching conditions,31 which greatly simplifies matters for optical operation. However, regulation of the non-equilibrium energy-transfer process and its exciton quenching mechanism in plasmonic related nano-lasers are still ambiguous.
At the same time, it should not be neglected that the hot electrons induced by plasmon usually relax to their low energy levels on a time scale of less than 500 fs,32 and that direct electron transfer (DET) usually occurs between the plasmonic metal and the semiconductor conduction band when they are in direct contact.26,33–35 It is for this reason that it is almost impossible to achieve energy injection from a metal to a semiconductor in a direct contact nanocomposite system, thus limiting the application of nanocomposite structures in the field of nano-lasers and making it difficult to achieve low-threshold laser emission.
In this work, the mechanism of hot-electron transfer in core–shell nano-lasers is investigated, especially the ultrafast mechanism of energy transfer between localized surface plasmon polaritons (LSPPs) and the coupled exciton. Considering that the localized surface plasmonic effect of metal nanoparticles has been proved to improve the performance of optoelectronic devices,26 the localized metal/insulator nanostructures constitute typical structural models for both the SPASER29 and enhanced single-mode lasers.36,37 Herein, the underlying energy-transfer mechanism in a nano-laser is unambiguously determined in Au@SiO2 core–shell nanostructures embedded with perovskite QDs by femtosecond transient-absorption spectral measurements. With a reasonable band overlap design, the metal plasma absorber converts the incident light energy into localized surface plasmon resonance oscillations, and then transfers the energy to the nearby semiconductor by resonant energy transfer (RET). This means that the cooling carriers in the semiconductor conduction band can be reactivated by plasmonic RET. At the same time, the newly appeared resonance coupling energy level (542 nm) can effectively realize the separation of excitons and carriers and reduces the stimulated emission threshold to the single-exciton regime. The metal plasmon core–shell structure is a candidate design for realizing single-exciton optical gain in nanocrystalline QDs and room temperature sources of single photons.14
2. Material characterization and experimentation
A gold–porous silicon core–shell nanocomposite structure was prepared and CsPbBr3 QDs were loaded in the porous silicon (for preparation details, see the ESI†). The optical properties were analyzed by UV/vis absorption spectroscopy. Spectra were recorded for the colloidal solution of CsPbBr3 QDs loaded in the porous silicon shell without an Au core (blue line) and with an Au core (black line), and of the CsPbBr3 QDs with just the Au core (red line). Emission spectra of the CsPbBr3 QDs with an Au core pumped by low- and high-intensity femtosecond lasers (navy and green lines) were also recorded (Fig. 1a). The Au core showed one strong absorption peak centered at around 549 nm, mainly attributable to its surface plasmon resonance (SPR).7 The CsPbBr3 QDs showed two absorption peaks, that centered at around 520 nm being due to their band gap, and further peak at around 485 nm can be attributed high energy absorption peak.28 The CsPbBr3 QDs have a clear band-gap structure, as can be discerned from the SPR band of Au based on the transient absorption spectrum in the visible range. Moreover, the CsPbBr3 QDs with an Au core showed a new shoulder peak near the SPR peak, implying strong coupling between the surface plasmon of the Au core and the CsPbBr3 QDs. The PL emission spectrum features a peak at 525 nm upon excitation at 400 nm and an amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) at 542 nm with a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 5.5 nm. The inset in Fig. 1(a) is a schematic illustration of the CsPbBr3 QDs loaded on an Au–porous silicon core–shell structure.

(d) Field distribution of the z-axis component in the dipole vibration mode of Au@SiO2 nanostructures. 
In order to observe the laser emission from CsPbBr3 QDs–Au, a powdered sample was evenly sandwiched between two pieces of quartz at a thickness of 1 mm and pumped by femtosecond pulses at a wavelength of 400 nm. The repetition rate was 1000 Hz, the pulse width was less than 120 fs, and the focal spot diameter of the excitation beam was about 4 mm. An optical fiber spectrometer (Ocean Optics) was used to collect spectral signals. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the emission spectral signals excited by different pump energies were collected, and with the increase of pump laser power, a narrow peak appeared at a center wavelength of 542 nm. Spontaneous emission dominated at low excitation intensities up to the onset of lasing near 5 mJ cm−2 (power threshold). A linear PL increase indicative of ASE ensued, the intensity of which was greater than that of the spontaneous emission background. The output power showed a linear dependence on the excitation intensity. The inset in Fig. 1(b) shows the intensity of the spontaneous emission peaks as a function of the pumping energy. The results show that the input–output curve has obvious threshold characteristics of spontaneous laser emission. The results of a control study of a non-metallic core structure model which similar the CsPbBr3 QDs–Au are presented in Fig. S1 (ESI†). For this, CsPbBr3 QDs were loaded in a porous silicon shell from which the Au core had been removed. The fluorescence emission peak positions and spontaneous emission peak positions were seen to be shifted when no Au core was present in the system (Fig. S2, ESI†). The Fig. 1(c) shows a transmission electron microscopy image and corresponding nanoscale elemental mappings of Au, Si, Cs, Pb, and Br of CsPbBr3 QDs with an Au core. The results show that the CsPbBr3 QDs were uniformly loaded in the nanocomposite structure.
To assess the dynamic photon–plasmon coupling between CsPbBr3 QDs and the Au nanocores, theoretical numerical simulations were performed with the commercial software package COMSOL Multiphysics. As shown in Fig. 1(d), the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) results in a significantly enhanced local electromagnetic field in the surface region (ca. 25 nm) of the Au core. Theoretical results show that the CsPbBr3 QDs are exclusively distributed in the region of enhanced electric field. The LSPR-induced local electromagnetic field is well known to facilitate the generation of electron–hole pairs in a semiconductor.32 In this work, we roughly regulated the distance between the QDs and the Au core by controlling the thickness of the mesoporous silica shell at 25 nm. This ensured that QDs were distributed in the environment of enhanced local electromagnetic field.
Here, the exciton number of low pump fluence (3 mJ cm−2) was in the range 0.08–0.23, and that of the high pump fluence (12 mJ cm−2) was in the range 0.32–0.92. The exciton number of the threshold pump fluence (5 mJ cm−2) was in the range 0.14–0.38. The exciton number 〈N〉 in QDs can be calculated according to 〈N〉 = σjp, where σ is the QD absorption cross-section and jp is the per-pulse photon fluence at the excitation wavelength. The absorption cross-section is a parameter that is strongly dependent on the particle size or volume. In this work, based on an HAADF-STEM image, the QDs were estimated to be about 8.5–13 nm in diameter. For CsPbBr3 QDs, the reported average value of the 3.1 eV cross-section is (1.3 ± 0.6) × 10−14 cm2 for nanocubes with sides of 9.3 nm.38 Here, we take this value as the absorption cross-section of the QDs, and all the exciton numbers conform to 〈N〉 < 1. This means that we obtained the optical gain in the single-exciton regime. In order to investigate the mechanism of single-exciton optical gain induced by surface plasmons in perovskite QDs, we prioritized the non-equilibrium carrier and energy-transfer transport between the LSPPs and excitons. We also noticed that the lasing threshold (5 mJ cm−2) here was nearly an order magnitude higher than those reported for the same material (of the order of hundreds of μJ cm−2) in recent literature reports. The lasing threshold of perovskite QDs has been reported as 235 and 374 μJ cm−2.37,39 We attribute this difference to the low loading level of the perovskite QDs in our mesoporous nanocomposite structure system compared to absolute perovskite QDs samples.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 2 shows the excited state of dynamics at low and high pump intensities. In this study, samples under high-power excitation were taken as the main content. Transient absorption spectra (TAS) of CsPbBr3 QDs–Au core after high pump power excitation at 400 nm showed ground state of bleaching (GSB) band at around 520 nm, a stimulated emission band (SE) at around 549 nm, and a derivative-like feature of a higher energy excited-state absorption band (ESA) at around 480 nm. In addition to these exciton-band features, a broad photoinduced absorption band (PA) at a wavelength longer than 585 nm was formed, with a rise time of the order of 0.5 ps.

In (b), the SE feature is manifested as a typical signal with high pump fluence. (c) Relative absorption variation as a function of wavelength for time delays ranging from 250 fs to 7 ns with low-power 400 nm pumping for CsPbBr3 QDs–Au. (d) Relative absorption variation as a function of wavelength for time delays ranging from 2 ps to 6 ns with high-power 400 nm pumping for CsPbBr3 QDs–Au. 
In Fig. 2(d), during the initial few picoseconds, the GSB and SE bands were not quite decentralized, both being enwrapped within a broad wave packet. Thereafter, the SE band was greatly attenuated and completely disappeared within 300 ps; however, the recovery time scale was comparable with that of the low-power-pumped sample. This indicated that the stimulated emission process in the CsPbBr3 QDs–Au cores had a larger transition rate under high pump power, providing direct evidence for ASE. Similar experimental phenomena have recently been reported, whereby time-resolved fluorescence data supported the trend of shorter fluorescence lifetimes.11,39,40
The ESA band is a broad feature; the absorption center shows a clear red-shift with the decay time, and it decays within 1 ns. Obviously, the GSB process has a shorter recovery time (ca. 100 ps) in the case of high-power pumping than in the case of low-power pumping (ca. 1 ns). This phenomenon can be related to the process of nano-lasing in CsPbBr3 QDs-Au.1,28,37

Fig. 3(a) shows the peak-fitting of a typical transient absorption spectrum obtained in this work, we selected the transient spectrum curve with the early delay time of 1 ps, and the pump fluence is 12 mJ cm−2, and the fitting results could be deconvoluted into four absorption bands. The fitting curve comprises four main sections, based on ESA (purple), GSB (green), SE (blue), and PA (red). Fig. 3(b) shows the relationship between the peak position of the SE band and time during the first nanosecond, which can be fitted by a single exponential function. The calculated lifetime is about 340 fs. The SE band center showed a blue-shift, implying that within this short duration after the pump laser, the excited state of the CsPbBr3 QDs reached a higher stable potential-energy surface (the PL peak shifted from 549 to 542 nm). This can be explained in terms of strong coupling between the surface plasmon of the Au core and the CsPbBr3 QDs. The value of 340 fs is consistent with the metal surface plasmon relaxation time scale (hundreds of fs). Here, we observed direct evidence for transport and energy transfer between photogenerated excitons in the perovskite and the LSPP in the Au core. Furthermore, the ESA band center showed a red-shift of about 0.1 eV in 500 ps and no isoabsorptive point, which can be regarded as indicating relaxation of the excited state.

Through standard fitting and quantitative analysis of the curves in Fig. 4, we first confirmed the occurrence of population inversion in the excited state and established a model for the excited-state dynamics in the system. The kinetic signals were fitted according to a multi-exponential function, which can be described as: (1)In this expression, τi is the decay time, αi represents the amplitude at t = 0, and i denotes the number of decay times. The kinetic signals were analyzed by a fitting procedure (Igor Pro, program Version 6.37, Wave-metrics, Inc., Portland, OR). The fitting data are shown in Table 1 and Table S1 (ESI†).

Fig. 4 shows time-resolved TA spectra of CsPbBr3 QDs–Au cores at high-power laser pumping, probed at 480, 520, 545, and 610 nm, respectively. Here, in order to separate the GSB and SE band regions as much as possible, the probing wavelength is 545 nm instead of 540 nm. An ultrafast laser incident upon this type of nanocomposite structure can induce many different excited-state relaxation processes. Here, we briefly outline event sections; we will focus on the individual processes afterwards. We describe four main sections based on (1) ESA, (2) GSB, (3) SE, and (4) PA.
Compared to the control group (Fig. S3, ESI†), a reasonable analysis is as follows:

Fig. 4(a) shows the first section. The selected ESA kinetic curve (probed at 480 nm) can be fitted with multi-exponential functions and yields three decay time constants: τ1 = 9 ps (57%), τ2 = 23 ps (10%), and τ3 = 500 ps (33%). The kinetic signals then return to zero. τ1 (on the time scale of 10 ps) can be ascribed to the interaction between phonons and carriers in the conduction band. The much longer τ2 and τ3 (on the time scale of tens to hundreds of ps) can be assigned to charge transfer from the semiconductor conduction band to the Au core, and the different lifetime scales can be ascribed to the detrapping of the trapped electrons at different trap depths. It is worth noting that, in the CsPbBr3 QDs–Au cores, the GSB signal can be attributed to the state with filling of the electron level, with negligible contribution from the hole due to a higher degeneracy of hole levels.

Fig. 4(b) shows the second section. The selected GSB kinetic curve (probed at 520 nm) can be fitted with multi-exponential functions and yields three decay time constants: τ1 = 6 ps (47%), τ2 = 135 ps (49%), and τ3 = 681 ps (4%). The kinetic signals then return to zero. τ1 can be ascribed to the process of exciton nonradiative recombination between the valence and conduction bands, the second lifetime component τ2 is associated with the transfer of plasmon-induced carriers from the Au cores to the valence-band carriers of the QDs, and the longest lifetime component τ3 can be ascribed to the hole-filling conduction band. The τ3 component (681 ps) is clearly much slower than that (3.5 ps) in the control group. This anomalous phenomenon is caused by an increase in excitation power density, which can be explained as a direct result of the phase-state filling (Pauli blocking effect).41,42

Fig. 4(c) shows the third section. The selected SE kinetic curve (probed at 545 nm) can be fitted with multi-exponential functions, and yields two decay time constants: τ1 = 6 ps (80%) and τ2 = 146 ps (20%). The fast component (τ1) can be ascribed to exciton nonradiative recombination, as in the analysis of the GSB kinetic curve. The slower component (τ2) can be ascribed to exciton radiative recombination.

Fig. 4(d) shows the fourth section. The selected PA kinetic curve (probed at 610 nm) can be fitted with a multi-exponential decay with time constants of τ1 = 1.6 ps (47%) and τ2 = 17 ps (19%) plus an offset. The fast component (τ1) can be ascribed to the final arrival of the equilibrium carriers through carrier–(optical) phonon scattering. The component τ2 can be ascribed to the biexciton lifetime.43 The offset in this case is probably due to the photobleaching caused by the Stark effect16 or larger absorption cross-sections induced by the high pump power.44
Next, we describe the carrier quenching mechanism in a non-equilibrium state of the CsPbBr3 QDs–Au nanocomposite structure. Fig. 5 shows the photoinduced carrier quenching processes of this system at different pump powers, that is, low-power density pumping (a) and high-power density pumping (b). From the lowest-energy excitonic band centered at around 480 nm and the bulk band-edge positions, we estimated the potentials of the lowest electron and hole levels as ca. 3.7 and 6.3 V, respectively, versus the vacuum values (details in the ESI,† eqn (S1) and (S2)).45 In general, these values are agreed with the results presented in other literature.46,47
 Fig. 5  Schematic diagrams of the dynamic mechanism of the excited state under low-power-density pumping (a) and high-power-density pumping (b). Also shown are relevant levels in the CsPbBr3 QDs–Au (conduction band (CB), valence band (VB), and hole-trap) and the Au core (Fermi level (Ef)). The blue and yellow arrows indicate charge separation and recombination processes, respectively. The red arrows indicate plasmonic induced resonance energy transfer (ET) from the Au core to the VB in CsPbBr3 QDs; e–h NR denotes the electron–hole non-radiative transition. 
The two diagrams in Fig. 5 show four main differences. Firstly, the energy system has a higher excited-level population under higher power density excitation conditions: the calculated average lifetimes are 1.2 ns and 127 ps, respectively. The excited-state carriers have a higher transition probability from the CB of the QDs to the Au core (increasing from 1.1 × 107 s−1 and 1.4 × 106 s−1 (88 ps, 711 ps) to 4.3 × 107 s−1 and 2 × 106 s−1 (23 ps and 500 ps)). Secondly, the energy system has an energy-transfer mode involving plasmon-induced resonance energy transfer from the Au core to the CB in CsPbBr3 QDs under high-power-density excitation conditions. Thirdly, the blockade in the CB of the CsPbBr3 QDs limits electron transfer in the hole-filling in the VB (3.5 ps to 680 ps). Fourthly, e–h nonradiative recombination (NR) between the CB and VB of QDs under different pump powers has different transition probabilities. With the increase of pump power, the transition probability of e–h NR becomes smaller, from 6.25 × 108 s−1 (1.6 ps) to 1.7 × 108 s−1 (5.8 ps). This abnormal phenomenon is caused by VB filling of the CsPbBr3 QDs induced by plasmon resonance and charge separation in the Au cores.
If we consider QDs as an independent energy system in which energy is conserved, the energy conversion efficiency (QY) of the system can be simply expressed as: (2)where K is the radiation transition coefficient, which is a constant in this system, and ΔOD542nm and ΔOD520nm represent the maximum absorptions at the respective specified wavelengths in the transient absorption spectrum. Here, QYhighpumped = 2.12 and QYlowpumped = 0.82. The value of 2.12 is twice the limit of energy conversion efficiency (100%), indicating that the energy system has obtained supplementary external energy. In this work, the LSPR effect of the Au core is the source of the supplementary energy. The theoretical energy-transfer rate can be calculated according to the following equation:48 (3)where ε′′(ω) is defined by the metal dielectric function ε(ω) = ε′(ω) + iε′′(ω), ωSP is the frequency at the SPASER peak, μ is the quantum emitter dipole matrix element, a is the radius of the Au nanocore, and d is the distance from the surface of the Au core to the emitter (QDs). In this work, a is about 25 nm, and d is in the range from 0 to 25 nm.
The threshold condition of a plasmonic induced laser system can be described as follows:29,48,49 (4)where τ is the excitation relaxation time, NE and NB are the numbers of quantum emitters in the excited and ground states, respectively, and Q is the mode quality factor; μ is the quantum emitter dipole matrix element, another term for which is the dipole moment of the LSPR, which can be calculated from Mie theory as follows:26 (5)
In eqn (5), ε is the dielectric constant and a is the Au nanoparticle radius. According to the above, there are four possible ways to achieve the laser threshold: extending the excited-state lifetime, enhancing population inversion, compressing mode volume, and increasing the quality factor Q. In most single-particle cavities, however, the plasmon mode is highly confined, which means that Q is almost constant. In this work, the strong coupling between the surface plasmon of the Au core and the CsPbBr3 QDs makes energy transfer between them a reality. This results in excited-state absorption of the carrier in the CB of CsPbBr3 QDs and enhanced population inversion in the laser system.
In this nanostructure, the LSPR of the Au core plays a key role. A similar nanostructure without an Au core was prepared for a control experiment, and its PL spectrum was quite different from that of CsPbBr3 QDs–Au. The pump power threshold for the ASE phenomenon reached 22 mJ cm−2, much higher than that for CsPbBr3 QDs–Au (5 mJ cm−2). The surface plasmon polaritons induced a fourfold reduction. In addition, its ASE peak was also different from that of CsPbBr3 QDs–Au, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). When the Au core was removed, the ASE peak shifted from 542 nm to 515 nm. This indicates that the Au core reduces the threshold of ASE pump laser power, and regulates the mode of laser emission. Through the LSPR effect of the Au cores, they can transfer energy to the CB of CsPbBr3 QDs, thereby facilitating light-induced absorption of the energy in the excited state. This reduces the nonradiative relaxation of the excited state, and enhances the population inversion, accounting for the lower threshold of ASE based on eqn (4).
The plasmon-induced hot-electron-transfer from a metal to a semiconductor is still inefficient, because hot electrons can quickly relax to lower energy levels through ultrafast electron–electron and electron–phonon scattering.50,51 The direct charge transfer of excited-state carriers from CsPbBr3 QDs to Au cores is a process of energy loss, and for this reason the threshold value of this nano-laser is high; the inhibition of carrier transfer between CsPbBr3 QDs and Au cores is a further way to reduce the laser ASE threshold. Therefore, in addition to enhancing the coupling of LSPPs (metal) and excitons (QDs), preventing direct contact between the gain dielectric material and the plasmonic metal core can also enhance energy conversion efficiency in a nano-laser.
Having delineated the non-equilibrium energy-transfer process and its exciton quenching mechanism in nano-lasers, the mechanism of the plasmon-RET-effect-induced low-threshold lasing of the nanocrystal in the single-exciton regime requires further discussion. With the increase of the excitation fluence (to 〈N〉 ≈ 1), the multiexciton effect becomes more prevalent. We have attributed the shortest lifetime component (τ1) of ESA to the interaction between phonons and carriers in the CB, and τ1 of the high excitation fluence (0.32–0.92) and low excitation fluence (0.08–0.23) are 9.1 ps (57%) and 1.5 ps (60%), respectively. This suggests that an increase in exciton number (〈N〉) does not promote the interaction between excitons (carrier) and phonons; on the contrary, the probability of their interaction (∝ 1/τ1) becomes lower. One possibility for inhibiting the interaction between the excitons (carrier) and phonons is the formation of plasmon resonance coupling levels in the CB.
In traditional semiconductor QDs, the quantum confinement effect causes the carrier energy level to change from a continuous state to discrete states. When the excitation fluence is increased, exciton relaxation in semiconductor QDs tends towards exciton–exciton annihilation and Auger nonradiative recombination.16,38 Carriers may also cause lattice vibration and spectral broadening through electro-acoustic interaction.52,53Fig. 6 shows a schematic diagram of low-threshold lasing of perovskite QDs in the single-exciton regime. Compared with the bulk material, semiconductor nanocrystals have a discrete set of energy levels because of quantum confinement effects.54 When the semiconductor QDs located in the local plasmon electromagnetic field, due to the LSPR effect, the discrete levels in the CB are coupled with the LSPR level, and Fig. 3(b) have shown the newly formed coupling level (542 nm). The lifetime of the LSPPs and excitons was determined as 340 fs, which is shorter than τ1 (interaction between phonons and carriers in the CB) of ESA. The introduced coupling energy level can help us to interpret the details. This result implies that when the excitation fluence is increased, the cooling charge carriers can be reactivated by the plasmon RET process. The fast transfer of relaxed excitons from the bottom of the CB to the coupling level reduces the multi-exciton quenching, leading to the accumulation of excitons. At the same time, it is of great benefit for realizing population inversion in the lasering medium in the single-exciton regime.

4. Conclusion
The present work represents a practical demonstration of low-threshold lasing of perovskite QDs in the single-exciton regime. The dynamic mechanism of the excited state of CsPbBr3 QDs with an Au core has been described in detail. TAS allows the direct observation of plasmon RET between photogenerated excitons in CsPbBr3 QDs and the Au core, and the coupling resonant response time between LSPPs and excitons is about 340 fs. The results show that the plasmon RET can provide a supplement for the lasing of semiconductor QDs and reduces the stimulated emission threshold. The plasmon resonance effect increases the degeneracy of energy levels of the CB edge and forms a new coupling level with the LSPR level. Formation of the coupled energy level facilitates the optical gain required for population inversion and the optical amplification due to single excitons. From a wider perspective, we have developed a plasmonic core–shell nanocomposite structure for nanoscale lasing and this approach may provide a new concept for the design of low-threshold lasing of colloids in the single-exciton regime and the miniaturization of coherent light sources.
