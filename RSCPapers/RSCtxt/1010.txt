    , Accepted 21st February 2011First published on 9th March 2011AbstractWe demonstrate a new strategy for preparation of ZnO/ZnS core–shell nanorods via microwave-assisted in situ surface sulfidation of ZnO nanorods. This is a facile and rapid process, requiring only a low level of microwave irradiation (400 W), through which a conformal ZnS nanoparticle layer is deposited onto the ZnO nanorods, while retaining the uniformity of the original ZnO nanorods in the as-prepared ZnO/ZnS hybrid structures with excellent fidelity. Furthermore, the thickness and nanoparticle size of the ZnS shell can be conveniently varied or controlled by the concentration of the organo-sulfur source thioacetamide (TAA). The as-prepared products exhibit narrowed band gap and strong orange luminescence at 621 nm, due to the interstitial oxygen ion defect present in hydrothermally grown ZnO. However, the PL intensity gradually decreases with the increase of the thickness of ZnS shell, indicating charge transfer between the two components of the ZnO/ZnS hybrids. Further investigation has revealed that the hybrid nanostructures possess significantly higher visible light photocatalytic activity which is twice that of the original ZnO nanorods. The mechanisms of the optimal ZnS shell thickness to reach the maximum photocatalytic activity in the ZnO/ZnS core-shell hybrid are proposed and discussed. It is believed that this facile, rapid microwave-assisted strategy is scalable and its application can be extended synthesize other oxide/sulfide (MOx/MSy) core-shell nanostructures for different applications.
Introduction
Due to the emitting of toxic and coloured wastewater into water bodies, dyes seriously affect the nature of water, inhibit sunlight penetration and reduce photosynthetic reaction.1 The traditional techniques for the treatment of dye waste effluents are usually non-destructive, inefficient and costly or just transfer the pollution from water to another phase.2 Recently, heterogeneous semiconductor nanostructures such as TiO2 and ZnO as photocatalysts have been proven to be very efficient catalysts for the removal of dye pollutants from water.3–6 However, the poor utilization of solar energy and the short diffusion length of a photogenerated electron–hole pair are the two major factors limiting the further improvement of photocatalytic efficiency. Therefore, an indispensable and challenging issue in this field is the development of new and efficient sunlight-sensitive photocatalysts.7 In order to accelerate the charge carrier separation, an interesting approach involves coupling two separate semiconductors possessing different energy levels for their corresponding conduction and valence bands. The improvement of photocatalytic activity has been attributed to the synergetic effect between the coupled semiconductors and photocatalysis caused by their suitable band levels.8,9
As an important II–VI semiconductor, zinc oxide (ZnO) has a wide band gap energy of 3.37 eV with a large binding energy (EB = 60 meV). It is an excellent candidate for photocatalysts, photodetectors, and ultraviolet laser.10 Furthermore, ZnO has shown higher photocatalytic efficiencies for the degradation of several dye pollutants in both acidic and basic medium than TiO2.11,12 ZnS, having a wider band gap (Eg = 3.7 eV) than ZnO, is a well-known photocatalyst due to the rapid generation of electron–hole pairs by photoexcitation and the highly negative reduction potentials of excited electrons, which is applicable for the photodecomposition of various organic substrates.13 In addition, theoretical calculations and experimental results have demonstrated that the combination of these two wide bandgap semiconductors can yield a novel material with the photoexcitation threshold energy lower than the individual components.14 Recently, one-dimensional (1D) ZnO and ZnS nanomaterials have attracted much attention because of their potential applications in nanoscale electronics, optics, and other novel devices.15 Up to now, there are a few reports on the fabrication of 1D ZnO/ZnS core–shell nanostructures by various methods including chemical vapour deposition, thermal sulfidation, ion exchange in vapour, chemical solution route, thioglycolic acid assisted hydrothermal process.16–21 However, some of these methods required vacuum or high temperatures and hence difficult to be scaled up, while the other methods needed catalyst or surface template which brings in unnecessary impurities in the materials. Therefore, there is a need for alternative methods which are scalable, more tractable and produce high purity metal-oxide/metal-sulfide core–shell nanostructures.
Microwave irradiation is an attractive and facile method for rapid synthesis of nanocrystals with small particle size, narrow particle size distribution, and high purity.22–25 Very recently, we reported a microwave-assisted route for uniform coating of CdS nanoparticles on the surface of colloidal carbon spheres.26 In this manuscript, we reported a new scalable microwave-assisted method for one-step in situ synthesis of ZnO/ZnS core–shell nanorods (NRs) through a controlled surface sulfidation of ZnO NRs. Through this process, the as-prepared hybrid structures preserved the good dispersity and uniformity of initial ZnO NRs, and the thickness of shell and ZnS nanoparticle size could be varied or controlled by the concentration of thioacetamide (C2H5NS, TAA). The photoluminescence (PL) properties of the as-prepared ZnO NRs and ZnO/ZnS hybrid nanostructures were studied, which exhibit narrowed band gap and strong orange luminescence at 621 nm (λex = 325 nm). It may be attributed to the interstitial oxygen ion defect introduces into ZnO in the low-temperature hydrothermal growth process. Moreover, the intensity of PL would gradually decrease with the increase of the thickness of ZnS shell. In addition, the as-prepared products exhibit the excellent photocatalytic activity toward the decomposition of rhodamine-B (RhB) when exposed to visible light irradiation. It was found that there was an optimal ZnS thickness for the best photodegradation activity.
Experimental
All reagents were of analytical grade, purchased from the Shanghai Chemical Reagent Manufacturing Co., and used as received without further purification.
Synthesis of ZnO NRs
In a typical procedure, 0.54 g of zinc chloride was dissolved in 40 mL of distilled water forming a clear solution, and added the appropriate quantities of ammonia (25%) to adjust the pH value to 10.0. The mixed solution was sealed in a bottle and maintained at 90 °C for 4 h. Subsequently, the white ZnO NRs were washed repeatedly with distilled water and ethanol for several times, and then dried in an oven at 60 °C for 6 h.27
Synthesis of ZnO/ZnS core–shell NRs via microwave irradiation
In a typical procedure, a 0.05g portion of ZnO NRs and a pre-determined amount TAA were added into a round-bottom flask and dispersed in 20 mL of distilled water with the assistance of sonication for 10 min. Then, the above mixture was placed in a microwave refluxing system irradiated at 400 W for 30 min to prepare the ZnO/ZnS core–shell NRs. After centrifugation, the final samples were washed with ethanol and distilled water three times before drying in a vacuum at 60 °C for 6 h. To investigate the effect of TAA on the formation of ZnO/ZnS hybrid nanostructures, the different concentration of TAA was used in sulfidation process, while the other conditions remain unchanged. Products prepared with different amount of TAA (0, 0.0025, 0.0075, 0.0125, 0.0175 and 0.0225 M) after the microwave irradiation route were assigned sample codes as Sa (pure ZnO NRs), Sb, Sc, Sd, Se and Sf, respectively (Table 1).

Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of the samples were performed with a Philips PW3040/60 X-ray diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation at a scanning rate of 0.06° s−1. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed with a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microanalyzer with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) were conducted at 200 kV with a JEM-2100F field emission TEM. Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) was performed with spectroscope attached to HRTEM. Samples for TEM measurements were prepared for TEM by dispersing the products in ethanol and placing several drops of the suspension on holey carbon films supported by copper grids. PL spectra were recorded on an Edinburgh FLSP920 fluorescence spectrometer and the absorption spectra were measured using a PerkinElmer Lambda 900 UV-vis spectrophotometer at room temperature.
Photocatalytic activity of ZnO/ZnS core–shell NRs
Photocatalytic activities of ZnO/ZnS core–shell NRs were evaluated by the degradation of RhB under visible light irradiation of a 500 W Xe lamp (CEL-HXF300) with a 420 nm cutoff filter. The reaction cell was placed in a sealed black box with the top opened, and the cutoff filter was placed to provide visible-light irradiation. In a typical process, 0.05 g of as-prepared ZnO/ZnS hybrid nanorods as photocatalysts were added into 100 ml of RhB solution in distilled water (concentration: 3 mg L−1), respectively. After being dispersed in an ultrasonic bath for 5 min, the solution was stirred for 2 h in the dark to reach adsorption equilibrium between the catalyst and the solution and then was exposed to visible light irradiation. The samples were collected by centrifugation at given time intervals to measure the RhB degradation concentration by UV-vis spectroscopy.
Results and discussion
Hydrothermally grown27 ZnO nanorods were first placed in TAA solution in water. Rapid conversion of ZnO NRs into ZnO/ZnS core–shell NRs can be achieved in a microwave refluxing system at relatively low power of 400 W. The size of ZnS nanoparticles and the thickness of ZnS deposited on the ZnO NRs are remarkably uniform. The core-shell ZnS/ZnO hybrid NRs maintain the original ordering or alignment structures of the ZnO NRs, while the thickness of ZnS shell can be tuned by varying parameters such as TAA concentration. This low temperature process for rapid surface sulfidation is environmentally sustainable. The principle of synthesis of ZnO/ZnS core–shell NRs is described in Scheme 1. First, TAA reacts with H2O to form CH3(NH2)C(OH)–SH via microwave irradiation (eqn (1)), which further hydrolyzes releasing H2S (eqn (2)).28 CH3CSNH2 + H2O → CH3(NH2)C(OH) + SH(1) CH3(NH2)C(OH)SH + H2O → CH3(NH2)C(OH)2 + H2S(2)

Then, H2S readily reacts with ZnO at the surface of the ZnO nanorods to produce ZnS nuclei (eqn (3)).29 H2S + ZnO → ZnS + H2O(3)
Accordingly, heterogeneous nucleation took place on the surface of the ZnO NRs and a large quantity of ZnS nuclei clinging to the ZnO NRs were produced simultaneously. The microwave heating can improve the nucleation rate to form ZnS nuclei around the sites, which can be catalytic toward the decomposition of TAA.22 With the process of reaction, the ZnS nuclei would grow larger and larger to form ZnS nanoparticles, which result in ZnO/ZnS core-shell NRs were formed finally.

Fig. 1 shows the XRD pattern of the as-prepared pure ZnO NRs (pattern a). All the diffraction peaks can be indexed as the wurtzite phase of ZnO with lattice constants of a = 3.250 Å and c = 5.207 Å, which is consistent with the standard XRD data file of ZnO (JCPDS standard card no. 79-2205). No impurity peaks are detected showing that the products are pure phase. Patterns b, c, d, e and f belong to the as-prepared ZnO/ZnS core-shell NRs, obtained by adding different concentration of TAA via microwave-assisted method. The patterns obviously consist of two sets of diffraction peaks (ZnO and ZnS), and the broadening of the diffraction peaks match well with face-centered cubic (fcc) ZnS (JPCDS standard card no. 79-0043, a = 5.318 Å). Because the peaks of (220) and (311) crystal planes of ZnS are very adjacent to the diffraction peaks of (102) and (110) of ZnO, these peaks are overlapped together, respectively. With the increase of TAA concentration, the diffraction intensity of ZnS (111) crystal plane becomes strong gradually, which indicates that the ZnS nanoparticles grow larger and larger gradually. In addition, the average size of ZnS nanoparticles as the concentration of TAA increase, calculated using the Debye–Scherrer equation based on the full width at half-maximum of the diffraction peak, are 3.5, 5.6, 8.9, 13.4 and 14.3 nm, respectively (see Table 1).

The SEM image of ZnO NRs and the ZnO/ZnS core–shell NRs synthesized using different concentrations of TAA are shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2a shows the pure ZnO hexangular rods of about 120 nm in diameter with smooth surface. From Fig. 2b–f, obvious morphological changes can be observed. With increasing concentration of TAA, the surface of the ZnO NRs became rougher and thicker, implying an increasing conversion from ZnO to ZnO/ZnS hybrid structures via the surface sulfidation. Further morphology and structure characterizations of the as-prepared samples are shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3a shows a representative TEM image, HRTEM image (inset) and its corresponding SAED pattern (inset) of ZnO NRs. The clear lattice fringes of HRTEM image confirm that the product is a single crystal. The fringe spacing is about 0.52 nm, which belongs to the interspacing of the (0001) lattice planes of the wurtzite ZnO. These results demonstrate that the ZnO NRs grew along the [0001] direction. SAED pattern also verifies good crystalline quality of the hydrothermally grown ZnO NRs, which is in agreement with the XRD pattern. The hybrid materials of ZnS nanoparticles coating on the surface of ZnO NRs are clearly revealed in Fig. 3b, c and d. It can be seen that the ZnS nanoparticles grows lager with increasing TAA concentration, and this result is also consistent with XRD. From the HRTEM image (inset in Fig. 3b), we can see that ZnS nanoparticles (3–4 nm) are well distributed on the surface of ZnO NRs. The EDS pattern of surface layer of as-prepared ZnO/ZnS core–shell NRs is inset in Fig. 3c, which further confirms the existence of ZnS nanoparticles on the ZnO NRs. The SAED pattern (inset in Fig. 3d) demonstrated the details of the local polycrystalline structure, and the concentric rings could be assigned as diffractions from the (111), (220) and (311) planes of fcc ZnS.

To investigate the optical properties of the as-prepared ZnO/ZnS core–shell NRs and their potential application as photonic materials, their PL spectra were recorded at room temperature. For comparison, the PL spectrum of pure ZnO NRs was also obtained at the same conditions. PL spectra of the ZnO NRs and ZnO/ZnS core–shell NRs are shown in Fig. 4. The spectra are in similar profile and mainly consist of two emission bands, a sharp blue emission band centered at 471 nm and a strong, broad orange emission band centered at 621 nm. The typical UV near-band-edge emission of the ZnO NRs is not observed in our PL spectra, this absence has also been reported previously.30 Because of the existence of extrinsic and intrinsic lattice defects with different ionization states, the origin of visible PL in ZnO is still a complicated issue but widely accepted as from defects.31 According to previous reports, the blue luminescence at 471 nm may result from the surface defects on the ZnO samples.32 The orange emission may be arisen from optical transitions in the single negatively charged interstitial oxygen ion (Oi−) inside the grain.33,34 In the hydrothermal process, there are excess oxygen ions in the precursor aqueous solution, and some oxygen ions may enter into the interstitial sites of the ZnO crystal lattice and form Oi−. The orange emission is attributed to the radiative recombination of a delocalized electron close to the conduction band with a deeply trapped hole in Oi− centers.35 From the PL spectra, it can be seen that the PL intensity in the orange emission decreases obviously when the thickness of ZnS nanoparticles shell increases. It indicates that the existence of less Oi− with the increase of shell thickness. This may be explained as the decrease of ZnO surface defects with the increase of shell thickness.

Fig. 5A displays the photodegradation behaviours of RhB catalyzed by the as-prepared pure ZnO NRs and ZnO/ZnS core–shell NRs after exposure to visible light irradiation for 10 min, and the change in the concentration of RhB by different samples is plotted in the inset, which clearly show that the ZnO/ZnS core-shell hybrids can degrade RhB more effectively than ZnO NRs. The superior photocatalytic performance of these hybrid structures may be ascribed to as follow. The schematic diagram representing the charge transfer process in ZnO/ZnS hybrid structures is illustrated in Scheme 2. The conduction band of ZnS lies at a more negative potential than that of ZnO, while the valence band of ZnO is more positive than that of ZnS.36 Under visible-light irradiation, photogenerated electrons pass from the conduction band of ZnS to the corresponding band of ZnO and hole transfer occurs from the valence band of ZnO to that of ZnS. The simultaneous transfer of electrons and holes in the ZnO/ZnS system should increase both the yield and the lifetime of charge carriers, in which the photogenerated electrons can be captured by the adsorbed oxygen molecules and the holes be trapped by the surface hydroxyl, both resulting in the formation of high oxidative hydroxyl radical species (˙OH) that show little selectivity for the attack of dye molecules. Thus, the photocatalysis efficiency is significantly enhanced.

(B) The photocatalytic activities of different photocatalysts: Sa, Sd and Sf. 
It can be seen that when the concentration of TAA was less than 0.0125 M, the photoactivity was enhanced steadily with increasing amount of TAA. The improved photocatalytic performance could be ascribed to the enhanced photogenerated electron–hole separation. However, further increase in concentration of TAA (MTAA > 0.0125 mol L−1) during the microwave synthesis results in decreasing photocatalytic activity. The thicker and denser ZnS layer may have reduced the quantity of the photogenerated charges due to unfavourable morphology and also poorer charge transport through the ZnS shell. Thus, the best degradation activity for RhB is attained in sample Sd (MTAA = 0.0125 mol L−1). This indicates that, in this particular case, the structure of Sd should have the ideal ZnO/ZnS core–shell structure when the balancing of charge separation and transport is at optimal and hence demonstrate most favorable photocatalytic activity.
To further investigate the relationship of the sample's surface structures and the photocatalytic efficiency, the change in the concentration of RhB with different exposure time in the presence of the as-prepared pure ZnO NRs (Sa), Sd and Sf are shown in Fig. 5B. The complete photodegradation of RhB in the presence of pure ZnO NRs require 55 min, but the as-prepared hybrid NRs of Sd and Sf require 25 and 45 min, respectively. It also shows that the photocatalytic activity of the hybrid nanostructures first increase and then decrease with the increase of thickness of ZnS shell.
Conclusions
In summary, using ZnO NRs as a template, ZnO/ZnS core–shell NRs have been successfully fabricated via a simple microwave-assisted in situ surface sulfidation strategy. Using this process, the as-prepared hybrid structures preserved the uniformity of the initial ZnO NRs, and the thickness of the ZnS nanoparticles shell could be varied or controlled by the concentration of TAA solution during the microwave irradiation. The as-prepared ZnO/ZnS core–shell NRs exhibit narrowed band gap and strong orange luminescence at 621 nm, attributed to the interstitial oxygen ion defect introduces into ZnO obtained from a low-temperature hydrothermal growth process. Additionally, the PL intensity can be tuned by varying the thickness of ZnS shell. The fabricated functional ZnO/ZnS hybrid structures evinced a significantly higher (by 100% increase) photocatalytic activity in the degradation of RhB than that of pure ZnO NRs under the same conditions. A new paradigm for designing more active photocatalysts through such microwave irradiation method is therefore being suggested. These ZnO/ZnS core–shell NRs have possible applications in the fields of luminescence, electronics, and sensors. We believe that this rapid, facile surface sulfidation method may be applied to prepare core–shell nanostructures of other metal oxide and sulfide for a wide range of applications.
