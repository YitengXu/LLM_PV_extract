    , Accepted 3rd April 2017First published on 4th April 2017AbstractThe effect of triptycenylene end-groups on the optoelectronic properties of aroyleneimidazoles and their performance as acceptors in bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices are described. We compare three derivatives of triptycene monoaroyleneimidazoles with their planar analogues. Planar aroyleneimidazoles show rather poor performance as acceptors with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of ∼0.3–1.3%. In contrast, the triptycene end-capped congeners show improved performance with a maximum PCE of 2.3%, demonstrating the potential of triptycene-based π-systems for application as non-fullerene electron acceptors.
Perylene diimides and naphthalene diimides are well-known organic pigments and have become increasingly more attractive for organic electronics due to their high chemical, thermal and photochemical stability.1–6 Perylene diimide (PDI) and naphthalene diimide (NDI) based structures have been used as acceptors in organic photovoltaic devices (OPV) resulting in high performances7–15 and are the most promising substitutes for fullerene derivatives among other acceptor-compounds16,17. Structurally similar to PDIs and NDIs, aroyleneimidazoles are also commonly used as pigments in industry due to their high chemical, thermal and photochemical stability and a favorable absorptivity of light.18,19 They are usually synthesized through a condensation reaction of an aromatic 1,2-diamine and a naphthalene monoimide derivative, whereby an imidazole ring is formed leading to an extended π-system, resulting in an increase of the absorption spectral range.20 Similarly to PDIs and NDIs, aroyleneimidazoles are also characterized by high extinction coefficients, high electron affinities21–23 and low production costs,18,19,22 making them ideal candidates as acceptors in OPVs. Nevertheless, few literature reports exist in which aroyleneimidazoles are investigated as electron acceptors compared to PDIs or other related systems.18,19,24–26 Most intriguingly, the concept of heterojunction organic solar cells, initially developed by Tang in 1986, was based on a bilayer device consisting of an aroyleneimidazole derivative as an acceptor and copper(II) phthalocyanine as a donor arranged in a planar heterojunction (PHJ) array.27 This combination of materials has been shown to reach a power conversion efficiency of nearly 1%. Very recently, a number of planar aroyleneimidazole derivatives have been synthesized and investigated in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs with PHJ architecture resulting in high performances.28 Unlike PHJ OSCs, BHJ OSCs are fabricated by mixing the donor and acceptor compounds in solution and subsequently evaporating the solvent. Therefore appropriate solubilities of both the donor and acceptor compounds in common organic solvents are essential. We recently attached three aroyleneimidazole units to the triptycene scaffold to make soluble non-fullerene acceptors, which showed a power conversion efficiency of 3.2%.29,30 However, these rigid star-shaped aroyleneimidazole compounds cannot pack efficiently, which is on the one hand advantageous to increase the solubility, but at the same time decreases the density of π-stacking units in the resulting layer after processing, impeding charge transport through the photoactive layer. We also demonstrated that the solubility of larger aromatic fused π-systems can be increased by attaching one or two triptycenylene groups in the peripheries.31–35
Here, we explore the effect of the triptycenylene end-group and the choice of side chain on the solubilities, optoelectronic properties and photovoltaic performance of aroyleneimidazole derivatives. The synthetic routes of both the planar aroyleneimidazoles 3a–c and the triptycene end-capped congeners 6a–c are outlined in Scheme 1. The three derivatives 3a–c were obtained in yields between 37 to 86% through a one pot condensation reaction between the commercially available o-phenylenediamine 2 and naphthalene monoimides 1a–c,36,37 which were synthesized using naphthalene tetracarboxylic acid anhydride and the respective amine (see the ESI†).30

Triptycenylene end-capped aroyleneimidazoles 6a–c have been synthesized analogously to a previously described protocol,29 starting with monoamino mononitro triptycene 4,38 which is first condensed with monoimides 1a–c in quinoline at 180 °C giving triptycene naphthalene diimides 5a–c in 67–73% yields after separation by size-exclusion chromatography. Subsequently, the nitro groups have been reduced by tin(II) chloride in ethyl acetate at 85 °C to amino groups, which in situ underwent a second condensation resulting in aroyleneimidazoles 6a–c in 41–58% yields after separation. The optoelectronic properties of all aroyleneimidazoles (3a–c and 6a–c) were investigated by UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy as well as by cyclovoltammetry in dichloromethane (DCM) at room temperature and are exemplarily compared in Table 1 (see also the ESI†) (Fig. 1).

All triptycene end-capped aroyleneimidazoles 6a–c exhibit two broad absorption maxima at longer wavelengths (λ = 372 nm and 476 nm) and a strong peak at λ = 324 nm (ε = ∼3.5 × 104 M−1 cm−1). The optical bandgap of 6a–c is estimated from the absorption onset to be 2.2 eV in solution. Most interestingly, the absorption maxima of 6a–c are bathochromically shifted by about 30 nm compared to the planar aroyleneimidazoles 3a–c (Fig. 1, right). The latter exhibit an optical bandgap of 2.4 eV (λonset = 516 nm), slightly larger than for 6a–c. Moreover, the fluorescence maxima of 6a–c are bathochromically shifted by 55 nm compared to those of 3a–c, suggesting a homoconjugation of triptycene.39–41 The Stokes shift is estimated to be 144 nm (4879 cm−1) for 6a–c and 129 nm (5152 cm−1) for 3a–c. The cyclic voltammogram (Fig. 2) of planar aroyleneimidazole 3a shows two reversible reduction waves at Ered,1 = −0.90 V and Ered,2 = −1.33 V against Fc/Fc+, corresponding to the LUMO energies of ELUMO = −3.90 eV and ELUMO+1 = −3.47 eV. Similarly, the triptycene end-capped aroyleneimidazole 6a exhibits two reversible reduction waves at Ered,1 = −1.19 V and Ered,2 = −1.70 V against Fc/Fc+, corresponding to ELUMO = −3.61 eV and ELUMO+1 = −3.10 eV, thus slightly destabilized compared to 3a. Combined with the values for the optical bandgaps obtained above, the estimated HOMO position is at EHOMO = −6.30 eV for 3a and at EHOMO = −5.8 eV for 6a.

Frontier molecular orbital levels obtained from density functional theory (DFT) calculations are at ELUMO = −3.4 eV, EHOMO = −6.3 eV for 3a–c and ELUMO = −3.3 eV, EHOMO = −5.9 eV for 6a–c, thus confirming the destabilized levels for 6a–c.
As can be seen in Fig. 3, for all the derivatives the LUMO is mainly located on the naphthalene imide unit. In 3a–c the largest orbital coefficients of the HOMOs are located at the phenylene part, whereas in 6a–c these are found distributed over the entire triptycene unit, once more demonstrating the small but not negligible contribution of homoconjugation.39–41 The substituent on the imide-N seems to have no influence on the optoelectronic properties as no orbital coefficients are found at this position, which is also confirmed by the high degree of congruency of the UV-vis and fluorescence spectra for 3a–c and 6a–c.

For the optimization of bulk heterojunction solar cells it is crucial to control the donor/acceptor domain sizes, enabling excitons to reach a domain boundary within their diffusion length.42 The phase separation can be influenced by a myriad of factors including changing the acceptor molecular structure and solubility, both of which are addressed in the series of compounds presented here. Table 2 summarizes the solubility of all compounds in chloroform at room temperature. For both the aryl and the bisoctyl substituent at the imide nitrogen, the solubilities of the planar aroyleneimidazoles 3a–b and the triptycene end-capped aroyleneimidazole 6a–b are fairly comparable. While the compounds with aromatic substituents (3a, 6a) reach values around 10–12 mg mL−1, the ones with bisoctyl substituents (3b, 6b) yield the highest overall values (32–33 mg mL−1). In contrast to our expectation that the ethylhexyl and the bisoctyl moieties would result in comparable solubilities, this was only true for the triptycene end-capped aroyleneimidazole (6c) with a solubility of 20 mg mL−1, while the value for the planar aroyleneimidazole (3c) dropped down to 5 mg mL−1.

Both sets of compounds were preliminarily investigated as acceptors (A) with PTB7 (poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo-[1,2-b:4,5-b′] dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-(2-ethylhexyl)-carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thio-phenediyl]) as a donor (D) in bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic devices (inverted architecture, see the ESI†).
For optimizing the performance, several D/A ratios and layer thicknesses have been tested (see the ESI, Fig. S31 and S32 and Tables S3–S15†). Table 2 summarizes the photovoltaic parameters for the best performing conditions for each compound, Fig. 4 shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and J–V characteristic of the corresponding devices measured under AM1.5.

At first glance, 3a–c and 6a–c show comparable behavior regarding the influence of the imide substituents. For both the planar aroyleneimidazoles 3b–c and the triptycene end-capped aroyleneimidazoles 6b–c with bisoctyl and ethylhexyl substituents, the performance is considerably lower than for the aryl substituents, thus showing a similar trend. The latter ones yielded the highest efficiencies with 1.2 ± 0.1% for 3a and 2.2 ± 0.1% for 6a. Interestingly, a high solubility as in the case for 3b and 6b proved to be detrimental, with efficiencies of 0.2 ± 0.1% and 0.8 ± 0.1%, respectively. Therefore, high solubility does not ensure good device performance and might be even disadvantageous. Nonetheless, the differences in solubility cannot explain the results to a full extent. Obviously there is a trade-off when adding substituents between structural changes and changes in solubility. As in the case of the derivatives with aryl substituents, the relative stiffness of the molecules seems to be beneficial for the OPV device performance.
Interestingly, we observe a different relation between the active layer thickness and photovoltaic performance between 3a–c and 6a–c derivatives (Fig. S31†). It is known that one-fold triptycenylene end-capped extended π-systems show a stronger directionality in the formation of π-stacks compared to the corresponding planar compounds,43 which could explain the better performance of 6a–c in comparison with 3a–c and the difference in the optimal active layer thickness.
More detailed studies on these systems are necessary to give further insight into the structure–property relationships of non-fullerene acceptors based on aroyleneimidazoles to further improve their solar cell efficiencies. These aspects are currently under investigation and will be reported in due course.
