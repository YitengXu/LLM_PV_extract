    , Accepted 6th January 2017First published on 6th January 2017AbstractHematite (α-Fe2O3) is an attractive candidate for photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen generation by oxidation of water due to its low cost, earth-abundance and appropriate bandgap. However, large scale production of hematite thin films with efficient PEC performance is a challenging problem in the field. In this article, based on an electron beam evaporation method, we provide a scalable route for preparation of a Co–Pi modified hematite thin film with efficient solar water oxidation properties. To our knowledge, no work has been done on photoelectrochemical characterization of Co–Pi modified hematite films prepared based on electron beam evaporation. We show that by optimization of deposition conditions including the film thickness and annealing temperature and performing the deposition in an oxygen medium, an efficient PEC performance is achieved from the produced pristine hematite photoanode. By various characterizations including XRD, EDX, SEM, transient photocurrent and I–V measurements, and impedance spectroscopy, it is shown that the efficient performance is attributed to the improved crystalline structure and suppression of recombination centres originated from the defects in bulk and surface of the hematite layer. Also with deposition of different thicknesses of Co–Pi electro-catalysts on the hematite layer, the optimum structure for fast water oxidation and charge transfer kinetics across the interface of the photoanode and electrolyte is obtained. The most efficient photoanode delivers up to 1.5 (mA cm−2) at the potential of 1.5 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is among the large value photocurrents attained from a hematite-based photoanode, but with the advantage of large scale production capability of the proposed method of this work.
Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting uses semiconductors to store the energy of the sun in the chemical bonds of hydrogen. The hydrogen later can be transformed into higher density fuels such as methanol or formic acid by reacting with carbon dioxide.1–6 Thus, widespread research studies have been recently conducted to develop low-cost hydrogen generation methods driven by solar energy. After the first report by Fujishima and Honda on single crystal TiO2 electrodes,1 extensive studies have been carried out in the development of semiconductor material photoanodes for solar driven fuel generation. To achieve solar to hydrogen conversion efficiency beyond 10%, the semiconductor needs to have significant optical absorption in the visible region. This has motivated research activities on developing efficient hematite,5,7–13 bismuth vanadate,14–16 nitride,17,18 and oxy-nitride19,20 photoanodes for water oxidation.
Among these materials, hematite (α-Fe2O3) is an appealing candidate because of its abundance in the earth's crust at low cost and its chemical stability.11,21 However, its poor electronic transport properties including low mobility (μelectron = 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1) and short hole diffusion length (ldiffusion = 2–4 nm (ref. 22 and 23) or 20 nm (ref. 24)) and also slow charge transfer kinetics have so far hindered full exploration of hematite for water oxidation. The light penetration depth of hematite is on the order of 100 nm at visible wavelengths.25 Therefore, a significant portion of charge carriers are generated relatively far from the semiconductor/electrolyte interface and cannot contribute to the water oxidation reaction.26 This usually has been addressed either using highly porous hematite structures27–29 or using extremely thin films of hematite deposited on a conductive nanostructured scaffold.30,31 Nevertheless, addition of doping materials has been extensively explored to prolong the hole diffusion distance of hematite.32–35
In the past few years, there has been a lot of interest in using physical vapor depositions (PVDs) such as sputtering36–38 or electron beam evaporation (EBE)39–41 for the synthesis of hematite and other water oxidation photoanodes.42,43 The reason is that these processes have the potential of industrialization bringing a step closer to realization of large area water oxidation photoanodes. It should be mentioned that the atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD)44–46 already used for the synthesis of the so-called cauliflower hematite photoanodes has the potential of scaling; up however it has not been demonstrated in the context of water oxidation yet. Atomic layer deposition (ALD)47,48 is also an industrially viable technique; however it still suffers from the extremely low growth rate that makes it not appealing for deposition of layers thicker than 10 nm.
The goal of this work is to propose an optimized method for large scale production of a Co–Pi modified hematite thin film with efficient PEC water oxidation properties. Although recent efforts have made significant progress in production of Co–Pi/hematite hetero-junctions, modification of hematite films prepared by PVD methods is unexplored in the literature. In this work, hematite films are deposited on a conductive transparent substrate by evaporating Fe metal under an O2 environment followed by an annealing procedure. Evaporation conditions along with the subsequent annealing are thoroughly optimized to obtain the most efficient bare hematite photoanode. Subsequently, we optimize the deposition of a Co–Pi co-catalyst layer on the hematite film using the photo-assisted electrodeposition method.49 We demonstrate that loading perfectly crystalline mesoporous Co–Pi nanostructures on the hematite thin film leads to a remarkable drop of the onset potential required for water oxidation up to 185 mV. The most efficient photoanode delivers up to 1.5 (mA cm−2) at the potential of 1.5 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) which is among the highest photocurrents achieved from a hematite layer synthesized by a PVD method. Photoelectrochemical and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements indicate that the efficient performance is attributed to suppression of defects in the hematite film structure. Also, the improvement of charge transfer kinetics by Co–Pi modification is related to facilitation of hole transport at the interface of the photoanode with the electrolyte.
Experimental section
α-Fe2O3 thin films are prepared using a home-built electron-beam evaporator by evaporating Fe metal under an O2 environment onto fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates. The FTO substrates (3.2 mm thick, 8 Ω sq−1) are cut into sizes of 1 cm × 1 cm and are cleaned ultrasonically in deionized (DI) water, acetone and ethanol respectively for 15 min and are dried with N2 flow at the end. Prior to the deposition, the chamber is evacuated around the pressure 2 × 10−6 Torr. During the deposition, the pressure is maintained to be about 1.5 × 10−5 Torr. The deposition rate and the deposited thickness are controlled by using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). The deposition rate is kept at 0.5 (nm s−1) and the distance between the source and the substrate is set to be around 55 cm. After deposition, the samples are annealed in air at three different temperatures including 450, 525 and 600 °C for 4 h in order to optimize the annealing effect. During the annealing, the heating rate is set to the constant value of 5 °C per minute and the samples are allowed to cool naturally after annealing.
For surface modification of α-Fe2O3 thin films, the Co–Pi co-catalyst is deposited onto α-Fe2O3 photoanodes by photo-assisted electrodeposition under light illumination by a xenon lamp through the FTO side. All Co–Pi depositions are carried out in a three-electrode cell at a constant voltage of V = 0.9 vs. Ag/AgCl inside a solution of 0.5 mM cobalt nitrate and 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7. A Pt wire is used as the counter electrode, and saturated Ag/AgCl is used as the reference electrode. Co–Pi is electrodeposited on the α-Fe2O3 thin film set as the working electrode and the thickness of the deposited film is controlled by varying the duration of deposition. Typically, the current density during the deposition is about 540 (μA cm−2) (see Fig. S1†).
Photoelectrochemical tests of each sample are conducted using an Eco Chemie-Autolab potentiostat combined with a three-electrode photoelectrochemical cell with Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode and Pt wire as the counter electrode. The photoanode as the working electrode is immersed in 1 M NaOH (pH = 13) electrolyte and is illuminated using an unfiltered 300 W xenon lamp (Oriel) through the FTO side for the backward illumination of the hematite layer. The measured potentials vs. the Ag/AgCl reference can be converted to that of the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) reference using the Nernst equation as ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.0591(pH) + 0.1976 V. The potential of the hematite photoanodes is swept at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 from cathodic to anodic potentials. The xenon lamp (300 W) as a light similar to the solar spectrum in the visible region (400–700 nm) with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (the AM1.5 standard) was used by adjusting the lamp intensity using a standard solar cell and a lux-meter and assuming the photocurrent in the solar cell is linear with the illumination power. The spectrum of the xenon lamp is shown in Fig. S2.† Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements are conducted with an AC component amplitude of 10 mV in the range of 100 mHz to 200 kHz. The crystal structure of the films is determined by X-ray diffractometry using a (Philips X'Pert MPD) diffractometer with a CuKα X-ray source (λ = 1.5405980 Å). Optical absorption measurements of the films are performed using a UV-visible absorption spectrometer (Photonix Ar 2015). The surface morphology of samples and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyses are obtained using a high-resolution field emission scanning electron microscope (LEO 1530 from Zeiss) equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer.
Results and discussion
Structural characterizations of FESEM images are presented to investigate the morphology of the α-Fe2O3 thin film and α-Fe2O3/Co–Pi samples. Fig. 1a and b show top and cross-views of α-Fe2O3 thin film with a thickness of 175 nm deposited on FTO. As seen from the top view images (Fig. 1a), the hematite thin film completely covers the surface of the FTO substrate with highly compacted nanostructures. This dense film consists of large globular clusters stacked over each other. Each cluster is composed of smaller grains. The cross-section FESEM image in Fig. 1b demonstrates that the hematite film forms continuous coatings on the FTO substrate. High resolution SEM images show that the annealing has no substantial influence on the morphology of the hematite nanostructures (see Fig. S3†).

As seen from the cross- and top view images, the hematite and Co–Pi/hematite thin films completely cover the surface of the FTO substrate with highly compacted nanostructures. 

Fig. 1c and d show representative top and cross-views of FESEM images of the resulting Co–Pi/α-Fe2O3 composite photoanode which consists of a hematite thin film of 175 nm thickness modified with the Co–Pi co-catalyst after 5 min photo-electrodeposition. The SEM images of the layer taken right after Co–Pi deposition reveal cabbage shape patterns grown on the surface of hematite. This Co–Pi layer causes the reddish orange color of the hematite film changes to a gloomier color (Fig. S4†). From the cross-section view of the sample in Fig. 1d, the thickness of the Co–Pi layer is estimated to be about 130 nm (see also images of Fig. S5†). These results indicate that the Co–Pi treatment by the photo-electrodeposition consistently covers the hematite film by a suitable thickness.

Fig. 2a shows the optical absorption spectra of the hematite films revealing that the absorption increases with the film thickness. There are two absorption transitions at the wavelengths around 540 and 400 nm which have been assigned to characteristic indirect and direct transitions of the hematite films, respectively.50 As shown in Fig. 2b for the Tauc plot of a hematite thin film, drawing tangential lines to each curve at the beginning point of absorption edge indicates an indirect bandgap with the value of about 2.1 eV for all of the samples, consistent with reported values for hematite.9,38

Based on various reference cards, the peaks of different materials observed in the XRD analyses are indicated by different symbols; (d) EDX spectra for Co–Pi modified hematite film. The table of EDX percentage results is also shown in the inset for more clarification. 
The XRD patterns of bare and Co–Pi deposited hematite thin films are shown in Fig. 2c. In the case of bare hematite (red curve), the peaks of (110), (104), (113), (102) and (024) all clearly indicate the formation of α-Fe2O3 on the substrate. Also the peaks of FTO are identified in the XRD pattern. Between the various peaks of α-Fe2O3, the peak of (110) has the highest intensity indicating that the growth along this plane is dominant. We should point out that the conductivity of hematite is higher along the direction [110] relative to other directions.41 The dominant growth of the hematite thin film along the plane (110) is a good signature for achieving good conductivity in the synthesized hematite photoanodes. Using Scherer's equation, a mean crystallite size of about 45 nm is calculated from the broadening of the peak (110).
As shown in the XRD pattern of the Co–Pi modified hematite sample (green curve in Fig. 2c), various peaks are well indexed to verify formation of different Co–Pi based crystal components including those of Co3(PO4)2, P2O5, CoO, Fe(PO3)2 and Co3Fe4(PO4)6. It should be mentioned that remarkable electro-catalytic activities from some of these Co–Pi based composite species have been reported in the literature.51–56 The mesoporous crystalline Co–Pi deposited on the hematite film in this work has strong potential for water oxidation activity due to the existence of the aforementioned electro-catalytic materials in its structure. In addition to XRD measurements, the EDX spectrum shown in Fig. 2d confirms the coverage of the Co–Pi co-catalyst on the surface of the hematite thin film.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
In order to study the effect of the film thickness on the photoelectrochemical performance, photocurrent measurements are carried out on a number of bare hematite films with different thicknesses which are annealed at the temperature of 600 °C. Fig. 3a shows the results of current–potential curves in the dark and backside illumination of the samples (illumination from the FTO side). As a general trend, photocurrent increases for all films with increasing the bias voltage. The onset potential for different samples is in the range of 0.8–0.82VRHE, which is comparable to the values obtained in the other PVD work.41 This almost invariant onset potential shows that the kinetics of water oxidation at the surface of various hematite films are similar. As shown in Fig. 3, the photocurrent monotonically increases with the thickness of α-Fe2O3 for the range of thickness between 70 and 175 nm. This originates from increment of the hematite material deposited on the substrate which results in more absorption of the light by the sample. By further increment of the film thickness, the effects of grain boundaries and recombination centers inside the bulk material become more important than the amount of deposited hematite and this increases the recombination losses of the photoanode causing a reduction in the photocurrent. Therefore, based on the examined thicknesses, the optimum film for acquiring maximum current is that of 175 nm (Fig. 3b). The PEC measurement was repeated for various samples in later times for checking the stability of the results and no considerable difference in the response of a sample was seen even after passing several months.

To investigate the sensitivity of PEC performance to annealing temperature, hematite films with a thickness of 175 nm are annealed at three different temperatures. As shown in Fig. 4a, significant enhancement in photocurrent is achieved as the annealing temperature increases from 450 °C to 525 °C and 600 °C. The increment of photoactivity of the hematite film with annealing temperature is related to the improvement of the crystalline structure and reduction of defects at the FTO/hematite interface as well as in the bulk and surface of hematite.33,57 These defects are the main causes of recombination in the hematite film (Fig. 4c and d). Moreover, high annealing temperature results in diffusion of Sn from the FTO substrate to hematite bulk which causes improved conductivity in hematite.57,58 For higher temperatures than 600 °C, the FTO substrate becomes an insulator because of thermal degradation of fluorine doped SnO2. XRD patterns of the samples annealed at higher temperature show a narrower peak at the [110] direction (Fig. S6†), which indicates that the crystalline quality improves by increasing the annealing temperature from 450 °C to 600 °C.

Green arrows indicate desirable processes. Red arrows, instead, denote unwanted processes. The thickness of the arrows indicates the relative importance of the recombination processes in the hematite photoanode. 

Fig. 4b shows typical photocurrent transients of the 175 nm thick hematite film annealed at different temperatures. The transient photocurrent of the films annealed at 450 °C and 525 °C shows an intense increase in the photocurrent after turning on the light, followed by a slow decay until the photocurrent stabilizes at a constant value. The transient response of the hematite film annealed at 600 °C shows a sharp spike when turning on the light. Moreover, they also show a cathodic spike when the light is turned off, something that was not observed for the samples annealed at 450 and 525 °C. These anodic/cathodic spike-shape transients for the sample of 600 °C are a characteristic signature of hole accumulation at the interface of the photoanode with the electrolyte.18,59 In this case, the rate of photogenerated holes reaching the photoanode/electrolyte interface is more than the rate at which the holes are participated in electrochemical reactions at the surface. The higher steady state photocurrent and faster photo-response transients of the 600 °C annealed hematite are attributed to a smaller concentration of defects in the bulk structure of hematite films. In fact, higher annealing temperature results in lower defect concentrations, larger grain sizes, and improved PEC performance.
The FTO substrates in our work are from SIGMA-ALDRICH. The FTO substrates can typically support high annealing temperatures up to 800 °C. We also measured a typical resistivity of the FTOs annealed at the temperatures of 450, 525, 600, and 675 °C as 18, 31, 46 and 88 Ω, respectively. This clearly indicates their high temperature durability.
The oxygen flowing during PVD deposition affects bulk defects and surface states at the interface of hematite/electrolyte because of its influence on oxygen deficiencies.60 To investigate this aspect, we compared the PEC performances of two samples, one prepared in oxygen flow during the deposition and one without oxygen flowing. Fig. 5 shows the photocurrent transient response of these samples (see also photocurrent vs. voltage curve of Fig. S7†). The hematite film prepared with O2 gas yields a photocurrent density of 0.36 mA cm−2 at V = 1.23 RHE, which is 2 times higher than that prepared without O2. This improved PEC performance can be explained by lower bulk defects and also passivation of the interface trap states at the hematite surface, which results in a faster transient photo-response and improved oxidation kinetics.

After optimization of the hematite thickness and the annealing temperature, the best hematite photoanode is chosen to investigate the Co–Pi co-catalyst effect on water oxidation improvement. The thickness of the Co–Pi co-catalyst is controlled with adjusting the time of its deposition in the photo-electro-deposition process. Fig. 6 compares the current–voltage curves of various bare and Co–Pi modified hematite samples under 100 mW cm−2 light illumination from the substrate side. As shown in Fig. 6, the photocurrent of the bare hematite remarkably increases with Co–Pi modification. Also, the photocurrent increases with Co–Pi thickness until reaching an optimum thickness (which is attributed to 5 min photo-electro-deposition). Further increase of the Co–Pi thickness beyond the optimized amount decreases photocurrent generation. As shown in Fig. 6, with deposition of 5 min Co–Pi co-catalyst which corresponds to the thickness of about 130 nm (according to cross SEM images in Fig. 1), the photocurrent of bare hematite sample increases from 1.08 mA cm−2 to about 1.5 mA cm−2 at 1.5 V vs. RHE (see Fig. 6b). This value seems to be the highest photocurrent achieved from a hematite photoanode prepared by various physical vapor deposition methods (see also cyclic voltammetry measurements in Fig. S8†).
 Fig. 6  PEC measurements of various samples with 175 nm α-Fe2O3 and different thicknesses of Co–Pi co-catalyst on it. The thickness of Co–Pi is controlled by the time of photo-electro-deposition in 1 M NaOH electrolyte (pH = 13). Accordingly, the different Co–Pi thickness samples are named as 1 min, 3 min, 5 min, 7 min, 10 min and 30 min. The bare hematite sample in this figure is identified by 0 min. (a) Linear sweep voltammetry (i–v curves) under 100 mW cm−2 light illumination at the scan rate of 50 mV s−1, (b) the photocurrent of Co–Pi-modified hematite photoanode recorded at two voltages of V = 1.23 V and 1.5 V (vs. RHE) as a function of Co–Pi deposition time. (c) Onset potential shift of the different Co–Pi deposited photoanodes relative to the bare photoanode. 

Fig. 6c shows variations of the cathodic shift (difference of onset potentials of various Co–Pi modified films relative to that of the bare hematite) as a function of Co–Pi deposition time. Like the amount of photocurrent generation, the shift in photocurrent onset potential has an optimized Co–Pi thickness. At the optimum of Co–Pi thickness, the photocurrent generation is considerably facilitated with starting at the low overpotential of 0.625 V (vs. RHE). Appearance of the optimum Co–Pi thickness here is consistent with other reports examining Co–Pi on various semiconductor layers including TiO2,61 BiVO4 (ref. 62) and Fe2O3.63 It should be mentioned that the negative effect of high Co–Pi thicknesses on the hematite PEC performance seems to originate from weak hole transfer properties of the Co–Pi layer.
Basically, the oxygen evolution at the photoanode surface is the main bottleneck restricting the overall water oxidation reaction of bare hematite.5,63,64 The large overpotential demanding oxygen evolution in hematite has been attributed to slow kinetic reactions and poor charge transfer from the photoanode to electrolyte.65,66 Therefore, an efficient oxygen evolution co-catalyst such as Co–Pi enhances the charge transfer rates and decreases the associated overpotential. As shown in Fig. 6c, the external bias needed to drive water oxidation in bare hematite decreases more than 185 mV after the Co–Pi modification, which is accompanied by reduction of electron–hole recombination.
For better analyzing the PEC performance of photoanodes, chronoamperometry (photocurrent density vs. time) measurements are carried out at different applied bias potentials. Fig. 7a and b display the photocurrent responses of various hematite samples for two different bias voltages. The light on/off (anodic/cathodic) transient responses of the photocurrent for the low bias potential of 1.115 V (vs. RHE) are shown in two short time intervals for a better comparison. The anodic transients corresponding to a short time after turning on the light include spike-shape photocurrents which mainly attribute to the accumulation of holes at the photoanode/electrolyte interface. Similarly, the cathodic transient upon turning off the light represents recombination of electrons from the conduction band with the holes of the valence band causing reduction of the photocurrent. According to the results in Fig. 7a, for the bare hematite photoanode (0 min) at the low bias potential of 1.115 V, both of the anodic and cathodic transient behaviors include noticeable spikes. These spikes are gradually diminished with increasing the bias potential and the photocurrent responses become more stepwise as shown in Fig. 7b. In fact, at the higher potential of 1.565 V, the charge barrier at the interface of hematite/electrolyte no longer prevents the transfer of holes to the electrolyte and therefore nearly all of the holes reaching the surface participate in the water oxidation reaction.
 Fig. 7  Chronoamperometry transient photocurrent densities measured at (a) V = 1.115 V and (b) V = 1.565 V (vs. RHE). Magnified portions in graph (a) show the current-responses under chopped illumination for better comparison. (c) J–V curves for bare and Co–Pi modified (5 min deposition) hematite photoanodes measured under 100 mW cm−2 xenon lamp illuminations for both chopped and constant light. 
In Fig. 7c, the J–V curves are recorded under light chopping conditions and compared with those of the constant illumination. Comparing the chopped light curve with the steady state J–V curve indicates that at low potentials, the transient spike-like behavior is remarkable in the results of both bare and Co–Pi modified hematite layers. For the bare hematite, the transient spikes are much sharper than those of Co–Pi deposited layers. The sharp spikes in the bare hematite strongly indicate fast recombination of photogenerated pairs of electron–holes. For the Co–Pi deposited hematite, the recombination is slow and decay of currents to the steady-state values takes longer times. This mainly originates from the fast transport of the photo-generated holes from the valence band of hematite to the electrolyte conducted by the Co–Pi layer. At high enough bias voltages, the transient behavior gradually diminishes for both bare and Co–Pi doped hematite layers and we see no considerable difference between the steady-state and the chopping photocurrents.
Due to the sluggish hole transport of the bare hematite photoanode, the water oxidation rate at the interface of the semiconductor/electrolyte is slow enough and the photogenerated holes reaching the interface accumulate at the photoanode surface. These accumulated holes act as a charge barrier layer for subsequent holes reaching the interface. Consequently, in order to overcome this barrier, an anodic overpotential is required for photocurrent generation in the cell. At low applied potentials, a significant competition takes place between recombination of the accumulated holes at the interface and the consumption of these holes due to water oxidation. However, high enough bias voltages, the recombination is diminished due to the fast transfer of holes to the electrolyte and therefore nearly all of the holes reaching the surface participate in the water oxidation.
One way for better demonstrating the role of Co–Pi in facilitating hole injection to the electrolyte is addition of H2O2 to the electrolyte. Since H2O2 has lower oxidation potential than H2O, adding H2O2 to the electrolyte should lead to improvement of the photocurrent.67
Fig. S9† shows the result of photocurrent measurement of bare hematite films under addition of 0.5 M H2O2 into the NaOH electrolyte. As shown in Fig. S9a,† without H2O2 scavenger, the onset potential is about 0.810 V (vs. RHE) for the bare hematite photoanode. But with H2O2 in the electrolyte the onset potential shifts cathodically down to 0.235 V, indicating more injection of photogenerated holes to the electrolyte. As shown in Fig. S9b,† the square transient photocurrent response of the bare hematite in the H2O2/NaOH electrolyte is consistent with easier transport of holes from the photoanode to the electrolyte in the H2O2 solvent relative to that of NaOH solvent.
The photocurrent stabilities of both bare and 5 min Co–Pi deposited hematite photoanodes are also presented in Fig. S10† for 20 hours of continuous light illumination. The figure indicates excellent stability of PEC performance for both bare and Co–Pi/hematite photoanodes.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement
The influence of Co–Pi modification on the charge transport kinetics and the interfacial properties is further investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), which is a useful tool for interpretation of PEC results.68Fig. 8 shows the Nyquist plots (real vs. imaginary impedances) of bare and Co–Pi modified α-Fe2O3 photoanodes under 100 mW cm−2 light illumination (Fig. 8a), and dark conditions (Fig. 8b), for bias voltage of V = 0.965 V (vs. RHE). The equivalent circuits used to interpret the EIS results are shown in Fig. 8c, in which the “General circuit” is used to fit the EIS data of the light illumination case with two semicircles and the “Randle circuit” is used to fit the data of the dark condition. In the proposed equivalent circuit, Rs indicates a serial resistance between FTO and bulk hematite and Rtrap indicates a resistance due to accumulation and trapping of charges in the hematite layer. Also, Rss demonstrates the resistance of charge transfer between the catalytic surface states to the electrolyte. The capacitances Cbulk and Css are related to the space charge capacitance of the bulk hematite and the capacitance associated with the surface states, respectively. From proper fitting of the EIS data with the aforementioned equivalent circuits, the appropriate resistances and capacitances are obtained from best fit. The fitting parameters obtained from EIS results in Fig. 8a are shown in Table 1.

For the light illumination case, two semicircles are clearly observed for both bare and Co–Pi modified photoanodes at the voltage V = 0.965 V (vs. RHE). The first semicircle is associated with the recombination of photogenerated charges in the bulk materials and the second semicircle is attributed to the surface states of the photoelectrodes. It is observed that the curve of the Co–Pi modified photoanode has a smaller radius than that of the bare one indicating that rapid charge transfer kinetics occurs by the surface modification of hematite with Co–Pi.
In order to investigate hole transfer kinetics at the photoanode/electrolyte interface, we carried out EIS measurements for Co–Pi modified hematite films with different thicknesses. Fig. 8d shows the variation of charge transfer resistance, Rss with respect to time of Co–Pi deposition at the bias voltage of V = 0.965 V (vs. RHE) for various Co–Pi modified hematite films. As shown, the charge transfer resistance of the bare photoanode is higher than those of various Co–Pi deposited photoanodes. The trend of Rss variation with the Co–Pi deposition time is in accordance with the electrochemical measurement results in Fig. 6. The α-Fe2O3 film with 5 min Co–Pi deposition shows the best PEC performance in the electrochemical measurements and the lowest Rss in the EIS results.
From the results of Table 1, the value of Rss associated with the second semicircle of Fig. 8a is considerably lower (about one third) for the Co–Pi modified hematite in comparison with that of the bare hematite. The same scenario is also seen for the charge trapping resistance (Rtrap) after surface modification of hematite with Co–Pi. This EIS result completely agrees with acceleration of surface water oxidation in the presence of the Co–Pi co-catalyst. The effect of Co–Pi modification can also be discussed from the change of Css in the EIS analysis. Because Css is related to the capacity of the interface to accumulate more charges at the photoanode surface, then by modification of hematite with Co–Pi, Css considerably increases which indicates that easier charge transfer occurs from the photoanode to the electrolyte.

Fig. 9a shows Nyquist plots of hematite photoanodes with a thickness of 175 nm, annealed at different temperatures of 450 °C and 600 °C, under the illumination conditions. It is seen that the charge transfer resistance decreases with increasing the annealing temperature, where the radius of the Nyquist arcs decreases by the annealing temperature. This reduced charge transfer resistance results in improvement of PEC performance as indicated by I–V measurements in Fig. 4. The improvement in electrical contact between the FTO substrate and hematite film can also be deduced from the reduced value of the charge transport resistance at the FTO/hematite interface, Rs, which changes from the 142 Ω cm−2 at T = 450 °C to 34 Ω cm−2 at 600 °C.
 Fig. 9  (a) Nyquist plots of hematite films of thickness 175 nm annealed at two different temperatures using 1 M NaOH under illumination conditions; (b) Nyquist plots of hematite films of thickness 150 nm prepared with or without O2 flow during film evaporation using 1 M NaOH under illumination conditions. 
The improvement in PEC performance of hematite photoanodes prepared under an O2 environment relative to that of without O2 flowing can be demonstrated in the EIS measurements. Fig. 9b shows Nyquist plots of EIS measurements for hematite films of 150 nm thickness prepared with or without O2 flowing during the preparation. We see that the charge transport resistance is drastically reduced after preparation of hematite films in the O2 environment, which is in complete agreement with results of Fig. 5.
Based on the electrochemical and impedance spectroscopy results of this work, Co–Pi modification with an optimized thickness causes remarkable PEC performance improvement of hematite films prepared by a PVD method which is a promising step in the industrialization of water oxidation. Many reports have focused on studying the mechanisms by which Co–Pi surface modification enhances the photoanode performance. Several studies have suggested that cathodic shift of the onset potential and increase in photocurrent generation after Co–Pi modification are attributed to the direct catalytic participation of the Co–Pi layer in the oxygen evolution reactions.61,63,65,66 On the other hand, some detailed reports have revealed that photoactivity enhancement of the α-Fe2O3/Co–Pi photoanode is associated with changes in band bending,69,70 surface passivation71,72 and retardation of charge recombination62,73 effects. Here, we provide an interpretation of our results based on the proposed catalytic role of Co–Pi in the hematite light absorber.
The role of Co–Pi modification in improvement of PEC performance of the hematite films is schematically shown in Fig. 10, in which the photogenerated holes in the α-Fe2O3 film are transferred via the Co–Pi co-catalyst and participate in the O2 evolution. Upon light absorption and electron–hole generation in the hematite film, electrons must be transported to the FTO back contact and enter the external circuit to participate in reduction of H2O at the Pt cathode surface and subsequent H2 generation. Some part of photocurrent density is lost due to the bulk recombination in hematite shown by Jb-rec. On the other hand, the photogenerated holes must be transported to the semiconductor/electrolyte interface with sufficient efficiency to drive the oxygen evolution reaction at the surface of the photoanode. Because of the slow kinetics of water oxidation at the hematite film surface, a relatively slow hole transfer occurs across the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. This results in hole accumulation near the surface increasing the recombination between these holes and the electrons of the hematite conduction band shown by Js-rec in the scheme. For the bare hematite photoanode, there is a significant kinetic competition between water oxidation and surface recombination and this effectively restricts the PEC performance. Therefore, it is particularly interesting to investigate modification of the hematite film in a way that overcomes this slow kinetic activity with suppression of the surface recombination. The Co–Pi layer deposited at the hematite film surface acts as a co-catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction by capturing the photogenerated holes from the valence band of hematite. Highly active Co–Pi species trap the photogenerated holes and accelerate the H2O oxidation through the cyclical reactions shown in Fig. 10b. In the process, the Co2+ species accept holes from the valence band of α-Fe2O3 and then are oxidized to Co3+.63,74 These Co species can be further oxidized to Co4+ by taking another hole from the excited α-Fe2O3. The resulting Co4+ species are highly active and can efficiently oxidize water to generate O2. After the reaction with water, the cobalt species return to their original valence state. Therefore, the presence of Co–Pi effectively facilitates the hole transfer from hematite to the electrolyte and improves the overall PEC performance by suppressing the recombination.
 Fig. 10  Schematic representation of charge carrier dynamics in water oxidation in bare (left) and Co–Pi modified (right) hematite thin films. 
Based on the scheme in Fig. 10, photocurrent transient behavior of the Co–Pi deposited hematite film in Fig. 7 is analogous to that of bare hematite, in which the decaying time in the photocurrent transient of Co–Pi/α-Fe2O3 photoanodes is scaled with Co–Pi thickness. The process is mainly ascribed to the oxidation of the Co–Pi co-catalyst. After turning on the light, diffusion of photogenerated holes in the valence band of the hematite film oxidizes Co2+ in the Co–Pi co-catalyst to produce Co4+ and this results in a spike in the transient photocurrent. The cathodic transient observed after turning the light off is attributed to the reduction of Co4+ to Co2+ by electrons from the conduction band of the hematite. It is clear that the thicker Co–Pi co-catalyst requires a longer time to oxidize all Co2+. Similarly, reduction of the stored Co4+ active sites to Co2+ takes longer time for higher thicknesses of Co–Pi. Accordingly, the longer decaying times in photocurrent transient of higher thicknesses of Co–Pi on α-Fe2O3 photoanodes are completely justified.
At a given applied bias it is expected that changing the Co–Pi thickness would change the concentration of active catalytic species. This suggests that the PEC performance of Co–Pi modified hematite films is governed by the amount of deposited Co–Pi. In the experiments, we observed existence of an optimum Co–Pi thickness for getting best PEC performance (see Fig. 6). In fact, a satisfactory explanation for depression of photocurrent generation for a thicker Co–Pi co-catalyst beyond the optimized thickness can be assigned to catalytic intermediate species which thermodynamically hinder facile hole transfer kinetics through the Co–Pi layer.61,74 This explanation is in agreement with observed electrochemical and impedance spectroscopic results of our report.
It should be mentioned that according to the XRD patterns in Fig. 2, during the electrodeposition of Co–Pi some other crystalline species are formed on the hematite substrates like P2O5, CoO, Fe(PO3)2 and Co3Fe4(PO4)6. As shown in Fig. 10, only the ions of Co2+, Co3+, and Co4+ can cooperate in the cocatalyst mechanism and consequently the components which have these ions can take part in the catalyst scenario and the other components have no cocatalyst role.
Conclusion
This study demonstrates improvements in the photoelectrochemical performances of Co–Pi modified hematite photoanodes by monitoring and elimination of charge transport limitations. We show that by suitable modification of hematite thin films with the Co–Pi co-catalyst, the problem of slow water oxidation and the poor photogenerated hole transfer from hematite to the electrolyte can efficiently be resolved and thereby water oxidation efficiency of hematite can considerably be improved. Hematite thin films are prepared using a custom designed electron-beam evaporator by evaporating Fe metal under an O2 environment onto the FTO substrate followed by post-annealing in air. After optimization of the hematite film deposition for achieving the best PEC performance, we investigated deposition of a Co–Pi co-catalyst layer on the hematite films using the photo-assisted electrodeposition method. We demonstrated that 5 minutes of Co–Pi deposition leads to about 185 mV negative shift of the onset potential in addition to a dramatic increase in the photocurrent density.
The improved photocatalytic activity of hematite after Co–Pi deposition is studied using photoelectrochemical measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The Co–Pi layer deposited on the hematite film acts as a co-catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction by capturing the photogenerated holes from the valence band of hematite. Highly active Co–Pi species trap the photogenerated holes and accelerate the H2O oxidation and improve the overall PEC performance by suppressing the charge recombination. Five minute of Co–Pi co-catalyst electrodeposition on the surface of hematite increases the photocurrent density from 1 (mA cm−2) up to 1.52 (mA cm−2) at the overpotential of 1.5 V (vs. RHE), which is the highest photocurrent attained from the hematite photoanodes synthesized by a physical vapor deposition method. Our work in summary proposes a scalable approach to prepare high performance photoanodes for solar water oxidation based on hematite films modified with the Co–Pi co-catalyst.

 	Fig. 6  PEC measurements of various samples with 175 nm α-Fe2O3 and different thicknesses of Co–Pi co-catalyst on it. The thickness of Co–Pi is controlled by the time of photo-electro-deposition in 1 M NaOH electrolyte (pH = 13). Accordingly, the different Co–Pi thickness samples are named as 1 min, 3 min, 5 min, 7 min, 10 min and 30 min. The bare hematite sample in this figure is identified by 0 min. (a) Linear sweep voltammetry (i–v curves) under 100 mW cm−2 light illumination at the scan rate of 50 mV s−1, (b) the photocurrent of Co–Pi-modified hematite photoanode recorded at two voltages of V = 1.23 V and 1.5 V (vs. RHE) as a function of Co–Pi deposition time. (c) Onset potential shift of the different Co–Pi deposited photoanodes relative to the bare photoanode.	 

 	Fig. 7  Chronoamperometry transient photocurrent densities measured at (a) V = 1.115 V and (b) V = 1.565 V (vs. RHE). Magnified portions in graph (a) show the current-responses under chopped illumination for better comparison. (c) J–V curves for bare and Co–Pi modified (5 min deposition) hematite photoanodes measured under 100 mW cm−2 xenon lamp illuminations for both chopped and constant light.	 

 	Fig. 8  Nyquist plots measured under illumination (a), and dark conditions (b), for the α-Fe2O3 bare photoanode and Co–Pi/α-Fe2O3 photoanode at V = 0.965 V (vs. RHE). Discrete symbols and the solid line curves represent the experimental data and the results of fitting, respectively. (c) Equivalent circuits for EIS data fitting for both illumination (general circuit) and dark (Randle circuit) cases. (d) Variation of charge transfer resistance, Rss with respect to Co–Pi deposition time at V = 0.965 V (vs. RHE).
