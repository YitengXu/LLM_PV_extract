    , Accepted 29th August 2018First published on 30th August 2018AbstractHerein, new organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite single crystals of complex 1 with the formula of (n-C3H7NH3)6Pb4I14 are synthesized from an aqueous HI solution containing PbI2 and propylammonium iodide. The single crystal X-ray crystallographic study shows that the structure consists of two-dimensional (2D) sheets of corner- and face-sharing [Pb2I7]3− octahedra, and the inorganic layers are separated by layers of 3-propylammonium cations. The 2D perovskite material features good film formability upon simple solution deposition. This 2D phase can be easily converted into 3D CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) perovskite via an organic-cation displacement approach, exhibiting a compact, ultrasmooth, and textured morphology. Using the film as a light absorber, planar CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells are fabricated, and the best power conversion efficiency of 19.19% is obtained with good reproducibility.
Since the first report by Miyasaka's group in 2009,1 three-dimensional (3D) perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) has emerged as one of the most promising absorber materials for solar cells due to its unique electrical, magnetic, and optical properties.2–5 In its structure, PbI64− octahedra, with a Pb2+ cation located at the center of the octahedra and I− anions lying in the corner around Pb2+, form an extended 3D network in all-corner connected mode, where methylammonium (CH3NH3+, MA+) cations fill the holes among the octahedra to balance the charge of the whole network.6–8 With the replacement of the short MA+ by a long aliphatic ammonium cation (RNH3+, R = CnH2n+1, n ≥ 2), the 3D structure will be transformed into 2D layered ((R-NH3)2PbI4) or 1D RNH3PbI3 perovskites because of the steric effect.9,10 It is generally believed that n ≥ 4 ammonium salts and lead halides will form 2D perovskites with a structure of ((CnH2n+1NH3)2PbX4) with various optical and electrical properties.11–17 However, there are few reports on CnH2n+1NH3+ cations with n = 2 and 3 used in organic–inorganic perovskites.18,19 Previously, Park et al. reported on the structural analysis of (C2H5NH3)PbI3 perovskite prepared from an equimolar mixture of C2H5NH3I and PbI2, and declared an orthorhombic structure in the space group of Pmmn.18 In another report, single crystals of (n-C3H7NH3)PbI3 with a monoclinic structure in the space group of Cc were synthesized from the solution containing equimolar n-C3H7NH3I and PbI2 in γ-butyrolactone.19 In both the structures, PbI64− octahedra were face-shared in one dimension (1D).
Herein, 2D organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite crystals were synthesized for the first time using n-C3H7NH3I and PbI2 as precursors. The chemical formula of the 2D perovskite crystal is (n-C3H7NH3)6Pb4I14 (complex 1). This 2D perovskite has good film formability upon simple solution deposition. Through the cation displacement approach reported previously,20–22 the deposited 2D perovskite can be easily converted into a 3D MAPbI3 perovskite film, exhibiting a compact, ultrasmooth and textured morphology. It should be noted that MAPbI3 perovskite films directly deposited from the solutions of PbI2 and MAI usually suffer from poor surface coverage due to the faster crystal growth and slower nucleation of the perovskite in the film formation, resulting in a low photovoltaic conversion efficiency.23–25 Thus, various elaborate efforts, such as high-vacuum vapor deposition, sequential deposition, vapor-assisted deposition, solvent engineering etc.,26–32 have been developed to mediate the perovskite crystallization during the film formation. In this report, we found that high quality MAPbI3 perovskite films can be achieved from the 2D perovskite through the organic cation-displacement approach without these elaborate efforts. With the converted film as a light absorber, planar perovskite solar cells have been fabricated with a high reproducibility of their photovoltaic performance, exhibiting the best power conversion efficiency of 19.19%, measured under AM1.5G illumination.
The single crystal complex 1 was synthesized from a reaction between PbI2 and n-propylamine (PA) in an aqueous HI solution. More details of the synthesis are provided in the ESI.† The as-synthesized yellow crystals show a rod-shaped structure with a diameter of about 1 mm and a length of 2–4 mm (Fig. S1†). Different from the 1D structural (n-C3H7NH3)PbI3 reported previously,19 where PbI64− octahedra were face-shared in one dimension, the complex 1 possesses an interesting organic–inorganic hybrid layered structure, as shown in Fig. 1. Its asymmetric unit is composed of four Pb2+ cations, fourteen I− anions and six 3-propylammonium cations (Fig. 1A). All Pb2+ ions are coordinated by six I− anions, displaying octahedral coordination geometries. Unlike purely corner-sharing octahedra extensively existing in (RNH3)2PbX4,13,14 the PbI64− octahedra in the [Pb2I7]3− inorganic layer of 1 are linked to each other in not only the corner-sharing mode but also the face-sharing mode (Fig. 1B). First, the octahedra of the Pb2 atom and the Pb3 atom adopt the face-sharing mode to connect with each other, generating a ‘dimer’ as a secondary building unit (SBU) (Fig. 1B); then the formed dimers are further linked to each other through corner-sharing with the octahedra of the Pb1 atom and the Pb4 atom, completing the two-dimensional network. Consequently, an interesting honeycomb topology with a Schläfli symbol of 63 is generated for the [Pb2I7]3− inorganic layered structure (Fig. 1C). The charge-balanced 3-propylammonium cations are exactly included among the [Pb2I7]3− inorganic layers (Fig. 1D). Notably, there exist extensive N–H⋯I hydrogen bonds, which help stabilize the crystal structure.

Generally, the 2D structure and dielectric mismatch between organic and inorganic layers would lead to strongly bound excitons with low mobility across these layers, and thus it is not suitable as a light absorber in solar cells. In the following, the organic-cation displacement approach developed will be employed to convert the 2D perovskite film to a 3D perovskite film for perovskite solar cells.20Fig. 2 schematically illustrates the processes for the fabrication of the 3D CH3NH3PbI3 film. A starting 2D complex 1 film was first solution-deposited on a substrate. After annealing at 80 °C, this film was subjected to transformation in a closed container filled with methylamine (CH3NH2, MA) gas produced by reacting methylammonium chloride with sodium hydroxide at 100 °C with CaO as the desiccant.25 The phase conversion from 2D to 3D is rapid, as evidenced by the immediate color change from light yellow to dark brown upon exposing the film to the MA atmosphere. From Fig. 3B, we observed that the XRD pattern of the complex 1 film, solution-deposited from “the pre-synthesized single crystals”, is greatly different from the single crystal powder data, and only few of the peaks appeared in the deposited film, indicating the anisotropic properties of the complex 1 in the film formation. After the conversion for 5 min, the band edge of the complex 1 was redshifted from 525 nm to 775 nm (Fig. 3A), and the diffraction peaks from the complex 1 disappeared, which are accompanied by the new peaks at 14.2° and 28.6°, as shown in Fig. 3B. The evolution of the XRD patterns was recorded at different time intervals in the cation-exchange process (Fig. S2†). The results indicate the complete transformation from the 2D complex 1 to 3D CH3NH3PbI3 [eqn (1)]. (CH3CH2CH2NH3)6Pb4I14(s) + 6CH3NH2 → 4CH3NH3PbI3(s) + 2CH3NH3I(s) + 6CH3CH2CH2NH2(g)(1) CH3NH3I(s) → CH3NH2(g) + HI(g)(2)

In the cation-displacement, excess MAI was generated in the as-converted sample; however, the peaks from MAI could not be detected in the XRD pattern. The reason for this would be ascribed to its low crystallinity as compared to the converted perovskite, similar to a previous report.32 Therefore, elemental analysis was performed for the samples scraped from the films, and the obtained results were in accordance with the reaction equation [eqn (1)].
The conversion was further confirmed by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra (as shown in Fig. S3†) and elemental analysis (as shown in Table S1†). The rapid conversion from 2D complex 1 to 3D CH3NH3PbI3 would benefit from the honeycomb structure of the 2D complex 1 for easy penetration of MA vapor and removal of the generated propylamine gas. It should be noted that after the cation displacement, one molar MAI will remain in the solid form upon the generation of two molar CH3NH3PbI3, as shown in eqn (1). From Table S1,† we observed that the concomitant MAI could be removed through further annealing at 150 °C for 10 min [eqn (2)].33 In addition, we noticed that the absorption of the annealed film was much stronger in intensity over the entire spectral region, and the diffraction peaks became narrower as compared with those of the as-converted film (as shown in Fig. S4†). These results imply the improved crystallinity of the CH3NH3PbI3 film upon the annealing, consistent with a previous report.33
The morphologies of the perovskite films before and after the cation displacement and further annealing are characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). For comparison, the morphology of the CH3NH3PbI3 film deposited from the solutions of PbI2 and MAI is characterized and shown in Fig. 4. The 2D complex 1 film deposited from its DMF solution shows excellent surface coverage without any pinholes (Fig. 4A), mainly due to its 2D nature. In addition, the presence of relatively long alkyl chains in the propylammonium cation would effectively retard the crystallization in the film formation. Consequently, the converted CH3NH3PbI3 film presented a dense and compact morphology with large crystalline domains (∼1 μm). Clearly, the full surface coverage might stem from the predeposited 2D complex 1 film. This full surface coverage with large crystalline domains could effectively prevent short circuit and suppress charge recombination in the perovskite film, leading to high device performance. In contrast, the CH3NH3PbI3 film, prepared by the conventional one-step approach, presented a typical dendrite-like morphology with very poor coverage (Fig. 4D).23 Different from the morphology-preserving evolution of the film from 3D MAPbI3 to 3D FAPbI3 reported previously,20 the conversion from 2D complex 1 leads to a dense and textured 3D CH3NH3PbI3 film with apparent grain sizes of up to 1 μm (Fig. 4B). It is clear that the grain size of ∼1 μm in the 3D MAPbI3 film converted from the 2D precursor is greatly larger than that from the previous study of the MA-gas-assisted fabrication method, which usually resulted in a perovskite grain size of about 100 nm.33 This small grain size would be attributed to the high nucleation rate of the perovskite due to the rapid evaporation of low-boiling-point MA in the liquid-state intermediate film. In this report, the 3D MAPbI3 film is converted from the solid-state 2D perovskite via in situ cation exchange and structural reorganization. The solid–gas reaction would effectively prevent rapid nucleation usually occurring for the perovskite formation from the conventional solution deposition, leading to the formation of large-sized grains in the resultant 3D perovskite film. The evolution of the morphology was recorded for the films at different time intervals in the cation-exchange process (shown in Fig. S5†). In addition, the converted film became more dense and uniform after further annealing (Fig. 4C). To further scrutinize the uniformity of the CH3NH3PbI3 film evolved from the 2D complex 1, we performed atomic force microscopy (AFM) to assess the surface roughness. As shown in Fig. 4E, the surface roughness is about 18 nm over a 10 μm × 10 μm area, and the apparent grain size observed in the AFM image is consistent with that seen in the SEM image. In contrast, the CH3NH3PbI3 film from the one-step coating shows a much larger roughness of up to 40 nm, exhibiting a dendrite-like morphology and poor coverage (Fig. 4F). In previous reports, the organic-cation displacement approach was employed for the fabrication of FAPbI3 and MAPbI3 films using the starting films of MAPbI3 and NH4PbI3 under the atmospheres of formamidine (FA) and MA, respectively. In the case of the FAPbI3 film, a pristine MAPbI3 film was exposed to FA gas at 150 °C for 5 min, during which a FAPbI3 film formed via cation exchange between MA+ and FA+, and the morphology of the FAPbI3 film resembled that of the pristine MAPbI3 film. Thus, the morphology of the final perovskite film is strongly dependent on that of the pristine perovskite film, which usually presents a poor morphology when a simple solution deposition technology is used, as shown in Fig. 4D. In the case of the MAPbI3 film, a pristine NH4PbI3 film was employed as a template. Different from the former case, a liquid intermediate phase CH3NH3PbI3·xCH3NH2 formed after the cation exchange between NH4+ and MA+. The formation of this liquid phase can improve the morphology of the resultant MAPbI3 film when the MA gas is removed. It should be noted that this cation displacement inevitably results in the MAPbI3 film with a small grain size (∼100 nm) due to the high nucleation rate of the perovskite with the rapid evaporation of low-boiling-point MA. In this report, the 3D MAPbI3 film is converted from the 2D precursor, during which the 2D perovskite is processed via in situ cation exchange and structural reorganization. The grain size of up to 1 μm in the 3D MAPbI3 film is greatly larger than that in the MAPbI3 film reported previously by the cation-displacement approach, thus potentially reducing radiative recombination centers and improving the device performance. Moreover, for other 2D hybrid perovskites such as (CnH2n+1NH3)2PbI4 (n = 4, 5 and 6), we have successfully transformed them into 3D perovskites under identical conditions. Notably, following the formation of the 3D perovskite, equimolar MAI generated simultaneously. The large amount of excess MAI should be removed at relatively higher temperatures with longer times as compared to the complex 1.

To further study the charge dynamics of the MAPbI3 film converted from the 2D complex 1, steady state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopies were then performed. For comparison, the spectroscopies of the one-step MAPbI3 film were recorded. Shown in Fig. 5A are their corresponding steady state PL spectra, where both the PL peaks located at 783 nm from MAPbI3 can be clearly observed. It is worthy of note that the MAPbI3 film processed from the 2D complex 1 possesses much higher PL intensity than its one-step counterpart, resulting from its high-quality film as discussed above. The time-resolved PL is shown in Fig. 5B, where the PL decay was fitted to a biexponential equation Y = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2),34 and the relevant data are listed in Table S2†. We attributed the quenching of the short PL lifetime to defect-induced nonradiative recombination and the quenching of the long PL lifetime to radiative recombination.35 The target layer presents a PL lifetime of ∼167 ns and a long carrier lifetime of ∼1432 ns, whereas the reference exhibits PL lifetimes of ∼67 ns and ∼359 ns, respectively. The longer lifetime of the PL transition in the target layer may be attributed to the decrease in the concentration of defects and the increase in crystallinity.36 The high intensity in steady state PL and the long PL lifetime of the target film clearly reveal the suppressed charge recombination in the dense and uniform MAPbI3 film processed from the 2D complex 1. Besides, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were measured to explore the valence state of the elements on the surface of these two MAPbI3 perovskite films. As shown in Fig. S6,† except for two main Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 peaks, a little amount of unsaturated metallic Pb (Pb0) peaks (at around 137.0 and 141.9 eV)37 was detected in the one-step film, which was not observed in the target layer. Notably, these metallic lead species in the perovskite films are likely to act as recombination centres and shorten the PL lifetime.37,38 Therefore, cation displacement provides an efficient approach for preparing high quality perovskite films with few defects.

Space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements were used to calculate the defect density of the corresponding perovskite films, and the structure of FTO/perovskite/Au was used as shown in Fig. S7.† In the double logarithmic coordinate system, the SCLC curve can be divided into three sections: the ohmic regime, the trap-filling regime and the trap-free SCLC regime.39,40 The defect density is calculated according to the following eqn (3)40 Ndefects = 2ε0εrVTFL/qL2(3)where Ndefects is the defect density, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, εr is the dielectric constant of the perovskite material, VTFL is the intersection voltage of the trap-filled limit and ohmic regime, q is the elementary charge, and L is the thickness of the perovskite film. The values of defect density (Ndefects), calculated for the MAPbI3 perovskite films by the cation-displacement and one-step methods were 6.63 × 1016 and 1.15 × 1017 cm−3, respectively. From the calculated results, we conclude that the cation-displacement method can reduce the trap density in the perovskite films and improve the film quality, which is consistent with the results of the TRPL measurements.
After the demonstration of high-quality CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films evolved from the 2D complex 1via the cation-displacement approach, planar perovskite solar cells were prepared with a structure of FTO/compact TiO2/PCBM/MAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au (Fig. S8† for the cross-sectional SEM image of a complete device). The detailed information of the device fabrication is described in the ESI.† Under AM 1.5G solar illumination, the best device with an ∼500 nm-thick perovskite layer gave the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 19.19% and 19.07% by backward and forward scanning with a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1, respectively (Fig. 6A). The small difference between the efficiencies shows negligible hysteresis, implying that the high-quality perovskite layer would reduce the overall bulk defect density and suppress charge trapping in solar cell operation. Fig. 6B shows the steady-state photocurrent and efficiency measured at the maximum power point (0.91 V). A 19.16% stabilized PCE output with a photocurrent density of 21.05 mA cm−2 was achieved over the course of several minutes under continuous light-soaking (Fig. 6B), which is very close to the PCE obtained from the reverse scan J–V measurements. It can be concluded that the target device exhibits an excellent stability near the maximum power point. Fig. 6C describes the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) over the spectral range from 400 to 800 nm. The cation displacement technique achieved high IPCE values, well consistent with the strong absorption in the spectral region for the high-quality perovskite film. Integration of the IPCE spectrum over the solar emission yields an AM 1.5 photocurrent of 21.05 mA cm−2 for the perovskite device, in excellent agreement with the measured Jsc value, indicating that the spectral mismatch between our simulator and the true AM 1.5 solar emission is negligibly small. Moreover, PCEs for the 20 devices fabricated by the current method and the one-step approach are presented in Fig. 6D, respectively. It is obvious that the cation-displacement devices display higher PCEs than the one-step ones. Besides, the PCEs of the former devices are focused at about 18.7%, showing a quite narrow scope. In contrast, a wide range from 11% to 14% for the efficiencies of the control devices was observed. This reflects the excellent reproducibility of the target devices. These results suggest that the 2D perovskite can be employed as a novel intermediate for the fabrication of high-quality 3D perovskite films for efficient solar cells.

Conclusions
In this study, new perovskite single crystals of complex 1 were synthesized and characterized. In the structure, the PbI64− octahedra in the [Pb2I7]3− inorganic layer are linked to each other in the corner-sharing and face-sharing modes. The 2D perovskite-based film can be deposited using a simple spin-coating technique, exhibiting excellent surface coverage. By a simple organic-cation displacement reaction, the 2D phase can be easily converted into a high quality 3D CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film. Using this film as a light absorber, planar perovskite solar cells were fabricated with a power conversion efficiency of 19.19% and good reproducibility. This technique may provide a robust and efficient approach to realize highly efficient perovskite solar cells for practical application.
