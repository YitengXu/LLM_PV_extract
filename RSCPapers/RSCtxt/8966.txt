Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have attracted significant attention as a promising low-cost alternatives to conventional Si solar cells since the first report by O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991,1 and high conversion efficiencies of 11–12% have been achieved in DSCs with Ru complexes as sensitizers and liquid electrolyte containing I−/I3−.2,3 As alternative light absorbers, recently, semiconductor quantum dots (QDs, including CdS, CdSe, PbS, etc.)4–9 have been extensively explored to replace metallorganic sensitizers for the preparation of QDs sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) due to their high extinction coefficient, tunable optical property (quantum effect), and potential multiple exciton generation.10,11 Although QDs have specific advantages over organic and metallorganic sensitizers, the conversion efficiencies of QDs-sensitized DSCs are not satisfactory. The most efficient I−/I3− based liquid electrolyte in DSCs was found not to be chemically compatible with most QDs in QDSCs.12 At present, the S2−/Sx based electrolyte was reported to give the highest efficiency.13 With this liquid electrolyte, however, the device would suffer from undesirable charge recombination between the electrolyte species and accumulated electrons on the TiO2 surface incompletely covered by the QDs, resulting in poor fill factor, and thus efficiency.7,14 Moreover, considering long-term stability, QDSCs with liquid electrolyte may limit their practical applications. Thus, it is necessary to develop new materials and replace the liquid electrolyte with solid-state counterparts.
As an efficient hole conductor and light absorber, regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) has been extensively investigated in a series of photoelectric devices.15 In our previous report, P3HT was found to act as an effective hole transport medium in DSC with an organic or metallorganic sensitizer.16 In the present work, P3HT was applied as a hole conductor for the preparation of solid-state QDSCs, where CdS quantum dots (QDs) were employed on the TiO2 electrode by a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction deposition (SILAR) method. Different from the I−/I3− or S2−/Sx liquid electrolyte, the solid-state device with P3HT presented a much broader and enhanced spectral response in the region of 400–700 nm, indicating that P3HT acts as both an efficient hole conductor and an assistant sensitizer in the device. As a result, a high power conversion efficiency of 1.42% was achieved in the solid-state CdS QDSCs under AM 1.5 (100 mW cm2) illumination.
For the fabrication of the QDSCs, FTO-coated glass substrate was first cleaned with detergent, ultrasonicated in acetone and isopropyl alcohol, and subsequently dried in air. A 40 nm dense TiO2 layer was deposited on a patterned FTO coated glass substrate (10 ohm □−1, Nippon Sheet Glass) by spin coating with tetraisopropyl orthotitanate in ethanol, as reported previously.17 A 2 μm porous TiO2 layer was then deposited on it by the doctor blade technique with TiO2 paste (particle size, 60 nm) synthesized according to the previous report.18 The dense TiO2 layer was introduced to prevent short circuiting due to direct contact of CdS and P3HT with FTO through the void incompletely covered by the porous TiO2 layer. After calcination at 500 °C for 30 min, the resulting TiO2 electrode was treated with an aqueous solution of 0.4 M TiCl4 for 30 min at 70 °C. After calcination again at 500 °C for 30 min, the cooled TiO2 electrode was immediately coated with CdS QDs using the SILAR method. Briefly, a TiO2 electrode was first dipped into a methanol solution of 0.05 M Cd(NO3)2 for 1 min at room temperature, and then pure methanol for 1 min. After being dried in air, the electrode was immersed in a methanol solution of 0.05 M Na2S for 1 min, and then pure methanol for 1 min. The four-step procedure was regarded as one cycle. After the CdS QD coating, regioregular P3HT (Aldrich) with 80-nm thickness was applied on it by spin coating from a polymer solution (20 mg ml−1) in chlorobenzene at 2000 rpm. Finally, 70-nm thick gold was deposited on the polymer surface as a counter-electrode under high vacuum (10−4 Pa), giving five parallel samples on one substrate with an active area of 4 mm2 for each. For comparison, conventional I−/I3− and S2−/Sx liquid electrolytes were employed for the same CdS QDs-sensitized TiO2 electrode with Pt-coated ITO counter electrode in the QDSCs, respectively, where I−/I3− electrolyte was composed of 0.6 M 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2 and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile–valeronitrile (1:1, v/v), and the S2−/Sx liquid electrolyte was composed of 0.5 M Na2S, 2 M S and 0.2 M KCl in methanol–water (7:3, v/v). The photocurrent–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the device were recorded using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter under air mass (AM) 1.5 simulated illumination (100 mW cm−2, Oriel, 67005) at 25 °C. The action spectra of the monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for solar cells were carried out by using a commercial setup for IPCE measurement (PV-25 DYE, JASCO). All the fabrication processes and performance measurements of the devices were carried out in air.
The loading amount of CdS in the TiO2 film was evaluated from the UV-vis absorption spectrum. Fig. 1 shows the absorption spectra of TiO2 electrodes after different cycles of the SILAR coating with CdS. A swift increase of the absorption is clearly seen as well as the shift of the absorption edge to longer wavelength with the increase of coating cycles from 1 to 7, while minor changes are observed in the spectra with further increasing coating cycles. The increase of absorption means an increase of amounts of CdS deposited, and the red shift of the absorption edges with increasing coating cycles can be explained by the quantum-size effect. Seven coating cycles were employed for the CdS deposition in the TiO2 film used in the QDSCs.

The action spectra of the incident photon–to–current conversion efficiency (IPCE) as a function of wavelength were recorded for the DSCs with P3HT hole conductor, conventional I−/I3− and S2−/Sx liquid electrolytes, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2. The IPCE spectra of the devices for the I−/I3− and S2−/Sx liquid electrolytes have similar shapes with values of 22 and 44% in the region 400–480 nm, respectively. Both the spectra closely resemble that of the UV–vis absorption spectrum of CdS quantum dots, indicating the CdS contribution to the spectral response. Low IPCE observed in the device with the I−/I3− electrolyte can be attributed to a degradation of CdS in the electrolyte.14 Different from the IPCE spectra in the devices with the I−/I3− and S2−/Sx electrolytes, the P3HT based device presented a much broader and enhanced spectral response in the region of 400–700 nm. The additional high response in the long wavelength clearly indicated the contribution from P3HT as an assistant sensitizer in the device due to the good band alignment among TiO2, CdS and P3HT as shown in the inset of Fig. 2, similar to our previous report.16

The J–V curves were measured for the three devices with P3HT, I−/I3− or S2−/Sx electrolyte as shown in Fig. 3, and the resulting photovoltaic data are summarized in Table 1. The device using P3HT hole conductor gave much higher JSC of 4.31 mA cm−2, while those using I−/I3− and S2−/Sx electrolytes gave 1.62 and 3.45 mA cm−2, respectively. The result is in consistent with the IPCE behaviour observed and discussed above. As compared with DSCs with Ru complexes or organic dyes, the CdS QDs based DSCs showed much lower Voc values of 0.50 and 0.57 V for I−/I3− and S2−/Sx, respectively.2,3 The low Voc values imply significant charge recombination in the devices, which probably results from the reaction between species in the electrolyte and accumulated electrons on the TiO2 surface covered incompletely by the QDs.19 Very interestingly, a higher Voc of 0.67 V was achieved in the device using P3HT hole conductor, implying that the recombination behaviour could be weakened in the interface between the TiO2 and solid P3HT. In addition, a higher fill factor (FF) of 0.50 was achieved in the P3HT based QDSC, as compared with values of 0.27 and 0.44 for the devices with I−/I3− and S2−/Sx electrolytes, respectively. The lower FF may relate to undesirable recombination between the electrolyte and electrons on the TiO2 surface in the I−/I3− or S2−/Sx liquid electrolyte based QDSCs.20 Thus, the higher FF of 0.50 in the P3HT based device may imply that P3HT on the surface of TiO2 can block the charge recombination, similar to the passivation function from a conformal ZnS coating or grafting of dipolar molecules on TiO2 surface reported previously.14,19

In conclusion, a novel CdS QDSC was fabricated with P3HT as both a hole transport material and an assistant sensitizer. As compared with the devices using I−/I3− and S2−/Sx liquid electrolytes, significant improvement on Jsc, Voc and FF was observed in the P3HT based device, resulting in a power-conversion efficiency of 1.42% under an AM1.5 G 100 mW cm−2 condition, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the highest value reported for CdS QDs-sensitized solid solar cells.5 The results suggested that P3HT could work well as an desirable hole conductor for the preparation of CdS QDs-sensitized solid solar cell, and also can act as an assistant sensitizer in combination with CdS QDs sensitizer in the QDSC. Further enhancement of the efficiencies can be expected through employment of lower band-gap QDs for increasing light harvesting ability, and finely tuning of the device architecture.
