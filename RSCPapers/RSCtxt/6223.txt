, Accepted 5th August 2013First published on 7th August 2013AbstractThis paper has focused on the synthesis and modification of TiO2 nanomaterial via an acid modified sol–gel process. ZrOCl2 was used as a source of Zr for doping titania. The nanomaterials were characterized by electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms, UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, etc. Changes in the band gap of the synthesized nanomaterials were studied with respect to the dopant amount, and the performance of the synthesized nanomaterials was evaluated as a photocatalyst to degrade pesticide quinalphos in aqueous solution under UV light. Anatase TiO2 nanocrystallites with an average size of ca. 8–11 nm were obtained depending on the amount of dopant. The results showed that the amount of dopant significantly altered the band gap as well as the surface properties of the hybrid nanomaterials which resulted in high photocatalytic activity.
Introduction
Heterogeneous photocatalysis has become the most interesting topic in recent years due to its potential applications in water and air purification and remediation.1 TiO2 is a unique and the most widely studied heterogeneous photocatalyst because of its low cost, ultra-stability and non-toxicity.2 However, the photocatalytic activity of pure titania is not high enough for practical purposes.3 The principal impediment is that TiO2 absorbs a relatively small fraction (3–5%) of the solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface.4 A review of the literature shows that studies have focused on shifting of the band gap of TiO2 to the visible spectral region, which would potentially allow a more efficient utilization of solar energy and greatly expand its applications.5–7 It has been reported that dopants that have energy levels between the conduction and valence bands of TiO2 can act as charge recombination centres and are detrimental to the photocatalytic performance of TiO2.8
ZrO2 is one promising alternative photocatalyst to TiO2, which is quite effective for the degradation of a greater variety of pollutants. ZrO2 has a band gap of ca. 5.0 eV and the reduction potential of the conduction band is −1.0 V vs. NHE and that for the valence band is 4.0 V vs. NHE.9 Similar values of electronegativity (EN) and ionic radius (r) of Zr4+ (EN = 1.40, r = 0.084 nm) and Ti4+ (EN = 1.54, r = 0.061 nm) as well as their isovalence state always ensure doping of zirconium into the matrix of titania.10 It has been determined experimentally that addition of even small amounts of Zr can decrease the particle size of TiO2 and hence prevent phase transitions from anatase to rutile.11–13 Possible reasons for the improvement in the photocatalytic performance of Zr-doped titania can be summarized as the decreased particle size, the high surface area, and the thermal stability of the anatase phase, as well as formation of defects on the TiO2 surface.14,15 Only a few reports have been published on TiO2 photocatalyst doped with Zr.16–20
The present work reports the synthesis of nanocrystalline Zr doped and undoped mesoporous titania through a sol–gel route. The synthetic method involves the use of acetic acid as a reactive intermediate, and its role in the sol–gel stage based on the HSAB principle is discussed. The role of Zr dopants in decreasing the titania crystallite size, thermal stability of the anatase phase, enhancement of the specific surface area and enhancement of photocatalytic activity was studied. The photocatalytic activity was dependent on both the structural and textural characteristics of doped titania.
Materials and methods
Titanium isopropoxide and zirconium oxychloride were procured from Sigma-Aldrich, and glacial acetic acid was obtained from Merck. The pesticide quinalphos was procured from Dhanuka Agritech Limited. All materials were used as received. All the solutions were prepared with deionized water.
Synthesis of the photocatalysts
Titanium(IV) isopropoxide (4.7 ml) was hydrolyzed using 9.0 ml glacial acetic acid at 0 °C. To this solution, 98.8 ml deionized water was added dropwise under vigorous stirring for 1 hour, and subsequently the solution was ultrasonicated for 15 minutes in an ice bath. Then the stirring was continued for further 4.5 hours and again the solution was ultrasonicated for 15 minutes in an ice bath until a clear solution was obtained. The prepared solution was kept under dark conditions for a nucleation process for 24 hours. It was then gelated in an oven at 70 °C for 12 hours. The gel was dried at 100 °C and subsequently the resulting material was powdered and then calcined in a muffle furnace at 500 °C for 5 hours. The preparation of Zr/TiO2 nanomaterial was the same as that of pure TiO2, except that the ZrOCl2 used was 0.05, 0.5, 2 and 5 mol% compared to TiO2. The undoped titania was named T, while all the doped titania were named according to their dopant amount as 0.05 TZ, 0.5 TZ, 2 TZ and 5 TZ respectively.
Characterization
X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples were collected at room temperature using CuKα radiation (wavelength λ = 1.5406 Å) by a Philips Analytical diffractometer and the diffraction intensity was measured in the 2θ range between 20° and 90°. The Scherrer formula D = 0.9λ/βcosθ, where λ is the wavelength characteristic of the CuKα radiation, β is the full width at half maximum (in radians) and θ is the angle at which the 100% intensity peak appears, was used to determine the average crystallite size. SEM images of the mesoporous samples were recorded using a variable pressure Digital Scanning Electron Microscope (Model JSM – 6380 LA). XPS spectra were taken using a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250 instrument (CAMCOR, University of Oregon). A transmission electron microscopy (TEM) study was carried out using a JEM-2100, Jeol electron microscopy instrument. The percentage weight loss of the photocatalyst was estimated by thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) using METTLER TOLEDO TGA/DSC-1. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms were obtained for the samples using a Micromeritics Tristar 3000 Surface Area and Porosity Analyzer. The surface area was calculated using the BET equation and the mean pore size diameter was calculated by the BJH method. For the TiO2 and Zr/TiO2 photocatalysts explored in this work, the band gap energy was estimated by the Kubelka–Munk method using a HITACHI, UV-VISIBLE u-4100 spectrophotometer. The band gap of the samples was determined by using the equation Eg = 1239.8/λ,21 where Eg is the band gap energy (eV) and λ (nm) is the wavelength of the absorption edges in the spectra. The band gap was also determined from the Tauc plot using eqn (1) 
αhν = A (hν − Eg)1/2
(1)where A is a constant which is different for different transitions, h is Planck's constant, ν is the frequency of light and α is the attenuation constant. There is a proportionality relation between ln[Rmax − Rmin/R − Rmin] and band gap, where Rmax and Rmin are the maximum and minimum reflectance in reflection spectra and R is the reflectance for any intermediate energy photons recorded. A plot of hν in the abscissa and the square of ln[hν (Rmax − Rmin/R − Rmin)] in the ordinate gives a curve. Intersection of the tangent in the abscissa gives the band gap of the semiconductor.22 FTIR spectra were recorded on pellets of the samples (0.25%) mixed with KBr, using a PERKIN ELMER RXIFT-112 spectrometer. Raman spectra measurements were performed using a Laser micro Raman System, Horiba Jobin Vyon LABRAM HR, and room temperature PL spectra were measured using a HITASHI F1 2500 spectrophotometer with a Xe lamp as an excitation source.
Quinalphos degradation
For studying photocatalytic experiments under UV light, the desired pesticide quinalphos solution was prepared in double distilled water and an immersion well photochemical reactor (HEBER) made of Pyrex glass was used in this study. Irradiations were carried out using 25 W, 254 nm and 15 W, 254 nm medium pressure mercury lamps. IR radiation and short wavelength UV radiation were eliminated using a water circulating Pyrex glass jacket. The quinalphos solution (800 ml of 10−5 M) was poured into the Pyrex vessel of the photo reactor. Aqueous dispersions of the catalyst were prepared by addition of a given weight (0.203 g) of the catalyst to about 50 ml of aqueous solution of the pesticide and sonicated it in a sonicator for 5 min. The dispersion is then put into the Pyrex vessel of the photoreactor along with an additional amount of the quinalphos solution (10−5 M) just enough to fill the vessel. The dispersions were kept under constant air bubbling with the help of the air pump during irradiation. At intervals of 10 min, 10 ml aliquots of the reaction mixture were withdrawn and were analyzed by recording variations of the absorption band maximum (238.5 nm for quinalphos) using a UV-visible spectrometer. The rate of decomposition of the pesticide can thus be determined from the absorption vs. time plots and the degradation rate of quinalphos could be obtained by:  where De is the degradation rate of quinalphos after t minutes of reaction, Ct is the concentration of quinalphos after t min of reaction, and C0 is the initial concentration. The photocatalytic activity of the catalyst samples can be quantitatively evaluated by comparing the apparent reaction rate constants (k). The photocatalytic degradation of quinalphos is a pseudo-first-order reaction, and its kinetics according to the Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetic model can be expressed as follows: ln(C0/Ct) = kt, where C0 and Ct are respectively the initial concentration and the reaction concentration of quinalphos after time t.
Results
Characterization of synthesized materials
Livage and co-workers reported earlier that acetic acid is a very good acid catalyst which can stabilize metal alkoxide.23–27 Acetic acid serves as a chelating or bridging ligand and gives rise to a condensation pattern producing linear chains and enclosing pores that result in high surface area.28 This is because the acid-catalyzed condensation is directed preferentially toward the ends rather than the middle of the chains. Fig. 1a and 1b shows the FTIR pattern of undoped and Zr-doped samples showing peaks corresponding to the stretching vibrations of OH groups (3379–3420 cm−1) and bending vibrations of adsorbed molecular water (1620–1639 cm−1).
 Fig. 1  (a) IR spectrum of undoped titania T. (b) IR spectrum of Zr-doped titania. 
As acetic acid is used as a hydrolysis catalyst, the coordination of the acetate ion is observed. For undoped sample T the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of acetate ligands arise as a doublet respectively at 1428 cm−1 and 1528 cm−1 and are due to titanium acetate complex.29 The frequency separation (∼Δν = 100 cm−1) that exists between the νsym (COO) and the νasym (COO) bands is consistent with the bridging bidentate acetate ligands.30 A high frequency separation that exists between the νsym (COO), at 1335 cm−1, and the νasym (COO), at 1610 cm−1, bands of Zr doped titania (Fig. 1b) is consistent with the presence of asymmetric bridging bidentate acetate ligands compared to the undoped titania gels.
This enhanced bridge formation between titanium and Zr species may be explained on the basis of the HSAB principle. As the number of bridging acetate ligands is more in Zr-doped samples it is obvious that Ti–O–Zr bonds will be much more stable than Ti–O–Ti bonds in titania and as a result conversion of the anatase to rutile phase will be hindered. All the samples show a shoulder at 1029 cm−1. This is attributed to the anatase Ti–O bond vibration31 which is formed during gelation at room temperature. The undoped sample shows a peak at 660 cm−1, which is the characteristic peak of anatase titania,32 but in the case of Zr-doped samples a new peak was observed at 489 cm−1, which may be due to the formation of Ti–O–Zr bonds.33 The pure ZrO2 shows Zr–O stretching vibration at 430 cm−1.34 The substitution process of Ti4+ by Zr4+ can then modify the interaction forces between the O–Ti–O and O–Zr–O bonds, which can lead to considerable displacement of the absorption band to the high wave number region (455 cm−1–550 cm−1). Spectra for Zr doped samples 0.05 TZ and 5 TZ showed a very intense and sharp band at 2335 cm−1. This band has been assigned to CO2 trapped inside the bulk structure of the oxide.35 The capacity for adsorption of Zr-doped titania increases with the increase in the Zr dopant amount. In general the FTIR spectra show the presence of acetate bridges with Ti and Zr, which is stable up to 500 °C, while the undoped titania shows more chelating acetate ligands. According to Doeuff et al., carboxylic acid not only acts as an acid catalyst, but also as a ligand and changes the alkoxide precursor at a molecular level by forming bridging or chelating complexes, therefore modifying the whole hydrolysis condensation process of titanium alkoxide in the presence of acetic acid.27 In addition, as a catalyst and chelating agent, the acetic acid participated as a reactant in the binary system of the present study. There is general agreement that 2 alkoxy groups bonded to a metal can be replaced by acetate groups in solution relatively easily.36,37
  
The relative rate of the hydrolysis and condensation steps alters the morphology and the other properties of the sol–gel products.
The powder XRD patterns of Zr4+ doped titania prepared by acid catalysed homogeneous hydrolysis of ZrOCl2 and titanium isopropoxide calcined at 500 °C are shown in Fig. 2. A comparison of the 2θ value of the sample (as prepared and calcined) with the JCPDS 84-1286 showed that the samples were anatase phase of titania. No peaks were present that correspond to a rutile phase.
 Fig. 2  XRD of the calcined undoped and Zr-doped titania. 
The broadening of diffraction peaks indicates the small size of nanocrystalline titania. No peaks were present that correspond to a rutile phase. The powders do not show any significant peaks that correspond to the Zr atom or the oxides of zirconium. No peaks were found that indicate the existence of any different phase that coexists in the doped sample. The XRD peaks of the (101), (200), and (004) crystal planes of anatase were selected to determine the lattice parameters. The unit cell parameters ‘a’ and ‘c’ of T were found to be 3.77 Å and 9.13 Å, while for the Zr-doped sample 0.05 TZ the values were 3.78 Å and 9.44 Å respectively. A slight shift in the d-spacing with an observable change in cell parameters indicates the incorporation of dopants into the TiO2 lattice. The average size of crystallites was calculated using the Scherrer equation. The average crystallite size of the samples calcined at 500 °C was found to be ca. 8.6 nm for T, 13.53 nm for 0.05 TZ, 10.82 nm for 0.5 TZ, 10.3 nm for 2 TZ and 9.7 nm for 5 TZ. As is evident from the values, the size of Zr-doped titania samples is larger than the undoped titania T (Table 1).

The ionic radii value of doped Zr4+ is between that of Ti4+ (0.068 nm) and O2− (0.132 nm). Therefore, the Zr4+ (0.084 nm) should either replace the Ti4+ site or go to the interstitial sites. Because of the mismatch of the ionic sizes of Ti4+ and Zr4+ (0.068 and 0.084 nm, respectively), there is also a chance for the Zr4+ ions to go to the interstitial sites. Also, the anatase phase is fairly stable up to 500 °C in the titania samples. The dopant in these acid modified solids tends to stabilize the anatase phase and prevent phase transformation. It has been found that with the increase in the amount of Zr in the sample the grain size decreases. This reduction in crystallite size may be due to segregation of the dopant cations at the grain boundary, which inhibits grain growth by restricting direct contact of grains. Zr4+ ions probably became segregated in the grain boundaries of anatase titania grains. This may lead to an increase in the diffusion barrier at the titania–titania grain contact, which is needed for the grain growth process. Also, those Zr4+ ions that have replaced the Ti4+ sites will have a stabilizing effect on the Ti–O bond because the more electropositive Zr4+ will donate its electron density to O2−. O2− with high electron concentration can use this increased concentration of electrons to strengthen the bonding between the less electropositive Ti4+ ions.29 This stabilization of the Ti–O bond will in turn retard the A–R transformation temperature because the A–R transformation needs the breakage of Ti–O bonds. In Zr doped samples it is difficult to break the Ti–O bond because of the increased bond strength rendered by the Zr4+ ions. It is interesting to note that the addition of even 0.05% Zr4+ could bring about this considerable improvement in properties, which is attributed to the specific synthesis route followed in this synthesis. Out of three different states of titania, viz. amorphous, crystalline and mesoporous, the mesoporous titania is the most photocatalytically active photocatalyst because it has a high surface to volume ratio and offers more active sites for carrying out catalytic reactions. But high temperature calcination often leads to collapse of the mesoporous framework and loss of surface area due to facile crystallization of TiO2 and the subsequent growth. XRD patterns with a single intense line at high d spacing are typically observed in materials featuring non-ordered mesopores.38,39 The as-synthesized catalysts gave low angle XRD at the 2 theta value 0.7°. In the case of Zr-doped titania the mesostructure of Zr-doped titania was retained even after calcinations at 500 °C as was evident from the low-angle XRD of Zr-doped titania (Fig. S1†) but in the case of undoped titania the mesostructure was completely destroyed at 500 °C. Thus Zr-doping leads to thermal stability of the synthesized materials.
The TGA of Zr-doped and undoped titania (Fig. S2†) showed weight loss up to 480 °C, indicating complete loss of template and water. Therefore the samples were calcined at 500 °C to ascertain complete removal of water and templates. It appeared from the thermogravimetric curve that the loss of water in T was sharp and rapid. However, in 0.5 TZ with an increase of temperature the loss of water was slow and there was a stable region between 200 and 350 °C which at further higher temperature ca. 350 °C showed a sharp weight decrease with the loss of water or acetate. The presence of Zr caused a marked difference in the thermogravimetric curve.
The effects of doping different amounts of Zr on the microstructures and morphology of the Zr–TiO2 nanomaterials were characterized by SEM and HRTEM analysis. It can be seen from the SEM micrographs (Fig. 3) that the as-prepared samples were composed of spherical nanostructures, though the size of the individual nanostructure varies with the amount of Zr present in the samples. The EDX (S3) also confirmed the presence of Zr in the Zr-doped samples. The size of the spherical nanoparticles changes significantly with Zr composition, which might be attributed to the formation of different Zr–Ti hexamer building blocks.

Fig. 4 shows HRTEM images of 0.05 TZ. The TEM images of 0.05 TZ (Fig. S4†) indicated that the acid catalysed sol–gel derived Zr-doped photo catalysts were almost spherical, except a few that have irregular shapes as a result of aggregation. The size of 0.05 TZ particles, as observed from low magnification TEM images, was ca. 13.7 nm, which is also consistent with average crystallite values given by XRD. Fused crystal boundaries were clearly evident in its high-magnification TEM image indicating a highly crystallized well resolved crystal structure. The observed spacing between the lattice points of 0.05 TZ is 0.35 nm, corresponding to the (101) plane of the anatase crystal.

The N2 physisorption analysis (Fig. 5a) showed that all the nanomaterials calcined at 500 °C for 5 hours exhibited type IV isotherms with a hysteresis loop, indicating the presence of mesopores. It has been reported that spherical particles have this type of isotherm.26 For undoped titania (T) the hysteresis loop is positioned at the top, giving a higher surface area of 184 m2 g−1. The surface area of Zr doped titania 0.05 TZ and 5 TZ were 77 and 66 m2 g−1 respectively. The decrease of surface area was also consistent with the decrease of pore volume in the doped samples (0.31 cm3 g−1) in comparison to undoped samples (0.33 cm3 g−1).
 Fig. 5  (a) BET Surface area of T, 0.05 TZ and 5 TZ. (b) BJH pore size distributions for T, 0.05 TZ, 5 TZ. 
The BJH pore size distributions of the nanomaterials synthesized at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 5b. The average pore size distribution showed that the pore diameters of T, 5 TZ and 0.05 TZ were ca. 4 nm, ca. 7 nm and ca. 13 nm, which according to the IUPAC definition still were in the mesoporous range.
UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra of the synthesized samples are shown in Fig. 6a. Undoped TiO2 crystals did not show any abrupt variation in the 400 nm range. The optical absorption continues to rise at lower wavelengths with a broad absorption maximum apparent in the UV region at 300 nm for undoped titania T. The doped samples had comparatively distinct maxima and sharp bands (intense absorption) in the same region with a change in the peak value at 340 nm. The Kubelka–Munk plots of ln[hν (Rmax − Rmin/R − Rmin)] versus hν for 0.5 TZ and 5 TZ are depicted in Fig. 6b. The above plot was used to calculate the band gap. For undoped titania T the band gap value is ca. 3.12 eV which is the recognized band gap of anatase titania. For doped titania the values are ca. 2.90 eV for 0.05 TZ, ca. 2.84 eV for 0.5 TZ, ca. 2.77 eV for 2 TZ and ca. 2.71 for 5 TZ.

It clearly indicates the presence of mid-bands in the visible region in doped samples.
The optical absorption edge (visible region) of the crystals shifted slightly to higher wavelength in doped samples. With the difference in doping amount as well as difference in average crystallite sizes of the doped samples results variations in the band gap values of the synthesized samples. Zr4+ ion doping has a significant effect on the absorption characteristics of TiO2.40 It was anticipated that large differences in optical properties would be required in order to cause changes in photocatalytic behaviour. Changes in the optical gap or absorbance onset of a semiconductor material as a function of particle size can occur due to quantum confinement effects (Brus, 1986).41
The surface oxidation states and binding energy (BE) of titanium and zirconium were analyzed by XPS. Fig. 7 shows the XPS peaks associated with titanium and zirconium in 5 mol% Zr/nano-TiO2. The binding energies of Ti 2p (Fig. 7a) photoelectron peaks at 458.4 and 464.2 eV corresponds to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 lines, respectively.42 These values indicate that titanium is present in the +4 oxidation state. The Zr 3d photoelectron peaks (Fig. 7b) were observed at 181.2 and 183.9 eV corresponding to Zr 3d5/2 and Zr 3d3/2, respectively, which are assigned to the +4 oxidation state of zirconium.40 These results indicate that in Zr-doped TiO2 both titanium and zirconium metal ions are present in their highest oxidation state after calcinations at 500 °C.

As we know, XRD usually reveals the long-range order of materials and gives average structural information within several unit cells whereas Raman spectroscopy is a highly specific analytical method which is sensitive to crystallinity and microstructures of the materials. As shown in Fig. 8, the Raman spectrum shows principal peaks at ca. 142 (Eg (1)), 197 (Eg (2)), 399 (B1g (1)), 519 (A1g, B1g (2)) and 639 cm−1 (Eg (3)). The appearance of these peaks confirms that the synthesized nanomaterials consist of anatase phase of titania.43 The small difference in the positions of these peaks (Raman shift; Fig. S5†) reflects the difference in the vibrational motions, possibly due to the structural difference because of the possible lattice distortion brought about by the Zr dopant.

Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra have been widely used to investigate the fate of electron/hole pairs in semiconductor particles, since PL emission results from the recombination of free carriers. The sample quantity used for the measurement was the same (50 mg), and the samples were excited at a wavelength of 300 nm. The spectra show distinct peaks at about 398 and 480 nm. The first emission at 398 nm is attributed to the direct transition from the conduction band to the valence band, whereas the latter at 480 nm is the emission signal originating from the charge transfer transition from an oxygen vacancy trapped electron.44 The PL spectra at 398 nm show that a decrease in band gap values in Zr-doped titania leads to an increase in the intensity of spectra due to direct transition of electrons from the conduction band to the valence band [S6]. Interestingly, the intensities of PL spectra for Zr-doped TiO2 catalysts at 480 nm show a significant decrease indicating that Zr doping can effectively inhibit excited electron and hole recombination (Fig. 9).
 Fig. 9  PL spectra of T, 0.05 TZ and 5 TZ. 
The effective inhibition of excited electron and hole recombination due to Zr doping can be explained by the following two pathways. First, the surface hydroxyl groups can be trapped by the holes to form hydroxyl radicals which can suppress electron–hole recombination and thus the PL intensity. Second, theoretical and experimental investigations indicated that Zr doping favors the formation of oxygen vacancies. The electron is trapped by the oxygen vacancy, while the hole is trapped by the doped Zr, which can decrease the PL intensity. For the Zr–TiO2 samples, the Zr metal45,46 was used to produce the Schotty barrier to facilitate the electron capture. The presence of Zr on TiO2 favors the migration of photo-produced electrons to Zr, thus improving the electron–hole separation. Subsequently, electrons migrate from Zr to O2 molecules.47 Moreover, the density of free electrons of TiO2 with Zr dopant is less than that of undoped TiO2, and promotes the photo-adsorption of O2 molecules on the surface of Zr-doped photo-catalysts. So, the rate of electron transfer to oxygen increases, and the recombination rate of electron–hole pairs decreases. These changes benefit the photo-oxidation of organic compounds on the surface of photo-catalysts.
Photocatalytic activity studies
Environmental contamination and serious hazards through misuse of a variety of pesticides have attracted global attention. Quinalphos (O,O-diethyl-O-quinaxalin-2-yl phosphoro thiodate) due to its acaricidal and insecticidal properties is in large scale use now-a-days. Many steps have been suggested to mitigate the serious environmental contamination problem. Photocatalytic degradation of pesticides is one of them. So photo degradation of quinalphos was used as a probe reaction to test the photocatalytic activity of prepared Zr-doped catalysts (Fig. S7†). The pollutant quinalphos is colourless and shows an absorption maximum at 238.5 nm. Hence UV light photodegradation of quinalphos was carried out to measure the photocatalytic activity of synthesized catalysts. The photocatalytic activity of all catalysts was evaluated by measuring the absorbance (At) of the quinalphos UV-visible spectrum at 238.5 nm at 10 min intervals. With the assumption that Beer's law was obeyed, the graph of At/A0 against t (where A0 is the intensity of the quinalphos peak at 238.5 nm after stirring in the dark) is equivalent to the graph of Ct/C0 against t and the latter was plotted as shown in Fig. 10.
 Fig. 10  Comparison of photocatalytic properties of different samples. 
It can be seen that all Zr-doped titania outperformed the undoped titania in the degradation of quinalphos. It can also be seen that the 0.5 TZ sample with 0.5 mol% Zr doping is more effective in photodegradation.
Knowing that pure zirconium oxide has quite a high band gap ca. 5.65 eV we can say that it cannot act as a photocatalyst in this case. The increase in photoactivity of synthesized Zr-doped photocatalysts must be due to interaction between Zr4+ and Ti4+ ions in titania. That led to several modifications in physical properties such as the band gap, thermal stability, particle size and photoluminescence properties. Although the specific surface areas (SBET) of undoped titania are 184 m2 g−1 higher than that of Zr-doped titania (77 m2 g−1 for 5 TZ), still the photocatalytic activity in Zr-doped samples is higher.
If the reaction constant k is normalized by SBET, the increase of photoactivity under UV light is more significant.
Effect of lamp power on the photodegradation of quinalphos
Two different UV light sources were used and their effect on photodegradation was studied. As expected the 25 W bulb operating at 254 nm wavelengths is more efficient in degrading quinalphos than the 15 W bulb (Fig. 11).
 Fig. 11  Comparison of photocatalytic activity under 25 W and 15 W UV bulbs. 
Effect of Zr loading
Many studies48,49 have applied the Langmuir–Hinshelwood (L–H) expression [eqn (2)] for the analysis of heterogeneous photocatalytic reactions 
Rate = −dC/dT = kL–H KadsC/1 + KadsC(2)
(2)where kL–H is the reaction rate constant in mol dm−3 min−1; Kads is the adsorption coefficient of the reactant on TiO2 in (mol dm−3)−1; and C is the concentration of the solute in mol dm−3. Integration of eqn (2) yields the following equation: 
ln(C0/Ct) + K(C0 − Ct) = kL–H Kadst
(3)when the initial concentration C0 is small, eqn (3) changes to eqn (4), which expresses a pseudo-first-order reaction kinetic regime

The plots of ln(C0/Ct) vs. irradiation time for dye (where C0 is the initial concentration of dye and Ct is the concentration of dye in the reaction time) were linear, and this suggests that photodegradation reactions follow pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics.
As a benchmark commercial titania and undoped titania have rate constants 0.002 min−1 and 0.003 min−1, respectively. The enhancement of photocatalytic activity (0.0056 min−1) occurred for 0.05% Zr loading. At higher than 0.5 mol% Zr, the photocatalytic activity decreased (0.00678 min−1 for 0.5 TZ, 0.0054 min−1 for 2 TZ and 0.0064 min−1 for 5 TZ). The decrease of PL intensity was in good agreement with the enhancement of the first-order kinetic constant for Zr-doped TiO2. However, there was an optimum dosage. When the content of Zr was lower than its optimal level, the Zr impurity energy level would be a separation center. In contrast, when the content of Zr was higher than its optimal level, Zr impurity energy level would be a recombination center.
The decrease in the band gap energy from 3.1 eV to 2.71 eV is supposed to be the main reason behind the substantial increase in photoactivity of Zr-doped titania (because of creation of new dopant levels). This also accounts for the fact that Zr-doped titania can respond to a greater fraction of light. The isomorphous substitution of Ti+4 by Zr4+ may lead to lattice expansion and thus ultimately lead to structural defects comprising Zr atoms and an oxygen vacancy in close proximity, which is energetically more favourable and cannot be ruled out as the main reason for increased photoactivity. Formation of structural defects comprising Zr atoms and an oxygen vacancy in close proximity can be shown with the help of the Kröger Vink notation in terms of the following chemical reaction:ZrO2 → ZrTi + V0 + O0 + ½O2Here ZrTi is the Zr ion at a Ti lattice site with a single charge deficiency. V0 is a doubly ionized oxygen vacancy while O0 is an oxygen ion in the normal lattice site where the concentration of the intrinsic defect V0 is equal to the concentration of the extrinsic impurities. There is an optimum value for photocatalytic activity related to the number of defects caused by the presence of dopants. A smaller number of defects (small Zr concentrations) can act as trapping centres to inhibit charge recombination and consequently improve the photocatalytic activity. However, if the number of defects is too high, the rate of charge combination will increase because the distances between the separating electrons and holes are too small resulting in a decreased number of effective charge carriers. Therefore, the optimum value is a balance between an increased number of trapping sites and fewer carriers resulting in longer lifetimes for interfacial charge transfer. In our case 0.5 mol% Zr was the best amount for photocatalytic activity with a degradation of almost 62% of quinalphos in 90 minutes.
Discussion
A series of Zr-doped titania photocatalysts have been prepared by using the acid catalysed sol–gel process. The zirconium doping showed a significant effect on the texture structure, band gap and thermal stability. The photoactivity of the undoped and doped titania obtained by the degradation experiments of the quinalphos solution established that 0.5% Zr doped TiO2 annealed at 500 °C is a better catalyst. The activity was found to be superior to that of the commercial TiO2 sample. The activity is dependent on both the structural and textural characteristics of titania, evolved as a result of doping. It was determined that the optimum amount of Zr-doping has a number of advantages over undoped as well as commercial titania but excess dopant reduces the efficiencies of catalysts. The formed modified TiO2 nanostructured materials had smaller band gap, smaller crystallite size, adequate surface area and greater thermal stability, which are all desirable features for catalysts, support materials, semiconductors, and electrodes in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC).
