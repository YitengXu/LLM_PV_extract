    , Accepted 24th October 2019First published on 25th October 2019AbstractDifferent from the traditional concept of donor–acceptor (D–A) structures, the newly reported design strategy of acceptor1–acceptor2 (A1–A2) type copolymers has been regarded as an efficient approach to boost the open circuit voltage (Voc) of organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, three A1–A2 type copolymers PBDD-BTZ-1, PBDD-BTZ-2 and PBDD-BTZ-3 with a 1,3-bis(thiophen-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo-[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD) derivative as the A1 unit and fluorine substituted benzotriazole (FTAZ) as the A2 unit are prepared for OSCs. Subtle modification on the side chain and π-bridge is found to cause a big difference on the photoelectric properties and the resulting device performance of these new double A copolymers. A deep HOMO level of −5.63 eV with an extremely small driving force of 0.06 eV is found to be obtained by the PBDD-BTZ-3 copolymer. As a result, an impressive Voc of 1.09 eV is obtained when it was blended with an ITIC-Th acceptor. On the other hand, the best device performance is achieved by the PBDD-BTZ-2 copolymer among these copolymers, due to its most favorable morphology. These results suggest that A1–A2 type copolymers can enrich the types of donor materials and will open a new possibility for developing efficient copolymers to boost the Voc of OSCs with a small driving force by reasonable combination of different electron-deficient blocks.
1. Introduction
During the last three decades, organic solar cells (OSCs) based on bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) structures have attracted increasing attention, owing to their great advantages of being inexpensive, light weight, and compatible with flexible large-area printing. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 16% has been achieved.1–8 The significant progress made in the field of OSCs is not only related to the development of photosensitive active materials, but also inseparable from the morphological optimization of photoactive layers.9,10 However, the PCE of the state-of-art OSCs is still far lower than those of other photovoltaic devices such as c-Si and perovskite cells. Recently, great efforts have been devoted to developing fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) and wide band gap (WBG) polymer donors to improve the device performance.
Designing WBG polymer donor materials to achieve good complementary absorption with the FREAs for improving the short-circuit current density (Jsc) of the OSCs is very crucial. Generally, the development of WBG polymer donor materials is usually based on a traditional donor–acceptor (D–A) alternating structure, which is composed of an electron-rich unit such as benzodithiophene (BDT) and an electron-deficient unit such as benzotriazole, 1,3-bis(thiophen-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo-[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD), carboxylated thiophene derivatives etc.11–13 To date, there are only a few electron-rich blocks developed to construct D–A type copolymers, and most D–A copolymer donors are based on BDT donor blocks, which restricts the diversification of the donor materials. Besides, another big problem of the D–A copolymers is that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of most BDT-based traditional D–A type polymers (5.2–5.4 eV) are not low enough to maximize the open-circuit voltage (Voc), when blended with FREAs with deep lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels.14–19 On the other hand, downshift of the HOMO levels always leads to the reduction of the HOMO offset (ΔEHOMO) between the donor and the acceptor, which would not provide sufficient driving force for exciton splitting, thus resulting in a decreased short-circuit current density (Jsc). Therefore, developing conductive copolymers with both deep HOMO and small driving force (ΔEHOMO less than 0.3 eV) is very desirable.
Recently, our group successfully created a novel strategy to construct an acceptor1–acceptor2 (A1–A2) architecture of polymer donors by introducing two “pull” electron-deficient units (A1 and A2).20,21 Such A1–A2 copolymers possess more electron-deficient units than D–A copolymers, thus, multi-electron deficient units in the A1–A2 type polymers can effectively down-shift the HOMO levels to 5.4–5.6 eV, which should be an effective way to improve the Voc of the OSCs. In addition, due to the abundant commercial acceptor blocks, the A1–A2 copolymer strategy can also enrich the polymer donor materials for OSCs by reasonable combination of different acceptor blocks. However, only a few A1–A2 type copolymers for OSCs have been reported, and the relationship between structure and properties is still unclear.
As we all know, the BDD unit is widely used in OSCs based on D–A architecture due to its high electron affinity, strong crystallinity and high coplanarity. Besides, the BDD unit can red-shift the absorption peak and the absorption edge efficiently due to the introduction of hydrogen bonds to facilitate better π–π stacking and backbone ordering.22–24 In addition, the fluorine substituted benzotriazole (FTAZ) unit has also been reported as an efficient building block for constructing high performance donor materials. Many studies have demonstrated that FTAZ shows strong aggregation in solution and strong π–π stacking in a solid film, thereby achieving high charge mobility.25–28 Herein, fusing the advantages of BDD and FTAZ, we designed and synthesized three novel copolymers based on A1–A2 architecture with different side chains and π-bridges, namely PBDD-BTZ-1, PBDD-BTZ-2 and PBDD-BTZ-3 (Scheme 1). These A1–A2 copolymers are composed of a BDD derivative unit as the A1 unit and a FTAZ unit as the A2 unit. Therefore, a deep HOMO level of −5.63 eV with an extremely small driving force of 0.06 eV has been obtained by the new double A copolymers. An impressive Voc of 1.09 eV is obtained by the PBDD-BTZ-3-based devices. In addition, the effect of the side chain and π-bridge engineering on the photoelectric properties and the resulting device performance of the three novel copolymers has also been systematically investigated.

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis of the A1–A2 copolymers
The chemical structures of the three A1–A2 copolymers PBDD-BTZ-1, PBDD-BTZ-2, PBDD-BTZ-3 are displayed in Scheme 1. The detailed synthetic routes of the three A1–A2 copolymer donors are described in the ESI (Scheme S1†). These copolymers were synthesized by the Stille coupling of the electron-deficient BDD derivative monomer (A1) with the electron-deficient FTAZ monomer (A2) under nitrogen and anhydrous conditions. In addition, the side chain and π-bridge engineering strategy is used to ensure sufficient solubility of the copolymers and regulate the molecular packing as well. The molecular weights of all the copolymers were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using tetrahydrofuran as the solvent. The average molecular weights  of PBDD-BTZ-1, PBDD-BTZ-2 and PBDD-BTZ-3 are 32 kDa, 49 kDa and 38 kDa with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.5, 1.7 and 2.3, respectively. The weight–temperature curves of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) are shown in Fig. S1.† The decomposition temperatures (Td) at 5% weight loss of the three copolymers are 381 °C, 409 °C and 400 °C, respectively (detailed parameters in Table 1), showing high thermal stability for OSC devices.

2.2. Geometry analysis by density functional theory calculation
To study the torsional profiles between the BDD (A1) unit and FTAZ (A2) unit, minimum energy conformation and frontier orbital structures of these polymers, theoretical calculations were performed by density functional theory (DFT) using at B3LYP/6-31g level (substitution of a side chain with a methyl group for all the structures). As shown in Fig. 1, PBDD-BTZ-3 displays larger torsional angles between the A1 and A2 units than PBDD-BTZ-1 or PBDD-BTZ-2, indicating greater steric hindrance between the A1 and A2 units in PBDD-BTZ-3. In contrast, after introducing thiophene rings into the backbone of PBDD-BTZ-1 and PBDD-BTZ-2, the torsional angles between the A1 and A2 units of both copolymers can be reduced distinctly. The side views suggest that all the copolymers have a planar conformation, and PBDD-BTZ-1 and PBDD-BTZ-2 reveal a better planar conformation than PBDD-BTZ-3, which is favorable for charge transport. Besides, due to the double A structure, the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) levels of these copolymers exhibit low HOMO and LUMO energy levels. All the detailed data are shown in Fig. 1.

2.3. Absorption spectra and electronic energy levels of the polymers

Fig. 2 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of these copolymers and the small molecular non-fullerene acceptor ITIC-Th in neat films. The detailed parameters are described in Table 1. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the three copolymer solutions and their corresponding films blended with ITIC-Th acceptor are shown in ESI Fig. S2a and b.† All these polymer donors have well-defined absorption peaks with vibronic shoulders, which indicates the existence of strong interchain aggregation and π–π transition in the solid films. From the normalized absorption spectra of these copolymers in Fig. 2a we can see that, subtle modification on the bridge and side chain caused a big difference in the UV-vis absorption spectra of these copolymers. Comparing the UV profiles of PBDD-BTZ-1 and PBDD-BTZ-2 with the same backbone, introducing the branched alkyl chain into the thiophene ring can effectively improve the molecular packing, as revealed by the red-shifted absorption by 30 nm and the remarkably enhanced shoulder peak in the spectrum of PBDD-BTZ-2. The maximum extinction coefficient of PBDD-BTZ-2 is also higher than that of PBDD-BTZ-1 (5.4 × 104vs. 4.5 × 104 cm−1), as shown in Fig. 2b. Unexpectedly, the polymer PBDD-BTZ-3 has the most twisted backbone, but displays the strongest shoulder peak in the long wavelength, indicating the strongest interchain aggregation in the copolymer. The longest branched alkyl chain in the A1 unit may favor the most compact interchain packing in PBDD-BTZ-3. Such strong interchain aggregation induces an obvious hyperchromic effect in the absorption spectrum, resulting in the maximum molar extinction coefficient up to 7.1 × 104 cm−1.

To further investigate the molecular aggregation of these copolymers, the temperature-dependent aggregation absorption spectra (Td-Abs) of the copolymer donors have been recorded as shown in Fig. 3. The self-aggregation properties of all the copolymers were determined in chlorobenzene (0.2 mg ml−1) solution. As shown in Fig. 3a, when the solution starts cooling from 90 to 25 °C, copolymer PBDD-BTZ-1 only shows a negligible temperature-dependent aggregation effect. However, PBDD-BTZ-2 and PBDD-BTZ-3 exhibit a distinct temperature-dependent aggregation effect, which is demonstrated as an effective protocol self-aggregation property for film-state stacking. For PBDD-BTZ-2 solution (see Fig. 3b), at high temperature (90 °C), an absorption peak is observed at 515 nm. In the cooling process, the maximum absorption peak gradually increases and red-shifts to the long wavelength. When the solution cooled to room temperature, a shoulder peak appears at 602 nm, close to that in the thin film. In addition, PBDD-BTZ-3 shows much more pronounced temperature-dependent aggregation properties than PBDD-BTZ-2 (Fig. 3c). When the PBDD-BTZ-3 solution cooled to 25 °C, the maximum absorption peak also increases and red-shifts by ∼70 nm. Note that the absorption shoulder peaks can be observed during the whole cooling process for PBDD-BTZ-3 solution, even at high temperature (90 °C). In fact, too strong temperature-dependent aggregation is also not favorable for developing well-defined heterojunction morphology (discussed later).

From the absorption edges of these copolymers, the corresponding optical bandgap (Eoptg) is 1.81 eV for PBDD-BTZ-1, 1.79 eV for PBDD-BTZ-2 and 1.87 eV for PBDD-BTZ-3, suggesting that all the copolymers are wide-band gap copolymer donors. As seen from Fig. 2a, all these copolymers show complementary light absorption with the ITIC-Th FREA. The energy levels of these copolymers were further measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The detailed parameters are provided in Fig. 2c and CV curves are displayed in Fig. 2d. The HOMO energy levels of these copolymers are calculated to be −5.35 eV for PBDD-BTZ-1, −5.43 eV for PBDD-BTZ-2 and −5.63 eV for PBDD-BTZ-3, and −5.69 eV for ITIC-Th. The LUMO energy levels are calculated to be −3.48 eV, −3.50 eV and −3.52 eV for PBDD-BTZ-1, PBDD-BTZ-2 and PBDD-BTZ-3, respectively, and −3.85 eV for ITIC-Th. The energy levels of ITIC-Th are consistent with the results from the literature.29 In addition, it can be found that slightly changing the side chain and π-bridge impacts greatly on the energy levels of the resulting copolymer films, especially on the HOMO levels. This should be ascribed to the variation on the film morphology of these copolymers. The smallest loading of thiophene bridges and most compact molecular aggregation contribute to the lowest HOMO level of PBDD-BTZ-3. The deep HOMO levels are expected to boost the Voc of the resulting devices. The HOMO energy levels are also consistent with the FMO levels based on DFT calculations. Besides, the HOMO offset between the copolymer and the ITIC-Th acceptor (ΔEHOMO) of PBDD-BTZ-1, PBDD-BTZ-2 and PBDD-BTZ-3 are calculated to be 0.34 eV, 0.26 eV and 0.06 eV, respectively, while the ΔELUMO value are calculated to be 0.37 eV, 0.35 eV and 0.33 eV, respectively.
2.4 Photovoltaic properties
To study the photovoltaic properties of these copolymers blended with the ITIC-Th FREA, OSC devices with a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:ITIC-Th/PDINO/Al were fabricated. We have changed different optimized conditions of OSC device fabrication such as the processing solvents, the polymer donor/ITIC-Th FREA (D/A) ratio, thermal annealing temperature and time, and different additives to optimize the performance of the devices. The optimized device parameters are provided in Table 2. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 4a. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves are displayed in Fig. 4b. Three copolymer-based devices with 0.5% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) exhibit relatively higher photovoltaic performance than those without the DIO additive. Among these copolymers, PBDD-BTZ-1 shows the lowest PCE values of 4.6% and 3.7% with and without the additive, respectively. Both PBDD-BTZ-2 and PBDD-BTZ-3 deliver dramatically improved device performance with all enhanced device parameters. The best device with PBDD-BTZ-2 shows a PCE of 8.4%, a Voc of 0.94 V, a Jsc of 13.2 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.68. For PBDD-BTZ-3, the best device yields a high Voc of 1.07 V, a Jsc of 11.9 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.57, leading to a PCE of 7.3%. Due to the deep HOMO levels, both PBDD-BTZ-3 and PBDD-BTZ-2 achieve a high Voc. In the devices, the energy loss (Eloss) (Eloss = Eoptg − qVoc, where Eoptg is the optical bandgap and q is the charge element) is the key to obtain a high Voc value. According to the Eoptg (1.61 eV) of ITIC-Th, and the Voc values of these devices, the corresponding Eloss values are 0.78 eV, 0.65 eV and 0.52 eV for PBDD-BTZ-1, PBDD-BTZ-2 and PBDD-BTZ-3-based devices, respectively. Note that the Eloss of a PBDD-BTZ-3:ITIC-Th-based device is lower than the empirical limit value of 0.6 eV. Such small Eloss in the device is benefitted from the small ΔEHOMO of 0.06 eV between PBDD-BTZ-3 and ITIC-Th.

In addition, due to the better morphology developed by temperature-dependent aggregation in PBDD-BTZ-3 and PBDD-BTZ-2 than in PBDD-BTZ-1, the Jsc and FF values are also enhanced. Surprisingly, PBDD-BTZ-3 with the highest molar extinction coefficient and strongest interchain aggregation did not obtain the best Jsc and FF. The EQE was measured to detect the photo-current conversion. It can be found that the Jsc values from the J–V curves are consistent with those from the EQE profiles (see Fig. 4b). In the EQE curves, all the devices show a wide photo-response ranging from 320 to 800 nm. In particular, PBDD-BTZ-2:ITIC-Th with 0.5% DIO achieves the highest EQE value in the 595 to 755 nm region without or with 0.5% DIO, responsible for the highest Jsc value. However, PBDD-BTZ-3 with the strongest light absorption does not achieve a higher EQE value than PBDD-BTZ-2, leading to a lower Jsc value.
2.5 Charge dissociation, recombination and transport characteristics
Dissociation of charge-transfer states is a crucial factor for the device performance. Due to the deep HOMO levels of these copolymers, ΔEHOMO values of PBDD-BTZ-1, PBDD-BTZ-2 and PBDD-BTZ-3 with ITIC-Th are calculated to be 0.34 eV, 0.27 eV and 0.06 eV, respectively. For PBDD-BTZ-2 and PBDD-BTZ-3, ΔEHOMO is much lower than the typical value of 0.3 eV required for efficient charge dissociation.30 Therefore, to evaluate the charge dissociation in the active blend films, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiment was performed. The excitation wavelengths of PBDD-BTZ-1, PBDD-BTZ-2, PBDD-BTZ-3 and the acceptor ITIC-Th pure films are 560, 580, 610 and 700 nm, respectively, and their corresponding emission maximum peaks are at 690, 680 and 655 nm, 765 nm, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5a, for the polymer:ITIC-Th blend films, the emissions of donor materials are almost quenched by over 85% for PBDD-BTZ-1, 98% for PBDD-BTZ-2 (seen in Fig. 5b) and 93% for PBDD-BTZ-3 (see Fig. 5c), suggesting effective electron transfer from the polymer donor to ITIC-Th. In addition, when changing the excitation wavelength to 700 nm, the emissions of ITIC-Th for all the blend films are also quenched completely. It is inferred that in these A1–A2 copolymers, an extremely small driving force (ΔEHOMO less than 0.3 eV, even as low as 0.06 eV) is still enough for efficient hole transfer. Such a small driving force can diminish the trade-off between Voc and Jsc, which is very desirable for OSCs.

As mentioned above, PBDD-BTZ-3 with the highest molar extinction coefficient and strongest interchain aggregation did not obtain the best Jsc and FF. To further determine the charge recombination and charge transport in these active layers, the light intensity (Plight) dependence of Voc of the blend films was analyzed (Fig. 5d) and the space charge-limited current (SCLC) measurement was performed (Fig. S3† and Table 2). The charge recombination mechanism can be determined by Plight dependence of Voc measurement, which shows a linear relationship with a slope of kT/e. According to the Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination, a stronger dependence of Voc on the light intensity with a greater slope kT/e can be observed.31,32 As shown in Fig. 5d, PBDD-BTZ-2 (1.23kT/e) shows a smaller slope in comparison with PBDD-BTZ-1 (1.51kT/e) and PBDD-BTZ-3 (1.38kT/e), which suggests that PBDD-BTZ-2 has fewer trap-assisted recombination. Note that bimolecular recombination is more reduced in a PBDD-BTZ-2-based device than in a PBDD-BTZ-3-based one, accounting for the lower FF of the PBDD-BTZ-3-based device. Fig. S3† shows the plots of J1/2–Vappl measured by the SCLC method. The results are summarized in Table 2. In the pristine blend films, the PBDD-BTZ-1:ITIC-Th blend film shows a hole mobility (μh) of 1.13 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron motility (μe) value of 0.94 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. After introducing a side chain into the thiophene bridge, the μh and μe values of the PBDD-BTZ-2:ITIC-Th blend film are improved to 1.30 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.12 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The improved charge mobilities of PBDD-BTZ-2 should be ascribed to the improved molecular ordering favored by side-chain engineering. Moreover, both the μh and μe values are even higher than those in PBDD-BTZ-3 (μh = 1.24 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe = 1.02 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). This is because too strong interchain aggregation of PBDD-BTZ-3 results in a less favorable morphology of the bulk heterojunction (discussed later). With 0.5% DIO additive, the charge mobilities of all blend films are enhanced. The PBDD-BTZ-2:ITIC-Th blend film shows the highest mobilities among these blends (μh = 1.43 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe = 1.22 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Apparently, the highest charge carrier mobilities of PBDD-BTZ-2:ITIC-Th are consistent with its highest Jsc value. In addition, the PBDD-BTZ-2:ITIC-Th blend film shows the most balanced μe/μh value compared to the other counterparts, contributing to the reduced charge recombination. As a result, the best Jsc and FF values are achieved for the device with PBDD-BTZ-2:ITIC-Th, but not for the one with PBDD-BTZ-3:ITIC-Th.
2.6 Morphology characterization
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were carried out to investigate the morphology of the blend films, as displayed in Fig. 6 and 7. Fig. 6a–c show the images of the samples without additives, and the blend film of PBDD-BTZ-1:ITIC-Th shows a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 2.91. Side chain engineering on the thiophene bridge endows the PBDD-BTZ-2 blend film with a smoother surface and a smaller RMS roughness of 1.08. However, when prolonging the alkyl chain, but excluding two thiophene bridges in the BDD unit, PBDD-BTZ-3:ITIC-Th displayed the largest RMS of 3.61 among these blends, because of the strongest aggregation of PBDD-BTZ-3. After adding 0.5% DIO, the morphologies of all the blend films become more homogeneous (see Fig. 6d–f), and the most smooth surface is obtained for the PBDD-BTZ-2 blend film. The AFM phase images are shown in Fig. S4.† A similar phenomenon is also observed in the TEM images in Fig. 7a–f. The blends of PBDD-BTZ-1:ITIC-Th (Fig. 7a and d) and PBDD-BTZ-3:ITIC-Th (Fig. 7c and f) show large-scale aggregation domains of donors and acceptors. In contrast, the PBDD-BTZ-2 blend films form fibrillar networks with fine micro-phase separation, which is favorable for exciton dissociation and charge transport. Therefore, the finest film morphology of PBDD-BTZ-2 shows the highest Jsc and FF of OSC devices.

3. Conclusions
In conclusion, three copolymer donors based on A1–A2 architecture were designed and synthesized. Due to the BDD derivative and FTAZ unit with high electron affinity, all of the copolymers have a deep HOMO level, especially for PBDD-BTZ-3 possessing the lowest HOMO level of −5.63 eV. Side chain engineering and subtle optimization of the number of bridges effectively regulate planar geometry, molecular aggregation, energy level, bulk heterojunction morphology and the final device performance. For PBDD-BTZ-2:ITIC-Th, as a result of the suitable morphology, the highest PCE of 8.4% is obtained. On the other hand, the PBDD-BTZ-3:ITIC-Th-based device obtained a notable Voc of 1.09 V. Note that an extremely low driving force for efficient exciton dissociation is found in PBDD-BTZ-3:ITIC-Th, which is very desirable for high performance OSCs. Although the device performance of these new copolymers in this work still lags behind those of the state-of-art devices, these results still reveal that these A1–A2 type copolymers can enrich the donor materials and will open a new possibility for developing efficient copolymers to boost the Voc of OSCs with a small driving force by reasonable combination of different acceptor blocks.
