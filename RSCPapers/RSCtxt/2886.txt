    , Accepted 2nd June 2019First published on 3rd June 2019AbstractEffective exploitation of visible-light unique structural and electronic properties has enormously attracted more researchers for photocatalytic systems. Here, we have fabricated an efficient Bi2WO6-Ag plasmonic hybrid via the photoreduction technique and the obtained materials were well characterized with sophisticated instruments. The BW-Ag-1 catalyst showed the maximum photocatalytic activity for the degradation of cationic dyes rhodamine B (RhB) and malachite green (MG) and the rate constant was 2.6 × 10−2 min−1 and 1.6 × 10−2 min−1 respectively, which is the highest among the synthesized catalysts. The enhanced photocatalytic activity could be ascribed to the synergistic effect of surface plasmon resonance caused by Ag NPs, which could enhance the photoabsorption capability, photon scattering, and plasmon resonance energy transfer, and plasmon-induced hot electron transfer (PHET) ensures better photocatalytic performance. In addition, we have evaluated the influence of Ag on Bi2WO6 microspheres with crystallographic and morphological studies, which depict a negligible change in the crystal structure and an increase in the Ag (FCC) phase with an increase in AgNO3 content and the FE-SEM and mapping images disclose the uniform dispersion of Ag on the surface of Bi2WO6. Trapping experiments revealed that the active species for the degradation of MG were superoxide (˙O2−) radicals as the major reactive species with holes being the main instigative species, which are effectively involved in the photo-induced catalytic reaction. Furthermore, we have studied the effect of different pH of MG initial solution and the plasmonic hybrid catalyst depicted high stability and durability even after five successive cycles. In the electrochemical study, the BW-Ag-1 modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) demonstrated a superior current density due to the redox behavior and smaller resistance revealing the addition of Ag NPs to be beneficial for the catalytic performance.
1. Introduction
Heterogeneous photocatalysis has been used as a splendid tactic for environmental remediation because it represents an economical and green methodology to decompose hazardous organic contaminants as well as shows great potential for the conversion of solar energy into chemical energy.1–3 In general, heterogeneous photocatalysts are solid semiconductors, which are fundamentally categorized by researchers via five key aspects namely low cost, harmlessness, band gap potential (eV) of the ECB minimum and EVB maximum and a large surface with charge carrier dynamics i.e. mobility, diffusion length and lifetime of the photoinduced e− and h+.3,4 Here, TiO2 is used as an essential component for decomposition of organic contaminants and solar energy conversion for fuel generation.1,5 In 1972 Fujishima and Honda discovered photoinduced water splitting performed via a single crystal n-type TiO2 anode semiconductor.6 In spite of its superior characteristics, TiO2 is unable to exploit visible light due to its wide band gap of 3.2 eV, which can harvest only 4% of solar energy; meanwhile, the poor lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers of TiO2 limits its applications.7,8
Hence, the development of high functionality catalysts has emerged as one of the pioneering research areas for energy conversion and organic decomposition. Among various catalytic materials, bismuth(III) containing binary metal oxide semiconductors (Bi2MoO6, BiVO4, Bi4Ti3O12, Bi12TiO20, Bi2Ti2O7, Bi2WO6 and etc.)9–12 belong to a unique category, which posses substantial interesting properties due to their low cost, non-toxicity, high stability and excellent optical, electrical, and chemical properties which lead to better catalytic activity.1,13 Among this family of materials, n-type Bi2WO6 has attracted extensive interest for photoelectrocatalysis due to its stimulating physical and chemical properties of non-linear dielectric susceptibility, ferroelectric piezoelectricity, electron mobility, and catalytic behavior.2,14 Bi2WO6 is one of the simplest Aurivillius structures (An−1BnO3n+1). It is composed of perovskite slabs of WO6 octahedral units, which are perpendicular to the (100) direction sandwiched between the bismuth oxide (Bi2O2)2+ layers. This nature of arrangement favors effective separation of photoinduced charge carriers (h+/e−), which could be recognized by the formation of an internal electric field between the layers,14 turning out to have higher efficiency compared to TiO2 under visible light illumination.4 The conduction band (ECB) and valence band (EVB) of Bi2WO6 are composed of the W 6s orbitals and hybridized O 2p and Bi 6s orbitals, which may cause the upshift of EVBs. Hence, a larger value of EVB leads to a narrowed band gap (2.78 eV), and also it favors the greater mobility of photo-induced holes for photooxidation.4,14,15 Mostly, the energy bands are made up of individual atoms with partially filled orbitals.16 Nevertheless, the photoabsorption range of Bi2WO6 is shorter than ∼476 nm and it also suffers from faster recombination of photoinduced charge carriers hindering its photocatalytic application.17–19 In order to resolve this problem several efforts have been endeavored in the past such as coupling with other semiconductors,20 graphitic materials,21 QDs22 and doping with metals,17 nonmetals23 and so on. In contrast, surface modification with noble metals (Au, Ag, Pt, and Cu)24 has attracted a great deal of interest since they can effectively boost the photoabsorption capability, emission, Raman scattering, and nonlinear optical properties.25 Moreover, lifetime of the photo-induced charge carrier can be improved via Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) and the formation of a Schottky barrier between the metal and n-type semiconductor. SPR is an oscillation of conduction electrons on the metal surface by the electromagnetic field through the redistribution of the charge density and electric field, hence it can improve the photoabsorption capability, which depends on the size of the metal particle26 and could enhance the efficiency of the BW through three interesting aspects which are photons scattering around the BW semiconductor, energy transfer from plasmonic Ag to the receiver BW and hot electron generation by the metal.27–29 Furthermore, to prevent the faster recombination of e− and h+, Schottky barrier creation at the interface of the metal and semiconductor induces electrons being trapped by the metal, whereas holes are freely involved in the photocatalytic reaction.30,31 Furthermore, the photocatalytic activity was tested on the degradation of cationic dyes, rhodamine B (RhB) as a model dye pollutant from the textile industry32 and malachite green (MG), which is a highly controversial dye extensively used in fisheries as it can affect fish or shrimp instigating carcinogenicity and genotoxicity, which may be harmful to humans entering via our food chain.33,34 Besides, cyclic voltammetry has been a helpful technique to probe the electron transfer in catalytic reactions within a controlled potential region. The experimental current density at the anodic and cathodic regions corresponds to the oxidation and reduction capability of the material, which is mainly ascribed to the facilitation of electron transfer.
Herein, we have obtained Bi2WO6/Ag plasmonic hybrids via the photoreduction route. The introduction of silver (Ag) is to facilitate a higher efficiency of the photoreaction, by expanding the light absorption and improving the lifetime of the photoinduced charge carriers. Competency of the photocatalytic activity was assessed over the degradation of RhB and MG cationic dyes under light illumination. The BW-Ag-1 hybrid plasmonic catalyst exhibited a degradation rate of 2.6 × 10−2 min−1 and 1.6 × 10−2 min−1 for RhB and MG respectively, which is the highest efficiency among the synthesized materials. Furthermore, the synergistic interaction, crystal, structural, optical, luminescence properties, and electrochemical performance were interpreted based on the appropriate experimental results.
2. Experiments
2.1. Synthesis of Bi2WO6/Ag plasmonic hybrids
All the chemical reagents were analytical grade and used without further purification. Deionized (DI) water was used in all experiments. Bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O) was purchased from Strem chemicals UK Ltd. Sodium tungstate dihydrate (Na2WO4·2H2O) was bought from Alfa Aesar and silver nitrate (AgNO3) was obtained from AENCORE chemicals Co., Ltd. Rhodamine B (RhB) and malachite green (MG) dyes were purchased from Loba Chemie Pvt Ltd. Sodium hydroxide was obtained from Merck Chemicals Pvt. Ltd and nitric acid (HNO3) was bought from Shmakyu's pure chemicals.
The Bi2WO6 catalyst was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal route. Briefly, 1.4552 g (3 mmol) of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O was dissolved in 40 mL of 0.5 M HNO3 solution with vigorous stirring and 0.4947 g (1.5 mmol) of 25 mL aqueous Na2WO4·2H2O solution was poured into the above mixture under continuous stirring. After 30 minutes of stirring, suspensions were transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, loaded into a furnace and heated at 170 °C for 20 h. The autoclave was later allowed to cool down to room temperature naturally and the derived precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed with DI water and ethanol several times, dried in an oven at 75 °C overnight and annealed at 400 °C for 3 h. The Bi2WO6/Ag (BW-Ag) plasmonic hybrids were obtained via a photoreduction method. 100 mL of de-ionized water was added to the photoreduction reaction vessel (Fig. S1†) and an appropriate amount of prepared Bi2WO6 (1 mmol) was dispersed in AgNO3 in a certain concentration. Subsequently, the suspension was irradiated with a 300 W Xe lamp for 2 h under continuous magnetic stirring (600 rpm). The temperature of the reaction vessel was maintained at 25 °C by using a water circulation system. During the reaction, the color of the solution changed from creamy white to dark-gray indicating the reduction of silver ions (Ag+) to silver metal (Ag) on the Bi2WO6 surface. Afterwards, the materials were separated through centrifugation and washed with DI water and ethanol repeatedly until the complete removal of nitrates (NO3−) and adsorbed silver (Ag+) ions. Finally, it was dried at 75 °C overnight. The concentrations of AgNO3 used herein were 0.5 mmol, 1 mmol and 1.5 mmol. The resulting samples were labeled as BW-Ag-0.5, BW-Ag-1, and BW-Ag-1.5 based on the amount of AgNO3 used.
2.2. Characterization studies
Powder X-ray diffraction (P-XRD; Rigaku D/Max-II with Cu Kα radiation λ = 0.15406 nm) was used to examine the crystalline phase of the samples. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) of the samples dispersed in a KBr solid to make a transparent pellet was performed with a PerkinElmer Spectrum. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi 3400N and Carl Zeiss) and TEM (JEOL JEM-3010) were conducted to get a morphological image of the prepared catalysts. Elemental mapping was studied by using an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) equipped with a FE-SEM instrument. The light absorption ability of the catalyst was examined via UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy measurements carried out on a Jasco V-600 equipped with an integrating sphere. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and pore distribution size of the materials were measured by (Quantochrome autosorb 1) N2 adsorption analysis. The photoluminescence studies were performed by using a photoluminescence spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer LS 45). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements (XPS; VGS Thermo K-Alpha with Al Kα radiation as the excitation source) were performed to obtain the chemical state and composition of the catalyst surface.
2.3. Photocatalytic experiment
The photocatalytic properties of bare BW and BW-Ag plasmonic hybrids were investigated by the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) and malachite green (MG) in aqueous solution, and light energy was supplied by using a 300 W tungsten–halogen lamp (OSRAM). In each experiment, 0.02 g of the catalyst was dispersed into 50 mL of aqueous RhB solution (5 mg L−1) and aqueous MG solution (15 mg L−1). Prior to irradiation, the suspension was kept in the dark for 30 min under magnetic stirring to ensure the adsorption–desorption equilibrium between the dye and catalyst. Subsequently, light illumination was performed at a distance of 60–70 mm from the reaction tube and the temperature was maintained at room temperature by water circulating through the outer jacket of the lamp. After that, 3.5 mL of suspension was collected at regular time intervals during the irradiation and the dispersed catalyst was separated out via centrifugation from the solution. The temporal changes in RhB and MG concentrations were detected by employing a UV-Vis spectrophotometer in the maximum absorbance wavelength of 554 nm for RhB and 617 nm for MG.
Furthermore to classify the role of reactive species in this photodegradation, the radical scavenging experiment was conducted using several suitable scavengers such as isopropyl alcohol (IPA), EDTA-2Na, AgNO3, and p-BQ for trapping of OH˙,35 h+,36 e−,37 and ˙O2−,21 radicals were added in the photocatalytic system under identical reaction conditions over the BW-Ag-1 catalyst.
2.4. Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical properties of the samples were evaluated using a CH electrochemical workstation (CHI6273D), connected to a three-electrode system. A 3 mm dia glassy carbon electrode (GCE, well-polished with 0.05 micron alumina slurry) was used as the working electrode, platinum wire as the counter electrode to complete the electrical circuit, Ag/AgCl (3 M NaCl) as a reference electrode and 1 M H2SO4 aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte to conserve the electrical neutrality by the migration of ions in solution. The BW and BW-Ag-1 electrodes were prepared by adding dropwise 7 μL aqueous slurry that consisted of 5 mg of the prepared sample with 30 μL of Nafion (binder) and 0.97 mL of ethanol on the mirror polished GCE with uniform dispersion, and then it was allowed to dry naturally. The cyclic voltammogram (CV) was measured from −0.4 to 0.4 V with the scan rate of 50 mV s−1 and the BW-Ag-1/GCE performance was monitored by differential scan cyclic voltammetry with the potential of −0.3 to 0.4 V and varying the scan rates from 20 mV s−1 to 120 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out using the same three electrode system and electrolyte as mentioned above, the frequency range was from 100 kHz to 1 Hz, the bias potential was 0.01 V and the amplitude of the applied voltage was 0.005 V. All the electrochemical performances were monitored under dark conditions.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of Bi2WO6/Ag plasmonic hybrids
Pure BW was identified as the orthorhombic phase consistent with JCPDS No. 73-2020 with the B2ab space group shown in p-XRD (Fig. 1a). Most essentially, the cubic Ag phase was perceived while gradually increasing the Ag levels from 0.5% to 1.5% (Fig. 1b), corresponding to the face-centered cubic (FCC) with JCPDS. 04-0783, the distinct peaks at 37.76° and 43.95° were indexed to the (111) and (200) faces of Ag, which unambiguously indicated the co-existence of Ag and Bi2WO6 in the BW-Ag composition. Further convincing evidence is attained from a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis demonstrated in Fig. 1e–h. The ring pattern is consistent with hkl values and the interplaner spacing values are similar to the calculated values from p-XRD. Fig. 1f indicates that the Ag nanoparticles bound to the BW surface exhibit different sizes of about 240 nm and 142 nm. Fig. 1g and h display an enlarged view of BW nanoplatelets, which can be clearly corroborated with the FE-SEM images described in the later section. Furthermore, due to the incorporation of Ag species onto the BW structure, certain distortions and compressions were observed in the cell volume and lattice parameters (a ≠ b ≠ c). The crystallite size (Scherrer formula)38 is presented in Fig. 1d. The d-spacing of the high-intensity peak was calculated from Bragg's equation39 as shown in Fig. 1d. Here, the lattice strain (ε) on the XRD peak broadening has been analyzed from the plot of βcosθ and sinθ using the Williamson–Hall (W–H) equation,40,41, where β is the FWHM value of the distinct peak in radians, D is the average crystallite size, and ε is the lattice strain. The linear fit of the plotted data was used to calculate the lattice strain from the slope. The micro strain (ε) was found to slightly increase with the increase in Ag species on the Bi2WO6, as displayed in Fig. 1c. According to the Williamson–Smallman relationship,42 the dislocation densities (δ) of the materials have been determined as the length of dislocation lines per unit volume of the crystal which was evaluated by the following formula. δ = 1/D2 where D is the average crystallite size, the dislocation density was detected in the range of 4.1191 to 6.3088 × 10−3 respectively and the observed δ values were significantly increased with the introduction of Ag.

The microstructural investigation of catalysts was performed using FE-SEM. Fig. 2a presents the pure BW catalyst, which appears like hierarchical microspheres gathered with plenty of nanoplatelets is associated with structural growth of nucleation, self-aggregation, oriented attachment and Oswald ripening with the blending of grain boundaries prominent to a larger particle size is about 5–8 μm (Scheme 1). The thickness of a single platelet was determined to be around 30.93 nm (Fig. S2†). Compared with pure BW, the BW-Ag composition exhibits no changes in the structural morphology obviously, however the surface of the BW catalyst is consistently disseminated by Ag NPs (Fig. 2b–d) and the apparent plate-like two dimensional Ag species width was calculated to be 117 nm (Fig. S2†) which is achieved directly by the photoreduction route. An EDX spectrum was acquired to examine the elemental composition of the BW-Ag-1 catalyst, which confirms the existence of the expected elements Bi, W, O, and Ag (Fig. 2i). Furthermore elemental mapping confirms the elemental distribution (Fig. 2e–h), which clearly specifies the Ag particles uniformly dispersed onto the surface of BW.

The surface elemental state of the catalyst was obtained by XPS analysis shown in Fig. 3a–e. The survey scan spectrum of the BW and BW-Ag-1 catalysts shows the characteristic peaks of Bi, W, and O elements, and also C element located at 284.6 eV, which belongs to adventitious carbon. Strikingly we would like to mention that the Ag peaks were found in the survey spectrum, which also is exceptional evidence for the presence of Ag in the catalyst. Fig. 3b–e disclose the high-resolution spectra of Bi 4f, W 4f, O 1s, and Ag 3d, respectively. From Fig. 3b two distinct peaks of the BW-Ag-1 sample located at 159.11 eV and 164.42 eV for the spin–orbit splitting of Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 are observed, which indicates that the Bi element is present in the most stable trivalent (Bi3+) oxidation state in [Bi2O2]2+.43 Likewise, the doublet peaks spotted at 35.39 eV and 37.50 eV in BW-Ag-1 correspond to the W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2 (Fig. 3c), which can be analogous to the W6+ chemical state in [WO4]2−.44 The O 1s core-level spectrum of BW-Ag-1 can be deconvoluted into two peaks appearing at 529.92 eV and 530.92 eV which are ascribed to the lattice oxygen (Olatt) in Bi–O, W–O bonds and the adsorbed oxygen (Oads) from the atmosphere, respectively32 (Fig. 3d). In comparison with BW, the BE of BW-Ag-1 shifted towards the lower BE region owing to the interfacial chemical interaction and change in the chemical environment (Fig. S3a–c†). Fig. 3e depicts the spectra of Ag 3d signals which had peaks located at 367.84 eV and 373.83 eV attributed to the Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 of spin–orbit splitting. This suggests that the silver dominantly formed in the metallic state and not in the +1 oxidation state in the BW-Ag-1 catalyst.45 The splitting of the 3d doublet is around 6 eV and there are no peaks present above 374 eV further validating our assertion that silver is present in the metallic form Ag.46 In addition, Fig. S3e† reveals the relative atomic percentage of the elements Bi 4f, W 4f, O 1s, and Ag 3d in the BW-Ag-1 catalyst. Finally, the density of the valence band state was measured by VB XPS.47 The energy gap (eV) was measured between the valence band and the Fermi level, not the optical band gap energy. The valence band of BW and BW-Ag-1 was approximately at ∼1.95 eV and ∼1.87 eV respectively (Fig. S3d†). This VB energy shift towards lower BE could be attributed to the strong interaction between the Ag and BW, respectively.

For further chemical composition and bonding evaluation, FT-IR spectroscopy was employed (Fig. S5†). For pure BW, the main characteristic bands were observed at 400–1000 cm−1 attributed to the stretching and bridging stretching vibrations of Bi–O, W–O and W–O–W bands.48,49 The band at 569 cm−1 corresponds to the Bi–O bending vibration50 and the absorption peaks at 731 cm−1 and 825 cm−1 are assigned to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of W–O.50,51 Furthermore O–H peaks were observed at 1630 cm−1 and 3415 cm−1 which could be attributable to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of water molecules adsorbed by the material itself.50–52 The spectra of pure BW and BW-Ag are similar in nature, corroborating the fact that Ag incorporation did not bring any distortions in the bonding states of BW.
The photoabsorption ability of the catalyst plays a pivotal role in photocatalytic enhancement. Noticeably, the color of the sample changed from creamy white to dark gray with the increase in the dosage of Ag, which points towards strong visible light absorption occurring in the BW-Ag plasmonic hybrids. From Fig. 4a, bare BW microspheres display photoabsorption ranging from 400 to 500 nm owing to the intrinsic semiconductor behavior, which obviously has a weaker capability to harvest larger amounts of visible light. The observed absorption peaks are deconvoluted via peak fitting and the range of energy at 5.85 eV (212 nm), 4.67 eV (348 nm) and 3.47 eV (401) for intrinsic BW semiconductor is shown in Fig. S4.† Once accompanied by Ag in the BW-Ag plasmonic hybrids, the visible light absorption ability was enhanced corresponding to the synergetic conjunction of BW and Ag. Furthermore, a shoulder peak was observed for the BW-Ag-1 catalyst with a higher absorption intensity at ca. ∼525 nm ascribed to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of Ag,53 which can be seen from Fig. 4a and the observed resonance peak strongly depends on the size of the Ag metal. The SPR absorption in the Ag species arises from the collective oscillations of the free conduction band (ECB) electrons that are enriched through the incident electromagnetic radiation (EMR),54 on account of this so-called surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The exchange of ionic charge between the SPR band and atomic orbitals of surroundings could favour the excited state, therefore it can get involved in the photoreactions.30 The energy bandgap of the samples was determined based on the Tauc plot of (αhv)rversus hv (eV) from the DRS data, where α is the absorption coefficient, h is the Planck constant, v is the light frequency and r is determined by the type of optical transition, such as r = 2 for an indirect transition and r = 1/2 for a direct transition.36 Herein, for the BW-Ag plasmonic hybrids, r is defined to be an indirect transition (r = 2).55 The energy band gap of BW, BW-Ag-0.5, BW-Ag-1, and BW-Ag-1.5 catalysts was found to be 2.78 eV, 2.60 eV, 2.26 eV and 2.08, eV by estimating the intercept of the tangent to the abscissa axis (Fig. 4b). In view of this phenomenon, the photocatalytic activity of BW-Ag plasmonic hybrids can be assumed to be excellent in comparison with that of bare BW.
 Fig. 4  UV-Vis DRS photoabsorption spectrum (a), band gap (b), photoluminescence spectra (c), and Gaussian fit PL spectra of BW (d). 
In contrast, the room temperature PL spectra of BW and various contents of Ag loaded BW (0.5, 1 and 1.5) samples with the excitation wavelength at 320 nm are presented in Fig. 4c, the emission peaks of BW are de-convoluted into four prominent peaks by the peak fitting (Gaussian) as shown in Fig. 4d. The lower emission peak was observed in the UV region of ∼385 nm (violet) due to the near band edge emission or emission due to the excitonic recombination56 and the prominently visible region peaks at ∼457 nm (blue) are attributed to the inelastic Raman scattering17 and the visible region of ∼487 (sky-blue) and ∼527 nm (green) probably owing to the intrinsic or extrinsic defect related emissions. Apparently, the BW-Ag-1 photocatalyst intensity was significantly reduced compared with pure BW, which represents Ag NPs inducing a quenching of the PL intensity due to the higher life of photo-induced charge carriers (h+/e−). Understandably, the formation of a Schottky barrier between the metal (Ag) and n-type (BW) semiconductor can reduce the recombination of electron/hole pairs which will benefit the photoreactions by effectively trapping the electrons from the conduction band of BW thereby restraining the process of recombination. Basically, the frequent flow of electrons from the BW to Ag metal would be leading to equilibrium and/or attain the electrical neutrality at the interface, which creates an electron sink to escape the electron/hole recombination, as well as to extend the lifespan of the reactive species (e−) leading to a high range of activity when using the metal/semiconductor interfaces under light irradiation.27,57 On the other hand, with further increase in the Ag dosage from 1.0 to 1.5 the PL intensity was found to be increased, indicating faster and higher recombination. This drawback may have been caused by the reduction of the active surface area of the semiconductor exposed to the light irradiation, this phenomena is well consistent with BET analysis, and the surface area reduction was observed for Ag deposited Bi2WO6 compared with pure BW (Table S1†). This may be due to the reduction of surface active sites of Bi2WO6 by the metallic Ag. Also, it can be attributed to the presence of a significant amount of negative Ag sites where positive holes would recombine,27 which is not favorable for the photocatalytic performance.
To determine the surface area and pore size distribution of the plasmonic hybrids N2 adsorption experiments at 77.3 K were performed as shown in Fig. S6a and b.† The DFT surface area and pore volume were calculated to be 6.456 m2 g−1 and 0.025 cc g−1 for bare BW; 6.140 m2 g−1 and 0.029 cc g−1 for BW-Ag-1, respectively (Fig. S6a†). According to the results, the surface area of the BW-Ag-1 composite is reduced compared to bare BW, which might be due to the reason that a part of the surface was possibly blocked by the noble-metal loading on the surface of BW.24 From Fig. S6b,† BW-Ag-1 possesses a pore size distribution ranging from 17.6 to 133.7 nm. Generally, porous structures are useful for the photocatalytic activity because it can offer abundant sites for the adsorption of reactants and also for trapping photogenerated charge carriers.
3.2. Photocatalytic investigation
In order to inspect the photocatalytic performance of the synthesized catalysts, we evaluated our catalysts towards the decomposition of RhB and MG dye under light irradiation as shown in Fig. 5 and 6. Photocatalytic activity was negligible in the absence of any catalyst in the blank reaction, which leads to the conclusion that the dye was mainly decomposed by the catalyst photoabsorption. The intense absorption band wavelength (λmax) of RhB and MG was measured at 554 nm and 617 nm. Prior to irradiation, the suspensions were kept in the dark for 0.5 h to ensure the adsorption–desorption equilibrium. With light irradiation, the BW-Ag-1 catalyst attained the highest photocatalytic activity of about 97.5% and 93.8% for the degradation of RhB and MG pollutants within 120 min as shown in Fig. 5b and 6b, which could be mainly due to the greater photoabsorption capability, superior charge carrier lifetime and surface plasmon resonance effect (SPR). The percentage of degradation for BW was 81.3% and 83.5%, for BW-Ag-0.5 was 82.3% and 91.4% and for BW-Ag-1.5 was 66.7% and 52.5% for RhB and MG dye degradation, respectively. Here, the rhodamine B λmax was shifted from 554 nm to 501 nm after 120 min irradiation owing to the N-demethylation and de-ethylation.58 For MG degradation, the N-demethylation was followed by an attack from species ultimately leading to the removal of all four methyl groups existing in the MG chemical structure to get the final mineralization products59 (Fig. S7†).

The pseudo-first-order model  was used to quantitatively characterize the kinetics of the dye removal, as can be seen from Fig. 5d and 6d, where k is acquired from a linear fit of the data, Ct is the different time of illumination and C0 is the initial concentration. The rate constant (k) of the reaction can be calculated from the slope of the linear fits, as displayed in Fig. 5d and 6d. The reaction rate constant (k) for BW is 1.2 × 10−2 min−1 and 1.1 × 10−2 min−1, for BW-Ag-0.5 is 1.1 × 10−2 min−1 and 1.5 × 10−2 min−1, for BW-Ag-1 is 2.6 × 10−2 min−1 and 1.6 × 10−2 min−1, and for BW-Ag-1.5 is 0.7 × 10−2 min−1 and 0.4 × 10−2 min−1 for RhB and MG degradation, respectively. Obviously, the BW-Ag-1 catalyst possessed higher degradation efficiency ascribed to the fact that it possesses stronger photoabsorption and lower recombination rate due to the effective separation of charge carriers (e−/h+) between the two interfaces.
Furthermore, we have examined the photocatalytic activity at different pH values of MG dye solution, ranging from pH 3 to 11 over the BW-Ag-1 catalyst (Fig. 7a). The initial pH of MG dye solution was 4.8. The pH of the dye solution was adjusted by using diluted HNO3 and NaOH for the experiment while increasing the pH from the initial value to pH 11, which reduced the MG absorption remarkably, which might be due to the adsorption rather than photodegradation.60 The total decomposition took place within a few minutes, which is mainly attributed to the greater availability of the hydroxyl ions (OH−) in this alkaline medium.60 A lower pH accomplished the worst efficiency compared with the initial pH, which was probably due to the poorer availability of OH− ions.59,61 Also, the neutral pH attained higher activity in comparison with an initial pH of MG, which is due to the neutral surface and deprotonation of the dye molecules.

To inspect the stability and recyclability of the BW-Ag-1 catalyst, five repeated cycles were conducted over MG dye degradation and the results are presented in Fig. 7c. After each experiment, the catalyst was collected via centrifugation followed by washing with DI water and ethanol several times and dried at 60 °C overnight. Noticeably, after five cycles of the experiment, the BW-Ag-1 catalyst discloses good stability under successive light irradiation. It was found that the FE-SEM images of the recycled BW-Ag-1 catalyst had almost no considerable difference compared to fresh BW-Ag-1, as can be seen from Fig. S8† though the efficiency was slightly decreased after the five cycles, which might be due to the loss of the catalyst during the collection and washing procedure. However, it can be seen that the BW-Ag-1 catalyst retains high stability during the photoreaction; therefore it qualifies to be a suitable catalyst for practical applications.
In order to determine the main reactive species responsible for the degradation and higher photocatalytic activity of BW-Ag-1, trapping experiments were conducted (Fig. 7d). With the addition of IPA, there was a slight decrease in the degradation efficiency indicating that a certain amount of OH˙ radicals plays a part in the MG photodegradation. For AgNO3, negligible changes were observed, indicating that electrons (e−) were not responsible for the degradation. However, when EDTA-2Na was added to the reaction system, the degradation efficiency decreased dramatically suggesting that holes are the main initiative species in the photocatalytic reaction. Again with the use of p-BQ, the reaction efficiency of BW-Ag-1 was significantly suppressed suggesting that superoxide radicals (˙O2−) are also the main active species in MG photodegradation, which is due to the fact that the reactive species of holes and superoxides were preferentially trapped by the EDTA-2Na and p-BQ scavengers, therefore the degradation efficiency was reduced remarkably, which leads us to the conclusion of h+ and ˙O2− being the primary reactive species in the MG photocatalytic reaction.
3.3. Electrochemical performance
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) characterization was employed to evaluate the electrochemical performance, which is beneficial to study the electron transfer in catalytic reactions.62 According to Fig. 8a, the BW-Ag-1/GC electrode has a larger integral area of the loop than the BW/GC electrode, which reveals higher electrochemical activity due to the quicker charge transferability and higher responding current. The anodic oxidation and cathodic reduction current density at a scan rate of 0.05 mV s−1 for the BW-Ag-1 catalyst was calculated to be 0.03691 A cm−2 and −0.02039 A cm−2, which is significantly larger than that of pure BW which was 0.01123 A cm−2, and −0.00378 A cm−2, respectively. The CV curve was measured on the bare glassy carbon (GC) working electrode as displayed in Fig. 8a, which clearly reveals that the bare GC electrode did not impart any considerable current density in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. From Fig. 8b, the current density and the potential of the redox peaks are increased with increasing scan speed of the BW-Ag-1/GC electrode, which predominantly becomes more at a higher scanning rate. Typically, the scan rate of the reaction being performed controls how fast the applied potential is scanned.62 The variation of anodic and cathodic peak current densities with the square root of scan rate is displayed in Fig. 8c, both the results strongly suggest that the current density has a linear relationship with respect to the square root of the scan rate.

Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out to facilitate the charge-transfer resistance with the frequency ranging from 100 kHz to 1 Hz. The Nyquist plots of BW/GCE and BW-Ag-1/GCE are displayed in Fig. 8d. Here, the X-axis (Z′) is a real part of impedance and the Y axis is the imaginary part of Z′′.63 The small semicircle in the Nyquist plot in the higher-frequency region is related to the charge transfer resistance and the straight line of the lower-frequency region is attributed to the diffusion of the electrolyte ions into the electrode.64Fig. 8d clearly shows that the resistance of BW-Ag-1/GCE is smaller than that of the BW/GC electrode, indicating that the catalytic performance of the BW-Ag-1 electrode was enhanced by the loading of Ag NPs on to the BW, which is owing to the synergetic effects between the two interfaces, it could provide faster electron migration.
3.4. Photocatalytic mechanistic investigation
Taking the above discussion into account, a pathway mechanism of the photocatalytic degradation is proposed in Schemes 2 and 3. As is well known, the valence band (EVB) and conduction band (ECB) values could be determined via the Mullikan electronegativity equation,65 and the EVB and ECB values of BW were calculated to be 3.10 eV and 0.32 eV, respectively. The relevant samples of the EVB and ECB values are summarized in Table S1.† Generally, EVB and ECB can define the respective redox powers of the e− and h+ ability to carry out the reduction and oxidation. Since EVB of BW is more positive than the standard oxidation potential (2.72 eV vs. NHE),66 h+VB effortlessly reacts with OH−/H2O to form the OH˙ radical immediately, however, ˙O2− radicals cannot be formed due to the BW having more positive reduction potential than the standard negative potential of −0.33 eV vs. NHE,66 which leads to faster recombination with lower photocatalytic efficiency. Hence, the BW semiconductor was coupled with the Ag metal, where the efficiency of the reaction was enhanced remarkably owing to two possible factors of the Schottky barrier and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect as elucidated below. When the BW-Ag-1 semiconductor absorbs the photon of energy (hv > Eg), the SVB electrons are excited from the valence band to the conduction band leaving behind holes that easily react with H2O to produce the OH˙ radical species, which could fragment the dye pollutants. Here the CB electrons could be effectively transferred to the Ag nanoparticles due to the movement of electrons from a higher Fermi energy level (EFermi) to a lower Fermi energy level. Generally, prior to the conjunction between BW and Ag, the Ag metal has a lower EFermi compared with n-type semiconductors.67 After the integration of the semiconductor and metal together on the basis of the stability and direction of the electron flow, which will continue until equilibrium between two interfaces is attained, it will form a potential barrier termed a Schottky barrier shown in Scheme 3. Consequently, Ag acts as an electron sink to receive the electrons from SCB, which promotes the interfacial charge transfer between the two interfaces and reduces the recombination rate of e− and h+ in the photoreaction system. Additionally, as we know that the electrons on the Ag metal surface undergo collective oscillation known as the SPR effect, which originates from the interactions between the photons and free carriers from the UV to IR region.30 Due to the SPR, silver could spread out the incident photons around the semiconductor due to the photon scattering and the noble metal can transfer the energy from the metal to semiconductor via an electric field which promotes the rate of the formation of electrons and holes. Probably, noble metals can promote the adsorption and activation of oxygen, which could benefit the photocatalytic process.68 Finally, in plasmon-induced hot electron transfer (PHET) under strong illumination, the reactive e− species may be injected from the Ag metal into the conduction band of BW69 and probably the electrons could react with dissolved oxygen to produce the superoxide radicals fragmenting the dye pollutant adsorbed on the surface.

4. Conclusion
In summary, we have successfully developed BW-Ag plasmonic hybrids via a chemical-free photoreduction route. When the Ag content reached 1 mmol%, BW-Ag-1 attained supreme photocatalytic efficiency compared with pure BW and BW with different contents of the Ag metal. The highest photocatalytic performance of BW-Ag-1 could be ascribed to the effective separation of photoinduced charge carriers between the two interfaces and it could expand the photoabsorption ability to harvest a higher number of photons, also owing to the effect of the SPR and Schottky barrier, which are the key justifications to enhance the performance of the activity of the BW-Ag-1 catalyst. Additionally, the influence of the Ag metal on the BW semiconductor was investigated via crystallographic, morphological, optical, elemental, and luminescence studies. Furthermore, the influence of pH of the dye solution on the photocatalytic performance of BW-Ag-1 was examined. Besides, the primary radical species responsible for the photoreaction were understood via trapping experiments, which point out that h+ and ˙O2− are the dominant species for MG dye degradation. In addition, the recycling experiment was exploited in order to explore the stability and durability of the BW-Ag-1 photocatalyst. Moreover, the cyclic voltammograms and impedance studies disclose that the BW-Ag-1/GCE electrode achieved a superior current density and smaller resistance compared with the BW/GCE electrode. The photocatalytic reaction mechanism was proposed based on the obtained results and a noble metal with a semiconductor achieved better efficiency due to the synergetic effect.
