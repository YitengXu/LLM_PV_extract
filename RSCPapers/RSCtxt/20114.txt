    , Accepted 28th December 2021First published on 7th January 2022AbstractMetal-selenides are one of the next-generation anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), but they suffer from sluggish charge/ion transport, huge volume expansion and aggregation of particles. Herein, ZnSe/C composites with Zn–O–C bonds and 3D hierarchical structure were successfully prepared. Precisely, ZnSe nanoparticles are tightly riveted in the 3D carbon matrix crosslinking by Zn–O–C bonds. The 3D carbon network improves structure stability by restricting volume expansion. More importantly, experimental results along with DFT calculations reveal that Zn–O–C bonds served as electron/charge bridge accelerate charge/ion transfer, indicating fast reaction kinetics. Electrochemically, ZnSe/C composites show an ultra-long lifetime of 1000 cycles at 5 A g−1 with a capacity of 281 mA h g−1. Furthermore, the electrochemical mechanism of conversion and alloy reactions is revealed by monitoring the phase evolutions and internal impedance changes during the charge–discharge process. Remarkably, the superior cycling life arising from 3D carbon matrix and Zn–O–C bonds demonstrates ZnSe/C composites as reversible and promising anode materials for SIBs. Valence bond bridging such as metal–O–C bonds will have broad prospects for enhancing structural stability and electrochemical properties.
1. Introduction
The full utilization of clean natural resources (such as wind, solar, hydropower, and others) is a key to achieving the goal of carbon neutrality.1 But their intermittence and nonuniform distribution inevitably appeal to the urgency of developing effective energy storage devices. Up to now, rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are one of the most successful examples.2–5 In terms of a similar working mechanism with LIBs and the abundant natural source of sodium, SIBs are one of the most promising candidates for next-generation energy storage devices.6,7 Compared to LIBs, a larger radius of Na+ (1.02 Å) than that of Li+ (0.76 Å) determines most anode materials with poor electrochemical dynamics and limited theoretical energy density of SIBs.8 Therefore, it is necessary to explore suitable anode materials to restrain their volume expansion to obtain excellent cycle life.
Recently, transition metal-selenides (TMSes) have attracted much attention to serving as anode materials in SIBs due to their excellent electrochemical performance.6,8–14 However, TMSes still seriously suffer from considerable volume expansion during the reversible (de)intercalation process, especially at the voltage range of 0.01–0.5 V. Meanwhile, sluggish charge/ion transport and the dissolution of poly-selenides, unfortunately, exacerbate the electrochemical performance.15–17 To solve these issues, by shortening the voltage window of 0.5–3.0 V, TMSes such as FeSe,18,19 CoSe2,13,20 and NiSe221 show better cycling performance. But, such approaches undoubtedly impair the energy density of SIBs, which adversely blocks their future development for practical applications.15 On the other hand, nanoparticles possess shorter Na ion and electron pathways to relieve sluggish charge/ion transport.22 The reduction of particle size is usually adopted to enhance the electrode contact area and electrolyte infiltration.23,24 Zhu synthesized NiSe2 nanoparticles with a size of only 150 nm, and the well-developed single crystals exhibited a long cycle life.25 However, the above strategies cannot effectively block the dissolution of poly-selenides that are still threatening the capacity and stability of sodium ion batteries.17,26–28 Accordingly, proposing a proper strategy is greatly important to solve the volume expansion, facilitating electron/ion transfer and anchor poly-selenides.
Not only does the carbon matrix increases the electrical conductivity of transition metal-based materials, but also can serve as an expansion buffer zone and increase the active sites of sodium storage.29 More significantly, metal–oxygen–carbon (M–O–C) bonds can be established to accelerate charge/ions transport, capture and anchor poly-selenides, and enhance the structural stability and performance through rational structure design.30–32 For example, Zn–O–C bonds between ZnO and MWCNT formed through electrospinning technology change the lattice constant, reduce the forbidden band of ZnO from 3.11 eV to 2.94 eV, and improve the conductivity of ZnO.33 Strong Zn–O–C bond structures designed by J. K. Kim prevent the photo-corrosion reaction of ZnO from consuming light-induced holes, thereby improving long-term stability.34 Zn–O–C bonds that are confirmed by Q. Ran suppresses the energy relaxation of electrons at the heterostructure interface.35 Ni–O–C chemical bonds from ultra-small NiO nanoparticles on the nitrogen-doped flower-like carbon significantly improve the overall electrical conductivity and structural stability.36 Wang's group studied N–V,37 Mo–C,38 and Mo–N–C39 bonds to improve electrochemical performance, indicating that the chemical-bridged substrate facilitates charge transfer. Qiushi has also studied the Cu–O–C,40 M–O,41,42 Co–O–Cu bonds43 reconstructing the surface structure of silicon anode for high-performance lithium-ion batteries. Additionally, M–O–C bonds can effectively improve ion transfer and limit the “shuttling effect” of poly-sulfide, thereby maintaining the stability of cycling capacity.29,44–46 Similarly, the formed poly-selenides during electrochemical conversion process could also be anchored by M–O–C bonds by improving electrochemical properties. As far as we know, there are few reports that ZnSe nanoparticles are rivetted in a hierarchical carbon matrix through Zn–O–C bonds to accelerate the electron/ion transfer rate for sodium storage.
In this work, ZnSe/C composites with a 3D large channel hierarchical structure were prepared by high-temperature calcination using the complexing effect of citric acid. XPS and FT-IR strongly confirm that the ZnSe nanoparticles are riveted in the carbon matrix through Zn–O–C bonds. Remarkably, experimental results and calculations reveal that the formed Zn–O–C bonds served as electron/ion bridges and can accelerate electron and ion transport effectively, leading to improved chemical reaction kinetics and excellent rate and cycle performance. The 3D large channel carbon matrix structure has a space limitation effect, thereby, the volume expansion is effectively restricted and alleviated, preventing the aggregation of ZnSe particles during the cycling process. Zn–O–C bonds restrict the dissolution of poly-selenides and extended cycle life of 285 mA h g−1 is obtained even at 5 A g−1 after 1000 cycles.
2. Experiment section
2.1 Synthesis of ZnSe/C
All materials were untreated commercial pharmaceutical powders and of analytical grade. First, 0.6 g Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.3 g citric acid and 0.6 g Se powder were mixed and fully ground for 1 h. The mixture was placed in a burning boat and calcined in a tube furnace in a mixed hydrogen and argon atmosphere. The calcination was carried out at 300 °C for 3 h at a heating rate of 1 °C min−1. Then, the final product ZnSe/C was ground into powder, as shown in Fig. 1.

2.2 Synthesis of pure ZnSe
0.6 g Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.6 g Se powder were mixed and fully ground for 1 h. The sintering conditions and sintering temperature are consistent with the preparation ZnSe/C.
2.3 Materials characterization
The crystallographic structure of the ZnSe/C composite was measured using X-ray diffraction (XRD; Rint-2000, Rigaku) with Cu-Kα radiation from 10° to 80° at a scanning rate of 10° min−1. Raman spectra (Raman, Horiba) were measured on a DXR Raman system with 532 nm diode laser excitation. The surface states of ZnSe/C composite were measured using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; Axis Ultra DLD). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA; Netzsch STA2500 Regulus) was recorded from 25 °C to 800 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 in air. The morphology and elemental distribution in ZnSe/C composite were studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Tescan Mira3 LMH) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX; Oxford X Max20), respectively. The microstructure was studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEM-2100F) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED; JEM-2100F). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was performed to study functional groups. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas and pore size distributions in the ZnSe/C composite were determined by nitrogen adsorption and desorption (ASAP 2460).
2.4 Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical performance of the ZnSe/C composite was tested by assembling the CR2025 button cell in a glove box filled with argon. To manufacture SIB anodes, 70 wt% active material, 15 wt% Super P, and 15 wt% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) were evenly mixed together with deionized water as a solvent. The homogeneous slurry was then coated on a copper foil, which was vacuum dried for 12 hours at 60 °C before being cut into a disc (current collector) with a diameter of 10 mm. The bulk load of the active substance was approximately 1.3 mg cm−2. The diaphragm was a fiberglass membrane, and the reference electrode was a metal sodium foil. The electrolyte was 1 M sodium trifluoromethanesulfonate (NaCF3SO3) dissolved in diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DEGDME).
All sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) had a voltage test window of 0.1–3.0 V and were placed in a 27 °C thermostat. Ex situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, frequency from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) were measured using the electrochemical workstation CHI660E. Constant current charging and discharging, and the rate data were measured using the LAND electric test system (5 V 10 mA).
2.5 Theoretical computation
DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) with the frozen-core all-electron projector-augment-wave (PAW) method.47 The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)48 of generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was adopted to describe the exchange and correlation potential. The cutoff energy for the plane-wave basis was set at 450 eV. The 3 × 3 ZnSe(111) slab has 3-layer atoms, and a vacuum region of 15 Å above the slab was used to ensure the decoupling between neighboring systems. A mono-layer 5 × 5 carbon layer was placed on ZnSe(111) slab surface to build the c/ZnSe heterojunction. For the geometry optimization, the atoms in the bottom layer of the ZnSe(111) slab were fixed to their bulk positions. The geometry optimizations were performed until the forces on each ion were reduced below 0.01 eV Å−1. The 3 × 3 × 1 k-point sampling of the Brillouin zone was used. The climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB)49 method was adopted to calculate diffusion barriers of Na+ on pure ZnSe(111) slab and graphene/ZnSe heterojunction.
3. Results and discussion
The formation mechanism of ZnSe/C is shown in Fig. 1, where the carbon network can rivet ZnSe nanoparticles by the chelation effect of citric acid. The melt citric acid monohydrate chelates with Zn2+ in the form of –COO–Zn. Then, H2Se gas, that generated from the reaction of H2 with Se powders in a 5% H2 atmosphere, reacts with –COO–Zn to form ZnSe and H2O. In addition, a part of O atoms is captured by C atoms in the form of CO2. At high temperatures, CO2 and H2O gas expand the carbon matrix to form large channel network with a 3D structure. The ZnSe nanoparticles and carbon matrix are connected by Zn–O–C bonds, which provides a fast pathway for electrons and ions transport.30,50

Fig. 2a shows the XRD pattern of the ZnSe/C composite. The crystal structure conforms to cubic ZnSe in the  space group (F3m#216m, a = b = c = 0.5773 nm), and the diffraction peaks are well compatible with the JCPDs No. 37-1463 standard. The characteristic peaks at 27.2°, 45.2°, 53.6°, 65.8°, and 72.6° correspond to the (110), (220), (311), (400), and (311) planes,51 respectively. There are no obvious characteristic peaks of carbon in Fig. 2a and S2a,† probably because the strong peak of ZnSe masks the carbon peaks. Compared with the excellent crystallinity of pure ZnSe, the lower crystallinity of ZnSe/C is due to the crosslinking between ZnSe nanoparticles and carbon matrix.52,53

As illustrated in Fig. 2b, the Raman spectrum of ZnSe/C shows D and G peaks of 1415 and 1558 cm−1, corresponding to the sp3 and sp2 hybrid carbon, respectively. An ID/IG ratio of 0.96 is obtained by fitting the curve with the Gauss law. This value indicates that the carbon matrix has a high degree of graphitization, which is propitious to the space limitation effect and the electron/ion transfer rate.54 The peak at 250 cm−1 is in good agreement with the LO (Longitudinal Optical) modes of ZnSe.55Fig. 2c shows FT-IR spectra of the ZnSe/C composites, pure ZnSe, carbon and zinc acetylacetonate. The absorption peak of zinc acetylacetonate at 500 cm−1 corresponds to Zn–O–C bonds.31,35,50,56 This peak is also found in ZnSe/C, indicating the existence of Zn–O–C bonds in ZnSe/C composites. The specific surface area of ZnSe/C composites is 6.81 m2 g−1 as seen from Fig. S1a.† Moreover, the pore size distribution demonstrates that ZnSe/C has both mesopores and macropores, and most of the pores are mesopores (Fig. S1d†). As shown in Fig. S1b,† the TG/DTA curve of ZnSe/C indicates that ZnSe is oxidized to ZnO at 396 °C, and the other SeO2 product is sublimated simultaneously. The carbon matrix is oxidized into CO2 at 500 °C,57 speculating the carbon content of about 25% (WC (%) = 1 − WZnOxMZnSe/MZnO). Fig. S2b† exhibits the XRD pattern of the corresponding combustion products, ZnSe/C becomes ZnO completely after calcination in air. Fig. S1c† shows that the ZnSe nano-particles are cross-linked with the carbon matrix through the Zn–O–C bonds.
To further confirm the existence of Zn–O–C bonds, the elemental valence and surface chemical composition of ZnSe/C composites are analyzed by XPS. Fig. 2d–h shows the characteristic peaks of Zn 2p, C 1s, Se 3d, and O 1s. The characteristic peak located at 286.35 eV in high-resolution spectra of C 1s proves the existence of Zn–O–C bonds in ZnSe/C composites (Fig. 2e).44,50,58 The characteristic peaks of 284.78, 287.77, and 289.11 eV correspond to the bonds of C–C, C–O, and CO, respectively.59 Meanwhile, in the high-resolution spectrum of O 1s (Fig. 2f), Zn–O–C bonds are also found at 533.03 eV.60 The characteristic peaks at 534.01 and 531.67 eV correspond to C–O and CO bonds, respectively.21,50 The characteristic peaks of O 1s result from the oxygen element in the raw material. The characteristic peaks of Zn 2p are composed of two main peaks of Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 (Fig. 2g) located at 1020.98 and 1048.83 eV, corresponding to Zn–Se and Se–Zn–Se bonds, respectively.51,61,62Fig. 2h shows the high-resolution spectrum of Se 3d. Gaussian fitting can split the Se 3d into three peaks of 54.07, 55.18, and 56.20 eV, corresponding to Se 3d5/2, Se 3d3/2, and Se2−, respectively. Among them, Zn–Se bonds are indexed to the peak at 56.2 eV.58,63,64 These above analyses preliminarily confirm the successful synthesis of ZnSe/C composites. Zn–O–C bonds served as a bridge that would provide a new channel for fast electron/ion transport, and improve the dynamics of electrochemical reactions.56
As shown in Fig. 3a–c, ZnSe/C composites exhibit 3D hierarchical and macroporous structure, which is beneficial to the permeation of electrolytes and the formation of a stable SEI film.29,65–67 Meanwhile, the nanoparticles are embedded uniformly and dispersed in the carbon matrix, as seen from the TEM image in Fig. 3h. Fig. 3d–g show that Zn, Se, O and C elements are uniformly distributed in the composite, and the ratio of Zn and Se elements in the composites is approximately 1:1 (Fig. S3†). Fig. 3i shows that the lattice spacings are 0.328 and 0.200 nm, corresponding to [111] and [220] planes, respectively (ZnSe, PDF# 34-1463).63 The SAED image (Fig. 3j) shows the lattice of [111], [220], and [311].63,68 Impressively, these results further demonstrate that ZnSe nanoparticles are successfully embedded in the carbon matrix. Among them, the carbon network is conducive to space limitations.13,69,70 Small primary particle size can increase the distribution of Zn–O–C bonds on the interface of ZnSe and carbon matrix and induce more Na+ to participate in the redox reactions.50,71

Galvanostatic discharge/charge profiles were measured to investigate the electrochemical performance of ZnSe/C composites as shown in Fig. 4. At a current density of 0.5 A g−1, the initial discharge/charge capacity of ZnSe/C is 525/451 mA h g−1 with a high coulombic efficiency of 86.31% (Fig. 4b). Note that the capacity of only 38 mA h g−1 is extremely low for pure carbon materials that decomposed from citric acid (Fig. S2c†). It shows that the capacity of ZnSe/C composites is mainly originating from the ZnSe phase. Correspondingly, the carbon matrix plays the role of improving the electrical conductivity and alleviating the volume expansion.50 The capacity of ZnSe/C is slightly attenuated in the first 100 cycles due to the formation of stable SEI films.72–74 Overwhelmingly, the capacity can remain at 434 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles with a coulombic efficiency of about 100% from as seen in Fig. 4a. In contrast, the serious capacity decay to 187 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles shows the inferior stability of pure ZnSe (Fig. 4a). We also explored the electrochemical properties of the mixture (pure ZnSe and pure carbon milled for one hour). The poor electrochemical performance indicates that the Zn–O–C bonds play an important role in stability. From Fig. 4c, ZnSe/C composites exhibit excellent rate performances of 480.5, 426.6, 381, 357, 316.3, 298.5, and 281.1 mA h g−1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 2.5 and 5.0 A g−1, respectively. The capacity can return to 441 mA h g−1 when the current density reverts to 0.1 A g−1. The platform with good symmetry shows a reversible phase transition process of ZnSe/C composites during charge and discharge at various current densities from Fig. 4d. The discharge-specific capacity of the composite can still maintain at 285 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at 5.0 A g−1 (Fig. 4e). This is a superior electrochemical performance than that of many other zinc-based selenides used in SIBs and other transition metal selenide materials (Fig. 4g and Table S1†). As shown in Fig. 4f, there are two complete sodiation/desodiation processes in 49800 seconds at 0.5 A g−1 and stable platforms from the 200th to 210th loops. In brief, the outstanding cycling and rate performance of ZnSe/C are synergistically attributed to the protection of the carbon matrix and the efficient electron/ion bridge of Zn–O–C bonds.67,70,75,76 The spatial confinement effect of the carbon matrix affords enough space to tolerate the volume expansion, and Zn–O–C bonds featured as electron/ion bridging provide a new channel for fast charge/ion transfer and anchor the poly-selenides without dissolution.

To explore the sodium storage mechanism of ZnSe/C anode, CV measurements at various scanning rates were performed as illustrated in Fig. 5. In Fig. 5a, the reduction peaks from high to low voltage are defined as Peak1, Peak2, and Peak3, and the main oxidation peaks are defined as Peak4, Peak5, and Peak6. In the cathodic scan, the peak at 1.81 V could be assigned to Na+ intercalation, the peaks at 1.56 V and 0.5 V could be ascribed to the conversion of ZnSe to Zn, which is reduced to NaZn13.16,55 For the anodic scan, the peak located at 0.9 V corresponds to the sodium dealloying reaction, and 1.5 V could be attributed to the reversible conversion from Zn to ZnSe.17,33 The stable reactions of the electrode are listed in Table 1.

The response current of CV curves increases gradually along with the upward scanning rate, and the resembling shapes and negligible shift of the redox peaks indicate that the reversible phase transition process of composites even at a high current rate. Then, the sodium ion diffusion coefficient is calculated using the formula (1): Ip = 2.69 × 105n3/2AD1/2v1/2CNa+(1)
The reduction and oxidation values of Ip/v1/2 are −2.89 and 2.58, respectively (Fig. 5b and d), according to the fitted linear connection between the reduction/oxidation peak current (Ip) and the square root of the scanning rate (v).
In formula (1), n is the number of electrons transported in the chemical reaction, A is the cut area of the current collector in cm2, D is the sodium ion diffusion coefficient in cm2 s−1, and CNa+ is the intrinsic Na+ concentration in mol L−1. The diffusion coefficients of cathode and anode sodium ions are 1.13 × 10−11 cm2 s−1 and 8.99 × 10−12 cm2 s−1, respectively, the average diffusion coefficient of ZnSe/C is 1.104 × 10−11 cm2 s−1, much higher than the average ion diffusion coefficient of bulk ZnSe 5.35 × 10−15 cm2 s−1. In addition, the electrochemical mechanism is controlled by diffusion and pseudo-capacitance behavior. Fig. 5c shows a good linear relationship between logI and logv following formula (2):50,72,77 logI = blogv + loga(2)in which a and b are adjustable values. When b is close to 1, the electrochemical behavior of ZnSe/C is controlled by pseudo-capacitance behavior; when b is close to 0.5, it is controlled by a diffusion step. As shown in Fig. 5c, the corresponding b values of Peak1, Peak2, Peak3, Peak4, Peak5, and Peak6 are 0.84, 0.81, 0.68, 0.55, 1.16, and 0.74, respectively. Thereby, the diffusion-controlled and surface-controlled pseudocapacitive behavior occur simultaneously in the ZnSe/C based SIBs.78–81 The b values of pure ZnSe are 0.457 (reduction peak) and 0.467 (oxidation peak), indicating that the kinetic behavior of pure ZnSe is controlled by diffusion.
In addition, with increasing scanning speed, the relationship between logI and logv still shows a good linear relationship. According to the formula (3):69,82,83 I(v) = k1v + k2v1/2(3)in which k1v and k2v1/2 stand for the surface-controlled pseudo-capacitive behavior and diffusion-controlled process, respectively.61,63 The capacity contribution rate of pseudo-capacitance behavior is evaluated. As shown in Fig. 5e and f, the capacitance contribution rate of the material is approximately 56.7% at 0.3 mV s−1. The capacitance contribution of the material increases gradually with increasing scanning speed, and the pseudo-capacitance contribution rate of ZnSe/C is higher than that of pure ZnSe at any scan rate, indicating that ZnSe/C has faster reaction kinetics. At 2.0 mV s−1, the capacitance-controlled contribution of the material is approximately 86.2%, indicating that capacitive-controlled behavior contributes to crucial capacity at high current density due to the Zn–O–C bonds of the ZnSe/C.
Furthermore, ex situ XRD, SAED, and HRTEM have been used to monitor the phase evolution and structural changes in the first cycle of the ZnSe/C anode. As expected, the main diffraction peaks of cubic ZnSe are clearly detected in the initial state (Fig. 6a). The diffraction peaks of Zn and Na2Se appear when the discharge reached 1.0 V. Upon being discharged to 0.5 V, a weak diffraction peak of NaZn13 is detected due to the alloying reaction of Na+ with Zn,60,84 and the diffraction peaks of ZnSe progressively decrease and eventually vanish (Fig. 6a). After full discharge to 0.1 V, the material is completely converted to NaZn13 and Na2Se, confirming that conversion and alloying reactions occur for the ZnSe/C anode in SIBs.84,85 When charged to 1.3 V, the strong characteristic diffraction peaks of cubic ZnSe progressively recover throughout the subsequent charge process, and the diffraction peaks of Zn, Na2Se, and NaZn13 disappear completely. When charged to 1.0 V, NaZn13 disappears gradually, and the diffraction peak of Zn emerges. Na+ is totally released after fully charged to 3.0 V, and significant characteristic peaks of ZnSe are detected. Moreover, SADE and HRTEM images also confirm the change in crystalline structure and morphology of ZnSe/C (Fig. 6c and S8†). The shape of ZnSe nanospheres does not change after 500 cycles under the protection of the carbon matrix. Notably, when discharged to 0.1 V after 500 cycles, resultant nanoparticles are still placed in the carbon matrix without the shuttle and dissolution of poly-selenides. Meanwhile, the polycrystalline diffraction rings of (111) and (200) planes of Na2Se (JCPDs: 23-0527) decidedly disclose the effective anchor of poly-selenides. (420) and (531) planes of NaZn13 (JCPDs: 03-1008), and (101) and (102) planes of Zn (JCPDs: 04-0831) are clearly visible, suggesting the conversion by an alloying mechanism (Fig. 6d and e). In Fig. 6d, the lattice fringes of these discharge intermediates can also be observed. ZnSe/C composites preserve preeminently structural and morphological stability. Ex situ EIS has been employed to monitor the internal impedance changes, which directly reflect the phase evolution during the charge–discharge process, as shown in Fig. 7. Meanwhile, the selected monitoring points are located at the particular voltage of phase transition according to the XRD analysis. Fig. 7b and c show the Nyquist curve of pristine ZnSe/C anode and the corresponding equivalent circuit diagram. The Rs is a semicircle intercept in the high-frequency region, which comes from the inherent resistance of the battery, such as electrolyte, electrode material, and so on. In the high-frequency region, Rct and Rf are semicircles that represent the charge transfer resistance.9,58,61,81,86–88 Through fitting, the Rct (charge transfer resistance) value of only 40 Ω determines the prominent electrical conductivity for ZnSe/C. On the contrary, the Rct value of pure ZnSe is much greater than that of ZnSe/C, which further proves that the Zn–O–C bonds accelerate the electron transfer and decrease the internal resistance.

Fig. 7d and e discloses the variation trend of resistance during the discharge and charge process according to the Nyquist curves at the first cycle. During the discharge process, from 3.0 V to 1.0 V, the Rct is first observed to decrease significantly. This is due to the presence of Na2Se and Zn with higher conductivity during the conversion reaction, while the Rct value increases with continuous discharge to 0.1 V, then it increases to the maximum value (70 Ω), mainly due to the formation of a poorly conductive Zn–Na alloy and the volume expansion during the alloying process.55 At the subsequent charge profile, the charge transfer impedance decays sharply due to the uncompleted dealloying reaction from 0.1 to 0.9 V. Remarkably, the resistance at 3.0 V is equal to the original state, indicating that the composites display good charge/discharge reversibility. As expected, the phase transition recorded by the ex situ EIS is remarkably similar to the ex situ XRD reaction described above. Consequently, for the first time, we have verified the conversion and alloying reaction mechanism of ZnSe/C through ex situ XRD and ex situ EIS experiments, which is of great significance for guiding the design of high energy density electrode materials.
The structural stability of the ZnSe/C composite anode is reflected by the variations in electrode thickness. Fig. S10† displays the variations in the thickness of the ZnSe/C electrodes initially and after 100 and 500 cycles. As depicted in Fig. S10a–c,† the thickness of the ZnSe/C electrode increases from 31 μm to 31.2 μm (about 3.8%). The 3D large channel carbon matrix structure has a space limitation effect, thereby the volume expansion is effectively restricted and alleviated.
In order to understand the influence of the Zn–O–C bonds in ZnSe/C on the kinetics of sodium storage reaction at the phase interface, density functional theory (DFT) was used to analyze the diffusion barrier, electronic structure, charge density difference of pure ZnSe and composite ZnSe/C. Based on the experimental characterization, the proposed DFT calculation models are shown in Fig. S11.† On the one hand, the establishment of the interface Zn–O–C bonds improves the conductivity of the composite material and reduces the diffusion energy barrier of sodium ions. The diffusion paths of sodium ions formed by pure ZnSe and ZnSe/C are shown in Fig. 8a and b depicts their corresponding diffusion barriers under different transitions. When Na+ is adsorbed on the surface of pure ZnSe, it will be adsorbed on the Hollow sites formed by the three Se on the surface, which will cause dislocation and upliftment of Se on the surface, and the migration energy barrier is about 0.43 eV. When Na+ is adsorbed on the ZnSe/C composite interface, the Zn–O–C bonds on the surface are beneficial to fix the ZnSe structure, and there is no obvious bulge of Se atoms on the surface, the Na+ migration energy barrier is about 0.29 eV. The migration energy barrier of ZnSe/C is about half that of pure ZnSe. The density of states (DOSs) shows that ZnSe is a direct band gap semiconductor with a band gap of 2.14 eV (Fig. 8d), while the band gap of ZnSe/C near the Fermi level is 0, indicating that the conductivity of the material has been significantly improved.89 This finding is consistent with the above EIS results. On the other hand, the analysis of the differential charge density in the ZnSe/C phase boundary indicates that the Zn–O–C bonds promote charge transfer. As shown in Fig. 8c, most of the charge accumulation (yellow area) and charge consumption (blue area) overlap around the Zn, O, and C atoms, which induce the rearrangement of charges, greatly promoting the transfer of charge and improving the reaction dynamics.

In view of the excellent electrochemical performance of ZnSe/C in half-cells, we combined it with commercial Na3V2(PO4)3 to form a full-cell. Na3V2(PO4)3 was purchased from Shenzhen Kejing. Before assembling the full battery, ZnSe/C was pre-sodiumized three times in the half-cell, and the cycle performance of the full battery was explored in the voltage range of 3.0–0.1 V. The mass ratio of the cathode and anode is 4:1. It is worth mentioning that the assembled full-cell can easily light up commercial LED lights. The second round of charging and discharging capacity of the full battery is 211/162 mA h g−1. After 100 cycles, the charging and discharging capacity is 175/122 mA h g−1. It is noted that it is still necessary to explore a cathode material that is more compatible with ZnSe/C in order to improve the coulombic efficiency and meet the needs of commercialization.
In summary, the experimental results and DFT calculations confirm that ZnSe/C has faster reaction kinetics, and the excellent electrochemical performance benefits from the following two aspects: (1) Zn–O–C bonds served as electron/charge bridge to accelerate charge/ion transfer, improve the overall conductivity of the material, promote charge rearrangement, speed up the charge and ion transfer rate, and reduce the energy barrier of sodium ion diffusion. (2) The 3D carbon network has a space limitation effect, which improves the structural stability and prevents the aggregation of ZnSe particles.
4. Conclusion
Summary, ZnSe/C with 3D hierarchical structure was successfully prepared by a combination of chelation effect and high-temperature calcination and employed as excellent anode materials in SIBs. Structurally, ZnSe nanoparticles are anchored on the unique 3D carbon matrix which alleviates the large volume expansion during the charging/discharging process. More important, experimental results along with DFT calculations reveal that Zn–O–C bonds serve as electron/ion bridge integrate, crosslink ZnSe nanoparticles and carbon matrix, and further accelerate charge/ion transport and electrochemical dynamics. Electrochemically, when the current densities are 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 2.5, and 5.0 A g−1, ZnSe/C anode achieves a reversible capacity of 480.5, 426.6, 381, 357, 316.3, 298.5, and 281.1 mA h g−1, respectively. Impressively, it also exhibits a highly stable cycle performance with 434 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 0.5 A g−1 and 285 mA h g−1 over 1000 cycles at 5.0 A g−1. EIS and XRD results underline that ZnSe/C presents a stable conversion and alloy reaction mechanism during the charge/discharge process. Accordingly, the predominant electrochemical performance of the ZnSe/C composite is not only ascribed to the unique 3D structure, but also to the established Zn–O–C bonds, accompanied by enhanced electrical conductivity and excellent stress relaxation. Furthermore, the existence of Zn–O–C bonds could efficiently capture the poly-selenides and ensure a highly coulombic efficiency upon the electrochemical profiles. Valence bond bridging will have broad prospects for enhancing structural stability and electrochemical properties.
