    , Accepted 27th November 2017First published on 28th November 2017AbstractNatural energy haversting devices serve as an alternative candidate for power supply in many micro-/nano-systems. However, traditional nanogenerators based on piezoelectricity or triboelectric power generation face challenges in terms of biocompatibility and stability in various biological systems. The bacteriorhodopsin (bR) protein in Halobacterium halobium is an ideal biocompatible material for photoelectric conversion. Conventional bR systems based on ion transport or enhanced light absorption layers have a limited light power conversion speed. On the other hand, bR-based biohybrid devices have a great potential for sensitive light power conversion as compared to conventional nanogenerators. Herein, we present a biohybrid nanogenerator made of bR and horizontally aligned-long carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with electron–ion interaction for the first time for sensitive light power conversion. The bR layer serves as the proton pump, whereas CNTs are utilized to enhance the photocurrent; thus, the photocurrent frequency response improves significantly because of the effect of the electron–ion interaction. The photocurrent shows a linear relationship with the intensity of light and can still obtain a stable signal at a light intensity of 0.03 mW cm−2. With regard to the influence of the light on–off period, the photocurrent initially increases and then decreases with an increase in flickering frequency up to 360 Hz; this can be ascribed to the combinational influence of light switch speed and photocycle decay time. The photocurrent shows highest value (99 nA cm−2) at a frequency of about 50 Hz at a light intensity of 0.43 mW cm−2, which matches well with the frequency standard of the electrical power supply system. Moreover, we found that a higher density of CNTs contributed to improve performance of the nanogenerators. Furthermore, a H+ ion releasing model was proposed to interpret the operating mechanism of the biohybrid nanogenerator. The biohybrid nanogenerator shows great potential for applications as a power source for bio-nanosystems.
Introduction
Natural energy harvesting devices, which can serve as a power source for many micro-/nano-systems, have attracted extensive research interest.1–3 Many kinds of nanogenerators based on various energy harvesting mechanisms have been put forward to meet the demands in different application areas.4–7 For example, piezoelectric power generation based on traditional nanogenerators has limited applications in various biological systems because of insufficient biocompatibility and stability of these nanogenerators.3,8 A novel design of green and efficient bio-nanogenerators based on solar energy conversion of photosynthetic systems is highly desired for biocompatible applications.9,10 In nature, there are mainly two kinds of biohybrid photosynthetic systems:11 one is the well-known chloroplast system in green plants,12,13 and the other is the bacteriorhodopsin (bR) system in Halobacterium halobium.14,15 Compared with the conventional energy conversion based on electron transfer in green plants,16,17 the directional proton transport in bR molecules exhibits a more controllable energy conversion process,18–20 according to which many photoelectric devices, such as light batteries,21 photo switching components,22 and light-powered bio-capacitors,23 have been developed. The proton pump function of bR protein shows potential applications as a photosynthetic bio-nanogenerator by utilizing directional proton transport across the purple membrane.24–26 Moreover, its biological stability enables its application in various biological environments.27,28
Conventional bR devices based on ion transport or an enhanced light absorption layer show limited speed of light power conversion in previous studies.9,29 New operation mechanisms of electron–ion interaction can provide a potential solution to improve the frequency response of the bR-devices.30–33 To achieve a desired coupling effect between electron and proton transport, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) combined with high electron mobility due to ballistic transport are ideal candidates.34,35 Moreover, carbon, as the basic element on earth, is the component of all kinds of living organisms; this makes CNTs a promising biocompatible material for the fabrication of bio-devices.36–38 For example, Huang et al.39 reported a hybrid bio-nanoelectronic CNT transistor with a local ATP-powered protein gate, which provided a versatile bionanoelectronic platform for incorporating other membrane proteins, showing the potential of CNTs for the fabrication of high-performance bionanodevices. However, conventional non-aligned CNTs have a lot of junctions between CNTs; these junctions result in low mobility and high contact resistance.40,41 To achieve high mobility CNTs and fast electron–ion interaction, aligned-long CNTs are used for incorporation into bR-based devices, which further improve the photocurrent and frequency response of the bio-nanogenerator.
In this study, we have proposed a new operating mechanism based on electron–ion interaction, which can improve the speed of light power conversion. Fig. 1 schematically shows the operation mechanisms of traditional nanogenerators, conventional bR devices, and novel bio-nanogenerators. As shown in Fig. 1a, traditional nanogenerators generate polarized electric charges on the surface of the materials by compressing the piezoelectric materials at the nanoscale, realizing the conversion of mechanical energy into electricity. However, many traditional piezoelectric nanomaterials show poor biocompatibility because of heavy metal component elements such as Pb. Fig. 1b shows the operating mechanisms of conventional bR devices based on ion transport, in which H+ ions are transported through nanochannels because of a proton gradient between two half photoelectrochemical cells, and the limited H+ transport speed greatly suppresses the light power conversion speed. Fig. 1c shows the electron–ion interaction transport in the novel biohybrid nanogenerator proposed by us, and the bR proteins stimulated by light can release protons to the extracellular (EC) side of the purple membrane. H+ adsorbed on the surface of the CNTs can attract electrons from the opposite side of the CNTs; this results in the generation of forward current. When the light turns off, the bR proteins will immediately absorb protons to the cytoplasmic (CP) side, which turns out desorption of H+ ions from the CNTs surface. The extra electron will return to the opposite side of the CNTs by charge redistribution; this will lead to the generation of reverse current. This operating mechanism improves the light power conversion speed significantly because of the combination of the high mobility of ballistic transport of electrons in the CNTs and the coupling effect of proton and electron transport. On the basis of this mechanism, aligned CNT arrays were utilized for the fabrication of a bR-based biohybrid nanogenerator for the first time, and an obviously enhanced performance of the nanogenerator was demonstrated. A custom-designed photoelectric measuring system was used to provide weak light (nearly 200 times weaker than standard sunlight irradiance (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2)). The nanogenerator showed a noticeably sensitive response and low basic current level under this condition. The influence of the light intensity and frequency was also studied to understand the regulation of the generated photocurrent. Furthermore, the influence of the density of the CNTs was investigated, indicating that the performance of the bR-based nanogenerator could be largely improved using denser CNTs. Finally, a H+ ion releasing model was proposed to interpret the operating mechanism of the biohybrid nanogenerator, offering a potential possibility to further improve the performance of the bio-nanogenerator and providing support for future power supply in cell-scale bio-systems.

Results and discussion
Device fabrication and structural characterization

Fig. 2a schematically shows the structure of our biohybrid nanogenerator. An array of millimeter-scale CNTs was first grown on a highly doped Si substrate with an 800 nm oxide layer by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method (see Experimental section, Fig. S1 and Table S1† for detailed information of the as-grown CNTs). The Cr/Au (2 nm/50 nm) electrode (1 cm in length) was made by conventional photolithography and evaporation on one side of the CNTs. After the second step of photolithography, a small square area (3 mm × 3 mm) on the substrate deposited with long and aligned CNTs was defined using photolithography, which was used as an effective area for photocurrent density calculations afterwards. A reconstituted bR layer is then constructed on the surface of the square area through evaporation-induced assembly,42 and the hydrophobicity of the aligned-long CNTs will result in the self-assembled orientation of the bR layer (CNTs/EC-CP) during this process (see Fig. S2† for more details).43 Herein, a 5 μL Na2SO4 solution (0.1 mol L−1) was dropped on the bR layer to provide a workable biocompatible environment for the protein.

A custom-designed photoelectric measuring system was built to provide the tunable weak light with a small light spot (Fig. S3†). Before introduction into the shielding box, the intensity of the light was detected by a light power meter at the gate of the shielding box, and the frequency of light was adjusted by the photochopper such that the biohybrid nanogenerator could be motivated by flicking light with light-on/off stimulation.

Fig. 2b and c show an optical image and a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the bR-based biohybrid nanogenerator, respectively. The structure of the nanogenerator, as shown in the optical image, includes three parts: the metal strip (the top golden area), the photoresist (the middle part), and the bR layer (the bottom of the image). As shown in Fig. 2b, the bR layer shows a uniform distribution in the work area. It is worth noting that a part of the photoresist over the metal strip was removed to contact the probe for measurement of photocurrents, whereas the other part was covered with photoresist, preventing overflow of the bR/Na2SO4 solution from the electrode. The SEM image presents the microstructure of the biohybrid nanogenerator, and the dark area at the bottom refers to the bR layer. The CNTs are shown clearly in the SEM image, indicating that they work well in connecting the electrode and bR layer. In addition to this, the uniformity of the bR layer in the square area was demonstrated in the AFM image, as shown in Fig. S4,† with a roughness of around 12.6 nm.
Photocurrent testing of the biohybrid nanogenerator
When the biohybrid nanogenerator was tested, two probes were set to common and 0 V and connected to the Cr/Au electrode and Na2SO4 solution, respectively. Thus, the voltage between the Au electrode and the Na2SO4 solution was kept at a constant value of 0 V, and the current was measured with time. A flicking light with a switch frequency of 2 Hz was shone on the device through a photoelectric measuring system. A typical response curve of the photocurrent is shown in Fig. 3a, which presents a prompt spike-like shape. The low dark current (as shown in Fig. S5†) of 0.005 nA cm−2 refers to the low electric leakage in the device, which is of great importance for the excellent performance of the nanogenerator. The photocurrent results without the bR layer or the Na2SO4 solution shown in Fig. S6 and S7† demonstrate that bR is the key material for the light responses, and Na2SO4 solution is necessary to provide a biocompatible environment for the protein. With increasing time, the intensity of the photocurrent reached a peak value of around 11 nA cm−2, and the signal frequency matched the light frequency well. To make a comparison, the photocurrent of the bR biohybrid device based on the ITO substrate was also tested under the same conditions (shown in Fig. S8†). The resistance of the CNT array is hundreds of kilohm and the sheet resistance of ITO is 10 Ω □−1. It is clear that the photocurrent will decrease over 10 times by replacing the CNTs to ITO, and the stability of the signal is much worse. Fig. 3b shows the enlarged spike photoelectric signal, revealing that a forward current appears when light turns on and a reverse current appears as the light turns off. The half peak width of the photocurrent is about 0.05 s, which is consistent with the reported studies.9,22 Besides the photocurrent results, the voltage output result is also provided in Fig. S9† to better demonstrate the performance of the nanogenerator. Due to influence of different chemical potentials between the Na2SO4 and Cr/Au electrode, the output voltage decreased gradually with time and reached a stable peak value around 60 mV. The bR proteins stimulated by light can release protons to the EC side and subsequently absorb protons from the CP side. Thus, in the proton pump process of bR molecules, the CP side is related to the reprotonation process, and the EC side is related to the protonation process. The proton pump and reprotonation process is the main mechanism for the polarity of the photoelectric signal, which have been discussed hereinafter. As shown in Fig. 3b, there are small noises at 1 nA level in the signal when the forward current returns to the base level, which may be caused by the unstable excess adsorption of H+ ions on the CNT surface. The noise is one order lower than the effective signal, which can be ignored because of the relative larger SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio). Finally, Fig. S10† shows the photocurrent response of the initial device and that after one month, which confirms the high stability of the nanogenerator.

The frequency of the simulated light was 2 Hz, and the light power density was 0.43 mW cm−2. (b) Enlarged photoelectric signal between 5.3 s and 6.5 s from (a). (c) Influence of the light power density on photocurrents. The light power density changed from 0.03 mW cm−2 to 0.43 mW cm−2. 
The influence of the light intensity on the photocurrent was also investigated. As shown in Fig. 3c, with an increase in light power density, the photocurrent intensity will increase, showing a nearly linear relationship. When the light power density changed from 0.03 mW cm−2 to 0.43 mW cm−2, the photocurrent intensity increased to about 11 nA cm−2. Thus, the regulation of photocurrent by light density provides a convenient approach to control the power of the nanogenerators.
Influence of the CNT density and the light frequency
To investigate the effect of CNTs on enhancing the photocurrents, the signals without the Cr/Au electrode contact were also obtained (Fig. S11†). It is understandable that charge redistribution can also generate photocurrent when only one probe is connected. The photocurrent was enhanced about 4 times when the probe contacted with CNTs; this indicated that the CNTs played an important role in enhancing the charge transport in the device.
The dependence of performance on the density of the CNTs was further investigated. Fig. 4 shows the photocurrents of two discriminating devices with a high (5 CNTs mm−1) (Sample A) or low density (1 CNTs mm−1) of CNTs (Sample B). The CNT density is defined as the average numbers of CNTs in each mm over the contact area. The morphology of these two devices is shown in the Fig. S12:† the white lines connecting to the electrode stand for the CNTs, which clearly indicate that the CNTs in the sample A show a higher density and longer length. Generally, density and length of CNTs are the two main factors that influence the contact of CNTs and bR molecules, which further affect the photocurrent. Based on the ion-electron interaction mechanisms, the value of photocurrent (Ip) is proportional to the total length of CNTs (Σli), in which li is the length of each CNTs exposed in the square area. According to Fig. 4, it is obvious that the photocurrent increases dramatically (nearly 100 times) with the increasing contact length between bR and the CNTs. Moreover, due to the decrease in the photocurrent, the signal is much more vibrational. It can be understood that a higher density of CNTs can improve the performance of the nanogeneretor by enhancing the efficiency of charge transport. Moreover, another device (Sample C) was fabricated to verify the repeatability of the devices. Longer timeframe experiments have also been investigated, and more details are shown in Fig. S13 and S14.†

Furthermore, as a photoelectric nanogenerator, the amplitudes of photocurrent can be effectively controlled by the frequencies of the stimulating light. As shown in Fig. 5, the amplitude of photocurrent initially increases with the increasing flickering frequencies (2–50 Hz) and decreases at some higher frequencies (50–360 Hz). The amplitude of photocurrent induced by the nanogenerator reaches its highest value at a frequency of 50 Hz and is nearly 10 times larger than that at 2 Hz. This regulation of photocurrent has also been reported in other bR-based photoelectric systems, whereas the nanogenerator herein displays a higher maximum frequency.9,29 This is because the ballistic transport of electrons in CNTs can accelerate electron transport and accumulation, which results in faster adsorption of H+ ions on the surface of CNTs; thus, the photocycle process of bR shortens and then the light convention enhances in the whole device. This is a typical coupling effect for proton and electron transport.30,31 Moreover, the device with a low density of CNTs (Sample B) shows the same tendency in Fig. S15;† this indicates a good repeatability of the frequency regulation effect. The controllable photocurrent of the nanogenerator shows its potential for applications in various bio-systems with different natural frequencies.

Operating mechanism of the nanogenerator
Based on the experimental observations, we further proposed a H+ releasing model of the nanogenerator, as demonstrated in Fig. 1c. It is proven that the generation of photocurrent is related to the proton pump and reprotonation process in bR molecules induced by light, which has been reported in some previous studies.26,44–46 The proton pump process corresponds to the release of protons onto the purple membrane in the EC side, whereas the reprotonation process refers to transport of protons to the CP side. When a beam of light is incident on the bR protein, the proton pump process begins and generates H+ ions, which are absorbed on the surface of CNTs. These H+ ions attract electrons to accumulate on the bR side of CNTs in a short time (as shown by the orange arrows in Fig. 1c), and a forward current appears. With H+ ions being saturated, the photocurrent returns to the basic level, which matches the curves very well in Fig. 3b. The whole transport process of H+ ions is shown in Fig. S16.† The photocurrent reaches the highest value with the release of H+ ions and returns to the basic level when the release process of H+ ions stops. The reprotonation process can also be interpreted by this process, which results in a reversed photocurrent.
Moreover, the frequency-photocurrent dependence of the nanogenerator is related to the release and uptake of H+ ions.29 It is easy to understand that the peak value of the photocurrent is related to the maximum releasing speed of H+ (as shown in Fig. S16†). There are two main factors influencing the releasing speed of H+ ions: one is the concentration difference of H+ ions on both sides of the purple membrane, and the other is the increasing speed of the stimulating light power. When the stimulating light power density reaches the optimal value, the majority of bR molecules can generate protons; this results in the maximum releasing speed of H+ ions. This is the reason why the photocurrent becomes larger when the stimulating light power is increased at the same frequency of light (see Fig. S17† for details). Thus, when the frequency is relatively smaller (lower than 50 Hz, as shown in Fig. 5), the increase in frequency can accelerate the release of H+ ions, which results in an increase in the photocurrent (as shown in Fig. S17†). However, when the frequency is larger than 50 Hz, the photocycle of bR molecular cannot catch up with the quick switching speed of the stimulating light (blue line in Fig. S17†). In other words, before the release speed of H+ ions reaches the maximum slope, the proton pump process turns to the reprotonation process, which is the uptake of H+ ions. Therefore, the photocurrent will decrease with an increase in the frequency. This operating mechanism provides a rational approach to optimize the performance of biohybrid nanogenerators for applications in various bio-systems.
Conclusions
In summary, we proposed an electron–ion interaction mechanism to improve the speed of light power conversion in bR-based devices. As a demonstration, a novel cell-scale bio-nanogenerator for weak light power harvesting based on bR protein and aligned-long-CNTs was designed and investigated. The photocurrent of the nanogenerator changed from 0.53 nA cm−2 to 11 nA cm−2 with the light power density ranging from 0.03 mW cm−2 to 0.43 mW cm−2, showing a good linear relationship. While the light frequency increases, the photocurrent can reach its highest value of 99 nA cm−2 at the frequency of 50 Hz. The variation of the photocurrent induced by the light intensity and frequency was interpreted by depicting a H+ releasing model. This bio-nanogenerator presents a prototype example, showing an enhanced coupling effect of proton and electron transport and opening up a new path for the design of novel light conversion systems for power supply in bio-nanosystems.
Experimental
Fabrication of biohybrid nanogenerator
CNTs were grown on the surface of silicon wafer with an 800 nm oxide layer by the CVD method. Then, the photoresist (NR9-3000PY) was spin-coated on the substrate deposited with CNTs in two steps: one was 700 rpm for 9 s, and the other was 3000 rpm for 40 s, to prepare uniform and thickness controllable photoresist films. Cr/Au (2 nm/50 nm) was evaporated on it after the first step of photolithography. By the second step of photolithography, a square area of 3 mm × 3 mm was defined on the device. Finally, a reconstituted bR layer (10 μL, 1.2 mg mL−1) was then constructed on the surface of the square area through evaporation-induced assembly.
Synthesis of horizontally aligned CNTs
Horizontally aligned CNTs were synthesized through chemical vapor deposition (CVD) in a quartz tube (inner diameter: 50 mm), as reported in our previous studies.35,47,48 Silicon substrates with an 800 nm oxide layer were cleaned by ultrasonication in acetone, ethanol, and deionized water, successively, and used as substrates to grow horizontally aligned CNTs. FeCl3·6H2O was preloaded in the quartz tube and served as the catalyst precursor. After this, the substrates were heated to 965 °C in an Ar/H2 flow and kept for 10 min. Then, CH4 and a trace of H2O were introduced into the quartz tube for the growth of CNTs. After 20 min of reaction, the furnace was turned off and cooled naturally in the Ar/H2 flow.
Performance measurement of the biohybrid nanogenerator
A custom-designed photoelectric measuring system was built by assembling four instruments (Fig. S3†): xenon light source, optical attenuator, photochopper, and shielding box of probe station. A continuous-wavelength (CW) broadband light was introduced as the excitation sources from a tungsten lamp (PLS-SXE250). The optical attenuator will adjust the light intensity and also result in a small light spot. The light intensity was tested at the gate of the shielding box before the photo current generation experiment. The bio-nanogenerator was stimulated using the flicking light. Moreover, two probes were connected to the Cr/Au electrode and the Na2SO4 solution to detect the signal. The current signal was obtained using Agilent B1500.
