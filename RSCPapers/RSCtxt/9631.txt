A CoS/graphene‖activated carbon asymmetric supercapacitor fabricated in 2 M KOH solution exhibits a maximum energy density of 29 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 800 W kg−1, and a power density of 40.0 kW kg−1 (at the energy density of 11.0 Wh kg−1). Furthermore, 70% capacitance retention was obtained after 10000 cycles within the potential window of 0–1.6 V. The excellent performance of the CoS/graphene composites demonstrated in this work has revealed the promising potential of adopting the CoS/graphene hybrid network for high performance supercapacitors.
Introduction
Electrochemical capacitors (ECs), also called supercapacitors or ultracapacitors, are attractive technology for energy storage and conversion.1 Especially under the ever-more urgent pursuit of sustainable development and clean energy, the need for a suitable energy storage solution to accommodate load fluctuation from renewable energy sources, to offer larger power output for electricity-propelled vehicles, etc. has also culminated. Recently, intense research studies have been done across the globe on ECs to address this problem. This mania on EC research is mainly due to ECs' many appealing properties such as fast response, durable cycling ability and high power density.2 There are two capacitance domains that contribute to the overall capacitance performance of ECs, namely electro-static double-layer capacitance (EDLC) and pseudocapacitance.3 EDLC is featured by electro-static accumulation of surface charges and is commonly assigned to carbon-based electrode materials,4,5 while pseudocapacitance involves fast reversible faradaic charge transfer that takes place in electrode materials and combines the process of redox reactions. Transition-metal oxides and conductive polymers are notable materials for pseudocapacitors.6,7 Pseudocapacitors whose capacitance primarily derived from pseudocapacitance are similar to batteries in the process of charging and discharging, but usually the energy per mass stored in redox-active capacitors is smaller than that of batteries.8–10
Numerous research studies in ECs have been devoted to increasing energy density without compromising their major merits such as high power density or long life span.11 Towards this end, nanostructured materials received special attention in the field of EC research as they provide more reactive sites, shortened ion diffusion lengths and more efficient electron pathways, and usually nanostructured material can deliver improved cycle life.12–14 Recently, nanostructured transition metal sulfides have attracted extensive attention in ECs because they exhibit outstanding properties such as high redox activity and capacity.15,16 As an important family of metal sulfides, cobalt sulfides play a significant role in ECs. So far, amorphous CoS hollow polyhedral has been synthesized by utilizing hard templates showing a specific capacitance up to 1475 F g−1.17 Cobalt sulfide composited with graphene through a hydrothermal process demonstrated a specific capacitance of 1535 F g−1.18 Lately, a thin layer of cobalt sulfide was cathodically deposited on nickel foam exhibiting a specific capacitance of 1471 F g−1.19 However, all these attempts failed to further enhance the specific capacitance of cobalt sulfides, which could be due to inefficient surface contact between cobalt sulfides and conductive materials. The inefficient contact between redox-active species and charge transfer substrates will result in only partial cobalt sulfides participating in the energy storage process and thus inevitably dwarfs the capacitive and rate performance of the electrode.20,21 As a consequence of relatively undesirable conductivity of cobalt sulfides and sluggish charge transfer compared with carbon materials, fast electron conversion and discharge are hindered in cobalt sulfides.
To solve these problems, we report a simple and green two-step electrodeposition process to generate CoS/graphene composites in the form of 3D conductive networks, in which CoS is anchored and well-wrapped by the epitaxially grown conductive graphene matrix, as shown in Fig. 1.22 During the electrodeposition, graphene oxide (GO) solution was used as the precursor solution and was simultaneously electrochemically reduced and deposited on and between CoS nanosheets (Fig. S1C, ESI†), acting as a support for the CoS sheet structure while CoS nanosheets in-turn facilitate the growth of the graphene matrix and prohibit graphene layer re-stacking.23 One of the advantages of this composite material is that the nanosheet-like CoS is tightly anchored and wrapped by the graphene layer and the two different materials species are nicely integrated together. The novel composites exhibit excellent capacitance performance (3785 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1) and rate performance (82% retention at 20 A g−1). The high capacitance of the novel CoS@eRG (eRG stands for electrochemically reduced graphene) electrode material is unprecedented. To test the device performance of the composite material, asymmetric ECs assembled by taking CoS@eRG as the positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as the negative electrode were analyzed in 2 M KOH aqueous electrolyte solution. The as-assembled ECs show an energy density of 29.0 Wh kg−1 (at the power density of 0.8 kW kg−1) and a power density of 40.0 kW kg−1 (at the energy density of 11.0 Wh kg−1) which are among the highest reported values of related materials to the best of our knowledge. These asymmetric ECs exhibit a voltage region of 0–1.6 V and reasonable cycling performance of 70% capacitance retention over 10000 cycles.

Experimental
Materials
All the chemicals were of analytical grade and used without further purification. Thiourea (TU) was purchased from Guangfu Chemical Co. (Tianjin, China), cobalt chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2·6H2O) from Bodi Chemical Co. (Tianjin, China), lithium perchlorate (LiClO4·3H2O) and nickel sheet from Sinopharm Co. (Shanghai, China). Graphene oxide water solution was obtained from Hengqiu Tech (Suzhou, China) and nickel foam from Lifeixin (Shenzhen, China). Activated carbon and carbon black were acquired from Xinxing (Shenyang, China) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) emulsion from Daikin (Changshu, China). Absolute ethanol, hydrochloric acid and deionized water were used as detergent.
Synthesis of CoS electrodes
All the electrochemical experiments (electrodeposition and supercapacitor measurements) were performed on an IviumStat Electrochemical Workstation (Netherlands), with a three-electrode configuration consisting of a graphite rod as the counter electrode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode, and a working electrode. The working electrode was fabricated on Ni foam. Prior to electrochemical deposition, Ni foam was cut into pieces of 10 × 30 mm2 and ultrasonically cleaned in 3 M HCl, deionized water and absolute ethanol successively. A 50 ml mixed solution of 5 mM CoCl2·6H2O and 0.75 M TU was used as deposition bath. The nanostructured cobalt sulfide film was deposited onto 2 cm2 Ni foam by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a potential interval from −1.24 to 0.16 V vs. SCE with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 for seven cycles (Fig. S1A†). The deposited electrode was allowed to undergo ion exchange with deionized water for 1 h before being rinsed and dried at 60 °C for 10 h in a vacuum oven. The mass of CoS deposited on the Ni form is 0.8 mg. The electrochemical reactions that involved in the deposition process could be described by following equations: 2H2O + 2e− → 2OH− + H2(1) SC(NH2)2 + 2OH− → S2− + OC(NH2)2 + H2O(2) Co2+ + S2− → CoS(3)
Synthesis of CoS@eRG electrodes
A 0.1 M LiClO4 aqueous solution containing 0.7 mg ml−1 graphene oxide (GO) was used as the electrolyte for graphene electrodeposition. The as-prepared CoS electrode was used as a working electrode. The deposition of electrochemically reduced graphene (eRG) was carried out by a potentiostatic method under a constant potential of −1.2 V vs. SCE for 180 s. After deposition, the electrode was rinsed with deionized water several times and then immersed in deionized water for 1 h. Subsequently, the electrode was further reduced at −1.2 V vs. SCE for another 60 s in 1 M LiClO4 solution (Fig. S1B†). Eventually, the as prepared CoS@eRG electrode was washed with deionized water and dried at 60 °C overnight. The mass of CoS/eRG composites deposited on the Ni form is 0.9 mg.
Fabrication of CoS@eRG‖AC asymmetric electrochemical capacitors
In a typical activated carbon (AC) electrode preparation, 50 mg activated carbon and 7 mg carbon black were finely mixed in an agate mortar and 10 μl polytetrafluoroethylene (5 wt%) was added to the mixture as a binder (morphology of AC is shown in Fig. S8D†). Then the mixture was ground to form uniform slurry, coated onto 2 cm2 Ni foam and pressed into a sheet under 10 MPa by using a tablet press. Finally it was dried overnight at 80 °C under vacuum and served as a negative electrode. The asymmetric electrochemical capacitor (a-EC) cells were assembled by using CoS@eRG as the positive electrode, AC as the negative electrode and porous polypropylene membrane as the separator. In order to obtain a charge balance between the two electrodes, q+ = q− should be satisfied (q+ is the positive charge and q− is the negative charge). The charge stored by each electrode should follow: q = C × ΔE × m, where C (F g−1) is the specific capacitance of an electrode, ΔE (V) is the potential window during the discharge process and m (g) is the mass of an electrode. Given the specific capacitance of each material, the optimized mass ratio of m+/m− in the a-EC should be 0.08 (detailed calculation is included in the ESI†).
Measurements and characterization
The crystal structure of CoS@eRG was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Rigaku D/MAX-2400) with Cu Kα radiation. A transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai-20, 200 kV) and field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, NOVANano SEM 450, 3 kV) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (OXFORD INSTRUMENTS X-MAX 50 mm2) were used to investigate the microstructure and morphology of the synthesized electrode materials. Raman spectra were also taken on a Thermoscientific DXR Raman microscope at 532 nm (1 mW). FT-IR spectra of KBr powder pressed pellets were taken on a Thermo Fisher Scientific Nicolet 6700 Flex spectrometer. The electronic structure of the CoS@eRG was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi, Mono Al Kα). Thermogravimetric analysis was carried out by using a Pyris Diamond TG/DTA (Perkin-Elmer).
The CoS@eRG working electrodes were tested in the IviumStat three electrode system containing 2 M KOH as the electrolyte. Galvanostatic charge/discharge and cyclic voltammetric (CV) tests were performed on the IviumStat Electrochemical Workstation. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were also recorded under an open circuit potential with an AC turbulence voltage amplitude of 5 mV in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz. The gravimetric specific capacitance of the electrode was calculated from the constant current charge/discharge curves according to the following equation: C = IΔt/mΔV where I (A) is the discharge current, Δt (s) is the discharge time, m (g) is the mass of the electroactive materials and ΔV (V) is the discharge voltage range.
For the CoS@eRG‖AC asymmetric electrochemical capacitors, a two-electrode cell configuration containing 2 M KOH electrolyte was investigated on a LAND-CT2001A battery testing system (Wuhan, China). The specific capacitance of a-EC (Ca-EC, F g−1), energy density (E, Wh kg−1) and power density (P, W kg−1) were calculated according to the following equations: where I (A) is the discharge current, Δt (s) is the discharge time, ma-EC (g) is the total mass of electroactive materials on both electrodes and ΔV (V) is the discharge voltage. Ca-EC = IΔt/ma-ECΔV(4) E = Ca-ECΔV2/2(5) P = E/Δt(6)
Results and discussion
Throughout this section, CoS@eRG synthesized by the typical method (as described in the Experimental section) will be discussed unless special instructions are given. The morphologies and structures of CoS@eRG were investigated by using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM), as shown in Fig. 2. The FE-SEM image in Fig. 2A shows that the Ni foam is uniformly coated by the CoS@eRG film. The film is about 1 μm thick, which was confirmed by the cross section FE-SEM image in Fig. S2B.† In addition, both the FE-SEM images of low-resolution Fig. 2B and high-resolution Fig. 2C show that the 3D porous hybrid CoS@eRG network with open channels were successfully constructed by electrodeposition. Furthermore, the existence of interlaced CoS nanosheets was confirmed by TEM, as shown in Fig. 2D. Noteworthily, the inset in Fig. 2D shows that graphene sheets grow tightly onto the cross-linked CoS nanosheets.

High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) measurements were utilized to further characterize the as-prepared CoS@eRG composite. Fig. 3A demonstrates that CoS nanosheets and graphene are mutually supported on each other, indicating a strong chemical and physical bonding. Moreover, both Fig. 3A and B show that CoS nanosheets are seamlessly coupled with graphene sheets, demonstrating intimate interfacial contact between the two. It is important that efficient contact between the CoS and graphene matrix is perfectly established, since a good contact will facilitate fast charge transfer and fulfill the potential of individual materials, and vice versa bad contact would not provide necessary charge/mass transfer needed to harness buried potentials of each components. The lattice spacing of CoS is 0.25 nm revealed by Fig. 3B, corresponding to the (101) planes of hexagonal CoS (PDF 65-0407). This result agrees well with the XRD patterns shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), in which the CoS@eRG film with highly preferred orientation along the (101) plane is confirmed. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (inset of Fig. 3B) reveals that CoS of the composite is not single crystalline structured.

To further investigate the distribution of CoS and graphene species in the hybrid composite, energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping was used to characterize the CoS@eRG composite scratched from Ni foil. Fig. 3C shows a typical HRTEM image combined with EDS mapping images in the same area. It is clear that the dark area of the HRTEM image shows the higher distribution intensity of cobalt and sulfur while comparing it with the Co, S mappings. The C mapping exhibits that carbon is uniformly distributed throughout the dark and light area, further indicating that graphene was epitaxially grown on interlaced CoS nanosheets. The EDS mapping of the CoS@eRG film on Ni foam is also available in Fig. S4 (ESI†).

Fig. 4A shows the FT-IR spectra of CoS@eRG and graphene oxide, in which CoS@eRG was scratched from Ni foil and graphene oxide (GO) was obtained after evaporation of graphene oxide solution. FT-IR spectra of GO present CO (νCO, 1740 cm−1), C–OH (νC–OH, 1398 cm−1), epoxy C–O–C (νC–O–C, 1166 cm−1), and alkoxy C–O (νC–O, 1061 cm−1) stretching vibration.24–26 Two peaks at about 3400 cm−1 and 1630 cm−1 are attributed to the O–H stretching and bending vibrations of the absorbed water and C–OH groups. The absorption of CoS@eRG at 1740 cm−1 disappears and absorption at 1117 cm−1 indicates that CO groups were successfully reduced into epoxy or alkoxy groups. The Raman spectra of CoS@eRG and GO in Fig. 4B exhibit two diagnostic peaks of D and G at 1350 cm−1 and 1593 cm−1, in which the D and G band correspond to the breathing mode of κ-point phonons of A1g symmetry (defects located at the edges) and E2g phonons (motion of sp2 carbons) of graphene, respectively.27–29 The crystal structure of ordered/disordered carbonaceous composites could be quantified by the ID/IG peak intensity ratio of the Raman spectrum.30 As shown in Fig. 4B, the ID/IG ratio decreased from 1.00 for the GO to 0.79 for the CoS@eRG indicating that lower disorders and defects of graphene platelets after electrochemical reduction. This could be due to the fact that higher degree of graphitization of the nanosheets is formed during the electrochemical reduction.30

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to quantify the amount of graphene in the CoS/graphene composites. The sample was scratched from Ni foil, and was heated from room temperature to 850 °C at a rate of 5 °C min−1 in air, as shown in Fig. 4C. Several stages of weight loss for CoS/graphene could be attributed to the evaporation of free moisture (at 50 °C), the removal of sulphur and phase transformation of cobalt sulphides to oxides (at 100–400 °C), and the depletion of graphene (at 650–750 °C) subsequently. The slight weight increase at 600–650 °C could probably be ascribed to the oxidation of nickel sprinkles scratched off together with CoS/graphene composites from Ni foil. As expected, the weight loss (about 11%) from 650 °C to 750 °C is due to the oxidation of graphene, which agrees well with the measured weight reported in the Experimental section.
To investigate the electronic structure of the deposited composition, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were utilized. The complete survey spectrum of the electrochemically deposited CoS@eRG film is displayed in Fig. 5A. The survey spectrum shows that the deposited film consists of C, S, O and Co elements. Fig. 5B shows the high-resolution spectrum of C1s, in which the C1s spectrum was curve fitted by three peaks. The main peak at 284.8 eV can be ascribed to sp2-hybridized carbon atoms indicating that the majority of the carbon atoms in graphene nanosheets are in a conjugated honeycomb lattice.31 The other two peaks can be assigned to two functional groups of carbon: carboxylate carbon (O–CO, 289.0 eV) and alkoxy carbon (C–O, 286.3 eV), indicating the residual of oxygen containing groups.32Fig. 5C shows the Co2p3/2 XPS spectrum exhibiting a broad peak with a binding energy ranging from 777.5 to 789 eV. It was curve fitted by three main peaks and a satellite peak. The three main peaks are at 780.0 eV, 781.7 eV and 783.6 eV, and the satellite peak is at 787.2 eV, indicating the presence of cobalt(II) and cobalt(III) in the composites, while the excitation satellite peak can be considered as evidence for the existence of cobalt(II).33,34 Moreover, Fig. 5D illustrates the sulfur S2p2/3 peak at the binding energy of 163.3 eV indicating the deposited film composed of S2−.35 Noteworthily, the appearance of additional peaks at about 166–171 eV in Fig. 5D could be ascribed to the inconsequential amount of CoxSy (x = 1, 2…4; y = 1, 2…9) compounds, because the deposited cobalt sulfide is a non-stoichiometric compound.36 As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the main Raman peak in the range of 0–1000 cm−1 was curve fitted by six small peaks, in which three green peaks appeared at 474, 516 and 679 cm−1 representing the formation of the CoS phase.

Electrochemical performances of the as-prepared CoS@eRG electrodes were studied in a three-electrode cell in 2 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. And a control experiment was also conducted by testing CoS electrodes (deposited by 7 CV scans) without the deposition of graphene. The cyclic voltammograms (CV) and specific capacitances of the two electrodes are shown in Fig. 6A and B. Fig. 6A shows that CoS electrodes exhibit low electric current response compared with the CoS@eRG electrodes. Moreover, Fig. 6B demonstrates that CoS@eRG electrodes hold much enhanced specific capacitance performance compared with those of CoS. Generally, cobalt sulfide materials are insufficient to support fast electron transport in faradic redox reactions, especially under large current density.37 The boosted performance of graphene based electrodes could be due to the well-connected electrically conducting graphene matrix which serves as electronic super-highways that provide fast charge transfer during the charging/discharging processes.38 In order to confirm the improved conductivity of the CoS@eRG electrodes, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was analyzed utilizing Nyquist plots (Fig. 6C). The plots can be fitted into an equivalent circuit as shown in the inset of Fig. 6C, where Rb is series resistances of the electrochemical system, Cdl is double-layer capacitance, Rct is faradic charge transfer resistance, and W is diffusive resistance (Warburg impedance).29,39 In the high frequency region, the intersection of the curve at the real axis represents Rb.40 Compared with CoS (0.77 Ω), the Rb of CoS@eRG electrodes is only 0.50 Ω, suggesting that the introduction of the graphene matrix decreased the total resistances (ionic resistance, intrinsic resistance and contact resistance) of the electrochemical system and improved the surface contact between CoS and conductive materials. As displayed, the Nyquist plots of the two electrodes exhibit negligible semicircular shapes in the high frequency range which relate to the faradic charge transfer resistance (Rct), suggesting that both electrodes possess excellent interfacial charge transfer efficiency.41 In the low frequency range, the slopes of curves represent the Warburg impedance and approaching a 90° means negligible diffusive resistance.42 The CoS@eRG electrodes possess a more vertical line validating its better capacitive behavior with more desirable diffusion properties. Therefore the EIS data confirmed that the deposited CoS/graphene interlaced nanosheets showed improved electrical conductivity compared with the original CoS nanosheets. The integration of graphene metamorphoses CoS@eRG into ideal electrode materials for supercapacitors.

To compare the electroactive surface areas of CoS and CoS@eRG electrodes, cyclic voltammetric data of both electrodes were analyzed by utilizing the Randles–Sevcik equation: i = (2.69 × 105)n3/2AD1/2v1/2C, where i (A) refers to the peak current, n refers to the number of electrons transferred during the redox reaction, A (cm2) refers to the effective electroactive surface area, D (cm2 s−1) refers to the diffusion coefficient, v (V s−1) refers to the scan rate, and C (mol cm−3) refers to the concentration of the electrolyte.43–45 As both electrodes undergo the same redox reaction in the same 2 M KOH solution, the electron transfer number, diffusion coefficient and concentration of KOH are the same. Thus, i is mainly affected by the scan rate and electroactive surface area. Fig. 6D displays the relationship between the anodic/cathodic peak current and scan rate for both CoS and CoS@eRG electrodes. The anodic/cathodic peak currents were read from the CV curves of the two electrodes, which are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). During the cathodic process, the normalized effective electrode area of CoS@eRG is 1.76 times greater than that of CoS.46 It is reasonable to conclude that an increased electroactive surface area can be achieved by electrochemical deposition of the graphene matrix onto CoS nanosheets.

Fig. 6E shows the CV curves of the CoS@eRG electrode, in which the current responses have been converted to specific capacitance using the equation: C = I/vm where I (A) is the measured current response, v (V s−1) and m (g) stands for the scan rate and the mass of the active material, respectively. Notably, there are two pairs of redox peaks in all CV curves of CoS@eRG which could be attributed to the following redox reactions: CoS + OH− ↔ CoSOH + e− (lower potential), and CoSOH + OH− ↔ CoSO + H2O + e− (higher potential).47 The symmetric redox peaks in the CV curves suggest high reversibility of the faradic redox reactions. An increased polarization could also be observed as the potential difference between the peaks of reduction and oxidation goes up with the increase of the scan rate.48 This widening of peak potential differences could be caused by charge transfer kinetics being the rate limiting step of the electrode reaction.49
To further evaluate the specific capacitance and cyclic performance of CoS@eRG electrodes, the charge/discharge and cycling stability measurements were performed. Fig. 6F depicts the galvanostatic charge/discharge behavior of the CoS@eRG electrodes between −0.1 to 0.4 V at various current densities. The specific capacitance of the electrodes is 3386, 3163, 2994, 2808 and 2653 F g−1, and the area capacitance is 1.52, 1.42, 1.34, 1.26 and 1.19 F cm−2 at the current densities of 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 A g−1, respectively. Remarkably, the electrodes still maintain a specific capacitance of 2653 F g−1 even at a high current density of 20 A g−1. Such high rate capability indicates great performance of CoS@eRG electrodes in practical application. The cycling stability of the electrodes was measured under galvanostatic charge/discharge mode in a potential window of −0.1 to 0.4 V over 2500 cycles at current densities of 10 and 30 A g−1, respectively. The specific capacitance drastically decreases initially and then increases gently during the first 200 cycles at a current density of 10 A g−1, as shown in Fig. 6G. The slight enhancement of the electrode performance could be ascribed to the enlargement of the electrochemical active volume of CoS and graphene caused by the insertion and extraction of ions in the initial cycles.50 The gradual decrease of specific capacitance for 500 to 2500 cycles could be attributed to the gradual degradation of structural integrity and loosened adhesion between CoS and graphene during long-term cycling. Despite the downward trend of capacitance retention, it is inspiring that the electrode still exhibits a specific capacitance of 1056 F g−1 after 2500 cycles at a high current density of 10 A g−1, showcasing its capability for high-rate supercapacitors.
To obtain optimized CoS@eRG electrodes, three kinds of electrodes synthesized under different parameters were prepared. Synthetic parameters N, c, t, m, C represent the cycle numbers of cyclic voltammetry used during the electrodeposition of CoS, concentration of the GO solution (mg ml−1), electrochemical reduction time (s) for GO, the mass loading on electrodes and specific capacitance of electrodes, respectively. As shown in Fig. 7A, electrodes with different CoS@eRG mass loadings were fabricated by controlling cyclic voltammetry scan cycles (N), concentration of the GO solution (c) and potentiostatic reduction time (t) (Fig. S7† with a higher deposited mass). The ratio of CoS to graphene in all the three electrodes was controlled to be the same, in which the mass of CoS was estimated by parameter N and graphene was estimated by c × t roughly. All samples exhibit specific capacitances of 3785, 3386 and 3186 F g−1, respectively. The capacitance performance can be improved by increasing the CV scans from 3 to 7, while keeping the concentration of GO solution as the same. And it can also be improved by increasing the concentration of GO solution from 0.7 to 1.0 mg ml−1, while keeping the CV scans as the same. The best electrode (represented by the yellow line) exhibits a capacitance of 3785 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, which was fabricated by 7 CV scans (N = 7) with a reduction time of 120 s (t = 120) in 1 mg ml−1 GO (c = 1) solution. The rate performance of the best electrode is displayed in Fig. 7B. The electrode retains a high specific capacitance of 2000 F g−1 even at a high current density of 100 A g−1, indicating that electrochemical deposition is quite promising for the low cost fabrication of nanostructured electrodes in high-performance pseudocapacitors.

To demonstrate the CoS@eRG electrodes for practical application, an asymmetric electrochemical capacitor (a-EC) device was assembled by taking activated carbon as the negative electrode and CoS@eRG as the positive electrode in 2 M KOH electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetric measurements were carried out for both electrodes in a three-electrode configuration, as shown in Fig. 8A. The AC electrode was measured in a potential window of −1.2 to −0.1 V (vs. SCE), and CoS@eRG in a potential window of −0.1 to 0.4 V (vs. SCE). Fig. 8A shows that the CV curves of the two electrodes exhibit a nearly identical enveloped area indicating a perfect charge balance between the two coupling electrodes. On the basis of these results, a stable a-EC was assembled with a voltage window between 0 and 1.6 V. CV curves of the a-EC at various scan rates are shown in Fig. 8B, in which the current–potential response is dependent on the potential indicating a faradaic process.51Fig. 8C and D exhibit galvanostatic charge–discharge voltage curves and specific capacitances of the a-EC calculated from the charge–discharge curves, respectively. The specific capacitance decreases with the increase of the current density, which is caused by non-deal diffusion conditions that allow a limited amount of electrolyte ions to reach the active surface within a given time, resulting in low utilization of electroactive materials.44,51 As shown in Fig. 8E, the asymmetric cell shows capacitance retention of 70% after successive 10000 cycles in 25 days. These results suggest that CoS@eRG electrodes are quite practical and stable in the two-electrode full cell configuration. In addition, the Ragone plot related to the specific energy and specific power of the a-EC is shown in Fig. 8F. The a-EC displays the energy density from 29 to 11 Wh kg−1 at the power density from 0.8 to 40 kW kg−1. To the best of our knowledge these results are superior to the previously reported asymmetric system without graphene: Ni–Co sulfide‖AC (25 Wh kg−1, 3.5 kW kg−1).52 To better assess the performance of the as-prepared a-EC, information on other asymmetric supercapacitor systems is available in the ESI† for the purpose of comparison. The experimental results demonstrate that CoS@eRG electrodes are promising candidates with distinctive features for practical energy storage.

Conclusion
In summary, we have successfully developed a novel electrochemical deposition synthesis of 3D nanostructured cobalt sulfide anchored by a conductive graphene matrix with excellent electrochemical performance. In addition, the rationally designed CoS@eRG nanocomposite exhibits an amazing specific capacitance of 3785 F g−1. This could be ascribed to the synergetic effect induced by the structure matching of CoS and graphene due to their topological similarities as both of them are two dimensional sheet-like materials in this work. Moreover, the asymmetric electrochemical capacitor CoS@eRG‖AC still displays an energy density of 20 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 800 W kg−1 after 10000 cycles. The cycling stability is ascribed to the introduction of the conductive graphene matrix that not only increases the conductivity but also buffers the volume changes of CoS nanosheets during the charging/discharging processes. Such an effective and convenient synthesis method to fabricate 3D conductive electrode materials with improved rate capability and specific capacitance could be potentially applied to a wide range of energy storage and conversion applications such as high performance dye-sensitized solar cells, photoelectrochemical catalysis and Li-ion batteries.
