    , Accepted 17th June 2017First published on 20th June 2017AbstractPhotodetectors which can work at both low and high temperatures are very important for the development of practical optoelectronic devices. Many studies have shown that low-dimensional semiconductors have more advantages in optoelectronic applications than their bulk forms. Here, we report the preparation of high-quality Sb2S3 nanowires (NWs) by a sulphur-assisted vapour transport method. The corresponding individual Sb2S3 NW based photodetectors exhibit good photoresponse in a wide spectral range from about 300 to 800 nm. The optimal photoresponse values are measured under the illumination of a 638 nm laser at room temperature: a high current ON/OFF ratio of about 210, a spectral responsivity of 1152 A W−1, a detectivity of 2 × 1013 Jones, and rise and fall times of about 37 ms, respectively. More importantly, the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity of Sb2S3 shows three variation regions which can be attributed to the interaction between the carrier mobility and carrier concentration. The temperature dependence of the photoresponse of the photodetectors shows that they have good adaptability to temperature, and they worked very well at a wide temperature range from 8 to 420 K. Our results indicate that low-dimensional Sb2S3 crystals are promising candidates for new multifunctional optoelectronic devices.
Introduction
As a kind of photonic device, photodetectors which can convert optical signals into electrical signals have been widely investigated due to their potential applications in both commercial and scientific fields, especially in video imaging, optical communication, environmental monitoring, security surveillance and biomedical sensors.1–7 For these practical applications, the photodetectors should work at low bias voltages and currents, be reliable under the required operating conditions, have high sensitivity and response speed, and have low noise.8 Studies have shown that low-dimensional semiconductors have some unique physical and chemical properties, compared to their bulk forms.1,7,9–12 In the past few decades, because of the high surface-to-volume ratio and quantum confinement effect, V–VI semiconductor nanowires (NWs) have attracted extensive interest and have been considered as the most promising fundamental building blocks for high-performance photodetectors and other optoelectronic devices.9–14 For example, photodetectors with a high spectrum responsivity of about 8261.4 A W−1 have been achieved in Sb–Bi–Se NWs;13 bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3) nanowire-based photodetectors show a very fast response time of about 10 μs;14 antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) solar cells exhibit an EQE higher than 80% and an efficiency of 5.6%.15 However, some drawbacks still exist in these materials, which severely restrict their practical applications in optoelectronic devices. So, developing new photodetectors with excellent comprehensive performances which can operate well under different harsh conditions is highly needed.
As a kind of layer-structured semiconductor, orthorhombic antimony sulfide (Sb2S3) consists of two infinite ribbons (Sb4S6)n along the c-axis, which are weakly bound by van der Waals forces in the b-direction. The infinite ribbon consists of two different types of chains: distorted tetragonal pyramids and trigonal pyramids.16,17 This structural anisotropy could lead to the growth of crystals with a specific morphology. Low-dimensional crystals of Sb2S3, such as nanorods, nanotubes, nanoribbons, and nanowires have been prepared by solvothermal treatment, chemical vapour deposition, and template-based methods.18–23 Meanwhile, Sb2S3 has a direct bandgap of 1.5–2.2 eV depending on its size and morphology;18,19,24 it also exhibits excellent photoconductivity. These properties make it a promising candidate for advanced opto/electronic devices, such as solar cells, photodetectors, and so on. Some recent studies also highlight its potential applications in electronics. For example, Choi et al. and Zimmermann et al. showed that Sb2S3 based solar cells have good performances.25,26 Sb2S3/sulfur-doped graphene anodes (Sb2S3/SGS) with high specific capacity (792.8 mA h g−1 at 0.05 A g−1), good rate capability (591.6 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1), and excellent cycle life (83.0% capacity retention for 900 cycles at 2 A g−1) have been achieved by Xiong et al.27 Ferroelectric and piezoelectric switching behaviors have been observed in c-axis-oriented Sb2S3 nanowires.22 In addition, nanostructured Sb2S3 crystals are also considered as promising materials for high-performance photodetectors.24,28 Nevertheless, for practical applications, the performance of Sb2S3 based photodetectors still needs to be improved.
In this work, we report the preparation of Sb2S3 NWs with high quality by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, room-temperature photoluminescence and transmission electron microscopy techniques by using a sulphur-assisted vapour transport method. Meanwhile, high-performance photodetectors are also fabricated based on individual Sb2S3 NWs. They show photoresponse in a wide spectral range from about 300 nm to 800 nm. The typical device reveals an optimal spectral responsivity of 1152 A W−1, a high current ON/OFF ratio about 210, a detectivity of 2 × 1013 Jones, as well as fast rise and decay times (τr ≈ 37 ms and τf ≈ 38 ms, respectively), which were measured under the illumination of a 638 nm laser at room temperature. Moreover, we also studied the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity of Sb2S3 NWs. We find that the changes in the electrical conductivity show three obvious trends which are mainly due to the interaction between the carrier mobility and carrier concentration. In addition, the Sb2S3 NWs also show excellent photoresponse properties in a wide temperature range from 8 K to 420 K. All these results imply that Sb2S3 NW photodetectors are potential candidates for practical applications in micro/nanoscale optoelectronics.
Results and discussion
As shown in Fig. S1,† the products grown on an SiO2/Si substrate are wire-like crystals with diameters larger than 50 nm and lengths larger than one hundred micrometers. The crystallographic phase of the crystals was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fig. 1a shows the detailed results of XRD measurement, all of the diffraction peaks can be indexed to the orthorhombic Sb2S3 structure (ICSD no. 87-1135), and no secondary phases are observed which indicate the high purity of the prepared Sb2S3 crystals. In addition, the peaks have high intensity and a small value of full width at half maximum (FWHM), indicating that the as-prepared crystals have high crystallization quality. Studies have shown that the morphology of the prepared crystals is strongly dependent on their crystal structures. As schematically shown in Fig. 1b, two infinite ribbons (Sb4S6)n stack along the c-axis through strong covalent Sb–S bonds, whereas in the b-axis the (Sb4S6)n ribbons are held together by van der Waals forces. The shortest interatomic distances between the (Sb4S6)n ribbons in the b-axis are about 1.5 times larger than those between the ribbons in the c-axis.16 So, bulk crystals can be easily exfoliated into their few-layer forms along the (010) plane. Meanwhile, during the growth of Sb2S3 crystals, this structural anisotropy could result in a preferential growth of wire-like crystals. Raman spectroscopy has been widely used in the study of structure-related properties since the vibrational information is specific to the chemical bonds and symmetry of crystals. The Raman spectrum of the as-prepared Sb2S3 crystals is shown in Fig. 1c, and six peaks at 124.8, 154.6, 188.7, 239, 282.2, and 305.1 cm−1 are observed, which is in good agreement with a previous report.29 The room-temperature photoluminescence (PL) properties of the as-prepared Sb2S3 crystals have also been investigated, as depicted in Fig. 1d. The diameter of this measured nanowire is about 59.6 nm, which is confirmed by AFM (Fig. S2†). A strong PL emission at about 785 nm is observed. So, the corresponding optical band-gap of this Sb2S3 crystal is 1.58 eV, which corresponds well with previous work.18,19,24

The crystal structure and chemical stoichiometry of Sb2S3 crystals were further studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Fig. 2a shows a low-magnification TEM image of the typical Sb2S3 NWs, it can be observed that they have very smooth surfaces. The HRTEM of the Sb2S3 crystals is shown in Fig. 2b. The lattice spacing is about 5.32 Å, which corresponds to the (120) plane. Their crystallinity is further confirmed by the SAED patterns. The SAED result (Fig. 2c) shows a spot pattern which is well consistent with a high quality and orthorhombic structured single crystal. Meanwhile, it also can be observed that the preferential growth of Sb2S3 crystals occurs along the [001] direction. Fig. 2d–f show the EDX elemental mappings of a typical Sb2S3 NW. As can be seen, Sb and S are homogeneously distributed across the whole crystal. Fig. 2g shows the collected EDX spectrum. The result reveals that the crystal is composed of S and Sb (the detected Cu element originates from the copper grid) and the stoichiometric ratio of Sb and S is about 2:3.

In order to study the optoelectronic properties of the as-prepared Sb2S3 NWs, individual Sb2S3 NW-based photodetectors were fabricated on a SiO2/Si substrate (Si substrate with a 300 nm SiO2 insulating top layer) by the lithography and metal electrode evaporation process (see the Experimental section). In this work, six devices have been prepared. All of them exhibit reproducible and excellent photoresponse in a wide spectral range from about 300 to 800 nm. The inset picture in Fig. 3a shows the optical microscopy image of a typical photodetector. The AFM image of a typical photodetector is shown in Fig. S2,† and the atomic force microscopy height topography shows that the diameter of this typical photodetector is about 59.6 nm. Fig. 3a shows the current versus voltage (I–V) curves measured under the illumination of lasers with different wavelengths (450 nm, 532 nm, and 638 nm, the fixed light power intensity is 45.2 mW cm−2) and under dark conditions. The current linearly increased with the voltage in I–V curves, indicating good Ohmic contact behavior between the Au electrodes and Sb2S3 NWs. Meanwhile, it can also be seen that the electric conductance of this photodetector is obviously dependent on the illuminated light wavelengths. To understand the detailed wavelength dependent spectral response, the photocurrent of this device under continuously changing wavelengths from 200 to 1100 nm at a bias voltage of 1 V is measured. The results show that the photodetector has a wide-band spectral response from 300 nm to 800 nm (Fig. S3†). The maximum value of photocurrent appears at the wavelength of 710 nm, and the cutoff wavelength is about 800 nm. Here, we choose three typical lasers (450, 532, and 638 nm), by which their power intensity can be continuously adjusted, to study the detailed photoelectric properties of our photodetector. The corresponding results have been given in Fig. S4† (for a 450 nm laser), Fig. S5† (for 532 nm laser), and Fig. 3b–f (for a 638 nm laser). Fig. 3b shows the result of the photoelectric response to the illumination of a 638 nm laser with the power density ranging from 0.03 mW cm−2 to 45.2 mW cm−2. The photocurrent of this device shows strong dependence on light intensity; the current increases with the increasing light intensity. The corresponding light intensity dependence of the photocurrent can be expressed by a power law of I ∝ αPβ(1)where I is the photocurrent measured at a voltage of 1 V, α is a scaling constant, P is the light power intensity, and β is an exponent which represents the response of the photocurrent to light-intensity, respectively.7 The results show that the values of β are strongly dependent on the wavelength of illuminated lasers (Fig. S4b, S5b,† and Fig. 3c). The calculated values of β are 0.45, 0.61, and 0.18, corresponding to the illumination of 450, 532, and 638 nm lasers, respectively. The effect of photogenerated carriers on the photoconductance of the semiconductor is greatly influenced by the traps and other defect states. The value of β directly reflects the response capability of the device to a specific wavelength of light. The photogenerated carriers excited by the photons with small energy first fill the impurity level which was formed in a position between the conduction band and the valence band. That is to say, the photocarriers are captured by the traps and other defect states. So, the photons with small energy have little contribution to the conductance, resulting in a small β value.

Spectral responsivity (Rλ) is a key parameter to evaluate the performance of a photodetector, and it is defined as the photocurrent generated per unit power of incident light on the effective area of a device. Rλ can be calculated by using the following equations: Rλ = Iλ/PλS(2)where Iλ is the photocurrent, Pλ is the incident light intensity and S is the effective illuminated area. Fig. 3d shows the light power density of 638 nm laser dependence of the Rλ, measured at a bias voltage of 1 V. Remarkably, Rλ of this photodetector reaches about 1152 A W−1 at a light power intensity of 0.03 mW cm−2 for a 638 nm laser. Moreover, Rλ decreases gradually with the increasing of light power intensity from 0.03 to 45.2 mW cm−2, which is mainly due to the traps and other defect states in materials. The same trends are also found under the illumination of a 450 nm laser (Fig. S4c†) and a 532 nm laser (Fig. S5c†). The detailed comparison has been listed in Table 1. Another important parameter for evaluating the performance of a photodetector is specific detectivity (D*), which can be expressed by the function (3)where Rλ is the spectral responsivity, Id is the dark current, S is the effective illuminated area, and e is the electronic charge. It can be seen from Fig. 3d and Fig. S4c, S5c† that the changes of detectivity with the light power intensity have a similar trend to spectral responsivity. The maximum values of detectivity measured under the illumination of 450 nm, 532 nm, and 638 nm lasers are , , and , respectively.

In addition to spectral responsivity (Rλ) and detectivity (D*), photoresponse speed is also an important parameter for evaluating the performance of a photodetector. The photoresponse speed of a photodetector to switching frequency determines its capability to follow a fast-varying optical signal.30Fig. 3e and f show the stability and sensitivity of the Sb2S3 NW photodetector. The photoresponse is measured by periodically switching ON/OFF the 638 nm laser with the light power intensity of 45.2 mW cm−2 at a bias voltage of 1 V. When the laser changes from the “OFF” state to the “ON” state, the current of the photodetector rapidly increased from a low value (about 2.0 × 10−10 A) to a relatively high saturation value (about 4.2 × 10−8 A), giving a high photoswitch ratio (Ilight/Idark) of 210. As shown in Fig. 3e, we also studied the stability of the photodetector by switching the laser periodically at a constant interval for multiple cycles. It can be seen that the current ON/OFF switching behavior was retained very well and was reversible. Besides, the rise and fall times are also measured, and the corresponding result is depicted in Fig. 3f. The rise time defined as the time needed to reach 90% of the maximum photocurrent, and the fall time defined as the time needed to drop to 10% of the maximum photocurrent, respectively. They are estimated to be about τr ∼ 37 ms and τf ∼ 38 ms, respectively. Meanwhile, the photoresponse properties of the photodetector under the illumination of 450 nm and 532 nm lasers are also investigated, and the results are shown in Fig. S4d, e, and S5d, e.† We have compared the photoresponse properties of the Sb2S3 NW based photodetector under the illumination of lasers with different wavelengths, and the detailed results can be seen in Table 1. From the comparison, we can know that the photoresponse capability of the photodetector has strong dependence on the illuminated laser wavelengths.
In order to illustrate the photoresponse of our Sb2S3 NW based photodetector to lights with different wavelengths, we observed the absorption spectrum of Sb2S3 NWs. As shown in Fig. 4a, Sb2S3 NWs have a strong wide absorption band from 200 to 790 nm. The maximum of absorption is at about 610 nm, and the absorption onset is at about 790 nm. So, it is understandable that Sb2S3 NW based photodetectors have more excellent photoresponse to a 638 nm laser than to 450 nm and 532 nm lasers. For Sb2S3, a quasi-direct bandgap material, the relationship between the absorption coefficient (α) and incident photon energy (hν) can be expressed by the function αhν = A(hν − Eg)2(4)where α is the absorption coefficient, h is Planck’ constant, ν is the light frequency, A is a constant and Eg is the optical band gap, respectively. According to Fig. 4b, the optical band gap of our prepared Sb2S3 NWs is about 1.57 eV. This result is in good agreement with our PL result. The electronic band structure of Sb2S3 was further studied using first-principles calculations. The calculation results are shown in Fig. 4c and d. The results reveal that the bulk Sb2S3 has a quasi-direct band gap. The CBM (conduction band minimum) is located at the Γ point and the VBM (valence band maximum) is located at the Γ′ point, which gives an indirect band gap of 1.28 eV. However, the second higher valence band valley located at the Γ point, which is 0.029 eV higher than that of the VBM located at the Γ′ point, results in a direct band gap of 1.309 eV (inset picture in Fig. 4c). As can be seen from the total DOS and partial density of states (PDOS) plots for bulk Sb2S3 shown in Fig. 4d, the CBM consists mainly of the Sb p state, whereas the VBM contains the S p state and the Sb s state. These band gap values are much smaller than the experimental optical band gaps; this underestimation of calculation of bandgaps is mainly due to the well-known limitation of the PBE method.

Exploring a photodetector which can be applied under both low temperature and high temperature conditions is critical for its practical application. In this paper, we investigated the optoelectronic properties of an Sb2S3 NW based photodetector at different temperatures (8 K–420 K). Fig. 5a shows the relationship between the conductance of the device and the temperature. As illustrated in the σ–T curve, the conductance strongly depends on the given temperature; it increases with increasing the temperature. It also can be seen that the curve can be split into three regions, 8–110 K (Fig. 5b), 110–320 K (Fig. 5c), and 320–420 K (Fig. 5d). In these three regions, the conductance shows three different temperature dependencies. Meanwhile, we also studied the performance of the device under the illumination of a 638 nm laser with a light power intensity of about 32 mW cm−2. As shown in Fig. 6a, Rλ and D* show strong temperature dependence. With the increase of temperature, Rλ and D* are increased in different degrees. For the temperature at 10 K, the Rλ and D* are measured as about 0.82 A W−1 and 1.6 × 1010 Jones, and for the temperature at 420 K, the Rλ and D* are measured as about 67.7 A W−1 and 1.7 × 1011 Jones. Temperature has an important influence on the current ON/OFF switching performance of the photodetector, and three obvious variation regions are also observed in Fig. 6b. The highest current ON/OFF ratio is 150, which is measured at a temperature of about 260 K. Fig. 6c and d show the photoresponse performance of this device at typical temperatures of 420 K and 8 K. It can be seen that they all work very well. Moreover, there is no obvious change in the photocurrent after multiple cycles, indicating the excellent stability and reproducibility of our photodetector. All these results indicate that our Sb2S3 NW photodetector has excellent performance at both low temperature and high temperature.

The photodetector performance was measured under the illumination of a 638 nm laser with a light intensity of 32 mW cm−2 and a bias voltage of 1 V. 
It is important to note that the temperature dependence of electrical conductivity and photoelectric performance of the Sb2S3 NW photodetector mainly originate from the complicated interactions between the carrier concentration and mobility. For a semiconductor, the relationship between its electrical conductivity and the carrier concentration and mobility can be expressed as σ = nqμn + pqμp(5)where σ is the electrical conductivity, n is the electron concentration, p is the hole concentration, q is the elementary charge, μn is the electron mobility, and μp is the hole mobility, respectively. So, the carrier mobility and concentration should be responsible for the electrical conductivity of a semiconductor. For a given semiconductor, the carrier concentration is only dependent on the temperature. But, the carrier mobility is determined by various scattering mechanisms. Among them, lattice scattering and ionized impurity scattering are two primary mechanisms; and at lower temperatures, ionized impurity scattering dominates, while lattice scattering dominates and ionized impurity scattering becomes less significant at higher temperatures. The influence of ionized impurity scattering and lattice scattering on the carrier mobility can be expressed as μi ∝ T3/2 and μs ∝ T−3/2, respectively. At the low temperature region (region I), there are only a few electrons in the conduction band, and almost all electrons are in the valence band. The electron concentration can be expressed as n ∝ T3/4exp(−ΔE/(2k0T))(6)where ΔE is the ionization energy and k0 is the Boltzmann constant. It can be observed that the carrier concentration increases exponentially with increasing temperature. The carrier mobility is mainly determined by ionization impurity scattering, which increases with increasing temperature. From Fig. 5b, the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity can be fitted as σ ∝ T0.5. So, for region I, in addition to the impurity, the complex electron–phonon interaction is also very important for carrier transport. As the temperature continues to increase (region II), appreciable numbers of electrons are thermally excited from the valence band to the conduction band. But, the growth of the carrier mobility which is determined by both lattice scattering and ionized impurity scattering has slowed down to some extent. As shown in Fig. 5c, the electrical conductivity is fitted by the expression: σ ∝ T3.43. We can observe that in region II, the effect of the carrier concentration on the electrical conductivity is greater than the carrier mobility. When the temperature increases to a higher temperature region (region III, Fig. 5d), the increase of the carrier concentration is mainly due to the ionization of the intrinsic carriers which can be expressed as: n ∝ T3/2exp(−Ea/(k0T))(7)where Ea is the activation energy. And the effect of the generation of carriers is far more than the decrease of the carrier mobility on the electrical conductivity. At this time, the carrier concentration becomes the primary contributor to the electrical conductivity, and as a result, the electrical conductivity increases sharply with increasing temperature. According to the experimental data, the σ–T curve can be fitted as: σ ∝ exp(0.02T). The temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity is an extremely complex process associated with the carrier concentration (impurity and intrinsic carrier concentration) and multiple scattering. This discussion just gives a qualitative explanation of the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity of the Sb2S3 NWs.
Conclusions
In summary, Sb2S3 NWs with high quality were prepared by a sulphur-assisted vapour transport method and the corresponding individual Sb2S3 NW based photodetectors were also fabricated. The photodetectors exhibit good photoresponse in a wide spectral range from about 300 nm to 800 nm. A high current ON/OFF ratio of about 210, a spectral responsivity of 1152 A W−1, a detectivity of 2 × 1013 Jones, and rise and fall times of less than 37 ms and 38 ms have been achieved under the illumination of a 638 nm laser at room temperature. These performances show remarkable enhancement compared to the previously published relevant work (Table 1). More importantly, the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity of Sb2S3 shows three variation regions. We think it results from the interaction between the carrier mobility and carrier concentration. Meanwhile, the fabricated photodetectors exhibit good adaptability to temperature, and they worked very well at a wide temperature range from 8 to 420 K. All the results indicate that Sb2S3 NWs prepared by a sulphur-assisted vapour transport method have enormous potential application in advanced optoelectronics devices.
Experimental
Synthesis of Sb2S3 nanowires
Sb2S3 nanowires were grown on an SiO2/Si substrate by a sulphur-assisted vapour transport method in a horizontal tube furnace. In a typical synthesis, 0.1 g Sb2S3 powder (99.99% purity) and pure sulphur were added to a ceramic boat as the source material. Sb2S3 powder was placed at the high temperature zone (the center of the furnace) and sulphur was placed at the low temperature zone (the inlet of the furnace). The substrates were placed at the low temperature zone. Argon (Ar) was selected as the carrier gas. Before heating, the Ar flows for 30 min to exhaust the air in the tube. The temperature rose from 30 to 550 °C at a rate of 30 °C min−1, and the temperature was kept at 550 °C for 2 min. Then the furnace was cooled down to room temperature under ambient conditions.
Measurement and characterization
The phase compositions, crystallographic structures and morphologies of the as-prepared materials were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Cu Kα irradiation, optical microscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM; JEM-2100F, JEOL) techniques. Raman and photoluminescence (PL) spectra were collected using a Renishaw inVia Reflex Raman Microscope and Spectrometer at an excitation line of 532 nm. The thickness of the Sb2S3 nanowires was identified by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Nanoscope IIIa). The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectrum of the Sb2S3 was measured using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV-2600) with a wavelength range of 200–900 nm.
Fabrication and characterization of photodetectors
Sb2S3 nanowire based photodetectors were fabricated on an SiO2/Si substrate (Si substrate with a 300 nm SiO2 insulating top layer) by conventional lithography and electron-beam deposition, and lift-off processes. The Au source and drain electrodes were deposited by electron beam evaporation. After removing the photoresist by using acetone, the photodetectors were annealed under an Ar atmosphere at 150 °C for 1 h to remove the resist residue and decrease the contact resistance. All photoelectric properties of the photodetectors were determined using a Transistor test system (Agilent-B2902). The photoresponse to continuous spectra from 200 to 1100 nm were collected using a light source with a 200 W xenon lamp. The 450, 532, and 638 nm lasers with adjustable light power intensity were selected to study the current–voltage and time–current characteristics of the photodetectors. The temperature-dependent electrical characterization was performed from 420 K to 8 K using a cold trap system.
Density functional theory calculation
The calculations are performed by using the projector augmented plane-wave (PAW) method within the framework of DFT using the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) functionals is adopted for electron exchange and correlation. The cutoff energy for the plane-wave basis set is set to 500 eV, and the first Brillouin zone is sampled using a (4 × 4 × 4) Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh for all calculations of bulk Sb2S3. The structure is fully relaxed with a force tolerance of 0.01 eV Å−1.
