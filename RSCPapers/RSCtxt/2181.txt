    , Accepted 24th August 2021First published on 25th August 2021AbstractThe race to decarbonize our energy systems has led to significant advancement in technologies for harvesting renewable energy, carbon capture and conversion. Future scenarios are being envisioned where CO2 is captured from air and converted to valuable fuels and chemicals, with methanol (MeOH) being the most coveted product. Here we assess transition pathways for the sustainable production of MeOH using CO2via direct air capture (DAC) and hybrid power via renewable photovoltaic (PV) and grid electricity. Specifically, we perform techno-economic and life-cycle analysis on technologically mature 1st generation (water electrolysis coupled to CO2 hydrogenation) and emerging 2nd generation air-to-MeOH (direct CO2-to-MeOH electrolysis) routes. Our results indicate that the two transition pathways would be economically compelling only in jurisdictions where low-cost ($0.02 per kWh) grid electricity is available. Furthermore, the economic feasibility of the 1st generation route will also depend on a drastic reduction in Si-PV ($300 per kW) and DAC ($280 per ton-CO2 per year) capital costs. On the other hand, the 2nd generation route will additionally need drastic performance improvement to be economically competitive, with required CO2 electrolysis current densities >300 mA cm−2, energy efficiency >50% and stack stability >2 years. The envisioned air-to-MeOH routes could lead to zero or negative CO2 emissions in jurisdictions with clean grid electricity (<50 kg-CO2 per MWh). We hope this study will garner key stakeholders to advance discussions about the cost and potential of this envisioned air-to-fuel technology.
1. Introduction
Fossil fuels have traditionally been our preferred energy source as they are cheap to extract, abundant, and have a high calorific value. They are responsible for the tremendous economic growth we have experienced in the last 50 years, but that has come at a cost. The use of fossil fuels has led to an increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.1,2 This has damaged the environment and led to climate change, with the last five years (2015–2019) recorded as the hottest ever on planet earth.3 In order to save our planet, we continue our transition towards renewable energy use and develop technologies for carbon capture, conversion, use, and storage.2 A clean and sustainable future can be envisioned as one where all these technologies will be working together for our energy needs and producing valuable fuels and chemicals.
Fortunately, the worldwide race on the development of low-cost and sustainable energy technologies has triggered significant progress over the last couple of decades. Solar photovoltaic (PV) power now represents the cheapest and most widely deployed renewable energy source with over 580 GW of cumulative installed capacity worldwide as of 2020.4 There are many PV technologies in the market based on Silicon, Cadmium Telluride (CdTe), Copper Indium Gallium Selenide (CIGS), as well as organic materials which are now competing with emerging technologies based on perovskites and other III–V semiconductors.5 Among these, silicon PV cells have been the dominant driving force with more than 90% of total PV market share and are expected to garner $163 billion by 2022, registering a compound annual growth rate  (CAGR) of 11.3% during a forecast period of 2016–2022.6 A key reason behind this has been in the improvement of efficiency with currently reported silicon cell efficiency exceeding 25% and module efficiency over 20%.7 The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) from silicon PV now competes with fossil fuels and in many jurisdictions, available at less than 5 cents per kWh.8 This has spurred the research, development, and commercialization of electrochemical technologies, including water electrolysis,9 and CO2 electrolysis.10 We have witnessed tremendous progress in the field of electrochemical CO2 reduction to high-value fuels and chemicals such as CO,10 C2H4,11 HCOOH,12 which can now be produced at high current densities (>1 A cm−2) and faradaic efficiencies (>90%).
On the other hand, there has been significant advancement in direct air capture (DAC) technology. DAC is technically and economically challenging as the concentration of CO2 in the air is quite low (∼400 ppm).13 Several research groups around the world are developing energy-efficient DAC technology14 with a focus on materials and process optimization.15 Carbon Engineering16 and Climeworks17 are two of the few companies (Table S1, ESI†) pursuing DAC technology, with their pilot-scale DAC plants running since 2015 and 2017 respectively, with a capacity to extract ∼1–3 ton CO2 per day. In this regard, an economic study on Carbon Engineering's pilot-plant estimated the cost of CO2 capture between $94 and $232 per ton-CO2.16 On the other hand, Climeworks reported a capture cost of $600 per ton-CO2 at its Swiss plant and expected to bring costs down to as low as $100 per ton-CO2.18
While these emerging technologies for harvesting solar energy, capturing, and converting CO2 have received attention, a comprehensive system-level analysis of a process that combines these emerging technologies to produce value added chemicals, such as methanol (MeOH) is yet to be reported. MeOH production is particularly attractive due to its large market size (37 billion USD in 2020), ease of storage, transportation, and its versatility to be converted into olefins or use as a fuel.19 The previously reported techno-economic and life cycle analysis on CO2-to-MeOH routes are summarized in Table S2, ESI.† In this regard, we present a comprehensive assessment of a process that captures energy from sunlight and CO2 from the air to convert it into MeOH in what can be called an “Air-to-MeOH” process. We have also provided technological targets that need to be achieved at scale to make such an envisioned pathway viable in future markets.
In this study, we use an aqueous solution-based DAC system to provide CO2, while two different routes for MeOH synthesis are considered based on their relative technology readiness level (TRL). The 1st generation air-to-MeOH pathway integrates a H2O electrolyzer and CO2 hydrogenation reactor, while the 2nd generation involves direct CO2 electrolysis process. Our TEA results indicate that the economic feasibility of both routes is significantly influenced by the performance and capital costs of different technologies that is Si-PV, DAC, and H2O electrolysis. In the current market scenario none of the envisioned air-to-MeOH routes are economically viable with high levelized cost of MeOH (LCM) of ∼1180$ per ton and ∼1730$ per ton for 1st and 2nd generation routes, respectively. However, the 1st generation air-to-MeOH route would likely be economically compelling in near future due to the expected decrease in capital costs of Si-PV and DAC from economy of scale. In contrast, the 2nd generation MeOH route would not only require a reduction in capital costs but also require significant improvement in technology development, with required CO2 electrolyzer current densities >300 mA cm−2, energy efficiency >50% and stack stability >2 years. Furthermore, our life cycle analysis (LCA) indicates that a grid carbon emissions intensity of <220 kg-CO2 per MWh and <140 kg-CO2 per MWh is needed for 1st and 2nd generation pathways, respectively, for net CO2 emissions to be within the range of incumbent MeOH synthesis route. In countries like Sweden and Iceland with a relatively clean electricity grid (<50 kg-CO2 per MWh), the envisioned air-to-MeOH routes could even lead to zero or negative CO2 emissions.
2. Process design
In the proposed pathways, about 1100 metric tons per day (tpd) of MeOH is produced using CO2 as feedstock, based on the typical capacity of a MeOH plant of 550–5000 tpd.20 The CO2 feed is received from the DAC unit, while the required electric power is generated in a hybrid fashion whereby a Si-PV solar farm provides electricity during the day and grid electricity is utilized at night. This approach allows for avoiding expensive renewable electricity storage options such as batteries or compressed H2. We considered two pathways for air-to-MeOH conversion in this study based on their relative TRL (Fig. 1). In the first pathway (i.e., 1st generation), the H2O electrolyzer and CO2 hydrogenation reactor have a TRL of 7–9 as they are widely available for commercial application.21,22 A pilot plant of this route was recently built by pan-European mefCO2 project on June 2019 with the expected MeOH production capacity of 1 tpd,23 while some others are under constructions (Table S3, ESI†). In the second pathway, a direct CO2-to-MeOH electrolyzer (i.e., 2nd generation) is used which exhibits a TRL of 1–3 given its operation is still in the laboratory-scale.10 A schematic of the proposed pathways is shown in Fig. 1, with key process parameters presented in Table S4 of ESI.†
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the two air-to-MeOH routes assessed in this study. (Top) Technologically mature 1st generation route comprises of two reactors: H2O electrolyzer and CO2 hydrogenation reactor. (Bottom) Futuristic 2nd generation route only requires single CO2 electrolyzer. 
2.1. 1st generation: two-step air-to-MeOH pathway
In the 1st generation route, a DAC unit captures and concentrates CO2 from the air which is fed to the CO2 hydrogenation. The required H2 for hydrogenation reactions is supplied by H2O electrolyzer via reaction (R1).9 H2O → H2 + 0.5O2 Veq = 1.229 V(R1)
The hydrogenation reaction for MeOH production is facilitated by reaction (R2)–(R4).24 CO2 + 3H2 → CH3OH + H2O ΔH298 = −131 kJ mol−1(R2) CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O ΔH298 = +41 kJ mol−1(R3) CO (recycled) + 2H2 → CH3OH ΔH298 = −91 kJ mol−1(R4)
The gaseous products (i.e., CO and unconverted H2) are recycled to the hydrogenation reaction, while the liquid products are sent to the distillation unit for purification to reach 99 wt% MeOH.
2.2. 2nd generation: single-step air-to-MeOH pathway
The source of CO2 and electricity is the same as in 1st generation pathway, but the CO2 is directly fed to a CO2-to-MeOH electrolyzer, to facilitate the electrochemical reaction (R5).25 CO2 + 2H2O → CH3OH + 1.5O2 Veq = 1.199 V(R5)
In the CO2 electrolyzer, O2 produced at the anode is sent to the three-stage compression unit to achieve market specifications (200 bar). The cathodic products (MeOH and H2) are sent to the gas–liquid separation unit to separate the gaseous (unconverted CO2 and H2) and liquid (electrolyte and MeOH) components. The gaseous components are then directed to the pressure swing adsorption (PSA) unit to remove CO2 from H2 which is then recycled back to the CO2 electrolyzer, while the H2 is compressed and stored. The electrolyte properties are adapted from literature,26 which considers water as the main component of the electrolyte and we assume that the concentration of MeOH has an insignificant effect on the electrolyzer performance. Therefore, the liquid product of the CO2 electrolyzer can be continuously recirculated so that a higher concentration (up to 60 wt%) of MeOH is obtained prior to entering the distillation unit. The distillation unit produces high purity MeOH (99 wt%) and the electrolyte is recycled to the CO2 electrolyzer.
A Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyzer was used to facilitate H2O electrolysis in 1st generation due to its high efficiency, high current density and high-pressure operation.27 An alkaline electrolyzer was selected to facilitate CO2 electrolysis in 2nd generation.26,28 Aspen Plus is used to model the hydrogenation reactions, gas–liquid separation, compression, and distillation. The capital and operating costs of the Aspen Plus simulated processes are estimated using Aspen Process Economic Analyzer. Further details regarding the process simulation are provided in section 3 of the ESI.† The financial parameters which are constant throughout the analysis are summarized in Table 1. The techno-economic parameters used in base (current) and optimistic (futuristic) scenarios are summarized in Table 2.

The plant is assumed to be erected in an area with high direct normal irradiance (>7 kW h m−2 day−1) with average daylight of 6 hours such as those available in the United States of America39,40 and Saudi Arabia.41,42 Based on the Department of Energy (DOE) technical report 2020, the stack cost of the PEM H2O electrolyzer in the base scenario is assumed to be $342 per kW ($12996 per m2), which declines to $143 per kW ($7722 per m2) in the optimistic scenario (year 2030).27 The stack cost of the alkaline CO2 electrolyzer is assumed to be $130 per kW ($437 per m2) which drops to $80 per kW ($267 per m2) in the optimistic scenario, due to the improvements in performance and economy of scale (please refer to section 5A of ESI†).43 Based on the literature reports, we assumed CO2 electrolyzer is operated at a single-pass conversion efficiency of 50% for both the base and optimistic scenarios.44 The stack replacement schedule is shown in Table 2, at a cost of ∼15% of the total uninstalled capital cost for PEM electrolyzer27 and ∼50% of the stack cost for alkaline electrolyzer.45 The cost of the Si-PV module and single-axis tracker in the base scenario is $600 per kW based on current module efficiency of 19%.50 In the optimistic scenario the Si-PV capital cost decreases to $300 per kW due to the increase of installed capacity and the improvement of supply chain.46,47 The design and costs of the DAC unit were adopted from an industrially reported process by Carbon Engineering, wherein the DAC operates using an aqueous KOH sorbent coupled to a calcium caustic recovery loop.16 The DAC operates using two connected chemical loops where the first loop captures CO2 from atmosphere using the aqueous KOH solution and second loop is used to recover KOH using Ca(OH)2. The Ca(OH)2 itself is recovered using calcination and hydration steps. A capital cost of $694 per ton CO2 per year is adapted for a scenario with minimum gas input that has no gas turbine and uses grid electricity to make up all power not supplied by the steam cycle running off the steam slaker.16 In the optimistic scenario, we assumed a 75% cost reduction due to the increase of cumulative installed capacity by the year 2030.48 A natural gas price of $6 per GJ is selected in the base scenario, dropping to $4 per GJ in the optimistic scenario. A current grid electricity price of $0.05 per kWh is used in the base scenario and considering the rapid drop in the cost of renewable electricity, the electricity price in the optimistic scenario is expected to decrease to $0.03 per kWh.8 In this study, the selling price of O2 and H2 was also varied according to the market situation as listed in Table 2.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Economic analysis

Fig. 2a shows the calculated levelized cost of MeOH (LCM). Under the base scenario, the LCM is ∼1180$ per ton and ∼1730$ per ton for 1st and 2nd generation routes, respectively, which is much higher than the current market price of MeOH ranging between 300 to 500$ per ton.55 The low market price of MeOH is due to the mature hydrogenation technology used which converts syngas (CO and H2) into MeOH at high temperature (∼523.15 K) and high pressure (50–100 bar).56 For 1st generation air-to-MeOH routes, the operating costs are the dominant (∼60%) contributor followed by capital costs (∼40%), while for 2nd generation the operating costs and capital costs contribute equally, but these costs are much higher for 2nd generation as compared to the 1st generation leading to higher LCM. This is due to the mature technologies used in 1st generation route, such as the H2O electrolyzer and hydrogenation reactor which operate at high current densities and energy efficiencies, respectively. On the other hand, in 2nd generation route we used a direct CO2-to-MeOH electrolyzer, which is still operated on a laboratory scale at moderate current densities and energy efficiency. This results in a larger electrolyzer area, Si-PV solar farm area, and electricity requirement, thereby resulting in higher capital and operating costs. Under the optimistic scenario, the LCM drops drastically for both to ∼470$ per ton and ∼520$ per ton for 1st and 2nd generation routes, respectively. In such a scenario, the LCM of both routes (single-step and two-step) is close to the current market price of MeOH. The synergetic effect between the decrease of equipment cost and the improvement in electrochemical performance results in the decrease of capital and operating costs as shown in Fig. 2b and c, respectively.
 Fig. 2  Breakdown of the (a) levelized cost of methanol (LCM), (b) the capital cost, and (c) the annual operating cost for air-to-MeOH routes in the base and optimistic scenarios. The area between black dashed vertical lines in (a) indicate the current market price range of MeOH. The gray dashed line differentiates 1st generation and 2nd generation air-to-MeOH pathways. The “other” portion in (b) refers to the capital cost associated with land, working capital, contingency, and equipment for separation and compression. The “other” portion in (c) is summation of labor, compression, and separation costs. 
While capital cost of Si-PV is the dominant contributor to total capital costs, the grid electricity cost is a dominant contributor to annual operating costs. This expected finding can be attributed to the high electricity consumption for MeOH production (1st Gen: 10.5 MW he per ton; 2nd Gen: 18.1 kW he per ton) which also dictates both the size and cost of the Si-PV farm. In the optimistic scenario, improvements in catalyst performance reduce the electricity to 10.0 kW he per kg-MeOH and 12.7 kW he per kg-MeOH for 1st and 2nd generation routes, respectively. The combination of the reduced energy requirement along with a decrease in capital costs, electricity price, and natural gas prices suppress the total capital and operating costs in optimistic scenario. As summarized in Table 2, we forecast significant improvements in the performance of the direct CO2-to-MeOH electrolyzer versus the more mature H2O electrolyzer. This leads to a drastic decrease in capital and operating costs for 2nd generation which results in similar LCM for both routes in the optimistic scenario. We observed that the economic feasibility of air-to-MeOH routes is influenced by multiple economic and technical parameters. In the proceeding section, we carried out a detailed sensitivity analysis to understand the key drivers of air-to-MeOH route.
3.2. Sensitivity analysis
A sensitivity analysis was carried out by varying different process parameters, as shown in Fig. 3 and tabulated in Table 3 while keeping the remaining parameters constant at the base scenario. Fig. 3a and b suggest that the LCM is very sensitive to the grid electricity price for both routes. As discussed earlier, given the significant energy requirement for the air-to-MeOH process (10.5–18.1 kW he per kg MeOH), and the fact that grid provides power to all the units i.e., DAC, electrolyzer, PSA, and distillation unit makes it important to have cheap grid electricity. The grid electricity as less as $0.02 per kWh drops the LCM from $1180 per ton to $945 per ton and $1730 per ton to $1340 per ton in 1st generation and 2nd generation, respectively. The huge electricity requirement for the air-to-MeOH process is also the reason for the significant influence of capital cost of Si-PV on the LCM. Similarly, the capital cost of DAC also has a substantial influence on the LCM as CO2 is the main feedstock for MeOH production.

An interesting observation for 1st generation pathway (Fig. 3a) is that only the parameters associated with power generation (grid and Si-PV) and CO2 capture (DAC) exhibit significant influence on the LCM, while the performance of electrolyzers has minor effect on the LCM. This is due to the maturity of the H2O electrolysis technology used in 1st generation, whereby the different units operate at high performance and a variation within the range taken in this analysis does not affect the LCM. In contrast, in the single-step MeOH route of 2nd generation (Fig. 3b), the energy efficiency (EE) of CO2 electrolysis has a significant influence on the LCM. From the market aspect, only the O2 selling price has a moderate influence on the LCM, while the selling price of H2 and the natural gas price has a minor effect. This can be attributed to the significant amount of O2 production, while the H2 production and natural gas consumption are much lower.
To this end, we sought to reveal the capital cost target for the DAC and Si-PV when remaining parameters are available in the optimistic scenario. Fig. 4 shows the LCM in 1st and 2nd generation under optimistic scenario. This analysis reveals that significant cost reduction is required both for the DAC and Si-PV for the envisioned air-to-MeOH pathways to be cost competitive in future markets. Considering the high TRL of the processes involved in 1st generation pathway, cost competitiveness of the produced MeOH would be highly dependent on the capital cost reduction of DAC, Si-PV as well as water electrolyzer stack. To put these results into perspective, considering a 73% energy efficiency of industrially mature PEM water electrolyzer, the DAC and Si-PV cost need to be $280 per ton-CO2 per year) and $300 per kW when grid electricity will be available at $0.02 per kW per h and natural gas at <$4 per GJ. On the other hand, for 2nd generation pathway, apart from capital cost reduction, the performance improvement of the CO2 electrolyzer would be vital. Fig. 5 summarizes the effect of energy efficiency and current density of the CO2 electrolyzer on the LCM in 2nd generation pathway with our optimistic cost assumptions. While the energy efficiency of the CO2 electrolyzer has drastic impact on the LCM, the improvement in current density is important up to a certain threshold (300 mA cm−2). Under these assumptions, to achieve cost parity ($500 per ton MeOH) the energy efficiency of the CO2 electrolyzer needs to reach 50% at a current density of 300 mA cm−2. Unfortunately, to date, the electrochemical CO2 reduction to MeOH remains at its infancy (≲30%) and distant from commercialization.28

3.3. Carbon footprint of air-to-methanol pathways
To this end, we conducted a cradle-to-gate life cycle analysis (LCA) on the proposed 1st and 2nd generation air-to-MeOH routes for the base scenario. Among various greenhouse gases (CO2, CO, CH4, NOx and SOx), we focused on evaluating CO2 emissions due to the dominance of CO2 concentration in the flue gas.57 In this analysis, we focus on the primary energy requirement including electricity production, natural gas extraction (4 kg-CO2 per GJ58) and natural gas combustion (50 kg-CO2 per GJ59). We did not include any emissions associated with construction and decommissioning and water treatment in the analysis, as these contributions are minimal as compared to the operating phase of the plant.60 The emissions from natural gas transportation,58 electricity transmission and distribution61 are also negligible and not included in the analysis. We assumed an emissions intensity of electricity from Si-PV as 40 kg-CO2 per MWh, based on literature reports.62 The LCA analysis revealed that the cradle-to-gate CO2 emissions of proposed route heavily depend on emissions intensity of the grid as shown in Fig. 6. For example, considering present-day emission intensity of grid electricity in U.S. (453 kg-CO2 per MWh (Table S7†)), we estimated net CO2 emissions of ∼2.56 kg-CO2 per kg MeOH for 1st generation, ∼4.42 kg-CO2 per kg MeOH for 2nd generation air-to-MeOH pathways. The higher process efficiency of 1st generation route (37%) as compared to the one in 2nd generation (26%) resulted in lower CO2 emissions in the former case. These calculated emissions are two to four times higher than that of the incumbent MeOH synthesis route using natural gas (0.68–1.08 kg CO2e per kg MeOH).63 The LCA analysis also helped set targets for electricity emissions intensity, where we observe that an emissions intensity of <220 kg-CO2 per MW per h and <140 kg-CO2 per MW per h is needed for 1st and 2nd generation pathways, respectively, for net CO2 emissions to be within the range of incumbent MeOH synthesis route. In the current scenario, countries with low carbon electricity such as those in European union (EU) and Canada would be more suitable for the proposed air-to-MeOH technology, while such low carbon electricity is projected for the U.S. grid mix by the year 205064. The net CO2 emissions if we can achieve significant reductions in grid carbon intensity or improve technology such as that presented in optimistic scenario of Table 2 is presented in Fig. S4 in the ESI.†
 Fig. 6  The net CO2 emissions from air-to-MeOH production pathways under the base scenario. The blue dashed lines are representative of average electricity emission intensity in various jurisdictions (see Table S7†). The brown dashed lines indicate the range of CO2 emissions from conventional MeOH synthesis route.63 
The proposed air-to-MeOH routes could lead to zero or net negative CO2 emissions if one could run the process with renewable electricity with emissions intensity below 50 kg-CO2 per MWh. In this regard, one could consider the example of Iceland where 100% renewable electricity on grid emits only ∼8 kg-CO2 per MWh.65 In such a scenario, net negative CO2 emissions can be obtained for both 1st generation (−0.36 kg-CO2 per MeOH) and 2nd generation (−0.38 kg-CO2 per MeOH). Beside Iceland, some Canadian jurisdictions (Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia) and Sweden with an average electricity emissions intensity below ∼50 kg-CO2 per MW per h will also result in net negative CO2 emissions.66 The CO2 emission intensity when other types of renewable electricity (wind, geothermal, and hydro) substitute Si-PV electricity is presented in Fig. S5.†
4. Conclusion and perspective
We are under immense pressure to quickly adapt renewable energy sources, develop technologies for energy storage, carbon capture, conversion, and use. A clean and sustainable future can be envisioned as one where all these technologies are working together for our energy needs to produce valuable fuels and chemicals. The importance of MeOH in this context cannot be overstated. Because of its high energy density, ease of storage and transportation, it can potentially act as an excellent energy vector. In this study, we have presented a comprehensive TEA and cradle-to-gate LCA of current scenario where different emerging technologies for harvesting renewable energy (Si-PV), carbon capture (DAC), carbon conversion (CO2 electrolysis or CO2 hydrogenation) work hand-in-hand for producing renewable methanol (valuable chemical and energy storage solution) from air with net-negative CO2 emissions. Based on their TRL, we present two different air-to-MeOH routes: i.e., via integration of H2O electrolysis and CO2 hydrogenation reactor (1st generation), and via direct CO2 electrolysis (2nd generation) as near future and long-term possibilities, respectively. Our results indicate that in current scenario, the envisioned air-to-MeOH routes are not compelling with high levelized costs and CO2 emissions.
At the same time, our analysis also revealed that the 1st generation route could possibly be feasible for renewable MeOH production in near future when certain techno-economic conditions fall into place. It will require Si-PV capital cost of below $300 per kW, DAC capital cost (<$280 per ton-CO2 per year), water electrolyzer stack capital cost of <$143 per kW with current density over 2.5 A cm−2, grid electricity price (<2 cents per kWh), and electricity emissions intensity (220 kg-CO2 per MWh) to get levelized costs and related CO2 emissions to compete with incumbent MeOH production pathway. A Si-PV industry experienced a massive price drop of more than 80% coming from subsidized industries that could sell products with little to no profit. Similar cost reductions can be expected with DAC, where a capital cost below $280 per ton-CO2 per year (results in CO2 cost of ∼120 per ton-CO2) is required to reap economic benefits. These numbers have already been proven on a smaller pilot scale such as the one by Carbon Engineering who estimated the cost of CO2 capture between $94 per ton-CO2 and $232 per ton-CO2.16 The DAC capital cost is predicted to plummet to ∼$140 per ton-CO2 per year) in 2040 as the installed cumulative capacity reach ∼5000 Mton-CO2 per year.54 This capacity would require autonomous and mass production manufacturing process. From the performance point of view, increasing DAC performance is much more challenging as the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is small (∼400 ppm). Last but not the least, the CO2 emissions from the proposed air-to-MeOH routes will decrease as the share of renewable electricity on the grid increases across the world.
On the other hand, direct CO2 electrolysis route (2nd generation) is an attractive technology but will need drastic improvements in technology to be economically competitive, with required current densities >300 mA cm−2, EE > 50% and considerable improvements in catalyst stability (>2 years). Considering the rapid development of electrochemical technologies, in an optimistic scenario this route would likely be compelling in the future. The emergence of artificial intelligence and machine learning would accelerate the development of catalysts and electrolyzer design. To conclude, our results indicate the envisioned air-to-MeOH routes could lead to low or net-zero CO2 emissions in jurisdictions where low-carbon electricity is available, however the economic viability and therefore commercial success will depend on both advancement of technology and economy of scale. Most importantly, adoption of clean and sustainable technologies as proposed in this study will need productive discussions among key stakeholders and enforcement of policies such as carbon pricing to accelerate the transition.
