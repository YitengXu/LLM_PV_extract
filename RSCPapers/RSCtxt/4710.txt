    , Accepted 22nd April 2018First published on 23rd April 2018AbstractSolution-processable graphene derivatives, such as graphene oxide (GO) and graphene quantum dots (GQDs), are a promising class of cathode interlayer (CIL) materials for polymer solar cells (PSCs). These graphene derivatives always contain ions, which may migrate under electrical field during the PSC device operation and consequently deteriorate device stability. In this manuscript, by functionalizing GQDs with amino N-oxide groups at the edge of the graphene basal plane, we develop a non-ionic graphene derivative (GQD-NO) as a CIL. The periphery polar amino N-oxide groups form the desired interfacial dipole with an indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode to lower the work function by as much as 1.06 eV. As a result, GQD-NO as a CIL forms Ohmic contact with the active layer of PSC devices, improves electron transport/extraction, blocks holes and prevents charge recombination on the cathode. Owing to the periphery amino N-oxide groups, GQD-NO exhibits good solubility in water and insolubility in common low-polarity organic solvents, which enables multilayer inverted PSC device fabrication. In addition, the small lateral size of GQD-NO leads to a large bandgap and transparency in the visible/NIR region. Using a blend of poly[N-9-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4,7-di-thienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT) and [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the active layer, the inverted PSC device with GQD-NO as CIL shows the power conversion efficiency of 7.43%, which is much higher than that with the state-of-the-art ZnO as CIL (PCE = 6.56%) or without the CIL (PCE = 3.16%). These results indicate that non-ionic GQD-NO is a promising CIL for PSCs.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted enormous attention because of their advantages of mechanical flexibility, light-weight and low-cost with solution processing.1–6 The interfaces between the anode/cathode and active layer of PSCs play an important role in photovoltaic performance.7,8 Therefore, great efforts have been made to develop cathode interlayers (CILs) and anode interlayers to construct high-performance PSCs. CILs should not only decrease the cathode work funtion to form Ohmic contact with the active layer for electron transport/extraction but also block holes to prevent charge recombination on the cathode.9,10 Moreover, ideal CILs should be transparent in the visible/near infrared region (NIR) to maximize solar light absorption by the active layer and should be solution processable. Typical CIL materials include low work function metals (e.g. Ca),11 inorganic salts (e.g. LiF, Cs2CO3),12,13 inorganic semiconducting oxides (e.g. TiO2, ZnO)14–18 and organic molecules/polymers (e.g. PFN, PEIE, PDINO).19–21 A promising class of CIL materials is solution-processable graphene derivatives, such as graphene oxide (GO) and graphene quantum dots (GQDs).22–27 The chemical structures of the graphene derivatives can be modified and their properties can be tuned to meet the multiple requirements of CILs to give excellent PSC device performance.
GO and GQDs themselves exhibit high work functions and can be used as AILs in PSCs.23,24 To develop CIL materials with low work functions, a general strategy is to modify GO or GQDs with ions, such as alkali metal ions and tetraalkylammonium.24–26 For example, Dai et al. and Liu et al. reported cesium-neutralized GO and cesium-neutralized GQDs as CILs, respectively.24,25 Liu et al. modified GQDs with tetraammonium iodide groups to develop CILs with excellent PSC device performance.27 However, the ions of these solution processable graphene derivatives may migrate in the electric field during the PSC device operation, which deteriorates device efficiency and stability.28,29 Therefore, it is important and challenging to develop non-ionic solution processable graphene derivatives as CILs for PSCs.
In this manuscript, we functionalized GQDs with amino N-oxide groups at the edge of the graphene basal plane to develop non-ionic graphene derivatives as CILs. Fig. 1 shows the schematic illustration of the chemical structure of the novel CIL material, GQD-NO. The periphery amino N-oxide groups with large dipoles can form the desired interfacial dipole with an indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode to greatly lower the electrode work function. The periphery amino N-oxide groups also endow GQD-NO with good solubility in water and efficient solution processing. In addition, the small lateral size of GQD-NO leads to a large bandgap and transparency in the visible/NIR region.30 Using a blend of poly[N-9-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4,7-di-thienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT) and [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the active layer (Fig. 1), the inverted PSC device with GQD-NO as CIL shows a power conversion efficiency of 7.43%, which is much higher than that with ZnO as CIL (PCE = 6.56%) or without a CIL (PCE = 3.16%). These results indicate that GQD-NO is a promising CIL for PSCs. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first non-ionic graphene derivative as a CIL for organic photovoltaics.

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic route to GQD-NO is shown in Fig. 2a. GQDs were synthesized by chemical oxidation of carbon black with HNO3/H2SO4 following our previous procedures.31 GQDs have a high content of carboxylic acid groups at the edge and negligible content of epoxy/hydroxy groups on the graphene basal plane. Amidation of the pheriphery carboxylic groups of the GQDs with 3-(dimethylamino)-1-propylamine (DAPA) afforded GQD-N. Finally, GQD-N was oxidized by hydrogen peroxide to give GQD-NO. GQD-NO exhibits excellent solubility in de-ionized water (>20 mg mL−1) and some polar organic solvents, such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). Moreover, GQD-NO is insoluble in low-polarity organic solvents, such as toluene, chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene.

The chemical structure of GQD-NO was confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS). The AFM height image (Fig. 2b) of GQD-NO displays a thickness of ca. 0.5 nm, indicating a single-layered graphene structure. The TEM image (Fig. 2c) suggests that GQD-NO has a uniform lateral size of ca. 3 nm. As will be seen later, the small lateral size is important for the solubility of GQD-NO and for the optical transparency with a large optical bandgap. According to the XPS survey spectra (Fig. 2d, Fig. S1 and Table S1, ESI†), the content of nitrogen in GQD-NO is ca. 8 at%. The band at 285.8 eV in the XPS C 1s spectra of GQD-NO confirms the presence of nitrogen. The absence of the band at 288.8 eV (attributed to COOH groups) and the presence of the band at 287.0 eV (attributed to amide groups) in the XPS C 1s spectra of GQD-NO indicate the complete amidation of the periphery COOH groups of GQDs. In the N 1s spectrum of GQD-NO (Fig. 2e), the band at 403.2 eV is attributed to N+–O− groups, indicating the oxidation of the terminal dimethylamine group of GQD-N.32,33 These results suggest that GQD-NO contains amino N-oxide groups at the edge of the graphene basal plane.
2.2 Properties

Fig. 3a shows the UV/vis absorption spectrum of GQD-NO in de-ionized water. GQD-NO exhibits an absorption peak at 230 nm attributed to the π–π* transition of aromatic sp2 carbon.34 Most importantly, GQD-NO shows negligible absorbance in the visible/NIR range. The high transparency of GQD-NO in the visible/NIR range is very desirable for its application as a CIL in PSCs because it can maximize the solar light absorption by the active layer.

AFM was employed to study the film-forming capability of GQD-NO on ITO substrates. As shown in Fig. 4, the bare ITO substrate exhibits a root-mean-square (rms) roughness of 4.43 nm. After spin-coating of a GQD-NO layer with the aqueous solution, the ITO surface becomes smoother with the rms roughness decreasing to 2.13 nm. This result indicates the good film-forming property of GQD-NO on the ITO electrode. The resistance of a CIL to organic solvent is necessary for the orthogonal solution processing of multilayer devices of PSCs. We investigated the solvent resistance of GQD-NO by measuring the absorbance of GQD-NO film before and after rinsing with dichlorobenzene. As shown in Fig. 3b, the rinsing with dichlorobenzene barely affects the absorbance of the GQD-NO film, indicating that GQD-NO is resistant to dichlorobenzene. Therefore, GQD-NO can be used to fabricate multilayer PSC devices with orthogonal solvent processing.

Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was used to study the effect of the GQD-NO film on the work function of the ITO electrode. Fig. 5a shows the secondary electron cutoff region (Ecut-off) in the UPS spectra of the ITO electrode with and without modification with the GQD-NO layer. The work function was estimated with the equation of φ = hv − Ecut-off + Efermi, where hv (21.2 eV) is the incoming photon energy from the He source.35 The bare ITO electrode exhibits a work fucntion of 4.70 eV. Upon deposition of a thin layer of GQD-NO (∼6 nm, Fig. S4, ESI†), the work function decreases dramatically to 3.64 eV. The large decrease of work function is due to the formation of the dipole of the amino N-oxide groups at the electrode interface, which has already been reported for organic/polymer CIL materials with amino N-oxide groups. In PSCs, with the decreased work function, the ITO cathode can form Ohmic contact with the photoactive material in PSC devices to facilitate electron transport and collection. Moreover, the low cathode work function would result in a large built-in potential across the active layer, which would benefit the device performance.

2.3 Device performance
To evaluate the performance of GQD-NO as a CIL, we fabricated the inverted PSCs with the configuration of ITO/GQD-NO/PCDTBT:PC71BM/MoO3/Al (Fig. 1). For comparison, we also fabricated the control devices without CIL or with ZnO as CIL. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices under AM1.5G illumination are presented in Fig. 6a and the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are shown in Fig. 6b. The characteristics of the PSC devices are listed in Table 1. The PSC device with the bare ITO cathode exhibits the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.57 V, short-circuit current density (JSC) of 10.57 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 0.525, corresponding to a PCE of 3.16%. With GQD-NO as CIL, the PSC device shows a VOC of 0.90 V, JSC of 11.48 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.719, leading to a PCE of 7.43%. This performance is even better than that with ZnO as CIL, which shows a PCE of 6.51%. The increased JSC and PCE of the GQD-NO based PSC device may originate from the decreased work function of the cathode, which leads to Ohmic contact with the active layer and results in increased built-in electrical field across the device. Moreover, the JSC of the above-mentioned PSC devices matches well with the JSC values obtained via integration of the corresponding EQE spectra.

To understand the excellent device performance of GQD-NO as CIL, we measured the J–V curves of PSC devices in the dark. As shown in Fig. 7, the device with GQD-NO as CIL exhibits much lower leakage current density than those of the devices without a CIL or with ZnO as CIL. This suggests that GQD-NO possesses good hole-blocking capability and improves charge selectivity at the cathode interface, which is consistent with the improved VOC and FF. We also estimated the electron mobilities of the electron-only PSC devices with different interlayers on the ITO electrode using a space-charge limit current (SCLC) method. The device structure is ITO/CILs/PCDTBT:PC71BM/Ca/Al. The J–V curves of the electron-only devices are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The electron mobilities are obtained by fitting the data using the space charge-limited current (SCLC) model.36 The electron mobilities for the devices with none, ZnO, and GQD-NO CILs are 6.93 × 10−5, 1.23 × 10−4 and 2.88 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The high electron mobility of the device with GQD-NO indicates that the GQD-NO layer facilitates electron transport from the active layer to the ITO electrode. In addition, we have studied the charge-transfer state (CTS) dissociation efficiency of the PSC devices to investigate the charge recombination, according to the literature.37 As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), the CTS dissociation efficiency of the PSC device without a cathode interlayer is 72.8%, which indicates inefficient exciton dissociation or charge transfer at the cathode interface. The CTS dissociation efficiency of the device with GQD-NO as CIL (93.8%) is very comparable to that with the state-of-the-art CIL, ZnO (91.6), illustrating that the GQD-NO CIL may effectively prevent charge recombination at the cathode interface.

3. Conclusions
In summary, we developed a non-ionic graphene derivative as CIL by functionalizing GQDs with amino N-oxide groups at the edge of the graphene basal plane. The periphery polar amino N-oxide groups of GQD-NO form the desired interfacial dipole with the ITO electrode to lower the work function by as much as 1.06 eV. GQD-NO exhibits good solubility in water and insolubility in common low-polarity organic solvents owing to the periphery amino N-oxide groups. GQD-NO also shows a large bandgap and high transparency in the visible/NIR region. The inverted PSC device based on the PCDTBT:PC71BM active layer with GQD-NO as CIL shows a PCE of 7.43%, which is much higher than that with the state-of-the-art ZnO as CIL (PCE = 6.56%) or without a CIL (PCE = 3.16%). These results indicate that non-ionic GQD-NO is an excellent CIL material for PSCs.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Synthesis of GQD-NO
Firstly, GQDs were synthesized as described in our previous report.31 Briefly, a mixture of carbon black (2 g, Vulcan XC-72 carbon black, Cabot Corporation), concentrated H2SO4 (80 mL) and HNO3 (40 mL) was stirred at 130 °C for 36 hours. The mixture was cooled down and diluted with de-ionized water followed by neutralizing with NaOH. The resulting mixture was poured into acetone and the precipitated salt crystals were removed by filtration. The residual solution was removed by rotary evaporation to give the GQDs. A mixture of GQDs (400 mg), 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (800 mg, EDC·HCl), N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (400 mg, NHS) and de-ionized water (200 mL) was stirred for 40 minutes. Then DAPA (200 μL) was added into the mixture with vigorous stirring at room temperature for 24 hours. The mixture was extracted with dichloromethane and the retained aqueous phase was rotary evaporated to give a solid. The solid was dispersed in methanol with vigorous stirring and then the precipitates were removed by filtration. The filtrate was rotary evaporated to give GQD-N. GQD-N was added to a mixture of de-ionized water and H2O2 (volume ratio = 9:1) with a concentration of 20 mg mL−1. After vigorously stirring at room temperature for 24 h, the product was separated by centrifugation at 12000 rpm with poor solvent, ethanol and ether. The centrifugation was performed at least 4 times to remove residual H2O2. The obtained solid was further dried under vacuum at 70 °C to give GQD-NO with a total yield of 35%.
4.2 PSC device fabrication and measurement
PCDTBT was synthesized according to our previous report.38 PC71BM was purchased from American Dye Source and 1-material Chemscitech Inc. and used as received. ITO glass substrates were cleaned by ultra-sonication for 15 minutes each sequentially with iso-propanol, de-ionized water, acetone, and iso-propanol, followed by drying at 130 °C for 40 minutes and treatment with UV-ozone for 20 minutes. As for the GQD-NO CIL, GQD-NO (2 mg mL−1) in de-ionized water was spin-coated onto the ITO substrates at 2000 rpm for 1 min, followed by annealing at 120 °C for 10 min. As for the ZnO CIL, the ZnO precursor solution (0.04 mol L−1) in 2-methoxyethanol was spin-coated on ITO substrates at 3500 rpm for 1 minute followed by annealing at 200 °C for 1 hour.39 The modified substrates were transferred to a nitrogen-filled glove box. The PCDTBT:PC71BM (1:4 by weight) active layer was spin-coated from the o-dichlorobenzene (in total 17.5 mg mL−1) solution at 700 rpm for 2.5 minutes. The above substrates were annealed at 80 °C for 10 min and then transferred to a vacuum chamber. A 20 nm thick layer of MoO3 was deposited on the active layer under 2 × 10−4Pa vacuum. Al (100 nm) was deposited on top of the MoO3 anode layer. The active area of each device was 8.0 mm2. The J–V curves of the above PSC devices under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G simulated solar light illumination (XES-40S2-CE Class Solar Simulator, Japan, SAN-EI Electric Co., Ltd) were obtained using a Keithley 2400 source meter. The EQE spectra of the above PSC devices were measured with a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3011 (Enlitech Co., Ltd).
4.3 Characterization
High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images were recorded on a Philips-FEI tecnai F20 microscope (Philips, the Netherlands) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The sample for TEM measurement was made by depositing GQD-NO from an aqueous solution with a concentration of 2.0 mg mL−1 onto ultra-thin carbon film. The UPS and XPS measurements were carried out by using a VG Escalabmkll spectrometer (UK) with He I (21.2 eV for UPS) discharge lamp and Al Kα irradiation source (1486.7 eV for XPS) excitation. Film samples for UPS measurements were made by spin-coating GQD-NO in aqueous solution on ITO substrate using the same parameters as for PSC device fabrication. AFM in tapping mode was performed on an SPI 3800N Probe Station (Seiko Instruments Inc., Japan). The sample for AFM measurement was prepared by spin-coating the GQD-NO dispersion (0.1 mg mL−1) onto mica substrates at 2000 rpm for 2 minutes. UV/vis absorption spectra were measured using a PerkinElmer Lambda 35 UV/vis spectrometer. The solution sample for UV/vis absorption measurement was a GQD-NO dispersion in de-ionized water with a concentration of 0.1 mg mL−1. Solvent resistance of GQD-NO was investigated by the measurement of absorption intensity of the GQD-NO film before and after rinsing with dichlorobenzene. The film sample for UV/vis absorption measurement was made by spin-coating from a GQD-NO dispersion in de-ionized water (10 mg mL−1). The GQD-NO film was rinsed with dichlorobenzene via spin-coating at 2000 rpm for 1 min followed by annealing at 150 °C for 10 min.
