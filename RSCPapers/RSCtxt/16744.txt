    , Accepted 9th December 2019First published on 9th December 2019AbstractTo construct a supercapacitor (SC) with considerable performance, synthesis of an electrode material with a highly porous structure is necessary. Herein, an efficient metal–organic framework (MOF)-derived procedure is offered to construct a graphene wrapped multi-shelled NiGa2O4 hollow sphere (GW-MSNGOHS) positive electrode material and a graphene-wrapped yolk–shell NiFe2O4 hollow sphere (GW-YS-NFOHS) negative electrode material with a highly porous nature in SCs. The GW-MSNGOHS and GW-YS-NFOHS electrodes exhibit excellent capacities (∼411.25 mA h g−1 and 254.25 mA h g−1, respectively, at 1 A g−1), reasonable rate performances (75.85%, and 62.7%, respectively), and outstanding cyclability (98.9% and 90.9%, respectively). Benefiting from the reasonably engineered negative and positive electrodes, the fabricated asymmetric device (GW-MSNGOHS//GW-YS-NFOHS) can show an excellent energy density (ED) of 118.97 W h kg−1 at a power density (PD) of 1702 W kg−1, an exceptional robustness of 92.1%, and an excellent capacity (Cs) of 140.2 mA g−1.
1. Introduction
Due to environmental problems and fossil fuel depletion, the sustainable development of electrical energy storage has become one of the greatest societal challenges. To address this crisis, favorable electrochemical energy storage systems are in high demand.1,2 At the forefront of electrochemical energy storage systems, supercapacitors (SCs) are one of the main representatives with excellent features such as excellent safety, round-trip efficiency, low cost, fast rechargeability, remarkable power density, and tremendous durability.3–7
The performance of SCs is intensively affected by the design, morphology, and nature of their electrode materials. In this regard, several research groups have constructed more efficient materials with distinct architectures to attain better energy storage performance.8–10 Accordingly, boosting the performance of SCs is attributed to the construction and design of electrode materials with a porous nature and high surface area, which play a vital role in boosting the energy density of SCs and enhancing their robustness.11,12
As a vital family of hollow nanostructures, yolk–shell and multi-shell hollow spheres comprise internal voids and shells, which bestow them various distinctive features, such as tunable porosity, reasonable surface area (SA), outstanding mechanical strength and low specific density.13,14 Considering the exclusive features of such nanoarchitectures, substantial effort has been made to exploit various strategies for constructing complex hollow nanoarchitectures. Among these routes, self-templating procedures are more suitable procedures for attaining complex hollow nanoarchitectures due to the scalable and cost-effective processes.15,16
Besides the nanostructure, the type of material used in an electrode also affects the performance of SCs. Thus, searching for a better electrode material has been a main challenge for the further improvement of SCs. As a rapidly growing family of electrode materials, MOFs have attracted lots of attention for their rational applications in fuel cells, solar cells, Li-ion batteries, sensors, water splitting, and SCs, due to their exclusive properties of chemical diversity, excellent crystalline structure, and remarkable SA and porosity.17–21 Lately, countless research studies have centralized on the construction and design of MOFs with tunable architectures. MOFs show advantages such as available coordinated metal sites–organic molecules and tunable pore nanostructures.22
Transition metal oxides (TMOs) with various metal cations (e.g. spinels) have been considered as an intriguing type of material for several electrochemical applications including SCs, electrocatalysts and Li-ion batteries.23,24 Among the TMOs, nickel-based ones have been explored as highly efficient electrode materials for SCs, due to their great redox reaction property, environmental affability, good chemical affinity with the current collector (nickel substrate) and satisfactory theoretical capacitance.25 Nevertheless, the poor energy density and low robustness impose limitations on their applications, particularly for SCs, thus persuading us to design intriguing electrodes from these pseudocapacitive TMOs.
To overcome the discussed limitations of TMOs and boost their current performances, various design strategies have been suggested: (i) incorporating suitable elements (e.g. gallium) in spinels; (ii) synthesizing nanoarchitectures with exclusive porous textures; and (iii) combining with conductive materials (e.g. graphene).26–28
Very recently, NiGa2O4 has been explored for SC applications, resulting in excellent durability. The role of the gallium (Ga) element in boosting the robustness of the NiGa2O4 spinel has been investigated by Jun et al.26 for SCs but it is still unclear. Jun et al. demonstrated that the enhanced ion diffusion kinetics and improved stability of the NiGa2O4 spinel originated from the aliovalent substitution of Ga3+ for Ni2+ in the NiGa2O4 nanostructure.
Positive electrode materials have been appreciably explored and significant improvement has been achieved, while the fabrication of negative electrode materials with exclusive nanoarchitectures has not yet been studied. Accordingly, it is highly advisable to investigate superior negative electrode materials with a porous nature and significant capacitance to achieve the improved energy density of SCs. Pseudocapacitive negative electrode materials have attracted great attention. Among them, NiFe2O4 is a promising negative electrode due to its substantial theoretical capacitance, wide voltage window, and good redox reversibility.29
Herein, we constructed graphene wrapped multi-shelled NiGa2O4 hollow spheres (GW-MSNGOHS) with an outstanding surface area of 115.2 m2 g−1 as a new positive electrode material for SCs. In this architecture, the graphene sheets not only function as a protective agent to ameliorate the structural stability of NiGa2O4 and hinder the aggregation of multi-shelled NiGa2O4 hollow spheres but also adjust the electronic attributes of the oxide to speed up the ion and electron transfer kinetics. Furthermore, we developed a graphene wrapped yolk–shelled NiFe2O4 hollow sphere (GW-YS-NFOHS) negative electrode to improve the energy density of SCs. Benefiting from the distinctive structural characteristics of both electrodes, when the electrodes were employed in a 3-electrode setup, the GW-MSNGOHS electrode showed an outstanding Cs of 411.25 mA h g−1 and an excellent robustness of 98.9% and the GW-YS-NFOHS electrode showed a satisfactory Cs of 254.25 mA h g−1 and excellent cyclability. Considering the merits of the GW-MSNGOHS and GW-YS-NFOHS electrodes, we constructed an advanced device with superior energy density. The assembled GW-MSNGOHS//GW-YS-NFOHS device shows an exceptional energy density of 118.97 W h kg−1 and the desired robustness of 92.1%. Besides, the real applicability of the GW-MSNGOHS//GW-YS-NFOHS device was corroborated with a glowing light-emitting diode (LED). We strongly believe that our study plays a pivotal role in the production of high-performance SCs using porous structures.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
All materials were procured from Merck and Sigma-Aldrich corporations including triethoxysilane (APTES), iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O), acetone (C3H6O), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sodium nitrate (NaNO3), gallium(III) nitrate hydrate (Ga(NO3)3·xH2O), powdered graphite, isophthalic acid (H2IPA, C8H6O4), nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O), dimethylformamide (DMF, C3H7NO), 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (C8H6O4, BDC), ethylene glycol (C2H6O2), potassium permanganate (KMnO4) and potassium hydroxide (KOH). A bare nickel foam substrate (BNF) was used as a current collector.
2.2. Synthesis of the GW-MSNGOHS
To synthesize MSNGOHS, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (34.8 mg), Ga(NO3)3·xH2O (61.35 mg based on the molecular weight of the anhydrous salt), and H2IPA (59.6 mg) were added into acetone (20 mL) and DMF (20 mL) under stirring for 6 h. After 6 h of stirring, the solution was conveyed into an autoclave and protected at 160 °C for 4 h. Afterward, the Ni–Ga precursors were carefully separated via centrifugation and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. The as-synthesized Ni–Ga-precursors were annealed at different temperatures ranging from 350 to 500 °C in air for 10 min at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 to control the shell numbers. Graphene oxide was constructed using the Hummers’ method.30 Typically, 0.2 g of the MSNGOHS was dispersed in 20 mL isopropyl alcohol containing 0.2 mL 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane, followed by stirring overnight to create a positively charged surface on the MSNGOHS. After centrifugation, the product was dispersed in water (40 mL) and mixed with a GO suspension (2 mg mL−1, 60 mL) for 6 hours. After stirring for 6 h, the product was collected through centrifugation and treated at 500 °C for 4 hours under an Ar atmosphere to obtain the GW-MSNGOHS (Scheme 1).

2.3. Synthesis of the GW-YS-NFOHS
To synthesise YS-NFOHS, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (116.3 mg), Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (323.2 mg) and 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (25 mg) were mixed into DMF (20 mL) and ethylene glycol (6 mL) under stirring for 1 h. Then, the solution was added into an autoclave for 6 h at 120 °C. The precipitate was gathered through centrifugation and dried at 50 °C for 12 h. Finally, the YS-NFOHS were constructed via annealing the as-fabricated Ni–Fe-precursors at 400 °C for 1 h in air with a heating rate of 1 °C min−1. The same method for the synthesis of GW-MSNGOHS was followed to fabricate GW-YS-NFOHS. The YS-NFOHS (0.2 g), APTES (0.2 mL) and isopropyl alcohol (20 mL) were mixed and stirred overnight. Afterward, the product was carefully centrifuged. The obtained powder was dispersed in water (40 mL) and mixed with graphene oxide (2 mg mL−1, 60 mL). After stirring for 6 h, the product was obtained through centrifugation and treated for 4 h at 500 °C under an Ar atmosphere (Scheme 2).

2.4. Characterization
The crystallographic phases of the MSNGOHS, GW-MSNGOHS, YS-NFOHS and GW-YS-NFOHS samples were explored via X-ray diffraction (XRD) with a Philips X'pert diffractometer. An X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) system along with an ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer is used to monitor the electron states in the GW-MSNGOHS and GW-YS-NFOHS nanostructures. To detect the SA and pore size distributions of MSNGOHS, GW-MSNGOHS, YS-NFOHS and GW-YS-NFOHS, a Micromeritics ASAP-2010 system equipped with Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) methods was used. To investigate the morphologies of the as-fabricated samples, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) methods were employed.
2.5. Electrochemical evaluation
In the 3-electrode arrangement, we selected Pt wire (reference electrode) and Ag/AgCl (counter electrode), while the working electrodes (MSNGOHS, GW-MSNGOH, YS-NFOHS and GW-YS-NFOHS) were fabricated by covering a paste of MSNGOHS, GW-MSNGOH, YS-NFOHS, and GW-YS-NFOHS (85%), polyvinylidene fluoride (5%) and acetylene black (10%) in acetone on the nickel foam electrode. Meanwhile, the device (GW-MSNGOH//GW-YS-NFOHS) was constructed using the as-mentioned GW-MSNGOH (positive), GW-YS-NFOHS (negative) and a piece of cellulose paper (separator) in KOH (6 M).
To determine the capacity (Cs mA h g−1) of single electrodes, eqn (1) was employed, in which I, Δt and m stand for the current, discharge time and mass loading of various active materials. (1)
For the GW-MSNGOH//GW-YS-NFOHS device assembly, the mass ratio of GW-MSNGOHS and GW-YS-NFOHS electrodes is determined according to eqn (2): (2)where the subscripts of + and − are related to the positive (GW-MSNGOHS) and negative (GW-YS-NFOHS) electrodes, and C and m stand for the mass and capacity of electrodes. The mass ratio of the GW-MSNGOHS to GW-YS-NFOHS is optimized to 6.2:10. Consequently, GW-MSNGOHS positive and GW-YS-NFOHS negative electrodes with 2.8 mg and 4.5 mg were constructed.
The power density (PD, W kg−1) and energy density (ED, W h kg−1) of the GW-MSNGOHS//GW-YS-NFOHS device can be estimated using eqn (4) and (3): (3) (4)
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of GW-MSNGOHS
The purity and crystallographic phase of the MSNGOHS and GW-MSNGOHS samples were evaluated via XRD investigation, as reflected in Fig. 1a. The XRD pattern for the MSNGOHS sample illustrates distinctive peaks at 30.55°, 36.05°, 37.25°, 43.8°, 54.3°, 58.2°, and 63.6°, corresponding to the (220), (311), (222), (400), (422), (511) and (440) planes, respectively, of the crystalline MSNGOHS (JCPDS card no. 10-0114).31 Furthermore, the broad peak indicated at about 25° for the GW-MSNGOHS sample originated from graphene, which confirms that GO perfectly changed into graphene.32 To better verify the oxidation states and surface elemental configuration of the GW-MSNGOHS sample, the XPS study was performed, as indicated in Fig. 1b–g. The full spectrum of the GW-MSNGOHS sample (Fig. 1b) reflects the existence of gallium (Ga), carbon (C), nickel (Ni) and oxygen (O) elements in the sample. The C 1s peaks located at 284.65 eV (CC), 286.65 eV (C–O), 287.9 (CO) and 288.74 eV (O–CO) (Fig. 1c), indicate the existence of graphene in the sample.33 Ni 2p3/2 (854.15 eV for Ni2+ and 855.67 eV for Ni3+) and Ni 2p1/2 (871.85 eV for Ni2+ and 873.45 eV for Ni3+) reflect the presence of Ni2+ and Ni3+ states in the GW-MSNGOHS sample (Fig. 1d).34 Besides, the satellite peaks are reflected at 860.95 and 878.65 eV. The positions of the peaks of Ga 2p at 1117.87 and 1144.65 eV with a separation energy of 26.77 eV are indicative of Ga 2p3/2 and Ga 2p1/2 of GW-MSNGOHS, respectively (Fig. 1e).23 The Ga 3d spectrum as indicated in Fig. 1f shows that the two peaks at 19.05 eV and 21.28 eV are ascribed to Ga 3d5/2 and Ga 3d3/2.26Fig. 1g shows the XPS spectrum of O 1s, and the three distinctive peaks can be named O3, O2, and O1. The O1 peak at 529.95 eV is related to metal (M)–oxygen (O) bonds; the O2 at 531.05 eV is allocated to the defect sites with low oxygen coordination, contaminants, and surface species; the O3 peak located at 532.45 eV is indexed to the multiplicity of physisorbed/chemisorbed water at or near the surface.35 It is widely accepted that the pore size of materials and SA play pivotal roles in boosting the properties of the SCs. To verify the SA and pore size distribution of MSNGOHS and GW-MSNGOHS samples, BET examination was conducted, as shown in Fig. 1h. As is evident, the as-prepared MSNGOHS and GW-MSNGOHS samples revealed a kind IV isotherm along with a hysteresis loop, affirming nanoporous architectures.36 The SA of the GW-MSNGOHS sample was found to be 115.2 m2 g−1, with a pore size of 2.4 nm, whereas the MSNGOHS sample exhibited an SA of 72.6 m2 g−1 with a pore size of 3 nm. The GW-MSNGOHS sample has a substantial SA, which is due to the incorporation of extra pores between the MSNGOHS sample and the graphene shells. The large SA and presence of nanopores can promote the electron/ion transport kinetics and thereby lead to better electrochemical properties of the GW-MSNGOHS sample.37–39

The detailed internal structures and morphologies of the MSNGOHS and GW-MSNGOHS samples were obtained by FE-SEM and TEM, as shown in Fig. 1i–p and Fig. S1 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), we first produced uniform Ni–Ga-precursors with an unwrinkled spherical appearance. After the annealing of NGP, the sample is changed into NiGa2O4 with a wrinkled, porous and rough structure (Fig. 1i and j). As is clear from Fig. 1k, the surface of the NiGa2O4 sphere becomes rough and wrinkled, reflecting the organization of narrow shells. As shown by TEM in Fig. 1l, the as-synthesized NiGa2O4 sphere is composed of more than four narrow shells with highly wrinkled layers. Many interconnected segments between the wrinkled neighboring shells can be observed throughout the structure, which can boost the structural robustness of this material. The elemental gallium (Ga), nickel (Ni) and oxygen (O) distributions in the MSGNOHS were better investigated via SEM mapping and are shown in Fig. S2a–e.† The morphology of the GW-MSNGOHS sample is shown in Fig. 1m–p. The FE-SEM of GW-MSNGOHS reveals that the NiGa2O4 spheres are encapsulated by graphene sheets (Fig. 1m–o). As expected, the NiGa2O4 spheres which are wrapped in the graphene sheets can be easily observed in the TEM image (Fig. 1p). Owing to the flexible and highly thin texture of graphene, the multi-shell structure of NiGa2O4 spheres is still seen, indicating that a direct contact between NiGa2O4 and the graphene texture can be achieved. Therefore, according to the FE-SEM and TEM investigations, graphene sheets perfectly encapsulated NiGa2O4 spheres via cordial contact to form a unique structure with a porous nature, which can help accelerate the ion and electron transfer and augment the structural robustness of the electrodes; so the enhanced electrochemical performance can be achieved.
3.2. The formation mechanism of the GW-MSNGOHS
The formation of the MSNGOHS via the thermal decomposition of Ni-IPA–Ga MOF spheres is largely according to the heterogeneous contraction originating from heat treatment. To demonstrate the formation mechanism of the GW-MSNGOHS nanoarchitecture, examinations through FE-SEM and TEM are carried out to investigate the morphological evolution. Fig. 2a–e show the FE-SEM images of the GW-MSNGOHS from a rigid sphere to a multi-shelled sphere. The FE-SEM image of the Ni–Ga-precursor reflects that the Ni–Ga-precursor is composed of rigid spheres without explicit pores (Fig. 2a). As revealed in Fig. 2b, after heating at 350 °C for 10 min, the spheres are still rigid but exhibit low porosity. After heating at 400 °C for 10 min, the roughness and porosity of the spheres increase (Fig. 2c). After annealing to 500 °C, the reaction is ended and the surfaces of the spheres become most wrinkled (Fig. 2d). As reflected in Fig. 2e, the sphere is perfectly wrapped within the rGO network. Besides, Fig. 2f schematically reveals the structural and morphological evolution of the GW-MSNGOHS from a solid sphere to a multi-shelled sphere. A TEM study is employed to distinguish the intermediates obtained at various thermal decomposition steps. The structural conversion from a solid sphere to a multi-shelled sphere involves different stages (Fig. 2g–k). As is seen from Fig. 2g, the Ni–Ga-IPA solid spheres were obtained by solvothermal reactions. At the first step of annealing, there exists a high-temperature gradient (ΔT) alongside the radial direction, which causes the formation of the first shell of MSNGOHS at the surface of the Ni–Ga-IPA core. Along with the increase in temperature, two forces with opposite directions are generated on the interface of the NiGa2O4 shell and the Ni–Ga-IPA core. The adhesion force (Fa) is derived from the NiGa2O4 shell which hinders its inner contraction, while another contraction force (Fc) originating from the oxygenolysis of the organic species accompanying the formation of NiGa2O4 crystallites promotes the inward shrinkage of the Ni–Ga-IPA core. With a high ΔT (Fc > Fa), the more inward contraction leads to the differentiation of the core from the shell, hence forming a yolk–shell structure, as reflected in Fig. 2h. With long-lasting annealing, the same conversion process for the internal core can occur several times (Fig. 2i), until the Fc declines with the decreased ΔT. When Fa > Fc, the mass diffusion direction creates a perfect reversal and thereby generates outward contraction and a cavity at the center (Fig. 2j). The porous texture with several shells is assigned to the disintegration of organic species. Accordingly, unique multi-shelled NiGa2O4 hollow spheres (MSNGOHS) are obtained. Finally, the multi-shelled architectures of NiGa2O4 spheres are wrapped in graphene with the flexible and highly thin texture (Fig. 2k).

3.3. Characterization of the GW-YS-NFOHS
To elucidate the phase compositions and crystalline nature of GW-YS-NFOHS and YS-NFOHS, XRD was carried out. As shown in Fig. 3a, the peaks located at various 2θ values in the pattern of the YS-NFOHS match excellently with the (111), (220), (311), (222), (400), (422), (511), (440), (620), (533), (622) and (444) reflections of the YS-NFOHS phase (JCPDS no. 10-0325).40 The additional wide peak manifested nearly at 25° for the GW-YS-NFOHS is related to the (002) diffraction plane of graphene, which proves that the graphene oxide was successfully changed into graphene.41 Furthermore, an XPS study was conducted to interpret the valence states of the GW-YS-NFOHS sample. The XPS survey of the GW-YS-NFOHS proves the existence of iron (Fe), carbon (C), oxygen (O) and nickel (Ni) elements (Fig. S3†) in the GW-YS-NFOHS. The C 1s XPS spectrum of the GW-YS-NFOHS (Fig. 3b up) is deconvoluted into four peaks at 284.55 eV (CC), 286.65 eV (C–O), 287.9 eV (CO), and 288.78 eV (COO).42 Considering the Ni 2p spectrum in Fig. 3b bottom, the binding energies (BEs) located at 853.87 (Ni 2p3/2) and 872.78 eV (Ni 2p1/2) are assigned to Ni2+ and Ni3+, respectively, and the BEs situated at 857.18 eV and 874.37 eV are ascribed to Ni3+ and Ni2+, respectively.43 In Fe 2p, two peaks related to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 can be observed. Meanwhile, the BEs of 723.9 eV and 718.18 can be assigned to Fe 2p1/2 and a shakeup satellite, reflecting the coexistence of Fe3+ and Fe2+ (Fig. 3c up).44 The O 1s spectrum is shown in Fig. 3c bottom. The peak located at a BE of 529.9 eV (O1) has been identified as a Ni–Fe–O bond. The peak at 530.8 eV (O2) can be ascribed to hydroxyls. Furthermore, the peak found at 531.7 eV (O3) can be ascribed to the chemical and physical absorption of H2O.29 The SA values of the GW-YS-NFOHS and YS-NFOHS samples were determined through the BET method and are shown in Fig. 3d. As shown in Fig. 3d, the GW-YS-NFOHS and YS-NFOHS nanomaterials have a type IV isotherm along with a hysteresis. The SA of GW-YS-NFOHS is found to be 70.2 m2 g−1, considerably higher than that of YS-NFOHS (48.6 m2 g−1). The greater SA of GW-YS-NFOHS can be related to the presence of graphene, and the formation of pores between the YS-NFOHS and graphene. Furthermore, the BJH results of the GW-YS-NFOHS and YS-NFOHS (inset of Fig. 3d) reflect that the GW-YS-NFOHS and YS-NFOHS samples have their pore size distributions located at 6.5 nm and 7.8 nm, respectively. The greater SA is expected to simplify the ion/electron transport pathways and boost the robustness and rate performance of the negative electrode in KOH (6 M).45Fig. 3e–j and Fig. S4† show the interior and morphological structures of the Ni–Fe precursor, YS-NFOHS and GW-YS-NFOHS determined by FE-SEM along with TEM. Fig. S4† shows the structure of the sphere of the Ni–Fe precursor with a smooth surface. The FE-SEM image of the YS-NFOHS reveals that the YS-NFOHS architecture consists of regular spheres with a porous texture (Fig. 3e). Furthermore, the exterior surface of the microspheres is composed of ultra-small particles, which could create a porous nanoarchitecture. A broken sphere shows that the YS-NFOHS is composed of a rough surface with a yolk–shell nanostructure (Fig. 3f). The elemental mapping of the YS-NFOHS nanostructure proves the presence of iron (Fe), nickel (Ni) and oxygen (O) elements (Fig. S5†). Besides, the interior hollow nanostructures are explored using TEM. As indicated in Fig. 3f, the obvious void between the internal yolk and external shell can be observed. The obvious void can develop the electrode–electrolyte contact area, resulting in an enhanced electrochemical performance. The structural morphology of the GW-YS-NFOHS was investigated using the FE-SEM method, as shown in Fig. 3h and i, which show that the YS-NFOHS nanostructures are perfectly encapsulated by the graphene scaffold. Most significantly, the graphene encapsulated YS-NFOHS nanostructures interlock with each other to form a 3D nanoarchitecture, which shortens the electron/ion transport route, resulting in excellent performances. The TEM image demonstrates that the YS-NFOHS nanostructures are encapsulated by the graphene network. Besides, the TEM investigation reflects that graphene encapsulated the YS-NFOHS, demonstrating the good synergistic interaction between the YS-NFOHS nanostructures and graphene nanosheets. Fig. 3j shows a TEM image of the GW-YS-NFOHS, which proves that the YS-NFOHS is encapsulated by graphene, which is useful in boosting the durability throughout the consecutive charge/discharge process via preventing the YS-NFOHS nanostructures from self-aggregation.

3.4. The formation mechanism of the GW-YS-NFOHS
Our procedure for the formation of GW-YS-NFOHS is shown in Fig. 4. In the initial stage, uniform Ni–Fe-BDC precursors are fabricated through a solvothermal route as elucidated in the Experimental section. The Ni–Fe-BDC precursor can be simply changed to the YS-NFOHS through thermal decomposition of rigid spheres. FE-SEM and TEM images along with the detailed schematic of the spheres, from the Ni–Fe-BDC precursor to GW-YS-NFOHS sample, are shown in Fig. 4. The Ni–Fe-BDC solid spheres were constructed through the bonding of Ni and Fe metal ions with the BDC. As shown in Fig. 4a and g, the Ni–Fe-BDC is made of rigid spheres without observable pores. After heating at 150 °C for one hour, the Ni–Fe-BDC precursors still show a rigid appearance but demonstrate a rougher surface with packed nanoparticles, which indicate the beginning of Ni–Fe-BDC decomposition (Fig. 4b and h). After heating at 300 °C for one hour, there is an explicit gap between an evident shell and a rigid core, constructing an exclusive core–shell nanoarchitecture (Fig. 4c and l). Such a core–shell nanoarchitecture possesses a clear shell containing NiFe2O4, whilst maintaining a core of Ni–Fe-BDC. By boosting the temperature to 400 °C, the roughness of the core–shell nanoarchitecture improves and the reaction is terminated (Fig. 4d and g). The FE-SEM and TEM images of the GW-YS-NFOHS reflect that the graphene scaffold wraps the yolk–shell structure to create a 3D graphene wrapped yolk–shell structure (Fig. 4e and k).

3.5. Electrochemical properties of GW-MSNGOHS and GW-YS-NFOHS electrodes
For providing the notable electrochemical behaviors of GW-MSNGOHS, GW-YS-NFOHS, MSNGOHS, and YS-NFOHS, the variant electrochemical methods (e.g. electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) and cyclic voltammetry (CV)) were conducted, first in a 3-electrode arrangement in KOH (6 M). The CV curves of the GW-MSNGOHS, MSNGOHS and current collector (NF) at 50 mV s−1 are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). As reflected in Fig. S6,† the area under a curve of NF is highly enclosed, which implies that NF holds unimportant capacity. This result demonstrates that the capacitive properties of the NF backbone were worthless. Most significantly, two distinctly redox peaks with a clear potential separation are evident for GW-MSNGOHS and MSNGOHS, implying that the behavior of both electrodes is battery-type. Besides, when comparing the curves of the GW-MSNGOHS and MSNGOHS, it is evident that the GW-MSNGOHS shows a bigger CV area and greater reduction/oxidation peak intensity compared to the MSNGOHS, revealing prompt redox kinetics processes. This could have originated from the synergistic effects of the graphene network and NiGa2O4, as well as the boost in the SA, related to the embodiment of graphene nanosheets. It is widely known that the potential separation between the cathodic and anodic peaks (ΔEp) is a significant agent for evaluating the electrocatalytic properties of electrodes. As indicated in Fig. S6,† the ΔEp of the GW-MSNGOHS is slightly lower than that of the MSNGOHS electrode. This result implies that the electrochemical behavior of the GW-MSNGOHS is more reversible than that of MSNGOHS. Furthermore, the lower ΔEp value of the GW-MSNGOHS proves that this electrode presents remarkable electrocatalytic properties in KOH throughout the energy storage process.46 Most importantly, the redox peaks with distinct anodic and cathodic peaks discerned in the CV of GW-MSNGOHS and MSNGOHS electrodes can be assigned to the redox reactions related to Ni–O/Ni–O–OH which may be associated with OH− in the alkaline environment. This is in excellent match with the previous investigation about NiGa2O4 as a positive electrode for SC applications.26Fig. 5a shows the CV plots of the GW-MSNGOHS electrode at dissimilar scan rates (5 to 50 mV s−1). Obviously, with the boost in the scan rates, a similar CV plot shape along with the symmetric redox peaks are observed, revealing the exceptional pseudocapacitive behavior of the GW-MSNGOHS battery-type electrode.47 The CV plots of the MSNGOHS electrode at various scan rates (5 to 50 mV s−1) are illustrated in Fig. S7a.† As revealed in Fig. S7a,† on boosting the scan rate, all of the plots retain their shapes, indicating that the MSNGOHS has perfect redox features. GCD as the main characterization route for SCs was also employed to calculate the capacity of electrodes. The GCD profiles were plotted for the GW-MSNGOHS electrode (Fig. 5b) with various current densities (1 to 25 A g−1). In Fig. 5b, obvious GCD plateaus are observed for the GW-MSNGOHS, matching excellently with the corresponding peaks in the CV plots. The GCD plots of the MSNGOH electrode at different current densities (1 to 25 A g−1) are shown in Fig. S7b.† The observations reflected that all plots demonstrate non-linear properties, which reveals that the charge storage is achieved using the redox process.48

(c) Rate capability of the MSNGOHS and GW-MSNGOHS electrodes. (d) Durability of the MSNGOHS and GW-MSNGOHS electrodes. (e) CV curves of the GW-YS-NFOHS electrode at various scan rates. (f) GCD plots of the GW-YS-NFOHS at various current densities. (g) Rate performance of the YS-NFOHS and GW-YS-NFOHS electrodes. (h) Durability of the YS-NFOHS and GW-YS-NFOHS electrodes. 
The obtained capacities of GW-MSNGOHS and MSNGOHS electrodes from 1 to 25 A g−1 are shown in Fig. 5c. The MSNGOHS electrode showed capacities as high as 300.1 mA h g−1, 283.6 mA h g−1, 264.6 mA h g−1, 216.8 mA h g−1 and 207.65 mA h g−1 at 1, 3, 9, 18 and 25 A g−1, respectively. Due to the presence of the Ga element in the NiGa2O4 structure, the electrical conductivity is increased and therefore the rate capability is improved. Furthermore, the presence of gallium boosts quicker charge-transfer kinetics, consequently enhancing the capacitance.26
Furthermore, the GW-MSNGOHS electrode shows capacities as high as 411.25 mA h g−1, 390.9 mA h g−1, 353.38 mA h g−1, 325.75 mA h g−1 and 312.26 mA h g−1 at 1, 3, 9, 18 and 25 A g−1, respectively. For the GW-MSNGOHS electrode, 75.85% of the primary capacity was maintained at 25 A g−1, which was better than that of the GW-MSNGOHS (69.2%). These observations prove that the GW-MSNGOHS showed extraordinary rate performance over the MSNGOHS electrode owing to the excellent electrochemical conductivity and synergistic effects of graphene sheets and NiGa2O4. The GCD and CV analyses proved that the GW-MSNGOHS showed excellent electrochemical behavior, superior to various TMO based battery-type electrodes (Table S1 in the ESI†). EIS examinations were conducted to study extra kinetic behaviors of battery-type electrodes. Fig. S8† shows the Nyquist plots of GW-MSNGOHS and GW-MSNGOHS electrodes. The GW-MSNGOHS demonstrated a smaller charge transfer impedance (Rct), internal resistance (Rs) and a larger slope line than the MSNGOHS, which proves that the GW-MSNGOHS had rapid ion-electron transport kinetics throughout the redox process.49 These EIS data further affirm that the GW-MSNGOHS electrode shows excellent conductivity due to the synergistic effects of the graphene network and NiGa2O4, which could boost the electrochemical properties with exclusive redox reaction kinetics. Cyclability is one of the vital parameters to study the behavior of SCs. The cyclability of GW-MSNGOHS and MSNGOHS were evaluated via sequential CD cycles at 25 A g−1. As reflected in Fig. 5d, the MSNGOHS and GW-MSNGOHS possess enhanced durability. In particular, the GW-MSNGOHS can still retain 98.9% capacity even after cycling 10000 times, whereas only 95.8% was maintained by the MSNGOHS. The excellent robustness of the GW-MSNGOHS and MSNGOHS electrodes can be attributed to (i) the presence of the Ga element in NiGa2O4 that can enhance the conductivity of the MSNGOHS and GW-MSNGOHS throughout the electrochemical reaction; as a result, an enhanced durability for MSNGOHS and GW-MSNGOHS battery-type electrodes is achieved. (ii) The formation of shells in MSNGOHS and GW-MSNGOHS can facilitate the ion/electron transport paths, resulting in enhanced structural stability. (iii) The graphene scaffold can effectually hamper the aggregation of nanostructures and prevent deterioration throughout the charge–discharge process, resulting in a boost in the robustness of the electrodes. EIS examination was carried out for the GW-MSNGOHS and MSNGOHS electrodes after the durability test, and the EIS data are shown in Fig. S9a and S9b.† They reflect a marginal enhancement in charge transfer impedance values after a 10000 CD cycle test for both electrodes. The GCD plots of the GW-MSNGOHS from the 1st to 20th CD cycles and curves from 9981st to 10000th CD cycles are shown in Fig. S10a and S10b,† respectively. The last twenty GCD plots illustrate insignificant changes when compared with the first twenty GCD plots, revealing that the GW-MSNGOHS electrode shows excellent cyclability. To demonstrate the exceptional robustness of the MSNGOHS electrode, the first 20 and last 20 GCDs of the MSNGOHS electrode are shown in Fig. S11a and S11b.† A slight deviation is observed at the 10000th CD cycle related to the first CD cycle, indicating that the MSNGOHS has outstanding cyclability. The morphological variations of the GW-MSNGOHS and MSNGOHS after the 10000 CD cycles are shown in Fig. S12a–d.† The FE-SEM and TEM images show that the GW-MSNGOHS and MSNGOHS retain their original nanostructures, even after 10000 CD cycles in KOH and better indicate the excellent robustness of GW-MSNGOHS and MSNGOHS electrodes. Aside from the examination of the positive electrode (GW MSNGOHS), we have also developed a graphene-wrapped yolk–shell NiFe2O4 hollow sphere (GW-YS-NFOHS) negative electrode to boost the energy density of the asymmetric device as a favorable alternative for active carbon due to its merits of high SA, exclusive porous nature and excellent redox behavior. To explore the electrochemical behavior of the electrodes, the CV plots of GW-YSNFOHS and YSNFOHS electrodes were recorded in a potential window of −1.1 to 0.0 V at 50 mV s−1 as shown in Fig. S13.† In Fig. S13,† the GW-YS-NFOHS electrode shows a greater CV plot area than the YS-NFOHS electrode, revealing that the GW-YS-NFOHS possesses the superior capacity. Interestingly, a couple of redox peaks are reflected within a potential window of −1.1–0.0 V, which is due to the reversible redox nature of Fe3+/Fe2+ or Ni2+/Ni3+. The energy storage mechanism for the anode electrode is proposed as follows:29 NiFe2O4 + H2O + 2e− ↔ NiO + 2FeO + 2OH−(5)
The CV curves of the GW-YS-NFOHS electrode at diverse scan rates (5 to 50 mV s−1) are shown in Fig. 5e. As indicated in Fig. 5e, all CV plots represented a pair of symmetrical and a couple of redox peaks, reflecting its exceptional electrochemical reversibility. Most significantly, the GW-YS-NFOHS electrode maintains and preserves the shapes of plots, even at 50 mV s−1, indicating that the GW-YS-NFOHS electrode has good capacitive properties with a good rate capability. This substantial rate capability originates from its exclusive porous nanoarchitecture, large SA, and good synergistic effect of the YS-NFOHS with the graphene network. Besides, the CV plots of the YS-NFOHS electrode at various sweep rates (5 to 50 mV s−1) are shown in Fig. S14a.† The plots at all scan rates demonstrated a couple of redox peaks, which were derived from faradaic reactions of NiFe2O4 in KOH. The GCD plots of the GW-YS-NFOHS electrode at various current densities (1 to 20 A g−1) are shown in Fig. 5f. In Fig. 5f, all plots represent non-linear shapes, which implies that the charge storage is achieved by the faradaic process. Furthermore, the GW-YS-NFOHS electrode showed the battery-type behavior owing to the redox activity of the Fe2+/Fe3+ couple which was in excellent agreement with CV profiles. Furthermore, the GCD profiles of the YS-NFOHS electrode from 1 to 20 A g−1 are shown in Fig. S14b.† As reflected, all curves represented a couple of redox plateaus, which is in good agreement with CV observations. These results prove that the presence of the graphene network in the YS-NFOHS plays a vital role in the improvement of the electrochemical properties. The capacities of the GW-YS-NFOHS and YS-NFOHS electrodes were evaluated from the GCD plots at various current densities, and the obtained data are shown in Fig. 5g. The GW-YS-NFOHS electrode exhibited capacities as high as ∼254.25, 240.4, 220.75, 193.8 and 159.4 mA h g−1 at 1, 2, 4, 10 and 20 A g−1, respectively. Also, the YS-NFOHS electrode exhibited capacities as high as ∼175.9, 158.5, 142.2, 108.3 and 89.7 mA h g−1 at 1, 2, 4, 10 and 20 A g−1, respectively. The GW-YS-NFOHS electrode still retains a good capacity value of 159.4 mA h g−1 with a retention of 62.7%, which is better than that of the YS-NFOHS electrode (50.6%). Besides, EIS was conducted for the GW-YS-NFOHS and YS-NFOHS electrodes to obtain strong evidence regarding the electrochemical behavior of the electrodes (e.g. diffusion resistance (RW), charge-transfer resistance (Rct), and solution resistance (RS)), and the Nyquist curves are shown in Fig. S15.† As shown in Fig. S15,† the GW-YS-NFOHS electrode showed small Rct and RS values, which were smaller than those of the YS-NFOHS electrode. Such small Rct and RS values of the GW-YS-NFOHS electrode were due to the exclusive architecture of the GW-YS-NFOHS with the porous scaffold. Besides, the GW-YS-NFOHS electrode represented a more vertical line compared to the YS-NFOHS, which indicates that the GW-YS-NFOHS electrode had fast ion and electron transport kinetics throughout the redox reactions. The cyclability of the GW-YS-NFOHS and YS-NFOHS electrodes was verified by the GCD method with 5000 GCD cycles and the data are shown in Fig. 5h. The GW-YS-NFOHD electrode reflects considerable robustness with a capacity retention of 90.9% after 5000 sequential cycles (Fig. 5h). The obtained data are better than those of the YS-NFOHD electrode (86.3%). The enhanced durability could be related to the exclusive architecture of the GW-YS-NFOHS with good SA and an exclusive porous scaffold and excellent synergistic interactions between the YS-NFOHS and the graphene sheets. To confirm the durability, EIS was conducted for the GW-YS-NFOHS and YS-NFOHS electrodes before and after 5000 GCD cycles (Fig. S16†). The GCD of the GW-YS-NFOHS from the 1st to 20th CD cycles and plots from 4981st to 5000th cycles are shown in Fig. S17a and S17b,† respectively. The last 20 GCD plots illustrate poor changes when compared with the first 20 GCD plots, suggesting that the GW-YS-NFOHS electrode has good durability, which is excellently supported by the EIS data. To affirm the good durability of the YS-NFOHS electrode, the first 20 and last 20 GCDs of the YS-NFOHS electrode are shown in Fig. S18a and S18b.† A poor deviation is observed at the 5000th CD cycle related to the first CD cycle, revealing that the YS-NFOHS has satisfactory cyclability. Most importantly, the morphological characteristics of the GW-YS-NFOHS and YS-NFOHS electrodes do not change a lot after 5000 cycles (Fig. S19†). This further proves that the GW-YS-NFOHS and YS-NFOHS electrodes have satisfactory mechanical durability. We strongly believe that the exceptional electrochemical behavior of both GW-MSNGOHS positive and GW-YS-NFOHS negative electrodes can be generally ascribed to the following facts: (i) the GW-MSNGOHS and GW-YS-NFOHS with an exclusive porous nanoarchitecture can exhibit large SA and numerous exposed active sites, which has been validated by BET and FE-SEM observations. (ii) By interconnecting nanostructures, the branch channels are created, which are suitable for the fast charge–discharge features of the SCs. (iii) The graphene scaffold hampers metal ion degradation throughout the charge–discharge process, resulting in excellent cycle life.
3.6. Fabrication of the GW-MSNGOHS//GW-YS-NFOHS device
To further explore the practical aspects of the constructed electrodes, an asymmetric device (GW-MSNGOHS//GW-YS-NFOHS) is fabricated, in which the GW-MSNGOHS act as a positive electrode, the GW-YS-NFOHS act as a negative electrode, and KOH (6 M) serves as an electrolyte (Fig. 6a). Due to employing two battery-type electrodes (GW MSNGOHS and GW-YS-NFOHS), the appropriate potential window was obtained. As expected, the GW-MSNGOHS//GW-YS-NFOHS device exhibits a stable potential window up to 1.7 V (Fig. S20†). Besides, the CV plot of the GW-MSNGOHS//GW-YS-NFOHS device at various sweep rates (5 to 60 mV s−1) in a potential window of 0 to 1.7 V is shown in Fig. 6b. All of the plots comprise a couple of symmetrical peaks that are attributed to reversible redox kinetics that belonged to the storage mechanism mentioned above. There is no noticeable deviation in the curve shape, reflecting excellent rate capability as a result of the efficient electron/ion transfer kinetics on electrodes. GCD investigations were conducted for the GW-MSNGOHS//GW-YS-NFOHS device at diverse current densities (1 to 18 A g−1), and the observations are shown in Fig. 6c. As shown in Fig. 6c, all of the plots illustrated symmetric charge/discharge characteristics, indicating that the device has amazing coulombic efficiency. The existence of non-linear plots further proves that the capacity of the GW-MSNGOHS//GW-YS-NFOHS device originates from the faradaic behavior, which is in excellent agreement with CV data. The GW-MSNGOHS//GW-YSNFOHS device represents remarkable capacities of ≈140.2, 121.4, 104.6, 97.1 and 89.3 mA h g−1 at of 1, 3, 6, 9 and 18 A g−1, respectively. More impressively, the GW-MSNGOHS//GW-YS-NFOHS device has a capacity retention of ≈63.7% at 18 A g−1. It can be found that the capacities gradually diminished when the current density increased, which is due to the restricted contribution of the active material throughout faradaic reactions. For controlling and regulating the robustness of the MSNGOHS//GW-YS-NFOHS device for industrial applications, long-term cycling stability is necessary and crucial. Therefore, the assembled MSNGOHS//GW-YS-NFOHS device is subjected to cyclability behavior at 18 A g−1, and the observations are shown in Fig. 6e. In Fig. 6e, only 7.9% of capacity slump is observed after 10000 CD cycles. To confirm the exceptional cyclability of the MSNGOHS//GW-YS-NFOHS device, the first and last twenty-five CD cycles throughout the cycling behavior are shown in the inset of Fig. 6e. Fig. 6e shows slight changes in the last twenty-five CD cycles, further demonstrating the excellent cycling stability. Fig. 6f shows a Ragone plot of the MSNGOHS//GW-YS-NFOHS device. As depicted in Fig. 6f, the highest energy density of the GW-MSNGOHS//GW-YS-NFOHS device reaches up to 118.97 W h kg−1 at a power density of 1702 W kg−1, which is superior to those of formerly reported devices such as: MnO2/NiCo2O4//NC (46.2 W h kg−1 at 15.3 kW kg−1),50 Ni0.5Cu0.5Co2O4//AC (53.08 W h kg−1 at 700.3 W kg−1),51 H–CuO/GC//AC (36.8 W h kg−1 at 1.018 kW kg−1),52 NWs@NiCo2O4/NiO//AC (60 W h kg−1 at 1.16 kW kg−1),53 FeCo2O4/polypyrrole//AC (68.8 W h kg−1 at 800 W kg−1),54 and CoNi2S4//CNTs-Fe2O3-C (90.5 W h kg−1 at 1.84 kW kg−1).55 Furthermore, the MSNGOHS//GW-YS-NFOHS has about 63.16% of the energy density (75.14 W h kg−1) maintained at a high power density of 17000 W kg−1. To further approve of the potential applicability of the MSNGOHS//GW-YS-NFOHS device, the devices are connected to obtain a high voltage. After charging the devices, they can power a blue and green LED (inset in Fig. 6f).

4. Conclusions
Herein, we established an efficacious MOF-derived procedure to fabricate a high-performance graphene-wrapped yolk–shell NiFe2O4 hollow sphere (GW-YS-NFOHS) negative electrode material and a graphene wrapped multi-shelled NiGa2O4 hollow sphere (GW-MSNGOHS) positive electrode material with highly porous nanoarchitectures, which can be successfully employed as prospective positive and negative electrodes for the fabrication of supercapacitors in an asymmetric fashion. We found that both GW-YS-NFOHS and GW-MSNGOHS electrode materials provide rapid pathways for electron transfer and diminish the ion diffusion routes due to their exclusive nanostructures, which ultimately results in exceptional electrochemical properties. Owing to the exclusive structural characteristics of GW-YS-NFOHS and GW-MSNGOHS electrode materials, when examined these electrode materials for SC, the GW-MSNGOHS and GW-YS-NFOHS electrodes, reflected notable capacities (∼411.25 mA h g−1 and 254.25 mA h g−1, respectively) and excellent cyclability (98.9% and 90.9%, respectively). Most notably, an asymmetric device (GW-MSNGOHS//GW-YS-NFOHS) was assembled with the GW-MSNGOHS (positive electrode) and GW-YS-NFOHS (negative electrode) with a potential window of 1.7 V. The GW-MSNGOHS//GW-YS-NFOHS device exhibits remarkable electrochemical properties, particularly in terms of an excellent specific energy density of 118.97 W h kg−1 at 1702 W kg−1 and an exceptional robustness.
