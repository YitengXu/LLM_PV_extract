    , Accepted 6th December 2020First published on 7th December 2020AbstractIn this report we combine the catalytic properties of CeO2 nanoparticles with their transduction ability for photoelectrochemical sensing. This study highlights the usage of CeO2 providing catalytic activity towards H2O2, but only with a limited excitation range in the UV for the construction of a sensing system. In order to improve the photoelectrocatalysis of CeO2 nanoparticles by extending their excitation to visible light, Au/CeO2 core/shell hybrid nanoparticles have been synthesized. The hybrid nanoparticles are fixed on electrodes, allowing for the generation of photocurrents, the direction of which can be controlled by the electrode potential (without bias). The application of the hybrid nanoparticles results in an enhanced photocurrent amplitude under white light illumination as compared to the pure CeO2 nanoparticles. Wavelength-dependent measurements confirm the participation of the Au core in the signal transduction. This can be explained by improved charge carrier generation within the hybrid particles. Thus, by using a plasmonic element the photoelectochemical response of a catalytic nanoparticle (i.e. CeO2) has been spectrally extended. The effect can be exploited for sensorial hydrogen peroxide detection. Here higher photocatalytic current responses have been found for the hybrid particles fixed to gold electrodes although the catalytic reduction has been comparable for both types of nanoparticles. Thus, it can be demonstrated that Au/CeO2 core–shell nanoparticles allow the utilization of visible light for photoelectrochemical hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) detection with improved sensitivity under white light illumination or application of such particles with only visible light excitation, which is not possible for pure CeO2. With help of the layer-by-layer (LbL) technique for nanoparticle immobilization, the electrode response can be adjusted and with a 5 layers electrode a low detection limit of about 3 μM H2O2 with a linear detection range up to 2000 μM is obtained.
Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) platforms allow for a large variety of applications, such as solar cells, photocatalysis, water-splitting, and biochemical sensing.1–4 In the direction of sensing, first light-directed applications have been reported decades ago with light-addressable potentiometric sensors (LAPS) operating in the potentiometric mode.5–8 Recently, photocurrent measurements are coming more in the focus of research.9,10 The general principle of PEC sensors is based on the photoexcitation of a photoactive material, which is coupled to electron transfer reactions at the semiconductor-electrolyte interface.11–14 An electron transfer directed from the analyte to the illuminated electrode results in an anodic photocurrent signal, while the opposite direction triggers a cathodic signal.11,15 This allows for the creation of analytical signal chains starting from the analyte towards the transducing electrode. One advantage of such sensing systems is the potential for multiplexing. This has already been demonstrated for DNA,9 antibody–antigen interactions,16 or more recently for enzymatic substrates.17,18 In such systems different recognition elements are immobilized separated from each other on one PEC electrode and a locally positioned light beam is used for read-out. Different PEC detection principles have been demonstrated. (i) A direct charge-transfer – i.e. redox reactions at the semiconductor surface.19–22 (ii) The presence of enzymes close to the semiconductor electrode, whereby either enzymatic products or mediators are responsible for the charge transfer, or a direct electron transfer between the enzyme and the electrode takes place.23–29 (iii) Indirect detection of analytes by modifying the access of redox species to the electrode surface by binding events such as DNA–DNA, antibody–antigen, and lectin–carbohydrate reactions.9,10,30,31
Continuous optimization has led to the development of PEC platforms with advantages of low cost, low power, easy operation, wide detection range, fast response, and high sensitivity, compared with the most commonly used optical, electrochemical and mass-sensitive methods.10,12,32–34 Therefore, often semiconductor nanostructures such as nanoparticles (NPs) and nanowires (NWs) have been applied due to their unique physicochemical features such as high surface-to-volume ratio and high catalytic activity.35–37 Here different materials have been used such as CdSe, CdSe/ZnS, CdTe quantum dots (QDs),10,38,39 metal nanoclusters (NCs),20–22 carbon dots (CDs),40 InGaN/GaN nanowires (NWs),4 molybdenum disulphide (MoS2),41 and halide perovskites (HPs).42 Particularly, the utilization of NPs as photoactive component for PEC systems offers some advantages over bulk materials.24,35,36,43 For instance, by coating an electrode with semiconductor NPs, lateral resolution of local photocurrents can be improved in comparison to thick bulk semiconductor electrodes, as lateral diffusion of light-excited electron–hole pairs between NPs is hindered.17,44 However, often the photoactive NPs themselves provide no catalytic activity, and therefore the combination with a second type of catalytic NPs or biocatalysts is necessary to allow for light-triggered sensing.45,46 For catalytic NPs, the term nanozymes has been introduced, although a specific recognition comparable to enzymes is often not provided.47–49 However, nanozymes may help to overcome some inherent limitations of natural enzymes, such as high price, complicated immobilization processes, and instability issues regarding fluctuations in pH, temperature, and oxygen concentration.17,50 By mimicking different enzymes, nanozymes can be used to detect a variety of analytes including ions, small non-charged molecules (e.g. glucose), nucleic acids, and proteins.51–54 This suggests that integration of nanozymes to PEC systems would offer new routes for analyte detection.
CeO2 NPs have been used as nanozymes, exploiting the reversible oxidation state of cerium on the NP surface.55,56 They have been used as non-enzymatic catalysts to mimic properties of peroxidase,56 catalase,57 superoxide dismutase,58 and can thus, react with reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).59 On the other hand, semiconducting CeO2 NPs are also light-sensitive materials, thus allowing for the generation of photocurrents when coupled to electrodes.60–62 Therefore, CeO2 NPs are promising candidates for PEC sensors due to their photocatalytic features. However, the large band gap of CeO2 limits the usable excitation range to the UV,52 which can be harmful for biological analytes and prone for absorbance processes of molecules in solution as reported previously.4 It should also be mentioned that CeO2 has already been combined with other semiconductor materials such as MnO2,63 Cu2O64 or even polypyrrole65 in order to improve the catalytic properties for water splitting or even glucose detection.
In this study, we have developed a strategy to combine the catalytic properties of CeO2 with the PEC transduction ability. Hereby we expand the usable excitation range of CeO2 NPs to visible light by the synthesis of Au/CeO2 core/shell NPs. Thus, the hybrid NPs combine the photoelectrocatalytic activity of the CeO2 part with the surface plasmon excitation ability of the gold part, giving access to an overall improved PEC performance. This combination allows for the generation of photocurrents in the visible wavelength range and the creation of a sensitive signal chain for the detection of H2O2. An additional feature can be provided by the tunability of the photocurrent response by the electrode preparation using the layer-by-layer (LbL) technique.
Experimental section
NPs synthesis
Pure CeO2 NPs were obtained following minor modifications of a recently described protocol.66 Based on that, Au/CeO2 core/shell NPs were synthesized as follows: 100 mL of a citrate solution (10 mM) was added into a 150 mL three-necked round bottom flask. The solution was heated with a heating mantle under magnetic stirring and once boiling temperature was reached 1 mL of HAuCl4 (25 mM), and 4 mL of CeNO3 (25 mM) were sequentially injected. The resulting mixture was kept under reflux and stirring for 4 h. During the reaction, the color of the mixture changed from black (right after the precursor injection) to red (after ca. 10 min) and finally to purple (after ca. 4 h). The prepared NPs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and UV/VIS absorption spectroscopy (cf. Fig. SI-1–SI-5, ESI†) according to standard protocols.67 A full characterization is available in the manuscript in which the synthesis of these particles is described.66
Fabrication of working electrodes
Gold electrodes (Suzhou Research Materials Microtech Co. Ltd, China, chapter I of the ESI†) were processed by ultrasonic cleaning in acetone, water, and ethanol for 7 min each. After drying by N2, the electrodes were immersed in 0.1 M deoxygenated aqueous solution of cysteamine for 2 h in the dark, in order to prepare a positively charged layer on the gold electrode surface. The resulting cysteamine-modified electrodes were rinsed thoroughly with water and were afterwards soaked in water for 12 h, in order to remove only physically adsorbed cysteamine. After drying by N2, the electrodes were incubated in NP solutions for 24 h. Hereby, binding of the negatively charged NPs was forced by electrostatic interaction to the positively charged Au surface.68 Eventually, the electrodes comprising immobilized NPs were rinsed with water and were dried by N2. Optionally the electrodes could be modified with additional NP layers. For the creation of NP-multilayers, subsequent layers were assembled by first immersing the electrodes in poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) solution (PDDA, 10% in water) for 30 min (positively charged polymer).40 After thoroughly rinsing with water, this was followed by 24 h incubation in NP solution. The electrodes were rinsed again by water and dried by N2. For the addition of more layers, the PDDA and NP immobilization and washing steps were repeated.
Characterization of working electrodes by UV/VIS absorption measurements
Presence of the NPs on the working electrodes was quantified by recording UV/VIS absorption spectra on dried electrodes (Suzhou Research Materials Microtech Co. Ltd, China, chapter III of ESI†). Au electrodes modified only with the cysteamine layer were used as blank reference (cf. Fig. SI-9†).
Characterization of NP deposition by QCM measurements
Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) measurements were used for characterizing the immobilization of the NP layers. Data were recorded with a Q-Sense E4 analyzer (Q-Sense, Biolin Scientific). Standard AT-cut gold/quartz substrates were used with a fundamental frequency of f = 4.95 MHz ± 50 kHz (Q-Sense, AB, Göteborg, Sweden). Before adsorption of the NP layers, the substrates were cleaned thoroughly by 10 min immersion in fresh piranha solution (mixture of 30% H2O2 and 98% H2SO4, mixing proportion 1:3). This cleaning step was repeated 5 times. After that, the substrates were processed by cysteamine immobilization. With a constant flow rate of 25 μL min−1, the resonant frequency changes after addition of the different NP solutions were recorded (cf. Fig. SI-8†). The mass changes due to the immobilized NPs were calculated from the frequency changes by the Sauerbrey equation.69,70 Using the mass of single CeO2 and Au/CeO2 NPs (cf. chapter II of the ESI†) the amount of immobilized CeO2 and Au/CeO2 NPs could be estimated.
Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements
A homebuilt PEC system (cf. Fig. SI-12 and SI-13†) was used.17,28,39,45 White light (250–1100 nm) generated by a Xe-arc lamp was applied and its intensity was controlled by the power supply (LPS 220, Photon Technology International, USA). Based on that, filters were used to generate monochromatic light of different wavelengths. With the help of an optical chopper (Scitec instruments, USA), the applied illumination was modulated to 71 Hz. This was used as reference frequency for lock-in detection of the photocurrent for improving the signal to noise ratio (SNR).39 Electrochemical measurements were performed by a potentiostat (CH Instruments CHI600E, USA) with three electrodes: a NP-modified gold working electrode (WE), an Ag/AgCl (3 M NaCl) reference electrode (RE), and a Pt counter electrode (CE). The WE was sealed by an O-ring and put into a Teflon cell (cf. Fig. SI-14a†). The modulated illumination of the WE was switched on and off with a shutter. A bias potential U was applied to the WE and the resulting photocurrent was preamplified and then rectified by a lock-in amplifier and transferred to a personal computer (PC) via USB and serial ports, all controlled by a homebuilt software using LabVIEW (National Instruments, USA).
Hydrogen peroxide measurements
In both electrochemical and PEC measurements, before the measurement of each H2O2 concentration, the electrochemical cell including the CE, RE, and WE was thoroughly rinsed with water and dried by N2. Afterwards, the corresponding concentration of H2O2 in PBS was added into the electrochemical cell.
Results and discussion
Characterization of nanoparticles
Citrate-stabilized CeO2 NPs and Au/CeO2 NPs have been synthesized following a one-pot method recently reported.66 For a better comparison, both types of NPs are synthesized with a similar NP diameter, which is possible due to a well-defined synthesis technique.66,71,72 The morphology of the NPs has been explored by TEM, cf.Fig. 1. The CeO2 NPs exhibit a porous structure with a diameter of the inorganic core (i.e. without the organic surface capping of citric acid, which does not provide contrast in TEM) of dc = 14.5 ± 1.0 nm (cf.Fig. 1a). The Au/CeO2 hybrid NPs (cf.Fig. 1b) consist of an Au core with a diameter of dc = 5.7 ± 0.4 nm, which is surrounded by a porous, grainy, and inhomogeneous CeO2 shell, resulting in an overall diameter of the inorganic NPs of dc = 12.2 ± 0.4 nm. The TEM results are in line with DLS results in which the hydrodynamic diameter dh of the NP has been obtained in water. Mean hydrodynamic diameters as obtained from 3 measurements are dh = 20 nm and dh = 15 nm for the CeO2 NPs and Au/CeO2 core/shell NPs, respectively (cf. Fig. SI-6†). The presence of the Au cores in the Au/CeO2 core/shell NPs can also be verified by UV/VIS absorption spectroscopy in water (Fig. SI-5†). While the main absorption peak of CeO2 NPs is around λ = 270 nm (corresponding to an energy of E ≈ 4.6 eV; E = h·c/λ; h = Planck constant, c = speed of light), the Au/CeO2 NPs show an additional peak at about 540 nm (corresponding to an energy of ca. 2.3 eV), which can be assigned to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of the Au core.66,73 Furthermore, the hybrid particles have been analysed by X-ray diffraction demonstrating the composition from Au and CeO2 (see Fig. S3†). A more comprehensive material characterization can be found in a previous paper.66

Photoelectrochemical behaviour after nanoparticle immobilisation in a single layer arrangement
In order to select a proper immobilisation method, the charge of both NPs has been analysed via zeta potential measurements indicating a strong negative surface charge due to the use of citrate as surface ligand (Table SI-1, ESI†). Consequently, cysteamine as a short-chain and positively charged molecule has been chosen to coat the Au electrodes. Hence, the negatively-charged CeO2 NPs and Au/CeO2 core/shell NPs can be immobilized on the Au/cysteamine electrode via electrostatic attraction. The immobilization has been initially studied by QCM, which is a technique well suited to characterize deposition processes (Fig. SI-8, ESI†). It can be seen that for both types of NPs the frequency shifts immediately after addition of the NP solution and keeps relatively stable for a reasonable time, indicating the binding of the NPs to the Au surface. This not only demonstrates the successful deposition of both types of NPs on the electrode, but also allows for an estimation of the NP number based on the Sauerbrey relation.69 Data indicate that the Au electrodes are not fully covered with NPs. It should be noted here however, that these quantities have been obtained under flow conditions for a rather short time period and thus, cannot be transferred directly to the electrode preparation. Here much longer times without any solution flow have been used resulting in much better immobilization efficiencies. Thus, alternatively the electrode coverages have been determined from the absorption spectra given in Fig. SI-10 and SI-11.† These data, as recorded without flow, show much higher surface coverage and are thus more realistic to describe the scenario during PEC measurements. However, both methods demonstrate higher surface coverage of the Au electrodes with CeO2 than with Au/CeO2 NPs.
In order to prove functionality of the immobilized NPs on the modified gold electrodes, photocurrent measurements have been used. For this purpose the electrodes are excited with modulated light under variation of the applied bias potential U. Here, anodic (i.e. I > 0) as well as cathodic photocurrents (i.e. I < 0) can be generated (cf.Fig. 2).11 In case of the hybrid NPs, a much higher photocurrent has been observed under white light illumination. For example, the photocurrent detected at a bias of U = −500 mV vs. Ag/AgCl (i.e. U is the potential difference between the Au and the Ag/AgCl electrode) is about 20-fold higher for the hybrid Au/CeO2 NPs (−67.87 ± 0.18 nA) than for the pure CeO2 NPs (−3.13 ± 0.14 nA). Since even higher immobilization efficiencies have been observed for pure CeO2 NPs than for the hybrid NPs via QCM and UV/VIS analysis, the different photocurrent amplitudes cannot be explained by variations in the surface coverage, but may be mainly attributed to the different properties of the NPs, giving a first hint for the extended usable excitation range of the hybrid particles.
 Fig. 2  (a) Photocurrent traces I(t) as measured with gold electrodes modified with a single layer of either CeO2 NPs or Au/CeO2 NPs, recorded under white light illumination in 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4, under different bias voltage U. Note that here the rectified photocurrent, i.e. the signal shape after the lock-in amplifier is shown. Illumination is always started by moving a shutter. (b) The amplitudes of the photocurrents I(U) as recorded at the different bias potentials U, as extracted from (a). The active surface area of the electrode is Achip ≈ 0.28 cm2. Photocurrent densities can be calculated as j = I/Achip. For example, a photocurrent of 80 nA corresponds to a current density of ≈290 nA cm−2. Error bars indicate the standard deviation calculated from 3 electrodes. 
While the photocurrent magnitude depends on the type of NPs used, the potential behavior seems to be less affected. Photocurrents switch from a cathodic into an anodic direction at a potential of about U = 200 mV vs. Ag/AgCl, which is in good agreement with previous approaches using other semiconductor NPs based on CdSe/ZnS.26,74 Control experiments with plain Au/cysteamine electrodes without immobilized NPs verify that the photocurrent indeed originates from the immobilized NPs (Fig. SI-15, ESI†).
Photoelectrochemical behaviour of nanoparticle multilayers
To further enhance the PEC signal, the amount of NPs immobilized on the electrode has been increased by applying multiple NP layers by means of the LbL method.75 Hereby alternating layers of positively charged PDDA and negatively-charged NPs have been deposited (cf.Fig. 3a). The successful immobilisation of each NP layer has been controlled by UV/VIS absorption spectroscopy. The differential spectra of the electrodes after the deposition of each NP layer are shown in Fig. SI-10 and SI-11.† It can be seen that the added NPs within each layer from layer 1 to layer 5 (layer 1 is equal to the first single layer on Au/cysteamine) show quite similar magnitude of light absorption. In other words, the change of light absorption after each deposition round is rather linear for both types of NPs (cf.Fig. 3b). This points to a rather linear increase of the layer structure, and that the NP number in each layer is quite similar.

(b) Absorption A350 at 350 nm in dependence on the number of layers N of CeO2 and hybrid Au/CeO2 NPs. The data points are taken from absorption spectra A(λ) given in the ESI (Fig. SI-10 and SI-11†). (c) Dependencies of the photocurrents of gold electrodes with N deposited layers of CeO2 and Au/CeO2 NPs for two different electrode polarizations (U = −500 mV and +500 mV vs. Ag/AgCl, 0.01 M PBS pH 7.4, white light excitation). (d) Potential dependence I(U) of the photocurrent for Au electrodes with 5 layers of CeO2 and Au/CeO2 NPs, recorded in 0.01 M PBS under white light illumination. The time-dependent photocurrent measurements shown in Fig. 3c and d are given in the ESI, Fig. SI-18 and SI-19.† Error bars indicate the standard deviation calculated from 3 electrodes. 
The photocurrent behaviour of multilayers from pure CeO2 NPs and hybrid Au/CeO2 NPs are illustrated in Fig. 3c and d. It can be seen that the multilayers show an amplified photocurrent response as compared to a single layer arrangement for the NPs. The photocurrent detected for the CeO2 NPs at a bias of U = −500 mV vs. Ag/AgCl increases from −3.13 ± 0.14 nA for one layer up to −22.1 ± 0.2 nA for a 5 layer configuration, resulting in a 7-fold amplification. In the case of the hybrid Au/CeO2 NPs the photocurrents are enhanced 2.5-fold up to −173.97 ± 0.1 nA for the 5 layers system (at the same potential). Moreover, the photocurrent increases rather linear for both, anodic and cathodic directions with increasing number of layers (Fig. 3c). Multilayers exhibit the same potential behavior of the photocurrent as a single layer, but with higher values for the arrangements with the hybrid nanomaterial (Fig. 3d). Hence, despite the rather similar amount of deposited Au/CeO2 NPs in the layer arrangement, these systems always show far larger photocurrents than the pure CeO2 NPs. The multilayer system firmly verifies the beneficial effect of the usage of hybrid Au/CeO2 NPs in the PEC system.
Analysis of photocurrent generation
In the following the origin of the photocurrents will be discussed. For this purpose the correlation of photocurrent behaviour to the absorption properties of the NPs has been studied via a wavelength dependent measurement of the photocurrent (Fig. 4).26,76,77 For pure CeO2 NPs, at both U = −500 mV and +500 mV vs. Ag/AgCl, the photocurrent can only be observed in the UV range. Only here absorption takes place and corresponds to the large band gap of the CeO2 NPs, which in good agreement with findings of others78–80. In comparison, for the Au/CeO2 NPs an additional photocurrent in the visible range with a maximum at λ = 540 nm (corresponding to h·c/λ ≈ 2.3 eV) has been observed, which can be attributed to photoexcitation of the plasmonic Au core. Consequently, the photocurrent spectra correlate well with the absorbance properties of the hybrid NPs. In contrast, immobilisation of pure Au NPs (of comparable size as the gold part in the Au/CeO2 hybrid NPs, see Fig. SI-3†) yields only a negligible photocurrent (I = −0.26 nA at U = −500 mV vs. Ag/AgCl under white light illumination, cf.Fig. 6a), which demonstrates that both, the CeO2 and the Au part, are necessary for the generation of enhanced photocurrents. Au/CeO2 hybrid NPs are able to exploit white light excitation (which comprises only a minor UV part) resulting in higher PEC efficiency, due to the enlarged wavelength range. The same observation can be made for other bias voltages (cf. Fig. SI-17†). This is a clear advantage of the Au/CeO2 hybrid NPs over the pure CeO2 NPs. Subsequently, the usage of UV light for photocurrent generation as analytical signal can be avoided, which is of advantage as UV excitation may damage biological analytes and can impair with the absorbance features of molecules in solution.4

Optical filters have been used for generating different wavelengths from white light illumination. The details of the filters can be seen in ESI† (cf. chapter V). Error bars indicate the standard deviation calculated from 3 electrodes. Results for U = −300 V and U = +300 V are shown in Fig. SI-20.† 
Photoexcitation of plasmonic NPs can lead to increase in local temperature, which is referred to as photothermal heating.81 Such heating of gold NPs assembled in LbL films ultimately leads to rupture of the films, which can easily be seen as change in their morphology.82 In our work we have not observed such effect, as the loss of NPs would lead to a massive decrease in photocurrent. In addition, photothermal heating is most effective at the surface plasmon resonance frequency. However, upon photoexcitation with spectral discrimination (see Fig. 4) the photocurrent response followed the absorption spectrum of the Au/CeO2 hybrid NPs. Photothermal effects would have caused a deviation from this behavior at the surface plasmon resonance frequency.
In general, the interface between a semiconductor and a metal, which can be excited by light, is an interesting tool for PEC reactions and thus, first examples have already appeared in the literatures.83–87 In this study, we have made use of this interface in an arrangement of NPs on an Au electrode in order to build an analytical platform. The key is the Au/CeO2 interface, which allows for excitation not only in the UV, but also in the visible range. The excitation of surface plasmons in the Au cores generates hot electrons, which allows electron transfer reactions to take place, e.g. from the Au cores to the CeO2 shells.83,84,86–88 Consequently, charge carrier generation can be improved for the hybrid particles upon illumination. Furthermore, the photocurrent generation with visible light can be observed for both, anodic and cathodic photocurrents, which is in line with other findings in the literature, e.g. with TiO2/Au and Au/TiO2 structures with both directions of photocurrent.86
Photoelectrochemical hydrogen peroxide sensing
In order to demonstrate the sensing capacity of the here reported PEC system, H2O2 has been chosen as a model analyte due to the fact that CeO2 has a well-known peroxidase mimicking activity.89–91 Moreover, H2O2 is an interesting analyte by itself, e.g. for monitoring cellular activities, and due to the fact that a great number of oxidases produce H2O2 during the enzymatic conversion, which can be exploited for the construction of various enzymatic biosensors.
In order to understand the photoelectrochemical properties correctly we have first analyzed the catalytic activity of both nanoparticles without light illumination. Thus, the nanoparticles have been fixed on gold electrodes and subsequently studied voltammetrically in buffer with and without H2O2 (see Fig. SI-21†). Both particles, i.e. CeO2 NPs and Au/CeO2 NPs, show facilitated electrochemical H2O2 reduction under negative polarisation. The electrochemical response is rather comparable for both types of NPs. In addition, it has been found that Au NPs immobilized alone on an electrode do not facilitate H2O2 reduction (Fig. SI-16†). This means that the peroxidase-like activity can mainly be attributed to the CeO2 material and that the catalytic properties of the hybrid particles are mostly not altered by the introduction of the Au part.
In a second step the photoelectrochemical properties have been analysed for both particles fixed on electrodes. As can be seen from Fig. 5a and c, the photocurrent is dominantly cathodic, pointing to a facilitated reduction of H2O2. In contrast to the electrochemical reaction in the dark (without charge carrier generation inside the particles) the H2O2 signals exhibit a clear tendency to be higher for hybrid Au/CeO2 NPs than CeO2 NPs only (in Fig. 5a the photocurrent in presence of hydrogen peroxide is so small that it is hard to see in this scaling, whereas for the hybrid particles (Fig. 5c) it is already visible).

The transient results of Fig. 5b and d are shown in Fig. SI-22 and SI-23.†U and I refer to the applied potential and the collected rectified photocurrent, respectively. (e) The linear range of H2O2 detection using multilayers of CeO2 and Au/CeO2 NPs at U = −500 mV vs. Ag/AgCl. Error bars indicate the standard deviation calculated from 3 electrodes. 
It has to be mentioned that also anodic photocurrents have been observed for CeO2 NPs and Au/CeO2 NPs, but only at rather high concentrations (c(H2O2) > 10 mM) and potentials (>400 mV vs. Ag/AgCl). Thus, photocatalytic H2O2 oxidation is not a preferred reaction in this electrode system. For this reason, only the cathodic photocurrent response has been studied in more detail at a fixed electrode potential in the range from U = −100 to −500 mV vs. Ag/AgCl for five layers of hybrid Au/CeO2 NPs and CeO2 NPs electrodes. It can be seen that the PEC reduction of H2O2 is feasible with both types of NPs, but electrodes with Au/CeO2 NPs result in significantly higher signals. Whereas for CeO2 NPs at U = −100 mV vs. Ag/AgCl only a minor response can be seen, Au/CeO2 NPs exhibit already a clear photoresponse. Moreover, for both NPs the PEC response is further increased by lowering the working potential U. At a potential of U = −500 mV vs. Ag/AgCl the hybrid NPs give raise to an about 10-fold higher signal response as compared to the CeO2 NPs, indicating improved sensing properties of Au/CeO2 NPs under white light illumination.
The H2O2 response has been studied at different applied potentials of U = −100 mV, −300 mV, and −500 mV vs. Ag/AgCl (Fig. 5b and d). Whereas electrodes with hybrid NPs give clear signals for H2O2 detection already at a potential of −300 mV the CeO2 NPs can only be used at rather negative potentials of −500 mV vs. Ag/AgCl. The comparative analysis of both types of NPs clearly verifies that similar catalytic properties for hydrogen peroxide reduction can be exploited. The higher photocurrent for hybrid NPs – already found in pure buffer solution – is also obtained during the hydrogen peroxide detection experiments. Thus, it can be concluded that the improved light interaction is mainly responsible for higher analyte signals of Au/CeO2 NPs. The introduction of the gold part into the hybrid NPs improves the charge carrier generation upon illumination and thus, results in higher signals, which is advantageous for sensorial application.
Another important precondition for usage in analytical detection is the stability of the photocurrent response. Thus, this feature has been studied and the result is illustrated in Fig. SI-24† for repeated light pulses and verifies that this precondition for analytical application can be fulfilled. For the H2O2 detection a linear range can be observed from 50 μM to 1000 μM for five layers pure CeO2 NPs, and from 4 μM to 2000 μM for five layers of hybrid Au/CeO2 NPs (Fig. 5e). It has to be emphasized again that much higher photosignals are obtained in the whole concentration range tested for the hybrid NPs as compared to the plain CeO2 NPs.
As a consequence, a better signal-to-noise ratio and a smaller limit of detection (LOD) can be obtained for 5 layers of hybrid Au/CeO2 NPs (3 μM) compared to five layers of pure CeO2 NPs (27 μM). For a better classification of the results, the sensorial properties of the two NPs for the detection of H2O2 have been analysed with respect to the literature (cf. Table SI-4†).20,92–100 The sensing properties of the here reported PEC detection scheme are well comparable to other approaches and well suited to applications in H2O2 detection or enzyme substrate detection which are based on H2O2 generation.
For studying the selectivity of the PEC H2O2 sensor, successive measurements of ascorbic acid (AA), uric acid (UA), dopamine (DA), glucose, NaCl, and KCl have been performed with rather high concentrations in the millimolar range (Fig. SI-25†). Only minor changes occur from the other substances as compared to the signal of H2O2, which indicates a good selectivity. Furthermore, the stability of the signal generation in the absence and presence of H2O2 has been tested after several days of electrode storage (1–28 days) (Fig. SI-26 and SI-27†). Within the whole period of investigation only a few percent of signal change have been observed, which is important for future sensing applications.
Control experiments with nanoparticle mixtures
In order to make sure that the photocurrent and sensing effects are clearly attributed to close contact of the CeO2 and Au cores in the hybrid NPs, several control experiments have been performed. Here pure CeO2 and hybrid Au/CeO2 NPs are compared with mixtures of individual CeO2 and Au NPs in different ratios (Fig. 6a). As the catalytic activity of Au NPs depends on their size,101 the size of the Au NPs is here similar to the one of the Au part of the Au/CeO2 NPs. The characterisation of the Au NPs can be seen in the ESI, Fig. SI-3, SI-5c and SI-6c.†Fig. 6b and c illustrate the results of these experiments, which demonstrate that also mixtures of Au NPs with CeO2 NPs can be used for photocurrent generation and H2O2 detection. However, the photocurrent magnitude from the CeO2 NP/Au NP mixture in PBS buffer (without H2O2) is much smaller than the photocurrent of the hybrid NPs (Fig. 6b), though quantitative comparison is complicated as the precise NP concentrations on the electrodes are not known. In addition, when the response to H2O2 is analysed (Fig. 6c), the hybrid NPs lead to higher signals than the NP mixtures. This clearly demonstrates that the close contact between the plasmonic Au and the semiconducting CeO2, as present in the Au/CeO2 NPs, is essential for signal generation and photocatalytic response.102
 Fig. 6  (a) Mixtures of CeO2 NPs and Au NPs have been attached on top of Au electrodes, with a variable CeO2 percentage (i.e. the number of CeO2 NPs in relation to the total number of NPs: N(CeO2)/(N(CeO2) + N(Au))). The photocurrent I in dependence of the CeO2 percentage is shown, as recorded in 100 mM PBS buffer pH7.4 under white light illumination. (b) Photocurrent I in buffer and (c) signal change ΔI after addition of H2O2 of Au electrodes modified with CeO2 NPs, a mixture of CeO2 NPs, and Au NPs (CeO2-Au NPs, N(CeO2)/(N(CeO2) + N(Au)) = 40% mixing ratio), or hybrid Au/CeO2 NPs in a single or five layer arrangement at U = −500 mV vs. Ag/AgCl, 3 M NaCl in PBS. (c) Measurements as in (b), but after addition of 1 mM H2O2. The photocurrent change ΔI to the photocurrent without H2O2 as in (b) is shown. Error bars indicate the standard deviation calculated from 3 electrodes. 
Conclusions
In summary, a nanozyme-based PEC sensor has been designed using CeO2 NPs as nanoprobes without further biological decoration. Here the catalytic properties of the CeO2 material towards the reduction of hydrogen peroxide has been combined with the ability of photocurrent generation of electrode-fixed NPs. Focus of this study is the investigation of the photoelectrochemical properties of CeO2 NPs in comparison to hybrid Au/CeO2 core/shell NPs.
The photocurrent behavior from one layer of pure CeO2 NPs on a gold electrode can be significantly enhanced by the use of hybrid Au/CeO2 NPs. Under visible light, the photocurrent generation from hybrid NPs exploits the excitation of surface plasmons in the Au cores. By wavelength-dependent measurements, it is shown that photocurrent generation from hybrid Au/CeO2 core/shell NPs is even possible when only the Au core is excited, i.e. at a wavelength where the CeO2 part itself cannot be excited. This provides and verifies an additional pathway of photosignal generation under white light, which has been used in this study. It further means that UV excitation can be avoided for applications in which this may interfere. Synthesis of hybrid NPs thus helps to enable combined functionalities, such as the photocatalytic activity of CeO2, and the plasmonic properties of Au. Additionally, it has been found that the improved PEC response of the hybrid NP containing electrodes can be further exploited with respect to H2O2 sensing. Reductive photocurrent response is significantly higher as compared to the CeO2 NPs alone. Moreover, the PEC sensing performance can be enhanced by using multilayers of NPs, thus allowing the adjustment of the sensitivity by the number of layers applied in preparation and resulting in a sensitive detection system for H2O2.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  TEM images from (a) CeO2 and (b) Au/CeO2 NPs. The size distribution N(dc) histograms from the inorganic NP diameters dc are shown in (c). For additional TEM images we refer to Fig. SI-1 and SI-2.†	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Photocurrent traces I(t) as measured with gold electrodes modified with a single layer of either CeO2 NPs or Au/CeO2 NPs, recorded under white light illumination in 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4, under different bias voltage U. Note that here the rectified photocurrent, i.e. the signal shape after the lock-in amplifier is shown. Illumination is always started by moving a shutter. (b) The amplitudes of the photocurrents I(U) as recorded at the different bias potentials U, as extracted from (a). The active surface area of the electrode is Achip ≈ 0.28 cm2. Photocurrent densities can be calculated as j = I/Achip. For example, a photocurrent of 80 nA corresponds to a current density of ≈290 nA cm−2. Error bars indicate the standard deviation calculated from 3 electrodes.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Schematic diagram of the multilayer immobilization of NPs applying the layer-by-layer (LbL) technique (Au electrode/cysteamine/NPs/[PDDA/NPs]N−1) for N layers of CeO2 and Au/CeO2 NPs. (b) Absorption A350 at 350 nm in dependence on the number of layers N of CeO2 and hybrid Au/CeO2 NPs. The data points are taken from absorption spectra A(λ) given in the ESI (Fig. SI-10 and SI-11†). (c) Dependencies of the photocurrents of gold electrodes with N deposited layers of CeO2 and Au/CeO2 NPs for two different electrode polarizations (U = −500 mV and +500 mV vs. Ag/AgCl, 0.01 M PBS pH 7.4, white light excitation). (d) Potential dependence I(U) of the photocurrent for Au electrodes with 5 layers of CeO2 and Au/CeO2 NPs, recorded in 0.01 M PBS under white light illumination. The time-dependent photocurrent measurements shown in Fig. 3c and d are given in the ESI, Fig. SI-18 and SI-19.† Error bars indicate the standard deviation calculated from 3 electrodes.	 

 	Fig. 4  Wavelength dependency of the photocurrent I(λ) of Au electrodes with 5 layers CeO2 or 5 layers Au/CeO2 in 100 mM PBS buffer pH 7.4 at a bias voltage of (a) U = −500 mV and (b) U = +500 mV vs. Ag/AgCl, 3 M NaCl. Optical filters have been used for generating different wavelengths from white light illumination. The details of the filters can be seen in ESI† (cf. chapter V). Error bars indicate the standard deviation calculated from 3 electrodes. Results for U = −300 V and U = +300 V are shown in Fig. SI-20.†	 

 	Fig. 5  Chopped light voltammetry of gold electrodes modified with (a) 5 layers of CeO2 NPs and (c) 5 layers Au/CeO2 NPs under white light (scan rate: 5mV s−1, light pulses of 20 s, air saturated 100 mM PBS buffer pH 7.4). The H2O2 concentration c(H2O2) dependency of the photocurrent of a system with (b) 5 layers of CeO2 NPs and (d) 5 layers of Au/CeO2 NPs at different applied potentials U = −100 mV, −300 mV and −500 mV vs. Ag/AgCl under white illumination. The transient results of Fig. 5b and d are shown in Fig. SI-22 and SI-23.†U and I refer to the applied potential and the collected rectified photocurrent, respectively. (e) The linear range of H2O2 detection using multilayers of CeO2 and Au/CeO2 NPs at U = −500 mV vs. Ag/AgCl. Error bars indicate the standard deviation calculated from 3 electrodes.	 

 	Fig. 6  (a) Mixtures of CeO2 NPs and Au NPs have been attached on top of Au electrodes, with a variable CeO2 percentage (i.e. the number of CeO2 NPs in relation to the total number of NPs: N(CeO2)/(N(CeO2) + N(Au))). The photocurrent I in dependence of the CeO2 percentage is shown, as recorded in 100 mM PBS buffer pH7.4 under white light illumination. (b) Photocurrent I in buffer and (c) signal change ΔI after addition of H2O2 of Au electrodes modified with CeO2 NPs, a mixture of CeO2 NPs, and Au NPs (CeO2-Au NPs, N(CeO2)/(N(CeO2) + N(Au)) = 40% mixing ratio), or hybrid Au/CeO2 NPs in a single or five layer arrangement at U = −500 mV vs. Ag/AgCl, 3 M NaCl in PBS. (c) Measurements as in (b), but after addition of 1 mM H2O2. The photocurrent change ΔI to the photocurrent without H2O2 as in (b) is shown. Error bars indicate the standard deviation calculated from 3 electrodes.
