, Accepted 28th January 2015First published on 28th January 2015AbstractOne-dimensional (1D) CdS nanowire (NW)–two-dimensional (2D) BiVO4 nanosheet (NS) heterostructures (CdS–BiVO4 1D/2D HSs) have been fabricated toward visible-light driven selective fine-chemical synthesis in water under controlled reaction conditions. Good interfacial contact in the heterostructures is achieved through a simple and efficient electrostatic self-assembly synthetic methodology, which is afforded by the substantial attraction between two materials with opposite surface charge. These 1D/2D interfacial heterostructures are able to facilitate charge separation and transport between 1D CdS NWs and 2D BiVO4 NSs. Characterization results indicate that the markedly enhanced photocatalytic activity of CdS–BiVO4 1D/2D HSs is attributed to the introduction of 2D BiVO4 NSs, which serve as favourable receptors for efficient separation of photo-generated charge carriers excited from 1D CdS NWs. This work is expected to stimulate an increasing interest in coupling semiconductor photocatalysts with dissimilar dimensionalities for various applications in solar energy conversion.
1. Introduction
Solar-driven photocatalytic energy conversion and storage based on semiconductors have attracted growing interest as one of the most compelling objectives in modern chemistry.1–14 TiO2 is deemed to be a promising semiconductor photocatalyst for this purpose due to the advantages of non-toxicity, abundance, cost effectiveness, as well as high photo-stability.1,5,15–22 However, the large band gap (3.2 eV) of TiO2 makes it active only under UV light, limiting its practical application using solar light with more than 43% of visible light.23–29 Furthermore, the fast recombination of photo-generated charge carriers excited from TiO2 also shrinks the photocatalytic efficiency.30–36 These two factors are major bottlenecks that restrain the wide practical application of TiO2 photocatalysts. Accordingly, it is highly desirable to design novel photocatalysts that can well respond to visible light.8,12,23,37–44
Recent years have seen continuous attention in low-dimensional materials due to their unique properties resulting from the different ways that electrons behave in different confined dimensions.45–53 Among them, one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures such as nanowires, have garnered a flourish of interest in photocatalytic applications because of their unique geometrical characteristics in providing large aspect-ratio, direct pathways for charge transport, decoupling the direction of charge carrier collection, and low reflectance induced by light scattering and trapping.2,7,54–63 On the other hand, two-dimensional (2D) layered materials, have also demonstrated excellent properties owing to the confinement of electrons in their unique atomic layers.45,64–67 Furthermore, nano-sized 2D layered materials are excellent catalyst supports, which is beneficial for catalyst dispersion.68–71 Thus, the construction of 1D/2D heterostructures (HSs) might be able to integrate the respective advantages and mitigate the drawbacks of the single units, therefore producing new attributes that are different from the single components by engineering the electronic states over the interface between these two segments.72–75
Inspired by the progress in 1D nanostructures for solar energy conversion, and the growing interest of 2D layered materials in this field, we have chosen two typical visible-light driven photocatalysts, CdS7,54,76–80 and BiVO439,81–86 as building blocks for the construction of 1D CdS nanowires (NWs)–2D BiVO4 nanosheets (NSs) HSs (CdS–BiVO4 1D/2D HSs). Another important reason that we chose CdS and BiVO4 is because they, respectively, favor a hexagonal polymorph along the 1D direction and possess a 2D layered crystal structure. Characterization results suggest that the integrated heterostructures and dimensionality can increase the migration ability of photo-generated charge carriers over the CdS–BiVO4 1D/2D HSs under visible light irradiation, thereby leading to the obviously enhanced photocatalytic activity toward selective reduction of nitroaromatic compounds to amino aromatic compounds in water under visible light irradiation as compared to bare 1D CdS NWs and 2D BiVO4 NSs. This work is expected to stimulate an increasing interest in coupling semiconductor photocatalysts with dissimilar dimensionalities for various photocatalytic applications in solar energy conversion.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Chemicals
Chemicals were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China), including cadmium chloride (CdCl2·2.5H2O), sodium diethyldithiocarbamate trihydrate (C5H10NNaS2·3H2O), ethylenediamine (C2H8N2), bismuth(III) nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O), ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3), sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (C18H29NaO3S), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium persulfate (K2S2O8), ethanol (C2H6O), ammonium oxalate ((NH4)2C2O4·H2O), potassium ferricyanide (K3[Fe(CN)6]), potassium ferrocyanide (K4[Fe(CN)6]), potassium chloride (KCl), and N,N-dimethylflormamide (DMF). All materials were analytical grade and used as received without further purification. Deionized water used in the synthesis was obtained from local sources.
2.2. Catalyst preparation
(a) Preparation of 1D CdS nanowires. Uniform CdS NWs have been prepared by a solvothermal method.7,80 The typical experimental procedure is provided in the ESI.†
(b) Fabrication of 2D monoclinic BiVO4 nanosheets. The protocol of preparing monoclinic BiVO4 NSs is modified from the previously reported method.85 The details of the typical process are presented in the ESI.†
(c) Synthesis of CdS–BiVO4 1D/2D HSs. The fabrication process of CdS–BiVO4 1D/2D HSs via a nanoscale self-assembly methodology is depicted in Scheme S3 (ESI†). In a typical synthesis, the positively charged 1D CdS NWs (0.2 g) were first dispersed in 100 mL deionized water by sonication for 30 min. Then, a certain amount of negatively charged BiVO4 NSs suspension was added into the positively charged CdS NWs dispersion under vigorous stirring. After stirring for 30 min, the yellow precipitates were collected and washed with deionized water, then dried in an oven at 333 K. The addition weight amounts of BiVO4 NSs in the CdS–BiVO4 1D/2D HSs were controlled to be 0.5, 1, 2, 10 and 25 wt%, respectively.
2.3. Characterization
Zeta potentials (ξ) of the CdS NWs and BiVO4 NSs were determined by dynamic light-scattering analysis (Malvern Zetasizer Nano-ZS90) at a room temperature of 298 K. The crystal phase properties of the samples were analyzed with a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (XRD) using Ni filtered Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. The optical properties of the samples were characterized by UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Cary 500, Varian Co.), during which BaSO4 was employed as the internal reflectance standard. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) was used to determine the morphology of the samples on an FEI Nova NANOSEM 230 spectrophotometer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images were obtained using a JEOL model JEM 2010 EX instrument at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Micromeritics ASAP2020 equipment was used to determine the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas at 77 K. The sample was degassed at 413 K for 5 h and then analyzed at 77 K. The relative pressure (P/P0) range used for calculation of BET surface area was from 0.05 to 0.35. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra for solid samples were investigated on an Edinburgh FL/FS900 spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 380 nm. The electrochemical analysis was carried out in a conventional three-electrode cell using a Pt plate and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The working electrode was prepared on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass that was cleaned by sonication in ethanol for 30 min and dried at 353 K. The boundary of FTO glass was protected using the scotch tape. The 5.0 mg sample was dispersed in 1.0 mL of DMF by sonication to get slurry. Then, 15 μL of slurry was spread onto the pretreated FTO glass. After air drying, the working electrode was further dried at 393 K for 2 h to improve adhesion. Then, the scotch tape was unstuck, and the uncoated part of the electrode was isolated with epoxy resin. The exposed area of the working electrode was 0.25 cm2. The photocurrent measurements were performed in a homemade three-electrode quartz cell with a PAR VMP3Multi Potentiostat apparatus. The electrolyte was 0.2 M aqueous Na2SO4 solution (pH = 6.8) without additive. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments and cyclic voltammograms were conducted on a CHI 660D workstation (CH Instrument) in the electrolyte of 0.5 M KCl aqueous solution containing 0.01 M K3[Fe(CN)6]/K4[Fe(CN)6] (1:1) under open circuit potential conditions.
2.4. Photocatalytic activity
In a typical photocatalytic reaction, a 300 W Xe arc lamp (PLS-SXE 300, Beijing Perfect Light Co., Ltd.) with a UV-CUT filter to cut off light with a wavelength λ < 420 nm was used as the irradiation source. A 6 mg portion of the sample and 30 mg ammonium oxalate as hole scavenger were added into 30 mL of the nitroaromatic compounds solution (10 mg L−1) in a quartz vial with N2 bubbling at the flow rate of 80 mL min−1. Before irradiation, the solution was stirred in the dark for 1 h to ensure the adsorption–desorption equilibrium between the sample and reactant. During the process of the reaction, 3 mL of sample solution was collected at a certain time interval and centrifuged to remove the catalyst completely at 12000 rmp. Afterward, the solution was analyzed on a Varian ultraviolet-visible light (UV-vis) spectrophotometer (Cary-50, Varian Co.). The photograph of the experimental setup is displayed in the Fig. S1 (ESI†).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structure and morphology of CdS–BiVO4 1D/2D HSs
The crystallographic structure of CdS NWs, BiVO4 NSs and CdS–BiVO4 1D/2D HSs is confirmed by the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. As shown in Fig. 1, the XRD pattern of CdS NWs can be ascribed to the hexagonal phase of CdS (JCPDS no. 41-1049) while BiVO4 NSs can be attributed to the monoclinic BiVO4 (JCPDS no. 14-0688). For CdS–BiVO4 1D/2D HSs, both of diffraction peaks of CdS NWs and BiVO4 NSs are appeared. It is notable that while introducing a small amount of BiVO4 NSs into CdS NWs, such as in CdS–0.5% BiVO4 1D/2D HSs, the diffraction peaks of BiVO4 NSs cannot be clearly detected. As the ratio of BiVO4 NSs increased, the intensities of BiVO4 NSs diffraction peaks become stronger while those of CdS NWs being weaker. It is in accordance with the variation of the relative contents over two segments in CdS–BiVO4 1D/2D HSs.

The good interfacial contact between CdS NWs and BiVO4 NSs is accomplished by the electrostatic self-assembly process of CdS NWs with BiVO4 NSs, which can be demonstrated by the zeta potential (ξ) measurements. It is shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†) that CdS NWs exhibit a zeta potential value of +11.5 mV, while BiVO4 NSs aqueous dispersion display obvious negatively charged surface with a zeta potential value of −24.0 mV. With adding negatively charged BiVO4 NSs into positively charged CdS NWs aqueous solution, well-contacted CdS–BiVO4 1D/2D HSs have been fabricated by an electrostatic attraction, i.e. electrostatic self-assembly approach. The 1D/2D morphology with good interfacial contact of CdS–BiVO4 1D/2D HSs is clearly revealed by FE-SEM images. As shown in Fig. 2A, the blank CdS NWs feature highly uniform 1D morphology with mean diameter distribution of ca. 50–100 nm, while the BiVO4 sample possesses a well-defined nanosheets layer structure as shown in Fig. 2B. When coupling CdS NWs with BiVO4 NSs, 1D CdS NWs have been deposited onto the 2D BiVO4 NSs surfaces, giving rise to the heterostructures of CdS–BiVO4 1D/2D HSs (Fig. 2C).

To further investigate the microscopic structure information of the samples, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis has been carried out. As displayed in Fig. 3, the 1D nanostructures of CdS NWs (Fig. 3A) and 2D layer structure of BiVO4 NSs (Fig. 3B) are observed. As shown in Fig. 3C, the morphology of CdS–BiVO4 1D/2D HSs indicates that the 1D CdS NWs have been deposited onto the BiVO4 sheets surface, which is further revealed by the low- and high-magnification TEM images (Fig. 3D). In Fig. 3D, the observed lattice fringes of 0.316 nm and 0.309 nm correspond to the (101) facet of CdS and the (21) crystal plane of monoclinic BiVO4 (m-BiVO4), respectively. Distinct borderlines between isolated units of CdS and BiVO4 are observed, suggesting that CdS NWs are successfully combined with BiVO4 NSs, thus forming the binary heterostructures. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of CdS NW (Fig. 3E) confirms that it is a single crystal, and the pattern is indexed to the reflection of hexagonal CdS crystals along the c axis.87 SAED pattern in Fig. 3F is matched well to the single-crystalline structure of m-BiVO4,85 clearly indicating that each BiVO4 NSs is composed of m-BiVO4 single crystals. The joint SEM and TEM characterization suggests a good interfacial contact formed between the 1D CdS NWs and the 2D BiVO4 NSs, which originates from the electrostatic attractive interaction between positively charged CdS NWs and negatively charged BiVO4 NSs. It is widely recognized that the intimate interfacial contact between different components in nanocomposites is a key factor for effectively depressing the recombination of the photo-generated electron–hole pairs, thereby leading to high photo-conversion efficiency.54,87–89

3.2. Optical properties of CdS–BiVO4 1D/2D HSs
Ultraviolet-visible light diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) are employed to study the optical properties of the samples. As displayed in Fig. 4, all of the samples exhibit the pronounced adsorption bands in the visible light region spanning from 500 to 750 nm. Absorption intensities of a series of CdS–BiVO4 1D/2D HSs do not show obvious enhancement as compared to blank CdS NWs and BiVO4 NSs, while the absorption band edge of heterostructures are between CdS NWs and BiVO4 NSs. The results indicate that the formation of 1D/2D HSs plays an inconspicuous influence on the optical properties of CdS–BiVO4 1D/2D HSs.

3.3. Photocatalytic activity of CdS–BiVO4 1D/2D HSs
To evaluate the photocatalytic performance of the CdS–BiVO4 1D/2D HSs, a typical photocatalytic fine-chemical synthesis process, anaerobic reduction of nitro compound 4-nitroaniline (4-NA), is employed as the probe reaction. The conversion of the 4-NA to p-phenylenediamine (PPD) is detected by the ultraviolet-visible light adsorption spectra, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). It indicates that there are only two principal species, 4-NA and PPD, during the reduction process. Fig. 5 shows the photocatalytic activity of blank CdS NWs, BiVO4 NSs and a series of CdS–BiVO4 1D/2D HSs toward photocatalytic selective reduction of 4-NA in the aqueous phase under visible light irradiation. It is clear that CdS–BiVO4 1D/2D HSs exhibit significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity as compared to blank CdS NWs and BiVO4 NSs. In particular, CdS–1% BiVO4 1D/2D HSs show the best photocatalytic activity, which indicates that an optimum synergistic interaction between 1D CdS and 2D BiVO4 is required for achieving the highest photocatalytic activity. Nevertheless, further increasing the weight addition ratio of BiVO4 NSs leads to a deterioration of the activity. Notably, BiVO4 NSs alone do not show photocatalytic activity toward conversion of 4-NA. It is due to the low conduction band (CB) position of BiVO4 NSs, which could not drive the reduction of nitro compounds.39,90–92 Such a significant improvement of activity over CdS–1% BiVO4 1D/2D HSs, as compared to blank CdS NWs and BiVO4 NSs, has also been observed for photo-reduction of a variety of other substituted nitroaromatic compounds, thus suggesting that CdS–BiVO4 1D/2D HSs are able to perform as an efficient visible-light-driven photocatalyst for this typical fine-chemical synthesis process (Fig. 6).

Compared to the photocatalytic activity, the stability of a photocatalyst is also of great importance for its application in sustainable reuse. Therefore, recycling photoactivity experiments are also conducted to investigate the photo-stability of the as-prepared samples. As shown in Fig. 7, there is no obvious activity drop after six successive recycles, which indicates that the CdS–1% BiVO4 1D/2D HSs photocatalyst is stable during the present reaction conditions. XRD patterns (Fig. S4, ESI†) of the fresh and used samples reveal an intact crystalline structure of CdS–1% BiVO4 1D/2D HSs after recycling photocatalytic reactions. In our photocatalytic systems, photo-generated holes are efficiently quenched by the addition of ammonium oxalate, which thus prevents the photo-corrosion of CdS NWs during the photocatalytic reaction.7,54 Besides, the formation of CdS–BiVO4 heterostructures could also prevent the photo-corrosion of CdS to a certain extent which has been also reported in the previous work.93 Clearly then, both the proper control of reaction conditions and effective coupling of semiconductors could enhance the photo-stability of CdS–BiVO4 1D/2D HSs in the photocatalytic systems.

3.4. Origin of the enhanced photocatalytic activity of CdS–BiVO4 1D/2D HSs
To disclose the origin accounting for the significantly enhanced activity of CdS–BiVO4 1D/2D HSs for photocatalytic reduction of nitro compounds under visible light, we have then comparatively characterized the optimal sample of CdS–1% BiVO4 1D/2D HSs, bare 1D CdS NWs and 2D BiVO4 NSs. The photoelectrochemical analysis is able to reflect the fate and transfer of photo-generated charge carriers, which are the key factors determining the overall photoactivity associated with semiconductor-based materials in principle.7,40,54 As demonstrated in Fig. 8A, it is clear that CdS–1% BiVO4 1D/2D HSs electrode displays the remarkably enhanced transient photocurrent as compared to blank CdS NWs and BiVO4 NSs under visible light irradiation, respectively, which indicates more efficient separation of photoexcited electron–hole pairs. Notably, the photocurrent of single BiVO4 sheets is “flattened” due to its low photocurrent intensity as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). It is established that the charge-carrier transfer between different parts of composites usually results in the weakening of photoluminescence (PL) intensity.57,65,82 As shown in Fig. 8B, under an excitation of 380 nm, the PL intensity of CdS–1% BiVO4 1D/2D HSs is lower than that of blank 1D CdS NWs, suggesting that the recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes is efficiently suppressed in the CdS–BiVO4 1D/2D HSs. Notably, the PL profile of CdS–BiVO4 1D/2D HSs is obviously different from blank 2D BiVO4, suggesting that the formed 1D/2D heterostructure significantly affects the PL emission of BiVO4 in the composite. Because of the relatively rather low amount of BiVO4, we can conclude that the PL emission peak feature for CdS–1% BiVO4 1D/2D HSs is mainly attributed to that of CdS nanowires. To further investigate the efficient charge transport in the CdS–1% BiVO4 1D/2D HSs, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) presented as Nyquist plots are performed for the working electrodes of CdS NWs, BiVO4 NSs and CdS–1% BiVO4 1D/2D HSs. As shown in Fig. 8C, the Nyquist plot of CdS–1% BiVO4 1D/2D HSs electrode exhibits a most depressed semicircle at high frequency, manifesting that the more efficient transfer of charge carriers is obtained over CdS–1% BiVO4 1D/2D HSs as compared to bare 1D CdS NWs and 2D BiVO4 NSs.9,43,82 The cyclic voltammograms (CV) curves of the samples are presented in Fig. 8D. CdS–1% BiVO4 1D/2D HSs electrode displays a higher anodic current density than that of bare CdS NWs and BiVO4 NSs, demonstrating an enhanced electron transfer rate due to the coupling of CdS NWs and BiVO4 NSs.8,64 All the above results demonstrate that the significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity of CdS–BiVO4 1D/2D HSs is originated from the coupling of CdS with BiVO4 for the formation of 1D/2D heterostructures, thus leading to the prolonged lifetime of photo-generated charge carriers. On one hand, due to the suitable band energy levels (Scheme 1 as discussed later), the introduction of BiVO4 NSs is able to further boost the transfer of charge carriers in the heterostructures. On the other hand, the 1D/2D interface states offer a few charge carrier transport channels between the 1D CdS NWs and the 2D BiVO4 NSs.73

Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms (Fig. S6, ESI†) for these three samples are given for measuring the surface area and porosity of the samples. As revealed in Table S1 (ESI†), the specific BET surface areas (SBET) are 20.59, 9.13 and 18.28 m2 g−1, for bare CdS NWs, BiVO4 NSs and CdS–1% BiVO4 1D/2D HSs, respectively. In addition, it is clearly seen that the total pore volume and porosity of CdS–1% BiVO4 1D/2D HSs and blank CdS NWs are almost the same. The results suggest that the distinct improvement of photocatalytic activity of CdS–1% BiVO4 1D/2D HSs as compared to CdS NWs and BiVO4 NSs should not result from the surface area and porosity difference.
3.5. Photocatalytic mechanism of CdS–BiVO4 1D/2D HSs
To explore the influence of reaction conditions on the photocatalytic selective reduction of nitro organics to corresponding amino organics, control experiments have been performed. Blank experiments (without catalyst or light) under identical conditions demonstrate negligible photoactivities, as shown in Fig. 9b and c, suggesting the reaction is truly driven by a photocatalytic process. The conversion of 4-NA over CdS–1% BiVO4 1D/2D HSs is greatly inhibited in the absence of ammonium oxalate (Fig. 9d), indicating that the oxidation reaction which is driven by photo-generated holes is a competitive reaction with the photo-reduction reaction. Thus, the addition of hole scavenger is of great significance to effective photocatalytic reduction of 4-NA over CdS–BiVO4 1D/2D HSs. Fig. 9e shows the inhibited activity in the absence of N2, which suggests that the inert anaerobic atmosphere is also important for the photocatalytic reduction systems. To directly understand the role of photo-generated electrons for reduction of nitro compounds, a radical scavenger K2S2O8 for photo-generated electrons is added into the reaction system, which shows almost no conversion, as displayed in Fig. 9f. The results demonstrate that photo-generated electrons and proper control of reaction parameters integratively play a decisive role in driving the photocatalytic reduction of nitroaromatics in an effective manner.
 Fig. 9  Control experiments for photocatalytic reduction of 4-NA over CdS–1% BiVO4 1D/2D HSs under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm), the reaction with the addition of ammonium oxalate in a N2 atmosphere (a), reaction without photocatalyst (b), without irradiation (c), in the absence of ammonium oxalate (d), reaction without the purge of N2 (e), reaction with K2S2O8 as a scavenger for electrons (f). 
Due to the low conduction band (CB) position of BiVO4 NSs, which could not drive the reduction of nitro compounds, traditional charge transfer mechanism is unsuitable in our photocatalytic system.39,92 Therefore, a novel Z-scheme reaction mechanism over CdS–BiVO4 1D/2D HSs is proposed as follows, which is illustrated in Scheme 1. Under the visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm), electrons are excited from the valence bands (VB) to the CB on 1D CdS NWs and 2D BiVO4 NSs, respectively, while the photo-generated holes in the VB are created. The photo-generated electrons in the CB of BiVO4 move to the VB of the CdS, and then recombine with photo-generated holes at the CdS, completing the relay of the “Z-scheme”, similar to that of natural photosynthesis that results in the holes in the VB of BiVO4 nanosheets with a strong oxidation power and the electrons in the CB of CdS NWs with a strong reduction power.94–96 The photo-generated electrons in CdS NWs migrate to the surface and lead to the reduction of nitroaromatic compounds. Meanwhile, photo-generated holes in the VB are trapped by the hole quencher of ammonium oxalate in a N2 atmosphere, which restrains the oxidation process for nitroaromatics and thus guarantees that selective photoreduction proceeds efficiently.
4. Conclusion
In summary, the CdS–BiVO4 1D/2D HSs have been fabricated via a simple electrostatic self-assembly synthetic methodology for the first time. As compared to bare 1D CdS NWs and 2D BiVO4 NSs, the CdS–BiVO4 1D/2D HSs display significantly improved photocatalytic activity toward selective reduction of nitroaromatic compounds to corresponding amino aromatic compounds under visible light irradiation. It is revealed that the coupled semiconductors with suitable band gap and different dimensions could induce an increased migration ability of photo-generated charge carriers over CdS–BiVO4 1D/2D HS, which contributes to the significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity. It is hoped that the specific 1D/2D heterostructures offer a promising strategy for designing semiconductor-based composite photocatalysts with dissimilar dimensionalities toward improved photocatalytic activity.
