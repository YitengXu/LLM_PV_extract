    , Accepted 17th April 2014First published on 24th April 2014AbstractBecause of the potential for application in photoelectrochemical cells for water splitting, the synthesis of nanostructured BiVO4 is receiving increasing attention. Here we report a simple new drop-casting method for the first time to synthesize un-doped and doped bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) nanoflake array films. Synthesis parameters such as the amount of polyethylene glycol 600 (PEG-600) and the precursor solution drying time are investigated to optimize the films for photoelectrochemical water oxidation. The BiVO4 films consisting of nanoflakes with an average thickness of 20 nm and length of 2 μm were synthesized from a precursor solution containing Bi3+, V3+ and PEG-600 with a Bi:V: PEG-600 volume ratio of 2:2:1, dried at 135 °C for 55 min. Photoelectrochemical measurements show that the BiVO4 nanoflake array films have higher photoelectrochemical activity than the BiVO4 nanoparticle films. Additionally, the nanoflake arrays were tested after incorporating W and Mo to enhance the photoelectrochemical activity. The 2% W, 6% Mo co-doped BiVO4 nanoflake array films demonstrate the best photoelectrochemical activity with photocurrent densities about 2 times higher than the un-doped BiVO4 nanoflake films and greater than the photocurrents of individually Mo doped or W doped BiVO4 films. The origin of enhanced photoelectrochemical activity for the co-doped film may be due to the improved conductivity through the BiVO4 or slightly enhanced water oxidation kinetics.
1. Introduction
Synthesis of semiconductor nanostructure array films has attracted considerable attention over the past decade, both because of their unique electronic and optical properties, and potential application in photovoltaic or photoelectrochemical devices, such as dye-sensitized solar cells and solar water splitting cells.1–7 In comparison to bulk semiconductor materials, nanostructured array films can offer direct pathways for carrier transport as well as a large semiconductor–electrolyte interface,3,8,9 which may improve the performance of photoelectrochemical devices such as photoanodes for water oxidation. In recent years, many photoanodes have been synthesized in nanostructured geometries, such as nanotube,7,10 nanorod11,12 and nanowire13 arrays. In many instances these nanostructured arrays have shown enhanced efficiency for photoelectrochemical water oxidation.
Monoclinic bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) has been considered a promising material for photoelectrochemical water oxidation due to its moderate bandgap (∼2.4 eV) and appropriate band edge positions,14,15 allowing it to absorb as much as 11% of the solar spectrum to drive the water splitting reactions. Assuming a quantum yield of 100% in BiVO4, photocurrents of ∼7.5 mA cm−2 could be achieved under AM 1.5G illumination.16 However, the best performing films developed to date fall well short of this value. The major limiting factors identified include low mobility of carriers, slow water oxidation kinetics, and high electron–hole recombination rates compared to other semiconductors of interest such as TiO2 and WO3.17–20 To address these issues, several strategies have been developed to improve the photoelectrochemical activity of BiVO4, such as doping with foreign elements (Mo, W),21–24 hydrogen reduction to create oxygen vacancies,25 coupling with co-catalysts (FeOOH, Co–Pi)17,18,26,27 or other semiconductors to form stable heterojunction photoanodes.28,29 Another strategy is synthesizing BiVO4 as nanostructured films, in which the photogenerated holes can traverse a shorter distance to be collected at the electrode/solution interface, and thus the holes have a lower chance of recombining with the electrons before participating in electrochemical reactions. Nevertheless, there are only a few reports that describe synthesis of BiVO4 nanostructured array films up to now,5 and the reported synthetic method relies on relatively complicated procedures and conditions, which implies high cost and low-suitability for implementation on a large scale. We were inspired by work using structure-directing agents with other metal oxides such as ZnO30 and WO3,31,32 to synthesize nanostructured films of BiVO4 using low-cost and scalable techniques.
Herein, we report a new, simple, and cost-effective drop-casting method for synthesizing BiVO4 and Mo and W doped BiVO4 nanoflake array films on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates. This synthesis technique allows for easy control of both the morphology and chemical composition to improve the photoelectrochemical activity of BiVO4 films. Films ranging in morphology from nanoflake arrays to agglomerated nanoparticles were tested to evaluate their performance as photoanodes. The BiVO4 nanoflake array films showed better photoelectrochemical activity than BiVO4 nanoparticle films. Furthermore, incorporation of 2% W and 6% Mo into the BiVO4 nanoflake array films resulted in higher photoelectrochemical activity compared to the un-doped BiVO4 films.
2. Experimental
2.1 Material synthesis
Bi(NO3)3·xH2O (Alfa Aesar, 99.999%), VCl3 (Sigma-Aldrich, 97%), (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.98%) and (NH4)10W12O41·5H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.99%) were dissolved separately at a concentration of 75 mM in ethylene glycol (Fischer, 99+%) as metal precursor solutions. 0.85 g polyethylene glycol 600 (PEG-600, Alfa Aesar) was dissolved in 25 mL ethylene glycol to create the structure directing agent solution. The precursor solutions were mixed in the desired Bi:V:W:Mo atomic ratios with PEG-600 solution. Based on the best doping levels from previous work,22 the Bi:V:W:Mo atomic ratios of the films are as follows: 50:50:0:0 for BiVO4, 48.75:48.75:2.5:0 for 2.5% W doped BiVO4, 47.5:47.5:0:5 for 5% Mo doped BiVO4 and 46:46:2:6 for 2% W, 6% Mo co-doped BiVO4. The typical experimental procedure for synthesizing BiVO4 nanoflake array films is as follows: 500 μL Bi(NO3)3 solution, 500 μL VCl3 solution and 250 μL PEG-600 solution were mixed to form a precursor solution that is green in color. Next, 200 μL of precursor solution was drop-cast on FTO coated glass substrates (1.5 × 1.5 cm, Pilkington, TEC15) that had been cleaned and sonicated with ethanol (Fischer, 99+%). The sample was dried in an oven at 135 °C for 55 min and then annealed in air at 500 °C for 2.5 hours, a yellow/orange film was obtained on the FTO substrates. For comparison, different morphologies of BiVO4 films were synthesized via adjusting the synthesis conditions, such as the concentration of PEG-600, and drying time for the precursor solution. All films had the same mass of active material, so that the effects of morphology could be observed.
2.2 Material characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were acquired using a Zeiss Supra 40 VP SEM. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were taken on a Rigaku Spider X-ray diffractometer using powder samples. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD system with monochromated Al-Kα radiation. UV-vis transmission measurements were performed with a Cary 5000 UV-vis spectrometer. For Tauc plots the absorption coefficient (α) was determined by: α = −ln(10−absorbance)/z(1)where z is the film thickness.
2.3 Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements
The electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements were conducted using a three-electrode cell, which had a main compartment for the working electrode and two branched compartments separated by fritted disks (Ace Glass, 10–20 μm porosity) for the counter electrode and reference electrode. The working electrode was a BiVO4 film which was pressed against an O-ring on the main compartment. It had a backside mask so that the active area was approximately 0.22 cm2 for both frontside and backside illumination measurements. The counter electrode was a 1 mm diameter Pt wire (99.95%, Alfa Aesar) and the reference electrode was Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl, CH Instruments, CH111). Each compartment of the cell was filled from the same stock of electrolyte solution. The pH of the solution was checked using a bench top pH meter (OAKTON). A CH Instruments 660D electrochemical workstation was employed for the electrochemical measurements.
The illumination source was a 150 W xenon lamp (Newport, Model 9600) with an AM 1.5G filter (Newport). For light measurements the lamp was positioned to provide approximately 100 mW cm−2 irradiation on the film as measured by a thermopile detector (Newport, Models 1916C and 818-P). In the present work, the photoelectrochemical measurements for the films are conducted using back-side illumination (through the FTO-glass substrate to film). IPCE measurements were conducted using a full solar simulator (Newport, Model 9600, 150 W xenon lamp) with an AM 1.5 filter and a motorized monochromator (Oriel Cornerstone 130 1/8 m). The monochromator slit size was adjusted to 0.75 mm × 12 mm providing monochromatic wavelengths and a power density which ranged from 12.8 to 252.3 μW cm−2 of irradiation for wavelengths between 340 and 520 nm. A typical light power density used for the IPCE measurements can be found in Fig. S8.† Light power was measured using a handheld optical power meter with a UV enhanced silicon photo-detector (Newport, Models 1916C and 818-UV). The IPCE is expressed by following equation: IPCE = (1240 × I)/(λ × Plight)(2)where I is the measured photocurrent density at a specific wavelength (mA cm−2), λ is the wavelength of incident light (nm) and Plight is the measured light power density at that wavelength (mW cm−2) .
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed using a CH Instruments 660D in 0.2 M Na2SO4 solution and 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.6). The Nyquist plots were measured at 0.8 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) with an AC amplitude of 5 mV and frequency of 100 kHz–100 mHz under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). The measured spectra were fitted with Zview. For converting the potential vs. Ag/AgCl to RHE the following equation was used: ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 pH + 0.197 V(3)
Mott–Schottky measurements were conducted using a CH Instruments 660D and the built in software was used to measure capacitance vs. applied potential at a fixed frequency. Mott–Schottky plots were created and fit to ideal semiconductor behavior: 1/C2 = (2/eεε0Nd)[Va − Vfb − kT/e](4)here C is the space charge layer capacitance, ε is the dielectric constant of the material, ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum, e is the elemental charge, Nd is the concentration of charge carriers, Va is the applied potential, Vfb is the flat band potential, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.
3. Results and discussion
Generally, the photoelectrochemical activity of BiVO4 is dependent on its morphology, while the BiVO4 morphology is strongly dependent on the synthesis method and conditions. To optimize the photoelectrochemical activity, BiVO4 films with different morphologies were synthesized on FTO substrates using a drop-casting method. The synthesis conditions and the corresponding products are summarized in Table 1.

Fig. 1 shows SEM images for the BiVO4 films synthesized from a precursor solution containing equimolar Bi3+ and V3+ with different amounts of polyethylene glycol 600 (PEG-600). As shown in Fig. 1a, non-uniform flake-like BiVO4 are obtained from the PEG-600-free precursor solution. In addition, the edge of the film is cracked and the coverage is not uniform because of precursor solution bubbling during the annealing process (see Fig. S1a in the ESI†). Adding PEG-600 into the precursor solution (Bi:V:PEG-600 = 2:2:1, volume ratio) results in uniform BiVO4 films on the FTO substrate (Fig. S1b†). The top-view and cross-sectional images in Fig. 1b and c revealed that the BiVO4 film is composed of flakes with an average thickness of 20 nm and length of 2 μm. Interestingly, the morphology of the BiVO4 film completely changed when more PEG-600 was added into the precursor solution. As shown in Fig. 1d, the BiVO4 film synthesized from a higher-concentration PEG-600 precursor solution (Bi:V:PEG-600 = 2:2:2) consists of agglomerated BiVO4 nanoparticles. Additionally, the coverage, especially near the edge of the film is worse (see Fig. S1c†), which is similar to BiVO4 films synthesized from the PEG-600-free precursor solution. From these results, it is clear that the macroscopic homogeneity of the BiVO4 film as well as the morphology is controllable by adding PEG-600 into the precursor solution. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is commonly used as a morphology-directing agent for synthesizing nanostructured materials, usually acting by confining crystal growth in certain directions.33–35 It has been reported that PEG can play a role as the morphology-directing agent in synthesis of some metal oxides such as ZnO and Fe3O4 nanowires, mesoporous WO3 and WO3 nanoflakes.30–32,36 In the present work, to confirm the effect of PEG-600, we added polyethylene glycol 300 (PEG-300) into the precursor solution as a morphology-directing agent for synthesizing nanostructured BiVO4, it was found that the BiVO4 film synthesized from this precursor solution did not adhere well to the FTO substrate and the film consisted of highly non-uniform BiVO4 (see Fig. S2, ESI†). The crystal structure of the films synthesized with varying PEG-600 content was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the patterns are shown in Fig. S3 of the ESI.† All of the as-synthesized films could be indexed to monoclinic BiVO4 (JCPDS no. 01-075-1867).

The dependence of the BiVO4 nanostructures on the precursor solution drying time is shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2a shows a SEM image of the BiVO4 film synthesized from the drop-casting method without a precursor solution drying process, i.e., the precursor solution was drop-cast on the FTO substrates, and then directly annealed at 500 °C for 2.5 hours. As shown in Fig. 2a, a flake array of BiVO4 was formed, but the thickness of the flakes was not highly uniform. This may be attributed to the quick evaporation of precursor solution during the high temperature annealing process resulting in uneven growth of BiVO4 crystals. We added an intermediate drying step for the precursor solution at 135 °C for 55 min to form a uniform colloid film and then annealed it at 500 °C for 2.5 hours. As shown in Fig. 2b, BiVO4 nanoflake arrays were obtained after this drying step was included. Nevertheless, the colloidal BiVO4 appears to agglomerate too much with a longer drying time (110 min), leading to larger, thicker BiVO4 flakes (see Fig. 2c).

The photoelectrochemical activity of nanostructured BiVO4 films (shown in Fig. 1a, b, 2a and c) was investigated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The LSV measurements were conducted in 0.2 M Na2SO4 and 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.6) illuminated with 100 mW cm−2 simulated solar light. The LSV results indicated that the BiVO4 film (shown in Fig. 1b and 2b) synthesized from the precursor solution with a Bi:V:PEG-600 volume ratio of 2:2:1 and dried at 135 °C for 55 min has the best photoelectrochemical activity (see Fig. S4, ESI†). Thus, this precursor solution and drying condition was used to synthesize the un-doped and doped BiVO4 films for subsequent experiments.
Based on previous studies, it was found that Mo and W doped BiVO4 films have better photoelectrochemical activity than un-doped BiVO4 films for water oxidation, especially 2.5% W doped, 5% Mo doped and 2% W, 6% Mo co-doped BiVO4 films.21,22 Herein we synthesized the corresponding doped BiVO4 films by adding appropriate amounts of W and Mo into the BiVO4 precursor solutions. As shown in Fig. 3, the doped BiVO4 films exhibit similar morphology compared to the un-doped BiVO4 films, although some small differences from the un-doped films due to the co-incorporation of W and Mo are visible. XRD performed on these films (Fig. 4) showed no tungsten or molybdenum oxide formation, implying the different morphology flakes are still single phase BiVO4.

The XRD measurements were conducted using powder samples that were scraped from the films. In the pure BiVO4 pattern, all of the characteristic diffraction peaks are in good agreement with the standard data for monoclinic BiVO4 (JCPDS no. 01-075-1867). For the doped samples, only peaks for monoclinic BiVO4 were observed. However, as highlighted in Fig. 4a, three pairs of BiVO4 peaks tended to merge into three single peaks after doping. For example, the (200) BiVO4 peak at 34.5° and (002) peak at 35.2° shifted toward each other for 2.5% W doped BiVO4, and the two peaks merged into a single peak at 34.9° for 5% Mo doped and 2% W, 6% Mo co-doped BiVO4 samples. This behavior was also observed for the (240) and (042) peaks at 46.7° and 47.9° and the (321) and (123) peaks at 58.3° and 59.4°. Similar observations were reported in previous work related to Mo and W doped BiVO4.21,22 The merging of peaks can be attributed to a change in the crystal structure from monoclinic to tetragonal symmetry.37 The surface composition of the films was verified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. The high resolution XPS spectra of the Bi 4f, O 1s, V 2p, Mo 3d and W 4f binding energy regions for a representative 2% W, 6% Mo co-doped BiVO4 sample are shown from Fig. 4b to e. The characteristic orbital splitting of the Bi 4f5/2 and Bi 4f7/2 peaks (Fig. 4b), and the V 2p1/2 and V 2p3/2 peaks (Fig. 4c) were observed with peak locations of 164.4, 159.1, 524.4 and 516.9 eV, respectively, closely matching the Bi3+ and V5+ peaks in monoclinic scheelite BiVO4.22,38 For the O 1s peak, an additional small peak was seen which can be attributed to hydroxyls binding at defect sites.22,39 The Mo 3d3/2 and Mo 3d5/2 peaks were located at 235.4 and 232.2 eV (Fig. 4d), and the W 4f 5/2 and 4f 7/2 peaks were observed at 37.3 and 35.2 eV (Fig. 4e), confirming the presence of Mo6+ and W6+ species in BiVO4.40,41 Using the XPS spectra, the Bi:V:W:Mo atomic ratios of the films were measured and are summarized in Table 2.

Fig. 5a shows the average chopped LSV collected from the BiVO4 nanoparticle films (the film shown in Fig. 1d), BiVO4 nanoflake array films (shown in Fig. 1b and 2b), 2.5% W doped BiVO4 films (shown in Fig. 3a), 5% Mo doped BiVO4 films (shown in Fig. 3b) and 2% W, 6% Mo co-doped BiVO4 films (shown in Fig. 3c) in 0.2 M Na2SO4 and 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.6) illuminated with 100 mW cm−2 light. The original LSV's measured on 12 films are shown in Fig. S5 of the ESI.† As shown in Fig. 5a, the lowest photocurrent was generated by the BiVO4 nanoparticle film. In contrast, the BiVO4 nanoflake array film showed a more pronounced photoresponse, indicating that the nanoflake structure is advantageous for achieving higher photoelectrochemical activity. For example, at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, the photocurrent density for the nanoflake array film was 0.68 mA cm−2 and 0.23 mA cm−2 for the nanoparticle film. The higher activity of the BiVO4 nanoflake array film is due to a larger film/electrolyte interfacial area and reduction of the necessary hole transport length compared to the nanoparticle film. After doping with W and Mo, the nanostructured BiVO4 films show further enhanced activity. With respect to the photocurrent density for the doped BiVO4 films, there is little difference between the 5% Mo–BiVO4 film (1.29 mA cm−2 at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl) and the 2% W, 6% Mo co-doped BiVO4 film (1.28 mA cm−2 at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl), but both are higher than that for the 2.5% W–BiVO4 film (0.91 mA cm−2 at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl). For further comparison, we tested the films in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.9) with 0.2 M Na2SO3 added as a hole scavenger. In general, the results (see Fig. 5b) are consistent with the chopped LSV results measured in the buffered 0.2 M Na2SO4. Namely, the photoelectrochemical activity of the BiVO4 nanoflake array film was better than that of the nanoparticle film and the doped BiVO4 films' activity was higher than the un-doped BiVO4 films. It is noteworthy that the 2% W, 6% Mo co-doped BiVO4 film shows the highest photocurrent out of all the films tested in Na2SO3 solution. In summary, the photoelectrochemical activity of the films can be ranked in the following order: BiVO4 nanoparticle film < BiVO4 nanoflake array film <2.5% W–BiVO4 nanoflake array film <5% Mo–BiVO4 nanoflake array film <2% W, 6% Mo–BiVO4 nanoflake array film. The present results are similar to our previous study and a scanning electrochemical microscopy study of BiVO4 doping that found W, Mo co-doped BiVO4 resulted in higher photoelectrochemical activity for water oxidation than individual Mo and W doped BiVO4 and un-doped BiVO4.21,22 DFT calculations suggest that W and Mo can act as effective shallow donors to increase the total carrier density, which could result in enhanced photoelectrochemical activity.21,23,42 On the other hand, experimental data from Abdi et al. showed that W doping of BiVO4 decreases the carrier mobility by introducing mid-bandgap defects which act as carrier traps.20 DFT calculations show that W and Mo doping into BiVO4 may produce excellent n-type conductivity.42 And Hoffart et al. showed that 5% Mo doped BiVO4 had a total conductivity at least an order of magnitude higher than BiVO4 at 600 °C.43 Thus, the improved conductivity in doped BiVO4 may enhance its photoelectrochemical activity.

The scan rate was 25 mV s−1. 
In order to understand the origin of the photoelectrochemical activity enhancement in the doped film, we investigated the optical behavior of the films using UV-vis absorbance spectroscopy (see Fig. S6a†). Regardless of the amount of W and Mo incorporation, all of the films had a band gap of approximately 2.4 eV (Fig. S6b†) and similar absorbed photon flux, indicating this cannot be the sole cause of the increased photoactivity (Fig. S6c†). In addition, the water oxidation kinetics at the interface of the photoanode/electrolyte were evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).23,28,44 The EIS spectra are presented as Nyquist plots in Fig. 6a. The EIS measurements were performed in 0.2 M Na2SO4 and 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.6) under simulated solar light illumination (100 mW cm−2). The Nyquist plots were interpreted in terms of the equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Fig. 6a. In the plot, the symbols indicate the experimental results and the lines represent fitting results. In the equivalent circuit, Rs is the solution resistance, CPE is the constant phase element for the electrolyte/electrode interface, and Rct is the charge transfer resistance across the electrode/electrolyte interface. The arcs in the Nyquist plot are related to charge transfer at the interface of the electrode/electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 6a, under illumination both Nyquist diagrams display a typical semicircle arc in the measured frequency region, and the semicircle arc for the 2% W, 6% Mo co-doped BiVO4 film was smaller than that for the BiVO4 film, indicating faster water oxidation kinetics. As shown in Table 3, the Rct value for the BiVO4 film was 3216 Ω and for the 2% W, 6% Mo co-doped BiVO4 film the value was 2931 Ω. Therefore, the enhanced photoelectrochemical activity for the 2% W, 6% Mo co-doped BiVO4 film may be ascribed to the enhanced water oxidation kinetics.

The flat band potentials of the BiVO4 nanoflake array film and the 2% W, 6% Mo co-doped BiVO4 film were also measured in 0.2 M Na2SO4 and 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.6). Fig. 6b and c present the Mott–Schottky plots (1/C2vs. V) measured at different frequencies. The Mott–Schottky plots for the BiVO4 and the co-doped BiVO4 film both showed quasi-linear behavior. The plots indicate that the flat band potentials of the BiVO4 film and 2% W, 6% Mo co-doped BiVO4 film were around −0.45 V and −0.35 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), respectively. Although the measured flat band potentials have certain deviations due to nanostructuring,45 since the deviations should be similar for both films, it seems that that the flat band position of the co-doped BiVO4 film shows a positive shift of about 100 mV compared with the un-doped BiVO4 film. This is consistent with previous work related to W and Mo doped BiVO4 showing a positive shift of the flat band potential.21–23
The stability of the films was investigated by chronoamperometry. We first conducted stability testing in 0.2 M Na2SO4 solution and 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.6) at a constant applied potential of 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. As shown in Fig. 7a, the photocurrent on all of the films decreased after 3600 seconds of testing under illumination in Na2SO4 solution, which was mainly ascribed to material photocorrosion and vanadium dissolution.15,46 XPS analysis of the BiVO4 film reveals that the atomic ratio of Bi/V increased from 52/48 to 55/45 after the stability testing, indicating a loss of vanadium at the surface. Furthermore, the SEM images acquired from the BiVO4 film shows that the BiVO4 nanoflakes were damaged after 3600 seconds of illumination during stability testing (see Fig. S7 in ESI†). However, the photoelectrochemical activity of the films tend to stabilize after the rapid initial decrease in photocurrent in 0.2 M Na2SO3 solution and 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.9) (see Fig. 7b) because of the protection provided by SO3− against photocorrosion. This indicates that the corrosion mainly occurs at the surface and the holes may be quickly injected into the SO3− before having a chance to promote a reaction within the BiVO4. Generally, the i–t testing results are consistent with the chopped LSV results in Na2SO3 solution. On the other hand, the 2% W, 6% Mo co-doped BiVO4 film showed the highest photocurrent retention both in Na2SO4 and Na2SO3 solution, this point is a little different from the chopped LSV result measured in Na2SO4 where 5% Mo doped films have the highest photocurrent.

The relationship between the photoelectrochemical activity and the wavelength of the incident light was investigated by incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE). Fig. 8 shows the IPCE spectra for the films measured in 0.2 M Na2SO4 buffered solution at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl and 0.2 M Na2SO3 buffered solution at 0.5 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), the spectra are integrated and compared to the LSV results in Tables S1 and S2.† For all of the films, the photoresponse was observed from 340 to 520 nm, which is in agreement with their UV-vis absorbance spectra. Additionally, in comparison to the BiVO4 films, the doped BiVO4 films exhibit enhanced IPCE over the entire absorption region and the 2% W, 6% Mo co-doped BiVO4 film presents the highest IPCE. The IPCE results further confirmed W and Mo co-doping of BiVO4 enhances the harvesting of photons for photoelectrochemical reactions.

4. Conclusions
In summary, a simple drop-casting method was developed to synthesize un-doped and doped BiVO4 nanoflake array films on FTO coated glass substrates. The influence of synthesis parameters including the amount of polyethylene glycol 600 (PEG-600) and the precursor solution drying time on the growth of BiVO4 film were investigated to optimize the films for photoelectrochemical water oxidation. The BiVO4 films synthesized from a precursor solution containing Bi3+, V3+ and PEG-600 with a Bi:V:PEG-600 volume ratio of 2:2:1 dried at 135 °C for 55 min were composed of nanoflake arrays with an average thickness of 20 nm and length of 2 μm. The electrochemical results show that the BiVO4 nanoflake array films have higher photoelectrochemical activity than the BiVO4 nanoparticle films. Additionally, further enhanced photoelectrochemical activity was observed on the 2% W and 6% Mo co-doped BiVO4 film. We believe that this facile drop-casting method may be suitable for synthesizing nanostructured BiVO4-based materials for use in solar energy devices.
