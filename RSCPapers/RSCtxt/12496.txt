    , Accepted 23rd November 2012First published on 23rd November 2012AbstractThe SrTiO3 films were synthesized by a hydrothermal method using TiO2 nanotube arrays as the precursor. The photoanode of SrTiO3 film decorated by carbon quantum dots (CQDs) is capable of converting near IR photon energy to photocurrent. Efficient carrier transfer and a high electron/hole separation rate of the hetero-junction between the CQDs and SrTiO3 were achieved.
The design and modification of photocatalysts to use sun light energy in applications is essential work to solve the global energy problem.1–5 Of particular interest are one-dimensional (1-D) architectures, such as TiO2 nanotube arrays, which serve as a scaffold to anchor light-harvesting assemblies and have been successfully employed in dye- and quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells.6–12 Such one-dimensional architectures minimize the loss of charge carriers at grain boundaries and facilitate transport of charge carriers and thus have greater photo-to-current efficiency than mesoscopic or particulate semiconductor films. However, TiO2 when employed as a photoanode in the water-splitting reaction exhibits a relatively low efficiency since its conduction band edge is not much higher than the energy level for reduction of H+ to H2.13–16
SrTiO3 offers favorable energy for photocatalysis since its conduction band edge is about 200 mV higher than TiO2.17 Moreover, SrTiO3 is a stable n-type semiconductor with a band gap of about 3.2 eV, making it a promising candidate for efficient photocatalysts and photoelectrodes for splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen. Numerous studies by band-gap engineering have been focused on modifying SrTiO3 with transition metal ions and nitrogen for improving the solar light absorption.18–20 Another way, by forming a heterostructure with various quantum dots (QDs), such as CdS, CdSe, InP, and PbS QDs, combined with TiO2 is considered to be an efficient way to suppress the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and is proposed as the origin of the visible light activity.21 Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) have received much attention due to their superiority in chemical inertness, biocompatibility and low toxicity.22 Recently, CQDs are reported to have a role in improving the recombination inhibition and electron transfer enhancement of TiO2 solar cells.23 However, there has been little study regarded CQDs–SrTiO3 semiconductor composites for opto-electronic conversion. Herein, we report the effect of loading CQDs on the photoelectric response of SrTiO3 films, which is converted on the basis of nanotubular TiO2 fabricated by self-organizing anodization of Ti. Improved photovoltaic and photocatalytic performance were observed. Accordingly, a reasonable explanation is proposed to illustrate the key roles of CQDs in the photoelectric conversion process based on the measurements of photo-to-current conversion efficiency, electrochemical impedance and photoluminescence spectra.
The SrTiO3 film was evolved from the TiO2 nanotubes (NTs) to the SrTiO3 form. TiO2 NTs were fabricated by anodization of Ti foils. Anodization was performed for 60 min at room temperature (20 °C) in a two-electrode configuration, which was connected to a 60 V DC power supply with Ti foil as the working electrode, and a graphite rod as the counter electrode.24 The morphology of TiO2 NTs is regular, the diameter size is uniform, about 100 nm, and the nozzles are round. SrTiO3 films oriented on a Ti substrate were prepared by utilizing the preformed anatase nanotube arrays as a TiO2 source as well as a structure-directing scaffold. Fig. 1a and b depict the SEM images of the as-obtained products after 24 h of hydrothermal treatment. After the hydrothermal reaction, the morphology of the highly ordered TiO2 NTs is transformed to a vertically grown film on the Ti substrates (Fig. 1b), and the as-prepared globular particles on the surface were ∼80 nm in diameter (Fig. 1a and c). To confirm the formation of the CQDs–SrTiO3 complex structure, a high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image was recorded and is shown in Fig. 1d. As shown in the picture, the interplanar spacing of 2.76 Å was clearly observed, which corresponds to the (110) crystallographic plane of SrTiO3 and is in good agreement with the JCPDS card No. 40-1500. Alongside the SrTiO3 particles, the lattice spacing of around 3.21 Å corresponds to the (002) spacing of graphitic carbon, which is evidence for the formation of the CQDs–SrTiO3 complex structure.

Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the XRD pattern of a SrTiO3 film prepared by the hydrothermal method at 180 °C for 24 h, comparing with those of TiO2 NTs arrays and Ti substrates. All of their characteristic peaks, which represent the phase formation of SrTiO3 are in good agreement with a cubic perovskite structure of SrTiO3 (JCPDS card No. 40-1500). The peaks of Ti are inevitable due to the thinner film and its porous structure. The results indicate that the cubic SrTiO3 can be successfully synthesized from the TiO2 template by hydrothermal treatment for 24 h.25 In the following experiments, CQDs were loaded on the SrTiO3 (STO) film by electrochemical deposition for 60 seconds. However, the characteristic peak for carbon at 26° is too weak to be observed,22,26 which is due to the small size (about 4 nm) and relatively small quantity of CQDs in the composites. Therefore, Raman spectra were recorded to confirm the existence of carbon in the complex structures of CQDs–SrTiO3 (STO-C). As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), except for the peaks coming from STO, two characteristic peaks located at about 1335 and 1607 cm−1 are observed in the Raman spectra of STO-C, corresponding to the D-band and G-band of carbon, respectively.26
UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of STO and STO-C were recorded and are given in Fig. S3 (ESI†). It can be clearly seen that pure STO can absorb solar energy with wavelengths shorter than 390 nm, in agreement with the results previously reported.27 Compared with pure STO, STO-C displays continuous strong absorption in the range 400–800 nm, consistent with that the colour of the STO surface changes from white to black after the CQDs loading. This point implies that the complex may have higher photocatalytic activity for target reactions and CQDs may play important roles in utilizing sunlight.
The photoelectrochemical (PEC) activity of the STO-C film was examined by monitoring the photocurrent response under solar light. The effect of electro-deposition time for CQDs on the photocurrent response of the SrTiO3 film was also investigated. Amperometric photocurrent–time (I–T) measurements, shown in Fig. 2, recorded fast photoresponses on STO and STO-C films under conditions of alternating light on and off. A bare STO layer on the Ti substrate exhibits a photocurrent of about 45 μA cm−2. Note that this value is obviously larger than those obtained in ordinary SrTiO3 films.28 We proposed that the films vertically grown along the Ti substrate have the ability to transport charge carriers more easily than the particulate films, leading to the improvement of the photocurrent. 30 s deposition of CQDs on the STO surface (STO-C2) enhances the photocurrent to about 55 μA cm−2. The photocurrent increases further to about 105 μA cm−2 as the deposition time increases from 30 s to 60 s. This suggests that decorating STO with CQDs effectively enhances the PEC performance of STO films. Fig. 2 also illustrates that a longer deposition time than 60 s for STO-C4 has a negative effect on the photocurrent of the STO-C heterostructure. We proposed that more CQDs on the SrTiO3 surface may affect its light absorption, and hence the lowered photocurrent.

Fig. 3 shows the current vs. potential scans for STO-C and STO electrodes performed in 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution under the chopped light illumination. Both electrodes gave an anodic photocurrent, indicating the n-type character as reported previously.29 The chopped light photocurrent has a rapid rise at −0.25 V vs. Ag/AgCl for STO-C, which is a negative shift relative to −0.05 V vs. Ag/AgCl for STO. Clearly, CQDs loading causes the zero photocurrent potential of SrTiO3 film to shift negatively. This may lead to the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes more effectively, as will be discussed further in the following.

The enhanced photocatalytic properties of the STO-C composite was deducted from the photodegradation of methyl orange (MO). The systematic data of the photodegradation by the STO, STO-C1, STO-C2, STO-C3 and STO-C4 under simulated sunlight irradiations were plotted in Fig. S4 (ESI†). We can see that STO-C samples exhibit higher photocatalytic activities than pure STO. Among them, STO-C3 exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity and the MO dye can be almost decomposed within 4 h under light irradiation. Obviously, the photocatalytic ability sequence for STO-C3 > STO-C4 > STO-C2 > STO-C1 > STO is consistent with the photocurrent results shown in Fig. 2. The reason for the improved photocatalysis can be traced to the enhanced adsorptivity, the extended light absorption range (as evident from the UV-vis and IPCE spectra in Fig. S3, ESI† and Fig. 4), and the enhanced charge separation and transport (as evident from Fig. 4).

(d) Up-converted PL spectra of CQDs. The energy distribution of up-converted emissions of CQDs in the range 300–375 nm is shown as a shaded area. The excitation wavelengths are 800 nm (blue line), 830 nm (red line), 860 nm (black line), 890 nm (magenta line) and 920 nm (cyan line), respectively. 
To investigate the energy transfer process in the CQDs–SrTiO3 complex system, the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the two electrodes (pure STO and STO-C3 (denoted as STO-C)) were measured at different wavelengths with the illumination under monochromatic light. Fig. 4 displays the IPCE spectra of the two electrodes (black and red lines for STO and STO-C, respectively). As shown in Fig. 4a and b, there is one onset wavelength around 390 nm for STO, while for STO-C, besides the one at 390 nm, another smaller peak of ca. 1% quantum efficiency (QE) appears at 860 nm. Here, the onset wavelength at around 390 nm is attributed to the band gap energy of SrTiO3. The main peak of ca. 13% QE at 345 nm for STO-C increased 3% compared to that of the pure STO film. Takai and Kamat30 reported that the electron storage within the Ag nanoparticles assists in attaining a more negative Fermi level at the Ag/TiO2 film as compared to the plain TiO2 electrode, resulting in an improved PEC performance. In this study, it is revealed in Fig. 3 that the zero-current potential of the STO-C sample also shifted to a negative one as compared to that of the bare STO. Therefore, we proposed that a more effective separation of photo-generated electron/hole pairs and fast charge transfer to the electron donor/electron acceptor happens in the STO-C sample, resulting in the enhancement of QE at 345 nm. To confirm this point, the corresponding electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) measurement was carried out by using the two samples as the working electrodes in the solution. In Fig. 4c the samples show pronounced arcs at higher frequencies, whose diameters manifest the reaction rate occurring at the surface of electrode.24,31 Based on the Nyquist plots, significant changes in the EIS spectra are observed for the STO-C sample. The semicircle of the STO-C electrode is much smaller than that of the bare STO, indicating a more effective separation of photo-generated electron/hole pairs and fast charge transfer to the electron donor/electron acceptor on the STO-C surface.

Fig. 4b shows the enlarged IPCE comparison of two samples at around 860 nm. It is worth noting that the peak at 860 nm is only presented in the red line for STO-C. IPCE spectra of STO-C in the near-infrared (NIR) range are consistent with the up-converted photoluminescence (PL) response of CQDs (see Fig. 4d). Consequently, it is reasonable to attribute the NIR photoelectric response of STO-C in IPCE spectra to the existence of the energy transfer from up-converted emission energy of CQDs to SrTiO3. To check this point, we investigated the photoluminescence (PL) of CQDs. Fig. 4d shows the PL spectra (250–600 nm) of CQDs excited by long wavelength light at 800, 830, 860, 890, 920 nm. We found that the emissions are located at shorter wavelengths of 300–600 nm. That is to say, CQDs have obvious up-converted PL behavior. As we know, only light with wavelength shorter than 375 nm can be used to excite SrTiO3 (bandgap about 3.4 eV) to form photogenerated electron/hole pairs, so the up-converted PL behavior of CQDs may make CQDs–SrTiO3 use more sunlight. Here, we further compared the detailed emission energy distribution located in the range 300–375 nm up-converted by CQDs (shaded area of Fig. 4d). Interestingly, we can see that for the excitation wavelengths from 800–920 nm, a large distribution with shorter emission wavelength in the useful area (300–375 nm) can be up-converted, which can be further used as excitation wavelength light for the generation of photo-induced electron/hole pairs in SrTiO3. Overall, the CQDs have enabled the absorption and conversion of near IR photon energy to electric current, serving as efficient energy harvesting and transfer components.
Based on all of the above experimental results, we can explain the enhanced photovoltaic and photocatalytic activity of the CQDs–SrTiO3 complex photocatalysts as follows. Firstly, during the photocatalytic process, CQDs can act as both electron acceptors and donors, in which the electrons can be easily transferred to the surface of SrTiO3 films, and the redundant electrons on SrTiO3 can be transferred to CQDs, resulting in the enhanced charge separation and transport of photogenerated carriers. Secondly, CQDs can absorb NIR light, and then emit shorter wavelength light (300–375 nm) as a result of upconversion, which in turn excites SrTiO3 to form electron/hole pairs. These above aspects account for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of CQDs–SrTiO3 compared to pure SrTiO3. Notably, since IR comprises 53% of solar energy, CQDs with excellent up-converted PL may provide a new approach to high-efficiency photocatalyst design for applications in energy technology.
In summary, we have developed a facile route for the fabrication of porous and solid SrTiO3 films by a template-free hydrothermal method using TiO2 NTs precursor and loading CQDs on the SrTiO3 surface by electrodeposition. The effect of electrodeposition time was studied, and the enhancement of photocurrent could be tuned by varying deposition time. The loaded CQDs result in an enhancement of the photocurrent response of SrTiO3 films. More significantly, the CQDs–SrTiO3 is responsive under near NIR irradiation owing to the energy upconversion ability of the CQDs. Based on the above results, a possible electron–hole transfer mechanism was also assumed.
Experimental section
Synthesis of CQDs–SrTiO3 nanocomposites
The CQDs were electrochemically deposited on the SrTiO3 films surface by placing a SrTiO3 electrode in different concentrations of CQDs solution at 20 °C. A nucleation pulse (E = −0.5 V against Ag/AgCl) was applied for 10 s, 30 s, 60 s, 90 s, respectively, to control the amount of CQDs on the SrTiO3 surface.
Characterization
The size and morphology of the samples were examined with a Philips XL30 FEG scanning electron microscope (SEM) at accelerating voltage of 20 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, obtained on a D/MAX-RB X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan) using Cu Kα radiation at a scan rate (2θ) of 0.05° s−1, were used to characterize the sample crystalline phases. The accelerating voltage and the applied current were 40 kV and 80 mA, respectively. The Raman spectra were obtained with a Renishaw Raman system model 1000 spectrometer with a 20 mW air-cooled argon ion laser (514.5 nm) as the exciting source (the laser power at the sample position was typically 400 μW with an average spot size of 1 μm in diameter). The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained at room temperature employing a Horiba JOBIN YVON Luminescence spectrometer FluoroMax-4. UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra were obtained on a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Lambda 750) equipped with an integrating sphere assembly. Fine BaSO4 powders were used as a reflectance standard.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
Photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out using a conventional three-electrode, single-compartment glass cell fitted with a synthesized quartz window. The electrolytic cell was filled with 0.1 M Na2SO4. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurement was performed using an IM6 electrochemical workstation in the frequency range from 1 Hz to 100 MHz.
