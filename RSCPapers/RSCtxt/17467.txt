Subsequent infiltration of poly(3-hexylthiophene), P3HT, as the electron donor generates an inorganic–organic active layer. Inverted solar cells fabricated with these active layers exhibit power-conversion efficiencies as high as 3.3%.

Introduction
The photovoltaic field has witnessed dramatic changes with the development of a fourth generation of solar cells comprised of both inorganic and organic materials.1 These so-called fourth generation solar cells have sparked research to develop hybrid organic–inorganic materials that show high photovoltaic performance at relatively low cost by leveraging the inherent attributes of both the inorganic and organic constituents. In recent years, much effort has been devoted to developing new synthetic routes for both inorganic and organic semiconductors that can effectively serve as either electron donors or acceptors in hybrid solar cells. From the organic side, for example, there has been substantial progress in the development of low-bandgap molecular and polymeric semiconductors to more effectively harness sunlight.2–5 Efforts in inorganic semiconductors have focused on the production of nanostructures since the optoelectronic properties of these nanoscale building blocks can show strong quantum-confinement effects.6
Several types of hybrid inorganic–organic solar cells have been fabricated employing various inorganic nanostructures, such as CdSe nanoparticles,7–9 CdS nanoparticles,10 TiO2 nanorods,11–13 WO3 nanowires,14 Sb-doped SnO2 nanowires,15 and ZnO nanowire arrays,16–22 intermixed with semiconducting polymers. Efficiencies ranging from 2–5% have been obtained, positioning the performance of these hybrids close to the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all organic solar cells comprising P3HT and PCBM as the donor and acceptor, respectively.23,24 Although the inorganic constituents in these devices have large bandgaps and have been demonstrated to be effective electron accepting materials, they have not overcome any of the limitations encountered with fullerene derivatives, such as poor photocarrier generation due to their limited absorption in the Vis-NIR region.25 To overcome this challenge, researchers have focused on the synthesis of low bandgap metal chalcogenide nanostructures to increase the spectral response of such devices. Low bandgap metal chalcogenide nanoparticles, such as PbS quantum dots,26,27 PbSe quantum dots,28 CuInS2 nanoparticles,29 CuO nanoparticles,30 Bi2S3 nanocystals,31–35 and FeS2 nanoparticles,36 have been recently incorporated into hybrid-inorganic solar cells achieving efficiencies as high as 5%. Nonetheless, the hybrid solar cells comprising these nanostructures are limited by inefficient electron transport from one discrete nanostructure to another within a contiguous polymer donor matrix.10,37,38 Amongst these inorganic nanostructures, Bi2S3 has been recognized as a key player in the fabrication of devices for solar energy conversion,31–33,39 thermoelectric technologies,40–42 and optoelectronics in the IR region due to its low toxicity, low bandgap (1.3–1.7 eV, which facilitates broad coverage of the solar spectrum),43,44 and strong absorptivity (105 cm−1).32
Although Bi2S3 has been demonstrated to function as the active ingredient in a photodetector with a photoconductivity gain of 10,45 the photovoltaic characteristics of devices comprising Bi2S3 remain sub-optimal, with hybrid devices demonstrating PCEs < 1%31,33 when compared to devices comprising other metal chalcogenides. In recent years, several groups have tried to address – without much success – the low PCEs of hybrid solar cells comprising Bi2S3 as the acceptor and P3HT as the donor.33 These low PCEs have been attributed to the polycrystalline nature of and the presence of surface defects on Bi2S3 nanostructures;33 poor intermixing between the organic and the inorganic semiconducting nanostructures; and the absence of a percolated transport path for electrons between individual Bi2S3 nanostructures.31,46 In view of these challenges, single-crystal Bi2S3 nanostructures in the form of nanowires have been prepared from metal salts and a sulfur source47,48 or from single-source precursors49–51 either by chemical-vapor deposition, sonochemical or hydrothermal procedures. Yet, we are unaware of any successful integration of such single-crystalline Bi2S3 nanostructures in functional devices to-date.
In this paper, we utilize a vacuum-filtration process – similar to that reported to fabricate carbon nanotubes networks52 – for the deposition of single-crystalline Bi2S3 nanowires into percolated networks to construct hybrid organic–inorganic solar cells. This technique offers two main advantages, i.e., it ensures an interconnected network of nanowires before the deposition of the organic component and it provides the ability to control the aggregation of inorganic nanowires. We fabricated inorganic–organic solar cells by spin-coating P3HT solutions atop the Bi2S3 nanowire networks. By controlling the concentrations of both the Bi2S3 dispersion and the P3HT solution, we can tailor the overall active layer thickness, which has allowed us to better balance electron and hole transport. This approach takes advantage of the high aspect ratio, high electron mobility, and complementary photon absorption of Bi2S3 nanowires and P3HT, while preserving solution processability of the active layers. We further discuss the role of morphology and optoelectronic properties of percolated Bi2S3 networks on the photovoltaic performance of Bi2S3:P3HT hybrid solar cells.
Experimental section
Synthesis of Bi2S3 nanowires
Bi2S3 nanowires were synthesized via a solvothermal approach. Briefly, 500 mg of bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (ACROS organics-AC40261) was dissolved in ethylene glycol. This solution was heated at 60 °C and stirred for 30 min until homogeneous and clear. Subsequently, 2 mL of 2-mercaptoethanol was added to the clear solution. The solution was then transferred to a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. The autoclave was sealed and kept at 150 °C for 24 h. After the reaction, the resulting black product was cooled to room temperature and washed repeatedly with copious amounts of isopropanol. Finally, the product was vacuum-dried at 60 °C for 6 h.
Fabrication of Bi2S3 percolated networks
We adopted a vacuum-filtration technique previously used to fabricate carbon nanotube networks to process the Bi2S3 nanowires.52 The as-synthesized Bi2S3 nanowires were suspended in isopropanol at a concentration of 0.1 mg mL−1. 25 mL of this Bi2S3 solution was vacuum-filtered over a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, 0.22 μm GSWP). After filtration, the nitrocellulose membrane comprising Bi2S3 nanowires was pressed against a pre-patterned ITO on glass substrate that had been coated with TiOx53 (with the nanowire network facing TiOx). Subsequently, the membrane-substrate stack was exposed to an acetone-vapor bath for 1.5 h to dissolve the nitrocellulose, leaving behind the nanowires on TiOx. The substrate along with the transferred Bi2S3 nanowires was then rinsed in liquid acetone and methanol to remove any residual nitrocellulose. We can tune the network thickness by varying the concentration of Bi2S3 dispersion prior to deposition. Thicknesses of 50, 140, 200, and 240 nm, for example, were obtained when 25 mL of Bi2S3 solutions having concentrations of 0.02, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.12 mg mL−1 were vacuum-filtered over a nitrocellulose membrane. All thicknesses (including neat Bi2S3 nanowire networks, P3HT films, and active layers) were determined by atomic force microscopy (AFM). We further corroborated these values by measuring the average heights of our layers via cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
Characterization

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). 
A Philips CM200 FEG-TEM equipped with a Gatan 678 Imaging Filter and operated at 200 keV was used to acquire high-resolution TEM images and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns. To prepare the samples for TEM/SAED analysis, the Bi2S3 nanowires were dispersed in 2-propanol and then deposited onto 300 mesh holey carbon-coated Cu grids.


Scanning electron microscopy (SEM). 
An SEM equipped with a field-emission gun (FE-SEM Quanta 400 FEG, FEI) was used to image the morphology and structure of Bi2S3 networks. The accelerating voltage was kept at 15 keV to prevent beam damage to the specimens.


Grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD). 
GIXD experiments were conducted at the G1 station (10.0 ± 0.1 keV) of the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source. The beam was selected to be 0.05 mm tall and 1 mm wide. The width of the samples was 0.5 cm; this smaller sample width was chosen to reduce geometric smearing of crystalline reflections.54–56 The beam energy was selected with synthetic multilayer optics (W/B4C, 23.6 Å d-spacing). The X-ray beam was aligned above the film's critical angle but below that of the substrate equivalent to 0.32° from the substrate. The scattered intensity was collected with a two-dimensional CCD detector. All GIXD images have been background subtracted; polarization and adsorption corrections were also applied, though these corrections were small.54–56


X-ray photoelectron (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron (UPS) spectroscopies. 
XPS data were collected using a VG ESCALab Mk.II hemispherical analyzer and a Mg Kα (1253.6 eV) source. A pass energy of 100 eV was used for survey scans, while a 20 eV pass energy was used for detailed scans. All measurements were carried out at normal take-off angles. The acquired spectra were calibrated against the adventitious carbon peak at 284.6 eV. Curve fitting was carried out using CasaXPS software with a Gaussian–Lorentzian product function and a non-linear Shirley background. The vacuum system is also equipped with He I (21.22 eV) and He II (40.81 eV) discharge lamps for performing UPS measurements. The energy resolution of the UPS system is 150 meV, as determined from the width of the Fermi edge on a freshly deposited Au surface.

Device fabrication

Bi2S3 networks:P3HT solar cells. 
To assemble Bi2S3:P3HT active layers, a solution of P3HT (Merck Chemical Ltd.) in chlorobenzene at 25 mg mL−1 was spin-coated at 500 rpm for 60 s atop the Bi2S3 percolated networks. The combined active layer of Bi2S3 nanowire network and P3HT was 320 nm thick. Successively, a 7 nm thick layer of MoO3 was thermally evaporated atop the active layer. To complete the solar cells, a 100 nm thick layer of Au was deposited by thermal evaporation through stencil masks as top electrodes. The active area for each device was 0.18 cm2. After device fabrication, the completed solar cells were annealed at 150 °C for 10 min to induce further infiltration and crystallization of the polymer. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were acquired using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit under AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination in air.

Results and discussion
The ability to control the size, shape, and composition of Bi2S3 nanostructures is imperative for investigating their intrinsic optoelectronic properties. Prior to the assembly of Bi2S3 into percolated networks, we performed rigorous morphological and structural characterization of the as-synthesized Bi2S3 nanowires. From the morphological and structural characterization presented in Fig. S1 of the ESI,† we can ascertain that our nanowires are phase-pure and dimensionally-uniform having an average length of 25 ± 5 μm and an average diameter of 30 ± 5 nm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements provided additional insight on the structure of the Bi2S3 nanowires. Fig. 1A displays a representative TEM image of the nanowires dispersed on a holey carbon film supported on a Cu-TEM grid. Fig. 1B shows a lattice-resolved high-resolution TEM image of a Bi2S3 single-nanowire tilted along its c-axis. This image shows the presence of two-dimensional lattice fringes in the Bi2S3 nanowire. The absence of any grain boundaries suggests that the as-synthesized nanowire is single-crystalline in nature. The crystal planes that are parallel and perpendicular to the fast growth direction of the nanowire have observed lattice spacings of 7.96 Å and 3.98 Å, corresponding to the characteristic spacings of the (110) and (001) planes, respectively, of the orthorhombic Bi2S3 unit cell. Furthermore, fast Fourier transform (FFT) of an image taken along the [−110] direction reveals distinct spots, further verifying that the obtained structures are single-crystalline in nature. The FFT images also confirm our identification of the (110) and (001) planes. Collectively, the high-resolution TEM and the FFT images indicate that growth of the Bi2S3 nanowires take place along the [001] direction.

The image shows that the [001] direction is the fast-growth direction (or the nanowire axis). The inset depicts the FFT of the nanowire lattice image viewed along the [−110] zone axis. The distinct spots observed in the inset indicate that the nanowire is single crystalline in nature. 
Electrical characterization of individual Bi2S3 nanowires in field-effect transistors (Fig. S2†) shows that Bi2S3 nanowires behave as an n-type semiconductor with an estimated field-effect electron mobility of 1.3 cm2 V−1 s−1. In addition, UV-Vis absorption and UPS measurements allowed us to determine the electronic properties of our Bi2S3 nanowire networks. From the absorption data presented in Fig. S3,† we estimated an optical bandgap of 1.2 eV for our Bi2S3 nanowire networks. We obtained a work function of 4.8 eV by extrapolating the cut-off energy from the UPS spectrum presented in Fig. S4A.† From the same UPS data, we can also determine a valence band edge of 5.4 eV (Fig. S4B†). This calculated valence band edge is comparable to reported values for Bi2S3 nanorods.33 Based on the energy levels of Bi2S3 and published energy levels of P3HT,57–61 a type-II heterojunction should form between P3HT and Bi2S3.
Several methods of depositing Bi2S3 dispersions, such as drop-casting, spin-coating and dip-casting, were investigated to reliably fabricate Bi2S3 networks. These methods, however, lacked control over the average network thickness, often resulting in aggregation of the nanowires and non-uniform networks. On the other hand, vacuum filtering a dilute suspension of nanowires over a porous cellulose filtration membrane resulted in uniform networks of Bi2S3 nanowires whose average thickness can be varied by tuning the concentration of the dispersion. Fig. 2 shows SEM micrographs of three networks (A, B, and C) that have been prepared with different concentrations of Bi2S3 nanowire dispersions (25, 45, and 63 wt%, respectively). As evidenced in Fig. 2, the long axes of the nanowires in these networks appear to be randomly oriented in the plane of the substrate. The nanowires, even in the least dense (50 nm thick) Bi2S3 network (Fig. 2A), remain well dispersed over large areas and percolated over macroscopic distances. Fig. 2B shows a denser Bi2S3 network with an average thickness of 140 nm, whereas Fig. 2C depicts an SEM image of a network whose average thickness is 200 nm. These images demonstrate our ability to control the spatial uniformity and network thickness via this vacuum-filtration technique.

We further characterized these percolated Bi2S3 networks via XPS to verify that Bi2S3 is not chemically oxidized during the vacuum-filtration process. Fig. 3 shows the XPS spectra of a 140 nm-thick Bi2S3 nanowire network. The two strong peaks at ≈158.0 and 163.2 eV (Fig. 3A) are assigned to Bi4f7/2 and Bi4f5/2, respectively.51,62 The smaller pair of doublets at 160.5 eV and 161.7 eV correspond to the binding energies of S2p3/2 and S2p1/2, respectively.62 The peak at 224.8 eV, in Fig. 3B can be assigned to S2s.51,62 A small peak at 227.8 eV is observed; we ascribe it to unreacted thiols from the 2-mercaptoethanol precursor used in the synthesis of our Bi2S3 nanowires.63 Taking into account the atomic sensitivity factors of Bi and S64 during quantification of the peak areas of Bi 4f and S 2s, the atomic ratio of Bi/S is approximately 1.4. This ratio is in close agreement with the expected ratio of 1.5 for stoichiometric Bi2S3. No other peaks were observed in the full XPS spectrum indicating the absence of impurities in the percolated Bi2S3 network.

We fabricated inverted solar cells (inset in Fig. 4 shows the device architecture) by varying the thicknesses of the Bi2S3 and P3HT layers. We focused on creating and testing solar cells with three different layer thicknesses of percolated Bi2S3 networks, i.e., 50, 140, and 200 nm as the electron acceptor layer. We also varied the P3HT layer thickness. This exercise led to devices with PCEs ranging from 0.46–3.3% (the complete device characteristics of these devices are tabulated in Table S1†). The maximum PCE was achieved with a 200 nm-thick Bi2S3 network with a 120 nm-thick P3HT overlayer. The current–voltage characteristics of one such device under illumination is shown in Fig. 4A. Of 24 devices tested across six chips, the average open-circuit voltage (Voc) is 0.7 ± 0.01 V; the average short-circuit current density (Jsc) is 10.7 ± 0.1 mA cm−2; and the fill factor (FF) is 45 ± 5%, resulting in an average PCE of 3.3 ± 0.2%. Neglecting the presence of interfacial dipoles and vacuum level shifts60,61 when Bi2S3 and P3HT are brought into contact, the offset between the Bi2S3 conduction band edge and P3HT HOMO level in Fig. S5† suggests a maximum Voc of 1.0 eV. Our Voc of 0.7 V is not consistent with the energy diagram, especially considering other possible origins of losses65 and is comparable with values reported in the literature for polycrystalline Bi2S3-based devices.33 Our photocurrents, however, are substantially higher. To ensure that the photocurrents are reflective of that of individual devices, we have taken measures to eliminate a potential overestimation of the short circuit current.66 Testing in the presence of a stencil mask ensured a well-defined illuminated area; these measurements also yielded comparable photocurrents. Among devices with optimal active layer thicknesses, we attribute the high photocurrent to the quality of Bi2S3 nanowires and interfacial compatibility of P3HT with Bi2S3 in our devices in addition to the interconnectedness of P3HT and Bi2S3 nanowire networks. While still not competitive amongst the highest efficiencies of hybrid inorganic–organic solar cells,67–71 our devices exhibit the highest efficiencies amongst those reported for hybrid solar cells comprising Bi2S3 nanostructures and P3HT.31–33,72 Our FF, however, is consistently low, at 45%. We suspect the low but consistent FF in our devices to stem from substantial carrier recombination because of unbalanced charge transport given the mismatch in mobilities between Bi2S3 nanowires and P3HT.

The inset shows the inverted device architecture. (B) EQE spectrum as a function of the wavelength of monochromatic irradiation for the device whose J–V characteristics are shown in (A). 
Further verification that our photocurrents are those of individual cells stem from external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements. We have included in Fig. 4B the EQE spectrum for the same device whose J–V characteristics are shown in Fig. 4A. Integration of the EQE spectrum resulted in an estimated Jsc of 9.5 mA cm−2. This value is in close agreement with the measured Jsc extracted from the J–V characteristics. The device shows a broad EQE spectrum spanning a wavelength range of 300–720 nm. A maximum EQE of 62% is observed in a range of 490–550 nm; photocurrent generation at these wavelengths is attributed to photoabsorption and current generation by P3HT. As evidenced in our EQE spectrum, we also observe current generation beyond the band gap of P3HT at >650 nm. This contribution to the overall photocurrent, however, is small.
Questions, however, remain about the morphology of the Bi2S3:P3HT active layer. In an attempt to elucidate the structure, we conducted additional characterization of the active layer. Fig. 5A shows an indexed two-dimensional grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) image of a Bi2S3 network. As shown, these networks are crystalline and display out-of-plane reflections – albeit with a broad distribution of orientations (±30°) centered about the meridian – associated with the (020), (120), (220), and (130) planes of the orthorhombic unit cell belonging to the Pbnm space group of single-crystalline Bi2S3. The intensity distribution of the reflection corresponding to the (020) plane, in particular, is narrow, with most of its intensity centered about the meridian. This result is expected since the (020) plane is oriented directly out-of-plane when the nanowires are lying perfectly flat on the substrate. The intensity distributions for the reflections corresponding to the (130), (220), and (120) planes are broader and span a larger range of azimuthal angles. Given that the planes associated with these reflections are also generally normal to the (001) plane that is parallel to the nanowire long axis, the observation that their intensities are generally distributed about the meridian confirms that the nanowires are generally lying in the plane of the substrate. It follows that these out-of-plane reflections that are visible in the GIXD image in Fig. 5A correspond to the distribution of planes that are generally parallel to the substrate given the orientation variation of nanowires within the network. Fig. 5B displays the 2D GIXD image of a Bi2S3:P3HT active layer prior to top electrode deposition. Here, we observe reflections associated with both the crystallographic planes of P3HT and Bi2S3. We have labelled the reflections corresponding to the (100) and (200) planes of P3HT at scattering vectors of q = 0.37 Å−1 and 0.74 Å−1, respectively, for clarity. The intensity anisotropy along the azimuthal angle of these reflections indicate that P3HT is preferentially oriented with the (h00) planes parallel to the substrate. Correspondingly, we calculated the Herman's orientation function,16,17f, of the (100) reflection to quantify the orientation distribution of P3HT within the active layer. As discussed elsewhere,16,17,73fhkl can range from 1 to −0.5 wherein fhkl = 1 indicates perfect out-of-plane alignment of that (hkl) plane with respect to the substrate; fhkl = −0.5 indicates perfect alignment of that (hkl) plane in the plane of the substrate; and fhkl = 0 indicates no preferential alignment of that (hkl) plane. We obtained an f100 of 0.32. For comparison, f100 of 0.45 and 0.42 have been reported for P3HT in bulk-heterojunction active layers comprising PCBM and ZnO as acceptors, respectively.16,74 This analysis suggests that the P3HT in our active layers is less oriented than those in materials stacks where PCBM or ZnO serve as electron acceptors. We believe the fabrication and incorporation of vertically-oriented Bi2S3 scaffolds, as opposed to horizontally-oriented nanowires in networks, could induce further orientation in the P3HT layer.

For clarity, we have labelled the reflections associated with Bi2S3 in (A) as well as the (100) and (200) reflections of P3HT at q (scattering vector) = 0.37 Å−1 and 0.74 Å−1, respectively, in (B). 
Conclusions
In summary, we report the assembly of percolated Bi2S3 networks via a vacuum-filtration technique and the photovoltaic characterization of such networks as electron acceptors in hybrid solar cells. Efficiencies up to 3.3% was achieved for these devices. While we cannot clearly determine the complete infiltration of P3HT into the voids of our Bi2S3 nanowire network, we are confident that there is substantial intermixing between P3HT and Bi2S3 nanowire networks. We foresee surface modification of metal chalcogenides via adsorption of self-assembled monolayers as a means to tune the chemical/physical properties of the inorganic–organic interface; this approach was demonstrated to be successful in improving the interfacial compatibility between ZnO nanowires and P3HT, resulting in markedly improved photovoltaic devices.17

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (A) TEM image for Bi2S3 nanowires dispersed on a holey carbon film supported on a Cu-TEM grid. (B) Lattice-resolved high-resolution TEM image of an individual Bi2S3 nanowire. The image shows that the [001] direction is the fast-growth direction (or the nanowire axis). The inset depicts the FFT of the nanowire lattice image viewed along the [−110] zone axis. The distinct spots observed in the inset indicate that the nanowire is single crystalline in nature.	 

 	Fig. 2  SEM images of vacuum-filtered Bi2S3 nanowire networks with average thicknesses of (A) 50 nm, (B) 140 nm, and (C) 200 nm. These networks form percolated pathways that allow charge conduction over macroscopic distances.	 

 	Fig. 3  XPS spectra for a 140 nm thick Bi2S3 nanowire network. High-resolution scans of the (A) Bi 4f and (B) S 2s regions.	 

 	Fig. 4  (A) J–V characteristics under simulated AM 1.5G illumination of a photovoltaic device comprised of a 200 nm thick Bi2S3 nanowire network and a 120 nm thick P3HT layer. The inset shows the inverted device architecture. (B) EQE spectrum as a function of the wavelength of monochromatic irradiation for the device whose J–V characteristics are shown in (A).	 

 	Fig. 5  Two-dimensional GIXD images for (A) a Bi2S3 nanowire network prior to P3HT deposition and (B) the photoactive layer (Bi2S3:P3HT) prior to top electrode deposition. For clarity, we have labelled the reflections associated with Bi2S3 in (A) as well as the (100) and (200) reflections of P3HT at q (scattering vector) = 0.37 Å−1 and 0.74 Å−1, respectively, in (B).
