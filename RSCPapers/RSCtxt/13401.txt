    , Accepted 15th March 2023First published on 29th March 2023AbstractPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) are emerging technologies that have been heavily researched due to their outstanding photoelectric properties. However, the majority of recombination losses occur at the interface between perovskite and the ETL, resulting in their full potential not yet being reached. In this work, ionic liquid (IL) 1-buty-3-methylimidazole hydrogensulfate (BMIMHSO4) was employed to regulate the TiO2/perovskite interface. BMIMHSO4 formed a surface dipole, which realigned the TiO2 conduction band upward, allowing for faster charge extraction, and lower energy loss at the interface. Furthermore, the BMIMHSO4 induced a vertical crystal arrangement, decreased the perovskite defect density, and reduced the defect-induced charge recombination in MAPbI3-based PSCs. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) was improved from 15.92% to 19.13%. Moreover, the un-encapsulated device exhibited improved stability and retained 90% of its original value after 600 storage hours. This work demonstrated a practical technique to optimize the interface by applying an IL, thus achieving high-performance PSCs.
1. Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are coming into use in photovoltaic technologies on account of their excellent qualities, such as high absorption coefficients, outstanding carrier transport properties with long electron and hole diffusion lengths, low exciton binding energies, and easily regulable energy band gaps.1–4 The power conversation efficiency (PCE) of PSCs is over 25% in a short period of time.5,6 However, it is still below the ideal (31.64%) Shockly–Queisser limit efficiency.7 In addition, its stability is far from the commercial standard in environments with complicated heat and humidity surroundings. Hence, an improvement in the PCE and stability are essential to achieve commercialization of the device, particularly when it is manufactured in an atmosphere without a glovebox.
The photoelectric performance of PSCs is closely connected to non-radiative charge recombination in the bulk perovskite film and at the perovskite/ETL interface.8,9 While the instability mainly originates from external factors, for instance, temperature, oxygen, moisture, and ultraviolet light, it is also caused by several internal factors, including ion migration, interfacial defects, and interactions.10,11 It is believed that defect concentrations, generally at the interface, are approximately 100 times higher than the bulk perovskite film.12 Furthermore, the performance of the device is deteriorated by deep-level and severe non-radiative charge recombination at interface defects.13,14 The development of suitable interface molecules is therefore greatly anticipated in order to suppress and lower the defects of the perovskite/ETL interface. In the past decade, abundant interfacial modifiers have been witnessed to be applied in PSCs, particularly comprising inorganics,15,16 nanocarbon,17,18 and ionic liquid-based materials,19,20etc. Ionic liquids (ILs) are a green solvent containing anions and cations, and exhibit many outstanding properties, including a designable molecule composition, a wide liquid temperature range, a flat vapor pressure, involatility, strong conductivity, and good stability.21,22 Yin et al. reported that the IL BMIMPF6 was utilized to modify the dual-interface TiO2/CsPbI2Br, improving the energy level arrangement and reducing energy loss.23 Shi et al. employed the IL MAAc pre-deposited onto the TiO2 ETL, which acts as the nucleation center to impact the perovskite crystallization kinetics, resulting in decreased trap state density, suppression of non-radiative recombination, and extraction of charge carriers.24 Gao et al. inserted the IL FBABF4 into the SnO2/perovskite layer, which ameliorated interfacial contact through a chemical link due to the simultaneous fluorination of anions and cations.25 Therefore, if the ILs with high conductivity could simultaneously enable efficient interfacial charge transfer and high-quality perovskite films, the photovoltaic performance and operational stability of PSCs would be improved.
Herein, the IL 1-buty-3-methylimidazole hydrogensulfate (BMIMHSO4), with its structural formula displayed in Fig. S1,† was incorporated into the TiO2/perovskite interface to regulate both the electronic properties of the TiO2 film and the crystalline characteristic of the perovskite film. The BMIMHSO4 molecule could not only tune the conduction band, improve electron mobility, and decrease the contact resistance of TiO2, but it could also optimize and control the crystallinity, and reduce charge trapping and recombination in the perovskite film. Consequently, the efficiency and stability of the modified PSCs were improved. The highest PCE achieved was 19.13%, and after 600 h of storage in a dark environment of ∼40% relative humidity, the un-encapsulated device maintained 90% of its initial efficiency.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
Titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75 wt% in isopropanol) solution was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate (BMIMHSO4) was provided by Shanghai Maclin Biochemical Technology Co., LTD. PbI2, MAI, lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (Li-TFSI), 4-tert-butyl pyridine (tBP), 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis (N,N-di-p-methoxy-phenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD), and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) were obtained from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corporation. None of the aforementioned compounds underwent further purification prior to use.
2.2 Device fabrication
First, the glass substrates composed of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) underwent several 20 min ultrasonic cleaning processes using acetone, ethanol, and isopropyl alcohol. The substrates were dried at 100 °C, and the remaining organic compounds were removed using ultraviolet–ozone treatment for 20 min. Subsequently, the TiO2 solution with a concentration of 150 mg ml−1 was made by dissolving the titanium (diisopropoxide) bis(2,4-pentanedionate) in ethanol, which was then spin-coated onto the glass substrate at 4000 rpm for 30 s, followed by heating at 450 °C for 30 min. Then, different concentrations of BMIMHSO4 IL solution were prepared by dissolving in ethyl alcohol. Later, these solutions were spin-coated onto the TiO2 substrates at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by heating at 100 °C for 30 min. After that, the perovskite layer was deposited using an antisolvent-processed technique. The precursor solution was produced by mixing PbI2/MAI with a molar ratio of 1:1 in 1 ml of DMF/DMSO (4/1, v/v) solution, according to our previous report.26 The precursor solution was heated at 60 °C for 30 min. Then, a sequential spin-coated process was implemented at 2000 rpm for 10 s and 4000 rpm for 30 s. During the final 15 seconds of the second procedure, 300 μL of ethyl acetate was dripped onto the substrate, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 30 min. Afterward, the spiro-OMeTAD solution (72.3 mg of spiro-OMeTAD, 17.5 μL of Li-TFSI solution and 28.8 μL tBP in 1 ml chlorobenzene) was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s to form the film. Finally, the Ag electrode with a thickness of ∼80 nm was evaporated by thermal evaporation. As a result, the device of FTO/TiO2/(BMIMHSO4)/MAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag structure was obtained, as shown in Fig. S2.† In this paper, the active area is 0.06 cm2. Except for Ag deposition, all other stages were performed in an open environment with a relative humidity of ∼35%.
2.3 Characterization
The SEM images (top and cross-sectional views) of the samples were attained using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Ultra 55, Zeiss, Germany). The XPS and UPS spectra were conducted using an XPS instrument (ESCALAB Xi+). The source gun type was He I, and the energy of He I was 21.22 eV. FTIR spectroscopy was performed using a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (Nicolet™ iS50, America). X-ray diffraction patterns were measured using an XRD machine (Bruker D8 discover, Germany) with an X-ray tube (Cu Kα, λ = 1.5406 Å). UV-vis transmittance and absorption spectra were collected using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Mapada P4, China). The statical contacts were acquired using a contact-angle instrument (Krüss Optronic, Germany) and the test solvent was DMSO. All J–V curves were measured using a source meter (2400-SCS, Keithley) under AM 1.5 illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. PL and TRPL were measured via a spectrofluorometer (FS5, Edinburgh instruments), with the light source passing through from the perovskite side. The EIS was also performed using a potentiostat (Im6ex/Zahner) with a 10 mV AC amplitude and a frequency scanning range of 0.01–100 kHz.
3. Results and discussions
A schematic diagram of the operational mechanism of BMIMHSO4 IL with TiO2 and MAPbI3 is shown in Fig. 1. First, it was proven that the TiO2 film would generate a surface dipole after introducing BMIMHSO4, which aligns the work function and adjusts the energy level to perfectly match the perovskite level. Meanwhile, the interaction between BMIMHSO4 and TiO2 enhances electron extraction and decreases contact resistance at the interface. Next, it was also detected that the BMIMHSO4 could contribute to sufficient passivation of Pb-related defects in the perovskite film. Specifically, the formed π bond of the N–CN bond in the BMIM+ cation and SO from the HSO4− anion have a significant passivation interaction with Pb defects of the perovskite film. The anchor interaction decreases trap state density and induces a vertical crystal arrangement. Hence, BMIMHSO4 serves as a connection in TiO2 and perovskite layers, providing high-efficiency electron extraction and thus improving device performance.

The interfacial mechanism was detected by analyzing the TiO2/BMIMHSO4 interface and the BMIMHSO4/MAPbI3 interface, respectively. Primarily, we characterized the interface modification effect of the BMIMHSO4 modifier for the TiO2 ETL. When applying a minimum BMIMHSO4 concentration in our experiment, the signal belonging to the BMIMHSO4 molecule could be observed via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in Fig. 2a. This implies that BMIMHSO4 indeed remains on TiO2 since that is the premise to prove the key performance improvement of the device, and the above result identically verified by the high-resolution XPS spectra of S 2p and N 1s in Fig. S3† and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) in Fig. S4.† In particular, as shown in Fig. 2b, it can be found that the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks are located at 458.81 eV and 464.59 eV in the TiO2 film. They shift by around 0.21 eV and 0.26 eV when BMIMHSO4 is introduced to the TiO2 film, respectively. This result is in excellent agreement with previous studies,23,27 and is mainly due to the negative charges around the Ti atom being enhanced. This indicates that the ILs layer was effectively anchored on the TiO2 ETL surface and their electronic states changed. Meanwhile, the XPS spectra of O 1s, displayed in Fig. 2c, can be deconvolved into two peaks. The lower binding energy peaks are attributed to the bonding of O2− with Ti4+ (Ti–O), whereas the higher binding energy peaks are due to the hydroxyl groups on the TiO2 layer (Ti–O–H). It is noted that the peak position shifts from 529.99 eV for the TiO2 film to 529.77 eV for the TiO2-IL film, which further indicates a binding interaction between TiO2 and BMIMHSO4 IL. These results suggest that BMIMHSO4 generates a surface dipole to regulate the energy level of TiO2, aligning its work function so there is a minimal mismatch with the perovskite energy level.25,28

Subsequently, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was employed to investigate the BMIMHSO4/MAPbI3 interfacial interaction, as shown in Fig. 2d. The peaks at 1466 cm−1 and 1047 cm−1 can be clearly observed and are attributed to the CN and SO vibrations of BMIMHSO4, respectively, whereas the CN peak shifts to 1436 cm−1 in BMIMHSO4 and PbI2, which is attributed to the formation of bonds between Pb2+ and electron-rich N atoms.29 In addition, the SO vibration peak of BMIMHSO4 shifts to 1020 cm−1, which may be due to the coordination bond between Pb2+ and negatively charged –HSO4− groups.30 The above result implies that BMIMHSO4 with PbI2 have a strong interaction that enhanced the crystal and absorbance abilities of perovskite.
The above measurements clearly reveal the interactions of BMIMHSO4 in the TiO2/perovskite interface; hence BMIMHSO4 was applied to modify the interface. Firstly, the interfacial interaction of BMIMHSO4 with TiO2 was studied. SEM images of TiO2 and the TiO2-IL film are presented in Fig. S5,† and they show no obvious difference. To deeply investigate the surface properties of the ETL, atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed, and a subtle distinction can be found, as shown in Fig. 3a and b. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness is 9.33 nm for the TiO2-IL layer, which is lower than that of the TiO2 layer, being 12.46 nm. It is well known that a smoother surface is beneficial for the growth of perovskite and generates an improved electronic contact with the underlying ETL.31 The surface wettability of both the TiO2 layer and the TiO2-IL layer was determined by static contact angle measurements. The contact angle of the TiO2-IL layer is 10.90°, which is lower than 23.07° for the TiO2 layer. A smaller contact angle implies a better surface wettability, which leads to a reduction in Gibbs free energy to obtain higher density perovskite nucleation and a denser perovskite film.32

It is believed that charge accumulation and electrons transfer were greatly influenced by defects in ETL, which leads to a low electron mobility and conductivity.33 Therefore, we employed a space charge-limited current (SCLC) method to study the electron mobility with the device structure of FTO/Ag/ETL/Ag. The corresponding curves are plotted in Fig. 3c. The electron mobility (μ) was calculated according to the Mott–Gurney law in eqn (1). (1)where V is voltage, J is current density, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, ε is the relative dielectric constant of ETL, and L is the thickness of the ETL film.31 The calculated values are summarized in Table S1.† The electron mobility is 4.88 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 S−1 for the TiO2-IL film, which is three times higher than that of the TiO2 film, being 1.43 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 S−1. Moreover, the conductivity of the ETL was measured using a device structure of FTO/TiO2/(BMIMHSO4)/Ag. The current–voltage (I–V) characteristic curves are displayed in Fig. 3d. The conductivity (σ) was calculated by eqn (2). (2)where A is the area and d is the thickness of the samples.16 The calculated results are provided in Table S1.† The conductivity for the TiO2-IL film is 1.93 × 10−3 mS cm−1, which is higher than that of TiO2 (1.27 × 10−3 mS cm−1). The improved electron mobility and conductivity demonstrate that the charge transfer can be greatly improved with the introduction of BMIMHSO4, which strongly suppresses the interfacial charge accumulation; thus, achieving a high efficiency would be possible.7,34
The optical transmission spectra for TiO2 layer and TiO2-IL layer are shown in Fig. S7(a).† It can be found that both the TiO2 and TiO2-IL film exhibit high optical transmission in the wavelength range of 300 to 800 nm, indicating admirable optical properties. In particular, the TiO2-IL film shows a higher transmission ability in the short wavelength range, which contributes to the enhancement of light harvesting of the perovskite absorber for higher solar cell efficiency.35 Subsequently, we determined the optical bandgap (Eg) of the ETL by the Tauc plot method according to eqn (3). αhvm = B(hv − Eg)(3)where α is the absorption coefficient, hv stands for the incident photon energy, B is an energy independent constant, and m equals 2.36 The calculated Eg values for the TiO2-IL film and the TiO2 film are 3.78 and 3.79 eV in Fig. S7(b),† respectively. The ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) spectra of the TiO2 and TiO2-IL were conducted to detect their energy levels. The valence band (VB) level was calculated using eqn (4):36 VB = hv − (Ecutoff − Eonset)(4)Here, the cutoff binding energy (Ecutoff) and the onset binding energy (Eonset) value were determined from UPS, as shown in Fig. 3e. It is seen that the Ecutoff of TiO2 and TiO2-IL are estimated to be 16.67 eV and 16.76 eV, respectively, and their corresponding Eonset are 3.30 eV and 3.35 eV. Accordingly, the VB level of TiO2 and TiO2-IL were calculated to be −7.85 and −7.8 eV, and the conduction band (CB) level was located at −4.06 and −4.02 eV, respectively. Furthermore, the work function (WF) was counted by using eqn (5): WF = hv − Ecutoff(5)
The WF of TiO2 and TiO2-IL was derived to be −4.55 and −4.45 eV, respectively. The lower WF implies that the TiO2-IL layer has minority surface defects, and it likely generated a higher built-in potential (Vbi) which accelerated interfacial electron extraction and suppressed charge recombination.25,37 According to these findings, the energy level diagram of TiO2 and TiO2-IL were plotted in Fig. 3f. The BMIMHSO4 modifier tunes the band alignment to match the perovskite absorber level, shifting the CB upward and lowering the WF, resulting in accelerating charge extraction and transfer.38 After employing the BMIMHSO4 modifier, these beneficial effects were characterized, including a smoother TiO2 surface, a lower contact barrier, a more appropriate energy level, and enhanced mobility and conductivity.
Moreover, the effects of the BMIMHSO4 modifier for the perovskite film were investigated. The SEM images (top and cross-section views) of the perovskite films on the TiO2 and TiO2-IL layer are presented in Fig. 4a and b. The grain size distribution histograms of the perovskite film are displayed in Fig. S8.† The perovskite growing on TiO2 substrates shows smaller grains with an average size of ∼244 nm, a non-uniform morphology, and many pinholes at the top/cross-section, which are remarkably harmful to the PCE and stability due to defect states and non-radiative recombination.24 In contrast, after modification by BMIMHSO4, the perovskite film exhibits a higher quality, such as a larger average grain size of ∼458 nm, a compact and denser film, and lower defects. The significant variation in the perovskite film is attributed to the smoother and better wettability of the TiO2-IL layer. In addition, its cross-section image has particularly monolithic, large grains throughout the film, which are benefit to the longitudinal electron transport. These results demonstrate that the quality of the perovskite film could be improved by undergoing BMIMHSO4 modification from the chemical interaction, which could direct the anchoring of perovskite nucleation sites.39
 Fig. 4  SEM images from the top and cross-sectional views of the perovskite films on (a) TiO2 and (b) TiO2-IL; (c) the XRD analysis and (d) the UV-vis absorbance spectra of both perovskite films, with the inset displaying the band gap of the perovskite film. 

Fig. 4c shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the perovskite films on the TiO2 and TiO2-IL to study the crystalline properties. It is clearly observed that the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 14.4° (110), 28.4° (220), and 31.8° (310) are characteristic of the typical cubic phase of the crystalline structure of MAPbI3.40 Similar spectral characteristics reveal that the crystal structure of perovskite films on TiO2 and TiO2-IL exhibit no changes. The quantifiable α values relate well to the orientation of perovskite crystals. The α value of the perovskite film on the TiO2-IL substrate is 3.00, while that on the TiO2 substrate is 1.88. The larger α value indicates that BMIMHSO4 improved the perovskite crystallite and induced the vertical growth of perovskite, making it more conducive to charge transfer and extraction.41 In addition, the weaker peak intensity belongs to PbI2 for depositing on the TiO2-IL substrate, indicating that the Pb-related defects are effectively suppressed due to BMIMHSO4 and PbI2 interaction. The UV-vis absorption spectrum was utilized to examine the absorption capacity of the perovskite films. Fig. 4d depicts the absorption spectra of the perovskite film based on TiO2 and TiO2-IL. The absorbance for the perovskite film of TiO2-IL increased slightly, implying an improvement in the quality of the MAPbI3 film, which originates from the strong interactions between BMIMHSO4 and the perovskite component. The improved light absorption is beneficial for increasing the photogenerated current output and improving device performance. Further, the band gap of perovskite films from the absorbance curves were fitted by the Tauc plot method. The band gap values of the perovskite films were calculated to be 2.11 eV, indicating that the IL modification could not change the band gap of the perovskite films.
In order to verify the beneficial effect after the introduction of BMIMHSO4, the device structure FTO/TiO2/(BMIMHSO4)/MAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag was fabricated. The J–V characteristic curves of the various champion devices are displayed in Fig. 5a by using different BMIMHSO4 concentrations, and the photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table S2.† The photovoltaic parameters, including PCE, Voc, Jsc, and FF, improved dramatically when the BMIMHSO4 concentration increased to 2 mg ml−1. After that, the photovoltaic parameters undergo a reduction when the concentration is 5 mg ml−1. It is noted that the optimized PSCs achieved the highest PCE of 19.13%, with a Jsc of 23.56 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.09 V, and an FF of 74.21%, which are much higher than those of the PSCs without treatment (with a PCE of 15.92%, an Voc of 1.05 V, a Jsc of 22.82 mA cm−2, and a FF of 66.20%). The main reasons for the improvement of photovoltaic performance are as follows: (1) the reduced work function, outstanding electron mobility, and conductivity achieve minimum interfacial energy loss to improve the Voc. (2) The enhanced light harvest and vertical crystallite structure form a charge transport channel of photogenerated current to acquire a higher Jsc. (3) The high-quality perovskite film and lower surface trap sites decrease the non-radiation carrier recombination and lead to an improvement in the FF. Furthermore, twenty individual devices were fabricated to check the reproducibility and the photovoltaic parameter statistics distribution are shown in Fig. S9.† It is clear that the best performance is obtained with the 2 mg ml−1, along with a narrower and more concentrated distribution diagram compared to other devices. The reverse and forward scan J–V characteristic curves of the PSCs without treatment and 2 mg ml−1 BMIMHSO4 concentration were carried out to evaluate hysteresis. The following eqn (6) determines the hysteresis index of devices: (6)
 Fig. 5  (a) The J–V characteristic curves of the PSCs based on the TiO2-IL ETL at various solution concentrations and (b) typical J–V curves of both champion devices in opposite directions. 
The detailed photovoltaic parameters and hysteresis factor (H) are displayed in Table S3.† The J–V hysteresis ascribes unbalanced charge extractions and charge recombination/accumulation at the ETL (or HTL)/perovskite interfaces.42 The higher H value implies a more obvious hysteresis effect. It can be found that the device without BMIMHSO4 displays clear hysteresis and the H value reaches 8.70%, while the device with BMIMHSO4 exhibits negligible hysteresis and the H value is only 2.40%. The suppressed hysteresis of the BMIMHSO4-treated PSCs leads to the formation of a surface dipole and a high-quality perovskite film, which hinder carrier recombination and promote high-efficiency charge transfer. Further, the J–V hysteresis curves for twenty PSCs fabricated on TiO2 and the TiO2-IL layer are plotted in Fig. S10.† The modified PSCs exhibit a better photovoltaic performance, as evidenced by the modified PSCs exhibiting a lower hysteresis index and effective electron mobility and conductivity.
To further detect the reasons for photovoltaic parameter improvements, the charge carrier dynamics were analyzed by steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL). As shown in Fig. 6a, an obvious weakness in fluorescence intensity of the perovskite film on TiO2-IL can be observed, which is mostly related to quenching effects induced by quick charge transfer from the perovskite to the cathode.19 This demonstrates the superior quality of the perovskite film and good interface contact in containing with the BMIMHSO4-modified film. Meanwhile, compared with the perovskite film prepared on the TiO2 substrate, its PL peak exhibits a blue shift from 797 to 793 nm, implying that the perovskite film with BMIMHSO4 modification has fewer defects.35 Later, the corresponding TRPL spectra are displayed in Fig. 6b and fitted with the bi-exponential decay function (7). Y = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2)(7)where Ai is the amplitude components, t is the time constant, and τi is the decay components; the fitting results are summarized in Table S4.† We all know that the fast decay (τ1) is generated by carriers quenching at the ETL/perovskite interface, whereas the slow decay (τ2) is caused by charge carrier recombination due to bulk defects of the perovskite film.43 For perovskite deposited on the TiO2 substrates, the PL decay times are estimated to reach τ1 = 6.53 ns and τ2 = 212.79 ns. In comparison, when the BMIMHSO4 modifier was introduced into the TiO2/perovskite interface, τ1 and τ2 fell to 2.64 ns and 23.55 ns, respectively. The shorter fast lifetime indicates that photoluminescence is reduced the most. This illustrates that BMIMHSO4 could decrease non-radiative interfacial recombination and permit photogenerated charges to quickly transfer to the electrode.44 Moreover, the average PL decay times (τave) were estimated by eqn (8): (8)
 Fig. 6  (a) Steady PL spectra and (b) TRPL spectra of perovskite films deposited on TiO2 and TiO2 substrates (the light enters from perovskite film side); (c) dark J–V curves of an electron-only device in SCLC techniques with the inset displaying the device's architecture; (d) light intensity-dependent Voc; (e) the dark J–V characteristic curves; and (f) Nyquist plots, with the equivalent circuit model inset. 
The τave of the perovskite film on TiO2 substrate was calculated to be 187.86 ns; however, it is considerably lowered to 17.88 ns when the BMIMHSO4 layer was embedded. This shorter PL decay time is known to be useful for suppressing interfacial charge recombination and allowing for efficient electron extraction and injection at the perovskite/ETL interface,45,46 which is consistent with the matched work function and the strong electron mobility of TiO2-IL measured above.
The trap-state density in the perovskite absorber was also quantified by the widely used SCLC measurement for the electron-only devices. It is believed that the internal traps are continuously filled as the bias increases, and the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) was determined by all trap density levels. According to eqn (9), the electron trap (Ntraps) density was calculated. (9)Here, e is the elementary charge, L (∼450 nm) is the perovskite film thickness, ε (∼32) is the MAPbI3 relative dielectric constant, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, and VTFL is taken from the kink point.47,48 As shown in Fig. 6c, the VTFL of the perovskite films formed on the TiO2 and TiO2-IL surfaces is 0.475 V and 0.683 V, respectively. Accordingly, the computed results of Ntraps are listed in Table S5.† It can be found that the Ntraps of the perovskite film covered on TiO2 is 1.20 × 1014 cm−3, whereas the perovskite film on the TiO2-IL substrates has a lower Ntraps of 0.83 × 1014 cm−3. The lower trap density in the perovskite film of the TiO2-IL substrate reveals that the quality of the films has enhanced. Hence, the FF value achieved increased and improved the photovoltaic performance of the device.
According to the Voc response, carrier recombination in PSCs can also be examined at varied light intensities. It is widely acknowledged that the slope divergence of kT/q is directly connected to trap-assisted non-radiative recombination in PSCs. Normally, the Voc is proportional to the light intensity. Eqn (10) can be used to compute the diode ideal factor (n): (10)where K is the Boltzmann constant, T is the kelvin temperature, and q is the elementary charge.49 The TiO2-IL device has a slope of 1.46 KT/q, as seen in Fig. 6d, implying an effective suppression of trap-assisted non-radiation recombination. However, the device on the TiO2 layer displays a higher slope of 1.87 KT/q, indicating a significant energy loss by trap-assisted recombination. This smaller slope divergence after BMIMHSO4 modification of the layer further verifies the result that a reduced trap-state density in Fig. 6c allows for a decreased charge recombination and an improved FF performance. The energy loss and leakage current for the device were further monitored by implementing the dark J–V measurement. The reverse current density of the device on the TiO2-IL layer is lower compared to the device on the TiO2 substrate, as can be observed in Fig. 6e, revealing that the leakage current and energy loss in PSCs after the introduction of the BMIMHSO4 modification layer was greatly reduced under dark conditions.50,51 The decreased divided current exhibits a lower dependence of light intensity to illustrate fewer defects in the BMIMHSO4-modified PSCs.
In order to confirm the interfacial charge carrier transfer characteristic for our devices, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out. The Nyquist plots of the devices on the TiO2 layer and the TiO2-IL layer were evaluated in the dark. The high-frequency region of the EIS spectrum is recognized as the transfer resistance (Rrct), and the low-frequency part corresponds to the recombination resistance (Rs).32 In this study, the only distinction that pertains to the perovskite/ETL interface would be the influence of Rrct. The Nyquist plot is shown in Fig. 6f. The equivalent circuit model was employed to fit the result, and it is summarized in Table S6.† The device utilizing the TiO2-IL substrate exhibits an Rs of 22.31 Ω, while the TiO2-based device displays an increased Rs (30.48 Ω). Meanwhile, the Rrct of the device on the TiO2-IL film is 17704.03 Ω, compared with the device fabricated on the TiO2 substrate, being 12388.32 Ω, which is greatly increased. The fact that the lower Rs reveals a more efficient electron extraction and a higher Rrct indicates a more efficient suppression of TiO2/perovskite interfacial recombination, thus promoting the device performance.
Finally, since long-term stability is especially important for commercial applications, the stability of control and BMIMHSO4-modified PSCs was tested, and the normalized efficiency was presented in Fig. 7. After 600 h of atmosphere (∼40% RH, 25 ± 5 °C) exposure, the device with the BMIMHSO4 IL has a decreased deterioration rate, retaining 90% of the original PCE, while the control device on the TiO2 substrate deteriorated rapidly in terms of the PCE which was ∼60% initial value. Table S7† summarizes the stability research on BMIMHSO4 IL with other ILs. It is noted that, for us, the MAPbI3-PSCs are a preponderant comparison with others. This provides precise evidence that PSCs fabricated on the TiO2-IL layer have a remarkable operational stability, and further reveals that utilizing the IL modifier to increase device efficiency and stability is very feasible.

4. Conclusion
In summary, we provided a simple and efficient interface strategy by employing BMIMHSO4 IL into the TiO2/perovskite interface to obtain highly efficient and stabile MAPbI3-based PSCs assembled in open air atmosphere. BMIMHSO4 can lower the work function of the TiO2 ETL to achieve a perfect energy level arrangement with perovskite, facilitating interfacial electron extraction and transfer. In addition, BMIMHSO4 can passivate defects in the perovskite film, reducing charge trapping and recombination. Consequently, the highest PCE was 19.13%. Meanwhile, after 600 hours of exposure to the atmosphere, the BMIMHSO4 modified device exhibits admirable stability and retains 90% of the starting PCE. Therefore, this work provided an efficient approach to modify the ETL/perovskite interface by exploiting an IL modifier.
