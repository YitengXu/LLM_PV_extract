    , Accepted 10th October 2016First published on 10th October 2016AbstractHerein we prepare four novel D–π–A dyes based on triphenylamine (ZHG1, ZHG2, ZHG3 and ZHG4) by modifying the π-bridges. Compared with ZHG1, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ZHG2 is improved to 6.1% after the introduction of ethynyl. But further extension of the conjugation of the π-bridges by introducing the chromophore 4,8-bis(n-octyloxy)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) into ZHG3 conversely decreases the PCE to 4.6%. Improving the coplanarity by replacing cyclobenzene with thiophene in ZHG4 after introducing BDT further decreases the PCE of ZHG4 to 4.3%. Theoretical calculations indicate that the LUMOs of ZHG3 and ZHG4 were mainly delocalized over benzothiadiazole which is far from the anchoring groups. Cyclic voltammetry experiments indicate that the LUMO energy levels of ZHG3 and ZHG4 are lower than those of ZHG1 and ZHG2. Both of these results affect the ability to inject electrons into the TiO2 conduction band. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis shows that the mean thickness of the dye coverage for ZHG1, ZHG2, ZHG3 and ZHG4 is 16 Å, 18 Å, 27 Å and 24 Å, respectively. So the tilt angle of the dye backbone anchored on the TiO2 film is in the order of ZHG1 > ZHG2 > ZHG4 > ZHG3, which is consistent with the dye coverage of the outermost TiO2 surfaces. This result indicates that the intermolecular π–π aggregation in ZHG3 and ZHG4 with overlong π-bridges is more serious compared with that in ZHG1 and ZHG2. Perhaps the above two factors are the reason that the PCEs of ZHG3 and ZHG4 are lower than those of ZHG1 and ZHG2. So it is very important to find a balance point between the electron injection ability, intermolecular π–π aggregation and the expansion of the light absorption range.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted immense interest since the epoch-making breakthrough made by Grätzel and co-workers in 1991.1 During the past twenty years, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of DSSCs has made significant progress via numerous efforts. To date, the highest efficiency of DSSCs based on ruthenium-complexes and Zn porphyrins is 11.9% and 13%, respectively.2 But compared to these two kinds of dyes, metal-free pure organic dyes have attracted more and more attention in recent years due to their simple synthesis, flexible structural modulation and high molar extinction coefficients.3 In general, a typical push–pull organic dye comprises D–π–A structures. Donors in DSSCs include carbazole,4 triarylamine,5 diphenylamine,6 coumarin,7 phenoxazine,8 and indoline9 and acceptors anchored on TiO2 film are carboxylic acid,10 cyanoacrylic acid,11 pyridine,12 phosphonic acid,13 2-hydroxybenzonitrile,14 8-hydroxyquinoline15 and pyridine-N-oxide.16 Donors and acceptors are connected by π-bridges which are the key factor for efficient intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT),17 so modulation of the linkers is helpful for reducing the molecular energy gap and extending the absorption region to the near-infrared to improve the performance of DSSCs. General strategies for modifying the linkers include changing the π-conjugated extension18 and enhancing the rigidification of the π-bridges to reduce the rotational disorder.19
In this study, we have synthesized ZHG1, ZHG2, ZHG3 and ZHG4 (Fig. 1), four novel dyes based on modifying the π-bridges. We introduce long chains to noncoplanar triphenylamine because the long chains can suppress dye aggregation and conduction band charge recombination with its blocking effect and therefore improve the electron lifetime.20 Modification of the linkers is mainly based on the following considerations: (1) benzothiadiazole (BT) as an assistant electron-withdrawing unit in all four dyes is thought to facilitate intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and therefore improve the light-harvesting ability;21 (2) ethynyl is introduced to improve the rigidification of the conjugate linkers to reduce rotational disorder; (3) the excellent chromophore 4,8-bis(n-octyloxy)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) is adopted in the π-bridges to improve the conjugated extension for reducing the energy gap and therefore expanding the light absorption range; (4) heterocycles are generally thought to possess better conjugacy, so we employ thiophene in ZHG4 to replace the cyclobenzene of the dye ZHG3 adjoining anchor to improve its conjugacy.22 The different device performances caused by modification of the linkers are investigated with regards to the spectral and physicochemical properties of the sensitizers. The influence of dye coverage on the nanocrystalline TiO2-surface with different π-conjugated dyes is investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

Results and discussion
UV-Vis absorption properties
The synthetic routes and details are summarized in Scheme S1 (ESI†). The colour of ZHG1 is light red, ZHG2 is red, and ZHG3 and ZHG4 are both rufous. The gradually deepening color of the sensitizers visually reflects that extension of the π-bridges can expand the light absorption range of the dyes. Fig. 2a shows the UV-Vis absorption properties of ZHG dyes in THF with 1 μM concentration. From the corresponding spectral data summarized in Table 1, it can be observed that the main absorption of the dyes is from 456 nm to 491 nm which can be attributed to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) along with π–π* transition.23 Compared with dye ZHG1, the introduction of ethynyl between benzothiadiazole (BT) and cyclobenzene in ZHG2 leads to a 23 nm bathochromic shift. Insertion of chromophore BDT into ZHG3 and ZHG4 further leads to a 12 nm bathochromic shift compared with ZHG2, but replacing cyclobenzene with thiophene in ZHG4 just produces a small effect on the absorption spectrum. The molar molecular extinction coefficient of ZHG1, ZHG2, ZHG3 and ZHG4 is 1.74 × 104, 2.12 × 104, 3.91 × 104 and 4.96 × 104 M−1 cm−1, respectively. The aforementioned bathochromic and hyperchromic shift can be attributed to the enhancing rigidification of the conjugate linkers and an extending π-conjugated extension. The UV-Vis absorption of dyes anchored on 12 μm thick nanocrystalline TiO2 film (particle size, 20 nm) is also investigated. From Fig. 2b, it can be observed that the absorption ranges of sensitizers in the low-energy region on the film are larger than those in THF solutions. The 8 nm and 5 nm blue-shift of ZHG1 and ZHG2 anchored on TiO2 could be ascribed to deprotonation of the carboxylic acid or the H-aggregates. In contrast, ZHG3 and ZHG4 anchored on TiO2 both lead to a 7 nm red-shift. This red-shift could be ascribed to the J-aggregates because the π-bridges of ZHG3 and ZHG4 are much longer than those of ZHG1 and ZHG2.24

Electrochemical properties
For evaluation of the possibility of electron transfer from the excited dye molecule to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 and the ability for dye regeneration, we use cyclic voltammetry to determine the redox potential of dyes in THF as shown in Fig. 3 and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. The ground state oxidation potentials of ZHG1, ZHG2, ZHG3 and ZHG4 are 1.23, 1.25, 1.22 and 1.22 V vs. NHE, respectively, which are efficient driving forces for regeneration in I−/I3− electrolyte (0.45 V vs. NHE). The excited-state oxidation potentials deriving from the energy gap E0–0 and ground state oxidation potentials are −1.03, −0.91, −0.84 and −0.84 V vs. NHE, respectively.25 As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), these calculated values are all sufficiently more negative than the energy level of the TiO2 conduction band (−0.5 V vs. NHE), ensuring enough power to inject the electron to the TiO2 conduction band. It can be observed that the elevated rigidification and the extension linkers have more influence on the LUMOs of sensitizers. This kind of phenomenon gives us more enlightenment on tuning the LUMO levels in future novel organic dyes.

Theoretical calculations
In order to gain insight into the distribution of the frontier molecular orbitals and the dye molecular structures, density functional theory (DFT) studies are carried out at the DFT-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level with the Gaussian 09 suite of programs. From Fig. S2 (ESI†), it can be observed that the HOMO of ZHG1 is mainly delocalized between triphenylamine and benzothiadiazole. The HOMOs of ZHG2, ZHG3 and ZHG4 extend to ethynyl and the chromophore BDT moiety, respectively. The LUMOs of the dyes are all delocalized between benzothiadiazole and the acceptors. In general, the excellent overlap of the HOMOs and the LUMOs in all the dyes is helpful for transferring the electron from the donors to the acceptors,26 but at the same time it will prompt recombination of the excited electrons back to the donor subunits. So this kind of excellent overlap of the HOMOs and the LUMOs is actually a double-edged sword for the device performance. This phenomenon means that finding a balance point between excellent overlap of the HOMOs and the LUMOs and good charge-separation states will be very important in the future designing of new dyes. Compared with ZHG1 and ZHG2, the LUMOs of ZHG3 and ZHG4 are mainly delocalized over benzothiadiazole which is far from the anchoring groups, and it may be harmful for electron injection into the TiO2 conduction band and may affect the device performances based on ZHG3 and ZHG4.
Photovoltaic performance
Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) based on ZHG dyes with I−/I3− electrolyte under AM 1.5 full sunlight (100 mW cm−2) illumination are shown in Fig. 4. From the corresponding data summarized in Table 2, it can be observed that tuning the π-bridges can produce an apparent influence on the DSSC performances. Compared with ZHG1, the power conversion efficiency of ZHG2 is improved to 6.1% after the introduction of ethynyl. The Voc of ZHG2 is similar to that of ZHG1, but the Jsc of ZHG2 is obviously larger than that of ZHG1. Thus the introduction of ethynyl to ZHG2 leads to a broader wavelength range of IPCE (Fig. 4a) and a higher Jsc value which eventually improves the overall efficiency. The superior performance of the dye ZHG2 prompts us to further extend the conjugation of the π-bridge by introducing the chromophore BDT in order to gain better results, but unfortunately the cell performance reduces to 4.68% when the BDT is introduced to the dye ZHG3. We speculate that although the introduction of BDT can further extend the absorption range, the dihedral angle of up to 23.83° between BDT and cyclobenzene might suppress the intramolecular charge transfer effects because of their overlong linkers.27 The Jsc of ZHG1, ZHG2, ZHG3 and ZHG4 is 11.4, 12.0, 9.85 and 9.89 mA cm−2, respectively. ZHG2 has a higher Jsc than ZHG1 due to its broader wavelength range of IPCE as shown in Fig. 4a. The IPCE wavelength range of ZHG2 is extended to 650 nm which is higher compared with that of ZHG1 (625 nm). Their maximum IPCE values both reach 80%. The IPCE wavelength ranges of ZHG3 and ZHG4 are further extended to 665 nm due to the introduction of BDT. Their maximum IPCE values just reach 68%, much lower than those of ZHG2 from 300 nm to 560 nm, so they exhibit relatively lower current density. The Jsc values from the IPCE curves are 9.3, 10.1, 8.5, and 9.0 mA cm−2, respectively. The differences from the experimental results are probably due to the slight spectral mismatch but the order is in line with that from the J–V curves.

In order to gain insight into the open circuit voltage properties, we investigate the electron recombination effect of the cell devices using electrochemical impedance measurements in the dark under a bias (−0.7 V).28 The equivalent circuit, and the fitted and experimental results are shown in Fig. 5a.29 The larger semicircle of the Nyquist plot in the high frequency region corresponds to the charge recombination resistance (Rrec) at the photoanode/dye/electrolyte interface. The smaller semicircle corresponds to electron transport at the Pt/electrolyte. From Fig. 5a, we can see that the charge recombination resistance (Rrec) of the photoanode/dye/electrolyte interface increases in the order of ZHG2 > ZHG1 > ZHG3 > ZHG4. This is consistent with the order of the open circuit voltage. We also calculate the life times using τ = 1/(2πf) from the Bode phase plots shown in Fig. 5b.30 The f values of ZHG1, ZHG2, ZHG3 and ZHG4 are 5.27 Hz, 5.03 Hz, 5.62 Hz and 6.42 Hz as shown in the Bode phase plots. So the electron lifetime should be 30.21 ms, 31.65 ms, 28.33 ms and 24.80 ms, respectively. Because the longer lifetime means that the current in the dark of the DSSC is lower, the lifetime values are also in line with the order of the Voc values.

Surface adsorption properties
The adsorption capacities of ZHG1, ZHG2, ZHG3 and ZHG4 dyes covered on TiO2 film are 1.32 × 10−6, 1.42 × 10−6, 1.56 × 10−6 and 1.57 × 10−6 mol cm−2 as shown in Table 3.31 If the capacity of ZHG1 is set to 1, the relative value of ZHG2, ZHG3 and ZHG4 is 1.08, 1.18 and 1.19, respectively. In order to gain insight into this kind of adsorption property, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is used to study the TiO2 surfaces. XPS is a powerful technique to study surface properties because it can provide molecular structures, atomic valence state information, elemental composition, the content of various compounds and chemical bond information. In addition the X-ray beam is a photon beam which produces little damage to the samples. So XPS is well suited for studying the dye-sensitized surfaces.32

We measure the relative adsorption amounts of ZHG dyes anchored on TiO2 with XPS by comparing the intensity of the N1s core level and the Ti2p3/2 level. Fig. 6a shows the N1s spectra at a binding energy of 398.13 eV normalized versus the corresponding Ti2p3/2 signal. From the data summarized in Table 3, we can see that if the N1s intensity of ZHG1 is set to 1, the relative adsorption amount of ZHG2, ZHG3 and ZHG4 is 1.06, 1.84 and 1.76 respectively. XPS is a sensitive surface analysis technique which can accurately determine the dye coverage of the outermost surface. However dye desorption measurements can determine the dye coverage of the entire TiO2 film. So the relative values measured by the aforementioned two methods are not strictly consistent, but in general π-conjugated extension indeed leads to an increase in dye coverage. In order to understand this phenomenon we measure the mean thickness (d) of the dye coverage by comparing the Ti2p3/2 intensity (I) damping of the TiO2 film anchored by the corresponding dyes with the intensity (I0) damping of blank TiO2 film as summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). From Fig. 6b, we can see that the Ti2p3/2 intensity of TiO2 anchored by dyes is lower than that of the blank TiO2 film, especially for the dyes with n-octyl π-bridges. If the dye layers are homogeneous and all TiO2 films only contain small amounts of contaminants, the mean thickness (d) can be measured by a two-layer model, I/I0 = exp(−d/λsinα), where λ is the inelastic mean free path (IMFP) of electrons in dye molecules, and α is the electron take-off angle of 45°. The IMFP of ZHG1, ZHG2, ZHG3 and ZHG4 is 29.99 Å, 29.89 Å, 29.93 Å and 28.47 Å, respectively.33 So the mean thickness of the dye coverage for ZHG1, ZHG2, ZHG3 and ZHG4 is 16 Å, 18 Å, 27 Å and 24 Å, respectively. We conclude on consideration of the molecular size that the tilt angle of the dye backbone anchored on the TiO2 film is in the order of ZHG1 > ZHG2 > ZHG4 > ZHG3 which is consistent with the dye coverage of the outermost TiO2 surfaces. Perhaps this is the reason that overlong π-bridge dyes intensify the intermolecular π–π aggregation effects in our ZHG dye systems.

Conclusions
Herein we prepare four new D–π–A dyes by modifying the π-bridges. We discover that the appropriate extension of linkers can effectively improve the PCE of dye ZHG2 compared with ZHG1, but overlong linkers in ZHG3 and ZHG4 will conversely reduce the PCE of the DSSCs. Theoretical calculations indicate that the LUMOs of ZHG3 and ZHG4 are mainly delocalized over benzothiadiazole which is far from the anchoring groups. Cyclic voltammetry experiments indicate that the LUMO energy levels of ZHG3 and ZHG4 are lower than those of ZHG1 and ZHG2. These results both affect the ability for injection of electrons into the TiO2 conduction band. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) shows that the tilt angles of the dye backbones anchored on the TiO2 film are in the order of ZHG1 > ZHG2 > ZHG4 > ZHG3, which is consistent with the dye coverage of the outermost TiO2 surfaces. This result indicates that the intermolecular π–π aggregation in ZHG3 and ZHG4 with overlong π-bridges is more serious compared with that in ZHG1 and ZHG2. Perhaps the above two factors are the reason that the PCEs of ZHG3 and ZHG4 are lower than those of ZHG1 and ZHG2. So finding a balance point between the electron injection ability, intermolecular π–π aggregation and the expansion of the light absorption range will be very important. More important is that this result can provide some enlightenment for the future research of the structure–activity relationship of dyes.
