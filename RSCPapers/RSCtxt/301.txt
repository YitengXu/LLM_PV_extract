    , Accepted 25th February 2019First published on 25th February 2019AbstractThe direct conversion of CO2 to syngas with controllable composition remains an intense interest for the production of renewable fuels. Large current density and high cell voltage efficiency are critical from a practical viewpoint for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CRR), while the design of catalysts is a great challenge. Here, we report oxide-derived Cu nanowires with abundant, highly dispersed two-phase CuO heterostructures for syngas generation. The specified H2/CO ratios of 1, 2 and 3, with extra high CRR faradic (90%) and energetic (50%) efficiencies, were achieved. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the misfit dislocation sites in the electrocatalyst break the inherent scaling relationship of CRR intermediates' adsorption energies with an extraordinarily strong adsorption of *COOH and consequently promote excellent activity of the catalyst toward CRR. Driven by a commercial solar cell (working voltage of 2.2 V) under direct sunlight, the freestanding electrocatalyst can steadily generate syngas of the desired composition using CO2 as a feedstock.
Introduction
Electrochemical conversion of CO2 into fuels and chemicals is a promising strategy for high-density renewable energy storage. But, because of the high reaction barrier and inevitable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) competition, the CO2 reduction reaction (CRR) to carbonaceous products is slow and needs a high overpotential to proceed.1,2 These two issues largely restrain the possibility of coupling the electrochemical conversion of CO2 with some renewable energy input, such as solar cells, to deliver an acceptable cell voltage efficiency. Apparently, a high energy efficiency (E.E., collectively determined by a low overpotential and a high faradaic efficiency, F.E.) and large partial current density for a certain product are the paramount parameters for practical operation of electrochemical CO2 conversion.3 The design of highly active and selective electrocatalysts for CRR is critical to achieve these targets but remains challenging.4
CO is one of the most common and important products of CO2 reduction. By coupling it with water splitting, an electrochemical co-production of H2 and CO is achievable via a combination of HER and CRR processes. Various types of syngas with tunable H2/CO ratio (e.g., 1, 2, and 3) are key feedstock components for industrial-scale production of liquid fuels and chemicals. Currently, syngas is most often generated by steam reforming of natural gas, which has a large carbon footprint. Limited success has been achieved toward clean syngas production associated with renewable energy and using abundant CO2 as a feedstock.5–11 One of the most important reasons is that E.E. of electrocatalytic CRR is still unsatisfactory. So far, a range of highly selective electrocatalysts for conversion of CO2 to CO, with F.E. exceeding 90%, and active HER electrocatalysts have been developed individually.12–14 However, to achieve a tunable H2/CO ratio, a delicate balance between CRR and HER on one surface is essential. A possible solution is the rational design of electrocatalysts with one (or two) appropriate catalytic site(s) for generation of a series of key reaction intermediates of CRR and HER.15 Moreover, to achieve high E.E. and high current density simultaneously to make production feasible, a well-designed physical structure of the electrocatalyst with a sufficient number of exposed active sites is indispensable.
Currently, metallic Cu is the most well understood electrocatalyst for CRR, from both experimental and theoretical viewpoints.16 Also, Cu can generate CO and H2 coherently at different rates, depending on the applied potentials.1 However, other carbonaceous products (ethylene, methane, formate, etc.) are also generated under the same potentials, yielding a maximum CO F.E. of ∼40% (excluding H2).1 From an experimental viewpoint, it has proven difficult to increase the CO selectivity on a single Cu site due to the inherent scaling of adsorption energies for different intermediates (*COOH, *CO, *CHO, etc.).12 This scaling relationship also fundamentally limits the activity of an electrocatalyst (in terms of the overpotential for generation of one type of species) to reach the theoretical maximum value.17 As a result, even though substantial progress has been made to develop Cu-based electrocatalysts for efficient CRR, a large negative potential (e.g., −0.6 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) is still needed to achieve a favorable CO F.E. (for instance >80%).18–21 Therefore, high overall F.E. and, more importantly, high E.E. for CO generation is still challenging. Although some precious metal electrocatalysts with relatively weak *CO intermediate adsorption can produce gaseous CO with F.E. exceeding 90% at low overpotentials, the HER rates on these surfaces are always slow due to the very weak *H intermediate adsorption. An electrocatalyst for high performance syngas production is still required for practical applications.
Here, we propose an atomically dispersed heterostructure of CuO on freestanding Cu nanowires (Cu NWs) as a highly effective electrocatalyst for CO2 conversion to syngas due to extraordinarily strong adsorption of reaction intermediate *COOH on its surface. Consequently, fast kinetic CO generation with low overpotential and high partial current density were achieved on the misfit dislocation sites present on the surface of Cu NWs. By subtly tuning the water splitting reaction rate on this electrocatalyst, the desired composition of syngas (with the H2/CO ratio of 1, 2 or 3) can be achieved with very high energetic efficiency of ∼50% as well as high current density of ∼5.0 mA cm−2 at low overpotential, outperforming most reported Cu-family electrocatalysts. For the first time, by combining this electrocatalytic system with a commercial solar cell panel (working voltage of 2.2 V) and using CO2 as a feedstock, a stable rate of ∼7 μmol min−1 gcatal−1 of H2/CO = 2 syngas can be generated under direct sunlight illumination.
Results and discussion
Structure characterization
The highly crystalline Cu nanowires (Cu NWs) were synthesized via a reduction method in aqueous phase.22 The freshly produced Cu NWs were subjected to continuous air-oxidation under ambient conditions, high temperature oxidation (300–400 °C), and then in situ electrochemical reduction under aqueous conditions (Fig. 1a and S1†). As compared to pristine Cu, the samples reduced at different temperatures (300, 350 and 400 °C), denoted as r-Cuox(300), r-Cuox(350) and r-Cuox(400), respectively, show similar rod-like morphology but with abundant outgrowths on their surfaces (Fig. 1b and c and S2a and b†). These outgrowths may be formed due to water molecules adsorbed from air during the first oxidization process etching the surface of Cu NWs during the second high temperature oxidization process. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles (Fig. 1d) show that pristine Cu has a clear face-centered cubic (f.c.c.) crystal structure, while r-Cuox(350) shows both cubic phase CuO (c-CuO) and monoclinic CuO (m-CuO) phase in the structure, in addition to metallic Cu. These results are also consistent with those of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) and synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) data, which are more surface sensitive. The high resolution XPS spectrum of r-Cuox(350) shows more Cu2+ species than that of pristine Cu (Fig. 1e). The XANES spectra also show that there is an obvious energy shift to the higher energy (i.e., higher valance) states of Cu K-edge in r-Cuox(350) in comparison to pristine Cu (Fig. 1f). Moreover, the Fourier transform r-space of extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) shows that, in addition to the Cu–Cu main peak, there exists a certain amount of Cu–O species on the r-Cuox(350) surface (Fig. 1g). The fitting results also show the coordination number of Cu in r-Cuox(350) to be lower than those in the pristine Cu and Cu foil references (Table S1†).

Heterostructure identification
As can be seen from the scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image (Fig. S3†), there are some outgrowths on the surface of r-Cuox(350). The corresponding elemental mapping indicates that there are some oxygen species in these structures. In the low-magnification TEM image, each Cu NW is covered by a thick shell with irregular outgrowths (Fig. 2a inset). The electron diffraction pattern allows an explicit identification of the polycrystalline nature of the shell enclosure, whose radially integrated profile can be perfectly indexed by m-CuO, c-CuO and bulk Cu phases, as also observed by XRD and XPS analysis (Fig. 2b). A high-resolution TEM image provides the atomic level structure of the outer polycrystalline shell, which is made of mixed CuO domains with different crystal structures and orientations (Fig. 2a). Specifically, an m-CuO domain with rhombic lattice (shown by the green dashed rectangle in panel (a)) can be identified on the HRTEM image and the indexed FFT along its [010] direction, where two reciprocal vectors [002]* and [200]* have an angle of ∼81° (Fig. 2c–e). Another domain with a square lattice (shown by the yellow dashed rectangle in panel (a)) can be similarly identified as c-CuO structure, which is a metastable phase with a face-centred lattice (Fig. 2f–h). It should be noted that the c-CuO structure has a very similar cell to a previously reported Cu2O phase.23–25 However, the absence of (110) reflections in the FFT, arising from the face-centering of the c-CuO structure, allows us to exclude the Cu2O structure (Fig. 2g), in which the oxygen sublattice breaks such lattice-centering. Interestingly, the intergrown domains of m-CuO and c-CuO heterostructures with an orientation relationship of {001}〈010〉c-CuO//{001}〈010〉m-CuO are visible (shown in the red dashed rectangles in panel (a)) where two sets of reflections are superimposed in the FFT, as shown in Fig. 2j. These two types of nanometer-sized domains are highly strained and interpenetrated, with misfit dislocations formed at the interfaces of the heterostructures (see the interfacial structural model as shown in Fig. 2k). One can speculate that the intergrown m-CuO/c-CuO heterostructure may originate from the phase transition between these two structures during the oxidation–reduction processes of r-Cuox(350).

Evaluation of electrochemical properties
A three-electrode cell configuration was set up to investigate the role of the aforementioned oxide species in the Cuox samples for CRR performance. As expected, all freshly reduced electrodes show slightly higher overall current density and lower overpotential than pristine Cu (Fig. 3a and S4a†). Additionally, the reduced samples with oxide species show higher F.E. of carbonaceous products (mainly CO) than the pristine one (Fig. 3b and S4–S6†). Taking the best performing r-Cuox(350) as an example, CO starts to generate at as low as −0.30 V vs. RHE (∼0.20 V overpotential) and reaches a maximum F.E. of 48% at −0.49 V vs. RHE (Fig. 3b). These values are better than those for most reported Cu-based CO generating electrocatalysts.21,24,26–28 In contrast, the F.E. of CO on pristine Cu was lower than 10%, with very strong HER competition through the entire testing range (Fig. S5†). Note that for the r-Cuox(350) electrode, H2 and CO are the major gaseous products detected in the range of −0.15 to −0.70 V (see Fig. 3b). There are also some C2H4 and C2H6 species confirmed as impurities from CO2 reactant. The liquid product contains a small amount of HCOO− and no deep reduction products are detected, e.g., C2H5OH. The double layer capacitance (DLC) obtained by cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to evaluate the electrochemically active surface area. Fig. S7† shows the CVs of the pristine Cu, r-Cuox(300), r-Cuox(350) and r-Cuox(400) catalysts in the potential range, in which faradaic processes are not occurring in 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte. According to the approximate linear relationship of the geometric current density against the CV scan rate, the pristine Cu, r-Cuox(300), r-Cuox(350) and r-Cuox(400) show capacitances of 34.25, 81.65, 102.50 and 84.35 mF cm−2, respectively. Among the samples, r-Cuox(350) has the maximum capacitance, which may contribute in part to its best performance.

(b) F.E. of CO, H2 and HCOOH products as a function of potential for r-Cuox(350). (c) Molar rate of H2 to CO products as a function of potential for r-Cuox(350). (d) E.E. of CO, H2 and overall products as a function of potential for r-Cuox(350). 
Interestingly, the molar ratio of H2 to CO depends strongly on the applied potential and can be controlled exactly from 3 to 1 (Fig. 3c). For example, at an applied potential of −0.39 V vs. RHE (i.e., overpotentials of 0.28 V and 0.39 V for CO and H2 generation, respectively), r-Cuox(350) delivers very high current density (∼5.0 mA cm−2) with the precise molar ratio of H2/CO = 2.0 that is well suited for direct methanol synthesis. Importantly, the overall E.E. for the entire range of syngas mixtures is always ∼50% due to the low generation overpotentials and high F.E. (Fig. 3d). These exceptional E.E. and cathodic current density values of the newly developed r-Cuox(350), as the two key indexes for the aforementioned industrial application of CO2 conversion technology, are much higher than those reported for other Cu-based CRR electrocatalysts for various types of syngas generation (Fig. S8 and Table S2†).5,9–11,18,20,24,27,28
Catalytic mechanisms
It is well known that the reduction of CuO, either in situ or ex situ, can introduce a range of different types of defects on the lattice of derived Cu (e.g., grain boundaries) which are electrocatalytically active for CO2 and CO reductions.21,24,29,30 We also noticed a distinctive OH− adsorption behavior compared to pristine Cu. As shown in Fig. 4a, in addition to regular redox peaks from facets of metallic Cu itself, there is an extra shoulder on the r-Cuox(350) surface under negative potentials, which indicates stronger OH− interactions in the case of the r-Cuox(350) surface compared to pristine Cu.21 We attribute these features to the presence of oxide species in r-Cuox(350). The stronger OH− interactions on r-Cuox(350) can not only surpass the competing HER due to increased local pH value slowing the kinetics of the first water reduction step (the Volmer step),31 but can also increase the kinetics of CRR by enhancing the adsorption ability of the *COOH reaction intermediate.32

(a) CVs of r-Cuox(350) and pristine Cu catalysts in N2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution; arrows show adsorption of additional OH-species. (b) Partial current of CO and H2 as a function of potential for r-Cuox(350) catalyst. (c, d) Partial current of CO and H2 for r-Cuox(350) catalyst under different concentrations of CO2-saturated KHCO3 solution. 
Interestingly, for r-Cuox(350) electrocatalyst under CRR conditions, the partial current of hydrogen generation increases constantly with increasing overpotential, while the CO generation reaches a plateau at a certain overpotential (Fig. 4b and c). This can be explained by the limited CO2 mass transport in the electrolyte at high CO generation rates.6 Consequently, the appropriate HER and CRR rates deliver a controllable molar ratio of H2 and CO to form various types of syngas under different potentials (Fig. 3c). More importantly, there is still a strong diffusion-limiting current for CO generation with increasing concentration of KHCO3 electrolyte (Fig. 4c), further indicating an excellent rate of CO2 reduction to CO. Also, the CO generation rate on r-Cuox(350) decreases with increasing HCO3− concentration (Fig. 4c and S9†). This is partly attributed to the rate change of competing HER, but, more importantly, can mostly be explained from the mechanistic perspective.33 It is known that the initial proton donation for CO2 reduction originates from HCO3− in the solution; dependence of the HCO3− concentration on the reaction rate indicates that the hydrogenation step is the rate determining step (RDS), while an independent trend indicates that the single electron transfer to CO2 is the RDS.34,35 A very small or even negative rate order of HCO3− toward CO formation on r-Cuox(350) indicates that electron transfer to CO2 is the RDS, which is consistent with other very active and selective CO generation materials, like Au and Ag, in which the rate value is close to zero.36,37
Origin of heterostructure activity
To explain the origin of the exceptional CRR activity of the r-Cuox(350) surface at the atomic level, reaction free energy diagrams of CO and H2 evolution were obtained for different structures (Fig. 5a and b). Crystallographic planes for the investigated models (m-CuO(010), c-CuO(001), and CuO-heterostructure, as shown in Fig. S10†) were selected based on the experimental HRTEM results outlined in Fig. 2. The Cu(111) surface was also considered, to simulate pristine Cu for the purpose of comparison (Fig. S11†). As shown in Fig. S11–S14,† CO2 molecules chemisorb at the heterojunction of m-CuO and c-CuO with an adsorption energy of −0.45 eV, much more negative than those on the Cu(111) and c-CuO surfaces. Due to the experimental evidence that the initial electron transfer is the RDS for CRR, strong CO2 adsorption may benefit the subsequent activation and reduction processes. For the CRR pathway, the CuO-heterostructure is the most energetically favorable among all four surfaces, with free energy of 0.31 eV for CO2 progression to *COOH intermediate state (Fig. 5a and S15–S18†). The only other thermodynamically uphill step (0.26 eV free energy change) on this surface is desorption of *CO to gaseous CO product. In contrast, the Cu(111) surface shows the best theoretical HER activity, due to its smallest hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔGH) value (Fig. 5b and S19†); all CuO structures possess stronger hydrogen adsorption abilities, leading to worse HER selectivity. These theoretical considerations are in good agreement with experimental observation that the HER rates on the synthesized r-Cuox samples with oxide species are much lower than that on pristine Cu (Fig. 3b and S8†).

The black line is a guide to show the scaling relationship. (d) Side view of *COOH and *CO adsorption configurations at the heterojunction of CuO-heterostructure. 
The underlying reason for the CuO-heterostructure possessing greatly enhanced CRR activity (in terms of limiting potential) toward CO product is that the intrinsic scaling relationship between *COOH and *CO reaction intermediates' adsorption energies is broken. As shown in Fig. 5a, the overall activity of the CO2 reduction to CO is thermodynamically controlled by the free energy changes of three steps: *COOH formation, *CO formation and *CO desorption. There is a well-known linear scaling relationship between the adsorption energies of *COOH and *CO on a range of metal surfaces, identified in Fig. 5c as a 2D volcano-shaped activity map. As can be clearly seen, this inherent scaling relationship limits the pure metal materials from the activity peak (the deep red area in Fig. 5c).38–41 However, for the interface of CuO-heterostructure, it is easier to reach the volcano peak by deviating from the linear relationship with a stronger *COOH adsorption and similar *CO adsorption, as in the case of the Cu(111) surface. This enhanced *COOH adsorption on the CuO-heterostructure can be attributed to two forming bonds: the common carbon–copper bond and the oxygen–copper bond (Fig. 5d). For *CO adsorption, only one carbon–copper bond is identified, similar to the Cu(111) surface (Fig. 5d).
Syngas generation from solar energy
To simulate real application of CO2 conversion, a two-electrode cell was set up by applying RuO2-coated Ti electrode and free standing r-Cuox(350) membrane electrode as the anode and cathode, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6a, syngas generation starts at a cell voltage of 1.6 V (without iR-free correction) and can reach a current of 2.5 mA at a voltage of 2.2 V. Under such conditions, the syngas generation rate was ∼7 μmol min−1 gcatal−1 with a H2/CO ratio of 2 (Fig. 6a and S20†). This production ratio can last at least 18 h (Fig. 6b and c and S21†), showing the outstanding stability of both materials and generation rate. Similar to the three-electrode system, adjusting the cell voltage can also tune the H2/CO ratio in gas products (Fig. 6a inset). Ultimately, CRR powered by a renewable energy source such as the sun is ideal, but requires a small enough CRR overpotential and high enough F.E. of products.42–44 As shown in Fig. 6d, the amount of syngas (H2/CO ratio of 2) constantly increases with electrolysis time for a two-electrode cell driven by a commercial solar-energy battery (working voltage of 2.2 V); ∼0.34 mL syngas was collected over 30 min. Also, the H2/CO evolution ratio can be controlled by applying different types of solar-energy batteries with various output voltages (Fig. S22†).

Conclusions
In conclusion, the oxide-derived Cu electrocatalyst demonstrates controllable syngas production via CO2 reduction with high energetic efficiency, high current density and outstanding stability. These features ultimately guarantee a high rate of syngas generation driven by commercial solar cells. Analysis of energetics indicates that the exceptional activity originates from a unique heterostructure at the interface of highly strained and interpenetrated m-CuO and c-CuO domains on the shell of Cu NWs. Enhanced *COOH adsorption on these sites breaks the inherent linear scaling relationship of a series of reaction intermediates' adsorption energies normally present on conventional metal surfaces. The tuning of heterostructure to break the scaling relationship holds promise for the development of more efficient (electro)catalysts for broader applications. Also, combining highly efficient electrocatalysts for CO2 conversion with commercial renewable energy devices reveals a path toward next-generation syngas production.
Methods
Preparation of Cu NWs
Typically, NaOH (200 mL, 15 M), Cu(NO3)2 (10 mL, 0.1 M), ethylenediamine (EDA, 1.5 mL), and hydrazine (0.75 mL, 35 wt%) were added to a 500 mL round bottom flask. The mixture was shaken by hand for 15 seconds then heated at 80 °C and stirred at 180 rpm for approximately 45 minutes. Afterward, Cu NWs formed and floated to the top of the solution. After washing with distilled water and ethanol several times, Cu NWs were collected.
Fabrication of the freestanding CuNW membrane electrode for CO2 reduction
A certain volume of CuNW aqueous dispersion was filtered under reduced pressure within 5 min to form the freestanding membrane with dimensions of 1.8 cm. Afterward, the CuNW membrane was subject to air oxidation in a tubular furnace under static air conditions for 4 days and then was annealed at different temperatures (from 300 to 400 °C) for 1.5 h. Before testing, the oxidized CuNW membrane was electrochemically reduced at −1.3 V in N2-saturated KHCO3 electrolyte and then directly used as cathode for CO2 reduction. The reduced catalysts were characterized immediately and stored in a vacuum bag to avoid air oxidation.
Physicochemical characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained by a field emission scanning electron microanalyzer (JEOL-6700F). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained by an XD-3 X-ray diffractometer. An X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, ESCALab MKII) was used to obtain the X-ray photoelectron spectra. The XAS spectra were recorded in transmission mode (Si 111) at the BL14W1 End station of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). The electron beam energy of the storage ring was 3.5 GeV with a maximum stored current of 300 mA. The data were normalized and analyzed using Athena. Low resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted on a FEI Tecnai-G2 at an acceleration voltage of 120 kV. High-angle annular dark-field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images were recorded by a FEI Titan G2 60-300 microscope equipped with a Cs probe corrector at 300 kV.
Electrocatalytic activities of the membrane electrodes for CO2 reduction
Both three-electrode and two-electrode systems were used to measure the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction activity of different membrane electrodes. All electrochemical experiments were performed in a H-type electrochemical cell with two compartments separated by a Nafion 117 membrane.2,3 Each compartment had 50 mL of electrolyte (0.1 M KHCO3) and around 50 mL headspace. The measurements were carried out using a CHI760D electrochemical workstation at room temperature. In the conventional three-electrode system, a Pt plate and Ag/AgCl in saturated KCl were used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The in situ reduced freestanding CuNW membrane was directly used as a working electrode. In the two-electrode system, the CuNW membrane and RuO2-coated Ti electrode were used as cathode and anode, respectively. Before testing, the cathodic compartment of the cell was degassed and saturated with high-purity CO2 (99.9999%, BOC Gas) at 40 mL min−1 for at least 20 min. During the reduction process, CO2 gas was continuously bubbled into the cathodic chamber at a rate of 40 mL min−1. All potentials were tested against an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and converted to the RHE reference scale.
Determination of samples
The gas samples were delivered directly to the sampling loop of an on-line gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with two channels. In the first analysis cycle, CO and CH4 were detected by Porapak Q and TDX-01 columns with a flame ionization detector (FID); H2 and CO2 were detected by TDX-01 column with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) using Ar as a carrier gas. In the second analysis cycle, CH4, C2H4, C2H6 and C2H2 were detected by a Porapak N column with a FID detector. The liquid products were measured by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR, Bruker 400 MHz).
Computation methods and models
Spin polarized electronic structure calculations were carried out by DFT framework with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlation functional using a projector augmented-wave method in the VASP code.45–48 For the plane-wave expansion, a 550 eV kinetic energy cut-off was used after testing a series of different energy values. The convergence criterion for electronic structure iteration was set at 10−5 eV and that for geometry optimization was set at 0.01 eV Å−1. For large supercell computations, the convergence criterion was set at 5 × 10−5 eV for electronic structure and 0.05 eV Å−1 for geometry. A Gaussian smearing of 0.20 eV was applied during the geometry optimization and for the total energy computation. The K-points were set to be 3 × 3 × 1 for Cu(111), 4 × 4 × 1 for cubic-CuO(001), 2 × 2 × 1 for monoclinic-CuO(010), and 1 × 3 × 1 for CuO-heterostructure(010), all using Monkhorst–Pack grids except for the monoclinic structure, which used gamma centred grids. Detailed model parameters are provided in ESI.† The Tkatchenko–Scheffler method was applied during all calculations to properly address the van der Waals interactions between atoms.
Free energy diagram computation
The computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model was applied to define the energy of a proton–electron pair at 0 V vs. RHE, which is 1/2 of the H2 free energy at 101.325 kPa. The free energy diagrams are all plotted under this electrode potential. The free energies of adsorbed *COOH, *CO, and *H were obtained by  where E is the DFT-derived total energy of a system. Zero point energies (ZPE), enthalpic temperature correction  and entropy correction (TS) were calculated on the basis of frequency analysis on the Cu(111) surface at room temperature 298.15 K (Table S3†). During this process, frequencies were calculated by treating all 3N degrees of the adsorbates as vibrational in the harmonic oscillator approximation and assuming that any changes in the vibrations of the substrate surface were minimal. The adsorbate solvation effects were included approximately in the same manner as in previous studies: *COOH was stabilized by 0.25 eV and *CO was stabilized by 0.10 eV.15 Gas-phase free energies were obtained by standard methods as well (Table S4†). The standard state pressure of 101.325 Pa was used for the fugacity of gaseous species (CO2 and CO); fugacity values of 3534 Pa and 19 Pa were used for H2O and HCOOH, respectively.1,15 Gas phase energetics of species containing a CO backbone were compensated to match experimental values: 0.19 eV for CO2, −0.30 eV for CO, and 0.15 eV for HCOOH.2
