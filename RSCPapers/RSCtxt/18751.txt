    , Accepted 11th December 2018First published on 11th December 2018AbstractAn interdigitated gold (Au) nanofilm was introduced on graphene, supported by a p-type silicon (p-Si) substrate, as an optoelectronic photodetector based on an Au/graphene/p-Si heterojunction by a low-cost method. Tunable photocurrent (photoconductivity) response to laser power density was realized under the modulation of the Au nanofilm and the Si layer on the carrier transport through graphene. Photoelectric measurements demonstrated that the device generated positive photocurrent when illuminated at low laser power density and negative photocurrent when illuminated at high laser power density. Positive photocurrents of 9 μA and 5 μA were generated at 1.13 μW cm−2 (power ∼ 20 nW) and 0.32 μW cm−2 (power ∼ 40 nW) under irradiation of 532 nm and 1064 nm lasers, respectively; responsivities of up to 450 A W−1 and 125 A W−1, were achieved, respectively, owing to the increase in carrier density caused by photo-induced carrier injection. At high power density, the mobility of graphene declined due to the scattering effect between carriers and phonons (bolometric effect), which was further strengthened by the local high-temperature field caused by the Au nanofilm. The negative photocurrent of up to several milliamperes was clearly observed under irradiation of 532 nm and 1064 nm lasers. The photocurrent response versus power density behavior of the photodetector could be modulated by the source–drain bias and laser wavelength. The device had a rapid response rate of the order of several hundred microseconds and good stability. The photodetector realized high-speed conversion of light density to photocurrent with different signs, demonstrating good potential for future applications in optoelectronic devices.
1. Introduction
Graphene is a kind of two-dimensional material that is composed of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a honey-comb lattice.1 Graphene holds enormous potential for future electronics2–4 and optoelectronics5,6 because of its novel properties, including ultrahigh mobility (2 × 105 cm2 V−1 s−1) for both electrons and holes,7–10 large mechanical strength (342 N m−1 for Young's modulus),11,12 and high thermal conductivity (5000 W m−1 K−1).13 Moreover, graphene can absorb photons at least from the visible to infrared range despite being only a single-layer thick.14 Plasmons would also be excited in graphene and focus on the long-wavelength band when irradiated by light.15 Recently, considerable efforts have been made to apply graphene in optoelectronic devices such as solar cells, touch panels, photodetectors, ultra-fast lasers, polarizers and optical modulators.16–24 The combination of its wideband absorption,14 short carrier life,25 ultrahigh thermal conductivity13 and ultrahigh mobility6–10 makes graphene an ideal material for optoelectronic devices. Additionally, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth of large-area graphene26–28 offers a low-cost and efficient way to fabricate graphene-based devices while maintaining good properties of graphene. Recently, the growth of charge-neutral graphene on the metal has also been achieved.29,30 However, the low photoresponsivity and very low external quantum efficiency (0.1–0.2%)16,31 originating from the intrinsically poor light absorption of graphene (∼2.3% for single-layer graphene)14 limit the performance of graphene-based optoelectronic devices. So far, many approaches have been tested to obtain graphene-based optoelectronic devices with excellent performance, such as building asymmetric electrodes31 and integrating graphene with metallic plasmons25 or quantum dots32 to enhance light absorption. Some researchers harnessed attributes of graphene into existing silicon-based platforms to obtain high-performance photodetectors based on graphene–silicon junctions, which provided ultrahigh and broadband photocurrent response.33–35 Graphene-based optoelectronic devices generally display an increase or decrease in current (photocurrent polarity) when illuminated by light and the photocurrent amplitude is modulated by light power. The polarity of the observed photocurrent depends on dominant mechanisms operating in different devices, including the photovoltaic effect, photo-thermoelectric effect and bolometric effect.36–42 The modulation of photocurrent polarity has also been achieved by tuning the gate voltage to control the competition among the photovoltaic effect, photo-thermoelectric effect and bolometric effect. It is necessary to explore the modulation of photocurrent sign and amplitude of photocurrents by simple and efficient methods, such as light power and source–drain bias. On the one hand, it is helpful to further investigate the carrier transportation in graphene and provide new insight into controllable modulation on the electronic properties of graphene; on the other hand, it would offer more thoughts and further expand the application of graphene in materials, chemical and physical sciences, especially in detectors, safety precautions, information storage/reading and future optoelectronic devices.
The thermal diffusivities of Au thin films become smaller than those of the bulk materials as the thickness of the metallic thin films decreases. When the thickness of the Au film is about 30 nm, the thermal diffusivity is only 10% of the bulk,43 which is about one order of magnitude smaller than that of p-Si. Therefore, a high-temperature field would form around the Au nanofilm to influence carrier transportation under laser irradiation. The mobility of graphene can be influenced by temperature. Therefore, the combination of Au nanofilm and graphene would be a way to achieve the regulation of photocurrent sign.
Here we used a low-cost method to introduce an Au nanofilm onto graphene and fabricated an Au/graphene/p-Si optoelectronic photodetector. When illuminated by a laser, the hole density in graphene had a large increase due to photo-induced carrier injection under the influence of a built-in electric field between graphene and the p-Si substrate. Ultrahigh and fast response was ensured by fast and efficient separation of holes from electrons and prolonged lifetime of holes. However, the laser not only induced more charge carriers but also generated more phonons. The scattering effect between phonons and charge carriers (bolometric effect) could lead to the decrease of mobility. The high-temperature field around the Au nanofilm further strengthened the scattering effect. Thus, as the power density was increased, the reduced charge mobility played a more important role in the generation of photocurrent than did the carrier density increase and ultimately dominated the photoresponse. Negative photocurrent was clearly observed at high power density with 532 nm and 1064 nm lasers. We developed a theoretical model to explain the mechanism by which the photocurrent sign was modulated and used this model to fit the experimental data. The model was further verified by experimental measurement results under vacuum conditions and micro-region photoelectric scanning results under ambient conditions. We accomplished a high-speed conversion of power density to photocurrent with different signs, suggesting that an optoelectronic photodetector based on an Au/graphene/p-Si heterojunction has good potential for further applications.
2. Experimental
2.1 Device fabrication
We transferred single-layer graphene onto a silicon wafer according to the method reported by Li and co-workers.44 The silicon substrate had a p-doping level of about 1016 cm−3 and an area of 1 cm × 1 cm and a thickness of 670 μm. Single-layer graphene was grown by the CVD method. Interdigitated gold nanofilms with a thickness of about 30 nm were deposited as the source and drain electrodes on the graphene layer by vacuum thermal evaporation under a vacuum of about 3 × 10−3 Pa. The interdigitated electrodes had eight fingers with a width of 100 μm and 100 μm spacing between fingers.
2.2 Structural characterization and testing of photoelectric properties
Raman spectrum analysis was carried out with a LabRAM HR evolution Raman system under 532 nm laser illumination. Graphene and Au nanofilm morphology were characterized by SEM (S-5500, Hitachi). A spectrophotometer (LAMBDA950, PerkinElmer) was used to measure light absorption of the device. Current–voltage (I–V) curves and photoelectric responses were measured using a source-meter (Keithley 2400) under 532 nm and 1064 nm lasers with circular spot diameters of 1.5 mm and 4 mm, respectively. The high-speed responses of the device were measured using a chopper and a precision source/measurement unit (Agilent B2911A). A photocurrent map was scanned on a multifunctional and high resolution near-field optoelectronic and spectroscopic imaging microscope (Alpha 300RAS, WITec).
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a depicts a schematic of the device. Fig. 1b shows a Raman spectrum of the graphene sample used in the device. The G peak at 1583 cm−1 and the 2D peak at 2686 cm−1 are obvious, with full width at half maximum values of 22 cm−1 and 38 cm−1, respectively. The intensity of the sharp 2D peak is roughly twice that of the G peak, which is a hallmark of monolayer graphene.27,45,46 These spectral characteristics indicate that single-layer graphene was well transferred onto the p-Si substrate. Fig. 1c presents a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the Au nanofilm, which reveals that it is composed of densely packed nanoparticles. The absorption spectrum of the device (Fig. 1d) features two strong broad absorption peaks at about 450 nm and 1020 nm, which we attribute to the absorption of Au plasmons and p-Si.

The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the Au/graphene/p-Si device were measured (Fig. 2). The device demonstrated nearly linear I–V behavior, indicating that a nearly ohmic contact was formed between the graphene layer and Au metal electrodes. The graphene was p-type doped, as proved by the source–drain current as a function of gate bias, measured on transferred graphene on a p-Si substrate with a 300 nm SiO2 layer (Fig. S1b, ESI†). The p-type doping resulted from trapped H2O and/or O2 molecules,47 and/or neighboring Au metal.48 The slope of the I–V curve in Fig. 2 changed slightly at 0.7 V because of the influence of the p-Si substrate, corresponding to the I–V behavior of Au/p-Si. The current of the p-Si substrate increased with voltage until reaching saturation at about 0.7 V, as shown in Fig. S2c (ESI†).

The photoelectric responses of the Au/graphene/p-Si device under 1064 nm laser irradiation at low and high power density are shown in Fig. 3. When the device was irradiated at low power density, positive photocurrent was generated (Fig. 3a). Photocurrent is defined as the difference between the currents with and without laser irradiation. The photocurrent increased rapidly and saturated in a short time under irradiation. The photocurrent decreased to the initial level when the laser was shut off. When the power density was less than 1 mW cm−2, the photocurrent increased with power density, indicating that higher power can excite more carriers and induce higher photoconductivity. The conductivity of the p-Si substrate also increased when illuminated by a laser (Fig. S2d, ESI†), but its photocurrent was obviously smaller than that of the Au/graphene/p-Si device. The generated high photocurrent resulted from photo-induced carrier injection from the p-Si substrate into graphene. Fig. 3b shows that the photocurrent of the device had a nonlinear dependence on the source–drain bias, and higher photocurrent can be obtained by adding a larger bias. This nonlinearity originated from the energy dependent charge transfer between graphene and the p-Si substrate, which will be discussed in more detail later.

Fig. 3c and d show the optoelectronic performance of the Au/graphene/p-Si device at high power density. Under 1064 nm laser irradiation at a power density of 32 mW cm−2 (power ∼ 4 mW), negative photocurrent was clearly observed. When the laser was on, there was a rapid decrease in current until it reached a stable value. When the laser was switched off, the device current restored rapidly. The absolute value of negative photocurrent increased with laser power, up to 2.8 mA at 240 mW cm−2 (power ∼ 30 mW). In the Au/graphene/p-Si device, homogeneous graphene doping, ohmic contacts with the Au electrode and symmetric structure ensured no formation of the in-plane p–n junction other than the vertical graphene/p-Si heterojunction. Furthermore, the laser spot size (∼4 mm) was much larger than the width of adjacent interdigitated electrodes. Therefore, the thermoelectric effect resulting from the temperature gradient and photovoltaic effect resulting from the photo-induced electric field within the laser area made only a small contribution to the generation of negative photocurrent. Although the applied source–drain bias rendered uniform doping asymmetry for efficient doping along the graphene channel, this effect was prominent at low doping,40 which would not have obvious influence on the transferred high-doping graphene in the Au/graphene/p-Si device (Fig. S1b, ESI†). The decrease of current was attributed to scattering between carriers and phonons due to the bolometric effect, as reported in previous studies of the bolometric effect in the presence of a visible light field40 or terahertz field.41,42 At power densities of 32, 80, 160 and 240 mW cm−2, and power values of 4, 10, 20 and 30 mW, the increments of resistance were 0.49, 1.89, 2.92 and 3.62 Ω, respectively. Resistance sensitivity (i.e., the ratio of resistance increments to power increments) changed from 660 Ω W−1 to 252 Ω W−1 as power increased from 4 mW to 30 mW. The resistance sensitivity was larger than the reported values in the presence of a terahertz field,41 which originated from the designed Au/graphene/p-Si structure. The dependence of negative photocurrent on source–drain bias is displayed in Fig. 3d. The absolute value of negative photocurrent increased with voltage until reaching a maximum and then gradually decreased. The maximum photocurrent and corresponding required bias became larger with increasing power density.
The photoelectric responses of the device under 532 nm laser irradiation (Fig. S3, ESI†) were similar to those under 1064 nm irradiation. The dependences of the device photocurrent on power density under 532 nm and 1064 nm laser irradiation are presented in Fig. 4a. The two curves demonstrated that the device photocurrent increased with laser power and reached a positive maximum value at critical power density, which was defined as the power density at which device photocurrent started to decrease. Above the critical power density, the increase of power density resulted in a gradual decrease of photocurrent until it became negative. The critical power density depended on laser wavelength and was higher under 532 nm laser irradiation than that under 1064 nm laser irradiation.
 Fig. 4  (a) Device photocurrent and (b) responsivity versus power density under 532 nm and 1064 nm laser irradiation at a source–drain bias of 2 V. 
From the obtained photocurrent data, we calculated the device responsivity R: (1)where Iph and P represent photocurrent and laser power, respectively. The dependence of R on laser power is shown in Fig. 4b. The value of R decreased as the power increased; thus, the highest R can be obtained at the lowest detectable illumination power. At a bias of 2 V, the device displayed photocurrent responses of 9 μA at 1.13 μW cm−2 (the power ∼ 20 nW) under 532 nm laser irradiation and 5 μA at 0.32 μW cm−2 (the power ∼ 40 nW) under 1064 nm laser irradiation. Thus, R reached 450 A W−1 and 125 A W−1 under 532 nm and 1064 nm laser irradiation, respectively. The photon energy and surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) excited on the Au film caused the difference in responsivities under irradiation of a 532 nm laser and 1064 nm laser. At low power density, the measured noise equivalent power (NEP) was about 10−9 W. Under 1064 nm laser illumination at high power density, an increase in R occurred after the conversion of photocurrent sign at 12 mW cm−2.
We then explored the ability of the source–drain bias to modulate the change of photocurrent sign. We used the maximum positive photocurrents to normalize the photocurrent at each bias under 1064 nm laser illumination. As shown in Fig. 5a, the power density-dependent photocurrent curves were similar at 2, 3, 4, and 5 V, but the critical power density was regulated by the bias. The critical power density increased with source–drain bias, as shown in Fig. 5b. The source–drain bias was an efficient way to adjust carrier injection from p-Si to graphene and carrier movement in graphene. At a high source–drain bias, factors such as carrier density and drift velocity which were helpful for positive photocurrent, were enhanced to compete with the scattering effect that was helpful for the generation of negative photocurrent.
 Fig. 5  (a) Normalized photocurrent versus power density at the source–drain biases of 2, 3, 4 and 5 V. The observed maximum positive photocurrents were used to normalize photocurrent at each bias. The maximum positive photocurrents at biases of 2, 3, 4, and 5 V were 335, 735, 900, and 1440 μA, respectively. (b) Critical power density versus source–drain bias. The laser wavelength was 1064 nm. 

Fig. 6 displays the transient responses and high-frequency performance of the device under 532 nm laser irradiation. The rise and fall times were determined from the transient responses based on the times at which the 90% increase and decrease of the original photocurrent were observed, respectively. Fig. 6a revealed that the photocurrent increased from the dark current to the saturated valued in 200 μs at a low power density of 57 mW cm−2. The photocurrent then decreased because of the diffusion of opposite carriers resulting from the decreased built-in field and thermal effects. The time response of the photocurrent decay was dominated by two stages, one with a faster lifetime of 300 μs and a slow component that was associated with the thermal effects of p-Si and Au nanofilm. At a high power density of 1500 mW cm−2 (Fig. 6b), when the laser was switched on, the current decreased rapidly to a stable value in about 400 μs. When the laser was shut off, the photocurrent started to increase for 500 μs and then decreased because of the majority carrier trapping effect at high laser power.49 The fast recovery of current originated from high thermal conductivity of graphene. The longer times of the rise and fall processes at high power density compared with those at low power density originated from the negative influence of phonon scattering. Fig. 6c and d show the photoelectric response of the device under 532 nm illumination at 57 mW cm−2 and 1500 mW cm−2, respectively, with a 1500 Hz optical chopper. The periodic photo-response displayed the same frequency as the chopper, suggesting that the generation of photocurrent was in response to laser illumination. The photocurrent exhibited good stability during the high-frequency cycling. When the laser irradiated the device, carriers were excited in p-Si. Holes were pulled into graphene by the built-in electric field, leading to a rapid increase of the hole density in graphene and electrons were pulled into p-Si, as shown in Fig. 6e. A high-temperature field was formed around the Au nanofilm and graphene. The scattering between carriers and phonons resulted in the decrease of current at high power density.

All the measurements were obtained at a bias of 2 V using the 532 nm laser. (e) Cross-sectional schematic diagram (left) and band diagram (right) of the graphene/p-Si heterojunction. 
Then we developed a model to explain the above phenomenon. The p-Si substrate only exhibits a small photocurrent change compared with that of graphene, so it is ignored here. The Au nanofilm is in series with graphene and the photocurrent could be described by the following expressions: (2) (3)
Based on perturbation theory, we obtain: (4)where Rtot_D and Rtot_ph are total resistance of the circuit without and with laser irradiation, respectively; RAu, RC and Rg are resistance of the Au nanofilm, contact interface and graphene without laser irradiation, respectively; L and W are graphene length and width between the two Au electrodes, respectively; n is the carrier density; and μ is mobility. The symbols with the subscripts 1 and 2 represent parameters in the absence and in the presence of light, respectively. ΔRAu and ΔRC are small increments of RAu and RC under laser irradiation, respectively. Although ΔRAu is helpful for the negative photocurrent, it is not a major contribution. The expression of photocurrent can be simplified as: Iph ∝ [n2μ2(T) − n1μ1](5)
Therefore, the photocurrent was determined by the combined effects of n and μ. The mobility of graphene decreases gradually with the increase of temperature according to theoretical analysis.50,51 Under the illumination of light, on the one hand, light induces more charge carriers. On the other hand, the light induces heat and generates more phonons. The heat is further enhanced due to the existence of Au nanofilm. A local high-temperature field forms within the laser spot area. The scattering between phonons and charge carriers leads to the decrease of μ2(T). The temperature T has a relationship with laser power, laser wavelength and vacuum conditions.
When a beam of laser with power P is applied to the device and photon energy hν is larger than the band gap of p-Si, change of carrier density in graphene induced by the laser can be expressed as follows: (6)where η0 is the light absorption efficiency and η1 is the transfer (from Si to graphene) efficiency. Here, η1 has a relationship with the electric field (source–drain bias U) and barrier height between graphene and the p-Si substrate, η1 = η1(E,Φbi).
At low power density, the increase of carrier density n dominates and the photocurrent is positive. With the increase of source–drain bias, carriers have higher kinetic energy and larger probability η1 to transfer from p-Si to graphene, resulting in a larger slope in the I–V curve. While at the high laser power density, the decrease of mobility dominates because of enhanced phonon scattering for higher local temperature.50 Therefore, negative photocurrent appears. For a laser with shorter wavelength such as the 532 nm laser, on the one hand, the larger photon energy induced high-energy charge carriers and largerη1; on the other hand, more SPPs excited on the Au nanofilm lead to enhancement of light absorption. The two factors lead to larger critical power density compared with the 1064 nm laser. The increase of critical power density with the source–drain bias U results from larger η1 and high-energy carriers due to higher electric field.
Further, we performed a semi-quantitative analysis. The resistivity has a linear dependence on temperature above 50 K,50,51 which is applicable for temperature change in our gold/graphene/p-Si device due to the bolometric effect. Assuming T ∝ P, we obtain  (α is a parameter). As for change of carrier density Δn under irradiation of a laser, the light absorption efficiency and transfer efficiency were influenced by power due to saturated absorption and a decreased built-in electric field, respectively. Thus, the carrier density increase Δn can be considered as a power relationship with laser power Δn = C × pδ (C and δ are parameters, δ < 1). After some algebra, the photocurrent was calculated as: (7)where β = μ1 × C and γ = n1μ1 × α are independent parameters associated with the incident photon energy and source–drain bias. The transition point power P0 (at which the photo current changes sign, i.e., I = 0) is (β/γ)1/(1−δ). For incident field with higher photon energy or higher source–drain bias, β increases, leading to larger P0 as observed in experiments (Fig. 4a and 5a). Our model matched well with the experimental data, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†).
If the device was operated under vacuum conditions, the heat induced by light could not be dissipated through air conduction. The phonon–carrier scattering effect caused by local heat should be more obvious and negative photocurrent would be generated more easily according to the above analysis. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the photoelectronic response of the device was negative rather than positive even at low power density, which was consistent with the above predictions. The Au interdigitated electrodes that enhance the thermal effect are important for the realization of conversion of positive and negative photocurrent.
To provide further evidence to support the above analysis, the photoelectric performance of the device was measured using a near-field photoelectric scanning platform. The light source used was a 532 nm laser with the beam diameter of 1 μm. The scanning area was 30 μm × 30 μm, as shown in Fig. 7a. Because of the small beam diameter, the power density (∼1.27 × 108 mW cm−2) of the laser beam was high enough for graphene to generate a negative photocurrent at 1 mW, as shown in Fig. 7b. The absolute value of the negative photocurrent for graphene covered by the Au nanofilm was larger than that of uncovered graphene, which indicated that the Au nanofilm enhanced phonon–carrier scattering because of the strengthened thermal effect. The photocurrent map was consistent with the corresponding optical microscopy image. In addition to phonon–carrier scattering, SPP–electron interactions likely also lead to scattering channels and contributed to the decrease in current.52

To verify cyclic generation of positive and negative photocurrent and investigate the potential application of the Au/graphene/p-Si photodetector, a measurement configuration was constructed, as illustrated in Fig. 8a. As the blue curve shows in Fig. 8b, the transmissivities of 64 sector areas in a disk were separately adjusted by evaporating the Au films with different thicknesses. By adjusting the power density illuminating the Au/graphene/p-Si photodetector with the uniform rotating disk, the different laser power densities were rapidly and synchronously converted into the positive and negative photocurrent of the photoconductive photodetector, as shown in Fig. 8b. The transmissivity of 0%, 10% and 100% corresponded to a photocurrent of 0, +0.4 mA and −0.4 mA, respectively. The photocurrent response was consistent with the transmissivities on the disk. The photocurrent measured in Fig. 8b was large with a rapid response and the device exhibited good stability.

A disk was equally divided into 64 sector areas. The Au films with different thicknesses were evaporated on different sector areas to realize different transmissivities (0%, 10%, 100%) for a 532 nm laser. The beam of the 532 nm laser passed through the uniform rotating disk and then acted on the photoconductive Au/graphene/p-Si device. The angular velocity of the rotating disk was 30.5 rad s−1.

4. Conclusions
We fabricated an Au/graphene/p-Si photodetector by a simple, low-cost method. Graphene was transferred onto the surface of a p-Si substrate as a conductive channel and then an Au nanofilm was included to regulate the photocurrent response of the photodetector. The photodetector achieved positive R values of up to 450 A W−1 and 125 A W−1 under 532 nm and 1064 nm laser irradiation at low power density, respectively. At high power density, the photodetector displayed a negative photocurrent response of up to several milliamperes under both 532 nm and 1064 nm laser irradiation because of the enhanced carrier–phonon scattering effect. The conversion of photocurrent sign relying on laser power density could be further modulated by the laser wavelength and source–drain bias. The photodetector had a response time of about hundreds of microseconds and good stability under ambient conditions. This photodetector provides an effective way to realize the regulation of photocurrent sign and exhibits great potential for future optoelectronics.
