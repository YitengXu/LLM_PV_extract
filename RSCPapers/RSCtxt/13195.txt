Soc., Faraday Trans. 1, 1989, 85, 1685-1696Analytical characterization of electrode surface by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. β-PbO2-based cathode in voltage-compatible lithium cells(Note: The full text of this document is currently only available in the PDF Version )Cosimino Malitesta, Luigia Sabbatini, Pier G. Zambonin, Luisa Peraldo Bicelli and Silvia MaffiAbstractLead dioxide cathodes, discharged in a lithium cell at significant points of the discharge curve, have been analysed by XPS and information obtained on the surface chemical composition has been used to elucidate the cell discharge mechanism.General and particular problems and complications arising in XPS investigations when ‘real’ samples are involved are critically outlined with obvious reference to the intrinsic difficulty in the surface analytical characterization of a mixture of lead compounds. An approach is suggested which stresses how even semiquantitative determinations could play a key role in the speciation analysis.
