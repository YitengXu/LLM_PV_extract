    , Accepted 29th September 2016First published on 29th September 2016AbstractDeveloping inexpensive and non-toxic electrocatalysts that can reduce CO2 to formate with high selectivity and stability as well as high current densities is an important step for a sustainable carbon cycle. Electrocatalysts that show the highest faradaic efficiency for formate, such as Pb and Hg, are toxic or expensive and have low current densities. Bulk Zn is a cheap metal that has historically been identified to be a CO2 to CO conversion catalyst. In this work, we introduce a novel Zn electrode with a layer of nanoparticles that exhibit high performance toward CO2 electrochemical reduction to produce formate in aqueous solution. The maximum faradaic efficiency for formate production of over 87% is achieved with a formate partial current density of 12.8 mA cm−2, which are almost 8 times higher than that of bulk Zn foil and 17 times higher than that of bulk Zn foil, respectively. The improvement in catalytic performance is attributed to the catalytically active facets and special surface structure of polycrystalline Zn formed during reduction of polycrystalline ZnO. The catalyst shows no obvious performance deterioration during the 14 h continuous CO2 reduction.
Introduction
In the last century, the earth has experienced an unprecedented growth in energy consumption due to the development of the economy. As the main source of industrial energy, fossil fuels play a key role in the development of the society.1 Unfortunately, an increase in the emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere caused by combustion of fossil fuels has broken the natural balance of the CO2 level in the atmosphere, which leads to the greenhouse effect, arguably contributing to acceleration of the trend of global warming and climate changes.2 Hence, in order to maintain environmental stability, reducing the atmospheric CO2 concentration has been one of the burning issues of environmental protection.3,4
Thus, great efforts from all over the world have been made to limit the emission of CO2, capture or store CO2 and convert CO2 into useful chemicals.5 Different strategies for CO2 conversion and utilization have been reported in the literature, such as chemical,6 electrochemical,7–9 photochemical10,11 or biological12,13 reduction of CO2. Among these methods, electrochemical reduction of CO2 using renewable energy (solar, wind, geothermal, etc.) or nuclear energy as the power source is considered clean and sustainable, allowing storage of the excess electricity and the intermittent renewable energy in the form of liquid fuels or chemical products.14,15
During the past few decades, researchers have focused their research on developing different catalysts for electrochemical reduction of CO2 to obtain different products. Formate is regarded as a suitable candidate for fuel cells and a viable hydrogen storage material.16 Metal catalysts, such as Pb, Hg, In, Sn, Cd, Tl, etc., are identified to be the most promising choices for efficient reduction of CO2 to formate.17 However, most of them are highly toxic, or expensive, or both. Moreover, it is hard for these catalysts to simultaneously exhibit high faradaic efficiency and high current densities. Developing low-cost and non-toxic electrocatalysts that can convert CO2 to formate with high selectivity and stability and high current densities is an attractive topic in current research studies.18
Zn is an abundant and cheap element and can meet the demand for commercial applications on a large scale. Among all the metallic catalysts, Zn catalysts have been reported to electrochemically convert CO2 into CO in a selective and efficient way.19,20 Combinations of Zn and other metals may show different electrochemical properties for CO2 reduction. Cu2O/ZnO-based electrodes have been reported for electrochemical CO2 reduction to methanol.21,22 In the early work of Hori,23 Zn has shown poor reproducibility for formate and CO selectivity. Their faradaic efficiencies were not stable, which varied over a wide range, from 3.3 to 63.3% for the CO product, whereas from 17.6 to 85.0% for formate at the same potential. Recently, Rosen et al.19 reported a nanostructured Zn dendrite electrocatalyst and the main product for this catalyst was CO with a faradaic efficiency of about 80%. This work has aroused the interest in developing different Zn catalysts.20 However, no work has been reported for the selective reduction of CO2 to formate products with a high faradaic efficiency and stability. Purkait et al.24 reported an electrocatalyst composed of Zn powders for reduction of CO2 to formate, and its maximum faradaic efficiency of 78.46% was obtained only in the first 10 min of the reaction. It decreased sharply to 29.3% in 15 min.
Zn electrodes are easy to be oxidized when exposed to air or immersed in aqueous electrolytes for a long time, which has a great influence on the catalytic activity, selectivity and stability of Zn electrodes. This hampers the final application of this class of catalysts. The catalytic activity and product selectivity of bulk catalysts can be increased by changing their morphology to nanostructures. For example, Zn catalysts with a surface of nanoplates or dendrites have been reported to selectively convert CO2 into CO;19,20 these two kinds of surface structures have more edge sites, which have been confirmed to be much more selective for CO2 reduction to CO by a density functional theory (DFT) study.25 However, a minimal change in the surface orientation or morphology of a metal catalyst can strongly affect its catalytic activity and product selectivity for electrochemical CO2 reduction.26 In this study, we report a three-step approach to modify the surface structure of Zn foil for synthesizing polycrystalline Zn electrode with a layer of nanoparticles, which has more low-coordinated active sites and can selectively reduce CO2 to formate in aqueous solution. An electrodeposition method and annealing treatment followed by a reduction process were used to significantly improve the performance of Zn catalysts. The as-prepared catalyst achieves a faradaic efficiency of 87.1% at −1.93 V vs. RHE, which is almost 8 times higher compared to that of bulk Zn foil. The formate partial current density of the as-prepared Zn electrode (12.8 mA cm−2) is almost 17 times higher than that of bulk Zn foil. It also shows negligible deterioration during 14 h continuous electrolysis. A prolonged stability makes it a promising catalyst for electrochemical CO2 conversion with superior formate selectivity in long term operations.
Experimental section
Materials
H3PO4 (85 wt% in water) was purchased from Heng Xing Reagent, China; NaHCO3 (99.95%) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich; zinc foil (thickness 0.1 mm, 99.99%) was purchased from Beijing HZTR Science & Technology Developing Center, China; ZnO (99.99%) was purchased from Chemical Reagent, China. All the materials were used without further purification. Electrolyte solutions were prepared using 18.2 MΩ H2O (ELGA LabWater, UK).
Preparation of electrodes

Zn-foil. 
The purchased Zn foil was first sonicated in water and then in ethanol to clean the surface. After drying under Ar, the Zn foil was anodized at constant current density (10 mA cm−2) for 5 min in 85% H3PO4 solution. Then, it was sonicated in DIW and dried under Ar.


D-Zn. 
The electrodeposition electrolyte containing 6 M KOH and 0.4 M ZnO for Zn deposition was obtained by dissolving KOH pellets and ZnO powder in deionized water. The electrodeposition was carried out with a three-electrode system. The above-treated Zn-foil was applied as the working electrode. The Hg2Cl2/Hg/saturated KCl electrode (0.242 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)) worked as a reference and a Pt sheet worked as a counter electrode. A thin Zn layer was deposited on the treated Zn foil at a constant current density of 10 mA cm−2 for 5 min by using a Solartron 1287 electrochemical workstation. After washing with deionized water and drying under Ar, the deposited Zn (D-Zn) electrode was obtained.


AD-Zn. 
The prepared D-Zn was then immediately placed in an oven preset to 300 °C and annealed in air for 8 hours to obtain the annealed Zn, which is denoted as AD-Zn.


RAD-Zn. 
The fabricated AD-Zn was subsequently reduced during the process of electrochemical CO2 reduction at −1.5 V (vs. SCE) within 15 min in CO2-bubbled 0.5 M NaHCO3 solution to obtain RAD-Zn. In all electrochemical processes, the stirring speed of the solution is 500 rpm.

Electrode characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-7800F) was used to observe the morphology of the samples. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction images were obtained on a JEOL JEM-2000EX (120 kV). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns collected on a DX-2700 from Dandong Haoyuan Instrument operating at 40 kV and 30 mA with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) were used for crystal structure analysis. The XRD data were collected from 30° to 80° in 2θ at a scanning rate of 1° per min. An ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) system equipped with a nonmonochromatized Al Kα X-ray source was used to analyze the surface properties. The Zn/O atomic ratio was calculated using the XPS peak area and atomic relative sensitivity factor (Zn: 28.72; O: 2.93).
Electrochemical measurement details
Electrochemical CO2 reduction experiments were carried out with a PARSTAT 2273 potentiostat (EG&G Instrument) with a Hg2Cl2/Hg/saturated KCl electrode (0.242 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)) as a reference and a Pt sheet as a counter electrode. The working electrodes (WEs) were the as-prepared Zn electrodes. It should be noted that the reference electrode potential of the SCE can be converted to that of the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the formula E(RHE) = E(SCE) + 0.242 V + 0.0591 V × pH. Thus, the potential using the SCE is 0.67 V more negative than that of the RHE. The active geometric surface area of the WE was 3 cm2. The electrochemical measurements were conducted in a gas-tight electrochemical cell separated into two compartments by a piece of proton exchange membrane Nafion 115 (Dupont, USA). The cathode electrolyte was 180 ml of 0.5 M NaHCO3 saturated with CO2. The anode electrolyte was 100 ml of 0.1 M H2SO4 aqueous solution. During the CO2 reduction experiments, the electrolyte in the cathodic compartment was stirred at 500 rpm and CO2 gas was purged into the cathodic compartment at a flow rate of 60 ml min−1. The output gas was vented directly into the gas-sampling loop of a gas chromatograph (GC, Shimadzu GC-2014). Argon (99.999%) and nitrogen (99.999%) were used as the carrier gases. The column effluent (separated gas mixtures) was first passed through a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) where hydrogen was quantified; it was then passed through a methanizer where CO was converted to methane and subsequently quantified by using a flame ionization detector (FID). The liquid product was quantified by ion chromatography (ICS-1100, Dionex Corporation).
A linear voltammetric sweep was performed with a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 between E = −0.53 V vs. RHE and E = −2.33 vs. RHE with a VersaSTAT 3 potentiostat (EG&G Instrument).
Results and discussion
A piece of Zn foil was initially electrochemically treated to get a fresh and relatively smooth surface (Zn-foil, Fig. S1a and b†), and then an electrodeposition method was used to produce rock-like Zn layers (D-Zn, Fig. S1c and d†) on it. Fig. 1a shows the SEM images of AD-Zn. It can be observed that the textural structure of AD-Zn is significantly different from that of D-Zn. A dense layer composed of nanoparticles is formed on the surface of the rock-like layers of D-Zn. Fig. 1b gives the SEM images of the RAD-Zn, obtained by electrochemically reducing the AD-Zn at −0.83 V vs. RHE in CO2 saturated 0.5 M NaHCO3 solution. After electrochemical reduction, the surface nanostructure and morphology of AD-Zn are well maintained and uniformly distributed nanoparticles can be observed on the surface of RAD-Zn. The range of the typical diameters of the obtained nanoparticles is from 20 to 60 nm. This unique nanostructure composed of nanoparticles results in a comparatively larger specific surface area, according to the results of the study of the double layer capacitances and the roughness factor of the prepared Zn electrodes (Fig. S2†).

The structures of the as-prepared Zn-foil, D-Zn, AD-Zn and RAD-Zn were determined using X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Fig. 2a). The XRD spectra demonstrate the highly crystalline nature of the as-prepared Zn catalysts. All the diffraction peaks of the Zn-foil are precisely aligned with the pattern of pure metallic Zn (JCPDS file#: #04-0831) and well defined. The XRD pattern of D-Zn is similar to that of Zn-foil. The diffraction peak for the (101) face is dominant for Zn-foil and D-Zn. From the XRD patterns of AD-Zn and RAD-Zn, it can be observed that the dominating compositions in these two samples are also the pure metallic Zn phase, but their internal crystal structures are changed. The (103) reflection becomes the dominant phase and the decreased intensity of main diffraction peaks demonstrates the refinement of the crystal size. Moreover, an increased intensity of the peak at 36° corresponding to both the Zn (002) face and ZnO (101) face can be observed for the AD-Zn. However, the intensity of this peak for RAD-Zn catalysts decreases after reduction at −0.83 V vs. RHE for 30 min, indicating that it mainly corresponds to the ZnO (101) face.

Fig. 2b shows the current density–time curves collected at −0.83 V of D-Zn and AD-Zn vs. RHE. During the initial CO2 electroreduction at −0.83 V vs. RHE, a cathodic peak can be observed during the first 100 s for the annealed-D-Zn, which is attributed to the reduction of ZnO to Zn metal (Fig. 2b red). Comparatively, no cathodic peak appears for D-Zn before annealing (Fig. 2b black). This demonstrates that a certain amount of ZnO is formed on the surface of Zn during the annealing process for the AD-Zn and it is mostly reduced after the reduction process, which is consistent with the XRD analysis.
In addition, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) characterization was applied to further prove the formation of ZnO layers on the AD-Zn (Fig. 3a). The HRTEM image of the AD-Zn shows a thin (2–6 nm) amorphous layer near the surface, which is followed by a polycrystalline structure with apparent d-spacings consistent with ZnO (Fig. 3a). However, the internal slice under the surface of AD-Zn shows a highly monocrystalline structure which can be observed in Fig. S3,† and the d-spacings for the Zn(002) facet are indicated as well. Polycrystalline diffraction patterns can be observed in Fig. 3b. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the surface layer of AD-Zn shows rings in a wide range of diameters, which can be assigned to the reflections of planes belonging to ZnO and metallic Zn. Combining with the XRD results presented above, this observation indicates the existence of ZnO in the AD-Zn. According to the XRD and current–time curves in Fig. 2, polycrystalline ZnO on the surface of AD-Zn should be reduced to polycrystalline Zn in the process of electrochemical CO2 reduction. Thus, catalytically active facets could be exposed on the surface of the RAD-Zn electrode under experimental conditions.

The surface chemical structures of the Zn electrocatalysts were further analyzed via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS Zn2p and O1s spectra of the as-prepared Zn-foil, D-Zn, AD-Zn and RAD-Zn catalysts are shown in Fig. 4. It can be observed that the as-prepared Zn foil and D-Zn have a similar binding energy value of 1022.0 ± 0.1 eV at the peak of Zn2p3/2 (Fig. 4a). However, the Zn2p3/2 binding energy shifts towards smaller energy (1021.6 ± 0.1 eV) for AD-Zn after treatment in air. This indicates that more Zn atoms are bound to oxygen atoms.27 Correspondingly, the Zn2p3/2 peak binding energy of RAD-Zn shifts to 1022.2 ± 0.1 eV, which is the result of the reduction of Zn in the oxidation state to metallic Zn.27
 Fig. 4  XPS Zn2p (a) and (b) O1s spectrum of the as-prepared Zn-foil, D-Zn, AD-Zn and RAD-Zn catalysts. 
The typical O1s peak for all the Zn electrocatalysts can be consistently fitted and convoluted to three peaks as shown in Fig. 4 b. The components of O1s are shown in Table S2.† The peak at the low binding energy, 530.3–530.6 eV, is attributed to oxygen from ZnO.28 Therefore, the intensity of this peak can be used to measure the amount of oxygen atoms in a fully oxidized stoichiometric surrounding. After annealing treatment, the ratio of this component significantly increases (Table S2†), which is attributed to the increased oxygen atoms existing as Zn–O bonds. Additionally, the ratio of this component decreases after reduction, proving the decrease of the ZnO species in the RAD-Zn. It should be mentioned that Zn can be easily oxidized in contact with air. Inevitably, a certain amount of ZnO could always be observed in the as-prepared samples.19 The medium binding energy component centered at 531.5–531.7 eV may be associated with oxygen deficiency on the surface. Therefore, changes in the intensity of this component may be partly attributed to the variations in the concentration of oxygen vacancies. The surface of Zn foil is dominated by the oxygen deficient state, which may be related to the treatment of anodic oxidation with H3PO4 solution. The higher binding energy component located at 532.2–532.4 eV is usually attributed to the presence of loosely bound oxygen on the surface of the electrode belonging to special species, such as –CO3 or adsorbed H2O.29 Although the samples were dried in an inert atmosphere after cleaning with pure water or annealed at a temperature as high as 300 °C for 8 h, some amount of chemisorbed oxygen (e.g. H2O) could still be detected on the surface of all electrodes, because it is difficult for the electrodes to avoid contact with air before XPS examination. XPS results for different samples are shown in Table S2.† The AD-Zn has the highest atomic ratio of Zn/O, which may be due to the decreased relative intensity of the high binding energy component of O1s, because the desorption of loosely bound oxygen (e.g. H2O) on the surface would happen during the annealing process.
To evaluate the reduction potential of the as-prepared electrodes for CO2 reduction, linear sweep voltammetry was first conducted in N2 or CO2 saturated 0.5 M NaHCO3 solution (Fig. 5). Higher current densities are achieved for all electrodes under a CO2 atmosphere than a N2 atmosphere, demonstrating that all the Zn electrodes are catalytically active towards CO2 reduction. The onset potential for CO2 reduction is −0.7 V (vs. RHE) for the RAD-Zn electrode, which is more positive than that of the Zn-foil electrode (−0.8 V vs. RHE). According to a previous report,30 introducing more active facets on the surface of the electrodes can facilitate the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2. Polycrystalline ZnO can introduce more active facets when reduced to polycrystalline Zn compared with single crystalline metallic Zn.

To further examine the electrochemical CO2 reduction performance of the as-prepared electrodes, an electrochemical experiment was conducted by applying constant potential electrolysis in 0.5 M NaHCO3 solution saturated with CO2. A range of potentials from −0.93 V to −2.13 V (vs. RHE) was chosen on the basis of CO2 reduction and hydrogen evolution onset potential of all electrodes (Fig. 6). The main products obtained during the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction process were calculated by gas chromatography and ion chromatography analyses. Under test conditions, formate is the primary product formed by the reduction of CO2 and H2 is a byproduct formed by the concurrent proton reduction reaction. In addition, a small amount of CO is also detected. Faradic efficiency is a measure of the selectivity of the process for a given product. Fig. 6a presents the faradaic efficiency of the formate product for electrochemical reduction of CO2 on Zn-foil, D-Zn and RAD-Zn under various potentials, which is calculated from the original electrochemical data and ion chromatography analyses. Among the three electrodes, RAD-Zn exhibits the most outstanding performance. The faradic efficiency toward formate of RAD-Zn is above 76% at moderate potentials, E = −0.93 V to −2.13 V (vs. RHE), reaching the maximum of 87.1% at −1.93 V, which is almost 8 times higher compared to that of Zn foil. Comparatively, the D-Zn exhibits higher selectivity for formate products than Zn-foil, reaching the highest faradic efficiency of 61.7% at the same potential. This demonstrates that the deposition of the Zn layer on Zn foil can improve the selectivity of the catalysts toward the formate product and the formation of the composited ZnO and Zn layer for the RAD-Zn can further improve the selectivity. As shown in Fig. 6b, Zn foil has the lowest formate partial current density. The dominant reaction on Zn-foil is the hydrogen evolution reaction, which contributes to its high hydrogen faradic efficiency (Fig. S4a†). Comparatively, the D-Zn displays much lower hydrogen partial current density than Zn-foil (Fig. S4b†), demonstrating that the D-Zn catalyst can suppress hydrogen evolution. This should be attributed to the formation of the newly created active sites through the electrodeposition of Zn ions. As shown in Fig. 6b, the formate partial current density of RAD-Zn is 12.8 mA cm−2, which is almost 17 times higher than that of Zn-foil and 4 times higher than that of D-Zn, demonstrating that the catalytic performance of electrochemical reduction of CO2 to formate is improved for RAD-Zn. Due to the annealing and electrochemical reduction processes, a dense layer composed of nanoparticles with a large specific surface area is formed on the electrode. According to previous reports,31–33 simply increasing the surface area of an electrode or forming nanoscale structural features is not sufficient to substantially improve CO2 reduction properties. It has been proved that more isolated nanoparticles expose catalytic sites that are more effective for CO2 reduction.34 Kanan also proved that structural differences contributed to the enhanced selectivity for CO observed on copper foil catalysts which are oxidized and then reduced.30 Hori et al.35,36 observed that the stepped copper surfaces exhibit different selectivities and that the reactions occur at lower potentials for a specific current density compared to the terrace facets. Chorkendorff et al.37 also suggested that the rougher surface contains significantly more low-coordination sites, such as steps, edges and defects, which seem to be more active towards CO2 reduction.

In our work, the Zn electrode obtained from the ZnO oxidation and electrochemical reductions presents a higher surface area and rough surface, which may contain more low-coordinated active sites. All these can facilitate the CO2 electrochemical reduction and contribute to the high selectivity for formate. These low-coordinated sites allow for stronger binding of reactants or intermediate species, which can lead to increased activity and changes in product selectivity. Based on this point, CO2 reduction activity to formate of the RAD-Zn electrode is initially enhanced, which might be relative to polycrystalline Zn with catalytically active facets formed by the reduction of polycrystalline ZnO. One point to be emphasized is that Zn has a relatively higher overpotential than other metal catalysts owing to its nature.19
To obtain kinetic insights into the mechanism of electrochemical reduction of CO2 to formate on the Zn electrode, formate partial current density was measured at potentials from −0.83 V to −0.93 V (vs. RHE) and Tafel plots of the RAD-Zn electrode were constructed (Fig. 7a). The Tafel plots present a slope of 153 mV dec−1 for the RAD-Zn electrode. On the basis of the results of the mechanism of CO2 reduction to formate reported,38 the possible pathway for electrochemical reduction of CO2 on the RAD-Zn electrode is illustrated in Fig. 7b. First, CO2 is dissolved into the electrolyte and adsorbed on the surface of the electrode. Then the adsorbed CO2 obtains an electron and is reduced to CO2˙−. After that, the CO2˙− radical is protonated by the proton transferred from HCO3− and obtains the second electron from the electrode to form adsorbed formate. Finally, the adsorbed formate is desorbed from the surface to produce the formate. There are two possible rate-determining steps of CO2 reduction to formate supported by previous reports,30,31,39 one is the single-electron transfer to CO2, the Tafel slope of which is about 118 mV dec−1, and the other is the proton transfer from HCO3− to CO2˙−, the Tafel slope of which is about 59 mV dec−1. The Tafel slope of 153 mV dec−1 suggests that single-electron transfer to CO2 is the rate-determining step for CO2 reduction to formate on the RAD-Zn electrode. The coverage of intermediates on the surface and mass transport are considered as two factors that may have a significant influence on the Tafel slope. Under optimal conditions, Tafel plots should be recorded at relatively low overpotentials. Otherwise, mass transport of reactants and products between the electrode surface and electrolyte may have a negative effect on the measurement under high overpotentials.19 Efforts have been made to measure formate partial current on RAD-Zn at lower overpotentials, but formate content accumulated in a long reaction time (more than 30 min) is still below the detection limit of ion chromatography at potentials less negative than −0.93 V vs. RHE. Moreover, the same situation also exists for Zn-foil, for we failed to measure formate partial current on Zn-foil even at a potential of −1.23 V vs. RHE. At much more negative potentials, the Tafel slope of formate on the Zn electrode will be much higher than the theoretical value. And at more positive potentials, the Zn electrodes may be chemically oxidized, because it is more thermodynamically likely for metallic Zn to spontaneously react with H2O in forming ZnO and H2.19

Good stability and high catalytic activity are two necessary properties for a catalyst to meet the practical applications. The stability of the RAD-Zn electrode under the experimental conditions was evaluated through a long-term operation at −1.93 V vs. RHE. In the initial 3.5 hours, the concentration of formic acid was detected once every half an hour. Then, it was detected at 1 hour, 1.5 hour, 6 hour and 2 hour intervals, respectively. During the experiments, the electrolyte was continuously used for the whole 14 hours without replacement. As shown in Fig. 8, the RAD-Zn electrode exhibits good stability for current density for over 14 h of the operating program without any significant deterioration. The performance of the RAD-Zn for formate selectivity has a slight decrease after 4.5 h, which may be attributed to the higher coverage of the HCOO− on the surface of the Zn catalyst due to increasing concentrations of the products in the batch reactor. However, the formate faradaic efficiency can remain around 80% during the last long-term 8 h reaction. In a previous report, the decreased product selectivity could be recovered by replacing the electrolyte with a new one.40 Therefore, the RAD-Zn electrode has sufficient potential as a promising catalyst for electrochemical CO2 conversion with a superior production rate of formate and prolonged stability.

Conclusions
In summary, this study has introduced a simple method for the synthesis of Zn catalyst with a rough surface and granular nanostructure. The low-cost catalyst exhibits high performance for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to formate. Electrochemical studies show that this Zn catalyst exhibited faradaic efficiency toward formate as high as 87.1% at an applied potential of −1.93 V vs. RHE, which is almost 8 times higher compared to that of Zn-foil. In addition, this Zn catalyst also exhibits good catalytic activity, reaching a formate partial current density of 12.8 mA cm−2, which is almost 17 times higher than that of Zn-foil. The promotion of catalytic performance is correlated with polycrystalline Zn with catalytically active facets formed by the reduction of polycrystalline ZnO and its special surface structure. In long term experiments, this catalyst remains stable without any significant degradation in current density, and the formate faradaic efficiency could remain around 80%. It can thus be a promising catalyst suitable for practical applications.
