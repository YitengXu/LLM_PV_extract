    , Accepted 17th February 2019First published on 18th February 2019AbstractPerovskite quantum dots (PVQDs) have been demonstrated to be favorable materials for opto-electronic devices regardless of the generally required complicated preparation processes including solvent exchanges. Here, we report a novel convenient and efficient approach to produce CsSnI3 PVQDs through one-pot synthesis. Specifically, the produced PVQD solutions were clear and stable at room temperature after 90 days due to the antioxidant solvent additive (ASA) triphenyl phosphite (TPPi). Interestingly, the corresponding CsSnI3 PVQD-based solar cells achieved the maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.03%, which is the highest performance for all-inorganic lead-free perovskite solar cells reported so far.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have been extensively investigated in the past several years, accompanied with fast increases in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 3.8% (ref. 1) to 23.6%.2 Typically, the active layers of PVSCs are organometallic hybrid perovskites that contain organic cations, such as CH3NH3+ and FA+,3,4 the metal Pb and halogen anions, including I−, Br− and Cl−, with CH3NH3PbI3 acting as the star molecule. However, in addition to the notorious presence of Pb with high toxicity, the chemical and thermal stabilities of CH3NH3PbI3 are not good enough, due to which it easily decomposes upon contact with moisture in air or at temperature near 150 °C.5 Accordingly, considerable environment-friendly lead-free perovskite materials, such as Sn-based perovskites, have been developed.6,7 Especially, the inorganic compound CsSnI3 can meet the requirements of both low toxicity and high thermal stability due to its high decomposition temperature of ∼450 °C.8 As the performances of CsSnI3-based solar cells derived from highly doped crystals with Sn vacancies are not high enough, some tin halides (such as SnF2,9,10 SnCl2 (ref. 11) and excess SnI2 (ref. 12)) were added to decrease the Sn vacancies for the realization of higher PCEs. For example, by using excess SnI2 in CsSnI3 perovskite solar cells to stabilize the Sn2+ state, Kanatzidis et al. obtained the record PCE of 4.81%.12 Some organic additives, such as piperazine,13 were also introduced to enhance the oxidation stability of Sn2+ for obtaining a maximum PCE of 3.83%, and hydroxybenzene sulfonic acids or their salts were used in Sn-based organic perovskites.14
Nanocrystallization and material quantization are important and effective methods to decrease the number of intrinsic defects due to size and autoexclude volume defects.15,16 Also, perovskite quantum dots (PVQDs) have various advantages such as the quantum confinement effect, large exciton binding energy, and high luminous efficiency.17 It might be possible to stabilize the state of CsSnI3 by preparing the corresponding CsSnI3 PVQDs. Several methods including template-based growth,18 hot-injection technique,19 ligand-assisted reprecipitation technique,20 and nonaqueous emulsion synthesis21 have been reported to prepare PVQDs. Pb-based PVQDs with CH3NH3PbX3 and CsPbX3 have been frequently synthesized for use in solar cells and light-emitting diodes.22–24 There are also some reports about PVQDs based on lead-free ions such as Mn2+,25 Sb3+,26 Bi3+,27 and Sn2+.28 However, in previous methods, complex processes, including multiple solvent exchanges for QD generation, separation and purification, are generally required.
From the advantages of PVQDs, also considering the easy preparation, herein, we report a novel simple process to obtain CsSnI3 PVQDs by one-pot synthesis with high efficiency. Due to the addition of an antioxidant solvent additive (ASA) triphenyl phosphite (TPPi) in the precursor solution of CsSnI3, the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ could be restrained during the growth of CsSnI3 perovskite crystals, directly improving the perovskite stability and the device performance. Correspondingly, the maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.03% was achieved using CsSnI3 PVQD-based solar cells, opening a new avenue for the fabrication of highly stable, lead-free, all-inorganic PVQDs with high device performance.
Results and discussion
Preparation of CsSnI3 PVQDs
The one-pot preparation process of CsSnI3 QDs is shown in Fig. 1A; in this process, two parallel solutions without (process 1) or with (process 2) ASA were prepared for comparative investigation. Generally, one-pot synthesis is much desired because it can save time and resources while increasing the chemical yield. Also, it avoids a lengthy separation process and purification of the intermediate chemical compounds in comparison with other synthetic methods for QD production by a solution process.29,30 As shown in Fig. 1A, in process 1, the color of the solution without ASA is bright yellow, and it remains nearly unchanged after a heating treatment at 90 °C for 10 min. In process 2, the solution turns brown-red with the addition of ASA, which is almost the same color as that of the SnI2 powder. With increasing concentration of ASA, the solution color became deeper. After the same heating treatment in process 1, the color of the solution in process 2 further changed to black, which is similar to that of solid CsSnI3. The process of synthesis was conducted in an N2 glovebox. Fig. 1B shows the main reactions of CsSnI3 QDs, which comprise two basic steps: in the first step, SnI2 QDs can be released into the solution after the addition of ASA (TPPi); in the second step, SnI2 QDs react with Cs+ and I− ions during the heating treatment at 90 °C to yield CsSnI3 PVQDs, as shown in text with yellow highlights.

It should be noted that another key point for this preparation is the utilization of TPPi as ASA. According to previous literatures, if CsSnI3 crystals are highly doped with Sn vacancies, the crystals will have a high doping carrier concentration of ∼1017 cm−3 and hole mobility of ∼585 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature, making the crystals have almost metallic properties.8,31 This will seriously affect the utilization of the photo-to-electron transfer, leading to a very low efficiency in the solar cells. Actually, a previous study indicated that the change in the Sn valence state from Sn2+ → Sn4+ would result in the instability and excessive p-type doping of CsSnI3.32 Thus, it is necessary to decrease the reaction of Sn valence state from Sn2+ → Sn4+. As is well-known, TPPi is usually used as a common antioxidant and stabilizer in polymers to prevent oxidative degradation during processing and long-term applications.33,34 Thus, we thought that TPPi would have high ability to capture oxygen for reducing the oxidation reaction of Sn2+ to Sn4+ during the growth of the perovskite films. Also, as an organic phosphine complex, TPPi is strongly hydrophobic and can enhance the stability of the resultant materials against humidity. Therefore, we attempted to utilize TPPi as ASA for the preparation of CsSnI3 PVQDs in this work.
Characterizations and analysis
HRTEM measurements were obtained to demonstrate the production of PVQDs. To clearly describe the results, we have denoted the solutions without ASA, with ASA but without the heating treatment, and both with ASA and the heating treatment as I, II, and III, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1. The HRTEM images of CsSnI3 films are presented in Fig. 2A, and the film from solution II displays a nearly single (133) lattice with an interplanar distance of 0.22 nm (Fig. 2A(II)). However, the film from solution III exhibits QDs with the size of about 10 nm (Fig. 2A(III)). In addition, QDs are anisotropic with different single-crystal lattices such as (220), (110) and (022); the lattices have interplanar distances of 0.32 nm, 0.65 nm and 0.34 nm, respectively. As the solutions were clear and stable, SnI2 and CsSnI3 QDs possibly exhibited very small sizes and negligible aggregation. In Fig. S1,† we compare the UV-vis absorption spectra of the heated CsSnI3 solution with those of 4 vol% ASA and the CsSnI3 film prepared from it. The strong blue shift for the absorption spectra of CsSnI3 solution demonstrates the formation of CsSnI3 QDs with smaller size in the solution. Excitingly, PVQDs were stable in solution for more than 3 months at room temperature, as shown in the right side of Fig. 1A. The formation process is simple, facile and completed by one-pot synthesis. In Fig. S2,† we compare the IR spectra of CsSnI3 QD films from the solutions with and without TPPi, indicating that TPPi is volatilized out during the preparation process and it hardly remains in the film.

(A) HRTEM images of the CsSnI3 film prepared from the solution II: CsSnI3 solution with ASA without the heat treatment (the non-QD film via ASA, shown in the upper part of the figure: A-II) and solution III: from the solution II but after the heat treatment at 90 °C for 10 min (the QD-based films via ASA, shown in the lower part of the figure: A-III). The ASA concentration was 4 vol%. (B) XRD spectra of the CsSnI3 films from precursor solution III with different TPPi concentrations and the standard XRD spectrum in PDF#43-1162 of B-γ-CsSnI3. (C) The UV-vis absorption spectra of the CsSnI3 films from precursor solution III with different TPPi concentrations. 
The XRD pattern shown in Fig. 2B reflects the main characteristic peaks of the reported orthorhombic (Pnam) structure of B-γ-CsSnI3, and its standard XRD spectrum in PDF#43-1162 is shown at the bottom.35–37 Since no ASA is added, the perovskite film has high crystal orientation, as confirmed by the HRTEM results shown in Fig. 3A. When 2 vol% of ASA was introduced, the (022) and (220) reflection peaks increased along with many other reflections. This could be ascribed to the nanocrystallization of the CsSnI3 film, as observed in Fig. S3B.† When the ASA concentration increased to 4 vol%, the (022), (110) and (220) reflections increased and all the other peaks nearly disappeared. When the concentration further increased to 6 vol%, the (022) reflection increased again. The XRD data demonstrated that ASA plays an important role in the crystallization of the CsSnI3 film, and the results are according to TEM and SEM data. Fig. 3C shows the UV-vis spectra of CsSnI3 films with different ASA concentrations. It is easily seen that ASA has a strong effect on the absorption of the CsSnI3 film. As the ASA concentration increased, the absorption intensity largely increased in the range from 600 to 900 nm. The absorption change is beneficial to solar cells because it enhances the absorption of solar light. In the long wavelength range, the enhancement in the absorption is attributed to the aggregation effect of QDs.

(B) 1H NMR spectra of solutions, which are assigned to the changes in TPPi peaks. (C) 1H NMR spectra of solutions, which are assigned to the changes in DMSO peaks. (D) The 31P NMR spectrum of solutions, which is assigned to the peak change of P in TPPi. Solution 1: DMF/DMSO/TPPi, solution 2: DMF/DMSO/CsSnI3, solution 3: DMF/DMSO/CsSnI3/TPPi without the heat treatment, solution 4: DMF/DMSO/CsSnI3/TPPi with the heat treatment, solution 5: DMSO/TPPi, solution 6: DMSO/TPPi/CsSnI3, solution 7: DMSO/TPPi/SnI2. 
The color change of the solution in process 1 indicated that different forms of SnI2 exist in the two solutions of CsI + SnI2 (or CsSnI3) with or without ASA. The single SnI2 solution is yellow, and the color is nearly unchanged even after the addition of ASA (Fig. S4†), implying that the brown-red color in solution II (Fig. 1) can only be obtained from the color of SnI2 QD suspensions. To investigate the forms of SnI2 in solution, Raman measurements were obtained. As shown in Fig. 3A, the characteristic peak at 143.85 cm−1, which can be attributed to the symmetric stretching vibration (covalent bond) of SnI2,38 appears for the SnI2 solution without and with ASA, indicating that there are no influences caused by the added ASA. This is in good accordance with the unchanged solution color before and after the addition of ASA. However, the typical Raman characteristic peaks of SnI2 disappeared for the CsSnI3 solution and its solid film because the ions of Cs+, Sn2+ and I− in CsSnI3 are in an identical inter-combination by ionic bonds. Then, when ASA was added into the CsSnI3 solution, the Raman characteristic peak of SnI2 appeared at 143.85 cm−1, showing that the addition of ASA changes the bond state of SnI2 in the CsSnI3 solution and leads to the formation of SnI2 QDs. While the concentration of ASA increases, the peak of 143.85 cm−1 is significantly strengthened, confirming the increase of SnI2 in solution (Fig. S5†). These results show that there is the same form of SnI2 in solid SnI2 powder as that in the CsSnI3 solution in the presence of ASA. Accordingly, the reaction process of the PVQD production could be proposed to undergo two basic steps (as shown in Fig. 1B): in the first step, SnI2 QDs can be released into the solution after the addition of ASA; in the second step, SnI2 QDs react with Cs+ and I− ions during the heating treatment at 90 °C to yield CsSnI3 PVQDs.
To further disclose how SnI2 QDs are produced, the color changes of different solutions were compared and various NMR measurements were obtained. Fig. S6† shows the color of the solutions with different contents before and after a heating treatment at 90 °C for longer than 10 min. The results demonstrated that DMSO, CsSnI3 and TPPi should exist simultaneously in the solution for the production of QDs. In particular, if TPPi was replaced by TPP, which is the oxidation state of TPPi, the production could not take place, exhibiting the key role of TPPi with the reducibility in this process. Also, the weak oxidizability of DMSO contributed to the formation of SnI2 QDs with the combination of TPPi and ions from CsSnI3. Some more proofs can be found in the related 1H NMR spectra shown in Fig. 3(B and C). Here, four different solution samples were prepared: solution 1 (DMF/DMSO/TPPi), solution 2 (DMF/DMSO/CsSnI3), solution 3 (DMF/DMSO/CsSnI3/TPPi without the heat treatment), and solution 4 (DMF/DMSO/CsSnI3/TPPi with the heat treatment). The 1H NMR data in Fig. 3B refer to the change in TPPi peaks. We can see an obvious change in the peaks from 7.0 to 7.6 ppm for the four solutions. By comparing the spectrum of solution 3 with the ones of solution 1 and solution 2, it can be clearly seen that when CsSnI3 and TPPi are both added to the solution, significantly different peaks appear in the spectrum of solution 3. This implies that TPPi has an intense interaction with the ions from CsSnI3. Because TPPi used as a reducer is an electron donor, it might combine with the cations of Sn2+ or Cs+. After solution 3 undergoes a heating treatment, the peak in the 1H NMR spectrum for solution 4 recovers to that for the state of solution 1 without CsSnI3. This result is attributed to the formation of perovskite CsSnI3 QDs after adding TPPi into the solution and heating the solution, which decreases the interaction of DMSO with ions of Sn2+ or Cs+. This is exactly consistent with the phenomena observed from Fig. 1A. Fig. 3C shows a similar change in peaks referred to DMSO. As an oxidant, DMSO can combine with I− ions. Because Sn2+ does not have the highest valence, it can also have a chance to combine with DMSO. The 31P NMR spectra of solutions, as shown in Fig. 3D, indicate that TPPi has a strong interaction with both SnI2 and CsSnI3 in the solution. These phenomena and results suggest that the interaction of the ions from CsSnI3 combined with DMSO or TPPi reduces the ionic formation and increases the covalence ability of the combination of Sn2+ with I−, leading to the formation of SnI2. Then, upon heat treatment, SnI2 further reacts with Cs+ and I− to produce CsSnI3, which is depicted in Fig. 1B.
In previous reports, it has been proven that additives have significant effects on the quality of perovskite films.39–41 To study the concentration effect of ASA on the film of the CsSnI3 QD array, the SEM images of the morphologies of CsSnI3 films were taken with different ASA concentrations (Fig. S3†). As shown in Fig. S3,† the film from the solution without ASA has a microcrystal with a size of 1 μm. However, when the ASA concentration increased from 0 vol% to 6 vol%, the size of the film crystals decreased from approximately 1 μm (Fig. S3A†) to 100 nm (Fig. S3D†), and the interspaces were enlarged, indicating that ASA has a large effect on the growth of CsSnI3 perovskite films. The nanocrystals of CsSnI3 films from the solution with ASA were mainly grown during this process, in which SnI2 QDs reacted with CsI to produce CsSnI3 QDs in the solution and in turn, CsSnI3 QDs agglomerated into nanocrystals in the film.
Device performances and discussions
To investigate the performance of CsSnI3-based devices, solar cells based on the perovskite films prepared from different CsSnI3 solutions were fabricated. The device structure is shown in Fig. 4A; PEDOT:PSS and PCBM were used as the hole and electron transfer layers, respectively. Fig. 4B shows the cross-section SEM image of perovskite solar cells based on the CsSnI3 films with thickness of 150 nm (shown in the inserted image). It can also be clearly seen that the CsSnI3 film is uniform and compact in a big area. The curves of current density (J)–voltage (V) are shown in Fig. 4C. For the non-QD devices, the device fabricated from a pure CsSnI3 solution showed PCE of 0.022%, while the one from the solution with 4 vol% ASA exhibited an obviously improved PCE of 1.202%. The device with ASA exhibited short circuit current (JSC) of 12.380 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.258 V and filling factor (FF) of 37.63%, while the device without ASA only had JSC of 0.472 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.009 V and FF of 5.32%. For the QD-based devices, PCE was further dramatically enhanced up to 4.13% along with VOC of 0.42 V and JSC of 23.792 mA cm−2. Fig. 4D shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and the corresponding integrated JSC curves. The results of EQE are consistent with those of the J–V curves shown in Fig. 4C.

(C) J–V curves and (D) EQE and JSC calculated from the EQE characteristics of the devices based on the CsSnI3 films prepared from different CsSnI3 precursor solutions. The ASA concentration was 4 vol%. The results are averaged from 30 devices. (E) Statistics of the PCE distribution for devices based on non-QD film and the QD film (every kind of device with 30 samples). (F) The long-time stability of the solar cells based on the non-QD film and the QD film stored in an N2 glove box without encapsulation and measured under AM1.5 conditions. (G) The steady-state measurement of the solar cell based on the QD film continuously measured under AM1.5 illumination. (H) The J–V measurements with forward and reverse scanning for solar cell devices based on the QD film. The TPPi concentration was 4 vol%. 
The PCE of all the devices was the average from the calculation of 30 devices. The PCE distribution is given in Fig. 4E. The sharp fitting curve of QD-based solar cells implies that the QD-based devices are good for high manufacture repeatability as well as an obviously enhanced PCE. The QD-based devices show an average PCE of 4.13% with the highest PCE of 5.03%, which is the highest performance of all-inorganic lead-free perovskite solar cells reported so far. Fig. 4F shows the long-time stability of the solar cells based on the non-QD film and the QD film. The results demonstrate that the QD-based device has higher stability. When it was measured one month later, the non-QD-based device exhibited obvious fluctuant PCE values. The performance increased when the device was stored in an N2 glove box for several days. After 30 days, only 72% of the initial PCE was retained. However, for the device based on the CsSnI3 QD film, PCE exhibited negligible changes after long-time storage and testing. This demonstrated that the decrease in the crystal size down to quantum dots not only leads to the enhancement in PCE but also benefits the device stability. Moreover, when the device was continually measured under AM 1.5 G illumination for a long time, PCE maintained a steady output for over 400 min (Fig. 4G). ASA can greatly enhance the stability of the films. To verify this assumption, XPS measurements were obtained; the results are shown in Fig. S7a (without ASA) and S7b (with ASA).† The XPS measurement for the CsSnI3 film from the solution without ASA shows the 3d5/2 peaks for divalent Sn (∼495.1 and ∼486.8 eV) and peaks at ∼493 and ∼485 eV for zero-valent Sn. However, after the addition of ASA, the XPS spectra exhibit only the 3d5/2 peaks of divalent Sn at 494.5 and 486.0 eV. Additionally, the lower binding energies of the 3d5/2 peaks in Fig. S7b† compared with those in Fig. S7a† indicate a lower concentration of tetravalent Sn. These results demonstrate that the addition of ASA to the precursor solution can significantly enhance the stability of the perovskite films according to the previous literature.42Fig. 4H shows the forward and reverse scanning J–V test curves for the device based on the CsSnI3 QD film, indicating only slight hysteresis character of the device. Compared with the stability of Sn-based perovskite solar cells reported in few previous studies, the stability of the devices in this work was very high.
In order to study the carrier transfer in CsSnI3 films, transient photoluminescence (PL) decay spectra were obtained (Fig. 5A). The spectrum curves can be well fitted using the following biexponential function: (1)Here, parameters τ1 and τ2 represent the one-body recombination process (i.e., electron and/or hole trapping) and the two-body recombination pathway (i.e., PL radiative recombination), respectively.11,43 The calculated value is shown in Table S1.† Obviously, the carrier lifetime of the films from the solution with ASA is longer than that of the films from the solution without ASA. This indicates that the film from the solution with ASA has lower trap and defect concentrations, proving the assumption shown in Fig. S8.† As QDs form in the film, the size confinement effect decreases the defects in crystals. Previous reports have proved that the quantization of perovskite materials can efficiently increase their diffusion lengths and mobility values.44,45 The lower trap and defect concentrations decrease the recombination of photo-induced carriers, necessarily leading to an increase in JSC and a decrease in energy loss. Thus, the device performance improves greatly.

(B) Nyquist plots of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CsSnI3 (from different precursor solutions)/PCBM/Ag devices. The equivalent circuitry is shown in the insets. (C) Schematic for the evolution of the electronic structure of inorganic semiconductors from bulk material to QDs. 
To further investigate the results of the charge transfer in devices, electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also carried out. Fig. 5B shows the Nyquist plots of the devices using different CsSnI3 films measured at 0.1 V under dark conditions. The inset figure shows the equivalent circuit used to fit the tested curves. The equivalent circuit is composed of the contact resistance Rs and the recombination resistance (Rrec).46Rrec represents the charge transfer in the perovskite, which is ascribed to the low-frequency element in EIS, while the values of Rrec are associated with the charge recombination (Fig. 5B and Table S2†). The results illustrate that the addition of ASA into the solutions results in a low charge recombination of films (high Rrec), which is in good accordance with the PL data shown in Fig. 5A. This further proves that ASA in solution has the ability to compress the defects and intrinsic carriers. Rs is associated with HTL-perovskite or the perovskite-ETL (electron transfer layer) interface. In addition, this parameter is affected greatly by the contact of different layers. When the crystals having a large size changed into QDs, the contact area between perovskite QDs and PCBM increased. From the high-frequency part shown in Fig. S9 and Table S2,† the addition of ASA into the solution makes Rs decrease from 16.33 Ω to 15.66 Ω and further to 14.79 Ω for the QD-based device. This indicates better contact and charge transfer between different layers in devices.
Generally, QD materials have different characteristics compared to the corresponding bulk materials because of the size effect and the quantum tunneling effect.44,47 These quantum effects may make the carrier transfer easier and decrease the energy loss during carrier transfer. Fig. 5C shows the schematic of the electronic structure of bulk to QD materials. Another factor for the enhanced performance can be the reduction of Sn vacancies. By a simple spin-coating and annealing treatment, a CsSnI3 film with an orthorhombic (Pnam) structure was produced (Fig. S8†). Traditionally, defects are easily formed in CsSnI3 films prepared by an annealing method, which are disclosed by the Sn cation vacancies and the metallic conductivity properties of the films.8,29,40 The metallic conductivity inhibits the photoelectronic effect of the devices. A high-efficiency opto-electronic device should exhibit strong semi-conductive properties. Due to the antioxidant activity of ASA TPPi, it limits the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ during the growth of the CsSnI3 films, which is very important for obtaining high-performance opto-electronic devices with Sn-based, inorganic perovskite films.
PCE in this study is much lower than that of the previously reported organic metallic halogen PVSCs with PCE up to 23.6% for lead-containing PVSCs2 and 9.0% for lead-free PVSCs.48 However, the advantages of all-inorganic and lead-free PVSCs still attract significant attention because of their long-term stability and non-toxic nature. Especially, during the revision of this paper, Padture et al. reported that all-inorganic lead-free PVSCs exhibited PCE up to 7.11% as well as high stability by using a mixed Sn and Ge perovskite of CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3.49 The film of CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3 was deposited by a thermal evaporation process from its powder, which was synthesized by a solid–state reaction of CsI:SnI2:GeI2 (2:1:1 molar ratio) in evacuated Pyrex tubes. This indicates that PCE of the all-inorganic lead-free PVSCs can be effectively enhanced by some novel methods such as using mixed metals for replacing the pure metal of Sn. In this paper, the preparation of perovskite QDs through the solution process is very simple and convenient in the large-scale and flexible fabrications for future commercial productions.

Preparation of the CsSnI3 solution

All the solutions were stirred for 12 h on a hot plate at 70 °C. In addition, the precursor CsSnI3 QD solutions were prepared by heating on the hot plate at a temperature of 90 °C for more than 10 min. The HMR spectra for different solutions were measured using an NMR spectrometer (Bruker AVANCE III HD 400 MHz).
Fabrication and characterization of the perovskite film
The CsSnI3 films were fabricated on glass substrates. The CsSnI3 solutions were prepared as described above. Each solution was spin-coated on the substrates at a speed of 4000 rpm for 30 seconds. After spin-coating, the precursor films were loaded on a heating station at 90 °C for annealing. The morphology of the films was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, HITACHI S-4700) and transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F30). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to study the valence state changes of Sn. XRD measurements were performed to investigate the structures of the crystals. UV-vis absorption spectra were measured using a U-3010 spectrophotometer (Hitachi) instrument. Time-resolved transient photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using a PL spectrometer, FLS 900, Edinburgh Instruments, excited using a picosecond pulsed diode laser (EPL-445) and measured at 405 nm after excitation.
Fabrication and characterization of the perovskite solar cells
PEDOT:PSS (4083) was spin-coated on an ITO substrate at a speed of 3000 rpm for 30 seconds and annealed on a hot plate at 130 °C for one hour in an N2 glove box. The CsSnI3 solution with or without TPPi mixture was deposited on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer to produce perovskite films via the process described above. After the perovskite film was formed, an electronic transfer material (15 mg of PCBM in 1 ml of chlorobenzene) was spin-coated on top of the perovskite film at a speed of 1500 rpm for 30 seconds. Finally, a silver (Ag) layer (100 nm) was deposited on top of the PCBM layer via a thermal-evaporation process in a vacuum chamber with a pressure of 5 × 10−4 Pa. The typical active area of the devices was approximately 0.12 cm2, which was determined by a shadow mask during the evaporation of the top electrode. The solar light source simulated AM1.5 sun light with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The current density (J)–voltage (V) curves were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter unit. The J–V measurements were carried out in an N2 glove box. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were carried out using a quantum efficiency (QE)/IPCE measurement system (SR830, Stanford Research Systems). A standard Si photodiode calibrated from Hamamatsu was tested as a reference prior to each sample measurement. Steady-state measurements of the solar cell devices were carried out using an electrochemical workstation (CS150H, Wuhan Corrtest Instruments Corp., Ltd.). Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements were obtained using a frequency response analyzer (PSM1735 NumetriQ) from 1 Hz to 106 Hz under dark conditions at 0.1 V applied bias.
Conclusions
In summary, one-pot synthesis was demonstrated to yield inorganic perovskite quantum dots (PVQDs) of CsSnI3 by a simple and mild process. In the preparation process, triphenyl phosphite (TPPi) was used as the antioxidant solvent additive (ASA). The prepared PVQD solutions could remain clear and stable at room temperature for over 90 days. ASA played a key role in the production of QDs and stability. Because of its antioxidant ability, ASA can limit oxidizing reactions during the preparation of perovskite materials and devices, which is beneficial for high efficiency and stability of the devices. Solar cells based on the CsSnI3 QD films exhibited average PCE of 4.13%, with the highest one being 5.03% in addition to perfect stability. The devices showed stable PCE after being stored for 25 days and retained a stable output of PCE under a constant AM1.5 illumination for over 400 min. This work demonstrates that ASA has multiple important roles in the growth of perovskite films and their device performances, providing a simple and mild method to produce highly stable, lead-free, inorganic PVQDs with great potential for high-performance solar cells.
