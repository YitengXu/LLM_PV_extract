    , Accepted 26th June 2013First published on 26th June 2013AbstractFreely-assembled ternary hybrids consisting of Pt, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and P25 were synthesized by a direct solution process with the assistance of UV light. The Pt–RGO/P25 hybrids were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultraviolet visible (UV-vis) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and photoluminescence spectra (PL). Importantly, when Pt–RGO/P25 hybrids were used as photocatalysts, they could show a superior photocatalytic performance when compared to commercial P25 and RGO/P25 hybrids under UV, solar light and λ > 600 nm visible light irradiation, which could be explained on the basis of the plasmonic response and the formation of Pt Schottky barrier at the interface between TiO2 and graphene. This work could provide new insight for enhancing graphene/TiO2 photocatalytic performance and facilitate their application in environmental protection.
Introduction
Remediation of global air and water pollution using photocatalysts is one of the promising solutions to address the increasing demand for energy and the associated environmental concerns.1,2 Owing to its peculiar chemical and physical behaviors,3–6 titanium dioxide (TiO2) is an important photocatalyst which has been extensively investigated in environmental and energy-related fields. However, the rapid recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and the narrow optical response region within TiO2 still limit its practical applications so that suppressing the recombination of charge carriers and extending the optical absorption edge are crucial for the enhancement of its photocatalytic activity. In the past three decades, various strategies, including textural modification, transitional or rare-earth metal doping, heterojunction construction and noble metal deposition, have been developed in an attempt to modify the photocatalytic process7–9 and improve the photocatalytic performance.10–14 In particular, carbon species modified TiO2 hybrid materials have been receiving much attention as a new class of photocatalysts, which could potentially offer desirable efficiency for separating electron–hole pairs and extending the optical absorption.15–18
Recently, owing to the high specific surface area and superior electron mobility of graphene,19 particular attention has been paid to the coupling of graphene with TiO2 which has shown a significant improvement in the photocatalytic ability.20–22 It was considered that graphene can effectively store and shuttle electrons when it was in contact with TiO223,24 owing to its excellent electrical conductivity. Besides, the high specific surface area of graphene can also enhance the affinity with an organic pollutant by π–π interaction.25–27 Although TiO2 (or Degussa P25) hybridized with graphene has a remarkable enhancement in its photocatalytic activity as well as optical response, further enhanced photocatalytic activity for meeting the increasing environmental requirements is still necessary, which is one of the challenges in the photocatalysis field. For instance, a strategy for decreasing the defects of graphene or increasing the interfacial contact would further enhance the photocatalytic activity of graphene/TiO2.28 Coating with up-conversion reagent greatly enhanced the photocatalytic performance of graphene/P25 to the infrared region, maximizing the use of solar energy.29 Combining MoS2 with graphene/TiO2 can efficiently suppress charge recombination, improve interfacial charge transfer, and provide a greater number of active adsorption sites and photocatalytic reaction centers.30
Despite all the advantages in the graphene/TiO2 system, it still suffers from narrowing of the bandgap that limits its photocatalytic activity under solar irradiation.31,32 To expand the absorption edge of TiO2, the surface deposition of noble metals (Ag, Pt, Pd or Au) has attracted much attention because of their strong light absorption in the visible region, which arises from a resonant oscillation of free electrons coupled by light, known as localized surface plasmon resonance (SPR).33 The mechanism of SPR can be described as collective oscillation of electrons on the noble metal particles induced by the incident light transfers conduction electrons (e−) from the noble metal particles to the TiO2 conduction band, and the positively charged noble metal particles receive e− from the electron donor. Therefore, noble metals also act as co-catalysts in photocatalytic reaction; their photocatalytic activity would be significantly enhanced.34–37 A pioneering study by Tsukamoto et al. confirmed that efficient charge transfer could be maximized by loading Au at the anatase–rutile interface; otherwise, single phase TiO2 results in a low photocatalytic activity.12
According to the results mentioned above, constructing a ternary hybrid which consists of a noble metal, graphene and TiO2 would reach a great photocatalytic performance due to both the enhancement of charge transfer and photoabsorption. Herein, we report for the first time the freely-assembled hybrids of graphene/P25 loaded with platinum nanoparticles for photocatalytic decolorization of Rh.B by the photo-assisted method, where P25 is used as a mixed phase of TiO2 (80% anatase and 20% rutile) in order to obtain highly efficient charge transfer at the interface.
Experimental
Materials
Graphite powder (purity 99.9995%) and P25 were obtained from the National Chemical Reagent Ltd, Shanghai, China. Other chemical reagents were purchased from Aldrich without further purification.
Synthesis of the Pt–RGO/P25 hybrid
Here, graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized by the oxidation of graphite powder using the Hummers method.38 0.6 g of P25 was added into a 60 mL solution containing 0.03 g of GO and 20 mL of ethanol as the hole scavenger. The mixture was sonicated thoroughly for 30 min, and different volumes (0.5, 1, 3, 5, and 8 mL) of 0.01 mM H2PtCl2 were then added in the above mixture. The mixture was first stirred for 6 h, and freely-assembled hybrids of Pt–RGO/P25 were subsequently obtained under UV irradiation (λ = 365 nm) for another 4 h and named as 0.5, 1, 3, 5 and 8 Pt–RGO/P25. By this process, both photodeposition of Pt and photoreduction of GO could be achieved.39,40
Characteristics of the Pt–RGO/P25 hybrid
XRD patterns were obtained with a diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan, RINT 2500 V) using Cu Kα radiation. Raman spectra were carried out using a Horiba Jobin Yvon LabRAM using a 100× objective lens with 532 nm laser excitation. Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded using KBr pellets using Bruker FTIR. Diffuse reflectance UV-visible absorption spectra were obtained using a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2401PC) equipped with a diffuse reflectance accessory, and BaSO4 was used as the reference. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a JEM-2200FS microscope with Cs correction. The TEM images were analyzed using Digital Micrograph software. XPS analysis was performed with an ESCALAB-220I-XL (THERMO-ELECTRON, VG Company) device. Photoluminescence was recorded at room temperature using a fluorescence spectrometer (Shimadzu, RF-5410PC). Photocurrent measurements were performed in a homemade three electrode quartz cell. An inert electrode (Pt) was used as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode was used as the reference electrode. The working electrode was the P25, Gr/P25 and 3 Pt–Gr/P25 thin films on ITO with an area of 1.05 × 1.05 cm−2. An ultraviolet lamp (365 nm, 70 mW cm−2) was used for excitation. Measurements of the photocurrent collected were carried out with a potentiostat (CHI660C).
Photocatalytic degradation
In order to analyze the photocatalytic effect, the decomposition reaction of 50 mL Rh.B (10 mg L−1) aqueous solution was carried out. A powdered sample of 30 mg was dispersed in the Rh.B solution under ultrasonication for 1 min, and then kept in the dark for 1.5 h. For the irradiation system, UV light (λ = 365 nm), solar light (Xe lamp, LS-150-Xe, Abet Technologies, Inc., USA) and solar light with a 600 nm cut-off filter were used at the distance of 100 mm from the solution in a dark box. The suspension was irradiated for different irradiation times. Samples were then withdrawn regularly from the reactor and the dispersed powder was removed through centrifugation. The clean transparent solution was analyzed using UV-vis spectroscopy. The concentration of Rh.B in the solution was determined as a function of irradiation time from the absorbance region at a functional wavelength using a (S-3100, Sainco Co. Ltd) spectrometer.
For the degradation of 4-CP aqueous solution (20 mg L−1) as the model, the experimental procedure was completed with the same precursors as the degradation of Rh.B over the 3 Pt–RGO/P25 hybrid, and the results were recorded using a UV-vis spectrophotometer.
Results and discussion
Structure and morphology
The morphological changes from P25 to RGO/P25 to Pt–RGO/P25 were analyzed. As shown in TEM images (Fig. 1a–c), the typical size of P25 particles is around 21 nm (Fig. 1a), which were uniformly distributed on graphene sheets during self-assembly by electrostatic binding or charge transfer interactions (Fig. 1c and d).39 The TEM images show a clear difference between RGO/P25 and Pt–RGO/P25 hybrids. For the Pt–RGO/P25 hybrid (Fig. 1c), cluster-like Pt nanoparticles with the size of around 3 nm are clearly observed. The enlarged TEM image of Pt–RGO/P25 shows deposited Pt nanoparticles not only on P25 nanoparticles, but also on graphene sheets (Fig. 1d). The multi-geometric structures propose a possible mechanism of photocatalytic reaction that the Pt particles could act both as a plasmonic reagent and as a co-catalyst. The HRTEM image of Pt–RGO/P25 hybrids clearly shows Pt particles located at the anatase–rutile interface and well-defined contact surfaces for the Pt/anatase/rutile phases, where the lattice spacing of TiO2 is 0.352 and 0.237 nm for the (101) and (110) planes of anatase, and 0.356 and 0.299 nm for the (110) and (001) planes of rutile (Fig. 1e). Cluster-like Pt nanoparticles could be clearly characterized using the HRTEM image (Fig. 1f), which shows a single-crystalline structure with highly ordered and continuous fringe patterns. The measured interplanar spacing for the lattice fringes is 0.23 nm, which corresponds to the (111) lattice plane of face-centered cubic (fcc) Pt, while the fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern (inset of Fig. 1f) of the HRTEM image (circled part, Fig. 1f) further indicates that Pt is a single crystal. The high dispersibility of TiO2 on graphene sheets could be confirmed by SEM images (Fig. S1†).

As a result, the formation mechanism of Pt–RGO/P25 hybrids could be shown in Scheme 1. P25 is a well-known semiconductor which could be readily excited to charge carriers (electron–hole pairs) by using UV light irradiation. When the hole (h+) is scavenged by ethanol and there is production of ethoxy radicals which in turn transfer electrons to the TiO2 surface, P25 with an electronegative surface can react with functional groups on the GO surface by electrostatic binding and charge transfer interactions to form GO/P25 hybrids.39 Simultaneously, the photogenerated electrons (e−) are injected from the excited P25 into graphene oxide, and due to the good electron acceptor feature of GO, high mobility electrons of GO can easily move throughout each sheet and can reduce it globally.41 In addition, the Pt ions can also accept electrons from excited P2542,43 through graphene sheets as the electron mediator44 or directly by excited GO.45 Therefore, it could be seen that Pt nanoparticles are loaded on the surface of both P25 and RGO.

Fig. 2 shows a comparison of the XRD patterns of GO, P25 and Pt–RGO/P25 hybrids. The characteristic 2θ peak of GO appearing at 11.07° corresponds to a d-spacing of approximately 7.984 Å, which is consistent with the interlayer spacing of GO sheets reported in the literature.46 As can be seen, both anatase and rutile phases of TiO2 are observed in P25 and Pt–RGO/P25 hybrids. Two weak and broad diffraction peaks at 39.8 and 46.3° can be observed in 5 Pt–RGO/P25 and 8 Pt–RGO/P25, indicating the presence of metallic Pt (JCPDS No. 65-2868). For lower Pt ratio, no diffraction peaks of Pt were observed mainly due to the low loading of Pt. In addition, carbon species cannot be observed because of their low amount and the relatively low diffraction intensity of graphene.

XPS is a quantitative spectroscopic technique that measures the elemental composition and chemical state. The full XPS spectrum of 3 Pt–RGO/P25 reveals the peaks of Ti, O, Pt and C elements (Fig. 2a). Four peaks located at 284.5, 285.6, 286.7, and 288.4 eV in the C1s deconvolution spectrum of GO correspond to the C–C, C–OH, C–O, and O–CO (–COO–) groups, respectively (Fig. S2†).47 Compared with GO, the intensity of the “carbon–oxygen” functional groups in 3 Pt–RGO/P25 is significantly reduced (Fig. 2b), suggesting a considerable reduction of GO to graphene by injected electrons from excited TiO2 under UV light. FT-IR spectra of GO and Pt–Gr/P25 hybrids further confirmed the reduction of GO (Fig. S3†). With respect to the XPS spectrum of O1s in Fig. 2c, three peaks at 530.6, 532.4, and 533.4 eV have been fitted, which are ascribed to Ti–O–Ti, Ti–OH, and C–O–C, respectively.48 Ti 2p XPS peaks of the pure TiO2 with a slight asymmetry are narrow and have a binding energy of 459 eV attributed to Ti4+ (Fig. 3d). Compared with the typical Ti 2p signal of Ti4+ oxidation state, the bands centered at binding energies of 463.7 and 458.1 eV are assigned to Ti2p3/2 and Ti2p1/2 of P25; a negative shift of binding energy suggests a relatively lower oxidation state of titanium,49 which might be surrounded by carbon and oxygen atoms. In the inset of Fig. 3d, it is found that two peaks at 73.4 and 76.8 eV can be easily observed, assigned to Pt 4f7/2 and 4f5/2, respectively (Fig. 4).

The Pt–RGO/P25 hybrids are investigated using Raman spectroscopy, which displays two prominent peaks at 1341 and 1597 cm−1 corresponding to the well-documented D and G bands for graphitized structures. Some characteristic bands at 148, 399, 518, and 639 cm−1 correspond to the Eg(1), B1 g(1), A1 g + B1 g(2), and Eg(2) modes of anatase TiO2. Significantly, the observed D and G bands of the Pt–RGO/P25 hybrid slightly shifted in comparison with the D band (1344 cm−1) and G band (1601 cm−1) of GO, and the D/G intensity ratio is enhanced, indicating the reduction of GO and chemical interaction between P25 and graphene.50,51
Optoelectronic properties analysis
Diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectra are used to detect the absorption region of photons for P25 and Pt–RGO/P25 hybrids, as shown in Fig. 5. As expected, P25 shows the characteristic absorption sharp edge rising at 410 nm, indicating that the absorption region of bare P25 is mainly in high-energy photons. Pt–RGO/P25 hybrids present an increased light absorption intensity in the UV region with a red shift (∼25 nm) to higher wavelength at the absorption edge, which presumably is due to the chemical interaction between graphene and P25 leading to narrowing of the bandgap; an analogous case is found in TiO2/CNT and other TiO2/graphene hybrids.52–54 In addition, visible light absorption of TiO2 is obviously enhanced with an increase of Pt loading. The enhancement of the visible-light absorption peak is due to the fact that the incident photon frequency is resonant with the collective excitations of the conduction electrons of Pt nanoparticles, called the localized SPR.55 The absorption increases in the visible-light region confirm loaded Pt on the TiO2 surface.

Photoluminescence is a process in which a substance absorbs photons (electromagnetic radiation) and then re-radiates photons. Here, the photoluminescence is employed to study the surface structure and the excited state of P25 and Pt–RGO/P25 hybrids (Fig. 6). The peak at 366 nm retards direct recombination from the conduction band (CB) to the valence band (VB),56 which is larger than the forbidden gap because TiO2 is an indirect gap semiconductor.57 Because the indirect surface recombination is much faster than the direct one, most of the photoinduced carriers can diffuse to the surface within their life span and recombine by surface recombination. Also, the carriers left recombine indirectly preferentially, so the peak at 366 nm disappears.58 A gradual emission quenching for peaks at 366 nm is clearly observed in the spectra of Pt–RGO/P25 hybrids with increasing Pt contents, showing that Pt nanoparticles accelerate indirect electron transfer from excited TiO2.

To further examine the photo-generated electronic transfer performance, slurries containing the P25, RGO/P25 with or without Pd loading were dip-coated onto an indium–tin oxide (ITO) glass electrode. The photocurrent action spectra recorded on the ITO/P25, ITO/RGO/P25 and ITO/Pt–RGO/P25 electrodes are shown in Fig. 7. Upon irradiation with UV light, a photocurrent of 0.012 mA is obtained on the ITO/P25 electrode, and the photocurrent response is rapid and reproducible during repeated on/off cycles of irradiation. The photocurrent of the ITO/RGO/P25 electrodes is five-fold that of the ITO/P25 electrode. This suggests that electron–hole pairs from excited TiO2 can be separated and transferred to the external circuit quickly. As expected, a further improvement of electron transfer results in a photocurrent enhancement of 1.7 times in the presence of Pt, suggesting a great reduction of the amount of electron accumulation.

Rh.B, an important organic dye, has been widely applied in textiles, food additives, etc. It is usually regarded as an environmental pollutant. The photocatalytic activities of P25, RGO/P25 and Pt–RGO/P25 are first measured by photodecolorization of Rh.B as a model reaction under UV and simulated sunlight. Before irradiation, time-online adsorption testing is carried out to estimate the adsorbability of the Pt–RGO/P25 hybrid (Fig. S4†). It is clear that keeping an adsorption reaction in the dark for 2 h could ensure the establishment of the adsorption–desorption equilibrium. Compared to P25, larger amounts of Rh.B molecules are pre-adsorbed on RGO/P25 and Pt–RGO/P25 due to the introduction of graphene. For a highly efficient photocatalyst for the decolorization of an organic dye, adsorbability is a prerequisite to obtain an advanced photocatalytic result.59,60
Under UV irradiation, it is evident that the Pt–RGO/P25 hybrids show significant improvements in the photodecolorization of Rh.B as compared to P25, Pt–P25 and RGO/P25, and the optimum amount could be reflected on 3 Pt–RGO/P25 samples. It is believed that the positive synergetic effect between the Pt and graphene sheets as the components of a cocatalyst on the photocatalytic activity can efficiently suppress charge recombination, improve interfacial charge transfer and provide a greater number of active adsorption sites and photocatalytic reaction centers (Fig. 8a). Previous studies have shown that the CB electrons of TiO2 can be injected into graphene sheets at the graphene–TiO2 interface because the work function of graphene is slightly lower than the CB of anatase TiO2. Therefore, when Pt is loaded on the graphene sheet, it will trap electrons from graphene, which accelerates the generation of oxygen radicals due to high active sites of Pt.61 Similarly, loading Pt species on the TiO2 surface also has a positive synergetic effect, which serves as an electron separator and a source of active reaction sites.

(d) Effect of the reuse of 3 Pt–RGO/P25 on the decolorization efficiency of Rh.B under λ > 600 nm irradiation. 
To confirm the Pt–RGO/P25 hybrid as a plasmonic photocatalyst, photodecolorization of Rh.B is carried out over P25, 3 Pt–P25, RGO/P25 and Pt–RGO/P25 under solar simulated irradiation. It is evident from Fig. 8b that the Pt–RGO/P25 hybrids show a significant improvement in the photodecolorization of Rh.B as compared to P25, Pt–P25, and RGO/P25 and the best photocatalytic performance is found in 3 Pt–RGO/P25 samples. The testing results indicate highly efficient utilization of solar energy over Pt-loaded RGO/P25; however, Pt could not be exactly considered as the plasmonic reagent since RGO/P25 also shows an obvious enhancement in the photodecolorization of Rh.B as compared to bare P25. Herein, the irradiated wavelength of solar simulation was cut to more than 600 nm using cutoff filters, and photocatalytic performances of P25, 3 Pt–P25, RGO/P25 and 3 Pt–RGO/P25 were characterized under these conditions. As shown in Fig. 8c, both P25 and RGO/P25 only show exceptionally low photocatalytic performance under irradiation of more than 600 nm, whereas the Pt–P25 and Pt–RGO/P25 hybrids still have a certain photocatalytic activity under λ > 600 nm irradiation. Incidentally, Rh.B is not a suitable test substrate to evaluate the photocatalytic performance since the Rh.B decolorization is affected by the sensitized path on the semiconductor because the excited wavelength reaches around 553 nm, which complicates the mechanism of Rh.B decolorization. However, under λ > 600 nm irradiation, the sensitized path by excited Rh.B molecules could be eliminated, remaining a satisfied reference for the actual photocatalytic performance of the photocatalyst. As a result, both P25 and RGO/P25 do not have obvious effectiveness for the photodecolorization of Rh.B, whereas 3 Pt–P25 and 3 Pt–RGO/P25 can respectively achieve ∼17 and 30% decolorization, indicating a plasmonic response by Pt loading in Pt–P25 or Pt–RGO/P25 hybrids. In addition, the photodecolorization of Rh.B was monitored for three cycles. After each cycle, 3 Pt–RGO/P25 was filtrated and dried thoroughly, and then fresh Rh.B solution was added. The photodecolorization efficiency remains constant during the three consecutive cycles under λ > 600 nm irradiation (Fig. 8d), indicating that as-prepared Pt–RGO/P25 hybrids have stable plasmonic responses. Fig. S5 and S6† show the absorption changes of Rh.B during the photocatalytic decolorization in the presence of P25 and 3 Pt–RGO/P25 hybrids in the wavelength range from 250 to 700 nm under UV and λ > 600 nm irradiation. The absorption peaks of Rh.B decrease with UV irradiation as a function of time in the presence of the P25 but there is no shift. The 3 Pt–RGO/P25 shows a large decrease in the absorbance simultaneously with a large blue shift in λmax during visible light irradiation. The results can be related to the intermediate by-product of the Rh.B molecule occurring in competition with the degradation of the Rh.B chromophore ring under visible light.62 However, both P25 and 3 Pt–RGO/P25 do not show a blue shift in λmax during λ > 600 nm irradiation. In summary, there are two crucial factors that can assist P25 to work as a visible light active catalyst. The first one is the surface plasmon absorption of Pt in the visible region, which can be utilized for visible light irradiation of the photocatalyst, and another is the position of the SPR band, which is considered to be above the CB of TiO2. Under visible light absorption, the plasmon-induced photoexcited electrons in Pt of Pt–RGO/P25 move through the Pt–P25 interface into the CB of TiO2. The electrons in the CB of TiO2 can produce superoxide radicals, which can be used for the degradation of Rh.B (Scheme 2).

4-Chlorophenol (4-CP) is widely generated from a series of industrial processes, such as the manufacture of plastics, resins, textile, steel and paper, high-temperature coal conversion and petroleum refining.63 The reaction rate constant of 4-CP with radicals is 7.6 × 109 M−1 s−1,64 whereas that with ozone alone is only 3.4 × 106 M−1 s−1.65 Therefore, the photocatalytic effectiveness for degradation of 4-CP over a photocatalyst is important for environment protection. Herein, the best photoactive 3 Pt–RGO/P25 hybrid is used to investigate the dechlorinating effect under solar light. A decrease of absorbance at a wavelength of 280 nm is observed with increasing irradiation time (Fig. 9), confirming a possibility of degradation of 4-CP.

Conclusions
To sum up, freely-assembled Pt–RGO/P25 hybrids were synthesized by a direct solution process with the assistance of UV light. On the basis of TEM, XPS, UV-DRS and PL analyses, Pt nanoparticles were not only located at the graphene surface, but also distributed on the TiO2 surface, and they favored a highly efficient charge separation rate based on the electron transfer and plasmonic response to high wavelength. This work provides a facile approach to synthesize a novel graphene-based photocatalyst with a high photocatalytic activity and gives more direct evidence for both intensified charge separation and visible light response.
