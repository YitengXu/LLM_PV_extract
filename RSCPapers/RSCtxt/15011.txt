A key advantage of perovskites over more established semiconductor technologies is solution processability, which reduces processing costs and enables rapid production by roll-to-roll printing. However, metal halide perovskites suffer from poor thermomechanical and chemical stability that must be overcome for successful commercialization of perovskite-based technologies. These instabilities have been shown to stem from defect states present at perovskite interfaces, and particularly grain boundaries, that result in destructive trap states. This review focuses on one successful strategy—organic additive engineering—that has been demonstrated to inhibit the formation of defect sites in perovskite films. This review begins by discussing defects present at grain boundaries—e.g., undercoordinated bonds, vacancies, and antisites—that develop during crystallization, and how these defects lead to reduced device performance via non-radiative recombination and hysteresis, as well as poor chemical and thermal stability. The bulk of this review is dedicated to additive engineering strategies to enhance performance and stability in 3D, quasi-2D, and 2D perovskites. Lewis acid–base interactions between the additives and perovskite constituents are highlighted, with additives ranging from small molecules and solvents to polymers. Special attention is paid to Lewis base additives containing amino and/or carbonyl functional groups, and a short discussion on semiconducting additives for improved charge transport is also included. This review concludes by identifying several areas of further discovery in organic additives for metal halide perovskites.Yanan LiYanan Li completed her BS in Chemistry at Nanjing Normal University in 2015, before earning her MS in Inorganic Chemistry at Beijing Normal University in 2018.

1. Introduction
Metal halide perovskites are promising low-cost, solution-processed semiconductors with a wide range of applications in next-generation solar cells,1–4 light-emitting diodes (LEDs),5,6 thin-film transistors (TFTs),7–11 and lasers.12,13 Metal halide perovskites—or simply “perovskites” as they are colloquially dubbed—typically comprise a structure of ABX3, where A is a monovalent organic (e.g., methylammonium or formamidinium) or inorganic (e.g., Cs+ or Rb+) cation, B is a divalent metal cation (e.g., Pb2+ or Sn2+), and X is a halide anion (e.g., I−, Br−, or Cl−). First synthesized by Weber in 1978, methylammonium perovskite (CH3NH3PbX3 where X = I, Br, or Cl) was observed to display intense color, but without significant conductivity.14 Over 30 years later, in 2009, these materials were demonstrated to be useful as photovoltaic absorbers in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) by Miyasaka and coworkers.15 These DSSCs achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.8%, and marked the beginning of the field of metal halide perovskite photovoltaics.16,17 Perovskites have since been found to exhibit excellent optoelectronic properties such as high charge-carrier mobilities and absorption coefficients,18 direct and tunable band gaps,19 and long carrier-diffusion lengths.20,21 These optoelectronic properties are dependent on composition and phase and can be readily tuned;22–24 for example, increasing the concentration of bromine (relative to iodine) in perovskite transforms the phase from tetragonal to cubic, leading to an increased band gap and blueshifted absorption and emission spectra.23,25 Following a decade of rapid development, the certified PCEs of single-junction perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have increased to over 25%.26,27 Even higher efficiencies—above 29%—have been achieved in perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells.27
Beyond photovoltaics, significant progress has been made in other perovskite-based electronic devices, such as LEDs and TFTs. Applications in LEDs are of interest due to the high color purity, low nonradiative recombination rates, and tunable band gap of perovskites.28–30 In the past five years, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of perovskite LEDs has increased from 0.125% to above 20%, and the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) has been enhanced by composition and structural engineering.5,30–32 Despite being solution processed, perovskites have theoretically predicted mobility values on the order of vacuum processed semiconductors such as GaAs, making them interesting semiconductors for high-performance and low-cost TFTs.33 The first report of perovskite TFTs was in 1999 by Dimitrakopolous and coworkers, who fabricated a device comprising a 2D layered organic–inorganic perovskite (C6H5C2H4NH3)2SnI4 semiconductor with a measured mobility of 0.6 cm2 V−1 s−1.7 Since then, many approaches have been applied to improve the performance of TFTs, such as tuning the composition of perovskites,34 optimizing interface characteristics,35 and using high-mobility additives comprising graphene36,37 or carbon nanotubes.38 TFTs incorporating graphene and carbon nanotubes have resulted in hole (electron) mobilities of 212 cm2 V−1 s−1 (141 cm2 V−1 s−1) and 595.3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (108.7 cm2 V−1 s−1), respectively.36,39
Despite the excellent optoelectronic and semiconducting properties exhibited by perovskites, poor material reliability remains a major barrier to commercialization.39–45 Efforts have been made to improve the performance and stability of perovskite-based electronics through additive engineering,46–48 interface engineering,49–51 composition tuning,42,52,53 film stress reduction,54 and barrier incorporation.55–57 Among these approaches, additive engineering has been demonstrated to be a simple and highly effective method to fabricate high-quality perovskite films and achieve high performance.
In this review, we will discuss the chemical interactions between organic additives and perovskites which drive improved performance and stability in perovskite-based semiconductors (Fig. 1). We focus only on additives introduced into the perovskite layer rather than at the interfaces with transport layers to provide insight on perovskite-additive chemical interactions. We first present a brief overview on some of the key factors of perovskites that limit their performance and stability (Section 2). Next, we discuss the structure and chemical properties of common additives applied directly into the perovskite layers for 3D (Sections 3.1 for small molecules, 3.2 for polymers) and 2D and quasi-2D perovskites (Section 3.3), and how these properties effect film quality, performance, and stability. We then present several areas of organic additives research that we believe warrant further exploration in Section 4. Finally, we summarize the key advantages of organic additive engineering and provide an outlook on the research trends for the future development.
 Fig. 1  Organic additives add many dimensions of functionality that can work in concert to tune the properties of perovskite films and devices. In this review, we will discuss how these factors have been demonstrated to affect grain size, crystallite orientation, morphology, performance, and stability. 
2. Defects in perovskites
One of the most advantageous properties of metal halide perovskites is that they are solution-processable, which makes device fabrication amenable to a variety of processes, including spin-coating,2,4,6,8,12 slot-die coating,58–61 doctor blading,62–65 spray coating,65,66 and spray plasma processing.67,68 While many of these processes are favorable for scalable and low-cost fabrication, deposition from solution phase results in a polycrystalline material with grains ranging on the order of a few hundred nanometers to tens of microns. Surrounding these grains are grain boundaries that house defects such as under-coordinated bonds, vacancies, and antisite defects that behave as nonradiative recombination centers which are deleterious to device stability.69,70 For example, under ambient conditions, polycrystalline perovskite can degrade in hours or days, while single crystalline perovskite, with no internal grain boundaries has been observed to be stable for years.45
Minimizing nonradiative recombination will improve device stability and is also necessary for optimizing photovoltaic performance. Ideal active materials for solar cells need to be excellent both as photoabsorbers and photoemitters; nonradiative recombination reduces emission and, with it, photovoltaic performance.71 While the concept that excellent emitters make excellent absorbers might seem counter-intuitive, an internal luminescence efficiency of 100% at Voc is necessary to reach the Shockley–Queisser limit (∼33.5% for a single junction photovoltaic).71 Achieving high internal luminescence efficiency requires photons generated by recombined excitons to be absorbed and emitted several times before escape. Any nonradiative recombination that occurs has detrimental effects on Voc, limiting device performance to well below the Shockley–Queisser limit.71
2.1 Perovskite crystallization
During MAPbI3 perovskite formation from methylammonium iodide (MAI) and lead iodide precursors, the iodide (I−) in the MAI reacts strongly as an electron donor to Pb2+. If left uncontrolled, this reaction occurs rapidly, forming perovskite with large needle-like structures and pinhole-riddled films.72 The needle-like structure formation is driven by the solubility differences in organic solvents of PbI2 and MAI, which have different crystalline growth rates as solvent is rapidly driven off.72 Controlling the crystalline growth rate can improve the quality of films and eliminate needle-like growth and resultant pinholes.
Perovskite crystal growth is initiated by nucleation, which is a thermodynamically-driven process that can occur through two pathways: (1) homogeneous nucleation in the bulk of the solution; or (2) heterogeneous nucleation at an impurity site (e.g., liquid/gas or liquid/solid interface). The free energy of homogeneous nucleation is a function of the radius of the nucleus, r, and can be described by eqn (1):73–75 (1)where ΔGS is the difference in free energy between the particle surface and bulk solution, ΔGV is the difference in free energy per unit volume between the particle and precursors in solution, γ is the surface free energy of the particle per unit area. In homogeneous nucleation, the critical radius for nuclei, rc, before they are stable is expressed by:72,73 (2)
If rc is not reached, the nuclei will re-dissolve into the solution, thus lowering the free energy (Fig. 2a).

In heterogeneous nucleation, the process occurs at an impurity site (e.g., liquid/gas or liquid/solid interface), and the interfacial contact angle between the liquid and impurity, θ, must be considered. The free energy of heterogeneous nucleation, ΔGhetero, is expressed by eqn (3):72–74 (3)
There is no θ value for which the expression  is greater than one; therefore, the free energy barrier for heterogeneous nucleation is always lower than for homogeneous nucleation. As θ decreases, the free energy barrier is further reduced and solutions that wet substrates more favorably lead to increased rates of heterogeneous nucleation. In general, nucleation accelerates when the solution is highly supersaturated at high temperatures and the surface free energy of the crystal is low.
Once nuclei form, they begin to grow into crystals as reacting species diffuse from the bulk solution to the nuclei surface where they react to form bonds (Fig. 2b).73,74 The diffusion from the bulk solution can be described by Fick's law:75 J = −DA∇M(4)where J is the solute flux to the crystallite surface, D is the diffusion coefficient of the solute in the surrounding media, A is the surface area of the particle, and M is the solute concentration. The reactant flux is equal to the reaction rate at the surface, and the rate of solute consumption can be calculated by:75 J = Ak([M]s − [M]r)(5)where k is the surface reaction rate constant, [M]s is the concentration of the solute at the growing particle–solution interface and [M]r is the solubility of the particle as a function of r. The flux of solute to the crystallite surface is a consequence of the concentration gradient that forms due to the difference in chemical potential between the surface and the bulk solution.
Perovskite crystallites undergo competitive growth via Ostwald ripening, a process in which the total free energy of a particle system is minimized by the reduction of total interfacial area—i.e., the consumption of smaller particles by larger particles.76 Additionally, small perovskite crystallites have a higher solubility than larger ones as a result of their increased interfacial energy with curvature, causing the phase equilibrium to shift towards the larger crystallites. This negative relationship between solubility and particle radius can be understood by the Gibbs–Thomson relation:75 (6)where [M]∞ is the solubility of a particle with infinite radius (flat surface), Vm is the molar volume of the solute, and R is the gas constant. The relationship between particle radius and solubility can be approximated as inversely proportional with  much less than unity. The free energy at the crystallite surface is higher than the free energy of the bulk crystal, making smaller particles—which have a proportionally greater surface area than larger molecules—less energetically favorable and facilitating larger particle growth.
Ostwald ripening has been taken advantage of through post-processing of perovskite films through solvent annealing.77–79 In one example, Wei and coworkers inhibited solvent evaporation during the annealing process by coating a perovskite film with a layer of PC61BM.77 The trapped solvent dissolved the small grains with their relatively higher chemical potential more readily than the larger grains, leading to high local concentrations of precursors. The resultant concentration gradient drove diffusion of the dissolved components to the larger grains and facilitated their coarsening.
Another processing method to influence the crystallization of perovskites is through the anti-solvent crystallization method,80–82 first demonstrated in 2014 by Spiccia and coworkers.82 Anti-solvents are typically nonpolar solvents (e.g., chlorobenzene, toluene, or ethyl ether) in which perovskites and their precursors are insoluble, but with which their host solvent is miscible. The anti-solvents are typically dripped onto the substrates during spin-coating, increasing the solution supersaturation and inducing rapid nucleation, resulting in high-density and pinhole-free films.83 However, the high density of nuclei and rapid crystal growth frequently result in smaller grains and larger grain boundary areas.84 Liu and coworkers showed that finer control of the crystallization kinetics of the anti-solvent method could be gained by using co-anti-solvents.84 In this case, ethyl ether and n-hexane were used with ethyl ether promoting perovskite nucleation, and n-hexane slowing down the rate of crystallization due to its immiscibility with the precursor host solvent, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF).
Perhaps the most scalable method to control the growth of perovskite crystals is incorporating additives that can form intermediate adducts with perovskite precursors through Lewis acid–base interactions, which act to retard the growth process.72,85–87 These interactions also reduce the free energy of nucleation—accelerating the rate of nucleation—and facilitate the formation of uniform perovskite films with less defects.72,86–88 Additives which form Lewis acid–base pairs with perovskite precursors will be elaborated in later Section 3.1.1.
2.2 Hysteresis and trap states in perovskite devices
Perovskite photovoltaic devices have been plagued by hysteresis—i.e., the dependence of I–V characteristics on the direction of the voltage sweep during the photocurrent measurement—since the development of the first devices. Typically, when the photocurrent is measured from a forward to reverse bias, the Jsc and Voc are higher than if the voltage is measured from a reverse to forward bias (Fig. 3a). This hysteresis occurs in part due to synergistic effects of ion migration and charge trapping (i.e., trap states) increasing nonradiative carrier recombination (Fig. 3b–e).69,89–93

The first of these synergistic effects, ion migration, occurs predominantly at the grain boundaries of the perovskite rather than inside the grains. High resolution mapping of J–V hysteresis in PSCs has shown that the ion migration at the grain boundaries results in a local hysteresis that is larger than within the grains.94 Migration can occur through different defect states, such as antisite (i.e., an atom in the incorrect lattice position), vacancy (i.e., an atom missing from a lattice site), or interstitial (i.e., an atom is incorrectly in an interstitial site) defects. Antisite defects are energetically unstable in perovskites and quickly become vacancy and interstitial defects (typically iodine).69 The halide ion vacancies and interstitials are readily mobile due to relatively low migration activation energies, ranging from ∼0.1 eV in triiodide perovskites up to ∼0.3 eV in mixed halide perovskites.69,95,96 Conversely, the migration activation energy of MA and Pb vacancies are several times larger (0.5 and 0.8 eV, respectively), leading to much slower diffusion.69 The slower moving MA and Pb vacancies might contribute to the slow photoresponse, hysteresis, and the curve shape dependence on current sweep rate observed in perovskite solar cells.89,97,98 Vacancies are also deleterious to perovskite stability, providing sites for the migration of oxygen into the lattice, which is catalyzed to form superoxide species (O2−) that can readily deprotonate the organic cation.99,100
The second of the synergistic effects, trap states at the surface and grain boundaries of perovskite contribute significantly to hysteresis.92 Probing of the trap state landscape of MAPbI3 by thermally stimulated currents identified deep trap states with an activation energy of ∼500 meV and a concentration of at least 1 × 1015 cm−3.101 Lower trap densities of states (1 × 1011 to 1 × 1013 cm−3) in polycrystalline perovskites have also been reported by others.92 Deep charge trap states act as Shockley–Hall–Read nonradiative recombination centers, reducing Voc (due to short minority carrier lifetimes), which in turn reduces device efficiency.102–104 This concept was observed by Leijtens et al. when they compared planar perovskite to meso-superstructured solar cells (i.e., perovskite in a porous Al2O3 scaffold).105 Despite the observed higher carrier mobility and emissivity of the planar devices, meso-superstructured solar cells exhibited higher efficiencies. The reduced efficiency of planar devices stemmed from decreased photovoltages, which could be attributed to a high density of uniformly distributed sub-band gap empty trap states.105 In this case, electrons were the trapped species, leading to an accumulation of holes in the film.
The concentration of trap states varies depending on the perovskite composition; for example, Yuan et al. reported the concentration of deep trap states in CsPbI2Br to be greater than 6 × 1016 cm−3, higher than that of MAPbI3 by at least an order of magnitude.106 In this case, excess halide ions on the perovskite surface caused deep trap states to form. Adding free Pb2+ to the surface passivated the ions and reduced the density of trap states by almost 20%, which in turn decreased nonradiative recombination and allowed holes to diffuse more freely to the hole transport layer.106
Density functional calculations by Du indicated that deep trap states in perovskite are predominantly due to iodine vacancies, but the formation of these vacancies could be prevented by alloying with chloride. Adding chloride to perovskite was predicted to increase the formation energy of iodine vacancies by at least 0.43 eV, greatly reducing their occurrence.107 Subsequent experimental work supported this prediction and showed that mixed halide perovskites—i.e., MAPb(BrxI1−x)3−yCly—exhibited increased recombination resistance, resulting in improved Voc.108 Bromine-free mixed halide perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3−xClx) also showed a reduction in trap states by an order of magnitude when compared to CH3NH3PbI3.109 Interestingly, Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS) probing of these samples indicated nearly identical densities of trap states; however, the UPS technique is sensitive only to the surface of the material being probed, indicating that the difference in the densities of trap states between these samples was due to sub-surface effects in the bulk of the films.109 Alloying with chloride also increases the grain size by an order of magnitude (hundreds of nms for CH3NH3PbI3 and microns for CH3NH3PbI3−xClx) without affecting the crystalline structure. Coupled with the increase in grain size is a proportional decrease in grain boundary area, suggesting that the reduction of grain boundaries area reduces the density of trap states.110,111 Chloride alloying has also been shown to decrease the number of antisites at the interface of the perovskite and the electron transport layer (ETL)—e.g., at the interface of Cs0.05FA0.81MA0.14PbI2.55Br0.45 and TiO2—resulting in reduced nonradiative recombination at the interface and hysteresis-free device efficiencies of 20.1%.103
Light-soaking (or prolonged illumination) of devices also reduces bulk deep trap states and subsequently increases PL and Voc, due to the photo-induced diffusion of halides.95,96 Photo-induced diffusion in mixed halide perovskites such as CH3NH3Pb(BrxI1−x)3 results in separate iodide and bromide rich domains.95 Upon illumination with a laser, there has been an observed halide redistribution with iodide diffusing away from the highest intensity illumination. Light-soaking devices with a simulated solar spectrum (AM 1.5) for 15 minutes was observed to beneficially decrease the density of trap states from ∼1.7 × 1017 cm−3 to ∼2.5 × 1016 cm−3;96 however, these trap state densities were still 6 orders of magnitude greater than found in single crystal perovskite.21,112
A further challenge in perovskite devices is that the density of trap states increases as the devices age, leading to more carrier recombination and significantly decreased efficiency.113 In perovskites, this effect can occur rather quickly. For example, Mbengue and coworkers observed a 36% decrease in efficiency was observed in unencapsulated MAPbI3 devices exposed to ambient conditions over just seven days, which was attributed to increased carrier recombination, and was correlated to an observed decrease in the (310) peak relative to the (110) XRD peak observed in degraded perovskite.113 A reduction of the (310) peak intensity indicates local deformations of the perovskite crystal structure, possibly due to ion migration forming vacancy and interstitial defects.113,114
2.3 Moisture-driven degradation of perovskite
Moisture ingress into perovskite films can result in destructive hydration of the perovskite phases, converting them to poor photoabsorbers; for example, MAPbI3 has a rich black color, but upon being hydrated it converts to a yellow or colorless film.115–117 In humid environments, the relative stability of perovskite films to moisture is correlated with grain size, with perovskite films comprising larger grains exhibiting greater PCE retention than those with smaller grains when exposed to moist environments.118 Given that the grain size and grain boundary area are inversely related, the improved stability of large-grained perovskites strongly suggests that perovskite degradation occurs fastest at grain boundaries (Fig. 4a).

(d) (Top) Integrated area of the O–H stretching vibration in the range of 3360–3600 cm−1 and (bottom) the peak positions of N–H stretching vibrations both show significant changes at 10% RH, which then remain constant up to 50% RH.

Indeed, Huang and coworkers observed an amorphous intergranular layer ∼5 nm thick that allowed moisture to diffuse readily into the perovskite.45 The authors also directly studied the effects of perovskite grain size on device stability to moisture. Perovskite films with average grain sizes ranging from 297 to 678 nm were aged at room temperature and 85% relative humidity (RH). As the samples aged, the fraction of the perovskite that degraded in color from black to colorless was monitored. In samples with smaller grains, ∼85% of the film was observed to be colorless after 7 h, while in samples with larger grains, only ∼10% of the film was found to degrade. Interestingly, the conversion to hydrated perovskite was reversible when only 5–10% of the film degraded, but irreversible once 30% or more of the film degraded. These observations were found to be independent of fabrication technique and held for different processing methods such as spin-coating, doctor-blading, vapor-assisted solution processing, and drop-coating (grain sizes ranged from 200 to 1600 nm). The rate of degradation, determined by the time it took for 5% of the film to degrade to colorless, strongly correlated with grain size (Fig. 4b). This correlation was also observed for greater extents of degradation. Furthermore, the degradation rate was found to correlate only with the grain size and was independent of the film thickness, indicating that the fastest mode of degradation is in-plane rather than top-down. Using these observations, a model correlating grain size to degradation rate was developed: (7)where a is the average grain size, v is the grain degradation rate, S is the total film area, and ΔS is the degraded area.
Perovskite hydration to form MAPbI3·H2O is a rapid process that can occur on the order of seconds.119,120 This hydration is fully reversible if the perovskite is placed in nitrogen or vacuum quickly, before the water molecules form a 3-dimensional network of hydrogen-bonded molecules.119 After long exposures, however, grain boundaries become fully saturated and dehydrated MA4PbI6·2H2O forms, resulting in irreversible degradation of the perovskite.120 Müller et al. studied moisture ingress of perovskites and found that even at RH as low as 10%, one water molecule infiltrated every other unit cell and disrupted the hydrogen bonding of NH3+ and iodide as indicated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis of the N–H stretch (Fig. 4c and d).119 This infiltration by water was dependent on the microstructure of the film, and it was concluded that the primary ingress route was through defects and grain boundaries. This conclusion was supported by the observation that no similar moisture ingress was observed for single crystal perovskites in air. Below 10% RH, there was no detection of moisture ingress; however, the significant ingress that occurred once 10% RH was reached remained constant up to 50% RH (i.e., no change in the FTIR signal strength, Fig. 4d), suggesting that every readily accessible site is saturated with a water molecule at 10% RH. Exposure to low RH in air (i.e., with oxygen present) had a positive synergistic effect on the photocurrent, attributable to either improved conductivity from trap state filling or improved ionic conductivity of the material.119
While the observation that low levels of reversible moisture ingress improved photocurrent was promising, the experiment was not entirely realistic to a field deployment scenario because no light exposure was involved. When the perovskite is exposed to moisture concurrently with light exposure, the perovskite degradation is irreversible.116,121 In this case, interfacial and trap-assisted charge recombination initiate the irreversible degradation. Choi and coworkers determined that trapped charges (polarity insensitive) along the grain boundaries created local electric fields, which can neutralize the organic cations by deprotonation, making them less strongly bound to the PbI64− octahedra and allowing them to more readily volatilize.116,121
Even when encapsulated, perovskite-based devices can rapidly undergo moisture-induced degradation. In one example, Cheng and coworkers found moisture ingress degraded a glass-encapsulated MAPbI3 device to 20% of its initial PCE within 40 h when exposed to 85 °C and 80% RH.122 Degradation occurred in several layers of the device, including the conversion of MAPbI3 to PbI2, voids in the organic hole transport layer, and delamination and void formation in the Ag electrodes of the device. The authors postulated that the MAPbI3 evolved HI gas, which created the voids and corroded the Ag electrodes.122,123 This evolution of HI gas was not directly measured, though, and other possible degradation pathways exist. Qi and coworkers determined the thermal decomposition products of MAPbI3 by thermal gravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) coupled with quadrupole mass spectrometry (MS), and recorded the evolution of CH3I and NH3 rather than CH3NH2 and HI.124
2.4 Thermal degradation of perovskite
At operating conditions, photovoltaic devices can reach temperatures 45 °C higher than their surrounding environment.122 Thermal stability is thus a crucial parameter to consider in the design of perovskite solar cells. Under heating, MAPbI3 degrades to insulating PbI2 with deleterious effects to device performance.22,125–127 This thermal degradation can occur under continuous heating at temperatures as low as 80–85 °C, even in inert environments.125,127 Boyen and coworkers performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations and measured a low formation energy (0.11–0.14 eV), which was close to the estimated thermal energy at 85 °C, 0.093 eV.127 The similarity in formation energy and thermal energy suggested the perovskite structure would be unstable at this temperature. The authors tested this hypothesis by heating films at 85 °C for 24 h in N2, O2, or ambient conditions, and observed degradation of the perovskite into PbI2 in all cases, but with an environmental dependence. Under the ambient conditions, the rate of conversion to PbI2 was highest and the degraded product was measurable throughout the film. In the cases of N2 and O2 environments, the degradation was slowed significantly (with stability substantially higher in an environment of N2), but PbI2 was still present in large areas at the film surface. During heating, the methylamine decomposed into its nitrogen and carbon components. Furthermore, clusters of neutral lead formed, which behaved as charge traps and effectively reduced device performance.70,127,128 Methylamine decomposition into CH3I and NH3, and subsequent transformation of MAPbI3 to PbI2 were observed by in situ synchrotron analysis during heating (both at 20 min at 100 °C and >1 h at 80 °C).125 This degradation occurred predominantly at the surface of the perovskite, and was possibly related to a reorientation of the methylammonium cations from random orientations in pristine perovskite to an alignment orthogonal to the substrate when heated.129
2.5 Charge recombination at grain boundaries in perovskites
As discussed above, the surfaces of grain boundaries are critical to the performance and stability of perovskite films. In MAPbI3, grain boundaries have been observed to be the first areas to convert to PbI2 due to cation egress under thermal annealing.22 Charge traps in the film quench photogenerated carriers, resulting in larger series resistances and lower Voc and fill factors in devices.22 In pristine perovskite films, the surface potential of grains as measured by Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM) is several tens of millivolts higher at the boundaries than in the bulk.22,130 This elevated surface potential leads to downward bending of the LUMO and HOMO bands, resulting in a blocking of holes and increased collection of electrons at the grain boundaries.22,131 Similar elevated surface potentials at the grain boundaries have been observed as beneficial in CIGS, CZTS, and CZTSSe devices (∼150, 200, and 120 mV, respectively), acting as minority carrier collection channels.131 In perovskites, grain boundaries instead act as recombination sites due to the significantly faster local charge recombination than within grains.131–133
The extent of nonradiative recombination of charge carriers can be determined by the photoluminescence (PL) of a film.134–136 When compared to pristine perovskite films, an observed increase in the PL indicates sites for nonradiative recombination have been quenched, which should correspond with a higher device efficiency.137 Conversely, low PL suggests high levels of nonradiative recombination. Ginger and coworkers were able to develop spatially resolved maps of PL in perovskite films using confocal fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy.133 Strong PL quenching was observed at the grain boundaries, with a 65% decrease in PL at the grain boundaries compared to the bulk of the grains in MAPbI3(Cl) films (films prepared by methylammonium iodide and PbCl2 precursors). However, PL at these grain boundaries could be enhanced by passivation. For example, post-growth exposure to pyridine vapor was observed to be an effective strategy for passivation and resulted in an 11% increase in the PL brightness and 25% decrease in the wavelength width at the grain boundaries.133
Nonradiative recombination is deleterious to Voc and, in perovskite solar cells, is a consequence of localized surface charge traps.70 In addition to defects discussed above, these charge traps can be caused by Pb clusters on the perovskite surface, which over time can diffuse along the grain boundaries and grow to as large as 15 nm.70,128 The growth of these clusters initializes the volatilization of iodine and formation of holes at the grain boundaries.128 As the Pb clusters accumulate and iodine is released from the perovskite crystal, the formed holes can merge and result in the separation of grains, impeding intergranular charge transfer. Pb clustering can be initiated by many factors that volatilize iodine, and can be enhanced by morphological or stoichiometric inhomogeneities, high curvature of grains, or small grain size.128 This clustering cannibalizes the perovskite grains, but can be limited by the formation of PbI2, which forms a more stable interface with Pb clusters than does MAPbI3, or passivation, which allows enhanced interactions with the other perovskite constituents.70,128
3. Chemistry of additives
Defects at the surface of perovskite crystals are deleterious to device performance and stability. Grain boundaries in particular behave as crystallographic defects and the under-coordinated ions at their surfaces accumulate charge, increasing nonradiative recombination and reducing photovoltaic performance.89,135,138–140 Furthermore, these grain boundaries are chemically unstable sites, allowing egress of ions and ingress of moisture, resulting in service lifetimes on the order of only days or weeks, instead of the years afforded by other technologies such as silicon-based photovoltaics. Considering that the vast majority of perovskite films are polycrystalline, comprising small grains on the order of hundreds of nanometers and large networks of grain boundaries, the passivation of surface defects is highly relevant in perovskite devices. Passivation of grain boundaries by additives is a proven strategy to both reduce nonradiative recombination and to fill site vacancies, resulting in improved PCEs and chemical and thermomechanical stability of devices.141 In silicon devices, surface defects can be passivated by quenching with covalent bonds; however, this strategy is not an option in ionic materials such as perovskite.70 Instead, surface defects in perovskites are frequently quenched with additives that behave as Lewis acids or bases, with Lewis acids typically quenching Pb–I antisite defects (i.e., PbI3−) or under-coordinated halide sites, and Lewis bases quenching under-coordinated Pb2+ sites.
Additives can also play a role in the formation of perovskite when added directly into the precursor solution. Organic additives are particularly useful because of their wide range of structures that allow incorporation of a multitude of chemical functionalities. These additives typically interact with the perovskite precursors through Lewis acid–base interactions, forming dative coordination bonds that affect the crystallization kinetics, although hydrogen bonding can also occur. Both types of interactions reduce the free energy of nucleation—accelerating the rate of nucleation—and retard crystal growth, facilitating the formation of uniform perovskite films with less defects.72,86–88
In this section, we will summarize the properties and functions of additives typically used in 3D, quasi-2D, and 2D perovskite materials, and their chemical interactions with perovskite and its constituents. Our aim is to provide inspiration and reference for the selection and design of organic additives for perovskite semiconductors in the future.
3.1 Small molecule additives for 3D perovskites

3.1.1 Lewis acid–base interactions in perovskite. 
Initially, the stability of perovskite precursors in solution was thought to be related to the dielectric constant of the solvent, with dielectric constants above 30 necessary to form stable perovskite solutions.142–144 The dielectric constants of pure solvents can be defined by their intermolecular interactions using the Kirkwood model.145 This model can be extended for mixed solvents, which are technologically relevant for many perovskite compositions, showing that the dielectric constant is modified based on the polarizability, mole fraction, and molar volume of each of the solvent components.146 Critically, when considering solvent/anti-solvent mixtures, the inclusion of anti-solvents decreases the dielectric constant of the solvents, leading to rapid perovskite formation.
Clancy and coworkers modeled the solvent/anti-solvent interactions for multiple solvent mixtures with MAPbI3 precursors by assuming a 2:1 ratio of DMF (dielectric constant, ε = 36.7) to the anti-solvents dichloromethane (ε = 8.98), chlorobenzene (ε = 5.62), anisole (ε = 4.33), and toluene (ε = 2.38). The mixtures of DMF and anti-solvent all resulted in decreased ε relative to DMF, with the addition of dichloromethane, chlorobenzene, anisole, and toluene resulting in dielectric constants of 28.54, 24.38, 23.73, and 22.66, respectively.147 All of these values were below 30, consistent with unstable perovskite solutions, consistent with the rapid perovskite formation when anti-solvents are added. Interestingly, DMF had a higher calculated affinity to all anti-solvents than to itself and the binding energies of MA+ to PbI3−/anti-solvent complexes were all more negative (i.e., more favorable) than to PbI3−/DMF complexes, indicating that the anti-solvents readily replace and remove the DMF from the perovskite. Mayer bond order also indicated that these stronger interactions were also fundamentally different in nature. While DMF formed dative bonds with perovskite precursors, none of the anti-solvents did; rather, the anti-solvents chlorobenzene, anisole, and toluene—which all have conjugated rings—interacted with the lead atoms via π interactions delocalized throughout the conjugated rings.
While dielectric constants are potentially promising starting points for selecting perovskite solvents, several solvents with high dielectric constants—e.g., ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate, acetonitrile, and nitromethane—do not form stable perovskite precursor solutions, indicating that the dielectric constant of the solvent is not the sole predictor of the solubility of perovskite precursors.144 Loo and coworkers found that the solubility of perovskite precursors is instead dominated by Lewis acid–base interactions.144 Lewis bases are an electron-pair donor, which satisfy the Lewis acid, an electron-pair acceptor.148 In lead-based perovskite precursor solutions, Pb2+ behaves as a Lewis acid, with a d orbital that can accept lone pair electrons donated by Lewis bases.149 In formed perovskite films, antisite defects such as PbI3− act as Lewis bases.92 Thus, the addition of Lewis acids and/or bases into perovskite precursor solutions is a widely used approach to improve perovskite device performance.135,138,141,149–156
The coordination ability of different solvents can be characterized by their Gutmann's donor number, DN, which is a description of Lewis basicity and measures the enthalpy of formation of a 1:1 adduct of the solvent with SbCl5 in 1,2-dichloroethane.144,157 The strength of the interactions of the solvent with Pb2+ during crystal growth is correlated with DN, meaning a higher DN indicates stronger interactions with Pb2+ and better solubility of the precursors. Loo and coworkers reported that solvents with a DN greater than 18.0 kcal mol−1 form stable solutions of MAI and PbI2 at a concentration of 1 M. Below 18.0 kcal mol−1, the perovskite precipitates out as single crystals (Fig. 5a). Calculation of the formation constant, Kf, for the iodation of PbI3− to PbI42−—a transition step to forming PbI64− octahedra of perovskite—was performed by Benesi–Hildebrand analysis to assess the relative strength of interactions between the solvent and perovskite precursors.144,158 For propylene carbonate, a solvent with a low DN of 15.1 kcal mol−1, Kf was measured to be 94 ± 2 M−1, indicating that PbI42− (and by similar logic, PbI64−) formed at a rapid rate.144 Conversely, when the same analysis was repeated with the perovskite precursors in dimethylformamide, a solvent with a higher DN 26.6 kcal mol−1, Kf was measured to be an order of magnitude lower at 9.8 ± 0.3 M−1, indicating that the solvent interacted strongly with the Pb2+ of the perovskite precursors and inhibited crystal formation in solution.

(a) For perovskite solution stability in various organic solvents, the dielectric constant (red triangles) is not as predictive as the donor number, DN (blue circles).

As with dielectric constants, the DN of mixed solvents will be different than either of the pure solvents. In the case where the solvents have similar DN (e.g., DMF and dimethylsulfoxide), the mixture behavior is ideal; that is, the DN is approximately a weighted average based on the relative mole fractions of each solvent.159 When solvents with large differences in DN are mixed, the DN quickly increases with increasing concentration of the higher DN solvent before increasing more slowly as the mixture approaches a 1:1 mole fraction. Wei and coworkers studied binary solvents of DMF (DN = 26.6 kcal mol−1) mixed with N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP, DN = 27.3 kcal mol−1), DMSO (DN = 29.8 kcal mol−1), and hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA, DN = 38.8 kcal mol−1) in a small-scale two-step process.160 While the authors did not report the DN of the mixed solvents, they found that the thermal stability of the resulting perovskite films improved when higher DN co-solvents were added, attributed to stronger interactions.
Another consideration when mixing solvents is their relative volatility. For example, Huang and coworkers used a combination of two volatile and low DN solvents, acetonitrile and 2-methoxyethanol, with a small amount of the less volatile and higher DN DMSO to develop a fast blade-coating process.161 The more volatile solvents evaporated forming a continuous film with small grains, while the less volatile and more strongly coordinating DMSO remained in the film and drove larger perovskite grain growth.
A general way of thinking about Pb2+ is that it is a borderline soft Lewis acid and should therefore form more stable complexes with bases that have higher polarizability or lower electronegativity.162 Stated more simply, according to hard and soft acid and base theory, soft acids bind better with soft bases and hard acids bind better with hard bases.162–164 Loo and coworkers thus followed up their previous study which focused on O-donor Lewis bases, by studying softer S-donor Lewis bases, which should be better additives for Pb-based perovskite solutions.157 Importantly, the authors verified that Pb2+ exhibits a coordination number of six in solution, due to its octahedral geometry, with five of these coordination sites occupied by I−, and the last occupied by the Lewis base solvent. By mixing N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and its sulfur containing analogue, N,N-dimethylthioformamide (DTMF), the authors were able to determine whether the O-donor or S-donor more preferentially interacted with Pb2+. The process was repeated with N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone thione (NMPT) to confirm the effect was based on the donor type. By calculating the relative coordination numbers for the solvents, the authors found that the S-donors outcompeted the O-donors to interact with the Pb2+ in the last coordination site unoccupied by I− (Fig. 5b and c). Density functional theory calculations of the binding enthalpy of a variety of O- and S-donor analogues with Pb2+ confirmed that the preferential interaction with S-donors compared to O-donors is universal in perovskites, with a 40-fold increase in equilibrium constant of S-donors binding to Pb2+.


3.1.2 Common small molecules as Lewis base additives. 
Lewis base additives have been demonstrated to control the morphology and crystal growth of perovskites by forming metastable coordination compound intermediates with the Pb2+, resulting in better film formation.152 Typical Lewis bases reported in the literature include N,N-dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO),72,165N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP),153 urea,166,167 thiourea,85,149,151,155,168,169 thiophene,135,154,170 and pyridine135,150 and its derivatives.171,172 The chemical structures of selected Lewis base additives are shown in Fig. 6, organized by the moiety that primarily interacts with the perovskite. Table 1 highlights how common Lewis base additives affect the efficiency and stability of varying perovskites.

DMSO is a Lewis base that interacts with surface Pb2+ in perovskite through its electron pairs on the oxygen atom, making it a prototypical O-donor additive. In a study by Park and coworkers, the introduction of DMSO in a 1:1:1 molar ratio with precursors PbI2 and MAI in DMF (i.e., PbI2:MAI:DMSO) was observed to improve film formation, leading to solar cells with PCEs of 19.7%.72 The authors attributed the improved film quality to the formation of a 1:1:1 adduct of MAI·PbI2·DMSO. This adduct was confirmed by a shift in the FTIR spectra of the stretching vibration of SO from 1045 to 1015 cm−1, indicative of a decreasing bond strength between the sulfur and oxygen atom as a result of the formation of the adduct (Fig. 7a).72,165 The DMSO in the adduct phase contributed to the improved solubility of PbI2 and retarded the rapid reaction between PbI2 and MAI during the evaporation of solvent in the spin-coating process. This approach was later extended to formamidinium lead iodide perovskite (FAPbI3).85 In this case, DMSO was found to be ineffective, which the authors attributed to the relative dissimilarity between DMSO and formamidinium iodide (FAI). While DMSO and MAI share the commonality of terminal methyl groups, FAI instead terminates with primary amines. When instead using the more structurally similar thiourea, which also has two primary amines, film quality was observed to improve. Furthermore, the sulfur donor group of thiourea is stronger than the oxygen donor group of DMSO, resulting in improved interactions with both PbI2 and FAI.149 The formation of FAI·PbI2·thiourea adducts was observed by a red shift of the SC stretching vibration from 730 to 714 cm−1 in FTIR. Conversely, with the addition of DMSO to PbI2 and FAI, there was only a slight shift in the SO vibration, indicating that the interaction between FAI and DMSO was very weak. The FAPbI3 films formed via the FAI·PbI2·thiourea adduct showed a larger crystallite size, leading to faster charge transport, reduced trap states, and ultimately a higher PCE.

Another O-donor Lewis base, NMP was found to form a more stable intermediate adduct with FAI and PbI2 than DMSO, resulting in uniform and pinhole-free FAPbI3 films and devices with a higher PCE (Fig. 7b and c).153 The improved efficiency with NMP added was attributed to FAI interacting more strongly with NMP than DMSO, as evidenced by the larger red shift of the CO stretching vibration in FAI·PbI2·NMP (from 1654 to 1640 cm−1) than the SO stretching vibration in FAI·PbI2·DMSO (no obvious shift) in FTIR. Interaction energies of the intermediate adducts FAI·PbI2·NMP (−2.413 eV) and FAI·PbI2·DMSO (−2.138 eV) calculated by DFT provided further evidence of the strong FAI–NMP interaction. In this study, Yang and coworkers also compared O-donor Lewis bases with different molecular structures—NMP and DMSO, as well as dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone (DMI), tetramethylurea (TMU), and N-methylformamide (NMF) (Fig. 7d)—and proposed three additive selection rules.153 The first selection rule was that the additives must be excellent hydrogen bonding acceptors, but poor hydrogen bonding donors. By this definition, NMP, with its high hydrogen bond accepting ability (β = 77) and low Lewis acidity (acceptor number, AN = 13.3), was preferred over DMSO (β = 76 and AN = 19.3). NMF is also an excellent hydrogen bond acceptor (β = 80), but its high acidity (AN = 32.1) prevented the formation of a stable adduct film. The second selection rule was that the electron donating atom of the additive needs to be sterically accessible. The effects of steric accessibility were demonstrated by comparing DMI to TMU, two additives which have a similar molecular structure, β, and acceptor numbers. DMI differs from TMU in that two methyl groups are covalently bonded to form a 5-membered ring, while in TMU, the methyl groups can rotate freely and thus inhibit accessibility to the O-donor. The readily accessible O-donor of DMI resulted in the formation of stable adduct films, while no stable adduct films were formed with the addition of TMU. The third selection rule was that the hardness/softness of the Lewis acids and bases must be similar. As discussed above, hard acids bond more strongly with hard bases and soft acids bond more strongly with soft bases. This rule was demonstrated by comparing affinities of MA+ and FA+ to DMSO and NMP. MA+ is a harder base than FA+ with a larger dipole moment (2.29 D versus 0.21 D);123 likewise DMSO has a lower polarizability than NMP (8.03 Å3versus 10.66 Å3), making it a harder base.173 These values suggested that adducts of MAI were more stable with DMSO and FAI were more stable with NMP. DFT calculations were consistent with this trend, with MAI·PbI2·DMSO having a higher interaction energy (−1.619 eV) than MAI·PbI2·NMP (−1.541 eV) and FAI·PbI2·NMP (−2.413 eV) having a higher interaction energy than FAI·PbI2·DMSO (−2.138 eV).153
Other O-donors incorporating carbonyl groups, such as the environmentally friendly urea have been used as co-additives with DMSO to prepare MAPbI3 perovskites.166 Films fabricated by a one-step spin coating process with anti-solvent treatment formed a MAI·PbI2·DMSO·urea adduct during the process, as evidenced by an FTIR measured red shift of CO stretching vibration of urea from 1676 to 1651 cm−1. This shift was attributed to the high dipole moment of urea (4.56 D) compared to DMSO (3.96 D), which resulted in stronger interactions with the perovskite precursors than just adding DMSO alone. Larger grains were observed in the films with the urea additive, with grain size over 1 μm with 4 mol% of urea added, indicating a higher critical Gibbs free energy for nucleation that reduced the number of nuclei and retarded the crystal growth (Fig. 8a). The high boiling point of the urea resulted in some remaining at the grain boundaries of the film, passivating defects and enhancing the charge transport. Compared to pristine MAPbI3 perovskites, those with urea incorporated were found to exhibit longer carrier lifetimes (752.4 versus 200.5 ns) and higher steady-state PCEs (18.25 versus 16.80%). Similarly high efficiencies (17.82%) were reported by Wang and coworkers after fabricating large grain-size MAPbI3 film with DMSO and urea.167 Urea has also been shown to be an effective additive in two-step synthesis processes where PbI2 films are immersed into MAI baths.174 In this case, upon immersion into a MAI/urea bath, a MAI·PbI2·urea adduct was formed that inhibited the reaction between PbI2 and MAI. This inhibited reaction slowed the crystallization kinetics and ensured that MAI fully penetrated into the PbI2 film, leading to a more uniform MAPbI3 film with larger grain size. Grain size was found to be proportional to the concentration of urea; however, excess urea at higher concentrations accumulated at the grain boundaries and hampered charge transport. The optimal urea concentration in this report was found to be 0.4 mg mL−1, and devices with urea exhibited a much higher PCE (13.10%) than devices without urea (10.21%).

Dai and coworkers recently employed biuret, a Lewis base additive with a similar molecular structure to urea, which passivated interfacial ionic defects and crosslinked adjacent grains (Fig. 8b and c). The molecular structure of biuret includes two carbonyl groups rather than one like urea, and these groups strongly coordinated with PbI2 to slow down the crystallization process of MAPbI3 to increase grain size (Fig. 8d and e).175 The addition of low concentrations of biuret (i.e., 2 mol%) increased device efficiency from 18.26 to 21.16% and enhanced the stability of unencapsulated devices exposed to ambient air (20–25 °C and 30–40% RH) in the dark (Fig. 8f and g). These ambient-exposed devices retained 93% of their initial PCE over 1000 h, compared to only 81% PCE retention for the control device.
Thiourea, which replaces the oxygen atom in urea with a sulfur atom, is a common S-donor additive reported to interact more strongly with Pb2+ than O-donors, leading to more stable Lewis acid–base intermediates.149,151,169 Adding thiourea to quadruple-cation-based perovskites—Rb0.05{Cs0.05[(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15]0.95}0.95 (CsRbFAMA)—resulted in an increased PCE (from 19.61% to 20.92%) and grain size (from 1.7 μm to 2.6 μm) when compared to pristine CsRbFAMA.169 Similar results were observed with triple-cation perovskites in this same study. The increased grain sizes were due to the synergistic effects of an increased Gibbs free energy of nucleation upon the addition of thiourea and the strong coordination of thiourea and the precursors which retarded the crystallization kinetics. However, removal of the thiourea during the annealing process is more difficult than removing urea due to its relatively higher volatilization temperature.151 Thiourea that remained on the surface and in grain boundaries of the perovskite film had deleterious effects on device performance. Instead of passivating the surface, residual thiourea was found to increase trap density and trigger charge recombination, reducing PCE.151 Cao and coworkers found that the residual thiourea could be extracted from the film through a two-step sequential ethyl acetate treatment (Fig. 9a).168 The strong interactions within the MAI·PbI2·thiourea adduct slowed crystallization and increased the perovskite grain sizes to >1 μm (Fig. 9b–d). Following the ethyl acetate post-processing to remove the thiourea, the film became smoother with fewer defects, enhancing the light harvesting and accelerating charge separation and transport. Accordingly, MAPbI3 solar cells fabricated with thiourea and rinsed with ethyl acetate exhibited an elevated PCE of 18.46% compared to just 13.38% without the rinse. Zhu et al. studied the effects of volatilization temperature on crystal growth and device performance, using thiourea, along with urea and DMSO—additives with increasing boiling points—in the mixed perovskite (FAPbI3)0.75(MAPbI3)0.17(MAPbBr3)0.08.151 A correlation between the grain size and volatilization temperature was found, with films incorporating thiourea exhibiting grains ∼5 μm after 40 min of annealing at 100 °C, compared to only 200–500 nm for films incorporating DMSO. These grain sizes were attributed to a ripening effect, with the less volatile thiourea forming coordination complexes with the perovskite for a greater length of time than the more volatile DMSO. Despite the thiourea additive increasing perovskite grain size an order of magnitude more than the DMSO additive, PSCs fabricated with thiourea additives performed significantly poorer than those fabricated with DMSO additives (3.93% compared to 18.84%). This poor performance for thiourea-based devices was again attributed to increased trap density and nonradiative recombination due to a small amount of residual thiourea that could not be removed from the films during annealing; however, when DMSO and urea were used together in a 4:1 molar ratio, the PCE was increased to 20.06%, likely due to improved grain ripening, but without the deleterious effects of excess residual urea. Conversely, Yang and coworkers found that thiourea did not need to be removed to improve device efficiency, measuring a PCE of 19.57% compared to 18.08% for a control device, although it is unclear why these devices performed better than those from other groups.176 It is possible that the quantity of residual thiourea was much lower in this study. In the work by Yang, it was observed that thiourea-containing devices had much better shelf stability than those without, with 0.1 and 1.0 cm2 thiourea-passivated devices exhibiting 98% and 93% initial PCE retention, respectively, after 2 months in ambient air, while thiourea-free devices exhibited only 63% and 50% PCE retention for the same size devices. These improvements were attributed to the strong interactions of S with Pb, which has a stronger binding energy (−0.78 eV) than O with Pb (−0.53 eV). These high binding energies allow the S atoms of thiourea to substitute into iodine vacancies and prevent oxygen corrosion, inhibiting the formation of superoxide species. Cui et al. avoided the potential issue of residual thiourea altogether by instead introducing thioacetamide (TAA), a volatile S-donor Lewis base, into the perovskite film post annealing.177 The TAA also formed an S-donor adduct (MAI·PbI2·DMSO·TAA), but was completely volatilized during the annealing process. Adding just 1.0% TAA into MAPbI3 increased the average grain size from 249 to 960 nm and increased the PCE from 17.01% to 18.9%.

Snaith and coworkers studied the use of cyclic additives such as pyridine (N-donor) and thiophene (S-donor) to passivate under-coordinated Pb2+ at the surface and grain boundaries of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskites (Fig. 9e).135 Pyridine was more effective than thiophene at passivating the surfaces, attributed to stronger binding between the pyridine and perovskite.135 Pyridine-treated perovskite had higher PLQE (photoluminescence quantum efficiency) at lower fluence, although the thiophene-treated perovskite exhibited carrier lifetimes around 10% higher, possibly due to the pyridine negatively affecting radiative recombination. Trap states were reduced by 3-fold in thiophene-treated perovskite (1.0 × 1016 cm−3), and over an order of magnitude in pyridine-treated perovskite (0.2 × 1016 cm−3) when compared to an untreated control (3.5 × 1016 cm−3).135 These factors resulted in higher PCEs for thiophene treated (15.3%) and pyridine treated (16.5%) solar cells when compared to the control devices (13%). Pyridine has also facilitated the room-temperature fabrication of high-quality MAPbI3 films.178 Choy and coworkers used a two-step process, first forming a PbI2·(pyridine)2 complex by immersing PbI2 film in a pyridine vapor, followed by submersion in a MAI solution to exchange the pyridine for methylammonium.178 The PbI2·(pyridine)2 complex formed a film in the first step that had a nanoporous structure (Fig. 9f and g), which readily allowed diffusion of MAI into the structure for an exchange reaction with the pyridine, resulting in a smooth and uniform MAPbI3 film (Fig. 9h and i). This two-step process was found to enable more favorable kinetics for perovskite formation; DFT calculations showed that in a one-step perovskite fabrication process, there is a high activation energy barrier of 1.004 eV, while in the pyridine-promoted pathway, the activation energies of the two stages were reduced to 0.095 and 0.741 eV, respectively (Fig. 9j). Room-temperature fabricated MAPbI3 devices using pyridine had a PCE of 17.10% with 95% retention after 1000 h of storage in ambient conditions. Adding pyridine directly into the precursors for FA0.88Cs0.12PbI3 perovskite was found to be unbeneficial, although multidentate pyridines were found to improve the film quality and device performance.172 Bidentate 2,2′-bipyridine (Bpy) and tridentate 2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine (Tpy) used as additives for the fabrication of FA0.88Cs0.12PbI3 films increased PCE from 16.85 ± 0.44% for the pristine to 18.61 ± 0.27% when Bpy and 18.21 ± 0.29% when Tpy were included. This improved performance was attributed to Bpy and Tpy passivating the iodide vacancies and retarding perovskite crystallization, although it should be noted that hysteresis was not improved with these additives, suggesting that ion migration was still occurring.


3.1.3 Alkylamines. 
Amines and ammonium salt additives also interact strongly with Pb2+, and as such, they also fall under the category of Lewis bases. These salt additives are so prevalent that a separate, deeper discussion on their use is warranted. A variety of these additives have been reported on, including methylamine (MA),135,179,180n-butylamine (BA),179,181 hexylamine (HA),179 octylamine (OA),179 aniline,156 benzylamine,156 phenethylamine,156 ethane-1,2-diammonium (EDA),182,183 propane-1,3-diammonium (PDA),138,182 hexane-1,6-diammonium (HDA),138,182 octane-1,8-diammonium (ODA),138,182 glycine (Gly),184 leucine (Leu),185,186 alanine (Ala),184,185,187 γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA),188 5-aminovaleric acid (5-AVA),1,184,185,189–191 6-aminocaproic acid (6-ACA),189 7-aminoheptanoic acid (7-AHA),189p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA),192 and phenylalanine (Phe).186 We will discuss amino acids in Section 3.1.5; this section will focus on the alkylamine additives shown in Table 2.

Unilateral alkylamine additives (UAAs), which have a R–NH2 molecular structure, bilateral alkylamine additives (BAAs), which have a H2N–R–NH2 molecular structure, and amino acids, which have a H2N–R–COOH molecular structure, are the most reported amine additives in perovskites (Fig. 10). The amine groups of UAAs typically interact directly with the ions or A-site vacancies at the interface of the perovskite crystals, while the alkyl group points away from the crystal. These alkyl groups are hydrophobic and have the added benefit of improved moisture resistance; however, the alkyl groups are electronically insulating and must be kept relatively short so as not to disrupt charge transport. Recently, Wu and coworkers systematically investigated the roles alkyl-chain lengths played in the defect passivation efficacy of UAAs.179 A trace amount (i.e., 0.025 wt%) of methylamine, butylamine, hexylamine, or octylamine—that is, the amines attached to alkyl chains with one, four, six, or eight carbons, respectively—was introduced into perovskite precursor ink to synthesize UAA-modified Cs0.05FA0.70MA0.25PbI3 perovskite films. In all cases, the incorporation of the UAAs led to compact and smooth perovskite layers with relatively small grain sizes compared with the pristine perovskite. The UAAs reduced grain sizes by acting as surface ligands to the colloidal perovskite nuclei, suppressing the perovskite crystal growth. This effect was inversely dependent on the UAA length—as the length of the alkyl chains increased, the reduction of grain sizes was more pronounced. Surprisingly, despite the reduction in grain size and increase in insulating content, the PCEs of the devices monotonically increased with alkyl length. While the maximum PCE for a UAA-free device was 18.4%, the maximum PCEs for the UAA-incorporating devices ranged from 19.1 to 21.5%, with the highest achieved by adding octylamine (Fig. 11a). Increases in the Jsc, Voc, and FF were observed to correlate with chain length, as well. The authors hypothesized that this effect was due to defect passivation efficacy and measured the trap density of states (tDOS) to test this hypothesis (Fig. 11b). Two trap regions were observed in the pristine (additive-free) films, a deeper region (0.40–0.55 eV) ascribed to defects on the film surface and a shallower region (0.30–0.40 eV) ascribed to traps at grain boundaries.92 Methylamine and butylamine additives resulted in some passivation of the shallower trap states, but minimal passivation of the deeper surface trap states, while hexylamine and octylamine both significantly passivated trap states in all regions. It was concluded that short-chain amines (<6 carbons) preferred to surround the grain boundaries to passivate grain boundaries, while long-chain amines (≥6 carbons) passivated the grain boundaries and the film surface (Fig. 11c). Increasing length of the chains in linear UAAs was found to also be beneficial in perovskite LEDs based on perovskite crystals, with a correlation between carbon content and photoluminescence quantum yield and stability to washing by ethyl acetate.193

In addition to UAAs, other monoamines have been implemented to passivate perovskites while adding additional functionalities. For example, amine-based derivatives of benzene—aniline, benzylamine, and phenethylamine156—have been implemented as passivating agents due to their hydrophobicity and conjugated structure which is more favorable for charge transport than insulating alkyl groups.156 Adding these amine-based derivatives of benzene to FAPbI3 devices resulted in drastically improved device stability. When exposed to air at 50 ± 5% relative humidity, devices with benzylamine additives maintained their efficiency for more than 2900 h, while pristine devices without additives completely failed after 90 h.156 Devices with aniline and phenethylamine also exhibited better stability than pristine FAPbI3, but were much less stable than devices incorporating benzylamine.156 DFT calculations indicated that the stability was likely due to the efficiency of the additive molecular packing at the perovskite surface.156 The benzylamines packed in a highly efficient arrangement perpendicular to the perovskite surface, while the packing of aniline and phenethylamine was more irregular and readily allowed water to interact with the perovskite surface.156
Bilateral alkylamine additives, molecules with alkyl groups and two terminal amines, are passivation agents that can bond with two under-coordinated Pb2+ sites simultaneously.138 Small concentrations (0.025 wt%) of BAAs have been included in perovskite inks and demonstrated in scalable blade-coating fabrication of efficient and stable perovskite solar cells.138 Three BAAs, 1,3-diaminopropane (DAP), 1,6-diaminohexane (DAH), and 1,8-diaminooctane (DAO) were selected for incorporation into MAPbI3-BAA devices. All devices incorporating BAAs showed significant improvements in PCE over pristine MAPbI3 (18.3%), with MAPbI3-DAP performing better than (21.7%) the DAH- and DAO-based devices (20.8% and 20.3%, respectively). The enhanced PCE with the addition of the BAAs was attributed to the effective passivation of under-coordinated Pb2+ ions by forming coordination bonds with the amine tails of BAA (Fig. 12a). Interestingly, contrary to what has been observed in perovskites incorporating UAAs, an inverse relationship was found between PCE and the length of the additive alkyl groups. This decreasing performance was attributed to impaired charge transport due to the insulating effect of carbon. That this effect was not observed with UAAs necessitates further exploration. A key benefit of BAAs compared to UAAs and other monoamines is that they can act like glue between grains, reinforcing the grain boundaries and making the perovskite films more resistant to mechanical bending (Fig. 12b–d).138 Inclusion of DAP effectively passivated trap states, with a broadband decrease of the trap density of states of MAPbI3-DAP compared to pristine MAPbI3 (Fig. 12e). Finally, the BAAs allowed for dual anchoring to the top of the perovskite surface, exposing the hydrophobic carbon chain and forming a moisture-repelling barrier, which enhanced the perovskite stability. MAPbI3-DAP and pristine MAPbI3 devices were exposed to different conditions to determine how quickly their performance degraded. When stored in ambient conditions, unencapsulated MAPbI3-DAP devices retained 90% of their initial PCE for 1000 h, while pristine MAPbI3 devices exhibited a 50% decrease of their initial PCE after 500 h. Similarly, encapsulated MAPbI3-DAP devices under continuous 1 sun illumination retained 90% of their initial PCE for 500 h, while pristine MAPbI3 devices retained only 35% of their initial PCE after 200 h (Fig. 12f and g).

3.1.4 Ammonium salts. 
While the approach of adding either Lewis acids or bases to the perovskite addresses specific surface defects (e.g., antisite or under-coordinated Pb2+ defects), an ideal additive is one that could passivate all surface defects in the perovskite. Huang and coworkers showed that by adding quaternary ammonium halides which comprise separate positive and negative ions, both negatively and positively charged surface defects could be passivated simultaneously.70 This strategy was generalizable to multiple types of perovskite and resulted in a reduction of the tDOS to just one third that of perovskite passivated with a fullerene that only quenched Pb–I antisite defects.70
Diammonium additives, structurally similar to BAAs, but with ionized ammonium groups instead of amines, have also been demonstrated to effectively passivate defects. In 2017, Spiccia and coworkers studied ethane-1,2-diammonium (EDA2+) as an additive in MAPbI3 precursor solutions to prepare mixed-cation perovskite films by a one-step spin-coating process.182 Interestingly, EDA2+ incorporated within the 3D MAPbI3 perovskite lattice structure, rather than at the surfaces, resulting in a perovskite with a molecular formula of MA1−2xEDAxPbI3. The concentration was varied, and the best performing PSCs were found to be those with 0.8% EDA2+ (PCE = 18.6%). These devices retained 75% of their initial PCE after 72 h at 50% RH and 50 °C under 1 sun illumination, whereas pristine MAPbI3 devices degraded by approximately 90% within only 15 h. The authors proposed that EDA2+ acted as a crosslink between the perovskite units by forming hydrogen bonds with PbI64−, resulting in a stabilized structure. They further speculated that this structure could suppress the diffusion of MA+ or I− known to be deleterious to perovskite device performance and stability.89–92,94,194


3.1.5 Amino acids. 
Amino acids—molecules with both amino and carboxyl moieties—are perhaps the most commonly studied additives for perovskite films because of their strong Lewis acid–base interactions and ability to bond (or “crosslink”) neighboring grains together through hydrogen bonding interactions.1,184–192,195 Amino acid additives that have been successfully incorporated in perovskites are shown in Table 3. In 2014, 5-aminovaleric acid iodide (5-AVAI) was first added to perovskite precursor solutions and partially replaced MA+, forming a mixed-cation perovskite (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3.1 Devices were fabricated by drop-casting the precursor solution through a triple layered porous film comprising a carbon electrode, a ZrO2 electron blocking layer, and a TiO2 electron transport layer atop a fluorine-doped tin oxide electrode.1 The (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3 infiltrated the porous triple layer and coated the substrate completely; conversely, pure MAPbI3 coated the substrate poorly and left large areas of the device without perovskite. This difference in surface coverage was attributed to the 5-AVA templating the perovskite crystal nucleation and growth. The carboxyl groups of 5-AVA anchored to the surface of the oxide layers, while the amino groups nucleated perovskite crystal growth throughout the porous layers. The (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3 grew preferentially along the c-axis, directed by hydrogen bonding of the carboxyls and aminos to the halides of the perovskite. This improved crystallization of the AVA-based perovskite compared to pure MAPbI3 resulted in a nearly three-fold increase in charge carrier lifetime (23.7 ns versus 8.14 ns) and significantly improved PCE (11.6% versus 7.2%). Furthermore, unencapsulated AVA-based devices showed excellent efficiency stability for 1008 hours of exposure to ambient air under full sunlight. It should be noted that while these devices were technically unencapsulated, the carbon electrode acted as a water-blocking layer.

5-AVAI has also been shown to stabilize α-FAPbI3 at room temperature.190 Typically, the photoactive α-FAPbI3 is thermodynamically unstable at room temperature and readily converts to the yellow δ-FAPbI3.190,196 Grätzel and coworkers reported a simple one-step deposition method to prepared a stable and high quality α-phase FAPbI3 which they called FAPbI3(AVAI)0.25.190 This perovskite was highly crystalline with micrometer-sized and resulted in solar cells with much higher PCEs (18.94%) than those with pristine FAPbI3 (7.26%). The hydrogen bonding of the 5-AVA with the perovskite acted to crosslink neighboring grains, stabilizing the α-FAPbI3 perovskite and inhibiting the α-to-δ phase transition. As a result, the optimized α-FAPbI3(AVAI)0.25 retained 90% of the initial efficiency after 300 h under continuous illumination.
Other amino acids with similar molecular structures to 5-AVAI, but less carbon content have also had beneficial effects for perovskites. Aminopropanoic acid (an amino acid with only 3 aliphatic carbons), enhanced MAPbI3 device efficiency by 15% (from 17.51 to 19.23%) with the addition of only 0.56 wt%.187 However, a significant drop-off in PCE (12.71%) occurred when the concentration was doubled to 1.12 wt%. This reduced efficiency was particularly surprising as these films exhibited greater PL intensities and lifetimes than all other films, in addition to carrier mobilities similar to that of pristine perovskite, suggesting that the insulating effects of the small molecule were not deteriorating device performance.187 γ-Aminobutyric acid iodide (GABAI)—the amino acid iodide with one less aliphatic carbon than 5-AVAI—was used to improve MAPbI3 device performance monotonically up to a concentration of 10 mol%.188 Like 5-AVAI, GABAI eliminated pinholes and increased grain size to over a micron at 10 mol%. At this optimized concentration of GABAI, devices exhibited increased efficiencies compared to pristine MAPbI3 (18.31% versus 15.08%), and after 30 days of exposure to 45% RH at room temperature, the GABAI devices retained 72% of their initial PCE while pristine devices only exhibited 5% retention.188 Both improvements were attributed to higher film quality and the strong intermolecular interactions between the carboxyl group of GABAI and the PbI6 octahedra.
The molecular rigidity of amino acid additives can also play a role in device performance by driving growth along preferred orientations. Comparing the relatively flexible GABAI to p-aminobenzoic acid iodide (PABAI), a rigid amino acid containing a benzene ring between the amino and carboxylic acid groups, PABAI was found to enhance the PCE of MAPbI3 devices (17.35% versus 15.28%) (Fig. 13a).192 The grain sizes of perovskite with GABAI and PABAI additives were similar, but perovskite with added PABAI exhibited a preferred orientation of (110) (Fig. 13b). This enhanced alignment was due to stronger interactions of the PABAI with the Pb–I framework; the rigid benzene ring of PABAI enhanced ordering of the additives through π–π stacking, helping to keep the grain “crosslinking” amino and carboxylic acid groups in the same axis. Conversely, the less rigid GABAI had more degrees of freedom that allowed the amino and carboxylic acid groups to deviate from uniaxial alignment, which resulted in adjacent perovskite crystals adopting a relatively more random orientation (Fig. 13c).192

A budding area of relevance going forward is the inclusion of amino acids in lead-free Sn-based perovskites, which exhibit similar or even better optoelectronic properties to Pb-based perovskites, yet poorer stability.24,190,191,197 The inclusion of additives is a necessity to address the stability issues limiting the viability of these materials, namely that Sn2+ is easily oxidized to Sn4+.198–200 Islam and coworkers introduced 5-AVAI as a co-additive with SnF2—an additive used to reduce the concentration of Sn4+ in Sn-based perovskite—to form FASnI3 films.191 The films prepared with 5-AVAI as a co-additive exhibited a reduction in pinholes and Sn4+ content compared to films prepared with only SnF2 as an additive.191 The addition of 5-AVAI suppressed the charge recombination in the FASnI3 film and enhanced the charge carrier lifetime, resulting in an increasing PCE of FASnI3-based perovskite solar cells from 3.4% to 7.0%. Moreover, the 5-AVAI enhanced the perovskite air stability, with solar cells maintaining their initial performance for 100 h under 50% RH and continuous illumination, whereas devices with only SnF2 added decayed continuously and maintained only 75% of its initial efficiency under the same conditions.


3.1.6 Conjugated small molecules. 
Recently, semiconducting (i.e., conjugated) small molecules have been used as perovskite additives to improve charge transport in addition to surface passivation.141,201,202 Conjugated molecules have a wide range of structures, all of which comprise alternating single and double bonds representing delocalized π electrons that give the molecules semiconducting properties. These molecules thus add functionality to the perovskite by potentially acting as charge carriers, rather than insulating charge barriers at the perovskite surfaces and grain boundaries. Examples of conjugated molecules used as additives for perovskite are listed in Table 4.

One commonly reported on molecule in the literature is the fullerene phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), a Lewis acid additive that fully diffuses into the perovskite grain boundaries upon film formation.202 Interactions of the PCBM with PbI3− defects were found to be thermodynamically favorable, resulting in a suppression of deep trap states by at least an order of magnitude.92,202 Crucially, the PCBM reduced anion migration at defect sites in the grain boundaries.202 These effects corresponded with a significant decrease in nonradiative charge recombination. Huang and coworkers observed a 70% PL quenching of the perovskite trap sites in a film where PCBM was deposited on top of the perovskite and then annealed to allow PCBM intercalation into the perovskite grain boundaries.92 A subsequent increase in hole mobility from 30 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 114 cm2 V−1 s−1 was also measured after annealing the perovskite with PCBM for 45 minutes at 100 °C. Importantly, the authors also determined that in MAPbI3 perovskite, the surface recombination lifetimes were 1–2 orders of magnitude lower than bulk recombination lifetimes, indicating that surface recombination (i.e., at both grain boundaries and layer interfaces) dominates in devices. PCBM passivation increased the surface recombination lifetime 3-fold; however, this improvement was still much lower than the bulk recombination lifetime, suggesting further room for improvement.
Liu and coworkers expanded upon this previous work and studied the passivation efficacy in MAPbI3 perovskite films of PCBM as well as another n-type semiconductor ITIC, and p-type semiconductors p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 (or DTS) and DR3TBDTT (or DR3T) (Fig. 14a).141 These molecules decorated the perovskite grain boundaries through their abundant Lewis acid or base functional groups, acting as a bridge to enhance intergrain charge carrier transport. PCBM molecules formed radicals with halides and acted as Lewis acids to passivate the Pb–I antisite defects (Fig. 14b). Conversely, ITIC, DTS, and D3RT with their carbonyl and cyano groups behaved as Lewis bases, passivating under-coordinated Pb2+ sites. All additives interacted strongly with the perovskite precursors and facilitated the heterogeneous nucleation and growth of the crystalline solvate (MAPbI3·DMSO), which subsequently templated the growth of smooth MAPbI3 films with fewer grain boundaries.

Energy band alignment was found to play an important factor in defect passivation as well.141 ITIC and DR3T had small energy offsets with the perovskite in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), respectively, which led to more effective defect passivation and intergrain carrier transport than in PCBM and DTS (Fig. 14c). The band alignment also corresponded with the best performing devices, with devices incorporating ITIC and DR3T achieving maximum PCEs of 19.04% and 19.28%, respectively, compared to 17.52% for pristine MAPbI3 devices (Fig. 14d). The stability of unencapsulated devices was subsequently determined by aging them in both high moisture (50% RH in air) and high temperature conditions (80 °C in an inert environment). Devices with DR3T performed the best in the high moisture conditions, retaining 87% of their initial PCE after 40 d of moisture exposure (compared to only 64% PCE retention by the pristine MAPbI3). While the devices with DR3T were the most chemically stable, those with ITIC and DTS also showed greater chemical stability than those with PCBM, likely due to greater hydrophobicity. After 24 h exposure to the high temperature conditions, DTS was the most stable, with 91% PCE retention compared to only 55% PCE retention for the pristine MAPbI3 devices (Fig. 14e and f). All devices with additives were significantly more thermally stable than pristine MAPbI3 devices. This improved stability was attributed to the formation of hydrogen bonds between the nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine atoms of the organic semiconductors and the MA in the perovskite, which suppressed MA+ diffusion and egress from the perovskite. The stability of the devices with DTS was likely the highest because the effect was greater in these films due to the strength of the hydrogen bonding of fluorine.
Another n-type semiconductor used to passivate MAPbI3 is IT-4F, which contains many Lewis base groups such as carbonyl, cyano, thiophene, and fluorines that readily interact with under-coordinated Pb2+ sites.203 The inclusion of IT-4F led to larger grain sizes which decreased the density of trap states and improved device stability. Furthermore, when compared to pristine MAPbI3 perovskite, perovskite with IT-4F exhibited increased charge carrier mobility (22.74 cm2 V−1 s−1versus 19.08 cm2 V−1 s−1), PL lifetimes (305.4 ns versus 87.9 ns), Voc (1.12 V versus 1.06 V), and PCE (18.34% versus 15.75%). Critically, these large improvements only occurred when IT-4F was deposited via anti-solvent and allowed to penetrate the perovskite grain boundaries; much smaller improvements were observed if the IT-4F was deposited as a separate layer between the perovskite and the ETL, again highlighting the importance of passivation of perovskite grain boundaries.

3.2 Polymeric additives for 3D perovskites
While small molecules are effective passivating agents for perovskite defects, drawbacks such as high volatility, high diffusion rates, and mechanical fragility of these small molecules suggests that macromolecules such as polymers could be superior passivating agents for long term device stability.204,205 Polymers comprise many repeat units with abundant functional groups and exhibit the same chemistries as small molecules with perovskite precursors—such as forming hydrogen bonds with MA+ and coordinating with Pb2+ or I− to stabilize the surfaces of perovskites—leading to higher interaction energies with increasing polymer length.86,204,206–208 These chemistries and the covalent bonding between adjacent functional groups that interact with the perovskite surfaces can also improve perovskite stability through intergrain crosslinking.204 Furthermore, polymers also can impart the unique property of increased flexibility of perovskite films due to the long molecular chains which can entangle with each other and bolster the mechanical toughness of the films.209
Polymer additives for perovskites are also typically Lewis bases, and several common additives are shown in Fig. 15.
 Fig. 15  The chemical structure of selected polymeric additives used in 3D perovskites. 

3.2.1 O-donor polymers. 
Like small molecule additives, the interactions of polymeric additives with perovskites are frequently Lewis acid–base interactions (Table 5). One of the most prevalent classes of Lewis base additive polymers are based on O-donors. O-donors can contain the oxygen atoms along the backbone in ether groups, such as poly(ethylene glycol), as part of carbonyl groups like poly(vinylpyrrolidone) or poly(methyl methacrylate), or a combination of carbonyl groups and ether groups such as in polyimide.

Poly(ethylene glycol)/poly(ethylene oxide) (PEG/PEO)—referred to as simply PEG for the remainder of this review—can enhance the wetting of the precursor solution and interact with growing perovskite crystals through hydrogen bonding, resulting in slower crystallization and a more homogeneous morphology.86,210–213 PEG was first reported as an additive in perovskite precursor solutions by Su and coworkers and was demonstrated to tune the morphology of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite layer by retarding the growth and aggregation of perovskite crystals.214 The resulting perovskite film was smooth and uniform, and devices with just 1 wt% PEG demonstrated increased Voc, Jsc, and PCE.214 Later, Zhao and coworkers found that the inclusion of PEG into MAPbI3 formed a polymer scaffold which imparted the property of “self-healing”—in this case, reforming perovskite from PbI2—after exposure to high humidity (Fig. 16a and b).86 The device performance and stability were dependent on the molecular weight (MW) and concentration of the PEG; devices with higher molecular weights (>20000 Da) and concentrations (20 or 40 mg mL−1) were found to be optimal (Fig. 16c and d). The highest efficiency device (PCE ∼ 16%) incorporated 20000 Da PEG at a concentration of 20 mg mL−1 in the precursor solution, while the device with the greatest stability was achieved by increasing the concentration of PEG to 40 mg mL−1 (Fig. 16d and e). Importantly, the PEG-infused perovskite showed surprising self-healing behavior after 60 s of water vapor exposure, recovering its original phase and PCE after 45 s in ambient air (Fig. 16f). This behavior was attributed to the PEG interacting strongly with the MAI solvated by the water, which prevented full dissolution and irreparable damage to the perovskite (Fig. 16g). Like other additives, PEG passivates under-coordinated defect sites on the surface, resulting in improved photovoltage and stability.215 Petrozza and coworkers found that passivating the surface of MAPbI3 with PEG resulted in a film that was twice as emissive as pristine perovskite, an effect not observed when polystyrene (PS) was included instead.215 The addition of PEG also increased the PL lifetime relative to pristine MAPbI3, while the addition of PS decreased the relative PL lifetime. PEG was thus effective at passivating defect sites and suppressing nonradiative recombination pathways, while PS resulted in more nonradiative recombination. Further characterization of MAPbI3 with PEG films showed an FTIR shift of the C–O stretching from 1060 cm−1 to 1030 cm−1 and a decrease in XPS binding energies of the Pb 4f core level when compared to pristine MAPbI3 films. These observations indicated that the C–O bond in PEG shared an electron pair with Pb2+ and formed Pb–O bonds that passivated anion vacancies.

(g) Schematic representation of the mechanisms of self-healing in perovskite films incorporating PEG scaffolds. The water is absorbed onto the perovskite, which then converts to PbI2 and MAI. The PEG prevents MAI egress and allows formation of perovskite again once the water evaporates by the following steps: (1) water absorbs onto the perovskite; (2) perovskite hydrolyzes into PbI2 and MAI·H2O; and (3) MAI restrained by PEG reacts with nearby PbI2 to form perovskite again after water evaporates.

Other O-donor polymers comprising repeat units that incorporate carbonyl functional groups are also excellent additives for perovskites due to strong Lewis acid–base interactions with under-coordinated surface Pb2+ atoms. Common examples of some of these polymers are poly(vinylpyrrolidone),206,216–219 poly(methyl methacrylate),87,207,220–222 poly(acrylic acid),206 and polyimides.208,223,224 Poly(vinylpyrrolidone), poly(methyl methacrylate), and poly(acrylic acid) are vinyl polymers, composed of a hydrophobic carbon backbone and pendant functional groups that repeat on every other carbon. Polyimides consist of imides along the backbone (a nitrogen atom bonded to two carbonyl groups), either in linear, or more often, in aromatic heterocyclic rings.
The functional groups of poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) are 5-membered lactams, a cyclic amide group with a carbonyl functional group. The carbonyl groups can form hydrogen-bonds with perovskite precursors to tune the grain size and improve the chemical and mechanical stability of devices. Reichmanis and coworkers showed that grain size could be controllably tuned by increasing polymer concentration, with 4, 8, and 12 wt% PVP resulting in grain sizes of 100, 210, and 350 nm, respectively; however, these grains were still smaller than in PVP-free perovskite (400 nm).217 Device efficiency for solar cells incorporating PVP were also lower (PCE of 17.05% for 8 wt% versus 18.40% for PVP-free devices), a consequence of Jsc decreasing monotonically with PVP concentration. This decreasing current density suggested that the insulating polymer was preventing efficient charge transport to the transport layers. Despite this poorer device efficiency, PVP inclusion still benefitted device stability, with 80% PCE retention after aging for 600 h in ambient conditions (room temperature with RH ranging from ∼56–79%); PVP-free devices failed nearly completely after just over 200 h exposure to the same conditions. The authors also demonstrated improved bending stability of devices with PVP, with 73% PCE retention (compared to 5% for the PVP-free devices) after 1000 bending cycles at a 0.5 cm radius (∼1–2% strain).217 At lower PVP concentrations, the benefits of inhibiting nonradiative recombination can overcome the decreases in grain size. With the addition of just 0.6 mg mL−1 PVP, device efficiency improved from 16.28% for a pristine device to a hysteresis-free 17.50%.218 PVP also has beneficial effects on (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 perovskite; when mixed with the perovskite precursors, PVP has forms a MA/FAX–PbX2–PVP intermediate complex by coordination of the carbonyl group with Pb2+. This complex effectively negated the differences in crystallization rates between MA/FAX and PbX2 and improved the film uniformity.219 Again, the PVP localized in the grain boundaries and actively passivated under-coordinated Pb2+. Devices comprising (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 perovskite and PVP active layers had an increased Voc (from 1.13 to 1.17 V) and PCE (from 17.47 to 19.10%) when compared to devices without PVP.
Another vinyl polymer that has been effective at passivating surface traps and suppressing nonradiative recombination in perovskite devices is poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), which has repeating methacrylate pendant groups.87,207 Grätzel and coworkers introduced PMMA as an additive to drive the polymer-templated nucleation and growth of (FAI)0.81(PbI2)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15.87 The resultant perovskite films were smooth with large oriented grains and fewer grain boundaries; solar cells fabricated from these films were highly efficient, with the champion device measured at a certified PCE of 21.02%, with 96.7% PCE retention for unencapsulated devices after two months of aging in air in the dark (compared to 86.2% for pristine devices).87 PMMA improved the quality of the perovskite films by initiating heterogeneous nucleation, which is orders of magnitude faster than homogeneous nucleation, and forming an intermediate adduct in solution that retarded the crystallization growth rate. The interaction between the PMMA carbonyls and the PbI2 were confirmed by FTIR with an observed shift in the stretching vibration wavenumber from 1735 to 1723 cm−1 of the carbonyls. PMMA has also been composited with small molecules such as C60 for efficiency and stability improvements in MAPbI3 solar cells. Priya and coworkers mixed a PMMA/C60 blend with 2D MAPbI3—formed by exfoliating a 3D perovskite crystal by methylamine—which then self-assembled back into 3D structures with PMMA and C60 localized to the grain boundaries.221 The PMMA acted as a moisture barrier that improved the stability of the perovskite and enhanced the solubility of the C60 in polar organic solvents (in this case, acetonitrile) by complexation. The C60 facilitated separation of charge carriers by forming dipole-like electric fields. This blend of additives resulted in devices with a PCE of 18.4% without any efficiency loss over 250 d of continuous 1 sun illumination in ambient conditions.
Polyimides (PI) also have prevalent carbonyl and hydroxyl groups that readily interact with perovskite surfaces. Yu et al. studied the introduction of two polyimide-based polymers into MAPbI3 and found that interactions with the carbonyl groups of the PIs and Pb2+ of the perovskite as well as hydrogen bonding with methylammonium at the perovskite surface slowed down the perovskite crystallization and passivated surface defects.208 Integration of poly(amic acid), the higher performance polyimide, into the perovskite at a concentration of 0.0497 mg mL−1 increased grain sizes from 100 nm to ∼300 nm, carrier lifetimes from 23.3 ns to 25–26 ns, and device efficiencies from 14.16 ± 0.54% to 16.80 ± 0.63%.208


3.2.2 N-donor polymers. 
N-donor polymers such as poly(vinylpyridine) and poly(ethylene imine) are of interest because they are slightly softer Lewis bases than O-donors, and therefore should have improved Lewis acid–base interactions with Pb2+.162
Poly(vinylpyridine) (PVPy) comprises an aliphatic backbone with abundant pyridine pendant groups that can act as Lewis bases and strongly coordinate with Pb2+ sites at the surface of the perovskite. In 2017, Miyasaka and coworkers observed that PVPy-modified films exhibited improved surface coverage with less pinholes and grain boundaries when compared to pristine MAPbI3 films.225 The pyridine groups of the PVPy decreased surface trap states and inhibited nonradiative recombination by filling the iodine vacancies and interacting with the under-coordinated Pb2+ over the surface of perovskite. Due to its large band gap, PVPy acted as an insulating barrier,225,226 and suppressed the interfacial charge recombination between perovskite and the hole transport layer. As a result, solar cells with PVPy showed a 30% improvement of PCE over pristine devices from 11.5 to 15%, mostly from a large increase of Voc from 0.89 to 1.05 V.225 Moreover, the hydrophobicity of PVPy enhanced the stability of perovskite devices. When exposed to 50% RH at room temperature for 30 days, devices incorporating PVPy retained 85% of their initial PCE, whereas pristine devices exhibited a 75% decrease in PCE under the same conditions.225
As discussed above, the strength of the interaction between the perovskite precursors and additives is a key determining factor for the extent of defect passivation. Yang and coworkers demonstrated this concept in polymers by mixing MAI with either 1 vol% of branched polyethyleneimine (b-PEI), PVPy, or polyacrylic acid (PAA) in isopropanol, which was then dripped onto a mesoporous PbI2 film to form MAPbI3 (Fig. 17a and b).206 All three polymers acted as Lewis bases, but with different functional groups—i.e., aminos on b-PEI, pyridines on PVPy, and carboxylic acids on PAA—that were readily accessible for the Pb2+ sites. The relative strength of interactions of these polymers with MAPbI3 were characterized by DFT calculations, with the binding energies to MAPbI3 for amino, pyridine, and carboxylic functional groups found to be 51.88, 37.70, and 15.71 kJ mol−1, respectively. The strength of these interactions resulted in precipitate formation and gelation in precursor solutions incorporating b-PEI and PVPy, while solutions with the more weakly-interacting PAA did not initiate these undesirable effects. Precipitation and gelation made one-step processing impossible; therefore, a two-step deposition process by interdiffusion of the MAI and polymer into a still wet PbI2 film was necessary. While the strength of the binding of the polymers to the perovskite surface resulted in processing difficulties, these interactions were expected to correlate to more effective passivation of trap states in formed films. Devices with PAA and PVPy followed this expected trend, leading to improved device performance; on a reverse scan basis, the PCE increased from 16.91 ± 0.68% for pristine perovskite devices to 17.94 ± 0.74% with PAA and 18.82 ± 0.84% with PVPy added (Fig. 17c). The increase in efficiency corresponded with a decrease in nonradiative recombination as indicated by the significant PL intensity increases of ∼700% in perovskite with PVPy and ∼650% with PAA (Fig. 17d). Devices with PVPy also exhibited improved stability when encapsulated and stored in a glovebox (Fig. 17e), retaining more than 85% of initial PCE after 2500 h, compared to just 59% retention for the pristine perovskite device. Despite the excellent performance of devices with the N-donor PVPy, adding b-PEI to the perovskite had a surprising deleterious effect on PCE (15.8 ± 0.73%) and PL intensity (70% decrease), indicating that b-PEI increased nonradiative recombination. The authors attributed the poor performance of devices with b-PEI to the chemistry of the amino groups, which could be protonated when mixed with MAI. The formed ammonium groups then interacted with the perovskite ionically, and electron withdrawing interactions with I− weakened the Pb–I bond to induce trap states.

3.2.3 Conjugated polymers. 
An emerging group of passivating agents for perovskites are conjugated polymers, which provide the same benefits as insulating polymers, but also enhance charge transport at the grain boundaries like their conjugated small molecule counterparts (Table 6).227–230 Given the additional functionalities of conjugated polymers over insulating polymers for applications in electronic devices, this area of research is one that will continue to be highly relevant for the field going forward.

Poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophe-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))], or simply PBDB-T, is a p-type semiconducting polymer that has been successfully used to enhance the properties of triple cation (CsPbI3)0.04(FAPbI3)0.82(MAPbBr3)0.14 perovskite (Fig. 18a).227 PBDB-T was selected due to its excellent performance in organic solar cells and high hole mobility, as well as its ability to coordinate with the perovskite through its carbonyl groups. Pristine perovskite devices exhibited a PCE as high as 17.28%, while the addition of 1.0 mg mL−1 PBDB-T into the anti-solvent used for perovskite film formation during spin coating increased the PCE to 19.85%. Furthermore, devices with PBDB-T retained nearly 90% PCE after aging in air at room temperature and 25% RH for 150 d. Without PBDB-T, the triple cation perovskite films include PbI2; the addition of PBDB-T reduces the concentration of PbI2 in the film and eliminates it entirely above a concentration of 1.0 mg mL−1 in the anti-solvent, indicating that PBDB-T is suppressing the growth of PbI2 that would otherwise occur at the grain boundaries. Perovskite formed with PBDB-T was also observed to have grain boundaries that aligned perpendicular to the surface, rather than at an angle, effectively reducing grain boundary area while maintaining similar sized grains. Furthermore, the surface contact potential difference between the grain boundaries and grain interiors was reduced when compared to pristine perovskite, indicating that PBDB-T improved charge transport at the grain boundaries. Interestingly, the addition of PBDB-T reduced the PL intensity and lifetimes, likely due to either an increase in non-radiative recombination in these films or possibly rapid charge transfer to the PBDB-T (Fig. 18b); however, device efficiency and stability improved with the inclusion of the PBDB-T, suggesting that the tradeoff between increased recombination and charge transport at the grain boundaries was worthwhile (Fig. 18c and d).

The anti-solvent method was also used to incorporate poly(bithiophene imide) (PBTI), an n-type polymer, into perovskites.228 PBTI deposited both on top of the perovskite film and intercalated into the grain boundaries, reducing defect density and suppressing non-radiative recombination. PL measurements indicated that this defect passivation occurred predominantly at the grain boundaries rather than the planar interface of the perovskite and PBTI. PL in PBTI-based films after prolonged exposure to 50 mW cm−2 illumination were more stable than control devices, suggesting that PBTI was effective at inhibiting iodide migration (Fig. 18e). Furthermore, the addition of PBTI also resulted in the reduction of the device series resistance, likely due to grain boundary passivation and possibly the conjugated nature of the additive itself. These characteristics resulted in a PCE increase from 18.89% for the control to 20.67% with the addition of PBTI (Fig. 18f). Under 1 sun exposure in ambient conditions (room temperature and ∼35% RH), devices with PBTI had a T80 (time to only 80% retention of initial PCE) of 160 h, which was four times longer than devices without PBTI (Fig. 18g). Furthermore, after 600 h of 1 sun exposure, devices with PBTI retained 70% of their initial PCE compared to just 56% for the control devices.
More recently, Kyaw and coworkers used a dithienobenzodithiophene-based polymer (PDTBDT-FBT) that resulted in 90% PCE retention after 1000 h at room temperature and 60% RH.229 Unlike other conjugated polymer additives for perovskites, PDTBDT-FBT contains fluorine atoms, which interacted favorably with the perovskite to form Pb–F bonds that passivated defects at both the surface and within the grain boundaries. The trap state density was found to be reduced from 1.91 × 1016 cm−3 to 1.45 × 1016 cm−3 and resulted in increased hole mobility from 7.67 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 9.75 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 with faster charge transfer to the hole transport layer.229

3.3 Additives for 2D and quasi-2D perovskites
Two-dimensional (2D) perovskites are an emerging subclass of perovskites that exhibit greater diversity of structure and more tunable optoelectronic properties than 3D perovskites.231,232 The structural tunability—i.e., crystallographic orientation and number of layers—provided by 2D perovskites is much greater than in 3D perovskites. Among the three 2D perovskite crystallographic orientations—(100), (110), and (111) (Fig. 19)—the (100)-oriented 2D perovskites are the most commonly reported.233 The general formula of these (100)-oriented perovskites is A′2An−1BnX3n+1 or A′An−1BnX3n+1, corresponding to Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) or Dion–Jacobson (DJ) 2D perovskites, respectively.234 In these cases, A′ is typically a monovalent or divalent aromatic or alkyl ammonium cation that anchors on the surface of 2D perovskite crystallites (An−1BnX3n+1)2− and the subscript n represents the number of BX6 octahedra layers (i.e., the thickness of the perovskite layers).

(a) (100)-oriented layered perovskites have a general formula of (RNH3)2An−1BnX3n+1. (b) (110)-oriented perovskites have a general formula of A′2AmBmX3m+2. (c) (111)-oriented perovskites have a general formula of A′2Aq−1BqX3q+3. Reprinted with permission from B. Saparov et al., Chem. Rev., 2016, 116 (7), 4558–4569.

While Ruddlesden–Popper and Dion–Jacobson phases both generate 2D perovskite phases, they are fundamentally different in composition. RP 2D perovskites comprise a bimolecular layer of monoammonium (or other monofunctional) spacers between adjacent sheets of perovskite crystals. These ammonium heads of these spacers anchor to the perovskite via hydrogen bonding, while their alkyl tails interdigitate with monoammonium spacers of adjacent sheets, holding the films together by van der Waals interactions.235 The interdigitation of the monoammonium spacers causes adjacent perovskite crystallites to be displaced by half a unit cell, resulting in a staggered arrangement of the perovskite sheets.236 Conversely, in DJ perovskites, the perovskite sheets are bridged by diammonium (or other difunctional) spacers, with the two ammonium groups of the molecule anchoring adjacent sheets together. This bridging eliminates the van der Waals gap in RP 2D perovskite, and results in better stacking orientation of adjacent perovskite sheets.236 However, diammonium spacers with long alkyl chains between the ammonium heads can allow a high freedom of motion, resulting in staggered stacking of the perovskites sheets.237 In general, the improved packing of DJ perovskites compared to RP perovskites inhibits thermally induced electron–phonon coupling, reduces non-radiative recombination, and prolongs the carrier lifetime.238
The alternating organic and inorganic layers present in 2D perovskites results in different material behavior than in 3D perovskites. For example, having the semiconductor crystals surrounded by insulating material results in the formation of a multiple quantum well structure,239 with quantum and dielectric confinement effects enabling a larger exciton binding energy and enhanced radiative recombination than in 3D perovskites, properties that are favorable for applications in LEDs.240 The band gap of 2D perovskite can also be tuned by the layer thickness, with an inverse correlation between the band gap and the number of perovskite layers, that is the band gap increases as the value of n decreases.241,242 Furthermore, 2D perovskite exhibits enhanced moisture stability due to the bulky organic cations surrounding the crystallites imparting hydrophobicity to the films.243
The synthesis of 2D perovskites occurs with many of the same bulky organic additives used in 3D perovskites, only added at higher concentrations.244–247 These large organic cations reside in the A site of the perovskite crystal, with concentration playing an important role in determining the dimensions of perovskite. In general, at low concentrations, the additives will anchor on the surface of 3D perovskite and reside in the grain boundaries, passivating surface defects with little effect on the 3D structure of perovskites. However, as the additive concentration is increased (usually to higher than 5 mol%), the 3D crystal structure becomes less stable compared to a 2D or quasi-2D structure (i.e., the Goldschmidt tolerance factor is no longer in the stable 3D perovskite regime).248,249
Unsurprisingly, the thickness of the perovskite layers, n, is highly dependent on the concentration of the additive. The additives bind to the available sites on both the top and bottom surfaces of the crystallite sheets, which comprise the vast majority of the crystallite surface area, allowing n to be estimated as the ratio of Pb to additive multiplied by 2. For example, if the molar ratio of Pb to the additive is 20:1 (i.e., an additive concentration of 5 mol% relative to Pb), the resultant perovskite has n = 40. In this example, the concentration of additive is sufficiently low (and n sufficiently high) that the films exhibit the properties of 3D perovskites; these films are generally described as 2D/3D mixed dimensional perovskites.250 As the additive concentration is increased, the perovskite films become more quasi-2D (n > 1) in nature. There is generally a heterogeneous distribution of number of perovskite layers per crystallite, with the n value describing the average number of layers per crystallite.251 Homogeneous quasi-2D films have been demonstrated with an n as high as 7, at an additive concentration of ∼28.6 mol% relative to Pb.252 Further increasing the additive concentration to twice the Pb molar ratio will result in a homogeneous 2D perovskite (n = 1).241

3.3.1 Ammonium additives for low-dimensional perovskites. 
Many bulky organic cations have been reported for the formation of 2D perovskites, with the most commonly reported in the literature being phenylethylammonium (PEA)239,251,253–256 and butylammonium (BA).242,257–260 Lesser reported monoammonium cations include as iso-butylammonium (iso-BA),261 naphthylmethylammonium (NMA),262,263 and cyclopropylamine (CA),264 while diammoniums such as ethane-1,2-diammonium (EDA),265 propane-1,3-diammonium (PDA),266 butane-1,4-diammonium (BDA),237,267 hexane-1,6-diammonium (HDA)237,267 and octane-1,8-diammonium (ODA)237,267 and amino acids such as 5-ammonium valeric acid (5-AVA)268 and glycine (Gly)269 have also been applied in the synthesis of 2D perovskite (Fig. 20).
 Fig. 20  The chemical structure of selected ammonium-based additives used in the formation of 2D and quasi-2D perovskite. 
Phenylethylammonium exhibits a large ionic radius that cannot fit into the corner-sharing BX6 octahedra network, leading to the exfoliation of the 3D perovskite structure into a 2D structure.241 In addition to driving the formation of 2D perovskite, PEA has been shown to reduce the density of defects and improve the optical properties of low-dimensional perovskites.270 PEA has the distinction of being perhaps the earliest additive employed in perovskites; in 1992, Nurmikko and coworkers first synthesized 2D (PEA)2PbI4 and (PEA)2(MA)Pb2I7 perovskites and demonstrated their enhanced exciton binding energy was due to the dielectric confinement effects.239 Later, Saito and coworkers first applied 2D layered (PEA)2PbI4 perovskites into LED devices and reported the strong electroluminescence phenomenon of this material.253 An intense green emission with a narrow bandwidth was observed at liquid-nitrogen temperature (−196 °C); however, the electroluminescence efficiency was very small at room temperature due to the thermal quenching of photoluminescence of the 2D (PEA)2PbI4 film. The requirement of a low working temperature limited the development of perovskite LEDs for nearly 20 years until Friend and coworkers achieved near-infrared and visible electroluminescence of 3D perovskite at room temperature in 2014.6 These early devices suffered from very low EQEs—0.76% for near-infrared and 0.1% for green LED devices.6 Jin and coworkers extended these results to fabricate a room-temperature violet electroluminescence LED based on 2D (PEA)2PbBr4 perovskite.254 Micrometer-sized (PEA)2PbBr4 nanoplates with high crystallinity (Fig. 21a and b) were synthesized by a solvent vapor annealing method, achieving a pure-color violet light emission at 410 nm and an EQE 20-fold higher (0.04%) than a polycrystalline (PEA)2PbBr4 film. Quasi-2D PEA-based perovskite with controllable thicknesses can be made by adjusting the ratio of PEA iodide to MAI in the precursor.251 At low excitation intensities (6 mW cm−2), these quasi-2D (PEA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 perovskites exhibited PLQYs of 10.1 and 10.6% for n = 3 and 5 compared to negligible responses for 3D and 2D (n = 1) perovskite. The increased PLQY in the quasi-2D perovskite was attributed to a more efficient energy transfer process as the perovskite layers increased. Importantly, the authors found that although these quasi-2D films were expected to be single phase (e.g., n = 3 films were expected consist only of 3-layered perovskite), the films actually contained multiple phases. These phases have different band gaps, which are inversely related to n, enabling a cascade mechanism where the charge carriers are concentrated into the smallest band gap emitters, resulting in more effective radiative recombination. In this study, the best-performing near-infrared LED was achieved with an n = 5, yielding an EQE of 8.8% and a radiance of 80 W sr−1 m−2.

Similar cascade energy transfer mechanisms have been reported in other materials such as the napthylmethylammonium-based (NMA) quasi-2D perovskite multiple quantum wells (MQWs) (Fig. 21c).271,272 The rapid cascade energy transfer in MQWs limited exciton quenching, leading to a relatively high EQE of 11.7% and radiance of 82 W sr−1 m−2 in (NMA)2(FA)Pb2I6Br-based LEDs.271 The strong π–π conjugation of aromatic rings in NMA can also enhance charge transport, passivate grain boundaries to impede ion motion, and improve the thermal stability of the perovskite.263 Soci and coworkers demonstrated these effects with a series of (NMA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 perovskite with n ranging from 1 to ∞ (i.e., true 2D perovskite to 3D).263 The quasi-2D perovskites with n equal to 40 or 60 were able to withstand high temperatures of 150 °C for 90 min with no color change, whereas 3D perovskite decomposed gradually and turned yellow by 90 min. Devices made from quasi-2D perovskite with n = 60 had a measured PCE of 16.9%, higher than the 15.9% measured for 3D perovskite. These devices were also more stable when encapsulated and subjected to 360 h of heating at 85 °C, retaining 70% of their initial PCE compared to only 25% PCE retention for the 3D perovskite devices. This improved thermal stability was attributed entirely to the inclusion of the bulky organic additives.
Mixing brominated PEA (PEABr) with co-additives has been another approach to improve 2D perovskites for LED applications. In one example, Sun and coworkers used PEABr and a small amount of 1,4,7,10,13,16-hexaoxacyclooctadecane (crown) to synthesize PEA2Csn−1PbnBr3n+1 nanoplatelets.273 Devices fabricated from these nanoplatelets resulted in exceptionally high-performance green LEDs with an EQE of 15.5%, PLQY of 70%, and current efficiency of 49.1 cd A−1.273 PEABr and crown both inhibit the growth of perovskite crystals, leading to a uniform and smooth film with small grain sizes. The co-additive crown prevented the aggregation and phase separation of PEABr; hydrogen bonding and steric hindrance between crown and PEA+ inhibited π–π stacking of PEA. Thus, the PEA and perovskite crystallites were well dispersed, enhancing the dielectric confinement and suppressing nonradiative recombination. Later, Tang and coworkers used PEG as a co-additive with PEABr to fabricate green LEDs comprising quasi-2D PEA2(CsPbBr3)n−1PbBr4.259 The addition of PEABr led to the formation of multiple phases, which enhanced cascade energy transfer, while PEG passivated surface defects and reduced nonradiative combination at the grain boundaries (Fig. 22a). These perovskites were again small-grained (<15 nm) with a high EQE of 13.14% and current efficiency of 37.14 cd A−1 (Fig. 22b).259 Flexible LEDs fabricated from this material also maintained a high EQE of 10.1% and current efficiency of 31.0 cd A−1 (Fig. 22c). Another ammonium halide salt, naphthylmethylammonium iodide, was used as a co-additive with poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (poly-HEMA) to synthesize quasi 2D/3D (NMA)2(FA)n−1PbnI3n+1 perovskites that resulted in a record-high EQE for perovskite LEDs of 20.1%.274

In addition to LED devices, quasi-2D and 2D perovskites have been widely employed in solar cells.242,256,257,260 In 2014, Karunadasa and coworkers first reported high-quality (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 (n = 3) quasi-2D perovskites films as photoabsorbers in solar cells, with devices achieving a high Voc of 1.18 V, but limited efficiency of 4.73%.255 These high-quality 2D perovskite films could be synthesized by a simple one-step spin coating without further high-temperature annealing. This PEA-based perovskite also exhibited humidity resistance, retaining a stable structure after exposure to 52% RH at room temperature for 46 days.
Another common additive for the synthesis of low dimensional perovskites is butylammonium (BA).242,257,260,275–278 In 2015, Kanatzidis and coworkers fabricated a series of (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 2D/quasi-2D perovskite films with n values ranging from 1–4 by a one-step spin coating process at room temperature.242 The BA contributed to well-ordered self-assembly of the perovskite layers, with preferential growth perpendicular to the surface (in the direction most beneficial to charge transport). The highest PCE (4.02%) was achieved when n = 3, and the hydrophobic nature of the alkyl chains of the BA enhanced the moisture stability of the quasi-2D films. Films of (BA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 (n = 3) remained stable after exposure to 40% RH for 2 months, with no PbI2 measurable by XRD. Huang and coworkers attributed the enhanced stability to suppressed ion migration in both out-of-plane and in-plane directions.279,280 The ion migration stability was compared in polycrystalline and single crystal 3D MAPbI3 and 2D (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 perovskites by temperature dependent conductivity measurements. An obvious temperature-dependent transition from electronic (low temperature region) to ionic (high temperature region) conduction was observed in the 3D perovskites, whereas the ion activation energy was constant (41 ± 7 meV for polycrystalline and 25 ± 3 meV for single crystal) in 2D perovskites. The constant ion activation energy in 2D perovskite indicated that electronic conduction was the dominant mechanism over a wide range of temperature. Furthermore, the formation energies of I (VI) and MA (VMA) vacancies—which are associated with ion migration—were much higher in 2D (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 (VI = 5.46 and VMA = 6.94 eV) than in 3D MAPbI3 (VI = 3.44 and VMA = 5.72 eV), indicating that 2D perovskites have lower defect density than their 3D counterparts.280
Amino acids have also been used to form quasi-2D perovskites, such as the 5-AVA-based 2D/3D (AVA)2PbI4/MAPbI3 developed by Nazeeruddin and coworkers.268 Optimized mesoporous solar cells comprising these materials (3% AVAI added) exhibited a PCE of 14.6% and maintained up to 60% of its initial PCE after 300 h under continuous illumination in an argon atmosphere.


3.3.2 Tuning the low dimensional crystallite structure with additives. 
Although 2D and quasi-2D perovskites have superior chemical stability when compared to 3D perovskites, low PCEs have thus far prevented these materials from being commercially viable. The lower efficiencies of 2D and quasi-2D perovskite devices are in part a result of the larger band gaps and exciton binding energies than in 3D perovskites—stemming from quantum and dielectric confinement effects—which lead to low carrier mobility.241,281 Many approaches have been proposed to improve the carrier transport and PCEs of 2D and quasi-2D perovskite, including increasing the crystal thickness (i.e., n values),241,282 and preparing perovskites with vertical orientation.283,284 Sargent and coworkers prepared a series of (PEA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 pure 2D (n = 1), quasi-2D (n > 1), and 3D (n = ∞) perovskites (Fig. 23a) and investigated their properties through theoretical calculations and experiments, with hysteresis-free efficiencies as high as 15.3% demonstrated (Fig. 23b).241 Improved stability was observed in 2D perovskites, attributed to enhanced van der Waals interactions of the cation PEAI compared to MAI, which enabled higher formation energies of pure and quasi-2D perovskite. While these pure 2D or low n (<10) quasi-2D perovskites exhibited excellent stability, low carrier mobility and lifetime led to severe radiative recombination losses. Conversely, high n (≥40) quasi-2D perovskites possessed enhanced mobility, longer carrier lifetimes and diffusion lengths, and much better stability than 3D perovskites (Fig. 23c). Optimization of the number of layers in quasi-2D perovskites is an effective strategy to balance stability and performance, and certainly one that warrants further investigation to optimize for different compositions and applications.

Impeded charge transport due to inhibition of out-of-plane charge transport by the bulky insulating organic cations contributes to the low PCE of 2D perovskite solar cells. To address this issue, Mohite and coworkers fabricated perovskite that preferentially grew with an alignment perpendicular to the substrate to allow for charges to more readily diffuse to the charge transport layers.257 Using hot-casting, a nearly single crystalline (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 perovskite film was fabricated with large grains of ∼400 nm.257 The vertical-oriented structure facilitated continuous and efficient charge transport and enhanced mobility in the perovskite, with solar cells fabricated from these perovskites exhibiting hysteresis-free PCEs of 12.52%. Orienting perovskite crystallites by hot-casting typically requires precisely controlled temperature, which can be challenging for device reproducibility and scalable fabrication.
Using additives to control the alignment of 2D perovskite crystallites is of clear significant technological relevance, though, as the preferred alignment direction for beneficial charge transport—e.g., perpendicular to the substrate in photovoltaics or parallel to the substrate in transistors—is application specific. Therefore, other fabrication processes that are more scalable than hot-casting have been developed for orienting 2D perovskites. For example, Chen and coworkers introduced ammonium thiocyanate (NH4SCN) together with BA or PEA to synthesize highly crystalline (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 or (PEA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 2D perovskite films with preferred vertical alignment.283,285 The strong interactions of the S and N in NH4SCN with Pb2+ regulated the morphology of perovskite films and contributed to the vertical growth of the crystallites. Vertical orientation is not only beneficial to charge transport in PSCs—it also reduces defect density that inhibits nonradiative recombination and leads to enhanced PCEs. For example, (PEA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 5) with NH4SCN added exhibits a PCE of 11.01% compared to just 0.56% for the same material without NH4SCN added. Co-additives of DMSO and thiosemicarbazide (TSC) have also been used to fabricate vertically oriented 2D (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 films.286 The synergistic interactions of DMSO and TSC with the perovskite precursors led to a low density of large nuclei that were more conducive to forming large and preferred oriented grains (Fig. 23d). The addition of TSC induced precursor aggregation, forming large BAI·MAI·PbI2·DMSO·TSC or/and BAI·MAI·PbI2·TSC adducts by the strong Lewis acid–base interaction with PbI2. DMSO, which was also a Lewis base, effectively slowed down solvent evaporation and crystal growth resulting in a vertically oriented 2D film with large grain sizes (Fig. 23e). These films had low defect density and efficient carrier transport and PSC devices fabricated from them exhibited markedly enhanced PCEs of 14.15% compared to just 1.05% for the devices without additives.
Liang and coworkers demonstrated that simple changes to the molecular structure of the additive can also have large effects on crystallization and orientation. They used a short branched-chain butylamine (iso-BA) as a spacer to form a room temperature processed (iso-BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13.261 Compared to fabricating 2D perovskite with a linear butylamine spacer, the iso-BA increased crystallization and enhanced out-of-plane orientation. Moreover, the iso-BA resulted in decreased intercrystallite spacing, enhancing out-of-plane carrier mobility more than two orders of magnitude (1.35 cm2 V−1 s−1versus 0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1 for perovskite with the linear BA). Consequently, 2D PSCs based on iso-BA yielded a higher PCE than those based on linear BA (8.82% versus 2.27%). The PCE of iso-BA based 2D perovskite was further improved to 10.63% when using the hot-casting method. A potentially industrially relevant drop-casting method has been demonstrated in air at low temperatures (50–60 °C) and resulted in a highly vertical oriented 2D (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 perovskite film.275 Devices based on this method had a high certified PCE of 14.33% ± 0.34 and were stable for more than 5 months in an inert environment. The scalability of this approach was demonstrated via slot-die coating, with devices prepared by batch and roll-to-roll coating exhibiting PCEs of 12.5% and 8%, respectively.
The nature of the chemical interactions between the butyl amine spacer and the perovskite can also influence orientation. For example, replacing n-butylamine iodide (BAI) with n-butylamine acetate (BAAc) can significantly improve the vertical alignment of low-dimensional perovskites.287 BAAc perovskites are highly phase-pure (i.e., nearly monodisperse)—attributed to the strong ionic interactions between the perovskite precursors and the acetate—which results in a gelled intermediate phase with a very narrow size distribution (∼0.6 nm) of perovskite particles. When compared to BAI perovskite solutions, with particle sizes ranging from ∼1 nm to several microns, the nearly monodisperse distribution of particles in BAAc perovskites is a significant improvement. The PCE of BAAc perovskite devices was 16.25% with a Voc of 1.31 V, compared to a PCE of 13.81% and a Voc of 1.12 V for BAI perovskite devices. Unencapsulated devices of the phase-pure BAAc perovskite showed minimal degradation compared to the BAI perovskite. After 4680 h at ambient conditions with 65 ± 10% RH, the BAAc perovskite device exhibited 93.8% PCE retention compared to just 49.4% for the BAI perovskite device. Likewise, after continuous heating at 85 °C in an N2-filled glovebox for 558 h, PCE retention for the BAAc perovskite device was 95.7% compared to 59.1% for the BAI perovskite device. Finally, after 1100 h of continuous illumination, PCE retention for the BAAc perovskite device was 96.2% compared to just 70.8% for the BAI perovskite device. These stability enhancements of the BAAc devices were attributed to the thinness of the vertically-aligned phase-pure perovskite, which was completely protected by the butylammonium spacers. The poly-disperse BAI perovskite films were also-well protected, but some of the crystals were large and the lower spacer-to-perovskite ratio in these crystals left them less protected.242,287
Prolonged annealing of these materials can lead to further alignment improvements. Zhou and coworkers demonstrated that multi-phased (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 perovskite will realign along the vertical direction after annealing at 60 °C for 60 h under N2 atmosphere.260 This annealing led to a favorable distribution of perovskite (n = 1 − ∞ with lower n perovskite at the bottom and higher n at the top), resulting in finer energy gradients with more efficient charge transport and extraction due to elimination of the potential barriers induced by quantum wells. When PSCs were fabricated combining hot-casting with this slow post-annealing method, an impressive enhanced PCE of 17.26% was demonstrated with a 96% PCE retention after 2000 h under N2 atmosphere.


3.3.3 Additives for enhancing charge transport in low dimensional perovskite. 
The insulating effects of organic cations can also be mitigated by using diammonium cations additives that strengthen the interactions between adjacent perovskite crystallites.234 2D perovskites incorporating monoammonium cations form perovskite crystals surrounded by organic bimolecular layers that interact through weak van der Waals forces, while 2D perovskites incorporating diammonium cations form perovskite crystals that are bridged by the cations through stronger electrostatic interactions. This bridging will reduce the spacer distance between inorganic layers, enhancing the charge transport while maintaining high stability (Fig. 24a). For example, Kanatzidis and coworkers synthesized a series of multilayer 2D perovskites (NH3CmH2mNH3) (MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (m = 4–9, n = 1–4) by incorporating diammonium cations with different lengths of alkyl chain.237 The diammonium cations bridged two perovskite layers, folding like compressed springs between them. Comparing 2D perovskite films incorporating an 8-carbon diammonium—i.e., (NH3C8H16NH3)(MA)2Pb3I10—to those incorporating a 4-carbon monoammonium—i.e., (BA)2(MA)2Pb3I10—showed similar d-spacings and optical properties. However, the perovskite films with monoammonium had a mostly random orientation while the diammonium additive instead drove the perovskite orientation perpendicular to the substrate, more favorable for the vertical charge transport required in solar cell applications. While the 8-carbon diammonium was promising, large organic cations with high insulating carbon content can inhibit charge transport. Lee and coworkers addressed this problem by synthesizing 2D perovskite with a much shorter 3-carbon propane diammonium (PDA) to form (PDA)MAn−1PbnI3n+1.266 The addition of PDA reduced the spacing of adjacent perovskite crystals to 2 Å, less than one third of the d-spacing of BA-based 2D perovskites (∼7 Å).242,266 The reduced d-spacing in the PDA-based 2D perovskites increased charge transport between adjacent perovskite layers (Fig. 24b), resulting in increased charge mobilities. Both the hole and electron mobilities for PDA-based devices were 3.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 compared to only 1.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for BA-based devices. A corresponding high PCE of 13.0% was also measured in PDA-based devices with n = 4 (Fig. 24c). Furthermore, PDA-based perovskite showed improved stability compared to BA-based perovskite with encapsulated PDA-based devices showing 90% PCE retention after storage for 1000 h (Fig. 24d) and 100% PCE retention at 70 °C for 100 h (Fig. 24e).266 While further research into using diammonium cation additives—or, perhaps any “crosslinking” additive—is necessary, this route towards improving charge transport in 2D perovskites is quite promising.

As discussed previously, intergrain charge transport in perovskites can be enhanced with the inclusion of conjugated additives. In the case of low-dimensional perovskites, initial theoretical investigations suggested that DJ-based perovskites bridged by conjugated small molecules could have tunable band gaps and band alignment through adjustments to the molecular structure of the additives.288,289 The bands of electron donating additives are typically aligned above those of the perovskite (with the additive HOMO within the perovskite band gap), resulting in a HOMO band localized to the additives and the LUMO band to the perovskites. Conversely, the bands of electron accepting additives are shifted down and the LUMO of the additive is now in the perovskite band gap, resulting in a LUMO band localized to the additives and the HOMO band to the perovskites.288 These bands could be further tuned by adding electron donating groups to the additives to shift the energy bands up or by adding electron withdrawing groups to shift the energy bands down. For example, DFT calculations showed that simple substitutions on 2,7-dibutylammonium[1]benzothieno[3,2-b]-[1]benzothiophene (BTBT) could tune the band gap of the perovskite by manipulating the HOMO band of the additive. Adding electron donating amino groups to the aromatic core reduced the band gap of the perovskite to 1.03 eV while adding electron withdrawing fluorines increased the band gap to 2.42 eV.288
The opportunity for band gap tuning has not yet been fully taken advantage of, but early reports of devices synthesized with semiconducting spacers into low-dimensional perovskites have been promising, with derivatives of carbazole,290 perylene and pyrene,291 stilbene,292 benzothienobenzothiophene,293 and thiophene294–296 showing improved stability. This improved stability has been largely attributed to stronger interactions between adjacent additives, which improve ordering of the perovskite crystals. The most extensive studies of one molecular family have been undertaken by Dou and coworkers, who have focused the thiophene-based additives.294–296 Sn-based perovskite transistors incorporating the thiophene derivative 2-(3′′′,4′-dimethyl-[2,2′:5′,2′′:5′′,2′′′-quaterthiophen]-5-yl)ethan-1-ammonium (4Tm) exhibited hole and electron mobilities of 2.32 and 1.78 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which was an order of magnitude higher than transistors incorporating PEA instead.294 In this case, the additive itself did not participate in the improved charge carrier mobility. Rather, the increased mobility was attributed in part to increased grain size, due to the thermal stability imparted by 4Tm allowing perovskite processing temperatures as high as 180 °C. Environmental stability enhancements were observed as well, with unencapsulated transistors incorporating 4Tm retaining field-effect behavior after a month in air (compared to ∼1 day for transistors with PEA). The high stability of these devices was credited to the bulkiness and hydrophobicity of the 4Tm additive as well as improved crystalline stability of the perovskite due to intermolecular interactions between the 4Tm molecules. The determined strength of the intermolecular interactions was based on structural analysis of single crystals grown with PEA or 4Tm; in perovskites with 4Tm, the Sn–I bond lengths were reduced compared to perovskites with PEA, indicative of a more contracted structure with better orbital overlap. Furthermore, improved H-bonding between the ammonium groups of 4Tm and the iodide of perovskite were also observed as evidenced by smaller bonding distances than PEA with iodide.
Device efficiencies are particularly low in true 2-D (i.e., n = 1) perovskites, due to poor out-of-plane (i.e., through the additive) conductivity given that the most commonly use additives are insulating. Significant improvements in the out-of-plane conductivity were observed with the inclusion of additives with conjugated moieties when compared to those with aliphatic moieties, increasing from ∼10−7 S m−1 for n-butylammonium perovskite to 4 × 10−5 S m−1 for perovskite with a perylene derivative.291 The authors found two molecular contributions mattered with respect to improving charge transport in these materials. The first is that the preferred packing of the additives bound to adjacent perovskite crystallites should be edge-to-face packing rather than edge-to-edge, since edge-to-face packing results in better molecular orbital overlap (Fig. 25a). The second is that the perovskite and additives should have excellent energy level alignment. Given these insights, the authors were able to fabricate reproducible devices based on a pyrene derivative which exhibited strong edge-to-face alignment of the additives, yielding an average PCE of 1.14 ± 0.11% and a champion device of 1.38%. This champion device was particularly impressive, because despite the perovskite alignment being parallel to the substrate, the device exhibited the highest reported efficiency of any n = 1 perovskite at the time, besting even devices where the perovskite aligned perpendicular to the surface (in the direction of charge transport).297 Still higher efficiency pure 2D perovskite devices have been achieved by including dication additives, such as imidazolium ethyl ammonium (ImEA), which reduced the perovskite interlayer distance to 4.149 Å (Fig. 25b).298 These ImEA dications (and other dications where one of the positive charges was on the aromatic core) decreased distortions in Pb–I–Pb bond angles (i.e., larger bond angles) relative to diammonium additives (Fig. 25c and d). The reduction in bond angle distortions stems from the positively charged aromatic rings having relatively lower charge density than ammonium groups, reducing the coulombic driving force for the Pb–I octahedra toward the dications. The resultant larger Pb–I–Pb bond angles are more favorable for orbital overlap and band gap reduction, resulting in increased charge transport, and ultimately improved device efficiency.298 Using the strategy of reduction of Pb–I–Pb bond angle distortion, Wang and coworkers introduced a new cation, 3-aminopropionitrile; the authors claimed to have achieved a bond angle of 180°, which resulted in the highest pure 2D device efficiency reported to date of 3.39% (Fig. 25e).299

4. Opportunities for further discovery
The literature covering organic additives for metal halide perovskites is extensive, but there are still many questions left to be answered. We identify several areas where we believe that are significant opportunities for further discovery to move the metal halide perovskite field toward commercial viability.
4.1 Strength of intermolecular interactions
The strength of intermolecular interactions between the additives and the perovskite precursors is of critical importance to control the crystallization kinetics and suppression of the trap states that are known to be deleterious to device performance. What is unclear is what the optimal interaction strength is for different perovskite compositions. As the field develops more diverse materials with multiple cations, halides, and metals, these interactions become more complex and must be better understood.
In the case of Pb-based perovskites, S-donors seem to interact more strongly with perovskite precursors than O-donors157—and perhaps N-donors are stronger than S-donors135—yet the strength of interactions of other donor types with Pb2+ is still unclear. Furthermore, how the interaction strength translates to film quality and stability is not fully understood, but it is known that additives which interact very strongly with perovskite precursors in solution can lead to gelation and precipitation which requires more complex processing.206
One reference point for the interaction strength, the Gutmann donor number, is predictive of more stable solutions when high, and precipitation and single crystal formation when low.144 While precipitation can lead to more complex processing, it is possible that solutions including additives with low Gutmann donor numbers could result in films with excellent properties given that grain boundaries are deleterious to perovskite performance and stability.45,69 It would not be surprising if the growth of small crystallites in solution leads to large-grained films with improved qualities. In this case, solution aging time would need to be optimized for various solution compositions. Calculations of the formation constant, Kf, for forming perovskite octahedra have been performed by Benesi–Hildebrand analysis for some compositions, but more work needs to be performed to determine if the trends are generalizable across compositions. Yang and coworkers made some generalizable observations for the case of Lewis base interactions with Pb2+, which stated that the Lewis donor atoms: (1) should be high H-bonding acceptors, but poor H-bonding donors; (2) must be sterically accessible; and (3) similar in hardness/softness to the atoms with which they are expected to interact.153
With the increasing complexity of some perovskite compositions (e.g., mixed halide or metal perovskites), it is likely that localized interaction strength of the additives at different atoms at the crystal surfaces would vary. It is possible that multiple additives (or additives with multiple functional groups) are necessary in these cases to optimize film formation and defect passivation. We know that these compositional variations can make large differences in adduct formations; for example, DMSO is an additive that results in good adduct formation for MAPbI3, but is poor when FAI is used as a precursor instead of MAI.157 In this case, an additive with more structural similarity to the FAI (e.g., thiourea) was required.
Another factor that might play a role in the effectiveness of an additive is its boiling point. For example, urea appears to improve device performance and stability more than thiourea, which was attributed to residual thiourea remaining in the film because of its relatively higher boiling point.167 Conversely, residual polymer additives certainly remain in the film and yet still have beneficial effects for devices. It stands to reason that some additive must remain in the perovskite films to passivate the surfaces, but too much residual additive can behave as an insulator that reduces charge transport. The effect of residual additives within the grain boundaries on device performance is likely to be specific to the morphology and application; if the perovskite crystallites are continuous throughout the height of the film and charge transport occurs predominantly in the vertical direction (e.g., in a photovoltaic), it is unlikely that residual insulating material within the grain boundaries will greatly reduce device efficiency. However, in the case of a perovskite device such as a transistor, where lateral charge transport is necessary, residual insulating solvent could greatly reduce device performance.
These general trends in interactions should extend to more complex mixed solvent/additive systems, but development of a predictive model to help determine compatible mixtures before running experiments would be highly beneficial. If we could take into account additive characteristics such as relative interaction strengths and volatility, we could likely determine ideal concentrations and processing parameters for improved perovskite film quality. For example, it has already been shown that in scalable blade coating, a poorly interacting but volatile solvent mixed with a small concentration of more strongly interacting but less volatile solvent results in smooth and large-grained films.161
4.2 Molecular structure of the additives
Aside from the functional groups, which play important roles in crystallization kinetics and defect passivation, the rest of the molecular structure can also play a significant role in the film properties. For example, greater carbon content in unilateral alkyl amines resulted in smaller grain size and higher device efficiencies;179 however, in bilateral alkyl amines, increased carbon content resulted in poorer performing devices, a surprising discrepancy between the two studies.138 Bridging grains with bilateral or multifunctional additives has been shown to be a consistently fruitful path for improving perovskite performance and stability, though. Additionally, when these grains are bridged with conjugated additives, the intergranular charge transport is improved; however, the extent of necessary band alignment is unknown and could limit the materials used.141
Molecular structure can also drive preferential orientation of perovskite crystallites during growth. Additives with more rigid structures have been shown to preferentially adopt an orientation perpendicular to the substrate surface, due to impinging the perovskite crystals and limiting the freedom of motion during growth.192 Preferential vertical orientation has similarly been demonstrated with the use of polymeric additives and in diammonium additives at high enough concentrations to form quasi-2D perovskite.87,237 While preferential orientation in the vertical direction has been demonstrated through several pathways, preferential orientation in the horizontal direction, which would be beneficial for thin-film transistors, has yet to be demonstrated.
4.3 Improving device efficiency in true 2D perovskites
The high environmental stability of 2D perovskites makes these materials enticing compared to their 3D counterparts; however, poor device efficiencies must be overcome for 2D perovskites to become commercially viable as photovoltaics. Charge transport has been improved through various mechanisms such as reducing the perovskite interlayer distance,298 incorporating additives which have semiconducting characteristics and exhibit desirable molecular and band alignment,288–296 or increasing the Pb–I–Pb bond angles within the perovskite crystals.298,299 There has yet to be a magic bullet additive that addresses all of these pathways simultaneously and there is unlikely to be a large pool of candidate additives that are able to maintain low interlayer distances while also exhibiting semiconducting properties. Furthermore, finding these additives that also align in the desirable edge-to-face orientation could prove elusive. Perhaps an additive does not need to both maintain a small interlayer distance and be semiconducting, but if these cannot be done synergistically, more research is needed to determine which strategy is most likely to be successful and generalizable to many perovskite compositions. Given that the most critical parameter for improved device efficiency in true 2D devices appears to be increasing the Pb–I–Pb bond angles, developing molecular design rules for achieving this outcome is likely the highest priority.
When including quasi-2D perovskites, further work is necessary to understand what leads to phase purity—i.e., low-dimensional perovskites with monodisperse layer thicknesses. Developing improved control over phase purity in low-dimensional perovskites will allow for controllable band gaps, which could, for example, give color tunable LEDs.300 Furthermore, given that phase-pure perovskite photovoltaics with vertical alignment have already exhibited device efficiencies over 16%,287 this area of research has broad implications for a wide range of perovskite optoelectronics.
4.4 Additive roles with different fabrication techniques
Most experiments discussed in this review used spin-coated perovskite films as the basis for the studies. However, as the field of perovskites continues to mature, more scalable deposition techniques (e.g., roll-to-roll processes such as slot-die or doctor blading) will be necessary to optimize to commercialize perovskite-based devices. The film formation processes in these scalable techniques generally occur on a longer timescale than occurs in spin-coating, and so additives found to be optimal for spin-coating might not be translatable. Early work incorporating various additives via slot-die printing has been promising and devices over 20% have been fabricated.301–303 Further work in understanding the balance between the rate of crystallization with additives and the rate of drying of the solvents is necessary for more reproducible outcomes with disparate deposition techniques and perovskite compositions to facilitate the upscaling of perovskite film production.
4.5 Mechanical properties of perovskites incorporating additives
One of the key advantages of perovskite-based devices over other more mature optoelectronic technologies such as silicon is that perovskites are printable, making them amenable to roll-to-roll processing on flexible substrates. The mechanical properties of flexible devices are important considerations as these devices are more frequently subjected to more aggressive mechanical stresses than their rigid counterparts, both in fabrication and operation. Unfortunately, perovskites are brittle, ionic materials with mechanical properties not dissimilar from table salt; previous studies have highlighted the instability of perovskites subjected to mechanical stresses.41,42,304–306 It is reasonable to assume that adding compliant carbon content into the perovskite—as would be the case with the addition of organic additives—should increase the mechanical resilience; however, there is a dearth of studies on the effects of additives on the mechanical properties of perovskites.138,217 The initial studies are promising, though, and indicate that there might be some benefit of additives to the mechanical resilience of perovskite devices. Polymers are perhaps the more interesting route to explore in this case since they traditionally are less brittle and more compliant than similar small molecules.
4.6 Standardization of stability testing
As the field of perovskite electronics matures, an emphasis has been placed on improving device stability. Many of the experiments cited in this review have studied the environmental resilience of devices incorporating additives, but the conditions used varied significantly. Recently, a general consensus statement for stability assessment of perovskite photovoltaics has been published.307 This statement recommended testing conditions and possible figures of merit by which to compare the stability of devices from different reports. Most of these conditions are related to chemical and thermal stability, but ignore the mechanical stability of devices—a critical factor for flexible devices which undergo bending during fabrication and use, and large modules which experience large shear stresses that scale with size.308 We believe it is worth revisiting some of the more promising additives with a systematic approach to develop more generalizable conclusions about relative stability enhancements produced by different additives. In addition to the chemical and thermal stability tests suggested by the consensus statement, we believe that mechanical testing criteria should also be developed. If bending tests are performed, it is not sufficient to report the radius of curvature. The radius of curvature is only one part of the equation to calculate the strain applied to a thin film undergoing bending.309 Dimensions of the stack, such as device thickness and, if the film of interest is covered by other layers, the thickness of these covering layers must be described before strain can be calculated.310 For module scale devices, the relative ability to handle shear stresses is important to understand. Shear stresses can lead to adhesive or cohesive failure and the resistance to failure under these stresses can be determined by measuring the cohesive fracture energy (Gc) of films and devices, with a higher Gc being desirable.54,308
5. Conclusions and outlook
The great potential of metal halide perovskite-based electronics has thus far been unrealized due to poor material stability that limits the viability of devices outside of the laboratory. Additive engineering is a promising approach to mitigate the negative effects of surface defects in perovskite films, addressing one of the most significant hurdles to the commercialization of perovskite-based technologies. This review described the crystallization process of perovskites, the effects of defects formed during crystallization on performance and stability, and how the chemical and structural properties of organic additives can be used to influence the growth, performance, and stability of metal halide perovskite films. We also highlighted areas of research that we believe are ripe for further exploration.
In general, organic additives interact with perovskite precursors and films by Lewis acid–base interactions or hydrogen bonding. These additive–perovskite interactions simultaneously improve device efficiencies and stabilities in perovskite optoelectronics by regulating crystallization kinetics, to inhibit the formation of trap states, and passivating trap states that do form. Crystallization is regulated by the formation of intermediate adducts when additives coordinate with perovskite precursors; the formation of these intermediate phases accelerate nucleation and control the rate of crystal growth, resulting in perovskite films with less defects and typically larger grain sizes. In films, these additives quench undercoordinated bonds at grain boundaries and interfaces to passivate defect sites, reducing nonradiative recombination which improves both efficiency and stability.
Differences in the molecular structure of additives play large roles in crystallization kinetics, grain size and orientation, charge transport, as well as the performance, stability, and mechanical properties of devices. For example, the functional groups on the additives have varying interaction strengths with the perovskite precursors dependent on solution composition. Additive molecular size can also result in different film behavior; while small molecules are the most commonly studied additives, polymeric additives have similar passivating mechanisms and can also enhance film toughness. Additives which exhibit greater molecular rigidity can drive perovskite grains to preferential vertical alignment, while molecular conjugation can improve charge transport throughout the films. Moreover, many of the organic additives studied are multifunctional, which can bridge grains to improve chemical and mechanical stability; however, differentiation of the interaction strength of different functional groups with the perovskite defect sites needs to be better understood.
As discussed in this review, many organic additives positively influence perovskite-based device performance and stability. However, the role these additives play in crystallization and passivation mechanisms is still not fully understood due to the complex chemistries of the various compositions. Elucidating these complex mechanisms is a necessary step towards better selection of additives for specific perovskite properties, rather than the commonly utilized try-and-see approach.
Some design considerations are clear from the literature. Lewis bases interact with undercoordinated Pb2+ (or other metal sites) to passivate dangling bonds and reduce defect states; likewise, Lewis acids perform a similar function with antisite defects. The strength of interactions is composition dependent; for example, S-donors seem to preferentially interact with Pb2+ in solution over O-donors. Furthermore, the selected cation can change the effectiveness of the additive (e.g., DMSO interacts well with methylammonium but poorly with formamidinium). These chemistries are exceptionally complex and the role of donor strengths with different perovskite compositions is an area for further exploration. There are intriguing predictive measures of solution stability—e.g., Gutmann's donor number, with higher values favoring stable solutions and lower values favoring single crystal formation—but it is not clear how solution stability translates to film quality. It is conceivable that a solution that typically favors single crystal formation could result in high-quality films with large grains if used to print films while fresh. These questions become even more complex with multiple solvent/additive systems in which interaction strengths and volatility must be balanced with relative concentrations and processing conditions to deliver the highest film quality. Given the vast landscape of possible combinations, more predictive models must be developed to conserve resources and research efforts.
Low-dimensional perovskites add even higher demands to the additive characteristics. Improving charge transport between crystals—by reduction of crystal spacing or inclusion of semiconducting additives—is necessary for performance improvements, as is reduction of Pb–I–Pb bond distortions. Additives which direct the orientation of crystallites in a vertical direction are desirable in photovoltaic applications since this orientation provides an avenue for charges to travel directly through the perovskite to transport layers, bypassing the additive capping layers and intercrystalline hopping which are deleterious to charge carrier mobility. However, while several additives can be used to drive vertical orientation of perovskite, there is not currently a generalizable strategy for achieving this result. Recent reports also suggest that intelligent selection of additives can be used to control the phase-purity of low dimensional perovskites, allowing better control over device band gaps, which has applications in perovskite LEDs and tandem photovoltaics.
Although there is a significant body of literature related to organic additives for metal halide perovskites, there are still many important questions to be addressed. It is our hope that this review provided insight and inspiration for new research directions into the selection and design for organic additives for high-performance and stable perovskites solar cells.

 	Fig. 16  PEG-infused perovskite solar cells. (a) Schematic diagram of a PSC with an incorporated PEG-scaffold and (b) fabrication process of the perovskite film via spin-coating of a single solution incorporating the perovskite precursors and PEG. (c) J–V curves as a function of PEG molecular weight; devices were fabricated with the PEG at a concentration of 20 mg mL−1 in the precursor solution. (d) PCE distribution of perovskite solar cells as a function of 20 kDa PEG concentration in solution. The best performing devices incorporated 20 mg mL−1 of PEG in the solution. (e) PCE evolution as a function of time of unencapsulated PSCs aged in a high humidity (70% relative humidity) dark environment. (f) Photographs of perovskite films showing the color evolution of being sprayed with water for 60 s and then sitting in ambient air in 45 s. Films without PEG converted to yellow PbI2, while films incorporating PEG recovered their original color after ambient air exposure, indicating conversion from PbI2 back to perovskite. (g) Schematic representation of the mechanisms of self-healing in perovskite films incorporating PEG scaffolds. The water is absorbed onto the perovskite, which then converts to PbI2 and MAI. The PEG prevents MAI egress and allows formation of perovskite again once the water evaporates by the following steps: (1) water absorbs onto the perovskite; (2) perovskite hydrolyzes into PbI2 and MAI·H2O; and (3) MAI restrained by PEG reacts with nearby PbI2 to form perovskite again after water evaporates.
