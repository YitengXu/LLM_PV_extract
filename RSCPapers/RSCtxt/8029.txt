    , Accepted 28th November 2017First published on 28th November 2017AbstractIn the present work we used some crystallization trends which could be classified as a Crystal Engineering (CE) approach, for deposition of a pure cubic-phase thin film of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) on the surface of a mesoporous TiO2 layer. Accordingly, by using the CE approach, we fabricated high efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and perovskite solar modules (PSMs) utilizing several Hole Transport Layers (HTLs). We optimized the sequential deposition method, developing the entire realization procedure in air. The results show that the CE approach remarkably improved the device performance reaching a power conversion efficiency of 17%, 16.8% and 7% for spiro-OMeTAD, P3HT and HTL free (direct contact of the perovskite layer with the gold layer) PSCs, respectively. Furthermore, perovskite solar modules (active area of 10.1 cm2), which are fabricated by the CE approach, could reach an overall efficiency of 13% and 12.1% by using spiro-OMeTAD and P3HT as HTLs, respectively. The sealed modules showed promising results in terms of stability maintaining 70% of the initial efficiency after 350 hours of light soaking at the maximum power point.
Introduction
Owing to good optical/electrical properties, organometal-halide perovskites (PSKs) are the most promising materials for solution-processed optoelectronic devices such as solar cells, photodetectors, light emitting diodes and lasers.1–4 As a flagship of this revolution, Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs) obtain a remarkable increase of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) leading to a certified efficiency of 22.1%.5 The feasibility of solution-processing for PSCs opens up a way to the development of several deposition methods6,7 (spin-coating, blade coating, ink-jet coating, slot die coating, etc.) and device architectures (planar and mesoscopic). Usually, the best PSC performances are obtained by using one-step deposition based on solvent quenching methods and mesoscopic architectures.8 However, the uncontrolled precipitation of the perovskite produces large morphological variations, resulting in a wide spread of photovoltaic performance in the devices, which limits scaling-up efforts for practical application of this technology.9 Moreover, solvent quenching methods require a controlled environment. The anti-solvent induces oversaturation of the perovskite solution and it is usually dripped at the center of the film during spin-coating. This results in a radial oversaturation gradient and consequently a spatially inhomogeneous nucleation of the perovskite (or its intermediates) forms, leading to defects in the film.10,11 Moreover, the anti-solvents are typically toxic and harmful to the environment, hampering their large-scale application.12,13 For these reasons, a sequential deposition was introduced to realize reproducible and efficient PSCs by using a mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2) layer to enhance the perovskite formation.9 It has been successfully applied to large area devices14 up to a module with an active area exceeding 100 and 50 cm2 and having efficiencies of 9.03% (ref. 15) and 12.6%,16 respectively.
For the sequential method, the PbI2 layer is first deposited, followed by conversion to the perovskite in MAI solution.9 Since the deposition processes of the PbI2 layer are simple and versatile, a uniform and full coverage PbI2 layer can be easily obtained, improving the quality of the perovskite layer. The first successful work on the sequential method for PSCs was reported by Burschka et al. in 2013, who obtained a PCE of 15%.9 Soon after, many studies were conducted on the sequential method due to its high operability and good performance reproducibility. Most importantly, the great progress in the reaction/growth mechanism of the sequential method resulted in the development of optimized processes, which well improved the perovskite quality and enhanced the device performance. Typically, by combining the second spin-coating step with optimized MAI concentrations, the perovskite grain size can be tuned to absorb most of the visible light with minimum recombination loss, promoting the PCE over 16%.17 Then, a novel interdiffusion strategy based on a sequential spin-coating process further improved the perovskite quality and enhanced the PCE to about 19%.18 Recently, by applying a new Pb–I precursor of PbI2(DMSO), a high-quality FAPbI3/MAPbBr3 perovskite was obtained through intramolecular exchange between FA/MA and DMSO, which boosted the PCE to over 20%.19 Therefore, the sequential method has been well proved to be an effective approach to fabricate high-performance PSCs.
Compared to the solvent quenching approaches, the sequential deposition, however, suffers from the formation of a metastable yellow intermediate perovskite phase and irregular phase distribution.20 For this reason, we focus our study on the crystallization properties of the perovskite during the deposition in order to relate crystal growth strategies to the photovoltaic performance of devices.
Among different PSKs, CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) properly fits with the sequential deposition on the mp-TiO2 layer, showing amazing ambipolar properties with different crystalline phases. There are several reports showing state-of-the-art PSCs using the MAPbI3 structure in contact with various scaffolds and HTM layers.9,17,21–25 Furthermore, Xiao and co-workers fabricated HTM-free devices of MAPbI3-based PSCs by in situ formation of perovskite layers and achieved PCEs from 9.03% to 10.03%.23,24 In addition they fabricated Ti foil based light-weight perovskite solar cells with an active area of 1.00 cm2 yielding an efficiency of 13.07%.25 In particular, the conductivity of MAPbI3 can be tuned from p-type to n-type by modifying the growth conditions.26 In addition, a high crystallinity and a large crystal grain of the perovskite film can reduce crystal defects, improving the carrier mobility and decreasing the electron–hole recombination.27 Therefore, the optimization of the crystallization process is crucial to increase the photovoltaic performance of this class of materials. According to the bulk single crystal analysis of MAPbI3, there are three crystal structures: orthorhombic, tetragonal and cubic.28–30 The orthorhombic–tetragonal phase transitions occur at 162.2 K, while the tetragonal–cubic transitions at 327.4 K.28 Since the methyl ammonium ion CH3NH3+ (MA+) has a low symmetry (C3v), the orientation of the MA+ ion should be disordered to satisfy the Oh symmetry.30 Room temperature neutron diffraction experiments31 for a tetragonal crystal structure of MAPbI3 reveal that the protonated amine substituent (–NH3+) of MA+ is disordered in four positions which are preferentially located near the neighbouring iodine of [PbI6] octahedra, while the methyl substituent (–CH3) is disordered in eight positions located near the body site of the unit cell. Furthermore, high temperature experiments show a cubic structure where the cation aligns along the [011] (edge), the [111] (diagonal), and the [100] (face) directions of the unit cell.31 Formation of hydrogen bonds between the protonated amine of MA+ and the iodine atom of [PbI6] octahedra plays an important role in stabilization or transition of different phases.31 Calculations using van der Waals-corrected density functional theory show that the orientation of the organic molecules plays a fundamental role in determining the material electronic properties.29 Moreover, Dong et al. suggested that photoexcitation leads to the weakening of the hydrogen bonds, connecting the organic to the inorganic parts of MAPbI3.32 Such bond weakening also favours the perovskite–water interaction leading to the perovskite degradation.32
According to inorganic synthesis concepts for the [PbI6] octahedral complex, nucleation and crystal growth of the MAPbI3 layer in MAI solution is by means of the thermodynamic and kinetic control of the ligand exchange reaction.33 In general, the ligand exchange reaction could occur by two main mechanisms namely associative ligand substitution (SN2) and dissociative ligand substitution (SN1).34 However, dissociative ligand substitution is most favoured in coordinatively saturated 18e− complexes such as tetrahedral and octahedral. In the SN1 mechanism, the M–X bond is fully broken before the M–Nucleophile (M–Nu) bond is formed thereby avoiding an energetically unfavourable 20e− intermediate. Kinetically, the rate-determining step in a SN1 pathway is the breaking of the M–L bond and formation of a trigonal bipyramid in the transition step of the reaction.35 Thus kinetics of the MAPbI3 nucleation reaction is more sensitive to the concentration of [PbI6]. Owing to molecular orbital (MO) theory, the conduction bands of MAPbI3 are mainly derived from the empty Pb p orbitals. Due to the ionic characteristics of MAPbI3, the covalent anti bonding coupling between Pb p and I p is not strong. Therefore, the conduction band minimum (CBM) should not be much higher than the atomic Pb p states.36 The valence band of MAPbI3 is mainly derived from I p states with small components of Pb s states. Because of the strong Pb s–I p antibonding coupling, the valence band maximum (VBM) is above the I p atomic orbital level.36
Crystal growth of perovskites is also determined by the solvent. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of PbI2 crystal growth in dimethylformamide (DMF) solution revealed that one DMF molecule is coordinated to the Pb and formed a one-dimensional structure of PbI2·DMF along the a axis.37
Besides the intrinsic crystallization properties of MAPbI3, the film crystal structure is highly related to the underlying layers.38 In particular, for mesoscopic PSCs fabricated by these sequential methods, the final morphology of the PbI2 film will depend on the mp-TiO2 layer which, in turn, will impact the nucleation of the final perovskite layer. In the first step of the sequential deposition, the first nuclei start to grow on the activated sites of the mp-TiO2 surface. Accordingly, the kinetics of the PbI2 crystallization is controlled by the active nucleation sites of the mp-TiO2 surface.
The discussions presented in the previous paragraphs show the importance of the MAPbI3 crystallization process. There are some studies about the formation of MAPbI3 single crystals under bulk conditions.28–30 However, MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells still suffer from the polycrystalline structure of thin film layers. Therefore, the definition of the strategy for the formation of pure-phase single crystals in thin film devices is a challenging aspect for the enhancement of both the efficiency and stability of PSCs. Dong et al. reported some advantages of solution-grown MAPbI3 single crystals.39 They have shown that the diffusion length in MAPbI3 single crystals can exceed 175 μm under 1 SUN illumination conditions for both electrons and holes.39 These long diffusion lengths result from greater carrier mobility, longer lifetime, and much smaller trap densities in the single crystals with respect to the polycrystalline thin films. Furthermore, the red-shift of the EQE cut-off by 50 nm (to 850 nm) observed in single crystals increases the upper limit of short-circuit current density (Jsc) in MAPbI3-based solar cells from 27.5 mA cm−2 to 33.0 mA cm−2.39 Therefore using a new approach for the formation of a single crystalline state of MAPbI3 perovskite in thin film layers is highly needed.
In the present work, we performed an optimized deposition technique, hereafter called the Crystal Engineering (CE) approach. The CE permitted the formation of a pure crystalline MAPbI3 perovskite film by using sequential deposition entirely realized in air. In addition, we fabricated PSCs with an ordinary sequential deposition method,9 which is hereafter called the “OM”. Scaling up of the CE technique passing from small devices to series-connected modules is also demonstrated. The design of the molecular solids with CE concerns the synthesis of functional solid-state structures from neutral or ionic building blocks, using intermolecular interactions in the design strategy. Hydrogen bonds, coordination bonds, and other less directed interactions define substructural patterns, referred to in the literature as supramolecular synthons and secondary building units.40 Indeed, we could improve the crystalline parameters of the MAPbI3 perovskite thin film by using classical single crystal growth methods. In the first step, we controlled nucleation and crystal growth of the PbI2 layer by using an annealing procedure for pre-activation of the mp-TiO2 surface and slow evaporation of DMF solvent. In the second step, we increased the rate of MAPbI3 perovskite nucleation, controlled the crystal growth by the solvent-assisted ligand exchange reaction and designed a specific annealing program. Both CE and OM perovskite deposition techniques are used to fabricate PSCs with two different Hole Transporting Materials (HTMs), namely spiro-OMeTAD and P3HT and even without HTM (HTM-free).
In all the experiments, photovoltaic performances of cells and modules fabricated by the CE approach are promisingly enhanced compared to that of the conventional sequential fabrication method of MAPbI3-based PSCs.9 It is worth noting that the stability of the modules fabricated with the CE approach shows remarkable results.
Experimental
Titania layer deposition
A raster scanning laser (Nd:YVO4 pulsed at 30 kHz average output power P = 10 W) was used to pattern the FTO/glass substrates (Pilkington, 15 Ω cm−1, 25 mm × 25 mm and 570 mm × 570 mm for small devices and modules, respectively). The patterned substrates were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath, using detergent diluted in de-ionized water, de-ionized water and ethanol (10 minutes for each step), respectively. A compact TiO2 (c-TiO2) layer was deposited onto the patterned FTO by spray pyrolysis deposition using a previously reported procedure.21 Briefly, the substrate temperature was fixed at 450 °C, the distance between the substrate positioned flat and the aerograph (tilted about 45° with respect to the substrate) was fixed to 20 cm. The number of successive spray cycles was about 10 and the final thickness was 40 nm. The precursor spray solution consisted of 0.16 M diisopropoxytitanium bis(acetylacetonate) (TAA) and 0.4 M acetylacetone (ACAC) in ethanol. Patterning of the c-TiO2 was achieved by using a screen printed metal mask which was removed after the c-TiO2 deposition, utilizing an acidic solution, de-ionized water and ethanol. A nanocrystalline mesoporous TiO2 layer (18NR-Tpaste, Dyesol), diluted with ethanol, a ratio of 1:6 (w/w) for small area devices and 1:5 (w/w) for modules, was spin coated onto the c-TiO2 surface, at 1500 rpm for 20 s, and then sintered using an annealing program from room temperature to 120 °C for 5 min and maintained for 5 min, 120 °C to 325 °C for 15 min and maintained for 5 min, 325 °C to 375 °C for 5 min and maintained for 5 min, 375 °C to 480 °C for 5 min and maintained for 30 min. To measure the final thickness of the mp-TiO2 a Dektak-Veeco 150 profilometer was used and the values were determined to be 180 ± 20 nm. The mentioned deposition route of c-TiO2 and mp-TiO2 layers has been done for both small area and module size devices.
Perovskite layer deposition

Ordinary sequential deposition method (OM). 
The lead iodide solution (PbI2 in N,N-dimethylformamide, 460 mg ml−1, 1 M) was deposited on the substrate by spin coating at 6000 rpm for 10 s, while the temperature of the solution was set to 70 °C, then the substrates were dried at 70 °C for 10 min.
CH3NH3PbI3 crystallization was achieved by dipping the PbI2 layers in a methylammonium iodide solution (CH3NH3I in anhydrous 2-propanol 10 mg ml−1) for 10 minutes, washing immediately with 2-propanol by spin coating at 6000 rpm with an acceleration rate of 6000 for 10 s and dried at 115 °C for 10 min.


Crystal engineering approach (CE). 
In order to achieve a proper crystal engineering of the PbI2 layer, a supersaturated solution of PbI2 in DMF which was prepared by dissolving 535 mg and 500 mg of PbI2 in 1 ml of DMF for small devices and modules, respectively, was deposited by spin coating at 6000 rpm for 10 s, while the temperature of the solution was set to 70 °C, on the surface of the preheated (70 °C) mp-TiO2 layer. The relative concentration of PbI2 in DMF is strongly related to the size of the substrate. In fact, the typical concentration of PbI2 used for a small area cell (535 mg ml−1) will produce a very inhomogeneous layer if to be used for large substrates. For this reason, when scaling up the CE procedure to module size we use a concentration of 500 mg ml−1. To achieve slow surface evaporation, the small area devices were annealed from room temperature to 40 °C in 1 min, maintained at this temperature for 2 min, raised the temperature to 60 °C in 1 min and remained at this temperature for 1 min more. The Perovskite solar modules were annealed from room temperature to 50 °C in 2 min, maintained at 50 °C for 2 min, raised the temperature from 50 °C to 70 °C in 1 min and maintained at this temperature for 1 min.
In the second step, the prepared cooled PbI2·DMF layers were dipped in a solution of methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I in anhydrous 2-propanol, 10 mg ml−1) for 1, 2, 10 and 30 min at room temperature while the solution was kept under mechanical stirring during the dipping time. Then the devices were washed immediately with 2-propanol by spin coating at 6000 rpm with an acceleration rate of 6000 for 10 s. Finally, the devices were annealed from room temperature to 70 °C in 1 min, maintained at 70 °C for 2 min, increased the temperature from 70 °C to 115 °C in 3 min and maintained for 4 min at this temperature.

Hole transport layers and counter electrode deposition
HTLs were deposited by spin-coating 73.2 mg ml−1 solution of 2,20,7,70-tetrakis-(N,N-dip-methoxyphenylamine)9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) or 0.16 mM solution of poly(3-hexylthiphene) (P3HT) with 124 kDa molecular weight in chlorobenzene (the P3HT solutions are heated at 55 °C to prevent any gel formation process21). The spiro-OMeTAD was deposited by spin coating at 2000 rpm for 20 s with an acceleration rate of 2000. The P3HT was deposited by spin coating at 2500 rpm for 45 s with an acceleration rate of 2500. The spiro-OMeTAD and P3HT precursors were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and Merck companies, respectively. The P3HT solution was doped with 11.4 μl of tert-butylpyridine (TBP) and 12 μl of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) solution (520 mg in 1 ml of acetonitrile). Furthermore, spiro-OMeTAD solution was doped with 26.8 μl of tert-butylpyridine (TBP), 16.6 μl of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) solution (520 mg in 1 ml of acetonitrile) and 7.2 μl of cobalt 209 (stock solution 375 mg in 1 ml acetonitrile).
Finally, the prepared samples were introduced into a high vacuum chamber (10−6 mbar) to thermally evaporate Au back contacts (thickness 80 nm). In the present work the deposition of all layers, except gold, was performed under air conditions. Furthermore, HTM-free devices were fabricated through the deposition of the gold layer on the surface of the perovskite layer. The batches of 33, 24 and 11 devices using spiro-OMeTAD, P3HT and without the HTL for small area devices were evaluated, respectively.
Device measurement and evaluation
Masked devices were tested using a solar simulator (ABET Sun 2000, class A) under AM1.5G and 100 mW cm−2 illumination conditions calibrated with a certified reference Si Cell (RERA Solutions RR-1002). Incident power was measured with a Skye SKS 1110 sensor. PSC measurements were performed following the suggestion given in reference articles.41,42 The absorbance was measured with a BLACK-Comet UV-VIS Spectrometer. The morphology and grain size of the PbI2 and perovskite layers are obtained by Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM ZEISS and CNIS). Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed under dark conditions at room temperature using an Autolab 302N Modular Potentiostat from Metrohm in the two-electrode configuration with a bias voltage ranging from 0.6 to 1 V. The sinewave ac perturbation used was of 10 mV amplitude with frequencies from 1 MHz to 1 Hz.
Results and discussion
Crystal engineering approach
For thermodynamic equilibrium growth conditions of MAPbI3, the chemical potentials are constrained to ranges that promote the growth of MAPbI3 and exclude the formation of secondary phases such as PbI2 and CH3NH3I.43 The thermodynamic stable range for the equilibrium growth of CH3NH3PbI3 is schematically drawn by Yin et al. using the chemical potentials of components, which show a narrow but long chemical range.39 Outside this region, the compound will decompose into PbI2 and CH3NH3I. This indicates that the growth conditions should be carefully controlled to form the desirable MAPbI3 perovskite phase. Since these materials typically crystallize from their precursor salt solutions, the favoured structure is often dictated by the kinetics of crystallization. The latter is then controlled by several parameters such as temperature, pressure and pH.44 Accordingly, we managed the formation of the perovskite layer by introducing a Crystal Engineering (CE) approach to achieve a well desirable MAPbI3 phase.
Our CE approach is divided into three main steps (see Fig. 1): (I) pre-activation of the mp-TiO2 surface to increase the active nucleation sites. (II) Slow evaporation, a well-known technique for single crystal growth,45 is performed first by spin coating of a supersaturated PbI2 solution in DMF and after using a well-defined annealing program. (III) Solvent-assisted SN1 perovskite formation, is achieved by dipping the PbI2·DMF layer in the diluted solution of MAI in 2-propanol to form a pure cubic structure of the MAPbI3 perovskite. The conversion process in the sequential perovskite deposition is a typical heterogeneous phase reaction between the solid PbI2 layer and MAI solution, with intercalation of MAI molecules into layered PbI2 crystals. Hence, the morphology of the final MAPbI3 layer is significantly determined by that of the PbI2 layer.46
 Fig. 1  (a) Solvent assisted SN1 ligand exchange reaction mechanism. The labeled terms in the dipping time can be described as (1) dissociation of the DMF ligand from octahedra and formation of a square pyramid structure (rate determining step of the reaction), (2) rearrangement of the square pyramid to a triangular bipyramid structure and (3) association of MAI with I− in the axial position of Pb coordination and MA+ in the surrounding octahedral sites of the perovskite structure using hydrogen bonding. (b) A schematic which represents the procedure of the CE approach for the fabrication of the pure cubic MAPbI3 perovskite layer in sequential spin coating deposition. 

Pre-activation. 
Pre-activation is needed to solve two main problems related to the OM, namely the formation of large and dense PbI2 crystals and the presence of different perovskite crystal phases in PbI2 and perovskite layers. Owing to the crystallization reaction kinetics, during the dipping in the MAI solution, a dense PbI2 layer with large particles leads to an increased rate of perovskite crystal growth instead of a nucleation process. This will lead to an uncontrolled crystal growth with lower amounts of MAPbI3 nuclei, formation of large MAPbI3 crystals on the top layers and the unconverted PbI2 phase in the deep layers.46–48 For the OM, the polycrystalline perovskite thin film is formed from a composition of cubic, tetragonal and room temperature metastable PbI2–MAI–DMF intermediate phases.20 The intermediate phase appears in the perovskite film which is annealed in the temperature range between 40 and 80 °C. This implies that the intermediate phase is both thermodynamically and kinetically metastable.
Pre-activation of the mp-TiO2 surface could be achieved by different methods to increase the chemisorption properties.49,50 In the CE approach, mp-TiO2 surface pre-activation permits the increase of the amounts of PbI2·DMF nuclei by reducing the activation energy of Ti–O–Pb bonding,51,52 which facilitates the primary nucleation process.


Slow-evaporation. 
We prepared a supersaturated solution of PbI2 in DMF solvent to promote secondary nucleation processes. After the deposition of supersaturated PbI2 solution on the pre-activated mp-TiO2 surface, a well-defined annealing program (see the Experimental section) is applied for slow evaporation of the excess DMF from the surface layer. This results in the formation of a porous PbI2·DMF layer which facilitates the infiltration of MAI into the PbI2·DMF layer. The fast nucleation process permits the growth of many small nanocrystals of PbI2·DMF on the entire substrate and the slow evaporation method leads to a pure nanoporous thin-film crystal layer of PbI2·DMF. Slow evaporation is required for the crystallization of PbI2·DMF with the insertion of DMF molecules, as an axial ligand of a Pb coordination sphere. If fast evaporation occurs, unwanted PbI2 or other complexes without the DMF ligand will be formed.37


Solvent assisted SN1 ligand-exchange reaction mechanism. 
The chemical structure of the PbI2·DMF layer contains the [PbI5(DMF)] octahedral complex with axial bonding of DMF molecules. During the dipping time in MAI solution, owing to the dissociative nature of the octahedral complex ligand exchange reaction, the rate of the reaction is mainly controlled by the concentration of [PbI5(DMF)]. Considering the SN1 mechanism of the perovskite formation, breaking of the Pb–O bonding between lead and DMF is the rate determining step of the reaction kinetics. The weak bonding of Pb–O could easily break and enhance the rate of perovskite nucleation. Furthermore, the DMF molecule as a polar solvent could facilitate the reaction by remaining in the coordination sphere and stabilize the triangular bipyramid structure of the SN1 intermediate structure.


Film characterization. 
The difference of the film morphology between OM and CE fabrication methods is evaluated by using a Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) technique. As presented in Fig. 2a–d, there is an obvious difference between the OM and CE deposition techniques with regard to the surface morphology, PbI2 particle size and perovskite layer. The OM-fabricated PbI2 layer shows a smooth and dense morphology while CE presents a nanoporous morphology of PbI2·DMF nanocrystals. This nanoporous PbI2 structure leads to better diffusion of the MAI solution into the pores, permitting higher perovskite nucleation in the entire PbI2 layer.19,53 In fact, for the OM, unreacted PbI2 inevitably coexists with the perovskite crystals leading to a reduction of the absorbance properties of the MAPbI3 layer and to a high resistance due to the insulating nature of PbI2.47 Besides the nanoporous structure, the SEM images of the perovskite layer show large differences in crystal sizes and shape between the two crystallization methods. The OM and CE show perovskite crystal sizes of around 100 nm and 200–300 nm, respectively. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) measurements of both PbI2 and perovskite layers are performed to further investigate the crystalline structures (Fig. 2e). The typical peaks of the PbI2 layer fabricated by CE are in good agreement with the diffraction pattern of single crystalline state PbI2·DMF.37 The main differences in the XRD pattern between OM and CE are related to the perovskite layers. The OM-MAPbI3 layer shows diffraction patterns that correspond to the typical tetragonal perovskite structures54,55 while CE MAPbI3 is in the pure cubic phase,31 which corresponds to those extracted from single crystal neutron diffraction structural studies. Furthermore, CE MAPbI3 does not show any diffraction peak for the intermediate metastable perovskite phase20 and PbI2·DMF precursor, which prove the complete conversion of the PbI2·DMF layer into the cubic perovskite phase. By using crystallography information files (CIF) of PbI2·DMF,37 cubic54 and tetragonal55 MAPbI3 perovskite phases, we evaluated the unit cell ellipsoid structure and Bravais, Friedel, Donnay and Harker (BFDH) crystal morphology prediction, which are presented in Fig. 3. The formation of a Pb–O coordination bond implies the possibility of attractive interactions between Pb and oxygen on the surface of the mp-TiO2.

All the figures are evaluated by using Mercury CSD 3.8 (Build RC2) under the copyright of CCDC from crystallography information files (CIF) of PbI2·DMF, cubic and tetragonal MAPbI3 perovskite phases. 
The difference between OM and CE is also evidenced in the absorption spectra reported in Fig. 2f. Here, an evident improvement of the perovskite absorbance between 400 and 800 nm for CE with respect to OM is clearly shown. Higher absorbance suggests a higher light harvesting of the CE perovskite as demonstrated in IPCE measurements (see the following). The improved charge injection capability of CE with respect to the OM is demonstrated with the PL of MAPbI3/mp-TiO2 films. As reported in Fig. 2f, the PL emission peak that appeared in the 700–850 nm range corresponds to the band gap of MAPbI3. The PL intensity decreases significantly for samples fabricated by the CE method compared to the OM. Reduced PL intensity is mainly related to better electron injection into the mesoporous TiO2. This is well consistent with the interfacial morphology as confirmed by the FIB-SEM results of Ko et al.56 In addition, the pure cubic phase of the CE perovskite layer leads to better diffusion of the photoinduced charge carrier inside the perovskite thin film.57 The results of PL and absorbance are in good agreement as shown in Fig. 2f. Furthermore, the band gap energy of the CE perovskite layer is evaluated to be 1.55 eV by the transformation of the diffuse-reflectance spectrum in the Kubelka–Munk equation which is in good agreement with the MAPbI3 band gap energy (see Fig. S1†).58

Small area perovskite solar cells
PSCs are fabricated with both OM and CE approaches. We considered several HTLs (spiro-OMeTAD and P3HT) and HTL-free where the gold counter-electrode is directly evaporated onto the perovskite layer.
The statistical distribution of PCE and average photovoltaic (PV) parameters are presented in Fig. 4 and S2,† respectively. The J–V characteristics of representative devices fabricated by CE are shown in Fig. S6.† Evaluation of standard deviation values is reported in Table S1.† Furthermore, statistical values of PV parameters for all the PSCs with different HTLs are presented separately in Fig. S3–S5,†Table 1 and Fig. S5.† The J–V curves of champion devices in both forward and reverse voltage sweeps are also shown in Fig. S7.† A PCE comparison table for the recent state-of-the-art PSCs is also presented in the ESI (Table S2†).

The comparison between PSCs shows that for each class of PV of HTLs, performances are significantly improved by replacing the OM approach with CE. Concerning spiro-based devices, the PCE is enhanced from the average values of 12.00 ± 0.70% for OM-PSCs to 16.64 ± 0.38% for CE-PSCs. Similarly, the average PCE values of the P3HT-based and HTL free devices are improved from 9.38 ± 0.63% to 15.11 ± 1.33% and from 3.32 ± 0.86% to 6.65 ± 0.33%, respectively. Moreover, by applying the CE approach, we are able to realize high efficiency PSCs utilizing spiro-OMeTAD, P3HT and HTL free with PCE values of 17.04%, 16.81% and 6.96%, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. S6†). We should notice that the PCE values, especially those for P3HT-based devices, can be considered as having record efficiency among those reported in the literature for MAPbI3-based PSCs with the same cell architecture.59 The CE approach leads to an improvement of photovoltaic parameters, especially open-circuit voltage (Voc) and short-circuit current density (Jsc), in comparison with the OM. The improved Jsc is related to better charge collection, lower surface recombination and improvement of the charge carrier injection efficiency, as confirmed by transient-dynamic measurements (see the following).
The External Quantum Efficiency (EQE) spectra of the selected PSCs are shown in Fig. 5. EQE integrated current density values are in good agreement with Jsc values obtained from J–V curves. For both spiro-OMeTAD and P3HT based PSCs, the EQE values between 350 and 800 nm are reasonably increased when moving from the OM to CE. This is partially true for the HTM-free PSC, where the enhancement is only observed between 500 nm and 800 nm while for smaller wavelength, the OM produces a larger EQE with respect to CE. The EQE is the product of charge injection and collection and light harvesting efficiencies. The improvement of light harvesting and injection efficiencies has already been confirmed with absorbance and PL measurements reported for the MAPbI3/mp-TiO2 layers in Fig. 2f. The collection efficiency is also improved as demonstrated by steady state and dynamic tests, reported in Fig. 5. In particular, these tests showed the decrease of surface recombination centres and the improvement of the charge injection from perovskites to mp-TiO2, demonstrating a well-matched interface with lower surface recombination. This could be attributed to a better formation of the perovskite layer, as confirmed by PL measurements. Lin et al. determined how the short-circuit current varies as a function of the cell geometry and, in particular, the perovskite-junction thickness, by performing a cavity modelling (transfer-matrix analysis).60 Optical-field distribution in a CH3NH3PbI3-perovskite device for λ < 500 nm follows the Beer–Lambert law and no optical field reaches the back electrode as a result of the high absorption coefficient. In such cases, the absorption is saturated and no optical interference occurs. For λ > 500 nm the optical field is governed by low-finesse cavity interference. The EQE spectra of devices with different MAPbI3-layer thicknesses also show a minimal influence of the film thickness for λ < 500 nm while, for λ > 500 nm the EQE is strongly thickness dependent because of the optical interference. On the other hand, high EQE values imply that absorbed photons are efficiently converted to dissociated pairs of charge-carriers and these photogenerated carriers are collected at the electrodes with few losses, which can offer the possibility for further enhancement of the device efficiency by increasing the thickness of the perovskite layer.61

Fig. 5d shows the PCE of the selected devices evaluated with maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under 2 min illuminations with simulated AM1.5G sun light. Devices fabricated by using the CE approach show stabilized PCE values of 16.8%, 14.8% and 5.8% for spiro-OMeTAD, P3HT and HTL free, respectively.
Dipping time is also an important step of the CE reaction which is determined by crystal growth kinetics and thermodynamics. To identify the best dipping time, we evaluated the photovoltaic performances of the spiro-OMeTAD based devices fabricated by CE in 4 different dipping times. As presented in Fig. S8,† the highest photovoltaic performance is achieved for a dipping time of 10 min, a sufficient time to complete the crystal growth with a uniform phase and size. Yang et al. illustrated that in two step formation of the MAPbI3 layer, crystal growth is in line with a competing relationship between in situ transformation and dissolution–crystallization mechanisms, which is widely dependent on the reaction kinetics by governing the chemical coordination between Pb and I atoms.62 Owing to the proposed solvent assisted SN1 ligand exchange reaction, dissociation of the DMF molecule is considered as the rate determining step (r.d.s.) of the reaction kinetics. The presence of DMF molecules with high polarity characteristics in the coordination sphere of the PbI6 octahedra facilitates the complete conversion of the PbI2 nanoparticles into perovskite via dissolution–crystallization mechanisms in 10 min.
By increasing the dipping time two detrimental effects will compromise the efficiency of the cell as well as the value of Voc.63–65 On increasing the dipping time the residual PbI2 reduces. However, a small concentration of PbI2 (around 2%) is needed to reduce back recombination. Moreover, for a high dipping time bigger perovskite crystals are formed as a result of the thermodynamically driven Ostwald ripening process. This in turn, changes the perovskite/HTM (or perovskite/gold in the case of HTM free devices) interface compromising the functioning of the device.66
Finally, the annealing program to 115 °C not only permits the full crystallization of the surface to the grain boundaries, but also helps to remove excess DMF through evaporation. As presented in the XRD patterns (Fig. 2e), CE-based devices present a pure cubic perovskite phase, while OM-based devices show the tetragonal phase. This pure cubic structure could be responsible for higher Jsc values, observed for CE-based devices owing to their intrinsic long charge carrier diffusion.57
In order to further investigate the role of the CE approach in the charge recombination phenomena, we combined Transient Photo-Voltage decay (TPV), light intensity dependence of Voc and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements on PSCs with spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM. In particular, in the TPV decay test, the fall in photovoltage is monitored passing from an illuminated steady state (1 SUN) to the dark.67Fig. 6a shows the normalized transients of Voc over more than 5 decades of time scale. As reported in the inset, a three-exponential fitting highlights an increase in each time constant by more than one order of magnitude. Considering that the combination of high carrier mobility together with the high diffusion length of PSCs limits charge recombination at the interfaces between the perovskite layer and selective contacts,68–71 the CE approach seems to reduce the amount of recombination centers.

(a) Transient Photo-Voltage decay test from 1 SUN to dark conditions; the line represents the fitting with a three-exponential function, the extracted time constants are reported. (b) Vocversus optical incident power (Pinc) from 0.001 to 2 SUN; dashed lines are the logarithmic fitting. (c) Surface recombination times estimated from the fitting of EIS spectra under dark conditions for different voltage bias points. The inset reports the equivalent circuit used to extract R1, R2 and Cs. 
Complementary information regarding carrier recombination is extracted from the light intensity (Pinc) dependence of the Voc. Fig. 6b shows semi-logarithmic plots of the Voc ranging from 0.001 to 2 SUN (1 SUN = 100 mW cm−2). Both OM and CE approaches show similar slopes (around 155 mV dec−1) under intermediate and high levels of intensity where the Voc is mainly determined by the Fermi level of perovskites.72 Interestingly, enhancement of the slope (495 mV dec−1) is reported for PSCs with the OM under low light intensity (<0.01 SUN). The Voc trend at this irradiation level is limited by the TiO2 and the accumulation of the photo-injected electrons,72 suggesting that the CE approach results in an improved interfacial match between the perovskite and TiO2 layers.
A final confirmation of the improved interfaces between the perovskite and selective contacts by implementing the CE strategy has been obtained from EIS analysis which is performed at different potentials under dark conditions. Complex spectra were fitted with a model, recently introduced by Garcia-Belmonte et al.68 are reported in Fig. 6c. The equivalent circuit comprises a series resistance (Rs) accounting for the ohmic contribution of contacts and wires, a geometrical capacitance (Cg) for the dielectric response of the perovskite layer, a surface charge accumulation capacitance (Cs) for the interfaces and two resistive (R2 and R1) elements that mainly take into account the recombination processes. Carrier losses by surface recombination at the contact interfaces can be quantified with a characteristic time (τs = (R1 + R2)Cs). Fig. 6c shows an evident improvement of τs up to two orders of magnitude at the high voltage level. While considering the diversity of the techniques, these results are in agreement with the TPV results and corroborate the correlation between the crystallization procedures of the perovskite layer with the surface recombination that takes place at the interfaces with selective contacts. The voltage dependent Nyquist plot, resistive elements, recombination resistance, geometric capacitance and surface charge accumulation capacitance plots are presented in Fig. S9–S12.†
Large area perovskite solar modules
The CE process was scaled up to fabricate perovskite modules with both P3HT and spiro-OMeTAD HTLs. For the large area fabrication procedure, in order to avoid the formation of a skin layer73 and striation defects,74,75 we reduced the viscosity of PbI2 in DMF solution by reducing the concentration of PbI2 by 7.5% with respect to the value used for the small area. The I–V results shown in Fig. S13(a and b)† demonstrate that the CE approach is also an appropriate fabrication procedure for scaled-up devices, reaching a PCE of 13.03% and 12.1% for perovskite modules with spiro-OMeTAD and P3HT as HTLs, respectively. Based on our knowledge, the results of P3HT based modules show the highest PCE published so far in the literature. The photovoltaic parameters under reverse/forward scan directions are also listed in Table S3.† Furthermore, we performed the MPP tracking measurement under AM1.5G, 1 SUN illumination conditions for 3 min using both HTLs as reported in Fig. 7. The results demonstrate that the stabilized PCE under MPP conditions is close to the value obtained under reverse scan conditions reaching a PCE = 12.75% for spiro-OMeTAD and 11.20% for P3HT. The sharp PCE decrease in the first ten seconds of the MPPT is mainly due to the slow motion of cation vacancies in the perovskite layer that affect the charge extraction as reported by Domanski et al.76 The high stabilized PCE obtained for MAPbI3-based perovskite solar modules using spiro-OMeTAD and P3HT as HTLs, demonstrates the effectiveness of the CE method with a large active area.
 Fig. 7  Photocurrent efficiency of the modules at the maximum power point under 3 min AM1.5G illumination. 
Stability measurements of the CE module fabricated with the spiro-OMeTAD HTL, under light soaking conditions (1000 W m−2, white LED) have been performed and are reported in Fig. 8. After a PCE burn-in occurring in the first minutes, the efficiency remains quite constant, around 70% of the initial efficiency being maintained.
 Fig. 8  Light soaking analysis of the spiro based CE module. 
Fig. S14† highlights a direct correlation between the PCE burn-in and the reduction of Jsc during the first 5 hours. Interestingly, there is no burn-in of the series and shunt resistances (Fig. S14†), demonstrating that the ETL and HTL are not degraded. This permits us to correlate the burn-in to a perovskite absorber degradation. This is also confirmed by Transient Photo-Voltage analysis (TPV) reported in Fig. S15.† Here, the concentration of the photoinjected electrons in the TiO2 primarily determines the photovoltage transient profile. As reported in Fig. S15,† after the stress the device shows a slower Voc rise profile that can be associated with the degradation of the perovskite layer and its capability to inject charges into the TiO2 layer. Moreover, the performance under different light intensities shows a constant reduction (around 20–30%) of Jsc for the stressed module with respect to the fresh one (Fig. S16†). However, under low light conditions this variation of the current value reduces down to 6% suggesting a generation problem of the active layer. The picture of fabricated modules in both fresh and 7 months after the light soaking test is presented in Fig. S17.† Furthermore, the photovoltaic parameters of the CE module 7 month after the light soaking test are listed in Table S4.†
Conclusions
The main scope of this work concerns the identification, development and characterization of a new method that can facilitate scaled-up fabrication of PSCs with high overall efficiency and good stability. Accordingly, we demonstrated a novel crystallography approach, the Crystal Engineering (CE), which can be easily applied to solution-based sequential deposition, leading to a clear enhancement of overall efficiency for PSCs made with different HTMs. The CE approach relies on three main steps: (I) pre-activation of the mp-TiO2 surface to increase the active nucleation sites. (II) Slow evaporation, a well-known technique for single crystal growth,77 is performed first by spin coating a supersaturated PbI2 solution in DMF and after using a well defined annealing program. (III) Solvent-assisted SN1 perovskite formation, achieved by dipping the PbI2·DMF layer in the diluted solution of MAI in 2-propanol, to form a pure MAPbI3 cubic structure. The results show that the CE approach remarkably improved the device performance reaching a power conversion efficiency of 17%, 16.8% and 7% for spiro-OMeTAD, P3HT and HTL free (direct contact of the perovskite layer with the gold layer) PSCs, respectively. Furthermore, perovskite solar modules (active area 10.1 cm2) are also fabricated by utilizing the CE approach. The modules reach a stabilized overall efficiency of 13% and 12.1% by using spiro-OMeTAD and P3HT as HTLs, respectively. The P3HT based modules achieved the highest overall efficiency which is reported in our work for the first time. The sealed modules fabricated by the CE approach also showed promising results in terms of stability maintaining 70% of the initial efficiency after 350 hours of light soaking at the maximum power point.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Solvent assisted SN1 ligand exchange reaction mechanism. The labeled terms in the dipping time can be described as (1) dissociation of the DMF ligand from octahedra and formation of a square pyramid structure (rate determining step of the reaction), (2) rearrangement of the square pyramid to a triangular bipyramid structure and (3) association of MAI with I− in the axial position of Pb coordination and MA+ in the surrounding octahedral sites of the perovskite structure using hydrogen bonding. (b) A schematic which represents the procedure of the CE approach for the fabrication of the pure cubic MAPbI3 perovskite layer in sequential spin coating deposition.	 

 	Fig. 2  SEM images of the surface of the PbI2 layer as PbI2_OM (a), PbI2_CE over the mesoporous TiO2 substrate (b), perovskite layer as MAPbI3_OM (c), and MAPbI3_CE (d). Comparison of the XRD patterns (e). The peaks which are indicated by # correspond to glass–FTO–mpTiO2 layers. (f) Photoluminescence of the perovskite layers showing the corresponding absorbance spectra.	 

 	Fig. 3  Unit cell arrangement of the atoms in PbI2·DMF (a), MAPbI3 with cubic (b) and tetragonal (c) perovskite structures. BFDH morphology of PbI2·DMF (d), the MAPbI3 cubic phase (e) and the MAPbI3 tetrahedral phase (f). All the figures are evaluated by using Mercury CSD 3.8 (Build RC2) under the copyright of CCDC from crystallography information files (CIF) of PbI2·DMF, cubic and tetragonal MAPbI3 perovskite phases.	 

 	Fig. 4  Statistical results of overall efficiency, under AM1.5G illumination, of the PSCs containing spiro-OMeTAD (a) and P3HT (b) as the HTL and HTL-free (c) devices, in comparison with ordinary sequential deposition of the perovskite layer (OM) and the crystal engineering approach (CE).
