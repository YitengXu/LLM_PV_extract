    , Accepted 27th September 2020First published on 28th September 2020AbstractPerylene-bisimide (PDI)-based small molecules (PDI-Ph, PDI-PhCN, PDI-PhCN-2Br and PDI-PhCN-4Br) were synthesized via imidization of perylene bisanhydride and core-bromided perylene bisanhydride. The physical, optical and electronic properties of these molecules were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), UV-Vis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), cyclic voltammetry and space charge-limited current (SCLC). PDI-Ph, PDI-PhCN and PDI-PhCN-2Br show excellent thermal stability with decomposition temperatures above 400 °C (610 °C for PDI-PhCN) and high crystallinity with strong π–π stacking. The three molecules also exhibit high electron mobility with average values of 0.169 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PDI-Ph, 0.212 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PDI-PhCN and 0.119 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PDI-PhCN-2Br. Utilizing these molecules as the single electron-transporting layer (ETL), inverted perovskite solar cells with a configuration of ITO/NiOx/MAPbClxI3−x/ETL/Ag were fabricated. A power conversion efficiency of 14.6% was achieved from the device using PDI-PhCN as ETL. Furthermore, when BCP was used as the hole-blocking layer, the identical structured perovskite device achieved a high efficiency of 18.8% for the PDI-PhCN/BCP combination, which was better than the standard cell (17.4%) using C60/BCP as ETL. The superior performance of PDI-PhCN compared to PDI-Ph, PDI-PhCN-2Br and PDI-PhCN-4Br comes from its higher electron mobility and better matched energy levels with that of the absorber MAPbClxI3−x. Our results demonstrate that PDI-based small molecules are very promising electron-transporting materials for highly efficient, low-cost perovskite solar cells.
1. Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have undergone tremendous development since its first report with an efficiency of 3.8% in 2009.1 A power conversion efficiency (PCE) greater than 25% was recently achieved through optimization of the device configuration2,3 and engineering of the absorber crystallinity4–6 and interface property.7–10 Interface engineering has proved to be an effective strategy to improve the performance of PSCs, which significantly improves the carrier extraction and transportation from the perovskite layer to electrodes.7–11 One of the most effective interface engineering approaches is the design and selection of hole-transporting material (HTM) and electron-transporting material (ETM).11,12 The current widely used and efficient ETMs of fullerene (C60)13 and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)14 are very expensive, accounting for a large proportion of the cost of PSCs, and are also sensitive to oxygen, affecting the stability of PSCs. To solve the above deficiencies of fullerene ETMs, many non-fullerene substitutes have been explored, although satisfactory ones are still very limited.15–18 The current reported non-fullerene ETMs mainly include a few polymers consisting of naphthalene-diimide (NDI) or perylene-diimide (PDI) units18–23 and small molecules.24,25 While the polymers exhibit good solution processability, only a few of them have realized high efficiency without the presence of fullerene derivatives.19,26 The best performing perovskite solar cell using polymer ETM was reported by Kim et al.,27 in which a NDI-based polymer with strong electron-withdrawing dicyanothiophene was developed and used as the ETM in a device with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3−xClx/ETM/BCP/Ag cell, and achieved a 17.0% efficiency. Compared to polymer ETMs, small-molecule ETMs23 (including naphthalene-diimide,24 perylene-diimide,25,28,29 pyrazine-azaacene derivatives,30,31 and fused-ring electron acceptors32,33) not only possess some intrinsic advantages, such as definite molecular structure, high purity, good batch-to-batch repeatability and high mobility, but also demonstrate better performance than polymers.23 For example, the three naphthalene-diimide molecules (N,N′-bis(phenylmethyl)naphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic diimide, N,N′-bis(1-indanyl)naphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic diimide and N,N′-bis(1-phenylethyl)naphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic diimide) reported by the Kwon group24 were used as single ETM in a device with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/FAPbI3−xBrx/ETM/Al, and achieved high efficiencies of 19.6%, 20.2% and 20.5%, respectively. An n-type sulfur-containing small molecule hexaazatrinaphtho[2,3-c][1,2,5] thiadiazole reported by the Zhang group31 resulted in an 18.1% efficient inverted perovskite solar cell when used as a single ETM in a device of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3/ETM/LiF/Ag.
Among the small-molecule ETMs mentioned above, pyrazine-azaacene derivatives and fused-ring electron acceptors require painstaking synthesis procedures, and thus are not economical for large-scale application. Instead, naphthalene-diimide and perylene-diimide-based small molecules that use commercially available raw materials and take fewer synthetic procedures are a better choice. Although perylene-diimide small-molecules currently show inferior performance compared to naphthalene-diimide ones as ETMs in PSCs,23 they have great potential because they have higher electron mobility and thermal stability due to their large planarity and conjugation degree.34 However, few perylene-diimide small-molecules have demonstrated satisfactory performance as ETMs of perovskite solar cells, which was attributed to the dramatic decrease of mobility caused by irregular molecular aggregation when fabricated via solution-process.35,36 In this work, we synthesized a series of perylene-diimide small molecules that have simple structures and high thermal stability as ETM of perovskite solar cells. The high thermal stability enables the vacuum thermal deposition of these molecules, which ensures regular molecular packing to attain excellent electron mobility. Perovskite solar cells with a structure of ITO/NiOx/perovskite/ETM/Ag have been fabricated, and power conversion efficiencies of 10.9%, 14.6%, 12.7%, and 7.71% have been obtained from devices using PDI-Ph, PDI-PhCN, PDI-PhCN-2Br, and PDI-PhCN-4Br, respectively, as the single ETL. When combined with BCP as the ETL, an efficiency of 18.8% was achieved from the PDI-PhCN/BCP-based device, which is superior to the standard device (17.4%) using C60/BCP as ETL. Our results demonstrate that PDI-based molecules are very promising electron-transporting materials for highly efficient, low-cost and stable perovskite solar cells.

N,N′-Diphenylperylene-3,4:9:10-tetracarboxydiimide (PDI-Ph) and N,N′-di(4-cyanophenyl)per-ylene-3,4:9:10-tetracarboxydiimide (PDI-PhCN) were synthesized according to the reference,38 and the synthesis and characterization of N,N′-di(4-cyanophenyl)-1,7-dibromoperylene-3,4:9:10-tetracarboxydiimide (PDI-PhCN-2Br) and N,N′-di(4-cyanophenyl)-1,6,7,12-tetrabromoperylene-3,4:9:10-tetracarboxydiimide (PDI-PhCN-4Br) are described in the ESI.†38
2.4. Solar cell device fabrication
Perovskite solar cells with an inverted configuration (ITO/NiOx/perovskite/PDI-molecule (or PDI-molecule/BCP)/Ag) were fabricated. Here, perovskite MAPbClxI3−x was employed as the representative light-harvesting material to explore the performance of the PDI-molecules as electron-transporting materials (ETM) because it possesses a long carrier lifetime, high/balanced hole and electron mobility,39 which enables decent device performance and valid comparison. A thin NiOx layer (∼15 nm) was first deposited onto an ITO-coated glass substrate according to the ref. 37. Then, MAPbClxI3−x (∼300 nm) was fabricated on top of NiOx by the one-step fast deposition-crystallization procedure. Specifically, a DMF solution of MAPbClxI3−x (43%, wt%, PbI2:PbCl2:MAI (molar ratio) = 0.95:0.05:1) was spin-coated at 6000 rpm for 6.5 s, followed by immediate exposure to chlorobenzene to induce crystallization, then spun at 6000 rpm for 50 s. The MAPbClxI3−x film was annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. Then, a single ETM (PDI-Ph, PDI-PhCN, PDI-PhCN-2Br or PDI-PhCN-4Br) or bi-layer ETM (PDI-Ph/BCP, PDI-PhCN/BCP, PDI-PhCN-2Br/BCP, PDI-PhCN-4Br/BCP or C60/BCP) was deposited on top of the perovskite layer by thermal evaporation under high vacuum. Finally, Ag (100 nm) was thermally deposited as the top contact through a shadow mask.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis
The synthetic methods of the PDI-based molecules are outlined in Fig. 1. Compound PDI-Ph and PDI-PhCN were synthesized via aryl-amination catalyzed by anhydrous Zn(OAc)2 in quinoline solvent.40 The synthesis of compounds PDI-PhCN-2Br and PDI-PhCN-4Br proceeded via two steps: (1) bromination of the starting material PDO with a strong brominating agent of 1,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin in H2SO4 (100%); (2) aryl-amination with HOAc as both catalyst and solvent in order to avoid the reaction of aryl-amine and bromium on the bay position of PDO.38

3.2. Thermostability and molecular packing
The performance of organic electric devices highly depends on the quality of the functional materials, which require good stability and crystallinity. The thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) of the four PDI-based molecules are shown in Fig. 2a. All molecules exhibit good thermal stability with the decomposition temperatures starting at 553, 610, 416 and 398 °C for PDI-Ph, PDI-PhCN, PDI-PhCN-2Br and PDI-PhCN-4Br, respectively. The decomposition temperature increased approximately 60 °C when using electron-withdrawing benzonitrile on “N” to replace the electron-donating phenyl group. However, the decomposition temperature of bromine-PDI decreased with the increase of the bromine number on PDI bay. The decomposition temperature of these molecules exceeds that of the naphthalene-diimide molecules, pyrazine-azaacene derivatives and fused-ring electron acceptors (300–400 °C),24,41,42 which not only enables the possibility of thermal deposition, but also ensures the thermal stability of PSC when using them as ETM.

Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out to investigate the packing of the molecules in the solid state, and the results are shown in Fig. 2b. Sharp diffraction peaks were observed for all four molecules in diffraction angle between 20° and 30°. PDI-Ph, PDI-PhCN and PDI-PhCN-2Br exhibit two diffraction peaks, respectively at 27.79° and 25.00°, 26.15° and 23.83°, and 25.26° and 24.53°, corresponding to d-spacings of 3.21 and 3.56 Å, 3.41 and 3.73 Å, and 3.47 and 3.62 Å, respectively. The larger angle diffraction peak of this pair is attributed to H-type aggregation of the cofacial π–π stacking of the PDI plane with shorter intermolecular distance, while the smaller angle one is attributed to J-type aggregation of the head-to-tail π–π stacking of PDI molecules.43,44 For PDI-PhCN-4Br, only one sharp diffraction peak at 19.32° is observed, which corresponds to a d-spacing of 4.58 Å and can be attributed to J-type aggregation. The increased bulkiness and twist by the four bromine substituents hamper the face-to-face packing of the PDI-PhCN-4Br molecules, which is required for H-type aggregation.43,44 The sharp π–π stacking diffraction of the four compounds reveals the high crystallinity of the deposited films, which is beneficial for electron transport.
3.3. Photophysical and electrochemical property
To determine the energy levels of the four PDI molecules, the absorption spectra and cyclic voltammetry (CV) were investigated and the results are shown in Fig. 3. Benefitting from the PDI chromophores of the molecules, the vacuum-deposited films exhibit strong and broad absorption in the wavelength range from 300 to 600 nm (Fig. 3a). Compared to PDI-Ph, the absorption edge of PDI-PhCN is slightly red-shifted for 6 nm due to the electron-withdrawing benzonitrile on “N”, increasing the molecule conjugation. With two bromine on the PDI bay, the absorption edge of PDI-PhCN-2Br red-shifts for 20 nm due to p-π conjugation between “Br” and the PDI ring. Further increasing the number of bromine, the absorption of PDI-PhCN-4Br is greatly blue shifted because of the reduced molecular delocalization due to the tetrabromide substituents inducing PDI plane distortion and weak π–π stacking, as revealed by XRD results (Fig. 2b). The optical bandgaps (Eg,opt) of PDI-Ph, PDI-PhCN, PDI-PhCN-2Br and PDI-PhCN-4Br extracted from the absorption edges are 2.06, 2.04, 1.97 and 2.05 eV, respectively.

Within the cyclic voltammetry scanning range of −3.0 to +3.0 V measured (Fig. 3b), no oxidation waves were observed for all four molecules, indicating that they are insensitive to oxygen. Two reduction peaks are observed for PDI-Ph, PDI-PhCN and PDI-PhCN-2Br, whereas only one for PDI-PhCN-4Br. The onsets of the first reduction potential are −0.88, −0.77, −0.96 and −1.40 V (compared to that of ferrocene (Fc)) for PDI-Ph, PDI-PhCN, PDI-PhCN-2Br and PDI-PhCN-4Br, respectively. The LUMO levels are thus calculated to be −3.92 eV for PDI-Ph, −4.03 eV for PDI-PhCN, −3.84 eV for PDI-PhCN-2Br and −3.40 eV for PDI-PhCN-4Br based on the equation, ELUMO = −(Ered + 4.8).18 According to the formula of Eg,opt = ELUMO − EHOMO,18 the HOMO levels of PDI-Ph, PDI-PhCN, PDI-PhCN-2Br and PDI-PhCN-4Br, are calculated to be −5.98, −6.07, −5.81 and −5.45 eV, respectively. Except for PDI-PhCN-4Br, the energy levels of PDI-Ph, PDI-PhCN and PDI-PhCN-2Br match well with the commonly used perovskite materials, like MAPbClxI3−x or MAPbI3.39 The noticeably higher LUMO level of PhCN-4Br compared to others is because “Br” forms the p-π conjugation with the PDI plane, thus enhancing the electron density of the PDI bay, where the electronic clouds of LUMO are focused (Fig. S3, ESI†).
3.4. Electric property
The electron mobility of the PDI-based molecules was investigated by space charge limited current (SCLC) model.18 The SCLC is described by J = 9ε0εrμV2/8L3, where ε0 is the permittivity of the free space, εr is the dielectric constant of the PDI-molecules (3.8–5.3), μ is the hole mobility, V is the voltage drop across the device, L is the PDI-molecule thickness, and V = Vappl − Vr − Vbi, where Vappl is the applied voltage to the device, Vr is the voltage drop due to the contact resistance and series resistance across the electrodes, and Vbi is the built-in voltage due to the difference in work function of the two electrodes. The J–V curves of the electron-only devices with a structure of ITO/ZnO/PDI molecule/LiF/Al measured in dark are plotted in Fig. 4a, and the J–V curves of PDI-Ph device under different illumination conditions are plotted in Fig. 4b. The mobility statistic data of the four molecules are presented in Fig. S4 (ESI†) and Table 2. The electron mobility values extracted from the J–V curve fitting are 0.190 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PDI-Ph, 0.330 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PDI-PhCN, 0.121 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PDI-PhCN-2Br, and 0.00411 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PDI-PhCN-4Br. The mobility for PDI-Ph, PDI-PhCN and PDI-PhCN-2Br (Table 2) are comparable to the reported values of PDI-based molecules in the high crystallinity state.45,46 This means that the vacuum deposition method can solve the weakness of low mobility derived from the disordered aggregation of PDI molecules from the solution process. The electron mobility of PDI-Ph extracted from the dark J–V curve is only 0.129 cm2 V−1 s−1 and increases significantly to 1.405 cm2 V−1 s−1 under 100 mW cm−2 illumination (Fig. 4b). Under the work condition, the ETM of PDI-Ph in cell ITO/NiOx/perovskite (PVK)/PDI-Ph/Ag will be exposed to a small fraction of the 100 mW cm−2 illumination passing through ITO/NiOx/PVK (see Fig. S5, ESI†). Under the same illumination condition, the electron mobility of PDI-Ph was measured to be 0.428 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is much higher than that under darkness. More electron-only devices for PDI-Ph were investigated, and the mobility variation showed the same phenomena: the mobility is enhanced with the increase of light intensity (in Fig. S4, ESI†). The mobility of PDI-PhCN, PDI-PhCN-2Br and PDI-PhCN-4Br (in Fig. S4, ESI†) demonstrates the same trend as that of PDI-Ph. These results indicate that these molecules possess the characteristics of photo-induced mobility enhancement, which will improve the electron transportation of illuminated devices when using them as ETMs.

3.5. Perovskite solar cells using PDI-molecules as electron-transporting material
Using the PDI-molecule as the electron-transporting layer, the planar p–i–n perovskite solar cells with a configuration of ITO/NiOx/MAPbClxI3−x/PDI-molecule/Ag or ITO/NiOx/MAPbClxI3−x/PDI-molecule/BCP/Ag (in Fig. 5a) were fabricated and compared to the reference device using C60/BCP as ETL. Fig. 5b shows the energy diagram of the PDI-molecules and other materials used in the device. The LUMO energy levels (3.8–4.0 eV) of PDI-Ph, PDI-PhCN and PDI-PhCN-2Br match well that of MAPbClxI3−x (3.8 eV), which is expected to efficiently transfer an electron to the cathode. In contrast, an excessively higher LUMO energy level of PDI-PhCN-4Br (3.4 eV) than MAPbClxI3−x (3.8 eV) can form a barrier to the electron transfer. The HOMO energy levels of PDI-Ph (5.98 eV), PDI-PhCN (6.07 eV) and PDI-PhCN-2Br (5.81 eV) are lower than that of MAPbClxI3−x (5.4 eV), which indicates that PDI-Ph, PDI-PhCN and PDI-PhCN-2Br can be employed individually as ETM to block hole from penetrating to the cathode, while the close HOMO energy level of PDI-PhCN-4Br (5.45 eV) with MAPbClxI3−x (5.4 eV) cannot play the role of blocking holes. Further combining these PDI-molecules with BCP, which has a deep HOMO energy level of 7.0 eV, can more efficiently block the hole compared to PDI-only ETL. The top view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the MAPbClxI3−x film and cross section SEM image of the finished device with PDI-PhCN as ETM are shown in Fig. 5c and d. A uniform and dense perovskite MAPbClxI3−x film with large grains in micrometer sizes can be clearly seen in Fig. 5c. From Fig. 5d, under the perovskite layer, a continuous and compact NiOx (∼15 nm) hole-transporting layer is formed. On top of the perovskite layer, the PDI-PhCN molecules form a compact and flat ETL with excellent adherence to both perovskite and top BCP. These features ensure decent device performance and a valid comparison for PSCs based on PDI-molecule/BCP and C60/BCP.

(c) Top view SEM image of MAPbClxI3−x film on the ITO/NiOx substrate. (d) Cross-section SEM image of the PSC device with PDI-PhCN as ETM. 
The current density–voltage (J–V) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the best performing devices using the PDI-molecule or PDI-molecule/BCP as ETM and the reference device using C60/BCP are shown in Fig. 6. The average device parameters with standard deviations are summarized in Table 3. The effect of the PDI-molecule or BCP thickness on the device performance has been investigated, and the results are given in Tables S1–S6 (ESI†). The thickness of the sole PDI-molecule as ETM is optimized to be approximately 25 nm. The J–V curve of the device without ETM is also shown for comparison, which has very poor performance with PCE < 1.0%.

When PDI-Ph was used as the single ETM, the best performing device showed an efficiency of 10.9% with JSC, VOC and FF of 20.2 mA cm−2, 0.85 V and 0.633, respectively (Fig. 6a, Table 3 and Table S1, ESI†). For PDI-PhCN as the single ETM, the solar cell performance was significantly improved with JSC, VOC, FF and PCE of 22.3 mA cm−2, 0.96 V, 0.683 and 14.6% (Fig. 6a, Table 3 and Table S2, ESI†), respectively. Whereas, for PDI-PhCN-2Br as the single ETM, the device performance decreases compared to PDI-PhCN, with JSC, VOC, FF and PCE of 22.2 mA cm−2, 0.80 V, 0.711 and 12.7%, respectively (Fig. 6a, Table 3 and Table S3, ESI†). For PDI-PhCN-4Br as the single ETM, the solar cell shows the worst performance with 7.71% efficiency. The better device performance for PDI-PhCN is probably attributed to the higher electron mobility (Table 2) and deeper HOMO energy level of PDI-PhCN (Table 1), which reduces the device resistance and charge carrier recombination, and thus decreases the voltage loss and enhances charge collection.47 The poor performance of PDI-PhCN-4Br-based devices with low JSC and FF is due to its two order of magnitude lower electron mobility (Fig. 6a, Table 2 and Table S4, ESI†) than the other three PDI-molecules and unmatched energy levels with perovskite, which cannot efficiently transfer electrons and block holes.
Although solely used PDI-Ph, PDI-PhCN and PDI-PhCN-2Br have played important ETM roles, the solar cell efficiencies are unsatisfied due to the relatively lower VOC and FF than reported devices with the identical structure. In view of the excellent electron mobilities of these molecules, their energy-level alignment and interfacial contact are the main factors that restrict their device performance. From the aspect of the energy-level alignment, the HOMO energy level of either molecule is not deep enough to efficiently block the holes transferring to the cathode, which can lead to the adverse carrier recombination. From the other aspect of interfacial contact, the intense photoluminescence (PL) quenching of pristine MAPbClxI3−x by PDI-Ph, PDI-PhCN, PDI-PhCN-2Br and PDI-PhCN-4Br (Fig. S6, ESI†) indicates excellent electron extraction capability of these PDI-molecules, as well as good interfacial contacts between MAPbClxI3−x and PDI-molecules. Subsequently, the surface morphologies of the PDI-molecules on perovskite were investigated by AFM and SEM (Fig. 7). The SEM images showed that except for the perovskite grain boundaries becoming unclear, the surfaces of PDI-Ph/MAPbClxI3−x, PDI-PhCN/MAPbClxI3−x, and PDI-PhCN-2Br/MAPbClxI3−x have no evident change compared to MAPbClxI3−x, while PDI-PhCN-4Br showed visible aggregation on the MAPbClxI3−x surface. The AFM images showed that the roughness (Ra) increases from 5.91 to 8.78, 9.30, 9.34 and 13.6 nm after deposition of the PDI-molecules on the MAPbClxI3−x, probably due to aggregation of the PDI-molecules, which will impact the interface contacts with the Ag electrode. All of these factors combined could lead to interface charge accumulation and recombination, and thus the lower VOC and FF of the devices.
 Fig. 7  Top view SEM and AFM images of MAPbClxI3−x (a, a′), PDI-Ph/MAPbClxI3−x (b, b′), PDI-PhCN/MAPbClxI3−x (c, c′), PDI-PhCN-2Br/MAPbClxI3−x (d, d′) and PDI-PhCN-4Br/MAPbClxI3−x (e, e′) films on the NiOx/ITO substrates. 
Therefore, we further added an excellent hole-blocking layer of BCP between the PDI-molecule and Ag. First, we fabricated a reference device using a conventional combination of C60 (40 nm) and BCP (10 nm) bilayer as ETM. The solar cell performance with JSC, VOC, FF and PCE of 21.5 mA cm−2, 1.07 V, 0.755 and 17.4% was achieved, which is comparable to the similarly structured PSC in the literature.39 Then, on top of the optimal 25 nm thick PDI-molecule layer, the BCP layer was deposited and its optimized thickness is approximately 7 nm (Tables S5 and S6, ESI†). For PDI-Ph/BCP as the ETM, a champion device with JSC, VOC, FF and PCE of 22.1 mA cm−2, 0.92 V, 0.740 and 15.0% was achieved (Fig. 6b, Table 2 and Table S5, ESI†). Except for JSC, all of the other parameters are lower than that of the reference device. When PDI-PhCN/BCP was used as the ETM, the device exhibited superior performance to the reference device with JSC, VOC, FF and PCE of 22.7 mA cm−2, 1.05 V, 0.787 and 18.8% (Fig. 6b, Table 2 and Table S6, ESI†), respectively. For PDI-PhCN-2Br/BCP as the ETM, the best device efficiency of 16.0% is slightly inferior to the reference device (17.4%) due to the decreased VOC of 0.90 V (Fig. 6b, Table 2 and Table S6, ESI†). For PDI-PhCN-4Br/BCP as the ETM, the device performed far worse than the reference device with an efficiency of 10.8%. Overall, the device performance using PDI-molecule/BCP as the ETM is significantly improved by about 30–40% than that solely using the PDI-molecule. Among these PDI-molecule/BCP combinations, PDI-PhCN/BCP realizes the best device efficiency, while PDI-Ph/BCP and PDI-PhCN-2Br/BCP both exhibit medium performance. PDI-PhCN-4Br/BCP shows the worst performance, which is mainly attributed to the difference in the electron mobility of the PDI-molecules (Table 2).
Devices using the PDI-molecule as single ETM show similar external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves in the wavelength range of 300–790 nm (Fig. 6c). The JSC integrated from the EQE spectra are 19.4, 21.0, 20.9, and 18.7 mA cm−2 for PDI-Ph, PDI-PhCN, PDI-PhCN-2Br and PDI-PhCN-4Br-based solar cells, respectively, in excellent agreement with that measured from the J–V characterization in Fig. 6a. The PDI-PhCN and PDI-PhCN-2Br devices show higher EQE than the PDI-Ph and PDI-PhCN-4Br devices in all wavelength ranges. Devices using the PDI molecule/BCP as ETM show similar EQE curves to that of the C60/BCP reference device in the wavelength range of 300–790 nm (Fig. 6d). The JSC integrated from the EQE spectra are 20.6, 21.0, 21.4, 21.1 and 19.2 mA cm−2 for C60/BCP, PDI-Ph/BCP, PDI-PhCN/BCP, PDI-PhCN-2Br/BCP and PDI-PhCN-4Br/BCP based solar cells, respectively, in excellent agreement with that measured from the J–V characterization in Fig. 6b. Except PDI-PhCN-4Br/BCP, the PDI-Ph/BCP, PDI-PhCN/BCP and PDI-PhCN-2Br/BCP based devices show higher EQE than the C60/BCP reference device in the wavelength ranges of 370–500 nm (Fig. 6d), probably due to the higher mobility and thinner thicknesses of PDI-molecules (∼0.212 cm2 V−1 s−1, 25 nm) than C60 (∼0.03 cm2 V−1 s−1, 40 nm),48 reducing the device resistance and carrier loss during the transmission. The PDI-PhCN/BCP device also exhibits higher EQE than all others between 650 and 740 nm because of the higher mobility of PDI-PhCN. The higher EQE and PCE of the PDI-PhCN/BCP device in comparison to the reference device demonstrate the advantage of using the PDI-PhCN molecule to substitute C60 as ETM for PSCs.
4. Conclusions
In summary, four perylene-bisimide (PDI) based small molecules (PDI-Ph, PDI-PhCN, PDI-PhCN-2Br, PDI-PhCN-4Br) were synthesized via aryl-amination and bromination of perylene anhydride. TGA, UV-Vis, XRD, and CV characterizations reveal that the PDI-molecules have outstanding thermostability with decomposition temperatures higher than 400 °C (over 600 °C for PDI-PhCN, the most thermostable known small-molecule semiconductor), high crystallinity with strong π–π stacking, and well matched energy levels (except PDI-PhCN-4Br) to that of the perovskite absorbers. These molecules exhibit high electron mobility (as high as ∼0.2 cm2 V−1 s−1) and photo-induced mobility enhancement. Utilizing these molecules as single ETM, perovskite solar cells with an inverted configuration of ITO/NiOx/MAPbClxI3−x/ETM/Ag were successfully fabricated. Power conversion efficiencies of 10.9%, 14.6% 12.7% and 7.71% were achieved from PDI-Ph, PDI-PhCN, PDI-PhCN-2Br and PDI-PhCN-4Br, respectively. When combining these molecules with BCP as ETL, the device efficiencies were improved to 15.0%, 18.8%, 16.0% and 10.8%, respectively. The solar cell performance of the PDI-PhCN/BCP device is superior to that of the reference cell using C60/BCP as ETM (PCE of 17.4%) due to the superior electron mobility of PDI-PhCN (∼0.212 cm2 V−1 s−1) in comparison to that of C60 (∼0.03 cm2 V−1 s−1). By further modifying the PDI-molecule structure to lower its HOMO level enough to more efficiently block the hole, one can avoid using BCP to realize higher efficiency. Our results demonstrate that the PDI-based small molecules are very promising electron-transporting materials for more efficient and economical perovskite solar cells.
