    , Accepted 22nd August 2019First published on 22nd August 2019AbstractBiphase ↔ triphase switching in TiO2 nanotubes is observed with the change in electrolyte concentration using the rapid breakdown anodization technique. The phase composition of TiO2 nanotubes switches from anatase–rutile–brookite to anatase–brookite and vice versa. The tubular morphology of the samples is revealed from the SEM and TEM micrographs. All the phases are found to be present in a single nanotube, forming heterojunctions. The photocatalytic hydrogen generation efficiencies of TiO2 nanotubes with anatase–rutile–brookite heterojunctions are compared with those of nanotubes having anatase–brookite (obtained by tuning the electrolyte concentration) and anatase–rutile heterojunctions (obtained from the same technique reported elsewhere). The higher water splitting efficiencies of triphasic heterojunctions compared to those of biphasic junctions are attributed to effective charge separation because of cascaded charge transfer through sequential heterojunctions. This leads to the accumulation of electrons and holes in the lowest conduction band and highest valence band levels, respectively, among the phases. The present study supports the theory that a triphasic system is more efficient in photocatalysis compared to two-phase systems. In addition, this study also reports that anatase–brookite biphasic TiO2 is more efficient compared to the widely studied anatase–rutile biphasic TiO2 for the first time.
1. Introduction
The photocatalytic ability of semiconductor materials is being investigated actively because of their promising potential in converting solar energy to clean energy.1 The basic process is photo-generation of electrons and holes in the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB), respectively, of the semiconductor, and their transfer to the surface initiating various redox reactions leading to energy conversion and degradation of environmental pollutants. The oxidizing power of the holes, which is a function of the VB position, often photo-corrodes the semiconductors themselves limiting their long term stability and hence practical application.2 In this respect, TiO2 is a superior photocatalyst having very high resistance to photo-corrosion in different environments.3 In addition to long term stability, its cost effectiveness, abundance, the presence of highly oxidizing holes and environmentally friendly features make TiO2 a potential photocatalytic material for long term applications. However, its wide application is limited because of its low light to chemical energy conversion efficiency. Its low conversion efficiency is attributed to high electron–hole recombination and low visible light absorption.4 An efficient way to reduce the recombination of photo-induced charge carriers is the introduction of metal/TiO2 heterojunctions by noble metal (Pt, Au, Pd, and Ag) nanoparticle loading.5,6 The photo-generated electrons are trapped by the loaded metal nanoparticles which form a Schottky barrier at the TiO2/metal interface.7 However, the high cost of the noble metals limits their commercial application. Another option is surface loading with other semiconductors,8,9 dyes,10,11etc. Most of the semiconductors and dyes identified for this purpose do not have long term stability as they are amenable to photo-corrosion. Recently, mesoporous TiO2 with an ordered pore structure and multiphase TiO2 with bulk heterojunctions have been identified as potential photocatalysts with effective charge separation.5,12,13
In meso-titania, efficient electron–hole separation is achieved through charge transfer across the interface. Recently, it has been observed that mesoporous quasi one-dimensional nanoarchitectures like nanofibres and nanotubes offer better photocatalytic performance due to effective charge separation through intergrain charge transfer along the one-dimensional framework because of the nanograin alignment.14,15
In TiO2 heterojunctions, efficient charge separation is effected because of the proper band alignment.16,17 The photo-generated electrons and holes are transferred across the junctions leading to electron and hole accumulation in the energetically favorable CB and VB, respectively, of the phases. Appropriate phase selection based on the conduction and valence band edge positions leads to cascaded transfer of charge carriers from one phase to another.
Among the TiO2 composites, the anatase–rutile (AR) phase mixture is the most studied photocatalyst.5,16,18 Its enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to the efficient charge separation across the phase junction. Studies on the other possible two-phase mixtures, anatase–brookite19,20 (AB) and rutile–brookite21 (RB), also revealed better photocatalytic activity compared to the single phase TiO2.
Though there are enough reports on the photocatalytic activity of single phase and binary TiO2 systems, studies on ternary anatase–rutile–brookite (ARB) systems are very limited because of the complexity involved in their synthesis. The reports available in the open literature pertain to the synthesis and use of ARB for photocatalytic degradation of selected water pollutants.12 Unlike a biphasic system where the photo-generated charge carriers can possibly recombine at the heterojunction, in the triphasic heterojunction, two sequential heterojunctions with a potential gradient reduce the chance of direct recombination by allowing the charge carriers to transfer to the third phase.22 Hence, triphasic TiO2 is expected to outperform biphasic TiO2 in photocatalysis.
Hydrogen generation by water photolysis is an uphill (ΔG > 0) multi-electron process, which is kinetically and stochastically hindered as simultaneous multi-photon absorption by a single particle is difficult under solar irradiation conditions.2 However, in TiO2 with three-phase heterojunctions, the multi-electron process is favored because of the cascade charge transfer through the sequential heterojunctions resulting in electron accumulation in the phase with the lowest CB level and hole accumulation in the phase with the highest VB level.2 Since the band positions of anatase, rutile and brookite are not far apart, the loss in photocatalytic activity is very little as the energy loss of electrons and holes, due to their transfer to the lowest CB and highest VB, respectively, is minimal. Based on the above, one can make efficient TiO2 photocatalysts by synthesizing mesoporous quasi one-dimensional nano-architectures of TiO2, like nanotubes and fibers, having triphasic heterojunctions.
In the present work, we report a facile technique for phase composition switching in TiO2 nanotube powders resulting in biphasic and triphasic compositions. The TiO2 nanotubes can be easily switched from AB ↔ ARB composition by simply changing the electrolyte concentration at room temperature. The solar water splitting efficiencies of the synthesized biphasic (AB) and triphasic (ARB) heterojunction TiO2 nanotubes are evaluated. In addition, the water splitting efficiency of the AR composition, obtained using the same technique in our earlier study,22 is compared to identify the favorable phase composition for enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen generation. Thus, a novel technique of controllable phase composition engineering is successfully developed and studied, and the photocatalytic hydrogen generation efficiencies of the various heterostructures obtained are compared for the first time.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of TiO2 nanotube powders
TiO2 nanotube powders are prepared by the rapid breakdown anodization technique. In this technique, the anodization of titanium foil is performed by keeping it as the working electrode, platinum foil as the counter electrode and a perchloric acid solution as the electrolyte.5,15 In our earlier work,22 the perchloric acid solution concentration is kept constant at 0.1 M and the applied potential is varied which resulted in different phase compositions of TiO2 nanotubes. In that report, highly crystalline triphasic TiO2 is obtained at 11 V. Therefore, in this work, anodization of the titanium foil is achieved by keeping the applied potential constant at 11 V using a programmable DC power supply (Agilent N6700 series), with varying concentrations of perchloric acid solutions such as 0.07, 0.1, 0.12 and 0.15 M. The 99% pure titanium foil of 0.5 mm thickness, cut to a size of 2.5 × 0.5 cm2, is first polished smoothly to remove the oxide layer from its surface. The polished foil is then ultrasonicated in alcohol and acetone followed by water, and dried in a N2 gas stream. The cleaned titanium foil and Pt foil are kept 15 mm apart in perchloric acid solution (with varying concentrations) to perform the anodization at a constant voltage (11 V). The anodization continues till the whole Ti foil is etched into TiO2 powders in the electrolyte solution which are then collected, washed many times with DI water, centrifuged and dried at 70 °C for 15 hours. The TiO2 powders synthesized in the 0.07, 0.1, 0.12 and 0.15 M HClO4 electrolytes are hereafter referred to as T-0.07, T-0.10, T-0.12 and T-0.15, respectively.
2.2. Material characterization
The phase compositions of the TiO2 nanotube powder samples are identified using an X-ray diffractometer (D8, Bruker). The surface morphology of the samples is analyzed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), (JEOL 6360) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM) (JEOL 2010). Drops of methanol containing suspended TiO2 powders are placed on a carbon coated copper grid and dried to be studied using TEM. The crystal structure of the samples is analyzed using high resolution TEM (HRTEM). Band gaps of the samples are evaluated using a UV-visible spectrometer (PerkinElmer, Lambda 750S) having a 60 mm diameter integrated sphere in reflectance mode. Micro Raman spectra of the TiO2 samples are collected using a Renishaw Raman spectrometer equipped with a laser source of 514 nm wavelength. Photoluminescence from the samples is recorded using a photoluminescence spectrometer (Renishaw, UK), operating with a 325 nm “He–Cd laser” (power level of 200 mW) and a confocal microscope.
2.3. Hydrogen quantification
The photocatalytic water splitting ability of the samples is evaluated by keeping the rubber septum sealed photocatalytic quartz cell (50 mL capacity), containing 10 mg of sample dispersed in ethanol aqueous solution (1:4 ratio) after purging with argon for 30 minutes, 20 cm away from the irradiating solar simulator under one sun conditions (measured irradiation power of the xenon arc lamp: 300 mW cm−2 with an AM 1.5 cut-off filter). The amount of hydrogen generated in the photocatalytic cell containing the samples is measured every hour for a total of 4 hours of reaction time by periodically withdrawing gas samples through the rubber septum and quantifying using a gas chromatograph (GC, Agilent 7690).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis of TiO2 nanotube powders
In order to study the effect of electrolyte concentration on morphology and phase composition, TiO2 nanotube powders are synthesized, at a constant voltage of 11 V (±0.03 V) with variation in electrolyte concentration (at 0.07, 0.1, 0.12 and 0.15 M HClO4). It is noticed that the time taken to complete the transformation of foil into powder is inversely proportional to the concentration of electrolyte. This is due to the increase in the etching rate by chloride species at higher electrolyte concentrations.
3.2. Phase evolution
The XRD patterns of the TiO2 nanotubes synthesized at different electrolyte concentrations are shown in Fig. 1. The reflections from the obtained diffraction patterns are compared with the corresponding diffraction peaks of the anatase, rutile and brookite phases (JCPDS files: anatase: 21-1272; rutile: 21-1276; brookite: 29-1360). It is noticed that all the three phases are found in T-0.07 and T-0.1. As the electrolyte concentration is increased from 0.07 to 0.15 M, the intensity of XRD peaks corresponding to the rutile phase in the synthesized TiO2 nanotube powders is found to gradually decrease and completely disappear at 0.15 M (T-0.15). It is also observed that the intensity of brookite peaks increases with the increase in electrolyte concentration. The phase switching from rutile to brookite with the increase in electrolyte concentration is evident from Fig. 1. The quantification of phase composition in each TiO2 sample is carried out using the following equations:23 Wa = KaAa/(KaAa + Ar + KbAb)(1) Wr = Ar/(KaAa + Ar + KbAb)(2) Wb = KbAb/(KaAa + Ar + KbAb)(3)where Wa, Wr and Wb denote the mass fractions of the anatase, rutile and brookite phases, respectively; Aa, Ar and Ab denote the integrated intensities of the anatase (101), rutile (110) and brookite (121) phases, respectively. Ka and Kb represents the correction coefficients which have values of 0.886 and 2.721, respectively.23 Quantified phase compositions and grain sizes of the phases obtained using the Scherrer equation from the characteristic XRD peaks of anatase A (101), rutile R (110) and brookite B (121) are tabulated in Table 1. The phase compositions of the different samples also indicate the rutile to brookite phase transformation with the increase in electrolyte concentration. The grain size of anatase is unaltered whereas that of rutile decreases and that of brookite increases. The energetics of the phases is sufficiently close that they could be reversed by slight differences in surface energy.

The phase compositions of the TiO2 nanotubes synthesized at different electrolyte concentrations are also examined by Raman spectra analysis (Fig. 2). The characteristic Raman modes at around 148, 402, 515, and 630 cm−1 corresponding to the Eg, B1g, A1g/B1g and Eg modes, respectively, of anatase are found in all the samples.24 The Raman modes that appear at around 245, 322 and 360 cm−1 represent the A1g, B1g and B2g modes, respectively,25 of the brookite phase, which is present in all the samples. The peak at around 448 cm−1 corresponding to the Eg mode of rutile and that at around 240 cm−1, representing a second order scattering effect in the rutile phase,26 are present in T-0.07 and T-0.1. However, their intensities decrease in T-0.12 and they totally disappear in T-0.15. Thus, T-0.07 and T-0.1 possess all three phases whereas rutile is diminished in T-0.12 and is absent in T-0.15. The Raman analysis again proves that the increase in electrolyte concentration induces the ARB to AB phase transformation.

3.3. Structural analysis
FESEM images of the TiO2 samples T-0.07, T-0.12 and T-0.15 are shown in Fig. 3a–c, where the tubular morphology is visible. The tube diameters are in the range of 30 to 120 nm. It is very clear that the change in electrolyte concentration doesn't affect the tubular morphology. Fig. 3d–f show the TEM images of the corresponding TiO2 nanotubes. The existence of all the phases in a single TiO2 nanotube is evident from the HRTEM results (Fig. 3g–i). The formation of similar heterojunctions was observed in the case of electrochemically synthesized TiO2 nanotubes by tuning the applied potential at a given electrolyte concentration.17,22 From the HRTEM image of the sample, T-0.07 (Fig. 3g), it is evident that the well resolved lattice features of anatase, rutile and brookite exist in proximity, forming heterojunctions. Similar features are observed in the case of T-0.1 which is not shown here. The interfaces between the different phases aid charge carrier transfer from one phase to another after light excitation, thus enhancing their lifetimes and thereby increasing their photocatalytic efficiencies.13,16,17,22 The interplanar spacing pertaining to the rutile phase is not frequently observed in proximity in the HRTEM images of T-0.12, as shown in Fig. 3h, whereas it is totally absent in the case of T-0.15 (Fig. 3i). These observations again confirm that the TiO2 nanotubes undergo phase transformation with the increase in electrolyte concentration, corroborating with the results of XRD and Raman spectra analysis.

3.4. Band gap analysis
The optical properties of the TiO2 nanotubes synthesized at different electrolyte concentrations were analyzed using UV-visible DRS (Fig. 4). The Kubelka–Munk (KM) function for the DRS spectra is represented as: F(K) = (αhv)1/n = A(hv − Eg)(4)where α, ν, A and Eg denote the absorption coefficient, light frequency, proportionality constant and band gap, respectively. The value of n is a constant value of either 1/2 or 2, depending on the type of semiconductor. The band gap values of the samples are evaluated from an F(K) = (αhν)1/2vs. hν plot (assuming TiO2 as an indirect band gap semiconductor) by extrapolating straight lines to the x-axis, whose values are listed in Fig. 4. It is noticed that the band gap values are independent of the phase composition. All the samples possess band gap values which are in same range at around 3.1 eV. Therefore, it is evident that the change in electrolyte concentration doesn't affect the band gap but instead only changes the phase composition.

3.5. Water splitting
The amounts of hydrogen generated by the TiO2 nanotubes synthesized at different electrolyte concentrations are presented in Fig. 5. Sample T-0.07 produces more hydrogen (655 μmol g−1 under solar irradiation for 4 hours) compared to the other samples at each hour of light irradiation. Similarly, the amount of hydrogen generated by T-0.1 is almost equal to that of T-0.07. In the case of the samples synthesized with higher electrolyte concentrations, viz. T-0.12 and T-0.15, the hydrogen generation drops to lower values at each hour of light irradiation (for example: T-0.12 and T-0.15 generated 582 and 538 μmol g−1 hydrogen at 4 hours of irradiation). The surface morphology and band gap analysis clearly indicate that there is no phenomenal difference in the samples synthesized using different electrolyte concentrations. The only significant difference among these samples is the phase composition which is clear from the XRD and Raman spectra (Fig. 1 and 2). Therefore, the hydrogen generation results indicate that the better water splitting efficiencies of T-0.07 and T-0.1 are due to the presence of the triphasic composition in the synthesized TiO2 nanotubes. The decrement in the water splitting ability of T-0.12 can be ascribed to its low content of the rutile phase. The relatively low water splitting ability of T-0.15 can be attributed to its anatase–brookite biphasic nature. The amount of hydrogen generated by highly efficient sample T-0.07 (ARB) is 1.25 times that of the T-0.15 (AB) TiO2 nanotubes.

In our earlier work, we obtained biphasic TiO2 with the anatase–rutile composition by tuning the synthesis potential22 at a constant electrolyte concentration (0.1 M HClO4) with the RBA technique. In the present work, the simple tuning of electrolyte concentration yields TiO2 nanotubes with anatase–brookite and anatase–rutile–brookite compositions. Combining these two results, the hydrogen generation efficiencies of TiO2 nanotubes with anatase–rutile, anatase–brookite and anatase–rutile–brookite compositions are compared (Fig. 6). The hydrogen generation efficiencies are found to be in the order ARB > AB > AR, thus making a triphase more efficient compared to biphasic structures. Also, among different biphasic TiO2 nanotubes, the AB composition is found to be more efficient than the most widely discussed AR photocatalyst.

3.6. Mott–Schottky analysis
The Mott–Schottky plots of the TiO2 nanotubes prepared at different electrolyte concentrations display a positive slope (Fig. 7), indicating n-type semiconducting behavior. The observed flat band potentials (Efb) are in the order T-0.07 > T-0.1 > T-0.12 > T-0.15. These results corroborate with the results of hydrogen generation. Under the illumination of UV light, the charge carriers in the valence band get excited to the conduction band in each phase of the multiphase semiconductor system. These excited charge carriers transfer from one phase to another due to the favorable band alignment and hence leads to the overall shift of the Fermi level towards the conduction band edge. This gives rise to a higher degree of band bending and hence a higher Efb. The extent of Fermi level shift depends on the number of phase junctions.22 Therefore, the nearly equal and high Efb values of T-0.07 and T-0.1 indicating high charge pair separation can be attributed to the presence of triphasic heterojunctions, whereas the decrease in Efb values of the samples synthesized with higher electrolyte concentrations, as in the case of T-0.12 (less triphasic) and T-0.15 (biphase), can be attributed to the transformation of ARB (triphase) into AB (biphase). The Mott–Schottky analysis of AR TiO2 nanotubes obtained in our previous study has been compared with that of ARB (T-0.1) and AB (T-0.15) TiO2 obtained in the present work (Fig. 8). The Efb values are in the order ARB > AB > AR, in agreement with the hydrogen generation results (Fig. 6). This clearly indicates the superior charge separation efficiencies of triphasic TiO2 compared to those of the biphasic forms.

3.7. Photoluminescence spectra
The photoluminescence spectra of TiO2 nanotubes synthesized under different electrolyte concentrations are given in Fig. 9. The PL intensity in the region from 1.8 to 2.7 eV is contributed by the defects present in the samples, whereas the intensity in the region from 2.7 to 3.3 eV is due to the band edge emission.22 Secondary peak emission in the range of 1.8 to 2.7 eV is present in all the samples. The peak at around 2.1 eV is attributed to oxygen vacancy related defects and under-coordinated Ti acting as electron traps.27,28 The peak intensity at around 2.3 eV is attributed to the surface defects generated due to oxygen deficiency and the associated Ti3+ ions.28–31 The PL of all the samples exhibits nearly the same intensity in the region from 1.75 eV to 2.4 eV, which indicates that the change in electrolyte concentration doesn't affect the presence of defects significantly. In the near band edge emission region (2.7 eV to 3.3 eV), there is a slight difference in the PL intensities among the samples. A close look at this region (inset of Fig. 9) reveals that T-0.07 and T-0.1 have the same intensity whereas it increased in T-0.12 and more in T-0.15. This slight variation of intensities can be caused due to the differences in phase composition of the different samples of TiO2 nanotubes as T-0.07 and T-0.1 have a triphasic composition, T-0.12 is less triphasic and T-0.15 is biphasic. This clearly states that triphasic TiO2 nanotubes can enhance charge carrier separation, superior to the efficiency of biphasic (anatase–brookite) TiO2 nanotubes. The PL results also corroborate with the results of Mott–Schottky analysis and hydrogen generation.

3.8. Band alignment and charge transfer pathway
The band alignment and charge transfer pathway in a multiphase system are difficult to calculate due to their complexity. In our earlier report, the photo-excited charge transfer pathway in triphasic TiO2 is evaluated to be from rutile to anatase to brookite.22 The same direction of charge transfer is proposed in other reports on triphasic TiO2.12 Assuming the same, the charge transfer pathway in the anatase–brookite biphasic system is presumed to be from anatase to brookite and the schematic of the charge transfer process when the TiO2 nanotube samples switch from triphasic ↔ biphasic is shown in Fig. 10.

4. Conclusion
A facile and simple method for synthesizing high quality TiO2 nanotube powders consisting of anatase–brookite and anatase–rutile–brookite phase compositions was developed. The presence of three-phase and two-phase heterojunctions in each nanotube, corresponding to the phase composition, is discerned by HRTEM. The tuning of phase composition could be easily achieved by varying the electrochemical process parameters. As we increase the electrolyte concentration from 0.07 to 0.15 M, the synthesized TiO2 nanotubes alter their phase composition from ARB to AB, thus switching from triphasic to biphasic. It is found that the band gap of different TiO2 nanotubes doesn't depend on the phase composition. The flat band potential values and PL spectra analysis indicate the presence of high charge pair separation in triphasic TiO2 nanotubes compared to the biphasic forms. The enhanced charge separation gives rise to high water splitting efficiency of triphasic TiO2 compared to biphasic (AB) TiO2 nanotubes. The hydrogen generation efficiencies of TiO2 nanotubes with different phase compositions are found to be in the order ARB > AB > AR. The obtained results emphasize that there is plenty of room to be explored for triphasic TiO2 as done with the prevalently studied anatase–rutile biphasic composition. The results also emphasize the importance of anatase–brookite phase mixtures compared to the anatase–rutile phase mixture.
