    , Accepted 3rd November 2017First published on 16th November 2017AbstractThe interface characteristic is a crucial factor determining the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, our aim is to conduct a comparative study on the interface characteristics between the very famous non-fullerene acceptor, ITIC, and a fullerene acceptor, PC71BM by combining molecular dynamics simulations with density functional theory. Based on some typical interface models of the acceptor ITIC or PC71BM and the donor PBDB-T selected from MD simulation, besides the evaluation of charge separation/recombination rates, the relative positions of Frenkel exciton (FE) states and the charge transfer states along with their oscillator strengths are also employed to estimate the charge separation abilities. The results show that, when compared with those for the PBDB-T/PC71BM interface, the CT states are more easily formed for the PBDB-T/ITIC interface by either the electron transfer from the FE state or direct excitation, indicating the better charge separation ability of the former. Moreover, the estimation of the charge separation efficiency manifests that although these two types of interfaces have similar charge recombination rates, the PBDB-T/ITIC interface possesses the larger charge separation rates than those of the PBDB-T/PC71BM interface. Therefore, the better match between PBDB-T and ITIC together with a larger charge separation efficiency at the interface are considered to be the reasons for the prominent performance of ITIC in OSCs.
Introduction
The bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cell (OSC) is among the promising green energy alternatives for future renewable energy conversion because of its numerous advantages such as low-cost, low-weight, and flexibility.1–4 Over the past decades, different from the ‘flowers blooming’ phenomena of the donor materials,5–7 among the acceptor materials, fullerene derivatives always outshine the others. Most OSCs use fullerene derivatives as the acceptor materials due to their high electron affinity, electron mobility, isotropic charge transport as well as the formation of an appropriate phase separation.8–11 Moreover, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 10%12 has been achieved with the BHJ architecture using fullerene derivatives. However, fullerene derivatives have some intrinsic limitations, such as a weak absorption in the visible region and high-cost in the synthesis and purification processes.13 To address these issues, non-fullerene electron acceptor materials with good light absorption, facile synthesis and fine-tuned energy levels have been developed rapidly in recent years. Some of these exhibit PCEs even higher than those of the fullerene-based OSCs.14–21
Recently, numerous non-fullerene acceptors containing the fused-ring unit have been designed and excellent performance (PCE of 6–12%) has been achieved for the photovoltaic devices based on these materials.22–32 One of the most important reports was recorded by Hou et al.; the group prepared a fused-ring electron acceptor ITIC (3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3(1,1-dicyanomethylene)indanone))-5,5,11,11tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3d:2′,3′d′]sindaceno[1,2b:5,6b′]dithiophene) (as shown in Fig. 1), which exhibited PCE up to 11.21% with PBDB-T (poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))]) as the donor. Since then, numerous studies have reported the excellent performance of ITIC and its derivatives in OSCs,20–24 which prompts ITIC as a type of star acceptors.

Moreover, under the same condition, in the experiment conducted by Hou et al., surprisingly, the device based on PC71BM ([6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester) (Fig. 1) exhibited the PCE of only 7.45%,28 which was much lower than that based on ITIC. On comparing with the relevant experimental parameters (i.e. open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current density, and fill factor), we found that the short-circuit current density (Jsc) in the two systems varied significantly, which could lead to the difference in their PCE. Moreover, one of the key factors which influence Jsc in the OSCs is the interface charge separation process.33 Therefore, for the PBDB-T/ITIC and PBDB-T/PC71BM interface systems, a systematic and comprehensive theoretical comparison is necessary since it can provide a useful insight to understand the detailed differences and the electron processes at the donor/acceptor interface.
Since the interface between the electron donor and the acceptor, where the excitons are separated into free charges, is critical to the OSC, we primarily focus on the electron process at the interface in this study with the aim to find the differences and discuss what might be the main reasons for the differences between the two systems (PBDB-T/ITIC and PBDB-T/PC71BM). In this study, the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the BHJ blends were carried out to obtain the reasonable D/A interfacial models. The density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) were employed to probe the charge separation/recombination (CS/CR) processes at the interface. We expected to find out the determined factors for the superior performance of the ITIC as the acceptor in the OSCs and facilitate the future designs of non-fullerene acceptors.
Computational methods
Molecular dynamics simulations details
The MD simulations on the BHJ interfaces were performed using the GROMACS software package.34 The force field for the ITIC system was derived from the general AMBER force field (GAFF),35 which is a well-established force field for organic small molecules. To generate the force field parameters, atomic partial charges of the molecules were obtained by the restricted electrostatic potential (RESP) fitting method36,37 using a Hartree–Fock level of theory with a 6-31G(d) basis set and the RESP calculations were carried out with the AMBER software. The MD simulation on the PC71BM system was performed using the Optimized Potentials for Liquid Simulations (OPLS-AA) force field,38,39 considering the fact that it has been proven suitable to fullerene.40 Besides, the MD simulation was first performed using canonical (NVT) ensemble and treating electrostatic interactions by Particle-Mesh-Ewald (PME) method. All systems were equilibrated in the NVT ensemble at 300 K using a V-rescale thermostat until the energy of the box reached an equilibrium value (as seen in Fig. S3 in the ESI†). Then, we performed the isothermal–isobaric (NPT) ensembles with an integration time step of 2 fs using the leap-frog algorithm.
The pressure was maintained at 1 bar using a Parrinello–Rahman barostat41 and the temperature was kept constant at 300 K. Then, the systems reached an equalization (Fig. S4 in ESI†) after 10 ns simulation with 0.12 nm spacing for the Fourier grid. The initial and final configurations of the MD simulation for the PBDB-T/ITIC BHJ blend are shown in Fig. 2(a and b) and Fig. S1(a and b) (ESI†).

Density functional theory calculations
Some typical interface models displaying good π–π stacking were extracted from the final mixed molecular clusters obtained by the MD simulation; then, they were further optimized using the quantum mechanical/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) method. Herein, the mechanical embedding scheme, which includes van der Waals, was used during the QM/MM calculation.42–47 The selected models are presented in Fig. S2 in ESI.† The B3LYP functional with a basis set 6-31G(d,p) for the QM part and the Universal Force Field (UFF) for the MM part were adopted. Then, the TDDFT calculation at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level, which has been demonstrated to give a reasonable estimation of the excitation energy of the interface,48,49 was performed. Moreover, the ground state and cationic state energies of the molecules were also calculated at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level to maintain consistency with the energy calculations. The charge density difference (CDD) maps were plotted according to the electron transition information provided by Multiwfn 3.3.8.50 All of the quantum chemical calculations were carried out using the Gaussian 09 software package.51
Although numerous mechanisms about how the charge separation is generated at the photovoltaic interface from coherent to inherent have been proposed,52–56 the inherent hopping mechanism is always considered as the important one, where the charge transfer rate can be calculated by Marcus theory57 in the semi-classical limit. (1)where VDA is the electronic coupling between the donor and the acceptor, λ is the reorganization energy, T is the temperature (300 K), and ΔG is the Gibbs free energy change for the corresponding charge transfer processes. For two different processes, namely, the charge separation and recombination, two different methods were employed to evaluate the electron coupling. For the charge separation from the FE state to the CT1 states, the site energy corrected method, detailed in ESI,† was adopted since the LUMOs of the donor and the acceptor could be considered as the FE and CT1 states, respectively. It was performed in the ADF program with the PW91 function and the TZP basis set as many studies performed.58,59 Furthermore, for the charge recombination process from the CT1 to the ground state, the generalized Mulliken–Hush (GMH) model was used due to its acceptable reasonability in the estimation of the electronic coupling between the ground state and the excited state.60,61 It can be observed that the rate reached the maximum when ΔG was equal to λ. In the normal region, the rate was smaller when λ > |ΔG|, but the converse results appeared in the inverted region.2 The detailed calculations of the reorganization energy, the Gibbs free energy change, and the electronic coupling, which have been employed in our previous study,62,63 are presented in ESI.†
Results and discussion
The D/A interface models
Among the theoretical studies on the photovoltaic interface, building a simple donor/acceptor interface model with a distance of 3.5 Å between two molecules is common,64,65 but it may not be consistent with the practical BHJ active layer.
Herein, in order to make our interface models more reasonable, we first carried out the MD simulation40 as described in Section 2.1 to obtain the morphology of the PBDB-T/acceptor in the BHJ blends. The initial and final cluster morphologies are shown in Fig. 2(a and b) and Fig. S1(a and b) (ESI†). The plot of the potential energy versus the simulation time for the BHJ blends is presented in Fig. S3 and S4 (ESI†), which indicates the systems reaching an equilibrium state. Then, from the final cluster model, we chose some typical interface models, whose separation distance between the donor and the acceptor is within 4 Å and the intermolecular packing is with a good π–π stacking, in which the models make dominant contribution to the electron transfer at the interface since they have a great influence on the key parameters in the Marcus equation, such as the electronic coupling and the distribution of charge transfer states. (In order to provide further evidence for our selection according to the geometry parameters, an interface model (PBDB-T/PC71BM-style 5), in which PC71BM is arranged on the outer side (9 Å) of the PBDB-T skeleton as shown in Fig. S5, S6 and Table S1 (ESI†), was added for comparison. It will manifest the reasonability of the selection of typical interface models.) Finally, the geometries of these interface models and their surrounding environments were re-optimized using the QM/MM method with a mechanical embedding scheme (Fig. S2 in ESI†). The ultimate interface model geometries of the PBDB-T-acceptor for the quantum mechanical part are shown in Fig. 3. In the following section, we take style 1 of two systems as an example to analyze the interface processes.

Charge transfer states
During the photocurrent generation process, as the intermediate state between the Frenkel exciton (FE) state and the charge separation state, the charge transfer (CT) states are significantly important to the free electron/hole generation at the donor/acceptor interface. They either split into free charges or geminately recombine, determining the charge separation efficiency of the OSC. Accordingly, it is necessary to find and analyze the CT states of two systems to evaluate their efficiency. We quantified all of the CT states for style 1 by judging the charge density difference (CDD) maps of 30 excited states relative to the ground state for each system, which are depicted in Fig. S7 and S8 (ESI†). It can be observed that some states exhibit the entire electron transfer from the donor PBDB-T to the acceptor moiety after the excitation and some of these present the hybrid transition owning to both single molecule excitation and CT characters. Clearly, the lowest CT states of the PBDB-T/ITIC and PBDB-T/PC71BM interface model (style 1) are S2 and S11, respectively. In addition, S2, S5, S10, S20, and S24 are also the entire CT states and S8, S21, S22, and S23 are the hybrid CT states for the PBDB-T/ITIC interface. Moreover, for the PBDB-T/PC71BM interface, S12, S21, and S24 are the entire CT states. The CDD maps of all entire CT states are presented in Fig. 4 and 5 for two systems. Moreover, it can be seen on the whole that the PBDB-T/ITIC interface has more CT states than those of the PBDB-T/PC71BM interface, which gives an indication that ITIC could match with PBDB-T better than PC71BM. In addition, the CT states of other styles (style 2–4) for these two types of interfaces were also identified according to the same standard, which are depicted in Fig. S9–S14 in ESI.† They all present the same conclusion with style 1 that the PBDB-T/ITIC interface can generate more CT states than the PBDB-T/PC71BM interface, suggesting more chances to separate charges.

The discussion on the Frenkel exciton state and CT state
The role of the CT states generated after the charge transfer at the interface is still under dispute until now.66 However, as the intermediate state between the FE state and the charge separation state, they really determine the number of free charges generated.67 Therefore, we present a detailed discussion on the relative position of the CT states to the FE states its influence on charge separation. In order to consider the effect of environmental polarization, these excited states were calculated using the QM/MM method. In addition, the energetic considerations are based on the ground state geometry, considering much slower geometry reorganization than electron transition (or transfer) according to the Frank-Condon principle. The first thing we need to do is to classify the excited states, which are assigned to either the CT state which manifests the charge transfer between the donor and the acceptor or the FE state with a localized excitation on the donor (acceptor). Except for the CDD map, we also calculated the charge transfer distance (lCT) and the transferred charge values (qCT) of the excited states using Multiwfn software52 for both interfaces (style 1) to provide a quantitative identification of the excitonic or the CT state. The results presented in Tables S2 and S3 (ESI†) show that the lCT and qCT values of the CT states are much larger than those of the FE states for both interface systems, which, on one hand, illustrates the strong charge transfer character of the CT state and on the other hand, validates our identification in terms of the CDD maps. The corresponding excitation energy alignments, oscillator strengths (f) and CDD maps of the FE and CT states for two systems are shown in Fig. 6 and 7, respectively. Herein, FE1 and FE2 represent the localized excitation on the donor or the acceptor, and CT1, CT2etc. are respectively the charge transfer excitation. For the PBDB-T/ITIC interface (style 1), the CT1–CT5 states correspond to S2, S5, S10, S20 and S24, respectively, and the FE1 and FE2 states correspond to S1 and S4, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6 and Table S4 (ESI†), the energies of FE1 and FE2 for PBDB-T/ITIC are 2.2926 and 2.8610 eV, respectively. The energy of FE1 is lower than that of FE2. On one hand, the FE1 state possesses much higher oscillator strength (f = 2.5249) than that of the FE2 (f = 0.7593) state, indicating more favourable excitation of the acceptor ITIC than the donor and easier realization of the charge separation through the hole transfer from the acceptor to the donor. On the other hand, the FE2 state lies higher than the CT1 state for the PBDB-T/ITIC interface, suggesting more advantageous charge transfer from FE to the CT1 state, which is common in numerous prominent OSCs such as P3HT/PCBM. For the PBDB-T/PC71BM interface (style 1), the FE1, FE2, and CT1–CT3 states correspond to S11, S26, S12, S21 and S24, respectively. We can observe that the oscillator strength of the FE1 state is also higher than that of the FE2 state, but they denote a different excitation occurring at the donor and the acceptor. The FE1 state arises from the localized excitation of the donor PBDB-T. Hence, it could indicate that for the PBDB-T/PC71BM interface, the charge separation through the electron transfer is more favourable because of the stronger photon-absorption of the donor than the acceptor. Furthermore unfortunately, the FE1 state lies lower than CT1 state, which is disadvantageous for the electron transfer from FE to CT1 state.

 Fig. 7  Excitation energies, corresponding oscillator strengths, and charge density difference maps of Frenkel excitons (based on donor or acceptor) and the CT states for the PBDB-T/PC71BM interface (style 1). 
By comparing these two systems, we obtain the following conclusions: (i) the PBDB-T/ITIC interface is more effective to form the FE states, particularly for the excitation of this special acceptor ITIC since the FE states of the PBDB-T/ITIC interface exhibit much larger oscillator strengths than those of the PBDB-T/PC71BM interface and (ii) the PBDB-T/ITIC interface is more likely to obtain the CT states by a direct optical excitation; thus, it could possess more chances of charge separation since the oscillator strength of some CT states of the PBDB-T/ITIC interface are larger than those of the PBDB-T/PC71BM interface. Therefore, the PBDB-T/ITIC interface exhibits more favourable exciton dissociation than the PBDB-T/PC71BM interface from the viewpoint of the formation of the FE and CT states.
In addition, the two systems show interesting differences in the energy level alignment, which could induce their different charge separation mechanisms, thus influencing the efficiency. As shown in Fig. 8, it is acceptable that the easier charge separation path corresponds to the higher FE state relative to the CT1 state, while the difficult charge separation path corresponds to the lower FE state than the CT1 state. Comparing these two interface models, we can conclude that the position of the FE state above the CT1 state with a large oscillator strength in the PBDB-T/ITIC interface can promote its effective electron separation from the FE state to the CT1 state, while it would be prohibitively difficult to form the CT1 state through the FE state for the PBDB-T/PC71BM interface due to a lower energy of the FE state than the CT1 state. Therefore, the favourable relative position of the FE to the CT1 state for the PBDB-T/ITIC interface could be one of the reasons for the prominent performance of the ITIC acceptor in OSCs. In conclusion, more favourable alignment of energy levels, more effective formation of the FE states and more chances to generate the CT states for the PBDB-T/ITIC interface than the PBDB-T/PC71BM interface manifest the better charge dissociation performance of the former. It should be noted that the energy level distributions of the FE and CT states are determined by the selections of the donor and the acceptor together with their match. Thus, ITIC matches better with PBDB-T than PC71BM from this viewpoint.

Charge separation and recombination
The exciton dissociation at the photovoltaic interface generally contains two processes, namely, the charge separation from the neutral FE state to the CT state and the charge recombination from the CT state to the ground state, which can be characterized by their rates. According to the Marcus theory, it is important to evaluate the relevant parameters, such as the electronic coupling (VD/A), reorganization energy (λ), and the Gibbs free energy (ΔG) before obtaining the charge separation and recombination rates. In our previous study, the reasonability and practicability of our calculation strategy were proved63,64 and the additional computational details are displayed in ESI.† According to the methods provided in ESI,† we calculated the electronic coupling values for the charge separation and recombination processes at these two interface models (style 1) and presented the results in Table 1. For the charge separation process, the value of VCS between the FE and CT1 states for the PBDB-T/ITIC and PBDB-T/PC71BM interfaces are 0.0059 and 0.0037 eV, respectively. For the charge recombination process, the corresponding VCR between the CT1 state and the ground state for the PBDB-T/ITIC and PBDB-T/PC71BM interfaces are 0.5549 and 0.2669 eV, respectively. It is clearly observed that the electronic coupling values of the PBDB-T/ITIC interface are larger than those of the PBDB-T/PC71BM interface with regards to the charge separation or the recombination process, which is speculated to closely connect with the molecular structure characteristics. Compared with the spherical structure of PC71BM, the good planarity of the skeleton of ITIC is beneficial to the formation of the large-area π–π interactions with PBDB-T. Consequently, the PBDB-T/ITIC interface could possess higher rates in term of Marcus formula (eqn (1)) since the rate is proportional to the square of electronic coupling. We note that the much smaller electronic coupling between the FE and CT1 states than that between the CT1 and ground states could be ascribed to the larger overlap between the ground state and the excited state wave functions and it is not considered to result from the computational artifact, which was further demonstrated by an example of the TTF and TCNQ interface in ESI.†

Reorganization energy (λ) is another important parameter that determines the final rate, which consists of two parts: inner reorganization energy (λi) and outer reorganization energy (λs). The inner reorganization energy primarily originates from the geometrical changes of the donor and the acceptor in the composite, whereas the outer reorganization energy primarily associates with the change brought by the electronic and nuclear polarization (relaxation) of the surrounding medium during the charge transfer process. According to eqn (S7)–(S13) (ESI†), we evaluated the reorganization energies for two systems during the CS and CR processes, (λCS and λCR) and summarized them in Table 1. We can observe that different interface systems possess different reorganization energies due to their different geometrical relaxations contributed by the acceptor. The differences between the two systems for the outer reorganization energy are very small (0.24 and 0.26 eV). Therefore, the inner reorganization energy is the main reason for the difference in the total reorganization energy. The smaller separation and recombination reorganization energies in the electron transfer process for PBDB-T/PC71BM are rationalized by the fact that both geometries of PBDB-T and PC71BM have smaller geometrical change from D*A to D+A− states.
In fact, except for the electronic coupling and reorganization energy, the Gibbs free energy is also tightly connected with the final rates. The calculated Gibbs free energies (ΔGCS and ΔGCR) using eqn (S4)–(S6) (ESI†) are listed in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, the negative value indicates that the charge transfer processes are a thermodynamically favorable process. The Gibbs free energies for the CS process are in order of ITIC > PC71BM, while the Gibbs free energies for the CR process have the opposite trend. According to the definition of ΔG shown in eqn (S4) and (S5) (ESI†), we speculated that the differences in ΔG are primarily contributed by the change of HOMO and LUMO in the acceptors since we used the orbital energy levels to estimate the value of EEA(A) and EIP(A). Here, ITIC has a higher LUMO energy level than PC71BM, which can lead to the low absolute value of ΔGCS and the high absolute value of ΔGCR. In Marcus formula, the sum of reorganization energy and Gibbs free energy is located in the exponential function, thus we considered them together. For the PBDB-T/ITIC interface, the absolute values of ΔGCS + λCS and ΔGCR + λCR are 0.311 and 1.096, respectively, while the corresponding absolute values for the PBDB-T/PC71BM interface are 0.592, and 0.981, respectively, indicating that the absolute value of ΔGCS + λCS is smaller for the PBDB-T/ITIC interface, which could result in the maximal CS rate in the electron transfer process.
Finally, we calculated the charge separation/recombination rates (kCS and kCR) for these two interface systems and presented the results of style 1 in Table 1. For the PBDB-T/ITIC interface (style 1), the kCS and kCR values are 1.44 × 1011 and 5.91 × 104 s−1, respectively. For the PBDB-T/PC71BM interface, kCS and kCR are 2.43 × 108 and 2.19 × 104, respectively. Thus, for the PBDB-T/ITIC interface, although kCR is similar to that of the PBDB-T/PC71BM interface, its kCS is 3 orders of magnitude larger than that of the latter, which illustrates its much higher efficiency of the charge separation. Hence, we conclude that the PBDB-T/ITIC interface has the advantage in the respect of the interface parameters compared with the PBDB-T/PC71BM interface.
Moreover, we simulated other style models for the PBDB-T/ITIC and PBDB-T/PC71BM interface systems. The corresponding parameters and the final rates are listed in Table 2. It is clear from these parameters that the electron couplings significantly change for both systems compared with the changes of other parameters, which is contributed by different relative positions between the donor and the acceptor in different styles. These differences in the electronic couplings induce the change of the final charge transfer and the recombination rates of style 2–4 compared with style 1. Moreover, the results in Table 2 also show that the calculated kCS of the PBDB-T/ITIC interface is larger than the values of the PBDB-T/PC71BM interface. In addition, the ratios between kCS and kCR of the PBDB-T/ITIC interface (style 2–4) are 1–3 orders of magnitude larger than the ones of the PBDB-T/PC71BM interface (style 2–4), which suggests the absolute advantages in the charge separation of the PBDB-T/ITIC interface. Thus, we conclude that the PBDB-T/ITIC interface possesses a higher charge separation efficiency than that of the PBDB-T/PC71BM interface according to the calculated charge separation and recombination rates.

Conclusions
In summary, in order to explore the reason why ITIC as an acceptor in OSCs has a superior performance and better understand the differences between the PBDB-T/ITIC and PBDB-T/PC71BM interfaces, we attempted to conduct the study and analysis of interface characteristics, including the interface CS/CR rate and the relative position of the CT states to the FE states by means of MD and QC method. Through analyzing the charge separation ability in two systems, the PBDB-T/ITIC interface was found to possess the more favorable relative position of the FE and CT1 states and larger oscillator strength of the CT states than those of the PBDB-T/PC71BM interface, which might benefit the charge separation with more channels. Moreover, the estimation of the charge separation/recombination rates of the typical interface models selected from the MD simulation clusters for these two types of interface systems show that although all interface models have similar charge recombination rates, kCR, the charge separation rate, kCS, of the PBDB-T/ITIC interface has 3 orders of magnitude larger than that of the PBDB-T/PC71BM interface, implying that the ITIC system has a better charge separation ability in this respect. As a result, we believe that the reason which causes the differences between PBDB-T/ITIC and PBDB-T/PC71BM is the better match between the donor and the acceptor and the larger kCS for the former.
