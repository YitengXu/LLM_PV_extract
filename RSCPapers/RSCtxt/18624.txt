, Accepted 14th April 2016First published on 15th April 2016AbstractScanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) with an optical fiber was used to rapidly screen M–CdS (M = Cu, Fe, Zn, Co, Ni, Mn and In) photocatalyst arrays for efficient photoelectrochemical reaction. Among the discussed arrays, the spot with the precursor composition In0.2–Cd0.8S showed the highest photocurrent in 0.1 M Na2SO4/Na2SO3 solution under both UV-visible and visible light irradiation. The SECM screening results were also confirmed with bulk photoelectrode studies. The In0.2–Cd0.8S photocatalyst had the hexagonal phase of the wurtzite solid solution structure with an average crystallite size in the range of 13–37 nm. A red shift was observed in the UV-visible absorption spectrum of CdS upon the addition of In. The Mott–Schottky plots showed that the In0.2–Cd0.8S photoelectrode exhibited a flat band potential of −1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The IPCE value at 450 nm radiation for the In0.2–Cd0.8S photocatalyst is 60%, which is three times higher than that of CdS. The superior photocatalytic activity of the In0.2–Cd0.8S photoelectrode is mainly attributed to its high crystallinity, which promotes separation of the photo-induced electrons and holes and also reduces the probability of recombination.
Introduction
Hydrogen (H2) gas as a clean energy carrier that can be photocatalytically generated from water using solar radiation has attracted much research attention. Since Fujishima and Honda reported the photoelectrochemical (PEC) decomposition of water into hydrogen using a TiO2 electrode under UV light irradiation in 1972,1 there have been numerous reports on splitting water using photoelectrodes or photocatalysts. Although many photocatalytic systems based on metal oxides have been reported to be active for water splitting, most of them require ultraviolet (UV) light. However, since nearly half of the incident solar energy on the earth's surface lies in the visible region, it is important to use the entire spectrum of visible light efficiently to realize H2 generation on a mass production scale by photocatalytic water splitting. CdS is an attractive semiconductor due to its low cost, narrow band gap (∼2.42 eV) and high photosensitivity as well as its availability. It has been extensively investigated as a promising visible-light-driven photocatalyst for water splitting.2–4 However, CdS photocatalysts have limitations due to the photocorrosion problem, the facile recombination of electron–hole pairs and the low surface reaction efficiency.5,6 Consequently, the development of new, more stable CdS-based photocatalysts with high photocatalytic activity and energy conversion efficiency is indispensible to increase their potential for practical applications.
Strategies such as composite catalysts with heterojunctions or solid solutions, supporters and co-catalysts are three effective ways for improving the activity and photostability of the CdS photocatalyst.7–15,39 Although Pt, Pd, Au and Rh used as co-catalysts can enhance the hydrogen evolution activity,7–9 the high price of noble metals makes their use impractical for hydrogen manufacture. Supporters, such as carbon nanotubes, graphene and magnetic materials to support CdS can effectively block the aggregation of CdS and improve the stability of CdS photocatalyst.10,11 However, the high cost and complex preparation process limited the applications in supported materials.12 Zhu et al. reported that a bifunctional ternary heterostuctured In2S3/MoS2/CdS composite has high activity and stability under visible light irradiation.13 Xu et al. found that CdS/BiVO4 nanocomposites had a higher rate for degradation of malachite green than the pure photocatalyst under visible light irradiation.14 The graphene–CdS–MoS2 composite was also demonstrated to have high activity and particularly effective anti-photocorrosion ability toward photocatalytic water splitting under visible light irradiation.15 More complex element compositions could yield interesting semiconductors for efficient photoelectrolysis, but the discovery and optimization of many potential photocatalysts is a time-consuming and tedious process. The conventional method of synthesizing and testing samples individually is too slow to examine a broad range of novel materials.
Combinatorial chemistry is the deliberate synthesis and screening of very large numbers of diverse new materials from different combinations of specific building block atoms and molecules.16 McFarland et al.17–19 developed electrochemical deposition systems for high-throughput electrochemical synthesis of tungsten-based mixed-metal oxides and zinc-based metal oxides as photoelectrocatalysts. They used a high-through photoelectrochemical testing system to identify the optimal photoelectrocatalyst. They found that the W–Ni (5–10 at% Ni) mixed oxide had the largest relative zero bias photocurrent, while Zn0.956Co0.044O exhibited a 4-fold improvement over pure ZnO with no external bias.17,18 Ink jet printing was used by Parkinson et al.20–22 to pattern metal oxide precursors onto conductive glass substrates. Metal oxide compositions were formed after subsequent pyrolysis and then were screened for photoelectrolytic activity using a simple scanning laser system. The best photoresponse was obtained from Bi–V–W semiconducting oxide, of nominal stoichiometry Bi14.4V14.4W1.7, which is about 15 times of that of the BiVO4 parent material at 450 nm.21 The screening of new photocatalysts for water oxidation or hydrogen evolution by scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) with an optical fiber has been reported by Bard et al.23–30 In this method, the ultramicroelectrode tip is replaced by an optical fiber connected to a xenon lamp, which illuminates each spot on a photocatalyst array. The photocurrent recorded during the scan at each spot indicates the activity of the photocatalyst. The optimum composition of several metal-doped Fe2O3 and BiVO4-based photocatalysts was found using this approach.23–30 We have successfully used this powerful method to rapidly screen ZnO, ZnS and Zn0.3Cd0.7S-based photocatalyst arrays and demonstrated that Cd0.2–Zn0.8O, Ni0.1–Zn0.9S and Ag0.3–(Zn0.3Cd0.7S)0.7, respectively, are the excellent photocatalysts.31–33 Based on this research, the current study presented aims at developing new CdS-based photocatalysts. To the best of our knowledge, this is no report regarding the evaluation of M–CdS (M = Cu, Fe, Zn, Co, Ni, Mn and In) photocatalyst arrays.
In the present work, seven CdS-based photocatalyst arrays were rapidly screened by SECM with an optical fiber in Na2SO4/Na2SO3 solution. The photocatalytic activity of the spots was measured via photocurrents at the substrate of the array for SO32− and water oxidation. The optimal CdS-based photocatalysts were further characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS), UV-vis spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The photochemical properties of the bulk film photoelectrode were also investigated and compared with pure CdS. Our results not only contribute to the optimization of CdS-based photocatalysts that provide enhanced photocatalytic activity but also provide a method for constructing solid solution materials.
Experimental
Materials and reagents
F-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glasses (3 × 3 × 0.2 cm3, Chang Shuan Electronics Co.) were cut into rectangular plates (1.5 × 3 × 0.2 cm3). FTO glass plates were rinsed thoroughly with acetone, isopropanol and water. The compounds Zn(NO3)2 (Showa), Fe(NO3)3 (Showa), Co(NO3)2 (Showa), Ni(NO3)2 (Showa), CuSO4 (Showa), AgNO3 (Showa), InCl3 (Sigma Aldrich), Cr(NO3)3 (Alfa Aesar), (NH4)6W12O39 (Alfa Aesar), Mn(NO3)2 (Alfa Aesar), CH4N2S (Alfa Aesar), glycerol (J. T. Baker), NaSO4 (Showa) and Na2SO3 (Showa) were all of reagent grade and used as received. Reagent solutions were prepared using DI water.
Preparation of photocatalyst arrays
Precursors were prepared by dissolving 0.1 M of the metal salt and 0.2 M thiourea in water–glycerol solution (3:1) individually. A piezo-based microarray dispenser (CHI model 1550, CH Instruments) was used to deposited the photocatalyst arrays consisting of mixtures of salt solutions on FTO glass plates. The FTO substrate was fixed under the picoliter piezodispenser (MicroJet AB-01-60, MicroFab, Plano, TX), and the position was controlled by XYZ stepping motors in a pre-programmed pattern. The voltage pulse of 100 V was applied to the piezodispenser to expel the desired number of drops of metal precursor solution onto the substrate. The first precursor solutions containing Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mn and In salts, respectively, were first loaded and dispensed in a pre-programmed pattern. The dispenser was then emptied, rinsed thoroughly and refilled with the second precursor solutions of Cd salts. Specific numbers of drops were then dispensed onto the pre-existing pattern. The total number of moles of metal on each photocatalyst spot remained constant. Then the thiourea solution was added onto the pre-existing spots in a fixed volume to maintain a molar ratio of 1 for the cations and anions. The array of photocatalyst mixtures was agitated for 20 min using an agitator to mix each well. The arrays were kept at 200 °C for 12 h under an argon atmosphere using a tube furnace (21100, Barnstead).
Screening of photocatalyst arrays
A PC-controlled CHI model 900C SECM (CHI Instruments, Austin, TX) with an optical fiber was used to carry out screening measurements. The optical fiber (FIA-P200-SR, Ocean Optics) connected to a 150 W xenon lamp (SXE-150, Collimage International Co.) was attached to the tip holder of the SECM. The photocatalyst arrays on an FTO substrate were placed in the SECM cell with its surface exposed at the bottom through an O-ring. A saturated Ag/AgCl electrode and a Pt wire were used as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. A 0.1 M Na2SO3/Na2SO4 solution as a sacrificial donor was used as the electrolyte. The optical fiber was positioned perpendicular to the array surface at a distance of 500 μm and scanned across the surface at 500 μm s−1. The substrate potential was applied at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. A filter with a wavelength of 420 nm was used to block UV light in the visible light illumination experiments. The photocurrent produced during the scan was recorded and displayed as a two-dimensional image.
Preparation and photoelectrochemical measurements of bulk film electrodes
Mixed solutions containing the precursors with a specific composition determined from the array results were prepared by drop-casting method on FTO substrates. The bulk film electrode was then annealed at 200 °C for 12 h. The photoelectrochemical measurements were performed in a three-electrode cell with a bulk film electrode (1.5 × 1.5 cm2) as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode and a Pt strip as the counter electrode. The bulk film photoelectrode was irradiated by a Xe lamp. The photocurrent vs. potential was measured in a 0.1 M Na2SO3/Na2SO4 solution under UV or visible irradiation.
Physicochemical characterization
The composition and surface topography of the In–CdS arrays were determined by an energy dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDX) coupled to a scanning electron microscope (SEM, S-2500, Hitachi Co.). The structure properties of the In–CdS photocatalysts were characterized using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, D8 SSS, Bruker) with Cu Kα radiation. The scanning diffraction angle was in the range from 20 to 80° at a speed of 4° per min, and the observed patterns were identified according to the Power Diffraction File (PCPDFWIN software). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted on a Phi5000 spectroscope (ESCA system, Ulvac-Phi Co.) using a monochromated Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV) operating at 15 kV. Electrochemical impedance analysis was performed in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution using a frequency of 1000 Hz and an AC amplitude of 10 mV at each potential.
Results and discussion
Before SECM screening measurements, linear sweep voltammogram (LSV) curves of CdS electrode with an applied potential in the range of −1.5 to 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 0.1 M Na2SO4/Na2SO3 solution under dark, UV-visible and visible light illumination are reported in Fig. 1. The onset potential was about −0.97 vs. an Ag/AgCl. The CdS electrode exhibits enhanced anodic current under light illumination, indicating it is n-type semiconductor. The stable photocurrents can be obtained in the potential region between −0.5 and 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl. When the applied potential was more positive than 0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl, the current for the CdS electrode increased in the dark due to the splitting of water. Thus, the potential at 0 vs. Ag/AgCl was chosen as the applied potential for further screening and photoelectrochemical measurements.

Screening photocatalyst arrays by SECM
Seven-second elements were introduced (Cu, Fe, Zn, Co, Ni, Mn and In) to improve the photocatalytic activity of CdS. The 11 spots in right two columns in Fig. 2(a) represent compositions from 100% M (M = Cu, Fe, Zn, Co, Ni, Mn and In) to 100% Cd with 10% changes for each successive drop. The first spot in the right column and the fifth spot in the second column were 100% metal sulfide and 100% CdS, respectively. A duplicate in the left two columns was used to evaluate the reproducibility of the dispensing and screening results. The SECM images of the M–Cd–S photocatalyst arrays recorded under UV-vis irradiation in a 0.1 M Na2SO4/Na2SO3 solution at a bias of 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl are shown in Fig. 2(b–h). The sample spots with a higher photocurrent have a dark brown color, while those with a smaller photocurrent are dark green. Several elements exhibit a negative effect on the photoelectrochemical response of CdS. A drop in photocurrent was observed beginning with 10% Cu, Fe, Zn, Co, Ni and Mn. Increasing the atomic ratio of Cu, Fe, Zn, Co, Ni and Mn produced a further decrease of the photocurrent. Among the various second components, only In showed a positive effect on the photocurrent response of CdS, with the addition of 20% In leading to the highest photocurrent in the In–Cd–S array. A duplicate array demonstrated the good reproducibility of the SECM results. The repeatability/reproducibility of the photocurrent of the photocatalyst arrays was verified by three samples with six individual Inx–Zn1−xS arrays. These arrays were prepared by following the same procedure and were screened by SECM with an optical fiber.

The scan rate was 500 μm s−1. 
Fig. 3 shows the average photocurrent of the Inx–Zn1−xS photocatalysts obtained from SECM measurements (inset images) under UV-visible and visible irradiation. Spots prepared with In–Zn–S ratios of 2:8:10 and 1:9:10 displayed higher photocurrent than the other spots both under UV-visible and visible light irradiation. Reproducible photocurrents of the In0.2–Cd0.8S spot were obtained with relative standard deviation (RSD) of 2.4%. Therefore, the In–CdS arrays exhibit good reproducible photocatalytic activity. Since the In0.2–Cd0.8S spot has the highest photocurrent, this photocatalyst was chosen for further study.

Physicochemical characteristics of photocatalysts
SEM images of pure InS, CdS and various Inx–Cd1−xS spots are shown in Fig. 4. The CdS spot displayed spherical grains uniformly distributed (Fig. 4(a)) on the substrate, whereas the InS spot (Fig. 4(f)) displayed a compact film without clear granule boundaries. Upon the addition of In, a combination of plate-like aggregates and small nanoparticles was observed in Fig. 4(b) and (c). After increasing the In addition to 60%, nanoparticles with average diameter of 80 nm are uniformly distributed, as depicted in Fig. 4(d). The In0.8–Cd0.2S spot has obvious cracks on the outer layer, which may be due to the stress (Fig. 4(e)). The inter layer was found to be well crystallized. These results indicate that addition of In3+ to the CdS precursor solution changes the nucleation and the growth of the CdS photocatalyst significantly.

Compositional determinations of the Inx–Zn1−xS array were performed by EDX, as shown in Table 1. The In contents of the spots decreased with decreased concentration of In2+ in the precursor solutions, whereas the Cd contents increased with increased concentration of Cd2+ in the precursor solutions. The amount of S remained almost constant in the Inx–Zn1−xS array. The average atomic ratio of In:Cd:S was close to the nominal composition of the InxCd1−xS array.

The crystal structure of the CdS and In0.2–Cd0.8S photocatalysts was examined by XRD. Fig. 5 illustrates the XRD patterns of the CdS and In0.2–Cd0.8S photocatalysts. The CdS diffractogram displayed three main peaks at 2θ = 26.4, 43.8 and 51.8°, ascribed to diffraction from the (002), (110), and (112) planes of the hexagonal structure, which matches the standard card (JCPDS no. 41-1049). The broad peaks indicate that the pure CdS has a small particle size and is poorly crystallized. For the In0.2–Cd0.8S photocatalysts, some new main peaks loaded at 2θ = 24.8, 28.2, 36.6 and 47.8° appear, which correspond to the (100), (101), (102), and (103) crystal planes of hexagonal phase of the wurtzite CdS structure. No new phase was found. Thus, the addition of 20% In to CdS not only improves the crystallinity of the film but also leads to the formation of a solid solution. In2S3 and CdS merged into a solid solution with homogeneously distributed Cd and In atoms.

The average crystalline size is calculated from the data of Fig. 5 with the use of Scherrer's equation, and the results are listed in Table 2. Both the samples contain nanocrystallites. Compared to the CdS, the In0.2–Cd0.8S photocatalysts have lager grains, with a mean size between 13 and 37 nm. The XRD result demonstrates that the In0.2–Cd0.8S photocatalysts have a polycrystalline wurtzite crystal structure.

XPS measurements were performed to confirm the chemical binding states of the In0.2–Cd0.8S and CdS photocatalysts. Fig. 5 compares of the XPS spectra for the Cd 3d, S 2p and In 3d regions between the In0.2–Cd0.8S and CdS photocatalysts. The binding energies were calibrated by taking the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV as a reference. The Cd 3d XPS spectra are shown in Fig. 6(a). The peak with a binding energy of 405.2 and 411.8 eV can be assigned to the Cd 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 component of CdS. The data match the binding energy of Cd–S bonds.34 Fig. 6(b) shows the XPS spectra of S 2p. The binding energy of S 2p could be de-convoluted into two peaks. The doublets at 160.8 and 162.0 eV for S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 could be attributed to the S2− of bulk S atoms and to the S2− ions of surface S atoms.35 For the In0.2–Cd0.8S photocatalysts, due to the presence of the In–S chemical bond, the S 2p (2p2/3, 2p1/2) doublets in the chemical state of S2− are shifted to binding energies of 160.6 and 161.8 eV, which are lower than the CdS photocatalysts. The binding energies of In 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 at 445.0 and 452.6 eV (Fig. 6(c)) indicate the oxidation state of In3+.36 This binding energy value of In 3d is higher than that for pure In2S3,37 which could be attributed to the In 5s5p orbital mixing with Cd 5s5p. The XPS study demonstrates the existence of CdS–In3S2 solid solution in the In0.2–Cd0.8S photocatalysts.

The UV-visible absorption spectra of the CdS and In0.2–Cd0.8S photocatalysts are compared in Fig. 7(a). The CdS photocatalysts display strong absorption in the visible region with an absorption edge of 516 nm, whereas In0.2–Cd0.8S photocatalysts absorb light up to 535 nm. The direct optical band gap (Eg) of photocatalysts can be estimated by extrapolation of the linear portion of (hvF(R∞))2 vs. hv plots using the modified Tauc relation,38 
(hvF(R∞))2 = A(hv − Eg)
(1)where hv is the photon energy, F(R∞) is Kubelka–Munk function, which is proportional to the absorption coefficient and A is the band edge constant. The corresponding plots are shown in Fig. 7(b). The intercept on the hv axis determines the direct band gap. The band gap of CdS and In0.2–Cd0.8S can be estimated as 2.4 and 2.3, respectively. Thus In0.2–Cd0.8S solid solution photocatalysts have enhanced light absorption in the visible region.

Photoelectrochemical properties of the bulk film electrode
Bulk In0.2–Cd0.8S and CdS electrodes were prepared to confirm the results observed in the SECM study. Fig. 8(a) and (b) show the current–time transient responses of the In0.2–Cd0.8S and CdS electrodes under chopped UV-visible and visible light illumination in a 0.1 M Na2SO4/Na2SO3 solution at a bias of 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The In0.2–Cd0.8S electrode showed better photoactivity than the CdS electrode under both UV-visible and visible light irradiation. The anode photocurrents of In0.2–Cd0.8S electrode were 1264 and 403 μA at a bias of 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl under UV-visible and visible light illumination, respectively. The photocurrent value obtained at the In0.2–Cd0.8S electrode under visible light illumination was 5.8 times higher than that of the CdS electrode. This data is consistent with the previous screening results (Fig. 2).

The flat-band potential and carrier density of the In0.2–Cd0.8S and CdS electrodes were estimated from Mott–Schottky (MS) measurements performed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The MS plots of the In0.2–Cd0.8S and CdS electrodes (1/C2 vs. E, where C is the space charge capacitance of the semiconductor electrode) at 1000 Hz in the dark are shown in Fig. 9. The positive slopes of the MS plots confirm that the In0.2–Cd0.8S and CdS films were n-type semiconductors.
 Fig. 9  Mott–Schottky plots of the In0.2–Cd0.8S and CdS electrodes in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution (pH = 7) at 1000 Hz under the dark conditions. 
The Efb of the In0.2–Cd0.8S and CdS electrodes, estimated from the intercepts of the MS plots, were about −1.2 and −1.08 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively. The carrier density of the In0.2–Cd0.8S electrode was similar to that of the CdS electrode, as shown in the slope of the MS plots.
The incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements of the In0.2–Cd0.8S and CdS electrodes were performed in a 0.1 M Na2SO4/Na2SO3 solution at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl under monochromatic light irradiation. Fig. 10 shows the IPCE plots of these electrodes over the range of 300–600 nm calculated with the following equation: 
IPCE (%) = 1240 × (iph/λPin) × 100
(2)where iph is the photocurrent (mA), λ is the wavelength (nm) of incident radiation, and Pin is the incident light power intensity on the semiconductor electrode (mW) at the selected wavelength. The In0.2–Cd0.8S electrode showed higher IPCE values relative to the CdS electrode across the entire wavelength range. The IPCE value of the CdS electrode at 450 nm was about 60%, while the CdS electrode had a value of only 20%. The IPCE results indicate that formation of the In0.2–Cd0.8S solid solution photocatalysts improved the photocatalytic efficiency of CdS significantly.

Based on these results, the mechanism involved in the excitation and charge transfer is illustrated in Fig. 11. Under the light irradiation, In0.2–Cd0.8S photocatalyst is excited to generate electrons and holes in the conductive band and valence band, respectively. The photo-induced electrons are easily transferred to the FTO substrate and rapidly transported to the external circuit while the holes react with SO32− and hydroxyl group to produce SO42− and O2. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the In0.2–Cd0.8S solid solution is mainly related to the better crystal structure, greater crystallinity and the superior photo absorption in the visible region than that of pure CdS. The high crystalline quality with fewer defects benefits the separation of the photo-induced electrons and holes and also reduces the probability of recombination.

Conclusions
SECM with an optical fiber was used to screen for potential CdS-based photocatalysts under UV-visible and visible light irradiation. Of the various photocatalyst arrays, the In0.2–Cd0.8S photocatalyst showed the highest photocurrent. The results were confirmed with bulk film studies. XRD and XPS measurements verifying that In0.2–Cd0.8S is a solid solution photocatalyst with hexagonal wurtzite crystal structure. The band gap was estimated to be 2.3 eV. The In0.2–Cd0.8S photoelectrode showed a negative shift of the flat band position of about 0.12 V compared with the CdS electrode. The IPCE value at 450 nm radiation for the In0.2–Cd0.8S photocatalysts is 60%, which is three time higher than that of the CdS. The high photocatalytic activity of In0.2–Cd0.8S photocatalysts may be because the high crystalline quality of the wurtzite structure results in effective charge separation between the photo-excited electrons and holes.
