    , Accepted 20th January 2023First published on 20th January 2023AbstractThe photoelectrochemical (PEC) reduction of CO2 into organic chemicals on the semiconductor is considered a feasible plan to address the global energy crisis and climate warming. Herein, the heterojunctions NiMoO4/ZnO-x are designed and synthesized. The nanosheets of NiMoO4 have excellent absorption of photons and benefit the C–C coupling to C2 compounds. The ZnO/C core fabricated from MOF rich in CN species harvests light to generate a lot of thermal electrons assisting CO2 reduction. Benefitting from its unique chemical properties and structure, the as-prepared NiMoO4/ZnO-3 heterojunction exhibited impressive performance in CO2 reduction, yielding oxygenated chemicals with 72.6% selectivity for C2 products at a rate of 29.2 μM cm−2 h−1. The formation rate under photoelectrochemical conduction is three times that of photocatalysis plus electrocatalysis, showing a strong synergetic effect of photo- and electro-catalysis. The isotopic labeling experiments of 13CO2 verified that the products are derived from CO2 and water. Finally, a new catalytic mechanism with bimetallic centers is proposed firstly to explain the reaction pathways with high selectivity of C2 chemicals. The important intermediates and the C–C coupling via Ni–Mo bicentre are proven by density-functional theory (DFT) calculations and verified by operando Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry. On the other hand, the effect of thermal electrons is investigated as well.
Introduction
Rapid increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations have led to global climate change, which is one of the most urgent agendas to be addressed. To mitigate this issue, various direct CO2-utilization techniques have been studied to achieve an artificial carbon-neutral and carbon cycle.1,2 The photoelectrochemical (PEC) reduction of CO2 would be an essential aspect in CO2-utilization technologies, which integrates the advantages of both photocatalysis (PC)3–10 and electrocatalysis (EC)11–17 for CO2 reduction to promote the separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron–holes resulting in the high quantum efficiency of light.18–22 The energetic photoelectrons could overcome the high overpotential of the electrochemical process and the electrons from the external circuit could inhibit the recombination of photoelectrons and holes.23–27
Photoelectrochemical reduction of CO2 in aqueous solution using semiconductor GaP as a catalyst was firstly reported by Halmann in 1978.28 After decades of development, diverse semiconductor catalysts TiO2,29,30 CdS,31 GaN,32 Cu2O,33 g-C3N4,34 and so on,35–40 have been investigated. As a promising material, ZnO has been the hotspot in photocatalytic applications due to its unique optic properties, nontoxicity, low cost, and high electron mobility. ZnO is emerging as an alternative n-type semiconductor in CO2 reduction, as described in our previous report and the literature.41–44 However, ZnO has some drawbacks, such as a large band gap of 3.2 eV limiting the harvesting of visible light and severe photocorrosion.45,46
NiMoO4 is a stable monoclinic crystal structure and easy to obtain. The nickel molybdate is a p-type semiconductor with a layered structure and proper band-gap (2.54–2.9 eV).47,48 It is a good material with superior conductivity for building a p–n heterojunction with an n-type semiconductor. Nevertheless, it has been rarely studied in photocatalysis49 and electrocatalysis and needs to be further explored and developed in photoelectrocatalytic CO2 reduction.
Herein, a core–shell structure heterojunction composed of ZnO as the core and NiMoO4 nanosheets as the shell was designed and fabricated, in which, introducing C and N elements into the lattice of ZnO would overcome the photocorrosion and ameliorate the photoelectrical properties of ZnO. These new materials were used as a photocathode in the PEC cell of NiMoO4/ZnO‖SCE (standard calomel electrode)‖BiVO4 for CO2 reduction. Benefitting from the synergistic effect of PC and EC, the optimized NiMoO4/ZnO-3 heterojunction material revealed outstanding activity under simulated sunlight irradiation and external power. The thermal effect was studied as well and showed positive correlation property to catalytic activity. This work is expected to provide new insights into the design and preparation of more efficient catalysts for CO2 reduction under PEC and thermal conditions.
Experimental

DMSO, potassium bicarbonate, 2-methylimidazole, urea, nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O), sodium molybdate dihydrate (Na2MoO4·2H2O), zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O), and sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Deuterium oxide (D2O) was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. Other chemicals and reagents were of analytical grades and commercial products were used in the experiments without further purification.
Synthesis of photocathodes

Synthesis of ZIF-8. 
According to the reported method,3,50 12 mmol 2-methylimidazole solution of 25 mL methanol was added to a 3.0 mmol Zn(NO3)2·6H2O solution of methanol under vigorous stirring for 20 min. The cloudy mixture solution was continuously stirred for 24 h at room temperature. The white solid ZIF-8 was obtained after centrifugation, washed with ethanol three times, and dried in an oven at 60 °C, overnight.


Synthesis of core ZnO/C. 
The powder of ZIF-8 was transferred into a ceramic boat and placed in a tube furnace. The sample was heated to 600 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 and kept for 3 h under argon protection and then naturally cooled to 390 °C and kept for 0.5 h under air. Finally, the sample was naturally cooled to room temperature. The obtained material was directly used in the next step without further treatment.


Synthesis of core–shell NiMoO4/ZnO-x heterojunctions. 
The reaction solution was prepared by dissolving 14.5 mg of Na2MoO4·2H2O, 12 mg Ni(NO3)2·H2O, and 180 mg urea in 60 mL DI water. Then, the 50 mg ZnO/C sample and the solution were added to a 100 mL stainless steel autoclave with a Teflon liner. After 6 h of the solvothermal reaction under 160 °C, the reactor was cooled to room temperature. The as-prepared sample, called NiMoO4/ZnO-1, was filtered and washed with distilled water and further dried at 60 °C in vacuo oven. Other samples were prepared with different quantities of Na2MoO4·2H2O (29, 56, 112, 141 mg) and Ni(NO3)2·H2O (24, 48, 96, 120 mg) were named NiMoO4/ZnO-2, NiMoO4/ZnO-3, NiMoO4/ZnO-4, and NiMoO4/ZnO-5, respectively.


Preparation of photocathodes. 
The working electrode was prepared as follows: 5 mg of powdered core–shell NiMoO4/ZnO-x catalysts was dispersed in a solution of 450 μL isopropyl alcohol and 50 μL of naphthol. The mixture was treated to ultrasound for 30 min. Then, the slurry was coated onto carbon paper and dried to obtain an electrode.


The photoelectrocatalysis experiment. 
The photoelectrocatalysis experiments were carried out in 0.1 M Na2SO3 under irradiation of 100 mW cm−2 Xe lamp and external potential. The prepared photocathode, BiVO4, and SCE served as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively. Prior to measurements, the electrolyte was bubbled with pure CO2 (99.999%) or 13CO2 (99.9%) for 30 min till saturation. A 300 W Xe lamp (XD350, Perfect Light, China) served as simulated sunlight. The gas phase composition was analyzed by GC, and the liquid phase composition was analyzed by 1H NMR using D2O as the internal standard and DMSO as an integration standard.

Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the materials were recorded on an X'Pert PRO diffractometer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on an Apreo S instrument. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and corresponding energy disperse spectroscopy (EDS) mapping were carried out on FEI Talos F200s under the accelerating voltage of 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on the samples was performed using a VG Scientific ESCALB210-XPS photoelectron spectrometer equipped with the Mg Kα X-ray resource. For the core-level spectra, the C 1s feature located at 284.6 eV was used to calibrate the binding energy. The optical absorption properties of the electrodes were studied using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2600, Shimadzu). 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian AM-400 spectrometer using D2O and DMSO as internal standards. The gas chromatograph (GC) was performed using a Varian CP-3800 GC instrument equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used for the analysis of the gaseous products. A solar simulator PLS-SXE300C (Perfect Light solar simulator) was used as a light source. A CHI660E electrochemical workstation was used to study different parameters of experiments. Light density of solar simulator was calibrated with an optical density meter provided by Photoelectric Instrument Factory of Beijing Normal University, Model FZ-A. The operando FTIR spectra were conducted on a TENDOR27 spectrometer (Bruker).
Results and discussion
Despite being economy and with good properties, ZnO has a drawback of photocorrosion like in many semiconductors. Two the following strategies were used to address this issue: penetrating carbon elements into the lattice of ZnO by annealing the MOFs precursor, and in situ growing NiMoO4 onto the surface of ZnO to fabricate a heterojunction for protection.
The fabrication process is illustrated in Fig. 1a. The initial ZIF-8 exhibited a uniform rhombododecahedral shape with an average size of 450 nm (Fig. 1b). After pyrolysis at 600 °C under the Ar atmosphere and oxidation at 390 °C under the air atmosphere, ZIF-8 was transformed into a ZnO/C dodecahedron with rough surfaces and a diameter of 450 nm (Fig. 1c). The flower-like NiMoO4 nanosheets were uniformly attached on the surface of the ZnO/C dodecahedron and form nanosheet arrays after the hydrothermal reaction (Fig. 1d and S1†). The growth of NiMoO4 nanosheets results in large numbers of hierarchical structures, which could effectively improve the specific surface area of the material and be further conducive to ion transport and diffusion. In addition, the average diameter of the composite is about 800 nm, which is 1.7 times that of a ZnO dodecahedron.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-prepared NiMoO4/ZnO-x samples were assigned to the hexagonal ZnO (Fig. S2,† JCPDF 03-08888) and NiMoO4 (JCPDF 45-0142). Compared with ZnO, the diffraction peak of ZnO/C was slightly shifted to the left, thus the lattice parameters became bigger, indicating that C and N elements were doped into the lattice of ZnO (Fig. S2a and b†). When the content of NiMoO4 increased, the intensity of NiMoO4 diffraction peaks at 27.6 and 33.6° gradually increased and the intensity of ZnO diffraction peaks decreased, indicating the successful growth of NiMoO4 on the surface of ZnO (Fig. S2c†). It can be found from XRD that with the increase of the NiMoO4 content, the main diffraction peak of ZnO moves to the left, indicating that Mo and Ni elements enter the lattice of ZnO to increase the lattice parameter and the interplanar spacing larger (Fig. S2d†).
The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 2a) also provided solid evidence for the growth process of NiMoO4/ZnO-x core–shell structure with the ultrathin NiMoO4 nanosheets as the shell layer and ZnO dodecahedron as the core part. The high-resolution TEM image of NiMoO4/ZnO-3 (Fig. 2b) revealed the lattice fringe spacing of 0.247 nm and 0.264 nm, corresponding to the (100) plane of ZnO and (111) plane of NiMoO4, which is consistent with the XRD results. A clear interface was found between ZnO and NiMoO4, suggesting the formation of a NiMoO4/ZnO heterojunction. In addition, the HAADF-STEM image and EDS mapping of NiMoO4/ZnO-3 (Fig. 2c) further confirmed the successful fabrication of NiMoO4/ZnO core–shell nanostructure.

The chemical composition and the valence state of the prepared ZnO/C, NiMoO4, and NiMoO4/ZnO-3 catalysts were further revealed from the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) (Fig. S3†). The fine XPS spectra of Zn 2p can be split into four peaks at 1021.7, 1022.8 and 1044.7, 1045.1 eV, corresponding to Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2, respectively (Fig. S3b†).51 The detected Zn0 species may result from the low oxidation temperature and short oxidation time. Moreover, the Zn2+ species of the NiMoO4/ZnO-3 heterojunction exhibited a negative energy shift compared with that of ZnO/C. In contrast, the high-resolution Mo 3d spectra of the NiMoO4/ZnO-3 heterojunction showed a positive shift in binding energy compared with that of NiMoO4 (Fig. S3c†).52 It indicates that there is a strong interaction between NiMoO4 and ZnO. For the high-resolution Ni 2p spectrum of NiMoO4/ZnO-3 (Fig. S3d†), two peaks at 856.1 and 873.7 eV with a spin–orbital splitting of 17.6 correspond to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 of Ni2+, Ni3+, respectively.52 As seen in Fig. S4a,† the C 1s spectrum shows three peaks at 284.6, 285.7, and 288.6 eV, representing the C–C, C–N, and C–O/CO, respectively.53 A new peak at 283.2 eV is attributed to the formation of C–Zn bonds, which proved that C was doped into the ZnO lattice. The fine XPS spectra of N 1s (Fig. S4b†) can be deconvoluted into two peaks centered at around 398.3, and 402.0 eV, corresponding to pyridinic-N and graphitic-N, respectively.54,55 It is obvious that pyridinic-N is dominant in ZnO/C. The formation of N–Zn bonds resulted in a new peak of 395.1 eV, which proved that N was doped into the ZnO lattice. Raman spectra (Fig. S4c†) of all samples showed two vibrational bands centered at 1317 cm−1 (D band) and 1560 cm−1 (G band), which corresponded to the disordered and graphitic carbon structure, respectively. The other two peaks at 1212 and 1416 cm−1 represent D−νZnO and D+νZnO, respectively, indicating the tight contact of ZnO with C material and the occupation of C or N into the lattice of ZnO.
The separation of photoelectron–hole pairs is the key parameter in determining the photoelectrocatalytic performance. The low intensity of photoluminescence (PL) spectra is related to the high efficiency of separation for photoelectron–hole pairs. As can be seen in Fig. S5,† the PL spectrum of NiMoO4 display a strong emission peak at around 380 nm, and NiMoO4/ZnO-x materials have only about 5–10% intensity in comparison with NiMoO4, suggesting that the recombination of photoelectron–hole pairs is obviously suppressed in the heterojunction and the electrons transfer quickly on the NiMoO4/ZnO heterojunction.
The C-doping into the lattice of ZnO is not only to enhance the stability of the catalysts, but also to provide thermal electrons for boosting the catalytic performance. To verify this effect, the local thermal field was measured by an infrared thermal camera system under constant light irradiation. The thermal currents caused by the change in environment temperature were carefully determined in dark. The linear plot of thermal current density versus temperature is shown in Fig. S6,† exhibiting that the higher temperature, the more thermal electrons. The temperature on the surface of the photocathode rises rapidly under irradiation of 100 mW cm−2, reaching the highest temperature in about 6 minutes, as shown in Fig. 3a and b, and inset, in which, the temperature distributions of the samples on three-dimension are depicted in Fig. 3c–e, and S7–S9.† As the photoelectrons and electrons of external circuit, thermal electrons can be used in our reaction system to promotes CO2 reduction.

The Mott–Schottky plots suggest that the heterojunction is a typical p–n heterojunction (Fig. 4a and S10†). The flat band potentials (Efb) of the samples were determined to be around −1.2 V vs. NHE (normal hydrogen electrode) that are higher than the needed potential of −0.61 V vs. NHE for formic acid, −0.38 V vs. NHE for methanol, and −0.33 V vs. NHE for ethanol, which provides enough power to reduce CO2. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of the cell NiMoO4/ZnO-x|SCE|BiVO4 in aqueous 0.1 M Na2SO3 electrolyte under light or dark conditions were obtained and shown in Fig. 4b. The results exhibit an extremely low onset potential, which proved the remarkable intrinsic activity of NiMoO4/ZnO-x heterojunction. The high current density of 7 mA cm−2 could be obtained over NiMoO4/ZnO-3 at −0.8 V vs. SCE, which was twenty times that of ZnO/C. The transient photocurrent of the six photocathodes is illustrated in Fig. 4c. It can be found that NiMoO4/ZnO-x photocathodes have better photoresponse in comparison with the ZnO/C electrode. The NiMoO4/ZnO-3 electrode shows the highest photocurrent value among the four electrodes. To further reveal the charge carrier dynamics involved in the working electrode. Nyquist plots from EIS tests over the samples were also determined. As shown in Fig. 4d, the smallest semicircle diameter of NiMoO4/ZnO-3 indicates the best electron transfer/mobility dynamics. These results suggest that the surface-anchored NiMoO4 would augment the charge transformation in the PEC cell, resulting in better photoelectrochemical performance in CO2 reduction.

The PEC reduction of CO2 was studied in a three-electrode system in the presence of 0.1 M Na2SO3 electrolyte. The liquid products in the electrolyte were detected and quantified by 1H NMR. The production rates of each component under various conditions are listed in Fig. 5. On the other hand, H2 was the sole product detected by gas chromatography (Fig. S11†). When ZnO/C was used as the photocathode, only formic acid was formed in the CO2 reduction. On the surface of the ZnO semiconductor material, the remaining hydroxyl groups have certain activity for CO2 reduction,58 while the products included mainly C1 chemicals.59 Pyridinic-N in C material can easily adsorb the CO2 molecule due to the basicity, which serves as another reduction site to reduce CO2 to formic acid. When the heterojunctions NiMoO4/ZnO-x were used as photocathodes, the yields of C2 products were evidently increased (Fig. 5a). The highest production rate of the products obtained by NiMoO4/ZnO-3 was up to 29.2 μM cm−2 h−1, which is 5 times higher than that of the NiMoO4 because the better charge transfer channel constructed in the heterojunction is more conducive to supply necessary electrons during CO2 reduction. To investigate the influence of electrolysis potentials, the best electrode NiMoO4/ZnO-3 was investigated in the range from −0.5 V to −0.9 V vs. SCE (Fig. 5b). It is clear to see that the ethanol and ethylene glycol were the major product accompanied by some formic acid as by-products in the liquid phase. The highest formation rate of C2 products reached 29.2 μM h−1 cm−2 at −0.8 V vs. SCE and the selectivity of C2 products approached 72.6%. The interface between ZnO and NiMoO4 formed a p–n heterojunction where the electrons and protons are enriched under irradiation of light, can effectively improve the catalytic activity and selectivity of the catalyst.

The stability and recyclability of photocathodes are important factors to use. Through a long-duration test of 8 h, NiMoO4/ZnO-3 has demonstrated good stability (Fig. S12–S14†). Meanwhile, the products were accumulated from 193 to 754 μM cm−2 in the product accumulation experiment (Fig. 5c). It is found that the number of transferred electrons has a linear relationship with time, which also suggests that the activity of the material is not changed within an 8 hour reaction (Fig. S15†). To better understand the advantages of PEC, the performances of NiMoO4/ZnO-3 under EC and PC conditions were also studied and the data are depicted in Fig. 5d. It is worth noting that the formation rate of C2 products of NiMoO4/ZnO-3 under PEC conditions at −0.8 V vs. SCE is about 3 times that of EC plus PC. The comparison with the NiMoO4-based catalysts reported in the literature is listed in Table 1. It can be seen that the NiMoO4-based catalysts with 1D structure (bar) and 3D structure (particle) have only C1 products. In contrast, our new heterojunction catalysts with the 2D structure (nanosheet) have a powerful ability to generate C2 products with 72.6% selectivity due to the higher indices of the crystal plane of (111) NiMoO4. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report for C2 products in the presence of a NiMoO4 catalyst.

13CO2 isotopic labelling experiments were performed to trace the carbon source. Two peaks at 8.08 and 8.54 ppm are assigned to the proton of the formate coupled by the nuclei of 13C (Fig. S16†).60 The peaks of GC mass spectra at m/z = 17, 32, 45, 47, 63, and 64 were detected and attributed to the OH−, 13CH2OH (13CH313CH2OH), 13CO2, 13CH313CH2O (13CH313CH2OH), HO13CH213CH2O (HO13CH213CH2OH) and HO13CH213CH2OH (Fig. S17†). These results clearly indicate that the carbon source comes from 13CO2.
The adsorption and activation of CO2 molecules on the surface of catalysts play a very important role in photoelectrocatalytic CO2 reduction. To further understand the reaction mechanism, the operando FTIR experiments were set up and carried out. The operando FTIR spectra on NiMoO4/ZnO-3 are recorded and depicted in Fig. 6a, S18 and S19.† The vibration of the carbonyl group in HCOOH is located at 1716 cm−1. The new peaks at 1525, 1396, and 1489 cm−1 are increased along with the extension of the reaction time and ascribed to the *CO2−,61 *OCHO,62 and *OCH2 intermediates of species, respectively. To further confirm these important intermediates, the operando FTIR experiments with D2O were conducted as well, and they showed two intermediates of *OCDO and *OCD2 at 931.8 and 973 cm−1, respectively, due to the reduced mass of C–D groups (Fig. 6b and S20†). On the other hand, the absorption peak of *CO2− and the peaks of b-CO32− were not changed without the deuterium atoms.

The above results and analyses inspired us to propose a new mechanism with an adsorption model of oxygen atoms onto the surface of NiMoO4. Firstly, CO2 molecules are adsorbed simultaneously to the sites of Ni and Mo atoms on the surface of the catalyst. When the intermediate *CO2− combining with protons and electrons in turn, the intermediates *OCHO and *OCH2 could be generated (Fig. 6c). The active *OCHO species combine with proton and electron to produce formic acid. In the case of the species *OCHO, it reacts with two highly active hydrogen atoms (2H+ + 2e−), and a novel *OCH2 species is generated on both the Mo and Ni sites. These neighboring species would easily approach each other to form the *OCH2CH2O* intermediate leading to C2 products (Fig. 6c) (both are O-bound intermediate).
To further identify the role of NiMoO4 in the reduction of CO2 to produce C2 and prove the proposed new mechanism, a density functional theory (DFT) calculation with the VASP program was performed to figure out the free energy on both the Ni and Mo sites of NiMoO4 (Fig. S21 and S22†). The related Gibbs free energies of species and intermediates versus reaction coordinates are illustrated in Fig. 6d and S23.† First, the energy release from the two CO2 molecules to active species of *CO2− on the surface of (111) plane of NiMoO4 is about 0.2 eV. When two protons attack *CO2− species, two species of *OCHO are formed with the release of 3.3 eV of energy. One intermediate of *OCHO on the Ni site accepted the hydrogen atom yielding the *OCH2 intermediate with 7.6 eV energy liberation and another *OCHO intermediate on the Mo site acquired the hydrogen atom to yield the *OCH2 intermediate with 10.2 eV energy liberation. These two active intermediates of *OCH2 on bis-metal centers immediately link together forming a dimer intermediate IV with the release of 18.5 eV of energy, resulting in C2 products with the energy liberation of 24.5 eV for ethyl glycol and of 30.2 eV for ethanol. We reveal that the *OCHO and *OCH2 intermediates are more favorable to carbon–carbon coupling by means of DFT calculations.
Conclusions
In summary, a new heterojunction catalyst NiMoO4/ZnO-x with a 3D core–shell structure was designed and fabricated by the hydrothermal method. The C skeleton material synthesized with ZIF as a template can not only overcome the photo-corrosion of ZnO but also be conducive to improving the electron transport rate. The thermal electrons generated from the new heterojunction materials are more conducive to the photoelectrochemical reduction of CO2. Operando FTIR disclosed that the active species of *OCHO and *OCH2 might be the key intermediates for the formation of C-based chemicals, which were verified by the deuterium isotopic labelling of water. The DFT calculations proved the reasonable mechanism via oxygen coordination, indicating that two sites of Ni and Mo atoms in the plane (111) of lattice play a key role in C–C coupling due to the proper distance. To the best of our knowledge, the C2 chemicals produced by our new heterojunction catalyst under PEC conditions are reported first in the literature. This study provides new insight into the development of bimetallic photoelectrocatalyst for converting CO2 into highly value-added C2+ compounds.
