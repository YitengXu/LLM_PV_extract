    , Accepted 5th November 2018First published on 6th November 2018AbstractRolling up 2D atomic layered materials into 1D nanotubes gives rise to fascinating properties due to their lower dimension, higher anisotropy, and strain effects. In this work, the curving of 2D graphitic C3N4 (g-C3N4) sheets into 1D nanotubes is demonstrated for the first time through simple and clean ultrasonic treatments. The steady-state optical transitions are slightly enhanced while the localized trapping of excited carriers is considerably suppressed after rolling up the planar sheets into nanotubes. The mechanical method to modulate the dimension scarcely changes the chemical structures, enabling the pure investigation on shape-induced physical effects. As a proof of principle, this work confirms the dynamics of excited carriers, and the photoelectronic properties of 2D semiconductors can be significantly engineered by a simple morphological evolution.
1. Introduction
Dimensionality plays a critical role in determining the properties of materials due to, for example, the different behaviors of electronic transitions confined in low-dimensional structures.1 Nowadays, various 2D atomic layered materials have triggered immense enthusiasm due to their high chemical stability, exceptional mechanical strength, unique electronic and optical properties, excellent biocompatibility, and easy functionalization.2 Further development of lower dimensionalities (1D nanotubes and 0D quantum dots (QDs)) from 2D materials is still in its infancy but is in great demand to meet new application requirements. The reduction of the dimensionality from 2D to 1D or 0D has produced remarkably rich and often unexpected results from the standpoints of both fundamental science and technology development. For instance, MoS2 QDs with sizes below 10 nm exhibit fluorescence with a remarkable blueshift and boosted quantum yield (QY) compared to 2D layers due to the additional quantum confinement effects across 2D planes.3 1D systems are the smallest dimensional structures that can be used for efficient transport of carriers, and are thus anticipated to be of high significance for devices integrated at a nanoscale. The curving of 2D atomic layers, including boron nitride (BN),4–6 transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)7,8 and black phosphorus,9 into 1D nanotubes thus has been intensively studied both theoretically and experimentally for pursuing novel physics and properties. For instance, the confinement of electrons in the transverse directions due to the small diameters is expected to lead to energy level quantization for electrons hopping on the tubular axis. Besides these early examples of layered materials (graphene, BN, MoS2, and WS2) that can be curved from 2D sheets into 1D nanotubes,4–9 flexible graphitic C3N4 (g-C3N4) provides a fertile ground for further experimental and theoretical investigations on the curved nanosheets with various intriguing properties associated with their small dimensions, high anisotropy, quantum effects and mechanical strain.
g-C3N4 is a metal-free 2D semiconductor, exhibiting high thermal stability in air up to 600 °C and good chemical stability resisting both acidic and basic conditions.10,11 Along with many other properties such as Earth abundant compositions, high flexibility, and inexpensive production at a large scale, this 2D material has become a promising candidate for applications in light harvesting, catalysis and fluorescence.12–14 By cutting 2D g-C3N4 sheets into ultrathin 0D QDs, enhanced intrinsic photo-absorption and photo-response, improved photoluminescence (PL) QY, and strong two-photon fluorescence were observed.15–17
To date, different chemical reactions have been developed to fabricate 1D g-C3N4 nanotubes.18–21 Guo et al. synthesised carbon nitride nanotubes via a benzene-thermal process under mild conditions.22 Liu et al. reported the fabrication of horn-like hollow mesoporous ultrathin g-C3N4 tubes via a one-pot co-pyrolysis route utilizing melamine and substantial ammonium bromide (NH4Br) as precursors.23 However, modifying the shape of g-C3N4 through chemical reactions is always accompanied by changes in chemical properties between the sheets and the tubes, making the pure investigation on shape induced properties inaccessible. Therefore, there is still a lack of a fundamental understanding of the optical transitions and carrier dynamics solely related to the curvature of the planar g-C3N4 sheets to nanotubes.
In this work, a facile and “clean” mechanical approach is developed to roll up planar sheets to form g-C3N4 nanotubes. It is found that the chemical compositions, functional groups, surface states, and atomic vacancies are retained after the morphological evolution. The variation of the shape only induces an in-plane tensile strain. Absorption, steady-state PL, PLQY, and calculation results reveal that optical transitions of g-C3N4 nanotubes in the visible range are slightly enhanced compared to those of the microsheets. Meanwhile, time resolved-PL (TRPL) decay reveals that the dynamics of photogenerated carriers in g-C3N4 microsheets and nanotubes are very distinct, which may give rise to a superior photoelectronic performance of the nanotubes. Therefore, this work confirms the validity of regulating the carrier dynamics of g-C3N4 by morphological transformation.
2. Experimental
2.1 Fabrication of g-C3N4 microsheets
The g-C3N4 microsheets were synthesized by thermal polycondensation of melamine. In detail, analytical grade melamine powder (5 g) was pressed into a ceramic crucible and then placed in the middle region of a muffle furnace. The melamine was heated to 550 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1, and then kept for 2 h. After the reaction, the obtained product was ground into a fine powder in an agate mortar.
2.2 Fabrication of g-C3N4 nanotubes
The g-C3N4 nanotubes were fabricated by simple liquid ultrasonication. The powder microsheets (200 mg) were dispersed in a mixture containing 50 ml ethanol and 50 ml deionized water. The dispersion was treated with a probe-sonic tip (diameter: 6 mm, frequency: 25 kHz) at 800 W for 3 h and subjected to bath-sonication (40 kHz and 100 W) for 1 h. Two kinds of ultrasonication processes were alternately conducted, each turn involving one hour of probe-sonication and twenty minutes of bath-sonication. The sonic tip was pulsed for 3 s-on and 3 s-off. The g-C3N4 nanotubes were collected by two-step centrifugation. First centrifugation was performed at 1000 rpm for 3 min, through which bulky components (can be reused for ultrasonication) were removed. The second stage centrifugation was performed at 8500 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant containing small nanoflakes was dropped and the solid sediments after centrifugation were collected. All the nanotubes were fabricated under the conditions mentioned above unless noted otherwise. The collected g-C3N4 nanotubes weighed about 70 mg in total. Thus, the yield is about 35%.
2.3 Characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out on a JEOL JEM-2100 electron microscope. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a NEXUS 670 FTIR spectrometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a PHI 5000 VersaProbe. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded with a Bruker EMX 10/12 X-band spectrometer. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a powder diffractometer (Rigaku Ultima III, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation. Raman spectra were collected at room temperature using a LabRAM HR800 (Jobin Yvon) micro-Raman spectrometer at an excitation wavelength of 785 nm. The absorption spectra were converted from diffuse reflectance spectra acquired on a Shimadzu UV-2600 UV-Vis-Near-infrared spectrophotometer. PL and time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurements were conducted on an Edinburgh FLS-920 PL spectrometer. A 375 nm picosecond pulse diode laser (2 MHz, 0.5 mW) was used as the excitation light. A 400 nm long pass filter was used to exclude the scattering of the laser. All the optical measurements were performed on solid powders.
2.4 Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations
The norm-conserving pseudopotential is used for the electron–ion interactions and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional from the generalized gradient approximation is employed to describe the exchange–correlation function. A cutoff energy of 700 eV and regular Monkhorst–Pack grid 4 × 4 × 1 k points are adopted to ensure energy convergence to within 1–2 meV per atom, which has been tested to be well converged. The vacuum space is at least 18 Å, which is large enough to avoid the interaction between periodical images. DFT calculations are performed to compute the optical transition matrix element associated with strains, which is defined as:38,39  where E is the transition energy,  is the Bloch wave vector of the superlattice,  is the position vector, and  is the unit vector along the polarization of the light.  is the wave function of the state in conduction (valence), and  is the corresponding eigen-energy.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Formation of nanotubes by ultrasonic cavitation

Fig. 1a displays a typical transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) image of the obtained g-C3N4 microsheets. They exhibit random lateral shapes with sizes mainly ranging from hundreds of nanometers to a few micrometers. After the designed ultrasonic treatments, a large amount of nanotubes can be found in the products (Fig. 1b). The yield of the nanotubes is estimated at approximately 35%, comparable to the highest yield reported by Guo et al. (∼40%).22 The zoomed-in TEM image in Fig. 1c confirms that the product is a nanotube evidenced by its open end (more evidence is shown in ESI S1†). The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern shown in the inset of Fig. 1c suggests that the nanotubes are crystalline. However, the crystallinity is of poor quality potentially due to structural defects. The lengths of the nanotubes are about 0.2–2.7 μm (Fig. 1d) and the diameters span from 20 to 250 nm (Fig. 1e). The length to width aspect ratio is plotted in a histogram (Fig. 1f), showing a dominant value at about 10. Thus, through simple mechanical treatments, g-C3N4 nanotubes are successfully fabricated in a high yield. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of converting 2D layered materials into 1D nanotubes through facile ultrasonication.

Inset: The corresponding SAED pattern. (d–f) Length (d), width (e) and aspect ratio (f) distributions of the nanotubes. 
The formation of the nanotubes can be well explained by the ultrasonic cavitation effect (Fig. 2).24 In most cases, the bubble attains a spherical shape and floats around in the liquid driven by various forces that it is susceptible to, notably pressure forces of all kinds from static to dynamic (for instance acoustic), from buoyancy to drag. The bubble in an acoustic field is a self-organized system, as it adjusts its size and shape to the trapping acoustic frequency and pressure amplitude. In fact, aspherical bubbles were widely observed and studied.26–28 The cavity clusters growing and collapsing adjacent to a solid surface are typically of hemispherical or cylindrical form.26 The collapse of elongated bubbles, subject to large internal overpressure, is studied by a boundary integral method.27 Besides, elongated, even square, toroidal, and v-shaped bubbles can be produced by a laser-induced cavitation effect.28 Herein, the formation of tubular bubbles by the ultrasonic cavitation effect was observed directly. A mixture of ethanol and water without g-C3N4 was subjected to probe-ultrasonication. As shown in Fig. 2a, when the power is 800 W, a light fog rapidly appears in the solvent, indicating the formation of bubbles. By further zooming in the rectangular area in Fig. 2a, plenty of elongated bubbles with different sizes are observed (Fig. 2b). They distribute in a vortex, implying that hydromechanics may contribute to the formation of elongated bubbles (Fig. 2c). In addition, the unidirectional propagation of the ultrasonic wave would be a crucial factor. The sizes of the bubbles shown in the photographs are approximately one millimetre. However, as indicated by the fog, there are also many much smaller nano-/micro-bubbles with similar shapes induced by the ultrasonic cavitation, which are responsible for the formation of g-C3N4 nanotubes.

It is generally accepted that there are two types of acoustic cavitation in liquids (Fig. 3a). One is the stable cavitation typically generated at low acoustic fields and the other type is inertial (or transient) cavitation mainly occurring when the ultrasonic power is high, wherein bubbles oscillate and ultimately chaotically collapse within a few sound wave cycles. Both kinds of bubbles in a fluid are forced to oscillate in size or shape due to the energy input by the acoustic field. The bubble oscillation strongly depends on the density (ρ), the dynamic viscosity (μ), and the surface tension (σ) of the liquid, as well as the external pressure produced by ultrasonic waves.25 Thereby, the bubbles can be controlled by the power of the probe-sonication.
 Fig. 3  (a) Schematic illustration of the bubbles formed by the ultrasonic cavitation effect at different powers. The sizes of stable nano-bubbles increase first and then decrease when the ultrasonic power increases from 200 to 950 W. (b–d) Morphological evolution of g-C3N4 subjected to probe-ultrasonication at different powers: 200 W (b), 800 W (c), and 950 W (d). All scale bar: 200 nm. When the ultrasonic power is 800 W, the sizes of the bubbles match with the g-C3N4 sheets, resulting in high yields of g-C3N4 nanotubes. 
To investigate the formation mechanism of the nanotubes, the power of the probe-sonication was tuned while other treatment conditions were retained. Meanwhile, a direct observation of the bubble behaviour was performed correspondingly, and the results and discussion are presented in ESI S2 and S3.† When the ultrasonic power is 200 W, mainly tiny and stable bubbles form. As displayed in Fig. 3b and ESI S4,† the bubbles permeate into the loose g-C3N4 microsheets. Many voids appear in the g-C3N4 sheets, in analogy with the erosion of solids caused by cavitating liquids.26 When the ultrasonic power is 600–800 W, the growth and collapse of cavitation bubbles are evidently enhanced. As a result of the unidirection of the ultrasonic wave and complex hydromechanics, plenty of elongated bubbles with different sizes distributing in a vortex were observed (Fig. 2 and ESI S3†). The elongated bubbles act as scaffolds rolling up the 2D g-C3N4 into nanotubes due to the surface tension, hydrophobic force, and internal–external pressure difference. Furthermore, the collapse of the cavitation bubbles is a near adiabatic process and results in the generation of high temperatures within these bubbles,29 which may heat the g-C3N4 microsheets locally and provide the energy for deformation. In turn, the g-C3N4 sheets may rectify the growth and collapse of the cavitation bubbles. Compared to the collapse of a free bubble, it was seen that the collapse of a bubble in the vicinity of a solid boundary possibly shows more pronounced asymmetry in its initial geometry, in which case the generated bubbles are much smaller in size, on the order of a few micrometers.26 Therefore, as illustrated in Fig. 3c, the g-C3N4 nanotubes form by employing the elongated bubbles as templates. Moreover, as displayed in Fig. 3c, the observation of semi-rolled nanotubes verifies the curving process. If the ultrasonic power is as high as 950 W (Fig. 3d), the bubbles collapse and oscillate much faster and the fraction of transient bubbles further increases. Thus, the bubbles rapidly undergo blasting, bursting or runaway shrinking before reaching a size as large as a few micrometers. In this case, the sizes of the stable bubbles, similar to the g-C3N4 nanotubes, are much smaller. Meanwhile, the rapid collapse of bubbles with a jet, producing a shock wave, may act as a hammer knocking on the C3N4 microsheets. Consequently, a large amount of nanoflakes appear as evidenced in Fig. 3d and ESI S5.† In principle, the feasibility of this physical method essentially relies on the mechanical properties of the 2D materials. When similar treatments are conducted on MoS2 and black phosphorus, usually the 2D materials are fractured to ultrasmall quantum dots due to the shear force-induced exfoliation and scission force-induced cutting. See more discussion in ESI S6.†
3.2 Engineering the carrier dynamics using strain
The acquired g-C3N4 nanotubes were comprehensively investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) (ESI S7†), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (ESI S8†), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) (ESI S9†), X-ray diffraction (XRD) (ESI S10†), and Raman spectroscopy (ESI S11†). Both FTIR and XPS results reveal that the chemical compositions, functional groups, and atomic structures of g-C3N4 microsheets and nanotubes are nearly the same, indicating that the mechanical treatment is “clean” without inducing any unintended impurities and defects. The intensities of the EPR signals of the microsheets and nanotubes are very close indicating the density of atomic vacancies being retained during the change of shapes. However, the divergence of g values implies that the unpaired electron must have gained or lost the angular momentum through spin–orbit coupling due to the possible strain. In the XRD pattern of g-C3N4 microsheets (ESI S10, ESI†), there is an intense peak located at 27.5° and a low-angle peak at 12.5°. The former represents the inter-planar graphitic stacking, which is associated with the interlayer distance, and the latter is indicative of the in-plane structural packing. This peak position confirms that the motif of acquired g-C3N4 is tri-s-triazine.14,20,30,31 After rolling up into nanotubes, the strong peak remains at 27.5° while the low-angle peak downshifts to 11.6°, reflecting the extending of the distance between the tri-s-triazine rings. In the Raman spectra (ESI S11†), there are three modes (541, 740, and 978 cm−1) appearing at the same positions, whereas, the peak at 1165 cm−1 shifts toward lower frequencies after the microsheets are rolled up into nanotubes. This peak is ascribed to the C (sp2) bending vibrations, sensitively depending on the C–N covalent bonds.32 The redshift of this mode suggests that the C–N bonds are stretched, which also means that the distances between the tri-s-triazine rings are extended. Overall, the structural characterization fully confirms the formation of graphitic phase C3N4. During the morphological evolution, the chemical structures are retained, while an in-plane tensile strain is introduced (Fig. 4a), similar to the curvature of graphene, MoS2, and polymers stabilized with strain energy.33–36

(b) Normalized PL spectra of g-C3N4 microsheets (black line) and nanotubes (red line). (c). Calculated average squared optical matrix element |P|2 as a function of energy for monolayer g-C3N4 with different strains. 0% means no strain is applied, while 3% and −3% represent tension and compression plane strains, respectively. 
The strain, accompanying the wrapping of 2D sheets to nanotubes, is expected to directly modify the optoelectronic properties.37 Herein, absorption, PL, and TRPL are used to investigate the g-C3N4 nanotubes. As shown in Fig. 4b, by normalizing the two PL spectra, it is found that the PL intensity of nanotubes in the range of 475 to 600 nm (highlight) is slightly enhanced compared to that of the microsheets. The absolute PLQYs of microsheets and nanotubes are 8.14% and 8.47%, respectively. The minor increment in the PLQY is consistent with the PL spectra. The same features are also reflected in the absorption spectra (ESI S12†). To theoretically elucidate the dependence of the optical transition on the structural deformation, a density-functional theory (DFT) study was conducted on a g-C3N4 monolayer with different external strains using the CASTEP package.38,39 The calculation results are plotted in Fig. 4c. When a 3% symmetrical tension strain is applied, the average squared optical matrix elements in the wavelength range of 475–600 nm are slightly enhanced, which perfectly match with the observed absorption and steady PL spectra. However, if a compressed deformation (−3%) is applied, this optical transition fades down slightly at the corresponding wavelength range. The optical properties are determined from the electronic structure, which is essentially decided by the crystal structure, such as the space group, crystal cell parameter, and atomic arrangement. The tension strain makes the crystal lattice expand, thus affecting the optical transition and carrier dynamics.
Surprisingly, the TRPL results reveal that the relaxations of excited states in g-C3N4 microsheets and nanotubes are fundamentally different, despite the discrepancy in the steady-state PL being insignificant. As shown in Fig. 5a, contour mapping spectra reveal that the relaxation of the microsheets slows down when the emission wavelength increases. The PL decay curves are fitted with the thermalized stretching exponential model,40,41 (1)in which τi is the decay lifetime and Ii is the weight factor of each decay channel. The first exponential term represents the relaxation of free or extended states towards localized states, while the latter stretched-exponential term is related to the relaxation of localized states, and β is related to the dimensionality of the localized traps. Fig. 5b shows a typical fitting of the decay monitored at the emission wavelength of 450 nm. All the decay curves can be well fitted with β factors of 0.46–0.57. The τ1 and τ2 values fitted from the decay curves monitored at various emission energies are plotted in Fig. 5c. The lifetime parameters almost remain constant (∼20 ns) in the low-energy side (2.5–2.8 eV) due to the localization effect (highlighted by the shadow areas). Meanwhile, when the emission energy is above the bandgap, the lifetime decreases with the photon energy, which is ascribed to the fast relaxation of the higher excited states to the band edge. The shortest τ2 is about 10 ns. The relationship between τ2 values and emission photon energy can be described by:40 (2)where τLT is the lifetime of localized traps, Eme is the mobility edge, which points out the boundary between localized and extended states, and E0 is the localization energy of the trap states. The fitting results manifest that τLT = 20.0632 ns, Eme = 3.00433 eV, and E0 = 74.05 meV. The lifetime of low-energy photons (2.5–2.8 eV) is evidently longer than that of band-edge emission, indicating that the transitions of bandtails and midgap states are dominated by slow traps. However, Fig. 5d demonstrates that the relaxation of the excited states in g-C3N4 nanotubes shows less dependence on the monitored wavelength. The decay curves are also fitted with eqn (1) and a typical fitting result is plotted in Fig. 5e. The β factors are 0.73–0.81, indicating the dimensionality of the localized trap changes. The fitted τ1 and τ2 values versus emission photon energies are plotted in Fig. 5f. All the τ2 values are about 10 ns, implying that the long-lived trapping by localized states is tremendously suppressed in the nanotubes. To conclude, although the enhancement in optical absorption is minor, the trapping by the localized states is apparently eliminated. Compared to the microsheets, the photogenerated carriers of the nanotubes can be harvested more fluently. This aspect would be greatly beneficial for many photoresponsive devices and applications, such as photo-electrochemical cells, photodetectors, and solar cells, since the trapping of carriers by the localized states primarily harms the photon to current conversion efficiency. A simple photo-degradation example is presented in ESI S14 and 15.† The photocatalytic activity of the g-C3N4 nanotubes is noticeably improved compared to that of the microsheets. A comparison of the C3N4 nanotubes in this work to the references is shown in ESI S16.†

4. Conclusions
In summary, a simple and clean ultrasonic method is developed to curve the 2D g-C3N4 sheets into 1D nanotubes. An in-plane tension strain is introduced by the morphological evolution, as confirmed by the XRD and Raman results. A slight enhancement in the steady-state optical transition is observed in the g-C3N4 nanotubes due to the strain effect, but the dynamics of the carriers is fundamentally modified. It is found that the relaxations of the excited states in the g-C3N4 microsheets are strongly dominated by localized traps, whereas, a faster decay with less influence from the traps is observed in the transient PL of the g-C3N4 nanotubes. Our results reveal that the shape induced-strain plays a pivotal role in the fundamental difference in the transient dynamics of the g-C3N4 microsheets and nanotubes, implying that various mechanical stimulations without chemical modification will also significantly regulate the photogenerated carrier behaviour of g-C3N4, which may be utilized in optical sensors for mechanics. Moreover, this work enriches the strategies to modulate electronic, optical, and photoelectronic properties of 2D semiconductors thus promoting their practical applications.

Table Content:

 		 

 	Fig. 1  (a) TEM image of g-C3N4 microsheets. (b) TEM image of g-C3N4 nanotubes fabricated by 800 W probe-ultrasonication. (c) TEM image focusing on a single nanotube showing the open end. Inset: The corresponding SAED pattern. (d–f) Length (d), width (e) and aspect ratio (f) distributions of the nanotubes.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Photograph of the bubbles generated by probe-ultrasonication at a power of 800 W. (b) An enlarged image of the selected area in (a) showing crowded bubbles. (c) Schematic illustration of the formation of tubular bubbles via ultrasonic cavitation.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Schematic illustration of the bubbles formed by the ultrasonic cavitation effect at different powers. The sizes of stable nano-bubbles increase first and then decrease when the ultrasonic power increases from 200 to 950 W. (b–d) Morphological evolution of g-C3N4 subjected to probe-ultrasonication at different powers: 200 W (b), 800 W (c), and 950 W (d). All scale bar: 200 nm. When the ultrasonic power is 800 W, the sizes of the bubbles match with the g-C3N4 sheets, resulting in high yields of g-C3N4 nanotubes.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Schematic diagram illustrating the tensile strain induced by the roll-up process of a sheet into a tube. (b) Normalized PL spectra of g-C3N4 microsheets (black line) and nanotubes (red line). (c). Calculated average squared optical matrix element |P|2 as a function of energy for monolayer g-C3N4 with different strains. 0% means no strain is applied, while 3% and −3% represent tension and compression plane strains, respectively.

 	Fig. 5  (a, d) Contour mapping of TRPL spectra monitored at 410 to 490 nm. Intensity: Logarithmic coordinate. The corresponding decay curves are shown in ESI S13.† (b, e) Typical fitting of a decay curve with the thermalized stretching exponential model. Both x (time) and y (intensity) axes are logarithmic coordinates. The start of decay (maximum intensity) is set at t = 0. (c, f) The fitted lifetime parameters as a function of emission energy. The lifetime τ2 (red balls) of the microsheets as a function of the emission energy is fitted with eqn (2). All the errors for τ1 are about 0.01 to 0.02 ns; thus the error bars are masked with the blue symbols.
