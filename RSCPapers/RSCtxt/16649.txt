    , Accepted 18th December 2019First published on 19th December 2019AbstractPerylene diimide (PDI) oligomers, in which the PDI panels were fused together by ethylene bridges, have emerged as potential alternatives to the parent PDI in organic optoelectronic materials. Meanwhile, triphenylamine (TPA), owing to its facile synthesis, flexible modification, excellent electron donating capability and twisted molecular structure, is commonly employed as the congested core to construct star-shaped electron acceptors and donors for organic solar cells (OSCs). In this contribution, a TPA-cored helical perylene diimide oligomer (PDI2) electron acceptor, namely TPA-3PDI2, was designed and synthesized. Using the commercially available PTB7-Th as an electron donor, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.57% was obtained for the room temperature (RT) spin-coating blend based OSCs. Interestingly, the hot spin-coating blend based OSCs showed a higher PCE of 7.04%. The results demonstrate that using PDI2 as a building block to construct star-shaped acceptors is a facile strategy to achieve considerable PCEs in OSCs and also, hot spin-coating is a feasible method for morphology optimization.
Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have garnered significant attention in the past two decades due to the advantages of light weight, low cost fabrication, easy solution-processability and flexibility.1–5 Owing to the inherent drawbacks of fullerene based acceptors such as weak absorption in the visible region, high cost, and limited energy-level tunability, the research hotspot has been transferred to the non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) in recent years.6–16 Through continuous efforts in material design and device engineering, impressive high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have been achieved for both NFA based single and tandem solar cells.17–25 Perylene diimide (PDI), owing to its outstanding optoelectronic properties, has become one of the most commonly studied building blocks of NFAs.26–29 According to the semi-empirical evidence, a trade-off between avoiding the formation of large crystalline domains and maintaining efficient charge transport ability is a key issue to obtain high performance PDI based OSCs. Thus, the crystallinity of the semiconductors should neither be too strong nor too weak. As a consequence, a substantial number of PDI derivatives with twisted structures have been developed in the past decade.30–32 One of the most employed strategies to construct the twisted PDI derivatives is to couple several PDI units to congested cores.
Besides the advantages of facile synthesis and flexible modification, the triphenylamine (TPA) core possesses a hole-transport property that may be beneficial to achieve a balanced hole/electron transport behavior as well as reduce the charge recombination.33–35 However, only a moderate PCE (∼5%) was obtained for the TPA-cored PDI derivatives.36–40 Thanks to the concisely synthetic strategies developed by the Nuckolls and Wang groups independently,41–45 the helical π-extended PDI oligomers based on ring-fused ethylene bridges, especially for the PDI dimer (PDI2), have been emerging as a potential alternative to the parent PDI in constructing NFAs.46–60 Furthermore, our recent works show that replacing the peripheral PDI panels in the 9,10-anthraquinone (AQ)-cored or 9,9′-spirobifluorene (SF)-cored NFAs with PDI2 units shows remarkable improvements in the photovoltaic performance.61,62
In light of the advantages of TPA and PDI2 moieties mentioned above, a TPA-cored PDI2 trimer, namely TPA-3PDI2, was designed and synthesized (Fig. 1). TPA-3PDI2 was fully characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and mass spectrometry (ESI†). Owing to its twisted structure and the introduction of the alkyl chain at the N-position of PDI2, this compound shows good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform and chlorobenzene. The thermal stability and optoelectronic properties of TPA-3PDI2 were well studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), UV-Vis absorption, photoluminescence spectrometry and cyclic voltammetry (CV). It shows complementary absorption and well-aligned energy levels with the commercially available polymer donor PTB7-Th. However, the as-cast TPA-3PDI2:PTB7-Th blend based device exhibited only a moderate PCE of 5.57%, which was commensurate with those of the PDI counterparts.36–40 To improve the device performance, different solvents and additives, as well as post-treatment methods including solvent vapor annealing (SVA), thermal annealing (TA) and hot spin-coating were tested.63 Fortunately, we found that with the assistance of hot spin-coating processing, devices based on TPA-3PDI2:PTB7-Th blends gave a maximum PCE of 7.04%, with a Voc of 0.801 V, a Jsc of 14.82 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 59.30%. The previous reports showed that hot spin-coating could tune the crystalline behaviors of the donor or acceptor, leading to changes in the absorption spectra and morphology of the blends, and then exert effects on the photovoltaic performance of the devices.64–70 However, in the case of TPA-3PDI2:PTB7-Th blends, no obvious change in the absorption spectra was observed upon hot spin-coating. The enhancements in the photovoltaic performance of the TPA-3PDI2:PTB7-Th based device can be rationalized by the fact that hot spin-coating processing could reduce the trap-assisted recombination.

Results and discussion
Material synthesis and characterization
The NFA TPA-3PDI2 (Fig. 1) was synthesized through Pd-catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction between monobromo-PDI2 and tris(4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)phenyl)amine in a good yield of 57% (Scheme S1, ESI†). The monobromo-PDI2 was synthesized according to the literature.41,42 The target molecule shows good solubility in common solvents and its structure was fully characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (ESI†). As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the good thermal stability of TPA-3PDI2 was confirmed by TGA with a decomposition temperature (5% weight loss) of 395 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere.
The optical properties of TPA-3PDI2 were studied by UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence spectra while its electrochemical properties were determined through cyclic voltammetry (CV). As shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. S2 (ESI†), in the chloroform solution, TPA-3PDI2 exhibited a broad absorption range from 300 to 700 nm with maxima at 392 and 541 nm. The molar extinction coefficient of TPA-3PDI2 was established to be 1.9 × 105 M−1 cm−1 for the long-wavelength absorption maximum. The absorption spectrum in the film state was similar to that in chloroform solution. The absorption spectrum of TPA-3PDI2 in hexane solution is broader than that in chloroform solution, which can be ascribed to its relatively lower solubility in hexane resulting in the formation of nanoparticles of size around 712 nm (Fig. S2, ESI†). However, no nanoparticles were detected in chloroform solution and this has been confirmed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements (Fig. S2, ESI†). The emission spectrum in the film state exhibits an obvious red- or blue-shift as compared to that of hexane or chloroform solution, respectively (Fig. S2, ESI†), indicating a solvatochromic fluorescence property of TPA-3PDI2. The optical band gap was established to be 1.77 eV based on the onset of absorption (Table S1, ESI†). The CV pattern of TPA-3PDI2 (Fig. S3, ESI†) was characterized in dichloromethane solution at room temperature. It shows two quasi-reversible reduction waves and the LUMO level was estimated to be −3.81 eV based on the reduction onset. The HOMO level was calculated to be −3.81 eV according to the LUMO level and the optical band gap. As shown in Fig. 1c, the energy levels of TPA-3PDI2 are well-aligned with those of PTB7-Th, together with their complementary absorptions, illustrating that PTB7-Th is a suitable electron donor for constructing OSC devices.
Photovoltaic performance
Subsequently, inverted devices of glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag were fabricated using PTB7-Th:TPA-3PDI2 blends as the photoactive layer. The pre-optimization of the fabricating conditions of different donor/acceptor weight ratios as well as various thermal annealing (TA) temperatures was conducted. The current density–voltage (J−V) characteristics of the best OSC devices under illumination are shown in Fig. 2a and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table 1 and Tables S2, S3 (ESI†). The results showed that 1:1 is the optimal donor/acceptor weight ratio while thermal annealing has a slight adverse effect on the PCE. The best PCE of 5.57%, with a Voc of 0.802 V, a Jsc of 12.09 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 57.50%, was obtained for the RT spin-coated devices, which was commensurate with those of the PDI counterparts. However, considerable improvements in the PCE as well as other photovoltaic performance parameters were achieved by using hot spin-coating manipulation. The temperature of hot spin-coating was optimized and the highest PCE of 7.04%, with a Voc of 0.801 V, a Jsc of 14.82 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 59.30%, was obtained at 60 °C (Table S4, ESI†). The previously reported cases of hot spin-coating, which could elevate the photovoltaic performances by tuning the aggregation behaviors of the donors and/or acceptors, resulted in palpable changes in the absorption spectra and morphologies.64–70 However, there were negligible changes in the absorption spectra of TPA-3PDI2:PTB7-Th blends upon hot spin-coating processing (Fig. S4, ESI†). To further analyze and confirm the accuracy of J–V measurements, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of optimal devices based on RT or hot spin-coating TPA-3PDI2:PTB7-Th blends were measured (Fig. 2b). Both the devices showed broad photoresponses varying from 300 to 800 nm, which corresponds to the absorption spectra of the donor and acceptor. It is noteworthy that the EQE value of the hot spin-coating processed devices is higher than that of the RT spin-coating processed ones ranging from 400 nm to 750 nm. Moreover, the calculated Jsc values integrated from the EQE spectra were 11.80 mA cm−2 and 14.54 mA cm−2 for RT and hot spin-coated devices, respectively (Fig. 2b), which are well matched with the corresponding data obtained by J–V measurements.

To gain a deep insight into the enhancements in the photovoltaic performances resulting from hot spin-coating, the charge recombination kinetics in these devices were studied by measuring Voc and Jsc as functions of light intensity (Plight), respectively (Fig. 3a and b). The dependence of Voc on light intensity, as shown in Fig. 3a, was fit to the equation of Voc ∝ nkT/qln(Plight). In principle, the slope at or approaching kT/q suggests that bimolecular recombination dominates the system, while it being equal to 2kT/q implies a reduction in bimolecular recombination and the trap-assisted recombination dominates in the devices.56,71 The slopes of the RT and hot spin-coated devices were 1.56kT/q and 1.30kT/q, respectively, which demonstrated that hot spin-coating processing could reduce the trap-assisted recombination, resulting in a better photovoltaic performance. As shown in Fig. 3b, the light intensity dependence of Jsc was fit to a power law relation Jsc ∝ Plightα, where the α value is the exponential factor. Weak bimolecular recombination and efficient carrier collection are implied when α is close to 1. The α values for the RT and hot spin-coated devices were 0.94 and 0.96, respectively, which indicated a weaker bimolecular recombination for the devices treated with the latter operation.

(d) The steady photoluminescence spectra for PTB7-Th films and blend films upon RT and hot spin-coating (excited at 640 nm). 
To further understand charge collection and exciton dissociation, which are determined by normalizing Jph with Jsat (Jph/Jsat), the relationship between photocurrent (Jph) and effective voltage (Veff) was investigated. Jsat refers to the saturation photocurrent density and Veff is dependent on the internal electric field in OSCs. As shown in Fig. 3c, the Jph/Jsat values are 0.90 and 0.95 for the RT and hot spin-coated devices, respectively. The higher Jph/Jsat ratio of hot spin-coated devices suggested a better exciton dissociation rate and charge collection probability. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the hot spin-coating processed devices possessed lower leakage (shunt) currents and series resistance than in the case of the RT spin-coating processed ones, thus contributing to the higher FF and Jsc. To explore the charge transfer at the donor–acceptor interface, the photoluminescence (PL) quenching measurements were conducted (Fig. 3d, Fig. S6 and Table S5, ESI†). The PL quenching efficiencies of RT spin-coating blends were 94.8% and 99.2% as compared with the neat PTB7-Th and TPA-3PDI2 films, respectively. However, the hot spin-coating blends displayed higher PL quenching efficiencies of 95.3% and 99.4% in comparison to the donor and acceptor neat film, respectively.
To further investigate the carrier transport properties, the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method was employed to investigate the hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities of PTB7-Th:TPA-3PDI2 blend based OSCs. The devices with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag and ITO/ZnO/active layer/LiF/Al were fabricated to measure the hole and electron mobilities, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, the device based on RT spin-coating blends exhibited a hole mobility of 1.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility of 2.3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. In the case of hot spin-coating blends, a slightly decreased hole mobility of 1.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a markedly elevated electron mobility of 7.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 were obtained. The more balanced charge transport of the hot spin-coating blends, together with the less trap-assisted recombination, should contribute to the higher Jsc and FF values for the devices.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement of the RT and hot spin-coating blends has been carried out to investigate the crystalline structures. As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), similar broad and weak diffraction peaks in the range of 15∼25 degree were observed for both RT and hot spin-coating blends suggesting low crystallinity. This low crystallinity might be favorable to the trade-off between phase separation and self-aggregation. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed to gain insight into the morphology of the active films. It is well-known that a favorable RMS value and phase morphology of the blends are of great importance for high photovoltaic performance. As shown in Fig. 5, both the RT and hot spin-coating PTB7-Th:TPA-3PDI2 blends showed smooth surfaces with root-mean-square (RMS) values of 0.88 and 1.04 nm, respectively. The RMS values are within the reasonable range but cannot be the reason for the higher Jsc and FF of the hot spin-coating blend based devices. However, the phase images indicated that the hot spin-coating blends possessed more favorable phase separation. Moreover, the 3D images showed that hot spin-coating blends contained more continuous nanoscale phase sizes comparable to the exciton diffusion length, which can contribute to the better photovoltaic performance. The TEM images (Fig. S8, ESI†) also showed nanoscale phase separation morphology for hot spin-coating blends, which is in accordance with the AFM observations. These results illustrated that hot spin-coating can not only reduce the trap-assisted recombination, but also improve the phase separation in the blends, leading to better photovoltaic performance than in the case of RT spin-coating.

Conclusion
In summary, a TPA cored PDI oligomer, namely TPA-3PDI2, was designed and synthesized. The optoelectronic properties of TPA-3PDI2 were studied and it has been applied to OSCs as a NFA blend with PTB7-Th. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.57% was obtained for the room temperature (RT) spin-coating blend based OSCs. With the assistance of hot spin-coating processing, the PCE can be improved to 7.04%, with a Voc of 0.801 V, a Jsc of 14.82 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 59.30%. The improvements were rationalized by the fact that hot spin-coating processing could reduce the trap-assisted recombination and endow a better phase morphology of the blends. These results indicated that PDI2 is a promising building block for NFAs and hot spin-coating is a feasible method for promoting the photovoltaic performance of the OSCs.
