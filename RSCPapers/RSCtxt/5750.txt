    , Accepted 23rd April 2020First published on 24th April 2020AbstractAll-inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are attracting considerable attention due to their excellent thermal stability. However, their unsatisfactory power-conversion efficiency and moisture instability lead to challenges for practical commercialization. Here, a facile but effective strategy is demonstrated to stabilize/passivate the cubic phase of CsPbI3 by inhibiting the moisture invasion using 18-crown-6 ether (Crown). The strong interaction between Crown and surface Cs+ ion not only effectively improved the moisture tolerance, but also simultaneously reduced surface defects and related migrations, thus accordingly improving the phase and operation stability of the CsPbI3 films and devices. Based on the obtained high-quality CsPbI3–Crown films, PSCs with up to 16.9% efficiency were fabricated. The devices readily maintained ∼91% of the initial PCE for more than 1000 h (85 °C, N2) and even ∼90% for up to 2000 h (relative humidity 20%) without encapsulation. More importantly, the developed strategy has been successfully used to fabricate large-area CsPbI3 modules, showing an efficiency of up to 11.8% with the 16 cm2 total area. A stability performance that can retain ∼95% of the original value for over 500 h (operating conditions, relative humidity 60%) with encapsulation has also been achieved in the first PSC module based on the CsPbI3 system.
Introduction
With the rapid development in successful fabrication of high-quality perovskite films,1,2 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have become promising candidates towards next-generation low-cost and efficient photovoltaics. Recently, a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 25.2% has been achieved in lab-scale hybrid PSCs,3 making the practical applications and even commercialization of PSCs more and more feasible. However, the instability of organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs still remains unsolved due to the volatility of their organic components that often induce degradation of devices under moisture, light or thermal conditions.4–9 Owing to the superior thermal stabilities over organohalide perovskites,10–12 all-inorganic perovskites have been attracting increasing research attention.13 Among them, cesium lead iodide (denoted as CsPbI3), possessing a high charge mobility and suitable bandgap for solar spectrum absorption in its cubic phase (α phase), is considered to be an excellent candidate for fabricating efficient all-inorganic PSCs.14
Unfortunately, due to the intrinsic structural instability of α-CsPbI3 with a relatively low tolerance factor,15 phase transformation to ‘yellow’ morphology (δ-phase) always undesirably occurs during the fabrication process and the subsequent device applications, which strongly limits the preparation of efficient and stable inorganic PSCs. Despite the fact that various strategies, such as growth control,16 composition engineering,17–19 and fabrication of quantum dots20–22 or 2D/3D hybrid structures,23,24 have been employed to grow high-quality α phase CsPbI3 films for high-performance devices, it should be pointed out that most of these methods were still limited to being performed in an inert atmosphere and with complicated procedures, making it still challenging to scale up the fabrication process. In addition, how to stabilize CsPbI3-based PSCs under ambient working conditions is another big challenge. For the as-prepared α-phase CsPbI3 films, the moisture assisted polymorphic transition (α-to-δ phase) has been well acknowledged to be the dominant route for material inactivation for photovoltaics.15,25 Moreover, defect migration, which was believed to be induced by ion migration on the surface and within grain boundaries of perovskite films,26–29 was considered to be another important factor for long-term instability, especially under operating conditions.30 Until now, several attempts, such as coating with hydrophobic polymers and bulk organic cations, have been made to restrain moisture from attacking perovskites to improve the stability and efficiency of corresponding devices.31–34 However, the defect migration related instability still has not been considered in inorganic perovskite systems for most of the studies, although varieties of methods have been used to alleviate ion migration to reduce defects and charge recombination in hybrid perovskite films.35–38 And the currently reported CsPbI3-based PSCs also still suffered from degradation and have not yet been stable enough under real air ambient conditions.39,40 Therefore, exploring a simple and effective method to produce and stabilize high-quality CsPbI3 perovskite films represents a fundamental urgency for high-performance inorganic PSC modules toward potential industrialization.
Here, we develop a novel strategy to use 1,4,7,10,13,16-hexaoxacyclooctadecane ether (i.e. 18-crown-6, denoted as Crown) for suppressing water invasion and passivating defects, and thus facilitate the stabilization of α-CsPbI3 thin films for PSCs. In the developed method, a unique compound, PbI2 pre-coordinated with N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone in solid form (denoted as PbI2·NMP), was used to assist the formation of regular, pinhole-free and high-quality α-CsPbI3 films. The effective inhibition of moisture invasion and phase transformation was well accomplished by the Crown terminated CsPbI3 films, in which the methylene (–CH2) outer structure of Crown prevented water attack, and the inner cavity strongly bonded with surface Cs+ ions to passivate surface defects. The simultaneously suppressed defect migration due to the strong anchoring of Crown to perovskites via bonding with Cs+ ions was also evidenced to be highly responsible for the significantly improved operation stability. Consequently, together with excellent long-term storage and working and thermal stabilities, the corresponding PSCs successfully achieved a maximum efficiency of 16.9%. Moreover, large-area (16 cm2) PSC modules based on Crown-engineered CsPbI3 films were readily constructed and had a champion efficiency over 11.8%. The encapsulated PSC module predictably demonstrated an attractive stability which can maintain 95.2% of its original value for over 500 h under operating conditions at RH ∼60%.
Results and discussion
PbI2·NMP-assisted growth of high-quality α-CsPbI3 films
In this work, a PbI2·NMP solid compound, produced by the reaction of PbI2 and NMP followed by solvent evaporation, was employed to fabricate CsPbI3 films via a one-step deposition strategy by mixing this compound with a CsI solution (Fig. S1 and S2†). As shown in Fig. 1a–d, high-quality perovskite films in the pure α phase were obtained under ambient conditions with a low relative humidity (RH) of 10–15%. The perovskite film derived from PbI2·NMP was denser and smoother than that from PbI2–NMP liquid (NMP was directly added into the precursor solution, named as PbI2–NMP, Fig. S3†). Then the corresponding CsPbI3 PSCs were fabricated using the typical normal configuration of FTO/ZnO–ZnS/m-TiO2-perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au.41 As shown in Fig. 1e and Table S1,† PbI2·NMP-based PSCs with champion efficiencies of RS 13.03% and FS 12.53% (RS: reverse scan, FS: forward scan) were obtained, which displayed higher PCE and smaller hysteresis than the PbI2–NMP-based one (Fig. S4†). Thus, it can be inferred that the PbI2·NMP compound is more suitable to prepare high-quality CsPbI3 films and devices. And the obtained photovoltaic performance is also already comparable with the latest reported data.19,31,32,39 However, while under AM 1.5 G illumination with a high RH of 45 ± 5% in air (Fig. 1f), it can be seen that the efficiency of the unencapsulated device dramatically dropped to 1.3% after aging for 90 min. With the testing time further extended, the α phase of CsPbI3 totally degraded to the δ phase (Fig. S5†). Therefore, this strongly indicates that the search for an effective passivation strategy to stabilize as-fabricated α-CsPbI3 films is very highly demanded besides the successful preparation of high-quality α-CsPbI3 films for PV applications.

Crown passivation enabled stable α-CsPbI3 films and devices
In this work, crown ether was preferably introduced to passivate CsPbI3 perovskites and thus effectively inhibit the moisture attack to avoid phase transformation not only during ambient air storage but also under operation conditions (Fig. 2a). Crown is a well-known chelating agent, containing an inner cavity that can bond strongly and selectively with Cs+ ions (Fig. S6 and S7†),42 while the Crown-terminated CsPbI3 exhibits a methylene (–CH2) outer structure (Fig. S8†) on the surface, helping to enhance the moisture tolerance of CsPbI3 and thus inhibit the phase transformation. The surface defects of CsPbI3 perovskites would also be expected to be effectively passivated by the surface modification like other introduced organic species.34 Thus, by introducing Crown engineering, overall improvement in the stability and photovoltaic performance of Crown-passivated CsPbI3 PSCs should be expected.

The characterization results of XRD patterns, UV-vis, and PL spectra (Fig. S9 and S10†) well evidenced obviously higher optical properties and crystal quality in the Crown treated CsPbI3 films (denoted as CsPbI3–Crown) as compared to the CsPbI3 films. The CsPbI3–Crown and CsPbI3 perovskite films both displayed similar morphologies, but their properties were strongly dependent on the Crown concentration. The optimized amount of Crown was demonstrated to be 1 mg mL−1 when used for the treatment (Fig. S11–S13 and Table S2†). Here, the α-phase structure of CsPbI3 was evidently identified by HRTEM (Fig. 2b) for the crystalline domain of the Crown terminated CsPbI3 film. A well-resolved inter-planar distance of 3.1 Å, corresponding to the (200) plane of CsPbI3 consistent with the XRD results (Fig. S14a†), was clearly detected. It should be noted that the CsPbI3–Crown perovskite films displayed similar morphologies and thicknesses of about 430 nm to those of CsPbI3 films (Fig. 2c and S15†), in which Crown was uniformly distributed on the CsPbI3 surface (Fig. S16†). Although there are no distinguishable morphology discrepancies, obviously stronger intensity in both XRD patterns and UV-vis spectra (Fig. S14†) was still observed in the Crown-passivated CsPbI3 films under consistent test conditions. Considering the moisture-sensitive nature of CsPbI3 films, the improved film quality should understandably originate from the well maintained intrinsic crystal structure after the surface passivation.
Benefitting from the film quality improvement, an overall PCE of 16.91% in the RS mode with a high FF of 77.61%, Jsc of 20.56 mA cm−2, and Voc of 1.06 V was achieved in the CsPbI3–Crown based PSCs, which significantly surpasses that of the champion CsPbI3-device having an overall PCE of RS 13.03%, Jsc of 18.81 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.91 V, and FF of 76.13% under AM 1.5 G illumination, as shown in Fig. 2d. For the FS mode, a much higher efficiency of 16.76% was realized in the CsPbI3–Crown device than 12.53% in the CsPbI3 device. Moreover, the CsPbI3–Crown PSCs presented an average PCE of RS 15.8% with a narrower distribution in comparison with CsPbI3 PSCs (RS 11.7%) (Table S3†), suggesting the excellent reproducibility of the Crown-passivated devices (Fig. 2e). The integrated currents derived from the IPCE spectra (Fig. 2f) data were 19.45 and 17.67 mA cm−2 for CsPbI3–Crown and CsPbI3 devices, respectively, which are in good agreement with the results of J–V measurements (deviation by about 5%). As expected, not only a stable efficiency output but also a fast photo-response due to the improved film quality with highly efficient charge extraction and lower charge recombination losses in the CsPbI3–Crown device were achieved (Fig. S17†). As illustrated in Fig. 2g, the CsPbI3–Crown PSCs showed obviously improved operating stability and retained 15.3% efficiency (91% of the original value) after 600 min. These results allowed us to conclude that Crown passivation did effectively lead to high performance CsPbI3 PSCs with synergistic improvements in efficiency, stability and reproducibility.
Engineering mechanism of Crown via the strong interaction
To gain insights into how the Crown passivation enhanced the performance of CsPbI3 PSCs, the interaction mechanism between Crown and CsPbI3 was investigated by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 3a, the proton resonance signal of Crown (peaked at 3.517 ppm) was shifted downfield to 3.540 ppm in CsPbI3–Crown, similar to the chemical shift of the CsI–Crown (3.537 ppm) as a reference (Fig. S18†). The 13C NMR and infrared (IR) spectra (Fig. S19 and S20†) also demonstrated the strong coordination-bonding interaction between CsPbI3 and Crown, which is consistent with the previous report.42 The 1H NMR-based quantitative analysis verified that the Crown is only ∼1 weight% of the CsPbI3–Crown film (Fig. S21†). The bonding information was also quantitatively characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Fig. 3b). The XPS doublet peaks of Cs 3d3/2 and Cs 3d5/2 were detected at the energy of 738.7 and 724.8 eV in the CsPbI3–Crown film. As compared to CsPbI3, both Cs3 d3/2 and Cs3 d5/2 peaks for CsPbI3–Crown were shifted to higher binding energies, similar to the shift from CsI to the CsI–Crown reference. The increased binding energy of Cs 3d caused by Crown bonding is ascribed to the interaction of Cs+ with O atoms on Crown.43 Meanwhile, the XPS doublet peaks of Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 were not shifted in CsPbI3–Crown films compared to those of CsPbI3 films, suggesting no obvious Crown–Pb2+ interaction in this case (Fig. S22†). On the basis of the above results, the anchoring of Crown chemically onto the CsPbI3 surface and the strong interaction with surface Cs+ ions were believed to be the main reasons for the stabilization of the CsPbI3 films and corresponding PSCs.

(b) Cs 3d XPS spectra of the CsPbI3–Crown film compared with those of CsI, CsI–Crown and CsPbI3 films. (c) Dark J–V curves of PSCs prepared using CsPbI3–Crown films for SCLC analysis with the comparison to bare CsPbI3 based devices. (d) Time-resolved PL spectra of CsPbI3–Crown and CsPbI3 films deposited on glass substrates. (e) J–V curves of PSCs prepared using CsPbI3–Crown films compared with those using bare CsPbI3 films at the reverse scan with the scan rate of 100 mV s−1 under dark conditions. 
In order to elucidate the defect passivation effect of Crown on the CsPbI3 films, space-charge-limited current (SCLC) analysis was carried out to quantitatively evaluate the trap-state densities in perovskite films (Fig. 3c).44 The SCLC measurement was performed under dark conditions with a structure of FTO/perovskite/Au. From the trap-filled limited voltage (VTFL) extracted from the J–V curves, the trap state densities of CsPbI3–Crown and CsPbI3 were estimated to be 2.49 × 1014 cm−3 and 1.73 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. The significant reduction of the defect density in CsPbI3–Crown indicated that the Crown passivation effectively suppressed nonradiative recombination in the film, which was also substantiated by the steady-state PL emission (Fig. S23†). As characterized by time-resolved PL (Fig. 3d), the longer decay time (τ) of 980 ns in the CsPbI3–Crown film than that of 745 ns in the untreated CsPbI3 film also demonstrated that the recombination loss has been effectively decreased by the Crown passivation. Moreover, significantly reduced current leakage (Fig. 3e) as well as a smaller slope in both Voc dependent curves (Fig. S24†) as a linear function of the light intensity were accomplished in the CsPbI3–Crown devices. The results well demonstrated that Crown engineering also produced a very uniform film distribution in the perovskite films, which was consistent with the obviously improved uniform PL mapping and narrower emission band in the CsPbI3–Crown film, compared with the bare CsPbI3 film (Fig. S25†).
Stability improvement by the inhibition of defect migration
Besides the moisture inhibition and defect passivation discussed above, benefitting from the strong interaction of Cs+ ions with Crown, the suppression of electric-field induced defect migration was reasonably considered to be another highly responsible reason for the operation stability improvement of the inorganic PSCs in this work. To verify the proposed electric-field driving induced defect migration and the suppression effect by Crown engineering on CsPbI3, Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) was employed to monitor local surface potentials (SP) in perovskite films with applying different bias voltages to the tip.29,45–47 It can be seen that at 0 V of bias voltage under dark conditions (Fig. 4a), the average SP value for the CsPbI3–Crown increased to −45 mV, higher than that of the bare CsPbI3 film (−197 mV), which strongly substantiated that Crown was uniformly anchored on the surface of the CsPbI3 film. With the applied bias increased, the voltage dependent average SP values (with error bar extracted from the SP images of a broad domain (16 µm2) in Fig. S26†) on the CsPbI3–Crown film present no obvious fluctuation, showing a fairly stable surface state. In comparison, the CsPbI3 film displayed a general trend that average SP values increased with the decrease of negative bias voltage. This comparison suggested that the defect migration, possibly moved using the monovalent cations (Cs+) and halide ions as carriers,48 was effectively inhibited on the CsPbI3 surface by Crown passivation.

(a) Average SP values of a CsPbI3–Crown film compared to those of the bare CsPbI3 film as a function of the bias voltage applied to the tip under dark conditions. (b) EIS measured on the surface of the CsPbI3–Crown film and CsPbI3 film using the interdigital electrodes. The equivalent circuit and co-plane electrode structure are illustrated in the inset. (c) Storage stability of unencapsulated CsPbI3–Crown and CsPbI3 devices in a chamber with constant temperature and humidity (RH 20%). Error bars represent the standard error. (d) XRD patterns of CsPbI3–Crown and CsPbI3 films in an ambient atmosphere at ∼RH 85% with different aging times. 
Here, the decreased defect migration by Crown under electric-field driving has been visually seen by the typical Cs element mapping of CsPbI3–Crown and CsPbI3 films. As shown in Fig. S27,† with decreasing the bias voltage from 0 V to −5 V, the Cs+ distribution of CsPbI3–Crown films has no obvious change (from 0 V to −3 V), and only little non-uniform distribution can be found at a bias of −5 V. In comparison, the Cs+ distribution of CsPbI3 films continually changed from 0 V to −5 V, showing that the Cs+ ions (white dots) were enriched on one side due to the electric-field driving. This result well demonstrated that the Crown has effectively stabilized the surface structure of CsPbI3 perovskites and prevented the Cs+ migration on the surface. Additionally, as revealed by surface electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Fig. 4b), the passivation increased the AC (alternating current) resistance to 1050 Ω for the CsPbI3–Crown film as compared to 782 Ω in the CsPbI3 film, further confirming that Crown anchoring has effectively decreased the ion migration, which is understandable to be responsible for the surface defect dynamics under an electric-field. These results did confirm that the Crown could effectively suppress the defect migration of CsPbI3 films under operation, thus being helpful to improve the long-term device stability of the corresponding PSCs.
Here, the long-term stability of devices under dark storage conditions was examined. As shown in Fig. 4c, the CsPbI3–Crown devices retained 14.83% efficiency (90% of its initial PCE), while CsPbI3 PSCs dropped to 4.07% efficiency after 2000 h at RH 20%, which clearly indicated that Crown has significantly improved the long-term stability of PSCs. In the accelerated aging experiments, the CsPbI3–Crown film was found to be more stable than the CsPbI3 film while exposed in a high-humidity environment (in ∼RH 85%). The intensity of XRD peaks of α-phase CsPbI3 became slightly weakened in the CsPbI3–Crown film, and only little δ phase emerged, compared with the α phase in the CsPbI3 film mostly transformed into the δ phase for over 100 min (Fig. 4d and S28†), which was consistent with the UV-vis spectra results (Fig. S29 and S30†) and previous reports.49 Furthermore, the moisture stability of perovskite films was also investigated using the 133Cs solid-state NMR spectra. It is noteworthy that the 133Cs peak intensity of α-CsPbI3 has no significant change in the CsPbI3–Crown, but is evidently weakened in the CsPbI3 which indicated that the α-CsPbI3 was partially transformed to the δ-CsPbI3 after aging for 0.5 h at ∼RH 85% (Fig. S31†). The results indicated that Crown effectively prevented CsPbI3 films from being attacked by water. To further examine the stability excluding the impact of humidity, we have tested the working stability of CsPbI3–Crown devices with CuSCN as a HTL, which retained 10.68% efficiency (91% of its original value) for 1000 h at 85 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. S32†), showing the excellent operation stability.
Mini-modules based on Crown engineered CsPbI3 films
According to the above results, Crown engineering has successfully achieved improvement in optoelectronic properties, macroscopic uniformity and moisture/operation stability for the inorganic CsPbI3 films. Thus, scalable fabrication of inorganic perovskite modules was expected considering their superior advantages over the mostly researched hybrid perovskite modules. With this concern, the protocol developed in this work was extended to prepare large area PSC modules with the structure of FTO/ZnO–ZnS/m-TiO2-perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au. A widely used patterning strategy, laser-scribing technique, was applied to produce interconnection of four sub-cells with an overall size of 4 × 4 cm2 (16 cm2) (Fig. 5a and b). The individual sub-cell is separated by means of selective ablation of P1 to P3 lines. The optimized laser-patterned monolithic series interconnection of the sub-cells is completed by the contact of bottom (FTO) and top (Au) electrodes through the P2 line. As shown in Fig. 5c, the CsPbI3–Crown based PSC module with an active area of 8 cm2 exhibited a Jsc of 4.10 mA cm−2, a Voc of 4.05 V, and a high FF of 71.45%, giving an overall PCE of RS 11.87%. In the FS scan, an efficiency of 11.25% with a Jsc of 4.01 mA cm−2, a Voc of 4.00 V, and an FF of 70.32% was achieved (Table S6†). Furthermore, the operation stability of encapsulated modules based on CsPbI3–Crown still retained 11.06% efficiency (95.2% of its origin PCE, 11.62%) over 500 h under maximum power point (MPP) tracking with continuous one-sun irradiation at RH 60% (Fig. 5d). The excellent reproducibility in the efficiencies of modules was verified according to the PCE value distribution (Fig. S33†). We have also further demonstrated the modified blade coating method50 as a potential scaling up method to fabricate large-area CsPbI3 films, and then achieved RS 10.73% and FS 10.54% efficiencies based on a 16 cm2 module (Fig. S34†). This represents the first demonstration of the feasibility of using all-inorganic perovskite films to realize PSC modules with decent performance, showing the great potential of this passivation strategy for the fabrication of stable and large-area PSCs. A detailed fair review on previously reported representative work of CsPbI3-based PSCs has also been listed in Table S7† for comparison. Our work is currently among the best reported and presents an obvious improvement in module area and operation stability.

Conclusions
In summary, a coordination manipulation of a functionalized additive on CsPbI3 was proposed and successfully carried out through passivating and stabilizing the high-quality α-phase CsPbI3 derived from Crown and a PbI2·NMP compound. It was experimentally demonstrated that due to the strong interaction between Crown and surface Cs+ ions, the moisture invasion was effectively inhibited as well as the surface ion migration, thus improving the phase stability and reducing the defects in the cubic structured CsPbI3 films. Further results evidenced that the additionally suppressed defect migration via the Crown anchoring also strongly contributes to the obviously improved long-term stability of the films. Therefore, a champion efficiency of 16.9% was achieved in the correspondingly fabricated devices, and the first all-inorganic perovskite module with a large-area (16 cm2) was successfully fabricated with an efficiency of over 11.8% and excellent operation stability. This work will pave a straight-forward and convenient avenue to design high-performance inorganic or hybrid perovskite-based devices for practical applications, such as solar cells, light-emitting diodes, photodetectors, and scintillators.
Experimental
Materials
Chlorobenzene (CB), CsI, PbI2, 2-methoxyethanol, CuSCN, diethyl sulfide, and 1,4,7,10,13,16-hexaoxacyclooctadecane (18-crown-6, shortly denoted as Crown) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Zinc acetate, thiourea, monoethanolamine, ethanol, acetonitrile, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), hydriodic acid (HI) (49% in water) and isopropanol (IPA) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Regent Co., Ltd. TiO2 paste and Spiro-OMeTAD were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology in China.
Synthesis of CsI–Crown
CsI–Crown was synthesized by reacting 260 mg CsI, 264 mg Crown and 20 mL ethanol in a 250 mL beaker at room temperature for 3 hours with stirring. The white solids were gradually precipitated. The precipitate was recrystallized using diethyl ether, and finally dried at 100 °C in a vacuum oven for 48 hours to fully remove water.
Synthesis of CsPbI3·Crown crystals
CsPbI3·Crown crystals were synthesized by reacting 260 mg CsI, 461 mg PbI2 and 26 mg Crown in a 250 mL beaker at 170 °C for 10 hours while stirring. Needle-like crystals were gradually grown. Then, the precursor solution was filtered away to collect the CsPbI3·Crown crystals. The crystal was resolved by single-crystal X-ray diffraction as shown in Fig. S7.† CCDC 1978630.
Synthesis of the PbI2·NMP compound
The PbI2·NMP compound was synthesized according to a previously report method.51 Briefly, PbI2 and NMP (equal molar quantity) were stirred in a 100 mL beaker at 0 °C for 1 day. The PbI2·NMP precipitate was collected, and then recrystallized using diethyl ether, and finally dried at 120 °C in a vacuum oven for 48 hours.
Solar cell fabrication
A compact ZnO–ZnS electron transporting layer (ETL) was deposited onto cleaned FTO glass (NSG, Tec-7) following a previously reported method.41 First, a compact ZnO ETL was spray-coated onto the hot FTO substrate using 0.37 M zinc acetate and monoethanolamine (molar ratio 1:1) in ethanol solution at 400 °C for 30 min. Second, the FTO with the ZnO ETL was immersed into an ethanol solution of thiourea (76 mg mL−1) at 70 °C for 10 min, and then annealed in air at 400 °C for 30 min to obtain the ZnO–ZnS ETL. A mesoporous TiO2 film was deposited on the ZnO–ZnS/FTO substrate by spin-coating TiO2 paste (1:5, mass ratio) at 5000 rpm for 20 s, and annealed at 400 °C for 30 min. For the CsPbI3 perovskite layer, a mixture solution of 1.0 mmol PbI2·NMP compound and 1.0 mmol CsI in 1 mL DMF with an additive (30 µL HI) was spun onto the substrates at 4000 rpm for 30 s, and then 100 µL CB was dropped on the spinning substrate 10 s prior to the end of the process. Finally, the substrate with the CsPbI3 film was heated at 170 °C for 30 min. For the Crown passivation process, the Crown solution was prepared by dissolving 1 mg Crown in 1 mL of IPA, and then dripped on the CsPbI3 film (4000 rpm, 30 s). Finally, the above substrate was heated at 100 °C for 10 min. After preparation of the CsPbI3 film, a 20 µL drop from the CB solution (each milliliter containing 73.2 mg Spiro-OMeTAD, 8.6 µL of Li-TFSI/acetonitrile (520 mg mL−1) and 14.4 µL of TBP) was coated via the solution process at 4000 rpm for 10 s to get the hole transport layer (HTL).52 The fabrication process of the inorganic HTL, CuSCN, was carried out in accordance with reported work.53 First, the CuSCN solution was prepared by dissolving 20 mg CuSCN in 1 mL of diethyl sulfide after continuous stirring at 40 °C for 50 min, and then dripped within 5 s on the perovskite substrate spinning at 4000 rpm. Finally, the above substrate was heated at 50 °C for 30 min. Finally, 60 nm of Au was prepared via thermal evaporation. The active area was defined by a 0.1 cm2 mask. The perovskite deposition was carried out in a homemade glovebox under controlled atmospheric conditions by using compressed dry air to recirculate ventilation and purify the fabrication atmosphere. After several recirculating purification, the relative humidity could be retained at a value about 10–15%.
Fabrication of 16 cm2 CsPbI3–Crown modules
The module consisting of four sub-cells connected in series was scribed using a laser engraving machine (ZNL1810V2, Hangzhou Zhongneng Optoelectronic Technology Co., Ltd., China). For fabrication of PSC modules, three laser-patterning lines, P1 (500 µm), P2 (250 µm), and P3 (350 µm) were accomplished by a laser with a power of 18 W, 10 W and 7 W, respectively. The active area of PSC modules was calculated to be 8.0 cm2 without the mask. For the spin coating of large-area CsPbI3 perovskite films, all procedures were consistent with the small-cell case by the same method. For the blade coating of CsPbI3 perovskite films, a 4 µL droplet of CsPbI3 precursor was added into the gap (∼200 µm) between the blade and substrate, and then the blade was moved on with a speed of ∼200 mm s−1. Next, the wet films were transferred into a vacuum chamber in a short time, and quickly pumped to ∼10−2 Pa from atmospheric pressure within 15 s, and then maintained for 1 min at this pressure. After the vacuum-flash process, the substrate was transferred to a hotplate for 30 min annealing at 170 °C. For the Crown passivation process, 5 µL of Crown/IPA solution (1 mg mL−1) was loaded in the gap (around 100 µm) between the blade and the CsPbI3 surface, and the blade was moved at a speed of ∼50 mm s−1. Then the above substrate was annealed on a hotplate at 100 °C for 10 min. The perovskite deposition was carried out in a homemade glovebox under controlled atmospheric conditions with relative humidity 10–15%. All procedures were consistent with the small-cell case.
Operation stability of CsPbI3–Crown modules
The Maximum-power-point (MPP) of the encapsulated module was determined by the J–V scan using a Keithley 2400 source meter under AM 1.5 simulated solar irradiation (white LED light, LSH-7320, Newport) and the Vmax was obtained at the corresponding maximum power point (MPP) for the device. In the MPP tracking, a bias voltage equal to the Vmax was applied on the device to simulate the max-power-output for the device to evaluate the operation stability. The storage conditions during operation were maintained at 25 °C by a Peltier element and a relative humidity of 60%.
Characterization
The J–V characteristics of PSCs were analyzed on a solar simulator (Newport, Class 3A, 84023A) under AM 1.5 G standard light (100 mW cm−2) equipped with a Keithley 2400 source meter. The IPCE spectra were measured on an IPCE system (Newport) equipped with a Xenon lamp (66920, Newport, 300 W xenon lamp), a monochromator (Cornerstone 260, Newport) and a power meter (2936-R, Newport). The perovskite films were analyzed on an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, SmartLab-SE) with a Cu Kα radiation source. Surface and cross-sectional morphologies and EDS maps of the perovskite films were obtained on a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) (ZEISS, Sigma). The UV-vis spectra were recorded on a UV-2550 UV-vis spectrophotometer. IR spectra were collected on an infrared spectrometer instrument (Thermo Fisher, Nicolet iS50). The trap state density of perovskite films, CsPbI3 and CsPbI3–Crown films, with the typical configuration (FTO/perovskite/Au) was evaluated using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model.54–56 The steady and time-resolved PL spectra were measured using an FLS980 (Edinburgh) fluorescence spectrometer excited by a 377.6 nm pulsed laser. PL mapping measurements were performed on a laser Raman microscope (RAMAN-11, Nanophoton). Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) of perovskite films with surface potential and topography characteristics was performed on an atomic force microscope equipped with a controller using a Pt/Ir-coated Si tip. Water contact angles were measured on an optical contact-angle meter system. The 133Cs solid-state MAS (magic angle spinning) NMR spectra were collected on a Bruker Avance III 400 MHz NMR spectrometer with a 4.0 mm probe under spinning rates from 12 kHz at room temperature (298 K). The diffraction data of CsPbI3·Crown were collected on an Agilent SuperNove X-ray single crystal diffractometer using Cu Kα (λ= 1.54184 Å) micro-focus X-ray sources at 100 K.
