    , Accepted 29th November 2017First published on 1st December 2017AbstractOrganic hole transport layers (HTL) play a very important role for realizing high performance and low-cost planar p–i–n perovskite solar cells (pero-SCs). In this work, we synthesized two X-shaped organic HTL materials, Si-OMeTPA and SiTP-OMeTPA, with silicon cores and triphenylamine (TPA) derivative branches. This molecular design strategy can substantially simplify synthetic procedures making them available for reducing device costs. This is particularly applicable for Si-OMeTPA since it can be synthesized by two steps from commercial raw materials showing a total yield of over 60%. This molecularly designed Si-OMeTPA possesses advantages of high thermal stability, high crystallinity with a long range ordered lamellar structure, and excellent hole mobility. The resulting HTL can also facilitate the sequential growth of high-quality perovskite films, giving a significantly enhanced photovoltaic performance with a best power conversion efficiency of 19.06%, which is one of the highest PCE among the planar p–i–n pero-SCs to date. In addition, the devices exhibit negligible hysteresis, good reproducibility, and stability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of an easily synthesized HTL material in planar p–i–n pero-SCs that shows superior performance relative to the well-known poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine) (PTAA) HTL.
1. Introduction
Planar p–i–n organic–metal halide perovskite solar cells (pero-SCs) with a low-temperature-processed organic/polymer hole transport layer (HTL) on ITO as the bottom electrode have attracted great attention in recent years because of their high efficiency and less hysteresis of photovoltaic performance, low cost, and easy fabrication by low temperature solution-processing.1–5 In the p–i–n pero-SCs, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) is the most commonly used organic HTL material. But the PEDOT:PSS-based p–i–n pero-SCs shows poor long-term stability due to its acidic and hygroscopic nature,6 and lower open-circuit voltage (Voc) (0.90–0.95 V)7 due to an energy mismatch between PEDOT:PSS HTL and the perovskite photoactive layer. Therefore, exploiting a neutral and hydrophobic organic/polymer HTL possessing matched energy levels is particularly important to fully unveil the potential of p–i–n pero-SCs. Many HTL materials such as poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT),8 poly[N,N′-bis(4-butylphenyl)-N,N′-bis(phenyl)benzidine] (poly-TPD),9 polytriarylamine (PTAA),10–12 1,4′-bis(4-(di-ptoyl)aminostyryl)benzene (TPASB),13 TAPC,14 Trux-OMeTAD,15 and PhNa-1T16 have been exploited to enhance the Voc and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the p–i–n pero-SCs. But we still need to develop new HTL materials with easy synthesis and highly reproducible photovoltaic performance.
X-shaped organic molecule HTL materials as shown in Fig. 1a, consisting of a core and four branches, have drawn particular interest for the n–i–p pero-SCs due to their well-defined structure, easier purification, and fine-tuned energy levels. For example, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)9,9′-spiro-bifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) and its analogues17,18 as top HTLs in n–i–p pero-SCs demonstrated high photovoltaic performance with the highest PCE over 20%.19,20 However, they usually require additives to improve their conductivities21 which makes the device processing complicated and results in hysteresis and poorer device stability. Besides, the spiro or fused-ring core derivatives are expensive when considering future applications. More recently, Li et al. reported a series of X-shaped HTL materials (such as TPP-SMeTAD or TPP-OMeTAD) using a 3-D triphenylamine (TPA) moiety as branches and p-xylene as a core, and using them in p–i–n pero-SCs. The resulting HTLs can efficiently enhance charge extraction and passivate surface traps of a perovskite film, realizing a PCE of over 16% for the p–i–n pero-SCs.22 However, the PCE of the p–i–n pero-SCs needs to be further improved and the structure–property relationships between the HTL materials and the perovskite films remain poorly understood.

Silicon-containing organic semiconductor materials have been known to exhibit altered properties with respect to their carbon analogues,23,24 which have been reported to show promising characteristics as photoactive layer materials for thin-film transistors25 and polymer solar cells.26 It was demonstrated that incorporation of silicon atoms in organic semiconductor materials can be used to optimize molecular orbital shapes and energies, as well as molecule packing properties by a rational molecule design.27 However, this promising strategy for designing HTL materials for planar p–i–n pero-SCs has not yet been reported.
In this work, two X-shaped small molecule HTMs, named SiTP-OMeTPA and Si-OMeTPA (see Fig. 1), were developed and used in planar p–i–n pero-SCs. In the molecules, two silicon-based derivatives (tetraphenylsilane or a silicon atom) are employed as the cores, and TPA with methoxyl end groups are used as the four branches. This molecular design strategy can substantially reduce the expensive synthetic procedure and improve the overall yields. In particular, chosing a silicon atom as core for Si-OMeTPA plays an important role in simplifying the synthetic procedure with a straightforward two-step synthesis from commercial raw materials. In addition, a silicon atom core can stabilize electronic properties of the molecules due to the high bond interaction between the low-lying σ* orbital of the silicon atom and the π* orbital of the neighboring conjugated moiety.28 As a result, Si-OMeTPA exhibits high crystallinity, excellent thermal stability, as well as appropriate energy levels to transfer holes. The p–i–n planar pero-SCs with the Si-OMeTPA HTL showed a high PCE of 19.06% with negligible hysteresis and excellent device stability. To our best knowledge, 19.06% is one of the highest PCE among the planar p–i–n pero-SCs to date.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis and physicochemical properties
The synthetic routes of SiTP-OMeTPA and Si-OMeTPA are shown in Schemes S1 and S2† respectively, and the detailed synthetic processes are described in the Experimental section. Molecular structures of the two molecules were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectra and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, as shown in Fig. S1–S6 in ESI.† Briefly, tetrakis(4-bromophenyl)silane was synthesized by the reaction of SiCl4 and 1,4-dibromobenzene with an 83.2% yield. Then it was coupled with two different arylamines (OMeTPA-BPIN and bis-OMeAm) through Suzuki coupling or a Buchwald–Hartwig reaction, giving the target SiTP-OMeTPA and Si-OMeTPA with yields of 70.2% and 72.6%, respectively. It is worth noting that Si-OMeTPA can be synthesized by only two steps with a total yield over 60%. Meanwhile, the two materials are readily soluble in common organic solvents such as chlorobenzene (CB) and chloroform but insoluble in water and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). From this point of view, SiTP-OMeTPA and Si-OMeTPA are suitable to be used as the HTL of p–i–n pero-SCs. It is worth mentioning that we also roughly estimated the synthesis cost of 1 g Si-OMeTPA and SiTP-OMeTPA according to the cost model that is described by Petrus et al.29 and Osedach et al.30 As shown in Tables S2 and S3 in ESI,† the estimated synthesis cost of Si-OMeTPA and SiTP-OMeTPA are ca. $29.57 per g and $35.1 per g, respectively, which are much cheaper than that of PTAA ($423.3 per g).
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to further investigate electronic structures of the two silicon based HTL materials. As shown in Fig. 1b and c, the electron density of Si-OMeTPA is more fully delocalized within the whole molecule than that of SiTP-OMeTPA owing to the higher bond interaction between the low-lying σ* orbital of the silicon atom and π* orbital of the conjugated TPA moiety. Moreover, incorporation of a silicon atom in the centers of SiTP-OMeTPA and Si-OMeTPA can also stabilize their electronic properties, as evidenced from the strong reversibility of redox peaks in the electrochemical cyclic voltammetry test (Fig. S7 in ESI†).
Both silicon based materials exhibit good thermal stability, with decomposition temperatures of 435 °C for SiTP-OMeTPA and 426 °C for Si-OMeTPA, at 5% weight loss (Fig. S8 in ESI†). Meanwhile, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms (see Fig. 2a) revealed that SiTP-OMeTPA is amorphous in nature (glass transition temperature (Tg) detected at 147 °C). While Si-OMeTPA shows a melting peak at around 345 °C and crystallization peak at around 323 °C during the heating and cooling process, respectively, which indicates Si-OMeTPA is crystalline after thermal annealing. These results can be further confirmed by the red-shifted maximum absorption peak of the annealed Si-OMeTPA film (at 150 °C for 30 min), while the amorphous SiTP-OMeTPA shows an almost unchanged absorption spectrum (see Fig. 2b). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the Si-OMeTPA film on a silicon wafer (see Fig. 2c) shows (100), (200), and (300) three diffraction peaks, revealing a lamellar molecular packing structure with a long range order in the crystalline state.31,32 Meanwhile, this ordered structure could be well maintained even adding 3 wt% 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4-TCNQ) additive. In comparison, the SiTP-OMeTPA films show no diffraction peaks, even after thermal annealing, due to its amorphous nature (Fig. S9 in ESI†).

A space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method was then used to investigate the effect of molecular packing structure on hole mobilities (μh) of SiTP-OMeTPA and Si-OMeTPA films. As shown in Fig. 2d and Table 1, the μh of the thermally annealed Si-OMeTPA film shows more than one order of magnitude higher than that of the as-cast film, due to the formation of long range ordered lamellar structure in the crystalized Si-OMeTPA film after thermal annealing. The μh was further enhanced by adding 3 wt% F4-TCNQ additive, resulting in a μh of 2.96 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The result agrees well with the resistance reduction of PTAA HTL by doping F4-TCNQ.33 Although the amorphous SiTP-OMeTPA films also showed an increased μh after thermal annealing and doping F4-TCNQ, the relatively lower values indicate the molecular arrangement can dramatically influence hole transport ability. Therefore, it can be concluded that the long range ordered lamellar structure of the crystalized Si-OMeTPA film is one of the ideal structures for π-conjugated molecules to facilitate vertical hole transport.

Transmittance and matched energy levels of the HTLs are also important factors that significantly affect current density and charge extraction ability of the pero-SCs. As shown in Fig. 3a, ITO coated with 30 nm-thick Si-OMeTPA film showed almost the same transmittance, while the SiTP-OMeTPA and control PTAA films led to an obviously decreased transmittance in the wavelength range of 340–430 nm. This result reveals that the Si-OMeTPA film is a superior candidate for the HTL of p–i–n pero-SC without loss of incident light. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was then used to accurately evaluate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels34 of the two silicon based HTLs on ITO. The cutoff (Ecutoff) and onset (Ei) energy regions in the UPS spectra are shown in Fig. 3b and c, respectively. According to the equation ϕ = 21.2 − (Ecutoff − Ei),35 the HOMO energy levels of SiTP-OMeTPA and Si-OMeTPA were calculated to be −5.34 and −5.39 eV, respectively. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of −2.30 eV for SiTP-OMeTPA and −1.96 eV for Si-OMeTPA were obtained from their corresponding optical bandgaps (3.04 eV and 3.43 eV) and HOMO energy levels. Compared with the work function or HOMO energy level of a conventional HTL, such as −5.12 eV of PEDOT:PSS and −5.13 eV of PTAA,36,37 the deeper HOMO energy level of SiTP-OMeTPA and Si-OMeTPA, closing to the valence band (VB) of MAPbI3 (5.4 eV), could enhance charge transfer from MAPbI3 to the HTL via an energetically favorable pathway without a significant loss in energy. Meanwhile, the higher LUMO (−2.3 eV and −1.96 eV) of the two silicon based HTLs can also effectively block electrons to prevent recombination at the anode.

UPS spectra in the cutoff (b) and the onset (c) energy regions of SiTP-OMeTPA and Si-OMeTPA films. (d) Images of the water and DMF droplets contact angles on different surfaces of the HTLs. 
In addition, surface wettability of HTLs has a significant impact on the quality of the subsequent growth of perovskite film in fabrication of the p–i–n pero-SCs. Generally, polar solvents have good wettability on the surface of conventional HTLs like PEDOT:PSS, as confirmed by the small contact angles of a water droplet (19.7°, Fig. 3d). Recent reports reveal that a non-wetting HTL (such as PTAA) surface can facilitate the growth of high-aspect-ratio crystalline grain perovskite films and thus lead to higher photovoltaic performance of the pero-SCs.38 Fortunately, as shown in Fig. 3d, the two silane-containing HTLs exhibit a comparable surface wettability with that of PTAA (contact angle of a water droplet (θ) = 87.2°), particularly Si-OMeTPA shows the same contact angle (θ = 87.2°) with that of PTAA. We then further used a DMF droplet instead of water to measure contact angles for accurately evaluating wettability of a PbI2 precursor. It can be seen that the contact angles of DMF droplets on different HTL surfaces are obviously smaller than those of water droplets due to the lower polarity of DMF, but exhibit a similar trend except that the contact angles on the surfaces of Si-OMeTPA and SiTP-OMeTPA are slightly lower than that on the PTAA surface.5 Therefore, it can be expected that improved hydrophily of two silane-containing HTL materials will facilitate PbI2 deposition from DMF solution leading to a full coverage of perovskite materials.39 Such HTLs with balanced wettability should be beneficial for achieving high-quality perovskite films.
2.2 Photovoltaic properties
Based on the above results, we then fabricated planar p–i–n pero-SCs with a structure of glass/ITO/HTL/MAPbI3/PCBM/Al. As shown in Fig. 4a, the MAPbI3 film can grow well on the hydrophobic surfaces of SiTP-OMeTPA and Si-OMeTPA films showing compact and homogeneous perovskite morphologies, in particular for the MAPbI3 film grown on Si-OMeTPA showing a larger average grain size over ∼600 nm. Accordingly, in the cross-section SEM image of a Si-OMeTPA based device, a thick perovskite layer (∼420 nm) with grain boundaries perpendicular to the substrate is obtained, which can effectively minimize the grain boundary energy.5 It can be seen from Fig. 4a that all functional layers can be clearly distinguished, confirming that the planar heterojunction configuration was well formed in the pero-SCs. XRD patterns are commonly used to evaluate the quality of a perovskite film in the pero-SCs. Fig. S10 in ESI† shows the XRD patterns of MAPbI3 grown on the Si-OMeTPA and SiTP-OMeTPA HTLs. It can be seen that the diffraction peak at 12.4° (assigned to the (001) plane of PbI2) is weaker for the MAPbI3 film grown on Si-OMeTPA than that on SiTP-OMeTPA, indicating a lower PbI2 content and more complete perovskite phase of the photoactive layer prepared on the Si-OMeTPA HTL. Low PbI2 content has been found to be beneficial for perovskite photovoltaics due to its passivation effect at grain boundaries that reduces charge recombination.40Fig. 4b provides the energy-level diagram of the related materials in the pero-SCs. As the CB of perovskite is −5.40 eV,7 both SiTP-OMeTPA and Si-OMeTPA HTLs show a perfect energy band alignment with the perovskite photoactive layer with a small HOMO energy level offset, for efficient hole transfer and collection from the photoactive layer to the HTL.

(c) J–V curves of the planar p–i–n pero-SCs based on different HTLs. (d) The steady-state PL spectra and (e) TRPL decay transient spectra of the perovskite films prepared on ITO or different HTLs coated substrate. aThermally annealed HTL at 150 °C for 30 min. bHTL doped with 3 wt% F4-TCNQ then thermally annealed at 150 °C for 30 min. 

Fig. 4c shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of pero-SCs with SiTP-OMeTPA and Si-OMeTPA HTLs treated by different conditions, under the illumination of AM1.5G 100 mW cm−2, and Table 1 listed the photovoltaic parameters data of the corresponding pero-SCs. The pero-SCs with the as-cast HTL exhibited quite poor PCE of 6.85% for the device with SiTP-OMeTPA HTL and 8.58% for Si-OMeTPA HTL with a low Voc, short circuit current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF), which could be attributed to the low hole mobilities of the as-cast HTLs (1.39 × 10−6 for SiTP-OMeTPA HTL and 4.24 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for Si-OMeTPA HTL).41 After thermal annealing of the HTLs at 150 °C for 30 min before depositing perovskite films, the PCEs of the SiTP-OMeTPA and Si-OMeTPA based devices were dramatically increased to 11.2% and 12.89%, respectively, which could be ascribed to significantly enhanced hole mobilities of the HTLs that improves ohmic contact and charge extraction ability of the device. For the devices based on HTLs with 3 wt% F4-TCNQ and thermal annealing (doped/annealed), the PCEs of the pero-SCs with SiTP-OMeTPA and Si-OMeTPA HTLs were further improved to 14.15% and 18.23%, respectively. Notably, the Si-OMeTPA HTL-based pero-SCs exhibit ∼30% higher PCEs than that of the SiTP-OMeTPA-based devices. The superior photovoltaic performance of the Si-OMeTPA HTL could be attributed to its higher μh and higher transparency originating from a long range ordered lamellar phase structure and more fully delocalized electron in Si-OMeTPA.
The charge transfer properties of the pero-SCs were further investigated by steady-state PL spectra and time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurements, as showed in Fig. 4d and e, and Table S1 in ESI.† The perovskite film shows the strongest PL quenching and reduced life time (22.35 ns) when deposited on the doped/annealed Si-OMeTPA HTL in comparison to those on the as-cast Si-OMeTPA, annealed Si-OMeTPA, and even the doped/annealed SiTP-OMeTPA HTLs. This means that the excitons produced in the perovskite film can be easily dissociated and the holes can be more efficiently extracted by the doped/annealed Si-OMeTPA HTL. These results agree with the improved photovoltaic performance of the pero-SCs with the doped/annealed Si-OMeTPA HTL. In addition, from the obviously improved Jsc and FF for the doped/annealed Si-OMeTPA based device, we can also conclude that the crystalized Si-OMeTPA with dopant has fewer traps in it or at the surface of Si-OMeTPA/perovskite, which facilitates charge transportation and suppresses charge recombination.
In order to understand the device operation mechanism of the p–i–n pero-SCs, plots of photocurrent (Jph) versus the effective applied voltage (Veff) for the devices were measured to investigate the influence of different HTLs (doped/annealed SiTP-OMeTPA and Si-OMeTPA) on exciton dissociation and charge collection. As can be seen from Fig. 5a, when Veff arrives at ∼2 V, Jph then values for the two devices reach saturation (Jsat), suggesting that charge recombination is minimized at higher voltage due to the high internal electric field in the devices. Charge extraction probability (CEP) can be calculated from the ratio of Jph/Jsat.42 We can find that the CEP increases from 0.923 to 0.944 by changing doped/annealed SiTP-OMeTPA to doped/annealed Si-OMeTPA HTL. This result indicates better charge extraction ability of pero-SC can be achieved by using the crystalized Si-OMeTPA HTL with long range ordered lamellar structure.
 Fig. 5  (a) Charge collection probability as a function of internal voltage. (b) Light intensity-dependence of Voc for the pero-SCs with the doped/annealed SiTP-OMeTPA or Si-OMeTPA HTLs. 

Fig. 5b shows the charge recombination kinetics of our devices by measuring Voc varied logarithmically (ln(I)) with light intensity. Slopes for the devices with the doped/annealed SiTP-OMeTPA and doped/annealed Si-OMeTPA HTL are 1.43kT/e and 1.19kT/e, respectively. The significantly decreased slope of the device with the doped/annealed Si-OMeTPA HTL, that is close to the trap-free device with a slope of 1.0kT/e,43,44 indicates a reduced trap state in the perovskite film. This could be ascribed to a result that the doped/annealed Si-OMeTPA HTL is more beneficial for the growth of MAPbI3 with fewer traps, which can effectively depress the charge carriers recombination and thus achieve higher device performance.
In order to further improve photovoltaic performance of the p–i–n pero-SCs with the doped/annealed Si-OMeTPA as HTL, we used thermally evaporated C60/bathocuproine (BCP) double layers as cathode buffer layer in the device; we considered that the BCP film as an exciton-transporting and hole-blocking layer could realize enhancement of device performance.45 The device structure is glass/ITO/Si-OMeTPA/MAPbI3/PCBM/C60 (20 nm)/BCP (5 nm)/Ag. As shown in Fig. 6a and Table 1, the devices showed a further improved PCE of 19.06% measured in the reverse scan direction, with a Jsc of 23.08 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.07 V, and a FF of 77.17% which is quite consistent with the PCE measured in the forward scan direction (18.68%), with a Jsc of 22.98 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.07 V and a FF of 75.97%, indicating negligible J–V hysteresis. This performance enhancement and negligible hysteresis behavior could be attributed to a well-grown perovskite film on the Si-OMeTPA HTL and the improved electron-collection and hole-blocking property of the C60/BCP double cathode buffer layers.
 Fig. 6  (a) J–V curves of the pero-SCs with Si-OMeTPA as HTL and C60/BCP as double cathode buffer layers in reverse and forward scans measured under the illumination of AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. Forward scan: −0.2 V → 1.2 V, scan rate 200 mV s−1, delay time 100 ms; reverse scan: 1.2 V → −0.2 V, scan rate 200 mV s−1, delay time 100 ms. (b) EQE spectra of the corresponding pero-SCs. (c) Histograms of device PCE measured for 50 corresponding pero-SCs. (d) The plot of PCE values versus synthetic steps of organic HTLs used for the MAPbI3 based p–i–n pero-SCs reported in literatures and this work. 
External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the corresponding pero-SCs are shown in Fig. 6b. The Jsc value calculated from integration of the EQE spectrum was 21.9 mA cm−2, which agrees well with the Jsc value obtained from the J–V curve within 5% deviation. Fig. 6c shows a histogram of the PCE values of 50 devices. Half of the devices based on the doped/annealed Si-OMeTPA as HTL and with the C60/BCP double cathode buffer layers demonstrated PCEs over 18.0%. Fig. 6d plots PCE values versus synthetic steps of the HTLs used for the p–i–n pero-SCs reported in literatures and this work. It can be seen that 19.06% is the highest PCE in the planar p–i–n pero-SCs with the HTL synthesized by only two steps, indicating that Si-OMeTPA is a promising cheap HTL material for future application of the p–i–n pero-SCs. It is worth noting that this PCE is only lower than the highest reported value of the device with PTAA HTL for the MAPbI3 system, where additive and antisolvent dripping treatments were simultaneously employed to further improve the quality of MAPbI3 film.12 However, these treatments need stringent processing and a toxic solvent, in particular for the antisolvent technology, which are unfavorable for large-area solar cell fabrication and device reproducibility. Encouragingly, when fabricating devices under the same conditions (without additional treatments to MAPbI3), the Si-OMeTPA HTL-based device showed an approximately 10% enhanced PCE and slightly higher Voc compared to that of the device using PTAA as HTL (PCE of 17.47% consistent with previous reports,10,33 see in Fig. S11, ESI†), which probably is attributed to the well grown perovskite film on Si-OMeTPA as well as better matched device energy levels.
Stability of the pero-SCs is an another critical issue for their applications. First, we investigated the effect of intrinsic thermal annealing stability of the Si-OMeTPA HTL on the performance of the p–i–n pero-SCs. Considering decomposition of the perovskite film and F4-TCNQ at high thermal annealing temperatures, Si-OMeTPA without dopant was thermally annealed at different temperatures (100–200 °C) with different times (5–30 min), and then used as HTL to fabricate the device directly. As shown in Fig. S12 in ESI,† PCEs of devices with the Si-OMeTPA HTL exhibit only slight variation with increasing thermal annealed temperature and with extending annealing time on the HTL, indicating a promising thermal stability of the Si-OMeTPA HTL without influencing its long range ordered lamellar structure as well as electronic coupling between Si-OMeTPA and MAPbI3. For planar p–i–n pero-SCs, the chemical stability of HTL is also particularly important due to its influence on the interfaces between the HTL and perovskite film and between the HTL and ITO or FTO bottom transparent electrode. Storage stability of the p–i–n pero-SCs based on Si-OMeTPA HTL and control PEDOT:PSS HTL without encapsulation were studied in nitrogen and ambient atmospheres, respectively, as shown in Fig. 7. In the nitrogen atmosphere, the PCE of the control pero-SC based on PEDOT:PSS HTL degraded to 74% of its initial value when kept in the dark condition for 500 h (see Fig. 7a), while the Si-OMeTPA HTL-based device retained over 92% of its initial PCE. One possible reason responsible for the improved device stability could be ascribed to the neutral characteristic of the Si-OMeTPA HTL, which can effectively prevent corrosion against ITO and perovskite films. To investigate stability of the devices in ambient atmosphere, we fabricated the pero-SCs using a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS or Si-OMeTPA/perovskite/PCBM/C60/BCP/Ag, and the unencapsulated devices were stored under ambient atmosphere with a ∼60–80% relative humidity (RH). As shown in Fig. 7b, after 130 h exposure, the Si-OMeTPA-based device retained almost 90% of its initial PCE, while the PCE of the PEDOT:PSS-based devices dramatically degraded to 49%. We could attribute the obviously enhanced stability of the Si-OMeTPA-based devices to the hydrophobicity of the Si-OMeTPA HTL, which will protect the MAPbI3 layer from water ingress.

3. Conclusion
In conclusion, we synthesized two low-cost X-shaped organic molecules, Si-OMeTPA and SiTP-OMeTPA, with a silicon core and TPA branches, and used them as HTL in planar p–i–n pero-SCs. Among the two HTLs, Si-OMeTPA can be simply synthesized in two steps from commercial raw materials with a total yield of over 60%, and possesses excellent thermal stability and high crystallinity with a long range ordered lamellar structure and higher μh. Therefore, the Si-OMeTPA HTL allows us to simultaneously address several major challenges of p–i–n pero-SCs, including facilitating the growth of high-quality and less trap states polycrystalline perovskite films as well as improving hole extracting ability and band alignment at interfaces. As a result, the p–i–n pero-SCs with the doped/annealed Si-OMeTPA as HTL and C60/BCP as double cathode buffer layers showed significantly enhanced PCE of 19.06% with negligible hysteresis behavior and high stability. These results indicate that Si-OMeTPA is a promising low-cost HTL material for future applications of the p–i–n pero-SCs.

4.2 Measurements and instruments

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were measured using a Varian Mercury-400 NMR. Time-of-flight mass spectra were recorded with a Bruker MALDI-TOF mass system. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a Discovery-TG, with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under nitrogen flow. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed under nitrogen flushing at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 with a Discovery-DSC Q20. Electrochemical measurements of the two HTL materials were performed with a Bioanalytical Systems BAS100 B/W electrochemical workstation. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) diagrams of the HTMs were obtained by using n-Bu4NPF6 as supporting electrolyte in acetonitrile solution with a glass carbon working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) reference electrode under N2 atmosphere. UPS was tested by a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD. PL was tested by a FLS980 (Edinburgh Instrument, UK), and transient photoluminescence measurements also used the FLS980 (Edinburgh Instrument, UK) at a wavelength of 768 nm. XRD patterns were collected using X'Pert Pro MPD (PANalytical B.V.). The SEM images were collected on a SU8010 produced by Hitachi, where the electron beam was accelerated at 5 kV. The J–V characteristics of the devices were measured with a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit under the illumination of an AM1.5G white light source with the optical power at the sample being 100 mW cm−2; the light intensity was corrected by a standard silicon solar cell. The EQE was obtain using a solar cell spectral response measurement system (Enli Technology Co., Ltd., QE-R3011). The light intensity at each wavelength was also calibrated with a standard Si solar cell. Transmittance and reflection spectra were measured with an Ultraviolet Spectrometer (Agilent Technologies Cary 5000 UV-Vis-NIR).
4.3 Device fabrication
ITO glass substrates were sequentially washed with isopropanol, acetone, distilled water, and ethanol for 20 min, then dried with N2. The synthesized HTL materials (Si-OMeTPA and SiTP-OMeTPA) and control PTAA were dissolved in CB with a concentration of 5 mg mL−1 and 10 mg mL−1, respectively. Then, they were spin-coated on the ITO/glass substrates at a speed of 6000 rpm for 30 s. For the doped HTLs, the 3 wt% and 1 wt% F4-TCNQ were added into synthesized HTL materials and PTAA solution, respectively, before depositing. The resulting HTLs were thermally annealed at 150 °C for 30 min (Si-OMeTPA and SiTP-OMeTPA) and 100 °C for 10 min (PTAA). The perovskite layer was fabricated by a two-step method. PbI2:MAI precursor solution (35 μL, molar ratio = 1.3:0.3, dissolved in DMF/DMSO, volume ratio = 9:1) was stirred at 70 °C overnight on a hot plate. On the top of the HTL, the PbI2:MAI precursor solution was firstly spin-coated at 6000 rpm for 15 s. Then MAI solution (40 μL, 35 mg mL−1, dissolved in 2-propanol) was spin-coated at 3700 rpm for 45 s on PbI2:MAI film. After that, the deposited films were thermally annealed at 100 °C for 30 min in a nitrogen-filled glove-box. The resulting perovskite films were coated with PCBM film by spin-coating 20 mg mL−1 PCBM solution (in CB) at 2000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, an Al (100 nm) electrode or C60 (20 nm)/BCP (5 nm)/Ag (100 nm) was deposited on the PCBM by vacuum evaporation under 1 × 10−6 mbar.
