    , Accepted 26th March 2018First published on 27th March 2018AbstractPhase change materials (PCMs) have been extensively characterized as constant temperature latent heat thermal energy storage (TES) materials. Nevertheless, the widespread utilization of PCMs is limited due to the flow of liquid PCMs during melting, phase separation, supercooling and low heat transfer rate. In order to overcome these inherent problems and to improve thermo-physical properties, the confinement of PCMs at the nanoscale has been identified as a versatile strategy, which ensures the encapsulation of PCMs in much smaller nano-containers. Such strategies including core–shell, longitudinal, interfacial and porous confinement have been widely presented in recent years to efficiently encapsulate PCMs in nanospaces and are presenting attractive ways to enhance thermal performance. This review summarizes the recent advancement and critical issues of nanoconfinement technologies of PCMs from the point of view of material design. In addition, the potential applications of nanoconfined PCMs in diverse fields, including energy conversion and storage, thermal rectification and temperature controlled drug delivery systems, are presented in detail. Finally, the major drawbacks associated with nanoconfined PCMs and their prospective solutions are also provided.

Broader context
Thermal energy storage technologies play an important role in the growth of the sustainable use of energy in heating and cooling applications including solar energy harvesting, off-peak electricity storage and thermal management of buildings, vehicles, and electrochemical and electronic devices. Latent heat storage using phase change materials (PCMs) is one of the actively pursued technologies, which is cost-effective, operationally simple and has the advantage of high-energy storage density. However, the broad adoption of this technology is limited due to intrinsic problems, including leakage, phase separation, supercooling and low heat transfer rate, associated with PCMs. The confinement of PCMs at the nanoscale is an effective way to overcome these drawbacks as well as to improve the thermophysical properties without affecting the overall energy storage performance. This paper provides a state-of-the-art understanding of various confinement strategies for PCMs and prospective applications in diverse fields. The key insights and trends presented in this review offer a new avenue as to how efficiently PCMs can be confined in the future energy storage infrastructure.

1. Introduction
Fossil fuels are burnt to get energy, which leads to unwanted pollutants in the atmosphere leading to increasing pollution and global warming. Owing to limited resources and the irreversible burning of fossil fuels, the sustainability of fossil fuel based energy is under serious threat.1 To counter the issues of ever-exhausting fossil fuels and increasing pollution and to sustain the life on earth, the scientists are trying to develop new methods of energy production, conversion, and storage.2 Renewable methods of energy conversion and storage have gained tremendous attention in this regard owing to reversible energy generation, green processes and the vast amount of energy reserves. These renewable methods include the use of solar, wind, hydrothermal, geothermal, and other energy sources towards replacing traditional existing fossil fuel based energy.3,4 Approximately 20% of today's energy comes from efficient utilization of these renewable methods of energy conversions and storage.5 Among various methods of energy storage, thermal energy storage (TES) technologies have received great attention for their critical role in a renewable energy storage infrastructure. The latent heat TES based on phase change materials (PCMs) is one of the efficient technologies being actively pursued owing to high storage density in a small temperature region.6
PCMs are functional materials that allow reversible latent heat storage and release from melting and freezing processes.7 In the past few years, PCMs have been extensively used in the fields of electronics thermal management, solar-thermal energy storage, industrial waste heat recovery and off peak electricity storage systems.8–11 Based on the chemical composition, PCMs are divided into inorganic and organic materials. The inorganic PCMs show high volumetric energy storage density, flame retardancy and relatively high thermal conductivity.12 However, large-scale applications of inorganic PCMs are limited by supercooling and phase separation, which limit the instant release and timely utilization of energy.13 The organic PCMs on the other hand do not suffer from phase separation and supercoolingphenomena. However, their thermal conductivity is low, which causes a large temperature gradient and insensitivity to temperature changes.14 Moreover, flammability, volume expansion and leakage during the phase transition are also severe problems associated with organic PCMs.15–17 In the past, a number of efforts have been made to overcome the aforementioned challenges associated with both types of PCMs. For instance, various traditional approaches such as the addition of extra water, nucleating agents, and thickeners and agitation of the salt solution have been utilized to overcome the predicaments of inorganic PCMs in their repeated dissolution and crystallization processes.18 On the other hand, the addition of conductive fillers and flame-retardants has mitigated the drawbacks of organic PCMs. However, these efforts would inevitably reduce the energy storage density of PCMs due to the presence of inactive mass.19–21
Very recently, nanoconfinement technologies have attracted a lot of attention and offer a new avenue for significant improvement in the thermo-physical properties of PCMs while maintaining their energy storage capacity.22–25 Nanoconfinement presents several advantages such as small domain size, large surface area, diverse surface functionalities, controlled volume expansion, reduced reactivity with the external environment and high heat transfer rate. Nonetheless, an informative study to provide a deep understanding of confinement technologies is still missing in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, only one progress report has been published on nanoencapsulation of PCMs but that report mainly addresses one type of confinement method (core–shell encapsulation).22 In this article, a comprehensive review is delivered to outline the recent progress in confinement of PCMs at the nanoscale, major challenges associated with confinement technologies and potential applications of nanoconfined PCMs.
2. Confinement strategies for PCMs
Confinement is the process of enclosing liquid or solid PCMs within supporting materials to fabricate a kind of composite PCM. The primary purpose of confinement is to prevent the problematic contact of the liquid phase of PCMs with the surrounding environment.15 The surface chemistry involved at the interface has a significant impact on the thermodynamical properties. Therefore, confinement technology can be employed to control the phase change parameters by providing a new mechanistic way through heterogeneous nucleation, large contact area and associated surface energy under a confined environment.26 Thus, confinement is not only advantageous to mitigate the drawbacks of PCMs but also improves the thermo-physical properties. For instance, the confinement of salt hydrates within packaging materials not only prevents the loss of water of crystallization during the phase transition to solve the phase separation and supercooling phenomena but also improves the heat transfer rate. Depending on the size, confinement methods can be divided into macro-confinement, micro-confinement and nano-confinement. With the development and deep understanding of nanotechnology, it is well understood that adhesion forces, van der Waals interactions, capillary actions and surface chemistries are more effective at the nanoscale; therefore, nanoconfinement technology has proven to be much more efficient than macro and micro-confinement.22,27 In addition, nanoconfinement offers more efficient heat transfer, as well as accommodates dimensional changes associated with the phase transition of PCMs. According to material designs and dimensions, confinement strategies can be categorized into (i) core–shell (0D), (ii) longitudinal (1D), (iii) interfacial (2D) and (iv) porous (3D) confinement. In core–shell confinement, a small droplet or particle of liquid or solid PCMs is enveloped with shell material. Longitudinal confinement is also a kind of core–shell confinement but in one dimension. Based on shell materials, longitudinal confinement of PCMs can be achieved either by infiltrating the PCM melt into the inner cavity of CNTs (tubular confinement) or by confining PCMs within the internal diameter of core–shell nanofibers (fibrous confinement) using the coaxial electrospinning technique. Interfacial or layer confinement technology concerns the confinement of PCMs at the interface of nanomaterials by the interaction between PCM molecules and the surface of nano-materials such as graphene oxide. In nanoporous confinement, the PCMs are impregnated into the nanopores of the supporting materials through a vacuum induced infiltration process (Fig. 1). Considering size, the term core–shell nanoconfinement is used if the size of the capsules ranges between 1 and 1000 nm and for longitudinal confinement, the diameter of CNTs or fibers should range between 1 and 1000 nm. In interfacial and porous confinement, the term nanoconfinement is used if the size of the interface material and the pore diameter of the supporting materials range between 1 and 1000 nm, respectively. In the following sections, we will elaborate on the aforementioned confinement strategies in detail.
 Fig. 1  Structure of the review. Highlighting the confinement strategies and potential applications of PCMs. 
2.1. Core–shell confinement
Core–shell confinement is the coating of PCMs with supporting materials at the nanoscale. The confined material is known as the core, the coating material is known as the shell and the obtained product is referred to as nanocapsules (NCs). In core–shell confinement of PCMs, the core is always PCMs and the shell could be any supporting material. The NCs may have a simple core–shell, multi-shell and polynuclear architecture depending on the synthetic conditions (Fig. 2). The shell materials should provide structural integrity and stability. In other words, the mechanically strong and thermally conductive coating materials not only encapsulate the PCMs but also improve the heat transfer rate. The proportion between the PCM core and shell material is an important parameter to determine the energy storage performance and structural stability of the composite system. A relatively high weight percentage of the PCM core leads to higher heat storage performance but poor structural stability and vice versa.34–37 Thus the mass loading of PCMs needs to be optimized with respect to the mechanical strength of the coating materials. Numerous coating materials including organic polymers, silica, and metal oxides and hydroxides have been adopted.22 The selection of coating materials is based on the compatibility with the PCM core and the adoption of the synthesis method. Generally, polymerization methods are adopted to encapsulate PCMs with organic coatings, whereas the sol–gel method is used for inorganic coatings.16,19,22,28,29

2.1.1. Polymer shell. 
Polymers are traditional coating materials that have been widely used in PCM NC formation technology. Generally, polymers are cheap, lightweight, mechanically stable, easy to process and compatible with all kinds of PCMs. Additionally, being flexible in nature, polymer coatings accommodate the volume expansion of the PCM core during melting and allow melting with ease, keeping the shape stability of the NCs. These properties of polymers make them promising for being used as shell materials in NC formation.28 Until now, polystyrene, polyacrylates, polyuria, polyurethane, formaldehyde resins and block copolymers have been successfully utilized as shell materials to encapsulate organic PCMs (Table 1). The polymerization techniques including emulsion, interfacial and in situ polymerization are usually adopted for polymer shell formation.29–33

Emulsion polymerization. 
In the process of preparing NCs through the emulsion polymerization method, the insoluble monomer is dispersed uniformly in the continuous phase under the influence of a surfactant, an emulsifier and mechanical stirring. Then the polymeric shell is grown on the surface of the PCM core via three possible mechanistic ways, (1) propagation of the monomer by the addition of free radicals penetrating the monomer-swollen emulsifier micelle, (2) precipitation of the free radical chain length, and (3) free radical growth in the medium inducing propagation after penetrating the monomer droplets that contain the PCM. The emulsion polymerization method is generally suitable for preparation of NCs using liquid PCMs as a core. So far, the emulsion polymerization method has been utilized to encapsulate alkane based PCMs with a poly(methyl methacrylate) or polystyrene shell. In comparison to emulsion polymerization, miniemulsion reaction is propagated within a small droplet, which requires less energy input. Therefore, this technique can be utilized under ambient reaction conditions which are mandatory for the fabrication of stable NCs. This method is feasible for the encapsulation of alkanes as the PCM core with a polyurea, poly(methyl methacrylate), polystyrene, styrene–butyl acrylate (SBA), and styrene–methylmethacrylate copolymer shell. The miniemulsion reaction is further divided into direct emulsion (oil in water emulsion, O/W), indirect emulsion (water in oil emulsion, W/O) and Pickering inverse emulsion. In indirect and direct emulsion, classical emulsifiers such as amphiphilic oligo(methacrylic acid 41-b-methyl methacrylate 8), sodium lauryl sulfate, Tween 80, Span 20 and Span 85 are employed. On the other hand, in Pickering inverse emulsion, solid particles are employed as an emulsifier.21,34–36
Cortazar et al.37 utilized the miniemulsion polymerization method to encapsulate paraffin wax with methyl methacrylate. The maximum amount of encapsulated wax achieved was 60 wt%, presenting an energy storage capacity of 140.3 J g−1, and the capsule size was about 439.4 nm. Moreover, the authors revealed that the NCs having a higher weight percentage of wax suffer from the phase separation phenomenon. Chen et al.38 also used polymethyl methacrylate as a shell material to encapsulate n-dodecanol PCM by using DNS-86 as a polymerizable emulsifier and hexadecane as a co-emulsifier. The nanocapsules fabricated by this method are 100 to 200 nm in diameter and present a latent heat up to 98.8 J g−1. The authors further investigated the effect of the amount of emulsifier and co-emulsifier on latent heat, diameter, size distribution and encapsulation efficiency. Zhang and co-authors coated the core of n-octadecane PCM with polyethyl methacrylate and polymethyl methacrylate with a shell thickness of about 50 nm, a particle size of about 140 nm and 119 nm, respectively, and a core/shell ratio of about 80/20. The authors reduced the degree of supercooling significantly and found that the polyethyl methacrylate shell has relatively better thermal performance.39 Wang et al.40 adopted the low energy Pickering emulsion process to fabricate NCs of nonadecane PCM with a polystyrene shell by using surface-modified amphiphilic zirconium phosphate platelets as an emulsifier at the industrial level. The core–shell NCs of hexadecanol with a crosslinked polymer shell by using the emulsion polymerization method have also been fabricated.41 The as-prepared nanosized core–shell capsules present a high phase change enthalpy of 124.85 J g−1 and good thermal and mechanical stability. Apart from that, the amphiphilic polyurethane was utilized to prepare nanocapsules of paraffin and methyl stearate via emulsion polymerization without adding any emulsifier or dispersant. The authors enhanced the thermal stability and mechanical strength of the polymeric shell by crosslinking the unsaturated bonds of the polyurethane backbone with tripropylene glycol diacrylate.42 In conclusion, miniemulsion is the most adopted polymerization technique in NC coating technology.
Interfacial polymerization. 
In the interfacial polymerization method, the PCM core is first emulsified in O/W or W/O emulsion with the use of an emulsifier and a stabilizing agent. Then the monomer is added to the reaction mixture to form polymeric shell materials at the interface. Finally, the prepared NCs are separated from either the water phase or the oil phase. This technique is suitable to prepare NCs of opposite polarity materials like oil-soluble cores and water-soluble shells. For instance, the NCs of paraffin wax as a core and polyurea as a shell material were fabricated via interfacial polycondensation between tolylene diisocyanate and ethylene diamine. Further, Fe3O4 nanoparticles were selectively impregnated in the core as well as in the shell owing to the unique nature of the polymerization reaction at the interface.43 Generally, the interfacial polymerization technique produces particles of bigger size, and hence it is less utilized in NC coating technology. Nevertheless, it can be used to incorporate conductive fillers in the NC structure to make them responsive to the external environment.

In situ polymerization. 
In this method, first, the emulsion of PCM is prepared in water and then the pre-polymer is added into the continuous phase to encapsulate the PCM core within a solid shell through polymerization reaction. The in situ polymerization technique is very similar to interfacial polymerization but the only difference is that no reactant is added to the core material, and the reaction monomer and the catalyst are located at the surface of the core droplets. This method is used to encapsulate PCMs with polystyrene, formaldehyde resin and poly(methyl methacrylate) based shell materials. Fang et al.44 encapsulated an n-octadecane core with a polystyrene shell by using the ultrasonic assisted in situ polymerization method. The shape of the reported NCs is spherical, ranging from 100 nm to 123 nm in diameter. The same authors also encapsulated n-tetradecane having a lower phase transition temperature with a polystyrene shell for cold energy storage and achieved an encapsulation efficiency up to 89%.45 Fang and co-authors added 1–3% NaCl during polymerization of urea-formaldehyde resin, which consequently stabilized the pre-polymer and enhanced the thermal stability of the prepared NCs.46 In order to investigate the performance of different resins as shell materials, the authors used urea, melamine and urea melamine hybrid formaldehyde resins to prepare the NCs of n-caprylic acid. It was found that the urea-formaldehyde resin is the best shell material among others in terms of NC stability.47 Wu et al.48 added NCs of n-octadecane@polystyrene in water to improve the heat transfer performance of spray cooling and jet impingement. A PCM slurry with a 28% volume fraction of NCs enhanced the heat transfer coefficient by 70% and 50% for spray cooling and jet impingement, respectively.
In conclusion, the encapsulation of organic PCMs with a polymer shell does not involve complications and can be achieved using simple polymerization techniques. On the other hand, salt hydrates are hydrophilic in nature and have the ability to alter their water content; therefore encapsulation of inorganic PCMs is expensive and limited to only inverse emulsion and addition polymerization reactions. In addition to that, the encapsulation efficiency and structural stability of NCs can be controlled by monitoring the molecular weight of the polymers during shell formation. The lower molecular weight shell materials provide better encapsulation efficiency owing to the higher mobility of the small molecules, but reduce the shell's strength.64 Therefore the polymerization technique and reactants are carefully chosen to obtain the desired results. Generally, free radical polymerization reactions lead to the formation of higher molecular weight shells and thus higher mechanical strength and lower encapsulation efficiency. On the other hand, condensation polymerization reactions are limited to the formation of lower molecular weight shells and vice versa.


2.1.2. Inorganic shell materials. 
Despite the operational simplicity of polymers in coating technology, their widespread utilization is still restricted due to some key issues including poor thermal response, flammability and lack of rigidity. In order to overcome the drawback of conventional polymeric shell materials, inorganic materials including silica (SiO2), alumina (Al2O3), titania (TiO2), etc. have been utilized to encapsulate PCMs. Inorganic shell materials exhibit higher thermal conductivity, durability, thermal stability, flame retardancy and mechanical strength in comparison to polymeric shell materials. Therefore, employing inorganic materials for coating of PCMs has been getting more attention recently. Among all, SiO2 is the most widely studied shell material due to some unique properties such as high melting point and low thermal expansion coefficient compared to metal oxides. Generally, to prepare SiO2 based phase change NCs, tetraethyl silicate (Si(OC2H5)4) is the most widely used SiO2 precursor and sol–gel is the most adopted synthetic technique.55,57,60
Sol–gel. 
The sol–gel method is a well-known physico-chemical method to prepare NCs with an inorganic shell. It has gained more attention in recent years as it is cheap and requires mild processing conditions. The term “sol–gel” refers to solution-gelling and the main process consists of three steps: (1) hydrolysis, (2) condensation and (3) drying. In the first step of hydrolysis, metal alkoxide M(OR)n is uniformly mixed with solvent, complexing agent and catalyst to form a homogeneous dispersion. Through the reaction of hydrolysis, the alkoxide group (OR) is substituted with the hydroxyl group (OH) from the water molecule and metal hydroxide (OR)n−1–M–OH through nucleophilic substitution reaction, releasing R–OH as a side product. In the second step, the condensation reaction between OH groups leads to M–O–M bonds and forms an interconnected 3D network by producing water as the condensation product. Similarly, the reaction between OH and OR leads to M–O–M by releasing R–OH as a by-product. At this stage, the state of dispersion changes from solution to gel; that is why this method is known as the sol–gel method. The prepared NCs are obtained by drying, sintering and curing in the final step. In addition, the sol–gel method is combined with the miniemulsion polymerization method to obtain better results. For example, Zhu et al.53 encapsulated n-octadecane with an organosilica shell via interfacial co-hydrolysis polycondensation of SiO2 precursors using the miniemulsion method. Later, the effect of emulsion concentration on the morphology (capsule shell thickness) of phase change NCs was also investigated.65 The authors found that by decreasing the water to ethanol ratio, increasing the CTAB concentration, or increasing the NH3–H2O content, the morphology of NCs is regulated from thin-shelled nanobowls to thick-shelled matrix type particles in which PCM is embedded inside the pores of the SiO2 matrix. In mesoporous particles, the pronounced interfacial contact of encapsulated PCM with the solid support provides more nucleation sites compared to core–shell particles and thus reduced supercooling. Therefore, owing to mesoporous confinement and heterogeneous nucleation sites, a thick shell is more promising to reduce supercooling than a thin shell.
Taking into account the rigidity of shell materials, some authors blazed a trail for enhancing the energy storage performance of hybrid systems. Zhang et al.59 encapsulated stearic acid with a SiO2 nanoshell with controlled shell thickness and enhanced the energy storage capacity of encapsulated PCM 36.9% more than that of unconfined stearic acid (Fig. 3A–C). This enhancement of latent heat is attributed to the formation of a multiple stable hydrogen bonds network under high-superimposed stress on the encapsulated stearic acid core from the SiO2 shell, which significantly compresses the intermolecular spacing of the stearic acid core as compared to its unconfined state. Therefore, breaking and reforming of these closely packed, stable hydrogen bonds contributes to the latent heat of stearic acid when it undergoes phase transition. This strong hydrogen bonding also leads to a rise in the phase transition temperature of confined stearic acid (Fig. 3D). In spite of the advantages of a rigid shell, some drawbacks have also been reported in the literature. Rao et al.66 explored the use of molecular dynamics methods to study the melting behavior of confined n-octadecane in a free and a constrained SiO2 shell. They found that the mobility of encapsulated octadecane, the interaction between octadecane molecules and the elongation strength of individual molecular chains are restrained by the rigid SiO2 shell. In contrast, the soft shell does not restrict the movement of encapsulated core molecules. The flexible shell can increase the fluidity and ultimately enhance the heat transfer rate of the hybrid system.

Other than organic based PCMs, inorganic PCMs have also been confined within the SiO2 shell. Zhang et al.62 synthesized Na2SO4·10H2O encapsulated SiO2 nanobowls via synchronous hydrolysis reactions of SiO2 precursors. The authors proposed and then validated that the microstress inside the liquid droplets is responsible for the formation of solid nanostructures. The overall formation of bowl like morphology involves four stages including nucleation of SiO2, growth of oblate spheres, growth of brims and the formation of solid nanobowls. At the beginning, nucleation of SiO2 takes place by the hydrolysis and subsequent condensation of the SiO2 precursor during the sol–gel process. In the second step, the co-precipitation of SiO2 and Na2SO4·10H2O within droplet micro-reactors leads to the formation of Na2SO4·10H2O@SiO2 oblates followed by the growth of brims in a whirlpool-like aqueous phase system. Finally, brims grow to form Na2SO4·10H2O@SiO2 solid nanobowls. To validate the proposed mechanism, morphological changes were monitored by TEM at different stages of the reaction (Fig. 4A). In the as-prepared composite system, mesoporous confinement of Na2SO4·10H2O within the SiO2 wall mitigates the phase segregation and consequently enhances the energy storage capacity (Fig. 4B). Moreover, the SiO2 wall, acting as a heterogeneous nucleator, suppresses the degree of supercooling to some extent but it is still huge and not suitable for real life applications.

Besides organic and inorganic PCMs, metallic PCMs including indium, tin and alloys have also been encapsulated by a SiO2 shell.67,68 Metal-based PCMs exhibit high crystallinity and thermal conductivity. The silica shell can further mitigate the corrosion and prevent leakage. Lai et al.10 encapsulated pre-synthesized Sn nanoparticles in a SiOx shell (Sn/SiOx) using 3-aminopropyl trimethoxysilane (APTMS) as a SiOx precursor in a simple three-step process. The prepared NCs were embedded into eutectic salt to enhance solar-thermal energy storage in solar-thermal power plants. Wu and coworkers69 suspended bare indium and SiO2 encapsulated indium nanoparticles in a base liquid, poly-α-olefin, for high-temperature heat transfer applications. In contrast to expectations, they found that the coalescence of indium particles within a single-phase fluid is not a big issue. Therefore, indium nanoparticles can be used without encapsulation. Other than SiO2, scientists also explore the possibility of using metal compound-based materials as the shell. Metal compound-based shell materials possess high thermal conductivity, high mechanical strength, and a compact and rigid structure as compared to SiO2. The formation of a metal compound shell involves the condensation of a metal hydroxide precursor during in situ sol–gel and emulsion polymerization, similar to SiO2 shell formation. Until now, very few metal compounds have been adopted to encapsulate PCMs.70–72 Latibari et al.57 utilized TiO2 to prepare NCs of stearic acid and found that the NCs present higher thermal conductivity and encapsulation efficiency up to 64.76%. Using the boehmite (γ-AlOOH) shell to encapsulate stearic acid and palmitic acid (Fig. 5A–C), it has been discovered that the phase transition temperature of stearic acid and palmitic acid is lowered by 50 °C due to the confinement effect (Fig. 5D).58,61 The heat storage density of the prepared NCs was about 140 J g−1, which is lower than that of the pristine PCM but still higher than that of the mostly room temperature PCMs. Therefore, boehmite coating technology can be utilized to alter the phase transition temperature of high-temperature PCMs having high-energy storage performance to room temperature.

In order to fabricate multi-shell NCs, Wu et al.63 designed V(OH)2NH2 as a solid template and prepared lepidocrocite type VOOH single and multi-shelled hollow spheres by modulating the reaction temperature (Fig. 6A–C). Then, the vacuum-ultrasonication based impregnation method was adopted to infiltrate CaCl2·6H2O. Experimental results demonstrate that the confinement of salt hydrates within multi-shell hollow spheres improves cyclic energy storage performance as compared to single-shell NCs and bare PCM without affecting the phase transition behavior (Fig. 6D and E). This improved cyclic energy storage performance originates from the extra protection of water of crystallization using a double shell. The authors also stated that the distributed confined space in multi-shelled VOOH nanospheres might play an important role in overcoming the phase separation and supercooling.

In conclusion, core–shell confinement technology offers a variety of coating methods and the selection of each method is based on (1) the parameters of phase change NCs, such as capsule size, size distribution, degree of dispersion, and the environment of use and (2) the selection of shell materials – each shell material has its own advantages and drawbacks. The inorganic coating offers high structural stability and heat transfer rate while polymer encapsulation is easy to process. In addition, the structural rigidity of inorganic shells can be used to alter the phase transition properties. Moreover, NC coating technology is useful to overcome problems such as phase separation and supercooling in the field of PCMs. Currently, nanoencapsulated PCMs are being used in coolant slurries, thermo-regulated textiles and drug delivery related applications. Despite the recent advancements, relatively low dimensions and less mass production still hinder the utilization of this technology for building and many other applications.

2.2. Longitudinal confinement
In longitudinal confinement, one dimension of the material ranges from μm to cm scale, and thus offers high continuity in confined systems, which is advantageous in both practical and fundamental aspects. For instance, PCM contained nanofibers can directly be spinned to fabricate thermo-regulated textiles while core–shell nanoparticles always need a holding support. From the fundamental research point of view, the high degree of alignment of PCM molecules along the longitudinal direction at the nanoscale may enhance the energy storage performance of 1D confined systems. There are two methods to achieve longitudinal confinement of PCMs, (1) confining the PCM within the diameter of nanofibers (fibrous confinement) and (2) confining the PCM in the inner cavities of nanotubes (tubular confinement). In this section, we discuss both confinement methods one by one.

2.2.1. Fibrous confinement. 
In the last decade, electrospinning has been widely accepted as a fascinating technique for fabricating nanofibers with larger surface area, controlled size and morphology. The fabrication process involves the use of a strong electrostatic field to pull a viscous droplet of the polymers into an elongated jet. Dynamic distortion results in stretching and whipping which is responsible for the attenuation of the jet into a long fiber with ultrathin diameter (Fig. 7A). Materials scientists have successfully fabricated phase change nanofibers by the electrospinning technique.73–76 Based on the fiber architecture, two main methods including single-phase electrospinning and coaxial electrospinning have been utilized to confine PCMs. Single-phase electrospinning involves the spinning of a mixture containing PCM and the supporting polymer to form PCM blended polymer nanofibers.77 On the other hand, coaxial electrospinning is utilized to fabricate core–sheath nanofibers with PCMs as the core and polymers as supporting sheath materials. Similarly, the melt coaxial electrospinning method combines melt electrospinning with a coaxial spinneret, allowing PCMs to be electrospun and confined in one-step (Fig. 7A).75,78 So far, different researchers have tried to fabricate composite type PCM nanofibers by using a mixed solution of either melted PCM or core–shell encapsulated PCM with supporting material. In the former case, the prepared nanofibers are just a blend of PCM and the supporting polymer matrix. In the latter case, the fabrication of fibers by means of PCM nanocapsules utilizes dual encapsulation that ultimately decreases the overall mass content and energy storage capacity of the hybrid system.79 The composite nanofibers prepared by the electrospinning of an NC dispersion were limited to storing only 4.3 J g−1 latent heat with 15 weight percent of PCM nanocapsules.80 However, direct 1D core–sheath confinement is promising, due to higher weight loading of PCMs and consequently higher energy storage capacity compared to other aforementioned architectures. To achieve this, for the first time in 2006, Xia's group used a melt coaxial spinneret to prepare core–sheath nanofibers using hexadecane and octadecane as a core and the TiO2–PVP composite as a sheath material. The weight percentage of the core as well as the sheath material was modulated by optimizing the flow rate of the prospective solution. The TEM images depict that the PCMs break up into spherical droplets along the length in the interior of the nanofiber structure due to the low viscosity of the core materials (Fig. 7B). The energy storage density of the core–sheath nanofibers was found to be 71 J g−1 with 31% by weight of hexadecane and 114 J g−1 with 45% octadecane by weight loading.25 In addition, PEG and cellulose acetate core–sheath nanofibers have also been prepared by the coaxial electrospinning method. Instead of distributed droplets in the core of the fibers prepared by Xia's group, Chen et al.81 encapsulated a continuous PEG core architecture within the fiber diameter (Fig. 7C). The formation of a continuous core is attributed to the higher viscosity of PEG compared to alkane based PCMs. However, the aforementioned phase change fibers contained one kind of PCM that displayed only one phase transition point. Sometimes, it is demanding to fabricate multicomponent phase change fibers containing different phase transition temperature for broader temperature window applications. In order to attempt this, Wang and coworkers82 fabricated multicomponent phase change fibers through the one-step multi-fluidic compound-jet electrospinning technique in a temperature-controlled chamber. Different kinds of encapsulated PCMs exhibit their own thermal properties independently (Fig. 7D). Furthermore, new materials can replace the independently encapsulated components to make multifunctional intelligent materials. In order to investigate the impact of a confined environment, Luo et al.83 studied the dimension dependent confined crystallization behavior of PEG encapsulated with cellulose acetate. The WAXD patterns of unconfined and confined PEG are presented in Fig. 7E. Interestingly, the authors found only one broad peak around 19.3° instead of two peaks when the confinement dimension is smaller than 120 nm in diameter. This abnormal crystal structure depicts that the crystallization is restricted by the confined environment.

2.2.2. Tubular confinement. 
CNTs being hollow cylindrical structures, PCMs can be infiltrated into the inner space of open-ended CNTs. The overall infiltration process involves three steps. In the first step, air from the inner space of CNTs is removed under vacuum and then intercalation is proceeded by self-sustained diffusion using a dilute solution of PCM at higher pressure (Fig. 8A). In the last step, filtration and removal of PCM from the outer surface of CNTs is carried out by treating with hot solvent. PCMs having a higher Brownian motion and lower surface tension (>200 mN m−1) are capable of self-diffusion inside CNTs. In addition to encapsulation, the sp2 hybridized conductive wall of CNTs is advantageous to enhance the thermal conductivity. Therefore, the intercalation of PCMs inside CNTs provides a simultaneous solution to leakage and to poor thermal response.84,85 Bazilevsky et al.86 devised a room temperature, open-air method to selectively impregnate PEG from a dilute, volatile solution into the interior channel of pre-wetted CNTs of 50–100 nm diameter (Fig. 8B). On investigating the effect of the molecular weight of PEG on the diffusion rate, the authors found that the radii of gyration of macromolecules play an important role in the filling process. For instance, macromolecules with radii of gyration less than the inner radii of CNTs can be diffused inside. Macromolecules having radii larger than the inner radii of CNTs face difficulties in penetrating inside CNT cavities and remain outside or are deposited near the ends of CNTs. It is found that in the case of CNTs having a diameter of 50–100 nm, the optimal molecular weight of PEG is 600 kDa for better diffusion. Scientists have also investigated the intercalation of alkane based PCMs. Sinha-Ray infiltrated two types of paraffin and their mixtures with triglycerides inside CNTs. The overall weight loading percentage of PCMs was less than 20%. The authors found that the melting temperature of confined PCMs was reduced in comparison to the bulk PCM. The working temperature window for confined PCMs was also extended (36 °C) with reduced response time. In order to synthesize highly pure and crystalline CNTs, Jeong and coworkers87 first fabricated a CNT-encapsulated In–Sn alloy nanowire catalyst. Then the encapsulated alloy was removed by heat treatment at a lower temperature (1800 °C) at 1 Pa pressure. Furthermore, the use of hydrogen gas reduced the metal oxides to their respective metals during the heat treatment, resulting in the complete removal of catalysts and other impurities. Then the intercalation of paraffin wax up to 40 wt% was proceeded by vacuum infiltration. The authors monitored the infiltration process by in situ TEM operation. Their findings clearly depict that, below the melting temperature of paraffin wax, the inner cavity of CNTs seemed to be completely empty. However, at a higher temperature, the molten wax instantaneously intercalated into the hollow channel of the CNT. The filling of paraffin into the CNT proceeded as the reaction time was increased (Fig. 8C). In order to figure out the filling mechanism of PCMs inside CNTs, the orientation of confined PCM molecules, and the interaction between CNTs and PCM molecules at the molecular scale, Nie et al.88 performed MD simulations to verify their experimental results. The theoretical results revealed that the confined paraffin molecules are more orderly arranged inside the CNTs than those in freestanding paraffin due to the confinement effect. The orientation of confined paraffin molecules is along the CNT inner wall, instead of occupying the central position inside the CNT channel, and the structural distribution is more regular near the inner wall of the CNTs. The average distance between the CNT wall and paraffin molecules remained around 3.8 A, which results in van der Waals interactions between the paraffin molecules and the CNT wall. Furthermore, the orderly confined structural distribution turned to disorder on increasing the temperature above the melting point of paraffin due to the thermal motion of confined molecules and associated with the solid–liquid phase transition of paraffin. In summary, tubular confinement technology is still in the development phase. Several key factors such as optimization of the CNT diameter considering the ease of infiltration and leakage problems and the relation between surface energy and diffusivity constant need to be addressed.

2.3. Interfacial confinement
Interfacial or layer confinement technology limits the fluidity of melted PCMs due to the interaction between the PCM molecules and the surface of nanomaterials such as graphene oxide (GO)89–91 and functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs).92–95 However, owing to the larger surface area and high functionalization degree, GO performs better than functionalized CNTs. When comparing interfacial confinement technology with porous confinement, the former deals with comparatively strong hydrogen bonding and grafting of PCM molecular chains onto GO sheets whereas the latter keeps liquid PCMs packed inside the pores by capillary action. To realize either hydrogen bonding or grafting, three common methods including reductive functionalization induced self-assembly, filtration induced self-assembly and blending are used. Hydrogen bonding induced confinement technology is only limited to PCMs that contain oxygen and hydrogen comprising functional groups such as alcohols,90 fatty acids96 and rarely salt hydrates.97 Reductive induced self-assembly deals with the reduction and then desirable functionalization of GO sheets. In order to confine fatty acid based PCMs within GO sheets, GO sheets were first reduced and functionalized with oleylamine to anchor palmitic acid and then self-assembled into a 3D structure (Fig. 9A). In comparison to porous confinement in which a 3D porous macrostructure is first fabricated by self-assembly and freeze-drying and then PCM is filled by a melt-infiltration process, in situ adsorption of PCM eliminates the common freeze-drying and melt-infiltration efforts.96

Addressing the second method, Zhang and coworkers in situ synthesized GO composite paper by intercalating PEG into the interior skeleton of GO sheets through hydrogen bonding between PEG molecular chains and GO sheets.89 The fabrication of the composite paper simply involved the self-assembly of the residue after co-filtration of an aqueous dispersion containing PEG and GO of various concentrations. Prior to filtration, the GO and PEG dispersion was stirred for a long time to fully anchor or adsorb the PEG molecules on the surface of the GO sheets. During the filtration of dispersion, free PEG molecules initially pass through the filter membrane. Then the deposition of GO sheets forms a thin film on the membrane surface quickly restricting the filtration process (Fig. 9B). This newly developed thin film limits the further loss of PEG molecules, resulting in layer-wise deposition of both GO sheets and PEG molecules on top of each other within the composite structure as the thickness of the film increases. The solvent molecules slowly diffuse through the growing layered composite structure, while PEG remains interlocked. These interlocked PEG molecules play a dual role from a structural point of view. Reversible solid–liquid phase transition can satisfy the heat energy storage requirement and crosslinking of GO sheets through hydrogen bonding can avoid the sliding of negatively charged sheets. The as-prepared GO paper exhibits a high mechanical strength of about 19.2 MPa and flexibility. For energy storage, it shows excellent cyclic phase transition and shape stabilization without any leakage due to the strong interfacial confinement effect. Moreover, the authors found a depression in the freezing point of intercalated PEG compared to bulk PEG by decreasing the GO layer spacing without disturbing the melting temperature. This unusual supercooling behavior is not favorable for the usual heat storage systems; however, it may be useful for some controlled heat release applications.
The third approach is to blend GO sheets with PCMs, to realize either hydrogen bonding or grafting of PCM molecular chains onto GO sheets by chemical reaction. Different scholars have been attempting to fabricate composites of GO with PEG by the blending method and have grafted PEG molecular chains onto GO sheets.99–101 Each interaction has its own advantages and drawbacks. In grafting, PCM molecular chains are connected to GO sheets by strong chemical bonding that leads to a more highly stable composite structure than the hydrogen-bonded counterpart. Nevertheless, the motion of grafted chains is restricted due to the strong confinement, which ultimately reduces the energy storage performance compared to the hydrogen-bonded structure.102 The phase transition temperature of confined PCMs is reduced in both cases due to the interaction between GO sheets and PCM molecules.103 Wang and coworkers fabricated the composites of PEG with GO rGO and –COOH functionalized GO and studied the impact of interactions on the melting temperature of PEG. They found that the depression in melting point is more significant in composites of –COOH functionalized GO due to the stable hydrogen bond formation.104 Moreover, the achievement of a high loading percentage of PCM by grafting technology is also limited. To address this issue, in a recent publication, Cao et al. grafted polyhexadecyl acrylate (PHDA) with GO sheets by in situ free radical polymerization and then the PHDA grafted GO sheets were blended with PHDA in order to prepare a form-stable composite (Fig. 9C). In the final composite, grafted PHDA behaves as a solid-to-solid PCM and free PHDA undergoes solid–liquid phase transition and remains entrapped by weak interactions. As a result, PHDA grafted GO sheets work as an energy storage component in addition to their role as a free counterpart as well as a supporting material to keep the shape stable.98
The interfacial confinement technology was originally designed to effectively prevent the leakage of the PCMs, but the follow-up studies found that the interaction between the nanomaterial and the PCM interface can effectively reduce the phase transition temperature of some PCMs, which makes PCMs more realistic for controlled heat storage and release applications. However, the compromise between shape stability and energy storage performance limits the widespread application of interface-confined PCMs in TES systems.
2.4. Porous confinement
Nanoporous packing allows PCMs to be confined within the nanopores of supporting matrix materials to achieve a phase change composite system. The impregnation of PCMs inside the pores of the matrix is driven by the vacuum or solvent assisted infiltration process. The capillary action of confined PCMs inside the pores of the matrix can ensure the stability of the phase change composite, effectively prevent leakage during melting and retain form-stablity.105–107 In pore-confined PCMs, the encapsulation efficiency of PCMs is determined by the pore size. Based on the pore diameter, the porous matrices can be divided into three classes: microporous (i.e., <2 nm), mesoporous (i.e., 2–50 nm) and macroporous (i.e., >50 nm). Microporous confinement of PCMs resists the crystallization of PCMs due to the restricted movement of PCM molecular chains inside the small pores. On the other hand, the pores of the macroporous matrix are too large to hold the liquid PCMs by capillary action, so additional encapsulation efforts are needed to prevent leakage. In comparison to micro and macroporous matrices, the mesoporous scaffold has a suitable pore size to adsorb PCMs possessing better thermophysical properties and shape stability.108–113 In addition to the packaging of PCMs, nanoporous matrices can also improve the other properties of composite PCMs, such as sunlight absorption, electrical and thermal conduction, flame retardancy, etc., depending on the nature of the skeleton. So far, several porous matrices including mesoporous silica, 3D porous carbons and metal organic framework based materials have been utilized to achieve pore-confined PCMs. The selection of the porous carrier is totally based on the desired properties of the composite system.

2.4.1. Silica scaffolds. 
Porous silica is an inorganic amorphous material. It has been widely studied as a supporting matrix to impregnate PCMs owing to outstanding properties, such as large surface area, low density, controllable pore structures, high adsorption capacity, stable interconnected inorganic network, fire-resistance, eco-friendly nature and cost-effectiveness. In situ sol–gel and melt infiltration methods have been utilized to prepare form-stable phase change composites of SiO2. The sol–gel method is a one-step process in which PCM is in situ encapsulated during the formation of an interconnected network of SiO2. On the other hand, melt infiltration is a two-step process. In the first step, an interconnected porous network of SiO2 is prepared independently. Then in the second step, PCM is impregnated inside the pores by the vacuum or solvent assisted infiltration method. In this section, we focus on phase change composites of SiO2 prepared by both (in situ sol–gel and melt infiltration) methods one by one.

In situ sol–gel. 
Li et al.114 prepared paraffin/SiO2 composites by the in situ sol–gel method, with more than 75 weight percent loading of paraffin. The authors mitigated the leakage problem of paraffin through porous confinement. In addition to encapsulation, Li and co-authors115 added expanded graphite into the paraffin/SiO2 composite system to enhance the thermal conductivity. Other than paraffin, polyethylene glycol (PEG) possessing longer molecular chains has also been confined within the silica network.116,117 The findings of different researchers depict that the loading mass and the length of PCM molecular chains determine the confinement efficiency. Yang and coworkers studied the impact of PEG-1500 mass content on the latent heat of PEG/SiO2 composites, and found that the crystallization of PEG molecular chains is restricted below 70% mass content due to complete embedding of PEG chains within the SiO2 network, resulting in almost negligible latent heat storage. When the loading percentage of PEG exceeded 70%, some molecular chains are partially embedded and the surface of the porous skeleton produced “active” segments that further associate with outer chains and keep the composite form stable. At higher loading, the number of outer chains increased, making the gel matrix unable to constrain the entire PEG molecule and resulting in leakage of PCM above the melting point.118 In order to improve thermal performance, Li et al.109 added 2.7% graphite in the PEG/SiO2 composite system and increased the thermal conductivity of the composite up to 0.558 W m−1 K−1. Apart from graphite, the addition of 3.45 wt% Cu powder was also found to enhance the thermal conductivity of the PEG/SiO2 composite, which increased to 0.431 W m−1 K−1.119 Considering the flammability of organic PCMs, researchers also attempted to prepare flame retardant phase change composites. Fang et al.120 added the melamine compound to reduce the flammability of palmitic acid composites. The microstructure of the residue of the as-prepared composite after combustion depicts that the homogeneous and compact charred residue reduced the flammability of the phase change composite. Instead of adding new flame retardant compounds, another solution is to modify the supporting materials. In this regard, phosphorus and nitrogen doped silicon as a halogen-free flame retardant supporting matrix has been utilized to adsorb paraffin.121 The study found that, when the temperature reaches 600 °C, the content of residual carbon is 32.4% and the heat release rate is decreased by 62.1%. The charring ability of paraffin is enhanced due to the interaction of paraffin and hybrid silsesquioxane. This mechanism optimizes the firmness and expansibility of the carbon layer and improves the overall thermal stability and flame retardancy of the composite.
Melt infiltration. 
In the in situ sol–gel preparation of phase change composites of SiO2, the microstructure of the composites is not controllable. Therefore, the melt impregnation of PCMs inside the pores of pre-prepared porous structures is thought to be a better approach to solve the leakage problem. Basing on this concept, Zhang and coworkers122 confined polyethylene glycol hexadecyl ether (Brij58) and polyethylene glycol octadecyl ether (Brij76) within the mesopores of MCM-41 by the melt infiltration process. Xiangfa et al.123 confined erythritol into the nanopores of SiO2 aerogel and achieved form-stable phase change composites with improved thermal properties. In the investigation of the impact of the pore size of the gel matrix on the crystallization behavior of PEG, Guo and Wang found that, if the pore size of the silica gel matrix is smaller than 5.4 nm, crystallization of the PEG segment is completely restricted and no significant phase transition is observed. However, the crystallization is allowed by increasing the pore size to greater than 5.4 nm. In other words, the energy storage capacity of PEG is proportional to the pore size of the gel matrix.124
In addition, the surface chemistry of the porous matrix can influence the adsorption and crystallization of PCMs. The surfaces of SiO2 gels without modification possess a large number of hydroxyl groups, which make them able to adsorb hydrophilic PCMs. Sometimes, the environment does not favor hydrophilic PCMs under mist conditions due to their sensitivity to moisture. In that case, hydrophobic phase change composites are practically attractive. In order to enhance the adsorption capacity of hydrophobic PCMs, Huang et al.125 alkylated the surface of hydrophilic SiO2 aerogels to make them hydrophobic for the effective impregnation of hydrophobic PCMs (Fig. 10a and b). The adsorption capacity of PCMs was increased up to 34.7% with improved thermal stability and energy storage capacity. Moreover, the authors carbonized the alkylated surface for harvesting sunlight and enhancing the thermal conductivity of aerogel-based composite PCMs.

Similarly, Wang et.al. engineered the surface of SBA-15 to regulate the interactions between PEG molecular chains and external/internal surfaces of a supporting matrix to study the confined crystallization behavior of PEG. To investigate the effect of interactions, the authors replaced the OH surface functional groups of the HO-SBA-15-OH channel with NH2 and CH3 to prepare NH2-SBA-15-NH2 and NH2-SBA-15-CH3 supporting channels. In the PEG/HO-SBA-15-OH confined system, the crystallization of PEG is restricted due to the strong hydrogen bonding between confined PEG molecular chains and the internal surface of the support. On the other hand, the NH2 groups functionalized on the internal surface of SBA-15 reduced the strength of hydrogen bonding between PEG molecules and the channel surface of SBA-15, which consequently results in alteration in the conformation of the PEG molecular chains from a train structure to a loop structure. These loop-structured chains are capable of stretching and crystallization. Furthermoe, the CH3 groups modified on the external surface of the channel restrict the spillover of PCM molecules from the supports due to the opposite polarities of PEG molecules and methyl groups (Fig. 11).126

In addition to SBA-15, Wang and coauthors127 utilized also other forms of the porous SiO2 matrix including CPG (pore size: 8.1 and 300 nm), KIT-6 (pore size: 8.6 nm) and C-SBA-15 (pore size: 15.6 nm) to study the confined phase change behavior of hexadecane. The authors found that hexadecane shows only the triclinic phase in the pores of CPG (300 nm), whereas in the small pores (7.8–17.2 nm) of other channels, hexadecane behaves different from the bulk one with the existence of new stable and metastable phases due to the contribution of interfacial energy. Similarly, Mitran et al.128 confined lauric acid within hexagonal ordered mesoporous SiO2 molecular sieves, MCM-41 and SBA-41, having pore diameter 2.8 and 6.3 nm respectively, and two disordered mesocellular SiO2 foams having spherical pores 27–34.9 nm in diameter connected by 10.4–14.9 nm windows. The mesocellular SiO2 foam based material with up to 83 wt% PCM has the ability to store 124 J g−1 latent heat, almost 90% efficiency with respect to the PCM mass content, presenting two separate melting–crystallization temperature regimes associated with bulk and nanoconfined phases.
In molecular sieve based mesoporous forms of SiO2, the assembly of silica granules develops the porous structure in which the PCM is trapped inside the pores. Impregnation of PCMs into the pores of mesoporous SiO2 spheres and sheets has also been reported.129–132 Min et al. tailor-made radial mesoporous SiO2 (RMS) spheres through a self-assembly process using the CTAB surfactant as a template and TEOS as a SiO2 source (Fig. 12A). The as-prepared spheres exhibit mesopores with a mean pore diameter of 7.62 nm and some macropores as well (Fig. 12B). The adsorption of PEG into the pores was achieved by the vacuum infiltration process. During the impregnation process, some of the PCM chains inevitably diffused into the pores while the remaining chains adsorbed on the outer surface of the spheres (Fig. 12C). These meso- and nano-pore confined and surface adsorbed PEG chains hamper the crystal aggregation.133 Wang and coworkers134 assembled SiO2 nanoparticles bearing percolated nanosized pores into porous micro-scaled spherical shells and then in situ encapsulated alkane based PCM. This approach enables the entrapment of PCM within and between the particles. Liu et al.135 enhanced the thermal conductivity of the composite system by attaching Ag nanoparticles to Sn2+ activated SiO2 nanosheets. The attachment of 5 nm Ag nanoparticles on the surface of Sn2+ activated SiO2 nanosheets developed a hierarchical porous nanostructure, which was further filled by liquid PEG to prepare a form-stable phase change composite system with 66.1% PCM content.

Conclusively, SiO2 based nanoporous skeletons possess controllable high porosity to adsorb PCMs with good shape stability. In addition to that, the diverse surface chemistries of SiO2 matrices can also be engineered to regulate the confinement of PCMs within porous scaffolds. Being inexpensive, the mass production of SiO2/PCM composites could be used for thermal insulation of buildings in hot weather. Moreover, the encapsulation of PCMs with SiO2 scaffolds is advantageous to overcome the flammability and supercooling to some extent. However, the practical utilization of composite materials in solar-thermal energy storage systems is restricted due to the insulating and poor absorbing nature of SiO2 matrices in comparison to other competitors in this field.


2.4.2. Carbon scaffolds. 
Carbon-based 3D porous materials including porous CNT macrostructures, graphene aerogels, carbon aerogels and expanded graphite have been successfully utilized as the supporting matrix to hold PCMs. The widespread utilization of these matrices is due to some outstanding properties. Compared to metal foams, these materials are cheap, lightweight, stable and compatible with all kinds of PCMs. Carbon-based scaffolds exhibit high internal nanoporosity, while metallic foams possess macropores, which may cause leakage during solid–liquid phase transition. In comparison to SiO2 and other porous matrices, these scaffolds have higher thermal and electrical conductivity, which is advantageous to reduce the charging and discharging time for effective storage and release of thermal energy. Moreover, it is evident from the black appearance of carbon scaffolds that they have the ability to absorb sunlight with good photo-thermal conversion efficiency, which makes them a promising matrix to load PCMs for solar-thermal energy conversion and storage systems.136 Therefore, carbon-based 3D porous and conductive scaffolds are effective to improve shape stability and thermal conductivity and even realize electro/photo to thermal energy conversion and storage.
Graphene aerogel. 
Graphene is a 2D material that is composed of sp2 bonded carbon atoms; it exhibits a large number of fascinating applications due to its outstanding properties. The self-assembly of graphene oxide sheets into a 3D architecture through a reductive hydrothermal process137 or direct growth by the CVD method137 offers a large number of interconnected open pores, which can be filled with liquid PCMs to fabricate a shape stable and conductive composite.138 Zhong and coworkers139 firstly employed graphene aerogel to fabricate a phase change composite of octadecanoic acid in 2013. The authors found that the thermal conductivity of the composite increased up to 2.635 W m−1 K−1 with 20 weight percentage loading of graphene aerogel, which is 14 times higher than that of the pure stearic acid. Moreover, because of the high loading capacity of graphene aerogels for octadecanoic acid, the composite exhibited higher latent heat (181.8 J g−1). Similarly, Zhang et al. infiltrated wax based PCM inside graphene foam, prepared by the reductive self-assembly process (Fig. 13A and B). The prepared composite was used for solar-thermal energy conversion and storage systems. Ye et al.140 modified the hydrothermal process for reductive assembly of graphene oxide sheets to enable in situ encapsulation of paraffin within the closed cell of the graphene network. The in situ prepared composite demonstrated excellent performance, large latent heat of melting and fusion, high thermal conductivity and good shape stability. Similarly, to develop in situ core–shell like morphology, Shang and co-authors used the one spot Pickering emulsion template process to encapsulate hexadecanol within the graphene network.141 Generally, graphene aerogel prepared by the conventional hydrothermal method consists of a randomly interconnected network of graphene sheets. Therefore, the fabricated phase change composites exhibit isotropy. To prepare anisotropic phase change composites, Li et al.142 fabricated structurally, optically, thermally and electrically anisotropic graphene aerogel (AN-GA) by employing gaseous HCl to in situ solidify ordered graphene oxide liquid crystals followed by reduction, supercritical drying and thermal annealing in an inert atmosphere (Fig. 13C and D). The prepared aerogel exhibited high thermal and electrical conductivity, and significant anisotropy in both thermal and electrical conductivity. The composite of the anisotropic graphene aerogel was prepared by infiltrating PCM into the aligned wall structure and confined pores of the aerogel. Moreover, the phase change composite was driven by small voltage and sunlight.

In general, graphene aerogel possessing low density and high porosity is advantageous to uptake a high mass percentage of PCMs. Nonetheless, a highly dense and interconnected microstructure is useful to fabricate conductive composites. To attempt this, Yang et al. fabricated high-density hybrid graphene aerogel by reducing and self-assembling a mixture of graphene oxide and graphene nanoparticles followed by open air-drying. The authors also explained the mechanism of hybrid aerogel formation. According to them, graphene oxide sheets develop an interconnected network to hold graphene nanoparticles, while the graphene nanoparticles act as a rigid support to avoid excessive volume shrinkage of the 3D network during the air-drying process. The density and thermal conductivity of the as-prepared aerogel were modulated by varying the mass percentage of graphene nanoparticles to graphene sheets. The composite of octadecanol with 12 wt% graphene exhibited a thermal conductivity of 5.92 W m−1 K−1, which is 26 times higher than that of pure octadecanol, while maintaining 202.8 J g−1 enthalpy of fusion.144 Instead of using the hydrothermal method to prepare graphene aerogel, Qi and coworkers first prepared graphene foam by using the CVD method and then filled the pores of graphene foam with hollow graphene. The phase change composite was prepared by impregnation of PCM into the hierarchical porous matrix through the vacuum infiltration later. The thermal conductivity of the phase change composite is 744% and 87% higher than that of pure PCM and the composite of PCM with graphene foam without the graphene network, respectively.145 Similarly, to enhance the thermal conductivity of porous scaffolds, Yang et al.146 fabricated an interconnected 3D porous network of graphene oxide as a supporting material and boron nitride as a conductive filler through an ice-templated assembly method. The authors found that the crystalline state of ice inside the network during the freezing process determines the porosity of the scaffold. The porous microstructure and the thermal conductivity of the scaffold were modulated by varying the freezing temperature during casting. Subsequently, the scaffold was filled with melted PEG by a vacuum infiltration process. The prepared phase change composite with 20% boron nitride content exhibited a thermal conductivity of about 1.84 W m−1 K−1 along with good shape stability and high-energy storage density. Apart from controlling the microstructure of the scaffold, Tang et al.147 tuned the degree of oxidation of graphene oxide prior to 3D assembly and studied its impact on the shape stability of the PCM. For the practical use of PCMs, mechanical properties are always a matter of interest in materials science. In this regard, Xu and coworkers148 employed a durometer and nanoindentation testing to investigate the mechanical properties of the wax and graphene aerogel-based phase change composite. Durometer testing revealed that the phase change composite is much harder than pure wax at both room temperature and above the melting temperature of the PCM. Nanoindentation testing verified that the phase change composite is 3–7 times harder and less strain-rate sensitive than pure PCM.
3D porous CNT architectures. 
In the category of nanoporous matrices, carbon nanotube macrostructures including carbon nanotube sponge (CNTS) and carbon nanotube arrays (CNTAs) were first employed by our group to encapsulate organic PCMs. The CNTS is an interconnected network of CNTs in 3D form, prepared by the CVD method (Fig. 14B). The density of the CNTS is comparable to that of the lightest aerogels and its porosity is more than 99% of its volume.149 These characteristics are ideal to use CNTS as a porous scaffold. Chen et al.150 loaded more than 90% of paraffin wax in CNTS using a simple solution infiltration method (Fig. 14A). The authors demonstrated that the capillary action of the pores and the C–H π interactions between the paraffin molecules and CNTs prevent the leakage of the PCM. In addition, a significant rise in phase change enthalpy was observed due to the strong π–π interactions between wax molecules and the CNT walls (Fig. 14C). Moreover, the thermal conductivity of the composite was enhanced 6.7 times compared to that of pure wax. The excellent electrical conductivity and sunlight absorption nature of CNTS are promising for solar-thermal and electro-thermal energy conversion and storage. In another study, Liu and coworkers used a vertically aligned carbon nanotube array as an elastic skeleton to load eicosanoic (C-20) and prepared an anisotropic phase change composite (Fig. 14D and E). The embedded network of aligned CNTs enhanced the thermal conductivity of the phase change composite. The authors further modulated the areal density (CNT distribution) along the lateral direction by uniaxial deformation and improved the PCM crystallinity by compressed confinement. The prepared phase change composite can be triggered by low voltage with high electro to heat conversion and storage efficiency as compared to CNTS.151

Carbon aerogel. 
Graphene and CNT based porous scaffolds exhibit high thermal conductivity and encapsulation abilities but due to high cost, the industrial utilization of these scaffolds is not favored by the market. In order to reduce the cost of the composite system, carbon aerogel could be a better candidate with a compromise in some of the properties. Like other supporting materials, carbon aerogel exhibits an interconnected porous structure, high surface area, low weight and reasonable thermal conductivity.152 In order to prepare a phase change composite Huang et al.24 confined octadecanol within carbon aerogel derived from glucose. Prior to PCM infiltration, the aerogel exhibited a large number of mesopores but after composite fabrication the pores were filled by liquid PCM. The authors found that the phase transition of loaded PCM was affected significantly due to the nanoconfinement effect. Yang and coworkers153 devised a hybrid aerogel by combining defect-free graphene particles and microcrystalline cellulose. The 3D porous network ensured the shape stability of the PCM and additives provided a conductive pathway. With 5.3 wt% loading of graphene particles, the composite exhibited a thermal conductivity of 1.35 W m−1 K−1, which is 463% higher than that of the phase change composite without graphene additives. Fang et al.154 fabricated a graphene-based anisotropic carbon aerogel by using an environmentally friendly biopolymer. Then the composite was prepared by the melt-infiltration process.
Expanded graphite. 
Expanded graphite is a 3D porous material, prepared by acid treatment of natural graphite flakes. In the field of PCMs, expanded graphite is a highly efficient and cost-effective packaging material and thus many studies have been expanded around it.155–159 Duan et al. loaded CaCl2·6H2O into expanded graphite by vacuum soaking, and the thermal conductivity of the composite reached 8.796 W m−1 K−1 when the loading capacity was 50%, which is 14 times that of pure PCM.160 Wang et al. used expanded graphite to encapsulate sebacic acid, a typical medium temperature latent heat storage material. The composite system with a PCM mass percentage of 85% exhibited a phase transition temperature of 128 °C with the phase change enthalpy as high as ca. 187 J g−1. Yang et al. used expanded graphite to load the ternary eutectic mixture of fatty acids including myristic acid, palmitic acid and stearic acid.161 The composite exhibited a phase transition temperature of about 42 °C and a latent heat of about 152 J g−1 with better cyclic performance, thermal stability and thermal conductivity. It was also demonstrated that the thermal conductivity and latent heat of the composite system both increased by increasing the interlayer distance of the expanded graphite.162 The highest thermal conductivity (3.56 W m−1 K−1) was achieved with a maximum interlayer spacing of 3.418 Å. Moreover, the authors also revealed that the normalized latent heat just decreased 10.8%.


2.4.3. Others. 
In the category of nonporous supporting materials, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and interconnected porous polymers have also been utilized.163–165 MOFs are an emerging class of 3D crystalline porous materials comprising organic ligands and metal centers, joined in an orderly arrangement to establish a regular crystalline porous structure. The high internal porosity and large surface area of MOFs can be used to load guest molecules including gases, drugs, water, polymers and phase change molecules.166,167 However, in the field of PCMs, the use of MOFs as solid supports is relatively new. For the first time, the Wang group introduced a MOF based solid matrix to load PCM. Specifically, the authors used Cr-MIL-101-NH2 as a solid matrix and fatty acids as a phase change material to fabricate PCM@MOF composites. The authors further investigated the effect of functional groups of MOFs on the loading abilities and found that MOFs bearing NH2 groups load a higher mass percentage of fatty acids than their non-functionalized counterparts. The highest loading capacity achieved was up to 70% with a phase change enthalpy of 120.53 J g−1, which is practically attractive for low temperature applications.168 In another study, Andriamitantsoa et al.169 utilized high surface area and high porosity, Cr3+ and bridging benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid based metal–organic xerogels (MOGs) to prepare phase change composites of fatty acids. The authors enhanced both the loading capacity and energy storage density of the composite system, compared to the MOF based system. Pure MOF and MOG based matrices can only be used to confine PCMs and not to improve the thermal properties. In order to develop a highly conductive and form stable phase change composite, highly porous carbon derived from MOF-5 has been loaded with PEG. In porous carbon, some additional large pores are developed compared to pure MOFs by the evaporation of metal oxide during the carbonization process of pure MOFs. The high surface area (2551 m2 g−1) and larger pore volume (3.05 cm−3 g−1) of porous carbon are responsible for the high adsorption capacity and shape stability. Moreover, the thermal conductivity of the phase change composite with 92.5 wt% of PCM is about 50 times higher than that of pure PCM.170 A summary of the thermo-physical properties of confined PCMs is presented in Table 2.

In general, the crystallization of subnanometer-sized confined PCMs is restricted due to the confinement effect. However, in the aforementioned studies, a complete understanding of nanoconfined systems has not been deeply explored. In order to understand the thermal transition behavior of PEG at the molecular level under a confined environment, Uemura et al.27 incorporated PEG molecular chains into the nanochannels of MOFs, comprising different pore size and surface functionalities (Fig. 15A). The impregnation of PEG-600 into the MOF channels was driven by simple melt processing and the conformation of the confined PEG molecular chains was revealed by molecular dynamics to support structural characterization. The molecular dynamics structure shows that the conformation of the PEG molecular chains altered from helical (bulk) to almost linear (confined) with slight distortion and thus increasing trans conformation (Fig. 15B). The effect of pore size on the phase change behavior of confined PEG was studied using channels of different pore size (1a–e) ranging from 0.4 to 1.1 nm. In contrast to classical thermodynamics, melting of PEG was observed even in subnanometre-sized channels and exhibited a unique non-monotonic behavior (Fig. 15C). As the pore diameter of the MOF channel became narrower, the melting temperature of the encapsulated PEG decreased and reached the lowest value (−53 °C) in the case of 1c. However, a further decrease in the pore diameter led to an increase in the melting temperature of the encapsulated PEG. It is noteworthy that no phase transition was observed in the case of PEG confined in the smallest pore dimension (1e), probably due to the single-chain confinement in the channels. In addition to pore diameter, the impact of the pore surface environment on the phase change behavior of nanoconfined PEG was studied by considering three channels (1d, 1f and 1g) of almost the same pore size but different surface functionalities. It was found that the interaction of PEG molecular chains with the pore surface follows the order 1f > 1d > 1g and thereby the melting temperature of confined PEG follows the same order. Moreover, in contrast to the bulk PEG, in which the phase transition temperature increases linearly with increasing molecular weight, the confined PEG in the 1a channel exhibited the opposite trend against molecular weight (Fig. 15D). This abnormal behavior can be understood by the fact that the solid PEG chains are destabilized in the subnanometer-sized channels. In this case, the destabilization effect per chain would be more influential when longer chains are confined. Based on the above discussion, it can be concluded that the pore size of porous coordination materials is too small to effectively realize the phase transition of confined PCMs for thermal energy application. However, in order to fabricate functional phase change composites using MOFs as supporting materials, the published literature provides a guideline to enhance the pore size of MOFs and thus of functional composites.171,172

Conclusively, nanoporous confinement of PCMs is a more mature and industrially applicable technology, which combines different supporting materials with PCMs depending on the desired properties. The porous encapsulation technology is generally exploited to improve the inherent thermal conductivity and shape stability of PCMs. The encapsulation efficiency strongly depends on the pore size and pore volume of the porous scaffold as well as on the nature of the confined PCM. The role of pore size is critical in determining the possibility of infiltration while the pore volume determines the overall encapsulation efficiency. For instance, if the pore aperture is smaller than the overall molecular size of the PCM, the infiltration efficiency would be drastically limited. In contrast, the encapsulation efficiency is also limited when the pore size is too big, which leads to uncontrolled leaking of the PCM from the host materials upon reversible phase transition. In addition, the pore volume determines the overall uptake of PCM and thus the loading capacity. The pore size of the host not only affects the encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity but also determines the ease of crystallization of the PCM inside the host. For instance, the degree of freedom inside smaller pores limits the movement of PCM molecules, which directly limits the reversible crystallization. In comparison, the larger pores provide enough space for crystal growth due to lower interfacial interactions between host and PCM molecules. In addition to pore chemistry, the molecular length of the confined PCM is also critical in determining the reversible crystallization since smaller molecules would undergo crystallization more easily than larger molecules. Since organic PCMs do not undergo phase transition in pores below the size of ∼5 nm, the more suitable size for PCM encapsulation lies in the range of ∼5–50 nm in order to effectively realize the reversible crystallization in addition to improved thermo-physical properties. In contrast to the above discussion, the supercooling is generally reduced in smaller pores owing to strong interfacial contact between the PCM and host materials. The larger pores in comparison would have lower interfacial contact with the PCM, where most of the PCM is centered towards the core without having any direct contact with the pore wall which limits nucleation.136 Hence, large pores are not effective in reducing the supercooling. Thus, the selection of PCM and host materials is critical in balancing the requirement of supercooling and reversible crystallization. In summary, the pore size must not be too small to restrict crystallization and must not be too big to allow uncontrolled supercooling in the composite materials.

3. Applications of nanoconfined PCMs
Nanoconfined PCMs have been characterized for presenting four unique properties: (1) solid to liquid phase transition, (2) a large amount of energetic changes, (3) stabilization of temperature and (4) a variation in thermal conduction during phase transition. These unique characteristics have been utilized in various fields. For example, the solid to liquid phase transition of PCMs over a certain temperature can effectively release the confined guest molecules and has potential in biomedical applications. Energetic changes (latent heat) during phase transition offer tremendous potential to meet the growing energy demands for cooling and heating applications. Moreover, the addition of colored and conductive skeletons to PCMs enables them to store solar and electrical energies respectively as latent heat. Similarly, the isothermal phase transition ability can be used for thermal management of electronics, packaging of temperature sensitive products and other cooling and heating related applications. On the other hand, the scattering of phonons upon solid to liquid phase change significantly decreases the thermal conductivity of PCMs, which can be used to realize thermal rectification. In this section, we have presented the aforementioned applications in detail.
3.1. Energy conversion and storage

Solar-thermal energy harvesting and storage. 
Sun is a fundamental, economical and sustainable source of energy. Every day, the earth receives a large amount of solar energy from the sun. Nevertheless, effective utilization of solar energy is still limited as the sunlight is available only in the daytime, but more heat and electricity is needed at night. Therefore, storage of solar energy is crucial for the efficient utilization of renewable solar energy and the reduction of global warming. In this regard, materials that allow for solar energy harvesting and storage to meet the energy demands have been gaining attention in recent years. Especially, the conversion of solar energy into thermal energy and then the storage of this converted thermal energy as latent heat by using PCMs is operationally simple and cost-effective. However, the majority of PCMs are colorless and remain unable to harness solar energy; photon-capturing materials with high solar to thermal conversion efficiency are always needed. For this, plasmonic nanoparticles,177 organic dyes178 and carbon-based materials including carbon black, graphene,179 CNTs,92,180 graphite foam181 and carbon foam182 have been extensively incorporated into PCMs to effectively absorb solar radiation. Noble metal nanocrystals (Au) have comparatively shown better performance under resonance conditions.183 Upon irradiation, nanocrystals convert photo energy into plasmonic heat at the nanoscale and the generated heat is stored within the bulk PCM in the form of latent heat.177 On the other hand, organic dyes doped within PCMs serve as effective “photon capturers and molecular heaters” and also offer higher photo-thermal conversion efficiency (η > 0.94) under selected wavelength regions.184 High conversion efficiency is attributed to the electronic transition from the low-energy ground state (π) to the high-energy excited state (π*σ*) caused by the sunlight input. These electronic transitions (dπ–dπ*) and (dπ–dσ*) are short-lived and suddenly dissociate into the ground state by releasing thermal energy, which is stored by PCM in the form of latent heat during solid–liquid or solid–solid phase transition.185 However, the thermal degradation of organic dyes at higher temperature and poor performance under the full solar spectrum restrict the practical utilization of dye integrated solar energy storage systems. Moreover, in the presented literature, the PCM is not confined at the nanoscale but just a form-stable composite with solid–solid phase transition.
In order to fabricate nanoconfined PCMs for solar-thermal energy storage, many researchers have presented carbon-based solar absorbers. Considering the design of composite materials, carbon materials can be utilized as a shell in the core–shell confinement of PCMs and as a porous skeleton in the pore-confined PCMs. For the shell, graphene71 and CNTs179 have been adopted along with other supporting materials. In pore-confined PCM composites, carbon aerogel, carbonized SiO2 aerogel, graphene aerogel and CNT macrostructures have been investigated. During solar irradiation, the carbon skeleton in the composite system absorbs all the radiation and converts solar energy into thermal energy, which is stored by the PCM during melting. The melting behavior of the PCM can be realized from temperature–time curves of the composites (Fig. 16b). Initially, the temperature rises exponentially and then an inflection point appears in the time–temperature curves, which indicates the melting of the PCM within the skeleton. After complete melting, again the temperature increases in a linear manner and the composite behaves sensibly. Similarly, macroscopic heat release can be realized by the plateau appearing in the time–temperature curves during the freezing process of the PCM under natural cooling. This melting and freezing plateau seen in time–temperature curves cannot be realized in individual constituents of the composite due to the poor photo-absorption of pure PCMs and the non-melting behavior of carbon skeletons (Fig. 16a). The solar to thermal conversion and storage efficiency (η) of phase change composites can be determined by eqn (1): (1)In eqn (1), m is the mass of the composite, ΔH is the phase change enthalpy, A is the exposed surface area of the sample, P is the power of irradiation light and t is the time taken for phase transition. The solar thermal energy storage performance of various phase change composites is presented in Table 3.

Apart from that, the harvested thermal energy can be used to fulfill the demands of renewable energy devices that are limited by the intermittency.146 Very recently, Cottrill et al. utilized thermal fluctuations to generate electrical power using a phase change composite based on a broadband thermal resonator.191 The authors validated that the generation of electrical power for thermal resonators is proportional to the thermal effusivity of used thermal mass. The authors generated a persistent power of 350 mV and 1.3 mW from 10 °C diurnal temperature differences.


Electro to thermal energy conversion and storage. 
Over the last two decades, attention has been paid to the use of PCMs in thermo-solar energy storage systems, where it is required to store thermal energy during the sunshine for use at night. However, the countries close to the North Pole experience a lack of sunlight for part of the winter. In this regard, a number of strategies have been presented to drive phase transition.142,150,192 Our group introduced the electrically conductive phase change composite for electro-thermal energy conversion and storage.150 A conductive composite was fabricated by infiltrating PCM melt into the pores of the conductive skeleton. So far, graphite foam,181,188 expanded graphite,189 graphene and CNT macrostructures142,150,190 have been utilized. On applying a small voltage, the conductive skeleton converts electrical energy into heat, which can be stored as latent heat during the melting of PCMs within the composite. Storage and release of thermal energy can be realized by time–temperature curves of phase change composites just like solar-thermal energy conversion and storage. In the case of an empty skeleton carbon nanotube array (CNTA), the rise in temperature can be observed by means of voltage, without presenting any inflection point before saturation values in the temperature evaluation curves (Fig. 17A). On the other hand, temperature evaluation curves of the eicosane (C20) filled carbon nanotube array (CNTA-C20) exhibit the inflection point during the electro heating and natural cooling cycle, suggesting the melting and freezing of the PCM respectively (Fig. 17B). Electro to heat conversion and storage efficiency can be determined by eqn (2).151 (2)In eqn (2), m is the mass and ΔH is the phase change enthalpy of the composite and U, I and t are the voltage, current and time duration required for phase change respectively. In order to achieve high efficiency, the phase change composite should have high-energy storage capacity and high electrical conductivity so that it can be driven by low voltage. The comparative electro-thermal energy conversion and storage performance of composite PCMs is presented in Table 3. Apart from that, the Shchukin group introduced the concept of electro-thermal energy conversion and storage and fabricated a practical device. The authors incorporated alkane based stable and conductive capsules into a nanocarbon-based Joule heating system to eliminate the convective heat dissipation (Fig. 17C–F). At a loading of 5% PCM capsules, the working temperature is enhanced by 30% at a low voltage and ambient temperature.

Thermal managements. 
Isothermal phase transition of PCMs enables them to sink or transfer a high flux of heat from a hot reservoir and can be used for thermal management of batteries, electronic devices, high power lasers, photovoltaic and thermoelectric systems, exothermic chemical reactions, industrial units and packaging of temperature sensitive products.193,194 Each use requires a specific confined PCM depending on the operating temperature range and the usage requirements.195 For example, in a microchannel cooling system, a heat transfer fluid is used. The viscosity and heat capacity of the fluid determine the thermal runaway performance. The heat capacity of single-phase fluids is very low, so in order to prepare an effective fluid possessing high heat capacity, core–shell encapsulated PCM particles are added into the base solution to prepare a kind of latent heat thermal fluid slurry. The latent heat of PCM particles greatly enhances the heat sink capability of the fluid, thereby leading to a better heat transfer rate in comparison to a single phase system.196,197 However, the fracturing of PCM macro and microparticles under high pressure enhances the viscosity of the fluid, which ultimately reduces the heat transfer efficiency and increases the input power needed for the pumping.198,199 To address these issues, nanoencapsulated PCM particles have been added to the base solution. The enhancement of heat transfer for various combinations of core, shell and base solution has been presented in the literature.200–202 Typically, in comparison to pure water the addition of 28% volume fraction of polymer encapsulated wax nanoparticles enhances the heat transfer coefficient by 70% and 50% for spray cooling and jet impingement respectively.48 Suspension of melamine resin encapsulated wax particles in water/ethanol at 5% and 10% volume fraction enhances the convective heat transfer coefficient about 2 times and 3 times, respectively, compared to the base fluid.203 In another study, polymer-encapsulated wax nanoparticles and silica-encapsulated metallic indium nanoparticles were synthesized using the colloid method and then the slurry was prepared by suspending encapsulated PCM nanoparticles in water and polyolefin for potential low and high temperature applications, respectively. The heat transfer coefficient of water containing 10% paraffin nanoparticles by mass and polyolefin containing 30% indium nanoparticles by mass is 1.75 and 1.6 times higher than that of the corresponding base fluids.49 Later, Wu et al. concluded that the coalescence of indium particles within a single-phase fluid is not a big issue, so indium nanoparticles can be used without encapsulation.69 Other than core–shell nanoparticles, PCM carrying CNTs have also been utilized to prepare the latent heat thermal fluid. The inner cavity of CNTs is used to infiltrate the PCM in order to avoid the sticking of the PCM to the walls of the channel while the conductive shell enhances the heat transfer capabilities. In a typical study, the suspension of CNTs carrying PCM was prepared by using a surfactant and then the suspension was pumped through two different microchannels of 603 μm or 1803 μm in diameter under constant heat flux. The results show that the temperature reduced by ∼2 °C with aqueous solution of the surfactant without CNTs and by an additional ∼1.90 °C by adding wax intercalating CNTs up to 3 wt%.84
In addition to microchannels, adding nanoencapsulated PCMs to exothermic reaction mixtures offers a new way to control the reaction temperature. As a proof to concept, silica encapsulated paraffin and indium particles as nano heat sinks were added to minimize the gel effect of the polymerization reaction and to control the temperature of the catalytic reaction. The local hot spots induced by inhomogeneous catalyst packing, fluctuation in reactant concentration and immediate change of reaction rate lead to the melting of nanoparticle cores so as to mitigate thermal runaway by storing energies released from exothermic reactions to latent heat melting. In this way the reaction rate does not rise abruptly at the initial stage due to the isothermal removal of heat energy by quenching the local spots.67,204 Apart from that, thermal management of batteries and other devices demands highly conductive phase change composites such as PCM infiltrated 3D graphene and CNT macrostructures. The reported literature generally points towards possible usage of PCMs for battery safety; however, no successful report, to the best of our knowledge, presenting the actual use of confined PCM for battery safety has surfaced to date. In essence, the field of PCMs for batteries is still evolving and needs more research towards practical implementation.

3.2. Thermal rectification
Thermal rectification refers to the phenomenon where thermal transport along a specific axis is dependent upon the direction of the heat flow. The devices based on this mechanism can manipulate heat in a favorable manner, such as transporting heat from electronics to the environment. Therefore, the key components of expensive devices can be protected under high temperature conditions. The types and strategies to realize thermal rectification have been reviewed in the literature.205,206 So far, several mechanisms based on evaporation/condensation, strain at two material contacts, thermal potential barriers, infrared emission, the phonon anharmonicity in lattices and the variation in thermal coefficient at the junctions between two materials have been effectively utilized to realize thermal rectification. As an emerging class, PCMs have the ability to exhibit variation in thermal transport during phase transition, and can be used to effectively realize thermal rectification. The reduction in thermal transport is caused by the scattering of phonons upon solid to liquid phase transition. By forming a junction of PCM and non-PCM or PCM and PCM, the heat flows at different speeds in the forward and reverse direction through the interface.207–211 As a result, a solid-state thermal rectification can be realized. Our group constructed a device based on a form-stable thermal rectifier by introducing two PCMs having opposite polarity into an rGO aerogel. The aerogel had negligible influence on the thermal conductivity of PCMs. Therefore, it functioned as an insulating container to support the device. The structure and rectification ratio of the PCM junction rectifiers are shown in Fig. 18.209 The phase-dependent thermal conductivity leads to the asymmetric heat flow in forward and reverse direction. Therefore, the PCM junction attains a thermal rectification ratio of 1.23 (Fig. 18D).

(B) Schematic structure of the simulation model by the FEM method for the forward and reverse direction. (C) The temperature dependent thermal conductivity of both ends. (D) The temperature dependent thermal rectification coefficient.209 Reproduced with the permission of Nature Publishing Group. 
Another thermal diode was developed by using PNIPAM as a phase changing material. The PNIPAM is applied for thermal diodes because of its unique property that its change in thermal conductivity is proportional to elevated temperature.207 PNIPAM becomes hydrophobic when the temperature is higher than the lower-critical-solution-temperature, squeezing the previously bound water out. The current of water creates a pathway for heat transfer. Thus, heat flow was higher when the PNIPAM side was heated until the temperature reached the “breakdown” threshold. When coupled with non-PCM, the junction can achieve a rectification ratio on the order of 2.207 The ratio can be enhanced to 2.6 if PNIPAM is contacted with octadecane, whose thermal conductivity decreases upon phase transition.208 In light of PCM-related thermal rectifiers, a thermal diode bridge was fabricated by the Strano group.210 The design of the thermal diode and the bridge device is shown in Fig. 19A and B. Similar to an electrical counterpart, the thermal diode bridge can convert the received temperature oscillation into a unipolar output beyond the working temperature. To measure the temperature difference output, an internal thermoelectric sensor is placed between the thermal diodes. The bridge works in both a closed circuit and an open circuit, while the output in a closed circuit is firmly unipolar (Fig. 19D).

Further improving the rectification ratio requires combination of suitable PCMs. The enhanced effect can be achieved by finding materials whose intrinsic thermal conductivity varies upon phase transition or temperature elevation. In addition, the selective impregnation of additives in device design can also be used to vary the directional dependent thermal transport. Therefore, the rectification performance can be improved by altering the composition of the PCM. Another perspective is to investigate the effect of the porous support on the form-stability of PCM based thermal rectifiers. Further research will also be recommended for new applications based on thermal diodes.
3.3. Temperature-controlled drug delivery
The solid to liquid phase transition of certain PCMs close to normal human body temperature can control the release of drug molecules and offer a temperature-regulated smart drug delivery system (DDS). Below the melting point, the PCM remains in the solid state and restricts the diffusion of drug molecules, whereas above the melting point, the PCM becomes liquid and releases the loaded drug instantly. Different designs of DDSs in which drug molecules are encapsulated in either hollow nanoparticles, core–shell particles or mesoporous particles along with PCMs or PCMs as a gate-keeper to modulate drug release behaviour have been thoroughly investigated. In addition, photo-therapeutic agents such as plasmonic nanoparticles and organic dyes, or magneto-therapeutic agents are equally crucial to trigger the melting of PCMs. Most importantly, selection of suitable therapeutic agents and PCMs is fundamental in the design of efficient and biocompatible DDSs. For the selection of PCMs, long chain alcohols (1-tetradecanol), fatty acids and their eutectic mixture are promising candidates.212–214
Considering the excellent photo-thermal effect of plasmonic Au nanoparticles and controlled release of PCMs, Younan Xia and coworkers presented a versatile nanoscale, thermo-regulated DDS by filling the hollow interiors of Au nanocages with PCM 1-tetradecanol premixed with two exemplary drugs Rhodamine 6G (R6G) and methylene blue (MB) (Fig. 20A–C). Herein, PCM acts as a medium to load the drug molecules as well as a gatekeeper to control the diffusion of the drug in response to the changing temperature. Below the melting point, PCM remains in the solid state and restricts the diffusion of the drug molecules whereas melting of the PCM is triggered after exposure to direct heating or high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), thereby allowing the release of confined drugs through small holes on the surface. The release profile of a PCM-based DDS is presented in Fig. 20D and E.215

Singamaneni and coworkers introduced surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy to monitor the release of Raman active drugs in vivo from Au nanocages noninvasively.216 In addition to IR responsive systems, a redox-responsive dual-stimuli system has also been demonstrated by filling the interior of Au nanocages with premixed PCM and drug.217 In another similar study, caged gold nanorods loaded with PCM and drug were utilized as a near IR-controlled drug delivery vehicle. The strong plasmonic coupling between the outer shell of the nanocage and the inner rod can effectively enhance the photo-thermal efficiency. Rather than hollow nano-systems, mesoporous structures based on a Au core and a mesoporous SiO2 shell have also been presented.218,219 In this hybrid system, the Au core provides photosensitivity and the SiO2 shell is used to load drugs into the surface mesopores. The role of the PCM is similar to the aforementioned examples and it is used to load and release the drug molecules with respect to the changing temperature. In another typical study, a transdermal delivery system was reported based on block copolymer composite micelles consisting of PCM, Au nanoparticles and hydrophobic drug encapsulated in the core of the micelles. In principle, visible light (λ = 520 nm) was irradiated to trigger the melting of the PCM via the photothermal effect of Au nanoparticles resulting in the release of drug molecules along with the liquid PCM.220 In the category of inorganic photo-thermal agents, other than Au nanostructures, graphene,221 copper chalcogenides (Cu9S5)222 coated with mesoporous SiO2 and mesoporous Prussian blue nanoparticles223 have also been successfully utilized to facilitate controlled drug release using PCM as a substrate.
On the other hand, fabrication of hollow224 or mesoporous225 magnetic nanoparticles containing drug-loaded PCMs allows the delivery of drugs in response to external stimuli. For instance, in a magnetic nanoparticle based DDS, an external alternating magnetic field is responsible for the melting of the PCM ultimately allowing the controlled diffusion of entrapped drug molecules. In order to develop an all organic drug delivery platform, Younan Xia and coworkers introduced a facile DDS based on a corked microbottle.226 The corked microbottle comprised hollow polystyrene (PS) particles with holes on their surface. These holes or voids were first used for quick and efficient loading of small drug molecules or even nanoparticles and then corked with PCM for temperature-mediated controlled drug release (Fig. 21A–C). The main idea of the solid PCM cork was to either completely block or release the encapsulated drug molecules while the temperature was below or above the melting point of the PCM, respectively. As a proof of concept, the authors used a fluorescent dye, Rhodamine B, as a model drug. In order to investigate the thermosensitive release behavior, the payload was heated from 25 °C to the melting point of the PCM. Until 37 °C, the PCM cap remained in the solid form and almost negligible release was observed in four days; however, above the melting point of the PCM, the dyes were released instantly due to the opening of the holes. The release profile is presented in Fig. 21D. In addition to a single PCM, the authors also utilized a binary PCM cap in order to trigger faster drug release. Binary PCM is a mixture of two different PCMs that exhibit unique phase transition behavior at eutectic composition. Above or below the eutectic composition, the binary PCM system does not behave uniquely. In the case of 1-tetradecanol and lauric acid, the melting points of the individual PCMs are 38 °C and 43 °C respectively; however when mixed together at 0.6 volume ratio of 1-tetradecanol to lauric acid, the melting point of the binary PCM reduced to 28 °C. The depression in the melting point leads to the fastest release of eutectic composition as compared to other compositions of binary PCM or pure 1-tetradecanol. The release profile of the binary system with different weight ratios is presented in Fig. 21E. In another recent work, a simple and smart intracellular DDS was developed by encapsulating an anticancer drug and near IR absorbing dye into the nanoparticles of a eutectic mixture of two naturally occurring fatty acids such as lauric and stearic acid. The resultant mixture exhibited a well-defined melting point (39 °C) and efficient release in response to near IR irradiation.227

4. Summary and future prospects
In recent years, phase change TES has been gaining significant attention for being cost-effective in nature and able to store a large amount of thermal energy with small temperature difference for lengthier cycles. Nevertheless, the undesired properties including phase separation, supercooling, corrosion, volume expansion, low thermal conductivity and leakage during the phase transition of the majority of bulk PCMs necessitate additional modifications. The confinement of PCMs is an effective way to overcome these drawbacks as well as to improve the thermo-physical properties. Owing to the small size, large surface area, controlled volume expansion, reduced reactivity with the external environment and high heat transfer rate, the nanoconfinement of PCMs has received tremendous attention. In this review, we have provided a basic guideline of different confinement designs of PCMs at the nanoscale. The confinement strategies are categorized into four methods including core–shell (0D), longitudinal (1D), interfacial (2D) and porous (3D), based on design dimensions. Core–shell confinement is advantageous to overcome phase separation and supercooling problems mostly associated with inorganic PCMs. In this regard, several organic and inorganic shell materials have been adopted to encapsulate the PCM core. Inorganic shell materials are rigid and have a strong influence on the phase transition properties of encapsulated PCMs, whereas the formation of an organic shell is easy to process. Longitudinal confinement is also a kind of core–shell confinement at 1D scale and has the advantage of being practically applicable due to large domain size. Interfacial confinement deals with the interface interaction of PCMs with 2D materials. However, it has been less studied due to the weakening of interface interactions above the phase transition temperature of confined PCMs. Among others, porous confinement is a widely accepted and more mature technology. Several nanoporous scaffolds including silica, graphite, graphene, CNTs and coordination framework macrostructures have been utilized to confine most of the organic PCMs. Porous confinement of PCMs simultaneously offers a solution to leakage and low thermal conductivity. Nevertheless, the application of this technology cannot be extended to encapsulate salt hydrate based PCMs as the water of crystallization may evaporate from the pores in the melted state upon exposure to the external environment. The evaporation would affect the reversibility of the phase transition of confined PCMs. In addition, PCM property oriented applications including energy conversion and storage, thermal rectification and temperature controlled drug delivery have been reviewed thoroughly. Generally, core–shell confined PCMs are favorable for drug delivery and textiles related applications. On the other hand, thermal rectification and energy storage systems require high conductivity, so pore-confined PCMs could be a better choice for these applications.
Despite the recent advancement of nanoconfined PCMs in the applied and fundamental research field, several issues still need to be addressed in future research, including the following key points. (1) In core–shell confinement, the NC production yield is quite low to meet the industrial demand for building and many other applications. Therefore, the search for new synthesis methods with high production yield needs further research. (2) Undoubtedly, the problems of inorganic PCMs are more severe than those of organic ones but encapsulation of organic PCMs is widely studied. Therefore, more focus on the encapsulation of inorganic PCMs is inevitable. (3) In an effort to overcome the energy storage loss due to the addition of inactive shell materials in the NC structure, encapsulation of solid–liquid PCMs with solid–solid PCMs would be a promising design. The solid–solid PCM shell will not only work as a supporting material to encapsulate the solid–liquid PCM but will also be able to store energy. (4) Similarly, the use of solid–solid PCMs as a sheath in the core–sheath nanofiber structure would be advantageous to improve the energy storage performance. (5) In the case of PCM intercalation inside CNTs, the filling ratio is quite low due to the surface energy barrier. Therefore, the selective surface functionalization of CNTs can provide a route to overcome the energy barrier and ultimately high PCM filling content. (6) Despite the intense studies on the porous confinement of PCMs, some minor issues are still associated with the wide pore size distribution of scaffolds. For instance, in addition to nanopores, porous scaffolds also possess macropores (μm size). Macropores remain unable to hold the liquid PCMs at higher temperature for lengthier cycles and cause leakage. Regarding this obstacle, filling of solid–solid PCMs within porous scaffolds (even μm size) would be a better choice for the practical utilization of phase change composites. (7) In addition, regarding the issue of porous confinement of salt hydrates as mentioned before, dual packaging can be utilized by combining two technologies together in future research. For instance, the core–shell NCs can be confined within the pores of a porous substrate to obtain better results.

Broader context
Thermal energy storage technologies play an important role in the growth of the sustainable use of energy in heating and cooling applications including solar energy harvesting, off-peak electricity storage and thermal management of buildings, vehicles, and electrochemical and electronic devices. Latent heat storage using phase change materials (PCMs) is one of the actively pursued technologies, which is cost-effective, operationally simple and has the advantage of high-energy storage density. However, the broad adoption of this technology is limited due to intrinsic problems, including leakage, phase separation, supercooling and low heat transfer rate, associated with PCMs. The confinement of PCMs at the nanoscale is an effective way to overcome these drawbacks as well as to improve the thermophysical properties without affecting the overall energy storage performance. This paper provides a state-of-the-art understanding of various confinement strategies for PCMs and prospective applications in diverse fields. The key insights and trends presented in this review offer a new avenue as to how efficiently PCMs can be confined in the future energy storage infrastructure.
