    , Accepted 25th January 2022First published on 28th January 2022AbstractA supported single-atom catalyst provides an opportunity to make full use of noble metals with optimized efficiency and minimal amount. For photocatalytic applications, organometal halide perovskites are greatly ideal candidates as substrate materials for supporting single-atom catalysts because of their excellent properties and remarkable performance in the photoelectric area. However, atomically dispersing noble metals on organometal halide perovskites stably and firmly remains a challenge. Here, we realize the preparation of single-atom Pt immobilized on FAPbBr3−xIx (FA = CH(NH2)2) perovskite substrates through self-adsorption and photo-reduction, as a superb hydrogen evolution photocatalyst for hydrohalic acid splitting. Theoretical and experimental investigations show that Pt atoms are immobilized individually and coordinated with surface halide anions by replacing formamidinium groups. The developed Pt/FAPbBr3−xIx (FAPbBr3−xIx loaded with Pt single-atoms) sample shows an enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of 682.6 μmol h−1 (100 mg) under simulated sunlight irradiation (AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2, irradiation area of π cm2), with an exciting STH (solar-to-hydrogen efficiency) of 4.50%. This work provides a platform that facilitates the synthetic strategy for designing a halide ion coordinated single-atom catalyst, enhancing the photocatalytic performance of perovskite materials, and extending the boundary of the conventional supporting substrate and research fields for single-atom catalysts.

Broader context
To overcome the energy and resource crises, the development of efficient photocatalysts and photocatalytic systems for hydrogen production is urgent and necessary. Recently, organometal halide perovskite (OHP) has been developed for photocatalytic hydrohalic acid splitting. However, material modification methods are very limited and a satisfactory H2 evolution activity has not been obtained yet. In the present work, the FAPbBr3−xIx (FA = CH(NH2)2) OHP with supported Pt single-atoms is prepared as a photocatalyst for HI splitting, which shows a superb photocatalytic H2 evolution activity and an extraordinary STH (solar-to-hydrogen efficiency) of 4.50%. This work combines the advantages of the excellent properties of halide perovskites and the ultrahigh activity of single-atom catalysts, which could shed light on the design and development of halide perovskite-based sing-atom catalysis systems, and may be expected to put the catalytic reaction based on hydrohalic acid splitting a step forward to practical application.

Introduction
Hydrogen (H2) has been considered as a promising clean energy carrier to replace fossil fuels and can be produced by photocatalytic technology by utilizing the inexhaustible solar energy.1–3 Photocatalytic water splitting is one of the most invested projects as a potential way to produce H2; however, the low efficiency is still the greatest impediment to meet the requirement of producing hydrogen at a competitive cost compared to the current industrial hydrogen generation process involving the reforming of fossil fuels. Alternatively, hydrogen iodide (HI) splitting is a promising way to produce H2, which is conventionally investigated in the thermochemical industry in the iodine–sulphur cycle,4–7 and recently intensively investigated in halide perovskite photocatalysis realized in HI solutions saturated with perovskite solutes.8–14 The iodine–sulphur thermochemical hydrogen production cycle, one of the most promising processes for the production of hydrogen through water-splitting, is composed of three chemical reactions: Bunsen reaction (SO2 + I2 + 2H2O = 2HI + H2SO4), H2SO4 decomposition reaction (H2SO4 = SO2 + 1/2O2 + H2O) and HI decomposition reaction (2HI = H2 + I2), which are the key processes to produce hydrogen in the iodine–sulphur cycle. However, the HI decomposition reaction is typically performed between 300 and 500 °C to achieve a high enough kinetic rate while not pushing this entropically unflavoured reaction to an excessive temperature, and a considerable amount of energy is required in this step along with a highly active and stable catalyst for the production of hydrogen in the highly corrosive hydrogen-iodide environment. Therefore, it is of great significance to investigate photocatalytic HI splitting, replacing thermal energy consumption with inexhaustible solar energy. On the other hand, there are some advantages of photocatalytic HI splitting over direct overall water splitting to produce H2 both in thermodynamic and kinetic processes: first, the Gibbs free energy change (ΔrGθ) of HI splitting (ΔrGθ (2HI → H2 + I2) = 103.3 kJ mol−1) is much smaller than that of H2O splitting (ΔrGθ (1/2H2O → H2 + 1/2O2) = 237.2 kJ mol−1), and a lower overpotential is required as well as only two electrons are involved in HI splitting compared to water splitting involving four electrons,15,16 meaning that the former reaction is much easier than the latter in a thermodynamic process; second, hydroiodic acid has a much higher concentration of hydrogen ions, allowing a faster reaction rate to generate H2 in a dynamic process. Therefore, developing efficient photocatalysts for HI splitting is highly desired.
Recently, organometal halide perovskites (OHPs) have caught increasing attention in photocatalytic HI splitting realized in the aqueous acid solution saturated with the corresponding perovskite solute. As we all know, OHPs exhibit several excellent properties, such as a wide light absorption range, a high absorption coefficient, a long carrier diffusion length, and a low surface recombination velocity, which allow them to be promising photocatalysts.17–22 However, a desired high solar-to-hydrogen-efficiency (STH) is not obtained yet, which might mainly result from the low utilization efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers. Generally, loading cocatalysts is an efficient way to facilitate and accelerate the photocatalysis process, because cocatalysts could not only trap electrons to suppress carrier recombination, but also serve as the reaction sites for effective proton reduction. Platinum (Pt) is commonly regarded as the most efficient cocatalyst for the H2 evolution reaction (HER),23,24 as it has the largest work function among many noble metals contributing to more readily capturing electrons, and it is on the peak of the Sabatier volcano concerning the relationship between the exchange current for H2 evolution and the Gibbs free energy of adsorbed atomic hydrogen for noble metals.25,26 However, it does not seem to work satisfyingly by simply loading Pt particles onto the surface of OHP catalysts.27,28 A probable reason is that, in the particular perovskite photocatalytic systems, the dynamic equilibrium exists between the perovskite catalysts and the saturated aqueous solutions, which might cause the falling off of the surface loaded Pt particles. More importantly, the very limited exposed atoms in residual Pt particles result in a low utilization efficiency of the noble metal, failing to effectively trap photogenerated electrons and catalyse proton reduction. Therefore, reducing the size of Pt particles to small clusters, and ultimately to a single atom scale, is an effective way to reduce the loading amount of Pt and maximize the atom efficiency.
Therefore, we are intended to investigate the possibility of combining single-atom catalysts and OHPs to create a novel catalytic system with extraordinary performance and specifically, the expectant OHP loaded with a Pt single-atom would be a promising superb catalyst for the photocatalytic HER. Here, FAPbBr3−xIx (FA = CH(NH2)2) is first considered as the model substrate material, because formamidinium lead trihalide perovskites have a relatively smaller band gap and much better thermal stability than methylammonium perovskites, and more importantly, FA-based perovskites exhibit markedly longer carrier lifetime and carrier diffusion than those of MA-based counterparts,29,30 which provide opportunities to make more use of photo-generated carriers. It is also predicted theoretically that FA-perovskites show better photocatalytic HER performance than MA-perovskites.31 Moreover, it is reported that mixed halide perovskites with specific halogen ion distribution will prolong the carrier dynamics and diffusion length,32,33 and the gradient ion distribution brings about enhanced HER performance in perovskite photocatalysis.34,35 As a consequence, the mixed halide FA-based perovskite FAPbBr3−xIx seems to be a suitable candidate as a promising substrate for supporting single-atom catalysts utilized in photocatalysis.
So far, atomically dispersed noble metal catalysts supported on organometal halide perovskites have not been experimentally realized. Herein, we report that individual single Pt atoms are anchored onto the FAPbBr3−xIx substrate as cocatalysts with high dispersion and stability, a maximum utilization of Pt is realized in the resulting Pt/FAPbBr3−xIx (FAPbBr3−xIx loaded with Pt single-atoms) sample, and the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity in aqueous haloid acid solution is remarkably enhanced, representing a new, highly efficient photocatalytic system for H2 evolution. Density functional theory is employed to build the theoretical model, revealing that halide ions at the surface of the mixed-halide FAPbBr3−xIx perovskite are favourable for providing potentially uniform anchoring sites for the Pt atoms. The FAPbBr3−xIx substrate material is prepared by the anion exchange method in HBr/HI acid solution, followed by the self-adsorption and photoreduction method to load single Pt atoms on the surface of FAPbBr3−xIx particles. The obtained Pt/FAPbBr3−xIx sample shows a surprisingly enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of 682.6 μmol h−1 (100 mg) under simulated sunlight (AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2, irradiation area of π cm2) irradiation, with an extraordinarily high STH of 4.50%. The OHP photocatalyst dispersed with single Pt atoms is correctly characterized, and the single-particle PL technique is performed to investigate time-/space-resolved photoelectron generation and transfer activities, verifying the remarkable effect of Pt single-atoms for enhancing the photocatalytic H2 evolution performance.
Results and discussion
Material design, preparation and characterization

Substrate material preparation and characterization. 
The FAPbBr3 powder sample was first synthesized by a saturated solution co-precipitation method similar to a previous report (Methods section).8,11 The supporting substrate of the FAPbBr3−xIx perovskite was prepared by introducing iodide ions to pure FAPbBr3 through the anion exchange method in HBr/HI mixed haloid acid, and light irradiation was introduced to accelerate the reaction rate.32 The XRD profiles in Fig. 1a reveal that the obtained FAPbBr3 has a cubic configuration with good crystallization,29,36 and after the substitution of I− ions for Br− ions, the diffraction peaks tend to shift to a lower angle caused by the slight expansion of the crystal lattice, while maintaining a steady cubic structure, without showing any characteristic peaks corresponding to FAPbI3. The XRD patterns suggest a partial replacement of bromide ions in FAPbBr3 with iodide ions (Fig. 1b). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that the original sharp edges of FAPbBr3 tend to become blunt after ion exchange (Fig. 1a and Fig. S1, ESI†), caused by the slight dissolution during the ion exchange process, particularly focused on the ridges. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) measurements for a selected area were carried out to explore the surface halide ion distribution and content of the particle. The EDS mapping results in Fig. 1c show uniform distributions of both Br− and I−, indicating the uniform substitution of Br− for I− of the perovskite particles. The I/Br content results shown in Table S1 (ESI†) exhibit an I/Br molar ratio of ∼1:5. To further verify the replacing ratio of I for Br, the Rietveld refinement of the X-ray diffraction pattern was performed, and the deduced result of FAPbBr2.5I0.5 from FAPbBr3 single crystals (Fig. S2, ESI†) is well consistent with the EDS result.

Atoms in green, blue, red, purple, black, brown, and pink represent Pt, Pb, Br, I, C, N, and H. 


Theoretical modelling. 
Theoretically, based on the experimentally measured ratio of Br and I atoms of FAPbBr3−xIx, we construct four different possible structures of FAPbBr3−xIx, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). By comparing the calculation energies of these four systems, our results indicate that the configuration of Fig. S3b (ESI†) is the most stable structure of FAPbBr3−xIx in our work (Table S2, ESI†). Next, for more comprehensive consideration, we take two representative faces of (110) and (001) of cubic FAPbBr3−xIx as the model supporting substrates to load the single Pt atoms by replacing the surface FA groups. In the bulk, FA cations are confined within the anionic framework by a strong electrostatic potential.37,38 However, at the surface layer, the FA species may be replaced. To investigate this possibility, we consider the replacement of FA by the single Pt atom, and the corresponding structures are shown in Fig. 1d–f and Fig. S4 (ESI†). By investigating the adsorption energy, we evaluate the interaction strength between Pt/FA and the FAPbBr3−xIx host, which lacks one surface FA species,Eads = Ehost−pt − (Ehost + EPt)where Ehost and EPt are the energies of the host and the isolated Pt atom in the vacuum, respectively, and Ehost−Pt represents the energy of the Pt atom adsorbed host. A more negative Eads value corresponds to a more stable adsorption state. The adsorption energies of Pt/FA on both the (110) and the (001) surfaces are listed in Table S3 (ESI†). Interestingly, we find that, for both (110) and the (001) surfaces, Pt atoms exhibit much more negative adsorption energy than FA species. This result demonstrates that the single Pt atom can stably replace FA species and adsorb on more than one crystal planes of the FAPbBr3−xIx perovskite. For the sake of simplicity, only the model structure of Pt loaded on the (001) surface with the most stable Pt adsorption energy is selected in the following involved theoretical discussion.


Pt single-atom immobilization and characterization. 
Afterwards, a certain amount of chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6·6H2O) was added to the HBr/HI solution saturated with the perovskite solute and suspended with FAPbBr3−xIx particles with vigorous stirring. Under light irradiation, the Pt species were absorbed and reduced onto the surface of FAPbBr3−xIx particles and the single Pt atoms got anchored individually (Fig. 2a). To determine the actual loading amount of Pt on perovskite particles, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was performed (Fig. S5 and Table S4, ESI†), and the prepared perovskite supported Pt single-atom catalysts loaded with different amounts of Pt are marked as ω-Pt/FAPbBr3−xIx (ω represents the weight percent determined by ICP-OES, wt%). As shown in Fig. 1a, the deposition of Pt atoms on FAPbBr3−xIx does not change the dominant peaks of the XRD pattern of the original perovskite substrate, and there appear no characteristic peaks of Pt, which indicates the absence of crystalline Pt particles in the catalysts.

(b) TEM images and corresponding EDS mapping images of a random area of Pt/FAPbBr3−xIx. STEM-HAADF images of ω-Pt/FAPbBr3−xIx with different Pt loading amounts of (c), 0.7; (d), 1.2; (e), 1.5; (f), 1.8; (g and h), 2.1. (d and e) share the same scale bar with (c). Some of the Pt atoms are circled in red in (c–h), and Pt clusters are circled in green in (h). 
The samples were subsequently investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) with high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF). The SEM images show that most of the FAPbBr3−xIx particles are dodecahedral and some are irregular in shape, with a particle size of 20–50 μm (Fig. S1 ESI†). After the addition and photoreduction loading of Pt, the regular morphology of the material collapses and the surface becomes very rough, while no Pt particles are observed on the surface of the perovskite particles. However, the energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) mappings of Pt/FAPbBr3−xIx shown in Fig. 2b and Fig. S6 (ESI†) present the uniform distribution of the Pt element, proving the existence of Pt in the sample. Hence, the STEM-HAADF characterization was performed because individual heavy atoms in practical catalysts can be discerned in the atomic resolution HAADF images.39–41 As shown in Fig. 2c–f, the images clearly demonstrate the dispersion of isolated Pt atoms with a high number density on the perovskite substrates with 0.7–1.8 wt% Pt loading. As the Pt loading amount increases to 2.1 wt%, the individual Pt atoms tend to aggregate into small clusters consisting of several to tens of Pt atoms (Fig. 2g and h).
The electronic state and atomic environment of Pt atoms on FAPbBr3−xIx supports are further investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption fine structure measurements. As shown in XPS survey spectra (Fig. S7, ESI†), C 1s, N 1s, Pb 4f, Br 3d and I 3d peaks are all detected obviously in both FAPbBr3−xIx and Pt/FAPbBr3−xIx, and Pt 4f is also detected in the Pt/FAPbBr3−xIx sample in addition to the above five elements, suggesting the successful loading of Pt species. The high-resolution XPS spectra of each element in the two samples (Fig. 3a–c) reveal that, after the anchoring of Pt single-atoms, the Pb 4f, Br 3d and I 3d spectra all show an obvious positive shift with values of 0.40 eV, 0.35eV and 0.35 eV, respectively, compared with the original FAPbBr3−xIx sample. These results indicate that the electrons in the Pt/FAPbBr3−xIx are largely biased towards the anchored Pt species, which would contribute a lot to the H+ reduction reacted at the Pt sites in the following photocatalytic process. Fig. 3d shows the Pt 4f spectra of Pt foil (Pt (0)), K2PtCl6 (Pt (IV)), and Pt/FAPbBr3−xIx. The Pt 4f spectrum of Pt/FAPbBr3−xIx shows two peaks centered at 75.33 eV and 72.08 eV ascribed to Pt 4f5/2 and Pf 4f7/2 respectively, which locate between Pt (0) of 74.08 eV (Pt 4f5/2), 70.73 eV (Pf 4f7/2) and Pt (IV) of 78.73 eV (Pt 4f5/2), and 75.38 eV (Pf 4f7/2). The results suggest that the valence of Pt in the Pt/FAPbBr3−xIx sample is between 0 and +4, which also indicates that the anchored Pt species are reduced from Pt (IV) in the [PtCl6]2− precursor to a lower valence close to but still higher than Pt (0). Moreover, each of the two peaks can be deconvoluted into two peaks centered at 75.53 eV and 74.43 eV for Pt 4f5/2, and 72.23 eV and 71.23 eV for Pt 4f7/2. The subpeaks in the two cases of Pt (marked as Pt (δ), filled in green; Pt (σ), filled in purple) indicate that the Pt species are in different chemical environments, which can be attributed to different coordination situations of Br or I. The results are consistent well with the DFT calculations and EXAFS analysis.

Fig. 3e shows the evolution of the Pt L3-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectrum of the 1.8-Pt/FAPbBr3−xIx sample, and the reference spectra of Pt foil and H2PtCl6·6H2O. The white line intensities in the spectra reflect the oxidation state of Pt in different samples,39,42 thus the white line intensity of the 1.8-Pt/FAPbBr3−xIx sample, which is between the intensities of Pt foil and H2PtCl6·6H2O, suggesting that the Pt single atom in the Pt/FAPbBr3−xIx sample carries a positive charge, higher than metallic Pt(0) while lower than Pt(IV) in H2PtCl6·6H2O. The evolution of the atomic coordination configuration of Pt was further revealed by extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS), and the Pt EXAFS Fourier transform curves are shown in Fig. 3f. Either the typical Pt–Pt contribution at about 2.7 Å or the Pt–Cl at about 1.9 Å is absent as for the 1.8-Pt/FAPbBr3−xIx sample, strongly indicating that there are no Pt particles, clusters, or chlorides in the sample. Instead, two prominent peaks located at ∼2.0 Å and ∼2.5 Å, may mainly correspond to the Pt–Br and Pt–I bonds, respectively. To obtain a detailed atomic structure and probe the interaction of the Pt atoms with the perovskite support, quantitative EXAFS curve fitting was carried out, and the results for 1.8-Pt/FAPbBr3−xIx, Pt foil and H2PtCl6·6H2O references are displayed in Fig. 3g. The fitting results and the corresponding fitting parameters are listed in Table S5 (ESI†). According to the results, the Pt–Br and Pt–I contributions are determined at distances of 2.46 ± 0.02 Å and 2.58 ± 0.02 Å, respectively, and the fit gives a coordination number of 0.9 ± 0.2 for Pt–Br and 1.3 ± 0.3 for Pt–I. While the fitting of effective Pt–Pt path was not achieved, reconfirming the atomically dispersion of Pt species. Combining the DFT-optimized structure in Fig. 3h, the Pt atoms are mainly immobilized at the surface FA positions by coordinating with both Br and I atoms (for instance, with one Br atom and one I atom in the (100) plane, and with one Br atom and two I atoms in the (110) plane). Because the Pt loading does not depend on the crystal plane effect, all the exposed crystal planes of the perovskite can anchor Pt atoms (Fig. S8 and S9, ESI†), which brings the experimental fitting results of coordination number of ∼0.9 for Br and ∼1.3 for I derived from the overall effects of all the exposed crystal planes.


Photocatalytic HER performance. 
The Pt single atom immobilized on the perovskite support, which exhibits excellent semiconductor properties required by a good photocatalyst, is expected to exhibit superb HER performance. Thus, the activities of the Pt/FAPbBr3−xIx samples (100 mg) for the photocatalytic H2 evolution were examined in aqueous mixed HI/HBr acid saturated with FAPbBr3−xIx under simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2, AM1.5G), with a light irradiation area of π cm2. The original FAPbBr3−xIx without Pt loading were also tested under the same conditions for comparison. As shown in Fig. 4a, the pure FAPbBr3−xIx shows a mediocre photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of ∼39.8 μmol h−1, while the activity is drastically elevated after the atomically dispersed Pt is loaded onto the surface of the perovskite catalyst. As the loading amount of Pt continues to be optimized to 1.8%, the champion HER activity is determined to be 682.6 μmol h−1 (Video S1, ESI†). However, as the Pt amount further increases, the H2 evolution rate appears to decrease due to the aggregation of Pt atoms into Pt clusters, though large amounts of single Pt atoms still remain (Fig. 2g and h), maintaining the relatively high HER activity. To objectively evaluate the performance of the perovskite based single-atom photocatalyst, the solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (STH) is calculated based on the above-mentioned measurement condition to be 4.5%, which outperforms previously reported halide perovskite HER photocatalysts (Table S6, ESI†). Besides, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was determined through a band-pass filter of 530 nm to be 33.4% (Fig. S10, ESI†). And the activity dependence on light intensity and amount of catalyst was investigated (Fig. S11–S13, ESI†). All the results indicate that single Pt atoms immobilized on the perovskite allow maximizing the catalytic activity.

Besides the remarkable photocatalytic HER activity, stability is another essential factor to assess the photocatalyst. Thus, the long-term stability test for the halide perovskite supported Pt single-atom photocatalyst was performed. As shown in Fig. 4b, the Pt/FAPbBr3−xIx sample shows excellent stability without significant decay in the HER performance after 30 h of repeated tests (3 h for each cycle for 10 cycles). Some key characterization, including XRD, STEM-HAADF, SEM, XANES, EXAFS and XPS were performed after the stability measurement. The results in Fig. 4c and d and Fig. S14 (ESI†) indicate that the structure and morphology undergo negligible changes, and no aggregation of single Pt atoms is identified. In addition, the white line intensity (Fig. S15, ESI†) remains almost identical after the reaction, and the Pt–Br, Pt–I contributions located at ∼2.0 Å and ∼2.5 Å remain the only two prominent shells (Fig. S16, ESI†), where the typical Pt–Pt contribution at approximately 2.7 Å is absent. Moreover, the XPS spectra of Pt/FAPbBr3−xIx after the HER photocatalytic cycling measurement were collected and compared with those before the HER test. As shown in Fig. 4e–g and Fig. S17 (ESI†), all the peaks, i.e. Pb 4f, Br 3d, I 3d, Pt 4f (including the subpeaks), for the Pt/FAPbBr3−xIx sample show negligible changes both in the peak position and peak shape after the photocatalytic HER test. These results further confirm the stability of the Pt/FAPbBr3−xIx sample.


Charge carrier dynamics. 
Time-/space-resolved photoelectron generation and transfer on samples are studied using an advanced single-particle PL microscope. A single-particle PL image of FAPbBr3−xIx (Fig. 5a) shows three bright points with circle shapes, which are selected as the typical testing points afterwards. Drastically decreased brightness is observed on the PL image of Pt/FAPbBr3−xIx (Fig. 5), implying PL quenching. The single-particle PL spectra of FAPbBr3−xIx (Fig. 5b) corresponding to a1, a2 and a3 points in Fig. 5a exhibit a strong intensity of ∼10000–20000 (au) around 580 nm; in contrast, the Pt/FAPbBr3−xIx sample (Fig. 5e) has much weaker PL spectra obtained from three typical points (d1, d2, and d3) with an intensity of 600–900 (au), consistent with the quenching appearance observed in the particle PL images. The time-resolved PL spectra of the two particles of FAPbBr3−xIx and Pt/FAPbBr3−xIx are investigated as shown in Fig. 5c and f. The obvious difference in PL lifetimes is observed, and the average PL lifetime (τ) of FAPbBr3−xIx is calculated to be ∼104 ns, while the lifetime value decreases drastically to ∼0.44 ns for Pt/FAPbBr3−xIx (detailed fitting results are shown in Table S7, ESI†), implying that most excited electrons are trapped by anchored Pt species, which play vital roles in photocatalytic proton reduction. In addition, photo/electro-chemical measurements are applied to study the carrier dynamics. As shown in Fig. 5g, the Pt/FAPbBr3−xIx exhibits a significantly enhanced photocurrent than FAPbBr3−xIx. Furthermore, the Pt/FAPbBr3−xIx displays a much smaller semicircle in Nyquist plots shown in Fig. 5h. These results verify that atomically dispersed Pt could effectively facilitate charge separation and transfer in Pt/FAPbBr3−xIx, which contributes to an enhanced photocatalytic HER performance.

DFT calculations. 
Theoretical DFT calculations were conducted to further investigate the charge dynamics and explicate the catalytic process and mechanism. Fig. 6a displays the differential charge densities of the Pt/FAPbBr3−xIx sample and the corresponding local atom structure of the Pt–I/Br region. The results show that the loading of Pt causes an increased charge density around the Pt atom, which is consistent with the charge delocalizing from surrounding atoms (perovskite substrate) to Pt indicated by XPS analysis. This suggests that the immobilized Pt single-atoms are favourable to receive the photogenerated electrons and provide an improved electron environment for the catalytic HER. Moreover, as illustrated by the projected density of states (PDOS) of Pt/FAPbBr3−xIx in Fig. 6b, after the atomic loading of Pt atoms, orbital hybridization occurs distinctly between the introduced Pt and coordinated Br/I atoms, which is conducive to promote the charge transfer from the perovskite substrate to the Pt site, and consequently accelerate the following proton reduction process.
To further unravel the enhanced photocatalytic HER activity of Pt/FAPbBr3−xIx, the free energy (ΔGH*) for hydrogen adsorption was studied, which was generally regarded as the major descriptor for the HER catalyst. Based on the three main steps for the HER of (i) adsorption of a proton (H+) and its combination with e−, (ii) the formation of active intermediate H*, and (iii) the release of molecular hydrogen, it is commonly accepted that when the optimal value of ΔGH* is close to thermoneutral, i.e. ΔGH* ≈ 0, the catalyst is best for the HER.40,43 As shown in Fig. 6c, the ΔGH* of original FAPbBr3−xIx is deduced as 1.18 eV, which means that the material needs to overcome a large adsorption energy for hydrogen evolution. In contrast, the Pt single-atom immobilized on the perovskite substrate, as the active site for the HER, possesses a quite low adsorption energy of 0.04 eV, which is even lower than that of the bare Pt catalyst. Thus, as shown in the schematic diagram (Fig. 6d), the photocatalytic HER process involving the superior catalytic activity can be demonstrated that the perovskite supported Pt single-atoms act as the proton-acceptors for the recombination of the dissociated proton (H*) and HER sites due to its near-zero ΔGH* (0.04 eV) and strong electron reserve capacity deriving from locally enhanced charge distribution, leading to facilitated formation and release of molecular hydrogen.

Conclusions
In summary, we synthesized and characterized a novel photocatalyst that consisted of single Pt atoms uniformly dispersed on the FAPbBr3−xIx perovskite support by a facile self-adsorption and photoreduction method. The atomically dispersed Pt was correctly characterized and identified, implying that Pt single-atoms were immobilized at surface formamidinium cation sites coordinated with Br/I inions. This catalyst shows superb activity for photocatalytic H2 evolution from hydrogen halide splitting, corresponding to an outstanding STH of 4.50% under simulated sunlight irradiation. Time-/space-resolved photoelectron generation and transfer behavior were studied at a single-particle level using an advanced PL microscope, verifying that the anchored single Pt atoms could capture and trap photogenerated electrons from the perovskite substrate, and preserved for proton reduction during the photocatalysis process. This work not only proves the realization of noble metal single-atoms immobilized on an organometal halide perovskite substrate, but also provides a platform to develop more halide perovskite supported single-atom catalysts for wide applications in more fields.
Experimental
Synthesis of formamidinium bromide (FABr)
FABr was prepared from formamidine acetate (CH4N2·C2H4O2) and HBr solution. 10 g of formamidine acetate was added slowly to 14 mL of HBr acid (48 wt% in water) with vigorous stirring at 0 °C. After stirring for 2 h, the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation at 60 °C. The crude product was recrystallized with ethanol/diethyl ether, and washed with diethyl ether. The obtained white powders were dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 6 h.
Synthesis of FAPbBr3 and FAPbBr3−xIx and their saturated solutions
FAPbBr3 was precipitated from its saturated HBr acid solution. Specifically, excess FABr and PbBr2 were dissolved into HBr acid solution in a molar ratio of 1:1 with vigorous stirring; the orange FAPbBr3 powder and its saturated solution were obtained through centrifugation. Next, 8 mL of the obtained solution was mixed with 0.8 mL HI acid (57 wt% in water), and 2 mL hypophosphorous acid (H3PO2, 50 wt% in H2O) was added into this mixed HBr/HI acid to selectively reduce the I3− ions produced in the photocatalysis reaction to be carried out later. Next, excess FAPbBr3 powders were added into the mixed solution, and ultrasonic-stirring was performed to saturate the solution. Then excess powders were removed by centrifugation and the saturated mixed acid, which was preserved as the reaction solvent in the following stage, was obtained. Then 100 mg FAPbBr3 powders were added into the saturated acid solution, followed by another 20 min stirring to obtain the homogeneous mixture. The suspension was exposed to simulated sun light (100 mW cm−2) irradiation produced by a 300 W Xe lamp with an AM1.5G filter for 2 h, allowing the light-assisted halogen ion exchange reaction to proceed. The whole process was performed at 20 °C by using a cooling water system. The FAPbBr3−xIx sample was centrifuged, dried and preserved for further reaction and characterization.
Synthesis of Pt/FAPbBr3−xIx
The Pt/FAPbBr3−xIx photocatalysts were prepared using a self-adsorption and photoreduction strategy performed in the HBr/HI solution saturated with corresponding perovskite solutes. Specifically, a desired amount of chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6·6H2O) solution was dropped into the aforementioned saturated solution containing 100 mg FAPbBr3−xIx perovskite powders, vigorously stirred for 2 h, and then the suspension was exposed to light (AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) irradiation for another 2 h with constant stirring, using circulating cooling water to make the system temperature remain at 20 °C. Thus, an efficient single-atom photocatalyst was obtained, and the saturated solution with Pt/FAPbBr3−xIx was used for the HER measurement next.
Characterization
The crystal structures of the as-obtained products were characterized by XRD using a Rigaku MiniFlex 600 with Cu Kα radiation. The morphologies, microstructures and chemical composition of the samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Hitachi S-4800), TEM (JEOL JEM-2100F), and STEM (JEOL JEM-ARM200F). The Rietveld refinement of the X-Ray diffraction pattern was performed using FullProf Suite Toolbar 64-bits. HAADF-STEM experiments were performed using a JEOL JEM-ARM200F microscope equipped with a probe Cs corrector and a cold field emission gun, with a guaranteed resolution of 0.08nm, and the accelerating voltage was 200 kV. The STEM-EDS maps were acquired using a FEI Themis Z microscope equipped with a FEI Super-X™ detector system operated at 300 kV. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed using a Thermo Fisher scientific spectrometer with monochromatized Al Kα excitation, and C 1s (284.8 eV) was used to calibrate the peak positions of various elements. XANES and EXAFS measurements at the Pt L3-edge were recorded in transition mode at Beamline of TLS07A1 in the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC), Taiwan. Pt foil and H2PtCl6·6H2O were used as the reference samples. Data analysis was carried out with Athena and Artemis in the Demeter package. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) of the products were recorded using a Shimadzu UV 2600 spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere with 100% BaSO4 as a reflectance standard. The actual Pt loading amounts were characterized using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (Agilent, 5110 ICP-OES). Single-particle PL images and spectra of samples were recorded by using an objective scanning confocal microscope system (PicoQuant, MicroTime 200) coupled with an Olympus IX71 inverted fluorescence microscope. The samples were excited through a 405 nm laser, and the typical excitation powers for the PL measurements were 170 μW at the sample. All the experimental data were obtained at room temperature. Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed using an electrochemical analyzer in a standard three-electrode system in dichloromethane with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6), with the working electrode (FAPbBr3−xIx or Pt/FAPbBr3−xIx coated on FTO glass), a Pt foil counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode (KCl/sat’d). The photocurrent responses were measured by utilizing a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with an AM 1.5G filter (100 mW cm−2) as the light source at 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl reference.
Computational methods
In this work, spin-polarized density functional theory is performed for all calculations using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP). The ion-electron interactions are treated by the projector augmented wave (PAW) method. The exchange–correlation interactions are described by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the form of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional. The cut-off energy for the plane wave basis is set to be 500 eV. Brillouin zone integration is sampled with a Monkhorst–Pack grid of 3 × 3 × 6 for 2 × 2 × 1 supercell of FAPbBr3−xIx, a Monkhorst–Pack grid of 1 × 1 × 1 for 001 and 111 slabs during the structure optimization, and a Monkhorst–Pack grid of 7 × 7 × 1 for 001 and 111 slabs during the static state structure optimization. The convergence criteria for energy and force are set to be 10−5 eV and 0.01 eV A−1, respectively. The DFT-D2 method within the Grimme scheme is employed to describe the van der Waals (vdW) interaction. A vacuum larger than 20 Å is introduced to each side to avoid interactions between successive metal slabs.
Photocatalytic measurements
The photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of the perovskite supported single-atom catalyst in aqueous HBr/HI acid solution was carried out in a top irradiation vessel connected to a glass-enclosed gas circulation system. A 300 W Xe-lamp (CEL-HXF300, Beijing CEAULight, China) equipped with an AM1.5G filter was used as a visible light source, and the intensity was calibrated to be 100 mW cm−2 using an optical power meter (PL-MW2000, Beijing PerfectLight, China). The light irradiation area was π cm2. In a typical procedure, 100 mg of catalyst was added to 10 mL perovskite saturated solution (H3PO2 mixed) with constant stirring. The reaction temperature was maintained at 20 °C by circulating cool water. The amount of evolved H2 was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (ShiweipxGC-7806) with Ar as the carrier gas. The cycling photocatalytic test to investigate the stability of the photocatalyst was performed every 3 h as a cycle, when the system was re-evacuated.
The solar-to-chemical conversion efficiency, namely, the solar HI splitting efficiency in our photocatalytic system, is the ratio of solar light converted to break the chemical bonding of HI. It could be calculated by means of the standard redox potential of I− oxidation and the H+ reduction potential. The standard hydrogen reduction potential is 0 V (versus RHE), and the I− oxidation potential to I3− is 0.53 V (versus RHE). Based on the Nernst equation and the required ion concentration of H+ (8.80 mol L−1), I− (0.43 mol L−1), and I3− (4.78 × 10−5 mol L−1, Fig. S18, ESI†) in the current test solution, the cell potentials of E(2H+ + 2e− → H2), and E(3I− → I3− + 2e−) are calculated to be 0.056 V and 0.441 V versus NHE, respectively, thus the potential (E) for HI splitting in our test system is determined to be 0.385 V. The solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency, which is the HI splitting efficiency in the current photocatalytic system, could be estimated based on the amount of evolved hydrogen from the following equation:STH = [Evolved H2 (mol) × 6.02 × 1023 × 2 × 0.387 (eV) × 1.6 × 10−19]/[Psol (W cm−2) × Area (cm2) × time (s)] × 100
For instance, in the photocatalytic HI splitting process, 682.6 μmol H2 was generated in one hour under 100 mW cm−2 light irradiation, with the light irradiation area of π cm2, so the solar HI splitting efficiency is calculated as 4.50%.
The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was measured under the same photocatalytic reaction conditions with irradiation light through a band-pass filter of 530 nm. The photon flux of the incident light was determined using a PL-MW2000 spectroradiometer (PerfectLight, China). The apparent QE was calculated from the ratio of the number of reacted electrons during the hydrogen evolution to the number of incident photons by using the expression:

Broader context
To overcome the energy and resource crises, the development of efficient photocatalysts and photocatalytic systems for hydrogen production is urgent and necessary. Recently, organometal halide perovskite (OHP) has been developed for photocatalytic hydrohalic acid splitting. However, material modification methods are very limited and a satisfactory H2 evolution activity has not been obtained yet. In the present work, the FAPbBr3−xIx (FA = CH(NH2)2) OHP with supported Pt single-atoms is prepared as a photocatalyst for HI splitting, which shows a superb photocatalytic H2 evolution activity and an extraordinary STH (solar-to-hydrogen efficiency) of 4.50%. This work combines the advantages of the excellent properties of halide perovskites and the ultrahigh activity of single-atom catalysts, which could shed light on the design and development of halide perovskite-based sing-atom catalysis systems, and may be expected to put the catalytic reaction based on hydrohalic acid splitting a step forward to practical application.
