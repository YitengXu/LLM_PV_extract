    , Accepted 3rd January 2023First published on 5th January 2023AbstractIn this work, we report two vacancy ordered perovskites based on Cs2ReX6 (X – Cl, Br) for stable solar water oxidation. Instability of halide perovskites in aqueous media restricts their deployment in solar photoelectrochemical systems. The rhenium based VOPs reported in this work are shown to be highly stable in harsh pH media between pH1 and pH11 and show excellent visible and NIR absorption. The materials crystallize in the cubic phase similar to Cs2PtX6. The electrochemical stability window and flat band potential were determined for Cs2ReX6 and they were employed as photoanodes. Both these materials clearly show photocurrent under AM1.5G illumination and show excellent stability which is analysed by using chopped and continuous illumination.
Introduction
Storing solar energy in the form of chemical fuels is essential to solve the ever-increasing energy storage demand. Conventionally, a combination of photovoltaic devices and electrolyzers are used wherein the former converts sunlight into electricity and the latter utilizes the electricity to split water for hydrogen generation.1–7 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices can combine both light harvesting and water splitting in a single device, thereby reducing the complications of coupling multiple systems. State-of-the-art PEC devices employ semiconductors like Si and GaAs that show highly efficient photovoltaic power conversion efficiency (PCE).8–15 In the recent past, next generation materials based on halide perovskites have joined the high efficiency bandwagon with a PCE over 25%.16 These materials have excellent optoelectronic properties and shall potentially be employed in solar fuel applications. One of the downsides with the majority of the halide perovskite materials is that they decompose almost instantly in PEC electrolyte or under its operating conditions.17,18 However, by employing passivation/blocking layers on the surface of halide perovskites, their direct exposure to electrolyte is eliminated. This enabled these materials to be used as photoanodes or photocathodes in PEC devices. The device architecture in these devices follows a multilayer photovoltaic configuration with electron/hole transport layers for selective charge extraction and metal contacts. On top of these multilayer configurations, protection layers based on (i) InBiSn alloy (Field’s metal),19,20 (ii) metal foils including titanium and nickel,21,22 (iii) carbon materials,23 and (iv) atomic layer deposited oxides,24 were employed. Essentially all the selective charge extraction layers, metal contacts plus the additional protection layers act to prevent contact between perovskite and the electrolyte.
A similar strategy of protection was employed in the photocatalytic reaction for water reduction where CH3NH3PbI3 was coated with carbonized polymer dots and a platinum catalyst.25 However, the double perovskite materials with A2BB′X6 chemical formula are shown to be stable in the concentrated HX medium. It has to be noted that X in the material and the acid should be the same in order to ensure stability. Cs2AgBiBr6 was employed for water reduction in concentrated HBr, with surface coatings based on nitrogen doped carbon,26,27 or MoS2.28 Likewise, carbon dioxide photocatalytic reduction was carried out in Cs3Bi2I9 vacancy ordered triple perovskite materials wherein the reaction was carried out using humidified CO2, instead of the conventional way of dissolved CO2 in aqueous media to avoid material decomposition in the latter.29 In another report, CO2 reduction was carried out in aqueous media wherein Cs3Bi2I9 was protected with TiO2 and titanium foils, and hydrogenase enzymes were used as the catalyst.30 Among the ABX3 perovskites, a FAPbBr3 (FA – formamidinium) heterojunction with α-Fe2O3 was employed for CO2 reduction to CO and CH4. The reaction was carried out using humidified CO2, and the authors reported that the material decomposes if the perovskite is bought into direct contact within aqueous solution.31
On one hand, the conventional perovskite material ABX3 requires multiple protection layers if they have to be employed in the PEC/PC reaction. The double perovskites or vacancy ordered triple perovskites on the other hand, although partially stable in humidified media or in some limited acid media as mentioned in ref. 26–28, neither possess panchromatic visible light absorption nor complete stability in aqueous media. A material or a class of materials that can remain stable in aqueous media along with having good absorption properties would be ideal for next generation PEC devices. Recently, the vacancy ordered double perovskites based on A2B4+X6 have been reported to show high stability under harsh pH conditions coupled with having good absorption properties.32,33 Specifically the Cs2PtX6 family of compounds has been employed for PEC water oxidation where the materials possess panchromatic absorption covering over 700 nm (for bromide and iodide halides).34 Similar to platinum containing materials, the palladium containing compounds are also shown to be stable in aqueous media and demonstrated photocatalytic water splitting.35 In this work we report two rhenium compounds in the family of vacancy ordered perovskites, Cs2ReX6 (X – Cl, Br) that remain extremely stable under ambient and harsh pH conditions. These two materials Cs2ReCl6 (CReC) and Cs2ReBr6 (CReB), were synthesized using the hydrothermal method and their structural, thermal, optical, and electrochemical properties were explored. Their ability to act as photoanodes and perform solar water oxidation was investigated in detail.
Experimental section
Materials
Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO, TEC7-2.2 mm thick) was purchased from Great Cell Solar (Australia). Hydrochloric acid (HCl, min 35–37%) and iso-propanol (IPA, min 99%) were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Hydrobromic acid (HBr, ∼47% in water) and cesium chloride (CsCl, min 99.5%) were purchased from Spectrochem. Titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75 wt% in isopropanol) and rhenium(III) chloride (ReCl3) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Potassium chloride (KCl) was purchased from Emplura. Ethanol was procured from Changshu Hongsheng Fine Chemical. A Nafion-D-521 dispersion (5% w/w in water and 1-propanol) was purchased from Alfa Aesar.
Materials and device characterization
The absorption studies were conducted using a UV-VIS-NIR spectrometer (PerkinElmer LAMBDA 950) using a deuterium lamp (UV region) and tungsten–halogen lamp (VIS-NIR region) as light sources with PMT (UV-VIS region) and Peltier cooled PbS (NIR) as detectors. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) studies were performed on Hitachi S-4800 microscope fitted with a Quanta 200 FEG. The elemental mapping and composition were characterised using an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer from Oxford Instruments. The transmission electron microscopic (TEM) studies were carried out using Tecnai 20 operated at 200 kV. The samples for TEM were prepared by ultrasonicating the powder in ethanol, followed by dropping 10 μL of the dispersion on a copper grid. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was carried out using a Rigaku Supermini Flex 6G with Cu Kα as a radiation source with D/teX ultra 2 high-speed silicon-strip detectors. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic measurements were carried out using ATR-FTIR from Jasco Instruments (FT/IR-6600FV) where the measurements were taken under complete vacuum for far-infrared data acquisition. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted using an ULVAC-PHI (PHI5000 Version Probe III) instrument with an Al Kα source (1486.6 eV). The obtained XPS data were fitted using CASA XPS software and all spectra were calibrated using the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. The thermal stability of the samples was investigated using TG-DTA (SETARAM-LABSYS EVO) under the nitrogen atmosphere with the temperature range from room temperature (RT) to 1000 °C with a ramp of 10 °C min−1. For photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements, a solar simulator with an AM1.5G filter and 150 W xenon arc lamp (Sciencetech, Canada) were used. The intensity is adjusted to 100 mW cm−2 in order to match the AM1.5G conditions. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), chronoamperometry (CA), cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance measurements (EIS) and Mott–Schottky measurements were conducted using an Ametek Versastat-3 electrochemical workstation. The light chopping measurements were conducted using a homemade optical chopper controlled by using an Arduino microprocessor. The EIS data are fitted with an equivalent circuit (R1 + Q2/R2 + Q3/R3) using biologic EC-Lab software.
Synthesis of CReC and CReB powder
In the case of CReC, 2 mmol of CsCl and 1 mmol of ReCl3 were mixed in 3 mL of HCl, whereas in the case of CReB, the same stoichiometric proportions of CsCl and ReCl3 were mixed in 3 mL HBr. The corresponding mixtures were transferred to a Teflon lined hydrothermal reactor and heated at 170 °C for 48 hours in a hot air oven. After cooling down to room temperature, the materials were collected and washed with ethanol at least four times using a centrifuge followed by drying at 60 °C for 8 hours.
Photoanode fabrication
Before deposition of the as-synthesized CReC and CReB materials, FTO substrates were thoroughly cleaned by ultrasonicating with IPA for 20 minutes followed by DI water for 20 minutes. Further cleaning was performed by heating the FTO glasses on a high temperature hot plate at 500 °C for 30 minutes. A compact TiO2 (c-TiO2) layer was deposited by spray pyrolysis of 20 mL of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate)–ethanol mixture (1:39 volume ratio) onto the cleaned FTO substrate at 450 °C. This was followed by chemical bath deposition using 40 mM of TiCl4 solution in 150 mL DI water at 75 °C for 30 minutes. The substrates were washed with deionized water and IPA followed by treating the substrates at 500 °C for 30 minutes. For deposition on photoanode substrates, 15 mg of CReX (X = Cl− or Br−) powder was made into a dispersion by mixing with 180 μL of DI water, 200 μL of IPA and 20 μL of Nafion followed by ultra-sonication for one minute. Different volumes (50 μL, 100 μL and 150 μL) of the dispersion were drop-cast onto the substrates and deposited films were left undisturbed for ambient drying for 12 hours. Once the films were dried, the edges of the films were scrapped off leaving an active area of 5 × 5 mm2.
PEC device
The fabricated photo anode (FTO|c-TiO2|CReX (X = Cl− or Br−)) was used as the working electrode, Pt coil, as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl (3.5 M KCl Sat.) as the reference electrode and 0.05 M KCl as the supporting electrolyte. All the electrochemical and photoelectrochemical studies were performed using pH11 solution (1.5 mM KOH solution) at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) measurements were conducted with the frequency ranging from 1 MHz to 500 mHz at different applied voltage bias (0 V to 0.4 V).
Results and discussion
The synthesized products Cs2ReX6 (X – Cl, Br) were characterized using X-ray diffraction and the plots are shown in Fig. 1a. The diffraction patterns of both the chloride and bromide analogues were compared with the previously reported CIF data on Cs2ReCl6.36 The X-ray diffraction patterns of Cs2ReCl6 match with the literature data confirming the presence of the pure compound without any impurities. The crystal structure of Cs2ReBr6 is not reported; however, it can be noticed that the PXRD data of this compound match with those of Cs2ReCl6 indicating that both these materials crystallize in the same crystal structure. To further confirm the purity of the compounds, the XRD patterns were compared with that of another possible impurity phase, CsReCl4 (Fig. S1†).37 The simulated pattern of the latter compound is very different from that of the rhenium-based vacancy ordered perovskite confirming the absence of this most probable impurity. Similar to previous reports on Pt, Sn or Pd based compounds, based on the similarity in the PXRD patterns, the present materials can be assigned to the Fmm space group.34,38,39 The structure contains an isolated octahedron based on (ReX6)2− with Cs+ occupying the void spaces. Ideally, this crystal structure is similar to the ABX3 structure where two B sites with divalent charges are replaced by one tetravalent rhenium and a vacancy (Fig. 1b). Furthermore, to understand the vibrational properties, these materials were characterized using FT-far-IR spectroscopy and the data are shown in Fig. 1c. There are three distinct peaks in both the synthesized compounds. A typical octahedron is expected to have two vibration modes to be IR active, a stretching (s) peak between the central metal atom and corner halide ion at higher wavenumbers and a bending (b) between X–M–X at lower wavenumbers.40 In this work, Cs2ReCl6 showed a stretching peak at ∼300 cm−1 and a bending peak at 165 cm−1. For the bromide analogue, the peaks shifted to lower wavenumbers of 200 cm−1 (s) and 120 cm−1 (b) respectively. A similar observation of a shift in the wavenumber to lower values was reported in Cs2PtX6. In both the materials, broad peaks appear below 100 cm−1 and it can be attributed to the vibration of a complete octahedron.

These materials were further characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and the data are presented in Fig. S2.† The presence of the constituent elements Cs, Re and the halogens in these vacancy ordered perovskites is confirmed from the XPS spectra. The data were fitted, and except Cs, in Cs2ReBr6 all other spectra show two sets of peaks. This shall be attributed to the difference in the chemical environments of the atoms in the bulk and the surface. In the case of rhenium, the presence of mixed valency cannot be ruled out. However further detailed investigation is required to identify mixed valence states. The elemental analysis was also carried out by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and the data are shown Fig. S3.†
The stability of the materials was analysed under ambient conditions, in aqueous media, and at elevated temperatures. The as-synthesized sample was kept in ambient storage and the phase purity of the material was analysed using PXRD. Similarly, the pH stability was investigated by keeping the perovskite in the aqueous solutions of respective pH (pH1 and pH11) for 24 hours, followed by centrifuging and drying. The PXRD patterns in all these cases remain similar to those of the parent as-synthesized sample, which indicated the extraordinary stability of these materials (Fig. 1a). Among the halide perovskite materials, only Cs2PtX6 is reported to be stable under such harsh acidic and basic conditions. The well-known Cs2SnI6, however was shown to decompose into SnO2 instantly.32 This result indicates that Cs2ReX6 is one of the rare materials that remain ultra-stable in a highly corrosive environment. To elucidate the water stability of these perovskites, Jaroenjittichai et al.,41 investigated the interaction of Cs2(Ti, Zr, and Hf)X6 in water using the first principles study. The reaction pathway that was explored is given in eqn (1). Cs2(Ti, Zr, Hf)X6 + 2H2O → (Ti, Zr, Hf)O2 + 2CsX + 4HX(1)
The reaction energy was calculated by subtracting the energy of products from the reactants. The negative value of reaction energy implies that the reaction will be spontaneous. However, reaction energy was found to be positive for Cs2(Ti, Zr, and Hf)X6 indicating that these materials show excellent stability in water. A similar theory shall be applied for Cs2ReX6 materials; however, further detailed theoretical investigation is required.
To understand the thermal stability of these materials, thermogravimetric analysis under N2 environment was carried out (Fig. 1d). Both these materials show thermal resistance up to around 600 °C with single-step and two-step decomposition which was observed for chloride- and bromide-based compounds, respectively. The expected pathway is the release of 2X2 leaving 2CsX and Re. At elevated temperatures, CsX sublimes possibly leaving the Re residues.
The optical properties were investigated by absorption spectroscopy and the plot is shown in Fig. 2a. Three distinct features can be observed from the spectra, (i) a steep visible absorption signature, (ii) two small signatures in the red region and (iii) two peaks in the IR wavelengths. In a typical A2BX6 vacancy ordered perovskite structure, the top of the valence band is predominantly formed by the orbitals of halogen and bottom of the conduction band is formed by metal (B-site) orbitals. The optical transition is then anticipated between the halogen (ligand) and metal orbitals upon light illumination. Taking the case of Cs2PtX6, Pt is present in the 4+ state with a 5d6 valence shell. As Pt is present in the octahedral environment with halide ligands, the three t2g orbitals are expected to be at lower energy and two eg orbitals at higher energy, with the former completely filled with six electrons and latter is completely empty. The tetravalent rhenium in this material has a 5d3 valence state, with t2g partially filled and eg empty. This essentially means the optical transition can happen from ligand valence orbitals to either partially filled t2g or empty eg states. Based on the absorption spectra, we believe that t2g possesses non-degenerate states possibly in two energy levels and this scenario has been reported in the past for rhenium and osmium compounds.42–45 The probable band structure is provided in Fig. 2b. The low wavelength visible absorption onset can be assigned to the transition between halide p-orbitals and the empty metal eg states (labelled as LMCT1). The two red absorption peaks are expected to arise from the halide p-orbitals to non-degenerate t2g orbitals (labelled as LMCT2). Finally, the transition in the IR region can be attributed to the transitions between t2g and eg levels (labelled d–d). It has to be noted that the LMCT onset is observed at a lower wavelength for Cs2ReCl6 (500 nm) compared to Cs2ReBr6 (600 nm) and it is due to the fact that chloride valence states are positioned lower compared to bromide orbitals. This observation is prevalent even in conventional ABX3 perovskites where CH3NH3PbCl3 has a higher LMCT gap compared to CH3NH3PbBr3.46 So, as expected in Cs2ReX6, the LMCT1 optical gap is higher for the chloride compound. A similar difference can also be observed in LMCT2. The Cs2ReCl6 powder appear yellow whereas the Cs2ReBr6 powder looks orangish brown. Although the LMCT2 and d–d absorption appear in red and NIR regions, respectively, the material does not appear black possibly due to a very low absorption (or molar-extinction) coefficient due to these transitions. Both these materials show weak photoluminescence emission between 400 and 550 nm possibly due to the radiative transition between t2g of Re and p orbitals of halide (Fig. 2c). Upon excitation, the electrons move from the valence band to empty eg states; however, they quench back to low energy t2g states immediately. The radiative emission of electrons to the valence band happens from the low energy t2g states. Although the LMCT1 onset (in the absorption spectra) is different for Cs2ReCl6 and Cs2ReBr6, the LMCT2 absorption peaks remain nearly at similar wavelengths. This indicates that the difference in the energy gap between the valence band and t2g might be similar for both the materials, leading to emission in the same wavelength range.

(b) Representative band structure, (c) photoluminescence spectra under 370 nm illumination, and (d) Mott–Schottky plot at pH11. The intercept in the x-axis shows the flat band potential, (e) band positions of CReC and CReB, and (f) cyclic-voltammogram taken in pH11 solution, at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. The inset shows the zoomed-in data between 0 and 1.5 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). 
The morphology of materials was investigated using electron microscopic techniques and the micrographs are shown in Fig. 2a (SEM) and S4† (TEM). The hydrothermally synthesized materials show large particles of a few microns, and also contain some small particles of the order of few tens of nanometers.
As these materials are stable in acidic and basic aqueous media and possess panchromatic light absorption, they are suited for application in photoelectrochemical water splitting, provided they remain electrochemically stable in the electrolyte and possess appropriate band positions. To find the conduction band position, the flat band potential (EFB) was estimated using the Mott–Schottky method.47 The electrochemical impedance spectra were taken in the range of 0 to 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl at a frequency of 100 Hz in pH11 solution and the plot of 1/C2 as a function of applied bias is given in Fig. 2d. The EFB (voltage at 1/C2 = 0) for Cs2ReCl6 and Cs2ReBr6 is found to be −0.26 V and −0.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), respectively. As expected, the difference between the EFB of these two materials is small because the conduction band is formed by rhenium orbitals. However, using the LMCT1 wavelength onset, the valence band position was estimated, and the plot is shown in Fig. 2e. It can be noticed that the valence band of the chloride-based compound is positioned lower than that of the bromide-based material. This is due to the low-lying chloride p-orbitals. The positive slope indicates that the material is n-type conducting. The position of the valence band is below the water oxidation potential, and also, both these materials are n-type, and hence they can be used as photoanodes for solar water oxidation.
To further check the electrochemical stability of these materials, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was studied in pH 11 solution with KCl as the supporting electrolyte. The materials were independently coated on FTO glasses and used as the working electrode. Upon scanning on the oxidation side from 0 V to 1.5 V, no oxidation currents were observed for both the materials up to 1 V. However, beyond 1 V, oxidation signatures could be observed. On scanning back from 1.5 V to −1.5 V no reduction currents were noticed up to ∼−0.1 V but below this potential steep multistep reduction processes were observed. CV was completed by scanning the potential back to 0 V. The oxidation current observed can be attributed to water oxidation and reduction could be due to the reduction of Re4+/Re3+ down to lower oxidation states. As the material possesses high oxidative stability, these materials are highly suitable for solar water oxidation.
Photoelectrochemical solar water oxidation was carried out in a cappuccino cell with CReX coated on TiO2-coated-FTO as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl (3.5 M KCl) as the reference electrode, and Pt counter electrode in a pH11 solution containing KCl as the supporting electrolyte.48 The linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) were recorded in the dark and under AM1.5G solar illumination conditions. Fig. 3a and d show the data for films made from 100 μL solution and it can be noticed that in both the chloride and bromide materials, there is a clear difference between the dark and the light currents. A photocurrent density of around 0.15–0.20 mA cm−2 was observed at 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl (approx., 1.23 V vs. RHE). It has to be noted that no clear onset on photopotential could be observed in the LSV. From the cyclic voltammogram shown in Fig. 2f, reduction current is observed just below 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl due to the reduction of a tetravalent rhenium cation to it’s low oxidation states. So to avoid material decomposition, a lower limit of voltage in water oxidation experiments was set to 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The blank experiment without an absorber layer does not not show any appreciable photocurrent under AM1.5G illumination (Fig. S5†).
 Fig. 3  (a and d) Linear sweep voltammogram in the dark (dotted line) and under AM1.5G illumination (solid line). (b and e) Chronoamperometry data at 0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) under chopped and continuous illumination. (c and f) Nyquist plots at 0.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). in the dark (solid line) and under illumination (dotted line). The red plots correspond to CReC and blue plots correspond to CReB. 
To make sure that the appeared current under illumination does not arise from photocorrosion, stability measurements under a combination of chopped (300 seconds)-continuous (∼6500 seconds)-chopped (300 seconds) light illumination were carried out. The chronoamperometric study was performed under this illumination protocol at a potential of 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Under the chopped light scenario, as the shutter is turned on, the photocurrent reached ∼0.14 mA cm−2 (for Cs2ReCl6) and 0.20 mA cm−2 (for Cs2ReBr6). The current density remains constant; however, upon closing the shutter, the current immediately dropped to zero. This clearly indicates that current observed under illumination in LSV arises due to the photocurrent and rules out any photocorrosion of the semiconductor. The stable photocurrent under continuous illumination for over two hours followed by chopped illumination further confirm the long-term PEC oxidative stability of these materials. To understand the effect of thickness, different volumes (50 μL, 100 μL and 150 μL) of the dispersion were drop-cast on photoelectrodes and their corresponding cross-sectional SEM micrographs are provided in Fig. S6.† As the volume of the dispersion used for drop-casting the films were varied between 50 and 150 μL, the thickness of the films increases from 3 μm to 7.5 μm and 1.2 μm to 6.5 μm for Cs2ReCl6 and Cs2ReBr6, respectively. The corresponding LSV curves under AM1.5G illumination are provided in Fig. S7.† For chloride based material, the 150 μL film gave high photocurrent, whereas for the bromide compound, the 100 μL film yielded the best photoresponse.
To understand the charge transfer resistance properties, electrochemical impedance measurements were carried out in the dark and under illumination and the Nyquist plots at 0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl are shown in Fig. 3c and f. The spectra are fitted with an equivalent electrical circuit and two distinct observations could be made: (i) under illumination the RCT value is decreasing, and it is due to the transfer of photogenerated holes from the valence band of the absorber to the electrolyte, and (ii) Cs2ReBr6 shows low resistance to charge transfer to Cs2ReCl6. The slightly higher photocurrent observed with bromide-based materials can be attributed to its low RCT values.
Conclusions
Thus, in this work, two highly stable vacancy-ordered halide perovskites based on Cs2ReX6 have been synthesized and their materials, electrochemical and photoelectrochemical properties were investigated. These materials crystallize in a cubic structure similar to that of the previously reported Cs2PtI6. Unlike conventional halide perovskites, rhenium-based materials remain incredibly stable in harsh environments including highly acidic and basic pH media. Along with the stability, they show panchromatic light absorption covering the entire visible region. The band positions, electrochemical stability and nature of conductivity made them an appropriate photoanode material for solar water oxidation in alkaline media. These photoanodes show clear light dependent current in a photoelectrochemical system, and chopped light measurements confirm the stability of the material. The combination of high stability and excellent optical properties makes these materials suitable for next generation solar water splitting devices.
