    , Accepted 23rd September 2016First published on 23rd September 2016AbstractA critical requirement of small molecule non-fullerene acceptor-based solar cells for efficient charge separation and collection is the formation of interconnected phase-separated domains of 10–20 nm. The phase-separation behavior of small molecule donor 7,7′-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(6-fluoro-4-(5′-hexyl-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole) (p-DTS(FBTTh2)2) and acceptor N,N′-bis(1-ethylpropyl)-perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide (EP-PDI) was regulated by donor selective solvent vapor annealing (D-SVA), poor donor solvent vapor annealing (P-SVA) and thermal annealing (TA). It was found that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) was significantly improved from less than 0.2% up to 3.0% after D-SVA. In contrast, a limited improvement of PCE was obtained for P-SVA (1.9%) and TA (1.8%). The difference in the improvement of PCE values was attributed to the formation of a phase-separated structure and the regulation of crystallite sizes under different post treatments. The fibrous crystals of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 were formed during D-SVA treatment while the EP-PDI component was in the form of small microcrystals, thus leading to the required interconnected phase-separated structure. As a consequence, the moderate phase-separated morphology accompanied by a pure crystalline phase with a medium size could maximize the carrier transport process without compromising exciton separation efficiency, and thus contributes to the final optimal PCE value of up to 3.0% under D-SVA. For P-SVA or TA treatment, we only observed a significant enhancement of the crystallinity of both p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and EP-PDI components, leading to remarkable film coarsening, or even undesired large phase separation, which is detrimental to the exciton diffusion as well as exciton separation processes.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have gained increasing attention over recent years and solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) devices have been fabricated with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 10%.1,2 Driven by the continuous need to improve PCEs, a large variety of new OPV semiconductors including electron donating components, fullerene as well as non-fullerene electron accepting counterparts have been developed and characterized.3–11 It is well known that the nano-to-mesoscale morphologies of active layers are critical for the final performance of OPV devices, particularly, the degree of phase separation between donor and acceptor components which evolves either spontaneously or is induced by varying film-processing conditions. In addition to bi-continuous pure donor and acceptor phases, an amorphous, intermixed phase was also recently found to play a critical role in exciton quenching and free charge generation.12–14 After charge separation, free electrons and holes are transported to respective electrodes through a bi-continuous donor–acceptor charge transporting percolated network. Hence, the performance of many OPVs is always a compromise in the tradeoff between exciton separation and carrier transport.12,15
Among various efficient OPV systems, small molecule non-fullerene acceptor-based solar cells have also been progressively improved over the past few years and there have been a few reports of non-fullerene based OPVs achieving PCEs exceeding 10%.16–21 The low-cost perylene diimide (PDI) derivative commercial dyes are some of the most widely-used small molecule non-fullerene materials. Similar to traditional fullerene-based blend systems, the regulation of film microstructures is equally crucial for PDI-based non-fullerene systems. Due to the different miscibilities between various donor and PDI acceptor materials, either a finely intermixed microstructure or a large phase separation morphology induced by the formation of micrometer-sized PDI crystals appears in PDI-based blend systems.22,23 Therefore, the film morphology of the PDI-based systems is always far from satisfactory for the nano-structure of optimal devices. Besides, although the exciton lifetimes and diffusion lengths are generally believed to be much larger in many PDIs, stabilized excimers are rapidly formed (with a slower diffusion rate), especially in H-aggregated PDI systems, and act as charge traps for excitation energy.24,25 For all the factors discussed above, the phase separation morphology of the PDI-based systems needs to be carefully controlled, thus reducing charge recombination efficiency and maximizing PCE contributions benefiting from both donor and acceptor components.
In the case of finely mixed PDI-based OPVs, the enhancement of local orders and the reconstruction of pure crystalline domains are of fundamental importance for the transport of free electrons and holes. Therefore, various traditional film-processing conditions including the incorporation of solvent additives,26–28 thermal annealing (TA)29,30 and solvent vapor annealing (SVA)17,31 have been applied to optimize the essential ordered microstructures of PDI-based systems. The 7,7′-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(6-fluoro-4-(5′-hexyl-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole) (p-DTS(FBTTh2)2) and N,N′-bis(1-ethylpropyl)-perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide (EP-PDI) blend system is one of the representatives of finely mixed non-fullerene systems, in which isolated EP-PDI molecules serve as charge traps and induced severe charge recombination. Introduction of additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) has been proved to be efficient at increasing the solid state order of both p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and PDI, thus leading to a significant improvement of charge transport efficiency.26,32,33 Although the degree of molecular order for both donor and acceptor materials can be significantly enhanced via regulating the reorganization processes, the control of the crystalline domain size, especially the domain size of the EP-PDI component is less of a concern in the PDI-based system.
In this work, we provide insights into microstructure evolution for the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/EP-PDI system under different post-treatments (including donor selective solvent vapor annealing (D-SVA), the solvent vapor atmosphere with poor donor solubility (P-SVA) and thermal annealing (TA)). The device performance was found to be significantly improved from less than 0.2% up to 3.0% after D-SVA. However, under the conditions of the P-SVA and TA treatments, the PCE values only increased to 1.9% and 1.8%, respectively. Judging from the morphological characterization, it can be seen that both p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and EP-PDI components existed in the form of small microcrystals and thus the required interconnected phase-separated structure was generated during D-SVA. Moderate phase separation manipulated by D-SVA achieved balanced exciton separation and carrier transport. As for the latter two treatment conditions, significantly enhanced crystallinity for both components could only lead to unexpected large crystalline domains, in which EP-PDI stabilized excimers form, and thus are adverse to the exciton separation process.

Device fabrication and testing
Organic solar cells were fabricated on indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates pre-treated with water, acetone and isopropanol in an ultrasonic bath followed by cleaning for 25 min with UV ozone. A poly(ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) layer with a thickness of 25 nm was spin-coated on well-cleaned ITO substrates and dried at 140 °C in a vacuum for 30 min. p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:EP-PDI (1:1 w/w, 30 mg mL−1) solution was heated for 12 hours and cast at 80 °C to produce films with a thickness of around 100 nm in a glovebox. To achieve SVA, the spin-coated films were exposed to a certain solvent saturated atmosphere for certain times. To achieve TA, the spin-coated film was annealed in a N2-filled glove box at 120 °C for certain times. Finally, a bilayer structure of Ca (5 nm)/Al (90 nm) was deposited on top of the active layer by thermal evaporation in a vacuum of 2 × 10−4 Pa to complete device fabrication. Four solar cells, each with an active area of 12 mm2, were fabricated per ITO glass substrate.
Characterization
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was measured using a TA DSC Q2000. DSC was conducted under nitrogen at the heating and cooling rates of 5 °C min−1. Pure p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, pure EP-PDI and p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:EP-PDI blend (1:1 w/w) samples were measured in four heating/cooling cycles. p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:EP-PDI (1:1 w/w) drop-cast films post-treated under different conditions were measured in one heating cycle.
UV-vis absorption spectra of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, EP-PDI and p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:EP-PDI blend solutions and solid-state UV-vis absorption spectra of the blend films were recorded using a Lambda 750 spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, MA). The fluorescence spectra of the pure and blend films were recorded using a Jobin Yvon LabRAM HR spectrometer (A 532 nm solid-state laser was chosen as an excitation light source).
The crystallinity of the active layer was characterized by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) and in-plane X-ray diffraction (IPXRD). GIXD patterns were measured using a diffractometer D8 Discover (Bruker, Germany) (λ = 1.54 Å). A fixed grazing incidence angle of 0.2° was used to reduce the scattering from the substrates. IPXRD patterns were obtained by using a Rigaku SmartLab instrument with an X-ray generation power of 40 kV tube voltage and 30 mA tube current. The diffraction was recorded in the 2q-ξ mode. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were obtained using a JEOL JEM-1011 transmission electron microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV.
The morphology of the active layer was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atom force microscopy (AFM). TEM experiments were performed on a TEM-1011 (JEOL Co., Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. AFM experiments were carried out using a Veeco Instruments Nanoscope in tapping mode. A silicon microcantilever (a spring constant of 2 N m−1 and a resonant frequency of ≈70 kHz, Olympus, Japan) was used for scanning.
Current density–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the organic solar cells were measured using a computer controlled Keithley 236 source meter under AM1.5G illumination from a calibrated solar simulator with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the OPV cells was measured using a QE-R3011 (Enli Technology Co., Ltd) with a lock-in amplifier at a chopping frequency of 280 Hz, the monochromatic light was obtained from a xenon lamp.
Results and discussion
Effects of annealing treatments on the photovoltaic characteristics
SVA and TA have been commonly used to improve the order of organic blend films. Considering that various solvent vapors can make a difference in the reorganization processes of both donor and acceptor molecules, chlorobenzene (CB), o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) and ethyl acetate (EA) are chosen to make a comparison. The blend films annealed by solvent vapors of CB, ODCB and EA are denoted as CB-SVA, ODCB-SVA and EA-SVA, respectively. EP-PDI molecules exhibit limited solubility in all of the three kinds of solvents mentioned above. It should be noted that CB and ODCB are good solvents for p-DTS(FBTTh2)2. Nevertheless, p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 exhibits poor solubility in EA (Fig. S1, ESI†). Based on this difference, CB-SVA and ODCB-SVA are collectively denoted D-SVA (i.e. donor selective SVA), and EA-SVA could also be denoted P-SVA (i.e. solvent vapor with poor donor solubility).

Fig. 1(a) displays the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:EP-PDI BHJ OPV devices for as-deposited and annealed films under simulated AM1.5 sun illumination. The as-deposited device exhibits extremely low photovoltaic performance with a VOC of 0.68 V, a JSC of 0.39 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.40, and a PCE of 0.11%. The low JSC value can be attributed to the structurally disordered BHJ morphology lacking charge transport channels. After TA treatment, the JSC value enhanced remarkably to 5.23 mA cm−2, resulting in an efficiency of approximately 1.82%. Intriguingly, the CB-SVA treated device exhibited even more excellent performance with a VOC of 0.76 V, a JSC of 6.75 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.59 and a PCE of 3.02%. Moreover, the ODCB-SVA and EA-SVA treated devices also achieved optimized performance with PCEs of 2.72% and 1.92%, respectively. The detailed information is listed in Table 1. According to the results of device performance, the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:EP-PDI system achieved the greatest degree of improvement under D-SVA (i.e., CB-SVA and ODCB-SVA).

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements of the as-deposited, SVA and TA treated devices are plotted in Fig. 1(b). As previously reported, the EQE value of the as-deposited device is less than 7%.32 While the EQE value of the post-treated devices prominently improved in the wavelength ranging from 450 nm to 700 nm, which overlaps with the optical absorption spectra of both p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and EP-PDI. Similar to the photovoltaic performance, the EQE values achieved most notable enhancement after D-SVA treatment. In order to further illustrate the positive effects of post-treatment on the device performance, the differential EQE value between SVA-treated device and TA-treated device is plotted in Fig. 1(c). Compared with TA treatment, SVA, especially D-SVA contributes to the significant enhancement of photon absorption efficiency in the spectral range of the EP-PDI component. The interpretation for the optimization of device performance under different post-treatments will be discussed in the following section.
Morphology characteristics under different post-treatments
Prior to attempting to control the microstructures of the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/EP-PDI blend system, we investigated the compatibility between donor and acceptor molecules. According to the DSC curves and the XRD results, it was found that two materials exhibited good compatibility. Then, we attempt to construct nanoscale phase separation of the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/EP-PDI system via various post-treatment methods. Due to the inherent strong π–π interactions, the molecular order of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and EP-PDI was readily attained after SVA and TA treatments. Even though, there are great differences in the degree of phase separation and the crystallite size under various annealing conditions.
According to the molecular architecture of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and EP-PDI, it is plausible that flat molecular structures would readily induce strong π-stacking interactions. DSC curves (as shown in Fig. 2(a)) represent the thermal behaviors of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and EP-PDI, both of which reveal sharp phase transition peaks with a large area. Taking the second heating process as an example, the melting temperature of pure p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 appears at 208.9 °C, followed by a sharp endothermic peak with an enthalpy (ΔH) of 56.2 J g−1. For pure EP-PDI, the single endothermic peak with ΔH of 12.2 J g−1 is observed at 73.0 °C. As regards the blends with a weight ratio of 1:1, the coexistence of two separated phase transition peaks for both p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and EP-PDI can be seen. However, both the melting peak of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and the solid–solid phase transition peak of EP-PDI in the blends become weak significantly (ΔH values are 26.7 J g−1 and 4.2 J g−1, respectively). Meanwhile, the endothermic peak of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 shifts to lower temperatures (appears at 206.5 °C during the second heating procedure). The good compatibility is considered to be responsible for the decrease of phase transition temperature (as well as the decreased ΔH values).34 1D out-of-plane GIXD patterns of blend films with different weight ratios were measured to further demonstrate the effect of compatibility on the control of phase separation (Fig. 2(b)). The sole diffraction peak of the (011) plane is observed in the pure p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 film.35 With the increase of the EP-PDI content, the (011) peak shifts towards a smaller angle and the diffraction density weakens prominently. The weakened crystallinity of each component further demonstrates the good mixing between p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and EP-PDI. It is worth mentioning that the diffraction peak has become extremely weak under the optimal experimental conditions for constructing OPV devices (with a weight ratio of 1:1), which implies that amorphous intermixed phases for two components exist in the blend film.27 This also provides the explanation for the low photovoltaic performance of the as-deposited film.

To form a bi-continuous network, ordered donor and acceptor domains should be constructed. Since the shape of the studied blend absorption spectrum is strongly dependent on the nature of the respective molecular packing, UV-vis spectra shown in Fig. 3 could readily verify the positive effect of post-treatments on film crystallinity (the absorption profiles of pure p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and EP-PDI thin films were supplied in Fig. S2, ESI†). After post-treatment, the appearance of a vibronic structure at 678 nm indicates the formation of ordered aggregates for p-DTS(FBTTh2)2.23,36 Meanwhile, the weakened absorption bands corresponding to 0–0, 0–1 and 0–2 transitions (at 536, 495 and 466 nm, respectively) of the EP-PDI molecules and the emergence of a low-energy absorption band at around 590 nm are observed upon annealing, which are assigned to the formation of well-ordered EP-PDI aggregates.23,36,37 To further illustrate the effect of annealing on the self-assembly of both components, GIXD patterns were used to characterize the crytallinity of the post-treated films. As shown in Fig. 4, the (001) peak of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 was enhanced remarkably, alongside the appearance of a prominent (200) diffraction peak corresponding to the EP-PDI component upon EA-SVA and TA treatments. Nevertheless, in the case of D-SVA (i.e., CB-SVA and ODCB-SVA), merely the (001) peak of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 was reflected in the GIXD patterns. According to the UV-vis spectra and GIXD results, we believe that the molecular order of both components can be efficiently improved by various post-treatments. However, it seems that both TA and P-SVA treatments are ready to induce large crystalline domains for both components, which will not occur under D-SVA treatment.

To obtain quantitative insights into the crystallite size along the intermolecular packing direction, the π–π stacking of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and EP-PDI upon annealing was characterized by in-plane XRD (Fig. 5), which exhibits gradually enhanced intensity with the extended post-annealing time. To get quantitative information on the effect of post-annealing, the sizes of the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and EP-PDI crystallites along the π–π stacking directions under different post-treatment conditions were calculated using Scherrer eqn (1):38,39 (1)where λ and β are the wavelength of the incident X-ray beam (0.154 nm) and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the in-plane peaks at 2θ = 24.48° and 25.77°, respectively. The evolution of crystal sizes with respect to the intermolecular π–π ordering along the substrate surface could reflect the difference of crystallization kinetics under different conditions, as shown in Fig. 5(c and d). Due to the extremely weak π–π stacking intensity in-plane, the crystallite size in the pristine blend film was not calculated using this method. It is noteworthy that the size of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystallites was gradually enhanced with respect to either annealing method, whereas different crystallite sizes formed with increasing annealing time. Fig. 5(c) displays that the intermolecular π–π crystallite sizes of both components generally maintain around 7–10 nm with a prolonging CB-SVA time. Nevertheless, the TA-treated films exhibited enlarged crystallites with a crystal size between 10 nm and 13 nm (as shown in Fig. 5(d)). This result indicates that D-SVA post-treatment could realize the regulation of BHJ phase separation while forming adequate pure crystalline phases. As regards TA treatment, crystallization processes of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and EP-PDI induced the formation of larger crystallites and larger phase separation.

Then the morphologies of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:EP-PDI blend films before and after post-treatments were characterized by TEM and AFM height images, as shown in Fig. 6. Compared with the uniform structure of the as deposited film (with the film roughness less than 1 nm), the roughness of the post-treated films increased remarkably. In particular, the roughness of the EA-SVA treated and TA treated films increased to more than 10 nm. Though various treatment conditions could promote the formation of pure crystalline phases, the TA method induced large scale phase separation with no less than hundreds of nanometers (Fig. 6(e)), which did not happen for SVA (Fig. 6(b)–(d)).

To further represent the extent of phase separation, the fluorescence spectra (Fig. 7) were recorded for both pure and blend films. Due to the limited exciton diffusion length of most organic semiconductors (usually approximately 5–10 nm),40–42 the degree of fluorescence quenching in the blend will be sensitive to the subtle variations in the film microstructure occurring on a similar length scale. Herein for pristine p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/EP-PDI blend films (Fig. 7(b)), the fluorescence appears to be significantly quenched, which is indicative of intimate mixing of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and EP-PDI at a molecular level. When the film was treated by various solvent vapors, a strong fluorescence peak appears at around 620 nm, which demonstrates the formation of a pure EP-PDI phase. In sharp contrast, simultaneously observed are the fluorescence signals of both EP-PDI and p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 components upon TA treatment. Considering the comparatively low fluorescence intensity of the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 component (Fig. 7(a)), the appearance of a p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 fluorescence signal in the blend film indicates the formation of enhanced phase separation with a prominent p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystalline phase, which is consistent with the morphology coarsening confirmed by TEM and AFM height images. It should be noted that the P-SVA treated film did not exhibit hundreds of nanoscale phase separation, though the roughness of the corresponding film enhanced remarkably (Fig. 6(d′)). It is speculated that the minor impact of EA vapor on p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 impeded the formation of a large donor crystal. Even though, the formation of a large acceptor crystallite would also induce significant film coarsening with the film roughness no less than 10 nm, as shown in Fig. 6(d′). To sum up, TA treatment leads to the formation of large donor crystallites and P-SVA leads to the formation of large acceptor crystallites. Both the conditions mentioned above thus induced most apparent film coarsening. Only after D-SVA treatment we can construct a bi-continuous network structure with a small crystallite size in the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/EP-PDI system.

Interpretation of the morphological difference under different post-treatments
In order to investigate the effect of post-treatment conditions on the phase-separated morphology, ex situ GIXD was adopted to characterize the film properties upon different annealing times. Fig. 8(a) and (b) are the evolutions of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and EP-PDI diffraction peaks of out-of-plane lattice planes for p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:EP-PDI blend films under CB-SVA and TA treatments. As mentioned above, the formation of a crystalline microstructure in pristine blend films is hampered since two components have been brought into an intimately mixed state. When the pristine film experienced CB solvent vapor for 1 s, the (200) peak of EP-PDI sharpened and distinctly shifted from 2θ = 5.14° to 5.52°. With the CB-SVA time prolonged, the intensity of the (200) peak weakened remarkably and this diffraction peak successively shifted back to 5.14°. Meanwhile, the (001) peak of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 became stronger gradually. To further illustrate the effect of particular solvent vapor on the molecular orientation of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:EP-PDI blends, polystyrene (PS):EP-PDI blends and pure EP-PDI films were applied to an identical solvent vapor atmosphere as a contrast experiment (Fig. 8(c) and (d)). It is found that CB-SVA treatment has little impact on the molecular packings of EP-PDI side chains in phase-separated PS:EP-PDI blends. As for pure EP-PDI films, the enhanced (002) diffraction peak and the decreased d-spacing (the value of 2θ increases from 8.71° to 9.23°) indicate that the CB vapor atmosphere is capable of strengthening the EP-PDI solid state order. A similar phenomenon was also observed for p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:EP-PDI blends at the initial stage of CB-SVA. However, the weakened peak intensity of EP-PDI appears only for p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:EP-PDI blends upon prolonging the annealing time, suggesting that the solvation effect plays a critical role in the formation of small microcrystals over post-treatment time. Similar characterization was also adopted for TA-treated films (Fig. 8(b)). With the increase of the TA time, the intensity of the (200) peak for EP-PDI only reduced slightly, followed by the increased (001) peak intensity of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2. These results show that TA treatment could facilitate the crystallinity of both components, thus leading to large phase separation.

To illustrate the impact of the solvent vapor properties, ex situ GIXD under ODCB and EA solvent vapors were also investigated as a contrast (Fig. S3, ESI†). Since both CB and ODCB are good solvents for p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, similar evolution of corresponding diffraction peaks was observed after ODCB-SVA. Nevertheless, the (200) peak of EP-PDI did not decrease significantly under EA-SVA. As mentioned above, the EA solvent exhibits a minor effect on p-DTS(FBTTh2)2. Therefore, unaffected by p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, the EP-PDI component tends to accomplish the reorganization processes efficiently under an EA atmosphere, thus obtaining large acceptor crystallites.
The morphological characteristics and device performance results indicate that the bi-continuous network structure induced by D-SVA not only supplied essential charge transport channels, but also maintained required interfaces of donor and acceptor materials, therefore achieving a maximum improvement in the final PCE values. The hole mobility in the as-deposited device was measured to be as low as 5.2 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, as determined by J–V characteristics of the hole-only device (Fig. S4, ESI†). From the morphology characteristics of the as-deposited films, it can be seen that the lack of pure crystalline phases suppresses the transport process of free charge being able to percolate into its preferential phase. Post-treatments facilitate the formation of pure crystalline phases of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and EP-PDI, which supply efficient charge transport channels for both holes and electrons. The hole mobilities of the samples after CB-SVA and TA treatments reached 1.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (Fig. S4, ESI†). Under D-SVA, the optimized phase separation morphology is expected to maximize the carrier transport process without compromising exciton separation efficiency values. The differential EQE values shown in Fig. 1(c) demonstrate that the moderate phase separation morphology optimized by D-SVA could suppress the formation of an EP-PDI excimer and thus facilitate the exciton separation in the EP-PDI phase. By contrast, the crystal growth of EP-PDI perpendicular as well as parallel to the substrate proceeds all the time, followed by the enhanced crystallization of the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 component with the increase of the EA vapor/TA annealing time and thus significantly observed is the undesirable large phase separation with the size greater than the exciton diffusion length, which is detrimental to the exciton diffusion as well as exciton separation processes. Meanwhile, the photo-induced excitons in large PDI phases also tend to form stabilized excimers, which further reduce these two parameters.43 Therefore, though the optimized crystallinity facilitates the enhancement of carrier transport to some extent, large crystalline domains induced by TA/EA-SVA treatments have a negative effect on the exciton separation process and thus the final device performance gets limited optimization.
Conclusions
In summary, the phase-separated morphology and the crystallite size in PDI-based non-fullerene OPVs exhibited entirely different morphological characteristics under various post-treatment methods. Due to the good compatibility between donor and acceptor molecules, amorphous intermixed phases exist in the as-deposited film. D-SVA treatment facilitated the formation of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 fibrous crystals when the EP-PDI component existed in the form of a small microcrystal state, thus developing the required bi-continuous network structure. Nevertheless, P-SVA or TA treatment induced significant enhancement of crystallinity for p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and EP-PDI components, thus leading to significant film coarsening, or even hundreds of nanometers phase separation. The formation of a bi-continuous network structure with a smaller crystallite size under D-SVA was demonstrated to be beneficial to both exciton separation and carrier transport. As a consequence, the D-SVA treated device achieved a maximum enhancement in final performance and the PCE value increased from less than 0.2% up to 3.0%.
