    , Accepted 15th May 2022First published on 17th May 2022AbstractPhoton upconversion microcrystals based on triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) were developed involving thermally activated energy transfer and a singlet energy collection mechanism. Efficient solid-state upconversion with an apparent anti-Stokes shift of 0.8 eV was achieved and the upconversion quantum yield was increased by 40% by the singlet energy collector, which inhibited the FRET-type back energy transfer from the upconverted annihilator to the sensitizer. The improvement in the upconversion microcrystals practically benefited the upconversion-driven photoproduction of hydrogen, demonstrating the potential of solid-state TTA upconversion materials in optoelectronics and photocatalysis.
Introduction
Photon upconversion techniques convert lower-energy photons into higher-energy ones and have been successfully applied in many research fields involving optical transduction and energy conversion.1–3 Compared to upconversion techniques using multiphoton absorption, lanthanide nanoparticles and second harmonic nonlinear optical materials, triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) upconversion has been valued in solar cells,4–7 biological applications,8,9 photocatalysis10–13 and many other fields,14–18 due to its low excitation power density and broad absorption and emission bands. A TTA upconversion system generally includes two parts, a sensitizer (donor) and an annihilator (acceptor). Briefly, the TTA upconversion process is initiated with the absorption of photons at longer wavelengths by the sensitizers, which can sensitize the annihilators to their triplets via triplet–triplet energy transfer (TTET). Two triplet annihilators meet and annihilate, generating a singlet excited annihilator with higher energy, which finally releases an upconverted photon of higher-energy.
Typical TTA upconversion maintains a theoretical spin statistical limit towards an upconversion quantum yield of approximately 20% (out of 50% maximum). Although the TTA upconversion systems in solution have achieved a relatively high upconversion quantum efficiency,19–21 the solid-state TTA upconversion system is attracting more and more attention due to its application relevance and polymeric and crystalline TTA upconversion systems have been realized via various doping approaches.22–24 However, in solid systems with dense chromophores, the singlet energy back transfers from upconverted annihilators to sensitizers become prominent and must be tackled to further improve the upconversion quantum efficiency (Fig. 1a).25,26 A singlet energy collector strategy refers to using a singlet energy acceptor that collects the singlet energy from upconverted annihilators before the upconverted energy is trapped by the sensitizers. This strategy indeed has been proved to be effective for inhibiting FRET-type back energy transfer both in liquid and solid TTA upconversion systems.27–32 However, an inevitable loss in the apparent anti-Stokes shift of TTA upconversion occurs due to the conventional downhill energy transfer between the annihilators and singlet energy collectors. This trade-off issue could be solved by introducing thermally activated TTA upconversion, a recently proposed mechanism involving endothermic TTET from sensitizers to annihilators,33–35 where the sensitizer triplet energy level is lower than the annihilator triplet energy level and the triplet energy barrier is overcome through an endothermic TTET from the sensitizer to the annihilator during TTA upconversion. With the aid of the energy gain from endothermic energy transfer, the apparent anti-Stokes shift of TTA upconversion can easily approach or exceed 1 eV, based on the difference between the lowest absorption maximum of the sensitizer and the annihilator emission peak.36 It can be expected that merging the singlet energy collector and endothermic TTET strategies could enhance the performance of TTA upconversion systems in the solid state, and consequently advance their applications in photonics and energy conversion.

Here we report a solid state TTA upconversion system employing thermally activated energy transfer and a singlet energy collection mechanism, which consists of a palladium(II) meso-tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrin (PdTPTBP) sensitizer, a 9,10-diphenylanthracene (DPA) annihilator and a dendritic molecule wire (MWDPA) acting as the singlet energy collector (Fig. 1b). Experimental results indicate that the dendritic singlet energy collector effectively reduces the singlet energy back transfer from DPA to the sensitizer and enhances the upconversion quantum yield (UC QY) by more than 40%, reaching 7.8% (with theoretical maximum of 50%). Furthermore, the enhanced upconversion emission is practically utilized to increase hydrogen photoproduction by combining the solid upconversion system with a photocatalyst Cd0.5Zn0.5S. To the best of our knowledge, this study verified for the first time an application of singlet energy collection and thermally activated TTA upconversion in enhancing light-harvesting and photochemical conversion, which is highly relevant to future development and application prospects of solid TTA upconversion materials.
Results and discussion
We recently reported a thermally activated TTA upconversion combination using PdTPTBP as the sensitizer and DPA as the annihilator, where the triplet levels of PdTPTBP and DPA are 1.59 (corresponding to singlet to triplet absorption at 780 nm) and 1.77 eV, respectively.33 Thermally activated TTET from PdTPTBP to DPA overcoming an energy gap of 0.18 eV enables efficient TTA upconversion in the solid state, achieving over 5% upconversion QY and a large apparent anti-Stokes shift based on the absorption peak of PdTPTBP at 629 nm and the emission peak of DPA at 415 nm (Fig. 2). However, it is foreseeable that the singlet energy of DPA could be transferred back to the sensitizer via Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) because of the dense molecular packing and the substantial overlap between the emission of DPA and the Soret band of the sensitizer. In this study, we incorporated a singlet energy collector with dendritic architecture to harvest the singlet energy of DPA in the thermally activated TTA upconversion system and enhanced the upconversion emission efficiency therein.
 Fig. 2  Absorption spectra of PdTPTBP and MWDPA and normalized emission spectra of DPA and MWDPA in toluene (λex = 375 nm). 
The singlet energy collector (MWDPA) adopts p-phenylene ethynylene oligomers (PPE) as the wire-like core and DPA carboxylate derivatives at the periphery of poly(aryl ether) dendrons as the energy-harvesting antenna (Fig. 1b). The molecular wire core PPE holds a singlet energy level of 2.75 eV (corresponding to the emission peak at 450 nm), slightly lower than that of DPA, making it a suitable singlet energy sink for upconverted DPA (Fig. 2). The fluorescence quantum yield of MWDPA in toluene is 73.6% upon excitation at 380 nm where the DPA units absorb. The dendritic and multi DPA antenna shell is expected to mediate singlet energy collection and disperse the molecular wire in the DPA matrix and avoid PPE aggregation as well. Before preparing MWDPA, a dendritic monomer consisting of phenylacetylene as the core and DPA dendrons as the periphery was synthesized (ESI†). MWDPA was synthesized through a series of efficient coupling reactions and characterized by NMR and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) (Scheme 1, Fig. S4 and S5, ESI†).37 Upon excitation of the peripheral DPA derivatives at 375 nm, only the emission from the PPE core appears, suggesting efficient singlet energy transfer from the DPA units to the wire core PPE (Fig. 2). The fluorescence decay of the PPE core was probed by femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) monitoring the stimulated emission of the PPE core at 500 nm, giving a time constant of 591 ps (Fig. S6, ESI†). While exciting the peripheral DPA of MWDPA at 400 nm, the stimulated emission of PPE at 500 nm shows a slow rising kinetics on a 12 ps timescale, compared to the instantaneous rise of the stimulated emission upon direct excitation of PPE at 450 nm (ESI,† Fig. S6 inset). The rise on the ps time scale is attributed to the energy transfer process from the peripheral DPA units to the PPE core and nearly unity efficiency is estimated according to the 12 ps rising time and the fluorescence lifetime of the DPA chromophores (10.8 ns).31,38 Such a fast energy transfer with high efficiency ensures the singlet energy harvesting capability of MWDPA in TTA upconversion systems.

We examined the binary PdTPTBP-MWDPA system in solution at the beginning and found that PdTPTBP-MWDPA exhibits red-shifted emission with a much lower upconversion quantum yield than that of PdTPTBP-DPA. The covalently bonded DPA chromophore on MWDPA limits the triplet annihilator diffusion and reduces the effective concentration of the annihilator in solution, which is detrimental to the upconversion. In addition, the dendritic DPA antennae are not enough to eliminate the PPE aggregation in the solid state, leading to yellowish fluorescence MWDPA (Fig. S7, ESI†). Therefore, MWDPA is applied as the singlet energy collector rather than the annihilator to show positive contribution in this work. The performance of MWDPA as the singlet energy collector to enhance a thermally activated TTA upconversion system was evaluated in crystalline samples. Upconversion microcrystals composed of PdTPTBP and DPA with/without MWDPA were prepared by a coprecipitation method without surfactants. The prepared upconversion microcrystals were irregular particles with a size of about 2 microns according to dynamic light scattering and confocal microscopy observation (Fig. S9 and 10, ESI†). All the microcrystals exhibit blue upconversion emission while excited by a 635 nm laser. Furthermore, a comparison of the absorption spectra of PdTPTBP in toluene, PdTPTBP/DPA and PdTPTBP/DPA/MWDPA microcrystals was performed. The peak position of the Q-band at 629 nm shows no significant change for PdTPTBP in solution and doped crystals, indicating that PdTPTBP has good dispersibility in the annihilator matrix during fast crystallization (Fig. S11, ESI†).39,40 Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and confocal microscopy imaging show that the small doping amount of PdTPTBP and MWDPA has a negligible effect on crystal size and crystallinity (Fig. S8–S10, ESI†). Steady-state and time-resolved phosphorescence quenching experiments show that the phosphorescence is almost quenched in the presence of DPA, indicative of near unit TTET efficiency (Fig. S14, ESI†).33 The TTA upconversion microcrystal with an optimal doping ratio of PdTPTBP (0.001 mol%) presents an upconversion QY of 5.5% under excitation at 200 mW cm−2 by a continuous wave laser of 635 nm.33 The upconversion QY is evidently increased with the doping amount of MWDPA increasing from 0.0002 to 0.002 mol% and reaches a maximum of 7.8%, indicative of the positive contribution from the singlet energy collector (Fig. 3b). However, higher doping content of MWDPA results in decreases in the upconversion QY, which is probably due to the aggregation of the singlet energy collector.27,28 The upconversion emission upon MWDPA doping shows a slight decrease in the high-energy part (< 450 nm) and an evident enhancement in the long wavelength region, which is ascribed to the energy harvesting effect by MWDPA (Fig. 3c and Fig. S12, ESI†). The excitation power density extracted from the double logarithmic plots of upconversion emission vs. excitation intensity shows no distinct change after MWDPA doping, implying that the singlet energy collector does not interfere in the TTA process (Fig. 3d). Moreover, it is worth noting that the apparent anti-Stokes shift of the solid-state upconversion is kept around 0.8 eV owing to the energy gain from the thermally activated sensitization.

(d) A double logarithmic curve of UCPL intensity as a function of excitation light power density for PdTPTBP (0.001 mol%)/DPA/MWDPA (0.002%). 
The fluorescence quantum yields of PdTPTBP/DPA and PdTPTBP/DPA/MWDPA microcrystals upon excitation of the DPA units were measured to see the contribution of the fluorescence QY upon MWDPA doping (Fig. S13, ESI†). The fluorescence QY increases first and then decreases as the doping content of MWDPA increases, which is consistent with the variation trend of the upconversion quantum yield shown in Fig. 3b, suggesting the contribution of MWDPA by collecting singlet excited energy of DPA. To get insight into the upconversion enhancement function of the singlet energy collector, time-resolved fluorescence experiments were carried out. The fluorescence decay of DPA in the microcrystals shows a monoexponential lifetime of 9.9 ns. Upon doping with a small amount of PdTPTBP (0.001 mol%), the lifetime is evidently shortened to 6.6 ns, suggesting evident energy transfer from the excited singlet DPA to PdTPTBP, which is a detrimental process to the final upconversion emission output (Fig. 4a). In contrast, the fluorescence lifetimes of DPA in DPA/MWDPA and PdTPTBP/DPA/MWDPA are 8.0 and 7.0 ns, respectively, showing a smaller quenching effect by PdTPTBP upon MWDPA doping (Fig. 4b). In the presence of MWDPA, the sensitizer cannot induce a significant decrease of the fluorescence lifetime compared to that in the samples without MWDPA doping. Taking into account the evident enhancement of the upconversion QY by MWDPA doping, it is believed that the singlet energy collector competes with the sensitizer in harvesting the energy of excited singlet DPA, and consequently reduced the back energy transfer to the sensitizer.

The TTA upconversion microcrystals relying on thermally activated sensitization have the ability to convert red photons into blue photons, which is attractive for photochemical conversion applications. The practical performance of the singlet energy collector in TTA upconversion was further evaluated in hydrogen photoproduction by combining with Cd0.5Zn0.5S nanoparticles as the photocatalyst (Fig. S15, ESI†). The photocatalyst Cd0.5Zn0.5S nanoparticles possess a band gap of 2.50 eV, indicating that photons of wavelength longer than 496 nm cannot be absorbed by the photocatalyst.12,41 The upconversion luminescence of the upconversion microcrystals overlaps well with the absorption of Cd0.5Zn0.5S nanoparticles and it is expected that hydrogen production could proceed with the aid of TTA upconversion upon 635 nm excitation (Fig. S16, ESI†). The photocatalysts were synthesized according to the literature reports and characterized by a uniform size, lattice stripes and uniform elemental distributions (Fig. S17, ESI†).41 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that the granular photocatalyst is around 40–80 nm in size. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy showed that the nanoparticles had a clear crystal form with a lattice fringe of 0.32 nm, which was assigned to the {111} planes of the zinc blende lattice. Elemental analysis was carried out by scanning TEM and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, which confirmed that cadmium, zinc, and sulfur elements were uniformly dispersed in the nanoparticles.
In the hydrogen production system, TTA upconversion microcrystal Cd0.5Zn0.5S nanoparticles, sacrificial reagents Na2S and Na2SO3, and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) are mixed in water together, forming a suspension. A 10 W LED (λ = 629 nm) was used to illuminate the mixture suspension and the amount of photogenerated hydrogen at various time intervals was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) using nitrogen as a carrier gas, molecular sieve 5 Å columns and a TCD detector. Hydrogen production was observed both in the PdTPTBP/DPA and PdTPTBP/DPA/MWDPA systems, indicative of effective upconversion driven photocatalysis. The hydrogen amount produced in the system employing PdTPTBP/DPA/MWDPA microcrystals reached 39.93 ± 6.14 μL upon two hours of irradiation at 200 mW cm−2, which was substantially higher than that (37.74 ± 5.00 μL) from the system using upconversion microcrystals without MWDPA doping (Fig. 5). This result verified that the increase in upconversion emission intensity by doping MWDPA is indeed beneficial to the photocatalytic hydrogen production utilizing sub-band gap photons. The difference between upconversion enhancement and the photocatalytic increase may be rationalized by considering that the emission of the upconversion microcrystals partially overlaps with the absorption of the photocatalyst, and upon MWDPA doping, the upconversion emission slightly shifts to longer wavelengths, which reduces the overlap. These factors may lead to less increase in the photocatalytic performance than the enhancement in upconversion emission. Considering the modification diversity of singlet energy collectors and TTA upconversion systems, it is promising to develop efficient upconversion converting near-infrared photons for practical use in augmentation of optoelectronics and photocatalysis.

Inset shows a schematic representation of photocatalytic hydrogen production employing a Cd0.5Zn0.5S catalyst and upconversion microcrystals. 
Conclusions
In summary, singlet energy collector MWDPA with PPE as a wire-type core and DPA-modified dendron as a periphery was designed and prepared. Time-resolved spectroscopy reveals that the PPE core can effectively collect the singlet energy of DPA chromophores, thus inhibiting the back energy transfer from DPA to the sensitizer during the TTA upconversion system. By doping MWDPA in the TTA upconversion system involving the thermally activated sensitization combination of DPA and PdTPTBP, the upconversion QY is increased by more than 40%. Moreover, the upconversion emission enhancement by the singlet energy collector shows substantial promotion of the photocatalytic hydrogen production. This study experimentally demonstrates the potential of solid TTA upconversion involving singlet energy collection and thermally activated sensitization, which may provide more alternative strategies in low-energy photon utilization in the future.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Schematic diagram of TTA upconversion energy levels involving thermally activated sensitization and singlet energy collection. (b) Chemical structures of the donor (PdTPTBP), the acceptor (DPA) and the singlet energy collector (MWDPA).	 

 	Fig. 2  Absorption spectra of PdTPTBP and MWDPA and normalized emission spectra of DPA and MWDPA in toluene (λex = 375 nm).	 

 	Scheme 1  Synthetic route of MWDPA. Reagents and conditions: (1) (Ph3P)4Pd, CuI, iso-Pr2NH, and THF, and 50 °C, 24 h; (2) PhCCH and 50 °C, 12 h.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Schematic flow diagram of the preparation of upconversion microcrystals by co-precipitation. (b) Upconversion quantum yields of PdTPTBP (0.001 mol%)/DPA/MWDPA microcrystals with varying doping contents of the singlet energy collector MWDPA (λex = 635 nm, 200 mW cm−2). Inset shows the photographs of PdTPTBP(0.001 mol%)/DPA with/without 0.002% MWDPA doping taken through a short pass filter under 635 nm LED irradiation. (c) Upconversion photoluminescence (UCPL) spectra of PdTPTBP (0.001 mol%)/DPA/MWDPA (0.002 mol%) at different excitation light power densities (λex = 635 nm). (d) A double logarithmic curve of UCPL intensity as a function of excitation light power density for PdTPTBP (0.001 mol%)/DPA/MWDPA (0.002%).	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Fluorescence decays of microcrystalline DPA at 445 nm with or without doping of 0.001% PdTPTBP. (b) Fluorescence decays of DPA/MWDPA (0.002%) at 445 nm in the presence or absence of 0.001% PdTPTBP (λex = 375 nm). The red solid lines are corresponding fittings to the data.	 

 	Fig. 5  Upconversion photoproduction by Cd0.5Zn0.5S combining upconversion microcrystals with or without doping MWDPA. The mass concentration of upconversion microcrystals is 2 mgmL−1, [Cd0.5Zn0.5S] = 2 mgmL−1, [Na2S] = 0.175M, [Na2SO3] = 0.125 M, and [SDS] = 5 mM. Inset shows a schematic representation of photocatalytic hydrogen production employing a Cd0.5Zn0.5S catalyst and upconversion microcrystals.
