    , Accepted 3rd November 2018First published on 5th November 2018AbstractNickel tungstate nanoparticles (NiWO4 NPs) that were synthesized by an electrochemical method under various reaction conditions, namely, different tungstate ion concentrations, voltages, temperatures, and stirring rates, were studied here. These NPs were characterized using FT-IR, XRD, SEM, and thermal analysis techniques. The application of the NiWO4 NPs as an excellent photocatalyst was investigated via the degradation of methyl orange (MO) under illumination with UV radiation. The maximum conversion of MO reached about 87% after 100 min. Furthermore, the electrochemical properties were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and continuous cyclic voltammetry (CCV) in 3.0 M H2SO4 as the electrolyte. The electrochemical investigations revealed that an NiWO4 electrode displayed enhanced supercapacitive performance, including a specific capacitance of 468 F g−1 at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1. Furthermore, CCV measurements showed that the NiWO4 electrode retained 102.2% of its initial capacitance after 4000 cycles.
1. Introduction
The controllable synthesis of nanomaterials (NMs) is a crucial aspect of materials science because the properties of NMs strongly depend on their morphology, structures, and composition.1–3 Numerous studies have been carried out via different approaches for the synthesis of nanostructures with controlled shapes and compositions.4–7 Among these synthesis methods, electrochemical deposition is one of the most powerful methods for the synthesis of NPs. It is simple, easily scaled up, low-cost, and eco-friendly, and the morphology and composition of the NPs can easily be adjusted via operational parameters such as the voltage, temperature, and electrolyte concentration, etc.8–14 This method is appropriate for the synthesis of noble metal oxides with large surface areas. Metal oxide NPs are widely employed as heterogeneous catalysts and in environmental remediation, colloid science, chemical sensors, and optoelectronics, electronics, and medicinal applications, exhibit antimicrobial activity and are used in separation,15–18 and these applications depend on the morphology and size of the metal oxide, which depend on the synthesis method.19,20 Transition metal tungstates with the general formula MWO4 owing to their chemical, physical, structural and photoluminescence properties are of more interest than all the various types of metal oxide.21–24 Among all these types of tungstate, nickel tungstate (NiWO4) has critical properties such as electrochromic properties and high stability and is suitable as an electrode and a catalytic material. NiWO4 has the wolframite crystal structure in which Ni2+ has a small ionic radius of ∼0.69 Å with the space group P2/c. The values of the AC (alternating current) and DC (direct current) electrical conductivity of a nickel tungstate crystal in the temperature range from 25 to 800 °C showed that the band gap of NiWO4 is 2.10 eV.25 Therefore, it has semiconducting properties. This band gap is important for antimicrobial, antifouling, solar energy conversion, and photocatalysis applications.26–28
Some complex problems that affect living organisms and disturb the balance of ecological units are the results of environmental pollution. One form of pollution that causes severe problems to human beings is organic waste. The removal of organic contamination from waste has been one of the most critical issues in recent years. Much attention has recently been paid to photocatalytic agents because of their extensive applications in the green synthesis of organic compounds, hydrogen generation, renewable energy, decontamination, self-sterilizing surfaces, and photocatalytic lithography. The removal of organic dyes (such as methyl orange (MO)) from the waste from many factories and agricultural industries by photocatalytic methods is one of the most critical issues in the environment.29–31 NiWO4 NPs, because of their low cost, narrow band gap and high catalytic efficiency, have been used as a photocatalyst.32–36
Supercapacitors are electrochemical energy storage devices that are primarily attractive because of their fast charging and discharging capability, long-lasting stability and safe handling.37,38 Because of these unique qualities, supercapacitors are ideal candidates for some applications including regenerative braking in cars, static random access memory and motor starters.39,40 The increasing cost of fuels, pollution, global warming, and geopolitical concerns are among the problems connected with the dependence of modern societies on fossil fuels. Addressing these issues is an increasingly important goal that can be achieved by developing other energy sources and storage technologies. As a result, there has recently been growing interest in high-power-density and high-energy-density storage systems. As energy storage/delivery devices, supercapacitors hold great technical potential in power systems owing to their high-power characteristics with adequate capacity and a long cycle life.
The purpose of this study was to optimize the parameters of the synthesis reaction of NiWO4 by the Taguchi robust design method. These parameters included the concentration of the electrolyte solution (WO42−), voltage, temperature, and stirring speed used for the electrolyte solution.41,42 Then, the morphology and structure of the NiWO4 compound that was produced were investigated by SEM, UV-Vis and FT-IR spectroscopy, XRD, and thermal analysis methods. Furthermore, the NPs were used as a photocatalytic agent for the degradation of MO, and the supercapacitive performance of an NiWO4 electrode was evaluated using various methods.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Sodium tungstate of analytical grade and MO were purchased from Merck. All the solutions were prepared with deionized (DI) water. For the preparation of NPs, electrochemical methods were used.
2.2. Synthesis of nickel tungstate nanoparticles
For the synthesis of NiWO4 NPs, an electrochemical deposition method was used under different reaction conditions, which can be seen in Table 1. In a typical procedure, to prepare 200 mL of the electrolyte solution with different concentrations, a certain amount of sodium tungstate was added to distilled water. Then, the anode and cathode, which comprised a nickel electrode (2 × 4 cm with 99.5% purity) and a stainless-steel electrode (2 × 4 cm), respectively, were inserted into the electrolyte solution. Both electrodes were washed before use with hydrochloric acid and distilled water. The distance between the two electrodes was about 3 cm during the experiments. Electrolysis was performed in an undivided electrochemical container for 2 hours at a temperature of between 0 and 50 °C, a voltage of 3–9 V, and a stirring rate of 100–600 rpm.

After the electrolysis, the light green precipitate was centrifuged and washed with ethanol and finally with distilled water. The product was then dried in a hot air oven for 2 hours at 80 °C. To study the thermal resistance of nickel tungstate, this compound was calcined at different temperatures in the range of 25–700 °C.
2.3. Characterization
To characterize the NPs in terms of their chemical structure, FT-IR spectra were recorded with a PerkinElmer (Spectrum Two) spectrophotometer in the wavenumber range of 4000–500 cm−1 by the use of the KBr pellet technique. The XRD pattern (Rigaku D/max 2500 V diffractometer equipped with a graphite monochromator and a Cu target) was utilized to determine the crystal structure of the NiWO4 NPs. For the measurement of the sizes of NiWO4 NPs, SEM images were recorded with a TESCAN series instrument, for which samples were loaded on a gold film. To analyze the thermal behaviour of NPs, 30 mg samples were loaded onto the pan of thermogravimetric (TG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) instruments and thermograms were recorded under operating conditions of the analysis that comprised heating in the range of 25–700 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1 in an inert atmosphere of nitrogen. UV-Vis spectra were recorded with a UV-Vis spectrometer (PerkinElmer Lambda 25) to assess the degradation of water pollutants.
2.4. Photocatalytic activity
Methyl orange (MO), as an organic pollutant, was used to assess the photocatalytic activity of the NiWO4 NPs under UV irradiation. Using a high-pressure Hg lamp (250 W, λ > 280 nm), which was placed in a quartz pipe reactor, UV irradiation was carried out. A 500 mL aqueous solution of MO (5 mg L−1) was prepared, to which 0.05 g of the photocatalyst (0.1 g L−1) was added. In order to achieve equilibrium in the adsorption reaction, the reaction solution was stirred for 30 minutes in a dark environment before exposure to UV light. To examine the MO degradation reaction, samples were removed from the reaction vessel during the illumination at intervals of 10 minutes. These samples were centrifuged, and then UV-Vis spectra were recorded at the maximum absorption wavelength of MO. The temperature during the test was maintained at about 25 °C, which was achieved by the reactor coolant section.
The relationship between light absorption (A) and the solution concentration (C) is described by the Lambert–Beer law (eqn (1)):33 A = εbC(1)where A is light absorption, ε is the molar absorptivity, b is the path length of the sample and C is the concentration of the pollutant in the solution. At and A0 are the absorption values recorded at time t and 0 min, which correspond to solution concentrations of Ct and C0, respectively, and their ratio is given by eqn (2): (2)
In addition, the efficiency of photocatalytic degradation was calculated by eqn (3): (3)
The Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetic model was used to investigate the photocatalytic degradation kinetics of MO, which is usually considered at a low initial concentration for studying the degradation of organic molecules. The following equation was used for the kinetic model:33 (4)where C is the concentration of MO, kapp is the reaction rate constant, t is the degradation time and  represents the reaction rate.
2.5. Electrochemical studies
Part of the electrochemical measurements were performed on an electrochemical workstation (PGSTAT204, Autolab, the Netherlands) in three-electrode and two-electrode mode in a 0.5 M aqueous solution of Na2SO4. The working electrodes were prepared for the electrochemical tests by preparing a mixture of NiWO4 with acetylene black, graphite and polytetrafluoroethylene at a mass ratio of 65:20:10:5 in ethanol. The resulting uniform paste was then pressed onto a current collector, which comprised a piece of stainless steel, in order to form the electrodes. For this purpose, about 3 mg of the electroactive material and a 1 cm2 current collector were used. Finally, the electrodes were dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 4 h. The reference and counter electrodes comprised Ag/AgCl and a platinum electrode, respectively. A three-electrode cell system was used to evaluate the electrochemical performance by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and continuous cyclic voltammetry (CCV).
3. Results and discussion
The electrochemical method is a suitable synthesis technique that was employed to produce NiWO4 NPs in different reaction conditions, namely, different electrolyte concentrations, temperatures, voltages and stirring rates used for the solution, which are listed in Table 1. These parameters greatly affected the shape, size, and yield of the NPs.
3.1. Nickel tungstate synthesis procedure and SEM study
The adjustment of the sizes of particles formed in an electrochemical procedure is a complicated step, and understanding the relationships between the process parameters and the size of the product is time-consuming. However, statistical methods can be helpful, and with the help of these methods as a shortcut it is possible to determine the effect of each single parameter on the sizes of nanoparticles. Therefore, the effects of several variables, namely, the concentration of tungstate, applied voltage, temperature and stirring rate, on the sizes of the NiWO4 particles were assessed at three levels, which are listed in Table 1. SEM images of NiWO4 samples that were produced in various test conditions are shown in Fig. 1. As seen in Table 1, the sizes of the NiWO4 particles were different for various reaction conditions. In other words, the sizes of the NPs depended on the reaction conditions. The average size of the synthesized NiWO4 particles is displayed in the last column of Table 1 for each run. From these results, the optimum value of each parameter can be calculated,43,44 and bar graphs of the results that were obtained are shown in Fig. 2. These graphs show the changes in the size of the NiWO4 particles after the changes in each reaction parameter. The effect of the WO42− concentration at three levels (0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 mol L−1) on the size of the NiWO4 particles is shown in Fig. 2A. As can be seen, the optimum concentration of tungstate ions for the electrodeposition of NiWO4 particles was 0.05 M, which resulted in the smallest size of the NiWO4 particles. Fig. 2B shows the effect of the applied voltage (3, 6, and 9 V) on the size of the NiWO4 particles. The best voltage for the production of NiWO4 NPs was 6 V. The last parameters that were studied were the temperature of the reactor (0, 25 and 50 °C) and the stirring rate (100, 300 and 600 rpm). Upon changes in these parameters, the changes in the NiWO4 NPs were very slight (Fig. 2C and D).

To assess the effects of the variables that were studied on the control of the NiWO4 NPs, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used, of which the results are shown in Table 2. According to the ANOVA results (at a 90% confidence interval), the tungstate anion concentration and applied voltage played a major role in controlling the size of the NiWO4 NPs, if possible interactions between variables are ignored. According to these results, the optimum conditions for producing NiWO4 NPs with the smallest particle size are a tungstate ion concentration of 0.05 mol L−1 and an applied voltage of 6 V, respectively, and a TEM image of optimal nanoparticles can be seen in Fig. 3. The Taguchi experimental design method provides the following equation for calculating the size of NiWO4 NPs in optimum conditions: (5)where Yopt is the size of the NiWO4 NPs in optimum conditions, T is the sum of all results, N is the total number of experiments performed, Cx and Vy are the average sizes of the product (at the optimum levels of the WO42− concentration and applied voltage, respectively) (Fig. 2) and T/N is the average size of the NiWO4 NPs (Table 1). Subsequently, the following equation is employed to predict the value of the confidence interval (CI) that corresponds to the size of the NiWO4 NPs in optimum conditions:45,46 (6)where Ve is the variance of error, Fα(f1, f2) is the critical value of F at a level of significance of α (90%), and f1 and f2 are degrees of freedom (DOFs), of which f1 = DOF for the mean (which always equals 1) and f2 = DOF for the error term. In addition, ne is the number of effective replications, which can be calculated by the following equation:3,33,47,48 (7)

 Fig. 3  TEM image of NiWO4 NPs produced in optimum conditions. 
On the basis of the ANOVA results, the average size of the NiWO4 NPs under optimum conditions is about 26 ± 10 nm. The optimum reaction conditions (a concentration of tungstate ions of 0.05 M and an applied voltage of 6 V) were used to synthesize NiWO4 NPs via the electrodeposition approach. According to the variables and results listed in Table 1, the second experiment listed in this table had the same conditions as those predicted by ANOVA. Fig. 1A shows an SEM image of particles produced in this experiment, which had an average particle size of 30 nm. This value is consistent with the range (26 ± 10 nm) predicted by ANOVA. After that, NiWO4 NPs that were obtained in the optimum conditions were characterized to confirm their composition, structure, and optical and thermal behavior by FT-IR, XRD, TG/DTA, and UV-Vis spectrophotometry.
3.2. XRD study
The XRD pattern of the NiWO4 NPs shown in Fig. 4 displays the main diffraction peaks of the monoclinic NiWO4 phase at 2θ = 65.9°, 54.7°, 52.4°, 49°, 41.8°, 36.6°, 31.0°, 25.0°, and 24.0° [JCPDS 15-0755], which correspond to the (311), (202), (130), (002), (102), (200), (111), (110) and (011) crystallographic planes, respectively. Very small lines at 2θ = 16°, 17°, 28° and 33.2° are also present and are ascribed to WO3 of low crystallinity. This pattern confirmed the high crystallinity and purity of the NiWO4 NPs. The average crystallite size of NiWO4 was calculated by the Debye–Scherrer equation: D = 0.9λ/(βcosθ)(8)where λ (X-ray radiation wavelength) is 0.154 nm, β is the modified band broadening, and θ is the Bragg angle. The average crystal size of the NiWO4 NPs calculated by the Debye–Scherrer equation was about 33 nm, which demonstrates that the resulting nanoparticles were single crystals.

3.3. FT-IR study
The chemical structure of NiWO4 NPs synthesized by the electrochemical method under optimum conditions was determined by FT-IR spectroscopy. Fig. 5 shows the FT-IR spectra of optimally produced NiWO4 NPs both before and after heating at various temperatures. Before heating, three wide absorption peaks were observed at about 846, 1625 and 3421 cm−1. However, after the sample was heated to 250 °C, some divided absorption peaks appeared in the spectrum that were consistent with the monoclinic structure of NiWO4. When the temperature was raised to 600 °C, the overall appearance of the FT-IR spectrum changed. In the new spectrum, several peaks appeared at 575, 724, and 891 cm−1 that were due to stretching vibrations of bridging W–O–W bonds. These changes represent a phase transition from the amorphous sample to a crystalline structure.48–50

3.4. TG/DTA study
To assess the thermal stability of inorganic materials (such as NPs), thermal analysis methods such as TG/DTA are used. Thermoanalytical curves (TG/DTA) for NiWO4 NPs (prepared under the best conditions) are illustrated in Fig. 6. The TG result revealed that the NiWO4 NPs underwent a mass loss of about 10% in the temperature range of 50–240 °C, which occurred because of the removal of surface-adsorbed water and gases at lower temperatures and the main part of water of crystallization at higher temperatures in this range. Because of the release of water trapped in the crystalline structure of the NiWO4 NPs, a small weight loss of about 3% happened above 240 °C up to about 400 °C. At temperatures above 400 °C, no significant changes in the mass of the sample were observed. In the temperature range of 100–240 °C the DTA curve for the NiWO4 NPs sample displays a small, wide endothermic peak, which is due to dehydration of the sample. The DTA curve for the NiWO4 NPs also exhibits a sharp exothermic peak without any sample mass loss at 560 °C. This was because of the phase transition from the amorphous phase to the monoclinic structure.

3.5. UV-Vis study
UV-Vis spectra are utilized to resolve the excitonic or interband transitions of inorganic materials such as NiWO4 NPs. Fig. 7 shows the UV-Vis spectrum of the NiWO4 NPs (dispersed in DI water). In semiconductor materials, the optical band gap is calculated approximately by the following equation:33–35 αhν = A(hν − Eg)η(9)where h is Planck's constant, ν is the frequency of light, α is the absorption coefficient, Eg is the band gap energy, and A is a constant of proportionality. The value of the exponent η is 1/2 for direct transitions and 2 for indirect transitions. In this study, the value of η was 1/2 for the NiWO4 NPs. Fig. 8 shows a plot of (αhν)2versus hν, which gives the band gap energy (Eg). The band gap of the NiWO4 NPs was calculated to be approximately 3.1 eV from the UV-Vis spectrum. This gap corresponds to an absorption edge around 400 nm for the NiWO4 NPs, which is compatible with literature values.51–53

3.6. Photocatalytic elimination of methyl orange

Fig. 9 shows the UV-Vis spectra whereby the photodegradation performance of NiWO4 NPs as a photocatalyst for MO was monitored to assess the photocatalytic activity of the NPs. Fig. 10 illustrates the variations in the concentration of the MO solution in the presence of NiWO4 NPs under UV irradiation. This plot was drawn in terms of the C/C0 value and degradation efficiency versus irradiation time. The results show that MO was degraded in the presence of NiWO4 NPs, and a maximum degradation of about 87% was observed after UV irradiation for 100 minutes.

The kinetics of the degradation reaction of MO in the presence of NiWO4 NPs showed that this reaction is pseudo-first-order (Fig. 11), and the slope of the linear regression line proves this. The rate constant and maximum conversion of the photocatalysis are given in Table 3, and these results indicate that NiWO4 NPs are respectable and useful photocatalysts for the elimination of organic pollutants.

3.7. Electrochemical studies

3.7.1. CV and specific capacitances. 
The supercapacitive behavior of the NiWO4 electrode was monitored using a three-electrode system and a 3.0 M H2SO4 solution as the electrolyte. We performed the measurements under ambient conditions in the optimized potential range of −0.3 to 0.35 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at various scan rates. We used CV as a potentiodynamic electrochemical technique for calculating the specific capacitance (SC) of the electrode, as well as the current responses of the electroactive materials under applied potentials. Fig. 12a illustrates the CV curves of the NiWO4 electrode at scan rates of 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, 75 and 100 mV s−1, respectively.
 Fig. 12  CV curves for the NiWO4 electrode recorded at different scan rates of 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, 75 and 100 mV s−1 in the potential range of −0.3 to 0.35 V in a 3.0 M H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte (a), plot of SC vs. scan rate for the NiWO4 electrode (b), variations in the SC of the NiWO4 electrode as a function of the number of cycles at 200 mV s−1 (c) and 3D-CCV curves for the NiWO4 electrode recorded at a scan rate of 200 mV s−1 (d). 
The voltammograms recorded for the NiWO4 electrode are rectangular and almost symmetric and represent the ideal capacitive behavior of this sample. Electrochemical reversibility is one of the most important factors that affect the power and capability of electrochemical supercapacitors. Therefore, the reversibility of the nickel tungstate electrode was studied by analyzing cyclic voltammograms for the sample recorded at various scan speeds. The rectangular shape and symmetry of the i–E curve indicate the very good reversibility of the sample in this range at various scan rates. The SC of the electrode was calculated from the cyclic voltammograms using the equation given below:37 (10)where ν is the potential scan rate (mV s−1), Vc and Va are the limits of the potential range, and I denotes the response current (mA g−1) based on the mass of the electroactive material.

Fig. 12b illustrates the behavior of the NiWO4 electrode in terms of SC vs. scan rate. It is clear that the SC of the NiWO4 electrode decreased from 468 F g−1 (2 mV s−1) to 305 F g−1 (200 mV s−1). Lower scan rates allow H+ ions to thoroughly diffuse into the pores in the electrode material, which effectively increases the surface area available for redox reactions, whereas at higher scan rates this is limited to the outside surface of the electrode material, as a result of which the SC values decrease upon an increase in the scan rate.38
The CCV technique could be considered to be the best tool for monitoring the CV behavior and charge storage of a supercapacitor over time.39,40,54 In this method, during long-term potential cycling the stability of the electrode is assessed. CCV analysis was performed at 200 mV s−1 for 4000 cycles, and the results (SC retention vs. number of cycles) are shown in Fig. 12c. The cycling stability of the electrode increased by about 2.2% after 4000 cycles. Furthermore, it is evident that the considerable stability of the NiWO4 electrode, even at high scan rates, makes it a suitable candidate for applications that require fast charging. Fig. 12d shows three-dimensional (3D) CCV curves, which were recorded at a scan rate of 200 mV s−1. In these 3D plots, the changes in CV behavior during cycling are more noticeable.


3.7.2. Charge/discharge. 
Galvanostatic charge/discharge analyses were also conducted to evaluate the supercapacitive performance of the electrode. For this purpose, a two-electrode system was used. Fig. 13a illustrates the charge/discharge curves for the NiWO4 electrode in the potential window of −0.3 to 0.35 V at various current rates from 1 to 16 A g−1. The results reveal that the curves for the NiWO4 electrode are triangular, linear, symmetric and very sharp. The equal durations of charging and discharging for the electrode indicate reversible behavior, high coulombic efficiency, and ideal capacitive performance. The SC values were also calculated from the charge/discharge data using the following equation: (11)where I is the charge/discharge current (A), Δt is the discharge time (s), and V is the potential drop during discharge (V).
 Fig. 13  (a) Charge/discharge curves for the NiWO4 electrode at different charge/discharge current rates between −0.4 and 0.3 V in a 2.0 M H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte, (b) variations in SC at different current rates for the NiWO4 electrode, and (c) Ragone plot (power density vs. energy density) for the NiWO4 electrode. 
The SCs of the NiWO4 electrode according to the above equation were 411 F g−1 and 200 F g−1 at current rates of 1 A g−1 and 32 A g−1 (Fig. 13b), respectively, which were higher than those in other similar reports.55–57 As shown in Fig. 13c, the SC of the NiWO4 electrode retained 102.2% of its original value after 4000 cycles. Furthermore, the SC data and cycling stability values obtained from the charge/discharge tests on the electrode are in good agreement with the results of the CV and CCV measurements.
A Ragone plot (power density vs. energy density) for the NiWO4 electrode is shown in Fig. 13c. The energy and power densities were derived from the charge/discharge curves at various current rates, and these can be calculated by the following equations: (12) (13)
The NiWO4 electrode exhibited significant increases in both power and energy densities, with a maximum energy density of 36.6 W h kg−1 at a power density of 400 W kg−1, which is higher than other values reported in the literature.55–57 Upon an increase in power density, the energy density of this electrode decreased more sharply than that of other composite electrodes, which indicated that the number of available active sites in NiWO4 was higher. On the basis of the energy and power densities, NiWO4 was considered to be a suitable material for supercapacitor electrodes.


3.7.3. EIS studies. 
To compare the internal resistance of the electrode materials with the external resistance between the electrode and electrolyte, EIS tests were also conducted.58 The EIS measurements for NiWO4 were performed at the open-circuit potential (OCP) in the range of 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz (Fig. 14). Charge transfer between the electrode and electrolyte leads to a semicircular pattern in the Nyquist plot (imaginary part Z′ vs. real part Z′′) in the high-frequency region. This is followed by a tail caused by the diffusion of ions into the electrode at lower frequencies. Alternatively, it can be said that the electrochemical reaction impedance influences the size of the semicircle in such a way that a smaller semicircle radius corresponds to a lower charge transfer resistance.59
 Fig. 14  Nyquist plot for the NiWO4 electrode in the frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz and high-frequency part of Nyquist plot (inset). 
The low value of Rct for the NiWO4 electrode indicates that the electrochemical reaction at the interface between the electrode and electrolyte is more facile for this electrode material.60 According to the observed diameter of the semicircle, the calculated Rct value of the NiWO4 electrode is 1.3 Ω. In the low-frequency range, the Warburg tail corresponds to the capacitor's diffusive resistance of the electrolyte in the electrode pores and the diffusion of ions in the host material. However, the Nyquist plot is close to vertical, which implies that the electrochemical behavior of the electrode was similar to that of an ideal capacitor. The large Warburg region (the straight line) observed for the NiWO4 electrode indicates great variations in ion diffusion path lengths and an increased barrier to ion movement.58 The behavior of the electrode at high frequencies reflects the electrode series resistance (Rs) in the electrode/electrolyte system, which corresponds to both the characteristics of the electrolyte and the electrical resistance of the electrode.61 The Rs value of the NiWO4 electrode was determined from the intersection of the Nyquist plot. The calculated Rs value of the NiWO4 electrode was 0.28 Ω. The inset in Fig. 14 shows the expanded high-frequency region of the impedance plot.

4. Conclusion
The electrodeposition method was used and optimized for the preparation of NiWO4 NPs. The Taguchi robust design method was used to optimize the reaction parameters. The electrochemical method is a controllable and simple method that operates at low temperatures for the synthesis of NiWO4 NPs. This method has several advantages such as simplicity, low cost, high efficiency and purity of the product, which make it very easy to scale up the production of NPs. The results demonstrated that the concentration of tungstate ions and the applied voltage were the main parameters that affected the size of the NiWO4 NPs. The size of the NiWO4 NPs that were prepared under the optimum conditions was about 33 nm. NiWO4 NPs, as a photocatalyst, caused significant degradation of MO after irradiation with UV light for 100 min, with a conversion rate of 87%. Electrochemical measurements revealed that the NiWO4 electrode exhibited the best supercapacitive performance, with an SC of approximately 348 F g−1, at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1. The stability of the nanocomposite electrode was assessed by CCV at 200 mV s−1, which indicated that the SC of the NiWO4-based electrode remained at approximately 95.8% of its initial value after 4000 cycles. EIS and galvanostatic charge/discharge tests confirmed these findings, and hence NiWO4 is suggested to be a promising candidate for use in the construction of high-performance supercapacitor electrodes.
