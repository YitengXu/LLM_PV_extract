    , Accepted 7th September 2022First published on 7th September 2022AbstractWe present herein a series of AzaBenzannulated PDI (AzaBPDI) multimers, with their synthesis, characterizations and applications as non-fullerene acceptors in bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells. AzaBPDI dimers and trimer were prepared by a straightforward one-pot sequence of imine condensation, photocyclization and re-aromatization reactions from easily accessible aminoPDI and commercially available di- or trialdehydes, respectively. Their strong visible-light absorption and LUMO energy levels between −3.53 and −3.63 eV make them suitable electron acceptors for organic solar cells. When associated with the donor polymer PM6, we observed high device open-circuit voltages over 1.1 V, thus demonstrating that the AzaBPDI scaffold has the potential for delivering high performance fullerene-free photovoltaics.
Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ OSCs) have been widely investigated in the last few decades due to their low-cost solution processing, with potential applications in large-area, flexible and light-weight solar energy conversion. By incorporating a photoactive layer made of an electron–acceptor and an electron–donor blend, performances in OSCs are constantly being improved, with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) reaching over 19%.1–3 The introduction of novel conjugated small molecule electron-acceptors, such as non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs),4–8 has largely contributed to this progress, thanks to their excellent structural tunability compared to their fullerene counterparts.9 Perylenediimide (PDI) derivatives are among the most promising candidates and have been extensively investigated due to the combination of facile chemical modification, solution processibility, light and thermal stability, high electron affinity, strong visible light absorption, and the ability to form organized nanostructures in the film enabling rapid charge transport.10 The accessible PDI-based starting material, that is, 3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride, has allowed straightforward chemical modifications affording a large volume of materials with diverse electronic properties and solid-state morphologies.11 PDIs with varied functional groups have been investigated as NFAs in photovoltaic applications.12–15 Despite initially promising results, monomeric PDI acceptors suffer from overaggregation in the solid state, leading to large crystallites detrimental to exciton dissociation at the donor/acceptor interface, thus lowering the device performance.16,17 As an alternative, the introduction of bridged PDI multimers exhibiting a twisted conformation has led to improved device performances, as a result of more controlled phase separation into ordered domains of appropriate size with the BHJ photoactive layer.15,18,19 Therefore, connecting two or more PDI units is a straightforward approach to reduce intermolecular aggregation, mostly done by its connection at the bay position of the PDI core. Tuning the PDI at the bay site also effectively impacts the HOMO and LUMO distributions resulting in modified electrochemical properties.20 The most convenient and common way to functionalize the PDI bay positions relies on a sequence of bromination and palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. However, the introduction of halogen atoms can be tedious on a large scale, as it usually leads to a mixture of brominated, bis-brominated and non-reacted PDI that needs to be separated by column chromatography.21 The following coupling requires a precious catalyst and can produce toxic waste such as organotin derivatives when the popular Stille couplings are involved. In order to explore rylene-based NFAs that can be obtained in a more sustainable fashion, we describe herein the synthesis and spectroscopic and photovoltaic characterizations of four AzaBenzannulated PDI (AzaBPDI) dimers and trimer. Such heteroannulated perylenoids AzaBPDIs that are of particular interest22,23 were initially obtained in moderate yields by Wang and colleagues24 and then Würthner and colleagues25 using a Pictet–Spengler procedure between PDI-NH2 and an aldehyde requiring a large excess of a strong acid. We recently reported a visible-light mediated alternative26 which proceeded smoothly in high yields, even for the preparation of dimers and complex dyads.27 Recently, a modified version employing UV-light was extended to the preparation of BisAzaCoroneneDiimides explored as organic field-effect transistor (OFET) materials28 and aggregation-induced emission fluorescent probes.29 Nitrated PDI (PDI-NO2) could be obtained in high yields and short reaction times on a large scale with minimal or no purification required. The latter could be reduced quantitatively into the corresponding amine.30 Thus, the straightforward synthesis of AzaBPDI dimers/trimers and their evaluation as NFAs in organic solar cells make these materials particularly attractive and of great interest (Fig. 1). These new structures combine two factors that should improve the efficiency of solar cells: (i) the extension of the PDI that leads to a hypsochromic shift of the S0–S1 transition band, relative to the parent PDI, allowing nevertheless an increase of the absorption in the visible window, thanks to the charge-transfer band between the electro-photoactive linker and the AzaBPDI core; (ii) the construction of carbon–carbon (C–C) bonded dimers and trimers which should promote isotropic charge transport with increasing dimensionality and limiting aggregation of the monomeric PDI, expected to benefit the morphological properties of the blend; (iii) their synthesis does not require the use of a precious metal catalyst and does not generate organotin waste compared to the vast majority of PDI multimers prepared via Stille couplings.

Synthesis and characterization
Four electron-acceptors were designed and prepared by combining PDI-NH2 with simple and commercially available aldehydes (Scheme 1). Compound 1 was previously synthesized and characterized in our initial investigation of the visible-light mediated synthesis of AzaBPDIs.26 Thiophene and 2,2′-bithiophene were selected for their electron-rich character in order to prepare dimers (1 and 3) as well as triphenylamine to reach trimeric (2) systems. An expected charge-transfer phenomenon should increase their visible-light absorption range to be compared to the absorption range of compound 4 prepared using isophthalaldehyde. After imine formation in the presence of a catalytic trace of TFA in refluxing toluene, the intermediates were photocyclized by exposure to visible-light using white LEDs and subsequently treated with DDQ for re-aromatization. Notably, oxidation of the di-hydro intermediate can also be performed by simple exposure to ambient oxygen. Whereas compounds 1, 3 and 4 were obtained in good yields, the triphenylamine-centered trimer 2 was isolated in moderate yield due to the difficulty in separating it from the impurities resulting from partial condensation despite excellent conversion. All molecules exhibit good solubility in chlorinated solvents, THF and toluene, and were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and high-resolution mass spectrometry (Fig. S1–S9, ESI†). Thermogravimetric analysis revealed thermally stable compounds showing no decomposition below ∼380 °C (Fig. S10–S13, ESI†). Their optical and electronic properties were studied in CH2Cl2 solution by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry (CV). All compounds showed a strong absorption in the visible range between 350–400 and 550 nm in solution (Fig. 2a). The spectrum of acceptor 4 displays a vibronic progression typical of PDI-related dyes.10 Dimers 1 and 3, connected by a thiophene and a bithiophene linker, respectively, showed red-shifted spectra as a result of the charge transfer occurring from the electron-rich unit and one electron-poor AzaPDI unit. On the other hand, trimer 2 exhibited a weaker charge transfer band. Thin films were prepared by spin-coating on glass substrates. A significant spectral broadening was observed, and compounds 1, 2 and 3 showed an extension of their maximum absorption bands beyond 600 nm (Fig. 2b). The corresponding spectra of each acceptor in solution and thin film are shown in the ESI† (Fig. S14–S17).

 Fig. 2  Normalized absorption spectra of acceptors 1 (pink), 2 (brown), 3 (red) and 4 (orange) recorded in CH2Cl2 (top) and on films (bottom) prepared by spin-coating on glass substrates. 
Cyclic voltammograms were recorded in CH2Cl2 with 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 as the supporting electrolyte and ferrocene was used as an internal reference for the energy level estimation of frontier orbitals. No peaks were detected when scanning towards positive potentials. All acceptors revealed two reduction waves (Fig. S18–S20, ESI†) characteristic of the PDI scaffold with the successive formation of PDI− and PDI2− species. Compounds 1 and 3 turned out to have the highest electron affinities, with Ered11/2 at −1.17 and −1.14 V (vs. Fc+/Fc). These values shifted towards more negative potentials, at −1.25 and −1.27 V for compounds 2 and 4 with triphenylamine and phenyl linkers, respectively. From these experiments, LUMO and HOMO energy levels were extracted and are displayed in Table S1 (ESI†) and Fig. 3. Compared to 1-phenylPDI for which the maximum absorption was observed at 536 nm,31 these AzaBPDI derivatives showed a still strong but blue-shifted absorption (λmax = 475 nm for compound 1) combined with slightly destabilized LUMO energy levels.

Organic photovoltaic devices
A variety of dimeric and trimeric PDI materials have been previously employed as NFA components in the BHJ active layer of OSCs.32–34 To have an overview of the capability of the new AzaBPDI molecules as NFAs, we fabricated solar cells by mixing with the polymer PM6 in the conventional structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PM6:AzaBPDI/BCP/Ag (Fig. 3a).
The commonly used polymer donor PM6 was selected due to its suitable energy level, with HOMO and LUMO energy levels of 5.6 eV and 3.5 eV,35 respectively, which matches with the AzaBPDIs and forms a suitable cascade energy level to drive the charges to the corresponding electrodes, as shown in Fig. 3b. The chemical structures of the anode interlayer PEDOT:PSS, the polymer PM6 and the bathocuproine (BCP) cathode interlayer are shown in Fig. 3c. It is noteworthy that the PDI based NFAs are resistant to the deposition of the alcohol-based electron transport layer (ETL) solution of BCP, making these materials suitable for all solution-processed devices. We first investigated the absorption capabilities of these NFAs as thin films coupled with the polymer PM6. Fig. 4a presents the UV-vis absorption spectra of cast films of the polymer PM6 and the PM6:AzaBPDI BHJs. The polymer donor absorption was observed above 500 nm, while the acceptors absorb most strongly below 500 nm. This results in a broad absorption profile where the blend films absorb strongly across the entire visible spectrum. Moreover, the absorption spectrum of the blend was in agreement with the sum of the spectra of the individual components.

Photoluminescence (PL) quenching measurements were used to evaluate the exciton-dissociation efficiency in PM6:AzaBPDIs.36 Following excitation of PM6 at 600 nm,37 blends of all four materials showed that PL is quenched, as observed from the spectrum in Fig. 4b. PL quenching yields relative to the neat PM6 film are 64%, 54%, 72% and 66% for blend films with AzaBPDIs 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. These results indicate that the charge transfer is effective, but sub-optimal, between the donor and acceptor, and the OPV performance results from differences in charge recombination dynamics and possibly charge collection. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of devices based on PM6:AzaBPDIs and measured under calibrated AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 light intensity are shown in Fig. 4c, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1.

From these measurements, devices based on the blend of PM6 with AzaBPDIs 2 or 4 display an impressive open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.13 V and 1.11 V, with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 4.7 mA cm−2 and 4.8 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 36% and 35%, delivering a PCE of 1.9% and 1.8%, respectively. Devices based on PM6:AzaBPDI 1 which involves a thiophene connection between both PDI molecules deliver a similar PCE of 1.9%, with an increased FF of 44%, a JSC of 4.1 mA cm−2, and a slightly lower VOC of 1.07 V. Overall, the high VOC values achieved by these devices could be attributed to the high energy difference between the HOMO of the donor PM6 and the LUMO of the AzaBPDI NFAs, as well as the slight adjustment of the morphology by different AzaBPDI NFAs. In contrast, the device based on AzaBPDI 3 delivered slightly lower photovoltaic parameters between the four device structures, with a limited JSC of 3.2 mA cm−2 and a FF of 34%. The VOC of 0.97 V is lower compared to the other AzaBPDIs, but it is higher than that of typical devices made from PCBM.38 The JSC trend is corroborated by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the PM6:AzaBPDI based optimized devices, as shown in Fig. 4d. All the four blend films exhibited effective photoresponses over the entire absorption range between 300 and 700 nm. Importantly, the PDI acceptors are observed to contribute significantly to photon conversion efficiency at lower wavelengths (400–500 nm), suggesting that both the donor and acceptor contribute to the photocurrent. The maximum EQE value occurs in the range of 450–480 nm, with values of 25% for PM6:AzaBPDI 1 and PM6:AzaBPDI 2, 18% for PM6:AzaBPDI 3 and 28% for PM6:AzaBPDI 4. The integrated JSC values from the EQE are 4.2, 4.3, 3.1 and 4.9 mA cm−2 for the BHJs employing AzaBPDIs 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively, which are consistent with the JSC values obtained from J–V curves. Since the four blends absorb similarly, the differences observed in EQE and JSC must be due to changes in the efficiency of charge separation and charge collection in the PM6:AzaBPDI films.
X-Ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on BHJ films based on the AzaBPDIs and the results confirmed the amorphous nature of the films (Fig. S21 and S22, ESI†). The electron mobilities (μe) of the blends were measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method using ITO/ZnO/PM6:AzaBPDI/BCP/Ag (electron-only) devices. Mobilities of 5.33 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, 3.36 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, 1.19 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, and 4.79 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 were obtained for devices with AzaBPDIs 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. These values are comparable to some results reported in the literature for PDIs coupled with PM6.39,40 The higher electron mobility of PM6:AzaBPDI 1 is consistent with the increased FF for this structure compared to the other PDIs, and highlights that the limited PCE of the devices is partially due to the lower mobility of photogenerated charges in the BHJ.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to reveal the surface morphology and roughness of the neat PM6 and blend films. As depicted in Fig. 5a, the surface morphology of the PM6 film showed a distributed granular surface with a root mean square (RMS) roughness value of 1.2 nm. Seemingly small changes in the BHJ blend active layer morphology often play a significant role in OPV performance and result in changes in device efficiency. As shown in Fig. 5(b–e), all the four PM6:AzaBPDI blend films demonstrate a marked tendency to form very smooth surfaces, with RMS roughness of 1.1, 1.0, 1.4 and 1.3 nm for the BHJ formed by PM6 and AzaBPDI 1, AzaBPDI 2, AzaBPDI 3 and AzaBPDI 4, respectively. These data suggest that the surface morphology of the BHJ is similar to those of the four PDIs and the difference in performance is related to charge separation and transport in the BHJ rather than that at the interfaces. Even though the PDIs led to a higher VOC compared to state-of-the-art devices,12–15 the JSC and FF are lower than average, presumably due to the amorphous nature of the BHJ and low charge carrier mobility of the AzaBPDIs.

Conclusions
Herein four AzaBPDI multimers as non-fullerene electron acceptors (NFAs) for BHJ organic solar cells were reported. They all showed strong visible light absorption and low lying LUMO energy levels although of slightly higher energy than those of their PDI counterparts. Combined with a PM6 polymer donor and a bathocuproine electron transport layer in a conventional architecture and all solution processed organic solar cells, they exhibit an impressive VOC, higher than 1.10 V for blends using AzaBPDI acceptors 2 and 4. Since no strong morphology differences were observed and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra revealed a balanced contribution of the acceptors and the donor polymers, the charge separation and transport seemingly are the key factors holding back the performances of these systems. The introduction of more adequate imide-chains or the grafting of additional functionalities in the remaining free bay positions of these acceptors could help tune these parameters. Overall the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) attained here are still of interest considering that AzaBPDIs have never been previously introduced as NFAs and can be obtained using a straightforward synthetic strategy.
