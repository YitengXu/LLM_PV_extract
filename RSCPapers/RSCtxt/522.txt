    , Accepted 26th October 2018First published on 30th October 2018AbstractThe soft-chemistry synthetic routes of anatase phases for energy conversion and storage usually employ expensive and air-sensitive amorphous alkoxides, which hardly access the electrochemically active cationic vacancy defects in the cationic donor-substituted anatase compositions. Here we demonstrate an innovative way of using layered K3Ti5NbO14 as a cost-effectively crystalline precursor to synthesize cation-deficient Nb-doped TiO2 (NTO, formulated as Ti0.8Nb0.16□0.04O2) anatase by a one-pot hydrothermal route. When used as an anode in lithium ion batteries, the NTO electrode displayed initial discharge and charge capacities of 618 and 384.6 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.2C respectively, with a remarkable discharge capacity of ∼246.8 mA h g−1 retained after 100 cycles, representing the highest value among those reported for Nb-doped TiO2 anatases at low current density. A discharge capacity of 137.1 mA h g−1 was obtained even at a high current density of 2C. A full cell, fabricated using the NTO electrode as the anode and a commercial LiCoO2 cathode, is shown to deliver a discharge capacity of 220.2 mA h g−1 after 57 cycles, which exceeds those of most previously reported full cells based on the TiO2 anode and makes this NTO material a promising anode candidate for LIBs. These results present a practical synthetic strategy for tuning cationic vacancies through aliovalent cationic substitution to improve the electrochemical performance of actual LIBs and possibly to develop further relevant devices.
Introduction
Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been intensively utilized as a type of clean energy source in portable electronics and also show promising applications in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), electric vehicles (EVs), and smart grids.1 Currently, the anode materials in commercial LIBs are dominated by graphite, which is cost-efficient but short on capacity. This drawback impels the development of new substitutive anode materials with high capacity, low cost and sustainability for LIBs. In the past several decades, the transition metal oxide TiO2, in the form of different polymorphs,2 has received intensive attention3 owing to its advantages such as low cost, abundance in nature, environmental friendliness, cycling stability, and negligible volume expansion during Li-ion insertion–extraction processes.4–7 Among the three natural forms of TiO2,2 the electrochemical properties of anatase and rutile have widely been investigated thanks to their accessibility,8–11 while anatase has received more interest in LIBs due to its higher reversible capacity, broader Li+ migration pathways, and smaller initial capacity loss compared with the rutile polymorph.
However, the application of TiO2 as anodes in LIBs is severely hindered by its limited rate capabilities resulting from its poor electronic conductivity (10−13 S cm−1) induced by its wide band gap (3.0 eV for anatase and 3.2 eV for rutile)12 as well as the sluggish lithium-ion diffusion (10−10 to 10−17 cm2 S−1).13–15 Considerable research endeavour has been devoted to enhancing the electrochemical performance of TiO2. One typical approach to shorten the Li+ diffusion length and facilitate Li+ transport is morphology control, which includes developing nanoparticles and micro/nano-structures, e.g. nanotubes,16 nanocubes,17 nanorods18 and porous hierarchical structures.3,11,19,20 Another effective strategy is to improve the electronic conductivity of TiO2 through combination with highly conductive agents such as carbon materials17,21,22 or doping with alien atoms. The latter doping approach not only benefits electron transfer, but also offers more open channels in a specific direction for Li+ diffusion owing to the modification in the TiO2 lattice.23,24 This was evidenced by the improvement of capacity and rate capability from the cationic vacancies that are created by aliovalent anionic (e.g. F− and OH−) substitution in anatase.25 However, doping or substitution usually causes heterogeneous impurity defects, often followed by a decrease of thermal stability.26
Recently, Nb-doped TiO2 anatase (NTO) has attracted considerable attention owing to its prominent electronic conductivity induced by the donor-doping nature of Nb.27–31 It shows promising anodic electrochemical performance in LIBs,5 as well as dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)31 and supercapacitors.32 The enhanced electronic conductivity of NTO anatase could stem from the injection of additional 4d electrons from the donor dopant Nb into the conduction band of the Ti host, which may lead to metallic conduction behaviour when NTO anatase is grown as a transparent film by pulsed laser deposition (PLD).30 NTO anatase, which shows high electronic conductivity, may also be accessible via soft chemistry routes, which allow the formation of various micro–nano structures for achieving high electrochemical performance in LIBs. For example, 10 mol% Nb-doped anatase nanofibers synthesized by the electrospinning route have been reported to show higher rate capability in electrochemical cycling than the pristine materials,33 and 25 mol% Nb-doped spherical anatase particles (less than 6 nm in diameter) obtained from a continuous hydrothermal reaction showed superior capacity retention at high current rates compared to the undoped TiO2.32
The soft-chemistry synthetic routes of anatase phases usually require amorphous precursors derived from expensive and air-sensitive alkoxides.27 Such synthetic routes hardly access the electrochemically active cationic vacancy defects in the cationic donor-substituted anatase compositions, which have a stability advantage over the cation-deficient anatase phases obtained through the anionic substitution.25,34 Here we demonstrate an innovative route for using the layered complex oxide K3Ti5NbO14 (ref. 35) as a cost-effective crystalline precursor in the hydrothermal synthesis to prepare the nanostructured cation-deficient NTO anatase via a simple one-pot reaction with successive protonation and dehydration steps in the presence of acetic acid. The negatively charged Ti5NbO14 layers in the precursor contain similar octahedral units to those observed in anatase, which offers the opportunity for forming anatase via structural rearrangement when the interlayer cations are replaced by H+ and further followed by a dehydration process in a hydrothermal environment. The resulting NTO powder exhibited a mixture of microrods and nanocubes and demonstrated a significant enhancement of both the capacity and rate capability when compared with the previously reported Nb-doped anatases.32,33 The correlations among the synthetic route, microstructure, electronic conduction and electrochemical performance for the NTO anatase are then discussed in terms of defect chemistry. The results present a practical synthetic strategy for preparing cation-doped metal oxide materials with cationic vacancies for excellent electrochemical performance and complement the understanding of the interplay between defect chemistry and electrochemical properties of anatase materials.
Experimental and computational methods
Synthesis
Layered oxide K3Ti5NbO14 precursors were synthesized via a high-temperature solid-state reaction method using analytical-grade K2CO3 (99%, Aladdin), TiO2 (99%, Aladdin), and Nb2O5 (99.99%, Aladdin) as starting materials, which were weighed according to the correct stoichiometry and mixed thoroughly in an agate mortar. The mixtures were then fired at 900 °C for 24 h, leading to the K3Ti5NbO14 precursors for hydrothermal reaction in acetic acid solution. Different concentrations of acetic acid, ranging from 0.5 M to 17.4 M (i.e. pure acetic acid) and various reaction durations were tested for optimizing the synthesis conditions of Nb-doped anatase. In a typical synthesis of Nb-doped anatase TiO2, a ∼0.1 g K3Ti5NbO14 powder sample was dispersed in 30 ml of 0.5 M acetic acid aqueous solution under vigorous stirring for 20 min. The suspension was then transferred into a 50 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 2 to 96 h. After cooling down to ambient temperature, the precipitate was washed and filtered several times using distilled water until the pH value of the filtrate reached 7, and then dried at 60 °C for 12 h. The resulting samples were thermally treated at 500 °C in air for 2 h prior to the electrochemical performance testing. In order to examine whether the Nb-doped TiO2 anatase could also be obtained via dehydration of the protonated layered oxides under ambient pressure, ionic exchange of K+ with H+ for K3Ti5NbO14 was also performed in a 0.5 M acetic acid aqueous solution under stirring for 1–7 days at ambient temperature. The dehydration of the resulting protonated powders was investigated by in situ X-ray diffraction at various temperatures.
Characterization
The phase formation in the powder samples was examined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), which was performed on a PANalytical X'pert Powder diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation in a Bragg–Brentano geometry. The variable temperature X-ray diffraction (VT-XRD) data were collected over the 2θ range of 8–80° for ∼11 min at each temperature with set points ranging from 25 °C to 800 °C or 1100 °C. For in situ XRD study during the LIB charge/discharge process, an electrochemical cell model with a beryllium window was used, while the electrode slurry was directly coated on the beryllium window. Neutron powder diffraction (NPD) data were collected on a BT1 diffractometer at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (USA) using a wavelength of λ = 1.5397 Å. Rietveld refinements were performed using Topas-Academic software.36 The morphologies of the samples were examined using a Hitachi S4800 field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM). Prior to SEM examinations, gold was sprayed on the pellet surface to form a thin conducting layer. The bulk compositions of the samples were analysed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), which was performed on the samples without any gold coating as the energy edge of Au(M) (2.123 keV) is close to that of Nb(L) (2.166 keV). A Philips CM20 transmission electron microscope (TEM) was used for bright field imaging and electron diffraction (ED). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were collected at room temperature on a Thermo Fisher Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer under 1 × 10−10 mbar vacuum. During the XPS analysis, an Al Kα X-ray beam was chosen as the excitation source and the power was set to 250 W. The bonding energy was calibrated with reference to the C 1s peak (284.8 eV). Thermogravimetry (TG) analysis was performed on a PerkinElmer STA-8000 Simultaneous Thermal Analyzer with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 under nitrogen flow.
Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical performance measurements were carried out by employing CR2032 coin-type cells. The anode electrode was prepared by mixing 70 wt% of the as-prepared NTO anatase powder, 20 wt% of acetylene black and 10 wt% of polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF), which were all dissolved in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidine (NMP), coated on Cu foil and finally dried at 100 °C in a vacuum oven for 12 h. The mass loading of the active material on the electrode is about 2 mg cm−2. The CR2032 cell was assembled in an argon-filled glovebox (Mikrouna) with moisture and oxygen concentrations below 0.1 ppm. Pure lithium foil was used as a counter and reference electrode, and a micro-porous membrane (Celgard 2400) was used as the separator. The electrolyte consisted of 1 M LiPF6 dissolved in a 1:1 v/v mixture of ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate. The full battery was assembled by using the as-synthesized NTO as the anode material and commercial LiCoO2 as the cathode material. The cycle performance of the commercial LiCoO2 was examined by using a CR2032 half-cell. The galvanostatic charge/discharge performance was tested on a Neware battery testing system at room temperature. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed on a Solartron SI1287 Electrochemical Interface. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted by using a Solartron 1260 Impedance/Grain-Phase Analyzer combined with a Solartron 1287 Electrochemical Interface from 105 Hz to 0.1 Hz with an amplitude voltage of 5 mV.
Band structure calculation
Density Functional Theory (DFT) based band structure calculation was performed using the CASTEP program implemented in the Materials Studio software package and employing the ultra-soft pseudo-potential method.37 The geometry optimization was performed on a 4 × 3 × 1 supercell with the P1 space group with a 2 × 3 × 3 Monkhorst–Pack k-point grid. The interactions between ions and electrons were described by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA).38 Valence electrons of Ti 3s23p63d14s2, Nb 4s24p64d45s1 and O 2s22p4 were considered and the plane-wave energy cutoff was set to 500 eV.
Results
Transformation from layered K3Ti5NbO14 to anatase NTO
The XRD pattern (Fig. 1a and S1a†) of K3Ti5NbO14 synthesized at 900 °C for 24 h and the related Rietveld refinement (Fig. S1b†) confirm a layered monoclinic single phase for K3Ti5NbO14.35 The refined cell parameters of K3Ti5NbO14 are a = 18.361(5) Å, b = 3.791533(9) Å, c = 9.1907(2) Å, and β = 101.207(2)°. The time-dependent transformation from the layered K3Ti5NbO14 structure to the anatase phase in the hydrothermal reaction with 0.5 M acetic acid was then ex situ examined by both XRD and SEM experiments. XRD data (Fig. 1) show that a layered phase is present within the first 24 h. The (001) reflection position (2θ) increased from 9.84° to 10.02° (Fig. 1b), which can be attributed to the protonation of K3Ti5NbO14via exchange of K+ with H+ to form H3Ti5NbO14, which has a smaller interlayer distance along the c axis compared with K3Ti5NbO14. The (001) reflection position in the products from the 2–24 h reactions remained essentially unchanged, indicating that K3Ti5NbO14 can be fully protonated within the first 2 h under hydrothermal conditions. Apart from the protonation, dehydration was also observed, as indicated by the existence of the anatase phase as a minor secondary phase in the product after 2 h of hydrothermal reaction, which slowly became a dominant phase with the increase of reaction duration. The layered phase almost disappeared when the reaction time exceeded 48 h, and the product became a single-phase anatase at 96 h, implying that the dehydration and structural transformation from the layered structure to the anatase phase are much slower than the protonation process.

The SEM images also show interesting crystal-shape evolution along the crystalline phase evolution identified by XRD. Micrometer-sized long planar-column and rod-like morphologies were observed for K3Ti5NbO14 and the product (Fig. 1c and d) right from short-time hydrothermal reactions. These morphologies are consistent with the layered feature of the precursor. When the reaction time was increased to 24 h, nano-scale cube-like particles appeared and accumulated on the planar column-like sample (Fig. 1e–g). These nanocrystals correspond to the growth of the anatase phase which breaks the column-like particles into cubic particles. Finally, the phase-pure anatase powder obtained from the 96 h reaction contains dominant cubic particles (Fig. 1h) although the column-like particles were still observable. EDS elemental analysis (Fig. S2a†) performed on the NTO anatase phase obtained after 96 h of hydrothermal reaction led to a cationic ratio of Ti0.81(1)Nb0.19(1) (versus Ti0.82(2)Nb0.18(2) for the layered precursor). This result confirms that the 2D octahedral layers in the precursor transformed into NTO anatase via dehydration. The EDS elemental mapping patterns (Fig. S2b†) suggest that Nb is uniformly distributed in the NTO samples. TG analysis (Fig. S3†) shows a ∼0.4% mass loss during heating from room temperature, before reaching constant weight at 600 °C, suggesting that there should be no apparent coordinated water in the NTO sample.
To elucidate the crucial role of the hydrothermal reaction in accessing NTO anatase from the layered K3Ti5NbO14 precursor, the ionic exchange of K+ with H+ in K3Ti5NbO14 was performed at ambient temperature and pressure. Ex situ XRD data (Fig. S4a†) confirm that the protonation of K3Ti5NbO14 took place at ambient temperature, as indicated by the 2θ-position shift of the (001) reflection from 9.84° to 10.09° after a 7 day ion exchange (Fig. S4b†). The EDS elemental analysis confirms that the atomic percentage of K among all the cations was reduced to ∼4.1(4) mol% from 32.7(6) mol% in the precursor (Fig. S4c and S4d†). The protonated product recovered after the acetic acid treatment for 7 days still retains a rod/column-like shape of the K3Ti5NbO14 precursor (Fig. S5†), confirming that the protonation takes place topologically between the Ti/Nb octahedral layers in K3Ti5NbO14. The dehydration of the protonated product at elevated temperature under ambient pressure was monitored by in situ VT-XRD experiments. The VT-XRD data (Fig. S6†) collected on the 7 day acid-treated sample showed that the protonated sample could not transform into the anatase phase at high temperature. This observation implies that hydrothermal conditions are required to attain the anatase phase from the layered K3Ti5NbO14 precursor.
In order to study the effect of acetic acid concentration on the formation of NTO anatase under hydrothermal conditions, various concentrations of acetic acid were used in the hydrothermal reactions. Fig. 2 compares the XRD patterns of hydrothermal reaction products obtained after 24 h of reaction, using various concentrations of acetic acid. When 1 M acetic acid was used, the K3Ti5NbO14 layered phase almost transformed into NTO anatase with little protonated phase (Fig. S7†) after 24 h. When the concentration of acetic acid was increased to 5 M or 10 M, a pure phase of NTO anatase could be obtained within 24 h (Fig. S8 and S9†), indicating that a high concentration of acetic acid promotes the NTO anatase formation. However, compared to the 5 M case (Fig. S8†), a longer reaction duration is needed for a complete structural transformation from H3Ti5NbO14 to anatase under 10 M acetic acid conditions (Fig. S9†). And no anatase phase was formed when pure acetic acid (17.4 M) was used (Fig. S10†), indicating that a minimum amount of water is necessary to crystallize the NTO anatase. The above results indicate that acetic acid and water may play competing roles in the formation of NTO anatase during the hydrothermal reaction. Therefore there could be an optimum acetic acid concentration for the hydrothermal synthesis of NTO anatase. Among our different attempts, the 5 M concentration of acetic acid could provide the most favourable conditions to accelerate the formation of NTO anatase in the hydrothermal reaction. Further SEM examinations indicate that pure NTO anatase powder was obtained after a short reaction time (24 h) using a 5 M acetic acid solution. The sample then still contains many column-shaped particles (Fig. 3a) in addition to the usual nanocubes. TEM-EDS analysis indicates that both cubes and columns have similar compositions and TEM patterns show that the column particles are actually composed of small nanocube-like domains with clear domain boundaries (Fig. 3b). Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (Fig. 3c and d) confirm that both cubes and columns are crystalline and match with an anatase structure. It should be noted here that some tiny extra spots were observed in the SAED pattern (Fig. 3d), implying the occurrence of Nb/Ti ordering, which could be partial ordering of Nb in the octahedral Ti host in the layered K3NbTi5O14 precursor.35 However both XRD and NPD data of the NTO sample (shown in the Structure of NTO anatase section below) did not show additional reflections from the cation ordering, indicating that the Nb/Ti ordering could be a localised behaviour.

The thermal stability of NTO anatase was also investigated by in situ XRD experiments, which show that NTO anatase is stable up to 850 °C (Fig. S11†). The NTO anatase phase actually began to decompose at 900 °C, resulting in a monoclinic TiNb2O7 phase in addition to an anatase phase, which has a lower Nb content. The amount of TiNb2O7 in the mixture increased with temperature and remained unchanged within the 1050–1100 °C range, where the anatase phase converted to the thermally stable rutile phase. The phase formation remained unchanged upon cooling down to room temperature and the quantitative analysis performed by two-phase Rietveld refinement of XRD data (Fig. S12†) yielded values of ∼28.4 wt% TiNb2O7 and ∼71.6 wt% TiO2 rutile free of Nb. These contents are consistent with the cationic ratio of Ti5Nb in NTO anatase and suggest that all Nb atoms are precipitated from the NTO anatase and transferred to the monoclinic TiNb2O7 phase. These results also confirm that the NTO anatase is less thermally stable than TiO2 anatase.
Structure of NTO anatase
Prior to the structural analysis of the NTO anatase, the oxidation states of Nb and Ti in the NTO anatase were studied by XPS with Nb2O5 and TiO2 as reference materials, which help us to analyse the mechanism of Nb substitution for Ti and existence of cationic vacancies in the NTO anatase. Apart from the C 1s peak positioned at 283.9 eV, the XPS survey spectrum (Fig. S13†) confirmed the existence of only Ti, Nb, and O peaks in the NTO anatase sample. The Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks in NTO anatase (Fig. 4a) are symmetric and centred respectively at 457.88 eV and 463.68 with an energy separation of 5.8 eV, and are essentially identical to those observed in TiO2 and the values reported for Ti4+ (458.7 eV) in the literature.27,39 The Nb 3d spectrum of the NTO anatase (Fig. 4b) shows two peaks centred at 206.28 eV and 209.08 eV with an energy separation of 2.8 eV, corresponding to the Nb 3d5/2 and Nb 3d3/2 peaks, respectively, as observed in the Nb2O5 reference.40 Therefore, the oxidation states of Ti and Nb in the NTO anatase are mainly 4+ and 5+, respectively, which is consistent with the white colour observed for the NTO anatase powder and its high resistivity described below. Thus, the NTO anatase phase obtained from hydrothermal reaction may be described as either an oxygen-hyperstoichiometric or cation-deficient phase.
 Fig. 4  XPS spectra of Ti 2p (a) and Nb 3d (b) from NTO, TiO2 (TO) and Nb2O5 (NO). 
Given that there is no favourable space to accommodate interstitial oxide anions in the anatase structure, a cation-deficient structure containing disordered Nb and Ti cations was considered for the NTO anatase. Such a model would be in accordance with the enhanced lithium storage described in the Electrochemical performance section below. According to the Ti5Nb cationic compositions, this cation-deficient NTO anatase material can be described with Ti0.8Nb0.160.04O2 stoichiometry, corresponding to 4% of cationic vacancies in the anatase structure. Although the XRD and NPD techniques enable distinguishing Nb from Ti due to the large contrast in their atomic numbers and the respective negative and positive neutron scattering lengths for Ti (−3.438 fm) and Nb (7.054 fm),41 Rietveld refinements of such a low amount of cationic vacancies remain challenging. Combined NPD and XRD refinements using the same atomic site parameters were initially performed. When the occupancies of both Ti and Nb were freely refined, a full occupancy on the cationic site with a Ti/Nb ratio of 6.1(1) was obtained, which is inconsistent with the expected cationic ratio. The cation occupancies were then refined with constraints on the maximal occupancies of Ti (5/6) and Nb (1/6) according to the nominal Ti/Nb ratio. This strategy indeed yielded values of ∼2.2% of cationic vacancies although they are lower than the expected value and the refined Ti/Nb ratio 5.8(1) is still higher than the proposed stoichiometry. The Ti and Nb occupancies were further refined with the charge neutrality constraint according to the Ti4+ and Nb5+ oxidation states revealed by the XPS data. This yielded results of 3.8(5)% of cationic vacancies and a Ti/Nb ratio of 5.3(1), close to the expected values. As the combined refinements cause compromise on the fits to both NPD and XRD data, this cation-deficient structure was finally refined on NPD and XRD data separately in order to compare the site deficiencies obtained when the best fit was achieved for each data. Both refinements gave nearly the same site occupancies and therefore cation deficiency, except for the relatively larger atomic displacement parameters (Biso ∼ 2.7–2.9 Å2) from the XRD data compared with that from NPD data (Biso ∼ 0.36–0.75 Å2). Given the fact that NPD data were collected from a large number of samples and contain more observed peaks in the high angle range than XRD data, here we report the final refined structural parameters from the NPD data refinement, as shown in Table 1. Fig. 5 shows Rietveld refinement plots of the NPD and XRD data of the NTO sample.

Electrochemical performance
The electrochemical performance of the as-synthesized NTO material for LIB applications was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) using CR2032 coin-type half cells. Fig. 6a shows the first three CV curves of the NTO anode at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s−1. As shown in Fig. 6a, in the initial sweep, the cathodic peak voltage at around 1.41 V corresponds to Li ion insertion in the NTO structure, and the anodic peaks located at around 1.69 V and 2.04 V are attributed to Li ion extraction from the NTO structure. This is a typical electrochemical insertion/extraction process, similar to the one previously reported for the pristine or Nb-doped anatase TiO2.33 In the second cycle, the cathodic peak potential is shifted to about 1.56 V. The second and third cycles are almost overlapping, indicating a good reversibility of the electrodes based on the NTO anatase. Fig. 6b shows the charge/discharge voltage profiles of the TNO electrode for the first, second and tenth cycles measured at a current density of 0.2C (1C = 170 mA h g−1). The charge/discharge voltage profiles of the first cycle show a pronounced reduction peak at 1.75 V and oxidation peaks at 1.65 and 1.92 V, which agree well with the aforementioned CV results. The initial discharge and charge capacities of the NTO electrode are 618 and 384.6 mA h g−1, respectively, corresponding to a coulombic efficiency of 62.2%. The coulombic efficiency increased to 98% after several cycles. The large capacity loss in the first cycle is mainly attributed to the decomposition of the electrolyte and the formation of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer, which are common to most of the lithium ion intercalation electrode materials.10,25,42 Discharge and charge capacities of 418.2 and 357.7 mA h g−1 were obtained in the second cycle, giving rise to a high coulombic efficiency of about 85%. The discharge capacity is retained at about 246.8 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles, at a current density of 0.2C (Fig. 6c). This represents the highest value among those reported for Nb-doped TiO2 anatases at low current density while the overall performance is comparable to that of other Nb-doped TiO2 and F−, OH− doped TiO2 anatases (Table 2). To evaluate the rate capability of the as-prepared NTO electrodes, galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling measurements were carried out from 0.2C to 2C. As shown in Fig. 6d, the discharge capacity decreases with gradual increase of current density, and average discharge capacities of 386.8, 244, 190.7, and 137.1 mA h g−1 could be delivered at current rates of 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2C, respectively. Even after cycling at high current rates, a capacity of 313.5 mA h g−1 was retained when the current rate was reduced back to 0.2C.

In order to reveal the transport kinetics for excellent electrochemical performance of the NTO electrode, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out at the open circuit. The Nyquist plots of impedance data for commercial anatase TiO2 and NTO electrodes are presented in Fig. S14.† All of the Nyquist plots contain a semicircle in the high frequency region, which could be assigned to charge-transfer impedance, and a straight inclined line in the low frequency region, which corresponds to the semi-infinite diffusion of the Li-ions in the electrode.43–45 Apparently, the diameter of the semicircle for the NTO electrode in the high-frequency region is significantly smaller than that of commercial anatase TiO2. This indicates that the NTO electrode possesses lower charge transfer impedance, which could lead to rapid electron transport during the electrochemical charge–discharge process.
To evaluate this new NTO electrode for practical utilization in LIBs, a full cell was fabricated using the NTO as the anode and the commercial LiCoO2 as the cathode, denoted as NTO//LCO. Prior to the full cell testing, the cycle performance of the LiCoO2 electrode (Fig. S15†) was examined at a current density of 0.1C: the initial charge and discharge capacities were 146 and 144.9 mA h g−1, respectively, with a coulombic efficiency of 99.2%; these capacities and coulombic efficiency were retained essentially unchanged after ten cycles, confirming the excellent cycle performance of the LiCoO2 electrode. The CV and voltage–capacity curves of the NTO//LCO full cell are shown in Fig. S16.† In the CV curves (Fig. S16a†), the broad anodic peaks located at around 2.3 V are attributed to Li ion extraction from LiCoO2, and the cathodic peak voltage at around 2.24 and 1.82 V corresponds to Li ion insertion in the NTO structure. The voltage–capacity curves (Fig. S16b†) indicate that the working potential of the NTO//LCO full cell is about 2.3 V, which matches well the CV result and the voltage difference between the half-cell charge–discharge plateaus for the positive (Fig. S16a†) and negative (Fig. 6b) electrodes. Initially the NTO//LCO full cell displayed charge and discharge capacities of 248.5 and 215.8 mA h g−1, respectively, and the corresponding coulombic efficiency was 86.8% (Fig. 6e). In the second cycle, the NTO//LCO full cell could achieve charge and discharge capacities of 228.4 and 224.2 mA h g−1 with a coulombic efficiency of 98.2%. After the second cycle, the coulombic efficiency remained higher than 98%. The NTO//LCO full cell could deliver a discharge capacity of 220.2 mA h g−1 after 57 cycles, and could light a red light-emitting diode (LED) lamp (inset of Fig. 6e) after fifteen cycles. The observed capacity retention value is higher than most of the previously reported data of full cells based on TiO2 anodes (Fig. 6f and Table S1†).27 Even at a higher current density of 0.5C, the NTO//LCO full cell could display a discharge capacity of 184.5 mA h g−1 after 114 cycles (Fig. S16c†).

In situ XRD patterns of the NTO electrode were collected during galvanostatic charge and discharge at 0.1C (Fig. 7) to further gain insight into the structural evolution of the NTO anode during charging and discharging. During the discharge process, (011)A and (013)A diffraction peaks (the subscript “A” denotes anatase) of the anatase phase, respectively located at 25.07° and 36.76°, became weakened and broadened. They gradually turned back into sharp peaks at the end of the charging process, indicating reversible Li ion intercalation and de-intercalation processes in the anatase phase. Two new peaks located at ∼24° and ∼39.45° can be observed during charging and discharging processes, which are indexed to the (011)O and (004)O reflections of the orthorhombic Li0.5TiO2 phase (the subscript “O” denotes orthorhombic) and is linked to the insertion of Li ions. Based on these in situ XRD results, it can be concluded that the as-prepared Nb-doped anatase TiO2 is robust enough to tolerate Li ion insertion and extraction, in agreement with previous literature reports.9,55 The NTO electrode phase during the charge/discharge process was also studied by ex situ XRD after the 20th and even 50th cycles at a current density of 0.2C. The XRD patterns shown in Fig. S17† indicate that the anatase phase is retained for the NTO electrode after 20 and 50 cycles, demonstrating the high phase stability of the anatase NTO electrode during the charge–discharge cycling process.

(Right) The crystal structure schemes illustrate the crystal structure evolution during the charge and discharge processes. The subscript letters “O” and “A” under the Miller indices represent the orthorhombic Li0.5TiO2 (O) or tetragonal anatase (T) phase, respectively. 
Discussion
The synthesis of the doped and undoped anatase phases was previously performed from amorphous precursors via hydrothermal reaction. In the present study, nanostructured NTO anatase was synthesized from a layered complex oxide precursor, K3Ti5NbO14, under hydrothermal conditions via successive protonation and dehydration steps in a one-pot reaction. The structural transformation from the layered structure to the three-dimensional anatase is possible given their structural resemblance. Fig. 8 compares the structures of the layered K3Ti5NbO14 (ref. 35) and anatase8 phases. The octahedral linkages in both K3Ti5NbO14 and anatase are mixed corner- and edge-sharing. In K3Ti5NbO14, the two-dimensional octahedral layers consist of one-dimensional M6O14 units (highlighted by blue dashed ellipsoids, M = Ti, Nb) that are assembled via shifting along the a-axis, forming a zig-zag octahedral layered network along the c-axis. The one-dimensional M6O14 unit is composed of two octahedral sheets (in blue and yellow in the blue ellipsoid) with a depth of three edge-sharing octahedra along the c-axis, which is referred to as a 2 × 3 unit. These two sheets are linked with each other via edge-sharing and the octahedra within each sheet are corner-shared along the b-axis (Fig. 8b). Shifting the one-dimensional unit along the a-axis breaks the edge-sharing octahedral linkage into corner-sharing between the neighbouring one-dimensional units along the c-axis (highlighted by the red ellipsoid and Fig. 8c). Such corner-sharing linkage between the one-dimensional M6O14 units along the c-axis leads to the formation of another type of one-dimensional unit in the layered K3Ti5NbO14 that consists of two octahedral sheets (in blue and yellow in the red ellipsoid) with a depth of two edge-sharing octahedra along the a-axis, which is referred to as a 2 × 2 unit, while the anatase structure is composed of two-dimensional corner-sharing octahedral layers, which are linked with each other along the c-axis via sharing the edges of adjacent octahedra (Fig. 8d). The cationic sublattices in the neighbouring layers (perpendicular to the c-axis) are shifted alternatively along the a and b axes by a step of an M–O bond length to form a three-dimensional network (Fig. 8d–f). The one-dimensional 2 × 2 units that are formed in the boundaries between the 3 × 2 units in the layered K3Ti5NbO14 are the same as those observed in the two consecutive layers in anatase (Fig. 8e and f). Therefore, the structural transformation from the layered K3Ti5NbO14 to the three-dimensional anatase structure takes place via significant structure rearrangement during dehydration of the protonated layered structure in the hydrothermal reaction, which probably requires breaking the one-dimensional unit through the central octahedral positions (Fig. 8a) and assembling the one-dimensional 2 × 2 units (Fig. 8c) into a three-dimensional network of anatase.
 Fig. 8  Structures of (a–c) layered K3Ti5NbO14 and (d–f) anatase: (b) and (c) illustrate the polyhedral linkage in the one-dimensional 3 × 2 and 2 × 2 units of layered K3Ti5NbO14 highlighted by blue and red ellipsoids, respectively. (e) and (f) illustrate the two-dimensional structural units in anatase highlighted by blue and red rectangles, respectively. 
The Ti4+ and Nb5+ oxidation states confirmed by both XPS measurements and the existence of cationic vacancies revealed by Rietveld analysis of both XRD and NPD data in the NTO anatase suggest that the substitution of Nb5+ atoms on Ti4+ sites is charge compensated by vacancies on Ti4+ sites according to the defect reaction . These results agree with previous results reported by Ruiz et al. on Nb-doped TiO2 nanoparticles56 but are in contrast to the electron compensation mechanism proposed for the metallic transparent Nb-doped anatase from the PLD method30 and the black Nb-doped anatase from a hydrothermal reaction using tetrabutyl titanate and niobium powder31 according to the reaction . The UV-vis light absorption spectra (Fig. S18†) indicate that the NTO anatase has a wide band gap of ∼3.48 eV. Band structure calculations for NTO anatase using the cation-deficient structure (Fig. S19a†) confirm that NTO anatase has a similar band structure (Fig. S19b†) to that of the undoped anatase (Fig. S19e†). Moreover, the intrinsic electronic conduction occurs via electron excitation from O-2p orbitals in the valence band maximum to the Ti-3d or Nb-4d orbitals in the conduction band minimum over the band gap (Fig. S19c and f†). This is unlike the metallic Nb-doped TiO2 anatase where the additional Nb-4d electrons occupy the conduction band minimum and can easily migrate in the conduction bands (Fig. S19g–i†).57 Therefore, the Nb substitution for Ti in the cation-deficient NTO anatase has a minor effect on the electronic conduction. The NTO anatase in the present study is too insulating to be measured for an accurate conductivity at room temperature.
The good electrochemical lithium storage properties, i.e. high capacity, stable cycling performance and good rate capacity, observed on the new NTO anatase presented here can be ascribed to the cationic deficiency in the NTO structure. The cationic vacancies could offer not only more active sites for Li ion insertion and extraction, which led to higher observed capacity than the theoretical capacity of anatase TiO2,58 but also additional Li+ diffusion routes which enhance the mobility of Li ions and the rate capability. Although the capacity and rate capability at high current density remain limited compared to those of F− and OH− doped TiO2 anatases containing Ti vacancies,25,34 the Nb-doped anatase has the advantage of thermal stability over the anion-doped materials. Therefore, the strategy of tuning cationic vacancies through aliovalent cationic substitution could be practical for controlling the electrochemical performance of LIBs and other relevant devices.
Conclusion
In summary, cation-deficient Nb-doped TiO2 anatase Ti0.8Nb0.16□0.04O2 was synthesized by a one-pot hydrothermal route from a layered oxide K3Ti5NbO14 precursor. The hydrothermal reaction consists of successive protonation and dehydration steps in the presence of acetic acid, which led to a significant structural rearrangement from the layered K3Ti5NbO14 to the three-dimensional anatase structure. Owing to cationic deficiency in the NTO anatase structure, the NTO anatase as an anode for LIBs demonstrates enhanced lithium storage compared with undoped TiO2 anatase and shows overall excellent electrochemical performance with high capacity, stable cycling performance and good rate capacity among the reported rutile, anatase and brookite TiO2-based anodes. The new NTO electrode displays a high reversible capacity of 246.8 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 0.2C, giving the highest value among those reported for Nb-doped TiO2 anatases at low current density. At a high current density of 2C, the NTO anatase still displays good rate performance with a retention capacity of 137.1 mA h g−1. A full cell fabricated using the NTO electrode as the anode and a commercial LiCoO2 electrode as the cathode can deliver a discharge capacity of 220.2 mA h g−1 after 57 cycles, exceeding those of most previously reported full cells based on the TiO2 anode. Therefore, the NTO electrode with good electrochemical performance holds promise for rechargeable LIBs. Our results present a practical synthetic strategy for preparing other aliovalent cation doped metal oxide materials with cationic vacancies for excellent electrochemical performance in LIBs and other relevant devices.
