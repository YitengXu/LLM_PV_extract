    , Accepted 18th February 2019First published on 18th February 2019AbstractCarbon dioxide (CO2) significantly contributes to global warming. To effectively remedy the CO2 emission and simultaneously meet the global energy demand, CO2 photoreduction to solar fuels has been considered as one of the promising approaches. However, the post-use of the hydrocarbons generated by the CO2 photoreduction usually suffers from low yield and poor selectivity. In this work, therefore, we develop an integrated system consisting of CO2 photoreduction with 3D TiO2/Ni-foam and a photocatalytic fuel cell for direct power generation. Such an integration allows the generated hydrocarbons by the CO2 photoreduction to be directly used as fuels for the photocatalytic fuel cell, realizing direct power by generation using CO2. Moreover, the 3D TiO2/Ni-foam as the photocatalyst for the CO2 photoreduction can provide a large surface area for loading the photocatalyst and its highly porous structure can significantly enhance mass transport and avail light scattering, both of which facilitate the photocatalytic reaction of CO2 and thereby enhance power output. The results confirm that the use of CO2 for direct power generation is successfully enabled by this integrated system. This work not only demonstrates the feasibility of the integrated system for direct power generation but also provides a new avenue for effective CO2 utilization.
1. Introduction
Fossil fuels (coal, petroleum, natural gas, etc.) have long been the backbone of the world's energy supply to drive the development of society.1–3 However, due to the unsustainability of fossil fuels and the ever-increasing energy demand, the energy crisis started to occur in recent decades.4,5 On the other hand, due to the massive emission of CO2 from rapid depletion of fossil fuels, the CO2 level in the atmosphere has gradually risen, which deteriorates the living environment.6,7 Therefore, it is significantly desirable to design a suitable approach to simultaneously address the above-mentioned environment and energy issues.8,9 CO2 conversion into hydrocarbons by photoreduction, photoelectrochemical reduction, electrocatalysis, etc. has drawn great attention all over the world, because it not only recycles CO2 to fuels for continued use but also ameliorates the CO2 emission.10,11 Among the technologies for CO2 conversion, CO2 photoreduction to C1/C2 fuels (CH3OH, C2H5OH, HCOOH, etc.) has been considered as a promising approach due to the use of inexhaustible and clean solar energy, cheap photocatalysts and mild conditions.12–14
In CO2 photoreduction systems, semiconductors used as the photocatalysts generate photo-excited electron–hole pairs under illumination, by which CO2 is reduced into hydrocarbons. Because photocatalysts dominate the CO2 conversion, numerous efforts have been devoted to the development of high-performance photocatalysts for CO2 conversion. For instance, Kumar et al.15 developed a novel hybrid Ru(bpy)3/TiO2 photocatalyst synthesized via a grafting method. The prepared photocatalyst showed high performance for CO2 conversion to methanol under visible light irradiation. Adekoya et al.16 demonstrated that the g-C3N4/Cu/TiO2 composite was an effective photocatalyst for CO2 photoreduction because of the intensified electron–hole separation. Recently, Cheng et al.17 combined the advantages of optofluidics and a membrane reactor to build an optofluidic membrane microreactor with enhanced mass transport and uniform light distribution for CO2 photoreduction. Tahir et al.18 investigated CO2 photoreduction with H2 over Cu–In-doped TiO2 nanocatalysts in a monolith photoreactor and a higher performance than that of a batch-type reactor was achieved.
Although remarkable progress has been made to CO2 photoreduction, the yield of hydrocarbons is still low, generally lower than ∼1 mmol per g cat per h,19 making the follow-up utilization of the generated hydrocarbons difficult. For example, a series of extractions and concentrations of the generated hydrocarbons are required for the post-use.20,21 As a consequence, an effective way to appropriately use the products of CO2 photoreduction is immediately needed. To address this critical issue, we developed an integrated system consisting of a CO2 photoreduction reactor with Ni-foam supported TiO2 (termed 3D TiO2/Ni-foam) interconnected to a photocatalytic fuel cell (PFC) for direct power generation by utilizing CO2.
As illustrated in Fig. 1a, this novel system consists of a CO2 photoreduction reactor with a 3D TiO2/Ni-foam as the photocatalyst and a downstream PFC, which are integrated on a chip. The exit of the CO2 photoreduction reactor is directly interconnected with the inlet of the PFC. In the PFC, a TiO2 photoanode is fabricated on FTO glass while a Pt/carbon paper air-breathing cathode for passively transporting the oxygen from ambient air proceeds the reduction of O2. In principle, CO2-saturated sulfuric acid solution is supplied to the CO2 photoreduction chamber with the 3D TiO2/Ni-foam. Under light irradiation, the electrons in the photocatalyst are excited from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB), and the holes are correspondingly generated at the VB, as indicated by reaction (1) hν + TiO2 = e− + h+(1)
 Fig. 1  (a) The working principle of the integrated system for electricity generation; (b) the exploded view and (c) the picture of the integrated system. 
The electrons in the CB exhibit strong reduction ability so methanol or/and ethanol and other organics can be generated by CO2 photoreduction. Taking methanol as an example, the photocatalytic reactions can be indicated by reactions (2) and (3), CO2 + 6H+ + 6e− = CH3OH + H2O(2) 2H2O + 4h+ = O2 + 4H+(3)
Then, the generated hydrocarbons flow to the downstream PFC, in which they are photoelectrochemically oxidized to generate electricity. The photoanode and cathode reactions are indicated by reactions (4) and (5) CH3OH + H2O + 6h+ = CO2 + 6H+(4) 4H+ + O2 + 4e− = 2H2O(5)
Through the above-mentioned processes, the products of CO2 photoreduction can be directly used as fuels for the downstream PFC to generate electricity, realizing CO2 utilization for direct power generation.
Such an integration of CO2 photoreduction using 3D TiO2/Ni-foam with a PFC offers several advantages. First of all, the integrated PFC can directly use the products of CO2 photoreduction to generate electricity,22–25 making it perfect for the integration with CO2 photoreduction. Moreover, the photo-excited holes have strong oxidation ability, so the problem of product selectivity encountered in conventional fuel cells can be eliminated even with low concentration. Additionally, most of the reported photocatalysts for CO2 photoreduction have a two-dimensional (2D) planar structure.26,27 To improve the photocatalytic efficiency, three-dimensional (3D) photocatalysts have emerged.28–30 The 3D TiO2/Ni-foam proposed in this work can provide not only a large surface area for loading the photocatalyst but also a highly porous structure for enhancing mass transport and availing light scattering. These unique features benefit the enhancement of CO2 photoreduction for subsequent power generation by the PFC. Therefore, the newly developed integrated system shows promising potential for CO2 utilization.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of the 3D TiO2/Ni-foam photocatalyst
In this work, the preparation of the 3D TiO2/Ni-foam photocatalyst consisted of two steps: the synthesis of a compact TiO2 layer on the Ni-foam surface and the coating of a TiO2 thin film on the compact TiO2 layer. As mentioned above, the Ni-foam as the catalyst skeleton can provide a large surface area for loading the photocatalyst and its highly porous structure can avail light scattering and enhance mass transport, both of which facilitate CO2 photoreduction. The compact TiO2 layer on the Ni-foam can strengthen the adhesion between the TiO2 thin film and the Ni-foam to eliminate catalyst shedding. Moreover, the compact TiO2 layer can prevent the corrosion of the Ni-foam in sulfuric acid by providing a protective cover on the Ni-foam.31,32 The TiO2 thin film coated on the compact TiO2 layer functioned as the photocatalyst for the CO2 photoreduction. During the synthesis of the compact TiO2 layer on the Ni-foam surface, the Ni-foam (JYS8563, Jystape) with the dimensions of 2.0 cm × 1.5 cm × 140 μm was degreased by successively rinsing with acetone, ethanol and deionized water for 10 min with ultrasonic cleaning. The Ni-foam was then calcined at a temperature of 550 °C for 2 h under a nitrogen environment in a muffle furnace (ZK-1BY, Zhonghuan), which could further increase the specific surface area.33 After that, the Ni-foam was immersed in TiO2 precursor solution for 10 min and then dried at room temperature. The procedure was repeated once more. The TiO2 precursor solution used for synthesizing the compact TiO2 layer was prepared using the following method.34 3.5 g Triton X-100 as the nonionic surfactant was first mixed with 19 mL ethanol. 3.4 mL glacial acetic acid and 1.8 mL titanium isopropoxide were then added to the mixture followed by stirring for 1 hour. The Ni-foam with the adsorbed precursor was then calcined at a temperature of 500 °C for 30 min with a temperature ramp of 10 °C min−1 in a muffle furnace, by which the compact TiO2 layer could be successfully synthesized. For coating a TiO2 thin film on the compact TiO2 layer, the Ni-foam coated with the compact TiO2 layer was immersed in another type of precursor solution for 10 min and then dried in a nitrogen environment. For the preparation of this precursor solution, it can refer to the previous work.35 Briefly, 20 mL tetrabutyl titanate was first diluted with 5 mL diethanolamine and 75 mL ethanol and then the mixture was stirred for 1 h. A solution of deionized water and ethanol with a ratio of 1:2 was then added to the prepared mixture at a flow rate of 1 mL min−1 for 3 min, followed by 1 h stirring to form the precursor solution. After that, the Ni-foam was calcined at a temperature of 550 °C for 1 h to form a TiO2 thin film on the compact TiO2 layer. The above-mentioned processes were repeated three times to successfully fabricate a TiO2 thin film. The above-used reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. Ltd unless indicated.
2.2 Preparation of the photoanode
TiO2 as the photoanode of the PFC was loaded on FTO glass using a spray method.36 Here, 12 g TiO2 (Aeroxide P25, Evonik-Degussa) was dispersed in 120 mL deionized water under stirring, and then 0.4 mL acetylacetone was dissolved in the mixture to prevent the aggregation of the nanoparticles. 0.2 mL Triton X-100 was added to the mixture as the dispersant. Finally, 2.4 g polyethylene glycol was added, and the mixture was continuously stirred for 12 h to form a TiO2 sol. The prepared TiO2 sol was directly sprayed on the FTO glass (8 Ω sq−1, Guluoglass) and then calcined at a temperature of 550 °C for 2 h to form a TiO2 film with an active area of 1.0 cm × 1.0 cm and a loading of about 3.5 mg cm−2.
2.3 Experimental system
In the present work, a commercial Pt/carbon paper cathode (DMFC cathode, Alfa Aesar) with an active area of 1.0 cm × 1.0 cm and a loading of 2.0 mg cm−2 was used as the air-breathing cathode. The integrated system, which consists of a 3D TiO2/Ni-foam, a PMMA reaction chamber, a TiO2-coated FTO glass, a cathode and four PMMA plates, is shown in Fig. 1b. Gaskets and bolts were utilized for holding the fixture and sealing. The PMMA reaction chamber with a thickness of 2 mm and a hollowed-out pattern was designed and fabricated, which could fix the 3D TiO2/Ni-foam. Two PMMA cathode plates with a thickness of 0.2 mm and a hollowed-out square pattern of 1.0 cm in length were used to hold the cathode. The picture of the integrated system is shown in Fig. 1c. Prior to the experiments, 99.99% CO2 was continuously supplied to sulfuric acid (0.02 M H2SO4) for 30 min to obtain a CO2-saturated sulfuric acid solution. The prepared solution was then supplied into the integrated system using a syringe pump (LSP01-3A, Longe). A UV-LED lamp (HTLD-S60-365, Height-led) was used as the light source to illuminate the 3D TiO2/Ni-foam and the photoanode of the PFC with the light intensity ranging from 4 mW cm−2 to 10 mW cm−2. The electricity generation was characterized using an electronic load system (CT-3008, Neware Technology). The short circuit current density, the open circuit voltage and the maximum power density were obtained from the polarization curve.
Meanwhile, the hydrocarbons from the integrated system's exit were collected using reagent bottles and analyzed using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GCMS, GC-MS-TQ8040, Shimadzu). Besides, an integrated system without the PFC's photoanode and cathode was designed and fabricated for characterizing the hydrocarbons from the CO2 photoreduction chamber's exit. The existence of a specific component in the products can be determined using the peak time. In this work, it was demonstrated that methanol was the main product from the CO2 photoreduction chamber. Hence, only methanol concentration was characterized using a gas chromatograph (GC, GC-2010 Plus, Shimadzu). The concentration of the specific component can be calculated using the chromatographic peak area. The standard curve of methanol concentration was achieved by external calibration. The chromatogram peak areas of aqueous methanol solutions with concentrations of 0.1 mM, 1.0 mM, 2.0 mM and 4.0 mM were obtained and the relationship between chromatogram peak area and methanol concentration was: Y = 4.50778 × 10−5X + 0.01673 (R2 = 0.99981)(6)where X is the methanol concentration (mM) and Y is the chromatographic peak area. During the measurements, the environment temperature and relative humidity were maintained at 25 °C and 45%, respectively. Each experiment was repeated at least 3 times.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 3D TiO2/Ni-foam characterization
XRD analysis (D8 ADVANCE, Bruker) was utilized to characterize the photocatalyst of the 3D TiO2/Ni-foam. The Ni-foam’s pore density was 110 pores per inch (ppi). As shown in Fig. 2a, the presence of anatase TiO2 on the Ni-foam could be confirmed by the crystalline diffraction peaks at 2θ of 25.4° and 62.7°, which corresponded to the TiO2 anatase 101 and anatase 204 planes. This result indicated the successful preparation of the TiO2 photocatalyst on the Ni-foam skeleton. It was also found that due to the use of Ni foam as the catalyst skeleton, the crystalline diffraction peaks of Ni at 2θ of 44.3°, 51.6° and 76.4° were obviously observed. Because the amount of TiO2 was much smaller than that of Ni, the crystalline diffraction peaks of TiO2 were much weaker than those of Ni.
 Fig. 2  (a) The XRD pattern and (b) the UV-Vis absorption spectrum of the 3D TiO2/Ni-foam; (c) the SEM images of bare Ni-foam and 3D TiO2/Ni-foam. 
The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of the 3D TiO2/Ni-foam measured by UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV2550, Shimadzu) is shown in Fig. 2b. An overwhelming majority of the absorbed light had a wavelength below 400 nm. Therefore, under UV-light irradiation, the 3D TiO2/Ni-foam could effectively capture photons to actuate the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to hydrocarbons. By applying the K–M function to plot F(R) versus hν, the band gap Eg of the prepared TiO2 was calculated to be 3.1 eV,37,38 (7)where m of −0.017 and b of 6.85 were obtained by the linear fitting of the flat section of the UV-Vis absorption spectrum.

Fig. 2c shows the SEM (S4800-SEM, Hitachi) images of bare Ni-foam and the prepared photocatalyst. It is seen that the 3D TiO2/Ni-foam possessed a porous and hollow structure, which significantly increased the surface area of the photocatalyst providing more photocatalytic sites. Moreover, the porous and hollow structure of the Ni-foam could enhance mass transport by offering plenty of transport paths. The SEM images also depict that some discontinuous sheet structures were formed on the TiO2 film by the lateral contraction stress during the calcination process. The loading of TiO2 on the Ni-foam (110 ppi) was measured to be about 5.58 mg cm−2 by ICP-MS (7500ce, Agilent).
3.2 Discharging performance of the integrated system
In this part, the discharging performance of the integrated system using CO2 is presented. Here, a CO2-saturated sulfuric acid solution (0.02 M H2SO4) was continually injected into the integrated system with a flow rate of 0.32 mL min−1. The corresponding residence time in the CO2 photoreduction section was 112.5 s while that in the PFC section was 60.0 s. The UV-light intensity arriving at both the photocatalyst layer for CO2 photoreduction and the photoanode of the PFC was 10.0 mW cm−2. The polarization curve of the PFC in the integrated system was measured and the products at the CO2 photoreduction section's exit and the integrated system's exit were collected and analyzed, respectively.
As shown in Fig. 3a, the open circuit voltage (OCV) of the PFC in the coupled system was 0.98 V and the short circuit current density (SCCD) was 0.20 mA cm−2 while the maximum power density (MPD) reached 0.122 mW cm−2. The monochromatic incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (MIPCE) of the PFC in the integrated system was also calculated by:39 (8)where i denotes the SCCD (μA cm−2), λ denotes the wavelength of the light source (nm) and P denotes the light power density (μW cm−2). Under the above-mentioned operating conditions, the MIPCE of the PFC in the integrated system was 6.79%. In comparison to the discharging performance of the coupled system without CO2 (OCV: 0.88 V, SCCD: 0.09 mA cm−2, MPD: 0.034 mW cm−2, MIPEC: 3.06%), an obvious improvement in the discharging performance of the coupled system was acquired by supplying CO2. The improved performance could be attributed to the generation of hydrocarbons by CO2 photoreduction. When these generated hydrocarbons subsequently flowed into the PFC to function as fuels, the photo-excited holes at the photoanode of the PFC were easily scavenged by the generated hydrocarbons, which could effectively suppress the recombination of the electron–hole pairs at the photoanode of the PFC. The electrons were then transferred through the external load to the cathode. In the absence of CO2, the electron–hole pairs generated at the photoanode of the PFC easily recombined due to the absence of hydrocarbons, resulting in a relatively low power generation. Therefore, by integrating CO2 photoreduction with a PFC, this system could directly use the hydrocarbons from the CO2 photoreduction section as fuels to generate electricity. Because 3D TiO2/Ni-foam was utilized for CO2 photoreduction, the large surface area and highly porous structure could not only provide more active sites for the CO2 reduction reaction but also enhance the mass transport and avail light scattering. More products could be generated for the PFC, leading to improved discharging performance of the coupled system.

To prove this point, the products at the CO2 photoreduction section's exit and the integrated system's exit were analyzed. Fig. 3b shows the methanol concentration at the CO2 photoreduction chamber's exit and at the coupled system's exit under different current densities. A methanol concentration of 0.83 mM from the CO2 photoreduction chamber was detected. As a result of the generated methanol, the integrated system with the 3D TiO2/Ni-foam yielded better discharging performance than the case without CO2. More interestingly, it was found that the methanol concentration at the integrated system's exit was slightly higher than that at the CO2 photoreduction chamber's exit. This phenomenon might be attributed to the following possible reasons. First, due to the low concentration of methanol from the CO2 photoreduction chamber, the methanol diffusion to the photoanode of the PFC was limited and therefore only a part of methanol coming from the upstream could be consumed to generate electricity in the PFC. On the other hand, part of unreacted CO2 from the CO2 photoreduction chamber might be reduced at the photoanode of the PFC. Under light irradiation, the electron–hole pairs in the photoanode were excited. The photo-excited holes were scavenged by the hydrocarbons. With regard to the photo-excited electrons, although the electrons could be transferred through the external load to the cathode to complete the reduction reaction of O2, there still existed some electrons that were consumed at the photoanode for the photoreduction of the unreacted CO2 to methanol because the photo-excited electrons at the photoanode had strong reduction ability. In addition, because the methanol was in situ generated at the photoanode of the PFC via the photoreduction of the unreacted CO2, part of the in situ generated methanol may be easily consumed for electricity generation, which lowers the consumption of the methanol produced from the CO2 photoreduction chamber. Meanwhile, part of the in situ generated methanol may flow out of the integrated system along with the methanol produced in the CO2 photoreduction chamber. Because of these reasons, the amount of consumed methanol was less than the amount of newly formed methanol. Consequently, the methanol concentration at the integrated system's exit was higher than that at the CO2 photoreduction chamber' exit. Since the mechanisms of the reactions occurring at the photoanode of the PFC in such an integrated system are rather complex, further studies are needed. In summary, the above results indicated that CO2 could be effectively reduced by the 3D TiO2/Ni-foam in the CO2 photoreduction chamber, whose products could be used as fuels for the PFC to generate electricity by the photoelectrochemical oxidation of the hydrocarbons. Moreover, because unreacted CO2 could still be reduced to hydrocarbons at the photoanode of the PFC to in situ provide fuels, the coupled system not only generated electricity but also increased the yield of hydrocarbons.
To further demonstrate the contribution of the supplied CO2 in the integrated system for the power generation of the PFC, we removed the CO2 photoreduction section and made the PFC work by directly supplying fuel. To avoid the possible effect of the dissolved CO2 at the cathode, a proton exchange membrane (Nafion 211, Dupont) was added in the single PFC system to separate the photoanode and the cathode. As discussed above, the PFC in the integrated system was operated with low concentration of methanol produced from CO2 photoreduction, so this single PFC was operated with 0.5 mM methanol to simulate the integrated system environment. Here, a N2-saturated aqueous sulfuric acid solution with 0.5 mM methanol or a CO2-saturated aqueous sulfuric acid solution with 0.5 mM methanol was supplied to the photoanode of the single PFC, while the N2-saturated aqueous sulfuric acid solution was supplied to the cathode. Other parameters were the same as above. It was found that in the case without CO2, the OCV of the single PFC was 0.97 V, the SCCD was 0.11 mA cm−2, and the MPD was 0.053 mW cm−2. The methanol concentration at the PFC's exit was about 0.49 mM, which was slightly lower than the inlet concentration and thereby demonstrated the fuel consumption at the photoanode by the photoelectrochemical reactions. However, in the case of supplied CO2, the OCV of the single PFC was 0.97 V and the SCCD was 0.13 mA cm−2 while the MPD was 0.070 mW cm−2. The methanol concentration at the PFC's exit was about 0.72 mM. The SCCD and MPD and the methanol concentration at the PFC's exit were higher than those of the case without CO2. Therefore, it was confirmed that the methanol formed in the CO2 photoreduction chamber could be used as a fuel for the downstream PFC in the integrated system. Moreover, the unreacted CO2 dissolved in the solution could be further reduced at the PFC photoanode, which improved the methanol yield and electricity generation of the integrated system.
3.3 Effect of light intensity and the pore density of the Ni-foam
As mentioned above, the electricity generation of the integrated system was actuated by light irradiation and so the influence of light intensity was investigated. The light intensity ranged from 4.0 mW cm−2 to 10.0 mW cm−2 while other parameters were the same as above. As shown in Fig. 4a and b, with the increase of light intensity, the discharging performance of the integrated system gradually enhanced. When the light intensity was increased from 4.0 mW cm−2 to 10.0 mW cm−2, the SCCD of the integrated system increased from 0.06 mA cm−2 to 0.20 mA cm−2, and the MPD increased from 0.035 mW cm−2 to 0.120 mW cm−2. This improvement in the discharging performance was attributed to the availability of more electron–hole pairs to be photo-excited in both the 3D TiO2/Ni-foam and the photoanode of the PFC. Therefore, the CO2 photoreduction reaction was enhanced, increasing the yield of hydrocarbons for the follow-up photoelectrochemical reactions at the PFC photoanode. With the light power densities of 4 mW cm−2, 6 mW cm−2, 8 mW cm−2, and 10 mW cm−2, the MIPCEs of the PFC in the integrated system were 5.44%, 6.57%, 6.37% and 6.79%, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5a, the methanol concentration at the CO2 photoreduction chamber's exit gradually increased from 0.39 mM to 0.83 mM when the light intensity was increased from 4.0 mW cm−2 to 10.0 mW cm−2. Second, more electron–hole pairs could also be generated at the photoanode of the PFC to promote the photoelectrochemical oxidation of the hydrocarbons and the photoreduction of the unreacted CO2. As a result, the power generation of the integrated system obviously improved with increasing the light intensity. As shown in Fig. 5b, for a given circuit current density of 0.05 mA cm−2, the methanol concentration at the integrated system's exit gradually increased from 0.52 mM to 1.09 mM when the light intensity was increased from 4.0 mW cm−2 to 10.0 mW cm−2.

Clearly, the power generation performance of the integrated system highly depends on CO2 photoreduction. In the present study, the TiO2 photocatalysts were synthesized on Ni-foam, whose purpose was to provide larger surface area for loading the photocatalysts and to enhance mass transport. Hence, the structure of the Ni-foam has a significant influence on the generation of hydrocarbons by CO2 photoreduction and thus the electricity generation of the integrated system. Here, three types of Ni-foams (pore density: 30 ppi, 90 ppi, and 110 ppi) were used to investigate the influence of the Ni-foam skeleton on the discharging performance of the integrated system. The properties of the Ni-foams with different pore densities are listed in Table 1. During the testing, the light intensity was kept at 10.0 mW cm−2 and other parameters were the same as above. As shown in Fig. 6a and b, the discharging performance of the integrated system apparently increased with the pore density of the Ni-foam. When the pore density was increased from 30 ppi to 110 ppi, the SCCD increased from 0.14 mA cm−2 to 0.20 mA cm−2, and the MPD increased from 0.076 mW cm−2 to 0.120 mW cm−2. With the Ni-foam pore densities of 30 ppi, 90 ppi, and 110 ppi, the MIPCEs of the PFC in the integrated system were 4.69%, 5.84%, and 6.79%, respectively. Such phenomena can be explained as follows. First, although their mass-based specific surface areas were the same, larger Ni-foam pore density increased the surface area in a given volume for loading TiO2. As a result, the photocatalyst loading was increased (30 ppi: 2.68 mg cm−2, 90 ppi: 4.91 mg cm−2, and 110 ppi: 5.58 mg cm−2). The increase of the photocatalyst loading resulting from the increased pore density of the Ni-foam could provide more active sites for the photoreduction of CO2 and thereby increase the yield of hydrocarbons. As shown in Fig. 7a, with the increase of pore density from 30 ppi to 110 ppi, the methanol concentration at the CO2 photoreduction chamber's exit increased from 0.50 mM to 0.83 mM, which led to enhanced electricity generation of the integrated system. As shown in Fig. 7b, for a given circuit current density of 0.05 mA cm−2, the methanol concentration at the integrated system's exit gradually increased from 0.74 mM to 1.09 mM with the increase of pore density from 30 ppi to 110 ppi. On the other hand, the increase of pore density could also enhance mass transport by inducing stronger perturbation to the fluid flow and avail light scattering for the utilization of photons, which also benefited the CO2 photoreduction and further enhanced the power generation performance of the integrated system.

4. Conclusions
In this work, an integrated system that consisted of CO2 photoreduction with 3D TiO2/Ni-foam interconnected to a PFC for direct power generation by using CO2 was developed. This design could effectively overcome the difficulties in the post-use of the products of CO2 photoreduction. Notably, the 3D TiO2/Ni-foam as the photocatalyst was able to provide a large surface area for loading the photocatalyst and its highly porous structure could enhance mass transport and avail light scattering, both of which facilitated CO2 photoreduction to improve the yield of hydrocarbons and thus enhanced the power generation. The effects of pore density and light intensity on the electricity generation of the integrated system were investigated. It was shown that stronger light intensity could generate more electron–hole pairs, which was beneficial for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 and the photoelectrochemical oxidation of the hydrocarbons and thereby improved the electricity generation of the integrated system. Larger pore density could increase the yield of the hydrocarbons produced by CO2 photoreduction due to larger surface area and more active sites and enhanced mass transport and light scattering, thereby improving electricity generation by this integrated system. It is also interesting to find that the unreacted CO2 from the upstream could be in situ reduced to hydrocarbons at the photoanode of the PFC, leading to increased fuel concentration out of the integrated system. However, the photoreactions occurring at the photoanode of the PFC in such an integrated system are rather complex. The underlying reaction mechanisms need further investigation. In summary, this work opens an avenue for effective CO2 utilization to directly generate electricity. It is believed that by applying novel catalysts and optimizing the catalyst structure, the electricity generation of the integrated systems by using CO2 can be further increased.
