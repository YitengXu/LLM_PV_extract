    , Accepted 22nd January 2019First published on 23rd January 2019AbstractCu3PS4 nanoparticles are used as a new inorganic hole selective layer (HSL) to fabricate efficient perovskite thin-film solar cells in the inverted device configuration. Compared with other HSL materials used in efficient perovskite solar cells, Cu3PS4 has the smallest effective mass for holes. Additionally, Cu3PS4 has a valence band energy level of −5.05 eV, which is suitable for effectively extracting holes generated in perovskite absorbers.

We further find that a Cu3PS4 nanoparticle HSL promotes grain growth of perovskite thin films, which benefits device performance. Our perovskite solar cells using a Cu3PS4 nanoparticle HSL achieve a maximum power conversion efficiency of 18.17% with small hysteresis and a high fill factor of 81.6%, which is significantly better than the performance of the best control device using the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) HSL.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted intensive attention in the past few years due to their rapid increase in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), with a certified record PCE of 23.3% reported recently.1 The operation of a PSC relies on the use of charge selective layers including the electron selective layer (ESL), which extracts and transfers electrons but blocks holes photogenerated in the perovskite absorber,2–4 and the hole selective layer (HSL), which extracts and transfers holes but blocks electrons.5–8 Therefore, besides the material quality and interface passivation of the perovskite absorber, the effectiveness of the ESL and HSL is another key factor determining the PCE of a PSC.2,9–11 To be charge selective and suppress charge recombination, the ESL and HSL materials should not have high carrier concentrations and must have large bandgaps with suitable energy levels.12,13 Furthermore, to effectively transfer the extracted charges, small effective masses are highly preferable for the ESL and HSL materials. So far, organic and inorganic ESL and HSL materials have been used.14–19 In terms of long-term stability of PSCs, inorganic ESL and HSL materials are preferred.16,20,21 While stable and efficient inorganic ESL materials such as TiO2,17,22–24 ZnO,25,26 and SnO2 have been used in PSCs,4,27 current inorganic HSL materials such as NiOx,28–30 Cu-delafossites,31–33 and CuSCN16,34 underperform compared to their organic counterparts such as poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine) (PTAA) and 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-bis(p-methoxy-phenyl)amino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD).14,35–37 A major issue of the current inorganic HSL materials is inefficient hole transport, due to their large effective masses for holes.33,38
Here, we report a new HSL material, Cu3PS4, which has a reasonably small effective mass for holes and a wide-enough bandgap for blocking electrons. Cu3PS4 possesses the enargite crystal structure with a symmetry of Pmn21 (Fig. S1†).39–41 Due to the high symmetry and the d10 electronic configuration of Cu, the calculated effective mass for holes is 0.8 m0, which is much smaller than that of NiOx (∼1 m0) and Cu delafossites (>3 m0),42 enabling high mobility in Cu3PS4. Since the valence band maximum (VBM) of Cu3PS4 is largely derived from the Cu d10 orbital, which has a high energy position, the VBM of Cu3PS4 is higher in energy than that of halide perovskite absorbers, leading to efficient hole extraction from perovskite absorbers. Additionally, Cu3PS4 has an indirect bandgap of 2.20 eV, large enough to enable effective electron blocking. Therefore, enargite Cu3PS4 is a promising HSL candidate for fabricating efficient PSCs.
In this paper, we evaluate the performance of Cu3PS4 nanoparticles (NPs) as an HSL in the inverted device configuration. The use of pre-synthesized Cu3PS4 NPs enables us to prepare smooth, compact, and thin HSLs. Our measurements show a VBM level of −5.05 eV and a bandgap of 2.20 eV for the Cu3PS4 NP HSL, which are suitable for effectively extracting holes generated in perovskite absorbers and blocking electrons, respectively. We further find that the Cu3PS4 NP HSL promotes grain growth of perovskite thin films, which benefits the device performance. Our PSCs using the Cu3PS4 NP HSL achieve a maximum PCE of 18.17% with small hysteresis and a high fill factor (FF) of 81.6%, which is significantly better than the performance of the best control device using the PEDOT:PSS HSL, one of the most commonly used organic HSL materials that has a similar VBM energy level to that of the Cu3PS4 NP HSL. As shown in Table S1,† Cu3PS4 has the smallest effective mass for holes and the best FF compared with other Cu-based HSLs. Our results demonstrate the promise of the Cu3PS4 NP HSL for fabricating efficient PSCs.
2. Results and discussion
Cu3PS4 NPs were synthesized according to Graeser and Agrawal.40 The structure and phase purity of the NPs were confirmed via X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy (Fig. S2†). Fig. 1a shows the Tauc plot of a Cu3PS4 NP film spin-coated on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass substrate. The thickness of the Cu3PS4 NP film is about 20 nm, determined using the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image. The calculated indirect optical bandgap (Eg) is around 2.20 eV. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to determine the energy level of Cu3PS4. Ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) was adopted as the internal standard, giving a potential of 0.55 V. As shown in Fig. 1b, a clear oxidation potential of 0.8 V was observed for Cu3PS4. The VBM of Cu3PS4 was, therefore, calculated to be −5.05 eV. The corresponding conduction band minimum (CBM) was estimated to be −2.85 eV according to the optical bandgap of 2.20 eV.

To evaluate the effectiveness of hole extraction and transport and electron blocking for Cu3PS4, we fabricated PSCs with Cu3PS4 and PEDOT:PSS HSLs. Fig. 2a shows the device structure of our PSCs with the inverted (p–i–n) planar structure of FTO/HSL/perovskite/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag, which consists of a Cu3PS4 or PEDOT:PSS HSL, a MA0.7FA0.3PbI3 (MA = methylammonium and FA = formamidinium) perovskite absorber, a PCBM/BCP combined ESL, and a Ag cathode. Fig. 2b shows the corresponding cross-sectional SEM image of a PSC with a 20 nm Cu3PS4 HSL. The compact and uniform morphology of Cu3PS4 films, as shown in Fig. 2c, can be easily obtained through a simple spin-coating method. PSC fabrication benefits from a high-quality and pinhole-free HSL layer as seen in our films.28,43

The energy band diagram of our PSC is shown in Fig. 2d. It is seen that the VBM of Cu3PS4 is lower than that of PEDOT:PSS (−4.9 eV), which is more favorable for pinning the Fermi level at the perovskite/HSL interface closer to the VBM of the perovskite absorber, consequently benefiting the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the device. Aside from the more favorable energetic level, we found that the Cu3PS4 HSL promotes grain growth of perovskite thin films. As shown in the top-view SEM image (Fig. 2e), the perovskite film deposited on the Cu3PS4 HSL shows large grains with an average size of ∼750 nm, greatly enlarged from an average size of ∼300 nm for the control perovskite films deposited on the PEDOT:PSS HSL (Fig. 2f). Grain boundaries can act as traps and provide paths for ion diffusion and therefore are detrimental for VOC and FF. Perovskite films with large grains are favorable for achieving higher VOC and FF in PSCs.44–46 The large grains of perovskite films deposited on the Cu3PS4 HSL may be attributed to the S component in the Cu3PS4 HSL. It has been shown that a thiourea additive can promote perovskite grain growth.47 Moreover, the more hydrophobic surface of Cu3PS4 may also facilitate the grain growth (Fig. S3†).48
The favorable hole extraction of the Cu3PS4 HSL is evidenced from the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. 3a) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay curves (Fig. 3b). As shown in Fig. 3a, the PEDOT:PSS and Cu3PS4 HSLs show strong quenching of the PL emission from the perovskite film due to the charge transfer at the HSL/perovskite interface. The more pronounced PL quenching observed in the Cu3PS4/perovskite than in the PEDOT:PSS/perovskite is likely the result of better hole transfer. The quenching effect is also clearly seen in the TRPL decay curves. The measured mean carrier lifetimes for perovskites deposited on bare glass, PEDOT:PSS-coated FTO glass, and Cu3PS4-coated FTO glass are 1200, 29, and 16 ns, respectively. Both PL and TRPL results show that the Cu3PS4 HSL transfers holes more effectively than the PEDOT:PSS HSL, indicating efficient charge extraction at the perovskite/Cu3PS4 interface.5,6

We fabricated a large number of PSCs with Cu3PS4 HSLs to optimize the device performance. We examined the impact of the thickness of the Cu3PS4 HSL on the performance of PSCs by varying its thickness from 8 to 33 nm, achieved by controlling both the spin speed and precursor concentration (Table S2†). As shown in Fig. S4a,† the VOC of the devices increased monotonically with the increasing thickness of Cu3PS4. Limited by the size of the Cu3PS4 NPs (5–10 nm), Cu3PS4 films must be thick enough (e.g., >15 nm) to achieve continuous and uniform coverage on the FTO electrode. This would prevent shorting paths connecting the perovskite absorber and FTO, which is a prerequisite for high VOC values. However, very thick Cu3PS4 films (e.g., >30 nm) lead to significant absorption of photons with wavelengths below 500 nm (see Fig. S5†), resulting in reduced short-circuit current density (JSC) and FF (Fig. S4b and c†). These results show that the optimum thickness for Cu3PS4 is around 20 nm (Fig. S4d†).
The PSCs using Cu3PS4 HSLs significantly outperform the PSCs using PEDOT:PSS HSLs (Fig. S6†). Fig. 4a compares the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the champion PSCs using Cu3PS4 and PEDOT:PSS HSLs, measured under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G illumination. Our champion device using the Cu3PS4 HSL achieves a maximum PCE of 18.17 (17.66)%, with a VOC of 1.069 (1.060) V, a JSC of 20.83 (20.85) mA cm−2, and a FF of 81.6 (79.9)% under reverse (forward) voltage scans. In contrast, the PSC with the PEDOT:PSS HSL exhibits a much inferior PCE of 13.70 (11.30)%, with a VOC of 0.850 (0.840) V, a JSC of 20.67 (20.39) mA cm−2, and a FF of 78.0 (66.0)%. Importantly, the J–V hysteresis for the Cu3PS4-based device is much lower than that for the PEDOT:PSS-based device. The enhanced PCE of the Cu3PS4-based PSC is mainly due to the improvement in both VOC and FF. Compared with PEDOT:PSS, Cu3PS4 shows a 0.15 eV deeper VBM level, leading to a better energy level match with the perovskite absorber and reduced VOC loss.18,38 Moreover, the enhancement in VOC is also attributed to the increased grain size shown in Fig. 2e and f, which reduces charge recombination at grain boundaries.48 The improved FF can be attributed to the enhanced hole extraction by the Cu3PS4 layer as discussed before. The EQE-integrated JSC values over the AM1.5G spectrum of PSCs with the Cu3PS4 or PEDOT:PSS HSL are 20.80 and 20.56 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4b), respectively, which are in agreement with the JSC values obtained from the J–V curves. It is obvious that the Cu3PS4-based device exhibits lower spectral responses in the short wavelength region (<470 nm) due to optical absorption of the Cu3PS4 film. However, the higher EQE values in the longer wavelength region (500 to 800 nm), likely due to the enhanced film quality of the perovskite absorber, dominate the photocurrent contribution. Additionally, the steady-state power output measurements of PSCs with the Cu3PS4 HSL were carried out at a constant bias of 0.930 V for 600 s. Our champion device shows a maximum power point current density of approximately 19.24 mA cm−2, corresponding to a stabilized PCE of ∼17.9% (Fig. 4c). To evaluate the device reproducibility of Cu3PS4-based PSCs, we fabricated 40 devices in several different batches. The PCE histogram is shown in Fig. 4d. The average PCE is 17.43±0.74%, with an average VOC of 1.019±0.058 V, an average JSC of 21.59±0.79 mA cm−2, and an average FF of 79.3 ± 4.4%, measured under the reverse voltage scan.

To get a further insight into the charge transport/recombination mechanism in the p–i–n PSCs with the Cu3PS4 HSL, the power law dependence of JSC on light intensity (J ∝ Iα) was measured under light intensities ranging from 1 to 100 mW cm−2 (Fig. 5a). A linear regression analysis performed on a double logarithmic scale shows that α = 0.96 and 0.95 for devices with Cu3PS4 and PEDOT:PSS HSLs, indicating that the device with the Cu3PS4 HSL is similarly space charge limited as that with PEDOT:PSS.6,49Fig. 5b shows the relationship of VOC and logarithmic light intensity. The device with the Cu3PS4 (PEDOT:PSS) HSL has an ideality factor of 1.36 (1.26) kT/q, indicating that trap-assisted Shockley–Read–Hall recombination occurs in both Cu3PS4 and PEDOT:PSS devices.14

To investigate the device stability of PSCs with the Cu3PS4 or PEDOT:PSS HSL, we measured the efficiency of unencapsulated PSCs in ambient air at 25 °C and a relative humidity of around 50% (see the PCE decay in Fig. 5c). For the PEDOT:PSS-based PSC, the PCE dropped almost 50% within only 10 days. This is likely due to the acidic and hygroscopic nature of PEDOT:PSS, which may damage the front electrodes and the adjacent perovskite layers.12,50 In contrast, the PSC using the Cu3PS4 HSL shows much higher ambient stability, retaining 87% of its initial performance after 60 days. This result is consistent with the water contact angle test (Fig. S3b and c†); Cu3PS4 (60°) is much more hydrophobic than PEDOT:PSS (11°). Thus, our inorganic Cu3PS4 NPs deliver not only improved device performance, but also enhanced device stability, making it a promising candidate for the commercialization of PSCs.
3. Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrate a new inorganic HSL based on Cu3PS4 NPs with facile solution processability. A high quality Cu3PS4 film is easily obtained through spin coating. Benefiting from the unique surface properties of Cu3PS4, large perovskite grains with sizes of over 750 nm are acquired. Planar p–i–n PSCs using Cu3PS4 HSLs achieved a maximum PCE of 18.17% with small hysteresis and a steady-state efficiency of 17.90%. Moreover, the Cu3PS4-based device without encapsulation retained over 87% of its initial PCE after 60 days in air (25 °C, 50% relative humidity), revealing decent long-term stability. Therefore, Cu3PS4 is an excellent candidate as the HSL for further commercialization of the promising PSC technology.
4. Experimental section
4.1. Materials
PEDOT:PSS was purchased from Heraeus (4083). Anhydrous solvents including ethanol, chlorobenzene, N,N-dimethylmethanamide, dimethyl sulfoxide and diethyl ether, as well as copper(II) chloride (CuCl2), phosphorus(V) sulfide (P2S5), 1-dodecanethiol (DDT), and oleylamine (OLA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Hexane and isopropanol (molecular biology grade) were purchased from Fisher. Methylammonium iodide and formamidinium iodide were purchased from Dyesol. Lead iodide and lead thiocyanate were purchased from Alfa Aesar. PCBM and BCP were purchased from 1-Material.
4.2. Nanoparticle synthesis
Cu3PS4 nanoparticles were synthesized according to a previous report.40 Briefly, a flask containing 2 mmol CuCl2, 0.5 mmol P2S5, and 4 mL DDT was heated to 250 °C under an inert atmosphere and allowed to react for 1 h. After cooling, the contents of the flask were pipetted into a centrifuge tube for washing. Three suspension and precipitation cycles using OLA, hexane, and isopropanol were conducted, followed by three cycles using hexane and isopropanol only. The resulting NP pellet was dried under argon flow before use in device experiments.
4.3. Device fabrication
The Fluorine-doped Tin Oxide (FTO) substrates were cleaned by ultra-sonication in diluted Micro-90 detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol for 30 min, respectively. A solution of Cu3PS4/chlorobenzene (30 mg mL−1) was spin-coated on FTO at 4000 rpm for 50 s and annealed at 200 °C for 120 min in N2. PEDOT:PSS films were coated on cleaned FTO substrates at 4000 rpm for 50 s and then dried at 175 °C for 30 min in air. The perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated on the HSL layer at 500 rpm for 3 s and at 4000 rpm for 60 s using diethyl ether as the anti-solvent.5,6,8 After spin coating, the perovskite film was annealed at 100 °C for 5 min. PCBM (20 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) was then deposited on the perovskite film at 2000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 90 °C for 10 min. BCP (0.5 mg mL−1 in ethanol) was spin-coated on the PCBM film at 4000 rpm for 30 s. A layer of 75 nm silver (Ag) was then deposited on top using thermal evaporation. The working area of the devices was 0.08 cm2 as defined by a shadow mask during Ag evaporation.
4.4. Material, film and device characterization
Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were obtained using a Rigaku Smartlab diffractometer (Cu Kα source) in parallel beam geometry with an incident angle of 0.5°. Raman spectra were collected using a 633 nm He:Ne laser coupled with a Horiba/Jobin-Yvon LabRAM HR800 confocal microscope at a magnification of 100×. Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted on an electrochemical workstation with a Pt plate as the working electrode, a Pt slice as the counter electrode, and a Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode in tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6, 0.1 M) acetonitrile solutions at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) was used as the internal standard (the energy level of Fc/Fc+ is −4.8 eV under vacuum), and the formal potential of Fc/Fc+ was measured to be 0.55 V vs. the Ag/AgCl electrode. The HOMO energy level was determined from the onset oxidation potential (Eoxonset) using HOMO = −4.25 − Eoxonset (eV); while the LUMO energy level was calculated from the HOMO and optical bandgap (Eg) using the formula: LUMO = HOMO + Eg (eV).

4.4.1. Film characterization. 
High resolution field emission top-view and cross-sectional SEM images of all the films and completed devices were obtained with a Hitachi S-4800 SEM. All layer thicknesses were determined using a Dektak surface profiler and the cross-sectional SEM images. TRPL measurements were conducted similarly as described in our earlier studies.49,51


4.4.2. Device characterization. 

J–V curves were measured in air under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G solar irradiation (PV Measurements Inc.) with a Keithley 2400 Source Meter. The incident light was controlled by a shutter. The light intensity for the J–V measurements was calibrated using a standard Si solar cell and our perovskite solar cells certified by Newport.48 The steady-state efficiencies were obtained by tracking the maximum output power point. EQE spectra were obtained on a QE system (PV Measurements Inc., model IVQE8-C QE system without bias voltage) using 100 Hz chopped monochromatic light ranging from 300 to 850 nm under near-dark test conditions. All characterization studies and measurements were performed in ambient atmosphere.
