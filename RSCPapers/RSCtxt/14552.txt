    , Accepted 28th February 2020First published on 29th February 2020AbstractLead-halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted attention due to their outstanding high power-conversion efficiency. In conventional inorganic solar cells such as Si solar cells, the relationship between cell performance and crystal grain size has been extensively discussed. However, in PSCs, the effect of the grain size on the cell performance has not previously been separated from other accompanying effects such as passivation at the grain boundary and variation in thickness and quality of the grains. Here, the average grain size of the methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) perovskite could be controlled alone by the surface roughness (Rms) of the compact TiO2 layer using the same preparation conditions used for MAPbI3. The direct dominant effect of the MAPbI3 grain size on the inorganic PSC performance could be observed by controlling alone the Rms of the compact TiO2 as an electron transport layer. For a PSC with an active area of 0.54 cm2, when the MAPbI3 grain size was increased from 150 nm to 350 nm, the current density, respectively, increased from 8 to 17 mA cm−2 and the photoelectric conversion efficiency from 6.1% to 11.4%. When a PSC with 0.54 cm2 active area size had a compact TiO2 layer that had a lower Rms of about 3 nm, the average MAPbI3 grain size was between 300 nm and 400 nm, and the resulting efficiency for a PSC was 11.4%, and that with 0.16 cm2 was 13.6%. When the MAPbI3 grain size was increased, the shunt resistance increased and the serial resistance decreased. The increased MAPbI3 grain size is clearly a crucial parameter to attain higher efficiency in PSCs.
Introduction
Currently, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted attention in the solar cell field due to rapid improvement in their power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 9% to over 24%.1 In addition to extensive research of perovskite material itself, promising development has been reported for carrier transport layers, such as hole-transporting layers (HTLs) and electron-transporting layers (ETLs). The interface between the perovskite film and either the ETL or the HTL also plays a key role in the rapid improvement in high efficiency PSCs. The first organic lead-halide compounds were used in solar cells in 2009, and achieved a PCE of around 3.81%.2 These first perovskite-sensitized TiO2 solar cells were fabricated by Kojima et al. using liquid electrolytes based on iodide or bromide solutions. In 2012, a solid-state dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) was fabricated with a high PCE of 9.7% by using spiro-OMeTAD as an HTL.3 A sequential deposition method was then introduced to form perovskites within a porous metal oxide film, which, in 2013, resulted in improved film morphology and a PCE of 15%.4,5 Another breakthrough was reported in 2016 with the reported PCE of about 23.3% using either formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) or a triple cation perovskite material as an active layer.6
Based on their device structure, PSCs can be simply classified into two groups: (1) PSCs with inorganic ETLs (e.g., TiO2, ZnO, SnO2, Al2O3, ZnSnO3, WO3, SrTiO3 and BaSnO3), and (2) standard/inverted-type PSCs with organic ETLs and/or HTLs (e.g., phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS),7–9 and their derivatives). Compared with organic materials, inorganic materials as ETLs show better long-term stability.8 In inverted-type PSCs with organic materials, where the HTL is the base layer for perovskite growth, PEDOT:PSS is often used as the standard HTL because it is a hybrid conducting polymer that is widely used in organic optoelectronics due to its tunable conductivity and its high optical transmittance in the visible light wavelength range. However, one drawback is that it hinders PSC stability, because PEDOT:PSS solution is acidic and can corrode indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) substrates and possibly react with the perovskites due to MAI in the MAPbI3 structure. Another drawback is that PEDOT:PSS is an aqueous solution, and PSS is hygroscopic and thus induces instability due to MAPbI3 being unstable in a humid environment.10
PSCs with inorganic ETLs can be categorized as mesoporous PSCs, which have a device structure that is based on DSSCs and planar PSCs. In PSCs, mesoporous TiO2 is used as an ETL, and acts as a “scaffold” for the crystal growth of a perovskite film and provides a high 3D-surface area between the perovskite film and TiO2. Up to now, compared with planar PSCs, mesoporous PSCs have achieved a relatively higher PCE. However, although the interface between the perovskite and the inner surface of mesoporous TiO2 can sometimes be a critical factor in the performance of a solar cell, this interface cannot be easily controlled. Therefore, PSCs with compact TiO2 or c-TiO2 (20.2%) provide a more straightforward platform for fundamental investigation of the grain size effect on a PSC due to the simpler interface of a flat ETL film and to their stable ETL. To date, common deposition methods for TiO2 layers include spin coating,11 atomic layer deposition,12 and sputtering.13 Among deposition methods, spray-coating14–16 has particularly strong potential for large-scale production due to its low cost and its capability to produce thin films with large-scale areas for industrial applications.
Similar to an ETL layer, perovskite thin films are also compatible with low-cost solution-based or vapor-based deposition processes, and thus are beneficial for industrial-scale applications.17 In general, lead-halide perovskite films fabricated via a solution-based process are polycrystalline. In conventional inorganic solar cells, the relationship between cell performance and crystallographic properties has been extensively discussed. Compared to monocrystalline Si, polycrystalline Si solar cells exhibit lower performance because grain boundaries act as recombination centers.18 Therefore, a typical approach to improve the efficiency of Si solar cells is to increase the grain size, ultimately to fabricate monocrystalline Si films.19–21
However, the grain size effect on the PSC performance has not yet been clarified. Some studies indicate that grain boundaries in polycrystalline perovskite thin films might show less influence on the PSC performance compared with other parameters such as the halide group ratio for tunable bandgaps5 (I, Cl and Br), acid additive for reducing the defect density22 (HI, HPA and HCOOH), surface/bottom defect passivation23 (1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT), benzylamine and CuI) and doping species24 for defect passivation at grain boundaries (alkaline group, e.g., Na, K species in A-site). Early theoretical studies suggested that grain boundaries with carefully controlled growth conditions do not generate any trap states for recombination sites in polycrystalline halide perovskite thin films, which are single-crystal-like.25,26
A theoretical study by Long et al. pointed out, however, that grain boundaries might even be the major recombination sites in iodide-based perovskites. That study used nonadiabatic (NA) molecular dynamics combined with time-domain density functional theory, and showed that MAPbI3 grain boundaries significantly increase the electron–hole recombination rate.28 Furthermore, numerous studies have used mesoporous TiO2 where the effect of the grain size could not clearly be separated from that of imperfections in the interface (e.g., void formation) between the perovskite film and the inner porous surface of TiO2.27 In addition, in some studies, the grain size was controlled by other additives that affect crystal quality (as discussed in the following paragraphs).17,28,29 Therefore, direct experimental evidence of the effect of the grain size on the PSC performance under defined conditions is required.
Next, we summarize previous studies related to this effect of grain size for both organic and inorganic structures of PSCs. In PSCs with an organic structure, Nie et al. studied millimeter-scale grain sizes of MAPbI1−xClx fabricated using a 1-step solution-based process combined with a hot-casting technique to grow continuous, pinhole-free thin MAPbI1−xClx films.17 A hot-casting temperature of 130, 170 and 190 °C yielded an increased grain size of 20, 70 and 180 μm, respectively, and an increased PSC efficiency of 9%, 12% and 18%. However, numerous parameters other than grain size were involved in this effect of hot-casting temperature, such as variation in absorber thickness and grain quality.
Liu et al. reported a change in the polymer-to-PC61BM ratio in bulk heterojunction films in ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3:P3HT:PCBM/P3HT:PCBM/Ca:Al.29 In that study, PSCs were fabricated using 1-step deposition of MAPbI3 with different P3HT:PCBM ratios, namely, pure PC61BM, 1:20, 1:10, 1:5, 3:10, 1:2, 3:5, 7:10, and pure P3HT. Results showed that the MAPbI3 grain size gradually decreased from 2.1 μm for pure PC61BM to 50 nm for P3HT:PCBM = 1:1. However, the maximum PCE (18.34%) was achieved when P3HT:PCBM = 1:10 where the MAPbI3 grain size was 1.2 μm, whereas the largest MAPbI3 grain size (2.1 μm) yielded a PCE of only 17.36%. The PCE gradually decreased to 5.34% for 50 nm (1:1). These results reveal that the P3HT:PCBM ratio in MAPbI3 is involved in the grain size effect.
Bi et al. studied the MAPbI3 layer fabricated via 2-step deposition on wet and non-wetting surface HTLs (i.e., low and high water contact angle, respectively) consisting of either PVA, PEDOT:PSS, c-OTPD, or PTAA-covered ITO substrates.30 The resulting MAPbI3 film thickness was 360 nm, 500 nm and 600 nm, respectively. The average MAPbI3 grain size in the MAPbI3 film was 277 nm, 301 nm, 813 nm, respectively, and the PCE was 12.3%, 17.8% and 18.1%. These results reveal that higher absorption due to a thicker film is involved in the grain size effect.
In PSCs with an inorganic structure (FTO or ITO/ compact TiO2/MAPbI3 or FAMAPbI1−xBr1 or MAPbI3−xClx/spiro-OMeTAD/Au), the grain size could be controlled by changing one or more of the following parameters:28–37 (1) additive ratio in the perovskite film,31 (2) doping percentage,32 (3) perovskite formation temperature,33,34 and (4) ratio of PbI2/MACl or FAI/MABr.35–37 By adjusting any of these four parameters, not only the grain size but also the respective parameter itself are involved in the grain size effect that influences the PSC performance. The remainder of this section briefly describes studies that experimentally revealed the involvement of each of these parameters in the grain size effect.
In the case of parameter (1), namely, the additive ratio in the perovskite film, FAMAPbI1−xBr1 was prepared by 2-step deposition, and its grain size was controlled by addition of a nonconductive binding polymer.31 The grain size of FAMAPbI1−xBr1 was 250 nm with no additive, and increased to 500 nm with 5% polyvinyl butyral (PVB) additive, and increased to 1 μm with 5% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The PCE was 15.14% with no additive, 17.22% with PVB, and 19.10% with PVA. These additives were agglomerated on the surface of the perovskite film and also distributed at the boundaries of the film, thus affecting the quality of the perovskite crystals. This difference in crystal quality is thus involved in the grain size effect.
In the case of parameter (2), namely, the doping percentage, MAPbI3 was prepared by 1-step deposition32 and doped with cationic species, such as 1.0 mol% of Na+ or K+ in MAPbI3. MAPbI3 with no doping, 1% Na+, and 1% K+ improved the grain size to 140 nm, 220 nm, and 230 nm, respectively, and improved the PCE to 15.56%, 18.16%, and 17.81%. The alkali metal cations were doped in the grain and accumulated at the grain boundaries, thus affecting the grain properties. The passivation effect of the dopant is therefore involved in the grain size effect by suppressing the defect state at the grain boundaries.
In the case of parameter (3), namely, the perovskite formation temperature (i.e., initial-growth/post-annealing temperature), the MAPbI3 film was deposited by a 1-step method and then post-annealed via a gas-assisted process. The annealing temperature was varied at 35 °C, 60 °C, 75 °C and 100 °C.33 This increase in temperature caused an increase in both the MAPbI3 grain size (to 200, 300, 500 and 700 nm, respectively) and PCE (to 3.8%, 7.9%, 13.0% and 14.1%, respectively). Thus, at lower annealing temperature, MAPbI3 grains possibly contain more defects and residual solvent molecules. Bi et al. reported that FA1−xMAxPbI1−yBry prepared by a 1-step method and then annealed at 80 °C, 100 °C, 125 °C, 150 °C and 180 °C showed a consequent increase in the FA1−xMAxPbI1−yBry grain size to 202 nm, 300 nm, 310 nm, 350 nm and 41 1 nm, respectively, although the PCE varied at 15.8%, 17.6%, 17.2%, 16.6% and 11.6%, respectively.34 The quality of the FA1−xMAxPbI1−yBry grain is therefore involved in the grain size effect.
In the case of parameter (4), namely, the ratio of PbI2/MACl or FAI/MABr, the average grain size of MAPbI3 deposited by a 1-step method was ≈100 nm for a PbI2/MAI ratio of 1:1, ≈300 nm for 1:1.25, and ≈500 nm for 1:1.5.35 These MAPbI3 PSCs with the largest grain size (≈500 nm) had the best PCE (19.4%), whereas that with the smallest grain size (100 nm) yielded a PCE of only 6%. In that study, the perovskite film thickness differed depending on the PbI2/MAI ratio, from 100 nm at 1:1 to 500 nm at 1:1.5. This indicates that the thicker film improved the light absorption. Bi et al. reported that a FAI/MABr ratio of 1:0.88, 1:1.06, 1:1.35, 1:1.52, 1:1.7 and 1:2 resulted in an FA1−xMAxPbI1−yBry grain size of 50, 100, 210, 300, 300 and 310 nm, respectively, and a PCE of 8%, 15.4%, 18.9%, 17.6%, 16.4% and 14.8%.34 The perovskite film thickness differed depending on the FAI/MABr ratio, from 100 nm at 1:0.88 to 1000 nm at 1:2. Thus, the grain size effect could not be separated from the layer thickness effect. Zhang et al. reported MAPbI3−xClx treated with MAI/MACl solution in n-butanol for 3, 5, 7 and 10 treatment cycles.36 The MAPbI3−xClx film showed a corresponding change in the grain size of 300, 847, 363 and 301 nm with a PCE of 10.08%, 17.37%, 16.7% and 15.24%, respectively. The perovskite film thickness differed, namely, 300, 434, 465 and 500 nm, respectively. The total ratio of PbI2/MACl can be increased by increasing the number of treatment cycles. Both the degree of the PbI2 reaction and the unreacted MAI/MACl residue influenced by the treatment cycles possibly affected the perovskite film thickness. Therefore, the ratio of either PbI2/MACl or FAI/MABr is involved in the grain size effect.
As explained above, the effect of the grain size is accompanied by other effects, such as (1) quality of the grains,31,32,34,37 (2) passivation at the grain boundary,17,31,32 (3) thickness of the perovskite film30,35–37 and (4) inner interfaces of mesoporous TiO2.27 Furthermore, some reports revealed that grain boundaries and defects play important roles not only in the PSC performance but also in the stability of planar PSCs.17,34 To understand the fundamental characteristics of PSCs with a stable inorganic ETL, a method must be developed that can clarify the grain size effect alone on both the performance and characteristics of the grain boundary by eliminating any other parameter.
In this study, we propose a method to clarify the direct effect of the grain size on the PSC performance. The average MAPbI3 grain size could be controlled alone by the surface roughness (Rms) of the c-TiO2 layer using the same preparation conditions as that used for MAPbI3. Using this method, we then investigated the effect of the MAPbI3 grain size on the PSC performance in which planar heterojunction PSCs were fabricated by using the structure Au/spiro-OMeTAD/CH3NH3PbI3/c-TiO2/ITO/glass-substrate. The direct dominant effect of the MAPbI3 grain size on the inorganic PSC performance was clearly revealed, in which the grain quality and the MAPbI3 layer thickness were maintained and imperfections such as void formation were prevented in the interface of TiO2.
Experimental
2.1 Solar cell fabrication
A c-TiO2 layer was deposited on ITO substrates for two active areas (0.54 cm2 or 0.16 cm2) by spray pyrolysis as follows. First, ITO glass substrates (5 Ω/□ sheet resistance) were etched with Zn powder and hydrochloric acid (HCl, 1 M), and then cleaned sequentially by ultrasonication first with detergent, then with de-ionized water, and finally with ethanol for 20 min at each step. The resulting ITO glass surface was then exposed to UV light treatment for 1 h. Then, a dense thin film of compact TiO2 was deposited on the ITO substrates using spray pyrolysis at spray temperature Ts = 450 °C. The compact TiO2 solution (0.15 M) was prepared using 2.5 ml of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (TiAcAc) solution (Sigma-Aldrich) in 17.5 ml of a solvent (ethanol (EtOH), propanol (IPA) or 1-butanol) purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry (TCI). Next, each compact TiO2 thin film sample was annealed at a temperature (Ta) of 450 °C for 1 h to remove the organic components to improve the crystallization quality of the thin film.
The planar PSC device structure was fabricated as follows and consisted of 5 layers: (1) ITO glass substrate as a bottom electrode, (2) c-TiO2 layer as an ETL, (3) light-absorbing perovskite film (CH3NH3PbI3), (4) 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis{N,N-di(4methoxyphenyl)amino}-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD, Merck) as an HTL, and (5) a top Au electrode. After the c-TiO2 layer on the ITO substrate was cooled to room temperature, the perovskite film was prepared using a 1-step method developed by Ahn et al.37 In this method, 422 mg of PbI2, 159 mg of CH3NH3I, and 78 mg of DMSO (molar ratio 1:1:1) were mixed by stirring in 600 mg of DMF solution for one hour at room temperature. The completely dissolved solution was spin-coated onto the c-TiO2 layer for the 0.54 cm2 active area samples at 3000 rpm for 30 s with 300 μl of diethyl ether (DEE) as an anti-solvent solution, and for the 0.16 cm2 active area samples at 5000 rpm for 30 s with 300 μl of ethyl acetate (EA). All samples were then annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. Next, the HTL was formed by first dissolving a spiro-OMeTAD solution [80 mg spiro-OMeTAD, 22.5 ml 4-tertbutylpyridine (Sigma-Aldrich) and 17.5 ml lithium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI, Sigma-Aldrich) solution (520 mg Li-TFSI in 1 ml acetonitrile) in 1 ml chlorobenzene], and then spin-coating the resulting solution onto the perovskite film at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, Au (100 nm) was deposited on this HTL by thermal vacuum evaporation to form the top electrode.
2.2 Characterization
The surface and cross-sectional morphologies and the film thickness of the compact TiO2 and MAPbI3 layers were obtained using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JEOL JSM-7001F). The average grain size was determined based on the SEM images of at least 3 locations per sample, and then using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, and the Laboratory for Optical and Computational Instrumentation at the University of Wisconsin). The Rms was measured using atomic force microscopy (AFM, multimodal N3-IHA SPM system, BRUKER) in tapping mode on a homogeneous area (5 × 5 um). The current density and voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PSCs were measured at room temperature using a CEP-2000ML solar cell (Bunkoukeiki) measurement system that included a solar simulator and a source meter (Keithley 2400). The AM 1.5 illumination of 100 mW cm−2 was calibrated based on a standard Si reference cell. All PSCs were scanned at a sweep rate of 150 mV s−1, first in a forward scan under dark current and sun illumination (from short circuit to forward bias), and then in a reverse scan (forward bias to short circuit). The active area (0.54 cm2 or 0.16 cm2) of each PSC was confirmed based on measurements using a shadow mask of the same area.
Results and discussion
3.1 PSC performance
The photovoltaic response under dark current and under sun illumination was investigated here for PSCs with a planar configuration of c-TiO2 consisting of glass/ITO/c-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3(MAPbI3)/spiro-OmeTAD/Au prepared using different solvents (EtOH, IPA and 1-butanol) for the PSCs that have 0.54 cm2 active area. For the PSCs that had the highest PCE among about 20 cells prepared using different solvents for c-TiO2, Fig. 1 shows the J–V characteristics measured under 1-sun illumination (1a) and under dark current (1b), and Table 1 summarizes the measured photovoltaic parameters, namely, open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF) and PCE. The PSCs with EtOH as a solvent showed VOC < 1 V, JSC = 14.21 mA cm−2, FF = 44%, and PCE = 6.1%. Compared with EtOH as a reference, the PSCs with c-TiO2 prepared using either IPA or 1-butanol as a solvent under the optimized conditions of spray pyrolysis at Ts = Ta = 450 °C exhibited significantly enhanced VOC, JSC, and FF, leading to a higher PCE of 9.5 for IPA and 11.4% for 1-butanol.

According to another manuscript in preparation,38 when using EtOH as a solvent, the final c-TiO2 layer showed a rough surface and produced a large number of large TiO2 particles (>10 μm diameter) produced by the spray pyrolysis because the vaporization rate of EtOH is faster than either IPA or 1-butanol. Then, the precursor vaporizes before it reaches the substrate, and solid particles are consequently formed and then precipitate after the chemical reaction in the vapor phase. The result is current leakage partly due to the direct contact between c-TiO2 and either the spiro-OMeTAD HTL and/or the Au electrode. Therefore, VOC (Fig.1a) of PSCs fabricated using EtOH was lower than that using either IPA or 1-butanol. Additionally, the slope of the J–V characteristic curve under dark current (Fig.1b) can be determined by the shunt resistivity. The lower shunt resistivity for the EtOH sample indicates that the PCE was also affected by the large solid particles formed when using EtOH. The comparison between IPA and 1-butanol shows that the highest PCE was achieved using 1-butanol under our experimental conditions.

Fig. 2 shows the cross-sectional SEM images of the PSC samples with different c-TiO2 layers prepared using the three different solvents. As mentioned above, the performance of a PSC with a c-TiO2 layer when using EtOH as a solvent indicate that parameters other than the MAPbI3 grain size also strongly affect the PSC performance. Therefore, c-TiO2 layers using 1-butanol were fabricated next, and then characterized via SEM and AFM imaging to investigate the effect of the MAPbI3 grain size on PSC parameters and to determine the relationship between the c-TiO2 surface roughness (Rms) and the average MAPbI3 grain size.

Fig. 3 shows the representative SEM cross-sectional and corresponding surface images of the ITO/compact TiO2/MAPbI3 layer fabricated using 1-butanol as a solvent, and Fig. 4 shows a correlation plot of the average MAPbI3 grain size estimated from these images. For the different solvents (EtOH, IPA and 1-butanol), the average grain size analyzed from both the surface and cross-sectional images was needed because when a complete cell is fabricated, a surface image of the MAPbI3 layer cannot be obtained using SEM. Analysis of both images showed an average grain size between 200 and 300 nm. The R value of 0.86 (based on the linear equation) shown in Fig. 4 confirms that the average MAPbI3 grain size determined from the cross-sectional images (instead of surface images) can be used to evaluate the effect of the MAPbI3 grain size on PSC photovoltaic parameters. This relationship indicates that the uniform grain growth of the perovskite occurred in the film thickness direction and also shows that the average MAPbI3 grain structure was suitable to investigate the relationship between the grain size and the PSC performance.

3.2 Dominant effect of the MAPbI3 grain size on PSC photovoltaic parameters

Fig. 5a–d show the effect of the MAPbI3 grain size (≈150 to ≈360 nm) on photovoltaic parameters (VOC, JSC and FF) and the PCE for PSCs fabricated using ITO/c-TiO2(1-butanol Ts = Ta = 450 °C)/MAPbI3/spiro-OmeTAD/Au. Five of these PSC samples with the larger active area of 0.54 cm2 (No. 1–5) were randomly selected for comparison of their J–V characteristics with PSCs that had the smaller active area of 0.16 cm2 (randomly selected, No. 6). For comparison, Fig. 6 shows the J–V characteristics for these six samples under 1-sun illumination in a forward scan (6a) and a reverse scan (6b). Table 2 shows the comparison of VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE for these selected samples. These results show that among the PSCs with 0.54 cm2 active area fabricated here, the best PCE (11.4%) was obtained from the reverse scan for sample No. 5, which had the largest MAPbI3 grain size (≈300 nm) for 0.54 cm2. Because PSCs are formed from solution-based processes, MAPbI3 perovskite thin films are polycrystalline and contain grain boundaries. However, the PSC with 0.16 cm2 active area (sample No. 6) had the highest PCE (13.6%) due to the larger grain size of the perovskite film produced by the use of an appropriate anti-solvent and spin coating rate. In particular, regardless of the active area size, both JSC and FF were strongly affected by the average grain size of the MAPbI3 layer (Fig. 5a and c, respectively). For the 0.54 cm2 samples, the highest JSC was 18 mA cm−2 and FF was 0.64, and for the 0.16 cm2 samples, JSC = 21.3 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.6. Thus, the PCE was improved (Fig. 5d).

In contrast, VOC was not strongly affected by the MAPbI3 grain size and ranged between only 1.0 and 1.2 V (Fig. 5b) because the average grain size range was narrow (between 100 and 400 nm). These results agree with a previous study,31 which also showed that an increase in the average grain size (from 100 nm to 500 nm by increasing the stock solution concentration of MAPbI3 from 25 wt% to 55 wt% stock solution) caused an increase in VOC (from 1.0 to 1.3 V) due to the consequent decrease in the trap density. In that previous study, the PSC that had the highest PCE of 19.4% (FTO/compact TiO2/MAPbI3/spiro/Au configuration with active area of 0.09 cm2) exhibited JSC = 23.91 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.08 and FF = 0.75.
Although the improved JSC in that previous study31 was ascribed mainly to the thicker MAPbI3 layer produced by using a 55 wt% stock solution, the grain size effect could not be completely separated from the layer thickness effect and/or the grain quality effect. Our results, however, clearly show that the increased grain size improves the PSC performance only under constant grain quality and layer thickness of MAPbI3. In our study, JSC and FF increased with increasing diffusion length of the carrier due to a decrease in the recombination velocity caused by the larger grain size and/or due to the increased mobility in the polycrystalline perovskite film. The larger grain size mitigates such charge transport and diffusion problems, thereby resulting in higher JSC and FF, thus indicating an efficient increase in the carrier diffusion length inside the cell. The same tendency was observed when determined using the forward scan (Fig. S1†). In this work, the thickness of the c-TiO2 layer was carefully controlled, and thus showed only a slight variation. The effect of this layer thickness on the PSC performance can be considered negligible in these experiments (shown in Fig. S2†).
In this study, we used only conventional MAPbI3 without any additive or doping and with no change in either the formulation or fabrication conditions. The possible methods to increase the grain size reported in studies discussed in the Introduction were used here. For example, the grain size could be controlled by changing one or more of the following parameters: (1) additive ratio in the perovskite film; (2) doping percentage; (3) perovskite formation temperature and (4) ratio of the precursor.

Fig. 7 shows the effect of the average MAPbI3 grain size on the series resistance (Rs) and on the shunt resistance (Rsh) for the PSC samples with 1-butanol as a solvent at Ts = Ta = 450 °C with 0.54 cm2 active area. Here, Rs was determined from the inverse of the slope of the J–V curve (Fig. 6) at VOC when J = 0, and Rsh from that at JSC at V = 0. For the same range of the average MAPbI3 grain size (between 150 and 350 nm), Rs varied between 10 and 90 Ω cm2, while Rsh varied between 0.1 and 1 kΩ cm2. These plots clearly show that when PSCs have a larger grain size (>300 nm), both Rs (Fig. 7a) and Rsh (Fig. 7b) are improved. The larger MAPbI3 grain sizes themselves help improve the carrier mobility and decreases the recombination. A possible explanation for the grain-size dependence of Rsh is that the grain boundary could be relatively resistive and thus be a channel for the shunt current. The same tendency could be observed in the J–V curve in the forward scan under 1-sun illumination (Fig. S3†).

3.3 Surface roughness (Rms) of TiO2 layer versus MAPbI3 grain size
Next, the relationship between the grain size and Rms was investigated. The surface SEM images of the perovskite film and compact TiO2 layers with different average grain sizes are shown in Fig. 8a–d and e–h, respectively. The surface AFM images of c-TiO2 layers are shown in Fig. 8i–l (5 × 5 μm measurement area). The surface AFM 3D images of compact TiO2 layers of different Rms values are shown in Fig. 8m–p. The reduced Rms of the c-TiO2 layer helps promote a larger average MAPbI3 grain size. According to heterogeneous nucleation, the total surface free energy is defined as the sum of the surface free energy and the bulk free energy. The barrier energy or surface energy is one of the significant parameters affecting the nucleation process. When the substrate has a higher surface energy, a low number of nuclei will exist.39 Then, a few nuclei will grow into larger grains compared with the lower surface energy samples. Thus, the surface roughness of c-TiO2 could be one of the parameters that change the surface energy in the heterogeneous nucleation process. Furthermore, the correlation between the average MAPbI3 grain size (200–300 nm) and Rms of the c-TiO2 layer was investigated and shown in Fig. 9. These results confirmed that the average grain size in perovskite films was smaller when Rms of c-TiO2 was increased, which agrees with the concept of nucleation and growth on a flat surface. In conclusion, a surface with low Rms is therefore a highly desired parameter for perovskite films for PSCs for larger grain size and for improved PSC performance.

Conclusions
A clear relationship between the grain size of MAPbI3 and the PSC performance was observed. In PSCs, MAPbI3 grain size is a dominant property in determining the PSC performance. In summary, a high PCE (11.4%) was achieved for a PSC that had a 0.54 cm2 active area and a compact TiO2 layer fabricated using 1-butanol as a solvent by spray pyrolysis at Ts = Ta = 450 °C. This high PCE was due to significantly enhanced JSC (16.4 mA cm−2) and FF (0.64). The highest PCE (13.2%) was observed, in a PSC with a 0.16 cm2 active area, VOC = 1.06 V, JSC = 21.3 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.60. Here, the MAPbI3 grain size could be controlled alone by the surface roughness (Rms) of the c-TiO2 layer using the same preparation conditions used for MAPbI3. The average MAPbI3 grain sizes analyzed from the surface and cross-sectional SEM images were both the same, namely, ranging between 100 and 400 nm, indicating that larger MAPbI3 grain sizes were obtained. Dense MAPbI3 layers with different grain sizes ranging from ≈100 to ≈400 nm were successfully fabricated. The dominant effect of a larger grain size (>300 nm) yielded higher JSC and FF (16.4 mA cm−2 and 0.64, respectively), indicating an increased diffusion length of carriers due to a decrease in recombination velocity and/or an increase in apparent mobility through the grain boundary. The Rms of the c-TiO2 layer clearly affected the average MAPbI3 grain size of planar heterojunction PSCs. When Rms was low (<3 nm), the grain size tended to be larger (>260 nm) due to enough free space for homogeneous crystal growth on this smoother surface and for uniform nucleation. Highly efficient PSCs can therefore be achieved by increasing both the smoothness of the surface of the c-TiO2 layer and the grain size of the perovskite film. An increased MAPbI3 grain size is a target morphology for high efficiency large-area and wafer-size PSCs in commercial modules, where lateral charge carrier diffusion over longer length scales is necessary for charge collection electrodes.
