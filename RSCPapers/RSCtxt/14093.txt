    , Accepted 13th September 2022First published on 14th September 2022AbstractThe reasonable design of electrocatalysts with rapid self-reconstruction for an efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at commercially required current densities is highly desirable but very challenging. Herein, ultrathin Fe-modified Ni hydroxysulfide (Fe–NiSOH) nanosheet arrays were grown in situ on Ni foam via a simple two-step oxidation strategy for efficient and stable large-current-density water/seawater oxidation. Systematic insights, including experimental and theoretical analysis, reveal that in situ S leaching from the electrode boosts its self-reconstruction and results in the more-ready generation of highly active Ni4+ species, which benefits from a reduced formation energy. Owing to its excellent physical and chemical properties, the Fe–NiSOH catalyst requires only low overpotentials of 207, 240, and 268 mV in alkaline water to deliver current densities of 10, 100, and 500 mA cm−2, respectively, and it can work stably for 1100 hours at the commercially required current density of 500 mA cm−2. Furthermore, it also exhibits excellent seawater oxidation activity and superior resistance to Cl− corrosion, since it can run stably at 500 mA cm−2 for over 900 hours. This work offers an efficient strategy to build rapidly self-reconstructing electrocatalysts to promote the formation of highly oxidized metal species for efficient and stable water/seawater oxidation.

Broader context
Hydrogen, an ideal renewable energy carrier with high efficiency and zero-carbon emissions, is expected to play an important role in helping mankind on the road to carbon neutrality. At present, hydrogen mainly comes from fossil fuels, known as ‘grey hydrogen’, which is in conflict with the original purpose of carbon neutrality. Electrochemical water splitting is a ‘green hydrogen’ technology with a simple process and high conversion efficiency, which can be coupled with renewable energy sources (wind, solar power, etc.). Unfortunately, the high cost of precious metal catalysts and the poor efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) limit its large-scale applications. Therefore, it is urgent to develop high-efficiency and low-cost noble-metal-free catalysts for the OER. Despite the good progress achieved in reducing overpotentials, they are still unsatisfactory in terms of the long-term stability at the commercially required current densities. Hence, we report a simple two-step oxidation strategy to fabricate an Fe-modified Ni hydroxysulfide catalyst with rapid self-reconstruction, which exhibits high efficiency and stable water/seawater oxidation capacity with low overpotentials at a large current density. Impressively, it can work stably for over 1100 and 900 hours in alkaline water and seawater, respectively, at the commercially demanded current density of 500 mA cm−2.

Introduction
Hydrogen (H2) originating from electrocatalytic water splitting powered by renewable electricity sources is of high purity and cleanliness, and has been considered one of most effective ways to solve the energy crisis and environmental problems around the world.1,2 Unfortunately, electrochemical water splitting suffers from low energy conversion efficiency due to the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the anode.3 Although noble-metal-based (e.g., Ir and Ru) materials are currently the benchmarks of OER electrocatalysts, their rarity and poor stability prevent their use in large-scale application.4 To address the issue, considerable efforts have been devoted to exploring highly efficient and stable non-precious metal electrocatalysts, such as transition-metal (oxy)hydroxides,5 oxides,6 nitrides,7 phosphides,8 sulfides,9,10 and selenides.11
Among the promising candidates reported so far, the transition-metal (Ni, Fe, Co, etc.) based (oxy)hydroxides are regarded as the most efficient OER catalysts in an alkaline electrolyte.12 Moreover, with the development of in situ or operando characterization techniques, transition-metal (oxy)hydroxides have been identified as the actual active species reconstructed from most original OER catalysts (i.e., pre-catalysts).13,14 Meanwhile, it has also been demonstrated that in situ-generated highly oxidized metal species possess greatly superior activities, by regulating the orbital hybridization between metal d band and O 2p to activate oxygen species for triggering the direct O–O coupling of the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM).15,16 Nevertheless, several challenges still remain, although progress has been achieved in designing efficient electrocatalysts to reduce overpotentials. Firstly, most reconstructed catalysts exhibit a core–shell structure (Table S1, ESI†) owing to limited electrolyte diffusion.17 The reconstructed degree of these catalysts may change with reaction conditions,14,17 which makes their structure and performance unpredictable and hinders an insightful understanding of the reconstruction and catalytic mechanisms. By contrast, catalysts with complete reconstruction are expected to exhibit higher durability due to their more thermodynamically stable components,18 which is important for large-current-density seawater splitting. Besides, most of the self-reconstruction process is slow and energy-intensive, as represented by hundreds of CV cycles or long-term operation under constant potentials or current densities.19,20 Secondly, the deep oxidation of metal species is thermodynamically unfavorable, and high energy consumption is ineluctable during the OER, which hinders the formation of highly oxidized metal species.21,22 Therefore, it is highly desirable to design a pre-catalyst with the ability of rapid and complete self-reconstruction for more ready generation of highly oxidized metal species. Thirdly, despite good OER performance at small current densities (≤100 mA cm−2) being achieved in most reported catalysts, they still face an enormous challenge in terms of the long-term stability at the large current densities required for industrial application.
On the other hand, considering the abundance of seawater on our planet, which accounts for 96.5% of the world's total water, direct seawater electrolysis technology could help to alleviate the shortage of freshwater, especially in arid regions.23,24 However, direct electrolysis of seawater at large current density faces great challenges, including the chlorine evolution reaction (CER) that competes with OER at the anode, the corrosion of electrodes by Cl− ions and microorganisms in natural seawater, and the deposition of insoluble precipitates [Ca(OH)2 and Mg(OH)2] during seawater splitting.7,25 More recently, some progress has been made in seawater oxidation by developing highly efficient catalysts due to the more favorable thermodynamic potential (∼480 mV) of OER in artificial alkaline seawater (pH > 7.5).23,26,27 Nevertheless, most of these catalysts remain catalytically active for only a short time (≤100 hours) in alkaline seawater due to their poor corrosion resistance, especially at high current densities. Therefore, the requirements for effective and durable OER catalysts for long-term seawater electrolysis at large current densities are more demanding, and they must have both high OER activity and excellent corrosion resistance.
To overcome these difficulties encountered in OER electrodes, a pre-catalyst prepared by a simple method has been demonstrated here to achieve rapid self-reconstruction for efficient and stable large-current-density water/seawater oxidation. That is, ultrathin Fe-modified Ni hydroxysulfide (denoted Fe–NiSOH) nanosheet arrays were grown in situ on Ni foam via a facile two-step oxidation strategy for the first time, which exhibit a large surface area for exposing a massive number of active sites as well as a superhydrophilic surface and excellent gas release behavior to facilitate mass transfer. Meanwhile, the nickel foam acts as both a substrate and Ni source to generate the active material, and this facile connection enables the catalyst to be firmly anchored to the substrate, guaranteeing efficient electron transfer and excellent corrosion resistance in alkaline water/seawater. In addition, systematic insights from ex/in situ characterization and DFT calculations reveal that in situ S leaching from the Fe–NiSOH electrode not only accelerates its reconstruction process, but also reduces the formation energy of highly active Ni4+ species, making its formation much easier during activation. Therefore, the Fe–NiSOH catalyst possesses outstanding OER activity in alkaline water/seawater, for which the overpotentials at current densities of 10, 100, and 500 mA cm−2 only require 207, 240, and 268 mV in 1 M KOH as well as 213, 263, and 311 mV in 1 M KOH seawater, respectively. Impressively, the Fe–NiSOH catalyst demonstrates superior potential for industrial application since it can work stably for over 1100 and 900 hours in alkaline water and seawater, respectively, at the commercially demanded current density of 500 mA cm−2.
Results and discussion
A facile two-step oxidation procedure to prepare ultrathin Fe–NiSOH nanosheet arrays is illustrated in Fig. 1a. As the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show, the smooth surface of Ni foam (Fig. S1, ESI†) is etched into many large weedy nanosheet fields (Fig. 1b) after a wet chemical oxidation reaction. The energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) results prove that Ni, S and O are uniformly distributed on these nanosheets to form Ni hydroxysulfide (denoted NiSOH) (Fig. S2, ESI†). In this process, the Ni foam substrate serves as an Ni source for the growth of NiSOH nanosheets and provides close contact between the active materials and the substrate, which ensures efficient electron transport and stability. Further anodization results in the incorporation of Fe into NiSOH for the formation of Fe–NiSOH accompanied by the partial removal of S atoms, with the morphology evolving from large nanosheet fields into many smaller lawns stacked with abundant nanosheets (Fig. 1c). This unique three-dimensional nanostructure provides effective channels for facilitating electrolyte diffusion and the escape of gaseous product, ensuring the stability and activity of the electrode. To determine the optimal condition for anodic oxidation, different current densities and anodic oxidation times were also explored and discussed (Fig. S3 and S4, ESI†). This facile approach is simple and efficient, so that it is easy to scale up from 1 cm2 to 100 cm2 (Fig. S5, ESI†), demonstrating great potential for practical applications. Moreover, S-free Fe–Ni–OH nanosheet arrays were also prepared by the same process using pure nickel hydroxide (Ni–OH) nanosheet arrays as the precursor (Fig. S6 and S7, ESI†).

(d) A HRTEM image (the inset is the selected area electron diffraction pattern) and (e) a dark field TEM image with corresponding elemental mapping of Fe–NiSOH. 
The phase information for the self-supporting electrodes was analyzed via X-ray diffraction (XRD). It was found that no obvious diffraction peaks can be detected in the XRD patterns of the NiSOH and Fe–NiSOH electrodes (Fig. S8, ESI†), perhaps due to the influence of their poor crystallinity and the signals of the Ni foam substrate (PDF#4-850) being too strong. As for Ni–OH (Fig. S9, ESI†), the XRD pattern mainly matches with α-phase Ni(OH)2·0.75H2O (PDF#38-715) and Ni(OH)2 (PDF#14-117). After anodization, the diffraction peaks for Fe–Ni–OH become very weak, possibly due to the incorporation of Fe or the partial oxidation of Ni(OH)2, resulting in an increase in structural disorder. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was further applied to study the structure and element distribution of Fe–NiSOH. There are no obvious lattice fringes in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the Fe–NiSOH nanosheet (Fig. 1d and Fig. S10, ESI†) due to its poor crystallinity. This can also be verified by the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (inset, Fig. 1d), which is consistent with the XRD results. Fig. 1e exhibits the dark field TEM (DFTEM) image of the Fe–NiSOH catalyst and its EDX elemental mapping images of Fe, Ni, O, and S, demonstrating the uniform distribution of these four elements in each nanosheet within the fields. Furthermore, as the EDX mapping results show in Fig. S11 (ESI†), the atomic ratio of Fe:Ni:O:S is close to 1:1.5:11.2:0.3, where the amount of S is about 1.97%.
The vibrational modes of the as-prepared catalysts were investigated by Raman spectroscopy. The Raman spectrum of the NiSOH electrode possesses two vibration modes located at approximately 291 and 454 cm−1 assigned to vibration modes of Ni–S and Ni–OH bonds, respectively, while the S-free Ni–OH catalyst displays only the Ni–OH stretching mode of Ni(OH)2 at 462 cm−1 (Fig. S12, ESI†).28–31 After the incorporation of Fe, the Fe–NiSOH electrode exhibits three new characteristic peaks attributed to amorphous FeOOH: the Fe–OH stretching mode at about 304 cm−1 and the Fe–O vibration modes at about 532 and 675 cm−1 (Fig. 2a).32–34 As for the S-free Fe–Ni–OH, a new vibration mode appears at around 497 cm−1, assigned to the Ni–O bands associated with the presence of disordered or defective Ni(OH)2.35,36 This implies that incorporation of Fe induces partial lattice defects in the Ni–OH catalyst, which is in line with the XRD results. The surface chemical valence states of the electrodes were studied via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As the high-resolution XPS spectra of Ni 2p show in Fig. 2b, the two characteristic peaks of Fe–Ni–OH located at about 856.20 and 873.95 eV are attributed to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2, respectively, while there is a positive shift of around 0.19 eV for the two peaks of Fe–NiSOH. As for the Fe 2p spectra (Fig. 2c), two peaks at around 711.78 and 724.62 eV for Fe–Ni–OH can be assigned to Fe3+ 2p3/2 and Fe3+ 2p1/2, respectively,25,37 and there is also a positive shift of around 0.22 eV for the two peaks of Fe–NiSOH. Moreover, their valence states and electronic structures were investigated by the absorption-edge position of the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra.38 Compared with Fe–Ni–OH, a higher absorption edge position in both Ni and Fe K-edge XANES spectra for Fe–NiSOH suggests that S atoms modulate the electronic structure around the metal atoms (Fig. S13, ESI†), which is in line with the XPS results. Besides, the O 1s XPS spectra (Fig. 2d) show that both catalysts possess metal–oxygen (M–O) bonds and metal–hydroxide (M–OH) bonds at around 530.95 and 531.82 eV, respectively, and the peak for Fe–NiSOH at around 532.85 eV is assigned to chemisorbed water on the electrode surface (H2O).39–41 Abundant M–OH bonds indicate that metal hydroxides are the main components for both catalysts, while the M–O bonds come from metal oxyhydroxides. The S 2p XPS spectrum of Fe–NiSOH exhibits two peaks located at about 162.70 and 163.88 eV assigned to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively, while the two peaks at about 169.02 and 170.05 eV correspond to S–O bonds (Fig. S14, ESI†), which may result from residual sulfate groups during the preparation process, or surface partial oxidation when exposed to air.25 Additionally, the Ni 2p XPS spectra (Fig. S15, ESI†) and the absorption edge position of Ni K-edge XANES spectra (Fig. S16a, ESI†) for NiSOH also exhibit positive shifts compared with those for Ni–OH, suggesting the modification of electronic structures by S atoms.

The local coordination structures of the four catalysts were investigated by k3-weighted Fourier transform extended X-ray absorption fine structure (FT-EXAFS) spectra (Fig. 2e, f and Fig. S16b, ESI†), and the first-shell fitting results are displayed in Fig. S17–S19 and Tables S2, S3 (ESI†). Compared with the Ni–O path at approximately 2.04 Å for Ni–OH, NiSOH exhibits Ni–O and Ni–S paths at about 2.02 and 2.26 Å, respectively. After anodizing, the coordination environment of the first shell for Fe–Ni–OH remains almost unchanged, while Fe–NiSOH possesses an Ni–O path at 2.02 Å and an Ni–S path at 2.29 Å at the first-shell pathway. Besides, Fe–NiSOH shows a decreased average coordination number (CN) for the Ni–S path and an increased average CN for the Ni–O path compared with NiSOH, indicating that some of the S atoms are removed and replaced by oxygen atoms or hydroxyl groups during anodic oxidation. As for the coordination structures of Fe, there is only an Fe–O path at approximately 1.98 Å in both Fe–NiSOH and Fe–Ni–OH, assigned to Fe oxyhydroxide.42 Remarkably, combining all the chemical structure characterizations, it can be concluded that the Fe–NiSOH catalyst mainly consists of Fe-incorporated Ni hydroxysulfide and Fe oxyhydroxide, while Fe-doped Ni hydroxide and Fe oxyhydroxide are the main components of the Fe–Ni–OH catalyst.
The oxygen evolution catalysis of the as-prepared samples was firstly conducted in 1 M KOH. As presented in Fig. 3a, the Fe-modified catalysts show significantly enhanced OER activity compared with NiSOH and Ni–OH, illustrating that Fe modification improves the OER activity. For further detailed comparison, Fig. 3b displays the overpotentials of these catalysts at different current densities. Obviously, Fe–NiSOH requires only a very low overpotential of 207 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is much superior to those of Fe–Ni–OH (259 mV), NiSOH (297 mV), Ni–OH (387 mV), or benchmark IrO2 (258 mV). As for the larger current densities of 100 and 500 mA cm−2, the overpotentials for Fe–NiSOH are only 240 and 268 mV, respectively, much lower than those for the other electrodes and commercial IrO2. Considering the large surface area of the Ni foam substrate, its total pore area was measured by the mercury intrusion method, and the normalized activity of the catalysts is shown in Fig. S20 (ESI†). The LSV curves were further normalized by loading mass of the catalysts, and the Fe–NiSOH electrode possessed the best OER mass activity with overpotentials of 215, 239, and 264 mV to achieve current densities of 10, 50, and 200 A g−1, respectively, much superior to those of other electrodes (Fig. S21, ESI†). Additionally, the OER performance of Fe–NiSOH with different anodizing current densities and times are also compared in Fig. S22 and 23 (ESI†), and Fe–NiSOH exhibits the best OER activity, which confirms the optimal anodic oxidation conditions. Moreover, Fe–NiSOH possesses a relatively small Tafel slope of 33.5 mV dec−1, which is smaller than those of Fe–Ni–OH (63.3 mV dec−1), NiSOH (86.2 mV dec−1), Ni–OH (150.8 mV dec−1), or IrO2 (67.7 mV dec−1), demonstrating its rapid OER catalytic kinetics (Fig. 3c). Therefore, the Fe–NiSOH catalyst possesses outstanding OER catalytic activity, which also outperforms most reported electrocatalysts (Table S4, ESI†).

(a) Polarization curves at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1, (b) overpotentials at different current densities, (c) Tafel plots, and (d) Nyquist plots (overpotential = 310 mV) of as-prepared electrodes in 1 M KOH. (e) Polarization curves and (f) overpotentials of the four electrodes at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 in 1 M KOH seawater. (g) Chronopotentiometry curves of Fe–NiSOH at a current density of 500 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH and 1 M KOH seawater. 
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was further conducted to study the OER kinetics of the fabricated samples. As the Nyquist plots presented in Fig. 3d show, Fe–NiSOH possesses the smallest charge transfer resistance (Rct) of 0.98 Ω, suggesting its excellent conductivity and outstanding interfacial electron transfer kinetics, which are beneficial for improving the OER efficiency. The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) can be used to estimate the actual number of exposed active sites and intrinsic activity of the electrodes, which is estimated by the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) derived from the CV curves at different scan rates (Fig. S24, ESI†).9 As illustrated in Fig. S25a (ESI†), Fe–NiSOH possesses a larger Cdl of 2.48 mF cm−2 than those of Fe–Ni–OH (1.88 mF cm−2), NiSOH (1.80 mF cm−2), or Ni–OH (1.43 mF cm−2). This implies that Fe–NiSOH achieves the largest ECSA and exposes more active sites, which are beneficial for boosting the OER process. Furthermore, the OER LSV curves normalized by ECSA are shown in Fig. S25b (ESI†). It was found that the Fe–NiSOH catalyst achieves the largest current densities at the same overpotentials, determining its highest intrinsic activity. In addition, the Fe–NiSOH catalyst exhibits the largest turnover frequency (TOF) value of 0.0630 s−1 at an overpotential of 250 mV (Fig. S26, ESI†), much higher than those of any other electrodes at the same or even higher overpotential (350 mV), indicating its highest intrinsic OER activity. Therefore, in comparison with the other catalysts, both the number of active sites increases and the intrinsic activity is improved for the Fe–NiSOH electrode. Additionally, as shown by the contact angle (CA) of the electrodes displayed in Fig. S27 (ESI†), the Fe–NiSOH catalyst possesses a superhydrophilic surface with the smallest CA, which indicates that it has a strong adhesion force to the electrolyte, thus facilitating the adsorption and pyrolysis of reactants. The bubble releasing behavior of the Fe–NiSOH and Fe–Ni–OH catalysts was also investigated (Fig. S28, ESI†), where bubbles adsorb on the surface of the Fe–Ni–OH catalyst due to its superaerophilicity (Video S1, ESI†), while the Fe–NiSOH electrode exhibits weak adhesion to the bubbles, allowing the gaseous product to escape quickly (Video S2, ESI†). These indicate that the Fe–NiSOH catalyst possesses superior mass transfer kinetics for facilitating the OER process, especially at large current density.43,44
We further evaluated the performance of the electrodes in artificial alkaline seawater (1 M KOH seawater). As the polarization curves of the four electrodes in Fig. 3e show, the Fe–NiSOH electrode still displays the best OER activity among these catalysts, with low overpotentials of 213, and 263 mV to drive the current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3f), respectively. Moreover, Fe–NiSOH requires only a very low overpotential of 311 mV to deliver the commercially demanded current density of 500 mA cm−2, which is well below the maximum overpotential of 480 mV required to trigger CER for forming hypochlorite. Therefore, an excellent OER selectivity can be realized for Fe–NiSOH in an H-type electrolytic cell with 1 M KOH seawater, as evidenced by the average oxygen faradaic efficiencies (FE) of 97.8% and 97.6% at current densities of 100 and 500 mA cm−2, respectively (Fig. S29, ESI†). The outstanding OER activity of the Fe–NiSOH electrode in alkaline seawater is much superior to those of most reported electrocatalysts for seawater oxidation (Table S5, ESI†).
Long-term durability is another key index to assess the performance of an electrode in practical applications. The stability investigation of the Fe–NiSOH catalyst was operated at different constant current densities in alkaline water/seawater. As illustrated in Fig. S30 (ESI†), the Fe–NiSOH catalyst exhibits excellent stability in 1 M KOH, almost without a decrease in OER activity at current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm−2 during 100 h of operation. What is more, the Fe–NiSOH electrode exhibits excellent OER efficiency with an average O2 FE of 98.9% at a constant current density of 100 mA cm−2 (Fig. S31, ESI†). The SEM image shown in Fig. S32 (ESI†) shows that the nanosheet structure of used Fe–NiSOH remains good after 100 h of OER operation. Its corresponding Raman spectrum exhibits δ(Ni–O) and ν(Ni–O) vibration modes of NiOOH at 474 and 553 cm−1,45,46 and Fe–O vibration modes of FeOOH at 687 cm−1, indicating the formation of the more active NiOOH in Fe–NiSOH during the OER process (Fig. S33, ESI†). Very impressively, the Fe–NiSOH catalyst can work stably at the commercially demanded current density of 500 mA cm−2, and there is only about a 40 mV increase for the required potential after 1100 h of continuous testing, in which the periodic small fluctuation of the curve is caused mainly by the temperature difference between day and night as well as water supplements (Fig. 3g). Although the OER activity of the Fe–NiSOH catalyst is not the best compared to published results, few catalysts have been reported to run stably for such a long time at commercial current densities (Table S4, ESI†). Moreover, the Fe–NiSOH catalyst also possesses excellent stability at a constant current density of 100 mA cm−2 in alkaline seawater (Fig. S34, ESI†), almost without obviously increased overpotentials during 100 h of seawater oxidation, suggesting good resistance to chlorine corrosion. Besides, the nanosheet structure of the Fe–NiSOH electrode after the stability test remains good, where several new elements (such as Mg, Ca, Na, Cl, etc.) come from the natural seawater (Fig. S35, ESI†). More importantly, the Fe–NiSOH catalyst can operate stably for over 900 hours at the commercially demanded current density of 500 mA cm−2, with an increase in the overpotential of only 49 mV (Fig. 3g), indicating its superior stability and corrosion resistance in seawater. The Cl− corrosion resistance abilities of the four electrodes were analyzed in-depth via corrosion polarization curves in natural seawater (Fig. S36, ESI†), and the lowest corrosion current density for the Fe–NiSOH electrode suggests its highest resistance to Cl− corrosion in seawater. In addition, almost no ClO− was produced in the electrolytes after the stability test, as detected by the N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPD) method (Fig. S37, ESI†), suggesting its excellent OER selectivity. Therefore, the Fe–NiSOH electrode possesses highly efficient OER activity and excellent durability for alkaline seawater electrolysis at large current density, both of which outperform most reported electrodes (Table S5, ESI†). Moreover, the Fe–NiSOH electrode still exhibits outstanding stability and OER selectivity in 1 M KOH seawater even when the potential exceeds the threshold potential for the ClO− formation reaction (1.72 V vs. RHE),47 and can work stably for 80 hours at an extremely large current density of 2 A cm−2 (Fig. S38, ESI†), demonstrating a record excellent OER performance in alkaline seawater under large current densities.
Furthermore, a two-electrode electrolyzer for overall water splitting (Fig. S40a, ESI†) was assembled in alkaline water/seawater via pairing the Fe–NiSOH electrode with a previously reported CoP nanorod arrays electrode (Fig. S39, ESI†) with good HER activity.32 As expected, the Fe–NiSOH//CoP electrolyzer requires small cell voltages of 1.527, 1.618, and 1.703 V to deliver current densities of 10, 100, and 500 mA cm−2, respectively, in 1 M KOH (Fig. S40b and c, ESI†). Additionally, the electrolyzer also exhibits excellent overall-seawater-splitting activity with low cell voltages of 1.553, 1.674, and 1.808 V to drive current densities of 10, 100, and 500 mA cm−2, respectively. Furthermore, the Fe–NiSOH//CoP electrolyzer displays excellent stability in alkaline water and seawater at constant current densities, with almost no decrease in catalytic activity (Fig. S40d, ESI†), showing promising application prospects. After long-term overall water/seawater splitting at large current density, the smooth nanorod structure of the CoP electrode becomes rough, and the significantly reduced phosphorus content implies that metallic Co was formed on the surface of the CoP (Fig. S41, ESI†), which may contribute to the high activity and stability of the electrolyzer.1 In addition, the signals of Ca and Mg elements can be detected in the CoP after overall seawater splitting, suggesting the Ca(OH)2 and Mg(OH)2 precipitations were deposited on the surface of the cathode.
It is worth noting that the OER activity evaluations determine the superiority of Fe–NiSOH among the Fe-involved catalysts in alkaline water/seawater. The redox electrochemistry of both catalysts was firstly conducted to investigate the structure–activity correlations. As the steady CV curves show in Fig. 4a, both catalysts display obvious oxidation peaks attributed to the Ni2+ → Ni3/4+ oxidation process, along with the Ni(OH)2 → NiOOH transformation.15,48 However, the Fe–NiSOH catalyst possesses extremely large oxidation peak areas in comparison with those of Fe–Ni–OH, implying their diverse reconstruction behaviors. Ex situ characterizations were conducted to study the Fe–NiSOH and Fe–Ni–OH catalysts after 20 CVs (denoted Fe–NiSOH–CV and Fe–Ni–OH–CV, respectively), and the CV curves are shown in Fig. S42 (ESI†). As the Raman spectra show in Fig. 4b, Fe–NiSOH–CV is completely converted into active NiOOH and FeOOH, indicating the time-saving and energy-efficient reconstruction behaviors. By contrast, only a new ν(Ni–O) vibration mode for NiOOH at about 550 cm−1 shows up for Fe–Ni–OH–CV besides the original vibration modes of Ni(OH)2, implying that only a small amount of Ni(OH)2 is converted to NiOOH, which is consistent with the CV curves. The formation of more NiOOH in the Fe–NiSOH catalyst is accompanied by the disappearance of S, which can be seen in the high-resolution XPS spectra for S 2p (Fig. 4c). There is no S 2p peak even after etching the surface layer via an argon ion beam for 25 s, suggesting the complete leaching of the S species from the Fe–NiSOH catalyst. Meanwhile, the Ni 2p XPS spectrum displays a positive shift of approximately 0.19 eV for Fe–NiSOH–CV compared with those for Fe–Ni–OH–CV, suggesting a higher valence state of Fe–NiSOH–CV, in accordance with the formation of more NiOOH (Fig. 4d). As for Fe 2p, the Fe–NiSOH–CV catalyst exhibits two spin–orbit doublets of Fe3+ 2p3/2 and Fe3+ 2p1/2, while the Fe–OH–CV catalyst exhibits two characteristic peaks of Fe2+ 2p3/2 and Fe2+ 2p1/2 at about 710.54 and 723.99 eV, respectively (Fig. 4e).49–51 As for the XPS spectra of O 1s, Fe–NiSOH–CV displays the greatly increased M–O/M–OH peak area ratio (SM–O/SM–OH) of 2.09 in comparison with the Fe–Ni–OH–CV having that of 1.36, suggesting more transformation from hydroxides to oxyhydroxides in Fe–NiSOH–CV due to S leaching (Fig. 4f). Moreover, there is a small number of lattice fringes with interplanar spacing of 0.209 nm in the HRTEM image of Fe–NiSOH–CV (Fig. 4g), ascribed to the (105) plane of γ-NiOOH (PDF#6-75). The EDX results display the uniform distribution of Fe, Ni, O, and K for the Fe–NiSOH–CV catalyst, and the negligible amount (an atomic ratio of about 0.08%) of the S element determines its complete leaching during in situ reconstruction. Therefore, these ex situ characterizations systematically demonstrate that in situ sulfur leaching promoted the conversion of the Fe–NiSOH catalyst to more OER-active species, namely γ-NiOOH, thus ensuring excellent OER activity.

To better gain insight into the reconstruction process of the catalysts and determine the real active intermediates, more in-depth structural characterizations of the catalysts were performed through in situ measurements. In situ Raman (Fig. 5a) was firstly carried out to reveal the real-time reconstruction of the electrodes during the OER process, collected from open circuit potential (OCP) to 1.515 V vs. RHE. As for the S-free Fe–Ni–OH (Fig. 5b), no noticeable reconstruction occurs when the potentials are below 1.365 V vs. RHE, where the original peak at 499 cm−1 cannot be detected, mainly owing to the influence of Ni–OH vibration modes. When the potential reaches 1.415 V vs. RHE, the Ni–OH peak at 463 cm−1 becomes weak and the peak at 499 cm−1 can be observed. Additionally, a new peak appears at 553 cm−1, ascribed to the ν(Ni–O) vibration modes of NiOOH,35 indicating the partial transformation from Ni(OH)2 to NiOOH. The intensity ratio of these two peaks at 553 and 463 cm−1 (I553/463) was used to roughly determine the degree of phase transition (Table S6, ESI†). The value of I553/463 remains about 0.60 at 1.515 V vs. RHE, suggesting the S-free Fe–Ni–OH was reconstructed into a complex of Ni(OH)2 and NiOOH, with the oxidation from Ni2+ to Ni2–3+. As for the Fe–NiSOH catalyst, when operated at OCP, there are two tiny characteristic peaks at about 471 and 527 cm−1 attributed to the δ(Ni–O) of NiOOH and Fe–O vibration mode of FeOOH,52 respectively, suggesting rapid reconstruction behavior. The intensity of these two peaks gradually increases with the increase in potential until they are replaced at 1.365 V vs. RHE by two distinct characteristic peaks at approximately 474 and 556 cm−1, corresponding to well-defined δ(Ni–O) and ν(Ni–O) vibration modes of NiOOH.46,53 This indicates the complete transformation of the Ni-species into NiOOH. The peak of the Fe–O vibration mode becomes invisible due to overlap with these two strong bands, which is consistent with previous work reported by Hu's group.52 Generally, γ-NiOOH exhibits a higher peak intensity ratio of δ(Ni–O) to that of ν(Ni–O) (denoted Iδ/ν) compared with β-NiOOH, due to its looser structure.54,55 Meanwhile, the average valency of Ni in γ-NiOOH is +3.6, which means the presence of highly oxidized Ni4+ species.56,57 It is worth noting that the value of Iδ/ν for the Fe–NiSOH catalyst is as high as 1.9–2.1 during the reconstruction process, suggesting the formation of γ-NiOOH with Ni4+ (Table S7, ESI†). Moreover, the Iδ/ν value reduces slightly with the increase in applied potential originating from the structural defects and lattice disorder owing to incorporation of Fe.35,52,55 Therefore, it can be inferred that in situ S leaching induces the formation of highly oxidized Ni4+ in the Fe–NiSOH catalyst. Furthermore, the lower formation potential of NiOOH for the Fe–NiSOH catalyst reveals that S leaching decreases the reconstruction barrier and thus promotes complete reconstruction.

The in situ XAS of the two catalysts was detected at 1.5 V vs. RHE to reveal the valent states and coordination environments of the metals during OER. For the Ni K-edge XANES spectra (Fig. 5c), there is a positive shift of approximately 2.7 eV for the absorption edge of Ni XANES spectra in the Fe–NiSOH catalyst compared with that in the Fe–Ni–OH catalyst with Ni2–3+, which is consistent with previous reports of Ni2+ being oxidized to Ni3–4+.42,58 This shift implies the formation of highly oxidized Ni4+ in Fe–NiSOH during OER, in accordance with the in situ Raman results. Moreover, Fig. 5d illustrates the FT-EXAFS peaks of Ni with a shift to the lower R direction, indicating the formation of shorter Ni–O bonds in the Fe–NiSOH catalyst during the OER process. The fitting results exhibits an average Ni–O bond length of 1.87 Å for the Fe–NiSOH catalyst at 1.5 V vs. RHE (Fig. S43 and Table S2, ESI†), assigned to Ni3–4+,59,60 while the average Ni–O bond length of 2.04 Å for the Fe–Ni–OH catalyst corresponds to Ni2–3+.56 Additionally, compared with the initial fresh Fe–NiSOH electrode, the Ni–S path disappears and the CN of the Ni–O path decreases slightly, demonstrating that S leaches and then vacancies are left during reconstruction process, which may lower the energy barrier for the formation of Ni4+. As for the Fe K-edge (Fig. 5e), both catalysts exhibit the absorption edge of Fe3+,60,61 indicating that the valence states of Fe-species in the two catalysts are unchanged in the OER process. Furthermore, the two catalysts have the same Fe–O paths at the first shell (Fig. 5f, Fig. S44 and Table S3, ESI†), in agreement with that of FeOOH in the freshly prepared catalysts. It is worth noting that Fe–Ni–OH–CV contains only Fe2+ species based on the XPS results, from which it can be inferred that the Fe-species in Fe–Ni–OH–CV is reversible, and Fe2+ in the resting state is oxidized to Fe3+ before OER. This can be proved from the Raman spectra of the CV-activated catalysts after 24 h of exposure to air, where Fe–Ni–OH–CV transforms back to the initial phase, suggesting the instability of its reconstructed active phase (Fig. S45, ESI†). In contrast, Fe–NiSOH–CV possesses stable reconstituted active species with unchanged characteristic peaks. Therefore, all the ex/in situ characterizations reveal that in situ S leaching accelerates the self-reconstruction process and induces the formation of highly oxidized Ni4+. With that in mind, the dynamically generated Ni4+ species play a decisive role in OER activity, and can be considered as real active sites in this system.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to investigate the role of S leaching during activation on generating highly oxidized Ni4+ species. Ni(OH)2, S-doped Ni(OH)2 [S–Ni(OH)2], and S-doped Ni(OH)2/FeOOH [S–Ni(OH)2/FeOOH] were optimized as original models (Fig. S46, ESI†), and S atoms were further removed to form S-leached (SL) catalysts (Fig. S47, ESI†). Fig. 6a presents the free energy diagram from Ni2+ to Ni3–4+ for Ni species in the catalysts (Fig. S48, ESI†) during self-reconstruction. The transformation from Ni(OH)2 to NiOOH requires energy of 1.24 eV, while lower energy is required for Ni2+ in SL S–Ni(OH)2 (1.16 eV) and SL S–Ni(OH)2/FeOOH (1.11 eV) to be oxidized to Ni3+. Very impressively, SL S–Ni(OH)2 and SL S–Ni(OH)2/FeOOH need only 0.76 and 0.69 eV, respectively to form highly oxidized Ni4+, much lower than that of Ni(OH)2 (1.16 eV). This illustrates that S leaching can accelerate the conversion of Ni(OH)2 to NiOOH and greatly reduce the formation energy of Ni4+. Besides, the incorporation of Fe can further optimize both processes, in line with the experimental results. Therefore, the Fe–NiSOH catalyst can easily generate more active Ni4+ species during self-reconstruction benefitting from the favorable effect of sulfur leaching, thus achieving excellent catalytic activity. In general, compared with Ni3+, the higher oxidized Ni4+ 3d band easily embeds more deeply in the O 2p band due to the stronger electron transfer from metal to oxygen atoms, resulting in the rise of the O 2p band to increase unoccupied electronic states and generate ligand oxygen holes (Fig. 6b).62,63 This phenomenon can also be observed in this catalyst system from the projected density of states (PDOS) of SL NiOOH/FeOOH during deprotonation (corresponding to Ni3+, Ni3–4+, Ni4+, respectively) (Fig. S49, ESI†). As the amount of highly oxidized Ni4+ increases, the metal d-band center (εd) gets further and further away from the Fermi level, while the p-band center gradually shifts to higher energy (Fig. 6c and Table S8, ESI†). Additionally, the proportion of O 2p component (the ratio of the state number of O 2p to total orbital) apparently increases, especially above the Fermi energy, suggesting increased unoccupied electronic states and the formation of ligand oxygen holes. These active oxygen species can be experimentally detected by in situ Raman spectra. A broad vibration mode between 850 and 1150 cm−1 begins to appear at 1.36 V vs. RHE with the formation of Ni4+ for Fe–NiSOH, corresponding to active oxygen species (Ni–OO−),64,65 but it does not show up for Fe–Ni–OH (Fig. S50, ESI†). These activated lattice oxygen ions can trigger the direct O–O coupling of LOM that overcomes the thermodynamic limitations of the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), thereby enhancing OER activity.66,67 To further verify whether the lattice oxygen of the catalysts participates in the OER cycling process, 18O isotope-labelled experiments were carried out.68–70In situ Raman spectra in Fig. S51a and b (ESI†) exhibit that the 18O–NiOOH peaks of 18O-labelled Fe–NiSOH immediately shift back to the position of 16O–NiOOH within 1 min, while that of the 18O-labelled Fe–Ni–OH shows only a small shift after 20 min. Moreover, the mass spectrometry (MS) results in Fig. S51c (ESI†) reveal that the 18O-labelled Fe–NiSOH can generate 18O-labelled products (16O18O), of which only a very small amount is detected in the 18O-labelled Fe–Ni–OH. These straightforward pieces of evidence strongly confirm the LOM in the OER cycling for the Fe–NiSOH electrode. It should be noted that, although O-isotope exchange can also be observed in the Fe–Ni–OH electrode, the extremely weak phenomenon suggests that it mainly follows the AEM pathway rather than the LOM.

Combining all the experimental and theoretical results, the excellent water/seawater oxidation performance of the Fe–NiSOH electrode can be ascribed to the following features. (1) The nickel foam substrate provides a Ni source to directly generate the active materials, and their tight connection endows the Fe–NiSOH catalyst with excellent electron transport and corrosion resistance capacity, resulting in its long-term operation in alkaline water/seawater. (2) Most importantly, in situ S leaching from the Fe–NiSOH electrode boosts its self-reconstruction process, and leads to more ready generation of highly active Ni4+ species due to the reduced formation energy, thus achieving excellent intrinsic OER activity. (3) Fe–NiSOH possesses a large surface area for exposing a massive number of active sites as well as a superhydrophilic surface and excellent gas release behavior for facilitating mass transfer, both of which are significant for efficient and stable water/seawater oxidation under high current densities.
Conclusions
In summary, this work develops a unique two-step oxidation strategy to fabricate ultrathin Fe–NiSOH nanosheet arrays grown in situ on Ni foam. Systematic insights reveal that the electrode possesses a large surface area for exposing a massive number of active sites, a superhydrophilic surface and excellent gas release behavior for facilitating mass transfer, a tight connection with the Ni foam substrate for excellent corrosion resistance, and more-readily formed Ni4+ species due to in situ S leaching for enhanced intrinsic OER activity. Therefore, the Fe–NiSOH catalyst shows outstanding OER activity and robust durability in alkaline water/seawater, operating stably over long periods of time at the commercially required current density of 500 mA cm−2. This work provides an efficient strategy for constructing excellent OER catalysts rapidly with more readily formed highly oxidized metal species, which will significantly promote the development of alkaline water/seawater splitting for commercial applications.

Broader context
Hydrogen, an ideal renewable energy carrier with high efficiency and zero-carbon emissions, is expected to play an important role in helping mankind on the road to carbon neutrality. At present, hydrogen mainly comes from fossil fuels, known as ‘grey hydrogen’, which is in conflict with the original purpose of carbon neutrality. Electrochemical water splitting is a ‘green hydrogen’ technology with a simple process and high conversion efficiency, which can be coupled with renewable energy sources (wind, solar power, etc.). Unfortunately, the high cost of precious metal catalysts and the poor efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) limit its large-scale applications. Therefore, it is urgent to develop high-efficiency and low-cost noble-metal-free catalysts for the OER. Despite the good progress achieved in reducing overpotentials, they are still unsatisfactory in terms of the long-term stability at the commercially required current densities. Hence, we report a simple two-step oxidation strategy to fabricate an Fe-modified Ni hydroxysulfide catalyst with rapid self-reconstruction, which exhibits high efficiency and stable water/seawater oxidation capacity with low overpotentials at a large current density. Impressively, it can work stably for over 1100 and 900 hours in alkaline water and seawater, respectively, at the commercially demanded current density of 500 mA cm−2.
