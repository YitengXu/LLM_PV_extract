    , Accepted 15th August 2018First published on 16th August 2018AbstractMnO2 nanoparticles were uniformly loaded on the surface of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF-67 and ZIF-8) with ligand modification via a facile method with no other impurities introduced, with an average diameter of less than 10 nm. The MnO2/ZIF-COOH composites with stable structures can effectively alleviate expansion tension and provide a fast ion transport channel during electrochemical performance tests. The introduction of carboxyl (–COOH) increases the specific capacity due to Li insertion, enhances the conductivity with ionization, and improves stability through the formation of H-bonds. When used as an anode for lithium ion batteries, the MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH composite exhibits an excellent rate performance (1208 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1, 931 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1, 828 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1, 684 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1, 566 mA h g−1 at 1000 mA g−1, 431 mA h g−1 at 2000 mA g−1, and 242 mA h g−1 at 5000 mA g−1) and high cycle stability even at high rates (a high capacity of 664 mA h g−1 is achieved at 1000 mA g−1 and is maintained at approximately 100% after 100 cycles).
1. Introduction
With the growing consumption of energy, energy storage is a challenge faced by the general public. Moreover, sustainable and renewable energy resources such as wind power and solar power are unreliable.1 Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), with effective energy storage, have been applied in various fields, such as electric vehicles (EVs), mobile phones, aerospace, and so on.
In order to improve the energy density of LIBs, great efforts have been made to explore various novel materials, and transition-metal oxides (MOx) are among them.2 Manganese dioxide (MnO2) is a promising material with high theoretical specific capacity (∼1230 mA h g−1) and low cost. However, pure MnO2 is not an ideal anode material due to its low electrical conductivity and rapid capacity drop. This can be ascribed to the expansion and aggregation of MnO2 during the discharge/charge process.3 Therefore, there have been numerous studies concentrating on MnO2 composites in LIBs to address this issue. Carbon nanohorn-supported MnO2 anodes were developed by Huang et al., and a specific capacity of 565 mA h g−1 at 450 mA g−1 after 60 cycles (42 wt% MnO2) was obtained.4 Xia et al. used nanoflakey MnO2/carbon nanotube nanocomposites as anode materials, which obtained a specific capacity of 620 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1 after 50 cycles.5 Recently, MnO2 nanoscrolls/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanocomposites were reported by Liu et al.,2 with a specific capacity of 528 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA h g−1. Based on the previous literature, it seems that MnO2 composite materials as anode materials are superior to pure MnO2, however the energy and power density of these composite materials are too low for any practical applications.
MOFs are porous materials with a high pore volume, high specific area and inorganic–organic hybrid properties with an ordered microporous structure, and are favorably superior as an ideal matrix for metals,10,11 oxides12,13 and hydrides.1 Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are one subclass of metal–organic framework (MOF) made by the linking of metal ions and organic ligands.6–8 ZIF-67 and ZIF-8 have been extensively studied due to their great chemical and thermal stability as well as their adjustable pore sizes, unique adsorption and catalytic properties.1,9 Based on the fact that the metal ions in MOFs can serve as redox active sites in electrochemical processes, MOFs can be used as electrode materials in LIBs. However, MOF materials usually have low electrical conductivity which greatly affects their electrochemical performance in LIBs. Therefore, we focused on MnO2/MOF composites, which may have excellent electrochemical properties due to the splendid MOF structure.
In this paper, a novel method was applied to prepare MnO2/ZIF-COOH composites. This method can not only uniformly load nanoparticles of MnO2 on ZIF-67 and ZIF-8, but can also increase the length of the ligand, transforming methyl (–CH3) to carboxyl (–COOH), which can also change the characteristics of a material. Taking ZIF-67 as an example, this reaction is presented by eqn (1):14,15 Co-(2IM)2 + KMnO4 → Co-(2IC)2 + MnO2(1)IM: methyl imidazole; IC: imidazole carboxylic acid.
Under the conditions of an ice bath, smaller particles were produced with a low speed. The nanoparticles can improve the electrochemical performance of MnO2. It is worth mentioning that no impurity was observed. The MOFs (ZIF-67 and ZIF-8) not only alleviate the expansion tension of the material, but also offer solid frameworks for fast electron transport.16 Furthermore, the stability of the MOFs can be promoted due to the formation of carboxyl groups (–COOH), which can build H-bonds through interaction. The simulation model of an H-bond between two carboxyl (–COOH) groups is shown in Fig. S1.† The as-synthesized MnO2/ZIF-COOH composites were used as anode materials in LIBs, which exhibited a superior electrochemical performance compared to pure MOFs, and the monodispersion of MnO2 on MOFs by the oxidation of ligands was made possible.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Chemicals
All chemicals were of analytical grade and were used as purchased without further purification.

Synthesis of ZIF-67 and ZIF-8. 
ZIF-67 and ZIF-8 were prepared through a solvothermal method developed by the Yaghi group.17 10 mmol nitrites (cobalt nitrate or zinc nitrate) and 100 mmol 2-methylimidazole were dissolved in 20 ml N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) in a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave (50 ml). Solvothermal synthesis was carried out at 90 °C for 72 h. The powder product was collected by centrifugation (6 min at 5000 rpm) and washed thoroughly using DMF and methanol. The obtained ZIF-67 (purple) and ZIF-8 (white) powders were dried at 100 °C for 12 h before further experiment.


Synthesis of MnO2 nanoparticles. 
2-Methylimidazole (0.03 g) and KMnO4 (0.02 g) were dissolved in 30 ml deionized water in a flask (100 ml). With continuous magnetic stirring in an ice bath, the mixture was allowed to react for 12 h. The black product was collected by centrifugation (6 min at 5000 rpm) and washed thoroughly using deionized water. The obtained MnO2 powders were dried at 100 °C for 12 h before further experiment.


Preparation of the MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH composite. 
ZIF-67 (0.05 g) was dispersed in 10 ml deionized water with stirring in an ice bath (designated as solution A). KMnO4 (0.01 g) was dissolved in 10 ml deionized water and was introduced dropwise into solution A with vigorous stirring. After 30 min, brown precipitate was collected by centrifugation (12000 rpm, 10 min) and cleaned thoroughly by DI water washing. Then, the obtained powder was dried (under vacuum at 100 °C for 12 h).


Preparation of the MnO2/ZIF-8-COOH composite. 
The method was almost the same as the method for the MnO2/ZIF67-COOH composite, except ZIF-8 was used rather than ZIF-67.

2.2 Characterization of materials
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Deutschland BRUKERD2 PHASER X-Ray Diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å). Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded in the range of 400–4000 cm−1 on a Nicolet AVATAR 370 infrared spectrometer. The MnO2 content of the MnO2/ZIF-COOH composites was analyzed by an inductively coupled plasma spectrometer (ICP, Prodigy, Leeman). N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the as-prepared samples were collected on a Micromeritics ASAP 2460 analyzer at 77 K. Both the specific surface area and pore size distribution were calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were captured on a Hitachi S-3400-N scanning electron microscope. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and energy-dispersive spectra (EDS) were collected on a Hitachi H-800 transmission electron microscope equipped with an EDS spectrometer.
2.3 Electrochemical measurements
CR 2032 coin cells were used to study the electrochemical properties of the as-prepared materials in lithium-ion cells. The active materials were mixed with acetylene black (AB) and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), with a weight ratio of 70:20:10. The mixtures were ground for 3 h after adding a moderate solvent, N-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP), dropwise. The resultant slurries were uniformly cast onto a copper foil substrate. After drying under vacuum at 90 °C for 12 h, the electrodes were assembled into cells in a glove box filled with argon. The mass loadings of the MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH composite and the MnO2/ZIF-8-COOH composite were 1.19 and 1.12 mg, respectively. The anode was Li, and the electrolyte was 1 M LiPF6 in 1:1 v/v ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC). The electrochemical measurements of cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were carried out with a CHI660D electrochemical workstation, both of which were measured before the tests. Charging/discharging curves were recorded on a NEARE CT-3008 with the voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V (vs. Li/Li+) at the rate range from 0.05 C to 5 C (C = 1000 mA g−1) at room temperature. Furthermore, the cycle performance of the materials was recorded after the rate tests.
3. Results and discussion
The synthesis route for the MnO2/ZIF-COOH composites is presented in Scheme 1. An ice bath was chosen to maintain the structures of the MOFs with tiny MnO2 particles formed at a relatively low speed. The content of MnO2 can be regulated by the introduction of KMnO4, and a series of tests were conducted to explore the optimum recipe of KMnO4 and the MOFs. However, it was found from the XRD patterns that the MOFs are prone to collapse with an increase in KMnO4, so a proportion was chosen in the synthetic method. The reaction time was also explored, and 30 min was a period of time that ensured experimental repeatability. Moreover, the chemical compositions of MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH and MnO2/ZIF-8-COOH were measured by ICP, and the mass ratios of MnO2 were 0.19 and 0.18, respectively. To verify the purity of the product, the XRD patterns of ZIF-67 and ZIF-8 were collected and compared in Fig. 1(a) and 2(a), respectively. It was observed that the XRD pattern of ZIF-67 matches well with that of the simulated ZIF-67. The difference in peak intensities can be attributed to the crystal morphology.18 Several characteristic peaks of ZIF-67 can be observed in the XRD pattern of the MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH composite which indicated the presence of ZIF-67 after the redox reaction. It should be noted that the peak intensities of ZIF-67 in the MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH composite were much lower than those of pure ZIF-67, which can be attributed to the partial amorphization of ZIF-67 during the redox reaction and the formation of MnO2. The two broad humps marked by black hearts in the XRD pattern of the MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH composite match well with those of MnO2 (JCPDS no. 72-1982). Moreover, some peaks of MnO2 overlapped with the peaks of ZIF-67. From Fig. 2(a), it can be seen that there is no obvious difference before and after loading MnO2 on ZIF-8, other than that the intensity of the MnO2/ZIF-8-COOH composite at around 35° is higher than that of pure ZIF-8. This is mainly attributed to the introduction of amorphous MnO2, which is demonstrated by the TEM and mapping images of the MnO2/ZIF-8-COOH composite. The conversion of methyl groups in the MOFs (ZIF-67 and ZIF-8) to –COOH groups can be observed in the IR spectra (Fig. 1(b) and 2(b)). The most obvious distinction between the original ZIF-67 and MnO2 supported on ZIF-67-COOH is an extra peak at 1634 cm−1 in the MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH composites (1621 cm−1 in the MnO2/ZIF-8-COOH composites), which is characteristic of carboxylate groups (–COO−).19 Specifically, the broad band at 3451 cm−1 can be attributed to the stretching vibration of O–H. The distinct peak at 3132 cm−1 corresponds to the N–H stretching vibration of imidazole. The stretching vibration of saturated C–H is exhibited at 2932 cm−1. The peak at 1577 cm−1 is ascribed to the CC bond of imidazole. The existence of C–H testifies that KMnO4 can oxidize the methyl groups on the external surface of the ZIF crystals (ZIF-67 and ZIF-8).

The morphologies of ZIF-67 and the MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH composite are revealed by the SEM and TEM images in Fig. 1(c–j). As shown in Fig. 1(c), the particle size of the original ZIF-67 crystals was 500–600 nm. From the SEM and TEM images of the MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH composite in Fig. 1(d) and (e), it can be seen that the diameter of the MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH composite was 600–650 nm, which could be attributed to the deposition of the MnO2 particles. To thoroughly investigate MnO2 loading on ZIF-67, a high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of the MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH composite was produced and is shown in Fig. 1(f). It can be observed that MnO2 nanoparticles with a diameter less than 10 nm were uniformly distributed on the surface of the ZIF-67 crystals. The uniform distribution of the MnO2 nanoparticles on ZIF-67-COOH was further demonstrated by the corresponding elemental mapping results, as shown in Fig. 1(g–j). Since there were no obvious morphology changes shown for the ZIF-67 crystals, the framework integrity of ZIF-67 might be protected, as verified by the XRD results shown in Fig. 1(a). The morphologies of ZIF-8 and the MnO2/ZIF-8-COOH composite are shown in Fig. 2(c–i). From the EDX results of the MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH composites, it can be seen that there is no residual elemental potassium (from KMnO4), whereas the elements C and Cu are from the copper grid.20
To further compare the porosities of ZIF-67 and the MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH composite, N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms and pore size distributions were recorded and are presented in Fig. 3(a and b). The BET surface area of original ZIF-67 is 1381 m2 g−1, which is consistent with results previously reported in the literature.9 However, the BET surface area of the MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH composite is only 216 m2 g−1, which is much smaller than that of original ZIF-67. The adsorption average pore diameter of ZIF-67 is about 2.1 nm, which is smaller than that of the MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH composite (4.9 nm). Both these phenomena can further demonstrate that MnO2 has been loaded on ZIF-67. The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms and pore size distributions of ZIF-8 and the MnO2/ZIF-8-COOH composite are presented in Fig. 3(c and d), which are in accordance with those of ZIF-67 and the MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH composite as the BET surface area of ZIF-8 after loading MnO2 is 1170 m2 g−1 compared to 1315 m2 g−1 of pure ZIF-8. The adsorption average pore diameter of the MnO2/ZIF-8-COOH composite is 2.4 nm, comparable with 2.1 nm of pure ZIF-8. It can be found that although there are no distinct changes in BET data before and after MnO2 loading, there are identical trends in the BET surface area and adsorption average pore diameter of the MOFs before and after MnO2 loading.

Fig. 4(a, c and e) show the CV curves of MnO2, ZIF-67, and the MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH composite in the first three cycles with a cut-off voltage of 0.01–3.0 V. Since the ligands transformed from –CH3 to –COOH in this synthesis method, the reaction mechanism of MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH shifted, intuitively seen from the CV curves of ZIF-67 and MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH. As for the CV curves of ZIF-67 (Fig. 4(c)), the intense cathodic peaks at 1.5 V in the first cycle were absent in the following two cycles, which may be due to the formation of an SEI film. Three broad peaks at 1.0 V, 0.75 V, and 0.45 V existed in all three cycles, which suggested that the framework of ZIF-67 was not damaged and only the extraction and insertion of Li ions proceeded with excellent reversibility. These broad redox peaks implied a gradual multistep insertion of Li ions.21 It has been reported that there are strong interactions between the N atoms of imidazole (IM) and Li atoms,22 which explains the entering and diffusion of Li ions in the porous structure of the ZIF-67 crystals.
 Fig. 4  The galvanostatic charge/discharge curves and cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of (a–b) the MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH composite, (c–d) ZIF-67, and (e–f) MnO2. 
For the CV curves of MnO2 (Fig. 4(e)), a cathodic peak at 0.3 V and an anodic peak at 1.15 V can be associated with the reversible redox reaction of Mn(0) and Mn(IV). The decomposition of the electrolyte and the formation of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film were accomplished at 0.3 V.
The CV curves of the MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH composite are shown in Fig. 4(a). In the first cycle, a little reduction peak at 1.7 V and a broad hump at 1.0–1.7 V were observed, which can be attributed to the amorphization of the ZIF crystals, and the intercalation of Li ions in the ZIF-67 crystals.19,23 The intense cathodic peaks at 0.8 and 0.9 V could be attributed to the intercalation of lithium ions in ZIF-67, the formation of a new phase including Mn(0) and Li2O,5,24 and the interaction of –COOH and Li.25,26 The small peak at around 0.5 V might be due to lithium intercalation in ZIF-67 and the formation of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film.27,28 Two oxidation peaks at 1.0–1.75 and 1.75–2.25 V were observed in the first cycle, suggesting two-step oxidation in the electrochemical oxidation reaction. The first peak at 1.0–1.75 V was in accordance with the oxidation of Mn(0) and the lithium de-intercalation of ZIF-67, while the second peak at 1.75–2.25 V can be attributed to the decomposition of lithium formate.19 The redox reaction of the MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH composite can be described by eqn (2) and (3):26,29–32 MnO2 + 4Li+ + 4e− ↔ Mn(0) + 2Li2O(2) Co-(2IC)2 + Li+ + e− ↔ Li-(2IC)2-Co(3)
In the following two cycles, the reduction peak at 0.5 V disappeared, indicating that the formation of the SEI film only occurred in the first cycle. The two reduction peaks at 0.80 and 1.25 V can be attributed to the structure reconstruction induced by the formation of Li2O and Mn(0). These broad redox peaks suggested a gradual multistep of the Li-insertion process.21 The CV curves of the following two cycles overlapped very well, suggesting the excellent electrochemical reversibility of the MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH composite.
It should be pointed out that the integrity of ZIF-67 was retained after the interaction and de-intercalation of Li ions in the ZIF crystals, which can be attributed to the excellent stability of the ZIF-67 crystals.29 The results can further testify that part of the specific capacity of the MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH composite can be ascribed to the Li-insertion of –COOH. The difference in potential between pure ZIF-67 and the MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH composite can be put down to the ligand transformation of ZIF-67, which changed the characteristics of ZIF-67. The initial discharge and charge capacities of the MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH composite at 50 mA g−1 were 1952 and 948 mA h g−1 (in Fig. 4(b)), respectively, which were much higher than those of pure ZIF-67 (646 and 230 mA h g−1, in Fig. 4(d)) and pure MnO2 (1087 and 269 mA h g−1, in Fig. 4(f)). This initial capacity loss is likely due to the irreversible formation of SEI films.33,34 The second discharge and charge capacities of the MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH composite were still 1005 and 914 mA h g−1, and the discharge and charge curves of the third cycle were almost the same as those of the second cycle. This reveals that the electrochemical performance of the MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH composite was substantially improved compared to pure ZIF-67 and MnO2, which may be attributed to its special structure. It is a synergy of the high theoretical capacity of MnO2, the stable framework of ZIF-67, and the lithiation sites from the –COOH groups.25 The galvanostatic charge/discharge curves and CV curves of the MnO2/ZIF-8-COOH composite are shown in Fig. 6(b) and Fig. S4,† which exhibited similar trends to those of the MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH composite. In the first cycle, a reduction peak at 1.75 V can be derived from the amorphization of ZIF-8. The broad reduction peak at 0.65 V might be attributed to the following factors: the multistep insertion of Li ions in the ZIF-8 crystals due to the interaction of Li ions and N atoms in the organic ligands, the reduction of MnO2 and the formation of –COOLi. Since the CV curves of the second and third cycles were identical, it can be concluded that the redox reactions after the first cycle were reversible. The reaction peak at 0.35 V, derived from the formation of the SEI film, was absent in the second and third cycles, which indicated that this reaction only occurred in the first cycle. This can be verified by the big capacity loss after the first charge–discharge cycle.
Rate and cycle performances are of great importance for electrodes of LIBs. It can be clearly seen that the MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH composite had an outstanding electrochemical rate performance (Fig. 5(a)). The average discharge specific capacities were 1208, 931, 828, 684, 566, 431 and 242 mA h g−1 at 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000 and 5000 mA g−1, respectively, and the corresponding Ragone plot is shown in Fig. S5.† Moreover, the specific capacity of the MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH composite was 998 mA h g−1 after reducing the cycling current to 50 mA g−1, which suggests that the composite material was so stable that it could survive multiple rate cycles. It should be noted that the cycle performance at 1000 mA g−1 was tested after the rate performance test and the first columbic efficiency even reached almost 100% (Fig. 5(b)). Although a declining trend was observed during the first 10 cycles, the discharge specific capacities of the MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH composite began to level off after these cycles. The discharge specific capacity was 664 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 1000 mA g−1. During the 100 cycles, the coulombic efficiencies were always close to 100%. The cycle performances of the MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH composite at 2000 and 5000 mA g−1 are shown in Fig. S6.† After 100 cycles, the discharge specific capacities were still 581 and 246 mA h g−1 at current densities of 2000 and 5000 mA g−1, respectively. This superior performance can be attributed to the synergy of MnO2 and ZIF-67-COOH. The excellent electrochemical performance of the MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH composite can be uncovered by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and the corresponding equivalent circuit model35 as shown in Fig. 5(c and d). Rs, RSEI, and Rct are the internal resistance of this system, the resistance of the SEI surface and the charge-transfer resistance, respectively. Zw represents the Warburg resistance during lithium diffusion. CPE1 and CPE2 are the constant phase element of the SEI film and the interface of the electrode and electrolyte, respectively. In the high frequency region, there is a semicircle corresponding to RSEI and CPE1.3,36 The semicircle in the medium-frequency is attributed to Rct and CPE2.37–39 The Warburg resistances in the lower frequency region revealed the speed of ion diffusion. The kinetic properties of the samples were analyzed using ZSimWin software, and the impedance data were fitted to the equivalent circuit, as shown in Fig. 5d. There should be two semicircles in the Nyquist plots, however the semicircles corresponding to RSEI and CPE1 were not distinct in the high frequency region, which relates to the reaction kinetics of these samples, and the major factor in the electrochemical tests is the charge transfer between Li and these samples. It can be seen that the diameter of the MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH composite was smaller than that of pure ZIF-67 or MnO2, suggesting that the composite had better conductivity. This result can be attributed to the ionization of –COOH in 2-IC.

From Fig. 6(a and b), it can be clearly seen that the specific capacity of ZIF-8 after loading MnO2 is higher than that of pure MnO2, which is consistent with the results of the MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH composite. The rate performance and cyclic stability of the MnO2/ZIF-8-COOH composite are shown in Fig. 6(c) and (d). The average discharge specific capacities were 883, 306, 204, 109, 78, 57 and 26 mA h g−1 at 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000 and 5000 mA g−1, respectively. The specific capacity of the MnO2/ZIF-8-COOH composite was 330 mA h g−1 when the cycling current density reduced to 50 mA g−1, suggesting a high stability of the composite during multiple rate cycles. The MnO2/ZIF-8-COOH composite was so stable that the specific capacity did not apparently decline, remaining at 248 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles.

Most notably, although ZIF-67 and ZIF-8 are isostructural, there are significant differences with regards to their electrochemical performance. This result can be traced back to the property differences of ZIF-67 and ZIF-8. The metal cation of ZIF-67 is Co, different from the Zn of ZIF-8. From the original report of ZIF-67 and ZIF-8,8 it is known that their density of metal atoms per unit volume (T/V(T/nm3)) is different, as the T/V of ZIF-67 is larger than that of ZIF-8. Moreover, from the EIS patterns shown in Fig. 6(e), the charge transfer resistance of the MnO2/ZIF-8-COOH composite (1016 Ω) is significantly larger than that of the MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH composite (44 Ω). The charge transfer resistances were obtained from the equivalent circuit using the ZSimWin software. Since the charge transfer between the Li ions and these samples might be the major factor in the electrochemical tests (shown by the absence of the semicircle in the high frequency region), it is not a surprise that a poor electrochemical performance was obtained for the MnO2/ZIF-8-COOH composite, compared with the MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH composite.
Since the electrochemical performance of the MnO2/ZIF-COOH composites is superior to that of the pure MOFs, it can be speculated that the electrochemical performance of MOFs can be improved by loading MnO2 on the surface of MOF crystals. The electrochemical performance of the MnO2/ZIF-COOH composites is superior to that of pure MnO2, demonstrating that MOFs, to a certain extent, can prevent the aggregation of MnO2 particles and improve electrical conductivity. Based on the SEM images of the MnO2/MOF composites shown in Fig. S7,† no obvious difference was observed before and after discharge and charge, demonstrating the great stability of ZIFs during the lithiation and de-lithiation processes. The FTIR spectra (Fig. S8†) also show that there is little change for the carboxylate groups after 10 cycles, suggesting that the reaction (–COOH → –COOLi) should be electrochemically reversible. This result is consistent with previous studies.40–43
4. Conclusions
In summary, the simultaneous conversion of the surface methyl groups of ZIF-67 and ZIF-8 crystals to carboxylate groups and the uniform deposition of MnO2 nanoparticles on the crystal surface were realized by a simple facile post-modification method. The obtained MnO2/ZIF-COOH composites, as anode materials in lithium ion batteries, exhibited a superior electrochemical performance over pure MnO2 and ZIFs. This improvement can be attributed to the synergy of the following factors. ZIF crystals offered solid frameworks which alleviated the volume expansion of the anode material. The uniform deposition of MnO2 particles provided a high specific capacity. The presence of –COOH groups enhanced the interaction with Li ions, which significantly improved conductivity compared with pure ZIFs. The outstanding stability of ZIF materials also contributed to the long term stable performance.
Compared with the MnO2-ZIF-67-COOH composite, the MnO2-ZIF-8-COOH composite exhibited a substantially lower performance due to its low charge transfer resistance, which came from the low density of metal atoms per unit volume of ZIF-8. The best result was obtained with the MnO2/ZIF-67-COOH composite as an anode material for LIBs, which had a high specific capacity of 664 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 1000 mA g−1. The post-treatment method can be extended to the synthesis of other metal oxide/ZIF-COOH materials, which should have great potential as anode materials for LIBs.
