    , Accepted 13th February 2012First published on 8th March 2012AbstractIn the design of efficient sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), it is vital to modulate the HOMO and LUMO orbitals by introducing suitable donor and acceptor groups. In this respect, triphenylamine has been extensively used as the donor group. Porphyrin has strong absorption in the UV-Vis range, which makes it a promising dye candidate. In addition, a porphyrin molecule contains eight β positions and four meso-positions, which may be conveniently utilized for introducing multiple donor and acceptor moieties. In this work, various numbers of triphenylamine and trimethoxyphenyl groups are introduced to the porphyrin meso-positions as electron donors, with the aim to systematically modulate the energy levels and investigate the effect on the efficiency of the DSSCs. The HOMO–LUMO energy gaps remain almost constant irrespective of the donor groups, thus, the variation of the donors leads to a contradictory effect on the processes of electron injection and dye regeneration. In the case of the zinc porphyrin with two triphenylamine units and one trimethoxyphenyl group as the electron donors (M3T2P), moderate and well-matched HOMO and LUMO energy levels are observed, thus affording high efficiencies for both the electron injection and the dye regeneration processes. The overall conversion efficiencies (η) of the DSSCs based on these dyes lie in the range of 2.70–5.45%, with the optimized performance achieved by M3T2P, which can be rationalized by the efficient electron injection and dye regeneration processes, and the long electron lifetime, as demonstrated by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. These results provide further insights into the strategy for elevating the efficiencies of DSSCs, especially those based on porphyrins, simply by modulating the electron donor groups.
Introduction
The utilization of inexhaustible solar energy is a key to meeting a rapidly increasing global demand for clean and renewable energy sources. In this respect, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are promising devices as an alternative to the traditional silicon based solar cells. The most developed DSSC dyes are based on ruthenium polypyridyl complexes which show a power conversion efficiency up to 11%.1 The advantages of such ruthenium complexes include broad absorption in the near-UV and visible regions and appropriate excited-state oxidation potentials for electron injection into the conduction band of the commonly used semiconductor TiO2.2 However, the cost and environmental concern of ruthenium complexes limit their wide applications and encourage the exploration of cheaper and safer dyes. Thus, much effort has been devoted to the development of new efficient organic dyes for practical use because of their low cost, high molar absorption coefficients, and facile modification of the molecular structures. Highly efficient organic dyes are typically composed of a donor–π-conjugated unit–acceptor (D–π–A) framework with a well defined architecture.3 Thus, organic dyes based on coumarin, triphenylamine (TPA), thiophene, polyene, cyanine, hemicyanine, squaraine and phthalocyanine moieties have been explored as potential sensitizers for DSSCs.4–10 In this respect, we have developed various efficient dyes incorporating indoline, isophorone and benzothiadiazole units.11 In the photosynthetic cores of bacteria and plants, solar energy is collected by chromophores based on porphyrin, and the captured radiant energy is converted efficiently to chemical energy. Inspired by nature, porphyrins have attracted increasing interest as DSSC sensitizers. They have rigid macrocyclic structures, exhibiting strong absorption in the visible region12 and electron transfer kinetics indistinguishable from those of the efficient ruthenium polypyridyl complexes. More importantly, because of their multiple reaction sites, including four meso and eight β-positions, their optical, electrochemical, and photophysical properties can be easily modulated by the peripheral substitutions and inner metal complexations.13,14 Thus, numerous porphyrins have been synthesized and used as sensitizers for DSSCs,15–17 with the highest conversion efficiency of 11.9%,17 which has even surpassed the records for the DSSCs based on ruthenium sensitizers. Nevertheless, high performance porphyrin sensitizers are still relatively scarce.
In the design of dye molecules, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), and the HOMO–LUMO energy gap are among the most important parameters dominating the dye performance in DSSCs. Generally, the HOMO and LUMO orbitals of solar cell sensitizers should match the corresponding energy levels of the electrolyte and the conduction band (CB) of the TiO2 electrode, thus ensuring efficient dye regeneration and electron injection processes. In addition, the HOMO–LUMO band gap should also correspond to a suitable absorption wavelength for harvesting sunlight. In the case of porphyrins, the electronic structure is influenced considerably by the electron donors introduced into the meso-positions.15 In principle, the tuning of the HOMO and LUMO levels could be achieved through the choice of suitable donor groups.18 Such tuning effects on the photovoltaic performance of porphyrin based DSSCs have not been fully investigated. For the purpose of investigating the effects of the meso-donor groups on the cell performance, here we designed and synthesized a series of novel porphyrin sensitizers T2P, T3P, MT2P, MT3P and M3T2P (Scheme 1). In each of the dyes, a 4-ethynylbenzoic acid group was attached to one of the meso-positions as the electron-withdrawing and anchoring moiety, and various numbers of triphenylamine and trimethoxyphenyl groups were introduced to the rest of the meso-positions as the electron donors. Interestingly, a systematic tuning of the HOMO–LUMO levels could be effectively achieved. M3T2P shows the best photovoltaic performance with the overall conversion efficiency (η) of 5.45%, associated with relatively high Jsc and Voc values resulting from the suitable HOMO and LUMO levels in combination with the long electron lifetime.

Experimental section
Materials and reagents
All reagents and solvents were obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification unless otherwise noted. THF was dried over 4 Å molecular sieves, and distilled under nitrogen from sodium benzophenone prior to use. Tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) was vacuum-dried for 48 h. The transparent FTO conducting glass (fluorine-doped SnO2, transmission >90% in the visible range, sheet resistance 15 Ω square−1) and the TiO2 paste was purchased from Geao Science and Educational Co. Ltd. The FTO conducting glass was washed with a detergent solution, deionized water, acetone, and ethanol successively under ultrasonication for 20 min before use.
Equipment and apparatus

1H NMR spectra were obtained using a Bruker AM 400 spectrometer. HRMS were performed using a Waters LCT Premier XE spectrometer. UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary 100 spectrophotometer and fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer. The cyclic voltammograms of the dyes were obtained in acetonitrile with a Versastat II electrochemical workstation (Princeton Applied Research) using 0.1 M TBAPF6 (Aldrich) as the supporting electrolyte, the sensitizer attached to a nanocrystalline TiO2 film deposited on the conducting FTO glass as the working electrode, a platinum wire as the counter electrode, and a regular calomel electrode in saturated KCl solution as the reference electrode. The scan rate was 100 mV s−1.
Photovoltaic measurements employed an AM 1.5 solar simulator equipped with a 300 W xenon lamp (model no. 91160, Oriel). The power of the simulated light was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 using a Newport Oriel PV reference cell system (model 91150 V). I–V curves were obtained by applying an external bias to the cell and measuring the generated photocurrent with a model 2400 source meter (Keithley Instruments, Inc. USA). The voltage step and delay time of the photocurrent were 10 mV and 40 ms, respectively. Action spectra of the incident monochromatic photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) for the solar cells were obtained with a Newport-74125 system (Newport Instruments). The intensity of monochromatic light was measured with a Si detector (Newport-71640). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of all the DSSCs were performed using a Zahner IM6e Impedance Analyzer (ZAHNER-Elektrik GmbH & CoKG, Kronach, Germany). The frequency range is 0.1 Hz–100 kHz. The magnitude of the alternative signal is 10 mV.
Fabrication of the solar cells
The preparation of TiO2 electrodes and the fabrication of the sealed cells for photovoltaic measurements were performed following the procedures previously reported by Grätzel and co-workers.19 A screen-printed double layer of TiO2 particles was used as the photoelectrode. A 10 μm thick film of 13 nm sized TiO2 particles was first printed on the FTO conducting glass, which was kept in a clean box for 5 min, and then dried at 125 °C over 6 min, and further coated by a 4 μm thick second layer of 400 nm light-scattering anatase particles. Finally, the electrodes coated with the TiO2 pastes were gradually sintered in a muffle furnace at 275 °C for 5 min, at 325 °C for 5 min, at 375 °C for 5 min, at 450 °C for 15 min and at 500 °C for 15 min, respectively. The size of the TiO2 film was 0.28 cm2. These films were immersed into a 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min, washed with water and ethanol, and then heated again at 450 °C for 30 min followed by cooling and then dipping into a 0.2 mM porphyrin/ethanol solution for 12 h at room temperature. The counter electrode was prepared by sputtering with three drops of 0.02 M H2PtCl6 in 2-propanol followed by annealing treatment at 400 °C for 15 min. A hole (0.8 mm diameter) was drilled in the counter electrode. The perforated sheet was cleaned by ultrasound in an ethanol bath for 10 min. For the assembly of DSSCs, the dye-covered TiO2 electrode and Pt counter electrode were assembled into a sandwich type cell and sealed with a hot-melt gasket of 25 μm thickness made of ionomer Surlyn 1702 (DuPont). A drop of electrolyte solution was put in the hole in the back of the counter electrode, and introduced into the cell via vacuum backfilling. Finally, the hole was sealed using a UV-melt gum and a cover glass. The electrolyte solution contains 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII), and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in a mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (volume ratio 1:1).

Results and discussion
Synthesis
In general, highly efficient DSSC dyes have a push–pull structure. Triarylamine (TPA) moieties have been widely used as electron donors due to their strong electron-donating ability.20 Alkoxyl groups are weaker electron donors than TPA moieties and stronger than alkyl groups.21 Accordingly, for the purpose of gradually increasing the electron-donating ability, various numbers of TPA and methoxyl groups were combined and introduced to afford the target porphyrin dyes (Scheme 2). The meso-substituted porphyrin intermediates 1a–1d were prepared by TFA-promoted condensation of corresponding dipyrromethanes and aldehydes in CH2Cl2. For the synthesis of 1e, methanol was added to suppress the scrambling process, but the reaction at room temperature afforded no product. Thus, the reaction mixture was refluxed for 48 h, and 1e was obtained in 4.6% yield.

Ethyne bridges have been shown to allow efficient conjugation and strong electronic interaction between chromophores, and to provide a well-defined and rigid structural arrangement.22 In view of this, 4-ethynylbenzoic acid is selected as the electron-acceptor and the anchoring group, which might facilitate electron transfer from the excited dye to the TiO2 surface and would lead to an improved energy conversion efficiency. The ethynyl group was attached to the meso-position via Sonogashira coupling reactions in satisfactory yields. The NMR and HRMS spectra of the intermediates and the target porphyrins are shown in the ESI† (Figs. S1–S50).
Absorption properties in solutions and on TiO2 films
The UV-visible absorption spectra of the porphyrins in THF are shown Fig. 1a. All the porphyrin dyes exhibit the typical features of a porphyrin ring, with an intense Soret band in the range 400–500 nm and less intense Q bands in a range from 550 to 750 nm. As expected, the absorption bands are sensitive to the substituents. With increasing number of electron donors, the Soret and Q bands are broadened and red-shifted. Thus, T3P and MT3P exhibit slightly broader absorption bands at longer wavelengths, compared with other porphyrins. For the fluorescence spectra in THF (Fig. 1b), the trend for the variation of the emission wavelength (Table 1) is similar to that of the absorption bands.12c

Fig. 2 shows the absorption spectra of the porphyrins in THF and on 5 μm thick TiO2 films. All of the porphyrins show comparable absorptions on the TiO2 films. Generally, when sensitizers are anchored onto a nanocrystalline TiO2 surface, the deprotonation and H-aggregates will result in a blue-shift, while J-aggregates usually lead to a red-shift. Compared with the solution spectra, the Soret and Q bands of the porphyrin/TiO2 films were only slightly shifted but considerably broadened relative to the solution spectra. In addition, the presence of the blue shoulders of the Soret bands was observed. These observations can be related to H-type aggregation of the porphyrins on the TiO2 surfaces.23 The broadened absorption bands and the red-shifted absorption onset of the thin-film samples afford increased light-harvesting and better utilization of the long-wavelength light.

Electrochemical properties
For a typical DSSC sensitizer, suitable HOMO and LUMO orbitals are required to enable efficient dye regeneration and electron injection processes. To evaluate this possibility, the cyclic voltammograms (Fig. 3) were recorded in acetonitrile, and the data are summarized in Table 2. The HOMO energy levels lie in the range between 0.75 and 1.10 V with the sequence of T2P ≈ T3P < M3T2P < MT2P ≈ MT3P. It is interesting that the variation in the number of the triphenylamine donor groups caused very little changes in the HOMO energy levels. Thus, T2P and T3P have almost equal values. On the other hand, the introduction of electron-donating methoxy groups to the triphenylamine rings has pronounced effects. Thus, MT2P and MT3P have significantly higher HOMO energies than those of T2P and T3P. In the molecule of M3T2P, a moderate electron donor, a trimethoxyphenyl unit is directly introduced onto the meso position, which results in a moderate HOMO energy level.24 The LUMO energy levels for these compounds have a similar variation trend. These results clearly indicate that the energy levels could be conveniently tuned by the variation of the donor groups. The LUMO levels (Fig. 4) of the porphyrins are more negative than the conduction edge (–0.50 V vs. NHE) of TiO2, which implies that the electron injection from the excited states of the dyes to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 is possible. On the other hand, the HOMO levels are more positive than the oxidation potential for the I−/I3− redox couple (+0.40 V vs. NHE), indicating that the oxidized dyes generated by the electron injection process could thermodynamically accept electrons from I− ions to regenerate the dyes. Thus, these porphyrins may serve as sensitizers for DSSCs.

 Fig. 4  Schematic energy-level diagram of the porphyrins. LUMO is estimated by subtracting E0–0 from HOMO. 
It is noteworthy that for all the porphyrin dyes, the HOMO–LUMO energy gaps remain almost constant with the values varying in a small range of 1.78–1.84 V, despite the fact that the numbers and types of electron donors are varied to a large extent. This observation is in sharp contrast to the effective modulation of the HOMO–LUMO energy gaps by the modification of the π-conjugation systems.16a Due to the relatively constant HOMO–LUMO energy gaps for these porphyrin sensitizers, a higher HOMO energy level is associated with a higher LUMO energy level. Such a case is favorable for the electron injection process, but unfavorable for the dye regeneration process. On the other hand, a lower HOMO energy level associated with a lower LUMO energy level will be unfavorable for the electron injection process, but favorable for the dye regeneration process. Hence, the variation of the donor groups will have contradictory effects on the processes of electron injection and dye regeneration. Thus, it may be anticipated that for these porphyrin sensitizers with similar structures and comparable HOMO–LUMO gaps, a suitable combination of the donor moieties may result in moderate and matched HOMO and LUMO energy levels. In such a case, both the electron injection and the dye regeneration processes will be efficient, thus enabling an optimized cell performance. This agrees well with the cell performance measurements (vide infra).
DFT calculations
To gain further insight into the electronic properties of the porphyrins, DFT (density functional theory) calculations were performed. Geometry optimization was carried out at the B3LYP/6-31G* level.25Fig. 5 shows the corresponding molecular orbitals. The HOMO orbitals of the porphyrin dyes are delocalized over the donors and the porphyrin macrocycles while the LUMO orbitals are delocalized over the porphyrin macrocycles, the ethynylphenylene linkers and the carboxyl anchoring groups. Accordingly, the excitation of the electron from the HOMO to the LUMO orbital can result in the electron redistribution from the donor unit to the anchoring moiety, thus realizing electron injection to the conduction band of TiO2.

Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs
To check the possibility of utilizing these porphyrins as DSSC sensitizers, the porphyrins were loaded onto TiO2 nanoparticulate films to serve as working electrodes for the fabrication of DSSC devices. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements (Fig. 6) reflect the efficiency of photoelectric conversion at various wavelengths. Because of the strong absorption bands with high molar absorption coefficients, these porphyrin dyes have moderate to high IPCE values in a large wavelength range of 400–700 nm, indicative of the possibility to manufacture DSSCs with high efficiencies. The corresponding current–voltage curves are shown in Fig. 7, and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 3. The overall power conversion efficiencies (η) lie in the range of 2.70–5.45%, exhibiting an order of MT3P < MT2P < T3P < T2P < M3T2P, which has the same sequence as that for the IPCE curves. Thus, the cell based on the sensitization of M3T2P exhibits the highest IPCE curve, which corresponds to the highest Jsc. For M3T2P, a moderate electron donating trimethoxyphenyl group and two triphenylamine groups were introduced onto the meso-positions to afford moderate HOMO and LUMO energy levels among the porphyrin dyes (vide supra). The resulting HOMO level is more positive than those of MT2P and MT3P so that the dye regeneration efficiency for the DSSCs based on M3T2P may be higher than those for MT2P and MT3P. On the other hand, the LUMO level of M3T2P is more negative than those of T2P and T3P, so that the electron injection efficiency is higher compared with T2P and T3P. Hence, the DSSCs based on M3T2P exhibited the highest IPCE curve, showing the highest η value of 5.45%.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
To further clarify the interrelation between the dyes and the photoelectric properties of the DSSCs, electrochemical impedance spectral (EIS) analyses were performed in the dark. The EIS analysis provides information about interfacial charge transfer processes. Fig. 8a shows the typical Nyquist plots of both electrodes at an applied bias of −0.55 V. In the Nyquist plots, the high-frequency semicircle on the left indicates the Pt/redox (I−/I3−) interface charge transfer and the middle-frequency semicircle on the right corresponds to the electron transport process at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. The radii of the semicircles lie in the order of MT3P < MT2P < T3P < T2P < M3T2P, indicating the sequence of charge transfer resistance at the interface. In the Bode plots (Fig. 8b), the peaks at higher frequencies correspond to the charge transfer at the counter electrode, and the peaks at lower frequencies are related to the charge recombination rate, and its reciprocal is regarded as the electron lifetime.26 The peak maximum is shifted to lower frequency from MT3P to M3T2P in the same sequence as that observed for the IPCE curves. The electron lifetime values derived from the curve fitting for the cells based on MT3P, MT2P, T3P, T2P, and M3T2P are 23.9, 30.9, 40.4, 53.7, and 99.7 ms, respectively. Thus, M3T2P has the longest electron lifetime, indicative of a more effective suppression of the back reaction between the injected electrons and the electrolyte, resulting in the improvement of the Voc due to reduced charge recombination rate.27 The combination of the highest Voc and Jsc values (vide supra) affords the best photovoltaic performance of the solar cell based on M3T2P.

Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized novel porphyrin-based DSSC dyes with various numbers and types of donor groups attached at the meso-positions of porphyrins. The influences of the electron donors on spectral, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties of the porphyrin sensitizers were investigated. The tuning of HOMO–LUMO energy levels and the corresponding optical and electrochemical properties were effectively achieved by the variation of donor groups. Thus, the DSSC devices based on the M3T2P sensitizer have achieved a power conversion efficiency of 5.45%, with Jsc, Voc and ff values of 15.36 mA cm−2, 665 mV, and 0.53, respectively. Its best performance may be ascribed to a balance of efficient dye regeneration and electron injection processes resulting from the suitable arrangements of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, in combination with the longest electron lifetime. These results demonstrate that the introduction of appropriate electron donors might significantly enhance the photoelectrical performance of the DSSCs by modulating the HOMO and LUMO energy levels. It is noteworthy that the variation of the position and number of the methoxyl groups can be easily realized, and it is very effective for modulating the energy levels and DSSC efficiencies. Furthermore, other alkoxyl or phenoxyl substituents can be conveniently utilized instead of the methoxyl groups, which leaves space for further optimization of the dye structures and cell performance. The results are beneficial for further design of efficient DSSC sensitizers by the variation of the donor groups.
