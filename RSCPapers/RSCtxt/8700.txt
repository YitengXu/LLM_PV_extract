    , Accepted 11th May 2012First published on 13th June 2012AbstractHighly porous nanoparticle films were investigated as alternative working electrode morphology for the synthesis of dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). These films were rapidly assembled by flame synthesis and direct aerosol deposition of TiO2 nanoparticles with high specific surface area. Structural–functional analysis of their properties revealed that the film porosity is a key parameter greatly determining the resulting energy conversion efficiency (η). In fact, aerosol deposition at low substrate temperatures (∼100 °C) led to very high porosity (ε = 98%) and weak film cohesion. These films were easily resuspended upon immersion in the dye and/or electrolyte solutions resulting in very poor performances (η = 0.08%). In contrast, allowing for partial nanoparticle sintering by deposition at moderate temperatures (∼400 °C) decreased the film porosity from 98 to 95% leading to higher mechanical stability and partially preserving the large surface required for dye adsorption. As a result, these films had drastically higher current density (12.2 mA cm−2) and overall performances (η = 5%) representing an 8 times improvement with respect to the best reported for similar highly porous morphologies. Remarkably, their conversion efficiency decreased only slightly with increasing film thickness reaching 4.6% at 128 µm. This unique attribute suggests that high film porosity may inhibit recombination losses enabling utilization of thick films with enhanced light absorption properties.
1. Introduction
Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are a promising technology for renewable energy harvesting that offer some advantages over heterojunction-based devices.1,2 A key strength of DSSCs is the separation of electron generation and transport processes in two distinct materials.2 This allows utilization of an optimized dye for photon absorption and of a wide bandgap semiconductor for electron–hole separation and collection.1 The costs for the fabrication of such devices could reach a fraction of Si-based ones3 as the semiconductor film is usually made of inexpensive TiO2 nanoparticles that are already produced in large scale such as by flame synthesis.4 These unique features have triggered considerable academic and industrial interest in DSSC technology resulting in the rapid development of sophisticated dyes5,6 and semiconductor film morphologies.7 However, the maximum solar energy conversion efficiency (∼10.4%) of available DSSCs is still considerably below that of Si- (25%) or GaAs-based (26.1%) devices limiting their commercialization.8
Optimal engineering of the TiO2 film morphology is mandatory for assembly of efficient DSSCs.7 Best results have been achieved so far with inhomogeneous films made of transparent (d = 23 nm), scattering (d = 50 nm) and mixed (d = 23, 50 nm) TiO2 nanoparticle layers.7 Utilization of scattering nanoparticles was found to be a viable method to increase the optical film thickness7,9 and thus to compensate for the poor light absorption of most dyes in the red domain.5 In contrast, attempts to increase light absorption by merely increasing the film thickness resulted in lower conversion efficiencies as, above an optimal thickness, electron–hole recombination losses are dominant.7,10 For wet-made TiO2 nanoparticle films, an optimal thickness of 5–20 µm and porosity of 50–65% corresponding to a film mass density of 1–4 mg cm−2 have been reported.11 Such sophisticated films, however, seem to suffer from fundamental limitations as scattering particles offer less surface for dye adsorption and decrease incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) at lower wavelengths (<650 nm).7 In fact, further optimization of multi-layer film morphologies has not yet led to significant improvements of DSSC performances.8,12
To overcome these limitations several alternative morphologies (Table 1) have been proposed for the assembly of DSSC working electrodes including mesoporous,8,13 granular nanoparticle14 and nanowire films.15 The latter have demonstrated to considerably reduce recombination losses owing to better electron transport properties but resulted in small energy conversion efficiencies15 (1.5%) due to the small surface available for dye absorption.15 Mesoporous TiO2 films have demonstrated13,16 very high open circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factors (FFs) but relatively low current density and thus limited conversion efficiency (1.1–4.63%).16 This was attributed to the rapid leveling off of efficiency gains with increasing film thickness16 that may arise from the very small pore size and thus poor electrolyte ion exchange rates. In contrast, granular films made of transparent nanoparticles have very high porosity (≫65%) and offer high surface area for dye adsorption.14 These films have been successfully assembled by aerosol deposition of flame-made TiO2 nanoparticles and bear the potential to maximize light absorption by increasing drastically film roughness and thus dye loading.14,17 However, first attempts to utilize such porous nanoparticle films as DSSC working electrodes have led to efficiencies below 1%.14 Higher efficiencies were obtained only by sintering the nanoparticles into large columnar structures and thus drastically reducing porosity and surface area available for dye adsorption.18 These results are particularly surprising as high film porosities should enhance electrolyte ion exchange rates within the semiconductor film minimizing recombination losses and thus boosting conversion efficiencies.10 Considering that highly porous nanoparticle films suffer from low mechanical stability,19–21 optimization of their structural properties still bears the potential to improve considerably the resulting DSSC performance.

Among several methods for the synthesis of highly porous nanoparticle films, flame spray pyrolysis of nanoparticles and direct deposition of the resulting aerosol have demonstrated potential for the assembly of gas sensors,22,23 functional coatings24 and phosphor screens.25 The high production rate of spray flames results in highly concentrated aerosols granting short film assembly time19,24 and low production costs.4 Furthermore, deposition at low substrate temperatures (100–200 °C) leads to very high film porosities19,26 (98%) granting high accessibility of the nanoparticles surface.27 This enhances overall reaction rates resulting, for example, in highly sensitive metal-oxide gas sensors.27 However, increasing the mechanical stability of such films is mandatory for further handling.19 This is also very challenging as high substrate temperatures (≫200 °C) can lead to multi-crystalline, gas tight domains and drastic drops in film porosity as observed for SnO228 and TiO218 nanoparticles.
Here, highly porous nanoparticle films have been investigated as alternative morphology for the assembly of DSSCs. First, crystalline TiO2 nanoparticles with high specific surface area have been produced by flame synthesis. Films were self-assembled by direct aerosol deposition of these TiO2 nanoparticles on TCO substrates. The evolution of the film morphology was investigated as a function of the deposition conditions. Optimization of the films' mechanical stability was conducted to allow their utilization in liquid solutions while preserving high porosity and specific surface area for dye adsorption. Upon functionalization of the TiO2 surface with a standard dye (N719) and cell assembly, the DSSC performance was investigated with respect to key film structural properties such as phase composition, thickness and porosity. The feasibility of utilizing highly porous nanoparticle films as DSSC working electrodes was critically assessed focusing on the strengths of these morphologies and proposing new strategies to minimize their deficit in mechanical stability.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Film assembly, morphology and stability

Fig. 1 shows exemplary TEM images of TiO2 nanoparticles filter-collected from the flame-made aerosol at 50 cm height above the burner (HAB). The visible particle size (Fig. 1a) was considerably below 50 nm in agreement with their Sauter diameter (dBET = 15 nm). There was no evidence of the formation of larger particles (≥50 nm) that may act as light scattering centers. The composition of these nanoparticles was further investigated by FTIR analysis indicating the absence of carbon-related species. This confirms optimal combustion of the liquid precursor solution29 in line with previous reports24,30 on spray flame synthesis of TiO2 nanoparticles. At higher magnification (Fig. 1b), the particle size was polydisperse ranging from less than 5 nm to slightly above 20 nm. This is in agreement with the size distribution reported31 for flame-made SnO2 nanoparticles produced with similar conditions. Some broad sintering necks (Fig. 1b) were visible between large and very small particles. In contrast, large particles were mainly connected by open necks leading to the high specific surface area (SSA = 90 m2 g−1) of the as-prepared particles. As a result, these TiO2 nanoparticles were comparable to that previously utilized (d = 25 nm) for the synthesis of transparent nanoparticle layers7 offering even higher surface for dye adsorption.
 Fig. 1  TEM images of TiO2 nanoparticles made by liquid-fed spray flame synthesis and filter-collected from the hot aerosol. These nanoparticles were polydisperse (a) with size ranging (b) from 3 to 25 nm. 
This flame-made TiO2 aerosol was orthogonally impinged on cooled TCO substrates leading to the rapid (2–10 min) self-assembly of highly porous films as previously reported for SnO2,32 Eu:Y2O3 (ref. 25) and TiO2 (ref. 24 and 30) nanoparticles. The height above the burner (HAB) plays a major role in determining the properties of flame-made aerosols and thus on the resulting deposition dynamics and film morphology.33 Here, a minimal HAB of 10 cm was necessary to avoid damage of the TCO substrates due to too high thermal stress. The deposited films' mass density (md) increased linearly (Fig. 2) with increasing deposition time at all HAB indicating a constant nanoparticle deposition rate. Increasing the substrate HAB from 10 to 20 cm (Fig. 2) decreased the resulting film growth rate from 3.9 to 0.6 mg cm−2 min and the substrate surface temperature from ca. 400 to 100 °C. This is attributed to the high air entrainment of such open flames33,34 that drastically decreases aerosol concentration and temperature with increasing HAB. At 10 cm HAB (Fig. 2, triangles), aerosol deposition led to the rapid synthesis of very thick nanoparticle films with specific mass density (md) comparable to that (∼2 to 4 mg cm−2) utilized for the assembly of highly efficient DSSCs.11 These constant deposition rates are in agreement with the nanoparticle deposition mechanisms from hot flames that have been suggested recently.33

Increasing the HAB from 10 (triangles) to 20 cm (squares) decreased the film growth rate and substrate surface temperature from 3.9 to 0.6 mg cm−2 min and 400 to 100 °C, respectively. 
Aerosol deposition at 10 cm HAB resulted in TiO2 films with a relatively homogeneous surface (Fig. 3a) and internal structure (Fig. 3d) as previously observed for SnO2 nanoparticle deposition at 20 cm HAB.19 This excludes the direct deposition of liquid precursor droplets that would result in the formation of a rougher surface as reported for flame-assisted spray pyrolysis (FASP).35 At higher magnification (Fig. 3b), a very porous surface morphology was visible (Fig. 3c) that consisted of fine nanoparticles (≪100 nm) agglomerated in larger macrostructures. Analysis of the film cross-sections (Fig. 3d, inset) indicated a branch-like growth throughout the whole film thickness. This morphology (Fig. 3b–d) is considerably different from that previously reported19,24,26 for aerosol deposition of flame-made metal-oxide nanoparticles at 20 cm HAB. There the film surface was made of an intricate net of loose nanoparticle bridges extending over large surface pores that resulted in an average film porosity (ε, eqn (1)) of 98%.19,26 This is in line with the results, obtained here (not shown), for TiO2 deposition at 20 cm HAB that led also to 98% film porosity. In contrast, deposition at 10 cm HAB resulted in more compact macrostructures (Fig. 3b and c) with an average film porosity of 95% indicating considerable sintering of the nanoparticles during deposition. This film porosity (95%), however, is still extremely high with respect to that usually obtained by wet synthesis of DSSC TiO2 films (50–65%)11 and has considerable consequences on their thickness and morphology. For example, here, a TiO2 film with a mass density of 2.4 mg cm−2 (Fig. 3d) had a thickness (δ) of ca. 110 µm while standard wet-synthesis methods11 would have led to only 13–18.6 µm.
 Fig. 3  SEM images of an exemplary TiO2 nanoparticle film aerosol-deposited at 10 cm HAB. The film surface is homogeneous (a) and highly porous (b). The surface pore size is in the range of 2 µm similarly to that observed for deposition at 20 cm HAB. However, this morphology (b and c) is considerably more compact resulting in a porosity (ε) of 95% (d) against the 98% obtained by deposition at 20 cm HAB. Cross-sectional SEM images of the film (d, inset) suggest branch-like self-assembly of the TiO2 nanoparticles in a homogeneous and highly porous film structure. 
To assess the mechanical stability of these aerosol-deposited films (ε = 95–98%) for utilization as DSSC working electrodes, they were immersed in a liquid solution (similar to the dye one) and, upon drying, the residual film mass on the substrate was measured. Films having 98% porosity disintegrated completely during immersion in the liquid solution and ca. 0% residual film mass was measured independently of the film thickness. This is in good agreement with the poor mechanical stability of flame-made SnO2 nanoparticle films aerosol-deposited on Si-wafer at 20 cm HAB.19 In contrast, here, films having 95% porosity and 40 µm thickness had on average 80% residual film mass. This confirms that deposition at 10 cm HAB leads to more robust film morphologies. However, it also suggests that some restructuring of the film morphology still finds place upon immersion in the liquid solution and thus it is expected that further reduction of the porosity (<95%) is required to fully stabilize such loose nanoparticle films.
The stabilization dynamics of the TiO2 films deposited at 10 cm HAB was investigated further by analysis of their crystal composition as a function of the film thickness. The filter-collected TiO2 particles (Fig. 1) had 86 and 14 wt% anatase and rutile content (Fig. 4), respectively. This is in good agreement with the crystal structure reported for TiO2 nanoparticles flame-made with similar process conditions.30 The nanoparticle films deposited at 10 cm HAB had always smaller anatase contents (Fig. 4) than the filter-collected TiO2 particles. In particular, the film anatase content (Fig. 4) decreased from 81 to 57 wt% with increasing film thickness from 44 to 206 µm. This is attributed to the relatively high temperature (∼400 °C) of the substrate surface during deposition at 10 cm HAB that facilitated the transformation from anatase to the thermodynamic more favorable rutile phase. In contrast, the anatase content of the films deposited at 20 cm HAB (not shown) was identical to that of the filter-collected nanoparticles (Fig. 4) as the substrate temperature (∼100 °C) was too low to induce measurable phase transformation in the short (≤10 min) deposition times utilized.
 Fig. 4  XRD patterns of the filter-collected TiO2 powders and aerosol deposited TiO2 films at 10 cm HAB as a function of the film thickness (δ). The as-prepared flame-made TiO2 nanoparticles were constituted by 86 wt% anatase (triangles), the most favorable phase for DSSCs, and by 14 wt% rutile (circles). The anatase content decreased with increasing film thickness due to the relatively high (∼400 °C) substrate surface temperature during deposition. 
This phase transformation from anatase to rutile played a major role in the resulting film morphology and stability. The anatase (Fig. 5, triangles) and rutile (circles) crystal sizes of the filter-collected TiO2 powder were 18 and 8 nm, respectively. For the films, the anatase (Fig. 5, triangles) crystal size increased only moderately from 23 to 27 nm with their thickness increasing from 44 to 206 µm while the rutile crystal size (Fig. 5, circles) increased drastically from 14 to 42 nm. This suggests that during nanoparticle deposition the film undergoes two restructuring stages. The first stage up to 44 µm thickness, where surface diffusion was the main force driving particle sintering. This led rapidly to the achievement of a nearly stable anatase crystal size of 23 nm (Fig. 5, triangles) and is in line with the small variation in crystal composition (Fig. 4). During the second stage, the phase transformation from anatase to rutile was predominant and alimented the drastic growth of the rutile crystal size (Fig. 5, circles). This phase transformation is particularly a negative side effect of the higher substrate temperatures necessary to stabilize such loose nanoparticle films. In fact, it reduced the amount of the best DSSC-performing anatase phase36 and increased the rutile crystal size (Fig. 5, circles) possibly increasing back scattering of incident photons. Furthermore, while the initial sintering stage (Fig. 5) increased considerably the film mechanical stability (80% residual mass) with respect to that (0% residual mass) of the TiO2 films deposited at 20 cm HAB, the second stage did not lead to further improvements. As a result, further studies on aerosol deposition of flame-made TiO2 nanoparticles for assembly of DSSC working electrodes should focus also on the inhibition of the anatase–rutile phase transformation.

The restructuring of the film composition during deposition is characterized by two stages. The first stage up to ca. 44 µm thickness controlled by grain boundary sintering, where the anatase crystal size (triangles) nearly reaches an asymptotic value of 23 nm. A second (δ > 44 µm) controlled by the anatase–rutile phase transformation where the rutile crystal size (circles) drastically increases above that of anatase (triangles). 
2.2 DSSC performance
The N719 dye saturation adsorption capacity (8.5 × 10−7 mol m−2) of these as-prepared TiO2 particles was comparable to that reported (6.9 × 10−7 mol m−2) for small (dBET = 15 nm) wet-made nanoparticles with other Ru-based dyes.37 Upon sensitization with N719, the TiO2 films were sealed to Pt-coated counter electrodes and filled with a liquid electrolyte. The performance (Fig. 6) of these cells (at AM 1.5, 1000 W m−2) was strongly dependent on the TiO2 film morphology. Deposition at 20 cm HAB led to solar energy conversion efficiencies (eqn (2)) always below 0.1%. Fig. 6 shows the I–V plot of a TiO2 film deposited for 10 min at 20 cm HAB (broken line). This cell had a short-circuit current density (JSC) and an open circuit voltage (VOC) of only 0.41 mA cm−2 and 0.42 V, respectively, resulting in a conversion efficiency of 0.08%. This poor performance is in good agreement with the low conversion efficiencies (≤0.6%) previously reported14,17 for granular (flame-made) TiO2 nanoparticle films (Table 1) and was attributed to their low mechanical stability. More in detail, the VOC (0.42 V) of these films was very low in comparison to that usually obtained (∼0.7 V) which corresponds to the difference between the (quasi)Fermi level of TiO2 and the redox potential of the electrolyte.11 This suggests the formation of cracks throughout the TiO2 film that result in the direct contact of the oxidised electrolyte with the TCO surface and thus low VOC.
 Fig. 6  
I–V plots of DSSCs made of TiO2 nanoparticle films deposited at 10 (continuous line) and 20 cm (broken line) HAB. The film deposited at 20 cm HAB had very poor performance in line with the low mechanical stability observed at 98% porosity. In contrast, the film deposited at 10 cm HAB reached high VOC and relatively high JSC resulting in an efficiency of 5%. 
Aerosol deposition at 10 cm HAB led to significant enhancement of the solar energy conversion efficiencies in line with the higher mechanical stability of these films. Fig. 6 shows the I–V plots of an exemplary TiO2 film (ε = 95%) with a thickness of 38 µm under artificial sun light illumination. This film reached a VOC and JSC of 0.68 V and 12.2 mA cm−2, respectively, resulting in a conversion efficiency of 5.03%. This is an 8 times enhancement with respect to the maximum efficiency previously reported14,18 for granular TiO2 nanoparticle films (Table 1) aerosol-deposited upon flame synthesis. The VOC (0.68 V) obtained here indicates that sufficient stabilization of the TiO2 film was reached to exploit nearly the full potential of the utilized electrolyte–semiconductor couple. However, further improvements of the film phase composition (higher anatase content) are necessary to achieve (Table 1) the very high VOC (0.78–0.799 V)13,16,17 reported for granular and mesoporous TiO2 films. The fill factor (eqn (3)) of these TiO2 films deposited at HAB = 10 cm (Table 1) was (0.59) considerably higher than that (0.43) reported for granular films but still lower than the best reported (0.72) for mesoporous ones. This FF (0.59) is also smaller than that (∼0.7) commonly achieved11 by TiO2-based DSSCs. This is attributed to the only partial stability (80% residual mass) of the TiO2 films deposited at 10 cm HAB that led to some reorganization of the films morphology upon immersion in the dye solution. This suggests that although considerable stabilization was obtained higher conversion efficiencies can be achieved by further optimization of the film morphology.
The JSC of these (10 cm HAB) films (12.2 mA cm−2) was remarkably higher (Table 1) than that reported for other alternative (Table 1) working electrode morphologies. In particular, mesoporous TiO2 films (Table 1) reached a maximum JSC of 7 mA cm−2 and randomly oriented TiO2 nanoparticle produced only 4.5 mA cm−2.13 Recently, films made of standard P25 nanoparticles (Table 1), sensitized with the same dye (N719), resulted in a JSC of 5.04 mA cm−2 and a conversion efficiency of 2.7%.38 Here, the high JSC obtained (12.2 mA cm−2) is comparable to that (14.5 mA cm−2) achieved12 by more sophisticated multi-layer (transparent/scattering) film morphologies. This demonstrates that highly porous nanoparticle films, such as those produced here, are able to achieve considerable light absorption even without utilization of light scattering nanoparticles. This is attributed to the very high surface area (Fig. 3) of these transparent nanoparticle films that results in high dye loading and thus electron–hole generation. As a result, the low JSC (2.54 mA cm−2) previously reported17 (Table 1) for porous granular nanoparticle films as well as their low FF cannot be attributed to their high porosity and may result from insufficient mechanical stabilization. Reference cells made by wet-deposition of the same flame-made TiO2 nanoparticles led to less homogeneous morphologies characterized by deep cracks and with a thickness of 35 ± 10 mm. Their efficiency varied from 3.6 to 5.7%. This indicates that aerosol deposition leads, even for much thicker films (>100 mm) and relatively fragile morphologies, already to performance comparable to standard wet-deposition methods.39 However, it should be stressed out that the overall performance of these films is not yet very high as standard multi-layer DSSCs have already reached certified efficiencies of ca. 11%40 and thus further optimization is necessary to reach competitive performances.
The performance of the TiO2 films aerosol-deposited at 10 cm HAB was further investigated (Fig. 7) as a function of their thickness. Their conversion efficiency (Fig. 7a, triangles) increased from 4.5 to 5% with increasing thickness from 21 to 38 µm mainly due to an increase in JSC (Fig. 7a, circles) from 11.8 to 12.2 mA cm−2. This is in line with the higher surface available for dye adsorption with increasing film thickness. Simultaneously, the FF (Fig. 7b, diamonds) of these films increased from 0.52 to 0.59 suggesting an improvement of their morphology. This is in agreement with the observed (Fig. 5) initial mechanical stabilization of the TiO2 films during the first stage of growth and with the relatively high anatase content (Fig. 4) preserved up to a film thickness of 44 µm. However, these positive effects were countered by a drop in the VOC (Fig. 7b, squares) from 0.71 to 0.68 V suggesting a localized rutile increase at the TiO2 film–TCO interface.
 Fig. 7  (a) Efficiency (triangles) and JSC (circles) of TiO2 nanoparticle films deposited at 10 cm HAB as a function of their thickness (δ) under 1 sun illumination (1.5 AM, 1000 W m−2). A maximum efficiency (triangles) was found at 44 µm thickness in agreement with the highest JSC (circles). (b) The VOC (squares) decreased with increasing thickness while the fill factor (FF, diamonds) was nearly constant. 
Increasing further the TiO2 film thickness from 38 to 128 µm (Fig. 7a, triangles) decreased the conversion efficiency to 4.6% mainly due to a 7.3% drop in JSC (Fig. 7a, circles). This was attributed to the rapidly increasing rutile content (Fig. 4) and crystal size (Fig. 5, circles) measured with increasing film thickness in the second stage of film stabilization. In fact, these sintered multi-crystalline rutile structures may act as light scattering centers9 decreasing light absorption and thus electron generation as observed12 in films made of a single layer of large scattering TiO2 nanoparticles. Nevertheless, these results show, for the first time, that highly porous films of nanoparticles (95%) can sustain nearly initial efficiencies at least up to a thickness of 128 µm. This is quite remarkable as usually the conversion efficiency of TiO2 working electrodes with standard porosity (ε = 50–65%) decreases rapidly already above a film thickness of ca. 5–20 µm.11 The JSC of mixed nanoparticle films (23, 50 nm), for example, decreased by ca. 14% with increasing film thickness from 17 to 31 µm.7 This is commonly attributed to lower electrolyte ion exchange rates in thick films that result in slower neutralization of photogenerated holes in the working electrode and thus to higher recombination losses.7,10 Here, the stability of the conversion efficiency and JSC up to 128 µm film thickness suggests that highly porous film morphologies may inhibit recombination losses by enhancing electrolyte ion exchange rates. As a result, highly porous films of transparent TiO2 nanoparticles bear the potential to provide considerable enhancements of the solar energy conversion efficiency of state-of-the-art DSSCs. However, the limited number of necking points in highly porous films could also inhibit electron transport as observed for porous films (ε ≈ 74%) of inverse anatase opals39 and thus further investigation of the properties of such morphologies is required.
3. Conclusions
Highly porous films of transparent TiO2 nanoparticles were investigated as alternative morphology for assembly of DSSC working electrodes. First insights into the structural–functional relationships of these films were presented highlighting strengths and deficits of these loose morphologies. Highly porous films were rapidly (2–10 min) self-assembled by direct aerosol deposition of flame-made nanoparticles. Enhancement of the film mechanical stability was achieved by reduction of their porosity from 98 to 95% allowing their utilization in liquid environments. The film stabilization dynamics was further investigated suggesting two restructuring stages of the film morphology. The first stage controlled by grain boundaries sintering and the second stage driven by a rapid phase transformation from anatase to rutile. Mechanical stabilization occurred mainly during the first stage while during the second stage the amount of the most favorable anatase phase was drastically reduced and the rutile crystal size was remarkably increased.
Nanoparticle films having 95% porosity had drastically higher solar energy conversion efficiency (η = 5%) than those with 98% (η = 0.08%) and achieved an 8 times improvement with respect to the best performance (η = 0.6%) previously reported for porous, granular films of flame-made TiO2 nanoparticles. This was attributed to the remarkable JSC (12.2 mA cm−2) obtained by these highly porous films that was significantly higher than those reported (≤7 mA cm−2) for some other novel working electrode morphologies. Relatively high conversion efficiencies (4.6%) were preserved up to a film thickness of 128 µm suggesting that recombination losses may be inhibited in such morphologies. These results suggest that highly porous films are a promising alternative design for the synthesis of advanced DSSCs. Further optimization of their mechanical stability and phase composition is expected to lead to considerable improvements in solar energy conversion efficiencies. Furthermore, TiO2 film fabrication by direct aerosol deposition of flame-made nanoparticles has shown to be a rapid (min) synthesis route that combines the strengths of a scalable nanoparticle source with the benefit of a single-step film assembly process.
4. Experimental
4.1 Nanoparticle film synthesis and characterization
Titanium oxide24,30 nanoparticle aerosols were synthesized by flame spray pyrolysis as previously described in detail.41 The TiO2 precursor solution was prepared as follows: titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TTIP, Aldrich, purity > 97%) was diluted in xylene (Fluka, purity > 98.5%) and toluene (Sigma-Aldrich, purity > 99.7%), respectively, with a total metal (Ti) atom concentration of 0.5 mol l−1. This solution was supplied at a rate of 5 ml min−1 through the LSF nozzle and dispersed to a fine spray with 5 l min−1 oxygen (pressure drop 1.5 bar). This spray was ignited by a supporting ring-shaped premixed methane–oxygen flame (CH4 = 1.2 l min−1, O2 = 3.2 l min−1). Additional 5 l min−1 sheath oxygen were supplied from an annulus surrounding the spray flame to assure excess oxidant flow. The TiO2 nanoparticles were collected on water cooled glass-fiber filters placed at 50 cm height above the burner (HAB) and characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with a Hitachi H600 microscope, operated at 100 kV.
Nanoparticle films were aerosol-deposited on soda lime glass substrates coated on one side with a F-doped SnO2 (FTO) layer (TCO22-15, Solaronix AG) of 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm that were placed on a water cooled holder at a constant (10–20 cm) HAB. This resulted in a high nanoparticle flux toward the substrate surface and rapid growth of a very porous film. Prior to DSSC assembly, the TiO2 films deposited at 20 cm HAB were further stabilized during 30 s by a previously reported in situ annealing step.19 During deposition, the substrate holder and surface temperatures were measured by an n-type thermocouple and IR-sensor, respectively.
The film specific mass (md) and bulk thickness (BT) were computed by gravimetric measurement of the deposited film mass on the F-SnO2 or on Ti substrates over the coated substrate surface and from the content-weighted density of TiO2 anatase and rutile. The film visible thickness (δ) and morphology were characterized by SEM analysis with a LEO 1530 Gemini (Zeiss/LEO, Oberkochen) and a Tecnai F30 microscope (FEI (Eindhoven); field emission cathode, operated at 300 kV). The average film porosity (ε) was computed as follows:19,26 (1)
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the films and filter-collected nanoparticles were obtained by a Bruker, AXS D8 Advance diffractometer operated at 40 kV, 40 mA at 2θ (Cu Kα) = 15–75°, step = 0.03° and scan speed = 0.6° min−1. The crystal size (dXRD) was determined using the Rietveld fundamental parameter method with the structural parameters of TiO2 anatase42 and rutile.43 The nanoparticle specific surface area (SSA) was measured by BET analysis using a Micromeritics Tristar 3000. The BET equivalent diameter (dBET) was calculated using the density of TiO2 anatase (3.84 g cm−3) and rutile (4.26 g cm−3) for the given XRD composition. The films' mechanical stability was characterized by immersion in an ethanol bath for 10 s and measurement of the mass loss due to film disintegration and re-suspension of the nanoparticles. The FTIR analysis was performed with a Bruker, Vector 22 operated with a resolution of 2 cm−1 between 4500 and 500 cm−1 and averaging 128 scan. Previous to each measurement the in situ heating cell (Harrick) was kept at 400 °C for 2 h while flushed with 25 ml min−1 synthetic air (Pan Gas 5.0). The (dye) saturation adsorption capacity of these flame-made TiO2 nanoparticles was computed by measuring the optical thickness of a 1.5 × 10−4 mol l−1 N719 dye–ethanol solution at λ = 534 nm (extinction coefficient, ε = 1.47 × 104 l mol−1 cm)44 before and after (1 h) impregnation of the TiO2 nanoparticles.
4.2 DSSC assembly and characterization
Before assembly of the solar cells, the TiO2 films were first heated up to 450 °C in order to remove adsorbed H2O and impurities. This short heating step did not change the crystal properties of the TiO2 films in line with previous sintering studies45 of such flame-made TiO2 nanoparticles. Upon cooling to 60 °C, they were sensitized by 1 h immersion in a solution containing Ruthenizer 535-bis TBA (N719 dye, Solaronix AG) with a concentration of 2 × 10−3 mol l−1 in ethanol (Fluka, purity > 99.8%). After sensitization, the solution residuals were washed away by immersion in an ethanol bath for 10 s. The counter electrodes were prepared by doctor-blading of a commercially available Pt-paste (Plastisol T/SP, Solaronix) on the FTO substrates (TCO22-15, Solaronix AG). The working and counter electrodes were sealed together by thermal application of a commercially available foil (Meltonix 1170-100, Solaronix AG) on the working electrode margins leading to a working electrode area of 6 mm × 6 mm. The electrolyte was prepared by addition of 0.6 M tert-butyl ammonium iodide (Aldrich), 0.1 M LiI (Aldrich, purity > 98%), 0.1 M I2 (Aldrich, purity > 98%), 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine (Aldrich, purity > 98%) to acetonitrile (Aldrich, purity > 99%).46 The electrolyte was let into the cell by a small (0.5 mm in diameter) opening previously drilled in the counter electrode. Thereafter this opening was closed by application of a sealing foil and a thin borosilicate glass sheet (1.5 mm) (613-0121, VWR international) on the backside of the counter electrode. To improve the conductivity, the external surface of the FTO substrates was coated with a colloidal silver paste (#05063-AB, SPI supplies) and air dried for 30 min.
The DSSC performance was evaluated along the film porosity and thickness. Current–voltage (I–V) plots were obtained both in the dark and under one sun illumination (AM 1.5, Psource = 1000 W m−2) as supplied by a solar simulator (Solarsim 150, Solaronix AG) calibrated with a standard reference cell (ESTI Sensor, ES 1034, European Solar Test Installation) before each measurement session. The cells solar energy conversion efficiency (η) was computed by:11,47,48 (2)where JSC is the short-circuit current density, VOC is the open circuit voltage and FF is the fill factor. The fill factor was computed by: (3)where Vmax and Jmax are the voltage and current density, respectively, at maximum power output density (Pmax).

 	Fig. 1  TEM images of TiO2 nanoparticles made by liquid-fed spray flame synthesis and filter-collected from the hot aerosol. These nanoparticles were polydisperse (a) with size ranging (b) from 3 to 25 nm.	 

 	Fig. 2  Deposited TiO2 film mass density (md) as a function of the aerosol-deposition time (td) at several heights above the burner (HAB). Increasing the HAB from 10 (triangles) to 20 cm (squares) decreased the film growth rate and substrate surface temperature from 3.9 to 0.6 mg cm−2 min and 400 to 100 °C, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 3  SEM images of an exemplary TiO2 nanoparticle film aerosol-deposited at 10 cm HAB. The film surface is homogeneous (a) and highly porous (b). The surface pore size is in the range of 2 µm similarly to that observed for deposition at 20 cm HAB. However, this morphology (b and c) is considerably more compact resulting in a porosity (ε) of 95% (d) against the 98% obtained by deposition at 20 cm HAB. Cross-sectional SEM images of the film (d, inset) suggest branch-like self-assembly of the TiO2 nanoparticles in a homogeneous and highly porous film structure.	 

 	Fig. 4  XRD patterns of the filter-collected TiO2 powders and aerosol deposited TiO2 films at 10 cm HAB as a function of the film thickness (δ). The as-prepared flame-made TiO2 nanoparticles were constituted by 86 wt% anatase (triangles), the most favorable phase for DSSCs, and by 14 wt% rutile (circles). The anatase content decreased with increasing film thickness due to the relatively high (∼400 °C) substrate surface temperature during deposition.	 

 	Fig. 5  Anatase (triangles) and rutile (circles) crystal size of the filter-collected TiO2 nanoparticles and of the aerosol-deposited films at 10 cm HAB as a function of their thickness (δ). The restructuring of the film composition during deposition is characterized by two stages. The first stage up to ca. 44 µm thickness controlled by grain boundary sintering, where the anatase crystal size (triangles) nearly reaches an asymptotic value of 23 nm. A second (δ > 44 µm) controlled by the anatase–rutile phase transformation where the rutile crystal size (circles) drastically increases above that of anatase (triangles).	 

 	Fig. 6  
I–V plots of DSSCs made of TiO2 nanoparticle films deposited at 10 (continuous line) and 20 cm (broken line) HAB. The film deposited at 20 cm HAB had very poor performance in line with the low mechanical stability observed at 98% porosity. In contrast, the film deposited at 10 cm HAB reached high VOC and relatively high JSC resulting in an efficiency of 5%.	 

 	Fig. 7  (a) Efficiency (triangles) and JSC (circles) of TiO2 nanoparticle films deposited at 10 cm HAB as a function of their thickness (δ) under 1 sun illumination (1.5 AM, 1000 W m−2). A maximum efficiency (triangles) was found at 44 µm thickness in agreement with the highest JSC (circles). (b) The VOC (squares) decreased with increasing thickness while the fill factor (FF, diamonds) was nearly constant.
