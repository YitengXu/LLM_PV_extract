    , Accepted 7th February 2019First published on 8th February 2019AbstractThe environmentally benign production of clean energy is extremely important for the sustainable progress of our society. In this respect, dihydrogen (H2) has been considered in the last decades as an efficient energy carrier and much effort has been directed to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we report on the efficiency of iron-based 5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrins containing carboxylate groups in different positions (ortho, meta and para of the meso-substituted aryl groups of the porphyrin backbone) as molecular catalysts for the HER. The iron-based porphyrin containing the carboxylic acids in the ortho position was found completely inactive in the HER. Furthermore, besides stereoelectronic control, the subtle differences observed in the cyclic voltammograms (CV) as well as those associated with the electrocatalytic activity might involve a previously neglected ion-pair interaction between the carboxylate groups of the porphyrin scaffold and the chloride anions belonging to the proton source, which highlights the relevance of ion-pair contacts remote from the active center for this type of catalytic system.
1. Introduction
The development of sustainable technologies for energy conversion is extremely important in the actual frame of global air pollution and climate change. Particular focus is currently given to solar-to-hydrogen (H2) conversion, which seems very promising to decrease the ecological footprint of energy grids.1 In this approach, sunlight is absorbed by a semiconductor junction and readily converted into a current that is applied to an electrolyte for water electrolysis.2 During the latter step, the chemical bonds of water are split generating H2, an energy-dense fuel that can be readily stored and used to provide sustainable energy on site and on demand.3 To be efficient, solar-to-H2 conversion devices should be able to produce high photoelectrocatalytic current with low power input. The performance of these systems relies on electrocatalysts, which are essential components to decrease the energy barrier as well as increase the kinetics of water electrolysis half-reactions (hydrogen evolution reaction –HER– and oxygen evolution reaction –OER–).4 Because the best electrocatalysts known so far for the HER are traditionally derived from scarce and expensive materials (Pt, Pd, Rh), a considerable amount of research effort currently goes into the fundamental understanding of the HER and the development of more efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts.5 In this context, well-defined organometallic molecules based on abundant metals are unique models for the study of the HER. Indeed, they can be precisely tailored in order to change the local environment of the active metal centre and, as such, it enables control of the catalytic activity.6 Several HER-active organometallic compounds based on abundant metals have been reported.7 Among them, Co,8 Fe,9 Ni10 and Sb11 porphyrins are particularly appealing (Fig. 1) because of (1) their rigid, planar and stable geometry, (2) the ease of synthetic modification6b as well as (3) their potential for electrode integration.12 The multiple benefits that arise from the unique structure of the porphyrin ring towards the HER have been highlighted by several groups. For instance, Cao et al. have described the positive influence of electron withdrawing groups (–C6F5) attached to the nickel- and gallium-porphyrin ring, respectively (A, Fig. 1).13 Zhang et al. have shown that a β-hydrogenated porphyrin ring increases the electron density on the metal centre, thus increasing the reactivity as well (B, Fig. 1).14 Nocera et al. have demonstrated the possibility of introducing a “hangman” covalently-linked acid functionality on the second coordination sphere to act as a proton relay at the proximity of the metal center (C, Fig. 1).15 So far, the study of electrocatalytic iron porphyrins bearing multiple proton relays and local proton sources have been limited to the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)16 and CO2 reduction.17 In this contribution, we report a systematic study of iron porphyrins bearing carboxyl functionalities (as acids and as esters at different positions) that behave as molecular catalysts for the HER (2–4 and 2′–4′, Fig. 1). The acid-containing catalysts were found to be generally more efficient than their corresponding esters in terms of activity. Such observations for the HER might involve a previously neglected, ion-pair network between the catalyst and the proton source.

2. Results and discussion
The iron-containing porphyrins 1–4 and 2′–4′ were prepared according to slight modifications of literature procedures (see the Experimental section and ESI†). Next, we studied the cathodic behavior of all the iron porphyrins (Fig. 2a and b). Iron porphyrin 1 was chosen as the reference since its electrochemistry and HER activity are well documented.9 Except for 4, the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of all the iron porphyrins in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as solvent show an electrochemical response comparable to 1, that is, with two quasi-reversible redox waves at E > −1.30 V vs. KCl-saturated calomel electrode (SCE) which are attributed to the redox couples FeIII(porphyrin)+/FeII(porphyrin) (E (FeIII/FeII)0′ = −0.25 ± 0.04 V for 2–4 and −0.12 ± 0.03 V for 2′–4′) and FeII(porphyrin)/FeI(porphyrin)− (E (FeII/FeI)0′ = −1.02 ± 0.05 V), respectively. At more negative potentials (E < −1.30 V), another cathodic wave, which is less reversible than the first two, was observed for 2 and the three ester derivatives 2′–4′. This wave is attributed to the reduction of FeI(porphyrin)− to Fe0(porphyrin)2−, that is, the catalytically active species for the HER9 and CO2 reduction.12b A peculiar behavior was observed for ortho-substituted tetraacid 4, which displayed only one clear quasi-reversible wave (FeIII/FeII) at −1.46 V (vide infra), the two subsequent cathodic waves (FeII/FeI and FeI/Fe0) being clearly much less reversible (the scan rate dependency on the reversibility for this compound is described below).
 Fig. 2  CVs obtained for the iron porphyrins containing carboxylic acids 2–4 (a) and methyl esters 2′–4′ (b). The CV of benchmark compound 1 is represented by a black thin line (a). 
Next, all iron porphyrins were tested for the HER with Et3NHCl serving as the proton source (Fig. S2 shows the HER activity for 1, see the ESI†). As shown in Fig. 3a–f, the third redox wave was affected by the presence of the acid for all the iron porphyrins except for 4. In these cases, Et3NHCl induced an increase in the reduction current as well as a loss of reversibility for the methyl ester derivatives 2′–4′. The reduction wave was exclusively dependent on the acid concentration in the 1 to 15 mM concentration range. These effects are indicative of electrochemical catalysis, and demonstrate that compounds 2–3 and 2′–4′ are catalytically active for the HER (vide infra). The HER-active compounds triggered the catalysis with onset potentials between −1.28 V and −1.43 V; and maximum current densities in the order of 1 mA cm−2, the highest being measured for the carboxylic acids 2 and 3 (Fig. 4a and b). It is worthy to mention that in terms of onset potential, the best catalyst was 2′, which is in good agreement with the fact that it exhibited the least negative FeI(porphyrin)− reduction wave (Fig. 2b). The ortho derivatives (4 and 4′) showed a notably different behavior for the HER with respect to all other iron porphyrins (Fig. 3a–f). While 4′ exhibited the lowest onset potential (<−1.4 V, Fig. 4b), the CVs measured for 4 did not change significantly upon addition of Et3NHCl (Fig. 3c), revealing its total inactivity towards the HER. In contrast with the meta- and the para-substituted iron porphyrins, the ortho-ones might lead to an important constrained geometry which could result in weaker electronic stabilization of the reduced states of the catalyst and thus more cathodic redox waves. This is clearly revealed by the CV of 4′, which shows the three redox waves at slightly more negative potentials compared to the other ester derivatives 2′ and 3′ (Fig. 2b). This effect explains the low reduction potential of FeI(porphyrin)− to Fe0(porphyrin)2− as well as the low catalytic HER onset potential for 4′ (Fig. 3f and 4b). In contrast, the atypical behavior of 4 regarding its CV and its inactivity towards HER must be different and was further assessed.

The two most negative reduction waves for 4 were examined as a function of the potential scan rate v in the absence of a proton source. The FeII(porphyrin)/FeI(porphyrin)− wave was electrochemically reversible (Fig. S7–S10 in the ESI†) with an apparent electron-transfer standard rate constant ks of ca. 0.06 cm s−1 (Table S2 in the ESI†). The most negative wave, assigned to the FeI(porphyrin)−/Fe0(porphyrin)2− couple exhibited a one-electron irreversible cathodic peak at low scan rates. At high scan rates (>10 V s−1), a partial reversibility appears for this system (Fig. S8 in the ESI†) and a value of ks identical to that calculated for FeII(porphyrin)/FeI(porphyrin)− was determined from the peak-to-peak separation. To sum-up, the electrochemical data obtained for FeI(porphyrin)−/Fe0(porphyrin)2− in 4 is consistent with an EC mechanism consisting of an reversible electrochemical step (E) followed by an irreversible chemical step (C).18 The irreversible chemical step in 4 could be attributed to the interference of chloride ions between the iron-hydride active species and the carboxylic acid group, as supported by molecular modelling (Fig. S18 in the ESI†) or by the formation of a Fe-oxo bridge, both explaining the unconventional CV shape as well as the inhibition of the HER.
Although it is difficult to exclude any proton relay in the iron-porphyrins 2–4 at this stage, it seems unlikely because (i) the carboxylic acid functionalities in 2 and 3 are located rather far apart from the iron center when compared to the designs by Nocera1a,2d,10,15,19 and DuBois6a,7b and (ii) iron-porphyrin 4 which is the one that contains the carboxylic acid functionalities closest to the iron center is completely inactive in the HER (Fig. 3c). It is important to note that the differences observed in the HER between the ester-containing iron-porphyrins 2′, 3′ and 4′ might be a consequence of the different electronic properties of the porphyrin ligand coordinated to the iron center in each case.
To evaluate the efficiency of the iron catalysts towards the HER, pseudo-first-order rate constants (kobs) were calculated as a function of the concentration of Et3NHCl using the following relation:  where ic is the catalytic peak current, ip is the non-catalytic peak current, R is the ideal gas constant, T is equal to 298.15 K, F is Faraday's constant, and ν is the scan rate (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 5  a) Evolution of kobs for the iron porphyrins as a function of the concentration of Et3NHCl. b) Faradaic efficiency of each iron porphyrin in the presence of 15 mM Et3NHCl. 
This model has been previously applied to measure catalytic rates of first-order electrocatalytic reactions and the HER; although the final mechanism might be more complicated.7e,14 In addition, we performed a series of preparative-scale electrolysis in a Hoffman cell, which allowed the measurement of the quantity of produced H2 and the determination of the faradaic efficiencies (η) for each iron porphyrin, which, except for 4, all ranged from 79 to 100% (Fig. 5b). Besides 4 and 4′ that have a peculiar behavior (vide supra), the value of kobs (at a proton source concentration of 15 mM) was significantly higher with the acid-containing porphyrins 2 (88 s−1) and 3 (158 s−1) than with their corresponding esters 2′ (61 s−1) and 3′ (27 s−1), highlighting the importance of a remotely located acid group for the HER (Fig. 5a). Interestingly, the presence of a proton source in the solution did not influence the position of the two first redox waves for the ester derivatives 2′ and 3′ (see details in Fig. S3†), whereas it induced anodic shifts for all redox waves of acid-containing 2 and 3 (see details in Fig. S4†). This behavior is quite unexpected as cathodic shifts are typically expected to occur in the presence of chloride.20 The same behavior was observed when using other protons sources such as NH4Cl and Me3NHCl (see details in Fig. S5†) but was much less pronounced with NH4PF6 (see Fig. S6†). Since these two redox waves are Fe-centered one-electron reductions that do not involve proton transfer, the shifts are not caused by the presence of H+ but rather reveal the non-innocence of the proton source and its interaction with the iron porphyrin.
To address such a hypothesis, UV-vis studies were performed by adding incremental amounts of the proton source (Et3NHCl) to solutions of iron porphyrins at a constant concentration (Fig. S11–S17 in the ESI†). For all cases, significant changes were observed as compared to the background spectrum and isosbestic points were found (Fig. 6a and ESI†). However, quantification of each binding event was not possible due to the multiple possibilities that can arise. Although qualitatively, these findings indicate a host–guest interaction between the proton source (guest) and the iron porphyrin (host) even in the presence of a strongly coordinating polar solvent, i.e. DMF. To better understand such an interaction, preliminary PM3-minimized calculations were carried out with the hydride derivative of an iron porphyrin containing one carboxylic acid in the meta position (3*), which is a simplified model of the resting state of 3, that is the catalyst that displays the most interesting features towards the HER. In the presence of a model of ammonium chloride (Me3NHCl) as the proton source, a supramolecular structure was found to be energetically stable where the chloride anion is hydrogen bonding with the carboxylic group of 3* whereas the iron-hydride lies at close proximity to the ammonium cation (Fig. 6b and S19 in the ESI†). Consequently, it seems reasonable to consider that carboxylic acids, even if they are remote from the active site, interact with chloride ions to some extent, thus leaving the iron centre more reactive towards the HER.

This hypothesis was further stressed by electrochemical experiments where the Cl− anions were swapped with PF6− anions. In Fig. 7 we compare the electrocatalytic activity obtained for 3 in the presence of the same concentration of different proton sources, namely, Et3NHCl, NH4Cl and NH4PF6. First, one can observe that a higher catalytic current was obtained for Et3NHCl, which can be understood by the lower pKa of Et3NH+ with respect to NH4+ in DMF.21 Of particular interest, the comparison of the voltammograms obtained with NH4Cl and NH4PF6 show that the replacement of Cl− by a bulky anion (PF6−) results in HER inhibition, highlighting again the importance of the chloride anion for promoting the HER with carboxylate-containing tetraphenylporphyrins.

3. Conclusions
In summary, we have shown that iron-based porphyrins bearing carboxylic groups are suitable molecular electrocatalysts for HER when the substituents are located sufficiently far away from the Fe centre, as is the case for 2 and 3. A combination of complementary studies including CV, kinetics, bulk electrolysis, UV-vis spectroscopy and preliminary molecular modelling together suggested a unique ion-pair interaction between the molecular catalyst and the proton source as a key feature for these systems. Such interactions, which are prevalent in nature,22 might be exploited for the overall water splitting reaction. Further studies will have to be devoted to unraveling the real mechanistic pathway (heterolytic vs. homolytic) operating in this particular class of iron-based porphyrins23 as well as the exact kinetic role of the chloride anions.20
4. Experimental
4.1. General methods
All manipulations were carried out in a dry, oxygen-free nitrogen atmosphere using standard Schlenk techniques. Solvents were purified using a MB SPS-800 purification system. All starting materials were obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification. N,N-Dimethylformamide (Sigma Aldrich, anhydrous, 99.8%) and the supporting electrolyte NBu4PF6 was purchased from Fluka (puriss., electrochemical grade). 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker GPX (400 MHz) spectrometer and were referenced to the resonances of the solvents used (CDCl3 and DMSO-d6). UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded using a Specord 205 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer with quartz cuvettes of 1 cm pathlength. HRMS were recorded on a Water Q-TOF mass spectrometer (details: source ESI,† acetone as solvent) at the corresponding facilities of the CRMPO, “Centre Régional de Mesures Physiques de l'Ouest, Université de Rennes 1”. Molecular modelling calculations were performed using PM3-Spartan molecular modelling program.

Then, the crude was dissolved in CH2Cl2, dried with MgSO4 followed by solvent evaporation. 4′ was quantitatively obtained after drying under vacuum (0.18 g, 99%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ = 80.4, 14.4, 13.7, 13.5, 12.4. λabs/nm (DMF), (ε/103 M−1 cm−1): 421 (78.1), 519 (7.25), 577 (6.62). The data match those found in the literature.27


Synthesis of 2,2′,2′′,2′′′-(iron(III)porphine-5,10,15,20-tetrayl)tetrakis(benzoic acid) chloride (4). 
Porphyrin 4′ (0.166 g, 0.177 mmol) and LiOH (1.557 g, 65 mmol) were added to a mixture of 1,4-dioxane/water (68 mL, 1,4-dioxane:water, 7:1 v/v). Then, the reaction mixture was refluxed for 16 h at 105 °C. After cooling, 1,4-dioxane was evaporated followed by acidification with 1 M HCl until full precipitation. After filtration and drying under vacuum, 4 was quantitatively obtained (0.158 g, 99%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ = 73.4, 10.1, 9.7, 9.3. λabs/nm (DMF), (ε/103 M−1 cm−1): 426 (17.5), 515 (2.64), 573 (1.42). HRMS (ESI) calcd. for [M–Cl]+ C48H28N4O856Fe 844.1251, found 844.1249 (0 ppm). HRMS (ESI) calcd. for [M–Cl + CH3COCH3]+ C51H34N4O956Fe 902.1670, found 902.1658 (1 ppm). The data match those found in the literature.16

4.3. Electrochemical study

Cyclic voltammetry. 
Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were recorded in a home-made three neck cell with a gas inlet. The working electrode was a 3 mm-diameter glassy carbon (CH Instrument) disk carefully polished using a decreasing size of diamond paste (from 15 to 1 μm), ultrasonically cleaned in ultrapure water and dried before use. The counter-electrode was a graphite rod and the reference electrode was a KCl-saturated calomel electrode (SCE). All experiments were carried out under argon atmosphere at room temperature, CVs were obtained using a SP 150 (Bio-Logic) potentiostat. The CVs were recorded at 100 mV s−1. Unless specified, the ohmic drop was uncompensated. Catalytic onset potentials (Eonset) were determined at the beginning of the HER curve (i = 5 μA) at a concentration of the proton source of 10 mM.

4.4. Bulk electrolysis and faradaic efficiency

Bulk electrolysis. 
The experiments were carried out in a Hoffman cell with a glassy carbon rod (the active surface area was 5 cm2) as the working electrode, a SCE as the reference electrode, and graphite as the counter electrode, respectively. The cell contained 20 mL of 0.5 mM iron porphyrin, 15 mM Et3NHCl, and 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 in DMF. The electrolysis solution was purged with argon for 30 minutes prior to electrolysis measurements. The solution resistance was compensated using the potentiostat (measured as the impedance at high frequency). A CV curve was first recorded, and controlled-potential electrolysis was performed at a potential slightly more negative than the catalytic onset potential. After 1 hour, the electrolysis was stopped and the volume of the produced gas was measured.


Faradaic efficiency calculations. 
The HER Faradaic efficiency (η) was calculated by dividing the measured number of moles of H2 produced (nH2exp) by the theoretical amount of H2 (nH2th) expected on the basis of the charge (Q) consumed during the controlled-potential electrolysis measurements, calculated following the equation:  
The experimental number of moles of hydrogen was determined using the measured volume of produced gas in the cathodic compartment of the Hoffman cell, that was converted into the number of moles using the perfect gas law.

4.5. UV-vis titration studies of 1–4 and 2′–4′ with Et3NHCl

General procedure for UV-vis titrations. 
Host–guest interactions in solution were studied by UV-vis spectroscopy. A solution of each molecule (10−6 M except 10−5 M for 4) was prepared using N,N-dimethylformamide as the solvent. An increasing number of Et3NHCl equivalents were added to the solution of each molecule (1.5 mL in a 1 cm-pathlength quartz cell). The host concentration was kept constant. This study enabled us to qualitatively evidence the interaction between the molecule and ammonium salt (Et3NHCl). Note that the data were not accurate enough to determine binding constants, probably due to the presence of traces of water.
