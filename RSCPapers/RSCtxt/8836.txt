    , Accepted 7th February 2019First published on 9th February 2019AbstractA new pentadentate quinoline–pyridine ligand and its iron (1), cobalt (2) and nickel (3) complexes have been synthesized and characterized. The iron complex exhibits excellent photocatalytic activity towards CO2-to-CO conversion with a TON(CO) of 544 and a selectivity of 99.3% using the commercially available organic dye purpurin as the photosensitiser and BIH as the electron donor. In contrast, the cobalt and nickel complexes result in very low activity for CO production with a TON of only 8 and 15, respectively. On the other hand, all the three complexes show good electrocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction when using 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol as the proton source with the active intermediate of M0 species. The lack of activity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction by 2 and 3 can be attributed to the redox potential of MI/M0 which is significantly more negative than that of PP−/PP2− while in the case of 1 the FeI/Fe0 redox potential becomes more positive than that of the PP−/PP2− couple.
Introduction
Energy crises and environmental pollution caused by the consumption of fossil fuels are matters of increasing public concern. Effective technological innovations are required to solve these problems, and solar-driven CO2 reduction is considered as a promising way to reduce the climate-changing CO2 emission as well as fossil fuel consumption, since the generated products such as CO, CH4 and CH3OH are renewable fuels which can be further converted to high-value-added products.1–6 Given the high stability of CO2, an appropriate catalyst is necessary for solar-driven CO2 reduction. Compared with heterogeneous catalysts, molecular catalysts are in general less stable. However, their reactivity and selectivity are usually better and can be readily tuned by ligand modification. Inspired by the pioneering work of Lehn,7 Tinnemans8 and Tanaka,9 many molecule-based photocatalytic systems have been developed employing three components (sensitizer, catalyst and sacrificial reductant). Ru(II) complexes bearing polypyridine ligands and cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes are usually used as photosensitizers due to their strong reducing power and photophysical properties.7,10 Many noble metal complexes, such as those of Re,11–13 Ru14–16 and Ir,17,18 are found to be efficient catalysts for CO2 reduction. There are also a number of reports using earth-abundant metal complexes as catalysts, such as Mn,19–22 Fe,23–29 Co,28,30–36 Ni,8,10,37–39 and Cu complexes.40,41
On the other hand, there are few photocatalytic CO2 reduction systems where all the components are constructed from earth-abundant materials. For example, Bonin and Robert reported the use of the organic dye 9-cyanoanthracene or purpurin as the sensitizer and substituted iron(III) tetraphenylporphyrin as the catalyst for CO2-to-CO conversion, with a turnover number (TON) around 50 to 120.23,42 Ishitani and co-workers reported the use of a dimeric Cu(I) complex as the photosensitizer and a Fe(II) phenanthroline complex as the catalyst for CO2 reduction to CO with a TON of 270 and selectivity of 78%.24 Very recently, Beller and co-workers reported a highly selective system based on an in situ formed copper sensitizer and a cyclopentadienone iron catalyst for reducing CO2 to CO. The TON, selectivity and quantum yield were up to 487 (5 h), 99% and 13.3%, respectively.
We have previously reported that an iron complex bearing a macrocyclic pentaaza ligand, [FeL]2+ (L = 2,13-dimethyl-3,6,9,12,18-pentaazabicyclo-[12.3.1]octadeca-1(18),2,12,14,16-pentaene) is a selective catalyst for the reduction of CO2 to formate while another iron complex [Fe(qpy)(H2O)2]2+ (qpy = 2,2′:6′,2′′:6′′,2′′′-quaterpyridine) is much more efficient and selective for CO2-to-CO conversion.28,32,43,44 Since polypyridines are considered as strong and versatile chelating ligands to generate diverse architectures of complexes, we herein designed a new pentadentate quinoline–pyridine ligand dqtpy (dqtpy = 6,6′′-di(quinolin-8-yl)-2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine) and its iron, cobalt and nickel complexes [M(dqtpy)(H2O)]2+ (M = Fe(1), Co(2) and Ni(3), Scheme 1). 1 is found to be a highly efficient and selective catalyst for the visible light-driven reduction of CO2 to CO using the organic dye purpurin (PP) as the photosensitizer and 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]imidazole (BIH) as the sacrificial reductant (see the structures of PP and BIH in Scheme S1 in the ESI†).

Results and discussion
The pentadentate ligand dqtpy was synthesized in 94% yield by coupling 6,6′′-dibromo-2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine with quinolin-8-ylboronic acid (Scheme 1). Treatment of M(ClO4)2·6H2O (M = Fe, Co and Ni) in ethanol with one equiv. of the dqtpy ligand in dichloromethane at room temperature afforded metal complexes of the general formula of [M(dqtpy)(H2O)](ClO4)2 (M = Fe(1), Co(2) and Ni(3), Scheme 1). The complexes were characterized by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI/MS), UV−Vis spectroscopy and elemental analysis (Fig. S1 and S2, see the ESI†). Single crystals suitable for X-ray crystallographic analysis were obtained by diffusing diethyl ether into an MeCN solution of 1 or 2 (Scheme 1). Both the MII coordination complexes adopt a distorted octahedral geometry with one MeCN molecule and quinoline nitrogen at the axial positions. Pertinent geometric features, selected bond lengths (Å) and angles (°) are listed in Tables S1–S4 (see the ESI†).
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to evaluate the efficacy of the metal complexes 1, 2 and 3 to reduce CO2 under electrochemical conditions. First, redox potentials were determined in MeCN under an Ar atmosphere (Table S5†). 1 shows two reversible waves at −0.80 V and −1.06 V vs. SCE, which can be assigned to the FeII/FeI and FeI/Fe0 couples (Fig. 1 and Fig. S3†). The third quasi-reversible wave at −1.78 V is predominantly due to dqtpy/dqtpy−·, since the potential is similar to the reduction wave of the free ligand. 2 and 3 show very similar electrochemical properties, however, their MI/M0 reduction potentials (−1.47 V for 2 and −1.40 V for 3) are much more negative than that of the FeI/Fe0 couple. Under a CO2 atmosphere, the CV of 1 exhibits enhanced catalytic current with an onset catalytic potential around −1.5 V (Fig. S3†). Addition of the weak Brønsted acid 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) increases the current intensity, and more interestingly, the onset potential shifted to around −1.2 V, whereas there is little or no shift for 2 and 3 (Fig. 1, Fig. S4 and S5†). Similar behaviour was observed by replacing the solvent MeCN with DMF (Fig. S6†). These results suggest that 1 is a potentially a good catalyst for CO2 reduction.
 Fig. 1  CVs of 1, 2 and 3 under an Ar atmosphere (left) and CO2 atmosphere in the presence of 3 M TFE (right) in 0.1 M nBu4NPF6 in MeCN with a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1. 
The photocatalytic activity of complexes 1, 2 and 3 towards CO2 reduction was then evaluated by using the organic dye purpurin (PP) as the photosensitizer and BIH as the sacrificial reductant with blue LED light irradiation (centred at 460 nm). 1 was first investigated to determine the optimized conditions for catalysis. A series of solvents, including N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP), MeCN and tetrahydrofuran (THF), were examined, and DMF was found to be the best solvent for CO2 reduction (Table S6†). Furthermore, addition of 5% (v/v) TFE nearly doubled the yield of CO. As shown in Fig. 2 (left) and Table 1 (entry 1), upon irradiation of a mixture of 1 (0.05 mM), PP (0.05 mM), BIH (0.1 M) and 5% TFE in CO2-saturated DMF for 15 h, CO and H2 were produced with a TON of 544 and 4, respectively, as analysed by gas chromatography (GC). The selectivity for CO is up to 99.3%. In the liquid phase, only a trace amount of formate was detected by ion chromatography (IC). In contrast, 2 and 3 produced a very small amount of CO (entries 2 and 3 in Table 1), with a TON of only 8 and 15, respectively. This is attributed to the more negative CoI/Co0 (−1.47 V vs. SCE) and NiI/Ni0 (−1.40 V) potentials than the FeI/Fe0 (−1.06 V) potential. Since E(PP−/2−) = −1.22 V vs. SCE,28 this means the photochemically generated PP2− will be able to reduce FeI to Fe0 (the active species) but not CoI and NiI. Hence the reactivity of the catalysts follows the order 1 ≫ 3 > 2. It is worth noting that the ratio of [PP] to [1] is 1:1, so the TON based on the photosensitizer is the same as that based on the catalyst, which is better than most of the recently reported noble-metal-free photocatalytic systems using molecular complexes as catalysts (Table S7†).

Kinetic studies were performed and the yield of CO was found to increase almost linearly with [1] (0.005 to 0.05 mM, Fig. 2), suggesting a single site iron catalytic process. The TON is constant within this range of catalyst concentration, which is different from that of the catalyst [Fe(qpy)(H2O)2]2+.28 On the other hand, when the concentration of purpurin was increased, the selectivity and TON based on the catalyst increased but the TON vs. purpurin decreased (Table S6†).
Control experiments show that all components, namely the catalyst 1, the sensitizer PP, the electron donor BIH and the visible light source, are required for the production of CO (Table 1, entries 4–7). In the absence of TFE, the TON of CO decreased by 50% to 280, suggesting that TFE plays an important role in facilitating C–O bond cleavage (Table 1, entries 8).26 When using Fe(ClO4)2 instead of 1 as the catalyst, no CO was produced and only a small amount of H2 was detected (Table 1, entry 9). When photocatalysis was carried out under Ar (Table 1, entry 10), no CO was observed either, indicating that CO is derived from CO2 rather than from the other components in the photocatalytic system. This is further confirmed by 13C-labeling experiments under a 13CO2 atmosphere, which produced 13CO (Fig. S7†).
Although 1 shows high efficiency and selectivity, the catalysis stops after 15 h. Two experiments were carried to better understand the factors that cause the catalysis to stop. Addition of a second batch of PP could not reactivate the catalytic system. On the other hand, around 84% of the catalytic activity was restored by adding the fresh catalyst 1, indicating that 1 was deactivated after the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. S8†). As recently shown with the [Fe(qpy)(H2O)2]2+ catalyst, the adduct which is formed between the iron complex and CO during the catalytic process may be reduced to an inactive species in competition with CO release.44
To examine the possibility of heterogeneous catalysis by nanoparticles, dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements and mercury poisoning tests were performed. No particles in the solution were observed by DLS even after photoirradiation for 15 h (Fig. S9†), indicating that the catalytic reaction is homogeneous. Experiments carried out in the absence and presence of 0.2 mL Hg(0) gave the same results (Fig. S10†). The lack of catalysis by Fe(ClO4)2 is also evidence that the catalytic activity does not arise from the demetalation of the iron catalyst. All these results support that 1 is a highly efficient molecular catalyst.
The quantum yield (Φ) for CO production (ΦCO) was determined by ferrioxalate actinometry using following equation: ΦCO = (number of CO molecules)/(number of incident photons) × 100%. ΦCO was found to be 0.12% after irradiation for 3 h at 460 nm (see the ESI† for details).
Luminescence quenching experiments were performed in order to get insights into the photocatalytic mechanism. Quenching of PP* with BIH was first investigated. The excited-state lifetime τ0 of PP was 1.00 ns, and the apparent quenching rate constant kq of emission from the photosensitizer PP with BIH is determined to be 1.16 × 1010 M−1 s−1 from the Stern–Volmer plot (Fig. S11†), indicating highly effective quenching. The UV-Vis absorption spectral changes of the solution containing PP (0.05 mM) and BIH (0.05 M) were also monitored during irradiation. The bands around 533 nm and 571 nm due to PP diminished during irradiation, while a new band around 398 nm appeared (Fig. 3) and the colour of the solution changed from purple to brownish yellow. When BIH was replaced by 1 as the quencher, the lifetime of PP did not decrease and the colour of the solution containing PP (0.05 mM) and 1 (0.05 mM) remained purple during irradiation. These result suggest that in the photocatalytic cycle, PP* was first reductively quenched by the strong two-electron donor BIH45 to give the reduced species PP2–. The UV-Vis absorption spectral changes of the solution containing all the three components were also monitored, and the absorbance at 398 nm was found to be much lower than that without catalyst 1 (Fig. 3 and Fig. S12†), indicating that the PP2– was consumed by the reaction with 1. The absorbance at 398 nm did not decrease either when using Fe(ClO4)2 as the catalyst (Fig. S13†). Accordingly, the reduction of 1 by PP2– generates the active intermediate for CO2 to CO conversion, as previously reported using [Ru(bpy)3]2+ and PP as photosensitizers.28

A proposed mechanism for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction based on the electrochemical and quenching studies is shown in Scheme 2. Catalyst 1 was doubly reduced to Fe0 species to activate CO2 followed by the protonation and cleavage of the C–O bond. CO was finally released with the regeneration of the FeII catalyst. Further work on spectroscopic electrochemistry and DFT calculations is in progress to shed more light on the intermediates and the mechanism.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have synthesized and characterized a new quinoline–pyridine ligand and the corresponding iron, cobalt and nickel complexes. All of them show good electrocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction. However, only 1 is a highly efficient and selective catalyst for the visible light-driven reduction of CO2 to CO using the cheap organic dye purpurin as the photosensitizer and BIH as the sacrificial reductant. Our results indicate that the M0 species is the active intermediate in this catalytic system. 1 is the most active catalyst because the reduction potential of FeI/Fe0 matches well with that of PP−/PP2−, but not in the case of cobalt and nickel catalysts. Our results should provide valuable insights into the design of efficient catalysts for CO2 reduction. For example, by introducing electron-withdrawing substituents onto the dqtpy ligand, it should be possible to shift the CoI/Co0 and NiI/Ni0 potentials to a more positive direction so as to match with the PP−/PP2− potential. Our work should also contribute to the advance of photocatalytic systems for CO2 reduction based on earth-abundant materials.

General procedures

Photocatalytic CO2 reduction. 
In a typical run, a DMF solution (2 mL) containing 1 (0.05 mM), purpurin (0.05 mM), BIH (0.1 M) and TFE (5%, v/v) was put in a glass tube sealed with a rubber septum. The inner volume of the tube is 12.3 mL. The solution was bubbled with CO2 for 30 min before irradiation by using a blue LED light strip (centred at 460 nm) wrapped around a beaker filled with water. The gaseous products, i.e., H2 and CO in the headspace were analyzed by GC/TCD (Agilent 7820) fit with a Molsieve 5 Å PLOT column (CP7534, 30 m × 0.32 mm × 10 μm). No alkane, alkene or alkyne was detected. The calibration curves were obtained by filling pure H2 and CO gas to a tube with a graduated gastight syringe. GC-MS (Agilent 6890–5975 with a DB-5MS column, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) and ion chromatography (ICS 1600 with a Dionex IonPac AS22 column) were used to analyze the liquid reaction products in the solution. 13C-labeling experiments were conducted following the same procedure except 13CO2 was used and the gaseous products were analyzed by GC-TCD and GC-MS.


Electrochemical studies. 
Cyclic voltammetry was performed with a CHI 660E instrument. The three-electrode set-up consisted of a glassy carbon working electrode (CHI 104, 0.071 cm2), a Pt wire counter electrode (CHI 115) and a saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE, CHI 150). The working electrode was polished with α-Al2O3 (successively 0.3, 0.1, and 0.05 μm, 1 min each), thoroughly rinsed and with H2O and ethanol. The solution was purged with argon or CO2. All reported potentials in this study are versus SCE at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1.


Quantum yield determination. 
A blue LED light strip (18 modules, centered at 460 nm) was used for evaluating the number of photons. The average light intensity taken before and after the photochemical reaction was 1.76 × 10−6 Einstein per s. Typically for the photochemical reaction, a quartz cell (light path length = 1 cm) containing 0.05 mM 1, 0.05 mM purpurin, 0.1 M BIH and 5% TFE in a CO2-saturated CH3CN solution (2 mL) was irradiated with blue LED light. The solution was vigorously stirred during irradiation. The amount of CO after irradiation for 3 h was determined by GC-TCD. The quantum yield for CO2 reduction to CO was calculated using the following equation:  


Fluorescence quenching. 
The excited-state lifetime (τ0) of PP* was measured with a FLS 980 fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh instruments). The quenching experiments were performed by the addition of various amounts of BIH or catalyst 1 to an anaerobic DMF solution of purpurin (0.05 mM). The relative emission lifetime of the characteristic emission of purpurin at 700 nm in the presence of different concentrations of BIH or catalyst 1 was used to calculate the quenching rate constant (kq) according to the Stern–Volmer equation.I0/I or τ0/τ = 1 + kqτ0 [Q]where I0 and I are the emission intensity in the absence and presence of the quencher, τ0 and τ are the excited state lifetime in the absence and presence of the quencher, kq is the bimolecular quenching rate constant, and [Q] is the molar concentration of the quencher.


Dynamic light scattering. 
Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were performed by using a Zetasizer Nano ZS instrument (Malvern Instruments Ltd, USA), which can detect particle sizes ranging from 0.6–6000 nm. The light source was a He–Ne gas laser (4 mW, λ = 632.8 nm). Data were obtained by using a scattering angle of 175° at a temperature of 23 °C.
