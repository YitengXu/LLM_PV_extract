    , Accepted 4th January 2018First published on 4th January 2018AbstractHere, the crucial role of intermolecular π–π interactions in A–D–A-type acceptors is examined and a simple yet effective modulation method is presented. By side chain manipulation, two small molecule acceptors, IDT-C6 and IDT-PhC6, are designed and synthesized with different crystalline morphologies. Since n-hexyl side chains have less steric hindrance than hexylphenyl side chains, IDT-C6 exhibits enhanced intermolecular π–π interactions relative to IDT-PhC6. Benefiting from the improved charge transport properties of the IDT-C6-based device, a high PCE of 12.5% is recorded, whereas those of the IDT-PhC6-based device delivers a moderate PCE of just 5.6%.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have aroused worldwide interest over the past two decades for their advantages of being lightweight and their versatility in generating clean and low cost energy.1–14 The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs have been boosted to over 13%,15 suggesting their great potential in practical applications in the near future. The development of novel and highly efficient organic photovoltaic materials, including p-type electron donors and n-type electron acceptors, contributes much to the rapid progress of OSCs. Since organic semiconductors usually have weaker crystallinity than mono- or poly-crystalline inorganic materials, the intermolecular charge transport in OSCs is highly dependent on the extent of orbital overlap of π-electrons. Therefore, the manipulation of intermolecular π–π interactions in organic photovoltaic materials is of great importance in determining the performance of the resultant OSCs. Over the past two decades, some efficient strategies have been developed to control supramolecular assemblies to obtain enhanced intermolecular π–π interactions for organic semiconductors; broadly, these strategies can be divided into two main categories: film-processing engineering and molecular optimization. The most commonly used film-processing methods include solvent additive selection16,17 and thermal vapor annealing,18,19 which have contributed greatly to the optimization of donor and acceptor crystalline morphologies. Compared with these post-processing strategies, molecular optimization is an efficient method that focuses on the molecular scale, by which the intermolecular assembly behavior is controlled.20–22
Fullerene derivatives have functioned as the dominant electron acceptors for decades, and the manipulation of the intermolecular π–π interactions by molecular optimization was usually achieved via the donors with great success.23–25 For example, when the zigzagged polymer chain was replaced by a straight linear backbone, the resulting polymer was more likely to reorganize with more ordered inter-chain packing, and thus higher crystalline morphology.26–28 Although the state-of-the-art PCEs of fullerene-based OSCs have surpassed 11%,29 it is very difficult to further improve this value due to the intrinsic drawbacks of fullerene derivatives, such as weak absorption in the visible light region, limited tunability of molecular energy levels, and large energy losses in the devices.30,31 Recently, researchers have focused on non-fullerene-based OSCs, and many highly efficient non-fullerene acceptors have been developed based on core structures like naphthalene diimide (NDI),24,32–34 perylene diimide (PDI),26,29,35,36 and indacenodithiophene (IDT) units.26,37–43 Among these, the acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A)-type acceptors achieved significant progress in OSCs as their molecular energy levels, and hence absorption spectra, can be tuned effectively by manipulating the intramolecular charge transfer interactions between the donor and acceptor moieties. Unlike spherical isotropic fullerenes, the anisotropic character of planar A–D–A acceptors causes their charge transport properties to depend strongly on intermolecular π–π interactions. Therefore, manipulating the acceptor assemblies by judiciously designing their charge transport channels is vital for determining the photovoltaic performance of A–D–A-type electron acceptors.
In this contribution, we highlight the crucial role of intermolecular π–π interactions for A–D–A-type acceptors and present a simple yet effective modulation method. Two A–D–A acceptors, IDT-C6 and IDT-PhC6,15 were designed and synthesized by selecting IDT units with n-hexyl or hexylphenyl as the side chains. On account of the distinct steric hindrance effects of the linear n-hexyl moiety versus the bulky hexylphenyl moiety, the two acceptors show dissimilar crystalline morphologies; specifically, IDT-C6 possesses a more ordered intermolecular arrangement and closer π–π distance than IDT-PhC6. As OSCs, the IDT-C6-based device demonstrates an impressive PCE of up to 12.5%, whereas the IDT-PhC6-based device delivers a moderate PCE of only 5.6%. Detailed blend morphology studies suggest that the IDT-C6 blend has a face-on ordered orientation, which contributes to the efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport in the vertical direction. Both the theoretical analysis and experimental results suggest that strong intermolecular π–π interactions are necessary for these acceptors to form efficient charge transport channels, and the manipulation of orbital overlap between the end groups is a feasible and straightforward way to achieve this goal in A–D–A-type molecules. This study highlights the important role of intermolecular π–π interactions in acceptors and reveals the relationship between the molecular structure and device performance in non-fullerene OSCs.
Results and discussion
Material design and theoretical study

Scheme 1 shows the molecular structures of IDT-C6 and IDT-PhC6, where the IDT unit end-capped by 2-(5-methyl-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile is used as the conjugated backbone. The linear and bulky n-hexyl and hexylphenyl groups are used as the side chains in IDT-C6 and IDT-PhC6, respectively. These moieties were chosen not only to ensure effective solubility of IDT-C6 and IDT-PhC6, but also because they have a great influence on intermolecular π–π packing and thus charge transport properties. The detailed synthetic procedures (Scheme 1) and characterizations (Fig. S1†) are provided in the ESI.† Thermogravimetric measurements show that both acceptors have decomposition temperatures (5% weight loss) above 350 °C (Fig. S2†). Further, they can be dissolved in commonly used solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform, and chlorobenzene. The IDT-PhC6 films spin-coated from chlorobenzene are very uniform, whereas the IDT-C6 films exhibit many solid particles (Fig. S3†), suggesting that IDT-C6 is more likely to form aggregates in the drying process. Therefore, chloroform, which possesses a low boiling point, was chosen as the processing solvent for the following characterizations of the acceptors and fabrication of the OSC devices.

We first applied density functional theory calculations to evaluate the effect of structure optimization on the molecular geometries and electronic properties of IDT-C6 and IDT-PhC6 using the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory. As illustrated in Fig. S4,† the optimized geometries and electron density distributions of the frontier molecular orbitals do not differ considerably between the two molecules. The side chains on the core units result in large steric hindrance for effective intermolecular interactions; thus, the local π–π interactions formed by the terminal groups likely provide the dominant charge transport channels.3,44 The calculated molecular energy levels (i.e., the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)) of IDT-PhC6 are ∼0.03 eV higher than that of IDT-C6, as summarized in Table 1. To gain a better understanding of the intermolecular π–π interaction effect on intermolecular packing, we investigated the geometries of dimer models of the two molecules. According to the literature,45–48 the long-range-corrected density functional wB97XD, which possesses tuned range-separation parameters, is capable of describing this effect. As shown in Fig. S5,† the results show that the dimer distance is 3.5 and 3.7 Å for IDT-C6 and IDT-PhC6, respectively; the larger distance for IDT-PhC6 can be ascribed to the larger steric hindrance because of its hexylphenyl side chain.

Optical absorption and molecular energy levels
We measured the absorption spectra of IDT-C6 and IDT-PhC6 in dilute solutions and as thin films, as displayed in Fig. 1a. In chloroform solutions, both acceptors show strong absorption from 500 to 700 nm, with the main absorption peaks of IDT-C6 and IDT-PhC6 at 663 and 652 nm, respectively. From solution to film, the main peak of IDT-C6 shows a 32 nm red shift, whereas IDT-PhC6 shows a red shift of only 16 nm (see Table 1 for specific details). The absorption coefficient of the IDT-C6 film is 20% higher than that of IDT-PhC6 (1.35 × 105vs. 1.14 × 105 cm−1, Fig. S6†). The optical bandgaps (Eoptg) calculated from the absorption onsets are 1.65 and 1.74 eV for the IDT-C6 and IDT-PhC6 films, respectively. The absorption spectra indicate that the intermolecular packing of the IDT-C6 molecules is more likely to be ordered in the films than the IDT-PhC6 molecules, which agrees well with the theoretical studies.

We also evaluated the molecular energy levels of the two acceptors via cyclic voltammetry (CV). The results are illustrated in Fig. 1b and the detailed values are shown in Table 1. As seen, the LUMO level of IDT-C6 is −3.98 eV, which is lower than that of IDT-PhC6 by 40 meV. In OSCs, IDT-C6-based devices are expected to have lower open-circuit voltages (VOC) than IDT-PhC6-based devices, since VOC is empirically proportional to the energy gap between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor. The calculated electrochemical gaps of IDT-C6 and IDT-PhC6 are 1.72 and 1.75 eV, respectively, which differ slightly from their corresponding Eoptg values due to the different measurement methods employed.
Crystalline properties and proposed molecular packing models
We investigated the influence of side chain engineering on the crystalline morphology of IDT-C6 and IDT-PhC6 thin films by the grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) technique. As presented in Fig. 2a, the IDT-C6 film shows a strong and sharp (010) diffraction peak at 1.71 Å−1 in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction and clear (h00) diffraction signals in the in-plane (IP) direction, implying a preferential face-on orientation of IDT-C6 crystallites. The π–π interaction and laminar packing distances are 3.67 and 17.95 Å for IDT-C6, respectively. Compared with IDT-C6, IDT-PhC6 shows very weak crystalline properties. In both the OOP and IP directions, the (010) diffraction peaks are very weak and (100) signals can be observed, suggesting that the IDT-PhC6 film has an amorphous packing morphology. The π–π interaction distance calculated from the (010) diffraction peaks is 3.76 Å, and the laminar packing distance is over 29 Å.

Based on the GIWAXS results, we have proposed molecular packing models of both acceptors, as illustrated in Fig. 2d. Due to the large steric hindrance effect, the bulky hexylphenyl chains in IDT-PhC6 impede overlap of the molecular orbitals distributed on the end groups, which leads to inefficient intermolecular π–π interactions and enlarges the laminar stacking distance, resulting in its amorphous packing morphology. In contrast, the flexible and short alkyl chains of the n-hexyl side chains do not negatively impact the assembly behavior of IDT-C6 and are thus able to form a tight and ordered face-on orientation morphology. The different π–π intermolecular interactions and packing morphologies affect the charge transport properties of the two acceptors, as evidenced by electron mobility measurements using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. As plotted in Fig. S7,† IDT-C6 possesses a high electron mobility of 3.85 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, whereas IDT-PhC6 shows a low electron mobility of 1.37 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. The crystalline morphology and charge mobility observations are consistent with the optical properties, which will have a great impact on their photovoltaic performance.
Photovoltaic performance
To investigate the photovoltaic performances of IDT-C6 and IDT-PhC6, their corresponding OSCs were fabricated with the conventional configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/donor:acceptor/poly[(9,9-bis(3′-((N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium)-propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)]dibromide (PFN-Br)/Al, where PEDOT:PSS and PFN-Br served as the anode and cathode interlayers, respectively. In order to generate high VOC values, the polymer PBDB-TF (the number-average molecular weight is 22.9 kDa, and the polydispersity index is 2.3, as measured by gel-permeation chromatography) with a low-lying HOMO level (−5.48 eV, Fig. 1b) was incorporated as the donor in the OSCs;49 PBDB-TF has strong absorption in the range of 500–650 nm. We optimized the device performance using common methods, including scanning the donor:acceptor (D:A) weight ratio and using solvent additive and thermal annealing. The detailed photovoltaic parameters for the optimization process are listed in Table S1.†
As shown in the current density–voltage (J–V) curves (Fig. 3a) and the detailed photovoltaic parameters provided in Table 2, the optimal PBDB-TF:IDT-C6-based device demonstrates a maximum PCE of 12.5% with a VOC of 0.96 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 17.5 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.74, which is among the top PCE values for OSCs. The PBDB-TF:IDT-PhC6-based device shows a higher VOC of 1.00 V due to its high-lying LUMO level, but its JSC (13.0 mA cm−2) and FF (0.43) are considerably diminished, leading to a moderate PCE of 5.6%. Fig. 3b depicts the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the devices. The broader photo-response region and higher EQE values of the PBDB-TF:IDT-C6-based device verify its high JSC, with an integrated current density of 16.5 mA cm−2. In comparison, the PBDB-TF:IDT-PhC6-based device displays a narrow photo-response region and low EQE values; the integrated current density is 12.3 mA cm−2. The maximum EQE value of PBDB-TF:IDT-C6 at 680 nm reaches 80%, suggesting that the utilization of solar photons, including exciton dissociation and charge transport, is very efficient in the OSC device based on PBDB-TF:IDT-C6.

To gain more insight into the exciton dissociation and charge transport processes in the OSCs, analysis of the photocurrent (Jph, the current density under illumination minus the dark current density) was performed and the hole and electron mobilities of the blends were measured. As plotted in Fig. S8,†Jph was measured as a function of the effective voltage (Veff, the voltage where Jph = 0 minus the applied bias), from which we can calculate the exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss defined as the ratio of Jph/Jsat and Jsat is the saturation current density at high Veff). In this way, the values of Pdiss were determined to be 93% and 89% for the PBDB-TF:IDT-C6- and PBDB-TF:IDT-PhC6-based devices under short-circuit conditions, respectively, implying that more efficient exciton dissociation occurs in the PBDB-TF:IDT-C6-based device.
Next, we studied the charge recombination kinetics by measuring the dependence of JSC on light intensity (Plight); the results are plotted in Fig. S8.†50 The power-law exponents for the equation JSC ∝ Plightα for the devices based on PBDB-TF:IDT-C6 and PBDB-TF:IDT-PhC6 are 0.97 and 0.94, respectively. As Plight increases, the FF of the PBDB-TF:IDT-PhC6-based device decreases rapidly, whereas that of the PBDB-TF:IDT-C6-based device is well maintained (Fig. 3c). These results suggest that the bimolecular recombination in the PBDB-TF:IDT-C6 device is more suppressed, which can be ascribed to its high and balanced charge mobilities. Overall, the combined effects of efficient exciton dissociation, charge transport, and extraction contribute to the higher JSC and FF values of the PBDB-TF:IDT-C6 OSCs.
Without question, charge transport plays a fundamental role in OSCs. Carrier mobility of the donor and acceptor materials can be affected by the blend morphology. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the charge-carrier mobility of the blended films, photo-induced charge-carrier extraction by linearly increasing voltage (photo-CELIV) measurements were conducted, which is sensitive to the fastest carriers instead of one specific carrier.51 As depicted in Fig. 3d, the charge carrier mobility (μ) is calculated using eqn (1): (1)where d is the active layer thickness, A is the voltage rise speed, tmax is the time corresponding to the extraction peak maximum, and j(0) is the displacement current. The photo-CELIV mobilities of PBDB-TF:IDT-C6 and PBDB-TF:IDT-PhC6 are 4.2 × 10−4 and 9.3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The charge mobilities of the blends were also measured via the SCLC method, as provided in Fig. S9.† The PBDB-TF:IDT-C6 shows symmetric hole (3.39 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and electron (3.85 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) mobilities, whereas the ratio between the hole (2.06 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and electron (1.37 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) mobilities of the PBDB-TF:IDT-PhC6 blend reaches 15. Therefore, the low electron mobility of PBDB-TF:IDT-PhC6 will limit charge extraction, which is consistent with its lower JSC and FF values.
Blend morphology
In order to gain a deeper understanding of the influence of the device morphology on its performance, detailed morphology characterizations of the PBDB-TF:IDT-C6 and PBDB-TF:IDT-PhC6 blends were conducted using GIWAXS, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As presented in Fig. 4, the 2D GIWAXS pattern of PBDB-TF:IDT-C6 shows a preferentially face-on orientation with respect to the substrate, and the obtuse peak around qz = 1.65 Å−1 can be assigned to the diffraction peak overlap between the donor and acceptor. The PBDB-TF:IDT-PhC6 blend shows very weak (010) diffraction signals in both the OOP and IP directions. These blend morphologies are very similar to those of neat acceptors, suggesting that the crystalline properties of the acceptors remained intact after blending with the polymer donor.

The surface and bulk morphologies of the two blends were measured by AFM and TEM, respectively. Fig. 4 displays the AFM height images of the two blends, and both of them exhibit uniform and smooth surfaces. The root-mean-square roughness (Rq) of the PBDB-TF:IDT-C6 film (2.86 nm) is higher than that of the PBDB-TF:IDT-PhC6 film (1.51 nm), and larger fiber-like aggregation domains can be observed in the phase image of the PBDB-TF:IDT-C6 film. The TEM images indicate that finely interpenetrated networks are formed in the two blends (Fig. S10†), and the aggregation domains in the PBDB-TF:IDT-C6 film are slightly larger than those in the PBDB-TF:IDT-PhC6 film. Overall, these morphology characterizations indicate that the PBDB-TF:IDT-C6 film possesses higher ordered packing than PBDB-TF:IDT-PhC6 due to the stronger crystalline properties of IDT-C6 relative to IDT-PhC6, which should contribute to efficient exciton dissociation, charge transport, and extraction in devices prepared with IDT-C6.
These results demonstrate that strong intermolecular π–π interactions of the acceptors have a great impact on their photovoltaic performance. However, it does not mean that the acceptors with hexylphenyl will have bad performance. When the hexylphenyl side chains are used on the core units of the acceptors, relatively large terminal groups are usually necessary to provide more interaction area. As provided in Fig. S11,† all the acceptors ITIC,40 IT-4F15 and m-ITIC52 contain the hexylphenyl side chains and showed very good photovoltaic performance in the OSCs. These acceptors consist of the IDTT core with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene on the both ends, which provide more exposed area for forming intermolecular interactions. In addition, inserting a π bridge (ATT-1)53 or extending the conjugated unit (IDTN)54 of the end-groups can also enlarge the interaction area, and has been demonstrated to be effective in enhancing the intermolecular π–π interaction.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this study highlights the critical role of intermolecular π–π interactions in A–D–A-type small molecular acceptors. By using side chain engineering, the acceptors IDT-C6 and IDT-PhC6 were synthesized with the same conjugated backbone. However, since n-hexyl side chains have less steric hindrance than hexylphenyl side chains, essential intermolecular packing via the end groups can be realized only in IDT-C6, thus enhancing its crystalline properties. In contrast, the bulkier hexylphenyl side chains of IDT-PhC6 disrupt effective intermolecular stacking, resulting in its amorphous morphology. The blend morphology studies suggest that the IDT-C6-based film has a more ordered face-on molecular packing than the IDT-PhC6-based film, which benefits charge transport in the device. Due to efficient charge generation, transport, and extraction processes of the IDT-C6-based OSC, a high PCE of 12.5% with a VOC of 0.96 V, a JSC of 17.5 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.74 is recorded. By comparison, the IDT-PhC6-based OSC exhibits a moderate PCE of only 5.6%. These results imply that strong intermolecular π–π interactions are prerequisite for highly efficient A–D–A-type acceptors with planar structures and provide a general guideline for designing novel non-fullerene acceptors.
Experimental section
Materials and synthesis
Polymer donor PBDB-TF, small molecule IDTPhC6-CHO, IDTC6-CHO, and EG-CH3-DCI were synthesized according to the reported literature.38,49 The other reagents and solvents used were purchased from commercial sources and used as received.

Synthesis of IDT-PhC6. 
Materials IDTPhC6-CHO (0.193 g, 0.2 mmol) and CH3-DCI (0.250 g, 1.2 mmol) were added to a 100 ml two-necked flask, successively. Solvent CHCl3 (20 ml) was then added and the two compounds were fully dissolved by stirring for a while. After being flushed by a gentle stream of dry nitrogen for 15 min, pyridine (0.4 ml) was added as the catalyst and the solution slowly turned blue-green. The mixture was refluxed at 65 °C for 20 h, and most of the solvent was evaporated. The crude product was washed with methanol to remove the excess CH3-DCI, and further purified by column chromatography with petroleum ether:CH2Cl2 (4:1) as the eluent to obtain the material IDT-PhC6 as a dark purple solid (0.218 g, 81% yield). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3, d): 8.81–8.80 (d, J = 5 Hz, 2H) (J = 5 Hz, 2H), 8.45–8.42 (d, J = 8 Hz, 2H), 7.75 (s, 2.21H), 7.72–7.69 (d, J = 8 Hz, 2.32H), 7.59 (s, 1.48H), 7.38–7.36 (d, J = 8 Hz, 0.77H), 7.31–7.28 (d, J = 8 Hz, 1.84H), 7.20–7.13 (m, 16H), 2.63–2.58 (t, 8H), 2.42–2.39 (d, J = 8 Hz, 6H), 1.64–1.57 (m, 8H), 1.36–1.28 (m, 24H), 0.89–0.85 (t, 12H). 13C NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 188.5, 188.3, 160.5, 160.4, 158.4, 158.3, 157.8, 156.3, 146.9, 146.4, 142.3, 141.4, 140.4, 140.3, 139.1, 138.1, 137.6, 137.3, 137.1, 136.2, 135.6, 134.8, 128.8, 127.7, 125.7, 125.3, 124.1, 123.7, 123.1, 123.0, 119.9, 114.8, 114.7, 69.2, 68.6, 63.0, 35.6, 31.7, 31.3, 29.1, 22.6, 22.1, and 14.1.

Solar cell fabrication
ITO glasses were cleaned with a surfactant scrub and washed with water, acetone, and isopropanol for 20 min each. After UV-ozone treatment for 15 min, PEDOT:PSS (∼10 nm thick) was spin-coated onto the ITO glass as the cathode interlayer and annealed at 150 °C for 15 min. The blend solution of PBDB-TF:IDT-C6 was fully dissolved in chloroform (CF) at a polymer weight concentration of 8 mg mL−1, and a 0.5% volume ratio of 1,8-iodooctane (DIO) was used as the solvent additive. The spin-coated active layer thickness was ∼110 nm, as measured by a Bruker Dektak XT profilometer. Then, the active layer films were treated by thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 min, followed by coating the films' top with PFN-Br (∼5 nm). Finally, approximately 80 nm of Al was deposited onto the active layer under high vacuum, giving an area of 4.15 mm2. Except for the spin coating of the PEDOT:PSS cathode interlayer, the other preparation processes were all carried out in a nitrogen-filled glovebox.
Instruments and measurements
Device characterization and measurement: The standard AM 1.5 G spectrum (100 mW cm−2) was used to measure the photovoltaic performance of the PSC devices. An integrated quantum efficiency measurement system, named QE-R3011 (Enli Technology Co. Ltd., Taiwan), was used to record the EQE spectra of the devices.
