    , Accepted 24th May 2017First published on 24th May 2017AbstractThe phase conversions from YF3 to α-NaYF4, as well as α-NaYF4 to β-NaYF4 crystals, accompanied by morphology manipulation and upconversion (UC) luminescence enhancement have been demonstrated by simply increasing the Zn2+ ion doping concentration. We systematically discussed the influence of Zn2+ ion doping on the crystal phase and morphology of samples. Zn2+ ion occupies the Y3+ ion crystal lattice site leading to positive vacancy and lower energy barrier in the reaction of forming NaYF4. Besides, we also investigated the UC luminescence intensity enhancement of β-NaYF4:Yb/Er by Zn2+ ion doping. These results are expected to provide a new strategy for simultaneous phase control and remarkable UC luminescence enhancement of yttrium fluorides, which may be applicable for other fluorides.
1. Introduction
In recent years, lanthanide-doped nanocrystals have drawn considerable attention not only for their unique optical properties but also for their potential applications in the fields of in vivo imaging, solar cells and volumetric displays.1–7 Especially, YF3 nanocrystals and NaYF4 nanocrystals have been regarded as some of the best host lattices for performing UC luminescence, due to their good optical transparency, high chemical stability and low phonon energy.8–12 The applications of nanocrystals depend on various parameters, including morphology, size, and crystal phase. It has now become the research focus and the challenge of simultaneous control over size, shape, phase conversion and phase purity of crystals.13–18 Meanwhile, the UC emission intensity of lanthanide-doped YF3 nanocrystals and NaYF4 nanocrystals is also far from perfect for their practical application. Many methods have been devoted to controlling the crystal parameters and enhancing their UC luminescence intensity, such as different synthesis methods, altering reaction conditions and doping with different rare earth ions and metal elements.19–24
Due to the small ionic radius of some special ions, they can be doped easily into the host lattice of rare-earth-doped fluoride nanocrystals, which could break the symmetry of the parity forbidden intra-4f electronic transitions and alter the phase of NaYF4 nanocrystals to enhance UC luminescence intensity.25–29 Thus, many researches are devoted to the influence of ion doping (Li+, Ca2+, Mn2+, Cu2+, Fe3+, Mo3+ and some other ions) in NaYF4 nanocrystals.7,8,14,16,27,30 Liu's group reported simultaneous phase and size control of UC nanocrystals through lanthanide doping.30 Yin's group reported that UC luminescence intensity of NaYF4:Yb/Er nanocrystals was enhanced by Mo3+ doping and their application in bioimaging.31 Zhao's group reported Mn2+ dopant-controlled synthesis of NaYF4:Yb/Er UC nanoparticles for in vivo imaging and drug delivery.7 However, YF3:Yb/Er nanocrystals and NaYF4:Yb/Er nanocrystals co-doped with Zn2+ ion, remaining not fully predictable or understandable, provide a new approach to enhance UC luminescence intensity by adjusting the crystal field symmetry and crystalline phase.
Here, we synthesized precursors YF3 nanocrystals, a mixture of cubic and hexagonal phase NaYF4 nanocrystals and hexagonal NaYF4 microrods by adjusting the molar ratio of NaF to Ln(NO3)3 (F/Ln) for the same synthesis temperature and time. In our following experiments, the regular phase conversion from YF3 to α-NaYF4, then to β-NaYF4 can be obtained by Zn2+ ion doping. The transformations are not complete and the cubic phase is always present. The phase evolution process is systematically discussed in detail. The Zn2+ ion doping serves two purposes: (1) to tailor the local crystal field of the host lattice by replacing the Y3+ ion; (2) to reduce the energy barrier resulting in the phase conversion of NaYF4 crystals. In addition, the UC emission intensity enhancement was also observed in β-NaYF4:Yb/Er microrods by tuning the Zn2+ ion doping concentration.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Y(NO3)3·6H2O (99.999%), Yb(NO3)3·6H2O (99.999%), Er(NO3)3·6H2O (99.999%), Tm(NO3)3·6H2O (99.999%), and Zn(NO3)3·6H2O (99.999%) (purity > 99.99) were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) was supplied by Beijing Fine Chemical Company. All chemical reagents are of analytical grade and used directly without further purification.
2.2 Synthesis of the YF3 nanocrystals
The nanocrystals YF3: 20% Yb/2% Er/x mol% Zn (x = 0, 10, 20, 30, 40) were synthesized by a well-known hydrothermal method with EDTA as a surface modifier. Firstly, 0.28 g EDTA and 8 ml deionized water were mixed followed by 20 min stirring. Next, (0.78 − x) mmol Y(NO3)3·6H2O, ·0.2 mmol Yb(NO3)3·6H2O, 0.02 mmol Er(NO3)3·6H2O, x mmol Zn(NO3)3·6H2O (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) were added into the EDTA solution. After 20 min vigorous agitation, 5 mmol NaF dissolved in 10 ml deionized water was slowly added dropwise to the mixed solution followed by 1 h stirring. Then, the translucent solution was heated for 12 h (at about 180 °C) in a 30 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. Finally, the desired nanoparticles were obtained by high-speed centrifugation at room temperature, washed with ethanol several times and dried at 80 °C. The other samples were prepared by a similar procedure.
2.3 Characterization
In order to identify the sample crystallization phase, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out with a powder diffractometer (model Rigaku RU-200b), using Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The size and morphology of the samples were examined using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, Hitachi H-600) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM, KYKY1000B). A power-adjustable laser diode (980 nm, 0–2 W) was employed as the UC pump source. UC luminescence spectra were recorded with a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrometer with 1.0 nm spectral resolution (FWHM) and 400 V PMT voltage. The decay curves were obtained using a Triax 550 spectrometer (Jobin-Yvon) and recorded by a Tektronix digital oscilloscope (TDS 3052), while a 10 ns pulsed laser with tuneable wavelengths from an optical parametric oscillator pumped by a Nd:YAG laser (Spectra-Physics, GCR 130) was used as an excitation source.
3. Results and discussion
The YF3 and NaYF4 crystals were obtained by adjusting the molar ratio of Ln(NO)3 to NaF in the reaction solution. The XRD patterns of pure phase YF3 (F/Ln = 5), mixture of α-NaYF4 and β-NaYF4 (F/Ln = 6.5) and pure phase β-NaYF4 (F/Ln = 8) were obtained (see Fig. S1†), which indicate that the pure phase α-NaYF4 cannot be synthesized by adjusting the molar ratio of F/Ln at a temperature of 180 °C and heating for 12 h.

Fig. 1(a) shows the XRD patterns of YF3 (F/Ln = 5) nanocrystals doped with 20% Yb3+, 2% Er3+ and x mol% Zn2+ ions (x = 0, 10, 20, 30, 40). As shown, the XRD patterns of YF3: 20% Yb/2% Er/x mol% Zn (x = 0, 10) samples can be indexed to YF3 (JCPDS file number 70-1935). No other impurity peaks were detected, which revealed that pure YF3 had been fabricated. This indicates that a small amount of Zn2+ ion doping has no influence on the crystalline phase of the crystals. When the concentration of Zn2+ ion increased to 20 mol%, the transformation from YF3 to α-NaYF4 in these samples is evident. The pure cubic phase NaYF4 (matching well with the α-NaYF4 standard card JCPDS 6-342) was obtained as the Zn2+ ion concentration reached 30 mol%. In the presence of 40 mol% Zn2+ ion concentration, α-NaYF4 and β-NaYF4 (matching well with JCPDS 6-342 and JCPDS 16-334) are clearly shown. In the Raman spectra of YF3: 20% Yb/2% Er/x mol% Zn (x = 0, 10, 20, 30, 40) samples, the different peak positions of the YF3 and NaYF4 nanocrystals are shown in Fig. 1b.32 The YF3: 20% Yb/2% Er/20 mol% Zn nanocrystal also has two kinds of peak positions (the different diffraction peaks are marked with * and •, respectively), and this result is well complementary with the corresponding XRD data. Fig. 1c shows the EDX pattern of NaYF4: 20% Yb/2% Er/30 mol% Zn nanocrystals. As can be seen in Fig. 1c, almost all of the elements including Y, Yb, Zn, F, Na can be detected, confirming that the Zn2+ ions were successfully doped in the nanocrystals. A schematic diagram of the phase transformation in NaYF4 structure is shown in Fig. 1(d). With Zn2+ ion doping concentration increasing, the main lattice alters from YF3 to α-NaYF4, then to (α+β)-NaYF4.

Moreover, adopting the same experimental procedure, other ions, namely Mg, Zn, Cu, Mn, Fe and Li (their radius is smaller than that of Y3+ ion), were doped into YF3: 20% Yb/2% Er nanocrystals at a concentration of 40 mol% (F/Ln = 5). The phase structure of the samples is shown by the XRD patterns in Fig. 2. NaYF4 nanocrystal was obtained, implying that the nanocrystal phase evolution from YF3 to NaYF4 is similar to that of Zn2+ ion-doped nanocrystals, as mentioned above.
 Fig. 2  XRD patterns of YF3:Yb/Er nanocrystals after 40 mol% Xn (Xn = Mg, Zn, Cu, Mn, Fe, Li) ions were doped. 
For a thorough understanding of the effect of Zn2+ ion doping, we synthesized two kinds of samples: a mixture of α-NaYF4 and β-NaYF4 (F/Ln = 6.5) and pure phase β-NaYF4 (F/Ln = 8) by adjusting the ratio of F/Ln. With the doping concentration of the Zn2+ ion increasing, the characteristic (111) peak of α-NaYF4 appears weakened (see Fig. S2†). On the other hand, the XRD patterns of pure phase β-NaYF4 (F/Ln = 8) with different Zn2+ ion doping concentration remain constant, and no extra diffraction peaks were observed as shown in Fig. 3. On the basis of the XRD patterns, the crystal structure of the prepared sample was refined by the Rietveld refinement using the GSAS software program as shown in Fig. S3,† and the reliability of the Rietveld refinement is proven by the refinement parameters (Rp and Rwp) in Table S1.† It shows a small difference between the measured and refined XRD patterns. The lattice parameters (a and c) and the cell volume change with increasing content of Zn2+ ions. This result means that the Zn2+ ion is successfully doped into the host lattice by occupying the position of the Y3+ ion.
 Fig. 3  XRD patterns of β-NaYF4:Yb/Er (F/Ln = 8) nanocrystals co-doped with Zn2+ ions at various concentrations of 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 mol%. 
On the basis of the above experiment results, we learn that the doping concentration of Zn2+ ion in raw materials has great effects on the phases of YF3 and α-NaYF4 nanocrystals. The possible formation process of YF3 and NaYF4 nanocrystals was investigated. EDTA is an efficient chelator, which can react with Ln3+ to form Ln–EDTA complexes.33 The chemical reactions are expressed as follows:Y3+ − EDTA → Y − EDTAY − EDTA + 3F− → YF3 + EDTA
However, with Zn2+ ion doping into YF3 nanocrystals, the Zn2+ ion could occupy the Y3+ crystal lattice site. Positive vacancies are generated on the grain surface to balance the charge, forming transient electric dipoles with the positive poles pointing outward that greatly accelerate the diffusion of F− ions from the solution to the grain, in other words, extra F− ions could locate in the YF3 nucleus vicinity.34 In order to establish charge balance (coming from the substitution of Y3+ ion by heterovalent Zn2+ ion), the Na+ in the solution could enter the YF3 nucleus (see Fig. 4a). Moreover, previous reports have demonstrated that the size of the substitutional ion plays an important role in stabilizing a specific crystalline phase in fluoride-based hybrid materials. In our case, introducing Zn2+ ion (Zn2+: r = 1.04 Å) with a smaller size than Y3+ ion (Y3+: r = 1.159 Å) could dominate the formation of the YF3 nanocrystals. Compared with Y3+ ion, the smaller ionic radius of Zn2+ ion can reduce the energy barrier in the reaction of forming NaYF4. In this case, the variation of charge and energy barrier could cause the phase conversion from YF3 to α-NaYF4. Further, the result that β-NaYF4 appeared in the YF3: 20% Yb/2% Er/40 mol% Zn and the characteristic (111) peaks of α-NaYF4 decreased in the mixture of α-NaYF4 and β-NaYF4 (F/Ln = 6.5) occurs for the same reason. The findings are important not only for understanding the essence of the Zn2+-doping-mediated crystal growth process, but also for providing a convenient route for facile synthesis of pure cubic phase NaYF4 nanocrystals under higher reaction temperature and longer reaction time, which is different from the previous methods.
 Fig. 4  (a) Schematic illustration of the influence and related mechanism of Zn2+ ion doping in YF3 nanocrystals. (b) Scheme showing the possible Zn2+ ion doping positions in the β-NaYF4 crystal lattice. 
In the next experiment, the doping of Zn2+ ion in β-NaYF4 (F/Ln = 8) did not lead to the formation of other phases. However, shifting of the (201) peak can be observed due to Zn doping (see Fig. 3). In the β-NaYF4 host lattice, the smaller ionic radius of the Zn2+ ion (than that of the Y3+ ion) could enter the crystal site by substituting the Y3+ ion or interstitial sites or coexist in the two ways. The Y3+ ion is substituted by Zn2+ ion for a small amount of doping, resulting in the corresponding lattice constants slightly shrinking, a slightly smaller unit cell volume and a shorter interplanar distance (see Fig. 4b). The (201) position shifts toward a higher 2θ angle. Whereas, Zn2+ ion for a large amount of doping could occupy the interstitial sites, leading to the host lattice expansion, a larger unit cell volume and increasing the crystal spacing (see Fig. 4b). The (201) position shifts toward a lower 2θ angle. This result is similar to that for Mo3+ ion doping reported in the literature.31
Also, the morphologies of samples (YF3:Yb/Er/Zn, F/Ln = 5) were carefully investigated by adjusting the concentration of the Zn2+ ion. Fig. 5 exhibits the uniform size and morphology of samples via TEM images. The un-doped samples present an irregular shape in Fig. 5a. For a Zn2+ ion concentration of 10 mol%, the morphology of the sample retains a cubic form in Fig. 5b, and the average size is 400 nm. With the Zn2+ ion concentration increasing from 20% to 30% and 40%, the spherical morphology of the YF3/α-NaYF4, α-NaYF4 and α-NaYF4/β-NaYF4 samples remains basically unchanged, and the size of spherical morphology is about 300 nm (see Fig. 5c–e). The result clearly indicates that the morphological changes of YF3:Yb/Er/Zn nanocrystals are attributed to phase conversion. Contrary to the above results, there is no distinction for the morphology of β-NaYF4:Yb/Er/Zn (F/Ln = 8) samples after Zn2+ ion doping (see Fig. S4†). It clearly reveals that the microrods exhibit hexagonal structure, and the size of the microrods still remains at 2 μm.

Fig. 6a shows the UC luminescence spectra of the prepared YF3:Yb/Er/Zn nanocrystals with 980 nm excitation. The emission spectra display two green emission bands at 525 nm and 540 nm, and a red emission band at 652 nm, attributed to the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 electronic transitions, respectively. It can be concluded that the doping of the Zn2+ ion does not change the basic emission peaks of the Er3+ ion. Simultaneously, due to the phase conversion from YF3 to α-NaYF4 to β-NaYF4, the UC emission intensity was sharply enhanced. The inset of Fig. 6a shows the Zn2+ concentration dependence of the integral intensity around 525 nm and 652 nm. Under the same experimental conditions, the green and red emission intensities were about 4 and 9 times enhanced, respectively, for 40 mol% Zn2+ ion concentration compared to the emission intensity of Zn2+-free samples.
 Fig. 6  (a) UC spectra of YF3: 20% Yb/2% Er/x mol% Zn (x = 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40) nanocrystals with excitation of a 980 nm diode laser. (b) UC spectra of β-NaYF4: 20% Yb/2% Er/x mol% Zn (x = 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40) nanocrystals. The insets show the dependence of the enhancement factors of the green and red emissions on the concentration of Zn2+ ion. 
It can be seen from Fig. 6b that the UC emission intensity improvements of β-NaYF4:Yb/Er/Zn (F/Ln = 8) are similar to those of NaYF4:Yb/Er/Zn (F/Ln = 5) for 980 nm laser excitation. Three distinct bands in the range of 450–700 nm can be seen. Obviously, the highest intensities of the green (525 nm) and red (652 nm) emissions are observed at 20 mol% Zn2+ ion concentration, which are respectively 1.6 times and 1.7 times stronger than those of the Zn2+-free samples. As the doping concentration of Zn2+ ion becomes more than 20 mol%, the UC emission intensity is gradually reduced as shown in the inset of Fig. 6b.
There is a theory that could explain the NaYF4:Yb/Er/Zn (F/Ln = 8) UC luminescence enhancement phenomenon. When Zn2+ ions with different valence enter the crystal sites which are occupied by Y3+ ions, charge compensation will appear. The Kröger–Vink notation can usefully describe crystal defect formation. Assuming that the Zn2+ ion is incorporated in the yttrium site, fluoride vacancy defects can be expected with the following scheme:35  
where ZnY represents the Zn2+ ion, which substitutes the site of the Y3+ ion in the crystal lattice, VF represents the fluoride vacancy and FF represents fluoride in the crystal lattice (see Fig. S5†). As a combined effect of the existence of F− vacancies and the deviation of the ion radii, the lattice parameters of β-NaYF4 change. The result could prove that the symmetry around Yb/Er ion pairs has been reduced. A lower symmetry has been proven to be beneficial to improve the UC luminescence efficiency.13
We also measured the time behaviour of the 4S3/2 → 4I5/2 (540 nm) and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 (665 nm) transitions for the YF3: 20% Yb/2% Er/x mol% Zn (x = 0, 40, F/Ln = 5) and NaYF4: 20% Yb/2% Er/x mol% Zn (x = 0, 20, F/Ln = 8) nanocrystals. Fig. 7 shows the normalized decay profiles of 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 at 665 nm in the samples. The decay curves of samples are well fitted to a double exponential function (see the inset of Fig. 7): Fig. 7  Time evolutions of Zn2+-free and 20 mol% Zn2+-doped NaYF4:Yb/Er (F/Ln = 8) samples by monitoring the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition with excitation of a 10 ns pulsed laser at 980 nm. I(t) = I0 − A1exp(−t/τr) + A2exp(−t/τd)where A1 and A2 are the emission intensity factors, t is time, and τr and τd represent the rise and decay time of the transient for the exponential components. The τr depends mainly on the self-decay of levels. The τd is decided by the product of the Er3+ intermediate states and the decay functions of Yb3+:2F5/2. Moreover, the green and red emission lifetimes of YF3: 20% Yb/2% Er/40 mol% Zn samples and NaYF4: 20% Yb/2% Er/20 mol% Zn samples are longer than those of the Zn2+-free samples (see Table 1), respectively. This result indicates that the doping of Zn2+ ion could improve the luminescence intensity. After the substitution of Y3+ ion by Zn2+ ion, the phase conversion and the lattice slightly shrinking are beneficial for Yb3+–Er3+ and Er3+–Er3+ energy transfer, resulting in the enhancement of the UC luminescence intensity.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, YF3, α-NaYF4 and a mixture of (α+β)-NaYF4 samples were obtained by increasing Zn2+ ion doping concentration through a simple hydrothermal method. The influence of Zn2+ ion doping on the phase conversion and the UC emission intensity in YF3:Yb/Er was systematically investigated and discussed. The smaller Zn2+ ion radius compared with that of Y3+ ion can reduce the energy barrier in the reaction of forming crystals, which could cause the phase conversion from YF3 to α-NaYF4. Rarely reported in the literature, the β-NaYF4:Yb/Er nanocrystal appears when the Zn2+ ion doping content increases from 30 mol% to 40 mol%. Besides, the UC emission intensity of the β-NaYF4:Yb/Er nanocrystal can be significantly enhanced through Zn2+ ion doping. Our work provides a reference for phase control and UC emission enhancement of rare earth fluorides, which would have great potential in fields of photocatalysis, solar cells and sensors.
