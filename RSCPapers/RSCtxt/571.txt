    , Accepted 25th November 2020First published on 26th November 2020AbstractPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) represent a promising technology for highly efficient sunlight harvesting and its conversion to electricity at convenient costs. However, a few flaws of current devices undermine the long-term stability of PSCs. Some of them concern the interface between the photoactive perovskite and the hole transport layer (HTL), e.g. undesired charge recombination, polarization barriers and oxidation processes. A strategy to solve this problem is to replace the standard organic HTL (e.g. Spiro-OMeTAD) with a solid-state inorganic layer. Being extensively used in p-type dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), nickel oxide (NiO) has been the first choice as an inorganic HTL. Despite the great interests in the application of NiO and other p-type oxides in PSCs, there is no available atomistic model of their interface with a halide perovskite. Here, we address this knowledge gap via a thorough first-principles study of the prototypical PSC perovskite methyl-ammonium lead iodide (MAPI) and two inorganic p-type oxides: NiO and CuGaO2. This copper-gallium delafossite oxide is one of the most promising alternatives to NiO in p-type DSSCs, thanks to its wide optical bandgap and low valence band edge. Here, we characterize the properties of both isolated surface slabs and MAPI/HTL heterostructure models. Besides considering MAPI/NiO and MAPI/CuGaO2 interfaces from the pristine materials, we also address the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic p-type defects in both NiO (Ni vacancy, Ni vacancy with Li and Ag doping) and CuGaO2 (Cu vacancy) using more realistic models. Our study reveals the most convenient interfaces in terms of structural affinities and adhesion energies. From the electronic perspective, we present a detailed analysis on band edge alignments, with direct insights into the key functional parameters of PSCs: hole injection driving force and open circuit potential. Our data show how the presence of defects/dopants is crucial for a convenient hole injection in NiO and CuGaO2. These results provide new science-based design principles for further development of p-type oxides in PSC devices.

Introduction
Solar energy is the most abundant among renewable sources and its effective use can boost the transition towards a worldwide sustainable economic and social development.1 Photovoltaic (PV) technologies are capable of converting incident and diffuse sunlight directly into electricity, with overall conversion performances that depend on a subtle balance between the charge separation and transport processes across complex heterogeneous functional interfaces.2 The previous decade has seen the rise of Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs), an emerging PV technology that in a few years has achieved a remarkable sunlight-to-electricity conversion efficiency that is well above 20%.3 The key photoactive material in pioneer PSCs is methyl-ammonium lead iodide perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3, the so-called MAPI), which provides high absorbance in the visible range and a long carrier diffusion length4 and is cheap and easy to prepare. The perovskite structure with the general formula ABX3 allows for an easy tuning of structural and electronic features by combining different cations at the A site and anions at the X site. Most recent best performing PSCs employ MAPI derivatives where methyl-ammonium is partially substituted with formamidinium, Cs+ and Rb+, and iodine is partially substituted with Br− and Cl−.5 Regarding the B site, the lead cation cannot be replaced straightforwardly, but several efforts have been devoted to finding environmentally friendly non-toxic alternatives to Pb, such as Sn or Bi.6 MAPI (or its derivatives) is responsible for both sunlight adsorption and charge separation. The excited electron is then collected by the Electron Transport Layer (ETL), for example, TiO2 or other transparent n-type oxides,7 while, on the other side, the hole is collected by the Hole Transport Layer (HTL), which is typically a p-type organic film based on Spiro-OMeTAD.8 In the standard set-up, the ETL is in contact with a transparent conducting oxide (TCO) and the HTL with a metal electrode (n-i-p device).9 Recently, good conversion efficiencies have been also achieved by using PSCs in which the ETL and HTL are inverted (p-i-n set-up).10 Besides the photoactive MAPI, the chemical nature and morphology of the ETL and HTL materials are also crucial to achieve the highest performances. The key electronic features for the ETL and HTL are the band edge positions: the ETL conduction band (CB) should be lower in energy than the MAPI one, in order to allow for the injection of the photo-excited electron; the HTL valence band (VB) should be higher in energy than the MAPI one, to enable the jump of the hole to the HTL and, thus, the MAPI regeneration.11
Despite their excellent conversion efficiencies, PSCs are still far from reaching the commercial stage because of a few but severe flaws, mostly related to long-term stability.12 Many recent experimental studies have ascribed these weaknesses to the HTL and its interface with MAPI: one problem is related to the use of additives (lithium salts and tert-butyl pyridine) in the Spiro-MeOTAD layer that can lead to oxidative degradation.13 On the other hand, hole transport can be jeopardized by undesired processes at the interface (e.g., charge recombination, polarization barrier).14 To solve these problems, a recently proposed strategy is to replace the molecular-based HTL with a solid-state inorganic p-type transition metal oxide.15 To this end, in the inverted PSC approach, the most used material is NiO,16 an intrinsic p-type semiconducting oxide that has been extensively investigated, especially in the context of p-type dye sensitized solar cells17 and photocathodes for the hydrogen evolution reaction.18
Several experimental works have addressed inverted PSCs based on NiO as the HTL: the resulting incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies are very promising (PCE ∼ 20%), but several issues are still present and call for new solutions for more effective and long-standing inverted PSCs. Most of the limiting features of these devices are related to the well-known limitations of NiO (for example, charge trapping surface states, limited carrier mobility) and to the undesired interfacial processes (e.g., hysteresis) between the photoactive perovskite and NiO.19 Nickel oxide doping20 and interfacial engineering21 are two effective strategies that have resulted in devices with improved performances, but are still behind those of the less stable PSCs based on organic HTLs.
In this scenario, further developments of inverted PSCs can strongly benefit from understanding the fundamental electronic features at the interface between lead halide perovskite and the nickel oxide. However, despite great interest in inverted PSCs, there are no theoretical studies at the atomistic scale on such systems. Here, we report a thorough first-principles study on the MAPI-NiO interface based on the state-of-the-art spin-polarized Density Functional Theory (DFT) within the DFT+U and hybrid density functional frameworks.22 Building up from our experience in modeling p-type photocathodes,23 and from recent theoretical works on the interface between MAPI and n-type oxides,24 we present a model for addressing the structural and electronic features in heterojunctions made of MAPI and NiO, considering the pristine nickel oxide and NiO with p-type character. This character is achieved by modeling nickel vacancies, which are intrinsic defects in NiO. We have also considered Ni-defective NiO doped with two recently proposed species, namely Li+ and Ag+.25 We first address the isolated surface slab, considering the effects of the defects/dopants on the absolute position of the NiO valence band (VB) edges in comparison to MAPI. Then we focus on NiO/MAPI hetero-structures in order to assess the effects of mutual interactions on the structural (interfacial reconstruction, adhesion energies) and electronic features of the overall system, targeting the thermodynamic driving force for hole injection, i.e. the energy difference between the VB edges of NiO and MAPI, as an effective observable directly related to the PSC photo-conversion processes.26
Besides NiO, we also have investigated an alternative p-type oxide, the CuGaO2 delafossite oxide.27 This material has been recently proposed as an effective p-type transparent conducting oxide28 and several applications have used this material for p-type dye-sensitized solar cells.29,30 Only very few works have used CuGaO2 for PSCs,31 with very promising results. Here, we aim at assessing the structural interfacial features and the VB energy alignment between MAPI and this delafossite oxide, as an alternative to nickel oxide. Moreover, also in the case of CuGaO2, we address the effects of an intrinsic defect, i.e. the Cu vacancy that makes this material p-type, on the properties of both the surface slab and the MAPI/CuGaO2 heterojunction.32 From the analysis of our first-principles results, we provide a direct and consistent comparison between NiO and CuGaO2 for application as the HTL, thus deriving new insights that can promote further improvement of these materials for application in inverted PSC devices.
Results and discussion
The first step of our study is to compute the bulk minimum energy structures for the three materials of interest, MAPI, NiO and CuGaO2, including in the DFT-PBE(+U) approach the dispersion correction (Grimme's D3-BJ) term. Dispersion has been found to be relevant even in ionic crystals with Pb.33Fig. 1 depicts the minimum-energy bulk structures of these systems.
 Fig. 1  Minimum-energy structures for (a) the unit cell of orthorhombic MAPI, (b) the 2 × 2 × 2 supercell of rocksalt NiO and (c) the 3R CuGaO2 lattice in the hexagonal setting. The color labeling of atomic spheres is as follows: Pb – dark gray; I – violet; C – green; N – light blue; H – light pink; Ni – gray; O – red; Cu – blue; and Ga – light green. 
Regarding MAPI, we started our calculations from the low-temperature orthorhombic structure34 (Pnma group) with the MA molecules oriented as reported by Lee et al.35 and confirmed by neutron powder diffraction (NPD) results.36 Theoretically determined lattice constants at the PBE-D3BJ level of theory in this work (a = 8.844 Å, b = 12.592 Å, and c = 8.563 Å) are in good agreement with those determined using X-ray diffraction37 (a = 8.8362 Å, b = 12.5804 Å, and c = 8.5551 Å) and NPD (a = 8.8657 Å, b = 12.6293 Å, and c = 8.5769 Å).36 For this material, we have constructed a 7-layer slab of the (010) surface, which, together with the (101) surface, has been found in the XRD of planar MAPI heterojunctions and, thus, is believed to be a stable surface.38 Our model features flat PbI2-terminated layers in both sides of the slab. The choice of such a PbI2-rich system responds to two indications: first, several papers report the synthesis in excess PbI2 as one of the preferred techniques to improve the MAPI PCE performance.39,40 Second, DFT calculations have shown that the PbI2-terminated (010) surface has surface states just above the valence band, which can be beneficial for PSC performance as they can act as intermediates for hole transfer to adjacent HTLs by decreasing energy losses.41
Bulk NiO has been constructed as a 2 × 2 × 2 supercell of the 8-atom rock-salt unit cell for a total of 64 atoms. This supercell enables setting Ni spin-moments anti-ferromagnetically aligned along the (111) direction, as observed experimentally.42 The theoretically determined lattice constant at the PBE+U-D3BJ level of theory, scaled back to the unit cell, is atheo = 4.174 Å, which is in very good agreement with the experimental value of aexp = 4.18 Å.43 From the optimized bulk, we derived our HTL surface model that consists of a symmetric 7-layer slab of the NiO 2 × 2 × 2 supercell along the (001) direction for a total of 112 atoms. To model the p-type NiO surface slab, we introduced the nickel vacancy defect in the inner (central) layer of the slab. Moreover, we introduced two types of dopants, Li and Ag, on the surface top of the Ni-defective slab. In this way, we can evaluate the electronic and structural effects at the interface and the Ni vacancy and the dopant are as far as possible, avoiding artifacts for being neighbors in the inner layer.
Regarding the copper-gallium delafossite oxide, following previous works,28,44 we have considered the delafossite hexagonal phase for CuGaO2. The lattice constants calculated at the PBE+U-D3BJ level of theory are a = b = 2.959 Å and c = 17.541 Å, which deviate <2% from the experimental values (a = b = 2.97 Å, c = 17.17 Å).45–47 For surface and interface calculations, we have considered the (012) surface, since it has been identified among the preferred facets of delafossite crystals48,49 and has the lowest calculated surface energy in CuGaO2.28 For electronic structure calculations and for constructing the MAPI/CuGaO2 interface, CuGaO2 HTL has been represented as a 5-trilayer (012) slab with (3 × 3) periodicity in the xy plane. p-Type CuGaO2 has been modeled by removing one Cu atom from the central layer.28 The structures of all these surface slabs are depicted in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 2  Minimum-energy structures of the investigated surface slab models: photoactive perovskite (a) (MAPI); copper gallium delafossite oxide as (b) a pristine slab (CuGaO2) and (c) with a Cu vacancy in the central inner layer (CuGaO2:VCu); nickel oxide as (d) a pristine slab (NiO), (e) with a Ni vacancy in the central inner layer (NiO:VNi), (f) with a Ni vacancy in the central inner layer and the Li dopant at the surface top layer (NiO:VNi:Li) and (g) with a Ni vacancy in the central inner layer and the Ag dopant at the surface top layer (NiO:VNi:Ag). The color legend is the same as in Fig. 1 plus Li – yellow and Ag – orange. 
The presence of defects/dopants is able to provide the well-known p-type character to the NiO and CuGaO2 oxides as shown from the PDOS of each system (see Fig. S1–S4 in the ESI†).
Regarding NiO, besides the nickel vacancy, we tested the doping with Li and Ag in the Ni-defective slabs. According to Shannon's ionic radii,50 Li+ is only slightly larger than Ni2+ (0.76 vs. 0.69 Å, respectively). For this reason it does not generate significant surface reconstruction. The Ag+ cation (1.15 Å), instead, is much larger than nickel so it tends to release the steric stress by moving outwards from the surface (see Fig. 2g).
The computed absolute valence band (VB) edge positions from these optimized surface slab models are depicted in Fig. 3. The energy difference between the VB of MAPI and the VB of the HTL represents a first estimate of the driving force for hole transport, a key step in the photo-current conversion process. This driving force ΔEh-inj defined as (VBHTL − VBMAPI) should be positive to be convenient and high enough to drive the hole jump from MAPI. Yet, VBHTL is also involved in the PSC open circuit potential, together with the conduction band of the ETL (VOC = CBETL − VBHTL). Since VOC is the maximum theoretical potential that can be attained by the cell, a too high energy of the VBHTL position would provide a good hole transport driving force, but a low power output.
 Fig. 3  Absolute VB edge positions of NiO- and CuGaO2-based HTL oxides in comparison to that of MAPI computed at the PBE+U level of theory. 
From these data, obtained on isolated surface slabs, it appears that neither pristine NiO nor pristine CuGaO2 would be a convenient HTL because their VBs lie below that of MAPI, thus impeding the hole injection. While in CuGaO2 there is no significant improvement when considering the Cu vacancy, the presence of a Ni vacancy and dopants helps in lifting up NiO VB in energy, thus providing a sufficient driving force for the hole jump from MAPI to the HTL.
We must note here that the error when absolute VB positions are calculated in this way is about 0.2–0.4 eV. Indeed, the experimental VB edge of MAPI is −5.4 eV51 while that computed at the PBE level of theory is ∼−5.7 eV. This error can be significant since the desired differences for an effective hole injection are in the order of ∼0.2 eV. The use of HSE for computing the absolute band edge position does not guarantee improved results, with the HSE predicted VB edge position for MAPI being −5.9 eV.
We must note here that we aim at qualitative insights rather than quantitative prediction that would require an improved account of electronic correlation with perturbative approaches (e.g. GW) and of spin–orbit coupling, which have important implications on the electronic and optical properties of hybrid perovskites involving heavy atoms such as Pb.52 Indeed, GW together with explicit SOC treatment has been applied to the bulk MAPI perovskite, yielding bandgap values that are in very good agreement with those from experiments.53 However, this combination cannot be used for calculating bandgap edges since GW is a much more expensive method than DFT and, to date, is not feasible for large slabs/heterojunction systems like ours. When SOC is applied to DFT calculations instead, the deviation from the experimental values is noticeable. The SOC shifts the lead states downwards at the bottom of the conduction band and does not modify substantially the valence band top iodine states with respect to the plain DFT calculation (Fig. S5, ESI†), resulting in a too low bandgap center and in a too low MAPI absolute valence band position, even further from the experimental value than the DFT result. Actually, from our calculations, the MAPI valence band shifts to ∼−5.9 V when considering SOC. Besides this practical disagreement when including SOC, the use of plain DFT for calculating band edge positions is theoretically justified by the Perdew and Levy's proof of Janak's theorem for non-metals,54 which shows that the bandgap center is predicted exactly by the Kohn–Sham band structure. For these reasons, we neglect SOC in the calculation of the electronic properties all through our work.
A more complete approach, never explored before for this kind of system, is to consider the hetero-structure formed by MAPI and the HTL materials. The two kinds of MAPI/HTL junctions under study in this work have been constructed from the slabs described above taking into account the following geometry considerations: first, a 1 × 1 lateral slab (of the 2 × 2 supercell) of NiO (001) matches with the 1 × 1 lateral slab of the MAPI (010) surface, while a 3 × 3 supercell of CuGaO2 is a good match for a 1 × 2 supercell of MAPI. Second, since inverted configurations of PSC are HTL-supported, we have fixed the lattice constants of the heterojunction to those of NiO and CuGaO2.

Fig. 4 depicts the resulting interfaces for intrinsic p-type NiO and CuGaO2 after relaxation, while those from the pristine and p-type doped systems are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†).

For each system, the total heterojunction slab model and the magnification of the interface region are shown in the left and right panels, respectively. The color legend is the same as in Fig. 1. 
The interaction energy between the two components has been computed by the energy difference between the energy of the heterostructure and those of the constituent surface slab, divided by the interface area (S). ΔEint values obtained in this way, together with the selected interfacial structural parameters, are listed in Table 1.

From the energy values reported in Table 1, only perfect NiO would have a strong affinity with MAPI, while pristine CuGaO2 and p-type derivatives of both materials would have less convenient adhesion energies, but still negative, indicating that all kinds of junctions explored are, in principle, possible. Regarding the interface distances, CuGaO2 is closer to MAPI than NiO in their junctions by ∼0.5 Å, in both the pristine and intrinsic p-type cases. The presence of dopants strengthens the MAPI/NiO-based HTL interaction with both more negative adhesion energies and the two materials being closer. Although both kinds of doping decrease the NiO-MAPI distance, the dopants themselves behave in opposite ways: Li moves towards the p-NiO slab (d Li-MAPI = 2.71 Å), while Ag towards the MAPI layer (d Ag-MAPI = 1.99 Å).
MAPI undergoes different structural changes when in contact with NiO or CuGaO2, as can be seen with the naked eye in Fig. 4 and as quantified by the Pb–I distances and I–Pb–I angles shown in Table 1. On top of NiO in the inverted configuration, MAPI suffers an elongation of +0.6 and 2.5% along the a and c axes, respectively. As a result, MAPI increases its cubicity with respect to the tetragonal isolated slab: Pb–I distances lie in a narrower range, I–Pb–I angles are all close to 90 degrees and the PbI6 tilting is partially quenched. Very differently, MAPI undergoes compression when in contact with CuGaO2; as this effect is not uniform: the compression along the a axis is negligible (< −0.1%), while it is quite significant along the c axis (∼ −6%). As a result, the MAPI PbI5 interface moieties are distorted further from the orthorhombic structure, with Pb–I bonds as long as 3.71 Å and I–Pb–I angles significantly far from 90 degrees. This result suggests a strong point of NiO-based heterojunctions since the cubic and tetragonal MAPI phases have been shown to outperform the orthorhombic one in terms of short circuit current and fill factor values.55 Moreover, it has been shown that the temperature-dependent increase of cubicity from tetragonal to cubic entails a less dramatic improvement of MAPI photovoltaic performance than expected due to the temperature-induced instantaneous distortions at the sub-picosecond scale arising from the motion of the MA cations and to the fluctuations of the inorganic sublattice.56 Since this strain-induced cubicity increase is not dependent on temperature, this effect should be minimized.
Besides these structural modifications, the mutual polarization of the constituent materials leads to new electronic structures in these hetero-structures, which present some differences from those of the isolated systems discussed above. Fig. 5 shows the projected density of states (PDOS) plots for MAPI/NiO-based heterojunctions.
 Fig. 5  PDOS plots computed at the PBE+U level of theory on MAPI/NiO-based heterostructures. 
From these plots, it is clearly observed that pristine NiO is unable to accept holes from MAPI because the VB of the perovskite still lies at a higher energy than the NiO one. When considering the Ni vacancy alone (NiO:VNi), we find that the now p-type NiO has its VB edge well above the MAPI VB, as desired. Both Li+ and Ag+ dopants jeopardize the effect of the Ni vacancy; we find that the VB edge of MAPI overlaps the VB of the doped oxide at the Fermi level. This means that the hole has no driving force to move to the HTL, thus favoring unwanted charge recombination events. This result is qualitatively similar to the one obtained from the comparison of absolute VB positions computed for the isolated components only for NiO and NiO:VNi but was not predicted for either NiO:VNi:Li or NiO:VNi:Ag.
We have performed an analogous analysis on MAPI/CuGaO2 heterostructures, the PDOS of which are depicted in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  PDOS plots computed at the PBE+U level of theory on MAPI/CuGaO2-based heterostructures. 
The need for a more realistic system like the heterojunction is made evident again by these PDOS, which substantially differ from those obtained with the isolated components. While in computed VB edges for isolated surface slabs the CuGaO2 one lies below the MAPI one (meaning inconvenient hole injection), the CuGaO2 VB shifts to higher energy than the MAPI one when the heterojunction model is considered, making CuGaO2 a potentially good candidate to accept holes from the photoexcited MAPI. The presence of the copper vacancy does not impact much the VB edge features, improving slightly the hole injection driving force. However, intra-gap states appear, which can promote the undesired charge recombination process.

Table 2 presents the final hole injection driving force values, as derived from the heterojunction electronic structures (PDOS, Fig. 5 and 6) in comparison to those obtained from isolated surface slabs (VB evaluation, Fig. 3). The highlights and magnification of the PDOS sections across the Fermi level used to obtain these ΔE values are reported in the ESI† (Fig. S7 and S8).

The computed data provide a clear indication that the p-NiO and p-CuGaO2 systems would be able to accept hole transfer from MAPI with driving forces ΔEh-inj of ∼0.1/0.2 eV, which can enable hole transport without compromising the open circuit potential. Recent PES measurements in real cells featuring the MAPI/NiO interface have determined a ΔEh-inj of 0.09 eV,57 which is very close to, and of the same order of magnitude as, our computed value for the MAPI/NiO:VNi interface (0.18 eV). Thus, we are confident that our models are qualitatively correct for all the systems under study.
In order to gain more insights into the interface contribution to the electronic structure of the heterojunctions, we calculated the layer-resolved PDOS (LRPDOS) for all the heterostructures under study (Fig. 7 and 9). In all plots, eight layers are represented, corresponding to the four layers of each material closest to the interface, as labeled in Fig. 4. All layers beyond those do not feel the presence of the second material and present a converged DOS with respect to the fourth layer, so we have not included them in the plots for the ease of viewing.

The LRPDOS of the MAPI/NiO:VNi heterostructure is plotted in Fig. 7a and compared side by side with the LRPDOS of the two separate materials (Fig. 7b). By comparing the two plots it is possible to see that the behavior of the two materials at the interface is essentially the same as that of the corresponding slab models. The most significant features are a slight decrease of the bandgap at 1L-NiO on the heterojunction with respect to isolated NiO and the mid-gap empty states appearing at NiO interface inner layers (4L-NiO), also present in isolated NiO, which are localized states corresponding to the Ni vacancy in this layer.
Analogously, the LRPDOS of the MAPI/CuGaO2:VCu heterostructure surface is shown in Fig. 7c in comparison to that of MAPI and CuGaO2:VCu separated systems (Fig. 7d). Contrary to what was discussed above for MAPI/NiO–VNi, the LRPDOS of the heterojunction is significantly different from that of the separated surfaces. The first remarkable feature is the shift of the CuGaO2 VB edge above the MAPI VB, delivering the desired non-zero driving force for hole injection. Moreover, brand new states appear in the 1L and 2L of CuGaO2 and in the 1L of MAPI in the heterojunction. CuGaO2 preserves its lattice constants from the isolated slab in the heterojunction, so such states must have an electronic origin. MAPI, instead, is constrained to the HTM lattice constants in the heterojunction so the state present in the 1L could not only be electronically induced but also respond to such structural modification. In order to decouple these two effects for MAPI, we have computed the LRPDOS for the MAPI isolated surface at the lattice constants and geometry distortion present in the heterojunction. This LRPDOS, shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), shows that the state in 1L-MAPI is not present in this system either, ruling out structurally-induced changes.
In order to achieve a better understanding of the undergoing electronic changes at the MAPI/CuGaO2:VCu interface, we have prepared electron density difference plots at the MAPI/CuGaO2:VCu interface with respect to the isolated surfaces at the heterojunction geometry, which are plotted in Fig. 8a.
 Fig. 8  Electron density differences for the interaction between HTLs (a) CuGaO2:VNi and (b) NiO:VNi with MAPI. Yellow color denotes increased electronic density and light blue denotes decreased electronic density. Isosurface value: 0.05 e−/Ang3. 
From this plot, a region of increased density at the interface can be ascribed to Ga–I newly formed bonds. In fact, as described above, the two materials are closer together for the CuGaO2-based interface. Such strong interaction between the two materials brings about all-new electronic interface features on both constituents with respect to the isolated materials, as shown by the LRPDOS (Fig. 7c and d). No new bonds can be identified across the MAI/NiO-VNi interface but only a slight reorganization of the electronic density within 1L-NiO and 1L-MAPI (Fig. 8b), in agreement with the little changes in LRPDOS reported for MAI/NiO-VNi with respect to the isolated materials (Fig. 7a and b). The new Ga–I bonds appear likely, thanks to a more favorable surface pattern, because the Ga–I bonding is stronger than Ni–I.58
Regarding MAPI/NiO:VNi:Li and MAPI/NiO:VNi:Ag, their LRPDOS are plotted in Fig. 9a and c, respectively, together with the LRPDOS of the corresponding isolated slabs (Fig. 9b and d).
In these cases, the presence of a p-type inducing species at the surface of NiO changes the interface properties. As both dopants behave in a similar way, we discuss them jointly in the following. In the NiO doped slab, besides the nickel vacancy empty state at the inner layer, a new state appears in the 1L due to the presence of the dopant, which contributes with a second hole. Upon the formation of the interface, the surface hole is partially transferred to the MAPI 1L and delocalized all over the NiO surface layer. As a result, both Pb p and O p states cross the Fermi level, and the driving force for hole injection becomes zero.
These findings pave the route to investigate more complex mechanisms occurring after doping like for example the formation of oxygen vacancies as a further defect compensation effect for p-type doping.59,60
Conclusions
In this work, we have addressed for the first time the electronic structure of the interface between the prototypical photoactive perovskite MAPI and p-type semiconducting oxides, NiO and CuGaO2, as a possible HTL in inverted PSCs. Our first aim has been to address the effects of defects/dopants on the absolute valence band edge of the oxides and compare them to that of the MAPI one. We applied a well-established approach to define the VB band edge based on vacuum energy level and work function, computed for each isolated slab, together with the best available estimate of band gaps. The energy difference between VBMAPI and VBNiO/CuGaO2 defines the hole-injection driving force, an important parameter to define the suitability of a material as the HTL for PSC devices.
For pristine NiO, we predict the VB maximum at −5.86 eV, close to other similarly computed values (e.g. −5.88 eV61) and slightly off with respect to the available experimental values (−4.8/−5.5 eV).62 We attained the same level of accuracy for MAPI (predicted value: −5.73 eV vs. experimental value: ∼−5.4 eV), and considering our error to be systematic, we can conclude that the pristine NiO VB maximum is lower in energy than the MAPI one, thus impeding an effective hole transport. The presence of defects (Ni vacancy) together with dopants (Li and Ag cations) is in general positive because they push up in energy the NiO VB edge, allowing a favorable thermodynamic driving force for the hole injection from the MAPI VB maximum.
Regarding CuGaO2 delafossite, its VB edge is lower in energy than VBMAPI, so effective hole injection is hindered. This result is in line with a recent work where we found the VB maximum of CuGaO2 to be lower than that of the VB edge of NiO.28 The presence of the defect (Cu vacancy) provides the desired p-type character to the delafossite oxide, but it is not sufficient to shift the VB edge to energies higher than that of the MAPI VB. Thus, according to the isolated slab approach, CuGaO2 would not be a good HTL for PSCs based on MAPI.
In order to assess the mutual polarization effect, we also investigated the heterojunction between MAPI and the two oxides. We found negative interaction energies between MAPI and both CuGaO2 and NiO systems, meaning that all the investigated interfaces are actually possible and thermodynamically stable.
From the perspective of interfacial electronic features, the analysis of the projected density of states of the heterostructures allowed us to evaluate the hole injection driving forces when the two systems form a junction. In the case of NiO, the results from the heterostructure confirm the qualitative picture obtained by the isolated slab only for the pristine NiO and NiO:VNi cases. The layer resolved PDOS calculated for p-type NiO reveals that the agreement between the results predicted by the two different models occurs since interface formation does not modify the behavior of the single heterostructure components. The computed ΔEh-inj values of 0.07 eV (for the isolated slab) and 0.18 eV (for the heterojunction) are in good agreement with the recently measured experimental value of ∼0.09 eV for the MAPI/NiO junction.57
Regarding the models involving both a nickel vacancy and dopants, we first found that they allow for an improvement over pristine NiO, providing a sufficient hole extraction in the separate slab model. However, by considering the more realistic model involving heterostructures, we can see that the interface formation modifies the electronic properties of the single compounds, changing the alignment of their VB edges and lowering the driving force for hole injection to zero.
For distinct reasons, the results obtained for MAPI/CuGaO2 from the junction models reveal also a different picture than the one obtained from the isolated slabs. In this heterostructure, the relative position of VBCuGaO2 and VBMAPI is indeed favorable for the hole-injection process. The origin of this behavior can be attributed to interfacial structural and electronic reorganization. The formation of Ga–I bonds and the subsequent rearrangements of the electronic structure allow the favourable positioning of MAPI and CuGaO2 VB edges for an effective hole injection. These results point out that copper–gallium delafossite oxide can act as a potentially successful HTL in PSCs, in agreement with recent experimental works that have explored this research direction.27,31 We must note that the midgap states appearing at such interface could trigger undesired recombination processes and then the efficiencies of MAPI/CuGaO2-based PSCs could then be lower than expected.63,64 Strategies underway to solve this common issue include the passivation of the interface.63,65 This aspect and the complete charge transfer mechanism across the interface will be the object of future studies.
In conclusion, this work presents the first set of results for the structural, energetic and electronic features of MAPI/HTL–oxide interfaces and provides new insights into the effect of Li and Ag doping as well as the application of delafossite oxides as the HTL. Our ongoing and future work will build up on these results for further characterizing the effects of additives at MAPI/NiO and MAPI/CuGaO2 interfaces and in fine-tuning the methodological machinery for allowing a fast and reliable prediction of the electronic structures and charge transfer kinetic parameters of these large systems.
Methods and computational details
We have performed periodic spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations with projector-augmented wave (PAW) potentials66,67 and a plane wave (PW) basis set by using the Vienna ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP, version 5.4.4).68–71 As the exchange–correlation functional, we have used the approximation of Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE).72,73 For NiO- and CuGaO2-related systems, we have applied the DFT+U approach of Dudarev74 as implemented in the VASP75 in order to describe strongly correlated Ni, Cu and Ag d electrons. This approach is well suited for a great variety of transition metal oxides.17,76,77 Following previous works on NiO23,78 and Cu(I)-containing oxides,28,44,79,80 we have used U–J values of 3.8 and 6.0 eV for Ni and Cu, respectively. We have used a U–J value of 6.0 eV for Ag also, since it belongs to the same group as Cu and has an analogous d shell electronic occupation. Dispersion has been considered within Grimme's D3 framework81 with the damping scheme by Becke and Johnson82,83 (D3BJ). Electronic structures have been refined by performing single-point calculations with the hybrid functional HSE06 by Heyd, Scuseria and Ernzerhof84,85 at the PBE(+U)-D3BJ optimized geometries. We have set a SCF energy threshold of 10−5 eV and a total force threshold of 0.03 eV·Å−1 for geometry optimization purposes. The plane wave energy cutoff has been set to 600 eV in all calculations. Γ-Centered k-point sampling grids of 4 × 3 × 4, 4 × 4 × 4 and 8 × 8 × 2 have been used for orthorhombic MAPI, cubic NiO and hexagonal CuGaO2 bulk materials, respectively. With these numerical parameters, the convergence of total energies within 5 meV per formula unit is achieved. k-Point sampling for the surface slabs and heterojunctions has been scaled accordingly. All atoms of bulks, surface slabs and heterojunctions have been allowed to relax without either freezing coordinates or imposing symmetry during geometry optimizations. In slab and heterojunction calculations, a vacuum layer of ∼13 Å has been used in order to avoid any interaction between images. For each slab system, we computed the work-function and vacuum energy levels, in order to define the absolute position of the valence band (VB) edge according to the approach originally proposed by Toroker et al.61 For this purpose, we have considered the best theoretical estimates of the bandgap for MAPI (1.6 eV),53 NiO (3.6 eV)61 and CuGaO2 (2.2 eV).86 For systems with defects or dopants where the band-gap center is ill-defined, we have evaluated their absolute VB positions by considering the shift with respect to the pristine system to be consistent with the shift in the computed work-function.

	ABMG is Assistant Professor of Physical Chemistry at the Department of Physics in the University of Naples Federico II (UniNA, Italy). After her PhD in Theoretical Chemistry from the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (2011, Spain) and postdoctoral fellowship with Prof. Emily A. Carter at Princeton University (2011–2012, USA), she was appointed as Junior Research Professor at the Department of Chemical Sciences (UniNA, 2012–2017). Since 2018, after obtaining the National Scientific Habilitation as Associate Professor, she started her independent group at the Department of Physics. Her research focuses on the first-principles modeling and the design of heterogeneous functional materials for energy conversion technologies.

 	Fig. 1  Minimum-energy structures for (a) the unit cell of orthorhombic MAPI, (b) the 2 × 2 × 2 supercell of rocksalt NiO and (c) the 3R CuGaO2 lattice in the hexagonal setting. The color labeling of atomic spheres is as follows: Pb – dark gray; I – violet; C – green; N – light blue; H – light pink; Ni – gray; O – red; Cu – blue; and Ga – light green.	 

 	Fig. 2  Minimum-energy structures of the investigated surface slab models: photoactive perovskite (a) (MAPI); copper gallium delafossite oxide as (b) a pristine slab (CuGaO2) and (c) with a Cu vacancy in the central inner layer (CuGaO2:VCu); nickel oxide as (d) a pristine slab (NiO), (e) with a Ni vacancy in the central inner layer (NiO:VNi), (f) with a Ni vacancy in the central inner layer and the Li dopant at the surface top layer (NiO:VNi:Li) and (g) with a Ni vacancy in the central inner layer and the Ag dopant at the surface top layer (NiO:VNi:Ag). The color legend is the same as in Fig. 1 plus Li – yellow and Ag – orange.	 

 	Fig. 3  Absolute VB edge positions of NiO- and CuGaO2-based HTL oxides in comparison to that of MAPI computed at the PBE+U level of theory.	 

 	Fig. 4  Minimum-energy structures of MAPI/HTL interfaces with intrinsic p-type (a) NiO and (b) CuGaO2. For each system, the total heterojunction slab model and the magnification of the interface region are shown in the left and right panels, respectively. The color legend is the same as in Fig. 1.
