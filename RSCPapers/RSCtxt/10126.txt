    , Accepted 25th September 2022First published on 26th September 2022AbstractHigh-density pores formed on Si are effective for enhancing the light absorption of Si, thereby improving the efficiency of graphene (GR)/Si-heterojunction optoelectronic devices. Insulating hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is highly attractive as an interfacial material between GR and semiconducting materials for heterostructures because of the large bandgap/small lattice mismatch with GR. Here, we first report the bifunctional enhancement of photodetection and photovoltaic parameters in (trifluoromethanesulfonyl)-amide-doped GR (TFSA-GR)/porous Si (PSi)/Si heterostructures by employing a h-BN interlayer at the TFSA-GR/PSi interface and a bathocuproine (BCP) passivation layer on the Si back surface. The concurrent use of h-BN and BCP layers makes it difficult for the electrons to overcome the energy barriers as well as for the photo-induced electrons/holes to be recombined at the interfaces, thereby decreasing the dark current (DC) and facilitating the photocarrier collection, respectively. These effects result in remarkable improvements of the photoresponse and energy harvesting. In particular, the specific detectivity is almost 100 times enhanced at zero bias, i.e., under self-powered. The devices also show excellent long-term stability by maintaining 98 and 74% of their original photocurrent and DC, respectively, when kept in air for 2000 h. These results suggest that TFSA-GR/h-BN/PSi/Si/BCP heterostructures are very promising for application in self-powered or self-driving multifunctional optoelectronic devices.
1. Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) layered materials such as graphene (GR), hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), and their heterostructures have recently received intensive attention due to their unique properties and possible device applications.1–5 GR is a promising material as a transparent conductive electrode (TCE) for optoelectronic devices in view of its high electrical conductivity and almost-perfect transmittance in the visible region.6,7 Insulating h-BN is highly attractive as an interfacial material between GR and semiconducting materials for heterostructures because the bandgap of h-BN is very large and its lattice mismatch with GR is very small (1.5%).8 A lot of studies have been performed on Schottky junctions formed at the GR TCE/Si interface for improving the performance of Si-based optoelectronic devices such as photodetectors (PDs) and solar cells.9–14 An external voltage is usually supplied for the operation of PDs, thereby inducing the separation of the generated electron–hole pairs. By including the power source, large packaging of the entire device with the operating circuit is required. Therefore, it is of great interest to the research community to determine how to self-operate PDs without an external power source, i.e., in “self-powered” mode. The performance of self-powered PDs is usually evaluated at zero bias. Among the figures of merit for characterizing PDs, specific detectivity (D*) is one of the most important parameters, indicating how weak the signals PDs can detect are. Compared to bulk Si, nanostructured porous Si (PSi) exhibits not only a high absorption coefficient in the visible range but also a fast response (∼3 μs) in the PSi-based PD structure, originating from the large energy bandgap and low dimensionality, respectively, as previously reported in the literature.15
Recently, low-dimensional insulating or semiconducting materials have been inserted between GR and Si as an approach to effectively separate electrons and holes, thereby improving the figures of merit of the GR/Si-junction-based optoelectronic devices.16–22 Interlayers located at the interfaces of the GR/Si as well as of the Si/rear electrode greatly reduced the dark current (DC). As a result, the photoresponsivity and D* were improved, but the response speed was still relatively slow. It is expected that such an interlayer is also effective for improving the performance of the GR/PSi heterojunction. Among various kinds of 2D materials, h-BN can be a promising candidate for such an interlayer, as shown in its various combinations with principal low-dimensional materials.17 As another approach, for enhancing the power conversion efficiency of Si-based solar cells, a back passivation layer that can block the carrier recombination at the Si back surface has been widely used.22–24 Bathocuproine (BCP) is well known as a passivation material for blocking holes as well as for smoothening the movement of electrons at the back surface in organic solar cells.25,26 Similar effects are also expected for Si-based optoelectronic devices by the use of BCP at the Si back surface. In this work, we for the first time report the bifunctional properties of photodetection and photovoltaics based on a (trifluoromethanesulfonyl)-amide-doped GR (TFSA-GR)/h-BN/PSi/Si/BCP heterostructure. We systematically evaluated the photodetection and photovoltaic parameters with/without h-BN and/or BCP. Finally, we monitored the photocurrent (PC) and DC for 2000 h in air to check the long-term stability of the PDs.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Fabrication of graphene/boron nitride/porous Si/Si/bathocuproine heterostructures
Au nanoparticles (NPs) were first deposited on n-Si by metal sputtering for 5 s. Pores were randomly formed on the Si surface by immersing the Au NPs/n-Si stack in a mixed etchant of HF and H2O2 ([HF]:[H2O2] = [1]:[1]) for 5 s. PSi was finally prepared by completely removing the Au NPs with aqua regia. The systematic processes of the preparation are described in detail in previous studies.15,27,28 Insulating h-BN sheets uniformly grown on Cu foil substrates by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) were purchased from Six Carbon Technology, and then coated with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) solution (0.46 g PMMA powder/10 mL chlorobenzene). The PMMA/h-BN/Cu foil stack was suspended in a 1 M FeCl3 solution bath to etch the Cu foil away. The remaining PMMA/h-BN stack was washed several times in a deionized water bath to remove the residual impurities and transferred to the PSi surface. Then, the sample was cured on a hot plate at 100 °C for 2 h, and the PMMA layer was removed with acetone. Single-layer GR was grown on Cu foil by CVD at 1000 °C for 1 h, and transferred onto the h-BN by a similar transfer process [28] to finally complete the PD structure. The TFSA solution was dropped/spin-coated on the entire GR surface at 2500 rpm for 1 min, and the TFSA-GR/h-BN/PSi/Si stack was then heat-treated at 100 °C for 1 min. Finally, BCP dissolved in isopropyl alcohol (0.5 mg mL−1) was spin-coated on the back of the Si wafer at 1500 rpm for 40 s.
2.2 Characterization
Plan-view images of PSi were obtained using a field-effect scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Carl Zeiss model LEO SUPRA 55). Surface roughness (Rq) and thickness (t) of the h-BN films were measured by non-contact mode atomic force microscopy (AFM, Park System, model XE-100). The Raman-scattering properties of PSi, h-BN, and GR were analyzed using a Raman spectrometer system with a 532 nm laser line (model HEDA, NOST in Korea). The transmittance of h-BN and TFSA-GR on a quartz substrate was measured using an ultraviolet (UV)-visible near-infrared spectrometer (Agilent Varian, model Carry 5000). The sheet resistance and work function of the TFSA-GR were measured using a 4-probe method (Dasol eng, model FPP-HS8-40K) and a Kelvin probe force microscope (Park System model XE-100), respectively. The electrical behaviors of the devices were determined using a Keithley 2400 source meter under illumination at 600 nm laser. The rise/fall time of the photoresponse was recorded using a 532 nm pulse laser with a frequency (f) of 10 kHz. The DC noise of the device was measured using a current preamplifier (Stanford Research Systems, model SR570) and a dynamic signal analyzer (Agilent, model 35670A) in the dark. Photovoltaic parameters of the cells were extracted from a solar simulator (McScinece, model K201) with stable 100 mW cm−2 illumination.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a and b) show the schematic diagrams for the structure and energy band of a typical TFSA-GR/h-BN/PSi/Si/BCP/InGa heterostructure, respectively (for the real image, see Fig. S1, ESI†). As shown in the SEM image (Fig. S2a, ESI†), high-density pores were randomly distributed on the PSi surface. The pore sizes were distributed in the range of 14–25 nm, with an average size of 16.5 nm. The pore density of the PSi was estimated to be 76.3%. Compared to planar Si, the Raman spectrum of the PSi was broader (full width at half maximum: 14 → 32 cm−1) and shifted by about 7 cm−1 (520 → 513 cm−1), suggesting that the PSi was well formed (Fig. S2b, ESI†).15,28 By formation of the PSi, the reflectance was sharply reduced in the 300–1000 nm wavelength (λ) range, with the maximum decrease being 40% at λ = 300 nm (Fig. S2c, ESI†). The h-BN layer was identified by observing the E2g Raman peak,17,29 and the thickness of the h-BN was measured to be about 3.5 nm by AFM (∼10 layers) (Fig. S3a, ESI†).30 From the transmittance spectrum of the h-BN film in the 300–1100 nm λ range (Fig. S3b, ESI†), the transmittance was shown to be 95% or more in the visible region. By the TFSA doping, the Raman G and 2D bands of the GR were shifted to higher wavenumbers (1587 and1602 → 2684 and 2695 cm−1, respectively) and the G to 2D band peak intensity ratio increased (0.45 → 0.62) (Fig. S4a, ESI†), indicating successful doping of the GR.28 The transmittance of the TFSA-GR/quartz substrate was over 96% in the visible region, comparable to that of pristine GR, (Fig. S4b, ESI†), suggesting almost perfect transparency. Before doping, the sheet resistance and work function were 627 Ω sq−1 and −4.57 eV, respectively, but after doping, they were changed to 205 Ω sq−1 (i.e., enhanced conductivity) and −4.88 eV (meaning p-type) (Fig. S4c, ESI†).

The h-BN and GR layers (size = 0.7 × 0.7 cm2) transferred on quartz substrates for the transmittance measurements look very uniform (Fig. S3b and S4b, ESI†). An additional typical optical microscopic (OM) image also showed the uniformity of the 3 materials: TFSA-GR, h-BN, and PSi near the interfaces in the overlapped structure (Fig. S5, ESI†). Almost no big differences were observed in other OM images taken on several locations near the interface. The Raman spectra of h-BN and GR layers showed good crystallinities (Fig. S3a and S4a, ESI†). For further checking the crystallinity, the XPS spectra were recorded for the h-BN and GR layers (Fig. S3c, d and S4d, e, ESI†), also indicating good crystallinities. The roles of the h-BN and BCP layers in the device structure can be understood from the energy band diagram, as described in Fig. 1(b). Here, the work function of the TFSA-GR was measured by us, as shown above, and other band parameters were taken from previous reports.15,28,31,32 When the device is illuminated, the electron–hole pairs produced in PSi are separated into electrons and holes by the built-in electric field. The holes transport through the h-BN layer and then reach the TFSA-GR TCE whilst the electrons are collected by the bottom InGa electrode. The electrons can move well to the cathode by turning back at the h-BN/PSi interface whilst the holes are blocked by the BCP layer.

Fig. 1(c) shows the dark and photo-current density–voltage (J–V) curves of typical TFSA-GR/PSi heterostructures without h-BN and BCP, with only h-BN, and with both layers. The thickness of the BCP was varied from 6 to 35 nm by spin coating. From the thickness-dependent behaviors of the J–V curves, the thickness of the BCP for further characterization was determined to be 20 nm, as shown in the SEM image (Fig. S6, ESI†). As shown in the previous report,32 the tunneling behavior of the current through the h-BN layer is classified as direct and Fowler–Nordheim (FN) tunneling regimes depending on the layer number. If the current flow is associated with FN tunneling, a linear FN plot (a graph ln(I/V2) vs. 1/V) should be observed. One of the major issues in this work is how to decrease the DC for enhancing D*. By considering the thickness-dependent current tunneling regime (direct and FN tunneling)32 and light transmittance at the same time, the optimum thickness of the h-BN layer was determined to be 3.5 nm (∼10 layers), corresponding to the direct tunneling regime. To check this, the FN plots in the full range of bias were drawn. The current mechanism under reverse bias was governed by direct tunneling (Fig. S7a, ESI†). Under forward bias, a transition from FN (confirmed by negative slope) to direct tunneling was observed (Fig. S7b, ESI†), as previously reported.33 These results suggest that the current flow of the TFSA-GR/h-BN/PSi/Si/BCP device with 3.5 nm h-BN is governed principally by direct tunneling as expected, despite a limited effect of FN tunneling, and the DC is minimized.
The DC of the TFSA-GR/PSi heterostructure shows a sharp minimum at 0 V, as shown in Fig. 1(c), resulting from the built-in high energy barrier at the TFSA-GR/PSi interface for the electrons from the TFSA-GR to overcome to go to the PSi, as shown in Fig. 1(b). As the reverse bias increases, the DC increases because the TFSA-GR/PSi interface barrier is lowered due to the up-shift of the Fermi level of the TFSA-GR. The h-BN and/or the BCP layers make it further difficult for the electrons to overcome the TFSA/PSi barrier and/or transport to the InGa electrode, respectively, resulting in the decrease of the DC under full range of reverse bias including zero bias, as shown in Fig. 1(c). Under forward bias, the barrier heights at the TFSA-GR/PSi and PSi/n-Si interfaces are lowered, thereby increasing the DC with increasing the voltage. It is well known that the electron transport through h-BN based on direct or FN tunneling32 results in the decrease of the current. In contrast, a thin BCP can significantly improve the electron injection/collection efficiency by forming new electronic states at the BCP/metal electrode or within the bandgap of the BCP.34,35 Considering these effects, it is understandable why a small decrease in the DC under forward bias is observed by the insertion of the h-BN and the BCP. To further investigate the effects of the h-BN and BCP layers, we analyzed the dark J–V characteristics by the equation: J = Js [exp (eV/nkT) − 1] (Fig. S8, ESI†), based on the thermionic emission model of a non-ideal diode,36 where Js is the ideal reverse saturation current density, n is the ideality factor, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. The n extracted from the slope was 2.11, 1.84, and 1.72 for the PDs without h-BN and BCP, with only h-BN, and with both layers, respectively, caused by the improvements of the interfaces, indicating the enhancement of the diode quality by the use of h-BN and BCP layers.
On the other hand, the current under illumination is almost invariant, irrespective of the existence of the h-BN and BCP, as shown in Fig. 1(c). The h-BN or the BCP layers can play a role in blocking the flow of the photo-induced electrons and holes depending on the direction of the applied bias (forward or reverse), thereby reducing the current. However, electron–hole pairs are generated in all the constituent materials of the TFSA-GR, PSi, and n-Si during illumination, which affects the magnitude of the current in both bias directions. In particular, under reverse and zero bias, the h-BN and BCP barriers are known to be useful for suppressing the electron–hole recombination at the TFSA-GR/PSi and n-Si/InGa interfaces,17,27,37 respectively, as indicated in Fig. 1(b), thereby facilitating the flow of the photo-induced carriers, resulting in the increase of the PC (also the current,  current = DC + PC). As in the case of the DC, BCP can enhance the electron flow at the BCP/InGa interface.34,35 All of these combined trade-off effects possibly explain why negligible variations in the current under illumination occur, irrespective of the insertion of the h-BN and BCP. The PC/DC ratios show delta-function-like maxima at zero voltage for all the PDs, as shown in Fig. 1(d), because the DCs are minimized at zero bias (Fig. 1(c)). In other words, the PDs work well even without an external power supply, i.e., under “self-powered”. We systematically evaluated the performance of the PDs under zero bias, as follows.

Fig. 2(a) shows the responsivity (R) for all the PDs in the 300–1100 nm range. The R was evaluated by the equation R = PC/IL,36 where IL is the incident light power. The PD with h-BN and BCP shows relatively-high R in the broad range of λ with the maximum being 0.584 AW−1 at λ = 870 nm. The spectral external quantum efficiency (EQE) looks more flat in the λ range from ∼400 to ∼900 nm, as shown in Fig. 2(b), because the decrease of the R at the lower λ is compensated by the decrease of λ itself, as clearly seen in the EQE formula: EQE = (hc/q)(1/λ)R, where h is the Planck constant, c is the velocity of light, and q is electron charge. Another important factor for characterizing a PD is the minimum detectable power, in other words, noise equivalent power (NEP). NEP is defined as In/R, where In is the noise current at 1 Hz. In was measured in the f range from 1 to 10 kHz (Fig. S9a, ESI†). The D* was calculated by the formula: D* = (AΔf)1/2/NEP,36 where A is the effective area of the PD (0.5 cm2) and Δf is the electrical bandwidth in Hz. The minimum NEP was 256, 20, and 5 pW Hz−1/2 for the devices without h-BN and BCP, with only h-BN, and with h-BN and BCP, at λ = 870 nm (Fig. S9b, ESI†), resulting in the maximum D* of 2 × 109, 3 × 1010, and 1 × 1011 cm Hz1/2 W−1, respectively (Fig. 2(c)), consistent with the variation of the DC values at zero voltage, as shown in Fig. 1(c). It should be noted that the highest D* is almost 100 times enhanced by the inclusion of the h-BN and BCP, and is comparable to or larger than those ever achieved in self-powered GR/Si-heterojunction PDs (Table S1, ESI†).17,38–42

Fig. 3(a) shows the PC densities as functions of IL. The current density is linearly proportional to IL for all the PDs (see also Fig. S10, ESI†). Here, we adjusted the IL from 0.2 to1000 μW by using a neutral density filter. The linear dynamic range (LDR) was calculated based on the formula: LDR = 20 log (), where  is obtained at a power density of 1 mW cm−2 and Jd is the DC density, resulting in the LDR of 73, 88, and 97 dB for the heterostructures without h-BN and BCP, with only h-BN, and with both layers, respectively. The repetitive on/off current switching behaviors were evaluated under λ = 600 nm illumination at 0 V, as shown in Fig. 3(b), thereby demonstrating the regularity and reversibility of the PD functionality. In addition, a pulsed laser with λ = 532 nm and f =10 kHz was employed to obtain time-resolved decay curves of the PC, as shown in Fig. 3(c). The resulting rise/fall times were estimated to be 3.54/16.78, 3.72/19.12, and 3.98 μs/24.15 μs by fitting the PC decay curves of the heterostructures without h-BN and BCP, with only h-BN, and with both layers, respectively, as summarized in Table 1. The response speed is limited by the lifetime of the photocarriers trapped in the tunnel barriers, but the difference was not significant. The 3dB bandwidth obtained from the f-dependent R is 60500, 53800, and 42400 Hz for the three kinds of PDs, as shown in Fig. 3(d), corresponding to 5.79/16.53, 6.50/18.59, and 8.25/23.58 μs, respectively, for the rise/fall times, indicating the close correlation with those estimated from the decay curves.

The J–V curves of the 3 kinds of heterostructures were measured under illumination AM-1.5G white light (1 sun, 100 mW cm−2) for evaluating the photovoltaic functionality (Fig. S11, ESI†). The photovoltaic parameters of the devices with h-BN and BCP: open circuit voltage, short circuit current density, fill factor, and power conversion efficiency were estimated to be 0.525 V, 33.48 mA cm−2, 78.02%, and 13.71%, respectively (for other devices, see Table S2, ESI†), indicating evident improvement of the photovoltaic energy harvesting by the use of h-BN and BCP layers. These results suggest that the TFSA-GR/h-BN/PSi/Si/BCP heterostructures are bifunctional and self-driving, thereby reducing the power consumption.
Finally, we monitored the on/off switching behaviors of the currents for typical unencapsulated devices for 2000 h under ambient conditions (25 °C temperature/30% humidity) to evaluate the long-term stability, as shown in Fig. 4(a). Fig. 4(b) shows the DC and the PC at λ = 600 nm for 2000 h. The PC maintains almost constant within 2% loss (absolutely from 24.8 to 24.5 mA cm−2) of its initial value for 2000 h. On the other hand, the DC increases by 26% (absolutely from 207.5 to 278.7 pA cm−2) for 2000 h, compared to its initial value. Among the constituent materials of the PD, the TFSA-GR is widely recognized as a major cause for the long-term degradation because the chemical TFSA dopant can be evaporated from GR. So, another well-known p-type dopant, AuCl3, was adopted for comparing the stabilities of the devices (Fig. S12, ESI†), thereby showing relatively excellent long-term stability of the TFSA-GR PD.

4. Conclusion
For the first time, insulating h-BN and passivating BCP layers were successfully employed at the TFSA-GR/PSi interface and on the Si back surface, respectively for concurrently improving the photodetection and energy harvesting properties of the GR/PSi/Si heterostructures. Due to the h-BN and BCP layers, it is more difficult for the electrons to overcome the TFSA-GR/PSi barrier and transport to the InGa electrode, respectively, thereby sharply decreasing the DC, resulting in extreme enhancement (almost 100 times) of specific detectivity. By the use of both layers, photovoltaic parameters were also improved, indicating the bifunctionality of the heterostructures, resulting in their possible applications for self-driving or self-powered optoelectronic devices. The PC and DC were maintained at 98 and 74% of their original values, respectively, even after they were kept in air for 2000 h, indicating the good long-term stability of the devices.
