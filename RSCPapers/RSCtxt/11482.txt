    , Accepted 1st June 2020First published on 16th June 2020AbstractBoth bulk charge separation and surface reaction kinetics are highly important to semiconductor-based water splitting photoanodes. Polyaniline (PANI) with dual functions of hole transport and photothermal conversion is introduced to construct PANI/BiVO4 composite photoanodes. On the one hand, bulk charge separation is enhanced due to the formation of a p–n heterojunction. On the other hand, the charge separation efficiency is further improved because of the temperature elevation induced by the photothermal effect of PANI. In addition, cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi) as a cocatalyst is introduced to accelerate the surface water oxidation reaction, which is also further promoted via the photothermal effect of PANI. Assisted by NIR light, the resultant Co-Pi/PANI/BiVO4 photoanode achieves a remarkable water oxidation photocurrent of 4.05 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE (V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode), over 300% higher than that of the pristine BiVO4 photoanode. The introduction of the photothermal effect can be extended to improve the PEC performance of other photoelectrodes, such as Fe2O3, WO3 and TiO2.
Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has been widely regarded as one of the promising approaches to convert solar energy into chemical fuels.1,2 Since its initial discovery by Fujishima and Honda with a TiO2 electrode in 1970s,3 a variety of metal oxides, such as Fe2O3, TiO2, WO3 and BiVO4, have been extensively studied as photoanode materials for PEC conversion. Among the available photoelectrodes, BiVO4 has emerged as one of the most attractive candidates owing to its narrow band gap (ca. 2.4 eV), favourable band edge positions, and excellent PEC stability in aqueous solution. However, the reported photocurrent densities of unmodified BiVO4 films are still much lower than their theoretical value of 7.5 mA cm−2 under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) due to severe bulk charge recombination and high kinetic barriers for surface water oxidation, which are regarded as the two main intrinsic drawbacks that limit the PEC performance of BiVO4 photoanodes. Generally, morphology control,4–6 oxygen vacancy introduction,7–9 compositional engineering,10–12 and heterojunction construction13,14 are effective strategies to reduce the charge recombination in bulk BiVO4via the modification of the electronic structures or charge migration distance. In addition, the deposition of oxygen evolution cocatalysts (OECs), e.g., Co-Pi, CoOx, FeOOH, and NiOOH, has proved to be an efficient strategy for accelerating surface water oxidation kinetics at the interface of the electrode and electrolyte.15–19
Recently, operating temperature has been proved to be a critical factor for improving the PEC performance of photoanodes.20 BiVO4 is one kind of small-polaron-type conduction semiconductor, in which minority carrier (i.e., holes) hopping can be activated by moderate temperature elevation.21 Thus, elevating the temperature of photoanodes is an efficient strategy to increase bulk charge separation. Moreover, the water oxidation activity of OECs is found to be enhanced by elevating the operating temperature of the electrolyzer. For example, the potential of Co-Pi for reaching a current density of 1.0 mA cm−2 decreases from 1.29 to 1.04 V when the temperature of electrolyte is raised from 15 to 65 °C.22 The catalytic current densities of FeC–Ni core–shell nanoparticles dramatically increase due to magnetic heating in an external high-frequency alternating magnetic field.23
As we know, photothermal materials, including plasmonic metals, semiconducting materials, carbon materials and organic materials, can convert near-infrared (NIR) light into thermal energy instantly.24–26 This photothermal conversion has been widely used in water purification and cancer therapy, while its application in the PEC process is still unclear. Inspired by the above research results, photothermal materials can be used as sources of heat which can be introduced into photoanodes to increase the temperature of the composite electrode in situ, without the requirement for additional heating devices.
Herein, polyaniline (PANI) with dual functions of hole transport and photothermal conversion was coupled with Co-Pi/BiVO4 to form Co-Pi/PANI/BiVO4 (CPB) composite photoanodes. Firstly, the photogenerated holes could be effectively extracted from the BiVO4 bulk for suppressing electron–hole recombination due to the formation of a PANI/BiVO4 p–n heterojunction. Then, the temperature of CPB photoanodes could be elevated under the irradiation of NIR light due to the photothermal effect of PANI, leading to the acceleration of both bulk charge separation and surface water oxidation. Assisted by NIR light, the resulting CPB photoanodes exhibited an outstanding PEC performance for water oxidation, and a photocurrent of 4.05 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE (V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode) was obtained under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination, over 3-fold higher than that of the pristine BiVO4 photoanode (0.98 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE), confirming the potential application of the photothermal effect in PEC water splitting.
Experimental section
The preparation process of the Co-Pi/PANI/BiVO4 photoanode is illustrated in Scheme S1,† in order to construct a well-defined electrocatalyst/photothermal and hole-transport semiconductor/photocatalyst composite system for highly efficient PEC reactions.
Preparation of BiVO4 films
Firstly, 0.4 M KI and 30 mM lactic acid were added into 50 mL deionized water for use as the precursor solution. The pH of the precursor solution was adjusted to 1.8 with concentrated HNO3, and then 0.015 M Bi(NO3)3·5H2O was added into this solution with vigorous stirring until Bi(NO3)3·5H2O was completely dissolved. After that, 0.046 M p-benzoquinone was dissolved in 20 mL absolute ethanol, this prepared solution was slowly added into the precursor solution containing the Bi element and stirred evenly. A typical three-electrode cell was used for electrodeposition. F-doped SnO2 (FTO, area of 1 × 3 cm2), an Ag/AgCl electrode and a Pt electrode served as the working electrode (WE), the reference electrode (RE) and the counter electrode (CE), respectively. Cathodic deposition was conducted potentiostatically at −0.35 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 30 s and −0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 1200 s at room temperature. The orange-red BiOI was washed with deionized water and then dried under nitrogen. Then, 0.2 M vanadyl acetylacetonate (VO(acac)2) was dissolved in 2 mL dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and 0.1 mL of this solution was placed on the BiOI electrode (1 × 2 cm2) and annealed for 2 hours in a muffle furnace at 450 °C (heating rate = 2 °C min−1) to transform into BiVO4 and V2O5. The BiVO4 electrode was immersed in NaOH solution (1 M) for 5 minutes to remove excess V2O5. Finally, the BiVO4 electrode was rinsed with pure water and dried in a 60 °C oven.
Preparation of PANI/BiVO4 photoanode
Firstly, 0.1 M aniline (C6H5NH2, AR) was dissolved in 70 mL deionized water and decomposed uniformly under ultrasonication for 30 minutes. Then, the pH of this solution was adjusted to 3 with HCl as electrolyte. In a three-electrode system, BiVO4 (1 × 3 cm2) thin films were used as the working electrode (WE), saturated Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode (RE), and Pt (1.5 × 1.5 cm2) as the counter electrode (CE). BiVO4 was deposited at 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 30 s under 1.5G simulated solar irradiation and after bias deposited at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 60 s in the same solution without light deposition. The resulting PANI/BiVO4 photoanodes were rinsed with deionized water and dried at 80 °C.
Deposition of Co-Pi on the PANI/BiVO4 composite electrode
The surface of the PANI/BiVO4 film was covered with the Co-Pi cocatalyst layer by a simple technology named “photoelectrochemical deposition method”. The PANI/BiVO4 thin film was immersed in the electrolyte (0.1 M K2HPO4 and KH2PO4 (pH 7)) with 0.5 mM Co(NO3)2. Co-Pi layers with appropriate thickness were electrodeposited at 15 mC cm−2. A 1.5G filter was used as a light source to obtain simulated sunlight. The power intensity of the simulated sunlight was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2. Photo-assisted electrodeposition was conducted at 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 400 s.
Characterization
The morphology and size of the materials were characterized using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, SU8010) with an X-ray energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Talos F200S) images were visualized using a transmission electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 120 kV. The light absorption properties of the as-prepared samples were measured using a UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectrometer (UV-2550PC spectrophotometer). The chemical state was characterized with Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR, Nicolet Corp, USA). The surface bonding information was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Physical Electronics PHI 1600 ESCA), and the binding energy was calibrated with C 1s (284.6 eV).
The PEC water-splitting measurements were carried out with an electrochemical workstation (CHI 650E) in a standard three-electrode system in 0.5 M KH2PO4 aqueous solution (pH 7). The composite structures of pure BiVO4, PANI/BiVO4, and CPB acted as the WE, and platinum foil (1.5 × 1.5 cm−2) and a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode acted as the CE and RE, respectively. The photocurrent–potential curves were measured by scanning with a continuous voltage change at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. The measured potential (vs. Ag/AgCl) was converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) according to the Nernst equation: (ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 × pH + 0.1976),27 where EAg/AgCl is the applied potential vs. Ag/AgCl and 0.1976 V is the standard potential of the Ag/AgCl reference electrode at 25 °C. All photoanodes were illuminated by simulated sunlight through the FTO side (i.e., a backside illumination). Using N2 as a carrier gas, H2 and O2 gases that evolved from the PEC cell were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC7920) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The light source and electrolyte were the same as those used for the above PEC measurements, and the gas products were sampled every 30 min. Before measuring, the system needs to be evacuated to remove residual air. Under AM 1.5G illumination, the photoanode was immersed in KPi solution (0.5 M, pH 7) slightly.
Calculations
The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) and applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) were measured at 1.23 VRHE in the same electrolyte and three-electrode device. A 300 W xenon lamp was used to afford simulated 1 sun light irradiation conditions (100 mW cm−2) by using a solar simulator with an AM 1.5G filter and monochromator couple to scan the wavelength of the incident light. The IPCE was calculated using the following equation:1,28  where λ is the wavelength of the incident light, I is the measured photocurrent density at the corresponding wavelength, and Plight is the measured light power density at that wavelength (100 mW cm−2 in this work). The ABPE was calculated from the J–V curve shown in Fig. 4b. Assuming 100% faradaic efficiency, the value of the ABPE was obtained using the following equation:28  where I is the photocurrent density at a specific potential, V bias is the applied bias between the WE and RHE, and Plight is the incident illumination power density (100 mW cm−2).
The photocurrent density under sulfite oxidation conditions was calculated using the following formula:29JPEC = Jabs × ηsep × ηinjwhere Jabs represents the photocurrent density, which is the value for the electrodes thoroughly converting the absorbed photons to current. The Jabs values of BiVO4, PANI/BiVO4 and CPB were 6.06 mA cm−2, 6.14 mA cm−2 and 6.28 mA cm−2, which were calculated by overlapped area integration of the standard solar absorption spectrum and UV-Vis absorption spectrum, respectively (Fig. S9d†). ηinj (relating to bulk charge separation) and ηsep (relating to surface reaction kinetics) could be determined by using the following formulas:3  where Jsulfite and Jwater are the photocurrent density in the electrolyte with and without sulfite oxidation shown in Fig. S9a–c,† respectively. The Mott–Schottky plot was used to determine electro-chemical properties using the equation:28,29  where ε0 is the permittivity of free space (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), ε is the dielectric constant of BiVO4 (68), e0 is the electron charge (1.60 × 10−19 C), and d(1/C2)/dv is the slope of the curve at an amplitude of 10 mV and a frequency of 103 Hz. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out by applying a small AC amplitude of 50 mV and a frequency range from 104 to 10−2 Hz at the open circuit potential.
Using N2 as a carrier gas, H2 and O2 gases that evolved from the PEC cell were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC7920) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The light source and electrolyte were the same as those used for the above PEC measurements, and the gas products were sampled every 30 min. Before measuring, the system needs to be in a vacuum to remove residual air. Under AM 1.5G illumination, the photoanode was immersed in KPi solution (0.5 M, pH 7) slightly.30
Results and discussion
To visually investigate the morphology and microscopic structure of the obtained photoanode, the field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of pure BiVO4 and PANI/BiVO4 were recorded. Fig. 1a shows the typical three-dimensional worm-like structure with a diameter of about 200–250 nm. After the modification with PANI, the SEM image of PANI/BiVO4 (Fig. 1b) exhibits a rough appearance, indicating the coating of PANI on the surface of BiVO4.

According to the TEM image shown in Fig. 1c, the BiVO4 nanoworm is coated with a layer of PANI with a thickness of about 15 nm. It is worth mentioning that BiVO4 is closely enwrapped by PANI, which is favourable for the transfer of photo-charges and heat generated by BiVO4 and PANI, respectively. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image in Fig. 1d shows the amorphous structure of PANI due to the low crystallinity of PANI organic compounds.31 In addition, the interplanar spacing of BiVO4 is found to be ∼0.59 nm, which corresponds to the (020) plane. As shown in Fig. 1e, the energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental map of PANI/BiVO4 displays the signals of Bi, V, O, C and N elements, verifying that the PANI thin film is uniformly distributed on the surface of worm-like BiVO4.
XPS analysis was carried out to obtain more information about the surface electronic states and chemical composition of PANI/BiVO4 (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 2a, the doublet broad peaks at 159.4 and 164.6 eV are clearly observed in the Bi 4f region, which is ascribed to the presence of Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 for Bi3+ characteristic peaks, respectively. The V 2p peaks shown in Fig. 2b are fully consistent with the V 2p typical values of V5+, which belong to BiVO4.32,33 The C 1s level spectrum of PANI is shown in Fig. 2c, which can be deconvoluted into four peaks: 284.5, 285.8 and 287.1 eV, corresponding to C–C/C–H, C–N+/C–N+/C–C and CO/C–O, respectively. Moreover, the N 1s characteristic peak is also observed in Fig. 2d, which is decomposed into imine nitrogen (–N) at 399.6 eV and amine nitrogen (–NH) at 400.6 eV.34,35

As a typical small polaron carrier conduction semiconductor, the PEC performance of the BiVO4 photoanode has been proved to be enhanced via the elevation of the operating temperature due to the activation of minority carrier hopping at relatively high temperatures. As shown in Fig. 3a, the photocurrent density increases from 1.05 to 2.40 mA cm−2 when the electrolyte temperature is raised from 20 to 60 °C, which is consistent with a previous report.21

In addition to the conducting p-type semiconductor properties, PANI is also a typical photothermal polymer material, which can convert infrared light into heat. As shown in Fig. S1,† the temperature of the pure PANI film increases from room temperature to about 53 °C rapidly under the irradiation of NIR light in 100 s. Under the same condition, the temperature change of pure BiVO4 and PANI/BiVO4 photoanodes is displayed in Fig. 3b. As expected, the temperature increment of the PANI/BiVO4 photoanode reaches about 12 °C within 100 s. However the temperature of the pure BiVO4 photoanode exhibits a negligible change. These results indicate that the PANI/BiVO4 photoanode can be heated in situ via the photothermal effect of PANI.
To find the effect of photothermal conversion on the PEC performance of the BiVO4 photoanode, the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of the obtained photoanodes without or with NIR irradiation were obtained (displayed in Fig. 4a). The pristine BiVO4 electrode exhibits a photocurrent density of 0.98 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE. After the coating of the PANI layer, a highly improved photocurrent density is achieved by the PANI/BiVO4 photoanode due to the formation of a p–n heterojunction. Importantly, when irradiated by NIR light, the PANI/BiVO4 photoanode (denoted as PANI/BiVO4-NIR) shows an obviously increased photocurrent density at all potentials with a photocurrent density of 2.45 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE, verifying the positive effect of photothermal conversion on the solar-to-fuel performance of the BiVO4 photoanode. Moreover, considering that the loading amount of PANI is a key factor for both the photothermal conversion and the PEC performance of the PANI/BiVO4 p–n heterojunction, the effects of PANI loading on the PEC performance of PANI/BiVO4-NIR photoanodes are discussed in detail. The PANI amount was determined from the concentration of aniline, which was set as 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08 and 0.10 M (denoted as 2-PANI/BiVO4, 4-PANI/BiVO4, 6-PANI/BiVO4, 8-PANI/BiVO4 and 10-PANI/BiVO4, respectively). Apparently, the temperature of PANI/BiVO4-NIR photoanodes increases with the content of PANI, as shown in Fig. S2a.† However, excessive loading amount of PANI leads to severe bulk charge recombination due to the short hole diffusion length, thereby resulting in a decreased photocurrent density (Fig. S2b†). Consequently, the PEC performance of PANI/BiVO4-NIR is significantly affected by the PANI amount, and the highest PEC performance (2.45 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE) is achieved with 0.06 M aniline solution due to the synergistic effect of photothermal conversion and the p–n heterojunction (Fig. S2c and d†).

(c) IPCE of BiVO4, PANI/BiVO4 and CPB photoanodes at 1.23 VRHE with or without the NIR laser. (d) H2 and O2 evolution of the BiVO4 and CPB-NIR photoanodes at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5G illumination. All measurements were obtained in 0.5 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7). 
To fully utilize the surface-reached holes, Co-Pi acting as the OEC was further deposited on the surface of the PANI/BiVO4 photoanode. XPS spectra of the Co-Pi/PANI/BiVO4 (CPB) photoanode were obtained to confirm the successful deposition of Co-Pi. Fig. S3a† presents the two main peaks of Co 2p1/2 (796.4 eV) and Co 2p3/2 (781.6 eV) with two satellite peaks, indicating the coexistence of Co3+ and Co2+ in the Co-Pi layer. The relative molar ratio of Co3+/Co2+ is calculated to be 2.06, demonstrating that there may be a small number of vacancy defects in Co-Pi.36 These energy level defects may generate a large amount of energy (thermal energy) as a non-radiative recombination center after NIR light irradiation. Furthermore, the XPS spectra of the phosphorous 2p region (Fig. S3b†) show a single peak at 133 eV due to phosphate in the electrodeposited Co-Pi confirming the formation of Co-Pi on the PANI/BiVO4 electrode.2,29 Under AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 simulated sunlight, the photocurrent of the CPB photoanode is significantly improved due to the rapid oxygen evolution reaction at the interface of the electrode and electrolyte. The photothermal conversion performance of CPB was also evaluated (Fig. S4†), which exhibits a similar result as compared to PANI/BiVO4 (displayed in Fig. 3b), indicating that the deposition of Co-Pi has no adverse effect on the photothermal properties of the electrode. Upon exposure to NIR light, the photocurrent density of the CPB photoanode (denoted as CPB-NIR) further increases and reaches a maximum value of about 4.05 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE, which is 4 times that of pure BiVO4. Assisted by the photothermal effect of PANI, the photocurrent of the CPB-NIR photoanode is comparable to that of some of the best reported BiVO4-based photoanodes, as shown in Table S1.†
The photoconversion efficiency of the obtained photoelectrodes at an applied voltage, which is a useful PEC performance indicator, was determined by calculating the ABPE. As shown in Fig. 4b, the optimal photoconversion efficiency is only 0.1% at 1.23 VRHE for bare BiVO4 photoanodes. A much higher optimal conversion efficiency of 1.4% at 0.6 VRHE is achieved for the CPB photoanode due to the successive deposition of PANI and Co-Pi. Moreover, the best ABPE is obtained in the case of the CPB-NIR sample with additional NIR light irradiation (1.8% at 0.6 VRHE), indicating that the photothermal effect is beneficial for the improvement of the photoconversion efficiency of the photoelectrode. The monochromatic IPCE data at 1.23 VRHE for the obtained photoanodes at their best performance are shown in Fig. 4c, which show a similar distribution to current–potential characteristics. PANI/BiVO4-NIR reaches a maximum of 40% at 350 nm, while only 25% is obtained for PANI/BiVO4. Moreover, CPB-NIR reaches the highest value of 70% at 370 nm, which is much higher than that of the CPB electrode (ca. 42% at a wavelength of 400 nm). For both ABPE and IPCE data, the increments from CBP to CBP-NIR are more significant than those from PANI/BiVO4 to PANI/BiVO4-NIR photoanodes, demonstrating that the photothermal effect has a positive effect on both PEC performance of the inner BiVO4 photoelectrode and catalytic properties of the outer Co-Pi electrocatalyst.
Furthermore, the corresponding H2 and O2 evolution for the CPB-NIR photoanode was measured by gas chromatography (GC) every 30 min under irradiation with both solar light and NIR light. As shown in Fig. 4d, the produced H2 and O2 evolution values of CPB-NIR are 213 and 90 μmol cm−2 after 120 min, respectively, corresponding to the ≈2:1 ratio of the water splitting reaction. The faradaic efficiency for O2 evolution at 1.23 VRHE is 96%, indicating that most of the photogenerated holes are used for water oxidation. Since stability is a key factor to achieve commercial viability for PEC hydrogen production devices, a stability test was performed at 1.23 VRHE. As shown in Fig. S5,† CPB photoanodes with NIR irradiation exhibit excellent stability with negligible photocurrent decay after 7500 s of the PEC water splitting reaction, indicating that NIR irradiation has no negative effect on the stability of pure BiVO4.
The Mott–Schottky plots of BiVO4, PANI/BiVO4 and PANI/BiVO4-NIR were investigated (Fig. 5a) to study the bulk charge separation process of photoanodes with the assistance of the photothermal effect. The plot of pure BiVO4 displays a positive slope, indicating the expected n-type semiconductor characteristics with electrons as the majority carriers. While, the curve slope of pure PANI is a negative value (Fig. S6†), which shows the p-type semiconductor features of pristine PANI. After attachment of the p-type PANI layer, the flat band potential (Efb) of PANI/BiVO4, determined by extrapolating the Mott–Schottky plot to 1/C2 = 0, shifts to a positive value, confirming the formation of a p–n heterojunction between PANI and BiVO4. Moreover, the calculated carrier density (Nd) of PANI/BiVO4-NIR reaches 2.65 × 1021 cm−3, which is substantially higher than that of the PANI/BiVO4 photoanode (1.65 × 1021 cm−3). This means that the photothermal conversion is favourable for the increase of the carrier concentration, and consequently contributes to an efficient charge separation in the bulk of the composite electrode. In addition, the PL behaviour, originating from the recombination of the photo-excited electrons and holes, of the obtained photoanodes was studied to reflect the separation of photogenerated charge carriers in semiconductors (Fig. S7†). The pristine BiVO4 displays rather strong PL emission peaks at about 490 nm, which are attributed to the band gap transition. The PL intensity decreases sharply after the deposition of PANI due to the efficient charge separation at the p–n heterojunction, as shown in Fig. S8.† Under irradiation with NIR light, the PL emission intensity further declines, indicating that both the p-type semiconductor properties and photothermal effect of PANI suppress radiative recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. Moreover, the charge transfer properties of photoanodes assisted by the photothermal effect were identified by electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements under simulated solar light illumination at 1.23 VRHE. In the EIS analysis, the diameter of the semicircle reflects the charge transfer resistance at the interface of the photoelectrode/electrolyte, in which the smaller semicircle indicates faster interfacial charge transport. As shown in Fig. 5b, the CPB-NIR electrode presents the lowest resistance, indicating that photothermal conversion could dramatically reduce the interfacial charge transfer resistance, which is favourable for the hole transport from the bulk to surface.

(c) Current–potential curves of BiVO4, PANI/BiVO4 and CPB in the dark with or without the NIR laser. (d) Charging current differences measured at 0.85 V plotted against scan rates for each photoanode. 
To further investigate the effect of photothermal properties on the electrocatalytic water oxidation performance of the outer Co-Pi electrocatalyst, the dark LSV curves were obtained (Fig. 5c). It is apparent that the Co-Pi overlayer enhances the kinetics in water oxidation of PANI/BiVO4 both in terms of a cathodic shift in the onset potential (by 400 mV) and an increase in photocurrent density. As in the case of the CPB-NIR photoanode, a noticeable cathodic shift (420 mV) in the onset potential compared to the curve of CPB was observed, indicating the improvement of the catalytic performance of Co-Pi electrocatalysts induced by the photothermal effect of PANI. According to the previous report, the rates of catalytic processes and the water oxidation reaction, on the one hand, are enhanced by the elevated operating temperature. On the other hand, the evolution of O2 generated on the surface of photoanodes is accelerated with the elevation temperature. These findings are the main reasons for the modified electrocatalytic properties of Co-Pi with moderate temperature elevation, which in turn leads to the enhancement of PEC performance of CPB-NIR photoanodes. Moreover, there is no significant current for both PANI/BiVO4-NIR and CPB-NIR photoanodes before 1.5 VRHE, indicating that photo-charges cannot be generated under the illumination of NIR light.
The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) is a useful tool to evaluate the water oxidation properties at the surface of photoanode, and was estimated from the double layer capacitance (Cdl) of the electrode surface. With Cdl calculated from the slope of current densities as a function of the scan rates in the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves (Fig. S9†), it is observable that the Cdl of CPB (107.93 μF cm−2) is much higher than that of PANI/BiVO4 (48.88 μF cm−2) due to the excellent catalytic properties of Co-Pi. Upon irradiation with NIR light, Cdl of CPB-NIR further increases up to 122.63 μF cm−2 (Fig. 5d), indicating that the moderate temperature elevation benefits the expansion of the ECSA.
To quantify the synergistic effect of photothermal conversion and p–n heterostructures on bulk charge separation and surface reaction kinetics, the efficiency of bulk (ηsep) and surface (ηinj) charge separation was investigated and determined by using Na2SO3 as a hole scavenger. The measurement procedures are detailed in Fig. S10† and the calculated results are shown in Fig. S11a and b.† Due to the severe charge recombination, the ηsep of bare BiVO4 is only 34% at 1.23 VRHE. The modification with PANI helps achieve a ηsep of 60% at 1.23 VRHE, implying that the bulk recombination of photogenerated charges is significantly suppressed upon the formation of the PANI/BiVO4 p–n heterojunction. Under irradiation with NIR light, the ηsep of PANI/BiVO4-NIR further increases to 72% at 1.23 VRHE, confirming the efficient bulk charge separation via the introduction of the photothermal effect, which is mainly attributed to the fast hole transport by temperature elevation. From Fig. S11b,† an enhanced ηinj (30% at 1.00 VRHE) is observed in PANI/BiVO4 relative to pure BiVO4 (20% at 1.00 VRHE), 40% at 1.00 VRHE. The passivation effect is possibly introduced by the deposition of PANI, and this effect is reinforced when the operating temperature is elevated. Moreover, a giant improvement is obtained (65% for CPB at 1.00 VRHE) with the integration of Co-Pi, an OEC, due to its highly efficient surface water oxidation kinetics. As the electrocatalytic process can be improved via temperature elevation, the ηinj of CPB-NIR achieves 78% at 1.00 VRHE. Thus, the introduction of the photothermal effect is responsible for the effective charge separation of both the bulk and surface.
Conclusions
In summary, PANI with dual functions, e.g., hole transport and the photothermal effect, was introduced into BiVO4 photoanodes to demonstrate the potential application of photothermal conversion in PEC water splitting. The sequential deposition of PANI and Co-Pi is a typical method to resolve the intrinsic bulk and surface charge recombination of BiVO4 photoanodes, respectively. Furthermore, upon irradiation with NIR light, the bulk charge separation and surface water oxidation kinetics are simultaneously accelerated due to the moderate temperature elevation induced by the photothermal effect of PANI. Assisted by NIR light, the resulting Co-Pi/PANI/BiVO4 photoanode exhibits a remarkable photocurrent of 4.05 mA cm−2 under AM 1.5G illumination, over three times higher than that of the pristine photoanodes. The new findings will pave the way toward low-cost, efficient, and stable photothermal materials with holes or electrons conducting property for sustainable solar energy conversion, including H2 generation, CO2 reduction and N2 fixation.
