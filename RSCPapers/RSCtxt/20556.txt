    , Accepted 2nd December 2016First published on 5th December 2016AbstractThe low photocatalytic performance of a single photocatalyst mainly originates from a fast recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. Rational design and construction of direct solid-state Z-scheme photocatalysts is an effective approach to improve the charge separation efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. In this study, a series of Z-scheme In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composite photocatalysts with a different content of In2S3 were synthesized using a facile chemical precipitation method and characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS), photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and photoelectrochemical measurements. The photocatalytic activity of the In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composites was evaluated through photodegradation of methyl orange (MO) under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). The results demonstrate that the optimal Z-scheme In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composite with a theoretical weight content of 4.0% In2S3 provided a photodegradation rate constant for MO of 0.0087 min−1, which is approximately 2.8 and 5.4 times higher than those of pure In2S3 and Ag2CrO4, respectively. The enhanced photocatalytic activity may be attributed to the formation of a Z-scheme system between In2S3 and Ag2CrO4, effectively prolonging the lifetime of the photoinduced electrons generated by In2S3 and the photoinduced holes generated by Ag2CrO4, which was subsequently confirmed using active species trapping experiments, photoluminescence techniques and photoelectrochemical assays. This work may be useful for rationally designing new types of Z-scheme photocatalysts and provides some illuminating insights into the Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism for application in the solar energy conversion and environmental remediation fields.
1. Introduction
Due to increasingly deteriorating environmental situations and energy dilemmas, environmentally friendly semiconductor-based photocatalysis techniques have aroused extraordinary attention due to their promising applications in the degradation of organic pollutants into CO2 and H2O, water splitting to produce hydrogen, and disinfection.1 In particular, visible light photocatalysis has become an imperative topic in the photocatalysis field as it can directly harvest energy from incoming solar energy and offers a desirable way of dealing with the issues of energy shortage and environmental remediation.2 On the other hand, compared to conventional photocatalysts, such as TiO2 and ZnO, with a wide band-gap that are only active under ultraviolet light (ca. 4% of the solar spectrum3) irradiation, visible light (ca. 45% of the solar spectrum4) photocatalysts can utilize solar energy more efficiently. As a consequence, numerous researchers have paid eager attention to the design and preparation of novel visible-light driven photocatalysts with a narrow band-gap and high photocatalytic efficiency, such as N doped TiO2,5 WO3,6 Co3O4,7 CdS,8 BiVO4,9 BiOX (X = Cl, Br, I),10 Bi2XO6 (X = W, Mo),11 Ag3PO4,12 AgX (X = Cl, Br, I),13 Ag2CrO4,14 g-C3N4,15 and more. Among them, it is noteworthy that silver chromate (Ag2CrO4), a novel high-efficiency visible light driven photocatalyst with a relatively narrow band gap (ca. 1.8 eV), has been highly investigated and has been demonstrated to be one of the most available and attractive photocatalysts for the degradation of organic pollutants under visible light irradiation, due to its strong absorption in the visible-light region, unique electronic structure and crystal structure.16 The valence band position of Ag2CrO4 has been raised by the hybridization of the Ag 4d and O 2p orbitals, and the conduction band position has been lowered by the Cr element, leading to a narrow band gap of approximately 1.8 eV. On the other hand, the crystal structure of Ag2CrO4 is beneficial for effectively facilitating the migration of photogenerated electrons and holes, due to the long Ag–O bond length and large O–Ag–O bond angle of the AgO6 octahedron.16b,c,17 Unfortunately, the photocatalytic performance of Ag2CrO4 is still restricted due to the following three main factors: firstly, the photogenerated charge carriers in pure Ag2CrO4 can easily recombine. Secondly, similar to other Ag-containing compounds (such as Ag3PO418), Ag2CrO4 also suffers from poor photostability during photocatalytic reactions due to it being photosensitive and slightly soluble in aqueous solutions.19 Thirdly, the conduction band (CB) position (ca. 0.50 eV16b) of Ag2CrO4 is less negative than the standard redox potential of O2/˙O2− (−0.33 V vs. NHE),20 resulting in the photogenerated electrons in the CB of Ag2CrO4 being unable to react with O2 to produce ˙O2−. Consequently, it is essential to design and develop an effective strategy for enhancing the stability and activity of Ag2CrO4 photocatalysts.
Fortunately, in comparison with single-component semiconductor photocatalysts, the construction of an artificial Z-scheme photocatalytic system composed of two or more semiconductors is an ideal and effective strategy for promoting the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and enhancing the photocatalytic performance, because it can not only allow interfacial charge migration upon excitation and boosting of the separation efficiency for photogenerated electron–hole pairs, but can also preserve the excellent redox ability.20,21 This strategy makes the composite photocatalyst utilize both the reduction ability of the semiconductor with a more negative conduction band potential and the oxidation ability of the other semiconductor with a more positive valence band potential.22 Therefore, Z-scheme photocatalytic systems are more desirable than traditional band–band transfer photocatalytic systems for preserving the original redox ability. To date, a large number of Z-scheme photocatalytic systems have been fabricated and developed to achieve a higher photocatalytic efficiency in comparison with those of the single components under visible light irradiation, such as SnS2/Ag3PO4,23 CdS/WO3,24 g-C3N4/Bi2MoO6,25 AgI/β-Bi2O3,26 CoTiO3/g-C3N4,21 CdS/CdWO4,27 BiOBr/Bi2MoO6,28 and so forth. More recently, indium sulfide (In2S3), as a III–VI group sulfide with a band gap of 2.0–2.3 eV, has been reported to be one of the most promising photocatalysts for the photodegradation of organic pollutants and photocatalytic water splitting under visible light irradiation due to its high photosensitivity and photoconductivity, excellent illumination stability, stable chemical and physical characteristics and low toxicity.29 Furthermore, In2S3 has suitable band edges (ECB = −0.9 eV, EVB = 1.3 eV29b,30), which can match well with Ag2CrO4 (ECB = 0.50 eV, EVB = 2.22 eV16a,b). Inspired by the above, we noted that combining Ag2CrO4 with In2S3 would probably form a direct solid-state Z-scheme photocatalytic system. If that can be accomplished, the photoexcited electrons in the conduction band (CB) of In2S3 would show a strong reduction ability and the photoexcited holes in the valence band (VB) of Ag2CrO4 would exhibit a strong oxidation ability, respectively. As a consequence, if In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composites are prepared, it is likely that composites with a higher photocatalytic performance will be obtained. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no report on the synthesis and photocatalytic properties of In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composite photocatalysts.
In the present study, we report for the first time the fabrication of a novel solid-state Z-scheme In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composite photocatalyst via a facile chemical precipitation method without any surfactant. A series of characterization techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS), photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and photoelectrochemical measurements, were employed to investigate the crystal structure and morphology as well as the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers within the In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composite photocatalyst. The photodegradation of methyl orange (MO) dye in an aqueous solution was used to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of the In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composites under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm), and the optimal photocatalyst is demonstrated to exhibit a higher photocatalytic activity than pure Ag2CrO4 or In2S3. The enhanced photocatalytic activity is mainly attributed to the efficient separation of electron–hole pairs via Z-scheme charge transfer and a possible photocatalytic reaction mechanism is proposed and rationalized based on active species trapping experiments, a photoluminescence technique and photoelectrochemical assays. The present work not only provides new Z-scheme photocatalysts with an improved performance, but also provides better insight into the formation mechanism of solid-state two-component Z-scheme photocatalytic systems.
2. Experimental
2.1 Catalyst preparation
In2S3 nanoplates were prepared using a facile hydrothermal method according to a modified reported procedure.29a,c In a typical procedure, 3 mmol of In(NO3)3·4.5H2O and 12 mmol of thiourea were dissolved in 70 mL of distilled water under magnetic stirring. After 30 min, the obtained solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, sealed and maintained at 180 °C for 24 h. When the autoclave had cooled naturally to room temperature, the precipitate was collected using centrifugation, washed several times with distilled water and absolute ethanol, and dried at 55 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h.
In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composites were fabricated using a facile in situ chemical precipitation method under dark conditions according to a modified reported procedure.16b In a typical procedure, first of all, a certain amount of the as-prepared In2S3 sample (13.5 mg, 27.6 mg and 42.3 mg) was dispersed thoroughly within 40 mL of distilled water with the assistance of ultrasonication for 30 min. Then, 4 mmol of AgNO3 was added into the dispersion of In2S3 under vigorous stirring. After stirring for 30 min, 2 mmol of K2CrO4 dissolved in 40 mL of distilled water was added dropwise into the dispersion, with constant stirring, and the mixture was then vigorously stirred at room temperature for 4 h. Finally, the precipitate was collected using centrifugation, washed several times with distilled water and absolute ethanol, and dried at 55 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h. The obtained products were denoted as In2S3(x)/Ag2CrO4, where x% stands for the theoretical mass percentage of In2S3 in the In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composite. That is to say, the as-prepared samples were accordingly denoted as In2S3(2.0 wt%)/Ag2CrO4, In2S3(4.0 wt%)/Ag2CrO4 and In2S3(6.0 wt%)/Ag2CrO4. Moreover, for comparison, pure Ag2CrO4 nanoparticles were also synthesized following a procedure similar to that mentioned above in the absence of In2S3.
2.2 Catalyst characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-prepared samples were obtained with an X-ray diffractometer (D/max-IIIA, Japan) using Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA, with 2θ = 20–70° and a scanning rate of 10° min−1. The surface morphologies and microstructures of the as-prepared samples were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (LEO1530VP, LEO Company) at an acceleration voltage of 15 kV and using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, JEOL, JEM-2100) operated at 200 kV. Specimens for HRTEM were prepared by ultrasonically suspending the sample in ethanol and depositing a drop of the suspension onto a grid. UV-vis light absorption spectra of the as-prepared samples were obtained using a Hitachi UV-3010 spectrophotometer, with a collection speed of 40 nm min−1 over a wavelength range of 200–800 nm. The spectrophotometer was equipped with an integrating sphere assembly and a diffuse reflection method was used, with BaSO4 as a reference, to measure all the samples, and all the samples were pressed into pellets in the sample holder. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed with a Krato Axis ultra DLD spectrometer equipped with an Al Kα X-ray source at 12 kV and 20 mA. The binding energies were referenced to the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV for calibration, and all the spectral peaks were deconvoluted using XPSPEAK41 software with mixed Gaussian–Lorentzian functions after subtraction of the linear-type background. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 270 nm, and all the samples were pressed into pellets in the sample holder.
2.3 Photocatalytic activity tests
The photocatalytic performance of the as-prepared samples was evaluated through photodegradation of MO under visible light. A 300 W Xe-arc lamp equipped with a 420 nm cutoff filter was used as the visible light source and the average light intensity striking the surface of the reaction solution was about 50 mW cm−2, as measured using a UV-A radiometer. In a typical photocatalytic experiment, a suspension including the photocatalyst (50 mg) and MO solution (150 mL, 10 mg L−1) was placed in a 250 mL cylindrical quartz reactor equipped with a water circulation facility. Before irradiation, the reaction suspension was ultrasonicated for 5 min and stirred in the dark for 60 min to ensure an equilibrium between adsorption and desorption had been reached. During the photocatalytic tests, 5 mL of the suspension was removed at given time intervals, followed by centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 10 min to remove the photocatalyst. The concentration of MO that remained was measured through its absorbance (A) at 465 nm with a Hitachi UV-3010 spectrophotometer. The degradation ratio for MO can be calculated using X = (A0 − At)/A0 × 100%, where A0 and At are the concentration of MO before illumination and after an illumination time t.
2.4 Photoelectrochemical measurements
The photocurrent measurements were carried out in a standard electrode photoelectrochemical cell using an electrochemical workstation (CV-27, BAS). The as-prepared sample, platinum-gauze and Ag/AgCl were used as the working, counter and reference electrodes, respectively. A sodium sulfate solution (0.5 M) was used as the electrolyte. The light for the photocurrent measurements was filtered light (λ > 400 nm, 150 mW cm−2) from a PLS-SXE 300UV Xe lamp.
3. Results and discussion
In this work, a novel In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composite was successfully synthesized via a facile chemical precipitation method without any surfactant. Irregular Ag2CrO4 nanoparticles were tightly attached to the surfaces of In2S3 nanoplates, which was beneficial for facilitating the transfer of photogenerated charge carriers and thus improving the photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes.
3.1 XRD analysis
The crystallinity and phase integrity of the as-prepared samples were examined using an XRD technique. Fig. 1 illustrates the XRD patterns of pure Ag2CrO4 and the In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composites with a different In2S3 content, together with that of pure In2S3. In the pattern of the bare Ag2CrO4, Bragg diffraction peaks occur at 2θ = 21.7°, 31.1°, 31.4°, 32.3°, 33.7°, 39.3°, 44.3°, 45.4°, 52.1°, 55.8°, 57.1° and 61.9°, which can be undoubtedly indexed to the (120), (031), (211), (002), (131), (122), (240), (222), (400), (242), (213) and (431) crystal planes of orthorhombic Ag2CrO4 (JCPDS Card No. 26-0952).16a,b,31 No impurity phase can be detected. The considerably strong and sharp diffraction peaks indicate that the as-obtained Ag2CrO4 product is well-crystalline and manifest that pure orthorhombic Ag2CrO4 is formed under the utilized synthesis conditions. In addition, as for the pure In2S3, Bragg diffraction peaks occur at 2θ = 22.4°, 27.5°, 29.6°, 33.3°, 47.7° and 51.4°, which can be assigned to the (107), (109), (215), (0012), (2212) and (415) crystal planes of tetragonal β-In2S3 (JCPDS Card No. 25-0390), which is in agreement with the reported literature.29c,32 Compared to the XRD pattern of blank In2S3, remarkably, no apparent diffraction peaks of In2S3 can be discerned for the In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composites, which can probably be ascribed to the fact that the low amount and good dispersion of the In2S3 nanoflakes in the In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composites cannot be detected through XRD analysis. Besides, it is worthwhile to note that the addition of In2S3 nanoplates did not change the diffraction peak positions of the Ag2CrO4 in the In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composites compared with the XRD pattern of blank Ag2CrO4. Moreover, in order to further verify the existence of In2S3, the In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composite was further examined using XPS, SEM, HRTEM and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analyses.

3.2 XPS analysis
In order to investigate in-depth the surface compositions and chemical states of the as-obtained In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composites and analyze the interactions between In2S3 and Ag2CrO4, pure Ag2CrO4 and the In2S3(4.0 wt%)/Ag2CrO4 composite were analyzed using XPS and the results are shown in Fig. 2. It is worth noting that the XPS peak of C 1s at 284.6 eV can be ascribed to an adventitious carbon-based contaminant, and the binding energy of the C1s peak of 284.6 eV was used as a reference for calibration. Fig. 2a exhibits the XPS survey spectra of pure Ag2CrO4 and the In2S3(4.0 wt%)/Ag2CrO4 composite. As expected, the pure Ag2CrO4 contains Ag, Cr and O elements, while the In2S3(4.0 wt%)/Ag2CrO4 composite is composed of Ag, Cr, O, In and S elements, which is consistent with the chemical composition of the as-obtained In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composite. In order to obtain more insight into the chemical bonding between the Ag, Cr, O, In and S atoms in the as-obtained composite, high resolution In 3d, S 2p, Ag 3d, Cr 2p and O 1s XPS spectra for the pure Ag2CrO4 and In2S3(4.0 wt%)/Ag2CrO4 composite were deconvoluted using XPSPEAK41 software with mixed Gaussian–Lorentzian functions (Gaussian/Lorentzian ratio of 80/20) after subtraction of the linear-type background (Fig. 2b–f). The peak-fitting procedure used a minimum number of peaks consistent with the best fit, with consideration of the peak position, full width at half-maximum (FWHM), and area (Table 1). For the In 3d spectra, the two distinct peaks located at 444.8 eV and 452.3 eV can be assigned to In 3d5/2 and In 3d5/2, respectively,30,33 suggesting the presence of In3+. For the S 2p spectra, the two weak peaks located at 161.6 eV and 162.8 eV can be ascribed to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively,33,34 indicating the presence of S2−. It is worth noting that the spin–orbit separations of In and S were found to be 7.6 and 1.3 eV, demonstrating that In and S are present as In3+ and S2− in the In2S3(4.0 wt%)/Ag2CrO4, respectively.29a,c Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 2d, the Ag 3d high resolution XPS spectrum of the In2S3(4.0 wt%)/Ag2CrO4 composite could be deconvoluted into two conspicuous peaks with binding energy values of 367.7 eV and 373.8 eV, corresponding to characteristic peaks of Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2, respectively,16a,c,18,35 suggesting the presence of Ag+ within Ag2CrO4. As shown in Fig. 2e, the Cr 2p high resolution XPS spectrum of the In2S3(4.0 wt%)/Ag2CrO4 composite could be deconvoluted into two conspicuous peaks with binding energy values of 578.7 eV and 588.0 eV, which can be attributed to characteristic peaks of Cr 2p3/2 and Cr 2p1/2, respectively,36 indicating the presence of Cr6+ within Ag2CrO4. As shown in Fig. 2f, the O 1s high resolution XPS spectrum of the In2S3(4.0 wt%)/Ag2CrO4 composite could be deconvoluted into two conspicuous peaks with binding energy values of 529.9 eV and 531.4 eV, corresponding to the lattice oxygen,37 which are related to the Cr–O chemical bonding in In2S3(4.0 wt%)/Ag2CrO4. More importantly, it can be seen that the binding energy for the Ag 3d peak of In2S3(4.0 wt%)/Ag2CrO4 shows a slight positive shift, while the Cr 2p and O 1s peaks exhibit a negative shift in comparison with the spectra of pure Ag2CrO4. Such a shift can be ascribed to interactions between closely connected phases of In2S3 and Ag2CrO4, implying that heterojunctions have been formed in the as-synthesized In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composite, which was further studied using HRTEM (Fig. 3d). Consequently, all these findings distinctly confirm the coexistence of In2S3 and Ag2CrO4 in the as-prepared In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composites.

3.3 Microstructure analysis
The morphologies, microstructures and chemical compositions of the as-prepared samples were investigated using SEM, HRTEM and EDS analyses. The SEM image in Fig. 3a illustrates that the pure In2S3 sample is composed of stacked and irregular plate-like nanostructures. Fig. 3c displays that the morphology of the pristine Ag2CrO4 sample consists of stacked and irregular particle-like nanostructures with smooth surfaces. As shown in Fig. 3b, it was clearly seen that a number of Ag2CrO4 nanoparticles had grown well on the surfaces of the stacked In2S3 nanoplates, which indicated that a particle-on-plate structure had possibly formed between the Ag2CrO4 nanoparticles and In2S3 nanoplates, implying successful coupling of Ag2CrO4 and In2S3. It is worth mentioning that the in situ growth should establish intimate contact between the Ag2CrO4 and In2S3, which facilitates better photogenerated charge carrier transfer and separation in comparison with solely Ag2CrO4. In order to further illuminate the formation of the In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composite and confirm the intimate contact between Ag2CrO4 and In2S3, HRTEM analysis was performed. Obviously, the junction displayed two types of clear lattice fringes as depicted in Fig. 3d. For one set of the clear fringes, the spacing was ca. 0.32 nm, corresponding to the (109) lattice spacing of the tetragonal phase of β-In2S3.29c For the other set of the clear fringes, the spacing measured ca. 0.28 nm, which is in accordance with the (211) lattice plane of orthorhombic phase Ag2CrO4.16a,b Thereby, this manifested the formation of a heterojunction structure between Ag2CrO4 and In2S3, which is beneficial for separation of the photogenerated charge carriers and thus improves the photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, in order to investigate the elemental composition of the as-prepared samples, energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) was performed, as can be seen from Fig. 3e. It can be unambiguously observed that the existence of In, S, Ag, Cr and O elements in the In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composites had been proved, which is consistent with the above XPS analysis.

In order to further verify the elemental distribution of the as-prepared In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composites, SEM-EDS elemental mapping of the In2S3(4.0 wt%)/Ag2CrO4 sample was conducted by operating the SEM in scanning mode. As can be seen from Fig. 4b–f, it was clearly revealed that the In, S, Ag, Cr and O elements were distributed homogeneously and had the same shape and locations in the In2S3(4.0 wt%)/Ag2CrO4 composite, confirming the coexistence of In2S3 and Ag2CrO4 in the In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composite. Therefore, based on the above XPS, SEM, HRTEM, EDS and elemental mapping results, there was solid evidence that the In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composites had been successfully formed and developed.

3.4 BET analysis
It is well known that the BET specific surface area is commonly considered as an important influencing factor for the photocatalytic performance of a photocatalyst.1b Generally, photocatalytic degradation is an interfacial reaction, and a large BET specific surface area can provide more adsorption sites for organic dyes. The adsorption of organic dyes onto the surface of a photocatalyst is usually considered as the initial step in the decomposition of organic dyes, so increasing the contact opportunities between the organic dye and photocatalyst would finally result in excellent removal of the dye.1a,23 As a consequence, in order to determine the specific surface areas of the as-obtained samples, nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were obtained and the results are depicted in Table 2 and Fig. 5. It can be found that the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of all the samples were type IV isotherms with H3 hysteresis loops, according to the Brunauer–Deming–Deming–Teller (BDDT) classification,38 demonstrating that the as-obtained samples have mesoporous structures. Furthermore, the BET specific surface area of the In2S3 was 40.2 m2 g−1, which is much higher than that of Ag2CrO4 (1.7 m2 g−1). More importantly, with the increasing content of In2S3, the BET specific surface area increased remarkably compared to that of the pure Ag2CrO4, which was induced by the inclusion of the high surface area of In2S3.

3.5 UV-vis DRS analysis
The photoabsorption properties of a semiconductor are key factors that influence its photocatalytic performance, and are related to the energy band structure of the semiconductor.1b Hence, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS) was employed to illustrate the photoabsorption properties of the as-prepared samples. Fig. 6 presents UV-vis DRS spectra of the pure Ag2CrO4, In2S3 and In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composites. As shown in Fig. 6a, it can be easily seen from the absorption wavelengths that the pure In2S3, Ag2CrO4 and In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composites displayed strong absorption from the UV light to visible light regions, implying the possibility of photocatalytic activity using these materials under visible light irradiation. Concretely, the pure In2S3 exhibited an intense absorption band with a steep edge at about 640 nm, while the pure Ag2CrO4 showed a broad fundamental absorption edge at about 720 nm, presenting a light-absorbing ability across nearly the entire visible light region. Additionally, the absorption edges of the In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composites shifted regularly to longer wavelengths with increase of the In2S3 content due to the strong visible light response of In2S3, and the absorption intensity of the In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composites increased gradually with the increasing content of In2S3 in the visible light region, which may be attributed to the interactions and synergetic effects between In2S3 and Ag2CrO4 in the In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composites. From the above results, it can be concluded that the existence of In2S3 in the In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composites would result in the composites exhibiting efficient utilization of visible light and high photocatalytic activities.

Besides, it is known that the band gap energy (Eg) of a semiconductor can be calculated using the following formula:26,39αhν = A(hν − Eg)n/2, where A, α, ν, Eg and h are a constant, the absorption coefficient, the light frequency, the band gap energy and Planck’s constant, respectively. As for the value of n, it was determined by the type of optical transition of the semiconductor (n = 1 for direct transition and n = 4 for indirect transition). According to previous literature, the n value of In2S3 is 1,29d,40 while the n value of Ag2CrO4 is 4.16a,b,31b,41 Accordingly, by applying the above equation, the band gap energy of In2S3 was estimated to be around 1.92 eV, according to a plot of (αhν)2versus energy (hν), while the band gap energy of Ag2CrO4 was estimated to be about 1.72 eV, according to a plot of (αhν)1/2versus energy (hν) (Fig. 6b). All the values for the band gaps of Ag2CrO4 and In2S3 are in accordance with previously reported results.16b,33
3.6 PL and photocurrent analysis
The separation efficiency for photogenerated charge carriers of a semiconductor is another pivotal factor that influences its photocatalytic performance. Thus, evidence for the separation efficiency for photogenerated charge carriers was obtained using photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra, because the recombination of excited electrons and holes gives rise to a PL emission signal,1a and PL analysis is an effective and commonly used method that is extensively employed to detect the separation, transfer and recombination processes of photoinduced electron–hole pairs in a semiconductor.42 It is generally believed that a weaker PL intensity means a higher separation probability for the photogenerated charge carriers, revealing a lower recombination rate of the charge carriers and thus resulting in higher photocatalytic activity. Fig. 7a presents the PL spectra of the bare Ag2CrO4 and In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composites at room temperature, which were obtained using an excitation wavelength of 270 nm. It was clearly found that the PL emission spectra of the In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composites showed main peaks at similar positions but with different intensities, and the intensities were much lower than those of pure Ag2CrO4, indicating that photoinduced electron–hole pairs could be efficiently separated in the In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composites after the introduction of In2S3 due to the matching band potentials. Interestingly, the PL intensity did not always decrease with increase of the In2S3 content. It can be seen that the In2S3(4.0 wt%)/Ag2CrO4 composite exhibits the lowest PL intensity, which indicates that it shows a higher separation efficiency and the highest photocatalytic activity compared to the other composites. In addition, the PL intensities of the as-prepared samples follow the order: In2S3(4.0 wt%)/Ag2CrO4 < In2S3(6.0 wt%)/Ag2CrO4 < In2S3(2.0 wt%)/Ag2CrO4 < Ag2CrO4, suggesting that an excess of In2S3 species increased the recombination rate of the photogenerated charge carriers, leading to an inferior photodegradation efficiency. This arises as the excess In2S3 species may act as recombination centres and thereby reduce the efficiency of charge separation.
 Fig. 7  PL spectra (a) and transient photocurrent responses (b) of pure Ag2CrO4 and the In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composites. 
Furthermore, in order to provide further convincing evidence for the efficient separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs in the as-prepared In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composites, the interfacial charge transfer dynamics between In2S3 and Ag2CrO4 were examined through photocurrent analysis, as the photoelectrochemical performance is widely considered as efficient evidence for demonstrating the photogenerated electron–hole pair separation and transfer efficiency of composite photocatalysts.21 Generally, the corresponding relationship is that a higher photocurrent implies a higher electron–hole separation efficiency, thus leading to a higher photocatalytic activity.43 Consequently, we recorded the transient photocurrent responses of the pure Ag2CrO4 and In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composites under dark conditions and visible light irradiation. Fig. 7b shows a comparison of the photocurrent–time curves for the bare Ag2CrO4 and In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composites, with two on-off intermittent irradiation cycles. As shown in Fig. 7b, it is clear that the photocurrent densities rapidly decreased to zero as soon as the lamp was turned off, and that the photocurrent densities maintained stable values when the lamp was turned on, indicating a rapid photocurrent response to the on–off intermittent irradiation. It can be obviously seen that the photocurrent responses of the In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composites were increased significantly in comparison with that of pure Ag2CrO4, indicating a higher separation and transfer efficiency of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs under visible light irradiation, and hence higher photocatalytic activity. Additionally, it is worth noting that the photocurrent density first increases, then declines along with the increasing content of In2S3, which is in good accordance with the above PL results. This provides further evidence to support the above PL results. Hence, the abovementioned results obviously confirm the superior charge transfer and recombination inhibition in the In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composites in comparison with only Ag2CrO4, demonstrating that the introduction of In2S3 could effectively enhance the separation and transfer efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs in Ag2CrO4, which could improve the photocatalytic performance.
3.7 Photocatalytic activity and stability
In order to compare the photocatalytic activities of Ag2CrO4 before and after it was coupled with In2S3, a series of photocatalytic degradation experiments were performed using methyl orange (MO) molecules in aqueous solution as a model pollutant under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). Before irradiation, the suspensions of MO over the as-prepared samples were ultrasonically dispersed for 5 min and stirred in the dark for 60 min to obtain an adsorption–desorption equilibrium. As presented in Fig. 8a, a MO solution without any photocatalysts was irradiated under visible light for 120 min, and the concentration showed no obvious decrease, indicating that the MO molecules are relatively stable and the self-photolysis process can be ignored, implying that degradation of MO with the as-prepared photocatalysts will be mainly due to photocatalysis. Simultaneously, for the purpose of comparison, the photocatalytic activities of Ag2CrO4 and pure In2S3 were also investigated under identical conditions. It was obviously observed that only about 18.1% and 31.1% of the MO dye molecules could be decomposed with the individual Ag2CrO4 and In2S3 samples after visible light irradiation for 120 min, respectively, indicating that both Ag2CrO4 and In2S3 showed a weak MO degradation capability. This may be attributed to a fast recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs with the single photocatalysts. Strikingly, all the In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composites with a different content of In2S3 showed an appreciably much higher photocatalytic efficiency for the photodegradation of MO in comparison with the individual Ag2CrO4 and In2S3 samples, it is reasonable to conclude that the enhanced photocatalytic activity could be attributed to effective interfacial charge transfer and separation between the In2S3 and Ag2CrO4. Moreover, it is easy to observe that the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of the In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composites firstly increased along with the increasing content of In2S3, and then decreased when the mass ratio of In2S3 reached 6.0 wt%. It is worth noting that the In2S3(4.0 wt%)/Ag2CrO4 composite exhibited the best photocatalytic performance (65.3%) of the as-prepared samples, whose photodegradation activity was 3.6 and 2.1 times higher than those of pure Ag2CrO4 and In2S3, respectively. These changes in the photocatalytic activity could be understood through considering synergetic effects of the light absorption and the Z-scheme nature of the In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composite. At first, when the In2S3 content was relatively low (<4.0 wt%), the contact area between the In2S3 and Ag2CrO4 gradually increased with increment of the In2S3 content, and the visible light absorption of In2S3/Ag2CrO4 strengthened and more electron–hole pairs were generated. Meanwhile, an effective charge separation can be achieved through the Z-scheme electron transfer between In2S3 and Ag2CrO4, resulting in enhancement of the photocatalytic activity and the inhibition of photocorrosion. Alternatively, when the In2S3 content was relatively high (ca. 6.0 wt%), the effective contact area did not increase significantly whereas the excess In2S3 species could act as recombination centers for electron–hole pairs, leading to the separation efficiency of the electron–hole pairs being decreased and further restraining of the photocatalytic activity, which is well consistent with the above PL and photocurrent analysis. As a result, it is obvious that the amount of In2S3 has a significant influence on the photocatalytic activities of the In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composites, and it is crucial to control the mass ratio of In2S3 in the composites to gain the best photocatalytic performance.
 Fig. 8  Photocatalytic activities (a) and first-order kinetic plots (b) for the photodegradation of MO in aqueous solution over the as-prepared samples under visible light irradiation. 
Additionally, in order to obtain a better comparison of the photocatalytic efficiencies of the as-prepared samples, an apparent pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics model was applied to evaluate the experimental data, as expressed in the following equation:44 −ln(C/C0) = kt, where C0 is the equilibrium concentration of MO after 60 min of adsorption in the dark, C is the MO concentration remaining in the solution at irradiation time t (min), and k is the apparent first-order rate constant. The apparent first-order rate constant was obtained from the slopes of a −ln(C/C0) versus time t plot.45 As displayed in Fig. 8b, the plots of the irradiation time (t) against −ln(C/C0) were all nearly straight lines and the correlation coefficients obtained were more than 0.98, demonstrating that the photocatalytic degradation curves fit well with the first-order kinetics equation model. The corresponding photodegradation rate constants were calculated to be 0.0016 min−1, 0.0031 min−1, 0.0055 min−1, 0.0087 min−1 and 0.0068 min−1 for Ag2CrO4, In2S3, In2S3(2.0 wt%)/Ag2CrO4, In2S3(4.0 wt%)/Ag2CrO4 and In2S3(6.0 wt%)/Ag2CrO4, respectively. Obviously, it can be seen that the In2S3(4.0 wt%)/Ag2CrO4 composite exhibited the highest apparent rate constant for MO degradation among all the samples, which was approximately 5.4 times higher than that of individual Ag2CrO4 and 2.8 times larger than that of pure In2S3, which is consistent with the conclusions from the photocatalytic degradation experiments and in agreement with the PL and photocurrent analysis. The improved photocatalytic activity was attributed to combined effects, including stronger visible absorption and higher charge separation efficiency with the In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composite through the formation of a Z-scheme between In2S3 and Ag2CrO4. All of the above results illustrate that the constructed Z-scheme In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composite has a much greater photocatalytic activity in the degradation of MO than those of individual Ag2CrO4 and In2S3 samples, implying that the synergistic effects existing between Ag2CrO4 and In2S3 play an important role in preventing the direct recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, thus improving the photocatalytic activity.
Apart from the photocatalytic performance, it is rather crucial to evaluate the stability and recyclability of a photocatalyst from the viewpoint of practical application. Therefore, to evaluate the stability and reusability of the In2S3(4.0 wt%)/Ag2CrO4 composite, circulating runs for the photocatalytic degradation of MO were carried out under identical conditions, and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. 9a–c. After each run, the recycled catalyst was separated from the aqueous suspension using centrifugation, repeatedly washed with deionized water and ethanol, and dried under vacuum at 55 °C for 24 h. As presented in Fig. 9a, the photocatalytic activity of the In2S3(4.0 wt%)/Ag2CrO4 composite remained above about 79% of its original activity and the composite still exhibited an enhanced photocatalytic performance compared with individual In2S3 and Ag2CrO4 after 4 successive recycling runs, suggesting adequate reusability and stability during the photocatalytic degradation of MO dyes under visible light irradiation. The decline in the photocatalytic activity might be mainly ascribed to the following two factors. Firstly, it might be partly caused by incomplete collection of the photocatalyst during the recovery step. Secondly, it might be attributed to the inevitable partial reduction of Ag+ to Ag0 on the surface of the Ag2CrO4 during the photocatalytic reaction process under visible light irradiation, because Ag2CrO4 is easily photocorroded by photogenerated electrons and decomposed to weakly active metallic Ag, resulting in its instability and inferior photocatalytic activity. As a consequence, in order to elucidate the existence of metallic Ag in the used In2S3(4.0 wt%)/Ag2CrO4 sample, XRD and XPS analysis were carried out. As shown in Fig. 9b, it can be seen that there were no extra characteristic diffraction peaks observed, implying that no obvious crystalline structure changes could be observed in the XRD pattern of the In2S3(4.0 wt%)/Ag2CrO4 sample after the fourth successive experimental run. It is noteworthy that there was not a new weak peak located at 2θ = 38.1° corresponding to the (111) plane diffraction of Ag (JCPDS Card No. 89-3722),4,46 although this may be attributed to the low amount of Ag on the on the surface of Ag2CrO4 not being detected through XRD analysis. On the other hand, as depicted in Fig. 9c, compared to the fresh In2S3(4.0 wt%)/Ag2CrO4 sample, the Ag 3d spectrum of the used In2S3(4.0 wt%)/Ag2CrO4 sample displayed two new and very weak peaks at about 368.5 eV and 374.7 eV corresponding to Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2, respectively, which belong to Ag0,16b,c demonstrating that a tiny amount of metallic Ag was indeed formed during the process of the photocatalytic reaction. However, according to the above results, the In2S3(4.0 wt%)/Ag2CrO4 composite showed a relatively high stability. This may be attributed to the following probable reasons: the metallic Ag nanoparticles formed during the process of the photocatalytic reaction are possibly very tiny and well dispersed over the surface of the Ag2CrO4, which means they can serve as excellent acceptors to trap photogenerated electrons,18,47 thus the photogenerated electrons of Ag2CrO4 could be quickly transferred to the metallic Ag nanoparticles and then recombined with the photogenerated holes of In2S3 through the Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism, resulting in prolongation of the lifetime of the photogenerated electrons in the conduction band (CB) of Ag2CrO4 and the photogenerated holes in the valence band (VB) of In2S3 and facilitating a good separation efficiency for the photogenerated electron–hole pairs. In this way, the further formation of more metallic Ag nanoparticles during the photocatalysis process was effectively prevented, and thereby the photocorrosion of Ag2CrO4 was inhibited, which is similar to the situation with previously reported In2O3/Ag2CrO4,16b GO/Ag2CrO416c and Ag3PO4/Ag/WO3−x47c composite photocatalysts. Consequently, these observations demonstrate that the presence of In2S3 can not only improve the visible light photocatalytic performance of Ag2CrO4, but can also inhibit photocorrosion of the Ag2CrO4 during the photocatalysis process, resulting in enhancement of the stability of the Ag2CrO4.

3.8 Possible photocatalytic mechanism
As is known, several kinds of active species including superoxide radicals (˙O2−), hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) and holes (h+) are generated and considered as the major reactive species in the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants under visible light irradiation due to their strong oxidation capacities.28,48 Therefore, in order to gain insight into the reaction mechanism and to identify and ascertain the contributions of the active species, a series of control experiments involving quenching of the active species were conducted to ascertain the dominant reactive species during the photodegradation of MO under visible light irradiation. In the present work, tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH), triethanolamine (TEOA) and 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ) were chosen as ˙OH, h+ and ˙O2− scavengers, respectively.35,49 As indicated in Fig. 9d, when t-BuOH was added into the reaction solution, the photodegradation rate of MO was almost unaltered compared to that without scavengers, implying that ˙OH is not the main active species. On the contrary, when TEOA or BQ was added into the reaction solution, the photodegradation rate of MO was seriously inhibited, meaning that h+ and ˙O2− play an important role in the degradation of MO under visible light irradiation. Thus, it can be deduced that the photocatalytic degradation of MO over the as-prepared In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composite is mainly governed by ˙O2− and h+, rather than ˙OH, under visible light irradiation.
Furthermore, the band edge positions of the CB and VB of a semiconductor also play a crucial role in determining its photocatalytic activity.39a Therefore, in order to further explain the enhanced photocatalytic activity mechanism with the In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composite, the band edge positions of the VB and CB potentials of In2S3 and Ag2CrO4 were estimated according to the following empirical equations:26,50EVB = X − Ee + 0.5Eg and ECB = EVB − Eg, where EVB and ECB are the valence band and conduction band edge potentials, respectively, X is the absolute electronegativity of the semiconductor, which is the geometric mean of the electronegativities of the constituent atoms, Ee is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (about 4.5 eV vs. NHE) and Eg is the band gap of the semiconductor. According to previous literature reports, the values of χ for Ag2CrO4 and In2S3 are 5.86 eV16a,b,31b and 4.69 eV,33 respectively. Based on the results in Fig. 6b, the band gap energies of Ag2CrO4 and In2S3 were estimated to be 1.72 eV and 1.92 eV, respectively. Thus, given the equations above, the ECB and EVB of Ag2CrO4 were estimated to be 0.50 eV and 2.22 eV respectively, while the ECB and EVB of In2S3 were estimated to be −0.77 eV and 1.15 eV, respectively. The results are consistent with previously reported results.16b,33 Obviously, the CB and VB edge potential positions of In2S3 are more negative than those of Ag2CrO4. The charge carriers of the In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composite photocatalyst may transfer in accordance with the traditional band–band transfer model, which is a common electron–hole separation process for a great number of composite photocatalysts.46,51 Through this channel, the photogenerated electrons would transfer from the CB of In2S3 to that of Ag2CrO4 as the CB position of In2S3 is more negative than that of Ag2CrO4. Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes would transfer from the VB of Ag2CrO4 to that of In2S3 as the VB position of In2S3 is more negative than that of Ag2CrO4. Unfortunately, the enriched electrons in the CB of Ag2CrO4 cannot reduce O2 to yield ˙O2−, as the position (0.50 eV) of the CB of Ag2CrO4 is less negative than the standard redox potential of O2/˙O2− (−0.33 V vs. NHE).20,52 So it is not favorable for formation of the active species ˙O2−, and leads to an inferior catalytic activity. However, from the above radical trapping experiment results, it is clear that ˙O2− is the major active species in the In2S3/Ag2CrO4 photocatalytic system, and the photocatalyst exhibits a higher photocatalytic activity. Accordingly, we hereby conclude that charge transfer in the as-prepared In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composite occurs via a Z-scheme mode under our experimental conditions.
On the basis of the above experimental results and discussion, the In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composite follows a typical Z-scheme transfer system rather than a traditional band–band transfer system, and a plausible mechanism and a schematic drawing of the electron–hole separation process were proposed to explain the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composite. As illustrated in Fig. 10, under visible light irradiation, both In2S3 and Ag2CrO4 are excited, and the photogenerated holes and electrons are in their conduction and valence bands, respectively. The photogenerated electrons in the CB of Ag2CrO4 can easily shift into the Ag nanoparticles through the Schottky barrier because of the more positive Fermi energy of Ag compared to the CB level of Ag2CrO4. So In2S3/Ag2CrO4 transforms to In2S3/Ag/Ag2CrO4 in the early stage of the photocatalytic reaction because of the photosensitization of Ag2CrO4. Meanwhile, the holes in the VB of In2S3 can also shift into the Ag nanoparticles, due to the more negative Fermi energy of Ag compared to the VB level of In2S3. In the photocatalytic process, Ag nanoparticles at the interface of the In2S3/Ag/Ag2CrO4 can act as recombination centers for the electrons from the CB of Ag2CrO4 and holes from the VB of In2S3, effectively inhibiting electron–hole pair recombination in both In2S3 and Ag2CrO4, and enhancing interfacial charge transfer. In this way, the photogenerated electrons and holes can be efficiently separated, resulting in the recombination of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs being remarkably hindered, which further leads to enhanced photocatalytic activity. On the other hand, the electrons in the CB of In2S3 with a more negative potential have a strong reduction power, whereas the holes in the VB of Ag2CrO4 display a strong oxidation ability. Subsequently, the highly reducing electrons located in the CB of In2S3 can transfer to the surface and be annihilated by surface absorbed acceptors like O2 to produce ˙O2−, as the position (−0.77 eV) of the CB of In2S3 is more negative than the standard redox potential of O2/˙O2− (−0.33 V vs. NHE). The produced ˙O2− species can oxidize the MO to degradation products. Similarly, the highly oxidizing holes located in the VB of Ag2CrO4 can transfer to the surface and directly oxidize the MO to degradation products, due to the high positive potential of the EVB of Ag2CrO4. This can be confirmed from the above-mentioned active species trapping experiments, and PL and photocurrent analyses. Similar Z-scheme mechanisms for other composite photocatalysts, such as AgI/Ag3PO4,53 In2O3/Ag2CrO4,16b g-C3N4/Ag3PO4,54 Ag/Fe3O4/g-C3N4,43 Ag/Ag3PO4/Bi2MoO6,55 Ag3PO4/Ag/SiC,50b and so forth, have been reported. As a result, a more highly stable In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composite is present and it shows a better photocatalytic performance on treatment with MO than that of In2S3 or Ag2CrO4.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, a series of Z-scheme In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composite photocatalysts were successfully constructed using a facile chemical precipitation method. The as-obtained In2S3/Ag2CrO4 composites exhibited a strongly enhanced photocatalytic performance compared to individual Ag2CrO4 and In2S3 samples during the degradation of methyl orange under visible light irradiation. In particular, the optimal rate constant of the In2S3(4.0 wt%)/Ag2CrO4 composite with a theoretical weight content of 8.0% In2S3 for the photodegradation of MO was 2.8 and 5.4 times higher than those of individual In2S3 and Ag2CrO4, respectively. The enhanced photocatalytic activity could be ascribed to the formation of a Z-scheme system between In2S3 and Ag2CrO4, which resulted in a higher efficiency for charge carrier separation and transfer, and the electrons in the conduction band of In2S3 with a high reduction ability and the holes in the valence band of Ag2CrO4 with an oxidation ability participated in the photocatalytic reaction. This work may be useful for rationally designing new types of Z-scheme photocatalysts and provides some illuminating insights into the Z-scheme transfer mechanism for application in energy conversion and environmental remediation.
