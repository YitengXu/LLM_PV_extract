    , Accepted 30th November 2015First published on 1st December 2015AbstractThe photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of Cu2S nanowire arrays (NWAs) has been demonstrated to be greatly enhanced by dipping-assembly of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) on the surfaces of Cu2S NWAs. Experimental results show that the pristine Cu2S NWAs with higher aspect ratios exhibit better PEC performance due to the longer length scale for light absorption and the shorter length scale for minority carrier diffusion. Importantly, the CQDs decorated Cu2S NWAs exhibit remarkably enhanced photocurrent density, giving a photocurrent density of 1.05 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. NHE and an optimal photocathode efficiency of 0.148% under illumination of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2), which is 4 times higher than that of the pristine Cu2S NWAs. This can be attributed to the improved electron transfer and the energy-down-shift effect of CQDs. We believe that this inexpensive Cu2S/CQD photocathode with increased photocurrent density opens up new opportunities in PEC water splitting.
Introduction
Due to the growing global energy consumption and increasing concern for environmental issues, solar water splitting for hydrogen production has attracted significant attention as a method for generating carbon-free fuels from solar energy.1 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is one of the most attractive approaches to produce hydrogen in an eco-friendly manner with no carbon emission, which requires only semiconductor electrodes, water and sunlight.2–5 Since the pioneering work by Fujishima and Honda in the early 1970s,6 PEC water splitting using semiconductor materials such as photoelectrodes has been intensively studied to obtain efficient solar-to-hydrogen conversion in the past forty years. While much attention has been devoted to photoanode materials (e.g., TiO2, ZnO, Fe2O3, WO3),7–12 the development of the PEC tandem cell is limited by the identification of stable and inexpensive p-type photocathode materials.13 Furthermore, they are advantageous over the n-type ones in terms of hydrogen generation as the photo-generated electrons can be directly injected into the electrolyte on the p-type semiconductors and thus directly reduce water to hydrogen at the semiconductor/water interface without potential energy loss.14
As a p-type semiconductor with metal vacancies in the lattice, Cu2S has an indirect band gap of 1.2 eV, which can be considered as an ideal sunlight absorbing material for solar cells and corresponds to a maximum theoretical efficiency of 30%.15,16 Historically, the CdS/Cu2S heterojunction photovoltaic devices reached efficiencies near 10%, which had been competitive with planar silicon-based photovoltaics.17,18 Although the bandgap of Cu2S is too small to split water, this inexpensive, earth-abundant and industrial mature semiconductor has many attractive features as a photocathode material for PEC water splitting, including a suitable bandgap that enables much solar light absorption and a conduction band energy level suitable for hydrogen generation.19,20 Compared with those of bulk materials, it is known that semiconductor nanowire arrays (NWAs) have the capability of independently modulating an actual carrier diffusion length and light absorption depth and the advantages of enhanced light trapping, reduced light reflection, improved band gap tuning, facile strain relaxation and increased structure defect tolerance.21,22 These advantages indicate that the NWA geometry is an ideal structure to resolve the mismatch between the short minority carrier diffusion length and the longer light absorption length in Cu2S by decoupling these directions.23,24 Moreover, compared to the thin film and bulk structure, the NWAs have higher specific surface areas, thus increasing the electrode/electrolyte interface for electrochemical reactions in PEC water splitting.25,26 Therefore, the Cu2S NWAs may eventually lead to the overall goal of highly efficient and scalable PEC photocathodes.
To date, various methods have been used to synthesize the Cu2S NWAs.27–30 Among them, the gas–solid reaction is considered as a cost-effective, easily scaled-up method to prepare large-area Cu2S NWAs on a Cu foil or film substrates.31 In the reaction, the NWAs are self-grown from a Cu substrate without any catalysts or templates at room temperature.29–31 The Cu foil or film as a precursor can promote the growth of Cu2S NWAs and also be used as an electrode when the Cu2S NWAs are applied to PEC cells.29 Yang et al.20 first investigated the PEC performance of Cu2S NWAs grown on a Cu foil, and demonstrated that the cathodic photocurrent of 0.11 mA cm−2 at −0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl can be increased to 0.14 mA cm−2 by coating a CdS shell layer on the nanowire surface. Ren et al.31 showed that the diameters and lengths of Cu2S nanowires had a great impact on the light absorption abilities. However, the influence of morphology of the self-grown Cu2S NWAs on the PEC performance has not yet been systematically investigated. Additionally, the photocurrent of the CdS nanoparticles decorated Cu2S NWA photocathode is still too low to compete with other NWA photocathodes (e.g., Cu2O and CuO).14,25
Recently, carbon quantum dots (CQDs) have been widely used to modify semiconductor nanostructures such as Si nanowires,32,33 Cu2O microspheres,34 TiO2 nanostructures,35–39 BiVO4 inverse opal structures,40 SrTiO3 nanoparticles,41 and Bi2O3 inverse opal structures,42 by which the photocatalytic and photoelectric properties can be remarkably enhanced due to the strong size and excitation wavelength-dependent photoluminescence behaviour, broad band optical absorption, and high electrical conductivity of CQDs.43 Enlightened by this, it is easy to come up with the idea of improving the PEC performance of Cu2S NWAs by attaching CQDs.
Herein, we report the self-growth of the Cu2S NWAs on a Cu foil surface and the dipping-assembly of CQDs on the Cu2S NWAs as photocathodes. CQDs were used as sensitizers to enhance the PEC performance of Cu2S NWAs. To obtain an optimal template for CQDs modification, the influence of nanowire morphology on the PEC performance of Cu2S NWA photocathode was investigated. The effect of CQD loading on the surfaces of Cu2S nanowires was also investigated to optimize the photocurrent and its stability. An energy band diagram was also proposed to help illustrate the working mechanism of the improved PEC performance for the Cu2S/CQD NWA photocathode.
Experimental
Synthesis of Cu2S NWAs
The Cu2S NWAs were synthesized by using the gas–solid reaction method. Firstly, a Cu foil (99.9% purity, ∼4 × 4 cm) was carefully polished with abrasive paper (2000 mesh) and ultrasonically washed using deionized water and ethanol. The cleaned Cu foil was then placed into an airtight stainless steel reactor to perform the gas–solid reaction (as shown in Scheme S1†). Secondly, a mixed gas of H2S and O2 at a volume ratio of 2:1 was introduced into the reactor for 1 min, which was then sealed and kept at a fixed temperature of 20–30 °C for different times. As the Cu surface became black and fluffy, dense Cu2S NWAs were grown on the surface.
Synthesis of Cu2S/CQD NWAs
The Cu2S/CQD NWAs were fabricated by assembling CQDs on the surfaces of Cu2S NWAs via a dipping-assembly method,33 as shown in Scheme 1. A certain volume of CQD solution (detailed synthesis process and properties of CQDs are given in the ESI†)44 was dropped on the surfaces of Cu2S NWAs (0.5 ml cm−2), which was then dried in a vacuum at 80 °C for 2 hours. The cycle times were used to control the amounts of CQDs, and the Cu2S/CQDs-x NWAs were obtained, where x represents the deposition cycles of CQDs.

Characterization
The morphologies of the samples were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Carl Zeiss Ultra 55, Germany) operating at 20 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100, JEOL, Japan) operating at 200 kV was used to observe the microstructures of the samples. The crystalline structure of the samples was analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using an advanced X-ray diffractometer (D8 ADVANCE, Bruker, Germany) in the diffraction angle range 2θ = 20–60°, with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154056 nm) at a voltage of 40 kV and a current of 40 mA. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were acquired using a Japan Kratos Axis UltraDLD spectrometer with a monochromatic Al Kα source (1486.6 eV).The UV-vis-NIR absorption and diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were recorded using a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Lambda 950, PerkinElmer, USA). The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-4600, Hitachi, Japan). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a VERTEX 70 spectrometer (Bruker, Germany). The Raman spectra were acquired by using a dispersive Raman microscope (Senterra R200-L, Bruker Optics, Germany), operated with a 532 nm laser.
PEC measurements
To perform the PEC tests, the Cu substrates of the NWAs were connected to an enamelled Cu wire through high-purity silver conducting paint. To prevent photocurrent leakage, the edges and backside of samples were sealed using epoxy resin, excluding an area of 1.0 cm2 for absorbing the light. For easy measurement, the samples were fixed on glass slides by epoxy resin. A three-electrode PEC cell using a 200 mL aqueous solution of 1.0 M KCl (pH = 5.97) was used to carry out the current density measurements. The sample as the working electrode (WE), Pt net as the counter electrode (CE) and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) as the reference electrode (RE) were the three electrodes in the PEC cell. Illumination was provided by a solar simulator (CHF-XM500, Beijing Perfectlight) using a 500 W xenon lamp and equipped with an AM 1.5G filter. Light power intensity was maintained at 100 mW cm−2 at the sample position. An electrochemical workstation (CHI 650E) was used to measure the current–voltage characteristics of the photocathodes under chopped light irradiation (light on/off cycle: 5 s), with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The PEC stability of the samples was evaluated by measuring the photocurrent densities produced under chopped light irradiation (light on/off cycle: 5 s) at a fixed electrode potential of −0.25 V vs. Ag/AgCl (0.2 V vs. RHE).
The measured potentials versus the Ag/AgCl RE were converted to the RHE scale via the Nernst equation:ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 pH + E0where ERHE is the converted potential versus RHE, EAg/AgCl is the experimental potential measured against the Ag/AgCl RE, and E0 is the standard potential of Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) at 25 °C (i.e., 0.197).
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in the Nyquist plot of the samples was performed in 1.0 M KCl aqueous solution at open circuit potential. The amplitude of the sinusoidal wave was set at 5 mV, and the frequency varied from 10 kHz to 0.1 Hz.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the typical morphologies of the Cu2S NWAs at different temperatures. It can be concluded that the relatively lower reaction temperature results in smaller average diameter, larger average length, higher density and darker sample colour. For example, the Cu2S NWAs prepared at 20 °C possess an average diameter of 88 nm and an average length of 28 μm, whereas those prepared at 30 °C have an average diameter of 200 nm and an average length of 4.3 μm. It is also found that lower temperature (20–25 °C) is beneficial to the formation of base-tapered nanowires (Fig. 1a3–c3). Furthermore, prolonging the reaction time can also be used to prepare Cu2S nanowires with long lengths and large diameters (Fig. S2†). The detailed relationship between the preparation conditions (reaction temperature and time) and the diameter, length and spacing density of the Cu2S NWAs is presented in Table S1.† The results suggest that both relatively lower reaction temperature and longer reaction time are beneficial to the growth of Cu2S nanowires with high aspect ratios.

The XRD patterns of the Cu2S NWAs grown at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 2. The diffraction peaks can be indexed as monoclinic Cu2S (JPCDS no. 33-0490). The EDS result (Fig. S3†) shows that the nanowires are composed of Cu, S, and O, indicating the existence of CuxO (x = 1, 2), which is confirmed by Raman analysis (Fig. S4†).45–47

The TEM image of a single Cu2S nanowire is shown in Fig. 3a, exhibiting its rough surface and a diameter of ∼56 nm. From the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 3b), it can be clearly seen that the nanowire surface is covered with a thin CuxO layer having a thickness of ∼6 nm and low crystallinity to form a core/shell nanowire structure. The calculated lattice spacing of the core is ∼0.67 nm corresponding to the interplanar distance of the (02) crystal plane of monoclinic Cu2S, which is consistent with that reported elsewhere for the Cu2S nanowires using the same method.29–31 The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (inset, Fig. 3b) confirms that the Cu2S single crystallinity is oriented along the (02) direction.

As shown in Fig. 4, all Cu2S NWAs synthesized at different temperatures show excellent light absorption abilities over a wide range of wavelengths from 250 to 850 nm. The Cu2S NWAs grown at lower reaction temperatures exhibit better light absorption, which can be ascribed to the longer lengths and base-tapered morphologies.31,48 The Cu2S NWAs prepared at 20 °C exhibit 93.1–99.7% absorbance over the wavelength range of 250–850 nm. The average absorbance can reach 99.2% at 550 nm wavelength. This excellent light trapping ability can be attributed to not only the geometry of Cu2S NWAs but also to their optimal bandgap for light absorption. As shown in the insets of Fig. 4 and S5,† the bandgap of Cu2S NWAs is estimated to be ∼1.25 eV, which is larger than that of the corresponding bulk material (1.20 eV). The result is consistent with the previously reported Cu2S NWAs using the same method.31 On one hand, the naturally formed CuxO shell layer can increase the bandgap of Cu2S nanowires probably due to its relatively larger bandgap (Eg (CuO) = 1.4 eV, Eg (Cu2O) = 2.0 eV)14,25 than Cu2S. On the other hand, the increased surface-to-volume ratio of Cu2S NWAs compared with the planar structure will result in an increased CuxO amount.

Although the Cu2S NWAs with high aspect ratios exhibit better light absorption ability, they are easy to fall over after dipping-assembly of CQDs (Fig. S6†). For this reason, we chose NWAs grown at 25 °C as templates to fabricate Cu2S/CQD NWAs. Fig. 5a shows a typical SEM image of Cu2S NWAs after dipping-assembly of CQDs for 4 cycles. It can be observed that the tips of adjacent nanowires are aggregated together by CQDs (Fig. 5b). The FTIR (Fig. 5c) and EDS spectra (Fig. S7†) confirm the formation of Cu2S/CQD NWAs. However, the traces of CQDs cannot be distinguished from the image due to the resolution limit of SEM. The TEM image (Fig. 5d) of the Cu2S/CQDs-4 nanowires shows that the CQDs have been successfully decorated on the surfaces of Cu2S nanowires as the nanoparticle sizes are consistent with that of the pristine CQDs (3–9 nm, Fig. S1a†). The HRTEM image (Fig. 5e) demonstrates that the monocrystalline Cu2S core was uniformly coated by a thin CuxO shell layer with a thickness of ∼10 nm and low crystallinity, and traces of CQDs marked by the white dotted round frames can be observed. From the HRTEM image of the top of a Cu2S/CQDs-4 nanowire (Fig. 5f), many amorphous CQDs can also be found. Furthermore, the EDS elemental mapping (Fig. 5g–j) for a segment of Cu2S/CQDs-4 nanowire suggests that the CQDs are evenly distributed on the surfaces of the Cu2S nanowires.

XPS was used to further characterize the Cu2S/CQDs-4 NWAs as shown in Fig. 6. The deconvoluted C 1s region (Fig. 6a) shows different carbon functionalities. The typical peaks at 284.7, 285.8 and 288.3 eV can be attributed to the C–C/CC, C–O and O–CO bonds, respectively.49 The peaks at 530.3 and 531.5 eV in the deconvoluted O 1s XPS spectrum are assigned to the Cu–O and C–O, respectively (Fig. 6b). The XPS spectra of Cu 2p (Fig. 6c) and S 2p (Fig. 6d) suggest the co-existence of CuO and Cu2O on the surfaces of Cu2S nanowires.31

Although the CQDs possess excellent abilities to absorb ultraviolet light (Fig. S1c†), there is no big difference between Cu2S and Cu2S/CQDs-4 NWAs in light absorption (Fig. S8†). There are two possible reasons for this phenomenon: one is that the aggregation of adjacent nanowires will lead to light absorption deterioration of NWAs, which can be compensated for by the CQDs. The other one is that the influence of CQDs on the improvement of light absorption may be covered by that of Cu2S NWAs as they also exhibit excellent light trapping ability in the ultraviolet region.
The PEC measurements were carried out in a three-electrode configuration with the NWA photocathode (Fig. S9†), Ag/AgCl electrode, and Pt net as the WE, RE and CE, respectively, as illustrated in Fig. 7a and b. Fig. 7c shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves in the dark and under illumination for the Cu2S NWAs grown at 25 °C. It can be seen that the NWAs exhibit obvious photocurrent under light illumination, implying that efficient charge generation and separation happened at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. When the illumination is chopped with a frequency of 0.2 Hz during the LSV scan, the dark and light currents could be simultaneously monitored, as shown in Fig. 7d. Obviously, the absolute photocurrent decreases as bias potential decreases.

(e) LSV curves of the Cu2S NWAs prepared under different conditions under chopped illumination. (f) Amperometric I–t curves of the corresponding samples at 0.2 V vs. RHE under chopped illumination. 
As shown in Fig. 7e, all Cu2S NWAs prepared at different temperatures exhibit higher photocurrent responses than the Cu2S film prepared using the same method. In addition, the Cu2S NWAs with higher aspect ratios prepared at lower temperatures demonstrate better PEC performance. The enhanced photocurrent density can be ascribed to the fact that the increased light absorption results in the generation of more photo-generated carriers and the decreased nanowire diameter is more favourable for electron transfer. Fig. 7f illustrates the transient current density under chopped illumination for the corresponding samples at 0.2 V vs. RHE, exhibiting good switching behaviour and stability of Cu2S NWAs. The photocurrent density of Cu2S NWAs can reach 0.175 mA cm−2, which is about 9 times larger than that of the film sample (0.02 mA cm−2), demonstrating the superiority of NWA geometry.
The effect of the amount of CQDs on the PEC performance of Cu2S/CQD NWAs was also investigated by changing the assembling cycles. Fig. 8a shows the LSV curves of the Cu2S/CQDs-4 NWAs in the dark and under illumination. It is obvious that the photocurrent has been greatly increased compared with that of the pristine Cu2S NWAs (Fig. 7a). The maximum photocurrent of the Cu2S/CQDs-4 NWAs at 0 V vs. RHE has reached 1.05 mA cm−2, which is about 4 times larger than that of the Cu2S NWAs (0.26 mA cm−2). The LSV curve of the Cu2S/CQDs-4 NWAs under chopped illumination also confirms the greatly enhanced photocurrent response, as shown in Fig. 8b. The photocathode current overshoots in the beginning of switching the light on which can be ascribed to the accumulation of photogenerated carriers at the interface between composite nanowires and electrolytes.50 The enhanced photocurrent demonstrates that the CQDs are good acceptors for electron transfer from the nanowire to electrolyte.34,49Fig. 8c shows the photocurrent of Cu2S/CQDs-x photocathodes with different assembling cycles (x = 1, 2, 4 and 8), and the corresponding absolute photocurrent densities are calculated as shown in Fig. S10.† The results indicate that the photocurrent densities of the Cu2S/CQD photocathodes first increase with increasing amounts of CQDs and reach a peak at 4 cycles before declining thereafter. The deteriorated PEC performance for the NWAs with thicker CQD layers (Cu2S/CQDs-8) can be ascribed to the hindered electron migration.14,39

(d) Amperometric I–t curves of the Cu2S and Cu2S/CQDs-4 NWAs at 0.2 V vs. RHE under chopped illumination. (e) Photocurrent densities and stabilities (measured at 0.2 V vs. RHE) of the Cu2S/CQDs-x NWAs as a function of deposition cycle of CQDs. (f) Photoconversion efficiencies vs. applied bias potential for the Cu2S/CQDs-x NWAs. 
The stability of the photocathodes under illumination is evaluated by chronoamperometric measurements at 0.2 V vs. RHE in chopped light with a frequency of 0.2 Hz over 400 s. The stability is quantified as the percentage of the photocurrent density at the end of the last light cycle compared with that at the end of the first cycle within the 400 s measurement period. A close comparison of the photocurrent density decay curves of the pristine Cu2S and Cu2S/CQDs-4 NWA photocathodes is presented in Fig. 8d. Compared with the stability of 87.5% for the Cu2S NWA photocathode, the Cu2S/CQDs-4 NWA photocathode shows a slightly decreased stability of 82.1%. To investigate the reason for the deteriorated stability, the photocurrent stability of other Cu2S/CQD NWA photocathodes was also characterized (Fig. S11†). The results are summarized in Table S2† and presented in Fig. 8e. Obviously, the Cu2S/CQDs-1 NWAs exhibit a slightly increased stability of 90.9% compared with that of pristine Cu2S NWAs, indicating that CQDs themselves can improve the stability of NWAs. However, when the deposition cycle of CQDs is increased to 2, the stability of Cu2S/CQDs-2 is greatly decreased to 81.8%, which may result from the poor physical adsorption ability between the assembled CQDs in the electrolyte.51 Further increasing the deposition cycle of CQDs, the stability can be improved to 82.1% for Cu2S/CQDs-4 NWAs and 87.9% for Cu2S/CQDs-8. The results indicate that an optimal CQD layer on Cu2S nanowires can be used to improve the photocurrent and maintain the relatively high stability as well.
The photoconversion efficiencies of the Cu2S/CQD NWA photocathodes were calculated with the following equation of η = JV/Pin,14,52 where J and V are the photocurrent density (Fig. S10†) and photovoltage (V vs. RHE) and Pin (mW cm−2) is the incoming light flux (100 mW cm−2). Fig. 8f presents the plots of the photoconversion efficiencies versus applied bias potentials for the Cu2S/CQD NWAs. It can be observed that all Cu2S/CQD NWAs show greatly enhanced photoconversion efficiencies compared with the pristine Cu2S NWAs. Their optimal conversion efficiencies are summarized in Table S2.† As a result, the Cu2S/CQDs-4 NWAs exhibit the highest conversion efficiency of 0.148%, which is about 4 times larger than that of the pristine Cu2S NWAs (0.035%).
After 30 min PEC the water splitting process at 0.2 V vs. RHE, the surfaces of Cu2S and Cu2S/CQDs-4 nanowires became rougher as a result of photocorrosion (Fig. S12a1 and b1†). The increase in oxygen (Fig. S12a2 and b2†) demonstrates that CuxO nanoparticles may form on the surfaces of nanowires. Although the Cu2S/CQDs-4 NWAs exhibit improved ability against photocorrosion compared with the pristine Cu2S NWAs, the main challenge to use the Cu2S/CQD NWAs for practical hydrogen production is long-term stability since both the Cu2S nanowires and the assembled CQDs are not stable over a long time.21,51
Impedance measurements were also performed to study the enhanced PEC properties of the Cu2S/CQD NWAs.40Fig. 9 presents the Nyquist plots of the Cu2S and Cu2S/CQDs-4 NWAs in the dark and under illumination. All Nyquist plots display a semicircle at high frequencies whose diameter represents the charge transfer resistance (Rct), which controls the electron transfer kinetics of the redox probe at the electrode interface.14 The straight line at low frequency is related to the diffusion process. The corresponding equivalent circuit is depicted in the inset of Fig. 9, where Rs denotes the bulk resistance, originating from the electrolyte and the electrode, CPE is the constant phase element that models capacitance of the double layer, and W stands for the Warburg impedance originated from the diffusion process at the electrode surface. It is evident that the Rct in the dark is larger than that under light illumination for both kinds of photocathodes. Additionally, the Cu2S/CQD photocathode shows a lower Rct value than the pristine Cu2S photocathode both in the dark and under illumination. The fitting results of Rct for the Cu2S/CQDs-4 NWAs in the dark and under illumination are 665.1 and 70.1 Ω cm2, respectively, which are smaller than the corresponding values of the pristine Cu2S NWAs (992.0 and 94.6 Ω cm2 in the dark and under illumination, respectively). The results demonstrate that the CQDs facilitate the electron transfer from Cu2S nanowires to the electrolyte, and the reduced Rct is also correlated to the enhanced PEC performance.

The PEC water splitting mechanism and charge transfer process in the Cu2S/CQD NWA photocathode can be illustrated in Scheme 2. As both the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) of Cu2S are higher than those of CuO, a type-II heterostructure of Cu2S/CuO can form to promote the separation of the photo-generated carriers.53–56 Although the CBM of Cu2O is just a little higher (0.25 eV) than that of Cu2S,53,54 it is reasonable to expect Cu2O to have electron accepting properties for the Cu2S/Cu2O heterostructure because conduction band barriers smaller than 0.3–0.4 eV do not impose a problem for current transport in the ∼1.2 eV band gap devices.57,58 Additionally, the Cu2O/CuO has also been demonstrated to be an efficient type-II heterostructure for electron transfer.55,59 Consequently, the Cu2S/CuxO heterojunction should be efficient for PEC water splitting. Moreover, the CQDs in Cu2S/CQD NWAs play dual important roles for the improved PEC performance. Firstly, under illumination, the decorated CQDs serve as electron sinks that suppress the recombination of photo-generated carriers and then facilitate the electron transfer from Cu2S/CuxO to the electrolyte to reduce water and form H2 under the external bias potential. Secondly, the CQDs possess excellent abilities to absorb ultraviolet light (Fig. S1c†). On one hand, the corresponding photo-generated electrons can be used to reduce water directly. On the other hand, the excited-state CQDs can emit longer wavelength light as a result of down conversion (Fig. S1d†),60 which in turn excites Cu2S to form electron/hole pairs to some extent, which also participate in PEC water splitting.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a photocathode design for PEC water splitting by the dipping-assembly of CQDs on the Cu2S NWAs. Experimental results show that the Cu2S NWAs with higher aspect ratios show relatively higher PEC performance. More importantly, decorating the Cu2S NWAs with CQDs can further enhance the photocurrent density, and the Cu2S/CQD NWAs show an optimal PEC performance, producing a photocurrent density of 1.05 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. NHE and an optimal photocathode efficiency of 0.148%, which is 4 times higher than that of the pristine Cu2S NWAs. This enhancement can be ascribed to the improved electron transfer and the energy-down-shift effect of CQDs. This Cu2S/CQD NWA photocathode promises to have a great potential in the construction of low-cost and high performance PEC cells.
