    , Accepted 28th October 2015First published on 28th October 2015AbstractMethylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) based solar cells have shown impressive power conversion efficiencies of above 20%. However, the microscopic mechanism of the high photovoltaic performance is yet to be fully understood. Particularly, the dynamics of CH3NH3+ cations and their impact on relevant processes such as charge recombination and exciton dissociation are still poorly understood. Here, using elastic and quasi-elastic neutron scattering techniques and group theoretical analysis, we studied rotational modes of the CH3NH3+ cation in CH3NH3PbI3. Our results show that, in the cubic (T > 327 K) and tetragonal (165 K < T < 327 K) phases, the CH3NH3+ ions exhibit four-fold rotational symmetry of the C–N axis (C4) along with three-fold rotation around the C–N axis (C3), while in the orthorhombic phase (T < 165 K) only C3 rotation is present. At around room temperature, the characteristic relaxation times for the C4 rotation are found to be τC4 ≈ 5 ps while for the C3 rotation τC3 ≈ 1 ps. The T-dependent rotational relaxation times were fitted with Arrhenius equations to obtain activation energies. Our data show a close correlation between the C4 rotational mode and the temperature dependent dielectric permittivity. Our findings on the rotational dynamics of CH3NH3+ and the associated dipole have important implications for understanding the low exciton binding energy and a slow charge recombination rate in CH3NH3PbI3 which are directly relevant for the high solar cell performance.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites are transforming the solar cell research field, having rapidly reached a photovoltaic power conversion efficiency of above 20%1,2 after only five years since the first report.3 High photovoltaic efficiency requires three ingredients; a bandgap well-matched with the solar spectrum, a large light absorption coefficient and a long charge carrier diffusion length. The most extensively studied hybrid perovskite, CH3NH3PbI3, has been shown to possess these three features; a bandgap of 1.6 eV,4,5 a large extinction coefficient of greater than 104 cm−1,6 and a long electron–hole diffusion length in the range of hundreds of nanometers for polycrystalline thin films to greater than 175 microns for single crystals.7–11 In addition to these favorable characteristics, CH3NH3PbI3 exhibits several peculiar optoelectronic properties that are relevant to photovoltaic performance – a giant increase (3 orders of magnitude) in the dielectric constant upon light illumination,12 an extremely slow photoconductivity response13 and the possible existence of ferroelectric domains.14 The microscopic mechanism of the high photovoltaic performance and these properties is yet to be fully understood.
Among proposed microscopic pictures, one scenario is based on the presence of nanoscale ferroelectric domains due to the alignment of organic CH3NH3+ cations with the electric dipole15–19 and the rearrangement of the inorganic scaffold that is intimately linked with the CH3NH3+ ion orientation.13,19–21 The ferroelectric domains provide internal electric field and separate photogenerated electrons and holes, thus reducing the probability of their recombination. This has been invoked to explain the slow charge recombination22,23 and long charge diffusion lengths10,11 However, ferroelectricity in CH3NH3PbI3 is still being actively debated – while some studies indicate the presence of ferroelectricity,14,24–26 other studies have found that CH3NH3PbI3 does not show permanent electric polarization at room temperature.27,28 Another microscopic mechanism currently being investigated is the ionic conduction where charged species readily move in CH3NH3PbI3 to create space charge regions.27,29–32 This mechanism is likely to be the main cause of the current–voltage hysteresis observed in some solar cells,33 with strong evidence recently obtained from switchable electric polling in a planar device that is independent of CH3NH3PbI3 layer thickness.32 The ion conduction mechanism has also been invoked to explain some of the peculiar dielectric behaviors mentioned above. These different microscopic pictures may have varying significance depending on the properties under consideration and sample preparation methods.
Whether the ferroelectricity in CH3NH3PbI3 at room temperature exists or not, the orientation and dynamics of CH3NH3+ ions are thought to critically impact various properties relevant for solar cell performance such as the light-induced giant dielectric constant increase,12 picosecond dielectric relaxation,34 slow charge recombination,23,35 electronic structure18,35 and low (a few meV) exciton binding energy.36–38 Currently, there is no consensus on the microscopic mechanism for these behaviors due to the lack of a full understanding of the atomic structure and dynamics of CH3NH3PbI3. Recently, Leguy et al.39 have reported quasi-elastic neutron scattering studies with a limited data range and analysis which led to results that are inconsistent with previous experimental results obtained by millimeter-wave spectroscopy,34 nuclear magnetic resonance,40,41 as well as theoretical prediction with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations.18,35,42 This calls for accurate and in-depth studies on the dynamics of CH3NH3+ ions to advance the understanding of the rich behavior of CH3NH3PbI3.
We have performed elastic and quasi-elastic neutron scattering to probe rotational motions in CH3NH3PbI3 covering the full range of relevant regions in energy (ℏω) and momentum (Q) phase space over a wide range of temperature, 370 K ≥ T ≥ 70 K, covering the three different structural phases of CH3NH3PbI3. Our comprehensive data enabled us to employ a group theoretical method based on the crystal symmetry to understand the nature of the rotations of the CH3NH3+ cation, including their symmetries, the relaxation times as a function of temperature, and the activation energies. Our results show that, in the cubic (T > 327 K) and tetragonal (165 K < T < 327 K) phases, the CH3NH3+ ions exhibit four-fold rotational symmetry of the C–N axis (C4) along with three-fold rotation around the C–N axis (C3), while in the orthorhombic phase (T < 165 K) only C3 rotation is present. We show that the onset of C4 rotation at 160 K, upon heating, is well correlated with bulk properties such as a sudden jump in dielectric permittivity.43 Around room temperature, the characteristic relaxation times for the C4 rotation are found to be τC4 ≈ 5 ps while for the C3 rotation τC3 ≈ 1 ps. The T-dependent rotational relaxation times were fitted with Arrhenius equations to obtain activation energies. Intriguing shifts in activation energies as a function of crystal symmetry were found.
Experimental
Materials
The following chemicals were used as received: 33% methylamine in ethanol, hydroiodic acid (57% by weight in water), ethanol, diethyl ether, lead iodide (PbI2) (99.999%) from Sigma Aldrich and cesium iodide (CsI) (99.999%) from Alfa Aesar. Methylammonium iodide was synthesized by following a method in the literature.44 CH3NH3PbI3 and CsPbI3 were synthesized via solution crystallization by mixing methylammonium iodide or CsI with PbI2 in aqueous hydrogen iodide solution and slowly evaporating the liquids via heating in ambient air. 13.5 g of CH3NH3PbI3 and 16.4 g of CsPbI3 powder samples were obtained for neutron scattering measurements.
Neutron scattering measurements
The crystal structure and structural parameters at 4 K were determined by neutron powder diffraction (NPD), using a BT1 diffractometer at the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) located in Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA. The wavelength was selected using a Cu(311) monochromator with an in-pile 60′ collimator (λ = 1.5398 Å). The scattered neutrons were collected by 32 3-He detectors over the 2θ range of 1.3°–166.3° with a 0.05° step size. The CH3NH3PbI3 (8 g) sample was placed into a cylindrical vanadium can in a dry helium box. The vanadium can was sealed with an indium o-ring. The residual helium inside the vanadium can was removed using a turbo molecular pump prior to diffraction experiments, and the sample can was mounted in a closed cycle helium refrigerator.
Time-of-flight neutron scattering measurements on the polycrystalline sample of CH3NH3PbI3 on a Disk-Chopper-Spectrometer (DCS)45 and a High Flux Backscattering Spectrometer (HFBS)46 were performed at the NCNR. At DCS, energy of incident neutrons was fixed to Ei = 3.55 meV (wavelength λ = 4.8 Å) with an energy resolution of 0.1 meV at the elastic channel. At HFBS, energy of scattered neutrons was fixed to Ef = 2.08 meV (λ = 6.271 Å) with an energy resolution of 1 μeV. In both experiments, the sample was mounted in a closed cycle helium refrigerator.
Results
Quasi-elastic scattering from CH3NH3PbI3

Fig. 1 shows quasi-elastic scattering from CH3NH3PbI3 measured at four different temperatures with DCS. At 370 K in the cubic phase, there is a broad peak centered at Q ∼ 1.5 Å−1 and ℏω = 0 meV. Upon cooling into the tetragonal phase, as shown at 260 K and 180 K, the peak becomes narrow in energy resulting in the strong signal at low energies. Upon further cooling to 130 K in the orthorhombic phase, the strong low energy signal moves to much lower energies and most of it falls into the energy window of the instrumental energy resolution of 0.1 meV. The color-coded surfaces are the results of two-dimensional global fits of the data with models of rotational motions of the CH3NH3+ molecule in the respective local environments of the crystal structures, which will be described in detail later.
 Fig. 1  Quasi-elastic scattering from CH3NH3PbI3. Neutron scattering intensity is shown as a function of momentum (Q) and energy (ℏω) transfers, measured (a) at 370 K, (b) at 260 K, (c) at 180 K, and (d) at 130 K. The data were taken using a Disk-Chopper Time-of-Flight Spectrometer, DCS. Open white circles are the data, and the color coded surface is the surface image of the model calculated quasi-elastic intensity described in the text. 
In order to visualize better the quasi-elastic and elastic signals, we integrated the data over three different energy ranges, −0.1 < ℏω < 0.1 meV, 0.2 < ℏω < 0.4 meV, and 0.8 < ℏω < 1.0 meV and plotted their Q-dependences, I(Q), in Fig. 2. For −0.1 < ℏω < 0.1 meV (see Fig. 2(a)), there are several sharp nuclear Bragg peaks. In addition, each T data set exhibits a prominent broad peak that is strong at low Q values and falls off as Q increases. At high Q values (Q ∼ 2 Å−1), I(Q) is almost zero for 370 K. However, the high Q signal increases gradually upon cooling from the cubic phase (370 K) into the tetragonal phase (down to 180 K); see the data of 300 K (orange), 260 K (green) and 180 K (blue). Upon further cooling, I(Q) becomes strong even at high Q values when the crystal structure becomes orthorhombic (130 K), resulting in its slow decrease with increasing Q; see the data in violet.
 Fig. 2  Constant energy cuts of the CH3NH3PbI3 neutron scattering data. Q-dependencies of the neutron scattering intensity for three different energy regions of (a) −0.1 < ℏω < 0.1 meV, (b) 0.2 < ℏω < 0.4 meV, and (c) 0.8 < ℏω < 1.0 meV are plotted for five different temperatures. Circles are the energy-integrated data, and the lines are based on the C4⊗C3 jump model (solid) and the isotropic rotational model (dotted) as described in the text. The line is color-coded according to temperature; 370 K (red), 300 K (orange), 260 K (green), 180 K (blue) and 130 K (violet). 
For the 0.2 < ℏω < 0.4 meV and 0.8 < ℏω < 1 meV energy windows (Fig. 2(b) and (c), respectively), I(Q) is peaked at Q ∼ 1.5 Å−1 at 370 K. Upon cooling down to 180 K, I(Q) gradually shifts to higher Q and becomes peaked at Q ∼ 2 Å−1 at 180 K. Upon further cooling, more prominent changes occur; at 130 K the peak position seems to have moved to Q higher than 2 Å−1, and I(Q) becomes weak especially for 0.8 < ℏω < 1 meV. The weak intensity at 130 K over these energy windows is consistent with the strong enhancement of the intensity in the energy window of −0.1 < ℏω < 0.1 meV (see Fig. 2(a)). These indicate that dramatic changes occur when the system enters the orthorhombic phase.
Models for rotational motions of CH3NH3+
Let us now explain the models that we have considered to explain the DCS data. As shown in Fig. S2 of the ESI,† the quasi-elastic scattering is absent in CsPbI3. This means that the scattering is due to motions of CH3NH3+ that is located at the center of the cuboctahedral cage formed by the neighboring 12 iodide atoms. Due to the strong incoherent neutron scattering amplitude of hydrogen atoms, neutron scattering measurements provide a superb sensitivity toward probing dynamics of CH3NH3+. By analyzing the Q and ℏω dependent scattering intensities, the nature of the hydrogen motion can be determined.47
An isotropic rotational model for CH3NH3+
We have first considered an isotropic model for rotational motions of CH3NH3+47 (1)where e−〈u2〉Q2 is the Debye Waller factor, 〈u2〉 is the mean squared displacement, r is the radius of the object involved with the rotations, jl(Qr) is the lth spherical Bessel function, and  is the relaxation time for the rotation with an angular momentum number l. This isotropic model describes hydrogen atoms randomly moving on the surface of a sphere. The best fits to the data are shown as the dotted lines in Fig. 2. Terms with l higher than 5 were ignored because jl>52(Qr) becomes negligible. For 370 K (cubic phase), the model fits reasonably well with riso = 1.17(8) Å and τ = 1.62(2) ps suggesting that the molecule undergoes nearly random rotations at 370 K. We note that riso is less than the radius of the CH3NH3+ molecule, 1.49(2) Å, which suggests that there exist other rotational modes with smaller length scales than the rotation of the entire molecule. For 300 K in the tetragonal phase, the isotropic rotation model also reproduces the data reasonably well with τ = 2.33(3) ps. The increasing τ with decreasing T is consistent with the expected energy softening of the rotational motions. For T < 300 K, however, the discrepancy between the model and the data becomes apparent; at 260 K and 180 K the model calculation falls off faster with increasing Q than the data for −0.1 < ℏω < 0.1 meV. Also, most notably, the model produces stronger intensity for 0.2 < ℏω < 0.4 meV and weaker scattering for 0.8 < ℏω < 1 meV than the data. At 130 K in the orthorhombic phase, the failure is clearly seen in I(Q, −0.1 < ℏω < 0.1 meV). The inadequacy of the isotropic model indicates that the rotational motions of CH3NH3+ have some preferred directions in the tetragonal phase. Also, the obtained riso being less than the radius of the CH3NH3+ molecule suggests that there are multiple rotational modes which the isotropic model cannot distinguish. Therefore, a more refined model is required for better analysis.
Introduction to jump models47
The rotation model that accounts for the existence of a preferential molecular orientation is called a jump model.47 Since the CH3NH3+ molecule is located inside the cuboctahedral cage, its rotational motions are restricted by its own symmetry as well as by the local crystal symmetry of the cage. The possible rotational modes can be accounted for by the irreducible representations of the direct product of the symmetry of the local crystal environment (C) and that of the molecule (M); Γ = C⊗M. Here we consider proper rotations only and do not consider improper rotations such as inversion and mirror reflection. Since this group theory has been extensively described in many textbooks including ref. 47, we will state here only the basic formalism that is necessary for our discussion. In the group theory, the static and dynamic structure factor for rotational motions of molecules embedded in a crystal can be written as47 (2)where the sum over γ runs over all the irreducible representations of Γ, Γγ. For a polycrystalline sample, Aγ(Q) is given by (3)Here g is the order of Γ and lγ is the dimensionality of Γγ. The sums over α and β run over all the classes of C and M, respectively, and the sums over Cα and Mβ run over all the rotations that belong to the crystal class, α, and to the molecule class, β, respectively. The characters of Γγ, χαβγ, are the products of the characters of CγC and MγM, χαγC, and χβγM, respectively; χαβγ = χαγCχβγM. j0(x) is the zeroth spherical Bessel function and, |R − CαMβR|, called the jump distance, is the distance between the initial atom position R, and final atom position CαMβR. The relaxation time for the Γγ mode, τγ, can be written in terms of the relaxation times for Cα and Mβ, τα and τβ, respectively, (4)where nα and nβ are the number of symmetry rotations that belong to the classes, α and β, respectively. E and e represent the identity operations of C and M, respectively.
Jump model with Γ = C4⊗C3 for the cubic and tetragonal phases of CH3NH3+
Here we provide the simplest jump models that reproduce our DCS data. For both cubic and tetragonal phases, we used Γ = C⊗M = C4⊗C3 where C4 and C3 represent the four-fold symmetry of the cuboctahedral cage and the three-fold symmetry of the molecule, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3(b). According to a recent neutron diffraction study on the crystal structure,48 the CH3NH3+ cation axis lies in the ab plane in the tetragonal phase, with the long unique axis chosen to be the c-axis (c > a = b), leading to 4-fold and 2-fold symmetry about the c-axis.48 The center of the CH3NH3+ cation is slightly above the center of the cuboctahedral cage as determined by the neutron diffraction, and there is no two-fold symmetry about the a- and b-axes. Thus, the point group of the local crystal environment for the CH3NH3+ cation, C, is C4 rather than the full tetragonal group D4. In the cubic phase, the center of the CH3NH3+ cation moves to the center of the cage, and C becomes O with preferred orientations along all the three principal a-, b-, and c-axes. Our study shows however that the structure factor of the O⊗C3 model basically identical to that of the C4⊗C3 model for the Q ≲ 2 Å−1 range will be necessary in order to distinguish the two models. Thus we will use C4 even for the cubic phase for simplicity and we will see that the model works well for the temperature range that is covered, T < 370 K.
 Fig. 3  Arrhenius plot for CH3NH3PbI3 and the CH3NH3+ cation. (a) Relaxation time, τ, of rotational modes of CH3NH3PbI3 was obtained from fitting the model described in the text to the neutron scattering data at various temperatures that were taken at two different spectrometers, DCS (squares and triangles) and HFBS (circles). Some of these are shown in Fig. 2 and 3, and are plotted against inverse temperature (1/T). The colored solid lines are the fits to  where Ea is an activation energy in unit of meV per one molecule, kB the Boltzmann constant, and A a pre-exponential factor. The colored dotted lines are guides to eyes. The black solid and dotted lines are temperature dependent dielectric permittivity measured by Onoda-Yamamuro et al.43 which show a sharp increase at 160 K (see the main text for more discussions) (b) the CH3NH3+ molecule in the tetragonal environment. There are 12 crystallographically equivalent sites for hydrogen atoms. Since the motions of the two halves of CH3NH3+ can be treated independently in the jump model calculations,49 the H atoms attached to C and N are plotted in an eclipsed configuration rather than the staggered configuration shown in (c) to clearly show the jump distances. (c) The CH3NH3+ molecule in the orthorhombic environment. There are 3 crystallographically equivalent sites for each hydrogen atoms. 
As described in detail in the ESI,† the point group C4 has three irreducible representations, two one-dimensional (A and B) and one two-dimensional (E), and the point group C3 has two irreducible representations, one one-dimensional (A) and one two-dimensional (E). Thus, Γ has six irreducible representations; Γγ = {A⊗A, A⊗E, B⊗A, B⊗E, E⊗A, E⊗E}. It is straightforward to calculate Aγ(Q) and τγ using eqn (3) and (4) (see the ESI,† for details). As summarized in Table 1, there are three different relaxation times, τC4,τC2,τC3, that are associated with the symmetry operations, C4, C2, C3, respectively. The Q-dependence of Aγ(Q) was obtained from the jump distances |R − CαMβR| that were fixed to the values obtained from the crystal structure. For the methyl and ammonium group rotation around the C–N axis, the crystal structure showed 7% difference in hydrogen jump distances. However, the effect of this difference, Δ, on S(Q,ℏω) appears in a quadratic form, Δ2, and becomes negligible within our experimental uncertainty. (For more details, see ESI†) For all our analysis, we have used the average jump distances for the methyl and ammonium groups (Fig. S7, ESI†). The model calculated S(Q,ℏω) was convoluted with the instrumental energy resolution to fit the data. As shown as the color-coded surfaces in Fig. 1 and as the solid lines in Fig. 2, the C4⊗C3 model reproduces the data extremely well over 180 K ≤ T ≤ 370 K spanning the cubic and tetragonal phases. We stress that the fit was carried out globally over the entire Q and ℏω range with only four fitting parameters, an overall factor and the three relaxation times.

The C4⊗C3 model is significantly better than the isotropic model at fitting the data at all temperatures, in particular at lower temperatures. This demonstrates that the CH3NH3+ cation rotates with preferred orientations that are associated with the four-fold crystallographic c-axis, C4, and the three-fold molecular symmetry around the C–N axis, C3. Similar analysis was done for the DCS data taken at seven different temperatures, and the resulting relaxation times are listed in Table 3, and are plotted as a function of 1/T on a log scale in Fig. 3(a) (square and triangular symbols). Upon cooling from 370 K (cubic phase), both ln(τC4) and ln(τC3) increase linearly with 1/T down to about 300 K. Upon further cooling well into the tetragonal phase, however, they exhibit a sudden jump to higher values after which they increase again linearly with 1/T until τC4 reaches 66(2) ps at 180 K. As the system transitions into the orthorhombic phase, the rotation about the four-fold c-axis freezes out.
Jump model with Γ = C3 for the orthorhombic phase of CH3NH3+
In the orthorhombic phase, the orientation of the C–N axis is fixed due to hydrogen bonding between the NH3 and iodide atoms and the resulting lattice distortion.48 Thus C = E, and Γ = E ⊗ C3 = C3. We have tried the C4⊗C3 model but the relaxation times associated with C4 came out to be infinite indicating that the C4 rotation is frozen as expected. Table 2 lists Aγ(Q) and τγ that were calculated for the two irreducible representations of the C3 point group using eqn (3) and (4) (see the ESI,† for details). As shown in Fig. 2, the C3 model with τC3 = 70(6) ps reproduces the 130 K DCS data well.

For T < 130 K, a high flux backscattering spectrometer, HFBS, with a superior energy resolution of 1 μeV was used to study the slower rotation dynamics. Fig. 4 shows the HFBS data taken at five different temperatures, 130 K (red), 112 K (orange), 97 K (green), 82 K (blue), and 70 K (violet). The data were fitted to a sum of a Lorentzian and a Gaussian to account for the broad quasi-elastic peak and the energy resolution limited elastic peak, respectively. The data show that the quasi-elastic peak gets sharper as T decreases, indicating an increase in the relaxation time for the rotational motion. The relation between the half width at half maximum (HWHM) of the Lorentzian and τC3 is given by  where τE is the relaxation time for the motion associated with the two-dimensional E representation of the C3 point group (see Table 2). The best fit values for τC3 are listed for those temperatures in Table 3 and are plotted as circles in Fig. 3(a).

Neutron backscattering data were taken on HFBS at five different temperatures, 130 K (red), 112 K (orange), 97 K (green), 82 K (blue), and 70 K (violet). The data were fitted to a sum of a Lorentzian that accounts for the broad quasi-elastic peak and a Gaussian for the energy resolution-limited elastic peak. The dashed and solid lines are the sum and the Lorentzian, respectively. 
Discussion
Our group theoretical analysis of the neutron scattering data enabled us to separate the dynamics of the rotation of the C–N axis (C4) from the rotation of the H atoms about the C–N axis (C3). In the cubic phase (T > 327 K), our analysis yields τC4 ≈ 3 ps which is close to the previous experimental results obtained by millimeter-wave spectroscopy,34 nuclear magnetic resonance,40,41 as well as theoretical prediction with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations.18,35,42 Upon cooling, both τC4 and τC3 increase exponentially with 1/T (Fig. 3a). Interestingly, both ln(τC4) and ln(τC3) undergo a rapid increase whenever the system enters well into a new crystal structure with a lower symmetry. We can fit each linear region of ln(τ) to the Arrhenius law, , and obtain the activation energy Ea for each rotational mode in each structural phase. The activation energy for the C4 mode, Ea(C4), is 94(13) meV for the cubic phase and 68(9) meV for the tetragonal phase. The activation energy for the C3 rotation, Ea(C3), also decreases from 70(35) meV in the cubic phase to 6(5) meV in the tetragonal phase. Interestingly, the jump in activation energy occurs somewhere between 260–300 K which is below the cubic-tetragonal transition temperature of ∼330 K.50 The cubic-to-tetragonal structural phase change in CH3NH3PbI3 occurs through gradual tilting of the PbI6 octahedra wherein the Pb–I2–Pb angle is the order parameter of the transition. Weller et al. have shown that there is an initial rapid decrease in the Pb–I2–Pb angle from the initial 180 degree as T is lowered from 330 K to ∼280 K. As T is lowered further, the distortion continues but with a much smaller rate as if the distortion has reached an equilibrium state of the tetragonal phase.48 Our results show that the dynamics of the CH3NH3+ ion immediately below the transition temperature is similar to that in the cubic phase. The local environment for the CH3NH3+ including hydrogen bonding interaction with iodide atoms is still similar to the cubic structure since the distortion angle is still small. However, as the Pb–I2–Pb angle becomes ∼165 degrees below 280 K, there is an abrupt change in the interaction between CH3NH3+ and the lead iodide octahedral, and Ea(C4) exhibits a jump. A computational study has found that the orientation of the CH3NH3+ ions and the lead iodide octahedral is strongly correlated19 which supports our results in combination of those of Weller et al.48
As temperature is lowered below the tetragonal-orthorhombic transition temperature of 160 K, the C4 rotation disappears while C3 rotation still exists with Ea(C3) jumping up to 48(3) meV. The disappearance of the C4 mode is in agreement with the previous NMR study that showed that the C–N bond orientation gets frozen in the orthorhombic phase.40 Also, this is in qualitative and quantitative agreement with computational results from Mattoni et al.35 which show freezing of C–N bond rotation below 160 K. It should be noted that the observed temperature dependence of the C4 mode (red symbols in Fig. 3a) coincides with that of dielectric permittivity, ε (black lines in Fig. 3a). Upon heating from low temperatures, there is a sudden increase in ε at 160 K which is exactly the temperature at which the C4 mode gets activated. Moreover, as the relaxation time of C4 decreases upon further heating, ε also decreases. This can be understood as the effect of alignment of the C–N axis and the associated dipole to the external field through the C4 rotation which increases the effective polarizability of CH3NH3PbI3.
In contrast, a recent QENS work reported by Leguy et al.39 does not detect freezing of CH3NH3+ in the orthorhombic phase without clear distinction among rotational modes. Moreover, their relaxation times of 14 ± 3 ps at room temperature and activation energies of 9.9 meV and 13.5 meV are different by several factors from our results as well as previous studies.18,34,41 We think that this is due to the limited range of their data in energy of −0.55 meV < ℏω < 0.55 meV as well as the Q-range of 0.18 Å−1 ≲ Q ≲ 1.8 Å−1 with only five data points which limited their analysis. In contrast to their work, our DCS data cover much larger ℏω and Q ranges, −3 meV < ℏω < 3 meV and 0.11 Å−1 ≲ Q ≲ 2.5 Å−1 respectively, and our HFBS data have a superior energy resolution of 1 μeV, which is ideal for studying dynamics at low temperatures. We would like to emphasize that our comprehensive data and full group theoretical analysis allowed us to understand the nature of the two distinct C4 and C3 rotational modes; in the orthorhombic phase the C4 mode of the C–N axis gets frozen but the C3 rotation of the hydrogen atoms around the C–N axis still exists, which resolves the seemingly contradicting previous results by Leguy et al.39 and other reports.18,34,41
Our results provide important insights into the microscopic mechanism of the high photovoltaic performance of CH3NH3PbI3. For a semiconductor to exhibit high photovoltaic performance, it must have a high exciton dissociation yield, low charge recombination rates and high mobilities. CH3NH3PbI3 possesses a combination of these properties wherein CH3NH3+ ions are thought to play critical roles. In terms of exciton binding energy, previous optical measurements have determined the upper bound to be in the range of ∼50 meV assuming a dielectric constant of 6.5.51–53 However, a recent computational study reported by Even et al.36 has predicted that the appearance of the rotation of CH3NH3+ ions and the associated jump in the dielectric constant above 160 K can significantly lower the exciton binding energy to 1–10 meV. Indeed, several recent experimental studies have confirmed this prediction by performing more accurate measurements of the exciton binding energy in CH3NH3PbI3 at room temperature to be in the range of a few meV.37,38 Consistently, previous studies reported that the dielectric permittivity of CH3NH3PbI3 abruptly jumps at 160 K upon heating43,54 and strong excitonic features that are present below 160 K become suddenly very weak above 160 K.51 Our results clearly show that the C4 mode of CH3NH3+ plays a central role in these behaviors.
Another key reason for the high solar cell performance of CH3NH3PbI3 is its carrier lifetime22,23,55 that is longer than that of other high solar cell performance semiconductors such as GaAs, CdTe and CIGS.56 Previous studies have shown that the charge recombination dynamics in CH3NH3PbI3 under typical solar cell operating conditions are dominated by the interaction of free electrons and holes57,58 which is consistent with the extremely low exciton binding energy.36–38 An intriguing charge recombination behavior of CH3NH3PbI3 is the extremely low bimolecular recombination rate – four orders of magnitude slower55 than the limit set by Langevin theory.59 This slow charge recombination is crucial in achieving the extremely long diffusion length observed in CH3NH3PbI37–11 even with relatively modest charge mobilities55,56 and therefore can be considered to be one of the most important contributors to the high solar cell performance. Microscopically, the slow charge recombination rate in CH3NH3PbI3 can originate from the presence of the CH3NH3+ ions with dipole that causes local fluctuations in energy landscape and nanoscale separation and localization of electrons and holes.15,17–19 Interestingly, our Ea(C4) value of 68(9) meV is remarkably close to the experimental charge recombination activation energy of 75(8) meV determined by time resolved microwave conductance and photoluminescence measurements in the temperature range of 165 K to 300 K.23 The close match between the two activation energies suggests that the rotation of CH3NH3+ ions may be the rate limiting step for the charge recombination process in CH3NH3PbI3.
Conclusions
We revealed in-depth and quantitative information on the motion of CH3NH3+ as a function of temperature as well as crystal symmetry. The rotational rates and activation energies of the CH3NH3+ determined in this work show close relations to various optoelectronic processes and properties reported in the literature such as temperature dependent charge recombination, exciton dissociation and dielectric constant. This suggests that the photovoltaic performance of hybrid perovskites can be tuned by changing the dynamics of organic cations by tuning the structure of the organic cation such as size and dipole moment. Understanding the motions of organic cations is therefore a prerequisite for rational and rapid progress toward photovoltaic device performance optimization as well as the development of novel hybrid perovskites.

 	Fig. 3  Arrhenius plot for CH3NH3PbI3 and the CH3NH3+ cation. (a) Relaxation time, τ, of rotational modes of CH3NH3PbI3 was obtained from fitting the model described in the text to the neutron scattering data at various temperatures that were taken at two different spectrometers, DCS (squares and triangles) and HFBS (circles). Some of these are shown in Fig. 2 and 3, and are plotted against inverse temperature (1/T). The colored solid lines are the fits to  where Ea is an activation energy in unit of meV per one molecule, kB the Boltzmann constant, and A a pre-exponential factor. The colored dotted lines are guides to eyes. The black solid and dotted lines are temperature dependent dielectric permittivity measured by Onoda-Yamamuro et al.43 which show a sharp increase at 160 K (see the main text for more discussions) (b) the CH3NH3+ molecule in the tetragonal environment. There are 12 crystallographically equivalent sites for hydrogen atoms. Since the motions of the two halves of CH3NH3+ can be treated independently in the jump model calculations,49 the H atoms attached to C and N are plotted in an eclipsed configuration rather than the staggered configuration shown in (c) to clearly show the jump distances.
