Electrochemical and photophyscial studies of the dyad in solution have revealed that there is no significant ground-state electronic interaction between the covalently bonded perylene moiety and the fullerene. The photophysical investigations have also shown that there exists an effective photoinduced energy transfer from the perylene moiety to C60. A photovoltaic device made with the dyad has confirmed that photoinduced electron transfer does take place within the dyad; however, the efficiency of the electron transfer is negligible relative to the energy transfer.
Introduction
Since the discovery of a photoinduced electron transfer from a conjugated oligomer and/or polymer to a fullerene, covalently linked C60 dyads have attracted great attention due to their potential application in photovoltaic devices.1,2 However, the disordered islands of polymer and fullerene formed in the actual bulk heterojunction devices limited further improvement of their efficiency.3 To overcome this drawback, fullerene-based double-cable polymers4–10 and donor–acceptor dyads1b,11–18 have been synthesized. As shown recently, the devices made of polythiophene/fullerene blends reached power conversion efficiency values (η) of up to 3.3%.19 Although such high efficiency has been achieved, there is large scope for the further improvement of the solubility for most fullerene compounds.20
Another factor that limits the efficiency is the narrow absorption spectra of the polymers. Many efforts have been devoted to improving the light harvesting ability, but only a few polymers can achieve near infrared (NIR) absorption. Dyes based on 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic diimides (PTCAs) have drawn much attention2c,21 for being used as sensitizers with their outstanding chemical, thermal and photochemical stability. Perylene derivatives are highly absorbing in the visible to NIR region (ε
				≈ 105 M−1 cm−1) and emit fluorescence with a quantum yield of near unity.22 On the other hand, perylene derivatives can be also used as NIR absorber or luminescent materials, and nowadays the highly photo-luminescent and environmentally-stable NIR materials are strongly needed. Besides their conventional uses, perylenes are one kind of key chromophore for high-tech applications, spanning from electronic to biological fields, such as optical switches,23 lasers24 and DNA/RNA probes,25etc. Many types of PTCAs have been synthesized, but the expected low solubility of these molecules is a problem for synthesis, purification and applications in the devices. Therefore, work has shifted to more soluble perylenes.26,27 Wudl and co-workers28 investigated the excited-state properties of a perylene–fulleropyrrolidine dyad with steady-state and femtosecond time-resolved spectroscopy. It was shown that charge separation and energy transfer occurred in nearly equal proportions after photoexcitation and both processes took place on a sub-picosecond timescale. Here, we have designed and synthesized a novel soluble fullerene dyad containing a perylene moiety (C606060–P1 in Scheme 1), in which a perylene moiety is attached to fullerene through a pyrrolidine ring, and which has been prepared by 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of the azomethine ylides generated in situ from the aldehyde and sarcosine. To our knowledge, few works had been reported on good soluble fullerene compounds containing a perylene unit. The structure of the functionalized fullerene dyad was characterized using 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, MS, IR, UV-Vis absorption, luminescence spectra, CV and TGA data. It was found that the fullerene dyad containing a perylene moiety has good solubility in most common organic solvents, high thermal stability and broad visible-light absorption with high coefficients. The electrochemical and excited-state properties of the dyad in solution are discussed using the related perylene derivatives P1
				(see Scheme 1) and fulleropyrrolidine FP
				(see Scheme 2) as reference compounds. Finally, the C606060–P1 dyad was incorporated into a photovoltaic cell by spin-casting the compounds onto an ITO glass substrate and depositing an aluminium film on the top.

Results and discussion
The synthetic route of functionalized fullerene C606060–P1 is shown in Scheme 1. The synthetic approach to prepare those compounds relies upon the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of azomethine ylides to C60.31 This method has been proven to be very efficient for the functionalization of C60 due to its versatility and the ready availability of the starting materials.31 The 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of the azomethine ylides generated in situ from P1 and sarcosine in refluxing chlorobenzene with C60 leads to the fulleropyrrolidine C606060–P1 in 25.3% yield. Owing to the presence of the branched tert-butyl phenyl substitute on the bay of the perylene moiety, compound C606060–P1 is highly soluble in common solvents such as toluene, CH2Cl2, CHCl3, THF, or NMP, and its complete spectroscopic characterization was easily achieved. The IR spectrum of C606060–P1 shows a characteristic absorption band of C60 at around 525 cm−1, and the 1H-NMR spectrum of C606060–P1 in CDCl3 solution also shows all the expected signals, such as those corresponding to the pyrrolidine ring at δ
				= 4.95, 4.84, and 4.21 ppm. Interestingly, the signals (δ
				= 7.65 ppm) corresponding to some of the protons of the phenyl group directly attached to the pyrrolidine ring are broad (for details, see ESI†), which indicates restricted rotation of the phenyl substitute on the pyrrolidine ring.32 This result is in good accordance with the data previously reported by Eckert et al.9 The structure of C606060–P1 is also characterized by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy with a molecular isotopic peak at m/z
				= 1976.71 ([M + 1]+, calculated for C142H85N3O9: 1975.71). The fragment showing the peak at 1256.71, corresponding to [M − C60]+
				(calculated for C82H85N3O9: 1255.71), is also consistent with the structure of C606060–P1. Thermal properties of compounds P1 and C606060–P1 are investigated by means of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere, which shows that C606060–P1 has better thermal stability than P1 with its decomposition temperature up to 432 °C as shown in Fig. 1.

The model fulleropyrrolidine FP was obtained in 21.9% yield by treatment of C60 with 4-(5-bromopentyloxy)benzaldehyde and sarcosine in refluxing chlorobenzene (Scheme 2). The 1H-NMR spectra of FP shows all the expected signals, and restricted rotation of the phenyl substitute on the pyrrolidine ring is also observed for compound FP.†
The electrochemistry of the compounds C606060–P1, and FP were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV). All the experiments were performed in dichloromethane solution using tetrabutylammonium perchlorate as the supporting electrolyte, glassy carbon as the working electrode, Pt as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. The scan rate was 100 mV s−1. The voltammetric results are presented in Fig. 2 and the data are collected in Table 1.

C606060–P1 shows three reversible reduction peaks characterized with one-electron in the cathodic region (Table 1 and Fig. 2). The first and second reduction potentials of C606060–P1 are very close to those of P1, which indicates that both reduction peaks of fullerene in C606060–P1 are hidden. The third reversible reduction wave is C60-based. The observed C60-based reduction potential (E1/2) of C606060–P1 is shifted to a more negative value compared with the model compound FP. This is typical for most C60 adducts which show small shifts due to the partial loss of conjugation upon derivation.33 In the anodic region, C606060–P1 presents one, reversible oxidation peak characterized with one-electron corresponding to the P1 model compound. The electrochemical data indicate that there is no distinct ground-state electronic interaction between the electron-donating perylene and the electron-accepting fullerene.
The ground-state electronic absorption spectra of the compounds C606060–P1, P1, and FP in CH2Cl2 are shown in Fig. 3. C606060–P1 matches the profile obtained by summation of the spectra of component units FP and P1
				(Fig. 3) within experimental error. This result is in agreement with previous studies on donor–acceptor dyads in solution34 and suggests that there is no significant ground-state interaction between the perylene moiety and the fullerene. Interestingly, the absorption spectrum of FP in CH2Cl2 displays two very intense bands in the UV and much weaker features in the visible spectral region (Table 2). In particular, two band maxima attributed to the lowest (λmax: 702 nm) and lowest allowed (λmax: 430 nm) singlet transitions are observed. The absorption spectrum of FP is very similar to that of the simple N-methylfulleropyrrolidine reported by Prato and Maggini,31 thus showing modest perturbations induced by the phenylene fragment bound to the pyrrolidine ring.

The absorption and fluorescence data of C606060–P1, P1, and FP are listed in Table 2. In the UV-Vis spectra, C606060–P1 and P1 show three typical perylene absorption peaks at 451, 537, and 578 nm with high coefficients. P1 in CH2Cl2 excited at 560 nm displays a fluorescence maximum at 610 nm. Also, dyad C606060–P1 has emission spectra with characteristic features of the perylene unit; however, its luminescence was largely quenched (Fig. 3). The fluorescence lifetimes (τ) of P1 and C606060–P1 were determined by a time-correlated single photon counting spectrometer with excitation at 370 nm. The fluorescence decay at λem
				= 610 nm is mono-exponential for P1
				(τ
				= 15.4 ns). C606060–P1 exhibits dual-exponential decay characteristics (τ1
				= 6.69 ns, 94% and τ2
				= 2.6 ns, 6%),† and the relative short-lived fluorescent component is attributed to the interaction between the perylene and the fullerene.36 It seems to be common sense that the solvent effect of the fluorescence quenching can be observed if intramolecular charge transfer occurs in a system.37 In this system, solvent polarity neither led to the shifts of the fluorescence emission band nor influenced the excited-state lifetime, although the emission intensity of C606060–P1 increased a little with increasing solvent polarity. This evidence disallows the possibility of the intramolecular charge transfer process in C606060–P1 at room temperature. FP exhibits a fluorescence band with λmax
				= 710 nm, and a emission quantum yield of 0.0022 and an excited-state lifetime of 1.2 ns. The excitation spectrum of C606060–P1 taken at λem
				= 710 nm matches the absorption profile throughout the UV-Vis spectral region of P1 [Fig. 3(a)]. These findings are consistent with quantitative occurrence of singlet–singlet energy transfer from the P1 unit to the fullerene in the dyad C606060–P1. The fluorescence of the perylene moiety in the dyad is strongly quenched by the intramolecular energy transfer (ca. 88.4%).
The photovoltaic device consists of a metal (Al) contact on the surface of an organic film of the C606060–P1 on a partially coated ITO glass. The organic layer was prepared by spin coating from chlorobenzene solution. The current–voltage characteristics of the ITO/C606060–P1/Al device under different white light intensities are depicted in Fig. 4. Under an intensity of 31 mW cm−2, the short-circuit current density and the open-circuit voltage of the device are about 3.76 μA cm−2 and 0.67 V, respectively. The IPCE (incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency) of the ITO/C606060–P1/Al device is equal to 0.01%. The performance of the ITO/C606060–P1/Al device is not as good as that observed for some fullerene–azothiophene-based solar cells.13 It is well known that the photocurrent is the result of photoinduced electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor. As shown in Fig. 5, the photocurrent spectrum of the ITO/C606060–P1/Al device matches the absorption spectrum of the dyad. This indicates that the characteristic electron transportation of the perylene moiety in the dyad dominates the performance of the device. We believe that the low efficiency of the device could result from the fact that hole transportation in the device is poor since the perylene moiety and the fullerene unit are both electron transporting domain species. Secondly, it is possible that the introduction of the pentyl group between the fullerene and the perylene may reduce charge transfer. On the other hand, the lower IPCE value is due to the fact that the device has not been optimized for layer thickness and device architectures.

Summary
In summary, a novel soluble and high thermally-stable fullerene dyad containing perylene as electronic donor has been synthesized. The electrochemical and photophysical studies in solution have revealed that there is no significant ground-state electronic interaction between the covalently bonded perylene and the fullerene sphere in C606060–P1. The photophysical study in dichloromethane solution has also shown that singlet–singlet energy transfer from the perylene unit to the fullerene in the dyad C606060–P1 takes place whereas electron transfer is a minor process. A photocurrent observed for ITO/C606060–P1/Al photovoltaic devices has shown that photoinduced electron transfer from the perylene moiety to C60 does occur, but the efficiencies of the photovoltaic devices are low, namely 0.01%. We believe that the main part of the light energy absorbed by the perylene fragment is promptly conveyed to the fullerene lowest singlet excited-state, and only a small part of absorbed light is able to contribute effectively to the photocurrent. The use of new donor-linked fullerenes that absorb in the visible range will be important for a broad absorption of the sunlight and as models for the study of charge mobility and transportation.
