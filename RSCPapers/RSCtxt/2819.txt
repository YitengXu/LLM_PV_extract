    , Accepted 31st May 2011First published on 11th July 2011AbstractAg+-coupled N-doped TiO2 (Ag+–N–TiO2) nanochains were newly synthesized by combination of sol–gel and hydrothermal methods, and their structures were characterized by TEM, SEM, and XPS. The UV-visible diffuse reflectance absorption spectrum of Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains was observed to absorb visible light in the broad range of 400–800 nm as compared to neat N–TiO2, exhibiting efficient visible light-photocatalytic activity. Their visible light absorption band became much broader and stronger upon formation of composites with heteropoly phosphotungstic acid (HPA), and their photocatalytic efficiency was observed to be further enhanced. The Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains also exhibited improved photovoltaic performance with significantly high photoenergy conversion efficiency (PCE) (5.6%) under AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2) as compared to N–TiO2 nanochains. The PCE was observed to be further enhanced to 7.6% by formation of HPA-composites. These results suggest that Ag and HPA play important roles in enhancement of PCE through the cooperative Z-scheme process of the electron transport triggered by two-color visible lights as in the plant photosynthetic system. The HPA-composites were also found to be useful for the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) as proved by synergistic enhancement of PCE to 10.2% as they are additionally incorporated with Ru-dye.
Introduction
TiO2 nanoparticles are non-toxic, highly photostable and cheap, and they have been widely used as photocatalysts for environmental purification and production of hydrogen from water.1–7 They are also important materials for solar cells8,9 alternative to the traditional silicon solar cells.8,10,11 However, due to their wide band gap corresponding to UV energy, their photocatalysis and solar cell actions are not activated by visible light dominant in the solar radiation,12 and their practical uses of solar energy remain limited to achieve higher solar energy conversion efficiencies. Thus, a great deal of attention has been paid to improve the visible light harvesting by incorporating TiO2 nanoparticles with photofunctional dyes.8–12 In 1991, O'Regan and Grätzel8 reported that efficient dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) could be developed based on the dye-incorporated TiO2 nanoparticles. Since then, many groups have attempted to improve the efficiency of DSSCs by enhancing visible light harvesting and electron transfer dynamics using various dye sensitizers and low-dimensional TiO2 nanostructures.13–19
Nevertheless, it is still far off to make a breakthrough for the DSSC to have photoenergy conversion efficiency (PCE) higher than 11%.20 The conventional DSSCs are based on one-color photoreaction of dye, mimicking a natural one-photosynthetic system. Such a one-color photoreaction is lacking cooperative energy distribution to protect the dye from bleaching. Also they need to be improved in the transport dynamics of the electrons through the semiconductor electrode by minimizing recombination of electrons with the oxidized dye or the electrolyte. In order to solve these problems, it would be necessary to develop solar cells based on two-color photoelectric conversion processes like the Z-scheme mechanism in the plant photosynthetic systems. Thus, TiO2 nanomaterials as well as the dye may need to be activated by visible light. Hereby, we had previously fabricated TiO2 nanocomposites by hybridizing TiO2 nanoparticles or nanodiscs with heteropoly phosphotungstic acid (H3PW12O40) (HPA). The HPA–TiO2 nanocomposites had been observed to resemble the plant photosynthetic reaction center21 for visible light-sensitive photocatalytic systems and solar cells.22 However, their photoenergy conversion efficiencies are not satisfactory. It may be due to low visible light absorption of TiO2 nanodiscs, and it is necessary to develop highly visible light-sensitive TiO2 nanomaterials.
Recently many groups have attempted to develop the visible light-absorbing TiO2 nanomaterials by doping some metals (as in MTiO2 (M = Fe, V, Mn)23–25) and N, C, and S into the lattice of the TiO2 (as in TiO2−xNx,26 TiO2−xCx,27 and Sm2Ti2O5S228) so that the O 2p states of TiO2 are modified by narrowing the band gap through chemical vapor deposition (CVD)29–31 and physical vapor deposition.27–33 However, still they have small absorption in the narrow visible region, leading to low photocatalytic efficiency by visible light. Further, the behaviors of fast exciton recombination and poor electron transport remain. Thus, it is highly required to develop further modified TiO2 nanomaterials exhibiting good electron transport dynamics as well as stronger absorption of visible light in a wide range.
Herein, as the novel visible light-sensitive TiO2 nanomaterials, Ag+-coupled N-doped TiO2 (Ag+–N–TiO2) nanochains were synthesized by combination of sol–gel and hydrothermal methods. Thereafter, their visible light photo-catalytic activities and photoelectro-chemical properties were examined with or without further modification of their surfaces with HPA and ruthenium dye (Ru-dye). Hence, the HPA-composites of Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains were found to be highly visible light-sensitive photocatalysts for efficient two-color solar cells operated by cooperative photoinduced electron transfer as the Z-scheme process in the plant photosynthetic system.
Experimental methods
Materials
The chemicals for the synthesis of nitrogen-doped TiO2 nanochains coupled with silver (Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains), ammonium titanyl oxalate monohydrate (99.998%, Aldrich), ammonium hydroxide A.C.S. reagent (Aldrich), and silver nitrate (>99.8%, Aldrich) were used as purchased. P-25 was purchased from Degussa-Huls. Acetonitrile (J. T. Baker), ethanol (Aldrich), Triton X-100 (WAKO PURE Chemical Industries. Ltd), lithium perchlorate (99+%, ACROS Organics), phosphotungstic acid (99.995%, Aldrich), Ru-dye (cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)-ruthenium(II) bis-tetrabutyl-ammonium (Ruthenium 535 bis-TBA, N-719, Solaronix SA, Switzerland)) were also used as purchased. The FTO glass (F-doped SnO2) sheet was obtained from Pilkington (sheet resistance: about 9 Ω sq−1). Heteropoly phosphotungstic acid (H3PW12O40) (HPA) was used as purchased from Fluka, Japan.
Formation and characterization of Ag+–N–TiO2 nano-chains and their HPA-composites
Detailed synthetic procedures of Ag+–N–TiO2 nano-chains were described in the ESI†. Firstly, N–TiO2 nanochains were synthesized by hydrothermal reaction at 200 °C for 6 h in an autoclave, using 10 mM (NH4)2TiO(C2O4)2 solution as a precursor. After cooling to room temperature, the product was filtered and dried in a vacuum oven at 200 °C for 5 h. The prepared N–TiO2 nanochains (0.10 mM) were mixed with 10 mL of 0.15 M AgNO3 solution by stirring at room temperature for 2 days in the dark. The mixture was evaporated by heating at 100 °C for 12 h until the remainder was about 20 mL and dried in an oven for 1 day. The dried solids were ground in an agate mortar and calcined at 400 °C for 6 h. As a result, the Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains were obtained.
The HPA composite of Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains was formed simply by mixing Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains (0.05 M) with HPA (0.5 mM) in aqueous solution. The HPA-incorporation with Ag+–N–TiO2 was confirmed as proved by measuring the FT-IR spectrum of as-prepared HPA/Ag+–N–TiO2.
In order to characterize the crystalline phase of the synthesized materials, XRD patterns were recorded on a Rigaku Rotaflex diffractometer (Model No. D/MAX-2200 Ultima/PC, rotating Cu target, 3 kW X-ray and set to 40 kV and 40 mA) at an X-ray incident angle of 0.02°. The morphology of the prepared electrodes was examined by SEM (JEOL JSM-7000F, Japan).
Surface analysis of the synthesized Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains was performed by using XPS spectroscopy.
Diffuse reflectance UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded by using a Shimadzu UV-3101PC spectrophotometer equipped with an integral sphere.
Measurement of photocatalytic activities
Photocatalysis experiment was performed according to the previously reported procedures.27 Photocatalytic activities of the Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains as well as Degussa P25 were measured by monitoring photooxidation of methylene blue (MB) or methyl orange (MO) in aqueous solution containing the photocatalysts. The photocatalytic quantum yields were measured by chemical actinometry using a ferrioxalate actinometer (see ESI†).
Preparation of different TiO2 electrode films
Working electrodes for photoelectro-chemical measurements were prepared as previously reported.34 20 mg of Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains or N–TiO2 nanochains were mixed with 50 μL of ethanol, followed by addition of 20 μL of polyoxyethylene octaphenyl ether (Triton X-100) to make a paste. The paste was coated on a fluorine-doped SnO2 conducting glass (FTO) by the doctor-blade technique.34 The heteropoly tungstic acid (HPA)-adsorbed TiO2 films were prepared by adding 20 μL of 0.2 M HPA solution to the TiO2 films, followed by sintering at 450 °C for 30 min. For the preparation of dye-adsorbed electrodes, the prepared HPA-adsorbed Ag+–N–TiO2 electrode was dipped into a solution of 5 × 10−4 M ruthenium dye and kept for 24 h in dye solution. The surface characterization of the prepared electrodes was carried out by measurement of SEM (JEOL JSM-7000F, Japan) images and XRD patterns (see ESI†). The thicknesses of the films were varied between 5 and 10 μm.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
The measurement of photoelectrochemical properties was carried out by recording photocurrent density (J) across a linear voltage sweep from +0.8 V to −0.1 V with a potentiostat (WonATech, WPG-100) attached with a programmed function generator (WonATech, Linear Sweep Voltammetry) upon irradiation with 300 W xenon light source (ASAHI SPECTRA, Japan) connected to a monochromator. The power of incident irradiance at the surface of electrode film was 100 mW cm−2. The spectral output of lamp was filtered using a KG-1 Heat Absorbing Glass filter (Newport, USA) that enables light from 350 to 800 nm to pass through and hence to reduce the light mismatch between the real solar illumination and the solar simulated illumination (AM 1.5) to less than 2%. The TiO2 films were mounted as a working electrode in a three-electrode system. The counter electrode was a platinum net enclosed in a glass tube with a glass frit and the reference electrodes used were Ag/AgCl with saturated 1 M NaCl in water. The working electrode was immersed in acetonitrile containing 0.3 M lithium perchlorite (LiClO4) solution as the electrolyte. The electrolyte solution (1 L) in the closed vessel was purged with nitrogen at atmospheric pressure. The cell can be represented as follows: FTO/Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains–HPA/dye/electrolyte/Pt. The Teflon vessel was covered with a black box to avoid reflections from the incoming light. To maintain a constant concentration of the components in the electrolyte at the electrode–electrolyte interface, the solution was stirred during all the measurements.
Results and discussion
Structural and optoelectronic characterization of Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains and their HPA composites

Fig. 1(A) shows the TEM image identifying the structure of the as-synthesized Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains, which is the same as that of N–TiO2 nanochains. The chains were observed to be formed through lattice connection of spherical particles as confirmed by the high resolution TEM image in Fig. 1(B), exhibiting a well-defined lattice spacing of about 0.34 nm corresponding to the (101) cell spacing of the anatase crystal. The average particle size of the spherical particles observed from the TEM image was about 8–9 nm in diameter, which appeared in general agreement with that determined from the XRD reflection line width (see below). The XRD pattern of Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains (Fig. 1(C-a)) exhibits combination of peaks originated from N–TiO2 nanochains (Fig. 1(C-b)) and AgNO3 (Fig. 1(C-c)). The XRD pattern of N–TiO2 nanochains (Fig. 1(C-b)) shows (010), (004), (200), (105), and (204) plane peaks corresponding to the anatase crystal phase,35 as supported by the TEM images. These results confirm that silver ions are loaded on the surface of anatase N–TiO2 nanoparticles. The size of N–TiO2 nanoparticles in the nanochains was determined to be about 8.43 nm by Debye–Scherrer analysis of the line width of the (101) reflection.

Fig. 2(A) shows Ti 2p XPS spectra of Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains and N–TiO2 nanochains. It is noteworthy that the Ti 2p binding energy of Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains was observed to be relatively increased as compared to that of the N–TiO2 nano-chain, indicating that Ag+ is bound with N–TiO2 and the outer electron of Ti 2p is transferred to the surface-bound Ag+.36 More detailed XPS data support the binding characteristics of Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains (Fig. S1†). These results suggest that most of the silver ions are converted into Ag metal upon binding with N–TiO2 nanochains. This is because TiO2 is an n-type semiconductor having electrons as the majority of carrier.37,38 This suggestion is supported by TEM images exhibiting about 2 nm sized silver particles (dark spots) on the surface of the N–TiO2 nanoparticles as shown in Fig. 1(A). Unless the TiO2 is illuminated, silver metal formed is not oxidized back by the holes.

The irradiation light used was obtained using a 400 nm cut-off filter. 
The formation of HPA-composites of Ag+–N–TiO2 (HPA–Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains) was confirmed as proved by measuring the FT-IR spectrum. As shown in Fig. S2†, the vibrational frequency bands of W–O (750–900 cm−1 region) were observed to be red-shifted as compared to those of free HPA, indicating that W–O is bound with TiO2 as reported previously.21 Measurement of SEM images and XRD patterns of the composites demonstrated that white crystalline particles of HPA heterojunctioned with the nanochains as islands (vide infra).

Fig. 2(B) shows the diffuse reflectance UV-visible absorption spectra of different TiO2 nanochains along with that of P-25. N–TiO2 nanochains exhibit broad visible light absorption in the range from 450 nm to 800 nm as compared to that of TiO2 nanodiscs or P-25 due to the N-doping effect as already reported.26 The visible light absorption band of Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains was observed to be broader and red-shifted as compared to that of N–TiO2 nanochains. This may be due to the surface charge-transfer states formed by electron transfer from N–TiO2 conduction band to silver or silver ion as proved by the change in binding energy of Ti 2p XPS as discussed above. Further it is noteworthy that the visible light absorption of HPA–Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains (curve a) was enhanced as compared to that of Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains (curve b). This implies that HPA plays an important role in further charge separation through the efficient formation of the charge transfer states at the heterojunction between HPA and TiO2 as previously reported.15
Visible light photocatalytic activities of Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains and their HPA-composites
The formation of surface charge-transfer states is expected to retard the exciton recombination so that the nanochains and their HPA-composites would be very useful as highly improved photoelectric functional materials such as visible light-photocatalysts and solar cells by efficient electron transport as well as visible light harvesting. To explore this speculation, we attempted to observe the visible light photocatalytic activities of the nanochains by monitoring the photooxidation of dyes such as MB or MO (5.0 × 10−5 M) in aqueous solution under oxygen bubbling.34Fig. 2(C) shows the plot of relative absorption change of MB at 465 nm as a function of irradiation time, exhibiting fast photocatalytic decomposition of MB by the nanochains. The photocatalytic oxidation of MO was also observed (Fig. S3†). These results indicate that the photocatalytic efficiency of Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains for photooxidation of MB is significantly higher than that of analogous N–TiO2 nanoparticles or P-25. The visible light-induced photocatalytic quantum efficiency of the Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains for the photooxidation of MO illuminated by 436 nm light was determined to be extremely higher (46%) than P-25 (3%) and N–TiO2 nanochains (9%) as determined by the ferrioxalate actinometric method (see ESI†), S3 and S4† show that Ag plays an important role in the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains by prolonging charge separation. It is known that the loaded Ag acts as the Schottky barrier.37 Thus, Ag may trap the photogenerated hole, resulting in prolonged charge separation so that reactivity of electrons is enhanced. The reactive electrons produce oxidizing agents such as O˙− and OH˙− by reacting with oxygen and water,5,6,12 which consequently oxidize MB.
The visible-light photocatalytic activity of HPA–Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains was even much higher than that of Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains as seen from Fig. 2(C-a), indicating that HPA plays another role in enhancement of the photocatalytic efficiency. It is known that HPA is an excellent electron pool to trap many electrons, and it is easily reduced to a heteropoly blue (HPB) by accepting electron from the conduction band of Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains as illustrated in Fig. 3. The HPB consequently absorbs another visible light to form the excited state HPB which relays electron back to the conduction band as previously reported.21 This cyclic electron transfer may keep the prolonged electron–hole separation so that the interfacial electron or hole transport is more feasible by cooperating with Ag. Hereby, it can be suggested that Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains and HPA act like photosystems I and II (PS I and PS II) of the plant photosynthetic systems, respectively, and the repetitive Z-scheme electron transfer takes place between the light-activated Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains and HPA through the electron relay. This cooperative electron transfer may cause the synergistic enhancement of the visible-light photocatalytic activity.

Photoelectrochemical properties of Ag+–N–TiO2 nano-chain films
The nanochain films were fabricated on FTO glass with or without incorporation of a good electron pool, H3PW12O40 (HPA). The SEM images (Fig. S6a†) of the electrode film of Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains showed the porous surface which is heterojunctioned with white crystalline HPA islands (Fig. S6b†). The SEM image of cross-section of the HPA–Ag+–N–TiO2 film exhibited the thickness of ca. 9.0 μm. Analysis of X-ray diffractions of HPA–N–TiO2 nanoparticles and HPA–Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains (Fig. S7†) confirmed that Ag is not incorporated with HPA but with N–TiO2 as discussed above.
The photoelectrochemical properties of different Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochain films were examined by measuring photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves upon illumination with the solar simulator (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2). The typical J–V curves are shown in Fig. 4. The photoenergy conversion efficiencies (PCE (η (%))) of the TiO2 films were evaluated by using the photovoltaic data and following eqn (1):22 η = (FF × JSC × VOC)/Pin × 100(1)where FF is the fill factor obtained from the observed maximum voltage, JSC is the short circuit current density, VOC is the open circuit voltage, and Pin is the incident light power density. The photovoltaic performance parameters for different Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains are presented in Table 1. The PCE of free Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains was 5.6% which is significantly higher than that of N–TiO2 nanochains (3.9%) or TiO2 nanodiscs (2.4%).22 These results indicate that Ag-loading into N–TiO2 causes the enhancement of PCE. This is probably due to the hole trapping by Ag as discussed above for the photocatalytic activity of Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains. The hole trapping by Ag causes the prolonged charge separation so that the interfacial electron transport is more feasible to enhance the electric conductivity.

Film thicknesses are ∼9.0 μm.

The Ag-effect on the PCE enhancement may be also due to an increase in visible light absorptivity of Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains as compared with N–TiO2 nanochains as seen from Fig. 2B. In order to confirm this, the photoelectrochemical activities of the electrodes measured at different wavelengths were also evaluated in terms of the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) using the following eqn (2) IPCE (%) = [Jp(λ)/e]/[I(λ)/hν] × 100(2)where Jp(λ) is the photocurrent density, hν is the incident photon energy (h: Planck's constant, ν: light frequency), I(λ) is the monochromatic light intensity and e is the electronic charge. Fig. 5(A) shows the IPCE action spectra of different TiO2 films. The IPCE spectrum of the P-25 TiO2 film (curve e) exhibits negligible IPCE in the visible wavelength region, matching well with the UV-vis absorption spectrum. The IPCE spectrum of the N–TiO2 nanochain film also relatively matches with the UV-vis absorption spectrum, displaying significant IPCE enhancement observed in the visible wavelength region (curve d). Even higher IPCE up to 40% was observed from the Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochain film (curve c), exhibiting the broader spectral band extended to the longer wavelength down to 800 nm as compared with that of the N–TiO2 nanochain film.
 Fig. 5  (A) IPCE spectra of films composed of ruthenium dye-adsorbed HPA–Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains (a), HPA–Ag+–N–TiO2 nano-chains (b), Ag+–N–TiO2 (c), N–TiO2 (d), and P-25 TiO2 (e). (B) Normalized IPCE spectra obtained by normalizing the IPCE maximum of each film to 100%. 
This superior optical property of the Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochain was also clearly demonstrated when the IPCE maximum is normalized to 100% (Fig. 5(B)). The impact of Ag on the enhancement of the PCE can be visualized by exhibiting significant spectral shift to low photon energy from the N–TiO2 spectrum. This indicates that Ag plays a role in the improved harvesting characteristics of visible light of Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains, being consistent with highly visible-light absorption probably because of the charge transfer from N–TiO2 to Ag as discussed for the enhancement of the reflectance absorption spectrum from 400 nm to 800 nm (Fig. 2(B)).
Then, it is further noteworthy that much higher PCE (7.6%) and IPCE (60%) were evaluated with HPA–Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains as compared to that of the free Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains. These results imply that HPA plays an important role in further charge separation through the efficient formation of the charge transfer states at the heterojunction between HPA and TiO2 as already discussed above. Incidentally, the IPCE band of HPA–Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains was observed to be further shifted toward longer wavelength beyond 600 nm as compared to that of free Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains (Fig. 4), indicating that additional color photoreaction is involved in the activation of electron transfer in the presence of HPA. Such two-color photoinduced charge separation has been already reported to take place effectively in the HPA-incorporated TiO2 nanoparticles and nanodiscs as the Z-scheme mechanism in the plant photosynthetic system.21,22
Again Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains and HPA act like photosystems I and II (PS I and PS II) of the plant photosynthetic systems respectively, and the repetitive Z-scheme electron transfer takes place between the light-activated Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains and HPA through electron relay as shown in Fig. 3. It is again noteworthy that the PCE obtained with HPA–Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains was observed to be much higher than that obtained with HPA–N–TiO2 nanochains, indicating that Ag plays an important role in the Z-scheme electron transfer mechanism. That is, Ag seems to retard exciton recombination by accepting hole from the valence band of N–TiO2 so that the electron in the conduction band can be more efficiently transferred to HPA to produce HPB. The HPB is known to be re-oxidized by absorbing the 760 nm light21 so that a significant portion of the photo-generated electrons is transported back to the conduction band of TiO2. Thus, such an Ag relayed repetitive electron transfer so that HPA–Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains function as an artificial photosynthetic system more efficiently than other HPA–TiO2 systems,21,22 so that the charge carriers can be effectively shuttled from the electrolyte to the counter electrode.
Such Z-scheme electron transfer reactions have been also reported to be complementarily sensitized by ruthenium dyes adsorbed on the HPA–TiO2 film surface,22 and the HPA–Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains would be useful substrates for the dye sensitized solar cell. In order to check this possibility, the photoelectrochemical solar cell properties of HPA–Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains adsorbed with the ruthenium (Ru)-dye were also examined. The representative J–V curve obtained with the dye-adsorbed HPA-incorporated Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochain film is shown in Fig. 4 from which the PCE was determined to be greatly enhanced to 10.2% as compared to that of the HPA–Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochain film. However, the PCE value obtained from the Ru-dye-adsorbed Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochain film without HPA is only 6.5% which is even smaller than that obtained from HPA–Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains without dye adsorption (7.6%) as can be seen in Table 1. The IPCE band of the HPA-incorporated Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochain film was also observed to be further shifted toward longer wavelength and broader with enhanced IPCE (75%) beyond 500 nm by incorporating with the Ru-dye (Fig. 5(A)). These results indicate that the dye sensitization is also very efficient in the photoelectrochemical activities of the HPA–Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochain film, suggesting that HPA–Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains are very good materials for the efficient DSSC.
Conclusions
Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains were newly synthesized by combination of the sol–gel method and hydrothermal reaction. Their HPA-composites were found to be very useful not only as the highly visible-light sensitive photocatalyst but also as the efficient solar cell materials by feasible interfacial electron transport processes mimicking the Z-scheme mechanism found in the plant photosynthetic system. Adsorption of the Ru-dye on the HPA-incorporated Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochain film was found to result in further enhancement of the PCE up to over 10% under AM 1.5 irradiation. Therefore, many other dye sensitizers would be applicable to the HPA–Ag+–N–TiO2 nanochains to bring the DSSC to a higher PCE level. These applications are under investigation in our laboratory.
