    , Accepted 4th September 2019First published on 4th September 2019AbstractUltrathin 2D nickel(II) (Ni2+) and imidazole (Im) based zeolitic imidazolate framework Ni(Im)2 nanosheets are reported as exceptional efficient electrocatalysts for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction. Five nanometre thick nanosheets have a higher faradaic efficiency of 78.8% and a surface active site density of 1.68 × 10−7 mol cm−2, which is superior to those of thicker nanosheets and bulk Ni(Im)2.
The electrochemical conversion of CO2 to chemicals has been highlighted as a possible pathway to reduce carbon footprint and produce renewable fuels.1 Despite numerous investigations over the past several decades, the lack of high-performance electrocatalysts remains the main obstacle for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR).2,3 More recently, transition metals and their compounds have been used as CO2RR electrocatalysts to reduce the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction and enhance the selectivity.4 However, the active sites are usually blocked during the catalytic reaction.5 Thus, it is still a great challenge and of significance to further investigate catalysts with controlled morphologies for CO2RR with high selectivity.6
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are based on self-assembly by coordination bonds between organic ligands and metal nodes,7 and have applications in the fields of biomedicine, energy and environment due to their unique and tailorable porosities.7c,8 Due to their inherent advantages, bulk MOFs have exhibited promising electrocatalytic activity in CO2RR and water oxidation as heterogeneous catalysts.7d,9 However, catalytic active sites in bulk MOFs are largely hindered by the poor electrical conductivity, blockage of active metal centres and inevitable gas diffusion barrier, which significantly limit their applications as electrocatalysts.10 Ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) MOF nanosheets could be high-performance electrocatalysts because 2D MOF nanosheets with nanometre thicknesses allow rapid mass transport and superior electron transfer, and exhibit extremely high percentages of exposed catalytic active surfaces to ensure high catalytic activity.11 In addition, a comparison between 2D MOF nanosheets with different thicknesses and their bulk MOF precusors offers ideal model materials for the CO2RR with high selectivity and catalytic activity at the same catalytic active centers.
Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are a subgroup of stable MOFs which constructed from imidazolate and metals. Here, we exfoliated layered bulk Ni(Im)2 ZIF to 2D Ni(Im)2 nanosheets with different thicknesses (5 nm, 15 nm, 65 nm and 140 nm) and employed them as CO2RR catalysts for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO. The faradaic efficiency (FE) of CO increased from 33.7% of bulk Ni(Im)2 to 78.8% of 2D Ni(Im)2-5 nm, which demonstrated that thinner MOF nanosheets faciliated higher catalytic selectivity. Meanwhile, the surface active site density on the catalysts increased from 8.17 × 10−8 mol cm−2 of bulk Ni(Im)2 to 1.68 × 10−7 mol cm−2 of 2D Ni(Im)2-5 nm. This further confirmed that the ultrathin nanosheets had high active site numbers. Furthermore, the selectivity and activity of 2D Ni(Im)2-5 nm could be controlled by the amounts of ammonium hydroxide in the synthetic processes and the concentrations of HCO3− in the electrolyte in the processes of CO2RR. The advantageous nanosheet structures with enlarged surface area and abundant planar-coordinated catalytic Ni sites in 2D Ni(Im)2-5 nm resulted in large current density and high CO selectivity, which were highly desirable for practical applications.
The synthesis performed with the reactants nickel acetate, imidazole and ammonium hydroxide in the presence of water at 100 °C for 5 h yielded bulk Ni(Im)2, which had a porous 2D layered structure.12 The nickel(II) ion and the imidazole ligand formed a two-dimensional network with planar square grids that stacked parallelly in the c direction (Fig. S1, ESI†). The coordination geometry of Ni to four nitrogen atoms was very close to the planar square.12 The distance between the adjacent layers was 5.73 Å, which indicated the possible fabrication of 2D Ni(Im)2 nanosheets through the top-down exfoliation method.12 The 2D Ni(Im)2 nanosheets were synthesized by liquid exfoliation of a pristine Ni(Im)2 ZIF under ultrasonication (Fig. 1a). Afterwards, we used different centrifugal forces to separate the nanosheets with different thicknesses, which were further characterized by AFM. The powder XRD pattern of the bulk Ni(Im)2 as well as the nanosheets was consistent with the simulated one (Fig. S2, ESI†).12 Meanwhile, two strong peaks at binding energies of 855.8 and 873.1 eV corresponded to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2, respectively, which were typical values for Ni2+ in bulk Ni(Im)2 and 2D Ni(Im)2-5 nm (Fig. S3, ESI†).13 Four Ni(Im)2 nanosheets were obtained successfully with thicknesses of ∼140 nm indicating 244 layers (2D Ni(Im)2-140 nm), ∼65 nm indicating 113 layers (2D Ni(Im)2-65 nm), ∼15 nm indicating 26 layers (2D Ni(Im)2-15 nm) and ∼5 nm indicating 9 layers (2D Ni(Im)2-5 nm) (Fig. S4 and S5, ESI†). Their BET surface areas were 40.2 m2 g−1, 55.7 m2 g−1, 114.9 m2 g−1 and 165.3 m2 g−1, respectively (Fig. S6, ESI†). Compared to the bulk ZIF, 2D Ni(Im)2 nanosheets exhibited better homogeneous dispersion in water with a strong Tyndall effect (Fig. S7, ESI†), demonstrating their nanomaterial feature. TEM characterization also indicated the successful exfoliation of bulk Ni(Im)2 into thin nanosheets with different thicknesses (Fig. 1b–f). The obtained thin nanosheet was well suited for electrocatalysis with reduced diffusion kinetics and enhanced electron transfer properties compared to bulk materials.11

The electrocatalytic CO2RR activity of the catalysts was evaluated in 0.5 M KHCO3 aqueous solution within a gas-tight two-compartment (H-type) electrolytic cell (Fig. S8, ESI†). The following reaction was proposed: CO2 + 2H+ + 2e− → CO + H2O(1)
Catalysts were blended with XC72 conductive carbon black and Nafion polymer binder and dropped onto carbon fiber paper (CFP) as the working electrode. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of the catalysts showed different cathodic waves in N2-saturated (pH 8.4) or CO2-saturated (pH 7.2) 0.5 M KHCO3 electrolytes from 0 V to −1.2 V (vs. RHE) (Fig. S9, ESI†). All catalysts demonstrated higher current densities in CO2 than in N2, indicating apparent CO2RR. The polarization curve of 2D Ni(Im)2-5 nm in CO2-saturated 0.5 M KHCO3 exhibited a cathodic current onset at approximately −0.55 V (vs. RHE) due to CO2RR, and beyond that, the current density continuously increased and reached 9 mA cm−2 at −1.2 V (vs. RHE) (Fig. S9, ESI†). Meanwhile, 2D Ni(Im)2-140 nm, 2D Ni(Im)2-65 nm, 2D Ni(Im)2-15 nm and bulk Ni(Im)2 also exhibited CO2RR activities, which were though poorer than that of 2D Ni(Im)2-5 nm. LSV in N2 experiments suggested that in the absence of any CO2 feed gas, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) became the dominant cathodic process, and its current density was much diminished according to the poor HER activity of bulk Ni(Im)2.14
In order to identify and quantify the CO2RR products, electrolysis was performed at different potentials between −0.5 V and −1.1 V (vs. RHE). Gaseous products were periodically sampled and determined online using gas chromatography (GC). We found that CO was the dominant reduction product for 2D Ni(Im)2-5 nm, accompanied by the cogeneration of a small amount of H2. To confirm the carbon source from the CO2RR reduction process, a control experiment in a N2 atmosphere was performed. H2 was the only product in this control experiment, which demonstrated that CO was produced by the reduction of CO2 (Fig. S10, ESI†). The faradaic efficiencies of different products at various potentials were calculated and summarized (Fig. S11, ESI†). As shown in Fig. S11e (ESI†), CO was first reliably and reproducibly detected as positive at −0.55 V (vs. RHE) on 2D Ni(Im)2-5 nm. Initially, the FE was ∼16%, then it prominently rose to 78.8% at −0.85 V (vs. RHE). At the same time, the FEs of CO on 2D Ni(Im)2-15 nm, 2D Ni(Im)2-65 nm, 2D Ni(Im)2-140 nm and bulk Ni(Im)2 were only 53.7%, 40.5%, 35.3% and 33.7% at −0.85 V (vs. RHE), respectively (Fig. S11a–d, ESI†). The FE results of five catalysts were compared and are shown in Fig. 2, demonstrating the correlation between FE selectivity and 2D MOF nanosheet thickness. Furthermore, the carbon monoxide partial current densities of 2D Ni(Im)2-5 nm, 2D Ni(Im)2-15 nm, 2D Ni(Im)2-65 nm and 2D Ni(Im)2-140 nm were calculated and plotted against the working potential as shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†). 2D Ni(Im)2-5 nm delivered a maximum value of jCO = 7.0 mA cm−2 at −0.95 V (vs. RHE), whereas that of 2D Ni(Im)2-15 nm did not exceed 4.5 mA cm−2. The partial current densities of CO with thicker 2D Ni(Im)2-65 nm and 2D Ni(Im)2-140 nm did not exceed 2.0 mA cm−2. This comparison demonstrated that the thinner ZIF nanosheets enhanced electron transfer and facilitated the reaction kinetics.11e

Ultrathin nanosheets of 2D Ni(Im)2-5 nm not only presented enhanced reaction kinetics but also provided more reaction active sites for CO2RR electrocatalysis due to their enlarged surface area. We estimated the surface active Ni sites of bulk Ni(Im)2, 2D Ni(Im)2-140 nm, 2D Ni(Im)2-65 nm, 2D Ni(Im)2-15 nm and 2D Ni(Im)2-5 nm by integrating the anodic peak areas from the CV curves, respectively. The surface active site density was 1.68 × 10−7 mol cm−2, which accounted for 3.3% of total Ni sites (Fig. S13, ESI†). This is higher than those of 2D Ni(Im)2-15 nm (1.18 × 10−7 mol cm−2, 2.3% of total Ni sites), 2D Ni(Im)2-65 nm (1.04 × 10−7 mol cm−2, 2.0% of total Ni sites), 2D Ni(Im)2-140 nm (8.51 × 10−8 mol cm−2, 1.7% of total Ni sites) and bulk Ni(Im)2 (8.17 × 10−8 mol cm−2, 1.6% of total Ni sites), which matched well with the trends of thickness and BET surface area. The better catalytic activity of 2D Ni(Im)2-5 nm was also supported by the higher turnover frequency, which was up to 770 h−1 at −0.95 V (vs. RHE) and was better than that of 2D Ni(Im)2-15 nm with 594 h−1 at the same potential (Fig. 3a). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) plot in the high frequency revealed that 2D Ni(Im)2-5 nm and 2D Ni(Im)2-15 nm exhibited lower interfacial charge-transfer resistance (RCT) than bulk Ni(Im)2, which proved that nanosheets could enhance the electron transfer. In addition, the slope of the EIS plot in the low frequency revealed that 2D Ni(Im)2-5 nm and 2D Ni(Im)2-15 nm had different mass transfer processes. The slope of 2D Ni(Im)2-5 nm was close to 1 indicating a good diffusion mass transfer process, and the slope of 2D Ni(Im)2-15 nm was close to 90° indicating good capacitive behavior (Fig. S14, ESI†).15 This ensured faster electron transfer from electrodes to CO2 and easier formation of CO2˙− radical anion intermediate with diffusion mass transfer. The 2D Ni(Im)2-5 nm showed a clearly improved CO2 reduction performance possibly attributed to the increased surface active sites and improved electronic conductivity.16 This further confirmed that the ultrathin nanosheet had high catalytic selectivity and catalytic activity.

The operation sustainability of 2D Ni(Im)2-5 nm was assessed by electrolysis at −0.85 V (vs. RHE) for 14 h. Our catalyst delivered a stable cathodic current density of ∼5 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3b). Analysis of the carbon monoxide in the catholyte during the 14 h electrolysis led to an average faradaic efficiency of ∼70%, suggesting that the CO2RR selectivity was well preserved during the long-term electrolysis. The 14 h durability proved that 2D Ni(Im)2-5 nm could be applied as a potential catalyst for future evaluation.
To illuminate on the possible CO2RR mechanistic pathway, we performed Tafel analysis and plotted the overpotential versus the logarithm of steady-state CO partial current density (Fig. 3c). The plot for 2D Ni(Im)2-5 nm was linear in the overpotential range from 0.45 to 0.65 V with a Tafel slope of 137 mV dec−1. This indicated that the possible rate-determining step was the initial electron transfer to CO2 to form a CO2− intermediate. The upward Tafel slope curvature at larger overpotentials was likely caused by the limitations of mass transport.4b,d
In addition, a plot of log(jCO) vs. log([HCO3−]) shows a slope of 0.76 in Fig. 3d, indicating that the HCO3− concentration could apparently influence the efficiency of CO2 electroreduction. The HCO3− may not only simply act as a proton donor in the reaction solution, but also increase the concentration of CO2via rapid equilibrium with bicarbonate.17 Furthermore, we could not only control the concentrations of HCO3− through the electrolyte in the processes of CO2RR but also the amounts of ammonium hydroxide in the synthetic processes. Because ammonium hydroxide was used in the synthesis of Ni(Im)2 as a modulator, which was also a nitrogen-containing compound and possibly coordinated with Ni, the influence of ammonium hydroxide on the catalyst and its performance was investigated. It can be seen that as the amount of ammonium hydroxide increased, the structure of Ni(Im)2 changed from the α phase to the β phase (Fig. S15, ESI†) with morphology changes (Fig. S16, ESI†).12 At the same time, the FE of CO from 78.8% decreased to ∼20% at with the increase of the amount of ammonium hydroxide (Fig. S17, ESI†). This suggested that excess ammonium hydroxide was used, which had a negative influence on the regulation of the MOF crystallization process and catalytic activity.
In conclusion, exfoliated ultrathin 2D Ni-MOF nanosheets with different thicknesses were chosen as effective CO2RR catalysts. The 2D Ni(Im)2-5 nm with a lesser thickness and more active sites demonstrated higher catalytic selectivity, faster reaction kinetics, and higher TOF. The modulation of HCO3− during catalysis and ammonium hydroxide in the synthesis procedure could enhance the selectivity and activity of 2D Ni(Im)2-5 nm. Future studies should focus on the discovery of catalytic metal sites at the atomic or molecular scale for the purpose of simultaneously achieving high activity and selectivity for CO2 electroreduction.
