These processes involve, for example, hydrogen production from water splitting, carbon dioxide reduction, pollutant degradation, and the conversion of raw organic chemical materials into high-value-added chemicals. Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have become a new class of promising cheap and easy to manufacture candidate materials for use in photocatalytic semiconductors due to their advantages of high extinction coefficients, optimal band gaps, high photoluminescence quantum yields, and long electron–hole diffusion lengths.

1. Introduction
Photocatalytic technology has recently promoted scientific exploration and development in different fields, such as the degradation of organic compounds in liquid and gas phases, water splitting, the reduction of carbon dioxide, and photocatalytic organic synthesis.1–4 An ideal photocatalytic material should exhibit physical characteristics that promote the photocatalytic process, that is, broad and strong spectral absorption, low exciton binding energy to achieve efficient electron–hole separation, excellent electron or hole migration to allow photogenerated carriers to migrate to the surface of the catalyst, suitable band edge positions to enable appropriate oxidation–reduction capabilities for the target reaction, and long-term operational stability to maintain the continuous occurrence of the catalytic reaction.5 In reality, most photocatalysts are not perfect. For example, the wide band gap (3.2 eV) of TiO2, the most widely studied and most mature photocatalyst, limits its applicability in the visible and infrared wavelength ranges.6 In addition, the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs in TiO2 leads to rapid energy dissipation, thereby reducing the efficiency of photocatalysis.7 Another photocatalyst example is hematite. Although it has wide visible light absorption and excellent stability, the light absorption, arising from its indirect band gap transition, requires a relatively deep penetration depth, which is contradicted by its extremely short minority carrier lifetime and diffusion length. This inconsistency hinders the effective collection of minority carriers and interfacial charge transfer reactions.8–10 In addition, the kinetics of the water oxidation reaction involving holes on the surface of hematite seem to be very slow, increasing charge recombination and reducing the photocurrent and photocatalytic efficiency.10 At present, most other photocatalysts that are relatively mature also show many unsatisfactory deficiencies, limiting the progress of photocatalytic reactions. Therefore, a strong desire to develop new semiconductor photocatalysts with excellent performance continues to stimulate a great deal of exploration and research in this field.
MHP semiconductors have been successfully used in various optoelectronic devices (such as solar cells, light-emitting diodes, low-threshold lasers, and photodetectors) due to their adjustable direct band gaps, long carrier diffusion lengths, high carrier mobilities, and extraordinary tolerance of defects.11–24 These characteristics also make MHPs very suitable for photocatalytic applications involving converting solar energy into chemical energy, especially (1) their high light absorption coefficients and easy-to-adjust band gaps; (2) their long carrier diffusion lengths, which can prolong the lifetimes of charge carriers; and (3) the existence of suitable charge transfer during redox reactions.25 MHPs usually have low enthalpies of formation, due to the “softness” of crystal chemical bonds; their theoretical decomposition energy barriers are also very low, only 0.1 eV.26 In essence, they are easy to form and easy to damage, and their ease of decomposition has the same origin as the low defect-formation energy.27,28 Under external stimuli (such as moisture, polar solvents, oxygen, heat, and radiation), halide perovskites are easily decomposed into their binary halide components (for example, MAPbI3 → MAI + PbI2).29 Therefore, under typical photocatalytic reaction conditions, the ionic lattices of MHPs are highly unstable. For example, water splitting, CO2 reduction, and dye degradation all require water or polar solvents, which will provide harmful degradation pathways that are not conducive to long-term use.29,30 In addition, for certain radical-based reactions, such as dye degradation, the use of water or a polar solvent is a prerequisite for the formation of the radical species that drive the reaction. In these cases, the relative reactivities and unstable characteristics of ionic MHP crystals have so far limited their application as photocatalysts.29,31 Nevertheless, the first report on MHP-based photocatalysis appeared in December 2016, when Nam and colleagues outlined a strategy for photocatalytically driven HI decomposition using MAPbI3, which takes advantage of the dynamic equilibrium relating to the dissolution and reprecipitation of MAPbI3 in saturated HI aqueous solution.32 So far, a lot of researchers have made substantial efforts to use MHPs in photocatalytic reactions. For example, a halide perovskite powder suspension was used in non-aqueous solution to reduce CO2.33 In addition, a functional layer can be used to protect an MHP photoelectrode to ensure that it continues to play a role in the reduction of H2O and CO2.34,35 In another case, a perovskite photovoltaic cell can drive electrocatalytic water splitting or CO2 reduction upon connecting a sealed photovoltaic cell to an electrocatalytic cell.36 Although MHP-based photocatalysis research has made some progress, the field is still in its infancy, and there is still a lot of room for innovation when it comes to designing optimum reaction systems and enhancing the stabilities and efficiencies of MHP photocatalysts.29
In this review, we introduce the structural advantages of the perovskites used in photocatalysis and achievements made relating to metal halide perovskite photocatalyst particle suspension systems, photoelectrode thin film systems, and photovoltaic (photo-) electrocatalytic systems. The latest progress relating to the use of MHPs in water splitting, CO2 reduction, organic conversion, and other aspects of photocatalysis and photoelectrochemical energy conversion is introduced. Next, rigorous analysis of potential problems, such as Pb element toxicity and material instability, that could hinder progress in this new scientific research field is carried out. Finally, the feasibility of and future challenges relating to this promising new technology are briefly introduced.
2. Construction of MHP-based photocatalytic systems
2.1. The composition of MHPs
The general structural formula of metal halide perovskite materials is ABX3 (Fig. 1a), where A is usually a monovalent cation (methylammonium (MA), formamidine (FA), or Cs), B is a divalent metal (such as Pb, Sn, Cu, or Ge), and X is a halogen (I, Br, or Cl).37 The ions at positions A, B, and C can be replaced isomorphically with other similar ions to change the electronic structure, defect properties, and catalytic performance of the crystal.38–41 Generally, perovskites exhibit a cubic lattice (space group: Pmm),42 but when the temperature decreases, they can transform into tetragonal (space group: I4/mcm)43 or orthorhombic (space group: Pnma)44 crystals. It can be seen from the crystal structure that the B cation and anion are firmly bound, while the interaction between the A cation and anion is weak. The difference between the ionic radii and electronegativities of the cations at the A and B sites will cause the BX6 octahedral structure to be distorted, resulting in weakening of the symmetry of the crystal structure. It has been confirmed that the tilt angle will affect the electronic band structure, and the carrier transport, photoluminescence, and dielectric properties of the perovskite crystal.45–47 The placing of different types of cations at the different lattice positions can be used to adjust these interactions to design different types of perovskite crystals with various characteristics.48,49

Since any change to the size of the A-site cations is capable of contracting or expanding the crystal lattice, adjustments may further adversely affect the symmetry of the structure and cause the deformation of the B–X bond,50 thereby altering the electronic properties of the perovskite.51–53 The cation at the A site may determine the orientation of the perovskite structure, thus its manipulation may lead to beneficial changes in the photoelectric properties.54 The organic cation methyl ammonium (MA+) with an effective radius of 2.17 Å is widely used in studies due to the resulting crystals having lower packing symmetry, a more suitable band gap, and higher photovoltaic conversion efficiency.51 The formamide cation with a larger effective radius (2.53 Å) produces a structural tolerance factor (an indicator of the viability of the perovskite structure for a given component combination) close to the ideal value of 1. However, when the A site is occupied by an organic cation (MA+ or FA+), the formed organic–inorganic hybrid MHP is unstable relative to the environment. In order to improve the material stability without reducing the electrochemical performance, inorganic metals could be used to effectively replace organic cations (all-inorganic MHPs), including smaller cations, such as Rb+ and Cs+, which are likely to contract the lattice structure.55–58
Generally, the B component is a divalent metal that is an element of group IVA (such as Pb, Sn, or Ge). The stability of the divalent oxidation states of the IVA elements can be reduced due to an enhancement of the electronegativity and covalent properties.54,59 The lone–pair 6s-state of Pb is very important for obtaining unique defect tolerance in MHPs. However, due to the instability of Pb-based MHPs to heat and moisture and the toxicity of Pb, great efforts have been made to replace Pb with other metals. Therefore, metal cations with lone–pair s-orbitals (such as In+, Tl+, Ge2+, Sn2+, Bi3+, and Sb3+) have been considered as replacements for Pb2+.60,61 Recently, an Sb-derivative two-dimensional layered perovskite, Cs3Sb2I9 (space group: P3m1), which is more stable in reaction environments than the similar perovskite CH3NH3PbI3, was shown to exhibit a band gap of 2.05 eV, becoming a very promising candidate medium-band-gap photocatalytic material.62 From the perspective of charge, Sb3+ in (Cs+)3(Sb3+)2(I−)9 shows a similar electronic structure to Pb2+ in CH3NH3PbI3.62 In addition, ion doping, especially doping with environmentally friendly ions (for example, Ca2+, Cu2+, and Mn2+), is an effective way to increase the stability of the material, optimize the performance of the device and maintain balance with the environment.63–67
The X position can be occupied by any halide anion, of which iodide, bromide, and chloride are the most frequently studied. The electronic properties of the element used may influence the position of the valence band of the resulting MHP. The valence band and related electronic binding energy of MHPs decrease from Cl to I, sequentially.54 Density functional theory (DFT) calculation results show that adding the halogen Br to the compound MAPbI3 will reposition the energy levels in its band structure, resulting in an increase in the band gap.68 Furthermore, the incorporation of Br leads to stronger Pb–Br bonds and a more compact and stable (pseudo-) cubic structure; the stability of the MHP is greatly improved at a relatively high Br content.69,70 However, the mixed halide MAPbBrxI3−x will undergo severe phase segregation under light, and uniform MAPbBrxI3−x will separate into an iodine-rich phase and an iodine-poor phase.71,72 Due to the significant difference in ionic radius between Cl and I, Cl can only be incorporated into MAPbI3 at very low levels.68 The mixing of Cl and I may be beneficial for the growth of crystal domains, resulting in a decrease in the number of grain boundaries, allowing charge carriers to move across the structure and reducing charge recombination in the system.54,73 The use of double anions was proposed to maintain the charge neutrality of the perovskite (such as MABi(SeI2) and MABi(SI2)), but further DFT calculations showed that the mixed-anion perovskite AB(Ch,X)3 (Ch = chalcogenide element; X = halogen) is thermodynamically unstable.74,75 Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a lot of in-depth research into the structures and compositions of MHPs to make huge breakthroughs in terms of photoelectric conversion.76–78
2.2. Light absorption of MHPs
Applying DFT calculations, in MPHs, the VBM is formed from an antibonding hybrid state between the 6s orbital of B and the np orbital of X (n for Cl, Br, and I is 3, 4, and 5, respectively), with the np orbital of X being attributed as the main contributor, while the CBM is composed of the antibonding hybrid state between the 6p orbital of B and the np orbital of X, with the main contribution coming from the 6p orbital of B.79,80 For example, the positions of the valence band and conduction band of CsPbBr3 QDs in the cubic phase are determined based on the 4p orbital of Br and the 6p orbital of Pb, respectively, while Cs has little effect on the energy band position.81 Since the A-site cation has no direct or significant effect on the VBM or CBM, the band gap of a MHP can be easily adjusted via mixing or exchanging B-site and X-site ions. For example, the absorption edge of a halide perovskite (approximately 700 nm for MAPbI3) is longer than an oxide perovskite (∼200 nm) or an oxynitride perovskite (∼650 nm). This red shifting of the absorption edge is caused by strong anti-bonding coupling between the B-site s orbital and the X-site p orbital.82
Generally, MHP is considered a direct band-gap semiconductor. However, spin–orbit coupling in MAPbI3 results in the conduction band undergoing Rashba splitting, which leads to a weak indirect band gap of 60 meV being presented during the direct band-gap transition.83 MHPs absorb almost the entire visible spectrum, which means that in photocatalytic applications charge carriers can be efficiently generated under lower energy excitation.12,54,84 The generation of the mixed halide perovskite MAPbX3−yIy (X = Cl, Br) is a practical strategy for realizing spectral absorption diversity with perovskite materials, and seamless band-gap tuning can be easily achieved.85 Protesescu et al. showed that the emission wavelength of CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, or I) can be shifted from 410 nm to 512 nm, and then up to 685 nm, upon only changing the halogen element at the X position from Cl to Br to I, respectively (Fig. 1b and c).85 However, according to the halogen composition, the edge of the valence band moves within a relatively large range of energy levels, while the edge of the conduction band shows only a small change.85,86
In addition, the B-site cation also plays a vital role in controlling the optical properties of MHPs, originating from the electronegativities of the metal elements.87 Due to environmental issues, Pb in MHPs will inevitably need to be replaced partially or completely. Compared with CsPbX3, the absorption and emission spectra of CsSnX3 show strong red shifts, from 443 nm (X = Cl) to 953 (X = I) (Fig. 1d).86 Within a certain range, the band gaps of MHPs can be designed and modified, aiming toward specific target energy levels. In addition, metal-ion doping methods have shown the potential to enhance the optical properties of halide perovskites. For example, the layered double perovskite Cs4CuSb2Cl12, obtained via doping Cu2+ and Sb3+ into the three octahedral layers, has the same semiconductor performance as MAPbI3, with a direct band gap of 1.0 eV, and its electrical conductivity is one order of magnitude higher.88 In addition, when Pb is partially replaced by Mn, this may cause a strong Stokes shift in the emission, thereby increasing the utilization rate of solar energy.89 However, when cations (Cd2+, Al2+, and Zn2+) are incorporated into the halide perovskite, causing shrinkage of the original MHP lattice, they may cause a blue shift of the absorption peak, a wide band gap, and lower absorption capacity.90–92
Intensive investigations have focused on A site mixing mainly because it does perform a unique role in charge compensation of the BX6 octahedra, based on the van der Waals forces between the inorganic B site cations. The effect of the A-site cation on the band gap is indirect and small. According to reports, with the transformation from inorganic cesium (Cs+) to organic MA+ and FA+ cations, as the size of the cation increases, the band gap of the corresponding MHP material will undergo a red shift.93 This phenomenon is attributed to an increase in the tilt angle of the metal–halogen bond and the deformation of the crystal structure.
Nanostructures can show unique optoelectronic properties due to quantum confinement effects. Larger crystallites exhibit smaller band-gaps and longer photogenerated carrier lifetimes, which are related to smaller radiation bimolecular recombination coefficients.94 The Stokes shift increases as the size of the MHP nanoparticle decreases, which is due to a confined-holes state being delocalized across the nanocrystal, indicating the size dependence of performance.54,95,96 On the other hand, when the dimensionality is reduced from 3D to 2D, 1D, or 0D, the band gap seems to increase. Low-dimensional perovskites also show quantum confinement effects and adjustable physical properties, and their better humidity stability is undoubtedly beneficial for realizing potential applications in photo(electro)-catalysis.97 Therefore, the control of the composition, structure, and dimensionality will affect the band gap of a MHP, thereby allowing a wide range of tunable emission and absorption characteristics to be obtained, from ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths.54,82 The electronic structure of a MHP crystal and the energy band structure formed via the hybridization of its metal and halogen orbitals can make it successful in photocatalytic applications.98
2.3. The basic principle of MHP photocatalysis
Redox reactions driven by photocatalytic materials usually involve three basic independent processes.1 (i) The photocatalyst absorbs photons with energies greater than or equal to the band gap, causing transitions between bands and forming photogenerated electrons and holes in the conduction band and valence band, respectively. Some of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs recombine in the bulk or at the surface of the photocatalyst within a few femtoseconds, releasing energy in the form of light or heat.99 (ii) Remaining charge carriers migrate to the reaction sites on the surface of the photocatalyst. (iii) Photo-generated holes and electrons undergo interfacial charge transfer to participate in oxidation and reduction reactions.100 Therefore, the total photocatalytic efficiency firstly depends on picosecond/nanosecond competition between carrier recombination and trapping, and secondly on micro/millisecond competition between charge carrier trapping and interfacial recombination.54,101 In order to allow the energy of light-excited charge carriers to drive corresponding catalytic reactions, the CB edge (or VB edge) of the semiconductor should be more negative (or positive) than the reduction (or oxidation) potential (Ered or Eox) of the substrate. Considering the overpotential associated with the photocatalytic reaction, the band gap of the semiconductor must be further widened. Taking these factors into account, the ideal band-gap range of semiconductors for photocatalytic applications is estimated to be 1.7–2.2 eV.102,103 The energy-band positions of most halide perovskites meet the thermodynamic requirements for reducing water and carbon dioxide (Fig. 1e).31,104 A comparison of the oxidation–reduction potentials of typical photocatalytic half-reactions related to water splitting, CO2 reduction, organic conversion, and dye degradation is given in Fig. 1e, with the relative positions of the MHP conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) potentials also shown, highlighting the excellent reduction abilities of MHPs. In other words, the relative positions of the CBs are usually sufficient to produce H2, reduce CO2, and produce superoxide radicals.31 Some members of the MHP family (such as all-inorganic CsPbBr3) can also theoretically achieve water oxidation because they have relatively positive valence band maximum (VBM) values. For the formation of hydroxyl radicals, related to dye degradation, the required potentials are higher than most MHP VBM values, so most MHPs are not suitable candidates.
Furthermore, factors such as the molar extinction coefficient, defect state, and charge transfer kinetics of a MHP also need to be considered in detail for photocatalytic applications.105–107 A high photocatalyst molar extinction coefficient (ε) is necessary to efficiently absorb visible light and generate excitons.108 The ε values of colloidal MHPs range from about 105–107 L mol−1 cm−1, an order of magnitude higher than the absorption coefficient of c-Si, and they are comparable to the absorption coefficients of a-Si:H and GaAs, which are representative materials in the photovoltaic field.109,110 This indicates that MHPs will have better visible light responses, so thinner materials can fully absorb light, which helps to improve photon-carrier conversion efficiencies.111 However, the extinction coefficient of a MHP also depends on the size of the perovskite crystals, especially in the nanometer size range (the quantification effect becomes very important), and this needs to be considered for actual optoelectronic applications.112 Whether a photocatalyst can effectively generate excitons after absorbing light is also important. After a photocatalytic material is excited by light, it will undergo various relaxation processes, such as non-radiative exciton cooling (EC), non-radiative recombination (NRR), and radiative recombination (RR). However, for some MHP quantum dots (such as MAPbI3 and FAPbI3), when they are excited by high-energy photons with energies at least twice the band-gap energy, the quantum dots may generate multiple excitons. This relaxation phenomenon is called MEG, where the excess energy of absorbed photons can be used to generate excitons (Fig. 2a).113,114 Since interacting particles are confined in a small volume next to each other, quantum confinement is expected to promote MEG. The time scales of these processes are arranged in the following order: multiple exciton generation (MEG) < exciton cooling (EC) < radiative recombination (RR) < non-radiative recombination (NRR), where MEG is in about the femtosecond range, EC is in the picosecond range, and RR and NRR occur in approximately nanosecond ranges. The relaxation effect of MEG in MHP quantum dots provides a strategy for the efficient use of high-energy photons in photocatalytic processes.115

Non-radiative recombination, another relaxation method, will compete with a photocatalytic reaction and consume photo-generated electron–hole pairs, which is not conducive to photocatalysis.116–119 Non-radiative recombination is a defect-induced charge carrier recombination process. Excessive defects in a photocatalyst material usually aggravate non-radiative recombination and shorten the carrier diffusion length. However, carrier transport in polycrystalline MHP films is relatively insensitive to a large number of defects, and the carrier diffusion lengths in solution-processed polycrystalline MHP films can reach about 100 nm.120 Generally, even a low concentration of intrinsic point defects may be harmful in traditional semiconductors (such as CdSe) (Fig. 2b, left).121 However, for MHPs, the effects of these defects on charge transfer and recombination are almost negligible due to their defect tolerance. “Defect tolerance” means that although the density of various defects is very high, the energy levels of the defects often lie within (or close to) the CB or VB, rather than within the band gap (Fig. 2b, right).122–124 Therefore, the defect tolerance of MHPs may enable them to show high carrier utilization efficiencies, thereby achieving high catalytic performance.125
The charge transfer kinetics of photogenerated carriers in MHPs are also crucial for their photocatalytic applications (Fig. 2c).125,126 Under light excitation, excitons and free carriers are rapidly generated and coexist, and the main light-excited species are free carriers. Most excitons are also quickly converted into free carriers. For example, the excitons in CsPbBr3 NCs quickly decompose into free charge carriers after 4–5 ps.127 These hot carriers relax to the edge of the energy band through carrier–carrier and carrier–phonon interactions within fs. As the size of the MHP nanocrystals increases, the cooling kinetics of hot carriers become faster.115 The longer hot carrier lifetimes in perovskites make carriers relatively easy to extract. Cooled charge carriers can undergo radiative recombination on a nanosecond time scale at the band edge. For CsPbBr3 NCs, the capture time of non-radiative carriers (electrons/holes) is about 40–50 ps.128 Due to the defect tolerance characteristics of MHPs, the carriers in their defects still have similar energies to edge carriers. This means that more high-energy carriers can potentially participate in photocatalysis. Carriers in CsPbBr3 can be effectively extracted by electron or hole acceptors in picoseconds, which indicates that extracted charges can be potentially used in photocatalytic reactions.129 The unique energy levels and charge transfer kinetics of MHPs lay good foundations for photocatalysis.125 In addition, the longer minority carrier diffusion lengths and charge mobility in MHPs are also crucial for the design of high-efficiency photocatalysts.125,127
From the viewpoint of photocatalysis, perovskite crystals provide unique advantages. (1) The band edge positions of the energy band structures are suitable for a wide range of photocatalytic redox reactions.31,130 (2) The diversity of A, B, and X sites in the crystal structure makes it possible to design targeted electronic structures and to tailor other physical properties, thereby improving light absorption (light collection from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared range can be achieved), charge migration, and stability.4,131 (3) Finally, some cutting-edge studies have shown that photocatalytic activities can be improved via combining ferroelectric and piezoelectric effects.132–135
2.4. Construction of MHP-based photocatalytic systems
One of the most commonly used photocatalyst systems based on MHPs is the photocatalyst particle suspension system.29 The photocatalytic reaction is carried out in a closed gas flow cell, which contains semiconductor particles as a photocatalyst, water as a source of protons or oxygen, sacrificial reagents for oxidation or reduction half-reactions (if necessary), and dissolved CO2 (if the system is being used to reduce CO2).29,136,137 Under light irradiation, the process of the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 is shown in Fig. 3a.

Since the ΔG° values of water splitting and CO2 reduction are 237 and 259 kJ mol−1, respectively, the theoretical band-gaps of the respective photocatalysts should be at least equal to 1.23 and 1.34 eV. Considering the overpotentials associated with photocatalytic reactions, the band gaps must be larger, but they should not limit the effective use of the solar spectrum. The ideal band-gap range is estimated to be 1.7–2.2 eV.138 Generally, perovskite halides thermodynamically support both reduction and oxidation reactions because their CBs and VBs span the H+/CO2 reduction and water oxidation potentials (Fig. 1e).31 For example, the band gap of MAPbI3 is 1.53 eV, and the minimum conduction band (CBM) and maximum valence band (VBM) potentials are −3.84 eV and −5.4 eV, respectively. Taking the standard hydrogen electrode (NHE) as a reference, the CBM and VBM potentials are determined to be −0.6 and 0.93 eV, which are suitable for H+ reduction (0.046 eV).139 However, in addition to the above-mentioned basic thermodynamic requirements, the actual photocatalytic system sometimes needs to use other co-catalytic components to eliminate the influence of a surface overpotential. In this case, a suitable electrocatalyst, such as Pt, NiP, RuO2, etc., is usually employed to extract electrons/holes from the semiconductor and promote the kinetics of the catalytic reaction.29 For photocatalyst particle suspension systems, instability issues related to water/humidity that are associated with MHPs must be considered, because the strong ionic bonding properties of MHPs mean they can be easily hydrated or decomposed by protic solvents.140 Therefore, researchers have made great efforts to develop water-stable perovskite materials and catalytic systems.141,142
The second type of photocatalytic system based on MHPs is the photoelectrode thin film system, also known as a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell.137 A typical photoelectrochemical cell consists of a working electrode (the photoelectrode), a counter electrode, and a reference electrode (Fig. 3b).29 The main photosensitive material in the photoelectrode is a MHP, which can be n-type or p-type.143 The ideal PEC redox reaction does not require any other external energy supply, and light energy is the energy source for catalytic reactions involving semiconductors with suitable band gaps and band edges. However, to date, few semiconductors can satisfactorily achieve this goal. When using a wide band-gap MHP or when the band edge of the MHP does not match the potential of the redox reaction, an additional voltage is needed to reduce electron–hole recombination in the electrode and promote the reaction.143 The photoelectrode structure greatly alleviates the harsh stability requirements of halide perovskites: water-impermeable, conductive, and even catalytic layers can be coated onto the MHP film. To date, many types of such layers have been realized, including nickel (8 nm), Field's metal, titanium foil, In–Bi alloy, and mesoporous carbon/graphite plate layers.29,34,35,144,145
The last type of photocatalytic system connects a solar photovoltaic cell and catalyst in series (Fig. 3c).29 The band gap tunability, ease of manufacturing, and large output voltage (>1 V) of perovskite solar cells make them excellent choices for powering photoelectric catalytic devices.146 So far, several photoanodes and photocathodes, including hematite, BiVO4, CdS, Cu2O, and CuInxGa1−xSe2, have been combined with perovskite solar cells (PV–PEC) to generate sufficient photovoltages to drive redox reactions without additional bias.147 Meanwhile, the use of a perovskite photovoltaic system combined with an electrocatalytic system (PV–EC) increases the efficiency of water splitting and CO2 reduction reactions to 12.3% and 6.5%, respectively.146,148 The considerable success achieved using PV–PEC and PV–EC systems suggests an attractive way to store solar energy.
3. Applications of MHP crystals in photocatalysis
3.1. MHP crystals for water splitting
Given the photophysical properties of MHPs, they seem to meet several important requirements that favor their use in photocatalytic reactions. However, as we know, halide perovskites are soluble in most polar solvents, including water.29 Fortunately, DMASnI3 (DMA = CH3NH2CH+) crystals have shown excellent water-phase stability (Fig. 4a).149 Inspired by this, DMASnI3 shows potential as a photocatalyst for H2 evolution in deionized water, with a rate of 0.64 μmol h−1 (200 mg of catalyst) and good recycling performance. Subsequently, shell-coated CsPbBr3-core/TiO2-shell NCs were synthesized via encapsulating colloidal CsPbBr3 NCs in a titanium precursor and then calcining at 300 °C (Fig. 4b).150 The almost monodisperse CsPbBr3/TiO2 NCs exhibit excellent stability in water for at least three months. Their size, structure, morphology, and optical properties remain unchanged, making them one of the most water-stable inorganic-shell-passivation perovskite NC examples. Although MAPbI3 has an appropriate electronic structure, its instability under humid conditions has always been the biggest obstacle to its use in the HER process. Park et al. achieved an amazing breakthrough, using MAPbI3 as a photocatalytic material in dynamically balanced HI solution (Fig. 4c).32 MAPbI3 is considered to be an ionic crystal composed of MA+ and PbI3−, which can be precipitated in saturated solutions. Therefore, when MAPbI3 precipitates are in saturated solution, they can decompose into MA+ and PbI3− ions. At the same time, the MA+ and PbI3− ions in solution re-precipitate on crystals at the same rate, so MAPbI3 powder remains stable in HI aqueous solution (Fig. 4d). The authors also found that, depending on the concentrations of I− and H+, MAPbI3 can exist in different phases, but the MAPbI3 phase is only stable under the following specific conditions: [I−] ≤ [H+]; pH < −0.5; and −log[I−] < −0.4 (Fig. 4e). In some studies, photocatalytic hydrogen production utilizing metal halide perovskites in HX (X = Cl, Br, or I) solution has been adopted to replace direct water splitting for hydrogen evolution to achieve better system stability and efficiency.151,152 Compared with water splitting, which involves four electrons, the reduction of HI is a two-electron reaction, and the overpotential required for the oxidation of I− is close to zero.153–156

MHPs can show modified CBM and VBM potentials as a result of changes in their own compositions, which is suitable for gradient photocatalysis. MAPbBr3−xIx achieves a band gap with a funnel structure with changes in the iodide concentration gradient, promoting the transfer of charge from the interior to the surface.157 As the I concentration increases from the inside to the surface, the CBM becomes more positive (while the VBM becomes more negative), thereby constructing a smooth funnel for the movement of photogenerated carriers (Fig. 4f). The band-gap funnel significantly increases the rate of H2 generation, which reaches 255.3 μmol h−1. When Pt is further added to the system to effectively separate photogenerated electron–hole pairs, the generation rate of H2 is further increased to 651.2 μmol h−1. The thermal annealing treatment of MAPbI3 in dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) resulted in the generated amount of H2 being significantly increased: 2-fold in DMF and 2.8-fold in DMSO.32 Since this crystal growth method contributes to improved crystallinity, the increased catalytic performance is attributed to the reduction of recombination sites and the promotion of carrier diffusion.158 After a Pt cocatalyst was deposited on MAPbI3, the best H2 production rate achieved was 57 μmol g−1 h−1 and the HI decomposition efficiency was 0.81%. Due to the large absorption coefficient (105 cm−1) of MHPs in the visible-light range, H2 can be produced under low-power illumination of 0.5 mW cm−2 (Fig. 4g).32,108
Wu et al. designed heterostructured MAPbI3/rGO (Fig. 4h).159 Its H2 release rate under visible light irradiation is extremely high, 93.9 μmol h−1 in aqueous HI solution, and its activity is 67 times higher than that of pure MAPbI3.159 In addition, the composite material is highly stable, and the catalytic activity did not decrease significantly after 200 h (i.e., 20 cycles) of H2 evolution experiments. The excellent performance is attributed to the existence of rGO, which makes charge transfer in MAPbI3/rGO faster and allows the electron–hole pairs to be more effectively separated.160 In addition, because rGO has a large specific surface area, when it serves as a reaction scaffold it leads to an increase in the number of active sites for catalytic reactions. Wang et al. hybridized MAPbBr3 with Pt/Ta2O5 and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) nanoparticles, using these as electron- and hole-transport channels, respectively. The formation rate of hydrogen is increased approximately 52-fold.161 This is attributed to the improvement of the charge separation and transfer efficiency of MAPbBr3 by providing a new double charge transfer path. Tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) is considered to have an ideal conduction band edge for transferring electrons from MAPbBr3, so Pt/Ta2O5–MAPbBr3 contributes to an increase in the HER rate. Since the VBM of PEDOT:PSS is more positive than that of MAPbBr3, it was selected as an effective hole transport material for the Pt/Ta2O5–MAPbBr3 hybrid system, which is conducive to the Br-oxidation reaction. Therefore, Pt/Ta2O5–MAPbBr3–PEDOT:PSS is a most effective photocatalytic system for the HER (Fig. 4i).161 Similarly, the hybridization of Pt/TiO2 nanoparticles with MAPbI3 dynamically creates electron transmission channels. The charge transfer efficiency of MAPbI3 nanoparticles is greatly improved, and the photocatalytic hydrogen release rate upon HI decomposition is increased by about 20%, 89 times that of Pt/MAPbI3. The apparent quantum efficiency of H2 released at 420 nm is about 70%, and the obtained solar-to-chemical conversion efficiency is about 0.86%.161,162 In this system, MAPbI3 plays a major role in light absorption, sensitizing TiO2 in a similar fashion to traditional sensitization systems (Fig. 4j). Although MAPbI3 can increase the rate of H2 generation, it is easily dissolved in solution (Fig. 4k).163–165
Photoelectrocatalysis (PEC) reaction systems driven by light and electricity are also widely used in the HER and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The simultaneous action of photocatalysis and electrocatalysis can promote the separation and migration of carriers, reduce the carrier recombination rate, promote the oxidation–reduction kinetics, and improve catalytic efficiency.166,167 PEC based on halide perovskites has attracted more and more attention as a potential next-generation water splitting approach.
Hybrid perovskite photoelectrodes are usually unstable in solvents, and their performance drops to almost 0 mA cm−2 within 1 h of operation, showing low long-term operational stability. Therefore, a protective layer must be used on a halide perovskite photoelectrode. Andrei et al. used a nickel hole-transport layer to produce a Field's-metal-epoxy-encapsulated photoanode based on Cs–FA–MA salt, and they obtained an unbiased solar-hydrogen efficiency of 0.35 ± 0.14% and increased the stabilization period to 20 h.168 In addition, a breakthrough was achieved in increasing the device size from 0.25 cm2 to 10 cm2. Due to the increase in series resistance, the photocurrent density was only slightly reduced (from 0.39 ± 0.15 to 0.23 ± 0.10 mA cm−2). Crespo-Quesada et al. used a Field's metal to simply encapsulate a photocathode based on CH3NH3PbI3, adding Pt as a co-catalyst, and the ultimately obtained photocathode can continuously produce H2 in a mild neutral electrolyte for more than 2 h (Fig. 5a).34 Water splitting to produce hydrogen or oxygen needs to overcome a large overpotential. In order to overcome this overpotential, many precious metals have been incorporated into the photoelectrode, such as Pt, RuO2, and IrO2. However, rare-metal catalysts are expensive and have low storage capacities. Metallic nickel, as an affordable co-catalyst and physical passivation barrier, was deposited on MAPbI3 as a photoanode.144 The photoanode exhibited a photocurrent density of over 10 mA cm−2 in 0.1 M Na2S at 0 V versus Ag/AgCl, and the photocurrent could be maintained above 2 mA cm−2 for only 15–20 min. Nam et al. applied a peeling process to encapsulate photoelectrodes based on MHPs to achieve more precise size-control of the required shape and to add layers with specific protective and photocatalytic functions. As a result, the prepared devices show a significant increase in water oxidation performance and have excellent long-term stability in strongly oxidizing electrolytes.169 Zhang et al. reported a photocathode with a sandwich-like structure based on CH3NH3PbI3 (Fig. 5b).145 Compared with the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), its onset potential is 0.95 V, and the photocurrent density is about 18 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE (Fig. 5c); even after 12 h of operation, the ideal proportional power conservation efficiency is about 7.63%145 (Table 1).

Carbon materials have also been used as protective layers for halide perovskites. A (5-AVA)x(MA)1−x PbI3 [5-AVA = HOOC(CH2)4 NH3+]-based photoanode encapsulated with conductive carbon paste and silver conductive paint was used for water oxidation (Fig. 5e).178 The photoanode achieved a high photocurrent density of 12.4 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V (relative to RHE) and remained stable in alkaline electrolyte for more than 48 h. This high stability is mainly due to the insulating effect of the thick carbon layer covering the halide perovskite. In order to further improve the stability of MHPs in strong acid electrolytes, Kim et al. used phenyl C61 methyl butyrate and TiO2 film as a mixed electron transport layer to manufacture an acid-resistant photocathode, which can be used in 0.5 mol L−1 H2SO4 electrolyte.180 Hot graphite sheets and mesoporous carbon stents were used to encapsulate a CsPbBr3 photoanode (Fig. 5f).174 Under constant simulated sunlight, a record of maintaining a current above 2 mA cm−2 (1.23 V relative to RHE) in aqueous electrolyte for 30 h is achieved. In addition, by using an Ir-based water oxidation catalyst (WOC) to functionalize the surface of the graphite sheets, the onset potential of the composite photoanode was shifted negatively by 100 mV. A PV–photoanode system was developed to improve the absorption of solar photons. In this PV–photoanode system, BiVO4 was used as a photoanode and connected in series with a single CH3NH3PbI3 cell (Fig. 5d).181 This unique configuration enables efficient solar photon management, where the metal oxide photoanode selectively collects high-energy visible photons while the perovskite solar cell below captures lower-energy near-infrared IR waves under single-pass excitation. Once the charge carriers are induced by solar energy, the extra energy from the PV cell can promote the reduction of protons, thereby helping the water splitting process. This photoanode–photovoltaic architecture, together with the use of an earth-abundant cobalt phosphate catalyst, can achieve a solar energy conversion rate of 2.5% at neutral pH.
3.2. MHP crystals for CO2 reduction
The use of renewable solar energy to photochemically reduce CO2, converting solar energy into chemical energy in the form of chemical bonds, has a bright future and has attracted great interest in the scientific and technological community.182–184 However, the main limitation regarding the use of CO2 is the high chemical stability of CO bonds; the dissociation energy is higher than 805 kJ mol−1, so a large amount of energy input is required for bond cleavage in order to realize CO2 conversion.184,185 In fact, the CBs of many perovskites are at a sufficient level to meet the requirements of CO2 reduction, but it is difficult for pure perovskites to stably exist in aqueous solutions. In order to maintain a successful and sustainable photocatalytic process using perovskites, a promising method is to wrap the perovskite in a suitable material to physically separate it from water (Fig. 6a).186 In order to effectively protect the perovskite while allowing for the diffusion of the matrix, a hydrophobic MOF is preferred. Wu et al. used an Fe-doped PCN-221 MOF with large internal voids to accommodate methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) quantum dots.187 The MOF not only protects MAPbI3 from water dissolution (Fig. 6b), but it also acts as a co-catalyst to accelerate the CO2 reduction process. Kong et al. prepared a zeolite imidazole salt framework (ZIF) in situ on CsPbBr3 quantum dots (QDs) to make a CsPbBr3@ZIF core–shell structure. The CsPbBr3@ZIF composite material is active and stable for photocatalytic CO2 reduction in the presence of CO2 and H2O vapor, and the electron consumption rates of CsPbBr3@ZIF-8 and CsPbBr3@ZIF-67 are 15.5 and 29.6 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively.188 The 2-methylimidazole salt ligand on ZIF-67 shows good affinity for CO2 molecules, so it is favorable for the reaction kinetics (Fig. 6c).188 Photocatalysis on a single semiconductor often results in a high charge-recombination rate. In light of this, a gold salt was added to a CsPbBr3 nanocrystalline system to assist in the preparation of Au/CsPbBr3 nanostructures (Fig. 6d).189 As a result, Au enhanced the separation of excitons and reduced recombination, providing the possibility of enhancing the performance of Au/CsPbBr3 nanojunctions in actual photocatalysis (Table 2).

The ionic nature of MHPs makes them particularly sensitive to polar molecules and easily degraded. Therefore, low polarity solvents can be used to create stable photocatalytic CO2 reaction conditions. Under such environmental conditions, the relatively weak dipole moment of the solvent does not allow easy coordination with MHP crystals to dissociate them into ionic species complexes.31 According to reports, acetonitrile and a trace amount of water (0.3% (volume)) can be used as a reaction solution for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 utilizing halide perovskites.196 Hou et al. showed that CsPbBr3 QDs/g-C3N4 catalyzed CO2 in acetonitrile/H2O under visible light irradiation, obtaining a CO generation rate of 149 μmol g−1 h−1. Sun et al. also used a low-polarity solvent, ethyl acetate, mixed with trace water (volume ratio: 300:1) (Fig. 6e).190 As expected, CsPbBr3 QDs with high selectivity of greater than 99% achieve an efficient yield of 20.9 μmol g−1 during solar CO2 reduction. Water acts as a hole sacrificial agent to generate oxygen, but it also decomposes into hydrogen to compete with the CO2 reduction reaction. Xu et al. made a compound of perovskite halide CsPbBr3 QDs and GO, and photocatalytically reduced CO2 to ethyl acetate through artificial photosynthesis (Fig. 6f).33 It is worth noting that ethyl acetate supports the stability of CsPbBr3 due to its soft polarity, and it increases the solubility of CO2 7-fold compared with water.201 Under AM 1.5G simulated illumination, CsPbBr3 QDs stably generate electrons and inject them into CO2 to catalyze CO2 reduction at a rate of 23.7 μmol g−1 h−1, with selectivity of over 99.3%. The electron consumption rates of CsPbBr3 QDs/GO and CsPbBr3 QDs were determined to be 357.4 and 284.7, respectively, highlighting the enhancement of catalysis upon the introduction of GO as a catalyst support. 2D MXene was proved to have a similar promoting effect to GO; CsPbBr3 NCs/MXene nanocomposites have high CO and CH4 formation rates of 26.32 and 7.25 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively.191 Using a mixed halide strategy, under simulated sunlight without a photosensitizer, the activity of the all-inorganic perovskite for CO2 reduction is sharply enhanced (Fig. 6g),193 while high selectivity is maintained during CO and CH4 generation. For the optimized catalyst CsPb (Br0.5/Cl0.5)3, the total yield of CO and CH4 reaches 875 μmol g−1 (selectivity is 99%), which is 4.5 to 9.1 times higher than CsPbBr3 and CsPbCl3, respectively, under the same conditions. However, the increased Cl content will reduce the visible light response of the material. This indicates the need to find a balance between stability and activity/photoresponse in the case of MHP photocatalysts. Kuang et al. found that lead-free perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs can reduce CO2 in pure ethyl acetate (Fig. 6h).200 Cs2AgBiBr6 double-perovskite NCs exhibit impressive stability in response to moisture, light, and temperature. Applying this type of material to photocatalytic CO2 reduction for 6 h under AM 1.5G illumination, the total electron consumption obtained is 105 μmol g−1, while 5.5 and 0.65 μmol g−1 CO and CH4 were produced, respectively.
There are few reports on the use of photoelectrodes based on halide perovskites for CO2 reduction. Encouragingly, Chen et al. recently demonstrated a MAPbI3-based photocathode involving an In–Bi alloy coating for selective CO2 reduction in aqueous solution. The catalytic, protective, and conductive coating was integrated into a MAPbI3 photovoltaic cell in the prototype photoelectrochemical device, and the In–Bi–Sn alloy with an In- and Bi-rich surface shows the highest FE for HCOOH production in this material system. This extremely high performance is due to the low adsorption energies involving the In, Bi, and In5Bi3 phases toward HCOO*. The Faraday efficiency (FE) for the production of formic acid in aqueous solution is close to 100% (Fig. 6i).35 Under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation, the photocathode operated at −0.6 V (relative to RHE) for more than 1.5 h and achieved a photo-assisted electrolysis efficiency of 7.2%.
3.3. MHP crystals for organic conversion and pollutant degradation
The intentional construction of organic compounds through low-cost and effective photocatalysis is highly desirable. At present, significant progress has been made in the formation of C–C, C–O, and CN bonds, which are of great significance in drug development and material synthesis.202–206 The surfaces of MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 perovskites have low inherent surface recombination speeds, indicating the excellent defect tolerance of perovskites; this property is beneficial for promoting the surface chemical reactions required by these photocatalytic systems.207–209 Zhu et al. proved that low-cost, easy-to-process, high-efficiency, air-resistant, and adjustable-band-edge perovskite nanocrystals are powerful candidates to act as photocatalysts for basic organic reactions (such as the formation of C–C, C–N, and C–O bonds).4 The photocatalytic α-alkylation of aldehydes using perovskites successfully proved that the C–C bond formation reaction can be effectively achieved.210 The stability of CsPbBr3 in organic solvents and its easy-to-adjust band-gap edge enable it to activate a wider range of organic substrates. In fact, the same catalytic system was also evaluated for the photocatalytic thiol formation of symmetric and asymmetric disulfides.211 Recently, Tüysüz et al. confined Cs3Bi2Br9 nanoparticles within the large, ordered channels of mesoporous silica SAB-15 and used this complex for the aliphatic and aromatic CH activation of bonds to develop the corresponding aldehydes and ketones. The composite photocatalyst can effectively oxidize hydrocarbons (C5 to C16, including aromatic and aliphatic alkanes) with a conversion rate of up to 32900 μmol gcat−1 h−1 and excellent selectivity (>99%) towards aldehydes and ketones under visible light irradiation.212 Lead-free Cs3Bi2Br9, with low toxicity and high stability in air, has recently shown excellent high activity and selectivity during photocatalytic organic synthesis driven by sunlight.213 The reasons for these unexpected catalytic abilities are the photocatalytic process and the presence of appropriate Lewis acid centers on the surface of the photocatalyst, resulting in higher activity relative to lead-based perovskites. Roeffaers et al. reported the use of a MHP as a photocatalyst for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol in non-polar toluene solution (Fig. 7a).214 Within 8 h of irradiation, the conversion rate using FAPbBr3 particles is about 15% and the selectivity is close to 100% (0.1 mmol of benzyl alcohol in 2.5 mL of toluene). Via modifying FAPbBr3 into an FAPbBr3/TiO2 hybrid nanomaterial through in situ anti-solvent growth, the highest conversion rate of benzyl alcohol can be achieved after optimization: 4 times the original. An all-inorganic halide perovskite CsPbBr3/TiO2 composite material that catalyzes the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde under visible-light illumination was also achieved, and CsPbBr3 demonstrated good stability in terms of its morphology and crystal structure under the reaction conditions.215 A three-component hybrid perovskite-based solar photocatalyst cell, NiOx/FAPbBr3/TiO2, was employed to photoactivate the C(sp3)–H bonds in aromatic hydrocarbons and form the corresponding alcohols and aldehydes.216 Adding an electron transport layer (TiO2) and a hole transport layer (NiOx) can optimize the conversion efficiency when using MHP photocatalysts via improving the charge separation characteristics, and the TiO2/FAPbBr3/NiOx system realizes the activation of the C(sp3)–H bonds in toluene with high selectivity (∼90%) and a high conversion rate of toluene to benzaldehyde (3800 μmol g−1 h−1). CsPbI3 QDs can be used as catalysts to promote the polymerization of 2,2′,5′,2′′-ter-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene under visible-light illumination while preserving the quantum dots in the desirable cubic crystal phase (Fig. 7b).110 Simultaneously, the generated conducting poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), PEDOT, encapsulates and stabilizes the morphology of the CsPbI3 QDs. The photocatalytic polymerization clearly depends on the concentration of CsPbI3 QDs, and the CsPbI3 QDs remain in the desirable perovskite phase when the concentration of QDs is increased. Molecular oxygen and 1,4-benzoquinone can serve as electron acceptors during the photocatalytic polymerization reaction. In addition, Tan et al. tested the stability of lead-based MHPs protected by high molecular weight polymers completely immersed in water, further proving the success of these materials for use in light-activated organic synthesis.217

Since organic pollutants discharged by industry are considered to be a serious threat to human health and ecosystems, MHPs are also used as very effective photocatalysts in many light-driven organic pollutant degradation reactions (including wastewater treatment), which consist of the potential mineralization of organic matter or the complete degradation of organic matter into CO2 and H2O or non-toxic substances. Huang et al. prepared CsPb(Br1−xClx)3–Au NCs, which were used for the degradation of Sudan Red III in toluene.218 Dissolved O2 can be captured by photoelectrons on CsPb(Br1−xClx)3 to generate superoxide anion radicals (˙O2−), while Au NCs can act as hole-storage pools to enhance the surface production of hydroxyl radicals.218 Afterwards, Sudan Red III reacts with these two free radical types to produce non-toxic products. Under visible light irradiation, 71% of Sudan Red III was degraded by CsPb(Br1−xClx)3–Au within 6 h, which was three times that when using CsPb(Br1−xClx)3 (Fig. 7c). Malavasi et al. used a composite of a water-resistant lead-free 2D perovskite (PEA2SnBr4) and graphite carbon nitride, PEA2SnBr4/g-C3N4, for the degradation of organic dye (methylene blue) in an aqueous environment, and the composite material significantly improves the methylene blue degradation efficiency.219 Furthermore, Zhang et al. successfully developed an alcohol-based photocatalytic system to achieve dye degradation using Cs2AgBiBr6 to harvest visible light. It was found that Cs2AgBiBr6 retains high chemical stability in ethanol during photocatalytic processes. Studies of the photocatalytic degradation process involving four different dyes reveal that the dye molecules undergo a complete mineralization process and that the main active species is the superoxide radical (˙O2−). The degradation process exhibits pseudo-zeroth-order reaction kinetics in the case of Cs2AgBiBr6, which implies that the photoinitiation and surface catalysis processes on Cs2AgBiBr6 play dominant roles in the photocatalytic degradation of dyes. Furthermore, the deposition of Pt or Au facilitates the transfer of photogenerated electrons from Cs2AgBiBr6 to the metal centers, and the photocatalytic degradation rate increases about two-fold in the case of rhodamine-B degradation. Finally, Cs2AgBiBr6 shows good stability, with no obvious decrease in photodegradation efficiency over five runs of the photocatalytic reaction.220 Gao et al. reported the photoactivities of MHPs for the degradation of organic dyes in 2017.221 An all-inorganic CsPbX3 HP was prepared via an emulsion method at room temperature, and it was then used for the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange (MO) in solution. When using 2 mg of CsPbCl3 as the photocatalyst, MO degradation reached 90% within 80 min. At the same time, under dark conditions, only 17% of MO was degraded, which proved the photocatalytic degradation activity of CsPbX3. Gao et al. believe that when light irradiates CsPbX3, light-excited electrons and holes are generated in its CB and VB to form ˙O2− and ˙OH, and that these ˙O2− and ˙OH radicals are responsible for dye degradation.221 Interestingly, Reyes-Pérez et al. successfully synthesized cubic and tetragonal CsSnBr3 MHPs. These MHPs exhibit good light absorption properties in the visible spectrum range of 400–700 nm. Using these MHPs to remove crystal violet dyes, the maximum adsorption and photodegradation percentages obtained toward crystal violet dye were 22% and 73.1%, respectively.222
The polarity of the reaction solvent also affects MHP-based photocatalytic organic conversion. Soo et al. synthesized 2D Pb and Sn halide perovskite ((HAD)2PbI4 and (HAD)2SnI4) crystallites via intercalating the long-chain alkyl 1-hexadecylammonium (HDA) between the inorganic layers.223 Owing to their hydrophobicity and stability in humid air, these MHPs were applied to the decarboxylation and dehydrogenation of indoline-2-carboxylic acid in DCM. The (HAD)2SnI4 structure exhibits poor performance compared to (HAD)2PbI4 due to the self-oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ (Fig. 7e). Yan et al. proved that MAPbBr3 and CsPbBr3 nanocrystals can selectively form C–C bonds in the α-alkylation reaction of aldehydes in DCM, THF, and dioxane under photocatalysis (Fig. 7d).210 In ethyl acetate, CsPbBr3 can form pyrazole and pyrrole through direct N heterocycles under blue light irradiation to form C–N bonds. Using a nickel co-catalyst, under blue light irradiation, C–O bonds are formed via aryl esterification in the presence of CsPbBr3 in THF. In addition, CsPbBr3 QDs can drive the oxidation of MBT (2-mercaptobenzothiazole) in hexane through photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis.224 Wu et al. used CsPbX3 (where X = Cl, Br, and I) NCs in DCM to achieve S–H bond activation.211 The photo-catalyzed thiol coupling reactions selectively produced symmetric and unsymmetric disulfides in high yields (isolated yields of 68–96%). Additionally, the perovskite-catalyzed phosphonylation of tertiary amines via visible-light-mediated cross-dehydrogenative coupling reactions was discovered to occur with good isolated yields (50–96%). When the hybrid perovskite is combined with the highly chemically and thermally stable semiconductor g-C3N4, protonated g-C3N4 (p-g-C3N4) exhibits different characteristics in terms of the energy bands and optical and electronic properties.225 In addition, the conduction bands of p-g-C3N4 (−3.66 eV to vacuum) and MAPbBr3 (−3.43 eV to vacuum) will cause electrons to be transferred from MAPbBr3 to p-g-C3N4 with longer carrier lifetimes. Therefore, a heterostructure of MAPbBr3/p-g-C3N4 under visible light shows robustness for the photoreduction of p-nitrophenol (PNP) (Fig. 7f–h).225
4. Obstacles facing the use of MHPs as photocatalysts
4.1. Instability limits of MHP photocatalysts
Due to the “softness” of the crystal structures, the photoelectric properties of MHPs will change significantly under the effects of phase changes, heat, stress, ambient air exposure (oxygen and moisture), and lighting (ultraviolet rays), resulting in the degradation of MHP catalyst activities. Ionic interactions between the charged components in MHP crystals makes their surface structures susceptible to change when they come into contact with polar additives.31,226 When a MHP is exposed to polar solvents, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), the perovskite structure will also degrade and form coordination compounds through van der Waals interactions, e.g., PbI2(DMSO)2 and MAI–PbI2–DMSO. Rapid intramolecular exchange between DMSO and FAI in FAPbI3 leads to the immediate decomposition of the perovskite structure (Fig. 8a). Compared with non-coordinating polar solvents (such as acetonitrile), solid solution perovskite films made from polar coordinating solvents (such as DMF, DMSO, and γ-butyrolactone) have many obvious defects. This is due to the tendency of the coordination solvent to be more easily embedded during the formation of the perovskite film.227 Direct contact with highly polar environments should be minimized or efforts should be made to achieve an intrinsically stable MHP to resist damaging effects during exposure to polar solvents. For example, it was found that CsPbBr3 nanocrystals are more stable in polar solvents, such as isopropanol, ethyl acetate, methyl acetate, and acetonitrile, which is encouraging for a large number of photo-redox catalytic reactions.224
 Fig. 8  (a) An illustration of the vulnerability of MHP surfaces during photocatalytic reactions when exposed to polar solvents (e.g., DMSO) and water. Polar molecules undergo rapid intramolecular exchange with organic cations, causing the immediate degradation of the perovskite chemical structure. Water molecules degrade MHPs in a stepwise fashion, where, initially, a monohydrate perovskite structure is formed, which later decomposes into non-perovskite structures through different intermediates.

The volatile hygroscopic amine salts contained in organic–inorganic hybrid MHPs, MA+/FA+ cations, cause water instability.228–231 Since MA+ and FA+ are acidic, they can provide protons to water molecules, which can break the hydrogen bond between the A site and the lead halide octahedron ([PbX6]4−), thereby releasing volatile CH3NH2 and decomposing the perovskite structure.232 However, other studies have shown that hydrogen bonds are formed between H2O and [PbX6]4− octahedrons. If these hydrogen bonds are stronger than those formed between [PbX6]4− octahedrons and A-site cations, the MHP tends to hydrate, forming the hydrated perovskite phases CH3NH3PbI3·H2O and (CH3NH3)4PbI6·2H2O (Fig. 8a).233,234 Interestingly, via exposing a hydrated perovskite to a dry environment, the formation of the monohydrate phase can be completely reversed.235 However, longer exposure times or exposure to higher H2O vapor pressures can quickly cause irreversible damage to the MHP. The hydration reaction of the perovskite film was proved to be the first step in the decomposition process of the perovskite, rather than acid–base reactions involving organic amine cations.229,230 This indicates that strengthening the hydrogen bond interactions between the organic cations and the metal halide octahedrons and/or weakening the hydrogen interactions between the organic cations and H2O can improve the moisture resistance. Substituting inorganic Cs+ for an organic cation at the A position leads to the formation of an all-inorganic chemical structure, which greatly improves the moisture resistance and heat stability.236,237 In addition, the existence of a hydrated perovskite phase has no significant effect on the short-term (<1.5 ns) charge carrier dynamics of MAPbI3, which is attributed to the unique defect-tolerating physical properties of MHPs.229,230
MHP materials are not easily oxidized in the ground state, but they are easily oxidized when excited by light. When molecular oxygen accepts light-excited electrons from the perovskite conduction band, superoxide anions are formed. These superoxide anions can then deprotonate ammonium salt cations, thereby decomposing the MHP into lead halides and organic amines.238,239 In particular, under high-energy ultraviolet light, trap states are easy to generate and they induce an increase in the generation of superoxide anions.235 In addition, light absorption in a MHP triggers the process of charge transfer from the halide to the metal, which reduces the charge density at the X position, thereby weakening the CH3NH3⋯X hydrogen bond interactions and increasing the degradation rate under a humid atmosphere.216 The long-term exposure of MHP quantum dots to light radiation will cause the generation of halogen vacancy–halogen interstitial pairs, causing the halogen to migrate to the surface of the material where it is then trapped by the ion surface, leading to ligand desorption and crystal regeneration. The thermal stability of a MHP is also closely related to the organic amine salts. The organic thermal sublimation mechanism of perovskite compounds involves the initial escape of HI gas, followed by the organic conjugate base (CH3NH2 or NHCHNH2).133,240 The more acidic the organic cation, the stronger the interaction with the halide, and the higher the chance that the organic cation can be deprotonated to generate HI (or HBr) and the conjugated organic base. Since the acidity of MA is greater than the acidity of larger FA, the thermal decomposition of FA-based perovskites will slow down. Substituting Cs for volatile MA cations can also significantly improve the thermal stability.
4.2. Toxicity of “Pb” in MHPs
The instability toward heat and moisture and, in particular, the toxicity of Pb2+ are bottlenecks preventing the use of lead-based MHPs for practical applications.241,242 Even under extremely low exposure conditions, lead can cause serious health problems, including nerve damage, kidney failure, and impaired brain development.243 Therefore, it is necessary to find low-toxicity elements to replace lead in MHPs without damaging the original excellent optical properties.244,245
In order to maintain the unique “defect tolerance” of MHPs, the metal cations that replace lead tend to have lone–pair s orbitals like Pb 6s, such as Ge2+, Sn2+, Bi3+, and Sb3+. It is generally believed that Sn2+ is a suitable substitute for Pb2+. However, compared with MAPbI3, MASnI3 shows stronger s–p anti-bonding coupling near the VBM, which is due to the fact that the Sn 5s lone–pair state is shallower and more active than the Pb 6s lone–pair state. Therefore, MASnI3 is extremely unstable toward oxygen and moisture, leading to unexpected doping and rapid decomposition.246,247 Divalent Ge2+ has also been considered to replace Pb2+ to form lead-free iodide perovskites. However, the small ionic radius (0.73 Å) of Ge2+ means that Ge2+ cations cannot be stabilized at the octahedral center of I−, which limits their application in photocatalysis.248 Trivalent Bi3+ and Sb3+ cations have also been used to replace the Pb2+ cation at the B position to form lead-free perovskites, due to their lone–pair s orbitals (Fig. 8b).62,249,250 The band gap of Cs3Sb2I9 is about 2.0 eV, which is a value suitable for photocatalysis. However, all point defects of the layered perovskite Cs3Sb2I9, except Csi and VCs, produce deep-level states in the band gap, which may become non-radiative recombination centers that are not conducive to photocatalysis. As for Cs3Bi2I9, its band gap is 2.86 eV, so its absorption of visible light is relatively limited. Due to the large band gap and high-density carrier recombination, it was later proved that the performances of these low-dimensional products were poor.62
The direct replacement of Pb2+ does not seem to bring about the ideal photocatalyst that can perfectly perform photocatalytic tasks. Therefore, the use of halide double perovskites whose 3D structures have been reported, including A2AgInX6 (A = Cs, Rb, Na; X = Cl, Br, I), A2AgBiX6 (A = Cs, Rb, Na; X = Cl, Br, I), and A2NaInX6 (A = Cs, Rb; X = Cl, Br), has become a feasible strategy for obtaining 3D lead-free perovskite photocatalytic materials.251–253 For example, lead-free Cs2AgBiBr6 (2Pb2+ → Ag+ + Bi3+) double perovskite nanocrystals have an indirect band gap of 1.95 eV and high crystallinity, and they exhibit impressive stability in response to moisture, light, and high temperatures. Cs2AgBiBr6 nanocrystals with a suitable CBM can effectively convert CO2 into solar fuel under AM 1.5G illumination for 6 h.200 After constant irradiation for 6 h, pristine Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs could allow the evolution of CO and CH4 at rates of 5.5 and 0.65 μmol g−1, respectively. A combination of the lead-free perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 with RGO can be used to release H2 from saturated HBr aqueous solution.170 RGO promotes the separation and transfer of charge, so Cs2AgBiBr6/RGO can produce up to 489 μmol g−1 H2 within 10 h under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm, 300 W Xe lamp). In addition, the outstanding photocatalyst Cs2AgBiBr6/2.5% RGO shows high stability over 120 h of continuous photocatalytic H2 release. The layered double perovskite Cs4CuSb2Cl12, obtained via incorporating Cu2+ and Sb3+ into three octahedron-thick layers, has conductivity that is one order of magnitude larger than that of MAPbI3. In addition, it has light stability and thermal stability, and it is resistant to humidity; these are desirable characteristics of photocatalysts. This material represents a new type of layered perovskite structure, combining metals in 2+ and 3+ oxidation states, thereby significantly broadening the possible combinations of metals that can replace lead in PSCs. The direct band gap of the Tl+-based double perovskite (MA)2TlBiBr6 is about 2.16 eV, but Tl is much more toxic than Pb so it is not suitable for most photocatalytic applications.254
Double perovskites have two types of surfaces. First-principles calculations have been used to reveal the band structures and thermodynamic stabilities of the lead-free double perovskites Cs2BiAgCl6, Cs2BiAgBr6, Cs2SbAgCl6, and Cs2InAgCl6 with different surface termination effects (Fig. 8c).255 The results prove that Cs2BiAgCl6 and Cs2BiAgBr6 with suitable CBM and VBM levels are always suitable for hydrogen evolution, while Cs2SbAgCl6 and Cs2InAgCl6 should be controlled using specific terminations if they are to be applied to water splitting.139 It is found that the stability of each surface is extremely sensitive to the preparation conditions. However, only Cs2BiAgBr6, regardless of the preparation conditions, is favorable for CsBr termination.139 In addition, the band structures of Cs2BiAgCl6 and Cs2BiAgBr6 align well with the redox potential for the HER (Fig. 8d).255 There is no doubt that lead-free perovskites will become next-generation materials, and subsequent research will focus on defect engineering, heterostructure formation, etc. Therefore, this will provide additional platforms for this field and lead to the exploration of new and stable materials in the future.139
5. Conclusions and prospects
Although MHP semiconductors have interesting photophysical properties, the inherently poor stabilities of their soft ionic crystal structures limit their use in photocatalytic reactions and solar-to-chemical-energy processes. However, via changing the external reaction conditions and the inherent stabilities of the metal halide perovskites, they have been successfully and widely used in various photocatalytic reactions. In this review, we introduced the latest developments relating to the use of perovskites in photocatalytic water splitting, CO2 reduction, and organic conversion. Rigorous analysis was conducted focusing on the potential problems that hinder progress in this new scientific research field, such as the toxicity of Pb and material instability issues. However, there are still great difficulties when it comes to applying metal halide perovskites under more common conditions and in more common environments to realize photocatalytic reactions. Based on the current level of knowledge and the limitations of MHP materials, several promising ways to improve the stabilities and efficiencies of MHP-based photocatalysis can be identified.
5.1. Screening more suitable MHP structures via theory and experiment

Via incorporating bulky organic materials (such as phenethylamine or butylamine) to reduce 3D MHPs to quasi-2D and 2D MHPs, the stabilities of MHPs can be improved. In addition, according to guidance from the Goldschmidt tolerance factor, various metal catalysts (such as Bi, Mn, Au, Ag, Co, and Fe) can be incorporated into MHP materials to form stable perovskite structures. In short, 2D MHP materials, dual perovskites, etc. have better intrinsic stabilities and are more suitable for use in photocatalytic systems. However, there is little research on this at present, and existing understanding is not sufficient. At the same time, in order to eliminate the burden of MHP materials on the environment, various transition metals (such as Sn, Sb, and Bi) can be used to replace Pb. However, the stabilities of lead-free HPs are much lower than those of Pb-based MHPs. Therefore, it is necessary to develop lead-free catalysts in combination with other strategies to improve stability.
5.2. Combining MHPs with more suitable electron- and hole-extracting and transporting materials
In order to effectively separate charge carriers, great progress has been made in combining MHPs with GO, rGO, MOFs, and other electron or hole extraction and transport materials for photocatalysis. However, a lot of research is still needed to explore excellent transport materials that better match MHPs, to improve the photocatalytic performances of these systems. For example, it is possible to design ultra-thin heterojunction interfaces between MHPs and other two-dimensional nanomaterials (for example, graphene, phosphorene, MXene, MBene, antimony, etc.) to achieve reliable charge transfer. The relatively narrow band-gaps of MHPs, especially the poor oxidation abilities, are associated with the VB edges. Some oxidation reactions, such as water oxidation (H2O/O2 at 1.23 eV vs. RHE) or organic compound mineralization (OH−/˙OH at 1.67 eV vs. RHE), are most likely to be limited by the oxidation capacity of the MHP. By combining MHPs with other semiconductors with more positive VBs to establish heterostructures (generating a Z-scheme), broad light absorption, effective charge separation, and strong redox capabilities can be achieved.
5.3. Improving the catalytic abilities of MHP-based photocatalyst systems
Regarding the morphology of the MHP material itself, it is possible to synthesize nanostructures with more exposed surfaces (e.g., nanosheets) to increase the surface area and density of the reaction area. Single atom catalysis (SAC) combines the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. Its combination with a MHP photocatalyst will improve the catalytic activity and stability; this is attributed to the rapid increase of surface free energy, quantum confinement effects, unsaturated coordination, and interactions between the metal with reduced size and the substrate. Other promoters (Pt, Au, Ag, CoOx, MoS2, etc.) can also be added to promote the reaction kinetics and speed up the surface reaction rate.
5.4. Exploring excellent sealing technology to ensure the stability of MHP nanocrystals
The sealing material needs to be as transparent as possible so that the MHP shows sufficient light absorption. Secondly, the sealing material should have good conductivity and not affect the extraction of photo-generated carriers. At present, some researchers are using transparent resin materials for encapsulation. Most studies use electron-transport materials and hole-transport materials together to encapsulate MHPs and prepare corresponding photoelectrodes for photocatalytic reactions. Alternatively, via developing PV–PEC reaction systems based on MHP solar cells (via encapsulating the perovskite layer in a solar cell structure), the separation of the MHP and polar solvent can be achieved. MHP solar cells can increase the redox capacity of a PEC system via allowing a larger voltage in series, thereby supporting a wider range of reactions.
5.5. Combined with experimental and theoretical research, it is necessary to conduct in-depth research into the basic principles and mechanisms of MHP-based photocatalysis
In most photocatalytic applications of MHPs, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of the photophysical processes, catalytic kinetic processes, and microscopic mechanisms of surface chemical reactions that are involved. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a complete theoretical model to explain the roles of these materials in photocatalytic processes. Theoretical studies can improve the understanding of established MHP activities, and they can provide strategies for developing simpler materials and structures that are more efficient for photocatalytic reactions.
