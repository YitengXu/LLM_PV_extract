    , Accepted 13th March 2022First published on 25th March 2022AbstractThe invention of Y-series non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) has made a breakthrough in high-performance organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the morphology optimization of the active layer is still challenging in NFA-based OSCs due to the similar building units of the donor and acceptor. Herein, we propose an NFA molecular structure by introducing trifluoro alkyl side chains to the pyrrole unit of the fused ring dithienothiophen[3,2-b]-pyrrolobenzothiadiazole (BTP) core for the first time. Three acceptors with different trifluoro alkyl chains are designed and synthesized, named BTP-BF, BTP-OF, and BTP-DF for the molecules with trifluorobutyl, trifluorooctyl, and trifluorodecyl side chains, respectively. The trifluorodecyl side chains of the BTP-DF molecule can regulate the intrinsic properties of the molecule, which has a significant beneficial effect on the surface energy and the intermolecular interaction. A vertical phase distribution is obtained by pairing BTP-DF with a wide bandgap polymer donor (PTQ10), and the device efficiency can reach as high as 15.14%. These results reveal that introducing trifluoro substitution groups to alkyl side chains is an effective strategy to achieve reduced surface energy and optimal vertical phase distribution, thus facilitating the charge separation and collection to obtain high-performance OSCs.
1. Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have a range of unique properties for photovoltaic applications, including light weight, flexibility, low cost, and semitransparency.1–6 During the past few years, NFA-based OSCs have achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over more than 19% due to the emergence of the continuously optimized structure of Y-series molecules.7–14 The high-performance OSCs are highly dependent on the morphology of the active layer, and their nanomorphology is affected by various factors, such as molecular stacking, domain purity, domain size, and vertical phase separation. However, the morphology of the active layer, especially the vertical distribution, is challenging to control when the donor and acceptor are blended. Therefore, the surface energies need to be different for donor and acceptors, and consequently, the bulk phase distribution could be tuned by optimizing the molecular structures.
The molecular structure of the acceptor not only controls the electronic properties of the material but also affects the evolution of the morphology.15 The molecular stacking and phase separation of the blend film can be coordinated by the molecular backbone and side chains.16–19 The side chain plays a virtual influence on the molecular solubility and backbone packing, which would affect the morphology of the OSCs.20,21 The Y-series small molecular acceptor (SMA) has two side-chain sites connected to the BTP core, i.e., thiophene beta position and pyrrole unit, which not only changes the solubility and surface energy but also regulates the intermolecular interaction and the bulk phase distribution. A subtle variation in the pyrrole unit, such as the length and composition of the side-chain, can significantly affect the molecular stacking and solubility.22–25 Ge et al.26 introduced an alkyl phenyl group at the end of the alkyl chain in the Y system, and the intermolecular stacking distance was appropriately reduced. Li et al.27 introduced a highly polarized amphiphilic oligo(ethylene glycol) side chain to reduce the surface tension to achieve a better phase separation size. However, there are still significant problems in the molecular packing and surface energy control of the Y-series molecules through the alkyl chain at the pyrrole unit.
Meanwhile, fluorination is widely used to regulate the backbone to affect the stacking mode of the donors28–30 and acceptors31–33 due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the fluorine atoms and non-covalent molecular interactions between F⋯S, F⋯π, and F⋯H.15 He's group connected the trifluoromethyl group to the end group of the Y-series acceptors and adjusted the stacking method to make an elliptical structure of four molecular layers in the vertical direction.28 However, the considerably dense F atoms of the trifluoromethyl group in the end group resulted in excessive molecular stacking and domain purity. Thus, there are still challenges to using fluorination to regulate the surface energy and obtain the proper stacking in the morphology of the active layer.
As OSCs technology advances, it shows promising applications in various fields, including outdoor applications such as conventional solar power plants, residential rooftop solar systems, public lighting, and indoor applications such as wearable solar technology, transparent solar panel, the internet of things, etc.34,35 The realization of commercial applications requires further improvements in efficiency, lifetime, and costs.36 For instance, by introducing trifluoro side chains into the A–D–A′–D–A type acceptor molecule, its surface energy could be reduced, so that the acceptor in the active layer tends to be enriched in the upper part, which is conducive to balance hole and electron transport and improve the efficiency. On the other hand, the enriched F atoms in the upper layer could isolate chemical corrosion, which may improve the stability of the device.37–39
Herein, we propose a rational molecular design strategy of trifluoro substitution on the side chain to adjust the surface energy and phase distribution of the electron acceptor. Three NFAs named BTP-BF, BTP-OF, and BTP-DF were designed and synthesized (Fig. 1a), with 4-1,1,1-trifluorobutyl, 8-1,1,1-trifluorooctyl, and 10-1,1,1-trifluorodecyl side-chains linked with the central fused ring BTP unit. The influence of adjusting the side chain on the phase distribution and phase purity in the morphology was systematically investigated. The addition of the trifluoro group significantly affects the compatibility and adjusts the stacking distance and the phase purity. Meanwhile, the surface energy of the acceptor is reduced due to the interaction of the F atom, which favors the enrichment of the acceptor in the upper half part of the active layer and helps form a vertical phase distribution. Consequently, the blend film of PTQ10:BTP-DF exhibits a small π–π stacking distance of 3.56 Å and a large crystal coherence length (CCL, 33.94 Å) when pairing with a wide-bandgap, fluorine atom-rich, and well-matched energy level donor polymer PTQ10, thereby increasing the crystallinity and domain purity and promoting charge transfer. The OSCs based on the blends of PTQ10 and BTP-DF show a similar FF but higher Voc and Jsc compared with BTP-BF and BTP-OF-based devices. Therefore, the BTP-DF-based devices show the highest PCE of 15.14%.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and properties
The synthesis route for BTP-BF, BTP-OF, and BTP-DF is shown in Scheme S1 (ESI†) with similar procedures. BTP-NH was transformed through an N-alkylation reaction in ultra-dry N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). BTP-N-BF, BTP-N-OF, and BTP-N-DF with the fresh Vilsmeier reagent (POCl3 and DMF) produced BTP-BF-CHO, BTP-OF-CHO, and BTP-DF-CHO, respectively.23 The target molecule was synthesized via Knoevenagel reaction between the end group and BTP-BF-CHO, BTP-OF-CHO, and BTP-DF-CHO. These compounds were described by the 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectra and the high-resolution mass spectrum (MALDI-TOF) in Fig. S8–S22.†
The density functional theory calculations were conducted to assess the electron atmosphere and molecular configuration of these three NFAs and Y6, where the undecyl chains were predigested to the methyl group to weaken the intricacy, and the trifluoro alkyl chains were kept. The theoretical calculations demonstrated that those molecules revealed favorable complanation between the central cores and the end groups with dihedral angles of 0.50°, 1.30°, 0.21°, and 3.32° for BTP-BF, BTP-OF, BTP-DF, and Y6, respectively (Fig. S1†). Its planar structure favors intramolecular charge transfer and intermolecular π–π stacking. The longer alkyl straight-chain made the dihedral angle of the BTP-DF molecular skeleton smaller than the branched Y6, and the trifluoro group did not affect the planarity of the molecular skeleton, which is conducive to intramolecular and intermolecular charge transfer.
The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorptions of BTP-BF, BTP-OF, and BTP-DF were detected in the chloroform and film (Fig. 1b). In the solution, the shapes of the absorption peaks of the three materials were almost the same because they had the same skeleton. In comparison with their solution absorption, the absorption of the films was red-shifted around 80 nm, and the absorption range was extended between 600 nm and 900 nm. The significant red-shifted absorption of the film implied strong π–π stacking in the solid. Similar consequences had been shown in previous work on NFA analogs involving alkyl-substitutions.40,41 The optical band gaps of BTP-BF, BTP-OF, and BTP-DF were measured from the absorption edge of the thin films, which were 1.39, 1.31, and 1.33 eV, respectively.
The electrochemical energy levels of the three acceptors were experimented by cyclic voltammetry, as shown in Fig. S2† and Table 1, in 0.1 mol L−1 Bu4NPF6 acetonitrile solutions with Ag/Ag+ as a reference electrode, and formula EHOMO/LUMO = −e(Eox/red − E1/2(Fe/Fe+) + 4.8) (eV) was used in the calculation.42,43 The results presented in Fig. 1c showed that three NFAs kept similar LUMO and HOMO energy levels, indicating that the side chains were less influential. However, BTP-DF with a long alkyl chain had a wider energy bandgap and a lower HOMO than the other two molecules. The electrochemical bandgaps of these materials were matched well with PTQ10. When these molecules were applied as the acceptors for devices, the slight difference of the Voc parameter was due to the variation in the carbon number of the alkyl chain. Besides enhancing the solubility, extending the alkyl trifluoro side chain from four to ten carbons lengths showed the following advantages: broadened infrared absorption spectrum, lower HOMO energy level, and proper steric hindrance in stacking space.

2.2. Photovoltaic performance
To evaluate the influence of trifluoro side chain on the photovoltaic performance of three acceptors based on PTQ10 as a donor, the OSC devices with the structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/PDINN/Ag and the detailed device parameters are presented in Tables S1–S4.† For comparison, the inverted devices are also prepared and the data is summerized in Table S5.† The analysis of related results will be covered in Section 2.4. The BTP-DF-based devices displayed the best PCE of 15.14% with the highest Jsc of 26.47 mA cm−2 and the highest FF of 68.91%. The BTP-BF and BTP-OF-based devices exhibited PCEs of 4.52% and 12.96% with Jsc of 12.15 and 24.37 mA cm−2 and FF of 49.60% and 64.08%, respectively. The increase in the PCE was mainly because of the substantial growth in Jsc and FF in the BTP-DF acceptor, which indicated that extending the length of the side chain at the pyrrole unit increased the solubility, and the trifluoro-alkyl chain can well regulate the accumulation between molecules.
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 2a, and the corresponding parameters are illustrated in Table 2. A comparable upward trend was shown in the photovoltaic performance from the BTP-BF to BTP-DF devices, similar to other previous reports involving alkyl chain tail substitution. The other previous reports involved aryl-substituted analog SMAs. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are shown in Fig. 2b, and the BTP-OF and BTP-DF devices introduced a strong photoresponse from 450 nm to 850 nm with an EQE of over 60%. The integrated current Jcal of the BTP-BF, BTP-OF, and BTP-DF devices were computed as 11.73, 23.58, and 25.28 mA cm−2, which are consistent with the J–V test results. The PCE of PTQ10:BTP-DF was close to PTQ10:Y6 (15.22%) with Voc of 0.85 V, Jsc of 24.48 mA cm−2 and FF of 73.15%. The proper length of the linear n-alkyl on BTP ensured good solubility and proper molecular accumulation. The introduction of trifluoro substituents at the n-alkyl terminal also increased the compatibility and changed the distribution of acceptors, which was reflected in the increase of Jsc of the device. Therefore, the trifluoro substitution regulation strategy is a virtual approach to obtain high photovoltaic performance.

To comprehend the charge generation and dissociation mechanism in the blend films, the correlation between the photocurrent density (Jph) and effective voltage (Veff) is plotted in Fig. 2c. The exciton dissociation efficiencies (ηdiss) were related to the rate of Jsc/Jsat under short-circuit conditions, and they were measured to be 91.0%, 92.2%, 96.9%, and 96.8% for the OSCs based on BTP-BF, BTP-OF, BTP-DF, and Y6, respectively. Meanwhile, the charge collection efficiency (ηcoll) was calculated by the rate of Jmax power/Jsat under the maximal power output point. The BTP-DF (95.4%) and BTP-OF (90.4%) devices provided ηcoll than that of BTP-BF (88.5%). The ηdiss and ηcoll of BTP-DF with a growing carbon chain showed better charge dissociation and collection, which explains the simultaneous increase of Jsc and FF in the OSCs.
The Jsc and Voc under different light intensities were estimated to assess the extent of bimolecular recombination. The degree of recombination can be estimated by Jsc ∝ Plightα equation, where the power factor α represents the degree of recombination. If all the carriers are transferred before the recombination, then the α should be equal to one. As shown in Fig. 2d, the α values for the PTQ10:BTP-DF and PTQ10:Y6 device were 0.99, which was larger than those of PTQ10:BTP-BF (0.97) and PTQ10:BTP-OF (0.98), reflecting the weak loss of the bimolecular recombination under short-circuit conditions. We assumed that the reduced charge recombination losses benefit from the enrichment of acceptors in the upper half part of the active layers, resulting in an exciton upward shift and enriching the excitons at the cathode, which is conducive to the efficient transport of excitons. Meanwhile, to understand the trap-assisted recombination, the ideal factors (n) fitted from the function of Voc ∝ nkTlog(Plight) (where κ is Boltzmann constant, T is temperature, and q is the elementary charge) were 1.69 for BTP-BF, 1.56 for BTP-OF, 1.19 for BTP-DF and 1.23 for Y6 (Fig. 2e), illustrating that the device based on BTP-DF can effectively inhibit the trap-assisted recombination. This result showed that the alkyl side chain from four to ten carbons lengths could efficiently improve the charge generation efficiency and inhibit the trap-assisted charge recombination. Finally, higher Jsc and FF were obtained.
To obtain a better understanding of the charge transport behavior of OSCs, the space charge limited current method was utilized to identify hole and electron mobilities. As shown in Fig. 2f and Table S4,† the μh and μe from BTP-BF to BTP-DF demonstrated the same trend as the FF parameters in these devices. The μh values of the BTP-BF, BTP-OF, and BTP-DF blend films were 5.43 × 10−4, 5.20 × 10−4, and 5.80 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1, the μe values were 1.37 × 10−4, 1.75 × 10−4, and 2.11 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1, and the μh/μe was 3.96, 2.97, and 2.75, respectively. The μh/μe of BTP-DF resulted in the most competitive Jsc, FF, and PCEs. Meanwhile, the electron mobility of BTP-DF was higher than Y6, probably because the F atoms of trifluoro substitution reduced the surface energy, and the acceptors were enriched at the upper part of the film. Two factors affected the charge transport, namely, the molecular packing and transportation pathways.44 Therefore, the proper molecular design can adjust the charge transport by adding the trifluoro group at the end of n-alkyl to change the surface energy.
At the same time, we tested the stability of three materials according to ISOS-L-1 protocols.45 Fig. S7† depicts the performance decay curves of devices in the glove box. For BTP-BF, the performance loss is mainly due to the loss of Jsc, and the PCE decreases very little, and T80 does not appear under continuous illumination for 300 h, indicating that its stability is good. The performance loss of BTP-OF is reflected in Voc, Jsc and FF, and the final PCE decreases rapidly. T80 appears in continuous illumination for 3 h, and PCE remains 62% after continuous illumination for 300 h. The performance loss of BTP-DF is mainly due to Voc loss, but Jsc has a rising trend during the test period, which is speculated to be caused by the vertical phase distribution of the active layer. The stability of the PCE value shows an excellent stable trend. As the literature reported, the PCE stability trend of PTQ10:Y6 is decreasing, and the PCE drops to 82% at 300 h of continuous illumination.46 These results show that the stability of the trifluoro-containing molecules is generally better.
2.3. Surface energy
The miscibility of donor PTQ10 and acceptors was studied by measuring the contact angle to further investigate the difference between different morphologies.47,48 The results are presented in Fig. S3† and Table 3. The Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (χ) explored the miscibility of the donor and acceptor. The larger the χ value, the more obvious the phase separation trend, and the lower the mixing miscibility.49,50 The thermodynamic position of the acceptor was evaluated based on the measured contact angle of water and diiodomethane and its surface energy.51 The surface energy (γ) of the acceptor with trifluoro groups (γBTP-BF = 40.89 mJ m−2, γBTP-OF = 40.74 mJ m−2, γBTP-DF = 38.95 mJ m−2) was lower than Y6 (γ = 41.76 mJ m−2). Meanwhile, the BTP-DF-based mixture had the lowest χ value of 0.12 K (BTP-BF is 0.25 K, and BTP-OF is 0.24 K), resulting in a positive compatibility with PTQ10 and the subsequent favorable morphology. These results indicated that the trifluoro group reduced the surface tension of the acceptor material. When the difference between the surface tension of the donor and the acceptor was small, the acceptor might be concentrated on the upper part of the active layer, which could achieve a short charge transfer. Meanwhile, the surface energy of the acceptor gradually decreased from BTP-BF to BTP-DF, which was due to the adjustment of the proper length of the n-alkyl chain. Therefore, adding the trifluoro group to the tail of the n-alkyl chain and simultaneously regulating the length of the alkyl chain are good strategies for adjusting the surface tension and affecting the distribution of donors and acceptors in the active layer.

2.4. Vertical distribution of excitons
The film depth-dependent light absorption spectroscopy technology52,53 was used to study the vertical distribution of acceptor components in the active layer. Fig. 3a–d shows the simulated exciton generation contours. The optical transmission matrix combined with the active layer film depth depended on the absorption spectrum and the optical characteristics of the transmission layer for optical simulation.54 As shown in Fig. 3a, the exciton production region of PTQ10:Y6 was mainly located at the lower part of the active layer, while the exciton generation region was mainly at the upper part of the film for PTQ10:BTP-based film (Fig. 3b–d). Moreover, the exciton formation rate of the PTQ10:BTP-DF film was higher than that of the PTQ10:BTP-BF and PTQ10:BTP-OF films. In Fig. 3e, the exciton production was crowded in the region of 20–60 nm. This notion meant that the distance of the carriers was shortened after the exciton separation in the D/A interface region, which was conducive to the charge transport and decreased the recombination. As shown in Fig. 3f, the component distribution of the film at different depths could be obtained by using the least square method to numerically fit the spectrum. The content of Y6 was located in the lower half of the film. In the PTQ10:BTP-based device, the acceptor component was partially enriched in the upper direction because they had lower surface energy compared with Y6. Meanwhile, referring to the inverted device data, due to the vertical phase distribution in the active layer, the acceptors tend to be distributed on the upper part of the active layer, which is not conducive to the collection of holes and electrons, resulting in a decrease in Jsc and PCE. This gradient distribution not only facilitated the charge transfer of devices but also provided a larger D/A interface area, resulting in more effective exciton dissociation and carrier transport.

2.5. Morphology analysis
The grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWXAS) was performed to grabble the molecular packing orientation of the neat films and blend films. As shown in Fig. 4a–c, exhibited a the (010) π–π stacking peaks of the BTP-BF, BTP-OF, and BTP-DF pristine films were mainly in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, corresponding to the better face-on stacking orientation. In Fig. 4d–f, the PTQ10:BTP-BF, PTQ10:BTP-OF, and PTQ10:BTP-DF blend films displayed strong diffraction peaks in the OOP direction at q = 1.77 A−1 (d-spacing = 3.58 Å), q = 1.78 A−1 (d-spacing = 3.57 Å), and q = 1.77 A−1 (d-spacing = 3.56 Å), respectively. In the in-plane (IP) orientation, the PTQ10:BTP-BF, PTQ10:BTP-OF, and PTQ10:BTP-DF blend films exhibited strong (100) peaks at 0.26 A−1, 0.27 A−1, and 0.28 A−1, respectively. The PTQ10:BTP-DF blend film showed a stronger peak, corresponding to a lamellar d-spacing of 33.94 Å. This result suggested that the PTQ10:BTP-BF, PTQ10:BTP-OF, and PTQ10:BTP-DF blend films preferred a face-on stacking orientation, which was beneficial to the charge transport in the active layer. According to the Scherrer equation,55,56 the CCL results of the PTQ10:BTP-BF, PTQ10:BTP-OF, and PTQ10:BTP-DF blend films were calculated to be 24.02, 31.92, and 33.94 Å, respectively. The results are listed in Table S6.† The face-on molecular stacking facilitated the charge transport and extraction.15 With the increase in coherence length, more favorable face-on orientations and less π–π packing and lamellar packing were favorable for charge transport and Jsc, which were consistent with the results of J–V curve.

Apart from the GIWAXS, the atom force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) methods were also applied to study the morphology of the three blend films with the addition of trifluoro-substituted group. As shown in Fig. 5a–f, the surfaces of the three blends were uniform, and no agglomeration was formed. Moreover, compared with the root mean square (RMS) of the surface roughness in the BTP-BF blend (RMS = 1.20 nm), the BTP-DF blend exhibited a smoother surface (RMS = 1.07 nm), further corroborating the better miscibility of BTP-DF and PTQ10. The TEM images of the three films exhibited similarity, but the domain size of the BTP-BF blend was smaller.

Therefore, the PTQ10:BTP-DF blend film had good miscibility and orderly packing, contributing to its high Jsc and FF. This result showed the importance of tuning the surface energy and miscibility in obtaining the optimized morphology in OSCs.
3. Conclusion
In summary, we have synthesized three small molecule acceptor materials and attached trifluoro groups to the end of the alkyl chain of the pyrrole unit. This change did not affect the molecular skeleton, but it altered the surface energy of the molecule and the compatibility with the donor molecule, thereby influencing the molecular stacking. This substitution regulates the phase separation in the bulk phase and forms a favorable carrier pathway for the phase distribution in the vertical direction. Therefore, this work provides a facile method for the phase adjustment in the non-fullerene systems and further design of high-performance acceptor molecular materials.
