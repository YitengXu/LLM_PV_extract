    , Accepted 14th March 2021First published on 15th March 2021AbstractGel electrolytes are promising candidates for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and other devices, but the ways to obtain stable gels always result in sacrifice of their ionic conductivity. This contradiction seriously limits the practical application of gel electrolytes. Herein, a new design strategy using rich carboxylic group-modified silica nanoparticles (COOH-SiO2) with a branched, well-organized framework to develop ionic liquid-based gel electrolytes possessing high conductivity is demonstrated. The branched network of COOH-SiO2 and the strong interaction in electrolytes result in the effective solidification of ionic liquids. Moreover, adding COOH-SiO2 to ionic liquid electrolytes contributes to salt dissociation, decreases the activation energy, and improves the charge transport and recombination characteristics at the electrolyte/electrode interface. DSSCs fabricated with COOH-SiO2 nanoparticles deliver a higher short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) than the reference cell. A maximum efficiency of 8.02% with the highest Jsc value of 16.60 mA cm−2 is obtained for solar cells containing 6 wt% COOH-SiO2.
1. Introduction
Among different photovoltaic devices, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) offer much promise in the next-generation sustainable energy market due to their simple fabrication process, scalable components, low cost and satisfactory efficiency.1–6 The typical architecture of DSSCs is composed of a dye-coated TiO2 photoanode, a catalytic counter electrode and an electrolyte including a redox couple, usually I−/I3−, where the electrolyte acts as a medium to transport the electrons and ionic species.7–9 Although conventional liquid electrolytes have endowed DSSCs with a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 14%, they still suffer from severe leakage and evaporation problems.10 To address the issues, researchers have proposed gel electrolytes since they have rapid ionic diffusion like liquid electrolytes and outstanding mechanical properties like solids.11–14 It has been reported that introducing polymers,15–18 small organic molecules19–21 or inorganic nanoparticles22–25 as gelators could seal liquid electrolytes.
Recently, ionic liquid electrolytes have attracted tremendous attention as electrolytes in energy conversion and storage systems due to their excellent features including low vapor pressure, tunable viscosity, broad electrochemical potential window and good stability.26–29 However, the relatively low ion mobility and high viscosity of pure ionic liquids limit the transportation of ions, leading to unsatisfactory ionic conductivity and diffusion coefficient.30 Introducing nanoparticles into ionic liquid electrolytes could not only solidify the liquid electrolytes, but also can accelerate the charge transport, improving the long-term stability of DSSCs and ionic conductivity of electrolytes simultaneously. The nanoparticles used in these systems strongly influence the properties of electrolytes resulting from Lewis acid–base reactions and heterogeneous doping effects.31 Meanwhile, owing to the intermolecular interactions, nanoparticles can form three-dimensional (3D) interconnected frameworks to immobilize the fluid, which is strongly influenced by the surface chemical modification.32–35 It was found that carboxyl group-functionalized silica nanoparticles could increase the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) for DSSCs, while a large quantity of nanoparticles (≥15 wt%) is necessary to obtain the expected gel.36 Such an increase in the amount of inorganic nanoparticles is inevitably not favorable for the ionic conductivity of gel electrolytes and photocurrent of batteries. Therefore, how to reduce the contents of nanoparticles in gel electrolytes as far as possible is critical for the preparation of electrolytes with high conductivity and excellent mechanical properties.
In our previous work, increasing the quantity of functional groups attached on the nanoparticles was found to effectively decrease the used particle amount to solidify the ionic liquid electrolytes.23 Hence, in this study, the rich carboxylic group-modified silica (COOH-SiO2) nanoparticles are synthesized through silanizing SiO2 nanoparticles with pre-polymerized (3-isocyanatopropyl)-triethoxysilane and subsequent acid treatment. The gel electrolytes can be achieved using a very small amount of COOH-SiO2 (2 wt%). More importantly, compared with pure ionic liquid electrolytes, the gel electrolytes containing COOH-SiO2 exhibit an enhancement in ionic conductivity and the diffusion coefficient. In addition, the photovoltaic measurements of the fabricated DSSCs suggest that the incorporation of COOH-SiO2 remarkably improves the collection efficiency of electrons and directly increases the Jsc values of DSSCs. The best photovoltaic performance is achieved using the COOH-SiO2 nanoparticles in a weight ratio of 6 wt% with a Jsc value of 16.60 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 685 mV and a fill factor (FF) of 0.705 corresponding to a PCE of 8.02% under AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2).
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of COOH-SiO2 nanoparticles
A schematic illustration of the process for the modification of silica particles is shown in Scheme 1. Firstly, (3-isocyanatopropyl)-triethoxysilane (CPTS) (6.77 mL, 0.027 mol) was treated with water (360 μL, 0.02 mol) with stirring at room temperature for 24 h. Ca(OH)2 (0.54 mmol, 0.04 g) was then added to the suspension, followed by stirring for 30 min at ambient temperature and 1 h at 80 °C under a vacuum of 300 Pa, respectively. After filtration, pre-polymerized CPTS (p-CPTS) was obtained. Then, p-CPTS (4 mL, 0.016 mol) was dispersed in toluene (100 mL, 0.94 mol) containing fumed SiO2 nanoparticles (33.33 mmol, 2 g, 7 nm), and kept under stirring under a N2 flow for 48 h. After this, the sample was filtered and the powder was washed with dichloromethane three times and dried in a vacuum oven at 85 °C overnight. The achieved sample is hereafter named CN-SiO2. To synthesize COOH-SiO2, CN-SiO2 (9 mmol, 0.96 g) was added into a mixed solution of H2SO4 (30 mL, 0.56 mol) and H2O (30 mL, 1.67 mol), which was then refluxed at 150 °C for 3 h. After washing with water and drying in a vacuum oven at 85 °C overnight, the final product COOH-SiO2 was obtained.

2.2 Preparation of gel electrolytes
The ionic liquid electrolytes, labeled as HA, consist of HMII/AMII//I2/NMBI/GNCS (molar ratio: 8/8/1/1.2/1.2), in which HMII, AMII, NMBI and GNCS are 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, N-methylbenzimidazole and guanidinium thiocyanate, respectively. The gel electrolytes were prepared by grinding a certain amount of particles into the as-prepared ionic liquid electrolytes.
2.3 Fabrication of DSSCs
Photovoltaic experiments were carried out using cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2-bipyridyl-4,4-dicarboxylato)-ruthenium(II), coded N3, as the sensitizer. The TiO2 photoelectrode consisting of transparent and scattering layers has been reported in detail in our previous work.37 After sintering at 450 °C and cooling to approximately 80 °C, the TiO2 photoelectrode was totally soaked in N3 dye solution (0.5 mM in absolute ethanol) for absorption for more than 24 h. After the completion of adsorption, the electrode was taken out and rinsed with absolute ethanol to remove the physically adsorbed dye, and then the dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode (N3-TiO2) was obtained. To assemble a sandwich-like DSSC device, the as-prepared electrolyte was smeared onto the dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode and ensured that it completely penetrated into the porous films. Then a platinum sheet counter electrode was directly covered on the electrolyte without any spacer between the electrodes. Before testing, the as-assembled DSSC was transferred to the special rack and fixed with some screws.
2.4 Instruments
Infrared spectra (IR) were recorded using a TENSOR-27 spectrophotometer (Bruker Co.) and Raman spectra were recorded using a LabRAM HR Evolution spectrometer (HORIBA Co.). Zeta potential of the nanoparticles was measured using a Zetasizer NANO ZS ZEN3600 (Malvern Instruments Ltd). Before testing, the samples were dispersed in deionized water and sonicated for 30 min. The average values of the zeta potential were achieved on account of 6 parallel samples. The interfacial contact properties of the electrolyte and the morphology of particles were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, SU8010) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM 2011), respectively. The chemical state of samples was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), where the binding energies were calibrated using the C 1s photoelectron peak (284.8 eV). In addition, XPS and IR spectra were also recorded on pure TiO2 and a mixture of TiO2 and COOH-SiO2 (the weight ratio is 10:1). The photovoltaic performance of DSSCs was evaluated using a Keithley 2611 source meter under AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2) with a photoactive area of 0.2 cm2. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of DSSCs and ionic conductivity measurement of electrolytes were performed using a Solartron 1255B frequency response analyzer and a SI 1287 electrochemical interface in the frequency range from 0.1 to 106 Hz. The EIS measurements were carried out using a solar simulator with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 and an AC modulation signal of 10 mV. The bias DC potential was 0 V. Besides, the conductivity at different temperatures was linearly fitted with Origin software and the obtained EIS data were fitted using Z-View software based on the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 4d. The Mott–Schottky analysis and cyclic voltammetry (CV) of electrolytes were carried out in a three-electrode system. A Pt wire was used as the counter electrode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode, and N3-TiO2 or Pt wire electrodes as the working electrode, respectively. In the Mott–Schottky measurement, the electrolytes contained 0.05 M I2 and 0.5 M KI in EC/PC electrolytes with different amounts of COOH-SiO2 (0 wt%, 3 wt%, 6 wt%, and 9 wt%). In the CV measurement, the electrolytes were composed of 1 mM I2, 10 mM LiI and 0.1 M LiClO4 in acetonitrile with different amounts of COOH-SiO2 (0 wt%, 1wt%, 3wt%, and 5 wt%). To directly assess the effects of COOH-SiO2 on the electrocatalytic activity of electrolytes towards redox species, Pt wire was pierced into the electrolyte to the same depth of 1.5 cm.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization for nanoparticles
The IR spectra of SiO2, CN-SiO2 and COOH-SiO2 are shown in Fig. 1a. The broad absorption band at around 3500 cm−1 in the spectrum of SiO2 is assigned to absorbed water and Si-OH, forming a certain amount of hydrogen bonds and ensuring the subsequent silane coupling reaction. Compared with pristine SiO2, the adsorption band of CN-SiO2 at 2251 cm−1 is ascribed to the stretching modes of –CN groups, whereas the bands at 2800–3000 cm−1 and 1400–1500 cm−1 are assigned to the stretching modes and bending modes of silane –CH2 groups, respectively. These clearly confirm the anchoring of cyanopropyl groups onto the surface of silica. According to the size of silica nanoparticles (7 nm) and the result of CHN Anal. Calcd (N 2.96, C 11.60, H 2.24), the calculated concentration of –CN groups attached to each silica nanoparticle is 126.9 mmol g−1, confirming the rich amount of functional groups in nanoparticles. After acid treatment, the disappearance of the band at 2251 cm−1 and the appearance of bands at 1709 cm−1 and 1402 cm−1 corresponding to the CO stretching modes and –OH bending modes of carboxylic groups, respectively, indicate that the cyanopropyl groups are entirely hydrolyzed and the surface of silica nanoparticles are successfully capped with carboxylic groups. Meanwhile, the band at around 3500 cm−1 clearly shifts to a lower wavenumber with respect to SiO2, suggesting the strengthening of hydrogen bonds in the COOH-SiO2 nanoparticles.38
 Fig. 1  IR spectra (a) and zeta potential (b) of the as-prepared samples and TEM images of SiO2 (c) and COOH-SiO2 (d). 
The zeta potential of nanoparticles was tested in pure deionized water and shown in Fig. 1b. Pristine silica shows a negative Z-potential of −1.66 ± 0.56 mV attributed to the presence of SiO− species on the surface. After the reaction with p-CPTS, the Z-potential becomes more negative (−7.27 ± 0.98 mV), while the Z-potential of COOH-SiO2 is −26.33 ± 0.85 mV because of the deprotonation of surface polar groups on the surface of silica. Because of the surface negative charge characteristic of COOH-SiO2 nanoparticles, they will absorb lots of cations onto their surfaces, which is beneficial for salt dissociation and ionization of iodide in the electrolytes.39
The morphology of the nanoparticles was characterized by TEM. As shown in Fig. 1c and d, the COOH-SiO2 nanoparticles have a more spherical-like structure and larger size than pristine SiO2. Notably, COOH-SiO2 possesses more branched agglomerates than SiO2. Hence, the framework of nanoparticles with surface modification is neater and more well-organized.33 This better nanoparticle network is attributed to the strong hydrogen bond and van der Waals interaction resulting from the rich carboxyl groups on the surface of COOH-SiO2. Certainly, such a well-organized framework results in efficient ionic transport pathways and is expected to facilitate ion transport. In addition, during the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) test, shown in Fig. S1,† there is a weight loss (∼12.3 wt%) from 170 to 575 °C for COOH-SiO2, which corresponds to the fracture and oxidation of surface modified molecules. This indicates that the nanoparticles show excellent stability at 170 °C, which is enough for practical outdoor applications.
3.2 Performance of electrolytes
It is well known that reducing the fluidity of the electrolytes is one of the main strategies to improve the safety of energy devices.40 As observed in the inset image of Fig. 2a, the liquid becomes immobile when introducing a very small amount of COOH-SiO2 nanoparticles (2 wt%) at room temperature, indicating that they are excellent gelators to solidify ionic liquid electrolytes. Such effective solidification for electrolytes stems from the highly branched framework of COOH-SiO2.
 Fig. 2  (a and b) IR spectra of electrolytes containing different contents of COOH-SiO2 (the inset image in Fig. 2a shows the photograph of the corresponding electrolytes), (c) effects of COOH-SiO2 on the ionic conductivity of electrolytes and diffusion coefficient of I3− ions, and (d) temperature dependence of ionic conductivity of electrolytes with different contents of COOH-SiO2. 
The IR spectra of electrolytes with different contents of COOH-SiO2 (Fig. 2a and b) were recorded to assess the relationship between the surface functional groups of nanoparticles and ionic liquid electrolytes. The two adsorption peaks at 1568 and 1429 cm−1 correspond to the imidazole ring of the pure ionic liquid electrolyte, and they shift to a lower frequency of 1562 and 1421 cm−1 in the IR spectrum of the gel electrolyte with 10 wt% COOH-SiO2. This indicates the formation of hydrogen bonds between the carboxylic groups of COOH-SiO2 nanoparticles and imidazole cations of the ionic liquid, which further confirms the efficient ionization of iodide and gelation of electrolytes.41–43
The ionic transport properties of electrolytes including ionic conductivity and diffusion are investigated since they directly determine the performance of devices. As shown in Fig. 2c, the ionic conductivity (σ) of the pure ionic liquid electrolyte is 1.8 mS cm−1 at room temperature. After adding COOH-SiO2 nanoparticles, the ionic conductivity of electrolytes shows an obvious improvement. The maximum ionic conductivity is found to be 5.4 mS cm−1 for the gel electrolyte with 10 wt% COOH-SiO2. The increased conductivity is ascribed to the formed well-organized framework in the electrolyte, which results in efficient ionic transport pathways and is expected to facilitate ion transport. However, when the content of COOH-SiO2 is beyond 10 wt%, the ionic conductivity tends to decrease due to the aggregation of excess nanoparticles, which will limit ion movement and block charge transport.44 Notably, the ionic conductivity of 2.9 mS cm−1 for the gel electrolyte with 20 wt% COOH-SiO2 is still higher than that of the pure ionic liquid electrolyte. This remarkable increase in the conductivity will improve the performance of DSSCs with COOH-SiO2, especially the Jsc values. Moreover, the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte is also studied in the temperature range of 25–80 °C (Fig. 2d). It can be seen that all the ionic conductivities show the tendency of increase with increasing temperature. The temperature dependence of ionic conductivity is analyzed using the Arrhenius model:45–47  where σ0 is the pre-exponential factor, Ea is the activation energy and kB is the Boltzmann constant. The activation energies of electrolytes with 0 wt% and 5 wt% COOH-SiO2 are calculated to be 0.279 eV and 0.194 eV, respectively. This great decrease in activation energy suggests that the usage of COOH-SiO2 significantly facilitates ionic transport, which is ascribed to sufficient salt dissociation and the effective charge transport pathway.
In addition, the diffusion coefficients of I3− ions (DI3−) are measured by linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 on the symmetrical Pt/electrolyte/Pt cells in the potential range of −0.7–0.7 V (Fig. S2†). The values of DI3− are estimated from the cathodic limiting current density (Jlim) using the equation DI3− = Jliml/(2nFC), in which l is the distance between the two Pt electrodes, n is the number of electrons transferred, I3− + 2e− → 3I−, F is the Faraday constant and C is the bulk concentration of redox species.21,48 As can be seen in Fig. 2c, the main trend of DI3− with the contents of COOH-SiO2 is in good agreement with the ionic conductivity results. Incorporating COOH-SiO2 nanoparticles drastically increases the DI3− of electrolytes. For example, the obtained DI3− is improved to 1.40 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 for gel electrolytes with 6 wt% COOH-SiO2 compared with that of pure ionic liquid electrolytes (4.00 × 10−7 cm2 s−1). This means that the COOH-SiO2 nanoparticles can act not only as gelators to effectively solidify the liquid electrolytes but also as additives to promote the performance of electrolytes. More importantly, we observed that the diffusion coefficients quickly reach the best value at a concentration of 6 wt% and then begin to slowly decrease, whereas the ionic conductivities slowly increase with the addition of COOH-SiO2 and achieve the highest value at a concentration of 10 wt%. This difference could be attributed to the joint effects between the nanoparticle framework and the amount of surface functional groups. A small amount of COOH-SiO2 nanoparticles could form a well-organized framework in the electrolyte, which can significantly increase the diffusion coefficient of I3− species but not enough to tremendously improve the ionic conductivity of gel electrolytes. With the increasing amount of nanoparticles, the ionic conductivity continues to increase but some formed aggregates clearly impede the transport of ions. Finally, the excessive addition of nanoparticles triggers severe accumulation, leading to the obvious decrease in both of them.
3.3 Ionic transport mechanism in the gel electrolytes
To deeply understand the ionic transport mechanism and assess the different electroactivities of redox species in the electrolytes, CV experiments were firstly carried out using a three-electrode system. As mentioned in the Experimental section, since the immersion depth of Pt wire in the electrolytes was the same, the electrocatalytic behaviors of electrolytes towards redox species could be directly assessed. As shown in Fig. 3a, for the pure liquid electrolyte, only one weak pair of redox peaks is observed for the oxidation and reduction of I−/I3−, indicating that the electrocatalytic activity of the pristine electrolyte towards I−/I3− couples is not high. In contrast, due to the addition of COOH-SiO2, another reduction peak ascribed to I2/I3− couples is obviously observed.49 It should be noted that for the electrolyte with a small amount of COOH-SiO2, the anodic peak potential for the oxidation of iodide ions is clearly negatively shifted, indicating that there is an interaction between the nanoparticles and redox couple. This interaction may result from the donor–acceptor mechanism to form a molecular complex, where the iodide ion is the electron donor and the carboxyl group is the electron acceptor, facilitating the oxidation of iodide ions.50,51 Besides, the anodic and cathodic peak current densities of electrolytes are dramatically increased when COOH-SiO2 is added to the system, confirming the important role of COOH-SiO2 in enhancing the electroactivity. The higher peak currents suggest faster reaction rates of I−/I3−, which is attributed to the accelerated diffusion kinetics and recovery of redox species within the nanoparticle network of gel electrolytes.52
 Fig. 3  CV curves (a), UV-vis spectra (b), absorption value ratio of I− and I3− (c), and Raman spectra (d) of electrolytes containing different contents of COOH-SiO2 (the inset image shows the corresponding magnification in the Raman shift range of 160–190 cm−1). 
Additionally, UV-vis adsorption spectra of electrolytes containing different amounts of COOH-SiO2 were recorded and are shown in Fig. 3b to qualitatively describe the impact of nanoparticles on electrolytes.53–56 The absorption peaks of I− appear at approximately 220 nm, while the absorption peaks at around 290 and 370 nm are ascribed to I3−. The absorption value ratio of I− and I3− for electrolytes is shown in Fig. 3c, which shows a trend of first increasing and then decreasing with increasing contents of COOH-SiO2. This can be attributed to the Lewis acid–base reactions between the redox species and carboxyl groups on the surface of nanoparticles. As a consequence, the effective concentration of I− in the electrolytes is increased firstly and then reduced, which is closely related to the electron recombination of devices.
The Raman spectra of electrolytes (Fig. 3d) were also recorded to investigate the variation of redox species in the electrolytes. The two bands at 110 cm−1 and 145 cm−1 for the pure ionic liquid electrolyte are ascribed to the symmetric and asymmetric vibrations of I3− ions, respectively. When 10 wt% COOH-SiO2 was added, we observe that there is another band at 175 cm−1 attributed to the vibration of I5−, suggesting the formation of I5− in the gel electrolytes.57 It has been reported that the charge transport in the low-fluidity iodide electrolytes is mainly derived from the Grotthus relay-type mechanism, which is significantly influenced by the distance between donor and acceptor centers and the concentration of iodine and iodide.58–60 Therefore, the presence of polyiodide chains increases the number of charge carriers, providing better charge transport in the gel electrolytes.
Consequently, the ionic transport mechanism for gel electrolytes is comprehensively described in Scheme 2. Firstly, owing to the strong intermolecular interaction between adjacent COOH-SiO2 nanoparticles, they exhibit a better and well-ordered network structure in the electrolytes, providing an effective charge transport pathway for the directional transmission of I3− and decreasing the activation energy. Secondly, the surface negative charge properties of COOH-SiO2 as well as the hydrogen bonds between the carboxylic groups and imidazole cations cause the larger size disparity of cations, which are favorable for the ionization of I− and diffusion coefficient of ions, improving the electrocatalytic activity towards I−/I3− redox couples. Furthermore, the increased concentration of iodide and the presence of polyiodide immediately enhance the amount of charge carriers, significantly improving the ionic conductivity of electrolytes.

3.4 Performance of DSSCs
The penetration of gel electrolytes is firstly evaluated in the mesoporous TiO2 photoanode. Fig. S3† shows the variation of cross-sectional SEM images before and after deposition with gel electrolytes with 6 wt% COOH-SiO2. The bare TiO2 photoanode consists of a 3.5 μm-thick nanocrystalline TiO2 layer and a 4 μm-thick scattering layer with the pore size of 250 nm. After direct contact with gel electrolytes, the nanopores vanish and the film is well-covered with electrolytes, suggesting that the gel electrolytes have good penetration in the TiO2 photoanode.
The photocurrent density-applied potential (J–V) characteristics of the DSSCs with different amounts of COOH-SiO2 are shown in Fig. 4a. The detailed photovoltaic parameters including Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE of these cells are listed in Table 1. In the pure ionic liquid system, the average PCE is 5.97% corresponding to a Jsc value of 12.03 mA cm−2, Voc of 697 mV and FF of 0.713 under AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2). The introduction of COOH-SiO2 in the electrolyte results in a significant increase of Jsc. As a result, for the gel electrolytes containing 6 wt% COOH-SiO2, the best photovoltaic performance is achieved with a Jsc value of 16.47 mA cm−2, Voc of 680 mV and FF of 0.700, resulting in the average PCE of 7.84%. This remarkable improvement in the Jsc values is mainly derived from the facilitated ionic transport and increased ionic conductivity.

To explain the variation of Voc, Mott–Schottky measurements of the N3-TiO2 photoanode were performed in different electrolytes. As shown in Fig. 4b, the addition of COOH-SiO2 positively shifts the TiO2 conduction band edge, leading to a lower Voc than that of the pure ionic liquid electrolyte. Meanwhile, XPS and IR spectra were recorded on TiO2 and a mixture of TiO2 and COOH-SiO2 (TiO2 & COOH-SiO2) to analyze the relation between them. The survey spectrum of TiO2 and TiO2 & COOH-SiO2 are shown in Fig. S4 and S5,† respectively. From the Ti 2p spectra shown in Fig. 4c, we observe that the Ti 2p peaks of TiO2 are shifted toward the higher binding energy direction for TiO2 & COOH-SiO2. Moreover, as shown in Fig. S6,† the Ti–O stretching modes (701 and 517 cm−1) in the IR spectrum of TiO2 shift to a higher frequency (679 and 472 cm−1) in the spectrum of TiO2 & COOH-SiO2. Also, when compared with the IR spectra of COOH-SiO2 (Fig. 1a), the CO stretching modes (1709 cm−1) shift to a lower frequency (1752 cm−1) in the spectrum of TiO2 & COOH-SiO2, suggesting the intermolecular interaction between TiO2 and the carboxyl groups of COOH-SiO2 nanoparticles. These results confirm the interaction between TiO2 and COOH-SiO2, thus leading to the positive shift of the TiO2 conduction band edge. Furthermore, the dark currents of DSSCs (Fig. S7†) obviously increase with increasing contents of COOH-SiO2, suggesting an improvement in the recombination rate and immediately resulting in a lower Voc and FF of solar cells.
The electron transport and recombination kinetics of DSSCs were systematically investigated using EIS techniques. Fig. 4d shows the Nyquist plots of DSSCs with different amounts of COOH-SiO2 fitted using the Bisquert model and the inset is the used equivalent circuit.61–64CFT, CFTO, and CPt and RFT, RFTO, and RPt are associated with the capacitance and the corresponding resistance at the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/TiO2, electrolyte/FTO and electrolyte/Pt interfaces, respectively, where Rs stands for the series resistance, Rw and Rk are the charge transfer and recombination resistance of electrons in the electrolyte/TiO2 interfaces, Cμ is the corresponding double-layer capacitance and Zw represents the resistance of the electrolyte. The fitting results and some related electrochemical parameters calculated using the following equations are summarized in Table 2:          where τe, τd and ηCOL are the effective lifetime, transport time and collection efficiency of electrons, respectively, fmax represents the maximum frequency of charge transfer, keff stands for the recombination rate, Deff signifies the effective diffusion coefficient and L is the thickness of the TiO2 photoanode.

In general, the performance of DSSCs could probably be enhanced through reducing the value of Rs. It can be observed that Rs values of DSSCs based on gel electrolytes are all lower than that of DSSC based on the pristine ionic liquid electrolyte, and DSSC with 4 wt% COOH-SiO2 nanoparticles has the minimum Rs value. These could be attributed to the better performance of gel electrolytes and the superior interfacial charge transport between electrolytes and photoanode/counter electrodes because all other components except the electrolytes remain unchanged for all devices.65,66 Besides, the calculated Rk/Rw values of gel electrolytes obviously show enhancement. For instance, the gel electrolyte with 4 wt% and 6 wt% COOH-SiO2 shows the Rk/Rw values of 12.9 and 12.0, respectively, which are approximately 4 times that of the pure ionic liquid electrolyte (3.2). This result is consistent with the tendency of calculated electron transfer times (τd) in the TiO2 films, in which that of gel electrolytes with 4 wt% and 6 wt% COOH-SiO2 decrease to 0.6 ms and 0.7 ms, respectively, demonstrating that the charge transfer of electrons plays a dominated role in the DSSCs with COOH-SiO2. In addition, the effective diffusion coefficient (Deff) of electrolytes and electron lifetimes (τe) of DSSCs both increase with the introduction of COOH-SiO2. As a consequence, the electron collection efficiencies (ηCOL) of DSSCs with gel electrolytes are higher than that of cells based on pure ionic liquid electrolytes. This significant improvement of ηCOL directly leads to the increase of Jsc for DSSCs with COOH-SiO2.
The long-term stability of DSSCs based on electrolytes containing different amounts of COOH-SiO2 was investigated under continuous illumination without sealing and the photovoltaic performance was measured periodically. The normalized PCE of DSSCs as a function of illumination time is shown in Fig. S8a.† After testing for about 300 h, all cells based on gel electrolytes exhibit higher stability than those based on the pure ionic liquid electrolyte (67% retention), demonstrating that the fabricated gel electrolytes make the device exhibit extraordinary durability. In particular, the efficiency of the DSSC with 20 wt% COOH-SiO2 has basically been increased during the test, which may be attributed to the increased Jsc and Voc values shown in Fig. S8b.† This increase could be due to the heating of the cell by the lamp, which is favorable for the interfacial contact between gel electrolytes and electrodes. In contrast, DSSCs with 4 wt% and 6 wt% COOH-SiO2 exhibited slightly fluctuated efficiencies. As can be seen in Fig. S8b,†Jsc increased slightly at the beginning of the test and then decreased. After 150 hours, Jsc began to rise again, which may be due to the decrease in the viscosity of the electrolyte caused by water absorption.
4. Conclusion
Rich carboxylic group-modified silica nanoparticles with a branched and well-organized framework were synthesized to develop ionic liquid-based gel electrolytes possessing high ionic conductivities. The well-organized nanoparticle network, surface negative charge properties of nanoparticles, strong intermolecular interaction between carboxyl groups and imidazole rings as well as the Lewis acid–base reactions between nanoparticles and electrolytes effectively facilitated the charge transport and increased the amount of charge carriers, resulting in the improvement of the ionic conductivity of gel electrolytes and diffusion of I3− ions. Consequently, these modified nanoparticles dramatically increased the Jsc value of DSSCs by 36.9% in comparison with that of pure ionic liquid electrolyte-based DSSCs due to the increase of electron collection efficiency, leading to an optimal average efficiency of 7.84% under AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2).
