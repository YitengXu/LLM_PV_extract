These carbon fibers show superior capacity retention and rate performance as anode in lithium ion batteries.
Population and economic growth are leading to a massive increase in global energy consumption. This fact, coupled with limited fossil resources and serious environmental concerns, means that alternative energy strategies are necessary. Renewable, sustainable energy harvesting often relies on non-continuous power sources such as solar, wind, hydro or geothermal. The successful implementation of such technologies is therefore strongly related to the development of more efficient energy storage systems.
As of today, the best choice for energy storage appears to be lithium-based technologies. For portable devices, such as computing, telecommunication equipment together with potentially large scale systems in electrical vehicle, lithium ion batteries (LIBs) are key components due to their high energy density and power density.1 Sustainable and low cost electrode materials are the perfect solution to build the next-generation of high performance LIBs. In this respect, carbon materials derived from low cost renewable resources using low energy consumption processes will play a very important role in the future.
The global rice production is about 600 million tones per year and generates more than 100 million tons of rice husks, as the rice husks makes up about 20% of the rice (paddy) weight.2–4 The main components of rice husk are cellulose (38%), hemicelluloses (18%), lignin (22%), and SiO2. However, chemical composition varies from the paddy species and growing conditions.5
One promising potential of lignocellulosic biomass utilization is the generation of biofuels as a sustainable alternative for transportation without CO2 emissions. This can be achieved either by fermentation,6 gasification7 or catalytic liquefaction.8 Another alternative is to provide renewable starting materials for the production of chemicals, vitamins, pharmaceuticals, colorants, polymers, and surfactants.9 Industrial white biotechnology highlights the use of micro-organisms to provide the chemicals from biomass.10 Transformation of biomass into sustainable carbon materials is less encountered, however a topic of growing interest.
Various biomass-derived carbons (e.g. cherry stone, olive stone, mangrove charcoal, rice husk, peanut shell, cotton wool) have been investigated for high capacities and good capacity retentions as anode for LIBs.11–17 Among these publications Prof. Fey's group reported on the use of rice husk as a precursor for the preparation of pyrolytic carbons in the presence of strong acids or bases and its use as a negative electrode in Li ion batteries. The highest insertion and deinsertion capacities were observed with the carbon obtained from rice husk treated with 0.3 M NaOH (819 and 463 mA h g−1, respectively).17 In order to obtain a high surface area necessary for such applications, chemical activation is normally applied.18–20 However, chemical activation generates microporous materials only, has poor control over the pore size distribution and produces irregular-shape carbons with low yields. An additional problem is the corrosion of the reaction devices due to the rather harsh activation agents.
Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is an alternative carbonization technique for biomass using milder temperatures (180–250 °C) and subcritical water as a carbonization media. It presents multiple advantages:21–23 (1) the porosity and morphology of the resulting carbons can be easily controlled by nanocasting.24 (2) The resulting carbons have many functional groups on the surface which can be used in many applications.25 (3) The surface chemistry and the electronic property can be easily controlled by additional thermal treatment without changing the morphology.26 (4) The yield is about 70–80% which is higher than pyrolysis or chemical activation. (5) The process takes place in water therefore the biomass precursors do not need to be dried, avoiding additional costs.
Normally, acid hydrolysis and steam explosion can be used to hydrolyse hemicelluloses,27,28 while alkaline treatment can effectively depolymerize lignin.29,30 Organosolv methods are also recognized as alternatives to traditional pulping techniques. Thus, Zhang et al. stated that concentrated formic acid (i.e. 88 wt%) can degrade 85% of hemicelluloses and 70% of lignin at 60 °C for 6 hours.31 Various other reports showed similar results: high concentrations (above 70%) of formic acid can depolymerize 50–95% of hemicelluloses and 70–95% of lignin at 60–130 °C within 8 h32–38 while the cellulose component remains intact.
Subsequent to the removal of lignin and hemicellulose fractions using the previously described formic acid method, we will use the cellulose component of rice husk as a precursor for hydrothermal carbonization. In addition, the SiO2 component will be used as an “in situ” hard template to introduce porosity into the resulting carbon materials. After further calcination and SiO2 removal, the electrochemical properties of such rice husk-derived fibrous porous carbon materials will be investigated as anode in LIBs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the production of porous carbon materials from rice-husk without chemical activation for Li ion batteries applications. We have instead used the silica fraction as an “in situ” sacrificial template.

Scheme 1 illustrates the concept of our synthetic procedure. Three steps were required to prepare the hierarchical fibrous carbons. In the first step, we used formic acid (also a potential biomass derivate) to remove hemicellulose and lignin.31 After formic acid treatment, the majority of the lignin and hemicelluloses are liquefied39 leaving behind an interdigitated fibrous cellulose network. On the other hand, the hemicellulose and lignin are depolymerized into mono- or oligosaccharides (e.g. xylose)40 and phenols,41 which can be potentially recycled into valuable chemicals. However, the focus here is to convert the remaining cellulose into hydrothermal carbon materials followed by further calcination to increase the electronic conductivity and removal of the inorganic fraction to free up porosity, necessary for a better mass transportation in LIBs electrodes.
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of the synthetic strategy for the production of fibrous porous carbon from rice husk. 
The morphologies of rice husk following different treatments are shown in Fig. 1 (lower magnification images are shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI†). The surface of pristine rice husk is smooth (Fig. 1b) and becomes rougher after formic acid treatment for 4 h at 80 °C (Fig. 1c). XRD shows that pristine rice husk has characteristic peaks typical for native cellulose, at ∼15°, ∼16°, 21.8°, 34.7°, assigned to (10), (110), (200), and (004), respectively, similarly with those reported in the literature (Fig. S2†).42–44 After formic acid treatment the XRD pattern remains unchanged indicating that the crystalline cellulose is chemically stable (Fig. S2†). As previously reported by our group45 and others,46 cellulose cannot be converted into hydrothermal carbon at temperatures below 180 °C. Therefore, the HTC process was conducted at 230 °C for 48 h. After hydrothermal treatment, the continuous cellulosic network is not disrupted, which is in good agreement with previously reported results.41 However porosity is developed after this step due to the conversion of cellulose into carbon (Fig. 1d). Here we need to mention that a direct hydrothermal carbonization in a high concentration of formic acid (95 wt%) should be possible but it will corrode the autoclaves at 230 °C (therefore pre-treatment was preferred here). Without such formic acid treatment (namely without removing the hemicellulose and lignin fractions), the rice husk generates a very different morphology (Fig. S3†) without any porosity development. After hydrothermal carbonization at 230 °C, the structure of the resulting HTC carbon is amorphous (see Fig. S1†) with many oxygenated functional groups on the surface.26,45,47,48 In order to increase the level of structural order and the electronic conductivity of the material, calcination at 900 °C in inert atmosphere was performed. The porous network developed during hydrothermal carbonization was well maintained after further carbonization (Fig. 1e). XRD clearly shows an increase in the structural order by the appearance of reflection 002 and 100.26 To address the importance of the hydrothermal carbonization step, a direct pyrolysis of rice husk after the formic acid treatment was also conducted (Fig. S4†). The morphology is compact and it does not exhibit the fibrous porous network observed for the HTC carbon material (Fig. 1e). Thus, we can conclude that hydrothermal carbonization induces important morphological transformations of the cellulose fraction via partial hydrolysis into glucose/hydroxymethylfurfural and conversion into an HTC carbon network.41 Also it is very important to note that the HTC process improves the overall yield from 43% upon direct calcination to 60% upon HTC. This is yet another clear advantage of the intermediate hydrothermal treatment. Looking at the TG curves we can observe a large amount of SiO2 (∼29 wt%) in the rice husk (Fig. S5†) while SiO2 inherits the morphology of rice husk (Fig. S6†). Removal of SiO2 with NH4HF2 leads to the fibrous-like morphology depicted in Fig. 1f. Finally, a fibrous mesoporous carbon derived from rice husk with H/C ratio 0.02 was obtained. The H/C ratio has an important impact on Li storage ability.49,50

The SEM micrographs clearly show developed macroporosity (∼100 nm) after the hydrothermal carbonization step. In order to investigate in detail the nanoporosity of the resulting carbons, N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms have been recorded and the corresponding pore size distribution curves have been determined using the QSDFT method (Fig. 2). The pore properties characteristics derived from N2 isotherms are gathered in ESI Table S1.† The RH-Acid-HTC has a BET surface area of 52 m2 g−1 and a pore volume of 0.12 cm3 g−1 with wide pore size distributions ranging from 0 nm to 23 nm. The low nanoporosity development after hydrothermal carbonization is a normal feature previously described for hydrothermal carbons.23 After calcinations at 900 °C, the surface area and pore volume increased to 135 m2 g−1 and 0.15 cm3 g−1, respectively due to ultramicropore formation.23 After removal of the SiO2 fraction, RH-Acid-HTC-900-HF developed a total pore volume of 0.41 cm3 g−1 and a BET surface area of 243 m2 g−1, exhibiting a Type-IV adsorption–desorption isotherm characteristic to mesoporous materials. As the SiO2 fraction present in rice husk has an inhomogeneous particle size distribution the final carbon derived from rice husk demonstrates a broad size distribution ranging from 0 nm to 25 nm. This could in principle be improved in the future using an “in situ” dissolution–precipitation of the silica fraction during the HTC treatment as described by Baccile, Coradin et al. in a very nice review paper.51 To underline the importance of SiO2 removal for the development of porosity, the N2 isotherms of RH-HTC-900-HF (rice husk directly HTC and further carbonization, without acid pre-treatment) before and after removal of silica was also measured (Fig. S7 and Table S2†). Indeed, the removal of silica can almost double the surface area from 65 m2 g−1 to 98 m2 g−1 concomitantly with increasing pore volume from 0.08 cm3 g−1 to 0.26 cm3 g−1. Although broad in size, the majority of pores are in the mesoporous range. Meanwhile, our findings suggest that the formic acid pretreatment is crucial, as the surface area of the final material (RH-Acid-HTC-900-HF) reaches 243 m2 g−1 (pore volume 0.41 cm3 g−1) as compared to 65 m2 g−1 (pore volume 0.26 cm3 g−1) for the sample without acid pre-treatment (RH-HTC-900-HF).

The carbon derived from rice husk was further assessed as anode in lithium ion batteries. Fig. 3a shows the galvanostatic charge–discharge curves at a current density of 75 mA g−1 (namely 0.2 C, 1 C corresponds to 372 mA g−1). In comparison with the typical charge–discharge profile in graphite with operation voltage at 0.0 V,52 our rice-husk derived carbon has a hysteresis to 1 V for lithium insertion voltage, similarly with petroleum pitch-derived carbons.52 The initial discharge capacity is 789 mA h g−1, which is by far higher than the theoretical capacity of the graphite. The irreversible capacity during lithium desertion is very large (∼396 mA h g−1). This is rather common for carbon based materials and it is partly associated with the decomposition of carbonate-based electrolyte EC-DMC, which can easily have reduction reaction below 1.0 V (versus Li+) and the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the electrode. These results are very similar to the ones obtained by Fey at all using rice-straw derived pyrolytic carbon.17 This drawback could be in principle overcome by surface modification or using a more stable electrolyte under such conditions.53 The highly disordered carbon structure is also responsible for this large irreversible capacity as lithium ions can be trapped into special positions such as in the vicinity of residual H atoms in the carbon material as it was previously reported in the literature.50,54 The cycle performance and coulombic efficiency of the rice-husk derived anode are shown in Fig. 3b and c. Its initial discharge capacity of 396 mA h g−1 increased to 403 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles, which means that an electrochemical activation of SiO2 (still present in very small amounts in the rice-husk carbon) may be responsible for the increase in capacity.55 The coulombic efficiency approaches ∼97% after several cycles, presumably due to incomplete stabilization of SEI.56 For testing the rate performance, the cell was directly discharged/charged at various current densities each for 10 cycles (Fig. 3d). The reversible capacities are 218, 199, 164, and 137 mA h g−1 at 0.375 A g−1 (1 C), 0.75 A g−1 (2 C), 1.875 A g−1 (5 C), and 3.75 A g−1 (10 C, namely 6 minutes to fully charge), respectively. When the rate is turned back to 0.375 A g−1 after cycling at different current rates, the capacity can be recovered (227 mA h g−1). Such a rate performance of carbon completely derived from a lignocellulosic biomass is extremely good. This is comparable to a recent publication from Wu et al., who used nanosized CaCO3 in the presence of a phenolic resin to synthesize porous carbon materials with high rate performances in Li Ion batteries.57 This superior electrochemical performance is attributed to both electronic conductivity gained after further thermal treatment (of 102 S m−1) as well as to its unique mesoporous and macroporous hierarchical nanofibrous network produced by a combination of hemicellulose–lignin etching and conversion of the remaining cellulose via HTC.

Conclusions
In summary, a porous fibrous carbon structure was synthesized from rice husk via acid pretreatment, hydrothermal carbonization, further calcination and SiO2 removal. This structure is made of interdigitated thin carbon fibers derived from a biomass waste and was used as an anode in lithium ion battery. It delivers superior electrochemical performance, especially rate performance (137 mA h g−1 at 10 C, namely charged in 6 minutes). To our best knowledge, this is the first report on the production of a fibrous carbon network directly from biomass. This low cost and facile method brings new perspectives in the synthesis of porous biomass-derived electrodes as well as broadens the scope to other important applications.
