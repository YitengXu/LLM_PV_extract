As a main electrical energy source of electric vehicles (EV) and portable devices, it is hard for the conventional rechargeable batteries to meet the growing energy demand; thus, further exploration of advanced materials for basic components of secondary batteries is necessary. Among the novel materials, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely considered and regarded as promising candidates for the design of next-generation advanced batteries due to their enticing nature including easy preparation, abundant diversity, adjustable porosity, large surface area and high redox activity.

Finally, future outlook including main challenges and feasible solutions for the practical use of MOF-based materials in full cells is further explored.
1. Introduction
With the occurrence of energy crisis, exploration of renewable resources as alternatives for fossil fuels is vital for mitigating the greenhouse effect and pursuing sustainable development. For this issue, some inexhaustible natural resources like wind, solar and tide have been regarded as promising ones to produce electrical energy to meet the growing demands for daily life and industrial production. Although these resources have paved the way for a new development model in line with the concept of green chemistry, they are still hard to serve as continuous energy supply due to some inherent aspects like instability and intermittent nature. As a consequence, the development of electrical energy storage devices becomes necessary for providing continuous electrical energy supply for life activities and industrial production. Among the energy storage devices, rechargeable batteries are excellent candidates which have been widely applied in electric vehicles and other portable devices due to their portability, light weight, considerable energy density and environmental friendliness.1 With the growing energy demands in urban areas and various industries, the performance of rechargeable batteries needs to be further improved to adapt to the development of the modern society.
At present, commercial batteries can be divided into aqueous and nonaqueous ones according to their electrolyte medium, among which nonaqueous batteries have gradually occupied the place of aqueous batteries (except for Pb-acid) in the energy market since the rapid expansion of lithium ion batteries in electric vehicles (EV) and portable electronics.2 Furthermore, the energy revolution in the past few decades, the desire for less emission and higher efficiency has pushed the development of new-generation batteries toward low cost, high energy density, long cycle life and sustainability. With this trend, the exploration of high-performance batteries has become an emerging task and promoted the development and modification of technology and various battery materials for practical use. Generally, the main components of a full cell battery include cathode, anode, electrolyte, and separator which are chemical entities in common, whose rational design, combination and construction can affect the overall performance.3 Therefore, tremendous efforts have been devoted to the research on innovative battery components to achieve higher electrochemical performance.
In 1991, Sony had successfully launched the commercial version of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) assembled with a graphite anode and a LiCoO2 cathode, which have been widely applied later in the transportation and electronics industry.4 Since then, many research studies have been carried out to construct advanced materials to warrant as LIB components, particularly as electrode materials. Owing to the low theoretical capacity of graphite (372 mA h g−1),5 many other materials like transition metal oxides (TMOs) with higher capacity such as Co3O4,6–8 CoO,9,10 Fe2O3,11 and ZnMnO412,13 have been investigated as advanced anodes for LIBs. In these novel materials, the main working mechanisms can be depicted as the conversion between metal compounds and the corresponding metal, which is different from the intercalation mechanism of the conventional graphite anode and can be utilized for enhancing the theoretical capacity and cycling reversibility. Meanwhile, many attempts have been made to overcome the flaws of the commercial LiCoO2 cathode such as the low lithium conversion rate and structural instability caused by ion dissolution and structural collapse.14 To overcome the above problems, some modifying methods such as nanonization15 and surface engineering16 have been proposed in recent years. These exciting results have promoted the development of materials science and exploration of high-performance LIB electrodes for the future energy requirements. In terms of advanced electrodes, Li metal anodes have also drawn much attention due to their ultrahigh capacity and energy density; however, some disadvantages including large volume change, extensive growth of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) caused by the side reactions between electrolytes and Li, and Li dendrite growth which causes safety hazards limited their practical applications.17 To address the above issues, some studies on surface modification,18 adjustable interfacial reactions19 and dendrite-free Li deposition20 have been carried out, which shed lights on the development of high-performance Li anodes with high stability and good safety.
In spite of the fruitful results in the research for advanced lithium batteries providing opportunities for energy revolution, the scarcity and high cost of lithium would bring challenges to the sustainable development of the related fields. Therefore, finding suitable alternatives for lithium batteries is a basic challenge for the expansion of future energy supply. Owing to the similar features of alkali metals, other alkali metal based batteries have been regarded as the promising alternatives of lithium batteries. Owing to the abundant sources and low cost of sodium and potassium in comparison to lithium, sodium ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium ion batteries (PIBs) have been considered as promising technologies to occupy the place of LIBs in the future; however, exploration of suitable materials for high Na/K storage capacity is another challenge due to the larger ionic radii of Na+ and K+ than Li+.21,22 Beginning with lithium ion storage materials, many novel LIB electrodes have also been employed in Na and K storage, indicating that high-performance Li storage materials are applicable in other metal ion storage due to their similar physical and chemical characteristics. Other than the nonaqueous systems for the above active metal, some new research studies have also been made on aqueous batteries due to their good safety, low cost, high energy density and environmental friendliness.23 These encouraging results have promoted the development and update of battery technologies and driven the innovation of other fields such as new materials.
In the past few decades, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have drawn a lot of attention due to their enticing features including their tunable structure, diversity, large porosity and high specific surface area.24 Based on these specific advantages, MOFs have been widely applied in different fields including biomedical science,25 gas storage26 and chemical sensors.27 As a kind of crystalline porous material, numerous efforts have been devoted for the protocols of MOF material synthesis, resulting in the discovery of over 12000 kinds of MOFs early in 2005.28 The major components of MOFs include organic ligands/linkers with functional groups to construct an open framework, and the metal ions/clusters as the centers, particularly transition metals with high redox activity. By using proper organic linkers including the bi-, tri-, tetra- or multidentate ligands, specific topologies with a high specific area (ultrahigh porosity) and suitable pore apertures can be obtained for applications as functional materials, which has evolved into a new field called MOF chemistry.29 In the past few decades, extensive research studies on pristine MOFs have been carried out due to the complex combination between metal ion nodes and organic linkers, which provided uncountable possibilities for novel material discoveries. Additionally, desirable compositions and structures can be obtained by using pristine MOFs as self-sacrificing templates using controllable synthetic protocols under optimized conditions including heat treatment under specific atmosphere and temperature as well as simple chemical reactions to remove or import ingredients.30 Due to the porosity and redox activity of MOFs, they have been widely employed as electrochemically active materials and utilized as precursors for directional synthesis of MOF derivatives for expansion in energy applications.31,32 Owing to the increasing enthusiasm in electrochemistry and potential of MOF-based materials for electrical devices, many attempts have been carried out to utilize MOF chemistry for energy storage and conversion, rechargeable batteries particularly (Fig. 1).

With the copious increase of reports on novel materials and energy industry, many reviews in combination of MOF chemistry and battery technologies have been published to guide future research. For instance, Shrivastav et al. provided a comprehensive overview of the utilization of MOFs and MOF-derived composites as advanced electrodes for lithium batteries (lithium ion batteries, lithium sulfur batteries and lithium–oxygen batteries), proposing novel means for efficient energy storage.35 More specifically, Zhang et al. documented the synthetic methods of pristine MOFs, MOF-based composites and MOF-derived materials as well as their applications as high-performance cathodes and anodes in rechargeable lithium ion batteries.34 An appraisement of the applications of MOF-based materials as advanced cathodes for various batteries has been highlighted.36 Despite the fruitful results that confirm the applicability of MOF-based materials as battery components, there have been few research studies that associate MOF chemistry with practical utilization in battery full cells, which becomes the main obstacle for the application of MOF-based materials in battery industries. In order to push the practical use of MOFs, herein, we presented a review to cover the applications of MOF-based materials as different components including electrodes, separators, electrolytes and electrocatalysts in full cell systems. First, the controllable synthetic protocols of MOFs and their corresponding derivatives have been categorized and compared. Afterward, the applications of directionally designed MOF-based materials in various full cells including lithium ion/metal batteries, sodium ion/metal batteries, aqueous batteries, fuel cells and other rechargeable batteries have been analyzed in detail. Finally, we discussed the challenges and perspective of the practical applications and large-scale commercialization of MOF chemistry based advanced batteries, indicating the potential of MOF-based materials in future energy supply.
2. Synthetic strategies of MOF-based materials
The fascinating features of MOF-based materials including high porosity, remarkable specific surface area and abundant redox sites are important to consider in energy storage systems. In order to obtain specific structure and composition for targeted applications, MOF-based materials require precise control at the molecular level through crystallographic engineering. In recent years, many studies have documented the synthetic strategies of MOFs and their derivatives by adjusting various parameters including reacting temperature, solvent type, atmosphere and so on, paving the way for novel designed functional materials. For example, Silva et al. provided an overview of the relationship of applicability and parameters including primary building blocks and synthetic methods.37 Due to the adjustable crystal structure and suitable pores, MOF-based materials show the potential for a wide range of applications in different fields of the industrial society such as sensors, luminescent materials, electrode materials, etc. Among these attractive characteristics, the potential as a candidate for the next-generation energy storage and conversion system has been thoroughly studied and explored in the past few years. Zhao et al. analyzed different methods to fabricate pristine MOFs and their derivatives including porous carbon and metal oxides, demonstrating their impact on energy storage and conversion.38 Based on the same metal sources and organic ligands, the morphology of MOFs is controllable by adjusting parameters like reacting time, temperature, solvent, pH, etc. By retaining the micro- and meso-porous nanostructures of the precursors, MOF derivatives with a specific particle size, shape and composition can be designed to meet the directional requirement. To our best knowledge, directional synthesis is essential for the required electrochemical performance, especially when matched with commercial electrodes. Herein, we briefly discuss the relationship between the properties of MOF-based materials for energy storage system and their synthetic strategies, as summarized and compared in Table 1.

Hydrothermal process is a feasible strategy to synthesize pristine MOFs with organic ligands soluble in water. Early in 2010, Nguyen et al. fabricated MIL-136(Ni, Co) with an organic ligand named tetrathiafulvalene tetracarboxylic acid ((TTF-TC)H4) and metal salts of nickel and cobalt using water as the solvent under different conditions (molar ratio, pH, and temperature).39 This comparative study indicated that the crystallographic properties are closely related to the adjustment of the reacting systems. When using other organic ligands with relatively good water solubility, the hydrothermal method can also be considered. MIL-116 (Fe) with a hexagonal crystal structure was prepared via the hydrothermal process using FeCl2·4H2O and mellitic acid.40 Based on the aqueous reaction system, the room temperature stirring method is a more environmentally friendly and facile way, which is applicable for the preparation of Prussian blue and ZIF (zeolitic imidazolate framework) coordination compounds. For example, a Prussian blue analogue Co3[Co(CN)6]2 could be obtained via mixing K3[Co(CN)6]2 and Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O in deionized water followed by stirring at room temperature for 24 h and the aging step at 25 °C.41 Similarly, ZIF-67 was prepared by dissolving cobalt nitrate hexahydrate and 2-methylimidazole in water followed by stirring and aging steps.42 As shown in Fig. 2a, the as-prepared ZIF-67 was dispersed and stirred in PVDF, then coated on the polypropylene (PP) separator.

For non-aqueous reaction systems, solvothermal is another widely accepted method to prepare MOFs with organic ligands soluble in organic solvents like N,N′-dimethylformamide (DMF) and ethanol. Initially, Fe-MIL series including MIL-53 (Fe)43 and MIL-68 (Fe)44 with terephthalic acid as the ligand prepared via solvothermal method in N,N′-dimethylformamide were reported. These findings indicated that organic solvents are suitable for most organic substances with poor water solubility. Later on, Maiti et al. synthesized Mn-BTC by dissolving Mn(NO3)2·4H2O and trimesic acid (1,3,5-H3BTC) in ethanol and heating at 160 °C solvothermally for 4 days.45 This method has also been applied for the synthesis of other BTC-based MOFs. Ge et al. successfully fabricated Co-BTC by the solvothermal treatment of Co(OAc)2·4H2O and H3BTC in the mixed solvent of DMF and ethanol (volume ratio = 2:1) at 200 °C for 8 h in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (Fig. 2b).46
Based on the above synthetic routes, MOF derivatives can be constructed via in situ thermal treatment or importing other substances by simple chemical reactions or surface modification. During the annealing process, morphologies of the resulting products can not only be determined by the structures of MOF self-sacrificing templates but also by parameters such as temperature and gas atmosphere. Using the same synthetic procedure, the morphology of final products can be adjusted by the structure of the MOF precursors. For example, rod-like Co3O4 and cube-like Co3O4 were fabricated with rod-like Co6(btc)4(tpt)2(H2O)12 and cube like Co9(btc)6(tpt)2(H2O)15 (H3btc = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid, tpt = 2,4,6-tris(4-pyridyl)-1,3,5-triazine) as precursors, respectively (Fig. 3a).47 The final products successfully retain the morphology of their parent templates, indicating the feasibility of structural control by adjusting the self-sacrificing templates. Other than adjustment of the proportion of the reactants, adjustment of metal salts and organic ligand is also vital for the controllable structures of the resulting products. Yin et al. synthesized a series of Ni–Mn–MOFs with various organic ligands and used them as the precursors to prepare LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4via the same procedures of pre-fire steps and high-temperature calcination steps with CH3COOLi as the Li source.48 These examples demonstrated the function of MOF precursors as structural controlling agents and provided experience for directional preparation.

Other than the MOF precursors, the annealing process plays an important role in adjusting the composition and structure of the resulting materials. Notably, pure metal oxides can be easily obtained under oxidation atmosphere with the complete decomposition of the organic parts in the MOF templates, while metal nanoparticles and carbon matrix are more easily retained under a protective reduction gas atmosphere such as N2 and Ar. Li et al. designed a novel composite with Co nanoparticles embedded in N-doped carbon (denoted as Co–N–C) by the thermal treatment of ZIF-67 under protective N2 flow.49 Compared with the oxidation atmosphere, carbon matrix is more easily inherited from the MOF precursors, and Co ions can be reduced to metallic Co, which can be attributed to the reaction between cobalt oxide and carbon. With the same precursors and gas atmosphere, the carbonization temperature can determine the composition and particle size of the targeted products. In 2018, Zhong et al. fabricated core–shell composites composed of the Co/Co3O4 nanoparticles and N-doped carbon shell with the same precursor [Co3(TATAB)2(TPT)2(H2O)10]·DMF·4H2O (NUM-6) containing 4,4′,4′′-((1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triyl)tris-(azanediyl))tribenzoic acid (H3TATAB) and 2,4,6-tris-(pyridin-4-yl)-1,3,5-triazine (TPT) as ligands via high-temperature carbonization in N2 at 600 °C, 700 °C and 800 °C (denoted as Co/Co3O4@N–C-600, Co/Co3O4@N–C-700, and Co/Co3O4@N–C-800, respectively) followed by low temperature oxidation in air at 250 °C (Fig. 3b).50 Three composites with different particle sizes and proportions can be obtained under different carbonization temperatures, indicating that temperature is another important parameter for controllable synthesis.
Based on in situ pyrolysis, more complex structure and composition of targeted products can be obtained by importing other substances in the reacting systems. As known, metal oxides (MO), metal/carbon composites (M/C) or metal oxides/carbon composites (MO/C) are the common products of in situ pyrolysis of the corresponding MOF precursors. Furthermore, other elements such as S, Se, and P can be imported to the final products via simple chemical reactions or using hard substrates. For instance, NiS nanoparticles can be evenly dispersed in a carbon matrix (C ⊃ NiS) via in situ carbonization of MOF-74 (Ni) under reducing atmosphere followed by the sulfurization step with thiourea as the S source.51 In this process, the nanoporous structure can be successfully retained from the MOF template, indicating that simple chemical treatments do not destroy the original morphology. Other than simple chemical reactions, some components can be imported by using hard templates which do not participate in the chemical reactions. Liu et al. fabricated Ni-doped Co–Co2N heterostructure arrays (denoted as Ni/Co–N-350) via the in situ growth of two-dimensional (2D) cobalt-based ZIF-L flakes on flexible carbon cloth and heat treatment in air at 350 °C with Ni(NO3)2 to produce NiCo2O4 followed by thermal treatment in NH3 atmosphere.52 These interesting results indicated more possibility for the construction of complex structures by mixing MOF self-sacrificing templates and hard substrates, which is a good example for morphology control.
3. Lithium batteries
Lithium batteries are a class of secondary batteries working via the redox reactions of Li elements in both ion and metal forms, which can achieve charge transfer by the valence shift of Li. At present, there are several commonly used lithium battery systems like lithium-ion batteries, lithium metal batteries, lithium sulfur batteries and lithium–oxygen/air batteries. In order to enhance the lithium species utilization for electrochemical efficiency, many MOF-based materials have been designed for different components of lithium batteries including cathodes, anodes, separators and electrolytes. In this section, we will discuss various lithium battery systems composed of MOF-based materials.
3.1 Lithium-ion batteries
With the growing requirement of power for electric vehicles (EV) and other portable devices, the performance of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) needs to be further improved. Since their commercialization in 1991 by Sony, graphite has been used as anode and LiCoO2 has been used as cathode for LIBs on a large scale; however, they still have a big room for improvement due to the low capacity and poor stability.53,54 In order to achieve high efficiency performance, MOF-derived materials have drawn much attention due to their high theoretical specific capacities and excellent electrochemical activities. As a result of numerous efforts of researchers, some MOF-based materials have been well-designed and matched with commercial electrode materials, resulting in superior full cell electrochemical performance. These results indicate the potential of MOF-based materials for practical use in full cell systems.

3.1.1 Cathode. 
Traditional cathode materials like LiCoO2 face problems such as capacity degradation, poor safety, and high toxicity. Therefore, using MOF-derived methods to obtain specific ingredients and structures is a feasible strategy to obtain the required electrochemical performance. Although methods of modifying cathode materials such as in situ pyrolysis and surface modification have been proposed for decades, there are still few studies on the application of MOF-based cathodes in lithium-ion full cells with graphite as the anode. For instance, Xue et al. used UIO-66 prepared via the traditional solvothermal treatment of zirconium(IV) chloride and terephthalic acid as additive to modify the Ni-rich (Ni content > 0.6) cathode material i.e. LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2.55 Remarkably, LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 with 2 wt% UiO-66 additive (denoted as UNCM-2) delivered an excellent capacity retention of two times as that of the sample without UiO-66, which can be ascribed to the alleviation of metal dissolution and structural collapse during long run cycling. In addition to surface modification, 3D self-standing method is a promising way to improve the structural stability to adapt to more demanding working conditions. Recently, Lin et al. reported a novel strategy to grow hexagonal layered LiCoO2 on a 3D Au-coated copper foam substrate (denoted as LCO@ACF) by using Li-doped ZIF-67 (denoted as Li@ZIF67) as the MOF template (Fig. 4a).56 The as-constructed LCO@ACF cathode delivered excellent performance under harsh conditions at 50 °C in LCO@ACF‖graphite LIB full cell, providing prospects for design of high-performance MOF-based electrodes with hard substrates. More importantly, LCO@ACF‖graphite LIB full cell delivered excellent rate performance at different current densities (146.3 mA h g−1 at 0.5C and 89.6 mA h g−1 at 10C) and superior cycle life with a capacity retention of 68% after 600 cycles at 2C.

(d) Charge/discharge profiles at 40 mA g−1 and (e) cycling performance of the NMC-622‖MOF full cell.62 Copyright © 2020, American Chemical Society. 
In the above examples, mechanical robustness and cycling stability are the key points for the design of cathodes for the LIB full cells, which are also important issues in need of improvement in the commercial materials. Generally, there are three main strategies to enhance the cycling life of LIB cathodes: (1) nanonization of the lithium transition metal salts by using MOFs as self-sacrificing templates; (2) surface modification to address the dissolution of the active materials; and (3) utilization of 3D hard substrates for enhanced structural robustness and cycling stability.


3.1.2 Anode. 
The low theoretical specific capacity of traditional graphite anode is a bottleneck to meet the energy storage requirements of new generation lithium-ion batteries, which provides space for development for porous materials. To date, tremendous efforts have been devoted to construct MOF-based anodes for LIBs in order to obtain higher capacity when working in LIB full cells with commercial cathodes. Among these reported MOF-based anodes, pristine MOFs with abundant redox active sites provided by metal ion centers and organic moieties have been confirmed to be the promising candidates due to their environmentally friendly materials with facile synthetic routes and high energy density. Initially, Song et al. synthesized a one dimension (1D) MOF CoCOP via facile hydrothermal reaction and investigated it as the anode for Li-ion full cell with LiFePO4, which provided a capacity retention of 83% after 300 cycles at 1C rate.57 Similarly, other valence metals can also be used as redox active centers. Later on, a series of metal inorganic–organic hybrid composites (M-IOHCs, M = Mn, Ni, Co) with higher lithium storage capacity have been reported.58 Among these M-IOHC anodes, Ni-IOHCs delivered a high energy density of 297 W h kg−1 at 32 W kg−1 when coupled with LiFePO4 cathode in a full cell system.
In order to pursue lower expense and lower toxicity, some researchers attempted to use Fe-based MOFs as anodes for LIB full cells. Shen et al. used Fe3O(BDC)3(H2O)2(NO3) (Fe-MIL-88B) as the anode for CR2032 full cells with LiFePO4 powders as the cathode, which confirmed that this Fe-MOF is a promising candidate for the stable lithiation/delithiation processes.59 Likewise, Sharma et al. reported another Fe-MOF configured with two ligands including terephthalic acid (H2BDC) and naphthalene dicarboxylic acid (H2NDC) as the anode for a full cell constructed with a LiCoO2 cathode.60 Surprisingly, this full cell delivered a considerable power density of 360 W h kg−1 at 500 mA g−1 with long-term cycling stability. In general, the as-studied MOF anode achieved combination with lithium ion through metal valence transformation. However, some conductive MOFs do not require the participation of metal elements in the charge/discharge cycling process. Guo et al. designed a one-dimensional (1D) Cu-based conductive MOF with 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene as the ligand (denoted as Cu-CAT) via solvothermal treatment.61 When assembled with the LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode, the full cell exhibited a remarkable energy density of 257 W h kg−1 and good cycling stability. As depicted in Fig. 4b and c, the nanowires (NWs) with approximately 70 nm in diameter connected randomly to build a three-dimension (3D) network, which contributed to the penetration and diffusion of Li ions and electrolytes. Recently, [Zn2(py-TTF-py)2(BDC)2]·2DMF·H2O with 2,6-bis(4′-pyridyl)tetrathiafulvalene and terephthalic acid as the ligands was synthesized and assembled with NMC-622 as the ternary cathode material.62 During the cycling process, the valence of zinc remains at +2, while lithium ions bond with sulfur to be embedded in the organic framework. As shown in Fig. 4d and 4e, the coulombic efficiency of the NMC 622‖MOF full cell increased in the first 10 cycles at 40 mA g−1 from 65.2% to 99.45%, while a high reversible capacity of 131.9 mA h g−1 and a coulombic efficiency of 99.45% at 100 mA g−1 after 60 cycles were observed.
Other than using MOFs as anodes directly, the in situ growth preparation of MOF-based composites is another promising strategy for the utilization of different components for battery applications. Based on the high theoretical specific capacity of Si and the reasonable pore structure of MOFs, MOFs can be considered to combine with Si to relieve volume expansion, achieve higher stability and obtain higher lithium storage capacity. Zhou et al. encapsulated silicon nanoparticles with well-designed rod like cross-linking Sn-MOF with phthalic acid as the organic ligand (Fig. 5a).63 Owing to reasonable hybridization with good synergy, the Si@Sn-MOF composite exhibited a discharge capacity of 117.7 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles when investigated as an anode for Li-ion full cell with LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O4 cathode at a potential range from 2.8 to 4.3 V. Similarly, a Si anode coated with a two-dimension MOF named Cu3(HITP)2 (HITP = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotriphenylene) was fabricated and applied in a full cell with LiCoO2 as the cathode.64 The full cell delivered high capacities at different current densities due to the promising volume expansion buffer and conductivity improvement. For the construction of a conductive network, rGO has been used as a hard template for the in situ growth of a Co-MOF named Co2[Fx(OH)1−x]2(C8O4H4) (denoted as F–Co-MOF).65 When applied as an anode for full cell with LiFePO4 as the cathode, this F–Co-MOF/rGO composite provided a reversible capacity of 162.5 mA h g−1 at a current density of 200 mA g−1 after 300 cycles.

In comparison with pristine MOFs, MOF derivatives deliver better practical application potential in lithium-ion batteries due to their higher conductivity and cycling stability. Through the pyrolysis of the organic framework, the metal elements or other heteroatoms can be evenly distributed in the porous carbon matrix. Yu et al. reported NiSb⊂CHSs (NiSb-embedded carbon hollow spheres) prepared via the thermal treatment of Ni-MOF in an H2/Ar atmosphere followed by ultrasonication in ethanol with SbCl3.66 When characterized at a high voltage of 3.5 V, NiSb⊂CHSs//LiMn2O4 full cell exhibited excellent rate capacity and coulombic efficiency of nearly 100%. Recently, a two-step sacrificial template method of annealing Ni–Co-MOF nanosphere precursors under reducing atmospheres to fabricate Ni–Co–Sb/C was proposed.67 The Ni–Co–Sb/C can provide a high capacity of 354 mA h g−1 when assembled with the LiCoO2 cathode due to the alloying mechanism. The sacrificial template method can also be applied to prepare a Si-based anode in which the in situ generated carbon with a porous structure develops a higher specific surface area. Yoon et al. successfully prepared mesoporous silicon hollow nanocubes (m-Si HCs) by using ZIF-8 as the sacrificial template.68 The good results after electrochemical characterization in full cell with LiCoO2 indicated that this template method is an effective and easy way to synthesize high-performance anode materials.
By changing the gas atmosphere and calcination temperature, metal oxides with different structures and properties can be easily obtained by using MOFs as the sacrificial template, especially under an oxidizing atmosphere. Sun et al. synthesized Co3O4via both two-step and one-step calcination of Co-MOF precursor, respectively.69 Owing to the unique porous starfish-like structure, the Co3O4@N–C prepared via the two-step method can effectively buffer volume expansion and provided stable discharge capacity. Moreover, Co3O4@N–C/LiFePO4 exhibited a high capacity retention of 95% after 100 cycles. Calcination of Co-MOFs that contain heteroatoms or with other additives produces cobalt oxide composites giving full play to each component for superior performance. For instance, Zn or Ni doped Co3O4 fabricated using zinc or nickel co-doped ZIF-67 as the precursor can deliver an excellent and stable capacity of 1600 mA h g−1 in the Li-ion full cell with LiNi0.5Co0.3Mn0.2O2 cathode.70 Recently, Fei et al. constructed a one-dimensional bunched Ni–MoO2@Co–CoO–NC composite by the carbonization of ZIF-67 polyhedron along with NiMoO4·xH2O under an Ar/H2 atmosphere.71 Benefitting from the well-designed morphology and synergistic effects of variable metal, the Ni–MoO2@Co–CoO–NC composite delivered both half-cell and full cell performance coupled with the LiFePO4 cathode.
For environmental friendliness and to achieve better economic efficiency, some research groups used to prepare iron based metal oxides and their composites by using the MOF-template method. Fan et al. constructed Fe2O3 nanosheets with a bi-continuous porous structure (denoted as bp-Fe2O3) by heat treatment of Fe-MOF i.e., C103H118ClN12O66Fe6, in N2 flow at 450 °C.72 This MOF-derived bp-Fe2O3 exerted enhanced lithium storage capacity by providing shorter paths and a larger contacting area between active materials and the electrolyte with its hierarchical pores and 2D structure. Remarkably, this advanced anode could not only provide high performance in half-cell at low temperatures but also exhibit considerable reversible capacity in a bp-Fe2O3‖LiFePO4 full cell. It has been confirmed that importing of carbon and heteroatoms is conductive to the improvement of conductivity in MOF-derived iron oxide-based anode materials. A new composite (denoted as PGF@pFe2O3NF) with a porous Fe2O3 framework grown on three-dimensional P-doped graphene framework was designed via the in situ growth of Fe-based Prussian blue followed by the annealing processes in air and N2.73 As shown in Fig. 5b, Fe2O3 particles in the as-fabricated PGF@pFe2O3NF possessed a highly nanoporous framework, in which crystal lattice fringe at 0.25 nm was well in line with the (111) plane of α-Fe2O3. Fig. 5c–g illustrate the uniform distribution of C, O, Fe, and P in the as-fabricated PGF@pFe2O3NF composite. When coupled with LiCoO2, the full cell delivered a high energy density of 350.8 W h kg−1, which is superior to the most as-designed Fe2O3-based anode. Other than Fe2O3, Fe3O4 has also been prepared for LIB anode materials due to the similar working mechanism of reduction to metallic Fe. Liu et al. reported a porous N-doped Fe3O4 carbon composite (denoted as Fe3O4@N–C) derived from a N-rich Fe-MOF synthesized with 2-methylimidazole (2-MI) and terephthalic acid.74 Owing to the synergistic effect of porous carbon and nitrogen doping, Fe3O4@N–C delivered both considerable half-cell and full cell performances coupled with LiCoO2. Another strategy used to simultaneously realize the combination of two iron oxides and heteroatom-doped carbon coating was also reported. Recently, Hu et al. used Fe4-based metal–organic clusters (Fe-MOCs) as a precursor to fabricate S,N-co-doped carbon coated iron oxides (denoted as Fe2O3@Fe3O4–SNC) by calcination in N2 atmosphere.75 The density functional theory (DFT) study indicated that the special architecture of Fe2O3@Fe3O4–SNC can achieve easy adsorption with low energy barrier, resulting in excellent energy density and power density when investigated as anode in a full cell system with commercial LiCoO2 as the cathode.
In addition to iron oxides, other metal oxides that are less harmful to the environment can also be used to achieve redox processes in LIBs. For instance, Mn3O4@C was prepared by self-template pyrolysis of Mn-BDC (H2BDC = terephthalic acid) MOF in N2.76 The ex situ XPS study indicated the two-step reduction of Mn3O4 into MnO and Mn as well as the reversible transition between Mn and MnO after the initial cycle. By comparing the differential capacity curves of Mn3O4 and Mn3O4@C, the reduction peaks located at 1.24 V, 0.87 V and 0.35 V can be ascribed to reduction from Mn3O4 to MnO, SEI formation and reduction from MnO to metallic Mn (Fig. 5h and i). Benefiting from the carbon matrix which can protect the active substance and enhance conductivity, the Mn3O4@C‖NCM-523 LIB full cell exhibited a high capacity retention of approximately 73% at 200 mA g−1 after 100 cycles. ZnO can be easily obtained by the thermal treatment of ZIF-8 precursor, which can achieve lithiation by reduction to metallic Zn. Zhu et al. reported a composite with ZnO nanoparticles embedded in N-doped carbon nanoplate arrays grown on a N-doped carbon paper (denoted as ZnO/NC NPAs@NCP).77 Notably, the full cell with ZnO/NC NPAs@NCP anode and commercial LiFePO4 cathode displayed a reversible capacity of 378 mA h g−1 after 40 cycles, which indicated the potential of this composite to be applied as a low-cost electrode with light weight.
In order to strengthen the synergistic effect of the variable metals, bimetallic oxides have been investigated as anodes in LIB full cell. Early in 2016, Xia et al. reported a kind of Ni–Fe bimetallic oxide namely Ni0.62Fe2.38O4 (denoted as NFO-0.25) derived from Ni/Fe MIL-88 with a nanotube structure and a large specific area of 134.3 m2 g−1.78 Due to the reasonable design of primary particles and synergistic effect of Ni and Fe, the NFO-0.25/LiCoO2 full-cell displayed high reversible capacity and considerable Coulombic efficiency. Similarly, another Zn–Mn bimetallic oxide carbon composite Zn0.5MnO@C was synthesized by annealing Zn–Mn–BTC (H2BTC = trimesic acid) in Argon and assembled with LiMn2O4 cathode as a LIB full cell.79 As exhibited in Fig. 6a, the architecture of hollow hexagonal nanodisks was well inherited from the MOF precursor. Encouragingly, this full cell could deliver a stable reversible capacity in the first 120 cycles, which demonstrated that a feasible reactant ratio is an important factor to improve electrochemical performance.

Other metal compounds including metal sulfides, metal selenides and metal phosphides can also achieve lithium storage by generating the corresponding metal and lithium compounds. Based on the high theoretical capacity and big volume change of metal sulfides, carbon coating and nano structure fabrication are promising methods for higher conductivity and better stability. Ma et al. synthesized a composite with α-MnS nanoparticles embedded in S-doped carbonaceous mesoporous frameworks (denoted as α-MnS/SCMFs) by sulfidation of a Mn-MOF precursor with terephthalic acid ligand at 600 °C under an Ar atmosphere.80 This α-MnS/SCMF anode can achieve lithium storage by the generation of metallic Mn and Li2S, presenting impressive capacity retention when investigated in a full cell with commercial LiMn1/3Co1/3Ni1/3O2 as the cathode. Core–shell materials are good examples for integration of different active anode materials for better synergistic effect. For example, Huang et al. proposed the rational construction of the core–shell Bi2S3@Co9S8 complex hollow particles (CHPs) by hydrothermal sulfidation and thermal treatment at a low temperature of a core–shell BiOBr@ZIF-67 template.81 Owing to the well-designed core–shell structure, high capacity of Co9S8 and a large contacting area between the electrolyte and active substances, Bi2S3@Co9S8 CHPs delivered good stability and attractive rate capacity when working as anode for LIB full cell coupled with the LiFePO4 cathode. Based on a similar redox mechanism, metal selenides have been considered to be promising candidates for lithium storage, which can also be easily obtained via simple selenization reactions. The DFT study results demonstrated that ZnSe–NC@CoSe2–NC derived from core–shell ZIF-8@ZIF-67 polyhedrons possessed low adsorption energy and fast charge transfer, which contributed to satisfied performance of ZnSe–NC@CoSe2–NC‖LiCoO2 full cell with excellent discharge capacity and coulombic efficiency.82
Additionally, metal phosphides are another class of substances which have been extensively studied in energy storage system. However, large volume expansion and agglomeration effects limit their large-scale application, which can be addressed by carbon coating. Tao et al. prepared Ni-MOF by solvothermal reaction and later used it as a precursor to synthesize Ni2P/NC porous spheres via phosphidation at 350 °C in N2 with NaH2PO2 as the phosphorus source.83 Benefitting from the effective encapsulation of phosphorus species and mesoporous architecture, good storage and fast transmission of lithium ions could be achieved, resulting in long cycling life and good rate capacity of the LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2‖Ni2P/NC full cell. The above fruitful results demonstrated the good redox activity of transition metal compounds as promising candidates for new generation LIB anode application. Nevertheless, there are few reports comparing the different active substances derived from the same precursor, summarizing the synthetic route and performance of metal compounds comprehensively. Recently, Wang et al. prepared Ni-MOF as a precursor for the fabrication of NiX micro-flowers (X = O, S and Se) and compared their electrochemical performances when working as LIB anodes.84 As depicted in Fig. 6b–d, all the three composites derived from Ni-MOF micro-flowers were found to well retain the flower-like morphology. Among the as-designed anodes with abundant pores, the NiSe/C composite displayed the highest reversible capacity of 1016.5 mA h g−1 at a high current density of 1 A g−1 after 1000 cycles with remarkable full cell performance coupled with LiCoO2 cathode. Interestingly, the discharge capacity of NiSe/C anode increased after the 2nd cycle due to the pseudocapacitance contribution and carbon layer which can protect the active substances and enhance conductivity. This comparative study has provided experience for the directional preparation of transition metal oxides/sulfides/selenides (TMOSS) by annealing the MOF template and paved the way for the design and development of novel anode materials. The summary for electrochemical performance of rechargeable LIB full cells assembled with MOF-based anodes and commercial cathodes is presented in Table 2.

According to most studies on MOF-based anode materials in LIBs, two mechanisms including intercalation and conversion govern the discharge/charge process. During the design of MOF-based anodes for LIB full cells, the following aspects need to be taken into account: (1) abundant active sites for the redox reaction; (2) tunable porosity for easier transmission of electrons and Li ions; (3) construction of a conductive network by carbonization and importing heteroatoms; (4) utilization of the synergistic effect between different components for higher lithium storage capacity.


3.1.3 Other applications. 
Numerous efforts have been devoted to fabricate electrodes for LIBs, anode particularly, which indicated that MOF-based materials are promising candidates for next generation energy storage devices. Besides electrodes, MOF-based materials as electrolytes and separators are also vital for a LIB full cell system and can make great difference to the performances including energy density, cycle stability and efficiency. In ordinary full cell systems, the side reactions of electrolyte and electrode active material will reduce the cycle stability and coulombic efficiency. Therefore, a reasonably designed separator is conducive to the shuttle of tissue materials to prevent the consumption of active materials by side reactions. In order to adapt to the high voltage working condition, Qiao et al. designed a MOF-based separator by coating Cu3(BTC)2 (H3BTC = benzene-1,3,4-tricarboxylate) on the commercial polypropylene (PP) for LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (5 V-class)/graphite Li-ion full-cell with ionic liquid (Li/Pyr13TFSI) catholyte and LiTFSI/G3 anolyte (Fig. 6e).85Fig. 6f and g illustrate the excellent cycling stability at a relatively low current density and at different temperatures, high output voltage as well as the remarkable rate capacity at an evaluated temperature of 55 °C for the as-assembled full cell. Notably, the Cu-MOF-based separator can effectively avoid the crossover effect and provided isolated environments for both electrodes and their electrolytes, leading to an excellent capacity retention of 83.8% after 1000 cycles. The above example confirmed that taking advantage of the porosity of MOFs for Li+ transmission and shuttle avoidance is a promising strategy to prevent side reactions and improve active material utilization.
Moreover, the properties of the electrolytes are also vital for the electrochemical performance of full cell systems. For better ionic conductivity and interface stability, Lu et al. utilized the UiO-66 (Zr) MOF as new fillers for gel polymer electrolytes (GPL).86 Owing to the open-metal sites, the GPL electrolyte displayed a high ionic conductivity and Li+ transference number as well as stable interfaces for electrodes, resulting in good durability of Li4Ti5O12‖LiFePO4 full cell. By utilizing the ability of MOFs to conduct and transport lithium ions, the modified separator and solid electrolyte are beneficial to the improvement of the efficiency of the LIB full cells.
Apparently, other than the improvement in electrode materials, MOF-based materials also delivered enticing potential in the modification of electrolytes and separators. When utilized as modifiers for the separators, the confinement of the active materials for the alleviation of the side reactions and the high ionic conductivity for easy Li+ transmission between the electrodes are main considerations. Thus conductive frameworks and stable interface are vital for the cycling stability of the LIB full cells. As the fillers of the electrolytes, the MOF-based materials need to maintain the efficiency of ion transport and simultaneously form a stable SEI film on each electrode during cycling, which is beneficial to the enhancement of capacity retention and coulombic efficiency.

3.2 Lithium metal batteries
Compared with LIBs, poor safety and cycling stability of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) taper their reputation and limit their popularity. During the cycling process, metallic Li can easily react with the electrolyte, leading to the growth of lithium dendrites, unstable interfaces, large volume changes and hence the short circuiting. Therefore, enhancing the stability of lithium anode is a key technical issue to improve the electrochemical performance and applicability of lithium metal full cells. In recent days, MOF-based materials have been considered as a promising candidate to address the shortcomings of Li anodes. Due to the prohibition of Li dendrite growth, MOF-based materials have been regarded as the suitable alternatives for the conventional cell components including electrolytes, separators and Li metal anodes, whose performances are summarized in Table 3.

Considering the abundant sites that can combine with lithium species, pristine MOFs are promising candidates to alleviate the growth of lithium dendrites, which can be used for additives of electrolytes and separators. For example, Yuan et al. proposed a Grotthuss-like mechanism for Cu-MOF-74 to confine Li+ with perchlorate groups.87 When applied as single-ion electrolyte for Li‖LiFePO4 and Li‖LiMn2O4 full cells, capacity retention can be enhanced with a long cycle life, which can be ascribed to the alleviation of lithium dendrite growth and metal dissolution contributed by the MOF-based single-ion electrolyte. To our best knowledge, importing fillers into solid polymer electrolytes is an effective way to enhance the electrochemical performances and mechanical stability. For higher electrochemical stability and lithium ion transference number, Lei et al. used ZIF-8 as fillers for poly(ethyleneoxide)(PEO)-based solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs).88 Surprisingly, the composite SPE could provide higher ionic conductivity, more stable interface and fewer lithium dendrites, resulting in higher capacity retention of 85% at 60 °C for LiFePO4‖Li full cell than the one without the MOF filler of merely 68%. A MOF-engaged solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) with impressive mechanical strength and ionic conductivity was also reported.89 Owing to the interactions between UIO-66, tetrakis (3-mercaptopropionic acid) pentaerythritol (PETMP) and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) via C–S–C bonds, superior rate performance and a high capacity retention of 85.6% at 0.5C after 500 cycles can be achieved for Li‖LiFePO4 full cell. Inspired by the previous work on LIB separator modification, porous MOFs have drawn much attention due to their advantages of electrolyte adsorption capacity, ion transport capacity and thermal stability, which have also been applied in LMB full cells. For example, a ZIF-8/polyacrylonitrile (PAN) composite separator was designed for the LiFePO4‖Li full cell, which could improve the full cell capacity in long-term cycling process and provide an ultrahigh coulombic efficiency of almost 100%.90 This study provided prospects for not only LIB separators but also the ones for LMBs, which indicated the potential of MOF-based materials as separators for next generation LMBs with better safety.
The above studies confirmed the possibility of overcoming the inherent defects of lithium anode from electrolytes and separators with MOF additives. Besides, pristine MOFs can be utilized to construct metal anodes with better electrochemical performance based on their inherent merits for Li plating. For example, Zheng et al. reported a novel Li anode with a low volume change, which was fabricated by coating MOF-808 on free-standing hollow carbon fibers (HCF) via electrospinning.91 Thus, the localized Li deposition and more stable SEI film can be guaranteed, resulting in an ultrahigh capacity retention of 93% after 200 cycles for MOF-HCF@Li‖LiFePO4 full cell. Similarly, MOF-808 was applied for nano capsules to release LiNO3 as surface passivation additive in order to build up a stable nitride-rich SEI layer (Fig. 7a).92 Benefitting from the sustained release of LiNO3 from MOF-based nano capsules, small voltage hysteresis and excellent coulombic efficiency can be achieved, resulting in excellent cycling efficiency and stability when applied in Li metal anode for LiCoO2‖Li full cell. As the cycle number increased, the deposition of Li could well maintain despite the growing thickness on the Li metal anodes operating in the LNO@MOF electrolyte (Fig. 7b–d). Based on the ability of MOFs to control adverse reactions, other MOF-coated lithium anodes have also been designed and developed for practical use in LMB full cells. In order to construct an artificial SEI film, Jiang et al. combined the ClO4−-decorated Zr-based MOF (UIO-66-ClO4) and Nafion binder (Li-Nafion) to construct a modified Li anode (denoted as Li@UCLN) for higher stability.93 Based on the “alkali ion pump” function of plasma membranes, UiO-66-ClO4 was rationally designed using the solvent-assisted ligand incorporation (SALI) process (Fig. 7e). As a result, the LMB full cells with the as-prepared Li@UCLN anode coupled with LiFePO4 (LFP) and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM-811), respectively, could deliver a much higher rate capacity and longer cycle life than the ones with a bare Li anode. For the prevention of lithium dendrites, the uniform distribution of lithium plays an important role, which can be achieved by MOF coating. Fang et al. fabricated a composite with a vesicle-shaped hollow ZIF-8 modification shell grown on a 3D carbon cloth (denoted as HZS@CC) and applied as a Li host.94 Owing to the interconnected 3D carbon network provided by the carbon coat substrate and abundant polar groups provided by the ZIF-8 particles, uniform Li deposition can be achieved, leading to a long cycle life of 1200 cycles at a high rate of 6C for the Li@HZS@CC-LiFePO4 cell.

MOF-Derived materials like porous carbon and metal oxides can also be directly applied as Li anodes for dendrite-free LMBs, which is another strategy widely accepted by researchers. Lyu et al. constructed a N-doped carbon framework by 3D-printing Zn-based MOF template (denoted as 3DP-NC) and used it as a Li host for a Li-plated 3DP-NC anode for the full cell with LiFePO4 cathode.95 The as-designed 3DP-NC derived from Zn-MOF exhibited an ultrahigh areal capacity of 30 mA h cm−2 at 10 mA cm−2 due to the high specific surface area provided by the hierarchical porosity structure. Moreover, this 3DP-NC possessed a large area for Li deposition and volume expansion relief, resulting in improved full cell performances including low over potential and high rate capacity. Likewise, a composite with N/O dual-doped 3D porous carbon grown on Cu foam (denoted as NOCA@CF) was designed by the growth of ZIF-8 on Cu foam followed by a calcination step at 700 °C with at a heating rate of 2 °C min−1.96 When investigated as the Li host for Li metal anode, Li@NOCA@CF for LMB full cells with different cathodes including LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, considerable rate capacity and long-term stable electrochemical performance could be obtained. Through the retention of metal elements in the carbon skeleton, lithium phagocytosis can be further improved. A composite with Co-MOF-derived Co,N-co-doped carbon (CN) nanosheet arrays supported by a 3D carbon cloth (denoted as CC@CN–Co) was employed as a lithiophilic framework.97 Better lithiophilicity of CC@CN–Co Li host can be ascribed to the interactions between Li and nitrogen-rich species including pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, and Co–Nx-doped carbon, resulting in superior cycling stability and rate capacity of both CC@CN–Co@Li‖LiFePO4@C and CC@CN–Co@Li‖LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2(NCM) full cells. Inspired by previous research studies, Zhao et al. reported a composite with Co and N embedded in porous carbon nanofibers (PCNF-Co/N) derived from a Co/Zn MOF possessing good lithiophilic properties.98 DFT calculation results indicated that Co/N doping can provide a strong Li–Co/N interaction, which is conducive to enhancement of the Li metal anode stability. As shown in Fig. 7f and g, binding energy of Li atom with PrN, PyN, GrN and N–O is lower in PCNF-Co/N than that in CNF. Moreover, the porous structure retained from the MOF precursor can effectively accommodate the large volume expansion. When assembling the PCNF-Co/N@Li anode with commercial LiFePO4 cathode, lower capacity decay could be achieved, which can be attributed to the formation of a conductive SEI film and alleviation of lithium dendrite growth.
Other than MOF-derived carbon materials, metal oxides derived from MOF precursors can work as lithophilic active sites to adjust the growth of Li dendrites. A Li metal anode with Co3O4 embedded in N-doped carbon (CFC/Co–NC@Li) was constructed by the in situ growth of ZIF-67 on commercial carbon fiber cloth followed by calcination and molten infusion steps.99 The as-fabricated anode displayed low overpotential and long cycle life for CFC/Co–NC@Li‖LiFePO4 full cell, which can be attributed to the high specific surface area and mechanical strength. Similarly, Zhang et al. synthesized Al2O3 loaded mesoporous carbon (Al2O3@MOF-C) using Al(OH)(1,4-NDC)·2H2O as the precursor and employed it as the Li host for better Li deposition and utilization.100 Consequently, the Al2O3@MOF-C@Li‖LiFePO4 full cell displayed a high initial capacity of 138.8 mA h g−1 and an excellent capacity retention of 91% after 200 cycles, which can be ascribed to Al2O3 nano-seeds serving for the lithiophilic process. CuO nanorod arrays derived from Cu-TCNQ were also grown on Cu foil to construct a Li metal anode with lithiophilic groups, namely Li–CuO NAs/CF.101 As a result, the full cell with Li–CuO NAs/CF anode and LiFePO4 cathode displayed remarkable stability with low polarization. These results indicated that metal oxides are promising candidates that offer stable, dendrite-free LMB full cells.
When employed as the cell components in LMB full cells, the main focus is the higher lithiophilicity for less Li dendrite growth. First, pristine MOFs are promising candidates for the fillers of electrolytes to enhance the ion conductivity and the stability of the interface between electrodes and the electrolytes by chemical interactions. Second, when employed as the surficial modifiers of the separators, MOFs can not only achieve chemical absorption of the active substances for alleviation of the crossover effect, but also maintain considerable ion conductivity due to their porosity. Thirdly, MOF derivatives are ideal lithiophilic materials in Li anodes due to the existence of the lithiophilic species like N-rich species and metal oxides that can effectively prohibit the Li dendrite growth by physical and chemical effects.
3.3 Other lithium batteries
Li anode is also required for lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs), which are a class of secondary batteries working via lithium oxidation and sulfur reduction. Due to the similar working mechanism of Li metal in LSB full cells to the ones mentioned above for LMB systems, the strategies of the lithiophilic process are also feasible when coupled with a sulfur cathode. Therefore, MOF-based materials including pristine MOFs and their derivatives can also be applied as Li host for LSBs with sulfur as the cathode. For example, the above reported Li@UCLN,93 CFC/Co–NC@Li99 and Al2O3@MOF-C@Li100 anodes have been assembled with S cathode for LSB full cell applications. By choosing a feasible Li host, higher rate capacity and better cycling performance can be obtained due to the consumption of Li dendrites and “dead Li”.
The dissolution and shuttle effect of polysulfides is another important factor that causes the capacity decline of lithium–sulfur batteries. Therefore, encapsulation of sulfur species by physical and chemical methods is an effective measure to improve stability and coulombic efficiency. Lin et al. used a double layer photonic crystal (DLPC) with a 3D ordered interconnected structure derived from ZIF-8 to confine both the sulfur cathode and the lithium anode to construct a high-performance LSB full cell.102 Notably, this DLPC-confining strategy can not only effectively enhance the conductivity and prevent shuttle effect by chemical interactions, but also reduce Li dendrite growth due to a high specific surface area. Impressively, the DLPC@S/DLPC@Li full cell delivered a high capacity of 703.3 mA h g−1 at even 10C and an ultralow decay of less than 40% at 0.5C after 1200 cycles. For higher sulfur utilization, Sung et al. designed an interlayer in combination of Co-MOF-74 and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to promote the conversion of Li2S2 to Li2S.103 When employing Co-MOF-74@MWCNT as an interlayer for LSB full cell, much higher capacity than the one with bare MWCNT can be obtained.
In addition to LSBs, lithium–oxygen batteries (LOBs) are another class of lithium batteries with a high theoretical energy density, and have been considered to be good candidates to adapt to the growing energy market. For one thing, low overpotential and polarization degree are the key factors to improve the LOB cell cycle life, which can be accommodated by the rational design of electrolytes. A single-ion electrolyte with Cu-MOF-74 was employed in the Li–O2 cell with Li anode and KB cathode.87 Owing to the catalytic activity of MOF-74 for Li peroxide, lower overpotential and polarization can be achieved, resulting in lower capacity decay than the one with G4 electrolyte. For another thing, the catalytic capability of air cathode can make great difference to the capacity of LOB cells. In order to utilize the bimetal active sites, Chatterjee et al. synthesized a bifunctional electrocatalytic cathode with nitrogen-doped carbon wrapping on manganese oxide/cobalt manganite MnO/CoMn2O4@N–C by the carbonization of α-MnO2@ZIF-67 composite.104 Benefitting from the good synergy of Co and Mn as well as the conductive N–C shell with a high specific surface area provided by core@shell structural features, the LOB cell with the MnO/CoMn2O4@N–C cathode and Li anode displayed an ultrahigh specific capacity of 8625 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1.
These results revealed more possibilities for the applications of MOF-based materials in lithium batteries. For LSBs, the dissolution of the polysulfides and the Li dendrite growth are fatal weakness for commercialization on a large scale, which can be well addressed by using MOF-based materials as S hosts or Li hosts. Additionally, the promotion of the conversion from polysulfides to Li2S is another effective way to improve the utilization of sulfur species. For LOBs, the consumption of Li peroxide and the electrocatalysis in the cathode are main factors for the full cell performances. These issues can be well accommodated by MOF-based materials due to their abundant catalytic sites.
4. Sodium batteries
Sodium batteries are another class of secondary batteries, which can achieve charge transfer through sodium valence conversion with similar working mechanism to that of lithium batteries. Based on the abundant sources of Na, sodium batteries have been considered to be alternatives to address the shortcomings of Li including scarcity of natural sources and high cost. According to the redox processes, sodium batteries can be divided into two main categories including sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and sodium metal batteries (SMBs). As discussed, MOF-based materials have been confirmed to be good candidates for lithium storage, thus were reported to be feasible for sodium storage also, which can be achieved by the reversible transfer of Na species.
4.1 Sodium-ion batteries
Owing to the similar working mechanism to LIBs, many LIB electrode materials like porous carbon, metal sulfides and metal selenides are also applied for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) to enhance the sodium storage capacity. Similar to the LIB anodes, most reported MOF-based SIB anodes operate via the intercalation and conversion mechanisms, whose electrochemical properties in SIB full cells are summarized in Table 4. Liu et al. synthesized rhombic dodecahedral N-doped carbon using ZIF-8 as the precursor and assembled it with Prussian blue cathode for high-performance SIB full cell.105 As expected, the full cell delivered considerable reversible capacity and could serve as a power source for LED light. Similarly, S-doped carbon with three-dimension structure (3DSC-700) was prepared by the calcination of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF-8/ZIF-67) and thiophene (Th) at 700 °C under Ar atmosphere.106 When applied in the full cell system with sodium vanadium phosphate (NVP) cathode, a good cycling stability in 50 cycles can be obtained with a high capacity of around 229.64 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and showed blue LED light. The above studies indicated that porous carbon derived from MOFs are promising Na storage materials with great potential for practical use.

As enriched redox active substances, metal oxides can realize sodium storage by the valence shift of metal centers, which is beneficial to the enhancement of capacity when combining with porous architectures inherited from MOF precursors. In order to achieve the combination of porous carbon and metal oxides, Kong et al. fabricated nanomaterials with vanadium oxides embedded in porous carbon nanorods (denoted as VOx/PCs) with 2D pores retained from a V-MOF with 1,4-naphthalene dicarboxylates (95% Macklin), and 1,4-benzenedicarboxylates as the organic ligands.107 Owing to the special hierarchical porous structure capacitive behaviors, the full cell with the VOx/PC anode and Na3V2(PO4)3/C (NVP) cathode displayed a large expansive voltage range, remarkable energy density and long cycle life. However, the metal oxide-based electrodes have high working voltages and are difficult to match with the diffusion control cathodes, which hinder their further applications in SIB full cells.
Transition metal sulfides are conducive to high capacity due to their conversion reactions when working as the anode materials, which have drawn much attention in sodium storage. In 2017, Zhou et al. reported a composite anode with CoS nanoparticles (∼7 nm) embedded in porous carbon nanorods (denoted as 7-CoS/C) by carbonization and sulfurization of Co-MOF with 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid and 4,4′-bipyridine as ligands.108 Benefitting from the rational design of advantageous hybrid nanostructure, 7-CoS/C delivered superior rate capacity and cycling stability when investigated in Na3V2(PO4)3/7-CoS/C full cell. As is known, nano coating is beneficial to shorten the ion diffusion distance, and combination of multiple active substances is conducive to the improvement of overall electrochemical activity. To utilize the redox activity of various metal sulfides, Shi et al. constructed a composite with SnS2 nanosheets wrapping on CoS2/C with a nanohollow cubic architecture via a facile controllable synthetic route using Co–Co Prussian blue analogue as the precursor.109 Remarkably, a reversible capacity of 567.3 mA h g−1 can be obtained in CoS2/C@SnS2-NVP full cell after 1000 cycles at a high current density of 1000 mA g−1.
In addition to CoS, Co9S8 has also been applied as a sodium storage material due to its considerable theoretical capacity. During the sodiation/desodiation process, mechanical stability and accommodation of large volume change are vital for longer cycle life of cobalt sulfide-based anodes. For facilitating cyclic stability, Huang et al. reported a SIB anode with Co9S8 nanoflakes on a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheet synthesized via thermal treatment of composite with ZIF-67 grown on rGO at 600 °C under Ar atmosphere.110 The rGO/Co9S8 composite displayed good structural flexibility and capacitive effect, resulting in good potential for practical application in full cell system with conventional Na3V2(PO4)3. In order to obtain better contribution for total sodium storage capacity, taking advantage of various active materials coupled with Co9S8-based materials is also a reasonable strategy. Coating of Co9S8 embedded N-doped carbon composite layer on Bi2S3 spheres resulted in the combination of two active materials that could contribute to higher specific capacity, while the inherent demerits of low conductivity and severe volume expansion of Bi2S3 could be well addressed.111 Consequently, the full cell assembled with Na3V2(PO4)3/rGO cathode and Bi2S3@Co9S8/NC exhibited an energy density of 507.5 W h kg−1 and a good capacity retention of 87.6% after 100 cycles at 0.2 A g−1, demonstrating the great potential of Bi2S3@Co9S8/NC as advanced SIB anode.
The expense and toxicity of Co are the biggest obstacles for the practical applications of cobalt sulfides; therefore, some variable metals with low cost and good environmental friendliness such as Fe have been taken into consideration. Fan et al. designed a agaric-like Fe1−xS@NC composite with Fe1−xS nanosheet coated by N-doped carbon via calcination of Fe-MOF precursor followed by the sulfurization step with thioacetamide as S sources.112 The SIB full cell with Fe1−xS@NC as the anode and Na3V2(PO4)2O2F (NVPOF) as the cathode delivered a high capacity of 183.6 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at a high current density of 700 mA g−1 in a voltage window of 0.3–3.8 V, which can be ascribed to the redox activity of iron sulfides and carbon layer with good conductivity and small mechanical deformation. By importing other metal sulfides and construction of a core–shell structure, iron sulfide-based anode can exhibit even more fascinating electrochemical performance. Recently, Cao et al. constructed an okra-like bimetal sulfide Fe7S8/C@ZnS/N–C@C using a MOF-on-MOF template MIL-53@ZIF-8@RF (RF = resorcinol–formaldehyde) synthesized using the layer-by-layer assembly method (Fig. 8a).113 This composite can not only alleviate the volume change to enhance the cycling stability but also achieve higher capacity through stepwise sodiation/desodiation reactions of Fe7S8 and ZnS. As a result a high initial coulombic efficiency of 72.8% and a capacity of 357.8 mA h g−1 can be obtained when coupled with the Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode for full cell test at 0.05 A g−1 in the voltage window of 0.01–3.7 V. These results demonstrated the feasibility of metal sulfides for SIB anode in full cell systems, providing theoretical basis for material morphology control.

Based on a similar conversion mechanism to that of metal sulfides during sodiation, metal selenides have also been investigated as promising SIB anodes due to high conductivity and theoretical capacity. The metal properties of selenium are conducive to the improvement of electrochemical activity, so the specific capacity of metal selenides is superior to the corresponding oxides or sulfides in general.84 In 2018, Hou et al. reported a composite with Ni1.8Co1.2Se4 nanoparticles encapsulated in N-doped carbon derived from a Ni–Co bimetallic MOF Ni3[Co(CN)6]2·6H2O.114 Impressively, the as-prepared anode exhibited superior SIB full cell performance when coupled with Na3V2(PO4)2O2F cathode even under harsh working conditions. According to the structural characterization results (Fig. 8b and c), the NCS@NDDC anode could deliver excellent cycling stability due to the stable carbon shell without fracture and peeling despite the internal collapse. Later on, a hierarchical mesoporous material with CoSe/N-doped carbon (N–C) coating on MoSe2 was prepared by selenization of the MoO3@Co-MOF precursor.115 A high reversible capacity of 345 mA h g−1 can be obtained in the full cell with the Na3V2(PO4)3/C cathode, which can be ascribed to the structural stability and good synergy between CoSe and MoSe2. Similarly, Fang et al. reported another bimetallic selenide CoSe2/ZnSe with abundant phase boundaries.116 As expected, CoSe2/ZnSe displayed good Na absorption capacity and superior full cell performance when coupled with the Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode.
Additionally, other metal compounds like transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have been also regarded as promising energy storage materials due to their ultrahigh theoretical capacity. However, the inherent disadvantages of low conductivity and large volume expansion limit their practical use, which is similar to the metal sulfides. In order to well accommodate the above limitations, Shi et al. rationally designed a P-doped 3D octahedral carbon framework confined FeP quantum dots (FeP@OCF) by in situ carbonization and phosphorization of MIL-101@CNTs precursor to achieve smaller particle radius and higher electrical conductivity.117 The as-fabricated FeP@OCF delivered excellent rate capacity at different current densities when assembled with the Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode for SIB full cell (Fig. 8d and e). These results highlighted more possibility for applications of MOF-based materials in SIB full cells, which indicated the feasibility of MOF-template method to break through the inherent demerits of metal compounds.
Generally, the porous carbon materials operate with an intercalation mechanism for Na+ insertion, while most of the MOF derivatives like metal oxides, metal sulfides, metal selenides and metal phosphides achieve Na storage via a conversion mechanism by redox reactions of the metal ions. In the synthetic process of the MOF-derived carbon, the decomposition of the organic ligands can provide an ultra-high specific surface area due to the retention of the tunable porous structure. For MOF-derived metal compounds, the high density, good distribution and the strong synergistic effect of the metal redox centers can greatly improve the theoretical capacity in SIB full cells. Moreover, the combination of carbon matrix and metal active sites can well address the inherently low electronic conductivity of the metal compounds.
4.2 Sodium metal batteries
Similar to the LMBs, sodium metal batteries (SMBs) also face the problem of dendrite growth which causes poor safety and stability as well as low coulombic efficiency. Therefore, a rationally designed MOF-derived Na metal anode host can effectively address the above problem for better SMB full cell performance. Based on the abundant sodiophilic sites in MOF-based materials, the uniform growth and nucleation of sodium metal can be achieved. Among the as-prepared MOF derivatives, porous carbon materials have been regarded as great candidates for practical use in SMBs due to their porosity and uniformly distributed active sites. For instance, Mubarak et al. synthesized porous carbon nanofiber (PCNF) films via carbonization of bimetallic ZnNi-MOF prepared by facile room temperature reaction and employed as a sodiophilic host.118 According to the DFT calculation results, nitrogen and oxygen functional groups reduce the adsorption energy for Na, which is conducive to the uniform growth of metallic Na. As expected, the full cell assembled with the Na/C anode and the Na3V2(PO4)3(NVP) cathode delivered considerable cycle life and coulombic efficiency of over 98%, shedding lights on the practical applications of dendrite-free Na hosts. Likewise, Xie et al. designed a porous N-doped carbon with rhombic dodecahedron embedded with Co nanoparticles using ZIF-67 as the precursor via facile carbonization step in N2 flow.119 The DFT calculations illustrated the good synergy of Co and N sites with increased sodiophilicity, which is conducive to higher Na storage capability. Moreover, the uniform charge distribution increases the sodiophilicity by uniform electrodeposition, resulting in high capacity and cycling stability of the full cell paired with the Na3V2(PO4)2F3(NVPF) cathode.
Compared with Li, Na even behaves more actively and leads to serious Na dendrite growth, which is a main limitation for SMBs and needs an urgent solution. The MOF-derived porous carbon with abundant sodiophilic sites can effectively achieve the uniform growth of the metallic Na to enhance the capacity retention and cycling life of the SMB full cells. Due to the high sodiophilicity of the N-rich functional groups, N-rich organic ligands ought to be taken into consideration, which can provide uniformly distributed sodiophilic species embedded in the carbon matrix with ultra-high porosity by decomposition and reduce the Na dendrite growth by both physical and chemical approaches.
5. Aqueous batteries
Currently, alkaline metal batteries are the most widely used category of energy storage and conversion equipment, in particular lithium ion batteries, which meet most of the energy requirement for industries. However, due to the active chemical nature of alkali metals and flammable nature of organic electrolytes, alkaline metal batteries still face safety related issues. For higher safety and development of new energy sources, aqueous batteries have been widely considered due to their good safety, conductivity and low cost.120 To adapt to different operating conditions, MOF-based materials have been designed for alkaline, acidic and neutral media, which can be ascribed to the easy control of composition and morphology. Improvement of the energy supplying efficiency and cycling durability has been achieved by the rational design of MOF-based electrodes under various aqueous circumstances and operando conditions, and is compared and summarized in Table 5.

For increasing demands of energy requirements, alkaline batteries have been considered as good candidates to replace traditional LIBs due to better safety, environmental friendliness and mitigation of resource crisis. The guarantee of ion conductivity and active sites is of significance for modification of alkaline full cells, which can be well accommodated by MOF-based materials. For example, Li et al. designed MOF-derived Ag nanowires on carbon cloth as the cathode for Ag–Zn full cell with KOH as the electrolyte.121 Owing to the abundant active sites and short ion transmission paths provided by Ag nanowires, the as-assembled full cell delivered a high energy density of 1.87 mW h cm−2. This result indicated that electrodes with nanostructures are beneficial to improve electrochemical activity kinetics. Inspired by this, MOF-based materials have also been employed as the cathode for other Zn-based aqueous full cells. Chen et al. proposed a one-step etching-deposition-growth process started with Co-MOF to prepare a Ni–Zn battery cathode with nickel–cobalt double hydroxide (NiCo-DH) grown on a Ni substrate (Fig. 9a).122 The further structural characterization (Fig. 9d and e) depicted the well retention of sheet-like arrays in this process. The NiCo-DH possessed a unique 3D hierarchical structure which is conducive to ion and electron transfer as well as active material exposure and easy electrolyte access, resulting in considerable electrochemical performances (Fig. 9b). More importantly, the NiCo-DH‖Zn full cell displayed excellent rate capacity and long cycle life.

The above reports about alkaline Zn batteries have shed lights on the applications of MOF-based electrodes for other batteries with alkaline electrolytes. For easy shuttle of potassium ions and hydroxide ions, Li et al. reported a bimetallic NiCo-MOF with 2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylate as the ligand and employed it as the cathode in an alkaline full cell with the poly(anthraquinonyl sulfide) (PAQS) anode.123 Compared with NiCo-DH, higher full cell capacity of 280 mA h g−1 and longer cycle life can be obtained due to the abundant Ni/Co redox active sites and large space provided by the MOF-based cathode. For better synergy between different metal centers, a composite with Ni–Mo–Co–S nanocage arrays grown on Ni foam (denoted as Ni–Mo–Co–S NCAs/NF) was synthesized via the in situ growth of ZIF-67 on NiMoO4·xH2O nanorod arrays followed by a facile sulfidation process.124 As expected, different components of the Ni–Mo–Co–S NCAs/NF cathode including NiS, MoS2 and CoSX participated in the reactions with OH−. Moreover, the yolk–shell structure can provide abundant contacting areas for electrolyte, uniformly distributed active sites, good structural stability as well as proper paths for ions and electrons. As a result, Ni–Mo–Co–S NCAs/NF-Bi2O3 exhibited great potential for particle use in both energy and power density.
In addition to functioning as electrode active substances, MOF-based materials also show great potential for highly active electrocatalysts in full cell systems with oxygen participation because of their outstanding catalytic activity provided by the metal centers. To our best knowledge, pristine MOFs can provide functional species with metal ions and organic moieties, particularly variable metal ions; hence they are suitable candidates as electrocatalysts for alkaline full cells. To investigate the impacts of molar ratio of Co and Fe for catalytic performance, a series of bimetallic MOFs with NH2-BDC as the precursor including Co-MOF, Co4Fe-MOF, Co3Fe-MOF, Co2Fe-MOF and Fe-MOF were synthesized.125 Among the as-prepared MOFs, Co3Fe-MOF delivered the superior performances for both oxygen emission reaction (OER) and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), which can be attributed to the stable elemental distribution and good synergy between Co and Fe based on the reaction: M2+ + 3OH− → MeOOH + e− (M = Fe or Co). As shown in Fig. 9c, Co and Fe atoms are octahedrally coordinated separated by the NH2-BDC ligands. This encouraging result indicated the potential of Co3Fe-MOF as high-performance electrocatalysts in an aqueous full-cell configuration with KOH as the electrolyte.
In addition to alkaline media, MOF-based materials also function well in acidic or neutral media due to the high redox activity, large specific surface area and abundant active sites or functional groups. In 2020, Zhang et al. attempted to synthesize a composite with bismuth metal nanoparticles embedded in carbon matrix using Bi-BTB MOF (H3BTB = 1,3,5-benzenetrisbenzoic acid) as the precursor by thermal treatment under a reducing atmosphere.120 When employed as the anode for the Bi/AgCl battery system with 1 M NaCl (pH = 2) as the electrolyte, stable specific capacity and high coulombic efficiency of approximately 99% can be obtained, which can be ascribed to the well-designed nano-texture architecture with excellent electrochemical reversibility. This work provided important guidance for the design of electrodes for aqueous chloride ion full cells. Based on the similar working mechanisms to alkaline Zn batteries, some MOF-based materials are also feasible for the ones with neutral electrolytes. For example, An et al. fabricated N,O-co-doped carbon on Cu foam (NOCA@CF) derived from ZIF-8 as the Zn host to achieve uniform deposition to prevent Zn dendrite growth.96 This carbon coating strategies reduced the occurrence of side reactions and achieved higher efficiency, resulting in an impressive capacity of 82.4 mA h g−1 in Zn@NOCA@CF‖LiMn2O4 full cell. Similarly, a MOF-coating method with Cu3(BTC)2 was proposed to separate zinc anode and aqueous electrolyte.126 Consequently, Zn dendrite growth and water spitting were successfully addressed, resulting in a high energy density of 210 W h kg−1 and low capacity decay for Zn‖MnO2 full cell. As shown in Fig. 9f, Zn‖MnO2 full cell modified by Cu3(BTC)2 delivered a much higher cycling life than the ordinary one. These innovative results well adapted to the needs of aqueous full battery systems under different working conditions.
Under different operando conditions and media in the aqueous full cell systems, MOF-based materials are adjustable for adaptation of the complex parameters. The abundant metal redox active sites in the MOF-based materials can contribute to superior power density and energy supply efficiency. In alkaline aqueous full cells, the transition metal ions are conducive to the faster kinetics for electron transfer due to the interaction with OH−, thus MOF-based materials are feasible electrocatalysts in alkaline media. However, the transition metal with poor acid tolerance restricted their application in the acidic media, thus MOFs containing less active metal centers need to be considered. Moreover, the controllable pore structure can provide opportunities for the uniform growth of metals like Zn, which enhances the electrochemical efficiency and cycling life of the Zn-based aqueous full cells.
6. Advanced fuel cells
Fuel cells have been considered to be promising devices for energy storage and conversion due to their sustained clean products and remarkable power density, which still require improvement in terms of the electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).127 In the fuel cell systems, the durability and catalytic activity of the electrocatalysts are crucial for their practical use. Despite the low overpotential of the precious metal catalysts, the high cost and scarcity still restrict their commercialization. Therefore, the exploration and development of nanomaterials with abundant metal active sites is of significance for the future development of the fuel cells, among which the single-atom catalysts (SACs) have been widely considered due to their outstanding atom utilization and good dispersion of the metal active sites.128 According to the results of in-depth characterization and theoretical studies, M–Nx species in SACs play an important role in the ORR/OER reactions in fuel cell systems like H2/O2 fuel cells.129 Among various synthetic methods of SACs, MOF-template methods have been considered as a promising way to achieve controllable synthesis by pyrolysis of the precursors. Due to the porous architecture being retained form the self-sacrificing templates, MOF-derived SACs and other nanocomposites possess the improved utilization and good dispersion of the active sites while employed as electrocatalysts.130 Consequently, the MOF-based electrocatalysts for fuel cells show potential for enhancement of the working durability and the substitution of the conventional precious metal catalysts, which are listed in Table 6.

6.1 H2/O2 fuel cells
Owing to the environmental friendliness and enticing energy density, the development of H2/O2 fuel cells has been an emerging field for decades. Nevertheless, the practical applications still face the disadvantage of slow kinetics for ORR in the cathode, thus the exploration for an efficient ORR catalysts is vital for their future commercialization.131 In order to overcome the above challenges, numerous efforts have been devoted to the studies on SACs for higher atomic utilization and better durability. Besides, taking the excellent catalytic activity of transition metals into account, MOF-derived nanomaterials have also been considered as promising alternatives for high-cost Pt.
The theoretical studies have confirmed that M–Nx is the main catalytically active species for ORR. Considering the low cost and considerable catalytic activity of Fe, a facile synthetic method by pyrolysis of the Fe-doped ZIF-8 to obtain a Fe–N–C electrocatalyst for proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) was proposed.132 As expected, the atomically dispersed Fe–N4 can act as the active moiety for the high-performance acidic PEMFC. Morphology control is vital for the atom distribution of the targeted products, thus using MOFs as the sacrificing templates has been widely accepted in the design of M–N–C catalysts. By pyrolysis of ZIF-8/Fe@PZS (PZS = poly(cyclo-triphospazene-co-4,4′-sulfonyldiphenol)) at 900 °C in Ar, single Fe atomic sites on the N,P,S-codoped hollow carbon polyhedron (denoted as Fe-SAs/NPS-HC) were successfully constructed (Fig. 10a).133 As shown in Fig. 10b–d, Fe-SAs/NPS-HC retained the uniform polyhedral morphology with a hollow structure. The electronic control effect provided by heteroatoms and the automatically distributed Fe are favorable for ORR in terms of thermodynamics and kinetics, resulting in a catalytic activity comparable with that of the Pt/C based catalysts. To our best knowledge, ZIF-8 can serve as a nitrogen source and a morphology controlling agent by the decomposition of the organic ligand and the sublimation of Zn. Therefore, ZIF-8 has been used as the template for synthesis of Fe-based SACs. For acceleration of the formation of Fe–N4 to achieve higher catalytic performance, g-C3N4 was mixed with hollow Fe-ZIF-8 (FeHZ8) followed by calcination at 950 °C to fabricate Fe-doped hollow carbon (denoted as C-FeHZ8@g-C3N4-950).134 Benefitting from the gas etching caused by the decomposition of g-C3N4, C-FeHZ8@g-C3N4-950 displayed a hollow porous architecture conducive to the uniform dispersion of the Fe atoms. More impressively, the as-designed SAC exhibited a maximum power density of 628 mW cm−2, which is an ultra-high performance among the Pt-free electrocatalysts. Similarly, Qiao et al. successfully synthesized a FeN4-doped hierarchical ordered porous carbon (FeN4/HOPC-c-1000) skeleton by the carbonization of bimetallic MOF Fe-ZIF-8 at 1000 °C.135 FeN4/HOPC-c-1000 displayed a current density of 0.69 A cm−2 at 0.6 V much higher than the ordinary FeN4/C of 0.5 A cm−2 and a power density of 0.42 W cm−2 at 0.57 V (0.35 W cm−2 for FeN4/C). Moreover, the catalyst showed impressive durability at 0.55 V and 0.7 V. These results revealed that an optimized annealing temperature and order porous structure are conducive to the atomically dispersed FeN4 catalytic centers. In pursuit of a higher surface area, a binary ligand strategy combing 2-methylimidazole (mIm) and 2-undecylimidazole (uIm) was also reported.136 This work provided more approaches for the controllable preparation of Fe–N–C type electrocatalysts.

In addition to Fe, other transition metal based catalysts have also been applied in the H2/O2 fuel cells due to their desirable ORR catalytic activity and higher stability. In order to address the Fenton reactions (Fe2+ + H2O2) of the Fe–N–C catalysts, a Mn-N–C type SAC with atomically dispersed MnN4 species was synthesized by the calcination of Mn-doped ZIF-8 precursor followed by the acid leaching step.137 By adjusting the ratio of Mn and Zn, optimized performances were obtained at a Mn content of 20% (denoted as 20Mn-NC) with 1000 hour life at a relatively high voltage of 0.7 V. Cobalt is another variable metal element showing enticing electrocatalytic performance; thus Co–N–C type SACs have also been considered as Fe-free catalysts for H2/O2 fuel cells. A similar strategy of calcining the Co-doped ZIF-8 was also applied for the synthesis of the Co–N–C catalyst, resulting in PEMFC performances comparable to the Fe–N–C catalysts due to well-dispersed CoN4 active sites provided by the MOF template.138 Despite the promising catalytic activity of the Co–N–C catalysts, the agglomeration of the Co atomic sites may lead to severe attenuation of its practical use. For confinement of the Co aggregates and the collapse of the porous structure in the ZIF-8 precursor, Pluronic F127 block copolymer was employed as the surfactant for the fabrication of an atomically dispersed Co–N–C@F127 catalyst.139 According to the results of density functional theory calculations, the well-dispersed CoN2+2 active sites could effectively catalyze the 4e− ORR process due to the relatively lower activation energy of 0.69 eV than the one of CoN4. However, the performance loss under high operating voltages is still a challenge that needs to be addressed by carrying out more in-depth studies.
Based on the findings of single site M–N–C as electrocatalysts in H2/O2 fuel cells, tremendous efforts have been devoted in pursuit of the combination between different active metal centers. For instance, Wang et al. synthesized a Pt-free catalysts with Fe and Co automatically dispersed in the N-doped carbon matrix.140 Inspiringly, the dual metal sites contributed to the activation of the O–O bonds and the 4e− ORR process, which was well reflected in the H2/O2 and H2/air fuel cell tests. The excellent durability in the fuel cell test indicated the stability of the dual metal sites and the potential for practical production. To further explore the interactions between various metal sites in the electrocatalysts, Yang et al. designed a series of SACs with single and multiple active sites (Fe, Co, Ni).141 In spite of the multiple metal sites, the multiple metallic catalysts still suffered from severe decay of current density and open circuit voltage, which required improvement in the ratio of different metal sites and structural engineering. To prevent the metal aggregation and provide more hierarchical pores, liquid SiO2 was added to the reacting system with ZIF-8, FePc and NiPc (Pc = phthalocyanine).142 Consequently, FeNi–N6 with metal atoms coordinated with 4 N atoms delivered lower H2O2 yield and a direct 4e− catalytic process, which could effectively enhance the catalytic activity and the operating life. Fe acted as the dominant active sites, while Ni enhanced the cycling stability of the catalyst, which revealed the importance of the configuration of the active sites in electrocatalysis.
Considering the complexity of the requirements in the M–N–C type electrocatalyst design, metal nanocomposites have also been investigated as ORR catalysts due to their abundant active sites. For example, a composite with Fe–Fe3C embedded in Fe–N–C was prepared by the calcination of a mixed MOF MIL-100/ZIF-8 at 1000 °C.143 Fe and N were atomically incorporated to form abundant catalytic centers, which promoted *OH desorption for enhanced ORR catalytic kinetics. Moreover, the Fe–FeC3 not only accelerated the graphitized carbon for better exposure of the FeN4 active sites and the higher charge conductivity, but also enhanced oxygen affinity. Owing to the synergistic effect of Fe and FeC3, this composed catalyst delivered remarkable performances comparable to that of the Pt/C catalysts. This result well demonstrated the potential of metal nanocomposites serving as the ORR catalysts in the fuel cells, paving the way for future development of Pt-free electrocatalysts.
The sluggish ORR process drastically tapers the reaction kinetics of the H2/O2 fuel cells, thus efficient catalysts are urgently required for their further development. First, owing to considerable catalytic activity of the M–Nx species for ORR, N-containing ligands like 2-methylimidazole and the variable metal like Fe, Co and Mn need to be considered in the design of MOF-based catalysts. Second, morphology control is another factor for the overall performance, because the good dispersion of the metal centers can effectively make full use of the atoms. Thirdly, utilization of the synergistic effect between different active sites is a promising strategy to strive for superior catalytic capacity. However, the above conditions are difficult to be met at the same time; thus there is still a great challenge for the exploration of ideal catalysts for H2/O2 fuel cells.
6.2 Organic fuel cells
Pt-Free electrocatalysts have been widely concerned in the H2/O2 fuel cells due to their M–Nx active sites accelerating the ORR process, which are also feasible in the electrocatalysis for organic fuel cells. Similar to the H2/O2 fuel cells, organic fuel cells can achieve the conversion of chemical energy to electrical and thermal energy by the oxidation of organic fuel, which also involves the ORR procedure. For example, methanol is a general organic fuel used in high energy density fuel cells. For practical use of the cathodes in the direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs), the design of ORR catalysts with desirable methanol tolerance and durability in acidic electrolytes is of significance.144 For better adaptation under the acidic atmosphere, metal-free catalysts have been regarded as a good candidate for eletrocatalysis in DMFCs. A graphene-based nitrogen-doped porous carbon material with a 2D sandwich-like architecture (GNPCSs-800) was prepared by the in situ growth of ZIF-8 on graphene oxide (GO) followed by thermal treatment at 800 °C.145 This catalyst delivered a higher current density and open circuit voltage than conventional Pt/C as well as considerable durability due to its excellent methanol tolerance, which could be ascribed to the synergistic effect between the graphene and the N-doped porous carbon.
Based on the excellent tolerance for organic media of the carbon materials, they have also been employed as catalysts in other fuel cells. Considering the poor stability of metallic catalysts in acidic electrolytes, Jahan et al. designed a composite assembled with Cu-based MOF and GO, which simultaneously made use of the excellent catalytic activity of the Cu centers for ORR/OER as well as the encapsulating function and high conductivity provided by the GO.146 As a result, the MOF composite catalyst delivered a comparable power density to that of the commercial Pt-based catalysts in the polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell measurement. A bamboo-like carbon nanotube network with Fe centered active sites was designed with NH2-MIL-88B as the iron source and ZIF-8 as the carbon source.147 When investigated as a nonprecious metal catalyst for the polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell, excellent oxygen reduction activity could be obtained in both half-cell and full-cell systems due to the uniform distribution of catalytic active sites, high conductivity and a large surface area.
The above principles of catalyst design are also feasible in other organic fuel cells in pursuit of faster ORR kinetics and longer cycling life. Striving for better protection of the active sites and higher catalytic activity, Xu et al. reported a N-doped carbon capsule (NCC) derived from ZIF-8 for the encapsulation of PtCu nanoparticles (NPs) to enhance catalytic efficiency of formic acid oxidation.148 The as-prepared PtCu@NCC anodic catalysts delivered operating stability in both half-cell and full-cell devices for direct formic acid fuel cell (DFAFC) due to good kinetics provided by the rationally designed architecture. As exhibited in Fig. 10e and f, the PtCu@NCC-based DFAFC displayed a much higher maximum power density of 121 mW cm−2 and much lower maximum power density loss of 29.3% than the Pt/C-based one. Other than carbon encapsulation, the higher density of active sites is vital for the power generation of fuel cells. By carbonization of the Cu-bipy-BTC (bipy = 2,2′-bipyridine, BTC = 1,3,5-tricarboxylate) at 800 °C, abundant active sites including C–N and Cu–Nx as well as the high porosity were obtained in the final product (denoted as MOF-800).149 Consequently, MOF-800 exhibited a much higher peak power density than the corresponding MOF, which is comparable to Pt/C as an air cathode for microbial fuel cell (MFC).
For organic fuel cells, the tolerance for organic substance and acidic media ought to be considered in the design of MOF-based electrocatalysts, which can effectively enhance the cycling durability under various conditions. In order to protect the metal active sites, application of less active metal like Cu, development of metal-free catalysts with heteroatoms as active sites and carbon encapsulation are feasible in the acidic environment. These results offered essential insights for the exploration of relationship between structure, composite and electrochemical performance, demonstrating more possibility of particle use of MOF-based materials for high-performance fuel cell systems.
7. Other full cell applications
To solve the energy crisis that is going to occur in the near future, exploration of new devices for energy storage and conversion is a basic challenge in the fields of materials chemistry and electrochemistry. Most of the new batteries reported by researchers still face some obstacles like poor performances and unstable energy output, which are in need of some effective solutions to expand their practical applications. Therefore, some researchers have made attempts to utilize the merits of the MOF-based materials like a large specific surface area and abundant active sites for the enhancement of operating performances for corresponding full-cell configuration.
As is known, lithium-ion batteries are the most commonly used rechargeable batteries for portable devices and electric vehicles, which have problems of metal resource shortage and high cost. Based on the similar working mechanisms, potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) have been considered to be good alternatives to LIBs and SIBs due to their high working voltages and electrolyte conversion rates.150 However, the large diameter of K+ and safety hazards caused by potassium dendrites require consideration during the design of electrodes for PIB full cell. To address the above demerits, Ma et al. proposed a two-step self-sacrificial method to synthesize Co0.85Se nanoparticles in N-doped carbon (Co0.85Se@NC) with a ZIF-67 template (Fig. 11a).151 Benefitting from the mesoporous structure with a short K+ transfer distance and a large contact area between electrolyte and electrode, the Co0.85Se@NC exhibited excellent performances for both half-cell and full-cell tests. Notably, when assembled with the K0.5MnO2 cathode, a high capacity of 99.4 mA h g−1 at a current density of 50 mA g−1 after 20 cycles can be obtained, shedding lights on applications of MOF-derived chalcogenides in PIB full cell system.

(b) Scheme of the structure characterization and (c) oxygen and hydrogen evolution rates in the Zn–air full cell driven overall water splitting device.154 Copyright © 2019, Elsevier B.V. 
Other than metal ion batteries, metal air batteries (MABs) have been widely concerned in energy storage fields due to their ultrahigh energy density. In general, precious metal catalysts like Pt and Ru work as the air cathode for MABs, whose practical applications are limited by high cost and short operating life.152 To overcome the above limitations, MOF-based materials have been considered to be promising candidates for high-performance electrocatalysts with low expense and abundant sources for MABs, accelerating their practical use in industrial production. In 2017, Wang et al. synthesized hierarchical porous N,S-co-doped carbon with CoNi bimetallic sulfide nanoparticles encapsulated inside (Ni–Co–S@G/NSC) using NH2-MIL-101(Al) as the sacrificial template.153 Owing to the unique architecture and good synergy between the active species, the as-prepared Ni–Co–S@G/NSC displayed considerable catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). As expected, ultrahigh capacity and energy density can be achieved in the full cell test, illustrating the potential of MOF-derived metal compounds as the high-performance electrocatalysts. Similarly, self-sacrificing template method is also applicable for the design of MOF-based electrocatalysts for practical applications in other MAB full cell system. For instance, cobalt nitride nanoparticles in nitrogen-doped graphene aerogel with a three-dimensional architecture (denoted as CoNx/NGA) was synthesized via pyrolysis of ZIF-67 on porous graphene aerogel and employed as a trifunctional electrocatalyst for a Zn–air full cell system to drive a full water splitting device.154 Based on the high catalytic activity and long cycling life, the Zn–air full cell was used to drive a full water splitting device (Fig. 11b). Remarkably, the molar ratio of the evolved O2 and H2 was approximately 1:2 as expected (Fig. 11c), indicating the great potential for practical production.
With the development of technology, people have developed more inclination toward the “green chemistry” concept dealing with negligible pollution. With this aim, the electrochemical devices with negligible pollution generators like solar cells and fuel cells have been widely studied. Early in 2015, Lee et al. reported a MOF-modified TiO2-based solar cell with MOF layers grown on TiO2via the solvothermal treatment of Co(NO3)2·3H2O and benzenedicarboxylic acid (H2BDC) or 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid (H2NDC).155 The smaller energy gap for extraction of photoexcited electrons to the FTO electrode was provided by the Co centers, resulting in good power conversion efficiency comparable to the Ru-MOF based similar device. This result not only demonstrated the important role of active ingredients to improve operating efficiency but also indicated the potential of MOF-based materials for better utilization of the solar energy in order to realize pollution-free energy supplement.
According to the above research studies, a similar principle is applicable to the design of MOF-based cell components. For example, the conversion-type anodes with high theoretical capacities can be applied in the PIB full cells, whose design also focuses on the composition and morphology control. The design of catalysts for MABs and solar cells also concerns the catalytic activity, the dispersion and the structural robustness. These results revealed more possibilities and prospects for the applications of MOF-based materials in practical full cell devices and offered more developmental space for the future research studies on energy industry.
8. Summary and outlook
MOF-Based materials, as high-performance new materials for energy storage and conversion, have been confirmed to be suitable for different components including electrodes, electrocatalysts, electrolytes and modified separators in advanced batteries. More importantly, according to the present research progress, numerous efforts have been devoted to the practical application of MOF-based materials in full cell systems of various rechargeable batteries including lithium batteries, sodium batteries, aqueous batteries, fuel cells, etc., indicating their great potential for commercialization in the energy industry.
The main concerns for the preparation of MOF-based materials are as follows: (1) to use the optimized combination of metal salts and organic ligands for the construction of targeted building blocks with proper apertures; (2) to choose suitable conditions including solvents, reacting time, temperature and other treatments like deposition and magnetic stirring for self-assembly in order to achieve facile and environmentally friendly synthesis as well as particle size control; (3) to adjust parameters of calcination including annealing steps, gas atmosphere and temperature to obtain the targeted MOF derivatives like metal oxides (MO), metal/carbon composites (M/C) and metal oxide/carbon composites (MO/C) which also extended this type of combination for metal chalcogenides and phosphides; and (4) to extend the morphology and composition of the final products by using hard templates or carrying out chemical reactions such as sulfurization, selenization, etc. Based on the above synthetic processes, directional preparation of MOF-based materials for specific functions in rechargeable batteries can be achieved, which sheds light on the development of next-generation electrical devices. Although fruitful results have demonstrated the applicability of MOF-based materials in batteries, there is still a long way for their commercialization and production on a large scale. Despite the obstacles for practical applications, numerous attempts have been made to confirm the applicability of MOF-based materials in full cells coupled with commercial materials.
During the design of pristine MOFs for full cells, the following requirements need to be taken into consideration: (1) to provide more active sites with metal centers or organic clusters for higher redox activity; (2) to obtain porous structure to enhance the surface area for supplying larger contact area between electrolytes and active substances as well as provide channels for ion and electron transport; and (3) to utilize the chemical interactions between MOFs and active substances to prevent the side reactions between electrolytes and active materials or shuttle effects and metal dendrite growth for higher electrochemical efficiency. Despite the enticing properties of pristine MOFs for full cell applications, some inherent flaws, like low conductivity, poor stability and serious irreversible reactions, constraint their practical use. To address the above demerits, following solutions ought to be considered: (1) to construct rigid conductive frameworks for higher conductivity and cycling stability; (2) to combine the merits of MOFs with other substances by using MOFs as modifiers and fillers or by the construction of MOF composites; and (3) to utilize MOFs as self-sacrificing templates for the directional synthesis of MOF derivatives with better practicality for full cell systems. For MOF composites, the following information ought to be considered: (1) to obtain MOF particles in nano size; (2) to achieve uniform growth of MOFs; (3) to form stable interfaces by chemical interactions; and (4) to guarantee the conductivity for easy ion and electron transmission by using conductive and porous frameworks. When compared with pristine MOFs, MOF-derived materials also delivered more potential for practical production in battery technologies. When employed as components for full cells, some principles should be followed in design of MOF derivatives: (1) to obtain well-dispersed metal or metal oxide nanoparticles based on specific functioning requirements under reduction or oxidation gas atmosphere; (2) to retain the carbon matrix for higher electric conductivity and larger surface area for abundant active sites as well as contacting areas between electrolytes and active substances; (3) to accurately adjust morphology and composition of the resulting products using suitable temperature and hard substrates; and (4) to import heteroatom through in situ pyrolysis of organic ligands or simple chemical reactions with external sources for expansion of more functioning derivatives and improvement of electrochemical activity. The procedures and main principles for the design of MOF-based materials are summarized in Scheme 1.

By following the progress of MOF chemistry in full cell applications, the functionality and applicability of MOF-based materials for practical use in advanced rechargeable batteries have been explored. However, some technical difficulties still exist for the combination of MOF chemistry and full cell technologies in practical industrial production. For one thing, pollution hazards and high expenses may be caused by the usage of some toxic metal ions and organic reagents during the preparation of MOFs. For this issue, some less toxic metals like Zn and Fe or aqueous systems with less pollution should be considered to adapt the green chemistry concept. For another thing, the complexity of the synthetic routes and parameters makes large-scale production more difficult, resulting in lower efficiency. To address this, in-depth studies on the mechanisms of synthesis and functioning for MOF-based materials still need to be carried out. Additionally, the poor stability in full cell systems is the main issue for practical use on a large scale. In order to address this demerit, the utilization of a stable organic framework like zeolitic imidazolate framework and the implementation of structural engineering like surface modification and 3D hard substrate supporting are promising strategies for alleviation of the volumetric expansion and structural collapse during operation in full cells. We believe that, with further research studies on MOF-based materials with precision instruments, an optimized synthetic process will be figured out and put into practice. In conclusion, this review provides experience and prospectives for the preparation and practical applications of MOF-based materials as cell components in high-performance full cells, shedding light on future development of the electrochemical energy industry.
