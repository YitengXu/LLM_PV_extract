    , Accepted 15th April 2018First published on 17th April 2018AbstractA water/alcohol soluble small molecular cathode interlayer (CIL) with the quaternary ammonium ions terminated by trihydroxybenzene as the pendant polar functionalities and a commercially available spirobifluorene (SBF) as a 3D-structural conjugated backbone, namely, TBSBF, was synthesized and applied in conventional single-junction polymer solar cells (PSCs). TBSBF was found to effectively enhance the performance of the PSCs by simultaneously increasing the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). Combined measurements of the current density–voltage characteristics, ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) and the electron mobility demonstrated that TBSBF could effectively increase the built-in potential and electronic mobility, leading to higher performance of the devices. In addition, the atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements showed that TBSBF could self-assemble into a leopard print-like pattern on the hydrophobic active layer surface. These results not only indicate TBSBF is a promising CIL material for the future solution-processed PSCs, but also provide a new way to design efficient CILs with good film-formation properties.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted great attention owing to their potential use in fabricating low-cost devices that can convert solar energy into electricity.1 Recently, significant efforts have been focused on developing bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells (PSCs) because of their unique features such as the marginal weight, simple fabrication and flexibility.2 Currently, single junction PSCs have been constructed with power conversion efficiencies (PCE) exceeding 13%.3 However, there are still many factors restricting the performance of PSCs including the limited light harvesting, inadequate exciton separation and low carrier mobility.4 In general, the PSCs have a sandwich structure comprised of a blend active layer with conjugated polymer as the donor and a soluble fullerene derivative or non-fullerene molecule as the acceptor between the anode and cathode. In order to improve the PCE of PSCs, numerous attempts have been made including synthesizing new materials,5 optimizing device structures6 and engineering interfaces.7 Particularly, cathode interlayers (CILs) incorporated between the active layer and the cathode have been extensively studied to improve the device performance as CILs function by alleviating the energy barriers and facilitating electrons extracted from the active layer to the cathode.8 Water/alcohol-soluble conjugated organic polymeric or small molecular CILs have commonly been regarded as the best options for interfacial materials because of their unique properties, such as easy to implement solution processing using environment-friendly solvent and the orthogonal solubility with the organic solvents that process the active layer.9
Normally, several polar ionic functionalities are needed on the polar terminals to ensure that CILs of conventional PSC have good solubility in strongly polar solvents (water/alcohol). However, the active layers, which are prepared from weakly polar solvents, are highly hydrophobic. This would commonly lead to poor wettability of hydrophilic CILs on the surface of the active layer due to orthogonal solubility. Poor wettability is typically accompanied by bad film-formation properties.10 Therefore, there is still an urgent need to construct a uniform, stable and well-distributed CIL that could form a wholly continuous cover on the active layer to promote the Ohmic contact between the active layer and metal cathode for highly efficient PSCs. Although a variety of water/alcohol soluble dipolar electrolytes based on different π-conjugated skeletons have emerged in recent years,11 developing a new strategy to obtain CILs with good film-formation ability is significant for the further development of PSCs. In addition, small molecular electrolytes are more attractive compared to their polymeric counterparts, owing to their intrinsic advantages such as simple synthesis, ease of purification, well defined structures, and good batch-to-batch reproducibility.12
Recently, the 3D-structural spirobifluorene (SBF) has attracted great attention. As a highly twisted and π-conjugated skeleton, SBF has been widely applied as the conjugated core in order to reduce the anisotropic and non-uniform characteristics of thin films and the molecules designed by this strategy have achieved much success.13 In this contribution, we utilized SBF as the conjugated backbone to obtain a small molecular CIL with good film-formation property. It is notable that the SBF backbone is commercially available, and SBF based CILs are therefore more accessible than most reported CILs prepared by complicated synthesis. 1,2,3-Trihexyloxybenzene terminated by quaternary ammonium ions, which can be flexibly connected to most skeletons in pendant fashion, was used for the polar terminals to achieve a dipolar molecule named TBSBF (Fig. 1a). The molecule could be easily dissolved in polar solvents such as water and methanol. Subsequently, conventional bulk heterojunction structured PSCs with PTB7:PC71BM or PTB7-Th:PC71BM (PTB7: poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl] [3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno [3,4-b]thiophenediyl]]; PTB7-Th: poly[[2,6′-4,8-di(5-ethylhexylthienyl)benzo[1,2-b;3,3-b]-dithiophene][3-fluoro-2[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl] thieno [3,4-b]-thiophenediyl]]; PC71BM: [6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester) as the active layer were fabricated (Fig. 1b and c). The self-assembly properties of TBSBF were effectively utilized to fabricate the wholly continuous and well-distributed CIL on the surface of the active layer. As a result, the performance of the PSCs were significantly improved via the simultaneously enhanced open circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). Our study serves the dual roles of both applying the commercially available and 3D-structured SBF skeleton in the field of cathode modification to reduce the heterogeneity of CILs and providing a new method for depositing CILs with good film-formation ability on the hydrophobic active layer surface.

Results and discussion
As shown in Scheme 1, the intermediate SBF-THBBr was synthesized by the Suzuki coupling of 2,7-dibromo-9,9′-spirobifluorene (SBF-Br) and 3,4,5-tris((6-bromohexyl)oxy)phenyl pinacolato borolane (PBE-THBBr),12b followed by the ionization of SBF-THBBr with trimethylamine to afford TBSBF. The molecular structures of the intermediates and the target molecule were confirmed by 1H NMR, elemental analysis and mass spectrometry. TBSBF could be easily dissolved in polar solvents such as water, methanol and ethanol without using any acid, which is helpful for the stability of the devices. Moreover, TBSBF was insoluble in chlorobenzene or o-dichlorobenzene, which could facilitate the fabrication of a multilayer device without destroying the active layer. Furthermore, TBSBF displayed good thermal stability with a decomposition temperature higher than 215 °C, as shown in Fig. 2c. Good thermal stability cannot ensure high stability for OSCs. However, the thermal stability of CILs could benefit the stability of devices for the following reasons: (1) as the device would be heated by the excess light energy that cannot be converted to electric current, the thermal stability of TBSBF could provide good temperature tolerance for OSCs; (2) the insertion of CIL could improve the PCE of the device, which could weaken the heat accumulation in the devices and benefit the stability of the PSC; (3) the CIL could protect the active layer from the high-temperature metal although it establishes contact with the metal directly when the metal cathode is evaporated. Thus, the CIL with good thermal stability is necessary for the real application of OSCs.

The UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 2a) of TBSBF in methanol and thin film are similar, signifying that the chromophore in TBSBF should adopt a loosely aggregated sate in the film. The optical band gap (Eoptg) of TBSBF was calculated to be 3.25 eV based on the thin film absorption onsets. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out to determine the frontier molecular orbital energy levels of TBSBF (Fig. 2b). Based on the oxidation potential onset, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level was estimated to be −5.58 eV, and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level was calculated to be −2.33 eV via the Eoptg value and HOMO level. The detailed data are summarized in Table 1, and the energy level alignment of each component is shown in Fig. 3. From these data it is clear that TBSBF would form interfacial dipoles at the interface, which could lower the work function of the cathode and facilitate the electron transfer of the PSCs. This was further demonstrated by the following measurements.

In order to investigate its interfacial modification ability, TBSBF was spin-coated on the top of the active layer from the methanol solution, similarly to a CIL for the conventional PSCs with a configuration of [ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/TBSBF/Al] (ITO: indium tin oxide, PEDOT:PSS: poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)) (Fig. 1b and c). In comparison, three comparative devices were also constructed: Al-only device without CIL, methanol-treated device made by spin-coating methanol on the active layer, and a device with a LiF thin film (0.7 nm). The TBSBF solutions with different concentrations were tested and the optimized concentration was found to be 0.5 mg mL−1 (3000 rpm spin speed). The optimized thickness was estimated to be around 2 nm. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G irradiation and the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the devices are shown in Fig. 4a and b, and the device parameters of Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE were summarized in Table 2. To ensure the validity and reproducibility of the data, more than 20 devices were tested for each configuration and the averaged PCEs are also listed in Table 2. As the data shows, the TBSBF could significantly enhance the performance of PSCs, with simultaneously improved Jsc, Voc, and FF, leading to a PCE of 8.64%. This value was increased by 56% compared to bare Al devices, and is even higher than the PCE of LiF modified devices (PCE: 7.35%) with an 18% improvement. However, the methanol treated devices displayed only slightly improved PCE (6.62%), indicating that the improvement in PCE of TBSBF modified is mainly attributed to the CIL itself rather than the solvent (methanol). These results indicated that TBSBF could effectively enhance the performance of PSCs. In addition, EQE (external quantum efficiency) spectra were also performed to detect the discrepancy of the Jsc. The EQE spectra in the range from 300 to 800 nm are shown in Fig. 4b, and the JEQEsc values integrated from the EQE spectra are summarized in Table 2. The integrated values matched well with the tested values within 5% error, indicating that the Jsc data presented in Fig. 4a were not overvalued. The absorption spectra of the PTB7:PC71BM films before and after the various layer treatment process are presented in Fig. 4c. From these data, it is clear that the introduction of the interlayer has only a slight effect on the absorption property of solar cells in this study.

The UPS (ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy) measurements were carried out to detect the work function (WF) change of the cathode when the CIL was inserted with monochromatized HeI radiation at 21.22 eV. Fig. 5a presents the UPS spectra of bare Al, methanol treated Al and TBSBF modified Al. The WF values, which are defined by the secondary electron cut-off in the UPS spectra, are 4.18 eV for bare Al, which is in accordance with other reported results,14 3.54 eV for the methanol-treated Al and 3.44 eV for the TBSBF modified Al, respectively. Clearly, the WF value decreased from 4.18 eV to 3.44 eV with an increase in Voc. It has been reported that the increase in built-in potential (Vbi) is the basic reason for the Voc enhancement. It is commonly accepted that the Vbi of the device was determined by the work function of anode and the cathode,15 and the dipolar TBSBF could form the interfacial dipole at the cathode interface to depress the work function of the cathode through the interaction between the pedant polar functionalities and the cathode.8a,16 Thus, although the dielectric constant of LiF is higher than the organic interfacial layer, the Vbi of the TBSBF modified device was higher than the LiF modified devices.

The water contact angle (θ) measurement was found to be an efficient way of studying the interfacial dipole. The reduced contact angle represents the accumulation of polar components at the top of the organic surface after covering the CILs.10b As shown in Fig. 6, measurements of the water contact angle (θ) were carried out on the surface of pristine PTB7:PC71BM film, methanol treated PTB7:PC71BM film and TBSBF modified PTB7:PC71BM film. The water contact angles (θ) were 98.1° for pristine PTB7:PC71BM film, 95.6° for methanol treated PTB7:PC71BM film and 73.6° for TBSBF covered film. This clearly indicates that methanol treatment did not change the hydrophobic nature of the PTB7:PC71BM film. However, the coverage of TBSBF significantly decreased the water contact angle (θ) of the film, suggesting the accumulation of polar groups at the topmost organic surface. This implies that the incorporation of TBSBF could facilitate the formation of interfacial dipoles at the cathode interface, which is in favour of the charge injection and collection in the PSCs.

The turn-on voltage could also reflect the Vbi of the devices. Thus, we measured the J–V characteristics of all devices in the dark to investigate the turn-on voltages of the devices. As shown in Fig. 5b, in the region from 0 to 1 V, the turn-on voltages were determined to be 0.71, 0.75, 0.79 and 0.81 V for the devices with bare Al, methanol-treated Al, LiF/Al and TBSBF/Al, respectively. This indicates that the introduction of TBSBF could distinctly increase the Vbi of the device with an increase in Voc. Moreover, the J–V curves under dark could also be used in evaluating the charge transport and collection property of the devices. In the region from −1 to 0 V, the reverse current of the LiF and TBSBF modified devices were largely suppressed compared to the bare Al device or methanol-treated device. The suppressed dark currents indicated that TBSBF was similar to LiF in blocking hole transfer and improving charge selectivity at the cathode interface. Thus, the insertion of TBSBF could improve the charge collection in the PSCs, leading to the improvement in FF.
For the TBSBF modified devices, the higher FF was also consistent with the decreased series resistance (Rs) which is summarized in Table 2. It was reported that Rs played a significant role in FF.14 A decreased Rs indicates better ohmic contact, giving rise to the FF.17 As listed in Table 2, the methanol-treatment could slightly decrease the Rs, and the Rs of the LiF modified devices was nearly the same as that of the methanol treated device. However, the Rs of the TBSBF modified devices clearly decreased, with a value of 4.97 Ω cm2, indicating that the optimum Ohmic contact for charge transfer and extraction was achieved at the cathode interface when TBSBF was used as CIL.
The electronic mobility could be directly detected by measurements based on the space charge limited current (SCLC) technique with a device configuration of [ITO/Al/LiF/PTB7:PC71BM/with or without TBSBF/Al]. The J1/2–V curves of the electron-only devices are presented in Fig. 7. As calculated from the data in Fig. 7, the electron mobility of the methanol-treated device (4.69 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) was in the same order of magnitude with the bare Al device (1.10 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). When TBSBF was used as a CIL, the electron mobility significantly increased, exhibiting a value of 2.33 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was further improved compared to that of the LiF modified devices (1.37 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Clearly, the improvements in electron mobility of TBSBF incorporated devices is revealed, which is in accordance with the increasing trend of Jsc and FF listed in Table 2.

Fig. 8 shows the surface morphologies of the films with or without TBSBF obtained by the atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements under ambient temperature. The surface of pristine PTB7:PC71BM film exhibited a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 2.21 nm (Fig. 8a). Methanol treatment caused a slightly smoother surface with RMS roughness of 1.96 nm, as shown in Fig. 8b. The deposition of TBSBF on the hydrophobic active layer resulted in a smooth surface with RMS roughness of 2.15 nm (Fig. 8c). It is worthy to note that TBSBF exhibits uniform and leopard print-like pattern on the PTB7:PC71BM surface. This suggested that the TBSBF may have self-assembly characteristics. To verify this speculation, we further spin-coated the TBSBF on the mica substrate with hydrophobic surface (3000 rpm, 40 s) and tested its surface morphology via AFM measurement. As shown in Fig. 8d, the cross-linked, uniform and leopard print-like pattern could also be detected, indicating the self-assembly property on the substrate surface. The self-assembly feature of TBSBF may be beneficial to the Ohmic contact at the interface, leading to higher Jsc and FF of the devices.

The TBSBF was also introduced to the PTB7-Th:PC71BM based devices to demonstrate its versatility. The J–V characteristics of the devices under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G irradiation are presented in Fig. 9a, and the device parameters are summarized in Table 3. The solar cell that employed TBSBF as the CIL displayed a Jsc of 16.88 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.81 V and a FF of 67.7%, leading to a PCE of 9.26%, which was increased by 11% and 41% compared to those devices with LiF and no CIL, respectively. The EQE spectra of these devices are shown in Fig. 9b. The Jsc calculated from the EQE spectra agreed well with the tested values. These results demonstrate the versatility of the TBSBF for PSCs with different photoactive layers and verify again the promising prospect of TBSBF as a CIL in the future PSCs application.

Conclusions
In summary, a small molecular conjugated water/alcohol soluble CIL, namely, TBSBF, was successfully synthesized and applied in conventional single-junction PSCs. The molecule used the quaternary ammonium ions terminated trihydroxybenzene as the polar side chain to ensure the good solubility in polar solvent. In addition, the commercially available 3D-structured spirobifluorene (SBF) was employed as the π-conjugated core to increase the homogeneity of the CIL as it was deposited onto the hydrophobic active layer. The BHJ devices with TBSBF as the cathode interlayer and PTB7 or PTB7-Th:PC71BM as the active layer showed power conversion efficiencies of 8.64% and 9.26%, respectively, which were drastically improved by 56% and 41% compared to the devices without CIL. The TBSBF could effectively lower the work function of the Al cathode, increase the built-in potential, and decrease the Rs in the PSCs. Our study not only provides a promising CIL for future PSCs, but also devises a new strategy for obtaining smooth and uniform CILs on the hydrophobic active layer surface.

PTB7 and PTB7-Th were purchased from 1-material Chemscitech Inc. (Canada). PC71BM was purchased from American Dye Source, Inc. LiF, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), chlorobenzene (CB) and methanol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as delivered.
All devices of PSCs were fabricated with a simple conventional structure. The ITO-coated glass was carefully pre-cleaned with detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol in an ultrasonic bath, and treated with plasma for 7 min. After filtration through a 0.45 μm filter, the PEDOT:PSS (Baytron PVP Al 4083) layer was spin coated and baked at 120 °C for 10 min to form a 35 nm-thick thin film on the cleaned ITO substrate. The devices were then transferred to the nitrogen glove box. Then, the active layer was prepared on the top of PEDOT:PSS layer from the blend CB solution of PTB7 (or PTB7-Th):PC71BM (1:1.5 w/w, total concentration of 25 mg mL−1) with 3 vol% DIO. The solution was spin-coated onto the substrate at 1000 rpm for 40 s and then dried in vacuum to remove the residual DIO. The thickness of the active layer was ca. 110 nm. The TBSBF cathode interlayer was subsequently deposited onto the active layer from the methanol solution with a concentration of 0.5 mg mL−1 at 3000 rpm for 40 s. Finally, 100 nm Al was thermal-deposited under a pressure of 2 × 10−6 mbar.
Measurements and characterization
Photovoltaic performances of the devices were tested under 1 sun, AM 1.5 full-spectrum solar simulator (Photo Emission Tech., model #SS50AAA-GB) with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2 calibrated with a standard silicon solar cell of the National Institute of Metrology, China. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics under light and darkness were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter. The device area was 0.04 cm2. A Q Test station (Crowntech Inc., Macungie, PA) was used to measure external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra under ambient condition. AFM was carried out directly on the surface of the as-fabricated devices in the DFM mode under ambient conditions using an S II Nanonavi probe station 300 Hz (Seiko, Japan). The AFM images and RMS values were drawn and calculated by the software Nanonavi Analysis. In addition, the contact angles were measured on a commercial contact angle system (DatePhysics, OCA 20) at ambient temperature with the 4 μL water droplet as the indicator.
The electron mobility of the devices was measured by the SCLC (space charge limited current) method with a device structure of [ITO/Al/PTB7:PC71BM/with or without TBSBF/Al]. The mobility was calculated by the following equation:  where J is the current density, εr is the dielectric constant of the material (assumed to be 3.9), ε0 is the vacuum permittivity (8.8542 × 10−12 F m−1), d is the film thickness (around 110 nm in this study) and V is the voltage drop across the device, V = Vapp − Vr − Vbi. Vr (the voltage drop due to contact resistance and series resistance across the electrodes) and Vbi (the built-in voltage of the device due to the difference in work function of the electrodes at both sides of the active layer) were subtracted from Vapp (experimental applied voltage).
