    , Accepted 26th May 2022First published on 27th May 2022AbstractCharge transfer cocrystals offer an opportunity to construct high performance organic photothermal materials. However, it is still challenging to modulate the degree of charge transfer of cocrystals to achieve rationally designed photothermal functional materials. Herein three charge transfer cocrystals composed of carbazole (CZ)/3,6-dichlorocarbazole (ClCZ)/3,6-dibromocarbazole (BrCZ) as π-donors (D) and 7,7′,8,8′-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) as a π-acceptor (A), namely CZ/TCNQ, ClCZ/TCNQ and BrCZ/TCNQ, were obtained and subjected to spectroscopic and photothermal conversion studies as well as density functional theory calculations. The crystal structures reveal that the donor and acceptor molecules of each cocrystal adopt a ⋯DADADA⋯ mixed stack structure. With steric hindrance and electron withdrawing effects of chlorine/bromine atoms on carbazole, the charge transfer degree of CZ/TCNQ is reduced from 0.25 to 0.07 for ClCZ/TCNQ and 0.03 for BrCZ/TCNQ. The three cocrystals display broad absorption over the 300 to 900 nm range without significant photon emission. The near-infrared photothermal conversion efficiency reaches 53.7% (CZ/TCNQ), 48.5% (ClCZ/TCNQ) and 32.0% (BrCZ/TCNQ), respectively. These cocrystals have narrowed HOMO–LUMO gaps, which is attributed to the strong charge transfer transition and agrees with the photophysical and photothermal conversion properties of the cocrystals. This study demonstrates that the modulation of the charge transfer degree by intelligent design of donor–acceptor pairs can be an effective means to regulate the photothermal conversion efficiency of charge transfer cocrystals. Finally, CZ/TCNQ was successfully applied as an appealing photothermal material in photothermal imaging and functional electrical device control.
Introduction
Organic photothermal materials, which convert photoenergy to thermal energy through light-harvesting and non-emissive deactivation processes, have attracted considerable attention due to their great potential applications in photothermal therapy,1,2 photothermal imaging3,4 and photo-thermal electric devices.5,6 Recently, charge transfer cocrystals of donor–acceptor molecular pairs, within which charge transfers from electron-sufficient donors to electron-deficient acceptors, have been utilized as a simple, effective and low cost means to construct high performance organic photothermal materials.7–10 However, it is still challenging to modulate the charge transfer nature, such as the degree of charge transfer, of donor–acceptor cocrystals to achieve rationally designed photothermal functional materials.11
Carbazole (CZ, Fig. 1) demonstrates superior electron-donating capacity and remarkable optical properties,12 which make it a promising candidate for use in such diverse technologies as organic light-emitting diodes,13 bioimaging,14 and dye-sensitized solar cells.15 The halogenate substances of carbazole, 3,6-dichlorocarbazole (ClCZ) and 3,6-dibromocarbazole (BrCZ), include chlorine/bromine atoms with steric hindrance and electron withdrawing effects on the two benzene rings, which may change the π⋯π packing and electron-donating capacity of carbazole. 7,7′,8,8′-Tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) is a representative electron acceptor due to its four –CN groups with strong electron withdrawing capacity, and is often used to fabricate various charge transfer cocrystals toward tuneable optoelectronic properties against individual donors.16–18 In the present work, we chose CZ, ClCZ, and BrCZ as donors with variable π⋯π packing and electron-donating capacity, and TCNQ as an acceptor to construct a group of cocrystals (CZ/TCNQ, ClCZ/TCNQ and BrCZ/TCNQ) with tuneable charge transfer interactions, with the intention of exploiting the relationship of the charge transfer degree and photothermal conversion properties of the cocrystals. The as-prepared cocrystals were characterized by single crystal and powder X-ray diffraction as well as thermal analysis. Spectroscopic and photothermal conversion studies and density functional theory calculations were carried out to explore the structure–property relationship of the charge transfer cocrystal photothermal conversion materials at a molecular level. Finally, the cocrystal with appealing photothermal conversion properties was applied in photothermal imaging and functional electrical device control.

Results and discussion
Three cocrystals of TCNQ with CZ, ClCZ and BrCZ were prepared by a simple and convenient method. Equimolar mixtures of CZ/ClCZ/BrCZ and TCNQ were suspended in acetonitrile, and black powdered cocrystals CZ/TCNQ, ClCZ/TCNQ and BrCZ/TCNQ can be easily harvested by filtration. Then rod-shaped black crystals were obtained by slow evaporation of the above filtrates for about one week. Photographs of the constituting compounds and microscopy images of the cocrystals are shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen that the powders of the pristine molecules show a white to brown colour, reflecting their poor or modest optical absorption over the visible spectrum. In contrast, the three cocrystals demonstrate a solid black colour showing good optical absorption for the entire visible spectrum.
To elucidate the details of various intermolecular interactions and crystal packing, the single crystal structures of ClCZ/TCNQ and BrCZ/TCNQ were determined and resolved in this work while the crystal structure of CZ/TCNQ has been reported19 and was retrieved from the Cambridge Structural Database (CCDC number 1121578). Crystallographic data and details of refinements are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). Crystal structure analysis reveals the 1:1 stoichiometric ratio of donor and acceptor molecules for each cocrystal. Both ClCZ/TCNQ and BrCZ/TCNQ crystallize in the monoclinic I2/a space group with similar cell parameters (a = 12.1500 (2) Å, b = 13.1041 (2) Å, c = 13.7735 (2) Å, α = 90°, β = 112.503 (2)°, γ = 90° and V = 2025.97 (6) Å3 for ClCZ/TCNQ, and a = 12.3323 (4) Å, b = 13.1469 (3) Å, c = 13.9845(5) Å, α = 90°, β = 113.945 (4)°, γ = 90° and V = 2072.19 (13) Å3 for BrCZ/TCNQ) (Table S1, ESI†). The donor and acceptor molecules are stacked face to face generating ⋯DADADA⋯ column-like structures with π⋯π interactions (with distances of 3.443 Å for ClCZ/TCNQ and 3.497 Å for BrCZ/TCNQ) along the c axis (Fig. 2a and S1a, ESI†), implying that there exist strong D–A interactions. Then neighbouring columns pack together to construct a rigid three-dimensional (3D) network (Fig. 2b and S1b, ESI†). CZ/TCNQ belongs to the monoclinic C2/m space group with cell parameters of a = 11.249 (4) Å, b = 12.973 (4) Å, c = 6.674 (1) Å, α = 90°, β = 107.59 (2)°, γ = 90° and V = 928.42 Å3 (Table S1, ESI†). It also exhibits a ⋯DADADA⋯ column-like structure with π⋯π interactions (3.260 Å) between the CZ and TCNQ molecules (Fig. S2a, ESI†). Then a similar 3D structure is formed from the columns (Fig. S2b, ESI†). Although the three cocrystals are similar in their crystal structures, the rank order of the π⋯π distances between the donor and acceptor is CZ/TCNQ < ClCZ/TCNQ < BrCZ/TCNQ. The π⋯π distance was lengthened and thereby the π⋯π overlap was reduced by the steric hindrance of chlorine/bromine atoms on the 3,6-substituted positions of carbazole. Together with the electron withdrawing effects of chlorine/bromine, it may weaken the charge transfer interactions of the cocrystals.

The extent of the molecular geometric change accompanying charge transfer is generally dictated by the amount of charge transfer. Therefore, information on bond length changes of TCNQ obtained by X-ray crystallography can be used as a quantitative measure of charge transfer. In this work, the reported method was used to extract the amount of charge transfer from the bond lengths of TCNQ.20–22 The calculated values of the charge transfer degree ρ of CZ/TCNQ, ClCZ/TCNQ and BrCZ/TCNQ are 0.25, 0.07 and 0.03, respectively. The change trend of the charge transfer degree exhibits a quantitative order of charge transfer interactions: CZ/TCNQ > ClCZ/TCNQ > BrCZ/TCNQ, which agrees well with the π⋯π distances between the donor and acceptor molecules (3.260 Å for CZ/TCNQ, 3.443 Å for ClCZ/TCNQ, and 3.497 Å for BrCZ/TCNQ).
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements were further used to check the crystalline nature of the bulk powdered samples of the cocrystals (Fig. 3a, S3a and S4a, ESI†). The PXRD patterns of the cocrystals are obviously different from those of the pristine donor and acceptor compounds and suggest the formation of new crystalline phases. In addition, all the peaks displayed in the experimental patterns basically match with those in the simulated patterns from the single crystal data, confirming the phase purity and homogeneity of the cocrystals. Moreover, the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves show that the peaks of the cocrystals, on account of melting, significantly increase compared to those of the pristine donors, indicating their better thermostability due to the strong intermolecular interactions (Fig. 3b, S3b and S4b, ESI†). The fusion temperature and melting enthalpy of each cocrystal are summarized in Table S2.†

The photophysical properties of the cocrystals were then investigated. As shown in Fig. 3c, all pristine donors exhibit absorption bands in the range of 300–500 nm, which are ascribed to π → π* transitions of their conjugation structures. After formation of the cocrystals, CZ/TCNQ, ClCZ/TCNQ and BrCZ/TCNQ show new, distinct broad absorption bands extending to 800–900 nm in the near-infrared region with a super large red-shift of 400–500 nm compared to the pristine donors, reflecting the strong charge transfer interactions in these cocrystal systems. Accordingly, the optical band gaps of CZ, ClCZ and BrCZ are 3.10 eV, 3.31 eV and 3.34 eV, respectively, while those of CZ/TCNQ, ClCZ/TCNQ and BrCZ/TCNQ are 1.46 eV, 1.48 eV and 1.49 eV. The band gap is the energy difference between two different electronic states. Generally, the narrower the energy band gap is, the more inclined the electrons in the two different states are to resonate and thereby the higher the rate of nonradiative transition is.23 This will probably lead to photothermal conversion. Further, no significant photon emission was observed for each cocrystal (Fig. S5, S3c and S4c, ESI†), confirming that non-radiative transition is really the dominant process. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was then used to identify the charge transfer states between the donors and TCNQ by observing the frequency shift of TCNQ as it is generally accepted that the formation of the charge transfer transition state leads to the increase of C–H and CC band frequency and the reduction of CN stretching bands.24 As shown in Fig. 3d, S3d (ESI†) and S4d (ESI†), the three cocrystals display an upshift for the C–H and CC stretching bands (CZ/TCNQ: 3142 and 1544 cm−1; ClCZ/TCNQ: 3144 and 1542 cm−1; and BrCZ/TCNQ: 3140 and 1542 cm−1) compared to the pristine TCNQ (3136 and 1540 cm−1), whereas the vibration band of TCNQ (2220 cm−1) reduces to 2218 cm−1 for all the three cocrystals. These results indicate the enhancement of electron cloud density for the benzene ring of TCNQ upon self-assembly with donor compounds.25 The observations in FT-IR spectroscopy are consistent with previous reports and can be considered as the proof of the charge transfer interactions.26,27
The efficient near-infrared absorption and poor photon emission provide the essential conditions for near-infrared photothermal conversion. Thus, the powdered cocrystals were illuminated by an 808 nm laser to evaluate their photothermal conversion performance. The temperature was recorded using an IR thermal camera (Fig. S6a, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 4a, S7a (ESI†) and S8a (ESI†), under the illumination of an 808 nm laser (0.48 Wcm−2), the temperature of CZ/TCNQ, ClCZ/TCNQ and BrCZ/TCNQ is sharply increased to 69.1°C, 65.5°C and 56.7°C, respectively. In contrast, without cocrystals the blank control system only increases to 28.8°C under the same conditions. The photothermal conversion efficiency was calculated from the cooling curve by a previous method (Fig. S6–S8, Table S3, ESI†).10 The results reach 53.7%, 48.5% and 32.0% for CZ/TCNQ, ClCZ/TCNQ and BrCZ/TCNQ, respectively. The highest photothermal conversion efficiency of CZ/TCNQ can be attributed to its highest degree of charge transfer and shortest π⋯π distance between the donor and acceptor. Notably, the PXRD measurements of the cocrystals after laser irradiation show that the crystal phases of these cocrystals remain stable with laser irradiation (Fig. S9, ESI†). In addition, the cyclic tests also demonstrate the good photostability of the cocrystals which may be in favour of further applications (Fig. 4b, S7b and S8b, ESI†). Fig. 4c, S7e (ESI†) and S8e (ESI†) show the heating and cooling curves of the cocrystals at different powers. This indicates that the ΔT of the cocrystals is proportional to the power of light excitation with a good linear relationship (Fig. 4d, S7f and S8f, ESI†). This result demonstrates that the photothermal conversion of these cocrystals can also be modulated by the excitation power.

To better understand the mechanism of the optical absorption and photothermal conversion properties of the cocrystals, molecular orbital energy levels were estimated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations based on experimentally obtained crystal structures. As shown in Fig. 5, it is observed that the electron density of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is mainly localized on the CZ/ClCZ/BrCZ and TCNQ, respectively. This confirms that the charge transfer transitions take place from CZ/ClCZ/BrCZ to TCNQ. The HOMO energy levels of CZ, ClCZ and BrCZ are −5.44 eV, −5.78 eV and −5.74 eV, respectively, which are reduced to −6.12 eV (CZ/TCNQ), −6.17 eV (ClCZ/TCNQ) and −6.30 eV (BrCZ/TCNQ) through the introduction of TCNQ with a lower energy level (−7.39 eV). Meanwhile, the three donor molecules have wide HOMO–LUMO gaps with values of 4.80 eV for CZ, 4.55 eV for ClCZ, and 4.51 eV for BrCZ. When they form charge transfer cocrystals with TCNQ, the HOMO–LUMO gaps are 1.61 eV for CZ/TCNQ, 1.77 eV for ClCZ/TCNQ and 1.87 eV for BrCZ/TCNQ, respectively. Although there exist varying degrees of differences between the experimental and theoretical band gaps, all cocrystals do exhibit significantly narrowed band gaps compared to the respective donor molecules from both experimental and theoretical perspectives. This is due to the strong charge transfer transition and agrees with the photophysical and photothermal conversion properties of the cocrystals.

The excellent photothermal properties of CZ/TCNQ makes it an intriguing candidate for photothermal imaging. Letters “TUT” fabricated with the powdered sample of CZ/TCNQ were irradiated under an 808 nm laser and the temperature increase was captured with an IR thermal camera. The cocrystal-patterned letters could be captured under irradiation, showing a high quality photothermal imaging effect (Fig. 6a). By taking advantage of the excellent light-to-heat conversion efficiency of CZ/TCNQ, it was also used in a photo-sensitive electrical switch (Fig. 6b). In this case, we saturated an aqueous suspension of CZ/TCNQ with NaCl (0.1 M) to make it conductive and then used it as a fluidic medium. A switch was constructed from a small vial connected to a capillary containing two standard copper wires with a gap of 5 mm between two ends (a and b in Fig. 6b). When the solution was irradiated by the 808 nm laser, it heated up and expanded along the capillary, bridging the gap between the two wires and completing an electrical circuit. The connection turned on a small light bulb. After turning off the laser irradiation, the solution level dropped and the light bulb was switched off (Movie S1, ESI†). The electrical switch could be operated through seven cycles of on and off irradiation without losing its performance (Fig. 6c), suggesting that it could be used to control electrical devices without requiring mechanical movement or large solid-state transistors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example demonstrating the potential use of photothermal cocrystals to control fluid motion and construct a functional electrical device.

Conclusions
In summary, three charge transfer cocrystals (CZ/TCNQ, ClCZ/TCNQ and BrCZ/TCNQ) composed of carbazole, 3,6-dichlorocarbazole and 3,6-dibromocarbazole as π-donors and TCNQ as a π-acceptor were successfully prepared. The crystal structure analysis reveals that the donor and acceptor molecules of each cocrystal are combined at a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio and adopt ⋯DADADA⋯ mixed stack arrangements, implying the existence of charge transfer interactions. With steric hindrance and electron withdrawing effects of chlorine/bromine atoms on carbazole, the charge transfer degree of CZ/TCNQ is reduced from 0.25 to 0.07 for ClCZ/TCNQ and 0.03 for BrCZ/TCNQ. The three cocrystals display broad absorption over the 300 to 900 nm range without significant photon emission. The near-infrared photothermal conversion efficiency reaches 53.7% (CZ/TCNQ), 48.5% (ClCZ/TCNQ) and 32.0% (BrCZ/TCNQ), respectively. These cocrystals have narrowed HOMO–LUMO gaps as compared to their respective donors, which is attributed to the strong charge transfer transition and agrees with the photophysical and photothermal conversion properties of the cocrystals. This study demonstrates that the modulation of the charge transfer degree by intelligent design of donor–acceptor pairs can be an effective means to regulate the photothermal conversion efficiency of charge transfer cocrystals. Finally, CZ/TCNQ was successfully applied as an appealing photothermal material in photothermal imaging and functional electrical device control.
