    , Accepted 17th October 2016First published on 7th November 2016AbstractOne of the current needs of applications involving perovskite solar cells is reducing the hysteresis of the current density–voltage response with respect to the scan direction and rate. This reduction enables high and stable power conversion efficiency (η). For this purpose, a mesoscopic electron conductor with low trap density and high electron conductivity that balances charge flux is highly desirable. In the present study, we prepared a mesoscopic inverse opal (meso-IO) film with a three-dimensionally interconnected porous structure and used it as an electron-conducting scaffold for perovskite solar cells. We controlled the thickness of the meso-IO scaffold and determined its effect on the cells' photovoltaic performance. Solar cells using the 600 nm thick meso-IO scaffold exhibited a maximum η of 17.1%, no hysteresis of photocurrent density between forward and reverse scan directions, as well as hysteresis of η of only 0.5% p.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites are promising materials for photovoltaics because of their strong absorptivity due to their direct bandgap, high open-circuit voltage (VOC) due to their small exciton binding energy, long diffusion length of charge carriers due to their low trap density, and solution processibility. Since the report of Kojima et al.1 on liquid-junction CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) perovskite sensitized solar cells, intensive studies have been done to develop highly efficient perovskite solar cells. These studies have produced perovskite solar cells with an efficiency of over 22% at 1 sun illumination.2 Various types of perovskite solar cells, such as mesoscopic,3–9 planar,10–15 bilayer,16–31 and meso-superstructured solar cells32–34 have been constructed. Mesoscopic perovskite solar cells utilize mesoscopic electron conductors into which electrons generated in the perovskite layer can be injected. This type of perovskite solar cell offers the advantage of highly reproducible formation of a uniform perovskite layer due to the mesoscopic electron-conducting layer. Furthermore, it prevents direct contact between the hole-conducting layer and the transparent electrode even when the perovskite film has pinholes.
The need to obtain high and stable power conversion efficiency (η) and to reduce the hysteresis in current density–voltage (J–V) response with respect to the scan direction and rate are some of the issues faced in the use of perovskite solar cells. Moreover, the balance between electron and hole fluxes is often a concern.31 With the lack of such a balance, charge carriers accumulate at the electron conductor/perovskite/hole conductor interface or in bulk traps, producing a capacitive element in the perovskite solar cells thereby causing a large hysteresis in the J–V response.5 Thus, mesoscopic electron conductors with low trap density and high electron conductivity or mobility are being sought. Studies have explored dendritic, nanowire architectured, flower patterned, inverse-opal-like, and Li-treated electron conductors.32,33 The dendrite nanostructure shows a 25% improvement in η compared with that of the nanorod structure. This structure increases the amount of perovskite loading, light harvesting, and efficiency of electron transport.32 The flower-patterned TiO2 nanostructure gives an efficiency of 16% because of its light-harvesting efficiency and charge collection from a large interfacial area of the nanostructure.34 Li-treated mesoscopic TiO2-based MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells have ∼17.2% efficiency and show no hysteresis of J–V response.1
In the present study, we prepared an inverse opal (IO) TiO2 electron conductor. It has been previously shown that the ordered and tightly interconnected frame of the IO structure improves charge collection by efficiently transporting electrons.35,36 Its well-defined interconnected pores facilitate electrolyte infiltration or hole transport in the material. However, few studies have attempted to use the IO structure in perovskite solar cells. This is probably because, a typical IO structure has several hundred nanometer-sized pore structures and thus, these structures are too large to fit in the perovskite electron conductor, which generally requires a similar thickness of electron conductor. Herein, we prepared a mesoscopic IO (meso-IO) structure, i.e., an IO structure with a pore size smaller than 100 nm, and used it as an electron conductor for perovskite solar cells. This study is the first to report such an application. We controlled the thickness of the meso-IO electron-conducting scaffold to be within 200–800 nm and determined the effect of the thickness on photovoltaic performance. With the meso-IO scaffold, we observed very low hysteresis (within 0.8% p) of the power conversion efficiency during forward and reverse scans. We found that the optimum thickness of the scaffold is 600 nm; this thickness enables sufficient light harvesting induced by light scattering while maintaining high charge drain and minimal defects in the film. Solar cells using the 600 nm thick meso-IO scaffold exhibited a maximum efficiency of 17.1%.
Results and discussion
The TiO2 meso-IO electron conductor scaffold was fabricated using PS colloidal crystal templates. Surface and cross-sectional SEM images of the PS opals are shown in Fig. 1a and b. We controlled the thickness of the PS colloidal crystal film to be within 600–1000 nm by varying the rate of dip coating. The film thickness of the colloidal assembly during dip-coating is related to the withdrawal velocity, as described by the following equation:37  where k is the colloidal crystal thickness, L is the length of the meniscus, je is the solvent evaporation rate, φ is the volume fraction of particles in the colloidal suspension, d is the diameter of the particles, and v is the withdrawal velocity of the substrate.
 Fig. 1  SEM images of the (a, b) PS opal and (c, d) TiO2 meso-IO films; insets are the digital camera images of each film. 
Since we used the same environmental temperature and particle volume fraction (10 wt%), the thickness was linearly proportional to the coating rate. PS opal crystals with thicknesses of around 1000 nm, 800 nm, 700 nm and 600 nm were obtained at coating rates of 11 mm min−1, 10 cm min−1, 9 cm min−1, and 8 cm min−1, respectively. The TiO2 meso-IO film was prepared using the PS opal crystals as templates. The pore size and skeleton width of the meso-IO scaffold are approximately 50 nm and 30 nm, respectively (Fig. 1c and d). The pores are fully interconnected by gaps with a diameter of approximately 20 nm. A TEM image of the meso-IO skeleton (Fig. S1, ESI†) clearly reveals that the structure consists of fused TiO2 particles with 35 nm size. This morphology is more fused than that of commercially available mesoscopic NP films (Fig. S1, ESI†). The poor connection between nanoparticles resulted in defects and interface states, creating charge-trapping centers that slow down charge transport.
The chemical state of TiO2 in the meso-IO scaffold was investigated by XPS. The Ti2p XPS spectrum is displayed in Fig. 2. We also compared the chemical state of IO TiO2 with that of the NP TiO2 film. The Ti2p spectrum (Fig. 2) contains two main peaks at 458.5 eV and 464.3 eV, which are attributed to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 core levels, respectively. We deconvoluted the peak at 458.5 eV using peaks at 457.7 eV and 458.6 eV; these binding energies correspond to the Ti3+ and Ti4+ states, respectively. The relative content of Ti3+/Ti4+ based on the calculated integrated area of the fitted peaks (Table 1) was 6.9% for meso-IO, whereas the content was 10.2% for the NP TiO2 film. The peak at 464.3 eV was also deconvoluted using peaks located at 462.3 eV and 464.4 eV, which correspond to the Ti3+ and Ti4+ states, respectively. The relative content of Ti3+/Ti4+ for the meso-IO and NP TiO2 films were found to be 6.2% and 7.7%, respectively. These analytical results show that the relative content of defects (i.e., Ti3+ or oxygen vacancy) of meso-IO TiO2 is lower than that of NP TiO2. The meso-IO TiO2 film therefore possesses fewer defective states and less defective morphology and is a superior electron conductor compared with the conventional film.

Fig. 3 displays a schematic of the device architecture and operation of the mesoscopic MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells built using the TiO2 meso-IO electron conducting scaffold. Upon exposure to light, the MAPbI3 perovskite generates electron–hole pairs, and the electrons and holes immediately transfer to the neighboring meso-IO electron conductor and hole conductor (PTAA), respectively. MAPbI3 perovskite is known to generate free charge carriers or loosely bonded excitons at room temperature because of its small exciton binding energy of less than ∼2kT (∼50 meV; k is the Boltzmann constant and T is absolute temperature). These free charge carriers can be transported to the electrode through the perovskite layer itself. Because the holes can move only through the MAPbI3 perovskite layer before arriving at the PTAA hole conductor, it is crucial to form the interconnected MAPbI3 perovskite structure within the mesoscopic scaffold in order to obtain reproducible high performance. The fully interconnected pore structure of the meso-IO structure facilitates the infiltration of MAPbI3 perovskite, thereby enabling the efficient extraction of holes.

Cross-sectional SEM images of the mesoscopic MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells each with a meso-IO TiO2 scaffold of different thickness (approximately 400 nm, 500 nm, 600 nm, and 800 nm) are shown in Fig. 4. The inset SEM cross-sectional image in Fig. 4a displays a solar cell constructed from bottom to top, layers consisted of FTO, bl-TiO2 (∼70 nm thickness), mesoscopic TiO2 IO (∼400 nm thickness) scaffold infiltrated by a MAPbI3 perovskite/PTAA (∼40 nm thickness), and Au (∼70 nm thickness) layer. It is clearly noted that the TiO2 meso-IO scaffold is fully infiltrated by MAPbI3 perovskite. During application of the perovskite solution on the electron conductor film, we observed that the MAPbI3 solution penetrated the meso-IO scaffold much faster than a conventional mesoscopic NP electrode. The facile infiltration may be attributed to the fully interconnected pore structure of meso-IO compared with that of the conventional NP structure.

The J–V curves of the mesoscopic MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells each with a meso-IO scaffold of different thickness are displayed in Fig. 5. Photovoltaic properties of the cells, namely, photocurrent density (JSC), VOC, fill factor (FF), and the power conversion efficiency (η) are summarized in Table 2. η gradually increases as the thickness of the meso-IO scaffold increases from 400 nm to 600 nm and then decreases at ∼800 nm thickness. η at 400 nm thickness was 15.3% during the forward scan and 15.9% during the reverse scan. At 500 nm, 600 nm, and 800 nm thicknesses, η reached 16.1%, 16.6%, and 16.0%, respectively, during the forward scan; it reached values of 16.7%, 17.1%, and 16.8%, respectively, during the reverse scan.

Fig. S2, ESI† indicates the average η and deviation of 20 samples. The MAPbI3 perovskite solar cell with 600 nm thick meso-IO scaffold exhibited the highest efficiency, which is consistent with reports in the literature.38,39 Moreover, we evaluated the stability of the cell by measuring JSC under a light soaking for 100 h (Fig. S3, ESI†), which indicates very stable output under illumination condition.
The 600 nm thick meso-IO scaffold exhibited remarkably small hysteresis of η, only 0.5% p. Specifically, the hysteresis with various delay times between the forward and reverse scan exhibits no hysteresis of η at delay times above 1000 ms (Fig. S4, ESI†). In our previous experiments, MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells using commercial mesoporous TiO2 scaffolds with 600 nm thickness exhibited a JSC value of 19.2 mA cm−2 and η value of 15.71%.40 The efficiency hysteresis between forward and reverse scan direction is 1.74% p. Thus, the meso-IO TiO2 scaffold exhibits much enhanced performance compared to the conventional scaffold. This improved photovoltaic performance of the meso-IO scaffold perovskite compared with the conventional solar scaffold may be attributed to minimal defects in the morphology of the meso-IO scaffold.
The increase in η with increasing thickness of the meso-IO scaffold is mainly due to the increase in JSC, as observed in Table 2. JSC values calculated from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of cells with meso-IO scaffolds having 400 nm, 500 nm, 600 nm, and 800 nm thicknesses are 18.4, 19.4, 20.2, and 20.9 mA cm−2, respectively, showing gradual saturation of JSC with increasing thickness (see Fig. 6a). This trend is similar to that of the measured JSC values listed in Table 2. Transmission spectra of solar cells using various MAPbI3/meso-IO scaffolds (Fig. 6b) suggest that as the thickness of the meso-IO scaffold increases and the transmittance above 600 nm gradually decreases, corresponding to a relatively low extinction coefficient of MAPbI3. This variation of the transmittance with the thickness is consistent with that of the EQE spectra. Thus, higher thickness enables harvesting of more light and an increase in JSC. The saturation of JSC above 600 nm thickness is caused by limited enhancement of light harvesting in the thick film.

V
OC of the mesoscopic MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells gradually decreases from 1.09 V to 1.05 V with the increasing thickness of the meso-IO scaffold, as observed in Table 2. This trend may be a result of the injection of electrons from the MAPbI3 perovskite layer into the meso-IO conductor, which dominates over charge transport in MAPbI3 perovskite, due to the potential drop.5,41 This may also be explained by ineffective extraction of holes in MAPbI3 into the thicker perovskite layer due to their limited diffusion length. Moreover, FF is markedly lowered for the 800 nm thick meso-IO scaffold. We also observed that the shunt resistance (Rsh) for the 800 nm thick scaffold is lower than those of other film thicknesses (Table 2). It has been revealed that a low Rsh is caused by incomplete coverage of perovskites.42,43 Hence, the thick meso-IO scaffold likely possessed cracks or defects, which leads to incomplete coverage of perovskites and low-resistance shunting paths, resulting in low FF. Analytical results for the photovoltaic parameters therefore suggest that the low η for the solar cells with 800 nm thick meso-IO scaffold is due to their low VOC and FF.
Experimental
Fabrication of the TiO2 meso-IO film
Polystyrene (PS) nanoparticles (∼100 nm diameter, 10 wt% dispersion in water; Bangs Laboratories, Inc.) were deposited on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate to form colloidal crystals. The dip-coating method using convective air flow at approximately 50 °C was applied. The coating rate was varied from 8 mm min−1 to 11 mm min−1 to control the thickness of the colloidal crystal film. The TiO2 precursor was deposited on the PS colloidal crystals by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and subsequently annealed at 500 °C for 2 h to remove the PS particles. For CVD, we utilized titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) and deionized water vapor as precursors, feeding them into the reactor using N2 gas. A chamber pressure of 0.55 Torr, exposure time of 15 s, and a purge time of 17 s were used throughout the deposition of both TiCl4 and water. A reactive-ion etching procedure using a mixture of CF4 and O2 was performed to remove the overcoat for 20 s. The sample was then post-treated with an aqueous 0.3 M TiCl4 solution for 30 min in a 70 °C oven and calcined in air at 450 °C for 30 min. For comparison, the mesoscopic NP film was prepared by spin coating of TiO2 paste (Dyesol DSL 18NR-T)-ethanol solution at 3000 rpm for 60 s and was then calcined at 450 °C for 15 min in air.
Fabrication of mesoscopic perovskite solar cells
To synthesize methyl ammonium iodide (MAI) powder, 50 mL of 57% hydroiodic acid aqueous solution (Aldrich) and 50 mL of 40% methylamine solution in methanol (Junsei Chemical) were allowed to react in a 250 mL round-bottom flask at 0 °C for 2 h under magnetic stirring. The precipitates were recovered by evaporation at 50 °C for 1 h. The products were then dissolved in ethanol, recrystallized from diethyl ether, and finally dried at room temperature in a vacuum oven for 24 h. A 1.2 M MAPbI3/dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) solution was prepared by mixing MAI powder and PbI2 at 1:1 mole ratio (Aldrich) with 1 mL of the solvent DMSO at 60 °C for 30 min. To fabricate mesoscopic MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells, the 1.2 M MAPbI3/DMSO solution was applied onto the TiO2 IO/blocking-layer TiO2 (bl-TiO2)/FTO substrates via the toluene dripping process. The TiO2 IO layers had 400 nm, 500 nm, 600 nm, and 800 nm thicknesses. During the spin-coating process (3000 rpm for 120 s), 0.1 mL of toluene was applied dropwise on the TiO2 IO/bl-TiO2/FTO substrates for 60 s. The perovskite was heated on a hot plate preset to 120 °C for 5 min in order to fully convert the MAPbI3–DMSO intermediate into MAPbI3 perovskite. The hole conductor, poly(triarylamine) (PTAA), was deposited onto the MAPbI3/mesoscopic TiO2/bl-TiO2/FTO substrate by spin-coating of PTAA/toluene (15:1 v/v), 7.5 μL lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide/acetonitrile (170:1 w/v), and 7.5 μL t-BP/acetonitrile (1:1 v/v) additive solutions at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, the Au counter electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation. The active area was fixed at 0.16 cm2.
Characterization
The morphologies of the meso-IO TiO2 film were observed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) using a Hitachi S-4700 microscope. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a TEM-3010 transmission electron microscope (JEOL). Defects in the TiO2 film were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; Theta Probe XPS system). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a power source (13014 ABET 150 W xenon lamp) with a monochromator (MonoRa-500i; Dongwoo Optron Co., Ltd.) and an IviumStat potentiostat (Ivium). J–V curves were obtained by illumination at 100 mA cm−2 AM 1.5G using a PEC-L01 solar simulator (Peccell) with an IviumStat potentiostat and a calibrated Si reference cell certified by the Japanese Industrial Standards. J–V curves for all devices were obtained by masking the active area (0.16 cm2) with a 0.096 cm2 metal mask.
Conclusion
We demonstrated the use of a meso-IO electron-conducting scaffold in mesoscopic MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells. The meso-IO film has interconnected pores throughout, which allow facile and complete infiltration of the MAPbI3 perovskite. The film thickness of the meso-IO scaffold was controlled and its effect on the photovoltaic performance was evaluated. As the thickness increased, the cells showed an increase in light harvesting and in JSC, along with a decrease in VOC and FF. The optimum thickness for the meso-IO scaffold was found to be 600 nm, which corresponds to a maximum η value of 17.1%, as well as an efficiency hysteresis between forward and reverse scans of 0.5% p for the solar cells. This efficiency and hysteresis is much higher than that of conventional mesoscopic TiO2 solar cells. Such an improvement may be caused by the fewer defects in the morphology of the meso-IO structure and fewer pinholes in the perovskite layer. On the basis of our results, we believe that the scaffolds presented here offer a new alternative for achieving solar cells with high stability and high efficiency.
