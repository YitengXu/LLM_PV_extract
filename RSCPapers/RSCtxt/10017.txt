    , Accepted 20th January 2021First published on 20th January 2021AbstractRecently, current–voltage (IV) hysteresis, which is more frequently observed in thin film perovskite solar cells, has been intensively studied due to the destruction of data accuracy in device measurement. Here, we investigated the effect of light illumination and temperature on IV hysteresis in single crystal CH3NH3PbI3 based lateral diodes. In the dark condition, the IV hysteresis is normal and decreases as the scan rate increases, which is related to relatively fast scans in our experiments. Even more interesting is that the reverse voltage scan curve intersects the forward voltage scan curve at a voltage Ucr under light illumination, dividing the IV hysteresis loop into two parts: inverted hysteresis (IH) part (lower voltage region) and normal hysteresis (NH) part (the higher voltage region). As the light intensity increases, the IH part expands while the NH part shrinks continuously. Interestingly, a complete cross over of the hysteresis from normal to inverted occurs at sufficiently high light intensities in the end. Furthermore, when the ambient temperature increases from 243 K to 343 K, the IV hysteresis continues to increase at first reaching a maximum value and then begins to decrease. It can be concluded that these phenomena are attributed to the competition between two mechanisms of ion migration and charge carrier trapping to de-trapping.
Introduction
The past several years have witnessed considerable interest in organic–inorganic halide perovskites, which are regarded as candidate materials for photovoltaic (PV) devices.1–4 Among them, methylammonium (MA) lead halide, CH3NH3PbX3 (MAPbX3, X = Cl, Br, I), perovskites have in particular attracted attention since their ongoing application as a light absorber in solar cells.5,6 In addition, they have been studied in great detail due to several outstanding properties including optimum direct band gap,6 excellent light absorption coefficient,7,8 and long carrier diffusion length.9,10 At present, perovskite materials are mainly produced as polycrystalline films using spin-coating methods. However, as the crystal synthesis technology continues to mature, single crystals are shown to exhibit more excellent photoelectric performance in device applications due to the following advantages. First, the abundant elimination of grain boundaries ensures less resistance to carrier transport in single crystalline photodetectors.11 Second, the dramatically reduced trap-state densities (nt) of single crystals can guarantee higher carrier mobility (hole μh and electron μe), longer diffusion length (L), and longer carrier lifetime (τ). Using MAPbI3 as an example, Dong et al. reported a solution-growth method to synthesize MAPbI3 single crystal, in which nt was as low as 3.6 × 1010 cm−3, and μh and μe exceeded 100 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 25 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, and τ reached 100 μs.12 Besides, the broader light-absorption wavelength ranges compared with the polycrystalline thin-film result in a wide spectral response in photodetectors.13 It is worth mentioning that the high-quality perovskite single crystals can be grown easily by multiple synthesis methods such as vapor-assisted crystallization,14 inverse temperature crystallization,15 and top-seed solution growth.12
Although both polycrystalline films and single crystals possess considerable advantages, the hysteresis issue with IV characteristics, especially for thin-films, has become an obstacle in the development of perovskite devices. The authenticity of equipment efficiency is suspected by scholars and in-depth research is being conducted.16–18 Generally speaking, hysteresis appears as a large fill factor (FF) that can be obtained in the reverse voltage scans by calculating high power conversion efficiency (PCE), while the FF value is smaller resulting in lower PCE performance in the forward voltage scans. In other words, the IV curves, which reflect PCE in the measurement of perovskite photovoltaic devices, are related to the scanning direction. According to previous literature, the IV hysteresis issue is also related to scanning speed; the faster the scanning speed, the greater the difference between reverse and forward scans.19
For the origin of IV hysteresis behavior, three mechanisms, namely: charge trapping,20 ion migration,21 and recombination at the interfaces or carrier extraction have been proposed in the literature.22,23 Charge trapping is considered to be a reasonable origin of IV hysteresis due to the large number of defects, which act as trap states in thin-film devices. Electrons and holes will be trapped by the trap states under forward-bias scan, and then will be released under reverse-bias scan. This slow charge trapping and de-trapping process may result in current delay, leading to the IV hysteresis.24 Shao et al. reduced the trap density by two orders of magnitude by depositing fullerenes on MAPbI3, which is effectively passivated by charge trap states.25 The successful elimination of photocurrent hysteresis indirectly proved that a charge trapping mechanism exists in perovskite devices. In terms of the ion-migration mechanism, negative and positive charged ionic vacancies may migrate under the influence of an external biasing field or ‘built-in’ potential of the device, which result in a net charge accumulation in certain regions of perovskite materials or at its contacts. Afterward, the change in vacancy concentration distribution produces a balanced internal diamagnetic field and acts on the electronic charge carriers, leading to IV hysteresis.26 In organolead trihalide perovskite (OTP)-based photovoltaic devices, Xiao et al. observed that the photocurrent direction can be switched repeatedly under a small electric field (<1 V μm−1). They attributed this abnormal phenomenon to the formation of reversible p-i-n structures induced by ionic migration in the perovskite layer.27 For the third mechanism, Jacobs et al. took a unique approach, focusing on electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), which provided a new explanation for IV hysteresis.23 In their research, it was shown that the hysteresis data could be rationalized by dividing AC current into two components: one part is related to charge-storage, and the other is related to the quasi-steady-state recombination current of electrons and holes.
As stated above, almost all IV hysteresis was observed in thin-film perovskite devices for further investigations, while similar phenomena in single-crystal perovskites have rarely been proposed. In this paper, we fabricated a lateral diode based on CH3NH3PbI3 single-crystal perovskite and the IV hysteresis was observed. Recording voltage scanning loops at different scan rates, we found that the IV hysteresis in our device decreased with increasing voltage scan rate, which is contrary to that in thin-film perovskites. Furthermore, the illumination-dependent measurement showed that the IV hysteresis loops were divided into two parts: the inverted hysteresis part in the lower voltage range, and the normal hysteresis part in the higher voltage range. Interestingly, a complete cross over from normal to inverted occurred at a sufficiently high light intensity. However, the IV hysteresis also had a certain temperature dependence with ambient temperature increasing from 243 K to 343 K. All of these can be attributed to the competition between two mechanisms of ion migration and charge carrier trapping to de-trapping.
Results and discussion
As shown in Fig. S2(a),† the observed diffraction peak positions indicated that the CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal was in a tetragonal phase, which is consistent with previously reported X-ray diffraction patterns.28–30 Besides, the UV-vis-NIR absorbance spectra are depicted in Fig. S2(b).† It is worth mentioning that the CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal displayed an absorption edge at ∼800 nm, from which the bandgap value was obtained as 1.47 eV by Tauc equation.31 Compared with the corresponding microcrystalline and thin-film materials,32,33 our single crystal exhibited a narrower bandgap and red shifted absorption edge, which are in good agreement with related studies.34–36
Effect of scan rates on IV hysteresis
A relatively simple lateral diode based on CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal was prepared for exploring the factors that affect IV hysteresis. First, the IV cycles measured at different scan rates indicated the dependence of IV hysteresis on the scan rate of voltage. As shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b), whether the sample was in the dark or under weak illumination (the light intensity is 0.036 mW cm−2), the current by reverse scan was always larger than that in the forward scan for a given voltage. This is also called normal IV hysteresis, which is similar to that observed in other devices such as standard perovskite thin film solar cells,37 and perovskite–PCBM hybrid film.38 It should be noted that during the measurement the IV hysteresis decreased gradually with the scan rate increasing from 400 to 8000 mV s−1. Therefore, a dimensionless parameter named hysteresis index (HI) was introduced to quantify the IV hysteresis effect. However, most definitions mainly focus on solar cells,39–43 which is not particularly suitable for general diodes. Thus, we gave a modified definition of HI in the later diodes: (1) ΔIm = Irm − Ifm = Ir(Um) − If(Um)(2) (3)where Ir and If denote the currents of reverse voltage scan and forward voltage scan, respectively, and Um represents the voltage at which the absolute value of current difference |Ir − If| is maximal. It is noted that as hysteresis is a dynamic process, a better suited definition of HI should be based on integral measures (i.e., areas of the current loop) instead of a given working point.44 From this aspect, it seems that the above method is not accurate enough to define HI. However, we found that the results are not sensitive to the particularities of HI definition in the data processing process. This in turn leads to a more understandable definition of a given working point. The detailed proof named “The Origin of HI Definition” is included in the ESI.†

As a result, the variation of HI with the scan rate of our sample was derived from eqn (1) to (3) and depicted in Fig. 1(c). It is clear that the HI ∼ scan rate dependence displayed a trend of monolithic decrease. What should be explained here is that ΔIm is the maximal difference between Ir and If, which is illustrated in Fig. 2. In the extreme case, where HI = 0, hysteresis does not exist in the device. However, when HI > 1, the devices will experience serious hysteresis.

Furthermore, there is one point to be emphasized that the relationship between scan rates and IV hysteresis is not consistent, but showed completely opposite results in different device tests. Similar to our results, Belisle et al. found that the hysteresis phenomenon in CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) was significantly serious at 0.2 V s−1 than that at 2 V s−1.45 Snaith et al. also found that the hysteresis got more extreme as the scan rate was reduced, and even at extremely slow scan rates there was still significant hysteresis.46 However, other studies reached the opposite conclusion that slow scan rates can suppress IV hysteresis. For example, Sanchez et al. proposed that HI will increase as the scan rate increases in CH3NH3PbI3−xClx based thin-film solar cells;39 Ungera et al. found that the IV hysteresis at the delay time of 0.01 s (high scan rate) was much larger than that at 5 s (low scan rate) in CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells.47 These completely opposite conclusions depend on the coverage of the scan rates, which were recorded by the researchers. In other words, the so-called fast scan rate and slow scan rate are relative. At this point, Nemnes et al. investigated the scan rates with wider coverage (5 mV s−1–100 V s−1), indicating that the hysteresis has a maximum for intermediate scan rates, while for very slow or very fast ones it decreases significantly.48 This is because slow bias scans are close to steady-state, while in very fast ones, the slow process of ion migration cannot follow the bias sweep. Therefore, we considered that the observed reduction of hysteresis may be due to relatively fast scanning.
Effect of light illumination on IV hysteresis
To further investigate the effect of light illumination, we recorded the IV curves at different light intensities, in which, the variation of incident light intensity (Pint) was realized by inserting neutral filters before the laser diode. As shown in Fig. 3(a), for weak light intensities, like Pint = 0.004 mW cm−2, the IV scan exhibited typical normal hysteresis, which was the same as the case in the dark. However, for Pint ≥ 0.323 mW cm−2, an intersection between forward and reverse scanning IV curves occurred. The voltage at this crossing was defined as Ucr, dividing the IV hysteresis loop into two parts: the inverted hysteresis (IH) part (the lower voltage region), and the normal hysteresis (NH) part (the higher voltage region). As the light intensity increases, Ucr shifts towards a high voltage direction as shown in Fig. 3(b). Moreover, the IH part expanded while the NH part shrank constantly, and finally, a complete cross-over of IV hysteresis from normal to inverted occurred at sufficiently high light intensities. Similar hysteresis phenomena involving the crossing between reverse scan curve and forward scan curve were observed in planar perovskite solar cells and thin-film perovskite absorber devices.49 However, the authors did not elaborate on the reasons for this phenomenon. Apart from this, Ravishankar et al. also found that the intersection curves could occur at low forward or reverse bias.50

(b) The shift of Ucr with increasing Pint. (c) The dependences of hysteresis index on the incident light intensity, where HIi is the inverted hysteresis (IH) part, HIn is the normal hysteresis (NH) part and HItot is the total hysteresis, which equals the algebraic sum of HIi and HIn. 
For this case where reverse scan curves cross with forward scan curves, the previous definition of HI is not enough to express IV hysteresis effect. Therefore, the re-modified HI was as follows: HItot = HIi + HIn(4) (5) ΔImi = Irmi − Ifmi = Iri(Umi) − Ifi(Umi)(6) (7) (8) ΔImn = Irmn − Ifmn = Irn(Umn) − Ifn(Umn)(9) (10)where HItot is the algebraic sum of two parts: one is HIi in the IH area, another is HIn in the NH area. As for the other parameters, they are similar to before: in the IH part, Ifi and Iri respectively, denote the currents of forward voltage scan and reverse voltage scan; and Umi represents the voltage at which the absolute value of current difference |Ifi − Iri| is maximum. However, in the NH part, the definition of parameters is the same, the only difference is whether the location is in the IH area or NH area. As illustrated in Fig. 4, for the case where ΔImn = 0 or ΔImi = 0, eqn (4) is reduced to eqn (1). Therefore, eqn (4) to (10) can be regarded as the extensions of eqn (1) to (3). The calculated dependences of HIn, HIi and HItot on the incident light intensity are displayed in Fig. 3(c), in which the expansion of IH, the contraction of NH and the crossover of HItot from normal to inverted have been clearly demonstrated.

For perovskite solar cells, the observed hysteresis is considered to be caused by imbalanced charge extraction at two critical interfaces that are based on experimental results and numerical simulations.51,52 However, in a single crystal that we investigated, the cross over from NH to IH under light illumination is coincident with the ionic transport picture. Under the influence of applied voltage, an electric dipole moment will be developed as schematically shown in Fig. 5(a). Thus, by the forward voltage scan (anode being positively biased with respect to cathode), the negatively charged anions migrated towards the anode while the positively charged ions to the cathode, which forms negative space charges near the anode and positive space charges near the cathode, respectively. Afterward, the polarized charge distribution formed an electric dipole moment Pion, with its direction pointing to the cathode, which lowered the local electric field, resulting in a lowered current. As the applied voltage suddenly returned, the change in its direction will lag behind the external electric field. However, Pion strengthened the local electric field at this time, leading to enhanced current. Therefore, the IV curve exhibits normal hysteresis as we can observe.
 Fig. 5  Schematic diagram of the development of electric dipole moment due to ion migration along the channel (a) and polarized space distribution of photogenerated charge carriers (b). It is to note that the injection of electrons from the cathode and holes from the anode into the perovskite is absent in the diagrams for clarity. 
As shown in Fig. 5(b), illuminating the device under low voltage biasing, an additional electric dipole moment will be formed as a result of photo charge generation. In addition, in the region near the cathode, the photogenerated holes were quickly collected by the cathode under light illumination, leaving electrons, which slowly moved towards the anode, forming negative space charges there. Similarly, in the region near the anode, the photogenerated electrons were connected by the anode, resulting in holes moving towards the cathode and forming positive space charges there. Here, we considered that the polarized charge carrier equals the dipole moment Pphc directed to the cathode, that is, in opposite direction to Pion. Considering the two effects, the effective dipole moment Peff can be expressed as Peff = Pion − Pphc, where Pion increased with the scan voltage, while Pphc with light intensity. Therefore, Pion > Pphc, Peff > 0 at a large scan voltage and weak light intensity, making IV characteristic exhibit normal hysteresis. However, at a low voltage and high light intensity, Pion < Pphc, Peff < 0, which forced the IV characteristic to exhibit reverse hysteresis.
Effect of temperature on IV hysteresis
To the best of our knowledge, the temperature of the test equipment will have a certain impact on the device performance, and the IV hysteresis is no exception. For example, the hysteresis dependence on temperature in MAPbI3 solar cells controlled by ion migration/accumulation at the interface was studied by Levine et al.53 The curves presented in Fig. 6(a) manifested that the dark current increased gradually with increasing ambient temperature (243 K to 343 K). It should be emphasized that in order to facilitate the observation, the red dotted line (temperature from 243 K to 283 K) in Fig. 6(a) was extracted into Fig. 6(c). Furthermore, according to the previous definition of HI, the dependence on temperature was shown in Fig. 6(b). It is clear that HI rose continually at first until the temperature reached 313 K and then decreased, which is quite different from that observed in thin film PSCs. For instance, Meloni et al. found that HI decreased with temperature in CH3NH3PbX3 thin film PSCs with the temperature ranging from −15 °C to 20 °C.54
 Fig. 6  The IV hysteresis at different temperatures (a), and the dependence of HI on the temperature (b). (c) The IV hysteresis corresponding to the red frame line in (a), in which the curve represents specific situations below room temperature. 
The evolution of HI on temperature can be explained in the picture of ion migration and charge trapping. As the ion migration is temperature activated, it is reasonable to assume that the IV hysteresis based on ion migration enhances with increasing temperature. However, as the escape probability increases with temperature, it is expected that the IV hysteresis will decrease with temperature. Thus, with these factors in mind, the temperature evolution of HI presented in Fig. 6(b) could be considered as the result of competition between two physical mechanisms of IV hysteresis under the influence of the applied electric field. At low temperatures, the ion migration mechanism, that is, the imbalanced migration speed of negative charge and positive charge ions, dominates. However, at high temperatures, the charge trapping and de-trapping mechanism becomes dominant. The former strengthens while the latter weakens with increasing temperature.
Experimental
CH3NH3I synthesis
CH3NH3I was synthesized by mixing 100 mL of absolute alcohol, 24 mL of methylamine (CH3NH2) (33 wt% in absolute ethanol, Sigma-Aldrich Ltd) and 10 mL of hydroiodic acid (58 wt% in water, Sigma-Aldrich Ltd) in a 250 mL round-bottom flask at 0 °C for 2 to 5 h with stirring. Three points are to be noted; i) nitrogen (N2) atmosphere was maintained to prevent hydroiodic acid from being oxidized. ii) CH3NH2 was slightly in excess to ensure that hydroiodic acid reacted completely. iii) N2 was first introduced for 5 min before the synthesis of CH3NH3I. Hereafter, white crystals of CH3NH3I were recovered by placing the solution on an electric heating sleeve at 80 °C and re-crystallizing in 100 mL ether for 3 to 5 times. Lastly, the solid was collected after drying at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 2 h.
CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal and photodetector fabrication
For CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal synthesis, a pale gold color precursor was synthesized by dissolving 2.6 g CH3NH3I and 6.8 g PbI2 in 12 mL GBL at 65 °C and stirring for 2 h. Then, 2.5 mL of the precursor was maintained at 90 °C in an oven for 5 h, which assured a suitable crystallization. In this process, black seed crystals continuously precipitated until the amount stopped increasing. This meant that the solution was no longer supersaturated and seed crystals with better appearance need to be selected as new precursor to continue growing into larger-size crystals. As a result, CH3NH3PbI3 single crystals were obtained after drying with N2 and immersed in ether or toluene. Photodetector fabrication and schematic diagram are detailed in Fig. S1.†
Device characterization
The sample was immediately transferred into a vacuum chamber with a rotary pump vacuum (∼10 Pa) after device preparation; the current–voltage characteristics were then measured by utilizing the automatic semiconductor characterization system. For the measurements of illumination effects, a red laser diode with 650 nm wavelength was used, in which the variation of optical power from 0.004 mW cm−2 to 65.098 mW cm−2 was realized by inserting neutral filters of various transmittances before the laser diode. The test ambient temperature (243 K to 343 K) was controlled by a semiconductor characterization system under dark. It is worth mentioning that other factors, such as scan rates, can be also changed by the automatic characterization system to enhance the operability of our experiment.
Conclusions
In conclusion, IV hysteresis in a lateral diode based on CH3NH3PbI3 single-crystal perovskite was investigated. In the dark condition, the IV hysteresis is normal, and HI decreased as scan rates increased. However, under light illumination, the reverse scan curve intersected the forward scan curve at a voltage Ucr, dividing the IV scan loop into two parts: the inverse hysteresis part (lower voltage region, 0 ∼ Ucr), and the normal hysteresis part (the higher voltage region, Ucr ∼ Umax). Interestingly, as the light intensity increased, the intersect voltage, Ucr shifted towards higher voltages, that is, the IH part expanded while the NH part shrank. Finally, a complete cross over to IH occurred at sufficiently high light intensities. On the other hand, the IV hysteresis increased at first reaching a maximum value, then decreased with the ambient temperature increasing from a low temperature. It is suggested that the phenomena were attributed to the competition between two mechanisms of ion migration and charge carrier trapping or de-trapping.

 	Fig. 1  
IV hysteresis at different scan rates (a) in the dark and (b) under light illumination of 650 nm wavelength, 0.036 mW cm−2 intensity. (c) The dependence of HI on the voltage scan rates.	 

 	Fig. 2  Schematic diagram of the definitions of Um, Ir(Um) and max(|Ir − If|) in eqn (1)–(3).	 

 	Fig. 3  The relationship between IV hysteresis and incident light intensity (Pint) under constant scanning delay (10 ms). (a) I–V characteristics under different incident light intensity. (b) The shift of Ucr with increasing Pint. (c) The dependences of hysteresis index on the incident light intensity, where HIi is the inverted hysteresis (IH) part, HIn is the normal hysteresis (NH) part and HItot is the total hysteresis, which equals the algebraic sum of HIi and HIn.	 
HItot = HIi + HIn	(4)
	(5)
ΔImi = Irmi − Ifmi = Iri(Umi) − Ifi(Umi)	(6)
	(7)
	(8)
ΔImn = Irmn − Ifmn = Irn(Umn) − Ifn(Umn)	(9)
	(10)

 	Fig. 4  Schematic diagram of the definitions of Umi, Umn, max (|Ifi − Iri|) and max (|Ifn − Irn|) in eqn (4) to (10).	 

 	Fig. 5  Schematic diagram of the development of electric dipole moment due to ion migration along the channel (a) and polarized space distribution of photogenerated charge carriers (b). It is to note that the injection of electrons from the cathode and holes from the anode into the perovskite is absent in the diagrams for clarity.	 

 	Fig. 6  The IV hysteresis at different temperatures (a), and the dependence of HI on the temperature (b). (c) The IV hysteresis corresponding to the red frame line in (a), in which the curve represents specific situations below room temperature.
