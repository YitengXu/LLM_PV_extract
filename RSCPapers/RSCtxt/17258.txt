    , Accepted 7th September 2017First published on 28th September 2017AbstractA photocathode prepared using the photocatalyst (ZnSe)0.85(CuIn0.7Ga0.3Se2)0.15 in powder form, and modified with CdS/ZnS overlayers and a Pt catalyst, exhibits a photocurrent of 4.3 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight. The photocathode was capable of utilizing photons up to 900 nm, while the onset potential was evaluated to be as high as 0.8 VRHE. Modification with thin CdS and ZnS layers significantly increases the cathodic photocurrent through the formation of a surface p–n junction. The half-cell solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 0.83% at 0.33 VRHE obtained from this device is among the highest yet reported for a photocathode fabricated from a particulate photocatalyst. A solar to hydrogen conversion efficiency of 0.60% was observed during bias-free overall water splitting using this photocathode together with a BiVO4 photoanode. The present work clearly demonstrates the possibility of efficient hydrogen generation using durable particulate semiconductor photoelectrodes.
Introduction
The production of solar hydrogen from water splitting has been extensively studied as an attractive means of generating a clean, storable and renewable chemical fuel. Since photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting using TiO2 photoanodes was demonstrated by Fujishima and Honda in 1972,1 various photoelectrode materials have been developed for the efficient conversion of solar energy to hydrogen.2–5 Theoretically, the maximum photocurrent of photoelectrodes increases with decreasing band gap energy because of the increased absorption of sunlight. However, PEC water splitting proceeds via photoexcited carriers that are driven to the solid–liquid interface by an electric field in the vicinity of the junction, representing a depletion layer. Forming a depletion layer that efficiently promotes charge separation becomes more challenging as the band gap energy decreases.
Several semiconductor photocathodes, such as Si, InP and CuIn0.7Ga0.3Se2,6–8 have been reported to exhibit cathodic photocurrents as high as >30 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE under irradiation with sunlight. PEC water splitting cells using these photocathodes with the assistance of photovoltaic modules exhibit relatively high solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency (STH) values.2–5 However, recent technoeconomic analyses have determined that it will be difficult to construct cost-feasible systems based on PV-assisted water splitting.9 Thus, the development of bias-free PEC cells is essential for the practical implementation of solar hydrogen generation. The record STH of bias-free PEC cells is ∼0.9%,10–14 which is still 1 order of magnitude lower than that of the state-of-the-art systems based on PEC and photovoltaic-powered water splitting.
To drive bias-free PEC water splitting efficiently, the development of photocathodes with a high cathodic photocurrent at enough positive potential is essential, because the working potential is determined by matching the photocurrents of a photocathode and a photoanode. Recently, Kaneko et al. demonstrated the thin films of (ZnSe)0.85(CuIn0.7Ga0.3Se2)0.15, herein abbreviated as (ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15, as a promising photocathode for PEC water splitting.14,15 This material absorbs light up to approximately 900 nm, and the cathodic onset potential is as high as 0.89 VRHE. Photocurrents up to 12 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE have been obtained from thin films prepared by modified co-evaporation in conjunction with a bilayer method.15 Moreover, the amounts of the expensive metals In and Ga that are required are reduced compared to Cu(In,Ga)Se2, by forming a solid solution with ZnSe. As a result of these unique characteristics, (ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15 shows promise as a component of efficient PEC water splitting cells without an external bias voltage. Bias-free PEC cells with a record STH of ∼0.9% were reported using this photocathode and a BiVO4 photoanode.14
To date, (ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15 thin film photocathodes have been fabricated using a vacuum co-evaporation process.14,15 Although high-performance photocathodes can be prepared with this technique, scale-up is challenging because the material is synthesized under nonequilibrium conditions. The fabrication of photoelectrodes from powdered materials is an alternative approach that is potentially more scalable and economically feasible. As an example, photoelectrodes prepared using SrTiO3 powder showed comparable photocurrents and onset potentials to those of a photoelectrode prepared from a single crystal wafer.16 However, the photocurrents of particulate Cu–Ga–Se chalcopyrite photocathodes have been found to be limited to 2.2 and 0.2 mA cm−2 at 0 and 0.3 VRHE, respectively.17 Although modified La5Ti2CuS5O7 photocathodes have been reported to show a relatively high onset potential of 0.9 VRHE, the associated photocurrent is only 1.4 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE and the absorption edge is limited to 700 nm.18
The present work demonstrated the PEC properties of photocathodes composed of (ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15 powder. A photocathode modified with CdS/ZnS overlayers and a Pt catalyst generated photocurrents of 4.3 and 2.7 mA cm−2 at 0 and 0.3 VRHE, respectively, under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight. The photocathode was capable of utilizing photons up to 900 nm, while the onset potential was evaluated to be 0.8 VRHE. The half-cell solar to hydrogen conversion efficiency (HC-STH) of this unit was 0.83% at 0.33 VRHE, a value that is one of the highest ever reported for a particulate photocatalyst photocathode. In addition, a bias-free overall water splitting STH of 0.60% was obtained when employing the photocathode together with a BiVO4 photoanode.
Experimental section
Preparation of (ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15 powder
Particulate (ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15 was prepared by the flux method in a sealed quartz ampoule. Prior to this synthesis, fine ZnSe particles were obtained by ball-milling of commercially available ZnSe dispersed in ethanol. The ball-milled ZnSe was subsequently mixed with Cu2Se, In2Se3, Ga2Se3, Se, LiCl and KCl in a nitrogen-filled glovebox in the molar ratios of 1.7:0.21:0.105:0.045:0.01:6:4. This mixture was equivalent to Zn/(Zn + In + Ga), Ga/(In + Ga) and Cu/(In + Ga) molar ratios of 0.85, 0.3 and 1.4. The mixture was sealed in a quartz ampoule and heated at 500 °C for 10 h, after which the (ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15 was separated from the chloride flux by washing with distilled water.
Preparation of (ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15 photocathodes
A (ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15 photoelectrode was subsequently fabricated by a particle transfer method.19 In this process, 50 mg of the (ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15 powder was dispersed in 1 mL of isopropanol by ultrasonication for 30 min, after which the suspension was dropped onto a glass substrate to form layers of (ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15 photocatalytic particles. Following this, a metallic Mo or C contact layer was deposited by radio frequency magnetron sputtering (MNS-2000, Ulvac) at 200 °C, followed by the deposition of a Ti conductor layer. The deposition conditions for these metal layers are summarized in Table S1.† Subsequently, the (ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15/M/Ti assembly (where M = Mo or C) was bound to a secondary glass plate by using carbon tape, and then peeled away from the primary glass plate. Finally, excess particles were removed by ultrasonication in distilled water. Prior to the following surface modifications, the electrode surface was etched using an aqueous solution containing 0.1 M KCN and 0.8 M KOH for 1 min.
Modification with CdS and ZnS overlayers
The electrode thus fabricated was modified with a layer of CdS and/or ZnS using chemical bath deposition (CBD) in order to form a p–n junction at the solid–liquid interface. The CBD of CdS was performed with 50 mL of an aqueous solution containing 25 mM Cd(CH3COO)2, 0.375 M SC(NH2)2 and 14 wt% ammonia as precursors. During the deposition period of 14 min, the bath temperature was increased to approximately 53 °C. The ZnS layer was applied in the same manner, but using Zn(CH3COO)2 as the precursor. Following CBD, each specimen was annealed at 200 °C for 1 h in air.
Modification with Pt as a hydrogen evolution catalyst
Pt particles acting as a hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst were deposited on the electrodes by photoassisted electro-deposition using a three-electrode system. The electrodes were irradiated with a solar simulator (SAN-EI Electric, XES-40S2-CE) that generated AM 1.5G radiation at 100 mW cm−2 in an aqueous solution containing 10 μM H2PtCl6, 50 μM NaOH and 0.1 M Na2SO4, at a potential of −0.3 V versus Ag/AgCl until a saturated photocurrent was obtained. A typical current–time curve during Pt deposition is shown in Fig. S1.†
Preparation of NiFeOx-Bi/BiVO4 photoanodes
The details of the preparation process of BiVO4 have been described elsewhere.20 Briefly, BiVO4 electrodes were prepared on ITO substrates (Geomatec-0051, 5 Ω sq−1) by electrodeposition of precursors followed by annealing in air. The annealing temperature was first raised to 320 °C at a ramp rate of 1 °C min−1, then to 450 °C at a ramp rate of 2 °C min−1, and was finally held at 450 °C for 1 h. As an oxygen evolution reaction catalyst, Ni-(oxy)hydroxide/borate (NiFeOx-Bi) was deposited on the BiVO4 photoanodes by photoassisted electrodeposition.21
Characterization
The purity of samples was examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD; Miniflex, Rigaku). Structural morphology was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM; S-8020, Hitachi), transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEM-2800, JEOL and Cs-STEM; JEM-ARM200F Thermal FE single SDD, JEOL), and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM; JEM-2800, JEOL) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS; X-MAX 100TLE SDD detector, Oxford Instruments). The absorption edge was determined using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS; V-670DS, JASCO). The chemical composition of the surface was evaluated using X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS). Ionization potential was determined using photoemission spectroscopy in air (PESA; AC-3, Riken Keiki).
Photoelectrochemical measurements
A three-electrode setup was typically used to characterize the PEC properties of the photocathodes. A Pt wire and an Ag/AgCl electrode in saturated aqueous KCl solution were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The measurements were performed under an Ar atmosphere using an aqueous solution of 1.0 M potassium phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0) as the electrolyte, with the potential being expressed relative to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). A solar simulator (SAN-EI Electric, XES-40S2-CE) producing AM 1.5G simulated sunlight was employed as the light source in the current–potential measurements. The wavelength dependence of the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was evaluated under monochromatic light from a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with a monochromator (CT-10, JASCO). The light intensity was measured using a calibrated Si photodiode (S2281-01, Hamamatsu Photonics). Analysis of the evolved gas was conducted using an airtight three-electrode or two-electrode cell connected to a gas chromatograph (3000 Micro GC Gas Analyzer, Agilent Technologies). Prior to the measurements, the cells were purged with Ar gas. A solar simulator (SAN-EI Electric, XES-70S1) was used to produce AM 1.5G simulated sunlight. The amounts of evolved H2 and O2 were measured by gas chromatography, while simultaneously monitoring the photocurrent using a potentiostat or an ammeter.
Results and discussion
The XRD pattern of the synthesized (ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15 is shown in Fig. S2.† Almost all the diffraction peaks can be assigned to a zincblende phase, indicating that the specimen was a solid solution of ZnSe and CIGS. Assuming a zincblende-type structure, the lattice constant was calculated to be 0.56821(8) nm, which is consistent with the value previously reported for a (ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15 thin film.14Fig. 1(a) and (b) show the SEM images of the electrode. In the overhead image, μm-sized (ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15 particles can be seen on the surface, while the cross-section exhibits several aggregated primary particles firmly stacked on the metal back contact layer. The electrode was further characterized by TEM, and Fig. 1(c)–(f) present the STEM image and the associated EDS mapping data of the (ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15 modified with CdS and ZnS (ZnS/CdS/(ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15). These data demonstrate that an approximately 50 nm-thick CdS layer covered the (ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15 particles. In addition, a ZnS layer with a thickness of several nm covered the CdS layer, as shown in Fig. 1(d) and (g). A high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image of the CdS/(ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15 interface is depicted in Fig. 1(h). A continuous lattice fringe corresponding to (111) and (112) planes in zincblende- and chalcopyrite-type structures in the (ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15 is observed, indicating that each of the primary particles was composed of a single crystal. This image also demonstrates that the primary CdS particles (approximately 10 nm in size) were epitaxially grown along the (111) planes on the (ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15.

Fig. 2(a) plots the current density values obtained from (ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15/Mo/Ti modified with Pt, Pt/CdS and Pt/ZnS/CdS under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight against potential. The Pt-modified (ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15 (Pt/(ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15) showed a cathodic photocurrent density of 0.5 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE in conjunction with an onset potential of approximately 0.2 VRHE. In the case of the Pt/CdS/(ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15, the photocurrent density was increased to 2.5 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE with an onset potential in the vicinity of 0.7 VRHE. It has been reported that an n-type CdS layer promotes charge separation by forming a p–n junction at the solid–liquid interface with the underlying p-type layer, resulting in a larger photocurrent and a higher onset potential.14,22 Additional modification with ZnS (Pt/ZnS/CdS/(ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15) further increased the photocurrent density to 4.3 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE. The photocathodic onset potential was evaluated to be ca. 0.8 VRHE. This onset potential is comparable to that of the thin film electrode of the same materials.14,15 It should be noted that the photocurrent in the vicinity of the onset potential was hindered by a dark current, which could be suppressed by applying an alternative contact layer, as described below. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the HC-STH of this device reached 0.83% at 0.33 VRHE. This value is one of the highest ever reported for a particulate photocathode. Fig. 2(c) shows the IPCE spectrum of Pt/ZnS/CdS/(ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15 as measured at 0 VRHE. The IPCE value was 25% at 350 nm and the photocathode was capable of utilizing photons up to ca. 900 nm, which is consistent with the absorption edge determined by DRS (see Fig. S3†).

Mo was used as a contact layer and a 1.0 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7) was employed as the electrolyte. 
Current versus time plots for Pt/ZnS/CdS/(ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15 at 0 and 0.4 VRHE are presented in Fig. 3(a). The decreases in the photocurrent at both potentials were less than 10% over an irradiation period of 1 h, which is comparable to the results reported for chalcopyrite-type thin film photocathodes.14,22 Gas production analysis was performed to examine the faradaic efficiency of each photocathode. Fig. 3(b) depicts the amounts of hydrogen and oxygen evolved during PEC water splitting with the Pt/ZnS/CdS/(ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15 at an applied potential of 0 VRHE. The total amounts of evolved gases were in agreement with the quantities estimated based on the current passing through the cell and assuming a faradaic efficiency of unity. This result confirmed that the photocurrents were associated with PEC hydrogen evolution.

The dashed lines show the amounts of H2 and O2 expected at a faradaic efficiency of unity. The geometric area of the photocathode was 0.3 cm2 and a 1.0 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7) was used as the electrolyte. 
To assess the effect of the ZnS layer, band alignments at the solid–liquid interface were calculated on the basis of Poisson's equation. From Fig. 4, it is evident that the depletion layer thicknesses at the solid–liquid interfaces were 250 and 230 nm for the ZnS/CdS/(ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15 and CdS/(ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15, respectively, at 0 VRHE. Thus, the increased photocurrent resulting from ZnS and CdS deposition can likely be attributed to an increase in the thickness of the depletion layer formed at the solid–liquid interface, which promotes charge separation. Although the conduction band minimum of ZnS is more negative than that of CdS and therefore a spike-type band offset was obtained,23,24 there was only a minimal drop in electron transfer from the photocathode to the electrolyte because the ZnS layer thickness was evidently at the nm-scale. Another possible effect of ZnS deposition is the partial substitution of Zn atoms for Cd, although a detailed analysis of such a substitution is beyond the scope of the present study. We note that the photocurrent generated by the Pt/CdS/(ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15 decayed rapidly with reaction time even at an applied potential of 0 VRHE, as shown in Fig. S9.† However, the initial photocurrent density was recovered after a brief cessation of irradiation. This result suggests that the photocurrent decay was not due to the degradation of the photocathode but rather due to mass transfer limitations. Indeed, both the retention and growth of bubbles were observed on the Pt/CdS/(ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15 surface during irradiation, but not on the ZnS/CdS-modified electrodes. These observations are suggestive of incidental contribution of ZnS modification to the prompt release of evolved hydrogen. We examined the water contact angles of CdS coated and ZnS/CdS coated electrodes to clarify the effect on the wettability of these surface modifications. The water contact angles were evaluated to be 130° for CdS coated and 134° for ZnS/CdS coated electrodes, with an uncertainty of approximately 2°. These results suggest that wettability was almost unchanged by these surface modifications. However, because water contact angles are sensitive to surface properties, as exemplified by the Lotus effect, a well-defined and well-developed surface is required for a detailed analysis of wettability through the measurements. Furthermore, the measurement conditions were distinctly different from those of actual reaction conditions during PEC hydrogen evolution, including the illumination of sunlight.25 Further study will be required to clarify the mass transfer properties of these electrodes.
 Fig. 4  Calculated band alignments at the solid–liquid interfaces for (a and b) ZnS/CdS/(ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15 and (c) CdS/(ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15 electrodes at an applied potential of 0 VRHE. CBM, VBM, and EF represent the conduction band minimum, valence band maximum, and Fermi level, respectively. The difference between the CBM and EF of ZnS or CdS and that between the VBM and EF of (ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15 were assumed to be 0.2 eV. The flat band potentials of ZnS and CdS were set to −0.69 and −0.22 VRHE, respectively.23,24 Parameters used for calculation are listed in Table S2.† 
Conventionally, chalcopyrite-type thin films have been fabricated using Mo as a back contact because MoSe2 generated at the interface assists in obtaining an ohmic contact.26 However, the photocathode with a Mo contact layer prepared in this study exhibited a dark current at positive potentials, which hinders the photocurrent in the vicinity of the onset potential (see Fig. 2(a)). This dark current was most likely due to the oxidation of the Mo and/or MoSe2 contact layers, and we found that it could be suppressed by using an alternative contact layer. As shown in Fig. 5, the photocathode fabricated using a C contact layer produced a higher photocurrent above 0.5 VRHE than was obtained with a Mo contact layer, primarily because of the suppression of the dark current. However, the photocathode with a C contact layer generated a lower photocurrent at 0 VRHE compared to that with a Mo contact layer, most likely as a result of the lower electrical conductivity of C compared to Mo.

Finally, we demonstrated PEC overall water splitting using a Pt/ZnS/CdS/(ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15/C/Ti photocathode and a BiVO4 photoanode modified with a NiFeOx-Bi catalyst (NiFeOx-Bi/BiVO4). These photoelectrodes were positioned side-by-side and illuminated with AM 1.5G simulated sunlight without an external bias voltage. Here, we used a weakly basic borate buffer solution that is a suitable electrolyte for the NiFeOx-Bi/BiVO4 photoanode. Pt/ZnS/CdS/(ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15/C/Ti can produce the comparable photocurrent in this buffer solution as in a neutral phosphate buffer solution. As shown in Fig. 6(a), an appreciable overlap between these anodic and cathodic photocurrents with an intersecting potential of 0.45 VRHE was confirmed, indicating a possible induction of bias-free PEC water splitting. Fig. 6(b) shows the time course of the photocurrent generated by the two-electrode cell. The STH value based on the initial photocurrent after 1 min of irradiation was found to be 0.60%. However, the photocurrent decayed rapidly, primarily due to the degradation of the Pt/ZnS/CdS/(ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15 in the weakly basic borate buffer solution (pH 9.5). The XPS spectra of Pt/ZnS/CdS/(ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15 before and after the PEC overall water splitting reaction are shown in Fig. S11,† and the surface composition estimated using XPS is listed in Table S3.† The XPS spectrum of the O 1s peak after the overall water splitting reaction showed a shoulder at around 529.9 eV, which was a characteristic in O2− ions in the ZnO lattice.27 These results suggest that the surface ZnS was oxidized into ZnO during the PEC overall water splitting reaction. The surface modification with a stable oxide layer, such as TiO2, is a promising approach to stabilize the photocathode under these reaction conditions.28–30 It should be noted that stacked geometry, namely tandem-type PEC cell, is favorable for higher STH because of smaller land mass with respect to side-by-side geometry. However, the IPCE value of the present photocathodes is not sufficient beyond 520 nm, which is an absorption edge of the BiVO4 photoanode, to construct efficient tandem-type PEC cells. The development of the (ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15 photocathode with a higher IPCE at >520 nm is envisioned via the optimization of the sample preparation procedure, the electrode fabrication process, and the surface modification.

Conclusions
In summary, this work demonstrated PEC hydrogen evolution from water using a photocathode made from (ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15 powder. The particulate (ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15 was synthesized by a flux method in a sealed quartz ampoule, after which a photocathode was fabricated by particle transfer. Micrometer-sized aggregates of (ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15 particles were firmly stacked on the back contact layer. HR-TEM observations revealed that part of the CdS layer was epitaxially grown on the (ZnSe)0.85(CIGS)0.15. Both EDS and XPS analyses indicated that a ZnS layer several nm in thickness was deposited on the outer surface. The photocathode modified with a CdS/ZnS overlayers and a Pt catalyst exhibited a photocurrent of 4.3 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight. The onset potential was evaluated to be 0.8 VRHE, while the band gap value was as narrow as 1.4 eV. The STH value achieved during overall water splitting without an external bias voltage was 0.60% using the photocathode with a BiVO4 photoanode. The present work clearly demonstrates the possibility of efficient hydrogen generation using durable particulate semiconductor photocathodes.
