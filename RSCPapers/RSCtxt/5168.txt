    , Accepted 27th November 2022First published on 29th November 2022Abstractvan der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs), with their flexible combination of various two-dimensional (2D) materials, are continuously revealing new physics and functionalities. 2D magnetic materials have recently become a focus due to their fascinating electronic and spintronic properties. However, there has rarely been any investigation of the optical properties of 2D magnetic materials-based heterostructures. Herein, we construct a new WSe2/FePS3 heterostructure, in which WSe2 works as a “sensor” to visualize the thickness-dependent properties of FePS3. As characterized by photoluminescence (PL) spectra, whether under or on top of the FePS3, the PL intensity of the monolayer WSe2 is strongly quenched. The quenching effect becomes more obvious as the FePS3 thickness increases. This is because of the efficient charge transfer process occurring at the WSe2/FePS3 interface with type II band alignment, which is faster for thicker FePS3, as is evident from transient absorption measurements. The thickness-dependent charge transfer process and corresponding excitonic properties are further revealed in low-temperature photoluminescence spectra of WSe2/FePS3 heterostructures. Our results show that the thickness of 2D magnetic materials can work as an experimental tuning knob to manipulate the optical performance of conventional 2D semiconductors, endowing van der Waals heterostructures with more unexpected properties and functionalities.
Introduction
Over the last decade, an upsurge of research on two-dimensional (2D) materials has emerged due to their remarkable properties and enormous potential in scalable device applications.1,2 As a milestone work, the successful exfoliation of graphene provided new experimental and theoretical support for the expansion of the 2D materials family.2 Thereafter, a series of graphene-like materials were fabricated, such as silicene,3 phosphorene,4 transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs)5 and so on. These 2D materials with different elements exhibit versatile physical and chemical properties, which confer on them broad application prospects in photodetectors,6 light-emitting diodes,7 light modulators8 and ultra-fast lasers.9
Another research topic of great interest associated with 2D materials is the development of van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) by combining two or more of them. Since lattice matching is no longer a limiting factor due to vdW assembly, a large number of materials can be chosen to form multilayered structures with certain desired properties. For example, various vdWHs based on 2D materials, such as MoS2/WS2,10 Bi2Se3/MoTe2,11 WSe2/CrI3,12 GaTe/MoS213 and so on, have been successfully designed for field effect transistors (FETs),14 solar cells,15 photodetectors,16 memory devices,17 sensors18 and other electronic devices. In short, vdWHs demonstrate outstanding features beyond their individual components, which can play a vital role in the extension of electronic degrees of freedom and the development of well-performing devices.
In recent years, the 2D materials family has revealed increasingly new physical properties and device functions as further exploration continues of new members of 2D materials. In particular, the association of materials with magnetism ensures they have broader application prospects in spintronics,19 sensitive detection,20 low dissipation transmission,21 and so on. 2D magnetic materials have become the focus of research since the discovery of intrinsic 2D ferromagnetism in atomically thin CrI3 and Cr2Ge2Te6 crystals. Soon after, a rich variety of 2D magnetic materials have been grown and explored. For example, intrinsic 2D magnetism has been confirmed in other vdW materials involving Fe3GeTe2,22 Cr2Ge2Te6,23 MnBi2Te4,24 FePS3,25 and so on. Their emergence has been at the frontier of materials research, providing an ideal platform for understanding the fundamentals of 2D magnetism and engineering the next-generation spintronic devices. Recently, studies on magnetic properties of 2D materials by optical methods have attracted considerable attention due to their novel magneto-optical phenomena, such as the magneto-optical Kerr effect and magneto-optical Raman effect.26–28 The construction of van der Waals heterostructure interfaces provides an exciting platform for studying exciton–magnon interaction effects.29,30 However, most magnetic materials are indirect bandgap semiconductors with very poor luminescence efficiency. Their investigations are mainly focused on magnetic and electronic properties. More research attention is required on the optical properties of 2D magnetic materials and their heterostructures. Studies of optical properties based on the heterostructures of WSe2 and antiferromagnetic ordering FePS3 have not been reported to date.
Here, we construct a new vdW heterostructure by stacking together monolayer WSe2 and different-layered FePS3, of which the varying optical properties with FePS3 thickness are systematically investigated. In such a WSe2/FePS3 heterostructure, the constituent WSe2 monolayer, as a direct bandgap semiconductor, is a good “sensor” to reveal the thickness-dependent characteristics of the interfaced FePS3. A strong photoluminescence (PL) quenching is revealed in the heterostructure as compared to the individual WSe2. Such a PL quenching effect becomes more obvious as the FePS3 thickness increases, indicating that a more efficient interlayer charge transfer process occurs in thicker FePS3. The charge carrier dynamics of the heterostructure is further demonstrated by transient absorption measurements. Using femtosecond pump–probe spectroscopy, we show that charge carriers of WSe2 transfer into FePS3 within 1 ps, resulting in the fluorescence quenching of WSe2 excitons. This charge transfer process is efficient in the form of a type II band alignment appearing in WSe2–FePS3 heterostructures, of which the rate is faster for a thicker FePS3 layer. The thickness-dependent charge transfer processes and corresponding excitonic properties are also revealed in the low-temperature PL spectra of WSe2–FePS3 heterostructures. We envision that more 2D magnetic materials can be used to tune the optical performance of conventional 2D semiconductors in vdWHs.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a schematically shows the cross-section of the heterostructure studied in this work. A monolayer WSe2 flake and an FePS3 flake with different thicknesses are vertically stacked together to form a 2D layer-stacked heterostructure by vdW interlayer coupling. It is important that all the regions are achieved on a single monolayer WSe2 flake, so that sample-to-sample variations can be largely eliminated. Fig. 1b and S1† show the optical microscope image and scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of WSe2/nL-FePS3 heterostructure samples by using the PPC-assisted dry-transfer method, respectively. To achieve a high-quality vdW interface, all the exfoliation and transfer processes are performed in a N2-filled glove box. The FePS3 layers are 8, 13, 16 and 20 nm thick, respectively, where the thicknesses are determined by atomic force microscope measurements (Fig. S2†).

The Raman spectra collected from monolayer WSe2, WSe2/FePS3 heterostructures, and few-layer FePS3 with 532 nm laser excitation are displayed in Fig. 1c and d, respectively. In Fig. 1d, the Raman spectra of FePS3 are consistent with previous reports,31 showing four distinctive Raman peaks in the range of 200 cm−1 to 500 cm−1. The peaks at 243 cm−1 and 377 cm−1 are assigned to the A1g modes, which originate from the out-of-plane vibration of P2S6 molecules. The peaks at 222 cm−1 and 276 cm−1 are assigned to the Eg modes, as attributed to the molecular-like vibrations from [P2S6]4− bipyramidal structures. Fig. 1c shows the Raman spectra of a WSe2 monolayer and WSe2/nL-FePS3 heterostructures. The two peaks ascribed to the WSe2 monolayer are observed: the peak located at 248 cm−1 is ascribed to the in-plane E12g vibration and the peak at 260 cm−1 is for the out-of-plane A1g vibration.32 For the heterostructures, the Raman signatures belonging to the phonon vibration modes of both WSe2 (E12g and A1g) and FePS3 (Eg and A1g) are identical to that of their individual counterparts with no additional new peaks.

Fig. 1e shows the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the isolated WSe2, isolated FePS3, and WSe2/FePS3 heterostructure under 532 nm laser excitation with a power density of ∼6.69 mJ cm−2. The PL yield and spectral shape of monolayer WSe2 are both consistent with previously reported results.33 Under the same PL measurement conditions, FePS3 shows no detectable signal and the heterostructure shows only one PL peak belonging to WSe2. It is noted that there does occur a PL quenching in the heterostructure in comparison with the isolated WSe2, and the quenching effect becomes more obvious as the FePS3 thickness increases. This PL quenching effect of the WSe2 is indicative of charge transfer between WSe2 and FePS3. The PL wavelength of the heterostructure shows a red shift relative to that of isolated WSe2, which becomes more obvious with thicker FePS3, as is explained later. We also noted that the PL of the heterostructure is slightly broader than that of the isolated WSe2, which could be due to additional scattering of excitons introduced by interface defects. The defects could lead to enhanced phonon scattering with increasing temperature and thus the broadening of PL peaks.34 However, further investigations are needed to fully understand this feature.

As characterized by the PL spectra in Fig. 2b and d, whether under or on top of the FePS3 layer, the PL of monolayer WSe2 is always strongly quenched and accompanied by a red-shift.

We employed DFT calculations to compute the band alignments and band structures of WSe2/2L-FePS3 and WSe2/10L-FePS3 heterostructures (Fig. 3a and Fig. S3†). The thickness of the WSe2/2L-FePS3 and WSe2/10L-FePS3 heterostructures is around 1.6 and 6.4 nm, respectively. DFT calculations show that both WSe2/2L-FePS3 and WSe2/10L-FePS3 heterostructures have a type-II band alignment with p-type WSe2 and n-type FePS3. The conduction band (valence band) offsets of WSe2/2L-FePS3 and WSe2/10L-FePS3 heterostructures are 0.52 and 0.57 eV (0.63 and 0.54 eV), respectively. Our calculations clearly show that the band alignment of the WSe2/FePS3 heterostructures remains unchanged with an increase of the FePS3 thickness. Due to such an alignment, electrons can efficiently transfer from WSe2 to FePS3, whereas holes will transfer from FePS3 to WSe2. The transferred electrons and holes are spatially separated in the two layers, resulting in poor radiative recombination efficiency and then the quenched PL of heterostructures. There are two different excitonic states in monolayer WSe2 with p-type characteristics: one is a neutral exciton (X) including one electron and one hole, and the other is a charged exciton (Xtrion) including two holes and one electron. The emission energy of Xtrion is lower than that of X because a partial energy release is required following an additional combination with a charged carrier. As previously reported, the charge transfer across the heterostructure interface can change the spectral weight of excitons (Xtrion) and neutral excitons (X) in transition metal dichalcogenides,35 in which the emission energy of Xtrion is lower than that of X. Therefore, the increased weight ratio of Xtrion/X results in a PL red shift. More holes transferring from FePS3 to WSe2 gives rise to a larger spectral weight of Xtrion in WSe2–FePS3 heterostructures than in that of the isolated WSe2, resulting in the dominant emission of a charged exciton (Xtrion) with a low-energy position (Fig. S4†). The charge transfer changes the ratio of Xtrion and X, therefore, the total quenching and red shift of the WSe2 emission peak in WSe2–FePS3 heterostructures are observed, and these become more obvious the thicker the FePS3 layer.

(b) Differential reflection signals of an isolated WSe2 monolayer, isolated few-layer FePS3 and WSe2/nL-FePS3 heterostructures as a function of the probe delay measured with a 400 nm pump and a 743 nm probe at a power density 63.6 μJ cm−2. (c) Peak differential reflection signal (left axis) and two time constants deduced from biexponential fits (right axis) of WSe2/nL-FePS3 heterostructures as a function of the FePS3 thickness. 
To further investigate the thickness-dependent charge transfer process in WSe2–FePS3 heterostructures, transient absorption microscopy (TAM) was performed. The pump wavelength was thus selected to be 400 nm for photocarrier generation, and the probe wavelength was selected to be 743 nm to study the carrier dynamics in WSe2. We first investigated the isolated WSe2 monolayer. Fig. S5a† shows the differential reflection signal of the isolated WSe2 as a function of probe delay under different excitation densities of 4.77 μJ cm−2, 15.9 μJ cm−2, 31.8 μJ cm−2, 47.7 μJ cm−2, 63.6 μJ cm−2 and 95.4 μJ cm−2, respectively. The differential reflection is defined as ΔR/R0 = (R − R0)/R0, where R and R0 are the reflectance of the sample at the probe wavelength with and without the presence of the pump, respectively. Fig. S5a† presents the pump-fluence dynamics dependence results of the isolated WSe2. As shown in Fig. S5b,† the maximum ΔR/R0 signals linearly increase with increasing excitation intensities, suggesting the high-order recombination processes (such as carrier–carrier annihilation and Auger recombination processes) can be neglected in this excitation range. Thus, the ΔR/R0 signals can reveal that the ratio is proportional to the density of the excitons. The decay of the signal can be fit by a bi-exponential function, that is, ΔR/R0 = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2) + B. The fitting results give a fast decay component, τfast, and a slow decay component, τslow (Fig. S5c†). According to previous studies,36 the fast decay component τfast can be attributed to the exciton formation process, while the slow decay component τslow reflects the recombination lifetime of the excitons. The value of τfast is about 0.4 ps at a power density 63.6 μJ cm−2 and increases slightly with an increase of pump fluence, which is attributed to the movement of carriers from the detection light window to the bandgap edge during thermal equilibria. The τslow value remains almost constant when varying pump fluence, further indicating that high-order recombination processes are not dominant in this excitation range.
Next, we performed transient absorption (TA) measurements with the same pump–probe configurations to study the WSe2–FePS3 heterostructure. A pump of 3.1 eV (400 nm) was used to excite the heterostructure sample (the blue arrow in Fig. 3a). Since its photon energy is above the optical bandgap of FePS3 (1.5 eV)37 and WSe2 (1.65 eV),38 it can excite the WSe2 layer and the FePS3 layer simultaneously. Here, both layers are excited, and electrons and holes are expected to transfer along opposite directions and separate across the two layers (according to the type-II band alignment in a WSe2/FePS3 heterostructure). A 743 nm probe pulse was used to detect the electron transfer process of the WSe2 layer, which is close to the optical band gap of the WSe2 monolayer (the orange-brown arrow in Fig. 3a). Fig. 3b displays the differential reflection signals of an isolated WSe2 monolayer, an isolated few-layer FePS3 and WSe2/nL-FePS3 heterostructures as a function of the probe delay. The isolated FePS3 shows a negligible signal because the wavelength of the probe photon energy is beyond the absorption edge of FePS3. For the heterostructure, all signals are weaker than that of the isolated WSe2 monolayer, because the electrons are excited in WSe2 and sequentially transferred to FePS3 in the heterostructure.
Finally, the dependence of differential reflection signals on the thickness of FePS3 in WSe2/nL-FePS3 heterostructures was also investigated. As shown from the left axis of Fig. 3c, the maximum values of differential reflection signals are inversely proportional to the thickness of FePS3. Meanwhile, the decay of a differential reflection signal can also be fit with the same bi-exponential function. As shown from the right axis of Fig. 3c, a fast decay component τfast and a slow decay component τslow can be extracted. With an increasing thickness of FePS3, τfast decreases, indicating that the decay rates of carriers become faster as the thickness of FePS3 increases.
In order to establish a correlation between PL spectral changes and the magnetic phase transition of FePS3 in WSe2/nL-FePS3 heterostructures, we performed temperature-dependent PL measurements. Fig. 4a shows the optical microscope image of another WSe2–FePS3 heterostructure with a large monolayer WSe2 flake stacked upon an FePS3 flake with different thicknesses. The monolayer WSe2 is outlined by red dashed lines, and the marked points 1, 2, and 3 represent the different regions of the heterostructure with different FePS3 thicknesses of 6 nm, 20 nm, and 40 nm, respectively. Fig. 4b–e show the normalized PL spectra of the isolated WSe2 monolayer, point 1, point 2, and point 3 in the temperature range from 290 K to 80 K with 532 nm laser excitation, respectively.

The WSe2 monolayer is outlined by red dashed lines. (b)–(e) Normalized photoluminescence (PL) spectra of an isolated WSe2 monolayer and at three points of the WSe2/nL-FePS3 heterostructure at the different temperatures indicated, respectively. (f)–(i) PL spectra of an isolated WSe2 monolayer and at three points of the WSe2/nL-FePS3 heterostructure at 80 K, respectively. Filled areas under the curve represent trion, neutral exciton and structural defects introduced by a trapped-state bound exciton fit by Lorentz functions. (j) The corresponding wavelengths of PL peaks and ratios of trions to neutral excitons for an isolated WSe2 monolayer and the WSe2/nL-FePS3 heterostructure at 80 K, respectively. 
We first checked the temperature-dependent PL of the isolated WSe2 on a SiO2/Si substrate. As shown in Fig. 4b, the PL spectrum of the monolayer WSe2 changes from one to two peaks as the temperature decreases. The reason for this is that the binding energy of Xtrion is much lower than that of the exciton in monolayer TMDCs, and Xtrion has a lower thermal stability and a higher thermal quenching than X.39,40 Both populations of bound states and Xtrion lifetimes decrease with increasing temperature, leading to a less intense and broader trion peak, which becomes suppressed at room temperature.39

Fig. 4b–e further compare the normalized PL spectra of isolated WSe2 and point 1, point 2 and point 3 in the WSe2/nL-FePS3 heterostructure at the representative temperatures. As shown in Fig. 4c–e, the PL spectra display some broad peaks. Fig. 4f–i demonstrate the fitted PL spectra of the isolated WSe2 monolayer and the WSe2/nL-FePS3 heterostructure at 80 K as extracted from Fig. 4b–e, respectively. Different from the two PL peaks of the isolated WSe2 monolayer, point 1, point 2 and point 3 in WSe2/nL-FePS3 heterostructures reveal three Lorentzian profiles of an Xtrion peak, an X peak and an Xd peak for structural defects introduced by a trapped-state bound exciton, respectively.41 The PL peaks of point 1, point 2 and point 3 in the WSe2/nL-FePS3 heterostructure show a general red-shift compared with those of the isolated WSe2 monolayer, which could be ascribed to an increasing ratio of Xtrion and X affected by the lower FePS3 layer (Fig. 4j).35 As is evident from the above thickness-dependent results of PL and TA, the hole transfer from FePS3 to WSe2 becomes more efficient as the thickness of FePS3 increases in these heterostructures.
Fig. S6† shows the PL peak intensity of neutral excitons as a function of temperature for the point 1, point 2 and point 3 in the WSe2/nL-FePS3 heterostructure, respectively. The results show that the peak intensity of the FePS3 flake shows a kink at around 120 K, which is close to the Néel transition temperature TN of FePS3 (∼118 K).42 Also, a similar kink occurring at around 120 K is shown in the temperature-dependent PL spectra for the point 1, point 2 and point 3 samples. This suggests the presence of a strong correlation between excitonic properties of WSe2/FePS3 heterostructures and the antiferromagnetic ordering of FePS3. When T < TN, the PL intensity of heterostructures increases with increasing temperature because the thermal fluctuations will disturb the antiferromagnetic ordering induced by spin–spin interactions in FePS3,43 which thus affects the charge transfer processes from FePS3 to WSe2 and then the PL of WSe2. When T > TN, FePS3 becomes paramagnetic and it can be approximated with being a non-magnetic semiconductor, in which the electron–phonon interactions play a key role in affecting the charge transfer processes. As a result, the PL intensity of the sole WSe2 and the heterostructures reduces with increasing temperature when T > TN. Our results suggest that the magnetic structure of FePS3 can influence the optical properties of WSe2/FePS3 heterostructures.
Conclusions
In summary, a new van der Waals heterostructure composed of a WSe2 monolayer and different layers of FePS3 is constructed. Such heterostructures demonstrate efficient interlayer charge transfer between WSe2 and FePS3, which can be further tuned by the thickness of FePS3, as is evident from a series of optical property characterization studies. The PL of WSe2 in the heterostructure is strongly quenched with the formation of a type-II band alignment, and the quenching effect becomes more obvious as the FePS3 thickness increases. The results of transient absorption measurements show that electrons excited in WSe2 can transfer to FePS3 on an ultrafast timescale of 1 ps. Meanwhile, holes excited in FePS3 can transfer to WSe2. The separation of electrons and holes in different layers prolongs their recombination lifetimes and lowers the recombination efficiency. The low-temperature PL spectra reveal that the PL intensity of WSe2–FePS3 heterostructures coincidently show an obvious change at 120 K, which is very close to the Néel temperature of FePS3. Our results show that the optical properties of magnetic semiconductors, particularly those for indirect bandgap ones, can be visualized by combining them with other 2D direct bandgap semiconductors in vdWHs. Also, the thickness and magnetism of 2D magnetic materials can work as an experimental tuning knob to change the optical performance of conventional 2D semiconductors, endowing van der Waals heterostructures with more unexpected and multifunctional properties.
Experimental
The preparation of FePS3 single crystals
High-quality single crystals of FePS3 were grown by a typical chemical vapor transport (CVT) method. Firstly, stoichiometric amounts of high-purity Fe powder (5.000 g, 99.99%, purchased from Alfa Aesar), P granules (99.999%, 0.846 g, purchased from Alfa Aesar), S granules (99.999%, 2.626 g, purchased from Alfa Aesar), and iodine granules as the transport agent were placed in a quartz ampoule and sealed under a vacuum. Then, the ampoule was further placed in a horizontal 2-zone furnace over a temperature gradient from 750–650 °C and kept at that condition for 21 days. Finally, the furnace was cooled down to room temperature and FePS3 single crystals were obtained for the subsequent preparation of nanoflakes.
The preparation of WSe2 single crystals
High-quality single crystals of WSe2 were obtained by a typical CVT method. Firstly, stoichiometric amounts of high-purity W powder (5.000 g, 99.999%, purchased from Alfa Aesar), Se granules (99.999%, 2.311 g, purchased from Alfa Aesar), and iodine granules as the transport agent were placed in a quartz ampoule and sealed under a vacuum. Then, the ampoule was further placed in a horizontal 2-zone furnace over a temperature gradient from 1000–920 °C and kept at that condition for 21 days. Finally, the furnace was cooled down to room temperature and WSe2 single crystals were obtained for the subsequent preparation of nanoflakes.
The preparation of WSe2/FePS3 heterostructures
The FePS3 and WSe2 flakes used in this study were fabricated by mechanical exfoliation (also known as “the Scotch tape method”) and a dry transfer technique. To avoid degradation, the exfoliation and transfer processes are carried out in a N2-filled glovebox (MIKROUNA-Universal Series) with O2 and H2O concentrations less than 0.01 ppm. First, a large number of flakes are cleaved from the fresh surface of as-grown FePS3 crystals using Scotch tape and then placed onto cleaned quartz substrates. Then, the monolayer WSe2 samples are also exfoliated from bulk counterparts and transferred onto FePS3 flakes with desired layer numbers to form 1L-WSe2/nL-FePS3 heterostructures. For FePS3/WSe2 heterostructures, a similar approach has been presented with the opposite stacking order. We intentionally left a portion of WSe2 flakes on the SiO2 substrate as a reference to observe the influence of FePS3. Finally, to improve the interlayer coupling between WSe2 and FePS3, all samples are annealed for 2 h at 350 °C under a 100 sccm Ar gas environment at a pressure of 2–3 Torr.
Characterization
The topography and height profile of FePS3 are measured by AFM (Cypher S) in noncontact mode. The optical photograph is taken with a Nikon DS-Ri2, with a mercury lamp as the excitation source (Nikon ECLIPSE Ci-S). The photoluminescence (PL) spectra are recorded under 532 nm laser excitation, with the laser beam focused to a spot size of ≈500 nm (Zolix Finder Smart FST2-MPL501-405C1). As for the Raman measurements, a 1500 g mm−1 grating is used. To carry out the temperature-dependent PL measurements, the samples are loaded in a liquid N2-flow closed-cycle cryostat under a high vacuum of ∼2 × 10−5 Torr. A 532 nm laser is used as the excitation source and focused on the sample by a 50× objective lens (NA = 0.5). The laser power (Sanwa) is kept at a low value of 0.4 mW to avoid laser-induced damage and any heating effects. The PL signals are dispersed by an Omni-λ-500i spectrometer with a 3-G150/B500 grating and detected using a CCD.
Transient absorption measurements
The ultrafast transient absorption properties are investigated by a home-made femtosecond pump–probe transient absorption setup. A high-power femtosecond laser (repetition rate of 400 kHz, 1030 nm central wavelength, and pulse duration of ≈120 fs, PHAROS, Light Conversion) is used to pump the optical parametric amplifier (ORPHEUS Twins, Light Conversion) and generate two pulses with a central wavelength tunable from 320 to 2700 nm. In our configuration, one of the two pulses is selected at 400 nm to pump the WSe2/FePS3 heterostructures, and the other at 743 nm goes through the delay stage (DDS600-E/M, Thorlabs) and acts as the probe light to monitor the exciton dynamics of the WSe2 component. The pump and probe pulses are focused on the sample by a 60× objective (0.95 NA, Nikon) with a spot size smaller than 1 μm. The reflected light is then directed into an avalanche photodiode (APD410A/M, Thorlabs) and measured by a lock-in amplifier that is synchronized with an acoustic optical modulator (AOM, Gooch Housego) that modulates the pump intensity at about 100 kHz.
DFT calculations
All ground state properties of the WSe2/2L-FePS3 and WSe2/10L-FePS3 heterostructures were computed using the Quantum ESPRESSO package44 based on density functional theory (DFT). Ultrasoft pseudopotentials45 with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional46 were employed to calculate the two heterostructures. The kinetic energy cutoffs of 25 and 200 Ry were used for the wave functions and augmented charge density, respectively. To capture the van der Waals interaction between these 2D-layered materials, Grimme's correction47 was applied in the calculations. Because the PBE functional was too weak to describe strongly correlated systems, we used DFT+U calculations48 for the 3d orbitals of the iron atoms (U = 3.3 eV). By using the DFT+U methods, the calculated bandgap of bulk FePS3 was 1.4 eV, which is consistent with that of previous experimental studies.37 The two heterostructures were constructed by layering WSe2 (√2 × 3√2 supercell) and FePS3 (1 × 1 unit cell). The lattice constants of the heterostructures are a = 5.76 Å and b = 9.97 Å (the lattice mismatch: ∼0.3%). To remove spurious interactions between periodically repeated model slabs, a vacuum spacing of >15 Å along the c-axis direction is used. All calculations for the heterostructures were computed using a 4 × 2 × 1 k-point mesh.
