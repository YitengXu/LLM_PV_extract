    , Accepted 8th May 2020First published on 14th May 2020AbstractA hot exciton model is a widely accepted mechanism for the generation of photocurrent in organic bulk-heterojunction solar cells, in which the charge is transferred from the high-energy Frenkel exciton state (FE state) of the donor to the low-energy charge transfer states (CT states) and then is further separated into free charges. However, the FE state energy of the acceptor (FEA state) is usually lower than the values of CT states, which could hinder the pathway of efficient charge transfer from the FEA state to CT states. In order to take full advantage of this pathway, in this study, acceptor molecule 1 which breaks the Kasha's rule was selected to constitute the donor/acceptor (D/A) interface with donor molecule PTB7-Th. The density functional theory (DFT) and the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations focusing on the charge transfer mechanism were carried out to verify our supposition. The results indeed show higher energy in the FEA state than the lowest CT states and enhanced charge transfer contribution (about 90%), which implies the realization of this additional pathway. Meanwhile, based on acceptor molecule 1, molecules 2–6 were designed by introducing different functional groups with the aim of enhancing the open circuit voltage (VOC) and photo-absorption ability while maintaining the advantage of the higher FE state energy, which demonstrates the improvement in hole and electron generation efficiency to some extent. Therefore, this study may provide a good strategy for designing new non-fullerene acceptors for organic solar cells (OSCs).
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) as a class of devices in which light energy is converted into electrical energy have attracted extensive attention due to their merits such as high flexibility, light-weight and low-cost.1–4 In the past few years, with the rapid development of non-fullerene acceptors, the efficiency of bulk-heterojunction OSCs has been significantly improved.5–9 Recently, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 16% has been achieved by bulk-heterojunction OSCs constructed using non-fullerene acceptors.10,11 Compared with fullerene acceptors, non-fullerene acceptors, which present the advantages of adjustable energy levels, effective photon absorption and easy synthesis, perform better in spectral complementarity with the donor and charge separation at the donor/acceptor (D/A) interface.12–17
As is well-known, the generation of photocurrent in OSCs usually involves the following processes: (i) optical absorption to form neutral Frenkel exciton (for fullerene-based OSCs, usually in the donors), (ii) electron transfer from the Frenkel exciton states (FE states) to the charge transfer states (CT states) at the D/A interface, and (iii) electron and hole escape of coulomb bound to generatefree charge.9,18–21 According to the widely accepted hot exciton model,22–25 charge is transferred from the higher-level FE states to the lower-level CT states and then is further separated. Therefore, forming more CT states in the second step will be beneficial to improve the charge separation efficiency at the interface. Generally, the FE states are mainly derived from the donors by virtue of their higher energies than the CT states;26,27 however, the FE state energy of most non-fullerene acceptors is relatively low, which is reflected from the relative red-shifted absorption spectra of most acceptors compared with those of donors. This will greatly limit the charge transfer from the Frenkel exciton state of the acceptor (FEA state) to CT states.28 So the question here is can we obtain non-fullerene acceptors with higher FE states? By increasing the energy of the FEA state, the pathway of charge transfer from the FEA state to the CT states can be achieved, and then more formation opportunities of CT states can be realized, thereby more free charges and holes will be generated at the interface.29,30
A series of 6,6′-diaryl-substituted biazulene diimides reported by Xike Gao and coworkers attracted our attention,31,32 as these molecules break the Kasha's rule and stronger photo-absorption occurs at higher excited states which may have the potential to achieve the expected mechanism that the FEA state needs to be at higher level than the lowest CT states. Therefore, the 6,6′-diaryl-substituted biazulene diimides molecule was selected as acceptor molecule 1 to construct the D/A interface with donor molecule PTB7-Th (seen in Scheme 1). The density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) methods were employed to explore the charge transfer mechanism at the interface.33,34 It was found that the selected acceptor proved our thoughts that it can generate an additional charge transfer pathway by the FEA state and thus achieves higher charge transfer probability. In addition, while maintaining the advantage of the higher FEA state than the lowest CT state, molecules 2–6 were designed by introducing five different functional groups to fine-tune the energy levels to increase the open circuit voltage (VOC) and enhance the photo-absorption ability, and thus improve the PCE of this series of molecules finally. We hope that this study can provide a useful strategy for designing non-fullerene acceptors with the charge transfer mechanism.

Computational methods
The ground state structure of acceptor 1 was optimized through B3LYP, PBE0, M06-2X, M06, ωB97XD and BHandHLYP functionals at the 6-31G(d,p) basis level, respectively. The results show that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level calculated by B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) is in good agreement with experimental data shown in Table 1 and Table S1 (ESI†).31 To investigate the optical properties, the TD-DFT method with B3LYP, PBE0, CAM-B3LYP, M06-2X, M06, TPSSH and BHandHLYP functionals was employed to simulate the absorption spectrum of acceptor 1 in dichloromethane solution. From Fig. S1 (ESI†) which was plotted using the Multiwfn 3.6 package,35 it is easy to find that the maximum absorption wavelength obtained at the TD-PCM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level is closer to the experimental one.

To simulate the D/A interface models, the individual donor and acceptor were stacked with an initial distance of 3.5 Å firstly,36,37 and then the ground state of the interface model was optimized at the B3LYP-D2/6-31G(d) level, in which the D2 version of Grimme dispersion was used to consider the weak interactions between the donor and acceptor.38 All parameters related to the excited state of the interface models were calculated at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d) level considering the charge transfer between the donor and acceptor. In addition, the charge density difference (CDD) maps were plotted using the Multiwfn 3.6 package, and the electronic coupling values were calculated by using the Q-Chem program.39 All of the above calculations involving DFT and TD-DFT were carried out using the Gaussian 09 package.40 Meanwhile, the rate of charge transfer (kCS) was calculated by the semi-empirical Marcus formula,41 which is detailed in the ESI.†
Results and discussion
Open circuit voltage and energy driving force
In OSCs, the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy levels affect the VOC, charge separation capability and photon absorption ability.42 In this study, the HOMO energy level of molecule 1 was calculated using the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) method, and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level value was obtained by adding the band gap to the HOMO energy level value.43,44 The corresponding values are shown in Table 1.
According to the PCE formula, there is no doubt that VOC is one of the important factors determining the PCE. Although VOC is affected by many factors, such as the semiconductor level, light intensity, charge carrier recombination and so on, we usually use the simple formula  to estimate VOC,36,45–47 since it generally provides values closer to the experimental results. Here, 0.5 V is the empirical value of effective charge separation for the OSCs constructed by non-fullerene acceptors,48,49 and e is the elementary charge. EIP(D) and EEA(A) can be approximated by the HOMO energy level of the donor and the LUMO energy level of the acceptor, respectively. The VOC value of 1 obtained based on this method is listed in Table 1, which is in good accordance with the experimental value,31 indicating the reliability of our method. In addition, in order to effectively separate excitons into free carriers during the process of interfacial charge transfer, enough energy driving force ΔE is needed. ΔE can be calculated from the LUMO energy level difference between the donor and acceptor. The calculated ΔE value of 1 is 0.73 eV, which could ensure effective exciton splitting.50,51
Parameters related to short-circuit current
It is widely known that short-circuit current density (JSC) is one of the most important parameters influencing the PCE, and JSC is affected by many physical parameters, such as, light absorption capacity of the donor and acceptor, charge transfer and recombination at the D/A interface and charge transport properties of donor and acceptor materials.52,53

Optical properties. 
OSCs need to capture as much sunlight as possible to convert light energy into electrical energy. Therefore, it is better to have a suitable match with the solar spectrum for the donor and acceptor for the sake of increasing JSC and further enhancing the PCE.46 The absorption spectra of the donor PTB7-Th and acceptor 1 were simulated at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level in the dichloromethane solvent as shown in Fig. 1. At the same time, the calculated excitation energies E, corresponding oscillator strengths f and major configurations of the acceptor 1 are listed in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 1, the donor has good light absorption capacity in the range of 300–800 nm, which demonstrates the excellent absorption of the donor in enhancing JSC, while acceptor 1 has good absorption in the range of 300–600 nm and two peaks at around 350 nm and 450 nm, respectively. It is interesting that the low energy peak just compensates for the weak absorption of the donor at around 450 nm, which favors the better absorption in the whole visible range of OSC devices. In addition, it can be found from Table 2 that the main absorption of acceptor 1 (f is bigger than 1.0) is at 455 nm, 369 nm, and 335 nm, which are derived from the electron transitions of S0 → S3, S0 → S8 and S0 → S15, respectively. This is different from the common π-conjugated molecules in terms of absorption properties, i.e., acceptor 1 has particularly weak absorption at S1 and S2 but has stronger absorption at the S3 state. At the same time, the big energy gap between S3 and S2 suggests weak internal conversion from S3 to S1, which indicates that fluorescence emission may happen from S3 rather than S1 to S0 for 1. In order to verify this point, we also calculated the emission properties of 1 based on both the optimized structures at S1 and S3 states. The results shown in Tables S2 and S3 (ESI†) suggest that the oscillator strength of the S3 state is much larger than those of S1 and S2 states for both cases. Therefore, the emission of 1 was conjectured to break the Kasha's rule.

The discussion on the FE and CT states. 
The charge transfer and recombination processes generally represent the charge transfer from the neutral FE states to CT states and from CT states to the ground state, respectively.54 In general, the donor is responsible for the main light absorption and electron donation contribution in OSCs, while for the acceptor, the absorption is weak and the FE state is usually located below the CT states as shown by a blue line in Fig. 2, and thus the charge transfer from FEA to CT states is seldom devoted to the charge separation at the donor/acceptor interface. If stronger absorption of the acceptor can be achieved and the FEA state is higher than the lowest CT state as shown by a red line in Fig. 2, the acceptor would provide the pathway of charge transfer from FEA to CT states, thereby there would be more opportunities for excited electrons to reach CT states. Accordingly, the charge separation efficiency at the D/A interface and thus the PCE of OSCs are expected to improve.
 Fig. 2  The relative energy levels of FE and CT states (for interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article). 
In order to analyze the FE and CT states at the interface in detail, 20 excited states were calculated based on the optimized interface structure as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). According to the characteristics of CT states (obvious loss of electrons for the donor and gain of electrons for the acceptor) and CDD maps which can be seen in Fig. S3 (ESI†), we considered S1, S5, S8, S9, S10, S13, and S14 to be the CT states, and S3 and S6 to be FED and FEA states, respectively. For the FE states and the neighboring CT states, the excitation energy alignments, the corresponding oscillator strengths f and CDD maps are shown in Fig. 3. It manifests that both FED and FEA states not only are higher than the CT1 state but also have a larger f. Consequently, acceptor 1 satisfies the expected mechanism i.e., the strong absorption state FEA could provide additional opportunities for charge separation in terms of its higher energy than the CT1 and CT2 states. In addition, considerable f values at CT2 and CT3 states (0.13 and 0.25, respectively) may lead to the direct excitation of CT states in this system, which is assigned to the direct mechanism.

Charge transfer rate. 
In general, in order to have high a PCE for OSCs, a large charge transfer rate (kCS) is required. Here both the kCS from FED and FEA states were evaluated according to the Marcus formula, wherein the values of the electronic coupling (VCS), reorganization energy (λCS) and Gibbs free energy (ΔGCS) need to be calculated.
As mentioned in the computational methods section, the VCS values between both FED and FEA states and all CT states were estimated by the generalized Mulliken-Hush (GMH) formalism and are shown in Table S4 (ESI†), which shows that FEA possesses larger VCS with CT1 and CT2 states than FED. In addition, as an exponential parameter, λCS which consists of inner reorganization energy (λint) and external reorganization energy (λext) influences the charge transfer rate much. The calculated λCS together with another important parameter ΔGCS is listed in Table 3. Because the charge transfer is a thermodynamically favorable process, the value of ΔGCS is negative. Thus the corresponding rate constant is inversely proportional to the absolute value of ΔGCS. Based on the above-mentioned parameters, kCS was obtained as shown in Table 3. It can be found that the pathway of charge transfer from FEA to CT states provides a considerable contribution, about 90% of the overall charge transfer rate, so the pathway is very important to increase the charge separation and to enhance the PCE.

Designed molecules based on molecule 1
According to the above analysis, molecule 1 provides the pathway of charge transfer from FEA to CT states, which is beneficial for efficient charge separation. However, the experimental result on the OSC constituted of donor PTB7-Th and acceptor 1 showed the lower PCE.31 Therefore, we hope that due to the advantage of the higher FEA state than CT states, the VOC and some other parameters related to the PCE can be further increased by designing new acceptor molecules, such as molecules 2–6 shown in Fig. 4 based on acceptor 1. All theoretical calculations were performed using the same methods as the PTB7-Th/1 system.
 Fig. 4  Molecular structures of designed molecules 2–6. 
The calculated FMO energy levels, energy driving force ΔE and the corresponding VOC for molecules 2–6 with the same donor PTB7-Th are shown in Table 4. We can find that the VOC values of the designed five molecules are higher than that of the previous acceptor molecule 1, this is because the introduction of functional groups increases the LUMO energy levels. Although the ΔEs of designed molecules are reduced, they still can ensure effective exciton separation at the D/A interface and complete the charge-separation process according to the referred value 0.5 eV.46,47,55

With regard to their photo-absorption properties, Fig. 5 illustrates that due to the introduction of functional groups, the absorption peaks of the designed molecules are red-shifted to a certain extent compared with those of acceptor 1. Although the peak at 450 nm which just makes up the weak absorption of donor in this range disappears, the absorption ranges in the visible range of molecules 2–6 become wider and stronger. This is beneficial for the improvement of their photo-absorption abilities. At the same time, a high-energy peak still exists for each designed molecule although there is red-shift, indicating that they may retain the higher FEA states.

The CDD maps of 20 excited states for each interface constructed with designed molecules and PTB7-Th are also plotted in Fig. S4–S8 (ESI†), which are used to identify the FE states and CT states for them. The relative excited-state energy level distributions along with CDD maps similar to that in Fig. 3 are shown in Fig. S9–S13 (ESI†), which manifest the higher FEA states maintained for these designed acceptors. In addition, the kCS values of designed molecules were also calculated by using the Marcus formula. According to the related parameters which are listed in Tables S5 and S6 (ESI†), the final kCS values are evaluated and are shown in Table 5. It shows that the kCS values of the designed molecule 2–6 are larger than that of the previous acceptor 1. Therefore, the designed molecules on the basis of acceptor 1 have higher VOCs, wider absorption spectra and larger kCS values, thus they are likely to become potential acceptor molecules. It is worth mentioning that all the designed acceptors unfold the contributions of the charge transfer rates from the FEA state referred to in Table S4 (ESI†), which is in accordance with our expectations.

Furthermore, in order to further verify our conclusion, we also calculated the electronic couplings and rates for the charge recombination process of all systems using the Marcus formula and are shown in Tables S7 and S8 (ESI†). It can be seen that the recombination rates for designed molecules 2–5 are much lower than that of molecule 1, which further confirms the higher efficiency of designed molecules. However, it should be noted that the values of electron recombination rates may be irrational. As we know it, Marcus theory has its precondition, i.e., the charge transfer process with light absorption can be simulated by quantum mechanical perturbation theory when the electronic coupling is weak, while it is clear from Table S7 (ESI†) that almost all the calculated electronic couplings are larger than the reorganization energy, which shows that the Marcus theory is not suitable to describe the charge recombination rate.
Conclusions
In this study, we selected the reported molecule 1 which breaks the Kasha's rule as the acceptor to construct the D/A interface with donor molecule PTB7-Th, aiming to investigate their OSC performance, especially for the charge transfer mechanism at the D/A interface by means of DFT and TD-DFT methods. In addition to the charge transfer from the high-energy FED state to the CT states, the pathway from the FE state of the acceptor to the CT states was also considered due to the higher FEA state than the CT states. The charge transfer rates produced by these two pathways were calculated, which indicates that the pathway of charge separation from FEA to CT states provides a large transfer rate, accounting for about 90% of the overall transfer rate, further confirming the important contribution of this pathway to the overall transfer rate. Moreover, molecules 2–6 were designed based on acceptor molecule 1 by introducing five different functional groups to maintain the pathway of charge transfer from FEA to CT states and improve the properties of VOC and JSC. It can be seen from the results that the designed molecules 2–6 may have a higher PCE than acceptor 1. This theoretical work reveals the importance of the pathway of charge transfer from the FE state of the acceptor to CT states, and we hope that it can provide guidelines for designing non-fullerene acceptors using the charge transfer mechanism.
