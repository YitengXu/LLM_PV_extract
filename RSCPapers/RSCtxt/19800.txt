The morphology of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) films significantly affects all individual steps of exciton generation and charge separation and transport. Although many solution processing techniques developed from fullerene-based systems have been effectively utilized for morphology control of NFA-based BHJs, the optimization process is still complicated due to diverse chemical structures of donor and NFA materials.

1. Introduction
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) that incorporate bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) blends as photoactive films are considered a promising renewable energy technology because of their advantages of being lightweight, mechanically flexible, colored, and solution-processable into large-area devices.1–3 After the first report of BHJ OPVs based on a conjugated polymer donor and the fullerene derivative phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM), polymer:fullerene derivative blend films emerged as an important research topic for achieving high OPV efficiency and were widely investigated for 20 years.4 In 2015, nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) were developed as replacements for the fullerene derivatives.5 The resultant donor:NFA BHJ films have been intensively studied because of the numerous advantages of NFAs, which include preparation methods amenable to tailored syntheses,6–9 tunable bandgaps that enable broader absorption in the near-infrared region,10–14 tunable energy levels that enable a high open-circuit voltage (VOC) and low energy loss,15–19 and structural flexibility that enables favorable matching of the frontier energy levels of donors.20,21 Extensive research related to the development of NFAs and optimization of their BHJ film morphology has been reported.6,22–30 Therefore, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction OPVs has rapidly improved from ∼10% for fullerene-based OPVs to 18% for NFA-based OPVs, as shown in Fig. 1a. The detailed OPV performance shown in Fig. 1 are summarized in Table S1 in the ESI.†

Numerous factors, including material structures, processing conditions, and the device configuration, influence the key parameters of OPVs (i.e., their VOC, short-circuit current density (JSC), and fill factor (FF)). In particular, the morphology of BHJ blends strongly affects each step of the photovoltaic mechanism of the devices, which includes exciton generation and dissociation, and charge transport and collection.31–33 Because the excitons are tightly bound by coulombic force, their lifetime is limited and their diffusion length is only ∼10 nm.31,34–36 Thus, the domain size should be confined to <20 nm to ensure that excitons reach the donor–acceptor interfacial zone and then efficiently dissociate into free charge carriers. However, high domain purity and a fine bicontinuous interpenetrating network nanostructure are also necessary to enable the rapid transfer of charge carriers to the electrodes and minimize bimolecular recombination.37–41
The morphology of a BHJ blend is affected by various factors, including the solubility, crystallinity, and miscibility of the organic material, the film processing method, and the surface property of the lower layers in the device structure. Therefore, to achieve an ideal morphology that enables high OPV performance, all of these factors should be considered together.30,32,42,43 In particular, whereas fullerene acceptors (FAs) such as PC61BM and phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) tend to share a relatively simple spherical conformation and exhibit small shifts in their physical properties irrespective of their chemical structures,43–45 NFAs exhibit various molecular stacking and aggregation behaviors during solution casting of a BHJ film, depending on the chemical structure of the NFA and the processing method.32,46,47 Among the continuously increasing number of developed NFAs, each can be paired with various donors.6,20,47–49 Accordingly, the NFAs and donors usually show more complicated behaviors during BHJ formation; NFA-based BHJs therefore require intensive empirical exploration and optimization by trial-and-error.6,47,48,50 In addition, to realize high-efficiency large-area OPV modules, it is required to successfully transfer the ideal morphology realized in small-area BHJ films to large-area BHJ films.3,51,52Fig. 1b shows the progress in increasing the efficiencies of fullerene- and NFA-based OPVs in large-area cells (>1 cm2) or modules. A remarkable increase in efficiency has been realized in large-area OPV devices as a result of the development of high-performance NFAs; however, the overall PCEs of the corresponding large-area devices remain much lower than those of small cells (refer the evolution of OPV efficiencies of small cells over time in Fig. 1a).9,53–55 An important reason for this difference in efficiency is that the BHJ film of OPVs undergoes morphological changes, and thus, exhibits a decrease in efficiency when the coating method is switched from lab-scale spin coating to an industrial-scale non-spin-coating method such as slot-die coating, blade coating, or spray coating.3,51,52,56–58 The effects of the organic materials and processing techniques on the BHJ morphology and device function need to be comprehensively understood.30,47,50,59 Such understanding will provide practical guidelines that enable the development of best-matched donor and acceptor materials and processing techniques for controlling the morphology of large-area BHJ films.
In the present report, we review recent progress in the development of organic materials and processing technologies for controlling the BHJ film morphology in OPV devices. First, we introduce the mechanism of BHJ formation and discuss the effects of organic active materials—in particular, fullerenes and NFAs—on the film morphology. We next discuss processing techniques, such as the use of ternary composition, solvent additives, and post treatment of the BHJ films, for improving the nanoscale morphology of BHJ films, along with corresponding research progress in NFA OPVs. Third, we survey coating techniques for forming BHJ films, such as non-spin-coating methods applicable to large-area OPVs. Fourth, we provide a summary and outlook for the future development of high-performance NFA OPVs for industrial-scale practical production.
2. Mechanistic understanding of BHJ formation
The nanoscale BHJ morphology of the active layer critically affects the photovoltaic properties of OPVs; therefore, attaining the optimal morphology for charge-carrier generation and transport is important for achieving high solar-cell performance.31,32,50,60 However, the formation of a BHJ with multiple components (i.e., a donor polymer, small molecular acceptor, and solvents) is too complex to simply address using a single mechanism.48,61–63 We need to explain the process of BHJ formation by considering both the thermodynamic and the kinetic aspects. The thermodynamic parameters of molecular interactions between a donor and acceptor, solubility parameters, and the crystallization (or/and aggregation) properties of donor polymers and NFAs strongly influence the phase separation behavior and the nanoscale packing structures.30,32,47,64,65 Also, different diffusivities of the polymer chains depending on their molecular weight and viscosity in a solution affect the mass transport of the materials during BHJ formation.47,66 Because of solvent evaporation during the BHJ formation process, we need to consider both the coating conditions and the kinetic terms correlated with the vapor pressure of the processing solvents.42,67
In the next section, we discuss the current understanding of the mechanisms of BHJ formation from the perspectives of thermodynamics and kinetics, and review recent research progress regarding the effect of organic active materials—especially diverse chemical structures of NFAs in comparison with FAs—on the morphological evolution of BHJ films.
2.1 Flory–Huggins theory
The miscibility between donor and acceptor materials is important because it determines the degree of phase separation of the resultant BHJ films. Materials with poor miscibility can result in large-scale phase separation, which causes inefficient exciton dissociation and charge generation.42,60,61,65,68 By contrast, BHJ films with well-intermixed fine structures exhibit poor charge transport properties and frequent charge recombination.59,69–71 Therefore, to optimize the BHJ morphology to attain the highest PCE, the selection of a donor and acceptor with appropriate miscibility is important.42,59,61
The Gibbs free energy change (ΔGmix) associated with mixing materials 1 and 2 with a certain composition is estimated using the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (χ):ΔGmix = RT[n1lnΦ1 + n2lnΦ2 + n1n2χ12]where R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, n1 and n2 are the number of moles of materials 1 and 2, respectively, and Φ1 and Φ2 are their respective volume fractions. The miscibility represented by χ is typically affected by the chemical structures of the donor and acceptor and by their molecular weights.59,72
In early studies of BHJ films, their miscibility was mostly investigated using a polymer donor and FA. Gomez and coworkers studied the morphology evolution of the poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT)/PC61BM system by monitoring PC61BM-rich regions using grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) and field-emission transmission electron microscopy, and estimated the miscibility of amorphous P3HT and PC61BM by quantifying their chemical interactions. They determined the P3HT–PC61BM χ parameter and the Flory–Huggins phase diagram, which predicted miscibility for P3HT volume fractions greater than 0.42. They also found that polymer crystallization induced by a thermal annealing (TA) process can lead to macroscopic phase separation by enriching the amorphous polymer phase with fullerenes beyond the miscibility limit.73 Later, Ade and coworkers first developed a method to determine χ(T) at a certain operating or processing temperature, where the value of χ(T) is determined by mapping the phase diagram of model amorphous polymer:fullerene blend systems. They obtained a quantitative “constant-kink-saturation” relationship between χ(T) and FF values for numerous OPV devices and delineated them across various high- and low-performing blend systems that include FAs and NFAs. Their results reveal that a higher FF (and, thus, a higher device efficiency) can be obtained when χ(T) is sufficiently large to induce substantial phase separation with high purity of the mixed domains.74
With the development of new NFAs, the mixing thermodynamics relating to morphology and device performance has received increasing attention in recent years.32,50,75,76 Several representative studies have described how χ can affect the morphology of NFA-based OPVs and, thus, their photovoltaic performance.7,30,32,50,65 For example, Ade and coworkers reported that IT-M shows lower miscibility with PBDB-T in a blend film when compared with IT-DM, which they found was correlated with IT-M exhibiting a higher χ parameter than IT-DM. Consequently, the PBDB-T:IT-M blend film achieved enhanced average domain purity compared with the PBDB-T:IT-DM film, as demonstrated by resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) experiments on the blend films; this greater average domain purity resulted in decreased bimolecular recombination and, thus, improvements in the JSC and FF of the OPV device based on PBDB-T:IT-M.77 Recently, Hou and coworkers developed a new acceptor named ZY-4Cl; a P3HT:ZY-4Cl blend film exhibited a greater χ parameter compared with the corresponding P3HT:BTP-4Cl blend film. The P3HT:ZY-4Cl BHJ film showed appropriate phase separation because excessive miscibility between the donor and acceptor was effectively suppressed; the corresponding solar-cell devices consequently achieved much higher efficiency than other reported P3HT-based OPVs.78 The effect of donor–acceptor miscibility on the BHJ morphology and device performance was studied using a polythiophene (PT) derivative (PDCBT-Cl) as the donor and various NFAs. Notably, a mixture of Y6 and PDCBT-Cl remained in a single-phase state because of the high miscibility (χ = 0.19) of the two components, which resulted in impure domains and poor molecular packing in the blend film. Consequently, the PDCBT-Cl:Y6 OPV device demonstrated a low JSC and low FF. By contrast, the acceptor ITIC-Th1, which has monofluorinated end groups, exhibited appropriate miscibility and phase separation with PDCBT-Cl. Therefore, the PDCBT-Cl:ITIC-Th1 BHJ exhibited suitable domain purity after post-treatment, which led to a PCE greater than 12%.22
2.2 Mechanism of phase separation
During solvent evaporation, two main processes govern the phase separation from the initial homogeneous solution phase coated onto the substrate: (i) liquid–liquid (L–L) phase separation by spinodal decomposition and (ii) solid–liquid (S–L) phase separation by solidification because the donor or acceptor component reaches its solubility limit (Fig. 2).50,67,72,79 The latter mechanism is usually accompanied by nucleation and crystal growth. Depending on the materials and processing conditions, one of the two mechanisms competitively precedes the other or both demixing mechanisms occur simultaneously. In cases where either of the phase separation mechanisms does not occur dominantly, the BHJ film may exhibit an intimately intermixed morphology.67,80
 Fig. 2  A scheme describing the phase separation evolution from liquid solutions of donors and acceptors. 

2.2.1 Mechanism of liquid–liquid phase separation. 
L–L demixing usually starts from an initially homogeneous single phase that subsequently separates into two phases. This phase separation process is strongly influenced by the interaction parameter between the donor and the acceptor; thus, a donor and acceptor with low mutual compatibility exhibit large-scale phase separation.50,61 By contrast, a donor–acceptor pair with high compatibility exists in an intermixed state during solvent evaporation; thus, when the solvent content is low, the morphological evolution stops before the phase separation fully develops because intermolecular interaction between the donor and acceptor becomes stronger and the molecules exhibit low mobility within the film.32,61 Moreover, the donor and/or acceptor molecules can become supersaturated and ready for solidification, which facilitates S–L phase separation rather than spinodal decomposition.
The oversized fullerene domains often observed in polymer:fullerene BHJ films are attributed to L–L phase separation.79–81 Fullerene-based acceptors such as PC61BM and PC71BM usually exhibit greater surface energy compared with conjugated polymer donors.82 Most polymer donors include alkyl chains that sufficiently increase their polymer solubility to enable solution processing;83 however, these solubilizing groups sometimes result in a decrease of the polymer surface energy.82 Functional groups, which are introduced into the polymer backbone to decrease the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of the polymer donor, and thus, increase the VOC, sometimes change the donor's surface energy.84 For example, fluorine substitution of a polymer donor can effectively control the molecular energy levels but simultaneously lowers the surface energy, which results in poor miscibility of the polymer with fullerene derivatives.82,85 Yu and coworkers synthesized copolymers of thienothiophene and benzodithiophene and substituted fluorine atoms at various positions in the polymer backbone.86 Monofluorination of the thienothiophene unit decreased the HOMO energy level and induced a strong dipole moment transition during excitation, which resulted in an increase of the VOC and the photocurrent of the corresponding OPV device. Consequently, the PCE of the device was improved from 5.1% for the PTBF0 donor to 6.2% of the PTBF1 donor. However, when more fluorine atoms were substituted, the polymer showed dramatically reduced miscibility with fluorophobic PC71BM, which led to large-scale phase separation of 50–200 nm and a decrease of the PCE of the OPV device to 2.7%. Song and coworkers also observed a reduced polymer surface energy when they introduced more fluorine atoms at the termini of the alkyl chains, which led to increased phase separation of the corresponding polymer:PC71BM BHJ films.82 As a result, the PCE of the OPV device based on the polymer of C6F13-included long perfluoroalkyl chains decreased to 1.98%.
The side chains play an important role because they provide sufficient polymer solubility for the synthesis of high-molecular-weight polymers and the solution preparation of OPV devices. However, donor polymers that incorporate bulky side chains have been reported to result in a BHJ morphology with large-scale phase separation.87,88 During the formation of a BHJ film, acceptors can efficiently move through flexible bulky aliphatic chains with large three-dimensional dynamic volumes rather than the polymer's rigid conjugated backbones, which enables the acceptor molecules to more easily aggregate and form large domains in the film. To simultaneously enhance both the miscibility and solubility, Son and coworkers developed donor polymers that include a dichlorobenzene moiety at the terminus of the side chain; this functional group can well interact with FAs and effectively improve the compatibility between the donor and acceptor.89,90 As a result, their OPV device processed using a non-halogenated solvent exhibited an improvement in efficiency to 6.07%, compared with 4.11% for the device with a control donor polymer. In other experiments, the miscibility of a donor and acceptor was increased through the synthesis of the fullerene derivative PyF5 with a pyrrolidine functional group, which showed diminished solubility parameters compared with PC61BM, and thus, enhanced compatibility with the donor polymer PTB7-Th.91,92 Therefore, the OPV device based on PyF5 exhibited better morphological stability under TA at 140 °C compared with a PC61BM-based device.
The compatibility of NFAs with polymer donors differs dramatically depending on the chemical structures of the NFAs, whereas the solubility parameters of fullerene-based materials tend to fall within a similar value range.32,65,93 Therefore, understanding the phase-separation phenomena of a polymer donor and NFAs and the mechanism of BHJ film generation is difficult. We need to carefully study the morphological evolution of NFA-based BHJ films by considering the effects of each functional group of the NFAs on their miscibility using both empirical case studies and theoretical approaches.
As addressed in the previous paragraph, longer alkyl side chains as a solubilizing group of donor polymers usually decrease the surface energy of the polymer; however, if the ratio of fluorine in the polymer backbone is increased by the introduction of shorter alkyl side chains, its surface energy can be oppositely decreased.94 PTAZ-TPD10 polymers have a relatively higher surface energy than PC71BM, and their surface energy decreases with decreasing alkyl side-chain length because of the greater ratio of backbone fluorine; thus, when the alkyl chain length is increased, miscibility with PC71BMs is effectively reduced. However, some NFAs such as N2200 and ITIC show different behaviors, compared with PC71BM, because their surface energy is greater than that of PC71BMs; thus, the polymers with longer alkyl chains exhibited improved miscibility with NFAs because of their relatively high surface energy. The PCEs of the PC71BM-based OPV devices consequently decreased from 6.3% to 2.9% as the alkyl side-chain length was increased from C6 to C10, whereas ITIC-based devices exhibited an increase in PCE from 5.5% to 8.8% with increasing side-chain length from C6 to C10.
The functional groups of polymer donors strongly affect intermolecular interactions of the donor and the NFAs. Hou and coworkers prepared four different NFAs via fluorine substitution (Fig. 3) and compared their interaction parameters.23 They found that the χ values decreased with the introduction of more fluorine atoms at the terminus of the 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile unit in the acceptor. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies showed that greater fluorine substitution of the acceptor led to a more intermixed BHJ morphology with the fluorinated PBDB-TF polymer. Such enhanced intermolecular interactions resulted in an increase in the charge-transfer (CT) states in the active film, which induced more efficient charge separation; consequently, the PCE of the OPV based on BTP-4F increased to 16.7%, compared with 8.2% for the device with the nonfluorinated acceptor.
 Fig. 3  The chemical structures of various acceptor materials. 
Along with their terminal group, the core structure of NFAs also strongly influences their surface energy. For example, Tang and coworkers reported that substitution of a methyl or methoxy group into the aromatic core in IT-4F (Fig. 3) led to NFAs with reduced surface energy, which resulted in improved miscibility between the NFA and the donor PM6.95 Consequently, a device with methyl-substituted NFA, IM-4F, achieved a higher PCE of 14.17% compared with 12.80% for a device with IT-4F because of its smaller VOC loss. Chen and coworkers have reported that the chemical structure of the alkoxy group incorporated into the core structure of NFA is important for controlling miscibility between the donor J52 and acceptor.96 The interaction parameter of UF-EH-2F, which is based on a 2-ethylhexyl group, was much greater than that of its counterparts based on a linear octyl or 1-ethylhexyl group. This greater interaction parameter resulted in suppressed miscibility and correspondingly greater domain purity; the OPV device fabricated using the 2-ethylhexyl-based UF-EH-2F showed a higher PCE (13.56%) than the device fabricated using 1-ethylhexyl-based UF-C2C5-2F (10.05%) because of its higher FF. In addition, the BHJ film with the 2-ethylhexyl-based UF-EH-2F exhibited greater thermal stability than the films with a linear octyl or 1-ethylhexyl group because the 2-ethylhexyl-based UF-EH-2F could form a thermodynamically stable film morphology, whereas the other alkyl groups resulted in BHJ films that were kinetically labile. Meanwhile, Huang and coworkers developed ITIC-OE by introducing an oligoethylene oxide side chain into the core of the acceptor ITIC.97 Intermolecular aggregation of ITIC during blending with PBDB-T was greatly reduced after incorporation of the oligoethylene oxide chain.


2.2.2 Mechanism of solid–liquid phase separation. 
S–L phase separation usually occurs when a donor or acceptor begins to aggregate after reaching its solubility limit or supersaturation in the deposition solvent. This S–L phase separation is dominantly affected by the thermodynamics and kinetics of the nucleation and growth processes of the aggregated solid phase. In donor or acceptor materials, nucleation, which is relatively favorable because of the materials' strong tendency to crystallize, can easily induce S–L demixing as a result of aggregation in solution.47,98,99 By contrast, materials with a low tendency toward crystallization because of a high activation energy barrier typically show poor S–L phase separation.100 Solvent drying dynamics and both the nucleation and growth processes of crystallites play important roles in determining the degree of S–L demixing. Fast solvent evaporation usually occurs when low-boiling-point solvents, a high spin-coating speed, and/or a high processing temperature is used, and the rapid evaporation disrupts effective aggregation or crystallization, resulting in a decrease in the degree of S–L demixing.67 S–L and L–L phase separations of the BHJ solution coated onto substrates mostly occur simultaneously but compete with each other.99 L–L phase separation is continuously affected by S–L phase separation occurring in the same BHJ solution because solidification changes the composition and concentration of either the donor and/or acceptor in the solution.
Yan and coworkers have developed a polymer named PffBT4T-2OD that exhibits different degrees of aggregation depending on the solution temperature.38 OPV devices based on the PffBT4T-2OD polymer blended with various fullerene derivatives achieved a high PCE (>10%) because of its high crystallinity and high charge mobility. The blend morphology was strongly affected by the solution temperature and the spinning rate; when the spinning rate was less than 700 rpm or the solution and the substrate temperature was relatively low, the crystallinity and size of the domains remarkably increased because the polymer had sufficient time to form packing structures before the solvent was completely dried. In contrast, kinetically quenched blend morphologies were observed when the spinning rate or processing temperature was high. Therefore, the BHJ morphology is affected by the aggregated structures of the polymer in the precursor solution and the film-forming thermodynamics governed by the processing temperature rather than by the surface energy of the materials. Meanwhile, Brabec and coworkers reported that the device photocurrent of an OPV based on a PffBT4T-2OD:PC61BM blend system showed an abnormally strong burn-in loss.101 The photocurrent densities of the OPV devices decreased 30–40% from their original values after 5 days of storage under dark and ambient conditions because the donor and acceptor, which exhibited low miscibility with each other, underwent phase separation during storage.
Cho and coworkers studied phase separation in the vertical direction of a PC61BM-based blend system by controlling the crystallinity and surface energy of the polymers.99 In a comparison of the interaction parameters of PC61BM-based blend systems, a regiorandom polymer named P3HT-RA showed a relatively low interaction parameter of 0.39, whereas the corresponding polymer with 91% regioregularity, named P3HT-RR91, exhibited a greater interaction parameter of 0.63 despite its identical chemical composition. The P3HT-RR91-based blend system with a large interaction parameter underwent phase separation in the vertical direction and the polymer which has lower surface energy places at the surface of the film through the L–L phase separation phenomenon. When the regioregularity of the polymer was further increased to 98% (P3HT-RR98), it showed an increase in crystallinity and a further increased interaction parameter of 0.66; however, the phase-separation phenomenon was greatly suppressed because, in cases where a polymer shows high crystallinity and low solubility, S–L phase separation is the dominant phase separation process, suppressing phase separation driven by interaction parameters.
Ade and coworkers have studied the phase separation of the PC71BM BHJ systems blended with PDPP3T polymers with various molecular weights.102 The surface energy of the polymers was found to increase with increasing polymer molecular weight; thus, the interaction parameter with PC71BM also increased with increasing molecular weight. Therefore, the PDPP3T polymer with a high molecular weight of 102 kDa underwent L–L phase separation when blended with PC71BM; however, when 3% of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was added to the blend solution, the blend film showed S–L phase separation behavior because of the limited solubility of the polymer, which resulted in reduced ordering of the polymer in the solid state with decreased domain purity.
Ye and coworkers studied the formation of blend morphologies with various NFAs and the polythiophene-based polymer PDCBT-Cl.22 Among the various NFAs, Y6 showed a single-phase blend morphology because of its low interaction parameter with the PDCBT-Cl donor and its low crystallinity, whereas highly crystalline NFAs ITIC-Th1 and IDIC, whose interaction parameters with the donor were larger, formed a morphology of percolating structures between two phases. After solvent vapor annealing (SVA) for 1 h, the highly crystalline ITIC-Th1 and IDIC showed an increase in domain size in the blend film, whereas the Y6-based BHJ film did not exhibit a substantial change. This difference is attributed to the highly crystalline ITIC-Th1 and IDIC forming a kinetically quenched blend morphology via S–L phase separation, which led to a change in morphology to the thermodynamically stable state after long-term SVA. Wei and coworkers studied BHJ films of a PTQ10 polymer blended with various NFAs, where the authors varied the chemical structures by introducing different core units.103 Poorly crystalline NFAs of IT-4Cl and m-ITIC-OR-4Cl showed a well-intermixed BHJ morphology, which is also attributable to their low interaction parameters with the donor polymer. In contrast, highly crystalline ID-4Cl and Y7 maintained their crystallinity relatively well in the blend films; Y7, in particular, formed a large crystalline disc 125 nm in diameter and 9 nm thick despite its interaction parameter being lower than that of the other investigated acceptors. The authors attributed this behavior to the morphology of the Y7-containing BHJ morphology evolving as a result of S–L phase separation driven by crystallization of the Y7.
Typically, highly crystalline donor polymers show high performance in OPV devices when the polymer blend films are prepared by a quenching process of S–L demixing and a high processing temperature is used because of the limited solubility of the polymers.72,104 Researchers have developed random polymerization methods to overcome this limitation because randomization of the polymer structure decreases the crystallinity of the polymer and improves its solubility, which results in a lower processing temperature.59,98,105 So and coworkers studied the blend morphology of O-IDTBR with random polymers based on 5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole, where quaterthiophene or terthiophene was introduced randomly.106 The interaction parameter between O-IDTBR and the random polymers increased as more 3 T repeating units were added into the polymer backbone; thus, PffBT4T-OD and PffBT4T90-co-3T10 (Fig. 4) showed relatively high miscibility with O-IDTBR. However, PffBT4T-OD and PffBT4T90-co-3T10 formed large domains in the BHJ film via S–L phase separation because of their high crystallinity and tendency to aggregate.

In contrast, PffBT4T50-co-3T50 and PffBT3T-2OD mostly showed L–L phase separation rather than S–L phase separation, resulting in high domain purity. As a result, the OPV device with PffBT3T-2OD showed a low PCE of 1.8% with excessive phase separation, whereas the device with PffBT4T90-co-3T10 exhibited a much higher PCE of 8.7%. Later, Son and coworkers also developed random terpolymers, which they prepared by incorporating a portion of BDT-Th units into a PffBT4T-2OD-based copolymer.107 When the ratio of the BDT-Th unit in the random polymer was increased, the interaction parameter of the polymer with PC71BM increased; thus, BDT-Th30, which contained 30% BDT-Th units, showed a large L–L phase separation with high domain purity. However, BDT-Th10, which contained 10% BDT-Th units, simultaneously showed both high miscibility with PC71BM and high crystallinity compared with BDT-Th30, resulting in an appropriate BHJ morphology with substantially suppressed aggregation even when processed at room temperature. As a result, large-area modules based on BDT-Th10 exhibited improved performance, with a PCE of 7.74%.
When the blended photoactive layers are prepared with more than two materials, the mechanism of their morphology evolution is governed by L–L or S–L phase separation. In many cases, both phase separation phenomena occur simultaneously, although the contribution of each phenomenon to film formation differs case by case. Therefore, the development of active materials should be based on a comprehensive understanding of the physical properties of the donors and NFAs, including intermolecular interactions between homo- or heteromolecules, the material's crystallinity and solubility, and the thermal properties. For example, if the interaction parameters between the donor and acceptor are large, extensive phase separation will be favored, which can lead to efficient charge transport but limited charge generation. Polymers with excessively high crystallinity usually result in a quenched blend morphology as a result of S–L phase separation, which is favorable for local charge transport in the crystalline polymer domain but leads to poor long-term morphological stability.

3. Morphology control by solution processing
Achieving an ideal morphology for high OPV performance only through the design and synthesis of donor and acceptor materials and optimization of their physical properties is difficult. In addition to being affected by the molecular structures of the donor and acceptor, the morphology of the active layer is affected by various factors such as the composition of the active layer,108–112 the solution processing conditions, and the device configuration.25,27,113 Therefore, developing appropriate processing methods to achieve the optimal morphology according to the properties of the active materials is important. Various approaches have been practically used for morphology control, including the selection of an appropriate solvent and additive for the film coating114–119 and post-thermal or solvent annealing.29,120–124 In particular, incorporating a third component into donor:acceptor binary blends is known to improve the morphology of NFA-based BHJ blends.24,125–129 The optimization of each method is sometimes closely correlated, and the methods affect each other. Therefore, morphology control can be a complex procedure. The following sections present strategies for BHJ structural tuning; in particular, we discuss various approaches recently developed for controlling NFA-based BHJ films.
3.1 Morphology control by ternary systems
Ternary solar cells are OPV devices that include a third component in the donor:acceptor active layer. The third component is typically a donor (or acceptor) polymer and small molecule. Third components have typically been used to increase absorption coverage by active layers in the solar spectrum and to induce efficient cascading charge transport by controlling the energy levels.125,129–136 However, because of their characteristic physical properties, the third-component materials can induce changes in the BHJ morphology, including phase separation24,109,126,130,137–140 and the formation of micro- and nanostructures of donor or acceptor domains.134,141–146 These changes alter the CT and dissociation, charge carrier transport, and charge carrier recombination; thus, the key photovoltaic parameters (i.e., JSC, FF, and VOC) depend strongly on the introduction of additional materials. In many cases, the third components have been used to control phase separation between the donor and NFA and the crystallinity of the active materials.147 Therefore, the NFA OPVs incorporating the third component have shown improved charge generation and transport in BHJ films because their domain sizes and crystalline structures of each component have been optimized.108,141 However, despite recent intensive studies of ternary OPVs, the effects of the third component on the nanoscale morphology of the donor:NFA film are not fully understood yet because diverse chemical structures of NFAs induce much complicated interactions between the components in BHJ films. The performances of recently reported ternary OPVs are summarized in Table 1.

Fullerene derivatives have been representatively employed as the third component in the donor:NFA blend system because of their various advantages, which include high electron mobility, large electron affinity, and isotropic charge transport.110,148,149 Introducing fullerene derivatives into polymer:NFA blends can not only help improve light absorption and energy-level alignment but also optimize the BHJ morphology.24,110,149–151 FAs can be used as the third component to tune the morphology and nanostructure of polymer:NFA blends and thus, the BHJ film can fully utilize the individual advantages of both fullerene and NFAs. For example, fullerenes have been introduced as a phase mediator and transport channel to guarantee good electron transport. Zhou and coworkers reported a ternary BHJ film by adding PC71BM as the third component into the BTR:NITI binary system. PC71BM in the ternary blend provides a morphological framework; compared with the binary system, the BTR and NITI form a smaller size phase separation that fits within the PC71BM mesh network (Fig. 5a), and a hierarchical morphology, which is composed of PC71BM transporting highways and intricate NFA phase-separated small pathways, is obtained. Therefore, charge carrier generation and transport achieved an optimal balance and simultaneously voltage loss was reduced. As a result, the JSC and PCE of the corresponding OPVs were substantially increased from 13.8 mA cm−2 and 9.03% to 19.5 mA cm−2 and 13.63%, respectively.24 Hou and coworkers demonstrated that large aggregates observed in a PBDB-TF:Y6 binary film could be suppressed by introducing PC61BM into the PBDB-TF:Y6 blend. The optimal ternary film (PBDB-TF:Y6:PC61BM = 1:1.2:0.2, weight ratio), in which charge transport relied on the main transport channels formed by the Y6 and assisted by the PC61BM, demonstrated simultaneous improvements of the VOC, JSC, and FF, with a PCE of 16.5%.149 The introduction of a second NFA into polymer:NFA systems provides more opportunities for morphological engineering to achieve high-efficiency OPVs as a result of flexible control of the ternary blends' composition using various NFAs. Zhang and coworkers developed a method to control the phase separation of the PBDB-T:INPIC-4F blend films by incorporating MeIC1 as the third component, which has good compatibility with INPIC-4F NFA. Nanofibrous structures were observed in TEM images of the ternary blend films with incorporated MeIC1, which resulted in optimized phase separation and more balanced charge transport, as well as enhanced photon harvesting. Therefore, PBDB-T:INPIC-4F:MElC1 achieved an increased PCE of 13.73% with a high FF of 71.3%.130 Chen and coworkers reported an improved vertical phase distribution of a PM6:BO-4Cl BHJ film fabricated using a layer-by-layer (LBL) coating process. The addition of the asymmetric electron acceptor BTP-S2, which exhibits low miscibility with the binary PM6:BO-4Cl system, led to a vertical phase distribution in the BHJ film, where the donor- and acceptor-rich domains were located near the anode and cathode of the OPV devices, respectively. This phase distribution resulted in increased charge collection with diminished charge recombination; the PCE was therefore substantially increased to 18.16% with an FF of 78.04% from 17.11% with an FF of 75.4% for the binary system.25 The domain sizes in BHJ films have been reported to be controlled by adding NFAs as a third component, where the backbone structure of the NFA is similar to that of the acceptor in the binary blend but they have different molecular packing properties in the film. For example, Yan and coworkers reported a ternary blend film based on PM6:MeIC:ITCPTC BHJ. MeIC is a highly crystalline small molecular NFA, which induces excessive phase aggregation and large domain sizes for the PM6:MeIC BHJ film. By adding a structurally similar and less crystalline ITCPTC into the binary blend as the second NFA, the domain size and morphology of the blend is much improved without sacrificing the electron mobility of the blend (Fig. 5b). Therefore, the ternary OPV device showed an enhanced PCE of 14.1% with a substantially improved FF of 78.2%.143

An alloy formed between two donor materials with similar molecular structures has been reported to be effective for controlling the crystallinity, phase separation, and aggregation of BHJ films and, thus, improving the OPV characteristics. For example, Ge and coworkers demonstrated that incorporating a SM-Cl donor with a similar molecular structure but lower crystallinity compared with the donor into a BDT-based SM:IDIC BHJ film improved the phase-separated morphology, which led to improved JSC and FF of the corresponding ternary OPVs. As a result, the PCE was improved from 9.39% for the binary system to 10.29% for the ternary system.128 Peng and coworkers developed a ternary-blend PBDB-T:PTB7-Th:SFBRCN BHJ film by adding a PTB7-Th donor, where the two copolymer donors exhibited excellent miscibility with each other and good phase separation with the corresponding NFA. Because of improved morphology and multiple nonradiative Förster resonance energy transfer pathways that existed from PBDB-T to PTB7-Th and from SFBRCN to the copolymer donors, the resultant OPV device showed enhanced exciton dissociation and CT; the PCE was increased to 12.27% with an FF of 73.9% and a JSC of 17.86 mA cm−2.153 Jen and coworkers fabricated ternary NFA OPVs by introducing a highly crystalline polymer donor, P1, into PBDB-T:ITIC and PBDB-T:IT-M mixtures. The small portion of added P1 did not affect the length scale of the phase separation of PBDB-T:ITIC, but resulted in greatly enhanced crystallinity of the donor and acceptors in the blend films; the resultant ternary OPV devices showed improved charge carrier mobilities and suppressed charge recombination compared with devices based on the corresponding binary mixture, as shown in Fig. 5c. Consequently, the two types of ternary-based OPVs exhibited improved PCEs of 13.5% (PBDB-T:P1:IT-M) and 12.7% (PBDB-T:P1:ITIC), with substantially increased FFs of 77.83% and 78.07%, respectively.154
The donors and acceptors with various chemical structures can be utilized as the third component and practically applicable for optimization of the BHJ morphology. In the ternary system, the third components contribute to improving the charge dynamics of charge dissociation and transport mostly by fine-controls of the BHJ nanostructures such as the degree of phase separation and domain purity, and molecular packing structures of the donor and acceptor, although they sometimes directly participate in such charge dynamics.
3.2 Morphology control by additives
The introduction of additives can affect the morphology of a BHJ film during solution deposition. Small amounts of an additive in a precursor solution of an active film change the drying kinetics and time during coating and the wettability of the precursor materials on the substrates.42,67 Approaches using an additive have advantages over other processing methods. For example, morphological features can be easily fine-tuned by selecting various solvent additives with different physical and chemical properties, enabling effective manipulation of the molecular order and orientation of pure donor/acceptor domains and their degrees of phase separation.114,155–157 Recently, solvent additives have been demonstrated to not only work for processing fullerene-based BHJ systems but also for effectively improving the nanoscale morphology of NFA-based BHJ films.27,115,116 Therefore, importantly, solvent additives have been used to prepare high-performance NFA OPV devices.15,115 The other approach for optimizing the morphology of NFA-based BHJ films is using a solid additive such as volatile and non-volatile solid additives.117–119,158–160 In this section, we discuss the effects of the additives on the BHJ morphology and our current understanding of the different working mechanisms afforded by solvent and solid additives. We also introduce recent research progress in NFA-based OPV devices fabricated using additives for improving efficiency.

3.2.1 Morphology control using solvent additives. 
Solvent additives are mixed with the main solvent and typically have a high boiling point and selective solubility for the donor or acceptor molecules. Therefore, the solvent additive tends to remain in a film during the development of the BHJ morphology because it maintains specific interactions with organic active materials in the BHJ film.42,67,79 Such intermolecular interactions strongly influence the mechanism of the BHJ evolution and the nanostructures of the material domains in the film.161 The effects of solvent additives and the working mechanism on the BHJ morphology have been intensively studied using donor:fullerene systems because fullerenes consistently showed similar behaviors when being mixed with conjugated small-bandgap polymers due to their characteristic molecular structures.72,79,114,155,162 The performances of recently reported OPVs using solvent additives are summarized in Table 2.

One of the important roles of solvent additives is that they alter the phase-separation pathways of donor:acceptor blend films. In blend films, the processing additives effectively suppress the formation of oversized fullerene domains, which are formed because of L–L phase separation in various BHJ blends.72,79 For example, fullerene-rich domains with sizes of 100 nm have been reported to form in PDPP5T:PC71BM blends spun cast from pure chloroform (CF).
However, such aggregated oversized domains remarkably disappeared when a solvent system with 5% v/v 1,2-dichlorobenzene (oDCB) additive was used, as shown in Fig. 6a. In situ laser reflectometry studies of BHJ evolution have revealed that film drying occurs in two steps: one dominated by CF evaporation and one dominated by oDCB evaporation. At oDCB concentrations greater than 3% v/v, oDCB was found to induce polymer aggregation during spin casting, which occurred before the onset concentration of L–L demixing (∼20% v/v solute) was reached; this aggregation suppressed the over-aggregation of PC71BM domains. As a result, an enhanced PCE greater than 5% and a threefold enhancement of the JSC were achieved when 3% v/v oDCB additive was used.79

Many solvent additives have been used to improve the packing structures of polymer donors and thereby increase the size and purity of the corresponding domains.115,169,170 These enhanced packing structures drive the S–L demixing mechanism during BHJ phase separation; the solvent additive can decrease the energy barriers of nucleation and growth of polymer crystallization.67,98 The solvent additives can therefore be practically used for inducing phase separation of the blend films in cases where the donors and acceptors are intimately miscible. Hexemer and coworkers monitored the formation of P3HT:PC61BM BHJ films using in situ grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). The films prepared from pure chlorobenzene (CB) exhibited poor polymer ordering, as indicated by an isotropic amorphous scattering pattern in the GIWAXS image. However, in the case of a film prepared using CB and 3% v/v 1,8-octanedithiol (ODT), P3HT showed continuous growth of polymer packed structures after spin coating, resulting in an increase in the total scattering intensity of the polymer lamellar stacking peak. This is due to a reduced polymer nucleation barrier owing to the presence of ODT.156 Woo and coworkers reported a PPDT2FBT:PC71BM-based OPV device with a 290 nm-thick active layer that enabled strong light absorption and, thus, a high JSC without a decrease of the VOC or FF. This result was attributed primarily to the highly ordered organization of polymer chains into nanofibrillar structures (Fig. 6b). The diphenyl ether (DPE) additive enables the active materials to remain partially dissolved and makes PC71BMs diffusive for an extended period, which enables the polymer chain to self-organize into highly ordered structures. Consequently, an OPV device prepared with DPE as an additive exhibited improved charge-carrier mobility and, thus, an increased JSC (15.73 mA cm−2) compared with the corresponding device with DPE.155
NFAs can be prone to over-crystallization because of their rigid and planar molecular structures and easily undergo intimate mix with polymer donors because NFAs have interaction parameters similar to those of donors.6,187 Solvent additives often play an important role in optimizing donor:NFA morphologies; for example, they can control phase separation by controlling crystallization of the active materials and preventing aggregation of the active materials.26,157 In particular, the variety of NFA chemical structures enables a more diverse application of solvent additives for achieving high-efficiency OPV devices.15,27 The DIO additive can trigger the crystallization of the donor or NFA by facilitating nucleation and growth. For example, blend films based on the PDI acceptor and the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 donor processed without an additive showed structural disorder and poor phase separation. By contrast, in blends processed with DIO, both p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and PDI exhibited increased structural order as well as increased phase separation, resulting in a device with a higher PCE (3.1%) than that of the device prepared without the DIO additive (0.13%) because of the substantial improvement in exciton dissociation into free charge carriers.168 A similar result was also observed for the PTB7-Th:ATT-1 system; introducing DIO into the blend led to enhanced phase separation and crystallinity of the ATT-1 NFA in the thin film.157
Pseudo-planar heterojunction (PPHJ) OPVs with PM6 and IT-4F as the electron donor:acceptor pair were developed using the solvent additive DIO and an LBL method. In a PPHJ OPV device, incorporating DIO into the upper layer (IT-4F) strongly influenced the morphology of the active layers compared with those in a device in which DIO was incorporated into the lower PM6 layer, suggesting that the DIO more strongly affected the IT-4F than the PM6 (Fig. 6c). The existence of DIO in the solvent extended the drying process of the thin film and thus, the IT-4F had sufficient time to form large crystallites. Therefore, compared with the BHJ system of PM6:IT-4F, the PPHJ blend film exhibited appropriate crystallinity, with balanced crystal sizes between PM6 and IT-4F, which contributed to the improved PCE of 13.7% with an FF of 75.9% of the corresponding OPV devices.27 The additive DIO also affects the molecular packing mode of A-to-D-type acceptors. Compared with additives that include conjugated units such as DPE and 1-chloronaphthalene (1-CN), DIO can interact more favorably with the alkyl side chains of a COi8DFIC acceptor, thus making the polymer side-chain sufficiently flexible to enable J-aggregation between the COi8DFIC backbones. Consequently, the PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC blend film showed improved charge transport and the PCE of the OPV device was improved to 12.9% because of the increase of the JSC to 27.4 mA cm−2.116 Meanwhile, the solvent additive DIO has been reported to effectively improve the morphology of NFA BHJ films processed using either spin-coating methods or printing methods. For example, Müller-Buschbaum and coworkers reported that, when a PBDB-T-SF:IT-4F blend film was prepared using meniscus-guided slot-die coating, the addition of DIO improved the interfacial area between the polymer donor and the NFA because of the reduced average domain size. Consequently, the OPV device prepared by adding 0.25% v/v DIO additive showed improved CT and generation, and an increased JSC of 19.46 mA cm−2, resulting in a PCE of 8.95%.169
Halogenated solvents and additives are generally not acceptable from the perspective of industrial-scale device processing because of safety and environmental concerns.188 Numerous investigations involving non-halogenated solvents and additives for OPV preparation have been reported.189,190 Welch and coworkers successfully controlled the phase separation of PBDB-TF:ITIC-Cl4 blend film by processing the films using a small amount of 1-CN as a solvent additive. The resultant BHJ film was smooth but clearly featured a morphology with less aggregation of ITIC-Cl4 compared with the morphology of a control film without the additive. This morphology led to an increase in the photocurrent and to an OPV efficiency of 9.1%.26 Later, the addition of 1-CN as a solvent additive was also demonstrated to be effective for improving the molecular packing structures and, thus, the domain purity of a PBDB-T1:ITIC-Th blend film. Bimolecular recombination in an OPV device was thereby reduced and charge transport was increased because of the increased material crystallinity with induced face-on orientation. This resulted in an enhanced PCE of 9.6% and a substantially increased FF of 67.1%.170 Similarly, the introduction of the additive 1-phenylnaphthalene has been reported to effectively enhance the molecular ordering and phase purity of PM6:Y6 blend films, resulting in an increased PCE of 15.4% with an FF of 71.8%.115
Although solvent additives are beneficial for realizing high-performance NFA-based OPVs, they should be finally excluded as much as possible for the practical industrial-scale production of OPV devices because they can induce device instability and irreproducibility. Therefore, future material designs for the active layer should focus not only on the optical properties and electronic structures of OPVs but also on achieving satisfactory miscibility with counter-active materials and appropriate molecular packing properties that enable additive-free OPV processing.


3.2.2 Morphology control by solid additives. 
Recently, various solid additives, such as volatile and non-volatile solid additives, have been introduced into polymer:NFA binary systems. The solvent additives with high boiling points can remain in the BHJ film after device fabrication and induce morphology change, resulting in reduced device performance and stability.117,118,158,159 The solid additive in the NFA BHJ film can improve intermolecular π–π stacking and molecular packing structures of NFAs, which enhance charge transport in the OPV device. However, the volatile and non-volatile solid additives have not been practically used yet for optimization of the BHJ morphology in the NFA OPVs.117–119,158–160,191–193 Hou and coworkers developed a volatilizable solid additive (i.e. SA-1), which has a similar chemical structure to that of the end-groups of IT-4F NFA, for processing the BHJ film. The prepared film exhibited enhanced intermolecular π–π stacking, leading to improved electron mobility after thermal annealing at 140 °C. The SA-1 additive contributed to improved BHJ morphology by inducing self-assembly of IT-4F and ordered molecular arrangements; SA-1 could be removed from the active film during the TA process (Fig. 6d). Consequently, the OPV device prepared with 17.3% w/w SA-1 showed improved electron mobility and thus an increased FF of 76%.117 Non-volatile additives have been also used for optimizing the BHJ morphology in OPVs.158,191 For example, Yang and coworkers reported preparation of the NFA based BHJ film using non-volatile polymer additives with a high dielectric constant. The BHJ film processed with fluorinated polystyrene PPFS as the polymer additive showed decreased crystallite coherence lengths, which resulted in improved inter-miscibility between PBDB-TT5 and ITIC, and reduced surface roughness in the film. This can be attributed to the exciton separation and charge transport. Consequently, the OPV device prepared with PPFS as the solid additive showed enhanced exciton dissociation and balanced charge-carrier mobility, which led to an increased JSC and PCE.158

3.3 Morphology control using processing solvents
Processing solvents significantly affect the morphology of BHJ films and OPV properties. Several processing solvents have been representatively used to dissolve both components (e.g. donor and acceptor) and are mostly halogenated or aromatic solvents such as CF, CB, oDCB, toluene (TL), and o-xylene (XY).30,53,59,194–196 The phase separation and molecular packing structures in the BHJ film are strongly influenced by the processing solvent and conditions of solvent drying times, solvent polarity and boiling points, and the wetting properties on the substrate.30,59 Binary solvent systems which have different boiling points and show selective solubility for the donor/acceptor have been used to control the BHJ morphology.197–201 In this section, we introduce recent research progress in the solvent systems used for preparing NFA based BHJ films and effects of solvent selections on the BHJ morphology.
Before NFAs were practically used in OPVs, a lot of research trials were focused on studying the influences of the processing solvent on the polymer:FA morphology. For example, Heeger and coworkers investigated nanoscale phase separations of PCDTBT:PC71BM BHJ film using different halogenated solvents such as CF, CB, and oDCB. When CF and CB were used for preparing the PCDTBT:PC71BM BHJ film, large dark clusters with sizes of 200–300 nm were observed in the TEM and AFM images, resulting in decreased charge carrier generation and photocurrent due to the limited interface area. However, oDCB processing solvent notably induced small nanoscale phase separations with enhanced percolating network structures. Consequently, the PCDTBT:PC71BM film prepared using oDCB showed much improved charge transport and exciton dissociation, resulting in enhanced JSC and higher FF compared with CF and CB solvents.194 Liang and coworkers investigated the effects of the processing solvents with different boiling points on the nanomorphology of an NFA blend. The PTB7:PDI blend film prepared from a CB solvent exhibited large PDI aggregates with 1 μm domain size and 19.8 nm surface roughness; however the film cast using a CF solvent showed a negligible phase-segregated morphology with scattered fibrillar PDI crystals and 9.56 nm surface roughness. This suggests that the low-boiling point solvent such as CF effectively suppresses PDI aggregations, resulting in improved charge dissociation and transporting properties and thus increased JSC.202 Liu and coworkers monitored the morphology changes of Y6 NFA-based BHJ film depending on the processing solvent. CF solvent enabled PM6:Y6 to form uniform films with decreased phase separation. The PM6:Y6 BHJ film processed with CB exhibited a rough surface with irregular and large size phase separation whereas CF solvent enabled PM6:Y6 to form uniform films with decreased phase separation, which is due to the different vaporization time of the solvent during spin-coating the BHJ film. Therefore, the resultant PM6:Y6 BHJ film with a CF solvent showed improved charge separation and reduced energy loss channels and therefore, exhibited enhanced PCE of 16.5% with significantly increased JSC of 26.5 mA cm−2 and FF of 76.2% compared with the CB processed film.203
Mixed solvent systems prepared using two or more solvents have been used for realizing ideal BHJ morphology because donor and NFA materials show very different solubility behaviors in many cases, which affect the BHJ morphology. Furthermore, different boiling points between constituting solvents allow effective control of solvent evaporation kinetics of the resultant BHJ films. Chen and coworkers used a binary solvent consisting of CF and mesitylene (MES) for obtaining PTQ10:IT-4Cl BHJ film,199 where both donor and acceptor materials showed good solubility in CF; however, MES poorly dissolved the acceptor IT-4Cl due to the non-polar geometry of MES molecule and CF exhibited much faster evaporation compared with MES due to its higher boiling point of ∼165 °C than ∼60 °C of CF. As a result, the formation of IT-4Cl domains precedes that of PTQ10 domains during spin-casting of the BHJ film, which led to vertical phase distributions of the donor and acceptor in the film, and all photovoltaic parameters of the OPV device prepared using the binary solvent were simultaneously improved compared with those using CF.
Most high-performing donor and NFA materials have been processed with toxic halogenated solvents to form appropriate BHJ morphology15,54,204–207 and when non-halogenated solvents were used instead, the resultant BHJ films usually showed poor morphology. There were two different approaches provided as a solution: (i) finding novel donor–acceptor combinations which show good solution processability with non-halogenated solvents and (ii) synthesis of new donors and/or acceptors which render consistent morphology coated using various processing solvents. Ade and coworkers developed a donor–acceptor combination of FTAZ donor polymer and IT-M non-fluorinated NFA, which showed higher PCE of 12.2% when being spin-coated with TL compared with the case using CB (11.1% PCE).208 They also compared the crystalline properties of the blade-coated BHJ films processed using various non-halogenated solvents such as TL, XY, and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (TMB), and found that decrease of boiling points in the order of TL < XY < TMB resulted in more face-on molecular orientations with longer (010) coherence lengths in the out-of-plane direction in the resultant FTAZ:IT-M blend films. Furthermore, the blend film processed using TL showed the highest domain purity with the shortest domain spacing among the blend films processed using various solvents. As a result, TL-processed OPVs using blade-coating achieved a higher PCE up to 11% compared with XY- and TMB-processed OPVs of 9.6% and 9.1%, respectively. The representative research result related to the second approach was reported by Huang and coworkers.53 They synthesized an NFA named DTY6, which has a similar structure to Y6 with modified branched alkyl chains, and fabricated OPVs using PM6 as a donor polymer. The BHJ morphology and device performance of the PM6:Y6 and PM6:DTY6 blend films were compared and as the processing solvent was replaced from CF to XY, the PM6:Y6 blend films showed more phase-separated features with larger domains and increased surface roughness from 1.2 nm to 5.82 nm for CF- and XY-processed blend films, respectively, due to excess aggregation of Y6. However, the PM6:DTY6 blend film showed relatively smaller changes in morphological features with surface roughness of 1.65 nm and 2.18 nm for CF- and XY-processed films, respectively. GIWAXS measurements revealed that the PM6:DTY6 blend films maintain similar crystalline structures when the processing solvent is switched whereas PM6:Y6 showed decreases in the π–π stacking diffraction peak. Accordingly, while the PM6:Y6-based OPVs showed a significant efficiency drop from 15.7% for CF to 10.8% for XY, PM6:DTY6-based OPVs similarly achieved high efficiencies of 16.3% and 16.1% for both CF and XY, respectively.
3.4 Morphology control by post-treatment
Post-treatment processing has been successfully used to tune the morphology of deposited active films.29,120,180 In particular, because active-film coating processes such as spin coating are very fast, the resultant films show a kinetically trapped state and thus do not form organized molecular packing structures with sufficient phase separation.124,165,209 Many cases do not fully reflect the physical properties of the donor and acceptor materials, including their solubility, crystalline properties, and intermolecular miscibility.42,61,80 Thus, as-cast films often cannot achieve optimal morphology for exciton diffusion, dissociation, and charge transport.30,210 For example, as-cast P3HT-based BHJ films exhibit poor OPV performance because of the low charge carrier mobility of amorphous polymer domains with a donor–acceptor intermixed state.120,122 In polymer:fullerene OPVs, post-treatment has been performed after coating the active film to further optimize the inherent poor film morphology (i.e., crystallinity, domain size, domain purity, and vertical phase separation) of the as-cast active layer to improve the OPV performance.43,211–213 TA, SVA, and post-solvent treatment have been representatively employed, and the post-treatments have been recently demonstrated to be important also for optimizing NFA-based BHJ systems.50,124,176,183,185 In this section, we discuss the post-treatment process used in OPVs; recent research progress toward controlling the morphology of NFA-based BHJs is described. The performances of recently reported OPVs by applying post-treatments are summarized in Table 2.
TA is one of the most practically used methods for controlling the morphology of polymer:acceptor active layers and is classified into pre-annealing and post-annealing. “Pre-annealing” refers to the process that immediately follows the coating of the active layer, whereas “post-annealing” is usually performed after all of the device fabrication steps, including the formation of the upper electrode, have been completed.29,174 Pre-annealing typically increases phase separation of the donor:acceptor and changes the nanoscale morphology, including the crystallinity of the active materials.171,173 For example, in a P3HT:PC61BM BHJ film, TA increases the crystallinity of P3HT and promotes the diffusion of PC61BM molecules into the amorphous P3HT region.214 This process results in nanoscale interconnected BHJ networks, which are favorable for efficient charge separation and transport and, thus, for improving the PCE of the corresponding OPV device. Meanwhile, an upside-down thermal annealing (DTA) processing approach was proposed to improve the conventional pre-annealing method.215–217 Zhang and coworkers applied the DTA process to four BHJ systems, namely, PTB7-Th:PC71BM, PTB7:PC71BM, PffBT4T-2OD:PC71BM, and PBDT-TS1:PC71BM.215 From GIWAXS analyses, it is found that the (010) diffraction peaks along the out-of-plane and in-plane directions were shifted to higher diffraction vector (q) values after applying the DTA process, indicating decreased d-spacing and more tightly packed π–π stacking of the donor materials. Such improved lamellar structures contributed to the enhancement of the JSC and FF of OPVs. In particular, the synergistic gravitational and capillary forces which were applied to the active layer during solvent volatilization redistributed the BHJ film, resulting in optimized vertical phase separation and therefore, the corresponding PffBT4T-2OD:PC71BM devices achieved a higher JSC of 19.23 mA cm−2 through the DTA process, compared with 18.89 mA cm−2 of the control device. Post-annealing has also been reported to increase the interface roughness between the metal electrode and the active layer, thereby inducing an increase in the interfacial area.214,218 This improved interfacial area effectively improved the charge collection efficiency and the internal light reflection and condensing ability of the OPV device, which resulted in enhanced OPV efficiency.
In the polymer:NFA BHJ system, most of the TA process consists of “pre-annealing”; however, the mechanism by which this TA process affects the BHJ morphology differs from that by which it affects the morphology of a fullerene-based film. FAs typically diffuse through the amorphous donor domain in a BHJ film during TA and the NFA in the blend film undergoes rearrangement to form a semicrystalline structure by using the polymer donor at the donor:acceptor interface as a nucleation site.29 Therefore, the TA process helps the BHJ film form highly crystalline and finer features of the acceptor domain by inducing nucleation of the NFA crystal close to the donor.176 This reorganization of NFAs facilitates exciton dissociation and charge transport.29,171–177,180 In other studies, TA accompanied by morphology control using solvent additives has been reported to synergistically suppress excessive crystallization and aggregation of the active material in NFA BHJ films.
Pfannmöller and coworkers demonstrated that the combination of a TA process and the introduction of 1.0% v/v DIO additive induced nucleation of ITIC at the PBDB–ITIC interface and improved its molecular packing structures (Fig. 7a).29 PBDB-T provided nucleation sites for ITIC because of the strong π–π interactions between PBDB-T and ITIC. Such π–π stacking between the donor and acceptor molecules also facilitated charge carrier generation within the mixed interface region and efficient charge transport in the ordered ITIC domain, thereby effectively enhancing device performance, with a PCE from 7.19% to 8.65%.

The TA process has also been used to induce phase separation between polymer donors and NFAs. For example, Tang and coworkers suggested that TA of a PTB7-Th:ITIC blend film spin-coated using a hot solution mixture is effective for optimizing OPV device efficiency.175 The aggregated NFAs obtained from the hot solution contributed to the formation of a bicontinuous nanofibril-like network, whereas appropriate phase separation was induced through the subsequent TA process. As a result, because of improved π–π stacking and phase separation, the OPV device showed an increased JSC of 15.13 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.72. Although the TA process is advantageous for finely controlling the morphology to improve the crystallinity of the active materials, the selection of an appropriate annealing temperature is important. For example, Upama and coworkers reported that annealing at excessively high temperatures caused large aggregation and phase separation of PBDB-T:ITIC, which led to localized states with different bandgaps in the BHJ film and, thus, a lower built-in field in the corresponding OPV device.177 Nyquist plots obtained by impedance spectroscopic analyses of the BHJ films thermally annealed at high temperatures showed a large low-frequency arc, suggesting severe charge accumulation at the donor–acceptor interface because of morphological disturbances at the bulk and surface of the BHJ film. Thus, setting an appropriate process temperature is important for the TA process.
SVA is performed by confining an active film and treatment solvent together in a closed system. Because the solvent evaporation rate during spin coating is relatively fast, relatively little time is available for forming a donor:acceptor blend film.165,209 SVA usually ensures a better BHJ morphology with improved molecular alignment of the active materials because the solvent vapor in the closed system typically slows the drying process of the BHJ film and provides sufficient time to control the morphology of the active film.124,213,219 Important factors affecting the BHJ morphology in the SVA process include the type of solvents and the SVA treatment time. In the case of a polymer:FA system such as P3HT:PC61BM, selecting a good solvent for the donor as the SVA solvent improves the donor's packing structures and charge mobility, which results in an increase in the current density and PCE.121 However, such an SVA process sometimes induces excessively large phase separation and, thus, limited charge dissociation at the donor–acceptor interface. Meanwhile, using poor solvents for the donors has been reported to result in the phase separation of a P3HT:PC61BM BHJ film, where domain sizes do not exceed the exciton diffusion length; thus, the corresponding OPV devices can achieve an even greater current density of 11.44 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 3.27% compared with 8.22 mA cm−2 and 2.66% for the corresponding devices prepared from the SVA using CF as a good solvent.121
Unlike the case of polymer:fullerene systems, in polymer:NFA blends, SVA solvents that demonstrate high solubility for both the donor and acceptor have been reported to be effective for improving the morphology of the blends.28,123,181,183–186 Wang and coworkers have reported the effect of SVA treatment on a PTB7-Th:ITIC blend film using two different solvents, namely, carbon disulfide (CS2) and acetone (Fig. 7b).181 Both CS2 and acetone exhibit low boiling points and relatively high vapor pressures; however, CS2 dissolves both PTB7-Th and ITIC, whereas acetone is a poor solvent for both. GIWAXS studies of blend films showed that the SVA treatment with a good solvent improved both the lamellar orientation of PTB7-Th in the in-plane direction and the π–π stacking of PTB7-Th and ITIC in the out-of-plane direction, which is directly related to the enhanced charge carrier mobility. By contrast, the SVA treatment using a poor solvent (acetone) resulted in reduced molecular ordering and only minor changes in the domain sizes and d-spacings. These effects led to imbalanced charge carrier mobility, which decreased the device performance of the OPVs. Similarly, Ade and coworkers studied the effect of the SVA treatment of CF solvent on the molecular packing properties of D18:Y6 and D18:IT-4F blend films.28 As a result of a 5 min CF SVA treatment of the D18:NFA blend film, the π–π stacking structure of the D18 was substantially improved and the π–π spacing of the D18 and NFAs was also reduced. These effects led to enhanced hole mobility, and the D18:Y6-based OPV device consequently showed a substantial improvement in its JSC from 23.97 to 27.14 mA cm−2, resulting in a high PCE of 17.6%.
The TA and SVA treatment methods can effectively increase the packing structures of the polymer donors and NFAs;123 however, in some cases, controlling their individual crystallinity to achieve a balance between the crystal growth of the donor and crystal growth of the NFA is difficult.28,181 In particular, the kinetic behaviors of the polymer donors and small molecular acceptors during the phase separation differed greatly because of their large difference in molecular weight. The preformed polymer network can inhibit the diffusion of small molecular NFAs during the TA treatment.176 If a good solvent for both the donor and the acceptor is used for the SVA treatment of the blend film, crystallization and reorganization of both materials occur simultaneously; however, the polymer chain movement during the molecular rearrangement can disturb the uniform crystal growth of the NFA because of the high molecular weight of the polymer.123,175,186 Sequential control of crystallinity of the polymer donor and NFA by employing hybrid post-treatments has been reported to be beneficial for improving this issue.123,185,186 Han and coworkers developed a sequential two-step post-treatment approach of SVA and TA to control the crystallinity of a polymer donor and NFA in a PBDB-T:ITIC blend film (Fig. 7c and d).123 Tetrahydrofuran (THF), which can selectively dissolve ITIC (50 mg mL−1) in the presence of PBDB-T (<0.5 mg mL−1), was used as the SVA treatment solvent. Post THF SVA treatment of the blend film, the ITIC molecules freely diffused in an entire amorphous phase blend film; therefore, ITIC nucleation and growth preferentially occurred. When the film was subjected to TA, strong intermolecular interactions between the PBDB-T polymer chains led to improved π–π stacking of the PDBD-T. Consequently, the crystallinity of both PBDB-T and ITIC was improved and the PCE increased from 8.14% to 10.95%. Similarly, a PBDB-T:IDT2Se-4F blend showed improved morphologies of more pronounced interpenetrating networks with clearer and denser fibrous nanostructures compared with the corresponding blend without the treatment.185 Therefore, the OPV device based on PBDB-T:IDT2Se-4F exhibited improved charge separation and charge transport, which resulted in enhanced photovoltaic performance. The PCE increased from 9.84% to 11.19% because of the substantial improvements in the JSC and FF from 19.28 to 21.49 mA cm−2 and 63.0% to 65.9%, respectively.
4. Effect of coating method on morphology
The BHJ morphology from molecular-level to nanoscale structures is strongly influenced by film processing techniques, and several representative film-deposition methods have been used in OPV research.51 In small cells with an active area smaller than 1 cm2, spin coating has been most practically used to prepare BHJ thin films at the laboratory scale because this method is easily implemented to form homogeneous thin films with high reproducibility.220 For scaled-up production of OPVs, non-spin-coating-based methods such as meniscus-guided coating (MGC) methods have been developed to transfer high-performance BHJ films in small cells to large-area modules.57 MGC methods can be efficiently used to prepare industrial-scale electronic devices at low cost. Representative MGC methods used in the fabrication of OPVs include dip coating, blade coating, solution shearing, and slot-die coating. In the case of spin coating, relatively fast solvent evaporation occurs during spinning because of shear stress applied to the film. Therefore, the BHJ morphology is affected by the dynamics of active material solidification and solvent evaporation during film formation and is therefore governed more by kinetics than by the thermodynamic equilibrium state.221 In contrast, MGC methods are accompanied by slow evaporation of the processing solvent and, because of the inherent directionality of the coating process, can induce molecular alignment of each deposited layer.57
In this section, we discuss the preparation of BHJ films using spin-coating and MGC methods, and the effects of these coating methods on the BHJ morphology and photovoltaic properties of the resultant OPV devices.
4.1 Spin-coating method
Spin coating is one of the simplest and most readily available methods to prepare a uniform thin film; therefore, a tremendous volume of experimental results related to spin-coated thin films and the electronic devices based on them has been reported. The spin-coating process consists of four distinct steps: (i) solution casting onto a substrate; (ii) solution thinning by radial outward flow due to centrifugal force; (iii) ejection of the solution from the perimeter of the substrate; and (iv) further thinning and drying of the film by solvent evaporation.220 During spin coating, the solution of the active materials is subjected to two forces: the centrifugal force acting outward and the viscous force acting inward; these forces thus govern the film morphology. To understand the mechanism of BHJ film formation during the transition from a solution to a solid state, in situ GIWAXS has been used as a representative method for analyzing the morphological evolution in BHJ films as a function of time. The effects of the solvent additive on the morphological evolution during spin coating have been studied. Kramer and coworkers investigated the effects of ODT as a solvent additive on the dynamics of PCPDTBT:PC71BM BHJ film formation during a spin-coating process.222 They found that the addition of ODT to a chlorobenzene-based BHJ solution delayed film drying during spinning because of its high boiling point, which provided more time for PCPDTBT to reorganize and thus increased the crystallinity of the polymer. Amassian and coworkers reported the in situ analysis of P3HT:PC61BM BHJ films using time-resolved GIWAXS and GISAXS in conjunction with in situ spectral reflectometry.165 They observed that most of the casting solution was lost during the first second of the spin-coating process and that the solution remaining on the surface showed nonlinear thinning behavior during the spin-coating process, unlike the behavior during bar coating.223 They also found that the spin-coating process for a P3HT:PC61BM BHJ film comprised four distinct steps (Fig. 8a) and that the rapid lamellar formation of P3HT and the aggregation of PC61BM occurred simultaneously within 1 s. In addition, insufficient PC61BM content resulted in two-phase blends of P3HT lamella and an amorphous P3HT–PC61BM solid solution, whereas excessive PC61BM led to the formation of two-phase blends composed of an amorphous P3HT–PC61BM solid solution and PC61BM aggregates. However, when the optimal amount of PC61BM was introduced, a three-phase blend consisting of P3HT lamella, PC61BM aggregates, and a glassy P3HT–PC61BM solid solution was formed, which led to the OPV with the best PCE among the fabricated as-cast OPVs in the blend ratio series.

Bazan and coworkers investigated the effect of DIO solvent additive on the evolution of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM-based all-small-molecule BHJ films.224 Time-resolved in situ GIWAXS experiments confirmed that the introduction of a solvent additive led to a completely different film formation process. In the case of BHJ films without a solvent additive, p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystallites were formed ∼5 s after the spin-coating process was started and no further notable change in the structure was observed (Fig. 8b). However, in the case of the BHJ films with a solvent additive, a complex rearrangement of crystallinity was observed during spin coating. During the initial 20 s of the spin-coating process, metastable p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystallites with a large lattice spacing were formed, presumably because a p-DTS(FBTTh2)2–solvent complex or p-DTS(FBTTh2)2–PC71BM co-crystal was formed. The metastable intermediate phase consisting of p-DTS(FBTTh2) gradually transformed to the final structure for the subsequent ∼70 s. They concluded that the solvent additives in the blend solution facilitated transformation of the metastable polymorphs to more thermodynamically stable polymorphs, consistent with Ostwald's rule of stages, during spin-casting.
The crystallinity and morphology of the NFA-based BHJ films differ from those of fullerene-based BHJ films because the NFAs typically have anisotropic molecular structures, whereas fullerenes exhibit isotropic molecular structures and form relatively amorphous packing structures in films. Compared with fullerenes, the NFAs showed more complicated behaviors during BHJ film evolution because of their diverse molecular structures; consequently, predicting the morphology of NFA-based BHJ films is sometimes difficult. Li and coworkers reported the effect of the length of the donor polymer's side chain on the morphology of fullerene- and NFA-based BHJ films and the performance of the corresponding OPV devices.163 They synthesized three polymer donors—HD-PBDT2FT, OD-PBDT2FT, and DT-PBDT2FT—with different side-chain lengths and blended them with PC71BM or ITIC as an NFA to prepare BHJ films. With increasing length of the side chains, the PC71BM-based OPVs showed a dramatic decrease in EQE from 73% to 53% for HD-PBDT2FT:PC71BM and DT-PBDT2FT:PC71BM, respectively. However, the ITIC-based OPVs showed similar EQEs of ∼64%, irrespective of the length of the side chains. GIWAXS analysis revealed that the ITIC-based BHJ films exhibited similar coherence lengths of π–π stacking, domain sizes, and domain purities, irrespective of the length of side chains of the donor polymers, which resulted in similar EQEs for all of the OPV devices. The authors attributed such different acceptor-dependent behaviors to different film-forming mechanisms during spin-casting. Xu and coworkers also compared the morphology and crystallinity of fullerene- and NFA-based BHJ films prepared using spin-casting.166 They synthesized two small-molecule donors with identical backbone structures but different linear (BDT(X1)) or branched (BDT(X2)) side chains at the ends of the molecules. The BDT(X1) film exhibited better crystallinity than the BDT(X2) film. The OPV device based on PC71BM showed improved performance when spin-cast with low-crystalline BDT(X2) instead of BDT(X1) because the resultant BHJ film had more interpenetrating network structures with a distinct face-on orientation (Fig. 8c), which led to better charge separation and transport, thereby improving the JSC from 10.7 to 12.6 mA cm−2 for BDT(X1):PC71BM- and BDT(X2):PC71BM-based OPVs, respectively. By contrast, IDIC achieved better OPV performance when the acceptor was spin-coated with BDT(X1) because the BHJ film showed clearer face-on orientation with denser π–π stacking and a larger domain size, which facilitates better charge transport. As a result, the BDT(X1):IDIC-based OPVs showed a higher FF of 71% compared with 58% for the OPV with BDT(X2):IDIC.
4.2 Non-spin-coating method
The use of the spin-coating process for large-area deposition of BHJ films is limited because morphology control is difficult over a large area as a consequence of the non-uniform shear stress distribution during spinning.57 Non-spin-coating methods, such as doctor-blade coating, bar coating, dip coating, slot-die coating, roll coating, spray coating, maobi coating, and water transfer printing are representative coating techniques that can overcome such limitations.

4.2.1 Meniscus-guided coating (MGC) method. 
Doctor-blade coating, bar coating, dip coating, and slot-die coating methods belong to the meniscus-guided coating (MGC) technique that uses the meniscus of a solution formed between a substrate and coating head to control film deposition.57 Unlike spin coating, the MGC technique is a continuous and steady-state process in which solution loss is typically minimized to less than 1%. Therefore, the MGC technique is more suitable for mass production and is considered a more “process-friendly” technique than spin coating. In addition, the MGC technique enables the formation of uniform and molecularly aligned thin films because of the inherent directionality of the coating technique.225

In situ GIWAXS analysis has also been used in OPV research to investigate the mechanism of morphological evolution and crystallization of active materials during coating of a BHJ solution via MGC methods. For example, Lidzey and coworkers investigated the morphological evolution of PCDTBT:PC71BM BHJ films during a bar-coating process using GIWAXS in combination with spectroscopic ellipsometry.226 They showed that the morphology of PCDTBT:PC71BM BHJ films in which the concentration of the PC71BM is greater than that of PCDTBT can be generated via three different sequential stages as the solid content in the blend solution changes. (i) When the PC71BM molecules in the casting solution reach their solubility limit by solvent evaporation, they start to exhibit intermolecular aggregation, which is accompanied by a linear growth of the GIWAXS scattering peak associated with the PC71BM. (ii) Such coalescence of fullerene molecules occurs in the polymer-rich phase, thereby delaying the formation of the PCDTBT-rich phase. This phenomenon has rarely been observed in BHJ films in which the concentration of FA is lower than that of the polymer donors.227 (iii) PCDTBT molecules arranged around the PC71BM aggregate after PC71BM begins to aggregate and thereby form donor-rich phases when the drying process is close to the terminal stage. Bao and coworkers used various X-ray scattering techniques and optical interferometry to compare the morphological evolution of polymer:fullerene (P3HT:PC61BM) and polymer:polymer (P3HT:PNDIT) blends during blade coating.228 From the in situ GIWAXS analysis of P3HT, P3HT:PC61BM, and P3HT:PNDIT films, they found that the drying process by solvent evaporation of neat P3HT and P3HT:PC61BM films comprises four distinct stages: the dissolved state (stage I); nucleation and growth (stage II); the solvent-swollen glassy state (stage III); and the glassy state (stage IV) (Fig. 9a). By contrast, the drying of the P3HT:PNDIT film occurred in the absence of stage III. They speculated that P3HT chains showed different molecular mobility in each BHJ solution, which would affect the crystallization behavior of the P3HT and the morphological evolution at stage III. Furthermore, ex situ GIWAXS and R-SoXS analyses revealed that PNDIT formed a less-mixed phase with P3HT and suppressed excessive crystallization of P3HT when compared with the corresponding BHJ film of PC61BM. This suppression of excessive crystallization resulted in preferred phase separation between the P3HT and PNDIT, thereby enabling efficient charge separation and generation. Son and coworkers compared the effect of fullerene and NFA materials on the morphology of BHJ films prepared by bar coating.229 They investigated the phase-separation and crystalline structures of PBDB-T BHJ films blended with PC71BM and ITIC acceptors, respectively, using GIWAXS, R-SoXS techniques, transmission electron microscopy, infrared scanning near-field optical microscopy, and isothermal dynamic scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses. From the isothermal DSC analysis, they found that the crystallization behavior of ITIC was strongly affected by the processing temperature. As the processing temperature increased, the solvent evaporation rate during the blade-coating process increased, thereby suppressing the crystallization of ITIC, as evidenced by the decrease in the intensity of the peak corresponding to the ITIC crystallization (the area filled with a red diagonal pattern in Fig. 9b) in the DSC thermogram. The molecular packing of PBDB-T was improved simultaneously as the processing temperature was increased, which can disrupt the diffusion of ITIC crystallites, thereby limiting the crystallization behavior of ITIC. In the case of the slow solvent evaporation process at room temperature, a highly crystalline but excessively large ITIC-rich phase was formed, resulting in poor OPV performance. When the processing temperature was increased to 50 °C, the solvent evaporated before ITIC excessively aggregated. Thus, the BHJ film showed appropriate phase separation and crystallinity. Simultaneously, the molecular packing of PBDB-T was improved. As a result, the optimum temperature for the blade coating process was found to be 50 °C and the efficiency of the fabricated OPV modules with an active area of 58.5 cm2 was noticeably enhanced from 5.0% to 9.03% for devices processed at ambient temperature and at 50 °C, respectively.

Wang and coworkers studied the morphological evolution of PBDB-T:ITIC BHJ films during a bar-coating process and explained the mechanism on the basis of four distinct steps from stage I to stage IV,179 which is similar to the mechanism proposed by Bao. They conducted in situ analysis using spectroscopic ellipsometry and UV-vis spectroscopy to investigate the microstructure evolution in PBDB-T:ITIC blends during film drying after bar coating. The morphological evolution during the film drying process can be divided into four stages, as depicted in Fig. 9c. In stage I, solvents rapidly evaporate and PBDB-T and ITIC molecules approach closer to each other; PBDB-T and ITIC then begin to aggregate individually in stage II. During stage III, the organization of PBDB-T and ITIC molecules occurs rapidly, as indicated by the notable increase in the absorption coefficient of the PBDB-T and the red-shift of the absorption spectrum of ITIC. Finally, in stage IV, the PBDB-T:ITIC film forms dense packing structures during the evaporation of residual solvents.


4.2.2 Other coating methods. 
Besides the abovementioned coating methods, a variety of novel coating methods for realizing OPVs have been reported.230 The spray coating method uses printing ink-based fine aerosol sprinkled from a nozzle and the thin film is formed by drying the sprayed droplets on substrates. It is a prerequisite to precisely optimize the processing parameters such as substrate–nozzle distance, flowrate, pressure, bed temperature, ink concentration, and spray duration to form uniform thin film.231–233 Hou and coworkers compared the morphology of BHJ films processed by two different spray coating methods, namely, high-pressure gas spraying (HS) and ultrasonic spraying (US) and their OPV performance.234 It was revealed that the blend films processed by US showed more well-mixed morphology with better nanoscale crystallization but the blend films processed by HS showed improved absorption due to the microscale topography on the surface. To take full advantage of each coating method, the photoactive layers were formed by sequential deposition of HS and US. The combination of US and HS synergistically increased the efficiency from 6.2% and 4.87% of US- and HS-processed OPVs to 6.48% for PTB7:PC71BM blends, and from 7.64% and 6.6% of US- and HS-processed OPVs to 8.06% for PBDB-T:IT-M blends.
Painting is one of the oldest coating methods and it has been widely used in various fields, especially in the field of art. Zhou and coworkers painted photoactive layers on substrates with various blend solutions and maobi.235 Maobi is a Chinese ink brush made from animal hairs, and it has been used for writing and painting in Chinese history. They precisely tuned the active layer thickness by controlling the coating speed and temperature of the substrate. The maobi-coated P3HT:ICBA-, PTB7-Th:PC71BM-, and PBDB-T:ITIC-based OPVs prepared under conditions of optimal coating speed and substrate temperature showed a device performance comparable to those fabricated by spin-coating (10.24% and 10.08% for spin-coated and maobi-coated PBDB-T:ITIC OPVs, respectively). By utilizing the maobi coating technique, they demonstrated a PBDB-T:ITIC-based OPV module consisting of 14 sub-cells with an active area of 18 cm2, which exhibited a VOC of 11.6 V, JSC of 0.99 mA cm−2, FF of 55% and PCE of 6.3%.
Water transfer printing method is one of the promising candidates for the formation of uniform large-area thin films. Water transfer printing method utilizes thin films which are dried and floated on an aqueous substrate and then transferred on target substrates. The coating process can be summarized as three distinct steps: (i) spreading of the blend solution over the aqueous substrate, (ii) formation of a uniform thin film and quick drying, and (iii) transfer of the dried thin film onto the other target substrates.236 By calculating the direction of net surface tensions at the blend solution–water interface, the film formation behavior on the aqueous substrate can be predicted.237 Yang and coworkers reported the PM6:IT-4F and PM6:Y7-based OPVs using the water transfer printing method in air.238 By controlling the temperature of aqueous substrates from 10 °C to 40 °C, they optimized the morphology of the BHJ films. The temperature of the aqueous substrate significantly affected the drying kinetics and thermodynamics of the cast blend solution. The BHJ films at low water temperatures below 20 °C showed aggregated features, and a fibril-like structure was observed at the optimum temperature of 25 °C. The GIWAXS analysis revealed decreases of the (010) π–π stacking peak in the out-of-plane direction as the water temperature increases, which suggests reduced crystalline properties detrimental for charge transport. As a result, at the optimum water temperature, the PM6:IT-4F and PM6:Y7 OPVs prepared using the water transfer method exhibited PCEs of 11.13% and 13.83%, respectively.
In conclusion, the BHJ morphological evolution is typically composed of four sequential steps, irrespective of the coating method. However, the detailed mechanisms of BHJ formation during the coating process differ substantially depending on not only the coating method but also the molecular structure of the acceptor.239,240 The realization of high-performance, large-area OPVs fabricated on an industrial scale requires careful approaches that successfully transfer the optimized BHJ morphology in lab-scale spin-coated films to MGC-based or roll-to-roll-processed large-area films.164,241

5. Summary and outlook
The morphology of the active layer profoundly affects the performance of OPVs. BHJ films are usually formed through a complex mechanism because the final organization of the blend components in the BHJ films is affected not only by the material's properties but also by solution processes. Therefore, to explain the morphological evolution, we need to carefully consider both the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of film formation; the kinetic parameters that guide the morphology are the solvent composition, coating method, and drying process, whereas interaction parameters and crystallization/aggregation of the donor and acceptor materials determine the thermodynamics of the film. The diversity of the chemical structures of NFAs makes BHJ film formation unpredictable and more complicated compared with BHJs based on FAs, although they provide more opportunities for, e.g., extending the absorption area in the solar spectrum and reducing voltage losses. Such diverse structures of NFAs lead to versatile molecular stacking and aggregation of NFAs, which consequently determine the BHJ morphology of the photoactive layer. The aggregation of NFAs at large length scales also determines the phase-separated domain features. Therefore, devoting concerted efforts toward the development of organic active materials such as NFAs and solution processes is important for pursuing an ideal BHJ morphology for high-efficiency OPV devices.
Representative processing methods for control of NFA-based BHJ morphology were reviewed. Introducing a third component into the active materials induces a change in the phase separation and structures of the donor or acceptor domains from the molecular scale to the nanoscale; in addition, solvent additives can effectively adjust the mechanism of film formation during solution deposition, enabling tuning of the fine features of the blend films. Various methods have been developed to manipulate the morphology after deposition, including TA and SVA. Additionally, we emphasize that continuous efforts should also be devoted to fundamentally understand the complicated morphological evolution during deposition of NFA blend films by non-spin-coating techniques, such as MGC methods. The mechanisms of BHJ film formation are much different depending on both the coating method and the active materials. When large-area OPV devices are prepared under processing conditions optimized for spin-coating materials for small cells, substantial differences in morphology are sometimes encountered, resulting in a loss of efficiency.
The following research issues need to be solved with special attention for future OPV research: first, active donors and NFAs and non-spin-coating techniques compatible with large-area processes should be developed in an interdisciplinary manner to obtain optimal BHJ morphologies for high-performance OPV devices in a large area. This approach will lead to breakthroughs that enable the successful transition from high-performance OPV small cells to reliable large-area modules that can be produced on an industrial scale. Because the solution process using non-spin coating methods is typically accompanied by slow solvent evaporation, the BHJ morphology is more governed by thermodynamics rather than kinetics compared with a spin coating process and therefore, it is quite important to synthesize NFAs which show appropriate interaction parameter with the donor for ideal phase separation. Also, the small molecular NFAs which show high diffusivity compared with the polymer donor in the blend can easily migrate and form large agglomerates during the slow solvent evaporation, which can also prevent the polymer donor from forming effective packing structures in the BHJ film. Meanwhile, it is necessary to develop active materials which can form ideal BHJ morphology using non-halogenated processing solvents; this is particularly important when the coating process is performed at industrial-scale large areas.
Next, the stability of the NFA-based BHJ film morphology remains an important research challenge for realizing commercially applicable OPVs with high reliability. Many high-performing BHJ films undergo severe morphological changes under the conditions of increased temperature and light exposure because they are not thermodynamically stable and because their active materials are labile.22,242,243 Along with optimizing the morphology to achieve high efficiency, we should elucidate the degradation mechanisms of the NFA-based BHJ films and develop photoactive materials of donors and NFAs and processing methods that achieve both morphological stability as well as high device efficiency. If the challenges of performance, long-term stability, and scale-up of the BHJ morphology are fully addressed, the transition of OPV technology from lab-scale research to industrial applications will be greatly accelerated, representing a substantial advancement toward the commercialization of highly efficient and stable OPVs as a low-cost green energy source.
