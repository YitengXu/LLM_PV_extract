    , Accepted 18th January 2017First published on 19th January 2017AbstractElectrochemical splitting of water to produce oxygen (O2) and hydrogen (H2) through a cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and an anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a promising green approach for sustainable energy supply. Here we demonstrated a porous nickel-copper phosphide (NiCuP) nano-foam as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for highly efficient total water splitting. Prepared from a bubble-templated electrodeposition method and subsequent low-temperature phosphidization, NiCuP has a hierarchical pore structure with a large electrochemical active surface area. To reach a high current density of 50 mA cm−2, it requires merely 146 and 300 mV with small Tafel slopes of 47 and 49 mV dec−1 for HER and OER, respectively. The total water splitting test using NiCuP as both the anode and cathode showed nearly 100% Faradic efficiency and surpassed the performances of electrode pairs using commercial Pt/C and IrO2 catalysts under our test conditions. The high activity of NiCuP can be attributed to (1) the conductive NiCu substrates, (2) a large electrochemically active surface area together with a combination of pores of different sizes, and (3) the formation of active Ni/Cu oxides/hydroxides while keeping a portion of more conductive Ni/Cu phosphides in the nano-foam. We expect the current catalyst to enable the manufacturing of affordable water splitting systems.
Introduction
To fulfill the growing need for sustainable energy, the production of H2 fuel (i.e. H2 gas) by electrolytic splitting of water offers great promise as a renewable source.1–3 Efficient realization of H2 fuel production through electrolytic splitting of water requires the employment of high-performing catalysts in both the cathodic H2 evolution reaction (HER: 2H+ + 2e− → H2) and anodic O2 evolution reaction (OER: 4OH− → O2 + 2H2O + 4e−).1,4,5 At present, Pt and IrO2 are considered as the state-of-the-art catalysts for HER and OER, respectively.1,6 However, the high cost and scarcity of these catalysts limit their wide practical use in commercial water electrolysis applications. And consequently, well-engineered catalysts prepared using earth-abundant elements, such as Fe, Co, Ni and Cu, and their derivatives, come into prominence as affordable substitutes.7,8
Previous studies have shown that phosphides,9–13 sulfides,14–16 and selenides17,18 of earth-abundant metals can efficiently catalyze HER. On the other hand, Fe–Ni hydroxides,19–22 Co polytungstates,23,24 and several metallic alloy oxide nanoparticles25–33 are highly active for OER. Among catalysts containing earth-abundant elements, bifunctional catalysts are particularly attractive because they can catalyze both HER and OER in the same medium, which offers them a competitive advantage in building water electrolysers with one integrated catalyst for both cathodic and anodic reactions.34,35 Recently, a number of HER catalysts including CoP,36,37 NiSe,38 and NiPx39 were found to have a good catalytic activity for OER as well. It is proposed that their OER activity originates from metal oxides, metal hydroxides or oxyhydroxides, produced either in catalyst synthesis or through in situ transformation from phosphides or selenides.35,36,39
In addition to the chemical composition, several structural and physicochemical features of HER and OER catalysts are also critical for improving the efficiency of water electrolysers.40,41 First, maintaining a large surface-area-to-volume ratio helps to accommodate more catalytically active sites, leading to faster H2 or O2 generation. Second, achieving an optimum combination of pores in different sizes would allow a faster mass transfer, facilitating the supply of fresh electrolytes and the elimination and/or departure of coalescent H2/O2 gas bubbles. Third, conductive catalyst supports/substrates enable efficient charge transfer as many active catalysts have low electrical conductivity.19,21,42 Considering these requirements, hierarchically porous three-dimensional metal foams have emerged as a promising platform to construct efficient electrodes for the electrolysis of water.43,44 Such structures provide an inherently interconnected metallic skeleton with multi-scale porosities, which not only enables fast transfers of electrons, electrolytes, and gas bubbles but also offers strong mechanical robustness for long-term water electrolysis under high current densities. It is desirable to integrate bifunctional HER and OER catalysts into such metal structures.
Herein, we demonstrate a high-performance bifunctional catalyst developed by the phosphidization of a three-dimensional and hierarchically nano-foam of nickel (Ni) and copper (Cu) which we denote as NiCuP. We first created high surface area nano-foams of NiCu alloys on stainless steel foils by the electrodeposition method using H2 bubbles as templates instead of solid materials.45 Next, we activated the surface of these bimetallic structures creating a catalytically more active metal phosphide layer. The resulting stainless steel foil electrodes coated with the active NiCuP catalyst were tested for both HER and OER. Their long-term performance stability under high current densities was also evaluated. Subsequently, a solar cell powered water electrolyser was demonstrated using the NiCuP as both the cathode and anode for electrolysis of water.
Results and discussion
The NiCuP electrodes were fabricated using the two-step method as illustrated in Fig. 1. In the first step, stainless steel foils were used as substrates for electrodeposition of the NiCu foam. In aqueous metal salt solutions, when the cathodic overpotential reaches a sufficient level, H2 bubbles generated at the surface of the electrodes will interrupt the metal deposition. This phenomenon, called H2 bubble templated electrodeposition, has been explored as a novel method to create porous metal films.45 It can circumvent the use of hard templates, such as polystyrene spheres,46 surfactants47 and anodic aluminium oxide,48 and avoid subsequent template removal, also having the advantages of simplicity and scalability. During electrodeposition, if two metal ions are presented, bimetallic porous metal films can be generated. Bimetallic Ni and Cu nano-foams were used in this study for several reasons. First, Cu is one of the most effective elements at forming metal deposits by this method.49 Cu facilitates the formation of metal architectures much faster compared to using Ni alone. Second, Ni and Cu oxides are both active catalysts for OER.50,51 NiCu alloys may lead to higher OER activity due to their synergistic effects between Ni and Cu.6 Third, Ni and Cu phosphides are both active for HER.9,11 A recent study also found that Ni2P has a high activity for OER.39 We expected that the phosphides of NiCu alloys might offer even higher HER and OER activities.

The deposition of NiCu was tested under various conditions, including different deposition times (30 to 180 s), Ni concentrations (0.25 and 0.5 M), and Ni/Cu ratios (10, 25, 50 and 100). The optimized deposition was found at the current density of 1.8 A cm−2 for 90 s in 0.5 M NiSO4 and 0.01 M CuSO4. Under these conditions, a significant amount of H2 bubbles are released from the surface of the stainless steel foil and deposited NiCu alloys, which facilitates the formation of the hierarchical nano-foam (Fig. S1a in the ESI† shows a photograph of the deposited NiCu of 0.5 × 1 cm2 in size). After rinsing with DI water, the deposited NiCu was further anodized at 1.3 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in a 0.1 M NaOH solution for 30 s.52 Afterwards, it was exposed to a P precursor (NaH2PO2) at 300 °C for 60 min. The resulting stainless steel foil electrodes were loaded with 6.70 mg cm−2 of NiCuP catalysts (see Fig. S1b in the ESI for the photograph†).
The morphology of NiCuP was first examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The SEM image given in Fig. 2a shows the top view of a honeycomb structure resulting from the generation and dissipation of H2 bubbles during electrodeposition. Macropores of ∼5–8 μm in diameter are uniformly distributed across the surface with the average pore wall thickness of ∼2–4 μm. The thickness of the deposited layer is about 40 μm (inset of Fig. 2a). A dendritic structure can be observed in the high-resolution SEM image (Fig. 2b), which provides nanosize channels as nanopores that generate hierarchical porosity. Liquid N2 physisorption also confirms the formation of nanopores with a wide diameter distribution centered around 40 nm (Fig. S2 in the ESI†). The hierarchical porosity of this NiCu foam offers a high specific area to accommodate more electrochemically active sites. This can be assessed by the electrode surface roughness factor (RF) derived from the ratio between the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) and the geometric area of an electrode. Following an established method,6 the ECSA of the NiCuP was estimated by measuring its electrical double-layer capacitance (Cdl), which is about 9.9 mF. Assuming a specific surface capacitance (Cs) of 40 μF cm−2, the RF value of the NiCuP was estimated to be 494 (Fig. S3 in the ESI†). This RF value is much larger than those of other electrodeposited Co-based catalysts reported so far.35,37 It is also nearly two orders greater than those of commercial Ni foams, which are widely used as metal substrates for electrode fabrication.53 It should also be noted that low-temperature phosphidization treatment has a minor impact on the structure of NiCu foams. The SEM images of NiCu are similar to those of NiCuP in Fig. 2a and b (Fig. S4 in the ESI†). The RF of NiCu is 438, which is also similar to that of NiCuP. Moreover, the specific surface areas of NiCu and NiCuP measured by liquid N2 physisorption only differ by 5.4% (Fig. S2 and discussion in the ESI†), confirming that negligible structure changes have happened during the phosphidization treatment.

(c) XRD patterns of deposited NiCu and NiCuP. (d) XPS survey scans and (e) high-resolution XPS scans of P, Ni, and Cu of NiCu and NiCuP. 
The chemical structures of NiCuP were studied by various analysis techniques. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) areal mapping results indicate that Ni, Cu, O, and P are uniformly distributed in NiCuP (Fig. S5 in the ESI†). The atomic ratio of Ni and Cu determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) is 1:0.56. Fig. 2c shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of NiCu and NiCuP. The diffraction peaks can be assigned to copper phosphides and nickel phosphides on NiCuP according to the standard XRD patterns (Ni: PDF#04-0850, Cu: PDF#04-0836, Cu81Ni19 alloy: PDF#47-1406, NixP: PDF#03-0953 and CuxP: PDF#25-0302), confirming the formation of metal phosphides by NaH2PO2 treatment.9,11,54 The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey scans in Fig. 2d show Ni, Cu, and O peaks on NiCu. After the NaH2PO2 treatment, the intensity of the O peak decreases significantly, while P peaks emerge. As seen in the high-resolution XPS scans shown in Fig. 2e, two types of P species are found in NiCuP. The peak at 129.8 eV belongs to Pδ− in metal phosphides, and the other peak at a higher binding energy (133.1 eV) can be assigned to oxidized P species, such as metal phosphates (PO43−). The XPS analyses of Ni and Cu are relatively more complicated due to their complex chemical environments. As shown in Fig. 2e, after NaH2PO2 activation, the peaks centered at 852.9 and 932.9 eV belong to Niδ+ and Cuδ+ in metal phosphides. The other peaks with higher binding energies result from Ni2+ and Cu2+ in the form of phosphates. Overall, the XPS results show that the metal oxide layer on the surface of NiCu was transformed into a P-rich layer. XPS depth profiles of the NiCuP were also recorded to gain a better understanding of the P distribution in the catalyst. Ar+ bombardment is applied on the NiCuP electrode while the high-resolution XPS spectrum is collected every 20 s. The estimated thickness of the phosphide layer is around 6 nm (Fig. S6 and discussion in the ESI†),55 indicating that the phosphidization by the low-temperature method used in this study is limited to the very surface layers of the NiCu, which are metal oxide in nature.
The catalytic performances of NiCuP for HER were first evaluated in the H2-saturated 1 M KOH electrolyte in a three-electrode configuration using a Pt gauze as the counter electrode. Fig. 3a shows that NiCu has negligible activities for HER with a high onset overpotential at −191 mV vs. RHE. In contrast, NiCuP is highly active for HER with a small onset overpotential of −42 mV. The potential required to reach a current density of 50 mA cm−2 is only −146 mV. Cathodic H2 generation is clearly observed over the entire catalyst surface without rotating the electrode or agitating the electrolyte. The performance of NiCuP for HER was also compared with the commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst loaded on the carbon cloth electrode. With the rise of the overpotential, the cathodic current density of NiCuP shows a faster increase than that of Pt/C. Fig. 3b shows that Pt/C has a linearly fitted Tafel slope of 97 mV dec−1, indicating that the rate-limiting step of this Pt/C electrode transited from the Volmer step to the Heyrovsky step. The Tafel slope of NiCuP is merely 47 mV dec−1, indicating that its rate-limiting step approaches the Heyrovsky step.56 This result shows that NiCuP is one of the best HER catalysts reported to date, comparable to a Co phosphide/phosphate film (53 mV dec−1),37 Ni5P4 film (53 mV dec−1),57 and Co–P film under 2000 rpm stirring (42 mV dec−1).35 A detailed comparison of HER catalytic performances of recently reported bifunctional catalysts is listed in Table S1 in the ESI.† A previous study reported that Ni phosphide has lower stability in an alkaline electrolyte used in HER.11 The stability of NiCuP was evaluated at a current density of 50 mA cm−2 for 120 h. As shown in Fig. 3c, the required overpotential has only increased by ∼8.9% after the 120 h electrolysis, indicating the excellent stability of NiCuP for HER.

(d) OER polarization LSV scan curves, (e) Tafel plots, and (f) chronopotentiometric stability test and a multi-step test from 50 to 500 mA cm−2 with an increment of 50 mA cm−2 per step. Stability tests are performed in a two-chamber electrochemical cell separated with 4 mm glass grit without iR-compensation. 
Next, catalytic performances of NiCuP for OER were tested in the O2-saturated 1 M KOH electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 3d, there is a small peak at 1.43 V vs. RHE on the LSV scan curve of NiCuP, which can be attributed to the oxidation of Ni(II) to Ni(III) oxyhydroxide.58 Further increase of the applied potential results in a more rapid increase in the current density, together with the release of a large amount of O2 bubbles in the electrolyte. The current densities of 50, 100, and 500 mA cm−2 were achieved at the overpotentials of 300, 318, and 403 mV, respectively. A commercial IrO2 catalyst loaded on the carbon cloth electrode was measured under the same conditions for performance comparison. The linearly fitted Tafel plots of NiCuP and IrO2 are shown in Fig. 3e. The OER onset potential of NiCuP was 231 mV. This value is slightly higher than that of the state-of-the-art IrO2 at 130 mV. Importantly, NiCuP outperforms IrO2 when the applied potential is over 1.50 V. The fitted Tafel slope of NiCuP is 49 mV dec−1, which is smaller than those of NiCuOx particles,6 Ni–Cu alloy58 and IrO2, indicating its superior OER performances. A detailed comparison of OER catalytic performances of recently reported bifunctional catalysts is listed in Table S2 in the ESI.†
The stability of NiCuP for OER was also tested in the 1 M KOH electrolyte at 50 mA cm−2 for 120 h. Fig. 3f shows that the required overpotential only increases by ∼9.4%, indicating excellent stability. In practical water electrolysers, OER is often limited by the mass transport of electrolytes and O2 bubbles. A multi-step chronopotentiometry response test was carried out to evaluate the mass transport properties of NiCuP under different current densities. The current density was amplified from 50 to 500 mA cm−2 with an increment of 50 mA cm−2, and maintained at each current density for 300 s. Fig. 3f shows that NiCuP has both quick and stable responses at different current densities with negligible perturbations in its performance, suggesting that its pore channels are not blocked by gas bubbles or disintegrated catalysts at the high current density. This can be attributed to its hierarchically porous architecture, good electrical conductivity, and mechanical robustness.
Ni and Cu phosphides or phosphates are usually not considered as active catalysts for OER.7 It is, therefore, interesting to understand the origin of the high OER activity of NiCuP. Recently, Stern et al. proposed that metal phosphides and phosphates are partially converted to metal oxides and hydroxides in alkaline electrolytes, which contributes to the high OER activity of Ni phosphides.39,57 We hypothesized that a similar chemical conversion occurs in NiCuP that enables its high OER activity. To verify this hypothesis, we examined NiCuP after a 120 h OER test using SEM. Fig. S7 in the ESI† shows its surface structure changes. Surface elemental analysis by XPS (Fig. S8 in the ESI†) indicates that the O content has significantly increased after the OER test, while the ratio between Ni and Cu remains almost constant. These observations suggest that O has been incorporated into NiCuP during the OER test. The high-resolution XPS spectra (Fig. S9 in the ESI†) of Ni, Cu and O in NiCuP before and after the 120 h OER test were analyzed to elucidate their structure transformation. The XPS spectra of Ni (Fig. S9c†) reveal that the intensity of the Niδ+ peak (at 852.9 eV) from Ni2P decreases significantly, while new peaks of Ni3+ from NiOOH at 854.6, 856.8, and 861.1 eV emerge after the OER test.59,60 Similar changes are also observed in the XPS spectra of Cu (Fig. S9d†). These results support the hypothesis that Ni/Cu phosphides are partially converted into highly active Ni/Cu oxides/hydroxides. The potential drop further supports this conversion at the early stage (within 10 h) of the OER stability test (see Fig. S10 in the ESI†), indicating the increase of the OER activity of NiCuP during the OER test.
Ni/Cu oxides/hydroxides are important for their high catalytic activity. An intriguing question is, what are the roles of P? After passivation, a thin metal oxide layer covers the NiCu electrode (denoted as NiCuO). The OER performances of the anodic passivized NiCuO and NiCuP are compared. Their LSV polarization curves are shown in Fig. S11 in the ESI.† NiCuP shows better performances than NiCuO, which indicates that P is critical for the high activity of NiCuP. Based on several previous studies, the following roles of P are proposed. First, metal phosphides in NiCuP can serve as fast electron conductive channels because metal phosphides are much more conductive than metal oxides (i.e., 104 S cm−1 of Ni2P vs. 10−10 S cm−1 for NiO).61,62 Second, during the formation of metal phosphides, abundant oxygen vacancies are created in the P-rich layer, which enhances the ion transfer.39 Third, potential synergistic effects may exist between metal phosphides and oxides/hydroxides, which further improve the OER performances of NiCuP.19
The catalytic performance results given above show that NiCuP is highly active for both HER and OER. The subsequent task is to match the cathodic and anodic reaction rates using this bifunctional catalyst to assemble a full water electrolyser unit.35 The performances of NiCuP as a bifunctional catalyst for both HER and OER is first tested by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a three-electrode configuration using a Pt gauze as the counter electrode. For performance comparison, Pt/C and IrO2 and a stainless steel foil without catalysts were also studied. Fig. 4a shows that Pt/C has a poor activity for OER, and IrO2 has a negligible activity for HER. In contrast, NiCuP is highly active for both HER and OER. Next, the OER performances of different electrode couples as working and counter electrodes are further compared in the 1 M KOH electrolyte with an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Fig. 4b illustrates the linearly fitted slopes of Tafel plots for several electrode couples: NiCuP//NiCuP, Pt/C//Pt/C, IrO2//IrO2 and IrO2//Pt/C (working electrode//counter electrode). The IrO2//Pt/C electrode couple shows the lowest onset overpotential. However, its Tafel slope (88 mV dec−1) is larger than that of NiCuP//NiCuP at 76 mV dec−1. Other electrode couples all display inferior performances (128 mV dec−1 for Pt/C//Pt/C and 227 mV dec−1 for IrO2//IrO2) due to their sluggish kinetics for either HER or OER.

Subsequently, a water electrolyser was assembled using two NiCuP deposited stainless steel electrodes in an H-shaped glass cell separated by a glass frit in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Water electrolysis in this water electrolyser was measured at 1.5 and 1.6 V, each for 10 h. As shown in Fig. 4c, stable working currents of 4.2 and 20.8 mA cm−2 can be maintained at both potentials throughout the test without iR-compensation. This performance is better than those of a number of recent total water splitting studies, including Co2B (10 mA cm−2 @ 1.81 V),63 FeSx//FeOx (10 mA cm−2 @ 2 V in 0.1 M KOH),64 NiCoO/NiCoS (5 mA cm−2 @ 1.65 V),65 Co–P (4 mA cm−2 @ 1.63 V),35 NiSe nanowires on Ni foams (10 mA cm−2 @ 1.62 V @ 1.63 V),18 NiFeCo LDH (10 mA cm−2 @ 1.62 V)22 and Co phosphide/phosphate films (10 mA cm−2 @ 1.61 V).37 Table S3 in the ESI† has listed a more detailed comparison with recently published results. The Faradic efficiency, which describes the efficiency of an electrochemical reaction in terms of the usage of total charge transferred into an electrolysis system, can be estimated by quantifying the H2 and O2 gases produced during the electrolysis. The gases produced from both chambers were quantified by gas chromatography (GC). A 2:1 molar ratio of H2 and O2 can be obtained throughout the process. Fig. 4d shows that the amount of gas produced matches well with the theoretically calculated values, indicating a nearly 100% Faradic efficiency of the water electrolyser. Another advantage of the NiCuP electrode is its compacted structure with a small thickness of 0.13 mm, which allows us to stack multiple NiCuP electrodes together. Integrated electrodes of 1.1 mm in the total thickness were fabricated by stacking five NiCuP electrodes using Parafilms as spacers (as shown in Fig. S12 in the ESI†). A two-electrode water electrolyser using such an integrated electrode can reach a much larger working current density of 93.2 mA cm−2 at 1.6 V, which is nearly 4 times higher than that of the water electrolyser using two single NiCuP electrodes. The large working current density is highly desirable for practical water electrolysis.
To further demonstrate the potential for practical uses, commercially available flexible Si solar cells (∼6% photon–current conversion efficiency) were used to power the water electrolyser as shown in Fig. 5a. The assembled unit can continuously produce H2 and O2 under direct sunlight (see video S1 in the ESI†). A repeated on–off test was performed under a solar simulator to quantify its capability in total water splitting. Fast and steady responses upon switching illumination can be observed from its current profile in Fig. 5b. A stable working current of 27.4 mA was obtained, and it remained stable during a 24 h test (Fig. 5c), which further confirms the stability of NiCuP. The photon energy to H2 conversion efficiency is about 4.2% due to the fact that the commercial solar cell has a relatively low efficiency (see Fig. S13 and discussion in the ESI†).34 Using high-efficiency solar cells could further improve the conversion efficiency from photon energy to H2 fuel.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated a bifunctional catalyst for water electrolysis with remarkable activity, strong robustness, and nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency. Hierarchically porous NiCu nano-foams of 40 μm in thickness and 6.70 mg cm−2 were directly deposited on stainless steel foils. It shows promising HER and OER performances with overpotentials of −146 and 300 mV to reach the current density of 50 mA cm−2 for HER and OER in 1 M KOH, respectively. These performances surpass those of commercial Pt/C and IrO2 catalysts. The bifunctional catalyst shows stable activity for at least 120 h under the current density of 50 mA cm−2. An ultrahigh current density up to 500 mA cm−2 can be applied without blockage of electrode channels by gas bubbles or disintegration of catalysts from electrodes. A two-electrode water electrolyser was demonstrated with a molar ratio of 2:1 for H2 and O2 produced from 1 M KOH. Additionally, the water electrolyser can also be powered by using a commercial flexible Si solar cell (with a photon–current conversion efficiency of ∼6%) to achieve ∼4.2% photon energy to H2 conversion efficiency under a 24 h illumination test. Overall, we showed that the H2 bubble template electrodeposition is a facile, efficient and scalable approach to obtain porous foams with high surface area. Through this method, bimetallic foams with tunable morphology and elemental composition can be obtained in a few minutes, and their surfaces can be easily activated by different chemical methods. Resulting nano-foams offer a high potential to serve as electrocatalysts not only in water electrolysis applications but also in other electrochemical systems such as batteries and fuel cells.
Experimental
Preparation NiCuP electrodes
The H2 bubble templated electrodeposition of NiCu alloys was performed using an electrochemical workstation (Princeton, VERSAStat 3) in an acidic electrolyte, containing 0.5 M NiSO4, 0.01 M CuSO4 and 1.5 M H2SO4 (saturated with N2). Polished stainless steel (SS316) foils (0.5 cm in width, and 0.05 mm in thickness) were used as deposition substrates, and 1 cm was immerged in electrolytes. A Pt gauze and an Ag/AgCl (filled with saturated KCl solution) were used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The electrodeposition of NiCu alloys was carried out in an H-shaped two-chamber electrochemical cell separated by a fine glass frit (∼4 mm in thickness) with the Pt gauze electrode and the stainless steel foil in different chambers to prevent Pt contamination from possible Pt stripping due to the high current density. Elemental analysis by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) showed no detectable Pt (detection limit at 0.1 ppm) in the deposited NiCu samples. The deposition current density was 1.8 A cm−2 and the deposition time was 90 s. After deposition, the electrode was thoroughly cleaned with DI water before a surface metal oxide layer was created by anodic passivation in 0.1 M NaOH solution at 1.3 V vs. RHE for 30 s. Afterwards, the NiCu deposits were phosphidized to NiCuP catalysts using a low-temperature chemical vapor deposition method in a two-temperature zone tube furnace. NaH2PO2 (Sigma-Aldrich, >99%) was used as a P precursor and loaded in a ceramic boat at a 200 °C zone, while the NiCu foam was placed in a 300 °C zone about 10 cm apart from each other. The reaction was carried out for 1 hour, and then the samples were cooled to room temperature under flowing Ar. The areal weight loading of NiCuP on the electrodes was ∼6.70 mg cm−2 determined by weighing the stainless steel foils before and before deposition. Two types of reference electrodes were also prepared by dispersing commercial Pt/C (20 wt% Pt on Vulcan XC-72) and IrO2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9%) catalysts on hydrophilic carbon clothes (ELAT, NuVant, USA).
Characterization
SEM and EDX characterization was carried out using a field emission SEM (JEOL, JSM-6700F). XRD patterns were recorded on an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker, AXS D8). XPS was performed on a XPS spectrometer (Thermo-Scientific, K-Alpha) equipped with an Al-Kα (1486.3 eV) radiation source. XPS depth profiles were collected with a 3 kV Ar+ ion beam bombardment on catalyst surfaces over an area of 2 × 2 μm2 in a total of 2000 s, and a spectrum was collected every 20 s.
Electrochemical performance tests
Electrochemical tests were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI, 660E). All reported potentials were calibrated to an RHE. KOH electrolyte (1 M) was saturated with H2 (for HER) or O2 (for OER) before each test. The overhead space of the cell was covered with a PTFE cap and vented through a 1/8-inch port to maintain a nearly constant pressure (about 1 atm) during the tests. For tests using the three-electrode configuration, a Pt gauze electrode and a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. LSV and CV tests were recorded at the scan rate of 5 mV s−1. LSV was tested with 95% iR-compensation. Tafel slopes were obtained at the scan rate of 0.2 mV s−1. During tests, gas bubbles can continuously dissipate to the electrolyte without stirring. The NiCuP electrode can work steadily at the current density as high as 500–600 mA cm−2. However, perturbations in the recorded current were observed at ∼300 mA cm−2 for Pt/C and 400 mA cm−2 for IrO2 electrodes, respectively. An H-shaped electrochemical cell separated by a glass frit was used as a two-electrode water electrolyser. The overhead space above the electrolyte was kept around 20 mL. During the electrolysis of water, gas products were collected every 30 min and analyzed using a GC (Agilent, 6890N).
Solar energy powered water electrolyser
Two pieces of commercial flexible Si solar panels (1.8 V open circuit potential (Voc), 6% photoconversion efficiency, ∼25 cm2 total illuminated area) connected in series were used to power the H-shaped water electrolyser. Controlled experiments were carried out using a solar simulator (an AM 1.5G filter and a 150 W xenon lamp with a power output of ∼50 mW cm−2). A shutter was used to control the light delivery to the solar panel. The potential and current were measured using a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation. The photon energy conversion efficiency was calculated according to a previously reported method.34
