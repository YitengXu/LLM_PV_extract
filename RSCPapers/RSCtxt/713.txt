    , Accepted 28th February 2018First published on 1st March 2018AbstractFully-conjugated styrylbenzoxazoles and styrylbenzothiazoles of BOAF24, BOACl24, BOACl35, BOABr24, BOABr35, BTAF24, BTACl24 and BTABr24 without traditional gelation groups could form organogels. It was found that introduction of chlorine atoms in the 2,4-positions of the phenyl group would improve gelation abilities, and benzothiazole derivatives exhibited better gelation abilities than benzoxazoles with a similar π-skeleton due to better π-electron delocalization. Interestingly, the organogel of BTACl24 could change into solution by UV light due to trans–cis isomerization, which could also induce morphological changes in xerogels. The smooth organogel nanofibers stretched out lots of thin ‘arms’ to hold together or to catch other nanofibers upon UV irradiation, so more entangled networks were generated. Moreover, TFA (trifluoroacetic acid) could induce a gel–sol transformation on account of the protonation of the benzoxazole or benzothiazole unit, accompanied by emission quenching. BTACl24 exhibited higher performance than BOACl24 in the detection of TFA because of its strong basicity. The decay time and the detection limit of BTACl24 in xerogel-based film towards TFA vapor were of 0.7 s and 0.3 ppm, respectively. Therefore, organogelation of non-traditional organogelators is a powerful approach to the fabrication of multi-stimuli-responsive soft materials, and provides a new method to generate more entangled 3D networks through photochemical reactions in xerogels.
Introduction
Low molecular weight organogels (LMOGs) fabricated from π-organogelators have received attention recently due to their potential applications in optoelectronic devices,1 chemosensors,2 field-effect transistors,3 and so on. It is well-known that π-gelators tend to form 1D aggregates directed by intermolecular interactions, especially π–π interactions,4 followed by intertwining into a 3D network, so that the π-gels are sensitive to external stimuli such as heat, light, chemicals, sound and mechanical forces.5 Compared to the traditional π-gelators, the synthesis of the non-traditional organogelators excluding the auxiliary groups of long alkyl chains, sugar, cholesterol or H-bonding units showed high atom economy.6 To date, the design of non-traditional π-gelators is still challenging because it is difficult to balance the intermolecular interactions of fully-conjugated compounds. Park et al. found that stilbenes bearing –CN or/and –CF3 self-assembled into nanowires driven by C–H⋯F and π–π interactions.7 Fan et al. reported a series of non-traditional π-gelators based on dendrons and dendrimers of poly(benzyl ether).8 Würthner and coworkers reported a perylenebisimide-based organogelator which lacks long alkyl chains and H-bonding units.9 Recently, our group has synthesized a series of non-traditional π-gelators based on the derivatives of tert-butylcarbazole,10 β-diketone/salicylaldimine difluoroboron complexes11 and fully-conjugated carbazolylvinyl benzoxazole,12 and found that the introduction of halogens could improve gelation abilities.13 In order to reveal the effect of halogen on the self-assembly of fully-conjugated systems, we have synthesized new styrylbenzoxazoles bearing different kinds of halogens in different positions in benzene rings except for BOACl4 and BOACl24, which have been reported in a previous work (Scheme 1).14 It was found that BOAF4, BOACl4 and BOABr4 bearing one halogen atom could not form any gel in the tested solvents. 2,4-Dihalogenstyrylbenzoxazoles of BOAF24, BOACl24 and BOABr24 showed strong gelation abilities compared to the corresponding 3,5-dihalogenstyrylbenzoxazoles of BOAF35, BOACl35 and BOABr35, respectively. Accordingly, 2,4-dihalogenstyrylbenzothiazoles BTAF24, BTACl24 and BTABr24 were prepared. Interestingly, they showed excellent self-assembling abilities compared to styrylbenzoxazoles with similar structures. Notably, the light-induced trans–cis isomerization of BTACl24 led to the gel–sol transformation and the morphological changes in the xerogel. This resulted in lots of thin ‘arms’ that were stretched out from the smooth nanofibers, and they would hold together or catch other nanofibers. The networks turned into a crisscross pattern. To the best of our knowledge, such phenomenon has not been reported elsewhere. It should be noted that the organogel of BTACl24 and BOACl24 could be destroyed upon the addition of TFA, accompanied by emission quenching on account of the protonation of benzothiazole and benzoxazole moieties. BTACl24 exhibited better performance than BOACl24 in the detection of TFA in solutions and in xerogels on account of its strong basicity. Although pyrene- and anthracene-based organogels are typical emissive soft materials, exhibiting enhancement of power-conversion efficiency of solar cells, circularly polarized luminescence and multi-responsive properties,15 the self-assembly processes were assisted by traditional gelation groups. Therefore, the organogelation of non-traditional organogelators becomes a powerful method to fabricate multi-stimuli-responsive soft materials, and we provide a new method to generate more entangled 3D networks through photochemical reactions in xerogels.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
Synthetic routes for (halogenated styryl)-benzoxazoles and (halogenated styryl)-benzothiazoles are shown in Scheme 2. They were prepared via Knoevenagel condensation reactions of 2-methylbenzoxazole/2-methylbenzothiazole with halogen-substituted benzaldehydes in THF using t-BuOK as a catalyst. The crude products were purified by column chromatography (silica gel) using ethyl acetate/petroleum ether (v/v = 1/10) as the eluent, and the yields were in the range of 42–80%. The target compounds were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, FT-IR and HRMS analyses.

Photophysical properties
The UV-vis absorption and fluorescence emission spectra of BOACl4, BOACl24 and BOACl35 in CH2Cl2 (1.0 × 10−5 M) are shown in Fig. 1. The absorption bands of BOACl4, BOACl24 and BOACl35 appeared at 327 nm, 331 nm and 329 nm, respectively, due to π–π* transitions. Meanwhile, the fluorescence emission bands at 402 nm, 410 nm and 404 nm were detected for BOACl4, BOACl24 and BOACl35, respectively. It is suggested that the number and position of the chlorine atom in the benzene ring had a less effect on the electronic spectra of styrylbenzoxazole. The slight red-shifts of the absorption and emission bands for BOACl24 compared with BOACl4 and BOACl35 resulted from the conjugation effects of two chlorine atoms in the 2,4-positions of the benzene ring. Similarly, the UV-vis absorption and fluorescence emission bands of BOABr24 emerged at 334 nm and 401 nm (Fig. S1 and Table S1†), respectively, showing a slight red-shift compared to the other two bromo-substituted styrylbenzoxazoles. For example, the absorption/emission bands for BOABr4 and BOABr35 appeared at 328 nm/399 nm and 329 nm/400 nm, respectively. In the case of styrylbenzothiazoles, the absorption and emission bands were red-shifted compared to the styrylbenzoxazoles with similar structures on account of their good π-electron delocalization. For instance, the absorption and emission bands of BTABr24 emerged at 340 nm and 420 nm, respectively (Fig. S2†). The fluorescence quantum yields (ΦF) of the synthesized compounds were in the range of 0.03–0.11 in CH2Cl2 using quinine sulfate in a 0.1 mol L−1 sulfuric acid solution as the standard (ΦF = 57%, Table S1†).

Self-assembling properties
As listed in Table 1 and Table S2,† the synthesized styrylbenzoxazole derivatives were soluble in CH2Cl2, chloroform, ethyl acetate, DMF and DMSO. BOAF4, BOACl4 and BOABr4 bearing one halogen atom could not form any organogel in the tested solvents. The dibromo-substituted styrylbenzoxazoles of BOABr24 and BOABr35 could form organogels in n-butanol with a critical gelation concentration (CGC) of 5 mg mL−1 and 10 mg mL−1, respectively; besides ethanol organogel could be generated from BOABr24. The above phenomenon suggested that the gelation ability of BOABr24 was stronger than BOABr35 to some extent. In particular, the dichloro-substituted styrylbenzoxazoles exhibited relatively strong self-assembling abilities compared to dibromo-substituted styrylbenzoxazoles since the organogels could form from BOACl24 and BOACl35 in petroleum ether, cyclohexane, methanol and ethanol with the CGC in the range of 2.9–6.7 mg mL−1 and 5.0–10.0 mg mL−1, respectively. Likewise, the gelation ability of BOACl24 was the strongest among the synthesized chloro-substituted styrylbenzoxazoles. It was clear that ca. 2.5 × 103 methanol molecules could be gelated by one BOACl24 molecule, so BOACl24 could be deemed as a supraorganogelator.13 Since the gelation abilities of 2,4-dihalogen substituted styrylbenzoxazoles were better than 3,5-dihalogen substituted styrylbenzoxazoles, we synthesized 2,4-dihalogen-substituted styrylbenzothiazoles (BTAF24, BTACl24 and BTABr24). Among them, BTACl24 and BTABr24 could self-assemble into organogels in petroleum ether, cyclohexane, methanol, and ethanol with a low CGC of 1.6–2.0 mg mL−1 and 2.5–6.5 mg mL−1, respectively, and they could also be recognized as supraorganogelators. The styrylbenzothiazole derivatives exhibited better gelation abilities than styrylbenzoxazoles with similar molecular structures. This conclusion could be further confirmed by the fact that organogels could be generated from BTAF24 in methanol and ethanol with a CGC of 6.7 mg mL−1 and 12.5 mg mL−1, while BOAF24 could form organogel only in cyclohexane with a high CGC of 20 mg mL−1. As a result, the introduction of chlorine atoms in the 2,4-position of the benzene ring and the good delocalization of π-electrons in styrylbenzothiazole would significantly improve the gelation abilities of non-traditional organogelators based on rigid π-conjugated systems. Moreover, the obtained organogels were stable for several months at room temperature and could be destroyed upon heating. If the hot solutions were stimulated by ultrasound again, organogels could be reformed.

As depicted in Fig. 2, SEM images of the xerogels formed from BOACl24, BOACl35 and BTACl24 in methanol illustrated that they self-assembled into lots of smooth nanofibers of diameters of 200–400 nm, which further packed into 3D networks. It should be noted that more nodes appeared in the xerogel of BTACl24 compared to BOACl24 and BOACl35, so it was in accordance with the conclusion that the gelation ability of BTACl24 was better than the others.

In order to investigate the driving forces during the gel formation, the time-dependent UV-vis absorption and fluorescence emission spectra of BOACl24 in methanol (1.1 × 10−2 M) upon cooling the hot solution, which was first stimulated by ultrasound, to room temperature were recorded. As depicted in Fig. 3, during the gelation process the intensity of the absorption band at 331 nm decreased gradually and no spectral shift was detected. Meanwhile, the emission band at 410 nm was intensified obviously, accompanied by a slight red-shift. In the organogel, the emission band emerged at 415 nm. It suggested that the π–π interaction had an effect on the formation of organogel.

The time interval is 15 s, and the arrows indicate the spectral changes from the sol to gel. 
To estimate the molecular packing mode in the gel state, the XRD pattern of the xerogel of BOACl24 obtained from methanol is given in Fig. S3,† which exhibited several strong and sharp diffraction peaks. In our previous work, we determined the single crystal structure of BOACl24 (CCDC 1526199),14 and found that most of the diffraction peaks in the simulated XRD pattern based on the single crystal structure were similar to those in the xerogel. Therefore, we deemed that the molecular packing modes were similar in the xerogel and in the single crystal. As a result, BOACl24 might adopt a parallel layered structure in the gel phase, in which H-aggregates were formed. The distance between the two adjacent molecular planes was 3.482 Å in the single crystal and a similar diffraction peak corresponding to a d-spacing of 0.37 nm emerged in the xerogel, because of the occurrence of π–π interactions. Moreover, we observed the distances of C–H⋯Cl (3.165 Å, 3.178 Å, 3.009 Å, and 3.250 Å), C–H⋯O (2.654 Å and 3.119 Å) and C–H⋯N (2.811 Å, 2.792 Å, and 3.648 Å) in the single crystal of BOACl24. It was deduced that the H-bondings of C–H⋯Cl, C–H⋯O and C–H⋯N might be also the driving force to direct the organogelation of BOACl24. It further suggested that the introduction of halogens would improve gelation abilities. Similarly, during the organogelation of BTACl24, the absorption at 338 nm decreased gradually. Meanwhile, the emission intensity at 418 nm was red-shifted to 425 nm and its intensity was enhanced (Fig. S4†). Therefore, π-aggregates were formed from BTACl24 in the organogel.
Additionally, the single crystal structure of BOACl4 (CCDC 1526206) could provide some information why it could not form organogel.14 The molecules adopted an anti-parallel layered structure, and the distance between the two adjacent molecular planes was 3.653 Å, so the π–π interactions between molecules BOACl4 were weaker than those between molecules BOACl24 in single crystals. The distances of C–H⋯O (2.809 Å, 3.588 Å, and 3.631 Å) and C–H⋯N (2.967 Å, 3.134 Å, and 3.534 Å) also illustrated that the H-bondings were weaker in the single crystal of BOACl4 than those in BOACl24. Therefore, BOACl4 could not form organogel as it originated from the weak intermolecular interactions.
Light responsive behaviors of the organogel and xerogel
In our previous work, we have found that the nanofibers generated from BOACl24 in the organogel could curl under UV light, which was driven by light-induced [2 + 2] cycloaddition.14 Therefore, we intended to investigate the light responsive properties of the obtained organogels. Although no visible macroscopic photomechanic effect was detected for the organogels of BOACl35, BOABr24, BOABr35, BTACl24 and BTABr24, we found that the organogels were destroyed into solutions upon UV irradiation, accompanied by the rapid disappearance of the nanofibers. As shown in Fig. 4 and Videos S1 and S2 (ESI†), when 365 nm light was employed to irradiate the middle part of the methanol organogel of BTACl24 in a tube from the left side, the irradiated part of the gel became transparent. After irradiation for 80 s, the tube was rotated 180° and further irradiated from the left side by UV light. The middle part in the gel changed into solution absolutely when the irradiation time was prolonged to 160 s. Even if the tube was shaken slightly or was turned upside down, the rest of the gel was intact and the solution was locked in the middle. After it was kept at room temperature for 40 d, both the part of gel and the part of solution were still retained at the original states. It further proved that the organogel was very stable. In addition, the changes in the nanofibers in the methanol organogel of BTACl24 induced by UV light were observed under a microscope (Video S3 in the ESI†), and they disappeared quickly when 365 nm light was turned on.
 Fig. 4  The gel–sol transformation of the organogel of BTACl24 in methanol upon irradiation by 365 nm light for different times, and the tube was rotated 180° after 80 s. 
To obtain an insight into the light-induced gel–sol transformation, the absorption and emission spectral changes in the methanol organogel of BTACl24 upon exposure to 365 nm light for 1 s were studied (Fig. S5a and b†). The absorption band of BTACl24 in the methanol organogel was located at 338 nm, and it was blue-shifted to 301 nm after irradiated by UV light, accompanied by the significant decrease in the absorption intensity. It was clear that the light-induced gel–sol transformation was not the reverse process of organogelation. As mentioned above, the gel formation of BTACl24 led to a decrease instead of increase in the absorption intensity at 338 nm, and no spectral shift was detected (Fig. S4†). Therefore, we deduced that the reason for the destruction of organogel of BTACl24 induced by UV light was different from the gel–sol transformation stimulated by heating. Accordingly, the UV-vis absorption spectra of BTACl24 in solution, which was obtained from the organogel by heating is shown in Fig. S5c.† It was clear that the absorption intensity at 338 nm was significantly enhanced upon the formation of solution from the gel phase by heating. Therefore, we deemed that a photochemical reaction might take place when the organogel BTACl24 was exposed to UV light. The fluorescence emission spectra also exhibited different responsive behaviors in the course of gel–sol transformation via the treatment of heat and light. The fluorescence emission band at 425 nm for BTACl24 in the organogel was blue-shifted to 416 nm in solution obtained via heating, and the intensity decreased by 40%. However, the emission intensity at 425 nm for BTACl24 in solution obtained from the organogel induced by UV light was decreased to a quarter of that in the organogel, and blue-shifted to 407 nm with a newly emerged shoulder at 388 nm. Thus, new species might be afforded from BTACl24via a photochemical reaction.
Consequently, the 1H NMR spectra of BTACl24 in methanol-d4 upon UV irradiation for different times were first recorded (Fig. S6†), and we found obvious changes in chemical shifts and the shapes of the peaks with prolonged UV irradiation. However, it was difficult to figure out the changes of the signals for H atoms, so the 1H NMR spectra of BTACl24 in DMSO-d6 upon UV irradiation are given in Fig. 5. We found that the chemical shifts for H1 and H2 in BTACl24 appeared at 7.87 ppm and 7.76 ppm, respectively, before UV irradiation, and the coupling constant was 16.0 Hz, suggesting the trans-form of the carbon–carbon double bond. After UV irradiation for 15 s, their integral values decreased. Meanwhile, new peaks at 7.97 ppm and 7.90 ppm with a coupling constant of 8.0 Hz emerged, which could be assigned to H4 and H3, respectively, in the cis-form BTACl24. After irradiation for 80 s, the signals of H1 and H2 disappeared completely. We inferred that the trans–cis isomerization of BTACl24 took place upon exposure to UV light, which led to the gel–sol transformation of BTACl24.

On the other hand, we examined the morphological changes of the aggregates in the wet organogel and in the xerogel upon exposure to UV light. Firstly, the sample was prepared by adding the solution dropwise, which was obtained via UV irradiation of the organogel BTACl24 for 60 s, on a silicon wafer. From Fig. 2d, the aggregates in different shapes, including clews formed from fibrils, short nanofibers, rugged rods, small blocks and blobs, were observed. It indicated that the light-induced trans–cis isomerization of BTACl24 could lead to the disassembly of some organogel nanofibers and the destruction of 3D networks. Interestingly, many thin fibrils with a diameter of ca. 50 nm were spit out from the thick fibers (inset in Fig. 2d). The reason might be that the strains were yielded and accumulated on the nanofibers during the light-induced isomerization process. In order to release the strain, more thin fibrils escaped from the thick fibers. Hence, we deduced that UV light might result in the morphological change of the xerogel. As anticipated, after the xerogel BTACl24 was irradiated by 365 nm light for 20 min, the original smooth nanofibers stretched out lots of thin ‘arms’. Some ‘arms’ from neighboring nanofibers might hold together, and some ‘arms’ would stretch to other nanofibers and catch them. As a result, the networks became a crisscross pattern (Fig. 2e). What's more, a lot of blotches emerged on the surface of thick nanofibers, and they were deemed to be the growing points for the ‘arms’ so as to release the accumulated strains. It illustrated that the photochemical reactions of gelators in xerogels might become a new strategy for the fabrication of more entangled supramolecular networks, which has not been reported elsewhere.
Sensory properties towards acids in organogels and in xerogel-based films
Because benzoxazole is a weak base, we intended to investigate the sensory properties of styrylbenzoxazole towards acids. Herein, BOACl24 is first selected as a fluorescent probe on account of its good gelation ability and intense emission in the organogel and in the xerogel. As shown in Fig. S7,† the methanol organogel of BOACl24 emitted strong blue fluorescence centered at 415 nm. Upon the addition of 0.5 equiv. of TFA, the intensity of the emission for BOACl24 decreased and blue-shifted to 410 nm. When 1.0 equiv. of TFA was added, the organogel was destroyed and the formed solution exhibited a weak emission at ca. 400 nm. The emission was further decreased with an increase in the amount of TFA. The solution of BOACl24 was almost non-emissive when 2.0 equiv. of TFA was added. Therefore, the organogel could be used as a sensory material to detect acid by the naked eye.
It is well-known that the luminescent nanofiber-based films usually show a sensitive response to analytes due to the high specific surface area as well as efficient exciton migration in 1D nanostructures.16 Therefore, the fluorescence sensory properties of the xerogel-based film formed from BOACl24via organogelation were investigated. As shown in Fig. 6a, the emission at 435 nm for BOACl24 in the xerogel-based film decreased obviously upon exposure to TFA vapor. When the concentration of TFA vapor was 400 ppm, the quenching efficiency reached 90%. We found a linear relationship between the quenching efficiency and the concentration of TFA, and the detection limit was estimated to be 0.5 ppm. When the nanofiber-based film was exposed to saturated TFA vapor, the response time of the film was as short as 1.7 s. As a result, such a xerogel-based film could detect TFA vapor quantitatively, sensitively and rapidly. Similarly, the xerogel-based film of BTACl24 also exhibited excellent fluorescence sensory properties in the detection of TFA. As shown in Fig. 6c, the emission at 474 nm for BTACl24 in the xerogel-based film decreased obviously upon exposure to TFA vapor. When the concentration of TFA vapor was 300 ppm, the quenching efficiency reached 95%. Meanwhile, the detection limit and the decay time of the xerogel-based film of BTACl24 towards TFA vapor were estimated to be 0.3 ppm and 0.7 s, respectively. Thus, BTACl24 showed a high performance in sensing TFA in the xerogel-based film compared with BOACl24.

Inset: The concentration-dependent fluorescence quenching efficiencies of the film upon exposure to different amounts of TFA vapor for 2 s. (b) Time-course of the fluorescence quenching of BOACl24 in xerogel-based film upon exposure to TFA vapor at 1000 ppm, and the intensity was monitored at 435 nm.

(d) Time-course of the fluorescence quenching of BTACl24 in xerogel-based film upon exposure to TFA vapor at 1000 ppm, and the intensity was monitored at 474 nm. 
In order to reveal the fluorescent sensory mechanism and the differences in the sensory properties of BOACl24 and BOACl24 towards TFA in xerogels, an electronic spectral titration experiment was performed in CH2Cl2. As shown in Fig. S8a,† the absorption band at 320 nm for BOACl24 decreased gradually and the absorption band in the range of 340–420 nm was intensified with an increase in the amount of TFA. When 10 equiv. of TFA was added, a new absorption band at 355 nm appeared and its intensity increased with a further increase in the amount of TFA. The emergence of an isometric point at 330 nm meant the formation of new species, and we deemed that the benzoxazole unit might be protonated by TFA. Meanwhile, the fluorescence emission band at 410 nm for BOACl24 decreased gradually with an increase in the amount of TFA, and the strong blue fluorescence could be quenched completely when 500 equiv. of TFA was added (Fig. S8b†). Therefore, the emission quenching of BOACl24 induced by TFA in solution, in the organogel state and in xerogel was due to the formation of protonated BOACl24. On account of the increased electron-withdrawing ability of protonated benzoxazole, the intramolecular electron transfer would occur to quench the emission. BTACl24 gave similar fluorescence quenching behavior towards TFA in CH2Cl2 (Fig. S9b†). Besides, in the absorption titration process of BTACl24 towards TFA, two isometric points at 270 nm and 370 nm emerged, which demonstrated the formation of new species. Hence, we deemed that benzothiazole might also be protonated by TFA, which was the reason for fluorescence quenching.17 Meanwhile, we employed an online calculation method (http://supramolecular.org/) created by P. Thordarson to calculate the binding constant (ka).18a Since benzoxazole or benzothiazole (the host, H) has only one binding site with TFA (the guest, G), the fitter of the UV 1:1 system was selected for the calculation. Based on the plot of the absorption of BOACl24 at 310 nm, 315 nm and 320 nm versus [G]0/[H]0 in CH2Cl2 (Fig. S8c†), the ka for BOACl24 with TFA was estimated to be (4.47 ± 0.19) × 104 M−1. The ka for BTACl24 with TFA was (2.31 ± 0.11) × 105 M−1 according to Fig. S9c.† It indicated that the basicity of BTACl24 was stronger than BOACl24. Moreover, the fluorescence quenching data for BOACl24 and BTACl24 towards TFA were analyzed using the Stern–Volmer equation:18F0/F = 1 + Ksv[Q]where F0 is the initial emission intensity of the probe prior to the addition of the quencher, F is the emission intensity at a given concentration of the quencher [Q], and Ksv is the Stern–Volmer constant. The calculated Ksv values for BOACl24 and BTACl24 towards TFA were 9278 M−1 and 34325 M−1, respectively (Fig. S8d and S9d†). It suggested that BTACl24 exhibited stronger affinity with TFA than BOACl24, which was consistent with the conclusion made from the online calculation. Moreover, the detection limits (LOD = 3σ/Ksv) for BOACl24 and BTACl24 towards TFA were calculated to be 3.2 × 10−7 mol L−1 and 8.7 × 10−8 mol L−1, respectively in CH2Cl2. Apparently, compared with BOACl24, BTACl24 could sense TFA more sensitively in solution and in xerogel on account of the strong interaction with TFA.
Conclusions
In summary, new fully-conjugated non-traditional π-gelators based on styrylbenzoxazoles and styrylbenzothiazoles have been synthesized. It was found that the introduction of chlorine atoms at the 2,4-position of the benzene ring as well as the existence of benzothiazole with better π-electron delocalization would enhance the gelation abilities. 3D networks consisting of lots of smooth nanofibers could be fabricated via the organogelation process, and π–π interactions were the main driving forces for the gel formation. Interestingly, the organogel of BTACl24 could change into solution upon UV irradiation because of the trans–cis isomerization, which could further lead to the morphological change in the xerogel. The smooth nanofibers stretched out lots of thin ‘arms’. Some ‘arms’ would hold together, and some ‘arms’ would catch the other nanofibers. It should be noted that BOACl24 exhibited a strong fluorescence in wet organogel and in xerogel, which could be quenched by TFA. In particular, the decay time and the detection limit of BOACl24 in xerogel-based film towards TFA vapor were 1.7 s and of 0.5 ppm, respectively, and they decreased to 0.7 s and 0.3 ppm, respectively, for the xerogel-based film of BTACl24 due to its strong basicity. Therefore, the organogelation of non-traditional organogelators is a powerful approach to fabricate multi-stimuli-responsive soft materials and provided a new method to fabricate more entangled supramolecular networks via photochemical reactions of π-gelators in xerogels.

Measurement and characterization

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded with a Mercury plus instrument at 400 MHz and 101 MHz using CDCl3 and DMSO-d6 as solvents. Mass spectra were recorded with a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer GCMS-QP2010. FT-IR spectra were obtained with a Nicolet-360 FT-IR spectrometer by the incorporation of samples into KBr disks. UV-vis absorption spectra were obtained using a Mapada UV-1800pc spectrophotometer. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded on a Cary Eclipse Fluorescence Spectrophotometer. Fluorescence microscopy images were taken on an Olympus Reflected Fluorescence System BX51. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were performed on a JEOL JSM-6700F (operating at 5 kV). The samples for SEM measurements were prepared by casting the organogels on silicon wafers and then drying at room temperature, followed by coating with gold. X-ray diffraction pattern was obtained on an Empyrean XRD equipped with graphite monochromatized Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å), employing a scanning rate of 0.00267° s−1 in the 2θ range of 2° to 40°. The sample for XRD measurement was prepared by casting the organogel on silicon wafers and then drying at room temperature.
Preparation of organogels
