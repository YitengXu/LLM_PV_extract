1. Introduction
Water electrolysis is an electrochemical process that separates water (H2O) into hydrogen and (H2) oxygen (O2) in the presence of electrical energy. Water electrolysis can be classified into four main types, namely alkaline water electrolysis (AWE), anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE), proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) and solid oxide water electrolysis (SOEC). These water electrolysis cells are recognized by their electrolytes and ionic charge transfer (OH−, H+, O2−) although the working principles are similar across the technologies.1–6 The detailed technical specifications and a comparison of these electrolysis technologies are described in Table 1. The AWE is a well grown-up technology that has been wildly commercialized worldwide for industrial applications up to the multi-megawatt range. Alkaline water electrolysis operates at lower temperatures (30–80 °C) with an alkaline solution (5 M KOH/NaOH). Typically, Zirfon® membranes, nickel-based separators/diaphragms and stainless steel coated with nickel electrodes are used in alkaline water electrolysis.7,8 The functionality of the electrochemical reaction is provided by the hydroxyl ion (OH−), which permeates through the porous structure of the diaphragm along with KOH/NaOH and water molecules. Alkaline water electrolysis is a suitable system design for industrial and large-scale applications, design. However, it has some limitations such as restricted current densities (0.1–0.5 A cm−2) due to modest OH− mobility and challenges in handling caustic electrolytes.9,10 The KOH electrolyte is highly sensitive to atmospheric CO2, leading to the formation of K2CO3 salt on the electrodes. This reduces the amount of hydroxyl ions and ionic conductivity. The precipitation of K2CO3 salt closes the pores of the anodic gas diffusion layers and hinders the transferability of hydroxyl ions through the separator/diaphragm, resulting in decreased hydrogen production. Moreover, the current separators/diaphragms do not completely prevent the crossover of gases between the half-cells, leading to lower gas purity (99.9%).11 AEM water electrolysis has emerged as a technology comparable to conventional alkaline water electrolysis in recent years. The primary difference is the replacement of the conventional diaphragm (asbestos) with polymer matrix ion exchange membranes functionalized with quaternary ammonium salts. AEM water electrolysis operates with DI water and low concentrated (0–2%) alkaline solution (KOH) using noble and non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts at lower temperatures of 30–60 °C.12,13 On the other hand, solid oxide electrolysis operates with steam water at higher temperatures (500 – 850 °C), requiring less electricity to split the water into hydrogen and oxygen, thereby enhancing efficiency.14,15 This increase in energy efficiency has the potential to significantly reduce hydrogen costs, as electricity consumption is one of the major cost contributors to green hydrogen production.14–16 PEM water electrolysis is recognized as the most environmentally friendly and efficient technology for producing high-purity green hydrogen from water and intermittent renewable energy sources.17,18 Typically, sulfonated polymer membranes are utilized as the electrolyte in PEM water electrolysis, with H+ ions serving as the ionic charge carriers. The deionized (DI) water permeability plays a crucial role in facilitating the electrochemical reaction. PEM water electrolysis generally operates at lower temperatures (30–80 °C) with high current densities (2–4 A cm−2) and generates ultra-pure hydrogen and oxygen.19–22 Additionally, PEM water electrolysis offers numerous benefits over AWE, and AEM water electrolysis such as high energy efficiency, good practical load, compact system design, and quick response when integrated with renewable energy sources.23,24 Furthermore, the hydrogen evolution reaction in PEM water electrolysis exhibits faster kinetics compared to conventional alkaline water electrolysis due to the high surface area of the active metal surface of Pt electrodes and the low pH of the solid polymer electrolyte. Additionally, PEM water electrolysis is a reliable technology since it does not require a corrosive liquid electrolyte. Currently, the maximum reported stability of PEM water electrolysis is 100000 hours with negligible loss of performance.25–30 However, water electrolysis currently contributes only 2% to the global production of green hydrogen due to the high cost of hydrogen production (5–6 USD per kg of green hydrogen), primarily attributed to the use of expensive materials in water electrolysis. Therefore, significant advancements are required to minimize the cost of green hydrogen production. The current CAPEX of PEM water electrolysers is USD 587 per kW, and the targeted cost reduction is USD 200 per kW.31

To achieve the cost reduction goals, several issues need to be addressed, including the reduction of precious metal loadings. Currently, the loadings are 3.0 mg Ir per cm2 and 1.0 mg Pt per cm2, with an expected reduction to 0.25 mg Ir per cm2 and 0.05 mg Pt per cm2 without any performance degradation. Moreover, there is a need to replace precious metals with low-cost transition metals.33,34 Additionally, it is necessary to reduce the use of expensive protective layers (platinum and gold protective layers) on bipolar plates and explore new designs of flow fields using inexpensive materials. Furthermore, a reduction in membrane thickness can significantly improve cell efficiency. The current state-of-the-art membrane, Nafion® 117, has a thickness of around 180 μm, which results in an efficiency loss of approximately 25% at an operating current density of 2 A cm−2. However, reducing the membrane thickness to as low as 20 μm would lead to an expected efficiency loss of 6% at the same current density of 2 A cm−2. In this direction, in recent years, several public and private researchers worldwide have been actively working on the development of advanced low-cost PEM water electrolysers, including the development of electrode materials and membranes. The research trend of published articles on PEM water electrolysis is shown in Fig. 1.

2. Thermodynamics and the principle of PEM water electrolysis
Electrochemical water splitting or electrolysis, is an energy conversion process in which electrical energy is directly converted into chemical energy in the form of hydrogen and oxygen. Therefore, electrical energy is essential for water splitting, as it is equivalent to the energy released during the generation of hydrogen and oxygen from water. Consequently, Gibbs free energy can be used to determine the minimal amount of energy needed for water splitting.
The Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for water electrolysis is as follows: 
ΔG = μH2 (g) + ½μO2 (g) − μH2O
(1) 
= ΔG0 + RTln(pH2pO2)½
(2)where ΔG is the Gibbs free energy; μH2 (g), μO2 (g) and μH2O are the chemical potentials of hydrogen gas, oxygen gas and water molecules respectively; pH2 and pO2 are the partial pressure for hydrogen and oxygen at the ambient temperature and pressure respectively.
The reversible potential (Erev) of water electrolysis can be described using the Nernst equation: 
(3) 
(4) 
(5)where E0 is the standard potential under normal conditions (temperature: 298 K and pressure 1 atm), R is the universal gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, n is the no. of electrons involved during water splitting, F is the Faraday constant (96485 C mol−1), and Erev = 1.23 V is the minimal applied potential between the two electrodes (anode and cathode) for water splitting.
The enthalpy (ΔH), which is needed to support the water molecule, create the molecular bonds, and bring the reactants to their reference states, can be alternatively expressed as the energy balance for the electrolysis cell reaction. 
ΔG = ΔH − TΔS
(6)
Under standard conditions 
(7)
However, when water splits to generate hydrogen and oxygen, some entropy is generated. Therefore, using enthalpy (ΔH) rather than Gibbs free energy (ΔG) to calculate potential is preferable. By using enthalpy (ΔH), it is possible to determine the minimal potential required for water splitting, as follows: 
(8)where VTN is the thermo-neutral voltage, ΔS is the entropy change and T is the temperature.
Although energy conservation is governed by the first law of thermodynamics, it is essential to consider this principle when calculating the conversion efficiency of electrical energy into chemical energy. The efficiency of water electrolysis is typically determined using the higher heating value (HHV) of hydrogen, taking into account that water is supplied to the cell in its liquid phase during the electrolysis process. The efficiency can be determined using the following eqn (9). 
(9)where VTN is the thermo-neutral voltage and Vcell is the actual cell voltage.
Note: The efficiency of a water electrolyser can be calculated using the current density. When operating at lower voltages and lower current densities, the electrolyser efficiency can be increased.35
2.1 Faradaic efficiency
According to the Faraday law, the faradaic efficiency was determined from the ratio between the amounts of gas that were produced experimentally and the amounts of gas that were theoretically predicted to be produced based on the input.36,37 
(10)
The theoretical yield of hydrogen (H2) can be predicted according to Faraday's second law equation (3.17), which is given below under STP conditions in cubic centimeter per minute (cm3 min−1). 
(11)where VH2 is the theoretically predicted yield of hydrogen, VM is the ideal gas expression , R is the ideal gas constant (0.0821 atm K−1 mol−1), T indicates the temperature, P is the pressure (atm), t is the time in seconds, I is the applied current in amperes, F is the Faraday constant (96485 C mol−1) respectively.
3. Working principle of PEM water electrolysis
PEM water electrolysis is an electrochemical water splitting technique in which water is electrochemically split into hydrogen and oxygen at their respective electrodes such as hydrogen at the cathode side and oxygen at the anode side respectively. During the electrolysis process initially at the anode side, water molecules are split into oxygen (O2), protons (H+) and electrons (e−). The oxygen can be released from the anodic surface and the leftover protons and electrons are transported to the cathodic surface via proton permeable membrane and the external power circuit respectively. At the cathode, the protons and electrons combine to form hydrogen (H2) gas. The operating principles and reaction mechanism of PEM water electrolysis are illustrated in Fig. 2.

4. Major components of PEM water electrolysis
Typically, the PEM water electrolysis stack consists of a membrane, electrode materials (catalyst layers/electrocatalysts), gas diffusion layer/porous transport layers, separator palates/bipolar palates, and end palates, as shown in Fig. 3c.38,39 The PEM water electrolyser system and their major components, including cost contribution are shown in Fig. 3. The state-of-the-art materials for the PEM water electrolysis are illustrated in Fig. 4. Currently, the main cost contributor to the PEM water electrolyser system is still the cell stack, which accounts for approximately 45% of the total cost, followed by the balance of plant at 55%. The balance of plant includes the electricity and DI water costs, along with the engineering aspects of hydrogen processing and cooling systems, as shown in Fig. 3d.31

4.1 Membrane
State-of-the-art long side chain perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) polymer-based membranes such as Nafion®, Aciplex®, Fumasep®, and Flemion® were used as the polymer electrolyte. The chemical structures of various PFSA polymer membranes are shown in Fig. 5. Among these polymer membranes, thin (∼100 μm) Nafion® membranes (Nafion® 115, 117, 212) were conventionally widely used as solid electrolytes in PEM water electrolysis due to their high proton conductivity, excellent chemical and thermal stability and high mechanical strength under acidic conditions.41 Additionally, they exhibited high operating current density (5 A cm−2) with long-term stability.42 However, these Nafion® membranes have limitations in the operating temperatures and are also expensive. The cost of the membranes accounts for up to 21% of the total catalyst-coated membrane cost.31 Moreover, disposal is also expensive due to the presence of a fluorine-containing polymer backbone structure.43 Therefore, several researchers are actively working on development of cost-effective polymer electrolytes to overcome the limitations of PEM water electrolysis membranes. Wei et al. developed a solid polymer electrolyte membrane using sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) blended with poly(ether sulfone) (PES) and studied its performance in water electrolysis.44 The SPEEK/PES-blended membrane exhibited a current density of 1655 mA cm−2 at 2 V under 80 °C using Pt and Ir catalysts. Furthermore, many studies have already been carried out in search of hydrocarbon alternatives to Nafion® membranes, such as polybenzimidazoles (PBI), sulfonated polyphenyl quinoxaline (SPPQ), poly(p-phenylene), polysulfone membranes.24,45 In addition, short side chain perfluorosulfonic acid membranes such as Aquivion®, which contains zirconium phosphate and is a sulfonated poly-[(1-(4,4-diphenylether)-5-oxybenzimidazole)-benzimidazole] with an ether linkage polybenzimidazole, have also been studied in PEM water electrolysis.46,47 However, compared to typical Nafion® membranes, these alternative membranes have demonstrated comparatively lower current densities and durability. Very recently, in order to improve the mechanical and dimensional stability, Siracusano S. et al. studied a short side chain perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) Aquivion® membrane (50 μm thickness) reinforced by PTFE fibers. Furthermore, the performance of the reinforced Aquivion® membrane was studied in PEM water electrolysis using IrRuOx and 40% Pt/CB as anode and cathode electrocatalysts respectively. The results of the water electrolysis experiments show that the reinforced Aquivion® membrane exhibited better water electrolysis performance compared to extruded PFSA Aquivion® membranes. It achieved a recorded current density of 5 A cm−2 at a cell voltage of 1.8 V at 90 °C, with an energy efficiency of 80%. Additionally, durability studies were carried out for up to 3500 hours at a constant current density of 1 A cm−2 and 4 A cm−2. The reinforced Aquivion® membrane exhibited better stability, with an acceptable voltage degradation rate of 13.4 μV h−1, compared to the extruded PFSA Aquivion® membranes (degradation rate of 21 μV h−1). However, unfortunately, these results were not compared with conventional Nafion® membranes.48

4.2 Gas diffusion layer
The gas diffusion layer (GDL) is a layer located between the catalyst and bipolar plates, and it plays a key role in facilitating the diffusion of reactant water and gas in PEM water electrolysis. Additionally, the GDL serves multiple functions such as providing mechanical support to the membrane electrode assembly, enabling the electronic network between the bipolar plates and the electrodes (acts as a current collector), facilitating reactant and electron transportation, and protecting the catalyst layers from flow-induced oxidation and abrasion.49 Therefore, it is crucial to optimize the design of the GDL to ensure the even dispersion and removal of reactant water and electrons throughout the entire electrode region. As water splitting involves a heterogeneous reaction mechanism, where liquid and gas are mixed during the electrolysis process and oxygen molecules come into direct contact with the gas diffusion layers, it is important for the GDL to possess high corrosion resistance, good electrical conductivity, and optimum porosity. The properties of GDL, including the material type, surface structure, and thickness, influence its conductivity. In PEM water electrolysis, carbon-based materials such as carbon cloth, carbon paper, and carbon fiber are commonly used as cathode GDLs. Titanium and titanium-based materials like titanium foam, titanium mesh, sintered titanium, and titanium/stainless steel felt are used as anode and cathode GDLs due to their high conductivity and high corrosion resistance. Some SEM images of typical GDLs used in the PEM water electrolyser are shown in Fig. 6.50–52 Additionally, certain studies have also reported the use of stainless steel (SS316) mesh, Pt-coated SS316, and materials such as gold (Au), iridium (Ir), platinum (Pt)-coated titanium as anode GDL materials for short-term electrolysis operations.53–55 Among the various types of GDLs, sintered titanium powders are widely used in PEM water electrolysers due to their high rigidity and optimum porosity. Nonetheless, there are significant challenges associated with the high cost of titanium and the limited stability of certain anode GDL materials. The cost of GDLs accounts for up to 17% of the total stack cost.31,50 Furthermore, titanium-based materials are prone to passivation, resulting in the formation of TiO2 in the presence of generated oxygen. This passivation process leads to a significant increase in ohmic resistance and reduces the lifetime of the GDL. Therefore, there is a need to develop low-cost and highly durable GDLs with ideal porosity, pore size, thickness, and surface properties. Addressing these challenges is crucial for further advancements in PEM water electrolyser technology and its viability for commercial applications. The specifications of typical gas diffusion layers (GDLs) was given in Table 2.

4.3 Bipolar palates
Bipolar plates (BPs) are one of the most significant components in PEM water electrolysis. BPs, also known as separator plates, serve various functions, including supplying reactant water, removing resultant gases, and providing structural support to the gas diffusion layers. BPs are typically made up of titanium metals, with Pt- and Au-coated titanium plates being the most widely used materials in PEM water electrolysis. Titanium is chosen due to its high strength-to-weight ratio, excellent corrosion resistance, mechanical strength, high thermal conductivity, and low resistivity.56 However, the bipolar plates are the highest cost contributors in the electrolyser stack, which are responsible for around 53% of the total stack cost due to the material cost and manufacturing (machining for flow field) costs, which makes the more expensive of the stack cost. In this context, several researchers are still actively working on the development of inexpensive BPs by exploring various approaches such as substitution of coating materials, design optimization, and manufacturing of flow fields. For example, Hiroaki Wakayama et al. developed an inexpensive alternative to commercially available Pt-coated Ti bipolar plates by using Ti4O7-coated Ti. The Ti4O7-sputtered Ti exhibited a low contact resistance of 4–5 mΩ cm2.57 Another study by Lædre S et al. reported a novel bi-layer coating for BPs, consisting of a corrosion resistance tantalum (Ta) base layer and an electrically conductive indium tin oxide (ITO) top layer on titanium substrates. The developed Ta–ITO-coated titanium BPs that have been polarized at 2.6 VRHE showed an interfacial contact resistance of 503 mΩ cm2 compared to 15 mΩ cm2 for the sample polarized at 2.0 VRHE.58 Additionally, various metal compositions such as Au, TiN, Nb, NiTiP, Ti–Ag, Ti–Ag–N, and (Ti, Zr) N-coated titanium BPs have also been reported in PEM water electrolysis.59–62 In addition to coating materials, carbon-based graphite materials have been reported as bipolar plates for evaluating the initial performance of small-scale PEM electrolysers, particularly at voltages below 1.8 V. However, carbon materials tend to oxidize above 1.8 V, leading to the generation of CO2, decreased electrical conductivity, and reduced electrocatalytic activity. Inexpensive materials like aluminum, stainless steel, and copper have also been studied as alternative bipolar plate materials in PEM water electrolysers. However, these materials are susceptible to corrosion in highly oxidative anodic environments.63,64 Apart from material considerations, the design of the flow field (flow channels) plays a crucial role in bipolar plates. Flow channels are typically engraved on the surface of bipolar plates and serve to distribute reactant water uniformly, prevent local overheating on the catalytic electrode surface, and facilitate the removal of produced gases (hydrogen and oxygen) from the electrodes.65 Uneven distribution of reactant water on the electrode surface can lead to imbalanced utilization of precious catalyst materials and significantly decrease the overall cell efficiency. Therefore, proper design and manufacturing of flow channels in bipolar plates are essential to ensure uniform distribution of reactant water and provide a conductive path to the reaction sites, as well as facilitate the collection of produced gases. In this direction, several researchers have developed various flow field designs, including parallel flow fields, serpentine flow fields, point flow fields, porous flow fields, and more. For example, Toghyani et al. investigated different flow field designs, such as straight parallel, single-path serpentine, dual-path serpentine, triple-path serpentine, and quadruple-path serpentine, using a 25 cm2 active area in their 3D numerical analysis. The results showed that the single-path serpentine flow fields exhibited the best performance in PEM water electrolysers (Fig. 7). This was attributed to reasonable pressure drop, more uniform temperature distribution, and a relatively higher hydrogen production rate.66

4.4 Electrocatalysts for PEM water electrolysis
4.4.1 Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). One of the most significant electrochemical processes in heterogeneous catalysis is the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which is the cathodic half-cell reaction of water electrolysis. In the HER, the hydrogen adsorption and desorption processes typically involve two subsequent reactions on the catalyst surface. As a result, catalysts with low hydrogen binding energy are unable to efficiently absorb hydrogen, which is the initial step in the HER, while those with high binding energy have difficulty in desorbing hydrogen. Therefore, a perfect HER catalyst should possess optimal hydrogen adsorption and desorption energies. In this regard, Nørskov J. K. et al. studied hydrogen adsorption, and desorption energies on different metal surfaces and plotted a volcano plot, as shown in Fig. 8. According to the volcano plot, Pt exhibits higher adsorption and desorption energies, as well as exchange current, making it a more capable electrocatalyst for the HER.67,68 Therefore, commercially available state-of-art HER electrocatalysts are platinum (Pt) and Pt-based electrocatalysts for PEM water electrolysis because of their remarkable electrocatalytic activity under acidic conditions.
 Fig. 8  Volcano plot of exchange current density (j0) as a function of DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy (ΔGH*) of adsorbed hydrogen on different metals.68 
However, the large-scale production of hydrogen from PEM water electrolysis is restricted by two major problems such as (i) platinum is more expensive and has limited resources and (ii) lack of stability under strong acidic conditions. Therefore, enormous efforts are being devoted to the development of Pt-free electrocatalysts which can overcome the drawbacks of Pt-based catalysts. In this direction, several researchers are actively working on the development of Pt-free electrocatalysts. For example, Karikalan N. et al. (2019) designed a highly conductive sulfur-doped carbon-supported cobalt molybdenum sulfide composite material (CoMoS4/SDC) for the HER in PEM water electrolysis. The developed CoMoS4/SDC displayed exceptional HER activity, with a low Tafel slope of 48 mV dec−1 and an onset potential of 132 mV. Additionally, the HER performance was studied using a single-cell PEM water electrolyser, which led to a high current density of ∼110 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 220 mV. Further, the stability of the PEM electrolyser was investigated for 100 hours and showed no loss of catalytic activity.69 Muntean R. et al. (2020) developed a graphitic carbon nanofiber-supported ternary alloy catalyst (PtCoMn/CNF) for the HER in acidic media. The developed PtCoMn/CNF electrode exhibited a lower overpotential of 250 mV at 40 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 120 mV dec−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4, which is equivalent to those of platinum-based electrodes (Pt/CNF).70 Holzapfel P. K. et al. developed a noble metal free, highly efficient, and durable electrocatalyst of [Mo3S13]2− clusters supported on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (Mo3S13-NCNT) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and studied its electrochemical performance in a single cell PEM water electrolyser. The developed Mo3S13-NCNT has shown an elevated current density of 4 A cm−2 at a cell voltage of 2.36 V with reasonable stability (83 μV h−1) during the 100 hour durability test.71 Lazer et al. (2021) reported reduced graphene oxide supported Au and PdAu nanocomposites (PdAu/rGO) for the HER in acidic media. The developed PdAu/rGO electrocatalyst showed remarkable electrocatalytic activity and stability, with an overpotential close to zero and a smaller Tafel slope of 46 mV dec−2 with a low atomic percentage of Au and Pd.72
Further, precious metal-free graphene-encapsulated NiMo composites as an acid-durable HER electrocatalyst were reported by Tajuddin A. A. H. et al. (2021). In single-cell investigations, the prepared graphene-encapsulated NiMo composite demonstrated an exceptionally stable electrocatalytic activity during potential cycling tests of 10000 cycles and 100 hours of durability at a fixed cell voltage of 2.2 V.73 Furthermore, to improve the acid stability and impede the corrosion of non-noble metals of Ni and Cu, Hu K. et al. reported on the influence of proton penetration and charge transfer through the graphene layers on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) mechanisms in an acidic electrolyte (0.5 M H2SO4). The results demonstrate that increasing the number of graphene layers covering the metals significantly alters the HER performance of Ni and Cu. Additionally, the results demonstrate that both protons and molecular H2 penetrate by bypassing the defect sites induced by N-doping, making the catalysts covered by N-doped graphene electrochemically more active than those covered by non-doped graphene. Moreover, catalyst durability tests were carried out using cyclic voltammetry (CV) for monolayer and multilayer graphene-covered nano-noble metal (NiMoNP) catalysts. The monolayer graphene-covered NiMoNP catalyst dissolved during the 1000 CV cycles, whereas the catalyst with multilayers of graphene endured 1000 CV cycles. These results confirm that the protons reach the underlying metal surface and dissolve the nano-noble metal catalysts. Further, the results demonstrate that the corrosion resistance gradually increases, and the degree of proton penetration decreases with an increasing number of graphene layers.74 Kim J. et al. (2021) reported the use of mesoporous rhodium nanoparticles (MRNs) under acidic conditions for the HER. The proposed MRNs have an ultra-low overpotential of 29.4 mV, which is smaller than that of bare Rh black (33.8 mV) to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2. The MRNs also showed a reduced Tafel slope of only 30.9 mV dec−2 towards the HER, attributed to the high surface area of the MRNs with low-coordinated atoms.75 Furthermore, Urhan B. K. et al. (2022) proposed hierarchical Pd@PANI/Au nanofiber composite electrodes for the HER in an acidic environment. These electrodes were developed using a facile two-step electrochemical technique. The proposed Pd@PANI/Au composite electrocatalyst demonstrated superior electrocatalytic activity and stability, with an overpotential of 60 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2, as well as a smaller Tafel slope of 35 mV dec−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte solution. Furthermore, the composite showed remarkable stability during the 1000 CV cycling test and 20 hours of the HER under acidic conditions.76
Xie Z. et al. (2022) also studied defect rich 1T–2H MoS2 nanosheets (MoS2NSs) as HER electrodes with an extremely low loading of 0.14 mg cm−2. The results showed an extremely lower overpotential of 192 mV and a smaller Tafel slope of 44 mV dec−1. Furthermore, during the single-cell PEM water electrolysis experiments with the Nafion-115 membrane, a cell voltage of 2.25 V was observed at 2 A cm−2.77 Jang I. et al. (2022) developed a new titanium-supported molybdenum phosphide (Ti–MoP) electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction. The developed Ti–MoP showed a low overpotential of 81.5 mV at 10 mA cm−2 with remarkably improved stability in an acidic environment.78 Jiang W. et al. (2022) prepared CoP/Co3S4 hybrid implanted N, S, O-incorporated carbon sheets (CoP/Co3S4@NSOC) through pyrolysis followed by phosphorization techniques using metal–organic frameworks with 4,4-bipyridine and 2,5-thiophenedicarboxylic acid precursors. They studied the electrochemical performance of the prepared CoP/Co3S4@NSOC electrode in N2-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4. The electrode demonstrated outstanding electrocatalytic HER activity and a considerably lower overpotential of 132 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2. This value is significantly lower than that of Co/CoO/Co9S8@NSOC and Co-MOF precursors, as shown in Fig. 9(a)–(c). Moreover, the electrode exhibited stable electrochemical performance during 2000 CV cycles at 100 mV s−1 and 60 hours of chronoamperometric testing.79 King L. A. et al. developed a noble metal-free cobalt phosphide (CoP) electrocatalyst by a two-step bulk synthesis method. They studied the performance of the developed CoP electrocatalyst in lab-scale (1 cm2) and commercial-scale (86 cm2) PEM water electrolysers. The CoP electrocatalyst exhibited stable electrochemical performance, achieving a current density of 1.86 A cm−2 at 2.05 V and over 1700 hours of continuous hydrogen production, as shown in Fig. 9(d)–(f).80

Ranjith Kumar Dharman et al. (2022) constructed nickel-stimulated mixed phase (1T/2H) MoS2 through a solvothermal technique and studied its HER performance in an acidic medium. The developed nickel (9%) stimulated MoS2 demonstrated superior electrocatalytic activity in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. It achieved an overpotential of 127 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and exhibited a smaller Tafel slope of 86 mV dec−1.81 Very recently, Pérez G. et al. (2022) developed a carbon black decorated Rh-based organometallic catalyst for the HER with an extremely low metal loading of 0.0066 mg cm−2. The electrocatalytic activity of Rh/C was initially evaluated using the RDE method in an acidic environment (pH−1) and subsequently tested in a PEM water electrolyser. The results demonstrated a competitive cell voltage of 1.9 V with 0.5 A cm−2 at an operating temperature of 70 °C, with an ultra-low metal loading of 0.0066 mg cm−2 on the MEA. Additionally, these results were found to be equivalent to those obtained with conventional Pt-based catalysts under similar operating conditions.82 Apart from that, extensive research has been conducted on both Pt-based and Pt-free electrocatalysts for the HER under acidic conditions. The most promising electrocatalysts and their corresponding overpotentials are shown in Fig. 10. Additionally, a group of electrocatalysts has been studied in real-time PEM water electrolysers and the results are summarized in Table 3. Among these electrocatalysts, the Pt-based electrocatalyst Pt/NiFe@UTG (UTG: ultra-thin graphene) and the Pt-free electrocatalyst CoP/MoS2-CNT have demonstrated low overpotentials of 10 mV and 12 mV, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm−2.83,84 However, it should be noted that these results have not been studied specifically in real-time PEM water electrolyser applications.

4.4.2 Oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the anodic half-cell reaction in water electrolysis and holds great significance in both fundamental and industrial electrochemistry. It is known for being a four-electron proton-coupled mechanism, whereas the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) involves a two-electron transfer mechanism. Consequently, the OER requires more energy to overcome kinetic barriers.95 Moreover, compared to the HER, the OER mechanism and pathways are substantially more complex. In general, oxygen molecules do not evolve on the surface of bare metals, only evolved on the surface of metal oxides. As a result, the OER mechanism varies depending on the surface structures of different metal oxides. To understand the ability of various metal oxide surfaces to evolve oxygen and their transition enthalpies under acidic and alkaline conditions, researchers have explored and plotted a volcano plot (Fig. 11). This plot provides insights into the relationship between the O2 evolution capability of different metal oxides and their corresponding transition enthalpies.96 According to the volcano plot, RuO2 exhibits the highest rate of oxygen evolution among other metal oxides due to its low redox potentials and high metallic conductivity (104 cm−1 Ω−1). However, it suffers from poor stability under strong acidic conditions. IrO2, on the other hand, demonstrates better OER activity and strong corrosion resistance in acidic environments. As a result, iridium-based catalysts are currently recognized as the most promising and durable catalysts for the OER in PEM water electrolysis and are commercially used. However, one challenge with Ir is its rarity in the Earth's crust, with a prevalence of only around 0.000003 PPM. It is considered a secondary mining metal, meaning its production depends on the rates of primary metal production, such as platinum (Pt) and palladium (Pd).97 Additionally, the global demand and prices for iridium are gradually increasing.98 For instance, a 10 MW PEM water electrolyser would require approximately 15 kg of iridium with an expected catalyst loading of 2–3 mg cm−2 and operating at 1 A cm−2. The projected price of iridium catalysts under these conditions would be more than 2358000 € (157200 € per kg in August 2022).150 Due to these factors, academic and research organizations are placing more emphasis on reducing iridium loadings and exploring potential replacements for iridium-based catalysts in order to address the challenges associated with iridium scarcity and high costs.

For example, Jiang G. et al. (2019) developed an OER catalyst of Ir0.6Sn0.4O2 and studied its performance in a single-cell PEM water electrolyser. The developed Ir0.6Sn0.4O2 electrocatalyst demonstrated a cell voltage of 1.96 V at 2.0 A cm−2 with a reduced iridium loading of 0.294 mg cm−2. Durability tests were also conducted in a PEM water electrolyser for up to 100 hours of continuous operation at a constant current density of 1 A cm−2 at 80 °C, showing a reasonable degradation rate of 480 μV h−1.99 In addition, Lin Y. et al. (2019) developed an iridium-free OER electrocatalyst called Cr0.6Ru0.4O2, which was developed from metal–organic frameworks. The Cr0.6Ru0.4O2 catalyst demonstrated a lower overpotential of 178 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and maintained remarkable performance during the 10 hours of chronopotentiometric tests at a steady state current density of 10 mA cm−2. It also exhibited a small Tafel slope of 58 mV dec−1.100 Hao S. et al. (2020) designed a highly efficient OER catalyst of W0.2Er0.1Ru0.7O2−δ for PEM water electrolysis. This electrocatalyst exhibited an ultra-low overpotential of 168 mV at 10 mA cm−2, along with exceptional durability of 500 hours and a small Tafel slope of 66.8 mV dec−1 in acidic media. Furthermore, it operated steadily for 120 hours at a constant current density of 100 mA cm−2 in a single-cell PEM water electrolyser.101 Han S.-B. et al. (2020) reported on antimony-doped tin oxide (ATO) nanostructures decorated IrO2 as an OER electrocatalyst for PEM water electrolysis. The prepared catalyst showed superior electrochemical performance with a low overpotential of 256 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, compared to pure IrO2 (283 mV). Moreover, the results from the PEM water electrolysis experiments showed that the IrO2/ATO catalyst achieved a higher current density of 0.838 A cm−2 at 1.6 V, whereas the pure IrO2 achieved a current density of 0.799 A cm−2 at the same voltage of 1.6 V.102
Wang S. et al. (2021) proposed the use of iridium oxide supported with nitrogen-defective graphite carbon nitride (IrO2/N–CN) as an OER catalyst under acidic conditions. The proposed IrO2/N–CN catalyst exhibited higher mass and specific activities, being 7.86-fold and 1.75-fold higher than that of bare IrO2 respectively. Additionally, it demonstrated higher electrocatalytic activity compared to IrO2/CN and IrO2, achieving a current density of 1.6 A cm−2 at a lower cell voltage of 1.778 V, whereas IrO2/CN and IrO2 required higher cell voltages (1.846 V). The IrO2/N–CN electrode also exhibited excellent stability during the 300 hours of test operation at ae steady state current density of 1.6 A cm−2.103 Min X. et al. (2021) developed a highly efficient electrode material of IrOx/W–TiO2 for the OER in PEM water electrolysis, aiming to reduce the precious metal content. The constructed IrOx/W–TiO2 electrode demonstrated higher mass activity and electrocatalytic activity than commercial IrO2 in both half-cell and single-cell studies. It was achieved with a cell voltage of 1.602 V at a current density of 1 A cm−2, while reducing the precious metal loadings to ≤ 0.2 mg cm−2.104 Kaya M. F. et al. (2021) constructed a modified IrO2 catalyst by incorporating magnetic Fe3O4 to enhance gas separation during the OER process in PEM water electrolysis. The magnetized catalyst composed of 80% IrO2 and 20% FeO4 exhibited improved current density by 15% in half-cell studies using linear sweep voltammetry. In single-cell studies method conducted in PEM water electrolyser, it demonstrated a 4% increase in current density.105 Jiang G. et al. (2021) designed Ir film-decorated WOx nanorods (Ir@WOxNRs) as OER electrodes using electrodeposition techniques. The designed electrode showed outstanding performance, achieving a current density of 2.2 A cm−2 at 2 V. It also exhibited remarkable stability, operating continuously for 1030 hours. The noble metal loading of the electrode was reduced to 0.14 mg cm−2.106 Feng Y.-Y. et al. (2021) synthesized a highly efficient Cu-doped RuO2 electrocatalyst for the OER by one-step calcination of amorphous RuCu samples in an air atmosphere. They studied the performance of the catalyst under acidic conditions. The synthesized Cu–RuO2-300, with a calcination temperature of 300 °C, showed superior electrocatalytic activity and stability in acidic environments. The observed overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 was 201 mV, which is lower than that of commercial RuO2 (233 mV). Additionally, the Tafel slope of Cu–RuO2 was significantly lower at 55 mV dec−1 compared to the commercial RuO2 catalyst (76 mV dec−1). These lower overpotential and Tafel slope values indicate faster kinetics of the OER in acidic media. Furthermore, Cu–RuO2-300 demonstrated stable electrochemical performance during the 24-hour chronopotentiometry studies at a constant current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 0.5 M H2SO4.107
Zhen-Yu Wu et al. (2022) reported nickel-stabilized ruthenium oxide (Ni–RuO2) as an efficient and alternative electrocatalyst to traditional iridium-based electrocatalysts for the OER in PEM water electrolysis. The developed Ni–RuO2 electrocatalyst demonstrated remarkable electrochemical performance and stability in both half-cell and single-cell PEM water electrolysis tests. An observed overpotential of 214 mV was required to reach a current density of 10 Am cm−2, which is lower than that of pure RuO2. Additionally, a significantly smaller Tafel slope of 42.6 mV dec−2 was achieved. The electrochemical impedance studies revealed lower charge transfer resistance at the cell potential of 1.45 V, as shown in Fig. 12. Furthermore, in single-cell tests, the Ni–RuO2 catalyst achieved a cell voltage of 1.95 V to reach a current density of 1 A cm−2. The catalyst also demonstrated stable electrochemical performance during 200 hours of rotating disk electrode (RDE) tests and 1000 hours of chronopotentiometry studies.108

Zhang J. et al. (2022) reported Ru@Ir–O core–shell nanostructures with integrated oxygens and tensile strains in the Ir shell. These structures exhibited a very low overpotential of 238 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for the OER under acidic conditions. Additionally, a reduced Tafel slope of 92.6 mV dec−1 was achieved. Furthermore, the proposed electrocatalyst demonstrated a 78-fold higher mass activity compared to traditional IrO2.109 Chen L.-W. et al. (2022) proposed an iridium core–shell catalyst of IrGa-IMC@IrOx which is composed of the intermetallic IrGa(IrGa-IMC) core and a moderately oxidized Ir(IrOx) shell. The proposed core–shell catalyst exhibited a reduced overpotential of 272 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2, along with a reduced Tafel slope of 57.2 mV dec−1. Furthermore, it showed a greater mass activity (841 A gIr−1) compared to traditional Ir/C (231 A gIr−1) at a potential of 1.52 V with ultra-low loadings of Ir content (20 μg cm−2).110 Raja D. S. et al. (2022) developed a noble metal-free electrocatalyst of FeCo3O4@C/FTO for the OER and studied its performance in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. The developed catalyst has shown remarkable electrocatalytic activity in 0.5 M H2SO4 with a lower overpotential of 396 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a small Tafel slope of 68.6 mV dec−1 and demonstrated stable electrocatalytic activity during the 50 h continuous chronopotentiometric operation.111 Very recently, Joo J. et al. (2022) developed a highly efficient and durable electrocatalyst of Mn–RuIr NCT heterostructures for PEM water electrolysis. The developed Mn–RuIr NCT shows outstanding OER activity and stability with an ultra-low overpotential of 198 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and 247 mV at 100 mA cm−2 with a smaller Tafel slope of 45 mV dec−1, which is significantly smaller than that of without Mn doped RuIr NCT and the other control catalysts (IrO2, RuO2, and RuIr NPs). Generally, a smaller Tafel slope and lower overpotential indicate the faster kinetics of the OER. Further, durability was studied by the chronopotentiometry method at a constant current density of 10 mA cm−2 for 180 h in 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte it remains stable during 180 h operation. In addition, to test the viability of Mn–RuIr NCT for real time practical applications, the developed catalyst was tested in a single cell PEM water electrolyser; the Mn–RuIr NCT catalyst has shown improved electrochemical performance with on observed current density of 1 A cm−2 at 1.698 V than pure IrO2 (1.775 V).112 Uzgören I. N. et al. developed an IrO2–WO3 catalyst from scrap tungsten carbide–cobalt (WC–Co) die and studied its performance in acidic media. The developed IrO2–WO3 catalyst (75% IrO2–25% WO3) has shown 15.03% higher current density than the pure IrO2 catalyst. In addition, the overpotential value is decreased 1.2 times compared to the pure IrO2 and it showed a smaller Tafel slope of 104 mV dec−1.113
In addition to that, extensive research has been conducted on Ru-, Ir- and noble metal (NM)-free electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under acidic conditions. Fig. 13 presents the top ten most promising electrocatalysts in each category along with their respective overpotentials. Furthermore, a variety of electrocatalysts have been investigated in real-time PEM water electrolysers, and the results are summarized in Table 3. Among these electrocatalysts, the Ru-based electrocatalyst of Mn-doped RuO2 and Ir-based electrocatalyst of Li–IrSe2 have demonstrated lower overpotential of 158 mV and 180 mV respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm−2.114,115 Additionally, the NM-free electrocatalyst of MoSe2NS/MoO2ND/CNT-M exhibited an overpotential of 162 mV at a current density of 20 mA cm−2.116 However, it should be noted that these results have not been specifically studied in real-time PEM water electrolyser applications. Therefore, it is essential to assess their practical performance and durability in PEM water electrolysers for potential commercialization.

5. Capabilities of commercially available PEM electrolysers
Green hydrogen through water electrolysis powered by renewable electricity is a trending technology to meet the global net zero challenges (Table 4). Among many water electrolysis technologies, PEM water electrolysis is recognized as the most promising technology for the sustainable production of green hydrogen from water and intermittent renewable energy sources. Thus, today globally many public and private research organizations are actively working on the development of advanced PEM electrolysers and their scale-up technologies. However, for the dedicated production of hydrogen, PEM electrolysers are already commercially available in the market with a technology readiness level of TRL9. Today's PEM electrolyser stacks range between 30 and 220 cells with an active area of up to 1500 cm2. Most of the commercial PEM electrolysers are designed almost exclusively for operation under a pressure of 20–30 bars at temperatures of 30 to 80 °C, with an operating current density of roughly between 1.5 and 2.5 A cm−2.

6. Concluding remarks and future perspectives
Hydrogen has been recognized as a clean fuel with high propositional value that can be utilized for a broad range of applications in various industrial and transportation sectors. It plays an essential role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and meeting global net zero challenges. In this regard, globally, many countries have started concentrating on creating green hydrogen projects as part of a sustainable future. Green hydrogen is obtained through the water electrolysis process coupled with renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, geothermal, and hydroelectric power. Among the various water electrolysis technologies, PEM water electrolysis offers several advantages, including higher operating current densities, high energy efficiency, compact system design and rapid dynamic response when coupled with renewable energy sources. However, unfortunately, the production of green hydrogen through PEM water electrolysis is expensive compared to blue hydrogen (produced through conventional natural gas reforming and coal gasification). This is due to the high cost of renewable electricity, the use of expensive materials and low operation hours of PEM water electrolysis. The cost of green hydrogen production through the PEM water electrolysis process using different renewable energy sources is shown in Table 3. Therefore, considerable innovations and developments are needed to reduce the cost. The major components of PEM water electrolysis and their challenges (as shown in Fig. 14) are discussed below along with possible solutions.
 Fig. 14  Future research directions for the development of affordable PEM water electrolysers. 
• Bipolar plates (BPs) – BPs are one of the key components of the PEM water electrolysis that serve a crucial function in reactant water supply and elimination of evolved gases. Currently, titanium plates with protective layers of Pt and Au are commonly used in PEM water electrolysers, making them the highest cost contributors (53%) to the overall stack cost. Hence, it is essential to reduce the usage of expensive materials and protective coating layers.
• Gas diffusion layer – Gas diffusion layers act as a current collector and facilitate reactant transportation, electron transportation, and protection of catalyst layers against oxidation and abrasion caused by flows. Therefore, the development of cost-effective and highly durable GDLs with optimum porosity and pore size, thickness and surface characteristics remains a challenge that needs to be addressed.
• Membrane – The membrane is the heart of the electrolyser, and considerable improvements are needed in this area to boost hydrogen production, durability, and cost-effectiveness. For example, reducing the membrane thickness while increasing mechanical resistance can improve productivity and durability, thereby reducing electricity usage.
• Electrode materials – Electrode materials are another important component of PEM electrolysers, and considerable advancements are required in this portion due to the high cost of precious metals such as IrO2 and Pt, which are being major barriers to the scale-up and cost-effectiveness of PEM water electrolysers. Therefore, considerable efforts are required to replace or reduce the usage of these precious metals by employing earth-abundant and inexpensive alternatives. Additionally, obvious cost benefits can be achieved by reducing the precious metal loadings. For example, the current loadings are 3.0 mg Ir per cm2 and 1.0 mg Pt per cm2 and an expected reduction of 0.25 mg Ir per cm2 and 0.05 mg Pt per cm2 without any performance degradation would bring about notable cost benefits.
• Stackability – Obvious capital expenditure (CAPEX) cost reductions can be achieved by increasing the electrode active area. The present electrode active area is around 1500 cm2, but a suggested electrode active area of over 10000 cm2 can significantly lower costs. Additionally, cost reduction can be achieved by increasing the number of cells in the electrolyser stack, which can reduce the overall initial investment cost.
7. Conclusions
In this review, we provided a quick overview of the major water electrolysis systems and their techno-commercial possibilities, including the cost of hydrogen production. Furthermore, we focused primarily on recent developments in cell components for PEM water electrolysis, such as membranes, gas diffusion layers, bipolar plates, and electrocatalysts. Additionally, we discussed some of the most successful outcomes and identified research gaps in PEM water electrolysis for cost reduction, scale-up, and commercialization prospects. Finally, we presented our views, potential solutions, and suggestions for future research aimed at building efficient and inexpensive PEM electrolysers for green hydrogen production.
