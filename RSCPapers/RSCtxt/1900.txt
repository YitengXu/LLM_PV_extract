    , Accepted 14th October 2016First published on 14th October 2016AbstractWe report here the discovery of a unique room-temperature water-vapor annealing (WVA) method to fabricate high performance planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells (pero-SCs) based on CH3NH3PbI3. High crystallinity and void-free perovskite films were obtained by the WVA treatment at room temperature without thermal annealing (TA) and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the pero-SCs reached 16.4% with a high open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1 V. A mechanism is proposed that the water vapor molecules catalyzed the dissolution and re-crystallization of the perovskite at the grain edges and void area, resulting in void-free and large sized crystals in the perovskite films and the improved photovoltaic performance. This WVA approach provides a simple, high-efficiency and energy conservation processing method in the fabrication of planar perovskite solar cells towards commercialization.
Organic–inorganic hybrid metal halide perovskite solar cells (pero-SCs) are promising as a candidate to meet the future energy generation, due to the high power conversion efficiency (PCE) surpassing 20% with simple solution-based processing approaches on laboratory-type cells.1–10 Appropriate preparation approaches to form high-quality perovskite thin films are critical to the research and development in this area.11–18 High temperature thermal annealing (TA) is routinely conducted to form compact perovskite thin films, but it is inconvenient for massive production owing to energy consumption and the decomposition of perovskites at high temperature during the thermal annealing.19–23 Recently, the studies of You et al. showed that perovskite has a shorter nominal energy payback time (0.22 years) than other technologies.24 The energy payback time is defined as the time necessary for a photovoltaic device to generate equivalent energy that is consumed to produce it. In this context, the payback time can be further reduced in the future with more efficient processing technologies such as the room temperature processing method. Therefore, it is of great importance to develop a simple and reliable solution processing method to form void-free and highly crystalline perovskite films for efficient pero-SCs without the need for thermal annealing. Solvent annealing, as an alternative of thermal annealing, is used to realize uniform, ultra-smooth perovskite films at room temperature and different solvents such as chlorobenzene and DMF are being explored.25,26 Water is the most abundant, low-cost and real green solvent on the earth. Although moisture is known to affect the photovoltaic performance of the pero-SCs with positive influence15,27,28 as well as negative influence,29–33 there is no clear understanding of the role of water in affecting the formation of the perovskite crystalline films and the photovoltaic performance of the pero-SCs.
In this study, we report the discovery of a water-vapor annealing (WVA) method at room temperature for the formation of high crystallinity and void-free CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films. The WVA treatment is conducted at room temperature for an appropriate relative humidity (RH%) and duration time without the need of TA treatment. We demonstrate a mechanism that water vapor molecules improve the crystal growth process of perovskite films by dissolution and recrystallization. Planar heterojunction pero-SCs with the WVA treatment displayed a PCE of 16.4%, which is comparable to that of the most planar pero-SCs prepared by TA. The novel, simple, and energy conservation WVA treatment method should be extremely important for future large area fabrication of the pero-SCs.

Fig. 1a illustrates the preparation procedure of perovskite films in this study. First, the pristine perovskite films are prepared based on a one-step fast deposition–crystallization method34 in which nonpolar solvent chlorobenzene is dripped on the substrate during spin-coating. After the sample plates were transferred into a Petri dish with a diameter of 60 mm, certain volume of water is dripped into the center of the Petri dish and the sample plates are placed around the water drop. Then, the Petri dish was covered with a glass cover rapidly, and kept at room temperature (25 °C) for 60 min. It is worth noting that this WVA treatment is in all cases conducted at room temperature in the air, and no further thermal annealing treatment is needed afterwards. The RH% of the atmosphere in the Petri dish can be controlled by systematically varying the duration time and the volume of water. As presented in Fig. 1b, the RH% increases from 10% to 36% in the first 10 minutes and maintains 36–43% in 10 to 100 minutes. After 100 minutes, the RH% decreases slowly to 30%. The liquid water evaporates to form water vapor and the water vapor overflows inside the Petri dish; as a result, a simple dynamic near-equilibrium may exist in 10 to 100 minutes. The inset of Fig. 1b shows the RH% change with time when the volume of water is 5, 10, 15 and 20 μL respectively in the 60 minutes. The RH% was 33–36% (water volume of 5 μL), 33–42% (10 μL), 36–43% (15 μL), and 36–51% (20 μL), respectively. To optimize the WVA conditions, different duration times and RH% were employed for the WVA treatment of the perovskite films.

(b) RH% of the atmosphere in the Petri dishes with a volume of 15 μL water for 120 minutes. Inset: RH% of the atmosphere in the Petri dishes with different volumes of water for 60 minutes. (c) Normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of the perovskite films treated by air annealing (25 °C, RH% < 10%) for 60 minutes, TA at 100 °C for 10 minutes and WVA at 25 °C in the RH% = 36–43% for 60 minutes. (d) XRD patterns of the perovskite films treated by air annealing (25 °C, RH% < 10%) for 60 minutes, TA at 100 °C for 10 minutes and WVA at 25 °C in the RH% = 36–43% for 60 minutes. 
The light-absorption ability is commonly used to judge the crystallization of the perovskite phase during the preparation of perovskite films of pero-SCs. Fig. 1c shows the normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of the perovskite films prepared by one time spin-coating and with the treatments of air (ca. 25 °C, RH% < 10%) for 60 minutes, TA at 100 °C for 10 min and WVA (ca. 25 °C, RH% = ∼40%) for 60 minutes, respectively. The absorption intensity of the perovskite film by WVA treatment is higher than that by TA or air treatment, which indicates that the crystallization of perovskite films is optimal by WVA treatment. Fig. S1a and S1b in the ESI† show the normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of the perovskite films under different treatment conditions for 60 minutes and that with WVA treatment in the RH% = 36–43% for different duration times, respectively. The maximum absorption intensity was reached for the film treated by WVA in the RH% = 36–43% for 60 minutes. Further increase of the RH% or elongation of the annealing time of WVA processing did not cause a significant difference in the absorption spectra, indicating that the crystallization was completed in 60 minutes under the WVA treatment in the RH% = 36–43% at room temperature.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured to investigate the crystallinity of the perovskite films under different treatment conditions. Fig. 1d shows the XRD patterns of the perovskite films treated by air, TA and WVA, respectively. All of the perovskite films exhibit strong diffraction peaks at 14.24° and at 28.58° for the (110) and (220) planes of CH3NH3PbI3 respectively. With similar film thickness and under the same measurement conditions, the diffraction peak intensity of the perovskite films processed by WVA is higher than that of the perovskite films processed by air or TA treatment. This change is indicative of a higher degree of crystallinity in the film with WVA, which is highly desirable for pero-SC application.35 In addition, for the film treated by WVA, a peak at 12.80° related to the PbI2 (001) planes is also obviously observed, which is favorable for pero-SC via surface passivation.36 According to the diffraction peak intensity of the perovskite films, we optimize the volume of water and time in the WVA treatment. As shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI,† we found that the diffraction peak intensity is strong for the perovskite films treated by WVA in different RH% and with a time from 0 to 120 minutes, but the perovskite films treated by WVA in the RH% = 36–43% (Fig. S2a in the ESI†) and an annealing time of 60 minutes (Fig. S2b in the ESI†) displayed the strongest diffraction peak intensity at (110) and (220) planes. Therefore in the following, RH% = 36–43% and 60 minutes were used in the WVA treatment.
Morphology is also measured for characterizing the quality of perovskite films. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM) images of the perovskite films are presented in Fig. 2, and S3–S5 in the ESI.†Fig. 2a–f are SEM images of the perovskite films (ca. 300 nm thickness) prepared using the one-step fast deposition–crystallization method and treated by air, TA and WVA, respectively. All of the perovskite films exhibit a flat surface with fine crystallites. But different treatments make a lot of difference in the surface grain size of the perovskite. The average surface grain size of the perovskite was estimated to be approximately 106 nm (by air), 239 nm (by TA) and 351 nm (by WVA in RH% = 36–43%) according to the planimetric method involving the counts of the number of grains within a given area. The results demonstrate that crystallization processing of perovskite crystals can be promoted by TA and WVA treatments but the WVA is more efficient. In addition, some voids are often found inside the perovskite films (see Fig. 2a). It may occur when the perovskite species precipitate from the precursor solution and shrink during crystallization, leaving isolated voids behind. After TA or WVA treatment, most of the voids disappeared, and a dense, smooth perovskite film emerged in its place (especially in Fig. 2d for the WVA treated film), which is responsible for the visual evolution of the film from dull to shiny.
 Fig. 2  SEM images of the perovskite films treated by air (a), TA (f) and WVA in the RH% = 33–36% (water volume of 5 μL) (b), RH% = 33–42% (10 μL) (c), RH% = 36–43% (15 μL) (d), RH% = 36–51% (20 μL) (e) for 60 minutes, respectively. 

Fig. 2 and S3 in the ESI† show the SEM images of the perovskite films treated by WVA with different water volumes for 60 minutes and that in the RH% = 36–43% for different annealing times, respectively. Larger perovskite crystals with very less voids are observed in the perovskite films by WVA treatment in R H% = 36–43% for 60 minutes. The surface morphology of the perovskite films is also characterized by the AFM measurement, as shown in Fig. S4 and S5 in the ESI† respectively. The root mean square (RMS) roughness values were 3.27 nm, 3.80 nm, and 6.82 nm for the films treated by air, TA and WVA (treatment in RH% = 36–43% for 60 minutes) respectively. It could be found that the bigger crystalline size results in the increase of surface roughness. Nevertheless, all the RMS values are relatively low, and the films still retain a uniform, void-free surface, which is critical for efficient planar pero-SCs.
On the basis of detailed investigation of the growth of perovskite films, a mechanism for the crystal growth properties in perovskite films with the treatment of water vapor annealing is proposed in three steps and illustrated in Fig. 3a. As the films were placed in a semi-closed Petri dish, due to the hydrogen bonding effect between water molecules and methylammonium cations, the water molecules could be absorbed on the grain edges and the surface of the void area of the perovskite films, and thus could condense at these areas (state (1) in Fig. 3a). Under the appropriate water vapor pressure, the absorbed water molecules could weaken the hydrogen bonding between the methylammonium cations and the Pb–I cage,37 and may lead to some perovskite being decomposed into PbI2 and CH3NH3I at the grain edge and in the void area of the perovskite film (state (2) in Fig. 3a). Meanwhile, the restrained CH3NH3I reacts with nearby PbI2 to regenerate the perovskite phase again to make the perovskite crystals grow up (state (3) in Fig. 3a) under the appropriate water vapor pressure. Thus, the WVA treatment can be described as that the water vapor molecules catalyzed the crystal growth of perovskite films by dissolution and recrystallization of the perovskite at the grain edges and in the void area under the appropriate water vapor pressure, which results in void free and large sized crystalline perovskite films (Fig. 3b).
 Fig. 3  (a) Schematic diagram showing the mechanisms of the crystal growth processes in a perovskite film: (1) water molecules are absorbed on the perovskite surface, and the absorbed water molecules mediate a strong hydrogen bonding between the methylammonium cations and the Pb–I cage; (2) perovskite hydrolysis into PbI2 and CH3NH3I by water; (3) restrained CH3NH3I react with nearby PbI2 to form perovskite again after water evaporates. (b) Schematic diagram showing the higher degree of crystallinity and texture in the perovskite films by the WVA treatment. 
It is well-known that a high-temperature TA treatment is applied to drive CH3NH3I and PbI2 to form perovskite films. However, TA for extended periods led to degraded device performance owing to the defects generated by decomposition of perovskite into PbI2. Similar to TA treatment, the WVA treatment can lead to higher quality perovskite films under defined and mild conditions. We conjecture that the water molecules result in decomposition of the perovskite at grain edges into PbI2 and CH3NH3I, and accelerate the re-formation of the perovskite from PbI2 and CH3NH3I,15,38 so that the grain sizes grow up. Meanwhile, the decomposition of perovskite into PbI2 and CH3NH3I is being carried out in the presence of water. This reversible process reached dynamic quasi-equilibrium under certain conditions, which is evidenced by the existence of PbI2 and perovskite shown in the XRD patterns (Fig. 1d). The UV-vis absorption spectra, XRD patterns and SEM images show that the function of water in the WVA is practically equivalent to that of the thermal treatment in the formation of high crystallinity and void-free CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films.
In the following, the WVA treatment was applied in fabrication of planar p-i-n pero-SCs based on CH3NH3PbI3, and the photovoltaic performance is compared with that of the devices treated by TA. The cross-sectional SEM image (by WVA) is shown in Fig. 4a. Fig. 4b and c present the current density (J)–voltage (V) curves of the pero-SCs under AM 1.5G illumination, 100 mW cm−2, and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices processed by TA and WVA, respectively. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The results show an obvious increase in performance parameters (open circuit voltage Voc: from 0.87 V to 1.00 V; short circuit current Jsc: from 19.38 mA cm−2 to 20.91 mA cm−2) from TA to WVA treatment. A significant improvement in the overall power conversion efficiency (PCE), from 12.88% to 16.39%, is observed, which is clearly the result of the improved film morphology. The Jsc values are consistent with the integrated Jsc (19.09 vs. 19.95 mA cm−2) calculated from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra in Fig. 4c.

In order to understand this enhancement, we performed time-resolved photoluminescence (TR-PL) measurements. Fig. 4d shows the PL decay curves monitored at the wavelength of ∼765 nm, extracted from the perovskite films prepared on the glass substrates. The curves are fitted with a single exponential equation. We can clearly see that the lifetime value of 370.05 ns for perovskite films treated by WVA is longer than that for perovskite films treated by TA (241.82 ns). It has been reported that the slower decays can be correlated with longer diffusion lengths and less defects of the perovskite films, indirectly giving a measure of charge collection efficiency for a given film thickness; thus a larger fraction of the solar spectrum can be harvested.39 As a result, the perovskite film by WVA treatment leads to a longer carrier lifetime corresponding to a better PCE. The improved Voc should be ascribed to the higher crystallinity of the perovskite films25 treated by WVA mentioned above. As shown in Fig. 2 and 4d, the higher crystallinity led to less defects in the perovskite films and a lower charge recombination loss, which could result in the higher Voc.
To check the hysteresis of the devices, in this work, we also used forward and reverse voltage scan directions to measure J–V curves, and the results are displayed in Fig. 4b and Table 1. No obvious photocurrent hysteresis was observed in the J–V curves of the planar p-i-n pero-SCs with the treatment of TA and WVA.
Fig. S6 in the ESI† shows the long-term stability test of the pero-SCs treated by TA and WVA in the RH% = 36–43% for 60 minutes in a glovebox. The performances of the devices remain almost unchanged in 21 days. But the average degradation rate of the devices treated by TA is significantly faster than that of the devices treated by WVA after 21 days. The efficiencies remained at ca. 80% (devices treated by WVA) compared to ca. 30% (devices treated by TA) of their initial values after 41 days. Moreover, the stabilized power outputs under working conditions demonstrate the potential of WVA treatment for achieving higher performance of the pero-SCs.
In summary, a simple room-temperature WVA treatment approach is introduced to fabricate high crystallinity and void-free perovskite films without the need for TA treatment. Under the optimized conditions (RH% = 36–43%, 60 minutes), the pero-SCs demonstrated a high PCE of 16.4% without obvious photocurrent hysteresis, which is comparable to those of most thermally annealed perovskite devices. A mechanism is proposed that the water vapor molecules catalyzed the dissolution and re-crystallization of the perovskite at the grain edges and void area, resulting in void free and large sized crystals in the perovskite films and the improved photovoltaic performance. The room-temperature WVA approach is compatible with industrial large area thin-film processing technologies. This WVA approach provides a simple, high-efficiency and energy conservation processing method in the fabrication of planar perovskite solar cells towards commercialization.
Experimental section
Methylamine solution (40 wt% in ethanol), hydriodic acid (57 wt% in H2O) and lead(II) iodide (PbI2, 99.999%) were purchased from Alfa or Sigma-Aldrich. Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) was obtained from Solarmer Materials Inc. Methylammonium iodide (MAI) was synthesized according to the literature by stoichiometrically reacting methylamine with hydriodic acid.40 The perovskite precursor was prepared by mixing MAI and PbI2 in a molar ratio of 1:1 in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%, Alfa), and the final concentration of the perovskite was controlled to approximately 40 wt%. The solution was stirred overnight at room temperature and filtered with 0.45 μm PVDF filters before spin-coating. The synthesis and characterization of PDINO were reported elsewhere.41
First, the patterned ITO substrates were sequentially ultrasonically cleaned with detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol. On the cleaned ITO substrate, the PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution filtered through 0.45 μm PVDF filters was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s and then dried at room-temperature in air. The as-prepared perovskite precursor solution was spin coated onto the ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate at a speed of 5000 rpm for 30 s. During the last 4.5 s of the spinning process, chlorobenzene was quickly added to induce fast crystallization. Then the perovskite film was treated by air, TA or WVA methods under the following treatment conditions: (1) air treatment. The sample plates of the spin-coated perovskite films were placed at room temperature in air (25 °C, RH% < 10%). (2) TA treatment. As a control, the TA process was conducted by putting the sample plates on a hot plate maintained at 100 °C for 10 minutes in air (RH% < 10%). (3) WVA treatment. The sample plates of the spin-coated perovskite films were put in Petri dishes (with a cover but not sealed) with vapors of water with different volumes and different duration times. The treatment was performed at room temperature in air (25 °C, RH% < 10%). After the WVA or TA treatments, the PCBM (20 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) and PDINO (1 mg mL−1 in methanol) were then sequentially deposited by spin coating at 1500 rpm for 30 s and 3000 rpm for 30 s, respectively. Finally, a 100 nm Al electrode was deposited on the PDINO layer under high vacuum by thermal evaporation.
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured on a computer – controlled Keithley 2450 Source – Measure Unit. An Oriel Sol3A Class AAA Solar Simulator (model, Newport 94023A) with a 450 W xenon lamp and an air mass (AM) 1.5 filter was used as the light source. The input bias voltage was scanned in forward (−1.5 V to 1.5 V, FS) and reverse directions (1.5 V to −1.5 V, RS) in 0.01 V steps with a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1. The measurement was through a shadow mask with an active area of 0.05 cm2 under illumination at ca. 25.0 °C. The light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 by using a Newport Oriel 91150V reference cell. The EQE spectra were recorded with an Enli Technology (Taiwan) EQE measurement system (QE-R), and the light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell. The thickness of the interlayer was determined by using a Profilometer (Ambios Tech. XP-2). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed in order to investigate the morphology of the perovskite films prepared on top of PEDOT:PSS. Top-view and cross-sectional images were characterized by using a HITACHI s-4800 (Hitachi Limited, Japan) using an InLens detector operating at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained by utilizing a SPA-400 SPM (Seiko Instrument, Inc.). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a D/MAX-2000 X-ray diffractometer with monochromated Cu Kα irradiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The time-resolved PL measurements at the peak emission of ∼765 nm were recorded by using a lifetime and steady state spectrometer (FLS980, Edinburgh Instruments Ltd.) with a 470 nm laser.

 	Fig. 1  (a) Schematic diagram of the preparation procedure of perovskite films with water vapor annealing at room temperature. (b) RH% of the atmosphere in the Petri dishes with a volume of 15 μL water for 120 minutes. Inset: RH% of the atmosphere in the Petri dishes with different volumes of water for 60 minutes. (c) Normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of the perovskite films treated by air annealing (25 °C, RH% < 10%) for 60 minutes, TA at 100 °C for 10 minutes and WVA at 25 °C in the RH% = 36–43% for 60 minutes. (d) XRD patterns of the perovskite films treated by air annealing (25 °C, RH% < 10%) for 60 minutes, TA at 100 °C for 10 minutes and WVA at 25 °C in the RH% = 36–43% for 60 minutes.	 

 	Fig. 2  SEM images of the perovskite films treated by air (a), TA (f) and WVA in the RH% = 33–36% (water volume of 5 μL) (b), RH% = 33–42% (10 μL) (c), RH% = 36–43% (15 μL) (d), RH% = 36–51% (20 μL) (e) for 60 minutes, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Schematic diagram showing the mechanisms of the crystal growth processes in a perovskite film: (1) water molecules are absorbed on the perovskite surface, and the absorbed water molecules mediate a strong hydrogen bonding between the methylammonium cations and the Pb–I cage; (2) perovskite hydrolysis into PbI2 and CH3NH3I by water; (3) restrained CH3NH3I react with nearby PbI2 to form perovskite again after water evaporates. (b) Schematic diagram showing the higher degree of crystallinity and texture in the perovskite films by the WVA treatment.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Cross-sectional SEM image (by WVA in the RH% = 36–43%) of the pero-SCs. (b) FS/RS J–V curves under AM 1.5G illumination, 100 mW cm−2. (c) EQE spectra of the pero-SCs treated by TA and WVA in RH% = 36–43% for 60 minutes, respectively and (d) time-resolved photoluminescence decay plots of the CH3NH3PbI3 films treated by TA and WVA in RH% = 36–43% for 60 minutes (inset: summary of the parameters from fits to the TR-PL measurement. The fitting functions of a single exponential equation).
