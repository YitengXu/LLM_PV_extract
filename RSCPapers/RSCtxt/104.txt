    , Accepted 19th July 2017First published on 19th July 2017AbstractNanoscale core–shell CoMoO4@Co3O4 composite materials are fabricated by a multi-step hydrothermal process on the surface and side wall of an ordered macro-porous electrode plate (OMEP) as the active electrode in a high power density storage device. The morphology, formation mechanism of the CoMoO4@Co3O4 nanostructure, and capacitor performance are systematically studied. The CoMoO4@Co3O4/OMEP electrode has a capacity of 7.13 F cm−2 (1168.0 F g−1) at a constant current density of 0.6 A g−1 and a retention ratio of 81.4% after 5000 cycles. The large specific capacitance and excellent rate capability can be attributed to the unique 3D ordered porous architecture which facilitates electron and ion transport, enlarges the liquid–solid interfacial area, prevents agglomeration of nanomaterials, and boosts the utilization efficiency of the active materials. Reconstruction on the surface of the porous structured substrate enhances the power density and cycling performance at large current densities. Using the CoMoO4@Co3O4/OMEP electrode as the positive electrode and active carbon/nickel foam (AC/NF) as the negative electrode, the electrochemical electrode packaged in a CR2025 battery cell as a miniature hybrid device exhibits stable power characteristics (10000 cycles with 91.7% retention at a current of 0.1 A). The device produces large instantaneous power that charging it for 10 s and using three devices in series can power four parallel LED arrays at a current of 0.152 A.
1. Introduction
Growing fossil fuel consumption and related environmental concerns have sparked intensive research on sustainable energy production and conversion systems with low cost, high efficiency, and environmental benignity with low CO2 emission.1 Supercapacitors, as one of the most important energy storage devices, are viable energy storage devices for high power supplies as well as electric and hybrid vehicles due to the high power density, fast charging–discharging rates, and long cycle life.2 Supercapacitors also bridge the power/energy gap between solar cells/batteries/fuel cells and conventional electrostatic capacitors. According to the charge storage mechanisms, supercapacitors can be classified as electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors (PCs).3 In particular, PCs based on the fast reversible faradic redox reactions as well as ion adsorption and desorption like EDLCs on the electrode surface usually provide larger specific capacitance than supercapacitors composed of carbonaceous materials based on electric double-layer charge storage.4–6 Therefore, current research has focused on PCs and the specific capacitance of some transition metal oxides, hydroxide-based pseudocapacitive materials or combinations of them such as MnO2,7 V2O5,8 Fe2O3,9 Co3O4,10 CoO10 and NiO11 because of the relative low cost, manufacturability, and flexibility.
Among the various metal oxides, Co3O4 has attracted much interest because of its high theoretical specific capacitance, good redox performance, easily controllable size or shape, and tunable structural identities.12–14 Rakhi15 prepared mesoporous cobalt oxide nanosheets electrode arrays on flexible carbon paper substrates using an economical and scalable two-step process and the Co3O4 nanosheets delivered a high specific capacitance of 905.0 F g−1 even at a current density of 1 A g−1. However, due to the poor electrical conductivity and volume changes during cycling, the Co3O4 electrode usually suffers from poor rate capability and rapid capacity fading, resulting in unsatisfactory cycling performance. Furthermore, the spontaneous aggregation of Co3O4 materials is effectively unsolved,16,17 which prevents their further application such as supercapacitors,18 heterogeneous catalysts,19 electrochemical sensors,19 and lithium storage.20 Hence, the performance must be improved by developing functional nanocomposite materials with synergistic effects and much effort has been devoted to combining the unique properties of individual constituents to improve the electrochemical performance,12,21–23 for instance, composite structures like Co3O4@NiMoO4,3 NiCo2O4@NiMoO4,24 Ni(OH)2@CoMoO4,25 NiCo2S4@Co(OH)226 and NiCo2O@MnMoO4.27 Those three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical composites exhibit excellent structural advantages such as the large surface area, strong permeability, and ample surface active sites. Using a reflux technique, Mai et al.22 synthesized 3D hierarchical MnMoO4/CoMoO4 heterostructured nanowires with enhanced supercapacitor performance and larger specific capacitance than the single components of either MnMoO4 or CoMoO4.22 Huang et al.24 fabricated hierarchical core–shell NiCo2O4@NiMoO4 nanowires on carbon cloth (CC@NiCo2O4@NiMoO4) by a two-step hydrothermal technique for flexible binder-free electrodes with a larger areal capacitance of 2.917 F cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2 and 90.6% retention for 2000 cycles at a large current density of 20 mA cm−2.
Herein, we describe a two-step hydrothermal strategy to prepare 3D hierarchical CoMoO4@Co3O4 composite films on a 3D ordered macro-porous electrode plate (OMEP) as a high-performance multidimensional faradaic electrode. The advantage of a porous structure is summarized for battery performance,28 but few similar research studies exist on ordered porous materials like OMEPs in the field of supercapacitors. OMEPs with a typical pore size of 5 μm and channel depth of 270 μm can be produced by standard silicon and nanoscale technology.29 The CoMoO4 nanoflakes are chosen for pseudocapacitive and electrocatalytic reasons arising from the large cell parameters (a = 10.21 A, b = 9.268 A, c = 7.022 A) with stable electrochemical properties.30 The inner wall of the OMEP provides the space needed for the nickel current collector layer and CoMoO4@Co3O4 composite active materials and so the footprint of the electrode can be reduced while maintaining the advantage of a large surface area as shown in Fig. 1. CoMoO4 is first deposited onto the radically ordered OMEP to form the CoMoO4/OMEP hierarchical 3D nanostructure by hydrothermal self-assembly and then a nanocomposite layer of the Co3O4 nanostructure is prepared on the surface of CoMoO4/OMEP to fabricate the multi-dimensional electrode. The multi-dimensional hybrid nanostructure boasting a large surface area and short diffusion path for electrons and ions reduces agglomeration of materials.

2. Experimental details
2.1 Materials
The chemical reagents such as nickel chloride {NiCl2·6H2O}, sodium hypophosphite monohydrate {NaH2PO2·H2O}, ammonium chloride {NH4Cl}, ammonium {NH3·H2O}, chloride hexahydrate {CoCl2·6H2O}, nickel acetate tetrahydrate {C4H6O4Ni·4H2O} and ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate {(NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O} were of analytical reagent grade and used as received without further purification. The aqueous solutions were prepared with 18 MΩ deionized water and all the experiments were carried out at room temperature.
2.2 Fabrication of low-resistance ordered macro-porous electrode plate
The liquid flow plating method from Wang et al.31,32 was used to chemical deposition a nickel layer on both the outer surface and inner side wall of the silicon macrochannel plate33 (Si-MCP, as illustrated in Fig. 2(a)) to fabricated the ordered macro-porous electrode plate (OMEP). Fig. S1† shows the schematic diagram of the device and working principle for liquid flow deposition of a nickel layer on the surface and side wall of Si-MCP.32 Under the action of gravity and a water pump, the deposition fluid flows continuously through the surface and interior of the Si-MCP and the OMEP with a dense and uniform nickel layer was obtained. As shown in Fig. S2(a),† in nickel plating carried out by a conventional method, the amount of the nickel inside the Si-MCP is very limited, whereas, from Fig. S2(b),† it is seen that in the conducive layer fabricated through the liquid flow deposition method, the nickel on the channel of the OMEP is very dense which reduces the internal resistance and improves the life and performance of the device significantly. In order to improve the surface area and conductivity of the OMEP, porous nano-Ni shown in Fig. 2(b)–(d) was created by the electrochemical nickel plating method performed in a standard two electrode glass cell at 23 ± 1 °C in an electrolyte consisting of 2 M NH4Cl and 0.1 M NiCl2 at a pH of 3.5 with the clean OMEP as the working electrode and Pt foil as the counter electrode. The distance between the two electrodes was 1 cm and electrodeposition was carried out at a constant current of 0.25 A cm−2 for 90 s.

2.3 Synthesis of the hierarchical multidimensional CoMoO4@Co3O4/OMEP composite
CoMoO4 was prepared hydrothermally. The macroporous electrically conductive network (OMEP) was cut into small thin foils with an area of 0.8 × 0.9 cm2, put into a buffer solution of Triton X-100 for at least 2 minutes to increase the hydrophilicity, and placed standing against the wall of a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The reaction solution was obtained by mixing 2 mmol CoCl2·6H2O, 2 mmol (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, 5 mmol NH4F, and 5 mmol of urea in 100 mL of distilled water under magnetic stirring and transferred to the Teflon-lined autoclave. The reaction proceeded for 2.5 h at a temperature of 120 °C, resulting in the formation of a violet precipitate on the surface of the OMEP. The coated OMEP was cleaned by deionized water and ethanol to remove the impurities in the surface, and then dried in an oven at 80 °C for 12 h. Finally, the sample was annealed in a pure Ar atmosphere at 300 °C for 2 h to obtain CoMoO4/OMEP.
Co3O4 was prepared by a hydrothermal method. The cleaned CoMoO4/OMEP was placed standing against the wall of a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The reaction solution was obtained by mixing 1 mmol CoCl2·6H2O, 10 mmol NH4F, and 10 mmol urea in 100 mL of distilled water under magnetic stirring and transferred into the Teflon-lined autoclave liner. After reacting for 1.5 h at 140 °C, the OMEP with the as-grown hydrate precursors was dried at 80 °C for 2 h and annealed at 300 °C for 2 h in Ar to obtain the CoMoO4@Co3O4/OMEP. In order to study the performance of the device with a planar structure, CoMoO4@Co3O4 was prepared on a Ni-covered silicon wafer for comparison. The fabrication steps and size of CoMoO4@Co3O4/Ni/Si was the same as those of CoMoO4@Co3O4/OMEP.
2.4 Characterization and fabrication of the asymmetrical device
The morphology and microstructure of the OMEP, Co3O4, CoMoO4 and CoMoO4@Co3O4 thin films were examined by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JEOL JSM-7001F, Japan) and the crystal structure was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku, RINT2000, Japan). The Raman scattering spectra were recorded from 200 to 2000 cm−1 on an Olympus BX41 Raman Microprobe using a 524.5 nm argon ion laser. The elemental composition was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD). The TEM image, SAED patterns, lattice structure and EDS maps were obtained by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (STEM, Jeol JEM-2100F).
The electrochemical measurements were performed on a three-electrode electrochemical working station (Shanghai Chenhua CHI660D) with the saturated calomel electrode and platinum gauze electrode serving as the reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. The measurements were conducted at room temperature in a 2 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. In order to determine the electrochemical properties and specific capacity of the electrode samples, CV scans were acquired from 0 to 0.45 V (vs. SCE) from each sample at different scanning rates. Chronopotentiometry tests were conducted in the potential range between 0 and 0.45 V at different constant current densities. The measurements of asymmetric pseudocapacitance (ASC) were carried out to estimate the practical value of the composite materials according to the CV scans from 0 to 1.5 V, charging–discharging tests from 0 to 1.5 V, as well as application tests. Impedance spectra were acquired from CoMoO4@Co3O4/OMEP and ASC before and after the cycling test from 0.01 to 10000 Hz to investigate the reaction mechanism of the electrode and device.
The asymmetrical device was assembled using the CoMoO4@Co3O4/OMEP and active carbon/Ni-foam electrodes separated by a polyethylene (PE) membrane. The PE membrane was pretreated and dipped in KOH for 10 min and assembled with the electrodes in a CR2032 battery case with the quasi solid electrolyte. The specific capacitance (Cs), areal capacitance (Ca), specific capacitance from CV curves (Ccv), energy density (E), and power density (P) were calculated from the following equations:34,35 (1) (2) (3) (4)and (5)Where I (A) is the current during the discharge process, Δt (s) is the discharge time, m (g) is the mass of the electroactive materials, ΔV (V) is the applied potential window, S (cm2) is the area of the working electrode,  is the covered area of CV, and s (mV s−1) is the scanning rate of CV.
3. Results and discussion
The rough morphology and excellent electrical conductivity of the OMEP can benefit the growth of nanomaterial transport of electrolyte ions and electrons and therefore two-step deposition of nano-scale Ni was conducted on the surface and sidewall of Si-MCP (Fig. 2(a)) as a key step.36 After fabrication of the OMEP, a two-step hydrothermal method is employed to synthesize the active materials at a high temperature and pressure, so that the solution can easily penetrate the nanoscale electrode substrate and the hierarchical CoMoO4@Co3O4 composite structure is prepared uniformly on the surface and sidewall of the 3D OMEP. The thin Co3O4, CoMoO4, and CoMoO4@Co3O4 films are deposited on the nickel-coated OMEP for comparison as shown in Fig. S3† and the electrochemical properties and effects of the solvents on the morphology of those samples are determined from an active area of 0.6 cm2. The CoMoO4@Co3O4 composite is prepared on a 0.6 cm2 nickel covered silicon wafer by the same fabrication process and tested under the same conditions for comparison. Moreover, the asymmetric pseudocapacitor (ASC) is prepared to estimate the practical value of the composite materials.
3.1 Materials characterization

Fig. 2(a) depicts the SEM images of the Si-MCP providing a general view of the morphology of the sample showing a uniform structure. As shown in Fig. 2(b) and (c), OMEP retains not only the original 3D morphology, but also the nickel current collector with good uniformity and Fig. 2(d) reveals the uniform nickel layer on the side wall and interior of the OMEP. The structure of the nanoscale composite films is determined by X-ray diffraction as shown in Fig. 3(a). The XRD pattern of the backbone material OMEP without the deposited nanostructure is displayed and compared to that of Co3O4/OMEP and CoMoO4@Co3O4/OMEP, it shows a stronger diffraction peaks of Ni (Ni: JCPDS card no. 01-089-7128) and Si, suggesting successful deposition of active materials on the substrate. The hierarchical CoMoO4 nanostructure (CoMoO4: JCPDS card no. 00-021-0868) and Co3O4 (Co3O4: JCPDS card no. 74-2120) in CoMoO4@Co3O4/OMEP are shown in Fig. 3(a).35Fig. 3(b) shows the Raman scattering spectrum of the CoMoO4@Co3O4/OMEP composite. Fig. 3(b) depicts the Raman spectra of the CoMoO4 particles showing peaks at 335, 817, 880, and 936 cm−1 and other peaks at 478 and 521 cm−1 arising from the Co3O4 crystalline phase.37,38 The valence states of oxygen, molybdenum and cobalt in CoMoO4@Co3O4/OMEP are determined by XPS. The survey spectrum in Fig. 3(c) shows the presence of C, O, Ni, Co, Mo and Si being consistent with XRD [Fig. 3(a)] and EDS [Fig. S4†]. As shown in Fig. 3(d), the binding energies of the Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 photoelectrons are 779.8, 780.3, and 781.1 eV corresponding to Co3O4, CoOOH and CoMoO4, respectively. The Mo 3d core-level spin–orbit doublets (at 232 and 235 eV) in Fig. 3(e) are in accordance with the reported value of a splitting width of 3.0 eV.39,40 The Mo6+ peak is attributed to surface Mo species that have been oxidized upon air exposure. The O 1s spectrum shows five oxygen peaks, O1 (529.7 eV), O2 (530.0 eV), O3 (530.7 eV), O4 (531.9 eV), and O5 (532.7) ascribed to Co–OH, Co–O, Mo–O, Si–O and physisorbed/chemisorbed oxygen at/near the surface,41,42 respectively, being consistent with the elemental valence states.

The morphology of the CoMoO4 nanoflakes, Co3O4 nanosheets and CoMoO4@Co3O4 nanocomposite on the OMEP is shown in Fig. 4(a)–(k). The CoMoO4 nanoflakes on the Ni support layer are interconnected with each other forming a nanoscale bifunctional layer with an open network as shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b). As a result, most of the nanoflakes are readily accessible by the electrolyte when used as the faradaic electrode as well as physical support for the Co3O4 nanosheets. By controlling the hydrothermal reaction conditions, ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets are obtained on the surface and sidewall of the OMEP as well as CoMoO4 nanoflakes. As shown in Fig. 4(c) and (d), the Co3O4 nanosheets have an ultrathin structure with a typical thickness of 5 nm and so they can easily spread to the surface of other materials. Fig. 4(e) shows that the CoMoO4@Co3O4 on the surface of the OMEP increases the area and amount of active materials per unit area. Fig. 4(f) and (g) display the enlarged SEM image of a local area in Fig. 4(e) revealing ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets on the surface and in the gap among the CoMoO4 nanoflakes, which promote transport of electrons and space utilization. Owing to the ordered porous structure of the OMEP, the area of the inner wall is relatively large and Fig. 4(i) and (j) show that the CoMoO4 nanoflakes and Co3O4 nanosheets have a morphology similar to that on the surface. The self-supporting multidimensional structure has higher space utilization than conductive layers like copper and aluminum foils and provides 3D paths for ions. Fig. 4(k) and (l) show that the nanostructured CoMoO4@Co3O4 has a reticulate transfixion structure that promotes the interaction between electrons from the conduction layer and ions adsorbed on the surface of the nanomaterials from the electrolyte. The CoMoO4@Co3O4 nanostructure is uniformly deposited on the sidewall of the macroporous, while maintaining the ion transport space in the channel to improve space utilization of the substrate electrode of the OMEP.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is carried out to investigate the structure of the CoMoO4, Co3O4, and CoMoO4@Co3O4. Fig. 5(a) depicts the typical TEM image of lamellar CoMoO4 after ultrasonic treatment in ethanol. The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of the representative CoMoO4 nanoflakes are shown in the inset of Fig. 5(a). Fig. 5(b) presents the typical TEM image and the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of the representative Co3O4 nanosheets.43 After the ultrasonic treatment in ethanol, the Co3O4 nanosheets spread out and their lamellar structure and lattice characteristics can be clearly observed. CoMoO4 and Co3O4 have the same morphology consistent with that conveyed by SEM. The representative TEM and HR-TEM images of the precursor of CoMoO4@Co3O4 are displayed in Fig. 5(c)–(e) and the inset. The precursor CoMoO4 is coated with Co3O4 to form a stacked core–shell heterostructure (Fig. 5(c)) and HR-TEM reveals that lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.35 nm that matches the (002) plane of the monoclinic CoMoO4 phase44 as well as lattice fringes with a lattice spacing of 0.24 nm corresponding to the (311) plane of Co3O4.14 The elemental composition of CoMoO4@Co3O4 is determined by EDS and the elemental maps (Fig. 5(f)–(i)) indicate uniform distributions of cobalt, oxygen, and molybdenum on the particles.

3.2 Electrochemical characterization
By altering the hydrothermal synthesis formula and process while keeping the other parameters the same, the surface coverage, amount of coated active materials, and electrical characteristics of the samples are evaluated. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronopotentiometry are conducted to determine the specific capacitance and electrochemical properties of the electrodes. Fig. 6(a) discloses that the capacitance of the CoMoO4@Co3O4 fabricated on the nickel covered silicon is negligible, whereas CoMoO4@Co3O4/OMEP shows considerably larger capacitance because of the larger enclosed area in the CV curve [Fig. 6(a), 20 mV s−1] and longer discharge time [Fig. 6(b), 8 mA cm−2 charging–discharging current] than the OMEP, Co3O4, or CoMoO4 fabricated on the OMEP and CoMoO4@Co3O4 on nickel. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 6(a), Co3O4/OMEP shows a similar enclosed area as CoMoO4/OMEP but smaller area than CoMoO4@Co3O4/OMEP because CoMoO4@Co3O4/OMEP has more abundant nanomaterials and the composite structure improves the performance of the electrode.
 Fig. 6  (a) Cyclic voltammetry curves at the scanning rate of 20 mV S−1 and (b) 8 mA cm−2 charge–discharge curves of the newly fabricated OMEP, CoMoO4@Co3O4/OMEP, CoMoO4/OMEP, Co3O4/OMEP and CoMoO4@Co3O4/Ni/Si electrode; (c) CV curves of CoMoO4@Co3O4/OMEP at different scanning rates and (d) charging–discharging curves of CoMoO4@Co3O4/OMEP at different current densities after activation. 
Consistent with CV, at the current density of 8 mA cm−2, the discharge time of the OMEP (22.82 s) is negligible and meanwhile, Co3O4/OMEP and CoMoO4/OMEP show a short discharge time of 121 s and 108 s and a coulombic efficiency (CE) of 58.36% and 85.13%, respectively. As expected, CoMoO4@Co3O4/OMEP shows a longer discharge time of 343 s and a CE of 69.3% because the nanostructured CoMoO4 has an excellent ion transport capacity that promotes the activity of Co3O4 that adheres well onto the CoMoO4 surface.
The CV curves obtained at various scanning rates from CoMoO4@Co3O4/OMEP are displayed in Fig. 6(c) and those of Co3O4/OMEP and CoMoO4/OMEP are presented in Fig. S5(a) and (c)† for comparison. As the scanning rate is increased from 10 to 150 mV s−1, the peak current increase gradually. The oxidation and reduction peaks are apparent and peak shape is similar, especially at scanning rates below 80 mV s−1. However, the peak potential shifts to the anodic and cathodic directions, respectively, because of more substantial polarization at larger scanning rates. As the scanning rate is increased, the peak currents are proportional to the square root of the scanning rates, implying that the electrodes have good electrochemical performance. In the CV curve, there is a small angle along the horizontal axis indicating that the electrodes have smaller impedance. The combination of the probable chemical reactions from Co3O4 and CoMoO4 is listed as follows:6,45,46 Co3O4 + OH− + H2O ↔ 3CoOOH + e−(6) CoOOH + OH− ↔ CoO2 + H2O + e−(7) 3[Co(OH)3]− ↔ Co3O4 + 4H2O + OH− + 2e−(8)
The two pairs of visible redox peaks in the CV curves confirm reactions (6)–(8), suggesting that instead of a pure electrical double-layer capacitance, the measured faradaic electrochemical electrode is dominated by a redox mechanism. It should be emphasized that the anodic peak potential, CV change, and cathodic peak potential shift in the anodic and cathodic directions with increasing sweeping rates decrease the capacitance. At a large scanning rate, unlike the CV from CoMoO4@Co3O4/OMEP, the CV from Co3O4/OMEP and CoMoO4/OMEP shows a faster current response indicating that CoMoO4@Co3O4/OMEP has more materials participate in the reaction and part of materials do not respond adequately at high scanning rates.
To evaluate the potential application of the 3D OMEP comprising the nanostructured electrode (CoMoO4@Co3O4/OMEP), the chronopotentiometry characteristics are evaluated at current densities from 4 to 60 mA cm−2. According to the chronopotentiometric results in Fig. 6(d), the total active mass loading of 6.1 mg cm−2 and formula (1) and (2), the area (specific) capacitance values are calculated to be 7.13, 6.25, 5.88, 5.75, and 5.21 F cm−2 (1168.0, 1024.6, 914.75 and 854.1 F g−1) for discharge current densities of 4, 8, 15, 30 and 60 mA cm−2, respectively. The capacitances obtained from CoMoO4@Co3O4/OMEP are much larger than those from the Co3O4@NiCo2O4 core–shell structure (2.94 F cm−2 at a discharge current density of 3 mA cm−2) described by Xu et al.45 The CoMoO4@NiMoO4 core–shell nanosheet arrays on nickel foam (2.22 F g−1 and 1106.9 F g−1 at a discharge current of 60 mA cm−2) reported by Zhang et al.44 and the specific capacitance is comparable to those obtained from the forest-like Co3O4@CoMoO4 core–shell electrode (1200 F g−1 at a discharge current of 10 A g−1) prepared by Wang et al.35 and NiCo2O4@MnMoO4 electrodes (1252.6 F g−1 at 20 mA cm−2) by Cui et al.27 The chronopotentiometry curves of CoMoO4/OMEP and Co3O4/OMEP are shown in Fig. S5(b) and (d).† The comparison of the interfacial capacitances calculated with and formula (2) and (3) from CV and chronopotentiometry curves of the CoMoO4/OMEP, Co3O4/OMEP electrodes at different scanning rates and current density is presented in Fig. S6(a) and (b)† respectively. All the tests show that the OMEP and CoMoO4@Co3O4 composite improves the device performance.
Long-time performance tests are carried out to evaluate the stability of the samples and the results are shown in Fig. 7(a). The CoMoO4@Co3O4/Ni/Si shows a 56.6% sharp capacitance drop probably due to the smooth structure of nickel deposited on the 2D silicon wafer against the firm bonding of CoMoO4@Co3O4 during the Faraday reaction. The capacitances of CoMoO4/OMEP and Co3O4/OMEP are stable with a capacitance retention of 87.7% and 99.6% after 5000 cycles at a current density of 100 mA cm−2, respectively. The capacity stability observed from the two samples may arise from single nanoparticles with less active sites on the surface that can be closely connected with the substrate and undergo continuous electrochemical reactions. While the capacitance of CoMoO4@Co3O4/OMEP shows 81.4% retention because of the largest amount of composite active materials in the OMEP pores and close integration with OMEP, during the reaction, the composite may undergo some transformation and reconstruction reducing the capacity. The reconstruction may originate from the reaction of CoMoO4 and Co3O4 under alkaline conditions and Co2+ ions in the solution are re-grown on the surface of the CoMoO4 nanoflakes electrochemically. The surface structure of CoMoO4@Co3O4/OMEP after 5000 cycles is shown in Fig. 7(c) and (d). At the same time, the SEM in Fig. 7 and S3(c)† show that the structure has not been damaged after a series of tests in KOH, because the nickel layer deposited on Si-MCP by the liquid flow plating method is thick enough to prevent the silicon substrate from corrosion.

EIS is performed on the CoMoO4@Co3O4/OMEP electrodes with an AC perturbation of 5 mV from 0.01 Hz to 100000 Hz. Fig. 7(b) shows the EIS data obtained at three different stages, the newly fabricated electrode, after activation, and after 5000 cycles. The equivalent circuit and results in the inset are fitted to the impedance spectra.47 The electrode internal resistance R1 is less than 1 Ω indicating a highly conductive nature. The faradaic charge transfer resistance (R2) corresponding to the semicircle in the high frequency range is associated with the surface properties of the electrode. In the equivalent circuit, we introduce the constant phase element (CPE) component.47 CPE1 and CPE2 represent the double-layer and faradaic capacitance that vary with frequencies. This pure capacitance behavior can be explained by the distribution effects48 and porosity49 of the samples. On account of the influence of the 3D structure of the OMEP on mass transport, CPE3 represents the Warburg impedance.50

Table 1 shows that the newly fabricated sample has an R2 value of 3.450 Ω. After the activation process, it is 1.024 Ω and after 5000 cycles, it is 4.930 Ω, which is consistent with the double-layer capacitance CPE1−n of CoMoO4@Co3O4/OMEP (0.698 Ω) after activation (0.525 Ω) and after 5000 cycles (0.545 Ω). CoMoO4@Co3O4/OMEP after activation yields a larger double layer capacitance which may be due to the fact that the active materials on the sample have more contact with the electrolyte. Most of the nanostructure recombines or adsorb/desorb ions and after cycling, some of the active materials drop from the substrate. The capacitance is a pseudo one and so the parameters R3 and CPE2−n are the key performance indicators. The R3 values before, after activation, and after cycling are 30.2 Ω, 0.82 Ω and 9.802 Ω, respectively, because the active materials react more with the electrolyte. Most of the nanostructure is activated and more active substances take part in the reaction. Comparison of CPE2−n shows that the newly made sample has a CPE2−n of 0.652 that is smaller than that after activation of 1.016 and after cycling of 4.811.51 Furthermore, the slope of the impedance plots (CPE3−n) is 0.831 after activation and 0.809 after cycling compared to 0.649 of the newly fabricated sample at low frequencies. This indicates that the special complex microstructure with flakes and sheets enables faster ion diffusion through the channels of the OMEP but after 5000 cycles, some of the structure collapses.

3.3 Electrochemical properties of the CoMoO4@Co3O4 hybrid device
To further evaluate the commercial potential of CoMoO4@Co3O4, a hybrid device composed of the CoMoO4@Co3O4/OMEP electrode as the anode, activated carbon and conductive carbon black on nickel foam as the cathode in a quasi-solid electrolyte together with one piece of PE membrane as the separator is prepared. They are packaged by a CR2025 standard battery cell.36 The oxidation and reduction peaks can be observed from Fig. 8(a) and the peak current becomes larger as the scanning rate is increased from 10 to 400 mV s−1. However, there is no obvious distortion in the CV curve even at a scanning rate of 400 mV s−1, corroborating the large comparative area and rapid ion diffusion capability of the composite nanostructures on the OMEP resulting in the fast charging–discharging properties of the device.52 Fig. S7(a)† shows that the potential window of the CoMoO4@Co3O4/OMEP electrode is 0 to 0.45 V. On the other hand, there is a rectangular CV curve from −1.1 to 0 V for the AC electrode, indicative of the EDLC behavior. Therefore, the total cell voltage of the ASC device can be increased up to 1.5 V, which is the sum of the potential range for the AC and CoMoO4@Co3O4/OMEP electrodes.44

The charging–discharging test is performed at various current densities. As shown in Fig. 8(b), the shape of the charging–discharging curves at different current densities resembles a triangle and the discharge curves show a good discharge platform at around 1.3 V, suggesting rapid I–V response and good electrochemical reversibility. The relationship between the specific capacitance and current density during charging–discharging is shown in Fig. S7(b)† which shows that the capacitance of the device is up to 149.01 F g−1 at a current of 2 A g−1. The performance of our device is better than that of CoMoO4@Co3O4 NPF//CNTs ASC (128 F g−1 at 3 A g−1),35 NF–Co2AlO4@MnO2//NF–Fe3O4 (99.13 F g−1 at 1 A g−1),53 and NiCo2S4@Co(OH)2//AC (100.94 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1)26 and comparable to that of NMO-NS//AC ASC (151.7 F g−1 at 1 A g−1)15 and Co3O4@CoMoO4//Co3O4@CoMoO4 (148.4 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1).37Fig. 8(c) reveals the outstanding cycling life of the device up to 10000 times at a large charging–discharging current of 100 mA, which has rarely been demonstrated from quasi-solid electrolyte based hybrid devices. Because of the activation process, the cycling capability of the hybrid device is completely activated and improved dramatically in the first 2800 cycles (100% capacitance after 2800 cycles). When approaching 5800 cycles at a large current, the capacitance exhibits an 8.1% loss and after this attenuation, the capacitance stabilizes in the following 2400 cycles. The cycling ability of our device under a large current density is better than that of most devices shown in Table 2.

To explain the significant attenuation of the hybrid device with cycles, EIS is performed. The Nyquist plots of the newly fabricate ASC device and 10000th charge–discharge cycles, the corresponding equivalent circuits and fitting parameters are presented in Fig. 8(d) and can be analyzed as follows. The spectra at frequencies above 2 kHz are dominated by connections including external cell connections, electronic conduction between the substrate and active materials, and ionic conduction through the electrolyte. In our circuit model, the resistor R0 is used to simulate the pure resistive behavior. The semicircle between 2 kHz and 50 Hz is related to the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer which can be simulated by a resistor R1 in parallel with a constant phase-angle element (CPE) named CPE1. The impedance between 50 Hz and 0.01 Hz can be attributed to the charge transfer and diffusion of OH− ions from the reaction interface to the bulk of the porous of the OMEP. Another CPE named CPE2 in parallel with resistor R2 is employed to simulate the charge transfer behavior. Finally, a Warburg impedance W0 is used to simulate the behavior of diffusion of OH− ions.
According to the table in Fig. 8(d), the contact resistance R1 of the sample after 10000 cycles is 1.434 Ω which is smaller than that of the initial sample (1.727 Ω) because active substances participate more in the chemical reactions that reduce the contact resistance. In addition, resistance R2 associated with the SEI layer of the sample after 10000 cycles is 3.44 Ω which is smaller than that of the initial sample (10.42 Ω) perhaps due to more contact between the active substance and electrolyte. R3 for the circular arc diameter after the test is larger than that of the initial sample. It can be attributed to the gradual damage of the Ni coating and structure of CoMoO4@Co3O4/OMEP with time and increasing difficulty for OH− diffusion from the reaction interface to the bulk of the OMEP.
The energy and power densities of the CoMoO4@Co3O4/OMEP in the assembled ASC are calculated according to the equation described as formula (4) and (5) and shown in Fig. 8(e). In addition, literature values of Co-based ternary oxides are given for comparison in Fig. 8(e) and Table 2. The total mass of the active material of CoMoO4@Co3O4 and discharge time are considered in the calculation of energy and power densities. The ASC delivers a maximum energy density of 45.98 W h kg−1 at power density of 1647.5 W kg−1 and even at 10245.6 W kg−1, the device still shows an energy density of 32.359 W h kg−1. As mentioned above, this is one of the best values reported from the ASC configuration irrespective of the positive or negative electrodes. For instance, it is better than CoMoO4@NiMoO4/Ni foam//AC (28.7 W h kg−1 at 267 W kg−1),44 CoMoO4@Co3O4 NPF//CNTs (37.0 W h kg−1 at 6400 W kg−1),35 and Co3O4@NiMoO4//AC (25.3 W h kg−1 at 482 W kg−1)57 and comparable to Co3O4@CoMoO4//Co3O4@CoMoO4 (92.44 W h kg−1 at 6550 W kg−1)54 and CoMoO4@NiMoO4·xH2O//Fe2O3 (26.7 W h kg−1 at 12000 W kg−1).55 The excellent electrochemical performance of the CoMoO4@Co3O4/OMEP electrode and as-assembled ASC can be attributed to the composite nanostructure growing evenly on the surface and side wall of the three-dimensional OMEP substrate thus avoiding agglomeration of the nanomaterials, improving the ion transport efficiency between the nanomaterials and electrolytes, enhancing the cycling ability, and delivering large energy and power densities.
As shown in Fig. 8(f), the three as-assembled ASCs in parallel after charging each device with a large current about 10 s can power four parallel programmable LED arrays efficiently. The LED array as shown in the positive and negative sides in Fig. 8(f) is made up of 1936 small LEDs (11 × 44 × 4) and programmable chips with functional circuits that can be designed by computer. The commercial fan motor is also powered efficiently by the three paralleled as-assembled ASCs at a current density of 0.152 A and voltage of 4.56 V, thus illustrating that our device has good supercapacitive characteristics and large commercial potential in high-performance energy storage systems.
4. Conclusion
The CoMoO4@Co3O4 nanocomposite produced uniformly on a 3D OMEP hydrothermally allows synergistic contributions from the active materials and substrate giving rise to better electrochemical performance. CoMoO4@Co3O4/OMEP has a large specific capacitance of 7.13 F cm−2 (1168.0 F g−1) at a constant current density of 0.6 A g−1 and a retention of 81.4% after 5000 cycles. The hybrid device composed of the CoMoO4@Co3O4/OMEP//AC delivers large specific energy densities at different power densities as well as superior cycling stability. The hierarchical CoMoO4@Co3O4 nanocomposite is promising and bridges the gap between traditional energy storage and power generation device.
