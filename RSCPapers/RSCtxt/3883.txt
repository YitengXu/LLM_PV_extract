    , Accepted 18th February 2019First published on 22nd February 2019AbstractHerein, the electronic structures and absorption spectra of a series of transition-metal-substituted polyoxometalates (TMSPs) were systematically investigated to screen promising candidates for the POM/TiO2 nanocomposite film used in DSSCs using the density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) methods. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) gaps (H–L gaps) of the studied TMSPs were remarkably influenced by the substituted transition metals in different periods. Specifically, the H–L gaps increase as the atomic number of the substituted transition metals increases in the same period such as Mn4+ < Fe2+ < Co2+ < Ni2+ (the fourth row) and Re6+ < Os6+ (the sixth row). Considering that the LUMO energy levels of all the studied TMSPs were higher than the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 (−4.00 eV), the TMSPs could quickly transport the photoinduced electrons as long as the LUMO energy levels of the used dyes were higher than those of the TMSPs. SiW11X4− (X = Mn6+, Ru6+ and Os6+) may perform well in DSSCs using the metal-free organic dye D149 due to the proper LUMO energy levels between the CB of TiO2 and the LUMO energy of D149 (−2.41 eV). The absorption spectra of SiW11X4− (X = Mn6+, Ru6+ and Os6+) exhibit broad absorptions in the UV–vis region that are more conducive to extend the range of light captured; this contributes to enhancing the photo-to-electric conversion efficiency. Moreover, the absorption of SiW11Mn4− red-shifts when compared with that of SiW11X4− (X = Ru6+ and Os6+), which results from the smallest H–L gap; this indicates that SiW11Mn4− will be a promising high-performance material-modified photoanode. This study opens new opportunities for the development of potential TiO2-modified materials for DSSCs.
Introduction
The energy problem has become a major and urgent issue in the world. Solar energy is regarded as an ideal alternative to fossil fuel due to its environmental friendliness. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are a kind of thin-film solar cells that have attracted wide attention owing to their potential advantages, such as low cost, flexibility and easy production processes, as compared to silicon-based cells.1–6 Ever since O'Regan and Grätzel first reported the seminal work on the n-DSSCs,7 the highest promising conversion efficiency is up to 15% at present.8n-DSSCs mainly consist of a dye-sensitized semiconductor photoanode, a counter electrode, and an electrolyte with a redox couple. The photoanode affects the adsorption quantity of the dye, the electron transport, and even the energy conversion efficiency of the DSSCs.9 Generally, several semiconductors, such as TiO2,7 ZnO,10 and WO3,11 have been employed as photoanodes. TiO2 is widely used for the DSSC photoanode; however, it exhibits relatively high photoelectric chemical action only under ultraviolet (UV) light due to its large band gap (3.2 eV).12,13 In addition, the dominant recombination between the injected electrons in the conduction band (CB) of the photoanode and the oxidized electrolyte limits the energy conversion efficiency.14 Thus, an effective way to enhance the light absorption, promote the electron transport and retard the recombination by doping an appropriate electron accepter into the semiconductor film is desirable.15–17
Polyoxometalates (POMs), a class of d-block inorganic metal–oxygen clusters with fascinating structural diversity and electronic versatility, have attracted extensive attention and played important roles in many fields such as catalysis, materials science, magnetism and so on.18–24 In recent years, transition-metal-substituted POMs (TMSPs) have been used in DSSCs. A pure inorganic donor–acceptor (D–A) type TMSP, K6H4[α-SiW9O37Co3(H2O)3]·17H2O (abbreviated as SiW9Co3), was used to prepare the SiW9Co3/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanocomposite, which was introduced into the photoanode of DSSCs and resulted in the improvement of the photovoltaic performance.25 Moreover, three potential Keggin-type TMSPs, TBA8Na2[SiW9O37]·11H2O, TBA4[(SiO4)W10MnIII2O36H6]·1.5CH3CN·2H2O, and TBA3.5H5.5[(SiO4)W10MnIII/IV2O36]·10H2O·0.5CH3CN, were used as pure inorganic photosensitizers for p-DSSCs, and the energy conversion efficiencies were enhanced when compared with those of coumarin 343.26 A Pt counter electrode modified by the tri-substituted α-K3H4[SiW9Al3(H2O)3O37]·7H2O was employed in the DSSCs, and the energy conversion efficiency was significantly increased.27 In brief, TMSPs exhibit many advantages, for instance, long term thermal stability in an electrolyte and can even withstand temperatures up to 600 °C, a higher limit than for organic molecule,28–30 easy modification, ideal energy levels to accelerate the electron transfer and suppress the electron recombination in the cell,31 and broadband light absorption from the UV to the visible region.32,33 In addition, TMSPs have been confirmed to possess a D–A type structure, which is beneficial for electronic transmission34 and ultimately enhances the performance of DSSCs by modifying the photoanode.
Theoretical calculations as reliable ways are crucial to investigate the performance of the DSSCs.35 In our previous study, POM-based dyes were studied by density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations, which could clearly shed light on the relationship between the structures and properties.36–39 To investigate the superior candidates to modify the photoanode in DSSCs, the electronic structures and absorption spectra of TMSPs, including SiW11XO40n− (X = Mn4+, Mn6+, Ru6+, Re6+ and Os6+) and SiW11X(H2O)O39n− (X = Fe2+, Fe3+, Co2+ and Ni2+), were investigated. The studied TMSPs have been abbreviated as SiW11Xn− (X = Mn4+, Mn6+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Ru6+, Re6+ and Os6+) for clarity. The calculation results are expected to provide theoretical guidance to establish a structure-performance relationship and develop efficient TiO2-modified materials for driving the TiO2 film toward visible light utilization and accelerating the electron transfer in DSSCs.
Computational details
All calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 package.40 The ground-state geometries of a series of TMSPs were optimized at the B3LYP41 level with the 6-31G(d) basis set for non-metal atoms and LANL2DZ for metal atoms, and the redox potentials were obtained at the same level. The adsorption spectra of SiW11X4− (X = Mn6+, Ru6+ and Os6+) were simulated by the TD-DFT method. The exchange–correlation functionals PBE042 and M06-2X43 were commonly employed to evaluate the influence of the functionals on the transition energies. A detailed analysis of PBE0 and M06-2X was carried out on the absorption spectra of SiW11Co6−. Compared with the result obtained by PBE0 (285 nm), the simulated absorption spectra obtained by M06-2X (235 nm) is in well agreement with the experimental value (254 nm).44 Hence, M06-2X/6-31+G(d)/LANL2DZ was appropriate to simulate the adsorption spectra in this study using Gaussian functions with the full-width at half maximum of 0.15 eV, and 200 excited states were calculated. The solvent effect of acetic acid was taken into account using the polarizable continuum model (PCM).45
Results and discussion
Molecular structures
The geometrical structures of SiW11Xn− (X = Mn4+, Mn6+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Ru6+, Re6+ and Os6+) are similar, and the structures are presented in Fig. S1.† Considering the effect of the substituted transition metals (X) on the geometrical structures, the bond lengths of X and oxygens (the bridge oxygen Ob and the terminal oxygen Od) were evaluated, and the results and the ionic radius (IR) for the corresponding X are summarized in Table S1.† It can be seen that the bond lengths of X–Ob and X–Od are influenced by different substituted metals, and the shortest bond lengths in SiW11Mn4− resulting from the smallest IR of Mn6+ indicate a strong interaction between Mn6+ and O.
Electronic structures
POM has been confirmed to be an effective electron-transfer mediator for retarding the charge pair recombination and improving the performance of DSSCs in which POM is loaded on the TiO2 photoanode.46–49 In the n-DSSCs, the dye absorbs light, and the electrons of the dye are excited to TiO2 and ultimately transferred to the collector electrode. To accelerate the electron transport from the dye to the CB of TiO2, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the TiO2 modifiers should be higher than the CB of TiO2 (−4.00 eV) and lower than the LUMO energy levels of dyes. The indoline dye D149 is a metal-free organic dye and has achieved a high conversion efficiency of 9.03%.50 Herein, the TiO2 photoanode and the D149 dye were taken as examples to screen appropriate TiO2 modifiers, and the LUMO energy levels are shown in Scheme 1. All the studied TMSPs have an unpaired electron; thus, the molecular orbitals are divided into α- and β-spin states, and the energy levels are presented in Fig. S2.†Via further analysis of the FMOs energies (Fig. 1), it can be seen that the α- and β-LUMO energy levels of SiW11X4− (X = Mn6+, Ru6+ and Os6+) vary between −4.00 and −2.41 eV, indicating that they can act as both an electron acceptor and donor to transfer the photogenerated electrons to the semiconductor surface for promoting the photo-to-electric conversion efficiency of the DSSCs.

The energy difference between the HOMO and the LUMO (H–L) has an effect on the optical properties of the TiO2 modifiers to a great extent, and the smaller H–L gap contributes towards enhancing the visible light-induced photocurrent and photovoltaic response.12 As shown in Fig. 1, the H–L gaps of SiW11Xn− are markedly influenced by the X. When X atoms are in the same group (e.g. group 7: Mn and Re; group 8: Fe, Ru, and Os), the H–L gaps vary from X = Re6+ (2.48 eV) (α-orbital) to X = Re6+ (3.92 eV) (β-orbital) and from X = Ru6+ (2.47 eV) (α-orbital) to X = Fe2+ (3.98 eV) (α-orbital). When X is from the same row of the periodic table, the H–L gaps increase as the X changes in the order of Mn4+ < Fe2+ < Co2+ < Ni2+ (the fourth row). Among them, the smallest H–L gap of SiW11Mn6− is caused by the highest HOMO and the lowest LUMO resulting from the smaller electronegativity of Mn4+. The H–L gap of SiW11X4− for X = Re6+ is smaller than that for X = Os6+ (the sixth row). In addition, the oxidation state of X affects the H–L gap, which is in the order SiW11Mn4− < SiW11Mn6− and SiW11Fe6− < SiW11Fe5−. SiW11X4− (X = Mn6+, Ru6+ and Os6+) are inclined to facilitate the charge transfer from D149 to TiO2 and improve the electron injection efficiency since the LUMO energy levels of SiW11X4− (X = Mn6+, Ru6+ and Os6+) are between the CB of TiO2 and the excited state of D149. The H–L gaps are in the order of SiW11Mn4− < SiW11Ru4− < SiW11Os4−, predicting that the absorption wavelength red-shifts from SiW11Os4− to SiW11Mn4−.
The FMO diagrams of SiW11Xn− (X = Mn4+, Mn6+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Ni2+ and Ru6+) are illustrated in Fig. 2, and those of SiW11Xn− (X = Co2+, Re6+ and Os6+) are depicted in Fig. S3.† The HOMOs are formally constituted by the p orbitals of oxygen, whereas the LUMOs are mostly formed by the d orbitals of the tungsten atoms. For SiW11Mn6−, Mn4+ plays a role in α-HOMO, β-HOMO, α-LUMO and β-LUMO. For SiW11Mn4−, the α-LUMO and β-LUMO consist of the d-Mn orbital, and the substituted metals in SiW11X6− (X = Fe2+ and Co2+) make significant contributions to the α-HOMO and β-HOMO and make small contributions to the β-LUMO. Moreover, Fe3+ and Re6+ contribute to α-HOMO and β-LUMO, and Ni2+ contributes to α-HOMO and β-HOMO, whereas Ru6+ and Os6+ play vital roles in the α-HOMO, α-LUMO and β-LUMO. Therefore, the different X in TMSPs may cause diversity in the charge transition.

Electronic spectra
The TiO2 modifiers not only match the FMO energy levels but also have wide absorption spectra to enhance the photoelectric conversion efficiency. TD-DFT calculations were used to simulate the absorption spectra. Moreover, two exchange–correlation functionals, PBE0 and M06-2X with 25% and 54% Hartree–Fock (HF) exchange, respectively, were selected to evaluate the effect of functionals on the excitation energy of the TMSPs. The simulated absorption spectra data of SiW11Co6− obtained by PBE0 and M06-2X are shown in Table S2.† It can be seen that PBE0 underestimates the vertical transition energy; this is consistent with the previous study.51 The absorption spectrum of SiW11Co6− obtained by M06-2X (235 nm) is in well agreement with the experimental value (254 nm).45 As a consequence, the M06-2X functional was used to predict the absorption spectra of SiW11X4− (X = Mn6+, Ru6+ and Os6+), which could further improve the photo-to-electric conversion efficiency as abovementioned. The simulated absorption spectra are presented in Fig. 3, and the calculated excitation energy (EV), maximum absorption wavelengths (λmax) and oscillator strengths (f) are summarized in Table 1. The absorption spectra of SiW11Mn4− are divided into four absorption ranges: the first intense peak is located in the ultraviolet region, and the other three peaks are observed in the range of 300–400 nm, 400–500 nm and 800–850 nm. For SiW11X4− (X = Ru6+ and Os6+), three absorption peaks are located in the range of 200–300 nm, 300–400 nm and 400–500 nm for SiW11Ru4− and 200–300 nm, 300–350 nm and 350–400 nm for SiW11Os4−. Thus, SiW11X4− (X = Mn6+, Ru6+ and Os6+) have broad absorption spectra that extend to the visible region; this is in favor of improving the absorption response. The maximum absorption bands of SiW11X4− (X = Mn6+, Ru6+ and Os6+) are in the following order: Os6+ (232 nm) < Ru6+ (247 nm) < Mn6+ (332 nm), which is in good agreement with the abovementioned “Electronic structure”. Although SiW11Os4− has the most intensive absorption, SiW11Mn4− has the broadest absorption spectra, meeting the demand of TiO2-modified materials. Hence, SiW11Mn4− can be a potential material to modify TiO2 and can eventually improve the conversion efficiency for the DSSCs. As shown in Fig. 4 and Table S3,† there is a linear relationship between the redox potentials Ered and the α-H–L gaps (the result of the β-H–L gaps is similar to the result of the α-H–L gaps) and λmax. The larger the Ered, the smaller the H–L gap and the larger the λmax. Hence, the maximum Ered in SiW11Mn4− leads to the red-shifted λmax.

Considering that each excitation is composed of many very small electron transitions for these TMSPs, the electron density difference maps (EDDMs) are conducive to consider the multi-configuration character of the excited states and unambiguously characterize the nature of the electron transitions (Table 1). The purple and blue regions represent the electron density depletion and increment, respectively. It can be seen that the maximum absorption of SiW11X4− (X = Mn6+, Ru6+ and Os6+) are mainly contributed to the charge transfer from the oxygen to tungsten atoms and the substituted metals. Accordingly, SiW11X4− (X = Mn6+, Ru6+ and Os6+) could be regarded as the D–A type POM, in which the oxygen atoms acted as an electron donor, whereas the tungsten atoms and substituted metals acted as electron acceptors. In addition, the heat maps (equal to the colored matrix maps) of the transition density matrix (TDM) are depicted in Fig. 5, in which the hole localizes on oxygen atoms, whereas the electron distributes on the tungsten and substituted metal atoms; this is in well agreement with the EDDMs. The corresponding computational detail about the heat maps of TDM is described in the ESI.†

Conclusions
Herein, the electronic structures of a series of TMSPs, including SiW11Xn− (X = Mn4+, Mn6+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Ru6+, Re6+ and Os6+), and the adsorption spectra of SiW11X4− (X = Mn6+, Ru6+ and Os6+) were systematically investigated by the DFT and TD-DFT calculations. The LUMO energy levels of the studied TMSPs are higher than the CB edge level of TiO2; this ensures sufficient driving force for electron injection and transition. In addition, the LUMO energies of SiW11X4− (X = Mn6+, Ru6+ and Os6+) were superior in D149-containing DSSCs, which were between the CB of TiO2 and the LUMO energy level of the dye D149, thus contributing to the accelerated electron transmission and enhanced the conversion efficiency. The substituted transition metals in different periods can obviously affect the H–L gaps, and as the atomic number increases in the same period, the H–L gaps experience slight enlargement. Moreover, the valence states, such as SiW11Mn6− and SiW11Mn4− and SiW11Fe6− and SiW11Fe5−, of transition metals can influence the FMO energy levels. In general, SiW11Mn4− has the smallest H–L gap among all the studied TMSPs and may have good performance in terms of absorption. SiW11X4− (X = Mn6+, Ru6+ and Os6+) have broad absorptions that extend to the visible region, and the absorption wavelength of SiW11Mn4− red-shifts as compared to those of SiW11X4− (X = Ru6+ and Os6+); this confirms the results of the electronic structure analysis, indicating that SiW11Mn4− may be a promising high-performance material to modify the photoanode. It is expected that the present study will be helpful for further investigation and exploration of efficient TiO2 modifiers for eventually enhancing the performance of the DSSCs.
