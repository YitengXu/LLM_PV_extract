    , Accepted 21st July 2021First published on 10th August 2021AbstractTwo-dimensional (2D) heterostructures with the Z-scheme can significantly improve the recombination of the photogenerated charge pairs and increase the overpotential compared with the corresponding monolayers. Based on first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the photocatalytic performance with the Z-scheme of three 2D AuSe/SnS heterostructures identified from nine stacking types of AuSe and SnS monolayers using their formation energies. The thermal stabilities of the chosen heterostructures are assured by molecular dynamics simulations. The band alignment and built-in electric field support the heterostructures to drive the photocatalytic hydrogen and oxidation evolution reactions with the direct Z-scheme. Moreover, the optical absorption of both AuSe and SnS monolayers is obviously observed in the visible light and UV ranges, indicating their excellent response to solar light. The highest solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency of the heterostructures can reach 23.96%. The change in Gibbs free energy in the hydrogen evolution reaction with the heterostructures is in the range of 0.63–0.97 eV, indicating that these reactions are not difficult to carry out. Therefore, the present AuSe/SnS heterostructures could be promising candidates for producing hydrogen from photocatalytic water splitting with the Z-scheme driven by solar light.
1. Introduction
The available power resources on earth are being exhausted because of the continuous development and utilization of non-renewable resources such as fossil coal mines. In addition, harmful gases released by burning oil, coal, and other materials have seriously affected the environment,1–3 causing irreversible air pollution through exacerbating the greenhouse effect. Therefore, a new type of clean and renewable resource should be discovered. Hydrogen energy possesses several advantages. For example, the product of hydrogen combustion is only water, which will not cause any pollution. Hydrogen can also replace gasoline as the fuel for automobile engines. However, the production of hydrogen is not a trivial task, and many researchers have taken constant efforts over the years to determine efficient methods for hydrogen production. Solar light photocatalytic hydrogen production driven by semiconductors is an ideal way for the preparation of hydrogen, because photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen generation has the advantages of low cost, few by-products, and easy realization compared with other hydrogen production methods, such as the electrolysis of water or extraction from fossil fuels. In 1972, Fujishima et al.4 discovered that TiO2 could undergo photocatalytic reactions with water to produce hydrogen. Subsequently, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) driven by semiconductors and light has gradually attracted the attention of researchers.5,6 Two-dimensional (2D) materials have been explored to develop efficient photocatalytic semiconductor materials. For example, graphene,7–11 and monolayer III mono-halogenated compounds and IVB nitrides exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance.12 Liu et al.13–16 theoretically reported that 2D BiP3 and BiMP6 (M = Al, Ga, In) meet the band edge requirements of photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production and have excellent light absorption. In addition, various energy band engineering methods have been studied, including the introduction of a midgap donor level (doped materials)17–20 and the hybridization of nitrogen oxide21–24 and sulfur oxide.25,26
However, the recombination of the photogenerated pairs significantly reduces the HER efficiency. Therefore, the two-step scheme for water splitting was proposed.27 In 2001, the Z-scheme photocatalytic technique involving Cr/Ta-doped SrTiO3 (denoted as SrTiO3:Cr/Ta) was used to demonstrate water splitting under visible-light irradiation.28,29 However, the application of this kind of structure is difficult, because a redox medium is required for the HER. Therefore, a new type of direct Z-scheme without redox medium has aroused widespread interest,30–35 resulting in the vigorous development of photocatalysis with heterostructures. For example, 2D heterostructures such as MX2 (M = Zr, Hf, X = S, Se)36 and the mono-halogenated compound MX (M = Si, Ge, Sn and X = S or Se) also exhibit excellent photocatalytic performance under the influence of pH.37 The 2D vdW-heterostructure of MoSSe/g-GeC is a promising multifunctional system for solar energy conversion.38 2D heterostructures with the Z-scheme can improve the recombination of the photogenerated carriers and increase the overpotential compared with the corresponding monolayers. For the monolayers, the photogenerated electrons at the conduction band minimum (CBM) can directly return to the valence band maximum (VBM) and recombine with the photogenerated holes, thus competing with the reduction of H at the CBM and decreasing the H generation ratio. For the Z-scheme with a heterostructure comprising A and B monolayers, the photogenerated electrons of the A monolayer can reach the VBM of the B monolayer. Moreover, the VBM energy of the B monolayer is higher than that of the A monolayer, and the built-in electric field between the two monolayers is suitable. As a result, the photogenerated electrons at the CBM of the B monolayer and the photogenerated holes at the VBM of the A monolayer catalyze the HER and oxidation evolution reaction (OER), respectively. Thereby, the recombination between the photogenerated electrons and holes on different monolayers for the HER and OER reactions has a low chance of occurrence.
The HER and OER can be completed if the CBM and VBM of the monolayer match the reduction and oxidation potentials at the same time. Hence, a large bandgap is needed if a large overpotential is expected. However, a very large bandgap will decrease the optical absorption in the visible light range, thus reducing the solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency. For the direct Z-scheme heterostructure, the overpotentials of the HER and OER are determined by the two monolayers. Moreover, the optical absorption is also determined by the bandgaps of the monolayer. Hence, the overpotential can be increased by choosing suitable monolayers with either a low VBM or a high CBM, indicating that the bandgaps of the monolayers are unnecessarily large. Therefore, both the enhancement of optical absorption in the visible light range and large overpotentials can be achieved. Therefore, the direct Z-scheme of heterostructure could exhibit better photocatalytic performance compared with the monolayers. However, the construction of the direct Z-scheme with the heterostructure for the visible-light photocatalytic HER is not a trivial task. Both the lattice mismatch and band alignment limit the design of a new heterostructure. Moreover, the electronic and optical properties of the monolayer components must be understood fully.
Tang et al.39 reported that the AuSe monolayer has an indirect bandgap of 1.89 eV, and Gong et al.40 found that the 2D AuSe semiconductor possesses a strong light absorption coefficient (∼105 cm−1) and an ultra-high carrier mobility (103–105 cm2 V−1 s−1) which are suitable for photoelectronic applications. The 2D SnS thin plate (Cmme-SnS) is designed by Ram et al.41 by using first-principles calculations. The band edge of the plate is suitable for the redox potential of water, and enhanced light absorption in the visible region was observed. Shukla et al.42 explored the sensing ability of the S-vacancy SnS monolayer and found that the Sv-SnS monolayer could be used as a gas absorbent and a potential material for sensing applications. However, the AuSe/SnS heterostructure has not been explored.
In the present paper, we explore the feasibility of the AuSe/SnS heterostructure with the direct Z-scheme to catalyze the water splitting reaction for the HER under visible-light irradiation based on first-principles calculations. By using the formation energy, we identified three stable heterostructures from nine possible ones. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation was used to confirm the thermal stability of the three chosen heterostructures. To understand the photocatalytic performance of the Z-scheme with the heterostructures, we calculated their electronic and optical properties. The results demonstrate that the band alignment and the built-in electric field of the three chosen heterostructures matched the conditions of the Z-scheme for water splitting to produce hydrogen. Moreover, the components of the AuSe and SnS monolayers exhibit obvious optical absorption in the visible-light and UV regions. The maximum STH conversion efficiency of the heterostructures can reach 23.96%. Therefore, the AuSe/SnS heterostructures are promising candidates for hydrogen generation from water splitting with the Z-scheme under visible-light irradiation.
2. Computational methods
All first-principles calculations of the electronic and optical properties were performed using the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional43 and the projector–augmented–wave (PAW) pseudo potential,44 which are implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) 6.2.0 code.45,46 The van der Waals interaction was described using the density functional dispersion correction (HSE06-D3).47 The cut-off energy for the plane-wave basis set was 500 eV. The geometrical configurations of the AuSe and SnS monolayers and all the considered AuSe/SnS heterostructures were relaxed by HSE06 until the force applied to the atom was less than 0.01 eV Å−1. The convergence criterion of energy was set to 10−6 eV. The first Brillouin zone was sampled using a Γ-centered 4 × 8 × 1 grid for the geometrical optimization and calculations of the electronic properties. A vacuum layer with a thickness greater than 20 Å was adopted to eliminate the effect of spurious interactions between two layers. AIMD simulations were performed using VASP with a 2 × 4 × 1 supercell.48,49 The calculation details of carrier mobility and theoretical STH efficiency are presented in the ESI.†
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Geometrical configurations of the AuSe/SnS heterostructure
The geometrical structures of the AuSe and SnS monolayers were first optimized to construct an AuSe/SnS heterostructure. The obtained lattice parameters of a = 3.68 and b = 6.02 Å for the AuSe monolayer are close to those of the calculated values of a = 3.65 and b = 5.97 Å by Tang et al.,39 while the value a = 3.71 Å for the primitive cell of the SnS monolayer is in good agreement with the theoretical value of 3.80 Å determined by Do et al.50 The indirect bandgaps of 1.89 and 3.03 eV for the AuSe and SnS monolayers also agree with the theoretical values of 1.85 and 2.89 eV,39,50 indicating that the present theoretical level is reliable for the calculations of the AuSe and SnS monolayers, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Therefore, we used the same theoretical level to investigate the heterostructures of the two monolayers.
The positions of each monolayer in the lattice have three possible types, because the monolayer overturns relative to the symmetry axis along with the direction of zigzag (armchair) do not change the crystal mismatch ratio, resulting in nine possible configurations of the heterostructure with different stacking ways, as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. S2 (ESI†). The dashed lines of the rectangle represent the cells of each configuration. A, Ax, and Ay represent the positions of the AuSe monolayers, and S, Sx, and Sy represent those of SnS, resulting in nine heterostructures, including AS, ASx, ASy, AxS, AxSx, AxSy, AyS, AySx, and AySy. All the possible configurations were optimized to identify more stable ones. The stability of the configurations was evaluated using the formation energy Ef, which is defined as follows: Ef = EHet − EAuSe − ESnS(1)where EHet, EAuSe, and ESnS represent the energies of the heterostructure, the AuSe, and SnS monolayer, respectively. The formation energy Ef, interlayer distance dil, and lattice parameters (a, b) for the optimized heterostructures are summarized in Table 1. The Efs by HSE06 was negative for all the considered configurations of the AuSe/SnS heterostructure, indicating that the energy is stable. Table 1 also demonstrates that the largest absolute value of Ef and smallest dil are attributed to the AyS configuration, indicating that it has the most stable energy. Considering that the absolute values of Ef for the AS, AxS, and AyS configurations are higher than those of the other ones, we further investigated the three configurations. Hence, the AS, AxS, and AyS configurations were further investigated, and their thermal stability was assured with AIMD simulations. As shown in Fig. S3 in the ESI,† the binding energies of each AuSe/SnS heterostructure oscillate around a constant value in the long simulation time range, and the geometrical structures do not show significant changes at 400 K, indicating that the considered heterostructures are thermally stable at the temperature.

3.2 Band alignment, effect of strain, and Z-scheme of the AuSe/SnS heterostructures
The electronic properties of AuSe and SnS monolayers were calculated and analyzed first. The band structures and density of states in Fig. S4 (ESI†) provide the indirect bandgaps for the AuSe and SnS monolayers of 1.89 and 3.03 eV, respectively. The present bandgap of the AuSe monolayer is the same as the value obtained by Tang et al.,39 indicating that the present theoretical level is reliable. The band energy alignments and the total density of states of the three AuSe/SnS heterostructures chosen in the last section are calculated by HSE06, and the results are presented in Fig. 2 and 3. The absolute band edges (EAbsCBM/VBM) can be obtained using the equation EAbsCBM/VBM = EHSE06CBM/VBM − Vvac. Here, EHSE06CBM/VBM represents the energy of the CBM/VBM, and Vvac is the vacuum energy level by HSE06. The Vvac is determined from the asymptote values of the static potentials in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The projected CBM/VBM and bandgaps for the AuSe and SnS monolayers in the heterostructures are calculated and collected in Table 2. The Vvac in Fig. S5 (ESI†) has different values for the sides with the AuSe or SnS monolayers because of the intrinsic electric field. Accordingly, we constructed the Z-scheme with three different Vvac values for the photocatalytic performance, as in the case of M2X3 (M = Al, Ga, In; X = S, Se, Te) by Fu et al.51 As shown in Fig. 4, considering the vacuum level difference ΔΦ at the two surfaces of the heterostructure under strain in Tables S1–S9 (ESI†), we constructed the Z-schemes for each configuration of the AuSe/SnS heterostructure. The calculation details are shown in the ESI.† According to the band alignment in the Z-scheme, the HER occurs in the SnS side (high vacuum level), while the OER occurs in the AuSe side (low vacuum level). Therefore, the HER and OER could each have unique Vvac (I-Vvac). However, we also consider the two other cases, where only high or low Vvac is used. The low Vvac at the side with the AuSe monolayer is represented by II-Vvac, and the high Vvac at the side with the SnS monolayer is represented by III-Vvac. The absolute band edges, including those under biaxial strain, were obtained using different Vvac values and the projected band energies from the heterostructure, as shown in Fig. 5. The CBMs and VBMs of the AS and AxS configurations under all the considered strains match the condition of the HER + OER for hydrogen generation, regardless of any one of the three vacuum energy levels. However, for I-Vvac and III-Vvac, the CBM of the AyS configuration can only match the HER conditions under large biaxial strain, although the VBM always satisfies the OER requirement. Both the CBM and VBM can straddle the redox potential of the HER + OER under the all considered strains if II-Vvac is used.

 Fig. 5  The effects of biaxial strain on the work band edges (the VBM of the AuSe monolayer and the CBM of the SnS monolayer) for the Z-scheme in the AuSe/SnS heterostructure. Three Vvac cases are considered. 
Based on the band edges of the constructed Z-schemes, we calculated the STH efficiency (ηSTH) and the STH  corrected by ΔΦ to evaluate the conversion efficiency from solar energy to hydrogen. The control effect of the biaxial strain was also included. The computational details are presented in the ESI,† and the results are summarized in Tables S1–S9 (ESI†). For I-Vvac, the  values of the AS and AxS configurations are 17.79% and 14.60%, respectively. Moreover, strain engineering can significantly promote . Subsequently, the maximum  values of the three AuSe/SnS heterostructures can reach 21.48%, 21.24%, and 11.41%, respectively. For II-Vvac and III-Vvac, the minimum value is 10.19%. Additionally,  can be promoted by strain engineering and reach 23.96%. Therefore, the present AuSe/SnS heterostructure can efficiently convert solar energy to hydrogen with the Z-scheme photocatalytic HER. More calculation details are shown in the ESI.†
The electron transfer between the interface of the two monolayers in the heterostructure is necessary for the Z-scheme to drive the HER + OER performance, which can be completed by the favorable potential difference between the CBM and VBM of the two monolayers, and the direction of the built-in field at the interface between the two monolayers. Considering the potential difference from the band edges in Fig. 4, the electrons could transfer from the CBM of the AuSe monolayer to the VBM of the SnS monolayer. However, the realization of the transfer process also needs the impelling of the intrinsic electric field. To identify the field, we calculated the plane-integrated electron density difference of the AuSe/SnS heterostructures along the z-axis as follows: Δρ = ρHet − ρAuSe − ρSnS(2)where ρHet, ρAuSe, and ρSnS are the plane-averaged electron densities of the AuSe/SnS heterostructure and the AuSe and SnS monolayers, respectively. The results in Fig. S6 and S7 (ESI†) demonstrate the electron transfer from the SnS to the AuSe monolayer when the AuSe/SnS heterostructure is formed. Besides, the Bader charge-population analysis52–54 was used to quantitatively evaluate the charge transfer in the AuSe/SnS heterostructure. The results show that the transformed charges from the SnS to AuSe monolayer are 0.15, 0.15, and 0.24 |e| of electrons for the AS, AxS, and AyS configurations, respectively. As a result, the electron depletion in the SnS monolayer and accumulation in the AuSe monolayer lead to a built-in field from the SnS to the AuSe monolayer at the interface. The built-in field drives the movement of the photogenerated electrons in the AuSe to the SnS monolayer, thus facilitating the combination of the photogenerated holes in the SnS monolayer and leaving the electrons to achieve the HER. The left holes on the AuSe monolayer complete the OER. Therefore, the present AuSe/SnS heterostructures are preferable candidates for photocatalytic water splitting of the HER with a direct Z-scheme.
3.3 Mobility and optical properties of monolayers

3.3.1 Mobility of the AuSe and SnS monolayers. 
Mobility is necessary to evaluate the photocatalytic properties, because the photogenerated charge pair can play its role only when they are transferred to the surface of the material. The carrier mobility was calculated according to the details in the ESI,† and the results are summarized in Table S10 (ESI†). In the SnS monolayer, the carrier mobility in both the directions has the same order of magnitude. For the carrier mobility of a 2D system, the larger the difference between the electron and hole mobility is, the smaller the probability of electron–hole pair recombination will be to improve the utilization ratio of electrons and holes under lighting conditions, improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency, and ensure ideal conditions of photocatalytic hydrolysis to produce hydrogen.


3.3.2 Optical properties. 
The optical absorption of the two monolayers limits the efficiency of the heterostructure, because the direct Z-scheme requires the photoexcitation to proceed on the two monolayers separately. Therefore, the optical absorption of the AuSe and SnS monolayers in the heterostructure is necessary to evaluate their response to light. The geometrical configurations of the SnS and AuSe monolayers in the heterostructures are deformed by the interaction between the monolayers and are different from those of the individual monolayers. In a report about the GeS/WS2 heterostructure by Ju et al.,55 we calculated the dielectric function and optical absorption of the SnS and AuSe monolayers by HSE06 by using the structures of the monolayer from the AuSe/SnS heterostructure. The optical absorption α(ω) of the individual monolayer can be obtained as follows:56 (3)
Here, the dielectric function ε2(ω) was calculated using HSE0657 as follows: (4)where |Mc,υ(κ)|2 in the equation is the momentum matrix element, and c and υ represent the conduction and valence states, respectively. The real part ε1(ω) is derived from the imaginary part by Kramers–Kronig transformation.58
The calculated α(ω) is shown in Fig. 6. The monolayers in the heterostructure have apparent optical absorption in the visible and UV-light ranges, ensuring that the heterostructure well responds to the solar light. Besides, the changes of α(ω) for the AuSe and SnS monolayers differ under different configurations. The best respondence in visible-light is attributed to the AS and AyS configurations, and the α values can reach 2.26 × 104 and 2.43 × 104 cm−1, respectively. Therefore, the two monolayers in the AuSe/SnS heterostructure can well respond to the solar light to achieve efficient visible-light photocatalytic water splitting for the HER and OER.

3.4 The Gibbs free energy for the HER
The change of Gibbs free energy for the HER was calculated to further elucidate the catalytic performance of the AuSe/SnS heterostructure. The calculation details are presented in the ESI.† Considering that the band edge of the AyS configuration begins to match the condition of the HER at −3% strain, we determined the Gibbs free energy for the AS and AxS configurations without strain but for the AyS configuration with −3% strain. Various possible absorption sites, including S6 (in AS and AxS), S9 (in AS and AxS), Se6 (in AS), Se1 (in AxS), S5, S7, and Se2 (in AyS), were considered. The fully relaxed geometrical structures are shown in Fig. 7, and the adsorption energies are presented in Table S11 (ESI†). The calculated Gibbs free energy difference (ΔGH) between the absorbed H* atom and gaseous H2 is illustrated in Fig. 7. The ΔGH values of both AS and AxS are in the range of 0.73–0.93 eV, although the absorption sites are not completely the same. The ΔGH values for the different absorption sites of the AyS configuration are in a larger range of 0.63–0.97 eV. The present ΔGHs value is smaller than the theoretical 2.7 eV of the N-doped Ni3S2.59 Moreover, Kuznetsov et al.60 confirmed experimentally that the 2D Mo2CO2 and Mo2CO2:Co can drive the HER with a ΔGH value of 0.4–1.5 eV, indicating that the present AuSe and SnS heterostructure driven HER reactions with a ΔGH value in the range of 0.63–0.97 eV could also be achieved experimentally.
 Fig. 7  The Gibbs free energies of the HER at different adsorption sites on the AS, AxS and AyS configurations. The hydrogen atoms absorbed on the heterostructures are represented with H* and labeled with red color on the structures. The vertical axis shows the change of the Gibbs free energy. 
Based on Fig. 5c and 7c, the CBM of the AyS configuration can only match the HER conditions under large biaxial strain, indicating that the HER cannot operate over strain-free AuSe/SnS. However, the AyS configuration shows the lowest Gibbs free energy in Fig. 7c, indicating that the HER can operate on the AyS configuration more easily from the thermodynamics point of view. These findings were obtained, because the band edge position and the Gibbs free energy are different conditions for the two-step HER reaction. The CBM position represents the excited energy for overcoming the reduction potential to complete the H+ + e− → H* step, while the Gibbs free energy restraints the 2H* → H2 step of the HER reaction. Moreover, the CBM position is determined by the band alignment, while the Gibbs free energy is determined by the change in enthalpy and entropy in the process of combining two hydrogen atoms to form a hydrogen molecule. Therefore, these conditions are independent for the HER reaction. The electronic properties of the AyS configuration indicate that the CBM can only match the HER condition under large biaxial strain, but the larger adsorption energy between the H* and AyS results in a smaller change of enthalpy for the 2H* → H2 step, thus inducing a smaller change in Gibbs free energy.
4. Conclusion
In summary, the feasibility of the photocatalytic HER + OER for hydrogen generation driven by the AuSe/SnS heterostructure with the direct Z-scheme was investigated based on HSE06 calculations. We constructed nine configurations of the AuSe/SnS heterostructure according to the symmetry of the AuSe and SnS monolayers and found that three configurations have apparent formation energies than the other ones. The band alignment, density of states, charge transfer, and built-in field for the three configurations were obtained to evaluate the photocatalytic performance with the Z-scheme. All the results demonstrate that all the considered configurations of the AuSe/SnS heterostructures, except for the AyS with I-Vvac and III-Vvac, can satisfy the redox potential condition for the water splitting reaction of the HER for hydrogen generation with the Z-scheme. In addition, we observed the optical absorption of the AuSe and SnS monolayers in the visible-light and UV regions, indicating that the AuSe/SnS heterostructure can well respond to solar light. The solar energy to hydrogen conversion efficiency with the direct Z-schemes under three Vvac conditions was obtained for the configurations. The maximum  values for the AS, AxS, and AyS configurations are 18.32%, 14.87%, and 13.67%, respectively. Moreover, strain engineering can change the band edges and significantly promote . Subsequently, the maximum  for the three AuSe/SnS heterostructures can reach 23.96%, 21.96%, and 20.32%, respectively. The smaller Gibbs free energy than those of the typical photocatalysts reveals that the HER catalyzed with the AuSe/SnS heterostructure could be conducted more easily. Therefore, the presently considered configurations of the AuSe/SnS heterostructure, especially the AS configuration, can efficiently convert solar energy to hydrogen with the Z-scheme photocatalytic HER.
