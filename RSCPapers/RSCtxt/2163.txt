    , Accepted 14th March 2012First published on 15th March 2012AbstractIn the present work, we show that metallic Ti thin films on FTO glass can be completely anodized to a mesoporous oxide layer using a glycerol–K2HPO4 electrolyte at elevated temperatures (∼180 °C). This results in highly transparent mesoporous oxide coated electrodes that provide a significantly enhanced transparency compared with the classic nanoparticle layers or TiO2 nanotube layers. We show that in electrochromic switching experiments these electrodes therefore exhibit a significantly higher contrast compared to other TiO2 nanostructures. Moreover, this type of anodic titania layer is produced in a fluoride-free electrolyte and adheres very well to the FTO glass, both features that are highly beneficial in view of an application in electrochromic devices.
Introduction
In the past two decades, reports on the fabrication and application of defined TiO2 nanostructures have drastically increased due to a range of functional properties and features that can be provided by low dimensional nanoscale geometries. 1D nanostructures such as nanorods,1 nanowires2 and nanotubes3,4 can be fabricated by various techniques, and in many cases these structures show enhanced chemical, physical and biological properties compared with traditional bulk or nanoparticulate structures. A very straightforward synthesis approach for ordered arrays of TiO2 nanotubes is their formation by self-organizing anodization of a metallic Ti substrate in a “dilute fluoride” electrolyte.3 In this case the oxide is directly back-contacted which is particularly useful for any application of the nanotube layers as electrodes. Therefore, TiO2 nanotube electrodes have been explored in fields such as solar energy conversion systems,5 photocatalysis,6 ion-insertion batteries,7 and electrochromic devices.8–10
Oxide based electrochromic devices operate by reversible field-induced intercalation/de-intercalation of small ions such as H+, Li+ into/from a host lattice (such as TiO2, WO3, V2O5) upon applying an external voltage.TiO2 + xM+ + xe− ↔ MxTiO2 (M: H, Li, Na)
In these materials intercalation results in a change not only in their electronic but also in their optical properties and a colored state is formed; upon de-intercalation the original (bleached) state is re-established again. To produce transparent electrochromic devices, the active material is usually deposited on a conductive glass electrode. Using TiO2 as active material mostly TiO2 nanoparticle layers are compacted on the glass substrate.11–14 Due to the high surface area, these layers provide a high electrochromic contrast.12 In the earlier work, we showed that replacing nanoparticles with vertically aligned TiO2 nanotubes9,10 bears several advantages. In particular, TiO2 nanotubes show a higher transparency and a higher switching contrast compared to e.g. P25 nanoparticles.9,10
Recently, we reported an alternative, fluoride free approach to form thick ordered mesoporous oxide layers on Ti metal sheets.15–17 Anodizing in this case is carried out in the phosphate ion containing glycerol electrolyte at high temperatures (typically 180–220 °C). Depending on the anodization parameters different TiO2 morphologies can be created which we termed mesosponge,15 nanochannel16 and fishbone structures.17 In every case, the structures consist of a well-connected network and provide a considerably higher surface area, higher crystallinity and mechanical stability than TiO2 nanotubes.
In the present work, we demonstrate that it is possible to produce one of these structures, that is, the TiO2 mesoporous structures (but not channels or fishbone) directly on FTO glass by complete anodization of a thin Ti film on FTO, and show that these highly transparent TiO2 mesoporous structures are superior to nanoparticles or nanotubes for high contrast electrochromic applications.
Experimental
Titanium layers, 1.2 μm, 2.5 μm and 3.1 μm thick, were deposited on FTO glass (TCO22-15, Solaronix) substrates at the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Systems (Erlangen, Germany) using electron beam evaporation with a deposition rate of 0.6 nm min−1 at 5 × 10−7 to 2 × 10−6 mbar.
The electrolyte to form TiO2 mesoporous structures was 2–10 wt% K2HPO4 (Sigma-Aldrich) in anhydrous glycerol (99.8% purity, <1% H2O, Fluka). Prior to anodization, the electrolyte was held at 200 °C for 4 h to reduce the water content. Anodization was carried out in a two-electrode system configuration with a Pt foil counter-electrode using a power supply (VLP-2403 pro, Voltcraft) by applying a step voltage of 1 V at 150–180 °C.
We also attempted to grow other morphologies on the thin film substrate in hot glycerol electrolytes (by varying the anodization parameters as described in ref. 16) but all efforts failed – some potential reasons will be discussed later in the manuscript.
Therefore, for comparison we grew nanotubes from thin Ti films on FTO using anodization in ethylene glycol containing 0.15 M NH4F and 3 vol% of additional H2O at 60 V for different times to produce different tube lengths. After anodizing, the specimens were rinsed in DI water and dried in a stream of nitrogen.
As a second reference we prepared TiO2 nanoparticle films on FTO. For this, a commercial TiO2 nanoparticle paste (Ti-Nanoxide D, BET = 120 m2 g−1, Solaronix) was deposited by a doctor-blade technique on FTO glass (TCO22-15, Solaronix) substrates.
To fully crystallize the materials, all samples were annealed at 450 °C for 1 h in air with heating and cooling rates of 30 °C min−1 using a rapid thermal annealer (Jipelec JetFirst100).
For electrochromic measurements, the samples were pressed against an O-ring in an electrochemical cell with a Pt gauze as the counter-electrode and a Ag–AgCl electrode as the reference electrode. The electrolyte was 1 M LiClO4 (99% anhydrous, Chempur) in propylene carbonate (PC) (99.7%, anhydrous, Sigma-Aldrich). For cycling voltammograms and chronoamperometric measurements, an Autolab/PGSTAT30 setup was used. Optical transmission and electrochromic contrast were measured using a USB 2000 white-light source and a Newport 1830-C digital optical power meter. Switching experiments were carried out at a fixed wavelength of 600 nm. The optical transmission of the transparent conductive glass was subtracted from the measured data to obtain the real transmittance through the TiO2 nanostructures. In order to fabricate a prototype electrochromic device, a second FTO glass was used as a counter-electrode. The electrolyte, 1 M LiClO4 in polycarbonate, was injected through drilled holes that were subsequently sealed.
For a morphological characterization of the samples, a field-emission scanning electron microscope and the backscattered electron mode of a scanning electron microscope were used with a Hitachi FE-SEM S4800.
X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) was performed with X'pert Philips MPD (with a Panalytical X'celerator detector) using graphite monochromized Cu Kα radiation (wavelength 1.54056 Å).
Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) and (c)–(e) show cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the TiO2 mesoporous structures (TMS) grown on FTO glass by complete anodization of the evaporated metal layers (Fig. 1(b)). Fig. 1(h) shows the recorded current time transient during anodization. In such current–time transients the current, after a very short initiation time, rises to considerably high values, the porous layer grows (in the example of Fig. 1 within a current density of ∼2 mA cm−2) until the current drops again once the entire layer of metallic thin film is converted to an oxide.

(h) Typical current density transient during anodizing of formation of 1.2 μm TiO2 mesoporous structure on FTO glass formed in 2 wt% K2HPO4–glycerol at 180 °C with 1 V (incl. preheating at 200 °C for 4 h) and formation of only compact oxide layer on FTO glass the case of compact oxides that are anodized under non-ideal conditions. 
It should be pointed out that this conversion to oxide was found to be possible in a much more narrow parameter field than for metal sheets. Only for an optimized electrolyte at a temperature in the range of 150–180 °C and a voltage range of 1–4 V in anhydrous conditions (by preheating at 200 °C for 4 h), could successfully form the structures as shown in Fig. 1(a) and (c)–(e). For all other conditions only the formation of thin compact oxide layers could be observed with a typical exponential drop of the current density to a low steady-state value (in line with a high-field thin compact oxide formation mechanism18). Under ideal conditions, the Ti substrate is completely converted apparently to a TiO2 mesoporous structure with a regular mesoporous morphology over the entire layer (Fig. 1(c)–(e)). The structure contains regular openings of approximately 10 nm size (Fig. 1(a)). The layer thickness of the TiO2 mesoporous structures corresponds to the thickness of the metal layer (Fig. 1(b)). This is in contrast to anodic TiO2 nanotubes that are used for reference (Fig. 1(f)) where usually the anodic layer thickness is increased during anodization by a factor of 2.6 – this finding has been ascribed to viscoelastic oxide flow during tube forming anodization.19 The present finding, however, shows that such a volume expansion effect does not occur for TiO2 mesoporous structures. Thus we consider the formation of TiO2 mesoporous structures in a K2HPO4–hot glycerol electrolyte to be based on a field assisted dissolution reaction.20 We ascribe the fact that we could not grow other morphologies on thin films (such as channel or fishbone structures) to the different morphology of the samples. I.e., the polycrystalline nature of commonly used metal sheets exposes various grain orientations to the electrolyte which show a different oxidation reactivity21 while evaporated films can have an entirely different texture. While the detailed role of grain orientation and texture is not entirely clear at present, it is evident that a clear difference between bulk Ti and thin film substrates is observed.
For the mesoporous layers formed on the Ti thin films, XRD spectra were taken as shown in Fig. 2(a). It is apparent that the “as formed” layer is to a large extent amorphous but after annealing at 450 °C can be fully converted to an anatase structure (Fig. 2(b)).
 Fig. 2  XRD spectra of 3.1 μm thick TiO2 mesoporous structures (TMS) before (a) and after annealing (b) at 450 °C for 1 h. The peaks are annotated as anatase (A) and FTO substrate (S). 

Fig. 3 shows transmittance spectra for the different TiO2 nanostructure layers after annealing. All spectra sharply drop for wavelengths <400 nm – this corresponds to the strong UV absorption of TiO2 (Eg(anatase) = 3.2 eV). However, transmittance (T) measurements clearly show that the TiO2 mesoporous structures over the entire investigated wavelength range exhibit a higher transparency than TiO2 nanotubes or TiO2 nanoparticle layers. In the visible range, the TiO2 mesoporous structures show T > 70%, a transparency that is close to the plain FTO glass (T = 80% transmittance). However, TiO2 nanotubes and the nanoparticle layers on FTO glass show only T ≈ 45% and T ≈ 35% in the visible range. This can be ascribed to the much larger feature size provided by the tube layers, and nonhomogeneous agglomerates in the particle layers, which lead to increased losses by light scattering. This is also very clear from the optical images of the different transparent layers shown in Fig. 3.

Fig. 4(a) shows cyclic voltammograms (CVs) for the different TiO2 nanostructures of the same thickness (3.1 μm) acquired in the LiClO4–PC electrolyte. From the anodic and cathodic sweeps the corresponding cathodic Qc and anodic Qa charges can be extracted. These results for TiO2 mesoporous structures are Qc: 127.9 mC cm−2 and Qa: 117.4 mC cm−2, and for the nanotubes are Qc: 93.9 mC cm−2 and Qa: 84.4 mC cm−2, and for nanoparticles as Qc: 142.3 mC cm−2 and Qa: 116.7 mC cm−2, respectively. Clearly the TiO2 mesoporous structures and nanoparticle layers show higher charge storage capacitance values than nanotubes. This may be directly ascribed to the higher specific surface area of these structures (TMS: 78 m2 g−1, NT: 20–30 m2 g−1 and NP: 120 m2 g−1).17,22

Voltage scanned from 0 to −1.5 V vs. Ag–AgCl. Insets of images show (a) typical colored/bleached states of TiO2 nanostructures during cyclic voltammetry and (b) cross-sectional SEM images of 1.9 μm thick TiO2 nanoparticle layer. 
In order to investigate the magnitude of the electrochromic contrast during switching between the bleached and colored states, we measured absolute transmittance values at 600 nm for the different TiO2 nanostructures. Fig. 5(a) and (b) show these in situ transmittance results obtained during potential pulsing between −1.5 V and 0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). Fig. 5(a) shows that under present conditions for all three TiO2 mesoporous layers a very high contrast is obtained. It should be noted that this value does not correspond to the specific surface area of the individual structures – i.e. structure effects play a key role.
 Fig. 5  Optical transmittance measurement of TiO2 mesoporous structures (TMS), nanotubes (NTs) and nanoparticles (NPs) on FTO glass at 600 nm during cathodic (−1.5 V) and anodic (0 V) pulsing. Comparison of optical transmittance with (a) different thicknesses of TiO2 mesoporous structures (TMS) and (b) different types of TiO2 nanostructures (nanotubes (NTs) and nanoparticle (NP)). (c) Schematic sketch and optical image of prototype electrochromic device fabricated using the mesoporous TiO2 structure in Fig. 1(e) as an electrode (showing the colored and bleached states). 
The switching kinetics is (as expected) the fastest for the thinnest layer – this is particularly apparent from the kinetics when returning to the bleached state. The absolute switching and bleaching rates are relatively slow under the present conditions, and could be somewhat increased by higher applied voltages, and changes in the Li intercalation system.
Nevertheless, more remarkable in our case is that the TiO2 mesoporous structures yield by far the highest coloring contrast in comparison with nanoparticulate or nanotubular layers (Fig. 5(b)). From these data, values for the light absorbance  and coloration efficiency  can be extracted for the different TiO2 structures.23
For the TiO2 mesoporous structures we obtain: A = 1.48, Tb = 72.7%, Tc = 2.4% and ηce = 15.58 cm2 C−1; for the nanotubes: A = 0.38, Tb = 43%, Tc = 18% and ηce = 4.56 cm2 C−1; and for the nanoparticles: A = 0.88 Tb = 31.1%, Tc = 4.09% and ηce = 8.22 cm2 C−1. I.e., clearly the highest coloration efficiency is obtained for the mesoporous layers. Also thinner nanoparticulate layers (Fig. 4(b), inset) show less coloration efficiency (for a 1.9 μm thick layer: A = 0.64, Tb = 43%, Tc = 9.87% and ηce = 6.86 cm2 C−1) than the 3.1 μm thick TiO2 mesoporous layer (Fig. 5(b)).
A prototype electrochromic device with the 3.1 μm thick TiO2 mesoporous structures, as schematically outlined in Fig. 5(c) was fabricated by using a second FTO glass as a counter-electrode. The optical images in Fig. 5(c) show the prototype electrochromic device (left hand) under anodic potential and colored state (right hand) with cathodic potential. Clearly the device is uniformly colored and could be operated durably and reversibly.
Another noteworthy point when comparing the mesoporous layers with nanotubes is that TiO2 nanotubes directly grown on FTO glass show a relatively weak mechanical stability due to the presence of a disbonding fluoride rich layer at the bottom24 (when anodization is carried out in fluoride containing solutions fluoride ion transport competes with O2− transport through the growing film and finally fluoride ions accumulate at the oxide–substrate interface). These layers are not very mechanically stable. As a consequence, nanotubular layers are potentially at risk to flake-off by various mechanisms. Moreover, fluorides may induce etching of the conductive glass layers and thus lead to a gradual deterioration of the device.
In order to compare the adhesion of the different layers to the substrate, we performed a “Scotch®”-test (see Fig. 6). I.e., adhesive tape was pressed on the surface of the anodized structures (insets of Fig. 6(a)) and ripped off. After the test, if the layers are inspected with an optical microscope, we can obviously observe that mesoporous layers are well adhered and stable on FTO glass (Fig. 6(a)), i.e. are homogeneous and crack-free, while TiO2 tube layers (Fig. 6(b)) show many crack fissures and in some cases entire flakes of nanotube layers can be lifted off.

Conclusions
The present work demonstrates how transparent anodic self-organized TiO2 mesoporous structures can be produced on FTO glass. The structures provide a significantly higher transparency than comparable nanoparticle or nanotubular layers. This allows for a very high electrochromic contrast when used as an active material in a switchable electrochromic device. TiO2 mesoporous structures on FTO glass show, moreover, a very stable attachment to the fluorine doped tin oxide.
