    , Accepted 5th November 2013First published on 12th December 2013AbstractTwo conjugated polymers, PBDT–TBT and PBDT–TTBT, were designed and synthesized. PBDT–TBT has a zigzagged chain conformation (Z-type), while PBDT–TTBT has a linear chain conformation (L-type). The results show that the polymer chain conformation significantly affects the optoelectronic properties of the polymers. With the conformation change from Z-type to L-type, the J-aggregation of the polymer was enhanced greatly, i.e. PBDT–TTBT shows a much more prominent absorption shoulder peak at the long wavelength direction compared to PBDT–TBT. In the X-ray diffraction analysis, it was found that the L-type polymer shows much stronger crystallinity than the Z-type polymer. Benefiting from the enhanced inter-chain π–π stacking effect, the blend of PBDT–TTBT/PC71BM showed higher hole mobility compared to the blend of PBDT–TBT/PC71BM. The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the polymer solar cells based on PBDT–TTBT/PC71BM and PBDT–TTBT/PC71BM are 6.3% and 4.9%, respectively. These results clearly reveal that the backbone conformation is an important issue for improving the intermolecular interaction of conjugated polymers, and hence provides a guideline for the molecular design of conjugated polymers.
Introduction
In recent years, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention due to their unique features such as low cost, low weight and capability to be fabricated into flexible large-area devices.1–5 The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure,6 in which a donor–accepter bicontinuous interpenetrating network can be formed, has played a leading role in improving the photovoltaic performance of PSCs.7–10 Since the photovoltaic performance of PSCs is closely correlated with the morphology of the BHJ blend, how to control the morphology is an important topic towards achieving high photovoltaic performance.11–25 Therefore, considerable attention has been drawn to modulate the morphologies of the BHJ blends, and many useful processing methods, such as slow growth,26 thermal annealing27 and the use of additives28 and mixing solvents,29 have been successfully employed to promote the formation of nano-scale phase separation with appropriate aggregation size as well as the ordered inter-chain packing of polymers. Thereby the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs can be improved significantly.
Besides these processing methods, the morphologies of the BHJ blends can also be tuned effectively by modifying the molecular structures of the conjugated polymers. For example, our recent work showed that when the donor units (benzodithiophene, BDT) in a D–A polymer named as PBDTTT–S–T were replaced by dithienobenzodithiophene (DTBDT),30 the backbone conformation of the polymer can be changed from a zigzagged conformation to a linear conformation. Consequently, stronger intermolecular stacking as well as better hole mobility can be realized, which is favorable for achieving higher photovoltaic performance.31 Recently, more and more reports have shown that the bridge units between the donor and the acceptor moieties in D–A polymers play important roles in molecular design, and when different bridge units were employed in D–A polymers, the morphologies of the BHJ blends, as well as their photovoltaic properties, varied distinctly.32–35 However, the influence of the bridge units on backbone conformation, as well as the morphologies of the BHJ blends, has been seldom investigated. Therefore, from the point of view of the molecular design of D–A polymers, we synthesized and characterized a pair of D–A polymers with very similar donor and acceptor moieties but different π-bridge units, named as PBDT–TBT and PBDT–TTBT and shown in Scheme 1, to provide insight into the correlation among the backbone conformations of the polymers, the morphologies and the photovoltaic properties of the BHJ blends.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and thermal properties
Three monomers, 4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo-[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT–T),36 5,6-bis((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (TBT),37 and 5,6-bis((2-butyloctyl)oxy)-4,7-bis(thieno[3,2-b]thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (TTBT),38 were synthesized by reported methods. PBDT–TBT and PBDT–TTBT were prepared by the Stille coupling polycondensation reaction using Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst and toluene as the solvent. These two polymers show good solubility in commonly used organic solvents such as chloroform, toluene, chlorobenzene and o-dichorobenzene. The molecular weight and polydispersity (PDI) of the polymers were estimated by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using monodispersed polystyrene as the standard and chloroform as the eluent. The thermal stability of these two polymers was investigated by thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA). As shown in Fig. 1, the TGA plots reveal that the onset decomposition temperatures with 5% weight loss (Td) of PBDT–TBT and PBDT–TTBT are 326 °C and 320 °C, respectively.

The optimized geometries of the backbones of these two polymers were demonstrated by density functional theory (DFT) with a chain length of n = 2, at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory in a vacuum using the Gaussian 09 program package. As shown in Fig. 2, these two backbones show similar planarity in their side views; the backbone of PBDT–TBT shows a typical zigzagged conformation (Z-type) with an angle of 56°, while the backbone of PBDT–TTBT has a straight conformation (L-type). These results clearly indicate that when thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) was used as the π-bridge unit instead of thiophene, the backbone conformation of the polymer can be tuned greatly without changing its planarity. Therefore, the comparisons between these two polymers can give solid information for the correlations among the backbone conformations, the morphologies and the photovoltaic properties.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were used to reveal the crystallinity of the two polymers in thin films. The XRD patterns of the films of PBDT–TBT and PBDT–TTBT casted from o-DCB are shown in Fig. 3. It is very clear that no peak can be observed in the diffraction pattern of the PBDT–TBT film, implying that the PBDT–TBT film is amorphous and no ordered packing can be formed in the film. However, the PBDT–TTBT film shows two diffraction peaks at 2θ = 4.78° (100) and 24.62° (010), corresponding to the laminar packing with a d-spacing of 18.4 Å and intermolecular π–π stacking with a distance of 3.61 Å respectively. The results indicate that the L-type backbone conformation is more favorable to the formation of ordered laminar packing and stronger π–π stacking compared with the Z-type backbone conformation. Consequently, the enhanced π–π stacking is beneficial to inter-chain charge transport, so the PBDT–TTBT film should possess a higher hole mobility compared to the PBDT–TBT film.

The UV-Vis absorption spectra of PBDT–TBT and PBDT–TTBT in solution and in thin films are shown in Fig. 4a and b respectively. In solution, PBDT–TBT shows an absorption peak at 556 nm; in a solid film, the absorption peak is red-shifted to 578 nm, and meanwhile, a shoulder peak at 612 nm appears, which should be due to the enhanced intermolecular π–π* transition. Interestingly, PBDT–TTBT shows a very strong J-aggregate in solution (on account of its strong low energy absorption peak), indicating that the L-type backbone conformation leads to strong intermolecular interactions, which is similar to what we observed previously.31 Furthermore, from solution to solid film, the absorption peak of PBDT–TBT is red-shifted by 20 nm, and this phenomenon is quite similar to what has been observed in many other conjugated polymers, implying that the backbone units of PBDT–TBT are twisted in solution but become more planar in the solid state with the assistance of the intermolecular π–π stacking effect. However, from solution to solid film, the absorption spectrum of PBDT–TTBT is almost unchanged. The comparison between the absorption spectra of PBDT–TBT and PBDT–TTBT clearly confirms that the L-type backbone conformation is beneficial to keep the functional groups of the polymer in a well-defined plane without twisting, and therefore enhances intermolecular π–π interactions. These results are coincident with the observations in the XRD measurements.

Fig. 5 shows the electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) plots of these two polymer films on a glassy carbon electrode. The onset points of the p-doping process of PBDT–TBT and PBDT–TTBT are at 0.54 V and 0.35 V respectively, corresponding to HOMO levels of −5.27 eV and −5.09 eV.39 Since it is very hard to obtain a sharp n-doping signal for these two polymers, CV curves of only the p-doping process are provided here, and the LUMO levels were estimated using “LUMO = HOMO + Eoptg”, as listed in Table 1. Compared to PBDT–TBT, PBDT–TTBT has a higher lying HOMO level, which may due to the stronger electron-donating effect of the TT unit than thiophene.

The photovoltaic properties of these two polymers were investigated by fabricating PSC devices. The device structure used in this work is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al. o-DCB was used as the solvent and the concentration of the solutions were 10 mg mL−1 (polymer/o-DCB). Initially, different polymer/PC71BM (D–A) ratios (2:1, 1:1 and 1:2) were scanned. It was found that the optimal D–A ratios for both of the polymer-based devices are 1:1, and thermal annealing at 90 °C for 10 minutes is helpful to improve the photovoltaic performance of the devices. Fig. 6a shows the current density–voltage curves (J–V curves) of the PBDT–TBT-based and PBDT–TTBT-based PSCs under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 light. Table 2 lists the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and PCE of the PSCs. Under the optimal device fabrication conditions, the device based on PBDT–TBT shows a higher Voc than the PBDT–TTBT device, which is consistent with the CV measurements, i.e. PBDT–TBT shows a lower HOMO level compared to PBDT–TTBT. Obviously, the PBDT–TTBT device shows a higher FF and Jsc compared to the PBDT–TBT device. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the PSCs based on PBDTTBT or PBDTTTBT prepared under the optimal conditions are provided in Fig. 6b. Both of the devices show similar EQE values in the blue light region, i.e. from 400 nm to 550 nm, while the PBDT–TTBT device has a stronger response in the longer wavelength direction, i.e. from 550 nm to 700 nm. As mentioned in the UV-Vis absorption measurements, the PBDT–TTBT film exhibits stronger absorption at longer wavelengths due to the enhanced intermolecular π–π* transitions, so the results from the EQE measurements are consistent with the UV-Vis absorption observations. Again, the photovoltaic results confirm that, from Z-type to L-type, the enhanced intermolecular π–π* transitions are beneficial to improving the photovoltaic response region of the PSCs. In addition, the hole mobilities of the polymer/PC71BM blend films prepared under the optimal conditions were measured by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method.40 The hole mobilities of the PBDT–TBT and PBDT–TTBT devices are 1.95 × 10−3 cm2 (V−1 s−1) and 5.63 × 10−3 cm2 (V−1 s−1), respectively. PBDT–TTBT shows a higher hole mobility than PBDT–TBT. Therefore, benefiting from the broader response range and improved hole mobility, the PBDT–TTBT device exhibits a higher PCE (6.3%) than the PBDT–TBT device.

Furthermore, the morphologies of the two kinds of blend films prepared under the optimal conditions were investigated by tapping mode Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 7a and b, the PBDT–TBT/PC71BM blend film shows a very smooth (Rq = 0.39 nm), continuous and featureless surface, while nano-scale phase separation can be clearly observed in the blend film of PBDTTTBT/PC71BM (see Fig. 7d and e), i.e. irregular or fibril light domains with sizes of ≈20 nm can be found, and the film exhibits a relatively higher roughness, Rq = 1.24 nm. TEM images of the blend films are shown in Fig. 7c and f. It can be seen that no large size aggregation can be observed in both two kinds of blend films. However, compared to Fig. 7c, some light fibril-like patterns can be distinguished in Fig. 7f, which matches well with the findings in the AFM images, indicating that when the backbone conformation is changed from Z-type to L-type, the aggregations of the polymer in D–A blend will become larger and also more regular.

Experimental section
Materials
The monomer, BDT–T, was purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc. The monomers, TBT37 and TTBT,38 were prepared by the methods reported in the literature. Pd(PPh3)4 was purchased from Frontier Chemical Co. The other materials were common commercial level and used as received.
Instruments and measurements
UV-Visible absorption spectroscopy was measured by a Hitachi U-3100 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed on a CHI650D electrochemical workstation with a three-electrode system in a solution of 0.1 mol L−1 tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in acetonitrile at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The polymer film was coated on a Pt plate electrode by dipping the electrode into the corresponding solutions and then drying. A Pt wire was used as the counter electrode, and Ag/Ag+ was used as the reference electrode. The molecular weight of the polymers was measured by the GPC method, with polystyrene as the standard and chloroform as the eluent. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a TA Instruments, Inc., TGA-2050 instrument under a nitrogen atmosphere. Thin-film X-ray diffraction (XRD) was recorded on a Bruker D8 Discover thin-film diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å) operated at 40 keV and 40 mA. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) was performed to characterize the surface morphology of the films on a Nanoscope IIIA (Vecco) instrument using the tapping mode. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using a JEOL 2200FS instrument at a 160 kV accelerating voltage.
Device fabrication and characterization
PSCs with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymers:PC71BM/Ca (20 nm)/Al (80 nm) were fabricated as follows: the ITO glass was pre-cleaned and modified with about 40 nm thick PEDOT:PSS (Bayer Baytron 4083) as the anode buffer layer, which was spin-cast from a PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution onto the ITO substrate. The active layer was then deposited on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer by casting from a 10 mg mL−1o-DCB solution. Finally, Ca (20 nm)/Al (80 nm) layers were successively deposited under vacuum onto the photosensitive layer at a pressure of ca. 4 × 10−4 Pa. The thickness of the photosensitive layer was ca. 100 nm, measured on an Ambios Tech. XP-2 profilometer. Except for the deposition of the PEDOT:PSS layers, all of the fabrication processes were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded on an Agilent B2912A Precision Source/Measure unit. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the polymer solar cells was measured under a 1 sun, AM 1.5G (air mass 1.5 global) spectrum from a solar simulator (100 Mw cm−2) using a XES-70S1 (SAN-EI Electric Co., Ltd.) solar simulator (AAA grade, 70 mm × 70 mm photo-beam size). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured by a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3011 instrument (Enli Technology Co., Ltd.).

Polymerization of PBDT–TBT and PBDT–TTBT. 
The polymers were synthesized by the Stille-coupling reaction using Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst, as shown in Scheme 1. The detailed synthetic processes are as follows.
PBDT–TBT:TBT (142 mg, 0.2 mmol), BDT–T (181 mg, 0.2 mmol) and dry toluene (15 mL) were added to a 50 mL two-necked round-bottomed flask. The reaction container was purged with argon for 20 min to remove O2, and then Pd(PPh3)4 (16 mg) was added. After another flushing with argon for 20 min, the reactant was heated to reflux for 10 hours. The reactant was then cooled to room temperature and poured into MeOH (100 mL), and then filtered through a Soxhlet thimble, which was then subjected to Soxhlet extraction with methanol, hexane and chloroform. The polymer was recovered from the chloroform fraction by rotary evaporation as a solid and purified by chromatography on silica gel with chloroform as the eluent, and the polymer solution was concentrated and poured into MeOH. Afterwards, the precipitates were collected and dried under vacuum overnight. Yield: 152 mg (47%).

Conclusions
Two conjugated polymers with different backbone conformations, PBDT–TBT and PBDT–TTBT, were synthesized and characterized. The backbone formation of conjugated polymer plays an important role in realizing ordered and stronger intermolecular packing. When the backbone conformation of the polymer was changed from Z-type to L-type, the polymer showed very strong J-aggregation even in the solution state, and also demonstrated more ordered laminar packing as well as stronger intermolecular π–π stacking in the solid film, and consequently, the hole mobility and photovoltaic performance of the polymer can be improved. Therefore, the results in this work clearly reveal that the backbone conformation is an important issue for improving the intermolecular interactions of conjugated polymers, and hence provides a guideline for the molecular design of conjugated polymers.
