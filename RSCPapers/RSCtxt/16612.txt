    , Accepted 21st March 2018First published on 22nd March 2018AbstractA novel flower-like In2S3/CdIn2S4/In2O3 (ICS) ternary heterostructure (HS) is rationally constructed for the first time by a series of carefully designed procedures. In2O3 nanoflakes are the main constituent units which assemble into a flower-like skeleton structure, and CdIn2S4 nanoparticles are in situ generated on the surface of In2O3 nanoflakes through the transformation of CdS quantum dots (QDs) while In2S3 nanoparticles are in situ produced at the region between CdIn2S4 nanoparticles and In2O3 nanoflakes resulting from a synchronous sulfuration procedure. As expected, the rationally designed ICS ternary HSs display significantly enhanced photocatalytic H2 production, especially ICS5 (sulfurized for 5 h) with the highest H2 evolution rate of 20.04 μmol h−1 (10 mg catalyst is used for photocatalytic reaction), which is 26.7 times and 2.6 times higher than that of pure In2O3 (0.75 μmol h−1) and In2S3/In2O3 binary HS (7.88 μmol h−1), respectively. The enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the multiple interfaces formed in the ICS HSs, including the CdIn2S4–In2O3 interface, the In2S3–In2O3 interface, and the CdIn2S4–In2O3–In2S3 interface, which construct multiple pathways for the transfer of photogenerated charge carriers, effectively promoting the photocatalytic hydrogen production.
1. Introduction
As an eco-friendly energy generation strategy, photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water splitting is promising for addressing environmental and energy issues.1–3 Since Fujishima and Honda reported that TiO2 semiconductors can be utilized as a photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution from water splitting,4 various photocatalysts such as TiO2,5–7 ZnO,8,9 C3N410,11 and transition metal sulfides,12–14 have been developed for photocatalytic application. Particularly, as a special III–VI group oxide semiconductor, indium oxide (In2O3) has attracted increasing attention due to its suitable bandgap (2.8 eV), stable photochemical properties and low toxicity.15–18 In2O3-based photocatalysts have been reported in the removal of volatile organic compounds,16,19 the degradation of organic pollutants,20 the evolution of hydrogen,15,21 and so on. However, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution efficiency of single In2O3 is quite unsatisfactory, mainly due to the high recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers and the limited solar light absorption ability.18,22
To address the two issues, several strategies have been developed, such as facet and morphology control,15 noble metal deposition,17 and heterostructure (HS) construction.16 Among them, the construction of heterostructures (HSs) by coupling In2O3 with other semiconductors with a narrow bandgap has been proven to be the most efficient strategy.16,23 For example, Zhang et al. fabricated α-Fe2O3/In2O3 binary HS, which displayed significantly enhanced photocatalytic efficiency for the degradation of toluene.16 Hou et al. constructed mesoporous In2O3−x/In2S3 HS, which presented a dramatically enhanced photocurrent response in the photo-electrochemical water splitting process.23 In general, three factors mainly contribute to the facilitation of photocatalytic efficiency in the HSs: (1) the formed internal electric field in HSs can force the directional migration of charge carriers and thus facilitate the separation of charge carriers; (2) coupling a wide gap semiconductor with a narrow band gap semiconductor can easily enhance the sunlight response region; (3) the complementary effect among different semiconductors can maximize the merit of each component.24–29
Recently, ternary HSs consisting of three semiconductors have been stimulating more and more attention as they are highly effective for the separation and migration of photogenerated electrons and holes and the expansion of the optical response range. For instance, Yang et al. constructed graphene-CdS-MoS2 ternary HSs, which exhibited a 27 times higher hydrogen evolution rate than pure CdS.30 Hou et al. fabricated CdS QDs/graphene/ZnIn2S4 ternary HSs, which presented a 4 times higher hydrogen evolution rate than pure ZnIn2S4.31 However, there are few reports on In2O3-based ternary HSs, and only one paper can be retrieved from the literature where a flower-like In2O3/AgBr/Bi2WO6 ternary HS was developed, which exhibited high photocatalytic activity for the degradation of Rhodamine B.22
In the current work, novel In2O3-based ternary HSs with a flower-like morphology, In2O3/CdIn2S4/In2S3 (ICS), were successfully developed for the first time by a series of carefully designed procedures. Firstly, In(OH)3 microflowers (MFs) assembled from many thin nanoflakes were prepared through a simple hydrothermal method. Then CdS quantum dots (QDs) were deposited on the nanoflakes (In(OH)3 MFs) by using the successive ionic-layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. Subsequently, the obtained CdS/In(OH)3 was calcined to produce CdSO4/In2O3. Finally, the ICS ternary HSs were obtained by the in situ synchronous sulfurization of CdSO4/In2O3. The schematic diagram of preparation procedures is shown in Scheme 1, where a piece of a nanoflake was selected out to stand for the MFs. As expected, the ICS ternary HSs displayed significantly enhanced photocatalytic H2 production in comparison with single semiconductor and binary HSs.

2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Indium(III) chloride hydrate (InCl3·4H2O, 99.99% metals basis) was purchased from Shanghai Macklin. Co., Ltd, China. Urea ((CO(NH2)2), 99.0%) was supplied by Tianjin Zhiyuan Chemical Reagents Development Centre. Sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS, C12H25NaO4S, 99.0%), thioacetamide (TAA, CH3CSNH2, 99.0%), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), anhydrous sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) and sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, China. Sodium sulfide (Na2S·9H2O) was received from Tianjin Tianli Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, China. Cadmium acetate dihydrate (Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O) was purchased from Tianjin Guangfu Fine Chemical Research Institute, China. Chloroplatinic acid solution (H2PtCl6 8 wt% in H2O) was ordered from Shanghai Aladdin Bio-Chem Technology Co., Ltd, China. All reagents were analytical grade and used as received without further purification. Deionized water with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm was used throughout the experiments.
2.2. Synthesis of photocatalysts

2.2.1. Synthesis of In(OH)3 MFs. 
The In(OH)3 MFs were obtained through a simple hydrothermal method.32 Typically, 0.9 mmol InCl3·4H2O and 2.8 mmol SDS were dissolved in 56 mL of deionized water with strong stirring (500 rpm) for 30 min. Afterwards, 7 mmol urea was added in and stirred for another 1 h. The obtained mixture was then transferred to a Teflon autoclave (80 mL) and maintained at 120 °C for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature naturally, the obtained white solid was washed with deionized water and alcohol three times, respectively, and then dried at 60 °C, resulting in In(OH)3 MFs.


2.2.2. Synthesis of CdS/In(OH)3 MFs. 
CdS decorated In(OH)3 MFs were synthesized by using the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method where CdS QDs were in situ deposited on In(OH)3 MFs.33 One SILAR cycle included two steps: (1) In(OH)3 MFs were immersed in a 0.1 M Cd(CH3COO)2 solution for 5 min and then washed with deionized water; (2) after drying in air, the In(OH)3 MFs were immersed in a 0.1 M Na2S solution for another 5 min and then washed with deionized water. The amount of CdS QDs anchored on In(OH)3 MFs was controlled by adjusting the number of deposition cycles. For convenience, CdS decorated In(OH)3 MFs were denoted as CdS/In(OH)3-x (x stands for the number of deposition cycles).


2.2.3. Synthesis of CdSO4/In2O3 MFs. 
CdSO4/In2O3 MFs were prepared by the heat-treatment of CdS/In(OH)3-x MFs at 500 °C in air for 2 h. During this heat-treatment, CdS QDs were transformed into CdSO4 nanoparticles while white In(OH)3 MFs were transformed into faint yellow In2O3 MFs, resulting in CdSO4/In2O3-x MFs. For convenience, the obtained CdSO4/In2O3-x MFs were denoted as IC-x.


2.2.4. Synthesis of In2S3/CdIn2S4/In2O3 MFs. 
The In2S3/CdIn2S4/In2O3 MFs were synthesized by the in situ synchronous sulfuration of CdSO4/In2O3 MFs.20 Based on the photocatalytic H2 evolution tests over IC-4, IC-8, IC-12 and IC-16, the optimal number of deposition cycles of CdS QDs for the highest H2 evolution rate was determined to be 12 (Fig. S1†). Therefore, IC-12 was used to synthesize In2S3/CdIn2S4/In2O3. In detail, 250 mg of IC-12 MFs was ultrasonically dispersed in 80 mL of deionized water to form a homogeneous suspension. Then 125 mg of TAA was added into the suspension and stirred for 30 min. Subsequently, the mixture was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 150 °C for different times (the sulfurization degree was adjusted by the sulfurization time). After cooling to room temperature, the obtained saffron yellow product was washed with deionized water and alcohol three times, and then dried at 60 °C, resulting in In2S3/CdIn2S4/In2O3 MFs. For convenience, the obtained In2S3/CdIn2S4/In2O3 MFs were denoted as ICSy, where y is the sulfurization time.
In addition, for comparison, In2O3 MFs, CdS/In2O3 MFs and In2S3/In2O3 MFs were also synthesized. In2O3 MFs were prepared by the heat-treatment of In(OH)3 MFs at 500 °C in air for 2 h. CdS/In2O3 MFs were synthesized by depositing CdS QDs on the surface of In2O3 through the SILAR method, and the obtained products were donated as CdS/In2O3-x, where x is the number of deposition cycles. In2S3/In2O3 MFs were synthesized by the sulfuration of In2O3 MFs using the same in situ synchronous sulfuration procedure, and the obtained In2S3/In2O3MFs were denoted as ISy, where y is the sulfurization time.

2.3. Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution
The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water splitting was carried out in a top-irradiation quartz cell connected to a closed glass gas circulation system (CEL-SPH2N, Beijing). 10 mg of photocatalyst was dispersed in 25 mL of aqueous solution with 0.35 M of sodium sulfide and 0.25 M of sodium sulfite as the sacrificial agent, and then 0.1 mL of H2PtCl6 solution (1 mg mL−1) was added as the co-catalyst. The reaction temperature was maintained at around 6 °C. A 225 W xenon arc lamp was used as a simulated solar light source (320–780 nm). The amount of H2 evolution was determined via a TCD gas chromatograph (GC-9720).
2.4. Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Philips X'pert Multipurpose X-ray diffraction system using Cu Kα radiation in step mode between 10° and 60°. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and energy dispersive spectra (EDS) were obtained with a field emission scanning electron microscope (Gemini SEM 500). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained on a JEOL JEM-2100F microscope operating at a voltage of 200 kV. Elemental dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping was performed using a transmission electron microscope (FEI Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin, USA) with an accelerating voltage (300 kV). UV–Visible diffuse reflection spectra (UV-Vis DRS) were recorded with a UV-vis-NIR spectrometer (JASCO, V-670) with an integrating sphere. Raman spectra were taken in a back-scattering geometry using a single monochromator with a microscope (Reinishaw inVia) equipped with CCD array detector and an edge filter. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were performed on a PHI 5300 Versa Probe analyzer with aluminum Kα radiation. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using a fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments FLS 980). Electrochemical analyses were carried out in a conventional three-electrode system and recorded on a CHI 660 E electrochemical workstation (Shanghai, China). For the photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) test, Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode and a Pt slice as the counter electrode. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO, 7 Ω per square) decorated with the catalyst was used as the working electrode. The electrolyte used was Na2SO4 solution (0.1 M). Light switching on and off was controlled by a shutter every 20 seconds to test the photocurrent response. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was carried out in the frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 105 Hz with a bias voltage of 0.5 V. Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots were collected by conducting impedance-potential spectroscopy at 10 kHz over a range of potentials from −0.4 to 0.4 V versus saturated calomel electrode (SCE); the electrolyte was 0.5 M H2SO4 solution; the saturated calomel electrode was used as the reference electrode.34–36
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Crystal structure, morphology and composition

Fig. 1a and Fig. S2† show the XRD patterns of all samples. As displayed in Fig. 1a, the recognized peaks of the hydrolysate of InCl3·4H2O matched well with the standard card of the cubic In(OH)3 phase (JCPDS card 85-1338).32 Due to the low deposition of CdS QDs, we did not observe the diffraction peaks belonging to CdS in the XRD pattern of CdS/In(OH)3-12 (Fig. S2†). After CdS/In(OH)3-12 was calcined at 500 °C in air for 2 h, the peaks belonging to cubic In(OH)3 disappeared while the peaks attributed to CdSO4 (JCPDS no. 86-1558) and cubic In2O3 (JCPDS no. 06-0416) appeared (IC-12, Fig. 1a), suggesting that CdS decorated In(OH)3 MFs were transformed into CdSO4 and In2O3 (CdSO4/In2O3) during this annealing process.37–39 After IC-12 was sulfurized with TAA, the main new peaks indexed to the (311), (400), (511) and (440) crystal planes of cubic CdIn2S4 (JCPDS no. 27-0060) are detected at 2θ = 27.2, 33.0, 43.3 and 47.4°, respectively,40,41 and the peaks at 2θ = 23.32 and 27.39° assigned to the (116) and (109) planes of β-phase In2S3 (JCPDS no. 25-0390) appeared (ICS, Fig. 1a), indicating that CdIn2S4 and In2S3 have been generated. Meanwhile, the intensity of XRD peaks ascribed to In2O3 (2θ = 30.6, 35.5 and 51.0°) gradually decreased with the increasing sulfurization time, meaning that part of the In2O3 is gradually consumed in the generation of CdIn2S4 and In2S3, and the In2S3/CdIn2S4/In2O3 ternary HSs have been successfully constructed. As the XRD patterns of β-phase In2S3 and CdIn2S4 are very similar,42 we obtained the Raman spectra of IC-12 and ICS5 to further confirm the existence of In2S3 and CdIn2S4 in ICS. As shown in Fig. 1b, the peaks at around 307 and 360 cm−1 that appeared in the Raman spectrum of IC-12 can be assigned to the In–O bending vibration of δ(InO6) units and the stretching vibrations of In–O–In bonds in In2O3, respectively,20 and the small peak at ∼330 cm−1 is associated with the surface phonons of the Cd2+ based radical.43 For the ICS5, the Raman peak centered at 247 cm−1 is the T2g mode of CdIn2S4,40 and the peaks at 272 cm−1 and 338 cm−1 are typical modes of In2S3,43,44 demonstrating that both In2S3 and CdIn2S4 exist on the surface of In2O3, forming In2S3/CdIn2S4/In2O3 ternary HSs.

The morphology and composition of several typical samples were investigated by SEM, TEM, and EDS. Pure In2O3 presented a hierarchical flower-like structure with a diameter of about 5 μm (Fig. 2a), and every microflower was assembled by many thin nanoflakes to form a large number of three-dimensional (3D) network channels (Fig. 2b). IC-12 (Fig. 2d and e), ICS5 (Fig. 2g and h), CdS/In2O3-12 (Fig. S3a†) and IS5 (Fig. S3b†) shared the same flower-like morphology as In2O3 MFs. The surface of pure In2O3 nanoflakes was quite smooth (Fig. 2c). In contrast, the surface of nanoflakes in IC-12 was rather rough (Fig. 2f), which can be attributed to the CdSO4 nanoparticles being transformed from CdS QDs. As to ICS5, it can be observed that numerous nanoparticles appeared on the surface of In2O3 nanoflakes, resulting in a fluffy flowerlike structure (Fig. 2i), which can be ascribed to the generated In2S3 and CdIn2S4. EDX mapping was utilized to provide a clear picture of the distribution of the component elements, and a nanoflake was chosen as the test target. It can be observed from Fig. 2j that the S and Cd elements, represented by blue and yellow dots respectively, exhibited roughly the same density. By contrast, as to ICS5 (Fig. 2k), the number of blue dots representing S atoms was much more than the number of yellow dots representing Cd atoms, and roughly equal to the number of pink dots representing In atoms, corresponding to the generation of In2S3 and CdIn2S4 after the in situ synchronous sulfuration procedure. The overlapped mapping of S and In elements can also effectively reveal the loose distribution of In2S3 and CdIn2S4. The percentage content of elements tested by EDS also presented the same rule, as shown in Fig. S4,† the proportion of S atoms increased from 1 at% in IC-12 to 10 at% in ICS5 while the percentage of Cd atoms remained at the initial level of about 1%. The increasing percentage of S is caused by the formation of In2S3 and InCd2S4, resulting from the sulfurization procedure. All of the pieces of evidence powerfully demonstrate that the CdSO4/In2O3 was successfully sulfurized to In2S3/CdIn2SO4/In2O3.

TEM was also carried out to analyze the morphology and microstructure of the samples. It can be observed from Fig. 3a that ICS5 presented a flower-like morphology, which was assembled by many thin flakes composed of numerous well-ordered nanorods (Fig. 3b). IC-12 (Fig. S5a†) and IS5 (Fig. S5c†) also exhibited the same flakes composed of numerous well-ordered nanorods. In addition, there were many nanoparticles anchored on the flakes (Fig. 3c and Fig. S5b and S5d†). The HRTEM images (Fig. 3d) show the identified regions marked as 1, 2 and 3, which displayed the lattice fringes of 0.38, 0.29 and 0.41 nm, corresponding to the (220), (222) and (222) planes of CdIn2S4, cubic In2O3 and In2S3, respectively.20 The In2O3, CdIn2S4 and In2S3 connected intimately with each other to form close contact interfaces of In2O3–In2S3 (Fig. 3d-1), In2O3–CdIn2S4 (Fig. 3d-2) and In2O3–In2S3–CdIn2S4 (Fig. 3d-3), resulting in a ternary heterostructure. Moreover, more TEM images (Fig. S6†) focusing on different regions also confirmed the formation of the heterostructure. Therefore, it can be deduced that the three semiconductors coexist and intimately connect with each other to form ternary heterojunctions, which can not only serve as pathways to facilitate the migration of charge carriers, but also induce synergistic effects for the improvement of photocatalytic efficiency.14,24,32

XPS spectra were obtained to investigate the surface chemical composition of the as-synthesized samples. The survey XPS spectra shown in Fig. 4a verified the presence of the peaks of In 3d, O 1s, Cd 3d, S 2p, and C 1s. The peak of C 1s at about 285 eV can be ascribed to the adsorbed CO2 on the surface or adventitious hydrocarbon from the XPS instrument itself.45,46 As shown in Fig. 4e, IC-12 and ICS5 presented two completely different S 2p spectra. The peaks at 168.5 and 168.8 eV in the S 2p spectrum of IC-12 belonged to the oxidation state of S atoms in CdSO4,39,47 and no peak belonging to S2− was observed, indicating that the CdS QDs were completely transformed to CdSO4 during the heat-treatment process at high temperature.42 As to ICS5, the peaks at 168.5 and 168.8 eV belonging to CdSO4 disappeared and two new peaks at about 161.6 and 162.8 eV assigned to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 photoelectric peaks of S2− appeared, suggesting that the CdSO4 was completely consumed with the generation of In2S3 and CdIn2S4 during the sulfurization procedure.20,40–42,44 These phenomena are in great agreement with the results of XRD. The O 1s peaks of all samples can be deconvoluted into three peaks at 530.1, 531.9 and 533.3 eV (Fig. 4c), which can be ascribed to the lattice oxygen, oxygen deficiency and chemisorbed (or dissociated) oxygen species,39,45,46,48 respectively. It should be noted that the area percentage of lattice oxygen increased from 8.07% in In2O3 to 25.28% in IC-12 (Fig. 4f), corresponding to the formed CdSO4 on the surface of In2O3.37,39 As to ICS5, the area proportion of lattice oxygen (6.81%) was less than the initial level (8.07% in In2O3), which can be attributed to the fact that the outer surface of In2O3 was covered by the formed In2S3 and CdIn2S4, in accordance with the results revealed from the corresponding S 2p spectra. It should be mentioned that, after IC-12 was transformed to ICS5, the peaks of In 3d (Fig. 4b) slightly shifted to a lower energy while the peaks of Cd 3d (Fig. 4d) shifted to a higher energy, which can be ascribed to the strong interaction among In2O3, In2S3 and CdIn2S4.

The composition percentages of IC-12 and ICSy HSs were further ascertained by XPS and EDS measurements, and the results are shown in Tables S1 and S2.† It can be seen that the content of In2S3 in ICS increased gradually with the increasing sulfuration time, accompanied by a decrease in the content of In2O3, which coincides with the results of XRD, suggesting that In2O3 was transformed into In2S3 in the sulfurization procedure. The content of CdIn2S4 was almost constant (about 12 at% for XPS and 8 at% for EDS) due to the constant amount of Cd element.
3.2. Porous characteristics and optical properties
The favorable surface area is expected to accommodate a large amount of superficially active sites to facilitate photocatalytic reaction. The porosity and surface area of the In2O3, IC-12, and ICS5 were examined by N2 adsorption–desorption measurements. As shown in Fig. 5a, the type IV hysteresis loops in the adsorption/desorption isotherms illustrated that the mesoporous structure is included in the samples.24,49,50 Table S3† lists the structural parameters of the as-synthesized samples. The specific surface area (SBET) of the In2O3 is determined to be 60.72 m2 g−1 with the pore volume of 0.47 cm3 g−1, which is similar to that reported previously.24 The SBET of IC-12 slightly decreased to 48.09 m2 g−1 with the pore volume of 0.39 cm3 g−1, which can be ascribed to the fact that some 3D network channels were blocked by anchored nanoparticles. After the sulfurization treatment, numerous In2S3 nanoparticles attached on the surface of In2O3, resulting in a fluffy flowerlike structure. As a result, the SBET of ICS3 and ICS5 exhibited an enhancement in comparison with that of IC-12. Particularly, ICS5 presented the highest surface area (57.99 m2 g−1) due to the fluffy structure. The large surface area with suitable 3D network channels is conducive to the absorption and diffusion of reactant molecules, facilitating the generation of H2 from the water splitting process.14,24 After the sulfurization time increased to 7 h, the obtained ICS7 exhibited a decreased SBET (47.55 m2 g−1), which can be attributed to the superfluous In2S3 aggregated on the surface of In2O3.

The UV–vis DRS spectra and the corresponding Tauc plot for optical-band-gap determination of the samples are shown in Fig. 5b and c, respectively, and the band gap (Eg) was calculated by using the equation α(hν) = A(hν − Eg)1/2, where α, ν, Eg and A are the absorption coefficient, light frequency, band gap energy, and a constant, respectively (Table S4†).51,52 As shown in Fig. 5b, pure In2O3 showed a 440 nm absorption band-edge, corresponding to a band gap energy of 2.8 eV (Table S4†). As to IC-12, a slight red-shift of the absorption edge can be observed at 456 nm (Fig. 5b), the estimated band gap energy was about 2.72 eV (Table S4†), which is probably caused by the formation of the heterojunction between In2O3 and CdSO4. After sulfurization, the absorption band of ICS rapidly shifted to a wavelength of 580 nm (Fig. 5b), the red-shift can be attributed to the formation of narrow band gap semiconductors CdIn2S4 (2.3 eV) and In2S3 (2.0 eV). The IS5 also displayed similar DRS to ICS, indicating the successful generation of In2S3 on the surface of In2O3 due to the sulfurization procedure.
3.3. Photocatalytic performance
The photocatalytic performances of all the samples were evaluated from the photocatalytic H2 production rate from water splitting under irradiation with a xenon lamp. The results are shown in Fig. 6a. Among the samples, pure In2O3 exhibited the lowest H2 evolution rate (0.75 μmol h−1) due to weak absorption to simulate sunlight.45,49 After the in situ synchronous sulfuration procedure, the obtained IS samples presented enhanced photocatalytic activity due to the formation of In2S3/In2O3 binary HS, and IS-5 exhibited the highest H2 evolution rate of 7.88 μmol h−1 (Fig. S7†). After the introduction of CdInS4, the hydrogen evolution rate over ICS was further enhanced due to the formation of In2S3/CdInS4/In2O3 ternary HS (Fig. 6a). Furthermore, the ICS5 displayed the highest H2 evolution rate of 20.04 μmol h−1, which is about 26.7 times higher than that of In2O3, suggesting that the coupling effect among In2O3, In2S3 and CdIn2S4 significantly facilitates the photocatalytic H2 production. We carefully consulted the hydrogen evolution rate over the HSs composed of In2S3, CdInS4, and In2O3 reported in the literature, and only one paper was retrieved where the hydrogen evolution rate of 64.1 μmol/g h−1 was obtained over the In2O3/In2S3 binary HS,53 which is much lower than the hydrogen evolution rate of 2004 μmol g−1 h−1 (10 mg of catalyst was used) over ICS5, demonstrating the high photocatalytic activity of ICS5.

In order to evaluate the stability of this ternary HS, ICS5 was used for photocatalytic H2 evolution for 4 cycles within 12 hours and the crystal structure before and after the reaction was also investigated to evaluate the stability. As shown in Fig. 6b, no significant decline in the H2 evolution rate occurred. Moreover, the XRD patterns of ICS5 before and after the photocatalytic reaction (12 h) matched well (Fig. 6c), further demonstrating the excellent photostability of the as-synthesized ICS5 photocatalyst.
3.4. The separation and transfer of charge carriers
To investigate the origin of the enhanced photocatalytic H2 production over the ICS HSs, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and photoelectrochemical tests were carried out. PL spectroscopy is an efficient method to investigate the separation and transfer efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes because PL emission is generally recognized as the recombination characteristic of charge carriers.54–56Fig. 7a presents the PL spectra of the samples at an excitation wavelength of 270 nm. It can be clearly observed that pure In2O3 exhibited the highest PL intensity due to the quick recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. Both IC-12 and IS5 displayed weaker PL intensity due to the formation of binary HSs, which inhibited the recombination of electrons and holes. ICS5 exhibited the lowest PL intensity, indicating the most effective separation and transfer of charge carriers resulting from the formed In2S3/CdIn2S4/In2O3 ternary HSs.57,58
 Fig. 7  (a) PL spectra, (b) photocurrent–time (i–t) curves, (c) EIS and (d) M–S plots of the samples (inset is the M–S plot of ICS5). 
The photocurrent–time curves of the samples are shown in Fig. 7b. Pure In2O3 exhibited the smallest photocurrent response due to the quick recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. After forming CdSO4/In2O3 and In2S3/In2O3 binary HSs, IC-12 and IS5 displayed enhanced photocurrent due to the inhibition of recombination of electrons and holes. After In2S3/CdIn2S4/In2O3 ternary HSs were constructed, the photocurrent density was further enhanced owing to the more effective inhibition of the recombination of charge carriers. The photocurrent density turns out to be in the order of In2O3 < IC-12 < IS5 < ICS3 < ICS7 < ICS5, suggesting that the formation of CdIn2S4 contributes to the interfacial charge transfer in ICS HSs, which enhances the separation and transfer efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers.59Fig. 7c shows the EIS results of the samples, in which a smaller arc radius is usually the evidence of a lower electron transfer resistance. The radius of ICS was smaller than that of the other samples and ICS5 exhibited the smallest radius, suggesting that the CdIn2S4 plays a key role in facilitating the transfer of electrons. Fig. 7d shows the Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots of the In2O3, IC-12 and ICS5. All the measured samples displayed a positive slope, indicating the n-type behavior.26,35,59 In addition, the density of charge carriers ND was calculated according to , where e, ε and ε0 are the elementary electron charge, dielectric constant and permittivity in vacuum, respectively, and k is the slope corresponding to the linear portions of the M–S plots.60–62 The calculated carrier density of ICS5 is 1.46 × 1020, which is about 13 times higher than that of In2O3 (1.13 × 1019) and 1.7 times higher than that of IC-12 (8.81 × 1019), leading to the result that the photocurrent intensity of IC-12 is much worse than that of ICS5 (Fig. 7b) although they seemed to share similar PL intensity (Fig. 7a). This high density would further facilitate the transport of charge carriers.35 The results of PL, transient photocurrent response, EIS and M–S plots are mutually corroborated, and in accordance with their photocatalytic H2 production rates, demonstrating that the ternary HS is the dominant factor for the high photocatalytic H2 production rate of ICS5, which effectively promotes the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers.
3.5. Photocatalytic mechanism
Based on the above results, a reasonable photocatalytic mechanism for the photocatalytic H2 evolution over the ICS HSs is proposed. As shown in Scheme 2, there are four contact interfaces formed in the ICS HSs: (1) CdIn2S4–In2O3 interface, (2) In2S3–In2O3 interface, (3) CdIn2S4–In2O3–In2S3 ternary interface and (4) CdIn2S4–In2S3 interface (CdIn2S4 shares almost the same energy band positions with In2S3,20,40,63 so the charge carrier transportation at the CdIn2S4–In2S3 interface is not going to happen. Therefore, we did not draw the CdIn2S4–In2S3 interface in Scheme 2). The positions of the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) for In2O3 are −0.62 and +2.20 eV, respectively, while the positions of the CB and VB for In2S3 are −0.86 and +1.23 eV, respectively.20 Both the VB and CB of In2S3 (CdIn2S4) are more negative than those of In2O3, thus the transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes follows the type-II heterojunction at both the CdIn2S4–In2O3 interface (pathway I, Scheme 2) and the In2S3–In2O3 interface (pathway II, Scheme 2).23,64 As to the CdIn2S4–In2O3–In2S3 ternary interface, the photogenerated electrons at the CB of In2S3 and CdIn2S4 are transferred to the CB of In2O3 and spatially inhibited the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers, the electrons on the CB of In2O3 will then react with water molecules to produce hydrogen. On the other hand, the holes at the VB of In2S3 and CdIn2S4 are captured by the sacrificial agent (pathway III, Scheme 2). The synergistic effects among these multi-interfaces effectively facilitate the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers, promoting the generation of hydrogen.
 Scheme 2  Schematic illustration of the charge-transfer pathways in ICS HSs. 
As shown in Scheme 2 (the left), whether pathway I or pathway II or pathway III, hydrogen is produced at the exposed In2O3 sites through the reaction between the adsorbed water molecules and the photogenerated electrons excited from In2O3 itself or transferred from In2S3 and CdIn2S4. Therefore, the exposed In2O3 sites are very important for the hydrogen evolution, and the formation of ternary HS and the exposed In2O3 sites are a couple of competitive factors. For ICS5, the In2O3 was properly sulfurized to In2S3, endowing In2S3/CdIn2S4/In2O3 ternary HS with the appropriate amount of exposed In2O3 sites on its surface, resulting in the optimal H2 evolution rate (20.04 μmol h−1). After In2O3 was over-sulfurized (ICS7), a mass of In2O3 was transformed to In2S3 and covered the surface of In2S3/CdIn2S4/In2O3 ternary HS, resulting in a great reduction in the number of exposed In2O3 sites, which is detrimental to the H2 production, resulting in a lower H2 evolution rate (13.82 μmol h−1), as illustrated in Scheme 2 (the right).
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we rationally designed and synthesized a novel flower-like In2S3/CdIn2S4/In2O3 ternary HS by an in situ synchronous sulfurization procedure with the utilization of CdS QDs as an intermediate. The obtained ICS ternary HSs presented remarkably enhanced photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution from water splitting, especially ICS5 (sulfurized for 5 h) with the highest H2 evolution rate of 20.04 μmol h−1 (10 mg catalyst was used), which was 26.7 times and 2.6 times higher than that of pure In2O3 (0.75 μmol h−1) and In2S3/In2O3 binary heterostructure (7.88 μmol h−1), respectively. The enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the multiple interfaces formed in the ICS HS including the CdIn2S4–In2O3 interface, In2S3–In2O3 interface, and CdIn2S4–In2O3–In2S3 interface, which construct multiple pathways for the transfer of photogenerated charge carriers, effectively promoting the photocatalytic hydrogen production. This work may provide a promising strategy to develop novel photocatalysts with highly efficient solar-to-fuel conversion by the controllable construction of multiple carrier-transfer pathways.
