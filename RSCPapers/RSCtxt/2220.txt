    , Accepted 7th March 2014First published on 7th March 2014AbstractThe effect of dye coverage of the mesoporous TiO2 electrode on the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells based on the cobalt tris(bipyridine) electrolyte and the D35 dye was studied in detail. The dye coverage was controlled by using a dye bath with different dye concentrations and containing an inert salt, LiClO4, which was found to promote equilibrium conditions in the dye adsorption process. The amount of adsorbed D35 dye on mesoporous TiO2 was reasonably fit using the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, with a binding constant of 55000 M−1. Upon increasing the dye coverage on the TiO2 electrode, the electron lifetime in the dye-sensitized solar cell increased remarkably, demonstrating the blocking behavior of the D35 dye at the TiO2–electrolyte interface. Consequently, the solar cell efficiency increased dramatically with the D35 dye coverage.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have potential as low cost and environmentally friendly photovoltaic devices and are competitive for indoor applications.1,2 A deep understanding of detailed mechanisms at the dye/electrolyte/semiconductor interface is needed for developing new concepts and improving the cell efficiency and stability.2–5 At the interface the dye absorbs photons and injects electrons into the semiconductor; redox mediators in the electrolyte regenerate the dye and transfer positive charge to the counter electrode. There are, however, several recombination processes: electrons in the semiconductor can recombine with oxidized dye molecules or the oxidized form of the redox couple. The complexity is further increased by the presence of various additives and ions in the electrolyte.2,5 Dye aggregation at the semiconductor interface is also a key issue for the solar cell stability and efficiency.6–8 The nature and the structure of the adsorbed dye molecules have effects on the electron recombination kinetics and the accumulated charge in the mesoporous semiconductor.
Dye adsorption on the mesoporous semiconductor has been investigated in several studies.9–19 The kinetics of dye uptake in mesoporous TiO2 was investigated using optical11–15 and other methods.16,17 The effect of different dye loading times and different dye protonation states for ruthenium sensitizers was studied by Nazeeruddin et al.10 The dye loading conditions affect the performance of the DSC, device stability, and reproducibility of device manufacturing.13,19 Chou et al. have studied different dye loading conditions (including different loading times and different dye bath concentrations) of the N3 dye for mesoporous ZnO and TiO2 electrodes, focusing on the solar cell efficiency.19 Evidence for the formation of islands of N719 dye aggregates or multilayer adsorption was found by Ellis-Gibbings et al.18 Recently, we developed a method based on modulated photocurrent measurements to study the dye adsorption process on flat TiO2 electrodes.20
A reliable method to obtain different dye loadings on mesoporous TiO2 is important to assess the blocking behavior of adsorbed dye molecules. Mori and co-workers obtained partial dye coverage on mesoporous TiO2 electrodes by using very dilute dye bath solutions.21 O'Regan et al. criticized this method, as well as the use of short dyeing times to obtain partial coverage in DSCs, and introduced an alternative method consisting of complete dye adsorption, followed by partial desorption of the dye using a weak basic solution.15 In these studies only the I−/I3− redox electrolyte was considered.
Here we propose the investigation of dye coverage in the cobalt electrolyte based DSCs using different methods to obtain partial dye coverage: addition of an inert salt to the dye bath was found to promote equilibrium conditions in the dye adsorption process. The dye coverage can then be controlled by using different dye concentrations. We have studied the effect of dye coverage in the DSC operation in detail using the organic dye D35 ((E)-3-(5-(4-(bis(20,40-dibutoxybiphenyl-4-yl)amino)phenyl)thiophen-2-yl)-2-cyanoacrylic acid).22 UV/Vis spectroscopy, I–V characterization, photo-voltage/photo-current transients, charge extraction, nanosecond laser spectroscopy, photo-induced absorption and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were used to study the effect of dye coverage on device performance.
Experimental
Solar cell fabrication
Fluorine doped tin oxide coated glass (FTO, TEC 15 from Pilkington) was cleaned by ultrasonication in, respectively, a detergent, deionized water, 0.1 M HCl in ethanol, acetone and ethanol, for 30 minutes each, with water rinsing between each step. Substrates were immersed in an aqueous solution of 40 mM TiCl4 for 1 hour at 70 °C, rinsed with water and ethanol and dried under nitrogen gas flow. The TiO2 paste (Dyesol DSL 18 NRD-T, particle size ≈20 nm, porosity = 64%) was screen printed (5 mm × 5 mm area) on the FTO using a 53T screen with a mesh size of 180 microns. After printing, the TiO2 films were kept for 5 minutes in an ethanol atmosphere, and then sintered in air using a furnace (10 minutes at 180 °C, 10 minutes at 320 °C, 10 minutes at 390 °C and 30 minutes at 490 °C; ramp time between each step was 30 min). The thickness of TiO2 films measured using the Dektak3 profilometer was 5.8 μm. Electrodes were then immersed in ethanolic solutions containing different concentrations of the D35 dye (Dyenamo AB, Sweden) or Z907 dye (Dyesol), ranging from 10 μM to 200 μM and containing 0.1 M LiClO4 and kept overnight (for 15 hours). After dye adsorption, electrodes were briefly rinsed using ethanol and dried under vacuum. Counter electrodes were fabricated as follows: FTO with pre-drilled holes were cleaned as mentioned before, sintered at 400 °C for 15 minutes, covered by a droplet of 5 mM ethanolic solution of H2PtCl6 and heated again in 400 °C for 15 minutes. The working and counter electrodes were sealed using a thermoplastic frame (Surlyn, 40 μm thickness). The electrolyte was introduced through the hole of the counter electrode by vacuum backfilling, and the hole was sealed using thermoplastic and a glass slide. The electrolyte consisted of 0.22 M Co(bpy)3(PF6)2, 0.05 M Co(bpy)3(PF6)3, 0.1 M LiClO4 and 0.2 M tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile. For comparison of the cobalt electrolyte with iodide electrolyte based DSCs, test cells were fabricated based on D35 or Z907 dyes using the iodide electrolyte. The iodide electrolyte consisted of 0.03 M I2, 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in a mixture of MeCN:PrCN (85:15% by volume). At least two solar cells were fabricated and characterized for each dye load.
Characterization of DSCs
The current–voltage curves of DSCs were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source/meter under AM 1.5G conditions using a Newport solar simulator (model 91160). A 36 mm2 black square mask was used for current–voltage measurements. The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of the cells was recorded using a xenon light source (Spectral Products ASBXE-175), a monochromator (Spectral Products CM110), and a Keithley 2700 multimeter. Electron lifetime and transport time were measured by recording the transient voltage and current of the cell in response to small amplitude square wave perturbations under working conditions at different light intensities. The light was generated by a white LED and current and voltage were recorded using a lock-in amplifier and acquisition data board attached to a computer. The amount of extracted charge under open circuit and short circuit conditions were measured by biasing the LED light, keeping the cell in the desired working condition for 10 seconds and finally turning the light off and integrating the current versus time for 15 seconds. Electrochemical impedance spectra of solar cells were recorded using an Autolab PST100N instrument. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on an Ocean Optics spectrophotometer (model HR 2000). The amount of adsorbed dye on the surface Γ (in mol cm−2) was calculated from UV-vis spectra from the absorbance A = 1000 × ε × Γ, where ε is the molar extinction coefficient (units M−1 cm−1), see Section S1 of ESI.† Transient absorption measurements on a nanosecond timescale were performed on an Edinburgh Instrument LP920 laser flash photolysis spectrometer using a near-infrared LED (λmax 880 nm) as probe light and an amplified Si photodiode (Thorlabs PDA10A) with a 715 nm cut off filter as the detector (system response time ∼1 μs). Laser pulses were generated using a Continuum Surelight II, Nd:YAG laser at 10 Hz repetition rate in combination with an OPO (Continuum Surelight). The pulse intensity was attenuated to 0.1 mJ cm−2 per pulse. The pump light wavelength was selected so that light absorption was the same in all samples. Kinetic traces were averaged 160 times per sample and at least two samples were measured for each condition. The photoinduced absorption (PIA) setup is described elsewhere.23 Excitation was provided by on/off modulation of a green diode laser (532 nm, Lasermate) at 9.3 Hz.
Results and discussion
The D35 dye loading on mesoporous TiO2 electrodes depends on the concentration of the dye in the dye bath, as is evident from the UV-Vis spectra shown in Fig. 1a. The absorption of the electrodes increased gradually with the dye bath concentration, reaching saturation at a concentration of about 60–70 μM. There are no significant spectral differences for different dye loads on TiO2, suggesting that there is little interaction between the adsorbed dye molecules. Notably, we had added 0.1 M LiClO4 in the dye bath to simulate conditions that are comparable to that of the electrolyte in the dye-sensitized solar cell. Addition of the salt will result in establishment of a dye adsorption–desorption equilibrium, while desorption can be restricted when pure non-protic solvents are used in the dye bath, see Scheme 1. Dyeing the electrodes using pure ethanol as solvent for dye solutions resulted in a quite similar trend to dyeing in the Li salt containing dye solutions, which can be attributed to the fact that ethanol is a protic solvent. The current–voltage characteristics of fabricated cells were, however, slightly different (see Section S5 of ESI†).

 Scheme 1  Dye adsorption onto TiO2 is accompanied by the transfer of a proton to the TiO2 surface. In non-protic solvents, desorption of the dye requires simultaneous desorption of the dye and the proton and is therefore much restricted. Addition of a salt such as LiClO4 to the solvent takes away the requirement of proton desorption for dye desorption. 
A reasonable fit of the data can be obtained using the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, which is the simplest model for the adsorption of molecules on the surface of solids (see Section S1 in ESI†). The binding constant was determined to be 5.5(±1.0) × 104 M−1, in fair agreement with the value we determined by modulated photocurrent measurements on flat TiO2 films (4.2 × 104 M−1).20 Our data suggest the formation of a dye monolayer at the surface of the mesoporous TiO2 electrode, as is usually assumed in dye-sensitized solar cells. From the full D35 coverage on the mesoporous TiO2 electrodes, the area occupied by a single D35 molecule was calculated to be 0.68 nm2 (see ESI† for calculation details).
Solar cell characteristics of DSCs with different dye loadings are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1. Upon increasing the dye bath concentration, the open circuit voltage (VOC), short circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) of the devices increase. Changes in the current density for the lowest concentrations are appreciable, but at higher dye loading the current saturates. Interestingly, JSC does not scale with the amount of absorbed photons, as will be discussed later. The open circuit potential shows an almost step-like increase from low values of about 0.40 V at a relative dye coverage below 85% of maximum coverage to high values of about 0.88 V at coverage higher than 90%. Similarly, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the solar cells shows a nearly step-like function.

IPCE spectra of the DSCs with different dye coverages are shown in Fig. 3a. While the IPCE is high with the maximum around 470 nm for high dye coverage, more than 80%, it drops significantly when the relative dye load is below 90%. This drop cannot be attributed to the decrease in light absorption, as is evident from the calculated absorbed photon to current conversion efficiency (APCE) spectra, as shown in Fig. 3b. APCE is the product of injection, regeneration and charge collection efficiencies. We attribute the drop in APCE to the low charge collection efficiency in devices with lower dye coverage. The clear wavelength dependency of the APCE is attributed to the short electron diffusion length in these devices. Only electrons injected into the mesoporous TiO2 close to the FTO substrate can reach the substrate, while electrons injected further away are lost due to recombination in the electrolyte. We will discuss this issue later.

Fig. 4a shows the electron lifetime recorded under open-circuit conditions for DSCs with different dye coverages. There is an enormous jump in the electron lifetime on going from low to high dye coverage, occurring at about 90% of full dye coverage. We attribute this effect to the remarkable blocking behavior of the D35 dye.24 Apparently, the blocking capability of the dye monolayer breaks down below a relative coverage of about 90%. The capability of certain dyes to retard the recombination of electrons in TiO2 with the oxidized form of the redox couple has been found in iodide-based DSCs,21,25 but is more pronounced in cobalt based DSCs.24,26
 Fig. 4  (a) Electron lifetime and (b) photocurrent response time of DSCs with different dye loads. Dye bath concentrations are indicated. 
The photocurrent response time, recorded under short-circuit conditions, is shown in Fig. 4b. The photocurrent response clearly becomes faster at lower dye coverage. This effect is mainly attributed to the increased recombination in devices with lower dye coverage. The photocurrent response time τpc is related to the electron transport time τtr and the electron lifetime τn as follows: (τpc)−1 = (τtr)−1 + (τn)−1. If the electron lifetime is much higher than transport time at the same Fermi level, then the photocurrent response time is equal to the transport time. At lower dye coverage, however, it appears that significant electron recombination also occurs under short-circuit conditions, as is evident from the APCE spectra (Fig. 3b). This can account for the shorter photocurrent response times. It may be possible that lower dye coverage affects the electron transport time, as it has been shown that different dyes can affect electron transport in mesoporous TiO2 in DSCs.21 Our results, however, do not present conclusive evidence.
Charge extraction measurements were performed on the DSC devices under open circuit and short circuit conditions (see Fig. 5 and Fig. S1 in ESI†). The extracted charge under open circuit conditions (QOC) was very similar for DSC devices with high dye loads, suggesting that there are no significant changes in the conduction band edge position. At lower dye coverage, however, deviating behavior is found. As there will be significant electron recombination during the charge extraction process for cells with low dye coverage, less charge will be extracted. This accounts for the deviating behavior of the DSC in Fig. 5 that was sensitized in a 50 μM dye bath. For the 10, 25 and 35 μM samples, the extracted charge was in the order of 100 times lower than that of the high coverage cells, showing that charge collection efficiency is very low for these solar cells. Under these conditions, QOC does not accurately reflect the accumulated charge in the mesoporous TiO2 electrodes. The extracted charge under short-circuit conditions plotted against JSC was nearly similar for all devices (see Fig. S3 in ESI†). This can be understood from the fact that by using JSC we make some correction for the recombination losses during charge collection.

The results from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis of the DSCs (shown in Fig. S6 and S7, ESI†) are consistent with the above analysis. The recombination resistance is clearly higher for DSCs with higher dye coverage. The trend for the chemical capacitance of the mesoporous electrodes with different dye loads was not completely clear and needs further study. The electron lifetime derived from impedance studies (the product of recombination resistance and chemical capacitance), follows the same trend as in Fig. 4a with increased lifetime for higher dye coverage.

Fig. 6 shows the photoinduced absorption spectra of DSCs with the cobalt electrolyte and with different dye loads. The broad, featureless absorption in the near-infrared region is caused by electrons in TiO2 and demonstrates that there are no or very few oxidized D35 molecules present under near steady-state illumination (at the low modulation frequency of 9.3 Hz). The spectrum of oxidized D35 has a characteristic absorption in the near-IR region (see Fig. S2 in ESI†). This confirms that dye regeneration of the oxidized dye by the cobalt mediator is successful and efficient. The bleach at around 550 nm in Fig. 6 is caused by the Stark effect: upon photoinduced electron injection, there will be a change in the electric field across the adsorbed dye layer.27 The electroabsorption spectrum of D35 (spectrum of a monolayer D35 under the influence of an electric field) is shown in the ESI† (Fig. S3). It is apparent that higher dye loading causes a stronger Stark bleach in the PIA spectrum (Fig. 6), even when the signal is normalized with respect to the electron concentration in the mesoporous TiO2 (see Fig. S4 in ESI†). The bleach intensity is proportional to the electric field across the dye.27 At lower dye coverage the electrons in the TiO2 can be charge compensated by cations close to the semiconductor surface, whereas at high coverage the counter charge resides outside the dense dye monolayer. This can explain the difference in the observed magnitude of the Stark effect.

Nanosecond laser spectroscopy was used to study the photoinduced electron transfer kinetics in more detail. Specifically, the effect of dye coverage on the dye regeneration time in the DSCs was investigated, see Fig. 7. Care was taken to excite the same number of dye molecules in the samples with different dye loads. The dye regeneration time was found to become slightly longer when the dye coverage increased, the halflife changed from 5 μs at lowest dyeload to about 10 μs at full dye load. Multiexponential fit result to the transient absorption data is given in the ESI.† A possible explanation for the observed result is that at low coverage the dye molecules are better accessible to the Co(II) species in the electrolyte.

Finally, some test cells were fabricated using D35 and Z907 dyes with an iodide electrolyte (see Section S6 of ESI†). In the iodide electrolyte, the recombination of electrons with redox mediators is a two electron reaction, with a rate that is usually much lower than in the cobalt electrolyte. As expected, the blocking effect of the D35 and Z907 dyes does not seem to play a role in the iodide-based electrolyte (see Fig. S10 and S11 in ESI†). At high Z907 coverage in fact a decrease in electron lifetime was observed compared to lower coverage. These data are in qualitative agreement with ref. 28 in which higher dye coverage led to slightly higher recombination rates in the DSC based on the iodide electrolyte and the Z907 dye. The higher solar cell efficiencies for higher dye coverages in the iodide-based DSCs are because of higher short circuit current resulting from a higher number of adsorbed dyes. More investigation is needed to reach a generalized statement about the effect of dye coverages for different dyes in different electrolytes.28
Conclusion
The coverage of an adsorbed dye on a mesoporous TiO2 could effectively be controlled using dye baths containing an inert salt, which was found to promote equilibrium conditions in the dye adsorption process. The amount of adsorbed D35 dye on the TiO2 was reasonably fit using the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, and a binding constant of 5.5(±1.0) × 104 M−1 was found.
By increasing the dye coverage, electron recombination is suppressed and better solar cell performance is obtained. More than 90% of full dye coverage is needed for well-performing DSCs with a cobalt-based electrolyte, whereas high coverage is not critical for an iodide-based electrolyte. The Stark effect observed in photoinduced absorption spectra demonstrates that at lower dye coverage the electrons in TiO2 are mostly charge compensated by cations close to the semiconductor surface, whereas at high coverage the counter charge resides outside the dense dye monolayer.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) UV/Vis spectra of DSC working electrodes with different D35 dye coverages. Dye bath concentrations are indicated. (b) Adsorption isotherm for D35 on mesoporous TiO2 films. The red curve is fit to the Langmuir isotherm. Dye bath: D35 + 0.1 M LiClO4 in EtOH.	 

 	Scheme 1  Dye adsorption onto TiO2 is accompanied by the transfer of a proton to the TiO2 surface. In non-protic solvents, desorption of the dye requires simultaneous desorption of the dye and the proton and is therefore much restricted. Addition of a salt such as LiClO4 to the solvent takes away the requirement of proton desorption for dye desorption.	 

 	Fig. 2  Solar cell characteristics of DSCs with a Co(bpy)3-based electrolyte with different D35 dye coverages: (a) efficiency and JSC and (b) VOC and FF.
