    , Accepted 1st June 2017First published on 5th June 2017AbstractEffective control of the interface between the metal cathode and the electron transport layer (ETL) is critical for achieving high performance p–i–n planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Several organic molecules have been explored as interlayers between the silver (Ag) electrode and the ETL for the improvement in the photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) of p–i–n planar PSCs. However, the role of these organic molecules in the charge transfer at the metal/ETL interface and the chemical degradation processes of PSCs has not yet been fully understood. In this work, we systematically explore the effects of the interfacial modification of the Ag/ETL interface on PSCs using rhodamine 101 as a model molecule. By the insertion of rhodamine 101 as an interlayer between Ag and fullerene derivatives (PC60BM and PC70BM) ETLs improve the PCE as well as the stability of p–i–n planar PSCs. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) characterization reveals that rhodamine passivates the defects at the PCBM layer and reduces the band bending at the PCBM surface. In consequence, charge transfer from the PCBM towards the Ag electrode is enhanced leading to an increased fill factor (FF) resulting in a PCE up to 16.6%. Moreover, rhodamine acts as a permeation barrier hindering the penetration of moisture towards the perovskite layer as well as preventing the chemical interaction of perovskite with the Ag electrode. Interestingly, the work function of the metal cathode remains more stable due to the rhodamine incorporation. Consequently, a better alignment between the quasi-Fermi level of PCBM and the Ag work function is achieved minimizing the energy barrier for charge extraction. This work contributes to reveal the relevance of proper interfacial engineering at the metal-cathode/organic-semiconductor interface.
Introduction
Perovskite solar technology has experienced an impressive advancement reaching an efficiency over 22%1 in just a few years after the breakthrough reports on perovskite-sensitized solar cells in 20092 and long-term stable solid-state perovskite solar cells in 2012.3 Among many strategies, interface engineering has the potential to lead simultaneously to highly efficient and long-lasting devices.4–6 In fact, Yang et al.7 demonstrated that controlling the surface recombination at the top and bottom interfaces of the perovskite gives more relevant results than controlling the corresponding recombination in bulk and grain boundaries for obtaining high performance devices. One of the most studied ETLs in p–i–n planar perovskite solar cells (PSC) is PCBM.8–13 This molecule has suitable properties as an electron transport layer (ETL) such as good electron mobility, proper energy alignment with the conduction band level of the perovskite and orthogonal-solvent processability enabling the PCBM film formation on the top of the perovskite layer.11,14–16 However, several reports show that p–i–n PSCs with a single PCBM layer as the ETL exhibit poor photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) indicating the necessity of additional ETLs.10,14,17 The poor performance of single layer PCBM has been attributed to the ineffective control of the properties at the metal-cathode/organic-semiconductor interface.18 For instance, metals of high work function (WF), such as aluminum or silver, present high energy mismatch with the quasi-Fermi level of PCBM resulting in poor device performance.18 Although low WF metals such as calcium (Ca) form good contact with organic semiconductors, its instability under environmental conditions hampers its practical application. In general, the optimized ETL is composed of a multilayer stack where each material has a specific function.16,19–23These interlayers must adjust the WF of the cathode to improve its contact with PCBM and must possess solvent orthogonality to allow film formation atop the PCBM layer. With this objective, several authors have explored different molecules such as rhodamine,24,25 C60,6,20 lithium fluoride,6,16 bathocuproine,26 alcohol soluble titanium chelate TIPD (titanium (diisopropoxide) bis(2,4-pentanedionate))27 and fullerene derivatives.6,28,29 Moreover, even polymer isolators have been incorporated as part of the device structure intended for creating physical barriers against ambient degradation.21,30 In particular, rhodamine 101 possesses an intrinsic dipole moment and does not diffuse under an electric field enabling a broad tuning of the work function in metals and also in transparent conductive oxides.19,25,31 In addition, its processability in anhydrous alcohols makes it compatible with PCBM. As a result, 13.2% (ref. 25) efficiency in p–i–n PSCs has been demonstrated. However, the physical mechanism behind the improvement associated with the rhodamine incorporation has not yet been fully proven.
In this work, we demonstrate the twofold role of rhodamine in enhancing the PCE and operational stability in p–i–n planar PSCs. As demonstrated by a surface photovoltage analysis, rhodamine reduces trap states and also the band bending at the PCBM surface leading to a high fill factor. Additionally, XRD analysis and temporal evolution of the work function reveal that rhodamine hinders the access of ambient moisture to the perovskite layer simultaneously preventing ion migration from the perovskite. In consequence, the formation of silver halides is blocked resulting in enhanced operational stability.
Experimental
Device fabrication
Devices were fabricated on ITO coated glass (Naranjo). The substrates were washed with neutral soap and sequentially sonicated in DI water, acetone and isopropanol. Then, they were treated with ultraviolet ozone for 10 min. The hole transporting layer was fabricated by spin-coating a NiOx dispersion as reported elsewhere.29 In a typical procedure, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (1.4 g, Merck) was dispersed in 1 mL deionized water to obtain a dark green solution. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 10 by adding a NaOH solution (10 M, Sigma Aldrich). The colloidal precipitated was thoroughly washed with deionized water twice, and dried at 80 °C for 12 h. The obtained green powder was then annealed at different temperatures for 3 h to obtain a dark-black powder. The NPs were dispersed in deionized (DI) water to a 20 mg mL−1 concentration and deposited via spin-coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The resulting 20 nm thick NiOx layer exhibited a smooth surface as shown in Fig. S1.† The perovskite layer was then deposited from a 51 wt% precursor solution of MAI:PbI2:DMSO adduct. 461 mg of PbI2 (Alfa Aesar), 159.0 mg of MAI (Dyesol) and 78 mg of DMSO (>99.5%, Sigma) were mixed in 528.6 mg of DMF (anhydrous, 99.8% Sigma-Aldrich) and stirred at room temperature for 30 min before use. The precursor solution was spin-coated on the NiOx at 4000 rpm for 25 s. During spinning, 500 μL of diethylether (Aldrich) were dripped on the substrate after 10 seconds.32 The films were then annealed at 65 °C for 1 min plus 100 °C for 30 min. PC70BM and PC60BM (1-Material) were deposited via spin-coating a 20 mg mL−1 solution in chlorobenzene (CB) at 2000 rpm for 30 s. The rhodamine 101 (1-Material) interlayer was deposited via spin-coating a 0.5 mg mL−1 solution in anhydrous isopropanol (Aldrich) at 4000 rpm for 25 s. Finally, to complete the devices, 100 nm silver electrodes were thermally evaporated under vacuum (≈10−6 mbar) at a deposition rate of around ≈0.1 nm s−1.
Device characterization
The electrical characterization of the devices was performed using a 4200SCS Keithley system at a voltage sweep speed of around 400 mV s−1 in combination with an Oriel Sol3A sun simulator, which was calibrated to the AM1.5G standard conditions using an Oriel 91150 V reference cell. An Oriel IQE 200 was used to determine the external quantum efficiency. Stability study measurements were performed on un-encapsulated devices, stored in a box at 50 ± 5% RH and 23 °C for 1000 h. The surface roughness and thickness of the different layers were obtained using a Bruker DektakXT profilometer. Surface potential and surface photovoltage (SPV) measurements were performed by employing an MFP-3D AFM (Asylum Research) using the dual-pass technique.33 The tips used were silicon Ti–Ir coated (Asyelec-01) with a nominal spring constant of 2.89 N m−1 and a resonance frequency of 71.7 kHz. The scan size was 5 μm at a scan rate of 0.5 Hz. For the measurement of the electrode work function (WF) the tip was calibrated using a gold surface (WF = 5.1 eV). The surface potential was measured at different light intensities in order to obtain the induced surface photovoltage (SPV) defined as the difference between the surface potential under illumination (potentialLIGHT) and the surface potential in the dark (potentialDARK). All measurements were carried out at 23 °C and relative humidity below 20%. An X-ray diffractogram was recorded for the prepared thin film in a PANalytical diffractometer scanned from 2θ = 5° to 60° in a Bragg–Brentano geometry, using Cu Kα (1.5408 Å) radiation with a step size of 0.04° and a speed of 2° per minute.
Results and discussion
The ETL/metal interface of a p–i–n planar PSC was effectively engineered by incorporating rhodamine 101 in the basic device structure. We fabricated p–i–n planar PSCs using NiOx as a hole-transporting layer, PC60BM or PC70BM as an electron-transporting layer and rhodamine as an interlayer between the silver (Ag) and the PCBM as shown in Fig. 1a. Initially, the HOMO and LUMO levels of rhodamine were estimated using cyclic voltammetry as shown in Fig. 1b, Fig. S2 and Table S1.† Moreover, the modification of the WF of the metal electrode produced by the rhodamine layer was measured by Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM). It was found that rhodamine decreases the WF of silver by around 0.18 eV as shown in Table S2.† Accordingly, rhodamine is expected to reduce the 0.6 eV energy mismatch between PCBM and the silver cathode (Fig. 1b) consequently enhancing the quality of the interfacial contact and the electron collection. Solar cells with the rhodamine interlayer showed a remarkable improvement of all photovoltaic parameters, especially the fill factor (FF) from 73.03% to 76.16% for PC70BM and from 65.73% to 73.18% for PC60BM, with respect to the devices without it as presented in Fig. 1c. The enhancement of FF is mainly derived from the reduction of the series resistance (Rs) in the devices with rhodamine as shown in Fig. S3.† Due to the insulating character of the rhodamine layer an optimal thickness of around ≈2 nm was found because higher thickness produced lower Jsc, higher Rs, and consequently lower PCE as shown in Fig. S4.† In order to isolate the effect of rhodamine, the device labelled as ‘0 nm’ in Fig. S4† was processed using pure anhydrous isopropyl alcohol evidencing that rhodamine indeed is the material improving the device performance and not just the alcohol treatment. Interestingly, the PSCs based on bilayer PC70BM/rhodamine exhibited better performance than the ones based on PC60BM/rhodamine (Table 1 and Fig. S5†). The champion device reached a 16.6% stabilized power output clearly outperforming the previous 13.2% record achieved using rhodamine.25

Besides exhibiting an enhanced PCE, the PC70BM/rhodamine-based devices also attained longer device operational stability. We measured the stabilized power output (SPO) for un-encapsulated devices left under ambient conditions for 1000 h as shown in Fig. 2a. In general, the samples with rhodamine interlayers were more stable than those without them. In addition, we found a more stable WF of the silver electrode using the PC70BM/rhodamine bilayer as shown in Fig. 2b. As reported elsewhere,18,34 the diffusion of iodide ions through silver leads to the formation of AgI which we presume is partially responsible for the variations in the WF of silver. Nevertheless, this effect is reduced in the PC70BM/rhodamine-based devices, which helps in maintaining a good energy band alignment between PCBM and Ag. Accordingly, rhodamine is expected to act as a protective layer reducing the migration of iodide into silver. In order to support this hypothesis, we carried out X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis for the complete devices as a function of time. XRD diffractograms and peak assignment are presented in Fig. S6.† Some XRD peaks appeared after several days indicating the formation of decomposition byproducts such as hydrated perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3·H2O), silver iodide (AgI) and lead iodide (PbI2). The XRD peak intensity ratio between these products and their initial precursors is shown in Fig. 2c. As hypothesized, the rhodamine layer suppressed the formation of AgI when combined with both PC60BM and PC70BM. This layer also limited the formation of PbI2 and hydrated perovskite when combined with PC70BM confirming the relevant role of the rhodamine interlayer in preventing the chemical degradation of the perovskite devices.

A careful analysis of the topography and surface potential allowed us to determine the central role of rhodamine in passivating defects in the PCBM–silver interface. Topography analysis (Fig. 3, Fig. S7 and S8†) shows that the perovskite film is composed of large grains of about 270 nm with clearly delimited boundaries and large height fluctuations (roughness = 9.1 nm). Similarly, PCBM layers are formed by well-connected grains of about 220 nm with low height fluctuations (roughness = 2.4 nm). Both PC70BM and PC60BM layers exhibit densely packed grains with no distinguishable boundaries and a low roughness remaining almost unmodified upon the addition of rhodamine. On the other hand, the surface potential at the grain boundaries of the perovskite layer shows high fluctuations as shown in Fig. 3d. These fluctuations are related to free charges or under-coordinated chemical bonds at the semiconductor surface acting as charge trapping states. Therefore, the perovskite layer exhibits a high density of surface trap states potentially leading to non-radiative recombination centers. In the same way, the PC60BM and PC70BM films (Fig. 3e and Fig. S7e†) present important variations in the surface potential along the entire layer. Interestingly, the rhodamine inclusion represented a strong reduction in the variation of the surface potential as evidenced in Fig. 3f and Fig. S9.† Since the spatial uniformity of the surface potential can be associated with the passivation of defects in organic semiconductors,35,36 the rhodamine interlayer induces a lower accumulation of defects right before the metal cathode enhancing the charge transfer. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements (Fig. S10†) show that rhodamine does not affect the PL emission intensity of perovskite/PCBM layers. Therefore, rhodamine has no effect on the radiative recombination of the perovskite. Thus, the improvement in the charge transfer should be attributed to the lower accumulation of defects as discussed before.

In order to further reveal the mechanism behind the simultaneous enhancement of the device performance and temporal stability by including the rhodamine interlayer, we demonstrate that rhodamine reduces the surface traps in the PCBM surface and attenuates the formation of energy barriers leading to a better electron transfer towards the silver cathode. As reported previously,37,38 the sign of the SPV represents the direction of the surface band bending and its magnitude represents the density of surface trap states. Fig. 4a shows that the SPV of the PC70BM layer is negative irrespective of the addition of rhodamine. This negative SPV value means that the bands of PC70BM bend upward in all cases. Therefore, at the PCBM surface there are acceptor states which can trap electrons leaving behind a depletion region, as shown schematically in Fig. 4b. While rhodamine has no influence on the sign of the SPV, it decreases its magnitude by around 100 mV.

(a) Dependence of the surface photo-voltage (SPV) on the light intensity for PC70BM films grown on ITO/NiOx/CH3NH3PbI3 with and without rhodamine. (b) Schematic of the surface band bending in the space charge region (SCR) of the PC70BM semiconductor with or without rhodamine. (c) Schematic of the PC70BM/Ag junction, representing Fermi level pinning and surface band bending at the organic semiconductor depending on the WF of silver. Progressively, the device degradation induces an increase of the silver WF which is attenuated by including the rhodamine layer. 
Accordingly, the lower magnitude of the SPV confirms a smaller density of surface trap states induced by the rhodamine. As a result, there is a reduction in the degree of depletion leading to a flattening of the bands at the PC70BM surface (Fig. 4b). Since upward band bending within the PC70BM layer constitutes an electrostatic barrier for the electron transfer across the PCBM/Ag interface, clearly the rhodamine interlayer enhances the electron transfer from PCBM to silver explaining the better PCE and FF obtained as presented in Fig. 1c. On the other hand, as explained previously, the insertion of the rhodamine interlayer also enabled more stable devices in time (Fig. 2a). In order to explain this finding, we propose the following mechanism. When silver and PC70BM are brought into electronic contact their Fermi levels must line up, as depicted in Fig. 4c. Consequently, the vacuum levels change building a potential ΔEvac equivalent to the differences in the WF of the metal and the n-type semiconductor.39 The magnitude of this ΔEvac is related to the degree of band bending within the organic semiconductor at the interface. An increase of the silver WF implies a higher value of ΔEvac leading to a higher degree of band bending at the surface of the PC70BM and the aforementioned electrostatic barrier for electron transfer, as shown schematically in Fig. 4c. In our case, devices with rhodamine indeed exhibited a lower variation of the silver WF over time suggesting an attenuation of the progressive creation of a barrier to the transfer of electrons from PCBM to the silver cathode. Accordingly, the rhodamine-based devices outperformed the devices not including this interlayer.
Conclusions
We have elucidated the role of the rhodamine interfacial layer in the enhancement of the PCE and operational stability of p–i–n planar PSCs. Through XRD analysis, we found that the rhodamine interlayer acts as a blocking barrier inhibiting the ingress of moisture towards the perovskite and simultaneously preventing the migration of iodide that potentially could react with the silver cathode. On the other hand, AFM characterization allowed us to explain the effect of rhodamine on the improvement of the photovoltaic parameters of PSCs. Although rhodamine has little impact on the topography of the PCBM layer, it induces an important change in its surface electronic properties. Surface potential measurements demonstrate that rhodamine passivates surface trap states leading to reduced non-radiative recombination. Moreover, the surface photovoltage under illumination shows that rhodamine flattens the PCBM bands leading to enhanced charge transfer toward the metal cathode due to the reduced electrostatic barrier. Accordingly, p–i–n planar PSCs including rhodamine achieved the highest reported PCE up to 16.8%, for this type of architecture with enhanced stability. This work contributes to a better understanding of the operational mechanisms of PSCs, specifically about the pivotal role of proper interfacial engineering at the metal-cathode/organic-semiconductor interface.

 	Fig. 3  (a–c) Topography and (d–f) surface potential maps of (a, d) perovskite layer on NiOx, (b, e) PC70BM layer on perovskite and (c, f) PC70BM/rhodamine layer on perovskite. The electronic effect of rhodamine in stabilizing the surface potential is apparent.	 

 	Fig. 4  Effect of the rhodamine interlayer on the surface electronic properties of the PC70BM semiconductor. (a) Dependence of the surface photo-voltage (SPV) on the light intensity for PC70BM films grown on ITO/NiOx/CH3NH3PbI3 with and without rhodamine. (b) Schematic of the surface band bending in the space charge region (SCR) of the PC70BM semiconductor with or without rhodamine. (c) Schematic of the PC70BM/Ag junction, representing Fermi level pinning and surface band bending at the organic semiconductor depending on the WF of silver. Progressively, the device degradation induces an increase of the silver WF which is attenuated by including the rhodamine layer.
