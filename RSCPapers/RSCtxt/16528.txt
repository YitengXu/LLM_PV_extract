    , Accepted 29th May 2018First published on 29th May 2018AbstractThis communication describes an efficient co-catalyst Co3O4 nanoparticle with a tunable two-electron water oxidation reaction pathway in photoelectrochemical H2O2 production. The photoluminescence measurement explains that the promotion effect is due to the accelerated activation of water to ˙OH. The increased Faraday efficiency of H2O2 for the Co3O4/WO3 sample also verifies that the promotion effect to a two-electron water oxidation reaction of Co3O4 is universal to other semiconductor photoanodes.
Direct conversion of solar energy into easily storable chemical energy has attracted much attention as the key technology to ensure a stable supply of energy because the amount of electric energy, generated by photovoltaic cells, depends directly on intermittent solar energy.1–3 In this context, hydrogen (H2) has been long regarded as a promising chemical energy carrier producible by the utilization of solar energy.4 Extensive efforts have been devoted to achieving photochemical water splitting with semiconductor photocatalysts for the efficient utilization of solar energy.5 Photoelectrode systems are widely recognized as a promising technology for H2 production. As shown in eqn (1) and (2), water splitting using photoelectrodes, which are composed of n-type semiconductors, produces O2 on the photoanode and H2 on the counter electrode at the cathode.6 However, most previous investigations focused solely on the recovery of H2 energy, and little attention has been paid to the recovery of the oxidation products evolved simultaneously during water splitting. 2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e−: E(O2/H2O) = +1.23 V vs. RHE(1) 2H+ + 2e− → H2: E(H+/H2) = 0 V vs. RHE(2)
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a liquid at ambient temperature and pressure and thereby has high energy density per unit volume without the use of a high-pressure tank. In addition to being a versatile and clean redox agent for selective organic conversion, environmental purification, bleaching, etc., H2O2 could also provide electrical energy through H2O2 fuel cells with a theoretical output voltage of 1.09 V by utilizing H2O2 as both a reductant on the cathode and an oxidant on the anode, emitting only water and oxygen after power generation.7–10 At present, the most attractive research on H2O2 production is to find efficient electrocatalysts for the direct production of H2O2 in a process that is cleaner and more sustainable than the industrial anthraquinone process.11,12 Direct synthesis of H2O2 from H2 and O2 has been studied extensively in order to reduce the possibility of explosion and simultaneously find selective and active catalysts. The O2 reduction reaction that produces H2O2 is shown in eqn (3). O2 + 2H+ + 2e− → H2O2: E(O2/H2O2) = +0.68 V vs. RHE(3)
Compared with the direct synthesis and O2 reduction method, the oxidation of water to H2O2 is a more facile process, which only requires water as the reactant and directly produces H2O2, with value added H2 as the other product. The water oxidation reaction generating H2O2 is shown in eqn (4). 2H2O → H2O2 + 2H+ + 2e−: E(H2O2/H2O) = +1.77 V vs. RHE(4)
Unfortunately, it has been proven difficult to find efficient catalysts for this reaction. To the best of our knowledge, rare research has been focused on H2O2 formation by photoelectrochemical (PEC) oxidation reactions at photoanodes. Fuku and Sayama found that the amount of generated H2O2 was remarkably increased when the KHCO3 solution was used as the electrolyte, where HCO3− acted as an oxidation catalyst for H2O2 production from H2O by transferring the photogenerated holes to the surface of the photoanode.13 Our previous investigation proved that Co3O4 could act as an efficient co-catalyst to accelerate the water oxidation reaction to form H2O2.14 Unfortunately, carbon nanodots can decompose H2O2 rapidly. Co-catalysts that can improve the two-electron oxidation reaction with H2O2 as the target production in the PEC process have not yet been studied.
This communication describes the design and synthesis of a Co3O4/TiO2 photoanode by a facile dip-coating method, which exhibits a significant promotional effect for the production of H2O2 under simulated AM 1.5G illumination (details in the ESI†). In this work, the considerable generation of H2O2 is attributed to the two-electron oxidation reaction enabled by the Co3O4 co-catalyst. Furthermore, photoluminescence (PL) study on ˙OH radicals reveals that the accelerated two-electron reaction is due to the markedly promoted activation of water molecules (H2O → ˙OH). Meanwhile, Co3O4 nanoparticles also promote the Faraday efficiency (η) of H2O2 production for WO3 nanoflake photoanodes, suggesting the universal promotional effect of Co3O4 for two-electron water oxidation.
The SEM (scanning electron microscopy) images (Fig. 1) of pure TiO2, 2 wt% Co3O4/TiO2, and 7.5 wt% Co3O4/TiO2 photoanodes are obtained. Fig. 1a and b show that TiO2 NRs are grown directly on FTO substrates.15 Co3O4 nanoparticles on Co3O4/TiO2 with loading weights of 0.12, 0.25, and 0.5 wt% could hardly be observed (SEM images not shown) when the loading weight is low. With increasing Co3O4 loading (2 to 7.5 wt%), more nanoparticles could be seen on the surface of TiO2 NRs (Fig. 1c and d). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra collected from TiO2 NRs and 7.5 wt% Co3O4/TiO2 NR samples confirmed that TiO2 exhibits a rutile phase and the (111) plane of loaded Co3O4 nanoparticles can be observed (Fig. 2a). The lattice fringes of 0.479 nm corresponding to the (111) facet of Co3O4 are clearly observed from the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image, which indicates the strong attachment of Co3O4 nanoparticles on TiO2 nanorods (Fig. 2c and d).

Light absorption upon loading Co3O4 nanoparticles was investigated with UV-visible diffusive reflectance spectra (Fig. 2b) for TiO2 NRs and Co3O4/TiO2 with various loading weights (0.12, 0.25, 0.5, 2, 3.75, and 7.5 wt%). The spectra of TiO2 NRs show that they mainly absorb in the UV range (wavelength below 410 nm) due to their large band gap (rutile TiO2 ∼ 3.0 eV). Upon loading Co3O4 nanoparticles, the Co3O4/TiO2 NRs show enhanced absorption of visible light (400–600 nm), which is caused by the small band gap of Co3O4 (∼2.1 eV). Meanwhile, with the increasing loading of Co3O4, the intensity of visible light absorption was strengthened. In theory, the deposition of Co3O4 nanoparticles can promote light absorption in the visible region and improve the PEC performance of TiO2 NRs. However, compared with the subsequent photoactivity test, the obstructing effect for the light absorption of bulk TiO2 NRs is also an important factor.

Fig. 3a shows the photocurrent density–potential (J–V) characteristics of TiO2 and Co3O4/TiO2 NRs with various loading amounts (0.12, 0.25, 0.5, 2, 3.75, and 7.5 wt%). A comparison of J–V curves indicates that the photocurrent of Co3O4/TiO2 samples is not higher than pure TiO2 although the light absorption is enhanced upon loading Co3O4.16 One may expect that the photocurrent of Co3O4/TiO2 samples should be larger than that of bare TiO2 NRs due to the catalytic effect of Co3O4 that accelerates surface kinetics of TiO2 NRs. However, because the Co3O4 nanoparticles obstruct the light absorption of bulk TiO2 NRs, the PEC performances of Co3O4/TiO2 samples show a certain level of decrease. Co3O4/TiO2 with 0.25 wt% loading exhibits a water oxidation photocurrent of 0.78 ± 0.03 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE (Fig. 3b), which means that the Co3O4 loading of 0.25 wt% enables the catalytic effect of Co3O4 nanoparticles to outperform the negative effect of additional light absorption.

To further confirm the role of Co3O4 nanoparticles on the photoanodes in PEC H2O2 generation reaction, the H2O2 production rates of all samples were obtained in a 0.5 M KHCO3 aqueous electrolyte (pH 7.6) under AM 1.5G at 1.23 V vs. RHE (Fig. 3c and details in the ESI†). The H2O2 evolution of pristine TiO2 NRs is only about 1.90 ± 0.43 μmol cm−2 in three hours. Upon loading Co3O4 nanoparticles, the Co3O4/TiO2 sample shows dramatically enhanced H2O2 production rate. The H2O2 evolution rate exhibits a volcano-shaped trend with increasing loading. The Co3O4/TiO2 sample with 0.25 wt% loading shows the highest activity, which agrees with the J–V characteristics. Meanwhile, after constant potential measurement, no obvious decrease of the photocurrent for the Co3O4/TiO2 sample is observed (Fig. S1, ESI†), and the composition and morphology before and after the test remain unchanged (Fig. S2 and Table S1, ESI†). According to the photocurrent and H2O2 evolution rate, the calculated η(H2O2) also presents a volcanic trend (Fig. 3d). Meanwhile, the highest η(H2O2) of the 0.25 wt% Co3O4/TiO2 sample is about 26.76 ± 1.49%, which is comparable with other reported η(H2O2) by the PEC water oxidation method.13 But it is worth noting that the η(H2O2) of Co3O4/TiO2 samples is five times that of pure TiO2 NR samples. At this point, it can be seen that the loading of Co3O4 on TiO2 NRs can effectively promote the conversion of water to H2O2. In addition, the evolution rate of gaseous O2 and H2 was obtained (Fig. 3e), which was used to calculate the Faradaic efficiencies (denoted as η, Fig. 3f). This result indicates that the sum of η(O2) and η(H2O2) is above 98%, confirming the accuracy in our H2O2 concentration measurement.
In order to explain the catalytic mechanism of Co3O4 nanoparticles during PEC H2O2 production, the change in intermediate species was investigated. For a two-electron water oxidation reaction, the widely accepted reaction path is as follows:17 2H2O (l) + ˙ → ˙OH + H2O (l) + H+ + e−(5) ˙OH + H2O (l) + H+ + e− → H2O2 (l) + 2H+ + 2e−(6)
As for a four-electron water oxidation reaction, the reaction path is as follows:18 2H2O (l) + ˙ → ˙OH + H2O (l) + H+ + e−(7) ˙OH + H2O (l) + H+ + e− → ˙O + H2O (l) + 2H+ + 2e−(8) ˙O + H2O (l) + 2H+ + 2e− → ˙OOH + 3H+ + 3e−(9) ˙OOH + 3H+ + 3e− → O2 (g) + 4H+ + 4e− + ˙(10)
It can be seen that it is difficult to monitor the change in intermediate species during the four-electron reaction of water oxidation because these intermediates can not be detected directly and quantificationally. However, for the two-electron reaction, if the hydroxyl radical (˙OH) can be quantitatively analysed, it can be easily identified which reaction path (eqn (5) or (6)) is mainly promoted.
Here, a fluorescence probe method was used to explore the formation of ˙OH with coumarin (Fig. S3, ESI†).19 Although terephthalic acid was used as the probe molecule in many previous reports, a coumarin molecule is adopted in this study because it contains no charge in the chemical structure and the product molecule (umbelliferone) is commonly available.20,21 Coumarin was already employed as the ˙OH probe in the reaction of polymer electrolyte fuel cells.

Fig. 4a shows the PL spectra of electrolytes used for pristine TiO2 NRs and 0.25 wt% Co3O4/TiO2 samples during a 5 min water oxidation reaction under AM 1.5G irradiation at 1.23 V vs. RHE. The peaks at 400 and 500 nm in PL spectra correspond to coumarin and umbelliferone, respectively. After loading the Co3O4 nanoparticles on TiO2 NRs, the PL intensity of umbelliferone is significantly enhanced. This suggests that the Co3O4/TiO2 sample generates a larger amount of ˙OH than the bare TiO2 sample over the same reaction time. According to the reported standard curve of umbelliferone with different concentrations in a 0.1 mM coumarin solution, the amount of ˙OH on TiO2 and Co3O4/TiO2 samples is about 230.4 and 52.5 nmol, respectively, after a 5 min reaction. Comparing the ratio of the H2O2 evolution rate (6.17) and the ratio of ˙OH (4.39) for both TiO2 and Co3O4/TiO2 samples, it can be assumed that the main effect of Co3O4 nanoparticles in the two-electron water oxidation reaction is to accelerate the activation reaction of water to ˙OH (Fig. 4b). Based on the above analysis, the promotional effect of Co3O4 co-catalysts for the two-electron water oxidation reaction can be proven by our experiments, where the impact on the reaction path can be partially explained using PL data.

In order to verify the universality of Co3O4 over other semiconductor photoanodes for H2O2 production, we synthesized Co3O4/WO3 photoanodes by loading Co3O4 nanoparticles on WO3 nanoflakes (details in the ESI†). The WO3 nanoflake arrays were synthesized on FTO substrates by a modified hydrothermal method reported previously.22 After loading Co3O4 by dip-coating followed by annealing at 500 °C, nanoparticles with a medium coverage can be observed on the surface of WO3 nanoflakes. Unlike TiO2 NRs, the photocurrent of Co3O4/WO3 photoelectrodes is considerably higher than that of pure WO3 nanoflakes upon loading Co3O4 (Fig. S4, ESI†), where the onset potential of the Co3O4/WO3 sample exhibits a markedly cathodic shift of 0.1 V due to the co-catalytic effect of Co3O4 nanoparticles. This suggests that the slow surface reaction kinetics is the major obstacle for WO3. The calculated η(H2O2) of the Co3O4/WO3 sample also shows dramatic enhancement compared with the pure WO3 nanoflake sample (Fig. S5, ESI†), indicating that the Co3O4 nanoparticles can act as efficient co-catalysts to promote the two-electron water oxidation reaction from H2O to H2O2 and this co-catalysis effect is universal for many semiconductor photoanodes.
In summary, our work has demonstrated that Co3O4 nanoparticles can be used as an efficient co-catalyst to improve the two-electron water oxidation reaction from H2O to H2O2 on TiO2 nanorods as photoanodes for PEC H2O2 production. The 0.25 wt% Co3O4/TiO2 photoanode exhibits the optimal Faraday efficiency to H2O2 (about 26.76 ± 1.49%) under AM 1.5G irradiation at 1.23 V vs. RHE which is lower than the theoretical electrolysis voltage of H2O2 from water oxidation (1.77 V vs. RHE). The PL measurements explain that the promotion to the two-electron water oxidation reaction of the Co3O4 co-catalyst is due to acceleration of the first activation reaction of water to ˙OH. Meanwhile, we synthesize Co3O4/WO3 nanoflake photoanodes by the same dip-coating method as that used to synthesize Co3O4/TiO2 NRs. The increased η(H2O2) of the Co3O4/WO3 sample also verifies the co-catalysis effect of Co3O4 nanoparticles and proves that the promotion effect to the two-electron water oxidation reaction of Co3O4 is universal to other semiconductor photoanodes. This study focuses on promoting the transformation of a free reactant (H2O) to a clean and high value-added redox product (H2O2) by adding co-catalysts. But one point that is not negligible is that the generated H2O2 has been constantly decomposed during the reaction process. If this problem can be solved by some methods, the yield and Faraday efficiency of H2O2 can be further enhanced. The construction of a rational design photoanode combining promoting the two-electron water oxidation reaction and inhibiting the decomposition reaction is currently under study.
