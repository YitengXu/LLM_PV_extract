    , Accepted 4th February 2019First published on 4th February 2019AbstractThe extraordinary thermal stability of [NH2CHNH2]3Bi2I9 (FA3Bi2I9) crystals, up to around 600 K, has been enhanced by using the evaporating method. DSC measurements have revealed reversible structural phase transitions: at 203 K (Phase I → Phase II), 173 K (II → III), 134.7 K (III → IV), 131.4 K (IV → V), and 120 K (V → VI). The crystal structures of FA3Bi2I9 adopt the polar space groups P63mc at 220 K (Phase I) and Cmc21 at 190 K (Phase II). The pyroelectric current (Ipyr) measured in the temperature range covering all the phases of FA3Bi2I9 confirmed their polar nature. The reversibility of the spontaneous polarization in each phase has been confirmed by the observed hysteresis loops. All the phase transitions are dielectrically active. The dielectric response (ε*(ω,T) close to 134.7 and 131.4 K) is characteristic of ferroelectrics with a critical slowing-down process. Optical bandgaps estimated from the UV-vis measurements and calculated using the DFT method are equal to 1.85 and 1.89 eV, respectively. On the basis of the structural, dielectric, and spectroscopic results, the molecular mechanisms of the phase transitions have been proposed.
Introduction
Novel materials suitable for use in high-efficiency photovoltaic cells have garnered the interest of many leading laboratories. The desired material should fulfill many requirements, namely, an appropriate bandgap and current carrier concentration. Moreover, it should be stable in the ambient atmosphere without any obvious degradation over thousands of hours of use under standard illumination and humidity conditions. Further, it is desirable that the electron acceptor and donor energy levels are compatible with standard n and p organic semiconductors, commercially available and usually applied in solar cells.
Several methods are, therefore, necessary to estimate the usefulness of such materials for application in photovoltaic devices. The measurements of electric conductivity as well as ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) and photoluminescence are required. Understanding the crystal structure and electronic density of states in the band structure are crucial in the determination of possible direct or indirect electron transitions and other semiconductor properties of the material.
Molecular ionic crystals designed to exhibit order–disorder phenomena have gained immense interest both from the technological and fundamental standpoints. The effect of different organic molecules, incorporated into the crystal structure, on the underlying structure and phase transitions (PTs) is well known for the FABX3-type family (where FA = CH(NH2)2; B = Pb or Sn; X = I).1–4 These materials exhibit promising efficiency toward the conversion of solar light into electrical energy, although their stability is considerably insufficient for practical use.
In the search for novel materials, which may face competition from organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites based on lead, we focus our attention on halobismuthate(III) and haloantimonate(III) compounds. They are described by the general formula RaMbX3b+a, (where R denotes organic cations; M stands for Sb(III) or Bi(III); and X = Cl, Br, or I). They exhibit a rich diversity of anionic structures (from zero- to one-, two-, or even three-dimensional (0D, 1D, 2D, or 3D, respectively) architectures) and isoelectronicity with Sn(II) and Pb(II).5–9 Their ferroelectric properties were found in four subclasses, i.e., RMX4, R3M2X9, R2MX5, and R5M2X11.10–15 Recently, several reports have focused on compounds with the R3M2X9 stoichiometry, which can crystallize either as infinite 1D double chains,16 2D layers,6 discrete bi-octahedral (0D),17 or four-octahedral (0D) units [M4X18].18 It has been revealed that ferroelectric properties were found to appear only in the derivatives characterized by 0D or 2D anionic layers. The most attractive materials, from the viewpoint of optoelectronic applications as light absorbers for photovoltaic cells, appear to be iodide analogs—R3Bi2I9 (where R refers to small-size organic cations or monovalent metallic ones, namely, Cs, Rb, or Ag). It is noteworthy that all the known iodide ferroelectric analogues adopt only the 0D anionic structure.
Organic–inorganic hybrids based on formamidinium (FA) cations, which exhibit ferroelectric properties, are unique. Until now, only two examples of ferroelectrics are known among compounds within the perovskite family, namely, FASnI33 and FAPbI3.19 Therefore, we decided to place the polar FA cation into the iodobismuthate network and to determine the physicochemical properties of such materials. In practice, it is often observed that materials, which exhibit ferroelectricity at lower temperatures, exhibit semiconductor properties at higher temperatures.20
In this work, we report a novel Bi-based ferroelectric material of (NH2CHNH2)3Bi2I9 (FA3Bi2I9), which reveals polar properties in numerous (six) successive phases. We present detailed investigations of its crystal structures, dielectric and electronic properties, and analyze its intriguing ferroelastic domain structure. FA3Bi2I9 is a material characterized by a 0D (isolated bi-octahedra) anionic network. A rich polymorphism of FA3Bi2I9 in the solid state has been confirmed by thermal methods (differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dilatometry) and optical observations. Spontaneous polarization reversibility has been confirmed by both observation of ferroelectric hysteresis and pyroelectric measurements. The physicochemical properties of FA3Bi2I9 are compared with those observed for other halobismuthate(III) and haloantimonate(III) compounds among the R3M2X9-type ferroelectrics.
Experimental
Synthesis
All the materials needed for the synthesis of [NH2CHNH2]3Bi2I9 (FA3Bi2I9) were purchased from commercial sources (Sigma-Aldrich and Merck (HI)) and used without further purification: [NH2CHNH2]·I (>98%), BiI3 (>99.998%), and HI (57%). The crystals were grown by the slow evaporation of a concentrated HI solution containing 3:2 ratio of [NH2CHNH2]·I and BiI3. The salts obtained were recrystallized twice from a methanol solution, and their compositions were verified by elemental analysis: C: 2.15% (theor. 2.13%), N: 4.98% (theor. 4.96%), and H: 1.05% (theor. 1.01%). The single crystals were grown from an aqueous solution at room temperature (RT).
Thermal analysis
DSC experiments were carried out using a PerkinElmer DSC 8500 differential scanning calorimeter at a scanning rate of 4 K min−1 in the temperature range of 100–300 K. In the DSC measurements under a nitrogen atmosphere, the polycrystalline material was placed in hermetically sealed Al pans. Calibration was performed with n-heptane and indium as the standard. Dilatometric measurements (TMA) were performed with the thermomechanical analyzer PerkinElmer TMA 7 in the temperature range of 150–300 K at a temperature rate of 4 K min−1. Liquid nitrogen was used as the cooling medium. Simultaneous thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) were performed using a Setaram SETSYS 16/18 instrument in the temperature range of 300–780 K at a ramp rate of 5 K min−1. The scans were performed under flowing nitrogen (flow rate: 1 dm3 h−1).
Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD)
For all the structures: C3H15Bi2I9N6, Mr = 1695.27 experiments were carried out with MoKα radiation using an Xcalibur, Atlas instrument. Absorption was corrected by multi-scan methods, CrysAlis(PRO) 1.171.38.43 (Rigaku Oxford Diffraction, 2015). Empirical absorption was amended using spherical harmonics, implemented in SCALE3 ABSPACK scaling algorithm. SHELXL2014/7 software was used for structure solution and refinement. The positions of hydrogen atoms were determined from the geometry and refined as riding atoms. Their positions should be considered only as a structure decoration because of a disorder.
Dielectric and polar properties’ measurements
The complex dielectric permittivity, ε* = ε′ − iε′′, was measured using a single-crystal FA3Bi2I9 with the use of an Agilent E4980A Precision LCR Meter operated between 90 and 300 K in the frequency range between 135 Hz and 2 MHz. The overall errors were less than 5%. The dimensions of the crystal were 5 × 3 × 0.75 mm3. The pyroelectric properties were determined by using an electrometer/high-resistance meter Keithley 6517B with a temperature ramp of 2 K min−1 in the same temperature range. Ferroelectric hysteresis loops were determined using a modified Sawyer–Tower circuit at 50 Hz.
Optical measurements
The ferroelastic domain structures of several FA3Bi2I9 crystals were studied by means of an Olympus BX53 optical polarization microscope. The samples were placed in the LINKAM THMS600 heating/cooling stage, where the temperature was stabilized to within 0.1 K.
UV-vis spectra
The absorption spectra in the wavelength range of 300–600 nm were recorded on a Cary 5000 UV/vis/NIR instrument. The spectra of the powder in Nujol were measured at RT. Then, the spectra were corrected by subtracting the background of Nujol. The band structure and projected density of states (PDOS) were calculated using WIEN2k software21 (PBE functional22). K-path for the band structure calculation was prepared using XCrysDen23 software.
Results
Thermal properties (TGA, DTA, DSC, and TMA)
The thermal stability of the FA3Bi2I9 sample was determined by performing simultaneous TGA and DTA between 300 and 780 K. The resulting traces are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). FA3Bi2I9 exhibits an endothermic effect at ca. 600 K in the DTA traces. The crystal seems to be stable up to about 600 K. Above this temperature, the loss of weight starts to exceed 1.5%, which is characteristic of the onset of compound decomposition.
DSC revealed a very complex PT sequence for FA3Bi2I9. The DSC traces for FA3Bi2I9 are shown in Fig. 1. In the low-temperature region (between 300 and 110 K), four reversible heat anomalies assigned to structural PTs are evident: at 203/203 (Phase I ↔ Phase II), 174.6/176.9 (II ↔ III), 131.3/131.3 (III ↔ IV), and 117/120 K (V ↔ VI) on heating–cooling.
 Fig. 1  DSC curves of FA3Bi2I9 crystal measured upon the heating and cooling of a sample. 
Taking into account the shapes of thermal anomalies and temperature hystereses, PTs can be classified as follows: I ↔ II continuous (second order), II ↔ III close to second order, III ↔ IV discontinuous, and VI ↔ V clearly discontinuous (first order). Entropy changes (ΔS) estimated for these transitions are as follows: ΔS(II↔III) = 1.3, ΔS(III↔IV) = 2.72, and ΔS(IV↔V) = 13.2 J mol−1 K−1. The values of the transition entropy for the two lowest-temperature PTs are characteristic of the transitions with an order–disorder mechanism, whereas for the two remaining PTs, we can postulate a displacive mechanism.
Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows the results of the linear thermal expansion (ΔL/L0) measurements along the c-axis (Phase I, P63mc). We show the runs registered during cooling and heating of the sample. It should be emphasized that the dilation anomalies were perfectly reversible. Four thermal anomalies were detected: at 200 K and 175 K, they manifested themselves as changes in the slopes of dilation (continuous transitions), whereas at 133 and 113 K, a rapid expansion of the sample took place that is characteristic of discontinuous transitions. The sequence of PTs detected by dilatometric measurements is in full agreement with those observed in calorimetric studies.
Crystal structure of FA3Bi2I9
The thermal evolution of the lattice parameters reveals five polymorphs of FA3Bi2I9 at low temperatures (Fig. 2).
 Fig. 2  Thermal evolution of hexagonal lattice parameters. Temperatures of the PTs, Tci, obtained from the DSC are marked. Lines serve as guidelines. 
The first one, Phase I, is hexagonal with the unit cell parameters a = 8.71(1) Å, c = 22.01(1) Å, and γ = 120°. The hexagonal system is commonly observed in analogous compounds. Literature survey shows that MA3Bi2I9 (MA: methylammonium)24 as well as guanidinium-based25 and imidazolium-based26 hybrids crystallize in the centrosymmetric space group P63/mmc. All of them are isotypic to the inorganic Cs3Bi2I9,27 the structure of which is virtually identical to Cs3Cr2Cl9.28 In addition, a majority of A3M2X9 compounds (where A stands for a metal ion), which are characterized by M2X93− ions, adopt the centrosymmetric P63/mmc or P63/m space groups.29 Accordingly, the crystal structure of Phase I was resolved in the first approximation in the centrosymmetric space group. However, the results of the dielectric measurements, particularly the presence of a spontaneous polarization hysteresis loop, unequivocally indicate the lack of a symmetry center. Hence, the final model of the structure of Phase I was resolved in the noncentrosymmetric, polar space group P63mc (no. 186).
The PT at Tc1 is associated with the lowering of the crystal class to orthorhombic Cmc21 (No. 36) and pseudo-merohedral twinning. Both phases are group–subgroup related. The Cmc21 space group is the maximal non-isomorphic subgroup of P63mc with index 3, which defines the number of orientation states for the twin domains.30 The PT belongs to the Aizu species, namely, 6mmF2mm.31 It is interesting that the ratio of the lattice parameters b/a is very close to √3, i.e., to that of the hexagonal structure. Therefore, the lattices of the domain states coincide and the diffraction pattern corresponds to a pseudohexagonal lattice. This is shown in Fig. 3a, which reveals the reciprocal space reconstruction of the hk0 layer in Phase II, at T = 190 K. Fig. 3b shows the same hk0 layer in Phase III, at 140 K. After the second PT at Tc2 additional, weak peaks appear, which may be indexed in a doubled 2a or 2b orthorhombic (or 2ahex) superstructure. Similar to Phase II, the lattices of the twin domains coincide, yielding a pseudohexagonal lattice. The average structure (based only on the main peaks excluding the weak satellites) can be refined with Cmc21 symmetry (R1 ∼ 0.06) and has similar atomic arrangement as that of Phase II. Because of the combination of twinning and the very weak intensities of the satellite peaks, we decided not to speculate on the possible structural model of this phase.

Further cooling induces structural deformations that result in a heavily twinned diffraction picture with partially coinciding twin lattices and split diffraction peaks with remarkably reduced intensities. Due to the complex twinning present in FA3Bi2I9, their crystal structures have been resolved only in Phases I and II. The results are presented below.

Phase I. 
The inorganic part in Phase I comprises isolated Bi2I93− bi-octahedra. The asymmetric unit contains two Bi3+ and three I− ions. The Bi3+ cation occupies the C3v symmetry site; the I− ions are located on the Cs position and are populated by a 3-fold axis. The negative charge is balanced by three FA+ ions, which are heavily disordered in Phase I. Each cation adopts at least three different positions. Fig. 4 shows the packing and details of the crystal structure of FA3Bi2I9 in Phase I.

Phase II. 
The PT at Tc1 affects both the inorganic part and counterions. The details of the structure at 190 K are shown in Fig. 5. Symmetry reduction to orthorhombic Cmc21 induces distortion in Bi2I93− bi-octahedra, which lose the 3-fold symmetry and tilt from the b-direction (Fig. 5(a) and (b)). At the same time, the FA+ cations become partially ordered (Fig. 5(c)). As far as the anions are concerned, the number of I− ligands in the asymmetric unit is doubled to six as compared to that in the high-temperature phase. The Bi2I93− bi-octahedra possess Cs symmetry with the mirror plane passing through both Bi3+ and three iodine positions (I(2), I(3), and I(6)), as shown in Fig. 5(d). It appears that the pronounced disorder of FA+ is reduced in Phase II, partially due to the loss of the 3-fold axis along the c-direction. In Phase II, the cations may adopt the C1 or Cs symmetry. Due to the twinning of the sample, the exact location of all the possible orientation states of ions may not be extracted from the diffraction data; therefore, the presented model should be considered as qualitative rather than quantitative.

In Phases I and II, N–H⋯I and C–H⋯I contacts, which meet the criteria for the presence of hydrogen bonds (HBs),32 are abundant. However, in the absence of an unambiguous set of FA+ positions, due to the dynamic and/or static disorder of cations, it is difficult to determine the actual geometry of these interactions. One of the questions that arise is whether these HBs have any impact on the structure of the high-temperature phases or not. In the following, we show that because of the dynamic characteristic of the FA+ disorder, HBs primarily provide specificity rather than stability for the consecutive phases; this occurs, at least, at temperatures at which the cation motion is frozen.
By analyzing the possible positions of the cations, it is evident that the distinct reorientations that occur during the first phase transformation (associated with the loss of the 3-fold axis) affect the inorganic part of the structure, as shown in Fig. 4c and 5c.
In Phase I, all the iodide ions may act as multiple acceptors for numerous forked HBs (see Fig. 6a). In Phase II, the surroundings of the iodide ions and availability of possible hydrogen donors dramatically change. The distribution of positive charges around the bi-octahedra becomes much more asymmetrical, which is shown in Fig. 6b.
 Fig. 6  Distribution of possible N–H⋯I and C–H⋯I contacts around the [Bi2I9]3− bi-octahedra in (a) Phase I and (b) Phase II, and the maximum H⋯I distance is equal to 3.3 Å (boundary of the Jeffrey's criteria); (c) distortion modes for [Bi2I9]3− due to the octahedral distortion in Phase II (Cmc21). 
Accordingly, Bi2I93− octahedrons become more distorted. The most identifiable changes occur in the positions of the terminal iodides, which may shift even by 0.28(1)–0.30(1) Å from the initial placements. Despite the steric effects, which may influence the position and shape of the bi-octahedra, the remarkable change in the specific Bi–I distances is also evident. The apical I(2) iodide atoms stop acting as acceptors in the HBs as a result of these cation reorientations. Consequently, the Bi(1)–I(2) distance is remarkably shortened (from 2.955(1) to 2.904(1) Å). It is worth noting that such a significant contraction of the Bi–I distance concerns only the I(2) iodide atoms; the remaining ones, which still interact in HBs, experience marginal changes. With decreasing temperatures, some of these distances even increase, which may imply strengthening of the HB interactions (Bi(1)–I(1) changes from 2.955(1) at 220 K to 2.975(1) Å at 190 K). In addition, the anisotropic displacement parameters (ADPs) of I(2) are reduced (compared to other ADPs of iodide ligands). The ADPs may be indicators of the degree of disorder around the iodine acceptors. These iodine atoms, which act as multiple acceptors, are spatially frustrated and their ADPs are larger.
Despite these HB interactions, octahedral distortion may be induced by the changes in the activity of the Bi3+ lone-electron pair. In both Phases I and II, Bi3+ is displaced from the geometric center of the iodide ligands, which indicates the aspherical distribution of 6s2 electrons and their interactions with the electronic p states of I−. The change in the lone-pair activity of Bi3+ has been recognized as a source of the structural PT in 2-MImSbI4 and 2-MImBiI4 hybrids with extended 1D anions;33,34 it is also considered as an important source of polar displacements or locally distorted states in hybrid perovskites bearing Pb2+ or Sn2+ ions.35,36 The octahedral distortion parameters Δd and angle variance σ237 for Bi(1)I6 grow in Phase II, yielding increased distortion: Δd increases from 1.99(1) × 10−3 to 2.24(1) × 10−3, whereas σ2 changes from 14.88(6) to 16.45(5). However, in the case of the second octahedron Bi(2)I6, both Δd and σ2 are lower in Phase II (Δd decreases from 2.63(1) × 10−3 to 2.44(1) × 10−3; σ2 is reduced from 20.95(5) to 17.92(5)). Fig. 5 shows the displacements of Bi3+ and I− atoms from the high-temperature sites responsible for octahedral distortion. The lengths of the arrows in Fig. 6 represent the amplitude of the displacements, which are the smallest for the bridging iodide atoms (0.09–0.17 Å), and the largest for the apical iodine atoms (∼0.29(1) Å). The Bi displacements are equal to ∼0.14 Å. The total distortion amplitude for the inorganic part of the asymmetric unit is equal to 1.10(1) Å (AMPLIMODES38). The detailed bond lengths are shown in Fig. 4 and 5.
In the light of the above, it seems that the polar properties of FA3Bi2I9 can be attributed to the orientational ordering of the FA+ dipoles, as well as the polar distortions of the complex anions.

Dielectric measurements
Dielectric spectroscopy was used to characterize the dynamics of the dipolar cations and their contribution to the molecular mechanism of successive PTs below RT. Fig. 7 shows the results of the measurements of the complex electric permittivity (ε* = ε′ − iε′′) in the kilohertz-frequency region.
 Fig. 7  Temperature dependence of (a) real and (b) imaginary parts of the complex electric permittivity of FA3Bi2I9. 
It is evident that the dielectric response (ε′(T,ω)) clearly reflects the presence of structural PTs, which is in agreement with those revealed by the calorimetric studies. The I → II and II → III PTs are accompanied by fairly weak dielectric anomalies (see Fig. 7a). The III → IV PT exhibits a very complex response since the emerging anomaly exhibits a double peak. Approaching 135 K, ε′ critically increases up to εmax′ ≈ 22 and then a practically similar peak appears at four degrees below. The dielectric anomaly in this temperature region is puzzling. It is difficult to state if we encounter an intermediate phase between 135 and 131 K or that the III → IV PT experiences two steps. The lowest-temperature PT at 120 K is accompanied by an abrupt decrease in ε′ down to 16 units, which indicates drastic freezing of the dipolar cation motion. The imaginary part of permittivity (ε′′) versus temperature, as shown in Fig. 7b, shows only marginal changes around the I → II, II → III, and IV → V PTs, and no dielectric relaxation processes are visible in a wide temperature region, except for Phase IV. Both peaks of ε′ are accompanied by a distinct anomaly of ε′′. The dielectric response around the III → IV PT exhibits the feature characteristic of the critical slowing down of the macroscopic relaxation time encountered in the “order–disorder” ferroelectrics. At 155 kHz, in Phase IV, the evident piezoelectric properties of FA3Bi2I9 are revealed.
The ac conductivity, σac, of FA3Bi2I9 was measured above RT (Fig. 8). The obtained results are discussed in terms of the Jonscher universal power law:39 σac′(T,ω) = σdc(T) + ε0ωε′′(T,ω) = σdc(T) + Aωs(1)where Aωs describes the frequency-dependent ac conductivities, where A is a constant dependent on temperature; s is a power exponent, which is generally less than or equal to 1; ω = 2πf (f (Hz)) is the angular frequency; and ε0 is the vacuum permittivity. For the obtained results, the ac conductivity spectra at different temperatures were fitted to eqn (1), and the parameters σdc, A, and s were extracted from this analysis. The results of the adjustment are presented as continuous lines in Fig. 8.
 Fig. 8  ac conductivity (log scale) versus reciprocal temperature, 1000/T, of FA3Bi2I9. 
The frequency dependence of ac conductivity and temperature dependence of the s parameter (see Fig. S3, ESI†) are characteristic of the activation process of the electrical carriers. The reciprocal temperature dependence of σac for FA3Bi2I9 is shown in Fig. 8 as an Arrhenius plot representation, namely, ln(σac) vs. 1000/T. The value of the estimated bandgap for the conductivity at 1 kHz equals to 0.736 eV.
Pyroelectric measurements
The measurements of the pyroelectric current (Ipyr) carried out in the temperature range covering all the phases of FA3Bi2I9 revealed a very complex picture. The measurements were performed in two ways. The first experiment (Ipyr(T)) was done without any pooling of the sample, which was cooled down to 100 K and then the measurements were carried out during heating. The results are shown in Fig. 9.
 Fig. 9  Temperature dependence of (a) pyroelectric current and (b) corresponding spontaneous polarization changes for FA3Bi2I9. Insets: Temperature dependence of ΔPs in the vicinity of the I → II and II → III PTs. 
The peaks of Ipyr were observed for all the four PTs determined by the DSC method. In order to check if the values of the spontaneous polarization in the particular phases are reversible, we devised another measurement modality. This experiment was realized using four cycles, which are described below. The sample was pooled with the dc electric field of ±3 kV cm−1 across the I → II and II → III PTs and then the sample was short-circuited for 30 min in Phase III to eliminate the current due to the space charge. Then, the measurements were performed during heating up (2 K min−1) to RT. The pyroelectric current shows two peaks at ca. 203 and 175 K first for the positive value of +Ipyro and then for the negative one (−Ipyro), both of which were reversible in the positive/negative dc external field.
The resulting spontaneous polarization (ΔPs) versus temperature (T) curves for these two cycles are shown in Fig. 10 (right side). The 3rd and 4th cooling cycles start (after pooling from RT) from 140 K (Phase III) down to 100 K. Two peaks appeared at 131 and 116 K and, similarly to the 1st and 2nd cycle, they exhibited an opposite polarity. The peaks of Ipyr were also reversible in the positive and negative dc external fields. The corresponding ΔPsversus T curve is shown in Fig. 10 (left-hand side). Such a behavior of ΔPs with temperature is extremely rare because in the temperature range described above, the pyroelectric coefficient (dPs/dT) changes its sign three times. The most significant changes in ΔPs, of the order of ±4 × 10−4 C m−2, are visible near Tc(IV→V).

Observation of the hysteresis loop
The hysteresis loops measured at different temperatures (on cooling) are shown in Fig. 11. The presence of the reversible spontaneous polarization (Ps) is confirmed for all the low-temperature phases. It should be emphasized that the value of Ps (2 × 10−2 μC cm−2) at 230 K is continuously reduced on cooling. To some extent, the behavior of Ps is in agreement with the pyroelectric measurements. Nevertheless, the real values of Ps in the subsequent phases are difficult to estimate because of two reasons: (i) a significant increase can be expected in the coercive field with decreasing temperature, which does not enable us to obtain the saturated values of Ps and (ii) the possible change in the direction of the polar axis during the subsequent PTs.

Optical observations in polarized light
The results of the optical observations are shown in Fig. 12. In Phase I, the crystal shape corresponds to at least a 3-fold axis. The visible faces perpendicular to the plates form angles of 120°. The bulk of the crystal exhibits homogeneous transparency without ferroelastic domains.
 Fig. 12  Evolution of the ferroelastic domain pattern for FA3Bi2I9 during the cooling cycle. 
The I → II PT proceeds very slowly and progressively. The contrast evolves from very faint to more intense. The transition may, therefore, be close to continuous. This is corroborated by a weak dielectric anomaly, which does not resemble a lambda anomaly, because the PT is between two polar phases. The domain pattern in Phase II results from the ferroelasticity implied by the point symmetry reduction 6mm → 2mm. The twin-law matrix of Table 1 corresponds to a mirror plane lost in the transition. In addition, a vanishingly small orthorhombic distortion of Phase II with respect to the hexagonal one is reflected in the angles between the visible domain walls, e.g., 59.46° ≈ 60°. However, a shear deformation is also present because the inclusions of the domains within a region of different domains have typical lens-like shapes.40 One of the domains yields a yellowish color and the two other ones are darker. A precise measurement of the angles and the shapes of the lenses may facilitate the structural resolution of the XRD experiment. The domain pattern becomes sharper after the II → III PT. This may result from an increase in the shear deformation, which is reflected in the angle, namely, 58.78°, which is more distant from 60°. The deformation is, however, still too weak to allow the space group to be refined. The crystallographic system seems to remain orthorhombic. The satellites evident in Fig. 3 suggest the doubling of the unit cell. This may result in the presence of antiphase domain walls that are, however, not visible in the polarization microscopy images. In Phase IV, the domain pattern remains generally similar, but more inclusions occur. This may be related with the increasing shear deformation and compensation needed to preserve the integrity of the sample. Phase V exhibits a radical change in the domain pattern. The ferroelastic nature of the domains is, however, clear because the domain walls are neatly planar. The angles close to 60° suggest a hexagonal paraelastic phase.

An insight into the spatial orientation of the domain boundaries shows that the mirror and glide planes of the P63mc group preserved in Phases II–IV are those marked in red in Fig. S4b (ESI†). Further, the shear planes corresponding to the domain boundaries are those marked in blue in this figure. In Phase V, in turn, the role of the planes seems to have interchanged because the angle between the prevailing domain boundaries in Phases IV and V are close to 30°. This would suggest an orthorhombic structure of Phase V stemming from P63mc, but with elementary cell edges along the blue lines in Fig. S4b (ESI†). The shear planes are those marked in red. The mutual orientation of the domain walls in Phases IV and V are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†).
UV-vis light absorption
In the absorption spectrum (Fig. 13a), which extends from about 650 nm toward the UV region, one evident band can be distinguished with the maximum at about 510 nm (2.43 eV). Moreover, in the range of 475–350 nm, two less pronounced bands, at 420 nm (2.95 eV) and 365 nm (3.40 eV), are evident. The presence of these bands in the absorption spectrum is in agreement with the energy gaps between the valence band and band groups placed over the Fermi level found in the theoretical band structure (see Fig. 14).

 Fig. 14  Band structure of FA3Bi2I9 with SOC taken into account. Analogous plot without SOC is shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). 
The bandgap, calculated using DFT taking the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) into account, is equal to 1.89 eV (Fig. 14), which effectively complies with the one determined using the Tauc plot, i.e., 1.85 eV (Fig. 13b). When the SOC is neglected (Fig. S6, ESI†), the bandgap is about 0.5 eV higher than the former one, which indicates that the SOC is strong in the case of such systems. Based on the DFT calculations it is difficult to unequivocally state if the transition is of the direct or the indirect characteristic as the energy difference between these two transition types is lower than 0.1 eV. However, very good agreement between the calculated and experimentally determined bandgaps was achieved only when r = 1/2, which might indicate that the transition is of the direct allowed type.
The optical bandgap has been determined by a variant of the Tauc equation: (αhν)1/r = A(hν − Eg)(2)where h is the Planck's constant, ν is the photon frequency, α is the absorption coefficient, Eg is the bandgap energy, and A is a proportionality constant.41 The value of the 1/r exponent defines the nature of the electronic transitions, whether they are allowed or forbidden and whether they are direct or indirect.42 Typically, allowed transitions dominate in basic absorption processes, resulting in either r = 0.5 or r = 2 for direct and indirect transitions, respectively.
Fig. S6 (ESI†) shows the band structure of FA3Bi2I9, calculated without SOC (ESI†).
The PDOS (Fig. 15) indicates that the valence band is mainly composed of iodine-p states, while the conduction band is formed by the bismuth-p states. According to this, the transitions observed in the absorption spectrum can be assigned to I–Bi ligand–metal charge transfer (LMCT), which is characteristic of such systems.43–45

Discussion
It seems interesting to correlate the dielectric parameters of the discussed compound with the motif of the anionic networks and a type of organic cation placed in the cavities of the anionic substructure for R3M2X9 stoichiometry. The data concerning these parameters are collated in Table 2.

Within the chemical stoichiometry R3M2X9, the ferroelectricity is limited to two types of anionic sublayers among the four possible ones, namely, 0D discrete bi-octahedral units and 2D layers. A 2D structure is usually characteristic of chloride and bromide ferroelectrics containing only small alkylammonium or nonsubstituted ring (e.g., pyrrolidine). For the 2D structure, organic cations (two types: R1 and R2), which occupy the cavities within the layers (R1), are highly disordered and are responsible for the ferroelectric order in the polar phases. Therefore, larger organic cations due to steric effects cannot occupy small vacancies in such layers. In turn, all the known iodide ferroelectrics possess a 0D anionic network and the restriction with respect to the size and symmetry of organic moieties are not apparent. The largest value of the electric permittivity close to Tc is observed for 2D ferroelectrics because easily polarizable anionic layers favor a long-range order of the dipole–dipole interactions. The influence of the dipole moment value, μ, is more obvious in the case of the spontaneous polarization values of ferroelectrics under consideration. Haloantimonate(III) and halobismuthate(III), characterized by 2D anionic structures, usually possess a smaller value of Ps in contrast to their 0D analogues, in spite of the fact that the organic cations of these crystals have larger μ values. Nevertheless, it should be noted that in the FA analogues, the cations possess a fairly small value of μ = 0.23 D, whereas those for the dielectric anomalies are fairly high (εmax = 22). This suggests a significant contribution of the displacement, deformation, and polarization of ions. In summary, we can state that the relation between the structural parameters of crystals and their microscopic and macroscopic properties (Ps and εmax) is more complicated and requires additional studies involving R3M2X9-type compounds. The relationship between ferroelectricity and semiconducting properties (bandgap and usefulness in photovoltaics) is not clear even in well-known ABX3 perovskites. It should be emphasized that in this work, we have studied the interplay between the ferroelectricity and semiconductor properties for the first time in this type of materials.
FA3Bi2I9 is only the second example of R3M2X9-type ferroelectric among haloantimonate(III) and halobismuthate(III) characterized by 0D anionic networks. FA cations possess the smallest dipole moment in the presented group of compounds; therefore, the εmax value is fairly small. The ferroelectric properties of FA3Bi2I9 are extended over all the phases, including the RT phase. FA3Bi2I9 is extraordinarily thermally stable up to near 600 K, which is a very desirable feature for use in photovoltaic materials. The molecular mechanism of the detected PTs is complex, because it may be characterized by either “order–disorder” or “displacive” contributions. The continuous I → II and II → III PTs are due to the limitations in the reorientational motion of highly disordered FA cations and conjugated distortions of discrete [Bi2I93−] units (see Fig. 16). The subsequent PTs, namely, II → III, III → IVa, IVb, and IV → V lead to the progressive freezing of the reorientational motion of cations. It seems, however, that the octahedral distortions, which are strongly related to the changes in the cationic positions, due to the presence of N–H⋯I and C–H⋯I HBs must also accompany successive structural transformations. The analysis of the crystal structure in Phases I and II reveals that the resulting nonzero spontaneous polarization in the c-direction comes from uncompensated dipoles of polar FA+ cations. The presence of a distinct polar direction in FA+ placements causes polar distortions of [Bi2I93−] bi-octahedra.
 Fig. 16  Illustration of FA+ dipoles (indicated by arrows) in partially ordered orthorhombic Phase II. Arrows are not drawn for disordered positions. 
FA3Bi2I9 crystals are stable in a wide range of temperatures in the ambient atmosphere for months. Moreover, they exhibit worthwhile light-absorbing and semiconducting properties.
Conclusions
In summary, we have designed and synthesized a novel molecular-ionic ferroelectric within the haloantimonate(III) and halobismuthate(III) family based on the FA cation [NH2CHNH2]3Bi2I9. It crystallizes in the structure characterized by the discrete anionic form (face-shared bi-octahedra). This material undergoes a very complex sequence of five PTs, and the consequent low-temperature phases exhibit both ferroelectric and ferroelastic properties. Temperature-dependent single-crystal XRD, thermal methods, and dielectric spectroscopy measurements proved that the structural instability of the material is due to the changes in the dynamics of the FA cations and distortions of the anionic framework, which are both strongly coupled via HB interactions. The observed optical properties confirmed that the compound is a semiconductor with an optical bandgap value of 1.85 eV, whereas that calculated using DFT, taking SOC into account, is 1.89 eV. The bandgap energy determined from σAC is equal to ∼0.7 eV, which is smaller than that estimated from the UV-vis spectra. Such smaller values are usually observed for these types of compounds. This observation requires further investigations. The intriguing dielectric properties, including RT ferroelectricity, relatively small bandgap, very good moisture stability, and lead-free composition, make [NH2CHNH2]3Bi2I9 a serious candidate for optoelectronic applications.
