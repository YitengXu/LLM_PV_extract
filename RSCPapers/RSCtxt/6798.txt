    First published on 13th June 2011AbstractThe chemistry of post transition metals is dominated by the group oxidation state N and a lower N-2 oxidation state, which is associated with occupation of a metal s2 lone pair, as found in compounds of Tl(I), Pb(II) and Bi(III). The preference of these cations for non-centrosymmetric coordination environments has previously been rationalised in terms of direct hybridisation of metal s and p valence orbitals, thus lowering the internal electronic energy of the N-2 ion. This explanation in terms of an on-site second-order Jahn–Teller effect remains the contemporary textbook explanation. In this tutorial review, we review recent progress in this area, based on quantum chemical calculations and X-ray spectroscopic measurements. This recent work has led to a revised model, which highlights the important role of covalent interaction with oxygen in mediating lone pair formation for metal oxides. The role of the anion p atomic orbital in chemical bonding is key to explaining why chalcogenides display a weaker preference for structural distortions in comparison to oxides and halides. The underlying chemical interactions are responsible for the unique physicochemical properties of oxides containing lone pairs and, in particular, to their application as photocatalysts (BiVO4), ferroelectrics (PbTiO3), multi-ferroics (BiFeO3) and p-type semiconductors (SnO). The exploration of lone pair systems remains a viable a venue for the design of functional multi-component oxide compounds.

1. Introduction
The relationship between the atomic structure of chemical systems and their macroscopic properties is one of the most fundamental in the physical sciences. Moreover, the microscopic structure is intimately related to the local chemical bonding between the constituent elements, which may be driven by electrostatics for ionic systems (e.g. the octahedral rocksalt lattice of NaCl maximises the Madelung constant) or orbital hybridisation for covalent systems (e.g. the tetrahedral diamond lattice of Si facilitates sp3 hybridisation).
For metal oxides hetero-polar bonds are formed between the positively charged metal and negatively charged oxygen atoms due to the large value of the electronegativity of oxygen.1 The resulting crystal structures of metal oxides can commonly be rationalised by considering the component ions as rigid close-packed spheres with an effective ionic radius.2 The material stoichiometry and radius ratio determine the packing, resulting in the series of high symmetry structures that are ubiquitous in inorganic chemistry. For example, for 1:1 stoichiometry the rocksalt structure with octahedral ion coordination (see Fig. 1a) is favoured for cation:anion radius ratios between 0.732 and 0.414, while the zinc-blende or wurtzite structures with tetrahedral ion coordination are favoured for smaller cation:anion radius ratios. When the radius ratio exceeds 0.732, the 8 coordinate caesium chloride structure is favoured. The fundamentals of chemical stereochemistry began with the work of Lewis3 on molecular structures, and were adapted by Pauling4 in his rules for determining the crystal structures of polar solids. The applicability of these simple guidelines to complex multi-component compounds is well established.5 However, exceptions emerge, especially for heavier cations, where their high electric polarizibility favours non-spherical packing of ions. Two notable cases involve d10 systems such as the Cu(I) ion, where hybridisation of the 3dz2 and 4s orbitals results in the characteristic preference for linear coordination; and Hg(II) in compounds such as HgO, where the hybridisation between 5d and 6s is mediated by O 2p.6 Another major exception is found for cations with a filled s2 electron pair, which is the subject of this review.

Metals found at the lower end of groups 13–16 of the periodic table can exhibit a valence state two lower than the group valence (N), as in compounds of Tl(I), Pb(II), Bi(III) and Po(IV). These arise from so-called inert electron pairs. The stable d10s2p0 electronic configuration results in the formal occupation of the valence metal s orbitals. In the theory of stereochemistry of valence bonds by Sidgwick and Powell,7 these lone pairs of electrons are on equal standing with bonded electron pairs and distribute themselves to minimise electrostatic repulsion. In the modification by Gillespie and Nyholm,8 repulsions involving one pair are recognised as being greater than those arising from standard valence bonds, which explains successfully the bond angles of ammonia and water molecules. Applied to lower valence state metals such as Pb(II), one would expect non-symmetric crystals, where the lone pair electrons occupy the corner of a polyhedron. Indeed, this is the case for PbO in the litharge structure (see Fig. 1b), where all four coordinated oxygen atoms are found on one side of Pb, with the lone pair projected out in the opposite direction. What this theory does not explain is why some compounds formed from the same cation, in the same oxidation state, can exhibit stereochemically active or inactive lone pairs depending on the anion. In organometallic chemistry, these are referred to as “hemi-directed” (active) or “holo-directed” (inert) lone pairs.9
The stability of the lower oxidation state of the metal tends to increased down a group, possibly with an alternation such that the N-2 state for 4th row elements is less stable than expected from a linear interpolation between 3rd and 5th rows; thus in group 14, the divalent state is increasingly favoured in going from Ge to Sn to Pb.10 Compounds formed from the two oxidation states can exhibit very different physicochemical properties. One illuminating example is Pb, where the metallicity of black Pb(IV)O2 is exploited in lead acid batteries,11 while Pb(II)O is an insulating red or yellow solid depending on the orientation of the lone electron pair.12
This Topical Review provides an update of our understanding of cationic lone pair compounds, with an emphasis on solid-state systems. We highlight the structural and electronic aspects of lone pair formation in the context of recent experimental and theoretical insights into the topic. The anomaly found in the existing textbook explanation for these systems is resolved in the revised model; the competition between centro-symmetric and distorted crystal structures is rooted fundamentally in chemical bonding that has an explicit dependence on the anion. Finally, we review recent advances in utilising lone-pair containing materials for technological applications, including photocatalysis and solar cells, and discuss avenues for future materials research based on these systems.
2. Lone pair formation
2.1 Classical model
Contemporary textbooks usually refer to the classical view of the cationic lone pair as introduced by Orgel.2,13 In this model, the lone pair is considered to be derived from an on-site mixing of non-bonding cation s and p orbitals. Due to the fact that s and p orbitals are of different parity, mixing of this sort cannot take place on cations occupying sites with inversion symmetry. However, sp hybridised orbitals may be generated in non-centrosymmetric sites, thus explaining the distorted structures of many materials that have stereochemically active lone pairs. More simply, an electron repulsion treatment8 can be used to rationalise the stereochemical consequences of the hybrid orbitals. The stabilisation of distorted structures can be considered as a second-order (or pseudo) Jahn–Teller instability: upon atomic displacement orbital (sp) hybridisation occurs that reduces the total energy of the system. The ground state is not degenerate in the undistorted system as in a first-order Jahn–Teller distortion, but instead the degeneracy of the lowest energy unoccupied orbital (the p orbital) is removed, thus allowing one component of the split p shell to achieve the same symmetry as the lower energy occupied s orbital. Mixing between these ground and excited states produces the second-order stabilisation.
However, many materials that have the required electronic configuration to form lone pairs on the cation do not display this stereochemical activity. For example, PbO and SnO adopt the litharge structure (Fig. 1b), while PbS and SnTe crystallise in the perfectly symmetric rocksalt structure (Fig. 1a). Orgel attempted to explain the activity of the lone pair through electric polarisation arguments, which depend simply on the energy separation between the atomic s and p orbitals and the equilibrium bond length. Exceptions to the rule, notably for chalcogenides, are attributed to effects of covalency.
Clearly the classical treatment is incomplete and does not provide an understanding of the nature of the stereochemically active lone pair and why it forms in some compounds and why it does not form in others. The diversity of crystal structures adopted by lone pair systems is highlighted in Table 1. The concept of an electron lone pair as a chemically inert species remains popular due to its ability to explain the distorted structures often observed in these materials, but it is unsatisfactory in its generality.

2.2 Revised model
To understand the nature of lone pairs it is instructive to begin with a discussion of the interactions that occur in undistorted structures for these materials. A quantum mechanical analysis, at the level of density functional theory (DFT),14,15 of the electronic structure of PbO16,17 and SnO18,19 in the CsCl structure, the undistorted parent of the litharge structure they adopt, shows that the s2 electrons are certainly not chemically inert. They interact strongly with the anion p states in the valence band giving rise to bonding and anti-bonding states (Fig. 2), which appear at the bottom and top of the upper valence band, respectively. The filled s2 electrons of the cation do not form a non-bonding electron pair. So why does this interaction lead to the formation of distorted structures?
 Fig. 2  Illustration of the orbital interactions that lead to lone pair formation in PbO (upper panel) and the corresponding energy level diagram (lower panel). 
The formation of a distortion in the lattice allows the unoccupied cation p states to hybridize with the anti-bonding states, resulting in a stabilisation of the occupied electronic states (Fig. 2). In the absence of a crystal distortion, the interaction of the cation p orbitals has no net stabilising effect; the interaction is composed of both positive and negative wavefunction overlap, which is forbidden by the crystal symmetry. However, by distorting the lattice, the interaction becomes symmetry allowed and the orbital stabilisation is accompanied by an asymmetric electron density that is projected into the structural void. The asymmetric electron density has the familiar lone pair distribution, but is in fact a stabilized anti-bonding interaction between the electronic states of both the cation and anion.
Subsequent studies comparing PbO with PbS20 and SnO with SnX {X = S, Se, Te}21 have shown that computations based on quantum mechanics not only predict if a directional lone pair will form, but also explain why lone pairs form in some materials and not in others. The relative energy of the cation s and anion p states is critical to the formation of stereochemically active lone pairs. Since the cation p states interact with the anti-bonding levels, it is vital for the cation on-site hybridisation that the anti-bonding levels have a strong component of the cation s states. If there is a substantial cation s presence, then the mixing of the cation p states can result in a strong stabilisation of the anti-bonding state. If, however, the anti-bonding states have only a weak contribution from the cation s states, then the stabilisation will be significantly weaker. The electronic stabilisation must compensate for the reduced coordination in the distorted structures, and hence materials in which the anti-bonding states have only a weak cation s component will not form stereochemically active lone pairs; this is the case for most metal chalcogenides as shown in Table 1b.
The formation of stereochemically active lone pairs (distorted crystal structures) is therefore dependent on the strength of the interaction between the cation s states and the anion p states, and hence on their relative energies. The closer they are in energy, the stronger the interaction and the more cation states are present in the upper valence band, leading to an active lone pair effect. In fact, the cation s states in these materials are lower in energy than the anion p states and hence the most robust (with respect to formation of undistorted structures) lone pairs are found for oxides such as PbO, SnO, Bi2O3, and Sb2O3, i.e. those with oxygen anions in which the p states are relatively low in energy. The corresponding atomic orbital energies are summarised in Fig. 4b. In moving down group 16 from oxygen to sulfur, selenium and tellurium, the anion p states become higher in energy: as calculated at the DFT level of theory22 the orbital energies are −9.0 eV (O); −7.0 eV (S); −6.5 eV (Se); −5.9 eV (Te); −5.6 eV (Po). It should be noted that the largest increase is observed between O 2p and S 3p, and this is where the transition from distorted to symmetric structures generally occurs. The interaction of the anion p states with the cation s states is reduced significantly for heavier anions, leading to weaker on-site hybridisation of the cation s and p states and weaker lone pairs. For the case of PbS, the sulfur anion 3p states are already too high in energy to maintain the stereochemically active lone pair due to the extremely low energy of the Pb 6s states arising from relativistic effects, while for Sn the 5s states are higher in energy and the lone pair is maintained for SnS and SnSe. Tellurium has too weak an interaction with Sn 5s to form a lone pair distortion in its ground-state structure.
Waghmare et al.23 explored the effect of anion p–cation s overlap in the distortion of the rocksalt structured chalcogenides of Ge, Sn and Pb, which follow the same trends discussed above. Similar arguments can also be made for the case of bismuth, with Bi2O3 and Bi2S3 showing stereochemically active lone pairs,24 while Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3 do not, and for antimony, with Sb2X3 {X = O, S, Se} displaying stereochemically active lone pairs and Sb2Te3 not. In fact for the layered crystal structure adopted by Sb2Te3, Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, the anionic lone pair becomes dominant.25
The revised lone pair (RLP) model can be summarised as follows:
• Strong interaction between the cation s and anion p orbitals results in high-energy anti-bonding states with a considerable degree of cation s character at the top of the upper valence band.
• Distortion of the crystal structure to allow for the interaction of the nominally empty cation p states with the anti-bonding orbitals results in the familiar lone pair asymmetric electron density; these are projected anti-bonding states.
3. Quantifying lone pair interactions
3.1 
          X-Ray emission spectroscopy (XES)
A simple and direct experimental approach to establishing the extent of orbital hybridisation between the O 2p states and metal ns states in oxides has been established by Payne et al.26,27 It is based on comparison between Al Kα X-ray photoemission (XPS) spectra and O K shell X-ray emission spectra (XES). XPS measures the total density of states of oxides, although the contributions from the various atomic partial densities of states that are involved in the valence band must be weighted by the ionisation cross-sections for the orbitals involved. O K shell X-ray emission involves radiative decay of electrons into an O 1s core hole and is governed by a strict on-site dipole selection rule, which dictates that only electrons with O 2p character can be involved in the transition. The intensity of a band in XES is therefore directly proportional to its O 2p character, and in the absence of mixing with O 2p states transitions from metal ns valence states would be completely absent. Experimental data for Bi2O3 are shown in Fig. 3 along with the electronic density of states calculated from Density Functional Theory.
 Fig. 3  Valence band Al Kα XPS and O K shell XES spectra from Bi2O3 compared with the total and atom-projected density of states derived from quantum mechanical calculations [Adapted from ref. 27]. The spectra are all presented on a binding energy scale referenced to the top of the valence band. XPS and XES spectra are aligned relative to each other using peak IV. 
Four features labelled I–IV are observed in the XPS data for Bi2O3, in good agreement with the theoretical prediction. The relative intensity of these bands is very different in XES, with band IV at the highest binding energy being much weaker than in XPS. This establishes that band IV is associated with states of dominant Bi 6s character, weakly hybridised with O 2p states. There is excellent agreement with the calculated distribution of the Bi 6s orbital; hence, these results provide direct experimental evidence of the RLP model proposed in Section 2.2.
To quantify this idea, it is possible to make an empirical estimate of the fractional contribution fO2p of O 2p states to the metal ns band. If all the states in the valence band were of pure O 2p character the intensity of the s band (Is) relative to the total intensity of the valence band (Itotal) would be simply M/P where M is the number of metal atoms and P is the total number of valence electrons pairs per formula unit (M = 1, P = 4 for PbO). It follows that:fO2p = (Is/Itotal)/(M/P)For Bi2O3 it transpires that fO2p ≈ 0.2 so that the 6s “inert pair” is only weakly hybridised with the O 2p states.24Fig. 4b shows results from an analysis of experimental and theoretical spectra of the oxides of Hg, Tl, Pb and Bi, including both compounds in the group oxidation state (for Hg, Tl and Pb) and the N-2 oxidation state (Pb, Bi). It can be seen that the extent of hybridisation between the 6s electrons and O 2p electrons decreases progressively with increasing group number as the 6s electrons are increasingly stabilised. The atomic energy levels of the 6s states increase by over 10 eV from Hg to Po:22 −6.8 eV (Hg); −9.3 eV (Tl); −11.9 eV (Pb); −14.4 eV (Bi); −16.8 eV (Po). It is interesting therefore to recall that PoO2 adopts an undistorted fluorite structure, which is because the 6s electrons are now too far below the valence band maximum to allow for significant hybridisation with O 2p states. By contrast we have also seen that TeO2 adopts structures showing the signatures of stereochemically active lone pairs: this reflects the fact that the 5s electrons are less tightly bound than 6s electrons because the relativistic stabilisation is much lower.
 Fig. 4  (a) Closed circles: estimated O 2p contribution to the lowest valence band state derived from intensities in the XES spectra of the post-transition metal oxides HgO, Tl2O3, PbO2, PbO and Bi2O3 as a function of group number. Triangles: the ratio I(O 2p)/{I(O 2p) + I(M 6s)} derived by integrating partial densities from quantum mechanical calculations across the lowest valence band state. (b) Metal s and anion p atomic orbital energies (Kohn–Sham eigenvalues) calculated from DFT. 
The atomic orbital trends, summarised in Fig. 4b, can be used to explain the presence and strength of stereochemically active lone pair compounds: for oxides the strongest cation s–anion p hybridisation is clearly expected between Sn and O where ΔEs–p = 1.4 eV (SnO forms the distorted litharge structure), whilst the weakest interaction is between Po and O as ΔEs–p = 7.8 eV (PoO2 forms the centro-symmetric fluorite structure). The resulting order of stability for lone pair distortions, Sn > Pb > Sb > Bi > Te > Po, follows the crystal structure preferences for these materials (Table 1).
3.2 Hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES)
While XES and XPS can reveal successfully the extent of s–p hybridisation, they are not sensitive enough to the metal s states to be able to observe their contributions to the valence band directly. An approach to overcome this limitation was first exploited by Payne et al.28 Hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES) is a technique that is rapidly becoming the photoemission experiment of choice for researchers who require “bulk sensitive” electronic structure with minimal surface contribution, and atomic orbital selectivity. Conventional XPS (hν = 1486.6 eV (Al Kα)) has an effective probing depth of 1–1.5 nm, whereas for HAXPES (hν = 6–8 keV), the effective probing depth is of the order of 15–20 nm. As well as the benefits stated above, the changes in photo-ionization cross-sections, upon increasing photon energy, have a profound influence on the information obtained, regarding the orbital's comprised within the valence band of the material under study.
Taking the specific example of (structurally undistorted) PbO2, XPS and HAXPES measurements have shown that the Pb 6s states do not lie at the top of the valence band, as previously assumed, but lie predominantly at the bottom, nearly 10 eV lower than the Fermi energy.28 This result is also strengthened when used in combination with the (previously described) technique of XES as summarised in Fig. 5. In the simplest description, PbO2 has a filled valence band of O 2p states and an empty conduction band of Pb 6s states. However, in contrast to common expectations, the 6s contribution to conduction-band states is shown to be less than the contribution to the valence band, which again is supported by ab initio calculations.

Valence and conduction band photoelectron spectra of PbO2 measured at (b) hν = 1486.6 eV and (c) hν = 7700 eV. (d) O K shell X-ray emission spectrum. 
The combination of HAXPES with element specific XES and electronic structure calculations provides a uniquely powerful and general approach to the characterization of the bulk electronic structure of oxide materials and, in particular, of the distribution of metal s character in structurally distorted post-transition metal oxides. This approach has already been exploited by Ogo et al. to study the electronic structure of SnO in the context of its semiconducting behaviour,29 and has identified the contributions of Sn 5s to the valence band of heavily Sn-doped In2O3 samples (i.e. ITO).30 HAXPES will be an essential tool for the future characterisation of lone pair containing systems.
4. Property engineering of lone pair containing oxides
4.1 Binary oxides
Main group metal oxides are typically wide band gap materials, which have applications in catalysis, fuel cells, batteries, gas sensors, and as substrates for material growth.31 For cations with an electronic configuration of d10s0p0, such as Zn(II) and In(III), the resulting oxides are good electron conductors owing to the low carrier effective mass provided by the spatially delocalised conduction band.32 This is also the case for the oxides of Pb(IV) and Sn(IV), as both PbO2 and SnO2 can support an excess of electron carriers owing to partial chemical reduction of the cations.11,32,33 Indeed, Sn(II) species with active lone pairs have been characterised on the surface of SnO2,34 where electron accumulation occurs. Occupation of the lone pair states (an electronic configuration of d10s2p0) for SnO and PbO results in a substantial band structure change: both materials absorb significant fractions of visible light, and favour hole over electron conduction. As low band gap, hole conducting oxides are a rarity, these features make lone pair systems of direct interest for electronic and optoelectronic applications, including solar energy conversion in photocatalytic and photovoltaic devices.35–37 For further control of the material properties it is necessary to go beyond the simple binary compounds.
4.2 Ternary oxides
Forming multi-component oxide systems introduces the possibility for property engineering through cation substitution: adjusting the crystal structure and/or composition of a material to tailor the physicochemical properties for specific applications. We will discuss a number of ternary oxides that have been of recent scientific or technological interest, before highlighting open avenues for the rational design of more complex lone pair containing solid-state systems.

4.2.1 
            BiVO4. 

            Bi2O3 is a p-type semiconductor, which at high temperatures converts to a fast oxygen ion conductor.38,39 By combining Bi2O3 with V2O5, BiVO4, an active and stable photocatalyst is formed.40,41 Similar to Bi2O3 itself, the Bi coordination environment in the ternary compound is weakly distorted, forming an elongated octahedron (see Fig. 1d); however, the orbital interactions involving the lone pair electrons are a key factor in determining the photoactivity of the material. It has been shown through first-principles calculations42 and subsequent spectroscopic analysis43 that the activity of BiVO4 arises from optical transitions between anti-bonding Bi 6s–O 2p orbitals at the top of the valence band and empty V 3d orbitals at the bottom of the conduction band. Moreover, the filled antibonding states at the top of the valence band are key to providing the shallow acceptor levels necessary for p-type conductivity.44


4.2.2 
            Bi2Sn2O7. 
The high solubility of Bi2O3 with other metal oxides makes it a practical starting compound for forming more complex materials. The combination of Bi2O3 with SnO2 results in the stable ternary oxide Bi2Sn2O7. The A2B2O7 stoichiometry is typical of the cubic pyrochlore structure; however, to facilitate the formation of an asymmetric electron density on Bi, a √2 × √2 × √2 monoclinic structural distortion occurs up to 130 °C, resulting in a crystal structure with 352 atoms that was recently solved by X-ray diffraction.45 For this case, the role of metal s–oxygenp hybridisation has been established;46 however, the low phase transition temperature reflects the subtle balance between the stereochemical activity of the lone pair, and the increased coordination of the centro-symmetic phase. The calculated total energy difference between the equivalent distorted and symmetric phases reduces from 0.9 eV per formulae unit for SnO, to 0.4 eV for PbO, and just 0.2 eV for Bi2Sn2O7,47 which follow the trends discussed earlier.
The presence of the structural distortion for Bi2Sn2O7 has a direct influence on the valence band position (ionisation potential),47 which in turn will influence the catalytic properties through the stability of electronic and ionic defects on the material surface. Frustrated lone pair behaviour for another pyrochlore structured material Bi2Ti2O4, as well as the defective pyrochlore Pb2Sn2O6, were investigated theoretically by Seshadri,48 and this phenomenon was proposed as the source of high-k dielectric behaviour in this class of material system.


4.2.3 Perovskites. 

            ABO3
            oxides adopting the cubic perovskite crystal structure (Fig. 1c) are known for their ferroelectric properties: tilting and rotating the BO2 octahedra result in electric polarisation (in response to the intrinsic dipole), and a series of ferroelectric and anti-ferroelectric phases may be accessible thermodynamically through the application of temperature, pressure and/or external lattice strain. Incorporating a lone pair cation into the lattice provides an additional driving force for non-centrosymmetric structures, as demonstrated by PbTiO3, PbVO3, as well as the related compounds SnWO4 and PbWO4.49 The usage of lone pair cations in ternary oxides is one of the most promising routes to obtain robust multi-ferroic compounds, i.e. combining ferromagnetic and ferroelectric behaviour in a single material. For this purpose, one approach is to combine a lone pair “A” cation (ferroelectric component), with a magnetic “B” cation (ferromagnetic component),50e.g. BiFeO3 and BiMnO3. In principle, the critical transition temperatures of these materials can be further controlled through the formation of solid-solutions or dilute doping.

4.3 Avenues for material design
In the last decade, there has been an upsurge in the research of lone pair containing systems. At a fundamental level, sub band-gap illumination of heavy metal oxides was found to result in a reversible red-shift in the optical absorption spectra,51 while there has been substantial technological interest in the area of photocatalysis, pioneered by the group of Kudo.52 As discussed above, occupied cation s states serve both to raise the valence band energy through the addition of cation s–anion p coupling and induce lighter hole masses than typical oxides. The case of BiVO4 has been discussed, and recent experimental work has identified a number of other promising candidate systems: Bi2WO6;53Bi12TiO20;54BiTaO4;55Bi2MoO6;56PbBiO2Cl;57PbSb2O6;58SnWO4;59SnNb2O6;60Sn2TiO4.31
One of the grand challenges associated with the hydrogen economy is to find a cheap and sustainable photocatalyst that would enable the generation of hydrogen from water using only sunlight. The criteria imposed on such a material are not trivial, including: visible light absorption; stability in aqueous solutions; valence and conduction bands aligned to the water redox potentials. One promising route is to combine lone pair s2 cations (chromophores) with d0 cations (catalytically active metals), e.g.(Sn,Sb,Pb,Bi)x(Ti,V,Nb,Mo,Ta,W)yOz. Other elements can be incorporated to further tailor the properties, e.g.Al or Ga could increase the chemical stability or tune the band edge positions, while dn transition metals could promote absorption of longer wavelength photons. Going beyond known or previously synthesised compounds, many mineral structures that can in principle combine these cations exist, e.g. the ilmenite (ABO3), rosiaite (AB2O6) and trirutile(AB2O6) structures. There are many opportunities for material design and discovery in this area and more complex configurations that remain to be investigated.
5. Conclusions
The lone electron pair, associated with compounds formed from metals with an s2 electronic configuration has been shown to have a strong dependence on the electronic states of the anion. The relative energy differences between the electronic states involved in the orbital interactions can explain in a straightforward manner the structural diversity of these compounds, including the strength or absence of the structural distortions associated with the lone pair of electrons. For metal oxides, the energy separation between the cation s and O 2p level follows the stereochemical activity of the lone pair: Sn > Pb > Sb > Bi > Te > Po. Experimental evidence for the role of the “inert” lone pair in chemical bonding can be achieved through the combination of electronic spectroscopies, in particular, through the application of hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which can provide bulk sensitive measurements of the metal s distribution in the valence band of metal oxides. The revised model provides a mechanism to understand the current generation of lone pair materials, as well as offering predictive guidance on useful combination of cations for future design of functional material systems.
