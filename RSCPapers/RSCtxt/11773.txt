    , Accepted 19th October 2020First published on 19th October 2020AbstractOrganic solar cells (OSCs) and perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) are emerging photovoltaic technologies with solution-processability and performance that can feasibly be tuned via the molecular design of key organic photovoltaic materials (OPMs). With the innovation of fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs), the power conversion efficiency (PCE) values of OSCs have been pushed as high as 18%. Meanwhile, molecular hole-transport materials (HTMs) have demonstrated promising advantages compared to the widely used material spiro-OMeTAD, allowing PCEs of over 20% to be realized in dopant-free PVSCs. In this review, we provide updates on progress related to the design and use of dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP)-based OPMs as symmetric/asymmetric FREAs and dopant-free HTMs for obtaining record-high power conversion efficiencies and stable solar cells since 2016, with the objective of giving insightful views into material design and device construction strategies to boost photovoltaic performance. Strategies relating to judicious molecular designs are demonstrated for fine-tuning the electronic structures, crystallinity, thermal properties, and molecular orientations of DTP-based OPMs. Structure–property correlations are discussed in detail. New device engineering and processing strategies tailored to DTP-OPM-based solar cells are emphasized. Finally, we briefly summarize original designs of DTP-derived OPMs to address the challenging issues facing emerging solar cells and highlight key considerations relating to the development of new efficient OPMs.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) and perovskite solar cells (PVSCs), which are low cost and have high specific weights and solution processability,1–5 have been developed as the most promising photovoltaic technologies. The main driving force has been the great innovations that have been made in the areas of organic photovoltaic materials (OPMs) and device engineering in the last two decades. For bulk-heterojunction OSCs, their performance is largely dependent on light-absorbing blends of donors (polymers or oligomers) and acceptors (fullerenes or nonfullerenes) in the active layers. In particular, molecular fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) adopting acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structures have opened up a new era of high-efficiency OSCs,6 with power conversion efficiency (PCE) records frequently beaten through the use of a series of ITIC, M34,7 and Y6 star acceptors.1 For PVSCs, the perovskite (organic–inorganic hybrids or all-inorganic) layers possess excellent light harvesting abilities and high charge-carrier mobility, with the device performance and stability strongly relying on the use of interfacial layers between the perovskite and two electrodes.8 Hole-transporting materials (HTMs) help to not only extract and transport holes but also block electrons from the perovskite layer in typical n–i–p-junction PVSCs. The development of dopant-free HTMs as alternatives to spiro-OMeTAD [2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene] (Fig. 1) has become a research hotspot, with synthesis cost, device performance, and stability considered in combination.9 Benefiting from the unremitting exploration of OPMs, PCEs surpassing 18% and 25% have been achieved in the best-performing single-junction OSCs10 and PVSCs, respectively.11

The design of central electron-donating cores (i.e., fused-ring structures of multiple building blocks) is crucial for developing high-efficiency OPMs for use in both OSCs and PVSCs. Among them, dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) is a very promising aromatic unit that was first reported in the design of high hole-mobility polymers.12 Bearing an sp2-hybridized nitrogen atom with a lone electron pair located in its perpendicular p orbit, the DTP unit possesses a π-electron conjugate system with extended delocalization. Consequently, the geometry distortion of DTP spreads over the entire backbone in the excited state to yield smaller reorganization energies, endowing it with strong electron-donating capabilities. Therefore, DTP moieties facilitate intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and the fine-tuning of energy levels, allowing narrow optical bandgap (Eoptg) values to be obtained.13,14 Moreover, the electron-rich N atom in DTP can increase the stability of organic semiconductors in the oxidized state, endowing optoelectronic devices with long-term operational stability.15
In this review, we focus on the molecular design of DTP-fused symmetric and asymmetric FREAs and DTP-core HTMs for use in OSCs and PVSCs, respectively. The impact of the material structures on the optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties of ternary OSCs and device processing approaches for optimizing the morphologies of active layers and the photovoltaic performance are discussed in detail. Moreover, two-dimensional DTP-based semiconductors working as HTMs for application in PVSCs are described. Finally, strategies for the molecular design of DTP-based OPMs and device optimization tailored to the as-developed OPMs are summarized. This review presents instructive guidance on how the material design of organic semiconductors can be used to fine-tune energy levels, molecular conformations/orientations, and charge-transport capabilities, tackling challenging issues and allowing cost-effective, stable, and high-efficiency OSCs/PVSCs to be obtained via solution-processing techniques.
2. The design and synthesis of DTP-based building blocks
The DTP unit was mainly used as an individual donating block in the synthesis of organic semiconductors during early development. Compared with some other DTP-like blocks (dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]borole (DTB),16 dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]furan (DTF),17 dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]phosphole (DTPh),18etc.), nitrogen-containing DTP has more suitable energy levels and bandgaps, and better stability in air. N-Functionalized DTP was thus widely used for OPM design with enhanced device properties and stability.19,20 For example, the D–A-type polymer PDTPDTBT (structure shown in Fig. 1), obtained via coupling DTP with 4,7-di(2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT) units, was first reported by Hashimoto and co-workers in a study of its photoelectric properties.15 Featuring good solubility and a narrow Eoptg (∼1.46 eV), PDTPDTBT allowed a low PCE of 2.18% in OSCs when blended with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM). A larger spectrum of D–A polymer donors, via alternating DTP with various acceptor units, was further explored in fullerene-based OSCs,21 where PCEs below 4% were achieved with relatively poor photovoltaic parameters, including open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit density (JSC), and fill factor (FF). These are attributed to the high-lying HOMO energy levels and limited optical absorption of the DTP polymers, and to the poor morphologies of the blends. The insufficient electron-donating capabilities of single DTP units can be overcome via coupling (or fusing) DTP with other D units, where extended conjugation is achieved in the resultant electron-donating blocks.12Via fusing two DTP units into a six-member-ring D core, Jen et al.13 developed two A–D–A type FREAs (SN6IC and SN6IC-4F, SN6IC-4F structure shown in Fig. 1) via adopting 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)-malononitrile (IC) or 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IC-2F) as A terminals. Compared with FREA analogues without nitrogen atoms, SN6IC and SN6IC-4F exhibit raised highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels and narrower Eoptg values. Moreover, PBDB-T:SN6IC and PBDB-T:SN6IC-4F blended films present better molecular stacking, resulting in higher crystallinity and better charge transport. PBDB-T:SN6IC-4F-based OSCs achieved a superior PCE of 13.2%, indicating the potential of DTP for constructing fused-ring D cores for FREAs. It is widely accepted that most efficient FREAs generally have the following characteristics: (i) strong absorption covering a large region of the incident solar spectrum for harvesting a sufficient photocurrent, (ii) matching HOMO and LUMO energy levels between the donor and acceptor to provide a suitable driving force for exciton dissociation, and (iii) good solubility and high charge mobility.22–28 Therefore, several classic molecular design directions, such as side-chain engineering, core engineering, and end-group engineering, have been employed to pointedly modify the absorption, energy levels, and aggregation for high-performance FREAs. More importantly, ternary and tandem OSC device structures can alleviate the intrinsic defects of low VOC and JSC values in single-junction binary OSCs.29–32 Also, a wide variety of device engineering approaches (solvent thermal annealing, thermal substrate spin-coating, etc.) have been developed for fine-tuning the morphologies of the blended films, thereby further promoting the OSC performance.30,33,34
Relative to the rise of DTP in FREAs, the exploration of DTP blocks utilized for HTMs is lagging a long way behind, which is reflected by the first report only appearing in 2018. Two DTP-core HTMs (H16 and H18, structures shown in Fig. 1) were designed with bi- or tri-(p-methoxyphenyl) arms.8 Featuring higher conductivity and hole-mobility, H16-based PVSCs outperformed those with H18 as the HTM. An impressive PCE of 18.16% was obtained with a high JSC of 23.28 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.704, comparable to those obtained using the state-of-the-art-HTM spiro-OMeTAD.35 In addition, the low synthesis cost (1/5 that of spiro-OMeTAD) and good device stability endow H16 with potential as a HTM for commercial PVSC applications.
In view of the fast progress being made in relation to new-generation solar cells, Tang's group conducted systematic work to discover the potential of using versatile DTP as the D unit in constructing both FREAs and HTMs for high-performance OSCs and PVSCs. A nine-membered-ring electron-rich electron-donating block, indacenobis-(dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrol) (INP), was designed first. Through coupling with IC or DFIC, two DTP-fused symmetric nonfullerene acceptors (INPIC and INPIC-4F) were thus developed.36 Featuring absorption extended to ∼892 nm, an OSC based on INPIC-4F blended with PBDB-T achieved the highest PCE of 13.13%, with a JSC of 21.61 mA cm−2, a FF of 71.5%, and a VOC of 0.85 V, with a relatively low energy loss (Eloss) of 0.54 eV. A library of INP-core symmetric FREAs has been explored via molecular engineering by Tang's group. Meanwhile, single-DTP-unit fused-ring asymmetric core based FREAs have been explored, taking advantage of the stronger intermolecular binding energy and greater dipole moments in comparison to symmetric FREAs.37–40 Excitingly, our DTP-based asymmetric FREAs perform well in OSCs, with PCEs among the record values obtained for asymmetric FREA-based devices in the literature. The outstanding photovoltaic performance of DTP-based FREAs in OSCs is attributed to the delicate molecular design and use of various device engineering techniques to fine-tune the molecular conformation, packing, and, thus, morphology in blends with polymer donors. Inspired by the success of DTP as a D unit in FREAs, we have explored DTP-core linear and star-shaped HTMs for use in dopant-free PVSCs. Strategies including side-chain engineering and conjugation extension were employed for the design of DTP-based HTMs. Benefiting from high charge transport, film-forming capabilities, and suitable energy levels, N-alkyl-DTP-based linear HTMs exhibited over 99% quenching efficiency of perovskite photoluminescence.41 The dopant-free HTM-based PVSCs thus showed a highest PCE of 20.38%, with JSC of 22.82 mA cm−2, and an astonishing FF of 0.787. Further molecular design involving two-dimensional conjugation along the DTP core and the construction of four-armed donating moieties endowed the dopant-free PVSCs with record-high PCEs (over 21%) and long-term stability.42 Our research signifies the great potential of DTP for developing cost-effective HTMs for use in high-performance dopant-free PVSCs.
The tedious synthesis of N-functionalized DTP was first reported by Zanirato and co-workers (Route 1 in Fig. 2).43 The synthetic route was then improved by Rasmussen,44 opening up the door to DTP derivatives for wider applications (Route 2 in Fig. 2). Importantly, the modified approach significantly shortens the overall reaction procedure and cuts costs by replacing 2,3-dibromothiophene with 3-bromothiophene as a starting material. The simple change to a primary amine as a starting material allows for the generation of a large spectrum of N-alkylated DTPs. The scaling up of Rasmussen's synthesis is, however, difficult, with quite low overall yields.

As is known, solubility is a key consideration in the development of electron acceptors; the selection and configuration of side chains on the conjugate backbone define the solubility, intermolecular interactions, and molecular packing. Therefore, it is attractive to optimize DTP synthesis for higher yields and accessibilities. For this, one-step Pd-catalyzed Buchwald–Hartwig coupling between primary amines and 3,3′-dibromo-2,2′-bithiophene was developed, as shown in Route 3 in Fig. 2.45 The reaction allows for the facile synthesis of various N-functionalized DTPs with high yields. As a result, N-functionalities, including linear and long branched alkyl chains and a few benzyl-like aryl chains, can be introduced onto DTP, providing enormous possibilities for molecular design and optimization.
For OPMs, conjugation extension is an important approach to improve interchain π–π overlapping while obtaining broader absorption. Such extension can be most directly achieved via introducing two-dimensional conjugated side chains at the N-position of the DTP unit. Based on our research efforts, a more versatile and facile synthesis route, as shown in Route 4 in Fig. 2, was developed with 4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (N-H DTP) as the key synthon.41,42 A Cu(I)-catalyzed Ullmann reaction between 3,3′-dibromo-2,2′-bithiophene and benzamide readily afforded N-H DTP in satisfactory yields in the presence of N,N′-dimethylethylenediamine (DMEDA) (Fig. 2). Phenyl-like aryl side chains can be introduced on the N atom via Pd-catalyzed Buchwald–Hartwig coupling, while N-thienylated DTPs were synthesized via Cu-catalyzed reactions between aromatic iodides and N-H DTP.41,42,46
3. DTP fused-ring electron acceptors for organic solar cells
3.1 Symmetric DTP-based FREAs
Typically, highly efficient FREAs contain an A–D–A backbone to facilitate ICT effects and manipulate energy levels. Fast intermolecular charge transport can be promoted through the tight π–π stacking of end-capped groups.47–49 Also, the halogenated end group strategy is one of the most commonly used methods to modulate energy levels, narrow band gaps, and enhance ICT effects. However, this strategy can also easily result in poor solubility or the strong self-aggregation of acceptors, resulting in the corresponding blends showing inferior morphologies with excessive phase separation and improper intermolecular packing behavior. The manipulation of the side chains can usually solve these issues, but sometimes it can also result in different device properties to what are expected. Therefore, rational A–D–A structural design and the screening of optimal A/D combinations are crucial for developing efficient FREAs. Via replacing the thienyl units in indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (IDT) with DTP, Tang's group first developed a nine-member-ring fused-ring block, INP, as a planar electron-rich D core for a large spectrum of FREAs.36,47 Like classic ITIC, two INP-core FREAs named INPIC and INPIC-4F with N-octyl side-chains were developed via adopting IC and its difluoro-counterpart IC-2F as the corresponding A ends (the structures are shown in Fig. 3). The impact of the fluorinated end groups on device performance was thus studied, and INPIC-4F exhibited stronger near-infrared absorption with a narrower Eoptg value of 1.39 eV in comparison to INPIC. As listed in Table 1, fluorination at the A terminals downshifts the energy levels of INPIC-4F (−5.42 eV for the HOMO and −3.94 eV for the LUMO) in relation to INPIC (−5.36 eV for the HOMO and −3.82 eV for the LUMO). Upon considering complementary absorption and well-matched energy levels, the wide bandgap polymer donor (PBDB-T) was selected to blend with these INP-based FREAs. PBDB-T:INPIC-4F blend films showed stronger π–π stacking, with a predominant face-on orientation, in comparison to PBDB-T:INPIC ones, facilitating charge transport in the active layer and leading to high JSC and FF values in OSCs (Fig. 4a and b). Optimized PBDB-T:INPIC-4F devices delivered a highest PCE of 13.13% with VOC of 0.85 V, JSC of 21.61 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.715. The high JSC value is attributed to high electron mobility (μe = 1.28 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 S−1) with balanced charge transport (μh/μe = 1.28) based on space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) tests. Eloss was found to be as low as 0.56 eV.

Further side-chain engineering at the N-alkyl position was employed to modulate the solubility, crystallinity, and aggregation of DTP-based FREAs. It is known that the length and degree of branching in side-chains can affect the intermolecular interactions of FREAs and, furthermore, the blend morphology and OSC performance. Via changing the n-octyl group of INPIC-4F with branched 2-ethylhexyl or 2-butyl-1-octyl side chains, we developed INPIC-EH and INPIC-BO (Fig. 3).50 The three FREAs show similar Eoptg values and HOMO/LUMO energy levels based on optical and electrochemical measurements (Fig. 4c), suggesting the negligible effects of side chains on absorption and energy levels. The long and branched side-chains endowed INPIC-EH and INPIC-BO with increased solubility and higher crystallinity. When blended with PBDB-T, INPIC-EH- and INPIC-BO-based blend films thus exhibit low miscibility and large domain sizes in comparison to INPIC-4F ones. Deteriorated morphology usually results in severe recombination and poor charge transport in active layers. As a result, INPIC-EH- and INPIC-BO-based OSCs exhibited moderate PCEs of 11.9% and 11.2%, respectively (Table 1).
To expand the absorption range and modulate the energy levels of INPIC-4F, we carried out chlorination at the IC ends to afford IPIC-4Cl, aiming to reveal the impact of IC substitution (-H in IPIC, -2F in IPIC-4F, and -2Cl in IPIC-4Cl) on the optoelectronic properties of the resultant FREAs (as shown in Fig. 3).51 In this case, the n-octyl chain was replaced with a larger 2-butyl-1-octyl branched chain to ensure that these FREAs had sufficient solubility. IPIC-4Cl exhibits higher levels of molecular aggregation, probably due to the formation of strong intramolecular non-covalent interactions (e.g., F⋯H, F⋯S, F⋯O, Cl⋯O, etc.). Indeed, IPIC-4Cl shows an extended absorption range (λonset = 939 nm), with red-shifts of 78 nm and 40 nm in comparison to IPIC and IPIC-4F, respectively. When blending with PBDB-T as an active layer, the IPIC-4Cl-based film shows the smallest π–π stacking distance (dπ–π), 3.54 Å, based on a grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) study, indicating the preference of this blend to undergo intense molecular packing (Fig. 4d and e). Smaller domains can also be observed in PBDB-T:IPIC-4Cl film based on resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) measurements (Fig. 4f), indicating the formation of more donor:acceptor interfaces in the blended film, which facilitate exciton separation and result in high JSC values in these devices. As shown in Table 1, the corresponding PBDB-T:IPIC-4Cl-based OSCs exhibited an outstanding PCE of 13.4% with a higher JSC value of 22.2 mA cm−2. A slightly lower Eloss value of 0.54 eV was also observed in comparison to INPIC-4F-based devices.
Besides modulating the solubility, energy levels, and crystallinity of FREAs, side-chain engineering can help to control the molecular orientation and, thus, the aggregation of thin films. To promote large-area solution-processed OSCs for commercial applications, researchers are keen to design photovoltaic material systems suitable for use in treatment-free high-efficiency “as-cast” devices. For this purpose, the design of FREAs with unified molecular orientation and moderate crystallinity that match with polymer donors is of utmost importance. Along this line of inquiry, we have explored the impact of both the type and positioning of solubilizing side chains in INPIC-4F, hence, two novel FREAs called m-INPOIC and p-INPOIC were synthesized via introducing m-hexyloxy and p-hexyloxy onto the phenyl rings of the INP core of INPIC-4F instead of hexyl (Fig. 3).52 Though sharing similar energy levels and absorption properties, m-INPOIC exhibits predominantly face-on orientation in contrast to the mixed face-on/edge-on orientations observed for INPIC-4F and p-INPOIC. Impressively, after moving the alkoxy group from a para- to a meta-position, m-INPOIC film exhibits a well-defined (010) peak in the out-of-plane direction and a (100) peak in the in-plane direction, suggesting highly ordered face-on crystal packing. It is noted that the alkoxy positioning greatly modulates the molecular orientation of m-INPOIC and p-INPOIC (a schematic illustration is shown in Fig. 4g). A unified molecular orientation is helpful for making as-cast and stable OSCs. An as-cast PBDB-T:m-INPOIC device achieved a PCE of 12.1% (Table 1) without any use of processing additives or device engineering (e.g., thermal or solvent annealing, or vapor treatment). The m-INPOIC-based blended films showed low surface roughness (RMS = 1.86 nm), appropriate domain sizes, and optimal phase separation, where an interpenetrating nanofibrous network was formed. Via further introducing [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as a solid processing aid to build more excellent 3D charge transport channels, as-cast ternary OSCs delivered an impressive PCE of 14.0% with a dramatically improved FF (from 0.669 to 0.713), which is among the highest PCEs for as-cast single-junction OSCs reported in the literature to date. More importantly, PCEs of over 11% can be easily achieved in PBDB-T:m-INPOIC:PC71BM OSCs, even with an active layer thickness of over 300 nm. Also, over 95% of the PCE can be retained after storage of the devices for 20 days. The outstanding tolerance to film thickness and the efficiency stability of the as-cast devices make m-INPOIC a promising candidate acceptor for large-scale use in solution-processable OSCs.
A similar strategy has been explored for the replacement of hexyl in INPIC-4F with a triisopropylsilyl counterpart FREA, INPIC-Si,53 showing a narrow Eoptg value (1.53 eV) and a maximum absorption peak at 800 nm (Fig. 3). The incorporation of PC71BM assisted the weak absorption of the PBDB-T:INPIC-Si blend in the 300–500 nm short-range wavelength. The good compatibility of the three components helps to form effective charge transport channels in the ternary active layers. As shown in Table 1, PBDB-T:INPIC-Si devices achieved a moderate PCE of 11.79%, with JSC of 19.80 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.661, while PBDB-T:PC71BM devices exhibited a PCE of 6.26% with JSC of 11.73 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.641. Upon adding 20 wt% PC71BM as a third component, PBDB-T:INPIC-Si ternary OSCs delivered an impressive PCE of 13.26% with improved JSC of 20.98 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.708 (see Table 3). The PCE of 13.26% is among the top values for ternary OSCs with fullerene-derivative and nonfullerene materials as acceptors. INPIC-Si-based ternary cells obtained an approximately 12.5% PCE increase in comparison to binary examples, which originated from the simultaneously increased JSC and FF values of the optimized ternary OSCs. The improvement is attributed to the increased absorption and improved morphology of the active layers. INPIC-Si-based binary blends showed large phase separation, in contrast to the compact filamentous structure with tiny domain sizes of PBDB-T:PC71BM blends. Ternary blends with 20% PC71BM, however, exhibited a bicontinuous nanofibrous structure with appropriate phase separation, leading to better exciton dissociation and charge transport than their binary counterparts.
3.2 Asymmetric DTP-based FREAs
Relative to symmetric FREAs, the development of asymmetric FREAs was basically stagnant before 2016.40 Asymmetric FREAs boast the feasibility of chemical structure change, allowing photoelectric properties and molecular aggregation to be modulated to match with polymer donors for high-performance OSCs. Besides these advantages, asymmetric FREAs may additionally possess stronger intermolecular binding energies and larger dipole moments than their symmetric counterparts, promising higher FFs and PCEs in OSCs.37–40 Asymmetric FREAs can be obtained via breaking the symmetry of the fused-ring donating core, side chains and accepting ends.40 When we developed INPIC-4F as a high-efficiency acceptor for use in OSCs, its strong crystallinity made it difficult to solution-process large-area OSCs using conventional methods.
To address this issue, we thus developed asymmetric fused-ring donating cores via replacing one DTP block of INP with a relatively weak electron-donating unit, including thiophene (T), thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT), and dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene (TTT) units (Fig. 5). Via coupling the asymmetric core with mono-fluorinated 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)-malononitrile (IC-F), we designed three new acceptors, i.e., IPT-2F, IPTT-2F, and IPTTT-2F, bearing seven-, eight- and nine-member-ring donating cores, respectively.14 Among them, IPT-2F showed the largest red-shifted absorption peak (ca. 36 nm) from solution to film, indicating more well-aligned and compact intermolecular stacking in the solid state. The HOMO energy levels of IPT-2F, IPTT-2F, and IPTTT-2F (structures shown in Fig. 5A) are elevated along with an extension of π-conjugation, while the LUMO energy levels show a downshifting trend. Interestingly, the size of the fused-ring core determines the molecular conformation of the asymmetric FREAs. Theoretical calculations and electric potential simulations confirm the existence of stable and preferred S-shaped conformations for IPT-2F and IPTTT-2F, and a C-shaped conformation for IPTT-2F. This conformation change may be explained by the formation of weak intramolecular O⋯S non-covalent interactions induced by the oxygen atoms on the accepting end and the sulfur atom on the donating core. When blended with PBDB-T to make OSC devices, the S-shaped IPT-2F- and IPTT-2F-based blends exhibited perfect nanofibril morphologies with homogeneous and regular phase separation, while a heterogeneous blended phase structure was detected in C-shaped IPTT-2F. Impressively, the PBDB-T:IPT-2F-based devices delivered a high PCE of 14.0% with VOC of 0.86 V, a high JSC value of 22.4 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.724 (Table 2). IPTTT-2F- and IPTT-2F-based OSCs exhibited a moderate PCE of 12.3% and a lower PCE of 11.4%, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, a PCE of 14% is among the highest PCE values for binary OSCs with asymmetric FREAs given in the literature. The better performance of the IPT-2F-based OSC can be explained based on GIWAXS patterns, i.e., the PBDB-T:IPT-2F blend shows a preferred face-on orientation, with a stronger π–π stacking peak in the out-of-plane direction and a lamellar stacking peak in the in-plane direction (Fig. 5E). The more dominant face-on orientation and more ordered textures of the long nanofibrils (Fig. 6a) lead to more favorable charge transport between the top and bottom electrodes of the devices.

In order to increase the electron-donating capacity of the IPT-donating core, we explored the replacement of thiophene in IPT with selenophene to design a new asymmetric donating core, i.e., selenopheno[2′′,3′′:5′,6′]-s-indaceno[2′,1′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]thieno[2,3-d]pyrrole (DTTPSe). Three DTTPSe-cored FREAs have been developed via coupling with the accepting ends of IC (DTPPSe-IC), IC-F (DTPPSe-2F), and IC-2F (DTPPSe-4F).54 The effects of fluorination and the number of fluorine atoms on the accepting end groups of the FREAs on the optoelectronic properties and molecular aggregation in blended films were systemically investigated (Fig. 5B and F). Compared with IPT-4F, DTPPSe-4F exhibited a ∼20 nm red-shifted absorption peak and ∼0.02 eV narrower Eoptg with increased electron-donating capabilities after thiophene–selenophene replacement. On the other hand, increasing the number of fluorine atoms on the IC end resulted in significantly decreased LUMO energy levels, from −3.84 eV (DTPPSe-IC) to −4.05 eV (DTPPSe-2F) and −4.10 eV (DTPPSe-4F), while the HOMO levels varied within the −5.38 to −5.53 eV range (Fig. 6b). For DTPPSe-based FREAs, most of their surface has a positive electrostatic potential (ESP) while negative regions are only localized at the end groups. A decrease in electron density on the intermediate skeleton and an enhancement in electron density at the end groups can be clearly observed moving from DTPPSe-IC to DTPPSe-2F to DTPPSe-4F, indicating electron movement to the fluorinated end to facilitate electron transport (Fig. 6c). DTPPSe-2F showed better compatibility with PBDB-T, as indicated by the lower level of phase separation in the blended film relative to those with the other two DTPPSe-based FREAs. OSCs based on PBDB-T:DTPPSe-2F delivered the highest PCE of 13.76%, with JSC of 22.16 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.84 V, and a FF of 0.737, outperforming DTPPSe-IC- and DTPPSe-4F based devices (9.88% and 12.03%, respectively) (Table 2). A PCE of 13.76% is a record for an OSC using a FREA containing selenophene. Morphological studies showed that the formation of a bi-continuous interpenetrated network of nanograins is beneficial for charge transfer in the active layer, thus leading to enhanced electron mobility (μe = 5.12 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) and a more balanced μe/μh (1.08).
With the optimal asymmetric thieno[2′′,3′′:5′,6′]-s-indaceno[2′,1′:4,5]dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (IPT) core for the best-performing IPT-2F in hand, we conducted further molecular engineering with two side chains and the halogenation of the accepting ends to modulate the energy levels of the asymmetric FREAs. As shown in Fig. 5C, four FREAs (IPT-4F, IPTBO-4F, IPT-4Cl, and IPTBO-4Cl) were developed to explore the optimal molecular structure for the best-performing OSCs.55 Theoretical simulations show that the N-octyl chain mainly adopts stretching conformations relative to the conjugation plane, which exerts negligible impact on molecular aggregation. However, the 2-butyl-1-octyl branched chain (BO) on the sp2-N atom is almost perpendicular to the conjugate plane due to steric hindrance from the hexylphenyl side chains, which would suppress excessive molecular aggregation. Via considering both the size of the halogen atoms and the shielding effect of alkyl chains on the flank stacking of the conjugated backbone, we can calculate the total maximum backbone bare lengths (Lb) of all these FREAs (Fig. 6d and e). Reasonably, it is difficult for IPTBO-4F to form a suitable stacking arrangement, as it has the smallest Lb value of 24.31 Å, while IPT-4Cl, with the largest total Lb value of 29.56 Å, could induce extensive aggregation. However, IPTBO-4Cl and IPT-4F, with medium total Lb values, can achieve balanced solubility, molecular aggregation, and stacking. These modeling results agree well with the photovoltaic parameters, and GIWAXS and morphology studies (Fig. 5G). Upon blending with PM6, IPT-4F- and IPTBO-4Cl-based OSCs outperformed IPTBO-4F- and IPT-4Cl-based ones (Table 2). IPTBO-4Cl devices exhibit an optimal PCE of 15%, with VOC of 0.893 V, JSC of 23.15 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.726. IPT-4F-based devices yielded a PCE of 14.96%, with VOC of 0.914 V, JSC of 22.08 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.742. The PCE of 15% overcame the record for asymmetric FREA-based OSCs once again. Dual side-chain engineering with solubilizing alkyl chains and the halogenation of accepting ends is demonstrated to simultaneously increase the JSC and FF values of asymmetric FREA-based OSCs.
The molecular engineering of IPT demonstrates its great potential for use as an asymmetric fused-ring donating core for FREAs. It is widely recognized that the halogenation of the accepting end groups can manipulate the energy levels and Eoptg values of FREAs to obtain efficient OSCs. For FREAs, their energy levels and spectral absorption are mainly manipulated via adjusting the strength of the A (e.g., halogenation) or fused D (conjugation variation) units. In symmetric INP constructed via flanking an indacene core with two DTP units, it is difficult to introduce bulky functionality onto both DTP units due to steric hindrance when the indacene core was fully substituted at sp3-C. However, the asymmetric IPT core with a thiophene unit on the far side provides more potential for structural modification. For this purpose, we have designed three FREAs via introducing electron-withdrawing substituents, including 2-ethylhexyloxy (INO-4F), 2-ethylhexyl (IN-4F), and chloro (IPCl-4F), at the thiophene β-position.56 The energy levels, molecular packing, and device performance were characterized systematically (Fig. 5D, H, 6f and g). The contraction of Eoptg values and decreased energy levels can be observed as the electron-withdrawing capabilities of the substituent increase. IPT-4F, INO-4F, IN-4F, and IPCl-4F showed gradually decreasing miscibility with the polymer donor PM6. All IPT-based FREA blended films with PM6 exhibit only face-on orientation from GIWAXS observations, consistent with IPT-2F and IPT-4Cl. However, the IPT-4F and IN-4F blended films presented weak π–π stacking (010) diffraction peaks relative to those of their IPCl-4F and INO-4F counterparts, suggesting that packing and crystallization are severely affected by steric hindrance from β-substituents at the thiophene end. As a result, PM6:INO-4F and PM6:IPCl-4F blended films showed high levels of large-scale aggregation due to poor miscibility and strong crystallinity, which may affect the charge dissociation and transport in OSCs. A blended film morphology that is fully covered with nanofiber domains may show variations in fiber dimensions and alignments in double-molecular-engineering IPT-core FREAs. Compared with PM6:IPT-4F blended films with a crystal coherence length (CCL) of 24.3 nm, PM6:IN-4F has a decreased value of 7.53 nm from GIWAXS testing, confirming the steric hindrance effect of the 2-ethyloctyl chain. As depicted in Table 2, INO-4F-based OSCs delivered a maximum PCE of 13.69%, with VOC of 0.93 V, JSC of 20.46 mA cm−2, and a high FF of 0.720. Considering the highest PCE of 14.96% obtained for IPT-4F-based devices, we should be reminded of the effects of careful molecular engineering on the balance between miscibility, packing, and energy levels, so as to obtain simultaneous increases in photovoltaic parameters.
4. DTP-based FREAs for ternary organic solar cells
The use of ternary OSCs has been demonstrated to be an efficient and simple strategy to improve device performance, mainly due to enhanced photon harvesting through using materials with complementary absorption or energy levels and improved charge transfer upon the introduction of a third component.57–64 Ideally, ternary OSCs can achieve remarkably improved PCEs thanks to the simultaneous enhancement of photovoltaic parameters (VOC, JSC, and FF) compared with binary devices. The key considerations when searching for suitable third components for successful ternary OSCs include complementary absorption spectra, high absorption coefficients, good compatibility and miscibility compensation, high charge-carrier mobility, and cascade energy level alignment in the active layer materials.
A suitable third acceptor can optimize photon harvesting, phase separation, and charge conduction pathway formation in the active layer.63–65 Importantly, cascade energy level alignment can lead to substantial improvements in exciton dissociation and reductions in charge recombination, resulting in better OSC performance. As such, PBDB-T:INPIC-4F binary OSCs have been optimized through the addition of MeIC1 (a second FREA) as the third component (Fig. 7) with the aim of boosting absorption in the range of 520–700 nm.66 Due to the good compatibility between MeICl and INPIC-4F, they prefer to form an alloy state with tunable LUMO levels, resulting in varied ternary OSC VOC values that are dependent on the MeIC1 content (Fig. 7a, inset). When MeICl was added, the crystallization and molecular orientation of the binary blend gradually changed. The ternary device was optimized upon 50 wt% MeICl addition, which was accompanied by a more ordered arrangement and improved crystallinity. The ternary OSCs achieved a maximum PCE of 13.73% with synchronously optimized VOC of 0.88 V, JSC of 21.86 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.714 (as shown in Table 3); this was one of the best PCEs reported from ternary OSCs at that time. A close comparison study of the photovoltaic parameters of the ternary and binary OSCs showed that PBDB-T:INPIC-4F cells have high JSC of 20.81 mA cm−2 (VOC is only 0.85 V and the FF is only 0.709), while PBDB-T:MeICl devices exhibit VOC of 0.90 V and a FF of 0.731 (JSC is only 17.53 mA cm−2). The ternary OSCs inherit the advantages of the two binary cells. This strategy further gives more in-depth insight into the material selection criteria for fabricating high-efficiency ternary OSCs: (i) complementary absorption spectra for enhanced photon harvesting and good compatibility between the blend components for improved charge transfer (Fig. 7b); and (ii) complementary photovoltaic parameters in the two corresponding binary cells (Fig. 7d).66 The selection of a third component with suitable energy levels is a prerequisite to avoid charge trapping.65,67,68

It is widely considered that moderate phase separation between polymer donors and FREAs could facilitate charge transport and reduce charge recombination.66,69,70 A ternary strategy is advantageous not only for intensifying absorption but also for optimizing the morphology upon the addition of the third component.71–74 Since PBDB-T:m-INPOIC blends exhibit low structural order, we introduced IT-M as the third component to modulate the domain size in the ternary blend.75 The domain size is 13.3 nm for PBDB-T and 32.1 nm for m-INPOIC in binary blends. The addition of 10 wt% IT-M leads to the growth of both domain sizes, which are enlarged to 14.8 and 35.0 nm for PBDB-T and m-INPOIC, respectively. The enlarged length scale of phase separation can increase charge transfer and balance charge carrier mobility while minimizing trap-assisted recombination. Excessively increased domain sizes and phase separation are observed upon the addition of 20 wt% IT-M. The ternary blend with 10 wt% IT-M shows the smallest fractal dimension of 2.6 based on grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) studies, suggesting the existence of loosely packed aggregates of m-INPOIC. As shown in Table 3, the resultant ternary OSC delivered a maximum PCE of 13.9% compared with 12.8% for the binary OSC, with simultaneously increased VOC (0.86 V), JSC (22.2 mA cm−2), and FF (0.713) device metrics. The success of PBDB-T:m-INPOIC:IT-M ternary OSCs suggests that a complex between a low-order FREA and a third component can result in a blend with better phase separation, thus improving charge generation and inhibiting recombination.
Combining FREAs with fullerene derivatives to fabricate OSCs has been proven to be an effective strategy for enhancing PCEs. Fullerene derivatives (e.g., PC61BM and PC71BM) feature high electron mobilities and isotropic electronic transmission, rendering them promising third components for optimizing binary OSCs. Furthermore, FREAs and fullerene derivatives exhibit good compatibility despite their quite different chemical structures, which is beneficial for preparing efficient ternary OSCs. Thus, there is a great potential to achieve highly efficient ternary OSCs via integrating the advantages of fullerene derivatives and DTP-based FREAs. PBDB-T:INPIC-Si-based devices were optimized via introducing PC71BM to enhance light absorption and charge mobility.53 The incorporation of PC71BM strengthens the absorption of the original binary OSC from 300 to 500 nm. Photoelectrical research shows that the photogenerated exciton densities are increased while charge recombination is decreased, leading to improved JSC. Morphology studies show that PC71BM plays a vital role in regulating the molecular arrangement and phase separation. INPIC-Si-based blended films show flocculent structures with large domain sizes. Ternary blends with the addition of 20–40 wt% PC71BM showed distinctly decreased domain sizes and bicontinuous nanofibrous morphology. Balanced exciton dissociation and charge transmission were achieved, resulting in enhanced FF values. PBDB-T:INPIC-Si:PC71BM ternary OSCs achieved a PCE of 13.26%, along with VOC of 0.892 V, JSC of 20.98 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.708 (Table 3).
The advantages of PC71BM for optimizing binary OSCs are further demonstrated in a PBDB-T:IPIC-4Cl blended system.51 The addition of PC71BM into the binary blend generated EQE values of over 70% in the range of 500–700 nm. The binary blended films present high and relatively balanced charge mobilities (μh = 1.26 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, μh/μe = 1.26), while the PBDB-T:IPIC-4Cl:PC71BM (1:1:0.3) ternary blended film showed a higher μh value of 2.73 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and more balanced charge mobility (μh/μe = 1.02). This more balanced hole/electron mobility in the ternary blend partially contributed to the improved JSC and PCE values of the ternary OSCs. As expected, PBDB-T:IPIC-4Cl:PC71BM (1:1:0.3) devices showed a boosted PCE of 14.3%, JSC of 23.3 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.822 V, and a FF of 0.746 (Table 3); while the PBDB-T:IPIC-4Cl binary devices exhibited a PCE of 13.4%, JSC of 22.2 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.813 V, and a FF of 0.740.
Besides enhancing OSC performance via improving photon harvesting, charge transport, and phase separation in the active layer, the addition of PC71BM as a third component can contribute significantly to OSC device stability. Considering the performance of our developed as-cast PBDB-T:m-INPOIC OSCs, limited by a moderate FF (∼0.669), we introduced a third component, PC71BM, as a solid processing aid for device optimization.52 The 162 nm-thick PBDB-T/m-INPOIC/PC71BM (1:1:0.15, w/w/w) blend-based OSCs had a maximum PCE of 14%, with greatly enhanced JSC of 22.8 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.716. The PCE of 14% is among the record efficiencies for as-cast single-junction OSCs reported to date. More importantly, the ternary devices showed outstanding tolerance to film thickness, i.e., all photovoltaic parameters remained almost stable upon increasing the active layer thickness from 82 nm to 202 nm, and high JSC (≥22 mA cm−2) and FF (≥0.700) values were obtained with PCEs of over 13% even with an active layer thickness of 202 nm. A PCE of 11% was even maintained with an active layer over 300 nm (Table 3). A doctor-bladed ternary device (0.1 cm2 active layer area) delivered a decent PCE of 12.6%, which is one of the highest values for doctor-bladed devices. Importantly, ternary OSCs with added PC71BM exhibited excellent stability under thermal stress (80 °C, N2), light soaking, and air conditions (room temperature, 20–40% humidity), while over 95% of the PCE can be retained after 20 days of storage.
It can be seen that DTP-fused-ring-based FREAs possess great potential for designing efficient ternary OSCs. On one hand, a third component that shares a similar conjugated backbone structure with the FREA (e.g. MeIC1 with INPIC-4F) may exhibit good compatibility with DTP-based acceptors. Such compatibility can facilitate the formation of suitable crystalline domain sizes with good phase separation, leading to highly efficient OSCs. On the other hand, PC71BM can be used as either a suitable third component or solid processing aid to reduce morphological defects in some DTP-based binary blends, leading to enhanced charge transfer and finer morphologies in the active layers.
5. The device processing of DTP-based organic solar cells
The suitable optimization of device manufacturing processes can greatly boost the efficiencies of OSCs. As is well known, the morphology of the active layer greatly affects the generation of photons, exciton dissociation, and charge transmission.76–79 During past years, introducing fluorine (or chlorine) atoms into FREAs has been widely explored to improve device performance.80–82 However, halogenated FREAs have a strong tendency to aggregate and crystallize compared with their non-halogenated counterparts, which may induce excessive phase separation in blended films. Controlling the crystallization of fluorinated (or chlorinated) FREAs in the device manufacturing process is a key step for improving the efficiencies of OSCs.

Via screen-casting solvents with different boiling points, we can modulate the solvent evaporation window to fine-tune the molecular aggregation of INPIC-4F and, thus, phase separation in PBDB-T:INPIC-4F blended films.83 Since molecular FREAs crystalize faster than polymer donors, an appropriate solvent system should be used to synchronize the molecular aggregation process during blended film casting. This can effectively control the molecular order and phase separation in photoactive layers. As depicted in Fig. 8, when conventionally used chlorobenzene (CB) was employed as the casting solvent, the INPIC-4F phase grew into large spherulites and underwent excessively large phase separation with PBDB-T.83 This blend-based OSC presented poor device performance due to the rough blend surface, weak absorption in the short wavelength region, inefficient exciton dissociation, and poor charge transport properties in the active layers. In turn, casting with fast-evaporating chloroform (CF) led to small domains, smooth active layers, reduced absorption in the long wavelength region, and the π–π stacking of both materials. When a CB:CF (1.5:1, v/v) solvent mixture was employed as the casting solvent, the blended films showed the strongest spectral absorption over the whole wavelength region. An intermediate film drying time results in continuous phase-separated networks, improving exciton dissociation and balancing charge transport. Both PBDB-T and INPIC-4F molecules were largely aligned with face-on π–π stacking. The optimized PBDB-T:INPIC-4F devices achieved a remarkable PCE of 13.1% with high JSC of 22.0 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.727 (Table 4).

Another method to optimize the morphology of PBDB-T:INPIC-4F blends is to control the molecular organization time via casting films on hot substrates.33 In conventional spin-coating, solvent vapor prolongs the molecular organization process during blended film casting, allowing INPIC-4F to quickly crystallize into polycrystalline spherulites. Blended films thus undergo large phase separation, and the inefficient exciton dissociation and poor charge transport resulted in low device efficiency below 10%. On the contrary, casting the films on hot substrates suppresses the formation of polycrystalline structures while encouraging the face-on π–π stacking of INPIC-4F (as shown in Fig. 8). This transformation of packing behavior significantly enhances absorption intensities at long wavelengths. The as-obtained fine vertical phase separation and decreased domain size promoted efficient exciton dissociation and balanced charge transport, so that a remarkable maximum PCE of 13.1% was achieved (Table 4). This impact is different from that of thermal annealing on blended films with lower crystallinity. A recent study by T. J. Marks demonstrated that the thermal annealing of PBDB-TF:Y6 blended films did not change the film crystallinity, R-SoXS characteristic size scale, relative average phase purity, or phase separation as seen in TEM images, but rather it facilitated Y6 migration to the BHJ film top surface, which changed the PBDB-TF/Y6 vertical phase separation and intermixing, and reduced the bottom surface roughness. These morphology changes increased the average electron and hole mobilities at least 2-fold; in particular, the increased μh value dominates and leads to increased FF and PCE values.82
In general, OSC performance based on DTP-fused-ring-core FREAs is largely affected by the molecular orientation, crystallization, and π–π stacking, and by the phase separation in the active layer during device fabrication and operation. The use of appropriate casting solvents and hot-substrate spin-coating can promote the formation of suitable domain sizes and phase separation, thereby enhancing light utilization, exciton dissociation, and electron transport.
6. DTP-core hole-transport materials for dopant-free perovskite solar cells
A workhorse molecular HTM, spiro-OMeTAD, has been developed for highly-efficient PVSCs.35,84 Structurally, pristine spiro-OMeTAD film has very low hole mobility due to the introduced spiro-center (a tetrahedral carbon linking two aromatic moieties), improving its glass-forming properties but preventing crystallization and giving it propeller-like arms. The low hole mobility can be addressed via processing with tert-butylpyridine (t-BP) and lithium bis(trifluoromethyl sulfonyl)imide as additives and using cobalt(III) complexes, like FK209, as typical dopants. However, these additives and dopants can induce the degradation and corrosion of perovskite absorbers. Firstly, all t-BP, Li-TFSI, and cobalt salts are hygroscopic; this promotes the ingress of water into the perovskite layer and can ultimately cause perovskite degradation.85–88 Also, doped spiro-OMeTAD requires a post-oxidation procedure, which is harmful to the perovskite layer. This oxidation process can cause reproducibility problems, as it is difficult to precisely control the level of oxidation, leading to performance decay and the failure of PVSCs.89–91 Accordingly, spiro-OMeTAD-doped HTM-based high-efficiency PVSCs show a trade-off between device performance, cost, and stability. Furthermore, the lengthy and expensive synthesis of spiro-OMeTAD and its subsequent costly sublimation for purification result in a high price (ca. $500 per g). Despite tremendous efforts being focused on developing new HTMs (especially dopant-free ones) to replace spiro-OMeTAD, most reported molecules have not yet been used to realize PCEs of over 21% and stable PVSCs.
DTP features as a planar fused block that is beneficial for intermolecular π–π stacking. The occupied p-orbitals of the heteroatoms (S,N) are in conjugation with the π orbitals of the aromatic units, offering stronger electron-donating character. Similar to carbazole, numerous chemical modifications are allowed utilizing the N atom and fused rings. As such, DTP-core HTMs can possibly offer desired high hole mobilities, suitable energy levels, high glass-transition temperatures, and good film-forming properties. Sandoval-Torrientes et al.92 first explored the potential of fully-doped DTP-core HTMs for PVSCs through the design of star-shaped TTPA-DTP and TTPA-BDT, via connecting four triphenylamine (TPA) arms to N-methoxyphenyl DTP and benzodithiophene (BDT) cores. The resulting crystalline TTPA-DTP showed a high glass-transition temperature of 112.8 °C and a HOMO level of −4.98 eV. In a standard n–i–p configuration PVSC device, fully doped TTPA-DTP-based PVSCs delivered a maximum PCE of 15.6% with large hysteresis. This performance is much lower than the PCE of 18.1% for doped TTPA-BDT- and 17.7% for doped spiro-OMeTAD-based devices, which may be explained based on its hole mobility being one order of magnitude lower (4.91 × 10−5 S cm−1), its reorganization energy being higher, and its conductivity being lower than spiro-OMeTAD. Via reducing the two TPA arms, an N-methoxyphenyl DTP-core HTM (H16) was obtained with planar conjugation, which presented higher conductivity (9.75 × 10−5 S cm−1) and hole mobility (5.55 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) than spiro-OMeTAD.8 As a result, fully doped H16-based PVSCs delivered maximum PCEs of 18.16% and 15.53% in reverse and forward scans, comparable to those of doped spiro-OMeTAD-based devices (18.27% and 15.65%). The crystallinity of DTP-core HTMs is found to govern the trade-off between charge mobility and film morphology during doping.
To develop successful dopant-free HTMs (without the use of any additives or dopants), challenging issues needed to be tackled, including obtaining a suitable HOMO energy level matching perovskite, high hole mobility, and excellent film-forming on the perovskite layer, to generate efficient hole extraction and transport and to promote high-performance PVSCs. In this regard, Tang's group modulated the N-substitution of the DTP unit and extended its conjugation to fine-tune the physicochemical characteristics of DTP-core p-type semiconductors as high-performance dopant-free HTMs. Via flanking a thiophene unit between a DTP core and TPA arm to extend the conjugation for high hole mobility and a suitable HOMO, we developed two DTP-core HTMs with different N-alkyl chains, i.e., DTPC8-ThTPA and DTPC13-ThTPA, with synthesis costs of $15.06 and $14.36 per g, respectively (the structures are shown in Fig. 9a).41 Theoretical calculations showed the nearly planar conjugation configurations of both HTMs. The alkyl substituents can balance well the crystallinity and solubility of the HTMs, resulting in amorphous and smooth films on perovskite absorbers. Furthermore, the stacking behaviors of the conjugated molecules were efficiently controlled by the branched alkyls. Despite having the same oxidation potentials during electrochemical measurements, DTPC13-ThTPA possessed a larger ionic potential (5.04 eV) than DTPC8-ThTPA (4.94 eV) (Fig. 9b). DTPC13-ThTPA revealed an encouraging hole mobility of 2.16 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 5-fold those of DTPC8-ThTPA (3.48 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and spiro-OMeTAD (3.43 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) obtained from SCLC tests. The potential of DTPC13-ThTPA as a high-efficiency dopant-free HTM was explored via using MA0.7FA0.3PbI2.85Br0.15 as the light absorber in a planar n–i–p PVSC. The dopant-free DTPC13-ThTPA-based devices delivered VOC of 1.135 V, JSC of 22.82 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.787, resulting in a highest PCE of 20.38% in reverse scan mode (Table 5), outperforming a state-of-the-art fully-doped spiro-OMeTAD-based device (PCE: 19.85%) (Fig. 9c and d). Importantly, dopant-free DTPC13-ThTPA-based PVSCs showed average and stable PCEs of 19.30% and 18.9%. N-Octyl DTP (DTPC8-ThTPA) dopant-free devices showed a relatively lower PCE of 18.37%.

To further improve the photovoltaic performances of DTP-based HTMs, we further designed a two-dimensional conjugated DTP-core HTM (DTP-C6Th) via replacing the alkyl chain of DTPC13-ThTPA with an N-hexylthiophenyl substituent, with a synthesis cost of $30 per g. The 2D conjugation effectively enhanced the intramolecular interactions, leading to an increased hole mobility of 4.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for DTP-C6Th (Fig. 9a).42 As depicted in Fig. 9e and f, DTP-C6Th as the dopant-free HTM demonstrated excellent hole extraction from the perovskite layer via showing more efficient photoluminescence quenching (over 99%) and a shorter carrier lifetime of 10 ns in comparison to 65% quenching and a lifetime of 158 ns for spiro-OMeTAD. As a result, after careful device optimization via inserting an ultrathin PMMA passivating layer and tuning the perovskite composition with Br (7.5%), we obtained an impressive PCE of 21.04% with a steady-state efficiency of 20.36% from dopant-free DTP-C6Th-based PVSCs. This PCE represents the record value for dopant-free PVSCs employing small organic HTMs. In addition, DTP-C6Th-based unencapsulated devices displayed no PCE drop when stored in a glovebox for 60 days. Furthermore, over 85% of the initial PCE can be retained after storing for 60 days in air with relative humidity of around 35%, confirming the excellent long-term stability (Fig. 9g). The suitable ionization potential (IP) of ∼−4.94 eV, and good hole mobility and film-forming capabilities (Fig. 9h–j) of DTP-C6Th are critical for obtaining stable and efficient PVSCs.
The thermal stability of organic films is another key factor that has an impact on device lifetimes. It is preferred that the desired organic dopant-free HTMs have an amorphous nature with a high glass-transition temperature (Tg). On the basis of the structure of DTPC8-ThTPA, we further synthesized a novel star-shaped HTM with an N-octyl DTP core flanked by two TPA arms substituted with thiophene bridges (Fig. 9a).93 A thermodynamic study revealed its amorphous features and high Tg of 120.3 °C. DTPC8-ThDTPA showed superior hydrophobicity, and deeper HOMO levels were also realized. As a result, PVSCs based on dopant-free DTPC8-ThDTPA achieved a PCE of 19.42%, comparable to doped spiro-OMeTAD-based devices (19.59%) (Table 5). Recently, a linear N-(4-hexyloxyphenyl)DTP-core HTM (M129) was designed via adopting the methoxy-free building block 11,11-dimethyl-5-propyl-5,11-dihydroindeno[1,2-b]carbazole to replace the TPA arms as an electron-donating unit.94 Impressively, M129 exhibited a substantially increased decomposition temperature of 432 °C and Tg of 170 °C. Due to the unreduced IP, M129 achieved a high VOC value of 1.12 V. Together with a JSC value of 23.30 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.780, doped M129 delivered a remarkable PCE of 20.35%. Meanwhile, undoped M129 also realized a high PCE of 17.50%. The M129 device can retain 94% of its original PCE after 800 h at 30% humidity, and the PCE slightly decreased to 82% of the initial value after 1000 h when the humidity was increased to 40%. The superior stability compared with TPA-terminated HTMs can be attributed to its decreased hydroscopic nature.
In summary, DTP as a versatile building block has demonstrated great potential when designing molecular HTMs for use in PVSCs. However, the chemical design of organic HTMs should be examined very carefully because various material factors need to be considered, such as energy levels, hole mobility, glass-transition temperatures, device stability, and synthesis costs. The interactions between the HTM and perovskite absorber are also very important for reducing interfacial recombination losses. Nevertheless, we believe that DTP-derived dopant-free HTMs, when designed with suitable energy levels, hole mobility, and film-forming properties, can become promising alternatives to doped spiro-OMeTAD for use in high-efficiency and stable PVSCs.
7. Summary and perspectives
In this review, we have provided an overview of our recent research efforts related to developing dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole as a promising donating unit for constructing fused-ring electron acceptors for high-efficiency OSCs and for designing hole-transport materials for dopant-free stable PVSCs. The tailoring of the molecular design to modulate the energy levels, molecular orientation, and charge carrier mobility is elaborated on. Correlated device engineering and large-area device processing strategies are also discussed from the aspects of ternary devices, mixed solvents and hot substrate processing, as well as doctor-blade coating. Molecular engineering, including side-chain engineering and conjugation extension, are the main approaches used to fine-tune solubility, crystallinity, LUMO/HOMO levels, film-forming behavior, charge carrier mobility, charge extraction capabilities, and the morphology of the active layer or a layer on top of the perovskite layer. For instance, the replacement of the alkylphenyl side chain of a symmetric fused-ring donating core with meta-alkoxyphenyl can induce a FREA to adopt a predominantly face-on orientation, promoting charge transport. “As-cast” FREA-based binary or ternary OSCs exhibit high performance, good device stability, and excellent tolerance to film thickness. Importantly, the asymmetric fused-ring core acceptors can readily alter the planarity of the backbone and undergo intermolecular π–π stacking to achieve a unified face-on orientation in the solid state. Conjugation extension can afford asymmetric FREAs with switchable molecular conformations between C-type and S-type, modulating their morphologies in the active layers and alleviating trap-assisted recombination. A combination of the side-chain engineering of the donating cores and halogenation of the accepting ends of FREAs has been proved to be an effective strategy, helping to optimize molecular aggregation and crystallization. Moreover, the addition of a second FREA as a third component in binary OSCs provides large potential for optimizing single-junction devices upon following these material-screening rules: (i) matching the absorption/energy levels of the three OPMs in blends, (ii) ensuring the complementarity of the photovoltaic parameters of the two individual binary OSCs; and (ii) ensuring good compatibility between the two FREAs. PC71BM and PC61BM have been demonstrated to be either good third components or solid processing aids for constructing efficient charge transport networks and improving blend morphologies. For strong crystalline FREAs, device processing using mixed solvents or hot substrate spin-coating is effective at synchronizing the crystallization processes of the donor and acceptor to form suitable domain sizes and phase separation, offsetting the intrinsic defects in the active layers and allowing highly-efficient OSCs.
The DTP unit features strong electron-donating abilities, rich interaction sites with metal cations, versatile chemistry, and cost-effective synthesis, rendering it as an ideal block in the design of dopant-free HTMs. The performance breakthrough (PCE: >21%) in PVSCs brought about by the use of our developed dopant-free DTP-core HTMs will inspire more researchers in the pursuit of stable and efficient photovoltaic technologies (e.g. CdSe).95 The strategy of introducing a π-bridge (e.g. thiophene) for conjugation extension can effectively not only modulate energy levels and charge distribution over the planar core and side arms for high hole extraction and mobility levels, but can also improve the glass-transition temperature and interactions with the perovskite. The facile N-alkylation of DTP and the construction of multiple donating arms using π-bridge units can be used to fine-tune the solubility, crystallinity, thermal stability, and film-forming capabilities of HTMs. The design of 2D conjugated DTP HTMs can promote efficient intermolecular charge transfer and long-term device stability. Excitingly, these dopant-free HTM-based PVSCs have outperformed counterparts that use state-of-the-art spiro-OMeTAD fully doped HTMs. Combining the reduced synthesis costs and thin-film abilities of dopant-free HTMs, their use in PVSCs will open up a new era of development and additional practical applications.
Through analysis of the molecular design ideas summarized above, the development of DTP-based OPMs is summarized and some guidelines can be proposed. In terms of OSCs, the state-of-the-art Y6 series of FREA-based devices have outstanding performance, with PCEs of over 18%. In comparison, OSCs containing DTP-based acceptors have significantly inferior JSC values, and thus poorer device properties, which has directed us to firstly develop low bandgap acceptors. Replacing more electron-deficient end-groups is a possible strategy to enhance ICT effects to obtain high JSC values. However, the introduction of electron-deficient groups can easily cause the acceptor LUMO energy level to become downshifted, which reminds us that selecting a donor with a low-lying HOMO is crucial to maintain high VOC values. Besides, some DTP derivatives can also be used as building blocks in low bandgap acceptor designs to extend the backbone conjugation length, thus obtaining narrow Eoptg values for enhanced JSC. To further absorb solar photons, the introduction of a third component could be a good choice to make up for the deficiencies of binary devices. Ternary OSCs typically have relatively complete absorption, and the addition of a compatible third component will improve the morphology of the blended film and promote the formation of a nanofiber-like bimolecular charge transport network for optimized device properties. Secondly, the morphology of the blended film is a key factor influencing charge transport and exciton dissociation at the D/A interface, resulting in uncertain device properties. In some DTP-based acceptors, such as INPIC-4F, it is easy to induce strong crystallization, which can limit further performance improvements. Increasing the alkyl chain length or using some other device technologies can overcome issues relating to the solubility and excessive crystallization of DTP-based acceptors to a certain extent for performance optimization. In addition, asymmetric design strategies can also be used to adjust the crystallinity through reducing the conjugation length on one side of the D core, as a larger dipole moment can promote charge transport. The 15% PCE of asymmetric DTP-containing-acceptor-based OSCs (comparable to original Y6-based devices) illustrates the potential of DTP units for asymmetric design, and the molecular engineering of asymmetric DTP-containing molecules is a hopeful direction in the future for obtaining high-performance acceptors. Thirdly, apart from PCEs, stability is an urgent problem that needs to be solved before commercial applications can be realized. It can be noted that N-functionalized 2D side chain based materials endow corresponding devices with excellent thermal or light-soaking stability,19,20 and this can even be observed in PVSCs. The high morphology retention induced by 2D side chains may be a new idea for utilizing molecular engineering to manipulate stability.
For PVSCs, firstly, since pristine spiro-OMeTAD suffers from low hole mobility, the introduction of dopants can greatly increase the hole mobility but can cause the stability of PVSCs to decrease at the same time. As such, it is of great importance to improve the hole mobilities of dopant-free HTMs. Many effective strategies that work well for achieving high mobilities in OSCs can be introduced to HTMs, such as introducing donors and acceptors, expanding conjugation, and enhancing planarity. Secondly, the hole extraction and transport processes are crucial for achieving efficient PVSCs, and a HTM with a slightly higher HOMO level than that of the perovskite is guaranteed to support efficient hole extraction. The existence of multiple active sites endows DTP with adjustable energy level flexibility, which means that DTP-based PVSCs still have exploration potential. Although huge efforts have resulted in breakthrough PVSC PCE developments from 3.9% to over 25%,96 the serious stability issues caused by dopants have severely limited their real-world applications. However, inorganic materials can be ideal dopant-free HTMs due to their attractive properties, such as high stability, low cost, and high charge-carrier mobility. Organometallic HTMs have demonstrated good stability under thermal and photochemical stress. Organometallic HTMs generally employ phthalocyanines or porphyrin cores to form complexes with divalent metal cations, such as Cu2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Zn2+, etc. The introduction of similar cations into DTP systems may greatly improve their stabilities toward environmental and photothermal stress.
The principles used in the molecular design of DTP-based materials and device engineering for high-efficiency solar cells will provide insight into the future development of new organic semiconducting materials for various optoelectronic applications.
