The highest occupied molecular orbit (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbit (LUMO) of the polythiophene film are determined as −5.20 eV and −3.12 eV, respectively, which match well with that of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite material. In addition, a promising power conversion efficiency of 11.8%, featuring a high fill factor of 0.707, good open voltage of 1.03 V and short current density of 16.2 mA cm−2, has been obtained, which renders polythiophene as an effective competitor to spiro-OMeTAD in perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, this work provides a simple, prompt, controllable and economic approach for the preparation of hole-transporting layer, which would undoubtedly yield new insight into the industrial production of perovskite solar cells.
Introduction
In the past few years, CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite has been proven to be a remarkable light harvester and hole conductor in the hybrid perovskite solar cells.1–7 Particularly, it was found that the perovskite solar cells based on a mesoporous titanium dioxide scaffold can achieve a power conversation efficiency (PCE) as high as 15.4%, using CH3NH3PbI3 as the light-absorption layer and spiro-OMeTAD as the hole conductor.5 Subsequently, a developed ZnO nanoparticle electron-transporting layer for CH3NH3PbI3-based solar cells, without a mesoporous scaffold and any high temperature processing steps, has achieved PCE as high as 15.7%.7 These encouraging improvements led us in believing that the efficiencies of optimized perovskite solar cell up to 20% are realistically achievable, if properly optimized.8,9 Therefore, in addition to further exploring new, more excellent perovskite materials,10–13 much research is now focusing on the design of new device structures,7,14–16 hole16–25 and electron transporting7,26 layers to improve the performance of perovskite-based solar cells and reduce their cost for practical production.
As mentioned above, it has been demonstrated that spiro-OMeTAD is an effective small-molecule hole-transporting material (HTM) for perovskite solar cells. However, the extensive synthetic processes of spiro-OMeTAD molecule would be a big obstacle for large-scale operations in future. Meanwhile, several conducting polymers, such as P3HT,18,19,21 PEDOT:PSS14,22,23 and poly-(triarylamine),15,27 as well as some small molecules such as pyrene-core arylamine derivatives17 and CuI,20 have been used as HTM in perovskite-based solar cells. Recently, the conventional P3HT has been used as the hole conductor in (CH3NH3PbI3−xClx)/TiO2 or CH3NH3PbI2Cl/TiO2 perovskite-based solar cells attaining 6.7% (ref. 19) and 10.8% (ref. 21) PCE, respectively. Using the PCBM as the electron conductor, PEDOT:PSS has been also used as the hole conductor in an inverted structure of CH3NH3PbI3 (ref. 14) and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx (ref. 22) perovskite-based solar cells, giving 3.9% and 11.8% PCE, respectively. When pyrene-core arylamine derivatives17 and CuI20 were used as the hole conductor in the CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 perovskite-based solar cells, 12.4% and 6.0% PCE, respectively, were attained. Unfortunately, the commercial P3HT and PEDOT:PSS with the desired quality is relatively expensive and the synthetic procedures of the pyrene-core arylamine derivatives are also complex, whereas the devices based on CuI as the hole conductor displayed a relatively low PCE. In general, the high cost of HTM and/or low performance in the device hinders the advancement of cost-effective and practical perovskite-based solar cells. To facilitate the industrialization of hybrid perovskite-based solar cells, it is essential to develop an economic HTM as a benign alternative to spiro-OMeTAD, while retaining high PCE.
Polythiophene or its derivatives, such as P3HT are conventionally used as optical absorption layer in organic solar cells. In fact, polythiophene is known to be a good p-type semiconductor (hole-conductor), which has been widely studied due to its high crystallinity, conductivity, charge mobility and relative air stability under operation.28,29 The HOMO energy level of polythiophene via electrochemical polymerization has been reported as ∼−5.20 eV,30 almost same as that of spiro-OMeTAD, which makes it feasible as an alternative to spiro-OMeTAD.
Herein, we report that an HTM, polythiophene prepared via electrochemical polymerization, was successfully used in perovskite-based solar cells. Additionally, a promising power conversion efficiency of 11.8% was obtained in an inverted structure device, ITO/polythiophene/CH3NH3PbI3/C60/BCP/Ag.
Experimental
Materials and methods
Thiophene and BF3Et2O were purchased from J&K. PbI2, C60 and BCP were purchased from Alfa Aesar and Ag was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 24 Ω sq−1 were purchased from CSG Holding Co., Ltd. Thiophene and BF3Et2O were purified by distillation prior to use. PdI2, C60 and BCP were purified by vacuum sublimation. CH3NH3I was synthesized according to literature procedures7 and recrystallized prior to use. Cyclic voltammograms were obtained in dichloromethane (1 × 10−3 M) using tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) (0.1 M) as the supporting electrolyte at scan rate of 0.1 V s−1 and Fc/Fc+ as the internal reference during the measurement. HOMO and LUMO energy levels were estimated relative to the energy level of a ferrocene reference (4.8 eV below vacuum level). UV-vis spectra and the optical transmittance were obtained with a JASCO V-570 spectrophotometer. The work function of polythiophene film was measured by an ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (Ac-2, Riken Keiki). The in-plane conductivity of polythiophene films obtained was measured using a standard four probe method with an Ag contact. For the out-plane conductivity of the films, a two-probe method was used. XRD experiments were performed on a Rigaku D/max-2500 X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation at a generator voltage of 40 kV and a current of 100 mA. Atomic force microscope (AFM) investigation was performed using SPA 400 in the “tapping” mode. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) investigation was carried out on an SEM Hitachi S-4800 microscope. Film thicknesses were measured using a KLA-Tencor Alpha-Step IQ.
Synthesis of the polythiophene film
Polythiophene films were synthesized in a one compartment cell under computer control in a three-electrode test system. The working electrode was an ITO glass substrate (0.5 cm × 2.2 cm), and the counter electrode was platinum wires placed 0.5 cm apart, while an Ag/AgCl electrode was used as reference electrode. The electrolyte solution was freshly distilled boron trifluoride-diethyl etherate (BFEE) containing 30 mM thiophene. All solutions were degassed with a stream of dry argon, and a slight overpressure was maintained during each experiment. The films were grown at +1.30 V. After polymerization, the films were thoroughly rinsed with diethyl ether and ethanol and then dried by nitrogen flow. The thickness of the polythiophene films can be modulated by controlling polymerization time.
Device fabrication and photovoltaic characterization
Solar cells were fabricated on pre-cleaned ITO-coated glass substrates. First, a thin polythiophene layer (5–36 nm) was deposited on ITO-coated glass by electrochemical polymerization. Then, the polythiophene films were infiltrated with PbI2 by spin coating a PbI2 solution in DMF (462 mg mL−1, at 70 °C). After drying, the films were dipped in CH3NH3I solution in 2-propanol (10 mg mL−1) at 70 °C for 90 s and rinsed with 2-propanol. After drying, C60 (30 nm)/BCP (10 nm) was sequentially deposited under high vacuum. Finally, Ag (150 nm) was thermally evaporated on top of the device to form the back contact.
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of photovoltaic devices were obtained by a Keithley 4200 source-measure unit. The photocurrent was measured under illumination-simulated 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G irradiation using a xenon-lamp-based solar simulator [Oriel 300 W solar simulator (Thermo Oriel 91160-1000)] in air. Simulator irradiance was calibrated using a certified silicon diode, as determined by a standard silicon solar cell. The effective area of the cell was defined as 0.14 cm2 using a non-reflective photo-mask. IPCE was recorded on Keithley 2400 source meter under irradiation of a 150 W tungsten lamp with a 1/4 m monochromator (Spectral Product DK240).
Results and discussion
The growing of polythiophene films was conducted at +1.30 V in a three-electrode test system.28 When BFEE was employed as the supporting electrolyte, the oxidation potential can be substantially lowered; therefore, damage to the integrity of the conjugated molecular structure of the film could be avoided, and the effective conjugation length of the polythiophene material should increase. In addition, because no substitute is present on the thiophene ring, the inter-chain packing of the polythiophene material should be significantly improved, ultimately affording compact thin films with high conductivity.28 The room temperature in-plane conductivity of polythiophene film obtained varied from 500 to 1200 S cm−1. The optimal thickness with best device performance is 18 nm, for which the in-plane conductivity was ∼800 S cm−1 and out-plane conductivity was ∼0.0006 S cm−1. These results are consistent with those reported using the same polymerized method and conditions.28–30
To determine the energy level of obtained polythiophene films, the electrochemical property of them were investigated with the cyclic voltammetry (CV) as shown in Fig. 1A. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the polythiophene were calculated from the onset oxidation and reduction potential, which were −5.20 and −3.12 eV, respectively. The HOMO value of polythiophene is almost consistent with its work function, −5.24 eV, as measured by UPS (Fig. S1†). The obtained results are similar to that reported in the literature.31 Especially, the energy level of HOMO is almost same as that of spiro-OMeTAD, −5.22 eV.

Since the HOMO level (−5.20 eV) of polythiophene is very close to the HOMO level (−5.30 eV) of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite, it facilitates the hole transfer to ITO electrode through polythiophene. The relatively high-lying LUMO (−3.12 eV) of polythiophene compared with that of the LUMO (−3.90) of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite prevents the electron transfer from/through the perovskite layer to the ITO electrode. Therefore, this confirms that electrochemical polymerized polythiophene is possible as an intriguing alternative to spiro-OMeTAD as the hole conductor in CH3NH3PbI3-based perovskite solar cells.
Polythiophene films show main absorption between 400–600 nm, with an absorption maximum at ∼530 nm (Fig. S2†). It can be seen in Fig. 1B that the transmittance of polythiophene film with 18 nm thickness at 530 nm is about 78%, meaning that about 22% of the light at this wavelength has been absorbed or reflected before passing through the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer. Ideally, the impact of the light-absorbing polythiophene film on the device performance can be significantly reduced by maintaining polythiophene films in a very thin range.
Fig. 2 illustrates the device architecture used in this work and the energy levels of each layer in the device. As shown in Fig. 2A, the device consists of ITO/glass as the positive electrode, a polythiophene (5–36 nm) film as the hole-transporting layer, CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite (250 ± 20 nm)/C60 (30 nm) films as the active layers, a thin BCP film (10 nm) as the electron-transporting layer, and Ag (150 nm) as the negative electrode. Polythiophene film is directly coated onto the ITO substrate by electrochemical polymerization to produce a very compact layer. A sequential deposition process was then used to grow the CH3NH3PbI3 layer.2 Due to high wettability and compatibility of the polythiophene film surface with the PbI2 solution of DMF, a layer of PbI2 is well formed via spin coating onto polythiophene film, followed by immersion of the substrate in a CH3NH3I solution of 2-propanol. According to the relative energy levels of each layer of the device in Fig. 2B, free charge carriers (or excitons) generated in the CH3NH3PbI3 layer can be extracted (or dissociated) either by transferring holes to the polythiophene layer or transferring electrons to the C60 (acceptor) layer, which tends to attain high charge collection efficiencies on both electrodes.14,27

The crystalline structure of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film prepared by the above-mentioned method on the polythiophene/ITO/glass substrate was characterized by glancing angle X-ray diffraction (GAXRD). The GAXRD patterns illustrated in Fig. 3 agree well with previously published results.2,5,14 The main diffraction peaks, assigned to the 110, 220 and 330 peaks at 14°, 24° and 43°, respectively, are in identical positions with those reported in the literatures, which clearly indicates that this two-step solution process technique is an effective method to produce the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite featuring an orthorhombic crystal structure.2,14 Notably, in the region of the (110) diffraction peak, there is only a small signature of a peak at 12.6° [the (001) diffraction peak for PbI2], indicating a high level of phase purity.

Theoretically, the interface between the perovskite layer and the hole-transporting material directly affects the short circuit current density (Jsc) and fill fact (FF). Thus, the morphologies of the mainly functional layers of the ITO/polythiophene/CH3NH3PbI3/C60/BCP/Ag devices were investigated by AFM (Fig. 4A and B) and SEM (Fig. 4C–E). As shown in Fig. 4A, it appears that the polythiophene film (18 nm) is quite compact, with little surface roughness (2.7 nm) and no porosity visible. The polythiophene on the ITO/glass substrate has a smooth and reflective topography when viewed by the naked eye, which would certainly offer an excellent basis for the fabrication of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film by the solution process. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 4B, the surface of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer on the polythiophene/ITO glass is also smooth and homogeneous, with surface roughness (52.8 nm). The SEM image of CH3NH3PbI3 layer on the polythiophene/ITO glass (Fig. 4C and D) clearly indicates the formation of large crystallites (50–200 nm) of CH3NH3PbI3. The cross-section of the solution processed perovskite film appear to be sufficiently smooth; notably, it is still within a single ‘platelet’ and has a slight undulating nature within a relatively large area, with film thickness ranging from 200 to 300 nm (Fig. 4E).

The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics and incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectrum of the best performing device with 18 nm thickness of polythiophene as hole-transporting layer are shown in Fig. 5A and B, respectively. The J–V curve exhibits the best performance with Voc (1.03 V), Jsc (16.2 mA cm−2), and FF (0.707), corresponding to a PCE of 11.8% under standard 1 sun AM 1.5 simulated solar irradiation. Encouragingly, we occasionally obtained a device with Voc (1.03 V), Jsc (20.14 mA cm−2), and FF (0.637), corresponding to a PCE of 13.2%, indicating that the device has great potential for further optimization.

(B) IPCE spectrum of the highest performing glass/ITO/PT(polythiophene)/CH3NH3PbI3/C60/BCP/Ag device; the spectrum inserted is the absorbance of the CH3NH3PbI3 (250 nm)/PT (18 nm)/ITO/glass. 
As shown in Fig. 5B, the IPCE spectrum shows a spectral response in the region from the UV-visible to near infrared (300–800 nm). It shows a slight lower IPCE, from 400 to 600 nm, than that reported in the literature,27 and the IPCE between 400 and 530 nm is only around 60%. This is coincident with the lower transmittance between 400 and 600 nm of the polythiophene layer, implying that the light absorbed by the polythiophene film makes little contribution to the Jsc. However, between 600 and 800 nm, the value of IPCE is maintained as high as 70%, which conforms to the behavior for a high-performance device based on CH3NH3PbI3. The inset shows the absorbance curve of CH3NH3PbI3 (250 nm)/PT (18 nm)/ITO/glass, suggesting that the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite has made predominate contribution to the light absorption and shown a typical absorption pattern between 300–800 nm, as reported in the literature.1
To probe the effect of the polythiophene layer thickness on device performance, the devices were prepared by changing the thickness (5–36 nm) of the polythiophene layer (Table 1). As can be seen from the data, incorporating even a very thin (∼5 nm) polythiophene layer into the device, a medium Voc of ∼0.96 V, a low FF of ∼44%, and a high Jsc of ∼21 mA cm−2 were obtained. With the increase in the thickness of the polythiophene layer, the Jsc of the devices decreased, while the FF increased significantly, at same time with a small increase of the Voc. When the thickness of the layer is ∼18 nm, the devices with highest conversion efficiency (∼11.8%) were obtained with the Voc as high as 1.03 V. Then, further improving the thickness of the polythiophene layer beyond 36 nm, the overall performance of the devices dropped, due to the big drop in Jsc, although the fill factors were still retained at a good level. Therefore, we could deduce that the optimal thickness of the polythiophene film as the hole-transporting layer was about 16–20 nm under the polymerization conditions we used. We assumed that this phenomenon resulted from the polythiophene layer having excellent hole-transporting capability and the energy levels matching well with those of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite; thus, when the polythiophene layer was inserted into the device, the solar cell shows a good conversion efficiency. The improvement of device performance, using relatively thick polythiophene films (16–28 nm), is basically attributable to the increase in FF. As a matter of fact, Rsh and Rs play a significant part in FF, which is one of the most important factors affecting the performance of devices.32 An increase of Rsh, a decrease of Rs, or both is essential to achieving a high FF. However, when the polythiophene film is too thin (≤13 nm), the ITO electrode could not be entirely covered with the polythiophene film under present polymerization conditions. This easily induces some leakage paths from active layer to bare ITO, resulting in small Rsh and a larger leakage current, so the relatively small fill factors are attained.30 While the thin polythiophene film has lower light absorbance ability and higher transmittance, it is favorable to obtain the higher Jsc. Therefore, there will be plenty of room for improving the PCE of devices through controlling the morphology of the surface of polythiophene (hole conductor) layer along with 5–10 nm thin film thickness or more thinner, which we are now actively pursuing.

The reproducibility of the device fabrication procedure and the relatively high PCEs are highly encouraging. The average results of our devices in Table 1 (PCE 11.1%) is substantially higher than the (CH3NH3PbI3−xClx)/TiO2 solar cell using P3HT as hole conductor with a PCE of 10.4%.21 In addition, the highest value of Voc (1.03 V), Jsc (21.4 mA cm−2) and FF (0.707) we obtained in different devices for the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite/C60 solar cell are comparable to those of the best CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 heterojunction solar cell fabricated by vapour-deposited (1.07 V, 21.5 mA cm−2, 0.670, 15.4%).5 Moreover, our values are comparable to the planar ZnO/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD perovskite solar cells with Voc (1.03 V), Jsc (20.4 mA cm−2), FF (0.749) and PCE (15.7%).7 Therefore, if the best value of Voc (1.03 V), Jsc (21.4 mA cm−2) and FF (0.707) are combined in one device, PCE as high as 15.6% is expected through further optimization. Our results confirm that it is very feasible to produce planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells with electrochemically polymerized polythiophene film as the hole-transporting layer, although placed in front of the light absorption layer.
To confirm the reliability and reproducibility of these devices, over 100 separate solar cells have been assembled and examined, in which the polythiophene film was found to have an optimal thickness of ∼18 nm. To describe the characteristics of cell-performance, the histogram of device parameters was constructed. As shown in Fig. 6, it appears that these devices have exhibited excellent photovoltaic performance with remarkable reproducibility. Specifically, values of Voc are highly reproducible at about 1.03 V, and the average value of Jsc and FF is around 17 mA cm−2 and 65%, respectively.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we first used a thin polythiophene film prepared via electrochemical polymerization as the hole-transporting layer in a CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cell. Despite the polythiophene layer absorbing a small part of visible irradiation, the optimized devices with 18 nm thickness of the polythiophene film have shown a good average FF of ∼0.65, Jsc of ∼16 mA cm−2, Voc of ∼1.01 V and PCE of ∼11.1%. Under the optimized conditions, the best device was obtained with Voc of 1.03 V, Jsc of 16.2 mA cm−2, FF of 0.707 and PCE of 11.8%. The high performance of polythiophene as hole-transporting layer seems to originate from: (1) the energy levels of the polythiophene films with HOMO of ∼−5.20 eV, match well with HOMO of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite, ∼−5.40 eV; (2) the high hole conductivity of the polythiophene films; and (3) the polythiophene film shows excellent wettability and compatibility with the PbI2 solution of DMF, therefore leading to a good contact between the two layers. Based on these results, we demonstrated that the polythiophene film prepared via electrochemical polymerization is an effective hole conductor in perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, using electrochemical polymerization to fabricate the thin polythiophene film is a simple, economic and controllable method, which should yield new insight into the industrial production of perovskite solar cells.
