, Accepted 25th August 2015First published on 2nd September 2015AbstractWe have significantly enhanced the power conversion efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells based on TiO2 nanotube membranes by increasing the inner surface area of the channels. Onion type carbon materials (OTCMs) were produced by injecting ethylene gas continuously into the Ar plasma of a thermal plasma system. The average size was about 20 nm. OTCMs were functionalized by treatment with sulfuric and nitric acids. Functionalized OTCMs were chemisorbed on the inner surface of the channels by spontaneous diffusion. To maximize filling, we vacuum-filled functionalized OTCMs and TiCl4 into the channels of TiO2 nanotube membranes in sequence, and then sintered at 500 °C. When being sintered, TiCl4 transformed to TiO2, while the carbon materials burnt. By filling OTCMs and TiCl4 in sequence and sintering, the inner surface became very rough, and the amount of dye adsorbed on the photoanode was increased about 50%. The electron lifetime and effective carrier diffusion length were increased by filling with functionalized OTCMs and TiCl4 in sequence. The power conversion efficiency of the DSSC based on TiO2 nanotube membranes was improved from 6.99 to 9.33%, a 33.5% enhancement. The efficiency enhancement is mainly due to an increase in the total available surface area for dye adsorption.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have received much attention because of their promising low cost and high power conversion efficiency.1–4 In the fabrication of DSSCs, mesoporous TiO2 films and ruthenium sensitizers have been used as the main component materials. TiO2 nanoparticles are mostly used as electron acceptors for DSSCs.5–7 Nanoparticles are basically spherical and zero-dimensional. For equal volumes, zero-dimensional materials generally have a larger surface area than one- or more dimensional materials. Therefore, more dye molecules could be adsorbed on the surface of zero-dimensional materials. However, nanoparticles are networked randomly and have grain boundary effects, both of which are critical limitations in electron transport. In electron transport, TiO2 nanotube arrays are more advantageous than TiO2 nanoparticles since the nanotubes are one-dimensional materials, while the nanoparticles are zero-dimensional ones. TiO2 nanotube arrays have been used in fabrication of DSSCs.8–24 It is known that the electron transport is hindered considerably by the barrier layer of TiO2 nanotubes.25 However, the barrier layer could be removed simply by applying a relatively high voltage at the end of anodization.26 In this case, TiO2 nanotube arrays become membranes. Although TiO2 nanotubes have better electron transport properties than TiO2 nanoparticles, they have significantly less available surface area for dyes than the nanoparticles do. The volume fraction occupied by the channels of TiO2 nanotube membranes is relatively large as about 56%,25 which could reduce the available surface area for dye adsorption. Several methods have been tried to increase the available surface area for dye adsorption such as treating with TiCl4,27 electrophoresis of TiO2 nanoparticles into the micro-cracks formed in TiO2 nanotube arrays,28 and filling of the channels of TiO2 nanotube membrane with TiO2 nanoparticles by vacuum filtering.29 By treating with TiCl4, the roughness of the inner surface of the TiO2 nanotubes might be increased because TiCl4 might be filled into the channels and transformed to TiO2 when being sintered. The filling of the channels with TiO2 nanoparticles is a direct method to increase the available surface area. However, in the vacuum filtering method, aggregation of TiO2 nanoparticles was a serious problem. When the filtering time was relatively long, the mouth of the channels was blocked by TiO2 nanoparticles aggregated. Here, we have increased the inner surface area of the channels of TiO2 nanotube membranes for dye adsorption by vacuum-assisted filling of the channels with functionalized onion type carbon materials (OTCMs) (about 20 nm in diameter) and TiCl4 in sequence, and then by sintering (see Scheme 1). By filling OTCMs and TiCl4 in sequence and sintering, the inner surface became very rough, and the amount of dye adsorbed on the photoanode was increased about 50%. The power conversion efficiency of the dye-sensitized solar cells based on TiO2 nanotube membranes was increased significantly from 6.99% to 9.33%, a 33.5% enhancement.

Experimental
Fabrication of TiO2 nanotube membranes
TiO2 nanotube arrays were fabricated by anodizing thin Ti foils (99.7% purity, Alfa Aesar, 2.5 cm × 3.5 cm × 100 μm) in an electrolyte solution composed of 0.8 wt% of NH4F and 2 vol% of H2O in ethylene glycol at 25 °C and at a constant applied voltage of 60 V DC for 2 h.10 At the end of the second anodization, a larger anodic voltage (about 140 V DC) was applied for 20 s, and then annealed at 300 °C for 1 h under an ambient atmosphere. To detach the membrane from the Ti foil, a second anodization was done at a constant applied voltage of 30 V DC for 2 or 3 min, and then dissolved in a H2O2 solution for 30 min.
Fabrication and functionalization of OTCMs
Carbon soot consisted of OTCMs and graphene quantum dots were fabricated using the reported thermal plasma jet method.30,31 Ethylene gas was injected continuously at a rate of 2.5 l min−1 into Ar plasma and a carbon tube (20 cm in length) was attached to the anode. When carbon soot was dispersed in ethanol under a mild stirring condition, OTCMs were not dispersed, while graphene quantum dots were dissolved. OTCMs were obtained after decanting the dispersed solution. OTCMs were functionalized using the reported method.32 20 mg of OTCMs were dispersed in H2SO4 (30 ml) by stirring for 24 h at 25 °C. 7 ml of H2SO4 and HNO3 (60%, 13 ml) was added into the OTCM-dispersed solution in ice bath. After 10 min, the solution was heated to 85 °C for 30 min with stirring. The dispersion was transferred into 150 ml of D.I water and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 20 min. The centrifugate was redispersed in D.I water and recentrifuged. The centrifugate was resuspended in ethanol (150 ml) by sonication.
Fabrication of DSSCs
A TiO2 blocking layer was formed on washed FTO glass by spin-coating with 5 wt% of titanium di-isopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) in butanol, and then annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. The viscous TiO2 nanoparticle paste was printed onto the FTO glass formed a TiO2 blocking layer by the doctor blade technique, and then attached the TiO2 membrane to the FTO glass under slight pressure, and then sintered at 500 °C for 1 h.
The dispersed solution of functionalized OTCMs was vacuum-filled in the channels of TiO2 nanotube membrane attached on the FTO glass. After drying, a 0.7 M TiCl4 aqueous solution was vacuum-filled in the channels for several times. After each filling, it was sintered at 100 °C for 10 min. After the final filling, it was sintered at 500 °C for 1 h.
Dye molecules (Solaronix, N719) were adsorbed by immersing the photoanode in the 0.5 mM ethanol dye solution. The electrolyte solution was prepared by the reported recipe.33 The electrolyte solution was prepared as follows: 0.7 M 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium iodide (BMII), 0.03 M I2, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GSCN), and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in a mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15 v/v). The counter-electrode was prepared by dropping H2PtCl6 solution in ethanol on FTO glass and sandwiched by using a 60 μm thick hot-melt spacer.
Characterization of carbon materials and DSSCs
Carbon materials were analyzed by using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (JEOL, JEM-3000F (300 kV)), and the solar cell structure and TiO2 nanotube membranes by a scanning electron microscope (SEM; JEOL, JSM-6700F (10 kV)). Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSCs were measured using an electrometer (KEITHLEY 2400) under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2) provided by a solar simulator (1 kW xenon with AM 1.5 filter, Peccel Technologies, PEC-L01). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using McScience (model K3100) with reference to the calibrated diode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out with a potentiostat (Solartron 1287) equipped with a frequency response analyzer (Solartron 1260), with the frequency ranging from 10−1 to 105 Hz. The applied bias voltage and ac amplitude were set at open circuit voltage (Voc) of the DSSCs and 10 mV, respectively. The impedance measurements were carried out at open-circuit potential under one-sun light illumination.
Results and discussion
Fig. 1 shows the low and high magnification TEM images of OTCMs. The insert is the picture of functionalized OTCMs dispersion in ethanol by sonication. In the high resolution image, an onion type carbon material having contour-like fringes is observed. The average size of OTCMs is about 20 nm. OTCMs and functionalized OTCMs were dispersed in ethanol by sonication, and these dispersed solutions were very stable for several months. Carbon soot fabricated by the reported method consists of mainly OTCMs and about 10% of graphene quantum dots.30 OTCMs were burnt in air at 500 °C, which was the sintering temperature, while graphene quantum dots were not. Due to this reason, we have removed graphene quantum dots from carbon soot. When carbon soot was dispersed in ethanol by stirring with a stirring rod, only graphene quantum dots were dispersed. To get relatively pure OTCMs, we just decanted the dispersed solution.

Fig. 2 shows SEM images of the top and bottom surfaces of a TiO2 nanotube membrane. The average size of the top mouths is about 100 nm, which is significantly larger than that of the bottom ones, about 80 nm. This is due to the pore widening during anodization. The thickness of the membrane was about 15 μm. In the bottom surface view (see Fig. 2b), one can see that all the tube bottoms are opened. It is known that when a high voltage is applied at the end of anodization, TiO2 nanotube bottoms are opened, and the membrane is separated completely from the Ti foil.26 However, TiO2 nanotube membranes not annealed at a relatively high temperature was very soft and hard to handle. To overcome this problem, we applied a medium voltage (140 V DC) at the end of anodization. This voltage was enough to open the tubes bottoms but the membrane was scarcely attached on the Ti foil. We annealed the foil at 300 °C for 1 h, and then did the second anodization for 3 min, and then etched in a 33% H2O2 solution to detach the membrane. TiO2 nanotubes were dissolved in H2O2 solution but after annealing they were hardly dissolved.

In Fig. 2b, the tips look like to consist of two layers with different tube size. To open the tube ends, we have changed abruptly the applied voltage from 60 to 140 V DC at the end of anodization. It is known that when a high voltage is applied abruptly, several tubes having relatively small diameters are made simultaneously at the end of each tube.26 Since they are formed perpendicularly to the hemisphere of the tube end, they have some angles larger than 90 degree with respect to the tube axis. When the diameters of these small diameter tubes are increased, they are merging each other, and consequently the end of each tube is opened. In this case, the inner part of the tube bottom is cut more deeply than the outer part due to a larger angle than 90 degree. Consequently, the inner surface of the open tips has a funnel shape. The top edges may scatter electrons more efficiently than the lower parts having some angle, and they are seen more brightly. Due to a different contrast, the bottom tips could be seen to consist of two layers with different tube size. However, we believe that this peculiar shape did not influence on device performance because the membrane was attached using a viscous TiO2 nanoparticle paste. In this case, some paste might be entered into the bottom channels, and the bottom of the membrane might be physically and electrically attached to the transparent electrode through the paste.
Fig. 3 shows the side views of TiO2 nanotube membranes being cut. The pristine inner surface of the channels is very smooth. For being filled with OTCMs, they are adsorbed on the inner surface like dots. For being filled with OTCMs and TiCl4, in sequence, and then sintered, the surface became very rough by being formed relatively large bumps or bump bands on the inner surface. TiCl4 is changed to TiO2 by sintering, while OTCMs are burnt out. Consequently, the inner surface area of the channels of TiO2 nanotube membranes might be increased significantly by being filled with OTCMs and TiCl4, in sequence, and then sintered. In Table 1, the amount of dye adsorbed by three different photoanodes is summarized. The amount of dye adsorbed by each photoanode was determined from the UV-Vis absorbance spectra of the desorbed dye into 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution. The amount of adsorbed dye was increased from 121 to 182 nmol cm−2, a 50% increment, by filling OTCMs and TiCl4 in sequence and then sintering.

Fig. 4 shows the side view of a TiO2 nanotube membrane attached to FTO glass using TiO2 paste. In the side view, there are four layers. The layers from top to bottom are the TiO2 nanotube membrane, paste layer of TiO2 nanoparticles, TiO2 blocking layer, and FTO layer. The thicknesses of the membrane, paste layer and blocking later are approximately 15 μm, 3 μm, and 700 nm, respectively.

Fig. 5 presents the photocurrent–voltage curves measured in air mass 1.5 sunlight. We fabricated three different DSSCs based on TiO2 nanotube membranes attached to FTO glass using TiO2 paste: (i) without filling, (ii) with filling the channels with only TiCl4, (iii) with filling with functionalized OTCMs and TiCl4 in sequence. The values of an open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (η) for these cells measured by a front-side illumination are summarized in Table 2. For the DSSC based on only a paste layer of TiO2 nanocrystals (i.e. without an attached membrane), the power conversion efficiency was 2.0%. For the DSSC based on a TiO2 membrane attached to FTO glass, without filling, the power conversion efficiency was 6.99%. By being filled with only TiCl4 and then being sintered, the efficiency improved from 6.99% to 8.14%, corresponding to 16.5% enhancement. By being filled with functionalized OTCMs and TiCl4, in sequence, and then being sintered, the power conversion efficiency improved significantly from 6.99% to 9.33%, corresponding to 33.5% enhancement. Jsc was increased from 13.04 to 18.65 mA cm−2, a 43% increment and Voc was slightly increased from 755 to 795 mV, a 5% enhancement, while FF was decreased significantly from 71.0 to 63.0%, an 11.3% decrement. Since Jsc is directly proportional to the number of dye molecules adsorbed, it is concluded that the efficiency enhancement is mainly due to an increase in the total available surface area for dye adsorption. Actually, the amount of adsorbed dye was increased about 50% by filling OTCMs and TiCl4 in sequence and then sintering (see Table 1). A slight increase of Voc may be due to the significant increase of Jsc.34 The fill factor is affected by the internal resistance in DSSC. The internal resistance elements are related to the charge transfer processes at Pt counter electrode, the charge transportation at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, diffusion in the electrolyte, and the sheet resistance of transparent conducting oxide.35 By being filled with functionalized OTCMs and TiCl4, in sequence, and then being sintered, the inner surface of the channels became very rough and the diameter of the channels was reduced significantly (see Fig. 3). Therefore, the diffusion of electrolytes might be hindered, and the fill factor might be decreased. The increase of the inner-surface roughness and decrease of the inner-volume of the channels could affect to the scattering of light. For the DSSC prepared by both filling and treatment, the power conversion efficiency was not improved by construction of a scattering layer. However, for the DSSC prepared without filling and treatment, the efficiency is increased by construction of a scattering layer.36 N719 dye, which was used in fabrication of our DSSCs, has almost no absorption in the longer wavelength region than 750 nm. This means that light with wavelengths shorter than 750 nm is almost not reached to the scattering layer for the DSSC prepared by filling OTCMs and TiCl4, in sequence.

The IPCE spectra of our two DSSCs based on TiO2 membranes are shown in Fig. 6. In each spectrum, there are basically two broad bands centered at near 420 and 540 nm. These bands are corresponding to two visible absorption bands of N719 dye centered at 393 and 533 nm. However, the high energy band is significantly red shifted compared to that of N719 dye. This is probably due to two opposite behaviours of the dye absorption and solar intensity in the region between 393 and 450 nm. The dye absorption is decreased, with increasing wavelength from 393 to 450 nm, while solar intensity increases sharply from UV to about 490 nm. Consequently, the λmax might be shifted from 393 to near 420 nm. One of the DSSCs was fabricated without filling, and the other was fabricated by filling the channels with functionalized OTCMs and TiCl4, in sequence. The intensity of the latter is higher than that of the former. Although their intensities are significantly different, both spectra are very similar to each other. This may mean that the filling with functionalized OTCMs and TiCl4 in sequence and then sintering might simply increase the total surface area and that more dyes were adsorbed. A short circuit current may be directly proportional to the number of dye molecules adsorbed. By filling OTCMs and TiCl4 in sequence and then sintering, the amount of dye loaded was actually increased about 50% (see Table 1) and the short circuit current was increased from 13.04 to 18.65 mA cm−2, corresponding to a 43% increment (see Table 2).

Fig. 7 shows the Nyquist (a) and Bode (b) plots of the characteristic electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) for the DSSCs based on TiO2 nanotube membranes prepared without filling, and with filling with functionalized OTCMs and TiCl4, in sequence, followed by sintering. They were recorded in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz. Each spectrum of the Nyquist plot contains three semicircles. The semicircle in the high-frequency region is assign to the parallel combination of the resistance and capacitance at the Pt–FTO/electrolyte and to the interface between FTO and TiO2 layers, while those in the intermediate and low-frequency regions offer information on the resistance and capacitance at the TiO2/electrolyte interface and the Nernst diffusion of the electrolyte, respectively.2 These data were analysed using an equivalent circuit as shown in the inset of Fig. 7 and a nonlinear least square fitting program. The fit parameters are listed in Table 3. Rs was almost not changed, by filling with functionalized OTCMs and TiCl4 in sequence, while the resistances of R1 and R2 were decreased, and R3 was increased somewhat. This may mean that Rs is not affected by filling with functionalized OTCMs and TiCl4 in sequence, while the others are affected. The ohmic series resistance Rs is caused by sheet resistance of FTO, current collector contacts, etc. It corresponds to the value in the x-axis where the first semicircle begins in the left hand side. The resistance R1 is given by the sum of the interfacial resistance of FTO/TiO2 and Pt/electrolyte, while R2 is given by the sum of the charge transfer resistance at dye-absorbed TiO2/electrolyte interface and transport resistance in the TiO2 film.37,38 The resistance R3 is related to the Nernst diffusion of the electrolyte. R3 was increased from 6.99 to 10.3 Ω by filling with functionalized OTCMs and TiCl4 in sequence. This means that the diffusion of electrolytes was hindered somewhat by filling. There is no doubt that the inner diameter would be decreased when the inner surface of the channels was coated with TiCl4, and the diffusion of electrolyte would be hindered.

On Bode plots, the position of the middle frequency (fmid) peak was different from each other. The frequency was 17.4 and 11.9 Hz, respectively, for the DSSCs prepared without filling, and with functionalized OTCMs and TiCl4 filling in sequence. The value of fmid is related to the inverse of the electron lifetime (τ) as follows: τ = 1/(2πfmid).39,40 The calculated electron lifetime was 9.13 and 13.4 ms, respectively. The electron lifetime is also related to the effective carrier diffusion length (Ln) as follows: Ln2 = Deff × τ, where Deff is the effective electron diffusion coefficient and τ is the electron lifetime. Based on the Bisquert model,38 Deff is described as Deff = (Rk/Rw)L2keff.39,40 Where Rk, Rw, L, and keff represent the resistance of charge transfer related to recombination, the resistance of electron transport in the photoanode, the thickness of the photoanode, and the constant of effective rate for recombination, respectively. The values of these parameters can be obtained from the semicircle of middle frequency in Nyquist and Bode plots. Rk is determined from the diameter of the middle semicircle in the Nyquist plot obtained under dark conditions, and Rw is estimated from diameter of the middle semicircle in the Nyquist plot shown in Fig. 7a. The thickness of the photoanode was 18.7 μm. keff is obtained from the maximum peak frequency obtained from the Bode plot in Fig. 7b.40 The calculated values are summarized in Table 4. The calculated value of Ln for the DSSCs prepared without filling, and with functionalized OTCMs and TiCl4 filling in sequence was 27.2 and 33.8 μm, respectively. The results indicate that both the electron lifetime and effective carrier diffusion length are increased by filling with TiCl4 and further increased by filling with functionalized OTCMs and TiCl4 filling in sequence.

Both types of OTCMs, with and without being functionalized, were well dispersed in ethanol by sonication. The dispersed solution was very stable for several months. The good dispersing property is a strong merit in filling the channels with OTCMs. Functionalized OTCMs were filled spontaneously into the channels of TiO2 nanotubes by diffusion. With increasing filling time, the black color due to OTCMs became darker. Functionalized OTCMs could be chemisorbed on the surface of the channels of TiO2 nanotubes. By functionalization, hydroxyl and carboxyl groups would be made on the surface of OTCMs.32 The carboxyl group could react with the hydroxyl group existing on the inner surface of TiO2 nanotube channels, and chemisorption could take place.41 In a spontaneous filling by diffusion, the mouth of the channels was blocked by OTCMs when filling time was relatively long. In a spontaneous filling, the adsorption probability of OTCMs would decrease with increasing the depth of the channels. To make a uniform filling, we did vacuum-assisted filling instead of spontaneous filling by diffusion. The amount of OTCMs filled was controlled roughly by varying the concentration of the dispersed solution of OTCMs. OTCMs might be adsorbed relatively uniformly on whole channels, since a well dispersed solution was filled in whole channels instantaneously by vacuum filling and each OTCM could be chemisorbed on the nearest surface. When a TiCl4 solution was vacuum-filled and then dried, TiCl4 might be deposited and surround adsorbed-OTCMs. When filling with TiCl4 and drying were repeated several times, OTCMs might be surrounded by TiCl4. Depending on the amount of TiCl4 deposited, OTCMs would be embedded in TiCl4 partially or completely. When being sintered, TiCl4 transformed to TiO2 while carbon materials burnt. In this case, new TiO2 surface might be created, particularly, in the areas of OTCMs embedded (see Scheme 1).
Conclusions
We have significantly increased the inner surface area of the channels of TiO2 nanotube membranes by vacuum-assisted filling the channels with functionalized OTCMs and TiCl4, in sequence, and then by sintering. OTCMs were produced by injecting ethylene gas continuously into the Ar plasma of a thermal plasma system, and then functionalized. Functionalized OTCMs are chemisorbed on the inner surface of the channels, since they were filled into the channels of TiO2 nanotube membranes spontaneously by diffusion. TiCl4 transforms to TiO2, by sintering, while carbon materials burns. By filling functionalized OTCMs and TiCl4, in sequence, into the channels of TiO2 nanotube membranes and then sintering, the inner surface became very rough, and the amount of dye adsorbed on the photoanode was increased from 121 to 182 nmol cm−2 a 50% increment. The electron lifetime and effective carrier diffusion length was increased by filling with functionalized OTCMs and TiCl4 filling in sequence. The power conversion efficiency of the DSSC based on TiO2 nanotube membranes was improved from 6.99 to 9.33%, a 33.5% enhancement. The efficiency enhancement is mainly due to an increase in the total available surface area for dye adsorption.
