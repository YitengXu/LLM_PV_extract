    , Accepted 24th March 2017First published on 25th March 2017AbstractOrganic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells have emerged as a promising candidate for next generation solar cells. The most extensively used perovskite absorber is methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3). Defect types and quantities, particularly for the defects involving A-site cation (MA+), appear to have significant influence on material properties and on the solar cell performance. In this report, by introducing a smaller sized potassium cation (K+) into the lattice structure of MAPbI3, the photovoltaic performance of mixed-cation perovskite solar cells was enhanced. X-ray diffraction data indicate that the K+ mainly occupied the interstitial position in the perovskite crystal lattice. Systematic study has demonstrated that there are several benefits of introducing the proper amount of K+ to MAPbI3. The increased crystallinity, red shifted photoluminescence (PL) spectra and decreased surface potential result in eminent carrier separation properties and thus reduce the charge recombination in solar cell devices. The optimized mixing range has been investigated; when 0 ≤ K+ content of x (x is the ratio of K+:Pb2+) ≤ 0.2, the modified mixed perovskite solar cell exhibited better photoelectric conversion efficiencies than that of pristine MAPbI3. Particularly, the perovskite solar cell presents balanced injection capacity for both holes and electrons when x = 0.2, and a conversion efficiency of 19.3% is obtained.
Introduction
Owing to numerous marvellous superiorities, such as extremely long charge lifetime, high absorption coefficient, direct band gap structure, the inorganic–organic lead halogen based perovskite materials have revolutionized the development of emerging photovoltaic technologies.1–5 It has been considered as the most promising candidate for next generation solar cells. Organic iodide lead perovskite, with the composition of MAPbI3, serves as a prototype and dominates this field and has an optical absorbance edge of 850 nm (∼1.5 eV).2
In the MAPbI3 perovskite unit cell, the [PbI6]4− octahedral array forms a relatively stable network; however, the large organic cations at twelve-coordinated sites have large scale freedom of motion. The MA cation is believed to migrate and autorotate in the vicinity of the lattice grid. Thus, it is inclined to generate A-site defects. In principle, A-site defects can be divided into three types: vacancies, substitutions, and interstitials. Some emerging research results have declared that these defect effects play very vital functions on the hybrid perovskite's electric structures as well as the device performance.6 Theoretical predictions deem that MAPbI3 is able to switch from n-type to p-type7 by controlling the defect' type and concentration. Moreover, defect induced ionic migration is also believed to be a critical factor contributing to the perovskite solar cell's unusual behaviour, including current–voltage hysteresis, giant dielectric response at low frequencies, and degradation pathways.8–10
A conspicuous experimental example for the role of A-site defect is the lattice stabilizing effects in formamidinium (FA)-based perovskite. The FA cation, which is a little larger than that of MA, improves the irradiation absorption capacity. However, owing to its instinct property, the dark FAPbI3 phase only exists at high temperatures (usually above 150 °C). The perovskite phase must be stabilized by some other cations with the charge of plus one.11,12 High efficiencies have been achieved by FA–MA mixed perovskite. Considering the valence state distribution in hybrid perovskite lattice, the alkali metal with the charge of plus one is believed to be the ideal substituendum. For example, cesium, a rare alkali metallic element, was introduced to the FA mixed perovskite crystal by Yi et al.,13 and it yielded high average PCEs with the solar cells employing the composition Cs0.2FA0.8PbI2.84Br0.16.
Herein, a new strategy has been adopted by introducing potassium cation, an alkali metal with a much smaller size than MA+ cation, as the mixed substance into MAPbI3 crystal lattice, which thus modifies the hole–electron transport behavior in solar cell devices. We found that the potassium cations mainly occupied interstitial sites in the mixed perovskite lattice and yielded MA vacancies at the same time. Investigations manifest that these interstitial defects induced several positive impacts14–16 on the physical and electrical properties of perovskite films, such as improved crystallinity, red shifted optical band, modified surface work function, and benign separation capacity for photo-generated hole–electron carriers. The photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells can also be improved by a balanced amount of potassium cation mixing.
Experimental
Materials
All of the chemical reagents used are commercial available. PbI2 (99.995%), KI (99.5%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (U.S.A) and CH3NH3I from Xi'An P-OLED Co. (China).
Device fabrication
FTO-coated glass substrates were etched by Zn powder and HCl solution and then rinsed with deionized water, ethanol and acetone. A TiO2 compact layer was then deposited on the substrates by spin-coating method at 4000 rpm for 30 s, using a titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution (75% in 2-propanol, Sigma-Aldrich) in ethanol (1:19, volume ratio) as precursor and baked for 5 min at 120 °C; the compact TiO2 layer was annealed at 500 °C for 60 min. After that, TiCl4 water solution (0.04 M) was used to treat the TiO2 surface at 70 °C for 20 min, followed by heat treatment at 500 °C for 60 min. The mesoporous TiO2 layer composed of 18 nm-sized particles was deposited by spin coating at 5000 rpm for 20 s using a TiO2 paste diluted in ethanol (1:5.5, weight ratio). After drying at 100 °C for 10 min, the TiO2 films were heated to 500 °C and annealed at this temperature for 60 min. The 1.3 M perovskite precursor solutions were prepared by dissolving corresponding amounts of KI, MAI, and PbI2 in DMSO/DMF (1:9 v/v) mixed solvent, and the ratio between KI and PbI2 was defined as ‘x’. The perovskite precursor solution was coated onto the mp-TiO2/bl-TiO2/FTO substrate by an adduct method reported by Park et al.17 Following exposure of the substrates to UV-ozone irradiation for 15 min, the dissolved solution was spin-coated on the mp-TiO2 layer at 4000 rpm for 25 seconds; 0.5 ml diethyl ether was slowly dripped on the rotating substrate 5 seconds after the start of the spin-procedure. The transparent CH3NH3I (KI)·PbI2·DMSO adduct film was heated at 65 °C for 1 min and 125 °C for 20 min in order to obtain a dense perovskite film. After cooling to room temperature, 30 μl HTM was deposited by spin coating at 4000 rpm for 30 s. The HTM solution consists of 36 mg (2,29,7,79-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene)-(spiro-OMeTAD), 14.4 μl 4-tert-butylpyridine and 8.8 μl of 520 mg ml−1 lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide acetonitrile solution dissolved in 0.5 ml chlorobenzene. Finally, 80 nm of silver metal was thermally evaporated on top of the device to form the back contact.
Characterizations
XRD spectra were recorded using a glazing incidence X-ray diffractometer (D8 advance, Bruker). The steady state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (HITACHI F-7000) equipped with a standard light source (P/N 250-0123), with an entire wavelength range of 200 nm to 900 nm by combining with an instrumental response. The current–voltage characteristics were determined, and solar cell measurements were performed using a solar simulator (Newport Oriel Solar 3A Class AAA, 64023A) and a potentiostat (CHI 660D, CH instruments). The measurements were conducted under an illumination of AM 1.5G sun (100 mA cm−2), and the potentiostat was calibrated using a standard Si-solar cell (Oriel, VLSI standards) and a light sensor current controller (Newport Oriel digital exposure controller, Model 68945). All devices were measured by masking the active area with a thin mask (0.14 cm2). J–V characteristics for all devices were measured at a voltage scan rate of 0.1 V s−1.
KPFM images were obtained using a commercialized AFM system (NTEGRA spectra, NT-MDT), equipped with platinum–iridium (Pt–Ir) coated AFM tip.
SEM images and element contents were obtained from a JSM-7600F hot field emission scanning electron microscopy (JEOL, Japan), together with an Oxford SDD EDX instrument.
Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) curves were recorded using a commercial Time Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) system (FluoTim 200, PicoQuant). Samples were photo-excited by picosecond diode laser of 670 nm (LDH-P-C-670, PicoQuant) with a variable repetition rate (800 kHz). The emitted PL was spectrally dispersed using a monochromator (ScienceTech 9030) for each PL signal and was collected using a fast photon multiplier tube (PMT) detector (PMA 182, PicoQuant GmbH) with a magic angle (54.7°) arrangement. The incident angle of excitation pulse was set to be about 30° with respect to the sample. The resulting instrumental response function was about 160 ps in full-width-half-maximum. All signals were measured at the emission peaks (770 ± 5 nm) for perovskite. In addition, a cut-off filter (GG-692 nm, Semrock) was applied to block the remaining scattering.
Results and discussion
The crystal structures of the as-prepared mixed cation perovskite thin films annealed at 125 °C were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), as displayed in Fig. 1. At low mixing mole fraction of K+ (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2), the films exhibit pure tetragonal phase, indicating that the potassium cations enter into the MAPbI3's lattice successfully (Fig. 1(a)). When the K+ concentration increased to 0.3, some impure diffraction peaks at 13.12 and 26.67 degrees appeared, which indicated the addition of excess of KI. At x = 0.5, the second phase can be identified as K2PbI4 (JCPDS 46-0967).
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of the K+ mixed perovskite films (a) whole patterns (b) enlargement of (110) crystal plane and (c) enlargement of (040) plane. 
Peak intensities at 14.15 degrees, which is the dominant (110) crystalline plane in MAPbI3, were investigated to compare the crystalline differences between each compositions. From Fig. 1(b), it was noticed that the crystallization of the perovskite film was enhanced with the increase of K+, with x = 0.2 being the threshold point. Normally, better crystallinity in perovskite is capable of inducing a longer carrier lifetime, so as to increase conversion efficiency. After that, for x = 0.3 and 0.5, the diffraction peak sharply decayed, which was indicative of decreased photovoltaic performance.
Moreover, site occupancy of K+ cations in the MAPbI3 crystalline lattice was speculated by the peak shift of the (040) plane. Compared to the pristine MAPbI3 perovskite films, almost all the (040) peaks shift to a lower degree, as shown in Fig. 1(c), for 0 < x ≤ 0.2. However, the diffraction peaks at lower degrees (e.g. (110) peaks) exhibited almost no visible shift, which proved that the (040) plane shifts were caused by the interplanar spacing transition. According to the Bragg equation 2dsinθ = nλ, it turns out that lattice interplanar spacing grows larger after K+ mixing. On the other hand, by considering the fact that steric radius of K+ is much smaller than that of CH3NH3+ (K+ = 0.138 nm, while CH3NH3+ = 0.203 nm), it is reasonable to conclude that potassium cations mainly occupied interstitial sites in the perovskite lattice and yielded methylammonium vacancies at the same time.14–16 Thus, the defect reaction equation can be expressed as eqn (1), and the schematic displaying the defects in K+ doped perovskite lattice is presented in Fig. 2(a). (1)

Being dependent on the atomic arrangement in MAPbI3 unit cell, the MA+ cations lie parallel to the c axis. The generation of MA vacancies reduces the length of the c axis and further decreases the ratio of c/a in tetragonal lattice. According to Amat et al.'s calculation, effective masses of holes and electrons will decrease with the phase transition from tetragonal to the pseudocubic perovskite phase, leading to better electron and hole transportation than the standard tetragonally distorted MAPbI3.18 The interstitial sites mixing can be further verified by the PL peak shifts in the following section.
Element content distribution was detected from Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) Spectroscopy, and the obtained data is presented in Table S1.† The relative quantities of K atoms display consistency with the target compositions. In Fig. 2(b–f), the surface morphology of perovskite was characterized via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). For 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2, crystal size of the perovskite film is 300–500 nanometers, and there are few significant differences in crystal sizes between different compositions. At x = 0.2, a dense film with uniform grain distribution and legible grain boundaries forms, demonstrating high-quality crystallinity. However, the crystal size decreases to about 150 nm when x = 0.3. Furthermore, some large scale crack defects appear on the surface of the perovskite film. Strip shaped exaggerated grain growth suggests the presence of a secondary phase. The variation of surface morphology implies that the photovoltaic performance might be attenuated at these compositions (x = 0.3 and 0.5).
From the plots of (ahv)2versus hv (hv is the photo energy of the corresponding wavelength) (Fig. 3(a)), the optical band gaps can be calculated. Apparently the optical energy gap decreased a little after K+ mixing, corresponding to a slight red shift. This observation suggests that the K+ doping can play a similar role as FA cations on the band offset for MAPbI3 perovskite. Although the order of the radius size is MA+ > K+, the K+ occupies the interstitial site and enlarges the MAPbI3 lattice cell. This effect is just the same as that of FA+. In addition, the steady state photoluminescence (PL) spectra display similar tendency, as shown in Fig. 3(b). The emission maximum shifts from 775 to 790 nm, on increasing the K concentration from x = 0 to x = 0.3.

Moreover, the potassium mixing has been found to engineer the surface work function of perovskite thin films and migrate their band positions. Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM) was utilized to measure the perovskite thin films' surface potential value. Their surface morphology and the corresponding potential images are displayed in Fig. S1(a).†
For the KPFM system, the detected signal is the contact potential difference (CPD) between the tip and sample. The value of CPD can be expressed as φsample = φtip − eφCPD.19–21 Taking the abovementioned factor into consideration, we are concerned with the variation tendency of perovskite thin films with different compositions. The KPFM images and the corresponding data curves of each component film are presented in Fig. S1(b) and S2.† For intuitive survey, the impact of K+ doping on the perovskite film's surface work function, the CPD data distribution and variation, as well as potassium content is shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen in Fig. 4(f) that for x = 0.1 and 0.2, the work functions of K+ mixed perovskite films are lower than that of MAPbI3. Decreased work function suggests that the electrons are more easily diffused from the perovskite's surface,22,23 leading to an enhancement of electron extraction. On the other hand, the values dramatically rise for x = 0.3 and 0.5.

CPD is also a measure of the Fermi level energy if the electron affinity is known. The semiconductor's conduction band and forbidden band location can be deduced from the following equations: for the bottom of conduction band, Vc = Ef + 1/2Eg, while for valence band maximum, Vb = EF − 1/2Eg, where Eg is the energy band gap of the semiconductor and EF is the Fermi energy level.24
For x = 0.1 and 0.2, the displacement of the CB is minimal from the center of Brillouin zone (Γ) and could possibly be beneficial to reduce carrier recombination,18 and thus contributes to enhance the efficiency of perovskite-based solar cells. Moreover, downward shift of the Fermi level induces better light absorption capacity in the perovskite thin film, which is consistent with the steady state PL spectra.
The photon to current conversion performance of the perovskite solar cells was ascertained by measuring the current density–voltage (J–V) curves. The representative J–V curves and their corresponding PV parameters are tabulated in Table 1. A statistical curve based on the efficiencies data in Table 1 is presented in Fig. S3,† it can be seen that the average PCE of pristine perovskite solar cells can be improved when x = 0.1 and 0.2. In detail, for solar cell devices with pure MAPbI3 film as the light absorber, it displays a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.30% with open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1081 mV, short circuit current density (Jsc) of 21.92 mA cm−2 and a fill factor of 0.73. After K+ mixing, the mixed cation perovskite devices yield enhanced PCEs, compared to pure MAPbI3 devices. In detail, solar cells with the absorber composition of K0.1MA0.9PbI3 exhibit a PCE of 18.36%, with a Voc of 1109 mV, a Jsc of 23.54 mA cm−2 and a fill factor of 0.70. The maximum PCE takes places in x = 0.2, and the champion device shows an overall PCE of 19.27%, with Voc = 1111 mV, Jsc = 23.33 mA cm−2 and a fill factor of 0.74. It appears that the enhancement of PCE is mainly rooted in the increase of Jsc. However, the photovoltaic properties decreased as the K+ mixing amount further increased. For x = 0.3, the PCE declines to 16.89%, with a poor fill factor of 0.69, despite the other parameters maintaining a high level (Voc = 1097 mV, Jsc = 22.31 mA cm−2). When x increased to 0.5, the PCE attenuated to 14.51%. The J–V curves for the pristine and K+ mixed (x = 0.2) perovskite solar cells are illustrated in Fig. 5(a). The steady-state current density was measured at a maximum power point and stabilized power output of the champion device was recorded at 200 s, as exhibited in Fig. 5(b). The outputted steady-state current density is 19.1 mA cm−2, and the calculated output PCE is 17.2%, which is about two percent lower than the value from the J–V curve.

Following this, we further investigated the enhancement mechanisms in detail using time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) technology, which indicated how the excited state electron distribution changes in perovskite. Thin films fabricated on quartz with different configurations were designed: (type A) bare perovskite (pero) to explore the essential exciton lifetime of perovskite; (type B) perovskite deposited on TiO2 (pero-TiO2) to explore the electron's injection ability from perovskite to the electron transport layer (ETL); and (type C) perovskite deposited on spiro-OMeTAD (pero–spiro), to explore the holes extraction ability from perovskite to hole transport layer (HTL). A schematic is presented in Fig. S4† to show the constructions for transient state photoluminescence measurement.
TRPL is a type of persuasive tool to describe the dynamic of various non-radiative and radiative degenerated pathways of photoexcited perovskite. By definition, the carrier lifetime (τ) of type A can be fitted from the original TRPL decay curves by a bi-exponential function (i = 1, 2),25 as expressed in eqn (2). (2)where τ1 is the fast decay component, which should attribute to the bimolecular recombination in the perovskite crystals, while τ2 is the slow decay component longer part, which should be the recombination of free carriers in the radiative channel.26Fig. 6 shows the photoluminescence decay profiles of K+ mixed perovskite films without any quenching layers. The sample without K+ mixing (x = 0) exhibits an average decay lifetime (τave) in amplitude of 20.56 ns. After adding K+, the τave increases orderly along with the potassium contents: 34.83 ns for x = 0.1, 54.31 ns for x = 0.2, 47.99 ns for x = 0.3, and 69.83 ns for x = 0.5. The prolonged carrier lifetimes demonstrate decreased exciton recombination in perovskite film after K+ mixing to the benefit of charge separation later, which might be due to the intermediate energy level induced by interstitial cations and deep trap states.27 In addition, as a supplement here, there was an evident long tail (∼300 ns) for x = 0.5 except τ1 and τ2, which should originate from the second phase (K2PbI4) of the crystal.
 Fig. 6  TRPL and the fitted curves of K+ mixed perovskite films on quartz substrates (IRF = Instrument Response Function). 
However, for samples with ETL (type B) and HTL (type C), a new fast component was found by careful tri-exponential fitting (i = 1, 2, 3).28 When the perovskite films form contact with TiO2 (ETL) or spiro-OMeTAD (HTL), it was observed that the TRPL lifetimes are reduced significantly (Table 2). This manifests that the TiO2 or spiro-OMeTAD served as quenching layers to accelerate the PL decay for perovskite solar cell devices.29 For the TiO2 ETL case (Fig. 5), the lifetime decreases to 18.11 ns, when potassium content equals 0.1. Similarly with bare perovskite film, the decay time increases as x increases, and the τave turns 39.58 ns when x = 0.5. On the other hand, when depositing the spiro-OMeTAD layer as HTL on the perovskite layer (Fig. S6†), the average lifetime also drops 22.20 ns, 21.18 ns, 38.24 ns, and 39.58 ns for x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.5, respectively. The PL quenching between perovskite, ETL and HTL is caused by fast charge transfer at the interfaces, which is the primary charge separation and collection mechanism in perovskite solar cell devices.30

To explore the charge transfer behavior between different perovskite thin films and ETL/HTL interfaces, charge transfer efficiency31 (CTE) for each set of samples has been calculated, according to eqn (3), to prove the holes and electrons transportation capacity of different K+ mixed perovskite. The CTE is the proportion of charge transfer over the summation of rates in all other processes, which could be calculated using average lifetime of each sample as follows: CTE = 1 − τDA/τD(3)where τDA and τD are the donor (pero) average fluorescence lifetimes in the presence and absence of the acceptor (TiO2 and spiro-OMeTAD), respectively. In theory, high-efficient perovskite solar cells require benign circle transportation and injection capacity for both holes and electrons. The CTE results have been presented in Table 2 and Fig. 7; sample x = 0.2 showed values 61% for HTL and 51.23% for ETL, implying favorable transport ability for both electrons and holes. However, when x = 0.5, the film displayed poor CTE (only 14.89%) for ETL, despite of moderate HTL energy transfer efficiency (43.32%), indicating that charge transfer from perovskite to TiO2 could be worse than that of the sprio-OMeTAD. Similarly, it displays unsatisfactory CTE (20.31%) for hole extraction when x = 0.3. However, it is only when outstanding balanced injection and transportation capacity for holes and electrons occur at the same time that perovskite solar cell device (ETL/perovskite/HTL) can achieve high conversion efficiency.5,32 These grievous imbalanced hole–electron transportation rates for x = 0.3 and 0.5 certainly become the essential blockage, leading to poor device conversion efficiency.

Conclusions
In summary, by mixing A-site in the MAPbI3 lattice structure through potassium cations, we created two types of defects in inorganic–organic perovskite: MA vacancies and K+ interstitial atoms. The above defects lead to a series of variations on the perovskite films optical and electrical properties. Such as improved crystallinity, red shifted optical band and PL emission peaks, as well as modified surface work function. Even more importantly, the mixing of K+ is able to prolong the carrier lifetime in the perovskite film. CTE calculations conclude that the electron-injection and hole-extraction abilities vary momentously along with the K+ content. When K+ content is 0.2, the perovskite film exhibits benign separation capacity for both photo-generated holes and electrons, leading to optimized conversion efficiency of 19.3%. Further research will focus on expanding its application on LED devices and investigating the influence of interstitial defects on solar cell's stability.
