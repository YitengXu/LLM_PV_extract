However, the solar energy conversion efficiency is far from satisfactory, which restricts its practical application. The development of semiconductor materials is crucial to promote the solar energy conversion efficiency in photocatalytic systems. Owing to the Bi 6s and O 2p hybrid orbitals in the valence band, most of the bismuth-based photocatalysts possess a narrow bandgap for visible light utilization, which has attracted increasing attention.

1. Introduction
The construction of a carbon-neutral society has become the global consensus for sustainable development. However, the current global energy consumption is still highly dependent on fossil fuels, which not only leads to the depletion of non-renewable energy resources, but also causes the emission of CO2. Therefore, it is critically important for the development of novel technology for renewable energy production and environmental remediation. Semiconductor photocatalysis has attracted increasing attention because of its great potential for solar fuel production,1–10 CO2 reduction,11–14 pollution degradation15–18 and value-added chemical synthesis.19–22 The mechanisms and fundamental concepts of photocatalysis have been comprehensively demonstrated in many review articles,23–27 which will not be further repeated in this article. In a photocatalytic system, semiconductor photocatalysts have multiple functions for light absorption, photogenerated electron–hole separation, and charge transfer to the surfaces for redox reactions. Thus, the development of novel semiconductor photocatalysts is the key to drive the advancement of photocatalytic technology.
Bismuth comprises a large family of earth-abundant photocatalysts, which has attracted considerable attention in recent years.28–30 Compared to many other metal oxide semiconductors whose valence band (VB) is generally composed of the O 2p orbital, the valence band of bismuth-based semiconductor materials consists of Bi 6s and O 2p hybrid orbitals, resulting in a reduced bandgap.31 Thus, most of the bismuth-based semiconductor materials have a bandgap less than 3.0 eV, exhibiting excellent visible light absorption properties. There is no doubt that bismuth-based semiconductor materials have become an important class of photocatalysts, and various strategies, including nanostructure control,32–34 heterojunction construction,35–38 extrinsic element doping,39–41 defect engineering,42–45 and crystal facet engineering,46–48 have been developed to improve their performances.
Although some review articles focusing on photocatalysis of bismuth-based nanomaterials have been published in recent years,28,30,31,49–51 most of them only discussed a few types of bismuth-based materials. Owing to the dynamic development of this field, a comprehensive review fully covering this material family for photocatalysis is still necessary to provide readers with state-of-the-art progress. In this review article, we aim to critically discuss the emerging bismuth-based nanomaterials for photocatalysis, including powder-based systems and thin-film-based photoelectrochemical (PEC) systems. The main photocatalytic applications such as pollutant degradation, water splitting, CO2 reduction, N2 fixation, and organic synthesis are covered in this review article. Based on the number of elements involved in the compound, bismuth-based photocatalysts are divided into four types: single-component bismuth nanoparticles, binary bismuth compounds, ternary bismuth compounds, and other bismuth compounds, which will be discussed with critical analyses on their photocatalytic properties. In addition, the emerging strategies to enhance their photocatalytic performances will be reviewed. Finally, the main challenges and prospects of bismuth-based nanomaterials for efficient photocatalysis will be presented. We hope to shed light on the further development of this important field.
2. Fundamental requirements of photocatalysts
Before comprehensively reviewing the recent progress of bismuth-based photocatalysts for pollutant degradation, water splitting, CO2 reduction, N2 fixation, and organic synthesis, the fundamental requirements of photocatalysts in the applications of these five areas will be briefly introduced.
2.1 Pollutant degradation
For instance in organic dye degradation, the photogenerated holes (h+) can react easily with the surface bound H2O molecules to produce ˙OH radicals, while the photogenerated electrons (e−) can react with O2 to produce superoxide radical anions of oxygen (˙O2−). Owing to the highly oxidizing capability of the ˙OH and ˙O2− radicals, organic dyes will be decomposed. The photocatalytic reactions are shown below:52 H2O + h+ → ˙OH + H+(1) O2 + e− → ˙O−2(2) ˙O−2 + H2O → H2O2(3) H2O2 → 2˙OH(4) ˙OH + dye → degradation products(5)
In particular, the ˙OH radical is a very strong oxidizing agent (standard redox potential +2.8 V), which can oxidize most organic dyes to mineral end-products.53 In order to promote dye degradation, the photocatalysts should have a deep VB to provide strong oxidation capability of holes for the generation of ˙OH.
2.2 Water splitting
For overall water splitting, the conduction band (CB) edge of a photocatalyst should be more negative than the hydrogen evolution potential of 0 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), while its VB edge should be more positive than the oxygen evolution potential of 1.23 V vs. RHE.54 However, most of the photocatalysts either have a CB more negative than 0 V vs. RHE (hydrogen evolution photocatalyst, HEP) or have a VB more positive than 1.23 V vs. RHE (oxygen evolution photocatalyst, OEP), which can only drive half water splitting reactions in the presence of sacrificial agents. Encouragingly, HEP and OEP with matched band edge positions can form Z-scheme junctions for overall water splitting.55 In addition, the combination of a photocathode composed of HEP and a photoanode composed of OEP can also achieve unbiased PEC overall water splitting.56 Owing to the sluggish surface reaction kinetics, hydrogen evolution cocatalysts (HECs) and oxygen evolution cocatalysts (OECs) are generally required for water splitting.
2.3 CO2 reduction
Compared to water splitting, CO2 reduction is much more complex and various final products such as CO, HCOOH, HCHO, CH3OH, and CH4 can be obtained. The generations of these products require different potentials, as shown below (E0V vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), pH = 7):57 CO2 + e− → CO−2E0 = −1.90 V(6) CO2 + 2e− + 2H+ → HCOOH E0 = −0.61 V(7) CO2 + 2e− + 2H+ → CO + H2O E0 = −0.53 V(8) CO2 + 4e− + 4H+ → HCHO + H2O E0 = −0.48 V(9) CO2 + 6e− + 6H+ → CH3OH + H2O E0 = −0.38 V(10) CO2 + 8e− + 8H+ → CH4 + H2O E0 = −0.24 V(11) H2O + 2h+ → 1/2O2 + 2H+E0 = 0.82 V(12)
According to eqn (6), the CO2 molecule to accept the first electron requires a very negative potential, which is the most challenging step for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. In addition, hydrogen evolution will be the competitive reaction for CO2 reduction. The required standard potential for hydrogen evolution is shown below (E0V vs. NHE, pH = 7):12 2H+ + 2e− → H2E0 = −0.41 V(13)
To suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction, appropriate cocatalysts are needed for CO2 reduction. In addition, different cocatalysts can promote different reactions, which is beneficial for the selective formation of products. It should be mentioned that CO2 reduction involves multiple transfer of electrons, so the reaction kinetics should also be carefully considered. Owing to the thermodynamic and kinetic limitations, efficient photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with a highly selective product is very challenging.
2.4 N2 fixation
Thermodynamically, photocatalytic N2 fixation is extremely challenging, and the involved reactions with the required potentials are shown below (E0V vs. NHE, pH = 7):58 N2 + e− → N−2E0 = −4.57 V(14) N2 + H+ + e− → N2H E0 = −3.61 V(15) N2 + 2H+ + 2e− → N2H2E0 = −1.51 V(16) N2 + 4H+ + 4e− → N2H4E0 = −0.77 V(17) N2 + 5H+ + 4e− → N2H+5E0 = −0.64 V(18) N2 + 8H+ + 6e− → 2NH+4E0 = −0.14 V(19) N2 + 6H+ + 6e− → 2NH3E0 = 0.14 V(20)
Since the NN triple bond is very stable, its cleavage requires an extremely high energy input. According to eqn (14), the activation of N2 requires a very negative potential of −4.57 V vs. NHE (pH = 7), which is much more negative compared to the activation potential for CO2 reduction (eqn (6)). From the thermodynamic point of view, it is of great challenge to select a suitable semiconductor material for N2 fixation. In addition, the suppression of hydrogen evolution as the competitive reaction during N2 fixation is another challenging task. Deep understanding of the kinetics during N2 fixation should be essential to drive the advancement of this research area.
2.5 Organic synthesis
For organic synthesis, the mechanism is to utilize the redox capability of photogenerated electrons and holes to induce an electron transfer to or from a substrate, producing radical anions or cations (or neutral radicals if cationic or anionic starting materials are applied), followed by the formation of an overall neutral radical as the reactive species that initiates a chemical transformation.59 For detailed mechanisms of visible light photocatalysis for organic synthesis, readers may refer to a recent review article for more information.59 Compared to conventional thermal chemistry, photocatalytic organic synthesis can utilize energy from light to induce chemical reactions at room temperature, which is very attractive in this research area.
3. Classification of bismuth-based photocatalysts
In the past few decades, numerous bismuth-based nanomaterials such as metallic bismuth nanoparticles (NPs), BiVO4, BiOX (X = F, Cl, Br, and I), Bi2MO6 (M = Mo, W), and CuBi2O4 have been explored for photocatalysis. Despite their visible light responsive properties, most of the bismuth-based nanomaterials still suffer from severe charge recombination. Worldwide efforts have been focused on suppressing charge separation in the bulk and surfaces of these photocatalysts. According to the number of elements involved, bismuth-based nanomaterials can be primarily divided into four types: single-component bismuth nanoparticles, binary bismuth compounds, ternary bismuth compounds, and other bismuth compounds, as shown in Fig. 1.

4. Recent progress of bismuth-based nanomaterials
In this section, we will review the state-of-the-art progress of bismuth-based nanomaterials for photocatalysis. In particular, the challenges of each material for photocatalysis and the emerging strategies to enhance the performances will be critically discussed.
4.1 Single-component bismuth nanoparticles
Bismuth (Bi) is a typical semimetal material with a high carrier mobility and a very small band overlap energy. Interestingly, a semimetal-to-semiconductor transition phenomenon was observed for Bi thin films with a thickness of 30 nm due to the quantum confinement effect.60 Moreover, Bi NPs exhibit the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect that is generally observed in noble metal NPs such as Au and Ag.61 Owing to the above unique properties, Bi has attracted increasing attention in the field of photocatalysis.
Owing to the capability to convert solar energy into electron–hole pairs, Bi NPs can be directly used as a photocatalyst. As shown in Fig. 2a, b, Bi NPs with a size of around 100–200 nm were prepared by a facile chemical solution method, exhibiting excellent and stable photocatalytic activity for nitrogen monoxide (NO) oxidation under ultra-violet (UV) light illumination (λ = 280 nm).62 Interestingly, a catalytic “memory” capability was observed, enabling the photogenerated reactive species to initiate a chemical reaction after the light was turned off (Fig. 1c, d). The photocatalytic activity and the catalytic “memory” capability of Bi NPs are attributed to the UV-mediated SPR effect and the long-lived active species, respectively (Fig. 1e). By reducing the size to 30–60 nm, Bi NPs exhibited two absorption peaks at 425 and 575 nm, leading to a good photocatalytic activity for rhodamine B (RhB) degradation under visible light illumination.63 Moreover, photocatalytic activity for Cr(VI) reduction under both UV and visible light illumination was also observed for Bi nanowire networks.64 In addition to powder photocatalysis, Bi films also showed PEC activity under both UV and visible light illumination, in spite of the very low photocurrent densities.65

Owing to the SPR effect, Bi NPs can also be used to couple with other semiconductor materials to enhance their photocatalytic activities. For example, Bi@Bi2O3 microspheres with a size of 1.2–2.8 μm showed photocatalytic activity for RhB and methyl orange (MO) degradation under UV light illumination.66 However, the function of Bi in Bi@Bi2O3 microspheres was not studied in this work. Since Bi was embedded in Bi2O3 microspheres, the SPR effect of Bi may not be well realized. To make good use of the SPR effect of Bi NPs, it is more reasonable to deposit Bi NPs on the surfaces of other semiconductors. For instance, the in situ deposition of Bi NPs on (BiO)2CO3 led to a significant enhancement of visible light photocatalytic activity, which is attributed to the SPR effect, efficient charge separation and prolonged lifetime of the charge carriers.67–69 Likewise, the decoration of Bi NPs on g-C3N4 also showed enhanced photocatalytic activity in removing NO in a part-per-billion (ppb)-level under visible light illumination, because of the heterojunction and SPR effects of Bi NPs.70
Despite the observed enhanced photocatalytic activity for Bi NP modified semiconductor photocatalysts, the charge transfer route between the semiconductor and Bi NPs is still not clear. Recently, an investigation on BiOBr nanosheets with Bi NPs deposited on (001) and (010) facets found that surface charge alternation on the (010) facet is more favorable for interfacial charge separation and transfer.71 As shown in Fig. 3a, a new charge transfer route was established between the contacted Bi NPs and (010) facets of BiOBr along the path of [Bi2O2]2+ → Bi NPs → Br−. Other Bi NP based heterojunctions such as Bi-BiOI/graphene,72 Bi/graphene oxide,73 Bi/Bi2MoO6,74 Bi/Bi2WO6,75–77 Bi/BiPO4,78,79 Bi/TiO2,80,81 Bi/BiOCl,82–85 Bi/BiOClxI1−x,86 Bi/Bi2O3,87,88 C/Bi/Bi2O3,89 and Bi/BiVO4 (ref. 90) also showed enhanced photocatalytic activities.

In addition to powder photocatalytic systems, Bi NPs can also improve the activity of photoelectrodes in PEC systems. For example, a Bi/BiVO4 photoanode was prepared by depositing Bi NPs on BiVO4 nanoarrays, exhibiting a photocurrent density 2-fold higher than that of its bare BiVO4 counterpart.92 The enhanced PEC performance is attributed to the increase of the charge separation and hole injection efficiencies, as well as the suppressed back reaction of water oxidation. Similarly, Bi NPs decorated on porous BiVO4 films also showed enhanced photocurrent densities and incident photon-to-current efficiencies (IPCEs).93 Owing to the SPR effect, Bi NPs can improve the visible light absorption of BiVO4. In addition, the partial oxidation of Bi NPs during the PEC water splitting process also contributes to the enhanced photocurrent density. Encouragingly, a recent study found that inserting a reduce graphene oxide (rGO) layer between the Bi NPs and BiVO4 photoanode is efficient to boost its PEC performance, exhibiting a very high photocurrent density of 6.05 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE (Fig. 3b–e).91 It was demonstrated that Bi NPs can improve the charge carrier density while rGO can increase the charge carrier mobility, leading to the enhanced PEC performance. On the other hand, the dual functions of Bi NPs in enhancing the charge transfer and SPR effect can also improve the PEC activity of a Bi/BiOCl photocathode for hydrogen (H2) evolution.94 Similarly, a Bi modified TiO2 nanotube array photoanode exhibited a significant improvement of photocurrent density under visible light illumination (λ ≥ 420 nm), which is contributed to the SPR of Bi and the optimized charge transfer and transport properties.95
Despite some progress of Bi NPs for photocatalysis, this research field is still at the very early stage and the potential of Bi NPs has not been fully realized. For example, even though the SPR effect of Bi NPs has been demonstrated in many semiconductor photocatalyst systems,96–98 factors affecting the SPR effect of Bi NPs are seldom investigated. Since the SPR effect depends on the size and shape of the NPs,99,100 the development of appropriate strategies to control the size and shape of Bi NPs should be essential for the further advancement of this interesting research area.
4.2 Binary bismuth compounds
Generally, bismuth forms a trivalent cation (Bi3+) in compounds. The common binary bismuth compounds applied in photocatalysis are bismuth sesquioxide (Bi2O3) and chalcogenides (e.g., Bi2S3, Bi2Se3, and Bi2Te3), which will be discussed in the following subsections.

4.2.1 Bismuth oxides. 
Bi2O3 is the simplest bismuth compound with a bandgap of 2.1–2.8 eV, which is an attractive visible light responsive semiconductor material for photocatalysis.101 Interestingly, Bi2O3 has numerous polymorphs, including the alpha (α-Bi2O3, monoclinic), beta (β-Bi2O3, tetragonal), gamma (γ-Bi2O3, body-centered cubic), delta (δ-Bi2O3, face-centered cubic), omega (ω-Bi2O3, triclinic), and epsilon (ε-Bi2O3, tetragonal) phases.102,103 The transformation conditions between two phases are shown in Fig. 4. So far, α-Bi2O3,104 β-Bi2O3,105 γ-Bi2O3,106,107 and δ-Bi2O3 (ref. 108) have been investigated as photocatalysts. It is worth noting that the phase of Bi2O3 affects its photocatalytic activity. For example, β-Bi2O3 showed higher photocatalytic activity than α-Bi2O3 for organic dye degradation.109–111 By evaluating the photocatalytic degradation properties for RhB, γ-Bi2O3 was found to exhibit higher photocatalytic activity than α-Bi2O3 due to the lower electron–hole recombination rate.112 Interestingly, a new bismuth oxide of monoclinic dibismuth tetraoxide (m-Bi2O4) with a light absorption edge up to 620 nm was also synthesized, exhibiting higher photocatalytic activity and photostability than Bi2O3 and CdS.113

Nanostructures are beneficial for charge separation in semiconductor materials, which is effective to improve the photocatalytic activity of Bi2O3. For example, α-Bi2O3 single crystallites with grain sizes of 40–100 nm showed much higher photocatalytic activity than those of micro-sized Bi2O3 and TiO2 (Degussa P25) under visible light illumination (λ > 400 nm).114 As shown in Fig. 5A–D, α-Bi2O3 photocatalysts converted from (BiO)2CO3 by calcination possess a bandgap of 2.72 eV, exhibiting superior and stable photocatalytic activity for NO and formaldehyde (HCHO) degradation at a typical indoor air concentration under visible light illumination.115 Crystalline α-Bi2O3 nanoparticles with well-organized honeycomb brush-like and worm-like morphologies were prepared by calcining microrod-like hydrated bismuth oxalates at different temperatures.116 Bi2O3 hierarchical nanostructures exhibited 6–10 times higher photocatalytic activity than the commercial sample for RhB degradation under visible light illumination (λ > 420 nm).117 The photocatalytic degradation of acid orange 7 (AO7) dye showed that the honeycomb-like α-Bi2O3 has much better activity, indicating that the morphology also affects the photocatalytic activity.

Encouragingly, β-Bi2O3 nanospheres with a bandgap of 2.36 eV showed excellent photocatalytic activity for acetaminophen (APAP) degradation under visible light illumination, which was much better than that of commercial Bi2O3, synthetic α-Bi2O3, nitrogen doped TiO2 and Degussa P25 (Fig. 5E–H).118 The narrower bandgap, nanostructure, good dispersion and high oxidation power of the β-Bi2O3 nanospheres were believed to promote the photocatalytic activity. Interestingly, commercial Bi2O3 was also used as a photocatalyst for the direct asymmetric α-alkylation of aldehydes with α-bromocarbonyl compounds under white light or natural sunlight illumination (Fig. 5I).119 Likewise, Bi2O3 also showed outstanding performance for visible-light driven photo-induced electron transfer (PET) and macromolecular design by interchange of xanthate (MADIX) polymerization of various monomers under the illumination of a generic household light bulb (Fig. 5J).120 Other applications of Bi2O3 such as visible-light-driven photocatalysis inactivation of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria were also reported.121
Doping Bi2O3 with rare earth elements can also improve its photocatalytic activity. For example, Sm3+ doping of Bi2O3 significantly reduced its bandgap from 2.82 to 2.0 eV, leading to a red shift in the light absorption range of 450–600 nm.122 Owing to the reduced bandgap and enhanced charge separation efficiency, the Sm-doped Bi2O3 showed higher photocatalytic activity than TiO2 and pure Bi2O3. Similarly, Dy-doped Bi2O3 also showed a reduced bandgap.123 Interestingly, although doping β-Bi2O3 with Er3+ did not show obvious red shift of the light absorption edge, the dopant of Er3+ was able to transform visible light into UV light for β-Bi2O3, leading to significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity (Fig. 6A–C).124 Gd-doped β-Bi2O3 photocatalysts exhibited significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity for the degradation of MO, RhB and phenol under visible light illumination.125 The doped Gd3+ ions in β-Bi2O3 photocatalysts function as efficient scavengers to trap photoelectrons, promoting the separation of electron–hole pairs. Likewise, the synergistic effects of La and Ce in the La/Ce-codoped Bi2O3 photocatalyst could effectively suppress the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, exhibiting much higher photocatalytic activity than its bare Bi2O3, single La or Ce doped Bi2O3 counterparts.126 In addition, doping Bi2O3 with other cations such as Ag+, Cs+, Ti4+, Cu2+, Te4+, V5+, Cr6+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Ru3+, Sr2+, and Pd2+ also showed enhanced photocatalytic activity compared to their pure counterparts.127–138

Non-metal doping is also effective to improve the photocatalytic activity of Bi2O3. For example, doping S into α-Bi2O3 photocatalysts promoted the photocatalytic activity for RhB degradation under visible light illumination.141 Surprisingly, it was found that the S atom occupies the Bi site instead of the O site in the α-Bi2O3 crystal, leading to a lighter electron and hole effective mass compared to pure α-Bi2O3. As a result, charge carrier transfer in S doped α-Bi2O3 is easier, which can effectively reduce the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. As shown in Fig. 6D–F, C-doped Bi2O3 exhibited an obvious red-shift in the light absorption curve, leading to excellent photocatalytic activity for MO degradation under visible light illumination.139 Upon fluorination of Bi2O3, the oxidation power of the photogenerated holes was increased and the recombination of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs was suppressed, resulting in much higher photocatalytic activity for MO degradation (Fig. 6G, H).140 A Bi2O3 film with oxygen defects and a honeycomb multilevel structure was prepared on a Ti sheet, exhibiting a photocurrent response under visible light illumination (λ ≥ 420 nm) and a bias of 3 V.142
Coupling Bi2O3 with other semiconductor materials to form heterojunctions is effective to improve the photogenerated electron–hole separation efficiency, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activities. For example, a direct Z-scheme of Bi2O3/g-C3N4 was fabricated by distributing quantum sized ω-Bi2O3 nanoparticles on the surfaces of mesoporous g-C3N4, exhibiting higher photocatalytic activity for phenol degradation than pure Bi2O3 and g-C3N4.143 As shown in Fig. 7a, b, decorating Bi2O3 quantum dots (QDs) on the surfaces of TiO2 achieved a H2-production rate of 920 μmol h−1 g−1, which is 73 times higher than that of pure TiO2.144 It was found that Bi2O3 QDs tend to be reduced to metallic Bi under light illumination, acting as a cocatalyst to promote the H2 evolution reaction and charge separation (Fig. 7c). In addition, a Bi2O3/TiO2 junction also showed improved photocatalytic activity in the removal of Pb(II) and dibutyl phthalate mixed pollutants under visible light illumination.145 A Bi2O3/Bi2SiO5 p–n junction showed higher photocatalytic activity than α-Bi2O3 for organic pollutant degradation under simulated sunlight illumination.146 Interestingly, the fabrication of the Bi2O3/Bi2SiO5 p–n junction induced the formation of β-Bi2O3, which also contributed to enhanced photocatalytic activity along with the p–n junction. Similarly, a Bi2O3/Bi2O2CO3 heterojunction also showed enhanced photocatalytic activity for organic degradation and NO oxidation under visible light illumination.147–149 A Bi2O4−x/Bi2O3 junction was prepared by exposing Bi2O3 photocatalysts to UV illumination to generate a small amount of Bi2O4−x on the surfaces, which enhanced the visible light absorption and promoted the generation of reactive O2˙− radicals, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activity under visible light illumination.150 Other Bi2O3-based binary junctions such as α-Bi2O3/β-Bi2O3,151 Bi12O17Cl2/β-Bi2O3,152 Bi2O3/BiOCl,153,154 β-Bi2O3@g-C3N4,155 Bi2O3@TiO2,156 SrTiO3/Bi2O3,157 AgBr@Bi2O3,158 β-Bi2O3/BiVO4,159 α-Bi2O3/Cd0.5Zn0.5S,160 Bi2O3/CuNiFe LDHs,161 Bi2O3/Bi2S3,162 BiO1.2I0.6/Bi2O3,163 α-Bi2O3/C-dots,164 and CuOx/α-Bi2O3 (ref. 165) also show enhanced photocatalytic activity.

In addition to binary heterojunctions, the construction of Bi2O3-based ternary junctions is also effective to promote photocatalysis. For example, WO3/g-C3N4/Bi2O3 composites showed much higher visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity for tetracycline degradation than pure g-C3N4, WO3, Bi2O3 or their binary composites.167 The excellent photocatalytic activity of WO3/g-C3N4/Bi2O3 composites is attributed to the enhanced visible light absorption, increased surface area and improved charge separation efficiency. Similarly, a Bi2S3/Bi2O3/Bi2O2CO3 photocatalyst also exhibited superior photocatalytic activity for formaldehyde gas elimination compared to those of pure Bi2O2CO3 and Bi2O3/Bi2O2CO3, due to its increased light absorption and efficient charge separation.168 A p–n junction composed of Bi2O3/Bi2S3/MoS2 exhibited enhanced photocatalytic water oxidation under visible light illumination compared to those of pure Bi2O3 and MoS2, which is attributed to the extension of light absorption and p–n junction with a better band alignment between Bi2O3, Bi2S3, and MoS2 (Fig. 7d, e).166 Other Bi2O3-based ternary junctions such as C/Fe3O4/Bi2O3,169 CuO/g-C3N4/Bi2O3,170 TiO2/ZnO/Bi2O3,171 BiVO4/graphene/Bi2O3,172 MIL-53(Fe)/α-Bi2O3/g-C3N4,173 Bi/Bi2O3/Bi2WO6,174 and Au-α-Bi2O3/Bi2O2CO3 (ref. 175) have also been reported.


4.2.2 Bismuth chalcogenides. 
Bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3) has a bandgap of 1.28–1.84 eV depending on the synthesis conditions,176 indicating its excellent visible light absorption properties. Therefore, Bi2S3 is generally used as a sensitizer for other semiconductor materials to broaden their light absorption range. However, like many other metal sulfides, Bi2S3 also suffers from photo-corrosion and the reports of pure Bi2S3 for photocatalysis are rare.177
Bi2S3-based heterojunctions have been widely applied in powder systems. For example, a 3D Z-scheme junction of Bi2S3/rGO/BiVO4 was prepared by introducing Bi2S3 and BiVO4 into a graphene aerogel (Fig. 8a), exhibiting excellent photocatalytic activity for the simultaneous removal of Cr(VI) and bisphenol A (BPA) under visible light illumination.178 As shown in Fig. 8b, the graphene aerogel serves as an efficient electron mediator between Bi2S3 and BiVO4, which promotes the photogenerated electron transfer from the CB of BiVO4 to recombine with the holes in the VB of Bi2S3. As a result, the photogenerated electrons accumulating in the CB of Bi2S3 trigger the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III), while the photogenerated holes induce BPA degradation. Zn0.5Cd0.5S/Bi2S3 nanospheres exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity for RhB degradation under visible light illumination.179 The prepared Bi2S3 nanorods have a broad light absorption range up to near infrared light, which is efficient for light-to-heat conversion, leading to the increase of the reaction temperature around the micro-environment of the Zn0.5Cd0.5S/Bi2S3 photocatalysts. Consequently, the photocatalytic reaction rate is increased. By using a CdS/Bi2S3 heterostructure as the photosensitizer for tetra (4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin iron(III) chloride (FeTCPP), a CdS/Bi2S3/FeTCPP heterojunction was formed, exhibiting a CO yield of 7.73 mmol g−1 and a H2 yield of 24.30 mmol g−1 after 4 h for CO2 reduction under visible-light illumination (Fig. 8c, d).180 Similarly, other Bi2S3 based heterojunctions including Bi2S3/Bi2WO6,181–183 BiOCl/Bi2S3,184 Bi2S3/g-C3N4,185 Bi2S3/rGO,186 Bi2S3/ZnS,187 and Pd4S/Bi2S3 (ref. 188) also showed enhanced photocatalytic activities.

In addition, Bi2S3 can promote the PEC performances of other photoelectrodes. For example, BiOCl/Bi2S3 type-II nano-heterostructures were synthesized by epitaxial growth of Bi2S3 nanorods on BiOCl nanosheets, which showed enhanced PEC performance under visible light illumination compared to the bare BiOCl and Bi2S3 photoanodes.190 A large interfacial heterojunction area is important for the design of an efficient heterostructure. Bi2S3 QD sensitized TiO2 nanotube (NT) films exhibited a higher photocurrent density for PEC water splitting under visible light illumination (427 nm ≤ λ ≤ 655 nm, 10 mW cm−2) than pristine TiO2 NTs, which is attributed to the enhanced electron excitation in the visible region, charge carrier separation and transport efficiencies.191 Likewise, Bi2S3 nanowire sensitized TiO2 nanorod films also showed enhanced PEC performance.192 A WO3/Bi2S3 photoanode was prepared by growing Bi2S3 nanorods on WO3 nanoplates, exhibiting a high photocurrent density of 5.95 mA cm−2 at 0.9 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5 G illumination.193 The excellent PEC performance is mainly attributed to the efficient light-harvesting ability of Bi2S3 and the type-II heterojunction formed between WO3 and Bi2S3 which promotes charge separation and transfer.
Interestingly, a Bi2S3 nanobelt/WO3 nanoplate array film was prepared by hydrothermally treating a BiVO4/WO3 film in the presence of thiourea, exhibiting an excellent photocurrent density of 8.91 mA cm−2 at −0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl in an electrolyte composed of 0.1 M Na2SO3 and 0.1 M Na2S.194 Impressively, a Ag/Bi2S3 photoanode prepared by decorating plasmonic Ag NPs on Bi2S3 nanoflowers exhibited a photocurrent density as high as 12.34 mA cm−2 at 2 V vs. Ag/AgCl for PEC water splitting in a electrolyte composed of 0.1 M Na2SO3 and 0.1 M Na2S, which is 2 times higher than that of its Bi2S3 nanoflower counterpart (Fig. 8e–g).189 The enhanced PEC performance is attributed to the expansion of the light absorption edge, the transfer of plasmonic hot electrons from Ag NPs, and the higher charge separation efficiency at the interface. Similarly, a BiVO4/Bi2S3 photoanode showed enhanced photocurrent densities for PEC water splitting compared to its bare BiVO4 counterpart.195–197
So far, research on bismuth chalcogenides for photocatalysis has mainly been focused on Bi2S3, while reports of other bismuth chalcogenides such as Bi2Se3 (bandgap 0.35–1.2 eV) and Bi2Te3 (bandgap 0.15 eV) for photocatalysis are significantly fewer,198,199 possibly because their bandgaps are too small. Bi2Se3-deposited TiO2 nanobelts exhibited enhanced visible light photocatalytic degradation of RhB compared to pure TiO2 ones.200 Interestingly, a Bi2Se3/Bi2SeO2 junction was synthesized by a conventional reflux and heating method, which can enlarge the bandgap of Bi2Se3 from 0.35–1.2 eV to 1.34 eV, exhibiting a H2 production rate of 136 μmol g−1 h−1 under visible light illumination.201 Encouragingly, a Bi2Se3/Bi1.007Se0.993 solid solution could enlarge the bandgap of Bi2Se3 from 0.3 eV to 1.38 eV and adjust the CB edge to −0.3 eV vs. NHE, which significantly enhanced the methylene blue (MB) degradation rate by 15 times.202 The doping of BiSe photocatalysts with S was effective to tune the light absorption edge and the CB edge, which significantly improved the photocatalytic activity for MB degradation under visible light illumination.203 Similarly, Bi2Se3−xOx photocatalysts were synthesized by introducing oxygen impurities as the dopant for Bi2Se3, which can significantly promote the charge separation, leading to a high photocatalytic activity for the degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride (TC).204 In addition, Ni doped Bi2Se3 also showed enhanced photocatalytic activity for the degradation of malachite green (MG) dye under visible light illumination.198 A Bi2Te3/BiOCl composite was designed for N2 photofixation, exhibiting a nitrogen photofixation rate of 315.9 μmol L−1 h−1 under UV light illumination.205 The incorporation of Bi2Te3 can effectively enhance the light absorption and charge separation, which contributes to enhanced photocatalytic activity for nitrogen fixation.

4.3 Ternary bismuth compounds

4.3.1 BiMO4. 
4.3.1.1 BiPO4. 
Bismuth phosphate (BiPO4) has a wide bandgap of 3.75 eV for UV light absorption, which shows higher photocatalytic activity than TiO2.206,207 Owing to the limited light harvesting capability, studies on BiPO4 are mainly focused on forming heterojunctions with other narrow-bandgap semiconductors or doping with other elements to reduce its bandgap.
To increase the visible light absorption properties of BiPO4 while keeping its strong photocatalytic oxidation capability, a BiPO4/Bi2SiO5 heterojunction was constructed by a simple co-precipitate method (Fig. 9a).208 Under 365 nm UV light illumination, the optimized Bi2SiO5/BiPO4 heterostructure exhibited significantly improved photocatalytic activity for the degradation of phenol and MB, while its pure BiPO4 counterpart showed no photocatalytic activity. As shown in Fig. 9b, c, the enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to the increased charge separation efficiency, good crystallinity, extended light absorption edge and moderate BET specific surface area. Similarly, a BiPO4/graphene heterojunction was synthesized by a one-step solvothermal method, exhibiting a 2-fold higher photocatalytic activity for MO degradation compared to pure BiPO4.209 The enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to a larger surface area, significantly enhanced adsorption capacity and more effective charge transport and separation. Surface decoration of BiPO4 with BiOBr nanoflakes to form a p–n heterojunction showed significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity for MB degradation under visible light illumination.210 Likewise, a BiPO4/BiOI heterojunction also showed enhanced photocatalytic activity for phenol degradation under visible light illumination (λ > 420 nm).211 As shown in Fig. 9d, a core/shell structured BiPO4@C3N4 photocatalyst was synthesized by a facile ultrasonic dispersion process.212 The optimized BiPO4@C3N4 exhibited a 2.5-fold enhancement of photocatalytic activity for MB degradation under UV light illumination compared to that of pure BiPO4 (Fig. 9e). In addition, the loading of C3N4 can significantly enhance the visible light photocatalytic activity (Fig. 9f). In addition to binary heterojunctions, other more complicated BiPO4-based heterojunctions such as BiPO4/TiO2/gC3N4,213 Ag/Ag3PO4/BiPO4,214 and Ag/BiPO4/BiOBr/BiFeO3 (ref. 215) also showed enhanced photocatalytic activity.

Doping is effective to tune the electronic structure of BiPO4. For example, Yb3+ doped BiPO4 photocatalysts could improve the photogenerated electron–hole separation, exhibiting enhanced photocatalytic activity for RhB degradation under UV light illumination.217 However, the Yb3+ dopant caused a blue-shift in the light absorption, which reduces the light absorption range. A fluorine doped BiPO4 photocatalyst was prepared by an in situ fluorination process, exhibiting an enhanced photocatalytic activity for MB degradation compared to its pure counterpart.218 It was found that the doping of fluorine was caused by partially substituting the lattice oxygen with fluorine, which enhanced polarizability that was beneficial for charge separation. Although a red shift of the light absorption edge was observed for F-doped BiPO4, the light absorption range was still in the UV region. Similarly, an N-doped BiPO4 photocatalyst could reduce the bandgap from approximately 4.6 eV to 3.7 eV,219 but the light absorption is still located in the UV region. As shown in Fig. 9g–i, BiPO4−x nanorods synthesized by introducing oxygen vacancies exhibited significant enhancement of photocatalytic activity compared to pure BiPO4 under UV light illumination, which is attributed to the significantly reduced bandgap from 4.1 eV to 3.3 eV that can absorb a broader range of UV light, as well as the enhanced charge separation efficiency.216
Based on the above discussion, doping can enhance the charge separation efficiency of BiPO4 to achieve a higher photocatalytic activity. However, it cannot effectively shift the light absorption edge to the visible light region. More efforts are still required to efficiently reduce the bandgap of BiPO4 to enable its visible light responsive photocatalysis.
4.3.1.2 BiVO4. 
With a bandgap of 2.4 eV for visible light absorption, bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) is the most attractive bismuth-based semiconductor material for photocatalysis. Amongst its three polymorphic forms of monoclinic, orthorhombic, and tetragonal crystal systems, the monoclinic phase of BiVO4 exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity.220 In this subsection, we only focus on the progress of monoclinic BiVO4 for photocatalysis.
The photocatalytic oxygen evolution properties of BiVO4 in the presence of AgNO3 under visible light illumination were first discovered by Kudo in 1998.221 BiVO4 in this work was prepared by calcining Bi2O3 and NH4VO3 at high temperatures. One year later, Kudo developed a simple aqueous process at room temperature for the synthesis of BiVO4, enabling the systematic investigation on the calcination temperature dependence of the photocatalytic activity of BiVO4 from room temperature to high temperatures.222 It was found that the visible light absorption properties of BiVO4 were attributed to the hybrid Bi 6s and O 2p orbitals in the valence band, which effectively reduced its bandgap. The incorporation of the Bi 6s orbital would be one effective approach for the valence band control to develop visible-light-driven photocatalysts. These findings provided fundamental understanding for the subsequent development of BiVO4 as an important photocatalyst in both powder and photoelectrode-based systems. Despite the excellent visible light absorption properties, the charge separation efficiency in the bulk and the charge transfer efficiency at the surfaces of BiVO4 are still poor, and various strategies have been developed in recent years, in particular for PEC water splitting.28
Nanostructured BiVO4 is favorable for photogenerated electron–hole separation, which can effectively improve the photocatalytic activity of BiVO4. For example, porous olive-like BiVO4 photocatalysts exhibited a high photocatalytic activity for the degradation of phenol in the presence of a small amount of H2O2 under visible light illumination.223 It was believed that the high surface area and surface oxygen vacancy density, porous structure, lower bandgap energy and unique morphology all contributed to the enhanced photocatalytic activity. As shown in Fig. 10a, b, nanoporous BiVO4 achieved a high charge separation efficiency of 90% at 1.23 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5 G illumination for PEC water splitting.224 By surface deposition of dual oxygen evolution cocatalysts of FeOOH/NiOOH, a nanoporous BiVO4/FeOOH/NiOOH photoanode exhibited a high photocurrent density of 4.5 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5 G illumination (Fig. 10c). With further modification of the preparation conditions, nanoworm BiVO4 films with higher transparency were prepared (Fig. 10d).225 By stacking two NiFeOx-Bi-coated nanoworm BiVO4 photoanodes, an applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of 2.25% and stoichiometric H2 and O2 evolution were achieved (Fig. 10e, f). Interestingly, quantum sized BiVO4 exhibited simultaneous H2 and O2 evolutions under simulated solar light illumination in pure water without any cocatalysts or sacrificial reagents (Fig. 10g, h).226 Owing to the quantum confinement effect, the CB of BiVO4 is negatively shifted, resulting in an enlarged bandgap of 2.72 eV, and the CB and VB edges competely cover the redox potential window of water, as shown in Fig. 10i.

Owing to the anisotropic atomic arrangement and coordination on different crystal facets, crystal facet engineering of BiVO4 is also effective to tune its photocatalytic activity. The existence of oxidation and reduction facets for BiVO4 was confirmed by facet-selective photo-deposition of MnOx and Pt NPs.227 Since the energy levels of the {010} and {110} facets are different, the photogenerated electrons are accumulated on the {010} facets, while the photogenerated holes are accumulated on the {110} facets. By selectively depositing Pt NPs on the {010} facets and MnOx NPs on the {110} facets, the photocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution under visible light illumination is significantly improved. The highly anisotropic photogenerated electron–hole separation on the {010} and {110} facets of a single BiVO4 crystal was further confirmed by spatially resolved surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SRSPS) and single-particle photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy.228,229 In addition, 30-faceted BiVO4 polyhedrons predominantly surrounded by high-index {132}, {321}, and {121} facets were prepared by using Au ions as the structure-directing foreign ions, which exhibited a 5-fold enhancement for photocatalytic O2 evolution compared to that of the low-index counterpart (Fig. 11a–c).230 It was found that the enhanced photocatalytic activity was attributed to the energetically favorable water dissociation on the high-index (121), (132) and (231) facets and the significant reduction of the overpotential (0.77–1.14 V) for the OER compared to that of the low-index (010), (110), and (101) facets. Interestingly, an epitaxial BiVO4 film with a crystallographic orientation of (010) showed enhanced PEC performance compared to that of its (001) counterpart, which is attributed to the increased charge separation efficiency.231 Surprisingly, a preferentially [001]-oriented BiVO4 photoanode exhibited a photocurrent density that is approximately 16 times higher than that of its randomly oriented BiVO4 counterpart (Fig. 11d).232 By chemically etching its surfaces to reduce light reflection and depositing a cobalt phosphate (CoPi) oxygen evolution cocatalyst (OEC), an impressive photocurrent density of 6.1 mA cm−2 was achieved at 1.23 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5 G illumination (Fig. 11e, f), corresponding to 82% of the theoretical photocurrent density for BiVO4.

Doping BiVO4 with other elements such as W,233–235 Mo,236–238 and P239 has been confirmed to be effective to improve the charge transport properties in the bulk of BiVO4, leading to enhanced photocatalytic activities. It has been found that W doping in the BiVO4 photoanode can tailor the electron trapping process to obtain a high concentration of reaction sites and less surface recombination, leading to an enhanced PEC performance.240 For example, a distributed n+–n homojunction of BiVO4 was prepared by introducing a gradient dopant concentration of W in the film, exhibiting a charge separation efficiency of 80%.241 By coupling the gradient-W-doped BiVO4/CoPi photoanode with a double-junction amorphous Si solar cell, an unbiased photocurrent density of 4 mA cm−2 was achieved, corresponding to a solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of 4.9%. Encouragingly, the combination of nanostructures and doping strategies is effective to overcome the controversial issue between the short carrier diffusion length and sufficient light absorption. For instance, nanoporous Mo-doped BiVO4 with a larger effective thickness was prepared on an engineered cone-shaped nanostructure substrate, which maintained highly efficient charge separation and high light absorption capability (Fig. 11g, h).242 By depositing a Fe(Ni)OOH layer as the OEC, the nanocone/Mo:BiVO4/Fe(Ni)OOH photoanode exhibited a high photocurrent density of 5.82 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5 G illumination. In addition, an unbiased water splitting system was constructed by connecting the nanocone/Mo:BiVO4/Fe(Ni)OOH photoanode with a single perovskite solar cell in tandem, which generated a photocurrent density of 5.01 mA cm−2 (Fig. 11i), corresponding to a STH efficiency of up to 6.2%.
Similar to extrinsic elemental doping, the generation of oxygen vacancies as shallow donors is also efficient to improve the photocatalytic activity of BiVO4, which has attracted great attention in recent years.243–246 As shown in Fig. 12a–d, a simple electrochemical treatment process was applied to generate oxygen vacancies in BiVO4 films with {040} facets grown vertically on FTO substrates, exhibiting a 10-fold enhancement of photocurrent density compared to its pristine counterpart.247 By depositing a cobalt borate as the cocatalyst, a photocurrent density of 3.2 mA cm−2 was achieved at 1.23 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5 G illumination. The introduction of oxygen vacancies in the BiVO4 films could achieve an excellent back illumination charge separation efficiency.248 After depositing an FeOOH/NiOOH cocatalyst, a dual photoanode configuration composed of two identical oxygen vacancy enriched BiVO4/FeOOH/NiOOH films exhibited an excellent photocurrent density of 5.87 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5 G illumination (Fig. 12e). An unbiased device composed of dual BiVO4/FeOOH/NiOOH photoanodes and a sealed perovskite solar cell achieved a STH efficiency of 6.5% (Fig. 12f–h). Interestingly, a photo-charging process was developed by exposing the BiVO4 films to AM 1.5 G light in a electrolyte solution for 10–20 h, which can generate oxygen vacancies on the surfaces of BiVO4.249,250 Recently, a 10 min photoetching process was developed to generate enriched surface oxygen vacancies in BiVO4 films, which improved the charge separation efficiency by 2.3 times.251 Hydrogen plasma treated BiVO4 films could generate moderate oxygen vacancies, exhibiting a black color with a bandgap reduction of approximately 0.3 eV.252 Compared to conventional BiVO4, black BiVO4 films could significantly improve the solar utilization and charge transport and separation. With the surface deposition of an amorphous TiO2−x layer, a remarkable photocurrent density of 6.12 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE for PEC water splitting was achieved. Recently, dual BiVO4 photoanodes with in situ formed oxygen vacancies in the whole film were fabricated by a sulfur oxidation process, which significantly promote charge separation, leading to an unprecedented photocurrent density of 6.24 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5 G illumination.253

Coupling BiVO4 with other semiconductors to form a heterojunction is effective to improve its charge separation properties. Owing to the excellent band alignment between WO3 and BiVO4, WO3/BiVO4 heterojunctions have shown excellent performance for PEC water splitting and CO2 reduction.255–258 Impressively, a WO3/BiVO4/CoPi core–shell nanostructured photoanode exhibited a record photocurrent density of 6.72 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5 G illumination, corresponding to ∼90% of the theoretically possible value for BiVO4.259 By coupling the WO3/BiVO4/CoPi core–shell nanostructured photoanode with a double junction GaAs/InGaAsP photovoltaic cell, a stable photocurrent density as high as 6.56 mA cm−2 for PEC water splitting was achieved, corresponding to a STH of 8.1%. A CuO-BiVO4@C heterojunction was prepared by growing CuO-BiVO4 on the surfaces of carbon spheres, which exhibited an excellent photocatalytic activity for MB degradation.260 The combination of CuO can improve the light harvesting capability and reduce the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, leading to enhanced photocatalytic activity. Interestingly, decorating a conductive metal oxide of V13O16 on a nanoporous BiVO4 photoanode could efficiently enhance the charge separation and transfer, due to the ohmic contact at the interface of the mixed phases and the superior electrical conductivity from V13O16 (Fig. 12i–k).254 By further depositing a CoPi layer on the BiVO4/V13O16 photoanode, a high photocurrent density of 5.0 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5 G illumination was achieved. Likewise, FeCoOx/BiVO4 (ref. 261) and NiFe-LDH/rGO/BiVO4 (ref. 262) photoanodes also exhibited excellent PEC water splitting performance in terms of photocurrent densities and stability.
In addition, BiVO4 is an excellent oxygen evolution photocatalyst,263,264 which can be coupled with a hydrogen evolution photocatalyst to form Z-scheme junctions for overall water splitting. In particular, a photocatalyst sheet composed of La- and Rh-codoped SrTiO3 (SrTiO3:La, Rh) and Mo-doped BiVO4 (BiVO4:Mo) powders embedded into a gold (Au) layer exhibited a STH efficiency of 1.1% and an apparent quantum yield of over 30% at 419 nm.265 Owing to the similar work function of carbon (5.0 eV) compared to Au (5.1 eV) and less activity for the oxygen reduction reaction, the replacement of the Au layer with a carbon layer to form a SrTiO3:La, Rh/C/BiVO4:Mo sheet could further increase the STH efficiency to 1.2%, which is the best performance amongst all the reported powder photocatalytic overall water splitting systems.266
4.3.1.3 BiNbO4 and BiTaO4. 
Compared to the intensively investigated BiVO4, reports of BiNbO4 and BiTaO4 for photocatalysis are significantly fewer, possibly due to their low photocatalytic activities. Here, we only briefly review the recent progress of these materials.
BiNbO4 photocatalysts were synthesized by a solid-state reaction process, exhibiting photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution in the presence of methanol under UV illumination.267 Interestingly, BiNbO4 showed a higher photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution compared to TiO2 in the absence of Pt cocatalysts. It was also found that BiNbO4 was not stable, which was decomposed into metallic Bi and Nb oxides after photocatalytic applications. Different to BiNbO4, photo-corrosion was not observed in BiTaO4 during a photocatalytic process.268 Attractively, BiTaO4 exhibited very similar photocatalytic activity for MB degradation compared to TiO2−xNx under visible light illumination (λ >420 nm). In addition, BiTa1−xNbxO4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) solid photocatalysts were fabricated by a solid-state reaction process, and the bandgap could be tuned by changing the atomic ratio of Ta/Nb, as shown in Table 1.269 Theoretical calculations revealed that mono- (C) and co-anionic doped (N–N and C–S) BiNbO4 photocatalysts could promote visible light harvesting.270 Systematic investigations on doping BiNbO4 with various metals (i.e., Ga, Ba, Sn, Al and La) and nitrogen, found that Ba, Sn, and Ga promoted the photocatalytic activity under UV and visible light illumination, while La and Al doping exhibited a detrimental effect on the photocatalytic performance.271 In particular, Ba-doped BiNbO4 exhibited higher photocatalytic activity than other doped samples for toluene degradation under visible light illumination, whereas Ga-doped BiNbO4 showed significantly higher photocatalytic performance than other doped samples and TiO2 under UV illumination.

4.3.2 BiOX. 
Bismuth oxyhalides (BiOX, X = F, Cl, Br, I) are composed of a layer structure of [Bi2O2] slabs interleaved by double slabs of halogen atoms. The bandgaps of BiOF, BiOCl, BiOBr and BiOI are 3.64 eV, 3.22 eV, 2.64 eV, and 1.77 eV, respectively.101 Theoretical calculations have shown that the VB of BiOX is composed of both O 2p and X np orbits (n = 2, 3, 4 and 5 for X = F, Cl, Br and I, respectively), while their CB mainly consists of the Bi 6p orbit.272 Therefore, the bandgap and band edge positions can be tailored by tuning the Bi and X contents.
4.3.2.1 BiOF. 
Owing to the large bandgap of 3.64 eV, the light harvesting ability of BiOF is limited in a narrowed UV region, which is not favorable for photocatalysis, and there are only a few reports on the photocatalytic activity of BiOF. For example, tetragonal BiOF was synthesized by a facile precipitation and subsequent calcination process.273 It was found that the calcination temperature affects the crystal phase of the obtained BiOF, and pure tetragonal BiOF was only achieved at 400 °C. For the first time, the photocatalytic activity of BiOF for the degradation of universal organic pollutants was discovered. The internal electric fields between [Bi2O2] slabs and fluorine anionic slabs were believed to promote the photocatalytic activity. Interestingly, BiOF nanodisks with exposed {101} facets instead of the common {001} facets were fabricated by tuning the pH values during the hydrothermal process.274 Compared to BiOF thick plates with exposed {001} facets, the BiOF nanodisks with exposed {101} facets contain more surface oxygen vacancies, which reduces the band gap and increases charge transfer and separation, leading to an approximately 8-fold higher photocatalytic activity for RhB degradation under UV light illumination (λ ≤ 400 nm). A hetero-phase junction composed of BiO0.51F1.98 and BiOF showed enhanced photocatalytic activity for MO degradation, which is attributed to the expanded light absorption edge and increased charge separation.275
4.3.2.2 BiOCl. 
Despite the similar bandgap, BiOCl exhibits higher photocatalytic activity than TiO2.276 The opposite photocatalytic oxidation behaviors of BiOCl and TiO2 were observed.277 It was found that BiOCl photocatalysts tend to decompose perhalocarboxylate acids by direct hole transfer, whereas the oxidation of organic pollutants is caused by the hydroxyl radical using TiO2. Nanostructures also affect the photocatalytic activity of BiOCl. For example, hollow microspheres of BiOCl with a uniform diameter of around 200 nm, an average shell thickness of 40 nm, and basic nanosheets of <20 nm exhibited high photocatalytic activity for RhB degradation under visible light illumination (Fig. 13a, b).278 In addition to the photosensitization effect of RhB and efficient charge separation, the hollow-structure dependent large visible light absorption also contributes to its high photocatalytic activity (Fig. 13c). Moreover, BiOCl hierarchical nanostructures composed of intercrossed nanoflakes or nanosheets exhibited a higher photocatalytic activity than 2D BiOCl nanosheets, nanoplates and commercial BiOCl and TiO2 (anatase).279 The significantly improved photocatalytic activity is attributed to the hierarchical nanostructures, large BET surface areas, strong adsorption capacity and super-hydrophilic properties.

The photocatalytic activity of BiOCl is highly dependent on its facets. For example, 18-faceted BiOCl consisting of {001} top facets and {102} and {112} oblique facets was prepared by a one-pot hydrothermal process (Fig. 13d, e).280 Compared to the conventional BiOCl square plates with exposed {001} top facets and {110} lateral facets, the 18-faceted BiOCl photocatalyst exhibited enhanced photocatalytic performance for the production of H2 and ˙OH (Fig. 13f, g). Detailed investigations revealed that the formation of {001}/{102}/{112} ternary facet junctions facilitates a cascade charge flow, resulting in much higher charge separation and transfer efficiencies. In addition, the selective deposition of another semiconductor material or metallic NPs on different facets of BiOCl also shows various photocatalytic activities. BiOCl(001)/PbS and BiOCl(110)/PbS junctions were prepared by selectively depositing PbS nanocrystals on the (001) and (110) facets of BiOCl nanoplates, respectively, which exhibited very different photocatalytic activity.281 The average H2 generation rate of the BiOCl(110)/PbS photocatalyst is 2.5 times higher than that of its BiOCl(001)/PbS counterpart, which is attributed to the better band alignment at the BiOCl(110)/PbS interface for charge transfer and separation. Interestingly, the photocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution was dramatically improved by selectively depositing Ag NPs on the (001) facets and Pd NPs (110) facets of BiOCl (denoted as Ag-(001)BiOCl(110)-Pd), as demonstrated in Fig. 13h, i.282 The enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to the synergetic utilization of Schottky-junction carrier trapping and plasmonic hot carrier injection in the Ag-(001)BiOCl(110)-Pd photocatalyst (Fig. 13j).
Introducing oxygen vacancies in BiOCl is also effective to improve its photocatalytic activity. Interestingly, oxygen vacancies on different facets of BiOCl also affect the photocatalytic activity. It was found that oxygen vacancies on the BiOCl (010) facets facilitate barrierless O–H bond breaking in the first proton removal reaction, which is sterically hindered if the oxygen vacancies are on the BiOCl (001) facets (Fig. 14a, b).283 In addition, oxygen vacancies on the BiOCl (010) facets also promote more localized electron transfer to the dissociatively adsorbed water, resulting in a higher water activation level for hole trapping. The oxygen vacancy concentration on BiOCl (001) facets could tailor the surface atomic and electronic structures, which affects the photocatalytic pathways.284 As shown in Fig. 14c, d, BiOCl (001) facets with a higher oxygen vacancy concentration have shorter Bi–Bi and Bi–O bond lengths and a larger number of less-localized electrons, which facilitates molecular oxygen activation to generate O22− through a two-electron transfer pathway. Importantly, the generated O22− prevents the over oxidation of amines, leading to a high selectivity in the oxidation of amines to imines. BiOCl/PPy with oxygen vacancies was synthesized by a low-temperature chemical process, which significantly improved the photocatalytic NO removal efficiency from 12% to 28% under visible light illumination.285 In addition, the toxic by-product of NO2 was almost completely inhibited due to the enhancement of oxidation capability for BiOCl with oxygen vacancies.

Coupling BiOCl with other materials is also effective to increase its photocatalytic activity. BiOCl/diatomite composites are composed of BiOCl microspheres with exposed (001) facets evenly dispersed on the surface of diatomite, which not only promotes charge transfer and separation but also provides more active sites for photocatalytic degradation of ciprofloxacin in water.286 3D hierarchical BiOCl/Au was prepared by growing BiOCl nanomaterials on Au butterfly wing scales, exhibiting excellent photocatalytic activity for RhB degradation under visible light illumination.287 The enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to the increased charge separation efficiency and the SPR effect of the 3D structure of Au. Oxygen vacancy-rich 2D/2D BiOCl/g-C3N4 ultrathin heterostructures showed a removal efficiency of 95% for the degradation of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) within 2 h, which is around 12.5, 5.3 and 3.4 times higher than that of the pure BiOCl, g-C3N4 and oxygen vacancy-poor heterostructure, respectively.288 The greatly enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to the synergistic effect between the 2D/2D heterojunction and oxygen vacancies that significantly promotes visible light absorption and charge separation (Fig. 14e, f). Interestingly, a BiOCl homojunction consisting of ultrathin teethlike BiOCl nanosheets selectively deposited on the fringe planes of BiOCl with exposed (001) facets exhibited a superior photocatalytic activity for MO degradation.289 Other BiOCl-based heterojunctions such as Ag NPs/BiOCl,290 Au/BiOCl,291 Pd/BiOCl,292 Bi3O4Cl/BiOCl,293 BiOCl/TiO2/sepiolite,294 and BiOCl/MoS2 (ref. 295) also showed enhanced photocatalytic activities.
4.3.2.3 BiOBr. 
Compared to BiOCl, BiOBr has a narrower bandgap of 2.64 eV, which can absorb visible light. As shown in Fig. 15a, doping BiOBr with Zn could increases its bandgap by lifting the CBM and deepening the VBM.296 Owing to the increased redox power for the photogenerated electron–hole pairs, reduced charge recombination and suppressed back reactions, the photocatalytic water splitting performance of the Zn doped BiOBr photocatalyst is improved (Fig. 15b). However, the change of the bandgap and band edge positions reduces the light absorption and dye-sensitization effects, resulting in decreased photocatalytic activity for RhB degradation (Fig. 15c). A BiOBr0.6Cl0.4 solid solution was synthesized by partially substituting Br with Cl, exhibiting a CO production rate of 15.86 μmol g−1 h−1 with approximate stoichiometric O2 evolution for CO2 reduction under simulated solar light illumination (Fig. 15d, e).297 The enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to the mediate bandgap, suitable band edge positions, and enhanced charge separation, resulting from the formation of BiOBrxCl1−x solid solution. In addition, the photoinduced oxygen vacancies generated in the BiOBrxCl1−x solid solution is also beneficial for CO2 reduction. BiOBr atomic layers with abundant oxygen vacancies were fabricated, in which new defect levels were formed due to the oxygen vacancies, leading to an enhanced visible light absorption edge.298 It was found that oxygen vacancies promote charge separation, and the charge delocalization around the oxygen vacancies facilitates the conversion of CO2 into COOH* intermediates. As a result, the oxygen-vacancy-enriched BiOBr atomic layers exhibited a CO formation rate of 87.4 μmol g−1 h−1 for CO2 reduction under visible light illumination, which is 20 times higher than that of BiOBr atomic layers without oxygen vacancies.

(h) Schematic illustration of charge transfer in LaVO4/BiOBr for the degradation of gaseous air pollutants. Reproduced with permission from ref. 303 Copyright 2020 Elsevier. 
The exposure of facets also affects the photocatalytic activity of BiOBr. For example, BiOBr nanosheets with highly exposed (010) facets were prepared by a hydrothermal process and the thickness of the nanosheet could be tuned by adjusting the pH in the precursor solution.299 It was found that the visible-light photocatalytic activity of these BiOBr nanosheets for decomposing salicylic acid increases with reduced nanosheet thickness. Similarly, BiOBr nanosheets with a tunable exposing proportion of (010) facets were prepared by using different n-alcohols in a hydrothermal process.300 It was found that BiOBr nanosheets prepared in n-hexanol exhibited higher photocatalytic activity than those synthesized in n-butanol or methanol, which is attributed to the higher exposing ratio of (010) facets and the thinner lamellar thickness that promotes the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. As shown in Fig. 15f, BiOBr nanosheets with enriched (010) facets showed higher photocatalytic activity than those with enriched (001) facets under the illumination of light with wavelengths of 365 nm and ≥420 nm.301 Interestingly, under the illumination of light with a wavelength of 254 nm, the opposite photocatalytic activity was observed. The wavelength-dependent photocatalytic activity differences between the (010) and (001) facets of BiOBr were attributed to the differences in the thickness of the nanosheet and the (001) facets of the two BiOBr nanosheets.
The formation of heterojunctions can also promote the photocatalytic activity of BiOBr. For example, a 2D/2D heterojunction of BiOBr/Bi12O17Cl2 was synthesized by a facile in situ chemical deposition–precipitation method, exhibiting a significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity for 4-CP degradation under simulated sunlight illumination.302 The enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to the synergistic effects between BiOBr and Bi12O17Cl2, including an increased surface area, enhanced light harvesting and improved charge separation efficiency. Similarly, a LaVO4/BiOBr heterojunction was synthesized by a facile hydrothermal process, which can improve the light harvesting due to the lower bandgap of LaVO4, exhibiting an improved photocatalytic activity for the degradation of gaseous air pollutants under visible light illumination compared to that of bare LaVO4 and BiOBr (Fig. 15g, h).303 In addition, a ternary junction composed of N-doped carbon quantum dots, ZnFe2O4, and BiOBr (NCQDs/ZFO/BOB) exhibited superior photocatalytic activity for pollutant decomposition, which is attributed to the crucial role of NCQDs as an electron mediator to promote the Z-scheme charge transfer at the interfaces of ZFO and BOB and the up-converted PL properties of NCQDs at the surfaces of ZFO and BOB.304 Other BiOBr based heterojunctions such as BiOBr/MIL-53(Fe),305 BiOBr/BiOCOOH,306 g-C3N4/Carbon dots/BiOBr,307 AgI/BiOBr,308 SrTiO3/BiOBr,309 Ag/BiOBr,310 BiOBr/La2Ti2O7,311 and TiO2/BiOBr312 also showed enhanced photocatalytic activities.
4.3.2.4 BiOI. 
Amongst the BiOX photocatalysts, BiOI has the narrowest bandgap for visible light absorption, which has attracted more attention. Doping BiOI with another halide element or intrinsic defects is effective to tune its bandgap. For example, the bandgap of BiOBrxI1−x photocatalysts could be tailored from 2.28 eV to 1.98 eV by changing the Br/I ratio (Fig. 16a–c).313 Oxygen vacancy-rich ultrathin 2D BiOBrxI1−x solid solution exhibited an excellent photocatalytic activity for the degradation of non-dye organic contaminants.314 The formation of BiOBrxI1−x solid solution promotes visible light absorption and charge separation, while keeping sufficient oxidation capacity for photogenerated holes. In addition, oxygen vacancies in the BiOBrxI1−x solid solution induce an intermediate energy level near the Fermi level, which reduces the bandgap and suppresses the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Introducing oxygen vacancies in {001} BiOI nanosheets was effective to improve their photocatalytic activity, which is attributed to the increased reactive oxygen species production and the enhanced visible light harvesting.315 Interestingly, BiOI nanosheets possess larger-sized vacancies than their nanoplate counterparts, exhibiting an enhanced charge separation efficiency and adsorption ability for photocatalytic tetracycline degradation under visible light illumination.316 A hydrothermal process was applied to prepare BiOI with deposited Bi nanodots, which could generate oxygen vacancies and promote charge separation simultaneously, leading to a higher photocatalytic activity for BPA and MB degradation under visible light illumination.317

The formation of heterojunctions can also effectively enhance the photocatalytic activity of BiOI. For example, Ag/BiOI/TiO2 nanofibrous membranes exhibited an excellent photocatalytic disinfection activity under visible light illumination.318 The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the Ag/BiOI/TiO2 multi-heterojunction is attributed to the large surface area, enhanced visible-light absorption and effective interfacial charge transfer. As shown in Fig. 16d–f, a Bi2WO6/BiOI vertical heterostructure was synthesized by a heteroepitaxial anion exchange method, which exhibited a high photocatalytic activity and stability for NO oxidation under visible light illumination.319 Compared to van der Waals heterostructures lacking an electron shuttle pathway between two adjacent component layers, the obtained Bi2WO6/BiOI vertical heterostructure with chemical bonding can make good use of the linked [Bi2O2]2+ layers as an interfacial charge flow highway, which significantly improves the charge separation efficiency. An iodine vacancy-rich BiOI/Ag@AgI Z-scheme heterojunction was constructed by in situ growing Ag@AgI NPs on the surface of defective BiOI nanosheets, which significantly boosted the photocatalytic efficiency for tetracycline degradation under visible light illumination (Fig. 16g–i).320 The iodine vacancies function as traps for photogenerated holes and the metallic Ag NPs act as mediators for electron transfer, leading to enhanced photocatalytic activity for the iodine vacancy-rich BiOI/Ag@AgI Z-scheme heterojunction. A BiOI/TiO2 heterojunction composed of ultra-small BiOI nanodots and TiO2 nanorods showed significantly improved photocatalytic performance for RhB degradation.321 Similarly, other BiOI-based heterojunctions such as BiOBr/BiOI,322 CdS/rGO/BiOI,323 CuI/BiOI/Cu,324 BiOxCly/BiOmBrn/BiOpIq,325 BiOI/rGO,326 CeO2/BiOI,327 SrCO3/BiOI,328 SnS/BiOI,329 BiOI/ZnO,330 Bi2O3/BiOI,331 BiOI@Bi12O17Cl2,332 and Ag/BiOI333 have also been developed.


4.3.3 Bi2MO6. 
4.3.3.1 Bi2WO6. 
Bi2WO6 is a layer structured material that is composed of perovskite-like [WO4]2− layers sandwiched between [Bi2O2]2+ layers.334 Internal electric fields generated between the slabs can facilitate charge separation. The bandgap of Bi2WO6 is 2.8 eV,335 enabling visible light absorption properties. The investigation of the Bi2WO6 photocatalyst is primarily for organic pollutant degradation.336
Severe charge recombination is the main issue for Bi2WO6 photocatalysts.337 Engineering the morphology, crystal facets and defects can promote the photocatalytic activity of Bi2WO6. As shown in Fig. 17a–c, a novel mesoporous single-crystal-like Bi2WO6 tetragonal architecture was synthesized by a mixed molten salt reaction process, exhibiting an excellent photocatalytic activity for both organic dye degradation and O2 evolution from water under visible light illumination.338 The unique architecture plays a pivotal role in tuning the physical properties, light absorption, photoelectricity and luminescent decay, which considerably enhances its photocatalytic activity. Bi2WO6 with flower-like and pancake-like morphologies was fabricated by a hydrothermal process in the presence of NH4F, exhibiting different photocatalytic activities for RhB degradation under visible light illumination.339 The different photocatalytic activities are attributed to the different surface adsorption properties between the flower-like and pancake-like structures. Bi2WO6 nanostructured bipyramids with a large fraction of {100} facets (B-Bi2WO6) were synthesized by a hydrothermal process, and the SEM and HRTEM images are shown in Fig. 17d, e.340 Interestingly, the formation of “Bi–O′′ dimer vacancy pairs on the {100} high-energy facets could reduce the bandgap and promote charge separation, leading to significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity under solar light illumination (Fig. 17f).

The construction of heterojunctions is another effective strategy to improve the photocatalytic activity of Bi2WO6. A 2D/2D layered P-doped La2Ti2O7/Bi2WO6 heterojunction exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity and cycling performance for RhB degradation under visible light illumination, achieving a degradation efficiency of up to 99.02% within 80 min.342 The enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to the formation of a heterojunction that promotes charge separation. Likewise, a Bi2WO6/Bi2O2S 2D/2D heterojunction composed of a five-alternating-layer (Bi2O2S–Bi2WO6–Bi2O2S–Bi2WO6–Bi2O2S) sandwich structure and a thickness of 5 nm was synthesized by in situ growing the Bi2O2S layer on the surface of monolayer Bi2WO6 nanosheets, which not only produces an over 4-times higher photocurrent density under AM 1.5 G illumination compared to pure Bi2WO6 nanosheets but also generates more than 7-times higher hydrogen in a powder based photocatalytic water splitting system (Fig. 17g–i).341 Owing to the similar structural unit of a [Bi2O2]2+ slice in the Bi2O2S and Bi2WO6 nanosheets, the close bonding between [Bi2O2]2+ in the Bi2WO6 nanosheet and [S]2− in the Bi2O2S nanosheet promotes interfacial charge separation. A GO/TiO2/Bi2WO6 heterojunction exhibited a higher photocatalytic activity for the degradation of gaseous ethylene compared to those of pure TiO2, Bi2WO6 and TiO2/Bi2WO6.343 The incorporation of GO generates an interfacial interaction with TiO2/Bi2WO6, which reduces the charge recombination and enhances the photocatalytic activity. Interestingly, a graphene/Bi2WO6 was synthesized by attaching Bi2WO6 nanocrystals on graphene nanosheets, which exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity for either H2 or O2 generation under visible light illumination.344 Other heterojunctions such as BiPO4/Bi2WO6,345,346 CQDs/Bi2WO6,347,348 MoS2/Bi2WO6,349 Ag@AgCl/Bi2WO6,350 g-C3N4/Bi2WO6,351 and CdS/Bi2WO6 (ref. 352) also showed enhanced photocatalytic activities.
Similarly, Z-scheme junctions generally can keep a high redox power, which is more promising to drive photocatalytic reactions. For example, a Z-scheme junction composed of p-CuAl2O4/n-Bi2WO6 composite nanofibers was constructed by an electrospinning and solvothermal process, exhibiting a desirable photocatalytic performance for overall water splitting and an excellent photocatalytic activity for the degradation of various organic pollutants.353 The enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to the stronger redox power and efficient charge separation in the p-CuAl2O4/n-Bi2WO6 Z-scheme junction. Another ternary Z-scheme junction of meso-tetra (4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (TCPP)/rGO/Bi2WO6 exhibited a significantly improved photocatalytic activity for TC degradation under visible light illumination (λ > 420 nm) compared to its Bi2WO6, rGO/Bi2WO6 and TCPP/Bi2WO6 counterparts.354 It was found that the excellent photocatalytic activity is attributed to the increased charge separation, broadened light absorption and larger surface area. Similarly, a g-C3N4/carbon nanotube (CNT)/Bi2WO6 ternary Z-scheme junction exhibited improved photocatalytic activity for TC degradation, compared to pristine g-C3N4, Bi2WO6, CNT/BWO, CNT/g-C3N4, and g-C3N4/Bi2WO6.355 The formation of a Z-scheme junction facilitates the separation and transfer of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, promoting the photocatalytic process. Interestingly, a double Z-scheme junction of AgBr@Bi2WO6/WO3 could efficiently improve the transfer and separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, exhibiting enhanced photocatalytic activity for RhB degradation.356
4.3.3.2 Bi2MoO6. 
Bismuth molybdate (Bi2MoO6) is a typical Aurivillius structure composed of perovskite-like [MoO4]2− layers sandwiched between [Bi2O2]2+ layers, and the bandgap is 2.7 eV.357 Similar to Bi2WO6, the photocatalytic application of Bi2MoO6 also includes organic degradation.358 Severe charge recombination in the bulk is the main challenging for Bi2MoO6 photocatalysts.359
Forming nanostructures, introducing oxygen vacancies and crystal facet engineering are effective to improve the photocatalytic activity of Bi2MoO6. For example, hierarchical flower-like Bi2MoO6 hollow spheres with oxygen vacancy defects were synthesized by a hydrothermal process, exhibiting an enhanced photocatalytic activity for the degradation of high-noxious pollutants.360 The improved photocatalytic activity is attributed to the synergistic effect of surface defects and the hollow hierarchical structure, which improves visible light absorption and charge separation efficiency. Vertically aligned Bi2MoO6 nanosheet arrays were grown on a ITO substrate by a facile solvothermal process, exhibiting a higher photocurrent density for PEC water splitting compared to their planar counterpart.361 Interestingly, the selective photo-deposition of noble metals (Pt, Au, and Ag) and metal oxides (PbO2, MnOx, and CoOx) on different facets of Bi2MoO6 confirmed that the photogenerated electrons and holes were spatially separated towards the {100} and {001}/{010} facets, respectively (Fig. 18a, b).362 When CoOx was selectively deposited on the hole-rich {001}/{010} facets of Bi2MoO6, a higher oxygen evolution rate was observed compared to its counterpart with randomly deposited CoOx (Fig. 18c). Bi2MoO6 nanosheet arrays with exposed {010} facets exhibited a photocurrent density that is two orders of magnitude higher than that of conventional Bi2MoO6 particles.363

The formation of a heterojunction can also promote charge separation, leading to enhanced photocatalytic activity for Bi2MoO6. For example, a WO3/Bi2MoO6 heterojunction exhibited significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity for RhB and TC degradation compared to Bi2MoO6, WO3 or a mechanical mixture of WO3 and Bi2MoO6 under visible light illumination (Fig. 18d, e).364 It was found that the generation of superoxide free radicals (O2˙−) and photo-generated holes (h+) is mainly responsible for the pollutant degradation. The formation of a heterojunction can increase the visible light utilization and promote charge separation, leading to excellent photocatalytic performance (Fig. 18f). Similarly, Bi2MoO6/Ag-AgCl junctions exhibited higher photocatalytic activity for disinfection than Bi2MoO6 and Bi2MoO6/AgCl under visible light illumination.366 It was found that the plasmonic Ag NPs increase light absorption and work as mediators for the transfer to photogenerated electrons from Bi2MoO6 to AgCl, while AgCl serves as an interfacial catalytic active site for the generation of free radicals, leading to enhanced photocatalytic activity. As shown in Fig. 18g–i, Bi2S3/MoS2/Bi2MoO6 hetero-structured porous films exhibited a dramatically higher PEC performance than the Bi2MoO6, binary Bi2S3/Bi2MoO6 and Bi2S3/MoS2 photoelectrodes for RhB degradation under visible light illumination.365 The synergetic effects of high-quality construction and heterojunction interfaces between the three components were believed to promote the photocatalytic degradation process. Other heterojunctions such as NH2-MIL-125(Ti)@Bi2MoO6,367 Bi2MoO6/ZnO,368 CQD/Bi2MoO6,369 CeO2/Bi2MoO6,370 rGO/Bi2MoO6,371 and Bi2MoO6/Bi2Mo3O12 (ref. 372) also showed enhanced photocatalytic activities.
4.3.3.3 Bi2CrO6. 
Compared to Bi2WO6 and Bi2MoO6 that have a relatively large bandgap of around 2.7 eV, the bandgap of Bi2CrO6 is only 2.0 eV, corresponding to an absorption edge of up to 622 nm in the solar spectrum, which is promising for photocatalysis.373 A hydrothermal process was developed to synthesize Bi2CrO6, exhibiting photocatalytic activity for MB degradation under visible light illumination.373 However, its photocatalytic activity was significantly hindered by severe charge recombination due to the very short lifetime of the photogenerated carriers (0.66 ns).373 In addition, the photocatalytic activity of one-dimensional Bi2O3/Bi2CrO6 nanowires was also reported for MB degradation under visible light illumination.374 Reports of experimental studies on Bi2CrO6 for photocatalysis are very rare. To further promote the development of this material, more fundamental studies are still required to deeply understand the mechanism of charge separation in Bi2CrO6. Like many other photocatalysts, strategies such as doping and defect engineering may be effective to tailor the electronic structure of Bi2CrO6 to promote charge separation.


4.3.4 BiMO3. 
4.3.4.1 BiFeO3. 
Bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3) has a perovskite structure (ABO3) composed of A-site ferroelectricity and B-site magnetism.375 The polarization in BiFeO3 is mainly because of the stereochemically active lone pair (s2 orbital) of Bi3+ ions, whereas the magnetization is mainly derived from the Fe3+ ion. The bandgap of BiFeO3 is 2.1–2.7 eV,376 which can be activated by visible light. Currently, BiFeO3 is primarily applied for photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants, and strategies such as forming nanostructures and heterojunctions and doping have been developed to improve its photocatalytic activity.
As shown in Fig. 19a–c, BiFeO3 NPs with sizes of 80–120 nm were fabricated by a facile sol–gel process, exhibiting a significantly higher photocatalytic activity than bulk BiFeO3 for MO degradation under UV-vis light illumination.377 The enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to the higher surface area for the nanosized BiFeO3. Interestingly, the BiFeO3 NPs showed weak ferromagnetism, which is different from the magnetic properties of bulk BiFeO3. In addition, the nanostructure of BiFeO3 affects its light absorption properties. For example, the bandgaps of BiFeO3 with mat and mesh structures were 2.44 eV and 2.39 eV, respectively.378 It was found that the photocatalytic activity of the BiFeO3 mesh is higher than that of the mat one for dye degradation, which is attributed to the reduced bandgap and an enhanced semiconductor band-bending that promotes the transfer of photogenerated charge carriers. Interestingly, introducing mechanical stress into BiFeO3 nanosheets and nanowires to induce the piezoelectric effect could significantly improve their photocatalytic activities for RhB degradation, which is attributed to the internal piezoelectric-field-induced bias and its influence on suppressing the electron–hole recombination.379

Gd Doped BiFeO3 NPs exhibited obvious magnetization hysteresis loops that were different from the linear magnetization hysteresis curve for pure BiFeO3 NPs, which is attributed to the distorted spin cycloid and magnetically active properties of Gd3+ ions.382 An appropriate amount of Gd doping led to enhanced photocatalytic activity for RhB degradation under visible light illumination. Impressively, Ba-doped BiFeO3 exhibited a significantly reduced bandgap of 1.79 eV and an increased magnetic saturation value, leading to an enhanced photocatalytic activity for the removal of benzene under visible light illumination (Fig. 19d–f).380 Similarly, Co-doping BiFeO3 with La3+ and Se4+ could significantly reduce its bandgap from 2.06 eV to 1.94 eV and improve the charge separation efficiency, leading to a higher photocatalytic activity compared to pure BiFeO3.383
A CuS/BiFeO3 heterojunction photocatalyst exhibited excellent visible light absorption and superior charge separation compared to the individual components.381 In addition, the formation of a heterojunction also leads to high mobility of excitons across grain boundaries. As a result, the CuS/BiFeO3 heterojunction showed a high photocatalytic activity for the mineralization of alachlor under visible light illumination, achieving >95% degradation within 60 min (Fig. 19g–i). Likewise, well-aligned BiFeO3/TiO2-nanotube (NT) arrays were prepared by decorating BiFeO3 NPs on the walls of TiO2 nanotube arrays, exhibiting stronger visible light absorption properties and a much higher photoconversion efficiency for the degradation of RhB than the pure TiO2-NT array counterpart under visible light illumination.384 In addition, a Z-scheme junction of Ag/FeTiO3/Ag/BiFeO3 exhibited an excellent photocatalytic activity for the degradation of norfloxacin.385 It was found that Ag/FeTiO3/Ag/BiFeO3 can produce active species including hydroxyl radicals (˙OH), holes (h+) and superoxide radicals (˙O2−) during the photocatalytic process, leading to excellent photocatalytic activity.
4.3.4.2 BiYO3 and BaBiO3. 
Bismuth yttrium oxide (BiYO3) has a perovskite structure with a bandgap of 2.36–2.84 eV.386,387 Despite the visible light absorption properties, BiYO3 exhibits poor photocatalytic activity due to the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Strategies such as doping and synthesizing heterojunctions have been developed to improve its photocatalytic activity. For example, Nd-doped BiYO3 nanotubes were synthesized by an electrospinning technique with subsequent calcination, which exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol and degradation of Congo red under visible light illumination.388 The improved photocatalytic activity was attributed to the nanotube structure, suitable bandgap and Nd doping, leading to excellent light harvesting, matter diffusion and carrier transfer. An AgI-BiYO3 heterojunction was synthesized by an ultrasound-assisted precipitation method, exhibiting excellent photocatalytic activity for Reactive orange16 (RO16) degradation under UV and visible light.389 Similarly, a g-C3N4/BiYO3 heterojunction exhibited a higher photocatalytic activity than the individual g-C3N4 or BiYO3 alone for H2 evolution, due to the formation of a heterojunction that promotes charge separation.390
BaBiO3 with a perovskite structure has a bandgap of 2.05 eV, which exhibited excellent photocatalytic activities for the degradation of various organic contaminants, including acetaldehyde and methylene blue dye, and generated high photocurrent densities whenever under UV-light or visible-light illumination.391 Visible-active BaBiO3 perovskite photocatalysts were synthesized by solid state and hydrothermal processes, which could be used for water splitting and RhB degradation under visible light illumination.392 It was found that the photocatalytic activity of the BaBiO3 perovskite photocatalyst is mainly determined by its crystallinity. A BaBiO3/NaTaO3 heterojunction exhibited an enhancement in charge transfer, leading to an improved photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution with a hydrogen generation rate of 54 μmol g−1.393
Although BiYO3 and BaBiO3 have suitable bandgaps for visible light harvesting, the photocatalytic activity of these materials has not been fully realized. More fundamental understanding of the electronic structure, charge transfer and separation of these materials is still required. Appropriate strategies should be developed to effectively increasing their charge separation performances towards efficient photocatalysis.


4.3.5 Bismuth titanate. 
Bismuth titanate including Bi4Ti3O12 (bandgap: 3.0–3.5 eV),394 Bi2Ti2O7 (bandgap: 2.95 eV),395 Bi12TiO20 (bandgap: 2.4 eV),396 and Bi20TiO32 (bandgap: 2.38 eV)397 have been reported for photocatalysis. Compared to other ternary bismuth compounds, the investigations of bismuth titanate for photocatalysis are significantly fewer, possibly due to the complicated structure. In this subsection, we will briefly review the progress of bismuth titanate for photocatalysis.
As shown in Fig. 20a, single-crystalline Bi4Ti3O12 nanosheets with exposed {001} facets were synthesized by a self-catalyzed fast reaction process (denoted as BTO-SF-280).398Fig. 20b reveals that the obtained Bi4Ti3O12 nanosheets exhibited a high photocatalytic activity for MO degradation under visible light illumination, which is approximately 4 fold higher than that of Bi4Ti3O12 nanosheets synthesized by a traditional molten salt process (denoted as BTO-MT-800). It was found that Bi4Ti3O12 nanosheets synthesize by a self-catalyzed fast reaction process contain oxygen vacancies on the surfaces, which reduces the bandgap and promotes charge separation (Fig. 20c). Single-crystalline Bi4Ti3O12 nanosheets with a rectangular shape and exposed {001} facets were prepared by a sol–gel hydrothermal process, exhibiting a photocatalytic degradation efficiency of 79.2% for RhB under 90 min of sunlight illumination, which was 3 fold that of traditionally calcined Bi4Ti3O12.399 The significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity of the Bi4Ti3O12 nanosheets is attributed to the larger number of active sites and improved charge separation efficiency.

In addition of the exposed facets, the particle size and morphology also affect the photocatalytic activity. Various sized Bi4Ti3O12 nanosheets with exposed {001} facets were synthesized by a molten salt process in the presence of different amounts of NaCl and KCl (demoted as BTO-M, M referred to the molar ratio of NaCl:KCl).400 It was found that Bi4Ti3O12 nanosheets with the smallest side length and thickness exhibit the highest photocatalytic activity for RhB degradation (Fig. 20d). The short charge transport distance and favorable internal electric fields contribute to the enhanced photocatalytic activity (Fig. 20e). Crystalline Bi2Ti2O7 porous microspheres exhibited higher photocatalytic activity for the degradation of p-chlorophenol and RhB under visible light illumination compared to Bi2Ti2O7 synthesized by chemical solution decomposition, which is attributed to the larger surface area and higher crystallization that promote reactant adsorption and charge separation (Fig. 20f–h).401 Spherical Bi12TiO20 NPs had higher surface areas, exhibiting a higher photocatalytic activity for the degradation of AO7 under visible light illumination.402
As shown in Fig. 21a, b, Cr-doped Bi4Ti3O12 nanosheets with exposed {001} facets could show effectively enhanced photocatalytic activity, in which the optimized Bi4Ti2.6Cr0.4O12 nanosheets exhibited a hydrogen evolution rate of 117 μmol g−1 h−1, which was 2.85 fold higher than that of the Bi4Ti3O12 nanosheets.403 The improved photocatalytic activity is attributed to the increased visible light absorption capability (Fig. 21c), small nanosheet size, exposed {001} facets, and suppressed charge recombination. Likewise, Fe-doped Bi4Ti3O12 nanosheets with exposed {001} facets were fabricated by a one-step molten salt method.404 By further decorating Au NPs on the surfaces (Fig. 21d), a high photocatalytic activity for the degradation of Phenol and BPA was observed. It was found that the doped Fe3+ ion functions as an efficient scavenger to trap electrons, promoting charge separation, while the SPR effect of Au NPs improves the visible light absorption, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activities (Fig. 21e). Likewise, doping Bi2Ti2O7 with different amounts of Fe could tune its bandgap in the range of 1.6–2.6 eV, exhibiting an enhanced photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution.405 V-doped Bi4Ti3O12 with exposed {001} facets was prepared by a sol–gel hydrothermal process, which exhibited a red-shift in the visible light absorption range compared to pure Bi4Ti3O12, leading to an enhanced photocatalytic performance for RhB degradation.406

Coupling bismuth titanate with other n-type semiconductors to form type-II heterojunctions is effective to promote charge separation. For example, Bi4Ti3O12/TiO2 heterojunctions were prepared by growing Bi4Ti3O12 nanosheets on the surface of TiO2 submicron fibers, exhibiting a significantly higher photocatalytic activity for RhB degradation than the unmodified TiO2 submicron fibers under visible light illumination.408 The improved photocatalytic activity is attributed to the extended visible light absorption and the effective charge separation. Similarly, a 3D Bi12TiO20/TiO2 hierarchical heterostructure also showed enhanced photocatalytic activity for RhB degradation.409 In addition, a flower-like BiVO4/Bi2Ti2O7 heterojunction also showed improved photocatalytic activity and recycling ability for the removal of tetracycline.410 A ternary heterojunction of g-C3N4/Bi4Ti3O12/Bi2Ti2O7 exhibited an enhanced photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution under visible light illumination.411 The optimized loading of Bi4Ti3O12/Bi2Ti2O7 nanorods on g-C3N4 enlarged the light absorption range and promoted charge separation and transfer, resulting from the formation of an intrinsic electric field between the [Bi2O2]2+ slabs and the [Bim−1TiO3m+1] units in Bi2Ti2O7 and Bi4Ti3O12.
In addition, the formation of p–n or Z-scheme junctions is also efficient to enhance the photocatalytic activity. For example, a g-C3N4/Bi4Ti3O12 p–n junction exhibited superior photocatalytic performance in the removal of AO7 under visible light illumination, which is attributed to the formation of an internal electrostatic field in the p–n junction.412 Another CuFe2O4/Bi4Ti3O12 p–n heterojunction was fabricated by a ball milling process, exhibiting a higher photocatalytic performance than Bi4Ti3O12 alone for MO degradation.413 CuS/Bi4Ti3O12 p–n junctions with flower like hierarchical structures were synthesized and exhibited an enhanced photocatalytic activity for aqueous phase degradation of 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA) herbicide under visible light illumination.414 As shown in Fig. 21f–h, a Z-scheme junction of hierarchical Ag/AgCl@Bi20TiO32 exhibited higher photocatalytic activities than Ag-AgCl nanocrystals and mesoporous Bi20TiO32 nanosheets for the degradation of RhB and AO7 dyes, which is attributed to the SPR effect of Ag NPs and the formation of a Z-scheme junction for efficient charge separation.407 Similarly, an Ag-AgBr@Bi20TiO32 Z-scheme junction also showed enhanced photocatalytic activity for the degradation of isoproturon.415


4.3.6 Bi2O2CO3. 
Bismuth subcarbonate (Bi2O2CO3) has a wide bandgap of 3.1–3.5 eV,416 leading to low light harvesting for photocatalysis. The detailed synthesis and applications of nanostructured Bi2O2CO3 have been reviewed.30 In this subsection, we only focus on the development of strategies such as doping, introducing defects and forming heterojunctions for enhancing the photocatalytic activity of Bi2O2CO3.
N-doped Bi2O2CO3 could significantly reduce the bandgap from 3.37 to 3.09 eV, leading to an enhanced photocatalytic activity for RhB degradation and NO oxidation compared to pristine Bi2O2CO3 under visible light illumination.417 Interestingly, CO32−-doped Bi2O2CO3 (C-BOC) could continuously tune its light absorption from UV to visible light (Fig. 22a, b).418 Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the doping of CO32− can lower the CB position and generate an impurity level, which can effectively reduce the bandgap of Bi2O2CO3. The CO32−-doped Bi2O2CO3 exhibited excellent photocatalytic activities for the degradation of BPA (Fig. 22c), which is superior to that of pristine Bi2O2CO3, P25, C3N4, and BiOBr. Similarly, doping Bi2O2CO3 with I− could generate two intermediate levels in its forbidden band, which can effectively reduce its bandgap, leading to enhanced photocatalytic activities for RhB degradation and Cr(VI) removal under visible light illumination.419 Bi2O2CO3 with oxygen vacancies was synthesized by a facile hydrothermal process in the presence of NaBiO3 and g-C3N4.420 It was found that the defect density of oxygen vacancies on the surfaces of Bi2O2CO3 is negatively correlated with the amount of g-C3N4. Interestingly, oxygen vacancies generated a defect level in the forbidden band, which not only increases the visible light harvesting but also suppresses the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Consequently, the photocatalytic activity for N2 fixation is significantly improved, which is over 9 times higher than that of its pristine Bi2O2CO3 counterpart (Fig. 22d, e).

As shown in Fig. 22f, a Bi2O4/Bi2O2CO3 heterostructure was prepared by an epitaxial growth strategy, exhibiting full spectrum light (UV, visible and NIR lights) responsive properties.421 Owing to the similar work functions for Bi2O4 (4.295 eV) and Bi2O2CO3 (4.410 eV), the transfer and separation of photogenerated carriers at the interfaces of Bi2O4/Bi2O2CO3 are favorable (Fig. 22g), leading to enhanced photocatalytic activity for the degradation of phenol and ciprofloxacin (CIP). Likewise, a Bi4O7/Bi2O2CO3 heterojunction also showed enhanced photocatalytic activity for RhB degradation under visible light illumination.422 A Co3O4/Bi2O2CO3 p–n junction was synthesized by a facile hydrothermal process, exhibiting an enhanced photocatalytic activity for naphthalene degradation under visible light illumination.423 Owing to the incorporation of Co3O4 and the formation of Co3O4/Bi2O2CO3 p–n junctions, the visible light absorption and charge separation efficiencies have been improved. Similarly, a Bi2O2CO3/ZnFe2O4 p–n heterojunction also showed enhanced photocatalytic activity for the removal of NO under visible light illumination.424 A Z-scheme junction of CdS/BiOBr/Bi2O2CO3 composed of well dispersed CdS NPs (50–80 nm) decorating on ultrathin BiOBr and Bi2O2CO3 nanoplates with a high interfacial contact showed significantly improved visible light absorption, prolonged lifetime decay and promoted charge separation and transfer, leading to an excellent photocatalytic activity for decomposing atrazine herbicide.425 Interestingly, a Z-scheme BiO1−xBr/Bi2O2CO3 photocatalyst with enriched oxygen vacancies was prepared, exhibiting significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity for antibiotics degradation.426 The formation of oxygen vacancies in the Z-scheme system function as electron mediators, which can significantly promote charge separation. In addition, the enhanced redox capability of photogenerated carriers resulting from the Z-scheme junction can produce superoxide radicals (˙O2−) and hydroxyl radicals (˙OH), which is beneficial for the degradation of pollutants. Other heterojunctions such as Bi2O2CO3/MoS2,427 Bi2O2CO3/g-C3N4,428 and AgI/Bi2O2CO3 (ref. 429) also showed enhanced visible light responsive photocatalytic activity.


4.3.7 MBi2O4. 
4.3.7.1 CuBi2O4. 
CuBi2O4 is a p-type semiconductor with a bandgap of 1.5–1.8 eV, corresponding to a theoretical maximum current density of 19.7 mA cm−2 under AM 1.5 G illumination. Poor charge transport in CuBi2O4 is a key issue, which leads to severe charge recombination and self-reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+, resulting in poor photocatalytic activity and stability.430
CuBi2O4 has been investigated as a photocathode material for PEC water splitting, and the crystal structure, morphology, Cu/Bi ratio, and Cu vacancies affect its PEC performance. For example, high-quality nanoporous CuBi2O4 films were prepared by a spin-coating process, exhibiting a photocurrent density of 2.45 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V vs. RHE in the presence of H2O2 due to enhanced light absorption and a shortened carrier diffusion pathway.431 By tuning the Cu/Bi ratio to 0.55, a higher photocurrent density of 2.66 mA cm−2 was achieved. Interestingly, irradiation of CuBi2O4 with hν ≥ 2.7 eV in an inert atmosphere could induce the formation of reduced Cu on the surfaces.432 It was found that the surface states and the reduced Cu species trigger a downward band bending of 0.35 eV, promoting charge separation and transfer. As a result, an enhanced PEC performance towards H2O2 reduction was observed. Post-annealing a CuBi2O4 thin film in a hypoxic atmosphere generated a higher carrier concentration in the film, leading to a significantly enhanced photocurrent density.433 The treatment may generate defects in the CuBi2O4 film, which was not studied in this work. As shown in Fig. 23a, b, CuBi2O4 photocathodes with a forward gradient doping of copper vacancies were fabricated, exhibiting a high photocurrent density of up to 2.5 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V vs. RHE in the presence of H2O2.434 With the surface deposition of CdS/TiO2/Pt, the forward gradient self-doped CuBi2O4/CdS/TiO2/Pt photocathode achieved a photocurrent density of 1.0 mA cm−2 at 0.0 V vs. RHE for water splitting with a faradaic efficiency of 91% (Fig. 23c).

The formation of a heterojunction can also promote the photocatalytic activity of CuBi2O4. For example, a CuBi2O4/CuO photocathode with a type II heterojunction was prepared (Fig. 23d–f), exhibiting a photocurrent density of 1.49 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5 G illumination, which is over 2 times higher than that of its pristine CuBi2O4 counterpart.435 Interestingly, an anodization treatment could further enhance the photocurrent density to 1.87 mA cm−2. By coupling with a BiVO4/Co-Pi photoanode, unbiased PEC water splitting was achieved (Fig. 23g). Likewise, CuO phase segregation in a CuBi2O4 photocathode induced the formation of a type-II CuO/CuBi2O4 heterojunction, leading to a 25% enhanced photocurrent density under AM 1.5 G illumination in the presence of Na2S2O8.437 The deposition of a very thin and transparent p-type Cu doped NiO layer on the FTO substrate as a hole selective back contact layer for CuBi2O4 photocathodes could significantly enhance their PEC performance, exhibiting a high photocurrent density of 2.83 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5 G illumination in the presence of H2O2 (Fig. 23h, i).436 As shown in Fig. 23j, k, the band alignment in FTO/Cu:NiO/CuBi2O4 is better than that in FTO/CuBi2O4 for the transfer of photogenerated holes, leading to enhanced PEC performance.
In addition to PEC water splitting, CuBi2O4-based heterojunctions have also been applied for photocatalytic inactivation of bacteria and degradation of organic pollutants. For example, a CuBi2O4/Bi2MoO6 p–n junction exhibited significantly enhanced photocatalytic inactivation for E. coli cells under visible light illumination (λ > 420 nm) compared to pure CuBi2O4 and Bi2MoO6.438 The improved photocatalytic activity is attributed to the suppression of charge recombination and the generation of more reactive species (˙O2−). A flower-flake-sphere-like CuBi2O4/WO3 hybrid photocatalyst was synthesized by a precursor-guided hydrothermal process, exhibiting a higher photocatalytic activity for tetracycline degradation under simulated solar light illumination compared to bulk CuBi2O4 and WO3, respectively.439 The formation of a direct Z-scheme junction between CuBi2O4 and WO3 was proposed, which promotes charge separation and generates numerous active species such as ˙OH and ˙O2− for pollutant degradation. CuBi2O4/CuO heterojunctions were synthesized by a one-step solvothermal process, exhibiting enhanced photocatalytic activities for the degradation of MB dye and metronidazole (MTZ) compared to CuBi2O4 and CuO.440 The improved photocatalytic activity is attributed to the formation of a type-II heterojunction that promotes charge separation between CuBi2O4 and CuO. Other CuBi2O4 based heterojunctions such as CuBi2O4/Bi3ClO4,441 α-Bi2O3/CuBi2O4,442 AgX (X = I, Br)/CuBi2O4,443 and Ag3PO4/CuBi2O4 (ref. 444) also showed enhanced photocatalytic activities.
4.3.7.2 CaBi2O4. 
CaBi2O4 has a bandgap of 3.08 and can be synthesized by a solid-state reaction process.445 Owing to the requirement of high temperature and a long time for calcination and a series of other Ca–Bi–O compounds such as Ca6Bi6O15, Ca4Bi6O13 and Ca5Bi14O26,445 the preparation of pure CaBi2O4 is not an easy task, which may hinder the development of CaBi2O4 for photocatalysis. So far, only very few studies on the photocatalytic activity of CaBi2O4 have been reported. For example, CaBi2O4 photocatalysts were synthesized by a simple wet chemical method, followed by a subsequent high temperature calcination process, exhibiting higher photocatalytic activity than TiO2 for MB degradation under visible light illumination.446 It was found the activity and crystal structure of CaBi2O4 did not change after a series of continuous investigations under different experimental conditions. A dumbbell-shaped CaBi2O4 nanostructure film was applied for PEC water splitting, exhibiting a photocurrent density of 1.19 mA cm−2.447 The high PEC performance was attributed to the excellent light absorption and efficient charge separation and collection.
To promote the development of CaBi2O4 for photocatalysis, more facile approaches for material synthesis should be developed. In addition, the bandgap of CaBi2O4 is relatively large, which restricts its visible light harvesting. Thus, the development of efficient strategies to reduce the bandgap of CaBi2O4 is also important to further promote its photocatalytic activity.


4.3.8 Pentavalent bismuthates. 
Pentavalent bismuth ions (Bi5+) have an empty 6 s orbital but still have a d10 closed shell, exhibiting different electronic structures compared with the trivalent (Bi3+) bismuthates discussed in the previous sections.448 In this subsection, we will briefly introduce two types of pentavalent bismuthates, i.e., MBiO3 (M = Li, Na, K, Ag) and MBi2O6 (M = Mg, Zn, Sr, Ba, Ca).
4.3.8.1 MBiO3. 
The bandgaps of KBiO3, LiBiO3, NaBiO3 and AgBiO3 are summarized in Table 2.449–451 The research of these materials is mainly on photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants.

The photocatalytic activities of MBiO3 nanostructured photocatalysts have been reported. For example, LiBiO3 exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity for the degradation of MB under the illumination of white fluorescent light.452 Similarly, the photocatalytic activity of KBiO3 in the degradation of RhB, crystal violet (CV), MB and phenol under visible light illumination was also reported.453 NaBiO3 exhibited photocatalytic activity for RhB degradation under visible light illumination.454 Interestingly, the photocatalytic activity of NaBiO3·2H2O was higher than that of its heated NaBiO3 counterpart, indicating the important role of crystal water contained in the catalyst for photocatalysis. It was found that chromophore cleavage predominated over N-deethylation is the major reaction route for the photodegradation of RhB using NaBiO3·2H2O photocatalysts. AgBiO3 NPs could produce superoxide radicals, exhibiting excellent photocatalytic activities for the degradation of 4-nitrophenol and inactivation of E. coli.455
In addition, strategies such as doping and forming heterojunctions have been developed to promote the photocatalytic activities of MBiO3 photocatalysts. For example, Bi3+-self-doped NaBiO3 nanosheets exhibited significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity for the degradation of RhB and BPA under visible light illumination compared to NaBiO3·2H2O, which is attributed to the increased visible light absorption and charge separation.456 Interestingly, an AgSb0.8125Bi0.1875O3 solid-solution exhibited an ideal bandgap of 2.0 eV and a strong oxidizing potential, which is a promising candidate for oxygen evolution in a Z-scheme water splitting system.457 In addition, hierarchical nanoplate-like BiOCl/LiBiO3 p–n junctions were fabricated by a facile in situ formation process, exhibiting a higher photocatalytic activity than single BiOCl or LiBiO3 for RhB degradation under visible light illumination.458 Likewise, KBiO3/g-C3N4 heterojunctions showed enhanced photocatalytic activity.459
Although the bandgaps of MBiO3 are promising for photocatalysis, studies on these semiconductors are very rare, and the related research is mainly focused on the degradation of organic pollutants or the inactivation of bacteria. The applications of MBiO3 photocatalysts for other more challenging photocatalytic reactions such as water splitting and CO2 reduction are yet to be investigated. More fundamental understanding of the electronic structures, charge transfer and separation processes of these semiconductor materials is still required.
4.3.8.2 MBi2O6. 
Compared to MBiO3, MBi2O6 semiconductors have a narrower bandgap, as listed in Table 3.460–462 However, studies of MBi2O6 for photocatalysis are significantly fewer. For example, BaBi2O6 exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity for phenol degradation under visible light illumination.462 The construction of heterojunctions can promote the photocatalytic activities. For example, a AgBr/MgBi2O6 heterojunction exhibited significantly improved photocatalytic activities for MB degradation under visible light illumination compared to that of pristine MgBi2O6 and AgBr.463 Similarly, ZnBi2O6/graphene oxide junctions could promote charge separation and increase the adsorption capability of dyes, exhibiting higher photocatalytic activities than pristine ZnBi2O6.464

4.4 Other bismuth compounds

4.4.1 Layered perovskites. 
4.4.1.1 Double-layered Sillén–Aurivillius perovskite oxychlorides. 
Double-layered Sillén–Aurivillius perovskite oxychlorides with a formula of Bi4MO8X (M = Nb and Ta, X = Cl, Br, I) are another type of bismuth-based semiconductor material. Theoretical calcinations revealed that the bandgaps of Bi4NbO8Cl, Bi4NbO8Br, Bi4NbO8I, Bi4TaO8Cl, Bi4TaO8Br, and Bi4TaO8I are 2.40, 2.45, 2.51, 2.49, 2.53, and 2.74, respectively, as shown in Fig. 24.465
 Fig. 24  Crystal structure of Bi4MO8X and their bandgaps and band edge positions. Reproduced with permission from ref. 465 Copyright 2017 American Chemical Society. 
Experimental studies for photocatalysis of Bi4MO8X were also realized. As shown in Fig. 25a–c, a Bi4NbO8Cl photocatalyst was stable and efficient for O2 evolution under visible light illumination, enabling Z-scheme overall water splitting by coupling with Rh-doped SrTiO3.466 It was demonstrated that the VB of Bi4NbO8Cl is unusually high due to the highly dispersive O 2p orbitals rather than the Cl 3p orbitals, leading to a narrow bandgap and stability during water oxidation under visible light illumination. Similarly, a Z-scheme junction composed of RuO2/Bi4NbO8Cl, Ru/SrTiO3:Rh and the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox mediator exhibited overall water splitting for the production of H2 and O2 under visible light illumination.467 Another Z-scheme junction of g-C3N4/Bi4NbO8Cl exhibited a significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution under visible light illumination compared to bare g-C3N4 and Bi4NbO8Cl.468 However, the O2 evolution properties were not mentioned in that study. In addition, a 2D/2D Bi4NbO8Cl/g-C3N4 heterojunction also showed excellent photocatalytic activities for CO2 reduction and organic pollutant degradation.469 Likewise, a direct Z-scheme of Bi4TaO8Cl/W18O49 also exhibited photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction.470 The CO yield of Bi4TaO8Cl/W18O49 was significantly enhanced by 87 times when the reactor was heated at 393 K compared to its room temperature counterpart. Surprisingly, Bi4TaO8Cl/W18O49 also exhibited long-lasting CO2 reduction in the dark after light illumination, which was attributed to the thermal release of stored electrons in W18O49 to the CB of Bi4TaO8Cl.

(c) Z-scheme water splitting coupled with a Ru/SrTiO3:Rh photocatalyst via an Fe3+/Fe2+ redox mediator. Reproduced with permission from ref. 466 Copyright 2016 American Chemical Society. 
Interestingly, the product of the transient pseudo-photoconductivity maximum (φΣμmax) and half-lifetime (τ1/2) obtained by time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) measurements could be used to examine the O2 evolution properties of Bi4TaO8Cl.471 Gd-doped Bi4TaO8Cl exhibited higher photocatalytic activity than pure Bi4TaO8Cl for MB degradation under visible light illumination, which is attributed to the lower bandgap and higher charge separation and transfer efficiencies.472 In addition to Bi4NbO8Cl and Bi4TaO8Cl, the reports of other semiconductor materials for photocatalysis are much less. Bi4NbO8Br with a bandgap of 2.34 eV was synthesized by a solid-state reaction process, exhibiting photocatalytic activity for RhB degradation under visible light illumination.473 The photocatalytic activity of Bi4TaO8I for the degradation of MO and pentachlorophenol under visible light was also observed.474
4.4.1.2 Aurivillius type layered perovskites. 
Aurivillius type layered perovskites including Sr2Bi2Nb2TiO12,475 SrBi2Ta2O9,476 and PbBi2Nb2O9 (ref. 477) have been developed for photocatalysis. Interestingly, these layered perovskites can form an internal static electric field to promote charge transfer in the interlayer.475 In addition, they also can be delaminated to ultrathin nanosheets, which is favorable for fast migration of photogenerated carriers. For example, Sr2Bi2Nb2TiO12 nanosheets were fabricated by a hydrothermal process, and oxygen vacancies were generated by the subsequent glyoxal-assisted reduction treatment process.475 Impressively, such Sr2Bi2Nb2TiO12 nanosheets with the optimized oxygen vacancy concentration exhibited a high CO evolution rate of 17.11 mmol g−1 h−1, which was 58 times higher than that of their bulk counterpart. It was found that oxygen vacancies can expand the light absorption, promote charge separation and increase surface reactive sites for CO2 adsorption and activation, leading to significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction. Excitingly, PbBi2Nb2O9 exhibited high photocatalytic activities for the degradation of organic pollutants, generation of photocurrent, and water splitting into O2 or H2, all under visible right illumination (λ ≥ 420 nm).477 Similarly, Ce-doped SrBi2Ta2O9 also showed photocatalytic activity for H2 and O2 evolution from aqueous solutions containing sacrificial reagents under UV illumination.478


4.4.2 Bismuth halide perovskites. 
Bismuth halide perovskite materials have advantages such as non-toxicity, stability in ambient air and a humid environment, and low-temperature solution processability and have been considered as a good choice to address the toxicity issue of lead-based halide perovskites for photovoltaic applications.479–482 However, owing to their instability in aqueous solution, the development of bismuth halide perovskite materials for photocatalytic application is much slower than the photovoltaic field. In this subsection, we will overview the recent progress of bismuth halide perovskite materials for photocatalysis.
As shown in Fig. 26a, a series of nontoxic and stable bismuth-based perovskite nanocrystals of A3Bi2I9 (A+ = Rb+ or Cs+ or CH3NH3+ (MA+)) were synthesized and their photocatalytic activities for CO2 reduction were investigated.483 It was found Cs3Bi2I9 exhibited the best photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction, producing 14.9 μmol g−1 of methane and 77.6 μmol g−1 of CO, which are significantly higher than those of TiO2 (P25) under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 26b, c). A double perovskite of Cs2AgBiBr6 exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity for the degradation of dyes such as RhB, Rh110, MR, and MO in an alcohol-based photocatalytic system, which is comparable to that of CdS.484 Moreover, decorating metal clusters on Cs2AgBiBr6 could further enhance the photocatalytic activity, but the stability was not satisfactory. In addition, Cs2AgBiBr6 double perovskite nanocrystals were also applied for photocatalytic CO2 reduction, exhibiting a total electron consumption of 105 μmol g−1 under AM 1.5 G illumination for 6 h (Fig. 26d–g).485

Coupling bismuth halide perovskite materials with other materials to form heterojunctions can promote their photocatalytic activities. For example, a TiO2/Cs3Bi2I9 heterojunction was prepared by anchoring Cs3Bi2I9 on commercial UV100-TiO2 NPs, exhibiting excellent stability and a remarkable yield for photocatalytic oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde under visible light illumination.487 Similarly, Cs2AgBiBr6/rGO composites were applied for H2 evolution in saturated HBr aqueous solution (Fig. 26h).486 As shown in Fig. 26i, j, with the optimized loading amount of rGO, the Cs2AgBiBr6/rGO composite exhibited a high photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 489 μmol g−1 within 10 h under visible light illumination (λ ≥ 420 nm, 300 W Xe lamp). In addition, a high stability for 120 h continuous photocatalytic H2 evolution was achieved.
In addition to CO2 reduction, H2 evolution and organic dye degradation, bismuth halide perovskite materials have also been applied for photocatalytic organic synthesis. For example, Cs3Bi2Br9 NPs were anchored in the pore channels of mesoporous SBA-15 silica (Cs3Bi2Br9/SBA-15) for photocatalytic C–H bond activation.488 It was found that Cs3Bi2Br9/SBA-15 can efficiently oxidize hydrocarbons (C5 to C16 including aromatic and aliphatic alkanes) with a conversion rate up to 32900 μmol gcat−1 h−1 and excellent selectivity (>99%) towards their corresponding oxygenates such as aldehydes and ketones under visible light illumination. In addition, Cs3Bi2Br9 was also applied as a photocatalyst for epoxide alcoholysis under visible light illumination, exhibiting a significantly high activity and selectivity (≥86%) for β-alkoxy alcohols and thia-compounds.489

5. Conclusion and prospects
Semiconductor based photocatalysis that enables storing abundant solar energy in chemical bonds is one of the most promising technologies for sustainable energy production and environmental remediation. However, the practical application of photocatalysis has not been realized since its first discovery in the 1970s, due to the lack of appropriate semiconductor materials to achieve a sufficiently high solar conversion efficiency. Since visible light accounts for ∼43% of the solar spectrum, the development of visible light responsive semiconductor materials is highly desirable to promote the advancement of photocatalysis.490 Encouragingly, most of the bismuth-based semiconductor materials can absorb visible light and have been developed for photocatalysis with versatile applications including pollutant degradation, water splitting, CO2 reduction, N2 fixation, and organic synthesis. This review article focused on the state-of-the-art progress of various bismuth nanomaterials such as Bi NPs, binary bismuth compounds, ternary bismuth compounds and other bismuth related compounds reported for photocatalysis. In particular, the optoelectronic properties of each bismuth-based material are presented, and the up-dated strategies for each material system towards efficient photocatalysis have been discussed in detail. The recent progress of some key bismuth-based photocatalysts is summarized in Table 4.

Among all the reported bismuth-based materials, BiVO4 has attracted the most attention, which has been regarded as one of the most promising metal oxide photoanode materials for PEC water splitting. Significant progress of BiVO4 photoanodes has been achieved in recent years and its achieved photocurrent density is very close to its theoretical value. With careful design, an excellent stability of over 1100 h for PEC water splitting has been achieved.491 To make a new breakthrough in BiVO4, the next research direction should be the reduction of its bandgap. Considering the bandgap of 2.4 eV for BiVO4, even reducing its bandgap by 0.1 eV can significantly improve its theoretical STH efficiency from 9.2% to 11%.492 Effectively reducing the bandgap of BiVO4 while keeping the excellent photocatalytic activity remains challenging. Therefore, more studies are still necessary to deeply understand the electronic structure and charge separation of BiVO4.
Compared to BiVO4, the research progress on other bismuth-based semiconductor materials for photocatalysis is much slower, and the performances achieved hitherto are far from satisfactory. To further improve their photocatalytic activities, it is necessary to deeply understand their optoelectronic parameters such as the light absorption coefficient, charge carrier mobility, carrier diffusion length, and surface reaction kinetics. Accordingly, more efforts should be made to develop appropriate strategies for efficiently improving their photocatalytic activity. In addition, most of the bismuth-based semiconductors are applied for photocatalytic organic dye degradation. It is highly desirable to explore their applications in other more challenging reactions such as water splitting and CO2 reduction. In particular, efficient overall water splitting without any sacrificial agent and external bias is the ultimate goal for photocatalytic water splitting, which is still a challenging task.
Owing to their excellent optoelectronic properties, metal halide perovskite materials have been intensively developed for solar cells. However, the application of metal halide perovskite materials for photocatalysis is challenging because of their vulnerability in aqueous solution or even a high humidity environment. Encouragingly, all inorganic bismuth-based halide perovskite materials such as Cs3Bi2Br9 and Cs2AgBiBr6 are more stable compared to other metal halide perovskites and their applications for photocatalytic organic pollutant degradation, hydrogen production, CO2 reduction and value-added chemical synthesis have been reported. However, the long-term stability remains challenging. Thus, it is highly desirable to explore effective and reliable strategies to significantly improve the long-term stability of bismuth-based halide perovskites to fully realize their excellent optoelectronic properties for photocatalysis.
Overall, the bandgaps and band edge positions of most bismuth-based materials are promising for photocatalysis, but there are still many challenges to achieve efficient photocatalytic performances. In addition to the fundamental studies on these materials, more cutting-edge microscopy and spectroscopy technologies such as synchrotron radiation, time-resolved spectroscopy, and in situ infrared spectroscopy should be applied to deeply understand their photocatalytic mechanisms. We look forward to more exciting development of bismuth-based nanomaterials for efficient photocatalysis.
