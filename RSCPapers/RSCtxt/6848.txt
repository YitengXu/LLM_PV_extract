    , Accepted 30th September 2019First published on 1st October 2019AbstractThe development of new processing techniques with high reliability in large-scale fabrication is considered to be the most critical issue concerning organic–inorganic halide perovskite photovoltaics for their potential commercialization in the next few years. Herein, the incorporation of a Br-containing tetrabutylammonium salt (TBAB) into the perovskite precursors demonstrated superior advantages in both crystallization and large-area uniformity control during the scalable blade-coating of perovskite films. By this facile approach, the significantly increased repeatability in device performance and efficient large-area 16 cm2-four-cell modules with best-efficiency of up to 15.79% were achieved. More importantly, the surficial modification with the alkylammonium cations enabled the long-term stability of the MAPbI3-based perovskite films and modules, resulting in the fabricated modules retaining >89% of the initial PCE after 1000 h of aging. This study presents a facile method for achieving the synergistic effects of crystallization tailoring, uniformity control and surface passivation based on the Br-containing molecular modification strategy for perovskite films, leading to the significantly improved efficiency, stability and fabrication reliability of PSC modules.
Introduction
Due to their extraordinary advantages of a large absorption coefficient,1 long carrier diffusion length,2 high defect tolerance3–5 and abundant fabrication methods,6 organic–inorganic halide perovskites have gained much attention in recent ten years. The record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have also increased rapidly and the certified best-performing cell has achieved up to 25.2%,7 showing the great potential for application in next-generation low-cost and efficient photovoltaics. Currently, the development of economical, scalable and reliable depositing methods is considered to be the most critical issue in the fabrication of PSC modules towards actual commercialization. To date, a series of scalable coating techniques represented by blade-coating,8–10 slot-die,11 brush-painting,12,13 inkjet printing,14 gas blowing,15 bar coating,16,17etc., have been investigated for the fabrication of large-area perovskite modules. However, in spite of the promising progress that has been made by these methods for small-area devices, unfortunately, a large variation in film uniformity across the macro-large-area always exists and subsequently leads to a significant decline in PCE when applied to larger modules. Therefore, an effective manipulation method for crystallization tailoring and uniformity control in the scalable deposition is still required for the efficient perovskite module fabrication.
Recently, the selection of functionalized additives for doping into perovskite precursors has been demonstrated to be a facile and effective method for manipulating the processes for crystallinity, uniformity or stability of large-scale perovskites.18 By introducing surfactant additives to lower the surface tension in the solution-based fabrication process, Huang et al. demonstrated that the film uniformity can be dramatically increased during the blade-coating process for large-scale perovskite films.8 By introducing additional Cl−-containing salt or hydrochloride into I−-based organic halide perovskites, the competition between halide anions has been well demonstrated to be an effective way to manipulate the crystallization process.19–22 For stability improvement, a series of molecular capping or encapsulation strategies have been reported in recent work via the passivation of the perovskite surfaces, such as using alkyl ammonium,23–27 neutral amines,28 porphyrins,29,30 fullerenes,31 or other materials.18,32 Therefore, searching for a multi-functional doping additive to simultaneously realize these aims is still an attractive and important route for the low-cost, high-quality and scalable fabrication of perovskite films.
Tetra-alkylammonium salts with halide anions, surfactant characteristics and alkyl ammonium render them as promising multifunctional additive candidates in perovskite films to resolve these issues synergistically. Thus, we developed a new strategy for doping a Br-containing surfactant additive (tetrabutylammonium bromide, TBAB) into perovskite precursors to simultaneously alter the solution flow dynamics, manipulate the crystallization process and passivate the surface during the blade-coating based large-scale perovskite film fabrication (Fig. 1). The results indicate that the surfactant characteristics of TBAB with amphiphilic properties decreased the surface tension to promote the uniform film formation during the solution based blade-coating process, while the Br anions synergistically prolonged and improved the crystallization process by competing with I−, as did Cl−, which has been well verified in previous work.21 Moreover, as expected, the alkylammonium cations of TBA+ finally terminated the surface and grain boundaries of perovskites, which passivated the surface defects of the as-fabricated perovskite films, leading to the dramatically increased moisture stability of the as-fabricated devices. Subsequently, the significantly improved film quality and uniformity produced an efficient and stable perovskite module (16 cm2): the PCE achieved over 15% and maintained >89% of its initial PCE for over 1000 h.

Results and discussion
Herein, the large-scale perovskite layer of MAPbI3 was deposited using the blade-coating process12 combined with the post-vacuum-flash treatment,33 followed by the thermal annealing treatment (Fig. 1a). By using the proposed doping strategy, an obvious mirror-like morphology was observed on the large-scale perovskite film (36 cm2) by using the optimized doping of the TBAB additive (0.1 g L−1) as compared to the control, indicating the much smoother surface and uniformity of the film quality, as shown in Fig. 2a. The surface profile measurement indicated that the TBAB-doped film has a significantly decreased roughness (RMS = 8.6 nm) over a macroscopic distance (1 mm) as compared to the value of 35.8 nm for the control film without TBAB (Fig. S1†). The absorption spectra measured in five different regions across the substrate (36 cm2) showed almost no difference, indicating the high uniformity in thickness (Fig. S2†). Further XRD characterization (Fig. 2b) demonstrated that the crystallinity of the perovskite films was also significantly increased after using the TBAB as the additive to manipulate the crystallization process, where the intensity was improved by more than 2-times for the dominant MAPbI3 (110) and (220) diffractions. Additionally, the resolvable weak PbI2 (001) peak located at 12.7° with the same order of intensity for the films indicated that the doped TBAB has a negligible impact on the formation of PbI2, which might be generated from the rare degradation of MAPbI3 during the post-annealing in open air.

(d) Current–voltage (J–V) curves of the best performing module with the size of 16 cm2 measured from reverse and forward scan under AM 1.5G conditions (100 mW cm−2). The active area of the module was estimated to be ∼8.0 cm2. (e) Long-term stability comparison of the modules based on the perovskite films tailored by TBAB (or not). 
We used this pinhole-free film with high uniformity and crystallinity to fabricate the perovskite modules using the Au/Spiro-MeOTAD/perovskite/mesoporous TiO2/ZnO–ZnS/FTO device architecture (Fig. 2c) and the designed module parameters (Fig. S3†). The current–voltage (J–V) measurement showed that compared with the control films without the TBAB additive with the champion module efficiency of 7.01% (Fig. S4†), an efficient photovoltaic (PV) performance with PCE up to 15.79% (reverse scan: Voc of 3.98 V, Jsc of 5.82 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.68) was facilely achieved on the TBAB tailored perovskite films (Fig. 2d). It also showed high reproducibility with the average PCE of 14.75 ± 0.29% for ten modules (Fig. S5†). A remarkable air stability toward moisture were also unprecedentedly achieved for the TBAB doped module, which retained over 89% of its initial efficiency after 1000 h with a humidity of about 45% at room temperature (∼25 °C), compared with the rapid decline to <30% after aging for 480 hours on the control device. This PV performance improvement of the module certainly benefited from the highly improved film uniformity and crystal quality.
Due to the selection of alkyl ammonium with surfactant properties for TBAB, the lower surface tension was considered to be the main reason for the uniformity improvement.8 The surface-wetting property test indicated that a much smaller contact angle (26.5° vs. 16.6°) was obtained when the TBAB-doped precursor was deposited on the substrates (Fig. S6†). As proposed, the competition between I− and doped Br− anions to coordinate with Pb2+ in the organic–inorganic halide perovskites should be the main reason for crystallinity improvement.21 In this case, the crystallization is retarded during the post-vacuum-flash and annealing processes,34 which is similar to that reported when using the Cl− containing additives.20,35,36 Subsequently, the nucleation density of perovskites is dramatically decreased and results in the obviously increased grain sizes and crystallinity. The SEM images shown in Fig. 3a and b reveal the significantly enlarged perovskite grains on the TBAB doped film, which are consistent with the XRD characterizations, showing the much higher crystallinity of the perovskite film. The obtained films also appear to be much different from the recently reported ones tailored by neutral amine additive, which involves using the coordination effect from the additives.28 For comparison, the typical neutral amine of 1,3-diaminopropane (DAP) was adopted to prepare the perovskite films using the same procedures of this work, as shown in Fig. S7.† Other characterizations of the blade-coated PbI2 films (Fig. S8†) also demonstrated that the doped TBAB has small interactions with Pb2+, which excludes the tailoring mechanism of TBAB originating from the generally used coordination effect.28,37

(d)–(f) Comparison of the absorption, steady-state PL, time-resolved PL and SCLC curves for the perovskite films with and without TBAB doping. The device configuration for the I–V measurement for the SCLC analysis is shown in (f). 
To directly reveal the effect of halide anion competition between I− and Br− on the crystallization process, in situ transmittance was performed to monitor the film-formation of the blade-coated films during the post vacuum flash process. Here, a green laser (532 nm) was used as the light source and an optical power meter was adopted to record the time-related transmission light intensity. The normalized transmittance is shown in Fig. 3c. An obviously extended colour evolution process was observed on the TBAB-doped perovskite film, indicating the remarkably retarded crystallization kinetics. Obviously, the excess Br− anions from TBAB prevented the fast nucleation and growth of perovskite grains, leading to the prolonged conversion of the precursor to the PbI6 perovskite structure during the film formation. Thus, larger perovskite grains with higher crystallinity were obtained for the TBAB tailored films as discussed above. As a consequence, the increased crystal quality produced much better optical and electrical properties for the MAPbI3 perovskite films. It was found that much higher absorbance and sharper absorption edges were achieved on the TBAB-doped film with simultaneously enhanced photoluminescence (PL) (Fig. 3d), indicating the largely decreased non-radiative recombination in the perovskite layer. Time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra were also obtained to evaluate the carrier's lifetime and recombination rate in the films, as shown in Fig. 3e. The curves were well fitted using bi-exponential functions, and the fitting results are statistically shown in Table 1. It can be seen that the carrier lifetime for the slow decaying component (τ2), which represents the recombination within the inner perovskite grains,38 was obviously increased from 953.5 ns to 1150.0 ns after introducing the TBAB additive; this indicates that the recombination defects in the inner perovskite grains were obviously reduced. For the fast component (τ1), which represents the surface recombination process, the lifetime was significantly increased from 42.1 ns to 509.8 ns, demonstrating that the surface defects were effectively passivated by the TBAB additive. The results matched well with the calculated defect density by the SCLC method (Fig. 3f) when using the equation VTFL = qNtrapd2/2εε0,38 where the defect density was decreased approximately 4-fold from 1.57 × 1016 cm−3 to 3.95 × 1015 cm−3 in the TBAB doped film; here, q is the electronic charge, d is the thickness of the perovskite film, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, and ε is the static dielectric constant of MAPbI3 (∼70).39 The trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL), which represents the trap states being completely filled at this voltage,40 was measured to be 0.12 V and 0.41 V for the device tailored by TBAB, or not, respectively.

The strongly increased crystal quality, film uniformity and suppressed non-radiative recombination within these trap defects resulted in the significantly improved PV performance of the modules. We also fabricated a conventional small area device (0.12 cm2) to evaluate the PV performance and air stability on a single device. There was significant improvement in the average efficiencies (Fig. 4) of the TBAB tailored films, which also demonstrated extremely high reproducibility. As shown in the J–V curves of Fig. 4a, the best-performing device achieved 19.34%-PCE, yielding Voc of 1.07 V, Jsc of 23.24 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.78, as compared with PCE of 16.15%, Voc of 1.01 V, Jsc of 21.82 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.73. A remarkable average PCE improvement by ∼46% (from 12.54% to 18.28%) was accomplished in the devices employing the TBAB tailored films, with a significant decrease in the standard deviation (SD) from 1.91 to 0.37. The estimated Jsc from the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum (Fig. S9†) for the best-performing cells with and without TBAB additive in Fig. 4a was 22.45 and 20.87 mA cm−2, respectively, which matched well with the obtained values in the J–V measurement. Obviously, the significantly improved crystal quality, film uniformity and electrical properties contributed to the improvements in the PV performance and device reproducibility. Based on this high reproducibility on small area perovskite films, efficient module performance was also predictably achieved. Additionally, as shown in Fig. 4c, the fabricated devices based on the TBAB-doped film also presented a stable power output under the AM 1.5 light illumination. When compared with the control device, almost no decay was resolved in the measurement for the TBAB tailored device, while a continuous decline in the current density and unstable output was found in the control sample. The quite stable power output demonstrates the highly improved air-stability of the TBAB tailored perovskite films and the results matched well with the long-term stability of the perovskite modules shown in Fig. 2e.

(c) Stabilized current output of the corresponding devices for comparison. The measurements were taken in ambient air without device sealing and under AM 1.5G light irradiation (100 mW cm−2). A bias voltage at the corresponding maximum power point (MPP) was used (0.82 V and 0.90 V for the devices without and with TBAB, respectively) in the measurements. 
Since small molecules containing alkyl-ammonium cations have been widely used as surface modifiers to passivate the surface and enhance the moisture stability of perovskite films in previous reports,23,25,41,42 the surface passivation effect of TBA+ was considered to be another main reason for the improvement in stability, besides the significantly improved crystal quality and uniformity. To further explore the effect of TBAB on the air stability of perovskite films and devices, we measured the cross-sectional element distribution of Br within the perovskite films using EDX mapping with comparison to I and Pb (Fig. 5a). The results clearly indicate that Br element was mostly located on the surfaces and boundaries of the perovskite grains. In spite of the halide anion competition in the film-forming process, the presence of reactive I− still ensured that no Br− was incorporated into the final perovskite crystal structure.21 The absence of a blue-shift in the PL spectra of Fig. 3d also implied that the doped Br was not incorporated into the perovskite crystal lattice. However, it should be noted that Br did not evaporate, as did Cl when using the Cl related additives such as MACl.43 This is because TBAB (TBA+ units and Br− anions) was effectively anchored onto the surfaces and boundaries of perovskite grains by passivating the surface defects, generally the ion vacancies, which is similar to other alkylammonium salts, such as PEAI, demonstrated in previous work.26,44 Thus, perfect surface encapsulation was achieved on the TBAB tailored film. As demonstrated in recent experimental and theoretical work,23 the reduced surface energy by this passivation is the main mechanism for improving the stability when the alkyl ligand binds to the surface of perovskites.

(f) The surface potential values on the typical line-scan marked in (d) and (e). (g) Contact angle measurement for the perovskite films with and without TBAB for a comparison. 
This uniform surface passivation by the alkyl ligands can also be intuitively viewed by the surface contact potential differences (CPD) in the prepared perovskite films, which were measured by scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM). The results indicated that the doped TBAB not only facilitates a much smoother surface with lower roughness (RMS = 11.9 nm) as compared to that of the control sample (16.7 nm) as shown in the topography images in Fig. 5b and c, but it also produced a highly uniform, enhanced surface potential (SP) as shown in Fig. 5d and e. The average SP value calculated from the typical line-scan (Fig. 5f) for the TBAB tailored films was 143 ± 33 mV, while a much lower SP value of 101 ± 53 mV was obtained on the control film. Obviously, the much higher and more uniform SP distribution for the TBAB tailored film originated from the uniform surface decoration of tetrabutylammonium groups. This surface decoration by alkyl ligands also produced decreased wettability, which was visually seen from the decreasing of the contact angle from 60° to 44°, as shown in Fig. 5g. Certainly, the reduction of the surface free energy of substrates by the alkyl groups on TBAB was the main reason, and this feature would be further beneficial for moisture resistance.25,31
To directly evaluate the moisture stability, we monitored the film decomposition process in a high humidity (RH) environment at ∼85% RH and room temperature. The color evolution of the perovskite films without and with TBAB doping clearly confirmed the moisture stability (Fig. S10†), where the film remained black for the TBAB-doped film while most of the control film changed to yellow due to almost complete decomposition after about two days. The above results verified that the surface modification by TBAB effectively inhibited the entrance of moisture and suppressed the escape of organic cations within the perovskite film, thus enhancing the air stability.
In this work, the optimized amount of TBAB additive that realized the best PV performance on the devices was about 0.1 g L−1 (Fig. S11†). Further increase in additive doping would result in decreased charge transport performance, possibly caused by the excess organic groups within the interface of the device, as demonstrated by the EIS measurement shown in Fig. S12.† We have also evaluated two other ionic surfactant additives, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBAC), for a comparison. The results show that all three kinds of additives could well increase the surface uniformity as compared with the control film without additive (Fig. S13†). However, in contrast to the TBAB, due to the absence of the halide competition effect, no crystallization manipulation feature was found on the SDS-doped perovskite films, as seen in the SEM images and XRD characterization (Fig. 6a and d). For the TBAC-doped film, in spite of the slightly increased grain size that was observed in the films due to the halide competition between Cl− and I− (Fig. 6b), the crystallinity was not obviously enhanced. The typical J–V curves (Fig. 6e) and summarized photovoltaic performance (Table 2) also demonstrated that the TBAB was the most effective doping additive.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a Br-containing alkyl ammonium salt (TBAB) doping strategy for manipulating the film formation during the scalable blade-coating of perovskite films, which synergistically improved the crystalline uniformity and moisture resistance, yielding an efficient PV module performance with PCE over 15.0% and considerable stability over 1000 h with <15% efficiency loss. Regular small-area devices also achieved efficiencies >19% with high reproducibility (average PCE of 18.25 ± 0.37%). The experimental results verified that the simultaneous enhancement of efficiency and stability originated from the following. (i) The surfactant feature of TBAB lowered the surface tension of the precursor and promoted the uniform film-formation on the substrate. (ii) The halide anion competition between I− and Br− retarded the crystallization and improved the perovskite crystallinity. (iii) The surface modification by tetrabutylammonium not only inhibited the moisture attack but also suppressed the escape of organic cations within perovskites. The mechanism studies in this work revealed that the Br− containing tetrabutylammonium salt can be facilely used in various solution-based scalable fabrications for the improvement of the efficiency and stability via the manipulation of crystallization dynamics and surface passivation.
Experimental
Blade coating of perovskite films
Laser patterned square FTO glasses (NSG, Tec-7, 7 Ω per square) with sizes of 4 cm2, 16 cm2, and 36 cm2, were ultrasonically cleaned with detergent, acetone and ethanol for 30 min in sequence. After drying, a compact ZnO/ZnS layer of about 30 nm-thick was spray-coated at 450 °C using the precursor developed in our previous work.45 A mesoporous TiO2 layer was then deposited onto the substrates by spin-coating with a slurry of TiO2 and isopropanol (1:7, mass ratio) at 5000 rpm for 30 s. Afterwards, the substrates were dried at 80 °C for 5 min and annealed at 500 °C for 30 min in air. For the perovskite precursor solution, 461 mg of PbI2, 159 mg of MAI and 16 mg MACl were dissolved in the mixture of 100 μL NMP and 400 μL DMF with or without TBAB additive (0.1 g L−1). To fabricate the perovskite films, a drop of (typically 4 μL for 4 × 4 cm2 substrate and 6 μL for 6 × 6 cm2) perovskite precursor was dripped into the gap (∼200 μm) between the blade and substrate, followed by the automatic movement at a speed of ∼2 mm s−1. The wet films were then transferred into a homemade vacuum chamber to undergo the vacuum-flash process, which involved pumping to ∼102 Pa from atmospheric pressure within 20 s, and maintaining that pressure for 2 min. During the vacuum-flash process, the substrate gradually changed colour to brown and was then transferred to a hotplate for annealing for 10 min at 120 °C. All of the processes mentioned above were carried out in ambient air with humidity of ∼40% (RH).
Device fabrication
After the deposition of the perovskite layer, the hole transporting material (HTM) layer was spin-coated onto the film at 4000 rpm for 30 s using Spiro-MeOTAD (72.3 mg, Lumtech) in chlorobenzene (1 mL) with additives of 4-tert-butylpyridine (28.8 μL) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TSFI) solution (17.5 μL, 520 mg Li-TSFI in 1 mL acetonitrile, Alfa Aesar). Finally, 60 nm-thick gold electrodes were evaporated under vacuum at 2 × 10−7 torr to configure the devices with an active area of 0.12 cm2. To fabricate perovskite solar modules, the FTO electrode, compact ZnO–ZnS/mesoporous TiO2/perovskite/Spiro-MeOTAD, and Au electrode were sequentially laser scribed to form a P1–P2–P3 pattern as shown in Fig. S3.†
Device characterization
The surface/cross-sectional morphology and EDX mapping of the perovskite films or devices were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) (S-4800, Hitachi). The UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a spectrophotometer (UV-2550, Shimadzu). The crystallinity of the perovskite films was evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Ultima IV, Rigaku) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154178 nm) within a 2θ range of 5–55°. The J–V curves were measured using a source meter (2400, Keithley) under irradiation of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G illumination) provided by a xenon-based solar simulator (94022A, Newport, Class ABA), which was calibrated by a standard Si reference cell (91150V) with the certification of the NREL. The IPCE spectra were measured using a QE/IPCE Measurement Kit equipped with a power source (66920, Newport, 300 W xenon lamp), a monochromator (Cornerstone 260, Newport) and an optical power meter (2936-R, Newport). The steady and time-resolved PL spectra were measured using an FLS980 (Edinburgh) fluorescence spectrometer excited by a 377.6 nm pulsed laser. The stabilized power output for the PSC devices was measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under AM 1.5 simulated solar irradiation and a bias at the corresponding maximum power point (MPP) for the device.
