    , Accepted 20th November 2021First published on 23rd November 2021AbstractPorous organic polymers (POPs) are organic macromolecules that are considered emerging materials because of their high specific surface areas, tunable porosities, low densities, high chemical and thermal stabilities, variable compositions, convenient post-functionalization, extended π-conjugations, and their high contents of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and other non-metallic atoms. POPs have been classified into four types: covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs), hypercrosslinked polymers (HCPs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs). These materials have potential applications in, for example, gas capture/separation, energy storage, H2 production from water, photocatalysis, chemical sensing, perovskite solar cells, water treatment, optical devices, and biomedicine. In this review, we provide an overview of recent reports describing the preparation and various applications of POPs.
1. Introduction
Porous structures have existed in nature for a very long time in, for example, charcoal, biological tissues, and rocks.1 The word “porous” is usually used to describe a material featuring interconnected permanent voids that allow the passage of gases or liquids.1 Porous materials are applied in many technological and scientific fields, with a huge number of new advanced porous materials having been developed during the last two decades.2–14 Based on the IUPAC classification, porous materials can be divided, based on their pore diameters, into microporous (<2 nm), mesoporous (>2 nm and <50 nm), and macroporous (>50 nm) materials.15–22 Various porous materials have been constructed from metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and porous organic polymers (POPs).1,23–28 MOFs are typically crystalline porous materials or porous coordination polymers obtained through the formation of coordinate bonds between organic ligands and clusters or metal ions to form voids within the framework structure, thereby resulting in porosity.23–25 In the past two decades, many groups have prepared various subclasses of POP frameworks, including porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs), covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs), polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs), hypercrosslinked polymers (HCPs), and conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) (Fig. 1).1,29–33 The preparation of each kind of POP generally occurs through network reactions.1 All POPs are amorphous materials—except for a small number of CTFs and COFs that are crystalline materials with ordered structures prepared under thermodynamic control.1 Like nanoporous materials, POPs have many potential applications because of their high surface areas and uniform pore sizes, with large numbers of channels and active sites available for chemical reactions.3,34–37 Accordingly, POPs have attracted attention for their use in, for example, the degradation of organic pollutants, energy storage, photocatalysis, H2 evolution, light harvesting, photovoltaics, luminescence, gas adsorption and separation, chemical sensing, and drug loading and delivery.38–54 Various morphologies of POPs, including nanotubes, nanospheres, and nanosheets, can be controlled by varying the synthetic method, the monomer structure, or the reaction conditions.45,48,55 Furthermore, the surface areas of POPs, typically in the range 100–1000 m2 g−1, are higher than those of MOFs and porous carbons.3 In 2007, Yaghi et al. prepared a 3D-COF-103 possessing a high Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of 4210 m2 g−1.56 Ben et al. used the Yamamoto reaction to prepare a PAF (PAF-1) exhibiting a high specific area (4210 m2 g−1).57 The insolubility of POPs in organic solvents, due to their rigid chemical bonds and high degrees of polymerization, can simplify the separation and recycling of POPs.3 In this review, we provide an overview of recent reports describing the preparation of POPs (including CTFs, COFs, HCPs, and CMPs) and their applications in photocatalytic water splitting for H2 evolution, gas capture and separation, chemosensing, the removal of dyes and metals, organic synthesis, and energy storage.

2. Preparation of POPs
In this section, we discuss progress in the synthetic methodologies that are widely used for the preparation four kinds of POPs: HCPs, CTFs, CMPs, and COFs.
2.1. Preparation of HCPs
HCPs are porous polymers that have attracted much attention for their extended conjugation; tunable porosities; high surface areas; high mechanical, chemical, and hydrothermal stabilities; variety of potential synthetic methods; and facile post-functionalization after HCP formation.58–63 Many methods have been used to determine the chemical structures, thermal stabilities, morphologies, and textural characteristics (e.g., pore size diameters and surface areas) of HCPs, including Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, elemental analysis, solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), optical microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM), N2 adsorption isotherms, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).58–63 Davankov and Tsyurupa were the first to generate three-dimensional (3D) network structures of linear polystyrene (PS) with high surface areas (up to 2000 m2 g−1) as the first HCP material, through post-crosslinking of a PS precursor in the swollen state.64 The formation HCPs can be achieved through acid-catalyzed Friedel–Crafts reactions involving a Lewis acid catalyst, a reaction solvent, and arene-based nucleophilic and electrophilic species.65 To avoid products forming through side reactions during the knitting step, the reactions are performed under Ar and N2 atmospheres to afford pure HCPs as solid materials.65 The incorporation of metal species into HCPs can be performed through post-modification—by introducing a metal salt or complex—or by using a metal complex as a co-monomer or monomer during the knitting reaction (Fig. 2).65 HCP materials have been employed in many applications, including energy storage; (supercapacitor devices, and lithium, sodium, and potassium batteries); chemical sensing; heterogeneous catalysis; optoelectronic devices; drug delivery; gas capture and separation; and chromatographic separation.58–65

2.2. Preparation of CTFs
CTFs are partially crystalline, amorphous porous materials possessing conjugated and layered structures.66 Thomas and co-workers were the first to report examples of CTF materials containing aromatic rings and triazine moieties in the core.6 CTFs have attracted much attention for their potential applications in, for example, CO2 reduction, pollutant degradation, organosynthesis, water splitting, H2O2 and H2 production, and organic semiconductor devices.67–72 Several approaches have been used for the preparation of CTFs, including cyclotrimerization of nitrile groups through direct or indirect methods in the presence of molten ZnCl2 at 400 °C; superacid-catalyzed trimerization; Suzuki cross-coupling; Ni-catalyzed Yamamoto coupling; and P2O5 catalysis at 400 °C (Fig. 3).66 The preparation of CTFs with highly crystalline structures requires the selection of monomers with planar characteristics; the use of nonplanar monomers leads to the formation amorphous or semicrystalline CTFs.73–76 To date, only a few crystalline CTFs have been reported. For example, Tang et al. found that the degree of crystallinity of CTFs and the formation of uniform layered structures increased upon increasing the microwave power from 20 to 100 W.77 Interestingly, Xu et al. prepared a two-dimensional (2D) CTF with a well stacked structure within 10 min at 25 °C through a TfOH-catalyzed interfacial reaction, with simple purification procedures applied after the trimerization reactions (Fig. 4).78 They found that the crystalline CTFs formed using this approach were AB-staggered; in contrast, mostly crystalline CTFs exhibiting the AA stacking mode were obtained when using the ionothermal method.

2.3. Preparation of CMPs
CMPs are microporous organic polymers that are emerging materials because of their permanent building blocks; huge surface areas; structural adjustability, diversity, and modularity; expanded degrees of conjugation; and excellent physiochemical stabilities.79–82 Accordingly, CMPs have been used widely as materials for photovoltaic devices, light-harvesting, photocatalysis, adsorbents, luminescent materials, and clean energy applications (e.g., supercapacitors, H2 storage, photocatalytic cells, metal–ion rechargeable batteries, CO2 capture and conversion, and fuel cells).79–82 The interesting properties of CMPs arise from (i) their expanded conjugated structures along the polymer chains (significantly enhancing their chemical and physiochemical stabilities) and (ii) their high surface areas and highly crosslinked polymeric network structures (improving their electrochemical activities, cycle stabilities, and kinetics and preventing the active material from dissolution into organic electrolytes).79–84 The approaches used most widely for the preparation of CMPs include phenazine ring fusion, electropolymerization, alkyne metathesis, Schiff base formation, and Yamamoto, Heck, Sonogashira–Hagihara, Buchwald–Hartwig, and Suzuki–Miyaura cross-couplings. These methods allow good selectivities, a range of different of substrates, suitable reaction conditions, simple post-synthetic modifications, and the high-yield production of CMPs with high specific surface areas.
2.4. Preparation of COFs
COFs are important emerging materials with potential applications in a wide range of fields, including optics, gas capture, lithium–sulfur batteries, electrocatalysis, metal adsorption, light harvesting, and sensing; they are easy to prepare with high surface areas and total pore volumes, moderate physical and chemical properties, and homogeneous micropores.85–92 COFs have been formed with 2D and 3D network structures comprising backbones containing carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms as well as other elements, including oxygen (O), boron (B), sulfur (S), and nitrogen (N) atoms. Various topologies of 2D and 3D COFs can be induced by varying the geometries and dimensions of their building blocks (Fig. 5).93 Compared with other porous polymeric materials, the ability to predict the skeleton structures of COFs is unique. The many synthetic techniques available for the preparation of COFs include sonochemical methods, interfacial synthesis, ionothermal synthesis, mechanochemical methods, microwave-assisted synthesis, and solvothermal synthesis.93 The fabrication of COF skeletons with particular pore sizes and symmetries depends on the choice of suitable linkers and organic building blocks. The types of linkers that have been used for the preparation of COFs include hydrazone, phenazine, imine, azine, boroxine, imide, and triazine units (Fig. 6).93 2D COF frameworks can have nine different topologies: hexagonal layer (hxl), kgd, tth, mtf, bex, kagome (kgm), hexagonal tungsten bronze (htb), square lattice (sql), and hcb (Fig. 7).94 Feng and co-workers prepared a 3D anionic CDCOF (rra net) containing trinodal secondary building units through the condensation reaction of γ-CD with B(OMe)3 in the presence of LiOH under microwave conditions.95 In addition, Yaghi et al. obtained a COF-based tth topology when combining square-planar, hexagonal, and triangular building blocks and observed tth topology tiling.96

3. Potential applications of POPs
3.1. CO2 capture
POPs are ideal candidates for capturing CO2 gas in a green and environmentally friendly manner. Very recently, the Tan group prepared two novel inorganic–organic crosslinked polymers (HCP-PN-1, and HCP-PN-2) based on phosphazene moieties through Friedel–Crafts alkylations for the nucleophilic substitution of hexachlorotriphosphazene with 2-naphthol (PN-Nap-1 and PN-Nap-2) to give nitrogen- and phosphorus-enriched HCPs (Fig. 8).97 Interestingly, these HCPs had hierarchical pore structures and high surface areas (based on BET measurements) that led to high degrees of CO2 adsorption (HCP-PN-1: 72 mg g−1; HCP-PN-2: 57 mg g−1; at 273 K). Li et al. prepared MOP-PZ containing NC and NH groups through a Scholl reaction of 3,5-diphenyl-1H-pyrazole in the presence of AlCl3 in CHCl3 as the solvent. They prepared the hybrid material MOP-PZ-Ag by embedding silver nanoparticles (NPs) into MOP-PZ, and found that MOP-PZ-Ag functioned as a heterogeneous catalyst for the production of propiolic acid through the carboxylation of some terminal alkynes; this stable hybrid material also displayed an excellent degree of CO2 adsorption (183.7 mg g−1).98 Wang and co-workers prepared nitrogen-enriched microporous polymers containing various contents of amino groups through condensation reactions of melamine with formohydrazide, formamide, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and N-methylformamide. These four polymers possessed pore diameters of 0.52–1.10 nm and specific surface areas of 612–748 m2 g−1, with the BET method, and SEM, and TEM analysis revealing that they were agglomerates of tiny particles with an irregular shape and porous structures; the four polymers provided CO2 uptakes of up to 103 mg g−1 at 273 K.99 Liang et al. prepared four kinds of CMPs and used a post-knitting approach to improve their porosities, affording eight CMP-based HCPs (KCMPs) (Fig. 9).100 These KCMPs had high specific surface areas (up to 2267 m2 g−1), high pore volumes (up to 3.27 cm3 g−1), and excellent degrees of CO2 uptake (up to 175.12 mg g−1 at 273 K). Das et al. prepared two kinds of CTFs based on 1,2,3-triazolo units; their Tz-CTF polymeric frameworks exhibited excellent CO2 uptake capacities, with a high surface area, chemical and thermal stabilities, agglomerated tiny particles, and regular porous structures, based on SEM and TEM imaging.101 Our group also prepared two bicarbazole-based COFs (Cz-BD, and Cz-DHBD) through Schiff-base condensations of Cz-4CHO (as the C2-symmetric knot) with BD and DHBD.102 These Cz-BD and Cz-DHBD COFs possessed high surface areas (up to 2111 and 992.2 m2 g−1, respectively) as well as thermal stability up to 507 °C. The Cz-DHBD COF featured a kagome structure, due to intramolecular OH⋯N hydrogen bonding, that increased the steric bulk hinderance and decreased the nucleophilicity of the imino nitrogen atoms, thereby decreasing its ability to capture CO2 (110.59 mg g−1) relative to that of the Cz-BD COF (125.95 mg g−1). In addition, we have prepared hollow microspherical and microtubular carbazole-based COFs through condensations of Car-3NH2 and the triformyl linkers TPA-3CHO, TPP-3CHO, and TPT-3CHO with various degrees of planarity, obtaining high surface areas of 1334, 743, and 721 m2 g−1, respectively. Due to their high surface areas, these Car-TPA, Car-TPT, and Car-TPP COFs provided high degrees of CO2 capture, with recorded uptake rates of up to 61, 42, and 34 mg g−1, respectively, at 298 K. Although Car-TPT and Car-TPP had similar surface areas, the former provided a higher CO2 capture rate because of the higher nitrogen content of the triazine units in the Car-TPT COF.103 The effect of the nitrogen content on the CO2 capture ability of COFs was also observed in six 2D COFs displaying various planarities, symmetries, and nitrogen contents, synthesized through the condensation reaction of TPA-3NH2 and TPT-3NH2 (as triarylamine monomers) with the monomers TPA-3CHO, TPP-3CHO, and 2TPT-3CHO (with various degrees of planarity) (Fig. 10).104 Here, TPT-3NH2 is more planar than TPA-3NH2, and TPT-3CHO is more planar than TPP-3CHO and TPA-3CHO. The COFs with lower planarity possessed lower surface areas; those with higher nitrogen contents and higher nucleophilicities displayed higher degrees of CO2 capture. As expected, the higher nitrogen contents in the TPT-based COFs provided higher rates of CO2 capture (up to 92.38 mg g−1 at 273 K for TPT-COF-6), with the greater planarity of their building blocks also enhancing the morphology to favor CO2 capture.104 We have also prepared β-ketoenamine-linked COFs (TFP-TPA, TFP-Car, and TFP-TPP) through solvothermal Schiff-base [3+3] polycondensations of TFP-3OHCHO with three tris(aminophenyl)-presenting derivatives (possessing amino, carbazole, and pyridine units, respectively).105 The TFP-TPA, TFP-Car, and TFP-TPP COFs possessed different degrees of planarity and surface areas of 457, 362, and 686 m2 g−1, respectively. The higher degrees of planarity of the TFP-Car and TFP-TPP COFs resulted in higher thermal stabilities and stronger interactions with CO2 molecules at 273 K (up to 190 and 200 mg g−1, respectively) relative to those exhibited by the lower-planarity TPA-Car COF (183 mg g−1).105 Nagai et al. reported four types of PI-COF prepared through solvothermal reactions of TAPA and TAPB with PMDA and NTCDA (Fig. 11).106 These PI-COF materials had specific surface areas exceeding 500 m2 g−1 and were applied for CO2 uptake. We have used Schiff base formation, reduction, and Mannich and Sonogashira–Hagihara couplings to prepare two new CMPs (TPE-TPE-BZ, and Py-TPE-BZ) featuring benzoxazine-linked tetraphenylethylene and pyrene units (Fig. 12)107 Upon thermal treatment, the benzoxazine units in the backbones of the TPE-TPE-BZ and Py-TPE-BZ CMPs underwent ring opening polymerizations to form new materials displaying high performance for CO2 uptake, due to the presence of phenolic OH and Mannich bridges capable of hydrogen bonding with CO2 molecules.

3.2. Dyes and iodine adsorption
Yu et al. prepared four HCP materials (BCB, Py, CCBCB, and CCPy-CMP) based on perylene, bicarbazole, and triazine units (Fig. 13).108 According to BET analyses, the surface areas of BCB, Py, CCBCB and CCPy-CMP were 545, 624, 220, and 20 m2 g−1, respectively; their surface morphologies featured nanotubes, graphitic flakes, aggregated particles, and nanosheet stacks, respectively. The I2 uptake of the CCBCP-CMP sample [11.56 wt (m−2 g−1)] was higher than those of the other precursors because of its high surface area and high content of N-heteroatoms. Recently, we used Friedel–Crafts polymerization to prepare the hybrid inorganic/organic porous materials POSS-TPE and POSS-TPP based on cubic octavinylsilsesquioxane (OVS) and tetraphenylethene and tetraphenylpyrazine units, respectively. The as-prepared POSS-TPE had a high surface area (741 m2 g−1) and good thermal stability, as determined using N2 adsorption/desorption and TGA, respectively.109 The Alameddine group prepared five CMP materials through Cu-catalyzed [4+2] benzannulations of 2,5-bis(phenylethynyl)tetraphthaldehyde with a series of 1,4-diarylethynyltriptycene derivatives.110 The resultant CMPs 1–5 were microporous, with high BET surface areas (794 m2 g−1) and pore volumes (0.63 cm−3 g−1), and displayed good I2 uptake (166 wt%). Lin et al. constructed CTT-POP1, a POP containing triaryl triazine and featuring intramolecular hydrogen bonds, that functioned as an adsorbent for the dye methylene blue because of its surface wettability and capability for π–π interactions.111 The Das group prepared a series of covalent organic polymers (COPs) through the reactions of triptycene with derivatives of benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxaldehyde.112 Interestingly, the surface areas of these resulting polymers were strongly affected by the number of OH groups in the I-COPs, as predicted from the BET profiles. Due to their high surface areas and uniform spherical shapes, determined from SEM images, the I2 capacities of these I-COPs were outstanding (ca. 4860 mg g−1) when compared with those of other COP materials. The ability to tune the charge density of COFs, when combined with their high crystallinities and high surface areas, makes them good candidates for capturing various chemicals, including dyes. Our group employed the previously mentioned BFTB-PyTA, BFTB-BFTB, and BFTB-BCTA COFs for dye adsorption; the adsorption efficacies of the hollow-structured BFTB-PyTA and BFTB-BFTB COFs were higher than that of the non-hollow-structured BFTB-BCTA COF. These COFs displayed excellent adsorption performance (up to 99.2%) and confirmed that the controlling parameters of dye adsorption in the COFs were the surface area, the morphology, and the capability for π-stacking with the dye.113

3.3. Energy storage
There are many reports of the use of POPs as excellent materials for energy storage. For example, we have prepared microporous CTFs based on pyrene units (Pyrene-CTF-10, and Pyrene-CTF-20) through ionothermal reactions of 1,3,6,8-cyanopyrene (TCNPy) with different mole ratios of ZnCl2 at 500 °C.114 Pyrene-CTF-10 and Pyrene-CTF-20 possessed high surface areas (819 and 1019 m2 g−1, respectively) and capacitances (380 and 500 F g−1, respectively). We have also prepared bicarbazole-based CTFs (Car-CTFs) based on Car-4CN. According to TGA and N2 adsorption/desorption analyses, our Car-CTFs had high specific surface areas (up to 1400 m2 g−1), and excellent coulombic efficiencies.115 Mohamed et al. synthesized two HCPs (TPE-CPOP1, and TPE-CPOP2) based on tetraphenylethene as the main building unit and these obtained materials had high BET surface areas, amorphous structures, and high specific capacitances.116 Furthermore, we prepared An-CPOP1 and An-CPOP2 through simple Friedel–Crafts alkylations of An-4Ph with 2,4,6-trichloro-1,3,5-triazine and formaldehyde dimethyl acetal as crosslinker reagents.117 An-CPOP1 possessed a tubular nanotube structure, based on SEM imaging, while An-CPOP2 displayed a capacitance of 98.10 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. Mohamed et al. prepared DPT-HPP through a Friedel–Crafts reaction of (4-(5,6-diphenyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)triphenylamine in the presence of FeCl3; it exhibited a specific capacitance of 110 F g−1 and excellent cycling stability over 2000 cycles.118 We reported the TPPDATPPyr and TPPDA-TPTPE COFs prepared through Schiff-base condensations of TPPDA(NH2)4 with TPPyr(CHO)4 and TPTPE(CHO)4, respectively.119 The TPPDATPPyr and TPPDA-TPTPE COFs were highly thermally resistant, with decomposition temperatures (Td10) of up to 543 and 551 °C, respectively; in addition, they had high surface areas (up to 1020 and 1067 m2 g−1, respectively). Both the TPPDATPPyr and TPPDA-TPTPE COFs underwent reversible redox processes at a low sweep rate (5 mV s−1) over the potential range from +0.18 to −0.92 V, because of their redox-active triphenylamino groups. At a current density of 2 A g−1, the specific capacitance of the TPPDA-TPTPE COF (237.1 F g−1) was higher than that of the TPPDATPPyr COF (188.7 F g−1), due to the higher surface area of the former, as well as the easy access for electrolytes to its electrode surface, thanks to the presence of the heteroatoms. Furthermore, the TPPDATPPyr and TPPDA-TPTPE COFs displayed excellent cycling capacities, with retentions of up to 86.2 and 85.6%, respectively, after 5000 cycles. We have examined the effect of the COF surface area on capacitance through the formation of a sponge-like shell TPT-DAHQ COF through the template-free condensation of TPT-3CHO and DAHQ-2HCl.120 The TPT-DAHQ COF possessed an extraordinary surface area (up to 1855 m2 g−1) in addition to high thermal resistance (up to 452 °C). The high surface area of the TPT-DAHQ COF was the main factor behind its excellent capacitance (up to 256 F g−1 at current density of 0.5 A g−1); it displayed high durability, with up to 98.8% of its original capacitance retained without any obvious degradation after 1850 cycles at 10 A g−1. We also elucidated the effect of the active redox sites in COFs structures through one-pot syntheses of three biflurorenylidene-based COFs BFTB-PyTA, BFTB-BFTB, and BFTB-BCTA through reactions of BFTB-4CHO with PyTA-4NH2, BFTB-4NH2, and BCTA-4NH2, respectively.113 In addition to the BFTB-PyTA, BFTB-BFTB, and BFTB-BCTA COFs displaying record-high thermal resistances of up to 433, 416, and 449 °C, respectively, they also exhibited high BET surface areas (up to 1133, 1040, and 834 m2 g−1, respectively), determined through N2 isothermal analyses at 77 K. The specific capacitances of the BFTB-PyTA and BFTB-BFTB COFs were 68.0 and 84.5 F g−1, respectively, at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1; the specific capacitance of the BFTB-BCTA COF at the same scan rate was higher (89.9 F g−1), although it had the lowest surface area, revealing that the redox-active sites were the carbazole subunits. Furthermore, the smooth surface morphology of the BFTB-BFTB COF played an important role in its specific capacitance being higher than that of the BFTB-PyTA COF, which had a hollow-microtubule structure. The capacitive retentions of the BFTB-PyTA, BFTB-BFTB, and BFTB-BCTA COFs were 97.27, 85.23, and 91.21%, respectively. Using our previously mentioned TFP-COFs, we investigated the effects of redox-active amino, pyridine, and carbazole groups on the reversible redox processes occurring at a low sweep rate of 5 mV s−1. The specific capacitance of the TFP-TPA COF (up to 291.1 F g−1) was higher than those of the TFP-TPP and TFP-Car COFs, due to its higher nitrogen-atom percentage; therefore, it had a greater number of available redox active sites, even though it had a lower surface area. The TFP-TPA COF, TFP-TPP and TFP-Car COFs exhibited high durability after 5000 cycles at 10 A g−1, with retention of their original values of up to 91, 88.2, and 90.4%, respectively.105 Triphenylamine has been a highly studied redox-active unit because of its ability to store energy. Our group investigated the previously mentioned COFs 1–6 to test their validity as supercapacitors. Indeed, the TPA-COFs 1–4 exhibited supercapacitance, whereas the TPT-COFs 5 and 6 did not provide any redox curves during cyclic voltammetry, consistent with their absence of triphenylamine moieties. Notably, the unsaturated NC units do not display any reactivity in acidic media, and increasing the number of triphenylamine groups enhanced the specific capacitance; as a result, the capacitance of TPA-TPA-COF-1, which featured six triphenylamine groups, was higher than those of the other COFs 2–4. Morphologies and chemical structures can also play a role in affecting the specific capacitances of supercapacitors. We confirmed these phenomena in a recent study of the previously mentioned Car-TPA, Car-TPP, and Car-TPT COFs, which possessed carbazole, pyridine, and triphenylamine units, respectively, making them ideal candidates for storing energy; at 0.2 A g−1, they displayed specific capacitances of 13.6, 14.5, and 17.4 F g−1, respectively.103 The Car-TPA and Car-TPP COFs had high surface areas and two redox groups, but provided lower capacitances; in contrast, the Car-TPT COF had a low surface area and only one redox group, but its microtubular structure and molecular design led to enhanced capacitance and retention during the charging/discharging process. Recently, Maha et al. used Sonogashira–Hagihara reactions to prepare a series of CMPs based on tetrabenzonaphthalene (TBN) moieties (TBN-TPE-CMP, TBN-Py-CMP, and TBN-Car-CMP) [Fig. 14(a)].121 Subsequently, we improved the conductivity of these materials by mixing them with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) [Fig. 14(b)]. Interestingly, the capacitance of the TBN-Py-CMP/SWCNT nanocomposite (430 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1) was higher than those of the other samples, presumably because of strong π–π interactions between the pyrene units in the TBN-Py-CMP framework and the SWCNTs.122–125 Eddaoudi et al. prepared Hex-Aza-COF-2 and Hex-Aza-COF-3 through solvothermal condensations of benzoquinone with redox-functionalized aromatic tetramines and phenazine, respectively [Fig. 15(a)].126 They used powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), solid state NMR spectroscopy, BET analysis, SEM, and TEM imaging to investigate the chemical structures, crystallinities, porosities, and morphologies of these materials [Fig. 15(b)–(i)]. The PXRD data and SEM images revealed that both materials had moderate crystallinities and aggregated spherical morphologies. Furthermore, based on electrochemical measurements, the specific capacitances of Hex-Aza-COF-2 (585 F g−1) and Hex-Aza-COF-3 (663 F g−1) were higher than those reported previously for porous polymeric and COF materials. Yang et al. prepared a new porous organic HCP through the reaction of pyrene with CHCl3 as the crosslinker and AlCl3 as the catalyst, with the subsequent hydrolysis affording HcPPy that possessed a high surface area (723 m2 g−1) and micropores (1 nm) and mesopores (2–3 and 3.5–4.5 nm).127 This material functioned as an anode in Li batteries and provided excellent current densities (up to 683 MA h g−1 at 1000 mA g−1). Wong et al. prepared materials named SP and HP through Sonogashira couplings of tri(4-ethynylphenylamine) with 9-ferrocenylidene-2,7-diiodo-9H-fluorene in the presence and absence of ZIF-67, respectively.128 They then prepared Fe-embedded magnetic carbon materials (SP and HP-MCMs) through the carbonization of SP and HP at 500 °C for 1 h. The obtained spherical SP-MCP had a microporous architecture, good redox performance, and good cycling stability when applied in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) as an anode; its performance was superior to that of the HP-MCP. Zhao et al. prepared the 2D-COF-ETTA-ETTCA and COF-ETTA-ETTCA-S materials by loading 88.4 wt% of sulfur and applied these materials in lithium–sulfur batteries.129 The devices displayed high capacity (up to 1617 mA h g−1 at 0.1C), low capacitance decay after 528 cycles, and high coulombic performance (ca. 98%).

3.4. Hydrogen evolution
Chi et al. synthesized a new electrochemical material (PMO10V2@CTF) through the fabrication of PMO10V2 with a cationic CTF as a support, itself prepared through trimerization of 1,3-bis(4-cyanophenyl)imidazolium chloride. PMO10V2@CTF functioned as the catalyst for the production of benzaldehyde and H2 through the oxidation of benzyl alcohol.130 Recently, der Voort et al. prepared metal-free electrocatalysts based on porous BINOL-CTF materials featuring various nitrogen-containing groups (pyridine-N-oxide, pyrrolic-N, quaternary-N, and pyridinic-N/triazine-N units) through cyclization reactions of 2,2′-dihydroxy[1,1′-binaphthalene]-6,6′-dicarbonitrile as the C and N atom sources in molten ZnCl2 at 400 and 500 °C, respectively.131 BINOL-10–500 displayed outstanding performance in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), relative to the other CTF samples, as a result of its large pores, high specific surface area, and high quaternary-N content. Recently, COFs have garnered an exciting position in the field of H2 production because of their ability to facilitate charge transfer and light harvesting. Accordingly, our group applied two of the previously mentioned COFs (PyTA-BC, and PyTA-BC-Ph), based on their excellent photophysical properties, as photocatalysts for H2 evolution from water in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor. The PyTA-BC and PyTA-BC-Ph COFs provided photocatalytic activities of up to 1183 and 417 µmol g−1 h−1, respectively, in the presence of ascorbic acid as the electron donor.132 Jiang et al. prepared, through the in situ growth of TFPT-DETH on the octahedral NH2-UiO-66 surface, an NH2-UiO-66@TFPT-DETH core–shell hetero-framework possessing an octahedral morphology, a smooth surface, a high surface area, light absorption properties, and both meso- and microporous structures; it mediated a high degree of H2 production from water (up to 7178 mmol g−1 h−1) (Fig. 16).133 Interestingly, Guo et al. prepared multivariate Tp(BTxTP1−x)-COFs for photocatalytic H2 evolution from water through condensation of the monomer 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol (Tp) with tertiary phenyl (TP) and benzothiadiazole-derived (BT) units [Fig. 17(a)].134 FTIR and solid state NMR spectroscopy confirmed the chemical structures of the resulting COFs, which possessed highly crystalline structures and high surface areas (>700 m2 g−1) [Fig. 17(b)–(e)]. The H2 evolution rate increased to 9839 µmol g−1 h−1 when the COF material contained 5 mol% of BT.

3.5. Chemical sensing
Laskar et al. prepared two branched conjugated mesoporous polymers (CMO1 and CMO2) displaying aggregation-induced emission and high quantum yields.135 CMO1 was more sensitive than CMO2 towards trinitrotoluene (TNT) and picric acid, due to the higher pore density and size in CMO1. The Zhong group prepared a highly fluorescent F-CTF-3 porous framework through the condensation of phenamidine hydrochloride with 4,4′-(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-4,7-diyl)dibenzaldehyde.136 This fluorescent material functioned as a chemical sensor for phenylamine (PA) and phenylenediamine (PDA), with detection at concentrations of 11.7 and 1.47 nM, respectively. The excellent luminescence features of COFs can arise in addition to their low densities, high chemical stabilities, and high thermal stabilities, making them promising candidates for use as fluorescent sensors. Often, π-conjugation of the building blocks (e.g., triazine, carbazole, pyrene, and triphenylene) or the inherently rigid structure of the COFs leads to this fluorescence behavior. We reported the first applicable COF for the detection of amino acids. We used solvothermal conditions to prepare a Cu@TFPB-DHTH COF (Fig. 18) through polycondensation of TFPB-3CHO and DHTH and subsequent modification with Cu2+ ions.137 The BET surface area of the TFPB-DHTH COF was 360 m2 g−1; it displayed high thermal stability up to 322 °C. The TFPB-DHTH COF exhibited highly fluorescent yellow emission in addition to high chemical stability; the addition of Cu2+ ions quenched this fluorescence, due to aggregation. Anions had only marginal effects on this quenching. The fluorescence intensity increased upon the addition of cysteine and L-histidine. The limits of detection (LODs) for cysteine and L-histidine in the presence of the Cu@TFPB-DHTH COF were 340 and 520 nM, respectively, with high selectivity. Fluorescent COFs have also been used for the spectroscopic determination of very low concentrations (nanomolar) of HCl. We have fabricated the three luminescent COFs BCTB-PD, BCTA-TP, and BCTB-BCTA through Schiff base condensations of BCTB-4CHO with PD, BCTA-4NH2 with TP, and BCTB-4CHO with BCTA-4NH2, respectively.138 The thermal stabilities of the BCTB-PD and BCTB-BCTA COFs were higher than that of the BCTA-TP COF, revealing the positive effect of BCTB-4CHO as the aldehydic building block. The BET surface areas of the BCTB-PD, BCTB-BCTA, and BCTA-TP COFs were 2212, 1098, and 645 m2 g−1, respectively. Noncovalent interactions (hydrogen bonding, dipole effects) between these COFs and polar solvents led to red-shifting upon increasing the solvent polarity, in addition to enhancing the stability of the excited states of the COFs and, hence, their corresponding intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). The BCTB-4CHO-based COFs (BCTB-PD and BCTB-BCTA) displayed fluorescence emissions because their BCTB-4CHN units functioned as electron donating groups that facilitated ICT between the carbazole BCTB-4CHN units and the acceptors; in contrast, the weakly electron donating BCTA-4NCH groups resulted in weak fluorescence for the BCTA-TP COF. The BCTB-BCTA COF displayed high fluorescence sensitivity for the detection of HCl, due to the increasing planarity of its constituent units upon protonation of the imino nitrogen atoms in the BCTB-BCTA COF architecture, resulting in red-shifting of the signal. The fluorescence lifetime of the BCTB-BCTA COF increased from 4.13 to 4.89 ns upon exposure to 1 mmol L−1 HCl, in addition to displaying an LOD of 10 nmol L−1. Increasing the planarity of the units in the COFs and converting them into quinoid structures were exploited by our group for HCl sensing using 2D PyTA-BC and PyTA-BC-Ph COFs, prepared through Schiff base condensations of PyTA-4NH2 with BC-4CHO and BC-Ph-4CHO, respectively, and separately under solvothermal conditions.125 The PyTA-BC and PyTA-BC-Ph COFs had thermal stabilities of up to 403 and 421 °C, respectively, and high surface areas (520 and 1445 m2 g−1, respectively); we attribute the superior thermal stability and surface area of the PyTA-BC-Ph COFs to their longer building blocks. Both the PyTA-BC and PyTA-BC-Ph COFs exhibited solvatochromism phenomena and red-shifting of their signals occurred, due to strong hydrogen bonding between the amino groups on the COF surfaces and the CO groups of the polar solvents, which facilitated ICT. Interactions of the PyTA-BC and PyTA-BC-Ph COFs with HCl also induced red-shifting from their original yellow color; the signals reverted back after exposure to NH3 vapor. This process, which could be repeated without considerable performance loss, resulted from the increase in planarity upon protonation and the formation of quinoid structures. The PyTA-BC and PyTA-BC-Ph COFs had very low LODs for HCl of 24 and 20 nmol L−1, respectively.132 Guo et al. obtained a new 1D-COF with a specific surface area of 426 m2 g−1 and thermal stability up to 360 °C through the reaction of TFPPy and DABP; they used this COF as a chemical H+ sensor in acidic solutions.139 Zhu et al. prepared a dual-luminescent COF (DL-COF) through Schiff base formation between ETTA and 9,10-anthracenedicarboxaldehyde and used it for the chemical sensing of explosive nitro compounds with high selectivity and sensitivity.140 Mohamed et al. used Heck reactions to prepare the four ultrastable microporous polymers An-HPP, TPT-HPP, Car-HPP, and TPE-HPP from octavinylsilsesquioxane (OVS) and brominated anthracene triphenyltriazine, bicarbazole, and tetraphenylethene, respectively; we revealed that these materials displayed good thermal stabilities because of the presence of the inorganic POSS units and the high crosslinking densities.141–144 Furthermore, these four fluorescent materials could be used for the detection of Fe3+ ions.

3.6. Other applications
Ning et al. prepared two CMPs containing organic dyes in their backbones through Sonogashira couplings of TDFB and TCT with TEB (Fig. 19).145 The TDFB-TEB CMP possessed a narrower band gap and a more planar π-conjugated structure and displayed higher photocatalytic performance towards the aerobic oxidants sulfur and amines with excellent recycling, compared with the behavior of TCT-TEF. Ma et al. reported CMP-S1, a CMP containing aromatic naphthalene moieties and a conjugated structure, that exhibited higher performance for aromatic capture than that for alkanes, based on organic vapor adsorption analysis.146 Xia et al. synthesized pTTT-BTD, pTTT-Ben, and pTTT-DMOB CMPs from 2,4,6-(tri-2-thienyl)-1,3,5-triazine as the knot block and the linkers BTD, Ben, and BMOB, respectively, each with different morphologies and electronic and optical properties. Interestingly, pTTT-Ben exhibited high photocatalytic performance, providing high production rates of succinic acid (4.66 mmol g−1 h−1) and 2,5-diformylfuran (0.53 mmol g−1 h−1) from biomass materials.147 Zhang et al. incorporated phosphoric acid into porous solids through Sonogashira coupling of 1,3,5-tris(4-ethynylphenyl)benzene with various aliphatic perfluoro monomers (Fig. 20).148 The obtained electrolytes of the CMP polymers had a low activation energy (0.4 eV) and high proton conductivity (4.39 × 10−3 S cm−1), due to their hydrophobic pores and hydrogen bonding between phosphoric acid and the perfluoroalkyl chains of the CMPs. Zhao et al. obtained the thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole-linked CMPs TZTZ-TA and TZTZ-TP through condensations of 1,3,5-tri(4-formylphenyl)benzene with 2,4,6-tri(4-formylphenyl)-1,3,5-triamine (as the C3 symmetrical anode block) and with dithiooxamide (as the C2 monomer), respectively.149 The obtained CMPs had amorphous characteristics, different colors, good thermal stabilities, and BET surface areas in the range from 314.8 to 439.5 m2 g−1. Furthermore, the TZTZ-TA CMP containing the triazine units mediated the production of NADH (82.0 wt% within 5 min) to an outstanding degree when compared with that of TZTZ-TP (6.9 wt% during 10 min). Lang et al. prepared a different series of CMPs, based on fluorene and carbazole units as electron donating groups, and observed that MFC-CMP displayed a high BET specific surface area, more sites for oxidation, and good performance in the production of imines and oxygen through amine oxidation under visible light photocatalysis.150 Hua and co-workers used Sonogashira coupling to prepare a series of fluorescent CMPH, CMPNH2, and CMPN materials containing amino groups. CMPN, which featured N,N-diethylpropylamine units as side chains in the framework, exhibited good I2 capacity and excellent stability towards β- and γ-ray irradiation, which was the result of the formation of charge-transfer complexes between I2 and the amino, phenyl, and triazine groups.151 Maji et al. constructed a CMP containing dithienyl units as photochromic groups through Schiff-base condensation of dithienylethene aldehyde and benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxyhydrazide [Fig. 21(a)].152 They investigated its porosity, chemical structure, morphology, and optical and crystallinity properties [Fig. 21(e)–(t)]. The pcCMP-O structure had a yellow color that, after UV irradiation, changed to give the deep-green pcCMP-C; in addition, pcCMP-O functioned as an NH function logic gate. Li and co-workers prepared a metal-free heterogeneous catalyst (2,5-DCP-CTF) through the cyclotrimerization of 2,5-dicyanopyridine in the presence of molten ZnCl2.153 2,5-DCP-CTF possessed a high nitrogen atom content and a hierarchical porous structure; they used it for the preparation of cyclic carbonates with high selectivity and for the conversion of CO2. Hu et al. used silicon-promoted cationic polymerization to synthesize a series of HCPs with outstanding chemical stability, surface area, tunable porosity, and extended conjugation, which were capable of capturing dibenzothiophene (1335 mg g−1).154 Hou et al. prepared TFPPy-Td-COFs with a high surface area (1094 m2 g−1) and uniform pore size (2.87 nm) through the condensation of TFPPy with thiadiazole-2HN2.155 Interestingly, they prepared polymethylacrylates with a narrow polydispersity index when using TFPPy-Td-COFs as a heterogeneous photocatalyst for atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) photo-induced polymerization under irradiation with white light in the presence of Cu(I). In 2019, Chen et al. prepared two kinds of donor–acceptor 2D-COFs (TPB-BT-COF, and TAPT-BT-COF), featuring benzothiadiazole (BT) units as electron acceptors, through condensation reactions (Fig. 22).156 These materials possessed outstanding porosities, were chemically stable under strongly acidic and basic conditions, and had high crystallinities. The rate of photoreduction of an aqueous solution of hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] in the presence of the TPB-BT-COF was faster than that in the presence of the TAPT-BT-COF, due to the former having a narrower band gap and an abundant negative conduction band, allowing facile migration and separation of hole pairs/photogenerated electrons. In 2020, Jiang et al. synthesized the sp2-N enriched TM-TPT-COF through the reaction of TM with TPT in the presence of a basic catalyst.157 They then prepared Pt@COF through the reaction of the TM-TPT-COF with K2PtCl4; the presence of Pt NPs in the COF layers was confirmed using high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and WT-extended XAFS (EXAFS). The ORR mediated by the fabricated Pt@COF electrocatalyst in an acidic electrolyte was superior to that of a commercial Pt/C catalyst. In 2020, Huang et al. constructed a 2D-COF based on porphyrin units (TAPP-TFPP-COF) from the reaction of TAPP with TFPP; it exhibited excellent crystallinity, stability, tetragonal micropores, a high BET surface area of 962 m2 g−1 and a pore size of 1.8 nm (Fig. 23).158 The conductivity of the TAPP-TFPP-COF after doping with I2 increased from 1.12 × 10−10 to 1.46 × 10−7 S cm−1; furthermore, TAPP-TFPP-COF films displayed high sensitivity and selectivity at 700 nm, based on spectroscopic detection. Our group contributed to the development of perovskite solar cells through the preparation of the 2D-COFs Car-ETTA and TFPPy-ETTA through [4+4] solvothermal condensations of ETTA with Car-4CHO and TFPPy, respectively. The Car-ETTA and TFPPy-ETTA COFs possessed high thermal stabilities (up to 467 and 580 °C, respectively) and high surface areas (829 and 1156 m2 g−1, respectively). Perovskite solar cells modified with the Car-ETTA and TFPPy-ETTA COFs displayed high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), up to 19.79 and 19.72%, respectively, resulting from minimized charge recombination at the perovskite-PTAA-COF interfaces, due to low energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbitals of the COFs.159

4. Conclusion and Outlook
POPs, including CTFs, COFs, HCPs, and CMPs, are attractive porous materials, and are comparable with metal–organic framework inorganic zeolites, because they possess excellent chemical and thermal stabilities, low densities, and tunable porosities, while being easy to prepare with flexible designs and structural diversity. These porous materials have been applied as useful platforms in many fields, including energy storage and conversion, gas separation, chemical sensing, luminescence, electronic devices, drug delivery, and H2 evolution from water. In this review, we discuss many examples of recent progress in the preparation of these materials, as well as the excellent performance of some POPs applied for CO2 uptake, energy storage, H2 evolution, photocatalysis, and photovoltaics. In the past few years, many research groups have prepared such materials with excellent properties; nevertheless, the use of novel synthetic methods for the preparation of new CMPs, CTFs, and COF remains worthwhile. For example, even COF materials with Frank–Kasper phases or Archimedean tiling patterns could have specific applications, and are interesting to consider. Finally, further exploration of the properties and applications of new POP materials will continue to open doors in both academia and industry.
