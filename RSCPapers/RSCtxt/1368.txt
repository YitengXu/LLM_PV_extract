, Accepted 27th November 2013First published on 28th November 2013AbstractA bilayer-structured film photoelectrode, containing an under-layer of reduced graphene oxide–WO3 nanocrystals (G-WNC) or WO3 nanocrystals (WNC) and a top layer of WO3 vertically plate-like arrays (WP), was designed and fabricated by solution-based and hydrothermal methods. The morphologies, structural and optical properties of as-prepared composites were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and ultraviolet visible (UV-Vis) spectrometry. Moreover, the photoelectrochemical properties were studied through linear scan voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE). It was found that the photocurrents of WP, WNC/WP and G-WNC/WP films were 0.68, 0.80 and 1.23 mA cm−2 at 1.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) under AM 1.5G illumination, respectively, whereas the IPCE values were 28.12%, 31.33% and 39.52% successively at the wavelength of 355 nm. EIS data illustrated that the charge transfer resistance was clearly reduced by introducing graphene in the underlayer of the composite film. The enhancement of G-WNC/WP film could be ascribed to the synergic effects of the bilayer structure and the limitation of charge recombination.
1. Introduction
Global warming is caused by the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere due to the use of fossil fuels.1 In order to decrease the negative impact on the environment, the development of carbon-free or carbon-neutral energy resources is necessary. As the only source of renewable energy, solar energy has a better prospect than other energy options. And there are many technologies to using it, such as solar thermal power,2 photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices3 and solar cells.4
In 1972, titanium dioxide (TiO2) was firstly used for the PEC splitting of water by Fujishima and Hondameans.5 Since then, kinds of semiconductor catalysts such as ZnO, BiVO4 and WO3 have been utilized by an increasing number of researchers to improve the efficiency of photoelectric conversion.6–17 Besides TiO2 and ZnO, WO3 is also a high reactive, excellently photocorrosion resistive, non-toxic and inexpensive material. Moreover, the band gap of WO3 (2.5–2.8 eV) is narrower than that of TiO2 (3.2 eV for anatase form) and ZnO (3.37 eV), which makes it possible to absorb more visible light.6,16–18 In the last few years, several morphologies of WO3 (like flower, urchin-like, nanotube-based bundles and leaf-like nanoplatelets) have been applied to photolysis of water in particulate suspension system.8–11 In order to recover the catalyst and promote the efficiency of water splitting, WO3 are prepared as films in the PEC cell system. And the morphologies of films are mesoporous, nanoparticles, and vertically aligned nanostructured arrays (nanowire, plate-like).12–15,19
The nanoparticles photoelectrodes have a high internal surface area and mesoporosity. However, the film leads to a high transparency of light and negligible light scattering. Worse still, the surface defects or trapping sites of the film may increase charge recombination so as to retard the electron transfer resulting from electron–hole recombination at grain boundaries in thick film.20,21 The diameters of vertically aligned nanostructured arrays are larger than half wavelength of the light so that they have a great light-harvesting efficiency.22 At the same time, the film shows great conversion efficiency because of a superior charge transport path with vertical transportation of charge carriers minimizing the recombination factor. However, the vertical arrays on F-doped tin oxide (FTO) may lead FTO surface contacting the electrolyte so that back-transport of the electrons occurs at the interface.23 In order to compromise light scattering and back-transport reaction, several researchers fabricate double-layer composite films, which consist of an underlayer of small particles and a top layer of large size structured arrays (microspheres,22,24,25 flowers,26 nanotubes27 and nanowires28). The top layer can be illuminated enough owing to the nanoparticles of the underlayer's high transparency. Meanwhile, the excellent light scattering of top layer can reflect a portion of transmitted light back to the underlayer.26 So the optical transfer length of photoelectrode is prolonged to enhance light harvesting efficiency (Scheme 1). However, the drawback of recombination in the underlayer still needs to be overcome.

Graphene, a two-dimensional material of sp2 carbon atoms, has attracted intense interests because of exceptionally electric, thermal, mechanical and optical properties.29 Since firstly reported in 2004, numbers of scientists have fabricated compounds of graphene and semiconductor to improve the properties, one of which is enhancing the PEC conversion efficiency by improving the electron transport rate.7,30–32 And the composites of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and WO3 used for gas sensing,33 protein degradation,34 photocatalysis,35,36 photolysis of water37 and other applications38,39 have been reported. In addition, few searchers focus on using graphene in the double layer films to reduce charge recombination rate, thus enhancing the efficiency of PEC. Recently, Sung et al. reported that RGO–TiO2 nanocomposites as an interfacial layer to reduce the back-transport reactions in dye-sensitized solar cells.40 However, to the best of our knowledge, the RGO–WO3 compounds as underlayer in the double layers system of WO3 has not been investigated.
In this study, we synthesized the composite nanocrystals of RGO–WO3 as underlayer by solution-based method, and fabricated the vertical plate-like WO3 on compounds nanocrystal layer by hydrothermal method. In order to inspect the effect of graphene, the structural and optical properties of as-prepared composites were evaluated by scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and ultraviolet visible (UV-Vis) spectrometry. In the meantime, the photoelectrochemical properties of the bilayer-structured films were systematically investigated by linear sweep voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE).
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Graphite powder (325 meshes) was supplied by Alfa-Aesar. The F-doped tin oxide coated glass substrates (FTO) were purchased from NSG Corporation, Japan. Other reagents were procured from Sinoreagent, China. All chemicals were analytical grade and used without further purification. Unless otherwise specified, the deinonized water (DI, 18.2 MΩ cm at 25 °C) was used during the experimental process.
2.2 Preparation of WO3 and RGO–WO3 nanocrystal layer
RGO–WO3 nanocrystal layer was fabricated from ammonium metatungstate ((NH4)6W7O24·6H2O) and graphene oxide (GO) using solution-based method and thermal treatment, which is a modification of Lin's method.37 And the GO was prepared from graphite powder using a modification of Hummers's method.41–43 Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP K-30, 2.0 g) was dissolved in DI water (15.0 mL), and GO dispersion (10 mL) was added in under stirring. Then, 1 M ammonium metatungstate solution (5 mL) was mixed into and stirring 2 h. After then, 2.0 g polyethylene glycol (PEG1000) was added and stirred for additional 4 h. After being ultrasonically cleaned in acetone/isopropanol/methanol/DI water and then blow-dried by nitrogen, the FTO glass substrates were dipped into the precursor solution for 3 min and pulled with rate of 44 mm min−1. Finally, the resulting RGO–WO3 film (denoted as G-WNC film) was dried at ambient temperature overnight and calcined at 450 °C for 2.5 h under air with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1. The WO3 film (denoted as WNC film) was also fabricated using a similar procedure without adding GO for comparison. Simultaneously, GO film was prepared by dipping the FTO into the aqueous dispersion of GO, and RGO was prepared from GO using thermal decomposition method.44
2.3 Preparation of WO3 vertical plate-like arrays
The top layer was synthesized by hydrothermal method, using Na2WO4 as the precursor of WO3 and (NH4)2C2O4 as structure-directing agent. In the process, 0.231 g Na2WO4 was dissolved into 30 mL DI water and 6 mL 3 M HCl was dropped into the solution. After stirring 10 min, 0.2 g (NH4)2C2O4 was added with additional stirring for 20 min, and the solution was diluted with 34 mL DI water. The FTO coated by WNC or G-WNC layer was leaned against the wall before transporting the solution into the Teflon-lined stainless autoclave (100 mL volume). The autoclaves were placed in the oven at 120 °C for 6 h. After cooling to room temperature, the films were washed with DI water and absolute alcohol, and then dried at 55 °C for 2 h. Finally, the products were annealed at 450 °C for 1 h under air with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 (denoted as WNC/WP and G-WNC/WP film, respectively). For comparison, the controlled experiments were conducted to fabricate single layer film of WO3 vertical plate-like arrays with FTO as substate (denoted as WP film).
2.4 Characterization
The morphologies and microstructures of the samples were investigated by SEM (JSM6700F, JEOL Company, Japan) and TEM (TECNAI G2 F20, FEI, Japan). The crystalline phases were obtained on an X-ray diffractometer (D/Max2250, Rigaku Corporation, Japan) using graphite monochromatic copper radiation (Cu Kα, λ = 0.154056 nm) in the diffraction angle (2θ) between 5° and 70° at a step size of 10° per minute. The light absorbance measurements of the films were performanced by a diffused reflectance ultraviolet and visible spectrophotometer (UV-Vis, Shimadzu 2450) with integrating sphere, employing BaSO4 as a reflectance standard. FTIR spectra were evaluated by a Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR, Nicolet, 6700, USA).
2.5 Photoelectrochemical measurements
To investigate the photoelectrochemical properties of all the prepared samples, a three-electrode system was used with an electrochemical analyzer (Zennium, Zahner, Germany). The as-prepared films, platinum foil and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) were used as working electrodes, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The active areas of electrodes were dipped into the electrolyte of 0.5 M H2SO4 solution with an optical quality quartz window to allow AM 1.5G illumination. The photocurrents were collected in a potential range from 0 V to 1.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) as linearly scan rate of 20 mV s−1. And the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were monitored at a single constant potential (0.8 V vs. AgCl) with 10 mV potential perturbation amplitude in the frequency range 0.1 Hz–10 kHz. In the meantime, the incident photo to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was carried out as a function of wavelength from 300 to 700 nm. And the IPCE values were calculated with the system equipped with a xenon lamp light source (LSH-X150, Zolix Instruments Co., Ltd.), a monochrometor (Omni-λ300, Zolix Instruments Co., Ltd.), a data collection system (DCS300PA, Zolix Instruments Co., Ltd.), and a Si detector (QE-B3, OSI Optoelectronics).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Morphology and structural characterization
Fig. 1 shows the SEM and TEM images of WO3 nanocrystals and RGO–WO3 nanocrystals. Both of the films show nanostructured porous morphology containing uniform spherical shape particles. It is probably caused by the combustion and decomposition of PVP and PEG during the calcination process and the connection of small nanoparticles. From the TEM image of Fig. 1(c) and (d), the average diameter of WO3 particles is about 20 nm, and the WO3 particles wrapped by gauze-like RGO have the similar diameter.

The morphologies and microstructures of the WP, WNC/WP and G-WNC/WP films were also investigated by SEM and depicted in Fig. 2. The top-view image in Fig. 2(a) reveals that WO3 grow nearly vertical to the FTO substrate forming plate-like array. In Fig. 2(b) and (c), the WNC/FTO and G-WN/FTO substrates are also covered by vertically plate-like WO3 nanostructures as similar dimensions as WO3 plate-like array on FTO substrate. From the cross section of WP film in Fig. 2(d), the vertically nanostructured arrays cannot cover the smooth FTO completely with some voids. So the electrolyte can encounter the FTO glass, and the electrons might back transfer from photoelectrode to electrolyte, thus reducing the effective charge into the external circuit and decreasing the efficiency of photoelectric conversion. As can be seen from the Fig. 2(e), the WNC layer and WP layer can be clearly recognized with the thickness of 0.62 μm and 1.36 μm, respectively. The grain size of WO3 at the interface between WNC and WP is larger than that of the WO3 nanocrystals, which is a result of the WO3 nanocrystal as the initial seed crystal of vertical arrays. It also can be observed that the interfacial contact between small WO3 nanoparticles and FTO glass is improved so that the voids are disappeared. The G-WNC/WP film has the similar morphology as WNC/WP film with the thickness of 0.65 μm and 1.36 μm, respectively.

Fig. 3(a) shows the typical XRD patterns of GO, RGO, WNC and G-WNC films. The peak of GO at 10.3° corresponds to interlayer distance of 0.86 nm which is larger than that of graphite (0.34 nm), implying that various oxygen-containing functional groups are formed on the surface of GO sheets after oxidation.32 And the other peaks are well matched with the diffraction lines documented for tetragonal SnO2 (JCPDS no. 46-1088), indicating GO is coating on FTO by dip-coating method. After thermal reduction, only a broad peak at 25.4°, corresponding to an interlayer spacing of about 0.35 nm. The WNC and G-WNC films show the same diffraction peaks regardless of a slight difference in intensity. It means that the RGO restricts the growth of nanoparticles, because the nanoparticles contacting RGO decrease the contact among WO3 nanoparticles. The peaks of the WN and WNG samples are in accord with monoclinic WO3 (JCPDS no.83-0950) and tetragonal SnO2 (JCPDS no. 46-1088). However, no typical diffraction peaks of GO or RGO were detected in the composite films, which could be ascribed to two probable reasons. One is that the regular stacking and the oxygen-containing functional group of GO were destroyed by the calcination process.30 The other is that graphene sheets are highly isolated by WO3 nanoparticles so that the content of RGO is too little to be resolved after thermal treatment method.44

The XRD patterns of the as prepared WP film, WNC/WP film and G-WNC/WP film are also shown in Fig. 3(b). For the films, the peaks at 2θ values of about 23.58, 26.59, 28.93, 34.16, 41.89, 49.93, 50.73, 55.93, 61.67° can be indexed to (020), (120), (112), (202), (222), (400), (114), (420), (422) crystal planes of crystalline monoclinic WO3 (JCPDS no.83-0950). Furthermore, in addition to the above peaks, G-WNC/WP has a peak at 16.86° indexed to (101) crystal plane of monoclinic WO3.
3.2 FTIR spectra
Fig. 4 displays the FTIR spectra of GO, RGO, WO3 nanocrystal, and RGO–WO3 nanocrystal. The spectrum of GO illustrates the presence of C–O (νC–O at 1089 cm−1 in alkoxy), C–OH (νC–OH at 1384 cm−1), and CO (νCO at 1733 cm−1 in carboxylic acid and carbonyl moieties). The peaks at 1631 and 3430 cm−1 are originated from the stretching deformation vibration of molecular water. The spectra also show two peaks at 2854 and 2923 cm−1 that are related to asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of CH2.45 The peak at 1733 cm−1 is disappearing for RGO, whereas the peak at 1089 cm−1 is existent, which means that GO was considerable deoxygenation by thermal treatment.46 Thereinto, the residual C–O band at 1089 cm−1 may be caused by interaction between WO3 and RGO. Compared with the absorption peaks of WO3 nanocrystal at 767 and 815 cm−1 (corresponding to W–O–W groups), the peaks of RGO–WO3 shift to a lower wavenumber (763 and 813 cm−1) and become broader. It may be a superposition of 628 and 763 cm−1, indicating a chemical band of C–O–W between WO3 and RGO.

3.3 UV-Vis spectra
To study the optical properties of three kinds of film electrodes, diffused reflectance spectra were measured and displayed in Fig. 5. An intense absorption at wavelength shorter than 450 nm is observed for the WP film, which is ascribed to the intrinsic band gap absorption of WO3 due to the electrons transit from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB).30,32,47 The WNC/WP film has the similarly steep absorption edge as WP film with better diffused reflectance at 470–650 nm. And the G-WNC/WP film shows a red shift of absorption edge compared with the WNC/WP film, which can be assigned to the doping of C into the WO3 lattice and the hybridization of C2p and O2p atomic orbits.48,49 So the photosemiconductor can be excitated by the longer wavelength light with the less photon energy. Therefore, the introduction of RGO into the matrix of G-WNC/WP film can promote the visible light response of solar spectrum, which facilitates the photoelectron conversion efficiency.

3.4 Photoelectrochemical properties
To investigate the photoresponsivity of the films, the current densities were measured using linear sweep voltammetry method in a potential range from 0 V to 1.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) as scan rate of 20 mV s−1. As shown in Fig. 6, there are oxidation peaks between 0 and 0.3 V, which reflect the ability of ion implantation. Then, the current densities of all samples increase steeply with increasing the potential. At 1.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), the current densities are 0.68, 0.80 and 1.23 mA cm−2 for WP, WNC/WP and G-WNC/WP films under illumination, respectively. In other words, the photocurrents of WNC/WP and G-WNC/WP films are 1.18 and 1.81 times of WP film, respectively. After chopping the light at 1.21 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), the signals decrease to zero nearly. Then the photocurrent comes back to 0.77, 0.91 and 1.38 mA as soon as the light irradiate on the samples again at 1.32 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The current density of WNC/WP film is larger than that of WP film, which can be ascribed to the light scattering capacity of the WP layer so as to promote the light harvesting of WNC layer.26 But the increasing is slight because the recombinations happen on the surface of WO3 nanocrystals easily. Compared with WNC/WP, the photocurrent of G-WNC/WP film is higher, indicating that the mix of graphene accelerate the electron transfer from WO3 to FTO with suppressing the recombination of electron–hole pairs.
 Fig. 6  Photocurrent densities for WP film, WNC/WP film and G-WNC/WP film at applied potential. 
To better support the above ideas, the electron transport properties were assessed utilizing EIS under illumination condition. In Fig. 7, the impedance spectra consist of semicircle portions at the intermediate-frequency region are associated with electron transport and recombination at the WO3/FTO interface. It can be fitted to an equivalent circuit including a series resistance (Rs), a charge transfer resistance (Rct) and a constant phase element (CPE), and the data are collected in Table 1. The Rs is influenced by the sheet resistance of electrode and electrolyte, which can be detected at high frequency around 10 kHz. And the Rct, which is related to the diameter of the circle, is inversely proportional to the efficiency of charge separation. As can be seen, the Rs of the films are comparable. However, the Rct of WNC/WP film is less than WP film because the nanoparticles have a larger contact area with FTO. And an obviously decrease is caused when RGO was introduced into the WNC/WP film, leading to high light conversion efficiency in PEC.

In order to quantitatively assess the photocatalysis ability of the various working electrodes as a function of wavelength, IPCE measurements were performed at 1.2 V vs. RHE. The WP and WNC/WP films show a strong photon response at 300–470 nm, whereas the G-WNC/WP film displays higher IPCE values at 300–485 nm. And the photon response regions are in concurrence with the above diffused reflection results. In Fig. 8, the IPCE value of WNC/WP film is larger than that of the WP film. By introducing graphene, the efficiencies are enhanced over the whole photon response region of the G-WNC/WP film, especially in the wavelength of 325–375 nm. And the maximum values for all samples are at the wavelength of 355 nm, which are 28.12%, 31.33% and 39.52%, respectively. However, all the films show the similar absorption of light in the wavelength ranging from 325 to 375 nm in Fig. 5. It indicates that the enhancement of IPCE is assigned to accelerating the electron transfer and suppressing the recombination of electron–hole pairs by introducing graphene.

4. Conclusion
In summary, the under layer consist of RGO–WO3 nanocrystals or WO3 nanocrystals and the top layer consist of WO3 vertically plate-like arrays were designed and fabricated for double-layered semiconducting photoelectrode by solution-based and hydrothermal methods. Compared with the WNC/WP film, the G-WNC/WP film shows a red shift of absorption edge as a result of the chemical bonding between RGO and WO3. And the G-WNC/WP film has a larger photocurrent than WNC/WP film because graphene can reduce the defects and decrease charge recombination rate. The electrochemical impedance spectra prove that G-WNC/WP film possessed the lowest transfer resistance, which is ascribed to graphene provide a freeway to accelerate the charge transfer to FTO. Moreover, the IPCE is improved from 31.33% (WNC/WP film) to 39.52% (G-WNC/WP film) at 355 nm. The concept of bilayer structured film would help us to enhance the photoelectric conversion efficiency of photoanode, and the underlayer of RGO and WO3 composites provide a new route to boost the efficiency of DSSC based on WO3 photoanode.
