    , Accepted 15th April 2015First published on 17th April 2015AbstractTwo star-shaped molecules of TPA(BT–2Cz)3 and TPA(BT–3Cz)3 with a triphenyl-amine (TPA) core were designed and synthesized, in which 2- and 3-carbazolyl units (2Cz and 3Cz) are attached to the benzothiadiazole (BT) arms as planar terminal groups, respectively. Although both molecules show a similar broad UV-Vis absorption covering from 300 nm to 560 nm, different photovoltaic performances were observed owing to the varied linked positions of terminal carbazolyl units. In contrast to TPA(BT–2Cz)3-based solar cells, solution-processable organic solar cells (OSCs) based on TPA(BT–3Cz)3 exhibited better photovoltaic performance with the maximum power conversion efficiency up to 3.94% and an enhanced short-circuit current of 8.80 mA cm−2. This work further demonstrates that tuning the substituted position of the terminal carbazolyl group can significantly improve the photovoltaic performance of its resulting small molecules.
1 Introduction
Solution processable organic solar cells (OSCs) exhibit great potential in large area applications due to their advantages of low cost, light weight and capability to fabricate flexible devices.1–4 Among them, bulk hetero-junction (BHJ) OSCs using small molecules (SMs) as donor materials are under intense investigation because these SMs have well-defined molecular structures, no end group contaminants, and good batch-to-batch reproducibility.3–5 Currently, significant progress has been made for these SM based organic solar cells (SM-OSCs) with the achievement of power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 6–10%.6–10 However, in contrast to their polymer counterparts, SM-OSCs still show an inferior photovoltaic performance and some key parameters, such as short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF), have not been improved well.11 Therefore, developing novel SMs with broad and strong absorption to sunlight, matched energy levels and high carrier mobility is still needed.1–4 One facile strategy is to construct D–A-type SMs using an appropriate electron-rich moiety (D) and electron-deficient moiety (A) resulting in intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT).12,13 On the other hand, star-shaped molecules usually exhibit much stronger absorption and higher hole mobility than their linear counterparts, which could lead to an enhanced Jsc and PCE.14 For instance, Li et al. reported a series of triphenylamine (TPA)-based SMs with different spatial configurations and found that these SMs with three-armed configuration (t-TPA–BT) displayed not only a much broader and stronger absorption, but also a better photovoltaic performance than those of bi-armed and linear molecules.15 Based on the above consideration, star-shaped D–A-type conjugated SMs are paid more and more attention currently.16
As is known, TPA and its derivatives exhibited high hole mobility and good solution processability benefiting from their three-dimensional (3-D) spatial structure and are widely used as a donor unit to construct D–A type molecules for applications in OSCs.17–21 The 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) unit has been demonstrated to be a promising type of acceptor building block due to its good electron-withdrawing nature.22–25 Some researchers developed a type of star-shaped molecule containing both TPA and BT building blocks22–24 and found that the increased photovoltaic performances were obtained by tuning the terminal groups for these TPA–BT-based molecules. However, satisfactory results have not been obtained yet.
Recently, our group reported another star-shaped molecule containing the TPA central unit and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) arms, and found that introducing planar terminal groups of phenanthrenes (PN) can enhance the photovoltaic performance of this TPA–DPP-based molecule in OSCs significantly.18 Based on this achievement, we try to design novel star-shaped TPA–BT-based molecules by introducing a new planar terminal group in order to further improve their photovoltaic performance. As the carbazolyl (Cz) unit has a planar molecular structure as well as good chemical and environmental stability,26–28 the topology, absorption, energy level and hole mobility of its SMs were found to be tuned easily by altering the carbazolyl coupling position in SMs.29–31 Therefore, in this paper, we utilized TPA as a core, BT as three arms and different substituted carbazolyl units as terminal groups to design two star-shaped molecules of TPA(BT–2Cz)3 and TPA(BT–3Cz)3, which bear 2-carbazolyl (2Cz) and 3-carbazolyl (3Cz) terminal groups, respectively. A similar thermal stability and UV-Vis absorption profile from 300 nm to 560 nm were observed for both SMs. However, compared to their counterparts, TPA(BT–2Cz)3 showed a lower HOMO energy level and TPA(BT–3Cz)3 displayed higher charge carrier mobility. A significant effect of the substituted positions of the carbazolyl unit on the photovoltaic performance of its SMs was further observed in the device with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Active Layer/Ca/Al. Better and improved photovoltaic performance was observed for TPA(BT–3Cz)3-based devices, in which the maximum PCE and Jsc values were 3.94% and 8.80 mA cm−2, respectively. Our results further demonstrated that introducing terminal carbazolyl groups and tuning their linked positions could significantly improve the photovoltaic performance of its SMs in OSCs.

The mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 24 h. The reaction was then quenched with water at ambient temperature and the mixture was extracted with dichloromethane (DCM). The combined organic layer was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) and distilled to remove off the solvent.

2.3 Characterization and measurement
All 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV-400 using CDCl3 as a solvent. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric measurements were performed on a Bruker Bifiex III MALDI TOF. The theoretical study was performed using the density functional theory (DFT), as approximated by the B3LYP employing the 6-31G** basis set in Gaussian09. UV-Vis spectra were measured on a Perkin-Elmer Lamada 25 spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed on a Netzsch TG 209 analyzer and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on a TA Q200 Instrument under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed with a three-electrode electrochemical cell in a 0.1 M tetra(n-butyl)ammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) solution with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 at room temperature under an argon atmosphere. A platinum wire and Ag/AgCl (0.1 M) were used as a counter electrode and a reference electrode, respectively. The thin films on the Pt disk, formed by drop-casting the molecular chloroform solution (analytical reagent, 10 mg mL−1) in the disk, was used as the working electrode. Surface morphologies were recorded using an atomic force microscope (AFM) on a Veeco-DI Multimode NS-3D apparatus in the trapping mode under normal air conditions at room temperature.
2.4 Fabrication and characterization of organic solar cells
Photovoltaic cells were prepared with a traditional sandwich structure through the following steps. First, the indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates were cleaned by a series of ultrasonic treatments in acetone, followed by deionized water, then 2-propanol each for 10 min. The substrates were dried under a stream of nitrogen and subjected to the treatment of Ar/O2 plasma for 5 min. Secondly, a filtered aqueous solution of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS; Bayer AG) was spun-cast onto the cleaned ITO surface at 4000 rpm for 30 s and then baked at 150 °C for 30 min to form a PEDOT:PSS thin film with a thickness of 30 nm. Thirdly, a blend solution of materials and [6,6]-phenyl-C-71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) in chlorobenzene (CB), filtered through a 0.45 µm poly(tetrafluoro-ethylene) filter, was spun cast at 2000 rpm for 30 s onto the PEDOT:PSS layer. The substrates were dried under a N2 atmosphere at room temperature and then annealed at 150 °C for 15 min in a nitrogen-filled glove box. The devices were completed after thermal deposition of a 10 nm calcium and a 100 nm aluminum film as the cathode at a pressure of 6 × 10−4 Pa. The active area was 0.1 cm2 for each cell. The thicknesses of the spun-cast films were recorded using a profilometer (Alpha-Step 200; Tencor Instruments).
Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of devices were measured using a computer-controlled Keithley 2602 source measurement unit in the dark under AM 1.5 G irradiation at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (Oriel 91160, 300 W). The PCE was detected under monochromatic illumination (Oriel Cornerstone 260 1/4 m monochromator equipped with Oriel 70613NS QTH lamp) and the calibration of the incident light was performed with a single-crystalline silicon diode. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured with a silicon photodiode and a computer-controlled light source-monochromator-lock-in system. All device measurements were carried out in air at room temperature.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and thermal stability
The synthetic routes of TPA(BT–2Cz)3 and TPA(BT–3Cz)3are outlined in Scheme 1. As the key precursors of both star-type molecular arms, 2-(7-bromobenzo[c][2,1,3]thiadiazol-4-yl)-9-octyl carbazole (Br–BT–2Cz) and 3-(7-bromobenzo[c][2,1,3]thia-diazol-4-yl)-9-octylcarbazole (Br–BT–3Cz) were prepared through the common Suzuki coupling reaction using Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst (see ESI†). Similarly, TPA(BT–2Cz)3 and TPA(BT–3Cz)3 were easily obtained through a Suzuki coupling reaction in a moderate yield of 50%. Two target SMs were confirmed well by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, TOF-MS and elemental analyses. Like the other star-type molecules, both TPA(BT–2Cz)3 and TPA(BT–3Cz)3 readily dissolve in the common organic solvents, such as DCM, chloroform (CHCl3) and chlorobenzene (CB) at room temperature.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic routes of TPA(BT–2Cz)3 and TPA(BT–3Cz)3. 
The thermal properties of both molecules were evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The recorded TGA and DSC curves are depicted in Fig. S1 (a) and (b), respectively (see ESI†). Their corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. Thermal decomposition temperatures of 469 °C and 463 °C are observed for TPA(BT–2Cz)3 and TPA-(BT–3Cz)3 with a 5% weight loss, respectively, implying that both molecules have good thermal properties. On the other hand, no distinct endothermic and exothermic peaks are exhibited for TPA(BT–3Cz)3 during the heating and cooling processes. However, an endothermic peak at 246 °C and an exothermic peak at approximately 208 °C are observed for TPA(BT–2Cz)3, indicating that different crystalline properties were obtained by altering the linking position of the terminal carbazolyl group.

3.2 Theoretical calculations
The ground-state geometry of TPA(BT–2Cz)3 and TPA(BT–3Cz)3 was fully optimized by density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G** level and an ethyl group was used instead of an octyl group to make the calculation easier. The minimum energy conformations and electron-state-density distributions are represented in Fig. 1. The dihedral angles between phenyl of TPA and BT, as well as between BT and Cz for TPA(BT–3Cz)3 are calculated to be 34.71° and 34.83°, respectively, which are much smaller than the corresponding dihedral angles in TPA(BT–2Cz)3, indicating that TPA(BT–3Cz)3 has a more planar molecular structure than TPA(BT–2Cz)3. Therefore, TPA(BT–3Cz)3 is expected to have better π–π stacking than TPA(BT–2Cz)3 and exhibit the increased Jsc and PCE values.32 In addition, the electron density of HOMO of TPA(BT–3Cz)3 is delocalized on the whole molecule and such a delocalization is much less for TPA(BT–2Cz)3. As a result, TPA(BT–3Cz)3 could have a slightly increasing HOMO energy level in comparison with TPA(BT–2Cz)3. On the other hand, the electron density of LUMO for both molecules is mainly localized on the BT units, which is consistent with the reported literature.25,33

3.3 Optical properties and electrochemical properties
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of TPA(BT–2Cz)3 and TPA(BT–3Cz)3 in chloroform solution and solid films are shown in Fig. 2 and their corresponding absorption data are listed in Table 1. By employing the carbazole unit as the terminal group, broad absorption spectra from 300 nm to 570 nm with two obvious absorption peaks are observed. The high-lying region at about 320 nm corresponds to the π–π* transition and the low-lying region from 400 to 550 nm is assigned to the intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT) interaction between the electron-rich moieties (Cz and TPA) and the electron-deficient moiety (BT).32,34 Compared to the absorption profiles in solution, the ones in thin films exhibited a significant red-shift up to 24–30 nm, which is probably caused by the intermolecular π–π stacking interaction. Similar absorption spectra for both SMs in solutions and thin films imply that the substituted position of the carbazole unit has little effect on the absorption spectra.

Fig. 3 shows the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of TPA(BT–2Cz)3 and TPA(BT–3Cz)3 and their correlated data are also listed in Table 1. The potentials are internally calibrated using the ferrocene/ferrocenium of the (Fc/Fc+) redox couple (4.8 eV below the vacuum level). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels (EHOMO and ELUMO) are calculated to be −5.25 eV/−3.24 eV for TPA(BT–2Cz)3 and −5.18 eV/−3.15 eV for TPA(BT–3Cz)3 from the onset oxidation potential (Eox) and the onset reduction potential (Ered) according to the referenced equations.35 It is noted that TPA(BT–2Cz)3 has a deeper HOMO energy level, which is consistent with our DFT calculation result using the B3LYP/6-31G** model. A lower EHOMO value should be obtained for TPA(BT–2Cz)3 to exhibit higher Voc in OSCs.

3.4 Photovoltaic performance
To probe the photovoltaic properties of both star-shaped molecules, single bulk heterojunction organic solar cells were fabricated by a solution process with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Active Layer/Ca/Al under an optimal spin-coating rate of 2000 rpm. As demonstrated, the blend ratios (w/w) in the photoactive layer could affect the photovoltaic performance of OSCs seriously,36 therefore, the blend ratios of SMs to PC71BM were optimized primarily here, as shown in Fig. S2.† An optimized blend ratio of 1:4 was obtained for solar cells based on both molecules. Fig. 4 displays the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of TPA(BT–2Cz)3 and TPA(BT–3Cz)3-based OSCs under optimized conditions under illumination of AM 1.5 G, 100 mW m−2. Their corresponding photovoltaic data are listed in Table 2. An increased PCE of 3.94% with a Jsc of 8.80 mA cm−2 and a FF of 46.4% is observed in the TPA(BT–3Cz)3-based solar cells under annealing at 110 °C, while the TPA(BT–2Cz)3-based cells exhibited the maximum PCE of 3.11% with a Jsc of 7.69 mA cm−2 and a FF of 40.4%. It is obvious that TPA(BT–3Cz)3 exhibited better photovoltaic performance except the slightly low Voc value in contrast to TPA(BT–2Cz)3 in the OSCs. Therefore, our results here indicate that tuning the substituted position of the carbazolyl unit at the molecular terminal could improve the photovoltaic performance of its SMs. Furthermore, appending the planar carbazolyl terminal group is also an efficient method to achieve the high-performance of photovoltaic molecules.

Fig. 5 shows the external quantum efficiency curves (EQE) of the devices under optimized conditions. The spectral response across the wavelength range of 325–675 nm is clearly observed for both devices. However, while a TPA(BT–2Cz)3-based device is replaced with a TPA(BT–3Cz)3-based device, the EQE is significantly increased from a maximum value of 60% to 75%. It indicates that the photoelectron conversion process is more efficient in the TPA(BT–3Cz)3-based device than the TPA(BT–2Cz)3-based device. A higher EQE value is obtained for TPA(BT–3Cz)3, leading to better photovoltaic performance in the OSCs.

In order to further study why TPA(BT–3Cz)3-based solar cells exhibited better performance, the surface morphologies of the TPA(BT–2Cz)3 and TPA(BT–3Cz)3 blending films with PC71BM under the optimized conditions were recorded by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and are illustrated in Fig. 6. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.4 and 0.6 nm are exhibited for the TPA(BT–2Cz)3 and TPA(BT–3Cz)3 blending films, respectively. It implies that both blending films show a fairly homogeneous surface. However, nanoscopic fibrous phase separation is obviously observed in the TPA(BT–3Cz)3 based blending film. This ordered fibrous morphology should be one of the reasons for the significantly improved Jsc and FF because the inter-fibrillar regions contribute to high exciton dissociation and charge transport efficiency.37

The hole mobility of the blend films was measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method in the hole-only devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Active Layer/Au, which were approximated by the Mott–Gurney equation:38  here J is the current density, εr is the molecular dielectric constant, ε0 is the free-space permittivity (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), d is the thickness of blend films (96 nm and 85 nm for TPA(BT–2Cz)3 and TPA(BT–3Cz)3, respectively), and V = Vappl − Vbi, where Vappl is the applied potential, and Vbi is the built-in potential which results from the difference of the work function between the anode and the cathode. Fig. 7 displays the J1/2–V curves of the hole-only TPA(BT–2Cz)3 and TPA(BT–3Cz)3-based devices. The corresponding hole mobility is listed in Table 2. The hole mobilities up to 7.9 × 10−5 and 9.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 are exhibited in the hole-only TPA(BT–2Cz)3 and TPA(BT–3Cz)3-based devices, respectively. Higher hole mobility for TPA(BT–3Cz)3 is also observed, leading to the FF improvement in the TPA(BT–3Cz)3-based cells.

4 Conclusion
In conclusion, two TPA-cored star-shaped molecules of TPA(BT–2Cz)3 and TPA(BT–3Cz)3 were obtained with 2- and 3-carbazolyl groups at terminals, respectively. Both SMs exhibited good thermal stability and a broad spectral response region covering from 325 to 570 nm. Significantly increased photovoltaic performance was observed in the solution-processable organic solar cells based on TPA(BT–3Cz)3 instead of TPA(BT–2Cz)3. A maximum PCE of 3.94% with a Jsc of 8.80 mA cm−2, FF of 46.42% and Voc of 0.97 V was obtained in the TPA(BT–3Cz)3-based cell. Our results indicated that the structures and the substituted positions of the planar carbazolyl unit at terminals play a significant role in improving the photovoltaic performance of its SMs in OSCs.
