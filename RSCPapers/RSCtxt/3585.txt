    , Accepted 25th January 2023First published on 30th January 2023AbstractA selenium substitution strategy combined with terminal modulation for developing high-efficiency non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) has drawn much attention in the field of organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, three novel NFAs featuring a benzoselenadiazole central core and IC terminal groups, namely BTSeIC-2Cl-γ, BTSeIC-2Cl-mix and BTSeIC-4Cl, were successfully designed and synthesized by modulating the numbers and positions of the chlorine atoms. Compared to the two counterpart NFAs bearing a single chlorinated γ-position and mixed positions (β or γ-position) on the IC group, di-chlorinated NFA BTSeIC-4Cl shows the strongest absorption, the shallowest lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level and the best molecular packing among the three acceptors. Consequently, the PM6: BTSeIC-4Cl based device exhibits a champion PCE of 16.14% with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 26.92 mA cm−2, which is mainly attributed to it having the most balanced and highest electron/hole mobility and optimal blend morphology. It is worth mentioning that the obtained JSC of the PM6: BTSeIC-4Cl device is among the highest values reported for selenium-heterocyclic fused-ring acceptors with chlorinated terminal groups in the OSCs. Furthermore, the acceptor BTSeIC-2Cl-γ with a defined molecular structure achieved a better PCE of 14.91% due to its higher charge mobility and stronger π–π interaction, whereas the acceptor BTSeIC-2Cl-mix exhibited a PCE of 14.21%. This work shows that combining the selenium-heterocyclic core with the halogen-substituted regulation of terminal groups is an effective way to produce high-performance NFAs.
Introduction
Solution-processable organic solar cells (OSCs), as one of the great potential solar energy conversion technologies, have attracted extensive attention owing to their outstanding advantages of being lightweight, low-cost and their convenient large-area fabrication.1–8 Compared with traditional fullerene-based derivatives, non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have recently been shown to have intrinsic advantages, such as easy regulation of energy levels and strong photon harvesting ranging from the broad visible to near-infrared (NIR) region.9–15 In particular, fused-ring acceptors (FRAs) featuring acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) and A–DA′D–A structures among the families of NFAs have made a significant breakthrough in the bottleneck of power conversion efficiency (PCE), with a PCE of over 19% reported for a single-junction device, driving the field of OSCs to a new stage.9,16–22 So far, the majority of FRAs reported in the literature have shown weak spectrum absorption covering the near-infrared (NIR) region from 800 to 1000 nm, resulting in a decreased utilization of capturing NIR region photons and usually relatively low short-circuit current densities (JSC) as well as PCEs.23–27 Accordingly, new strong photo-responsive FRAs for efficiently harvesting light photons in the NIR region should be urgently developed.
In general, cutting-edge FRAs are composed of an electron-donating fused-ring D or DA′D core and flanked with electron-withdrawing terminals, and a strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect between the central fused-ring core and terminal groups in the conjugated backbone is beneficial to broaden the optical absorption for harvesting photons and thereby enhancing the conversion of solar energy.28 In pursuing high-performance FRAs to capture more photons and improve the JSC, many skeleton-modulated strategies, including known core strategies for increasing the electron-donating capability of the core or known terminal group strategies for improving the stronger electron-deficient capability of terminal groups, have been used to increase the ICT interaction in the conjugated skeleton.29–32 Among these numerous known core strategies, a selenium heterocyclic substitution strategy achieved by incorporating more electron-rich selenium in the central or outermost position of the fused-ring core has been deemed to be an impactful way to increase the electron-donating strength of the molecular skeleton relative to that of the sulfur counterparts.16,33–37 For instance, Wang et al. adopted a selenium substitution strategy at the outermost position of a fused-ring core to synthesize the selenophene-fused acceptor S–WSeSe–Cl,38 which exhibited an obvious red-shifted absorption compared with that of sulfur analogs and showed a promising PCE of 16.01% and JSC of 26.35 mA cm−2. Recently, our group successfully developed a novel FRA BTSe-IC2F material with fluorinated terminal groups via selenium substitution at the central position of the fused-ring core,33 which showed a strong NIR response that extended to 980 nm and obtained a PCE of 17.3% with a JSC of 26.96 mA cm−2. Benefiting from the polarizability and non-covalent interactions of selenium, strengthened ICT interactions and well-aligned molecular packing can be attained. These encouraging achievements indicate the great potential of employing a selenium-substituted core strategy to develop novel NFAs.
With regard to terminal engineering, chlorinated terminal group regulation has been demonstrated to have a crucial impact on ICT interactions and intermolecular packing for enhancing photon-harvesting and down-shifting the molecular energy levels compared with fluorinated or brominated FRAs.39–42 Many research studies have proven that employing chlorination to down-shift energy levels is more effective in comparison with fluorination due to the empty 3D orbitals of chlorine atoms. In addition, the C–Cl bond exhibits the largest dipole moment among carbon-fluorinated or brominated bonds, providing an advantage in strengthening the ICT effect to improve the absorption spectrum and form intermolecular interactions.43 Moreover, it has been proven that the isomerization of the end groups with subtle structure variation leads to significant differences in molecular stacking, charge transport and photovoltaic performance.44 He et al. synthesized bromine-substituted FRA ITIC-2Br-γ with a fixed position of its end group and attained a higher PCE of 12.05% compared with a material with a mixture of two isomers.45 Given the above consideration, there is still room for improvement to further strengthen the ICT effect between an electron-rich fused-ring core and strong electron-withdrawing terminals with a certain structure for broadening photo-responses in the NIR region. This strategy thus may be a judicious choice to design highly-efficient OSCs.
Herein, three novel NFAs featuring a dithienothiophen[3,2-b]-pyrrolobenzoselenadiazole core bearing 2-butyloctyl side chains and IC terminal groups with varying numbers and positions of the chlorine atoms were successfully designed and synthesized, namely BTSeIC-2Cl-γ, BTSeIC-2Cl-mix and BTSeIC-4Cl. As expected, tetra-chlorinated BTSeIC-4Cl exhibited the broadest spectral absorption owning to the strengthened ICT effect and increased intermolecular interactions, leading to it exhibiting the optimal JSC value compared with di-chlorinated NFA-based devices. In addition, BTSeIC-4Cl shows the shortest π–π stacking distance due to it exhibiting the strongest π–π molecular packing and the best balanced charge mobilities (μh/μe = 1.12). Consequently, the PM6: BTSeIC-4Cl based device exhibits a champion PCE of 16.14% with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 26.92 mA cm−2. It is worth mentioning that the obtained JSC of the PM6: BTSeIC-4Cl device is among the highest values reported for selenium-heterocyclic FRAs with chlorinated terminal groups in OSCs. Furthermore, the NFA acceptor BTSeIC-2Cl-γ with a defined molecular structure shows higher and more balanced charge mobility, thereby attaining a better PCE of 14.91%, whereas the mixture of two isomers BTSeIC-2Cl-mix acceptor exhibits a PCE of 14.21%. This work shows that combining a selenium-heterocyclic core with halogen-substituted regulation of the terminal group is an effective way to produce high-performance NFAs.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes of the three novel NFAs BTSeIC-2Cl-γ, BTSeIC-2Cl-mix and BTSeIC-4Cl are shown in Scheme 1. The key intermediate 2 was prepared via a ring-closing Cadogan reaction using PPh3 as a catalyst in o-dichlorobenzene. Successive alkylation of the brominated 2-butyloctyl side chains in the presence of K2CO3 as a catalyst afforded compound 2 in isolated yields of 85%. The dialdehyde intermediate 3 was further fabricated in 80% yield via Vilsmeier–Haack formylation under the catalysis of LDA and DMF at 0 °C. Ultimately, a Knoevenagel condensation reaction between dialdehyde 4 and IC terminal groups with different numbers and positions of the chlorine atoms generated the three target novel NFAs BTSeIC-2Cl-γ, BTSeIC-2Cl-mix and BTSeIC-4Cl in isolated yields of 67%, 66% and 70%, respectively. Meanwhile, the detailed synthetic procedures of the three chlorinated NFAs and their corresponding structural characterization, including 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, are provided in the ESI.† Inspiringly, the three chlorinated NFAs show good solubility in common solvents for achieving high processability. The decomposition temperatures (Td) of BTSeIC-2Cl-γ, BTSeIC-2Cl-mix and BTSeIC-4Cl are 323 °C, 320 °C and 321 °C (Fig. S9, ESI†), respectively, which reveals their good thermal stability in organic photovoltaic devices.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of BTSeIC-2Cl-γ, BTSeIC-2Cl-mix and BTSeIC-4Cl in dilute chloroform solution and thin films states are shown in Fig. 1c and Fig. S10a (ESI†), and the relevant data are summarized in Table 1. The three acceptor materials were dissolved in chloroform solution and exhibited broad and strong absorption in the range of 480–820 nm, and their maximum absorption wavelengths are located at 743 nm for BTSeIC-2Cl-γ, 743 nm for BTSeIC-2Cl-mix and 752 nm for BTSeIC-4Cl, respectively. Obviously, BTSeIC-4Cl was shown to be significantly red-shifted (by approximately 10 nm) relative to BTSeIC-2Cl-γ and BTSeIC-2Cl-mix, which could be ascribed to it exhibiting the strongest ICT effect between the central BTSe fused ring and the di-chlorinated IC groups. In addition, the molar extinction coefficients of the three materials are almost identical due to the similar conjugation effects of the chlorinated IC terminals (1.66 × 105 M−1 cm−1, 1.65 × 105 M−1 cm−1, 1.67 × 105 M−1 cm−1). In thin films, all of these acceptors show greater red-shifted absorption than in chloroform solution (around 80–88 nm) with wider absorption over 530–950 nm, which is probably due to the stronger π–π stacking of the material in an aggregated state. Moreover, the red-shift of the maximum absorption wavelength position of BTSeIC-4Cl compared to BTSeIC-2Cl-γ and BTSeIC-2Cl-mix in the thin film state is reflected by the stronger ICT effect observed as the degree of chlorination increases. To our great pleasure, the currently most popular donor, PM6, has strong absorption in the 400–600 nm range, which exhibits suitable complementary absorption to the three chlorinated NFAs. Compared with the pure acceptor film, the absorption spectra of blend films with PM6 all show a slight blue shift (Fig. S10b, ESI†), which might be due to the better morphology of the blend films. The optical band gaps of BTSeIC-2Cl-γ, BTSeIC-2Cl-mix and BTSeIC-4Cl films calculated from the absorption edge are 1.34, 1.33, and 1.31 eV, respectively. It should be noted that the strongest NIR absorption of BTSeIC-4Cl among the three chlorinated NFAs contributes to boosting the photon-harvesting ability and thus attaining increased JSC values in the OSCs.

The electrochemical properties of PM6, BTSeIC-2Cl-γ, BTSeIC-2Cl-mix and BTSeIC-4Cl were calculated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), with the results shown in Fig. 1d and Fig. S11 (ESI†) and the relevant data summarized in Table 1. The highest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of the materials were calculated from the oxidation and reduction curves at −5.39/−3.28 eV for PM6, −5.48/−3.70 eV for BTSeIC-2Cl-γ, −5.47/−3.68 eV for BTSeIC-2Cl-mix and −5.51/−3.73 eV BTSeIC-4Cl. It is worth mentioning that the introduction of di-chlorinated IC groups in BTSeIC-4Cl led to stronger electron-withdrawing ability and decreased energy levels.46 In other words, the rise in the BTSeIC-2Cl-γ and BTSeIC-2Cl-mix LUMO energy levels resulted in a higher VOC for the device owing to the smaller energy offsets between single chlorinated NFAs/PM6 compared to BTSeIC-4Cl, which is consistent with the obtained J–V results. Contact angle tests for studying the surface tension to explore the miscibility between the three chlorinated NFAs and the polymer donor PM6 were conducted.47 The measured contact angle and calculated surface energy data (including the London dispersion (γd), polar (γp) component, and surface tension (γ) values) of the materials are summarized in Fig. S13 and Table S1 (ESI†). The surface tension values of the PM6, BTSeIC-2Cl-γ, BTSeIC-2Cl-mix and BTSeIC-4Cl thin films are 21.61, 26.18, 24.38 and 25.79 [mN−1], respectively. The Flory–Huggins interaction parameters (χ) of the donor–acceptor materials were calculated using the formula  with χPM6: BTSeIC-2Cl-γ = 0.22 K, χPM6: BTSeIC-2Cl-mix = 0.14 K, χPM6: BTSeIC-4Cl = 0.09 K, where the smaller χ value reflects that BTSeIC-4Cl exhibits better miscibility with PM6 in chloroform solution than BTSeIC-2Cl-γ and BTSeIC-2Cl-mix, which is helpful to obtain favorable blend morphology and may partly account for the well-balanced electron/hole mobility and FF of the BTSeIC-4Cl-based device.
To better understand the influence of the chlorination strategy on the frontier molecular orbitals, electrostatic potential (ESP) distributions, and dipole moments of NFAs based on a selenium heterocyclic core, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G level, in which the outer undecyl chains and the inner 2-butyloctyl chains were simplified as methyl groups. As shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. S12 (ESI†), BTSeIC-2Cl-γ, BTSeIC-2Cl-β and BTSeIC-4Cl exhibit high co-planarity molecular geometries and identical molecular frameworks to the Y6-series in spite of the larger atomic radius of selenium. The HOMO orbitals of the three NFAs are mainly distributed in the electron-rich fused-ring selenium heterocyclic core, whereas the LUMO orbitals are delocalized over the whole backbone. Their theoretical HOMO/LUMO values are −3.53/−5.59 for BTSeIC-2Cl-γ, −3.54/−5.56 for BTSeIC-2Cl-β and −3.64/−5.64 eV for BTSeIC-4Cl, respectively. The changing trend of the calculated HOMO/LUMO is in accordance with the electrochemical results. In addition, the downshifted molecular energy level of BTSeIC-4Cl is attributed to the greater electron-deficient capacity of the di-chlorinated groups. The ESPs and molecular dipoles of the three chlorinated NFAs are also shown in Fig. 2. The negative charge is mainly concentrated at the electron-deficient groups, and the positive polarity is located at the electron-rich groups. The NFA BTSeIC-2Cl-γ bearing a single chlorinated γ-position has a dipole moment of 1.03 Debye, while the counterpart NFA BTSeIC-2Cl-β with a single chlorinated β-position shows a larger value of 2.06 Debye due to the different position of the chlorine atom. However, the BTSeIC-2Cl-mix composed of BTSeIC-2Cl-γ and BTSeIC-2Cl-β exhibits an uncertain dipole moment. For comparison, the dipole moment of BTSeIC-4Cl increases up to 1.09 Debye owing to the chlorination-substituted regulation of the terminal group, which is helpful for stronger aggregation and stacking.

Photovoltaic properties
OSC devices were fabricated using positive structure ITO/PEDOT: PSS (4083)/PM6: acceptor/PDINO/Ag and their photovoltaic performance was investigated. The detailed method and optimized data of the corresponding devices are provided in the ESI.† The parameters of the donor: acceptor (D:A) blend weight ratios, dosages of additives and annealing temperature were systematically optimized to prepare OSCs under the best device fabrication conditions. The optimized conditions are a D:A weight ratio of 1:1.2, 0.5 vol% DIO as an additive and an annealing temperature of the active layer of 100 °C for 10 min. The optimized J–V curves are shown in Fig. 3a, where all three acceptor materials after being blended with PM6 were optimized to have the best efficiency, with VOC of 0.86 V, JSC of 23.72 mA cm−2, FF of 73.08% and PCE of 14.91% for BTSeIC-2Cl-γ, VOC of 0.85 V, JSC of 23.20 mA cm−2, FF of 71.91% and PCE of 14.21% for BTSeIC-2Cl-mix and VOC of 0.82 V, JSC of 26.92 mA cm−2, FF of 73.11% and the highest PCE of 16.14% for BTSeIC-4Cl. As we know, the obtained JSC of the PM6: BTSeIC-4Cl device is among the highest values reported for selenium-heterocyclic FRAs with chlorinated terminal groups in OSCs (Fig. 3c). It was evidently found that the VOC values of the three NFAs were improved with the addition of CN, while the corresponding JSC values were significantly increased with the addition of DIO, leading to higher PCEs during the optimization process. It is worth mentioning that the BTSeIC-4Cl-based devices were optimized to afford higher JSC and FF values than BTSeIC-2Cl-γ and BTSeIC-2Cl-mix, indicating that the BTSeIC-4Cl-based device exhibited better molecular stacking and charge transport.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) values of the optimized devices were tested and the results are shown in Fig. 3b, which explain the ultra-high JSC values of the BTSeIC-4Cl-based devices. As we can see, the devices based on the three acceptor materials all exhibited a high EQE plateau in the range of 420–850 nm; however, the maximum EQE of the BTSeIC-4Cl-based devices reached 86%, much greater than the 77% for BTSeIC-2Cl-γ-based devices and 76% for BTSeIC-2Cl-mix-based devices. Moreover, the BTSeIC-4Cl-based devices exhibited high photon responses ranging from 300 to 966 nm, which are also broader than the photon responses ranging from 300 to 952 nm and 300 to 950 nm for the BTSeIC-2Cl-γ and BTSeIC-2Cl-mix devices, respectively. The integrated JSC values of the devices based on BTSeIC-2Cl-γ, BTSeIC-2Cl-mix and BTSeIC-4Cl from EQE spectra are 23.12 mA cm−2, 22.62 mA cm−2 and 26.03 mA cm−2, respectively, and the mismatches are all within 4%, which are in agreement with the JSC values from the J–V curve. Excitingly, the EQE plateau of the BTSeIC-4Cl-based devices still reached 55% at 900 nm, verifying that the BTSeIC-4Cl-based devices exhibit higher JSC values compared to the other two acceptor materials. In addition, we also tested the long-term stability of the devices and the results showed that the PCEs of the devices remained above 90% after 400 h, showing the outstanding stability of the devices (Fig. S16, ESI†).
To investigate the charge generation and collection efficiencies of the corresponding devices, we measured and calculated the relationship between the photocurrent density (Jph = JL − JD) and effective voltage (Veff = V0 − Va), wherein JL and JD are defined as the photocurrent densities under AM 1.5 G illumination and in the dark, respectively, V0 is the voltage when Jph is zero and Va is the externally applied voltage. Notably, the magnitude of Veff alters the dissociation and collection process of excitons by affecting the electric field in the devices. In addition, under short-circuit conditions the exciton dissociation efficiency (ηdiss) should follow the equation ηdiss = JSC/Jsat, and the value of the charge collection efficiency (ηcoll) is the ratio of the current density (Jmax) to Jsat at maximum power, wherein Jsat is defined as the saturated current density.48 According to Fig. 3d, the ηdiss values of the BTSeIC-2Cl-γ-, BTSeIC-2Cl-mix- and BTSeIC-4Cl-based devices are 97%, 95% and 96%, and the ηcoll values are 85%, 81% and 86%, respectively. As expected, the highest ηdiss and ηcoll values of the BTSeIC-4Cl-based devices suggest that they exhibit the most effective exciton dissociation and charge collection, which also led to them exhibiting the highest JSC values.
In order to explore the charge extraction and charge recombination process of OSCs based on the three receptors, the dependence of JSC and VOC on different light intensities (Plight) was also tested. Theoretically, the JSC value is proportional to Pαlight under short-circuit conditions, where α represents the degree of the bimolecular recombination and the ideal value of α equals 1. However, the experimental value is always less than and close to 1, so the bimolecular recombination is more inhibited.49,50 In addition, the relationship between VOC and Plight can be defined as VOC ∝ n(KT/q)ln(P), where n, K, T and q represent the ideality factor, temperature (K), Boltzmann constant and the elementary charge, respectively.51 On the one hand, a value of n closer to 1 means that trap-assisted recombination is low and bimolecular recombination is dominant; on the other hand, n equals to 2 means that trap-assisted recombination is dominant in the devices.52 As shown in Fig. 3e, the α values of the BTSeIC-2Cl-γ-, BTSeIC-2Cl-mix- and BTSeIC-4Cl-based devices are 0.9898, 0.9895 and 0.9902, respectively, which suggest that bimolecular recombination was more strongly inhibited in the BTSeIC-4Cl-based devices. In addition, the n values of the BTSeIC-2Cl-γ-, BTSeIC-2Cl-mix- and BTSeIC-4Cl-based devices are 1.14, 1.24 and 1.09, as shown in Fig. 3f, respectively, which indicates that the BTSeIC-2Cl-γ- and BTSeIC-2Cl-mix-based devices exhibit more charge recombination, which directly leads to low carrier extraction efficiency, which is also the reason for the BTSeIC-4Cl-based devices exhibiting the highest FF values.
The hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities of the three active layer films were characterized using the space charge confined current (SCLC) method, employing the structures (ITO/PEDOT: PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag) and (ITO/ZnO/active layer/PDINO/Ag), respectively (Fig. S15, ESI† and Table 2). The μh and μe values of the PM6: BTSeIC-2Cl-γ and PM6: BTSeIC-2Cl-mix blend films were calculated to be 4.23 × 10−4/2.02 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.48 × 10−4/1.86 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, with the ratios of 2.09 and 2.41, respectively. In contrast, the μh and μe values of the PM6: BTSeIC-4Cl blend films were increased to 5.35 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.77 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, with an outstanding μh/μe ratio of 1.12. The obtained results indicate that a higher and more well-balanced hole/electron mobility resulted in the high JSC and FF values of the BTSeIC-4Cl-based devices.53

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to gain a deeper understanding of the great differences in photovoltaic properties that arose due to surface topography. According to the height and phase AFM images (Fig. 4), the root mean square (RMS) roughness values of the PM6: BTSeIC-2Cl-γ, PM6: BTSeIC-2Cl-mix and PM6: BTSeIC-4Cl blend films were 1.35 nm, 1.43 nm, and 1.53 nm, respectively. The low roughness values also exhibit the great compatibility between our acceptor materials and PM6, which is consistent with the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (χ) results. In contrast, the higher roughness value of the PM6: BTSeIC-4Cl blend film is probably due to the stronger aggregation properties after optimization leading to more ordered and intense molecular packing. In addition, obvious phase separation morphology was conducive to improving the efficiency of exciton dissociation.54

The intermolecular packing of the PM6: BTSeIC-2Cl-γ, PM6: BTSeIC-2Cl-mix and PM6: BTSeIC-4Cl blend films was further studied by conducting GIWAXS tests (Fig. 5). The PM6: BTSeIC-2Cl-γ blend film exhibited IP (100) lamellar scattering at qxy = 0.298 Å−1 (d = 21.08 Å) and a π–π stacking (010) peak at qz = 1.74 Å−1 (d = 3.61 Å) along the out-of-plane (OOP) direction. The PM6: BTSeIC-2Cl-mix film showed a lamellar peak at qxy = 0.296 Å−1 (d = 21.21 Å) along the in-plane (IP) direction and the π–π stacking (010) peak at qz = 1.730 Å−1 (d = 3.63 Å) along the OOP direction. The PM6: BTSeIC-4Cl film displayed a lamellar peak at qxy = 0.309 Å−1 (d = 20.32 Å) in the IP direction, and a π–π peak at qz = 1.76 Å−1 (d = 3.56 Å) in the OOP direction. It is obvious that the di-chlorinated NFA BTSeIC-4Cl shows the strongest molecular packing among the three chlorinated NFAs and BTSeIC-2Cl-γ with a defined molecular structure shows stronger molecular packing relative to BTSeIC-2Cl-mix. In addition, the PM6: BTSeIC-4Cl film is preferable to the obvious face-on orientation stacking according to the GIWAXS results, which is beneficial to charge transport along the vertical direction, leading to better JSC and FF values. To quantitatively study the ordered crystalline packing, the crystalline coherence length (CCL) of the π–π peak was investigated using the equation: CCL = 1.8π/fwhm, in which fwhm refers to the full width at half-maximum of the peak. CCL values of the OOP π–π peaks for PM6: BTSeIC-2Cl-γ, PM6: BTSeIC-2Cl-mix and PM6: BTSeIC-4Cl blend films were 22.1 Å, 22.3 Å, and 23.9 Å, respectively. This result shows that the introduction of the stronger electron-withdrawing di-chlorinated terminals for BTSeIC-4Cl improve the intermolecular interaction and promote intermolecular packing, in good agreement with the SCLC mobility and AFM imaging results.33

Conclusion
In summary, three chlorinated NFAs based on a selenium heterocyclic core, namely BTSeIC-2Cl-γ, BTSeIC-2Cl-mix and BTSeIC-4Cl, were successfully synthesized by precisely regulating the number and position of the end-group chlorine atoms. The stronger di-chlorination of BTSeIC-4Cl due to the strengthened ICT effect led to a wider NIR absorption edge relative to two-single-chlorinated counterpart NFAs. In addition, the PM6: BTSeIC-4Cl blend film exhibited compact molecular stacking and preferential face-on orientation compared to that of BTSeIC-2Cl-γ and BTSeIC-2Cl-mix. The BTSeIC-4Cl-based devices achieved a VOC of 0.82 V, JSC of 26.92 mA cm−2, FF of 73.11% and a champion PCE of 16.14%. It is worth mentioning that the JSC value of 26.92 mA cm−2 is among the highest values reported for selenium-heterocyclic FRAs with chlorinated terminal groups in OSCs. Furthermore, the NFA acceptor BTSeIC-2Cl-γ with a defined molecular structure achieved a better PCE of 14.91%, whereas the mixture of two isomers acceptor, BTSeIC-2Cl-mix, exhibited a PCE of 14.21%. The PM6: BTSeIC-4Cl blend film displayed not only a broader NIR photo-response region and well-balanced hole/electron mobility but also more beneficial stacking morphology, resulting in simultaneous enhancements in the JSC and FF values compared with those of BTSeIC-2Cl-γ and BTSeIC-2Cl-mix. This work informs us that combining the selenium-heterocyclic core with the halogen-substituted regulation of the terminal group is an effective approach by which to obtain high-efficiency NIR-absorbing FRAs.
