    , Accepted 2nd January 2019First published on 4th January 2019AbstractHow to enhance the light absorption of the photoactive layer with a limited thickness is still a big challenge. To take advantage of the plasmonic effects of sharp-edged metal nanoparticles and the excellent electron collection ability of ZnO in polymer solar cells (PSCs), we designed and synthesized multifunctional bipyramid-Au@ZnO core–shell nanoparticles (Au@ZnO). These materials were integrated into inverted non-fullerene PSCs with a limited photoactive layer thickness. We conducted electron mobility, dissociation probability, and time-resolved photoluminescence testing. Our results were supported by the theoretical prediction that the Au@ZnO is capable of boosting the near-infrared photo-response and effectively extracting the electrons from the photoactive layer. These features markedly improved carrier transport and enabled fast charge transfer to the electrode. Promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) values of 10.88% and 13.67% were achieved for the PBDTBDD:ITIC and PBDB-TF:IT-4F-based PSCs with a Au@ZnO cathode buffer layer (CBL). This performance was superior to that of reference devices without a Au@ZnO CBL, which showed PCEs of only 9.09% and 11.86%, respectively. Our findings suggest great potential for the design of a multifunctional CBL with good electron extraction and plasmonic properties for high performance PSCs.
1. Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great interest in recent years owing to the scope for a wide range of chemical modifications, solution-processability, low-cost and potential for mass production.1–4 Efforts have thus far focused on exploring innovative electrode buffer layers,5–9 strong light harvesting organic materials,10–12 and novel structures to gain efficient and stable PSCs.13–16 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has reached up to 17%.15,17–19 Despite these improvements in device performance, a huge potential efficiency enhancement might be achieved in these devices, if the trade-off between photon absorption and carrier collection can be rebalanced. The optimum active layer thickness of fullerene-free PSCs is typically approximately 100 nm owing to the low charge-carrier mobility and short exciton diffusion length of most molecular and polymeric materials.20 This thickness is much thinner than the desired theoretical thickness to completely absorb all incident sunlight. Effectively enhancing light absorption within the limited thickness of the photoactive layer might lead to considerable performance gains.
Plasmonic effects arise from coherent oscillations of noble-metal nanostructures near their surfaces. These effects can change the optical response of materials by electromagnetic coupling to the local surface plasmon resonance of individual nanostructures. This behavior depends strongly on the shape and size of nanostructures.21,22 The optical response can be adjusted by two main approaches. The first is the strong local electromagnetic field (LEF) generated by the incident light coupling to surface plasmons,23–25 and the second is the extreme sensitivity of the optical response to the dielectric properties and refractive index of metals and their surrounding medium, which can modulate the plasmonic resonance and their associated extinction features.26
Recently, many investigations of PSCs have verified the feasibility of using metal plasmonic nanoparticles (MPNPs) to enhance light harvesting.27–29 We have also introduced decahedron-shaped Au nanoparticles into GaAs-based multi-junction photovoltaic devices and polymer solar cells to improve currents.25,30 These results have demonstrated that decahedron-shaped Au MPNPs with sharp vertexes and edges show great promise for addressing the trade-off between light absorption and carrier collection. However, naked MPNPs (such as Au and Ag) also serve as recombination centers because they are good conductors and might easily corrode when in contact with liquid electrolytes, harming the device stability and deteriorating the device performance. Considering these factors, there is a great demand for novel multifunctional structures to address the above-mentioned barriers and realize efficient PSCs.
Herein, we first design and fabricate bipyramid-Au@ZnO core–shell nanoparticles (Au@ZnO) to serve as a cathode buffer layer (CBL) in PSCs. The Au@ZnO provides the following unique features. First, the use of the semiconductor ZnO instead of corrosive and hygroscopic poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)31 to coat Au nanoparticles avoids corrosion by the liquid electrolyte and also suppresses charge recombination during the charge transfer process. Second, we apply plasmonic gold-nanobipyramids with sharp vertexes and edges to improve the harvesting of incident sunlight. Furthermore, the combination of the gold-nanobipyramid core and ZnO shell structure can expand the range of the LEF and change the associated extinction features of the nanoparticles, leading to a remarkable absorption enhancement in the near-infrared band. By engineering the fabrication processes, selecting the electron donor and acceptor pairs, and coupling the Au@ZnO, we achieve promising PCEs of 10.88% and 13.67% for inverted PSCs based on PBDTBDD:ITIC and PBDB-TF:IT-4F, respectively. These performances were much higher than those of reference devices with the PBDTBDD:ITIC (9.09%) and PBDB-TF:IT-4F (11.86%) active layers and ZnO CBL.
2. Results and discussion
High-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of naked Au-nanobipyramid particles and Au@ZnO are shown in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. The Au-nanobipyramid particles show well-defined vertexes and edges, and their shape and size distribution were uniform (Fig. 1a). After coating the ZnO shell, well-formed Au@ZnO were obtained, and the Au core and ZnO shell in nanoparticles exhibited different image contrasts (Fig. 1b), confirming the presence of different materials. Here, we emphasize that the thickness of the ZnO shell should be controlled to achieve a perfect coating, neither too thick nor too thin. A thick film will weaken the intensity of the LEF.

To further confirm the element distributions in the core and shell, we performed energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping to determine the elemental composition. The EDS images of Au@ZnO are shown in Fig. 1c–e, and the green, blue and red dots represent Zn, O, and Au, respectively. These images confirm the existence and distribution of Au, Zn, and O elements in Au@ZnO. The Au was embedded in the center of each nanoparticle, whereas Zn and O elements were distributed outside the Au core. These results agreed with the TEM results shown in Fig. 1b.
To further characterize the morphology of the Au@ZnO, a dilute solution was spin-coated on ITO glass substrates and examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM), as shown in Fig. 1f and g. Tapping mode AFM topography images with a 5 μm × 5 μm scanning size showed ellipsoidal shaped nanoparticles sparsely distributed on the ITO-coated glass substrate. The root mean square (RMS) roughness was 35.7 nm. The morphology and phase images of the optimized and compact Au@ZnO layer are shown in Fig. 1h and i, respectively. This layer acts as a CBL in PSCs. The AFM topography and phase images of ZnO, Au@ZnO, PBDB-TF:IT-4F, ZnO/PBDB-TF:IT-4F, and Au@ZnO/PBDB-TF:IT-4F films on glass substrates are shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI,† and their RMS values were 5.94, 12.25, 3.44, 3.71, and 5.61 nm, respectively. Clearly, the RMS value of the Au@ZnO film was greater than that of the ZnO film, which increased the contact area and interfacial adhesion. These effects should decrease the series resistance and thus improve the charge collection ratio.
A unique feature of the noble-metal nanostructures is the plasmonic effects arising from coherent oscillations near the surface. The strong LEF induced by plasmonic excitations can be characterized by the frequency-dependent local-field factor , where γ is the position vector, Eloc(ω,γ) is the LEF at frequency ω, and E0(ω) is the incident field.32 The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) based on solutions of Maxwell's equations is an effective method to simulate the local field distribution and further determine the operating mechanism of nanoparticles based on the optical absorption enhancement of PSCs. In this model, the incident plane wave within the 300–900 nm band perpendicularly irradiates the devices and the incident field intensity E0(ω) is set to be 1 V m−1. The dispersion of the dielectric constants of ZnO and Au were taken from previous reports.33,34 The electric-field-intensity enhancement profiles of the naked Au-nanobipyramid and Au@ZnO along the transverse direction and the longitudinal direction are shown in Fig. 2. The edge length of the transverse direction (xy cross section) of the Au-nanobipyramid (a pentagon) was 15 nm, as shown in Fig. 2a. The height of the longitudinal direction (xz cross section) of the Au-nanobipyramid (a rhombus) was 80 nm, as shown in Fig. 2b. The lengths of the three principal axes Fig. 2a, b and c for the ellipsoidal Au@ZnO were 150, 150, and 180 nm as demonstrated in Fig. 1c and d. The purpose of this particular shape and size is to realize a uniformly coated microstructure and maximize light harvesting.

Introduction of the ZnO shell altered the LEF, and we observed a visible change of the local field distribution. The area of field enhancement of the Au@ZnO (Fig. 2c and d) expanded considerably compared with that of naked Au nanoparticles (Fig. 2a and b), although the highest field intensity slightly decreased because of changes in the surrounding dielectric environment. A larger area near-field intensity enhancement suggests a strong light absorption, which might thus boost device photocurrents. Furthermore, hot spots of field enhancement can be observed near the sharp vertices and corners of the Au-nanobipyramid owing to more energetic oscillations of free electrons, similar to our previous reports. Therefore, two features, namely the larger region of near-field intensity enhancement and the stronger field enhancement, facilitate light harvesting and increase the photocurrent of PSCs.
To verify the feasibility of Au@ZnO operating as both plasmon centers and electron extraction layers, we fabricated inverted PSCs with Au@ZnO. To determine the function of the Au@ZnO layer, we also fabricated control devices with the ZnO CBL. The thickness of the photoactive layers was approximately 100 nm for all devices. The conjugated polymers PBDTBDD and PBDT-TF were used as electron donor materials, and the fullerene-free small molecule compounds ITIC and IT-4F were applied as electron acceptor materials. Their molecular structures are shown in Fig. 3a. The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of pure PBDTBDD, PBDT-TF, ITIC, and IT-4F films are shown in Fig. 3b. The donor and acceptor materials exhibit complementary absorption spectra. The standard AM1.5 solar spectrum over wavelengths of 300–1100 nm and the extinction spectra of Au spheres, Au ellipsoids, Au decahedra, Au-nanobipyramids, and Au@ZnO showed extinction peaks at 497, 520, 545, 624, and 744 nm, respectively (Fig. 3c). The dipole extinction peak of Au@ZnO was red shifted to 744 nm and the quadrupole resonance peak appeared at 520 nm, which we attribute to retardation effects occurring at the Au@ZnO because of their relatively large size.32 Additionally, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) clearly broadened (in the range from 710 to 798 nm) owing to dipole–dipole interactions, suggesting a notable absorption enhancement within this spectral range.35 The absorption spectra of the ZnO film are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). We designed and fabricated inverted PSCs with a sandwich structure of ITO/Au@ZnO/PBDTBDD:ITIC or PBDB-TF:IT-4F/MoO3/Al, as shown in Fig. 3d. The schematic energy-level diagram of the materials involved in the PSCs is shown in Fig. 3e. The energy levels of active layer materials are taken from the literature.7,36,37 To investigate the work function changes between ZnO and Au@ZnO, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was performed, as shown in Fig. S3.† The work functions (WFs) of ZnO and Au@ZnO films were obtained using the equation WF = 21.22 − Ecutoff.38 The WFs of ZnO and Au@ZnO were estimated to be 4.46 eV and 4.31 eV, respectively, which are lower than the HOMO level of the ITIC (−5.48 eV) and IT-4F (−5.58 eV); therefore, electrons can easily transport to the ITO electrode through ZnO and Au@ZnO. As can be observed, the WF of Au@ZnO is slightly higher than that of ZnO, so there may be a small energy barrier for the ohmic contact formed between the Au@ZnO CBL and the active layer.

The concentration of the Au@ZnO solution was finely tuned from 2.5 to 4.5 mg mL−1 to determine the optimized thickness of the CBL. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of PSCs based on PBDTBDD:ITIC with Au@ZnO layers of different thicknesses are shown in Fig. S4,† and the device parameters (averaged over 15 individual devices) are summarized in Table S1†. The thicknesses of the Au@ZnO layer with the concentrations of 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4 and 4.5 mg mL−1 are around 20, 24, 30, 43 and 51 nm, respectively. As the concentration of the Au@ZnO solution increased from 2.5 to 4.5 mg mL−1, with the increase of the thickness of Au@ZnO CBL, the Voc decreased from 0.89 to 0.87, and the Jsc showed a trend of rising from 15.69 to 18.86 mA cm−2 and then falling from 18.86 to 17.46 mA cm−2. And we found that both the Jsc (18.86 mA cm−2) and PCE (10.88%) reached a maximum at 4.0 mg mL−1, which should be a suitable concentration of Au@ZnO for achieving high performance PSCs.

Fig. 4 shows the J–V curves and EQE spectra of the evaluated devices with the optimized Au@ZnO CBL and control devices with the ZnO CBL. The photovoltaic performance parameters under AM 1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 are compared in Table 1. Note that the parameters are averaged over 15 devices. From the J–V curves of the inverted PSCs based on the PBDTBDD:ITIC-photosensitive layer (Fig. 4a), a PCE of 9.09%, a Voc of 0.90 V, a Jsc of 15.10 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 66.91% were achieved with the use of ZnO as the CBL. By replacing ZnO with Au@ZnO, the Jsc of the devices with the Au@ZnO layer greatly improved from 15.10 to 18.86 mA cm−2, whereas the Voc and FF remained similar, leading to an enhanced PCE of 10.88%. This 19.70% relative efficiency enhancement shows that Au@ZnO can be used as both an electron extraction layer and a plasmonic center to realize effective carrier collection and induce stronger optical response of active blends.

To confirm that the enhancement of Jsc originated from improved light harvesting, the corresponding EQE curves are shown in Fig. 4b. As expected, the EQE curves clearly show an increased input photon to converted current efficiency performance over the wavelength range from 300 to 800 nm for devices with the Au@ZnO CBL. The integrated current densities were 14.95 and 18.69 mA cm−2 for PSCs with ZnO and Au@ZnO CBLs, respectively, which is in good agreement with the Jsc values derived from the J–V curves. The green dashed line in Fig. 4b represents the relative enhancement of EQE (ΔEQE). The devices with the Au@ZnO CBL had a higher photo-response covering a broad range from 550 to 770 nm owing to the plasmonic effects of the Au@ZnO and the associated extinction properties. The subtly higher EQE at other wavelengths might be attributed to the improved charge transport and collection ability of the Au@ZnO CBL.
We also fabricated inverted devices based on a PBDB-TF:IT-4F photoactive layer to further confirm that the Au@ZnO improved the device performance. As shown by the J–V curves in Fig. 4c, the devices with the ZnO buffer layer showed a PCE of 11.87% with a Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 18.84 mA cm−2, and a FF of 73.21%. The same trend was observed after the replacement of ZnO with the Au@ZnO layer. The Jsc of the PSCs with the Au@ZnO CBL remarkably improved from 18.84 to 22.37 mA cm−2, which in turn increased the PCE to 13.67%. The EQE spectra of the devices with the Au@ZnO CBL in Fig. 4d showed a more sensitive photo-response in the long waveband of 550–800 nm, and the integrated current densities were 18.61 and 22.29 mA cm−2 for the ZnO and Au@ZnO CBLs, respectively. Moreover, for devices with the Au@ZnO CBL, the EQE surpassed 80% within the wavelength range from 520 to 760 nm. This performance was much higher than that of devices with the ZnO CBL, owing to the plasmonic effect of Au@ZnO and improved charge transport. These results are in good agreement with our FDTD calculations shown in Fig. 2 and 3d.
To better understand the charge transport function of the Au@ZnO CBL, we fabricated single-electron devices with the structures ITO/Al/ZnO/Al and ITO/Al/Au@ZnO/Al39 and measured their J–V curves (Fig. 5a). The electron mobility of the Au@ZnO layer was 8.56 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was much higher than that of ZnO (1.16 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1); hence, the former likely enhanced charge transportation of the Au@ZnO based PSCs. The possibility of dissociation (Pdiss) is explored to elucidate the plasmonic function of the Au@ZnO layer. The factor Pdiss can be expressed as Pdiss = Jsc/Jsat × 100%, where Jsat is the saturation photocurrent density.40,41 Neglecting the series resistance of the photovoltaic system, the measured photocurrent is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the measured light and dark current densities, respectively. The effective voltage is expressed as Veff = Vo − Va, where Vo is the voltage at Jph = 0 and Va is the applied voltage. Fig. 5b shows the Jph–Veff curves for reference devices and plasmonic devices, biased from 1 to −8 V under illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The Jph increased linearly with Veff at a low bias and then saturated (Jsat) at a high bias. For devices based on PBDTBDD:ITIC with ZnO and Au@ZnO CBLs, the Pdiss values were 88.5% and 91.8% with Jsat values of 16.3 and 20.27 mA cm−2, respectively. For devices based on PBDB-TF:IT-4F with ZnO and Au@ZnO CBLs, the Pdiss values were 90.1% and 92.1% with Jsat values of 18.6 and 22.98 mA cm−2, respectively. The increased Pdiss for devices with the Au@ZnO CBL suggested that the enhanced exciton generation and dissociation can be attributed to the LSPR effect of Au@ZnO, which improves the light utilization of active layers.42

(e) Jsc and (f) Voc as a function of light intensity for PBDB-TF:IT-4F PSCs with the ZnO or Au@ZnO CBL. 
Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were conducted to evaluate the carrier collection function of Au@ZnO. Two sets of samples, solid thin films of PBDTBDD:ITIC, ZnO/PBDTBDD:ITIC, and Au@ZnO/PBDTBDD:ITIC and PBDB-TF:IT-4F, ZnO/PBDB-TF:IT-4F, and Au@ZnO/PBDB-TF:IT-4F spin-coated on a quartz glass substrate, were investigated at an excitation wavelength of 750 nm (Fig. 5c and d). The TRPL curves were fitted with a bi-exponential function. The TRPL is considered to be the summation of the short lifetime (τ1) and the long lifetime (τ2), which correspond to fast decay processes related to trap-assisted recombination and slow decay processes related to radiative recombination, respectively.43–45 The parameters of TRPL results for different solid films are summarized in Table S2.† The average lifetimes of the PBDTBDD:ITIC and PBDTB-TF:IT-4F films were 9.26 and 8.29 ns, respectively, indicating that there is efficient charge transfer in both blend films. When inserting ZnO or Au@ZnO, we observed different decreases of the average lifetime. The average lifetimes for PBDTBDD:ITIC and PBDTB-TF:IT-4F with a ZnO layer were 5.70 and 6.78 ns, respectively; conversely, the average lifetimes were only 3.52 and 2.15 ns with the Au@ZnO layer. These latter values are much lower than those of the active layers with and without ZnO thin films, which clearly indicates that Au@ZnO can be used as an electron extraction layer and a plasmonic center. This combination of effects facilitates carrier transportation, boosts light harvesting in the active layer, and induces fast charge transfer to the electrode, leading to a considerable improvement in the photocurrent and efficiency enhancement of our polymer solar cells.
To figure out the effect of Au@ZnO on the recombination in PBDB-TF:IT-4F PSCs, we measured the dependence of Jsc and Voc on the light intensity (Plight), giving the relationships of Jsc ∝ Plightα and .46,47 Under short-circuit conditions, the PSC with the Au@ZnO CBL shows a slightly increased value (0.978) closer to unity compared to that (0.963) of the PSC with the ZnO CBL, as shown in Fig. 5e. This result indicates that almost all free carriers in the PSC with the Au@ZnO CBL are swept out and collected at the electrodes before bimolecular recombination owing to the dual function of Au@ZnO, which consequently contributed to an improvement of Jsc. On the other hand, under open-circuit conditions, all free carriers would recombine. If bimolecular recombination dominates, the slope of Vocversus light intensity is equal to 1kT/q. Nevertheless, both the PSCs with ZnO and Au@ZnO CBLs demonstrated obviously deviated slopes from 1kT/q, as shown in Fig. 5f. This suggests that additional Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination has occurred. Therefore, the smaller slope (n = 1.45) of the PSC with the Au@ZnO CBL suggests reduced SRH recombination than the PSC with the ZnO CBL.
3. Conclusion
In conclusion, we fabricated multifunctional Au@ZnO and integrated it into inverted non-fullerene PSCs. Our FDTD numerical simulations of the LEF and associated extinction properties of Au@ZnO predicted the advantages of electron extraction by ZnO and the plasmonic effects of Au in PSCs. Our experimental results, supported by theory, confirm that Au@ZnO can improve the near-infrared photo-response of PSCs through plasmonic effects. We achieved promising PCEs of 10.88% and 13.67% for PBDTBDD:ITIC and PBDB-TF:IT-4F PSCs with the Au@ZnO CBL, which were superior to the performance of reference devices with PBDTBDD:ITIC (9.09%) and PBDB-TF:IT-4F (11.86%). The electron mobility, dissociation probability, TRPL and Plight testing was conducted to further elucidate the outstanding features of the Au@ZnO CBL from the standpoint of carrier transportation and collection. These results indicate that efficient PSCs can be achieved by introducing Au@ZnO with the merits of the ZnO CBL and Au plasmonic effects.
4. Experimental section
Materials
Patterned ITO glass with a sheet resistance of 10 Ω sq−1 was purchased from CSG Holding Co., Ltd (China). PBDTBDD and ITIC were provided by Solarmer Materials (Beijing) Inc. PBDB-TF and IT-4F were provided by the State Key Laboratory of Polymer Physics and Chemistry, Institute of Chemistry, CAS. 1,8-Diiodooctane (DIO) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. All materials were commercially available products and used directly without further purification.
Bipyramid-Au@ZnO synthesis
To grow Au@ZnO, the first step is to prepare Au bipyramids via previously reported seed-mediated growth.48 (I) Synthesis of seeds: hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC), citric acid and HAuCl4 were successively introduced into a 20 mL flask containing 10 mL of water. The final concentrations of CTAC, citric acid and HAuCl4 were 50, 5, and 0.25 mM, respectively. Freshly prepared ice-cold NaBH4 (0.25 mL, 25 mM) was rapidly added under vigorous stirring at room temperature. The solution changed from yellow to brown owing to the formation of ultrafine Au nanoparticles. After 2 min of stirring, the flask was sealed and the solution containing Au nanoparticles was aged in an 80 °C oil bath. Notably, gentle stirring was needed during the aging. The color changed again from brown to red as the particle diameter increased. After aging for 90 min, the seed solution was cooled down to room temperature for growth of Au bipyramids. (II) Synthesis of Au bipyramids: hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (100 mL, 100 mM), HAuCl4 (5 mL, 10 mM), AgNO3 (1 mL, 10 mM), ascorbic acid (0.8 mL, 100 mM), and HCl (2 mL, 1 M) were mixed to produce a growth solution. A 2.5 mL portion of the seed solution was injected into the above growth solution under vigorous stirring. After 2 min, the solution was maintained at 30 °C for 2 h without disturbance. The resulting colloid containing Au bipyramids was used directly for growth of a ZnO shell without purification.
The preparation of Au@ZnO was based on a reported method.49 A 5 mL portion of the Au bipyramid colloid, Zn(NO3)2, and hexamethylenetetramine were added to 20 mL of water (the final molar ratio of Au, Zn2+ and hexamethylenetetramine was 1:30:30). The solution was sealed and then heated in an 85 °C oven. After 8 h, the colloid was cooled to room temperature and then centrifuged (8000 rpm). The supernatant was discarded and the precipitate (Au@ZnO) was collected. To purify the Au@ZnO, the precipitate was re-dispersed in 10 mL of water and collected again using a centrifuge. This treatment was repeated three times and the final products were dissolved in 10 mL of water.
Device fabrication
The device architecture was ITO/ZnO or Au@ZnO/PBDBDD:ITIC or PBDB-TF:IT-4F/MoO3/Al. The ITO-coated glass substrates were sequentially pre-cleaned with detergent, water, ultrapure water, and isopropyl alcohol in an ultrasonic bath for 15 min each. The Au@ZnO CBL was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s onto the ITO substrates after a 15 min UV-ozone treatment. The spun films were then baked at 145 °C for 12 min in air. For control devices, the ZnO CBL was spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 30 s and then baked at 150 °C for 10 min in air. Subsequently, PBDTBDD:ITIC or PBDB-TF:IT-4F (1:1 weight ratio) in 10 mg mL−1 chlorobenzene:DIO (99.5:0.5 volume ratio, stirred for 30 min before spin-coating) solution was spin-coated to obtain a film thickness of ≈100 nm. The as-spun film was annealed at 100 °C for 10 min in a nitrogen-protected glove box. Finally, a 10 nm-thick MoO3 hole buffer layer and a 100 nm-thick Al cathode were deposited under a pressure of 1 × 10−4 Pa in a vacuum evaporator. The photoactive area of the device was approximately 4 mm2.
Device characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of PSCs were measured with a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit (SMU) under simulated AM1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 using a xenon-lamp-based solar simulator (AAA grade, San-Ei Electric Co., Ltd) in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured in air using a Systems model QE-DLI lock-in amplifier coupled with a QE-M110 monochromatic 75 W xenon lamp (Enli Technology Co., Ltd.). The light intensity was calibrated against a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell.
Instrumentation
A Lambda 950 UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer was used to determine the optical absorption spectra of the active layer materials and the Au@ZnO based thin films. The thickness of the active layer was measured with a Dektak XT surface profilometer (Bruker). The surface morphologies of the solid thin films were analyzed with an Agilent 5500 atomic force microscope (AFM) operated in tapping mode under the ambient atmosphere at room temperature. The TRPL spectra of the solid thin films were obtained from Edinburgh Instruments Ltd. Steady/transient state fluorescence spectra (F900) were measured at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm.
