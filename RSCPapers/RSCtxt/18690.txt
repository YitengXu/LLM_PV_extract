    , Accepted 3rd October 2022First published on 3rd October 2022AbstractThe concurrent photocatalytic synthesis of hydrogen gas and high-valued chemicals over two-dimensional semiconductors is extremely attractive to alleviate global energy and environmental concerns through directly using sunlight. Herein, a novel layered In4/3P2Se6 nanosheet is synthesized by a space confined chemical vapor conversion method, and it acts as a dual-functional photocatalyst to deliver the co-production of hydrogen gas and N-benzylidenebenzylamine from water reduction and selective benzylamine oxidation. The simultaneous yield of hydrogen gas and N-benzylidenebenzylamine is 895 μmol g−1 and 681 μmol g−1, respectively, within 16-hour continuous reaction involving a small amount of water in acetonitrile solvent. Moreover, 97.4% N-benzylidenebenzylamine selectivity from benzylamine oxidation can be achieved with continuous 10 hour-reaction only in acetonitrile solvent under ambient conditions. Further in situ electron paramagnetic resonance measurements and reaction optimization tests reveal that the reaction mechanism strongly relies on the conditions over the In4/3P2Se6 nanosheet photocatalyst.
Introduction
The photocatalytic synthesis of high valued chemicals is expected to be a promising approach to alleviate the global energy crisis and resource shortage.1–4 The co-production of hydrogen gas and organic transformation represent a promising avenue to efficiently utilize solar light for chemicals and clean fuels. In particular, N-benzylidenebenzylamine (N-BD) is a highly valuable chemical and crucial for manufacturing pharmaceuticals, pesticides, biologically active compounds, fragrance and dyes.5–8 In the conventional process, N-BD synthesis mainly relies on the condensation reaction between amines and carbonyl groups, which usually require a dehydrating agent, aldehydes, and Lewis acids as primary sources to drive the reaction at high temperature.9,10 Thus, the approach to obtain imine through direct amine oxidation under mild reaction conditions is promising. In this regard, the selective oxidative transformation of benzylamine (BA) to produce N-BD under solar light illumination over a photocatalyst has been attractive due to the absence of strong oxidants (such as permanganate, chromate and o-iodoxybenzoic acid) and complicated separation procedures.8,11–13
Recently, layered metal phosphorus trichalcogenides (MPX3, M is the metal; X = S, Se), as a promising family of two-dimensional semiconductor photocatalysts, demonstrate unique physical14 and catalytic properties.15–18 They usually possess a common crystal structure, in which each layer is stacked through a weak van der Waals force and metal cations (including M2+, M+ or M3+) are surrounded by [P2S6]4−or [P2Se6]4− units through ionic bonds with a honeycomb structure.19,20 The P site was thought to be the essential site for the hydrogen evolution reaction.21,22 Particularly for In4/3P2Se6, two-thirds of the M3+ sites are occupied by indium atoms in each layer, while one-third of them are vacancies. Hence, its chemical formula can be expressed as In4/3Y2/3P2Se6 (Y represents an indium vacancy).23–25Fig. 1a presents layered In4/3P2Se6 with a hexagonal crystal structure in the R3 space group. In each layer, the In ions are located in the middle with terminal [PSe3]2− layers;26,27 the Se atoms are arranged in hexagonal closest packing with regular octahedral voids, in which In3+ cations are filled.28–30 The density functional theory (DFT) calculations in Fig. S1† and Fig. 1b indicate that In4/3P2Se6 is a direct bandgap semiconductor with the band gap of 1.88 eV. Meanwhile, the valence band maximum (VBM) in the projected density of states (PDOS) is mainly composed of Se 3p orbitals, while the conduction band minimum (CBM) is composed of Se 3p and In 3d orbitals. Also, the theoretical calculations demonstrate that the P site is the adsorption active site for BA molecules on In4/3P2Se6 (Fig. S2†).

In this work, we synthesized the In4/3P2Se6 nanosheet as a photocatalyst to achieve the co-production of N-BD and hydrogen gas, via the space confined chemical vapor conversion method. Based on the experimental results, we found that the In4/3P2Se6 nanosheet sample demonstrated a direct bandgap of ∼1.94 eV with suitable band alignment for thermodynamically simultaneous hydrogen generation and imine synthesis. Specifically, the In4/3P2Se6 nanosheet photocatalyst delivered the co-production rates of 67 μmol g−1 h−1 for H2 and 43 μmol g−1 h−1 for N-BD from water reduction and BA oxidation under light illumination with continuous sixteen-hour reaction, suggesting the effective separation and utilization of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs. The photogenerated electrons react with water to produce H2, while the photogenerated holes oxidize the BA molecules to get N-BD molecules. Furthermore, we studied the cathodic half-reaction through adding the hole sacrificial agent to achieve higher hydrogen generation rates up to 4.1 mmol g−1 h−1. When we directly conducted the photocatalytic oxidation of BA under ambient conditions or introduced the oxygen gas in acetonitrile solvent, a promising N-BD yield of 47.7% was obtained under xenon light irradiation for 10 hours. In this case, O2 could firstly react with photogenerated electrons to give ˙O2− for promoting N-BD synthesis, which is proved through the in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements and control experiments. This work not only indicates the potential application of layered In4/3P2Se6 for organic chemical synthesis, but reveals the different reaction mechanisms for N-BD production with or without oxygen.
Experimental section
Chemicals
Benzylamine (99.00%, Macklin), InCl3 (99.99%, Aladdin), CH3CSNH2 (99%, Aladdin), Na2SO4 (99.5%, Aladdin), Na2SO3 (99%, Aladdin), Na2S·9H2O (99%, Aladdin), red phosphorus (100 mesh, 98.9%, Alfa Aesar) and selenium powder (200 mesh, 99.999%, Alfa Aesar) were used without further purification process. Deionized water (18.2 MΩ cm) through an ultrapure purification system (Milli-Q) was used in this work.
Synthesis of In4/3P2Se6 nanosheets
The In4/3P2Se6 nanosheets on carbon cloth were synthesized via a space confined chemical vapor conversion process using the synthesized In2S3 as a precursor in a tube furnace with two zones (Fig. S4†). Typically, a stoichiometric mixture of P and Se powders (0.75 g in total with the molar ratio of P:Se equal to 1:3) was placed at Zone I of the tube furnace, while the carbon cloth loaded with the In2S3 precursor was positioned at Zone II, and the distance between the two zones is about 20 cm. Before the reaction, the system was purged with argon gas with a flow rate of 100 sccm and vacuumed to create an air-free atmosphere. Then, the two zones were simultaneously heated to 280 °C and 360 °C, respectively, within 30 min and Zone II was kept at 360 °C for 60 min to complete the reaction. Finally, the furnace was naturally cooled to room temperature, and the carbon cloth with In4/3P2Se6 nanosheets was taken out for further measurement. The mass loading of In4/3P2Se6 nanosheets on the carbon cloth is about 1.5 mg cm−2.
Materials characterization
The thickness and morphology of In4/3P2Se6 nanosheets were characterized via atomic force microscopy (AFM, Bruker-M8) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi SU8220). High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM,JEM-2100F) and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopes (HAADF-STEM) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray diffractometer (EDX) were used to investigate the crystallinity and chemical compositions. The crystal structure was investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), employed from a TZY-XRD (D/MAX-TTRIII (COB)) using Cu-Kα radiation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (ESCALab 250Xi) with an X-ray source (Mg Kα). Raman spectra were collected on a Raman microscope (Renishaw, In Via) with a 532 nm excitation laser. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS, Lambda 750) using BaSO4 powder as a calibration substrate was used to record the light absorption curves in the wavelength range of 200–1000 nm. The valence band energy was analysed by Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS, Thermo Fisher Scientific, ESCALAB250XI) with HeI (21.22 eV) as the emission line.
Photoelectrochemical test
All photoelectrochemical measurements were conducted on an electrochemical workstation (Applied Research Potentiostat, VersaSTAT3) using a three-electrode cell. An Ag/AgCl electrode, Pt wire, and In4/3P2Se6 nanosheet film coated fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass were used as the reference, counter, and working electrodes, respectively. The working electrode was prepared as follows: the In4/3P2Se6 nanosheets were exfoliated from the surface of the carbon cloth to obtain a suspension (1.0 mg mL−1) through sonication in deionized water, which was then cast on the front side of FTO glass and sealed with epoxy resin to ensure that the exposed area of the In4/3P2Se6 nanosheet film is 0.5 × 0.5 cm2. Mott–Schottky (M–S) curves were collected at different frequencies of 1000 and 2000 Hz. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were performed at an open circuit potential in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz. Xenon lamps with different wavelength ranges (λ > 200 and λ > 300 nm) with the same power density of 200 mW cm−2 were employed as the light source during the test.

In situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)
Prior to the measurements, 3 mg of an In4/3P2Se6 nanosheet sample was dispersed in 50 μL of acetonitrile to obtain a suspension. 10 μL of 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) was added into the suspension to act as a trapping agent. Then, the mixed solution was firstly illuminated under a 300 W xenon lamp (λ > 300 nm, 200 mW cm−2) for 30 s, and immediately analysed using a variable temperature electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer (Bruker E500) operated at room temperature with a frequency of 9.844032 GHz at a power of 10.02 mW.
Water photocatalysis for hydrogen evolution
The photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction was carried out in a closed circulation system connected by a top-irradiation type reactor (500 mL quartz cell). During the test, the xenon lamps having different wavelength ranges (λ > 200 and λ > 300 nm) were used as the light sources. Typically, 5 mg of the In4/3P2Se6 nanosheet catalyst was placed in 100 mL of aqueous solution containing 0.25 M Na2S and 0.35 M Na2SO3. The generated H2 gas was analysed using an on-line gas chromatograph (GC7900, TCD detector, and a 5 Å molecular sieve column using argon as the carrier gas). Prior to the reaction, the system was evacuated to remove the air for the anaerobic conditions. The solution was continuously stirred during the test.
Photocatalytic oxidation of benzylamine C–N coupling for N-BD synthesis
Briefly, 20 mg of the In4/3P2Se6 photocatalyst was dispersed in 10 mL of CH3CN solution containing 0.2 mmol BA and sonicated for 30 min. Afterwards, the suspension was transferred to a 100 mL quartz glass vessel and irradiated using 300 W xenon lamps having different wavelength ranges (λ > 200 and λ > 300 nm) with continuous stirring. The reaction solution was taken out at certain time intervals and centrifuged for further qualification and quantification by 1H NMR (Bruker Avance III 400 HD), and the produced N-BD from the BA photo-catalytic oxidation process is evaluated through the yield, conversion and selectivity efficiencies by using the following equations:12,31 Yield (%) = [CN-BD × 2/C0] × 100(1) Conversion (%) = [(C0 − CBA)/C0] × 100(2) Selectivity (%) = [CN-BD × 2/C0 − CBA] × 100(3)
where C0 is the initial amount of BA, and CBA and CN-BD are the concentration of the residual BA and synthesized N-BD, respectively.
Photocatalytic co-production of hydrogen gas and N-BD
Photocatalytic H2 evolution integrated with selective oxidative coupling of BA was carried out in the previously mentioned online and closed circulation system. Typically, 20 mg of the photocatalyst was dispersed in a mixed solution containing 20 mL of CH3CN and 100 μL of deionized water (if needed) with 0.2 mmol of benzylamine in a 500 mL quartz glass vessel. Subsequently, the photoreactor was evacuated to remove the air and irradiated with a xenon lamp (λ > 300 nm) for continuous sixteen-hour reaction. The evolved gas was analysed at certain time intervals on online GC and the reaction solution was centrifuged to separate the catalysts for further qualification and quantification by 1H NMR at certain time intervals. In order to confirm all the products during the BA oxidation process, the reaction solution was also analysed on a high-resolution quadrupole-orbitrap Fourier transform mass spectrometer (Q-Exactive).
Theoretical calculations
The monolayer structure employs a 15 Å vacuum layer to prevent interactions between repeating slabs. All calculations are based on Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). These structures are fully relaxed under the effects of the Projector-augmented wave (PAW) potential and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof exchange–correlation function based on the GGA approximation. The DFT-D3 method, including the density functional theory (DFT) implemented in the Vienna Ab initio dispersion correction proposed by Grimme, was used to describe the van der Waals interaction between In4/3P2Se6 layers with a cut-off energy of 400 eV for plane waves and a convergence of electron self-consistent energy of 10−4 eV. The force convergence criterion of the yoke gradient algorithm is 0.05 eV Å−1. Electronic structures were calculated using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional and Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid density functional, and all calculations were spin-polarized.
For BA molecular adsorption on In4/3P2Se6, the adsorption energy (Eads) was calculated using eqn (4): (4)where Eads is the total adsorption energy of BA molecules on In4/3P2Se6, E* is the energy of one BA molecule adsorbed on the In4/3P2Se6 surface, and EBA is the initial energy of free BA molecules.
Results and discussion
We synthesized In4/3P2Se6 nanosheets on carbon cloth via a two-step process combining solvothermal and space confined chemical vapor conversion steps: first, the In2S3 precursor was synthesized on carbon cloth by the solvothermal method (Fig. S3 and Note S1†); then, the as-synthesized In2S3 nanosheets were converted to In4/3P2Se6 nanosheets through the chemical vapor conversion process in a tube furnace (Fig. S4†). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. S5†) show that the In4/3P2Se6 nanosheets are uniformly grown on the surface of carbon cloth. The energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis and corresponding elemental mapping demonstrate the homogeneous distribution of In, P, and Se with a ratio of 1.33:2.07:5.81 (Fig. S6†).
From the transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Fig. 1c) and atomic force microscopy (AFM, inset of Fig. 1d) images, the lateral size and thickness of some In4/3P2Se6 nanosheets are about 500 nm and 13.5 nm, respectively. In addition, the aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image clearly shows a lattice spacing of 1.87 Å, corresponding to the crystal plane of (030) (Fig. 1d). The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern shows well-defined (3–30), (300) and (030) planes, depicting the characteristic crystal plane of the hexagonal structure of In4/3P2Se6 along the [001] direction (Fig. 1e).
The crystal structure and phase purity of the as-synthesized In4/3P2Se6 nanosheets are further characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns, which are refined using the general structure analysis system (GSAS) software and Rietveld method (Fig. 1f). All Bragg diffraction peaks clearly show the standard hexagonal In4/3P2Se6 crystal structure with the R3 space group (PDF#77-0791). The refined lattice parameters are consistent with the values from the standard PXRD pattern (Table S1†). The Raman spectrum in Fig. 1g demonstrates the vibrational modes of the [P2Se6]4− group, which are three in-plane Eg (252, 281, 574 cm−1) and three out-of-plane A1g (268, 377, 478 cm−1) phonon modes.32 Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis performed on the In4/3P2Se6 nanosheet sample in In 3d, P 2p and Se 3d regions (Fig. S7†) shows the In 3d3/2 and In 3d5/2 peaks at 452.2 eV and 444.6 eV, P 2p5/2 peak at 131.9 eV and Se 3d5/2 peak at 53.4 eV in the [P2Se6]4− group. The additional peak at a binding energy of 138.9 eV originates from the overlap of the Se Auger emission line and the P 2p core level.17,33 To evaluate the light-harvesting capability, the UV-vis diffuse-reflectance spectrum (DRS) of the In4/3P2Se6 nanosheet sample was tested (Fig. 2a). Its bandgap (Eg) is then estimated to be 1.94 eV through the Kubelka–Munk equation, which is consistent with the theoretically calculated value of 1.88 eV and reported ones.32,34 Next, ultraviolet (UPS) analysis and Mott–Schottky measurements were conducted to estimate the positions of the CBM and VBM (Fig. S8 and S9†). The Mott–Schottky curves collected at different frequencies indicate a typical n-type In4/3P2Se6 with a flat band potential of −0.48 V versus a normal hydrogen electrode (VNHE). The VBM of In4/3P2Se6 is estimated to be 1.18 VNHE (−5.62 eV vs. vacuum level) based on the UPS spectrum (Fig. S8†). Thus, the CBM level could be calculated to be −0.76 VNHE (−3.68 eV vs. vacuum level). According to the above results, the band alignment of the In4/3P2Se6 nanosheet, combined with the redox potentials of BA/BA˙+ (+0.76 VNHE), O2/˙O2− (−0.33 VNHE), H+/H2 (−0.41 VNHE) and H2O/O2 (+0.82 VNHE) at pH = 7.0 is shown in Fig. 2b. Hence, it can be concluded that: (i) the band alignment of In4/3P2Se6 reveals that it is appropriate thermodynamically to drive the hydrogen evolution reaction under light illumination; (ii) the photogenerated electrons could reduce the dissolved O2 gas into ˙O2− due to the more negative redox potential of O2/˙O2− (−0.33 VNHE); and (iii) the redox potential of BA oxidation to BA˙+ (+0.76 VNHE) is well above the VBM of In4/3P2Se6, making the photocatalytic oxidation of BA feasible.35,36 With these, we firstly studied the photoelectrochemical properties of In4/3P2Se6 nanosheet film on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass electrode in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The transient photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out at an open circuit potential under xenon light with different wavelength ranges (λ > 200 nm and λ > 300 nm). As shown in Fig. S10 and 11,† the photocurrent density reaches up to 15.0 μA cm−2 along with a smaller charge transfer resistance of 4.6 kΩ under light illumination (λ > 200 nm). This can be attributed to the fact that the In4/3P2Se6 nanosheet can absorb more photons when using the light source with a wider wavelength range of λ > 200 nm, and its better photo-responsiveness in the deep-ultraviolet region (200–300 nm). Then, the H2 evolution activity of the In4/3P2Se6 nanosheet photocatalyst was evaluated in the presence of sacrificial agents (0.25 M Na2S and 0.35 M Na2SO3). Fig. 2c and d show continuous hydrogen generation rates of ∼120 μmol g−1 h−1 (λ > 300 nm) and ∼4.1 mmol g−1 h−1 (λ > 200 nm), indicating the promising activity for photocatalytic hydrogen generation over In4/3P2Se6 nanosheets and efficient utilization of photogenerated electrons.

(b) Band alignment of the In4/3P2Se6 nanosheet sample combined with the redox potentials of BA/BA˙+ (+0.76 VNHE), O2/˙O2− (−0.33 VNHE), H+/H2 (−0.41 VNHE) and H2O/O2 (+0.82 VNHE) at pH = 7.0. (c and d) Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of the In4/3P2Se6 nanosheet catalyst under λ > 300 nm and λ > 200 nm light illumination with the same power density (200 mW cm−2). When running different cycles with the same sample, the evolved H2 gas in the gas phase was pumped away at the moment of the sign (↓), “evac” in (c) and (d) denotes the “evacuate” step. 
Driven by the suitable potential shown in Fig. 2b, BA photocatalytic oxidation reaction over the In4/3P2Se6 nanosheet catalyst was conducted for producing N-BD through utilizing photogenerated holes. Firstly, this reaction is preliminarily evaluated in 10 mL of acetonitrile solvent under ambient conditions with illumination with xenon light. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of the solution after the reaction was performed by 1H NMR, through the standard curves with different concentrated BA (Fig. S13†) and N-BD (Fig. S14†) molecules, using CD3CN-d3 with dioxane as an internal standard37 (Fig. S12†). Reaction optimization using 20 mg of the In4/3P2Se6 nanosheet catalyst (entry 5 in Table 1) with 10 h reaction involving oxygen gas affords N-BD synthesis with the highest yield of 57.9% in 0.2 mmol of the BA substrate. A control reaction without a catalyst delivered a small amount of N-BD due to the self-coupling between photoexcited BA (entry 1).38,39 Note that no N-BD was detected under dark conditions, while only a trace amount of N-BD was detected without air (i.e., the reactor under anaerobic conditions after being evacuated) under light illumination (entries 2 and 3). These suggest that the oxidation of BA molecules is a photocatalytic process, and O2 is crucial to facilitating this process. To gain further insight, control reactions were conducted under the conditions with the help of electron (entry 6), hole (entry 7) and superoxide radical (entry 8) scavengers and as high as 17.0%, 8.5% and 23.8% N-BD yields, respectively, are accordingly achieved. This verifies that (i) the generated superoxide radicals through the reduction of O2 and photogenerated electrons are involved in the photo-oxidation of BA to N-BD and (ii) the photogenerated holes and superoxide radicals are the major reactive species for the oxidative transformation of BA to N-BD.

Fig. 3a shows the reaction time-dependent performance for oxidative transformation of BA to N-BD under ambient conditions. It can be seen that as the reaction time increases from 2 h to 10 h, the conversion efficiency increases from 5.25% to 48.9% with a high selectivity of >95% for N-BD production. Additionally, we also conducted the reaction time-dependent performance for BA oxidation reaction under the same conditions by using a λ > 200 nm xenon lamp. It can be seen that the conversion of BA was nearly 100% after 10 h reaction, but the selectivity was only 44.24% for N-BD production (Fig. S15a†). The corresponding 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. S15b†) shows that there are some by-products produced such as benzaldehyde, which is possibly due to the over-oxidation of BA molecules under deep-ultraviolet light illumination. To further confirm the involved reactive species during the photocatalysis, we conducted in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) as trapping agents for ˙O2−. As shown in Fig. 3b, compared with the signals under the dark conditions, the EPR signal of the ˙O2− species, produced through the reaction between the dissolved O2 gas and photogenerated electrons under light illumination,13,40,41 are clearly detected for promoting N-BD production. This also explains the phenomenon that the N-BD yield increases from 47.7% in entry 4 to 57.9% in entry 5 (Table 1) when bubbling O2 gas into the substrate solution. Meanwhile, these results prove that the In4/3P2Se6 nanosheet catalyst possesses strong capability to activate O2 molecules into the ˙O2− species under light illumination. With the above results, we have proposed the reaction mechanism under ambient conditions in Fig. 3c. Both the photogenerated electrons and holes are involved in the oxidative transformation of BA to N-BD.

(a) Time-dependent N-BD yield, conversion and corresponding selectivity of BA over In4/3P2Se6. (b) Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra obtained using DMPO as the free-radical trapping agent under different reaction conditions, indicating no detected signal appearing without the catalyst. (c) Proposed reaction mechanism for the photocatalytic oxidative transformation of BA to N-BD catalysed by In4/3P2Se6 under an air or oxygen atmosphere. 
The photogenerated electrons produced on the In4/3P2Se6 nanosheet under light illumination activate the adsorbed O2 molecules to produce ˙O2− radicals, which further facilitate the catalytic oxidation of BA.12 Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes directly oxidize BA molecules to BA˙+ (step I). Then, ˙O2− could further react with BA˙+ to yield an imine intermediate along with the hydrogen peroxide (steps II and III). Finally, the imine intermediate could be further oxidized by photogenerated holes to produce N-BD molecules through coupling with another BA molecule, releasing an ammonia molecule as a by-product (steps IV and V).42 Note that air could also promote the oxidative transformation of BA with the same reaction mechanism, resulting in the highest yield and selectivity (>95%) of N-BD (Fig. 3a).
Motivated by the suitable band alignment of In4/3P2Se6 in Fig. 2b, we next performed photocatalysis for co-production of H2 and N-BD in 20 mL of acetonitrile mixed with 100 μL of H2O without detectable dissolved oxygen under anaerobic conditions. The co-production yields of H2 and N-BD are 895 μmol g−1 and 681 μmol g−1, respectively, with continuous 16 h reaction under xenon light illumination (Fig. 4a).
 Fig. 4  Photocatalytic co-production of H2 and N-BD over an In4/3P2Se6 nanosheet catalyst. Reaction conditions: acetonitrile (20 mL), H2O (100 μL), catalyst (20 mg), and BA substrate (0.2 mmol) under room temperature and anaerobic conditions, where the reactor was evacuated before conducting the reaction and no detectable dissolved oxygen was present. (a) Reaction time-dependent co-production of H2 and N-BD under xenon light illumination (λ > 300 nm, 200 mW cm−2). (b) Proposed reaction mechanism for the photocatalytic oxidative transformation of BA to N-BD catalyzed by the In4/3P2Se6 nanosheet without air or O2 involvement. 
Considering that no oxygen is involved in this process, which is different from that under aerobic conditions, we hypothesize that the photo-generated electrons could preferentially react with H2O molecules to produce H2 gas. Fig. S16† shows the 1H NMR spectrum collected from the reaction mixture after co-synthesis of H2 and N-BD for 16 h. The chemical shift at 3.55 ppm and 3.71 ppm corresponds to the internal standard (dioxane) and reactant BA, respectively. The N-BD signal appears at 4.72 ppm and 8.38 ppm, indicating that the desired N-BD product is synthesized from BA oxidation. On the basis of the aforementioned results, a plausible reaction mechanism for photocatalytic co-production of H2 and N-BD over In4/3P2Se6 nanosheets is proposed (Fig. 4b).43–46 In Step I, electron–hole pairs could be firstly generated from the In4/3P2Se6 nanosheet under light illumination. The photogenerated electrons can be transferred to the catalyst surface for reducing H2O to produce hydrogen and OH−, while the photogenerated holes oxidized BA to benzylamine cation free radicals (BA˙+) due to the matched redox potential of BA/BA˙+. Then, the deprotonation process of Steps II and III could take place to successively afford carbon-centered benzylamine radicals and the imine intermediate, along with the release of protons, which may be further reduced by the photogenerated electrons for H2 molecules or react with the previously generated OH− to form H2O molecules.47 Finally, the imine intermediate is coupled with another BA molecule forming N-BD (Step IV).
Based on the reaction mechanism and hypothesis, the molar ratio between the produced H2 gas and N-BD should be 1:2. But, from the co-production yields of these two products in Fig. 4a, the quantity of N-BD is much smaller than the evolution of H2, because the changed polarity of the solvent after adding water could affect the adsorption/desorption properties of the intermediate during the BA oxidation process,46 thus leading to the decreased selectivity of N-BD and generation of other byproducts (Fig. S17†). In order to prove this point, we conducted positive-ion electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (Fig. S18†) analysis and further confirmed the presence of the byproduct N-(amino(phenyl)methyl)benzamide, which is consistent with the small peak at 4.41 ppm in the 1H NMR spectra (Fig. S16†). Moreover, we conducted the co-production of H2 and N-BD from BA oxidation under the same conditions only using acetonitrile as the solvent (Fig. S19†). Compared with the results obtained in the presence of 100 μL of H2O, the hydrogen evolution rate was decreased from 67 μmol g−1 h−1 to 2.2 μmol g−1 h−1, suggesting that the photogenerated electrons preferentially react with water to produce hydrogen gas and a small amount of H2 gas could be generated through the reaction between the photogenerated electrons and the protons released from Steps II and III in Fig. 4b. In a word, the co-production of H2 and N-BD over the In4/3P2Se6 nanosheet indicates an efficient separation and utilization of photogenerated carriers.11
Moreover, the In4/3P2Se6 photocatalyst exhibits robust stability after long term (>10 h) continuous reaction. XRD patterns collected from the In4/3P2Se6 nanosheets before and after the reaction show the preserved crystal structure (Fig. S20 and 21†). The corresponding SEM and TEM images also verify that there is no change in the morphology and crystallinity of the In4/3P2Se6 nanosheet. To further investigate the recyclability of the In4/3P2Se6 catalyst, 20 mg of In4/3P2Se6 was used for 3 consecutive cycles under similar conditions (Fig. S22†), indicating a slight decrease in the catalytic activity. Meanwhile, we also tested the BA photo-oxidation to N-BD over the In4/3P2S6 nanosheet photocatalyst48 under the same conditions within three consecutive cycles (Fig. S23†). Compared with the performance of the In4/3P2Se6 nanosheet photocatalyst, Fig. S23b† shows that the selectivity and yield of N-BD over the In4/3P2S6 nanosheet photocatalyst significantly reduced from 42.5% to 25.67% and 42.50% to 20.42%, respectively when conducting three consecutive cycles, suggesting the poor activity and stability for N-BD production over the In4/3P2S6 nanosheet. These results indicate the promising photocatalytic activity of the In4/3P2Se6 nanosheet for BA oxidation to N-BD. Note that, only the representative In4/3P2Se6 nanosheet, without any co-catalyst, is used to achieve the photocatalytic co-production of H2 and N-BD from water and BA, demonstrating the promising activity in overall H2 production integrated with organic synthesis. In future, many more studies could be performed by loading co-catalysts,44,49 constructing heterostructures,43,50–52 engineering defects12,53,54etc. to improve the overall activity of this photocatalytic coupling system. In this regard, some kinds of MPX3 materials possess a suitable band alignment to thermodynamically drive some reactions such as oxidative coupling of amines and selective oxidation of alcohols,25,55 which gives the potential for the MPX3-based materials to be used in the organic synthesis of high value-added chemicals.
Conclusions
In summary, we successfully synthesized In4/3P2Se6 nanosheets via a space confined chemical vapor conversion method which enabled the co-production of H2 and N-BD via a photocatalytic process. The as-synthesized In4/3P2Se6 nanosheets exhibit promising photocatalytic activity and stability for separate H2 evolution and N-BD production from BA oxidation with a high yield and selectivity. More importantly, the layered In4/3P2Se6 nanosheets showed promising photocatalytic activity for co-production of N-BD and H2 in water contained a BA substrate. This work opens a new path to utilize the MPX3 materials for high value-added chemicals through a photocatalytic synthesis process.
