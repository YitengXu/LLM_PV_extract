    , Accepted 4th June 2019First published on 5th June 2019AbstractBy reducing the gap between lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and supercapacitors (SCs) effectively, lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) have attracted tremendous attention among various electrochemical energy storage systems because they exhibit a high energy density (inherited from the LIBs), a high power output, long lifespan (owing to the SCs) and favorable chemical stability. Carbonaceous electrode materials play significant roles in high performance dual-carbon LICs whether positive or negative. Here, the working mechanism, cell design principle and recent progress in carbon-based electrode materials for dual-carbon LICs are illustrated. Then, the commercialization of LICs is discussed briefly. Finally, some suggestions for the future developments associated with dual-carbon LICs are proposed.
1. Introduction
In light of increasing concern about energy shortages and environmental protection, green energy, such as solar power, wind power, geothermal energy, tidal power and so forth, are being highlighted by researchers.1–3 However, the intermittent features of these energy resources hinder their direct application and therefore accelerate the development of energy storage and conversion devices. Electrochemical energy storage shows advantages over various energy storage systems owing to its high operating efficiency, environmentally friendliness and low cost. Several efficient electrochemical energy storage devices have been studied and commercialized, as demonstrated in Fig. 1a. Typically, lithium ion batteries (LIBs), which are commercially applied in portable electronic devices and electric vehicles, exhibit a high energy density (150–200 W h kg−1) in an organic electrolyte system, and manifest no memory effects when compared with traditional Pb-acid and Ni-Cd/Ni-MH batteries.4,5 Supercapacitors (SCs) are considered as potential candidates for large-scale energy storage because of their superior high power density (>10 kW kg−1) and long-term cyclic stability (10000–100000 cycles) in a non-aqueous liquid electrolyte.4,6 Unfortunately, the relatively low power density (<1000 W kg−1) and short lifespan (<4000 times) of LIBs and the insufficient energy density of SCs (5–10 W h kg−1) restrict their further development in energy related fields. Therefore, researchers have been making extensive efforts to exploit novel energy storage devices that combine the advantages of LIBs and SCs but break through their barriers.

Fortunately, lithium-ion capacitors (LICs), also known as lithium-ion hybrid supercapacitors, which can conquer the limitations of LIBs and SCs, provide this possibility (Fig. 1a and b). The attractive LICs not only possess a higher power density and longer cycle life than LIBs, but also a higher energy density compared to SCs. In principle, LIBs consist of a lithium-containing chemical cathode, separator, electrolyte and anode materials.9 LIBs work by Li+ moving back and forth between the electrodes accompanied by the bulk redox reaction of the electrode materials. Based on the charge storage mechanisms, SCs can be divided into pseudocapacitors (PCs) and electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs).10 PCs store the energy using the fast surface redox reaction on the surface of the electrode materials, such as metal oxides, metal sulfides and conducting polymers. For EDLCs however energy storage is achieved by fast ion absorption and desorption on the surface of the porous carbon with a high specific surface area (SSA). In fact, LICs can be considered as the integration of the positive electrode of EDLCs and the negative electrode of LIBs (Fig. 1b). Benefiting from this intelligent configuration, the shortages of both SCs and LIBs are readily surmounted (Fig. 1c). Generally, LICs can be distinguished as dual-carbon, non-carbon and hybrid types, differentiated by whether the electrodes are carbon materials or not.
A number of early-stage review articles addressing advances in electrode materials, electrolytes and the device construction of LICs have been very helpful in our efforts to understand the LICs. For example, Kötz introduced the principles and applications of electrochemical capacitors as early as 2000.11 After that, the first LICs were reported by Amatucci and co-workers in 2001, employing activated carbon (AC) as a positive electrode, nano-structured Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) as a negative electrode, and a lithium-ion containing organic salt as the electrolyte (LiPF6 in EC:DMC).12 Since then, several significant works have been presented and summarized, focusing on the different aspects (e.g., electrode materials, electrolyte, and device construction) of LICs.6,7,10,13 Typically, Yan and Zhang discussed the materials design and device construction of conventional supercapacitors and several new-concept supercapacitors, including LICs.14 Yan and Fan focused on the pseudo-capacitive oxide negative electrodes (Nb2O5, MoO3, etc.) and their application in non-aqueous hybrid lithium or sodium ion capacitors.4 Zheng and Zhang reported recent progress in electrode materials concentrating on AC and LTO, electrolytes and challenges in non-aqueous LICs.5 Li and Liu summarized the recent progress and future prospects of battery-supercapacitor hybrid devices.15
Benefiting from the low cost, abundant resources, plenty of allotropes and transformations as well as superior physical/chemical stability, carbonaceous materials have been widely studied and utilized in energy storage fields including LICs.16–19 Dual-carbon LICs (DC-LICs), in which both electrodes are composed of carbon materials, possess the most promising industrial prospects. The overall cost of DC-LICs can be largely decreased because of the abundance and low price of carbon. More importantly, DC-LICs exhibit a much better long-term cyclic stability than LICs containing metal contained insertion-type electrodes or alloy-type negative materials. It should be noted that DC-LICs that employ AC as a positive electrode and prelithiated graphite as a negative electrode have been commercialized successfully. However, to the best of our knowledge, the progress on DC-LICs has not been summarized. Therefore, in this paper, the working principle, cell design and recent progress on carbon-based electrode materials for DC-LICs are summarized. Meanwhile, we give a brief introduction to the commercialization of DC-LICs. Finally, the future prospects and challenges for DC-LICs are proposed with the purpose of achieving a satisfactory electrochemical performance for next-generation commercial applications.
2. Working principle of DC-LICs
In principle, DC-LICs employ prelithiated carbon as a negative electrode, a double-layer capacitive carbon as a positive electrode and a lithium-salt containing organic solution as an electrolyte. The capacitor-type positive electrode of DC-LICs is attached by a non-faradaic process during the charge–discharge process in which the voltage is in a linear relationship with the charge/discharge time. The battery-type negative electrode maintains a constant potential during the charge/discharge process, associated to the faradaic reaction controlled by the diffusion process. In DC-LICs system, the energy density of the entire cell is determined by the specific capacitance of the positive electrode, considering that the specific capacity of negative electrode is much higher than the positive electrode. Although the power density is mainly influenced by the battery-type negative electrode that manifests sluggish kinetics behavior.20 The energy density is proportional to the voltage square and the specific capacitance according to eqn (1),21 the capacitance of an EDLC electrode is usually estimated according to eqn (2),22 and the power density can be estimated using eqn (3).23 (1)
In which C is the specific capacitance of the electrode materials which is determined by the charge storage area and the separation distance of the electrodes according to eqn (2), V represents the working voltage window which depends on the potential difference of the positive electrode and the negative electrode. (2)in which A is assigned to the effective electrode surface area which immersed in the electrolyte, ε0 represents the vacuum permittivity, εr is the electrolyte dielectric constant and d is the effective thickness of the double layer located at the electrolyte/electrode interfaces. (3)
In which V is equal to the working voltage, m represents the mass of electrodes, and Rs is determined by the equivalent series resistance.
The charge–discharge process of DC-LICs is described by combining the LIBs and SCs (Fig. 2). During the charge process of a typical LiCoO2//graphite LIBs (Fig. 2a), it follows the principle that Li+ deserts from the LiCoO2 cathode and is inserted into the graphite anode, and the electrons transfer from the cathode to the anode through the external circuit. During the discharge process, the Li+ converses back from the anode to the cathode, realizing the energy conversion between the chemical energy and electrical energy by reversible Li+ transportation accompanied with redox reactions.15 As for the EDLCs (Fig. 2b), ion absorption and desorption occurs during the charge–discharge process.
 Fig. 2  Schematic diagrams for working mechanisms of (a) LIBs, (b) EDLCs and (c) LICs. 
In a typical DC-LICs system (Fig. 2c), the lithium-ion interaction and de-interaction reaction occur reversibly in the negative electrode during the charge/discharge process. Meanwhile, the absorption and desorption of ions occurs in the positive electrode. Note that at the positive electrode side, the absorption and desorption behavior changes with the voltage. Specifically, when the potential of the positive electrode is increased, the desorption of the cation (herein Li+) occurs below 3.0 V and the absorption of the anion mainly occurs above 3.0 V.24 The electrochemical reaction of the typical AC//graphite DC-LICs can simply be summarized as follows in eqn (4) and (5). There is another type of DC-LICs, namely hybrid DC-LICs, in which one or more of the electrodes experiences both a faradaic and non-faradaic reaction mechanism (such as graphene//graphene).
Anodic reaction:  C + xe− + xLi+ ↔ LixC(4)
Cathodic reaction:  C + xLi+ + xe− ↔ C⋯Lix, below 3.0 V(5) or C + xA− ↔ C⋯Ax + xe−, above 3.0 V(6)
The different working mechanisms for the positive/negative electrodes in DC-LICs result in a wide voltage window, which is helpful for increasing the energy density of the device. Furthermore, the fast absorption and desorption reaction of the ions on the positive electrode surface guarantees a higher power density than traditional LIBs. According to the previous work, the advantages of DC-LICs can be summarized as follows:4,6,25,26 (i) higher energy density and low self-discharge rate (<5% voltage drop at room temperature) compared to SCs; (ii) higher power density when compared to LIBs; (iii) high reliability; (iv) wide operating temperature ranging from −20 to 70 °C. However, because the non-faradaic reaction associated with the absorption and desorption process on the positive electrode surface is much faster than the faradaic process in the bulk negative electrode, the main challenge of DC-LICs is the kinetic imbalance of the capacitor-type carbon positive electrode and the battery-type carbon negative electrode. Therefore, a high-capacity carbon negative electrode, particularly with a superior rate performance is preferred, in order to match the barrier between the positive and negative electrode. In addition, improvement of the specific capacitance of the capacitor-type carbon positive electrode is urgently needed as it limits the energy density of the DC-LICs.
3. Carbon-based electrode materials for DC-LICs
As mentioned above, the electrode material has a critical influence on the electrochemical performance of DC-LICs for achieving a high energy and high power output. To realize this target, various kinds of carbon materials have been investigated as active electrode materials in DC-LICs, such as AC, graphite, graphitic carbon, graphene, hard carbon (HC), and so forth.13,22,27
3.1 Carbon materials as a positive electrode for DC-LICs
Having an electrochemical double-layer energy storage mechanism, the capacitor-type carbon materials used as a positive electrode for DC-LICs should possess the merits of: (i) a high SSA of more than 1000 m2 g−1 to obtain an outstanding specific capacitance; (ii) a high operating voltage to ensure a high energy density; (iii) a superior electronic conductivity to achieve a high power; and (iv) an excellent electrolyte accessibility through the intrapore space.5,28 In general, the higher the SSA of the porous carbon, the larger the specific capacitance. As such, the high energy density of DC-LICs is realized according to eqn (1). However, the specific capacitance is not always linear to the SSA.5 The pore size distribution and surface specialties also contribute to the electrochemical performance of capacitive carbon materials. Typically, the pore sizes can be divided into micropore (<2 nm), mesopore (2–50 nm) and macropore (>50 nm). The mesopores and macropores can provide a passport for ions and accommodate the electrolyte, while electrolyte accessibility in the micropores below 0.5 nm is difficult.28 Nevertheless, Salitra et al. suggested that the micropores can lead to the desolvation of ions and thus contribute to an improved capacitance.29 Therefore, it is assumed that a combination of micropores and mesopores is an ideal solution for the aim of maximizing capacitance. In addition, the functional groups and doping with heteroatoms also makes a difference to the performance by tuning the electronic structure and micromorphology. Taking the above considerations into account, we have summarized the latest developments on capacitive carbon positive electrode materials for DC-LICs, ranging from porous carbon and graphene to nitrogen-doped carbon materials (Table 1 and Fig. 3). The effects of the SSA, size optimization, microstructure control and heteroatoms doping are highlighted.

3.1.1 Porous carbon. 
Activated carbon, a commercial porous carbon product, has drawn worldwide attention since its first application as a positive electrode material in LICs by Amatucci in 2001, benefiting from the characteristics of a mature manufacture technique, low cost, high SSA (up to 2000 m2 g−1), benign chemical and thermal stability, wide operation temperature window, nontoxicity, and so forth.12 As early as in 2008, Béguin et al. investigated AC as a positive electrode for a DC-LICs system.41 At the optimal voltage of 1.5–4.5 V, the hybrid capacitor delivered a high gravimetric energy density of 103.8 W h kg−1. In addition, Shaw et al. investigated the impact of surface functionalization on the AC positive electrode, revealing that solution chemistry treatment was an effective way to increase the specific capacitance of the AC powder.42 The mechanism of capacitance improvement was attributed mainly to the pseudocapacitive redox reaction on the CO sites. In addition, Huang and co-workers employed AC as a positive electrode and graphdiyne (GDY) as a negative electrode to construct DC-LICs, which demonstrated an energy density of 112.2 W h kg−1 with a 94.7% retention after 1000 cycles in the voltage range of 2–4 V (Fig. 4).30 Even at a power density of 1000.4 W kg−1, the GDY//AC DC-LICs delivered a high energy density of 95.1 W h kg−1.

However, the unsatisfied electrical conductivity and low specific capacitance restricts the further development of AC. The pore size has a significant effect on the specific capacitance of porous carbon. Generally, AC, with a narrow pore size distribution (accessible to the electrolyte ions) and short pore length, can be workable to achieve high energy density DC-LICs that do not deteriorate the power density and cycle life.22 Zhou et al. presented an ordered mesoporous carbon with a narrow size distribution in the mesopore range of 2–50 nm.43 The as-prepared mesoporous carbon broke through the drawbacks of conventional AC and exhibited a superior electrochemical performance. Moreover, if the pore size matches the radius of the electrolyte ions, the capacitance will be largely increased. For example, Gogotsi et al. demonstrated a carbide-derived carbon with improved capacitance, revealing that charge storage in pores smaller than the diameters of the solvated electrolyte ions (<1 nm) could obtain a higher capacitance.44
Recently, researchers have focused on biomass-derived porous carbon because of concerns regarding environmental protection, renewability and the abundant nature of the raw materials. Many meaningful features can be retained if the porous carbon is achieved from biomass, such as a superior physical/chemical stability, adequate functional groups that can tune the structure in the following annealing process, heteroatom doping structures and plenty of microstructures can benefit from the multitudinous raw materials. Ogale et al. exploited a novel 3D porous carbon derived from an oligomer-salt as a positive electrode material for DC-LICs which showed an energy density of ∼63 W h kg−1.45 Guo et al. presented a hierarchical porous carbon as a capacitive material in DC-LICs through hydrothermal treatment and chemical activation of natural sisal fiber (Fig. 5a–f). It showed an energy density of 41 W h kg−1 even at a power density of 5.7 kW kg−1.33 Lee et al. obtained porous carbon from Prosopis juliflora and utilized it as a positive electrode material in DC-LICs with graphite as a negative electrode (Fig. 5g and h). The as-assembled device exhibited a specific energy density of 162.3 W h kg−1 with approximately 79% capacity retention after 7000 cycles.17 In addition, Zhang and Cai reported carbon derived from egg whites with a SSA as high as 3250 m2 g−1 and which exhibited a superior DC-LICs performance with both a high energy density (257 W h kg−1) and a high power density (29893 W kg−1).46 Furthermore, carbon materials derived from corn cobs, teak wood, rice husk, Chinese chive, orange peel and other biomass resources were also investigated as positive electrode materials in LICs and showed excellent electrochemical performances.17,34–36,47–50 Although different biomass-derived porous carbons have been studied and have achieved a remarkable performance, some fundamental issues are still questionable. For example, understanding and controlling the properties (pore size distribution, pore structures, functional groups, SSA) of biomass-derived porous carbon is a hard task owing to the various kinds of biomass resources with different pristine characteristics.

3.1.2 Graphene
Graphene has been widely explored in DC-LICs as a positive or negative electrode owing to the unique physical and chemical stability.6,27 The theoretical SSA of graphene is up to 2630 m2 g−1, which together with the excellent electrical conductivity, charge transport mobility and chemical stability as well as the superior mechanical properties, make it a promising substitute to AC as a positive electrode for DC-LICs.5 Liu et al. reported the ethylene glycol assisted-hydrothermal synthesis of reduced graphene (EG-RGO) as a positive electrode material for DC-LICs. The power density reached 53.5 kW kg−1 at a current density of 20 A g−1 with an energy density of 240 W h kg−1.51 Madhavi and co-workers prepared trigol reduced graphene oxide nanosheets as a positive electrode material, which delivered an energy density of 45 W h kg−1 accompanied with a power density of 33 kW kg−1.52 In addition, 3D rebar graphene foams and activated graphene-based aerogel composites also emerged as potential positive electrode candidates for DC-LICs.53,54 A composite of single-walled carbon nanotube and graphene (SG) was successfully revealed by Tang's group which delivered an energy density of 222 W h kg−1 at a power density of 410 W kg−1 with a long-term cyclic stability.38 Recently, Guo et al. demonstrated novel gaphene@hierarchical meso/microporous carbon composites as positive electrode materials in DC-LICs (Fig. 6).39 The as-assembled DC-LICs device reached ultrahigh energy densities of 233.3–143.8 W h kg−1 at power densities ranging from 450.4 to 1.57 kW kg−1. Although many strategies for preparing graphene have been developed, the controllable and scalable methods used to synthesize high-quality graphene in a simple way are still questionable, prohibiting its commercialization in LICs, especially in DC-LICs. Moreover, the low initial coulombic efficiency and capacity fading of graphene cannot be ignored.

3.1.3 Nitrogen-doped carbon materials. 
Doping is an effective way to improve the energy and power properties by introducing heteroatoms (such as boron, nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur) into the carbon matrix. Typically, the introduced heteroatoms can provide an enhanced conductivity, and enrich the active sites for Li+ storage by a pseudocapacitive interaction reaction.48,55,56 Nitrogen doping can be attractive in particular because of the rich bonding configurations of the N atom with the carbon in the lattice may contribute p electrons to the Π system and improve the carrier transport.57 N-Doped carbon materials have been widely employed as electrode active materials in DC-LICs with a superior electrochemical performance. Kang and Huang presented N-enriched hierarchical porous carbon (N-GMCs), which manifested a hierarchical porous structure, a 3D conductive network, and a very high mass density.40 The DC-LICs composed of an N-GMCs positive electrode delivered a high energy density of 80 W h kg−1 (68.6 W h L−1) and an ultrahigh power density (352 kW kg−1, 292 kW L−1), which were 5 and 2.8 times greater than those of the supercapacitor, respectively. Zhang et al. obtained the positive electrode materials by activating nitrogen-doped porous carbon microspheres (NPCM-A) and negative electrode materials of NPCM from polyimide nanosheets (Fig. 7).32 The energy density of this device reached 95.1 W h kg−1 and retained 48.2 W h kg−1 even at a high power density of 15 kW kg−1 with an 80.1% capacity retention after 5000 cycles. Furthermore, nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon (N-HPC) derived from magnesium citrate and subsequent NH3 treatment was also used as a positive electrode material by Kang's group.58

3.2 Carbon materials as a negative electrode for DC-LICs
Apart from the positive electrode materials, the type of negative lithium-ions interaction is also an important component for DC-LICs. The selection of negative electrode materials makes a significant contribution to the attainment of a high energy density, high power density, long cycling stability and reliable safety DC-LICs devices. The low operating voltage and superior electrical conductivity are critical for negative electrode materials.5,59 For DC-LICs, graphite (graphitic carbon) and HC are widely investigated as negative materials. In addition to these, other carbonaceous based materials such as graphene, soft carbon, carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibers were also detected as negative materials in DC-LICs (Table 2 and Fig. 8).60–64 All of these candidates possess their merits and drawbacks in practical applications. Although commercially available graphite shows a high plateau capacity and a high initial coulombic efficiency, its poor rate capability is a big problem especially for high power DC-LICs. As for graphitic carbon (GC), the induced defects during the catalytic graphitization process are beneficial to the fast kinetics of the lithium-ion interaction reaction. However, the low coulombic efficiency of GC prohibits its practical application. As for HC, it suffers from voltage hysteresis and a slope-type charge–discharge profile. The low coulombic efficiency and capacity fading are the main problems for graphene and other carbonaceous materials.

3.2.1 Graphite. 
Graphite, with a hexagonal mesh structure formed from carbon atoms, has been utilized as a negative electrode material in commercial LIBs products since 1991. Graphite can supply a high plateau capacity of around 300 mA h g−1 below 0.2 V which can guarantee a stable charge–discharge plateau, making it a promising candidate for DC-LICs negative material. The suitability of conventional graphite for use as a negative electrode in DC-LICs was assessed by Pandolfo and co-workers.76 Different kinds of commercial graphite were compared to evaluate the performance of the lithium-ions exchange rate. Huang et al. employed a graphite negative electrode together with a graphitic porous carbon positive electrode to construct DC-LICs, for which the energy density was maintained at 48 W h kg−1 even at a power density of 7.4 kW kg−1.31 However, graphite suffers from a poor rate capability caused by the high crystallinity and anisotropy which further restricts the power density of DC-LICs.5 Decreasing the thickness and reducing the particle size is an effective method to improve the rate performance of graphite and achieve an improved power density in DC-LICs. However, the initial capacity loss increases with the decreased size and results in a low coulombic efficiency, consuming extra lithium-ions. In addition, ball milling, surface coating with highly-conductive carbon, control of the degree of graphitization, and the introduction of defects are also used to improve the rate capability of graphite.20,77,78


3.2.2 Graphitized carbon. 
Graphitized carbon, for which the interlayer space and microstructures can be readily adjusted, possesses the most promising perspectives for use in LICs negative electrodes. The co-existence of graphitic structures and amorphous structures provides GC with the ability to balance the high plateau capacity and the superior rate performance effectively. Catalytic graphitization with the assistance of a metal-ion is an effective method to prepare GC in relatively moderate conditions (<1200 °C).79 The degree of graphitization can be controlled by tuning the temperature, precursor structures and catalyst. Whereas, owing to the intrinsic defects, GC suffers from a relatively low initial coulombic efficiency, prohibiting its commercial application in DC-LICs. Aravindan et al. induced GC by using vegetable cooking oil as a carbon source (Fig. 9a–d).66 The as-prepared GC displayed a spherically shaped morphology and high purity using a modified catalytic chemical vapor deposition. The configured GC//AC DC-LICs displays a maximum energy density of approximately 108 W h kg−1. In addition, elongated graphitized hollow nanofibers from vegetable oil were also presented by the same group.67 Another example was reported by Guo et al., who described a novel way to catalyze sisal fibers to GC (Fig. 9e–g).20 The plateau capacity was regulated by the degree of ordering of GC, they found that the plateau capacity and degree of graphitization was enlarged by the increasing temperature of the heat-treatment. The sample prepared at 1100 °C possessed a high plateau capacity of 243 mA h g−1 below 0.2 V (68% of the total reversible capacity of 354 mA h g−1 at 0.05 A g−1), a high rate capability (222 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1) and an excellent cycling stability. The DC-LICs device, assembled with GC as a negative electrode displayed high energy densities of 104 W h kg−1 and 32 W h kg−1 at 0.143 kW kg−1 and 6.63 kW kg−1, respectively. The energy density retention reached 94.7% at 0.5 A g−1 and 96.5% at 1 A g−1 after 3000 cycles, revealing an outstanding cyclic stability.

3.2.3 Hard carbon. 
With more rapid kinetics and a larger space gap between the carbon layers than graphite, HC is a desirable candidate for high power LICs.20,32,80 Shi et al. compared the effect of the LICs performance on two different HC materials (spherical HC, irregular HC) with an AC positive electrode, revealing that the irregular HC exhibited an optimal electrochemical performance with a high energy density up to 85.7 W h kg−1 and a power density as high as 7.6 kW kg−1 based on the active material mass of two electrodes in the voltage range of 2.0–4.0 V (Fig. 10).68 They also suggested that the optimal working potential should be below 4.2 V to avoid the oxidative decomposition of the electrolyte. Goikolea and Ajuria obtained a HC negative electrode with an AC positive electrode from recycled olive pits, which demonstrated a remarkable energy and power density enhancement with a superior cyclic performance in LICs.69 In addition, preparation of a HC negative electrode derived from a carbonaceous source, such as a nitrogen-doped carbonized polyimide microsphere (CPIMS),71 can also be a practicable approach. However, the voltage hysteresis and sloping characteristics during the charge/discharge of HC are unfavorable to the cycling stability of LICs. Ma et al. systematically studied the electrochemical performances and capacity fading behaviors of AC//HC LICs and found that the capacity fading of LICs upon cycling was caused by an increase in the internal resistance and the consumption of lithium stored in the negative electrode.81

3.2.4 Graphene. 
Benefiting from superior electron carrier mobility and fast lithium-ion transportation kinetics, graphene is also a potential candidate for DC-LICs negative electrode materials rather than only being utilized as positive electrode materials.6 For example, Zhou and co-workers fabricated pre-lithiated graphene nanosheets as a negative electrode in DC-LICs, delivering a maximum power density of 222.2 W kg−1 at an energy density of 61.7 W h kg−1 with a 74% capacitance retention at 400 mA g−1 after 300 cycles.60 Chen's group demonstrated a highly oriented graphene sponge (HOG) negative electrode with an ultra-high energy density (Fig. 11a–d).70 The obtained AC//HOG-Li LICs showed 3.6 times higher lithium ion diffusivity than AC/CG-Li LICs. As a result, high energy densities of 231.7 at 57 W kg−1 and 131.9 W h kg−1 at 2.8 kW kg−1 were obtained. Recently, Sawangphruk reported a nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) aerogel negative electrode in a DC-LICs system with AC as the positive electrode (Fig. 11e–h).73 In the voltage window of 2.0–4.0 V, the as-prepared LICs exhibited a maximum specific energy of 170.28 W h kg−1 and the maximum power density reached 25.75 kW kg−1 with almost no capacity decay after 2000 cycles.

3.2.5 Carbon-based composite materials. 
Fabricating composites is an effective way to mix different types of carbon materials (graphite, HC, CNTs, CNFs, graphene, carbon nanotubes, etc.) as an active substrate to achieve high performance DC-LICs devices. For instance, Kim and co-workers reported high energy density and high power density DC-LICs by using HC coated with natural graphite as negative materials.78 The as-assembled DC-LICs achieved improved energy and power densities as well as enhanced cycling performance. Furthermore, single-wall carbon nanotubes and a graphene composite with an energy density of 222 W h kg−1 at a power density of 410 W kg−1 were demonstrated by Tang's group.38 Yu and co-workers reported melamine-based carbon/reduced graphene oxide foam, which revealed a significantly superior DC-LICs performance when compared to the fresh materials.75 Hu et al. demonstrated N-rGO chemically bonded with carbon nanotubes (CNTs).65 The energy density of the corresponding DC-LICs reached 124.9 W h kg−1 because of the superior electrical conductivity and well-distributed mesopores and micropores. Other carbon-composite materials were also put forward in LICs, such as pre-lithiated multiwalled carbon nanotube/graphite composites and carbon nanotubes/amorphous carbon composites.74,82

4. Design of DC-LICs
Many factors, including the prelithiation technique, working voltage and mass ratio of the positive electrode to the negative electrode, make a difference to the energy density, power density and cyclic stability. Typically, a flat working potential can be achieved by intercalating Li+ into the graphite interlayer. In this way, reduced electrode resistance, improved energy density as well as stabilized cycling performance can be achieved. In addition, reducing the negative electrode potential can enlarge the working voltage of DC-LICs. According to eqn (1), the energy density can be largely improved. An enlarged energy density can also be achieved by expanding the entire operating voltage of DC-LICs during the electrochemical test. However, the enlarged operating voltage might produce a negative impact which could damage the cyclic stability in the case of it exceeding the electrolyte decomposition potential. Furthermore, the specific capacity of the lithium ion intercalation graphite negative electrode (300–350 mA h g−1) is much higher than that of the AC positive electrode (30–50 mA h g−1) in an organic electrolyte system. As a result, the mass ratio of the positive electrode to the negative electrode (m+/m−) is a very important parameter in achieving capacity balance. Taking the above considerations into account, it is of great significance to obtain a balance between the proper prelithiation level, a suitable working voltage window and the optimal m+/m−.
4.1 Prelithiation strategy
LICs including DC-LICs are normally accompanied by a prelithiation process which ensures the negative electrode works at a relative low potential and provides lithium ions for an insertion/extraction reaction at the negative electrode side. Furthermore, the introduced lithium source can also reduce the electrode resistance and compensate for the irreversible lithium-loss during the cycles which is caused by the formation of solid electrolyte interface films (SEI) on the negative electrode. Several effective prelithiated methods can be summarized as follows (Fig. 12):83,84 (i) electrochemical method (EC); (ii) short circuit prelithiation, including external short circuit (ESC) and internal short (IS) methods; (iii) adding irreversible lithium transition metal oxides (LMO) at the positive electrode side; and (iv) adding sacrificial lithium salt to the electrolyte.

4.1.1 Electrochemical prelithiation. 
For the EC method, Li metal is used as the counter electrode and graphite is employed as a working electrode. Lithium ions transfer from Li metal to graphite and accomplish the prelithiation process via cycling at a relative low current (e.g., C/20), during which the lithium electrode and graphite electrode are electronically isolated from each other (Fig. 12a). After that, the cell is disassembled and the obtained prelithiated graphite electrode is assembled with AC to acquire DC-LICs. Choi et al. achieved prelithiated graphite by cycling the graphite half-cell at 0.1C twice and charging down to 0.05 V for the third cycle.88 Similarly, Shi and co-authors developed prelithiated mesocarbon microbeads (MCMB) by assembling a MCMB working electrode with a lithium reference electrode.89 The merit of this method is that the lithiated content can be accurately controlled by setting the cut-off capacity and producing a stable SEI layer. However, the re-assembling step of the prelithiated negative electrode is a time-consuming process which is not beneficial to the commercial application.


4.1.2 Short circuit prelithiation. 
Typically, short circuit prelithiation can be divided into ESC and IS strategies (Fig. 12b and c). For the ESC method, a sacrificial lithium metal electrode and an aiming electrode (e.g., graphite) that are isolated using a porous polymer separator in a non-aqueous electrolyte, are linked with wire to spontaneously promote lithium-ions interacting into the aiming electrode.90,91 Koo and Zhang compared different prelithiation methods (EC, ESC and IS) and demonstrated that the IS was a fast and efficient pre-doping approach to achieve high energy density DC-LICs (Fig. 13).85 The IS technique is operated by stabilized metallic lithium (e.g., Li metal, Li powder, Li belts) contacting with a carbon negative electrode directly and partially or absolutely into the interlayer in the presence of electrolyte medium. Zheng et al. illustrated a HC/AC LICs system using a mixture of stabilized lithium metal powder (SLMP).80 Furthermore, they also investigated the influence of the Li power loadings of the negative electrode on the performance of the AC/HC DC-LICs system.92 When the mass ratio of HC to SLMP was 5:1–8:1, a stable cycle life was achieved. The extra Li powder protected the SEI layers from etching by hydrogen fluoride (HF). The major advantage of short circuit prelithiation is its elegant simplicity and the potential application for scale-up. However, there are some downsides of this “blind” way. The main drawbacks are the safety considerations and that the amount of lithium cannot be controlled precisely.86

4.1.3 Adding irreversible lithium transition metal oxides at the positive electrode side. 
Compared to using metallic lithium, employing electrochemical irreversible lithium transition metal oxides in an irreversible manner as a prelithiation agent can largely improve the safety of DC-LICs. Typically, the selected lithium transition metal oxides only work on the first charge process to promote the insertion of lithium cations into the graphite negative electrode and do not converse back to the substrate materials in the following discharge process. Up until now, Li6CoO4 (Fig. 14a–d), Li5FeO4 (Fig. 14e–h), Li2CuO2, Li5ReO6 and Li2RuO3 have been developed as this kind of prelithiation agent.93–97 In this way, the prelithiation level can be readily adjusted by controlling the amount of lithium metal oxides in the positive electrode.

4.1.4 Adding sacrificial organic lithium salt. 
Very recently, Brousse et al. reported a “sacrificial organic lithium salt” prelithiation method using 3,4-dihydroxybenzonitrile dilithium salt (Li2DHBN) as a sacrificial salt in 1 M LiPF6/EC–DMC (Fig. 12e).87 The insoluble Li2DHBN was mixed with AC and released to form soluble 3,4-dioxobenzonitrile (DOBN) during the first charge process (Fig. 15). The released Li+ intercalated into graphite to achieve the prelithiation process. This method does not utilize lithium metal and thus improves the safety.

Table 3 compares the advantages and disadvantages of different prelithiation techniques. Among these methods, stabilized metallic lithium powder/belt and adding irreversible lithium transition metal oxides at the positive side may have the most promising prospects for industrial application. Using a stabilized metallic lithium powder/belt it is feasible to carry out prelithiation which is very important for large scale applications and has successfully been achieved in commercial applications. However, accurately controlling the level of lithiation and the safety considerations are also important aspects. It is also an effective way of employing electrochemical irreversible lithium transition metal oxides to achieve a prelithiation target owing to the safety. The problem is finding highly stable and effective metal-oxides or other compounds.

4.2 Mass match principle
For DC-LICs, one of the main fundamental scientific issues is the fact that the high specific capacities of the electrochemical intercalation/deintercalation type electrodes do not match the low specific capacitances of the physical adsorption/desorption type electrodes, making the balance of different electrode materials a challenging job.83 Thus, an appropriate proportion of the positive and negative electrode in the configuration of DC-LICs can largely improve the entire energy density if the capacities of the positive and negative electrode are utilized to the greatest extent. In a DC-LICs system, the total energy can be calculated as follows:5 (7)
In which q is the capacity, m− and C− are the mass and specific capacity (A h g−1) of the negative electrode material, respectively, and Vm and Vc are the maximum potential and operating potential window of the cell, respectively. The highest charge stored in both electrodes is determined by the smallest value of Q+, Q− and Qi, attributed to the charge in the positive electrode, negative electrode and electrolyte, respectively. On one side, the charge that is stored in the positive and the negative electrode (Qelectrode) should be equal and is influenced by the specific capacitance (Celectrode), the mass of active materials (m) and the working potential window (ΔE) according to eqn (8).98 Qelectrode = Celectrode × m × ΔE(8)
Therefore, in order to achieve the principle of charge balance, the mass ratio of the positive and negative electrode should equal the following equation:99 (9)
In which Q is the capacity of the electrode, m means the mass of the active materials and the subscripts “+” and “−” represent the positive and negative electrode, respectively. On the other side, the energy density can also be affected by the electrolyte and the minimum mass electrolyte needed to satisfy the relationship of Qi = Q− = Q+ and deduce the principle of eqn (10).100 mi = αm−(10)
In which mi represents the mass of the electrolyte, and α is calculated using the following eqn (11). α = ρC−/c0F(11)
In which ρ is the mass density of the electrolyte, c0 is assigned to the concentration of the electrolyte and F is equal to the value of Faraday's constant (96484 F mol−1). Therefore, the energy density can be calculated using the following principle. (12)
In which ε is the energy density that can be obtained, and γ represents the mass ratio of . When the DC-LICs achieves the highest energy density, the mass ratio between the negative and positive electrode can be confirmed using the following equation. (13)
In 2008, Béguin's group investigated the mass ratio of AC/graphite and the operating voltage to achieve a balance between the energy and power density. Under optimum conditions, the gravimetric and volumetric energy densities separately reached as high as 103.8 W h kg−1 and 111.8 W h L−1 with a long cycle-life.41 Huang et al. designed high energy density DC-LICs assembled with graphene-based electrodes by controlling the mass ratio of the positive electrode/negative electrode (Fig. 16).101 During the half-cell test, the specific capacity of the positive electrode was 90–80 mA h g−1 in the designed working potential while the negative electrode ranged from 350 to 280 mA h g−1 at different current densities. Therefore, the best mass ratio of the two electrodes (m+/m−) can be calculated as 3.5–4.0 according to eqn (8). Guided by this, the assembled graphene-based DC-LICs showed the highest energy density of 128 W h kg−1.

4.3 Voltage window selection
According to eqn (1), the energy density is influenced by the capacitance and working voltage window. One can widen the working voltage window and enlarge the capacitance to improve the energy density. For the purposes of achieving a high energy density and power density, selecting a proper operating voltage can be adaptable. Benefiting from the different charge storage mechanism of the DC-LICs negative and positive electrode, the operating voltage window can be enlarged, thus achieving a high energy density as well as a high power density. The working voltage of the LICs can reach a higher level of over 4.0 V although the EDLCs are limited at 2.7 V when employing AC as the active material. The stable voltage window is around 1.5–4.5 V versus Li+/Li in an ester-based lithium ion electrolyte.25,102 The electrolyte will gain an electron to be reduced if the working voltage is lower than 1.5 V versus Li+/Li and in turn it will be oxidized if the voltage is higher than 4.5 V versus Li+/Li. It should be noted that a stable and continuous SEI film forms below 0.8 V versus Li+/Li by reduction of the electrolyte during the initial few cycles. This will prevent further decomposition of the electrolyte during the following cycles on the negative electrode.103,104 Therefore, the working voltage below the over-oxidation voltage (4.5 V) for an ester-based electrolyte is adaptable in theory. Further increasing the high-working voltage causes an electrolyte decomposition problem. This is an issue that is particularly important for an electrochemical capacitor being used as a ‘‘power device’’ because it leads to high impedance of the electrode/electrolyte interface and eventually causes a deterioration in the power performance over longer cycling.102,105
Tang et al. explored symmetric graphene as a DC-LICs active material in a three-electrode cell system to investigate the electrochemical behaviors at different charge states.38 The lithium-ions were not fully intercalated into Li-SG when the working voltages were 3.5 V and 3.7 V because the potentials of the Li-SG electrode were around 0.25 and 0.14 V, respectively (Fig. 17a and b). Furthermore, when the operating voltage was enlarged to 4.0 and 4.1 V, the potential of the negative electrode was further reduced to 0.01 V, indicating that lithium-ions were fully intercalated into the negative electrode and thus a higher energy density was achieved (Fig. 17c and d). Shi et al. studied the effects of the utilization of different lithium ion intercalation plateaus of a MCMB negative electrode in DC-LICs, revealing that the utilization of two plateaus greatly affects the charge–discharge behavior at different working potential ranges (Fig. 17e–h).89 By controlling the lithium content in MCMB concisely, the authors found that for LIC150 using the first plateau of the MCMB negative electrode exhibited a higher power density and an enhanced cycle performance, and for LIC300 using the second plateau of the MCMB negative electrode showed a higher energy density. The energy density increased by widening the working voltage window, but the cyclic performance was destroyed when the voltage was enlarged to 4.2 V.

4.4 Electrolyte selection
The electrolyte also acts as an essential part of the DC-LICs coupling with electrodes, significantly affecting the energy density, power density and cycling stability of DC-LICs. Several requirements for electrolyte should be met in order to provide a high energy and power output for DC-LICs, these are:5 (i) an excellent ionic conductivity; (ii) good electronic insulator; (iii) wide working potential window; (iv) superior physical and chemical stability; (v) environmentally friendly and low toxicity. Normally, the electrolyte used in DC-LICs can be classified into four types: (i) aqueous electrolyte; (ii) organic electrolyte; (iii) ionic liquid electrolyte; and (iv) solid-state polymer electrolyte. Aqueous electrolytes are divided into acid, neutral and alkaline solutions. This kind of electrolyte provides a high ionic conductivity and low resistance which is beneficial to ion transfer. However, the working voltage window is largely limited below 1.2 V, and is restricted by water decomposition.28 Recently, ionic liquid-based electrolytes have been studied owing to the advantages of their negligible volatility, high thermal, chemical and electrochemical stability, low flammability, and superior conductivity.106,107 Nevertheless, the rigorous preparation conditions and high cost prohibit their further application. A solid-state polymer electrolyte may be a suitable choice. It is an ionic conducting media but has electronic separators which can improve the safety of LICs. Although solid-state polymer electrolytes have been flourishing in recent years and great progress has been made, the ionic conductivity needs to be largely improved so that they can be utilized at room temperature. For commercially available electrolyte systems, organic electrolytes show the best prospects for DC-LICs. On the one hand, electrolytes used in the organic system supply a wider voltage window than aqueous electrolytes. On the other hand, the working environment of organic electrolytes is more moderate than that of ionic liquid electrolytes and solid-state polymer electrolytes. They have been widely applied in LIBs, SCs as well as LICs. However, organic electrolytes also suffer from several issues such as a higher cost, lower specific capacitance, inferior conductivity, and safety concerns associated with flammability, volatility, and toxicity.106 Recently, Koo introduced a new polyethylene glycol-functionalized polysilsesquioxane, a ladder-like structured poly(poly(ethylene oxide)-co-methacryloxypropyl)silsesquioxane (PEO-SQ) hybrid-type polymer gelator to fabricate hybrid ionogel electrolytes for LICs (Fig. 18).108 The intelligent combination gave the electrolyte an excellent thermal stability (∼400 °C) and superior ionic conductivity, which is favorable for improving the rate and cycling performance of LICs.

Lithium salts, solvents and additives are the most important components of electrolyte systems. Typically, lithium salt can be divided into inorganic and organic types, it is the main resource for lithium-ions. Yokoyama and co-workers demonstrated the effects of different anions and cations in the supporting electrolyte on the storage capacity of DC-LICs, and found that a discharge capacity of 95 mA h g−1 can be obtained when using triethylmethylammonium PF6 (TEMAPF6) because the intercalation of PF6− into graphite occurs during the electrochemical reaction.109 Yoshio investigated the effect of different cations from lithium-ions on four kinds of quaternary alkyl ammonium cations in AC/graphite systems.110 They found that the smaller ionic radius the higher the specific capacitance. The solvents, usually denoted as polycarbonate (PC), ethers, ethylene carbonate (EC), diethyl carbonate (DEC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), propylmethyl carbonate (PMC), ethylmethyl carbonate (EMC), can dissolve lithium salts and transfer lithium-ions.24,41,90,111 The solvents strongly affect the formation and composition of SEI. Balducci developed propylene carbonate (PC) as an electrolyte solvent in soft carbon/AC DC-LICs, revealing that PC was a much safer choice compared to mixtures of organic carbonates.64 As for the additives, they are associated with certain substances that are added into the electrolyte and can effectively improve the performance of DC-LICs. According to the various effects of additives, they can be categorized as: (i) to improve the ions conductivity; (ii) to improve the interface properties (SEI, wettability); (iii) to enhance the performance at low temperature and thermal stability; and (iv) to prevent over charging and decrease the contents of acid and water in the electrolyte.5,112–114
5. Typical DC-LICs
According to the different electrochemical reaction occurring on/in the positive and negative sides of the carbon materials, DC-LICs are classified into asymmetric and symmetric types. The asymmetric DC-LICs consist of a battery-type negative electrode and a capacitor-type positive electrode. Benefiting from this construction, a higher working voltage can be achieved and thus a higher energy density is obtained according to eqn (1). The main problem of asymmetric DC-LICs is that the low kinetics of the battery-type negative electrode does not match the fast kinetics of the capacitor-type positive electrode. Symmetric DC-LICs are a kind of energy storage device which use the same carbon-based active materials on both the positive and negative sides. In this way, the mismatch of kinetic behavior can be prevented somewhat. In asymmetric DC-LICs, the battery-type negative electrode is characterized as a Li-interaction type carbon, such as graphite and HC, and the capacitor-type positive electrode is composed of a high SSA carbon, such as AC. Porous carbon, for which the capacity is largely attributed to the capacitive behavior, has also been widely studied for use as a negative electrode material in high-power LIBs.115,116 Inspired by this, symmetric DC-LICs have been developed, in which the same carbon type is employed as both the positive and negative electrodes, this can be an effective way to compensate the mismatch of the positive and negative electrode on the kinetics to achieve fast ions transfer properties.
5.1 Asymmetric DC-LICs
Asymmetric DC-LICs, such as graphite (−)//AC (+), HC (−)//AC (+), graphite (−)//SFAC (+), and graphitized carbon (−)//AC (+), have been widely studied. Zheng et al. investigated the influence of various types of carbon materials (HC, soft carbon and graphite) on power density and cycling stability of DC-LICs, revealing that the HC negative electrode possessed the highest power density and both HC and soft carbon as negative electrodes displayed a better cycle life than the graphite negative electrode.117 Wang and co-workers demonstrated a typical asymmetric graphitized carbon (−)//AC (+) DC-LICs by introducing the highly porous graphitic carbon (PGCs) negative electrode with graphitization as high as 95.6% which were derived from metalorganic quantum dots (MQDs).118 The assembled PGCs//AC DC-LICs exhibited a maximum energy up to 83.7 W h kg−1 and retention over 97% even after 10000 cycles at 5 A g−1. In their design, the method of in situ catalytic graphitization provided an effective way to realize a high degree of graphitization for the graphitic carbon and thus improve the performance of the DC-LICs.
5.2 Symmetric DC-LICs
Symmetrical LICs exhibit promising prospects for achieving a superior power density and the slow lithium-ion interaction kinetics can be alleviated. In 2009, Kim et al. employed MnO2-CNTs as positive and negative electrodes and reported the first study concerning symmetric LICs composed of two metal oxide electrodes with SLMP placed at the positive electrode.119 After that, other symmetric LICs devices were also demonstrated, such as mesoporous TiN microspheres, graphene-TiN, and graphene/MoO2.120–122 For the symmetrical DC-LICs, Xia et al. developed novel B, N-doped carbon nanofibers (BNC) as both the negative and positive electrode materials for LICs (Fig. 19a–e).123 This novel 4.5 V “dual carbon” BNC//BNC LICs transferred a large energy density of 220 W h kg−1 and a high power density of 22.5 kW kg−1 (at 104 W h kg−1) with an excellent cycling stability (≈81% retention after 5000 cycles). In addition, Lu et al. designed a high-energy 4.5 V DC-LICs with nitrogen doped carbon nanospheres (ANCS) as electrode materials (Fig. 19f–l).124 The resulting DC-LICs delivered energy densities of 206.7 and 115.4 W h kg−1 separately at power densities of 0.225 and 22.5 kW kg−1. Only 0.0013% capacitance decay per cycle within 10000 cycles was observed. Furthermore, Tour's group reported graphene–CNT carpet composite materials as symmetrical electrodes in DC-LICs, which delivered an energy density as high as 29 W h kg−1 at a power density of 20.5 kW kg−1.125 Wang et al. employed a sorghum core as a precursor to obtain porous carbon sheets as electrode materials in symmetric DC-LICs which demonstrated a high energy density of 124.8 W h kg−1.126 Ajuria et al. demonstrated graphene-based positive and negative electrode materials in DC-LICs with a high gravimetric energy and power density.127 Furthermore, microporous carbide derived carbon, symmetric HCN//HCN devices and AC with single-walled carbon nanotube composites were also employed as both positive and negative electrode materials in DC-LICs.128–130

6. Commercialization of DC-LICs
Overall, the polyacenic semiconductor (PAS) has played an important role in the commercial process of LICs. In 1987, the interaction behavior of lithium-ions into PAS was reported by Yata.131 After that, PAS-based capacitors were widely investigated and the working voltage increased from 2.5 V to 3.3 V with an evident elevation of the energy density.132,133 In 2005, Fuji Heavy Industry commercialized LICs based on a prelithiated PAS negative electrode and a porous carbon positive electrode using a laminated structure. Then, several related companies made significant efforts toward the commercialization of LICs based on different technology roadmaps, such as Advanced Capacitor Technologies, JM Energy Corporation, FDK Lithium Ion Capacitor Co., Ltd, TAIYO YUDEN Co., Ltd, General Capacitor Intl, Inc., and Ling Rong New Energy Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd (Table 4).83,102 The energy density of the recently commercialized LICs products can reach up to 10–18 W h kg−1 with a cyclic stability of over 50000 cycles. It should be noted that the energy density of commercial LICs designed by General Capacitor Intl, Inc. achieved 18 W h kg−1 with a laminate structure and the output power density was as high as 7.5 kW kg−1. As for the long cycle life, the products fabricated by JM Energy Corporation achieved 800000 cycles in testing. In respect of the industrialization of DC-LICs, the cylindrical 21700 LICs assembled with active carbon (AC, YP50F) as a positive electrode material and MCMB as the negative electrode material were successfully designed and developed by our group in cooperation with Greenway (Shenzhen) Electronic Co., Ltd. The cylindrical 21700 LICs displayed a low self-discharge rate and excellent charge and discharge characteristics. At the working voltage of 2–4 V, it delivered a capacitance of 333 F, a gravimetric energy density (based on the entire weight of the device) of 10.7 W h kg−1, a volumetric energy density of 22.2 W h L−1, and a capacity retention ratio of 91.7% after 50000 cycles.

7. Summary and perspectives
In summary, the recent progress in DC-LICs has been summarized with a focus on the cell design, working mechanisms, electrode materials and electrolyte systems. Despite the aforementioned impressive progress, several related areas need to be improved such as the sufficient energy density, stable working voltage range, and long cycle lifespan for application in large-scale energy storage devices. Some perspectives and opportunities for future work are summarized as follows for the purpose of achieving improved electrochemical performance.
The critical scientific issues in DC-LICs cannot be ignored, such as the effects of the mismatch of the positive and negative electrodes on the kinetics, the capacity balancing issues of different electrode materials and the prelithiation strategy.83 Focusing on these problems, several significant areas should be studied and this will provide us with more opportunities. For example, the kinetic mismatch of the positive and negative electrodes results in an asymmetric energy density and power density, meaning that when the power density increases the energy density decreases. To solve this mismatched kinetics behavior of the low kinetics being assigned to the negative electrode and fast kinetics to the capacitive electrodes, the development of negative electrode materials with fast ion interactions/deinteractions could be the optimal choice. For example using nanocrystallization or morphological control to decrease the size, surface modification to improve the electrical conductivity and the conductivity of ions, utilizing heteroatom doping strategies and forming composites with other materials. On the other hand, the specific capacitance of the positive electrode should be dramatically improved using the following strategies: proper size distribution with a high SSA, introduction of other elements, structural design and developing other porous carbon materials from biomass or organic precursors. Last but not least, a novel strategy to achieve prelithiation efficiently should be explored to overcome the current defects and to improve the above mentioned methods to make them available for scale-up for further commercial applications.
When it comes to the electrode materials of DC-LICs, it is necessary to develop high performance positive/negative electrode materials. For the negative part, a low working potential, high plateau capacity and superior rate properties are favorable for enhanced DC-LICs performance. The relative low potential can provide a high working voltage window and thus gain a high energy density for the DC-LICs. On the other hand, a high plateau capacity maintains a stable lithium-ions interaction potential which can ensure the cyclic stability. Furthermore, a preferable rate capacity, which can largely compensate the mismatch of the negative electrode and positive electrode on the kinetics, is also indispensable. Taking the above considerations into account, graphitic carbon, together with moderate doping of heteroatoms, adjusts the defects and appropriate functional groups which can provide fast ion transfer properties, and could be the most promising candidates for negative electrode materials in DC-LICs. However, the low initial coulombic efficiency of graphitic carbon should be taken into account. For the carbon positive electrode materials, the specific capacitance needs to be improved for the purposes of accelerating the entire energy density of DC-LICs. Porous carbon with a controllable size distribution and a higher specific capacity is preferred to replace AC such as graphene-based porous carbon, porous CNTs or carbon nanofibers. In any case, the electrolyte cannot be ignored as it is a significant component in high-energy/power density DC-LICs systems. The concentration of ions and the ionic conductivity should be further improved in order to pursue a higher energy density and is the most promising way to perfect the DC-LICs system.
