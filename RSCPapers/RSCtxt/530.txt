    , Accepted 3rd March 2011First published on 30th March 2011AbstractA novel series of organic dyes containing a fluorene unit as the conjunction bridge (S1–S4) have been designed and synthesized for a potential application in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Their absorption spectra, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties have been investigated in detail. The tuning of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels can be conveniently realized by alternating the donor moiety. As demonstrated, the indoline unit can exhibit a stronger electron donating ability, realizing a broader absorption spectrum when coated onto TiO2. The incorporation of octyl-substituted fluorene is highly beneficial to prevent close π–π aggregation, thus favorably suppressing charge recombination and intermolecular interaction. In both the HOMO and LUMO orbitals, the electron density located at the conjunction bridge (fluorene unit) is quite low, suggesting that the incorporated fluorene unit plays quite a small role in the electron delocalization between the donor and acceptor units due to the twist conformation. The overall conversion efficiencies (η) of DSSCs based on these dyes are in the range of 3.04 to 4.26% and highly dependent upon their donor moiety. Among these dyes, S3, which utilizes a methyl-substituted indoline moiety as an electron donor, has shown a maximum monochromatic incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of almost 90%, with a relatively high open circuit voltage (Voc) of 727 mV.

Broader context
The energy crisis, the most important issue we are facing today, has attracted worldwide attention in the search for new technology to provide clean and sustainable renewable energy. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted considerable attention due to their low-cost, facile modification and priority in the use of a large portion of sun irradiation. However, organic dyes are prone to aggregate upon adsorbtion onto TiO2 films. In this article, the alkyl-functionalized fluorene unit was introduced as a π-conjunction bridge (dyesS1–S4) to suppress charge recombination and intermolecular interaction while further improving solubility. The incorporation of an octyl-substituted fluorene unit shows several favorable characteristics for improved light-harvesting and efficiency: (i) it prevents close π–π aggregation, thus favorably suppressing charge recombination and intermolecular interaction when adsorbed onto TiO2, resulting in a relatively high Voc; (ii) it is capable of reducing the thickness of the TiO2 layer, resulting in a large suppression of dark current and therefore an increase in photovoltage; (iii) it exhibits a relatively high molar coefficient in CH2Cl2 and an obviously broad profile upon adsorbtion onto transparent TiO2, which is distinctly beneficial to light-harvesting.

Introduction
Increasingly serious energy problems, along with prominent global warming, have led to widespread concern for renewable energy.1 Among possible alternates, DSSCs based on Ru-complex dyes have been reported with a high photoelectric conversion yield (η) of almost 12.0% under standard AM 1.5 sun light irradiation.2 However, the large-scale application of Ru-complexes has become a critical problem due to limited resources and the hefty purification steps needed.3 Compared with Ru-complexes, metal-free organic dyes have been extensively developed due to their facile modification, high molar coefficient, low cost and relatively high efficiency.4 Generally, the HOMO and LUMO orbitals of solar cell sensitizers should match the corresponding energy levels of the I−/I3−redox potential and conduction band (ECB) of the TiO2 electrode to ensure dye regeneration and an efficient electron injection.5 In addition, efficient light-harvesting as well as the inhibition of intermolecular π–π aggregation and charge recombination can be realized through effective molecular design in sensitizer structures.5a Recently, a variety of metal-free organic dyes such as coumarin,6indoline,7triphenylamine,8tetrahydroquinoline9 and carbazole10 have been employed as the electron donor unit with good performance. Although an introduced π-conjugation system can distinctly red-shift the absorption band, it can also induce unfavorable π-stacked dye aggregation. To weaken or avoid the aggregation from a strong intermolecular π–π interaction, some co-adsorbents such as deoxycholic acid (DCA) or chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) have often been utilized when fabricating devices.5a,10a On the other hand, steric structures such as alkyl substituted aniline and thiophene units were introduced to inhibit possible intermolecular aggregation and retard the electron transfer from TiO2 to the oxidized dye or electrolyte, thus enhancing Voc.10a,11

Fluorene derivatives are well known as promising optical materials due to their attractive electrochemical and optical properties as well as their excellent hole-transporting abilities.12 Grätzel et al. have proved that the bis-dimethylfluoreneaniline moieties, acting as an electron donating group, enhance stability to heat and light as well as inhibiting aggregation.13 In particular, two long alkyl chains on the 9-position of the fluorene unit can be expected to favorably suppress charge recombination and intermolecular interaction and further improve solubility. Bearing this in mind, a novel series of organic dyes containing aniline derivatives as the electron donor, 2-cyanoacrylic acid as the electron acceptor and anchoring group, and thienylfluorene as the π-conjugated bridge (S1–S4, shown in Fig. 1) have been designed and synthesized for a potential application in DSSCs. Their structure–performance relationships were studied, especially the effect of the fluorene unit and donor moieties upon the photophysical, photochemical, electrochemical properties and solar-cell performances. As expected, the tuning of the HOMO level could be achieved through the choice of a suitable donor group. Our results indicate that the indoline unit as the donor shows better photovoltaic performance due to the higher electron capability, resulting in relatively high molar extinction. Moreover, the incorporation of the octyl-substituted fluorene unit helps to inhibit sensitizer aggregation when adsorbed onto TiO2, resulting in relatively high Voc.

Experimental
Materials and reagents
Unless otherwise stated, starting materials were used as commercially purchased and without any further purification. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was pre-dried over 4 Å molecular sieves and distilled under argon atmosphere from sodium benzophenone ketyl immediately prior to use. Tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) was vacuum-dried for 48 h. The commercially transparent FTO conducting glass (fluorine-doped SnO2, transmission >90% in the visible range, sheet resistance 15 Ω m−2), purchased from Geao Science and Educational Co. Ltd., was washed with a basic solution, ethanol, and acetone successively under supersonication for 10 min before use. Commercial TiO2 (P 25) was used for the preparation of the nanocrystalline films. The intermediates of 2,7-dibromo-9,9-dioctyl-9H-fluorene,14bromination and boronic acid of triphenylamine, indoline derivatives and N,N-dimethyl benzenamine15 were synthesized according to their corresponding literatures. Octyl-substituted fluorene units and thiophene as the conjunction bridges were attached to the donor moiety by a conventional Suzuki cross-coupling with a relatively high yield.16
Equipment

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AM500 or AM400 spectrometer with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard, operating at 500 and 100 MHz, respectively. HRMS were recorded with ESI mass spectroscopy. The UV-Vis spectra were measured with a model CARY 100 spectrophotometer. The cyclic voltammograms of the dyes were obtained with a Versastat II electrochemical workstation (Princeton Applied Research) using 0.1 M TBAPF6 (Aldrich) as the supporting electrolyte, a sensitizer attached to a 7 μm nanocrystalline TiO2 film deposited on conducting FTO glass as the working electrode, a platinum wire as the counter electrode, and a regular calomel electrode in saturated KCl solution as the reference electrode in acetonitrile. The scan rate was 100 mV s−1.
Photovoltaic measurements employed an AM 1.5 solar simulator equipped with a 300 W xenon lamp (model no. 91160, Oriel). The power of the simulated light was calibrated to 100 MW cm−2 using a Newport Oriel PV reference cell system (model 91150 V). I–V curves were obtained by applying an external bias to the cell and measuring the generated photocurrent with a model 2400 source meter (Keithley Instruments, Inc. USA). The voltage step and delay time of the photocurrent were 10 mV and 40 ms, respectively. The cell active area was tested with a mask of 0.1589 cm2. The photocurrent action spectra were measured with the incident monochromatic photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) test system consisting of a model SR830 DSP Lock-In Amplifier and model SR540 Optical Chopper (Stanford Research Corporation, USA), a 7IL/PX150 xenon lamp and power supply and a 7ISW301 spectrometer.
Fabrication of solar cells
Two types of TiO2 paste were used as photoelectrodes by screen-printing to scrutinize and optimize the TiO2 parameter on current–voltage characteristics of S1–S4. Transparent TiO2, comprising of nanoparticles (∼15 nm), and light-scattering of anatase particles comprising of large particles (∼200 nm) were prepared using ethyl cellulose as a binder and α-terpineol as a solvent. Films A and B were fabricated with 3 and 7 μm transparent TiO2; while films C, D and E were fabricated with 3, 7 and 10 μm transparent TiO2 and then 6 μm scattering TiO2 by screen-printing. After they were completely dried with infrared light, the films were sintered in a muffle furnace at 275 °C, 325 °C and 375 °C for 5 min and 450 °C and 500 °C for 15 min, respectively. Before being immersed in the dye solution, these films were soaked in a 0.2 M aqueous TiCl4 solution overnight in a closed chamber. After being washed with deionized water and fully rinsed with ethanol, the films were heated again at 450 °C for 30 min, followed by cooling to 80 °C and dipping into a 3 × 10−4 M solution of the dyesS1–S4 (with or without CDCA) in CH2Cl2 for 12 h at room temperature. The counter electrode was prepared by sputtering with two drops of 0.02 M H2PtCl6 in 2-propanol solution followed by annealing treatment at 400 °C for 15 min. The dye-coated TiO2 electrode as the working electrode and Pt coated transparent conductive oxide (TCO) glass as the counter electrode were assembled into a sealed sandwich-type cell by heating with a hot-melt ionomer film (Surlyn 1702, DuPont). The redox electrolyte was injected through a pre-drilled hole in the counter electrode by capillary force and driven into the cell by means of vacuum backfilling. Finally, the hole was sealed using a UV-melt gum and a cover glass. The electrolyte was composed of 0.1 M lithium iodide, 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium iodide (BMII), 0.05 M I2 and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (4-TBP) in acetonitrile.

Results and discussion
Synthesis

Fluorene derivatives have been widely used as blue light emitters in polymer light-emitting diodes (PLED) due to their attractive electrochemical and optical properties and effective hole-transporting capability.16 Notably, the steric structure of the fluorene unit with two hydrophobic long alkyl chains on the 9-position can form a tightly packed insulating monolayer to prevent the hydrophilic I3− from approaching the TiO2 surface, thereby retarding the charge recombination processes of injected electrons with I3− ions in the electrolyte, which is the main decreasing factor for Voc.10e Accordingly, we incorporated the fluorene unit with two octyl groups on the 9-position as the conjunction bridge into the traditional Donor-π-Acceptor (D-π-A) system. As illustrated in Scheme 1, the target dyesS1, S2, S3 and S4 were conveniently prepared by a conventional Suzuki cross-coupling and Knoevenagel condensation reactions. The Suzuki coupling between the intermediate, 3, and the corresponding boronic acid of the donor units was carried out using Pd(PPh3)4 as a catalyst in a mixture of 2 M aqueous K2CO3 and THF under reflux conditions to give the corresponding intermediate 4. It was reacted with 5-formylthiophen-2-ylboronic acid through a Suzuki coupling reaction to provide the corresponding formylated intermediate 5, this was then reacted with cyanoacteic acid in the presence of piperidine as a catalyst in acetonitrile under reflux to give the four target sensitizers. Their chemical structures were fully characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and HRMS.

Absorption properties in solution and when adsorbed onto TiO2 film
The UV-vis absorption spectra in CH2Cl2 and when adsorbed onto 7 μm transparent TiO2 films of the dyesS1–S4 are shown in Fig. 2, and the corresponding data is listed in Table 1. As a typical D-π-A system, the absorption band in the range of 420–440 nm arises from the intramolecular charge transition (ICT) with a high molar extinction (ε = 2.32–3.15 × 104 M−1 cm−1). The maximal absorption wavelength of the four dyes is decreased in the order of S2 > S3 > S4 > S1, indicating that the donor indoline unit can exhibit a better absorption performance compared to triphenylamine and N,N-dimethylphenyl units. The absorption band of S2 shows a slight red-shift compared with S3 due to the effect of the methoxy group.17 As summarized in Table 1, the molar extinction coefficient of S2 is determined to be 31500 M−1 cm−1, which is about 1.34, 1.05 and 1.20 times the corresponding values of S1, S3 and S4, respectively, in the visible region, which is indicative of the superiority of an indoline donor in light harvesting. However, when incorporating the fluorene unit with two octyl groups in the 9-position as the conjunction bridge into a D-π-A system, the influence of the donor group on the absorption spectra of S1–S4 becomes much less than the dyes with isophorone as the conjunction bridge.18 Moreover, compared with the reference compound LS-1 (λmax at 483 nm), the incorporation of an octyl-substituted fluorene unit in the sensitizer S3 results in a blue-shift of almost 50 nm.

To explain the phenomenon, we optimized the geometries of the sensitizers S1–S4 by the Gaussian 03 program. Their optimized ground-state geometries are shown in Fig. 3 and the dihedral angles between the main aromatic rings are listed in Table 2. For S1–S4, the dihedral angles formed between the donor moiety and fluorene plane (Angle-1) are predicted to be 35.2°, 36.0°, 36.2° and 34.9°, respectively, while the dihedral angles formed between the thiophene and fluorene plane (Angle-2) are computed to be 23.5°, 23.5°, 23.2° and 23.7°. With the two torsion angles of about 35° and 23°, the incorporated fluorene unit may break the delocalization or conjugation between the donor and acceptor.19

To scrutinize the charge transfer on excitation, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G* level.6a As illustrated in Fig. 4, the HOMO orbital in S1–S4 is primarily located at the π-framework of the donor part, while the electron density of the LUMO is delocalized over the thiophene group and anchoring group. Thus, the excitation from the HOMO to the LUMO orbital can move the electron distribution from the donor unit to the anchoring moiety to realize electron injection to the conduction band of TiO2. However, in both the HOMO and LUMO orbital, the electron density located at the conjunction bridge (fluorene unit) is quite low, suggesting the incorporated fluorene unit plays quite a low role in the electron delocalization between the donor and the acceptor due to the above mentioned twist conformation.

When adsorbed onto 7 μm transparent TiO2, S1, S2, S3 and S4 exhibits a small red-shift (24, 27, 23 and 15 nm, respectively) in absorption with respect to measurements taken in CH2Cl2 solution (Table 1). While compound LS-1, without octyl-fluorene as the conjunction bridge, exhibits a much larger blue shift (almost 63 nm). Generally, when sensitizers are anchored onto a nanocrystalline TiO2 surface, the deprotonation and H-aggregates always result in a blue-shift, while J-aggregates mainly lead to a red-shift. Since the introduction of alkyl substituted fluorene, which is beneficial to the inhibition of dye aggregation, the blue-shift in the absorption spectra after being adsorbed onto a TiO2 film might be predominated by the interaction of the anchoring groups with surface titanium ions, namely by deprotonation. It is noteworthy that the absorption spectra of those adsorbed onto transparent TiO2 show a markedly broad profile, which is beneficial to light-harvesting.
Electrochemical properties

Fig. 5 depicts the typical cyclic voltammogram of S1–S4, measured with four sensitizers attached to a 7 μm nanocrystalline TiO2 film deposited on conducting FTO glass in CH3CN containing 0.1 M TBAPF6 as the supporting electrolyte with a 0.1 V s−1 scan rate. Due to the oxidation of their respective aniline derivatives (the donor unit), S1, S2, S3 and S4 show a redox couple at 0.93, 0.64, 0.73 and 0.82 V vs.NHE (Table 1), corresponding to the HOMO level. The HOMO level energies are in the order of S2 > S3 > S4 > S1, indicative of the stronger electron donating ability of the indoline unit.18 Here, all the HOMO values are more positive than that of I3−/I−, ensuring the thermodynamic regeneration of dyes . Moreover, the existence of the methoxy group shifts the oxidation potential (0.64 V vs.NHE) of S2 by 0.09 V cathodically with respect to S3 (Table 1). The LUMO orbital plays an important role in the electron injection process, from sensitizers to TiO2, and can be calculated by the equation, LUMO = HOMO − E0–0. As estimated from the absorption threshold of these dyes adsorbed onto TiO2 films, the resulting E0–0 is 2.17, 2.01, 2.05 and 2.19 eV for S1, S2, S3 and S4, respectively (Table 1). Consequently, all the LUMO values of these dyes (−1.24, −1.37, −1.32 and −1.37 V, respectively) are more negative than the conduction band (ECB) of TiO2, thus ensuring the efficient electron injection from the LUMO orbital of these sensitizers to the conduction band of TiO2.

Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs
To maximize the device performance, dozens of DSSCs were fabricated by employing different TiO2 films with the dye, S3. As illustrated in Fig. 6, the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) is increased from 6.61 to 7.17 mA cm−2 when changing the TiO2 film thickness from 3.0 to 7.0 μm, which also decreases the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) due to the dye aggregation on the TiO2 surface area, which can provide additional charge-recombination sites and enhance the dark current.2a When adding a 6 μm scattering TiO2 layer, the same phenomenon is also observed, where the Jsc increased from 6.71 mA cm−2 (Film C) to 8.75 mA cm−2 (Film E) while the Voc decreased from 756 to 678 mV (Table 3, Fig. 6). With the same nanocrystalline TiO2, the additional scattering TiO2 layer is utilized to avoid the reflection and absorption losses in the TCO substrate. As a matter of fact, the fabrication of scattering TiO2 can increase both Jsc and η, along with a decrease in Voc (Table 3). Typically, with 7 μm nanocrystalline TiO2 (film D), dyeS3 shows a relatively high Voc of 727 mV with the best overall conversation.

Generally, for the sensitizer with a strong π-conjugation system, CDCA is needed as a coadsorbent to hinder dye aggregation.10a However, the coadsorption of CDCA also decreases dye coverage on the TiO2 surface. Besides, a large amount of CDCA has been proved to leave protons on the TiO2, resulting in a loss in Voc.6b To study the effect of an incorporated alkyl substituted fluorene unit on dye aggregation, the I–V curves of S1–S4 with a variety of CDCA concentrations (without CDCA, 1.5 mM CDCA and 3 mM CDCA) were measured with film D (Table 4). In the case of S3, with an increase from 0 to 3 mM CDCA, the Jsc decreased from 8.23 to 4.97 mA cm−2, indicating that there was no significant π-aggregation with S3 on the surface of the TiO2 film due to its twisted nonplanar conformation as well as the existence of the two long octyl chains on the 9-position of fluorene unit, which is consistent with the optimized ground-state geometries of S3 (Fig. 3). Accordingly, although the large planar fluorene unit, which acts as the conjunction bridge, cannot increase the electron delocalization and shift to a longer absorption wavelength, the two octyl groups on the 9-position of fluorene can be beneficial in preventing close π–π aggregation, thus favorably suppressing charge recombination and intermolecular interaction.

Moreover, Voc decreases with the increase in the thickness of nanocrystalline TiO2 and the coadsorption of DCA.5 Relatively thin TiO2 with a low concentration of CDCA is feasible due to the incorporation of a steric octyl on the 9-position of fluorene, thus resulting in high Voc. The IPCE action spectra of DSSCs sensitized with S1–S4 were further studied with 7 μm single layer nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes (Fig. 7). Among the four dyes, the cell based on the sensitization of S3 exhibited the highest Jsc owing to its higher IPCE in the visible region. The onset wavelength of the IPCE spectra for both S2 and S3 was located at almost 640 nm, red shifted by 35 nm with respect to S1 and S4, which is consistent with the absorption spectra when adsorbed onto TiO2 films. The IPCE values exceeded higher than 60% in the range of 340–490 nm with a maximum value of almost 90% at 380 nm for the DSSC based on S3. The DSSCs based on S3 exhibited a maximum solar energy to electricity conversion efficiency (η) of 4.26% (Jsc = 8.23 mA cm−2, Voc = 727 mV, ff = 0.71) under simulated AM 1.5 solar light irradiation (100 mW cm−2, Table 4). Under the same conditions, the corresponding values for N719 were Jsc = 12.26 mA cm−2, Voc = 670 mV, ff = 0.63 and η = 5.21%. Obviously, the Voc of S3 is even higher than that of N719, and the η reached almost 82% of a standard device fabricated with N719 measured under the same conditions.

Conclusions
In summary, four organic sensitizers (S1–S4) containing fluorene and thiophene as conjunction bridges have been synthesized for potential application in DSSCs. As demonstrated, the indoline unit can exhibit a stronger electron donating ability, showing better photovoltaic performance with respect to dyes with triphenylamine and N,N-dimethylbenzenamine as donors. Although the large planar fluorene unit, which acts as the conjunction bridge cannot increase the electron delocalization and shift to a longer absorption wavelength due to the rigid structure, the two octyl groups on the 9-position of fluorene can be beneficial in preventing close π–π aggregation, thus favorably suppressing charge recombination and intermolecular interaction. The incorporation of an octyl-substituted fluorene unit shows several favorable characteristics for light-harvesting and efficiency: (i) it is beneficial to prevent close π–π aggregation, thus favorably suppressing charge recombination and intermolecular interaction when adsorbed onto TiO2, resulting in a relatively high Voc; (ii) it is capable of reducing the thickness of the TiO2 layer, greatly suppressing the dark current and hence increasing the photovoltage; (iii) it exhibits a relatively high molar coefficient in CH2Cl2 and a notably broad profile upon adsorbtion onto transparent TiO2, which is distinctly beneficial for light-harvesting. Among these dyes, S3, utilizing a methyl-substituted indoline moiety as the electron donor, has shown a maximum monochromatic incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of almost 90%, with a relatively high open circuit voltage (Voc) of 727 mV and a η of 4.26%, almost 82% of a standard device fabricated with N719 measured under the same conditions.

Broader context
The energy crisis, the most important issue we are facing today, has attracted worldwide attention in the search for new technology to provide clean and sustainable renewable energy. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted considerable attention due to their low-cost, facile modification and priority in the use of a large portion of sun irradiation. However, organic dyes are prone to aggregate upon adsorbtion onto TiO2 films. In this article, the alkyl-functionalized fluorene unit was introduced as a π-conjunction bridge (dyesS1–S4) to suppress charge recombination and intermolecular interaction while further improving solubility. The incorporation of an octyl-substituted fluorene unit shows several favorable characteristics for improved light-harvesting and efficiency: (i) it prevents close π–π aggregation, thus favorably suppressing charge recombination and intermolecular interaction when adsorbed onto TiO2, resulting in a relatively high Voc; (ii) it is capable of reducing the thickness of the TiO2 layer, resulting in a large suppression of dark current and therefore an increase in photovoltage; (iii) it exhibits a relatively high molar coefficient in CH2Cl2 and an obviously broad profile upon adsorbtion onto transparent TiO2, which is distinctly beneficial to light-harvesting.
