    , Accepted 14th October 2022First published on 14th October 2022AbstractMetal oxide catalysts have been widely used in steam reforming of methanol (SRM), but they face the challenge of long-term running. Herein, we report a ZnCeZrOx catalyst that can operate in SRM stably at 400 °C. The H2 production rates of Zn1CeyZr9Ox catalysts are estimated to be in the range of 103.8 to 109.5 μmolH2 gcat−1 s−1 with methanol conversion rates varying in the range of 93.6% to 99.8% at a WHSV of 4.5 h−1. The enhanced activity and stability of the ZnZrOx solid solution catalyst is mainly attributed to the large number of oxygen vacancies for water activation and the stable solid solution structure induced by Ce doping. This work indicates that matched rates for H2O and methanol activation are essential in SRM.
Introduction
Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) as hydrogen-based electrical power sources are promising for stationary, transportation and portable power applications.1,2 However, the main obstacle for the widespread use of PEMFCs at present is the storage and transportation of hydrogen fuel.3 Fortunately, on-site hydrogen production from steam reforming of liquid fuels can overcome these difficulties.4 Methanol is attractive in H2 production because it has a high H/C ratio and in particular can be produced from captured CO2 and solar-derived H2 through a carbon-neutral pathway.5–8
SRM is one of the most important reactions in hydrogen production.9,10 Generally, the SRM reformate is mainly composed of H2, CO2, CO and others, but CO is a toxic poison to the Pt electrode of PEMFCs.11 The separation and purification of H2 could be achieved with a Pd-membrane reactor with an operating temperature of ∼400 °C to avoid the membrane degradation.12,13 Cu- and noble metal-based catalysts are not suitable for long-term running in high temperature steam reforming of methanol due to the aggregation of active metal nanoparticles at high temperatures.14–16 Moreover, both Cu- and noble metal-based catalysts cannot prevent CO formation especially at high temperatures because of the reverse water-gas shift reaction (rWGS).17–20 Thus, metal oxide catalysts with a relatively lower rWGS activity are used for SRM.21–25 However, metal oxide catalysts still face the problem of deactivation under high temperatures because of surface carbon deposition and structure transformation during the SRM process.26,27
The decomposition of methanol on metal oxide catalysts is the main reason for carbon deposition during the SRM process.28 Normally, carbon deposition during the reforming process could be suppressed by introducing more steam into the reaction system.29 However, this increases the energy consumption due to the endothermic property of the carbon elimination reactions and the excessive amount of unreacted steam. H2O activation and dissociation play an important role in SRM.25,30 Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that promoting the H2O dissociation activity may help to suppress carbon deposition. Previous studies suggest that water is mainly activated at oxygen vacancies (Ov) of metal oxide catalysts.31–33 To this end, we have tried to increase the water activation ability and structural stability of metal oxide catalysts. The formation of a mixed metal oxide with Ce is an efficient method to generate Ov because ceria oxide with excellent redox properties (Ce4+/Ce3+) enables easy oxygen exchange through oxygen vacancies, which not only improves the structure stability of the catalysts but also avoids carbon accumulation.34–38
Herein, we report the preparation of ternary ZnCeZrOx catalysts for SRM and the effects of Ce doping on the performance and durability of these catalysts. The results show that the Ce-doped ZnCeZrOx is more active and stable than ZnZrOx in SRM, which is mainly attributed to the high stability of its solid solution structure, its high H2O activation activity and less surface carbon deposition.
Experimental
Chemicals
Methanol (99.8%), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, and ammonium hydroxide were purchased from Kermel. Zr(NO3)4·5H2O was purchased from Macklin. ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O was purchased from Aladdin. Ce(NO3)3·6H2O was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. China. All the above chemicals were of analytical purity and used as received.
Catalyst preparation
The Zn1CeyZr9Ox catalysts were synthesized via a wet-impregnation method using CeZr(OH)x as a support. In a typical process, CeZr(OH)x was first prepared by a precipitation method using ammonia as a precipitation reagent. Ammonia (10 vol%) was added quickly to an aqueous solution of Zr(NO3)4·5H2O (0.16 mol L−1) and Ce(NO3)3·6H2O at 70 °C under stirring to adjust the pH value to ∼8.3. CeZr(OH)x was obtained after washing thoroughly with distilled water and dried at 100 °C overnight. Then an aqueous solution (0.5 mL) with a specific amount of dissolved Zn(NO3)2·6H2O was added dropwise to CeZr(OH)x powder (2 g). After being kept at room temperature for 6 h, the wet powder was dried at 100 °C in an oven overnight. Then, the powder was calcined at 500 °C for 4 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 to afford Zn1CeyZr9Ox, where y and x denote the molar amounts of Ce and O, respectively. CeZrOx catalysts were obtained by calcination of CeZr(OH)x in air with the same temperature program as Zn1CeyZr9Ox. Zn1Ce10Ox was synthesized via the same procedure as Zn1CeyZr9Ox and the only difference was using Ce(OH)3 as a support.
The Zn1Zr10Ox catalyst was prepared using a similar method to Zn1CeyZr9Ox catalysts except that a Zr(OH)4 support was used instead of CeZr(OH)x. Zr(OH)4 was prepared by dissolving 6.93 g ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O and 18 g urea in 50 mL MeOH. Then the mixture was transferred to an autoclave and heated at 160 °C for 12 h. The obtained precipitates were washed thoroughly with MeOH and dried at 100 °C overnight.39
Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a Rigaku D/Max 2500/PC diffractometer with a Cu Kα (λ = 0.154 nm) radiation source. The specific surface area was determined by means of nitrogen sorption isotherms using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were performed using a JEOL JEM-F200. The samples were dispersed in ethanol and then dropped onto a Cu grid, finally allowing the solvent to evaporate. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) analysis was conducted with an ICPS-8100. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded using a Bruker A200 spectrometer at room temperature. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250Xi instrument with an Al Kα radiation source (hν = 1486.6 eV). In situ Raman spectroscopy was employed over Zn1Zr10Ox, Ce1Zr9Ox and Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox. The samples were initially reduced in H2 for 1 h at 400 °C. The H2 reduction spectra were recorded at 400 °C. After sweeping with Ar, the substrate was introduced to the catalyst cell via Ar bubbling at 400 °C, and the spectra were collected online. The effluent gases including MeOH (31), H2O (18), H2 (2), CO2 (44), CH4 (16), CO (28), HCHO (30), HCOOH (45), and HCOOCH3 (60) were detected by mass spectrometry (MS). Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in air using a NETZSCH STA-449F3 thermogravimetric analyzer. Temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) tests were carried out after the catalysts were pre-reduced in H2 at 400 °C for 1 h followed by cooling down to room temperature. After that, the substrate (H2O or H2O/MeOH 1.0) was introduced to the catalyst cell via Ar bubbling (20 mL min−1) with the temperature ramping up (5 °C min−1) from 20 °C to 400 °C. The effluent gases including MeOH (31), H2O (18), H2 (2), CO2 (44), CH4 (16), CO (28), HCHO (30), HCOOH (45) and HCOOCH3 (60) were detected by mass spectrometry (OmniStar).
Catalytic activity measurement
SRM catalytic tests were performed in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor (6 mm i.d.) at atmosphere pressure. Liquid reactants were injected using a syringe pump, and gases were dosed using mass flow controllers (MFC) into the reactor. Firstly, the catalysts were pre-reduced under a H2 flow at 400 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The molar ratio of H2O to methanol was maintained at 1.0 and N2 was added as a balance gas with a flow rate at 30 mL min−1. The standard reaction tests were operated at 400 °C with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 4.5 h−1. The feed and product gases were quantitatively analyzed using an online gas chromatograph (GC-7890B, Agilent) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID). A TDX-01 column was connected to the TCD, whereas a TG-BOND Q capillary column was connected to the FID. The methanol conversion rates and product selectivity were calculated by the following equations:

  where Cin(MeOH) and Cout(MeOH) are the molar amounts of methanol in inlet and outlet flows, respectively.

  where Si refers to the product selectivity, xi is the molar percentage of products, and ni is the number of carbon atoms in product molecules.
Results and discussion
Preparation and characterization
Zn1CeyZr9Ox and Zn1Ce10Ox were both prepared by a wet-impregnation method with CeZr(OH)x and Ce(OH)3 as supports, respectively. A control sample, Ce1Zr9Ox, was obtained by calcination of Ce1Zr9(OH)x at 500 °C. The molar ratios of Zn/Ce/Zr determined by ICP-AES are nearly the same as the theoretical values (Table S1†). The specific surface area of Zn1CeyZr9Ox varies in the range of 50–62 m2 g−1, and the control samples Zn1Zr10Ox, Zn1Ce10Ox and Ce1Zr9Ox have BET surface areas of 34, 40 and 55 m2 g−1, respectively.
The XRD patterns of Zn1CeyZr9Ox and Ce1Zr9Ox only display the diffraction peaks of tetragonal (t) ZrO2 (Fig. 1A), suggesting that the foreign atom doping improves the stabilization of t-ZrO2.40 In the XRD patterns of Zn1CeyZr9Ox and CeyZr9Ox, the diffraction peak at 30.2° attributed to t-ZrO2 (101) gradually shifts to a lower angle in line with the Ce doping amount because of the larger ionic radius of Ce4+ (0.97 Å) compared to Zr4+ (0.84 Å).41 Compared with Ce1Zr9Ox, the t-ZrO2 (101) diffraction peak of Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox shifts to a higher angle because of the smaller ionic radius of Zn2+ (0.74 Å). No diffraction peaks attributed to ZnO could be observed for all Zn containing oxides. All these results confirm that the Zn1CeyZr9Ox samples are solid solutions due to the Zn2+ and Ce4+ doping into the lattice of t-ZrO2. The XRD pattern of Zn1Ce10Ox shows the diffraction peaks of cubic CeO2 (Fig. S1A†). In the XRD pattern of Zn1Zr10Ox (Fig. S1A†), only the diffraction peaks of t-ZrO2 were observed and the t-ZrO2 (101) diffraction peak shifts to a higher angle compared with t-ZrO2, showing the formation of ZnZrOx solid solutions. The UV-vis spectra of Zn1Zr10Ox resemble those of ZrO2 and there is no characteristic adsorption of ZnO particles (a strong adsorption below 400 nm),25 demonstrating the doping of Zn2+ into the lattice of t-ZrO2 (Fig. S1B†).

The HRTEM image in Fig. 1C shows that the interplanar spacing of Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox is ca. 0.30 nm, slightly larger than that of tetragonal ZrO2 (101), which is because of the doping of Ce4+ into the ZrO2 network. The HRTEM result is in accordance with the lattice expansion of Zn1CeyZr9Ox observed by XRD characterization, further confirming the formation of ZnCeZrOx solid solutions. The EDX mapping images show the uniform distribution of Zn, Ce and Zr, indicating the successful doping of Ce and Zn into the ZrO2 lattice (Fig. 1D). The phase at the surface regions of Zn1CeyZr9Ox was sensitively detected by UV Raman spectroscopy with the 266 nm excitation line (Fig. 1B and S2†). The appearance of a vibrational peak at 661 cm−1 assigned to Ce–O–Zr is observed in the UV Raman spectra of Zn1CeyZr9Ox and CeyZr9Ox, confirming the formation of a Ce–O–Zr structure in the surface skin layer.42,43 With the increase in Ce content, a gradual red-shift of this vibrational peak is observed as a consequence of the lattice expansion caused by cerium ion insertion into ZrO2. The above results further confirm that the Zn1CeyZr9Ox samples are ternary solid solutions. The HRTEM image of Zn1Zr10Ox shows that Zn and Zr are uniformly distributed and the interplanar spacing is ca. 0.295 nm, corresponding to the result that Zn1Zr10Ox is a solid solution catalyst (Fig. S1C and D†).
Activity and stability
SRM was performed in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor at 400 °C (Table 1). ZrO2 and Ce1Zr9Ox show low methanol conversion (≤12.5%) with DME as a dominant product while CeO2 gives a methanol conversion rate of 9.9% but mainly produces CO (47.1% sel.) and CH4 (41.0% sel.), suggesting that individual ZrO2, Ce1Zr9Ox and CeO2 cannot efficiently catalyze SRM. The methanol conversion (36.9%) and CO2 selectivity (87.0%) increased obviously for Zn1Ce10Ox, and Zn1Zr10Ox gave a 68.0% methanol conversion rate and a 97.5% CO2 selectivity, implying that Zn is indispensable for SRM.44 Encouragingly, Zn1CeyZr9Ox catalysts are very efficient for SRM, giving methanol conversion rates in the range of 93.6% to 99.8% with a CO2 selectivity of 93.9% to 95.3%, which shows that Zn1CeyZr9Ox catalysts are active and selective for SRM. Zn1Ce0.5Zr9Ox gives a methanol conversion rate of up to 99.8% with a CO2 selectivity of 93.9%. In addition to H2 and CO2, only small amounts of CO and DME were found for the Zn1CeyZr9Ox catalysts.

The influence of reaction conditions on the catalytic performance of ZnCeZrOx catalysts was investigated using Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox as a model catalyst (Fig. S3†). Typically, Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox affords an 8.2% methanol conversion with a CO selectivity as low as 0.3% at 300 °C. The methanol conversion increased with the increase in reaction temperature and a 99.9% methanol conversion along with a 5.6% CO selectivity was obtained at 420 °C. The amounts of CO also increased with the reaction temperature. The methanol conversion decreased from 96.0% to 64.0% accompanied by a decrease of CO selectivity from 4.5% to 2.4% by increasing the WHSV from 4.5 to 13.5 h−1, indicating the suppression of CO formation at high WHSV. Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox could still afford a 15.5% methanol conversion with a 2.3% CO selectivity even with a WHSV as high as 270 h−1, suggesting the high activity and selectivity of ZnCeZrOx catalysts in SRM. In summary, a well-defined ZnCeZrOx catalyst is developed, which shows high activity under a wide range of working conditions.
The H2 production rates of the Zn1CeyZr9Ox catalysts are estimated to be in the range of 103.8 to 109.5 μmolH2 gcat−1 s−1 with methanol conversions varying in the range of 93.6% to 99.8% at a WHSV of 4.5 h−1 (Table 1). In order to compare their intrinsic activities, we measured the H2 production rates of Zn1CeyZr9Ox and Zn1Zr10Ox at methanol conversions lower than 25% to eliminate the mass transfer limitations, and the H2 production rates were normalized by specific surface areas (Fig. 2 and S4†). The normalized H2 production rate follows the order Zn1Ce0.5Zr9Ox > Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox > Zn1Zr10Ox > Zn1Ce2Zr9Ox. Considering the influence of the Zn content on the catalytic performance, we compared the activities of Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox and Zn1Zr10Ox which have almost identical Zn contents to avoid the interference of the Zn content (Fig. 2). Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox also gives a higher methanol conversion (15.5%) than Zn1Zr10Ox (8.8%) but a lower CO selectivity (2.3% versus 2.7%). The normalized H2 production rates were compared to eliminate the mass transfer limitations and the influence of specific surface areas (Fig. 2). The normalized H2 production rate of Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox is about 1.2 times that of Zn1Zr10Ox, confirming the activity promotion effect of Ce. Zn1Ce0.5Zr9Ox is more active than Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox, but the latter shows a lower CO selectivity. Therefore, Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox was chosen as a model catalyst for the subsequent discussions.
 Fig. 2  Comparison of the catalytic performances of Zn1CeyZr9Ox (y = 0.5, 1, 2) and Zn1Zr10Ox for SRM. Reaction conditions: 400 °C, H2O/MeOH = 1.0, 0.080 mL min−1, and WHSV 270 h−1. Normalized H2 production rate = WHSV/Sbet × conv. × sel. CO2 × 3. 

Fig. 3A shows the stability of Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox at 400 °C with a WHSV of 9.0 h−1. In the initial 75 h, Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox is very stable and the methanol conversion is about 61.9%. Moreover, the robustness of Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox is evaluated by stopping the reaction at 75 h, cooling down to room temperature and then ramping up to 400 °C again in nitrogen. The methanol conversion increased slightly after this process and then decreased gradually to 55.9% in another 145 h. After that, the cooling-down and ramping up operation is performed once more and Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox remains stable for another 40 h. After 260 h long-time running, the methanol conversion can still be maintained at 56.6%, corresponding to only ∼5% loss in methanol conversion. The long-time running experiment suggests the high stability of Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox in SRM. However, the methanol conversion of Zn1Zr10Ox drops sharply from 43.8% to 22.4% after 100 h processing under similar reaction conditions (Fig. 3B), corresponding to about 21% loss in methanol conversion. Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox is even more stable than ZnO/ZnZrOx-9% which is stable for more than 200 h at 380 °C but fast loss of activity was observed at 400 °C (Fig. S5†).25 The above results show that Ce doping greatly enhances the stability of ZnCeZrOx in SRM.

The promotion effect of Ce
The EPR spectra of Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox show signals at 2.01 and 2.03 assigned to surface-adsorbed O2− species bound to Ce4+ ions and the g value of 2.003 is assigned to the Ov caused by Ce3+ ions (Fig. 4A).45,46 The appearance of strong signals of O2− points to the availability of a significant number of electrons, probably arising from Ce3+ ions in lattice positions, which may promote the oxygen mobility.47 It has been proved that the existence of Ce3+ can generate Ov on the catalyst surface.48 In addition, the signal intensity of Ov over Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox is much higher than that over Zn1Zr10Ox (Fig. 4A), showing that the formation of a ternary ZnCeZrOx solid solution results in a higher bulk Ov concentration.
 Fig. 4  (A) EPR spectra of Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox and Zn1Zr10Ox; (B) Ce 3d XPS of Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox. 
Based on XPS results (Table S1†), the surface Zn/Ce/Zr molar ratio of Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox is estimated to be 1.4/1.0/15.7, similar to that determined by ICP, showing that the elemental composition of the surface region is consistent with that of the bulk. Fig. 4B shows the co-existence of Ce3+ and Ce4+ for Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox. The Ce3+/(Ce4+ + Ce3+) ratio of Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox is about 33.6% (Table S2†). In the O 1s spectra (Fig. S6†), the binding energies of lattice oxygen (OL) and the O2− ions associated with surface Ov appeared at ∼529.0 eV and ∼530.4 eV, respectively.41,49 The surface Ov concentration of Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox (53.2%) is much higher than that of Zn1Zr10Ox (39.6%) which agrees well with the results obtained from the Ce 3d spectra, revealing that Ce doping facilitates the generation of Ov. The binding energies of O, Zn and Zr shift to lower values after Ce doping, implying the strong interaction between ZnO, CeO2 and ZrO2, which favors the substitution of Zn and Ce within the lattice of ZrO2.24 Compared to pure CeO2, the binding energy of Ce in the Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox catalyst did not show an obvious change. The decrease of the binding energies of O, Zn and Zr in the same direction is possibly assigned to a kind of reduction, which is often observed in samples containing Ce in ultra-high vacuum environments.50,51 From the combined results of EPR and XPS, Ce doping results in a higher Ov concentration possibly due to the unique redox properties of CeO2, which are helpful to generate and stabilize the surrounding defects.52

In situ Raman spectroscopy coupled with mass spectroscopy was conducted to deduce the reaction mechanism on Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox. After being reduced in H2, a strong vibration peak at around 596 cm−1 assigned to Ov appears in the Raman spectra of Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox (Fig. 5A), showing that H2 reduction can generate Ov. The peak of Ov disappears after dosing with H2O at 400 °C and a small H2 signal is observed (Fig. 5C), implying the participation of Ov in H2O activation. After dosing with a mixture of methanol and water, the peak of Ov disappears and a small amount of HCHO and HCOOH is detected in the effluent gas along with H2 and CO2 (Fig. 5B), indicating that HCOOH is an important intermediate in SRM. In order to investigate the reaction pathway, TPSR tests were conducted over Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox (Fig. S7†). A small amount of HCHO is detected in the effluent gas along with H2, indicating that methanol could be easily dehydrogenated to HCHO at low temperatures. The amounts of HCHO decrease obviously at about 300 °C and the signals of CO2 and HCOOH increase simultaneously. HCOOH is formed by nucleophilic attack of H2O to HCHO, which in turn decomposes to H2 and CO2. No HCOOCH3 signal was detected. Thus, SRM over Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox occurs through the HCOOH reaction pathway, similar to that of ZnZr mixed oxides reported previously.25 The apparent activation energy (Ea) of Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox (137 kJ mol−1) is similar to that of ZnZr mixed oxides (Fig. S8†), demonstrating that Ce doping does not change the reaction pathway of SRM.

Since water activation is a key step in SRM, the active sites of the metal oxide catalysts for water activation are investigated.
The H2O activation ability of Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox was measured and compared with those of Zn1Zr10Ox and Ce1Zr9Ox by the in situ Raman/MS technique. In the Raman spectra of Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox, the vibration peak of Ov disappears after H2O dosage at 400 °C and H2 is detected at the same time by MS, illustrating that water prefers to dissociate on Ov by transferring H atoms to the neighboring surface oxygen for H2 production (Fig. 5A and C).52,53 A similar phenomenon was also observed for Zn1Zr10Ox (Fig. S9A and B†), but the H2 production rate is obviously lower than that of Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox (from the slope of the MS signal), demonstrating that Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox has a higher amount of Ov for water activation than the latter, consistent with the EPR and XPS results. It should be mentioned that H2O can also be activated with the Ce1Zr9Ox solid solution to produce H2 (Fig. S10A and B†) and the amount of H2 produced is only slightly lower than that of Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox, showing the water is adsorbed and disassociated mainly on the Ov stabilized by Ce3+. The much higher activity of Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox than that of Ce1Zr9Ox in SRM indicates the significant role of ZnO in methanol activation, implying the synergy of Zn and Ov for SRM.
The temperature-programmed surface reaction coupled with mass spectroscopy (TPSR/MS) further confirms the promotion effect of Ce (Fig. 5D). A small amount of H2 is detected in the effluent gas at about 140 °C, indicating that H2O could be easily dissociated to H2 at low temperatures over Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox. However, a higher temperature (>200 °C) is needed for H2 production for Zn1Zr10Ox, showing that Ce doping promotes the ability for H2O activation. On the basis of these findings, we believe that water is adsorbed and disassociated on Ov and methanol activation occurs on ZnO. Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox shows very high stability in SRM and only about 5% loss in methanol conversion is observed after running for 260 h under harsh conditions. To explore the stability promotion of Ce, the spent Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox was characterized in detail. The UV Raman spectrum of spent Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox is identical to that of the fresh one and Ce–O–Zr vibration could still be observed (Fig. 6B). Notably, the vibration peak assigned to Ov was clearly observed in the Raman spectrum of spent Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox after H2 reduction (Fig. S11†), implying that Ce-doping greatly promotes the Ov regeneration ability owing to its unique redox properties.

The XRD pattern of spent Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox is almost the same as that of the fresh one (Fig. 6A), implying that the phase structure of ZnCeZrOx is very stable during the SRM process. In addition, the EDX mapping images of the spent Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox are similar to that of the fresh one (Fig. 6C), showing no aggregation of ZnO during SRM. Thus, Ce doping could stabilize surface Ce–O–Zr and the phase structure of ZnCeZrOx during the SRM process.
The TG curve of the spent Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox is almost the same as that of the fresh one and the small amounts of weight loss from 100 to 800 °C are possibly due to the adsorbed water and lattice oxygen (Fig. 6D). The TG curve of the spent Zn1Zr10Ox shows a weight loss of about 1 wt% at temperatures from 300 °C to 500 °C assigned to the loss of carbon deposited on the surface of the catalyst (Fig. S12†). In the UV-Raman spectrum of the spent Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox (Fig. 6B), a very weak band at 1606 cm−1 assigned to deposited carbon was observed. The combined TG and UV Raman characterization results show only trace amounts of carbon deposition after long term SRM, indicating that Ce incorporation into the ZnZrOx solid solution can effectively inhibit carbon deposition. Moreover, the enhanced Ov regeneration capacity and H2O activation ability caused by the redox properties (Ce4+/Ce3+) are favorable for carbon elimination reactions.54 The characterization results for the spent catalyst show that Ce incorporation not only stabilizes the structure of Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox but also suppresses carbon deposition.
In SRM, water prefers to dissociate on Ov by transferring H atoms to the neighboring surface oxygen, followed by *OH nucleophilic attack activated CH2O* to form HCOOH, which in turn decomposes to H2 and CO2. After the OH has left, the Ov are regenerated for the next H2O dissociation.25,52 The activated CH2O* should be reacted with OH* (dissociated by water) to form HCOOH. The matched formation rates of CH2O* and OH* favor the reaction to take place through the SRM route. If the formation rate of OH* is lower than that of CH2O*, the direct decomposition of methanol will occur, which leads to a higher CO concentration and carbon deposition on the catalyst surface. Therefore, matched rates for H2O dissociation and methanol activation are essential in SRM. In previous reports, a high defect structure of the support such as in solid solutions and metal oxides rich in Ov would greatly increase the ability for water dissociation.31,33 In particular, engineering the water activation efficiency is quite important for mixed metal oxide catalysts.
Conclusions
ZnCeZrOx mixed oxide catalysts were prepared and applied for H2 production via SRM. Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox doped with cerium is more active and stable than the counterpart without cerium doping. The structural characterization studies show that Zn1Ce1Zr9Ox is a ternary solid solution with Zn and Ce doped into the lattice of ZrO2 to form Ce–O–Zr or Zn–O–Zr. The EPR and XPS characterization studies indicate that the unique redox properties of CeO2 between Ce4+ and Ce3+ are helpful to generate and stabilize Ov, leading to a higher water dissociation activity. In situ Raman spectroscopy and TPSR results show that Ov can be easily regenerated under a H2 atmosphere which is favourable for water activation during the SRM process. The synergy of Ov sites and ZnO respectively for water and methanol activation contributes to the high activity of ZnCeZrOx. Detailed characterization studies of the spent catalyst revealed that the incorporation of Ce not only stabilized the solid solution structure of ZnCeZrOx but also suppressed carbon deposition due to its higher water activation activity. This work demonstrates that water dissociation activity is crucial for promoting the activity and stability of mixed metal oxide catalysts in SRM.
