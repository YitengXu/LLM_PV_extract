    , Accepted 18th May 2021First published on 7th June 2021AbstractThree novel push–pull dyes, with carbazole donors, coded AJ502, TZ101 and TZ102 are synthesized and applied as co-sensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). TZ101 and TZ102 have similar structures except for two fluorine atoms introduced on the benzotriazole (BTZ) unit. AJ502 shows a near-IR absorption spectrum that is suitable for co-sensitization with TZ101 and TZ102. The co-sensitized DSSC device based on CO-1 (AJ502:TZ101 = 3:4 (0.075 mM:0.1 mM)) achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.3% under AM 1.5G irradiation, with 1.06 V open-circuit voltage (Voc), 13.75 mA cm−2 short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), and 70.8% fill factor (FF), a significant improvement compared to the single dye, 6.0% for AJ502 and 5.1% for TZ101 with a copper(I/II)-based redox electrolyte. A PCE of 8.9% is also obtained by devices based on CO-2 (AJ502:TZ102 = 3:4). For CO-1, the fluorine atoms in TZ101 play a critical role by widening the active light capturing bands of both TZ101 and AJ502 on the TiO2 film while TZ102 and AJ502 show weaker interaction under the same conditions. The UV-vis spectrum and Raman spectrum revealed that AJ502 can form supramolecules with TZ101 and TZ102 formed on the TiO2 film.
1. Introduction
Energy demand and the shortage of fossil fuels have stimulated the growth of renewable solar energy in recent years. Photovoltaic technologies provide an available way for sunlight harvesting. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), one of the third-generation solar cells, have been developed rapidly since the first report by Grätzel et al. owing to their low-cost, high photovoltaic performances and design opportunities in terms of color and semi-transparency.1 In the past decades, many attempts have been made to further enhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability mainly focusing on the photosensitizer, electrolyte and counter electrode (CE) for future employment in transparent type building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) devices and “smart window” technologies.2–9 An outstanding PCE of 13% for the organometallic sensitizer was achieved with a zinc-porphyrin coded SM315 by Grätzel et al.10 Meanwhile, DSSCs based on metal-free donor–π bridge–acceptor (D–π–A) organic sensitizers have gained increasing popularity on account of flexible structures and wide absorption.11–16 Yang et al. reported that a triazatruxene (TAT)-based sensitizer ZL003, as a champion single sensitizer, yielded the highest PCE of 13.6%.17 In this respect, photosensitizers, as the engine of the cells, need to capture more available sunlight to achieve a higher PCE. More efforts on developing new molecules should be made jointly with the optimization of the structure–electrochemical property relationship with Cu(I/II) complexes as redox couples. A lower driving force for dye regeneration is possible with Cu-complexes in comparison with the conventional I−/I3− electrolyte and Co(II/III) electrolyte, leading to higher open-circuit voltages (Voc).18–21
However, one problem for organic sensitizers is their narrow absorption band compared to the solar spectrum. This can be solved by co-sensitization using two or more dyes to achieve a panchromatic response.22–26 DSSCs based on co-sensitization are a highly active area of research since considerable development has been made recently. Our previous work showed an almost entire visible region response, achieving an efficiency of 8.2%.27 Xie et al. synthesized a series of porphyrin dyes and a 12.1% PCE was observed based on the traditional iodine electrolyte.28 DSSCs based on the famous metal-free dye of Y123 and the porphyrin dye YD2-o-C8 presented an excellent PCE of 12.3%, a higher PCE performance than those of the individual dyes with the Co(II/III) redox electrolyte.29 Freitag et al. introduced two previous dyes coded D35 and XY1 in conjunction with Cu(I/II) redox shuttle and achieved a PCE of 11.3% under 100 W cm−2 AM 1.5G illumination.30
Here, three novel carbazole dyes, with 5,14-dihexyl-8,8,17,17-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-5,8,14,17-tetrahydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dicarbazole as an electron donor group and 2-ethylhexylbromide-2,5-dihydro-3,6-di-2-thienyl-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (EH2DPP(Th)2) as the π bridge coded AJ502, while 5,11-dihydroindolo[3,2-b] carbazole (ICZ) as an electron-donating group and 5,6-difluoro-octyl-4,7-bis(4-hexylthio-phen-2-yl)-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole as an electron-withdrawing unit coded TZ101 and TZ102, were designed and synthesized. Benzotriazole (BTZ) was introduced to investigate the electron withdrawal function. Furthermore, two fluorine atoms were added to BTZ to examine the effect on the push–pull system. A 10.3% PCE under standard AM 1.5G solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2) for a co-sensitized DSSC device with AJ502 and TZ101 (CO-1) was observed, which was greater than those of the individual dyes (6.0% for AJ502 and 5.1% for TZ101), combined with copper redox shuttle Cu(I/II) (tmby)2 TFSI2/1 (tmby, 4,4,6,6-tetramethyl-2,2-bipyridine; TFSI, bistrifluoromethane sulfonimidate). This is mainly due to a substantial (more than 50%) increase in photocurrent. Usually, the photocurrent of co-sensitized DSSCs is much lower than the sum of the photocurrents from the single dye devices because of spectral overlap in absorption. The PCE of the co-sensitized DSSCs almost equaled the sum of the PCEs of the individual single dyes, AJ502 and TZ101. A supramolecular interaction between these dyes on the TiO2 surface shifted and extended the active light-capture range. Another co-sensitized DSSC device without fluorine atoms (CO-2, sensitized by AJ502 and TZ102) showed a lower PCE of 8.9% under the same conditions (Fig. 1).

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Optical properties
Steady-state ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of AJ502, TZ101, TZ102, CO-1, and CO-2 dissolved in dichloromethane (1 × 10−5 M) were measured and are presented in Fig. 2a. Fluorescence spectra of the dyes in solution are shown in Fig. S1.†AJ502, TZ101 and TZ102 exhibited the maximum absorption at λmax = 625 nm (ε = 43223 mol L−1 cm−1), λmax = 422 nm (ε = 50772 mol L−1 cm−1) and λmax = 413 (ε = 38550 mol L−1 cm−1) in dichloromethane, respectively. The corresponding optical data can be found in Table 1. The data showed the absorption capability of TZ101 and TZ102 between 350 and 500 nm, with almost no absorption between 500 and 700 nm. A slight 3 nm red shift and a much stronger absorption resulted from the introduction of fluorine. AJ502 had a narrow spectral response in the range of 350–450 nm, as well as a wide absorption between 500 and 700 nm, enabling the harvest of near-IR sunlight. When TZ101 and TZ102 were mixed with AJ502 to form CO-1 and CO-2, respectively, many interesting changes of the absorption spectra occurred in the TiO2 film (the photographs in Fig. S2†).

In solution (Fig. 2a), the absorption spectrum of CO-1 was almost equal to the sum of individual TZ101 and AJ502 spectra, and the absorption spectrum of CO-2 was almost equal to the sum of individual TZ102 and AJ502 spectra. In Fig. 2b, the AJ502, CO-1 and CO-2 absorption spectra on the TiO2 film were normalized with respect to the 584 nm maximum of AJ502. CO-1 exhibited a much stronger and broader absorption than CO-2, which corresponded to solution spectra. In solution, the AJ502 spectrum had two maxima at 582 nm and 623 nm, and the 623 nm peak was higher. On the TiO2 film, the corresponding peaks did not shift, but the peak of 623 nm is much lower than that of 583 nm, which may be caused by deprotonation of the carboxyl group on TiO2. However, the CO-1 absorption around 623 nm was greatly enhanced and the overall absorption region was broadened. At the same time, CO-1 exhibited a much stronger absorption than CO-2 in the range of 350–450 nm. The F atom played a critical role in broadening the light-capturing region. Based on these results, supramolecular co-adsorption on the TiO2 film was detected and the result of IPCE spectra presented below (Fig. 7b) will also confirm this hypothesis, which is illustrated in Fig. 6 by DFT calculations.
2.2 Supramolecular interactions at the TiO2 film
To further inspect the supramolecular interaction between AJ502 and TZ101, and AJ502 and TZ102, Raman spectroscopy was applied. AJ502 was co-absorbed with TZ101 and TZ102 with a 1:1 mol ratio on the TiO2 film (CO-1 and CO-2 respectively), and their Raman spectra are shown in Fig. 3; compared with single dye-absorbed TiO2, the peaks of AJ502 didn't change both in CO-1 and CO-2. The wavenumber peaks of 1578 and 1575 cm−1, which were attributed to the –CN– bond of TZ dye, decreased the intensity of the Raman spectral response obviously in CO-1 and in CO-2. The reduced intensity of the Raman spectrum of CO-1 and CO-2 wavenumber peaks may be due to non-interacting dyes. Because different dyes have different self-adsorption rates to reach TiO2 nanoparticles, which showed a change in absorption intensity. We also observed that the bands of –C–C– at 1401 and 1418 cm−1, which show a similar pattern of change to the –CN– bond. The wavenumber peak around 1447 cm−1, which was attributed to the –C–N– bond of the electron-withdrawing group in TZ dyes, might disappear or shift when the co-absorbed TiO2 films of CO-1 and CO-2 had the same sensitization time.

This wavenumber peak of the Raman spectrum with an obvious change strongly proves the interaction of AJ502 and TZ dyes on the TiO2 film. In order to further verify the analytical affiliation of the wavenumber peaks of AJ502, TZ101 and TZ102, the computational spectrum was obtained from the Raman spectrum of theoretical calculations, which showed the theoretical results to be the measured results in Fig. 3c. The theoretical and measured Raman spectra of single dyes showed a similar wavenumber peak and profile, which proved the correctness of wavenumber attribution. To sum up the above analysis results proved that AJ502 and TZ101 formed supramolecular interaction on the TiO2 film through electron-withdrawing groups, so did AJ502 and TZ102.
In order to further evaluate the interaction between AJ502 and TZ series dyes, the structural optimization of AJ502 + TZ101 (CO-1) and AJ502 + TZ102 (CO-2) was performed by DFT calculations using the Gaussian 09 package at the B3LYP/6-311 level (for simplifying the computation, the long alkyl chains of these dyes were replaced with the methyl group). We can intuitively observe that the conjugation moiety of AJ502 keeps almost plane and TZ series dyes twisted as approaching with minimized energy. The benzotriazole group in TZ101 is much more slanting to the π bridge of AJ502 than that of TZ102, with the dihedral angles between AJ502 and TZ101, and AJ502 and TZ102 of 11.6° and 20.7° in Fig. 4, respectively. At the same time, the two fluorine atoms in TZ101 are much more close to the π bridge of AJ502 than the corresponding hydrogen atoms of TZ102. These results show that, at these distances, intermolecular interactions can be formed and the fluorine atoms enhanced these intermolecular interactions in the AJ502 + TZ101 system. This is in accordance with UV-vis spectra (Fig. 2) and the IPCE spectrum (Fig. 7b).

2.3 Electrochemical properties
Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) measurements were performed to determine the oxidation potentials of AJ502, TZ101 and TZ102 adsorbed on TiO2 (Fig. S3†). For AJ502, TZ101, and TZ102, the oxidation potentials were 1.07 V, 1.03 V and 0.97 V vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively, which are more positive than the redox potential of 0.87 V for Cu(I/II) versus the SHE, ensuring an adequate driving force for dye regeneration.
Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (Fig. S7†) indicated that the HOMO levels of AJ502, TZ101 and CO-1 adsorbed on the TiO2 film were −5.40 eV, −5.50 eV and −5.46 eV, respectively, as calculated by eqn (1) φ = 21.21 eV − (Ecutoff − Efermi)(1)
The zero–zero transition energies (E0–0) of AJ502, TZ101, and TZ102 were estimated by the tangent of the absorption on TiO2 and the x-axis values of 1.76 V, 2.36 V, and 2.36 V vs. the NHE, respectively. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of AJ502, TZ101, and TZ102 were calculated from eqn (2): ELUMO = EHOMO − E0–0(2)which were −0.69 V, −1.33 V, and −1.39 V vs. the NHE in Fig. 5, respectively. AJ502 (−0.69 V) shows a lower lying excited state energy level compared to TZ101 and TZ102, but there is still an adequate impetus for electron injection of electrons from the excited dyes to the TiO2 conduction-band (CB). Detailed data can be found in Table 1.

2.4 Theoretical model calculations
The electronic structures of AJ502, TZ101, and TZ102 were determined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations using the Gaussian 09 package at the B3LYP/6-311(d,p) level. In Fig. 6, intramolecular charge transfer transitions are indicated by the outlines of frontier molecular orbitals. For AJ502, the electron density of the HOMO−1 is mainly located on the electron donor group, while for the HOMO it is mainly distributed on the thienyl units and EH2DPP(Th)2 because of the weak electron donor capability. The electron densities for the LUMO and LUMO+1 are located on the EH2DPP(Th)2 and benzoic acid segments, respectively. For TZ101 and TZ102, the HOMO is located on the indolo[3,2-b]carbazole group and the thienyl units, and the LUMO is located on the thienyl units, BTZ, and benzoic acid segments. Thus, intramolecular charge transfer can be suggested from the difference in the LUMOs and HOMOs. The corresponding data can be found in Table 2.

2.5 Photovoltaic performance
The DSSCs were operated based on the separate dyes (AJ502, TZ101 and TZ102) as well as different co-sensitization mixtures. Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured under AM 1.5G simulated solar light at a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. In Table 3, devices based on the best co-sensitization ratio coded CO-1 (AJ502:TZ101 = 3:4 (0.075 mM:0.1 mM)) exhibit a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.3%, with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.06 V, a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 13.75 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of (FF) 70.8%, and this PCE is far above the PCEs of the individual dyes, 5.1% PCE for TZ101 and 6.0% PCE for AJ502, respectively. Data for devices based on other concentration ratios can be found in Fig. S4.† In contrast, DSSCs based on CO-2 (AJ502:TZ102 = 3:4 (0.075 mM:0.1 mM)) yield a lower PCE of 8.9% with Voc = 1.00 V, Jsc = 12.01 mA cm−2, and FF = 74.5%. The reproducibility of CO-1 DSSCs is examined and displayed in Fig. S5a.† We are pleased that the DSSCs based on CO-1 present a high Voc (1.06 V), which indicated less recombination between electrons in the TiO2 and the electrolyte (CuI/II(tmby)2TFSI1/2). Through comparison, CO-1 exhibits higher and better Voc and PCE values than the previous reports for devices based on the DPP group with traditional electrolytes in Fig. 7c and Table S3.† The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 3. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements for DSSCs sensitized by single dyes and co-sensitization are presented in Fig. 7b. The CO-1 device exhibited a red shift and broader active regions over 420–530 nm and 580–700 nm relative to devices sensitized by single TZ101, AJ502, and by CO-2, which implied that the introduction of the two fluorine atoms broadened the absorption spectrum of the co-sensitized device. Furthermore, devices based on the CO-1 had higher IPCE values relative to those of the CO-2 device over nearly the entire region measured. Photocurrents of 12.8 mA cm−2 and 11.4 mA cm−2 were calculated from IPCE spectra for CO-1 and CO-2, respectively, which agree well with the J–V measurements.

Usually CDCA (chenodeoxycholic acid) was applied as a co-adsorbent in DSSCs to prevent the aggregation of dyes on TiO2 to enhance the PCEs of the devices. When AJ502, TZ101 and TZ102 co-absorbed with CDCA individually, both of these DSSC devices gave much lower Jsc and lower PCEs than that of without CDCA (Fig. S6 and Table S2†). This phenomenon means that the high PCEs of CO-1 and CO-2 don't due to reduce intermolecular aggregation, which attributes to supramolecular intermolecular interaction by single dyes.
2.6 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed to examine charge-transfer and transport processes that occur over the frequency range 0.1–100 kHz at a 10 kHz interval in the dark at the open-circuit voltage.31,32 A Nyquist plot of the device is presented in Fig. 8a (1.10 V for CO-1 and CO-2). The co-sensitization DSSCs were scanned with 0.90 to 1.10 V bias voltages at 50 mV intervals and the plots for charge transfer resistance, capacitance and electron lifetime can be found in Fig. 8b–d. Device data for DSSCs sensitized by single dyes are listed in Fig. S8.† In Fig. 8a, the first semicircle depicts the transport resistance (Rtra) that occurs at the Pt/electrolyte interface in the high frequency range.
 Fig. 8  EIS analysis data: (a) Nyquist plots under a forward bias of 1.05 V, (b) recombination resistance Rrec (c) chemical capacitance Cμ, and (d) electron lifetime τ plots. 
The second semicircle depicts charge-transfer at the TiO2/dyes/electrolyte interface in the middle frequency range. The corresponding charge recombination resistance (Rrec) is in the order of CO-1 > CO-2 (Fig. 8b). A higher Rrec has lower recombination between the Cu(I/II) and TiO2, leading to a higher Voc. The electron lifetime (τ) can be imparted by eqn (3) τ = Rrec × Cμ (chemical capacitance)(3)being in the order CO-1 > CO-2 (Fig. 8d). A longer electron lifetime indicates less electron recombination, which increases Voc. The main difference in electron lifetime could be attributed to Rrec since there is only a slight difference in the Cμ (Fig. 8c and Table 4). The charge collection efficiencies (ηcc) are given by eqn (4)33 ηcc = 1 − [Rtra × (Rtra + Rrec)−1](4)

The CO-1 value (96.9%) is higher than that for CO-2 (95.0%), the detailed data of which are listed in Table 4. These data, and in particular the electron lifetime measurements, explain the different Voc values obtained for the different dye-sensitized systems, which agree well with the J–V measurements.
2.7 Stability of CO-1
The CO-1 DSSC stability was examined in a dark ambient environment with 40% relative humidity at ∼22 °C and the data are shown in Fig. 9. The devices sensitized with CO-1 maintain almost 88% of the initial PCE under AM 1.5G simulated solar light (100 mW cm−2) after 670 h. There was a 11.8% reduction in Jsc, the main cause for the PCE decrease, as well as a slight 10 mV decrease for Voc, and a slight increase in the FF.

In summary, three novel dyes (AJ502, TZ101 and TZ102) were designed and synthesized by simple reactions and applied as co-sensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). A 10.3% PCE was observed for CO-1 (AJ502:TZ101 = 3:4 (0.075 mM:0.1 mM)) in conjunction with a copper(I/II)-based redox electrolyte under one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G). The co-sensitization dyes of CO-1 and CO-2 are adsorbed on the TiO2 film in a supramolecular fashion, widening the active light capturing band. CO-1 also exhibits less recombination with Cu(I/II) at the TiO2 interface compared to CO-2. Co-sensitization with the supramolecular effect expanded the absorption spectrum and interestingly increased the IPCE values improving substantially the photocurrent with the copper complex-based redox. This work thus provides an appropriate way to design co-sensitizers and apply them in DSSCs.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Device fabrication
All device fabrication steps in this work were performed and modified following the reported literature.5 The TiCl4 compact layers, TiO2 layers, and Pt counter electrode were used as described in our previously reported work. In brief, fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass was washed sequentially with detergent water solution, ethanol, acetone, and then deionized water in an ultrasonic bath and then two compact layers were attached by heat treatment at 70 °C for 40 min with 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution and washed with deionized water. Next, the substrate was heated at 500 °C. After cooling to room temperature, the mesoporous TiO2 electrodes (6 μm transparent layer + 4 μm scatting layer) obtained by screen printing were heated to 500 °C for 1 h. Another compact layer was obtained by heat treatment at 70 °C for 40 min with 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution and washed with deionized water followed by heating at 500 °C. Furthermore, the electrodes were immersed in the solution of 2 × 10−4 M dye in DCM at room temperature for 18 h. The devices were packaged by assembling the dye-loaded film as the working electrode and the Pt counter electrode separated with a hot-melt Surlyn film (25 μm). Finally, copper electrolytes were injected into the inner space between the TiO2 electrode and the counter electrode through a hole, and then sealed with a Surlyn film.
