    , Accepted 24th August 2014First published on 26th August 2014AbstractFormamidinium lead trihalide perovskite (FAPbI3) was successfully introduced into hole-conductor-free, fully printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells with a carbon counter electrode. With the sequential deposition method, a FAPbI3 based solar cell yielded an efficiency of 11.9%, superior to the methylammonium lead trihalide perovskite (MAPbI3) solar cell efficiency of 11.4%, which is due to broadening of the light to 840 nm. By optimizing the mixing ratio of the formamidimium and methylammonium cations to 3:2, a power conversion efficiency of 12.9% was achieved with this low-cost, fully printable mesoscopic solar cell, which indicated a promising prospect for low-cost photovoltaic technology.
Introduction
Over the last two years, hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells have distinguished themselves as an impressively efficient, inexpensive photovoltaic technology.1–6 By cooperating with Spiro-OMeTAD as the hole-transporting material (HTM) and methylammonium lead trihalide perovskite (MAPbI3) as the light-harvester, a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.9% has been achieved in early 2014, making MAPbI3 a potential candidate for solid-state photovoltaic devices.7
To fulfil the requirements of commercial applications, two of the most important issues in perovskite solar cells should be addressed.8–10 First of all, the use of HTMs bears a large proportion of cost and device stability for such solar cells, limiting their approach to low-cost photovoltaic devices. Fortunately, the ambipolar property of perovskite makes it act as both an electron and hole-transporting material in the solar cells. Thus, HTM-free structured mesoscopic solar cells emerged and were developed recently, and PCEs over 10% were reported both by our and other groups.11–15 Secondly, most of the perovskite solar cells employed noble metals, such as Au or Ag, as counter electrodes (CEs), prepared by thermal evaporation under high vacuum conditions, which is highly energy-consuming and complicated. Therefore, it is necessary to replace the evaporated metal (Au/Ag) electrode with low cost materials to reduce the cost of solar cell fabrication and realize large-scale fabrication. As alternative electrodes, carbon-based electrodes have been widely investigated due to their low cost, easy preparation and screen printable deposition for large scale production.16–18 Previously, we have developed mesoscopic MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells with a low-cost carbon CE and a fully printable process.14,15 By tuning the morphology of mesoporous carbon CEs and the TiO2 scaffold, highly efficient mesoscopic perovskite solar cells were obtained. The PCE of 10.64% encouraged us to further optimize this type of perovskite solar cell.
To date, the most-studied perovskite light-harvesters are MAPbI3 and MAPbI3−xClx, which have a bandgap of approximately 1.55 eV, giving light absorption across most of the solar spectrum to 800 nm.6 Nevertheless, it is known that the optimal bandgap for a single junction solar cell is between 1.1 and 1.4 eV,19 which is currently beyond the range of the MAPbI3 system. One effective method is to mix PbI2 with SnI2 to form CH3NH3SnxPb(1−x)I3, which obtained a band gap as low as 1.1 eV. The edge of the incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) curve extended to 1060 nm.20–22 However, Sn2+ would be easily oxidized to Sn4+ in the atmosphere, which damages the optical and photovoltaic properties of this material, and hinders its practical application. Another strategy is to substitute the organic cations, and it was demonstrated that the enlargement of the octahedral network influenced the bandgap of the perovskite effectively. In a recent report, the formamidinium cation (HC(NH2)2+, FA), which is slightly larger than methylammonium (CH3NH3+, MA), was proven to form 3D perovskite sufficiently with a lower bandgap of about 1.47 eV. An average PCE of 9.7% and the highest PCE of 14.2% were reported based on a planar FAPbI3 perovskite structure without a porous TiO2 layer. By combining MAI with FAI in a sequential deposition method, the efficiencies of 14.9% and 16.01% were obtained.23–27
To increase the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and thus enhance the efficiency of hole-conductor-free mesoscopic perovskite solar cells with a carbon CE, we attempted to introduce formamidinium lead trihalide perovskite (FAPbI3) into the solar cell to broaden the light-harvesting area. It was demonstrated that the IPCE of the solar cell with a pure FAPbI3 light harvester was extended to 840 nm and the Jsc was improved from 17.5 mA cm−2 to 18.4 mA cm−2 compared with that of the MAPbI3 based solar cell by the sequential deposition method. A PCE of 11.9% was achieved for the FAPbI3 perovskite solar cell, which is superior to that of MAPbI3 with a PCE of 11.4%. By optimizing the mixing ratio of the FAI and MAI cations to 3:2, an optimal PCE of 12.9% was reached due to the enhanced short-circuit current density and little loss of FF and open-circuit voltage (Voc). These results indicated a promising prospect for low-cost photovoltaic technology.
Experimental section
Synthesis of MAI and FAI
MAI and FAI were prepared according to the literature.25,28 MAI was synthesized by adding 27 mL methylamine into 30 mL HI (57 wt% in water) at 0 °C for 2 hours with stirring. After removing the solvent, the product was washed with diethyl ether and then recrystallized with ethanol. The white crystals were obtained and dried in a vacuum box. FAI was synthesized by adding 3 g of formamidine acetate into 13 mL HI (57 wt% in water), and stirring for half an hour at 50 °C. The solvent was removed by rotary evaporation, and the yellow precipitate was washed several times with diethyl ether, followed by recrystallization with ethanol. White crystals were obtained and dried in a vacuum box.
Fabrication of mesoscopic perovskite solar cells based on carbon CE
FTO glass was etched with a laser to form two detached electrode patterns before being ultrasonically cleaned with detergent, deionized water and ethanol successively. Subsequently, the patterned substrates were coated with a roughly 100 nm compact TiO2 layer by aerosol spray pyrolysis at 450 °C. After cooling down to room temperature naturally, a TiO2 nanocrystalline layer (PASOL HPW-18NR) was deposited on top of the compact layer by screen printing and then sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. After that, a ZrO2 spacer layer and a 10 μm mesoscopic carbon layer were printed on the top of the TiO2 nanocrystalline layer successively, and the films were then sintered at 400 °C for 30 min. The ZrO2 and carbon slurries were prepared as we reported previously.14,15 The deposition of perovskite into the three TiO2/ZrO2/carbon mesoscopic porous films was achieved by a two-step sequential deposition method, and the illustration of the device fabrication process with the sequential deposition method is shown in Fig. 1c. Firstly, the porous films were infiltrated with PbI2 by drop-coating 1.5 μL PbI2 solution (1.1 M, 0.507 g PbI2 was dissolved in 1 mL DMF by heating at 70 °C overnight) on the top of the carbon layer. After drying at 70 °C for 30 minutes, the films coated with PbI2 were dipped in a solution of MAI or FAI (both the concentrations are 0.063 M) in isopropanol for 15 minutes. The colour of the films would change from yellow to dark brown when perovskite formed. After that, the films were rinsed with isopropanol to remove unreacted MAI or FAI, followed by a heating treatment at 70 °C for another 30 minutes. All the reagents were purchased from Aldrich and used without further purification. All the procedures above were completed in air conditions.

Characterization
The thickness of the films was measured with a profilometer (VeecoDektak 150). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were obtained using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The absorption measurement was performed by a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Lambda 950, PerkinElmer). The cross section of the devices and the carbon films were imaged by a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter and a Newport solar simulator (model 91192-1000) giving light with AM 1.5G spectral distribution. A black mask with a circular aperture (0.07 cm2) smaller than the active area of the square solar cell (0.5 cm2) was applied on top of the cell. The scan rate was 250 mV s−1 and the scan direction was from open-circuit to short circuit. The incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a 150 W xenon lamp (Oriel) fitted with a monochromator (Cornerstone 74004) as a monochromatic light source. The impedance measurements were performed using a potentiostat (EG&G, M2273) in the dark. The frequency range was from 1 MHz to 100 mHz.
Results and discussion
The schematic of a typical hole-conductor-free mesoscopic solar cell based on a carbon CE is presented in Fig. 1a.14,29 All of the films in the mesoscopic solar cell were fabricated by screen-printing technology, including the mesoscopic carbon CE. A point worth emphasizing is that the TiO2 film and the mesoscopic carbon CE were separated by the mesoporous ZrO2 layer, ensuring that there was no threat of direct contact between the photoanode and the CE. Moreover, the series resistance of the device was controlled by the thickness of the porous ZrO2 layer with the technology of screen-printing.15
The energy level diagram is presented in Fig. 1b, and the positions of the energy levels are according to the literature.6 The valence band of the perovskites MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 are −5.43 eV and −5.67 eV vs. vacuum energy, respectively, which are lower than the work function of our carbon counter electrode (about −5.0 eV).14 Thus, it is energetically favourable for the holes to be transported through the perovskite layer and collected by the carbon CE. The conduction band of TiO2 is about −4.20 eV, allowing both pure MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 to inject electrons into TiO2. The conduction band of ZrO2 is −3.4 eV, higher than that of TiO2 and the MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 perovskites, which prevents the photoexcited electrons from reaching the back contact.
The XRD spectra of MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 with the one-step method on the glass substrate are shown in Fig. 2a. The sharp diffraction peaks indicate the high crystallinity of the as-synthesized MAPbI3 and FAPbI3, and the diffraction peaks are fairly consistent with the reported literature. All the characteristic diffraction peaks of MAPbI3 are observed at angles of 28.1°, 28.4°, 31.9°, 40.4° and 43.0°, which are indexed to the (004), (220), (310), (224), and (314) reflections, respectively. Normally, FAPbI3 has two isomers, including a black and yellow perovskite phase, with different crystal structures.30 The former perovskite phase corresponds to trigonal symmetry (P3m1), and its characteristic peaks are at 14.0°, 28.0°, 31.4°, 40.0°, 42.5°, which are similar with that of tetragonal MAPbI3. The latter phase is attributed to a P63mc layered crystal structure.23,24 Obviously, only the black phase can absorb adequate light to bring high efficiencies. It appears that the black P3m1 phase is stable at higher temperatures of 70 °C while it quickly and fully converts to the yellow phase in a humid atmosphere at room temperature.

FAPbI3 perovskite on the TiO2 film with a one-step spin-coating method changed to the dark colour at temperatures over 140 °C but with poor reproducibility. This high annealing temperature of the one-step spin-coating method may result in a poor crystal quality FAPbI3 perovskite layer, which may lead to deterioration of device performance once assembled into solar cells.24,27 Therefore, the sequential deposition method was used to fabricate the devices so as to decrease the fabrication temperature. In order to verify the crystalline situation in the devices, the XRD patterns of a blank TiO2/ZrO2/carbon film, PbI2 in a TiO2/ZrO2/carbon film, and MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 based cells prepared by the sequential deposition method were characterized. As illustrated in Fig. 2b, nearly all the PbI2 in the devices converts to MAPbI3 and FAPbI3. The diffraction peaks agree well with samples on the glass substrate. For FAPbI3 based cell, XRD reflections at 24.2°, 28.0°, 31.4°, 40.1°, and 42.7° are indexed to (202), (220), (222), (400), and (330) reflections, corresponding to the black polymorph of FAPbI3.27

Fig. 3a presents the absorption spectra of PbI2, MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 on TiO2 films prepared by the sequential deposition method. The PbI2 sample shows absorption in the visible region (λ < 500 nm), presenting a bright yellow colour. After dipping in a MAI or FAI solution, the films turned to a dark colour due to the formation of MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 perovskites, respectively. An obvious “cut-off” feature of FAPbI3 after 840 nm indicates that bandgap absorption arises at around 840 nm, corresponding to an energy of ca. 1.47 eV, which is in good agreement with previous observations.25 For MAPbI3, the onset of the absorption spectra is 800 nm, stemming from the larger band-gap of 1.55 eV.31 The lower bandgap of FAPbI3 makes it absorb light over 800 nm and convert a greater proportion of the sun's spectrum to current compared with MAPbI3. It is worth noting that the absorbance of FAPbI3 reduces faster than that of MAPbI3 in the range of 600 to 840 nm, suggesting a decreased light-harvesting ability in this range.27

Fig. 4a presents the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images from the cross section of the blank TiO2/ZrO2/carbon films. The thicknesses of TiO2 and ZrO2 layers are approximately 700 nm and 1.5 μm, respectively, while the thickness of the carbon layer is 10 μm. Fig. 4b and d show the cross section of the solar cell filled with FAPbI3 perovskite and the high magnification of the FAPbI3 coated TiO2/ZrO2 film, respectively. It is clear that the FAPbI3 perovskite is filled fully across the mesoporous TiO2 and ZrO2 layers, which makes it difficult to identify the boundary between the TiO2 and ZrO2 layers. This will result in an efficient electron transfer from the perovskite to TiO2 or across it.32Fig. 4c shows the morphology of the carbon layer without infiltrating perovskite on the top view. We can see that the large flaky graphite is well enclosed by the small carbon black particles and the thick porous carbon film adheres well to the ZrO2 layer. The rough mesoporous surface of the carbon CE will be beneficial for the infiltration of different sizes of cubic MAPbI3 or FAPbI3 perovskites.16

The J–V curves of the mesoscopic perovskite solar cells are shown in Fig. 5a and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. With a sequential deposition method, the MAPbI3 based device achieves a PCE of 10.4% with a Jsc of 17.5 mA cm−2, Voc of 928 mV, and fill factor (FF) of 0.70 at the light illumination of 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G. Under the same conditions, the FAPbI3 device shows a higher PCE of 11.9% with a Jsc of 18.4 mA cm−2, Voc of 901 mV and FF of 0.72. The increased efficiency should be mainly attributed to the increase of Jsc from 17.5 mA cm−2 to 18.4 mA cm−2, offsetting the 27 mV decrease in the Voc of the FAPbI3 based device. As presented by the IPCE spectra in Fig. 5b, the FAPbI3 perovskite solar cell successfully generates a photocurrent up to 840 nm, rather than only 800 nm achievable with the MAPbI3 perovskite, due to the narrower bandgap. The shapes of the IPCE spectra agree well with their absorption spectra, and IPCE reaches a maximum of over 65% in the range of 400–550 nm. The integration of the IPCE spectra gives 16.3 mA cm−2 for MAPbI3 and 17.3 mA cm−2 for FAPbI3, which is in rather good agreement with the Jsc obtained from the J–V curves. Note that IPCE is lower for FAPbI3 than for MAPbI3 at a wavelength longer than 600 nm, which should be mainly ascribed to the relatively weak light absorption by FAPbI3 in the long wavelength region compared to MAPbI3.

To compensate for the IPCE loss from 600–750 nm in FAPbI3 and further improve the efficiency of solar cells, FAI was mixed with MAI in solution to form (FA)x(MA)1−xPbI3 perovskite.26,27 The absorption spectra of (FA)x(MA)1−xPbI3 for various ratios in the range of 760 nm to 840 nm are presented in Fig. 3b. It is obvious that the absorption onset of the perovskite is gradually shifted to longer wavelengths as the content of FAI is increased. At the FAI/MAI ratio of 3:2 and 4:1, the films show broader light harvesting and higher absorbance with merits of both MAPbI3 and FAPbI3, inspiring us to improve the performance of the devices with mixed MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 perovskite. As shown in Fig. 5 and Table 1, with a FAI/MAI ratio of 3:2, namely, (FA)0.6(MA)0.4PbI3, a fully printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cell with a carbon CE shows the highest Jsc of 20.9 mA cm−2, with a Voc of 921 mV, FF of 0.67 and PCE of 12.9%. As far as we know, this is the highest efficiency of a hole-conductor-free, fully printable perovskite solar cell with a carbon CE. The increased PCE of the devices should be mainly attributed to the significantly increased Jsc relative to pure FAPbI3 and MAPbI3, while the high Voc and FF were nearly maintained. A hysteresis effect often appears during the measurement of the J–V curves of perovskite solar cells. For the mesoscopic solar cells with the sequential deposition method, one device based on (FA)0.6(MA)0.4PbI3 perovskite was carefully measured with different forward or backward scanning rates. The difference in efficiencies is lower than 1% between forward and backward scanning with a scan rate of no more than 250 mV s−1 (Fig. S1†). The IPCE of the cell with (FA)0.6(MA)0.4PbI3 in Fig. 5b exceeds the values of the two pure perovskites from 400 to 800 nm and the onset is between FAPbI3 and MAPbI3 in accordance with the absorbance spectra. Integration of the IPCE yields a Jsc of 20.1 mA cm−2 for (FA)0.6(MA)0.4PbI3.
To further investigate the charge transport process in the devices, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to measure FAPbI3 and (FA)0.6(MA)0.4PbI3 perovskite solar cells. Based on our previous report,15 there are two RC elements representing charge transfer resistance and recombination at the perovskite–CE and TiO2–perovskite interfaces in our EIS spectra. In the EIS measurements, when the forward applied bias decreased, the first semicircle in the high frequency region remained almost unchanged, while the second semicircle at low frequency increased in diameter, as shown in Fig. S2.†Fig. 6 shows the Nyquist plots of the devices based on FAPbI3 and (FA)0.6(MA)0.4PbI3, and the inset is the magnified version of the low impedance region. Similar semicircles at high frequency suggest similar charge transfer resistances at the perovskite–CE interface. Moreover, it can be seen that the radius of the semicircle in the low frequency is larger for the (FA)0.6(MA)0.4PbI3 based device compared with the FAPbI3 based device, which indicates less recombination at the TiO2–perovskite interface. This result corresponds to the Voc differences in Table 1. It was reported that when FAPbI3 and MAPbI3 were combined, the defects in the perovskite were reduced27 thus leading to less recombination. On the other hand, the conduction band of (FA)0.6(MA)0.4PbI3 is likely to increase due to a higher bandgap compared with pure FAPbI3 (indicated by the UV-visible absorption spectra), which in turn can lead to a reduced recombination and an increased Voc.

Conclusions
In summary, highly efficient hole-conductor-free mesoscopic perovskite solar cells with a carbon CE based on formamidinium lead iodide HC(NH2)2PbI3 were successfully fabricated. It is demonstrated that FAPbI3 successfully formed a cubic perovskite structure across the three mesoporous layers of the TiO2/ZrO2/carbon films characterized by XRD spectra. The pure FAPbI3 based solar cell showed an extended IPCE up to 840 nm. With the sequential deposition method, a high PCE of 11.9% was obtained for the FAPbI3 based solar cell. By optimizing the FAI/MAI mole ratio to 3:2, the Jsc was enhanced to 20.9 mA cm−2, which caused the PCE to increase to 12.9%. As far as we know, this is the highest efficiency of hole-conductor-free fully printable perovskite solar cells. Nevertheless, there still remains room for further substantial improvement in the photovoltaic parameters by doping or optimizing the structure of the devices. Finally, these results show that the fully printable fabrication process and low cost of these devices make them extremely promising in the future development and industrialization of photovoltaic cells.
