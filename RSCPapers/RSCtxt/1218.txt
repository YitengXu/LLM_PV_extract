    , Accepted 7th November 2013First published on 7th November 2013AbstractThe mesoporous Al2O3–In2O3 composites with one-dimensional (1D) nanofibres (NFs) have been fabricated via a facile one-step synthesis of the electrospinning approach, followed by appropriate thermal treatment under ambient conditions. The composite nanomaterials display high dispersion of both In2O3 and Al2O3, forming a heterostructure and mesoporous tubular structure in a broad Al:In atomic ratio up to 1:4. It has been found that the Al2O3 composite tube-like nanostructures not only increase efficient sites for gas adsorption, but also possess higher donor densities. Moreover, the mesoporous structure also provides effective and fast channels for fast capturing and migration of electrons. The results show that the mesoporous Al2O3–In2O3 nanotubes exhibit excellent sensing properties to NOx down to a detection limit of 291 ppb at room temperature (RT), while containing 20 at% Al2O3 (labeled as meso-20AI NTs) with an average diameter of nanoparticles of about 10 nm. With respect to the 97 ppm NOx, the maximum response of 100 was determined, 7.3 times as high as the pure In2O3 NTs. Owing to its unique composite structure, 1D meso-20AI NTs may be promising for application in gas sensors.
Introduction
Gas sensors are very important in many fields, such as industrial emission, household security, vehicle emission control, environmental monitoring and public health. Among them, NO and NO2 (NOx) sensors have attracted great attention, since NOx are the most dangerous air pollutants affecting human health and the environment. Moreover, the exhaled concentration of NO has been identified as a biomarker for airway inflammation such as asthma and bronchiectasis. Generally, the exhaled NO level of the patients with asthma1 is about 34.7–51.1 ppb. Therefore, it is necessary to develop rugged and reliable NO gas sensors to detect very low gas concentrations. It is also highly demanded by public health and security applications.
Most NOx gas sensors are semiconductor oxides, such as SnO2, ZnO, In2O3,2etc. They usually require a certain working-temperature or doped with noble metals such as Pd.3 Xu et al. reported that high aspect ratio In2O3 nanowires are very sensitive to NO2 at 250 °C.2 Chen et al. reported that the SnO2 nanocrystal–MWCNT gas sensor displayed a sensitivity of 1 for 200 ppm NO2 at RT.4 Marzbanrad and co-workers studied the sensors based on In2O3-nanoparticles for 500 ppb NO2 at 150 °C, 200 °C and 250 °C.5 Rao et al. studied the NO2 and N2O sensors of In2O3 nanowires at 150 °C and came to the limit of detection at 0.1 ppm.6 Nomani et al. reported a detection limit of 700 ppb for pure In2O3 thin films.7 Although the introduction of noble metals can effectively lower the operating temperature and increase sensitivity, the high price and the low stability still limit the appeal of NOx sensors. So, it is of importance to investigate low-cost and ambient operation NOx gas sensors with low gas concentrations and fast response. Operation of gas sensors at RT would be more suitable for future applications.
As is well known, semiconducting indium oxide has widely been studied from fundamental and technological levels and it has been widely applied in electronics/displays, catalysts, solar cells8 and gas sensors for the detection of HCHO,9 C2H5OH,10 NH3,11 CO (ref.12) and H2S.13 Lee et al. studied the sensing response of pure and additive (Sb, Cu, Nb, Pd, and Ni)-loaded In2O3 hollow spheres to NH3, H2S, H2, CO and CH4 at 371 °C and 440 °C.14
However, it is difficult for a single oxide based semiconductor gas sensor to satisfy all practical requests: high sensitivity, fast response, stability, and low energy consumption. To overcome these drawbacks, sensors based on two or more components have been explored for well-designed nanostructures, optimized components and well-fabricated heterojunction interactions between these components.15,16 The study by Ho et al. on NOx sensing with In2O3–ZnO nanostructures indicated that good sensitivity could be achieved only at elevated temperature (∼150 °C).1 Cui et al. detected NO2 down to 300 ppb in air using In2O3–SnO2 nanohybrids at RT,17 but the recovery process of the sensor was quite slow (∼600 s).
As mentioned above, the preparation of doped In2O3 shows great promise as a new class of materials for gas-sensors. However, they only exhibit higher sensitivity at desired working temperature. So far, reports on reliable, reproducible, and fast-responding/recovery NOx sensors with high sensitivity at RT remain rare. In order to solve the above problems, the identification of the most potential additive candidate is becoming a key problem to be solved as soon as possible.
To the best of our knowledge, easily available Al2O3 usually serves as a typical NOx storage and reduction catalyst support. It has been found to play an important role in a NOx storage and adsorption site.18 Previous studies showed that Al2O3 decorated TiO2 nanotubes templated by anodic aluminium oxide is a NOx gas sensor at RT.19 However, the synthesis includes many complicated steps, which restricts the use of Al2O3 in gas sensors. The Al-doped ZnO nanostructure has been proposed as a sensing material for CO detection at 150 °C,20 but the Al-doped sensors usually have high-temperature operation. Therefore, it is still a challenge to develop the Al2O3-doped sensors using a facile and low-cost synthetic method.
In this work, we targeted inexpensive Al2O3 as an additive of appropriate electrical conductivity to improve gas sensing of materials, and suggested a one-step method to fabricate 1D mesoporous Al2O3–In2O3 NFs. We have considered their different atomic ratios of directly annealing electrospuning composite fibers obtained from a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) solution. Heterostructures were constructed by controlling In2O3 and Al2O3 crystalline particles. This inhibits the grain growth and enhances NOx gas sensing performance. Meanwhile, the amount of Al2O3 incorporated into In2O3 NFs was changed. The effect of mesoporous structure on the gas sensing performance was investigated. The as-fabricated meso-20AI NTs with high surface-to-volume ratios exhibit high response, fast response and low detecting limit of NOx down to ppb levels at RT. Therefore, the Al2O3–In2O3 composites sensoring NOx display great potential for practical applications.
Experimental
Sample preparation
The Al2O3–In2O3 composite NFs were synthesized by electrospinning PVP (MW = 1300000, Aldrich) solution (9 wt%). And then, an annealing process was performed. In a typical process, PVP was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and ethanol. After that, 0.4 g of indium nitrate hydrate was added to all samples to obtain a transparent precursor solution. Different amounts of aluminium nitrate were added in the precursor solution to let the atomic ratios of In and Al reach 100:0, 100:15, 100:20 and 100:25, respectively. The mixed solution was stirred vigorously at 60 °C for at least 6 h and transferred into a 10 ml syringe with a capillary tip (0.8 mm in diameter) for spinning. A high voltage of 15 kV was applied at the spinneret by a direct-current power supply (BGG, Beijing Electro-mechanical Research Institute Supervoltage Technique Co., China). The solution was pushed out of the spinneret by a syringe pump (LSP02-1B, Baoding Lange Constant Flux Pump Co., China) at a rate of 0.25 ml h−1, and the NFs were collected using the aluminium foil at RT. After spinning, the Al2O3–In2O3 NFs with different atomic ratios were treated at 550 °C for 4 h in air with a heating rate of 1 °C min−1. The Al2O3–In2O3 composite NFs with the atomic ratios of In and Al about 100:0, 100:15, 100:20 and 100:25 were labeled as pure In2O3 NTs, meso-15AI NTs, meso-20AI NTs and meso-25AI NRs, respectively.
Material characterizations
The crystal phase of samples was characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, D/max-IIIB-40 kV, Japan, Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5406 Å). The morphologies and structures of the Al2O3–In2O3 NFs were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, HITACHIS-4800) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL-2100). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of the products was measured by N2 adsorption–desorption (Quantachrome Instruments, USA). The sample was dried for 10 h at 150 °C under vacuum before the measurement. X-Ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded with a AXIS Ultra DLD (Shimadzu Corporation) system equipped to analyse the adsorbed oxygen species of Al2O3–In2O3 composite NFs.
Gas sensing tests
An alumina substrate (99.6%, 7 × 5 × 0.38 mm) with two interdigitated Au electrodes on its top surface was used. Each Au electrode contained 100 fingers which interleaved each other, and the distance between two fingers was 20 μm. The sample materials were spin-coated onto the interdigital electrode to form a sensitive film and then dried at 70 °C for 5 h to obtain a gas sensor. The sensor was installed into a test chamber with an inlet and an outlet. The electrical resistance measurements of the sensor were carried out at RT and a relative humidity (RH) around 42%. The NOx gas concentration was controlled by injecting a volume of the gas and the chamber was purged with air to recover the sensor resistance. The gas response is defined as the ratio (Rg − Ra)/Ra, where Ra and Rg are the resistances measured in air and the tested gas atmosphere.
Results and discussion
Composition and morphology

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the samples, which were prepared with different atomic ratios of In:Al after the final heat treatment at 550 °C for 4 h, respectively. The diffraction main peaks around 21.53°, 30.62°, 35.50°, 51.05° and 60.69° can be indexed as cubic (211), (222), (400), (440) and (622) planes with d spacing of 4.13, 2.92, 2.53, 1.79 and 1.53 Å lattice parameters of a = b = c = 10.11 Å (JCPDS card no. 71-2195), respectively. This indicates the formation of the cubic structure of In2O3. It can also be seen that the weak peaks around 25.8° and 34.9° are the (012) and (104) facets of the Al2O3 (JCPDS card no. 88-0826) and emerged upon the content of Al2O3-composite at 20 at% and 25 at%. This case may be due to the content of Al2O3-composite at 15 at% being too small to detect in the crystal structure. Obviously, the Al2O3 peaks are weaker than those of In2O3, in accordance with the presence of small quantities of Al2O3. Other impurity peaks are not observed in Fig. 1, which indicates the high purity of the products.

In addition, Fig. 1 shows a decrease of crystallinity in the Al2O3–In2O3 composite NFs in comparison with the pure In2O3 sample. The XRD measurements of Al2O3–In2O3 composite NFs presenting the crystalline grain sizes are the biggest in the pure In2O3 sample (see Fig. 1a). The high Al2O3-composite samples display the broader full width at half maximum of In2O3 peaks when the Al2O3 content is 20%. Then the crystalline grain sizes of Al2O3–In2O3 composite NFs decreased when increasing the Al2O3 content. This demonstrates that the Al2O3 additive has an effect on the size of the In2O3 nanoparticles in NFs.
It is known that, the ion radius of Al3+ at about 53.5 pm is much smaller than that of In3+ at about 80 pm. Therefore, Al3+ could enter the lattice of In2O3. Because of the interference of Al3+ with the In2O3 lattice, the crystallinity of In2O3 nanoparticles composited with Al2O3 was smaller than that of pure In2O3. This implies that the Al2O3 may form a stable solid. It could restrain the size of In2O3 crystal nanoparticles.

Fig. 2 and S1† illustrate the SEM and TEM images of the as-synthesized Al2O3–In2O3 composite NFs with different atomic ratios after calcination at 550 °C for 4 h. It can be seen from Fig. 2 that all NFs are composed of small nanocrystallites. The one-dimensional uniform Al2O3–In2O3 composite nanotubes (NTs) are distributed all around. The SEM images indicate that the pure In2O3 sample and the content of Al2O3-composite at 15 at% or 20 at% samples show a tubular morphology. As shown in Fig. S1,† the size of the In2O3 nanoparticles of pure In2O3 NTs is in the range of 30–50 nm, which is the biggest among the four samples. The open end of Al2O3–In2O3 composite NTs can also be observed clearly in Fig. 2c. The magnification SEM image of Al2O3–In2O3 composite NTs is shown in the inset of Fig. 2c. And the morphology of the content of the Al2O3-composite at 25 at% is the nanorods (NRs).

From the SEM image of Fig. 2d, the rough surface of Al2O3–In2O3 composite NRs with diameters of about 200 nm can be observed due to the removal of PVP. And the NRs consist of small nanoparticles. Fig. 2 and S1† indicate that the morphologies and grain size distribution of composite NFs are greatly influenced by the additive amount of Al2O3. In addition, a possible formation mechanism of hollow NFs had been proposed. The formation of the NTs could be like this:21 when the heating rate is high enough (1 °C min−1), the expansion of gas produced by the PVP decomposition plays a more important role than the shrinkage during sintering. Eventually, hollow tubes were obtained.
The structure and morphology of the meso-20AI NTs were investigated by TEM. The strong contrast between the dark edges and the light center within the TEM images in Fig. 3a and b gives evidence for their hollow feature. It is apparent that the calcinated Al2O3–In2O3 composite NFs are uniform NTs with diameters of about 200 nm. Due to the fact that the final thermal treatment is performed at 550 °C for 4 h in air, the grains are connected with each other (see Fig. 3c–e).

As shown in Fig. 3a, the size of the In2O3 nanoparticles is in the range of 8–13 nm, which means that the small nanoparticles could have higher surface-to-volume ratios22,23 and larger active surfaces.24 Moreover, such small nanoparticles show the presence of many defects (see Fig. 3c–e),25 which could enhance the property of gas sensing.
To further investigate the structure of the meso-20AI NTs, HRTEM images have been obtained. The lattice planes continuously extend in each nanocrystal and the lattice fringes are clear in Fig. 3c–e. The average distance between the adjacent lattice fringes is around 0.292, 0.253 and 0.179 nm, which corresponds to the d spacing of the (222), (400) and (440) planes of cubic In2O3, respectively. Fig. 3d and e show that the average distance between the adjacent lattice fringes is around 0.348 nm, which is assigned to the (012) planes of Al2O3.
Furthermore, Fig. 3a presents the detailed information of the structure. There are lots of loose pores with an approximate size of several nanometers in the body of the NTs because of the removal and decomposition of PVP, which greatly improve the surface-to-volume ratios of In2O3 NTs. The BET surface area of the meso-20AI NTs was measured, as shown in Fig. 3f. It can be seen that a type-IV isotherm with a hysteresis loop from 0.2 to 1.0 (P/P0) is clearly presented. The BET surface area is found to be 53.7 m2 g−1. The inset of Fig. 3f is the pore size distribution curve. According to the pore size distribution curve, the meso-20AI NTs contain a mass of mesopores, which are in the range of 2–50 nm and dominated at about 7.6 nm. These mesopores may be due to the accumulation of particles. Such a feature is consistent with pores aggregated from nano-grains, observed by TEM (Fig. 3a). This implies that the mesopores are greatly advantageous for gas adsorption–desorption and gas molecular diffusion.

Fig. 4 shows the elemental map of the meso-20AI NT. Fig. 4a is a bright field image of the meso-20AI NT. Fig. 4b–d reveal the existence of In, Al, and O elements, respectively. It is clear to see that the distribution of the In, Al and O elements is uniform throughout the whole meso-20AI NT. This demonstrates that the Al2O3 additive can highly disperse on the surface of the meso-20AI NT.

Sensor performance
The 1D structure and the specific compositions of semi-conductor materials might be advantageous for gas-sensing applications.26,27 Therefore, we investigated the sensing performance of the fabricated Al2O3–In2O3 composite NFs with different atomic ratios towards NOx in air at RT. Fig. 5 and S2† depict the representative dynamic gas response of the Al2O3–In2O3 composite NF sensor on the NOx concentrations ranging 0.291–97 ppm at RT. It can be seen that, the resistance undergoes a drastic rise upon the injection of NOx gas and a decline to its initial value after exposing sensors to air for some time to all the samples. The response of the different sensors changes with the alteration of the NOx gas concentration. The comparison results of the response of Al2O3–In2O3 composite NFs with different atomic ratios are listed in Table S1.†
 Fig. 5  Dynamic response–recovery curves of the Al2O3–In2O3 composite NF sensor to 0.291–97 ppm NOx at RT in air (a) meso-20AI NTs; (b) bar graph representing the gas responses of the Al2O3–In2O3 composite NFs with different atomic ratios (RH: 42%). 
As can be seen in Fig. 5b and Table S1,† the lowest detectable NOx concentration of the meso-20AI NT sensor is down to 0.291 ppm. The response can also reach 0.74 within the response time of 24 s. The other Al2O3–In2O3 composite NF sensors cannot reach the lowest level of the meso-20AI NTs. For the meso-20AI NTs, the response time to 97, 48.5 and 29.1 ppm NOx is 28, 9 and 10 s, respectively. The maximum response to 97 ppm NOx was 100, which is the highest among the four sensors. The response time to 0.97 ppm NOx was 10 s and the response was 5.86, which is more than 2.3 times higher than the response of In2O3 nanowires to 1 ppm NO2 at 250 °C.2 Simultaneously, it is also higher than the SnO2 TONTs and CaO–SnO2 L-NR sensors, as described in our previous work.28,29 These response characteristics are closely related to the structure and morphology.
It can be seen that, the pure In2O3 NT sensor displays the lowest response (see Fig. 5b and Table S1†) and the longest response time among the four samples. And the response performance of the Al2O3–In2O3 composite NF sensor decreases in the order of meso-20AI NTs > meso-25AI NRs > meso-15AI NTs > pure In2O3 NTs > porous pure Al2O3 NRs; the response time increase in the order of pure In2O3 NTs > meso-25AI NRs > meso-15AI NTs > meso-20AI NTs > porous pure Al2O3 NRs. In comparison with other samples, the sensor based on the meso-20AI NT sample exhibits relatively higher response and shorter response time at RT (though the response time of porous pure Al2O3 NR is the fastest, its response is too low, i.e. the response to 97 ppm NOx is 0.46).
In addition, the selectivity of the meso-20AI NT sensor had been tested at different concentrations of various gases, such as, NH3, CO and H2. As shown in Fig. S3,† the sensor shows the highest response to NOx at RT. It could be concluded that the meso-20AI NT sensor has an obvious selectivity, indicative of a good NOx sensor. The stability of the meso-20AI NT thin film sensor is measured at different NOx concentrations for 35 days. As shown in Fig. 6, the response to 9.70, 4.85 and 0.97 ppm NOx remains constant for almost 35 days at RT. This conforms the good stability of the meso-20AI NT sensor.
 Fig. 6  Curves of the stability test of the gas response for the meso-20AI NT thin film sensor to 0.97–9.7 ppm NOx at RT in air (RH: 42%). 
From all the above, it is clear that the meso-20AI NT sensor prepared by the electrospinning method exhibits excellent sensing properties. The sensor has high response property, selectivity and excellent stability in air for 0.291–97 ppm NOx detection at RT.
Discussion of sensing mechanism
The sensing mechanism of the Al2O3–In2O3 composite NFs to NOx was proposed based on its structure and composition. Considering the porosity of the 1D Al2O3–In2O3 composite NFs and Al2O3 modification behavior, the discussion on the mechanism consists of: (i) the relationship among the pore structure, diffusion and the sorption–desorption of gas onto the surface of the Al2O3–In2O3 composite NFs; (ii) the role of the Al2O3 additive on the sensor characteristics of the meso-20AI NTs.
It is well known that the working principle of gas sensing materials is built on the measurement of gas adsorption and the changes of the conductivity caused by the surface reaction process. Therefore, the increased surface area, chemisorbed oxygen and resistance can improve the response performance. Amongst the Al2O3–In2O3 composite NFs, the meso-20AI NT gas sensor shows the high response of gas sensing property at RT. In order to explain the phenomenon, the pore structure, chemisorbed oxygen species and resistance of samples were studied, which is shown in Fig. 3f, S4,†7–9.
 Fig. 7  The response–recovery curve of the Al2O3–In2O3 composite NFs with different atomic ratios toward 97 ppm NOx at RT, the four lines correspond to the four SEM images marked by a, b, c and d, respectively. 
The N2 sorption–desorption isotherms of the four samples are type IV isotherms. The four samples include pure In2O3 NTs, meso-15AI NTs, meso-20AI NTs and meso-25AI NRs. Their BET specific surface areas are about 21.1, 37.4, 53.3, and 44.1 m2 g−1 with total pore volumes of 0.0966, 0.132, 0.151 and 0.122 cm3 g−1, respectively. According to the pore size distribution curve, all the four samples possess a lot of mesopores in the range of 2–50 nm. Pure In2O3 NTs have about 5.6 nm dominated mesopores; mesopores of meso-15AI NTs, meso-20AI NTs and meso-25AI NRs are about 3.8, 7.6 and 6.5 nm, respectively. Comparatively the meso-20AI NTs possess the largest surface area and total pore volumes. These are greatly advantageous for gas adsorption–desorption and gas molecular diffusion. And these structures provide numerous active sites for surface contact reactions.30
In addition, the meso-20AI NTs feature the unique mesoporous 1D hollow composite structure, allowing for adsorption of NOx gas not only on the outer/inner of the tubular surfaces but also throughout the mesoporous wall. The sensitivity of nanostructured metal-oxide gas sensors scales with the surface to volume ratio.31 Therefore, the fact that this ratio is twice as large for hollow fibers as for NRs of the same diameter can enable the NOx molecule adequately to utilize every In2O3 or Al2O3 nanocrystals. As a result, the meso-20AI NT sensor exhibits not only high response performance, but also fast response at RT to the NOx concentrations ranging from 0.291 to 97 ppm for detection.

Fig. 7 shows the typical response curves of the four sensors to NOx (97 ppm) at RT in air for one circle. The response of the pure In2O3 NTs, meso-15AI NTs, meso-20AI NTs and meso-25AI NRs to 97 ppm NOx are 13.7, 18.3, 100, 29.1 and 247, 32, 28, 56 s, respectively. The response of meso-20AI NTs is 7.3, 5.5 and 3.4 times as high as those of pure In2O3 NTs, meso-15AI NTs and meso-25AI NRs, respectively. The meso-20AI NT sensor has a better sensing performance than other sensors. Why is the gas sensing performance of the meso-20AI NT sensor so much better than those of the pure In2O3 NTs, meso-15AI NTs or meso-25AI NRs? And what role does the Al2O3 additive play?
In general, the role and activity of catalytic additives on solid-state gas sensors are determined by the additive chemical state, aggregation form and interaction with the semiconductor oxide.32 Here, the Al2O3 additive can modify the microstructure of the base material, control the grain growth, introduce donor levels and change resistance. All these may also have an important effect on the NOx sensor characteristics.
As shown in Fig. 2, 3 and S1,† the size of the In2O3 particles on the meso-20AI NTs is much smaller than that of the pure In2O3 NTs (30–50 nm). This means that a large fraction of the atoms is present on the surface of the composite, leading to high surface-to-volume ratios and larger active surfaces.23 Consequently, the property of gas sensing will be enhanced. Also Fig. 3b–d show that the overlapped parts of In2O3 grains contain a lot of defects. According to the UV-vis diffuse absorption spectra (Fig. S5†), the estimated band gap of pure In2O3 NTs and the meso-20AI NTs by the Kubelka–Munk function is 2.8 and 2.6 eV, respectively. The band gap of the meso-20AI NTs is slightly smaller than that of pure In2O3 NTs, which can be attributed to surface defects. And the defects might be the vacancies of oxygen/defects. As a result, the surface-related defects are the best condition to the absorption of O2− and O− for gas detection.33
The XPS results of Fig. 8 confirm the above speculation. The O 1s peak was fitted by three Gaussian simulation peaks. The peak centered at 529.2 ± 0.1 eV (marked as Oc) is attributed to the O2− ions in In2O3 and Al2O3. The Ob peak at 530 ± 0.1 eV corresponds to the oxygen deficiency regions, which are the so-called oxygen vacancies. The peak at 531.4 ± 0.1 eV, labeled as Oa, is usually assigned to the near-surface oxygen, the chemisorbed oxygen of O2−, O− and OH−etc.34
 Fig. 8  XPS spectra of the O 1s of (a) pure In2O3 NTs, (b) meso-15AI NTs, (c) meso-20AI NTs and (d) meso-25AI NRs. 
It can be seen that, all the chemisorbed oxygen peaks of the meso-15AI NT, meso-20AI NT and meso-25AI NR samples are more intense than the ones of the pure In2O3 NTs. In addition, the calculated oxygen vacancy/defect (Ob peaks area) of the four samples (the pure In2O3 NTs, meso-15AI NTs, meso-20AI NTs and meso-25AI NRs) are about 23.3, 23.4, 27.9 and 27.0%, respectively. In brief, the peak area of the oxygen vacancy/defect of the meso-20AI NTs is the largest, since the oxygen vacancies/defects are taken as shallow donors35 (see Scheme 1c and d). That means the more oxygen vacancies there are, the more donors exist in the meso-20AI NTs. This implies that adding Al2O3 could increase donors and chemisorbed oxygen. Chemisorbed oxygen is suggested to act as an electron donor, and can be defined as an n-type semiconductor.36 Hence, both oxygen vacancy and chemisorbed oxygen are helpful for good catalytic activity in gas sensors and improve the performance of NOx sensors.

Moreover, the enhanced NOx sensing performance of Al2O3–In2O3 composites could be attributed to the appropriate additive amount of Al2O3 and the formation of the Al2O3–In2O3 heterostructure. Meanwhile, it is also crucial for the distribution and extent of electrically active contacts between Al2O3 and In2O3 in the composites. Hence, in order to examine the doping effect on the gas sensing performance, we measured the carrier concentrations of the two samples by the Mott–Schottky (MS) method. Obtainable results are shown in Fig. 9a. The MS curves of pure In2O3 NTs and the meso Al2O3–In2O3 NTs are approximately linear. The two samples exhibit a positive slope in the MS plots and n-type semiconducting behavior. The lower the slope in a MS plot is, the higher the carrier concentrations.37 We obtained the carrier densities of the pure In2O3 and meso-20AI NTs to be 2.04 × 1018 and 2.45 × 1018 respectively by the following equation (1/C2)/V = 2/(qε0εrND),38 where 1/C2, q, ε0, εr and ND represent the slope of MS plots, the elementary electric charge (1.60 × 10−19 C), vacuum permittivity (8.85 × 10−14 F cm−1), relative permittivity of In2O3 (8.9) and the concentration of donor impurities.

Therefore, MS studies showed that the meso-20AI NT sample has much higher donor densities than the pure In2O3 NTs. This demonstrates that an n–n homotype heterostructure is formed at the interface of the meso-20AI NT sample by adding Al2O3. As shown in Fig. S2d,† porous pure Al2O3 displays the behavior of an n-type semiconductor. That is, addition of a 20 at% Al2O3 additive into In2O3 might form the donor energy level being located below the conduction band. This enables easy transfer of electrons to the conduction band (see Scheme 1c). Furthermore, the Al2O3 additive is uniformly dispersed on the surface of the In2O3 based NTs (in Fig. 4). Thus, O2 or NOx molecules can easily capture and migrate electrons from the conduction band or the donor energetic level of the meso-20AI NTs. The results unambiguously indicate that the Al2O3–In2O3 composite can significantly improve the electrical conductivity (or resistance), resulting in the meso-20AI NT gas sensor, which shows the high response of gas sensing property at RT.
Accordingly, we could conclude that the resistance of materials in the air plays a key role in their responses. Larger resistance in air induces higher response. Thus, the resistance of the samples in air was studied, which is shown in Fig. 9b. The resistance of the two samples presents identical change as the heating temperature increases. It is attributed to the semiconducting electronic transport behavior. It could be found that, the meso-20AI NTs clearly have higher resistance than pure In2O3 NTs. It could be assessed that the meso-20AI NTs had higher surface activity, because surface-bound oxygen atoms were able to abstract the electrons easier from the material. The surface electron potential barrier increased, causing the increase of the resistance of materials in air. Thereby the gas sensing performance of the material was enhanced. It agrees with the XPS results.
The model is introduced to explain the sensing mechanism in Scheme 1. The electron transport and the NOx gas response in the meso-20AI NTs are as follows:
Firstly, when the meso-20AI NT sensor (see Scheme 1a) is exposed to air, oxygen might be adsorbed on the outer/inner layer of the tubular surfaces and throughout the mesoporous wall (Scheme 1b(1)).
Secondly, oxygen molecules can easily trap the free electrons from their conduction band or donor level to form oxygen ions or chemisorbed oxygen (O2− or O−). As shown in Scheme 1b(2), the negative charge trapped in these oxygen species causes a depletion layer. Such chemisorbed oxygen is suggested to act as an electron donor, which depends strongly on the electrical conductivity (resistance) of the material. The formation of numerous oxygen species (O2− or O−) is known for their good catalytic activity in gas sensors.
Thirdly, when NOx gas is injected into the meso-20AI NT sensor, the gas molecules tend to attract the electrons from the conduction band or the donor of the meso-20AI NTs because of the high electron affinity of the NOx molecules. This makes electrons transfer from the meso-20AI NT sensor to surface adsorbates NOx, as shown in Scheme 1b(3). At the same time, the chemical interaction between indium oxide and NOx as well as stipulated change of defect concentration might happen.7 The process traps electrons from the conduction band or donor level of the meso-20AI NTs, which finally leads to a decrease of electron density (see Scheme 1c). The adsorption of NO2 on the meso-20AI NTs leads to NO2− and the adsorption of NO forms NO−. The negative charge trapped in these NO−/NO2− results in an increase of the thicknesses of depletion regions and the resistance (see Fig. 5 and Scheme 1b(3)). Besides, the target gas molecules NO2 and NO are directly adsorbed onto the meso-20AI NTs, then react with O2−/O− and later on generate bidentate NO3− (s) and generate NO2−.39
Fourthly, the chamber was purged with air to recover the meso-20AI NT sensor resistance (Scheme 1b(4)).
In Scheme 1c, the donor energy level being located below the conduction band might be formed by the oxygen vacancies/defects which is contributed by the Al2O3 additive. Scheme 1d and Fig. 3c–e show the presence of many defects between Al2O3 and In2O3 grains.
Conclusion
The mesoporous Al2O3–In2O3 composite NFs were fabricated via a one-step synthesis of the electrospinning process. The morphology varies from NTs to NRs with increasing the added Al2O3 amount. Among them, the mesoporous Al2O3–In2O3 NTs containing 20 at% Al2O3 (meso-20AI NTs) exhibit excellent sensing properties to NOx detection at RT: high response of 100 to 97 ppm NOx, the detection limit of 291 ppb, and the high stability to 0.97–9.7 ppm NOx that remains constant in the response and response time for 35 days.
The enhanced gas sensing could be attributed to the synergistic effect between 1D mesoporous tubular structure and Al2O3 modification role: (1) the mesopores and unique 1D hollow structure with high surface-to-volume ratio can act as channels for gas adsorption–desorption and diffusion. And thus it provides more approachable active sites for the reaction of NOx with surface-adsorbed oxygen ions. Eventually, the favorable response to NOx at RT was effected. (2) The high response of the meso-20AI NTs may be attributed to the modification role of Al2O3. Namely, the Al2O3 additive can increase the oxygen vacancy/defect and donor densities, control the grain growth and resistivity and provide more activity sites (O−, O2−). This results in fast capturing and migration of electrons from the conduction band or donor level.
In summary, the excellent gas sensing properties of the mesoporous tube-like structure of the meso-20AI NTs can be a reference for the preparation of other semiconductors for sensor applications, especially in the lower concentration range, less than 97 ppm (∼291 ppb) at RT.
