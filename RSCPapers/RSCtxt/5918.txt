To address the above issues, here we introduce the co-electro-deposition strategy, which is able to prepare an electrode material with a high areal capacitance (1670 mF cm−2 at 0.5 mA cm−2), a high areal mass (8.5 mg cm−2), an excellent mechanical robustness, a high through-put and great convenience even on a piece of a ubiquitous stainless steel mesh current collector. Based on this advancement, we are able to obtain an ultrathin (less than 200 μm) aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor device with a high energy density (1.8 × 10−3 W h cm−3), a high power density (0.38 W cm−3 at 3.62 × 10−4 W h cm−3) and an excellent rate capability. This energy storage device is integrated into a prototype smart card to drive a light emitting diode (LED) indicator, which is charged for 5 seconds and can light up the indicator for more than 2 hours, demonstrating great promise in miniaturized novel flexible energy storage devices.1 IntroductionFor the blooming wearable and rolling-up consumer electronics, e.g. electronic papers, collapsible displays, and flexible tablet PCs etc., bulky battery packs are no longer applicable since they are rigid giant components which occupy a large volume of the total device. To address this issue, materials scientists and engineers have been conducting research into the design and fabrication of novel miniaturized power sources with superior electrochemical properties and many others, e.g. lightweight, flexibility, high mechanical integrity upon bending and rolling, and a fast charging character.1,2 Recently, significant advances have been made in this area. For example, El-Kady et al. have fabricated high-power graphene micro-supercapacitors for flexible energy storage3 and Jung et al. have used carbon films to make a transparent, flexible supercapacitor.4 Also, some novel, flexible and high-performance batteries have been made.5–8Supercapacitors (or ultracapacitors, electrochemical capacitors) exhibit a series of advantages as compared with batteries, such as a high power density, a long cycle life and a fast charge–discharge rate within seconds. They also can be totally made of non-toxic materials, do not combust when punctured and are highly reliable.9,10 Moreover, supercapacitors can be fabricated into thin and small configurations in more simple processing methods and can be paired with energy conversion devices such as thermoelectrics, solar panels and piezoelectrics to build up self-powered devices.11 Yet they are facing a few challenges e.g. they have a low working voltage and a low energy density.In order to improve the electrode capacitance, pseudocapacitive materials are being investigated, such as RuO2, MnO2,12,13 NiO and Co3O4etc. Among the transition-metal oxides, MnO2 is generally considered to be one of the most promising candidates because of its high theoretical specific capacitance (as high as 1370 F g−1), low cost, environmentally friendliness and abundance in nature.10,14 However, the poor electrical conductivity of MnO2 (10−5 to 10−6 S cm−1) results in a low gravimetric capacitance (50–250 F g−1) and thus hinders the wide application in energy storage systems.14–17 An effective strategy is to combine MnO2 with conductive materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, and carbon nanofibers (CNFs) etc.,12,18–20 and intrinsic conductive polymers e.g. polypyrrole (PPy), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT),21 poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)12,22 and polyanilline (PANI). For example, our group recently studied the combination of MnO2 with PANI to improve the electrochemical performance;23 some other groups investigated the effects of wrapping the MnO2–graphene nanostructures with conductive polymers.24 Benefits from this material combination include a higher specific capacitance with a higher MnO2 loading content compared to the traditional carbon based composites. However, due to the limited mixing efficiency, a large amount of conductive materials (e.g. carbon and conductive polymers) are necessary in the metal oxide composite, and thus the capacitance of the electrode is compromised.25 On the other hand, binder materials such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) are needed to improve the mechanical strength and cohesiveness, since it has no contribution to either conductivity and capacitance, the electrode performance is further inhibited.10 Also, for preparing the thin film electrodes, the conventional dispensing and printing methods for the electrode materials suffer from a weak contact at the interface and often result in mechanical failure upon bending.When considering the disadvantages of conventional combination methods,12 the development of novel electrode preparation methods becomes urgently necessary. In comparison, electrodeposition and electrophoretic deposition (EPD) methods are more advantageous since they are both scalable and inexpensive techniques in industrial process which can result in very uniform films.26,27 Yet it is comparatively time consuming to obtain thick films of the active mass based on these methods due to the weak electrical conductivity of the metal oxides;8 for example, in a most recent report, it takes more than 1400 minutes (about one day) to electrodeposit 10 mg cm−2 of MnO2 onto the substrates,26 which is impractical in preparing composite electrodes with a high mass loading, which is critical to the areal capacitance of the supercapacitor. Within the same area of footprint, the electrode which has a high areal capacitance can store more charges and this character is crucial in the miniaturization of the energy storage device for gadget applications.28Herein we first report the co-electro-deposition of a uniform MnO2–PEDOT:PSS nanostructured composite electrode for use in a supercapacitor. This scheme does provide a large areal capacitance (1670 mF cm−2). Even though the areal capacitance is not the highest compared with some 3D structured electrodes,29,30 it is much higher than most supercapacitors based on a metal substrate.31–33 Different from any published report, this manuscript discloses an effective method, using a cheap and common composite, i.e. MnO2–PEDOT:PSS to demonstrate the new idea, that a high areal capacitance up to 1670 mF cm−2 can be achieved even on low specific surface area substrates. The scheme also shows a scalable process to obtain thicker films of the active mass (over 8 mg cm−2 within 20 minutes). Moreover, this concept does not conflict with those methods which achieve a high areal capacitance due to using 3D porous substrates. We select an asymmetric supercapacitor structure as the motif for study, which renders a high working potential and high power density. Briefly, MnO2 and a small dose of PEDOT:PSS are simultaneously deposited onto a piece of metal current collector (stainless steel mesh) in an aqueous stock solution containing both PEDOT:PSS and Mn2+. PEDOT:PSS acts as both the conductive additive and the polymer binder, and it is uniformly combined with MnO2 during the anode deposition process of Mn2+. The deposition of PEDOT:PSS, on the other hand, is driven by EPD, which is a physical process instead. We found that even though PEDOT:PSS is as less as 9.9 wt% in the composite (in other words, over 90 wt% of the electrode material is MnO2), it effectively controls the thickness of the composite film and drastically improves both the electrochemical properties as well as the mechanical robustness. For the current collector material, we adopt the commercial stainless steel mesh substrate (64 μm in thickness) due to its stable superficial area, low cost, strong impact resistance, superior chemical stability and high electrical conductivity. With the above basic design, the as-prepared composite is robust enough to resist the peeling force without the addition of any binder, exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance and is featured with a very low cost. In the following paragraphs, we would like to give a detailed elucidation of this new material and demonstrate its application in fabricating an ultrathin asymmetric supercapacitor which can drive a prototype smart card.2 Experimental2.1 Preparation of the MnO2–PEDOT:PSS nanostructured composite electrodeThe MnO2–PEDOT:PSS composite was synthesized by anode deposition and EPD on a piece of stainless steel wire mesh. Prior to deposition, the stainless steel wire mesh was washed by ultrasonication in a mixed solution of acetone and ethanol (1:1 vol). Rectangular-shaped electrodes (1.5 × 2.0 cm2, thickness ∼64 μm) were used. The metal mesh was used as the anode and the counter electrode was a Pt plate. The co-electro-deposition process was performed in an aqueous solution containing 80 mL (0.1 M) of manganese(II) acetate and 0.4 mL PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution (1 wt%) with a 10.0 V DC voltage. Since the content of both Mn2+ and PEDOT:PSS are in great excess as compared with the deposited composite mass, it can be regarded that the concentration of the solution is constant. The control sample of the pure MnO2 deposited electrode was prepared in a 0.1 M manganese acetate aqueous solution (80 mL). The obtained electrodes were rinsed with deionized water several times to remove the impurities and dried at 60 °C for 1 h.2.2 The fabrication of the asymmetric aqueous supercapacitorThe activated carbon electrode was prepared by mixing 80% activated carbon, 10% acetylene black and 10% PVDF. The mixture was casted onto PET orAl foil as the negative electrode. This electrode was pressed and combined with the MnO2–PEDOT:PSS electrode with 0.5 M Na2SO4 as the electrolyte and a separator (NKK TF44 25 μm) in between. The mass loading of MnO2–PEDOT:PSS and activated carbon are 0.94 mg cm−2 and 0.99 mg cm−2, respectively. The supercapacitor was packaged by PET films and EVA hot melt glue.2.3 Materials characterization and electrochemical measurementsThe morphology and microstructure of the composites were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, HITACH S4800, Japan) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL-2100F). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements (ESCALAB 250Xi) were performed to analyze the surface species and their chemical states. Deconvolution and spectral line fitting were carried out using XPS Peak 4.0. Raman spectra were recorded on a Jobin-Yvon Horbia 800 using a 632.8 nm laser. The Zeta potential of PEDOT:PSS was determined with a zetasizer (Malvern Zetasize Nano ZS, Malvern Instruments).The electrochemical properties of the as-prepared samples were investigated on an electrochemical station (VMP3, Bio-Logic, France) by a typical three-electrode configuration in a Na2SO4 (0.5 M) aqueous electrolyte. The working electrodes were the as-prepared samples with an electrode area of 3 cm2, and platinum and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The applied potential window of cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge was in the range from 0.0 V to 1.0 V. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted in the frequency range between 100 KHz and 0.01 Hz. The specific capacitance was calculated from the CVs and discharge curves according to the equations: (1) (2)where, C is the specific capacitance of materials, m is the mass loading on the substrate, v is the scan rate, ΔV is the potential window in the CV curves, i(V) is the voltammetric current, I is the applied current density, ΔU is potential window in discharging process and Δt is the discharging time.23 The energy and power density (E and P) were calculated by the equation: E = ∫IV(t)dt/(Vol)(3) P = E/Δt(4)where I is the discharging current, V(t) is the discharging current excluding the IR drop, dt is the time differential, Δt is the discharging time and Vol refers to the volume of the device, respectively. It is worth mentioning that the volumetric capacitance includes the active material, the substrate (or the current collector) and the separator with electrolyte.3 Results and discussionIn our design, EPD is selected to deposit PEDOT:PSS, while MnO2 is deposited through anode deposition. EPD has attracted increasing attention both in academia and industrial sectors not only because of its highly versatile applications but also because of the cost-effectiveness and the requirement of simple apparatus.34 Other advantages of EPD include strong adherence, high density and excellent homogeneity of the coating.6 In the stock solution containing both PEDOT:PSS and Mn2+, PEDOT:PSS (Zeta potential is −24.65 mV at pH = 3.45) was driven by the electrostatic field and was tightly attached to the in situ formed MnO2 at the anode surface, forming a nanostructured composite film. The resulting composite showed a high specific capacitance (503 F g−1 at 1 mV s−1 in 0.5 M Na2SO4) and excellent electrochemical cyclability (99.5% specific capacitance retention after 4000 cycles). Using this method, thick electrode films can be conveniently obtained, since the presence of PEDOT:PSS facilitates the charge transfer process for Mn2+ at the electrode surface. By elongating the time of the electric field applied, a high mass loading of the MnO2–PEDOT:PSS (8.4 mg cm−2) composite is conveniently prepared, which exhibits an excellent areal capacitance (1.67 F cm−2 at 0.5 mA cm−2). To further demonstrate the potential of the hybrid electrode for ultrathin and light-weight applications, we fabricated a 1.5 × 4 cm2 2.0 V asymmetric supercapacitor assembled with the MnO2–PEDOT:PSS positive electrode and activated carbon film negative electrode. This supercapacitor device shows a maximum volume energy density and power density of ∼1.80 × 10−3 W h cm−3 and ∼0.38 W cm−3 respectively. Furthermore, it shows an excellent rate capability with a good rectangular CV curve even at the scan rate of 2.0 V s−1.Fig. 1 a briefly illustrates the electrode and supercapacitor fabrication process. The MnO2–PEDOT:PSS nanocomposite was conformally deposited on the surface of the stainless steel substrate using co-electro-deposition. This electrode is used as the positive electrode and the activated carbon (AC) film is used as the negative electrode. Thus the supercapacitor is an asymmetric one. The as-prepared supercapacitor device is ultrathin, flexible and light-weight. Fig. 1  (a) A schematic of the fabrication process: the MnO2–PEDOT:PSS nanocomposite is co-electro-deposited onto the stainless steel mesh (anode) and then it is fabricated in the asymmetrical supercapacitor as the positive electrode and the activated carbon is used as the negative electrode. (b) SEM images of the MnO2–PEDOT:PSS nanocomposite at low and high magnifications. The one-step co-electro-deposition method we used involves two techniques: anode deposition and EPD. The electrochemical preparation of manganese oxide from an aqueous solution of Mn2+ has been widely reported. The electrochemical reaction of the manganese oxide formation can be described as follows: Mn2+ + 2H2O → MnO2 + 4H+ + 2e−(5)On the other hand, EPD was carried out for the PEDOT:PSS deposition. In our experiment, the Zeta potential of the PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution was recorded to be −24.65 mV at pH = 3.45. The attachment of PEDOT:PSS onto the electrodes can be simply attributed to the Coulomb force driven by the electric field.Fig. 1b shows the photographic image of the stainless steel mesh after the MnO2–PEDOT:PSS deposition. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the surface becomes darker as the deposition time increases, which indicates that MnO2–PEDOT:PSS is effectively deposited on the surface. The MnO2 and MnO2–PEDOT:PSS mass contents increase with the deposition time almost linearly and the deposited mass of MnO2–PEDOT:PSS is about twice of that of MnO2 under the same deposition time and electric field, which is due to the improved electrical conductivity due to the presence of PEDOT:PSS. In this method, we can easily obtain high mass loadings of the active materials as high as 8.4 mg cm−2 within 20 minutes on the stainless steel substrate with the applied voltage of 10.0 V. As compared to some recently reported techniques for fabricating the composite electrode materials, this is much effective, e.g., it is 20 times faster than Hu's report in preparing a MnO2–conducting material composite electrode and 60 times faster than Sumboja's report in preparing a MnO2–graphene sheet composite electrode.28,35 It reveals that this is a highly efficient method to prepare supercapacitor electrodes as compared to the other available deposition methods.36,37 Fig. 2  Upper: a plot showing the mass loading vs. deposition time of MnO2–PEDOT:PSS and control MnO2. Lower: the corresponding MnO2–PEDOT:PSS nanocomposite deposited on the stainless steel substrate with different mass loadings (the mass increases from left to right). In order to evaluate the adhesion strength and cohesiveness of the MnO2–PEDOT:PSS nanocomposite active mass on the stainless steel current collector, we attached a piece of scotch tape to the dried MnO2 and MnO2–PEDOT:PSS film with a full contact.6 Then it was peeled off by hand and the surfaces on both sides were carefully observed to evaluate the adhesion properties of the active mass towards the current collector. The experimental result suggests that the MnO2–PEDOT:PSS composite film is robust enough to resist the peeling force, while the control sample (the film with the control pure MnO2) was easily peeled off by the tape. As Fig. S2† shows, when the scotch tape was removed, some black powders from the pure MnO2 film were transferred to the tape, and the underlying metal parts of the stainless steel current collector became exposed. The MnO2–PEDOT:PSS film, however, exhibited un-noticeable detachment from the mesh, even by peeling for several times, when the film was warped by repeatedly peeling. The reason for this adhesion enhancement is that the interaction between MnO2 and the substrate is dominated by van der Waals forces. However the mechanical property of MnO2 is poor and the van der Waals forces to the substrate is weak. Compared with pure MnO2, MnO2 and PEDOT:PSS are uniformly combined with each other during the co-electro-deposition process, and thus PEDOT:PSS acts as the polymer binder which significantly enhances the integrity of the composite. Additionally, PEDOT:PSS to some extent has a better contact with the metal mesh substrate and gives a mechanical interlocking effect in addition to the van der Waals forces. This experiment as shown in Fig. S2† indicates that PEDOT:PSS is able to function as an excellent binder for the MnO2 electrode.Fig. 3a and c show scanning electron microscopy (SEM) over-view images of the MnO2 and MnO2–PEDOT:PSS samples, respectively. The MnO2 without PEDOT:PSS appears to have a smooth surface on the stainless steel mesh. However, the top layer of MnO2–PEDOT:PSS appears to be uniform assemblies of nanospheres with rough surface textures (Fig. S3a†). The diameter of the nanospheres ranges from 100 nm to 500 nm. This morphology is analogous to the prior reports regarding the MnO2 nanostructures obtained from the redox preparation method.36 Fig. 3  (a) SEM and (b) TEM images of the anode-deposited pure MnO2 electrode material. (c) SEM and (d) TEM images of the co-electro-deposited MnO2–PEDOT:PSS electrode material. The inset in (d) is the selected area electron diffraction pattern of the same sample. From the SEM images and the corresponding EDAX (Fig. S4†) analysis, we find that PEDOT:PSS was entangled with MnO2 and there is no distinct boundary between MnO2 and PEDOT:PSS. The MnO2 and MnO2–PEDOT:PSS samples were scratched from the meshes for the TEM tests. Fig. 3b shows that the control MnO2 sample obtained through the anode deposition process is only composed of scattered powders, indicating the low cohesiveness of the material. As compared, the MnO2–PEDOT:PSS nanocomposite still keeps the assembly of spherical nanoparticles which suggests that the addition of PEDOT:PSS improves the cohesiveness between MnO2, and both PEDOT:PSS and MnO2 combine well with each other. This is further confirmed by the high resolution TEM analysis, as shown in Fig. S3b,† which gives a clearer view of the nanocomposite. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) from the same area is shown in the inset of Fig. 3d, showing that the deposited MnO2 are crystalline.The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of the MnO2–PEDOT:PSS electrodes were used to determine the oxidation state of the as-prepared MnO2. The XPS full spectrum (Fig. S5a†) containing signals from Mn, O, S and C elements indicates the presence of both MnO2 and PEDOT:PSS. Mn 2p spectra (Fig. 4a) show that the Mn 2p3/2 and Mn 2p1/2 of both the pure MnO2 and the MnO2–PEDOT:PSS electrode materials have binding energies centering at 642.2 eV and 654.1 eV respectively, with an energy separation of 11.9 eV, which is in good agreement with the reported data for MnO2.38,39 It also indicates that the introduction of PEDOT:PSS did not change the oxidation state of MnO2. The separation of peak energies (ΔEb) between the two peaks of the Mn 3s components can be used as an indicator of the Mn oxidation state in manganese oxides. Fig. S5b† shows that ΔEb is 4.98 eV between 4.8 and 5.3 eV, which is the peak separation of Mn4+ and Mn3+, respectively.23,39 This suggests an intermediate oxidation state between Mn4+ and Mn3+. A reported method is used to calculate the average valence of Mn by the analysis of the O 1s spectra (Fig. 4b).39 The average Mn valence in MnO2 is estimated to be 3.64 eV, which coincides with the analysis of the Mn 3s spectrum. The XPS spectra of sulfur 2p for the MnO2–PEDOT:PSS composite are shown in Fig. 4c. The peaks at 164.2 eV and 165.3 eV correspond to the sulfur atom of PEDOT. The higher binding energy peak at 168.5 eV corresponds to the sulfur atom from PSS.40,41 An XPS depth-profile is performed to determine the variation of the concentrations of the Mn and S elements in the MnO2–PEDOT:PSS film. Fig. 4d shows that with the increase of sputter time (0–1100 seconds), the signal intensity of Mn 2p and S 2p are almost constant, which confirms that the co-electro-deposition process can result in a uniform combination of MnO2 and PEDOT:PSS at the nanoscale. Fig. 4  The (a) Mn 2p, (b) O 1s, (c) S 2p core level XPS spectra of the MnO2–PEDOT:PSS nanocomposite. (d) The XPS depth-profile of the same sample. It shows that the ratio between the Mn and S elements is constant with the sputtering time. The electrochemical performance of the samples of MnO2 and MnO2–PEDOT:PSS was measured. Fig. 5a shows the CV curves of the stainless steel substrate, MnO2 and MnO2–PEDOT:PSS at the scan rate of 20 mV s−1. The line-like CV curve of the stainless steel substrate suggests that the substrate hardly contributes to the capacitance of the electrode. The CV curve of the MnO2–PEDOT:PSS shows a better rectangular shape and a larger area than MnO2. It indicates that MnO2–PEDOT:PSS has a better capacitive behavior. Fig. 5c shows the CV curves of MnO2–PEDOT:PSS at different scan rates ranging from 1 to 100 mV s−1. The dependence of the MnO2–PEDOT:PSS specific capacitance versus scan rate is plotted in Fig. 5b, suggesting a larger specific capacitance than the pure MnO2 (the specific capacitance is calculated by eqn (1)). The capacitance is lower at high scan rates because the electrolyte ions have difficulties in fully accessing the interior surfaces of the active materials due to the reduced diffusion time.23 Fig. 5  (a) The CV curves of the stainless steel mesh substrate, MnO2 and MnO2–PEDOT:PSS at 20 mV s−1. (b) A comparison of the specific capacitance between MnO2 and MnO2–PEDOT:PSS versus scan rate. (c) the CV curves of the MnO2–PEDOT:PSS electrodes at different scan rates. (d) Specific capacitance vs. scan rate of the MnO2–PEDOT:PSS electrodes with different mass loading. (e) Areal capacitance vs. scan rate for electrodes with different mass loadings. (f) A comparison of the cycling properties for the MnO2 and MnO2–PEDOT:PSS electrodes up to 4000 cycles at 50 mV s−1. As far as we know, a thinner active material layer and a slower scan rate lead to a better specific capacitance performance of a supercapacitor, which is related to the transport efficiency of both the electrons and ions during the electrochemical process. Yet in practical applications, a high loading density of the active mass and high scan rate properties are both necessary. Moreover, from the device aspect, the power performance of the supercapacitor depends on the total mass of the supercapacitor, including the electrolyte, electrodes, separator and current collectors, etc.37 Therefore, we investigated the relationship between the mass loading and scan rate, so as to optimize the proper mass loading of the active materials for different devices by this method. Fig. S6† shows the CV scans of MnO2–PEDOT:PSS with different mass loading at 20 mV s−1. The CV shapes remain nearly rectangular at low mass loadings; however, when the mass loading increases the CV shapes show more deviations. The specific capacitances with respect to the mass of MnO2–PEDOT:PSS are plotted in Fig. 5d. A specific capacitance of 503 F g−1 can be achieved at 1 mV s−1. The specific capacitance decreases with the mass loading and increases with the scan rate. The specific capacitance decreases dramatically with the increase of the scan rate at low scan rates, and remain nearly constant when the scan rate is higher than 20 mV s−1. It has been revealed that as the mass loading increases, the specific capacitance decreases due to the kinetics of the ion transport in the electrodes with low ion diffusion constants.37Fig. 5e demonstrates the areal capacitance versus different MnO2–PEDOT:PSS electrode mass loadings. A high areal capacitance has been achieved up to 1670 mF cm−2 at the current density of 0.5 mA cm−2, which is advantageous over the previously reported results on areal capacitance.25,28,35 When the mass loading increases, the areal capacitance increases accordingly. Therefore, by increasing the mass loading, a higher areal capacitance can be obtained easily by this method.The cycle life is an important parameter for the supercapacitor. In the cycle life experiment over 4000 cycles for the MnO2 and MnO2–PEDOT:PSS composite were carried out at 50 mV s−1. Unlike many other reported metal oxide–conductive polymer composites which have a poor cycle life, Fig. 5f demonstrates the excellent cycling performance of this composite. We found that the capacitance retention was 99.5% after 4000 cycles compared with the 85.5% retention of capacitance after 4000 cycles of the control pure MnO2 electrode. The excellent cycling performance of MnO2–PEDOT:PSS electrode is also evidenced by the almost overlapped CV curves of the first and the 4000th cycle, as shown in Fig. S7.† The results suggest that the small amount of PEDOT:PSS (9.9% by weight in the composite which is calculated by the data from Table S1†) acts as an excellent binder for the nanocomposite.To demonstrate the viability of forming a device, an aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor was fabricated instead of a symmetric supercapacitor. The asymmetric supercapacitor has a higher working voltage compared with the symmetric one which has a voltage of about 1.0 V. Furthermore it is more suitable for real portable electronics such as driving LED and mini-speakers as a higher voltage e.g. 3 V is a must. The asymmetric supercapacitor was fabricated using MnO2–PEDOT:PSS as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode, respectively. In order to evaluate the electrochemical properties and estimate the stable potential windows of the MnO2–PEDOT:PSS composite and activated carbon, CV measurements were performed on the two electrode materials in the 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte before the test of a full cell. A three-electrode system with a platinum foil as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode was used. The MnO2–PEDOT:PSS was measured within a potential window of 0–1.0 V, while activated carbon was measured within a potential window of −1.0–0.2 V at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1, as shown in Fig. 6a. The CV curves indicate that the voltage of the asymmetric supercapacitor can be as high as 2.0 V. To further demonstrate the large voltage window of the supercapacitor, CV measurements were carried out with different voltage windows at 20 mV s−1 (Fig. 6b). The aqueous supercapacitor demonstrates an ideal capacitive behavior with rectangular CV curves, even at the potential window as large as 2.0 V. Fig. 6  (a) The comparative CV curves of the MnO2–PEDOT:PSS and activated carbon electrodes performed in a three-electrode cell in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution at the scan rate of 20 mV s−1. (b) The CV curves of an optimized (MnO2–PEDOT:PSS)/AC supercapacitor measured at different potential windows in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. (c) The CV curves of the (MnO2–PEDOT:PSS)/AC supercapacitor at the scan rates of 10, 20, 50 and 100 mV s−1. (d) The Nyquist plots of the EIS for the aqueous supercapacitor. (e) The galvanostatic charge–discharge curves obtained at a current density of 50 mA cm−3. (f) The discharging curves of the (MnO2–PEDOT:PSS)/AC asymmetric supercapacitor at different current densities from 5 to 500 mA cm−3. To evaluate the electrochemical properties of the asymmetric supercapacitor, we carried out the CV measurements at different scan rates ranging from 10 to 100 mV s−1. The device shows an excellent rectangular CV geometry, indicating a better capacitive behavior. Surprisingly, the CV curve still remains a good rectangular shape even when a high scan rate (2.0 V s−1) is applied (Fig. S8†). This demonstrates the good rate capability of the full cell. For further understanding, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the MnO2/AC and (MnO2–PEDOT:PSS)/AC asymmetric supercapacitors was measured in the frequency range of 100 kHz–10 MHz at an open circuit potential with an ac perturbation of 5 mV (Fig. 6d). The measured impedance spectra were analyzed using the complex nonlinear least-squares (CNLS) fitting method.42 The electrical equivalent circuit was given in Fig. S9.† At high frequencies, the intercept at real part represents the combined resistance of the ionic resistance of the electrolyte, the intrinsic resistance of the substrate and the contact resistance at the active material–current collector interface (Re),43 and Rct refers to the charge-transfer resistance caused by the Faradic reactions and the double-layer capacitance on the grain surface.44 According to the impedance spectra, the Re/Rct of the (MnO2–PEDOT:PSS)/AC supercapacitor is 0.48 Ω/9.50 Ω compared with 0.65 Ω/11.76 Ω of the control MnO2/AC supercapacitor. The Re value is almost the same for both supercapacitors. However, the Rct of the (MnO2–PEDOT:PS)/AC supercapacitor is lower than that of the MnO2/AC supercapacitor as a result of the conductivity enhancement of the MnO2–PEDOT:PSS composite. The good capacitive behavior and low internal resistance were further confirmed by the galvanostatic charge–discharge experiment of the (MnO2–PEDOT:PSS)/AC supercapacitor device. Fig. 6e shows the nearly triangular shape of the charge–discharge curves at current density of 50 mA cm−3, indicating the fast ion transport within the electrodes.45 Furthermore, these charge–discharge curves show only a small voltage drop of 0.029 V at the start of the discharge curve, indicating a device with a low internal resistance. The discharge curves of the supercapacitor devices at various current densities are shown in Fig. 6f and S10.†Fig. 7a shows a Ragone plot of the fully assembled supercapacitor devices reported in this manuscript and some other recently reported ones for comparison. By considering the fact that these devices are specially designed for thin film energy storage purposes, volumetric energy and power densities were used as the figure of merit; which were calculated based on the stack of the whole tested devices. The performance of the (MnO2–PEDOT:PSS)/AC asymmetric supercapacitor was compared with MnO2/AC supercapacitors, laser-scribed graphene-based (LSG) supercapacitors,45 3 V/30 μF aluminum electrolytic capacitors and a 500 μA h lithium thin-film battery.45 It appears that our (MnO2–PEDOT:PSS)/AC asymmetric supercapacitor device exhibits excellent energy and power densities. The energy density of the (MnO2–PEDOT:PS)/AC supercapacitor (as high as 1.80 × 10−3 W h cm−3) is higher than that of the MnO2/AC supercapacitor, which is twenty-five times higher than that of the aqueous LSG supercapacitor. Furthermore, the energy is three orders of magnitude higher than that of the aluminum electrolytic capacitor. Even at a high power density of 0.38 W cm−3, a value that is about seventy times higher than that of the Li thin-film battery, the device still shows an energy density of 3.62 × 10−4 W h cm−3, approaching the lower end of Li thin-film battery. Fig. 7  (a) A Ragone plot showing the energy and power densities of the (MnO2–PEDOT:PSS)/AC supercapacitors compared with the MnO2/AC supercapacitors, LSG supercapacitors, aluminum electrolytic capacitors and a lithium thin-film battery.45 The (MnO2–PEDOT:PSS)/AC supercapacitors demonstrate high power and energy densities. (b) Photographs showing a piece of prototyped smart card with two pieces of inlay asymmetric supercapacitors in series. A piece of LED indicator (1.8 V, 20 mA), a thin film switch, and a piece of flexible circuit board are assembled in the card, and the indicator is driven by the supercapacitors assembled inside. Due to the high flexibility of as-fabricated supercapacitors the smart card can be flexible. (c) The charge and discharge curves of the supercapacitor series in the prototyped smart card. After charging for 5 s the potential can be as high as 2.6 V. The power source can drive the red LED (1.8 V, 20 mA) very bright for 40 minutes and the LED remains effective after 2 hours. The inset in (c) shows the detail of the charge curve. As shown in Fig. S11a and b,† the as-prepared supercapacitor exhibits an excellent flexibility and it can even endure repeated twisting without any harm to its structural integrity. There is no apparent change on the CV curves under different bending angles ranging from 0 to 120° (Fig. S11c†). This further confirms the excellent flexibility of the as-prepared supercapacitor. To demonstrate the real application, the asymmetric supercapacitor was used to drive a red LED indicator (1.8 V, 20 mA) (Fig. S12†), and the size of the asymmetric supercapacitor was compared with a coin (US quarter dollar) and a piece of credit card, as shown in Fig. S13.† To further evaluate the supercapacitor properties with the date reported, two supercapacitors were prepared in series and charged to 3.0 V to drive a red LED indicator. The LED indicator remained effective enough for indication for more than 2.5 hours, which is longer than the recently reported result by Zhou et al.46 Moreover, the charge speed of such a single device to 2.0 V can be as fast as 13 s. As shown in Fig. S14,† the self-discharge curve of the supercapacitor device obtained immediately after charging to 1.3 V is recorded. It appears that it takes 6.5 h to discharge from 1.3 V (Vmax) to 0.65 V (1/2Vmax) which indicates much lower self-discharge properties than some reported carbon based supercapacitors.13,47 Owning to the superior performance of our ultrathin supercapacitor, a prototype smart card with two inlay supercapacitors (connected in series) was prepared as shown in Fig. 7b. A piece of LED chip (1.8 V, 20 mA) and a thin film switch were bonded on a piece of flexible circuit board and connected to the supercapacitors as well. By pressing the switch, the LED would light up, powered by the two supercapacitor in series (Fig. 7b and ESI Movie 1†). Owning to the flexibility of the supercapacitors, the smart card can be flexible and the bending angle is more than 60°. As Fig. 7c shows after charging for 5 seconds, the voltage of the power source in the smart card can reach as high as 2.6 V. The supercapacitor series can drive the red LED very bright for 40 minutes. The LED remained effective enough for indication after 2 hours. As shown in Fig. S15a,† the smart card is as thin as 0.744 mm, which is even thinner than a commercial credit card (0.8 mm). The function of the smart card with an inlay supercapacitor can be further supplemented by integrating other active components and modules such as organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), sensors, actuators, speakers, and even wireless systems etc. Our ultrathin and rapid charging supercapacitor can be an excellent power driver for portable and miniaturized devices such a smart cards. Meanwhile, by adjusting the fabrication parameters e.g. the MnO2–PEDOT:PSS mass loading, it is convenient to adjust the capacitance and other properties, and thus we do believe this is a promising method to produce high performance supercapacitor devices for various applications.4 ConclusionsTo sum up, we report a simple and highly efficient technology to fabricate a uniform MnO2–PEDOT:PSS nanocomposite electrode in a one-step deposition process combined with both anode deposition and EPD. With this combination, we obtained a remarkably high performance nanocomposite electrode with the thickness up to 8.4 mg cm−2 within 20 minutes even on a ubiquitous substrate material i.e. stainless steel mesh. The as-obtained nanocomposite electrode contains over 90 wt% of MnO2, which guarantees excellent capacitive properties: the areal capacitance can reach as high as 1670 mF cm−2 at 0.5 mA cm−2, which is advantageous over the previously reported results on the areal capacitance of a single electrode for use in supercapacitors. Typically, this nanocomposite shows a maximum specific capacitance of 503 F g−1 at 1 mV s−1, and shows 99.5% retention of the specific capacitance after 4000 cycles at 50 mV s−1. An asymmetric aqueous supercapacitor based on such a MnO2–PEDOT:PSS electrode shows a high energy density (1.80 × 10−3 W h cm−3), a high power energy density (0.38 W cm−3) and an excellent rate capability, which is advantageous over many reported data regarding both the energy density and power density. The flexible, robust, ultrathin and high performance supercapacitor is a good candidate for the smart card inlay power source to realize much novel functionality. We believe that this technology holds a promise for high-performance supercapacitor preparations and may find wide applications in light-weight and ultrathin electronics. In addition, we envisage that when choosing high specific area substrate materials e.g. carbon nanofiber films, the areal capacitance of the electrode materials can be further boosted.AcknowledgementsThis research is partially funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51202120, 51232005), Shenzhen Government (JCYJ20120616215238779) and Guangdong Province Innovation R&D Team Plan (2009010025).
