    , Accepted 6th September 2016First published on 14th September 2016AbstractHomogeneous, small gold nanoparticles (d = 1.87 nm) have been prepared by photochemical reduction of HAuCl4 in the presence of Irgacure® 2959 under high power UV irradiation at 365 nm produced by a LED source. These particles have been deposited on PTFE microbeads (d = 200 μm) and evaluated for the catalysis of the oxidative esterification of aldehydes in the presence of H2O2. Under green light (λ ≈ 530 nm) and repeated addition of H2O2, the catalytic system is accelerated and achieves complete conversions in minutes. Furthermore the catalyst can be recycled ten times consecutively without any activity loss by adding a step for AuNP recycling. The mechanism of the reaction follows a zero rate order, and Hammett free energy relationships for substituted benzaldehydes afforded a positive ρ value (ρ = 2.35) demonstrating that the initial hemiacetalisation equilibrium (ρ = 2.31) is the rate determining step. Kinetics data are in agreement with an Eley–Rideal type mechanism and permits proposing a reaction mechanism.
Introduction
Esterification reaction is traditionally a two-step procedure including, first, the preparation of an activated carboxylic acid derivative such as acid anhydride, acid chloride or N-hydroxyester under stoichiometric conditions, and then its reaction with an alcohol to produce the corresponding ester.1,2 These protocols usually generate a large amount of waste. Recently, direct oxidative esterification reactions of alcohols or aldehydes catalyzed by reusable heterogeneous catalysts under mild conditions appeared as attractive alternatives for both organic synthesis and green chemistry.3
Since the pioneering discovery by Haruta and coworkers who demonstrated that gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) catalyze the oxidation of CO effectively at low temperatures,4 the scope of gold catalyzed oxidation reactions has expanded tremendously.5–7 In particular, the oxidation of alcohols to the corresponding acids has received significant attention.8 Under similar conditions, oxidation of aldehydes to esters proceeds under mild conditions.9–13 For this purpose, molecular oxygen or hydrogen peroxide14 in catalyzed oxidation reactions proved to be particularly effective as a co-oxidant for AuNP catalytic systems. These new catalytic systems satisfy most of the demands for a modern, sustainable and ‘‘green’’ oxidation reaction.
AuNPs exhibit a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption band around 520 nm.15 Excitation of the surface plasmon band was described recently as a strategy of choice in order to facilitate electronic transfers that occur along redox reactions.16,17 This photocatalytic activity of AuNPs has attracted increasing attention in recent years because it can be driven with sunlight at ambient temperatures.18 The mechanism of AuNP photocatalytic activity has been examined by Zhu et al. who gave a mechanism different from that for conventional semiconductor photocatalysts.19
In continuation of our research program concerning the synthesis of gold nanoparticles within microreactors20 and their immobilization into fused silica capillary tubings for the development of catalytic microreactors,21 we recently observed that, subjected to colloidal AuNP solution, Teflon® coated magnetic stirrer bars developed a purple-brown color on the surface characteristic of gold nanoparticle deposition. We turned this observation into a reproducible protocol and we describe here the preparation and characterization of PTFE supported gold catalysts. In order to evaluate their catalytic efficiency, the photocatalyzed oxidative esterification of various substituted benzaldehydes in the presence of methanol under mild conditions has been evaluated. Traditional methods for the preparation of supported catalysts include co-precipitation, deposition–precipitation, ion-exchange, impregnation, and successive reduction and calcinations.22 However, these methodologies have some disadvantages, such as lack of control over size, morphology, especially for catalysts such as AuNPs, with limited stability. Therefore, the immobilization of pre-synthesized AuNPs has gained attention; since it can lead to controllable size, shape and surface properties of nanoparticles.23 By choosing the preparation method of the nanoparticles, such properties can be tuned as well as their catalytic activities. In the present study, pre-synthesized uncoordinated, small and homogeneous AuNPs (average diameter 1.87 nm), obtained by photochemical reduction of HAuCl4 in the presence of Irgacure® 2959, were used as precursors for the preparation of a PTFE supported gold catalyst. These Teflon® supported particles were found to be excellent recyclable photocatalysts for the oxidation of substituted benzaldehydes to their corresponding methyl esters.
Experimental
Materials
All chemicals were used as received without any purification. Hydrogen tetrachloroaurate(III) hydrate 99.9%, Au 49% (HAuCl4) was purchased from Strem Chemicals (Bischheim, France). All other chemical compounds were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Lyon, France). All solutions were prepared from deionized water produced by a Milli-Q® system from Millipore (Molsheim, France).
AuNP photochemical synthesis
The preparation of gold nanoparticles was performed according to the original procedure reported by Scaiano et al.24–26 Every reaction has been performed in an optical transparent plastic or quartz cuvette (12.5 × 12.5 × 45 mm). The irradiation source Lightning Cure LC-L1 equipped with a L9613-200 lens (illumination diameter = 10 mm) from Hamamatsu (Massy, France) was placed on the top of the cuvette and used at a specified intensity (λ = 365 nm). The irradiance was measured in mW cm−1 using a Hamamatsu UV power meter (C6080) positioned at 1 cm from the source and was in accord with the power indicated by the source.

Typical procedure. 
All the experiments were performed at atmospheric pressure without exclusion of air by an inert gas. In a typical preparation, 2 mL of HAuCl4 solution (6.6 × 10−4 M) are poured in a cuvette. Then, 2 mL of 4-(2-hydroxyethoxy)phenyl-(2-hydroxyl-2-propyl)ketone (Irgacure® 2959) solution (2 × 10−3 M) were added to the cuvette. The obtained pale yellow solution was left under slow mechanical stirring for 2 minutes. When the solution is irradiated a red-ruby colloid solution developed with time. After complete reaction (15 minutes) the gold colloid solution is collected in an Erlenmeyer flask surrounded with aluminum foil and conserved at cold temperature (4 °C). The experiment is repeated 10 times to obtain a volume of about 40 mL for later immobilization on PTFE microbeads. The study of AuNP average diameter vs irradiance of the UV light source has been performed for every sample according to this procedure by varying the light power in %.


AuNP colloid solution characterization. 
The UV-vis spectra of the AuNP colloids were measured using a Cary UV 100 spectrophotometer from Varian (Massy, France). Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) analysis was performed on a DynaPro NanoStar instrument Wyatt (Toulouse, France) at a thermostated temperature of 25 °C using a fixed scattering angle of 173°.
TEM analysis has been performed on these samples using a FEI Tecnai G2 20 (Hillsboro, OR, USA) equipped with a LaB6 filament at 200 kV. The specimens for examination by electron microscopy were prepared by adding one or two drops of a colloid solution of the nanoparticles onto holey carbon films supported on standard copper grids. In order to avoid any agglomeration process along deposition, a silicon dioxide grid (20 nm film, from SIMpore Inc., West Henrietta, NY, USA) functionalized on the surface with 25 μL of mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane (Sigma, Saint Quantin-Fallavier, France) for 2 hours has been evaluated in place of standard copper grids.

AuNP immobilization on PTFE microbeads

Typical procedure. 
Fifty mg of PTFE powder (particle diameter: 200 μm) was placed in a 50 mL glass Erlenmeyer. Then, 5 mL of acetone were poured into the Erlenmeyer flask. The Erlenmeyer flask was closed and mechanically shaken using a CAT S50 (Staufen, Germany) wrist arm shaker until no PTFE agglomerates remained. Then 5 mL of AuNP colloids were added to the PTFE suspension. The suspension was shaken overnight. The purple-grey PTFE powder was then filtered under vacuum on a frit, washed 5 times with 5 mL of dry acetone and allowed to dry over 15 minutes. This experiment has also been performed on larger quantities (50 mL) using similar ratios.


AuNP/PTFE characterization. 
The AuNP/PTFE has been characterized by MEB, XPS and EPR. XPS analyses were performed on a VG ESCALAB 220XL instrument (Villebon-sur-Yvette, France). SEM images were obtained using a JEOL JSM-7800F LV (FEG, low vacuum) instrument (Tokyo, Japan). TEM images were recorded using a FEI Tecnai G2 20 instrument (Hillsboro, OR, USA) operating at 200 keV. EPR spectra were recorded using a Bruker (Wissembourg, France) Elexys E580 spectrometer operating at the X-band modulation amplitude and microwave power set, respectively, at 5 Gauss and 1 mW. Spectra were recorded at 5 K using a Bruker Cryofree system.

Oxidative esterification of benzaldehydes

Typical procedure under room light illumination conditions. 
In a typical procedure, 1.3 mmol of base (2 eq.) were dissolved in 10 mL of dry methanol and poured into a 20 mL flask. The mixture is stirred until complete dissolution of the base. Then, 0.64 mmol of benzaldehyde are added (1 eq. 65 μL) and the reaction mixture is stirred for additional 30 minutes. Finally, 1 mmol (1.5 eq., 50 μL) of hydrogen peroxide (50 w/w% in water) and AuNP/PTFE catalyst (200 mg, 1 mol%) are added to the mixture which define the starting time of the reaction. The reaction medium is strongly stirred during the reaction to disperse the solid catalyst into the solution. Every 20 minutes, 1 mmol (1.5 eq., 50 μL) of hydrogen peroxide (50 w/w% in water) is added. At the end of the reaction, the catalyst is filtered off on a frit, the solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure and the crude mixture is analyzed by 1H NMR.


Kinetic monitoring. 
For kinetic monitoring 50 μL of the reaction medium are sampled at different times and introduced into a vial containing 2 μL of formic acid and 1 mL of CH2Cl2 to quench the reaction. The sample is then injected without further treatment into a GC-MS apparatus: PolarisQ Thermo Electron (electron ionization, EI 70 eV, column: Rxi®-5 ms, length: 60 m; internal diameter: 0.25 mm; film thickness 0.5 μm). The conditions for the GC method are the following: split 1/50, temperature gradient from 50 °C to 275 °C at 5 °C min−1. Every kinetic measurement has been repeated 2 or 3 times and the given values are averaged.


Photocatalytic procedures. 
For photocatalytic reactions with t-BuOK as the base, a green fluorescent tube lamp (LEXMAN, EQSS-3, 15 W, 120 mA, E27) is placed in close contact with the Pyrex® flask before introducing the catalyst. The irradiation is maintained during all the reaction times and 1 mmol (1.5 eq., 50 μL) of hydrogen peroxide (50 w/w% in water) is added every 8 minutes. For Hammett relationship experiments, the same procedure has been used with various p-substituted benzaldehydes (0.64 mmol). The same previous workup and kinetic monitoring procedure have been used. Every kinetic measurement has been repeated 2 or 3 times and the given values are averaged. For reaction under solar illumination conditions, the same procedure has been applied by placing the flask under magnetic stirring outside of the building (outside temperature: 31 °C). The same previous workup and kinetic monitoring procedure have been used.

Hemiacetalisation equilibrium constant measurements

Typical procedure. 
In a 15 mL flask, 0.1 mmol of t-BuOK (2 eq., 11 mg) and 0.05 mmol (1 eq.) of the para-substituted benzaldehyde are dissolved in CD3OD (0.75 mL) and the mixture is stirred for 2 hours at room temperature. The mixture is transferred to a NMR tube and analyzed by 1H NMR using a Bruker (Wissembourg, France) Advance 300 Ultrashield spectrometer at room temperature with calibration on the solvent peak. The equilibrium constant is determined by comparison of aromatic peaks, hemiacetalic and aldehydic peaks (averaged integration).

Catalyst recycling procedure

Typical procedure. 
In a 25 mL flask, the previously used AuNP/PTFE catalyst (250 mg) is introduced and consequently 5 mL of acetone and 5 mL of deionized water are added. Then 300 μL of H2O2 (50 w/w% in water) are added and the mixture is stirred for two hours at room temperature. The catalyst is filtered on a frit, washed with methanol and dried before to be reused in the following catalytic run. The recycled AuNP/PTFE catalyst has then been analysed by XPS and the evolution of morphology is performed step by step under a stereomicroscope (Nikon, SMZ 1000).

Results and discussion
Gold nanoparticle photochemical synthesis
The HAuCl4/I-2959® samples were typically irradiated in a UV-Vis cuvette without air exclusion using a new generation of high power UV LED system (Hamamatsu LC-L1, Fig. 1) delivering a focalized irradiation of 350 mW cm−2, at 365 nm. The reaction was monitored by UV-Vis spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering (DLS) to determine the AuNP size. The UV-Vis kinetic monitoring of the surface plasmon band (530 nm) showed that absorbance starts to increase after 3 minutes. The reaction arrived to completion after 13 minutes and followed a first order rate law, with a kinetic constant of 4.3 × 10−3 s−1 (Fig. 2). This result was confirmed by following the disappearance of the HAuCl4 absorption band at 217 nm. The DLS monitoring confirmed the UV-Vis observation that the first measurable AuNPs appeared after 3 minutes. The AuNP hydrodynamic diameter steadily increased from 1.10 nm at the beginning to 1.87 nm at the end of the reaction (Fig. 3b). This result confirms that a higher UV intensity led to AuNPs with a smaller diameter. DLS analysis showed two distinct populations (Fig. 3a); one major centered around 1.87 nm (99.8 weight%) and a second minor centered around 31 nm (0.2 weight%) confirming that AuNPs are nearly monodispersed. A particularly interesting advantage of this high power UV LED irradiation system concerns the possibility to adjust the illumination power at the desired value (0–100%). When varying the UV light intensity from 350 mW cm−2 (100%) to 91 mW cm−2 (25%), we observed a linear correlation between the measured average hydrodynamic diameter by DLS and the light intensity. Using this property, it is then possible to directly select the AuNP diameter by applying the appropriate irradiation power according to the following equation:dAuNPs = −0.0384 × Iirr + 14.64 R2 = 0.97where d is the AuNP average hydrodynamic diameter in nanometers and Iirr corresponds to the light source irradiance in mW cm−2 measured using an UV power meter (Hamamatsu-C6080) at 1 cm from the source.

Despite many efforts, TEM analysis of AuNP colloid solution didn't furnish acceptable results. Indeed along deposition on TEM grids an agglomeration process is observed with the formation, on the border of the grid, of black vesicles corresponding to agglomerated 1–2 nm nanoparticles. In every case only the second minor population (average diameter = 30 ± 10 nm) presenting various shapes can be easily observed.
It must be pointed out that most of the TEM analysis of AuNPs in the nanometer range show AuNPs stabilized by strong ligands (thiols,27 phosphines,28 amino terminated ionic liquids29) whereas our AuNPs are only weakly stabilized.
Gold nanoparticle immobilization on PTFE
Preliminary experiments showed that the Teflon coated magnetic bar used for mixing AuNPs during their photochemical synthesis becomes purple-brown on the surface characteristic of AuNP deposition, suggesting that Teflon® could be a new support for AuNP catalysts. If the deposit of gold on the PTFE surface is well known either by ion beam assisted deposition on the surface30 or targeted electrochemical reduction of Au3+ solution31 there are very few reports on the chemical anchoring of AuNPs on PTFE. Recently Redel et al. described the deposition of AuNPs on the Teflon® surface by the UV irradiation of AuNP/BMIM+BF4− solution in the presence of PTFE.32 The authors detect an ESR signal for these AuNPs supported on PTFE particles. They assign this signal to a charge transfer between the AuNPs and the PTFE surface and the formation of (F⋯Au) interactions that explain the stability of the AuNPs on PTFE particles. These PTFE immobilized AuNPs have never been investigated as catalysts. Interestingly, PTFE is a support of choice for mild catalytic conditions. Indeed, its hydrophobic and inert character differs from the traditional AuNP catalyst supports (TiO2, SiO2, CeO2…) and turn out to be compatible with most of the organic solvents and so assure a high level of catalyst dispersion in solution. The support is known to have a strong influence on the reactivity of AuNP nanoparticles. So we expected that the very specific interaction between AuNPs and PTFE will lead to new catalytic properties.
The preparation of PTFE immobilized AuNP catalysts was preliminary evaluated by mixing commercially available PTFE microbeads (200 μm diameter) with the colloidal solution (Au concentration 3.3 × 10−4 mol L−1) resulting from the photochemical synthesis. Under such conditions, the hydrophobic PTFE powder remains on the water surface and did not disperse into the colloidal gold solution resulting in an inhomogeneous and extremely slow coloration of the support. The addition of acetone to the colloidal AuNP solution (acetone–water 50/50 vol/vol) drove the microbeads into the liquid phase, leading to a full decolorizing of the initially purple solution after 4 hours under mechanical shaking. The catalyst is finally collected as a purple-grey powder by filtration and UV-Vis analysis of the filtrate demonstrated the absence of any absorption in the range of 400–700 nm confirming a complete immobilization of gold on the PTFE surface. Assuming a complete deposition of AuNPs on the PTFE surface leads to the number of gold atoms per gram of the PTFE powder of 3.3 × 10−5 molAu gPTFE−1. The resulting powder has then been characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Using a classical SEM apparatus, only larger particles with an average diameter of 30 nm can be observed to be immobilized on the PTFE surface. We presently suppose that AuNPs agglomerate during their immobilization on the PTFE surface resulting in larger particles. Interestingly, SEM pictures show that larger particles are essentially located in cavities on PTFE microbeads surface (Fig. 4). This particular localization strongly suggests that a stabilization effect occurs when the support surface recovers the AuNP surface due to larger Au/F interactions.
 Fig. 4  SEM analysis of the PTFE immobilized AuNP surface. 
XPS analysis shows that compared to PTFE alone, PTFE immobilized AuNPs (AuNP/PTFE) presents an absorption band specific from the gold 4f orbital, confirming the absorption of AuNPs onto the PTFE surface (Table 1, AuNP/PTFE – Step 0). The Au 4f7/2 binding energy (BE) of the AuNP/PTFE is 84.8 eV, which falls between Au(0) BE (83.8 eV)33 and Au(I+) BE (85.0 eV),34 suggesting the coexistence of Au(I+) and Au(0) in the AuNP core (Fig. 5). These results are in agreement with the continuous wave EPR analysis of AuNP/PTFE performed at 5 K (Fig. 6). Indeed, the EPR spectrum presents two main peaks corresponding to Au(I+) at 353 gauss and a second intense superparamagnetic peak at 113 gauss to Au(0) clusters respectively.

 Fig. 6  AuNP/PTFE EPR (5 K) spectra. 
This hypothesis was confirmed by oxidation of AuNP/PTFE in the presence of H2O2 resulting in a slight increase of the Au(I+) peak at 353 gauss on the EPR spectrum. Similarly under reductive conditions in the presence of NaBH4 the EPR spectrum resulted in the complete disappearance of the Au(I+) peak and the appearance of a unique superparamagnetic peak at 113 gauss corresponding to Au(0).
Analysis of the carbon region by XPS (Fig. 5 and Table 1, AuNP/PTFE – Step 0), gave other fruitful information. PTFE is characterized by a single peak at 292.5 (±0.1) eV attributed to CF2 oligomers. When AuNPs are adsorbed on the surface, a new peak at 285.2 (±0.1) eV appears. As previous authors mentioned in the literature this new peak could correspond to CF2 decomposition along AuNP adsorption with the formation of C–C bonds.35,36 Such a peak is described to increase with the amount of adsorbed AuNPs suggesting the transformation of PTFE with AuNPs when anchoring. Here we suppose a fluorine abstraction with the formation of radicals that rearrange on the surface to form C–C bonds as recent literature studies mention the possibility to generate radicals from organic halides by halogen abstraction.37,38
Oxidative esterification of aldehydes
We evaluated our catalyst in hand for the oxidative esterification of aromatic aldehydes in methanol. Preliminary aerobic experiments on benzaldehyde in the presence of AuNP/PTFE (0.5 mol%) and a base demonstrated that at room temperature, molecular oxygen was not an appropriate co-oxidant for this reaction. This result is not surprising; as such oxidation conditions usually require high pressure of molecular oxygen to go to completion.39
We then decided to study the reaction in the presence of aqueous H2O2. A blank test was first carried out in which the benzaldehyde oxidative esterification was performed in the presence of H2O2 (1.5 eq.) and NaOH (2 eq.) in methanol. The reaction was extremely slow (Table 2, entry 1) with only 1% of methyl ester produced after 48 h. The GC/MS analysis shows that no Cannizaro reaction occurred under these conditions as no benzyl alcohol was detected. In the presence of a AuNP/PTFE catalyst (Table 2, entry 2) the reaction gave a fair yield after 24 h. Optimization of the base (Table 2, entries 2–4) demonstrated that strong bases such as t-BuOK (pKBH(H2O) = 17.0) or NaOH powder/pellets (pKBH(H2O) = 15.7) were preferred to weaker organic bases such as DBU (pKBH(H2O) = 12.0), for which no ester formation was observed even after 24 h. Strong bases which are able to quantitatively deprotonate methanol should accelerate the hemiacetal formation and the hydroperoxide anion formation required by the catalytic step. Because of its higher activity t-BuOK was chosen for the next experiments. The reaction appears to be very sensitive under temperature conditions (Table 2, entries 5 and 6). Interestingly yields are increased at lower temperatures. At the opposite at higher temperatures, the overall conversion dramatically decreases traducing inactivation of the catalytic system.

We observed in every catalytic experiment that gas bubbles appeared on the AuNP/PTFE surface. This could be explained by the formation of O2 along H2O2 decomposition catalyzed by AuNPs as previously described by Scaiano and Garcia according to the following equations:40–43 H2O2 + Au(0) → HO˙ + HO− + Au+(1) HO˙ + H2O2 → H2O + HOO˙(2) HOO˙ + Au+ → O2 + H+ + Au(0)(3) The side reaction which consumes H2O2 is accelerated by temperature which explains the observed yield decrease. For compensating H2O2 dismutation we multiplied its amount by two. The yield of methyl ester was higher but the yield of benzoic acid was also increased due to the introduction of larger amounts of water into the reaction medium (Table 2, entry 9). In order to achieve nearly complete conversions, we first increased the amount of catalyst (Table 2, entry 11). By doubling its amount the yield was increased by 20%. Finally we irradiated the mixture at room temperature using a green fluorescent bulb centered on the plasmon resonance absorption band (LEXMAN EQSS-3 15 W, λ = 525 ± 30 nm) which affords a further 5% increase (Table 2, entry 12).
In a next step the reaction was monitored by GC-MS. We observed a break in the kinetic rate after 19 minutes. Both parts of the kinetics follow an apparent zero order rate law with a reduced rate after 19 minutes. Under green irradiation the rate of oxidation reactions is accelerated and the break time is reduced to 15 minutes. The reaction is accelerated in the very first minutes and still follows an apparent zero order rate law. In the second part, the curve progresses at the same rate for standard and irradiated conditions (Fig. 7). This reactivity can be explained by the formation of a reactive species on the AuNP surface by H2O2 along the very first minutes.
 Fig. 7  Kinetic of benzoic acid methyl ester formation. Comparison between standard (◇), photocatalyzed (△), standard with repeated H2O2 additions (◆) and photocatalyzed with repeated H2O2 additions (▲) conditions. 
The second part of the curve can be explained by the presence of reactive oxygenated species resulting from H2O2 decomposition resulting in a second slower mechanism. The involvement of oxygen may be ruled out since the rate is not affected when the reaction is performed under a controlled atmosphere of argon. Successive addition of 1.5 equivalents of H2O2 every 20 minutes under standard conditions and every 15 minutes for photoactivated reaction maintained the reaction rate observed at the beginning of the reaction. This observation confirmed that H2O2 is the key element for generating the oxidative species on the AuNP surface. Under such repeated H2O2 addition conditions, the reaction proceeded faster to completion and kept a constant zero order reaction rate (Table 3). The time required for completion was reduced to 100 minutes under standard conditions and to only 45 minutes under green irradiation compared to 24 hours without repeated H2O2 additions.

Most of the developed AuNP based photocatalysts are usually combined with active composites or metal oxide supports44 for which, based on experimental characterization,45 a concomitant electronic transfer from the AuNPs to the support after photon adsorption, similar to that of a dye-sensitized solar cell, is envisaged to explain a certain catalytic redox reactivity on the support itself.46
In our case, considering the inert character of the PTFE support, such a mechanism can't reasonably be envisaged and this remarkable light effect can be justified by the generation of energetic and resonant electrons on the AuNP surface, after photon absorption, which strongly interact with the molecules adsorbed on the Au–NP surface and consequently enhance redox processes.
Interestingly, the selectivity toward the ester compared to acid under green irradiation and repeated additions of H2O2 is greatly enhanced as no trace of benzoic acid is observed. Such an effect on the selectivity has recently been observed by Ke et al. along AuNP photocatalyzed reduction.47 These results highlight important opportunities of light driven catalysis for the improvement of chemical selectivity and reactivity by avoiding any by-product formation.
When the esterification reaction is fast, no formation of benzoic acid is observed until the reaction is complete. At longer times, under such basic conditions, a slow hydrolysis of methyl ester is usually observed.
Similarly when outer sunlight was used instead of the green light under optimum solar conditions and repeated additions of 1.5 equivalents of H2O2 every 8 minutes (Table 3, entry 2), the excellent selectivity for the ester was maintained. Despite higher temperature conditions (32 °C) a good reactivity was also conserved compared with the reaction done under fluorescent tube room light (Table 3, entry 1), confirming the great potential of using sunlight instead of an artificial green light.
Then catalyst loading effect on the rate law has been studied in detail for benzaldehyde oxidative esterification (Table 3, entries 3–6, Fig. 8) and demonstrated as expected a linear relationship between the catalyst loading and the observed kinetic constant as expressed by the following equation:kobs = 4.09 × 105 × %cat. R2 = 0.99were kobs is the observed kinetic constant expressed in mol L−1 s−1 and %cat. corresponds to the catalyst loading based on gold atoms in percentage.

Hammett relationships
To study the influence of electronic effects of the substrate on the reaction rate we established Hammett relationships on para-substituted benzaldehydes (Table 4). Reaction is slower for electron donating substituents and high conversions and full selectivity for the ester, which is observed in every case. The observed rate constants are fitted by the classical σ substituent constants affording a positive ρ Hammett value (ρox = 2.35) with a good correlation factor (0.99) indicating that a partial negative charge is built up during the rate-determining step of the overall reaction pathway (Table 4 and Fig. 9, ● curve). Poor correlations were observed with Creary's substituent constants σC˙ and modified substituent constants σ− or σ+. This result strongly suggests that the rate limiting step of the overall reaction pathway is the hemiacetal formation. Previously, Christensen et al. investigated such Hammett relationships in the aerobic oxidation of alcohols and aldehydes, catalyzed by Au/TiO2.48,49 In the case of aldehyde oxidative esterification, for which no base was used compared to our system, the kinetics law was first order and only Creary's substituent constants for radical reaction (σC˙) fitted with the kinetic data. However, if p-CF3 is removed, the data are fitted almost identically by the classical σ substituent constants.

 Fig. 9  Hammett plots for experimentally measured log(kobsX/kobsH) = 2.35 × σ + 0.026 (●) and log(KHemiX/kHemiH) = 2.31 × σ − 0.07 (▲). 
The reported hemiacetal formation equilibria for substituted benzaldehydes in the presence of methanoate CH3O− has a large positive Hammett ρ value (ρHemi = 3.20).50,51 In the absence of base, the reported hemiacetal formation equilibrium Hammett plot has a much lower ρ value (ρHemi = 2.00) close to our measured value. These two positive Hammett ρ values strongly suggest that the rate determining step of the reaction referred to the hemiacetalisation step.
In order to confirm this hypothesis we measured by 1H NMR the hemiacetalisation equilibrium constants for the studied substituted benzaldehydes at the previous concentration (0.064 mol L−1) in CD3OD and in the presence of 2 equivalents of t-BuOK as the base (Table 4). As shown in Fig. 9, the corresponding Hammett plot presents a positive ρ value (ρHemi = 2.31; R2 = 0.98, ▲ curve) similar to the ρox value observed for the photocatalyzed oxidative esterification, confirming that the hemiacetalisation step in this pathway is the rate determining step.
Kinetic law
Kinetics results presented in Table 3 and Fig. 7 exhibit an apparent zero order rate law. Hammett relationships strongly suggest the hemiacetalisation step as the rate limiting step, consequently the hemiacetalisation equilibrium constant (KHemi) should influence the kinetic law of the reaction. Heterogeneous catalytic reactions take place on surfaces as described by Eley–Rideal or Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetic models.52 Such mechanisms have already been envisaged in the literature for other heterogeneous catalytic or photocatalytic reactions on the AuNP surface.53 The Eley–Rideal type mechanism describes a heterogeneous catalyzed pathway which assumes equilibrated adsorption of one reactant on the catalyst surface followed by a subsequent reaction with a second reagent in solution.54 In the case of a Langmuir–Hinshelwood type mechanism, this time, equilibrated adsorption of two reactants on the catalyst surface followed by their reactivity on the surface has to be considered.55
Such mechanisms are usually admitted for gas phase reactions and rarely extended to liquid phase reaction.56 In the present work an Eley–Rideal kinetic model is proposed in which hydrogen peroxide acts as an oxidant in solution and where the hemiacetal anion is adsorbed on the surface: (4)with:

k
r: the kinetic constant for hemiacetal anion oxidation on the surface KAds: hemiacetal anion adsorption equilibrium constant KHemi: hemiacetal anion formation equilibrium constant CS: surface gold atom concentration CH2O2: hydrogen peroxide concentration CBenz: benzaldehyde concentration.
Because H2O2 is added continuously to the reaction medium, we considered its concentration constant along time, the kinetic model was consequently simplified and resulted in the following integrated form:KeCBenz + ln(CBenz) = krCSCH2O2Ket + KeC0Benz − ln(C0Benz)Giving: (5)with: Ke = KAdsKHemi and ω: Lambert function.
This model justify apparent zero order reaction rates for low hemiacetal anion adsorption equilibrium constants (KAds < 10−4) and high kr values (kr > 103 s−1). The hemiacetal equilibrium step affecting the overall Ke expression of this model correlates with our preliminary assumption based on the hemiacetalisation step as the rate determining step.
Proposed reaction mechanism
Christensen et al. suggest the formation of a radical anion deriving from the aldehyde to explain such a correlation with an H˙ abstraction occurring with e.g. an Au–O–O– species in a radical recombination.
Assuming an Eley–Rideal type mechanism we may propose possible steps for the catalytic cycle (Fig. 10). Starting from AuNPs composed of Au(0) and Au(I+) atoms, under such basic conditions, hydrogen peroxide anions may oxidize the AuNP surface generating Au(I+)–OH species and as previously envisaged by Barton along DFT studies Au(I+)–O–O–Au(I+) intermediates.57 This could be justified by the increase of oxygen quantity observed by XPS after the reaction (Table 1, AuNP/PTFE – Step 1) or the increase of the Au(I+) peak at 353 Gauss observed by EPR in the presence of H2O2. Then, an Au(I+)–OH activated gold site may be exchanged with a preformed hemiacetal anion, resulting from the hemiacetalisation step between benzaldehyde and in situ generated CH3O−. This substitution generating Au(I+)–OCH(OCH3)Ar catalytic intermediate and an equivalent of hydroxide anion acting later as a strong base along H2O2 deprotonation or even along the hemiacetalisation step. The Au(I+)–O–O–Au(I+) active center may then undergo an intramolecular hydride abstraction from the adsorbed hemiacetal anion to generate by a concomitant electronic transfer on the AuNP surface hydroperoxide anion Au(I+)–OOH intermediate, Au(0) and the corresponding desired ester. The formation of the minor benzoic acid side product can also be explained using this pathway by the formation of an acetal in the presence of produced OH– instead of CH3O– and its adsorption/oxidation on the AuNP surface. To close the catalytic cycle an equivalent of hydroperoxide anion may regenerate Au(I+)–O–O–Au(I+) and Au(I+)–OH species on the AuNP surface to restart a new catalytic cycle. The existence of both hydroxide and hydroperoxide anions (Au(I+)–OH and Au(I+)–OOH) has been observed on the AuNP surface by XPS analysis by Falaras58 and studied in detail by DFT calculation along the reaction mechanism of formation of water from H2 and O2.57 The formation of an unusual Au(I+)–O–O–Au(I+) catalytic center is justified in our case by the highly basic reactive medium.
 Fig. 10  Schematic mechanisms of the reaction pathways in the photocatalytic oxidative esterification of aromatic aldehydes by AuNP/PTFE in the presence of H2O2 and a strong base. 
The only difference in the green light enhanced reaction is the polarization of AuNPs which enhances the electronic transfer in the proposed mechanism. In accord with the Hammett ρ value the rate limiting step in this overall pathway corresponds to the hemiacetalisation formation. The oxidation step on the AuNP surface should be considered as fast as proposed by the Eley–Rideal kinetic model.
Recycling of the catalyst
The AuNP/PTFE catalyst is perfectly stable after preparation and may be stored for weeks. We tested the recycling of the AuNP/PTFE catalyst in the oxidative esterification of benzaldehyde. After the first benzaldehyde oxidative esterification, the catalyst was separated from the reaction mixture by filtration, thoroughly washed with methanol, and then reused as catalyst for the next run under the same conditions. Along the second run, the conversion decreases to 59% after a longer reaction time of 45 minutes and the catalyst appears inactive along the third run. Observation of the catalyst after each step under a stereomicroscope demonstrated a change in the polymer shape (plates instead of beads). When the catalyst (250 mg) is treated for 2 hours with a solution of H2O2 (300 μL, 50w% in water) and acetone (5 mL) in water (5 mL), filtrated, and washed with methanol, as shown in Fig. 11, the methyl ester yields remained quantitative and constant for the ten successive cycles.
 Fig. 11  Recycling of the AuNP/PTFE catalyst (1%cat.) for the photocatalyzed oxidative esterification of benzaldehyde under repeated additions of H2O2 every 8 minutes. () without reactivation treatment between two runs; () with H2O2 (50%)/acetone/water treatment between 2 runs. The conversion is measured at 45 minutes by GC-MS. 
This result reflects the high stability and reusability of the regenerated catalyst. Surprisingly, when the catalyst is reactivated using this procedure, kinetic measurements demonstrated that for every successive run the selectivity is complete for the ester and that a zero order rate law is still observed. Furthermore the reaction is accelerated and complete after only 24 minutes compared to 30 minutes under standard conditions.
Interestingly for every run, a delay of 8 minutes is also observed before the beginning of the reaction suggesting a pre-activation of the AuNP surface under such new conditions. This delay shows also an exceptional reactivity (only 16 minutes of oxidation time) after pre-activation. When the AuNP/PTFE is treated with H2O2/acetone after each reaction step no change in the shape of the polymer beads is observed even after 10 cycles. This surface activation could be justified by in situ formation of a very reactive diluted triacetonetriperoxide species59 along reactivation treatment generating unidentified highly reactive intermediates on the AuNP surface. Nevertheless, XPS analysis of the treated AuNP catalyst (Table 1, AuNP/PTFE – Step 2) didn't show any significant change compared to the AuNP catalyst after reaction without recycling treatment (Table 1, AuNP/PTFE – Step 1).
By comparison with previously reported oxidative esterification reactions catalyzed by gold nanoparticles immobilized on various mineral supports in the presence of O260–64 our catalytic system appears to be more stable and more active after the recycling step. Indeed, by comparison with most of the mineral supports usually evaluated, the catalyst preparation is usually complex and its activity usually decreases after few cycles. To our knowledge, from the best recyclable AuNP catalysts, Au–K2CO3 reported by Gao65 was reused 8 times without the loss of activity but by comparison our mild catalytic system requires less energy (15 W light instead of usual high temperatures or high O2 pressures) and appears to be much faster than most of the catalytic systems using O2 as the co-oxidant.
Conclusions
Homogeneous unstabilized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) of 1 to 2 nm diameter were obtained by photochemical reduction of Au(3+) solution by a high intensity UV LED source. These AuNPs supported on polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) are efficient catalysts for the photocatalytic oxidative esterification of aldehydes with aqueous hydrogen peroxide under mild conditions. The inert nature of the PTFE polymer allowed us to work in hydrophobic solvents under nearly anhydrous conditions, which led to nearly absence of the formation of benzoic acid.
Hammett free energy relationship study demonstrated that hemiacetalisation equilibrium is the rate limiting step. The overall reaction obeys a zero order rate law which follows an Eley–Rideal model, based on previously described intermediates, a catalytic cycle on the gold surface is proposed.
The recycling study opened the way to new and efficient regenerating conditions for AuNP catalysts and the exceptional reactivity of such new catalysts has to be elucidated. Furthermore, preliminary results seem to show an important effect of the AuNP size, measured after their photochemical synthesis, on catalytic activity, these results will be reported in due course.
Further work is necessary to rationalize this effect.
Parallel to this work, we recently described the transposition of batch reaction into AuNP immobilized capillary flow reactors allowing a better control of the reaction. The design of AuNP/PTFE based catalytic microreactors is of high interest, and will be reported in due course. Further extension of the present H2O2–AuNP/PTFE catalytic system to other key oxidative transformations is currently being explored. In summary AuNPs supported on PTFE extend the traditional support of AuNPs and have great potential as photocatalysts for the development of environmentally benign reactions.
