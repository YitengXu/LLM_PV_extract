    , Accepted 19th November 2014First published on 20th November 2014AbstractCl incorporation has been reported to be able to significantly increase the diffusion length of carriers in organo-lead halide perovskite thin films. However, due to the low solubility of PbCl2, Cl incorporation has been rarely reported in a two-step process, which is capable of producing uniform organo-lead halide perovskite thin films. In this letter, we report a novel growth method that combines the two-step process and Cl incorporation. The Cl-incorporated organo-lead halide perovskite solar cell made from a two-step process demonstrated a power conversion efficiency of 10.5%, which is 27% higher than that without Cl incorporation. Further investigation was performed to explore the fundamentals of the enhancement. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) measurement revealed a larger band bending at grain boundaries with Cl incorporation, which brings the Fermi level of the bulk perovskite thin film closer to the center of the bandgap. As a result, a p–i–n type of junction is formed in the devices with Cl incorporation, which facilitates the charge carrier collection. Additional carrier lifetime measurements indicate that the electron lifetime in the perovskite thin film with Cl incorporation is longer, indicating reduced recombination in the devices with Cl incorporation.
Introduction
Methylammonium lead halide perovskites have emerged as promising photovoltaic (PV) materials because of their excellent optical properties such as high absorption coefficients for a broad range of sunlight absorption.1 Moreover, the abundance of raw materials and the ability of being solution processed make methylammonium lead halide perovskites more suitable for low cost PV technologies. High power conversion efficiencies of more than 15% have been reported from both mesoporous structure devices and planar structure devices.1–5 Planar structure devices are more advantageous than mesoporous structure devices because the high temperature annealing necessary for mesoporous structures is not required for planar structure devices. Thus, low temperature processing, which is suitable for plastic solar cells, can be applied to fabricate methylammonium lead halide perovskite solar cells. Conversion efficiency in excess of 10% has been reported for a methylammonium lead halide perovskite solar cell fabricated on plastic substrates.3
To date, two processes have been developed to fabricate planar perovskite solar cells. The first process is called the one-step process, where a metal halide is mixed with methylammonium iodide and the as-synthesized methylammonium lead halide perovskite is spin-coated on substrates. The other process is called the two-step process, where a metal halide is spin-coated on substrates and methylammonium lead halide perovskite is formed by inserting the substrates into a methylammonium iodide solution. In the one-step process, two metal halides, lead iodide (PbI2) and lead chloride (PbCl2), have been commonly used to synthesize methylammonium lead halide perovskites, which are denoted as MAPbI3 and MAPb(I,Cl)3, respectively, with the MAPb(I,Cl)3 solar cells leading in performance due to the long diffusion length of its carriers.6,7 Nevertheless, it is extremely difficult to control the morphology of perovskite thin films because it is significantly affected by the environment of the one-step process.8 In the two-step process, the morphology of the perovskite thin film is very uniform.3 However, PbI2 has been exclusively used because the solubility of PbCl2 is extremely low. Therefore, the advantages associated with Cl incorporation cannot be considered.
In this paper, we report a novel two-step growth method which combines Cl incorporation using a mixed halide source. It is found that the short current density (JSC) has been significantly improved by 28% after Cl incorporation. As a result, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.5% was obtained from a solution-processed planar perovskite solar cell.
Results and discussion
Planar perovskite solar cells were fabricated in air with the structure FTO/TiO2/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD/Au. A modified two-step process capable of incorporating Cl was used to grow the perovskite thin films. The experimental procedures for the two-step growth are briefly shown in Fig. 1. First, a PbI2 solution (dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) with a concentration of 460 mg ml−1) was spin coated at 4000 RPM for 30 s. After drying in air, the substrates with the PbI2 thin film were separated into two batches. The first batch was dipped into a solution containing a single halide source (CH3NH3I (MAI) dissolved in 2-propanol (IPA) with a concentration of 20 mg ml−1). These samples were denoted as MAPbI3. The second batch was dipped into a solution containing a mixed halide source (MAI and CH3NH3Cl (MACl) dissolved in 2-propanol with concentrations of 20 mg ml−1 and 2 mg ml−1, respectively). These samples were named MAPb(I,Cl)3.
 Fig. 1  Schematic growth process for perovskite thin films using a mixed halide source. 
The content of Cl was checked by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The EDS spectra of MAPb(I,Cl)3 and MAPbI3 thin films are shown in Fig. S1.† The weight ratios of Pb, I, and Cl derived from the EDS spectra are summarized in Table S1.† The weight ratios of Cl in MAPb(I,Cl)3 and MAPbI3 thin films are same. This indicates that the concentration of Cl in MAPb(I,Cl)3 should be lower than the detection limit of the EDS system because no Cl was intentionally added to the so-called MAPbI3 thin film.
The PbI2 thin film is continuous and the substrate is fully covered by the PbI2 thin film, as shown in Fig. 2a and b. It is evident that the PbI2 thin film consists of crystals with sizes varying from tens to a few hundred nanometers. The reaction between PbI2 and MAI occurs efficiently due to the ordered crystal structure of the PbI2 thin film, which facilitates the intercalation of MAI into the lattice to form MAPbI3. The SEM images of the surfaces of the MAPbI3 and MAPb(I,Cl)3 thin films are shown in Fig. 2c–f. Due to the uniformity of the PbI2 thin film, which possibly modifies the interaction between the substrate and the perovskite thin film, the resulting perovskite thin films are homogeneous and densely packed. This demonstrates the advantage of the two-step process for preparing perovskite thin films, compared to the one-step process which usually leads to incomplete coverage of the substrate.8 In the case of the MAPb(I,Cl)3 thin film that was prepared using a mixed halide source, no difference is observed in the morphology, indicating that the addition of MACl does not affect the growth of the perovskite thin film and the interaction between the substrate and the perovskite thin film. The SEM cross-section images of the PbI2, MAPbI3, and MAPb(I,Cl)3 thin films are shown in Fig. 2g–i, respectively. There is no region with complete absence of the absorber. This prevents the shunting path that is partially responsible for the lower fill factor and open-circuit voltage in the one-step processed perovskite solar cells.

The XRD patterns of the PbI2, MAPbI3, and MAPb(I,Cl)3 thin films are shown in Fig. 3. A strong diffraction peak at 12.63° is observed for the PbI2 thin film. This corresponds to the (001) lattice plane of crystallized PbI2, indicating the polycrystalline nature of the deposited PbI2 thin film.1,9 Both MAPbI3 and MAPb(I,Cl)3 thin films demonstrate a comparatively strong diffraction peak at 14.07°, which corresponds to the tetragonal structured perovskite.10 The similarity of the XRD patterns indicates that the growth of the perovskite thin film is not structurally affected by the addition of MACl. For MAPbI3 and MAPb(I,Cl)3 thin films, the PbI2 diffraction peak at 12.63° still exists in addition to the perovskite diffractions, indicating that the PbI2 was not fully converted into perovskite.

The J–V curves (under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G illumination) of the best perovskite solar cells are shown in Fig. 4, and the PV parameters are summarized in Table 1. The most efficient MAPbI3 solar cell has a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 17.60 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.90 V and a fill factor (FF) of 52%, yielding an efficiency (η) of 8.29%. The best MAPb(I,Cl)3 solar cell produced a JSC of 22.58 mA cm−2, an VOC of 0.91 V and a FF of 51%, resulting in an overall efficiency of 10.49%. The improvement of performance mainly comes from the significant enhancement in the JSC, which is improved by 28%. This improved JSC cannot be attributed to stronger light absorption because MAPb(I,Cl)3 thin film had a similar absorption spectrum with that of the MAPbI3 thin film, as shown in Fig. 2S.† This could be attributed to the long diffusion length of the carriers in the MAPb(I,Cl)3 thin film. The averaged I–V parameters are summarized in Table S2.† Although the best MAPbI3 and MAPb(I,Cl)3 solar cells demonstrated comparable VOC, a higher averaged VOC was obtained from MAPb(I,Cl)3 solar cells.

To investigate the mechanisms behind the significant improvement in the performance of MAPb(I,Cl)3 solar cells, the surface potential (SP) distributions of both materials were mapped using single-pass Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM).11 As shown in Fig. 5, the dark regions around the grain boundaries indicate the band bending that favours electron accumulation. The KPFM measurement of MAPbI3 shows a uniform distribution of SP among the grain bodies and grain boundaries, indicating a narrower and smaller band bending, while the KPFM measurement of MAPb(I,Cl)3 shows a large variation of SP among the grain bodies and grain boundaries, indicating a deeper and wider band bending at the grain boundaries.

MAPbI3 was found to be a p-type material,1 thus a single p–n heterojunction should be formed at the cathode side of the device (Fig. 6a). For this single p–n heterojunction, an electron blocking layer is needed on the anode side. The charge collection efficiency is higher on the junction side (cathode) but lower on the anode side because only diffusion contributes to the charger transport on the anode side. The observation of wider and deeper band bending at the grain boundaries of MAPb(I,Cl)3 from the KPFM measurements indicates that electron accumulation is enhanced at the grain boundaries, thus bringing the Fermi level closer to the center band to make MAPb(I,Cl)3 less p-type. Such Fermi level shift results in a p–i–n heterojunction in the device (Fig. 6b), which was first speculated in mesoporous MAPb(I,Cl)3 solar cells12 and later observed in planar MAPb(I,Cl)3 solar cells by an electron beam-induced current study.13 The p–i–n heterojunction facilitates the charge collection on both sides because both drift and diffusion contribute to the charge transport. In addition, the junction on the anode side provides a blocking barrier to prevent electrons reaching the anode, thus reducing the recombination loss.

The measurement of electron lifetime can be applied to quantify the extent of electron recombination in perovskite solar cells.14 The dependence of the electron lifetime on the VOC for planar perovskite solar cells fabricated with single and mixed halide sources is shown in Fig. 7. It clearly demonstrates that the electron lifetime of the MAPb(I,Cl)3 solar cells is longer than that of the MAPbI3 solar cell. This suggests that the electrons in the MAPb(I,Cl)3 thin film can survive longer and demonstrate a longer diffusion length, as reported in the literature.6,7
 Fig. 7  The electron lifetime as a function of VOC. 
The longer electron lifetime in MAPb(I,Cl)3 solar cells, indicating a reduced recombination, can also be explained by the KPFM observation. The lack of SP difference at the grain boundaries and grain bulk of MAPbI3 may render free carriers generated during illumination to easily recombine, thus shortening carrier lifetime. On the contrary, the large variation of SP between the grain boundary and grain bulk means abundant potential wells are formed at the grain boundaries to accommodate electrons, which physically separate electrons from holes preventing the carrier recombination. In addition, the locally formed junctions between the grain bodies and grain boundaries enhance the dissociation of excitons and further suppress recombination. As a result, carrier lifetime is greatly improved in MAPb(I,Cl)3 solar cells.
Photocurrent hysteresis has been reported in perovskite devices, which strongly depends on the fabrication processes, the scanning rate and the direction of the voltage applied during the I–V characterization.15 To truly reflect the I–V performance of the perovskite solar cells reported in this work, the voltage was swept either from −0.1 V to 1.1 V (forward bias) or from 1.1 V to −0.1 V (reverse bias) at a rate of 10 mV s−1 with a step of 10 mV per step. As shown in Fig. S3,† no obvious hysteresis was observed in the I–V curve by changing the sweeping direction of the voltage.
Although the efficiency of the perovskite solar cells obtained in this work is not high compared with those reported in the literature,1–5 there is still plenty of room to improve. The comparatively low performance could possibly be attributed to the incomplete conversion of PbI2, as confirmed by the XRD results. Attempts to reduce the PbI2 residue are still on-going in our research. Furthermore, the novel growth method for perovskite thin films proposed in this work could further improve the performance of perovskite solar cells by utilizing other techniques, such as using DMSO to dissolve PbI2 and interdiffusion process, as suggested in the literature.1,9 Considering that the devices were fabricated using a solution process in atmosphere, our method should be promising for low-cost PV technologies.
Conclusions
The mixed halide source method proposed in this work can be applied to combine the advantages of the two-step process and Cl incorporation. A larger band-bending at grain boundaries with Cl incorporation, revealed by KPFM measurements, suggest that a p–i–n type of heterojunction junction is formed in the devices with Cl incorporation. The p–i–n junction facilitates charge carrier collection and reduces recombination. Planar perovskite solar cells with uniform morphology can be fabricated by the two-step solution process, and the performance can be improved by Cl incorporation. This technique can be easily combined with other highly efficient growth methods. A higher performance could be expected for solution-processed, planar perovskite solar cells.
Experimental procedures
Synthesis of CH3NH3I and CH3NH3Cl
CH3NH3I and CH3NH3Cl were synthesized according to a reported procedure.5 CH3NH3I was synthesized by reacting 30 ml of methylamine (40% in methanol, TCI) and 32.3 ml of hydroiodic acid (57 wt% in water, Aldrich) in an ice bath for 2 h with stirring. The precipitate was collected through the removal of solvents by a rotary evaporator. The as-obtained product was washed three times with diethyl ether, and then recrystallized from a mixed solvent of diethyl ether and ethanol. After filtration, the final CH3NH3I was collected and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h. CH3NH3Cl was synthesized by reacting 30 ml of methylamine (40% in methanol, TCI) and 20.4 ml of hydrochloric acid (37 wt% in water, Aldrich) in an ice bath for 2 h with stirring. The precipitation and collection of CH3NH3Cl was carried out using the same procedure used for CH3NH3I.
Fabrication of perovskite solar cells
PbI2 (1 M) was dissolved in DMF and spin coated on patterned TiO2-coated FTO glass substrates at 4000 RPM for 30 s. After drying on a hotplate at 70 °C for 30 min, the samples were separated into two batches. The first batch was dipped into a solution containing a single halide source (CH3NH3I was dissolved in 2-propanol (IPA) with a concentration of 20 mg ml−1). These samples were denoted as MAPbI3. The second batch was dipped into a solution containing a mixed halide source (CH3NH3I and CH3NH3Cl dissolved in IPA with concentrations of 20 mg ml−1 and 2 mg ml−1, respectively). These samples were named as MAPb(I,Cl)3. The dipping was maintained for 5 min. The samples were washed by IPA and then heated at 100 °C for 30 min. A layer of an electron blocking material based on spiro-OMeTAD (80 mg spiro-OMeTAD, 29 μl tBP and 18 μl Li-TFSI solution (520 mg Li-TFSI in 1 ml acetonitrile) all dissolved in 1 ml chlorobenzene) was deposited on the perovskite thin film by spin-coating at 4000 RPM for 30 s. Please note that all the processes mentioned above were carried out in air. Finally, a gold layer with a thickness of 100 nm was deposited by electron beam evaporation with a mask. The active area of the perovskite solar cells was 4 mm2, which was defined by the overlap of Au and FTO layers, and separated from the surrounding area by mechanical scribing.
Characterization
A UV-visible spectrometer (Agilent 8453) was used to obtain the absorbance of the perovskite thin films. SEM images were obtained using a scanning electron microscope (Philips XL30-FEG). X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were obtained using an XRD system (PANalytical X'Pert Pro MRD), which was equipped with a CuKα1 X-ray generator. Current–voltage responses were measured using an Agilent 4155C semiconductor parameter analyzer under airmass 1.5 global (AM 1.5 G) 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) illumination, which was calibrated using a light intensity meter. No mask was applied during the I–V characterization. The voltage was swept from −0.1 V to 1.1 V at a rate of 10 mV s−1 with a step of 10 mV per step. For the hysteresis investigation, the voltage was swept either from −0.1 V to 1.1 V (forward bias) or from 1.1 V to −0.1 V (reverse bias) at a rate of 10 mV s−1 with a step of 10 mV per step. KPFM measurement was carried out using an Agilent 5500 AFM with MAC III mode. The conductive AFM tip (Veeco SCM-PIT, k = 2.8 N m−1, coated with Pt/Ir) was simultaneously excited by mechanical drive at its resonant frequency (75 kHz), and by electrical drive around 10 kHz.
