    , Accepted 29th March 2012First published on 3rd April 2012AbstractA new spectroscopic tool for the quantitative evaluation of dye-sensitizer uptake into TiO2 semiconductor films for application in DSCs is presented, here applied to N719 dye and TiO2-dye dipping times spanning from a few seconds up to 24 h. By the integration of the whole absorption spectrum in the Vis range or of the most significant low-energy peak, a conversion table could be built to be used as a reliable tool for evaluating the amount of adsorbed dye from the spectral response of the dye-coated films, independently of any spectral modification of the response with dipping time (indeed observed). In particular for N719 under the investigated conditions, we have demonstrated that the first hour is strategic for an effective uptake of the dye by the TiO2 nanoparticles, with a saturation level reached within the first 5 h, suggesting that commonly used longer dipping times, typically 16–24 h, are useless or even undesirable when making DSC devices. In addition, we have found that the whole adsorption process, from few seconds up to 24 h dipping time, is very nicely described by a simple pseudo-first order kinetic model, in contrast with previous findings, with an observed rate constant of 3.1 × 10−4 s−1.
Introduction
Capture of sunlight has attracted an increasing interest in the scientific community and triggered academic interest for the development of efficient and cheap photovoltaic devices.1 Amongst new generation thin film technologies for solar energy conversion, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) show an optimal trade-off between high-conversion efficiency and low-cost manufacturing.2,3 The sensitizer dye, which absorbs photons generating electron–hole pairs at the interface between the inorganic semiconductor (TiO2) and the redox electrolyte, plays a key role in the whole photovoltaic process. The Ru(II) complex bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylate)ruthenium(II) (N719) is the most representative DSC sensitizer, with power conversion efficiencies exceeding 11% in a DSC device.4
One of the fundamental components of DSC devices is the working electrode which is formed by a combination of a nanocrystalline porous TiO2 film, endowed with a large adsorptive surface area, and the dye sensitizer, which is the active species for light harvesting. Working photoelectrodes are routinely fabricated by depositing one or more layers of TiO2 films either transparent (typically made of 20 nm diameter particles) or opaque/light-scattering (typically made of larger, 350–450 nm diameter particles) on F-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass plates by a variety of techniques, commonly including screen-printing or manual squeegee techniques.5 After thermal treatment, the TiO2 electrode is immersed into the dye solution (10−3 to 10−4 M) at room temperature for 20–24 h to assure complete sensitizer uptake.
A few studies4 have reported a strong effect of different dye dipping times on the photovoltaic performance of the cell. This in turn derives from the magnitude (amount of adsorbed dye on the TiO2 surface) and from the kinetics of the adsorption process.6,7 To this concern, the effective loading of the dye in the TiO2 electrode is of paramount relevance for controlling, and eventually optimizing, photovoltaic cell parameters. In particular, the cell short-circuit current Jsc is directly proportional to the light harvesting ability of the cell, which in turn is strictly dependent on dye concentration on the TiO2 adsorptive surface.8 In addition, the dye adsorption behavior directly affects the cell open-circuit voltage Voc as well.9 Notwithstanding this, relatively few methods are known today for quantitative evaluation of the total dye adsorbed. Indirect ex situ surface coverage studies based on dye adsorption–desorption process represent the most common tool: the amount of adsorbed dye is determined by desorbing the dye from the TiO2 surface by treating the sample with a hydroalcoholic solution of NaOH and then measuring the desorbed dye concentration by spectroscopy in the ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectral range.10 A similar, more reliable, method, has also been proposed,11 based on the measurement of diffuse reflectance on the dyed TiO2. These techniques have the advantage of allowing a quantitative determination of dye loading but they are time-consuming and represent inherently indirect methods, since the measurement is not carried out directly on the adsorbed dye.
More recently, a new method for a quantitative estimation of the adsorbed dye based on photoelectron spectroscopy has been proposed.12 This technique is powerful but also destructive and not easily accessible, and gives only the relative concentrations of the different elements, then used to indirectly determine the amount of adsorbate molecules. Considering direct methods, non-destructive techniques which can be applied in situ, during adsorption of the dye on the TiO2 surface, have been proposed.13,14 Watson et al.13 performed the analysis by monitoring the color intensity during dye uptake as well as by measuring diffuse reflectance. They compare the two methods and discuss the dependence of dye uptake on the TiO2 thickness and on the dye solution concentration, without giving a model for the kinetics. As drawbacks, we note that both techniques need a transparent photoanode substrate, they can work only at a few wavelengths, and cannot separate the dye signal detected from the adsorbing film or from the native solution. An alternative in situ method was proposed by Peic et al.,14 based on attenuated total reflection at the interface between the dye solution and the TiO2 film. It gives the total amount of adsorbed dye, but it is applicable only after the ad hoc deposition of a metallic film; moreover, it works at a fixed wavelength, which means detecting only a few dyes and not always at the maximum sensitivity. As for the description of the adsorption mechanisms, an interesting approach is the combined use of several spectroscopies, as proposed years ago by Leon et al.;15 such an approach is not used any longer, possibly because it needs several different measurements, some of them requiring specific electrodes.
A few studies have focused attention on the kinetics of the dye uptake process.7,11,13 Very recently the loading kinetics of two dyes on TiO2 photoanodes were compared under different conditions, continuous flow or static impregnation, showing that for N719 the two processes are equivalent. In that work, an in situ UV-Vis real-time monitoring has been used, although quantitative measurements were taken at a single wavelength of the dye spectrum, sometimes far from the maximum absorption due to saturation problems. It should be noted that in this, and other works,13 different adsorption process phases, a rapid initial dye uptake followed by a slower adsorbed dye increase, have been proposed. This has been rationalized in terms of a rapid surface chemisorption and a simultaneous slower mass transfer process (dye diffusion through the solution to the TiO2 nanoparticles and percolation of the dye through the porous film).16 Park et al. have measured the amount of adsorbed dye on the TiO2 surface as a function of immersion time of the semiconductor film in the dye solution finding a pseudo-first order adsorption kinetics.6 Once again, the adsorbed dye was quantitatively determined from the absorbance of a solution of desorbed dye at a single wavelength.
Within this framework, in the present paper we propose a new protocol for a fully reliable quantitative evaluation of dye uptake by a nanocrystalline porous TiO2 film. This protocol consists of setting a conversion table between the characteristics of the UV-Vis optical spectra of the dye-coated TiO2 electrode films after different durations of dipping in a prototypical dye solution and the optical absorption of the desorbed dye, properly calibrated through freshly prepared solutions. We choose the prototypical dye N719 and dipping times varying from 5 s up to 24 h. We believe that the proposed protocol has some advantages over the previously reported methods. Firstly, the response of the films is analysed over a sufficiently broad wavelength range rather than at a fixed wavelength: in this way we get more reliable information on the absorption intensity, even in the presence of a peak shift upon different dye loadings. Secondly, we use a different TiO2 film for each uptake time, thus allowing direct comparison and conversion of the optical density of the dye-coated film and that of the corresponding desorbed dye.
Experimental
Materials and instruments
The following materials were purchased from commercial suppliers: FTO-coated glass plates (2.2 mm thick; sheet resistance ∼7 ohm per square; Solaronix); TiO2 (15–20 nm anatase particles for transparent sintered layers; Solaronix); and N719 (Dyesol). Optical measurements were performed using a Perkin-Elmer spectrometer Lambda900.
Preparation of dye-coated TiO2 electrodes
The FTO-coated glass plates were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath using a solution of pure water and Mucasol detergent (10:1) and absolute ethanol. A first transparent layer of the TiO2 paste was screen-printed; the film was then exposed to EtOH vapors for a few minutes in a container and dried at 125 °C. A second layer of TiO2 was then screen-printed and the same treatment repeated. The multilayers were submitted to the following thermal treatment: 325 °C for 10 min, 450 °C for 15 min, and 500 °C for 15 min. After spectroscopic measurements, the TiO2 films were heated up to 80 °C and immersed into 4 mL of a solution of N719 in EtOH (0.5 mM) in the dark and in air for a specific period of time, then rinsed with acetonitrile and dried under a nitrogen stream. The obtained N719-coated TiO2 films have a square shape, 4 × 4 mm2 in size and about 5 μm in thickness, with a rough surface. A set of 16 samples has been prepared in this way, varying the dipping time in the dye bath from 5 s to 24 h.
Spectroscopic measurements as a function of dye uptake time
The whole set of 16 samples was submitted to spectroscopic investigation in transmission configuration at normal incidence in the spectral range 300–800 nm. A light spot size of about 3 mm2 has been used for collecting transmitted light from the middle of the dye-coated TiO2 film. Due to the reduced thickness of the substrate and the size of TiO2 nanoparticles, the effect of the straylight due to the diffuse reflectance of the TiO2 film can be considered negligible (as checked on a few substrates). Transmission measurements have been performed on all the TiO2 films before and after dye uptake, for each sample. The spectrum collected before dying was used for normalizing the one collected after dying.
The amount of adsorbed dye has been measured for each sample by desorbing the dye, after the spectroscopic investigation on the dye-coated films, using a 0.1 M solution of NaOH in ethanol–H2O (1:1) and by measuring its UV-Vis spectrum in a known volume of the solution. Comparison with the spectra of freshly prepared solutions of the dye in the same solvent, at known concentrations, was used to determine the amounts of desorbed dye. Transmission measurements of dye-desorbed solutions have been performed by using the same spectrometer in the spectral range 200–800 nm, in a quartz cuvette with an optical path of 10 mm.
Results and discussion
Spectroscopic investigation of dye uptake

Fig. 1 shows the optical response of the N719 dye adsorbed on the TiO2 film, as obtained after correction of the spectra of each sample with its substrate prior to dying, for a number of selected dipping times. According to the spectrum of N719 in EtOH solution,4 the optical signature of the N719 dye can be detected at about 540 and 400 nm for all of the different dipping times. A shoulder on the low energy tail of the former peak can be clearly detected at ca. 630 nm, regardless of the used dipping time. The two main bands in the higher energy region are ascribed to t2g → π* metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transitions, and are common to bipyridine based DSC Ru(II) complexes.17 The effect of the adsorption on the TiO2 layer is a bathochromic shift of the MLCT band, with the low energy main peak shifting from 530 nm in EtOH to 539 nm in the film.4,18 The shoulder at low energy was recently computed to be ascribed to a singlet–singlet transition of the N719 dye molecule at 649 nm mainly described by the HOMO–LUMO+11 orbital excitation.18

It is worth noting that the spectral lineshape does not significantly vary over the different dipping times, with relative intensity of the peaks almost unvaried even for the shortest times, for which a significant change in overall intensity was recorded. The most evident feature is that the spectral position of the peaks slightly shifts as the dipping time increases. In particular, the main peaks at 540 and 395 nm show a red-shift to 544 and 400 nm, respectively, for dipping times longer than 10 min. This behavior can be either due to aggregation phenomena of dye molecules on the TiO2 surface, as suggested by the increasing dye loading and supported by recent computational results,19 or due to protonation equilibria as the dye interacts with TiO2.20 This clearly demonstrates that performing a single wavelength measurement as reported in the literature (see Introduction), even under a real-time monitoring of dye uptake, might lead to a partially incorrect quantitative conclusion. In the case of N719 the effect is rather small, nonetheless clearly detectable.
In order to investigate the kinetics of the dying process, on the basis of the aforementioned discussion we have not considered reliable the estimation of the absorption intensity via a single wavelength. We have thus applied two different methods for evaluating the relative absorption intensity at different dipping times: (i) by integrating the area of the absorption spectra over the UV-Vis spectral range (460–800 nm) and (ii) by integrating the area of the most important MLCT peak, centered around 540 nm, after performing a deconvolution of the three detected UV-Vis peaks. The fitting procedure was carried out by selecting three Gaussian curves with fixed spectral position and width; the area of the peaks together with the offset were the unique parameters to be fitted for each spectrum. An example of the results of the fitting procedure adopted for determining the area of the 540 nm band is depicted in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The results of the second method are shown in Fig. 2 and listed in Table 1 (see ESI, Fig. S2† for the corresponding plot obtained after integrating the full area). It is possible to identify two characteristic temporal regions with regard to the increasing dye loading as a function of dipping time. A first lapse of time, from a few s to approximately 1 h, is characterized by a steep increase of the absorption intensity and therefore dye uptake, while a subsequent temporal region (in the range of hours up to 1 day) is described by a much slower growth. The dye uptake is levelled off after 4–5 h, with a limited increase for longer dipping times up to 24 h.

With the aim of quantitatively determining the amount of adsorbed dye for each sample, N719 was completely desorbed from the TiO2 films. The solutions of the desorbed dye were then measured by means of UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy. Fig. 3 shows the absorption spectra of the solutions of the desorbed dye as a function of the dipping time of the original films. The optical response is characterized by the presence of three distinct peaks centered at about 510, 380, and 310 nm. The former two peaks correspond to the MLCT bands, whereas the highest energy peak (actually, a doublet), at 310 nm, is due to π → π* intraligand transitions.
 Fig. 3  UV-Vis spectra of desorbed N719 (0.1 M NaOH in H2O–EtOH 1:1) vs. dipping times of the original films (inset: enlargement of the MLCT band). 
Similarly as for the spectra of the dye-coated TiO2 films, a shoulder on the long wavelength tail of the low energy peak can be recorded at about 600 nm. We also note that, once again similarly to dye-adsorbed films, the spectral position of the peak at about 510 nm slightly varies with the contact time, albeit in this case the spectral position of the other peaks remains almost unchanged. More precisely, the low energy peak is centered at 505 nm at low concentrations of the dye and undergoes a red-shift to 512 nm for higher concentrations, corresponding to dipping times longer than 20 min.
Here, protonation equilibria should not be the reason for the observed bathochromic shift at higher concentrations, all of the carboxylic functionalities being present as deprotonated carboxylates COO−. Therefore, it is likely that dye aggregation is responsible for such a spectral shift.19
The optical response of the desorbed solutions matches that of freshly prepared solutions of the N719 sensitizer in the same hydroalcoholic NaOH solution (the comparison between a 2 × 10−6 M freshly prepared solution and a desorbed solution at 3 h dipping time is shown in ESI, Fig. S3†). Thus, it is easy to quantify the amount of desorbed N719, i.e. the original amount of the dye loaded into TiO2, by comparing the spectra corresponding to each dipping time to those of freshly made solutions at known concentrations. Because of the peak shift with concentration, quantitative measurements based on a single wavelength were not considered reliable to determine the amount of dye. Therefore, as for the spectra of the films, the dye loading vs. dipping time was determined from the spectra in Fig. 3 by using either the integrated area of the absorption spectra in the full spectral range 277–800 nm (ESI, Fig. S4†) or the integrated area of the peak centered at about 510 nm (ESI, Fig. S5†) after a deconvolution into its five spectral components (ESI, Fig. S6†). Table 1 collects the data obtained by using the latter method, together with the integrated areas of the peak at about 540 nm in the film spectra in Fig. 2. In this respect, Table 1 can be therefore regarded as a conversion table for a fast evaluation of the amount of adsorbed dye from the film spectrum.
Kinetics of the adsorption process
The adsorption process of a generic dye-sensitizer S on the TiO2 active sites of the film can be described by the relationship (1) where S:TiO2 represents the dye-coated TiO2 sites of the film. (1)
The overall rate of reaction r of the dynamic process is given by the rate of the direct reaction (adsorption) minus the rate of the inverse reaction (desorption). By assuming first-order reactants and products,6 the rate is given by eqn (2), with kD and kI being the rate constants of the direct and inverse reactions, respectively: r = d[S:TiO2]/dt = −d[S]/dt = −d[TiO2]/dt = kD[S][TiO2] − kI [S:TiO2](2)
Even at full saturation the amount of adsorbed dye (in the range of 10−8 mol cm−2 of TiO2 active area) is orders of magnitude lower than the amount of free dye molecules in the solution (a concentration of 0.5 mM corresponds to 2 × 10−6 mol of dye in 4 mL of dye bath). In addition, in the absence of desorbing reactants such as NaOH, the desorption process is very slow, as demonstrated by the fact that a N719-coated film immersed in a bath of pure solvent does not release enough dye to be detectable. Taking this into account, we can regard the rate of back-reaction as negligible compared to the adsorption rate. The rate eqn (2) can thus be rewritten in the form of rate r′: r′ = kD[S][TiO2] = k′D[TiO2](3)where the concentration of S, which can be considered constant, is grouped with the rate constant kD, obtaining an effective constant k′D = kD[S]. The second-order rate equation has been thus reduced to a pseudo-first order rate equation and k′D is its pseudo-first order rate constant. The sum of the concentrations of the free adsorption sites [TiO2] and dye-coated adsorption sites [S:TiO2] is constant over the whole adsorption process, and can be described by eqn (4), where [TiO2]t=0 is the number of the active sites at the beginning of the adsorption process, and [S:TiO2]t=∞ is the number of the dye-coated sites at the saturation level: [TiO2] + [S:TiO2] = [TiO2]t=0 = [S:TiO2]t=∞(4)
Here we assume, for the sake of simplicity, that all of the active sites of TiO2 will be coated by molecules of the sensitizer at the saturation level, so that eqn (2) can be rewritten as: r′ = −d([S:TiO2]t=∞ − [S:TiO2])/dt = k′D ([S:TiO2]t=∞ − [S:TiO2])(5)
In terms of the saturation ratio θ, defined as the ratio between the number of dye-coated adsorption sites at a specific dipping time, relative to the same value at the saturation level (where θ = 1, or 100%), eqn (5), involving the effective rate k′D can be rewritten as: r′ = −d(1 − θ)/dt = k′D(1 − θ)(6)from which, solving the differential equation, an expression for the time dependence of the saturation ratio θ(t) follows: (7)
The experimental values of the saturation ratio θ are listed in Table 1 and shown in Fig. 4 (filled squares), as calculated from the integrated absorption area of the dye-coated films in Fig. 2, at every specific dipping time, over the corresponding area at saturation (24 h). By fitting the values of θ in Table 1 with the exponential function in eqn (7), the value of the pseudo-first order rate constant k′D = (3.1 ± 0.2) × 10−4 s−1 is obtained. The fit is excellent, with mean square deviation of about 0.99 (see Fig. 4, solid line), so that we can conclude that the whole adsorption process follows a simple pseudo-first order kinetics, properly described by the relationship (7) in terms of saturation ratio θ and effective rate constant k′D. The observed rate change vs. dipping time, clearly visible in Fig. 4, is therefore just the effect of an exponential rate law. For comparison, Fig. 4 reports the values of the amount of dye measured after desorption from each of the samples (open squares), as also listed in Table 1, and the best fit with eqn (7) (dashed line). The fitting procedure gives k′D = (5 ± 1) × 10−4 s−1, with a good standard deviation of 0.94, confirming that the adsorption process follows a pseudo-first order kinetics, though with a different rate constant (again of the same order as that obtained from the film spectra). Nonetheless, it should be noted that a higher scattering of the data from the desorbed solutions (clearly because of their very low concentration) makes the fitting slightly worse and the uncertainty on the k′D value somewhat higher. This means that the most reliable method for studying the adsorption kinetics is analysing the film spectra by the procedure proposed above. The overall sizable matching between data of dye-adsorbed films and dye-desorbed solutions (Fig. 4) assures reciprocal validation of data. The absolute amounts of desorbed dye, and thus amounts of dye adsorbed onto TiO2 at different dipping times, are therefore validated and are fully reliable (within about 5 × 10−9 mol cm−2 for the specific dye investigated here).

The inset shows the enlargement of the 0–6 h dipping time range. 
The results about kinetics extracted from Fig. 4 are in contrast with recent kinetic studies7 where the adsorption of N719 on TiO2 was described by a two-step process, a first rapid growth followed by slow adsorption, each one characterized by a different kinetic relationship, even if it seems difficult to link two different constants to two processes with different mechanisms and rates of dye adsorption. Indeed, the first step was modeled by a pseudo-first order kinetic process and the obtained constant (k′D = 3 × 10−4 s−1) is in excellent agreement with our findings. In a second kinetic study,6 where adsorption kinetics were studied only up to the first 4 h of dipping time, a pseudo-first order model was similarly proposed, although in that case the obtained kinetic constant (k′D = 1.6 × 10−3 s−1) was slightly different from our and Concina's7 values, likely due to the narrower investigated range of contact times.
Conclusions
We have presented a spectroscopic quantitative method for the investigation of the dye-sensitizer uptake into TiO2 films for application in DSCs. The UV-Vis spectra of the dye-coated films have been measured and analyzed as a function of the dipping time of the FTO/TiO2 substrate into the dye solution, from few seconds to 24 h. In particular, we show for the first time that the main absorption bands display a red shift observed for dipping times longer than 10 min, likely ascribed to aggregation phenomena. Because of these findings, a new, more reliable, method for determining the relative absorption intensity of the dye-coated films has been proposed, based either on the integration of the whole absorption spectrum in the Vis range or on the evaluation of the area of the most significant low-energy MLCT peak, after spectrum deconvolution. Both approaches led to the same conclusions identifying two main temporal regions, one at shorter dipping times (up to 1 h), characterized by a steep increase of the dye loading, and another at longer contact times, up to 24 h, where the increment of the dye uptake is much slower. Nonetheless, the whole adsorption process, from few seconds up to 24 h dipping time, is very nicely described by a simple pseudo-first order kinetic model, with a rate constant of 3.1 × 10−4 s−1. Therefore, the presence of two temporal regions is simply the consequence of the exponential kinetic law. Our findings clearly evidenced that the first minutes (up to 1 h dipping time) are strategic for an effective uptake of the dye by the TiO2 nanoparticles, with a saturation level reached within the first 5 h. These results matched well with those of previous studies,13 when considering the different TiO2 thicknesses and dye solution concentrations used here. This result is in contrast with the commonly used procedure for dye uptake of Ru(II) DSC sensitizers, which implies typical dipping times of 16 to 24 h. We have demonstrated that not only longer dipping times are almost useless for significantly increasing the dye loading into the semiconductor film, but also that dye aggregation is likely to occur upon increasing the contact time, a process which might negatively affect the photovoltaic response of the photoanode due to self-quenching of the dye excited state.2 We believe that these results can be strategically exploited for optimizing DSC industrial fabrication protocols where shorter dipping times, or even continuous flow conditions, at no expense of device efficiency, are crucial for setting up low-cost fast automated procedures.
As a general conclusion, the reliability of the herein proposed spectroscopic data treatment with respect to previous works permits to consider findings in Table 1 as a tool for fast determination of the uptaken N719 dye in TiO2 films, even by using well assessed experimental methods. In general, similar tables could be built for any alternative dye–TiO2 photoanode pair. In particular, by setting the proper modifications, the described protocol can be extended to the investigation of organic dyes as well, where a larger variety of dipping times for the optimal dye adsorption on the TiO2 film (from 3–4 h to a few days, as in the case of the 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene-dithienosilole21 and 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene-thienothiophene22 record organic dyes, respectively) have been reported. This suggests that complex aggregation and adsorption equilibria take place, often further complicated by the presence of variable amounts of chenodeoxycholic acid as a de-aggregating co-adsorbent agent. These phenomena require a systematic investigation, which is presently being analyzed in detail and will be presented in a forthcoming paper.
