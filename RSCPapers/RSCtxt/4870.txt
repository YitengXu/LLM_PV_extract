    , Accepted 7th July 2022First published on 7th July 2022AbstractThe construction of a powerful molecular interlayer is beneficial to the enhancement of both efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells. We herein disclose that low-cost trifluorothymine with Lewis acid (protons of NH) and base (carbonyl oxygens) sites as well as hydrophobic moiety (trifluoromethyl) can be exploited as a robust molecular passivator for organic–inorganic hybrid lead iodide based perovskites. The lead and iodine promoted self-organization of amphiphilic trifluorothymine molecules can not only remove some electron and hole traps on the surface of perovskite and attenuate interfacial charge recombination, but also markedly reduce the thermal decomposition of hybrid perovskites and control the cracks of organic hole transport layers. Perovskite solar cells with a trifluorothymine interlayer maintain about 90% of initial efficiency after 1000 h aging at 85 °C. We demonstrate that the judicious combination of a potent trifluorothymine interlayer with a high glass transition temperature organic hole transport layer, a triple-cation lead iodide based perovskite, and an oxide electron transport layer is a practical strategy for the fabrication of efficient and durable perovskite solar cells.
Introduction
Controlling the interfacial charge transfers of the light absorption layer with charge transport layers has a great influence on the photovoltaic parameters of perovskite solar cells (PSCs).1–8 For cells with titania as the electron transport layer, the rate of electron injection from photoexcited perovskite is not fast enough, due to the relatively small driving force. Therefore, the rate of injecting holes into the hole transport layer must be sufficiently swift to ensure high-yield charge separation. From another point of view, in order to obtain a high photovoltage, the recombination of the separated electrons and holes at the interface must be as slow as possible. To reduce the rate of charge recombination but not to decrease the yield of hole injection, it is desirable to construct a delicate molecular interlayer between the perovskite layer and the hole transport layer.
Furthermore, the photovoltage of PSC is also impacted by the nonradiative recombination of photoexcited perovskite,9–11 which is intrinsically related to the bulk and surface defects.12–15 Bulk defects are usually associated with the interruptions of regular patterns in crystalline solids, including vacancy defects, interstitial defects, antisite defects, etc.16–20 Vacancy defects are shallow while interstitial and antisite defects are deep or shallow.16,17 Carriers trapped by shallow defects are likely to have been thermally released to the bands before the occurrence of recombination. Meanwhile, carriers trapped by deep defects are hard to escape. However the number of deep defects is small because of the relatively high formation energy.14,21,22 On the surface of solution-deposited polycrystalline perovskite films, when atoms with a specific electronic structure are replaced by other atoms, surface defects are formed.15,22–24 The density of carrier traps at the interface of the polycrystalline film is reported to be several orders of magnitudes larger than that in high-quality single crystals.25 Nonradiative recombination can be severely induced by interfacial defects. In this context, a variety of molecular passivators with Lewis acid26 or base27,28 sites or both29,30 have been tested for the reduction of surface defects of perovskite films.
As a matter of fact, it is a challenging task to identify a molecular passivator which under the stresses of heat, light, bias and water can attenuate the generation of new defects and the decomposition of perovskite thin films. In this paper, we unravel that a triple-cation lead iodide based perovskite film can induce trifluorothymine (TFT) molecules to self-organize into a more hydrophobic layer, which can not only ameliorate the efficiency but also enhance the 85 °C stability of PSCs. TFT is a commercially available compound at a low price, with a melting point of 245 °C.
Results and discussion
Here we picked up a relatively stable thin film of triple-cation lead halide based perovskite reported by Saliba et al.31 as the light absorption layer for solar cells although it is not suitable for the most efficient PSCs now.32 Its chemical formula can be written as (CsPbI3)0.05(MAPbBr3)0.075(FAPbI3)0.875(PbI2)0.03 wherein MA and FA are methylammonium and formamidinium, respectively, which is further abbreviated as CsMAFA. As shown in Fig. 1a, although the about 47° contact angle of a water droplet on the CsMAFA film does not decrease significantly within 3 s, polarized optical microscopy (POM) imaging reveals that the CsMAFA film in contact with liquid water is already decomposed. Meanwhile, the decomposition rate of TFT-modified perovskite in contact with liquid water is appreciably slowed down (Fig. 1b), perhaps due to an enlarged water contact angle beyond 68°. The latter point is out of expectation since the water contact angle on the TFT-coated glass (Fig. S1, ESI†) is actually less than 35°, on account of the amphiphilic character of TFT molecules. It is likely that TFT molecules may interact with the lead and iodine constituents of CsMAFA, forming a self-organized molecular layer with the hydrophobic trifluoromethyl group exposed on the surface.
 Fig. 1  Temporal evolutions of the water contact angle (θ) and polarized optical microscopy (POM) image upon dripping a water droplet on different samples: (a) perovskite on glass; (b) TFT-modified perovskite on glass; (c) HTL-covered perovskite on glass; (d) HTL-covered, TFT-modified perovskite on glass. The size of the POM image is 400 μm × 200 μm. 
In the subsequent experiments, we deposited a hole transport layer (HTL) on the top of the CsMAFA film without or with TFT modification, and measured the water contact angles being comparable (Fig. 1c and d). The HTL is composed of molecular semiconductor T5H-BMCA and air-doping promoter 4-tert-butylpyridinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (BPTFSI) at a weight ratio of 85:15,33 and their chemical structures are shown in Fig. S2.† Within 20 s, the contact angles do not decrease remarkably for both samples. However even in the presence of an about 60 nm-thick HTL, more and more micron-sized particles with birefringence are generated beneath the water droplet. It appears that water molecules have gradually penetrated through the HTL and solvated CsMAFA, resulting in the formation of PbI2 crystallites. Notably, the sample with the TFT interlayer decomposes more slowly than the control without TFT. Obviously, the HTL and TFT can act as dual fences to slow down the water-induced decomposition of perovskites.
It is further found from ATR-FTIR measurements that the CO stretching vibration absorption peak appears at 1664 cm−1 for TFT on CsMAFA, in contrast to 1672 cm−1 for TFT on glass (Fig. 2a), which indicates that the Lewis base sites, carbonyl oxygens, coordinate with lead on the surface of perovskite crystallites. This reasoning is further corroborated by recording the 0.2 eV shift of Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 peaks to low binding energies (Fig. 2b and c). In contrast, the surface modification of CsMAFA with TFT induces a 0.3 eV shift of I 3d5/2 and I 3d3/2 peaks to high binding energies, which suggests that the Lewis acid sites, protons of NH in TFT, interact with iodine on the surface of perovskite. However, as shown by Fig. S3,† neither the optical density nor the optical bandgap of the CsMAFA film changes with TFT modification. Moreover, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns shown in Fig. S4† suggest that TFT neither induces the formation of new phases nor affects the crystallinity of the perovskite film. Note from ATR-FTIR measurements (Fig. S5†) that the TFT layer on perovskite is hardly washed off by chlorobenzene, which is likely related to the large adsorption/desorption equilibrium constant, owing to both the strong bonding of TFT to perovskite and the weak interaction of TFT with chlorobenzene.

On the basis of density functional theoretical calculation at the level of GGA:revPBE-D3, we obtained the top-4 strongest adsorption modes of TFT on the surface of PbI2-terminated perovskite, as presented in Fig. 2d. The CO⋯Pb interactions are shown as modes 1 and 2, and NH⋯I interactions as modes 3 and 4. In modes 1 and 2, the bond lengths between carbon and oxygen are elongated compared to those in free TFT, which is in accord with the shift of the CO peak to lower wavenumbers. Moreover, we further calculated the interaction energies (Eint) by periodic energy decomposition analysis, being −0.80 eV for mode 1, −0.73 eV for mode 2, −0.46 eV for mode 3, and −0.36 eV for mode 4. Apparently, TFT molecules adsorbed on perovskite in mode 1 with the largest Eint can make the hydrophobic trifluoromethyl group left on the surface of the self-organized molecular layer.
As Fig. S6† shows, the surface modification of CsMAFA with TFT increases the intensity of the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectrum by 56%, without affecting the peak position and full width at half maximum. The CsMAFA film deposited on an alumina substrate (Fig. 3a) presents a biexponential PL decay upon excitation of picosecond laser pulses, with an amplitude-averaged lifetime (PL) of approximately 1.21 μs (Fig. 3b). Moreover, the PL of the TFT-modified CsMAFA film is longer being 1.75 μs, which should be associated with the elimination of some nonradiative recombination centers. After 1000 h storage under ambient conditions, the TFT-modified CsMAFA film (without encapsulation) still possesses a PL as long as 1.56 μs compared to 0.88 μs for the control.

For the 85 °C aging, the perovskite sample was encapsulated with an inert PVK layer, gold layer, waterproof polyimide adhesive tape, and epoxy resin. For the PL monitoring of the degradation of perovskite, mesoporous Al2O3 is used as the substrate for perovskite deposition and PVK is used as the protective layer for perovskite. Neither Al2O3 nor PVK will extract charges from the photoexcited perovskite. The overall architecture for PL monitoring mimics the real PSC, but does not have the function of producing electricity. (b and d) PL lifetimes of perovskite samples before and after (b) room temperature and (d) 85 °C aging. (e and f) Current–voltage curves for (e) the electron-only device and (f) the hole-only device. The insets show the device structures. Three regions can be identified, including the ohmic region, the trap-filled limited region, and the SCLC region. The trap-filled limited voltages (VTFL) are also derived. 
To conduct a preliminary evaluation of the heat resistance of perovskite films at 85 °C, we sequentially deposited a poly(9-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) layer and a gold layer on the above samples and encapsulated them with polyimide tape and epoxy resin (Fig. 3c). Note that the PVK protective layer cannot extract holes from the herein used perovskite, because of relatively deep highest occupied molecular orbital energy level (−5.8 eV). Actually, the change of PVK to other polymers such as polymethyl methacrylate does not alter the PL decay traces of fresh perovskite films, as presented in Fig. S8b.† In view of the high glass transition temperature (over 200 °C) of PVK comparable to the herein selected hole transport material T5H-BMCA, we used PVK as an inert control for a further aging test. After 1000 h thermal aging, the PL of the sample with TFT is 1.48 μs, which is encouragingly longer than 0.74 μs of the unmodified control (Fig. 3d). It can be therefore concluded that the surface modification of perovskites with TFT evidently improves the excited state properties of both fresh and aged films.
To assess the influence of TFT modification on the density of trap states (nt) in perovskite films, we fabricated electron-only and hole-only devices. For the device schematics, see Fig. 3e and f. Overall, the logarithmic plot of current versus voltage in the range of 0 to 3 V recorded in the dark can be divided into three regions including the ohmic one, the trap-filled-limited (TFL) one, and the space-charge-limited current one. From the linear fittings in the ohmic and TFL regions, we can derive the TFL voltage (VTFL), which is related to nt by nt = 2εε0VTFL/(eL2), where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity (ε0 = 8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), e is the elementary charge (e = 1.6 × 10−19 C), L is the thickness of the CsMAFA film (L ≈ 500 nm), and ε is the relative permittivity of CsMAFA. The characteristics of ε as a function of frequency are shown in Fig. S9† for the CsMAFA film without and with TFT, yielding an almost identical ε value of 27.85 ± 0.05. It turns out that surface modification with TFT reduces not only the VTFL of electron-only devices by 20 mV, but also that of hole-only ones by 62 mV. For the control and TFT-modified samples, the calculated nt of electrons is 2.13 × 1015 cm−3 and 1.87 × 1015 cm−3, and the nt of holes is 3.30 × 1015 cm−3 and 2.53 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. The reduction of perovskite traps for both electrons and holes via TFT modification can slow down the trap-assisted charge recombination, as already embodied in PL measurements.
Next, we fabricated n-i-p typed PSCs with the device architecture of FTO/TiO2/CsMAFA/HTL/Au. The details of device fabrication and measurements are given in the Experimental section of the ESI.† The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of fresh PSCs were recorded under the illumination of AM1.5G simulated sunlight at 100 mW cm−2. By comparing the J–V curves of forward and reverse scans shown in Fig. S10,† it can be seen that the electrical hysteresis of the cell is very small with or without the TFT interlayer. In addition, the distribution of photovoltaic parameters is fairly narrow, as shown in Fig. S11.† Representative reverse scan J–V characteristics are plotted in Fig. 4a, and photovoltaic parameters such as short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit photovoltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (PCE) are listed in Table 1. A typical PSC with a TFT interlayer exhibits a JSC of 24.5 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.150 V, and an FF of 0.782, giving rise to a PCE of 22.0%, which is higher than 20.7% of the control cell without TFT (JSC = 24.5 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.120 V, and FF = 0.755). Combining the standard AM1.5G solar spectrum (Fig. S12†) and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum (Fig. 4b), one can forecast the photocurrent density of the solar cell under AM1.5G conditions (JEQESC). It turns out that the JEQESC of PSCs with and without TFT is around 24.0 mA cm−2, which is in good agreement with the JSC derived from J–V measurements. To elucidate whether the TFT interlayer affects the built-in voltage (Vbi) and interfacial charge density (N) of PSCs, we further measured the capacitance (C) in a range of bias potentials (V) and plotted C−2 as a function of V in Fig. 4c, and the cell with TFT displays a larger Vbi than the control cell, which is consistent with the trend of VOC. A reduction of N from 3.3 × 1016 cm−3 to 2.4 × 1016 cm−3 is further noted upon introducing the TFT interlayer. The improved FF and VOC with the TFT interlayer can be accounted for by the approximately two times increased interface recombination resistance (Rre, Fig. 4d) derived from impedance measurement.34,35 Meanwhile, it can be concluded from Fig. 4e that the modification of TFT has a negligible influence on transport resistance (Rtr).

The operational stability was first tested by tracking the maximum power point under the continuous illumination of a one-sun-equivalent light-emitting diode array. After 500 h light-soaking at 60 °C, the PSC with TFT retains 88% of its initial PCE, which is much better than 62% of the control cell (Fig. S13†). Next, we submitted the cells to thermostability tests in an oven at 85 °C. For a clear comparison with fresh cells, the J–V curves of cells after thermal aging for 1000 h are also plotted in Fig. 4a, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are also summarized in Table 1. Encouragingly, the aged cell with TFT still exhibits a PCE of 19.7%, with a retention rate of 90%, which is significantly higher than 69% of the counterpart without TFT, and also higher than those with some reported36–39 (Table S3†) and related interlayers, as presented in Fig. 4f. Moreover, for the cell without TFT, 1000 h of aging gives rise to decreases in FF by 15.8%, in JSC by 13.1%, and in VOC by 5.8%. In comparison, the decay rates of FF, JSC, and VOC were all lower for the cell with TFT, at 6.0%, 3.7%, and 1.3%, respectively. As shown in Tables S4–S7,† the positive influence of the TFT interlayer on efficiency and stability can also be observed when the BPTFSI-containing composite of spiro-OMeTAD or PTAA is used as the hole transport layer, or perovskite films with different compositions are used as the light-absorption layers.
Moreover, there is a good linear relationship between JSC and JEQESC for the fresh and aged cells as Fig. S14† shows. As shown in Fig. 4b, thermal aging brings forth a decrease in the EQE maximum, from 93% to 79% for the cell without TFT and from 93% to 89% for the cell with TFT. After aging there is a reduction in Vbi, being 88 mV for the cell without TFT and 32 mV for the cell with TFT, which is in line with the aging-induced variation of VOC. Meanwhile, the N value of the aged cell becomes higher, suggesting an increase of interfacial defects. However, the extent of N change is smaller for the cell with TFT. In general, the thermal aging brings forth a reduction of Rre (Fig. 4d) and an enlargement of Rtr (Fig. 4e). The diminished Rre indicates accelerated charge recombination, which plays a dominant role in the VOC drop. The decrease in Rre also contributes to the drop in FF, together with the increase in Rtr. It is worth noting that the degrees of Rre and Rtr variation are significantly attenuated for the TFT-modified cell. It is also worth noting from Fig. 4g that thermal aging leads to the prolongation of the PL of PSCs, which is in stark contrast to the shortening of PL of CsMAFA that is not in contact with charge extraction layers (Fig. 3d). Nevertheless, when TFT is present, PL changes to a lesser extent. It can be reasoned that the perovskite layer might degrade from the surface under thermal stress, creating more deep traps that promote nonradiative charge recombination. On the other hand, more wide-bandgap species generated by surface degradation of perovskite hinder hole injection more severely. Obviously, the existence of TFT can suppress the decrease of the charge separation yield, which is intrinsically linked with the EQE variation.
Subsequently, we cautiously made the encapsulant and gold electrode be exfoliated for further characterization. Electronic absorption spectroscopy measurements (Fig. 5a) show that with or without TFT, fresh cells have little difference in optical density at each wavelength. After 1000 h of thermal aging, the optical density of both cells decreases to some extent, and the decrease is smaller for the cell with TFT modification. We remark that restraining the degradation of the light-harvesting yield is vital for the long-term application of PSCs, although the extent of degradation observed here does not play a decisive role in the decrease of EQE maximum. As presented in Fig. 5b, the signal centered at 2θ = 14.0° can be ascribed to the X-ray diffraction of the (110) crystal plane of perovskite, and the peak at 2θ = 12.7° is related to the (001) diffraction of PbI2. Note that a small excess of PbI2 in the fresh cells is intentionally added during the perovskite deposition. Moreover, the aging-induced increments of PbI2 are ca. 6.5 times for the cell without TFT and ca. 1.6 times for the cell with TFT.

(d–g) Top-view SEM images of fresh and aged PSCs. The sealing materials and gold electrodes were exfoliated before measurements. (h–k) Top-view SEM images. (l–o) FOM images in the reflection mode. The HTLs were further washed away before measurements in panels (h–o). 
We further employed time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) to detect the distribution of iodide in the HTL. No significant difference is observed for the fresh cells with and without TFT (Fig. 5c). The iodide signals in the HTL are increased for the aged cells, suggesting the occurrence of iodide diffusion from perovskite into the HTL. However, the diffusion of iodide has been restrained to some extent by the presence of the TFT interlayer. Next, we scrutinized whether the morphology of the HTL deteriorated after aging at 85 °C for 1000 h by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging. As a matter of fact, for fresh PSCs made with and without the TFT interlayer, no obvious difference can be perceived from Fig. 5d and e, where the polycrystalline structure of the CsFAMA film is dimly seen, owing to the filter effect of the HTL on secondary electrons. For the aged cell without TFT, clear textures along with some submicron-sized voids appear in the HTL (Fig. 5f).
In contrast, the aged cell with the TFT interlayer remains largely intact (Fig. 5g), although the polycrystalline structure of the perovskite can be more clearly observed. The significant difference in the thermally induced HTL morphology indicates the need for a robust interlayer to avoid the destruction of the HTL by perovskite decomposition products. It can be reckoned that thermally induced pinholes in the HTL will lead to the decrease of hole extraction rate and hole conduction and even lead to direct micro-contact between perovskite and gold in severe cases, resulting in solar cell failure.
Finally, we used chlorobenzene to wash away the HTL from the surface of perovskite. As shown in Fig. 5h and i, the fine perovskite grains are tightly packed together, producing a nice polycrystalline film for the fresh cells. In addition, no discernable features can be observed from fluorescence optical microscopy (FOM) images (Fig. 5l and m). However, some submicron-sized grain-boundary voids are apparent in the SEM image of the perovskite film in the aged cell without TFT (Fig. 5j), and a high proportion of crystals has undergone serious decomposition or corrosion at the surface. Meanwhile, from the FOM image in Fig. 5n one can observe many dot- and needle-shaped green patterns, which can be caused by the direct bandgap emission of PbI2. For the aged cell with TFT, there are much fewer voids at the grain boundaries (Fig. 5k), with fewer and smaller PbI2 patterns (Fig. 5o).
Under long-term 85 °C thermal stress, the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite layer used in this work can slowly decompose and produce extra PbI2 as well as some volatile species such as CH3I, especially in the presence of ambient moisture. As revealed by electronic absorption, XRD, TOF-SIMS, SEM, and FOM measurements, the TFT interlayer can effectively attenuate the decomposition of hybrid perovskite. Moreover, SEM measurements show that the TFT layer can control the cracks of the organic hole transport layer, due to the reduced perovskite decomposition and/or the enhanced interfacial interaction between the HTL and TFT. The positive effects brought about by the TFT interlayer contribute to the enhanced thermal stability of PSCs.
Conclusions
In summary, we have identified an effective molecular passivator, TFT, which can self-organize on the surface of lead iodide based perovskites via CO⋯Pb and NH⋯I interactions. The TFT interlayer can attenuate the interfacial charge recombination and the thermal decomposition of hybrid perovskite, contributing to enhanced efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells. Moreover, it is revealed that the alleviation of perovskite decomposition by introducing a robust interlayer is helpful for the maintenance of the morphology of the hole transport layer. The TFT-modified solar cell has achieved a good retention of photovoltaic parameters after 1000 h aging at 85 °C.

 	Fig. 1  Temporal evolutions of the water contact angle (θ) and polarized optical microscopy (POM) image upon dripping a water droplet on different samples: (a) perovskite on glass; (b) TFT-modified perovskite on glass; (c) HTL-covered perovskite on glass; (d) HTL-covered, TFT-modified perovskite on glass. The size of the POM image is 400 μm × 200 μm.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) ATR-FTIR spectra. (b and c) X-ray photoelectron spectra: (b) Pb 4f and (c) I 3d. (d) The structure of TFT and the top-4 strongest adsorption modes of TFT on the surface of a PbI2-terminated FAPbI3 slab. The bond lengths of CO are also marked.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a and c) The architectures of perovskite samples used for aging tests with 40% environmental humidity at (a) room temperature and (c) 85 °C. The aging time is 1000 h. For the 85 °C aging, the perovskite sample was encapsulated with an inert PVK layer, gold layer, waterproof polyimide adhesive tape, and epoxy resin. For the PL monitoring of the degradation of perovskite, mesoporous Al2O3 is used as the substrate for perovskite deposition and PVK is used as the protective layer for perovskite. Neither Al2O3 nor PVK will extract charges from the photoexcited perovskite. The overall architecture for PL monitoring mimics the real PSC, but does not have the function of producing electricity. (b and d) PL lifetimes of perovskite samples before and after (b) room temperature and (d) 85 °C aging. (e and f) Current–voltage curves for (e) the electron-only device and (f) the hole-only device. The insets show the device structures. Three regions can be identified, including the ohmic region, the trap-filled limited region, and the SCLC region. The trap-filled limited voltages (VTFL) are also derived.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of fresh and aged cells under irradiation of AM1.5G simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2). Thermal aging was carried out for 1000 h at 85 °C with an environmental relative humidity of ca. 40%. (b) External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra. (c) Mott–Schottky plots of the reciprocal of the square of capacitance (C−2) as a function of voltage (V). (d) Charge recombination resistance (Rre) plotted as a function of V. (e) Transport resistance (Rtr) plotted as a function of V. (f) Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of fresh cells (filled symbols) and 1000 h, 85 °C aged cells (open symbols) without and with different interlayers. PEAI: phenethylammonium iodide; FEAI: pentafluorophenylethylammonium iodide; CFPEAI: 4-trifluoromethyl phenethylammonium iodide. (g) Photoluminescence (PL) intensity plotted as a function of time (t). The black lines refer to biexponential fittings.
