PDFCDTBT possesses a band gap of 1.75 eV, a low-lying HOMO energy level of −5.23 eV, and a good thermal and electrochemical stability. In comparison with the corresponding non-fluoro substituted HXS-1, which has a HOMO energy level of 5.21 eV, a LUMO energy level of 3.35 eV, and an optical band gap of 1.86 eV, the incorporation of two fluoro atoms in the carbazole donor unit lowers the HOMO and the LUMO energy levels of the polymer, which results in simultaneously decreasing the band gap of the polymer and increasing the Voc of polymer solar cells. The fluoro-containing polymer PDFCDTBT also shows strong intramolecular interactions and forms close packing in the solid state. Polymer solar cells based on PDFCDTBT and (6,6)-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) demonstrate a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.8% with a Voc of 0.91 V, a Jsc of 9.5 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.55. In comparison with HXS-1, the better stability, higher Voc, and narrower band gap indicate that PDFCDTBT is a very promising donor material for high efficiency polymer solar cells.IntroductionAs a method to use clean and renewable solar energy, bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells based on composites of electron-donating conjugated polymers (donor) and electron-accepting fullerene derivatives (acceptor) have been paid considerable attention for their obvious advantages over traditional silicon-based solar cells, such as low cost, light weight, and high-throughput manufacture.1 (6,6)-Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and (6,6)-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) are commonly used acceptor materials and medium and low band gap conjugated polymers are commonly used donor materials.2 Great effort has been devoted to developing novel polymer donor materials,2f,3 interfacial materials,4 and device structures.5 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) for polymer solar cells has been increased to around 10%.6To fully exploit the solar energy, the absorption spectra of conjugated polymers need to cover a wider scope of the terrestrial solar spectrum in order to harvest as much sunlight as possible to convert into Jsc.7 Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop conjugated polymers with a broader absorption through decreasing their optical band gap. An effective strategy in designing low band gap conjugated polymers is to alternate an electron-rich donor (D) unit and an electron-deficient acceptor (A) unit in the same conjugated polymer backbone.8 In the past several years, we have made a great effort to develop new low band gap polymer materials for high efficiency polymer solar cells.9 In 2009, we have reported the design and synthesis of a planar narrow band gap conjugated polymer HXS-1 for high efficiency polymer solar cells, and a PCE of 5.4% has been achieved.9a,10HXS-1 has a HOMO energy level of 5.21 eV, a LUMO energy level of 3.35 eV, and an optical band gap of 1.86 eV. Considering the ideal HOMO and LUMO energy levels of a polymer donor are around 3.9 eV and 5.4 eV, respectively,11 it would be of great importance to lower the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of HXS-1. Lowering the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of HXS-1 will lead to a narrower band gap and higher open-circuit voltage (Voc). Voc and short-circuit current (Jsc) are two most important parameters that determine the PCEs of PSCs. Recently, high efficiency donor polymers based on fluoro containing narrow band gap polymers have been reported by several groups.12 In comparison with the corresponding non-fluoro substituted ones, the fluoro containing narrow band gap conjugated polymers exhibited deeper HOMO and LUMO energy levels. It is worth noting that almost for all reported fluoro containing high efficiency polymers the fluoro atoms are located at the acceptor unit except one example reported by Yu et al.12c–f According to the hybrid orbital theory and molecular orbital theory, the polymers' HOMO energy level should also be largely affected by the HOMO level of the donor unit.13 Herein we report the design and synthesis of a D–A alternating conjugated polymer (PDFCDTBT) with 3,6-difluorocarbazole as the fluoro substituted donor unit. The chemical structures of HXS-1 and PDFCDTBT are shown in Chart 1. Due to the S–O supramolecular interaction, the two alkoxy chains on the benzothiadiazole unit can simultaneously increase the planarity and solubility of polymers.14 As expected, the fluorinated polymer PDFCDTBT exhibits markedly lower HOMO and LUMO energy levels, forms closed packing in the solid state, and shows higher thermal and electrochemical stability. Polymer solar cells with the blend of PDFCDTBT/PC71BM (1:1.8) as the active layer showed a PCE of 4.8% under simulated solar illumination of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that 3,6-difluorocarbazole can be a useful donor unit to construct narrow band gap conjugated polymers. Chart 1  Chemical structures of HXS-1 and PDFCDTTBT. Experimental sectionMaterials and instrumentsUnless otherwise noted, all chemicals were purchased from commercial suppliers without further purification. Solvents were dried using standard procedures. The catalyst precursor Pd(PPh3)4 was prepared according to the literature15 and stored in a Schlenk tube under nitrogen. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and diethyl ether were distilled from sodium with benzophenone as an indicator under a nitrogen atmosphere. Hexane and dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) were distilled from CaH2. Chloroform (CF) was distilled before use. All reactions were performed under an atmosphere of nitrogen and monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC) on silica gel 60 F254 (Merck, 0.2 mm). Column chromatography was carried out on silica gel (200–300 mesh). 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DM 300 or AV 400 spectrometer in CDCl3 or 1,2-dichlorobenzene-D4. UV-vis absorption spectra were obtained on a PerkinElmer Lambda 750 UV/VIS/NIR Spectrometer. Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Horiba Scientific FluoroMax-4 spectrofluorometer. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectra were performed on Bruker BIFLEXIII. Elemental analyses were performed on a Flash EA 1112 analyzer. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed on a TA2100 and Perkin-Elmer Diamond DSC instrument, respectively, under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 to record the TGA and DSC curves. The gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurements were performed at 150 °C on a PL-220 (Polymer Laboratories) chromatograph connected to a differential refractometer with 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB) as an eluent. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed under ambient conditions using a Digital Instrument Multimode Nanoscope IIIA operating in the tapping mode. The thickness was determined by a Dektak 150 surface profilometer. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected using a PANalytical X′ Pert PRO MPD diffractometer with Cu KR radiation. The electrochemical behavior of PDFCDTBT was investigated by using cyclic voltammetry (CHI 630A Electrochemical Analyzer) with a standard three-electrode electrochemical cell in a 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate solution in CH3CN at room temperature at atmosphere with a scanning rate of 0.1 V s−1. A glassy carbon working electrode, a Pt wire counter electrode, and an Ag/AgNO3 (0.01 M in CH3CN) reference electrode were used. The experiments were calibrated with the standard ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc) redox system and an assumption that the energy level of Fc is 4.8 eV below vacuum.16Synthesis of 3,6-difluoro-9-octyl-2,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-9H-carbazole (M2)A mixture of 2,7-dibromo-3,6-difluoro-9-octyl-9H-carbazole (6) (0.30 g, 0.63 mmol), bis(pinacolato)diboron (0.40 g, 1.58 mmol), PdCl2(dppf) (25.9 mg, 0.03 mmol), potassium acetate (0.37 g, 3.8 mmol) in dry N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (20 mL) was stirred at 80 °C for 3 d. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature, water (200 mL) was added, the aqueous layer was extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 100 mL), and the combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, and evaporated to dryness. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (SiO2, petroleum ether (60–90 °C):ethyl acetate = 4:1 by volume) and recrystallization from petroleum ether to afford M2 as a white crystal (162 mg, 45%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ 7.72–7.71 (d, 2H), 7.66–7.64 (d, 2H), 4.35–4.32 (t, 2H), 1.88–1.85 (m, 2H), 1.41 (s, 24H), 1.36–1.26 (m, 10H), 0.88–0.85 (t, 3H). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3) δ 162.20, 159.80, 137.87, 125.31, 125.27, 125.21, 125.17, 116.41, 116.31, 106.38, 106.11, 83.91, 43.14, 31.76, 29.22, 29.13, 29.05, 27.01, 24.86, 22.59, 14.05.

Anal. calcd for C32H45B2F2NO4: C 67.75, H 7.99, N 2.47; found: C 68.09, H 7.35, N 2.32%.Synthesis of poly[3,6-difluoro-9-octyl-9H-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-5′,6′-bis(octyloxy)-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PDFCDTBT)A mixture of M1 (200 mg, 0.28 mmol) and M2 (159 mg, 0.28 mmol), THF (45 mL), toluene (15 mL), H2O (4 mL), and NaHCO3 (0.4 g, 4.8 mmol) was carefully degassed before and after Pd(PPh3)4 (3.6 mg, 3.2 μmol) was added. The mixture was stirred and refluxed under nitrogen for 3 d. Phenylboronic acid (10 mg) and Pd(PPh3)4 (1.8 mg, 1.6 μmol) were added, the reaction mixture was refluxed for 4 h to block the bromo endgroups, bromobenzene (100 μL) was added, and the reaction mixture was refluxed overnight to block the boronic endgroups. After being cooled to room temperature, water and chlorobenzene were then added and the organic layer was separated and washed three times with water. Then, the solution was heated to 100 °C to dissolve the polymers and filtered. After the removal of most of the solvent, the residue was poured into a large amount of acetone and the resulting precipitates were collected by filtration and washed with acetone. The crude product was again dissolved in a minimum amount of chlorobenzene, precipitated into a large amount of acetone, and the formed precipitates were collected by filtration and dried under high vacuum to afford PDFCDTBT as a dark red solid (220 mg, 91%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, 1,2-dichlorobenzene-D4) δ 8.97–8.79 (br, 2H), 7.93–7.67 (br, 6H), 4.39–4.27 (br, 6H), 2.28–0.92 (br, 45H); GPC (PS standards): Mw = 23.9 kg mol−1, Mn = 9.1 kg mol−1, and PDI = 2.64.Polymer solar cell fabrication and characterizationPolymer solar cells (PSCs) were fabricated with the device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/LiF/Al. The conductivity of ITO is 15 Ω □−1 and PEDOT:PSS is Baytron Al 4083 from H. C. Starck. The ITO glass was cleaned and a thin layer of PEDOT:PSS was spin coated at 3000 rpm s−1 and dried subsequently at 120 °C for 10 min in an oven, and then transferred to a glove box. The blend of PDFCDTBT and PC71BM was dissolved in different solvents and heated at 90 °C overnight to ensure sufficient dissolution, and then spun cast onto the PEDOT:PSS layer. The prepared films were kept in a vacuum chamber overnight before evaporating 0.4 nm LiF followed by 100 nm Al at a pressure of 1 × 10−6 mbar. Six cells were fabricated on one substrate with an effective area of 0.04 cm2. Current–voltage characteristics were recorded using a Keithley 236 Source Meter under illumination of AM 1.5G with intensity of 100 mW cm−2 from a solar simulator (model XES-301S, AAA, SAN-EI).Fabrication and characterization of organic field-effect transistors (OFETs)Top-contact devices were fabricated based on Si/SiO2 substrates (the back low resistance Si as gate, SiO2 (500 nm) with a capacitance of 7.5 nF cm−2 as gate insulator). The substrate of Si/SiO2 was sequentially cleaned with pure water, hot concentrated sulfuric acid–hydrogen peroxide solution (concentrated sulfuric acid:hydrogen peroxide (30%), 2:1, by volume), pure water, pure ethanol and pure acetone, successively, then treated with a monolayer of trichloro(octadecyl)silane (OTS) by the normal vapor deposition method described elsewhere.17 Polymer films were spin-coated on the OTS modified Si/SiO2 substrate from 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) with a polymer concentration of 7 mg mL−1. Electrodes of Au (25 nm) were vacuum deposited on films with width/length = 50 (channel width = 2.5 mm, channel length = 50 μm). J–V characteristics were obtained using a Keithley 4200 SCS with a Micromanipulator 6150 probe station in a clean and shielded box at room temperature in air. In order to confirm the reproducibility, about 10–20 transistors were examined at each condition.Results and discussionMaterial synthesisThe synthesis of PDFCDTBT is outlined in Scheme 1. Starting from commercially available 1,4-dibromo-2-fluorobenzene (1), its nitration with ammonium nitrate in the media of methylene chloride, trifluoroacetic acid, and trifluoroacetic anhydride (2:2:1, v/v) afforded 1,4-dibromo-2-fluoro-5-nitrobenzene (2).18 Ullmann coupling of 1,4-dibromo-2-fluoro-5-nitrobenzene (2) furnished 4,4′-dibromo-5,5′-difluoro-2,2′-dinitrobiphenyl (3) in 82% yield.19 The reduction of 3 with Sn/HCl/ethanol gave 4,4′-dibromo-5,5′-difluoro-biphenyl-2,2′-diamine (4) and the treatment of 4 with concentrated H3PO4 at 190 °C for 24 h furnished 2,7-dibromo-3,6-difluoro-9H-carbazole (5) in a total yield of 52%.20 The reaction of 5 and 1-bromooctane in THF with t-BuOK as the base afforded 2,7-dibromo-3,6-difluoro-9-octyl-9H-carbazole (6) in a yield of 89%. 2,7-Bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-3,6-difluoro-9-octyl-9H-carbazole (M2) was accomplished in a yield of 45% by Miyaura reaction of 6 and bis(pinacolato)diboron at 80 °C with PdCl2(dppf) as the catalyst precursor, potassium acetate as the base, and DMF as the solvent. The structure and purity of M2 were confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and combustion analysis. The synthesis of monomer M1 was reported in our previous paper.9a Suzuki–Miyaura polymerization of M1 and M2 was carried out in a biphasic mixture of THF–toluene (3:1) and aqueous NaHCO3 with Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst precursor. After polymerization for 72 hours, phenylboronic acid and then bromobenzene was consecutively added at a time interval of 4 hours to end cap the polymer. PDFCDTBT was obtained as a dark red solid in a yield of 91%. Although PDFCDTBT shows poor solubility in common organic solvents such as THF, CF, DCB, etc. at room temperature, it could be readily dissolved in chlorobenzene, DCB, TCB, etc. at elevated temperature, therefore its molecular weight and molecular weight distribution were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) at elevated temperature (150 °C) using TCB as an eluent calibrated with polystyrene standards. PDFCDTBT shows a number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 9.1 kg mol−1, a weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of 23.9 kg mol−1, and a polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.63. Scheme 1  Synthesis of PDFCDTBT. Optical propertiesThe normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of PDFCDTBT and HXS-1 in chlorobenzene and CF solutions at 20 °C are shown in Fig. 1a. In chlorobenzene solutions, both PDFCDTBT and HXS-1 show similar absorption spectra with two strong absorption peaks located at 383 and 517 nm. In CF solution, the absorption spectrum of HXS-1 completely overlaps with that in chlorobenzene; whereas in CF solution, the long wavelength absorption peak, which is originated from the internal charge transfer (ICT) of PDFCDTBT, red-shifted from 517 to 532 nm and an obvious absorption shoulder at 575 nm emerged, indicating the aggregation of PDFCDTBT molecules in CF solution. The film absorption spectra of PDFCDTBT and HXS-1 are shown in Fig. 1b. In comparison with their solution absorption ones, the absorption peaks of the films are markedly red-shifted and broader due to the aggregation of polymer chains in films. The optical absorption onset of the HXS-1 film is at 667 nm, corresponding to an optical band gap of 1.86 eV. The film absorption spectrum of PDFCDTBT is much broader than that of HXS-1 with an absorption onset of 709 nm, indicating that in the film the aggregation of PDFCDTBT is much stronger than that of HXS-1, and leads to an optical band gap of 1.75 eV. The close packing of PDFCDTBT in a film is also confirmed by XRD results (vide infra). The photoluminescence spectra of HXS-1 and PDFCDTBT in chlorobenzene solutions and in films with the excitation wavelength of 515 nm are shown in Fig. S1.† The emission spectra of HXS-1 and PDFCDTBT in CB solutions are almost superimposed with their corresponding film emission ones. It is worth noting that in both CB solutions and films the emission spectra of PDFCDTBT are red-shifted and narrowing in comparison with those of HXS-1. Fig. 1  Normalized absorption spectra of HXS-1 and PDFCDTBT in CF and CB solution (a) and in thin films (b). Theoretical calculations and electrochemical propertiesThe HOMO and LUMO energy level positions have pronounced influence on Voc, offset (the driving force for charge separation), and the overall photovoltaic performance. We have estimated the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the repeating units (the alkyl chains were simplified as methyls) of the corresponding alternating copolymers by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations that were performed at the B3LYP/6-31+G (d) level. The electron distribution of the HOMO and LUMO orbits of repeating units are shown in Fig. 2 and the simulated data are summarized in Table 1. With two fluorine atoms on the donor unit, lower LUMO and HOMO energy levels and a similar band gap for a repeating unit for PDFCDTBT were predicted.

CV measurements were performed in a solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) in acetonitrile (0.10 M) with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 at room temperature. A platinum electrode (∼0.05 cm2) coated with a thin polymer film was used as the working electrode. Pt wire and the Ag/AgNO3 electrode were used as the counter and reference electrode, respectively. A standard ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc) redox system was used as the internal standard for estimating the HOMO energy level of polymer films. The cyclic voltammograms are shown in Fig. 3, and the oxidation onsets are summarized in Table 1. Taking 4.8 eV as the HOMO level for the ferrocene/ferrocenium redox system, the HOMO energy levels of polymers were calculated according to the following equation: EHOMO = −(Eonset (polymer vs. Ag/Ag+) − Eonset (Fc/Fc+ vs. Ag/Ag+)) − 4.8 eV. Fig. 3  Cyclic voltammograms of the HXS-1 and PDFCDTBT films in 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 acetonitrile solution at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The oxidation onsets of HXS-1 and PDFCDTBT were estimated to be 0.50 and 0.52 V, which correspond to HOMO energy levels of −5.21 and −5.23 eV.21HXS-1 exhibits an irreversible process in the oxidation scan; whereas PDFCDTBT is partially reversible. The instability of polymer HXS-1 is probably due to the 3,6-positions of the carbazole ring in 2,7-linked carbazole polymers being highly active and it can form radical-cations of carbazolic units.20,22 The carbazole polymers can form cross-linking structures during the CV measurements.23 Because of the protection of the active 3,6-positions of carbazole by fluorine atoms, PDFCDTBT is more stable than HXS-1.24 Compared with HXS-1, a slightly lower HOMO energy level of PDFCDTBT will provide a slightly higher Voc for a photovoltaic device with a blend of PDFCDTBT and PC71BM as the active layer. The LUMO energy levels of polymers were calculated to be −3.35 eV for HXS-1 and −3.48 eV for PDFCDTBT by using the following equation: ELUMO − EHOMO = Eg,opt. The offsets (ELUMO of polymer − ELUMO of PC71BM) are 0.85 eV for HXS-1 and 0.72 eV for PDFCDTBT, which should provide enough of a driving force for efficient exciton dissociation in bulk heterojunction polymer–fullerene solar cells.25The thermal stability of polymers is also a very important parameter for the performance of the BHJ polymer solar cell devices. Thermal properties of the two polymers were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The TGA and DSC curves of PDFCDTBT are shown in Fig. S2.† The 5% weight loss temperatures (Td) and the glass transition temperatures (Tg) of PDFCDTBT and HXS-1 (ref. 9a) are summarized in Table 2 for a comparison. Since the molecular weight of polymers can have a significant influence on their thermal properties, the number- and weight-average molecular weights (Mn and Mw) of two polymers are also listed in Table 2. Although the molecular weight of PDFCDTBT is lower than HXS-1, the Td of PDFCDTBT is about 30 °C higher than that of HXS-1. The deeper HOMO energy level and the protection of the active 3,6-positions of the carbazole unit are probably responsible for the higher thermal stability of PDFCDTBT. In comparison with HXS-1, the glass transition temperature (Tg) of PDFCDTBT is also increased.

PDFCDTBT shows five diffraction peaks ranging from 5.36° to 24.1°, the first peak at a wide angle of 24.1° reflects a much closer π–π stacking distance of 3.7 Å between the polymer backbones, and the sharp and intense peak at 5.36° reflects a much more ordered packing of polymer chains with a distance of 16.5 Å between polymer backbones separated by alkyl side chains.27 The data from the X-diffraction are summarized in Table S1.† The much closer and more ordered packing of PDFCDTBT in the solid state is probably related to the highly favorable dipole–dipole interactions between conjugated polymer chains bearing fluoro atoms.28Transport propertiesThe transport properties of the polymers were investigated by fabricating organic thin film field effect transistors (OFETs). Typical p-channel field-effect transistor behavior was obtained. The hole mobility (μ) was estimated in the saturated regime from the derivative plots of the square root of source–drain current (ISD) versus gate voltage (VG) through equation ISD = (W/2L)Ciμ(VG − VT)2, where W is the channel width, L is the channel length, Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric layer (SiO2, 500 nm, Ci = 7.5 nF cm−2), and VT is the threshold voltage. The transfer characteristic curve of the spin-coated film of PDFCDTBT on OTS-treated Si/SiO2 substrates is shown in Fig. 4. The hole mobility of PDFCDTBT from DCB solution is 3.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 with an on/off ratio in the order of 105 by simple device fabrication without device optimization. Such high hole mobility is attributed to the strong π–π interactions between the planar polymer chains, especially, the presence of the fluoro atom can bring the polymer chain into closer proximity as evidenced by the XRD results. A closer distance between the polymer chains can facilitate the interchain charge hopping. Generally, mobility higher than 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 is desired for high-efficiency PSCs. Therefore, PDFCDTBT with high hole mobility is expected to be a promising material for solar cell applications. For HXS-1, it has been reported that the hole mobility was 1.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 without device optimization. We expect that the hole mobility of PDFCDTBT can be improved after further device optimization. Fig. 4  The transfer characteristics of the spin-coated film of PDFCDTBT transistor based on OTS-modified Si/SiO2 substrate. Photovoltaic propertiesThe photovoltaic properties of the polymers were investigated in devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/PDFCDTBT:PC71BM/LiF (0.5 nm)/Al (100 nm). The active layer is a blend of PDFCDTBT donor and PC71BM acceptor. PC71BM is chosen as the acceptor because it has similar electronic properties as PC61BM, but a higher absorption coefficient in the visible region with a broad peak from 440 to 530 nm, which compensates the absorption valley of the polymers. The device performance was screened by using different processing solvents, different ratios of PDFCDTBT to PC71BM, different concentrations, different spin-coating speeds, and different additives. The results are shown in Table S2–4 in the ESI.† Solar cells fabricated with a blend of PDFCDTBT and PC71BM in a weight ratio of 1:1.8 using TCB as the solvent gave the best performance with a PCE of 4.56%, a Voc of 0.91 V, a Jsc of 8.9 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.56. The typical current density–voltage (J–V) curves of photovoltaic cells with the blend of PDFCDTBT and PC71BM (1:1.8, by weight) as the active layer under 1 sun of simulated AM 1.5G solar radiation (100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 5. Without using the additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), HXS-1/PC71BM based devices exhibited a PCE of 3.60% with a Voc of 0.85 V, a Jsc of 8.3 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.51. Significantly, the PDFCDTBT based devices exhibited a higher Voc than HXS-1, which can be attributed to the lower HOMO energy level of PDFCDTBT than that of HXS-1. Additionally, compared with HXS-1, the lower PC71BM ratio and the higher FF for the optimized PDFCDTBT based devices indicated that PDFCDTBT probably possesses higher hole mobility, which can balance the electron mobility. Fig. 5  J–V curves of BHJ solar cells fabricated from the blend of PDFCDTBT:PC71BM (1:1.8, by weight) in TCB and TCB containing 10 vol% CN. 1,8-Diiodooctane (DIO) is a commonly used additive that enhances photovoltaic performance in PSCs.5f,10,29 Using 2.5 vol% DIO as the additive, the PCE of HXS-1 based solar cells was increased from 3.6 to 5.9%.9b However, the use of DIO as an additive for the fabrication of PDFCDTBT based solar cells did not show any positive effect on their photovoltaic performances. 1-Chloronaphthalene (CN) has been reported as a processing additive to increase the compatibility of polymers and PC71BM and to decrease the domain size.30 Therefore, TCB containing different amounts of CN were used for the fabrication of PDFCDTBT based solar cells. The device results are summarized in Table 3. The best photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 4.80%, a Voc of 0.91 V, a Jsc of 9.5 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.55 was achieved by using TCB containing 10 vol% CN as the processing solvent. Obviously, the increase of Jsc from 8.9 to 9.5 mA cm−2 contributes to the enhancement of the overall photovoltaic performance. Although the photovoltaic performance of PDFCDTBT based solar cells is inferior to that of HXS-1 based ones, PDFCDTBT is still considered a very promising donor material for high performance solar cells because of its lower HOMO energy level, narrower band gap, and higher hole mobility. The lower molecular weight and the poor film morphology (vide infra) of PDFCDTBT may be responsible for the poor photovoltaic performance. To evaluate the accuracy of the measurements, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the PSC devices fabricated from a blend of the polymer and PC71BM were measured under the illumination of monochromatic light. As shown in Fig. 6, a significant photo-to-current response can be observed in nearly the entire visible range of 370 to 600 nm with an EQE value of 45% for the PDFCDTBT based devices with CN (10 vol%). It is worth noting that the EQE curve of the PDFCDTBT:PC71BM based polymer solar cell is quite consistent with the corresponding absorption spectrum of the blend film. The current intensity (Jsc) calculated from the integration of the EQE of the device agrees roughly with the Jsc values obtained from the J–V measurements.

Film morphologiesThe morphology of the active layer, which is spontaneously formed during the solution processing, has a large influence on the performance of PSC, because it strongly affects the charge carrier generation, recombination, and transportation.31 Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to investigate the surface morphology of the PDFCDTBT:PC71BM blend (1:1.8) spin-coated from TCB solutions with and without the additive CN.32 As shown in Fig. 7, the blend film from pure TCB solution showed a rough surface with a large domain size, and the root-mean-square (rms) roughness is 0.326 nm. With the increase of volume of CN additive from 2 to 10%, the domain size of films became smaller and the surface morphology became less rough and more uniform. This result indicates that the additive CN can be used to modify the morphology of the active layer to achieve better photovoltaic performance.

The inset shows the images after executing particle analysis. ConclusionsIn summary, a novel difluoro substituted carbazole based D–A alternating conjugated polymer PDFCDTBT was successfully designed and synthesized. The introduction of two fluoro atoms at the 3,6-positions of the carbazole donor unit endowed the polymer PDFCDTBT with lower HOMO and LUMO energy levels and better thermal and electrochemical stability than HXS-1. In comparison with HXS-1, the fluoro containing PDFCDTBT showed stronger intermolecular interactions and formed closer π–π stacking and more ordered packing in the solid state. Photovoltaic devices with PDFCDTBT:PC71BM (1:1.8) as the active layer gave a PCE of 4.8% with a Voc of 0.91 V, a Jsc of 9.5 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.55. The good thermal and electrochemical stability, narrower band gap, and lower HOMO energy level made PDFCDTBT a promising donor material for practical photovoltaic applications. The reason why PDFCDTBT based solar cells exhibited a lower PCE than HXS-1 is probably due to the lower molecular weight of the polymer and poorer film morphology of the active layer. Molecular weight and film morphology have been proved to be critical to the photovoltaic performance of polymer solar cells. By further optimization of the chemical structure, for example, incorporating longer branched alkoxy side chains to the polymer backbone, we expect to synthesize high molecular weight PDFCDTBT to achieve high PCE. Further optimizations of the chemical structure, molecular weight, the morphology of the active layer, and the conditions for device fabrication are currently underway.AcknowledgementsWe thank the financial support by the 973 Program (2011CB935703 and 2009CB623603) and the NSF of China (91233205, 21161160443 and 50821062).Notes and references
