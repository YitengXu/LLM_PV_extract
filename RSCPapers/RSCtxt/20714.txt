    , Accepted 23rd March 2023First published on 30th March 2023AbstractMetal halide perovskites (MHPs) have received significant research attention owing to their unique inherent photophysical properties, endowing them potential application in the field of photoelectric detection. Among them, lead halide perovskite (LHP) photodetectors have been widely investigated and rapidly developed to a certain extent. However, the practical application of LHP photodetectors is limited by the toxicity of lead and the inherent instability of LHPs. Thus, to address these issues, environmentally friendly metal cations, such as Sn2+, Bi3+, Cu2+ and Sb3+, can be considered as replacements for Pb2+, as well as the use of high-stability single crystals as photoactive components. Overjavascript; the past few years, a large number of lead-free halide perovskites (LFHPs) have been explored to facilitate the application of photodetectors. In this review, we aim to provide an up-to-date analysis of the research progress on the large-size single crystals of both LHPs and LFHPs, focusing on their growth processes and techniques. Also, we provide a comprehensive summary of recent advances, strategies, and existing challenges and present perspectives on MHP single crystals to promote the development of photodetectors in the future.

1. Introduction
Photodetectors are devices that can capture optical signals in a specific spectral region and convert light radiation energy into different electric signals according to the optoelectronic properties of semiconductors,1–9 which can provide innovative and disruptive applications in signal (current or voltage) devices, high-speed optical communications, and high-resolution imaging in scientific research and industry.10–21 The semiconductor, as the essential part of photodetectors, absorbs incident photons and generates electron–hole pairs under photoinduced excitation. Under the action of an internal and external electric field, electrons and holes can be separated to move towards the electrodes to form a current. Nowadays, the manufacturing process and technology of photodetectors are basically mature and stable, and a large variety of semiconductor materials have been exploited in photodetectors, including Si, GaN, GaAS, and InGaAs.22–35 However, the manufacturing process of these inorganic semiconductors is harsh and complex, usually requiring high temperature and high vacuum environment, as well as the use of two intricate procedures of molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and metal–organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). Moreover, the intrinsic hardness of inorganic materials prevents their application in large-scale and flexible devices. Therefore, it is of great importance to explore more promising candidates, further simplify their fabrication process and improve the performance of photodetectors. Metal halide perovskites (MHPs),36 such as CH3NH3PbI3,37 have robust charge transfer capability, high light absorption coefficient,38,39 and straightforward film manufacturing process, and thus they have attracted much attention in the fields of light-emitting diodes, photovoltaic cells, and photodetectors in recent years. Thus far, a certified power conversion efficiency of 31.3% for perovskite/Si tandem and 25.7% for perovskite photovoltaic cells has been achieved after only several years of active research.40–42 The rapid and impressive progress has also prompted the exploration of the application of MHPs in photodetectors. To improve the key performance parameters of responsivity, detectivity and external quantum efficiency (EQE), many efforts have been devoted to designing highly sensitive photodetectors with wavelength selectivity, especially those based on perovskite single crystals. To date, perovskite photodetectors constructed with a variety of device configurations have been developed and demonstrated unprecedented progress in photoelectric detection. Among the MHPs, lead (Pb) halide perovskites (LHPs) have achieved great breakthroughs in photodetectors due to their attractive optoelectronic characteristics. For instance, the detectivity of LHP-based photodetectors has reached 1015 Jones.43 However, despite the exciting progress and extraordinary potential of LHPs, the commercialization of this emerging technology still faces serious challenges due to the presence of the toxic Pb and instability against moisture, heat, and irradiation. In recent years, significant efforts have been devoted to developing lead-free halide perovskites (LFHPs) and their derivative absorber materials. Amazingly, it has been observed that the performance displayed by LFHP-based photodetectors is comparable to that of LHP-based photodetectors, demonstrating the application potential of LFHPs in photoelectric detection. Furthermore, to replace Pb2+, some environmentally friendly metal cations, such as Sn2+,44,45 Cs+,46,47 Cu2+,48 Sb3+,49 and Bi3+,50 have been successfully implemented. In this case, the replacement lead-free halide perovskite must be in the cubic phase, similar to the original cubic lead-based perovskites, and the basic replacement criteria are as follows: (1) substituting elements with the same valence state, i.e., bivalent oxidation state metal cations; (2) substituting a single-valence metal cation and a trivalent metal cation, or a tetravalent metal cation and a vacancy site for two Pb2+ cations. If these replacement requirements are not followed, the trivalent oxidation of M(III) will break the neutral balance of ABX3 and generate a layered vacancy structure rather than a 3D structure. It should be emphasized that the choice of A and X site ions affects the dimensionality of the perovskite, which is not solely determined by the B locations. Perovskites with numerous morphologies including polycrystalline films, bulk crystals, nanosheets, nanowires, and quantum dots have different fabrication techniques, device constructions, and photoelectric capabilities. Alternatively, perovskite semiconductors are generally deposited as thin polycrystalline sheets. There are many grain boundaries and imperfections present on the surface of perovskite polycrystalline films, which will have a significant impact on the charge transfer, carrier diffusion length, and carrier lifespan. Polycrystalline films are composed of crystal grains with different lattice orientations and display varying characteristics due to crystal anisotropy, which has a negative impact on the resulting optoelectronic capabilities. Specifically, uneven orientation features negatively affect the performance of devices made from polycrystalline films. Although the further insertion of auxiliary transport layers (electron transport layer and hole transport layer) can increase their intrinsic properties and the optoelectronic device performance, large surface defect densities and grain boundaries result in more recombination sites, increasing the possibility of excited carriers recombining. Consequently, the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of photoelectric sensing systems is restricted, posing a significant barrier to their practical deployment. Therefore, perovskite single crystals with minimal defects, no visible grain boundaries, and few disordered energy states present a new research area for increasing the intrinsic properties of perovskite optoelectronic materials and the performance of optoelectronic devices due to their inherent benefits. Recently, it was demonstrated that large-size (millimeter level) single crystals of hybrid perovskites have significantly greater diffusion lengths, reaching 5 mm due to the absence of grain boundaries.51 These room-temperature-grown materials demonstrated how a highly ordered structure improves the electrical characteristics of solid perovskites. To produce perovskite single crystals of various sizes, it is necessary to understand and master the traditional process of producing single crystals in solution. In this case, despite the many efforts to produce LFHPs, comprehensive knowledge of the characteristics of materials in conjunction with their production technology is insufficient. The characteristics of materials are significantly influenced by their manufacturing procedures, particularly in optoelectronic device applications. Defects play a significant role in the efficient preparation of devices. Accordingly, defect control in perovskites can be achieved by adjusting the device fabrication procedures. Because of their high crystalline purity and fewer grain boundaries, high-quality single crystals provide an excellent platform for studying their intrinsic structural, optical, and electrical characteristics. These single crystals have a long, balanced carrier diffusion length, a longer carrier life-time, and low number of defect states. For large-scale optoelectronic integration, perovskite large-size single-crystalline thin films will considerably increase the device performance and stability.
To date, various reviews have been published on the development of crystalline perovskites and their optoelectronic applications, including solar cells, light-emitting diodes, field-effect transistors, and photodetectors.11,52–55 However, a complete study focused on perovskite large-size single crystal photodetectors, including a full explanation of the development of materials and device fabrication is lacking. Based on these facts, we aim to present an overall picture of the state of perovskite large-size single crystals in this review and offer fresh perspectives on future photodetector applications. Firstly, several different growth techniques that have been utilized to prepare perovskite large-size single crystals are summarized. Given the benefits and drawbacks of various perovskites, numerous typical and successful synthesis and preparation procedures for stable MHP single crystals are highlighted. Secondly, the photoelectric detecting features of both lead and lead-free perovskite large-size single crystals are presented. Finally, the development direction and breakthroughs of perovskite large-size single crystals and their photodetection devices in the future are briefly covered.
2. Key performance parameters of perovskite-based photodetectors
In the following section, we introduce the key parameters used to characterize the performance of photodetectors, i.e., the on–off ratio, spectral responsivity (R, A W−1), external quantum efficiency (EQE), specific detectivity (D*, Jones or cm Hz1/2 W−1), photoconductive gain (G), linear dynamic range (LDR, dB), noise equivalent power (NEP, W Hz−1/2), and response speed, to quantitatively evaluate and clearly compare the optoelectronic properties of the reported perovskite-based photodetectors.
(1) On–off ratio: the on–off ratio is defined as the ratio of photocurrent to dark current. The current flowing through a photodetector under dark and light conditions is referred to as the dark current density (JD) and the photocurrent density (JL), respectively. A large dark current, which is the main problem in integrated photodetection systems, undoubtedly increases the power consumption by the receiver. A high bit error rate (BER) is caused by the shot noise associated with leakage current, which unfavorably reduces the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In the design of a high-speed receiver, a dark current of <1 μA is often regarded as an acceptable threshold, below which the transimpedance amplifier noise is the dominant source of noise. In reality, the exact dark current value is determined by the operating speed and amplifier type. In general, the incident light intensity and wavelength have a significant impact on the on–off ratio. Consequently, the on–off ratios of various photodetectors should be evaluated under comparable test conditions.
(2) Spectral responsivity (R): the photocurrent generated by the device in the external circuit under the action of the input unit optical power is referred to as spectral responsivity. As a more practical format for expressing EQE, R is defined as the photocurrent to incident light intensity ratio, which represents the mutual conversion capacity between the input optical signal and the output electrical signal of the photodetector. A high R value indicates the photodetector has a strong capacity for photoelectric conversion, which can be calculated using the following formula:  where ΔI is the photogenerated current, P is the incident light intensity (power density), A is the effective illumination area of the photodetector, Jlight is the current density under light, Jdark is the dark current density, and Llight is the incident-light intensity. Herein, the responsivity is different from the sensitivity. The former refers to the effectiveness of the conversion of an optical signal into an electrical signal, while the latter refers to the lowest detectable light level of a photodetector. The key influencing factor of the sensitivity is the detection bandwidth, which is related to SNR.
(3) External quantum efficiency (EQE): the external quantum efficiency refers to the ratio of the number of charges collected by the electrode to the number of incident photons, which depends on the absorption of incident light and charge. It reflects the conversion efficiency between the input optical signal and the output electrical signal of the photodetector. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE), frequently referred to as the EQE of photodetectors, is the ratio of the number of holes or electrons collected by the associated electrode to the number of incident photons. In some cases, it may exceed 100%, which can be calculated according to the following formula:  where e is the electron charge, h is Planck's constant, v is the incoming photon frequency, λ is the incident-light wavelength, q is the absolute value of the electron charge, R is the responsivity, and c is the speed of light.
(4) Noise equivalent power (NEP, W Hz−1/2): the noise equivalent power represents the minimum incident light power corresponding to the output signal of the photodetector distinguished from noise. The smallest optical signal that may be detected is determined by the noise in photodetectors. A photodetector with a smaller NEP can detect a weaker light signal. It reflects the ability of the device to detect weak signals, which is equal to the reciprocal of D*. The optical power of incident light is defined as NEP when the signaltonoise ratio (SNR) is 1 over a bandwidth of 1 Hz, signifying the least optical power that can be distinguished from noise by a photodetector. It is best characterized as follows:  where in is the noise current. The limitation of using NEP for the characterization of the photodetector performance is that it is specific to the active area of the device.
(5) Specific detectivity (D*): the specific detection rate is defined as the reciprocal of the noise equivalent power (NEP), also called normalized detectivity, which can be used to characterize the ability of the device to detect the minimum optical signal, that is, the minimum optical signal that the device can detect above its noise level. The detectivity is frequently used to describe a the sensitivity of a photodetector, which is unaffected by the active area of the device. The detectivity is normalized to the active area, which is equal to the square root of AΔf divided by NEP. With the help of this parameter, it is possible to compare photodetectors with various geometries and assess the sensitivity of photoactive materials rather than individual devices. The detectivity, which is determined by the response and noise, can be calculated according to the following formula:  where Δf is the electrical frequency bandwidth and NEP is the noise-equivalent power. The photodetector noise consists of the shot noise, thermal noise, flicker (1/f) noise, and generation-recombination noise. If the shooting noise from the dark current dominates the overall device noise, the D* formula can be reduced as follows:  Similar to R, D* depends on a variety of factors, including the applied bias, temperature, modulation frequency, and wavelength. It is necessary to quantify the noise power spectral density to assess the D* of photodetectors.
(6) Linear dynamic range (LDR): the dynamic range is used to describe the operational light intensity range of a photodetector and quantify its ability to adequately capture light intensity variations under any conditions, which can be expressed as the ratio of maximum (Imax) to minimum detectable current (Imin). A large linear dynamic range (LDR) is desirable for a photodetector that can detect both strong and weak light to be efficiently used in practical applications. Nonetheless, the photodetector can also be used outside of the LDR if its behavior is well understood. The LDR measures the detectable linear range, in which the photogenerated current vs. incident light intensity is a linear function. This is a crucial metric for evaluating the photosensitivity linearity of a photodetector, which can be calculated according to the following formula:  where  and  are the maximum and minimum values of the linear range of detectable current density, respectively.
(7) Photoconductive gain (G): Gain is also used to describe how well optical signals are converted into electrical signals for photodetectors. The number of charge carriers passing across the electrode gap induced by per incident photon is specified as G. If the carrier transit time (τt) between two electrodes is less than the carrier recombination lifespan (τl), one photogenerated carrier can travel through the electrode separation several times before recombination. Thus, G may be written as:  where μ is the carrier mobility, V is the applied bias voltage, and d is the electrode spacing.
(8) Response speed: the response speed is an indicator of the response time. The response speed of photodetectors is strongly related to the carrier trapping/detrapping and recombination processes. Photodetectors must have a quick reaction speed to track the changing speed of the incident light signal. In general, there is a time delay between the electrical signal output by the photodetector and the received optical signal. The output current of the photodetector increases as the incident light is switched on and falls as the incident light is shut off.
The temporal response of a photodetector is commonly defined by its rise/fall (decay) time or −3 dB bandwidth. The input light modulation frequency at which the output signal is −3 dB lower than the signal produced under continuous wave (CW) illumination is known as the −3 dB bandwidth (f−3dB) of photodetectors. Specifically, at this modulation frequency, the photo-response of a photodetector is half as high as it is at CW modulation. The carrier transit time (τtransit) and RC time of the circuit define f−3dB.
The response time is usually used to describe the delay degree of the signal, that is, the response speed of the detector. Thus, to facilitate the extraction of response speed information, the response time usually takes the time required for the output photocurrent to increase from 10% to 90% of the maximum value as the rise time of the detector, and the time required for the photocurrent to fall from 90% to 10% of the maximum value as the fall time. It is closely related to the transmission and collection of photogenerated carriers, which shows that a larger electrode spacing (carrier transmission path length) is not conducive to improving the optical response speed of the device and a smaller electrode spacing is conducive to improving the optical response speed of the device.
3. Excellent properties of perovskite large-size single crystals
It is well known that perovskite large-size single crystals have been successfully used in photodetectors, which currently exhibit improved properties, such as redshifted absorption, better charge transport capability, and higher stability.56–61 In the following section, we provide an overview of the benefits of perovskite large-size single crystals over polycrystalline thin films.
3.1 Optical quality
Given that perovskite large-size single crystals can make better use of low band gap absorption compared with polycrystalline thin films, their absorption range is commonly red-shifted (Fig. 1a).62 The sub-bandgap absorption in MAPbI3 is mainly attributed to its indirect-bandgap absorption transition with a bandgap of ≈60 meV smaller than its direct-bandgap. Because the absorption coefficient of sub-bandgap absorption is several orders of magnitude less than that of above-bandgap absorption, it is insignificant in polycrystalline thin films but visible in thick single crystals. Single crystals and polycrystalline thin films of MAPbI3 have absorbance onsets of 850 and 780 nm, respectively (Fig. 1b).63,64 The top limit of the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells increase due to the redshift in the absorption region. By assuming that the carrier diffusion length is higher than the crystal thickness, Chen et al. theoretically calculated the performance of perovskite single-crystal solar cells as a function of thickness (Fig. 1c).65 The maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) was set at 90% to account for the light absorption loss caused by the indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate. In this instance, the expanded absorption spectra caused the Jsc to increase from 23.0 to 27.1 mA cm−2 as the thickness of the perovskite crystals increased from 500 nm to 200 μm. According to the diode equation, a thicker diode will result in more charge recombination during carrier transport and more reverse bias saturated dark current density (J0), which will lower the open-circuit voltage (Voc). The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the MAPbI3 single crystal solar cells initially increased, and subsequently declined with an increase in the crystal thickness, and the fill factor (FF) was marginally altered. The theoretical efficiency of a 500 nm-thick single crystal was significantly lower than that of a 200 μm-thick single crystal.

3.2 Electric quality
The charge trap densities on the surface and grain boundaries of perovskite polycrystalline thin films are significantly greater than that in their bulk single crystals.66 The charge traps are mostly found on the surface in bulk single crystals given that there are no grain boundaries inside the crystal. Consequently, compared to thin films, perovskite single crystals have substantially lower charge trap densities.63,67 Bulk single crystal perovskites often have trap densities in the range of 1010 cm−3, which are much lower than that of polycrystalline thin films (Fig. 2a).63,67–71 The reduced trap density of single crystals results in improved electrical characteristics, including greater carrier mobilities and longer carrier lifetimes and carrier diffusion lengths (Fig. 2b–d).63,67,71–73 A lower trap density for a given thickness reduces J0, increasing the Voc of the solar cell.74 Alternatively, better electrical characteristics facilitate the transport and collection of carriers.75 The link between the grain size and efficiency of 500 nm-thick MAPbI3 solar cells was theoretically determined by Huang et al. The efficiency increased from 22.5% to 25.3% with an increase in the domain size from 1 μm (polycrystalline film) to 1 mm when the surface charge traps were properly passivated (Fig. 2e).74

3.3 Stability
The lack of grain boundaries in perovskite single crystals results in more robust stability and higher optoelectronic capabilities than polycrystalline thin films.76,77 The very thin amorphous intergranular layer at the grain boundaries of polycrystalline thin films is particularly susceptible to moisture, which quickly diffuses along the grain boundaries into the film because the grain borders have a considerably more open structure than the crystalline areas.78 Consequently, it has been observed that the moisture-induced deterioration of MAPbI3 polycrystalline thin films starts at the grain boundaries and becomes more serious as the grain size gets smaller (Fig. 3a and b).78 In contrast, Wang et al. discovered that MAPbI3 single crystals stored in ambient air for two years without encapsulation maintained their black color and possessed glossy crystal facets without any discernible deterioration.78 The current–voltage hysteresis and low photo stability of perovskite photodetectors are partially attributed to ion migration, which has been proven to be caused by vacancy or interstitial defects by means of both theoretical calculations and experimental evidence.79 According to the study by Shao et al., the majority of the ion movement in an MAPbI3 polycrystalline thin film happens near the grain boundaries, where the structure is relatively open together with abundant defects (Fig. 3c).80 In contrast, perovskite single crystals have the capacity to limit ion migration due to their tight structure and low trap density. The considerably thicker single crystal solar cells also decrease the strength of the electric field across the perovskite layer, which can lessen the force that drives ion migration. Consequently, it was discovered that perovskite single crystal devices exhibit very little current hysteresis and ion migration signals.80 Moreover, the absence of grain boundaries narrows the channel for the thermo-induced volatilization of the organic iodide, endowing perovskite single crystals with superior thermal stability compared to polycrystalline thin films. In contrast to the breakdown temperature of MAPbI3 polycrystalline thin films, thermogravimetric analysis demonstrated that MAPbI3 single crystals are stable up to 240 °C.81,82

4. Perovskite large-size single crystal growth techniques
MHP single crystals are typically synthesized using a variety of growth processes, including the inverse temperature crystallization (ITC) method,71,83–86 slow cooling method,87 anti-solvent vapor-assisted crystallization method,88–90 top-seeded solution growth (TSSG) method,59 bottom-seeded solution growth (BSSG) method,91 slow evaporation method,92 and Bridgman technique,93 as shown in Fig. 4. The perovskite precursors are commonly combined in polar solvents (e.g., g-butyrolactone [GBL], N,N-dimethylformamide [DMF], and dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO) in the ITC crystal formation approach, whereas in the gradual cooling method, the precursors are dissolved in acidic media (e.g., HI, HBr, and HCl). The solution mixtures are heated to a high temperature in both circumstances. The single crystals precipitate and develop from the solution throughout the cooling process. The perovskite precursors are dissolved in acids such as HI, HBr, HCl, and H3PO2 during the TSSG single crystal growth method. After some time, the growth of a gleaming single crystal may be seen surrounding the seed perovskite crystal. The precise control of temperature is critical in the BSSG crystal formation technique. The BSSG and TSSG single crystal growth procedures are utilized depending on the location of the seed crystals. Two solvent combinations are utilized in the anti-solvent vapor-assisted crystallization process, with the perovskite precursors being highly soluble in one but poorly soluble in the other. Initially, the perovskite precursors are melted in a high-temperature furnace, and then the melted solution is transported from the hot zone to the cold zone, where perovskite seed crystals are formed. When the solution comes into contact with the seed crystals below the solidification temperature, crystal development begins at the melt-seed interface, resulting in the formation of a single large-sized solid single-crystalline ingot of perovskite structure. The source continues to feed raw materials for single crystal development, and eventually harvests the crystal63 by regulating the supersaturation principle produced by the temperature differential between the bottom and the top. The manufacturing methods for large-size single-crystal perovskites, primarily lead and lead-free ones, are thoroughly described in this section. Their optical and electrical characteristics are also briefly detailed in addition to the crystal formation technique. Table 1 presents a summary of the different growth methods for MHP single crystals.

4.1 Lead-based perovskite crystal growth techniques
The formation of single crystals is affected by several factors, including the type of precursor, solvents and antisolvents, solubility, solution concentration, and temperature. The precursor solution made from initial perovskite materials is a colloidal dispersion rather than a dissociated solution. Thus, the qualities of the raw materials usually have a significant influence on the produced colloidal properties. Therefore, the colloid in the precursor has varying properties dependent on the raw materials used, such as lead iodide (PbI2) materials from various manufacturers and batches. To create PbI2 with a tunable crystal plane ratio and crystal size, Ran developed a crystal plane passivation technique,94 in which the tunable crystal plane ratios and crystal sizes of PbI2 could be controlled by varying the amount of acetic acid in the preparation reaction system. This study also demonstrated that by using PbI2 with various morphologies, it is possible to control the size and distribution of PbI2 colloidal particles, the surface morphology and crystal orientation of PbI2 films, and the photoelectric properties of the corresponding methylamine lead iodide (MAPbI3) films. The energy conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells based on the optimized PbI2 reached 20.22%, as well as a reduced forward-reverse hysteresis effect compared to commercial PbI2 materials. Moreover, it is discovered that preparing the appropriate quantity of acid in the precursor solution can speed up the formation of single crystals together with the high quality.60,72,82 By carefully examining the growth process of perovskite single crystals, Snaith et al.95 later clarified the mechanism of adding acid to the precursor solution for the acceleration of the crystal growth rate. Specifically, the addition of acid can cause the precursor colloid to decompose, increasing the concentration of free ions in the solution, and then resulting in the saturation of the solution to induce crystallization. When the precursor colloid dissolves over time, the concentration of free ions such as Pb2+, halogen ions, and MAH+ in the solution increases. Perovskite crystals begin to form when the critical nucleation concentration is achieved. As can be observed, the addition of acid may significantly speed up the breakdown of the precursor colloid and the perovskite formation. The temperature fluctuations of the supersaturated precursor solution causes the growth of tiny clusters of molecules, which leads to the growth of stable nuclei with a reduction in the overall Gibb's free energy. Controlling nucleation is critical for the formation of single crystals with a precise size, shape, and perfection. The defect density increases with the perovskite single crystal growth temperature. Thus, the perovskite single crystal structure will be negatively impacted by the heat convection caused by a decrease or increase in temperature, and twins or polycrystals easily grow.96 When the concentration of the precursor solution is extremely close to the critical point of nucleation, the molecules begin to aggregate and single crystals of a specified size and shape are formed. If the concentration exceeds the critical point of nucleation, numerous nuclei will gather and form a crystalline powder. In contrast, if the concentration is less than the critical threshold, no nuclei will emerge.

4.1.1 Bulk single crystals. 
Perovskite crystals can be generated quickly by increasing the temperature of the DMF/DMSO/GBL precursor solution, which is derived from the inconsistent solubility of perovskites in these solvents. Fig. 5 demonstrates that the solubility of MAPbI3/MAPbBr3/MAPbCl3 increased with an increase in solution temperature.84,97 The greatest concentration of perovskites in the solution may be regulated by altering the temperature in accordance with the solubility curve. Perovskite crystals will precipitate toward the bottom of the saturated precursor solution during heating because the precursor concentration is higher than what the solubility permits. High-quality perovskite crystals were formed swiftly using this technique, and a 5 mm-size crystal was achieved within 3 h.97 It was discovered after thorough analysis that a certain solvent is more effective for a particular halide perovskite. For MAPbCl3, MAPbBr3, and MAPbI3,84 the optimum solvents are DMSO, DMF, and GBL, respectively.
 Fig. 5  Solubility of MAPbI3/MAPbBr3/MAPbCl3 decreased as the temperature of the solution increased, clearly demonstrating the decrease in solubility at elevated temperatures.

4.1.1.1 Inverse temperature crystallization (ITC). 
In the case of materials whose solubility in a given solvent is high at room temperature but declines with an increase in temperature, the inverse temperature crystallization technique is appropriate. To quickly generate free-standing single crystals, while avoiding the time-consuming traditional crystallization processes, such as the usual cooling or antisolvent vapor-assisted crystallization techniques, the inverse temperature crystallization approach was initially developed. The foundation of the ITC approach is the peculiar solubility of organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskites in particular organic solvents. The reported single crystals, which were created using the conventional one-step inverse temperature crystallization (ITC), have comparatively inferior crystalline quality, which significantly reduces the performance of their photodetectors.
To create high-quality MAPbCl3 single crystals, Cheng et al. created a new two-step temperature procedure that involves lower temperature nucleation and higher temperature crystallization.85Fig. 6a shows the growth process of MAPbCl3 single crystals. The crystal that was produced using this technique has outstanding crystalline quality. Lead chloride (PbCl2) and methylammonium chloride (MACl) with an equimolar ratio were dissolved in a mixture of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a volume ratio of 1:1 at room temperature to produce MAPbCl3 single crystals. This was done after pouring the precursor solution into some vials for 5 h and maintaining them in an oil bath at 45 °C. Subsequently, the temperature of the oil bath was then swiftly increased to 60 °C and maintained for 8 h, as seen in Fig. 6d and e. As can be observed, the surface of the sample is very flat and devoid of any visible grain boundaries. Additionally, the photodetector based on an MAPbCl3 single crystal exhibited long-term stability for more than 50 days when left under ambient conditions. According to the study by Zuo et al., this technique can also be used to generate MAPbBr3 single crystals.98 Controlling the orientation of the seed crystal and the growth circumstances led to the creation of a triangular prism MAPbBr3 single crystal with (100) and (110) crystallographic planes. A schematic representation of the MAPbBr3 single crystal formation method is shown in Fig. 6b. A tiny triangular prism seed crystal was required to develop a triangular prism MAPbBr3 single crystal with an exposed (110) face (Fig. 6c). In a 60 °C water bath, PbBr2 and CH3NH3Br were combined with DMF. Then, the solution was heated at 90 °C until no discernible signs of undissolved salts were present. Cubic MAPbBr3 single crystals were produced after 24 h. A cubic MAPbBr3 single crystal was used to cut the tiny triangular prism seed crystal. Subsequently, the same concentration of triangular prism seed crystal was added to the solution. After two days of heating the solution at 85 °C, an MAPbBr3 single crystal with a triangular prism was produced. The size of the single crystal reached 5 mm × 5 mm × 7 mm by carefully adjusting the solution concentration and growth temperature. Zhang et al.86 produced large-sized MAPbI3 single crystals with concurrently exposed (110), (112), (100), and (001) crystal planes by varying the ratios of PbI2 to methylammonium iodide (MAI), as shown in Fig. 6f. Weak n-type, high-quality MAPbI3 single crystals ranging from rhombic polyhedron to cubic polyhedron were created by carefully regulating the MAI concentration of the solution.86 According to reports, the majority of MAPbI3 single crystals were produced by dissolving equal molar ratios of MAI to PbI2 in γ-GBL. When creating the precursor solution, Zhang et al. suggested a unique approach by altering the stoichiometric proportions of PbI2 and MAI in the range of 1:1–1:1.5. Violent swirling at 50 °C for more than 6 h resulted in the complete dissolution of the basic ingredients. After two days, adaptable morphological MAPbI3 single crystals could be effectively produced at 85 °C.

Saidaminov et al. designed an innovative crystallization method for these materials, referred to here as inverse temperature crystallization (ITC), to rapidly grow high-quality size and shape-controlled single crystals of both MAPbBr3 and MAPbI3.71 The adaptability of the their method enables the continued development of crystals through the replenishment of the depleted growth fluid and the application of templates to regulate their forms. Fig. 7a shows how this inverse solubility phenomenon was employed to cause MAPbX3 to crystallize quickly in hot liquids. For X = Br−, I−, a single molar solution of PbX2 and MAX was made in DMF or GBL. For the production of Br−- and I−-based perovskites, 2 mL of the filtrate was put in a vial and the vial was left in an oil bath at 80 °C and 110 °C. The development of MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 crystals using the ITC method is shown in Fig. 7b in a number of pictures. Carefully extracting the crystal and depositing it in a fresh 1 M solution of the precursors allowed for further crystal formation. The geometry of the crystallization vessel can influence the form of the crystal. To create single crystals of MAPbBr3 and MAPbI3 with a variety of forms, the geometry of the vessel in which the crystallization occurs was altered (Fig. 7c).

Comparing CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx with CH3NH3PbI3, Wang et al. discovered that Br doping enhances the efficiency stability of CH3NH3PbI3.99 Bulk single crystals of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx were grown using the ITC technique (Fig. 8). In the combined solvents of DMF-GBL at 70 °C, CH3NH3I and PbI2, and CH3NH3Br and PbBr2 with the molar ratio of PbI2:PbBr2, respectively, were dissolved. Similar to the molar ratios of PbBr2 and PbI2, the volume ratios of DMF and GBL were identical. Then, the solutions were then heated and maintained at 100 °C to crystallize CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx.

It is well acknowledged that FAPbX3 is more stable than MAPbX3. Through the substitution of the small MA cation with a larger FA cation, FAPbX3 was created, further demonstrating the narrowing of the perovskite bandgap. In polycrystalline thin films, the bandgap decreased from 1.6 eV to 1.48 eV, suggesting a potential increase in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of FAPbI3-based solar cells. Presently, in the most effective perovskite solar cells, MAPbX3 is replaced with FAPbI3, with PCE values approaching 20%.12 Additionally, by choosing the right solvent, ITC can be used to prepare FAPbX3 perovskites in addition to MAPbX3 perovskites. The solubilities of the hybrid perovskites were tested in a variety of solvents and at various temperatures to confidently validate the retrograde solubility behavior. It was found that g-butyrolactone (GBL) is typically an appropriate solvent for I-based perovskites, whereas the more polar N,N-dimethyl-formamide (DMF) is an appropriate solvent for Br-based ones to induce retrograde solubility. Fig. 9 illustrates how temperature affects the solubility of lead halides made of methylammonium and formamidinium. Bakr et al. successfully developed crack- and grain boundary-free black crystals in 3 h using 0.8 M solution to increase the crystallization temperature to 115 °C, and in 1 M solution in DMF: GBL with the crystallization beginning at 55 °C to generate crack-free crystals.84

Based on inversion crystallization, it is suggested to optimize the bulk crystal preparation procedure, which is gradient inversion crystallization. To create high-quality perovskite single crystals, the inversion temperature precision gradient crystallization (ITPGC) technique has been devised. Different temperature gradients (60 °C, 70 °C, 80 °C, 100 °C, and 120 °C) are created to not only determine the ideal temperature for creating single crystals but also to quickly generate samples with a high degree of crystallization and the right number. Based on the procedure described above,100 Yuan et al. combined CH3NH3Cl and PbCl2 with a mixture of DMF and DMSO to create a clear precursor solution. Heating the solution to a set temperature will cause it to crystallize quickly. Precursor solutions often get saturated by gradually increasing the temperature. The crystal nucleus was easily visible as soon as the degree of saturation was reached, and crystallization started to occur concurrently. Fig. 7 provides a graphic illustration of the growth process (Fig. 10a). A few of the typical CH3NH3PbCl3 single crystals are shown in Fig. 10b, together with the crystals that originated from the best condition and had the (100) crystallographic plane. These crystals were cuboid in form and had a clear hue. Fig. 10c depicts CH3NH3PbCl3 single crystals at various temperatures, allowing one to detect the propensity for fluctuation in both the number and size of CH3NH3PbCl3 single crystals. The size and number of CH3NH3PbCl3 single crystals were produced when the temperature was controlled under the assumption that the volume ratio was 1:1 (Fig. 7d). The 6 mm × 6 mm × 2 mm-sized perovskite crystals that were produced had a cubic structure. Ultra-high crystallinity could be seen in the single crystal.

According to the study by Liu et al., the growth temperature has a significant impact on both the yield of crystallization and quality of the resulting single crystals.101 The preparation method is shown in Fig. 11a–d. By controlling the growth conditions to be well inside the optimal single-crystal-growth (OSCG) zone with a low crystal growth rate for a regulated solute diffusion rate to limit the defect density, a high-quality, two-inch-sized MAPbBr3 single crystal was produced. Firstly, a 1:1 molar ratio of the MABr and PbBr2 precursors was dissolved in DMF solvent. The solution was kept at 25 °C with vigorous mixing for 24 h before being filtered to ensure adequate dissolution. With a modest ramp rate of 2 °C per day, the setup was gradually heated from 25 °C to 60 °C after adding a preselected crystallite to the solution. Without the production of new crystallites, the old crystal progressively became bigger. It should be mentioned that crystallization occurred in a closed oven kept at a consistent temperature for around 20 days. It was possible to obtain a big (47 × 41 × 14 mm) and excellent MAPbBr3 single crystal.

4.1.1.2 Solution temperature-lowering (STL). 
The temperature-lowering technique has evolved into the standard approach for producing large-size organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskite single crystals. It is a variation of the original Weber technique. Typically, millimeter-sized crystals are first created, and then big bulk single crystals are seeded to grow. The bottom-seeded solution growth (BSSG) and top-seeded solution growth (TSSG) techniques have been established based on various fixed positions of the seed crystals.
MAPbCl3 single crystals with the (100) and (110) crystallographic planes were effectively formed from mixed solutions.102 Equivalent mole ratios of PbCl2 and CH3NH3Cl were dissolved at room temperature in a mixture of DMF and DMSO in quartz containers. Subsequently, the sealed transparent precursor solutions were kept at 80 °C for 6–7 days. Small seed crystals of cubic perovskite MAPbCl3 about 1–2 mm in size were collected. The seed crystals grew bigger to become perfect cubic MAPbCl3 single crystals with diameters in the range of 4–8 mm based on use of the temperature reverse solubility of MAPbCl3 in mixed solvents of DMF and DMSO. Using the aforementioned procedures, large-sized triangle prism MAPbCl3 single crystals with the (100) and (110) crystallographic planes were also produced (Fig. 12c).

Su et al. reported the outcomes of the hydrohalic acid solution method for the successful development of CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbBr3 single crystals up to centimeter sizes (Fig. 13a and b, respectively).103 Large-size crystals with ideal shapes were achieved by a very slow cooling rate of 0.1–0.2 °C h−1. By using the cooling solution procedure, crystals were produced. CH3NH2 and HI were combined to create CH3NH3I, which was then placed in a sealed container and kept at 0 °C for 2 h to allow the full mixing of the solution. A solution of Pb2+-HI was created by adding and dissolving PbI2 in HI. When Pb2+-HI and CH3NH3I finally reacted, black precipitates started to form immediately. At 90 °C, a somewhat saturated solution was produced. Consequently, the combined solution was heated at 90 °C for 48 h, filtered to remove the black precipitates, and then cooled at a rate of 0.1–0.2 °C h−1 to 45 °C. The preparation process is identical to that for CH3NH3PbI3 for the development of CH3NH3PbBr3, in which the growth temperature was lowered from 70 °C to 50 °C. For more than 10 days, orange crystals with a rough size of 5 mm were produced. Large MAPbBr3 single crystals were grown by Sum et al.104 Without any additional purification, all salts and solvents were employed in their original form. In DMF, a 1 M solution of PbBr2 and MABr was created (Fig. 13c). The vials were maintained in a 70 °C electric oven with an ambient humidity level of around 50%. After 30 min, tiny crystals were collected. A tiny crystal was carefully removed from the vial and placed into a new vial with fresh solution to create a larger crystal. The measurement crystals were grown for 1.5 h. Huang et al. reported the growth of MAPbBr3−xClx and MAPbI3−xBrx mixed-halide perovskite single crystals with their absorption edge continuously adjusted from blue to red.37 Methylamine, single or mixed haloid acids with various halide ratios, and lead(II) acetate were combined to create a super-saturated aqueous solution at 100 °C, which was then used to create the precursor solution. By gradually reducing the temperature, the single crystals were precipitated from the precursor solution. It is simple to create single crystals with a thickness of 0.5 to 5 mm. Fig. 13d shows images of typical mono-halide and mixed-halide perovskite single crystals with various Cl/Br and Br/I precursor ratios. With an increase in the Br/(Cl + Br) molar ratio from 0 to 1 in the precursor solution, the hue of the MAPbBr3−xClx single crystals progressively changed from clear to yellow, and then to orange. With an increase in the I/(I + Br) molar ratio, the color of the MAPbI3−xBrx single crystals progressively changed from orange to red. By using surface tension, Liu's group successfully synthesized two-dimensional (PEA)2PbI4 single crystals with a maximum size of up to 36 mm.83 The process to prepare (PEA)2PbI4 single crystals is shown in Fig. 13e. Specifically, the (PEA)2PbI4 solution was prepared by dissolving PbI2 and C6H5C2H4NH3I in g-butyrolactone (GBL) at 105 °C with vigorous stirring for 24 h (Fig. 13e1). The tiny crystallite grew on the solution surface when the temperature was cooled at a regulated rate of 0.5 °C h−1 to 95 °C (Fig. 13e2). Then the tiny crystallite grew bigger, while still floating on the solution surface when the temperature was lowered to 85 °C (Fig. 13e3). With a further decrease in the temperature to 75 °C, the crystallite grew large enough to begin to slowly sink to the bottom of the container (Fig. 13e4). As the process was allowed to continue until the temperature decreased to 30 °C, a bigger (PEA)2PbI4 single crystal was obtained (Fig. 13e5). Fig. 13f and g show photographs of the (PEA)2PbI4 single crystal completed at different stages of the growth process.

A simple technique was created by Liu et al. to produce perovskite crystals with good crystalline quality that are 2 inches in size.81Fig. 14a–c show photographs of a few sample perovskite (CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I)) crystals. Gamma-butyrolactone (GBA) was used as the precursor solution to develop big single-crystalline CH3NH3PbI3. By holding 20 mL of precursor solution at 100 °C for 24 h, tiny perovskite particles with a diameter of 2 mm were obtained as seed crystals. When a seed crystal was submerged in 20 mL of precursor solution and held at 100 °C for 48 h, it developed into a 7 mm long perovskite crystal. The crystals developed at a faster rate when the temperature was increased in the temperature range of 80 °C to 100 °C. Fig. 14e and f show images of crystal formation with and without seed crystals during a 12 h period. By methodically improving the solution concentration, it was discovered that the best concentration for the reaction condition is [CH3NH3PbI3] ≈ 1.23 M. Tao's group reported a temperature-lowering synthesis and bulk crystal growth procedure.82 In the presence of air, freshly synthesized methyl-ammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) was reacted with Pb(CH3COOH)2·H2O in hydroiodic acid (HI) solution. A 500 mL round-bottom flask was filled with an aqueous HI mixture. Pb(CH3COOH)2·3H2O was dissolved in aqueous HI under continual stirring according to the stoichiometric ratio of Pb(CH3COOH)2·3H2O and CH3NH3I, yielding a yellow solution. Then, CH3NH3I was added to the yellow solution. After several days of effectively growing at the bottom of the flask with a reduction in temperature from 65 °C to 40 °C to promote solute saturation, a black and lustrous crystal of CH3NH3PbI3, with a size of 10 mm × 10 mm × 8 mm was obtained and washed and filtered with HI, and then acetone (Fig. 14d). In contrast, yellow needle-like crystals of (CH3NH3)4PbI6·2H2O emerged at the bottom of the flask at lower temperatures.

Although STL procedures are easy, practical, and appropriate for growing large-sized MAPbX3 single crystals, they are time-consuming. Obtaining one-centimeter-sized crystals normally takes 2–4 weeks. Recently, Sun et al. showed that massive single crystals of perovskite MAPbI3 could be quickly formed from chlorine-containing solutions.72 They were motivated to use chlorine to mediate the solution growth process to generate high-quality MAPbI3(Cl) bulk single crystals. The chlorine promoters significantly increased the growth rate. Within 5 days, a 20 mm × 18 mm × 6 mm MAPbI3(Cl) single crystal was obtained (Fig. 14g–i). A microscope was used to examine its mirror-like flawless surface. Then, lead(II) acetate trihydrate was dissolved in hydroiodic acid, and heated and stirred for 10 min at 100 °C. By dissolving methylamine hydroiodide and methylamine hydrochloride in hydroiodic acid, an MA+ combination was created. Separately, the two solutions were heated to 130 °C and agitated for 2 h before being combined. Small MAPbI3 crystals were formed spontaneously by quickly reducing the solution temperature from 108 °C to 60 °C. The bottom-seeded solution growth approach was used to generate bulk single crystals of MAPbI3(Cl). A carefully chosen seed crystal was put in a borosilicate glass bottle and slowly heated in an oil bath to 105 °C. Then, the bottle was swiftly filled with the aforementioned growth solution. The temperature was held at 105 °C for 1 h to dissolve the outer surface of the seed crystal, and then swiftly decreased to 100 °C, followed by a cooling rate of 0.2 °C h−1 for 12 h, then 0.5 °C h−1 to 60 °C, and finally 1 °C h−1 to 40 °C. Small crystals evolved to huge sizes throughout this period. Altogether, it took about 5 days to grow the large 20 mm × 18 mm × 6 mm MAPbI3(Cl) single crystal. The average growth rate was estimated at around 18 mm 3 h−1. It is worth noting that as the seed crystal grows larger, spontaneous heterogeneous nucleation may occur on the bottom of the glass bottle due to the presence of impurity particles, ions, or rough surfaces. These effects may affect the growth of large single crystals. To minimize the side nucleation on the bottom of the bottle, these two factors should be carefully considered. Initially, the substrate should be as smooth as possible to decrease the number of nucleation sites. Secondly, the growth solution should be thoroughly heated to guarantee complete disintegration. It eventually developed into the formation of MAPbI3(Cl) single crystals.
4.1.1.3 Antisolvent vapor-assisted crystallization (AVC). 
The AVC technique crystallizes perovskite by taking advantage of its variable solubility in different solvents. Unlike the STL and ITC methods, the AVC approach is not affected by temperature. Consequently, the temperature-dependent phase transitions in MAPbX3 are avoided. Furthermore, it is more self-contained without being affected external influences such as temperature field issues.
Using broadband transient reflectance (TR) spectroscopy, Yang et al.105 investigated the carrier dynamics at the surface of CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite single crystals (Fig. 15a). The following operations were used to create single crystals of CH3NH3PbBr3. PbBr2 and CH3NH3Br were dissolved in DMF solvent. The combined solution was slightly heated to produce a translucent solution. Then, 2 mL of this solution was put into an inner vial, which was placed within a larger outer vial containing toluene. Finally, the exterior vial was securely sealed. Toluene diffused slowly from the outer vial into the inner vial, and the crystallization process was kept in a dark, undisturbed atmosphere for at least three days. Consequently, single orange block-shaped crystals were obtained. Bakr et al. presented an antisolvent vapor-assisted crystallization method for producing large crack-free MAPbX3 single crystals with volumes surpassing 100 mm3 (Fig. 15b).67 To prepare the precursor solution, PbBr2 and MABr powders were dissolved in DMF. Then, the solution and dichloromethane (DCM) were sealed and kept in a closed vessel. Because DCM and DMF mix well, DCM will slowly evaporate and its vapor will diffuse into the precursor solution. DCM diffusion in DMF consumes some of the DMF solvent. Because PbBr2 and MABr cannot be dissolved in DCM, the consumption of DMF by DCM increases the concentrations of MABr and PbBr2 in the solution, resulting in the production of MAPbBr3 crystals. Gao et al. also used a solution-processed antisolvent growth approach to create high-quality methylammonium lead bromide perovskite single crystals (Fig. 15c).88 In a tiny vial, PbBr2 and MABr were dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide solution. Then, the vial was sealed with foil, but with a tiny opening to allow dichloromethane to slowly enter. To precipitate the single crystals, DCM was used as an antisolvent. Finally, the vial was placed in a DCM environment for two days, during which the MAPbBr3 single crystal developed slowly. Subsequently, the huge crystal was sliced into tiny crystals with an average size of 7 mm × 7 mm × 3.5 mm. Bakr et al.106 improved on the method reported by Wei et al. to generate high-quality MAPbBr3. They discovered that the single crystals formed with a molar ratio of 1.0 of lead bromide (PbBr2)/methylamine bromine (MABr) progressively changed from transparent to opaque using this procedure. This is due to the significant variation in the solubility of MABr and PbBr2 in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (PbBr2 has much lower solubility than MABr). After the antisolvent consumed the majority of the DMF solvent, PbBr2 precipitated quicker than MABr, potentially resulting in non-stoichiometric MAPbBr3 or surface contaminants. Because of their different solubilities in DMF, it was challenging to get high-quality MAPbBr3 with a 1:1 mole ratio of MABr and PbBr2. Thus, they employed a molar ratio of 0.8 to overcome this problem (there was always more MABr in the solution). A molar ratio of 0.8 for PbBr2 and MABr provided high-quality crystals with increased carrier mobility and lifespan. This resulted in the formation of transparent single crystals with diameters in the range of 1–6 mm (Fig. 15d). Zhou et al.90 investigated antisolvent diffusion-induced growth (ASDI) and the equilibrium of organometallic trihalide perovskite (OTP) single crystals (Fig. 15e and f). For the crystal growth of CH3NH3PbI3, HI was added to a 50 mL round-bottom flask. The liquid was degassed by flowing a stream of nitrogen through it for 1 min and keeping it under a nitrogen atmosphere throughout the experiment. PbI2 was dissolved in HI solution after heating the flask to 120 °C in an oil bath, resulting in a brilliant yellow solution. Solid CH3NH3I was added to the hot yellow solution and dissolved rapidly. The solution was allowed to cool to room temperature once stirring was stopped. Then, the solution was poured into a cuvette. The antisolvent gently poured into the cuvette along the cuvette wall. The cuvette was left to develop a single crystal at ambient temperature. Finally, diethyl ether was used to clean the single crystal. Rong et al. used a simple antisolvent vapor-assisted crystallization approach to prepare the B-site doping of an MAPbBr3 single crystal with erbium (Er) (Fig. 15g).89 Compared to the undoped sample, the Er-doped MAPbBr3 single crystal displayed dramatically improved photoluminescence (PL) and photoconductivity. Antisolvent vapor-assisted crystallization (AVC) was used to generate the single crystals. In summary, MABr and PbBr2 were totally dissolved in DMF. Then, the fluid was filtered using a polytetrafluoroethylene syringe filter with a pore size of 0.2 μm. The filtered precursor solution was placed in a container containing dichloromethane (DCM). For roughly 24 h, the single crystals produced in the DCM environment diffused into the precursor solution. Then, the single crystals were washed with DCM and vacuum-dried for at least 10 h. To prepare Er-MAPbBr3 single crystals, an ErCl3 stock solution was added to the perovskite precursor solution at a 1% Er/Pb ratio, while the remaining steps remained the same.

4.1.1.4 Slow evaporation crystallization (SEC). 
Slow evaporation is a straightforward and classic approach for creating single crystals in solution growth methods, which is also utilized to create the majority of organic crystals used for single crystal structure research.
Nandi et al.92 established a novel method for producing MAPbCl3 single crystals at room temperature without the need for an antisolvent. The solvent employed was a combination of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), in which lead(II) chloride (PbCl2) and methylammonium chloride (MACl) were dissolved, and the precursor solution was held at room temperature without being disturbed. At room temperature, DMSO vaporized significantly quicker and guides the reaction mixture to a more antisolvent contained state, finally leading to the development of rectangle-shaped (8 × 5 × 1 mm3), extremely transparent, colorless, and high-quality MAPbCl3 single crystals (Fig. 16a) within four weeks. Xiong et al. investigated the crystal growth, crystal structures and properties of hybrid perovskite analogue (benzylammonium)2PbCl4 materials.87Fig. 16b displays a schematic illustration of the crystal growth under a specific temperature. Briefly, (benzylammonium)2PbCl4 single crystals were synthesised using a stoichiometric mixture of benzylammonium chloride and PbCl2 in a concentrated HCl aqueous solution. However, bulk crystals with a dimension of 5 × 10 × 2 mm3 were obtained by slow evaporation of an N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution at 90 °C. The (benzylammonium)2PbCl4 plate single crystal was elongated along the [001] direction, with the [100] facet being the largest, as confirmed by the XRD pattern. The experimental results of the single crystal, as shown in Fig. 16b, were consistent with the simulated morphology of (benzylammonium)2PbCl4. However, although this approach is incredibly efficient and adaptable, it has certain drawbacks. For example, it can be difficult to accurately control, limiting its application.

4.1.1.5 Bridgman growth method. 
The melt crystal growth method, particularly the Bridgman growth method, is commonly utilized for the production of large-size crystals in sealed ampoules. Because of the high vapour pressure and chemical instability of organic compounds at melting temperatures, the melt growth technique should only be used for organic–inorganic compounds having a known melting point. The Bridgman growth process may produce huge crystals that are only limited by the size of the crystallization ampoules. However, the interfaces between the crystal and the ampoule can cause stress, fissures, or microscopic grain boundaries in the crystals.
This technique should enable the preparation of hybrid perovskite materials with a fixed melt point, such as MASnX3 (X = Cl, Br, and I). Kanatzidis et al. used the vertical Bridgman technique to grow CsPbBr3 single crystals.93 CsPbBr3 was prepared by either reacting equimolar quantities of CsBr and PbBr2 in a sealed fused silica ampule at 600 °C or combining equimolar solutions of PbBr2 and CsBr in concentrated aqueous hydrobromic acid. The vertical Bridgman technique was used to develop a 7 mm-diameter crystal ingot in a three-zone furnace at a translation speed of 10.0 mm h−1 for a specific temperature profile. Typically, charged CsPbBr3 was placed in a fused silica ampule with a 9 mm outer diameter and sealed at 10−4 mbar. The differential thermal analysis (DTA) studies revealed that the compound melts at ∼567 °C and crystallizes at ∼514 °C. CsPbBr3 was produced utilizing commercially available 5N grade PbBr2 (CsPbBr3-1) and freshly precipitated and dried PbBr2 in two independently grown crystal batches (CsPbBr3-2) (Fig. 16c). The modified vertical Bridgman technique was used by Song et al. to grow a 25 cm3-volume all-inorganic perovskite CsPbBr3 single crystal (Fig. 16e).107 The growth set-up is presented in Fig. 16d. The CsPbBr3 single crystal ingot with a volume of 25 cm3 was created utilizing a four-zone furnace employing the modified Bridgman process, and it was easily cut into wafers for use in different optoelectronic devices. CsPbBr3 single crystals were created by combining equal parts of CsBr and PbBr2 in a fused silica ampoule. To enable an adequate and uniform reaction, a CsPbBr3 seed was first generated in a rocking furnace. Subsequently, the ampule was withdrawn from the four-zone Bridgman furnace for single crystal growth. The furnace temperature was increased to 60°, which is much higher than the melting point of the generated crystal. When the temperature fluctuated irregularly, a higher temperature resulted in a concave solid–liquid (S–L) interface with inclusions at the bottom. Thus, by changing the furnace temperature and seeding location, an S–L interface that was slightly convex toward the melt with a temperature gradient in the range of 50 °C cm−1 to 70 °C cm−1 was created.


4.1.2 Large-size single-crystal thin films. 
As seen above, there are several straightforward methods to grow and synthesize bulk single crystals. However, their large active layer may result in an increase in charge recombination, resulting in a decrease in device performance. Furthermore, the bulk shape of perovskite single crystals makes practical device applications difficult. In this case, developing thin perovskite single crystals with a wide area is an excellent strategy for overcoming the aforementioned limitations, and therefore advancing manufacturing for further practical applications. Thus, to improve the device performance, the manufacturing of perovskite single-crystal thin films is extremely desirable and exciting. Thin perovskite single crystals originally emerged as polycrystalline films, which have now been manufactured into monocrystal films using a variety of techniques. However, because of their volatile, delicate organic components and brittle inorganic framework, single-crystal thin films are difficult to deposit in solution. In this case, although the geometries of single-crystal thin films differ from that of bulk single crystals, the procedures for their growth are similar.
The manufacturing processes for perovskite large-size single-crystal thin films are thoroughly covered in this section. These techniques can be categorized into three groups, i.e., top-down techniques, vapor-phase epitaxial techniques, and solution-based lateral crystal growth techniques. Also, a summary of the comprehensive descriptions, including the thickness, size and other important parameters is provided in Table 1.
4.1.2.1 Solution-based growth of perovskite large-size single-crystal thin films. 
The method most often used to grow perovskite large-size single-crystal thin films is solution-processed crystallization. This procedure typically consists of two steps, i.e., crystal nucleation and growth.
To employ the best technique for the formation of perovskite single-crystal thin films, it is vital to comprehend the nucleation and growth mechanism. In particular, the development of nucleation sites, which always takes place in a supersaturated solution by changing the temperature and increasing the concentration, is the first step in the crystallization process. The nucleation rate is related to the number of nuclei and is often governed by the degree of supersaturation, which is particularly noteworthy. The degree of supersaturation needs to be carefully regulated to produce a large-area single crystal given that too many nuclei invariably results in small-size crystals. Following the initial nucleation creation, the crystals gradually grow. Importantly, the feed ratios of the precursors,108 mineralizers,109 and solvents can be used to regulate the anisotropic growth rates in the lateral and vertical axes, enabling construction of the appropriate single-crystal thin films.110 However, in most instances (particularly for 3D perovskites), the anisotropic growth rates are inadequate, leading to the creation of bulk single crystals with low proportions. Luckily, the introduction of a geometric space-confined approach can effectively overcome these issues and make it possible to manufacture perovskite single-crystal thin films. This tactic can be carried out via inverse temperature crystallization,81 temperature-lowering crystallization,111 antisolvent vapor-assisted crystallization,67 and slow evaporation crystallization, as shown in Fig. 17.87,112

4.1.2.1.1 Inverse temperature crystallization (ITC). 
A complex was created by the molecular binding of perovskites and solvent, which broke down into free perovskite molecules as the temperature increased.113 Consequently, heating a perovskite-precursor solution with the appropriate concentration will cause inverse temperature crystallization to occur. Significantly, this type of crystallization causes materials to crystallize at a rate that is orders of magnitude quicker than that of conventional solution-phase techniques. Due to its straightforward process and quick crystallization rate, this approach is a common one for producing perovskite single-crystals.71 In addition, inverse temperature crystallization has been extensively employed to create perovskite single-crystal thin films by using two parallel plates to restrain crystal formation in the z-direction with a regulated thickness (Fig. 17a).
Using a dynamic flow microreactor system, Liu et al. prepared geometry-controlled ultrathin perovskite single crystal wafers.64 They used an ultrathin, geometry-defined dynamic-flow reaction system to build the CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal wafer, which was put in a flat container, as shown in Fig. 18a. A peristaltic pump was used to produce dynamic flow, which ensured crystal formation with a continual fresh solution. Based on the inverse temperature crystallization of perovskites in the solvent of γ-butyrolactone (GBL), in which the fresh solution concentration was regulated, a variety of thickness-regulated perovskite single crystal wafers were successfully produced using this basic process (Fig. 18c–j). Perovskite single-crystal thin films that are directly produced on certain substrates are preferred for vertically structured optoelectronic devices over unsupported single crystals. Chen et al. described a simple space-confined solution-processed approach for the on-substrate growth of different hybrid perovskite single-crystal thin films (SCTFs) with customizable thicknesses ranging from nanometers to micrometers,114 with an aspect ratio of up to ∼105. This method allowed the formation of different perovskite SCTFs on the substrate. Two clean flat surfaces were clipped together, and then vertically dipped in a perovskite precursor solution, as shown schematically in Fig. 18h. To regulate the evaporation rate of the solvent, the bottom precursor solution was heated. Following top-seeded solution-growth (TSSG), the bottom solution remained saturated, but the top solution film became supersaturated due to the colder temperature, causing perovskite crystallization in the clipped solution film. Two 1.8 × 1.8 mm glass slides were clipped together to hold the two surfaces together. In DMF, DMSO, and GBL, 0.7 M, 2.0 M, and 1.23 M precursor solutions of PbBr2/MABr, PbCl2/MACl, and PbI2/MAI were produced, respectively. The bromide and chloride solutions were prepared at ambient temperature, while the iodide solution was heated to 60 °C. Then, the clipped substrates were vertically dipped into each precursor solution in a 50 mL beaker. The beaker was heated to 90 °C for bromide and 100 °C for chloride and iodide, respectively. The substrates containing perovskite SCTFs were transported to a vacuum oven for additional solvent removal after 24–36 h for bromide and 48–60 h for chloride and iodide, respectively. SEM scans (Fig. 18b) of several perovskite SCTFs grown on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) revealed a flat thin film with a consistent form and a size of hundreds of micrometers. The magnified SEM image, as shown in Fig. 18b, revealed angled facets and smooth surfaces, as well as the absence of apparent grain boundaries and voids. Unfortunately, the lateral diameters of the single-crystal thin films were too tiny (just a few hundred micrometers) to be used in the manufacturing of devices.

Rao et al. first established an inventive space-limited inverse temperature crystallization (SLITC) approach for the in situ preparation of a 120 cm2 large-area CH3NH3PbBr3 crystal film on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass.115Fig. 19a depicts a sandwich-typed module designed for the formation of CH3NH3PbBr3 crystal films. The main idea is to construct a tight gap to limit the lateral expansion of the perovskite crystal, resulting in size and thickness-regulated growth. A mixed solution of HBr and CH3NH2 was produced and stirred for 2 h in an ice-water bath, and then crystallized by low-pressure distillation. The crude product was refined via recrystallization with diethyl ether and vacuum drying. The photographs of the CH3NH3PbBr3 crystals taken at various growth times showed that the perovskite single crystals grew predominantly from the higher temperature zone (bottom), then got bigger, and ultimately covered the entire limiting space, relying on renewing the precursor solution and lengthening the growth time. After 7 days of growth, a continuous 120 cm2 CH3NH3PbBr3 planar crystal layer with no fractures was produced in situ on FTO glass using the SLITC technique (Fig. 19b), as seen in the magnified image of the bottom and top crystals in Fig. 19c and d, respectively. Also, they intricately built another intriguing module (Fig. 19e), which was based on a large lateral size (6 × 8 mm), and much thinner (16 μm) laminar CH3NH3PbBr3 single-crystal films (Fig. 19f) were successfully realized down to tens of micrometers.116 A peristaltic pump was used in the well-designed module and produce a circulating flow of the precursor solution (MABr and PbBr2 in DMF). To achieve large-area single-crystal thin films, a consistent flow of new solution could refill the depleted perovskite precursor, enabling ongoing crystal formation. The two glass substrates were also sealed with an ultrathin polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) box, which had an important influence on the thickness of the resulting perovskite single-crystal thin films. The nucleation location was constrained and the number of crystal nuclei was simultaneously adjusted by local heating at 90 °C at the center of the glass substrate. Yu et al. developed a spatially-confined inverse temperature crystallization approach to produce micrometer-thin single crystals of methylammonium lead halide perovskites MAPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I).117 The single crystal enabled conformal growth on flat and pre-patterned surfaces with good adherence because the confinement template restricted the top and bottom facets of the crystal. This method paves the way for the fabrication of hybrid perovskite semiconductor-based electrical devices and circuits and addresses the significant integration challenges associated with using perovskite single crystals in devices requiring lateral charge transfer. Their approach advances thin single crystal (TSC) construction by restricting the starting solution between two substrates, one or both of which can be prepatterned with electrodes separated by a fixed spacer designed to regulate the thickness, contact quality, and encourage lateral development. To obtain satisfactory adhesion, a 2.5 μm-thick polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film was employed as a spacer between two glass slides and melted at 270 °C. The perovskite ink was pulled via capillary forces after being introduced between the two surfaces. Two PET strips with a lateral separation of several millimeters were glued to the substrate. The superstrate was put on top, and the sandwiched stack was heated on a hot plate to 270 °C for 5 min to melt the PET and assist the substrate and superstrate bind. After cooling, the substrates were moved to a nitrogen glove box. To create the precursor solution in the glove box, the hybrid perovskite MAPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) was resolved in 1 M solutions of DMF, DMF, and GBL, respectively. Then, a tiny volume of precursor solution was injected near the sandwich edge, where it was pulled and distributed into the gap by capillary force. In the case of MAPbCl3, MAPbBr3, and MAPbI3, the crystal formation was accomplished by putting the stack on a hot plate and annealing at a fixed temperature of 60 °C (2 days), 80 °C (2 days), and 100 °C (3 days), respectively.

An MAPbBr3 single-crystal thin film was fabricated using the inverse temperature crystallization method, which has been widely demonstrated as a universal process for the preparation of various bulk halide-perovskite single crystals. However, it is difficult to apply this method to grow narrow-bandgap iodine-based single-crystal thin films (such as MAPbI3). According to the research by Yue et al.,118 the challenges in producing MAPbI3 single-crystal films resulted from the high nucleation-energy barrier caused by the different solubilities of MAI and PbI2 in GBL. Accordingly, to overcome this difficulty, MAPbI3 seed crystals were introduced in the constrained area to overcome the nucleation barrier. Through the inverse temperature crystallization process, MAPbI3 single-crystal thin films with thicknesses of 50 μm and lateral dimensions of up to 2 mm were produced.118
To accomplish preferred growth in the lateral direction at the solution-air interface, Bakr et al. devised a surface tension-controlled inverse temperature crystallization approach.113 Surface-tension effects caused the intermolecular distances in the surface layer to increase, which lowered the associated molecular interaction energies, as seen in Fig. 19g. Consequently, because of the lower nucleation barrier at the surface layer compared to the solution volume, the rate of lateral growth at the solution surface is greater than the rate of vertical growth (Fig. 19h and i). Solvents with a high surface tension coefficient, such as DMSO (δDMSO = 42.8 8 mN m−1. δDMF = 35.2 mN m−1, were used to dissolve the perovskite precursors to promote more favorable surface nucleation (such as MABr and PbBr2 for MAPbBr3). Consequently, several perovskite single-crystal thin films including MAPbBr3, MAPbI3, and MASnBr3 with surface areas of up to 1 cm2 and thicknesses of 5–20 μm were created at the solvent surface.
4.1.2.1.2 Solution temperature-lowering (STL) crystallization. 
Perovskite becomes less soluble in a hydrohalic acid aqueous solution as the solution temperature drops.72,119 Multiple perovskite single-crystals have been created using this common approach.120–122 Perovskite single-crystal thin films may also be grown using a space-confining method to regulate the crystal thickness (Fig. 17b). The 2D network of corner-sharing BX6 octahedral layers are contained between the interdigitating bilayers of intercalated bulky alkylammonium cations in the developing 2D Ruddlesden–Popper-type perovskites.123 These perovskites are regarded as prime prospects for next-generation optoelectronics due to their properties, including strong chemical stability, optoelectronic tunability, and numerous quantum well architectures.124 For instance, a quasi-2D (C4H9NH3)2(CH3NH3)2Pb3I10 single-crystal thin film was obtained by gradually lowering the temperature of a saturated solution (with stoichiometric amounts of C4H9NH3I, PbI2, and CH3NH3I in HI aqueous solution), which was located between two non-wetting substrates, controlled from 130 °C to room temperature (Fig. 20a and b).125 The non-wetting substrates could enhance the long-range ionic transport along the confined space due to the reduced drag force of the solvent molecules, resulting in a large lateral size of ≈4 mm. Another temperature-lowering crystallization process, together with surface-tension control, was reported to achieve perovskite single-crystal thin films at the solution–air interface. By gradually cooling a hot, saturated aqueous solution, Wang et al. generated free-standing, inch-scale quasi-2D single-crystal ((C4H9NH3)n(CH3NH3)n−1PbnI3n+1 (index n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and ∞)) thin films at the solution surface. At the solution-air interface, the C4H9NH4+ precursor cations spontaneously self-assembled and served as a soft template to direct the formation of the underlying nanostructures (Fig. 20e and f).124 Higher chemical potentials were delivered by the increased precursor molecule solvation energy at the asymmetric solution–air interface, which lowered the energy barrier and speeds up in-plane growth (Fig. 20g and h). Consequently, inch-sized freestanding single-crystal thin films with enormous aspect ratios of 104, ranging from 2D and quasi-2D to 3D perovskite, were produced.

Liu et al. used induced peripheral crystallization to create large-area flexible phenylethylamine lead iodide (C6H5C2H4NH3)2PbI4 single-crystalline membranes (SCM). It was discovered that the current photosensor had a very high external quantum efficiency (EQE).126Fig. 20c depicts the induced peripheral crystallization (IPC) growth method. Fig. 20d shows five pictures of (PEA)2PbI4 SCMs at various growth phases. To prepare the (PEA)2PbI4 precursor solution, PbI2 and C6H5C2H4NH3I were dissolved in γ-butyrolactone (GBL) for 24 h at 80 °C with vigorous mixing. Prior to crystal formation, the solution was filtered. To grow the (PEA)2PbI4 SCM, a drop of the produced precursor solution was pipetted on an 80 °C glass slide substrate, which was then covered by a second glass slide with decreased lateral dimensions. The solution was pressed to be uniformly distributed across the two slides, and then maintained in a closed oven at a temperature of 80 °C. Nucleation and crystallization occurred near the top edge of the slide in around 2 h. After further gradient cooling from 80 °C to 30 °C at a rate of 1 °C h−1, the (PEA)2PbI4 SCM grew between slides. The precursor was produced at 80 °C with a concentration of (PEA)2PbI4 in GBA to provide an unsaturated solution devoid of particles, which may function as nucleation seeds to inhibit crystallite development in solution. The perovskite crystallites grew on the edge of the second slide, and then expanded inside the slit until it was completely filled.
4.1.2.1.3 Solvent evaporation crystallization. 
After increasing the concentration to the critical point of saturation, a traditional way to induce crystallization is solvent evaporation. However, this process is time-consuming and challenging to correctly manage.87,127 Two plates are often required for spatial confinement in the solvent evaporation crystallization process to produce single-crystal thin films (Fig. 17c). Crystallization occurs as the precursor solution progressively volatilizes in the tiny space between the plates. Thus, the rate of solvent evaporation, which is challenging to manage, determines the crystallization rate.
Early in 2016, Yanagi's team developed a straightforward “cast-capping” technique to create MAPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) single-crystal thin films.128–130 Specifically, an MAPbX3 solution was first cast on a glass substrate, and then it was covered with an additional glass substrate. Between the two substrates, single-crystal thin films were created as the solvent progressively volatilized at ambient temperature. The produced MAPbX3 single-crystal thin films had micrometer-scale thicknesses and lateral widths in the range of hundreds of micrometers. However, the thin films presented an irregular form. In this case, increasing the temperature of the substrate can address the issue that solvent evaporation naturally occurs at room temperature is rather slow and undesirable for large-scale synthesis. Using the solvent evaporation crystallization technique, Huang et al. recently reported the synthesis of (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 (FA = CH(NH2)2+) single-crystal thin sheets at higher temperatures (80 °C).131 These single-crystal thin sheets have lateral diameters between 500 μm and 2 mm, and their thicknesses range from 10 to 50 micrometers.
The production of a continuous uniform perovskite wafer-scale single-crystal thin film is highly expected but difficult, in contrast to the discrete single crystals with restricted areas that are frequently produced via spatially constrained solution techniques. Lee et al. described a simple roll-printing approach for the preparation of large-scale CH3NH3PbI3 single-crystal thin films using geometrically constrained lateral crystal growth (GC-LCG), as depicted in Fig. 21b.132 The suggested approach involved transferring a perovskite ink solution to a heated substrate using a channel-patterned rolling mould to promote immediate crystallization and lateral crystal development under geometrical constraint. The noteworthy aspect of this approach is that the feeding solution instantly crystallizes under geometrical confinement, resulting in unidirectional lateral crystal growth. Consequently, highly aligned single-crystal thin films (3 × 3 inches) could be created. Firstly, the roller is put in contact with the hot SiO2 substrate (180 °C), while equipped with an ink supply loaded with the CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution. Then, the perovskite ink solution is rapidly crystallized at the open end of the channels due to immediate solvent evaporation produced by the heated substrate, as seen in Fig. 21c. Seed crystals can grow quickly on the substrate via immediate crystallization with an adequate mould rolling speed. Because the deposited ink solution is vertically contained between the substrate and the shallow channels of the mould, the crystal growth in the vertical direction is limited. The GC-LCG of the perovskite ink solution happens when the mould rolls, as shown in Fig. 21d. Lateral crystal development with geometrical restriction efficiently eliminates the seed crystal misalignment. Consequently, CH3NH3PbI3 single-crystal thin films with a tetragonal crystal structure were effectively prepared using the GC-LCG technique (Fig. 21e).

Secondly, the prepared seed stamp is covered on the target substrate with perovskite solution, and perovskite single-crystal films grow in situ as the solvent dries. Taking away the covered stamp, perovskite single-crystal films were printed on the substrate.

(b) Manufacturing procedure for single-crystal perovskite thin films using geometrically confined lateral crystal growth (GC-LCG) with a rolling mould. The perovskite ink solution is geometrically confined between the mould and the substrate; thus, crystal growth is restricted in one direction. By rolling the mould and continuously supplying ink to the substrate, large-area single-crystal perovskite patterned thin films grow along the rolling direction.

Perovskite single-crystal perovskite arranged films are also attractive for photodetector applications in addition to continuous thin films. Gu et al. described a simple seed printing method for creating millimeter-sized perovskite single-crystal films in controlled batches.133 The trick is to inject a perovskite seed stamp into the liquid membrane system, which can dramatically reduce random nucleation and enable accurate crystal growth control. The seed size could be used to customize the film thickness across a wide range. Furthermore, due to the perovskite seed stamp, the single-crystal films can be appropriately transferred to nearly any substrate. This printing technique enables the scalable manufacture of different perovskite devices by controlling the growth of massive perovskite single-crystal films on various substrates. Inkjet printing is a simple process for selectively depositing functional materials and their patterns. Thus, based on this, perovskite solution droplets were selectively placed on a substrate. As the droplets evaporated, patterned perovskite seeds grew on the substrate, specifically the perovskite seed stamp, which was subsequently coated with a saturated perovskite solution on a target substrate. After the solvent dried at room temperature, single-crystal films developed consistently throughout the substrate on the seeds. It was proposed that the controllable growth of perovskite single-crystal films by seed printing at room temperature reflects the dominant role of the perovskite seeds in suppressing random nucleation by influencing mass transport and changing the distribution of perovskite precursor ions in the crystallization system (Fig. 21a). Using this technique, single-crystal films including MAPbBr3, MAPbCl3, MAPbI3, CsPbBr3, and BA2PbBr4 could be successfully prepared.
4.1.2.1.4 Antisolvent vapor-assisted crystallization. 
Normally, antisolvent vapor gradually permeates the perovskite-precursor solution (in DMSO, DMF, GBL, etc.) until the perovskite supersaturate and crystallization is induced. Despite the fact that this technique is frequently used to create large-scale bulk single crystals, it may be expanded to prepare single-crystal thin films by kinetic control or geometrical confinement (Fig. 17d).
Wang et al. described a gas–liquid interface crystalline route for growing BA2PbBr4 (BA = CH3CH2CH2CH2NH3+) large-sized and thin single-crystal films.134 Initially, PbBr2 and BABr are dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and agitated for 2 h to create a homogenous precursor solution. Then, the precursor solution is poured onto a glass disc and put in a tightly sealed container with chlorobenzene. Finally, the container is relocated to a dark and quiet location to eliminate outside disturbance. The crystallization process includes two stages, i.e., nucleation and growth. The supersaturation of the precursor solution is closely related to both the nucleation and growth processes. Fig. 20g depicts the nucleation and growth phases of BA2PbBr4 SCTF. Initially, the chlorobenzene slowly volatilizes and dissolves in the precursor solution to increase the saturation at a slow rate. The nucleation process begins when the saturation of the precursor solution reaches the nucleation energy barrier. Because of the buoyancy and surface tension of the solution, the film will float on the surface and expand at various rates along distinct crystal planes (Fig. 20h). Consequently, Peng et al. were inspired to build hybrid perovskite monocrystalline films on surfaces by using the tendency of the perovskite to crystallize in solution.135 They devised a novel growth technique based on cavitation-triggered asymmetrical crystallization (CTAC), which boosted heterogeneous nucleation by delivering enough energy to break through the nucleation barrier. Fig. 22a–d illustrate the entire CTAC procedure. Control of the film thickness can be further enhanced by accurately manipulating the rate and timing of crystal nucleation and growth, such as the time to introduce sonication, time to introduce post-sonication, and antisolvent engineering. On the surface of diverse substrates, MAPbBr3 monocrystalline films were formed (Fig. 22e and f). To generate monocrystalline films, the entire setup was placed in an ultrasonic bath, and when the perovskite solution reached a low supersaturation level, a brief ultrasonic pulse was initiated. A perovskite precursor solution of equimolar MABr and PbBr2 in DMF was loaded in a Pyrex crystallizing dish, which was subsequently put into a larger crystallizing dish with dichloromethane loaded as the antisolvent. The antisolvent vapor diffused slowly into the perovskite solution. This process cannot be used to create additional halide perovskites and is only capable of producing a (001)-oriented MAPbBr3 single-crystal thin films.

For the formation of perovskite single-crystal thin films, notably for 2D perovskites, antisolvent vapor diffusion crystallization in a small area is also suitable. Lédée et al. described a novel flexible approach termed “antisolvent vapor-assisted capping crystallization” (AVCC) for the synthesis of single crystals of (C6H5C2H4NH3)2PbI4 (named PEPI) in 30 min.136 Initially, PEPI crystals were placed on a clean quartz substrate, soon followed by another quartz substrate. Finally, in a larger Teflon cap vial, a tiny vial of dichloromethane (DCM) was put on top of the two substrates. After a few minutes, rectangle-shaped crystals were formed in the space between the two quartz substrates. During the first two hours, the crystals developed at an amazing pace of roughly 2 mm2 h−1. Then, it was slowed down to around 0.5 mm2 h−1 for the next few hours. When the crystals were allowed to grow, they reached one centimeter in length. To generate high-quality, large-area, and small-thickness single-crystal films and achieve efficient photoelectric performance, Chen et al.137 described the formation of CsPbBr3 single-crystal films with anisotropy ratios as high as 105, with thicknesses ranging from 90 to 850 nm and lateral sizes approaching centimeters (see Fig. 20i). It has been highlighted that the AVCC approach can be applied to a variety of substrates, including quartz, ITO, silicon, and silicon/silicon dioxide. The surface morphology of the CsPbBr3 single-crystal film that was applied to an SiO2/Si substrate is shown in Fig. 20j. Also, it was demonstrated that the CsPbBr3 single-crystal film may grow anisotropically when the precursor concentration, reaction temperature, and surfactant are tuned.
4.1.2.2 Vapor-phase epitaxial growth. 
In vapor-phase epitaxy, the vapor-phase precursors react and develop into a single-crystal thin film after being delivered through a carrier gas to a monocrystalline substrate at the right temperature. It has been shown that vapor-phase epitaxial growth is an effective method for growing high-quality single-crystal thin films, particularly for common group IV, III–V, and II–VI semiconductors.138 The preparation of ultrathin single-crystal thin films with thicknesses as low as the monolayer level and exceptional phase purity is possible due to this intriguing epitaxial growing process.139 Nevertheless, the use of perovskite materials in the preparation of single-crystal thin films is hampered by the requirement of high temperatures and matching lattice constants and expansion coefficients with that of the substrate.
Due to their comparable material chemistries and lattice constants, Shi's group discovered that monocrystalline alkali halides can serve as universal substrates for the vapor-phase epitaxial development of inorganic halide perovskite single-crystal thin films (Fig. 23a).140 This technique could enable the production of centimeter-scale CsPbBr3 single-crystal thin films with excellent crystallization quality (Fig. 23b), such as flat surfaces and uniform thickness. Subsequently, Jin's team used the vapor-phase epitaxial technique to successfully grow continuous CsPbBr3 single-crystal thin films with adjustable micrometer-scale thicknesses on the (100) face of conventional oxide perovskite SrTiO3 substrates.141 Although the SrTiO3 substrate and CsPbBr3 have very different lattice constants, two unit cells of CsPbBr3 may align with three unit cells of SrTiO3 with a very low lattice misfit factor (Fig. 23c), making it a possible alternative substrate for CsPbBr3 epitaxial growth. A high reaction temperature (450 °C) promotes atomic diffusion during the heteroepitaxial growth process, thereby increasing the nucleation density and further facilitating the creation of large-area continuous thin films. On the (100) face of 5 × 10 mm SrTiO3 substrates, a large-area continuous CsPbBr3 single-crystal thin film with good single crystallinity and crystal orientation could be easily formed, and the thickness could be changed by adjusting the growth time (Fig. 23d). It is anticipated that superior all-inorganic perovskite single-crystal thin films will provide access to a wide range of high-performance and stable optoelectronic applications.

4.1.2.3 Top-down method. 
Although the aforementioned bottom-up techniques (such as solution growth and vapor-phase epitaxial growth methods) have greatly advanced the synthesis of perovskite single-crystal thin films, it is still difficult to develop a universal synthetic technique that can be used to create various perovskite single-crystal thin films. It is encouraging to see that the top-down method of cutting thick wafers into big crystals has been proven to be a trustworthy, manageable, and adaptable way to build conventional semiconductor single-crystal films.142
Consequently, Liu's group cut bulk perovskite single-crystals into wafers, including FAPbI3 and MAPbI3.143,144 They concluded that compared to other methods such as laser cutting, inner-circle slicing, and multiwire slicing, diamond-wire sawing (as shown in Fig. 24a) is the most suitable.143 Finally, employing diamond wire, it was possible to prepare single-crystal wafers of FAPbI3 and MAPbI3 with diameters of more than 20 mm and thicknesses as low as about 100 μm, as illustrated in Fig. 24b and d. Even if the perovskite single-crystal wafers can be mechanically polished to be even thinner, when their thickness is less than 200 μm, fragmentation can occur simultaneously.145 Yan's team suggested an all-encompassing technique that further reduces the thickness by combining wire cutting, mechanical polishing, and wet etching.145 Wet etching was carried out in the unsaturated mother liquor, as shown in Fig. 24e, and by modifying the immersion duration, temperature, and concentration of the etching solution, the thickness of the resulting single-crystal film decreased to 15 μm, while preserving an area of over 10 mm2. This slicing technique made it simple to control and manufacture 3D perovskite single-crystal thin films, but the associated mechanical polishing or etching operations may result in surface flaws, significant material loss (up to 50%), and a large amount of residue.144

The preparation of perovskite single-crystal thin films via mechanical exfoliation has numerous inherent benefits, including a single reaction phase, homogeneous surface, and no grain boundaries or pin-holes. However, the provided single-crystal thin film has a very tiny area, which is not beneficial for further applications, and this technique shows low repeatability.

4.2 Lead-free perovskites single-crystal growth techniques
In general, perovskite single crystals and nanocrystals are manufactured using a variety of low-cost solution-processing methods. The development of easy-to-grow procedures for perovskite structures enables the fabrication of low-cost, high-efficiency devices. However, the toxicity of the Pb atom and the instability of perovskite structures prevent these technologies from being commercialized further. Presently, the toxicity of these lead-based perovskites has become a major obstacle, limiting their widespread development. Consequently, research into alternative classes of lead-free perovskites for optoelectronic applications is critical. Recent efforts have switched to the discovery of innovative, eco-friendly, and stable lead-free metal halide perovskite (LFHP) materials as well as the investigation of their various growth techniques for device applications. Recently, LFHP materials have demonstrated potential for application in a range of optoelectronic devices, and their development thus far has been outstanding. To achieve total control of perovskite single crystals in terms of their form, size, and dimensionality as well as their optical and electrical characteristics, a great deal of effort has recently been devoted to developing trustworthy synthetic techniques. It is crucial to develop standardized synthetic processes for producing large-sized and high-quality perovskite single crystals within an ideal time frame given that quantity and quality yield essentially define usefulness in research and industrial applications.112,146 Here, we examine the current developments in the growth of LFHP single crystals in this area and focus on several of the most commonly used synthesis processes.

4.2.1 Slow evaporation crystallization (SEC). 
In solution growth procedures, the classic and popular solution evaporation (SE) approach is utilized to extract single crystals from materials that are air-stable. This is based on the idea that certain solutions easily evaporate solvents at ambient temperature. Up to the saturation point, two or more reactants are combined in a suitable solvent to create the initial solution, which is then allowed to rest in a perforated-cap vial for evaporation without being disturbed. Although this technique has been utilized to grow the majority of organic single crystals for structural investigation, the synthesis of Pb-free perovskite single crystals has also been added to the scope of this method. Lyu et al. reported the preparation of MA3Bi2I9 single crystals by gradually evaporating a methanol solution of BiI3 and CH3NH3I (1.5:1) overnight at room temperature.147 Despite the fact that BiI3 and CH3NH3I are not very soluble in methanol, gradual and controlled evaporation of their saturated solution produced a single crystal with a size of less than one millimeter. A novel family of bismuth-based organohalides (phenethylammonium cation, C8H12N+, PEA+) single crystals was also prepared by Ghasemi and colleagues.148 By combining PEA-halide and Bi-halide in anhydrous methanol, three different types of single crystals were created, including (PEA)3Bi2I9, (PEA)3Bi2Br9, and (PEA)4Bi2Cl10. The translucent solution was kept in a glass vial with a parafilm lid that was perforated. Consequently, single crystals were formed on the inside wall of the vial as the solvent progressively evaporated. One of them, (PEA)3Bi2I9, demonstrated an exceptionally high performance in optoelectronic devices together with good temperature and moisture stability.
Layered (NH4)3Bi2I9 single crystals were produced using the same SE procedure and a continual cooling mechanism.149 The high crystalline quality was achieved by preventing a large amount of nucleation using a closed heating oven without disturbance. After 5 days of growth, a single crystal with a size reaching 21 mm × 20 mm × 7 mm was produced. Zhang et al. used a low temperature solution technique to grow Cs3Bi2I9 bulk single crystals (Fig. 25a).150 The growth operations were conducted in three distinct steps, which included heating the precursor to saturation, accomplishing nucleation and growth under controlled temperature reduction, and ultimately growing the crystal via solvent volatilization. By carefully adjusting the temperature of the hotplate and the amount of holes in the foil cover, the growth rate was perfectly tailored. Fig. 25b depicts a typical Cs3Bi2I9 crystal with a hexagonal close-packed lattice that was formed using this technique. The dislocation growth mechanism and high growth rate are responsible for the many visible growth steps observed on the rough surface. Cu-based perovskite single crystals are uncommon, and there have been few reports of perovskite structures. Due to their thermochromic and magnetic characteristics, Cu-based perovskites have previously been examined as possible options for lead-free perovskite photovoltaics, Li+ ion batteries, and Heisenberg ferromagnets. In contrast to lead-based perovskites, this novel material shows strong chemical and light stability. Hu et al. used a simple evaporation approach to create a (CH3NH3)2CuCl4 single crystal from an aqueous CuCl2 solution containing CH3NH3Cl salts.48 Peng et al. reported a novel lead-free Cu(I)-based organic–inorganic perovskite of (MA)4Cu2Br6 single crystal with a zero-dimensional (0D) cluster, consisting of two connected tetrahedrons.151 The recently discovered crystal structure of (MA)4Cu2Br6 significantly differs from that of all-inorganic Cu(I)-based (Fig. 25e). The (MA)4Cu2Br6 single crystal was synthesized using a slow evaporation approach from solution in a glovebox. Typically, MABr and CuBr were dissolved in DMF and agitated for 4 h at 50 °C until no particles could be seen in the solvent. Subsequently, a polytetrafluoroethylene syringe was used to filter the mixed solution, and the filtered solution was injected into vials and sealed with a paraffin film containing tiny pores. After that, the filtered solution was placed on a hot stage at 50 °C for two days to harvest high-quality single crystals with a size of around 12 mm × 2.5 mm.

4.2.2 Solution temperature-lowering (STL). 
Single crystals have historically been grown by reducing the solution temperature, with careful nucleation regime management as the key to obtaining large-size single crystals. Solubility often increases proportionately as the temperature of the system increases. In general, the precipitation from a supersaturated solution happens quickly if the concentration of a component exceeds its solubility. The best time to apply cooling crystallization is when the solubility exhibits a significant relationship with temperature. However, this cannot be applied to all perovskite–insolvent systems. The solution becomes supersaturated until the solute precipitates to the temperature-specific saturation point if the rate of solution cooling exceeds the rate of precipitation.
In the case of the 2D double-perovskite (BA)2CsAgBiBr7, Xu et al. prepared high-quality bulk single crystals with diameters of up to 10 mm × 10 mm × 3 mm (Fig. 25c).152 Stoichiometric amounts of Ag2O (1.5 mmol), Bi2O3 (1.5 mmol), and Cs2CO3 (1.5 mmol) were combined with 10 equivalents of n-butylammonium (15 mmol) in HBr solution to create large-size crystals, in which using the slow cooling method was used from a saturated solution to obtain a distinct 2D multilayered motif. It was demonstrated that the growth kinetics, whether directly or indirectly through a series of chilling phases, are highly dependent on the rate of cooling. Zhang et al. reported the preparation of 3 mm × 3 mm × 3 mm double-perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 single crystals from a supersaturated solution of CsBr, AgBr, and BiBr3, as basic ingredients, dissolved in HBr.153 The solution was heated to 125 °C and maintained for 5 h, and then cooled at a rate of 1 °C per hour to 60 °C, and then 5 °C per hour to room temperature. This was discovered to be the best formula for increasing the large-sized champion single crystals of Cs2AgBiBr6. In another study, the identical single crystals were grown under regulated cooling by using a different growth strategy.154 In this instance, the solution containing the materials was heated to 95 °C initially, and after the precursors were completely dissolved, the temperature was decreased to 85 °C at a rate of 3 °C h−1, and subsequently at a slower pace (0.5 °C h−1) to prevent multinucleation. After nucleation, the temperature was maintained for a further 3–5 h to allow full crystal growth. Then, the temperature was once again decreased for further growth at a pace of 1 °C h−1. To keep the solution in the growth zone, it was discovered that the ideal chilling step should be performed at lower than 3 °C (Fig. 25d, f and g).
By using seed-assisted techniques, in which tiny crystals were used as nucleation sites for the ultimate formation of big and high-quality crystals, the crystal growth was significantly improved. Bi-based halide perovskites have advanced quickly among the many possibilities. Because of their similar electrical structure and near electronegativity, Bi-based halide perovskites are predicted to display semiconducting characteristics equivalent to that of lead-based perovskites. Low-toxicity Bi-based materials will provide several opportunities for the construction of lead-free perovskite optoelectronic devices in this context. In this case, a simple solution procedure was used to create lead-free hybrid perovskite (TMHD)BiBr5 (TMHD = N,N,N,N-tetramethyl-1,6-hexanediammonium). Also, inch-sized high-quality single crystals with dimensions of up to 32 × 24 × 12 mm3 were successfully produced. Furthermore, Ji et al. fabricated a planar photodetector array using a bulk (TMHD)BiBr5 single crystal.155 The (TMHD)BiBr5 compound was synthesized by evaporating aqueous solutions containing TMHD and Bi2O3 in a stoichiometric molar ratio in concentrated HBr solutions. The generated raw ingredients from the solution reaction were purified by serial recrystallization in HBr solutions to create the bulk single crystals. Transparent small crystals with well-defined forms generated spontaneously were carefully chosen as the seed crystals. The clear saturated solution of (TMHD)BiBr5 was filtered and kept 2–3 °C above its saturated temperature for 2 h before the growth began. The selected seed crystals were put in solution when the solution temperature approached saturation. For homogeneity, the seed crystals were kept in the solution slightly above the saturated level prior to crystal growth. As the growth continued, the temperature was reduced at a rate of 0.5 °C d−1. After some days, dark-red and high-quality single crystals with a maximum size of up to 32 × 24 × 12 mm3 were collected (Fig. 26g). Zhang et al. used delayed cooling to create a series of Bi3+-doped lead-free, two-dimensional perovskite PEA2Sn1−xBixBr4+x (x ≪ 1) single crystals.50 Firstly, PEA2SnBr4 was created by combining C6H5CH2CH2NH3Br and SnBr2 with HBr and H3PO2. Subsequently, an appropriate amount of BiBr3 was added to the solution of PEA2Sn1-xBixBr4. The solution was agitated at 120 °C for 1 h until it became transparent, which was then cooled to room temperature and the stirring was stopped, yielding yellow flake-like crystals of PEA2SnBr4 and black flake-like crystals of Bi-doped PEA2SnBr4 (Fig. 26e and f). The general operations described above were carried out under an N2 environment. Finally, the crystals were washed with a minimal amount of dry ethanol and vacuum dried at 60 °C for 12 h.

4.2.3 Top-seeded solution growth (TSSG) method. 
A crystal seed that remains in contact with the top surface of the high-temperature solution was used in the TSSG method, in contrast to the conventional flux approach (Fig. 26h).156 When very high quality yield and total control of crystal size and form are required, the TSSG method is the best option. This is different from the common flux approaches and more traditional Czochralski, floating zone, and flame fusion processes.157 Many studies focused on quantifying the relationship between crystal quality and the growth rate, stirring rate, and crucible parameters. Many organizations utilized this method to create perovskite single crystals starting with MAPbI3 single crystals with diameters in the range of tens of millimeters. The first centimeter-sized MAPbI3 crystals were grown via bottom-seeded solution growth (BSSG), which involves attaching a high-quality seed crystal produced by spontaneous crystallization to the center of a specially designed tray.7 The bulk crystal growth and various crystal morphologies of orthorhombic hybrid perovskites of NH(CH3)3SnX3 (X = Cl, Br) were also reported.91 At room temperature, NH(CH3)3SnCl3 has a layer perovskite structure with the space group of Cmc21 (no. 36). When exposed to air, these crystals exhibit very high stability. Fig. 26c and d show colorless single crystals of NH(CH3)3SnCl3 and NH(CH3)3SnBr3, respectively, produced in a water bath in an ambient environment for roughly a month using the BSSG technique.
Ju et al. prepared stable and centimeter-sized tellurium (Te-based double perovskite MA2TeBr6 single crystals in the Pb-free perovskite family with excellent electronic characteristics (Fig. 26i),156 which were demonstrated to be appropriate for a variety of optoelectronic device applications. Under ambient conditions, Dang et al. used the top-seeded solution growth approach to grow bulk single crystals of cubic CH3NH3SnI3 and CH(NH2)2SnI3 (Fig. 26a and b) by controlling the growth temperature and selecting high-quality seed crystals.59 Both crystals exhibited significant air sensitivity and great thermal stability.
Ju et al. used the top-seeded solution growth (TSSG) method to develop mixed-metal perovskite MAPbxSn1−xBr3 (MA = CH3NH3) single crystals.158 Compared to MAPbBr3 (Fig. 27a) and MASnBr3 (Fig. 27b), the color of the MAPbxSn1−xBr3 single crystals (Fig. 27c–e) was substantially deeper. The combined MAPbxSn1−xBr3 single crystals with large macroscopic diameters (16 mm × 14 mm × 10 mm) displayed good stability when exposed to air. The raw components, which included methylamine hydrochloride (CH5N·HCl), SnO, and PbO, were dissolved in an HBr/H3PO2 mixed solution at 75 °C in the ambient environment and agitated to generate a brilliant yellow solution that was saturated at around 68 °C. Subsequently, the top-seeded solution growth approach was used to generate black and lustrous, huge-sized MAPbxSn1−xBr3 single crystals over a month. By varying the molar ratios of Pb and Sn elements (such as Pb/Sn = 2/1, 1/1, and 1/3), several forms of mixed Pb-Sn perovskite single crystals were effectively obtained. A generic doping technique was also developed to create lead-free and large-sized Sn-doped MA3Sb2I9 single crystals.159 After 24 h hydrothermal treatment at 220 °C, the black and lustrous large-size MA3Sb2I9 single crystals as well as Sn-doped MA3Sb2I9 single crystals were produced (Fig. 27f–i).

However, there are a number of drawbacks associated with this approach. Firstly, the extremely low solubilities lead to extremely slow growth rates, hindering its extensive use. It normally takes more than two weeks to get large-size crystals. Some studies have been done on how to modify this process to manufacture large-sized crystals in a comparatively shorter amount of time. Secondly, many observations of inevitable solvent inclusions have been made and linked to insufficient temperature control. Particularly, the synthesis of some organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites that display inverse temperature solubilities cannot be considered using this approach. Generally, alternative more efficient and universal growth techniques have since undergone substantial research and are addressed further.


4.2.4 Hydrothermal method. 
The hydrothermal approach is a supplement to flux growth or seed assistance. Crystals can be grown in a hydrothermal autoclave in one of two ways, i.e., either spontaneous growth or by focused transport to a particular seed crystal. The most prevalent type, spontaneously nucleated crystals, are created by transfer to a much smaller nucleation site. The crystals have sufficiently good quality, which may be suitable for further morphological and optical characteristics even though they are fully unregulated and rarely larger than a few millimeters. However, investigating this method of controlled growth to produce larger-sized single crystals is intriguing. The criteria include adequate seed crystals, properly sized feedstock, and strictly controlled transit circumstances. A process that occurs at equilibrium is the transit of feed material to the surrogate seeds, which is typically the same material as the target compound. A concentration gradient caused by a temperature difference induces a starting substance that is just marginally soluble to move comparatively slowly to a seed. The experimental expediency is unmatched given that the entire process is self-driven, even if it takes several weeks. Fluid confinement, pressure control, and solution reactivity are essential parameters that must be defined and may be achieved by meticulous autoclave engineering.
Tellurium-based double perovskite-type MA2TeI6 single crystals with variable band gaps and extended carrier diffusion lengths were grown hydrothermally by Ju et al.156 through the reaction of tellurium oxide (TeO2) and methylamine hydrochloride in hydroiodic acid (HI) at 220 °C for 24 h (Fig. 28i and j).95 Another study employed the hydrothermal process for the preparation of lead-free perovskite derivative Cs2SnCl6−xBrx single crystals for narrowband photodetectors.160 It should be noted that Cs2SnCl6−xBrx as a molecular salt contains highly stable and few hazardous Sn4+. Cs2SnCl6−xBrx single crystals were produced hydrothermally in a stainless steel Parr autoclave using CsCl and SnCl2 in a haloid acid solution at varying HCl/HBr ratios. Photographs of the as-grown single crystals of single and mixed halide compositions are shown in Fig. 28a–c, and the body colors may be gradually adjusted from clear to yellow, and eventually to dark red with an increase in the Br content in Cs2SnCl6−xBrx. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained to assess the crystal quality of the selected samples of Cs2SnCl6, Cs2SnBr6, and Cs2SnCl3Br3, as shown in Fig. 28d–f, respectively. The intentionally broken fracture surface had no porosity or other flaw, indicating that the crystals were of very high crystalline quality, as evidenced by their smooth and compact surfaces.

For the growth of Cs2AgInCl6 crystals, the precursor solution concentrations were adjusted to provide the required crystal quality and total transparency (owing to the ultralow solubility of the precursor material in concentrated HCl). The as-prepared single crystals had lustrous surfaces and were truncated octahedral in form with the measured size of 2.88 mm × 2.81 mm on average (Fig. 28g and h). The in nucleation solution rather than at the beaker walls could reduce the number of unneeded nucleation sites due to the hydrophobic properties of the autoclave, and consequently a large size was obtained. The same type of materials was used to create colorless Rb7Bi3Cl16 single crystals by dissolving rubidium chloride (RbCl) and bismuth chloride (BiCl3) at 160 °C for 24 h,162 which showed a size of up to 18.4 mm × 7.2 mm × 6.0 mm.


4.2.5 Bridgman method. 
The Bridgman method is performed in sealed ampules, and frequently used to generate large-sized single crystals with a known melting point. A quartz ampule can be moved inside of a furnace with a noticeable temperature difference. Powdered materials and seeds are placed in the quartz crucible, which is subsequently vacuum-sealed or filled with inert gas. It is transferred to the high-temperature area of the furnace and kept there until the powder precursors melt, which is then agitated at a certain speed in the direction of the cold area of the furnace. At a specific temperature, the crystal nucleation is triggered at the crucible tip, where the crystallization front begins to spread through the molten powder.
Two lead-free Sb(III)- and Bi(III)-based halide perovskites demonstrated significantly decreased toxicity. The Sb-based perovskites, in particular, showed a high absorption coefficient (>105 cm−1), modest effective masses (me: 0.34, mh: 0.42), and straight band gap (2.4 eV).163 The Bridgman method was successfully used to cultivate Cs3Sb2I9 single crystals, which have the same crystal structure as Rb3Bi2I9.163Fig. 29a and b show both the Cs3Bi2I9 and Ru3Bi2I9 single crystals produced using the Bridgman method, respectively.163

The Bridgman approach can be easily tested experimentally, and the interface curvature may be manipulated by varying the top- and bottom-crucible temperatures. The constraint for the crystal size is the volume of the ampule utilized for crystallization. However, the crystal-ampule interface has the potential to cause mechanical stress, fissures, or undesirable grain boundaries on the crystals given that the finished product will come into contact with the crucible wall. Moreover, this may unintentionally increase the impurity levels and defect density, severely restricting their practical applications.


4.2.6 Antisolvent vapor-assisted crystallization (AVC) method. 
The antisolvent vapor-assisted crystallization method is a highly effective technique for materials that are extremely soluble in certain solvents. By combining an antisolvent, the supersaturation state can be reached in this method. The mechanism depends on the solubility of the necessary product being drastically reduced, and then eventually its precipitation. The type of antisolvent, antisolvent diffusion duration, solvent, and antisolvent volume ratio, diffusion rate, and other factors all affect the effectiveness of this technique. Initially, the precursors are dissolved in a suitable solvent and the mixture is poured into a tiny vial that is housed inside a larger vial. The weak solvent is contained in the huge sealed vial. The weak solvent in the big vial slowly diffuses into the small vial containing the precursor solution over the course of a few hours. As the precursor material is insoluble in the inferior solvent, the ability to form crystals multiplies in the bottom of the inner vial, resulting in in the formation of SCs.
The antisolvent infiltration method was used to prepare high-quality CsCu2I3 single crystals (Fig. 29c).48 To create a saturated solution, cesium iodide and cuprous(I) iodide were mixed in a specific ratio of dimethyl formamide (DMF)-dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Then, the saturated solution was progressively lowered with methanol (antisolvent) to generate a white precipitate (the white precipitate immediately dissolved again) until it was no longer dissolved. The solution was filtered, and then placed in a beaker with a methanol atmosphere to grow crystals. Several days later, centimeter-scale high-quality CsCu2I3 single crystals were obtained. A photosensor based on perovskite-like methylammonium bismuth iodide (MA3Bi2I9) (Fig. 29d) was a strategic framework extended to device applications.164 Dichloromethane was used as the antisolvent in the AVC procedure to prepare the MA3Bi2I9 single crystals. The crystal size was adjusted by regulating the MA3Bi2I9 solution concentration and the growth time. Surprisingly, observable crystal formation began in just 2 h response time and finished in 24 h with a final size of up to a few millimeters. The form and size of the single crystals could be customized by adjusting variables such as the length of development and the timing of diffusion. For instance, the same team saw smaller and more regular crystal formation when the crystals were allowed to grow for 12 h in the precursor solution and another 12 h for DCM to diffuse into DMF. As shown in Fig. 29e,165 other Pb-free perovskite (NH4)3Sb2I9 single crystals prepared by using the AVC approach have also been reported. Noticeably, it was demonstrated that the precursor solution concentration, volume, and growth period all affected the dimensions of the crystals. The crystal size was measured to be around 5.7 mm × 2.1 mm, as seen in Fig. 29f.
Hence, the preparation of metal halide perovskite single crystals using the antisolvent vapor-assisted crystallization approach is quite effective. Due to the considerable decrease in synthesis time and complexity, it also permits scaling up and global application. However, the inability to obtain large-sized single crystals continues to be a problem, which also partially restricts their optoelectronic applications. Thus, it is important to investigate more effective and tightly controlled single crystal synthesis techniques.

4.3 Perovskite large-size single crystal growth techniques: differences and similarities
The various growth strategies can be compared to quantify their benefits and drawbacks in terms of a few key instrumental characteristics. Initially, it is crucial to determine if the solubility of the precursors depends positively or negatively on temperature, pressure, concentration, and other external influencing factors. Subsequently, a suitable growth method can be selected. A case-by-case analysis should be done to evaluate the solubility profiles that are complicated. The concentration of the precursor can influence the crystal growth rate, which is of utmost importance. Almost all single crystal growths have been shown to respond well to a precursor concentration of 1 to 5 wt% in solution. Nevertheless, for some materials, the above-mentioned conditions may result in extremely low growth rates or sudden bursts of spontaneous nucleation, both of which are undesirable extreme situations that may degrade the quality of the crystal or cause the seeds to be dissolved in the case of growth from the melt. Also, the judgment must be used to determine if, in some circumstances, the growth by straightforward dissolving and recrystallization is preferable to needlessly require complicated procedures utilizing uncontrolled seeds and autoclave effects. Finally, to select the best growth method, research should be done to determine the precise impact of temperature and strain on the final crystals. This order is relevant for materials that may be produced via many mechanisms, and we stress that the synthesis method used should typically be tailored to the intended application. Here, we present the advantages and disadvantages of the most popular strategies and give a quick overview of the intriguing new ones.
The slow cooling approach has a number of drawbacks despite being widely employed to date. Anisotropy, incongruency, variable crystallization temperatures, and strain-induced material instability are among the many drawbacks.166–169 In addition, the sluggish growth rate causes the solvent to accidentally enter the crystal. Inefficiently high volumes of the precursor solution are needed due to the broad range of varying temperatures, frequently making it impossible to achieve in the same heating setup. Furthermore, a significant amount of the solute is left in the solution after the process is finished. Lastly, it may be challenging to manage the appropriate rate of cooling given that the crystal characteristics are frequently temperature-dependent. Thus, slow cooling is not advisable as more accurate crystal formation processes are developed. For instance, it appears that the Bridgeman approach is the most straightforward and advantageous way for creating dimension-tolerant and big-volume, perovskite single crystals (PSCs) for use in photo-detection applications.170 These generally homogeneous crystals have enhanced electrical charge transport, and the desired stoichiometric composition may be reached without the use of dopants. Given that the raw materials are often of the highest purity, the best photodetectors with the highest electrical resistivity and charge carrier mobility (lifetime) values are produced. However, direct contact with the crucible has the potential to produce strain and impurities in the material, increasing the defect density over acceptable limits. This should be considered because the strain has been demonstrated to have an impact on the crystal shape and growth.
Saidaminov et al.71 and Tailor et al.171 both reported the growth of Cs3Bi2I9 crystals using the inverse temperature crystallization (ITC) method. Alternatively, the hydrothermal method makes it possible to access compounds that would otherwise be difficult to synthesize due to their high melting points, incongruent melting, thermal strain, etc. It is a somewhat experimental approach that allows for the testing of novel materials through the exploration of potential phases of space. The isothermal bath, low temperature, and sealed reaction procedure used here guarantee exceptionally high quality crystals with little thermal flaws or contaminants.
We are quite hopeful that antisolvent crystallization will become a viable new option for producing high-quality and size-controlled Pb-free PSCs. Although melt-based technologies enable researchers to create a variety of materials, they also have some limitations. Considering this, we think it will be worthwhile to investigate approaches based on floating zones for PSC growth applications. The procedure is quick, and the reaction takes place in isolation, ruling out quality loss caused by impurities. Moreover, there is no needless strain because the crystal does not come into contact with the reaction vessel. This means that perovskite materials may soon be examined thermodynamically and experimentally. Although there has been great success in reporting new Pb-free perovskite systems with various structural and electronic dimensionalities, it is vital to consider that many of these synthesized materials are not the best choice for photodetection applications. It is not feasible to experimentally synthesize any of these combinations for the purpose of examining their pertinent optoelectronic characteristics due to the vastness of the material space for screening acceptable Pb-free perovskites.
Theoretical computations, especially utilizing density functional theory (DFT), can help materials scientists in these circumstances.172–174 Nevertheless, the variation between the material qualities proposed theoretically and those observed empirically can be modulated by the approximations used in the computational process. For instance, it is well known that the electrical bandgaps of perovskites are underestimated using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the DFT approach.172,175–177 Alternatively, the hybrid Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) functional findings offer greater agreement with the experimental data, but they do not give a complete picture of the many-body effects. Nevertheless, utilizing Green's function with screened Coulomb interaction (GW) or Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) simulations have higher processing costs, which can be incorporated for better findings. It is crucial to include spin–orbit coupling (SOC) when calculating Pb-free perovskite systems with heavy B-site cations such as Bi or Sb given that these relativistic interactions can divide the conduction band minimum (CBM) and reduce the bandgap.178–181 The majority of the projections are produced at 0 K, and therefore they do not consider temperature-induced changes. Although entropic adjustments may be used to somewhat overcome this issue, their high computing costs prevent many academics from including them in their computations. The unit cell size and geometry determined during the computations are among other potential sources of discrepancy with experimental data that may potentially have an impact on the theoretical outcomes. In summary, theoretical simulations can only qualitatively filter a small number of material combinations, which may subsequently be synthesized to determine their quantitative optoelectronic capabilities. Pleasingly, these computations can effectively narrow a large number of potentially viable Pb-free perovskite systems to only a select handful. However, before drawing too many conclusions from these theoretical calculations, experimentalists should take a closer look at the methods used considering the major shortcomings of DFT calculations outlined above. For these understudied systems, we think that a good balance between modeling and experimental synthesis is the way to go.
5. Photodetection devices
In this section, we summarize and discuss the photodetection performance of widely investigated perovskite-based photodetectors. Generally, photodetectors are divided into broadband photodetectors (BPs) and narrowband photodetectors (NPs). A broad spectrum is induced by broadband photodetectors, such as visible light and ultraviolet light. Narrow spectra are usually induced by narrowband photodetectors, such as red, green, and blue. Due to their strong selectivity, narrowband photodetectors provide innovative and subversive applications in high-speed optical communication and high-resolution imaging in scientific research and industrial fields. Perovskite-based photodetectors are widely used in photodiodes, photoconductors, and phototransistors. The structure of the photodetector can be divided into lateral and vertical ones according to the geometric configuration of the device. The lateral structure includes s photoconductor and phototransistor, while the vertical structure includes s photoconductor and photodiode. Fig. 30 shows the two-terminal device of photodiode and photoconductor and three-terminal device of phototransistor with source, drain, and gate electrodes. Based on the photovoltaic effect, the photodiodes have a very similar setup to a solar cell, which are designed to work with a reverse applied electric field and have a low dark current and quick charge collecting. When the device is exposed to light, high-energy photons can be converted to photogenerated carriers.182 Subsequently, the photocurrent is produced by these photogenerated carriers at the bias voltage or built-in potential. Most photodiodes are adopted by vertical structures, where electrons and holes are extracted through the electron transport layer (ETL) and hole transport layer (HTL), respectively. The active layer film thickness, usually up to tens of nanometers, affects the carrier transit distance. Common topologies for perovskite photodiodes include conventional and reverse categories, where the inclusion of a barrier layer or ETL/HTL is thought to boost the performance. Consequently, the device response time is substantially expedited and the carrier transiting time is extremely short. The response speed is regarded to be faster than that of lateral devices because of the thin active layer. Nevertheless, the quantum efficiency is less than 100%.183 The device performance may also be hampered by the necessity for electrode materials with excellent light transmission.

The most basic type of electronic device is a photoconductor, which is sandwiched by a photosensitive substance between two metal electrodes to create a “metal–semiconductor–metal” (MSM) heterojunction through an ohmic contact to produce free charge carriers upon exposure to light. The procedure involves applying an electric field directly to the active substance, which causes charge carriers to migrate. The optically excited electrons and holes flow in opposite directions, but because electrons move more quickly than holes, the holes are not there when the electrons arrive at the electrodes. Electrons will enter the semiconductor from the negative pole of the electrode, migrate to the positive pole of the electrode, and then exit to preserve the electrical neutrality of the semiconductor. An incoming photon can excite several electrons to produce a current by repeating this process until the holes reach the opposite pole,184 and then amplify the intrinsic photocurrent (photoconductivity gain). High gain can increase the sensitivity of photodetectors, opening up a wide range of application possibilities in high-speed optical communication and high-resolution imaging. High responsiveness is demonstrated by perovskite-type photoconductors with either vertical or lateral device topologies. The small electrode spacing in vertical photoconductors allows for excellent gain at low operating voltage. However, to achieve high gain, lateral devices with large electrode spacing require a higher working voltage. However, the high gain comes at the sacrifice of response time.183 The response time of a photoconductor is usually very sluggish, which leads to a poor specific detection rate. Consequently, there must be a trade-off between the gain and response time to attain an excellent device performance.
Typically, phototransistors have a three-terminal device structure, similar to that of field-effect transistors (FETs). In addition to the source and drain, phototransistors also have a gate and a dielectric layer between the semiconductor channel and gate. By adjusting the gate voltage, the gate further controls the conductance of the semiconductor channel in the light or dark, allowing the photocurrent to be amplified or the dark current to be decreased. An electron-conducting channel is induced between the source and drain when the gate is forward biased. In the conductive channel, when light strikes the semiconductor area the electrons produced will build up. Moreover, the dark current can be less than that in a photoconductor given that the holes are confined in the semiconductor area.185 Because of the significantly increased carrier lifetime and decreased recombination of electron–hole pairs, the device is more responsive than a photoconductor one.186 By varying the gate bias voltage, the gain of the phototransistor is higher than that of the photoconductor, further enhancing the R and EQE. Alternatively, these phototransistors demand very high material quality, with very expensive manufacturing costs especially for large-area devices. The photodetection performance of perovskite large-size single-crystal photoconductors will be the main topic of this section. The performance of perovskite large-size single crystal photodetectors is summarized in Table 2.

5.1 Photoconductor-type photodetectors
The intrinsic photocurrent amplification phenomenon is demonstrated in a photoconductor-type photodetector, where photo-generated carriers transit between two electrodes before recombination.53 The photocurrent gain is related to the carrier lifespan and carrier mobility, but is inversely proportional to channel width. Consequently, photoconductors can have high photocurrent gain, and therefore high responsivity and detectivity, due to the high carrier mobility and extended carrier lifetime. Also, reducing the channel width is a practical technique to increase the performance metrics.

5.1.1 Photoconductors based on bulk single crystals. 
The first photoconductor based on the (100) facet of an MAPbI3 bulk single crystal was reported by Lian et al., which showed a superior performance to that based on a polycrystalline thin film (Fig. 31).7 A high response of 953 A W−1 and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 2.22% × 105% at 1 V bias using a straightforward Au/MAPbI3/Au planar device could be achieved under irradiation with 532 nm light of 2.12 nW cm−2 (Fig. 31c and d). Moreover, it was discovered that the single crystal photodetectors had high stability and a relatively quick response time of 58 μs (Fig. 31e and f).

Optimizing the crystal growth is crucial to enhancing the detector performance given that the crystal quality is directly correlated with the carrier lifetime and mobility. To prepare MAPbBr3 single crystals, Liu et al. used a low-temperature-gradient crystallization technique (Fig. 32a and b).188 The carrier mobility, lifespan, and crystal homogeneity all clearly improved using this technique. Based on the Au/MAPbBr3/Au device configuration, the as-fabricated photodetector exhibited an extremely high responsivity, EQE, and specific detectivity of 6 × 1013 Jones (Fig. 32c and d). Importantly, after 35 days of storage, the photodetector exhibited outstanding stability with 90% current density (Fig. 32e). A large-area (≈1300 mm2) imaging assembly with a 729-pixel sensor array was built because the photodetector exhibited an extremely uniform photocurrent and dark current. This assembly has exceptional imaging performance. Considering the extremely straightforward metal/perovskite/metal configuration, the device manufacturing method is another potential factor that may affect the detector performance in addition to crystal quality. Due to the fragility of perovskite materials, vacuum-high-energy deposition atom bombardment and severe local heating can easily cause crystal surface damage. For basic research on facet-dependent optoelectronic characteristics, perovskite single-crystal photodetectors are also helpful.189 Ding et al. created photodetectors on the (220) and (100) facets of MAPbI3 single crystals.189 The experimental results showed the significant anisotropy of optoelectronic characteristics, which was explained in terms of surface structures and ion migration.

5.1.2 Photoconductors based on single-crystal thin films. 
According to the theory behind photoconductor-type photodetectors, narrow channels can result in greater responsiveness and photocurrent gain. However, it is difficult to build sub-micrometer channels using the relatively inexpensive vacuum deposition method for both bulk and micro single crystals. In this instance, single-crystal thin films offer a way to regulate the channel width by controlling the film thickness down to sub-micrometer levels. The space-confined approach, in which the vertical crystal growth is constrained by the substrates, is the most widely used technique for producing single-crystal thin films.65 The single-crystal thin films are produced because the crystals can only grow in the lateral direction. Yang et al. used the space-confined technique in conjunction with external pressure to grow a MAPbBr3 single-crystal thin film with a thickness of hundreds of nanometers.190 Then, to fabricate a vertical-structure photodetector, two electrodes were deposited on the opposite sides of the single-crystal thin film that had just been formed. In this instance, the channel width was determined by the thickness of the crystal. A record photocurrent gain of 50 million and gain band-width product of 70 GHz by employing the sub-micrometer channel were achieved (Fig. 33a–e). The space-confined approach often produces crystals that are several millimeters or hundreds of micrometers in size.65 Liu et al. created the top-down technique, in which bulk single-crystals were first grown, and then sliced into thin wafers, to produce large-area single crystal thin films.144 However, using the top-down approach, the thickness could scarcely be reduced below 100 μm. It is particularly noteworthy that massive photodetector arrays on perovskite large-area single-crystal wafers have interesting prospective uses as image sensors, as shown by Gu et al. (Fig. 33f–i).133

Ion migration brought on by an electrical field is a problem for photoconductors made of perovskite single crystals because it produces a large dark current, which increases the noise and reduces the detectability. Ion migration can occur in single crystals of the extensively studied three-dimensional perovskites. Recently, Huang et al. reported that the activation energy of ion migration increased significantly in two-dimensional perovskites because of the lower ion vacancy compared to three-dimensional perovskites.191 In two-dimensional perovskite single crystals, the ion migration can be effectively inhibited, which results in low dark current and good detectivity. Based on a superior and bendable two-dimensional single crystal of (C6H5CH2CH2NH3)2PbI4, Liu et al. fabricated a lateral photoconductor (Fig. 34a–c).126 The photoconductor had a modest responsivity of 98.17 A W−1, but because of its extremely low dark current, an extremely low noise of 9.18 × 1016 A Hz−1, and consequently high detectivity of 1.62 × 1015 cm Hz1/2 W−1 could be achieved (Fig. 34d and f). Comparing this detectivity to that based on three-dimensional perovskite single crystals, it has one to two orders of magnitude improvement.

5.2 Photodiode-type photodetectors
A sandwiched configuration with two asymmetrical electrodes is utilized in photodiode-type photodetectors based on perovskite single crystals.53 The primary benefit of photodiode-type photodetectors is their quick response time, which has the potential for fast detection and light communication. Moreover, the presence of an ETL and HTL causes electrons and holes to be preferentially collected, resulting in little to no photocurrent gain and low dark current, respectively. Thus, photodiode-type photodetectors often exhibit poorer responsiveness compared to photoconductor-type ones.

5.2.1 Photodiodes based on bulk single crystals. 
A visible-blind UV photodetector based on an MAPbCl3 bulk single crystal with a vertical structure was initially described by Maculan et al. (Fig. 35a and b).97 The MAPbCl3 single crystal was produced from a DMF-DMSO mixed solution using the inverse temperature crystallization (ITC) technique. The as-grown single crystal had exceptional qualities, including a low trap density of 3.1 × 1010 cm3 and strong carrier mobility of 42 cm2 V−1 S−1, which also presented a long carrier lifetime of 662 ns. The single crystal was an excellent choice for use in visible-blind UV photodetectors due to its constrained absorption range. The as-fabricated UV photodetectors showed a response speed of 24 ms, specific detectivity of 1.2 × 1010 Jones, on/off current of 1100, responsivity of 46.9 mA W−1, and decay speed of 62 ms (Fig. 35c–e). As shown in Fig. 35f, it was found that the MAPbCl3 single crystals presented high photostability over 12 h. The all-inorganic perovskite exhibited superior stability than the organic–inorganic hybrid ones as well as retaining their optoelectronic capabilities. To prepare millimeter-sized cesium lead bromide bulk single crystals with various compositions, such as CsPbBr3, Cs4PbBr6, and CsPb2Br5, Saidaminov et al. devised a quick, low-temperature, solution-based phase-selective synthesis.192 The self-powered visible-light detectors based on millimeter-sized CsPbBr3 single crystals could achieve a higher ON/OFF ratio of 105 and response time of 60 ms. Narrowband photodetectors can be built using the vast thickness of the bulk single crystal and the presence of surface charge traps. A series of bulk perovskite single crystals with an absorption edge continually adjusted from blue to red was prepared by Fang et al.37 After being excited by short-wavelength light, the photogenerated carriers were mostly found on the surface of the single crystal, but could not be collected because of the high recombination aided by the surface charge traps. Alternatively, the carriers generated by sub-bandgap stimulation were spread throughout the single crystal and could be partially transported and collected by the electrode, producing a photo-response at the band edge location.

5.2.2 Photodiodes based on single-crystal thin films. 
Bulk single crystals are exceedingly thick, which results in a very long carrier transit time and poor response speed. Accordingly, by creating a hydrophobic interface-constrained lateral crystal growth technique, Bao et al. prepared millimeter-sized MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 single-crystal thin films with a thickness of around 10 μm.201 Then, a photodetector was constructed with the architecture of ITO/PTAA/single-crystal thin film/C60/BCP/Cu (Fig. 36a). Given that there were no grain boundaries or pinholes, the dark current was successfully suppressed, resulting in a very low noise current of 1.4 fA Hz−1/2 (Fig. 36b), low detection limit of 0.35 pW cm−2 (Fig. 36f), and high specific detectivity of 1.5 × 1013 Jones (Fig. 36e). Later, Xiao et al. found that the sluggish trapping/detrapping processes brought on by the surface charge traps were the key factor limiting the response speed of the photodetectors.193 The response speed of the photodetectors based on MAPbI3 single-crystal thin films with a thickness of 15 μm increased 100-fold as a consequence of the efficient passivation of the surface charge traps by argon plasma treatment from 1.5 μs to 15 ns. The carrier transit time in this device was estimated to be around 15 ns based on the carrier mobility of 150 cm2 V−1 s−1 and built-in potential of 1 V. This estimate is comparable with the measured response time, indicating that the response time was solely constrained by the transit time. Hence, to further accelerate the response speed in the future, it will be necessary to reduce the thickness down to below 10 μm, which is still a significant challenge for lead-iodide perovskite single crystals.

By altering the halide ions, the light response range of perovskite materials can be adjusted. Based on MAPbCl3 single-crystal thin films, Chen et al. developed visible-blind UV photodetectors with a fast response speed and good specific detectivity.5,194 The response time of 15 ns was achieved by controlling the crystal thickness at 1 μm, which was several orders of magnitude faster than the previously reported solution-processed polycrystalline film UV photodetectors. The excellent performance is comparable to reported UV photodetectors based on conventional inorganic semiconductors.

5.3 Photodetectors on lead-free perovskite single crystals
The first lead-free perovskite single crystal photodetector with a structure of Au/Cs2AgInCl6/Au was created by Tang and colleagues.161 As seen in Fig. 37a, the photodetector exhibited a clear photocurrent and dark current with a bias of 5 V under 365 nm light. It was found that the photocurrent increased from 5 nA to 8 nA when the photodetector was exposed in the air from vacuum condition. The increased surface conductance brought on by oxygen in the air is considered the major cause of the current increase. The performance of the devices may be harmed by the surface flaws, which can decrease the resistance and increase dark current. A significant factor in photodetectors is their response time measured using a −3 dB cutoff frequency, which was discovered to be impacted by surface flaws because the response time of the device under vacuum was shorter than that in air (Fig. 37b).

A long carrier diffusion length of 3.0 mm in low-trap state density MA3Sb2I9 single crystals was observed.195 The photodetector was constructed with a single crystal sandwiched between two Au metal electrodes, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 37c. With a monochromatic light source of 460 nm, the device presented an improved responsivity of 40 A W−1, detectivity of around 1012 Jones, and quick response time of ≪1 ms (Fig. 37d).
A photodetector composed of a Cs2SnCl6−xBrx single crystal was successfully fabricated by Zhou et al.,160 which produced a narrowband photodetection characterization with a high detectivity of 2.71 × 1010 Jones and FWHM of ∼45 nm. Moreover, by altering the bandgap of the Cs2SnCl6−xBrxBrx single crystals and switching the halide compositions, the photo-response spectrum was modified from near violet to orange. The photodetector based on Cs2AgBiBr6 single crystal displayed specific detectivity in the range of 1.38–2.66 × 109 Jones under 400 nm laser irradiation.196 Ji et al. reported the fabrication of a (TMHD)BiBr5 single crystal photodetector with a high Ion/off ratio (≈103) and quick response time of 8.9–10.2 ms.155
6. Summary and outlook
In this review, we comprehensively described the most recent advances in both LHP and LFHP large-size single crystal growth towards photodetection research. Several conventional and effective synthesis approaches and preparation processes were emphatically introduced, which can be appropriately employed depending on the benefits and drawbacks of particular perovskite materials. Also, the construction and performance assessment metrics of large-size single crystal photodetectors were presented. Hybrid halide perovskites are intriguing possibilities for the creation of novel and game-changing applications in the field of light detection due to their benefits of simple processing, variable bandgaps, substantial absorption coefficient, ambipolar charge transport, and long diffusion length. Perovskite photodetectors with high performance have been demonstrated for both narrowband and broadband applications. Materials scientists have concentrated on controlling single crystal growth as well as composition tweaking. Particularly, compared to polycrystalline thin films, perovskite single-crystals have promising opportunities for manufacturing superior-quality narrowband photodetectors. With fewer internal grain boundaries and defect-induced trap states, perovskite single crystals display increased charge transport and longer charge carrier lifetime, resulting in a higher energy conversion efficiency. The long-term performance of a device depends on the capacity of its materials to maintain exceptional chemical stability, which intrinsically belong to the single crystal. However, it is worth noting that less in situ growth of perovskite single crystals occurs on the typically used transport layer or the bottom substrate. Hence, to make single crystals compatible with subsequent device fabrication stages for further optoelectronic applications, researchers should prevent perovskite single crystals from being damaged because it can degrade the device performance. Accordingly, in situ growth techniques of single crystals directly on the transport layer or the electrode are regarded as a potential remedy for this problem.197 The process of in situ growth of perovskite single crystals can greatly minimize device contaminants and boost the stability. In comparison to LHPs, the investment in LFHPs is unquestionably insufficient, and their photodetection applications have not been thoroughly investigated. To fully realize the promise of LFHPs, greater knowledge of their underlying processes, crystal structures, and photoelectric characteristics is required. More effective synthetic procedures for high-quality LFHPs with various morphologies and nanostructures should be developed. Furthermore, the stability of certain perovskites with outstanding photoelectric capabilities has not witnessed breakthrough development, which is far from the requirement in practical application. Some other effective strategies should be explored to prepare stable LFHPs. Although the performance of LFHP-based photodetectors is still be inferior to that of LHP-based devices, huge efforts need to be devoted to improve the crystal stability and retain its superior photophysical properties. It is expected that many of these current challenges in LFHPs can be overcome rapidly, enabling environment-friendly, cheap, and stable photodetection applications.
Long-term stability is a key issue for the actual deployment of perovskite photodetectors. Due to their weak ionic bonds, perovskites exposed to light radiation for extended periods are susceptible to phase separation or ion migration. Although the perovskite device stability can be improved by an encapsulation post-processing method, it will be essential to produce chemically stable perovskites employing the intrinsic stability of materials themselves to substantially address the current difficulties in perovskite photodetectors. Also, we noted that some recent research focused on using interface engineering with buffer layers, controlling perovskite crystallization morphologies, passivating perovskite surface defects, and adopting sandwiched device architectures198 to improve the operating stability in photodetectors. However, chemically stable perovskite large-size single crystals may be the most suitable candidates and will essentially solve the stability problems of perovskite-based photodetectors in practical applications.
Wearable technologies, biological sensors, and folding displays are some of the next-generation applications for flexible perovskite photodetectors. However, perovskite single crystals with hard and brittle characteristics are challenging to deal with the combination on flexible substrates. Recently, Xu et al. proposed a method for preparing perovskite single crystals on flexible substrates by employing lithography-assisted epitaxial growth and transfer in solution.199 By creating a micro-nano structure, the concentrated stress on the active layer is reduced to a neutral mechanical plane, preventing fractures from developing and expanding. Accordingly, the mechanical flexibility of the material is greatly boosted when perovskite crystals are reduced to the nanoscale. Perovskite photodetectors with chip-scale miniaturized multispectral detection are still difficult to implement in optical communication, imaging, and identification systems, particularly in the field of integrated optoelectronics. A tiny multispectral detector without optical components was demonstrated by Xu et al.,200 which was mounted on a composition gradient perovskite microwire with a diameter of 30 μm and length of 4 mm. A perfect, high-quality MAPbX3 microwire was prepared by using the space-limit solution method, which was then controlled to the halide exchange for the adjustment of light bandgaps by using the dipping pull method. The tiny detector was capable of multispectral sensing and discriminating from 450 nm to 790 nm and had a spectral resolution of roughly 25 nm with a 10 nm mismatch. With the development and improvement of perovskite crystal growth technologies in the future, it is believed that both LHP- and LFHP-based single crystals with excellent optoelectronic properties will be prepared and bring bright prospects for high-performance photodetectors.
