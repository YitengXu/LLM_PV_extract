    , Accepted 5th March 2014First published on 5th March 2014AbstractRE3+ (Er3+/Tm3+/Yb3+) ions tri-doped SrY2O4 nanocrystalline phosphors were synthesized by a citrate sol–gel method. After annealing at 1300 °C, the structure was identified to be pure orthorhombic and the particles were found to be nearly spherical in shape. The up-conversion emission spectra of the SrY2O4:1Er3+ phosphor revealed a bright green emission (4S3/2 → 4I15/2) around 551 nm. To enhance the red emission of the Er3+ ions, Yb3+ ions were co-doped with Er3+ ions, leading to a greenish yellow emission under 980 nm excitation. In the case of the 1Er3+/1Tm3+/3Yb3+ ions tri-doped phosphor, white-light emission was observed corresponding to the 1G4 → 3H6 (Tm3+), 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (Er3+) and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 (Er3+) transitions at 487, 551 and 664 nm, respectively. It was interestingly noticed that, when the exciting pump power was changed from 100 to 900 mW, the blue emission band of the Tm3+ ions was enhanced by the suppression of the red and green emission bands of the Er3+ ions so that the chromaticity coordinates were also moved to the cyan emission region. This feature suggests that the Er3+ ion may also act as a sensitizer for the Tm3+ and Yb3+ ions and a possible energy transfer mechanism was also discussed.
1. Introduction
Up-conversion (UC) luminescence is a unique process which is based on the ability of converting lower energy (longer wavelength) near-infrared (NIR) radiations to higher energy (shorter wavelength) visible or ultraviolet (UV) radiations and it usually does not occur in nature.1,2 Essentially, the trivalent rare-earth (RE) ions activated UC nanocrystalline materials have many fascinating applications in different fields such as lasers, sensors, solar cells, three-dimensional (3D) high-resolution displays, infrared quantum counters, bio labels, etc. and principally in the fields of life sciences because the longer wavelength allows for a deeper penetration of exciting light into biological tissues without causing any damage.3–7 The UC emission efficiency is strongly affected by the properties of the host lattice and the interaction between the host lattice and the dopant ions. Classically, the RE ions provide an intense narrow band emission through UC when pumped with NIR radiation. However, among the RE ions, the Y3+, Sc3+, La3+, and Lu3+ ions are often preferred as host materials because of the absence of unpaired 4f electrons.8
Thulium (Tm3+) was the first and foremost ion to demonstrate the UC mechanism and it emits a blue color from its 3P0, 1D2 and 1G4 levels which are used in electroluminescent devices.9 Likewise, erbium (Er3+) is a wonderful green color emitting activator ion for UC since it provides intermediate levels such as 4I11/2 and 4I13/2 with long lifetimes, which are easily accessible with NIR radiation.10,11 Whereas, the red emission band of the Er3+ ions increases its intensity by the addition of Yb3+ ions because the ytterbium (Yb3+) has only two energy levels and the energy gap between the ground state (2F7/2) and excited state (2F5/2) is well coordinated with the transition of an activator dopant ion.1,12 Thus, the Yb3+ ions act as an efficient sensitizer for the Er3+ and Tm3+ ions.
Classically, phosphors have been prepared by a traditional solid-state reaction method, but this procedure causes several impurity phases in the resultant product and also the particles are usually in the micrometer range due to insufficient mixing and the low reactivity of the raw materials. At present, however, there are many wet-chemical techniques such as combustion, co-precipitation, spray-pyrolysis, sol–gel, hydrothermal, and solvothermal methods.13,14 Among them, the sol–gel process has many significant advantages such as the association of the solid colloidal state with a liquid medium to avoid the eventual dispersion of dust, novel chemical compositions and ultra-fine uniform ceramic powders with an excellent purity at relatively low reaction temperature.15
It is well known that the host lattice with a low-phonon energy would decrease the multiphonon relaxations and increase the UC emission efficiency. The SrY2O4 host lattice which belongs to the well-ordered CaFe2O4 structure has a relatively low phonon energy with high-chemical durability, thermal stability and environmentally-friendly characteristics.16 Up to now, no reports have been found on the UC emission properties of the Er3+/Tm3+/Yb3+ ions tri-doped SrY2O4 phosphors. In this work, we reported the UC emission properties of the Er3+ ions single-doped, Er3+/Yb3+ ions co-doped and Er3+/Tm3+/Yb3+ ion tri-doped SrY2O4 nanocrystalline phosphors under 980 nm excitation. Hence, bright green, classic yellow, pleasant white and cyan emissions were achieved by optimizing the dopant concentrations. The structural and morphological properties were examined by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and scanning electron microscope (SEM) measurements after annealing at 1300 °C.
2. Experimental details
For the synthesis of the SrY2O4:Er3+/Tm3+/Yb3+ nanocrystalline phosphors, a citrate sol–gel method was employed. Stoichiometric amounts of high-purity grade strontium nitrate [Sr(NO3)2], yttrium nitrate hexahydrate [Y(NO3)3·6H2O], erbium nitrate pentahydrate [Er(NO3)3·5H2O], thulium nitrate pentahydrate [Tm(NO3)3·5H2O], ytterbium nitrate pentahydrate [Yb(NO3)3·5H2O] and citric acid [HOC(COOH)(CH2COOH)2] were used. Two individual solutions were prepared using Pyrex (borosilicate glass) beakers: Solution I by dissolving 1 mM of strontium nitrate and 2 mM of citric acid in de-ionized (DI) water, and Solution II by dissolving 2(1 − x) mM of yttrium nitrate, 2x mM of RE (Er3+/Tm3+/Yb3+) nitrate, and 4 mM of citric acid in DI water. First, these two solutions were stirred individually using a magnetic stirrer for 30 min and then they were mixed and stirred until the formation of a homogeneous solution occurred. After that, the mixture was heated on a hot plate while maintaining the solution temperature at 80 °C under continuous magnetic stirring. After the cap of the beaker was covered for 12 h to prevent the evaporated solution from leaving, it was removed. The solution was evaporated within 1 h after opening the cap, which forms a yellowish wet gel. When the gel was dried at 120 °C, porous solid matrices, called xerogels, were obtained. With further heating at 500 °C for 5 h, the gel decomposed into black-colored flakes with an extremely fine particle size. For characterization, further annealing was performed on the samples.
The XRD patterns of the phosphor samples were measured on a Mac Science (M18XHF-SRA) X-ray powder diffractometer with CuKα = 1.5406 Å. The morphologies of the samples were observed by using a field-emission SEM (FE-SEM, JEOL JSM-6700). A 980 nm continuous wave laser diode was employed as the pumping source to obtain the luminescence spectra. The emitted light was focused into a 75 cm monochromator and detected by a thermoelectrically cooled photomultiplier tube and the signal was fed to a digital oscilloscope.
3. Results and discussion
The nanocrystalline SrY(2−x−y−z)O4 (x = 0.01, y = 0.01, and z = 0.03) phosphors were prepared by a facile synthesis route, the so-called citrate sol–gel method, where citric acid is employed as a chelating agent. According to our earlier report,17 the optimal annealing temperature was found to be 1300 °C, and all the characterizations were performed after the samples had been annealed at this temperature. The XRD patterns of the RE (Er3+/Tm3+/Yb3+) ions tri-doped SrY2O4 nanocrystalline phosphors annealed at 1300 °C are shown in Fig. 1(a) and at this temperature a well-crystallized pure orthorhombic phase was identified without any impurity phase. All the diffraction peaks agreed well with the standard JCPDS card No. 32-1272 with the space group pnam(62). Furthermore, the co-doped (Er3+, Tm3+, and Yb3+) ions have no impurity peaks detected as compared to the pure SrY2O4 host lattice. From the well-known Scherrer equation, Dhkl = kλ/βcosθ, where D is the average crystallite size, λ is the X-ray wavelength (1.5406 Å), β is the full width at half maximum and θ is the diffraction angle of an observed peak, the crystallite size can be estimated. The average crystallite size of ∼75 nm was obtained. The inset of Fig. 1(a) shows the SEM image of the SrY2O4 nanocrystalline phosphors annealed at 1300 °C. The particles had a nearly spherical shape and were closely packed. It is noted that the closely packed particles prevent the scattering of light and thus a more efficient output light which is required for flat-panel displays18 can be caught. The electronic structure of the SrY2O4 host lattice, which belongs to the family of the CaFe2O4 structure and is crystallized into an orthorhombic phase, is shown in Fig. 1(b). The SrY2O4 structure is constructed by an Y2O42− framework of double octahedra, where one is an almost undistorted octahedral site and the other is a substantially distorted site, and Sr ions which reside within the framework with the bicapped trigonal prismatic site. The Sr and Y atoms are coordinated by eight and six oxygen atoms, respectively.19

Fig. 2 shows the UC emission spectra of the Er3+ ions (1 mol%) single-doped SrY2O4 phosphors at different pumping powers from 100 to 900 mW under 980 nm excitation. The UC spectra display two distinct green emission bands and one red emission band at 526, 551 and 664 nm, respectively, corresponding to the 2H11/2, 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 transitions to the ground state, 4I15/2, of the Er3+ ions. Among these three emission bands, the green emission band that occurred at 551 nm is more prominent. The UC emission intensity increased without saturation by increasing the pump power from 100 to 900 mW. This phenomenon can be explained by the mechanism involving two photon absorption using an energy level diagram of the Er3+ ions as shown in Fig. 6.

Fig. 3 shows the UC emission spectra of the 1 mol% Er3+/3 mol% Yb3+ (i.e., 1Er3+/3Yb3+) ions co-doped SrY2O4 phosphors at pump powers ranging from 100 to 900 mW under 980 nm excitation. Each spectrum displays a weak emission band in the green region around 526 nm due to the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 transition and two high intense emission bands in the green and red regions with peaks centered at 551 and 664 nm corresponding to the 4S3/2 → 4I15/2, and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of the Er3+ ions, respectively. It is worthwhile to mention that the intensity of the red emission band was slightly larger than that of the green emission band when the pump power of 100 mW was used. However, on increasing the pumping power from 100 to 900 mW, the green emission intensity became dominant as compared to the red emission intensity as clearly displayed in Fig. 3. This can be explained by the fact that the excited Yb3+ ions transfer their energy to the Er3+ ions in the ground state as well as in the excited state because the Yb3+ ions have a stronger ability than the Er3+ ions to absorb the pumping power.20 Initially, the 4I11/2 level of the Er3+ ions was populated by two possible ways: one is ground state absorption (4I15/2 → 4I11/2) of Er3+ ions and the other one is the energy transfer process from the excited Yb3+ ions in the 2F5/2 level to the Er3+ ions in the 4I11/2 state. Then, some of the Er3+ ions from the 4I11/2 state relaxed nonradiatively to the 4I13/2 state and the excited Er3+ ions in the 4I11/2 and 4I13/2 states absorbed the second photon along with an efficient energy transfer from the excited Yb3+ ions to populate the 4F7/2 and 4F9/2 levels, respectively. Then, the excited Er3+ ions in the 4F7/2 state relaxed nonradiatively to populate the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 states. Finally, the Er3+ ions in the 2H11/2, 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 states relaxed radiatively to the ground state, 4I15/2, by producing enhanced green and red emissions at 526, 551 and 664 nm, respectively.
 Fig. 3  The UC emission spectra of the SrY2O4:1Er3+/3Yb3+ nanocrystalline phosphors under 980 nm excitation with a series of pump powers from 100 to 900 mW. 
To get the white light, the Tm3+ ions were also doped together with the 1Er3+/3Yb3+ ions in the SrY2O4 host lattice. In this complex tri-doped system, all of the three fundamental color (red, green and blue) emissions were obtained simultaneously under 980 nm excitation. The variations of the UC emission intensities at different pump powers (from 100 to 900 mW) are shown in Fig. 4. In the emission spectra, the blue emission band at 487 nm (1G4 → 3H6) is due to the Tm3+ ions, the green emission bands at 526 nm (2H11/2 → 4I15/2) and 551 nm (4S3/2 → 4I15/2) are due to the Er3+ ions and the red emission band at 664 nm is due to the (4F9/2 → 4I15/2) and (1G4 → 3F4) transitions of the Er3+ and Tm3+ ions, respectively. When the pump power was changed from 100 to 300 mW, the red emission band at 664 nm was dominant in the spectra. With a further increase of the pump power from 300 to 900 mW, the blue emission intensity increased gradually. For a better understanding, a comparison of the UC emission spectra of the Er3+ ions single-doped, Er3+/Yb3+ ions co-doped, and Er3+/Tm3+/Yb3+ ions tri-doped SrY2O4 nanocrystalline phosphors under 980 nm excitation is shown in Fig. 5(a). All the spectra were measured using 900 mW pump power and the digital photograph of the white-light emission shown in the figure was taken at the time of UC measurement. Fig. 5(b) shows the UC emission spectra of the Er3+/Tm3+/Yb3+ ions tri-doped SrY2O4 nanocrystalline phosphors with different concentrations (3, 5 and 7 mol%) of Yb3+ ions when the pump power of 500 mW was employed under 980 nm excitation. From the spectra, it is notable that, at 3 mol% of Yb3+ ion concentration, the spectrum was obtained with nearly equal emission intensities for all the three (Er3+, Tm3+, and Yb3+) RE ions, which is necessary to acquire white-light emission. In addition, on increasing the Yb3+ ion concentration, the intensity of the blue emission dominated those of the remaining green and red emission bands due to the increased energy transfer from the Yb3+ and Er3+ ions to the Tm3+ ions. Thus, in order to get the white-light emission, we selected the Yb3+ ion concentration of 3 mol% and a possible energy transfer mechanism was discussed as follows.

 Fig. 6  The simplified energy level diagram with the proposed UC mechanisms of the Er3+, Tm3+ and Yb3+ ions tri-doped SrY2O4 nanocrystalline phosphors. 
A possible UC mechanism was discussed based on the quadratic dependence of the pump power and the simplified energy level diagram is illustrated in Fig. 6. The energy transfer mechanism between the Er3+ and Yb3+ ions is similar as discussed above. In the case of the Tm3+ and Yb3+ ions, the excited Yb3+ ions in the 2F5/2 level relax to the 2F7/2 level and transfer their energy to the Tm3+ ions, and then the 3H5 level is populated because the Tm3+ ions have no energy level at 980 nm excitation. Thus, the Tm3+ ions in the 3H5 level nonradiatively relax and populate the 3H4 level. Again, the excited Yb3+ ions transfer their energy to pump the Tm3+ ions in the 3F4 level for populating the 3F2 level. The Tm3+ ions in the 3F2 level nonradiatively relax to the 3H4 level, and then, once again, the Yb3+ ions transfer their energy to pump the Tm3+ ions in the 3H4 level for populating the 1G4 level. Finally, the excited ions in the 1G4 level relax to the ground state, 3H6, by producing the blue emission band at 487 nm and some of the ions relax to the 3F4 level by yielding the red emission band at 655 nm.21,22 It is interestingly noticed that, by increasing the pump power, the green and red emission intensities diminished as compared with the blue emission intensity for the Er3+ and Tm3+ ions co-doped with Yb3+ ions. This may hint that there is a possibility of an energy transfer between the Er3+ and Tm3+ ions. When the Er3+/Tm3+/Yb3+ ions are tri-doped, the 4I11/2 level of the Er3+ ions and the 3H5 level of the Tm3+ ions are populated by the energy transfer from the 2F5/2 level of the Yb3+ ions, so there is a chance for an energy transfer from the 4I11/2 (Er3+) level to the 3H5 (Tm3+) level by phonon assistance.23,24 Therefore, we are supposing that, in addition to the Yb3+ ions, the Er3+ ions also act as a sensitizer for the Tm3+ ions in the energy transfer process to enhance the blue emission intensity.
It is necessary to study the dependence of the UC emission efficiency versus pump power to identify how many photons are involved in the excitation mechanism. For this reason, a series of excitation pump powers were applied. On increasing the pump power from 100 to 900 mW, the emission intensity linearly increased with pump power without saturation because there is a quadratic dependence coined between the green (4S3/2, 2H11/2) and red (4F9/2) emitting level populations and the incident pump power. It is well known that, for an unsaturated mechanism, the relationship between the UC emission intensity and the pump power is represented by the following equation of I α Pn, where I is the integrated intensity of the UC emission, P is the pump power, and n is the number of the pumping photons required to excite the RE ions from the ground state to the emitting excited state.25 A plot of logarithm I versus logarithm Pn yields a straight line with the slope of n, as shown in Fig. 7. The values of n for the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 (526 nm), 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (551 nm) and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 (664 nm) transitions of the Er3+ ions single-doped SrY2O4 phosphors are 2.06, 2.04 and 1.48, respectively, as shown in Fig. 7(a), indicating that the two photon process was involved in the green and red UC emission mechanisms. Similarly, the n values of the 1Er3+/5Yb3+ ions co-doped SrY2O4 phosphors were 2.05, 1.83 and 1.73 for the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 (526 nm), 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (551 nm), and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 (664 nm) transitions, respectively, for the green and red emissions (Fig. 7(b)). For the 1Er3+/1Tm3+/3Yb3+ ions tri-doped SrY2O4 phosphors, the n values were 3.02, 2.09 and 1.45 for the 1G4 → 3H6 (487 nm), 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (551 nm) and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 (664 nm) transitions, respectively. The log–log graphs for the blue and green emissions are shown in Fig. 7(c). From the obtained values, it is clear that the three photon excitation process was involved for the blue emission (Tm3+ ions) and the two photon excitation was involved for the green and red emissions (Er3+ ions).

The Commission International De I'Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity coordinates of the Er3+ ions single-doped, Er3+/Yb3+ ions co-doped, and Er3+/Tm3+/Yb3+ ions tri-doped SrY2O4 nanocrystalline phosphors are shown in Fig. 8. Initially, the 1Er3+ ions single-doped sample showed CIE chromaticity coordinates in the yellowish green (0.424, 0.548) region and, by increasing the pump power from 100 to 900 mW, the CIE chromaticity coordinates shifted to the bright green (0.356, 0.635) region as shown in Fig. 8(a). When the 3Yb3+ ions were co-doped with the 1Er3+ ions, the chromaticity coordinates were found in the yellow green (0.34, 0.43) region for 100 mW of pump power which then moved to the greenish yellow (0.376, 0.60) region by increasing the pump power to 900 mW, as shown in Fig. 8(b). In the case of the 1Er3+/1Tm3+/3Yb3+ ions tri-doped SrY2O4 samples, the CIE chromaticity coordinates were obtained in the cool-white (0.314, 0.34) region for 100 mW of pump power. As the pump power was increased from 100 to 900 mW, the CIE chromaticity coordinates were shifted to the cyan (0.248, 0.370) region due to the enhanced blue emission intensity, as can be seen in Fig. 8(c). This type of cyan color emitting oxide-based phosphor is of particular significance in the fields of 3D high-resolution field emission displays.26,27 The corresponding correlated color temperature (CCT) values were also calculated to know the quality of the white light,28 and the obtained CCT values were in the range of 6600–8900 K.

4. Conclusion
The Er3+ ion single-doped, Er3+/Yb3+ ion co-doped and Er3+/Tm3+/Yb3+ ion tri-doped SrY2O4 nanocrystalline phosphors were successfully prepared by the citrate sol–gel method. The XRD patterns confirmed their pure orthorhombic structure and the morphology of the particles was found to be spherical after annealing at 1300 °C. The Er3+ ions single-doped samples exhibited a bright green emission around 551 nm and its intensity was continuously increased without saturation by increasing the pump power from 100 to 900 mW. The Yb3+ ions were co-doped with Er3+ ions in the SrY2O4 host lattice to improve the intensity of the red emission band around 664 nm, thus resulting in a greenish yellow emission under 980 nm excitation. In this co-doped case, two photon excitation processes are involved and the Yb3+ ions transfer their energy to the Er3+ ions in the ground state as well as in the excited state, so that the green emission was dominant. Principally, at 100 mW of pump power, the 1Er3+/1Tm3+/3Yb3+ ions tri-doped SrY2O4 samples displayed a white-light emission and, on further increasing the pump power from 100 to 900 mW, the phosphors exhibited a cyan color emission due to the enhancement of the blue emission. The three photon excitation process was involved for the blue emission band occurred around 487 nm. In this tri-doped case, the Er3+ ions in addition to the Yb3+ ions may also act as a sensitizer for the Tm3+ ions. The quality of the white light was investigated by calculating the CIE chromaticity coordinates and their corresponding CCT values. The achieved results suggest that these phosphors were efficient materials for solid-state lighting applications.
