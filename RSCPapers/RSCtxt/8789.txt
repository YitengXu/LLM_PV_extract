    , Accepted 17th June 2013First published on 12th July 2013AbstractA series of emitting push–pull triarylamine derivatives, models of their widely used homologues in photonics and organic electronics, was investigated by steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopy. Their structural originality stems from the sole change of the electron-withdrawing substituent X (–H: 1, –CN: 2, –NO2: 3, –CHC(CN)2: 4), giving rise to efficient emission tuning from blue to red upon increasing the X electron-withdrawing character. All compounds are highly fluorescent in alkanes. The more polar compounds 2–4 undergo considerable Stokes shift and emission quenching in polar solvents. Femtosecond transient absorption data allowed us to identify the nature of the emissive state which varies as a function of the compound and surrounding polarity. A long-lived ππ* excited state with weak charge transfer character was found for 1. This excited state evolves into a long-lived ICT state with red-shifted emission for 2 in polar solvents. For 3 and 4, the ICT state is directly populated in all solvents. Long-lived and emissive in n-hexane, it relaxes in toluene to a new ICT′ conformation with stronger charge transfer character and enhanced Stokes shift. In more polar THF, ethanol, and nitrile solvents, ICT relaxes to a dark excited state ICT′′ with viscosity-dependent kinetics (<10 ps). The ICT′′ state lifetime drops with increasing solvent polarity (150 ps for 3 in THF, 8.5 ps in butyronitrile, 1.9 ps in acetonitrile), denoting an efficient radiationless deactivation to the ground state (back charge transfer). This result reveals a very small S0–S1 energy gap at the relaxed ICT′′ geometry, with a possible close-lying S0–S1 conical intersection, which suggests that the ICT → ICT′′ process results from a structural change involving a large-amplitude molecular distortion. This fast structural change can account for the strong fluorescence quenching observed for 3 and 4 in polar solvents. Finally, the magnitude of intersystem crossing between the singlet and triplet excited states largely depends on the electron-deficient X unit and the solvent itself. These observations help one conclude on the prevailing role played by the electron-withdrawing groups and the surrounding polarity in the photophysical performances of triphenylamine derivatives, largely employed in numerous emissive solid-state devices.
1. Introduction
Triphenylamine derivatives have aroused considerable interest as precursors of small molecule-based functional materials for applications in two-photon bioimaging and addressing,1–3 organic electronics,4 optical data storage,5,6 and 3D microfabrication.7 They display a low oxidation potential, which makes them attractive as hole-transport layers in organic light emitting diodes8,9 or acid photogenerators upon photoinduced electron transfer for two-photon polymerization.10,11 Compared to their N,N-dialkylamino analogues, the twisted geometry around the nitrogen atom decreases the amino π-donor strength through orbital decoupling12 and imparts efficient fluorescence properties in the solid state, preventing the formation of non-radiative π–π aggregates.13,14 Such properties have been exploited to generate biphotonic addressable fluorescence labels of the DNA quadruplex1 and fluorescent nanoparticles efficiently internalized in living cells.15 More recently, strongly dipolar triphenylamine derivatives have emerged as serious photovoltaic contenders for ruthenium complexes employed in Grätzel's dye-sensitized solar cells,16 leading to a 9.8% overall conversion efficiency.17,18 Surprisingly few studies on the dynamics of triphenylamine compounds in their excited state have been reported, and yet they are of fundamental importance to interpret the photoinduced energy and electron transfers, involved in artificial light-harvesting systems19,20 and photovoltaic devices.21–23 Characterization in the dry solid state with ultrafast spectroscopy is however rather tedious since it requires renewal of the investigated area to avoid photochemical damage caused by repetitive addressing. Systems endowed with similar properties in solution and in the solid state advantageously ease off the technical difficulties and allow straightforward rationalization of the structural engineering to evolve from solutions to thin films or nanoparticles with no loss of photoactivity.24 In this context, we have devised a series of push–pull fluorescent triphenylamine compounds TPX whose emission is little changed in terms of emission wavelength and quantum yield in toluene solution and in the solid state.14 Their bulkiness enabled the fabrication of non-doped thin films amenable to red electroluminescence and laser emission with very weak concentration quenching effects.25,26 Their emission can be varied from blue to red by merely changing the nature of the electron-withdrawing X groups. Most of the systems usually require extensive elongation of the π-conjugated backbone to cover the whole visible spectrum. This in turn can generate additional secondary reaction pathways in the excited state, e.g. E–Z double bond photoisomerization for polyalkene chains, complexifying data interpretations and comparisons.27 The originality of the TPX systems stems from their almost akin structures, and yet their emission characteristics dramatically differ in terms of energy and intensity upon changing the nature of the X group and the solvent polarity.
In order to gain insight into the electronic and geometrical factors ruling these discrepancies, we want to present here a comprehensive investigation of the photophysics and excited-state dynamics of the series of triphenylamine-based TPX compounds 1–4 (Fig. 1) in solvents of varying polarity by using steady-state optical spectroscopy, laser flash photolysis, and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. A preliminary report was focused on the photoinduced processes in compound 4.28 The present paper aims to extend these analyses to compounds 1–3, in order to propose on a comparative basis, a mechanistic scheme for the photophysical pathways followed by the whole family of TPX compounds in solution. The results reveal that the more polar compounds 3 and 4 are promoted to an S1 excited state with strong intramolecular charge transfer character (ICT), which evolves in a few picoseconds in polar solvents toward a distorted geometry probably involving a large-amplitude motion. The strong stabilization of this distorted structure by polar solvents reduces drastically the energy gap between the S1 and S0 potential surfaces and favors ultrafast excited-state depopulation via internal conversion. Finally, tuning of the efficiency of the intersystem crossing (ISC) process by the electron-withdrawing unit has been evidenced. This rather disregarded aspect has recently become of utmost importance owing to the considerable enhancement of OLED performances permitted by delayed-fluorescence, favored by strong interplay between singlet and triplet excited states.29 Despite their structural simplicity, the TPX compounds clearly exhibit complex photophysical behaviors. These studies emphasize the need for careful consideration of the molecular surroundings to avoid inappropriate energy or intensity modifications, causing momentous reduction of the targeted performances especially in blend thin films.

2. Experimental
The synthesis procedure and structural characterization of the triphenylamine compounds 1–4 have been detailed elsewhere.14,30n-Hexane (HEX), toluene (TOL), tetrahydrofuran (THF), acetonitrile (MeCN), butyronitrile (BuCN), octanenitrile (OcCN), methanol (MeOH), and ethanol (EtOH) solvents were of spectrophotometric grade and purchased from Aldrich.
Electrochemical measurements were performed in a three-electrode cell equipped with a 1 mm diameter platinum disk as the working electrode, carbon rod as the counter electrode and Ag+(0.01 M)/Ag as the reference electrode. The reference potential was checked vs. ferrocene as recommended by IUPAC (Eo(Fc+/Fc) = +86 mV). The supporting electrolyte was a 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Fluka, puriss.) solution in dichloromethane. The solutions were deoxygenated by argon bubbling prior to each experiment. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were recorded with a 600 CH Instruments potentiostat connected to a PC.
UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary 5E spectrophotometer. Emission spectra were collected on a Spex Fluorolog 1681 spectrofluorimeter and corrected to the emission of a NIST tungsten lamp. Fluorescence quantum yields were determined from a solution of Coumarine 540 A in EtOH (Φf = 0.38)31 or diphenylanthracene in HEX (Φf = 0.90)32,33 absorbing equally at the excitation wavelength.
Fluorescence intensity decays were measured by the time-correlated single-photon counting method (TCSPC) with a picosecond laser excitation at 330 nm provided by a Spectra-Physics setup composed of a titanium-sapphire Tsunami Laser pumped by an argon ion laser, and doubling LBO crystals and tripling BBO crystals. Light pulses were selected by an opto-acoustic crystal at a repetition rate of 4 MHz. Fluorescence photons were detected at 630 nm through a monochromator by a Hamamatsu MCP photomultiplier R3809U connected to a constant-fraction discriminator. Pulse deconvolution was performed from the time profile of the exciting pulse recorded under the same conditions by using a Ludox solution (instrument response function width 43 ps).
Nano-microsecond transient absorption experiments were performed using a conventional laser flash photolysis setup. Excitation pulses at 266 nm (7–8 ns, 1 mJ) were provided by a 20 Hz Nd:YAG laser (DIVA II, Thales laser). The probe light was provided by a Xe flash lamp (XBO 150 W/CR OFR, OSRAM). Samples (OD value of ≈1.0 at 266 nm) were placed in a quartz cell (10 × 10 mm2 section) and deaerated by bubbling N2 apart from those used for measuring the effect of quenching by O2. The transmitted light was dispersed using a monochromator (Horiba Jobin-Yvon, iHR320) and analyzed using a photomultiplier (R1477-06; Hamamatsu) coupled to a digitalized oscilloscope (LeCroy 454, 500 MHz). Synchronization of excitation pulses and acquisition time was secured using a PCI-6602 8 Channel counter/timer (National Instruments). The experiment was controlled by home-made software written in the LabView environment. Kinetics at each wavelength were accumulated over 9 laser shots. The deconvolution of the individual decays with experimentally measured instrument response function (IRF) lead to 10 ns time resolution. Samples were contained in a quartz cell (10 × 10 mm2 section) at an adjusted concentration (∼10−4 mol L−1) to get an absorption value of about 0.5 at the pump excitation wavelength.
The femtosecond transient absorption setup has been already described elsewhere.34 Briefly, it involves a 1 kHz Ti-sapphire laser system based upon a Coherent (MIRA 900D) oscillator and a BM Industries (ALPHA 1000) regenerative amplifier. Tripling the initial 90 fs pulses at 800 nm (0.3 mm BBO crystal) provided the pump excitation at 266 nm. A probe white light continuum pulse was generated at 800 nm in a CaF2 plate. Pump excitations at 383, 390, and 400 nm were obtained by frequency doubling the Ti-sapphire fundamental tuned at 766, 780, and 800 nm, respectively (0.3 mm BBO crystal). In this configuration, the white light continuum probe pulse was generated with the fundamental laser beam at 766, 780, and 800 nm. The pump pulse power was limited to 2–6 μJ per pulse (0.2–0.6 mJ cm−2). The pump–probe polarization configuration was set at the magic angle. The probe pulse was delayed in time relative to the pump pulse using an optical delay line (Microcontrol Model MT160-250PP driven by an ITL09 controller, precision ±1 μm). The overall time resolution (full-width at half maximum, fwhm of the pump–probe intensity cross correlation) was estimated to be about 350 fs (pump at 266 nm) and 250 fs (pump at 383–400 nm) from the two-photon (pump + probe) absorption signal in pure HEX. The time dispersion of the continuum light was about 350 fs over the 340–720 nm region of analysis (383–400 nm pump excitation) and 400 fs over the 300–675 nm region (266 nm pump excitation). The transmitted light was analyzed using a CCD optical multichannel analyzer (Princeton Instrument LN/CCD-1340/400-EB detector with ST-138 controller). Sample solutions (0.25–1.0 mM) were circulated in a flow cell with 200 μm entrance window thickness and 2 mm optical path length. Data were accumulated over 3 min (∼180000 pump–probe sequences). The characteristic times related to the spectral changes were obtained from exponential fit of the observed kinetics and convolution with the instrument response function.
The molecular geometries were fully optimized by using either the correlation functional of Lee, Yang and Parr35 (B3LYP), or the PBE0 hybrid functional, with a 6-31G(d) basis as implemented in the GAUSSIAN 09 package.36 The latter functional, containing 25% Hartree–Fock exchange, was reported to provide more accurate computations in the theoretical UV-vis absorption spectra for strong charge-transfer compounds as TPX.35,37 Vertical optical transitions were computed through a time-dependent density functional approach (TD-DFT) using the same functional and basis sets. Simulations were performed in the gas phase and in toluene as well, by means of a polarizable continuum model (IEFPCM) to assess the influence of solvent polarity onto the absorption spectra. Both the PBE0 and B3LYP functionals (6-31G(d)) provide very similar energy values and transition energies, in close agreement with the experimental values. Compared to push–pull molecules containing a long π-conjugated bridge, the TPX series displays only one phenyl ring separating the electron-donor unit from the electron-acceptor one. In that case, the risks to overlocalize the electronic density on each unit without considering the participation of the phenyl ring is unlikely.37 Hence, the use of more complex functionals, taking better into account the electronic exchange correlations, would not bring further improvement in the description of the electron density in the ground and excited states and would instead considerably increase the computation costs. The theoretical absorption spectra were reconstructed from the TD-DFT transition energies (λmaxA) and oscillator strengths (f) using Gaussian functions of 40 nm half-height width. Molecular orbital illustrations were obtained with GaussView 3.0.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Geometry and optimization computations
The TPX compounds exhibit an identical di(tert-butylbiphenyl)amino electron-donor group connected to various substituents X with an increasing electron-withdrawing strength from 1 to 4. Whereas the X = H group in compound 1 obviously has no electron-acceptor character, compounds 2–4 display characteristic push–pull structures. The backbones of 2 and 3 closely resemble those of 4-(dimethyl)aminobenzonitrile (DMABN) and dimethylamino-p-nitroaniline (DPNA), respectively, regarded as archetypes of ICT molecules whose widely studied photophysical behaviors are still highly debated.38–48 Nevertheless, two differences can be underlined. First, in the case of the TPX family, the lone pair of the central N atom is delocalized through conjugation with the biphenyl backbone, at the expense of the CT interaction with the phenyl-X moiety. By contrast, the N-methyl groups in DMABN and DPNA exert an inductive electron-donating effect that enhances the CT interaction with the phenyl-X moiety. Second, given the propeller-like structure of the triphenylamino group (in the solid-state28,49 and gas-phase50,51), the electron density of the amino unit is rather distorted to arrange with the π-electron density of each phenyl. This again tends to partly uncouple the central nitrogen lone pair from the phenyl rings and diminish the CT magnitude.
Geometry optimization using DFT computations provides increasing dipole moments from 0.21 D to 11.29 D for 1 to 4 (Table S1, ESI†). Except for 1, they all point along the main direction of the amino-X-substituted phenyl group axis (N–C4). Examination of the N–C1 bond length (Table S1, ESI†) shows a monotonous decrease from 1.413 Å to 1.388 Å for stronger electron-withdrawing groups. In contrast, insignificant changes characterize the N–C5 or N–C5′ bonds connecting the central nitrogen atom to the biphenyl substituents. All these elements attest the strong increase in the ICT interaction with the X electron-withdrawing strength, which is expected to considerably impact the excited-state dynamics after photon absorption (see infra).
3.2. Ground state absorption and electrochemical properties
All compounds display strong absorption in the UV range, invariably centered around 330 nm whatever the solvent polarity (Fig. 2), and higher-energy components below 280 nm. Compounds 3 and 4 show an additional band in the visible range. The latter undergoes a 40 nm bathochromic shift when the nitro unit is replaced with the dicyanovinyl one, and can be reasonably ascribed to a CT band from the central amino group to the X group, despite its insensitivity to solvent polarity.
 Fig. 2  Absorption spectra of compounds 1–4 in HEX (black line), TOL (red line), EtOH (blue line), and MeCN (green line). 
TD-DFT calculations were performed for all compounds on the frontier orbitals HOMO − 1, HOMO, LUMO, and LUMO + 1 in the gas phase and in toluene solutions. Both PBE0 and B3LYP functionals (6-31G(d)) provide very similar energy values and transition energies, in close agreement with the experimental values. They revealed two strongly permitted HOMO → LUMO and HOMO → LUMO + 1 transitions (Table 1, Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†). For all compounds, the HOMO shows π electronic density spread on the central triphenylamino core, and resembles the HOMO of triphenylamine.52 The LUMO is quite confined to the electron-withdrawing substituent for all compounds but 1, clearly underlining the ICT character of the HOMO → LUMO transition in 2–4. For 1, the LUMO actually corresponds to the LUMO + 1 in 2–4 and is mainly localized on the two biphenyl groups, featuring a charge redistribution from the amino group to the peripheral biphenyl substituents.53 Finally, the LUMO + 1 in 1 is largely spread on the entire molecule, pointing to a delocalized ππ* transition. The theoretical transition energies are in fair agreement with the experimental spectra in toluene solution. The values calculated for the aminobiphenyl-centered ππ* transition are consistent with a UV band invariably located at ∼330 nm whatever the compounds in the gas phase or in toluene solution (Table 2). In contrast, the absorption maxima computed for the visible HOMO → LUMO ICT transition show positive solvatochromism from the gas phase to toluene solution as well as a notable red-shift upon going from 2 to 4, as observed experimentally. As clearly seen in the MO energy diagram of 2–4 (Fig. S1, ESI†), such an evolution can be ascribed to a neat decrease of the energy gap due to strong energy stabilization of the LUMO from −1.10 eV (2) down to −2.49 eV (4) whereas the HOMO energy stands around −5.2 eV (Fig. S2, ESI†). It is worth noting that as the LUMO and LUMO + 1 orbitals of compound 2 have similar energy (Fig. S1, ESI†), both the ICT and ππ* transitions are predicted at comparable energy (Table 1), which is consistent with the observation of a single absorption band around 330 nm (Table 2).

The strong energy decrease of the ICT transition observed from 2 to 4 by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, consistent with the TD-DFT calculations, strikingly contrasts with the evolution of the oxidation potentials of the triphenylamino core as a function of X (Table S2, ESI†). As expected, all triarylamine derivatives exhibit a first quasi-reversible oxidation wave peaking at Eo1 = 0.43 V for 1, Eo1 = 0.63 V for 2, Eo1 = 0.69 V for 3, and Eo1 = 0.57 V for 4. A second oxidation wave could be detected above 1.10 V due to the formation of triphenylammonium dications. Reversibility could be recovered only by using a 5–10 V s−1 high scan speed. No correlation could be traced between the optical gap and the first oxidation potential. Contrary to intuitive expectations, compounds such as 3 and 4 presenting a strong intramolecular charge transfer would display higher oxidation potential due to the amine connection to enhanced electron-deficient units. Measurements of the ionization potentials of non-doped evaporated thin films (50 nm-thick) through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirm the absence of correlation. The HOMO levels were valued to be around −5.48, −5.29 and −5.44 eV for 1, 2 and 3 respectively, and −6.43 eV for 4. These values are in good agreement with the HOMO levels calculated for compounds 2 and 3, but drift apart for those related to compounds 1 and 4. This comparison shows that optical and electrochemical data are not simply correlated for charge-transfer molecules whose electronic and structural properties are much influenced by the polarity of the surroundings.
3.3. Steady-state fluorescence and fluorescence decay
All compounds 1–4 exhibit strong fluorescence in alkanes and aromatic solvents of low polarity, as well as in the solid state,14 with quantum yields Φf mostly superior to 0.20. Identical ΦF values are measured for compounds 3 and 4 in hexane (HEX) and toluene (TOL) upon exciting the UV or visible band. The energy absorbed by the (biphenyl)amino moieties upon UV excitation is thus entirely transferred to the emissive ICT excited state as predicted by Kasha's rule. The strong emission of 3 and 4 starkly contrasts with that reported for their N,N-dimethylanilino analogues, known to emit only at low temperatures in rigid matrices.48,54 The nonemissive character of the latter compounds in room-temperature solvents was shown to result from a twisted excited state undergoing ultrafast relaxation to S0via internal conversion (IC). We suspect that stabilization of such a twisted excited-state conformation does not occur for 3 and 4 in apolar solvents, preventing barrierless decay through IC. This point will be discussed later on in view of the transient absorption results.
When going from apolar (HEX, TOL) to polar solvents (MeCN, EtOH), some Stokes shift and solvatochromism in emission are observed for 1, evidencing a more polar structure in the excited state compared to the ground state, but this effect is notably weaker than for compounds 2–4 (Fig. 2), in agreement with the lack of significant ICT character for both the absorption and emission transitions in 1.
Compound 2 exhibits larger positive solvatochromism Δ in emission (from 4900 cm−1 to 9600 cm−1). The remarkable enhancement of Δ compared to that in absorption (Fig. 2 and Table 2) is indicative of a more polar emissive state than the Franck–Condon (FC) one. This suggests that substantial solvent and/or intramolecular solute relaxation takes place in polar solvents following population of the FC excited state. Whereas large solvatochromism is also observed for 3 and 4 in HEX and TOL, both molecules become almost non-fluorescent in acetonitrile and ethanol. This quenching effect indicates that a very fast deactivating radiationless process may occur in these cases. It denotes the presence of a relaxation pathway along the excited state potential surface, which either populates a non-emissive excited conformation (dark excited state) stabilized in polar solvents or brings the molecule to a S1–S0 intersection region where fast internal conversion (IC) can operate, as reported for the N,N-dimethylanilino analogues.48,54 This point will be addressed in more detail in the next section in light of the transient absorption data. It will be seen in particular that, although 3 and 4 are nearly nonfluorescent in polar solvents, a stimulated emission signal could be measured for 4, characterized by a larger Stokes shift compared to that of compound 2, which reveals strongly relaxed S1 state conformation.
Single exponential emission decay of the fluorescence signal (τF = 1.3–4.6 ns) is found for all TPX in HEX and TOL solution except for 3 in HEX. For this latter solution, global analyses provide a biexponential decay characterized by a shorter component at 2.46 ns and a prevailing long component at 4.06 ns whose contribution increases from 53% up to 93% when varying the emission wavelength from 470 nm to 590 nm. The presence of impurities was ruled out after examination of the elemental analyses evidencing high purity. Further studies, beyond the scope of the current comparative studies, tend to suggest the formation of aggregates in alkane solutions as the longer component increased with the solute concentration. When compared to compounds 1 and 2, compounds 3 and 4 systematically show longer singlet excited lifetime τF in HEX and toluene. Calculations of the natural radiative (k0F) and non-radiative (knr) rate constants from the experimental fluorescence decay time (τF) and quantum yield (ΦF) show that k0F is almost one order of magnitude less for compounds 3 and 4 (7.7 × 107, 8.0 × 107 s−1) compared to 1 and 2 (5.6 × 108 and 2.6 × 108 s−1) in cyclohexane. By contrast, the non-radiative constant knr remains in the same range of order (2.1–3.6 × 108 s−1) for all compounds, which lets us assume that radiationless relaxation pathways compete with fluorescence and even prevail for compounds 3 and 4.
In order to gain better insight into the excited-state dynamics related to these steady-state properties, we have performed pump–probe transient absorption spectroscopy measurements in polar and nonpolar solvents. These experiments will help us in particular explain the large solvent-dependent Stokes shift observed for 2–4 and elucidate the mechanism of fluorescence quenching of compounds 3 and 4 in polar solvents.
3.4. Transient absorption spectra
Subpicosecond pump–probe absorption (PPA) spectra of TPX1–4 have been recorded in various solvents in the 0–2 ns time domain. First measurements were performed in the 300–675 nm spectral range following pump excitation of a high energy ππ* excited state Sn at 266 nm. Quite similar transient absorption spectra were obtained for 2–4 in the 340–720 nm range upon excitation at 383 nm (1 does not absorb at this wavelength), confirming the quantitative internal conversion from Sn to the charge transfer excited state S1. The 383 nm excitation falls into the ICT absorption band of compounds 3 and 4 whereas it lies for 2 at the extreme low-energy edge of the superimposed ππ* and ICT bands. To complete these measurements, laser flash photolysis experiments have been carried out in the nano-microsecond time domain following pump excitation at 266 nm. Below we present and discuss successively the results related to compounds 1, 2, and 3, and then compare the photoresponse of compounds 3 and 4 in the light of a recent analysis dedicated to 4.28

Compound 1. 
Typical PPA spectra recorded in HEX at different times following excitation at 266 nm are depicted in Fig. 3. Global fit analysis of the spectral evolution reveals the existence of two time constants τ1 and τ2 (Table 3) corresponding to the short-time and long-time spectral evolutions shown in part A and part B of Fig. 3, respectively. A fast dynamics occurs in the 0–2.5 ps time range (part A), characterized by the decay of a broad transient absorption (TA) band peaking at 370 nm and extending up to the red region, together with the growth of a new TA band with a maximum at 503 nm and a shoulder at 450 nm. In the same time, two negative signals appear at 328 and 376 nm, which match exactly the ground state absorption and fluorescence spectra, respectively (see part C in Fig. 3). They can be readily assigned to ground state bleach (GSB) and stimulated emission (SE) processes. The rise of the SE band at 376 nm and TA band at 503 nm occurs with the same single time constant of τ1 = 0.55 ± 0.07 ps and is likely to characterize the population of the emissive S1 state by internal conversion (IC) from the initially excited Sn state. The kinetics observed for the rising GSB band cannot be related to the ground state depopulation itself, expected to be instantaneously achieved during the pump excitation step. It is instead assignable to the decay of the overlapping TA band of the Sn excited state. At longer time delay (Fig. 3, part B), the GSB, SE and TA bands concomitantly decay with the same single-exponential kinetics of time constant τ2 = 1.35 ± 0.3 ns. The limited accuracy for this decay time is actually due to the pump–probe time delay interval accessible in our femtosecond PPA measurements which cannot be experimentally extended to the whole kinetics. Time τ2 matches quite well the fluorescence decay (τF = 1.30 ns) measured by TCSPC. It can thus be unambiguously correlated with the decay of the excited S1 state population essentially through photon emission (ΦF = 0.73). However, a residual spectrum is determined from the kinetic analysis (dashed trace in Fig. 3, part B), characterized by a broad visible TA band peaking at 570 nm and a negative GSB component at 340 nm. This spectrum is assigned with confidence to the triplet T1 state of 1 populated via intersystem crossing (ISC) (ΦISC ≤ 0.27). Indeed, it resembles reasonably well the transient spectrum measured at longer time decay (1 μs) by means of laser flash photolysis (Fig. 4), which decays totally with a single time constant τT of 3.5 μs in N2-purged HEX, but exhibits dramatic quenching in aerated solution (inset of Fig. 4). The complete disappearance of all transient signals (GSB and TA) at time delays longer than 6 μs attests the full recovery of the ground state population from T1 and the absence of any noticeable photoproduct. The overall photophysical relaxation pathway of 1 in HEX is summarized in Scheme 1. Similar spectral evolution is found in polar solvents such as MeOH (Fig. S3 and S4, ESI†) and MeCN. In all solvents, the excitation populates the same long-lived S1 state (lifetime > 1 ns) that relaxes mainly via emission to S0 and, to a lesser extent, via ISC to the T1 state. The only notable difference in polar solvents relates to an additional dynamical red-shift of the SE band at very short delay times, which is undoubtedly typical of the S1-state solvation process. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), this effect is particularly well evidenced in MeOH whose molecular relaxation dynamics is notably slower than the rise of the S1 state population and clearly discernible experimentally. The dynamical red-shift of the SE signal is responsible for the bathochromic shift of the spontaneous fluorescence spectrum observed upon increasing the solvent polarity (Fig. 2 and Table 2). This effect aside, the results point to a minor influence of the solvent polarity on the excited-state dynamics of 1, which is consistent with the negligible charge transfer character of the S1 ππ* state.

For clarity, the spectral evolution is separated in 2 time domains 0–2.5 ps (A) and 100–1800 ps (B). The pump–probe time delays are given. The −1 ps trace corresponds to the spectral baseline in the absence of pump excitation. The dashed trace is obtained by subtracting the 50 ps spectrum from the 1800 ps one after normalization.

Compound 2. 
The spectral evolution after 266 nm excitation of 2 in HEX solution in the femto/picosecond and nano/microsecond time domains (Fig. S5 and S6, ESI,† respectively) is almost similar to that observed for 1. It can be readily assigned to the ultrafast Sn → S1 relaxation via IC (τ1 = 0.37 ± 0.05 ps) followed by the S1 → T1 transition via ISC (τ2 = 1.81 ± 0.5 ns). The S1 state lifetime τ2 is consistent with the fluorescence lifetime (τF = 1.71 ns) measured by TCSPC. Two differences can be nevertheless noticed in the spectral evolution of 2 relative to that of 1: (i) the rise of the T1 state spectrum in the 300–1500 ps time range is clearer (part B in Fig. S5, ESI†), with an obvious isosbestic point at 535 nm, whereas the GSB decay associated with the S1 state depopulation is less pronounced. This lets us suggest more efficient ISC at the expense of S1 → S0 emission, in accord with the notably lower emission quantum yield of 2 (ΦF = 0.42) compared to 1 (ΦF = 0.73); (ii) the negative SE signal appears weaker, as a dip at 395 nm truncating the broad TA band at the position of the fluorescence maximum (see the 1 ps spectrum in Fig. S5, ESI†). This apparent emission attenuation stems from the red-shifted fluorescence of 2 compared to that of 1, hence (see Fig. 2), both the SE and TA bands strongly overlap. Apart from these slight differences, the general shape and position of the main transient bands are roughly comparable in both compounds, pointing to the similar nature of the excited states of 1 and 2 in HEX: the emissive S1 state is the ππ* state, centered on the aminobiphenyl moieties (TPA → BPh) and not the ICT state. Both the ππ* and ICT transitions are however predicted at very close energy by TDDFT calculations and finding the exact position would require full exploration of the energy surface (Table 1). As evoked above, unlike the situation for compound 1, the S1 state of compound 2 can be directly excited at 383 nm. The corresponding transient absorption spectra in HEX (Fig. S7, ESI†) do not show the ultrafast relaxation that precedes the S1 → T1 ISC process for excitation at 266 nm, which confirms the assignment of this early relaxation to the Sn → S1 IC dynamics. In conclusion, the overall photophysical relaxation scheme of 2 in HEX (part D in Fig. S5, ESI†) is fairly similar to that established for 1 in Scheme 1.
The transient absorption spectra of 2 in polar solvents such as MeOH (Fig. 5) and MeCN (Fig. S8, ESI†) reveal quite distinct photoinduced behaviors compared to those in nonpolar environment. Let us consider in detail the case of MeOH solution. In the early times (≤1 ps, part A in Fig. 5), the spectral evolution is comparable to that observed in HEX and assigned to the Sn → S1 IC process as well (τ1 = 0.28 ± 0.05 ps). The ground state absorption spectra of 1 and 2 are indeed akin to one another, almost insensitive to the solvent, and the same Sn excited state is populated upon excitation at 266 nm (Fig. 2). The 1 ps spectrum resembles obviously the spectrum characterizing the long-lived emissive S1(ππ*) state of 2 in HEX, with a TA band at 470 nm, a GSB band at ∼340 nm nearly matching the ground state absorption spectrum, and a dip in the TA band at around 400 nm, analogous to that noticed in HEX (1 ps spectrum in Fig. S5, ESI†), indicative of the presence of a negative SE signal superimposed on the broad TA band. Thus, in polar as in nonpolar solvents, the Sn state relaxes by IC to the same S1(ππ*) excited state localized on the aminobiphenyl moieties. Whereas this S1(ππ*) state is the long-lived emissive state in HEX, a further spectral evolution occurs within 50 ps in MeOH, characterized by several isosbestic points (Fig. 5, part B). This evolution leads to a new transient spectrum characterized by a main TA band maximizing at 422 nm, a weaker TA band above 600 nm, and a broad spectral depletion at 515 nm, roughly matching the fluorescence spectrum (part D) and thus ascribed to a SE band. Hence, the ππ* state evolves via a thermally activated process toward a new excited state S1′, which is the emissive state stabilized in polar solvents. Global fitting analysis shows that the S1(ππ*) → S1′ kinetics is characterized by a dominant component of time constant τ2 = 2.2 ± 0.3 ps (a minor component τ2′ = 32 ± 5 ps, 7% is also present). The GSB intensity remains practically constant in the 1–50 ps time range, pointing to the absence of ground state recovery during the relaxation process. The red shift of the SE band from ca. 400 nm (S1) to 515 nm (S1′) during this relaxation can account for the notable positive solvatochromism of the steady-state emission (Fig. 2) and the increase of the Stokes shift (ΔνAF in Table 2) on going from HEX to MeOH. Finally, the relaxed S1′ state spectrum decays with a time constant τ3 of 3.2 ± 0.7 ns (Fig. 5, part C) in close agreement with the fluorescence lifetime (τF = 3.76 ns), confirming its assignment to the emissive excited state. A nearly comparable spectral evolution is observed in MeCN (Fig. S8, ESI†) and could be assigned to the successive relaxation processes Sn → S1(ππ*) (τ1 = 0.45 ± 0.07 ps), S1(ππ*) → S1′ (τ2 = 0.8 ± 0.1 ps, 95% and τ2′ = 47 ± 6 ps, 5%), and S1′ decay (τ3 = 4.0 ± 1.0 ns). This analogy denotes the absence of substantial solute–solvent hydrogen bonding effect on the excited-state dynamics of 2. All time constants are listed in Table 3. Finally, flash photolysis measurements in deoxygenated MeCN (Fig. S9, ESI†) and MeOH reveal T1 spectra and lifetimes τT (see Table 3) quite similar to those recorded for 2 in HEX (Fig. S6, ESI†) and for 1 in all solvents (Fig. 4 and Fig. S4, ESI†). The same T1 state of ππ* character is thus populated in 1 and 2, whichever the nature, S1 or S1′, of the precursor singlet excited state.
 Fig. 5  Transient absorption spectra of 2 in MeOH at different pump–probe time delays after excitation at 266 nm. For clarity, the spectral evolution is separated in 3 time domains 0–1 ps (A), 1–50 ps (B), and 50–1500 ps (C). The pump–probe time delays are given. The −1 ps trace corresponds to the spectral baseline in the absence of pump excitation. Reference steady-state absorption (dotted line) and fluorescence (full line) spectra of 2 in MeOH are also given (D). 
The excited-state relaxation process S1(ππ*) → S1′ observed for compound 2 in polar solvents presents strong similarity to the well-known photoinduced ICT reaction of DMABN,38–43 which possesses a donor–acceptor structure analogous to that of 2. In DMABN, the ICT reaction occurs from a higher-energy ππ* state localized on the benzene ring, termed the locally excited LE state, to a highly polar ICT state with red-shifted emission, resulting from some charge transfer from the amine donor group to the benzonitrile acceptor group. As the polarity of the solvent increases, the ICT state is stabilized by solvation. In nonpolar solvents, only the LE state is populated.41 Similarly, in the case of compound 2, the excited S1′ state is populated only in polar solvents from a precursor S1(ππ*) state equivalent to the LE state of DMABN, and is characterized by a notably red-shifted fluorescence compared to that of S1(ππ*). Thus S1′ can be assigned with confidence to an ICT state as in DMABN, stabilized relative to the S1(ππ*) state in polar environment. Accordingly, the overall photophysics of 2 in MeCN and MeOH following S0 → Sn excitation at 266 nm can be described by the ultrafast Sn → S1(ππ*) IC process followed by the S1(ππ*) → S1(ICT) charge transfer reaction, and ultimately the depopulation of the S1(ICT) state by emission and ISC to the T1 state with relative efficiencies of about 1/3–2/3, as summarized in Scheme 2 and Table 3. In nonpolar solvents, the S1(ICT) state lies at higher energy than the S1(ππ*) state and is not populated. In polar solvents, the stabilization of the S1(ICT) state increases with the solvent polarity, leading to a faster excited-state CT process in MeCN (τ2 = 0.8 ps) than in MeOH (τ2 = 2.2 ps). The CT kinetics (τ2) and the lifetime of the S1(ICT) state (τ3) are close to those reported for DMABN in MeCN (4.1 ps and 3.8 ns, respectively).42 Note that the origin of the second, minor component of the S1(ICT) rising kinetics (τ2′), much slower than the characteristic solvation time, remains undetermined. In the case of DMABN, the ICT process is an equilibrated reaction, with the LE → ICT forward reaction being 500 times faster than the ICT → LE backward reaction. A similar equilibrated process is in principle possible for 2. However, in the steady-state fluorescence spectra (Fig. 2) no emission band could be observed in the 400 nm region, where the transient SE signal from the S1(ππ*) state has been identified in the PPA spectra. This indicates a negligible S1(ICT) → S1(ππ*) back reaction.
 Scheme 2  Photophysical relaxation processes of 2 in polar solvents (characteristic times and quantum yields are those measured in MeOH). 
For DMABN, the ICT conformation (planar or twisted N,N-dimethylamino group relative to the phenyl plane) is still highly debated. In the twisted ICT (TICT) state model, π-electronic decoupling of the electron-donor and -acceptor moieties is predicted to result in a nearly full charge separated zwitterionic character, with a low electronic transition dipole moment for the fluorescence.39–41 The weakly emissive nature of the ICT state of DMABN in MeCN (ΦF ∼ 0.03), with a k0F value ∼8 times smaller than that of the LE state,40 supports the hypothesis of a TICT state. The same conclusion was reported for methyl-4-dimethylaminobenzoate (DMABM) for which the k0F(ICT) is ∼25 times smaller than k0F(LE).55 In this respect, 2 differs clearly from DMABN and DMABM by the high fluorescence quantum yield in both polar and nonpolar solvents (ΦF = 0.31 in MeCN and EtOH, 0.42 in HEX) and an ICT k0F only ∼3 times smaller than the LE k0F (Table 2). The strongly emissive character of the S1(ICT) state of 2 may exclude the presence of such an important π-electronic decoupling between the electron-donor and -acceptor subunits, which would not be consistent with a perpendicular conformation. In support of this conclusion, the red-shift of the ICT emission relative to the ππ* emission in MeCN is much smaller for 2 (∼4400 cm−1) than for DMABN (∼7400 cm−1)42 and DMABM (∼8000 cm−1).55 This indicates that the charge separation and conformational change accompanying the ICT reaction are smaller in the case of 2. Such attenuation of the ICT strength in 2 might be due to the presence of the biphenyl groups that, as remarked above, exert a charge withdrawing effect that does not exist in DMABN and DMABM.


Compounds 3 in n-hexane. 
As discussed in Section 3.2, the lowest energy transition of 3 has indisputably an ICT character in all solvents. Roughly comparable femto/picosecond PPA spectra are recorded after excitation directly within the ICT transition at 383 nm or at 266 nm, populating Sn states. Relaxation from Sn to S1 is thus faster than the time resolution of our pump–probe experiment. The only noticeable difference is the observation, in the case of excitation at 266 nm in polar solvents, of a very broad and nearly flat absorption with intensity slightly increasing from 400 to 750 nm persistent after complete excited state decay. Such a broad and structureless absorption is typical of the presence of solvated electron56 and indicates that, in parallel to excited state population, some photoionization takes place under these conditions. To avoid such complication, we consider only the measurements made upon 383 nm excitation in polar solvents.
In HEX solution (Fig. S10, ESI†), the transient spectra following light excitation are characterized by the same global pattern at all times between 0 and 2500 ps, with two negative GSB bands at 320 and 380 nm matching the steady-state absorption spectrum, a sharp TA band at 440 nm, and a broader one peaking above 680 nm. Moreover, they present a spectral dip around 520 nm due to SE, roughly matching the steady-state fluorescence band. These spectra correspond logically to the S1(ICT) excited state. They are indeed different from the S1(ππ*) state spectra of compounds 1 and 2 in HEX, but resemble somewhat the S1′ state spectrum of 2 in polar solvents (50 ps spectrum in Fig. 5), confirming the ICT nature of S1′. The broad TA band lying in the red region is however more pronounced in the case of compound 3. The time evolution of the S1(ICT) spectrum shows a moderate relaxation in the 0–17 ps range (Fig. S10, ESI,† part A), with slight narrowing and increase in peak intensity of the TA and SE bands (τ1 = 1.4 ± 0.2 ps). No well-defined isosbestic points seem to be present. This spectral change cannot be due to solvation since the apolar HEX solvent molecules are not expected to interact significantly with polar solutes. It can be reasonably ascribed to some conformational relaxation from the Franck–Condon S1(ICT)FC level toward the S1(ICT) equilibrium geometry, possibly mixed with some vibrational cooling. However, this evolution is not accompanied by substantial stabilization of the ICT state relative to the ground state since no red-shift of the SE band position is observed (a weak SE blue-shift occurs instead in the first 17 ps time range, probably resulting from the narrowing of the superimposed blue TA band). Thus, the S1(ICT) state does not differ markedly from the initial FC structure and is likely characterized by low charge transfer character and quite a delocalized charge distribution. In a second phase, the 440 nm TA band and SE band decay simultaneously following a single-exponential kinetics of time constant τ2 = 2.8 ± 0.7 ns (Fig. S10, ESI,† part B). Despite the inaccuracy of this value, it is still consistent with the 2.46 ns fluorescence lifetime measured by TCSPC and characterizes thus the S1(ICT) state depopulation. The decrease in intensity of the GSB band at 320 nm is quite weak during the depopulation, which indicates that the radiative and nonradiative excited-state deactivation processes yielding back the ground state are minor. As a matter of fact, the emission quantum yield of 3 in HEX (ΦF = 0.22) is notably smaller than that found for 1 (ΦF = 0.73) and 2 (ΦF = 0.42). It is likely that ISC from S1(ICT) to T1(ICT) is the dominant decay route of S1(ICT) in this solvent. Such an assumption is supported by the detection from nano/microsecond laser flash photolysis measurements of a strong, oxygen-sensitive transient spectrum (Fig. S11, ESI†) assigned without doubt to the T1 state of 3 (τT = 9.1 μs). This T1 state spectrum is mainly characterized by a broad TA band beginning at ca. 500 nm and maximizing above 780 nm, the shape of which being roughly similar to that of the S1(ICT) red TA band in the 500–700 nm spectral domain. The close band shape similarity explains the surprisingly small change in spectral intensity observed in the 500–700 nm region during the S1 → T1 process (Fig. S10, ESI,† part B). The overall photophysics of 3 in HEX can thus be illustrated by the simple Scheme 3.
 Scheme 3  Photophysical relaxation processes of 3 in HEX. 


Compounds 3 in toluene. 
Representative femto/picosecond PPA spectra of 3 in TOL solution following excitation at 383 nm are shown in Fig. 6. Global fit analysis reveals the existence of four time constants (Table 4). The earlier spectrum is similar to that observed for the S1(ICT) state in HEX, as expected, but its evolution is more impressive and can be roughly divided into three time domains. A first relaxation step leads to some increase of the TA and SE bands, as in HEX, and to the apparent decay of the GSB signal (0–1.7 ps range, time τ1, part A in Fig. 6). The GSB decay is likely due to the increase of the overlapping TA band absorbing in the blue region. This step is assigned to a fast S1(ICT)FC → S1(ICT) relaxation from the FC geometry, similarly as in HEX. Simultaneously, the SE band starts to shift to the red. Then, a spectacular spectral change, not observed in HEX, takes place in the following 1.7–50 ps time domain (Fig. 6, part B). The SE band drops in intensity and keeps shifting to the red from a position (λmax ∼ 530 nm) close to that found in HEX at a short delay time (0.4 ps spectrum) to a final position nearly corresponding to the steady-state emission spectrum (λmax = 580 nm), consistent with the larger Stokes shift observed in TOL compared to that in HEX (ΔνAF in Table 2). At a time delay of 50 ps, the presence of a residual spectral dip in the PPA spectra at 580 nm suggests that the SE signal has not completely disappeared. The persistence of a SE signal at long time is consistent with the long-lived emission of 3 in TOL (τF = 2.84 ns). Note that the lower intensity of the relaxed SE band can also arise in part from its increasing overlap with the positive red TA band, which experiences a simultaneous blue shift from λmax > 720 nm at 0.4 ps to 680 nm at 50 ps. In the same time period, the TA band at 462 nm shifts to 455 nm and its intensity decreases partly, as well as the intensity of the GSB signal. Isosbestic points are present at 427 and 492 nm. This 1.7–50 ps spectral evolution is characterized by a biexponential kinetics of time constants τ2 = 2.0 ps and τ2′ = 13.2 ps. On the other hand, the time-dependent SE red-shift (inset in Fig. 6) is also well fitted by a biexponential kinetics with characteristic time constants τshift1 = 1.6 ± 0.3 ps (75%) and τshift2 = 13.2 ± 1.8 ps (25%) that match approximately τ2 and τ2′. These times correspond roughly to the two components of the toluene diffusive relaxation dynamics, 2.16 ps (51%) and 15.21 ps (10%)57 (the inertial relaxation time, 0.16 ps,57 is faster than the time resolution of our experimental set-up). The 1.7–50 ps excited-state dynamics is thus likely to characterize a biphasic thermally activated relaxation process ICT → ICT′, probably controlled by the solvation of the ICT state. Solvation of polar solutes by toluene is attributable to the strong π-electron density of the aromatic ring, as measured by the Kamlet–Taft polarity parameter (π*). In this regard, the lack of such polar solvation in HEX is consistent with the absence of the ICT → ICT′ process. After 50 ps (part C in Fig. 6), the whole spectrum starts decreasing homogeneously with two points of constant absorbance between the opposite evolution of the negative SE signal and the positive TA bands located in the blue and red regions. An approximate time constant of τ3 = 2.1 ± 0.5 ns characterizes the excited-state population decay (fluorescence lifetime τF = 2.84 ns). ICT′ represents thus the emissive state in TOL. From nano/microsecond laser flash photolysis measurements, the T1 state of 3 (τT = 7.3 μs) is characterized by a similar spectrum to that in HEX. Scheme 4 summarizes the photophysics of 3 in TOL.
 Fig. 6  Transient absorption spectra of 3 in TOL at different pump–probe time delays after excitation at 383 nm. For clarity, the spectral evolution is separated in 3 time domains 0–1.7 ps (A), 1.7–50 ps (B), and 50–1500 ps (C). The pump–probe time delays are given. The −1 ps trace corresponds to the spectral baseline in the absence of pump excitation. The area around 383 nm is wiped out due to the pump-pulse related noise. Reference steady-state absorption (dotted line) and fluorescence (full line) spectra of 3 in TOL are also given (D). The inset shows the time-dependent shift of the SE band position (νmax) and the best fit to a sum of two exponential components of time constants τshift1 and τshift2.

 Scheme 4  Photophysical relaxation processes of 3 in TOL. 


Compounds 3 in polar solvents. 
In MeCN and EtOH, the femto-picosecond spectral evolution is completed in a much shorter time period than in HEX and TOL and is rather complex due to the combined effects of multiple band shifts and changes in shape and intensity occurring in this limited time window. In fact, excited-state conformational changes, excited-state depopulation, and vibrational cooling and solvation of the successive excited-state species as well as of the ground state molecules renewed from IC relaxation, are more or less concomitant. The associated kinetics cannot be analyzed globally using a reasonably restricted sum of exponential functions, as it was found for compound 4.28 However, the spectral evolution can be roughly divided into four main steps for which approximate time constants τ1–τ4 can be estimated by averaging the values determined from independent multiexponential fits of the kinetics performed at 10 distinct wavelengths within the various GSB, TA, and SE band positions. These average time constants are listed in Table 4.
In MeCN solution, the four steps of the excited-state dynamics are relatively well distinct from each other as they occur in separated time windows (parts A–D in Fig. 7). Typical kinetic traces are shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†). The shortest event occurs in the 0–0.5 ps time range and is characterized by the increase of the TA and SE bands and the apparent decay of the GSB signal, as observed in HEX and TOL (time constant τ1 = 0.20 ps, part A in Fig. 7). In addition, the SE band undergoes a dramatic red shift with a time constant τshift = 0.3 ± 0.2 ps close to τ1, which corresponds to the solvent relaxation dynamics (〈τs〉 = 0.26 ps58). We assign this fast evolution to the solvation and conformational stabilization of the charge transfer state (S1(ICT)FC → S1(ICT) relaxation). The 0.4 ps spectrum shows a GSB signal at ∼385 nm, a SE band at 585 nm, a strong TA band at 447 nm and a broad TA band maximizing above 750 nm, out of our spectral window. This spectrum is analogous to that observed for the relaxed S1(ICT) state in TOL (5 ps spectrum in Fig. 6). It evolves immediately toward a new spectrum characterized by the total disappearance of both the SE band at 585 nm and the TA band at 447 nm, and the appearance of a novel very broad TA band peaking at about 615 nm (part B in Fig. 7). This evolution resembles the solvent-controlled ICT → ICT′ spectral transformation observed in TOL (Fig. 6, part B) although it is more complete in MeCN. In the case of TOL solution, the SE and blue TA bands of the ICT′ state are still present, albeit attenuated. Such changes also occur faster than in TOL with a time constant τ2 = 0.55 ± 0.1 ps. Let us set τ2 as the time constant related to an ICT → ICT′′ process in MeCN, with ICT′′ being a dark excited state. As it vanishes, the SE band keeps shifting to the red. The full amplitude of this shift cannot be determined as the SE band position becomes delicate to evaluate for times >0.7 ps due to the simultaneous growth of the overlapping 615 nm TA band. A neat isosbestic point is observed at 494 nm and another one might be present at ca. 720 nm, blurred by the dynamic red shift of the SE band. In the following 1.4–7.0 ps time window (part C in Fig. 7), one observes first the end of the 0.55 ps decay kinetics of the 447 nm TA band of the initial ICT state whereas above 500 nm, the rise of the ICT′′ TA band is truncated by its fast decay that occurs with a mean time constant of τ3 = 1.9 ps. Interestingly, in the 430–480 nm region, the 1.9 ps contribution corresponds to a rising component (see kinetic trace B in Fig. S12, ESI†). It indicates that a new transient state is populated from the decay of the ICT′′ excited state, in agreement with the observation of a TA band peaking at ∼460 nm and remaining after the disappearance of the ICT′′ spectrum together with the negative GSB signal at 380 nm. In an ultimate 12–50 ps relaxation step (part D in Fig. 7), both the GSB and 460 nm TA bands decay with a mean time constant of τ4 = ∼5.5 ps. Such a spectral evolution is the typical signature of a vibrational cooling process, the 460 nm TA signal at the red edge of the GSB signal corresponding to the broad absorption of the hot ground state of 3. Upon cooling, the absorption spectrum narrows and shifts to shorter wavelengths, filling up progressively the GSB hole. Accordingly, the τ3 and τ4 kinetics can be associated with depopulation of the dark excited state (ICT′′ → Shot0) and subsequent vibrational cooling kinetics (Shot0 → S0), respectively. The vibrational relaxation process is expected to be associated with conformational relaxation from the distorted structure of the ICT′′ state to the ground state equilibrium structure. The rise and decay of the ICT′′ spectrum are accompanied by some apparent decrease (Fig. 7, part B) and increase (Fig. 7, part C), respectively, of the GSB band intensity, which indicates that the ICT′′ spectrum contains some TA signal at the position of the GSB. The remarkable shortening of the excited-state lifetime when going from nonpolar solvents to MeCN is consistent with the drastic reduction of the fluorescence quantum yield in the latter case and points to efficient nonradiative quenching of S1. An almost imperceptible spectrum persists after the cooling process (t > 50 ps), indicating the existence of a long-lived transient species. This spectrum consists of a weak residual GSB contribution and a broad TA band extending in the red region beyond 700 nm (see the 370 and 585 nm kinetics in Fig. S12, ESI†). A spectrum consistent with the latter is observed by nano/microsecond laser flash photolysis (Fig. S13, ESI†) and assigned to the T1 state of 3 (lifetime τT = 7.3 μs) in regard to the high sensitivity of its lifetime to the presence of O2. This spectrum shows a broad TA band peaking at 725 nm. It bears some resemblance to the T1 state spectrum recorded in HEX and TOL but is much weaker. Thus the efficient nonradiative deactivation of S1 in MeCN is not due to ISC but rather to the existence of an ultrafast IC to the ground state.
 Fig. 7  Transient absorption spectra of 3 in MeCN at different pump–probe time delays after excitation at 383 nm. For clarity, the spectral evolution is separated in 4 time domains 0–0.5 ps (A), 0.4–1.3 ps (B), 1.4–7 ps (C), and 7–50 ps (D). The pump–probe time delays are given. The −1 ps trace corresponds to the spectral baseline in the absence of pump excitation. The area around 383 nm is wiped out due to the pump-pulse related noise. A reference steady-state absorption spectrum of 3 in MeCN is also shown (dotted line). 
In order to examine the effect of solvent viscosity on the excited state dynamics of 3, the data obtained in MeCN were complemented by similar data in BuCN (Fig. S14, ESI†) and OcCN (Fig. S15, ESI†) solvents. The polarity varying inversely with the viscosity within this series of nitrile solvents, further measurements were done in THF (Fig. S16, ESI†), a solvent as viscous as BuCN but much less polar, in order to better discriminate the effects of polarity and viscosity. Finally, measurements in EtOH (Fig. 8), a polar solvent with slow intrinsic solvation properties (〈τs〉 = 16 ps),57 were done to better appreciate the impact of solvation in the excited-state dynamics. Qualitatively, the spectral evolution of 3 after light excitation in BuCN, OcCN, THF, and EtOH is globally analogous to that in MeCN, revealing in all cases a common excited-state relaxation scheme with two main steps: an excited-state reaction from the initial emissive ICT state to a dark ICT′′ state (time τ2) followed by the depopulation of ICT′′ and regeneration of the ground state (time τ3). As seen in Table 4, the τ2 and τ3 values are strongly solvent dependent. Time τ2 is clearly not correlated with solvent polarity but increases with increasing solvent viscosity. On the other hand, time τ3 does not show apparent correlation with solvent viscosity but increases drastically with decreasing polarity. At longer times, the final Shot0 → S0 vibrational/conformational relaxation (time τ4) that follows the ground state recovery is spectrally well discernible in the case of MeCN as the preceding reaction steps (τ2 and τ3) are notably faster. In EtOH and BuCN, the ICT′′ depopulation and ground-state relaxation kinetics are comparable and the corresponding spectral evolutions rather intricate. In these solvents, a weak but undeniable solvent viscosity dependence of τ4 can be accounted for to the contribution in the ground state relaxation process of the back conformational relaxation from the distorted structure of the ICT′′ state to the ground state equilibrium structure. In THF and OcCN, the depopulation of the ICT′′ state is much slower than the subsequent ground state relaxation, which becomes undetectable.
 Fig. 8  Transient absorption spectra of 3 in EtOH at different pump–probe time delays after excitation at 383 nm. For clarity, the spectral evolution is separated in 3 time domains 0–2 ps (A), 2–5 ps (B), and 10–100 ps (C). The pump–probe time delays are given. The −1 ps trace corresponds to the spectral baseline in the absence of pump excitation. The area around 383 nm is wiped out due to the pump-pulse related noise. A reference steady-state absorption spectrum of 3 in EtOH is also shown (dotted line). 
At very short times, similar subpicosecond relaxation dynamics (time τ1) is observed and accompanied, in all polar solvents but EtOH (Fig. 8), by a remarkable dynamic red-shift of the SE band maximum (τshift). The specific behavior in EtOH, for which the solvation dynamics is by far the slowest among all polar solvents used here, suggests that the observed short-time evolution (τ1, τshift) is related to the ICT state solvation (the dark ICT′′ state has no SE signal). In most cases, the SE maximum position can be measured accurately only at the beginning of the shifting dynamics because of the short ICT state lifetime τ2 and the presence of the superimposed ICT′′ TA band rising concomitantly with the SE decay. Thus the τshift values given in Table 4 correspond to the early portion of the dynamics. During this short-time window, the amplitude of the shift (Fig. S17, ESI†) varies strongly with the solvent nature, following the same trend as the mean solvation time constant 〈τs〉. This is particularly true for MeCN and EtOH where strongly dissimilar 〈τs〉 values account for a spectacular difference in amplitude of the SE band shift. In MeCN, the solvation dynamics is ultrafast (〈τs〉 = 0.26 ps) so that the ICT state is almost fully solvated when evolving toward ICT′′. A notable shift of the SE band is indeed observed before its disappearance. In contrast, solvation in EtOH is so slow (〈τs〉 = 16 ps) that the ICT → ICT′′ relaxation takes place from the unsolvated ICT species. Hence the SE band disappears with almost no shift. Moreover, the ICT′′ TA band in the red region grows rapidly during the ICT → ICT′′ process, with an isosbestic point (part A in Fig. 8), and then, in the 1.5–10 ps time range, undergoes a blue-shift from ∼685 to ∼635 nm with no change in intensity (part B in Fig. 8). This shift, not observed in the case of MeCN, can be reasonably assigned to the slow solvation of the ICT′′ state following its fast population. In MeCN, the ICT′′ TA band grows directly at its final position (∼620 nm) and does not show any shift, which is expected because the ICT′′ state is assumed to be solvated as soon as populated. The situation in the other polar solvents is intermediate between these two extreme cases, with a shift dynamics more or less truncated by the decay of the ICT state. More precisely, solvation dynamics is known to be multiphasic.46,47 In MeCN, τshift is close to the mean solvation time constant 〈τs〉, confirming that solvation occurs to a large extent before ICT decay. In the other solvents, the measured τshift values are shorter than 〈τs〉 and correspond rather to the faster components of solvation. In summary, the short-time spectral evolution in polar solvents can be described as resulting from the presence of two more or less concomitant processes depending on the solvents: the solvation of the ICT state, identified by the dynamic red-shift of the SE band, and its decay toward the ICT′′ state.


Excited-state dynamics of 3 in polar solvents. 
Here we discuss in more detail the complex solvent-dependent dynamics of 3 and the nature of the S1(ICT), S1(ICT)′, and S1(ICT)′′ excited states. In all solvents, the initial S1(ICT)FC state was shown to undergo in the subpicosecond time domain (time τ1 in Table 4) an almost barrierless relaxation toward a S1(ICT) state analogous to the S1(ICT) state of 2 in MeCN and EtOH and having conformation close to the S1(ICT)FC one. In HEX, S1(ICT) is the long-lived emissive state (decay time τ2). In more polar solvents, the S1(ICT) lifetime τ2 is much shorter and characterizes a structural evolution toward a less emissive state ICT′ in TOL or a dark state ICT′′ in nitriles, THF and EtOH. The observation that τ2 is viscosity-dependent suggests that the ICT → ICT′′ process involves a large-amplitude distortion. On the other hand, the drastic shortening of the ICT′′ lifetime τ3 with increasing solvent polarity reveals a striking increase of the rate of nonradiative IC to S0, presumably due to a dramatic reduction of the S1/S0 energy gap. This effect would be consistent with the existence of structural changes involving a large-amplitude distortion in the ICT′′ state. In fact such a distortion is expected to strongly displace the minimum of the ICT′′ potential surface close to the ground state surface, itself destabilized at this geometry. This effect is still enhanced by an increasing stabilization of the polar ICT′′ surface minimum as the solvent polarity increases. In the most polar solvents MeCN, BuCN, and EtOH, the presence of a close-lying conical intersection (CI) between the S1 and S0 surfaces could account for the very short (<10 ps) excited-state decay time τ3. Scheme 5 gives a global representation of the excited-state relaxation processes of 3 in HEX, TOL, EtOH, and MeCN, as compared to the relaxation of compound 2. One must keep in mind that, in polar solvents like EtOH and MeCN, this simplified picture is based on the approximate analysis of the spectral evolution according to four distinct steps given in Table 4, although the real evolution is more complex and cannot be analyzed globally. Vibrational relaxation effects, as solvation, are necessarily superimposed and more or less coupled to the different steps of the structural evolution.
 Scheme 5  Excited-state relaxation processes of 2 in HEX and MeCN (A), and 3 in HEX and TOL (B), EtOH (C), and MeCN (D). τi refers to the time constants defined for these solvents in Table 3 (compound 2) and Table 4 (compound 3). ISC processes are not shown for clarity. The λmax of spontaneous emission (Fluo) and, for 3 in polar solvents, of stimulated emission (SE) are given. In EtOH, the excited-state solvation of 3 is slower than the intramolecular twisting dynamics (τ2) and affects the nonemissive ICT′′ state. In MeCN, solvation of the ICT state is faster than the twisting dynamics and leads to a dynamic red-shift of the SE signal (τshift). 
The question about the exact nature of the molecular distortions that occur in the ICT → ICT′ and ICT → ICT′′ processes is not straightforward in such a flexible molecule where multiple large-amplitude reorientational motions can arise. The dark character of ICT′′ could suggest an intramolecular twisting motion leading to a nearly perpendicular arrangement of the electron-acceptor and -donor moieties that become electronically uncoupled (TICT-like state). Indeed, such a twisted conformation is supposed to have an oscillator strength for the radiative ICT transition equal to zero. Two possible twisting motions are possible, namely a twist of the NO2 group, as reported for the para-nitroaniline molecule59 and various nitroaromatics,60–63 or a twist around the N–C1 bond with the nitrophenyl group and NC1C5C5′ plane set in a nearly perpendicular arrangement, as previously suggested for compound 4.28 The last hypothesis is supported by an overall analogy of the spectral evolution of 3 and 4 upon light excitation (see next section). It is also consistent with the fact that the S1(ICT′′) state spectrum of 3 (1.4 ps spectrum in Fig. 7, part C) is quite different from the reported spectrum of the N,N-bis(4-tert-buthylbiphenyl)aniline cation,64,65 expected to be the electronically uncoupled donor moieties in the case of torsion of the NO2 group. Anyway, it is highly probable that the actual mechanism is more complex than simply resulting from relaxation along a single intramolecular torsion coordinate. In the less polar solvent TOL, the ICT′ state transient spectrum of 3 seems to be intermediate between the ICT and ICT′′ spectra. The persistence of an ICT′ SE signal, clearly reduced but not completely extinguished, would suggest that TOL has enough Kamlet–Taft polarity to stabilize a partially twisted ICT′ conformation intermediate between the ICT and ICT′′ structures, with a degree of charge separation higher than in the initial ICT state but less than in the ICT′′ state in polar solvents. In TOL, the minimum of the ICT′ potential energy surface, less shifted and stabilized than the minimum of the ICT′′ surface in polar solvents, would not approach the S0 surface close enough to enable fast excited-state depopulation via IC.


Comparison of the excited-state dynamics of compounds 3 and 4. 
There is a clear analogy between compounds 3 and 4 concerning the electronic and photophysical properties: strong push–pull structure, the same ICT nature of the HOMO → LUMO transition in all solvents, the important solvatochromism effect, and drastic quenching of the fluorescence in polar solvents. A manifest resemblance of the solvent-dependent excited-state dynamics of 3 and 4 is also evidenced from the time-resolved results. The femto-picosecond excited-state dynamics of 4 in HEX, TOL, MeCN, and EtOH solution has been reported previously.28 Typical PPA spectra of 4 following 390 nm excitation in MeCN and EtOH are shown in Fig. S18 and S19 (ESI†), respectively. As the steady-state absorption and emission transitions of 3 and 4 are not located at the same energy in the two compounds (see Fig. 2), the overlapping of TA, SE, and GSB bands leads to different spectral patterns. However, nearly comparable overall spectral evolution is observed for both compounds, revealing essentially similar excited-state relaxation processes. This resemblance is particularly remarkable in the polar solvents MeCN (compare Fig. 7 and Fig. S18, ESI†) and EtOH (Fig. 8 and Fig. S19, ESI†). As a matter of fact, the overall excited-state relaxation scheme established for 3 (Scheme 5) is rather comparable to that proposed previously for 4.28 In HEX, both compounds have a long-lived emissive S1(ICT) state with structure close to the Franck–Condon geometry and weak charge-transfer character. In polar solvents such as MeCN and EtOH, the S1(ICT) state relaxes rapidly toward a structurally distorted, short-lived ICT′′ state with nearly full charge separation. As discussed above, the ICT′′ structure could result from a near-perpendicular arrangement of the di(biphenyl)amino cationic and phenyl-X anionic moieties. The vicinity of the S1 and S0 surfaces at the ICT′′ equilibrium geometry likely accounts for fast IC to the ground state. In TOL, an emissive ICT′ state with structural distortion and charge-transfer character intermediate between the ICT and ICT′′ states is populated from the initial ICT state. Several differences are nevertheless noted between 3 and 4 concerning specific aspects of their excited-state dynamics in polar solvents, which are discussed below.
Some dissimilarities can be explained by the fact that all kinetic steps are slower in the case of 4 (Table 5) compared to 3 (Table 4). For instance, in MeCN, the excited-state relaxation dynamics leading to the distorted ICT′′ dark state (time τ2) increases from 0.55 ps for 3 to 1.5 ps for 4, allowing more complete solvation of the precursor ICT state before its quenching. This can be inferred from the observation of a more extended dynamic shift of the SE signal in 4 (part A in Fig. S18, ESI†). For the same reason, in EtOH, the increase of time τ2 from 1.4 ps for 3 to 9 ps for 4 can account for the observation in the latter case of some SE dynamic shift, completely absent in the case of 3. Indeed, despite the slow mean solvation time of EtOH (〈τs〉 = 16 ps), partial solvation of the precursor ICT state of 4 is possible before it evolves toward the ICT′′ state, whereas ICT′′ is populated directly from the unsolvated ICT state in the case of 3. On the other hand, the ICT′′ → S0 excited-state depopulation kinetics (time τ3) is also slower in 4 than in 3 and appears rather mixed with the final vibrational/conformational ground-state relaxation (time τ4). As a result, even in MeCN, both processes are less clearly distinguishable spectrally from each other for 4 (part D in Fig. S18, ESI†) than for 3 (part D in Fig. 7). Note that, whereas the τ4 values are comprised in a 5–10 ps time range typical of vibrational cooling for 3, they are notably larger for 4 (16–30 ps), suggesting the existence in this case of a slightly higher barrier to the back intramolecular reorientational motion toward the ground state equilibrium geometry.

Another difference between 3 and 4 concerns the emitting properties of the relaxed excited state ICT′′ in polar solvents. In both cases a drastic reduction of the SE band intensity is observed on going from the ICT to the ICT′′ structure, in agreement with the hypothesis of a strongly twisted conformation of the acceptor and donor moieties. Nevertheless, whereas a very weak SE band is still observed in the red region (λmax > 750 nm) for the ICT′′ state of 4,28 the absence of any perceptible SE signal for 3 led us to conclude to a dark ICT′′ state, which could denote a more complete acceptor–donor electronic decoupling in the nitro compound. However such a conclusion has to be taken with caution as it is difficult to discern whether the SE band is really totally missing in the ICT′′ state spectrum of 3 or still present as a weak signal, as in 4, but completely masked by the broad S1 state TA band lying in the red region. For that reason, time-resolved fluorescence measurements would provide more accurate information about the dynamics of the emissive excited-state.
For both molecules 3 and 4, ICT′ is found to be the relaxed emissive excited state structure in the moderately polar solvent TOL. In highly polar solvents, whereas direct ICT → ICT′′ relaxation seems to occur in the case of 3, the ICT′ state of compound 4 could be detected as a local minimum intermediate between the initial ICT and final ICT′′ conformations along the excited-state structural evolution.28 Assuming that similar excited-state structural relaxation pathways occur in both molecules, the sequential ICT → ICT′ → ICT′′ two-step pathway evidenced for 4 could also arise for 3 in polar solvents. The apparent difference in the spectral evolution of 3 and 4 is likely to be due to the larger lifetime of the ICT′ state for 4: the rising kinetics of the ICT′ state (time τ1 in Table 5) and ICT′′ state (time τ2) appear separated. In the case of compound 3, these two reaction steps are merged in a single dynamics (time τ2 in Table 4) and time τ1 corresponds rather to the early relaxation from the Franck–Condon region, S1(ICT)FC → S1(ICT).
Finally, the triplet state spectrum of 4 in HEX and TOL (Fig. S20, ESI†) is clearly weaker than that observed for 3 (Fig. S11, ESI†). Similarly, the T1 state of 3 is well characterized in EtOH and MeCN (Fig. S13, ESI†), despite a S1 state lifetime of only a few picoseconds. It could however not be detected in the case of 4. These observations suggest that the ISC process is much more efficient in the nitro compound than in the dicyanovinylene one. Indeed, the nitro group in nitro-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is well-known to favor strong S1–T1 coupling and photodegradation processes, resulting in high ΦISC values and extremely short S1 state lifetimes.66–70 Therefore, compound 4 is a better emitter than 3 and is probably less subject to photochemical degradation. In this regard, 4 is anticipated to be the most appropriate compound among the investigated series of triarylamine-based TPX molecules for applications to the elaboration of light emitting devices.

4. Conclusion
The combination of optical, electrochemical, and time-resolved absorption and emission experiments complemented by TD-DFT calculations has revealed that the excited-state dynamics of the apparently simple triarylamino compounds 1–4 is very complex and strongly dependent on the nature of the electron-withdrawing group X and the solvent polarity and viscosity. In alkanes, the emission varies from blue to red upon increasing the electron-withdrawing character of X due to strong LUMO stabilization, as evidenced by TD-DFT PBE1PB/6-31G(d) computations. For compounds 2–4, this stabilization effect and the emission red shift increase notably with increasing solvent polarity due to the charge transfer character of the emissive excited state. However, in EtOH and MeCN, the emission quantum yield of 3 and 4 drops by at least 3 orders of magnitude. The results of transient absorption experiments allowed us to propose convincing photophysical schemes that shed light on the emission properties. Compound 1 (X = –H) presents little photoinduced charge-transfer properties and no significant excited-state transformation in any solvent. Compound 2 (X = –CN) behaves as 1 in weakly polar solvents but undergoes fast excited-state intramolecular charge transfer in highly polar solvents to yield a long-lived ICT state with red-shifted emission and large Stokes shift. The most polar compounds 3 (X = –NO2) and 4 (X = –CHC(CN)2) display quite different and more complex behaviors. Contrary to 1 and 2, the lowest energy transition exhibits a charge transfer character in all solvents. In HEX, the ICT state is long-lived and retains a conformation close to that of the Franck–Condon level with low charge-transfer character, as featured by the weak dynamic Stokes shift of the stimulated emission (SE). It is comparable to the ICT state of 2 in polar solvents. In TOL, the ICT state relaxes to a new ICT′ conformation with stronger charge transfer character, still long-lived and emissive. ICT′ is characterized by a notable Stokes shift and partial reduction of the SE signal, which suggests a structure with a larger twist angle between the electron acceptor and donor moieties. In more polar solvents, the excited-state dynamics is much faster and results from at least three main events that are more or less simultaneous and coupled: excited-state solvation, structural evolution from the initial ICT level to a strongly stabilized, nonemissive ICT′′ conformation, and deactivation of ICT′′ to the ground state via internal conversion (IC). Solvation of the ICT state is reflected by a large dynamic Stokes shift of the SE signal whereas the ICT → ICT′′ process leads to an almost complete extinction of this signal. From the observation of a clear dependence of the ICT → ICT′′ kinetics on the solvent viscosity and according to the ultrafast ICT′′ → S0 decay via IC, it is inferred that the ICT′′ state is characterized by a structural change involving large amplitude distortion. The nonemissive character of ICT′′ could suggest a twisting motion leading to a nearly perpendicular arrangement of the acceptor and donor moieties that become electronically uncoupled (TICT-like state). Such a twisted structure, favorable to full charge separation, could explain its stabilization in polar solvents. In a solvent with ultrafast solvation dynamics like MeCN, solvation of ICT occurs almost completely before its relaxation to the ICT′′ state. In EtOH, the chronology is inverted: structural distortion of the unsolvated ICT molecule occurs first, populating the ICT′′ state, and is followed by slower solvation of ICT′′. In other solvents, both events are more concomitant. Finally, the proximity of the S1 and S0 potential energy surfaces at the distorted ICT′′ geometry promotes fast S1–S0 internal conversion (back charge transfer) with a kinetics increasing with the solvent polarity. As a consequence, the ISC and fluorescence processes, which are the main S1 state deactivation routes for compounds 1 and 2 in all solvents and for compounds 3 and 4 in weakly polar solvents, appear radically quenched in polar solvents. These results provide a consistent picture of the photophysics of this family of push–pull triarylamino compounds in solution. However several points remain to be confirmed, such as the nature and conformation of the intermediate ICT′ state of 3 and 4 in TOL, or the TICT character of the ICT′′ state in polar solvents and the nature of the chemical bond involved in the intramolecular twisting dynamics. Complementary investigations such as spectroscopic measurements in rigid matrices at various temperatures, time-resolved fluorescence experiments, and quantum chemical calculations could be very helpful to better understand the molecular distortion occurring along the excited-state relaxation pathway.

 	Fig. 3  Transient absorption spectra of 1 in HEX at different time delays after excitation at 266 nm. For clarity, the spectral evolution is separated in 2 time domains 0–2.5 ps (A) and 100–1800 ps (B). The pump–probe time delays are given. The −1 ps trace corresponds to the spectral baseline in the absence of pump excitation. The dashed trace is obtained by subtracting the 50 ps spectrum from the 1800 ps one after normalization. Reference steady-state absorption (dotted line) and fluorescence (full line) spectra of 1 in HEX are also given (C).

 	Fig. 4  Laser flash photolysis spectra obtained at different time delays from 1 to 17 μs after excitation at 266 nm of a deaerated solution of 1 in HEX (similar spectra are recorded upon excitation at 355 nm). The inset compares the kinetics taken at 580 nm for aerated and deaerated solutions.	 

 	Scheme 1  Photophysical relaxation processes of 1 in HEX.	 

 	Fig. 5  Transient absorption spectra of 2 in MeOH at different pump–probe time delays after excitation at 266 nm. For clarity, the spectral evolution is separated in 3 time domains 0–1 ps (A), 1–50 ps (B), and 50–1500 ps (C). The pump–probe time delays are given. The −1 ps trace corresponds to the spectral baseline in the absence of pump excitation. Reference steady-state absorption (dotted line) and fluorescence (full line) spectra of 2 in MeOH are also given (D).	 

 	Scheme 2  Photophysical relaxation processes of 2 in polar solvents (characteristic times and quantum yields are those measured in MeOH).	 

 	Scheme 3  Photophysical relaxation processes of 3 in HEX.	 

 	Fig. 6  Transient absorption spectra of 3 in TOL at different pump–probe time delays after excitation at 383 nm. For clarity, the spectral evolution is separated in 3 time domains 0–1.7 ps (A), 1.7–50 ps (B), and 50–1500 ps (C). The pump–probe time delays are given. The −1 ps trace corresponds to the spectral baseline in the absence of pump excitation. The area around 383 nm is wiped out due to the pump-pulse related noise. Reference steady-state absorption (dotted line) and fluorescence (full line) spectra of 3 in TOL are also given (D). The inset shows the time-dependent shift of the SE band position (νmax) and the best fit to a sum of two exponential components of time constants τshift1 and τshift2.

 	Fig. 7  Transient absorption spectra of 3 in MeCN at different pump–probe time delays after excitation at 383 nm. For clarity, the spectral evolution is separated in 4 time domains 0–0.5 ps (A), 0.4–1.3 ps (B), 1.4–7 ps (C), and 7–50 ps (D). The pump–probe time delays are given. The −1 ps trace corresponds to the spectral baseline in the absence of pump excitation. The area around 383 nm is wiped out due to the pump-pulse related noise. A reference steady-state absorption spectrum of 3 in MeCN is also shown (dotted line).	 

 	Fig. 8  Transient absorption spectra of 3 in EtOH at different pump–probe time delays after excitation at 383 nm. For clarity, the spectral evolution is separated in 3 time domains 0–2 ps (A), 2–5 ps (B), and 10–100 ps (C). The pump–probe time delays are given. The −1 ps trace corresponds to the spectral baseline in the absence of pump excitation. The area around 383 nm is wiped out due to the pump-pulse related noise. A reference steady-state absorption spectrum of 3 in EtOH is also shown (dotted line).	 

 	Scheme 5  Excited-state relaxation processes of 2 in HEX and MeCN (A), and 3 in HEX and TOL (B), EtOH (C), and MeCN (D). τi refers to the time constants defined for these solvents in Table 3 (compound 2) and Table 4 (compound 3). ISC processes are not shown for clarity. The λmax of spontaneous emission (Fluo) and, for 3 in polar solvents, of stimulated emission (SE) are given. In EtOH, the excited-state solvation of 3 is slower than the intramolecular twisting dynamics (τ2) and affects the nonemissive ICT′′ state. In MeCN, solvation of the ICT state is faster than the twisting dynamics and leads to a dynamic red-shift of the SE signal (τshift).
