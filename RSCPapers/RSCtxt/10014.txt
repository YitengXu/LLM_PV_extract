    , Accepted 24th May 2023First published on 25th May 2023AbstractIn the field of organic display devices, the solution process of organic materials still requires a lot of research in order to realize advantages such as a simple manufacturing process and flexible characteristics. Here, we propose novel small-molecule hole-transporting materials of 1,3,5-tri(10H-phenothiazin-10-yl)benzene (3PTZ) and 1,3,5-tri(10H-phenoxazin-10-yl)benzene (3PXZ) applicable to spin-coating techniques for solution-processed polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs). With optical analysis, electrical analysis, and density functional theory (DFT) modeling, accurate energy band diagrams of 3PTZ and 3PXZ as hole transport layers (HTLs) in the PLED structure were revealed. The current–voltage (I–V) and electroluminescence (EL) results of PLEDs with 3PTZ (3PXZ) HTLs showed enhanced luminance and quantum efficiency. The maximum luminance and quantum efficiencies of PLEDs with the 3PTZ HTL increased 1.4 and 1.76 times compared to those of the reference PLED without a HTL. The 3PTZ (3PXZ) HTLs with the optimal energy band structure exhibited similar performances regardless of the deposition processes like spin-coating and thermal evaporation. Devices based on 3PTZ (3PXZ) materials show 1.2 (1.11) times increased quantum efficiencies compared with that of devices based on poly-TPD, a representative polymer HTL material. Comparing two small molecular materials as a HTL, the PLED with 3PTZ showed 1.08 times increased quantum efficiency compared with the PED with 3PXZ, attributed to the higher electron barrier height of 3PTZ than that of 3PXZ. To investigate parameters for quantum efficiency improvement of PLEDs with small molecular 3PTZ HTL, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and I–V curve fittings were additionally analyzed.
1. Introduction
Organic materials have been used as an active layer or a carrier transport layer of optoelectrical devices because of their specific properties.1–4 In general, polymers have been widely used in optical and electrical fields as active and carrier-transport materials since they have various merits: easy control of the composition ratio, optical properties, and electrical properties. The optoelectronic devices including light-emitting diodes (LEDs), photodetectors (PDs), and solar cells with polymer active layers show impressive performances compared to other optical devices.5,6 Meanwhile, small molecular materials have also been used in solar cells, organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), and PLEDs because of their great colorfulness, flexibility, and efficiency.7–11
Polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs) have attracted considerable attention as they offer many advantages such as flexibility, low power consumption, and color tunability.12–14 Their performances depend on the active layers, electrodes, and carrier transport layers. Especially, the optical and electrical properties of carrier transport layers are crucial to deciding the quantum efficiency of PLEDs.15,16 Therefore, carrier transport layers have been studied to increase the carrier mobility and block carriers crossing between electrodes during radiative recombination processes. In particular, appropriate selection of the hole transport layer (HTL) is essential to determine the efficiency of PLEDs since the electron blocking and hole transport effects by the HTL improve the recombination rate in the active layer of PLEDs. Therefore, to optimize the imbalance between holes and electrons at the active layer, a HTL with high hole mobility and a low hole barrier is needed in the PLED structure.17,18 Polymer materials such as poly(N,N′-bis-4-butylphenyl-N,N′-bisphenyl)benzidine (Poly-TPD) have widely been used as HTLs of PLEDs because of their high mobility and transmittance.19–21 However, these polymer HTLs have issues such as an uneven surface interface, luminance degradation, and difficulties in band-gap alignment,22–24 leading to restrictions in the choice of active or electrode materials compatible with the polymer HTL. Therefore, alternatives for polymer HTLs are required to provide a better design of the PLED structure and ultimately improve the performances of PLEDs.
Previous studies noted that novel small molecular materials like 1,3,5-tri(10H-phenothiazin-10-yl)benzene (3PTZ) and 1,3,5-tri(10H-phenoxazin-10-yl)benzene (3PXZ) are possible candidates for HTLs in the PLED structure because of their p-type semiconducting properties and high hole mobility.25 The phenothiazine (PTZ) and phenoxazine (PXZ) moieties have been currently studied as p-type semiconductors for perovskite solar cells due to their stable oxidized state and p-type semiconducting properties.26–28 Particularly, PXZ possesses a planar molecular structure with a negligible geometry change during the oxidation reaction, leading to faster electrochemical reactions and charge transfer kinetics than PTZ showing a butterfly-like geometry change.25
In order to acquire these small molecular layers with high quality, various coating methods are studied. Spin-coating methods have advantages like their cost-effectiveness and scalability, while in general thermal evaporations have been utilized to deposit the small molecule layers with high purity and an exactly controlled thickness.7,9,29,30 Although the spin-coated layers were known to exhibit lower quality than thermally evaporated layers, some studies of spin-coated layers show a comparable quality to thermally evaporated ones.8,10,11,31–33
In this study, we newly apply novel 3PTZ and 3PXZ small molecular materials as HTLs in PLEDs using spin-coating methods. These attempts using spin coating are for the first time tried in PLED research. Electrical and optical analyses of 3PTZ and 3PXZ for revealing energy band level structures and material properties were performed using ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry (CV), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), inverse photoemission spectroscopy (IPES), density functional theory (DFT) modeling, and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL). To investigate the effects of small molecular HTLs, PLEDs with a 3PTZ HTL or a 3PXZ HTL were fabricated. The characteristics of PLEDs with 3PTZ or 3PXZ are investigated with the current–voltage (I–V) and electroluminescence (EL) measurements. The PLEDs with 3PTZ or 3PXZ HTL show considerably improved quantum efficiency compared to that of PLEDs without HTLs. The enhanced device performances such as maximum luminance, current efficiency, power efficiency, and quantum efficiency are attributed to the balanced carrier transportation revealed from the I–V curve fittings.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
Theoretical modeling was conducted using the Gaussian 09 program package. The energy levels of 3PTZ and 3PXZ were calculated with Becke's three parameters exchange and Lee–Yang–Parr correlation (B3LYP) using the 6-31G(d) basis set for H, C, N, S, and O.34 In order to calculate the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels, molecular geometries of 3PTZ and 3PXZ were calculated using quantum mechanical calculations.
2.2. Fabrication of PLEDs with 3PTZ and 3PXZ as HTLs
PLEDs were fabricated using a simple spin-coating method with white luminescent polymers (Merck PLEDs Materials. GmbH, catalog number SPW-111). The 2.5 × 2.5 cm2 of ITO patterned glass substrates were cleaned by ultrasonication processed with organic solvents of acetone, ethanol, and isopropyl alcohol. The cleaned ITO/glass substrates were treated with UV-ozone for 10 min. Then, the PEDOT:PSS solution was spin-coated onto ITO/glass substrates as a hole injection layer (HIL), followed by annealing at 120 °C for 30 min. To deposit 3PTZ, 3PXZ, and poly-TPD as HTLs on the PEDOT:PSS/ITO/glass, spin-coating methods were employed. 10 mg of 3PTZ (3PXZ) powder and 80 mg of poly-TPD powder were dispersed in 1 mL and 5 mL of chlorobenzene (CB), respectively. The solution of 3PTZ (3PXZ) with 0.01 wt% and poly-TPD with 1.5 wt%, which were spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS/ITO/glass and annealed at 80 °C for 30 min under N2 conditions. For comparison, the 3PTZ (3PXZ) were deposited on a PEDOT:PSS/ITO/glass by thermal evaporations. Subsequently, a white emission polymer SPW-111 (0.7 wt%) in toluene solution was spin-coated onto the HTL layer. Finally, LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm) were deposited on the SPW-111 layer using thermal evaporations. The size of fabricated PLED chips was 10 × 10 mm2.
2.3. Characterization methods
UPS measurements were conducted with a PHI Versa Probe spectrometer using a He I (21.2 eV) discharge lamp. IPES measurements were conducted with a BaO cathode and a band pass filter of 9.5 eV in an isochromat mode. The spectral broadness of UPS and IPES was 0.1 and 0.5 eV, respectively. CV has been applied to determine the energy levels of the 3PTZ and 3PXZ at room temperature with a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. UV-vis absorption spectra of the 3PTZ and 3PXZ films were measured using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2600). To compare the roughness of thin films deposited by the spin-coating method and the thermal evaporation, atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis was conducted. To confirm the delayed carrier lifetime of PLEDs with HTLs, TRPL spectra were obtained using 150 fs pulses derived from a 76 MHz amplified Ti:Sapphire laser. EL spectra and current–voltage–luminance (I–V–L) curves of fabricated PLEDs were investigated using a Keithley-2400 and a Spectra Scan PR-730.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Density functional theory (DFT) of 3PTZ and 3PXZ
Since PLEDs required HTL, hole injection layer (HIL), emission layer, electron transport layer (ETL), electron injection layer (EIL), etc., accurate energy band level information for each layer is required to form optimal energy band alignment. Efficient charge transportation resulting from an appropriately layered PLED structure is critical to improving efficiency. Theoretical modeling and experimental measurements were utilized to obtain a charge barrier height and to testify to a probability of a PLED structure with a small molecular HTL.

Fig. 1 is a schematic illustration of molecular geometries with frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) of 3PTZ and 3PXZ calculated by the DFT method. The FMOs of 3PTZ and 3PXZ were calculated to be −1.17 eV and −1.20 eV for LUMO, and −5.10 eV and −4.78 eV for HOMO, respectively. While 3PTZ and 3PXZ have similar LUMO levels, the HOMO of 3PTZ was 0.32 eV deeper than that of 3PXZ, which is attributable to the difference in electron-donating strength between the sulfur and oxygen atoms in the PTZ and PXZ moiety. This suggest that since the HOMO level of typical active layers is deeper than that of the HTL layer, the barrier between the HOMO level of the 3PTZ HTL and that of the active layer is lower than in case of the 3PXZ HTL.

3.2. Energy states analysis of 3PTZ and 3PXZ
In general, experimental analysis of the electrochemical gap, the optical gap, and the transport gap is utilized to verify the energy states of new materials. UV-Vis spectroscopy and CV measurements were conducted for investigation of the electrochemical and optical gap properties of 3PTZ and 3PXZ as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Using equations with an oxidation initiation potential  and a reduction initiation potential , HOMO and LUMO levels of 3PTZ and 3PXZ are revealed from measured CV results in Fig. S1(a) and (b) (ESI†).35,36 The electrochemical gaps of 3PTZ and 3PXZ are calculated to be 3.05 and 2.88 eV from the measured HOMO (3PTZ: −4.97 eV and 3PXZ: −5.09 eV) and LUMO (3PTZ: −1.92 eV and 3PXZ: −2.21 eV) levels. These electrochemical gaps are likely underestimated due to electrostatic interactions between the ionized molecule and its polarizable environment if calculated from the CV results.37 An estimation of the band-gap properties from an absorbance via UV-Vis spectroscopy is another approach. Fitting the UV-vis spectra with the Tauc equation yielded the optical gaps of 3.31 eV and 3.18 eV for 3PTZ and 3PXZ, respectively.38–40 However, the band-gap calculation based on an absorbance is not practical in small molecular materials as well since the optical gap are systematically lower than the transport gap due to the difference of exciton binding energy.40,41 The precise measurements of the transport gap of 3PTZ and 3PXZ are critical to verify the exact energy states and to confirm the band-gap alignment if they are layered in a PLED structure. In contrast to indirect estimations of the energy gap from the electrochemical and optical gap, a direct measurement of the HOMO and LUMO levels with UPS and IPES analysis is more accurate to calculate the transport gap properties of organic materials because UPS and IPCE measurements are conducted without correction factors.37
To measure the transport gap of 3PTZ and 3PXZ, UPS and IPES measurements were conducted as shown in Fig. 2 and Table S1 (ESI†). The 3PTZ and 3PXZ layers were prepared by a spin-coating method on a silicon substrate. Fitting of the secondary cutoff region in the UPS spectra yielded the work function of 4.473 and 4.516 eV for 3PTZ and 3PXZ, respectively, in Fig. 2(a) and (d). Fig. 2(b) and (e) exhibited that HOMO–Ef of 3PTZ and 3PXZ is 0.952 eV and 0.846 eV and that the HOMO levels of 3PTZ and 3PXZ are −5.425 and −5.362 eV. In Fig. 2(c) and (f), the IPES spectra show Ef–LUMO of 3PTZ and 3PXZ is 2.614 eV and 2.605 eV. The LUMO levels of 3PTZ and 3PXZ are estimated at −1.895 and −1.911. From the HOMO and LUMO levels, exact band-gaps of 3PTZ and 3PXZ can be calculated to be 3.566 and 3.451 eV, which are well-matched with the DFT simulation modeling results above. Considering similar energy states compared with commercial materials,19–21 the 3PTZ and 3PXZ HTL are expected to be alternatives as the HTL of PLEDs.

(i and j) Schematic illustration of the energy band diagram of the PLED structure with 3PTZ and 3PXZ HTLs. 
Through a precise comparison of the band alignment, the difference in energy states between 3PTZ and 3PXZ was confirmed. Fig. 2(g) and (h) indicate the band-gap diagram of 3PTZ and 3PXZ HTLs corresponding to the measured UPS and IPES results. Notably, the LUMO level of 3PTZ is 0.052 eV higher than that of 3PXZ as expected from the DFT calculation above. The HOMO level of 3PTZ is 0.063 eV lower than that of 3PXZ as well.
Since the 3PTZ and 3PXZ HTL have appropriate band positions between the PEDOT:PSS HIL and the SPW-111 active layer, the band of each layer in white emitting polymer SPW-111 based PLEDs can be appropriately aligned as shown in Fig. 2(i) and (j). The SPW-111 active layer was adopted as an active layer of PLED to improve the stability and simplify the PLED structure. The SPW-111 has been widely used as a white emitting polymer or electron-transport layer (ETL) in optical devices because of its optical property and high stability.42–45 In addition, SPW-111 can be used alone as an active layer of a PLED without an ETL layer.44,45 These exhibit that the electron barrier height between the SPW-111 and the 3PTZ (1.05 eV) is higher than that between the SPW-111 and the 3PXZ (0.99 eV). The hole barrier height between the 3PTZ and the SPW-111 (0.38 eV) is smaller than that between the 3PXZ and the SPW-111 (0.44 eV). Therefore, the 3PTZ layer is expected to increase the recombination rate of PLEDs due to an enhanced charge transport resulting from the higher electron barrier height and the lower hole barrier height between the active layer and the HTL. The reason is that electrons trapped by a high electron barrier height of 3PTZ have more chances to recombine with holes moved through 3PTZ compared to those of 3PXZ if a forward bias is applied.
3.3. Comparison of devices with a spin-coated and thermally evaporated 3PTZ HTL
Before applying the proposed small molecule materials to device fabrications with a solution process method, the effects of a deposition method on film morphologies are verified. Among the two small molecule materials, 3PTZ with an optimized energy band structure is prepared with two different methods: a spin-coating method and a thermal evaporation. To investigate the correlation between the electrical and optical properties according to the deposition method, PLEDs were fabricated and analyzed as shown in Fig. 3(a)–(c). Fig. 3(a) shows the I–V curves of PLEDs with the 3PTZ HTL deposited with thermal evaporation and the spin-coating method. The I–V curve shows that the turn-on voltages of both PLEDs are similar. Notably, the measured maximum current density of the PLED with the spin-coated PTZ HTL (2808 cd m−2@12.5 V) is only 9% lower than that of a PLED with the thermally evaporated PTZ HTL (3023 cd m−2@11 V) as shown in Fig. 3(b). To investigate the characteristics of deposited layers, efficiencies are calculated by using electrical and optical performing results of PLEDs. The PLED with the spin-coated 3PTZ shows 1.07 cd A−1@9.5 V of current efficiency, 0.38 lm W−1@8 V of power efficiency, and 0.53%@9.5 V of quantum efficiency. The current efficiency, the power efficiency, and the quantum efficiency increased by 70%, 46%, and 70%, respectively, compared to those of the PLED with the thermally evaporated 3PTZ (0.63 cd A−1@8.5 V of current efficiency, 0.26 lm W−1@7 V of power efficiency, and 0.31%@8.5 V of quantum efficiency). The current efficiency is calculated as a conversion ratio of the maximum luminance from an injected current to the PLED. The power efficiency of PLED means the ratio of the luminance intensity to the applied power.46 The quantum efficiency is the conversion ratio of the number of the photons emitted from the PLED and the number of electrons injected into the PLED.47 The quantum efficiency of PLEDs with the spin-coated 3PTZ is higher in comparison to that of PLEDs with the thermally evaporated 3PTZ since a simplified fabrication with spin-coating methods contributes to fewer damages on PLEDs during deposition processes. Also, Fig. 3(c) shows that the EL spectrum of the PLED is almost similar to that of PLED deposited by the evaporation method. Therefore, the spin-coating method is thought to be an effective method to form 3PTZ and 3PXZ on the PEDOT:PSS/ITO/glass substrate with consideration of the cost-effectiveness and the device performance.

Little performance difference between the two deposition methods is attributed to similar surface morphologies. The measured root means square (RMS) values of the spin-coated and thermal-evaporated 3PTZ layer are 1.011 and 0.842 nm as shown in the AFM images of Fig. 3(d) and (e). In addition, RMS values of spin-coated and thermal-evaporated 3PXZ are 1.612 and 1.295 nm as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The RMS results showed both have similar surface roughness, suggesting a spin-coating method can provide a cheap and fast deposition process of 3PTZ and 3PXZ since the surface morphologies of 3PTZ and 3PXZ are unlikely to be affected by the deposition methods.
3.4. Performance of PLEDs
Poly-TPD is a representative HTL material used in polymer-based PLED devices. To confirm the device applicability of the proposed small molecule materials, the characteristics of poly-TPD material-based and small molecule-based PLEDs were compared and investigated. The thickness of each layer in the PLED with 3PTZ HTL was confirmed by the cross-sectional TEM image as shown in Fig. 4(a), in which the boundary line between spin-coated 3PTZ(3PXZ) and SPW-111 is ambiguous. To measure the exact thickness of the 3PTZ layer, 3PTZ on the Si substrate was prepared. The cross-sectional TEM image indicates the thickness of 3PTZ is about 27 nm as shown in Fig. 4(b). The thickness of 3PXZ also showed similar results compared with that of 3PTZ as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The I–V curves show the current density properties of a reference PLED, a PLED with poly-TPD, a PLED with 3PTZ, and a PLED with 3PXZ. The turn-on voltage (2.5 V) of a reference PLED increased to 3.2, 4.1, and 4.3 V by insertion of a HTL of poly-TPD, 3PTZ, and 3PXZ. The turn-on voltage of PLEDs can be affected by different PLED structures with various carrier transport layers and electrodes.48–50 In this study, the authors investigated the impact of different PLED structures on turn-on voltage, specifically looking at carrier transport layers and electrodes. While several factors can affect the turn-on voltage of PLEDs, such as device conductivity and serial resistance, this study focused on analyzing the effect of electron barrier height on turn-on voltage. The results showed that PLEDs with HTLs (poly-TPD, 3PXZ, and 3PXZ) demonstrated an increase in turn-on voltages with the increasing electron barrier height between the active layer (SPW-111) and the HTL. At forward bias, electrons moving from the n-electrode to the p-electrode are blocked at the active layer by the HTL barrier. To move these electrons to the p-electrode, a high electric field is needed, which brings an increase of turn-voltage in PLED. The highest electron barrier height in 3PTZ resulted in a relatively high turn-on voltage of PLED with the 3PTZ HTL. In Fig. 4(d), PLEDs with HTLs show enhanced maximum luminance compared with the reference PLED as expected. The maximum luminance of PLEDs without a HTL, with poly-TPD, with 3PTZ, and with 3PXZ are 1668 cd m−2 (@11.5 V), 2450 cd m−2 (@9 V), 2808 cd m−2 (@12.5 V), and 2755 cd m−2 (@13 V) as shown Table 1. These results are explained as injected electrons and holes can easily recombine at the active layer due to blocking injected electrons from the n-electrode and an allowance of holes from the p-electrode by the inserted HTL. Notably, the maximum luminance of PLEDs with 3PTZ is 1.15 and 1.02 times larger than that of PLED with poly-TPD and 3PXZ, attributing to an increased radiative recombination rate at the active layer. Due to the larger LUMO–Ef of PLEDs with 3PTZ than PLEDs with poly-TPD or 3PXZ, trapped electrons in the active layer of PLEDs with 3PTZ have more chances to recombine. In addition, 3PTZ have 0.02 and 0.06 eV lower HOMO levels than those of poly-TPD and 3PXZ as shown in Fig. 2(i), (j) and Fig. S3 (ESI†). The lowest HOMO level of 3PTZ resulted in a higher recombination rate in the PLED structure because holes which are easily moved from the p-electrode to the active layer have increased chances to recombine with electrons at the active layer.

A comparison of the electron–photon conversion performances between 3PTZ (3PXZ) and poly-TPD working as the HTL in the PLED structure can be found in Table 1 listing the maximum luminance, the current efficiency, the power efficiency, and the quantum efficiency of PLEDs with each HTL type. The reference PLED shows a current efficiency of 0.62 cd A−1 (9 V), while the current efficiencies of PLEDs with poly-TPD, 3PTZ, and 3PXZ are 0.9 cd A−1 (8 V), 1.07 cd A−1 (9.5 V), and 0.97 cd A−1 (10 V), respectively. Compared to the current efficiency of the reference PLED, those of the PLEDs with poly-TPD, 3PTZ, and 3PXZ increased 1.45, 1.73, and 1.48 times, respectively. The conversion ratio of the luminance from an injected current in PLEDs grew more in the PLED with the 3PTZ HTL than in the PLED with the poly-TPD HTL. The maximum current density of the PLED with poly-TPD (1816.27 mA cm−2@12 V) is 1.65 times higher than that of the PLED with 3PTZ (1102.61 mA cm−2@12.4 V), but the maximum luminance of the PLED with 3PTZ is 1.19 times higher than that of the PLED with poly-TPD. The results of maximum current density and maximum luminance show that the PLED with 3PTZ effectively converts current injections to light emissions compared with the PLED with poly-TPD.
The power and quantum efficiency results show similar trends. The calculated power efficiencies of the reference PLED, the PLED with poly-TPD, the PLED with 3PTZ, and the PLED with 3PXZ are 0.24 lm W−1 (7.5 V), 0.35 lm W−1 (8 V), 0.38 lm W−1 (8 V), and 0.33 lm W−1 (8.5 V), respectively. The power efficiencies of PLEDs with poly-PTD, 3PTZ, and 3PXZ are 1.46, 1.58, and 1.38 times larger than that of the reference PLED. Therefore, the corresponding quantum efficiencies of the reference PLED, the PLED with poly-TPD, the PLED with 3PTZ, and the PLED with 3PXZ are estimated to be 0.3% (8.5 V), 0.44% (8 V), 0.53% (9.5 V), and 0.49% (10 V) from calculations with the measured maximum luminance, current efficiency, and power efficiency. Compared to the PLED with poly-TPD, the power and quantum efficiencies of the PLED with 3PTZ increased 1.08 and 1.2 times, attributed to an increased radiative recombination rate from the insertion of the HTL because of increasing the number of electron–hole pairs in the SPW-111 active layer. Additionally, with different thickness of 3PTZ and 3PXZ, the maximum luminance, current density, power efficiency, and quantum efficiency of PLED with 3PTZ and 3PXZ are shown in Table S2 (ESI†).

Fig. 4(e) shows multiple EL peaks of white PLEDs at 455, 485, 523, 565, and 600 nm with an applied current of 20 mA. A reference PLED without an HTL was utilized to evaluate the contribution of the HTL layer to the EL performance of PLEDs. By comparing the EL performance of PLEDs with and without an HTL layer, the extent of the contribution of the HTL layer to the improvement of EL performance was determined. The EL spectra indicate that 3PTZ and 3PXZ HTLs are not involved in the emission spectra of PLED, which means that the small molecules solely work as an HTL since these peaks are known to be from the active layer (SPW-111) of PLEDs.51 The images of white emission of PLEDs with the 3PTZ (3PXZ) HTL are shown in the insets of Fig. 4(e). Fig. S5 (ESI†) indicates the CIE coordinates of white-emitting reference PLED (0.3411, 0.3669), the PLED with poly-TPD (0.3330, 0.3878), the PLED with 3PTZ (0.3417, 0.3559), and the PLED with 3PXZ (0.3406, 0.3573). The detailed CIE coordinates of PLEDs with variation of applied voltages are shown in Table S3 (ESI†). The reasons for increased EL intensities of PLEDs with 3PTZ and 3PXZ compared to that of reference PLED are the conductivity and band-gap properties of 3PTZ and 3PXZ. In our previous study, the excellent conductivity of 3PTZ and 3PXZ was confirmed as a p-type semiconductor.25 Especially, the band-gap alignment of the PLED with the 3PTZ HTL resulted in a higher number of carriers and more radiative recombinations without changing the emission spectrum. Therefore, the maximum luminance, the current efficiency, the power efficiency, and the quantum efficiency results show that this new small molecular material can be an alternative material for poly-TPD HTLs.
3.5. TRPL results
In general, PLEDs with a shorter carrier lifetime exhibit more frequent recombinations, so it is advantageous for increasing the efficiency. The carrier lifetime characteristics of 3PTZ and 3PXZ were investigated and compared with that of poly-TPD through TRPL measurements. SPW-111/poly-TPD/glass, SPW-111/3PTZ/glass, and SPW-111/3PXZ/glass specimens were prepared. The active layer and HTL layers were deposited with spin-coating methods. The wavelengths of the excitation light source and the monitored light source were at 525 nm. The measured PL decay curves of PLEDs in Fig. 5 were fitted using a bi-exponential function to calculate carrier lifetime. The intensity of the weighted average exciton lifetime (τavr) was calculated from the sum of f1τ1 and f2τ2 where f and τ are the fractional intensity and lifetime. τavr of PLEDs with poly-TPD, 3PTZ, and 3PXZ are 2.02, 2.53, and 2.26 ns, respectively, as shown in Table 2. This indicates that τavr of the PLED with 3PTZ (3PXZ) is longer than that of the PLED with poly-TPD. The τavr of the PLED with 3PTZ is 1.12 times longer than that of PLED with 3PXZ. Though longer τavr of the small molecule might limit the charge transfer and deteriorate the lighting performance of PLEDs, the performance of PLEDs with a small molecule HTL is comparable to that of PLEDs with poly-TPD HTLs as discussed above. Good performances of PLEDs with a small molecule HTL is thought to be a result of the better band-gap alignment. The higher electron blocking barrier height and the lower hole injection barrier height between the active layer and the HTL is the main mechanism of the enhanced luminance in PLEDs with a PTZ HTL.

3.6. Carrier transport mechanism
In order to define the carrier transport mechanism of small molecular material as an HTL of PLEDs, the current density (J)–voltage (V) characteristic curve of PLEDs with 3PTZ is analyzed since PLED with 3PTZ and PLED with 3PXZ show similar I–V characteristics (turn-on voltage and current density). The analysis was conducted with three basic mechanisms: thermionic emission (TE), space-charge-limited current (SCLC), and Folwer–Nordheim (FN) tunneling. These three processes can be expressed in terms of eqn (1)–(3):52–55
(i) Thermionic emission (TE) conduction model (1)(ii) Fowlerc–Nordheim (FN) tunneling theory (2)(iii) Space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) conduction model J ∝ Vα(3)where k, A*, T, ε, φ0, and q represent Boltzmann's constant, Richardson's constant, absolute temperature, dielectric permittivity, barrier height, and electronic charge, respectively. Fig. 6(a) is a log–log plot adapting the SCLC model. Two regions showing different linear slopes were observed and the change of the slope occurs at the voltage of 0.1 V. α is fitted to about 1 in the voltage lower than 2 V, meaning the electrical conduction is governed by Ohm's law.
 Fig. 6  (a) A log–log plot of the current as a function of the applied voltage in the PLEDs with 3PTZ, showing the data fitting for the SCLC conduction mechanism. The inset represents the fitting for the TE. (b) A ln(I/V2) as a function of the 1/V graph fitted for the FN-tunneling mechanism. 
The insert in Fig. 6(a) shows the plot of ln(J) vs. V1/2 where the voltage increases linearly up to 0.1 V with a small step, showing a deviation from a linear increase at higher voltages. From this fitting result, TE can explain the carrier conduction at very low voltages. As the voltage increases over 2 V, α is much higher than 2. Since this value is much higher than 2, corresponding to the trap-controlled SCLC model for ideal materials,56,57 it is believed that the carrier conduction is primarily controlled by the trap control SCLC.
The contribution of FN tunneling can be calculated as follows. ln(I/V2) vs. 1/V is also plotted as shown in Fig. 6(b). As can be seen in Fig. 6(b), the plot of ln(I/V2) vs. 1/V is indeed linear. Therefore, it is believed that the carrier conduction in this region is primarily controlled by the FN tunneling. The FN tunneling starts to increase at 2 V. At forward bias over 2 V, the holes pass through the active layer by FN tunneling, and recombination occurs within the active layer.
3.7. Mobility of 3PTZ and 3PXZ
A carrier transport layer with high mobility contributes to enhancing the performance of PLEDs in terms of the turn-on voltage and the quantum efficiency. To reveal the carrier transport properties of 3PTZ and 3PXZ, the hole mobilities are calculated from I–V results using Mott–Gurney's law. Fig. S6 (ESI†) shows the calculated hole mobilities of 3PTZ and 3PXZ from I-V curve results. The calculated mobility of 3PXZ (3.234 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) is 2.94 times higher than that of 3PTZ (1.098 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). These results can be explained by the difference between an intramolecular reorganization energy of 3PTZ and 3PXZ. The mobilities of 3PTZ and 3PXZ are similar to the reported mobility of poly-TPD (1.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1).58 Like the TRPL results, the mobility of 3PTZ is lower than that of 3PXZ. TRPL measurements provide valuable information about the recombination dynamics of excitons in LEDs, with a longer lifetime typically indicating a lower recombination rate and a degraded EL performance. However, our results demonstrate a discrepancy among the TRPL, the mobility, and the improved EL performance of the PLED employing the 3PTZ HTL, despite a longer exciton decay lifetime. This discrepancy suggests that other factors, such as current injection efficiency and carrier mobility, also play important roles in determining the EL performance. Further analysis revealed that the improved emission performance of the PLED with a 3PTZ HTL is likely due to the band-gap alignment, resulting in a lower interfacial barrier for electrons and an improved current injection efficiency. This improved efficiency contributes to the enhancement of the quantum efficiency of PLEDs. These findings emphasize the importance of considering multiple factors when assessing the EL performance of LEDs and highlight potential benefits of the band-gap engineering in improving their efficiency.
4. Conclusions
DFT modeling studies and UPS-IPES results show that 3PTZ and 3PXZ are suitable for the HTLs of PLEDs considering their band-gap alignment and semiconducting properties. To form a 3PTZ (3PXZ) layer on the active layer (SPW-111) of a PLED, a spin-coating method was adopted in comparison to thermal evaporation. The surface morphologies were similar regardless of the deposition method, indicating that a cost-effective and fast spin coating is favorable in practical applications. The I–V–L results of PLEDs with a 3PTZ (3PXZ) HTL show enhanced maximum luminance, current efficiency, power efficiency, and quantum efficiency compared with those of PLEDs with poly-TPD. The maximum luminance and quantum efficiencies of PLEDs with 3PTZ (3PXZ) HTLs increased 1.15 (1.02) and 1.2 (1.11) times compared to those of PLEDs with poly-TPD, attributed to an increase of the radiative recombination rate by the increased electron barrier height of PLEDs. PLEDs with 3PTZ showed a more effective performance than PLEDs with 3PXZ because of the higher HOMO and the lower LUMO energy levels than 3PXZ. Even with a simple spin-coating process, 3PTZ and 3PXZ small molecular materials show applicability as the HTLs and they are expected to be applied in various optoelectronic fields.
