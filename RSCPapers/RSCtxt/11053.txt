    , Accepted 14th July 2014First published on 14th July 2014AbstractWe report on our investigations on charge transport and recombination in TiO2-based mesoporous solar cells using PbI2 and various perovskite compositions, including CH3NH3PbI3, CH3NH3PbI2Br, CH3NH3PbIBr2, and CH3NH3PbBr3. The mesoporous TiO2 film is about 650 nm thick. Electron microscopy measurements show that no perovskite capping layer is formed on the top surface of the TiO2 film. Intensity-modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopies show that the electron diffusion coefficient and recombination lifetime are governed by the underlying mesoporous TiO2 film and thus do not depend on the perovskite composition. However, replacing the perovskite absorber with PbI2 leads to a diffusion coefficient that is about a factor of 5 slower than that in perovskite-based devices. We also find that TiCl4 treatment of the mesoporous TiO2 film prior to device fabrication substantially reduces the charge recombination kinetics in mesoporous perovskite solar cells.
Introduction
Organometallic halide perovskites (ABX3) are a special class of organic–inorganic layered materials that generally comprise an inorganic framework of corner-sharing BX6 octahedra, where B is usually a divalent metal cation (e.g., Pb2+ and Sn2+) and X is a halogen (I−, Cl−, Br−). The A+ is a small organic cation (e.g., CH3NH3+) to neutralize the total charge. These perovskite materials have recently emerged as a revolutionary class of light-absorbers for solar conversion application. A representative material composition of this absorber family is CH3NH3PbI3 (or MAPbI3). Solar cells using this absorber have demonstrated impressive progress in photovoltaic (PV) cell performance from 3.8% in 20091 to a certified 17.9% in 2014.2 An open-circuit voltage of 1.13 V has been demonstrated with a 1.55 eV bandgap perovskite absorber.3 Halide perovskites consist of Earth-abundant elements and have the capability of bandgap tuning by tailoring their inorganic and organic components.4,5 Moreover, high-efficiency perovskite solar cells can be made by low-cost solution processing, which is ideal for high-throughput scale-up, such as roll-to-roll processing. Despite the rapid progress in device performance, understanding the structural/electronic properties of halide perovskites and the device physics of perovskite-based solar cells is still in its infancy.
Three types of device architectures are normally used for halide perovskites. The first type is adapted from solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), in which the perovskites simply replace the dye molecules to absorb light and 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD) is normally used as the hole transport material (HTM).6 The device also works well in the absence of the HTM layer.7 The second type is a planar structure, in which a thin layer of perovskite is sandwiched between the electron- and hole-contact layers such as TiO2 and spiro-MeOTAD, respectively.8 The third type is a mesoporous-planar hybrid structure consisting of a TiO2 mesoporous layer (filled with perovskites) and a perovskite capping layer. The hybrid structure is generally considered as the mesoporous structure. However, the structure and device characteristics between the hybrid and the mesoporous solar cell architectures differ significantly.9 These different device architectures with various contact materials have attracted enormous worldwide attention during the past two years.3,4,10–22
In the present study, we focus on the mesoporous perovskite solar cells based on 650 nm-thick TiO2 films. Different perovskite compositions are examined, including MAPbI3, MAPbI2Br, MAPbIBr2, and MAPbBr3. Charge transport and recombination properties are examined by intensity-modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopies (IMPS/IMVS). Electron microscopy measurements show that no perovskite capping layer is formed. We find that the electron diffusion coefficient and the recombination lifetime do not depend on the perovskite composition and are governed by the underlying mesoporous TiO2 film. Increasing the amount of Br content in the perovskite composition is found to shift the absorption edge and spectral response toward shorter wavelengths, as a result of the larger bandgap. Replacing the perovskite absorber with PbI2 significantly lowers the device performance. Transport in a PbI2-based cell is about a factor of 5 slower than that in perovskite-based devices. TiCl4 treatment of the mesoporous TiO2 film prior to device fabrication is found to substantially reduce the charge recombination kinetics.
Experimental
CH3NH3I was synthesized by reacting methylamine (33 wt% ethanol solution) and hydroiodic acid (57 wt% in water, Aldrich) at the molar ratio of 1.2:1 in an ice bath for 2 h with stirring followed by vacuum drying and cleaning with ethyl acetate. CH3NH3Br was synthesized by reacting methylamine (33 wt% ethanol solution) and 47 wt% hydrobromide acid at the molar ratio of 1.2:1 in an ice bath for 2 h with stirring followed by vacuum drying and cleaning with acetonitrile. To make the PbI2 precursor solution, 1.000 g PbI2 was dissolved in 2.75 g dimethylformamide (DMF). Four compositions of perovskite solutions were made: the CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution consisted of 0.693 g PbI2 and 0.239 g CH3NH3I in 2.75 g DMF; the CH3NH3PbI2Br precursor solution consisted of 0.693 g PbI2 and 0.169 g CH3NH3Br in 2.6 g DMF; the CH3NH3PbIBr2 precursor solution consisted of 0.551 g PbBr2 and 0.239 g CH3NH3I in 2.6 g DMF; and the CH3NH3PbBr3 precursor solution was made of 0.551 g PbBr2 and 0.169 g CH3NH3Br in 2.8 g DMF.
The fluorine-doped transparent conducting SnO2-coated glass substrate FTO (TEC15, Hartford, USA) was pre-patterned by etching with Zn powder and 25 wt% HCl solution for about 2 min. The patterned FTO substrate was then cleaned by soaking in a base bath (5 wt% NaOH alcohol) for 16 h followed by rinsing with deionized (DI) water and ethanol. The cleaned FTO substrate was subsequently coated with a compact layer of TiO2 by spray pyrolysis using 0.2 M Ti(IV)bis(ethyl acetoacetate)-diisopropoxide in 1-butanol solution at 450 °C, followed by annealing at 450 °C for 1 h. The TiO2 paste based on 20 nm-sized TiO2 nanoparticles was screen-printed using a screen with a 3 μm emulsion thickness on the compact TiO2 layer on the patterned FTO substrates as described previously.23 The printed mesoporous TiO2 film was annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. The average thickness of the mesoporous TiO2 film was around 650 nm as determined using an Alpha-Step 500 surface profiler. The annealed TiO2 films were then soaked in 0.04 M TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min, followed by rinsing with DI water and ethanol, and finally dried under N2. The TiCl4-treated TiO2 films were annealed again at 500 °C for 30 min before use for perovskite deposition. For comparison purposes, some mesoporous TiO2 films were not treated with TiCl4.
Solar cells were fabricated in ambient conditions (unless stated otherwise) as detailed below. The perovskite and PbI2 precursor solutions were spin-coated onto the 650 nm-thick mesoporous TiO2 films on FTO at 2500 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing on a hotplate in air at 100 °C for about 5 min. An HTM solution was spin-coated on the perovskite-covered TiO2 electrodes at 4000 rpm for 30 s. The HTM solution consists of 0.1 M 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD), 0.035 M bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (Li-TFSi), and 0.12 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) in chlorobenzene–acetonitrile (10:1, v/v) solution. Finally, a 150 nm-thick Ag layer was deposited on the HTM layer by thermal evaporation. The active area of each device was about 0.25 cm2.
The crystal structures of the perovskite and PbI2 films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/Max 2200 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation). The UV-vis absorption spectra of these perovskite films were measured using a Cary-6000i spectrophotometer. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the perovskite and PbI2 solar cells were measured with a Keithley 2400 source meter under simulated AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2; Oriel Sol3A Class AAA Solar Simulator), from open circuit to short circuit with a scan rate of 0.02 V s−1. Less than 5% J–V hysteresis was observed when scanned from short circuit to open circuit. Charge transport and recombination properties of the mesostructured perovskite cells were measured by IMPS/IMVS as described previously.24
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the typical top view of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of four different perovskites (i.e., MAPbI3, MAPbI2Br, MAPbIBr2, and MAPbBr3) deposited on 650 nm-thick mesoporous TiO2 films. The SEM images of the mesoporous TiO2 film and PbI2 deposited on the TiO2 film are also given for comparison. The PbI2, MAPbI3, and MAPbI2Br films show essentially the same morphology as the underlying mesoporous TiO2 films. For MAPbIBr2, some cubic crystallites of perovskites are visible on the top surface of the TiO2 film. The crystallites become larger for the all-bromide perovskite (MAPbBr3) film. This is likely caused by the fact that the MAPbI3 has a tetragonal perovskite phase whereas the MAPbIBr2 and MAPbBr3 have a cubic perovskite phase. Despite some isolated perovskite crystallites on the top surface of the TiO2 films, the overall morphology adopted by the Br-containing perovskite films is still primarily the mesoporous structure of the underlying TiO2 film. These top-view SEM images suggest that the perovskite film morphology in this study can be properly described as a mesoporous structure, as described in the Introduction. This observation is further confirmed with the cross-sectional view of the SEM images shown in Fig. 2. No obvious difference is observed for the microstructures of mesoporous TiO2/absorbers (PbI2 and perovskite) films, which is consistent with the conclusion that the morphology of mesoporous films is dominated by the underlying mesoporous TiO2 films.

Fig. 3a compares the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of PbI2 and the perovskites with four different compositions as indicated. The absorption spectrum of MAPbI3 increases sharply as the wavelength decreases from about 800 to 750 nm. The absorption continues to increase (relatively slowly) with further decreasing wavelength. The absorption spectrum of MAPbI3 agrees with our previous studies.23 The optical bandgap determined from the absorption spectrum is about 1.55 eV for MAPbI3. As the amount of Br in the perovskite composition is increased, the absorption edge of the perovskite film shifts towards shorter wavelength. In this case, the bandgap of the Br-containing perovskites is increased to about 1.75 eV for MAPbI2Br, 2.02 eV for MAPbIBr2, and 2.30 eV for MAPbBr3 as compared to MAPbI3. The bandgap values of these perovskites based on mixed I and Br are consistent with previous reports where perovskites were prepared by using the mixed MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 precursors.4 PbI2 shows a strong absorption at a wavelength shorter than 520 nm, corresponding to a bandgap of 2.4 eV. Fig. 3b compares the main characteristic X-ray diffraction (XRD) peak of the four perovskites and the PbI2 film to illustrate the difference between these samples. PbI2 shows the characteristic peak at 12.58°, corresponding to the reflection from (001) planes. For MAPbI3, the main perovskite (110) diffraction peak appears at 14.08°. This diffraction peak shifts to about 14.36° for MAPbI2Br, to 14.68° for MAPbIBr2, and to 15° for MAPbBr3. This shift toward a higher degree angle is a result of the decreased lattice spacing induced by the substitution of larger I atoms with the smaller Br atoms.4

Charge transport and recombination times in mesostructured cells using different perovskite absorbers are investigated by IMPS and IMVS, respectively. Both IMPS and IMVS involve small-amplitude modulation of the photocarrier density around steady-state (under illumination) during the photocurrent and photovoltage measurements, respectively.25 Specifically, IMPS measures the modulated photocurrent response to the modulation of illumination light intensity (usually) at short circuit, whereas IMVS detects the photovoltage response to the modulation of light intensity (usually) at open circuit. Alternative techniques include impedance,26 time-of-flight,27 and open-circuit voltage decay.28Fig. 4 shows the typical Nyquist plots of IMPS and IMVS response curves for the MAPbI3-based solar cell. Other perovskite solar cells and PbI2-based devices show similar response curves, i.e., all IMPS and IMVS plots display a semicircle in the complex plane. The charge transport (or collection) time can be estimated from the expression: τc = 1/2πfc, where fc is the characteristic frequency at the minimum of the IMPS imaginary component. From the transport time τc and the film thickness L, the electron diffusion coefficient D can be calculated according to the expression D = L2/2.35τc.29 Similarly, the recombination time can be determined from τr = 1/2πfr, where fr is the characteristic frequency at the minimum of the IMVS imaginary component.

Fig. 5a shows the effect of perovskite composition on the diffusion coefficient D as a function of photoelectron density (n). The average thickness for the mesoporous TiO2 film is about 650 nm. The transport results of the PbI2-based solar cell are also shown as a comparison. All perovskite cells and the PbI2-based device exhibit the same power-law dependence of diffusion coefficient on the photoelectron density. For dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), such non-linear dependence is usually described as D ∝ Ntot(1/3)−(1/α)n(1/α)−1, where Ntot is the total trap density and α is usually between 0 and 1. This non-linear electron density dependence of the electron diffusion coefficient is attributed to the electrons undergoing multiple trapping and detrapping through a network of trap states across the mesoporous TiO2 electrode film.25 The parameter α is related to the distribution of these trap states.30 Best fits of the data to the power-law dependence (D ∝ n(1/α)−1) yield α = 0.50 ± 0.05 for all samples, including the PbI2-based device. When compared at a fixed electron density (e.g., 1016 cm−3), all perovskite solar cells with different perovskite compositions exhibit similar D values within a factor of two, suggesting that transport is dominated by the properties of the TiO2 film rather than by those of the perovskite layer. The trap distribution is thus not strongly influenced by the composition of perovskites coated on the TiO2 surface. This observation confirms our previous finding that the transport property of MAPbI3-sensitized cells is the same as that of the conventional solid-state DSSCs, in which the electron transport is limited by the trap states associated with TiO2.23 It is worth noting that a recent paper shows that the transport of mesostructured perovskite solar cells depends on the concentration of the perovskite precursors.31 When a relatively high concentration of perovskite precursor solution is used, electrons could also conduct through the perovskite layer. However, when a high-concentration precursor is used, the device architecture has presumably transitioned from the sensitized mesoporous structure to the mesoporous-planar hybrid solar cell structure, which consists of a mesoporous layer (filled with perovskites) and a perovskite capping layer. In this situation, the charge carrier dynamics are likely determined by perovskite rather than TiO2.9 This is different from the film morphology discussed in this study. In contrast to the perovskite solar cells, the PbI2-based device shows a much lower diffusion efficient (about a factor of 5 lower than that of the perovskite solar cells), which implies a much higher trap density (Ntot) of the PbI2-based cell than that of perovskite solar cells. A recent study has shown that for MAPbI3 only shallow traps are likely to be formed because of their low formation energies.15 In contrast, both shallow- and deep-level defects could form in PbI2 films.32 Thus, it appears valuable to eliminate the PbI2 phase from the perovskite materials for the development of perovskite solar cells. This finding has direct implications for device manufacturing.

Fig. 5b shows the effect of perovskite composition on the electron recombination lifetime in mesoporous perovskite solar cells. The voltage-dependence of the recombination lifetime is commonly seen for DSSCs and is associated with faster recombination at higher electron density. The voltage dependence of the recombination kinetics in DSSCs has been explained in detail previously.26 Our recent study shows that the recombination kinetics in mesoporous MAPbI3 cells are comparable to those in mesoporous solid-state DSSCs using standard Z907 dye.23 Consistent with this observation, Fig. 5b shows that, for a given voltage, there is essentially no difference in recombination lifetime among the mesoporous perovskite cells with different perovskite compositions. This implies that for mesoporous perovskite cells, the recombination kinetics are dominated by recombination between the electrons in TiO2 and the holes in spiro-MeOTAD. In contrast to Fig. 5b, a recent study33 using impedance spectroscopy has shown that increasing the Br content of the perovskite composition significantly reduces the recombination resistance and leads to an improved photovoltage for perovskite solar cells. This previous study, however, used a 250 nm-thick mesoporous TiO2 film and a higher precursor concentration. Although the film/cell morphology was not shown, it is likely that a mesoporous-planar hybrid solar cell structure (i.e., a mesoporous bottom layer plus a planar top capping layer) was actually formed rather than the mesoporous structured investigated in our study. Finally, we find that the recombination lifetime for PbI2-based device follows the same voltage dependence but is slightly smaller than for the perovskite cells. This is likely caused by the higher trap density as discussed above.

Fig. 6 shows the effect of TiCl4 treatment (on a 650 nm-thick mesoporous TiO2 film) upon the diffusion coefficient and recombination lifetime for mesoporous perovskite cells. The data for the TiCl4-treated samples are taken from Fig. 5. The TiCl4 treatment of mesoporous TiO2 films is a standard procedure to improve the device performance of dye-sensitized solar cells. The improvement has been attributed to various factors, including improvement of the connection between TiO2 nanoparticles,34 enhancement of the surface roughness of TiO2,35 passivation of surface traps,36 and movement of the TiO2 conduction band position.37 While these studies focused on DSSCs based on a liquid iodide/triiodide electrolyte, a more recent study has shown for spiro-MeOTAD-based solid-state DSSCs that the main effect of TiCl4 treatment is to reduce the recombination kinetics associated with a subtle change of the film morphology.38 Similar to the DSSC fabrication procedure, TiCl4 treatment has also been used for preparing perovskite solar cells.6,7,39–42 However, its impact on charge transport and recombination for perovskite solar cells has not been reported. In this study, MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 are used as examples to understand the TiCl4 treatment effect. We find that the charge transport is not affected by TiCl4 treatment for mesoporous perovskite solar cells (Fig. 6a), whereas the recombination lifetimes for cells based on TiCl4-treated TiO2 films are about a factor of 4–5 longer than those without TiCl4 treatment (Fig. 6b). These results are consistent with the recent study on solid-state DSSCs as mentioned above,38 suggesting that TiCl4 treatment can reduce the recombination kinetics for mesoporous perovskite solar cells. It is well-known that TiCl4 treatment usually increases the surface roughness of mesoporous TiO2 films. The larger surface roughness presumably improves the coating/contact of the perovskites on the TiO2 surface, thus reducing the back-recombination between electrons in the TiO2 network and holes in the spiro-MeOTAD layer.

Fig. 7a shows the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra for the perovskite (MAPbI3, MAPbI2Br, MAPbIBr2, and MAPbBr3) and PbI2-based mesoporous solar cells. The long-wavelength onset of the IPCE spectrum of perovskite solar cell shifts to lower wavelengths with increasing Br content, which is in good agreement with the absorption spectrum for each absorber material (Fig. 2a). Fig. 7b compares the J–V characteristics of mesoporous solar cells using the same set of absorbers as used in Fig. 7a. The short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) value of these solar cells increases in the order of PbI2 < MAPbBr3 < MAPbIBr2 < MAPbI2Br < MAPbI3, which is consistent with the changes of their respective IPCE spectra. In contrast to the significant and systematic changes of the Jsc values, the open-circuit voltages (Voc) of these devices are near 0.8 V. This suggests that the voltage for the mesoporous TiO2-based perovskite solar cell is limited by the conduction band level and density of states of TiO2. When ZrO2 or Al2O3 is used as the scaffold, a higher photovoltage is usually observed,33,43 which presumably results from fewer trap states in these oxides than in TiO2. The photovoltaic (PV) parameters (Jsc, Voc, and fill factor FF and conversion efficiency η) of these devices are shown in Table 1. It is clear that the PbI2-based device shows a much lower efficiency with a poorer fill factor than the perovskite solar cells. Since several approaches for making perovskites could lead to excess PbI2 in the film, it is important to remove PbI2 to achieve good perovskite cells. Moreover, analysis of a recent report44 shows that the conduction band edge of PbI2 is about 0.5 eV above that of MAPbI3. Thus, if PbI2 exists between perovskite and TiO2, it could act as a barrier for charge injection from perovskite into TiO2, which further limits the solar conversion efficiency.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have investigated the influence of perovskite composition upon charge transport and recombination in mesoporous perovskite solar cells based on 650 nm-thick TiO2 films. Four perovskite compositions were examined, including MAPbI3, MAPbI2Br, MAPbIBr2, and MAPbBr3. Electron microscopy measurements indicate that the cell architecture in this study can be properly described as a mesoporous structure inasmuch that no perovskite capping layer is found on the top surface of the TiO2 film. Increasing the amount of Br content in the perovskite composition shifts the absorption edge and spectral response toward a shorter wavelength. The electron diffusion coefficient and recombination lifetime in the mesoporous perovskite cells do not depend on the perovskite composition for the samples investigated in this study. However, we find that transport in the PbI2-based device is significantly slower than that in the perovskite solar cells. Finally, TiCl4 treatment of the mesoporous TiO2 film prior to device fabrication is found to reduce the charge recombination kinetics substantially.
