    , Accepted 13th April 2020First published on 14th April 2020AbstractTwo-dimensional (2D) Dion–Jacobson (DJ) organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskites hold great potential for optoelectronics and solar cells. Interestingly, experimental excited-state lifetime is longer in (3AMP)(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 than (4AMP)(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (3AMP = 3-(aminomethyl)piperidinium, 4AMP = 4-(aminomethyl)piperidinium, MA = CH3NH3+) regardless of the value of n despite 3AMP having a smaller bandgap. Using ab initio nonadiabatic (NA) molecular dynamics combined with time-domain density functional theory, we focus on the n = 2 perovskite and demonstrate that stronger hydrogen bonding interaction and larger octahedral tilting cause significant delocalization of the hole wave function in (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 and accelerates the electron–hole recombination by a factor of 5 compared to (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 due to an increased NA coupling. The inorganic component stretching mode and coupled inorganic and organic collective motions accelerate decoherence to sub-4 fs in the two materials. The simulations rationalize the experimentally observed puzzle of excited-state lifetime in the 2D DJ perovskite and suggest a rational way to optimize the performance of perovskite devices.
1. Introduction
Three dimensional (3D) hybrid organic and inorganic perovskite (HOIP) solar cells have gained intense attention because their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has reached 25.2%1 from an initial value of 3.81%2 within a decade, arising due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties, including a large light absorption coefficient,3,4 high charge mobility,5 long excited-state lifetimes6,7 and diffusion length,8 and superior defect tolerance.9,10 However, lead toxicity and light and thermal instability constitute two major obstacles for their large-scale commercialization.11–13 All inorganic lead perovskites can increase stability but cannot reduce toxicity.14,15 Partially or fully replacing Pb with other elements (Sn, Ge, and Cu) in HOIP, such as MAPbI3 (MA = CH3NH3+), can reduce toxicity and enhance stability simultaneously.16–19 In addition, introducing hydrophobic bulky organic cations into 3D HOIP is another approach to achieve the above two goals in which the 3D framework converts into a two-dimensional (2D) layered structure in order to accommodate bulkier organic spacer cations.20,21 In particular, the 〈100〉-oriented 2D Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) and Dion–Jacobson (DJ) phase perovskites22,23 have emerged as appealing candidates for photovoltaic devices due to their superior moisture resistance and fine-tunable optoelectronic properties,24,25 enabling their applications as solar cells,23,26,27 light-emitting diodes28 and photodetectors.29
RP- and DJ-phase perovskites have the general formula corresponding to A′2An−1MnX3n+1 and A′An−1MnX3n+1, in which A′ and A are organic cations, M is a metal, and X is a halide, and n is the layer-number of octahedra.24 RP perovskites have two monovalent spacer cations. In contrast, the interlayer gap is bridged by only one short bivalent spacer cation in DJ families, where the inorganic layers stack exactly on top of each other.24 In 2014, the first RP phase (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 solar cell appeared with a promising PCE of up to 4.73%26 and reached 18.2% within five years by persistent optimization of materials synthesis and device fabrication.30–32 Our previous theoretical work has rationalized the puzzle of layer-dependent excited-state lifetimes and edge effects on the charge recombination dynamics in RP perovskites.33,34 Owing to the smaller bandgap with the same value of n and a closer interlayer distance compared to the RP phase, DJ-phase perovskite solar cells were subsequently innovated and have realized an explosive growth of PCEs from 7.32% (ref. 23) to 17.9% within only one year,35–38 which shows their interesting excited-state properties and gains substantial research interest.23,39,40
Using time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, Mao et al. observed the significant difference of PL lifetimes in layered DJ (3AMP)(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 and (4AMP)(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3, 4),23 in which 3AMP is 3-(aminomethyl)piperidinium and 4AMP is 4-(aminomethyl)piperidinium. They showed that the electron–hole recombination time scales depend on aromatic diammonium cations, with longer excited-state lifetimes (∼280 ps) of the former case than the latter case (sub-100 ps) regardless of the value of n at room temperature, leading to better charge transport properties and much higher PCEs for the 3AMP-based solar cell than the 4AMP device. The long-lived excited state lifetimes in 3AMP-based systems are hard to understand because the bandgap of 3AMP-based systems is smaller that of 4AMP-based systems. At the same time, 3AMP and 4AMP perovskites are a pair of isomers sharing an identical molecular formula, whose main difference exists in the non-equivalent –CH2NH3+ positions on the pyridine ring. In general, a smaller bandgap favors electron and phonon quanta resonance and enhances nonadiabatic (NA) coupling since it is reverse to the energy gap. And therefore, it is expected that the latter factor constitutes a dominant role affecting the electron–phonon coupling while the mechanism remains elusive. Shortly after, the same group reported same phenomena, including longer PL lifetimes and higher PEC in the 3AMPY-based device (3AMPY = 3-(aminomethyl)pyridinium) than the 4AMPY-based (4AMPY = 4-(aminomethyl)pyridinium) perovskite solar cell, in which 3AMPY and 4AMPY cations are almost the same except for the position of the nitrogen atom in the two cations.39 One may wonder why variation of the position of nitrogen atoms leads to such a significant difference in the excited-state lifetime, which is a key factor that affects the performance of solar cells. To explore the underlying mechanism for the unexpected charge dynamics depending on the location of nitrogen, performing an ab initio time-domain study is required to uncover the electronic structure and electron–hole recombination of the 3MAP- and 4AMP-based systems at the atomistic level and in the time-domain.
Inspired by both experimental and theoretical studies23,38,39 and considering the similar excited-state lifetimes ranging from sub-100 ps for (4AMP)(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 to around 250 ps for (3AMP)(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 with different n values,23 we focus on n = 2 for saving computational cost to investigate the nonradiative electron–hole recombination in the (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 and (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 systems, using a combination of time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT)41,42 and NA molecular dynamics (MD).43,44 Our simulations demonstrate that the different strengths of hydrogen bonds between 3AMP/4AMP and the neighboring [PbI6]4− octahedra in the two perovskites regulate the electronic structure and affect charge carrier dynamics. 3AMP and 4AMP interact with the terminal iodine anions and share two neighboring octahedra, respectively, leading to stronger hydrogen bonding and octahedral tilting in the latter case than the former case. The small octahedral tilting results in strong antibonding interactions, which push up the valence band maximum (VBM) of (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 and decrease the bandgap by about 0.15 eV. In contrast, the significant octahedral tilting in (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 favors the VBM charge density delocalizing onto all I and Pb atoms. While the conduction band minimum (CBM) resides on the Pb atoms of two non-adjacent inorganic layers. The situation creates a large NA coupling. In contrast, the CBM and VBM supported by Pb and I atoms locate on different layers in (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7. The separated charge densities minimize wave function mixing and reduce NA coupling twice more than. The phonon-induced quantum decoherence times are nearly identical since the number of atoms is the same in the two systems. As a result, driven by the Pb–I stretching modes and collective motions of coupled inorganic and organic components and governed by NA coupling, the nonradiative electron–hole recombination proceeds for about 280 ps in (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 and about 60 ps in (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7, showing excellent agreement with the experiment.23 The simulations highlight the importance of charge delocalization in the electron–hole recombination and advance our understanding on the charge–phonon dynamics in DJ perovskites, providing deepened insights for optimizing their photovoltaic and photoelectronic properties via molecular engineering for the designing of high performance 2D perovskite solar cells.
2. Theoretical methodology
To simulate electron–hole recombination in (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 and (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7, we adopt the decoherence-corrected fewest switches surface hopping (FSSH) algorithm43–45 implemented within time-dependent Kohn–Sham theory.42 In mixed quantum-classical dynamics, lighter electrons are treated quantum mechanically while heavier nuclei are described semi-classically.42,46,47 Decoherence represents the breaking of superpositions formed between pairs of electronic states via NA coupling, characterizing nuclear trajectory branching.44 The decoherence time can be estimated as the pure-dephasing time in optical-response theory,48 which has been added to the FSSH algorithm as a semiclassical correction.44 It is necessary to consider the decoherence effect because the decoherence time is significantly shorter than the nonradiative electron–hole recombination time.49,50 This approach has been successfully used to investigate photoexcitation dynamics in condensed-phase materials,33,34,51–57 including 3D perovskites with grain boundaries and chemical dopants and defects with passivations,51–53 2D perovskites with edges34 and layer-dependent charge recombination,33 TiO2 interfaced with semiconducting54 and metallic nanoparticles,55 and black phosphorus with covalently functionalized molecules56 and containing defects.57
Geometry optimization, adiabatic MD and NA coupling calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).58 The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional59 was adopted to describe electronic exchange–correlation interaction and the projector-augmented wave approach60 is used to treat the interactions between ionic cores and valence electrons. A Γ-centered 4 × 4 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh61 and a plane wave energy cutoff of 400 eV were chosen for geometry optimization. A much denser 8 × 8 × 2 k-point mesh is employed for electronic structure calculations. Geometry optimization was stopped until ionic forces were less than 10−3 eV·Å−1. The Grimme DFT-D3 method with Becke–Johnson damping was used to treat the van der Waals interaction within the perovskite.62,63 After geometry optimization at 0 K, both the systems were heated to 300 K with repeated velocity rescaling for 2 ps to equilibrate the geometries. Then, a 6 ps adiabatic MD trajectory was generated for the two systems in a microcanonical ensemble with a 1 fs atomic time step. After that, the NA couplings were computed at the Γ point since the fundamental bandgap across the CBM and VBM is at the Γ point. Iterating the 6 ps NA coupling twice for NAMD simulations obtained a 9 ps time-evolution population decay using the whole 6 ps geometries as initial conditions. In addition to the study of non-radiative electron–hole recombination by the well-established NAMD approach,43,44 it can also be applied to investigate electron/hole transfer and relaxation dynamics. In general, electrons and holes are coupled to different phonon modes, and the density of states in the conduction band differs from that in the valence band in a given energy window. Both the factors affect the electron/hole relaxation and transfer rate. This method has been successfully employed to study electron and/or hole transfer/relaxation dynamics in a broad range of systems,55,64–67 including perovskites interfaced with WS2,64 NiO (ref. 65) and TiO2,66 and TiO2 sensitized with semiconducting67 and metallic nanoparticles.55
The ab initio time-domain NAMD method used in the present work uses standard DFT which includes explicit electron–phonon coupling. The electron correlation effects are incorporated implicitly in the density functional. Proper description of excitonic effects requires the Bethe–Salpeter theory on top of DFT. This method is not completely developed yet due to an extremely high computational cost. Up to now, the time-dependent version of the Bethe–Salpeter theory was applied only to systems with fixed nuclei.68 Currently, the NAMD method used in the present work is the most powerful ab initio approach available for modeling the photoexcitation charge dynamics in large-scale condensed-phase materials.
Spin–orbit coupling (SOC) interaction is important in 2D perovskites,69,70 including (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 and (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7, due to the presence of heavy lead and iodine elements. Previous work shows that the calculated bandgaps of (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7/(4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 at the PBE level with SOC are over three/two times smaller than experimental values of 2.02 and 2.17 eV, respectively.23 In order to obtain an accurate bandgap, one needs to perform simulations with SOC effects combined with hybrid functionals or a GW calculation.71,72 Currently, hybrid functionals and GW theory for periodic systems are too expensive to be combined with the NAMD approach. We prefer the choice of a simple PBE functional because it gives good agreement in bandgaps with the experiment. This approach provided good results in our previous studies of photoinduced charge dynamics on 2D perovskites containing edge states34 and with different layers,33 and MAPbI3 containing grain boundaries73 and localized charges,74 and interfaced with NiO,65 TiO2 (ref. 66) and water.75
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the optimized geometries (left panel) and one representative snapshot of the MD simulation at 300 K (right panel) of (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 (Fig. 1a) and (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 (Fig. 1b). The fundamental structure of the two perovskites contains a corner-sharing [PbI6]4− octahedral bilayer separated by 3AMP or 4AMP cations with MA cation filling in the cages. The optimized geometries show that either 3AMP or 4AMP cations have ordered arrangements and present an edge-to-face interaction with adjacent cations themselves. The obvious difference seen from the middle panel of Fig. 1 demonstrates that the 3AMP and 4AMP cations residing between the two perovskite layers show different orientations arising highly due to the different strengths of the N–H⋯I hydrogen bonding with the terminal iodine atoms, which change the rotation of 3AMP and 4AMP and affect their interactions with the inorganic Pb–I sublattice and thus the electron–phonon interactions. In particular, the calculated average H⋯I distance of the N–H⋯I hydrogen bonds is 3.037 Å for (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 and 2.921 Å for (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 of the optimized geometries, and the average values of the equatorial Pb–I–Pb angles marked in Fig. 1 are 163.28 and 156.28°. When the temperature increases to 300 K, the corresponding hydrogen bond distance and angle are 3.533 and 3.462 Å and 145.81 and 134.34° for the 3AMP and 4AMP perovskite, respectively. The calculated average Pb–I bond length is 3.168 and 3.186 Å for the (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 and (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 at 0 K, in agreement with experimental values of 3.169 and 3.181 Å.23 The canonically averaged Pb–I bond lengths slightly increase to 3.265 and 3.269 Å by a factor of 3.06% and 2.61% when the temperature increases to 300 K. First, a small change in the Pb–I bond length caused by thermal fluctuations indicates that the two systems are stable at room temperature. Second, octahedral titling in (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 is notably significant compared to that in the (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7. Third, strong hydrogen bonding suppresses atomic fluctuations in (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7, manifested by the small variation of the Pb–I bond length.
 Fig. 1  Simulation cells showing the optimized geometries (left panel) and one representative snapshot of the MD trajectory at 300 K (right panel) of (a) (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 and (b) (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7. The schematic diagram (middle panel) characterizes the orientation of 3AMP and 4AMP cations between the two perovskite layers, which highlights the different hydrogen bonds interacting with the iodine atoms of the octahedra. The inorganic Pb–I layers are labelled L1, L2, L3 and L4 in the structures at 300 K. 
Calculations with higher-level functionals, such as HSE06, generally lead to worse agreement with the experiment than those with the PBE functional. It is necessary to combine them with SOC correction.71 The predicted Pb–I bond lengths at the PBE level already agree well with the experimental values at 0 K. As a consequence, we prefer the choice of the PBE functional. Furthermore, the relative variation in bond lengths for the 3AMP and 4AMP perovskites at 0 and 300 K is importantly discussed here. It is expected that the hybrid functional will retain the results obtained from the calculations using the PBE functional. In order to further reflect the influence of thermal fluctuations on the octahedral titling, we averaged overall the MD trajectories of the 3AMP and 4AMP perovskites and computed the Pb–I bond length and Pb–I–Pb angles, as shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† The reported values of both the Pb–I bond length and Pb–I–Pb angles in (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 are longer and smaller than those in the (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7, respectively, exhibiting a pronounced octahedral titling in the 4AMP perovskite due to the presence of a shorter average hydrogen bond distance (3.276 Å) compared to that (3.592 Å) in the 3AMP perovskite, consistent with the analysis of the representative MD trajectory, as shown in Fig. 1b. As a result, significant octahedral tilting in (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 enhances the charge delocalization, which facilitates the increase in the the NA coupling since the inorganic elements constitute the band edge states,34 thus accelerating charge recombination.

Fig. 2a and b show the projected density of states (PDOS) with contributions divided into Pb, I, MA, 3AMP and 4AMP components for both (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 and (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7, computed using the optimized geometries. Similar to 2D RP and 3D MAPbI3 perovskites,33,34,76 the CBM arises from the Pb atoms while the VBM is composed by both I and Pb atoms in the DJ perovskites under investigation. The organic cations MA, 3AMP and 4AMP do not form band edge states, and hence, they affect the NA coupling via hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions. The inorganic Pb–I layer-resolved density of states (LDOS) of the (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 and (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 is shown in Fig. 2c and d. In particular, the CBM and VBM formed by the L1/L3 and L2/L4 inorganic Pb–I layers in (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 are well separated, facilitating charge separation and thus reducing charge recombination. Though the CBM in (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 remains on the L2/L4 layer, the energy offset of the lowest occupied molecular orbitals between L1/L3 and L2L/L4 is too small to drive charge separation. Even worse, the VBM delocalizes on the all inorganic Pb–I layers and the charges are not separated. Both factors facilitate fast charge recombination. The VBM and CBM are separated by a wide bandgap of 1.85 and 1.98 eV for (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 and (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7, respectively, showing excellent agreement with experimentally reported values of 2.02 and 2.17 eV,23 respectively. The linear optical spectra as a function of photon energy are presented in Fig. S2 of the ESI.† The computational details are described in the ESI† and are same as those used in previous studies.77 To obtain the accurate electronic structure and optical properties of metal oxides, employing on-site coulombic interaction on the 3d electrons78 or hybrid functionals combined with SOC interaction is required.79,80 Thanks to the bandgaps produced by the PBE functional being consistent with the experiment,23 we calculated the optical spectra using the PBE functional.59 Fig. S2† demonstrates that the (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 adsorption edge is about 0.15 eV lower than that in (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7, agreeing with the analysis of the PDOS. The smaller bandgap together with the higher intensity of the peak at the absorption edge suggests (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 to be a better choice for photovoltaics than (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7. As suggested by Amat et al.,72 partial replacement of MA with FA in MAPbI3 leads to a slight bandgap reduction, probably due to the reduced octahedral titling. Similarly, smaller octahedral titling in the 3AMP perovskite, reflected by the larger equatorial Pb–I–Pb tilting angles, favors more overlap between Pb and I orbitals.23 As a result, the increased antibonding interaction causes VBM upshift, thus decreasing the bandgap. This feature is reflected by the schematic diagram of the electronic coupling between the Pb and I atomic orbitals in the (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 and (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 perovskites, shown in Fig. S2.† Indeed, stronger antibonding interaction between Pb 6s and I 5p orbitals in 3AMP pushes up the VBM. In perovskite oxides, the octahedral tiling and rotation can bring about interesting phenomena other than bandgap reduction, including the stabilization of high-spin configurations and the presence of macroscopic magnetism in epitaxial heterojunctions,81 the formation of unusual coupling at heterointerfaces,82 and the influence of remnant polarization and transition temperature on CaTiO3 ferroelectrics.83 A smaller bandgap favors the (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 system to increase NA coupling and accelerates charge recombination.84 But this is not the case in the experiment23 and we will discuss the underlying mechanism below.
 Fig. 2  Projected density of states (PDOS) and inorganic Pb–I layer-resolved density of states (LDOS) of (a, c) (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 and (b, d) (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 systems obtained using the optimized geometries. The contributions to the PDOS are split into Pb, I, MA, 3AMP and 4AMP components in the two perovskites. Pb atomic orbitals dominate the CBM while both Pb and I atomic orbitals contribute to the VBM. The LDOS shows that the inorganic Pb–I layers of L1/L3 and L2/L4 contribute to the CBM and VBM in the 3AMP perovskite, respectively. The CBM of the 4AMP perovskite remains on the L1/L3 layer, while the VBM delocalizes on the all inorganic Pb–I layers. L1–L4 are marked in Fig. 1. The dashed lines represent the Fermi level. 
In addition to the bandgap, the magnitude of the NA coupling between the CBM and the VBM determines primarily the nonradiative electron–hole recombination rate, which is proportional to the wave function mixing, <φCBM|∇R|φVBM′>. Fig. 3 shows the charge densities of the VBM and CBM. In (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7, Fig. 3a shows that the CBM and VBM are supported by Pb and I/Pb atoms residing on inorganic L1/L3 and L2/L4 layers, respectively. On the one hand, the well spatially separated states facilitate charge separation. On the other hand, the feature reduces the overlap of two wave functions, leading to a small NA coupling, 0.370 meV, as shown in Table 1. Similarity, Fig. 3b demonstrates that the charge density of the CBM in (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 remains unchanged, which locates on the inorganic L1/L3 layers. However, the charge density of the VBM is uniformly delocalized on the Pb and I atoms of the whole inorganic layers arising due to the strong hybridization of Pb–I orbitals. The situation increases wave function mixing and enhances the NA coupling to 0.851 meV, as shown in Table 1. Smaller NA coupling and separated electrons and holes suppress the nonradiative electron–hole recombination in (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7.

The CBM and VBM of the (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 are supported by the inorganic Pb–I L1/L3 and L2/L4 layers, respectively. This remains true for the CBM in (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 while the VBM delocalizes on all inorganic Pb–I layers. The increased wave function mixing in the (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 enhances NA coupling and accelerates nonradiative electron–hole recombination.

In order to identify the phonon modes that are coupled to the electronic subsystem, we computed the spectral density by performing Fourier transforms (FTs) of the autocorrelation functions for the bandgap fluctuations. Fig. 4 shows that low frequency vibrations dominate the entire spectra. This is because the band edge states are supported by the heavy and slow Pb and I atoms. The fast motions from the organic cations are coupled to charge carriers via hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions. As exhibited in Fig. 4, both systems share mostly the same frequencies ranging from 30 to 500 cm−1, rationalizing similar loss of coherence time, as shown in Table 1.
 Fig. 4  Spectral densities obtained by Fourier transforms of the autocorrelation functions of CBM–VBM bandgap fluctuations for (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 and (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7. The nonradiative electron–hole recombination is primarily driven by low frequency modes. 
The major peak at 100 cm−1 can be assigned to the Pb–I stretching motion and the small peak at around 50 cm−1 can be attributed to the Pb–I–Pb bending motion.85 The modes in the range of 150–200 cm−1 and 300–400 cm−1 are associated with the librational and torsional modes of MA organic cations,86,87 respectively. In particular, the modes near 200–300 cm−1 can be attributed to the coupled motions between the inorganic framework and organic AMP rings. The peaks above 500 cm−1 are likely overtones of the lower frequency vibrations. Therefore, the Pb–I stretching modes and coupled inorganic–organic AMP collective motions contribute to creation of the majority of the NA coupling, leading to the nonradiative electron–hole recombination.
The decoherence time can be obtained as the pure-dephasing time in optical response theory using the second-order cumulant approximation:48. Here, Cij(t) = 〈δEij(t′)δEij(t − t′)〉t′ is the unnormalized autocorrelation function (ACF) of thermal driven bandgap fluctuation δEij between the state i and j. In general, a short decoherence time delays quantum dynamics. The quantum transition stops if the decoherence time is infinitesimal, manifested by the quantum Zeno effect.49,50 The pure-dephasing functions are shown in Fig. 5, and the unnormalized ACFs are presented in the inset. Fitting the data to a Gaussian, exp(−0.5(t/τ)2), provides the pure-dephasing times, τ, shown in Table 1. The pure-dephasing times are similar for (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 and (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7: 3.88 versus 3.98 fs, indicating that the dephasing times have little influence on the difference of electron–hole recombination time scales in the two perovskites reported experimentally.23 Under cumulative approximation, the larger initial value and slower decay of the unnormalized ACF decay favor faster dephasing.88 The inset in Fig. 5 indicates that the initial values of the two unnormalized ACFs are similar, which equal to the squared root of the electronic bandgap fluctuation. At the same time, both unnormalized ACFs decay on similar time scales. Both factors rationalize the similar dephasing times, differing only by 0.1 fs. The ultrashort sub-4 fs dephasing time of the CBM–VBM transitions can be rationalized by the presence of multiple phonon modes in the two systems, as shown in Fig. 4.
 Fig. 5  Pure-dephasing functions for the CBM–VBM transition in the (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 and (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7. The pure-dephasing times are given in Table 1, using Gaussian fitting. The inset shows the unnormalized autocorrelation functions, whose initial values are the bandgap fluctuation squared. The larger initial value and slower decay lead to faster dephasing. 

Fig. 6 gives the evolution of the excited state population in (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 and (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7. In order to directly compare to the experimentally measured time scales, NAMD simulations were performed with experimental bandgaps23 of 2.02 eV for (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 and 2.17 eV for (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 by adding a constant of 0.19 eV to the calculated average bandgap 1.83 and 1.98 eV of MD trajectories for each material. Fitting the data using the short-time linear approximation to the exponential decay, P(t) = exp(−t/τ) ≈ 1 − (t/τ), provides the nonradiative charge decay time, τ, shown in Table 1. The obtained recombination time scales are 286 ps for (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 and 57 ps for (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7, showing excellent agreement with the experimentally measured lifetimes of 280 and sub-100 ps for the two materials,23 respectively. The 50–300 ps lifetimes are significantly shorter than those of 3D perovskites due to the strong quantum confinement effects and weak dielectric screening effects.23,39,89,90 Since the small difference in bandgap, 0.17 eV, and almost similar pure-dephasing times, sub-4 fs, the evident difference between the charge recombination times for the two homologous perovskites arises primarily from the NA coupling rather than the other two factors. The ratio of the decay rate between (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 and (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 is about 5.0 while the corresponding ratio of the two NA couplings is 2.65, providing excellent explanation for the recombination times according to Fermi's golden rule that the transition rate is proportional to the NA coupling squared. The enhanced NA coupling in (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 arises due to stronger hydrogen bonding interactions causing significant distortion of the inorganic octahedron that favours the hybridization between I and Pb atomic orbitals, leading to notable delocalization of the hole charge density by maximizing the overlap with the electron wave function, as shown in Fig. 3. The longer excited-state lifetime rationalizes the high PEC of 3AMP-based solar cells reported experimentally due to slow charge and energy losses,23 suggesting a rational strategy to optimize the photovoltaic and photoelectronic properties of 2D perovskites via molecular engineering.
 Fig. 6  Electron–hole recombination dynamics in (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 and (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7. The difference in electron–hole recombination times is primarily determined by NA coupling, Table 1. 
It is possible that the long-lived excited state lifetime in (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 can arise due to sub-band gap states, polarons, and non-geminated recombination, etc.91–93 For example, trap states are localized and have smaller NA coupling with the VBM than free charge carriers. Thus, the electron–hole recombination time scale should be longer than the computed ones in the presence of self-trapped states. The argument is consistent with the experimental observations on 2D BZA2Pb(BrxI1−x)4 that fast decay is assigned to rapid electron–hole recombination while slow decay is attributed to the trap-mediated recombination using steady-state PL spectroscopy.93 Though the experiment does not explicitly report a sub-band gap state we cannot rule out the presence of it in (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7. Similar to self-trapped states, polarons are generally localized. Proper simulations of polarons require a large simulation cell. Previous ground state DFT calculations on polarons were performed on electron and hole polarons separately.94 In order to study excited state dynamics, both electron and hole polarons should be present in the same simulation cell, increasing further the demand on the simulation cell size. In the present work, we focus on the influence of organic spacers on the non-radiative electron–hole recombination in the two 2D perovskites.
Finally, we computed the radiative lifetimes of (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 and (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 by calculating the Einstein coefficient of spontaneous emission. The computational details are presented in the ESI.† The calculated radiative decay time scales for (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 and (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 are 0.46 ns and 0.17 ns, respectively. They are longer than the nonradiative relaxation time scales, as shown in Table 1, indicating that nonradiative electron–hole recombination constitutes the main process responsible for luminescence decay.
4. Conclusion
Using a combination of NAMD with ab initio real-time TDDFT simulations, we have investigated nonradiative electron–hole recombination in 2D DJ phase AMP-based homologous perovskites, which show great potential for photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications. The simulations rationalized why the 3AMP perovskite shows longer excited-state lifetime compared to the 4AMP perovskite although the two materials have similar decoherence times and the former has even a smaller bandgap. The multiple phonon modes involving both inorganic stretching and coupled inorganic–organic collective motions shorten the decoherence time to sub-4 fs. The bandgap in the 4AMP perovskite is larger than that in the 3AMP perovskite because of stronger antibonding interactions between Pb and I orbitals in the 3AMP perovskite, caused by smaller titling due to weaker hydrogen bonding, which push up the VBM. By delocalizing the VBM charge density in the (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7, the NA coupling is enhanced due to increased electron and hole wave function mixing. As a result, the two-fold increase in the NA coupling for the (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 compared to the (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 accelerates the electron–hole recombination by a factor 5, leading to the excited-state lifetime reducing to 60 ps in the 4AMP perovskite from 280 ps in the 3AMP perovskite. The obtained timescales agree well with the experiment.23 The reported results highlight the importance of charge delocalization in the control of photoexcitation dynamics and provide a strategy to design high performance 2D layered perovskite photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices.

 	Fig. 1  Simulation cells showing the optimized geometries (left panel) and one representative snapshot of the MD trajectory at 300 K (right panel) of (a) (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 and (b) (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7. The schematic diagram (middle panel) characterizes the orientation of 3AMP and 4AMP cations between the two perovskite layers, which highlights the different hydrogen bonds interacting with the iodine atoms of the octahedra. The inorganic Pb–I layers are labelled L1, L2, L3 and L4 in the structures at 300 K.	 

 	Fig. 2  Projected density of states (PDOS) and inorganic Pb–I layer-resolved density of states (LDOS) of (a, c) (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 and (b, d) (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 systems obtained using the optimized geometries. The contributions to the PDOS are split into Pb, I, MA, 3AMP and 4AMP components in the two perovskites. Pb atomic orbitals dominate the CBM while both Pb and I atomic orbitals contribute to the VBM. The LDOS shows that the inorganic Pb–I layers of L1/L3 and L2/L4 contribute to the CBM and VBM in the 3AMP perovskite, respectively. The CBM of the 4AMP perovskite remains on the L1/L3 layer, while the VBM delocalizes on the all inorganic Pb–I layers. L1–L4 are marked in Fig. 1. The dashed lines represent the Fermi level.	 

 	Fig. 3  Charge densities of the VBM and CBM in (a) (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 and (b) (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7. The CBM and VBM of the (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 are supported by the inorganic Pb–I L1/L3 and L2/L4 layers, respectively. This remains true for the CBM in (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 while the VBM delocalizes on all inorganic Pb–I layers. The increased wave function mixing in the (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 enhances NA coupling and accelerates nonradiative electron–hole recombination.

 	Fig. 4  Spectral densities obtained by Fourier transforms of the autocorrelation functions of CBM–VBM bandgap fluctuations for (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 and (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7. The nonradiative electron–hole recombination is primarily driven by low frequency modes.	 

 	Fig. 5  Pure-dephasing functions for the CBM–VBM transition in the (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 and (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7. The pure-dephasing times are given in Table 1, using Gaussian fitting. The inset shows the unnormalized autocorrelation functions, whose initial values are the bandgap fluctuation squared. The larger initial value and slower decay lead to faster dephasing.	 

 	Fig. 6  Electron–hole recombination dynamics in (3AMP)(MA)Pb2I7 and (4AMP)(MA)Pb2I7. The difference in electron–hole recombination times is primarily determined by NA coupling, Table 1.
