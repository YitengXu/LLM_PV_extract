I Introduction
Thermoelectric materials can convert a temperature gradient into electrical energy and vice versa. Compared with traditional generators and refrigerators, thermoelectric devices have several advantages, such as solid-state operation, zero-radiation, their pollution-free nature and long operating lifetime. Although research on thermoelectric materials and devices could date back to the 1950s, there had been only modest progress for 30 years since then. Until the early 1990s, low dimensional structures were predicted to have a much higher figure of merit than bulk materials because of size effects and quantum confinement, which attracted research interest into thermoelectric materials and devices in micro/nanoscale.1 To date, several 1D nanostructures with improved thermoelectric performance, such as superlattices,2 nanowires (NWs),3 nanotubes (NTs)4 and nanocomposites,5 have been reported.
One important parameter to evaluate the performance of thermoelectric materials is a dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit, ZT, which is expressed as: (1)where S is the Seebeck coefficient (μV K−1), σ is electrical conductivity (S cm−1), T is temperature (K), and κ is thermal conductivity (W m−1 K−1). The quantity S2σ is called the power factor (PF) and a large PF means the device can output large voltage and current. The thermal conductivity κ is a summed contribution of carrier transport and lattice vibrations. Thus, κ = κe + κl, where κe is carrier thermal conductivity and κl is lattice thermal conductivity. When the electrical conductivity σ increases, the PF could linearly increase. However, from Wiedemann–Franz law,6 κe = LσT(2)where L is the Lorenz number, the κe also increases. Therefore, it is difficult to increase ZT by increasing the electrical conductivity, σ. From classical kinetic theory, the lattice thermal conductivity, κl, can be expressed as:7 (3)where Cv is the specific heat at constant volume, l is the mean free path of phonons, and νs is the average velocity of sound. When the temperature is much lower than the Debye temperature, the number of excited phonons is small, their mean free path is long, phonon scattering becomes insignificant, and the behavior of κl is dominated by the Debye T3 law. Above the Debye temperature, Cv approaches the classical value of 3R, making κl primarily dependent on l which is determined by phonon–phonon scattering. The Keyes' expression describes the lattice thermal conductivity as:8 (4)where Tm is the melting point, A is the mean atomic weight, γ is the Grüneisen constant, ε is the fractional amplitude of interatomic thermal vibrations, R is the ideal gas constant, N0 is Avogadro's number, and ρ is density. This equation provides some useful hints to decrease κl: (1) κl follows a 1/T law, (2) a low melting point is effective for low κl, (3) increasing atomic mass A can decrease κl, and (4) small density ρ results in low κl. It is found that the lattice thermal conductivity is independent of the electronic structure of materials, which provides a possible approach to achieve high ZT by decreasing κl.
Based on published papers, the available ZT values of the main thermoelectric materials are summarized in Fig. 1. Most thermoelectric devices have ZT of about 1.0 and the energy conversion efficiency is less than 6%.9–12 However, if the ZT is increased to 4, the energy conversion efficiency could reach 30%, which would be a highly attractive prospect for extensive applications. From eqn (1), large ZT requires high S, high σ and low thermal conductivity κ. As proposed by Slack, a material with maximum ZT is referred to as the “phonon glass electron crystal” (PGEC).13 A PGEC material features a glass-like thermal conductivity, coexisting with high mobility charge carriers as a crystal. However, these properties are interdependent on each other in bulk materials and it is hard to individually adjust one parameter. Nanostructured materials could provide opportunities to tailor the electrical conductivity, σ, and thermal conductivity, κ.
 Fig. 1  The figure of merit ZT of some thermoelectric materials as a function of temperature. 
As the dimensions of materials decrease, the state density of electrons changes, thus resulting in transformation of energy bands and different carrier transport. Due to the size of 1D nanostructures being smaller than the mean free path of phonons, boundary scattering is enhanced and thermal conductivity could be reduced. Meanwhile, carrier transport in the 1D direction could be retained or improved, which means that the original or large electrical conductivity could be reached. The Seebeck coefficient of a material also could be increased by small size and quantum confinement effects. According to eqn (1), under a certain temperature, the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT could be improved by reducing the thermal conductivity and increasing the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient. For examples, some nanostructured thermoelectric materials have been observed with ZT values of 1.5–2.5.14–16 The ZT of Si1−xGex NWs, oriented along the [110] direction with a rectangular cross section area of 2.3 nm2, was predicted to be above 4, as shown in Fig. 2(a).17 Theoretical calculations have predicted the ZT of Bi2Te3 with different dimensions in Fig. 2(b).18 Bi2Te3 1D quantum wires with a width of 5 Å and square cross section had a ZT up to 14.19 Therefore, it has been extensively accepted that formation of 1D nanostructures is an effective way to improve the ZT value of a material.

In the following, the most remarkable thermoelectric materials are catalogued into seven kinds, and the fabrication methods of their 1D nanostructures are summarized in detail. Thermoelectric devices based on 1D nanostructures mainly have two kinds of conformation: planar and vertical devices. In order to characterize the thermoelectric figure of merit, ZT, some thermal conductivity measurement methods for 1D nanostructures will also be discussed.
II Thermoelectric materials and fabrication methods
1 Bi–Sb–Te–Se and alloy nanostructures
Doped bulk Bi2Te3 is regarded as one of the best thermoelectric materials.20 The ZT of n-type Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 has reached 1.04 and the ZT of p-type Bi2Te3/Sb2Te3 superlattice could achieve 2.4.14 Theoretical calculations revealed that the ZT of Bi2Te3 NWs could be greater than 10, which has inspired large interest to investigate Bi–Te 1D nanostructures. The thermoelectric properties of Bi NWs and NTs are morphology dependent. A metal–semiconductor transition of Bi NWs occurred when their diameters were reduced to 50 nm or smaller. From theoretical calculations, the thermoelectric performance of Bi NWs was dependent on the diameter and dopant. The ZT of n-type Bi NWs oriented along the trigonal axis with a 5 nm diameter at 77 K could exceed 6.21 In Bi NTs, the metal–semiconductor transition depended on the wall thickness and its ZT was determined by diameter and thickness.22 As shown in Fig. 3, when the diameter and thickness of Bi NTs decreased to 10 nm and 2 nm, the ZT value could increase to 6.23 So both Bi NWs and NTs are promising candidates for thermoelectric research and applications. For BiSbTe alloy, the atomic ratio affected the Seebeck coefficient. The Bi2Sb0.6Te3 NWs, electrodeposited at constant potential of −150 mV, had the highest Seebeck coefficient of −630 μV K−1 at 300 K.24

Due to potential applications in thermoelectric fields, several methods have been developed to fabricate 1D nanostructures of Bi–Te and related alloys, such as template-assisted electrodeposition, hydrothermal methods, on-film formation of NWs (OFF–ON), galvanic displacement and so on. The up to date and representative fabrication approaches will be discussed herein.

1.1 Template-assisted electrodeposition. 
Electrodeposition is a good choice to synthesize nanostructured materials because of its low cost, high deposition rate, large scale and high flexibility to tailor materials’ properties.25 Electrodeposition is carried out in an electrochemical cell, and nanostructures are grown on a target electrode. In order to obtain ordered 1D nanostructures, templates have been usually used in electrodeposition, such as anodic aluminium oxide (AAO) template and porous polymer membranes.24,26,27 The AAO template is commonly used for the reasons (1) it is electrically insulating and reasonably robust, (2) the pore diameters are easily adjusted, (3) the pore density and aspect ratio could be high.28 The size of the pores in the AAO determines the diameter of the NWs. The degree of pore filling is affected by nucleation rate, growth rate and the quality of the AAO template.29
Bi2Te3 NWs have been successfully synthesized using a template-assisted electrodeposition method.28,30–34 The diameter of NWs could be smaller than 40 nm.34 By changing the components in the electrolyte, Bi, Bi/Sb superlattice NWs,35 Sb2Te3,36 Bi2−xSbxTe337 and Bi2Te3−ySey38 NWs could be obtained.
Three electrodeposition techniques: galvanostatic, potentiostatic and pulsed electrodeposition, have been frequently utilized. Pulsed electrodeposition is used more than the other two because of flexible design and accurate control.39 During the pulse time, ions are reduced. In the delay time, ion concentration is recovered. The NWs grown by pulsed electrodeposition have a highly oriented crystalline structure and are grown uniformly on a large scale.31 The Seebeck coefficients of Bi2Te3 NWs, synthesized by pulsed electrodeposition with different atomic ratios of Bi and Te, was from 12 to 33 μV K−1.30 A suitable annealing temperature zone has been found to improve the Seebeck coefficient of Bi2Te3 NWs by pulsed electrodeposition.39
Bi NTs were synthesized by Li and co-workers by pulsed electrodeposition.40 The synthesis process for NTs was similar to that of NWs. The difference was that an Au film was sputtered and only covered the regions around the pore sides. The growth of Bi preferentially occurred on these Au covered areas, resulting in the growth of Bi along the pore wall and forming a tubular nanostructure.
The pulsed electrodeposition technique was used by Xue et al. to prepare Bi/Sb superlattice NWs.35 Two alternative potentials were employed to deposit Bi and Sb segments, respectively. The length of two segments could be controlled by deposition time, deposition potential and ion concentration. The same method was utilized to prepare Bi2Te2Se/Te multilayer NW arrays.41 Xu et al. used an automatically programmed device to move the cathode between four cells cyclically to deposit Bi and Sb segments, respectively, finally synthesizing Bi/Sb superlattice NWs.29


1.2 On-film formation of nanowires method. 
High-quality and high aspect ratio Bi NWs have been synthesized by the on-film formation of NWs (OFF–ON) method, which utilizes stresses in films to induce the growth of NWs. Bi NWs with extraordinary electron mobility (76900 cm2 V−1 s−1) have been fabricated, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 4.42 A Bi polycrystalline thin film was initially deposited onto a thermally oxidized Si (100) substrate. When the substrate was annealed at 350 °C, the different thermal expansion coefficient between the top Bi film (13.4 × 10−6 °C−1) and the SiO2/Si substrate (0.5 × 10−6 °C−1/2.4 × 10−6 °C−1) provided a thermodynamic driving force for Bi NW growth. The length of the Bi NWs depended on the annealing time. The OFF–ON method required that the grains must be pinned with fixed grain boundaries. If the grains could move, hillocks instead of NWs would form. This technology has been successfully extended to synthesize Bi2Te3 NWs and Bi/Te core/shell NWs.43–46 The thermal conductivity of Bi/Te core/shell NWs by the OFF–ON method was reduced to 0.43 W m−1 K−1 with a diameter of 170 nm.46 The decrease was aided by the rough interface of the core/shell, which led to a decrease in the lattice thermal conductivity.

1.3 Hydrothermal synthesis. 
Hydrothermal synthesis is a flexible and economic approach because of the relatively low reaction temperature of about 150 °C in the solution process. All chemicals needed, such as precursors (BiCl3 and tellurium), reductants (e.g. NaBH4) and surfactants, are mixed in a teflon-lined stainless-steel container. The container is sealed immediately and heated to the reaction temperature for the reaction time, following by cooling down to room temperature. During the reaction process, the solution is stirred. After reaction, the samples are filtered, washed and dried in vacuum. The reductants affect the nucleation rate. The surfactants affect the surface-adsorbed energy of special crystal planes and promote the 1D growth of nanostructures.47 Although in most cases nanoparticles are synthesized using hydrothermal methods, it has been reported that Bi2Se3 NTs,48 Bi2Te3 NTs,49 NW50 and nanorods51 could also be prepared by this method. n-Type Bi2Te3 NW synthesized by hydrothermal methods exhibited an enhanced ZT of 0.96 peaking at 380 K.52 Te–Bi2Te3 NW heterostructures were obtained through a hydrothermal approach and possessed a ZT of ∼0.24 at 400 K.53


1.4 Galvanic displacement method. 
The galvanic displacement reaction involves an electrochemical redox process, which depends on the difference in the materials' redox potentials. For example, Ni2+/Ni (E0 = −0.257 V vs. SHE) is more cathodic than Bi3+, HTeO2+/Bi2Te3 (E0 = 0.04[PH] V vs. NHE), then Ni could reduce Bi3+ and HTeO2+ to Bi2Te3 in the mixture. Unlike electrodeposition, galvanic displacement does not need electrodes connected to an external power supply.54 It has been reported that high-aspect ratio Bi2Te3 NTs55 and ultra-long Bi2Te3 nanoribbons54 could be synthesized using the galvanic displacement method. The Seebeck coefficient of the Bi2Te3 nanoribbons synthesized by this method was a little higher than the bulk; however, the power factor was lower because of poor crystallinity.54 Galvanic displacement methods could be carried out in wafer scale, and nanoscale devices could be fabricated with IC-compatible processes. By precisely adjusting the ratio of [Bi3+]/[HTeO2+], the optimum n-type (Bi-doped) and p-type (Te-doped) Bi2Te3 NTs could be obtained.

2 Pb–Te–Se nanostructures
PbTe is another kind of promising thermoelectric material because of its narrow band gap (0.31 eV at 300 K), face centered cubic (rock salt) structure and large average excitonic Bohr radius (about 46 nm) allowing for strong quantum confinement within a large range of size. The ZT value 1.6 has been observed in PbSeTe/PbTe quantum dot superlattices.15 PbTe 1D nanostructures have been synthesized by hydrothermal,56 vapor liquid solid (VLS),57 electrodeposition58 and lithographically patterned NW electrodeposition (LPNE)59–61 methods. The LPNE method will be discussed in detail in the following section.

2.1 Lithographically patterned nanowire electrodeposition. 
Lithographically patterned NW electrodeposition (LPNE), combining photolithography, top-down etching and bottom-up electrodeposition, is schematically illustrated in Fig. 5.62 It has been successfully used to synthesize gold NWs,62 PbTe NWs and conductive polymer NWs.63 A nickel layer was normally deposited onto glass or other nonconductive surfaces as a sacrificial electrode. Photolithography and etching were performed to produce a horizontal trench along the perimeter of the exposed region. The remaining nickel under the photoresist acted as electrodeposition electrodes. Cyclic electrodeposition-stripping technology was employed to deposit metals or PbTe NW arrays. Finally, the photoresist and remaining nickel were removed by acetone and nitric acid, respectively. In order to form air-suspended PbTe NWs, LPNE could be extended to photoresist-bottomed LPNE (PB-LPNE).60 The difference was that a photoresist layer was initially spin-coated onto glass or other nonconductive surfaces before the nickel layer was evaporated. The following steps were similar to LPNE. The bottom photoresist was patterned, and the air-suspended PbTe NWs formed. The PbTe NWs produced by the LPNE method were polycrystalline.61 The Seebeck coefficient of the as-prepared PbTe NWs with LPNE was −41 μV K−1, and −479 μV K−1, obtained after annealing at 453 K, which was higher than the S (−260 μV K−1) of bulk PbTe.61

3 Si one-dimensional nanostructures
Recently, rough silicon NWs (SiNWs) were found to be promising thermoelectric materials due to their low thermal conductivity and high ZT of 0.6 at room temperature.3 This discovery prompted scientists to research Si nanostructures as kinds of effective thermoelectric components. Si as a thermoelectric material has many advantages. Firstly, Si is abundant and environmentally friendly. Secondly, the current microelectronics industry based on silicon has been highly developed, resulting in a large reduction of fabrication costs for thermoelectric devices. Theoretical calculations have predicted that the biggest ZT of SiNWs could be over 5.64 SiNWs with the [110] direction exhibited the worst performance compared to [111] and [100] NWs using the sp3d5s* tight-binding model coupled with a ballistic transport approach. As the cross-section area of NWs decreased, the thermoelectric properties of SiNWs could be enhanced. The triangular NWs with a side length of 1 nm had the best results for ZT and values of 1.5 and 0.85 could be achieved for an n-type [111] NW and a p-type [100] NW, respectively.65 In order to improve the thermoelectric properties of 1D Si nanostructures, decreasing the thermal conductivity was an effective approach. The thermal conductivity of SiNWs could be decreased more than one order according to theoretical predictions.66 Direct molecular dynamics simulations revealed that thermal conductivity could be considerably reduced in SiNW surfaces terminated with {111}/{100} facets.67 Comparing NWs, Si NTs possessed low thermal conductivity.68 Dry etching of SOI has fabricated holey Si, as shown in Fig. 6. The thermal conductivity of the holey Si was close to amorphous SiO2 at 2 W m−1 K−1 and the ZT value could be 0.4 at room temperature.69 Several approaches have been developed to synthesize SiNWs. The frequently used methods for SiNW fabrication involve two mechanisms: VLS growth (bottom-up) and metal-assisted electroless etching (up–down).

3.1 Vapor liquid solid growth. 
The VLS growth mechanism has been widely used to synthesize 1D nanostructures. The process is described with the synthesis of SiNWs as an example. Metal catalyst nanoparticles, such as Au,70 were firstly precipitated onto the substrate to act as seeds for VLS growth. The NW growth was carried out in a chemical vapor deposition system, which was usually heated to a temperature over the eutectic point of Au–Si. The carrier gas (i.e. diluted H2 in Ar) brought the precursor (i.e. SiCl4) into the reaction tube. The precursor gas only decomposed on the surfaces of the catalyst nanoparticles. The freshly generated Si was dissolved in Au to form an alloy. When the concentration of Si in Au nanoparticles reached saturation, nucleation and growth occurred at the interface between the catalyst droplet and substrate. So for the whole growth, Si existed in the precursor as vapour, in the alloy as liquid and in the NW as solid. The size of the formed alloy droplet defined the diameters of the NWs, and the reaction time determined the length of the NWs. In order to obtain ordered aligned SiNW arrays, an AAO template has been used to manipulate the dispersion of metal particles.71 Generally, the surfaces of SiNWs synthesized by VLS were smooth. However, Park and co-workers synthesized rough SiNWs using Mn as catalyst. The thermal conductivity of rough surface SiNWs with a diameter of 177 nm was decreased to ∼22 W m−1 K−1 from ∼150 W m−1 K−1 for bulk Si.72 The VLS method could also be used to synthesize other 1D nanostructures, such as Bi2Te3 nanobelts,73 InSb NWs,74,75 Si0.96Ge0.04 NWs76 and so on. The electrical conductivity was normally improved because of good crystallinity, but thermal conductivity was hard to decrease at the same time.


3.2 Electroless etching method. 
Wafer-scale SiNWs can be fabricated using the metal-assisted electroless etching (EE) method.77–80 In the Ag/Si/HF/Fe(NO3)3 system, noble metal ions (i.e. Ag+) capture electrons from the Si substrate to form Ag deposited on the surface of the silicon. The Fe3+ ions obtain electrons from Ag nanoparticles to be reduced to Fe2+ ions. The Si beneath the Ag nuclei loses electrons and is oxidized followed by being etched in HF solution. The metal nanoparticles catalyze the etching of Si. The regions covered by noble metal nanoparticles are etched and the rest of the regions remain to form SiNWs. In order to gain ordered SiNW arrays, AAO templates71 and re-patterning techniques, such as colloidal lithography81,82 and laser interference lithography,83 have been combined with the EE method. In general, compared with the SiNWs prepared by VLS, the SiNWs prepared by the EE method were rough and have low thermal conductivity.3

4 III–V semiconductor nanowires
Mingo theoretically calculated the thermoelectric figure of merit and maximum power factor of III–V semiconductor NWs, such as InSb, InAs, GaAs and InP.84 The calculation results predicted that only InSb NWs seemed to be a promising candidate. To date, InSb NWs have been grown using the VLS method and their thermoelectric properties have been characterized.74,75,85,86 Zhou et al. investigated the effect of growth base pressure on the thermoelectric properties of InSb NWs.86 They found that the ZT values of InSb NWs were about 10 times lower than the reported bulk values because of a reduced Seebeck coefficient and mobility, and in order to obtain high ZT, impurity doping and the surface of NWs should be well controlled.75,86 The other theoretical calculations for InN NWs showed that the ZT could reach around 1.6 at 1000 K and 0.256 at room temperature, which indicated that the InN NWs could be a potential candidate for thermoelectric applications.87
5 Si/Ge and SiC
Bulk SiGe alloy is a good thermoelectric material for high temperature applications. Many theoretical calculation results predicted that SiGe NWs,88 Si/Ge superlattice NWs89,90 and core/shell91,92 NWs had high ZTs because of suppressed thermal conductivity induced by strong interface scattering, carrier-phonon scattering and alloy scattering.76,93 ZT of Si/Ge superlattice NWs of 1.7 nm diameter could be higher than 1 at 300 K based on ab initio electronic structure calculations and Boltzmann transport theory.89 Compared with Si/Ge superlattice and core/shell NWs, SiGe alloy NWs were relatively easily synthesized by the VLS method.76,94 ZT values of SiGe alloy NWs reached 0.46 at 450 K by experimental measurements and could reach 2.2 at 800 K by computation.94 The maximum ZT of SiGe quantum wires could be above 4 by theoretical simulation.17 The ZT value of Ge/Si core–shell NWs with p-type doping could reach 0.85 at 300 K by using ab initio electronic structure calculations.95 ZT at 300 K for thin (<2 nm diameter), p-type [111] H-passivated axially heterostructured Si/Ge NWs could reach 3 with first-principles density-functional theory simulations.91 In general, there were two approaches to synthesize Si/Ge superlattice NWs. The first one was to grow Si and Ge segments respectively using the VLS method.96,97 The second one involved layer-by-layer Si/Ge film by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), then superlattice NWs were fabricated by metal-assisted chemical etching.96,98
Single-crystalline β-SiC NWs from a CVD furnace had a diameter of 60–100 nm and were a few tens of micrometers long. The thermal conductivity of the β-SiC NWs was obtained to be 86.5 ± 3.5 W m−1 K−1. The Seebeck coefficient was obtained to be −1.21 mV K−1. Thus, the dimensionless figure of merit ZT was measured to be 0.12. This value is around 120 times higher than the reported maximum value of bulk β-SiC.99
6 Oxide nanostructures
Thermoelectric oxide materials such as NaCo2O4, La0.95Sr0.05CoO3, Ca3Co4O9 and Bi2Sr2Co2Ox were promising for thermoelectric applications.100–103 They had complex crystalline structures, in which CoO2 layers could serve as electronic transport layers, while sodium ion, calcium ion, or strontium ion layers could serve as phonon scattering layers.100 In other words, the materials had separated phonon-glass areas and electron-crystal areas.101 By controlling the transportation of electrons and phonons separately, it was possible to enhance their thermoelectric figure of merit. Single crystal (Ca2CoO3)0.7CoO2 was reported to have a ZT value of about 0.87 at 973 K.104 Single crystal Bi2Sr2Co2Ox whiskers were reported to have a ZT value over 1.1 at 973 K.103 These oxide materials could be synthesized by a sol–gel method with an AAO membrane as the supporting template105 and a sol–gel based electrospinning method.100,101
The thermoelectric properties of Zn and ZnO NWs have also been investigated. From theoretical calculations, when the diameter of ZnO NWs decreased to 8 Å, ZT increased 30 times compared with the bulk.106 The thermoelectric power of 4 nm diameter Zn NWs embedded in porous host materials was −130 μV K−1 and that of ZnO NWs was as high as −400 μV K−1.107,108 4 nm diameter Zn NWs have been synthesized by a vapor-phase technique. Porous Vycor glass with pore sizes on the order of 4 nm acted as the host material and was put on top of a crucible in a vacuum chamber. Firstly, the host material was heated to about 640 °C for outgassing. Subsequently, the crucible was heated to 480 °C to get Zn vapor across the porous Vycor glass. Then the crucible was cooled to allow Zn vapor to condense inside the host material.107 The ZnO NWs could also be synthesized by VLS and metal organic vapour phase epitaxy (MOVPE) methods.109–111 The surface passivation of ZnO NWs would have a negative impact on the thermoelectric performance.112 Polytypoid M2O3(ZnO)n NWs, where M was In, Ga, Fe, and other trivalent metals, ZnO NWs doped with M oxide, exhibited enhanced thermopower and thermal resistivity.113 The polytypoid M2O3(ZnO)n NWs could also be synthesized by the VLS method.114 Two terminal I–V measurements on individual suspended ZnO NWs in vacuum found that the thermal conductivity of ZnO NWs was much smaller than that of the bulk and ZT approached 0.11 at around 1000 K.115 Study of the thermoelectric property of ZnO ceramics has been motivated by the reports of the improved electrical conductivity and reduced thermal conductivity by employing elements (Al, Ga, Mn) as dopants. In Al and Ga dually doped ZnO ceramics, ZT was about twice that of pure ZnO, which could arrive at 0.65 at 1247 K.116
7 Carbon nanotubes and graphene
Thermoelectric properties of CNTs and CNT/polymer nanocomposites have been studied.117–121 The thermoelectric power of single walled CNTs was sensitive to gas exposure122–125 and could be strongly modulated by gate electric field.126 Single walled CNTs could be synthesized by CVD, arc vaporization methods and pulsed laser ablation methods.127–129 Composites containing polymers and CNTs were regarded as promising thermoelectric materials with large thermoelectric power factors (S2σ)119,130,131 and low-cost.
The thermoelectric performance of graphene has also attracted extensive research interest. Theoretical calculations indicated that it was possible to realize an electron-crystal coexisting with a phonon-glass in zigzag graphene nanoribbons.132 When periodic vacancies were added into graphene, a ZT of 0.4 at room temperature could be obtained.133 It was found that the maximum ZT was proportional to the number of defects in the longitudinal direction, but inversely proportional to that in the transverse direction in graphene.134 If extended line defects were introduced into zigzag graphene nanoribbon with a 4 nm width and a 2 μm length, a maximum ZT of 4 could be achieved.135 Graphene nanoribbons could be prepared by many approaches, such as lithographic patterning after mechanical cleavage of graphite, chemical synthesis, CVD growth and decomposition of SiC wafers.136–140
III Thermoelectric device fabrication and characterization methods
The working principle of a thermoelectric device is simple. The device should include a temperature difference for thermoelectric materials and a circuit for current. For generator application, when a temperature gradient across a thermoelectric material is built, voltage would be generated from the thermoelectric materials.141 For cooling applications, if current flows through the thermoelectric material, cold and hot ends would form. Compared with bulk thermoelectric devices, fabrication of devices based on 1D nanostructures is complicated. Manipulation and localization of nanostructures, circuit formation and heat conduction design are all difficult at the nanoscale. In general, thermoelectric devices based on 1D nanostructures could be classified into two types depending on configuration: planar and vertical devices.
1 Planar device
One kind of planar device has been extensively utilized to measure Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity of individual 1D nanostructure, and the typical configuration is shown in Fig. 7.74 Generally, a non-heat conductive substrate was used and nanostructures were dispersed on it. Then electron-beam lithography (EBL) and lift-off were performed to fabricate metal electrodes. The topmost metal line acted as a heater line to provide a temperature gradient across the 1D nanostructure. A thermovoltage (ΔV) generated by the 1D nanostructures could be observed between the two outer electrodes. The contact electrode near the heater line also served as a resistance thermometer line to measure the temperature change (ΔT), suggesting that the temperature change far away from the heater was negligible. The Seebeck coefficient could be calculated using the formula, S = ΔV/ΔT.

In order to calculate ZT, thermal conductivity should be obtained. A complex structure has been developed to simultaneously measure S, σ and κ of a single nanostructure in one device. The representative structure is shown in Fig. 8.120 The suspended structure is used in vacuum and guarantees that heat only flowed through the 1D nanostructure, and then the thermal conductivity of the nanostructure could be obtained. Fabrication processes and measurement operations have been discussed in detail in the literature.142 1D nanostructures are put on the gap between two suspended membranes by dispersing at random or localizing with micromanipulators. Then a focused ion beam (FIB) is frequently used to weld two ends of the nanostructure for electrical contact. The operation method is similar to the device introduced above. The platinum resistance thermometer (PRT) coils on the suspended membranes act not only as a heater but also as a thermometer. A dc current flows through one PRT coil to yield a temperature gradient across the 1D nanostructure. The voltage induced by the temperature gradient is measured using contacting electrodes. Seebeck coefficient, electric conductivity and thermal conductivity could be calculated depending on the measurement results.

A thermoelectric device based on a single 1D nanostructure could only generate a very small voltage. Therefore, it is necessary to assemble several 1D nanostructures to get large output power. A planar thermoelectric microgenerator based on SiNWs has been successfully fabricated using typical microfabrication processes.143,144 This device consisted of two silicon masses, with SiNWs grown in the gap between the two masses as the thermoelectric materials, schematically shown in Fig. 9(a). The central suspended silicon mass, on which heater strips were set, served as the high temperature zone. The surrounding one acted as the low temperature zone. The SiNWs between the two masses were grown using a VLS mechanism. The Seebeck coefficient of the device was 1500 μV K−1. Another example is shown in Fig. 9(b). By conventional complementary metal oxide semiconductors (CMOS) technology, the thermoelectric module containing n- and p-legs was fabricated from a silicon on insulator (SOI) wafer. The fabricated micro-thermoelectric device consisted of three parts: a heat source, heat sink and SiNWs. The highest power factor of n-type SiNWs was 2.77 mW m−1 K−2, which was about 4.2 times larger than the highest one for p-type. The total Seebeck coefficient and power factor of the unit device were 157.66 μV K−1 and 9.30 mW m−1 K−2 at 300 K, respectively.145

2 Vertical device
Compared with a planar device, a vertical device could include more 1D nanostructures and could be integrated into other devices or circuits easily. A high-performance vertical thermoelectric device should consist of several hundred of pairs of p- and n-type thermoelectric elements assembled thermally in parallel and electrically in series. For NW-based thermoelectric devices, bottom-up and top-down approaches have been used.

2.1 Bottom-up fabrication. 
Thermoelectric microgenerators based on Bi2Te3 NWs has been fabricated using template and electrochemical deposition (ECD) methods.25,146–150 The template not only controls the growth of the NWs but also isolates these NWs. A schematic of the processing flow is shown in Fig. 10.146 Au film was sputtered onto the bottom side of an AAO template to act as the electrode layer on which NWs were grown electrochemically. A photoresist was spin coated onto the top surface of AAO and patterned to expose the n-type zone. After pores in the n-type zone were opened using NaOH solution, the template was immersed in ECD solution and n-type Bi2Te3 NWs were deposited. After removing the remaining photoresist, the same photoresist was again spin coated onto the top surface of the template and patterned to expose the p-type zone. The same method was used to fabricate a p-type NW array. Then the bottom Au layer was selectively etched to form a conductive connection of the p-type and n-type zone. On the top side, the Au layer was sputtered and etched to connect the patterned n-type and p-type zone in series. Moreover, a SiNW-based thermoelectric device with similar structure has been prepared using the VLS growth method, but the performance should be improved further.151

2.2 Top-down fabrication. 
The traditional top-down CMOS technology has been used to fabricate a thermoelectric microgenerator based on SiNWs.152 The fabrication process is schematically shown in Fig. 11. SiNWs were fabricated using deep UV lithography and dry etching of silicon. Zones of p- and n-type were defined by separate lithography and ion implantation. The silicon between the pairs was etched away to isolate these thermocouples. While protecting the SiNW sidewall with the dielectrics, the bottom conductive connection was formed by a selective silicidation process using nickel. Then the gaps between the NWs were filled using a low-temperature oxide, followed by top conductive connection using TaN/Al. Finally, Si3N4 was deposited over the top surface to insulate the device. The thermoelectric generator had an open-circuit voltage of 1.5 mV, a short-circuit current of 3.79 μA and a maximum output power of 1.5 nW.

3 Characterization of thermal conductivity of one-dimensional nanostructure
The thermal conductivity of a 1D nanostructured material could be decreased in some range by many approaches, such as cutting down size, coarsening the surface/interface, doping and so on.153 In order to accurately measure the thermal conductivity of 1D nanostructures, any thermal bypass should be avoided. All measurements are performed in vacuum to remove the heat transport of air. Utilizing thick SiO2 and gap as a heat insulator, a facile device structure has been used to measure the thermal conductivity of single NWs, schematically shown in Fig. 12(a).154 The heater and sensing parts could be totally suspended by microfabrication technology, as shown in Fig. 8.120 The microfabricated device, usually used to measure the thermal conductivity of 1D nanostructures, has been discussed in detail in the section “Planar device”. This device structure has been extensively used for the characterization of the thermal conductivity of 1D nanostructures, such as B nanobelts and BC NWs.155,156 Generally, after the formation of a suspended structure and electrodes, a 1D nanostructure is put on the gap with a micromanipulator and welded to form electrical connections at two ends with FIB, as shown in Fig. 12(b).99

In the previous temperature measurement configuration, both the heating and sensing resistances were measured by a standard four-point probe I–V method using a small ac current and lock-in amplifier. The method had a sensitivity of ∼1 nW K−1. As shown in Fig. 13, the improved measurement sensitivity was built upon a Wheatstone bridge circuit by employing an on-chip pair resistance for highly sensitive temperature and conductance measurements with ∼1 mK and ∼10 pW K−1 sensitivities, respectively.157

The thermoreflectance imaging technique could provide in situ high-resolution images, which was based on the temperature dependence of the materials' reflection coefficient. In other words, the temperature change would result in a reflected light intensity change. Due to such a small signal, a lock-in amplifier would be used to detect the signal for imaging.143 The thermoreflectance measurement setup was a reliable noncontact temperature measurement technique and a lateral resolution of 0.5 μm and temperature resolution of 0.1 °C could be achieved.158
In scanning thermal microscopy (SThM) techniques, the thermal exchange radius between the tip and sample was a crucial parameter, which limited the lateral spatial resolution. The 3ω-SThM method has been used for precise identification of the thermal exchange radius.159 Based on the temperature dependent Raman spectrum, a facile, rapid, and nondestructive technique for determining the thermal conductivity of individual NWs has been demonstrated.160
IV Perspectives and conclusions
There exists a huge amount of heat on earth which is not effectively used. Thermoelectric materials may provide a chance to improve the usage efficiency of thermal energy. For practical application of thermoelectric materials, further increasing of the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT is still the main goal. Through reading papers, analysis and writing of this manuscript, to our knowledge, the following three topics in the thermoelectric field might be more and more active in the near future. The first involves utilizing external electrical or magnetic fields to modify carrier and phonon transportation.161–165 Theoretical simulation showed that external electric fields could affect electron scattering strength. At the optimum electron scattering, the thermoelectric power factor could be enhanced by 6–18%.166 Another theoretical study revealed that the external perpendicular electric field could increase the Seebeck coefficient of the bismuth telluride NWs by a factor of 2 and the enhanced ZT could reach a value as high as 3.4 at room temperature.162 In order to investigate the effect of electric fields on nanostructures experimentally, the electric field is usually added to the device as a gate. The thermoelectric performances of Sb2Te3,163 Si164 and Bi165 NWs under a gate voltage have been studied. The gate voltage could modify the carrier density in a wide range, resulting in an enhanced thermoelectric power factor.164 For some ferromagnetic nanostructures, their magnetization under an external magnetic field has a significant influence on their thermoelectric performance.161
The second topic is to increase ZT by modulating the geometry of 1D nanostructures. Special geometric shapes can improve phonon scattering and reduce thermal conductivity. Many complex geometric shapes have been investigated, such as intentionally rough surface,167,168 heterostructures,169 modulated diameters,170–172 double-bend NWs,173 and helical nano-configuration.174 Double-bend NWs displayed large Seebeck coefficients due to quantum interference effects.173 A helical geometric configuration was interesting and attractive for reducing thermal conductivity.174
The third topic is to develop special kinds of thermoelectric materials for specific applications. For use in a high temperature surrounding, stable oxide compounds and boron carbide are suitable.175–178 La0.95Sr0.05CoO3 nanofibers obtained by an electrospinning process had a Seebeck coefficient of 650 μV K−1, which was higher than that of thin films and bulk form.175 The Seebeck coefficient of titanate NTs Na2−xHxTi3O7 increased sharply from 745 K to 1032 K, reaching 302 μV K−1.177 This indicates that titanate NTs are promising thermoelectric materials for high temperature applications. Theoretical simulations predicted that Kondo insulator NWs possessed a large thermoelectric figure of merit at low temperatures and were suitable for high performance thermoelectric cooling devices. When its diameter was between 20 and 500 nm, the ZT could be above 1.179 Flexible thermoelectric devices are attractive because they can be used with any kind of objects with any shape. A kind of flexible thermoelectric material, PbTe nanocrystal-coated glass fibers, has been reported recently. Its ZT can reach 0.73 at 400 K.180 Nanostructures based on conductive polymers or organic–inorganic hybrids have also been widely studied because of their flexibility, low cost and ease of control.130,131,181–185 β-Naphthalene sulfonic acid doped polyaniline NTs have been reported. All of the three thermoelectric parameters, including Seebeck coefficient, electrical and thermal conductivity, were improved. The ZT was enhanced by two orders of magnitude.181
The improved thermoelectric properties of 1D nanostructures have attracted increasing interest, which were improved due to a decrease in thermal conductivity, and increase in electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient. Seven kinds of the most popular thermoelectric materials with 1D nanostructures have been reviewed. Strategies for synthesizing 1D nanostructures and arrays have been discussed in detail. Thermoelectric devices, based on 1D nanostructures with different configurations, and the corresponding fabricating processes have been summarized. Thermometry methods and the related devices for measuring the thermal conductivity of 1D nanostructures have been presented. Finally, three potentially hot topics in the thermoelectric field in the near future were proposed and discussed based on a large number of papers.
