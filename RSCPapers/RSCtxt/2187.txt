    , Accepted 22nd August 2022First published on 23rd August 2022AbstractThe photocatalytic performance of polymeric carbon nitride (C3N4) is heavily restricted by insufficient n → π* electronic transitions and limited active sites. To this end, we adopted an integrated copolymerization and repyrolysis approach to fabricate two-dimensional thiophene ring implanted (C3N4) nanosheets (2D Thing-CNNS). Advanced characterization studies demonstrated that the fusion of thiophene rings and the formation of 2D nanosheets significantly collectively elevated the n → π* electronic transitions and enlarged the specific surface areas of 2D Thing-CNNS, leading to a dramatically extended π-conjugated system and accelerated charge migration. Transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and solid-state 13C NMR proved the existence of the thiophene ring. Additionally, quantum computations of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied crystal orbitals implied that the 2D Thing-CNNS are more favorable for carrier migration than pristine (C3N4). The finite element method (FEM) analysis indicates that 2D Thing-CNNS have a stronger surface electric field and radiation absorption, which is consistent with the enhanced n → π* transition. Consequently, 2D Thing-CNNS exhibit a 42.7-fold enhancement in photocatalytic performances for bisphenol A oxidation accordingly, compared with pristine C3N4. This work provides a novel strategy for engineering the electronic structure of C3N4 for highly efficient water purification.
Introduction
With the ever-increasing energy demand and the excessive depletion of fossil fuels, serious environmental pollution issues have aroused worldwide concerns.1–5 Admittedly, it is urgent to develop green and advanced materials and technologies to address these issues. To this end, semiconductor-mediated photocatalysis emerges as a prospective technique owing to its sustainability and high performance in photocatalytic hydrogen production,6 water splitting,7 pollutant decontamination,8,9 and carbon dioxide reduction.10 The key to this technique is to develop novel semiconducting materials with favorable absorption structures, high redox activity, and robustness upon solar light irradiation.
Among all the investigated photocatalysts, conjugated polymeric carbon nitride (C3N4), as a metal-free and inexpensive photocatalyst, has sparked interdisciplinary attention by virtue of its excellent characteristics, including simple manufacture from inexpensive precursors, an appropriate visible-light wavelength (ca. 460 nm), a suitable band gap (2.7 eV), nontoxicity, and high physicochemical stability.11–14 In addition to this, as a conjugated polymer, C3N4 is composed of triazine and heptazine structural units with sp2 hybridized carbon and nitrogen atoms. Therefore, it has a π-conjugated supermolecular network that allows for flexible regulation of properties by tailoring the molecular structure. However, pristine C3N4 exhibits unsatisfactory photocatalytic activities because of inherent obstacles, such as severe exciton recombination, inefficient optical absorption response, and lower specific surface areas (SSAs).15–17 Thereupon, to achieve sufficient solar energy conversion efficiency, it is necessary to regulate the structural and electronic properties of C3N4.
To date, a variety of strategies, such as doping with heteroatoms,18 copolymerization with conjugated monomers,19 grafting functional groups,20 and intensifying crystallinity,21 have been affirmed to overcome these imperfections and to maximize the potential of conjugated C3N4 carbon-based materials as metal-free and sustainable solar photocatalysts. Recent progress reveals that the n → π* electronic transitions induced by the lone-pair electrons at the edge N atom of the triazine/heptazine ring can expand the delocalization of π electrons, which can effectively broaden the visible-light-response wavelength of C3N4 materials to 600 nm.22,23 The n → π* electronic transition refers to the electronic transition from the independent electron pair to the excited state of the π electron system. Unfortunately, the highly condensed C3N4 is composed of planar and symmetric heptazine-based structural units, and the electronic transition is dominated by π → π* transitions. Thus, to trigger n → π* electron transitions, the tri-s-triazine units need to be distorted, and the symmetry and planar structure of C3N4 should be destroyed.24 Various synthetic strategies have been developed to activate n → π* electronic transitions. For instance, Zhang25et al. synthesized crystalline poly-heptazine-imide (PHI) C3N4via a one-pot polymerization of 5-amino tetrazole in a eutectic salt mixture. The derived polymer exhibited enhanced n → π* electron transitions, leading to significantly enhanced light absorption and photocatalytic evolution of H2. In another study, Zhang and co-workers26 successfully reported the self-assembly of C3N4 nanotubes via copolymerization of oxamide (OA) and urea. The OA-modified polymers displayed enhanced visible light absorption (above 450 nm), where the absorption bands located at approximately 520 nm are assigned to the n → π* electron transitions. The optimized copolymers facilitated charge carriers and enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution. The above-mentioned studies suggested that the incorporation of conjugated π-deficient electron monomers is favorable for the enhancement of n → π* electronic transitions.
Apart from conjugated π-deficient electron monomers, thiophene-based π-conjugated and electron-rich molecules have attracted unprecedented interest owing to their outstanding electrical and optical features, and most importantly high stability. For instance, Ge27et al. designed aromatic electron-rich thiophene group-grafted C3N4via co-polymerization of urea and 3-thiophenemalonic acid. The synthesized photocatalysts exhibited dramatically facilitated charge separation and improved optical absorption than C3N4 because of enabling n → π* electron transitions by the presence of S atoms in the tri-s-triazine structure. However, the selected thiophene derivatives contain electron-withdrawing carboxyl groups, which make the thiophene ring unable to achieve high electron density and have insufficient power for n → π* electron transitions, resulting in the photocatalytic performance remaining unsatisfactory and requiring further intensification of the n → π* transitions. Therefore, it is theoretically more advantageous to develop a thiophene ring with electron-donating groups to increase the electron density. Besides, a recent study suggested that n → π* electronic transitions can be regulated by the controlled pyrolysis approach. For example, An24et al. synthesized a self-supporting 3D polymeric carbon nitride (SSD) with tunable n → π* transitions by a facile stepwise pyrolysis strategy. The as-prepared SSD possesses curved layers, with plenty of wrinkles and an enlarged size. Besides, the optimized SSD structure significantly enhanced the crystallinity and structural integrity, improved charge mobility, extended the π-conjugated aromatic system, and distorted the heptazine-based skeleton. In addition, the re-pyrolysis of C3N4 under an inert atmosphere can exfoliate carbon nitride into C3N4 nanosheets, which can dramatically increase SSA to facilitate light absorption, provide abundant active sites, and shorten the exciton transport distance, thus reducing the recombination of photoinduced carriers.28,29 Therefore, it is anticipated that the combination of implanting small molecules and controlled pyrolysis will dually reinforce the electronic n → π* transition effect. To the best of our knowledge, such an integrated protocol has not been reported yet.
Herein, an integrated copolymerization and high-temperature re-pyrolysis strategy was developed to synthesize a thiophene ring with electron-donating amino groups grafted on two-dimensional C3N4 nanosheets (2D Thing-CNNS). The fusion of the thiophene ring and re-pyrolysis can distort the structure to induce more n → π* electron transitions and increase the SSA of C3N4. The engineered 2D Thing-CNNS were highly active for photocatalytic degradation bisphenol A (BPA). Advanced characterization together with density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that superior performance stemmed from the ameliorated electronic structure and optical properties induced by the n → π* excitations.
Experimental section
Synthesis of C3N4 and implanted thiophene ring carbon nitride
The thiophene ring implanted carbon nitride (Thing-CN) was obtained via a copolymerization approach. In detail, different amounts of 2-aminothiophene-3-carbonitrile (ATCN) and urea (10 g) were dissolved in 10 mL H2O, and then, the mixed solution was stirred at 80 °C to evaporate H2O. After that, the resultant solid was calcined at 550 °C for 2 h in air. The prepared samples were labeled as X-Thing-CN, where X (0.05%, 0.10%, 0.30%, and 1.00%) represents the weight ratio of ATCN to urea. Bulk C3N4 was also synthesized by directly calcining 10 g urea by the same experimental procedure.
Synthesis of two-dimensional carbon nitride nanosheets and two-dimensional implanted thiophene ring carbon nitride nanosheets
Two-dimensional implanted thiophene ring carbon nitride nanosheets (2D Thing-CNNS) were fabricated by a high-temperature re-pyrolysis approach. The 0.10%-Thing-CN was wrapped entirely with tin foil and then calcined at 620 °C under a continuous flow of nitrogen for 2 h, forming 2D Thing-CNNS. Two-dimensional carbon nitride nanosheets (2D CNNS) are prepared by heating C3N4 according to the same method. The synthesis schematic diagram of 2D Thing-CNNS is demonstrated in Fig. 1a.

Evaluation of photocatalytic activity
The oxidation activity was assessed by the photocatalytic degradation of bisphenol A (BPA) pollutants. The catalysts (25 mg) were dispersed in 50 mL of BPA solution (10 mg L−1). A 300 W simulated solar Xe lamp was selected as the visible light source. Before the lamp was turned on, the suspension was mechanically stirred in the dark for 1 h to reach an adsorption equilibrium state of the pollutant. After turning on the light, samples were taken every 10 min and then transferred into a brown sample bottle. The concentration of BPA is detected using an HPLC C18 chromatographic column and a UV detector (SPD-20A, Japan); the mobile phase volume ratio is methanol:water (60:40) with a flow rate of 0.5 mL min−1; the temperature is 30 °C. The stability test was performed in four cycles. After each cycle, ethanol and water were alternately washed three time and dried at 60 °C for 12 h, then the lost catalyst was replenished to 25 mg in the next experiment.
Computational studies
Computational studies, including density functional theory (DFT) calculations and finite element method (FEM) calculations were carried out to obtain mechanistic insight into the enhanced catalytic performance. In DFT calculations, the CASTEP package was used to evaluate the work function, the highest occupied crystal orbital (HOCO), the lowest unoccupied crystal orbital (LUCO), and the permittivity of C3N4 and the 2D Thing-CNNS. The plane wave basis group was used, together with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional.30 The unit cell model proposed was used for pristine C3N4.31 The critical energy was defined as 430 eV, and a 3 × 3 × 4 k-point Brillouin zone was sampled. Further modelling details were provided in our previous studies.32
COMSOL Multiphysics software was used in the FEM simulation to evaluate the impact of crystal structural change on photocatalytic performance. The layered structures of C3N4 and the 2D Thing-CNNS, situated at the lower portion of a domain that was filled with a reagent, were derived from the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. The radiation source is located at the top of the domain, and the monochromatic light with different wavelengths is transmitted downwards vertically with an intensity of 104 W m−2. The physical parameters of C3N4 and 2D Thing-CNNS were adapted from a previous report33 and our DFT results, respectively. Further details could be found in the previous reports.34
Results and discussion
The polymerization working mechanism of ATCN on urea
Thiophene is an electron-rich group, and the two amino groups on ATCN are strong electron-donating groups. Therefore, ATCN is a strong electron-donating organic molecule with nucleophilicity. According to the reported mechanism of urea molecular copolymerization of C3N4, a possible polymerization mechanism was proposed. First, the carbon center in the urea molecule was nucleophilically attacked by amino groups in ATCN to form a diurea intermediate with a thiophene ring.35,36 It was then cyclized to cyanuric acid with Thing during pyrolysis and reacts with ammonia gas produced during pyrolysis to form cyanuramide and melamine with Thing, ultimately leading to the formation of X-Thing-CN (Fig. S1†). Table S1† presents the yield of the prepared samples; the final yields of C3N4, 2D CNNS, 0.10%-Thing-CN, and 2D Thing-CNNS were 3.51%, 4.13%, 2.50%, and 3.05%, respectively. It could be observed that the yields of 0.10%-Thing-CN and 2D Thing-CNNS were higher than those of C3N4 and 2D CNNS, indicating the effectiveness of the copolymerization of urea and ATCN and that the thiophene ring has been successfully embedded into C3N4.
Characterization
TEM, SEM, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments were performed to obtain more detailed information on the morphology and texture of the samples. The corresponding images are displayed in Fig. 1 and S2.† C3N4 exhibited an irregular compact layered structure (Fig. 1b and S2a†). But after high-temperature peeling at 620 °C, CNNS displayed a typical 2D nanosheet structure with some wrinkles and aggregation (Fig. 1c and S2b†). In addition, 0.10%-Thing-CN presents a porous alveolate structure with numerous in-plane holes after the incorporation of thiophene groups into C3N4 (Fig. 1d and S2c†), which is caused by the molecular doping process that changed the way of thermal condensation of the urea precursor.26,37 Unlike 2D CNNS, the 2D Thing-CNNS exhibited porous nanosheets with thinner and looser textures as well as a larger number of twisted wrinkles (Fig. 1e and S2d†). This distorted wrinkled lamellar architecture will not only contribute to activating intrinsic π → π* transitions but also trigger n → π* transitions in C3N4.24 A lattice spacing of 0.34 nm was observed in 0.10%-Thing-CN and 2D Thing-CNNS (Fig. 1f and g), which is larger than that of typical C3N4 (0.33 nm), which is due to the introduction of larger radius S atoms and lone pairs of electrons.38 Moreover, the HAADF-STEM image of 2D Thing-CNNS and the corresponding STEM-mapping show that C, N, O, and trace residual S were uniformly distributed on 2D Thing-CNNS (Fig. 1h and i). The AFM images show that C3N4, 2D CNNS, 0.10%-Thing-CN, and 2D Thing-CNNS possess a wrinkled nanosheet-like structure with a thickness of about 4.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 3.5 nm (Fig. 1j–m), which is in agreement with the TEM observation. This indicates that the sample thickness does not change with the intercalation of the thiophene ring. The thickness of the nanosheets decreased slightly after high temperature calcination.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded to investigate the crystal structure and crystallinity of the fabricated catalysts (Fig. 2a). C3N4 and X-Thing-CN exhibited two dominant peaks at around 13.1° and 27.2°, corresponding to (100) in-plane periodic packing of heptazine units and (002) aromatic interlayer stacking motifs, respectively.39 The width of the two characteristic peaks of X-Thing-CN is broadened with an increase in the ATCN content, caused by the accumulation of graphite and the incorporation of irregular Thing into the plane to decrease structural ordering.40,41 In contrast, the two peaks of 2D CNNS and 2D Thing-CNNS become narrower and sharper than those of other samples, indicating that their crystal structure is well-developed and condensed.42 Furthermore, the peak of X-Thing-CN at around 21° is gradually enhanced, which is a typical characteristic peak of the thiophene ring, indicating the successful intercalation of thiophene into C3N4.43 Additionally, the peaks of 2D CNNS and 2D Thing-CNNS shifted slightly to 27.7°, corresponding to the interlamellar spacing from 0.327 nm to 0.322 nm; the outcomes suggest that the layer stacking spacing is compacted, which may be ascribed to the strengthened van der Waals attractions between the heptazine layers.44 And the peak corresponding to the (100) crystal plane shifted from 13.1° to 12.6°, indicating that the layer spacing increased from 0.675 nm to 0.706 nm. Extending the stacking distance of crystal planes will break the hydrogen bond and distort the plane symmetry structure of the triazine units, which is beneficial for n → π* transitions.45

The FTIR spectra of C3N4, 2D CNNS, X-Thing-CN, and 2D Thing-CNNS are displayed in Fig. 2b. Similar characteristic peaks were observed for all catalysts. Broadbands ranging from 3000 to 3500 cm−1 stem from the vibration of –NH2/OH groups. Strong bands with a wavenumber of 1200–1700 cm−1 arise from CN heterocycles. The distinct absorptions at 810 cm−1 originated from the heptazine ring.46 No obvious extra typical peaks appeared in the broadband FT-IR spectra of 0.10%-Thing-CN and 2D Thing-CNNS, which may be ascribed to the strong IR response of C3N4 and the low content of ATCN or the weakened stretching vibrations of the symmetrical alkyl group that could hardly be recognized.41
The molecular structure of the synthesized catalysts was further characterized using solid-state 13C NMR spectra (Fig. 2c). 2D CNNS, X-Thing-CN, and 2D Thing-CNNS possess similar spectra to that of C3N4. Two different peaks were observed at 165.4 and 157.3 ppm, originating from the C(1) atom (CN2(–NH2)) and the C(2) atom (CN3), respectively.47 In all samples, no new special peaks were observed, which was mainly caused by the low content of the introduced thiophene, which could be verified by the 3%-Thing CN sample (Fig. 2c inset), where two clearly observed new broad peaks centered at 98 and 125 ppm indicate the incorporation of aromatic thiophene carbon species into the C3N4 conjugated network.37,48 Therefore, the introduction of small organic thiophene molecules did not destroy the intact skeleton structure of C3N4. However, when excessive ATCN was added, the peak for C(1) and C(2) atoms decreased and became fatter, indicating that excessive ATCN will reduce the crystallinity of C3N4.49,50 In addition, 2D Thing-CNNS have sharper spectral lines than C3N4, indicating the prohibited agglomeration, improved local molecular structure of 2D CNNS, and increased crystallinity.50
N2 sorption is recorded to measure the porous structures (Fig. 2d). The synthesized samples exhibited a type IV curve with an H3 hysteresis, which can reflected the presence of capillary agglomeration and the irregular porous structure in the catalysts.51 The mesoporous structure facilitates the capture of light and the mass diffusion of reactants. The pore size distribution by the t-plot method further determined the formation of similar pore diameter mesopores in the synthesized materials (Fig. 2d inset). 2D Thing-CNNS have a larger pore volume (0.37 cm3 g−1) compared to C3N4 (0.14 cm3 g−1) and 0.10%-Thing-CN (0.12 cm3 g−1), which was in agreement with TEM images. The higher pore volume of 2D Thing-CNNS originates from the in-plane pores and wrinkled structures. Correspondingly, the SSA of 2D Thing-CNNS is calculated to be ∼82.2 m2 g−1, larger than that of C3N4 (∼41.6 m2 g−1) and 0.10%-Thing-CN (40.7 m2 g−1), respectively (Table S2†). Theoretically, large SSA and pores volume is beneficial for mass-transfer processes, which will boost the kinetics of photocatalytic reactions.52
The C/N molar ratio in the bulk of photocatalysts was analyzed by elemental analysis (EA). The C/N mass ratio of X-Thing-CN gradually augmented from 0.566 to 0.678 when introducing the thiophene ring into C3N4 to equip thiophene sulfur species (Table S3†). These extra C and S elements were further measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Compared with C3N4 (0.562) and 0.10%-Thing-CN (0.570), the C/N ratios of both 2D CNNS (0.565) and 2D Thing-CNNS (0.572) were significantly increased, indicating that nitrogen defects were formed by high-temperature calcination.
XPS spectra were analyzed to investigate the elemental compositions and valent states of the synthesized catalysts. As seen in the full-range XPS survey in Fig. 3a, the prepared samples are composed of C, N, and O elements. No apparent peak of S was observed in 0.10%-Thing-CN and 2D Thing-CNNS because of the ultra-low loading of ATCN. The high-resolution C 1s XPS spectra showed three distinct peaks (Fig. 3b). The dominant peak with a binding energy at 288.1 eV corresponded to sp2 hybridized carbon (N–CN); the smaller one located at 285.6 eV is related to the sp2-bonded C where the edge of the s-triazine unit is connected to –NHx (C–NHx); the peak centered at 284.8 eV corresponded to adventitious hydrocarbons (C–C/CC).53,54 The peak intensity of the C–C signal increases for 0.10%-Thing-CN and 2D Thing-CNNS, resulting from the introduction of a thiophene ring in C3N4 to form C–CC instead of N–CN.27 The N 1s spectra (Fig. 3c) can be deconvoluted into three peaks at 398.5, 399.9, and 400.7 eV, matching with those of sp2 hybridized aromatic nitrogen (C–NC), tertiary nitrogen (C–(N)3), and amino nitrogen (C–N–H), respectively.55 Notably, the peak area ratios of C–NC/C–(N)3 for 2D CNNS (5.28) and 2D Thing-CNNS (5.03) both decrease compared with those of C3N4 (5.48) and 0.10%-Thing-CN (5.23) (Table S4†), indicating that some bridged N atoms are replaced by C during the copolymerization process and the preferential loss of nitrogen atoms at the C–NC site.56 In addition, the increased C–NHx peak area ratio further confirms the production of numerous C–N–H structural edges caused by the bridging C in 0.10%-Thing-CN and 2D Thing-CNNS, stemming from the thiophene ring.19 The S 2p spectra were scanned to verify the presence of thiophene rings in the samples (Fig. 3d). Two peaks centered at 164.0 and 165.2 eV corresponding to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 both exist in the 0.10%-Thing-CN and 2D Thing-CNNS samples. Due to their spin–orbit coupling, these two peaks are consistent with the reported 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 positions of thiophene-S. From this, it can be inferred that sulfur mainly exists in C3N4 in the form of a thiophene ring.37,57 Meanwhile, this is different from conventional sulfur-doped C3N4 (163.9 and 168.5 eV). Hence, it can be concluded that the thiophene ring has been successfully grafted on 0.10%-Thing-CN and 2D Thing-CNNS samples, rather than inducing C and S dopants.

The changes in morphology and architecture at nano/micro levels will cause the planar distortion of C3N4, which will remarkably affect the optical absorption and bandgap structure.45 As shown in Fig. 4a, C3N4 exhibited an absorption edge at around 460 nm attributable to the π → π* electron transitions. By contrast, a substantial difference in the photoresponse appears for X-Thing-CN. The absorption edges of X-Thing-CN red-shifted progressively to the near-infrared region (from 650 nm to above 900 nm) with an increasing ATCN content. Interestingly, an emerging absorption peak appears at approximately 490 nm, associated with the n → π* transitions.26,40 In addition, with the increase of thiophene, n → π* electron transitions are gradually enhanced. This phenomenon manifests the incorporation of the structure. Similarly, the same phenomenon also occurs for 2D CNNS and 2D Thing-CNNS, indicating that high-temperature re-pyrolysis will deform the C3N4 structure to induce n → π* transitions. These results indicate that the formation of nitrogen vacancies effectively reduces the band gap and enhances the light absorption of 2D Thing-CNNS. Furthermore, 2D Thing-CNNS further extend the light absorption edge and enhances n → π* transitions compared to 0.10%-Thing-CN. The further strengthened n → π* electronic transitions can be ascribed to the formation of curved nanosheets via post-heating at 620 °C in a N2 atmosphere.24 These results reveal that combining surface modification with the grafted thiophene ring and the re-pyrolysis strategy can synergistically facilitate n → π* electron transitions.

Hence, introducing thiophene as a strong electron donor can effectively expand the conjugated π-electron system.37 The band gaps of the C3N4, 2D CNNS, 0.10%-Thing-CN, and 2D Thing-CNNS are calculated using the converted Kubelka–Munk function to be 2.82, 2.97, 2.75, and 2.67 eV, respectively (Fig. 4b). The reduced bandgap of 2D Thing-CNNS is attributed to its expanded π-conjugated system and wrinkled nanosheet structure, which accelerates the movement of charges and makes the internal π → π* electron transitions easier to occur.24 The valence band (VB) positions measured by the XPS-VB spectroscopy (Fig. 4c) are 1.80, 1.87, 2.09, and 1.85 V vs. NHE, respectively. Therefore, the band structures of the prepared photocatalysts are depicted in Fig. 4d. And the corresponding conduction band (CB) is −1.02, −1.10, −0.66, and −0.82 V. vs. NHE (Fig. 4d).
Additionally, the emergence of n → π* transitions in 0.10%-Thing-CN and 2D Thing-CNNS photocatalysts can also be corroborated by reinforced steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy to estimate the recombination of photoexcited carriers.58,59 As shown in Fig. 5a, 0.10%-Thing-CN and 2D Thing-CNNS exhibited dramatic fluorescence quenching and red-shift compared with C3N4 and 2D CNNS, induced by the expansion of the π conjugate system.35 Additionally, grafting the thiophene ring onto carbon nitride can efficiently suppress the recombination of photoinduced carriers. C3N4 only displayed one emission peak at 458 nm in PL spectra, originating from π → π* transitions in the conjugated system. But for 2D CNNS, 0.10%-Thing-CN, and 2D Thing-CNNS, another peak emerged at 490 nm assigned to the n → π* electron transitions.24

Also, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) can indirectly confirm the occurrence of n → π* transitions. The prepared materials displayed a clear Lorentzian line centered at a g value of 2.0592 associated with unpaired electrons in the π-conjugated aromatic ring.60 Such n → π* electronic transitions will stimulate more nonbonding electrons in the catalyst.61 As a result, 2D CNNS, 0.10%-Thing-CN, and 2D Thing-CNNS with n → π* electron transitions exhibited an intensified signal and a larger span as compared with the EPR spectrum of C3N4, indicating the presence of more unpaired electrons (Fig. 5b). In addition, the formation of nitrogen vacancies can trigger the transport of more lone pair electrons through the delocalized π-conjugated network of C3N4, further exciting the n → π* electron transition.
The faster carrier transfer efficiency can be reflected by the average fluorescence lifetime (TR-PL). The average lifetime (τ) is calculated based on the formula  (where τ1 and τ2 are the fitted lifetimes and A1 and A2 are the corresponding proportions). As shown in Fig. 5c and Table S5,† The average lifetime of Thing-CN and 2D Thing-CNNS decays faster than that of C3N4 and 2D CNNS in 0–20 ns. At the same time, the τ values of C3N4, 2D CNNS, 0.10%-Thing-CN, and 2D Thing-CNNS are 5.8, 8.49, 3.09, and 2.92 ns, respectively. The decreased average lifetime of 0.10%-Thing-CN and 2D Thing-CNNS signified the enhanced excitation dissociation and accelerated the charge separation and transport.62 Furthermore, the separated efficiency of photoexcited carriers was investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and transient photocurrent (I–T). 2D Thing-CNNS possess an increased photocurrent response photocurrent density and a decreased Nyquist arc radius (Fig. 5d and S3†), demonstrating enhanced photocurrent intensity and lowered charge transfer resistance. This confirms that the enhanced n → π* electronic transitions can generate more charge carriers, increase conductivity, and accelerate interfacial charge transfer, indicating that grafting thiophene rings and constructing two-dimensional nanosheets effectively promote charge separation.
Computational and mechanistic studies
The DFT models of C3N4 and 2D Thing-CNNS are presented in Fig. 6a and d, in which a π-ring with an S atom is attached to a well-accepted C3N4 unit cell.31 This model incorporates thiophene in one unit cell, which has been confirmed by our XPS analysis. Furthermore, compared with C3N4, the conduction band position of 2D Thing-CNNS is shifted downward, closer to the Fermi level, indicating a higher electron concentration and higher conductivity of 2D Thing-CNNS.63 The HOCO and LUCO of the C3N4 model (Fig. 6b and c) are evenly distributed over the unit cell. After introducing the thiophene ring with an S atom, both the HOCO and LUCO of the 2D Thing-CNNS experienced significant rearrangements (Fig. 6e and f). The orbitals become highly asymmetric, with the HOCO concentrating towards the vicinity of the thiophene ring, while the LUCO shifts towards the opposite side of the cell, which represents the transition-of-charge from the thiophene ring towards the heptazine ring, triggering the n → π*electronic transition. The orbital separation will isolate individual redox sites and form separate redox islands, which helps reduce the recombination of photoinduced carriers due to the surface polarization.17,64 Strong suppression of the recombination in the 2D Thing-CNNS is observed from our experimental results, indicated by the smaller Nyquist arc radius and the stronger photocurrent. Hence, such changes in the orbital configurations are conducive to addressing the limitations of the pristine C3N4 photocatalyst and consequently enhancing photocatalytic performances.

The bandgap of C3N4 was estimated to be 2.54 eV (Fig. 7a), which is consistent with that in the previous report.32 For 2D Thing-CNNS, the bandgap was reduced to 1.94 eV (Fig. 7d). The reduction in the bandwidth agrees with the above experimental results. Hence, from the theoretical perspective, the absorption edge is red-shifted from 460 to 700 nm, extending from the blue light region into the red light region. This conclusion is consistent with our UV-vis results where the signal of 2D Thing-CNNS is significantly expanded to 700 nm. Furthermore, the extended absorption range coincides with the maximum in the solar spectrum, which will result in enhanced light-harvesting capability under solar radiation. The detailed contributions towards narrowing the bandgap with different bands and elements could be clarified from the partial DOS (PDOS). In both pristine C3N4 and 2D Thing-CNNS, the p band contributes to both the CB and VB close to the band edges (Fig. 7b and e). Here, the significantly increased DOS at the p band is the dominant factor for a narrower bandgap of 2D Thing-CNNS. For the elemental contribution, the additional C atoms have a major contribution to the reduced bandgap of 2D Thing-CNNS. On comparing Fig. 7c and f, it was found that the contributions from C atoms significantly increase for 2D Thing-CNNS, which pushes the CB toward the bottom and VB to the top, effectively reducing the bandgap. The theoretical analysis well explains the narrower bandgap of 2D Thing-CNNS upon grafting the thiophene ring and forming a thin layer via the re-pyrolysis strategy.

In the FEM modelling, the layered morphological features of C3N4 and 2D Thing-CNNS can be observed from the SEM and TEM images. Previous studies indicated that surface morphology significantly impacts the near electric field distribution.60 FEM models were constructed based on the layered structure, and the layer thickness and interlayer distance were 20 nm. According to the electromagnetic wave theory, the radiation field intensity is directly proportional to the square of the electric field. The electric near field distribution was obtained from the FEM results, which are presented in Fig. 8a, b and S4, S5.† The wave is transmitted from the top and vertically penetrates the layered structures downwards.
 Fig. 8  (a) The FEM results of the near electric field distribution of pristine C3N4, (b) the near electric field distribution of 2D Thing-CNNS, at an illumination wavelength of 350 nm and incident angle of 0°, (c) a comparison between the SIRI of C3N4 and 2D Thing-CNNS at a 0° incident angle, (d) radiation power absorption by 2D Thing-CNNS at different incident angles, normalized to that by C3N4 at the same angle, (e) ohmic heat generation by C3N4 at a 0° incident angle, and (f) ohmic heat generation by 2D Thing-CNNS at a 0° incident angle. 

Fig. 8a and b demonstrated the case with the 0° incident angle at 350 nm radiation wavelength. At the same photonic incident intensity, the electric field at the top surface (the thick black line in Fig. 8a and b) of 2D Thing-CNNS is higher than that of C3N4, which is consistent with the strengthened n → π* transitions. This effect is also observed at the top surface of different wavelengths and incident angles (Fig. S4 and S5†). Because the electric field has a considerable variation across the top surface of both materials, it is difficult to make an overall quantitative comparison. To address this issue, we adopted a new indicator, the surface integrated radiation intensity (SIRI), to assess the light-harvesting capability of different materials and morphological configurations. SIRI refers to the amount of energy emitted at a specific wavelength by an object at a specific time. Generally, the higher the radiation intensity, the better light-harvesting ability will be attained. The result for the 0° incident angle is given in Fig. 8c. Compared to C3N4, 2D Thing-CNNS exhibited a higher radiation exposure of the top surface within the wavelength range of 350–700 nm and achieved the highest increase of over 7% at 390 nm. The increase in the total SIRI has resulted from the increased SSA and enhanced surface field strength.60 As the top surface is in direct contact with the reactant and it encloses all the active sites, the observed higher radiation exposure in 2D Thing-CNNS helps enhance the driving force of the novel photocatalyst material.
With a stronger surface radiation exposure, 2D Thing-CNNS are expected to have a higher radiation absorption level within the top layers, which is supported by further analysis of the FEM results. When going downwards inside the structure, the field in 2D Thing-CNNS decreases more quickly, representing a lower electric field (Fig. S4 and S5†). This means that during the radiation transmission, more photon energy will be absorbed by 2D Thing-CNNS, which results in a faster field reduction. The absorbed energy can only be converted into hot carrier pairs or converted into heat due to the plasmonic effect, both of which will help promote photocatalysis. For all wavelengths and incident angles, the absorption is strong on 2D Thing-CNNS, and the attenuation is faster.
To make a quantitative assessment, the total radiation power absorption by C3N4 and 2D Thing-CNNS structures was calculated by integrating the normal power inflow over all the surfaces of the layered structures, using the equationA = ∮E × dS.where S is the Poynting vector representing the power flow in the radiation field; dS represents the differential surface element; the integration is over all the surface of the layered model, to account for both the inflow and outflow. The results are compared in Fig. S6.† For an overall comparison, the absorption of 2D Thing-CNNS at different incident angles was divided by that of C3N4, and the normalized results are plotted in Fig. 8d. Below a C3N4 absorption edge of 450 nm, the increase of absorption by 2D Thing-CNNS over C3N4 was only within two times for all incident angles. Greater absorption was observed at a longer wavelength, which attained 25 times at lower incident angles (0–30°), and even above 30 times at a 45° incident angle. This result is consistent with the narrowed bandwidth and increased absorption, particularly at longer wavelengths, of 2D Thing-CNNS, which was confirmed by both DFT and experimental results. Hot carrier generation induced by external radiation is the first step in a photocatalysis process, during which the number of generated hot carriers is directly proportional to photon absorption.65 Hence, the increase in radiation absorption will promote the generation of charge carriers, thus boosting surface redox reactions.66
Internal heat generation within the photocatalysts can increase the potential of a reaction and lower its energy barrier, thereby promoting photocatalytic performances, particularly metal nanoparticles which show a strong plasmonic effect.67 The heat-generating capability of semiconductor materials is not as strong as that of metals because of their lower thermal conductivity. Still, significant photoinduced heat has been observed within semiconductors, particularly below the photo-absorption edge.60 This work assessed light-induced heat generation within pristine and modified C3N4 using FEM. As indicated in Fig. 8e, f and S7,† the heat was produced on both C3N4 and 2D Thing-CNNS under light radiation, particularly in the top layers where the incoming field is stronger. A thermal color scale is used where the dark color indicates the low end of the heat generation, while the bright color represents the high end of the heat generation. The results suggest that more heat is generated by 2D Thing-CNNS, which also contributes to the promoted photocatalytic performance via boosting the dynamics at the surface region.
Photocatalytic activity
The photocatalytic performances of C3N4, 2D CNNS, X-Thing-CN, and 2D Thing-CNNS were evaluated by decomposing BPA under visible light. As illustrated in Fig. 9a, the degradation rate of X-Thing-CN first increases and then decreases with the increased loading of thiophene rings. The removal efficiency of BPA for 0.1%-Thing-CN was the highest through the performance optimization experiments. The fusing of excessive thiophene may distort the structure and reduce the crystallinity of C3N4, leading to the enhanced n → π* effect. Nevertheless, the degradation rate by the excessive doping of thiophene rings is still higher than that of C3N4 because of the n → π* transitions. Therefore, integrating the thiophene ring into C3N4 is beneficial for improving photocatalytic degradation performances. After exposure for 30 min to visible light, the degradation rates of C3N4, 2D CNNS, 0.10%-Thing-CN, and 2D Thing-CNNS to BPA were 10.2%, 29.6%, 76.9%, and 100%, respectively (Fig. 9b). The pronounced performance of 2D Thing-CNNS could be assigned to the enlarged SSA, expanded visible light absorption range, and rapid charge mobility. Hence, the grafted thiophene ring and constructed two-dimensional nanosheets synergistically boosted photooxidation. As such, 2D Thing-CNNS are very competitive amongst the C3N4-based photocatalysts. Besides, the first-order kinetic curves were evaluated. As depicted in Fig. 9c, ln(C/C0) and t show a good linear relationship. The reaction rate follows the order of 2D Thing-CNNS > 0.10%-Thing-CN > 2D CNNS > C3N4, and its specific first-order kinetic constant k is shown in Fig. S8.† The first-order-rate constant (k) of 2D Thing-CNNS (k = 0.128) for BPA degradation was relatively high, about 42.7 times that of C3N4 (k = 0.03). To evaluate the reusability and stability of 2D Thing-CNNS, four consecutive cycles of degradation were carried out as shown in Fig. 9d. The photocatalytic efficiency remained unchanged after four successive cycles, demonstrating its excellent stability.

Electron spin resonance (ESR) is a sensitive approach to clarifying the reactive species in the photodegradation process. As depicted in Fig. 10a and b, in the absence of light, neither C3N4 nor 2D Thing-CNNS samples produced  and ˙OH signals. When irradiated with visible light for 10 min, the radical signals of  (1:1:1:1) and DMPO–˙OH (1:2:2:1) are detected with 2D Thing-CNNS, and the peak intensity is greater than that of C3N4. 2D Thing-CNNS can generate more reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the reaction. To identify the primary ROS, we selectively screened each possible ROS induced by 2D Thing-CNNS (Fig. 10c). Triethanolamine (TEOA) and isopropanol (IPA) were used to capture h+ and ˙OH, and N2 was introduced to capture  during the reaction.68 After the addition of IPA, BPA degradation efficiency decreased to 47.7%, and the removal rate further decreased to 2.3% and 6.2% when purged with N2 and in the presence of TEOA, indicating that  and h+ are dominant ROS in the photodegradation of BPA. The results showed that  and h+ contributed more than 90% to the degradation of BPA, suggesting that the degradation mechanism of BPA did not belong to the conventional degradation pathway, and a connection may exist between the reactive oxidants during the reaction process. When irradiated with visible light, electrons from the VB of 2D Thing-CNNS are excited to the CB, leaving holes on the VB. Since the LOMO level position of BPA (−5.11 V) is lower than the CB of 2D Thing-CNNS (−0.82 V), electrons from the LUMO in BPA will recombine with h+ in 2D Thing-CNNS, while the electrons on the CB in 2D Thing-CNNS tend to activate oxygen to generate superoxide radicals, which has been confirmed by ESR. Due to the chain reaction, quenching one free radical will also deactivate the other free radicals. Furthermore, when the h+ were recombined, the effect of ˙OH is also weakened.
 Fig. 10  (a) ESR spectra of ˙O2− and (b) ˙OH, (c) quenching experiments, and (d) photocatalytic reaction mechanism of the prepared photocatalysts. 
From the above discussions, we elaborated the tentative mechanisms of photocatalytic BPA degradation over 2D Thing-CNNS (Fig. 10d). On the one hand, grafting a thiophene ring on the 2D nanosheets facilitated the activation of intrinsic π → π* transitions. On the other hand, thiophene, as an electron-rich compound, has a lone pair of electrons on the S element of thiophene. The lone pair electrons of thiophene S transition to the π-conjugated structure of C3N4 to trigger n → π* electron transitions. Additionally, the re-pyrolysis strategy can break the symmetric structure of C3N4, causing the C3N4 structure to bend to a certain extent, resulting in the exposure of the lone pair of carbon nitride electrons, thereby inducing n → π* electronic transitions. The n → π* transitions optimize the optical absorption and electron transport properties of C3N4, and enhance the surface field strength as well as radiative absorption. The thiophene ring can also rapidly capture photoexcited electrons and drive them to suitable active sites in localized micro-π-conjugated linking units, significantly improving the photocarrier separation efficiency. Furthermore, re-pyrolysis-derived two-dimensional nanosheets can remarkably increase SSA, thus providing more active sites and intensifying the mass-transfer process. These two promoting effects jointly make electrons and holes quickly migrate to the surface of the photocatalyst to initiate photo-redox reactions, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic performances for BPA degradation.
Conclusions
In summary, we successfully fabricated 2D Thing-CNNS with double n → π* electronic transitions via implanting thiophene rings and re-pyrolysis treatment. Fusing thiophene rings into the framework of C3N4 will distort the planar structure to induce n → π* transitions, thereby improving its optical absorption and electron transport properties. In addition, the 2D nanosheet structure formed by re-pyrolysis increases the SSA to provide abundant active sites for redox reactions and further stimulates the n → π* electronic transitions. The DFT calculations of the HOCO and LUCO implied that 2D Thing-CNNS are more conducive to photo-adsorption, electron–hole separation, and charge migration. 2D Thing-CNNS exhibited higher photocatalytic activity for BPA degradation, which was 10.2 times greater than that of pristine C3N4, respectively. The twisted ultrathin nanosheets, improved optical properties, reduced bandgap, fast charge migration, and increased SSA cooperatively boosted photocatalysis. This work provides a facile approach for initiating n → π* electronic transitions of C3N4 for efficient solar energy conversion toward environmental remediation.
