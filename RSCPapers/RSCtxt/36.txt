    , Accepted 19th December 2016First published on 19th December 2016AbstractThe practical applications of TiO2 have been greatly suppressed by its low quantum yield, which arises from the rapid recombination of photo-induced electrons and holes, and poor solar efficiency, which is determined by its band gap. Herein, W-doped TiO2 coupled with Au nanoparticles (W-TiO2/Au) was designed and synthesized by a facile multi-step process. The W-doping in the TiO2 lattice, on the one hand, can hinder the phase transition of TiO2 from anatase to rutile structure, and the pure anatase structure is well preserved. On the other hand, W-doping can narrow the band gap of TiO2 and result in oxygen vacancies, which may act as trapping sites to retard charge recombination. Furthermore, Au loading on the surface of TiO2 can effectively suppress the recombination of photo-induced electrons and holes, leading to improvement in the quantum yields of TiO2. Benefiting from the unique dual-hybrid strategy, the W-TiO2/Au catalyst possesses a strong solar adsorption narrowed band gap, abundant active sites, strong synergetic coupling, enhanced electron transfer, and high efficiencies in H2 generation. Its maximum H2 generation rate can reach as high as 24 mmol g−1 h−1 under simulated solar light. A synergetic effect was proposed to explain the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of TiO2.
Introduction
Today, energy and environment are two major issues that affect the development of human society. The overuse of fossil fuels has resulted in a series of problems, and splitting water to make renewable hydrogen using solar energy is the most direct and simple way to solve these problems. Among various photocatalysts developed to date, TiO2 is regarded as the best photocatalyst because of its cheapness, abundance, nontoxicity, and stability under photochemical conditions, and it has been widely investigated in the past 10 years. However, TiO2, possessing a large band gap (ca. 3.1 eV), is only active in the ultraviolet (UV) region, which accounts for less than 5% of the total energy of the solar spectrum.1 Much research has been focused on extending the TiO2 optical absorption spectrum into the visible region, typically by doping TiO2 with metal cations or nonmetal elements that generate donor or acceptor states in the band gap.2–12 When non-metal dopants are introduced, the optical absorption of TiO2 can be modified as the result of electronic transitions from the dopant 2p or 3p orbitals to the Ti 3d orbitals. For example, it has been demonstrated that N-doped TiO2 exhibits the greatest optical response to solar radiation.13 However, the latest studies have raised questions about this N-doping strategy and its suitability as the most efficient method by both theoretical and experimental investigations.14 Furthermore, the reported activity for the photoreduction of water to hydrogen is quite low by this N-doping strategy.15 On the other hand, the doping of metal cations, especially transition metal ions (such as Fe, Co, W, Ag, Mo, etc.), is also very effective for expanding the TiO2 optical absorption spectrum into the visible region. Among these metal ion dopants, W-doping of TiO2 has recently attracted interest because of its significant band gap narrowing and good visible-light photocatalytic activities,16–21 but there are few studies on W-doped TiO2 for H2 generation from water.
Another promising strategy in improving the visible light photoactivity of TiO2 is surface coverage by noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) owing to their unique surface plasmon resonance (SPR) properties.22,23 Among the various plasmonic metals, Au is the most widely studied metal because of its high stability and strong visible-light absorption over a wide range as we reported before.24–26 As a consequence, a series of Au/TiO2 catalysts have been developed for solar water splitting and photocatalytic degradation of organic compounds.27,28 To improve the photocatalytic activity of Au/TiO2 catalysts, most works mainly focus on improving the dispersion of Au NPs and the surface area of TiO2.29–31 Although the photocatalytic activity of the Au/TiO2 catalysts can be enhanced to some extent by the above strategies, they often display low visible-light absorption because of the limited contribution of TiO2, which absorbs only UV light. Au can effectively hinder the recombination of photo-induced electrons and holes, leading to an improvement in the quantum yields of TiO2, but it has only a slight effect on extending the photoresponse of TiO2 to the visible light region. In regards to the respective advantages of Au loading and W-doping, it can be speculated that the combination of these two aspects might be an effective route to achieve high photocatalytic activity of TiO2 under visible light.
Herein, we demonstrate a facile strategy to achieve highly efficient photocatalytic H2 production of TiO2 from water under simulated solar light irradiation. We achieve this aim by W-doping of TiO2 coupled with Au NPs. To prepare the dual-doping hybrid structure, excess H4SiW12O40 was employed not only as a W source for W-doping, but also as an efficient capping agent to stabilize the Au NPs. Thus, excess H4SiW12O40 can be adsorbed on the surface of the Au primary nanocrystallites, thus, hindering the crystal growth and leading to a fairly uniform distribution on the TiO2 surface. Under simulated solar light irradiation, the designed materials exhibited a high photocatalytic activity for H2 production from water with methanol as the sacrifice agent. Its maximum H2 generation rate can reach as high as 24 mmol g−1 h−1. Meanwhile, the catalyst showed a long life. A synergetic effect between W-doping and Au loading was responsible for the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of TiO2.
Experimental section
Materials
All chemicals, including H4SiW12O40·xH2O (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Beijing Co., Ltd, AR), HAuCl4·3H2O (Aladdin, Au > 48%), ethyl alcohol (Sinopharm, >99.7%), tetrabutyltitanate (TBOT, Sinopharm, >98%), K2PtCl6·6H2O (Aladdin, Pt > 45%), methanol (Sinopharm, >99.7%), and isopropanol (Aladdin, >98%) were used as received without any further purification.
Synthesis of W-TiO2/Au hybrids
In a typical synthesis, 15 mL of 0.1 mM H4SiW12O40 aqueous solution and 0.6 mL of isopropanol were fully mixed under Ar protection to form a colorless and transparent solution. After half an hour of UV light irradiation, the color of the solution changed from colorless to shallow blue, indicating the formation of heteropoly blue. Then, a certain amount of 5.885 mM HAuCl4 solution (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 mL) was rapidly injected into the blue solution, and the solution became shallow pink, indicating the formation of gold NPs. Subsequently, 4 mL of TBOT and isopropanol with a volume ratio of 1:1 was slowly pumped into the gold-containing solution under UV-light irradiation in an Ar atmosphere. The resultant precipitation was collected by centrifugation and washed thoroughly with deionized water and ethanol and was used as the precursor. After drying in the oven at 80 °C for 12 h, the precursor was annealed at 700 °C for 3 h at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 in a H2/Ar atmosphere (1:1, in volume). Finally, W-TiO2/Au hybrids with different loadings of Au were obtained (Table S1†).
Characterizations
The composition and phase purity of all samples were analyzed by a Shimadzu XRD-6000 X-ray diffractometer using Cu-Kα (λ = 1.54178 Å) irradiation with a scan rate of 6° per minute, operated at 40 kV voltage and 50 mA current. The morphology and microstructure of the samples were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL S-4800) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2010). Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were taken on a JEOL ARM 200F HAADF operating at 200 kV accelerating voltage. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra were achieved using a Shimadzu UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-3600). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on an ESCALAB 250 spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer) to characterize the surface composition. The impendence spectra were recorded on a CHI-660D potentiostat. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded on a JES-FA200 spectrometer at an X-band frequency of 9.070 GHz, sweep width of 750.00 Gauss, and center field of 3550.00 Gauss.
Photocatalytic H2 production by simulated solar light
The photocatalytic H2 production was performed with 0.02 g of photocatalyst suspended in 100 mL of methanol aqueous solution (50 vol%) in a closed circulation system using a xenon arc lamp (300 W, CEL-HXF300, Jinyuan). A certain amount of K2PtCl6·6H2O aqueous solution was dripped into the system to load Pt onto the surface of the photocatalyst by a photochemical reduction deposition method. The amount of H2 was analyzed by gas chromatography (N2000, Zhejiang University) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (N2 carrier), which was connected to the gas circulating line.
Results and discussion
Sample preparation and characterizations

Scheme 1 schematically illustrates the preparation procedure of W-TiO2/Au hybrid, which involves several steps. H4SiW12O40 (HSiW) used in our experiment serves multiple roles, the W source for W-doping and the reducing and capping agent. First, HSiW was reduced to heteropoly blue by isopropanol (IPA) under mercury lamp irradiation. Then, the HAuCl4 was reduced by the as-formed heteropoly blue to form Au NPs, and, simultaneously, SiW12O404− was coated on the surface of the Au NPs to hinder the further growth of the Au crystals.32 Subsequently, tetrabutyltitanate (TBOT) was added into the as-formed Au colloid solution, and the hydrolysis of TBOT occurred rapidly to form TiO2 accompanied with coupling with the Au NPs. The formed sample was named as the precursor. Finally, W-TiO2/Au was obtained by annealing the precursor in a H2/Ar atmosphere (H2, 7% in vol%). Synthetic details are described in the ESI.† The W-TiO2/Au samples obtained with different amounts of HAuCl4 solution were denoted as W-TiO2/Au-X (X = A, B, C, D, E, and F).

Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of W-TiO2/Au samples obtained with different amounts of HAuCl4 solution. It can be clearly seen that the anatase TiO2 phase coexists with Au in all samples. The peaks at 25.3, 37.8, 48.1, 54.0, 55.1 and 62.8 can be assigned to anatase TiO2 (JCPDS card no. 21-1272), while those at 44.4, 64.6, and 77.5 can be indexed to Au (JCPDS card no. 04-0784). The XRD patterns also revealed that as the amount of HAuCl4 increases, the Au diffraction peaks gradually strengthen accordingly and the colour of these samples also becomes deeper (Fig. 1, left). The XRD patterns in a narrow 2θ range of 24–27° show that the diffraction peaks of anatase TiO2 become slightly wider with an increase in the amount of HAuCl4, which is probably because of the fact that the W species suppresses the crystallization of TiO2. However, we did not observe diffraction peak shifts in the XRD patterns of TiO2 due to W-doping. This is because the radius (60 pm) of W6+ is very close to that (60.5 pm) of Ti4+,33 and W-doping did not significantly change the unit cell parameters of TiO2. Moreover, rutile TiO2 did not emerge in these samples, in spite of the higher annealing temperature. Several studies have reported similar behaviour when W is incorporated in TiO2.34 It was suggested that the W species concentrate on the surface of the TiO2 grains, hindering both the crystal growth of TiO2 and its phase transition from anatase to rutile structure.35,36 Tungsten oxide or other crystalline forms of tungsten compounds were not detected, which is agreement with the analysis. It has been demonstrated that the segregation of crystalline tungsten oxide will form only after annealing at temperatures as high as 1000 °C.37

Fig. 2a displays a representative field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) image of a typical sample of W-TiO2/Au-D, which shows that the sample is composed of relatively uniform spherical TiO2 NPs covered by Au NPs. Other samples exhibit a similar morphology (Fig. S1†). The size of the TiO2 NPs is approximately 30 nm in diameter and that of Au NPs is about 15 nm (Fig. 2a). The TiO2 NPs were highly crystalline, which can be confirmed by the well resolved lattice fringes in the high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images (Fig. 2b and c). Clearly, the W species are highly dispersed and too small to be detected by the common high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) image (Fig. 2f). Fortunately, the W species can be detected by the HAADF-STEM technique. The HAADF-STEM images (Fig. 2b and c) with sub-angstrom resolution clearly show that the W species, which are marked with red circles, are uniformly dispersed over the TiO2 support. Careful examination found that the individual W atoms occupy exactly the positions of the Ti atoms, indicating that W has been successfully doped into the single-atom form and the doped atoms did not change the surface crystal lattice fringes.38,39 The detected lattice fringes with spacings of 0.23 and 0.35 nm correspond to the (004) and (101) planes of TiO2, respectively.40,41 This fact is corroborated by the above XRD pattern (Fig. 1). Fig. 2d presents a low-magnification HAADF-STEM image of W-TiO2/Au. We can see that the W species are distributed on the surface of the Au NPs. Since the atomic number of Au is slightly larger than that of W, the background of the Au HAADF image is brighter than that of W. By examining the different regions, we did not detect any aggregation of the W species, which suggests that H4SiW12O40 plays an important role in the homogeneous doping of the W species for TiO2. The HAADF-STEM image (Fig. 2e) of an individual Au NP shows that the Au particle is a well-defined twinned crystal. It has been reported that H4SiW12O40 can absorb on the Au NP surface during the reduction process,42 which may be responsible for the formation of the Au twinned crystals.

Fig. 3a shows the UV-vis absorbance spectra of a series of W-TiO2/Au samples. A significant increase in the absorbance at wavelengths higher than 450 nm was observed, which could be attributed to the plasmon resonance absorbance of the Au NPs. Compared to pristine TiO2, the W-TiO2/Au samples have an obviously red shift in the band gap transition (Fig. 3b). From A to F, the red shift in the band gap gradually increases. Further observation indicates that the intensity of the surface plasmon absorbance and the red shift both increase with an increase in the HAuCl4 amount, which is probably due to the fact that more Au NPs have been embedded or loaded in TiO2 aggregates. The enhanced light absorption in the visible light region can therefore increase the quantities of photo-generated electrons and holes that participate in photocatalytic reactions.

Catalytic property studies
To disclose the advantages of the newly-designed W-TiO2/Au hybrids for water splitting, the photocatalytic activities for water splitting were evaluated. A full-spectrum solar simulator was used as the excitation source, which produced about 1 sun power at the sample when placed in a Pyrex glass container filled with a 1:1 water–methanol solution (methanol is the sacrificial reagent). Fig. 4a shows the time course of the H2 production of W-TiO2/Au hybrids under simulated solar light irradiation. Clearly, for W-TiO2/Au samples (from A to D), as the Au content increases, the H2 generation rate also increases gradually, and the W-TiO2/Au-D sample exhibits the highest H2 generation rate of about 24 mmol g−1 h−1. When the Au content further increases, a lower photocatalytic activity was observed for both W-TiO2/Au-E and W-TiO2/Au-F with the higher content of Au loading. This may be because the higher content of Au loading not only blocks the surface active sites, but also hinders the light reaching the catalyst surface, lowering its photocatalytic activity.

(f) Recyclability of the typical W-TiO2/Au sample for H2 evolution under simulated solar light irradiation. 
To elucidate the effects of Au loading and W-doping on the photocatalytic activity of TiO2, the H2 generation rates of W-TiO2 without Au loading and Au-TiO2 without W-doping were also measured under the same test conditions. As expected, little H2 evolution was observed for the two cases (Fig. 4a and b).
To get a comprehensive understanding of W-TiO2/Au catalysts, the photoelectrochemical properties were studied. Fig. 4c presents the current density versus potential (J–V) curves. The J–V curve of pristine TiO2 under dark conditions exhibited a horizontal line and negligible current density at 0 V, indicating that the current does not increase significantly when swept under dark conditions. However, for the W-TiO2/Au catalysts, the J–V curves first showed a photocurrent increase and then achieved a saturated photocurrent density when swept under light conditions. At 0.8 V, W-TiO2/Au-D produced the highest photocurrent (1.7 mA cm−2), whereas W-TiO2/Au-A produced ∼0.25 mA cm−2. These results validate the choice of W-TiO2/Au-D as a kind of promising material for the photo-anode among these candidates. Amperometric on–off current–time curves further corroborate these observations (Fig. 4d). Fig. 4d shows the photocurrent responses of these tested catalysts to on–off cycling recorded at +0.8 V bias. Photocurrent responses were measured using an electrochemical analyzer (CHI660D) in a home-made standard three compartment cell. Platinum foil was used as the counterelectrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. All the working electrodes were prepared by drop-coating the sample suspensions onto the conductive surface of cleaned indium tin oxide glass (ITO glass) (ca. 2.8 cm2) by microsyringe and drying under an infrared heat lamp. The geometrical surface areas of the working electrode exposed to the electrolyte were circular films of 1.6 cm2. A 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution was used as the supporting electrolyte.
Clearly, bare TiO2 generated a negligible photocurrent, while W-TiO2 or TiO2/Au both showed very weak photocurrent. By contrast, W-TiO2/Au samples exhibited a significantly improved photocurrent compared to W-TiO2, TiO2/Au and TiO2. For these W-TiO2/Au samples, their photocurrent order is consistent with their hydrogen generation rate. Among these W-TiO2/Au samples, the W-TiO2/Au-D sample showed the highest photocurrent. Prompt photocurrent generation was observed once the light was turned on, and the photocurrent value decreased to near zero as soon as the light was turned off. The prompt photocurrent response of this sample indicates its highly efficient separation and transfer of the charge under simulated solar light irradiation.
Under the solar simulator illumination (UV spectrum matched to AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 total power density), the W-TiO2/Au-D sample produced a photocurrent density of 1.7 mA cm−2 at 0.8 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) (Fig. 4c). In Fig. 4e, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) of these samples were measured at 0.8 V versus RHE, the potential that is required to achieve the saturated photocurrent density of the W-TiO2/Au hybrids. The maximum IPCE for W-TiO2/Au-A is about 15% at 370 nm, whereas the W-TiO2/Au-D sample has a maximum IPCE of 75% at 380 nm. IPCE was calculated according to eqn (1), where the Iph is the intensity of photocurrent, p is the power of input light, and λ is the wavelength of input light. (1)
It can be observed that the absorption wavelengths corresponding to the maximum IPCE of A–F samples gradually shifted from 370 nm to 400 nm. W-Doping leads to a narrow band energy, which results in a broadening of the absorption band. The integral area of IPCE is also consistent with the catalytic performance.
The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was calculated from the ratio of the number of reacted electrons during hydrogen evolution to the number of incident photons according to eqn (2), where nH2 is the amount of the photogenerated H2 and np is the amount of incident photons, which were determined using a Ray virtual radiation actinometer (CEL-NP2000, silicon ray detector, light spectrum, 190–2500 nm, sensitivity, 1 μW, φ 10 mm, 0.75 cm2) with an uncertainty of 5%. Although the photocatalytic apparent quantum yields appear to vary according to the reaction conditions and the measurement methods (Table 1), here we can make a comparison within the group.

Recyclability as an important feature of the catalyst was also studied. We can see that W-TiO2/Au hybrid catalysts exhibit substantial activity and stability in photocatalytic H2 production under simulated solar light irradiation. H2 evolution as a function of time during one week with 42 h of overall solar irradiation time using W-TiO2/Au-D as the photocatalyst is shown in Fig. 4f. Measurements were conducted initially for 7 consecutive days; each day the sample was irradiated for 6 h and then wrapped with aluminum foil and stored in darkness overnight before testing the next day. It can be seen that 1 h of solar irradiation generated 0.64 mmol of H2 using 0.026 g of W-TiO2/Au-D catalyst, which corresponds to a H2 generation rate of 24 mmol g−1 h−1. This H2 production rate is about six times greater than those of most semiconductor photocatalysts.43,44 After testing every two days, 14 mL of pure water were added to compensate for the loss, and a similar H2 evolution rate was observed during one week. Throughout the testing cycles, we can see that the W-TiO2/Au-D catalyst exhibited persistently high H2 production capability. Under the same experimental conditions, W-TiO2 and TiO2/Au were also detected, and in both cases, the H2 production rate was no more than 1 mmol g−1 h−1. According to these results, the synergistic effect of Au NPs and W-doping is responsible for the excellent photocatalytic H2 generation performance of TiO2.
XPS and EPR spectroscopic studies
To better understand the surface structure and the excellent photocatalytic activity of the W-TiO2/Au hybrids, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on W-TiO2/Au-D. Fig. 5a shows a high resolution XPS spectrum of Au. Two peaks at the binding energies of 83.6 (Au 4f7/2) and 86.9 eV (Au 4f5/2) can be clearly observed, and they are assigned to metallic Au0. It is worth noting here that a significant negative shift (ca. 0.4 eV) of the binding energy for Au 4f7/2 relative to 84.0 eV in the bulk Au was identified,45 which is probably due to the electron transfer from the oxygen vacancies of TiO2 to Au, leading to a lower Au 4f7/2 binding energy in the W-TiO2/Au-D catalyst. Meantime, a similar negative shift in Au 4f5/2 at 86.9 eV relative to 87.5 eV was also observed. No other noticeable peaks at higher binding energies were detected, confirming the absence of oxidized gold species. Fig. 5b displays O 1s XPS spectra, which can be resolved into three peaks at about 530.0, 530.5 and 532.5 eV, respectively. The first one at 530.0 V can be assigned to typical metal–oxygen bonds (Ti–O or W–O), while the other two at 530.5 and 532.3 eV can be attributed to Ti–OH species and adsorbed H2O.46 This fact clearly indicates that although the W-TiO2/Au-D catalyst was obtained at 700 °C, it still has more hydroxyl groups. For the W 4f XPS spectra (Fig. 5c), the peaks located at 35.6 and 37.7 eV were assigned to 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 of W6+, whereas the peaks at 37.1 and 39.2 eV come from the contributions from the Ti 3p level and Ti–O–W, respectively.47,48Fig. 5d shows Ti 2p XPS spectra in which the binding energies at 458.8 and 464.5 eV can be ascribed to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of Ti4+, and no peaks corresponding to Ti3+ were detected.
 Fig. 5  High resolution XPS spectra of Au (a), O (b), W (c), and Ti (d). 
To confirm the existence of a large number of defect sites on the catalyst surface, the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were tested at 77 K to characterize the W-TiO2/Au samples. As shown in Fig. 6a, it can be clearly seen that all samples with different Au loadings have the same EPR signal (g = 2.02), which is assigned to the oxygen-centred surface hole trapping sites. It should be noted that from sample A to D, the one with a higher H2 generation rate also has a higher g-value intensity, which is in good agreement with the H2 generation rate and photocurrent results discussed above. However, for E and F, although their g-value intensities are higher than those of the first four samples, their catalytic ability was not improved. This is a very interesting phenomenon, and the exact reason is not clear. The high concentration of oxygen vacancies could break the selection rule for indirect transitions, resulting in an enhanced absorption for photon energy below the direct band gap.6 The formation of the oxygen vacancies results from the replacement of Ti4+ by W6+ in TiO2. As a consequence, the concentration of the oxygen vacancies increases with the concentration increase in the tungsten from A to F. In addition, upon illumination of the sample D with UV light for 2 min, the g value also increased more than before (Fig. 6b). This phenomenon indicates the efficient separation of the photo-generated electrons and holes.

A schematic illustration for the charge separation and transfer in the W-TiO2/Au is shown in Fig. 7. Driven by sun light, electrons (e−) are excited from the VB to the CB of the catalyst and then likely transfer to the Au NPs or Pt located on the catalyst. The hydrogen ion is reduced to H2 while the methanol is oxidized (Fig. 7a). Compared to pristine TiO2, the catalyst exhibits a narrowed band gap since W-doping in TiO2 moved the conduction band of TiO2 downward, leading to the red shift in the optical absorbance. Furthermore, relative to the vacuum level, the work function of the clusters ranges from about −2.0 eV for n = 1 to −5.1 eV for the bulk Au.49–52 As n increases to large numbers, it yields cluster sizes, nano sizes, and the bulk Au. The Au NPs with 15 nm diameters obtained with the heteropoly blue as the reduction in this experiment have a specific work function. For efficient electron transfer from the doped TiO2 conduction band to the Au NPs, the conduction band level must lie close to, or higher than, the Au work function, and the valence band level must lie far away, or much lower than, the Au work function. Only in this way, the Au particles are more likely to receive photoelectrons rather than holes, avoiding the recombination centre and prolonging the lifetime of the photoelectrons. So, the catalytic activity is more effective (Fig. 7b), for example, for the samples from W-TiO2/Au-A to W-TiO2/Au-D. However, an excess amount of O vacancies resulting from W species on the catalyst surface could also lead to increased recombination, thus decreasing the photocatalytic activity. In addition, an excess amount of Au loading on TiO2 not only influences the penetration of the visible light but also covers the surface active sites, lowering the photocatalytic activity. This result explains the fact that W-TiO2/Au-E and W-TiO2/Au-F have poorer photocatalytic activity towards H2 generation. This is also the reason why the catalytic ability does not increase with the enhancement of the g-value intensity in Fig. 6a.

According to the above analysis, we deduced that a synergistic effect of W-doping and Au loading in TiO2 may contribute to the significant enhancement in the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 toward H2 generation under a full-spectrum solar simulator. First, W-doping in TiO2 can move the conduction band of TiO2 downward (i.e., positive shift) since WO3 has a lower CB edge than that of TiO2, thus effectively narrowing the band gap of TiO2 and helping to shift the optical absorbance toward the visible region. On the other hand, according to the above EPR analysis, we know that W-doping can result in oxygen vacancies, which may act as trapping sites to retard charge recombination. Therefore, W-doping can not only narrow the band gap of TiO2, but it can also induce the effective separation of the photo-generated electrons and holes. Subsequently, the photoexcited electrons from the conduction band of W-TiO2 could move easily to the Au NPs because the work function of Au is lower than W-TiO2. Next the electrons transfer to Pt deposited on the surface of TiO2, and eventually they react with the adsorbed H+ ions to produce H2. As a consequence of these processes, effective separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers are achieved, resulting in the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity. Therefore, the synergetic effect of W doping and Au loading undoubtedly is responsible for the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of TiO2.
Conclusions
Briefly, W-doped TiO2 coupled with Au NPs with high photocatalytic activity towards H2 generation have been designed and prepared using a dual-step method. W doping not only retards the phase transition of TiO2 from anatase to rutile, but also effectively narrows the band gap of TiO2 and is beneficial for the optical absorbance toward the visible region. On the other hand, Au loading can enhance the light harvestation property and increase the surface charge separation process in the visible range due to SPR property. The highest hydrogen generation rate of W-TiO2/Au-D is up to 24 mmol g−1 h−1 under simulated solar light irradiation, which is about six times greater than that of most of semiconductor photocatalysts. The synergetic effects of the narrowed band gap, more oxygen vacancies, effective charge transfer, and good light harvestation properties enhance the stability and the photocatalytic H2 production.
