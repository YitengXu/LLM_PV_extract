    , Accepted 8th July 2022First published on 9th July 2022AbstractThe development of nanomaterials and their related electrochemical energy storage (EES) devices can provide solutions for improving the performance and development of existing EES systems owing to their high electronic conductivity and ion transport and abundant embeddable sites. Recent progress has demonstrated that metal selenides are attracting increasing attention in the field of EES because of their unique structures, high theoretical capacities, rich element resources, and high conductivity. However, there are still many challenges in their application in EES, and thus the use of nanoscale metal selenide materials in commercial devices is limited. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the nanostructured design of metal selenides (e.g., zero-, one-, two-, and three-dimensional, and self-supported structures) and present their advantages in terms of EES performance. Moreover, some remarks on the potential challenges and research prospects of nanostructured metal selenides in the field of EES are presented.
1. Introduction
The global energy industry is undergoing a huge and rapid transition to clean energy, which is driven by the demand for energy storage systems, electric vehicles, portable consumer electronics based on wind and solar energy, the Internet of Things and wearable technologies, and thus reversible storage is becoming an indispensable technology. However, these applications require a large number of improvements and diverse electrochemical energy storage (EES) technologies including lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), potassium-ion batteries (PIBs), and supercapacitors (SCs). In this case, electrochemically active materials with nanoscale structural features can transform the redox process of energy storage from the inside of the electrode to surface reactions, thereby greatly improving the power performance and cycle life.1–3 Specifically, nanostructures not only can provide significantly improved electronic conductivity and ion transport in the electrochemical process, but also have rich available reaction sites in their particle volume, resulting in rapid ion diffusion and high specific capacity. Additionally, the unique flexibility of low-dimensional materials provides a promising solution for the construction of ultra-thin flexible energy storage devices. These characteristics make it possible to realize the design of high-power density and high-energy density electrodes.
With the rapid development in the past few decades, a database of nanomaterials with different shapes and rich chemical compositions has been formed, covering transition metals and their oxides, sulfides, selenides, nitrides, phosphides, and carbides. Among the various types of materials, transition metal chalcogenides are considered promising EES electrode materials because of their rich earth elements and high specific capacities.4,5 As early as 1980, titanium disulfide was reported as an electrode material for LIBs. According to laboratory tests, it shows a high capacity and long cycle life.6 Notably, metal selenides have a similar structure to that of sulfides, while metal selenides show higher electrical conductivity, which is due to the much higher conductivity of Se than S and the weak chemical bond between metals and selenium.7,8 Meanwhile, considering the ionic transport and electronic conduction properties of nanostructures, nanostructured metal selenides are highly competitive for use in EES. In addition, the metal selenide architectures include various particle morphologies, such as zero-dimensional (0D), one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), three-dimensional (3D), and self-supported nanostructures. These different nanoscale building blocks can be used as structural units to construct electrodes for energy storage systems, thereby creating energy storage devices with wearable functions and special structures that cannot be achieved with traditional materials. However, to achieve the future development goal of intelligent assembly from nanomaterials to architectures, a comprehensive analysis of the structure–activity relationship between the morphologies ranging from 0D to 1D, 2D, 3D, and self-supported electrode structures and electrochemical properties of metal selenide nanostructured materials will help to promote their practical application in the field of EES. Considering that nanostructure is the key to understanding various charge storage mechanisms and improving the electrochemical performances of materials, such as surface ion adsorption, pseudo-capacitance, and diffusion-limited intercalation processes, vigorously promoting the successful application of metal selenide nanostructured materials in the field of EES will have manifold benefits.
2. The advantages and challenges of nanomaterial platforms in energy storage applications
In nanoscale systems, ion migration occurs at the electrode surfaces or in inter-electrode voids, whereas in conventional materials it typically occurs in solid electrodes. Meanwhile, nanoscale structures provide a higher specific surface area, abundant active sites for related reactions and alleviate the volume changes of electrode materials during electrochemical reactions. Generally, the size of materials has an effect on their physicochemical properties such as thermal, electrical, and optical properties. Specifically, nanosized materials can be divided into 0D, 1D, 2D, 3D, and self-supported structures. The morphology of 0D materials is characterized by structures with dimensions less than 100 nm on each axis, 1D materials characterized by nanorods, nanofibers, nanowires, and nanotubes, 2D materials characterized by nanosheets or nanoplates, and 3D materials are composed of the above-mentioned three types of dimensional structures. Besides, self-supported structures are constructed by directly growing active materials on the current collector. Different dimensional structures have advantages and disadvantages.
In the case of 0D structures, their small sizes in all dimensions can effectively increase the solid–liquid interface, alleviate volume expansion, shorten the ionic diffusion distance, and provide a large number of channels for ion/electron transfer, thereby enhancing the capacity contributions.9,10 Especially in SCs, where charge storage occurs on the surface of the active materials, their large surface area provides abundant electrochemically active sites. Moreover, this 0D structure can be integrated with almost any electrode system or directly used for ink printing. However, despite these advantages, 0D nanoparticles also face some tougher challenges compared to other nanostructures, such as excessive and unstable growth of SEIs for alkali metal (Li/Na/K)-ion battery anode materials, which can lead to reduced cycle stability and low Coulomb efficiency, noticeable particle fragmentation despite the minimal volume expansion, and negligible interior surfaces for electrochemical processes of SCs due to their low mesoporosity.1,2 In this regard, 0D nanoparticles can be composited with carbon sources or assembled into microscale secondary particles to effectively improve the electrochemical performance of 0D nanoparticle-based anodes.
In the case of 1D nanomaterials, a major advantage is that they can provide fast electron transport along the 1D direction and short ionic diffusion pathways along the radial direction.11 As a conductive additive, 1D carbon nanotubes have been widely used in many battery systems.12 In addition, for 1D nanostructures with highly porous features, their empty spaces are beneficial for relieving the volume changes associated with the interaction with alkali metal ions and accelerating electrolyte ion transport in SC applications, thereby enhancing the performance of EES devices.13 However, the low packing density of 1D nanostructures makes the design of electrode structures with high volumetric energy density challenging.3 Thus, to benefit from the their useful properties and mitigate their negative effects, the voids between 1D nanostructures can be filled with 0D nanoparticles, thereby enhancing their volumetric performance.
2D nanomaterials composed of atomic or near-atomic thickness have great lateral dimensions and large surface-to-volume ratio, which endow them with more effective active sites for surface charge-reactive applications, such as SCs and conversion-type selenide anodes. Additionally, for intrinsically layer-structured substances, the wide interlayer spacing between nanosheets and their natural electronic properties facilitate fast alkali metal-ion and electron transfer, making them popular candidates for electronic devices, especially fast-charging devices.14,15 However, although 2D structures can provide high in-plane electronic conductivity, it may be a challenge to achieve ionic or electronic conduction between layers. Moreover, the restacking of 2D structures in some cases can impede full utilization of their surface area and even blocks the electrolyte access.16 Accordingly, an effective strategy to overcome these limitations is to hybridize 2D nanostructures with 0D and 1D nanomaterials to construct multiscale composite structures, thereby reducing the packing of 2D structures, and simultaneously optimizing the ionic and electronic conduction between layers.
In the case of 3D nanomaterials, most of them are assembled from 0D, 1D, and 2D nanostructures, thus integrating the features of different dimensional structures. Among them, 3D self-supported structures not only inherit the advantages of different dimensional structures, but also prevent the electrode materials from aggregating during electrochemical reactions due to the strong effect of the substrate and electrode materials.9,17,18 In addition, from a certain point of view, self-supported structures built using conductive substrates do not need current collectors, which can further load more active materials.
3. Brief summary of the methods for the synthesis of various dimensional metal selenide architectures
Considering that there are various metal selenides, including different types of structures (layered and non-layered),19,20 diverse methods have been developed for their synthesis. Generally, there are several types of methods their synthesis including liquid reaction, templating, colloidal, electrospinning, and thermal annealing methods. Firstly, in the liquid reaction method, the hydro-/solvothermal synthesis conditions usually require both high temperature and high pressure, where the water or organic solvents are used as the reaction medium and the reaction temperature is close to or higher than the boiling point of the solvent.21,22 This method has wide applicability for the preparation of various dimensional structures, such as 2D Ni3Se2 nanowires and VSe2 nanosheets,22,23 and 3D core–shell CNT@MoSe2 nanotubular sponge.24 In general, morphology evolution frequently happens in hydro-/solvothermal synthesis with a change in temperature, reaction time, solvent, ligand, and facet-specific capping agent, thus enabling the synthesis of target products with different morphologies by changing the reaction conditions in some cases (Fig. 1a).25 Nevertheless, the complex preparation conditions make it difficult to precisely control the target compounds. Secondly, the templating method is beneficial to prepare nanostructures with special shapes and regularity, such as hollow FeSe2/graphitic-carbon (GC) spheres,26 NiSe0.85Se/C hollow nanowires,27 and CoSe/C dodecahedra.28 It generally involves a two-step synthetic process, where the template precursor is initially prepared, and then selenized. Currently, the commonly used templates include porous metal foams, salts, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), silica, ice crystals, and fixed-shape nanostructures (Fig. 1b).29 Among them, salts have the characteristics of water solubility, chemical stability, low cost, and reusability, and thus they can be directly used as templates to design 3D porous structures.30 In a typical synthesis, carbon precursors and inorganic salts are mixed, and the following selenization processes convert the carbon precursors into carbon. Other 3D structural templates have the characteristics of large specific surface area and porous structure, and thus have been widely used in energy storage.31,32 It is unique that the templating method is suitable for both liquid reaction and solid reaction systems. Additionally, the colloidal method is often used for the preparation of ultra-small monodisperse nanostructures. It usually involves the use of metal salts and selenium sources as the precursors, which react at relatively high temperatures in a high boiling-point organic solvent (Fig. 1c).33 Thus, high-quality nanocrystals with narrow size distributions and good crystallinity can be produced. The key point to achieving monodisperse nanocrystals is the separation of the nucleation and growth of nanocrystals during their synthesis. Specifically, a short, fast nucleation period is initially required, and then the nuclei grow without further nucleation. This unique nanostructure can buffer the large volume changes during cycling, thus promoting the EES performance. However, performing large-scale synthesis remains a challenge owing to the complicated procedure and low yield of this method. Further, the electrospinning method is a simple, common, and low-cost method for the preparation of typical 1D structures. The precursor mixtures are dispersed homogenously in solution, and then put in syringe with high-voltage electric fields to spin, and after a series of post-treatments, the target fibers are obtained (Fig. 1d).34–38 The electrospun nanofibers can be modified into multi-hierarchical structures. These multi-hierarchically structured nanomaterials can provide larger specific surface areas and additional structural interfaces, which play crucial roles in enhancing the electrochemical performance. Therefore, the electrospun products with various structures, such as solid fibers, porous fibers, core–shell fibers, nanotubes, and nanowires, can be used to develop different alkali metal-ion batteries and SCs, which have attracted extensive attention. Finally, in the thermal annealing method, which has broad scope, usually precursors containing metal salts and organic species are heated with selenium power or its compound in a tubular furnace under inert gas or reducing atmospheres (Fig. 1e).28,39,40 Generally, the organic species present in these precursors can be converted into a carbon layer, producing abundant pores from the release of gas or introduction of heteroatoms such as N, P, and S. It is worth noting that during the annealing process at high temperature, the crystallinity can be enhanced, and simultaneously the energy performance can also be improved obviously, benefiting from the incorporation of rich heteroatoms. This is a simple approach to synthesize metal selenides, especially for the preparation of some unique nanostructures by directly selenizing regularly shaped precursors.

Besides designing various electrode materials singly, engineering electrodes combined with the design of materials is also an effective strategy for ameliorating electrochemical properties.24,41 There are two common methods for the preparation of electrodes, i.e., coating the active material slurry on the electrode and directly preparing self-supported electrodes. It is worth noting that the slurry-coating method has limitations in terms of the amount of active material, long cycling stability, and good contact with the current collector, which seriously affect the electrochemical performance. Alternatively, the direct growth active materials on Ni foam, Cu foil, carbon cloth and other current collectors to build self-supported electrodes not only is conducive to enhancing the contact area between the electrode and active materials and cycle stability, but also increases the loading quantity of active materials.24,42,43
The above-mentioned methods have unique advantages, and thus the preparation methods can be flexibly selected according to the types and properties of the target metal selenides to expand their application in EES systems. The hydro-/solvothermal and thermal annealing methods can generally be applied in the synthesis of various architecture. The templating method can be widely used for the synthesis of 0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D materials. For example, 0D nanoparticles can be used as templates to synthesize 0D core–shell nanostructures; rod-like precursors or reactants can serve as templates for selenization in 1D structures; 2D nanomaterials can be used as templates to synthesize non-layered 2D nanomaterials; salt templates are often used to prepare porous materials with 3D structures; and MOFs as templates can react with selenium sources to form 3D polyhedral structures. The colloidal method can be used to obtain 0D monodisperse small nanoparticles or nanocrystals and 2D ultrathin nanolayers. The electrospinning method is suitable for 1D nanostructures. In addition, several approaches such as hydro-/solvothermal, thermal annealing, ion exchange, spray painting and electrospinning methods can be used to fabricate self-supported electrode materials. To present a systematic understanding, here, we briefly summarize the synthetic methods, applications, and electrochemical properties of metal selenides with different dimensions in Table 1.

4. Different dimensional metal selenide architectures in EES applications
In this section, the design and synthesis of various types of metal selenide nanoarchitectures ranging from 0D to 3D and self-supported nanoarchitectures are discussed. Specifically, we sequentially introduce 0D nanoarchitecture, 2D nanoarchitecture, assembled 3D nanoarchitecture, and self-supported electrodes of metal selenides in EES applications.
4.1 0D metal selenides
0D metal selenides generally consist of nanoparticles and quantum dots with a spherical morphology and dimensions less than 100 nm. Usually, the target products are obtained via the solvent-oriented effect in the hydro-/solvothermal process and thermally treating organic–inorganic hybrids or MOF precursors with selenium sources.47 These materials are widely used for EES applications due to their large solid–liquid contact area, abundant space for ion/electron transfer, stable mechanical stress, and high capacity contribution.9,10,26 Notably, the thermal annealing method can often integrate abundant heteroatom-doped carbon in 0D nanoparticles, thereby optimizing their electronic conductivity. For example, FeSe nanoparticles were prepared via a direct thermal annealing method, in which N-doped carbon layers were simultaneously introduced.46 A schematic illustration of the fabrication route for enhancing the Na+ storage ability is displayed in Fig. 2a. These small particles with an N-doped carbon layer (shown in Fig. 2b and c) facilitated ultra-long cycling and high-rate performance. Specifically, the reduction in particle size enhanced the connection area between the electrolyte and electrode, thus promoting the interfacial ion transport, while nitrogen-doped carbon not only effectively inhibited the aggregation of the FeSe particles but also accelerated the electron transfer. A similar method was employed to prepare binary metal selenides. Hou et al.47 prepared N-doped dual carbon (NDDC)-encapsulated Ni1.8Co1.2Se4 (NCS) nanoparticles (NCS@NDDC) via selenization and carbonation treatment of a bi-metal organic framework (Ni3[Co(CN)6]2·H2O) template. As an anode material for SIBs, the rate capacity of NCS@NDDC could reach 211 and 153 mA h g−1 at high current densities of 30 and 50 A g−1, respectively. The cycling capacity was maintained at 379.5 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 after 100 cycles. The excellent rate and cycling performance of NCS@NDDC are attributed to its unique structure. As shown in Fig. 2d and e, the abundant voids between the NCS particles and NDDC ensured sufficient space for volume changes during the de-/sodiation process. Additionally, NDDC facilitated short and ultrafast sodium ion and electron transfer. Besides, as seen in Fig. 2f, after 50 cycles in the fully charge stated, the outermost shell made the whole structure stable, although the innermost shell of the electrode material was broken. In addition, Zeng et al.40 fabricated porous hollow carbon-confined few-layer MoSe2 and ZnSe nanoparticles by annealing the organic–inorganic precursor containing zinc salt, molybdenum salt, and carbon source. When used as the anode material for LIBs and SIBs, both the reversible capacity and rate capacity were excellent. Notably, ZnSe/MoSe2@C manifested a remarkably long cycling performance at a high current density. It maintained a capacity of 524 mA h g−1 at 4 A g−1 after 600 cycles for LIBs and 381 mA h g−1 at 4 A g−1 after 250 cycles with a slight capacity degradation for SIBs. The excellent performance is mainly due to the following reasons. On the one hand, the porous structure with large void relieves the volume changes and enhances the kinetic reaction. On the other hand, in the porous carbon matrix, the confinement of a few layers of MoSe2 around ZnSe nanoparticles is conducive for the effective penetration of the electrolyte and rapid multi-electron transfer process. In addition to the above-mentioned 0D nanocomposites, ultrasmall-sized freestanding 0D nanoparticles are also commonly used in EES, which are usually obtained via colloidal and exfoliation methods. Zhao et al.10 prepared ultrasmall FeSe2 nanoparticles via a colloidal method and used them as an anode for SIBs. The FeSe2 nanoparticles exhibited long-term cycling stability of 450 mA h g−1 at 0.8 A g−1 over 300 cycles, high specific capacity of around 500 mA h g−1, and 250 mA h g−1 rate capacity at 10 A g−1. The ultrasmall particle size is favorable for increasing the surface area, shortening the ionic diffusion length, and ameliorating the mechanical stress. Similarly, based on the colloidal method, some strategies, e.g., yolk–shell structural design or composition adjustment on monodisperse ultrasmall nanoparticles, were engineered for capacity enhancement.40,49 For instance, Lou et al.49 fabricated Cu9Sn2Se9 (CTSe) nanoparticles via ligand exchange during the colloidal synthetic process. The ligand exchange process and morphology of the CTSe nanoparticles after the ligand exchange process are shown in Fig. 2g and h, respectively. CTSe showed a high capacity of 979.8 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 100 cycles, which is much higher than that of Cu, Sn-based anode materials in LIBs. This excellent performance is closely associated with the monodispersed ultrasmall nanoparticles, which are beneficial to alleviate the mechanical stress caused by volume changes. Besides, the colloidal quantum dot ligand exchange with mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) provides higher electronic connectivity. Besides the above-mentioned methods, the exfoliation and one-pot methods can also be used for the synthesis of metal selenide nanoparticles, such as SnSe QDs,50 α-FeSe nanoparticles,51 and CoSex-rGO nanoparticles.52

4.2 1D metal selenides
The 1D architecture is considered an ideal candidate for alleviating volume changes. This unique structure is beneficial for ion/electron transfer along the 1D direction.140 The templating method is the most commonly used method for the preparation of 1D metal selenides, with MOFs or Se nanowires as the self-template27,61 and SBA-15 as the hard template.63 For instance, Yang and coworkers synthesized Ni0.85Se/C hollow nanowires via a self-template hydrothermal method, in which the Se/C nanowires served as a template (Fig. 3a). As shown in the schematic diagram in Fig. 3b, this unique 1D porous hollow nanowire structure not only can provide a robust cushion to accommodate the volume changes in the sodium storage process, but also optimize the conductivity, diffusion length, and surface area of the electrode material. The morphologies of the Se/C template and Ni0.85Se/C product are shown in Fig. 3c and d, respectively. Compared with the morphology of nanoparticles, the Ni0.85Se/C hollow nanowires presented an excellent rate and cycling stability for SIBs. Specifically, the reversible capacity was maintained at ca. 390 mA h g−1 at 0.2C (1C = 416 mA g−1) after 100 cycles with 97% retention, and the rate capacity was 219 mA h g−1 at the high rate of 5C (Fig. 3e and f). In addition, based on the advantages of the 1D structure, the introduction of defects can further enhance the EES performance. Cai et al.57 fabricated a defect-rich MoS2(1−x)Se2x nanowire structure via the hydrothermal method with an MoO3 nanowire template. The tuning of the sulfur-selenium ratio could further improve the electronic conductivity of the nanowire structure, thereby significantly enhancing its electrochemical performance. Specifically, the reversible capacity reached 500 mA h g−1 at a high-rate density of 5C after 350 cycles. Notably, the in situ visualization of the structural evolution of metal selenide nanowire structures during the charge–discharge cycles is of great instructive significance for the in-depth understanding of the capacity fading mechanism of alkaline ion batteries. Li et al.56 studied the nanopore evolution process of prototype Sb2Se3 nanowires via in situ TEM analysis. The results showed that the significant volume shrinkage after Na+ extraction led to the formation of abundant pores in the materials, and finally complete pulverization. To suppress the formation of pores, the authors controlled the charging cut-off voltage to prevent the conversion reaction, thus maintaining the integrity of the electrode structure and significantly improving the cycle performance of the battery.

The templating method is also an effective strategy for the synthesis of nanorod structures in metal selenides. Ge et al.62 designed rod-like FeSe2/N–C with a controllable size and morphology using Prussian blue for SIBs. By virtue of the abundant cyano groups, Fe–N–C bonds were formed and coated on FeSe2 uniformly after thermal treatment. The carbon layer facilitated an enhancement in conductivity, promoted the ion transfer, and cushioned the volume expansion. Interestingly, the particle size could be adjusted by changing the heating rate. A slow heating rate resulted in a smaller particle size, which is beneficial to electrolyte infiltration and provides more active sites with a wider energy level. Moreover, in situ and ex situ technologies were applied to study the morphology and composition evolution, which demonstrated the unique structural stability. It is amazing that the reversible capacity was maintained at 308 mA h g−1 at the high current density of 10 A g−1 after 10000 cycles. Park et al.61 also adopted a templating method to prepare FeSe2/GC rods. They used iron-based MOF (MIL-88) as the precursor and template. During the heat treatment, hollow voids were formed in the carbon framework via Kirkendall diffusion, which effectively alleviated the volume changes, provided more active sites and ensured high conductivity and structural durability. Besides, mixed-metal selenides with a rod-like structure were also designed. Sun et al.60 used a bimetal-organic-framework as the template to synthesize Co–Zn–Se@C rods. The Co–Zn–Se@C materials used in LIBs showed a superior capacity of 949 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 500 cycles. This high lithium-ion storage was attributed to both the MOF-derived porous rod structure and the synergistic effect of the two active components.
Electrospinning is a common method used for the preparation of 1D nanofibers of metal selenides by virtue of its easy operation and control. This process requires the initial materials to be dissolved in the selected solution or even dispersed. Metal selenide nanofibers have attracted extensive interest in energy-relevant fields because of their structural stability. To facilitate the electrochemical performance and maintain their structural strength, organic solvents or solutes are added to the precursor solution, which can be transformed into carbon layers after the carbonation process. For instance, Cho et al.35 introduced NiSe2-rGO-C porous nanofibers as an anode for SIBs via electrospinning. The relevant electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests suggested the structural stability of NiSe2-rGO-C porous nanofibers and the cycling capacity retention could be kept at 65% (calculated with discharge capacity) at 0.2 A g−1 after 100 cycles, which was much higher than that of the comparative sample. The authors also synthesized MoSe2–C nanofibers using similar methods and investigated the performance of SIBs.58 The detailed formation process is displayed in Fig. 4a. It can be observed that polystyrene nanobeads were firstly introduced in solution to control the void size precisely. Fig. 4b–d show that after thermal treatment, the voids were distributed uniformly, which could alleviate the volume changes and facilitate the ion transfer and electrolyte penetration. Moreover, the carbon layer derived from the carbonation of PVP along the 1D nanostructure ensures high electrical conductivity. Benefiting from these advantages, as shown in Fig. 4e, the MoSe2–C nanofibers displayed a high discharge capacity of 454 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 over 200 cycles with a coulombic efficiency of 98.4%. Yin et al.38 synthesized CoSe2/CNFs via the electrospinning technique for flexible SIBs. The interlinked carbon fibers serve as a conductive substrate for rapid Na+ diffusion rapidly and volume accommodation during (de)sodiation. Moreover, the carbon fiber network could limit the aggregation of the CoSe2 grains, which ensured long cycling stability. Kang's group also used a similar method to prepare multi-component metal selenide nanofibers, which exhibited excellent sodium storage performance.59 Besides their application in SIBs, nanofiber structures also exhibit stability in PIBs and SCs. Shen et al.37 encapsulated MoSe2/C fibers, which were used for both PIBs and nonaqueous battery-SC hybrid devices (BSH). The relevant cyclic voltammetry (CV) and EIS tests proved the rapid ion/electron transfer kinetics of the MoSe2/C fibers. The comparative images of before and after cycling showed the structural stability of the MoSe2/C fibers. The rapid ion/electron transfer was derived from the large layer space of the metal selenide and the structural stability was maintained by the carbon nanofibers. Therefore, the MoSe2/C fibers displayed a high capacity of 316 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 100 cycles in PIBs and showed a specific capacity of 81 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 100 cycles in a BSH device. Lv et al.36 designed Co–Zn–Se@CNT-CNF hierarchical tube-on-fiber nanostructures by electrospinning a Co–Zn hybrid ZIF with polyacrylonitrile (PAN), and the corresponding process and characteristics of the tube-on-fiber are shown in Fig. 5a–d. As shown in Fig. 5f and g, Co–Zn–Se@CNT-CNF exhibited an impressive specific capacity of 1040.1 C g−1 (1891 F g−1) at 1 A g−1 and excellent cycling performance of 88.6% capacity retention after 8000 cycles at a high rate of 5 A g−1. The superior behavior in SCs is mainly attributed to the following points. Firstly, the mixed metal selenides provide more faradaic reactions (Fig. 5e). Secondly, the tube-on-fiber architecture shortens the ion/electron transfer length, which facilitates a kinetic enhancement. Additionally, the interlinked fibers avoid the aggregation of the metal selenide particles, thus promoting their structural stability.

Compared with nanowires, nanorods, and nanofibers, nanotubes with a hollow feature not only offer large active surface areas for better transfer but also enhance the connectivity and maintain the structural stability, resulting in a better energy performance. Metal selenide nanotubes are often prepared via the template-assisted method combined with thermal annealing and solvothermal methods. For the template-assisted method, Yi et al.65 reported the preparation of conversion-alloying-type hollow Sb2Se3@C microtubes by thermally treating an Sb2O3 template (Fig. 6a). The detailed morphology information is shown in Fig. 6b–d. On account of the large volume changes in conversion-alloying-type materials for batteries, the hollow structure provides more space for charge transfer and effectively moderates the volume changes. Besides, the 1D architecture prevents self-agglomeration and improves the charge transfer. The outer carbon layer also enhances the mechanical durability. Thus, the Sb2Se3@C microtubes used for PIBs showed a better capacity of 312.8 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 40 cycles and higher cycling stability of 191.4 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1 even after 400 cycles. As shown in Fig. 6e and f, the comparison of the SEM images before and after cycling between the Sb2Se3 microrods and Sb2Se3@C microtubes obviously demonstrated the structural stability of the Sb2Se3@C microtube electrode. Similar synthetic strategies were used by Gao and coworkers.55 The multicomponent MoSe2/C composite shell-encapsulated CoSe2 nanoparticles (CoSe2⊂MoSe2/C) used for LIBs and SIBs also verified the advantages of the tubular structure. On the one hand, the unique structure shortens the ion diffusion pathway originating from the tubular architecture and enhances the mechanical robustness derived from the carbon layer protection. On the other hand, the pseudocapacitive contribution greatly enhances the rate capacity with a high retention of 81.5% from 0.1 to 3 A g−1. For the solvothermal method, Luo et al.54 constructed Sn–C bonds in SnSe-CNT nanotubes to improve the lithium-ion storage performance. The CNTs effectively limited the aggregation of the SnSe nanoparticles and enhanced the conductivity of the electrode materials. Moreover, the strong bonds of Sn–C between SnSe and CNTs caused fast ion/electron transfer, which was beneficial for reversible conversion and improved the structural stability. Therefore, it showed a high reversible capacity of 772 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 after 200 cycles and maintained 323 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 over 1000 cycles. This hollow 1D structure is also suitable for use in SCs. Early 2013, Wang et al.64 prepared Co0.85Se nanotubes via the solvothermal method with Co(CO3)0.35Cl0.20(OH)1.10 nanorods as the template. Compared with the Co0.85Se nanoparticles, the nanotubes exhibited higher capacitive properties. The specific capacitance in a strong alkaline solution could reach 238 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 over 2000 cycles with a capacity retention of 90.3%.

4.3 2D metal selenides
The unique large surface area of 2D materials provides abundant active sites for electrochemical reactions and promotes closer contact with the electrolyte ions.9,73 Considering the need for ion and charge transport in EES, 2D materials are expected to play in important role in EES applications.43,141,142 In the case of 2D metal selenides, such as MoSe2, VSe2, and SnSe2, they have become increasingly attractive in the EES field by virtue of the general merits of 2D materials and the inherent electronic conductivity of Se-based materials.9,143 For instance, Kang's group prepared SnSe nanoplates via one-pot spray pyrolysis and used them as an anode for SIBs.71 By optimizing the content of SeO2, the discharge capacity could reach 558 mA h g−1 at 0.3 A g−1 after 50 cycles with 100% retention. Zhang et al.75 synthesized different morphologies of 2D SnSe via a one-pot chemical route and used them for SCs. The SnSe nanodisks and nanosheets showed specific capacitances of 168 F g−1 and 228 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, respectively. To enhance the EES performance, generally, many researchers ameliorate 2D structures with various approaches, such as coating with conductive materials,67,70,144 preparing monolayer or ultrathin structures,73,74,145 engineering multicomponent hybrids,32 and introducing heteroatoms.66,76 Specifically, 2D graphene is usually selected as a hybrid material to enhance the conductivity of electrode materials due to its high specific surface area and high conductivity. Considering the large volume changes derived from alloy reactions, it often serves as a cushion.146–148 Zhang et al.144 combined SnSe2 nanosheets with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) via the hydrothermal method and used them in SIBs. The detailed structure information is shown in Fig. 7a. Compared with the pure SnSe2 nanosheets, the SnSe2/rGO composite showed a better sodium-ion storage performance. The reversible capacity could be maintained at 515 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 100 cycles, while the pure SnSe2 nanosheets delivered only 152 mA h g−1. This improvement resulted from the layered structure of SnSe2 and the incorporation of rGO. The interlayer spacing can hold more sodium ions and rGO can enhance the conductivity and structural stability. Thoughtfully, density functional theory was used to illustrate the structure change during sodiation. Consequently, as shown in Fig. 7b and c, the lattice expansion could be reduced by 16.5% after the insertion of rGO. To achieve ultrafast gravimetric and volumetric sodium-ion storage, Li et al.70 prepared graphene-loaded Bi2Se3via the thermal annealing method. The synthetic process is displayed in Fig. 7d. Bi2Se3 underwent the conversion and alloying sodium-ion storage mechanism. Thus, a large volume expansion was inevitable. The C–O–Bi bond formation (verified by O 1s spectrum, as shown in Fig. 7e) between Bi2Se3 nanoparticles and graphene nanosheets provided strong interfacial interaction, which effectively prevented the exfoliation of Bi2Se3. Therefore, sustainable electron transfer could be supported. Besides, corresponding electrochemical tests showed that the capacitive contribution was dominant in the sodium ion storage process. Specifically, the Bi2Se3/graphene nanosheet (GNS) showed a high gravimetric capacity of 346 mA h g−1 and a volumetric capacity of 716 mA h cm−3 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. Surprisingly, it exhibited ultrafast sodium-ion storage with tiny capacity fading during the current density change process and ultra-stable cycling performance at a high density of 10 A g−1 over 1000 cycles. Kirubasankar et al.21 prepared NiSe in situ-grown on graphene (NiSe-G) via the hydrothermal method. As shown in Fig. 7f and i, NiSe was dispersed uniformly in the graphene nanosheets. The homogeneous distribution and strong interaction force of NiSe on the graphene nanosheets ensured faster charge transport and rich active sites for electrochemical reactions. Moreover, the graphene nanosheets prevented the accumulation of the NiSe nanoparticles, which ensured structural stability during the long cycling process. Thus, compared with the bare NiSe nanoparticles, the NiSe-G electrode displayed an excellent specific capacity of 1280 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and more stable cycling performance with 98% capacitance retention after 2500 cycles for application in SCs. The other carbon sources for coating metal selenides come from synthetic solvents or organic carbon sources. For instance, Zhou et al.68 used diethylenetriamine (DETA) and water as solvents to construct layered Co0.85Se nanosheets via 2D oriented attachment growth and solvothermal reaction. As shown in Fig. 7g, plate-like Co0.85Se nanocrystals were formed firstly, and then nanosheets were produced via attachment growth. Notably, DETA provided the carbon element in the Co0.85Se nanosheets and served as a stabilizer to prevent the aggregation of the preliminary nanocrystals. Additionally, the ratio of the precursors plays a key role in adjusting their growth orientation. As displayed in Fig. 7h, when the ratio of Co(Ac)2 and Na2SeO3 was 1:1, nanosheets with a uniform size and controlled compositions were obtained and exhibited higher lithium-ion storage performance. Ming et al.22 synthesized carbon-coated ultrathin VSe2 nanosheets via the solvothermal method. To improve their lithium and sodium ion storage performance, the ultrathin nanosheet morphology was designed under the stabilization effect of N-methyl pyrrolidone solvent.

For engineering monolayers or ultrathin nanosheets, ultrathin layered SnSe nanoplates were prepared via the colloidal method by Guo's group.73 Because of the weak van der Waals force, each ultrathin SnSe nanoplate stacked on the top of each other without aggregation. This unique structural characteristic accelerated the ion/electron transfer and buffered volume changes during the discharge/charge process. Thus, the SnSe nanoplates exhibited a high capacity of 463.6 mA h g−1 at 0.05 A g−1 for SIBs and 787.9 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 for LIBs after 300 cycles. Besides, Guo's group also used a similar method to synthesize metallic graphene-like VSe2 ultrathin nanosheets, which were used in PIBs.74 The graphene-like ultrathin morphology is displayed in Fig. 8a. The ultrathin structure provided a large contact area for the electrolyte/electrode and abundant active sites. Consequently, the graphene-like VSe2 ultrathin nanosheets exhibited an outstanding PIBs performance, in which the reversible capacity and the rate capacity reached 366 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and 169 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1 with 87.3% retention over 500 cycles, respectively. The ex-TEM image in Fig. 8b shows that the original morphology of the electrode materials after 500 cycles remained unchanged, which verified their structural stability. Moreover, the large adsorption energy and low diffusion barriers (Fig. 8c) derived from the first-principle calculations confirmed that the reaction kinetics were promoted. Besides the experimental method, theoretical calculations are often applied to estimate the potential of electrodes for energy applications. For instance, Zhou et al.145 used the first-principle calculation method to assess the possibility of using monolayer β-GeSe in SIBs and PIBs. The small energy barriers of Na+ (0.080 eV/0.125 eV) and K+ (0.052 eV/0.047 eV) on the Ge/Se side demonstrates the high rate performance. The small changes in lattice parameters during sodiation (3.34%) and potassiation (17.26%) indicate the structural stability.

Another strategy for optimizing the EES performance on nanosheets is introducing carbon materials, which have high electrical conductivity and chemical stability, but limited charge storage capability. For instance, Luo and coworkers designed few-layered MoSe2/rGO nanosheets via the solvothermal process.67 The synthetic process is displayed in Fig. 8d and the unique structure of few-layered MoSe2 loaded on rGO is shown in Fig. 8e. It is noteworthy that the MoSe2/rGO nanosheets used as an anode for LIBs achieved a remarkable cycling performance of 637 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 over 1000 cycles. This outstanding performance is ascribed to the nanosheet structure and high conductive material insertion. Specifically, the rGO nanosheets promoted the electrical conductivity, while few-layered MoSe2 nanosheets provided abundant active sites. In addition, the MoSe2/rGO nanosheets were composed of the above-mentioned two types of nanosheets, which provide a large surface area, thus decreasing the Li+ diffusion distance. This work combined ultrathin structural engineering with the incorporation of a high conductivity material and achieved good effects for the improvement in electrochemical performance. Thus, it provides another possible strategy for boosting the alkali-ion storage ability. SnSe nanoplates vertically grown on N-doped carbon (SnSe/NC) nanobelts were synthesized via the cation exchange method by Ren et al.76 As shown in Fig. 9a, the ZnSe/NC nanobelts were firstly prepared via the hydrothermal method combined with thermal annealing. Then, ZnSe/NC served as a template to obtain SnSe nanoplates through a cation exchange process under hydrothermal conditions. The corresponding SEM images of the precursor and final products are displayed in Fig. 9b–d. The strong interaction of the Sn–C bonds (verified in Fig. 9e and f) between the SnSe nanoplates and NC nanobelts ensured the structural stability and was beneficial for ion/electron transfer. Moreover, Fig. 9g shows the density functional theory calculations of a 0.1 eV Na+ diffusion barrier in the interlayer, suggesting that the N-doped carbon nanobelts facilitated Na+ diffusion. The presence of N heteroatoms plays a key role in the formation of Sn–C bonds. Consequently, the SnSe/NC nanobelt electrode presented a high capacity of 723 mA h g−1 at 25 mA g−1 after 50 cycles and stable cycling performance of 82% retention at 2 A g−1 after 200 cycles, which are much better than that of the pure SnSe nanobelts. Feng et al.66 employed a similar strategy to stabilize hexagonal prim MnSe. Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) served as nitrogen and carbon sources. By virtue of the function of N and C atoms, the MnSe/CN electrode used for LIBs exhibited a long cycling stability of 864.7 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 after 750 cycles. It is notable that they used the same method to construct N-doped carbon confined metal selenides, including ZnSe-CN, CoSe-CN, and NiSe-CN. These anode materials used for LIBs also showed an excellent cycling performance. Recently, Ma et al.39 designed 2D molybdenum dichalcogenide on an N-doped carbon (NC) heterostructure through a hard template and chemical vapor deposition method (CVD), which was used as an anode for PIBs. Among the samples, MoSe2-on-NC showed an excellent potassium ion storage in the low-cost KPF6 electrolyte. The capacity was maintained at 247 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 over 4800 cycles with 0.0093% capacity fading per cycle. This outstanding cycling performance is closely associated with the following aspects. Firstly, the introduction of N atoms is beneficial for enhancing the overall conductivity and potassium ion diffusion. Secondly, the formation of C–Mo and C–Se ensured structural stability during the repeated discharge/charge process. Additionally, the interfacial coupling between MoSe2 and carbon nanosheets enhanced the conductivity and K+ diffusion coefficient of the composite, thereby accelerating the reaction kinetics. Based on the above-mentioned facts, the N atom is a popular doping element in carbon-containing metal selenides to improve their alkali-ion storage performance, which suggests its universality.

Many researchers engineered nanosheet structures combined with designing multicomponent hybrids to promote the electrode performance. For instance, Fang et al.31 synthesized a CoSe2/ZnSe nanoflake heterostructure via the thermal annealing method. The formation of the heterostructure was verified by the obvious boundary, as shown in Fig. 10a. The redistribution of the phase boundary charge of CoSe2/ZnSe was confirmed by experimental and theoretical analysis. Detailed information on the phase boundary was obtained by X-ray absorption structure (XAS) measurements. As shown in Fig. 10b, the Co K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra showed that the absorption edge shifted to a higher energy in CoSe2/ZnSe compared with that in CoSe2, and meanwhile the white line in CoSe2/ZnSe decreased in comparison with that in ZnSe, implying that the valence of Zn decreased (Fig. 10c). Besides, Fig. 10d shows that the combination of the calculated density of states (DOS) of CoSe2 and ZnSe occurred for CoSe2/ZnSe due to the strong interfacial interaction. The charge density (Fig. 10e), planar averaged electrostatic potential and charge density difference (Fig. 10f) showed a strong electrostatic field, although the interface and electron transfer occurred from the CoSe2 side to ZnSe side. The electron accumulation on the ZnSe side was favorable for the adsorption of Na+. As shown in Fig. 10g, the Na+ adsorption energy of −2.74 eV is significantly lower than that of CoSe2 (−1.23 eV) and ZnSe (−0.28 eV). Thus, the heterostructure interface is conducive to the adsorption of sodium ions and fastens the reaction kinetics. Moreover, the multistep redox reaction process effectively relieved the volume changes derived from sodium ion insertion. Consequently, the CoSe2/ZnSe electrode showed a faster sodium diffusion and higher sodium-ion storage performance. The cycling capacity retention in a half cell was maintained at 83% and 84% at a high current density of 8 and 10 A g−1 over 4000 cycles, respectively. The reversible capacity in the full cell delivered 332 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1. The corresponding capacity retention reached 83% at 1 A g−1 over 800 cycles.

(f) Planar and macroscopic averaged electrostatic potential and (g) calculated Na+ adsorption energy.32 
In addition, ternary metal selenides have also received extensive attention. Tang et al.69 prepared SnSe0.5S0.5 nanoplates through the thermal annealing method, which showed an excellent discharge capacity of 1144 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 100 cycles, 682 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 over 200 cycles, and even 473 mA h g−1 at a high current density of 5 A g−1. When assembled with the Li(Ni0.6Co0.2Mn0.2)O2 cathode material, the full cell showed a high capacity of 1111 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. Based on the nanoplate structure to adapt the volume changes, the synergistic effect of Se and S was conducive to the expansion of the layer space and enhancement in conductivity. Besides, the stable conversion of SnSe and SnS ensured structural stability.
4.4 3D metal selenides
3D metal selenides are generally assembled by 0D, 1D, and 2D structures, showing various morphologies, such as polyhedrons, spheres, and hollow and hierarchical structures, and they not only possess the merits of their units, but also new advantages. For example, 3D structural materials provide a large area and enough space/porosity for the fast access of electrolytes/ions and prevent electrode materials from aggregating during the electrochemical reaction.9,18
To obtain 3D metal selenide polyhedrons, the common method employed is the selenization treatment of ZIF precursors or templates, such as ZIF-67, ZIF-8, and bimetal MOFs. For instance, Lou's group designed CoSe@C nanoboxes via the selenization of ZIF-67 nanocubes.97 The detailed formation process and the morphology are displayed in Fig. 11a and b, respectively. Because the hollow interior can alleviate volume variation and provide large void for charge transfer and the carbon layer prevents the structure from pulverizing, the CoSe@C electrode as an anode exhibited an excellent LIB performance in terms of specific capacity with high initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 78.3% at 0.2 A g−1, exceptional rate performance, and excellent long cycling retention. According to the above-mentioned statement, the 3D hollow polyhedron structure is beneficial to improve the alkali-ion storage performance because the unique structure provides abundant space for ion/electron transfer and ensures the structural stability during repeat cycling. As shown in Fig. 11c, Lou's group also synthesized hierarchical Cu-doped CoSe2 boxes using a two-step ion-exchange method and applied them in SIBs.116 The synthetic process involved two steps. The Co–Co Prussian blue analogue (PBA) cubes served as a template, and firstly, the anion exchange occurred between the Se2− ions and Co–Co PBA to form CoSe2 boxes, and then the cation exchange took place between the Cu2+ ions and CoSe2 boxes to obtain Cu-doped CoSe2 boxes (Fig. 11d). The EIS test, as shown in Fig. 11e, showed that Cu doping improved the electronic conductivity. The pseudocapacitive contribution in Fig. 11f is associated with the hollow boxed structure. Benefiting from the enhanced electronic conductivity (Fig. 11e) and the pseudocapacitance contributed by the hollow box structure (Fig. 11f), the Cu-doped CoSe2 exhibited a high capacity of 492 mA h g−1 at 0.05 A g−1, stable rate capacity of 185 mA h g−1 at 3 A g−1, and outstanding cycling stability with 94% capacity retention at 1 A g−1 after 500 cycles. Fan et al.18 synthesized 3D hierarchical hollow FeSe2@C nanocubes via the selenization of Prussian blue precursor and used them for SIBs. Compared with FeSe2 nanoflowers, the hierarchical hollow FeSe2@C nanocubes showed a higher cycling performance at 0.1 A g−1 with larger coulombic efficiency of 62.8% and ultra-long cycling stability over 3000 cycles at a high current density of 10 A g−1. The outstanding performance is associated with the hollow nanocube structure, which accommodates volume changes during (de)sodiation and decreases the Na+ transfer resistance. Zhang et al.28 also used ZIF-67 as a template to synthesize 3D porous CoSe/C dodecahedra through selenization at high temperatures. The preparation process and structural information are displayed in Fig. 12a. The yolk–shell mesoporous structure constructed by 0D nanoparticles facilitated electrolyte penetration and reduced the volume change stress. The carbon framework with nitrogen enhanced the electron conductivity and structural stability. Thus, the CoSe/C composites used as an anode for SIBs showed a high reversible capacity of 597.2 and 361.9 mA h g−1 at 0.2 and 16 A g−1, respectively. A similar electrode material of CoSe@porous carbon polyhedrons (CoSe@PCP) was synthesized via similar methods and used for both LIBs and SIBs. With the synergistic effect of nanosized CoSe and PCP, CoSe@PCP used in LIBs exhibited a high reversible capacity of 675 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 over 100 cycles and 708.2 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 over 500 cycles. Ma et al.86 also adopted ZIF-67 as a precursor to synthesize Co0.85Se@NC polyhedrons. Benefiting from the N-doped carbon and mesoporous characteristics, the electrode displayed a high potassium-ion storage performance, especially long cycling stability and rate capacity. Moreover, ZIF-8 as a zinc-based MOF is often used to prepare zinc selenide. Chen et al.7 selected ZIF-8 as a template to construct ZnSe nanodots in an N-doped porous carbon network via pyrolysis to form a ZnSe@C core–shell structure, which showed an outstanding lithium-ion storage performance. Their reversible capacity was 1134 mA h g−1 at 0.6 A g−1 over 500 cycles. Besides, He et al.108 prepared ZnSe nanoparticle@N-doped hollow carbon (NHC) polyhedron (ZnSe NP@NHC) by thermally treating the ZIF-8 precursor, which was used for SIBs and PIBs (Fig. 12b). In addition to the function of introduced N atom, the hollow carbon shell facilitated ion/electron diffusion, provided rich active sites, and buffered the volume changes during the electrochemical reaction.

Thus, the ZnSe NP@NHC electrode showed excellent long cycling stability, in which, the capacity was maintained at 132.9 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 1200 cycles for PIBs and 250.8 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 1300 cycles with a high initial Coulomb efficiency (ICE) of 99% for SIBs. When combined with a Prussian blue cathode to construct a sodium ion full cell, the cycling stability was maintained for 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1. In addition, by comparing the TEM images before and after the cycling process, it was found that the structure of ZnSe NP@NHC still maintained its initial shape (Fig. 12c and d), respectively. Besides, Zhang et al.114 fabricated CoSe2/C double-shell dodecahedra through the sacrificial template of MOFs, which were used for SCs. They showed a long cycling capacity stability of 618 F g−1 at 5 A g−1 over 2000 cycles, which is associated with the double-shell hollow structure and the carbon framework with nitrogen derived from MOFs. Other metal selenide polyhedrons, e.g., Ni1.5CoSe5@NC@rGO,102 Ni0.67Fe0.33Se2,107 NiSe2,85 and Co/(NiCo)Se2,118 also presented a high EES performance. The 3D porous spherical structures also provide large voids for cushioning volume changes, preventing the agglomeration of the materials and facilitating the kinetic process. Recently, as shown in Fig. 13a, yolk–shell CuCo2Se4 (YS-CCS) spheres were synthesized via the hydrothermal method and used for SCs in alkaline media.79 The yolk–shell structure is displayed in Fig. 13b, which not only provided a high surface area, but also reduced the ion diffusion length. Combined with the incorporated components, it showed an excellent specific capacitance of 512 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and maintained high cycling stability of 83.7% retention after 6000 cycles. Moreover, YS-CCS was assembled with active carbon to form an asymmetric SC (ASC). This device also showed a high rate of 84.67% and capacity retention of 88% after 6000 cycles. The introduction of low volume change materials is also an effective way to ameliorate the huge volume changes. For instance, Hu et al.95 synthesized core–shell (nano-SnSe/nano-Li4Ti5O12)@C {(n-SnSe/n-LTO)@C} spheres via a thermal annealing method, which were used in LIBs, showing both high structural stability and cycling performance. As shown in Fig. 13c and d, the core–shell structure was well retained after 500 cycles at a high current density of 1.0 A g−1. This superior long cycling performance is closely related to two factors. On the one hand, the core–shell structure provides large voids for cushioning the volume changes and enhancing the ion transport and electrolyte infiltration. On the other hand, Li4Ti5O12 serves as a dispersant to relieve the aggregation. This dispersant has the merits of structural stability, small volume changes during electrochemical reactions and fast ion diffusion. Thus, these two factors cooperate to enhance the lithium-ion storage performance of SnSe. The nanoparticle-assembled 3D porous spherical structure has large voids and rich pores, which are beneficial for the improvement of the reaction kinetics, a partial increase in pseudocapacitance, and full infiltration of the electrolyte in the electrode. Ali et al.80 designed nanoparticle-assembled 3D CoSe@CS spherical structures through the Ostwald ripening process in a mixed solution of glycerol and isopropanol (Fig. 14a). Carbon spheres were used as a support on nanosized CoSe, which not only provided more conductive channels for ion/electron transport but also provided necessary space for volume changes to ensure the electrode structural stability (Fig. 14b–d). Thus, the long cycling performance for SIBs was boosted, and specifically, the capacity was maintained at 350 mA h g−1 at a rate of 1 A g−1 after 4000 cycles and 260 mA h g−1 at a high rate of 4 A g−1 even after 10000 cycles. Afterward, they used similar raw materials to prepare 3D binary-metal selenides via the hydrothermal method combined with the thermal annealing process.92 The detailed morphology information is shown in Fig. 14e–g, in which the Fe2CoSe4 nanoparticles were also supported by a carbon matrix to form a 3D spherical structure. The as-prepared Fe2CoSe4 spheres were used as anode materials for SIBs and exhibited an excellent rate performance of 816.3 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and extended cycling life of 350 mA h g−1 after 5000 cycles at 4 A g−1. This extraordinary electrochemical performance resulted from the hierarchically porous sphere structure and enhancement in conductivity caused by the incorporation of metal elements.

The 3D hollow structure can be regarded as a potential electric material architecture for EES due to its peculiar characteristics. The relevant reports suggest that the unique structure decreases the transport distance of both charge and mass and enhances the mechanical strain.9,149–151 This structure is also popular in metal selenide electrode materials. Besides the above-mentioned 3D polyhedral hollow structures prepared via the MOF template method, the thermal annealing and hydro-/solvothermal methods are also common methods to prepare this unique structure. During this process, the Kirkendall effect and Ostwald ripening process play key roles in the synthesis of hollow structures. As shown in Fig. 15a, Ge et al.91 synthesized NiSe2/N–C 3D hollow spheres via the thermal annealing method. Ni-Pr-PPy spheres were prepared via the self-assembly process and in situ polymerization. During the high-temperature annealing process, the hollow formation of NiSe2/N–C was derived from the Kirkendall effect. Essentially, the relative movements of different ions were employed. Fig. 15b and c show that the hollow sphere structure remained stable after cycling. This stable hollow architecture and Ni–O–C bonds formed in carbonization greatly improved many aspects in terms of volume change alleviation, fast ion transfer and trapping of poly-selenide effectively. Thus, it delivered a long and stable capacity of 374 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1 after 3000 cycles for SIBs. Similarly, the Kirkendall effect was also used to engineer other hollow structures. For instance, Choi et al.26 prepared H-FeSe2/GC spheres via the salt-template method, which were used as an anode for SIBs. The hollow cavities and porous carbon effectively buffered large volume variations. Consequently, the discharge capacity was maintained at 510 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 and the capacity retention reached 88%. In our previous work,78 a new strategy of Hansen solubility parameter (HSP)-guided solvent selection to initiate Ostwald ripening was proposed to design 3D hollow MoSe2 (3D MoSe2 HSs). Clearly, within a period of 12 to 36 h, the yolk dissolved gradually, and finally completely disappeared after 48 h, leading to 3D MoSe2 HSs (Fig. 15d and e). Moreover, the resultant 3D MoSe2 HSs exhibited an architecture-dependent electrochemical performance towards the hydrogen evolution reaction and SIBs.

The 3D hierarchical structure constructed by nanosheets can usually effectively alleviate the aggregation and stacking of 2D structures. Li et al.81 designed a tremella-like CoSe-rGO hybrid via the solvothermal method for use in LIBs and SIBs. Its unique morphology is displayed in Fig. 16a and b. The C–Se bonds formed in CoSe-rGO were verified by XPS spectra and Raman spectra, as shown in Fig. 16c and d, respectively. The strong C–Se bonds in CoSe-rGO were favorable for increasing the structural strength and suppressing the dissolution of Se. The transmission X-ray microscopy analysis between CoSe and CoSe-rGO in Fig. 16e verified these functions. After 100 cycles, Se-rich and Co-rich regions were obvious in CoSe, while CoSe-rGO maintained a homogenous morphology. Besides, the hierarchically porous characteristic was maintained, which ensured fast ion/electron transfer. Lin et al.98 synthesized cubic-phase CuSe assembled by nanosheets in solution, which was applied in both SIBs and PIBs. The CuSe used as an anode exhibited long cycling stability of 295 mA h g−1 at a high current density of 10 A g−1 after 1200 cycles for SIBs and 280 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1 after 340 cycles with superior capacity retention of around 100%. It was remarkable that the ICE values of the SIBs and PIBs were 91.0% and 92.4%, respectively, which are rarely high in metal selenides used for SIBs and PIBs. This excellent performance is attributed to the following aspects. Firstly, the physicochemical properties of the cubic phase are different from the usual hexagonal phase. Secondly, the unique structure composed of nanosheets facilitates a reduction in the diffusion distance, increase in active sites and conductivity, and rate performance enhancement dominated by pseudo-capacitance. Finally, the type of electrolyte affects the promotion of the PIB performance. When this hierarchical characteristic material is applied to SCs, an excellent performance can also be achieved. For instance, Peng et al.90 prepared petal-like Co0.85Se nanosheets through the solvothermal method. The ASCs consisted of positive petal-like Co0.85Se and negative nitrogen-doped porous carbon networks. By virtue of their unique structure, they provided a large surface area, power density of 400 W kg−1 and super cycling stability with 93.8% capacity retention over 5000 cycles in 2 M KOH solution. Besides the above-mentioned metal selenides, other hierarchical metal selenides, e.g., tin selenide,82,87,119 molybdenum selenide,104 bismuth selenide,110 ion-doped metal selenide,88,89,117 bimetal selenide,112,115,120 and multicomponent metal selenides,77 can also be designed to enhance the EES performance. In addition, other types of 3D metal selenide structures (e.g., ZnSe spheres/MWCNTs,83 CoSe2@C spheres,17 CoFe2Se4–CoNiSe2,84 rGO@MCSe,99 3D porous FeSe2,100 necklace-like CNT-CoSe2@NC,113 CoSe2@N-PGC/CNTs,111 Mn–Fe–Se/CNTs,101 and 3D SnSe/SnO2@Gr heterostructure103) have also been studied for EES.

4.5 Self-supported metal selenide electrodes
To prepare electrodes, the conventional method is to coat active materials on metal foils. In this process, the additives and binders exert a negative impact on the electrolyte permeation and utilization of the active materials. Alternatively, numerous reports have verified that self-supported electrodes are advantageous for improving the performance of electrodes.152–154 Self-supported electrodes exhibit the merits of increasing the specific surface area between the electrolyte and electrodes, enhancing the electrode conductivity, buffering volume changes, preventing agglomeration, and promoting the loading quantity of active materials. Usually, the substrates used for self-supported metal selenides contain carbon fiber cloth (CFC), Ni foam, carbon-based sponge, aerosol, etc.25,41,127,138,155 The solvothermal and thermal annealing methods are common synthetic methods. Besides, spray painting, electrospinning, electrodeposition, CVD, and ion exchange can also be used.
In the case of CFC used as a substrate on metal selenides, Xie et al.42 used CFC to design sandwiched vertical graphene (VG)–MoSe2 nanosheet-N-doped carbon (VG/MoSe2/N–C) electrode materials via hydrothermal and polymerization method. A schematic illustration of the synthesis is shown in Fig. 17a. Initially, VG was formed on the CFC substrate, and then MoSe2 nanosheets were grown on VG through the hydrothermal process, and finally the core/shell VG/MoSe2/N–C was produced via the polymerization of dopamine hydrochloride. The corresponding morphologies are shown in Fig. 17b–d. The electrode displayed a high rate capacity of 538 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1, 300 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1, and 530 mA h g−1 at the reversed 0.2 A g−1 as well as long cycling stability of 298 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1 over 1000 cycles (Fig. 17e and f). This superior sodium-ion storage performance is dependent on the electrode structure. On the one hand, the double conductive layers of VG and NC led to fast ion/electron transfer and suppressed the agglomeration of the MoSe2 nanosheets. On the other hand, the self-supported structure with rich pores ensured close contact between the electrolyte and active materials. Deepalakshmi et al.121 also used CFC to fabricate ternary metal selenides via the solvothermal method, which were used for SCs. As shown in Fig. 18a, the bimetal layered double hydroxide (LDH) was formed through the hydrothermal process, and then Sn0.33Ni0.67Se2 was obtained after selenization. The morphology of the nanosheets on CFC is shown in Fig. 18b. By virtue of the introduction of Sn and the stable hierarchical free-standing architecture, Sn0.33Ni0.67Se2 showed a high specific capacity of 346 mA h g−1 at a current density of 1.0 mA cm−2 (Fig. 18c). The flexible SCs assembled using Sn0.33Ni0.67Se2 and Fe2O3@NG exhibited a high energy density and high-power density (Fig. 18d). This study provides a new direction for fabricating ternary metal selenides to enhance the EES performance. Similarly, to improve the energy density of flexible SCs, both positive electrode NiVSe4 and negative NiFe2Se4 were also fabricated on CFC through the selenization of bimetal LDH precursors.134 The presence of Ni and CFC support resulted in an outstanding energy density of 73.5 W h kg−1 at 0.733 kW kg−1 and excellent cycling stability of 96.6% retention over 10000 galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) cycles in the NiV2Se4//NiFe2Se4 ASC, as shown in Fig. 18e and f. Other ternary metal selenides grown on CFC used for EES were also investigated, such as (Ni,Co)0.85Se/CFC,124 Mn0.33Fe0.67Se2/CFC,43 and CoMoSe4@C.132 Besides the solvothermal method, the spray painting method can also be used for the preparation of self-supported electrodes. For instance, Wang et al. used this method to obtain SnSe/CF and investigated its lithium-ion storage and SC performance.135

In the case of Ni foam applied as a substrate for metal selenides, Du et al.156 prepared honeycomb-like Ni0.85Se nanosheets arrayed on Ni foam via the hydrothermal method for SCs. This unique structure with porosity, hydrophilicity, and metallicity not only offered a large surface area, shorter ion diffusion distance and prevented agglomeration but also ensured a high mass loading. Thus, Ni0.85Se exhibited an excellent capacitance with high stability and outstanding performance in ASCs. To improve the electroconductivity of all the electrode materials, it is effective to coat carbon-based materials combined with the fabrication of self-supported structures. For instance, Huang's group synthesized net-like MoSe2-acetylene black supported on Ni foam (MoSe2-AB/Ni) via a hydrothermal strategy.41 The detailed information on its morphology is shown in Fig. 19a and b. MoSe2-AB/Ni was used in SCs, exhibiting high stability of 107.5% with the capacity of 2020 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. This excellent performance is attributed to the conductivity enhancement, which resulted from the incorporation of AB and decrease in ion diffusion distance derived from the unique porous structure based on the Ni substrate. Recently, Liu et al.137 synthesized MoSe2 nanoflakes grown on a vertically aligned carbon nanotube array film (VACNTF) with Ni foam support. As shown in Fig. 19c and d, VACNTF with channels facilitated ion transfer, cushioned the volume change and improved the conductivity. Thus, it showed high cycling stability of 435 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with 92% retention over 5000 cycles. Besides single metal selenides, many ternary or multi-component metal selenides were also engineered, such as nest-like NiS@NiSe2,137 (Co, Mn)-NiSe2-dien/NF,122 Co–Cd–Se/NF,123 NiCo2.1Se3.3 NSs/3DG/NF,125 Cu0.5Co0.5Se2,128 FexCo3−xSe4.129 Specifically, Lee's and Kim's groups128 used a similar solvothermal method to fabricate ternary Cu0.5Co0.5Se2 and FexCo3−xSe4 nanosheets on Ni foam, which were used in SCs, respectively. The similar fabrication process is displayed in Fig. 19e. Taking advantage of the composition change and hierarchical porous structure stabilized by Ni foam, Cu0.5Co0.5Se2 resulted in the ultrahigh specific capacity of 1695 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and cycling stability of 94.9% retention over 10000 cycles at 15 A g−1, respectively (Fig. 19g and h). Moreover, Cu0.5Co0.5Se2 combined with the negative MXene electrode to form an ASC (Fig. 19f), which delivered a high energy density of 84.17 W h kg−1 at 0.604 kW kg−1 (Fig. 19i). FexCo3−xSe4 showed a superior specific capacity of 398.5 mA h g−1 at 1 mA cm−2, ultrahigh energy density of 84.1 W h kg−1 at 0.69 kW kg−1 and excellent cycling stability of 94.5% retention at 50 mA cm−2 over 10000 cycles with the Fe2O3@NG negative electrode. Other metal selenides grown on substrates, e.g., Cu2−xSe-CuO on Cu foil,133 Cu2Se-CTAB on Cu foil,138 Cu–Co selenide nanowires on WCF,157 and Co0.85Se@CoNi2S4 on graphene foam,136 have also attracted attention in the EES field.

Besides the above-mentioned materials, carbon-based sponges and aerosols have also been used as substrates to construct sub-supported electrodes. For instance, Yousaf et al.24 coated MoSe2 on carbon nanotube (CNT) sponge to form 3D nanotubular sponge via the solvothermal method. By virtue of the 3D porous network structure, which provided a high surface and high conductivity, buffered huge volume changes and inhibited the agglomeration of MoSe2, CNT@MoSe2 in an LIB delivered a high discharge capacity of 820.5 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 100 cycles. Zhang et al.127 decorated MoSe2–CoSe2 with an N-doped graphene aerogel (MoSe2–CoSe2/NGA) via the hydrothermal method. Because the porous NGA ensured ion diffusion, structural stability, and high conductivity, MoSe2–CoSe2/NGA in an LIB exhibited a high discharge capacity of 914 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 over 200 cycles.
5. Conclusions and prospects
In conclusion, we summarized the relevant reports on various the nanostructural advantages of metal selenides in EES systems, including LIBs, SIBs, PIBs, and SCs. The rational design of nanomaterials with different dimensions is beneficial for improving the electrochemical performance of materials. Firstly, nanosized materials can provide a high specific surface area, which enhances the contact area between the electrolyte and electrode, increases the reactive sites, and changes their properties in terms of thermology, electricity, and optics. Secondly, the unique geometric structure facilitates fast ion/electron diffusion and provides abundant active sites. The high theoretical capacity, good electric conductivity, and rich element resources of metal selenides make them promising for EES. Thirdly, different dimensional structures (0D, 1D, 2D, 3D, and self-supported electrode) have their own merits in EES systems, such as increasing the specific area, providing adequate channels, buffering volume changes, and enhancing the mechanical stability. Specifically, the metal selenides used for alkali ion batteries and SCs need a large specific surface area to ensure good contact between the electrode and electrolyte and enough voids to alleviate volume changes and enable ion/electron transfer. Therefore, the advantages of different nanostructures provide a solution for the design of current collector-free, high-energy, high-power, long-lasting, next-generation energy storage devices. Besides, the strategies of carbon coating, heteroatoms doping, heterostructure engineering, and multicomponent design can further improve the performance of EES devices based on different architectures.
Although excellent performances by means of the advantages of various structures have been achieved, there are still many challenges in the application of nanostructured metal selenides in the field of EES. Thus far, with the exception of multi-walled carbon nanotube additives in LIB electrodes and carbon coatings on silicon particles, the application of nanomaterials in actual commercial devices is limited. Therefore, for the practical application of nanostructured metal selenides, great efforts are still needed, including further optimizing nanomaterial-based electrode structures, developing large-scale synthesis methods, revealing multi-component synergistic mechanisms, and exploring electrode fabrication schemes.
(1) Nanostructured metal selenides have a high specific surface area, which can lead to irreversible parasitic reactions with the electrolyte in alkali metal-ion batteries, resulting in a low coulombic efficiency, low cycle life, low energy density, and low safety. Accordingly, to realize their practical application, constructing microscale secondary particles may be an effective strategy, which is beneficial to reduce the specific SEI area formed between the electrolyte and electrode. For example, Cui et al. effectively tuned the specific surface area of the electrode/electrolyte by designing a silicon anode with a pomegranate-like nanostructure (Fig. 20a).158

(2) Toxic solvents such as hydrazine hydrate are often used in the solvothermal method and harmful gas such as H2Se is produced during the thermal annealing process. This is detrimental for the preparation of metal selenides on a large scale due to the environmental risk to a certain extent. Therefore, green and healthy synthetic methods need to be urgently developed for their large-scale production.
(3) Soluble polyselenide intermediates are readily produced in conversion-type selenide anodes. Although selenium is unstable in some electrolytes, it can produce significant side effects, which significantly degrade the EES performance of metal selenides. Further tuning the geometric and electronic structures of metal selenides to improve their reversible reactivity and developing ideal electrolytes to ease the dissolution of polyselenides may be effective strategies to suppress their electrochemical performance degradation.
(4) The metal selenide-based multicomponent functional mechanism in alkali ion batteries is not fully understood. Thus, combining in situ electrochemical experiments and theoretical simulation calculations to monitor the ion storage process will contribute to a deeper understanding of the detailed mechanism of multicomponent cooperation effects.
(5) For the actual application of nanostructured metal selenides, some methods need to be adopted to build nanostructured metal selenide-based batteries and supercapacitor devices. Considering that nanomaterials have the advantage of enabling the fabrication of electrodes of any size and shape, bendable, compressible, foldable, and stretchable devices can be constructed. However, the design and implementation of these devices require the incorporation of nanomaterials in functional structures. One option is to disperse functionalized metal selenide nanoparticles uniformly in a solvent to configure a slurry, and then using the spraying technique to fabricate nanomaterials into flexible energy storage devices (Fig. 20b).159 In addition, to further increase the surface energy density and capacitance or capacity of devices, the thickness and level of the electrodes need to be increased to construct a 3D device. Therefore, with the help of 3D printing technology and adapting the composite nanostructure composition to the specific situation (Fig. 20b), for example, the ratio of 0D particles to 2D flakes can be increased for easier printing, the desired mechanical strength and conductivity of 3D energy storage devices can be achieved.159
Although fundamental material guidelines for designing nanostructured metal selenides to improve their electrochemical performances have been established, the commercial applications of nanostructured metal selenides are still limited by their high cost due to their complex synthesis procedures and expensive raw materials. Thus, it is crucial to explore facile routes for the large-scale synthesis of nanomaterials at low cost.
