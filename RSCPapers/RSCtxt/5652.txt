    , Accepted 16th August 2019First published on 16th August 2019AbstractThe field of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) has seen rapid development in the past few years, particularly, with reports on the use of a high performance nonfullerene electron acceptor (named Y6) in binary devices. In this paper, we demonstrate a simple yet effective ternary approach that can simultaneously increase the open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current-density, and fill factor of a binary device based on Y6 and a donor polymer named PM6. By adding a small amount of PCBM into the PM6:Y6 system, we achieved a high efficiency of 16.7%, which is the best value reported for an OPV device to date. Importantly, this ternary material approach has wide-ranging applicability, as we demonstrated the same beneficial effects in multiple systems, including PM6:IT-4F, PM7:IT-4F, PM6:Y6, and PM7:Y6. The LUMO energy (−3.9 eV) of PCBM lies between the LUMO (−3.6 eV) of PM6/PM7 and the LUMO (−4.1 eV) of IT-4F/Y6, which is one reason for the increased Voc. After blending with PCBM, the homogenous fine-film morphology and the π–π stacking patterns of the host binary structure are maintained, while the phase purity is increased, the hole and electron mobilities are increased, and monomolecular recombination is reduced, all of which, plus the visible absorption of PCBM, are the reasons for the concurrently improved fill-factor and increased short-circuit current density. This approach can be used in other OPV systems and should have wide applicability.
Introduction
Great progress has been made regarding research into organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells in the past five years. Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 15% have been achieved from single-junction fullerene-free polymer-based binary blended material systems1 as a result of the inventions of low bandgap fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs),2–14 such as IT-4F (3,9-bis(1-oxo-2-methylene-3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-5,6-difluoro-indanone)-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-n-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3d:2′,3′d′]-s-indaceno[1,2b:5,6b′]dithiophene)15 and the very recently reported fused benzothiadiazole based Y6 (2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((12,13-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-e]thieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]indole-2,10-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))-bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile),1 and the design and synthesis of donor polymers as well.16–22 Thanks to recent developments in OPV design, especially examples including a donor and acceptor blend with spectrum complementarity as the active layer, in which the optical bandgap of the donor polymer is larger than that of the nonfullerene acceptor, both the short-circuit current-density (Jsc) and fill-factor (FF) values of devices have been largely increased. Relatively, the low open-circuit voltage (Voc) is becoming the main factor challenging further improvements in the efficiencies of OPV devices.23–26 In addition, the narrowed absorption, low mobilities, and strong recombination losses also challenge efficiency improvements. Finding new ternary material systems to overcome these issues, increasing the device Voc and, further, the PCEs of state-of-the-art high-efficiency binary blended material systems without sacrificing or even increasing their Jsc and FF values, is of urgent and fundamental importance.
A ternary approach is carried out via introducing a third component, either a donor or an acceptor,27–32 to extend the absorption range of the solar emission spectrum, tune the frontier molecular orbital levels,33 and modulate the active layer electric properties through improving the film morphology;34,35 this can promote the device Jsc, Voc, or FF, and, finally, boost the PCE, with efficiency values reaching over 13% recently.36–39 Recently, the ternary approach, introducing a smaller bandgap nonfullerene acceptor as a near infrared (NIR) absorber to increase the Jsc value of fullerene-free binary blended material systems, has generated increasing interest.40–42 Structural similarities between the selected two nonfullerene acceptors allows them to be well mixed to form homogenous acceptor phases with the maintaining of film morphologies, hence maintaining the device FF.43,44 However, the use of a smaller bandgap nonfullerene acceptor as the NIR absorber cannot increase the device Voc; it usually leads to a decreased Voc value45–47 in most cases, which can even lead to a lower PCE. To address the issue of the reduced Voc resulting from the “Jsc-increased” approach, we have very recently proposed a “Voc-increased” approach, using a higher-LUMO-level nonfullerene acceptor, such as ITCT or IDIC, as the acceptor guest to increase the Voc value of the fullerene-free binary host, such as PM6:IT-4F or PM6:Y6. The synergy between the host and guest acceptors along with the benefits of the guest complying with the aggregation of the nonfullerene host (IT-4F or Y6) leads to the obtaining of an increased FF48 and even increased Jsc values,49 achieving efficiencies of over 16%.
In this study, we report that PCBM ([6,6]-phenyl-C60-/C70-butyric acid methyl ester) is a promising acceptor additive to be used in such a Voc-increased ternary material approach – the device Voc can be effectively increased and, at the same time, both the Jsc and FF are also concurrently increased when PCBM is introduced into recently reported binary blended material systems with large Voc values, such as PM6:IT-4F, PM7:IT-4F, PM6:Y6, and PM7:Y6 (Fig. 1). The selection is based on the advantages of PCBM. First, the energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of PCBM is higher than the LUMOs of IT-4F and Y6 by about 0.2 eV. Again, the LUMO of PCBM is lower than the LUMO of the donor polymer PM6/PM7 by >0.3 eV. Therefore, the use of PCBM as an acceptor additive can increase the device Voc and again result in an increased Jsc value. Second, the good film-forming properties of PCBM and the good miscibility between PCBM and the nonfullerene acceptor not only help to maintain the film morphology of the fullerene-free host blend but also benefit the formation of homogeneous acceptor phases, through which the electrical properties can be improved.50–57
 Fig. 1  Chemical structures of the polymer donors PM6 and PM7, the nonfullerene small-molecule acceptors IT-4F and Y6, and the fullerene additives PC61BM and PC71BM. 
Our results demonstrate that larger Voc and higher FF values are both readily realized with the use of PC61BM or PC71BM as the acceptor additive in IT-4F- and Y6-based binary blends. In comparison with PC61BM, in which comparable Jsc values are obtained in both ternary and host binary devices, a slightly larger Jsc value is achieved in the PC71BM-based ternary solar cell, which is due to the relatively stronger absorption of PC71BM in the 300–700 nm wavelength region. Finally, PCEs of 13.8% and 14.0% are achieved from PM6:IT-4F and PM7:IT-4F binary structures, respectively, with the use of PC61BM as the extra acceptor component, and PCEs of 14.0% and 14.3%, respectively, are attained using PC71BM as the third component. Impressive PCEs of 16.7% and 16.2% are realized when PC71BM is added into PM6:Y6 and PM7:Y6 blends, respectively.
Results and discussion
To compare the relative HOMO/LUMO energy levels of the polymer donors and nonfullerene and fullerene acceptors, we measured the HOMO and LUMO energies of these compounds in solution using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV).58 Fig. S1† shows the DPV traces of these compounds, and their corresponding HOMO and LUMO energy levels were estimated from the first oxidation and reduction peak potentials, respectively (see Fig. S1† for calculation details). In o-C6H4Cl2 solution, two oxidation peaks can be clearly seen from IT-4F and Y6, indicating a two-electron oxidation process for these two nonfullerene acceptors. The first oxidation peaks (Eox: +1.38 V and +1.21 V) of IT-4F and Y6 give calculated HOMO energy levels of −5.58 eV and −5.41 eV, respectively. The first reduction peaks (Ered: −0.40 V and −0.44 V) of IT-4F and Y6 indicate LUMO energy levels of −3.80 eV and −3.76 eV, respectively. For the PCBM solutions, multiple well-defined reduction peaks and a well-shaped oxidation peak can clearly be seen. The first oxidation peaks (+1.73 V vs. +1.62 V) and first reduction peaks (−0.54 V and −0.56 V) of PC61BM and PC71BM suggest HOMO/LUMO energy levels of −5.93/−3.66 eV and −5.82/−3.64 eV for these two fullerenes, respectively. It is worth noting that the electrochemically derived LUMO levels of IT-4F/Y6 (−3.80/−3.76 eV) are clearly positioned below those of the PCBM materials (−3.66/−3.64 eV). For the polymers, broad three-peak oxidation bands are observed, and the first oxidation peaks (∼+1.26 V) were used to estimate the HOMO energies of the two donor polymers as being around −5.46 eV.
The HOMO and LUMO energy levels (Fig. 2a) of the donor and acceptor materials were further measured in thin film form via cyclic voltammetry (CV). All the films were measured under the same experimental conditions. The experimental data are shown in Fig. S2.† Fluorination of the terminal electron-accepting units of ITIC resulted in IT-4F with a much lower LUMO level (−4.15 eV) and a deeper highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level (−5.71 eV). The conjugation of bisfluorinated IC-2F (2-methylene-5,6-di-fluoro-3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)indanone) and a dithienothiophen[3.2-b]-pyrrolobenzothiadiazole core resulted in Y6 with low-lying LUMO and HOMO levels (−4.11 and −5.62 eV). Thanks to their deep HOMOs, IT-4F and Y6 can be blended with deep-HOMO donor polymers, such as PM6 and PM7 (Fig. 1), which allows a large Voc to be achieved, typically >0.83 V.
 Fig. 2  Energy level diagrams measured under the same conditions (Fig. S2†) (a) and normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of neat PM6, PM7, IT-4F, Y6, PC61BM and PC71BM films (b). 
The LUMO energy of PC61BM and PC71BM is −3.9 eV, which is >0.2 eV higher than those of IT-4F and Y6. The energy offset between the LUMOs of PM6/PM7 and PCBM is >0.3 eV. Again, the absorption spectra of PM6/PM7 complement well those of IT-4F and Y6 (Fig. 2b). For Y6, its broad absorption more fully benefits a complementary absorption spectrum when blended with PM6/PM7. PC71BM film shows absorption between 300 and 700 nm, which complements well with PM6(PM7):IT-4F and PM6(PM7):Y6 binary blends. Therefore, ternary blends with PC71BM as the third component not only more fully cover the solar emission spectrum of 300–850 nm in the case of PM6(PM7):IT-4F:PC71BM and 300–950 nm in the case of PM6(PM7):Y6:PC71BM, but they also having LUMO energies lying between the LUMOs of the donor PM6/PM7 and the acceptor IT-4F/Y6, which is helpful to obtain increased Voc and Jsc values at the same time.
OPV devices were fabricated with the conventional device structure of indium tin oxide (ITO) glass/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/ETL/Al. Here, PEDOT:PSS is poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate, and the ETL (electron transporting layer) is fabricated with PDINO (N,N-bis(3,3-dimethyl-3-amino-N-oxide-n-propyl)perylene diimide).59 The optimization data are shown in Table S1.† The weight ratio was 1:1:0.2 for PM6(PM7):IT-4F:PCBM and 1:1.2:0.2 for PM6(PM7):Y6:PC71BM. The active layer was optimized through varying the 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) content in PM6(PM7):IT-4F:PCBM, the 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) content in PM6(PM7):Y6:PC71BM and the thermal annealing (TA) temperatures. The film thickness for the IT-4F and Y6 based binary and ternary blends was about 100 nm. Note that the PC71BM material used in this study is a mixture of alpha, beta-1, and beta-2 isomers.60

Table 1 shows the photovoltaic properties of the IT-4F based optimal devices and Fig. 3a and c illustrate their current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics. The PM6:IT-4F binary solar cell shows an impressive FF of 75.9%, with a Voc value of 0.835 V, a Jsc value of 20.6 mA cm−2, and a PCE of 13.1%, while the PM7:IT-4F based device has a larger Voc value of 0.852 V, and hence, a higher PCE of 13.4%. In comparison to IT-4F based fullerene-free binary devices, the PCBM based devices exhibit much higher Voc values (0.91–0.96 V). The addition of PCBM as the extra acceptor component into IT-4F based binary systems leads to increased Voc values: for the PM6 ternary device, Voc is 0.86 V; for the PM7 ternary device, Voc is 0.87 V. For both the PM6 and PM7 based ternary devices, higher FFs than the host binary devices are always obtained, using either PC61BM or PC71BM as the extra acceptor component. Due to the relatively stronger absorption of PC71BM in the visible region, a slightly increased Jsc value can be readily obtained upon the use of PC71BM as the guest acceptor. Finally, PCEs of 13.8% and 14.0% were obtained from the PM6 and PM7 based devices with the use of PC61BM; with the use of PC71BM as the fullerene additive, 14.0% and 14.3% PCEs were obtained. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are given in Fig. 3b and d. The IT-4F based binary and ternary devices all show a wide EQE response with wavelengths ranging from 300 to 850 nm. The integrated Jsc values from the EQE spectra are given in Table 1, which are consistent with the Jsc values obtained from J–V measurements, with a deviation of less than 6% for all devices.

Y6 is a newly reported small molecule acceptor, which has given rise to a PCE of 15.7% with PM6 as the pairing donor polymer.1 We fabricated a PM6:Y6 binary device and obtained a PCE of 15.5%, with Jsc = 24.5 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.848 V, and FF = 0.746 (Table 2). The J–V curve and EQE spectrum of the optimal solar cell are given in Fig. 4a and b. The champion device shows a maximum EQE of 81% at around 620 nm, and the integrated Jsc value is 23.6 mA cm−2, matching well with the value from J–V measurements. Compared to PM6, PM7 is chlorinated rather than fluorinated (Fig. 1). As learned from the IT-4F systems, an even higher Voc value is available with the use of PM7 as the donor polymer. Therefore, we fabricated PM7:Y6 solar cells. The optimal PM7:Y6 binary device, with a weight ratio of 1:1.2, shows a higher Voc value of 0.875 V but a smaller FF than the PM6:Y6 solar cell. Finally, the PM7:Y6 system has a PCE of 15.4%. The maximum EQE of the champion PM7:Y6 device is 80% at around 620 nm.

Diagrams showing the distributions of the PCEs of PM6:Y6 (c) and PM7:Y6 (d) based binary and ternary devices. 
Photovoltaic studies of the IT-4F systems clearly indicate that, compared to the use of PC61BM, the usage of PC71BM enables further increased Jsc values with a simultaneous increase in the FF. We then selected PC71BM as the fullerene additive and fabricated PM6:Y6:PC71BM ternary solar cells. Compared to the binary solar cell data, increased Voc, FF and Jsc values are obtained at the same time, yielding a PCE of 16.7% (Table 2) with the use of a 0.2 ratio of PC71BM as the acceptor additive. We sent the best device to the National Institute of Metrology (NIM), China and received a certified PCE of 15.4% (Fig. S3†). We again fabricated PM7:Y6:PC71BM devices. The use of a 0.2 ratio of PC71BM again leads to increases in the Voc and FF values, with a small increase in Jsc (Table 2), compared to the PM7:Y6 binary device. Compared to the PM6:Y6:PC71BM ternary device, a larger Voc (0.884 V) but a smaller FF are obtained from the PM7:Y6:PC71BM (1:1.2:0.2) ternary device, yielding a smaller PCE; however, this is still above 16%, reaching 16.2%. The J–V curves of the Y6 based binary and ternary devices are shown in Fig. 4a and the EQE spectra are given in Fig. 4b. Fig. 4c and d show histograms of the PCEs obtained from the PM6:Y6 and PM7:Y6 based binary and ternary devices. Maximum EQEs of 82.5% at around 620 nm and 79.9% are observed for the PM6 and PM7 based ternary solar cells, respectively. The integrated Jsc values from the EQE spectra (Table 2) are in accordance with the Jsc values from the J–V measurements, with a deviation of <5% for all four devices.
To get information about the changes in LUMO energies when IT-4F and Y6 are blended with PCBM, we measured the LUMO energy variations as the weight ratio of nonfullerene (IT-4F or Y6) to fullerene (PC61BM or PC71BM) was changed from 1:0.1 to 1:0.3. The CV data are shown in Fig. S4† and the energy levels are given in Table 3. It can clearly be seen that the LUMO level of the nonfullerene:fullerene blend, either with IT-4F or Y6, is increased compared to the LUMO energy of neat IT-4F or Y6 film. The increased LUMO level is related to the higher LUMO level of PCBM compared to IT-4F and Y6, and explains the increase in the Voc values of the ternary device in comparison to its binary counterpart.

The hole and electron mobilities (μh/μe) of the optimal binary and ternary blended solar cell films were measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with device structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au (hole-only) and ITO/TIPD/active layer/PDINO/Al (electron-only), respectively. Fig. S5† shows the dark J–V data obtained from the hole-only and electron-only devices. The μh and μe values were estimated to be of the order of magnitude of 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the IT-4F and Y6 blends, including in the binary devices and their PCBM based ternary counterparts (Fig. 5a). For the IT-4F and Y6 based blends, the hole and electron mobilities are both increased upon the addition of PCBM. For the IT-4F blends, either binary or ternary, balanced hole and electron mobilities are observed, with the hole mobility a little larger than the electron mobility. For the Y6 blends, the hole mobilities are 2–3 times smaller than the values obtained from the IT-4F based systems, while the electron mobilities are close to the values of the IT-4F blends. Therefore, in the Y6 blends, the μh/μe ratios are 0.39–0.49 and the ratios are 1.06–1.10 in the IT-4F blends, both for PM6 and PM7 based binary and ternary films.
 Fig. 5  Scatter plots of the hole and electron mobilities (μh and μe) (a), saturated photocurrent densities (Jph,sat) and short-circuit photocurrent densities (Jph,sc) (b), and recombination α and n values derived from plots of Jsc and Vocversus light intensity (c) from IT-4F and Y6 based binary and ternary blends with either PM6 or PM7 as the donor polymer. 
Compared to the J–V curves, the photocurrent density (Jph)–effective voltage (Veff) curves (Fig. S6†) reflect the dissociation of photogenerated bound charges under different effective voltages.61 Here, Jph is defined as JD–JL, where JL and JD are the current densities under 100 mW cm−2 illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff is obtained via the relationship Veff = VBI − Vbias, where Vbias is the applied voltage and VBI is the voltage when Jph = 0 mA cm−2. In the Jph–Veff plot, Jph becomes saturated at a high applied voltage (Veff ≥ 2.0 V), and this photocurrent density value is denoted as Jph,sat, which reflects the full dissociation of photogenerated charges at a high applied voltage. Alternatively, Jph,sc reflects the photocurrent density obtained under short-circuit conditions. The Jph,sat and Jph,sc values of the IT-4F and Y6 based binary and ternary devices are shown in Fig. 5b. For the IT-4F based devices, larger Jph,sat and Jph,sc are seen upon adding PC61BM as the additive, which could be due to contributions from the PC61BM absorption and the increased electron and hole mobilities. The use of PC71BM results in even larger Jph,sat and Jph,sc values, which could be due to even stronger absorption in the visible region. The contribution of the absorption of PC71BM can be further supported by the fact that the electron and hole mobilities of the PC71BM ternary blend are both smaller than the values of the PC61BM based ternary blend, as observed in the IT-4F systems, while the Jph,sat value of the PC71BM ternary blend is larger than the PC61BM ternary blend value. For the Y6 systems, the narrowed bandgap of Y6 compared to IT-4F is the factor behind the generation of even larger Jph,sat and Jph,sc values. Larger Jph,sat and Jph,sc values are also obtained upon the addition of PC71BM into the PM6:Y6 and the PM7:Y6 systems.
The recombination mechanisms were studied through examining the light intensity dependent J–V characteristics;62 from these, Jsc and Voc as a function of the illumination intensity (Plight) are plotted in Fig. S7.† At the open-circuit potential, the recombination can be reflected via Voc ∝ n(KT/q)ln(Plight), where k, T, and q are the Boltzmann constant, temperature in kelvin, and elementary charge, respectively. If bimolecular loss is dominant, then n = 1; if monomolecular recombination is seriously involved, then n = 2. The fitted n values are 1.1–1.4KT/q, suggesting the involvement of monomolecular recombination. For both the IT-4F and Y6 systems, the use of PCBM reduces monomolecular loss, as suggested by the obtaining of smaller n values (Fig. 5c). Similar n values are obtained when using PC71BM and PC61BM as additives. Compared to the use of PM6, a smaller n value is seen with PM7 as the donor polymer. At the short-circuit potential, the recombination can be reflected by the power-law dependence of Jsc (Jsc = Plightα). Linear scaling of Jsc with Plight suggests that recombination is dominated by a monomolecular mechanism, while sublinear scaling indicates the involvement of bimolecular recombination. For all solar cells, the fitted α values are between 0.99 and 1.00 (Fig. 5c), indicating that weak bimolecular loss is involved.
Taken together, first, the use of PCBM as the third component reduces monomolecular loss in both IT-4F and Y6 based solar cells. Second, the absorption of PCBM, particularly PC71BM, in the visible wavelength region contributes to photocurrent generation. Finally, the use of PCBM improves the charge transport properties, with increased hole and electron mobilities. These are three reasons associated with the increased Jsc and FF values when using PCBM as the additive acceptor component.
The film morphologies of the binary and ternary blended solar cell films were first investigated via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). In TEM images (Fig. 6a–e), the bright and dark domains correspond to donor polymer- and acceptor-rich domains, respectively. For the IT-4F and Y6 based binary and ternary blends, nanoscale fine and homogenous morphologies are clearly seen, consistent with the high device FFs. For both the IT-4F and Y6 blends, more contracted phase-separated white and dark domains are formed upon the mixing of PCBM, reflecting the improved phase separation. Compared to the PC61BM blend, relatively larger dark domains are seen in the PC71BM based ternary blends. Relatively finer and more homogeneous separated phase domains are observed in the Y6 blends than the IT-4F blends. Fig. 6f–j shows AFM height images. The bright fibril phases and dark brown domains are assigned to the donor polymer of PM6 and the acceptor, respectively. Compared to the IT-4F binary blend, finer and shorter bright fibers are seen in the Y6 blended film, which agrees with the observation of smaller hole mobilities in the Y6 based blends compared to the IT-4F blends. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness is 2.15 nm for the PM6:IT-4F (1:1) binary blend, and this increases to 5.22 nm and 4.55 nm for the PC61BM and PC71BM ternary blends, respectively. The PM6:Y6 blend has a much smoother surface, with a smaller RMS value of 0.85 nm, compared to the IT-4F based binary blend. Although the RMS value increases to 1.04 nm after the PM6:Y6 binary sample is blended with PC71BM, its ternary blend surface is still much smoother than the IT-4F based ternary film, demonstrating much better mixing between Y6 and PCBM.

To see the change in the packing of Y6 and IT-4F molecules after PC71BM is added into the PM6:Y6 blend, we collected graze-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) data from PM6:PC71BM, PM6:Y6, PM6:Y6:PC71BM, PM6:IT-4F:PC71BM, and PM6:IT-4F blends (Fig. 7) and pure Y6, PC71BM, IT-4F, and PM6 films for comparison (Fig. S8†). The PC71BM amorphous scattering ring is seen at around 1.31 Å−1 in the PM6:PC71BM blend. The weak π–π stacking peak corresponding to PM6 can be seen at around 1.75 Å−1 (d: ∼3.59 Å) in the out-of-plane direction, with a ring-like lamellar peak at 0.305 Å−1 (d: ∼20.6 Å), suggesting weak face-on orientation. On the contrary, PM6:Y6 employed strong face-on orientation, as suggested by the π–π stacking (q: ∼1.77 Å−1; d: ∼3.57 Å) and lamellar (q: ∼0.300 Å−1; d: ∼20.9 Å) signals being strictly in the out-of-plane and in-plane directions, respectively. The crystallinity is also greater than PM6:PC71BM, as indicated by the overall high peak intensity. There is an additional peak (q: ∼0.425 Å−1; d: ∼14.8 Å) in the in-plane direction, which could originate from the backbone ordering previously found in Y6.1,63 The position of the π–π stacking signal of Y6 is well maintained when Y6 is blended with PM6 and, further, following the addition of PC71BM as the third component. No obvious changes are seen in the overall scattering pattern when PC71BM is added into the PM6:Y6 blend as the third component, suggesting that the π–π stacking pattern of the original PM6:Y6 is well maintained. Similar scattering patterns are again seen for the IT-4F binary blend and its PC71BM ternary blend, suggesting the maintaining of the π–π stacking pattern.

To see the changes in the phase purity after blending with PC71BM, binary and ternary blends are characterized with resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) at a photon energy of 284.8 eV. The data were plotted in Iq2versus q format and are given in Fig. 8. For both the Y6 and IT-4F systems, the phase purity is increased after the addition of PC71BM, as indicated by the increased scattering intensity of the peak at around 0.15 Å−1 in the Y6 system and at around 0.068 Å−1 in the IT-4F system. The phase purity is increased from 0.883 in the binary blend to about 1 in the ternary blend. The increased phase purity is consistent with the observations of improved phase separation in the TEM images obtained after the addition of PCBM, and also agrees with the decrease in charge recombination and the increase in the device FF. The domain sizes estimated from the RSoXS data are 20.4 nm and 46.4 nm for the Y6 and IT-4F ternary blends, respectively. The smaller domain size of the Y6 ternary blend is in accordance with the smaller RMS value observed from AFM measurements.

Conclusions
In summary, we present herein a highly efficient ternary blended organic photovoltaic cell having an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.7%, with the use of a simple yet effective ternary material approach. This ternary material approach is demonstrated, with PCBM as the additive acceptor component, to effectively increase the open-circuit voltage and, at the same time, result in concurrent increases in the short-circuit current densities and fill-factors of fullerene-free binary blended multiple material systems, including PM6:IT-4F, PM7:IT-4F, PM6:Y6, and PM7:Y6. After blending with PCBM, the homogeneous fine film morphology and π–π stacking pattern of the host binary blend are maintained, and the phase purity is increased. The increased charge mobility and reduced monomolecular recombination, plus the visible absorption of PCBM, are the factors behind the increases in the short-circuit current densities and fill factors. With PC71BM, which shows stronger absorption in the visible region compared to PC61BM, as the third component, even larger short-circuit current densities can be obtained. Finally, PCEs of 16.7%, 16.2%, 14.3% and 14.0% are obtained via adding PC71BM into host binary blends of PM6:Y6, PM7:Y6, PM7:IT-4F, and PM6:IT-4F, respectively. The efficiencies of the binary devices are 15.5%, 15.4%, 13.4%, and 13.1%, respectively. Note that during the revision of this study, a study involving ternary PM6:Y6:PC61BM with an efficiency of 16.5% was reported.64 Our efficiency of 16.7% is slightly higher due to the stronger absorption of PC71BM compared to PC61BM, as is well demonstrated by our study of the IT-4F system.
