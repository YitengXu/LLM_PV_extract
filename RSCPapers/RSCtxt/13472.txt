    , Accepted 14th September 2022First published on 22nd September 2022AbstractMetal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with bimetallic centers are considered as promising electrode materials for supercapacitors due to the large specific surface area and potential redox sites. In this work, the internal structure evolution, electron transfer in the metal center, and the mechanism of action of the Mn dopant to enhance conductivity in electrochemical processes are discussed. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the introduction of Mn ions greatly reduces the band gap of the Ni-MOF and increases the carrier concentration, confirming the electron transfer process of electrons from Ni2+ to Mn2+ through the bridging oxygen. Therefore, the optimal NiMn-MOF produces an impressive specific areal capacity of 1.89 mA h cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2. Meanwhile, a hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) based on the NiMn-MOF electrode and activated carbon (AC) can output a high specific energy of 67.5 W h kg−1 at a specific power of 84.5 W kg−1 with excellent cycling stability (capacity retention of 94% after 10000 cycles). Taking advantage of the high-energy storage properties of the NiMn-MOF//AC supercapacitor device, a solar power generation system is further integrated for self-powered portable electronic applications. This work broadens the applicability of activity prediction for bimetallic MOF electrode materials with high electrochemical performance.
Introduction
The “double-carbon” strategy urgently requires the high-quality development of energy storage devices. The energy shortage and environmental degradation issues promote the development of green and renewable power sources.1–3 In this respect, fuel cells, metal–air batteries, and electrochemical capacitors have attracted widespread attention.4,5 As an innovative type of electrochemical energy storage device between traditional capacitors and batteries, supercapacitors (SCs) have attracted great interest due to their advantages of fast charge and discharge, high specific power, and outstanding cycling stability.5–7 However, SCs still suffer from low specific energy, which is unable to respond to the growing demands of practical electronics and hybrid vehicles.8 Therefore, a possible way to obtain high specific energy of SCs without compromising specific power is to assemble well-matched HSCs comprising of one EDLC-type electrode and battery-type electrode.9,10 Among them, the battery-type Faraday electrode significantly improves the specific energy through its inherent tremendous charge storage capacity, while the capacitive EDLC electrode is to maintain the advantages of high specific power and long cycle life.11–13 It is worth noting that the hybridization of two different electrodes operating in different potential windows will expand the working voltage and thus achieve higher specific energy.
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), composed of metal atoms coordinated with organic ligands, exhibit large surface areas, tailored structures, and multifunctional properties.14–16 They have aroused extensive attention in various fields such as gas storage, catalysis and so on.17–19 Recently, MOFs have emerged directly as electrode materials in energy storage systems, which provide interesting attention for superior charge storage due to their high porosity and open metal center sites prone to reversible redox reactions.20,21 However, MOFs, due to their weak coordination bonds, are easily hydrolyzed in the presence of water vapor, resulting in framework collapse. Various methods have been adopted to improve the water stability of skeleton materials, such as modifying hydrophobic groups in ligands, using inert metal clusters, covering the crystal surface with hydrophobic layers, etc. Zhou and Li have previously reported an unstable Zn2+ framework material STU-1 in boiling water, and the results show that by doping a small amount of metal ions (Cu2+, Cd2+, or Fe2+), resulting in framework materials with ultra-high water stability, these material samples remained stable after 7 days of immersion in boiling water, while showing extraordinary stability to strong acids, strong bases and organic solvents. The results demonstrate that the doping of other metals may change the internal environment of the channel, resulting in strong hydrophobicity of the inner surface of the channel. This method of regulating the stability of MOFs by doping a small amount of metal ions provides a new idea for the improvement of the properties of porous metal–organic frameworks.22,23
In addition to improving the stability of the electrode aqueous system, metal doping can also improve the electrochemical performance of MOF materials, because the bimetallic system can significantly increase the electron transport between active species, thereby improving the electrochemical kinetic performance.24–27 For example, lattice-strained bimetallic NiCo-MOFs have shown impressive electrochemical energy storage activity, exhibiting an ideal preference for the electrodynamic pathway.28 Organometallic structures offer various as yet unexplored avenues to modulate the synergistic electronic interactions of bimetallic centers and, thus, promote electrochemical activity as a whole. For instance, Wang et al.29 designed Mn-doped ultrathin Ni-MOF nanosheet array on nickel foam serves as a highly capacitive and stable supercapacitor positive electrode, displaying a prominent specific capacity of 1178 C g−1 at 2 mA cm−2, which is due to the oxidation state and the synergistic effect of bimetal in MOFs. However, to our knowledge, these well-defined recombination ratios remain undetermined for most recently developed bimetallic MOF-based electrode materials. This lack of progress is mainly due to the unclear relationship between the optimized electronic structure and electrochemical activity, leading to uncertainties regarding the applicability of electronic structure modulation for optimizing energy storage. Gaining this understanding will facilitate the development of electronic structure/electrochemical kinetics relationships, thereby facilitating the rational design of efficient organometallic framework electrode materials.
Here, we report Mn-doped Ni-MOF shuttle-like nanosheets (NiMn-MOFs) on nickel foam (NF) via a low temperature polarity-induced method. The electrochemical activity of the NiMn-MOF structure was altered by tuning the Ni/Mn molar ratio. The optimized Ni/Mn (7:3) sample (labeled as the Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOF) exhibits unique O-bridged Ni–Mn bimetallic center structural properties, characterized by multiple techniques. XPS analysis and DFT calculations show that the strong electronic coupling between Ni and Mn initiates an efficient interatomic electron transfer process. As a consequence, the Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOF nanosheet array electrode preserves the outstanding specific capacity of 1.89 mA h cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2. In addition, the assembled Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOF//active carbon (AC) HSC achieved a specific energy of 67.5 W h kg−1 at a specific power of 84.9 W kg−1 and good cycling stability with 94% of initial capacitance retention after 10000 cycles.
Experimental
Materials
Manganese chloride tetrahydrate (MnCl2·4H2O), nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O), 1,4-dicarboxybenzene (C8H6O4) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) were purchased from Aladdin. All chemicals were used without further purification.
Preparation of NiMn-MOFs on Ni foam
NiMn-MOF/NF nanoarchitectures were prepared on Ni-foam via a facile polarity induced solvothermal method under controlled growth parameters. Taking the synthesis of NiMn-MOF/NF (Ni/Mn = 7:3) as an instance. In the growth process, p-phthalic acid (3.5 mmol), Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (3.675 mmol) and MnCl2·4H2O (1.575 mmol) were dispersed in 30 mL of DMF to prepare precursor solution, stirring at 25 °C for 20 min. After that, 2 mL of ethanol and 2 mL of H2O were added dropwise to the solution and continued to stir for 10 min. Subsequently, the solution and well-cleaned Ni-foam substrate were transferred into a 40 mL autoclave, and kept at 120 °C for 12 h. After cooling, the samples were washed with ethanol and dried at 60 °C. The active material was denoted as the Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOF. Nickel–manganese bimetallic metal–organic frameworks with different Ni/Mn molar ratios were also synthesized by adjusting the Ni2+/Mn2+ molar ratio to be 1:0, 0.9:0.1, 0.4:0.6 and 0:1 in the precursor solution labeled as Ni-MOF, Ni0.9Mn0.1-MOF, Ni0.4Mn0.6-MOF and Mn-MOF, respectively. The average loading of the electrodes is 7.6 mg cm−2.
Characterization
The microstructures and morphologies of the NiMn-MOF were characterized by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, SUPRA 40, German Zeiss) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20). The crystal phase information of the sample was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/max TTR-III, Cu Kα). The surface elemental composition and valences were performed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Fisher Scientific Esxalab 250Xi) using a spectrometer with a dual Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV).
Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical measurements were performed in three electrode configurations with a CHI760E electrochemical workstation. All electrochemical property measurements of as-prepared samples include cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 2 M KOH. Herein, the Pt plate (1 cm × 1 cm) and Ag/AgCl are taken as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The areal specific capacity was calculated according to the following equation (eqn (1)):30 (1)where Cs represents the areal capacity (mA h cm−2), I is the charge–discharge current (A), Δt is the discharge duration (s), and a is the active area of the sample (1 cm × 1 cm), respectively.
A two-electrode system of the HSC device was assembled by a battery-type NiMn-MOF as the cathode and AC as the anode. The negative electrode was prepared by grounding AC, acetylene black and polytetrafluoroethylene at a ratio of 15:4:1 and then uniformly coated on a NF (1 × 1 cm2). The system of charge balance between the positive and negative electrodes was obtained using the formula:31 (2) (3)
where m is the mass loading of active materials (g), ΔV is the voltage window of electrodes (V), and C represents the specific capacitance of electrodes (F g−1).
Subsequently, the specific energy and specific power were estimated as follows:32 (4) (5)where E denotes the specific energy (W h kg−1), P corresponds to the specific power (W kg−1) and M refers to the total mass of active materials on both electrodes (g).
Density function theory calculations
All the computations were calculated using the commercial Cambridge Sequential Total Energy Package Program (CASTEP).33 Generalized gradient approximation with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional was adopted for total energy calculations. The ultrasoft pseudopotential was used to treat core electrons. The energy cut-off was set to 550 eV. The vacuum region between slabs is 15 Å. The Brillouin zone of the surface unit cell was sampled by Monkhorst–Pack grids. The MP grids were set as 4 × 4 × 1 for all the surfaces and slabs, respectively.
Results and discussion
Surface investigation of the NiMn-MOF modified electrodes
The rational fabrication process of the NiMn-MOF deposited on Ni-foam by a facile one-step polarity induced solvothermal method with the hypothermia process is illustrated in Fig. 1a. First, terephthalic acid as an organic ligand together forms a growth solution in an appropriate amount of DMF solvent. Different molar ratios of nickel ions and manganese ions as metal precursors play a crucial role in the control of the morphology and structure. Second, in order to change the polarity, H2O and ethanol had been added to the above solution and NiMn-MOF nanostructures with optimized energy storage characteristics were obtained. The surface morphology and microstructure of the prepared samples were investigated by the SEM technique. As shown in Fig. 1b and c, the cross-connected Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOF nanosheet arrays consist of numerous horizontal shuttle-like nanosheets with abundant channels and completely cover the surface of the nickel foam. These nanosheets are interleaved to fabricate a 3D network with lots of open spaces, contributing to fast and efficient ion charge transfer and electron transport. This morphology may be due to the fact that growth on the facet requires the continuous formation and breaking of strong metal–ligand bonds, whereas growth with the c-axis perpendicular to the sheet is weakly controlled by covalent stacking interactions.34 Moreover, the morphology of the MOF structure was tuned by varying the Ni/Mn molar ratios, and the block nano-units gradually transform into nanosheets with an increase of the Ni/Mn molar ratio (Fig. S1†). This may be due to the difference in ionic radius and physical and chemical properties between Ni and Mn limiting the isotropic growth size of nanosheets.34,35 Meanwhile, the high-magnification SEM image of the Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOF shown in Fig. 1c shows interlaced connected nanosheets with a length of 1.0 μm on Ni foam. It is precisely because of the stacked nanostructures with plentiful channels of the Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOF that it has a larger active site, extraordinary electrochemical activity and wider interspace for the penetration of electrolyte ions, which enhances the redox reactions and charge storage performances. TEM has been used for further analysis of the morphology of the as-prepared samples (Fig. 1d). Although XRD results indicated crystallization, due to the nature of the Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOF, it is easily decomposed under strong electron beams, so it is difficult to find the corresponding lattice fringes in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of the Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOF (Fig. 1e). Fig. 1f shows that the Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOF contains Ni, Mn, C, and O elements without other impurities, and these elements are uniformly distributed in the Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOF frame structure without aggregation between particles, which is consistent with the TEM results.

The phases of the materials, functional groups, and elemental valence state of the prepared samples were further evaluated by XRD, FT-IR, and XPS analyses, respectively. Fig. 2a displays the XRD patterns of the as-synthesized Mn-doped Ni-MOF samples. NiMn-MOFs with different doping ratios exhibit similar crystal structures to the Ni-MOF or Mn-MOF (Fig. S2a†). In addition, the positions of the characteristic peaks did not change significantly with the Ni–Mn molar ratio. Since the ionic radii of Ni and Mn are close and the XRD patterns of the as-prepared MOFs are similar, the Ni-MOF and NiMn-MOF will have the same internal structure (Fig. 6a and b).36 Moreover, note that the weakening and broadening of the peaks with an increase in Mn doping may indicate a decrease in crystallinity due to disorder or defects in the Mn doping lattice.37 In the FTIR spectrum of the NiMn-MOF (Fig. 2b), the strong absorption band at 3625 cm−1 is assigned to the OH-stretching vibration in NiMn-MOFs, and the absorption band at 1496 cm−1 corresponds to the p-aromatic CH group.38,39 Besides, two bands of antisymmetric and symmetric stretching modes of –COO– are observable at 1578 cm−1 and 1370 cm−1. Those absorption bands are slightly shifted to a lower wavenumber region (blue shift) compared with the uncoordinated bulk p-phthalic acid the stretching vibration of –COO– (1678 cm−1), proving the successful coordination between the metal ion and the ligand molecule.40 Besides, the FTIR result of the Mn-MOF is also shown in Fig. S2b.† Therefore, based on the above analysis, the structure of the bimetallic synergistic MOF can be further demonstrated.

Furthermore, the electronic properties of the Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOF were analyzed on XPS. As shown in the survey spectra (Fig. 2c), the Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOF is composed of Ni, Mn, O, and C elements without any impurities, which have good agreement with EDX analysis of Fig. S3.† And the percentages of Ni and Mn ions are 11.0 and 4.3, respectively, which are close to the theoretical values (inset in Fig. S3†). Fig. 2d shows the C 1s spectrum, and the three peaks at 284.60, 285.20 and 288.54 eV are assigned to the CC, C–O, and O–CO bonds, respectively.41 The high-resolution spectrum of Ni 2p shows a peak at 856.10 eV (Fig. 2e), which is related to the Ni–O bond in the bimetallic system. Interestingly, when the MOF structure changes from monometallic to bimetallic, the peak shifts slightly towards higher binding energies. Furthermore, in the O 1s spectrum (Fig. S4†), two peaks located at 531.30 and 532.20 eV further demonstrate the existence of metal–oxygen bonds and the group of carboxylates (O–CO).42 The peak of Mn 2p at 641.68 eV in the bimetallic MOF can be attributed to the high spin intrinsic property of Mn2+ in the co-connector (Fig. 2f). In contrast, the Mn 2p of the monometallic manganese MOF is 641.16 eV. The observed shift might have resulted from the interaction between the bimetals, which can be explained by electron-density migration from Ni to Mn through the bridged oxygen.43,44 This phenomenon is beneficial for modifying the electron structure of the active Ni center and facilitating the transfer of electrons between metal centers, thereby optimizing the adsorption/desorption of oxygen-containing groups (OH−) for the improvement of electrochemical activity.45
Electrochemical performance analyses
The electrochemical behavior of the Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOF electrode was further evaluated in 2 M KOH using a three-electrode system. For comparison, Ni0.9Mn0.1-MOF, Ni0.4Mn0.6-MOF, and Ni-MOF electrodes were also evaluated under the same operating conditions and those detailed electrochemical results are compared. The CV plots of the Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOF electrode are measured at various scan rates ranging from 0.5 to 20 mV s−1 in the potential window of −0.1 to 0.7 V (Fig. 3a). All the CV curves exhibit visible reduction and oxidation peaks due to the redox transitions of Ni2+/Ni3+ and Mn3+/Mn4+ under the aid of OH− ions, which is a typical characteristic of battery-type behavior. The correlation calibration curves of the square root of the scan rate and oxidative and reductive peak currents (R2 = 1) are shown in the inset of Fig. 3a, showing that the energy storage reaction at a given electrode surface is a diffusion-controlled electrochemical process. Fig. 3b shows the GCD measurement result of the Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOF electrode with different current densities, and the nonlinear performance and symmetry of GCD curves indicate fast storage and release of charge, confirming the reports of CV analysis. Moreover, the reversible redox reaction process might be summarized using the following equation (eqn (6)):46,47 (6)

(l) Schematic diagram showing the merits of the sample during the electrochemistry analysis. 
The CV curves (measured at the same scan rate of 10 mV s−1) and GCD curves (measured at the same specific current of 3 mA cm−2) of the four electrodes are shown in Fig. 3c and d. Apparently, the Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOF electrode has the largest integral area and longest discharge time, indicating that it has the highest storage charge capacity among all electrodes. On the other hand, the CV and GCD series curves of the Ni-MOF, Ni0.4Mn0.6-MOF, Ni0.9Mn0.1-MOF and Mn-MOF electrodes are also shown in Fig. S5–S8.† All samples exhibited similar CV and GCD curves, which indicated that all samples with or without Mn ions could accommodate ions through electrochemical kinetic behavior. As shown in Fig. 3e, the areal capacities are calculated from the GCD curves among different MOF electrodes. Obviously, the Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOF electrode exhibits the highest areal capacity (1.59 mA h cm−2 at 3 mA cm−2) than that of the Ni0.9Mn0.1-MOF (1.22 mA h cm−2), Ni-MOF (1.26 mA h cm−2) and Ni0.4Mn0.6-MOF (1.09 mA h cm−2) at the same specific current. Upon increasing the amount of the Mn ions doped, the specific capacity initially increases and then decreases. This may be due to the structural instability caused by excessive Mn doping. The maximum specific capacities are 1.59 mA h cm−2 at a current density of 3 mA cm−2 for the Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOF, even at 12 mA cm−2, a capacity of 1.19 mA h cm−2 still remains, indicating its high-rate capability.
The comparison of the performance of the Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOF electrodes with other bimetallic MOF based electrodes is given in Table 1. In order to make the data more comparable, the calculated data are basically the areal capacity. It can be seen that our sample exhibits much better performance than other bimetallic MOF materials.24,42,47–51,53–55 Notably, our samples all have a larger mass loading compared to previously reported results, but it still has the largest specific capacitance, further implying its best electrochemical performance.

To obtain an in-depth understanding of the enhancement of the electrochemical kinetics, the EIS measurements of the optimized NiMn-MOF were analyzed. The Nyquist diagrams (Fig. 3f and S9†) of the Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOF, Ni0.9Mn0.1-MOF, Ni0.4Mn0.6-MOF and Ni-MOF electrodes all exhibit a semicircle at a high frequency and an inclined line at a low frequency (inset is an equivalent circuit). The intercept at the real axis denotes equivalent series resistance (Rs), consisting of the contact resistance at the active material/nickel-foam substrate, the intrinsic resistance of the active material and the solution resistance of the electrolyte. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) is related to the diameter of the semicircle and is caused by redox reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface. It is obvious that the Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOF has lower Rct (0.315 Ω) and Rs (1.441 Ω) values compared to the Ni-MOF in combination with the EIS of the equivalent circuit. This indicates that a part of the Ni2+ in the NiMn-MOF is replaced by Mn2+, which promotes the charge transfer rate during the redox reaction. Moreover, at low frequencies, the slope of the curve represents the Warburg resistance, and the more perfect vertical line of the Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOF electrode implies that the changes in the local coordination environment and electronic structure of the MOF further effectively promote the electrical conductivity. As shown in Fig. 3g, the Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOF electrode reveals lower internal resistance drop (IR drop) values compared with the Ni0.9Mn0.1-MOF, Ni0.4Mn0.6-MOF and Ni-MOF electrodes at different specific current, which are matched with the EIS results.
Furthermore, we analyzed the contributions of the capacitive and diffusion-controlled processes for the total charge-storage mechanism. The relationship between the peak current (i) and different scan rates (v) from the CV curves can be described by the following power law equation (eqn (7)):52,56 i = avb(7)where a and b are adjustable parameters. Generally, if b = 0.5, the major of the charge-storage is diffusion-controlled battery-like behavior, meanwhile, if b = 1, the majority of the charge-storage is influenced by surface capacitance. The b values (Fig. 3h) are given by the slope of the plot of log(i) versus log(v), which are 0.5135 and 0.5331 corresponding to the anodic and cathodic peaks for the Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOF electrode, respectively, indicating the diffusion-dominated battery-like behaviors.
At a particular potential, the response of current resulting from the surface-controlled current (k1v) and diffusion-dominated current (k2v1/2) using the following equation (eqn (8)):57 i(v) = k1v + k2v1/2.(8)
The parameters of k1 and k2 are constants, which can be obtained according to CV profiles at various scan rates. Fig. 3i exhibits detailed data on the contributions of the capacitive-controlled and diffusion-dominated processes, suggesting the predominance of diffusion-controlled charge-storage in the total processes. Fig. 3j and k exhibits the compared CV plots between the surface-controlled current and total current at 5 and 10 mV s−1. The capacitive contribution occupies about 36% and 46% of the total CV areas as shown in the shaded areas (k1v) of the CV curves at 5 and 10 mV s−1, respectively. Evidently, as the scan rate decreases, diffusion control gradually dominates the conventional battery-type material. Moreover, it is worth noting that the higher capacity, rate capability, and lower electrochemical impedance of the Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOF/NF shuttle like nanosheets could be ascribed to the following merits, as schematically presented in Fig. 3l. Firstly, the inherent shuttle like nanosheets of organometallic frameworks provide large area and abundant pores, allowing rapid ion penetration and maintaining a stable structure during the redox reaction process. Secondly, the strong electronic coupling between Ni and Mn triggered an effective interatomic electron transfer process, which is the key factor for the fast transfer of electrons of very efficient HCS electrodes. Thirdly, a similar size of Ni ions and Mn ions allows the Mn ions to dope into the Ni-MOF, forming more Ni ion vacancies. This effect might lead to an increase of the ‘free holes’ for the Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOF/NF, which in turn enhances its conductivity.
Simultaneously, it is meaningful for the as-synthesized Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOF electrode to further estimate the practicality. Hence, the Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOF//AC HSC device (Fig. 4a) has been assembled with the Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOF as the positive electrode and active carbon on NF (15 mg) as the negative electrode in 2 M KOH. The CV plots for both the Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOF electrode (−0.1 to 0.7 V) and the AC electrode (−1 to 0 V) at 10 mV s−1 are displayed in Fig. 4b. Fig. S10† shows the curve of the triangle GCD and the rectangle-like CV of thev AC electrode. In order to explore the most excellent operating voltage window, the CV and GCD curves of the HSC have been performed with different potential windows. As shown in Fig. 4c and d, when the device voltage is extended to 1.7 V, the corresponding curves appear slightly polarized, indicating a maximum device voltage of 1.6 V. The GCD analysis was performed by changing the current densities from 2 to 12 mA cm−2 under a continuous potential window of 0–1.6 V, as shown in Fig. 4e. The almost non-linear charge–discharge curves, as shown by the GCD curves, indicate the hybrid electrochemical contributions of the two electrodes. Furthermore, the symmetry of the charge and discharge times in all GCD curves signifies its splendid coulombic efficiency and rapid current–voltage response.58 After that, scan rate experiments were carried out for the fabricated HSC device at various scan rates of 2–12 mV s−1 with a device voltage of 0–1.6 V (Fig. 4f). The hybrid electrochemical behavior is clearly identified in each CV curve with the same shape, indicating the excellent reversibility of the proposed HSC.

The Ragone chart (specific energy versus specific power) of the HSC device is illustrated in Fig. 4g. Remarkably, the device has a fantastic specific energy of 67.5 W h kg−1 at a specific power of 84.9 W kg−1 which is competitive with previous MOF-derived devices, including Mn0.1–Ni-MOF//AC (39.6 W h kg−1 at 143.8 W kg−1) 53, NiCo-MOF//AC (34.3 W h kg−1 at 375 W kg−1),54 Co2–Ni-MOF//AC (25.92 W h kg−1 at 375 W kg−1),55 Ni-MOF//AC (31.5 W h kg−1 at 800 W kg−1),59 CNT@Mn-MOF//CNT@Mn-MOF (37.05 W h kg−1 at 112.6 W kg−1),60 and Co/Mn-MOF//AC (30 W h kg−1 at 2285.7 W kg−1).61 The calculated areal capacities of the HSC device are displayed in Fig. 4h. The excellent rate capability of 55% at a specific current of 12 mA cm−2 further confirms the outstanding balance of mass and unique charge storage properties of the HSC device. From Fig. 4i, the proposed HSC exhibits excellent energy efficiencies of 65.9% and 58% along with the coulombic efficiencies of 94.8% and 97.8% at specific current values of 5 and 12 mA cm−2, respectively. These results indicate that a small amount of energy was dissipated during the discharging process. The long-term cycling stability performance of the Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOF//AC HSC was further investigated to assess the electrochemical durability based on consecutive GCD cycles at a specific current of 25 mA cm−2 for 10000 cycles, as exhibited in Fig. 4j. The capacity retention of the supercapacitor remains 94%, and other previous reports are included in the inset of Fig. 4j, demonstrating the good cycling durability of the device. Fig. S11† displays the EIS plot of the corresponding device before and after 10000 cycles, and the change in the curve shape is not obvious indicating a negligible ohmic loss in the whole process.
In addition to high-energy storage properties, integrated hybrid systems have been further developed for self-powered electronic applications by harvesting solar energy. Herein, we attempted to design a solar powered NiMn-MOF//AC supercapacitor system, as shown in Fig. 5a. When sunlight is incident on the solar cells, green electricity is produced which can efficiently charge the supercapacitor device in a short period of time (Fig. 5b). Fig. 5c shows the circuit diagram for solar cells and three serially connected supercapacitor stems. The three HSCs energized a multifunction electronic display, a motor fan and various colored light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for a long time, as presented in Fig. 5d and e. These results strongly illustrate the feasibility of our integrated NiMn-MOF//AC device as a self-powered electronic system.

DFT calculation
To gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between the electronic structure and the electrochemical performance of NiMn-MOFs, we calculated the partial electronic density of states (PDOS) near the Fermi level of the model structure. From the optimized structure, Mn realizes the partial site occupation of Ni (Fig. 6a and b), PDOS studies concluded that the s-state of the H atom resonates with the p-state of the C atom, leading to the formation of a strong covalent bond in the energy range from −10 to −4.3 eV.62 The Fermi level of Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOFs spans the 3d orbital band of Ni, enabling the Ni sites to act as both electron donors and acceptors for efficient electrochemical redox reactions. In contrast, the main 3d orbital band of Mn is far from the Fermi level and mainly located at relatively high energy positions, indicating that the Mn site is a favorable electron acceptor (Fig. 6c). This phenomenon can also be explained by the electron transfer process of electrons from Ni2+ to Mn2+ through bridging oxygen.63 Mn2+ is a high-spin state 3d5 configuration formed by losing the outermost 4s electron, and the d orbital can be bridged with O2− through π back-donation. However, the d-orbital of another metal Ni is fully occupied in the MOFs, which greatly facilitates the electron transfer in the Mn–O–Ni junction.64 Furthermore, the density of states (DOS) for Ni-MOFs and Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOFs is calculated for comparison (Fig. 6d). Meanwhile, the localized charge density map was also calculated (Fig. S12†). The energy band curve of Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOFs is shown in Fig. 6e and S13,† the calculated Eg value of Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOFs (1.31 eV) is much narrower than that of the Ni-MOF (1.60 eV), which indicates that the introduction of Mn ions greatly reduces the bandgap of the Ni-MOF and can easily activate more electrons from the VBM to the CBM to increase the carrier concentration.65

Conclusions
In conclusion, a Mn-doped Ni-based metal–organic framework supported on nickel foam is a promising electrode material, and after rational design and synthesis, bridged oxygen bimetallic active centers were obtained through a low-temperature polarity-inducing strategy. The structure and electrochemical properties of NiMn-MOFs were revealed in detail by combining atomic-scale synchrotron radiation characterization with in-depth theoretical calculations, electrochemical active site properties, and electrochemical tests. Under the optimal growth conditions, the Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOF exhibited a high specific areal capacity of 1.89 mA h cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2, assembled with activated carbon to form Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOF//AC supercapacitors, and showed an excellent specific energy of 67.5 W h kg−1 at a specific power of 84.5 W kg−1. Meanwhile, we have fabricated a solar-powered Ni0.7Mn0.3-MOF//AC supercapacitor system that can be quickly charged in a short period of time and can power multifunctional electronic displays, motor fans, and various color LEDs for a long time. This work may lead to the design of cost-effective MOF-based high-performance electrode materials for energy-related applications.
