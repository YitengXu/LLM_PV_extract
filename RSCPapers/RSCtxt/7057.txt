    , Accepted 10th March 2014First published on 10th March 2014AbstractThe improvement of Z-scheme inspired biophotovoltaics is achieved by fine tuning the properties of redox hydrogels applied as immobilization and electron conducting matrices for the photosystem–protein complexes. The formal potentials of the redox hydrogels are adjusted to the respective redox sites in the photosystems for optimized electron transfer without substantial voltage loss. The anode is based on photosystem 2 (PS2) integrated in a phenothiazine modified redox hydrogel with a formal potential of −1 mV vs. SHE, which is 59 mV more positive than the QB acceptor site in PS2. The cathode is based on photosystem 1 (PS1) contacted via an Os-complex based redox hydrogel with a formal potential of 395 mV vs. SHE, i.e. 28 mV more negative than the primary P700 electron acceptor of PS1. The potential difference between the two redox hydrogels is 396 mV. An open circuit voltage (VOC) of 372.5 ± 2.1 mV could be achieved for the biophotovoltaic cell. The maximum power output is 1.91 ± 0.56 μW cm−2 and the conversion efficiency (η) is 4.5 × 10−5, representing a 125-fold improvement in comparison to the previously proposed device exploiting the photosynthetic Z-scheme for electrical energy production.
Introduction
Photosynthesis is the most fundamental process on earth, transforming solar energy into chemical energy. This process is realized in the thylakoid membranes of plants, algae and cyanobacteria and is based on two successive charge separation steps in the photosynthetic electron transfer chain (PET). The two photosystems, PS2 and PS1, are sequentially arranged in the PET.1 PS2 initializes the process by feeding electrons from its light-triggered catalytic water oxidation reaction2 into the PET. The second light induced excitation of electrons occurs at PS1, which provides a strong reductive force at its acceptor site. Finally, the electrons are transferred for the reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP*) as the final step in the PET.3 In parallel, the photosynthetic electron transport creates a proton gradient, which is utilized for ATP synthesis. Finally, NADPH and ATP are required in the Calvin cycle for the fixation of CO2. Overall, electrons are transferred in and in between both photosystems by a cascade of cofactors and diffusible electron carriers with decreasing redox potentials. Isolated photosystems have been shown to be useful for specific electrochemical reactions within photo electrochemical devices. Various types of PS1-based4,5 and PS2-based half-cells6,7 as well as autonomous biophotovoltaic systems based either on PS18,9 or on PS210 have been proposed.
Recently, we have demonstrated a proof of principle for a biophotovoltaic cell by combining a PS2-based photoanode and a PS1-based photocathode.11 The isolated proteins were immobilized and electrically connected by Os-complex modified redox hydrogels to the respective electrode surfaces (Fig. 1), resulting in a potential difference of about 100 mV. This approach provided an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 90 ± 20 mV as well as an overall cell power of 23 ± 10 nW cm−2.11 Although the correlation between VOC and the potential difference of the two redox hydrogels demonstrated the principle feasibility of the proposed approach, only a fraction of the energy representing the potential difference of 480 mV between QB of PS2 and P700 of PS1 was recovered.
 Fig. 1  Electron transfer pathway between photosystem 2 (PS2) and photosystem 1 (PS1) via redox polymers. Comparison of the previous system according to Kothe11 (grey arrows) and the present system using a toluidine blue O modified redox polymer (P023-TB) as immobilising redox hydrogel for PS2 (red arrows). All potentials are given in mV versus the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). 
In order to better exploit the potential difference between PS2 and PS1 and improve the efficiency of the biophotovoltaic cell, we optimized the redox polymers to match their potentials to that of the redox sites of the photosystems. The Os-complex modified redox hydrogel (Os1) previously used for PS2 photoanodes6,11 efficiently accepted electrons from the PS2 acceptor site due to a high driving force (455 mV), resulting in high photocurrents. Unfortunately, this contributes considerably to the fact that most of the energy harnessed via the light induced charge separation at PS2 is dissipated as heat in the electron transfer step between the QB site of PS2 and the Os-complex.
Here, we introduce a toluidine blue O modified redox polymer (P023-TB)12 with a low formal potential (−1 mV vs. SHE) to optimize the match with the acceptor side of PS2 at the photoanode (Fig. 1). Moreover, in the former setup of the biophotovoltaic cell,11 the Os-complex at the electron donor site of PS1 had a formal potential of +505 mV vs. SHE, i.e. much more positive than the primary electron acceptor P700 (+423 mV vs. SHE,13Fig. 1). The resulting slow electron transfer between the Os-complex and PS1 in the cathodic compartment limited the overall current density.11
In this report, we combine a recently optimized PS1-based cathode with the novel toluidine blue O/PS2 based anode in order to efficiently make use of the potential difference between PS1 and PS2. We achieved a cell power output and energy conversion efficiency which are about two orders of magnitude higher than those of the previous device.
Results and discussion
In order to substantially decrease the energy loss in the anodic half-cell the redox polymer should have a formal potential which is slightly more positive than the PS2 acceptor site. The formal potential of octahedral Os-complexes can be adjusted over a wide range by tuning the electron density via the chemical nature of the ligands at the Os-center.14 However, under aerobic conditions the reduction of oxygen at the metal complex15 is a limitation for low potential Os-complexes, resulting in a severe loss of power in related devices. To overcome this problem, we exploit recently developed phenothiazine modified polymers, which were successfully applied previously in glucose oxidizing bioanodes.12,16
Phenothiazine modified polymers typically exhibit formal potentials that match the terminal electron acceptor QB of PS2. Furthermore, the formal potential is pH-dependent based on the two electron-two proton transfer at the polymer bound redox active centers. As QB underlies the same reaction mechanism,17 any potential shift due to small pH-changes in the solution, e.g. by an enzymatic reaction, do not change the potential difference between QB and the polymer. This guarantees a constant driving force for the electron transfer from the enzyme to the polymer bound redox relays.
We selected several phenothiazine modified redox polymers, which are in a redox potential range suitable for accepting electrons from PS2. Redox hydrogels with a more negative formal potential than the formerly used Os1 increase the overall potential difference between both half-cells and should result in an increased open circuit voltage of the biophotovoltaic cell (Fig. 1).
A first screening of a series of different phenothiazine modified redox polymers was performed to identify the corresponding PS2 integrated hydrogels that yield the best photocurrent response. Four phenothiazine derivatives with different formal potentials (Fig. 2) as well as various polymer backbones with increasing hydrophilicity (Fig. S1, ESI†) were investigated. In this initial screening no additional stabilization procedures were used.
 Fig. 2  Screening of phenothiazine modified redox polymers for PS2-photocurrent generation. Formal potentials of toluidine blue (TB),18 nile blue (NB),18 azure blue (AzB),19 and neutral red (NR)20 are given vs. SHE. Electrodes were modified by using a 20 μg μL−1 polymer (except P004-NR, P022-NB, P018-AzB due to solubility limitations) and 1 μg μL−1 PS2 protein dissolved in buffer (50 mM MES pH 6.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM CaCl2). After 3 h incubation in the dark at 4 °C, the electrodes were gently washed with buffer (50 mM MES pH 6.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM CaCl2 and 0.03% [w/v] β-DM). Photocurrent measurements were done at an applied potential of +500 mV vs. SHE and at an illumination of 34.9 mW cm−2 at 685 nm. 
In general the photocurrent generation of PS2 immobilized in phenothiazine modified redox polymers increased with the hydrophilic character of the polymer backbones (P015-TB to P023-TB and P002-AzB to P022-AzB). From the preliminary screening the polymers P022-AzB and P023-TB have shown the highest photocurrents for the corresponding PS2-based anodes (Fig. 2). As expected the redox polymers modified with NB (nile blue) have shown the lowest photocurrents due to their substantially more cathodic formal potential.
As an initial step of improvement crosslinkers were introduced for stabilizing the hydrogel films, which otherwise re-dissolve. In particular, in the absence of crosslinking, the polymers with high hydrophilic character are lost from the electrode surface even faster than PS2 is degraded. Dithiol crosslinkers react with the remaining epoxide groups at the polymer backbone and stabilize the hydrogel films. However, in the case of the PS2-hydrogel based on P022-AzB, the crosslinking resulted in a significant shift in the redox potential which would prevent a sufficiently high open circuit voltage. In contrast, cross linkers had no impact on the hydrogel film properties of bioanodes based on P023-TB (data not shown). For this reason the polymer P023-TB (Fig. 3 left) was selected for further investigations with the related bioanodes.
 Fig. 3  Structure (left) and cyclic voltammogram (right) vs. SHE of the phenothiazine modified redox hydrogel P023-TB at 2 mV s−1 in buffer (MES 50 mM pH 6.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM CaCl2 and 0.03% [w/v] β-DM). 
Determination of the midpoint potential of P023-TB by cyclic voltammetry (Fig. 3 right) at pH 6.5 yielded a value of −1 mV (vs. SHE), i.e. considerably more negative than the 395 mV of the previously employed Os1 polymer (Fig. 1).
Further characterization of the PS2-based anodic half-cells was done by chronoamperometry. Applying a potential of +500 mV vs. SHE ensured that the electron transfer from the redox polymer to the electrode is not limiting. While illumination produced an average anodic photocurrent density of 10 μA cm−2 (Fig. 4, left), addition of the PS2-inhibitor dinoterb21 reduced this current to 25% (Fig. S2, ESI†). This clearly indicates that the light induced catalytic current originated from PS2.
For the PS1-cathode side, the Os-complex modified polymer (Os1) was used for which the redox hydrogel film formation was recently optimized to provide high current densities (up to 300 μA cm−2). Moreover, the formal potential of this redox polymer (+395 mV vs. SHE) was designed to match the donor site of PS1 (the difference is only 28 mV)5 making it an ideal compound to contact and immobilize PS1 on the cathode in the present study.
 Fig. 4  Photocurrents for PS2/P023-TB photoanode (left) and PS1/Os1 photocathode (right) half-cells. Anodic conditions: buffered electrolyte (MES 50 mM pH 6.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM CaCl2 and 0.03% [w/v] β-DM) with an applied potential of +500 mV vs. SHE. Cathodic conditions: buffered electrolyte (50 mM sodium citrate pH 4, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM CaCl2, 3 mM MV under continuous purging with pure oxygen) with an applied potential of +200 mV vs. SHE. Illumination intensity 34.9 mW cm−2 at 685 nm (sun = light on, moon = light off). 
The PS1-cathode half-cell was characterized by application of +200 mV vs. SHE, yielding a maximum photocurrent immediately after the onset of illumination of 210 μA cm−2 which stabilized at 140 μA cm2 (Fig. 4, right). These currents are at least ten times higher than the anodic photocurrents and confirm that the anodic half-cell is limiting in the biophotovoltaic cell.
The assembled biophotovoltaic cell was characterized at a light intensity of 21 mW cm−2 (at 685 nm), which is close to the light-saturation of the limiting anodic half-cell (Fig. S3, ESI†). Due to the setup of two half-cell compartments, buffers and pH-values could be separately optimized for each protein. While the Os-complex modified redox hydrogel Os1 provides a pH independent redox potential, the formal potential of the toluidine blue O modified redox polymer P023-TB shifts with the pH value. However, during photocurrent generation any potential shifts were prevented by using buffered electrolytes (pH 6.5, 50 mM MES, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM CaCl2 and 0.03% [w/v] β-DM) in the anodic half-cell.
The performance of the biophotovoltaic cell was determined by stepwise decreasing of the applied voltage between the two photoelectrodes, starting from VOC combined with the determination of photocurrent densities.22 The J–U curve is shown in Fig. 5 left exhibiting an VOC of 372.5 ± 2.1 mV which is in good agreement with the theoretical VOC of 396 mV as determined from the formal potential difference of the two redox polymers. The short circuit current density (ISC) is 9 ± 3.1 μA cm−2. Based on these data, the cell power (Pcell) was calculated and plotted against the potential (Fig. 5 right), with a maximum Pcell of 1.91 ± 0.56 μW cm−2 at a potential difference of 240 mV vs. VOC. The obtained power output, VOC and ISC result in a fill factor (ff) of 0.564. The ratio of power output (Pcell = 1.91 μW cm−2) and power input (PLED = 21 mW cm−2) for the total illuminated surface area (i.e. both photoelectrodes), yields a conversion efficiency (η) of 4.5 × 105.

Electrode modification
Glassy carbon disk electrodes (3 mm diameter, CH Instruments, USA) were cleaned by polishing with alumina oxide paste (0.3 μm grain size). After rinsing with water and drying by a nitrogen stream, PS1 immobilized in the Os-complex modified redox polymer Os1 was applied as follows:
A 2.5 μL droplet containing 5 μg μL−1 Os1, 1 μg μL−1 PS1 and 0.02 μg μL−1 poly(ethylene glycol)diglycidyl ether (PEGDGE, Polyscience, USA) dissolved in distilled water was placed on the electrode surface. After 24 h incubation at 4 °C in the dark, the electrodes were preincubated 1 h in buffered electrolyte solution pH 9 (50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM CaCl2 and 100 mM KCl).
Cleaned glassy carbon disk electrodes (3 mm diameter) were modified with PS2 immobilized in the redox polymer P023-TB as follows:
A 5 μl droplet containing 10 μg μL−1 P023-TB, 1 μg μL−1 PS2 and 70 μg μL−1 of 2,2′-(ethylenedioxy)diethanethiol (stock solution of 280 μg μL−1 dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide), diluted in buffer (10 mM MES pH 6.5, 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2 and 0.006% [w/v] β-DM), was placed onto the electrode surface. The electrodes were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C in the dark and thereafter washed for 5 min in buffer solution containing MES 50 mM pH 6.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM CaCl2 and 0.03% [w/v] β-DM.
Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical measurements were performed using an AUTOLAB PGSTAT12 potentiostat upon illumination with a LED (FAT-685-40, Roithner, Austria) with a maximum power output of 34.9 mW cm−2 at 685 nm.

Half-cell measurements. 
Chronoamperometric measurements of each half cell were done in a glass cuvette (2.5 cm diameter; 6 cm height) with a three electrode setup using a platinum wire (1 mm diameter) as a counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl (3.5 M KCl) reference electrode.26 For graphical representation the potential is shifted by +0.205 V corresponding to the saturated hydrogen electrode (SHE) as a potential scale. For both anodic and cathodic half-cell measurements the maximum light intensity of 34.9 mW cm−2 was used.
Measurements of the anodic half-cell with PS2 were done in 5 mL buffer (50 mM MES pH 6.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM CaCl2 and 0.03% [w/v] β-DM). In order to oxidize the polymer-bound redox species, a potential of +500 mV vs. SHE was applied.
Measurements of the cathodic half-cell with PS1 were done in 5 mL buffer (50 mM sodium citrate pH 4, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM CaCl2) supplemented by 3 mM MV under continuous purging with pure oxygen. In order to reduce the polymer-bound Os-complex a potential of +200 mV vs. SHE was applied.


Biophotovoltaic measurements. 
Measurements of the combined half-cells were performed in a two compartment system with a two electrode setup with PS1/Os1 as a working electrode and PS2/P023-TB as a short circuited counter and reference electrode. The anodic compartment contained (50 mM MES pH 6.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM CaCl2 and 0.03% [w/v] β-DM), while the cathodic compartment contained 50 mM sodium citrate pH 4, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM CaCl2, 3 mM MV. Both half-cells were connected via a salt bridge (3.5 M KCl). All measurements of the complete biophotovoltaic cell were done with a light intensity of 21 mW cm−2 (PLED).
Chronoamperometric measurements started with the determination of the VOC followed by a stepwise decrease by 30 mV vs. VOC and determination of the resulting photocurrents.22
The cell current density (Icell) was calculated from the surface area of one electrode (0.071 cm2) and plotted against the cell potential (Ucell). The product of both (Icell × Ucell) is the cell power density (Pcell), which is plotted against the cell potential (Ucell). The efficiency calculation is based on the illumination of both photoelectrodes (η = Pcell/2PLED).

Conclusion
Our previous study provided the proof of principle for mimicking the Z-scheme of photosynthesis by a biophotovoltaic device.11 In the present study we could now significantly improve the performance of this biophotovoltaic concept by adjusting the redox hydrogel potentials for both photoanode and photocathode. By this, the power output was increased by a factor of about hundred. Major reason for this improvement is the specific design of a toluidine blue O modified redox polymer with a formal potential suitably adapted for the PS2 photoanode. In combination with the optimized photocathode, this provides a maximum potential difference of 396 mV and an open circuit voltage of 372 mV, which represents a 4-fold enhancement as compared to our previous study. In addition, the optimized electron transfer at the PS1-photocathode results in a 10-fold enhancement in the overall current density. Moreover, the lower illumination intensity contributes to significantly increase the efficiency of the photobiocatalytic fuel cell.
Future studies will focus on an optimization of the given system by varying the polymer backbone and the cross-linking procedure to further increase the PS2 loading ability and the electron transport rate. Further developments in the cathode side may use its reductive force for the production of reduction equivalents such as NADP+ in analogy to nature. Most promising is the reduction of protons to hydrogen via PS1–H2ase nanohybrid constructs,27 PS1–H2ase fusion complexes28 or PS1–Pt nanoconstructs.9,29 This approach would lead to the conversion of solar energy into both electrical and chemical energy, the latter as H2.

 	Fig. 1  Electron transfer pathway between photosystem 2 (PS2) and photosystem 1 (PS1) via redox polymers. Comparison of the previous system according to Kothe11 (grey arrows) and the present system using a toluidine blue O modified redox polymer (P023-TB) as immobilising redox hydrogel for PS2 (red arrows). All potentials are given in mV versus the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE).	 

 	Fig. 2  Screening of phenothiazine modified redox polymers for PS2-photocurrent generation. Formal potentials of toluidine blue (TB),18 nile blue (NB),18 azure blue (AzB),19 and neutral red (NR)20 are given vs. SHE. Electrodes were modified by using a 20 μg μL−1 polymer (except P004-NR, P022-NB, P018-AzB due to solubility limitations) and 1 μg μL−1 PS2 protein dissolved in buffer (50 mM MES pH 6.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM CaCl2). After 3 h incubation in the dark at 4 °C, the electrodes were gently washed with buffer (50 mM MES pH 6.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM CaCl2 and 0.03% [w/v] β-DM). Photocurrent measurements were done at an applied potential of +500 mV vs. SHE and at an illumination of 34.9 mW cm−2 at 685 nm.	 

 	Fig. 3  Structure (left) and cyclic voltammogram (right) vs. SHE of the phenothiazine modified redox hydrogel P023-TB at 2 mV s−1 in buffer (MES 50 mM pH 6.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM CaCl2 and 0.03% [w/v] β-DM).	 

 	Fig. 4  Photocurrents for PS2/P023-TB photoanode (left) and PS1/Os1 photocathode (right) half-cells. Anodic conditions: buffered electrolyte (MES 50 mM pH 6.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM CaCl2 and 0.03% [w/v] β-DM) with an applied potential of +500 mV vs. SHE. Cathodic conditions: buffered electrolyte (50 mM sodium citrate pH 4, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM CaCl2, 3 mM MV under continuous purging with pure oxygen) with an applied potential of +200 mV vs. SHE. Illumination intensity 34.9 mW cm−2 at 685 nm (sun = light on, moon = light off).	 

 	Fig. 5  Biophotovoltaic cell consisting of a PS2/P023-TB anode connected via a salt bridge (3.5 M KCl) to a PS1/Os1 cathode. Left: photocurrents during chronoamperometry at various potentials with standard deviation (out of 3 replicates). Right: calculated power density output with a maximum at 240 mV (red). Anode buffer: MES 50 mM pH 6.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM CaCl2 and 0.03% [w/v] β-DM; cathode buffer: 50 mM sodium citrate pH 4, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM CaCl2, 3 mM MV, continuously purged with pure oxygen. Illumination with 21 mW cm−2 at 685 nm.
