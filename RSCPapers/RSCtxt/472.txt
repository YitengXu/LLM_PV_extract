    , Accepted 8th August 2017First published on 8th August 2017AbstractSi has been studied as a photocathode for water splitting; however, its commercial application is hindered by its poor stability and low solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency (η), where the effective loading of catalysts on the Si surface is one of the key factors. Herein, we report that uniform and small Pt nanoparticles (NPs) were successfully prepared on an n+p-Si pyramid surface by a cheap electroless deposition method using Pt salt, based on the hydrophilic character of SiO2. A high η of 10.5% was obtained under 100 mW cm−2 simulated solar illumination with a Pt loading of only 1 μg cm−2, due to the fact that the Pt NPs are small enough to avoid the optical loss of Si, are distributed uniformly on the light-trapping pyramid Si surface to ensure a large number of reaction sites for H2 production, and establish intimate contact with Si to facilitate carrier transfer. Finally, an ∼15 nm amorphous TiO2 layer covered on the Pt/n+p-Si using atomic layer deposition results in a superior stability over more than one week of continuous photoelectrochemical testing, while increasing its η to a high value of 10.8% due to the improvement of charge transfer from Pt to the electrolyte. Our findings emphasize the importance of the effective loading of the catalyst and protective layer on the Si photocathode, which subsequently makes the photoelectrochemical process both efficient and stable.
Introduction
Solar-driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is an attractive way to convert intermittent solar irradiation into a storable and green H2 fuel,1–3 where highly efficient and stable semiconductor photoelectrodes are the current research focus to make the PEC process economical. To study the PEC reactivity of a photoelectrode, a three-electrode PEC “half” cell is commonly used, and the solar to chemical conversion efficiency of individual electrodes to drive either the hydrogen or the oxygen evolution reaction can be calculated from their current–voltage curve similar to the case of a solar cell, which allows for optimization of the electrode materials independently. For a photocathode, the intrinsic solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency (η) can be defined as4–7 (1)where Vopversus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. the RHE) is the onset potential measured at a water reduction current density of −1 mA cm−2; E0 is the equilibrium water reduction potential in a 1 M acidic electrolyte (pH = 0), which is 0 V vs. the RHE; JH+/H2 is the current density at E0; FF is the fill factor and Pin is the incident optical power density. To maximize the efficiency, one should maximize all three parameters (JH+/H2, Vop and FF) in the numerator of eqn (1).
Silicon is the most successful material in photovoltaics and ∼20% solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency has been achieved. Currently Si is also being studied as a photocathode for water splitting since its conduction band edge position is more negative than the hydrogen evolution reaction potential for the reduction of water to H2.8–11 It is also highly abundant and low cost and has an ideal bandgap (Eg = 1.12 eV) for absorbing visible sunlight. Recently, researchers have made considerable progress on the PEC properties of Si photocathodes.12–15 However, their η is much lower than those obtained in the corresponding solar cells, even if the most effective catalyst, Pt, for H2 production is used. To date, the highest recorded η of a Pt catalyzed Si photocathode was 13.26% obtained through a Si heterojunction (SiHJ) with two high quality hydrogenated amorphous Si (a-Si:H)/c-Si junctions.6 This record is attributed to the inherent high Vop of 0.64 V vs. the RHE, while the Vop of traditional Pt/n+p-Si is limited to ∼0.56 V vs. the RHE. Note that in photovoltaics, the efficiency of SiHJ solar cells can be up to ∼25%. So, there is no comparison between the η of Pt/SiHJ and Pt/n+p-Si. In addition, the heterojunction Si photocathode is not cost-effective compared to the ordinary n+p-Si, and furthermore the photocathode was found to be stable over 10 h. Kast et al. constructed a Pt/TiO2/F:SnO2/Ti/n+p-Si photocathode, and obtained a high η of ∼10.6%.13 However, only ∼24 h stability is observed. Cabán-Acevedo et al. also obtained a high η of around 10% in Pt/n+pp+-Si, while the stability was not reported. Recently, we have reported that the η of a SiO2 passivated and protected Pt/n+p-Si and a Pt/Al2O3/np+-Si photocathode was ∼8.1% and ∼8.7%, respectively, under 100 mW cm−2 from a Xe lamp with an AM1.5 filter.16,17 In spite of this, it is stable for less than 73 h, due to the loss of Pt from the electrodes. Therefore, there is still room to optimize the JH+/H2, Vop and FF of a Si photocathode to achieve a higher η and it will be better to solve the stability problem simultaneously. The loading of Pt on the electrode surface is one of the key factors. In principle, Pt particles should (1) be small enough to avoid blocking light, mainly for maintaining JH+/H2; (2) be uniformly distributed on the usually uneven electrode surface to maximize the catalytic effect, mainly for increasing Vop and FF; (3) have good contact with Si to let electrons go through the interface freely for lowering the series resistance and thus increasing FF; and (4) adhere to the electrode surface firmly to ensure its stability.
Uniform and small Pt nanoparticles (NPs) can be prepared on a Si surface by a mass-selection process after sputtering a Pt target with Ar+ ions; however, this method is complicated and not cost-effective.18 Electron-beam evaporation of Pt thin films is an attractive approach, always achieving a high η because it yields electrodes with much higher fill factors.12–15 But this technology has the characteristics of high vacuum, a complex system and high processing cost. Electrodeposition is a scalable and low-cost means of depositing Pt NPs on a flat Si surface.19 Unfortunately, large Pt particles (100–200 nm) are easily formed on the light-trapping pyramid Si surface due to its non-uniform electrical properties.16,17 Electroless deposition (ELD) of Pt NPs using Pt salt seems to be the simplest method.20 The size of Pt NPs is typically ∼20 nm.21 Dropping the Pt containing solution onto the Si surface instead of dipping the surface into the solution will be more attractive since we can control and optimize the Pt amount accurately.
In this study, we developed the ELD method for Pt loading to fabricate highly efficient and stable Pt catalyzed n+p-Si photocathodes with a pyramid surface. In particular we (1) use multi-dropping of the Pt-containing solution to optimize the Pt amount; (2) prepare a hydrophilic SiO2/Si surface using an atmospheric plasma oxidation method to obtain uniformly distributed Pt NPs; (3) etch the SiO2 below Pt to establish good Pt/Si contact; and (4) firmly anchor the Pt particles with a TiO2 layer using atomic layer deposition (ALD). As a result, uniformly distributed Pt NPs with sizes of 10–20 nm were directly attached to the n+p-Si surface, leading to a high Vop of 0.56 V vs. the RHE, a JH+/H2 of 34.4 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.56 and finally a high η of 10.8% under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G simulated illumination. In addition, the Si photocathodes show high stability over one week of continuous PEC testing.
Experimental section
Electrodeposition of Pt (e-Pt) and ELD of Pt on the n+p-Si surface
Single-crystalline p-Si wafers (156 × 156 × 0.18 mm3, 1–3 Ω cm specific resistance) were used for this work. The pyramid surface texture was produced by chemical etching in a solution of KOH (Sigma, reagent grade) on a mass production line of crystalline-Si solar cells in the Suzhou company of Canadian Solar Inc. Then, an n+ emitter layer was fabricated on the electrode surface using thermal diffusion of POCl4 at 1000 °C. This n+p-Si structure can boost the photovoltage by replacing the Si/liquid junction with a built-in p–n junction.12 Bottom electrodes were screen-printed onto the rear surface. After drying the screen-printed samples at 150 °C for 5 min to vaporize the organic solvents in the Al paste, an ohmic contact is formed in an infrared conveyor belt furnace at 900 °C for about 13 s. We called such a photocathode n+p-Si. For the fabrication of e-Pt/n+p-Si, the n+p-Si sample was transferred into a solution containing H2PtCl6 (5 mM) (Sigma-Aldrich, reagent grade). Then, the electrode was photo-irradiated at a negative potential (0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl), allowing for the reduction of the Pt salt to Pt metal. The current passing through the working electrode and counter Pt electrode was recorded. The amount of catalyst deposited was monitored by controlling the total deposition charge. As for the fabrication of ELD-Pt/n+p-Si, the aqueous deposition solution of H2PtCl6 was prepared by adding H2PtCl6·6H2O into DI water. In order to eliminate the influence of water in air, the deposition solution was stored in an Ar glovebox. The aqueous H2PtCl6 solution was sonicated for at least 10 min, and then 58 ml of H2PtCl6 aqueous solution was dropped onto the bare n+p-Si or SiO2/n+p-Si surface, where the SiO2 layer on the n+p-Si surface was constructed using an atmospheric plasma oxidation method.16 Finally, they were dried at 373 K in a N2 atmosphere for 0.5 h, forming Pt NPs in the pyramid texture of the Si surface. Concentrations of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 mM H2PtCl6 solution were selected to produce Pt NPs with distribution densities of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 μg cm−2, respectively.
ALD of TiO2
Thin layers of amorphous TiO2 were deposited onto the Si photocathode using a thermal ALD system (Ensure NanoTech, China). TiO2 layers were deposited at a reaction chamber temperature of 150 °C using tetra(dimethylamino)titanium (TDMAT) (99.99%, Aldrich) and high-purity H2O as the Ti and O precursors, respectively. TiO2 layers were deposited in pulse mode under a nitrogen flow of 5 sccm and the growth rate was ∼0.6 Å per cycle at 150 °C. The thickness of the TiO2 film can be regulated by controlling the cycle number. The number of ALD cycles was 250, and a film thickness of ∼15 nm was measured using transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
PEC measurements
PEC measurements were conducted in a three-electrode cell configuration, using the Si photocathode as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) as the reference electrode, and a Pt wire as the counter electrode. The PEC experiments were performed using an electrochemical workstation (Vertex, Ivium Technologies) in a custom-built Teflon electrolytic cell (as shown in Fig. S1†), except for hydrogen quantification measurements. The rear of the Si photocathode is in contact with a spring-loaded Cu plunger which also presses the working electrode against a Teflon gasket. Thus only the active area (∼0.5 cm2) of the Si photocathode touches the electrolyte. The working electrode was illuminated through a fused silica window, using simulated AM1.5G illumination provided by a 300 W Xe lamp (Oriel, Newport Co.) with an AM1.5G filter (Zhao Jiu Photoelectric Technology Co., LTD). During the PEC measurement, the light intensity was carefully maintained at 100 mW cm−2, measured using an optical power meter (Newport company) just before the light entered the PEC cell. All potentials were referenced to the RHE for convenience, according to the following equation:E(RHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + 0.059V × pHwhere E(Ag/AgCl) = 0.197 V. The performance of the photocathodes was measured using linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs) at 50 mV s−1 in a solution containing 1 M HClO4 (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., analytical reagent).
To measure the stability of the photoelectrode, potential vs. time measurements were conducted at a constant current density of −10 mA cm−2 for proton reduction in 1 M HClO4 solution under simulated AM1.5G illumination. The electrolyte was replaced and the sample was rinsed every 24 h during the stability measurements.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed under illumination when the working electrode was biased at a constant potential of 0.56 V vs. the RHE while sweeping the frequency from 300 kHz to 10 Hz with a 10 mV AC dither and modeled using an equivalent circuit. In order to reduce possible complexities at the applied bias and large passing currents, we performed the EIS measurements at a bias close to the Vop.
The hydrogen evolution by PEC water splitting was investigated in an air-tight photo-reactor, which was made of quartz glass.16 The faradaic efficiency of the illuminated photocathodes was determined in a manner similar to the photocurrent measurements at a constant potential of 0 V vs. the RHE and the amount of hydrogen produced was determined using a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (Tianmei, GC 7900T).
Materials characterization
The surface morphology of the sample surface was analyzed using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) (SU8010, Hitachi). In order to avoid surface charging, Au was coated by the sputtering method for 60 s using a BAL-TEC/SCD 005 sputter coater prior to SEM analysis. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was performed using a Tecnai G220 S-TWIN (FEI Company) operating at 200 kV where the specimens for cross-sectional analysis were prepared using an FEI Dual-Beam Helios NanoLab 600i Focused Ion Beam (FIB). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed at room temperature using a PHI-550 ESCA spectrometer (Perkin Elmer) hemispherical analyzer and an Al Kα (hν = 1486.6 eV) X-ray source. The chamber base pressure was typically on the order of 1.0 × 10−9 Torr. The X-ray power was 50 W, and the beam diameter was focused to 200 μm. All the binding energies were referenced to adventitious carbon at 284.6 eV. The reflection spectra of the Si specimens were measured using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 750 spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 300–1100 nm, which uses BaSO4 as a reference. The UV-Vis transmittance spectra of the samples were obtained using a UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu).
Results and discussion
The essence of the idea for this work is presented in Fig. 1, where the stepwise synthetic procedures of two kinds of n+p-Si photocathodes are demonstrated: (1) Pt/n+p-Si with Pt NPs non-uniformly distributed on a pyramid surface (denoted as Pt1/n+p-Si); and (2) Pt/n+p-Si with Pt NPs uniformly distributed (denoted as Pt2/n+p-Si). The fabrication processes of the 15 × 15 mm2 n+p-Si with pyramid surface texture can be found in our previous paper.17,22 Before the ELD of Pt on the Si surface, it was put in a buffered aqueous HF solution (5%) for 15 s to remove the uneven native oxide layer. The Si surface with the native oxide layer is hydrophilic, while the pure Si surface is water-hating, therefore the contact angle is 91.22° (Fig. S2†), indicating that the SiO2 is removed. Therefore, when dropping the H2PtCl6 solution on Si, it will be gathered at the bottom of the pyramid surface texture, as illustrated in the left part of Fig. 1b. Pt has a higher electronegativity than Si, so Pt ions will attract electrons from the Si and be reduced to Pt, while Si will be oxidized to SiO2.23 This process of ELD of Pt NPs on the Si surface can be outlined by the two half-cell reactions: eqn (2) (cathode reaction) and eqn (3) (anode reaction)24 Pt4+ + 4e− → Pt0(s)(2) Si(s) + 2H2O → SiO2 + 4H+ + 4e−(3)
 Fig. 1  Schematic representation of the synthetic procedures of the (a and b) Pt1/n+p-Si, (a, c and d) Pt2/SiO2/n+p-Si and (a and c–e) Pt2/n+p-Si photocathodes. 
As a result, Pt NPs will form at the bottom of the pyramid texture when dried, as illustrated in the right side of Fig. 1b. Note that in Fig. 1b, the Pt loaded Si surface was etched again using the buffered HF solution (5%) for 15 s to remove the SiO2 layer between Pt and the Si substrate. Such a photoelectrode was denoted as Pt1/n+p-Si. Obviously, in this case Pt will not cover the upper part of the pyramid texture, and this is not good for the H2 production. To obtain uniformly distributed Pt on the whole Si surface, we use another roadmap, as described in Fig. 1a–e. A uniform thin SiO2 layer is fabricated on the Si surface using an atmospheric plasma oxidation method.16 Once the H2PtCl6 solution is dropped onto the Si surface, the H2PtCl6 solution will cover the Si surface evenly as indicated in Fig. 1c, since SiO2 is hydrophilic. Then Pt is expected to be uniformly deposited on the Si surface (Fig. 1d) after drying the solution. To remove the redundant SiO2 layer, the electrode is etched using the buffered HF solution to form Pt2/n+p-Si, as illustrated in Fig. 1e.
To confirm the idea of Fig. 1, we present the SEM surface morphology, water wettability and Pt/Si cross-sectional TEM micrographs of the Pt1/n+p-Si, Pt2/n+p-Si, and Pt2/n+p-Si before the etching of SiO2 (denoted as Pt2/SiO2/n+p-Si). Fig. 2a shows that Pt NPs with sizes of 10–20 nm are located at the bottom of the pyramid texture. The contact angle of 99.62° shown in Fig. 2b is large, indicating that the SiO2 is removed. In addition, we can see from Fig. 2c that the Pt NPs establish intimate contact with Si.

Fig. 2d corresponds to the idea of Fig. 1d. As is expected, the small Pt NPs distribute uniformly on the surface of SiO2/n+p-Si. The average diameter of the Pt NPs is still 10–20 nm, much smaller than that produced by the electrodeposition method.19,25 The contact angle in Fig. 2e is 34.53°. Note that the contact angle without Pt NPs is as small as 6.8°. We proposed that Pt is water-hating, and this is also confirmed by the fact that the contact angle (99.62°) of Pt1/n+p-Si is larger than that (91.22°, shown in Fig. S2a†) of bare n+p-Si. The TEM image in Fig. 2f shows that the SiO2 layer obtained by plasma treatment was ∼5 nm which was consistent with our previous report.16
The ∼5 nm SiO2 layer may prevent the photogenerated electrons from leaving the electrode surface, so it is etched using the buffered HF solution (5%) for 15 s. A comparison between Fig. 2d and g shows that the HF solution etching does not change the distribution and size of the Pt NPs, while the contact angle (102.93°) of Pt2/n+p-Si presented in Fig. 2h is much larger than that (34.53°) of Pt2/SiO2/n+p-Si, illustrating the effectiveness of the etching of SiO2 with the HF solution. Furthermore, the SiO2 between Pt and Si is also removed and the Pt NPs establish intimate contact with Si in Pt2/n+p-Si (Fig. 2i). Thus Fig. 2 shows that uniformly distributed Pt NPs with sizes of 10–20 nm can be successfully fabricated on the n+p-Si surface without an interfacial SiO2 layer.
PEC hydrogen evolution was assessed by performing consecutive LSV measurements at 50 mV s−1 in 1 M HClO4 under simulated AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). As we expected, Pt2/n+p-Si has the best PEC performance as shown in Fig. 3. It has Jo = 34.80 mA cm−2, Vop = 0.56 V vs. the RHE and FF = 0.54. In Fig. S3,† we compared the consecutive LSV measurements of the Pt2/n+p-Si electrodes decorated with various amounts of Pt NPs. The photocathode with 1 μg cm−2 Pt NPs exhibits the best performance. Pt1/n+p-Si presents a much smaller FF value of 0.46, indicating that the photogenerated electrons move out of the electrode surface not as smoothly as those in Pt2/n+p-Si. This is because the path for the electrons is concentrated at the bottom of the pyramid texture, and there will be “crowding” when the electrons participate in the H2 production. This leads to the increase of the series resistance and the decrease of FF. For the Pt2/SiO2/n+p-Si photocathode, a negligible photocurrent is observed for H2 generation until the bias potential reaches about −0.35 V vs. the RHE. The photocathode current density at 0 V vs. the RHE is only 6.25 mA cm−2. This illustrates that an ∼5 nm SiO2 layer between the Pt NPs and Si significantly harms its PEC performance, consistent with previously reported literature.16,20,26–28

As mentioned in the introduction, electrodeposition is an attractive means of depositing Pt particles. In order to reveal the advantages of the present ELD method, we also coated Pt on the bare n+p-Si photocathode using a traditional electrodeposition method proposed by Zhou et al.29 The n+p-Si photocathode is decorated with different amounts of Pt catalyst through controlling the deposited charges during the electrochemical deposition. The n+p-Si photocathode with 10.8 μg cm−2 Pt through electrodeposition (e-Pt) exhibits the best performance: a Vop of 0.52 V vs. the RHE, a Jo of 28.5 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.55 (Fig. S4a†). Jo and Vop are obviously lower than 34.6 mA cm−2 and 0.56 V vs. the RHE obtained using the present ELD method. However, the FF is nearly the same. The drop of Jo and Vop may be due to the obtained large Pt particles on the Si surface, as shown in Fig. S4b and c.† The size of the e-Pt particles is not uniform, from several tens to hundreds of nanometers. Large Pt particles will result in optical losses for Si. In Fig. S4d,† the optical properties are explored to investigate the effect of ELD-Pt and e-Pt on the Si surface. The reflectance increases from 10.2% for bare n+p-Si to 12.1% for e-Pt/n+p-Si at 700 nm, while the one for ELD-Pt/n+p-Si is essentially constant compared with that of bare n+p-Si. We propose that this leads to the decrease of light intensity caused by Si in e-Pt/n+p-Si and therefore the decreased Jo and Vop. From Fig. S4c,† we can also see that the e-Pt particles cover all parts of the Si surface from the tip to the base, similar to the case of ELD-Pt on SiO2/Si. This ensures that there are enough active sites for H2 production and effective collection of photogenerated electrons, so the FF of e-Pt/n+p-Si is nearly the same as that of Pt2/n+p-Si.
To study the electrocatalytic properties of the Pt NPs prepared by the electro- and electroless deposition, they were deposited on the conductive flat n++-Si and then LSV tests in the dark were performed. For comparison, the LSV test of bare n++-Si is also carried out. The LSV curve (Fig. S5a†) of pure n++-Si guarantees a negligible H2 evolution reaction (HER) activity, indicating that the observed catalytic activity of the other samples on n++-Si certainly arises from the grown catalyst. The Pt2/n++-Si electrode generates a current density of −10 mA cm−2 at −58 mV vs. the RHE, roughly 27 mV lower than the potential required for the e-Pt/n++-Si electrode (−85 mV). The Tafel slopes, derived from the LSV curves, are illustrated in Fig. S5b† for the assessment of the charge transfer kinetics in the process of catalyzing the HER. The Pt2/n++-Si electrode possesses a lower Tafel slope (36 mV per decade) as compared to the e-Pt/n++-Si electrode (40 mV per decade), further reflecting the improvement of the electrocatalytic activity of Pt2/n++-Si via faster charge transfer kinetics. Note that the Pt NPs prepared by the electro- and electroless deposition on flat n++-Si exhibit morphologies similar to the ones deposited on the n+p-Si substrate (Fig. S5c and d†): e-Pt has larger particles, while ELD-Pt exhibits much smaller ones.
In Fig. S6a,† we present the stability characteristic of the Pt2/n+p-Si. The LSV curve shows no alteration after 10 h of HER testing. However, when the test time increases to 24 h, the LSV curve moves to the left and the FF decreases simultaneously. This may be attributed to two reasons. First, the left-moving of the LSV curve is due to Pt NPs leaving Si after some time of HER testing. Fig. S6b† confirms this point that the number of Pt NPs decreases obviously after 24 h of continuous PEC testing. Second, the n+p-Si surface will be oxidized in the acidic solution due to the presence of oxygen.12 The resulting SiO2 layer beneath Pt will prevent the photogenerated electrons from leaving the Si surface, increase the series resistance of the Si electrode, and finally decrease the FF. We also found that the contact angle of Pt2/n+p-Si after the 24 h HER test decreases obviously from 99.62° to 69.08° (Fig. S6c†), indicating that the hydrophilic SiO2 does form on the Si electrode surface.
Based on the results in Fig. S6,† we conclude that the Pt2/n+p-Si is not stable and special measures are needed to enhance the adhesion of the Pt NPs and to protect the Si surface from oxidation during H2 production. To resolve this issue, a thin TiO2 protective layer produced by the ALD technique was deposited on the top of Pt2/n+p-Si, as illustrated in Fig. 4a. The TiO2 layer is expected to “glue” the Pt NPs. This configuration is confirmed by the cross-sectional TEM image (Fig. 4b). In order to better observe the amorphous TiO2 layer, a thick Ag top layer was deposited before TEM sample preparation. Fig. 4b shows that the Pt NPs come in close contact with the Si surface, while they are surrounded by the TiO2 layer. An additional HRTEM image is given in Fig. S7† to show the microstructure of the Pt NPs more clearly. The thickness of the as-deposited TiO2 layer is ∼15 nm. The Ti 2p XPS spectrum in Fig. 4c shows two peaks at binding energies of 458.9 and 464.7 eV corresponding to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks, respectively, which are consistent with the typical peak values of the Ti4+–O bonds in TiO2.30,31 No signal of Ti3+ was detected in the surface layer. The O 1s spectrum in Fig. 4d also shows two major components. The major peak at a binding energy of 530.4 eV is attributed to O in Ti–O bonds.31 The minor peak at a binding energy of 532.0 eV is attributed to O in Si–O bonds,32 indicating that a small amount of SiOx layer forms on the Si surface during the deposition of the ALD TiO2 overlayer. This phenomenon is consistent with the ALD TiO2 on Si photo-absorber reported by Das et al.33

Fig. 5a shows the comparison of the LSV curve of the working TiO2/Pt2/n+p-Si photocathode with that of Pt2/n+p-Si under chopped simulated illumination. TiO2/Pt2/n+p-Si shows similar performance to Pt2/n+p-Si in LSV measurement: the photocurrent density Jo and onset potential Vop basically remain unchanged. This illustrates that TiO2 is a conductive layer and it is transparent to visible light.34 Linear sweep voltammetry tests with iR correction of Pt2/n++-Si with and without the decoration of the TiO2 layer were performed in order to study the effect of TiO2 layer on the electrocatalytic activity of the Pt NPs. After covering with the TiO2 layer, the LSV curve of Pt2/n++-Si improves slightly from −58 mV to −54 mV vs. the RHE at −10 mA cm−2 (Fig. S8a†). Simultaneously, the Tafel slope also improves from 36 mV per decade to 35 mV per decade (Fig. S8b†). Therefore, covering with the TiO2 layer leads to a small positive impact on the electrocatalytic activity of the Pt NPs. Comparing the UV-Vis transmittance spectra of transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates with and without the decoration of the TiO2 layer, it is confirmed that the TiO2 layer has no absorption in the 300–900 nm wavelength region and it is transparent to visible light (Fig. S9†). The reflection spectra of the Pt2/n+p-Si sample also show no significant difference after the loading of the TiO2 layer, indicating that a thin TiO2 layer will not affect the light absorption of the Si electrode (Fig. S10†). In addition, numerous studies have shown that a TiO2 thin layer can efficiently suppress carrier recombination on the Si surface by surface state passivation;31,33,35 therefore, the FF of the TiO2/Pt2/n+p-Si photocathode increases to 0.56, compared to that (0.54) of Pt2/n+p-Si. The results of Fig. 5 are also consistent with reported results that indicate that Pt NPs separated from the aqueous electrolyte by a TiO2 layer of more than 15 nm still well catalyze surface photoelectrochemical hydrogen production without maintaining direct contact with the electrolyte.36
 Fig. 5  (a) LSV curves under chopped illumination and (b) Nyquist impedance plots of the Pt2/n+p-Si (black) and TiO2/Pt2/n+p-Si (red) photoelectrodes measured in 1 M HClO4 solution under simulated AM1.5G illumination. The solid line traces in (b) correspond to the fitting using the inset equivalent circuit. 
To provide more insights into the PEC performance, we performed EIS to elucidate the charge-transfer resistances (Rct) in the Pt2/n+p-Si and TiO2/Pt2/n+p-Si photocathodes. In Fig. 5b, the Nyquist impedance plots of the two photocathodes both display two distinguishable semicircles. The data can be fitted to an equivalent circuit (Fig. 5b inset) following reported examples of catalyst-semiconductor systems.37,38 The charge transfer resistance across the absorber–catalyst interface (Rct,Si) is a good indicator of the coupling between the light absorber and the catalyst. As shown in the left semicircle in Fig. 5b and S11,† the Rct,Si (∼6.5 Ω cm2) is quite small for both Pt2/n+p-Si and TiO2/Pt2/n+p-Si, suggesting the good contact for achieving high-quality interfaces between the absorber Si and catalyst Pt, and the presence of TiO2 does not affect the Pt/Si contact. Furthermore, the second semicircle on the right leads to the charge transfer resistance from the catalyst to the electrolyte (Rct,Pt), which usually reflects the catalytic activity of the material. TiO2/Pt2/n+p-Si shows a smaller Rct,Pt (47.3 Ω cm2) compared to Pt2/n+p-Si (53.1 Ω cm2). This again illustrates that the TiO2 layer on Pt2/n+p-Si improves the catalytic activity of the Pt NPs. This may be due to the following two factors: (1) the TiO2 layer passivates the n+p-Si surface, which deceases the carrier recombination in the photoelectrode; (2) the TiO2 on the top of Pt is not as thick as that on Si, and the top surfaces of some Pt NPs with sizes larger than ∼15 nm are not fully covered by TiO2, as can be seen more clearly in Fig. S12.† This is because it is difficult to nucleate on the water-hating Pt surface during the ALD process where an H2O-containing Ti source is used, while the Si surface is easily oxidized and becomes hydrophilic. This leads to an overall increase of Pt catalytic activity and the reduction of Rct,Pt. As a result, the η of the TiO2/Pt2/n+p-Si photocathode reaches a value of 10.8% according to eqn (1). To the best of our knowledge, this performance is among the best reported ones for Si photocathodes.
TiO2 is a promising candidate for use as a protective layer on Si photoelectrodes due to its corrosion-resistance properties in the electrolyte.39,40 To explore the durability of the TiO2/Pt2/n+p-Si photocathode under operating conditions, we performed potential vs. time measurements in 1 M HClO4 solution. The TiO2/Pt2/n+p-Si photocathode was able to maintain a photocurrent of −10 mA cm−2 for ∼168 h without the sign of decay in PEC activity, indicating superior stability of the TiO2 layer in 1 M HClO4 solution and good adhesion of the TiO2 layer and Pt on Si. To check this point, we also performed TEM measurement of the sample TiO2/Pt2/n+p-Si after the 168 h electrolysis. Fig. S13† shows clearly the presence of Pt nanoparticles on the Si surface similar to Fig. 4b, indicating that a thin layer of TiO2 is effective in “gluing” the Pt NPs.
The inset in Fig. 6a shows the detailed potential vs. time data of the TiO2/Pt2/n+p-Si photocathode for the first 5 h. The small fluctuation of the potential can be attributed to the nucleation and release of H2 bubbles on the electrode surface.41 The LSV tests in Fig. 6b again show that the TiO2/Pt2/n+p-Si photocathode has nearly no loss in performance after 168 h of PEC testing. As shown in Fig. S14,† we also performed H2 quantification measurements to confirm that the photocathode selectively evolves H2. The H2 amounts obtained from the theoretical calculation and actual measurement are determined to be very close, with a faradaic efficiency of ∼96%.
 Fig. 6  High stability of the TiO2/Pt2/n+p-Si photocathode. (a) Potential vs. time data at a constant current density of −10 mA cm−2 in 1 M HClO4 solution. The inset shows the detailed potential fluctuation during the first 5 h. (b) Consecutive LSV measurements of the TiO2/Pt2/n+p-Si photocathode before (0 h) and after (168 h, one week) PEC testing. 
In previous studies, Si photocathodes were first covered with protective layers such as TiO2 and Al2O3, and then catalysts such as Pt were deposited on the protected Si surface to remove the bottleneck of water reduction kinetics.39,42 However, this strategy may not be beneficial for constructing a highly stable photocathode since the catalyst can leave the Si surface during the drastic PEC water splitting. The best reported stability is about 72 h for a Pt/TiO2/n+p-Si structure.39 Obviously, our current TiO2/Pt/n+p-Si structure has far superior stability and higher efficiency compared to traditional ones. In short, we ascribe such superiority to (1) the uniform distribution of Pt NPs with an optimal amount for the HER; (2) the direct contact of Pt and Si; (3) the “gluing” effect of the TiO2 layer on the Pt NPs; and (4) the passivation effect of the amorphous ALD TiO2 layer with suitable thickness. To check the final point, we also tried a thinner TiO2 layer with a thickness of about 2 nm. The PEC performance is better than that of the 15 nm layer, with η up to 11% (Fig. S15†). This may be due to fewer Pt NPs fully covered by TiO2. However, the stability is only about 64 h. This indicates that we need to find a balance between the thickness of TiO2 and the high η and stability.
Conclusions
We developed an ELD method for Pt loading to fabricate a highly efficient and stable Pt catalyzed n+p-Si photocathode with a pyramid surface through (1) using multi-dropping of the Pt-containing solution to optimize the Pt amount; (2) fabricating a hydrophilic SiO2/Si surface to obtain uniformly distributed Pt NPs; (3) etching the SiO2 below Pt to establish good Pt/Si contact; and (4) depositing a TiO2 covering layer to firmly anchor the Pt NPs. Uniformly distributed Pt NPs with sizes of 10–20 nm were directly attached to the n+p-Si surface, which are “glued” by an ∼15 nm TiO2 layer. Under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G simulated illumination, a high Vop of 0.56 V vs. the RHE, a JH+/H2 of 34.8 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.56 and finally a high η of 10.8% along with a superior stability over more than one week of continuous PEC testing were obtained with an optimized Pt amount of only 1 μg cm−2 loaded on the electrode surface.
