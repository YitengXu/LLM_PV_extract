    , Accepted 19th November 2016First published on 21st November 2016AbstractIn this review article, the important features (optical, thermal and electrochemical) of triphenylamine (TPA) based organic hole transport materials (HTMs) in accordance with their structural diversities are discussed from their evolution to recent advancements. The literature here covers past and ongoing work mostly relevant to HTMs used in DSSCs and PSCs. Besides the good optical properties and high hole mobility, the stability of the amorphous state of the HTM layer is a crucial factor in the commercialization of PSCs. The stability of the amorphous glassy state of HTMs is defined by an important physical parameter, i.e., the glass transition temperature (Tg) which is discussed on the basis of the molecular structure of HTMs.Pooja AgarwalaDr Pooja Agarwala is a Scientist, in the research group of Prof. Dinesh Kabra at the Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai, India.

1. Introduction
In 1968, Gerischer et al. investigated the sensitization effects at different semiconductor surfaces by electrochemical methods.1 The studies were based on Mulder's2 work together with some earlier comments3 on the mechanisms of spectral sensitization of semiconductors by organic dyes for electrical conductivity. Based on these preliminary findings, Brian O'Regan and Michael Grätzel co-invented a photoelectrochemical system, Dye Sensitized Solar Cell (DSSC) in 1991 (Fig. 1a),4 which became a huge breakthrough in the field of sustainable, clean and renewable energy. A ruthenium complex-based photosensitizer was adsorbed on nanoporous TiO2 film and iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) was used as a redox shuttle, and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7% was achieved.4 Over two decades, PCE of DSSCs has improved consistently by the optimization of large band gap semiconductors,5–25 sensitizers26–57 and electrolytes.58–82 To date, the record PCE of DSSCs has reached 13% by employing a metal complex redox couple-Co(II/III)tris(bipyridyl) in conjunction with a zinc-porphyrin dye83 but the instability of these devices (DSSCs) still remains a challenge. The liquid electrolyte used in DSSCs shows intolerance towards temperature variation and causes degradation of device performance in due course of time.84 Over the last two decades, the major ongoing research in the area of photovoltaics has been focused on replacing liquid electrolytes by solid ones (Hole Transport Materials (HTMs)).

For the first time cuprous iodide (CuI) and cuprous thiocyanate (CuSCN) were used as hole conductors replacing the redox electrolyte and achieved PCEs exceeding 1%.85,86 With cuprous bromide (CuBr)87 and nickel oxide (NiO),88 moderate PCEs of 3% were observed. But due to the easy crystallization and poor solubility of these materials, the devices were found to be highly unstable and the reproducibility became dubious. It left the issues related to liquid electrolyte based DSSCs unresolved. In 1998, Bach and Grätzel reported cells based on a spirobisfluorene-connected arylamine hole transmitter (spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxy-phenyl-amine)9,9′-spirobifluorene)), which displayed a particularly noteworthy open-circuit voltage (Voc) exceeding 0.9 V and have reached a conversion efficiency of 2.56%.89 But the problems related to poor pore filling and fast charge recombination of spiro-OMeTAD remained unsettled. In 2001, Kaiser et al. reported extremely thin absorber (ETA) solar cells which are conceptually close to dye-sensitized heterojunctions.90 In these devices the molecular dye is replaced by an extremely thin (2–3 nm) layer of a small-band-gap semiconductor, such as copper indium sulphide (CuInS2) and the hole conductor, for instance, CuSCN placed on top of it. The PCEs of such devices remained below 5%.91 After comprehensive research efforts made in this area, the record efficiency of ssDSSCs reached up to 7.2% which was reported by Nazeeruddin and co-workers in 2011.92 For the first time a cobalt(III) complex (FK102) was studied as a p-type dopant for an organic HTM (spiro-OMeTAD) and effectively enhanced the conductivity from 4.4 × 10−5 to 5.3 × 10−4 S cm−1.92 In 2012, Kanatzidis and co-workers reported the first study on employing cesium tin iodide (CsSnI3, a type of perovskite) as an inorganic p-type semiconductor for ssDSSCs and achieved a high PCE of 8.5% in conjunction with a ruthenium dye (N719) as the photosensitizer.93 Exceptionally high hole mobility of 585 cm2 V−1 s−1 and excellent solubility in organic solvents made CsSnI3 a desirable candidate as an HTM. There have been more reports in recent years where CsSnI3 has been used as an HTM in combination with different inorganic and organic sensitizers.94,95 Despite the fact that CsSnI3 suggested promising results as an inorganic HTM, its sensitivity towards oxygen and moisture is the biggest drawback of this material.96
To address the issues of incomplete pore filling and fast electron–hole recombination of spiro-OMeTAD97–100 to some extent it is desirable to keep TiO2 mesoporous film as thin as possible. But thin mesoporous TiO2 film obstructs the adsorption of dye molecules which impedes the visible light absorption by the photoanode due to the low molar extinction coefficient (∼103 M−1 cm−1) of dyes. To employ spiro-OMeTAD the maximum thickness of the nanoporous TiO2 active layer for ssDSSCs was optimized to be 2.0 μm, which is too thin to obtain good light absorption.97–100 Employment of the new photosensitizers with high molar extinction coefficients in ssDSSCs was the obvious solution to fix this issue.96 Following the same path, Miyasaka and co-workers in 2009 (ref. 101) reported the very first incorporation of organometallic lead halide perovskites (CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbBr3) as the light-harvesting active layer into DSSCs while banking on their high molar extinction coefficient of 105 M−1 cm−1.102 The efficiency obtained was 3.8% when CH3NH3PbI3 was used as the photosensitizer in combination with the iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−)-based liquid electrolyte.101 Although efficiency was improved further up to 6.5% by N.-G. Park et al., the device was yet again found to be extremely unstable.103 In 2012 Moser et al.49 and Snaith et al.50 achieved high PCEs exceeding 10% by replacing the liquid electrolytes with the solid-state hole transport material, i.e., spiro-OMeTAD in perovskite based solar cells (PSCs) (Fig. 1b). To date the largely used structure of PSCs is similar to that of ssDSSCs which is composed of a transparent and conductive fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) layer with compact TiO2 deposited onto it, an additional nanostructured mesoporous TiO2 layer for perovskite penetration, a thin layer of perovskite covered with HTM and finally the gold electrode makes the top most covering. The working principle is somewhat different than that of DSSCs. In DSSCs, the dye generates an exciton on optical excitation which gets ionized by transferring the electron to TiO2 and dye molecules get oxidized. These electrons get transported in the external circuit and reach the counter electrode. From the counter electrode, these photo-induced electrons get transported through the HTM and regenerate the dye molecules. Under constant illumination, this process generates an electrical current in the external circuit,92 whereas in PSCs, there is direct generation of free charge carriers on optical excitation of the perovskite, the electrons are hauled out at the TiO2/perovskite interface leaving the holes behind and transported towards FTO. Simultaneously, the holes are extracted by HTM at the perovskite/HTM interface and transported towards the gold electrode. Though there is a different working principle of HTMs in these two kinds of solar cells, there is a common criterion of having a high conductivity of HTMs for efficient light to electricity conversion process. In recent years organometallic halide perovskite compounds have attracted significant attention due to their high intrinsic carrier mobility values reaching surprisingly as high as 7–30 × 103 cm2 V−1 s−1 for electrons and 1.5–5.5 × 103 cm2 V−1 s−1 for holes.102,105–107 Their long electron diffusion length in the range of 130–1069 nm, the hole diffusion length of 100–1213 nm (ref. 108) and the tunable absorption over most of the visible spectrum have made this material applicable to many kinds of optoelectronic devices. Of late, studies on structural, morphological, optical, and electrical properties of a wide variety of mixed perovskite systems with the band gap tuned in the range from 2.42 to 3.16 eV have been published in context with OLEDs.109,110 Tremendous progress has been made in different aspects of PSCs and the highest certified record PCE of 22.1% for a single-junction perovskite solar cell has been reported by researchers from KRICT and UNIST in March 2016.104 As PSCs are the new generation solar cells which showed incredible progress within a short span of 3–4 years, researchers are working on both the active layer as well as hole transporting layer rigorously.49,50,105–107
In pursuit of new inorganic HTMs for PSCs, Kamat et al. identified CuI, which had been earlier explored in DSSCs,85 as a possible alternative HTM for PSCs.111 The FF was higher than that of spiro-OMeTAD based PSCs which was revealed to be due to the 2 orders of magnitude higher electrical conductivity of CuI than spiro-OMeTAD.111 Overall PCE of 6.0% with excellent photocurrent stability was achieved. Later, Grätzel and M. K. Nazeeruddin attempted the solution processable deposition of CuSCN as a HTM in CH3NH3PbI3 based solar cells and demonstrated high efficiency of 12.4%.112 Excellent transparency throughout the visible and near infrared spectrum, hole mobility of 0.01–0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 and good chemical stability113–116 are some of the prominent characteristics exhibited by CuSCN. The device was composed of the structure FTO/compact TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 (double deposition)/CuSCN/Au and the champion device displayed a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 19.7 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.016 V and FF of 0.62.112 Sarkar et al. explored the hole conductivity of electrodeposited NiO in conjunction with CH3NH3PbI3−xClx and displayed power conversion efficiency of 7.3%.117 Owing to the high hole mobility of 256 cm2 V−1 s−1, Cu2O constitutes a promising HTM.118 Moreover, Cu2O provides a shield to the perovskite and prevents its exposure to moisture.118,119 Recently a high efficiency of 8.93% has been realized by the incorporation of Cu2O in PSCs.119 In 2015 Yang et al. showed the high efficacy of kesterite-structured quaternary semiconductor Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) nanoparticles as a novel inorganic HTM for organo-lead halide PSCs for the very first time.120 PCE of 12.75% was achieved which was suggested as a result of improved interfacial contact between the perovskite layer and Au electrode and consequent prohibition of electron–hole recombination. Further analysis of SEM images disclosed that the filling of CZTS nanoparticles into perovskite pores assists in smoothing the perovskite film.
Another category of inorganic HTMs which is transition metal oxides (such as WO3, MoO3, and V2O5) satisfy the requirements of chemical and thermal stability121–124 but the efficiency has not yet touched the one optimized with other inorganic HTMs.120 An additional limitation with transition-metal-oxide HTMs is that the thickness must be controlled within a few nanometers in order to avoid high series resistance,125 due to which these materials do not provide complete coverage when used on perovskite layers with rough surfaces.126–128 The band gaps of inorganic and transition metal oxide HTMs are illustrated as per the literature93–125 in Fig. 1c. Even after a moderate progress and the efforts which have been invested for the development of suitable inorganic HTMs, organic HTMs stand high in both DSSC and PSC applications due to their unique advantages, i.e., countless range, good stability, solution-processability and possibility of tuning the electronic and mechanical properties via molecular engineering.96 A vast variety of organic HTMs has been studied for optoelectronic devices which are based on different electron donor moieties. Carbazole,129–132 phenothiazine,133 pyrene134 and triphenylamine (TPA)135–138 are some of the most investigated ones in organic HTMs. There are several structural strategies adopted for the development of organic HTMs in contemplation of procuring high charge carrier mobility, tuning of the oxidation potentials, improved film forming capacity and high solubility for good pore filling capability.96,139–141 Schematic diagrams of some of the molecular designs (linear, star shaped and spiro-linked), which will be discussed in later sections of this article, are shown in Fig. 2. The morphology of HTM films relies on specific properties unveiled by different molecular designs (Fig. 2) and possesses utmost significance in controlling the performance and stability of devices. The amorphous glassy state is the most desirable for different optoelectronic applications due to its advantage of easy formation, absence of grain boundaries and spatial homogeneity leading to enhanced reproducibility of device performance.142,143 The molecular design has a direct impact on an important physical parameter, that is, glass transition temperature (Tg) which indicates the stability of the amorphous state of a given material.144,145 Since most of the optoelectronic devices operate at higher temperatures than room temperature and sustaining the amorphous state throughout is important for device performance and stability, a high Tg is crucial.144,145

The role of the active material/HTM interface plays an important role in showing the change in PL by transferring the hole to HTM and electron to ETL. However, reviewing it for a large range of HTM layers for a big family of perovskites (MAPbX3, FAPbX3, CsPbX3 with mixed halide & mixed molecular ion ions) and a much larger family of dyes can be pretty extensive. Hence we kept it out of scope of this present review. Our focus is to summarize the literature on triphenylamine (TPA) based hole transporting amorphous glasses, specifically, linear, starburst and spiro-structured HTMs with their molecular developments and applications in DSSCs and PSCs. The initial section provides a brief discussion on different types of inorganic HTMs and their drawbacks. Then the attention is shifted to the main focus of the article which is the evolution and molecular engineering of organic HTMs. A concise description about the characteristics of amorphous molecules, different structural approaches for TPA based hole conducting molecules and evolution of spiro structures from linear molecular designs is given. Every section gives a comprehensive overview on currently adapted approaches of molecular engineering in order to tune the band gap and enhance device performance. Thermal, electrochemical and device data of the HTMs which could be retrieved from the literature are discussed in relevant sections and also compiled in tabular forms (Tables 1 and 2). This review studies numerous TPA-based organic HTMs with different molecular structures, stability, optical and electrochemical properties and aims to provide an immaculate picture of the progress in this field.

2. Evolution of triphenylamine (TPA) based HTMs
This section emphasizes on the foremost characteristics of organic HTMs which are necessary for their applications in optoelectronic devices, in addition to a concise overview of the evolution of TPA based molecular glasses. It elaborates the significance of triphenylamine (TPA) as a vital elementary unit of organic HTMs and some of the non-TPA HTMs are also briefed at the end.
2.1. Desirable characteristics of HTMs for optoelectronic applications
One of the main causes of rapid degradation of the devices based on organic hole transport materials is the conversion of their metastable amorphous state into a thermodynamically stable polycrystalline state due to thermal stress during the operation of the device. When the operating temperature is higher than the Tg of HTM, the molecular motions increase and the transition into the crystalline state is favoured. This leads to the formation of grain boundaries between polycrystallites which are capable of entrapping the charge carriers143,144 that finally directs to demolition of device performance. That is why, the main focus of the researchers has been on developing low molecular weight organic materials with high Tg's. These compounds are referred to as amorphous molecular glasses which maintain their amorphous state at room temperature as well as under the working conditions of the device.146 This amorphous glassy state is advantageous for reproducibility of the device characteristics and enhancing the optical properties of the material which would be compromised due to a large amount of light scattering by polycrystalline materials.143,144 Naito and Miura studied that there is an association between the molecular structure and stability of the amorphous state of HTMs.144,145 High Tg's as well as low ionization potentials (IPs) are the prerequisites for using these materials in optoelectronic devices so that the hole injection barrier from the transparent anode can be minimized.148–151
2.2. Different approaches for designing molecules with required characteristics
As regards to the topology, molecular glasses may exist in different conformations which were touched upon in the earlier section (Sec. 1) (Fig. 2). Holmes and Shirota introduced simple methods of designing conjugated linear polymers and structures of relatively low molecular weights in order to achieve stable amorphous states.148–151 There are several reports on the utilization of low molecular weight amorphous compounds with Tg's above the room temperature (∼130 °C)152–154 as linear HTMs used in light-emitting devices (LEDs). Shirota further improvised the design of these molecular glasses and introduced starburst molecules with other co-workers155,156 in order to achieve higher Tg's and highly stable amorphous states. According to Shirota,157 a non-planar structure of a molecule could prevent easy packing of molecules and hence produces amorphous films with high Tg. Auxiliary features can be attained by incorporating bulky substituents which hinder translational, rotational and vibrational motions of molecules and assist in achieving high stability of the films in devices.157 Another approach presumed by Salbeck158 was based on the introduction of spiro centers into defined low molecular structures while the electronic properties were still retained. Such modifications result in rigid structures with higher molecular weight and high steric demand which lead to the elevated morphological stability of HTM and longevity of the device.158 The resulting bulky spiro structure facilitates in impeding the diffusion between adjacent layers in a multilayer EL device.144,145 Among all the molecular conformations, the spiro structure (Fig. 2iii) with a spirobifluorene core (Fig. 11b)147 has been utilized most extensively due to its high Tg (121–273 °C) and the optimum hole conductivity (10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1).159,160
2.3. TPA as a building block of HTMs
In 1976, Alan MacDiarmid, Hideki Shirakawa, and Alan J. Heeger discovered conducting organic polymers and explored the doping of these polymers over a full range from an insulator to a metal.161,162 After this innovation the organic materials were deemed as potential candidates for organic optoelectronics.163 Gradual rise in understanding of the electronic properties of these materials led to the discovery of amazing electronic properties and applications of phenylamine compounds. Exhibiting a remarkable charge transporting property, phenylamines have been of great interest as hole transporting materials in organic electroluminescent devices.164,165 Polymers containing these moieties are more easily processable and offer enhanced mechanical properties. There is a huge range of non-conjugated polymers of di- and triphenylamine which are synthesized and used efficiently as HTMs in organic electroluminescent devices. Although conjugated polymers comprising diphenylamine and triphenylamine are rare, polyaniline (PANI) is the only well recognized conjugated diphenylamine polymer as it is highly electrically conductive and environmentally stable in the doped state.166 Later triphenylamine (TPA) conjugated polymers were also synthesized in 1991 by Ni-catalyzed coupling polymerization.167
TPA based HTMs exhibit good thermal and morphological stability, good charge transport and suitable IPs. The TPA unit has been widely applied and studied in various optoelectronic materials used for DSSCs,168–188 PSCs,135,148,189–193 OLEDs194,195 and organic field effect transistors (OFETs).196,197 It is a good electron donor unit198 which possesses two basic properties: easy oxidizability of the amine nitrogen atom and the ability to transport positive charge efficiently.199 Many of the aromatic amines are hole transporting materials where the electron donating amine nitrogen atom is responsible for the hole transporting behaviour.199 The low IP of aromatic amines varies with different substituents200 and assists in the formation of cation radicals. To date there are only a few HTMs based on non-amine derivatives reported as efficient as amine based derivatives (TTF-1 1, P3HT 2, DR3TBDTT 3, HTM 2a 4, HTM 2b 5, HTM 2c 6, HTM 1 7) (Fig. 3).201–203 The IPs of this category of organic HTMs have been shown in Fig. 1c. The triphenylamine (TPA) compounds are rigorously investigated as HTMs in ssDSSCs and PSCs in the form of small-molecules as well as oligomer-molecules. TPA possesses pseudo-3D conjugated architecture which acts as a building block in the construction of HTMs.204 Due to its propeller conformation in HTMs, the close contact between perovskites and HTMs is prevented in PSCs, consequently reducing the charge recombination.191 In the following sections we will be discussing different forms of TPA based oligomer-molecules on the ground of conformations specified in Fig. 2.

3. Linear oligomeric triphenylamines as HTMs
The formation of big linear oligomers in order to improve the stability and the role of molecular engineering with recent literature on the application of these organic HTMs in DSSCs and PSCs are elaborated here.
Okada et al. demonstrated the role of oligomerization of TPA 8 in producing the hole transporting molecules with high Tg's.205 They reported the dimer (TPD 9), trimer (TPTR 10), tetramer (TPTE 11) and pentamer (TPPE 12) of TPA with the aid of Ullmann coupling reaction between the corresponding primary or secondary arylamines and aryl iodides (Fig. 4a). Thermal properties of the oligomeric TPAs were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The Tg's of the whole series of oligomers were found to be in the range of characteristic properties of amorphous materials. It was observed that the value of Tg shifted to a high temperature as the number of TPA units increased. The Tg for TPTR 10 was observed as 95 °C, 130 °C for TPTE 11 and 145 °C for TPPE 12 and are much higher than that of TPD 9 (Tg = 60 °C).205–207 No morphological changes were observed in the films even at 100 °C which is completely attributed to Tg's reaching higher than 100 °C with oligomerization. Durrant et al. later demonstrated the effect of different polymerization degrees on the hole mobility of the HTMs which increases with increase in the number of TPA units (Fig. 4b).208 They developed a series of TPA-based linear oligomers (HTM1 to HTM6 (13–18)). Hole mobility improved from 4.86 × 10−4 to 1.04 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 as the TPA units increased from 3 to 18.208

3.1. Molecular engineering and recent developments
Based on the preliminary studies conducted by Okada and co-workers,205,208 progress in linear HTMs is achieved by playing with the number of oligomer units, incorporation of different substituents at different positions, side chain introduction, heteroatom insertion and elongation of olefinic bonds. This section covers some of the recent structural developments in linear HTMs and their suitability in terms of device performance.

3.1.1. Effect of methoxy substituents on TPA units. 
Xu et al. investigated organic hole transport materials MeO-TPD 19, MeO-TPTR 20 and MeO-TPTE 21 (Fig. 5a) bearing methoxy substituents on triphenylamine units of TPD 9, TPTR 10, and TPTE 11 in ssDSSCs.209,210 The electron donating methoxy group could assist in lowering the oxidation potentials of MeO-based linear oligomer series in comparison with their non-methoxy analogues.211 The power conversion efficiencies achieved were 4.4%, 5.0% and 5.8% under 1 sun with MeO-TPD 19, MeO-TPTR 20 and MeO-TPTE 21, respectively. MeO-TPTE 21 outperformed the ssDSSC based on spiro-OMeTAD 68 (5.4%) which has been suggested due to the slim molecular structure of MeO-TPTE 21 to be useful in improving pore filling in the TiO2 electrode.212 The Tg's were determined to be 71.2 °C for MeO-TPD 19, 110 °C for MeO-TPTR 20 and 137.2 °C for MeO-TPTE 21, which certainly show the influence of incorporation of oligomerization units. The hole drift mobility also improved in a similar manner as it was 6.19 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for MeO-TPD 19, 19.82 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for MeO-TPTR 20 and 1.47 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for MeO-TPTE 21.

3.1.2. Role of alkyl chains in improving pore filling capability. 
In 2012, McGehee et al. showed that the introduction of long alkyl chains into the HTM molecular structure significantly improves the solubility of HTMs which in turn leads to better pore infiltration of the device.213 Two small organic HTMs named AS37 22 and AS44 23 (chemical structures shown in Fig. 5b) were designed, synthesized and studied in ssDSSCs in conjunction with the dye Z907. HTM AS37 22 can be considered as a half of spiro-OMeTAD 68 with two hexyl chains in place of the central spiro-link, whereas the spiro-bridge was replaced by a carbazole core in AS44 23. These molecules demonstrated relatively low Tg's and Tm's (AS37 22: Tg = 43 °C, Tm = 106 °C, AS44 23: Tg = 59 °C, Tm = 132 °C). The performance of devices based on HTM AS44 23 exhibited higher PCE than that of the spiro-OMeTAD 68-based device with the same composition. It has been suggested that the high solubility resulted in appreciably improved pore filling in thick devices, and consequently improved photovoltaic performance.213


3.1.3. Role of heteromolecules in TPA-based linear oligomers. 
Li et al. reported a new simple HTM H101 24 which incorporates a 3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) unit as the core structure in between two TPAs (Fig. 5c).214 They showed promising results when H101 24 was used in PSCs in conjunction with CH3NH3PbI3. EDOT plays a vital role in increasing the mobility and tuning the band gap (HOMO level −5.16 eV, which is 50 mV higher than that of spiro-OMeTAD (−5.21 eV)), leading to the high current density (Jsc) with the power conversion efficiency reaching up to 10.9% without doping and 13.8% with doping. This work has revealed the scope to introduce suitable heterocyclic units into the linear HTM structures with much simpler chemistry and lower cost. Added to the above mentioned benefits, the smaller molecular size of H101 24 is synergistically beneficial in the infiltration and effective pore-filling. The Tg of H101 24 is found to be much lower (around 78 °C) than that of spiro-OMeTAD 68 (125 °C), which puts up a question mark on the stability of the device. The issue of low Tg of H101 24 has been resolved recently by Docampo et al. by synthesizing EDOT-OMeTPA 25 by incorporating an azomethine linkage between TPA and EDOT units of H101 24 (Fig. 5c).215 A more planar conformation and highly ordered conjugation of the azomethine-based backbone increased the stability and aligned the energy level with the perovskite material. The Tg (105 °C) of EDOT-OMeTPA 25 was found to be increased by 27 °C in comparison with H101 24 (78 °C) which is again dedicated to the more planar conformations of EDOT-OMeTPA 25. PSCs with EDOT-OMeTPA 25 as the hole transporting layer show power conversion efficiencies exceeding 11% without doping and good stability over 1000 hours with very little degradation in the PCE (∼10%) when stored at room temperature and a relative humidity of 30%.


3.1.4. Incorporation of olefinic bonds in TPA-based linear oligomers. 
Wang et al.191 interpreted the influence of the number of olefinic bonds on the properties of TPA-based linear oligomers. Novel small-structured HTMs with a linear π-conjugated structure based on a diphenyl (DP) unit and a TPA unit, linked with olefinic bonds, were explored for their thermal stability, hole mobility and photovoltaic activity. Three synthesized HTMs namely 2TPA-2-DP 26, 2TPA-3-DP 27 and 2TPA-4-DP 28 (Fig. 5c) were found to be promising in different types of electronic devices. Hole-drift mobilities of 2TPA-2-DP 26, 2TPA-3-DP 27 and 2TPA-4-DP 28 were calculated as 1.09 × 10−4, 8.39 × 10−5 and 6.79 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The lowest hole mobility of 2TPA-4-DP 28 indicates that the extension of the conjugated system could impede charge carrier transportation due to the loss of planarity in the molecule.192 2TPA-n-DP (n = 2, 3, 4) displayed high decomposition temperatures (Td, in the range of 367–409 °C) and high glass transition temperatures (Tg = 102 °C, 164 °C and 158 °C for 2TPA-2-DP 26, 2TPA-3-DP 27, 2TPA-4-DP 28, respectively) suggesting the exceptional thermal stability and efficacy of these compounds in solar cells. The PSCs based on 2TPA-2-DP 26 as the HTM exhibit an encouraging power conversion efficiency of 9.1% under AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) illuminations. Promising results of 2TPA-2-DP 26 persuaded Zhu et al. to explore it with different device parameters.216 They considered three different thicknesses of mesoporous TiO2 film as 300, 500 and 800 nm for the experiment. A PCE of up to 12.96% with 2TPA-2-DP 26 was achieved with 500 nm thickness of meso-TiO2 which is comparable to those of devices with spiro-OMeTAD 68 as the HTM under similar conditions.216 Further, the charge separation and charge collection processes were studied by time-resolved PL decay measurements. It has been observed that the PL quenching time reduced from 103.73 to 8.52 ns which indicated effective quenching of photogenerated excitons at the perovskite/2TPA-2-DP 26 interface and signified an excellent charge transfer ability of 2TPA-2-DP 26.216
It can be recapitulated with the literature findings in this section that the judicious modulations in the basic skeleton of linear organic HTMs can empower them to the best of their characteristics and establish them as a potential class of organic HTMs for PSCs. Their slim molecular design is an additional feature which could be beneficial in achieving excellent pore filling capability. Further we move to another class of organic oligomeric HTMs, which is, starburst molecular glasses.

4. Starburst molecules as HTMs
In order to prevent easy reorientation and consequent crystallization of the molecules, non-planar oligomers were adopted. Due to their starlike appearance these branched oligomers are termed as starburst molecules and exhibit much higher stability of the amorphous state than their linear equivalents. It had been observed by Moll et al.217 that the linear TDATA 29 possesses high crystallization capability and crystallises even in the common solvents and showed very poor solubility, whereas its nonplanar counterpart TDATA (S) 30 (Fig. 6a) exhibited Tg of 89 °C (ref. 218) and showed much higher stability than TDATA 29. Due to their particular design, starburst molecules are more opportune than linear molecules to undergo several molecular modifications and offer a broader range of HTMs with different characteristics. In this section we aim to cover most of the molecular modulations with some of the latest research in this class of organic HTMs.

4.1. Alkyl substituted starburst molecules
In order to create a bulky periphery to avoid easy packing of the molecules, placement of alkyl groups at the phenyl rings of TPA units was adopted as an easy technique. Although the alkyl substituted starburst molecules form stable amorphous films, the glass transition temperatures (Tg) of these materials were observed to get reduced in comparison with non-substituted molecules. Noma et al.218 introduced a methyl group at the meta position of the phenyl ring in MTDATA 31 (Fig. 6a). But the Tg of MTDATA 31 was lowered by 6 °C when compared to that of its non-alkylated analogue (TDATA (S) 30). TPTE (S) 32, a branched form of TPTE 11 showed the ability to form stable glassy films on glass substrates by vacuum deposition. Although these films were also found to be stable up to 100 °C, Tg of TPTE (S) 32 (106 °C) was observed to be lower than that of TPTE 11 (130 °C). By comparing TPTE 11 with TPTE (S) 32 it has been concluded that in the case of methyl substituted oligomers, linear linkage is much more effective than branch linkage in increasing the Tg.206 The influence of substitutions at the phenyl rings of oligomers in order to create stable amorphous films exceeded the effect produced by branching.
4.2. Introducing rigidity at the periphery of starburst molecules
Shirota et al. attempted to prevent a regular spatial packing of the molecules to favour the formation of a stable amorphous glassy state by incorporating a structurally rigid phenothiazine moiety in the starburst molecule TPTTA 33 (Fig. 6b).219 This molecular design was found to be more effective in decreasing the flexibility of starburst molecules in comparison with the methyl substitution in the molecules. The DSC analysis of TPTTA 33 revealed that this strategy effectively enhanced Tg up to 141 °C which is much higher than that of TDATA (S) 30. The room temperature conductivity of TPTTA 33 was observed as 1 × 10−5 S cm−1.219 Following the success of the approach of introducing a rigid periphery in starburst molecular glasses for achieving high Tg, Shirota and co-workers152 reported a novel hole transporting ‘starburst’ shaped molecule by incorporating a carbazole unit in molecular glass. 4,4,4′′-Tri(N-carbazolyl)triphenylamine (TCTA 34) (Fig. 6b) exhibited a high Tg (150 °C), high Tm (266.85 °C) and highly stable amorphous glass in an EL device.144 Shirota220 fabricated a novel EL device comprising double hole-transport layers of TCTA 34 and m-MTDATA 31 (Fig. 6a). These devices showed significant performance characteristics and high thermal stability.
4.3. Introducing rigidity at the core of starburst molecules
Based on the approach of restricting intramolecular motions beyond Tg, Cowie and Arrighi depicted the phenomenon of increasing the Tg's of polymers by the introduction of relatively stiff chemical groups (such as benzene rings) within the polymer chain which will control the flowing process.221 In 1993, Shirota and Inada156 tried to moderate the molecular structures of TDATA 29 and MTDATA 31 to achieve even higher glass transition temperatures in pursuance of enhanced device stability. They replaced the –N atom of the central TPA unit by the phenyl ring to instigate the rigidity within the oligomer.156 A new family of starburst molecules 1,3,5-tris[4-(diphenylamino)phenyl]benzene (TDAPB 35) and its methyl-substituted derivatives (1,3,5-tris[4-(2-methylphenylphenylamino)phenyl]-benzene (o-MTDAPB 36), 1,3,5-tris[4-(3-methylphenylphenylamino)phenyl]benzene (m-MTDAPB 37), and 1,3,5-tris[4-(4-methylphenylphenylamino)phenyl]benzene (p-MTDAPB 38)) were designed and studied for their morphological, molecular and solid-state properties (Fig. 6c). These molecular glasses were found to be highly stable and films remained intact for a long period of more than 6 months at room temperature. A moderate jump in Tg is observed when TDATA (S) 30 (Tg = 89 °C) is compared with TDAPB 35 (Tg = 121 °C). This is due to the presence of the benzene ring at the core of the molecule which leads to the formation of more conformers of nonplanar molecules. The readily amorphous state and Tg's higher than 100 °C of the molecule is a direct consequence of the presence of a large number of conformers.156 The hole drift mobility of m-MTDAPB 37 in its glassy state was measured by a time-of-flight method which was found to be around 1.6−10 cm2 V−1 s−1.222
4.4. Introduction of halogens in starburst molecules
A new series of starburst molecules, 1,3,5-tris(4-halogenophenylphenylamino)benzenes (p-XTDABs, where X = F, Cl, Br (42–44)), were synthesized by para-substitution of the parent molecule (1,3,5-tris(diphenylamino)benzene), TDAB 39 by halogens (Fig. 7).223 TDAB 39 was found to crystallize instantly224 and the amorphous state was found to be unstable even after insertion of methyl groups at meta and para positions (m-MTDAB 40, p-MTDAB 41). p-MTDAB 41 exhibits better stability with Tm of 210 °C and Tg of 58 °C whereas m-MTDAB 40 melts at 183 °C and exhibits Tg of 49 °C,145 while halogen substituted analogues of TDAB 39 readily formed amorphous glasses. It can be noted that the insertion of halogens induces bulkiness at the edge of the molecule and prevents easy packing and diffusion of molecules for crystal growth. The ease of glass formation, stability of the glassy state and glass transition temperature were observed to be greatly affected by the size of halogen atoms substituted at the TDAB 39. The glass transition temperatures increased as the size of the halogen increased in the order p-FTDAB 42 < p-ClTDAB 43 < p-BrTDAB 44. Heavier the halogen atom, it is likely to hamper molecular motions more effectively which leads to an increase in Tg.223

4.5. Recent developments in starburst molecular glasses
On the basis of the molecular variations of starburst HTMs discussed in earlier sections (Sec. 4.1 to Sec. 4.4), it can be perceived that the core and the periphery are two primary segments of these molecules where the modulations can take place effectively. In this section, recent progress in starburst molecular glasses is analyzed with respect to their structural advancements, morphological stability, charge conductivity and device performance.
Xu et al. reported three new TPA based starburst HTMs with different degrees of oligomerization (X19 45, X51 46 and X35 47),129,209 noteworthy for their high hole mobilities, collectively with their successful application in ssDSSCs and PSCs. Due to the higher level of conjugation in X51 46 (Fig. 7), it displayed red shifted absorption in the visible region. Hole mobilities were calculated as 1.19 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for X19 45, 1.51 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for X51 46 and 1.34 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for X35 47 in the absence of an Li-TFSI-dopant. However, the conductivity significantly increased by two orders of degree upon Li-TFSI-doping. These HTMs were studied for ssDSSCs as well as PSCs. In the whole series X51 46 exhibited the highest power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) amounting to 6.0% and 9.8% in dye sensitized and perovskite solar cells, respectively.
Ko et al.225 reported a unique hole transporting material containing a planar amine, coded as OMeTPA-FA 48 (Fig. 8). They took a fused quinolizinoacridine226 as a core unit in order to increase the lifetime of the charge-separated state by the delocalization of the generated cation over a planar amine. Better delocalization led to the red shifted absorption (383 nm) of OMeTPA-FA 48 in the UV-vis spectra compared to that of X35 47 (370 nm) which is its non-planar amine analogue.209 The HOMO level shifted from −5.13 (X35 47) to −5.15 (OMeTPA-FA 48). Hole mobilities were evaluated by the Mott–Gurney law227 and calculated to be 3.67 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The higher hole mobility of OMeTPA-FA 48 compared with X35 47 led to an improved FF.225 The overall conversion efficiency of PSCs with a planar amine derivative (OMeTPA-FA 48) is demonstrated to be 13.63% as an outcome of a short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 20.98 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.972 V, and FF of 0.67.225

X35 47 was further modified by inserting 2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxin-5-yl (EDOT) and benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-4-yl (BTD) in the side arms (Fig. 8). Two novel star-shaped hole transporting materials (HTMs), i.e., [BMPA-EDOT]3-TPA 49 and [BMPA-BTD]3-TPA 50 (ref. 189) with different optical and electronic properties were produced. When applied to the PSCs, it is observed that cell performances of [BMPA-EDOT]3-TPA 49 and [BMPA-BTD]3-TPA 50 PSCs are predominantly dependent on the side arm moieties, that is, EDOT or BTD. Electron rich EDOT and the electron withdrawing group BTD fine-tune the inductive effect differently. In contrast to BTD, EDOT stabilizes the generated cation over a triphenylamine214,228,229 leading to an incredibly comparable HOMO level (−5.24 eV), which is well aligned with CH3NH3PbI3 (−5.43 eV). The PSC performance based on [BMPA-BTD]3-TPA 50 was degraded due to a low photocurrent and reduced FF but [BMPA-EDOT]3-TPA 49 displayed an overall conversion efficiency of 12.92% which is beyond the efficiency observed for X35 47.209 The hole mobilities of [BMPA-EDOT]3-TPA 49 and [BMPA-BTD]3-TPA 50 were evaluated using the Mott–Gurney law and revealed to be 9.19 × 10−5 and 7.86 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. A novel HTM (V886 51) (Fig. 8), which is structurally similar to X51 46 (Fig. 7)129 except for the core, was reported by Nazeeruddin et al.130 It shows good solubility and excellent film-forming properties which allow the formation of thicker films of high quality. The xerographic time-of-flight method (XTOF) used to measure hole mobility indicated a hole-drift mobility of 2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 at weak electric fields and 6.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 at a field strength of 6.4 × 105 V cm−1, which are of the same order of magnitude as the ones for spiro-OMeTAD 68.212 V886 51 demonstrated very high thermal stability with a Td of around 390 °C and exhibited a high Tg of 141 °C. The overall efficiency of CH3CH2NH3PbI3-based solar cells in conjunction with V886 51 as HTM yielded efficiency as high as 17% with very high current density (>21 mA cm−2). The ionization potential was calculated as 5.04 eV which is very close to that of spiro-OMeTAD 68 (5.00 eV).130
Grätzel et al.230 demonstrated triazatruxene-based TPA compounds (KR145 52 and KR133 53) as a new class of HTMs to be used in highly efficient PSCs (Fig. 9a). The triazatruxene core consists of three indole units joined at the same benzene ring. This arrangement provides a two-dimensional π-system and a large aromatic surface that overlap with each other for efficient intermolecular charge transfer. DSC measurements of KR145 52 and KR133 53 revealed that both the HTMs are highly amorphous in nature with good thermal stability up to ∼440 °C.230 Insertion of an additional phenyl ring between the triazatruxene core and the electron donating moiety (TPA) in KR133 53 stabilized the oxidation potential by 200 mV from KR145 52.230 It resulted in HOMO level shifting from −5.06 eV for KR145 52 to −5.26 eV for KR133 53. These materials were successfully employed in a (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 based PSC. Due to the deeper HOMO level of KR133 53, it demonstrated a high Voc of 1.133 V which is even higher than that of spiro-OMeTAD 68 (1.073 V).230 The average overall efficiency obtained by cells incorporating KR133 53 as HTM was 15.8% which is much higher than the one (11.5%) produced by KR145 52 as HTM.

KR145 52 is further modulated by integrating three more hexyl side-chains to produce a new HTM, i.e., Trux-OMeTAD 54 (Fig. 9a) with a tuned HOMO level (−5.28 eV) and a high hole mobility of 2.3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1.231 Hole mobility is later increased to 3.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 after annealing the films at 150 °C for 10 min which is nearly 2 orders of magnitude higher than those of neat spiro-OMeTAD 68 and poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) (between 10−5 and 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1).148,232 TGA and DSC analysis of Trux-OMeTAD 54 indicated a high thermal stability up to 400 °C with a melting point of 212 °C. PSCs fabricated by Trux-OMeTAD 54 as a HTM layer consisted of p–i–n architecture with MAPbI3 as the absorber and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid (PCBM) as the ETL. A high PCE of 18.6% with negligible hysteresis under AM 1.5 G of illumination is reported which is one of the highest values observed so far for the p–i–n PSC devices employing dopant-free HTMs.231
Very recently Nazeeruddin et al.233 reported the synthesis and characterization of two D–A–D–A-type low bandgap molecular semiconductors JK-216D 55 and JK-217D 56 (Fig. 9b) which are based on an asymmetric squaraine chromophore. Squaraines are a valuable class of organic dyes with extremely high molar extinction coefficients (>105 L mol−1 cm−1 at 650 nm) and strong absorption in the near infrared (NIR) region of the solar spectrum.234,235 They are identified by their exclusive aromatic four membered ring system derived from squaric acid. Due to their ability to efficiently convert the low-energy (∼1.4 eV) photons into electricity,236 squaraines have been used as a complementary absorber in DSSCs.237,238 Squaraines are also known to exhibit p-type semiconductive properties and high field-effect hole mobilities of ∼10−5 to 1.3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (ref. 234 and 239), which suggests their applications based on their dual functions of light harvesting as well as hole transporting layers.233 JK-216D 55 and JK-217D 56 exhibit almost identical absorption spectra with sharp absorption bands in the longer wavelength region 600–800 nm. High molar absorption coefficients of 119000 M−1 cm−1 and 147600 M−1 cm−1 were observed at 720 nm and 723 nm for JK-216D 55 and JK-217D 56, respectively. They have been used as HTMs in perovskite solar cells for the first time with the realization of high PCEs of up to 14.7%. Novel benzotrithiophene (BTT) HTMs, i.e., BTT-1 57, BTT-2 58 and BTT-3 59 (Fig. 10) are the newly discovered members of TPA based star shaped HTMs recently reported by Molina et al.240 They are synthesized by crosslinking TPA-based donor groups with a BTT core. The BTT core imparts planarity in a structure which aids in promoting effective π–π intermolecular interaction, leading to enhanced hole-transport properties. The HOMO levels of BTT-1 57, BTT-2 58 and BTT-3 59 are calculated as −5.2, −5.2 and −5.4 eV, respectively. The highest conductivity reaching 2.79 × 10−5 S cm−1 is displayed by BTT-3 59 which also supports the highest achieved efficiency of PSCs incorporating BTT-3 59 (Table 2). The devices are optimized for different HTM thicknesses and different active layer compositions. High efficiencies in the range of 16% to 18.2% were gained under AM 1.5 sun with BTT-1 57, BTT-2 58 and BTT-3 59.

5. Spiro-linked compounds
This part of the article is allotted to the structurally most stable and one of the most adapted forms of molecular glasses, i.e., spiro. The focus is given to only one type of spiro linking unit, which is, bifluorene (Fig. 11b). So far several spiro compounds have been synthesized with most of them containing spirobifluorene as the central core.159,160 One of the important features of spirobifluorene is that it can be substituted at each position which gives a huge scope for the development of novel molecules.145 Most of the spiro compounds which incorporate arylamines exhibit a strong absorption in the ultraviolet (UV) range (between 375 and 383 nm) with extinction coefficients between 42000 and 82000 M−1 cm−1.241
 Fig. 11  General structure of spiro linked molecules (a) and molecular structure of spirobifluorene (b)247. 
In the following sections we will be discussing about the concept behind the stability of spiro structures, different types of peripheral substitutions at the spirobifluorene core and their influence on the conductivity and optical properties.
5.1. Spiro concept
Naito and Miura144,145 showed a relationship between a unique molecular structure and the stability of the amorphous state. It was observed that the molecules with a high molecular weight, symmetric round structure, and small intermolecular linkage lead to a high stability of the amorphous state. For the first time, Clarkson and Gomberg synthesized unsubstituted 9,9′-spirobifluorene (Scheme 1) in 1930.242 They obtained 2-iodobiphenyl (a) through Sandmeyer's reaction from 2-aminobiphenyl and converted it to the Grignard reagent which was further reacted with 9-fluorenone in order to produce the intermediate compound 9-(biphenyl-2-yl)-9-fluorenol (c). The final step of ring closure was carried out by adding a catalytic amount of hydrochloric acid to a boiling solution of the carbinol in acetic acid. Following this synthesis route the overall yield observed was 59% which has been improved upto 90% with the aid of several modifications in the synthesis procedures until now.243–246

These molecules are based on a very promising concept of connecting two molecular π-systems via a common sp3-hybridized atom158 (Fig. 11a). The spiro concept is a persuasive way to incorporate all the structural prerequisites in order to achieve a high Tg. Due to the sp3-hybridized atom at the junction of two molecular halves, they preferably acquire perpendicular arrangement and create a highly sterically demanding structure. This molecular arrangement induces rigidity in the molecule which impedes crystallization below the glass transition temperature (Tg) effectively and enhances the stability of the amorphous state. Due to the perpendicular arrangement of both units, the chances of intermolecular π–π interactions become very bleak and lead to increased solubility of spiro compounds compared to their parent non-spiro molecules.247 Although a bulky shape leading to high glass transition temperature (Tg) is the key feature of spiro compounds, the crystallization kinetics above Tg depends upon the substitution patterns on spirobifluorene.248 In accordance with the substitution patterns, spiro compounds can be categorized into two classes, i.e., symmetrically substituted and asymmetrically substituted molecules.

5.1.1. Symmetric spiro compounds. 
Symmetrically substituted molecules are substituted at 2,2′,7,7′ positions of spirobifluorene in a symmetric manner and do not exhibit chirality. This class of spiro compounds are generally used in hole transport layers of EL, DSSC and PSC devices. Following the spiro structural concept Bestgen et al. synthesized spirolinked versions of TAD 60, termed as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(diphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-TAD 61) (Fig. 12).211 The spiro linkage of two TADs resulted in a high glass transition temperature of 133 °C which is 60 °C higher than that of TAD 60.211 It was observed that the Tg's of the parent compound arylamines improved considerably in their corresponding spiro compounds. Other examples are TTB 62, TPD 9 and α-NPB 63, which exhibit low Tg's such as 66, 60 and 95 °C.197 In contrast, the Tg's of their corresponding spiro compounds for spiro-TTB 64, spiro-TPD 65 and spiro-α-NPB 66 (Fig. 12) are 146, 115 and 147 °C, respectively.197,249–252 Based on the concept of fine tuning of the electronic properties reported by Facci and Stolka253 by adding two electron donating p-methoxy groups to a TPD derivative, the substitution of the basic spiro-TPD 65 was attempted by Salbeck et al.211 They modified the spiro-TPD 65 molecule by adding eight electron donating p-methoxy groups and synthesized 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD 68) (Fig. 12). The electron donating properties of the p-methoxy substituents resulted in a higher electronic overlap of spiro-OMeTAD 68 in the solid state. This leads to the lowered oxidation potential of spiro-OMeTAD 68 by 0.1 V, compared to spiro-TAD 61. The stability of the amorphous state of spiro-OMeTAD 68 films increased considerably when compared to its parent compound MeOTAD 67. A higher glass transition temperature (Tg) of 121 °C could be achieved compared to spiro-TPD 65 (Tg = 115 °C).211
 Fig. 12  Symmetrically substituted spiro molecules. 
With the purpose of introducing rigidity at the molecular edges to retard the packing in the most effective way as it had been attempted earlier in starburst molecular glasses,152,217 an interesting modification of spiro-TAD 61 was ventured by Salbeck et al. They synthesized 2,2′,7,7′-tetra-(N-carbazolyl)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-CARB 69) by incorporating carbazole units at the periphery of the molecule (Fig. 12).254 Spiro-CARB 69 showed an extraordinary high melting point of 538 °C and a high Tg of 240 °C. The X-ray crystallographic analysis of spiro-CARB 69 showed that carbazole units twisted against the fluorene unit which led to a highly rigid molecular arrangement and highly stable amorphous state.211,249,251,254 Using the spiro-concept, Bestgen et al.211 synthesized another class of symmetrically substituted blue light emitting spiro compounds in the form of symmetrically spiro-linked p-oligophenyls (Fig. 13a). Despite the fact that the molecular weight is doubled in the spiro-linkage of two such chains by only one additional carbon atom, a highly soluble material is formed. This solubility was found to be several orders of magnitude higher than the solubility of the parent p-oligophenyls and was evident in all spiro-linked p-oligophenyls (spiro-nΦs) 70. It was observed that the steric demand increased by increasing the chain length of oligophenyls which in turn raised the glass transition temperature of spiro-oligophenyls. For instance it has been reported as 184 °C (spiro-4Φ 71), 212 °C (spiro-6Φ 72), and 243 °C (spiro-8Φ 73) for the series.158,211,251 Additional branching leads to even higher Tg's which is evident by the DSC analysis of spiro-octo-2 74 and 4-spiro275 (Fig. 13a). The Tg's of 74 and 75 (236 and 273 °C, respectively) were found to exceed the Tg of spiro-6Φ 72 (212 °C).158,250–252,254

5.1.2. Asymmetric spiro compounds. 
Asymmetric spiro compounds can be subdivided as left-right asymmetric (2,2′-A, 7,7′-B substitution) and top-down asymmetric (2,7-A, 2′,7′-B substitution) compounds, with respect to substitution patterns at 2,2′,7,7′ positions of spirobifluorene.241 If different substituents are applied at the 2,2′- and 7,7′-positions (2,2′-A, 7,7′-B substitution, “left-right asymmetric”), the molecular point group changes to C2 and optically active materials are obtained. Such spiro compounds with indole 76 and phenanthroline 77 substituents in the 2- and 2′-positions were studied by Wu et al. for their photophysical properties (Fig. 13b).255 The substitution of different types of moieties (electron donor and electron acceptor) at 2 and 7 positions of fluorene units in spirobifluorenes results in a highly conjugated charge transfer system with red shifted low-energy emission. This class of spiro compounds includes spiro-AMO-t-Bu 78, spiro-AMPO-t-Bu 79, spiro-AMO-CN 80 and spiro-AMPO-CN 81 (Fig. 13b).256,257 Calorimetric measurements for the left-right asymmetric spiro compounds (spiro-AMO-t-Bu 78, spiro-AMPO-t-Bu 79, spiro-AMO-CN 80, spiro-AMPO-CN 81) displayed high Tg's ranging from 165 to 212 °C.251 These values are even higher than those obtained for the symmetric spiro compounds. A similar effect was observed for spiro-PBD 83 which is a spiro-linked version of PBD 82 (Fig. 13b). Although both the materials form highly transparent and amorphous films, PBD 82 films turned turbid within a short period of an hour. Spiro-PBD 83 films remained intact at even higher than room temperature for prolonged exposure. Both the films were studied by SEM, which declared the formation of micrometer sized crystals in PBD 82 due to recrystallization but there was no sign of crystallization in spiro-PBD 83 films. A high Tg of 163 °C was achieved for spiro-PBD 83 which is even higher than the melting point of the parent molecule PBD 82 (138 °C).211,249 If different substituents are applied at the 2,7- and 2′,7′-positions (2,7-A, 2′,7′-B substitution), it gives origin to top-down asymmetry. Usually top-down asymmetric spiro compounds exhibit Tg values between those of the corresponding symmetric spiro compounds.255 For example, spiro-DPSP 87 (Fig. 13c) shows a Tg of 152 °C, which lies between the Tg's of spiro-6Φ 72 and spiro-TAD 61. This class of spiro compounds includes the series spiro-DPO 86 and spiro-SPO 84 (Fig. 13c). The introduction of electron donating and electron acceptor groups at each half of the molecule in the top-down asymmetric spiro molecule has been done for tuning the optical activity of such compounds. Spiro-MeO-DPO 85 (Fig. 13c) is an example of this type of series of compounds.258–261

5.2. Molecular engineering and recent developments
In the last one decade along with the remarkable development in PSC active layer (MAPbI3) and fabrication techniques, there has been a considerable progress in the area of organic HTMs. It is obvious in our previous sections that rigorous work has been put up and a variety of HTMs (linear, starburst and spiro) are developed for PSCs.
However, it has also been suggested that the PSCs based on linear and starburst HTM materials show lower PCEs and stability compared with the one based on spiro compounds. To date spiro-OMeTAD is the only champion spiro HTM that benchmarked the PCE of PSCs as high as 19.3% in conjunction with the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx active layer.262 An advanced growth of a new type of spiro-HTMs is very much desirable in order to take the PCE of PSC devices to the next level. Lately, new spiro type HTMs have been developed and studied for their charge carrier transfer processes which are very important and play a notable role.263 The basic role of extracting the holes from the excitons reaching the interface between the perovskite and the HTL while rejecting the electrons backward to the ETL depends on the electronic properties (energy level alignments (HOMO–LUMO level)). Apart from revealing the hole injection ability, the molecular HOMO level also reflects the open-circuit voltage of the PSC device. For an efficient PSC, the HOMO level of HTMs should be higher than the valence band of perovskite and the LUMO level should be higher than the conduction band of perovskite to prevent the electron transportation from perovskite to the metal electrodes.264
In order to fine tune the electronic properties of spiro-TAD 61, methoxy groups were introduced at para positions211,253 and spiro-OMeTAD 68 with improved oxidation potential was produced for the first time. It has been reported by Hammett and co-workers that the –OMe substituent shows two opposite effects depending upon the substitution position in the aromatic ring.265 He detailed the electron-donating activity of –OMe at the para position and electron-withdrawing activity at the meta position.265 Besides these electronic effects, substitution of –OMe at the ortho position can induce the steric effect which also influences the oxidation potential. Based on such electronic effects exhibited by the –OMe substituent, Seok and co-workers reported a simple and effective approach to fine tune the electronic properties by adjusting the substitution position of the –OMe group in spiro-type arylamine HTMs.134 They synthesized the three spiro-OMeTAD (pp-, pm- and po-spiro-OMeTAD 88, 89, 90) derivatives by replacing one of the two p-OMe substituents in each of the quadrants of spiro-OMeTAD with an o- or m-OMe substituent (Fig. 14) and investigated their structure–property relationship in PSCs.
 Fig. 14  Adjustments of the substitution position of the –OMe group in spiro-type arylamine HTMs. 
Substantial changes in optical and electronic properties of the derivatives were observed as the absorption onsets of the three derivatives moved to shorter wavelengths in going from pp-spiro-OMeTAD 88 (423 nm) to pm-spiro-OMeTAD 89 (413 nm) to po-spiro-OMeTAD 90 (409 nm). Since the absorption onset wavelength illustrates the optical band-gap energy of the materials, it implies that the change in the –OMe substituent position from para to meta and ortho increased the bandgap energies relative to the well-known pp-spiro-OMeTAD 88. As the m-OMe group exhibits an electron-withdrawing effect while the p-OMe group exerts an electron-donating effect,265 the substitution from para to meta increased the oxidation potential. However, no change in oxidation potential was observed for po-spiro-OMeTAD 90, which shows retention of the electron-donating property of the –OMe group. The HOMO energies were calculated as −5.22 eV, −5.31 eV and −5.22 eV for pp-88, pm-89 and po-spiro-OMeTAD 90, respectively. The LUMO energy of the ortho substituent increased by 0.10 eV relative to the para substituent because of the steric effect generated between the o-OMe-phenyl group and the fluorene ring. This caused a decrease in the effective conjugation of the molecule and consequently an increase in band gap energy. The PSC performance incorporating the derivative with the o-OMe substituent improved remarkably. A Jsc of 21.2 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.02 V, and a FF of 0.78 were achieved which resulted in an overall PCE of 16.7% which is higher than that with the p-OMe substituent (∼15%). Nevertheless, due to the non-planarity of the conjugated system of spiro-OMeTAD 68, where amino phenyl motifs are not part of the extended π-system, any such organic modifications are expected to affect the ionization potential within a narrow range.266–269 In order to establish these experimental findings,270 Murray and co-workers calculated the ionization potentials of spiro-OMeTAD 68 with a variety of alterations in the positioning of –OMe substituents, varying the HOMO energies with a computationally efficient method (Fig. 15b).271 The molecular structure detailed in Fig. 15a (spiro-OMeTAD derivatives 91) identifies two arylamine rings as r1 (green) and r2 (red) where the substitution positions of –OMe substituents alter as o, m, and p. The results of theoretical calculation were found to be in harmony with experimental measures from solution voltammetry. It is depicted from their work that the alteration of –OMe substituents offers flexibility in work functions to a certain extent only.271 The only derivative with a notably smaller IP than others is the one where r1 = r2 = o, o caused by the ortho position of the electron donating –OMe substituents.272 The IP of poly –OMe substitutions was observed to be decreased which is suspected to be due to repulsive interactions between adjacent rings led by steric hindrance. The Kohn–Sham energy gap (Eg) which is depicted in Fig. 14b in red is calculated to be relatively constant for all derivatives.

Data regenerated from ref. 269. 
Getautis et al. drew attention towards the thermal stability of spiro-OMeTAD 68 and investigated the impact of thermal stress on the stability of the asymmetrically substituted spiro-HTMs (spiro-HTM1 92, spiro-HTM2 93 and spiro-HTM3 94) (Fig. 16a).273 Spiro-HTM1 92, spiro-HTM2 93 and spiro-HTM3 94 are synthesized by minor modifications in spiro-OMeTAD 68 as a result of introducing additional phenyl rings and alkyl chains on the phenyl motifs of TPA units. The strategy adopted here was based on creating asymmetry within the spiro-OMeTAD 68 molecule which was expected to lead to difficult packing and higher morphological stability of amorphous films. The DSC and TGA experiments substantiated the existence of spiro-OMeTAD 68 in both crystalline and amorphous states. Tg of 128 °C and Tm of 245 °C were observed for spiro-OMeTAD 68 along with crystallization detected at 182 °C. It was presumed that on liquefying above the glass transition temperature nucleation centers were formed and promoted the crystallization of the amorphous state of spiro-OMeTAD 68. This finding indicated the instability of the amorphous state of spiro-OMeTAD 68 in contrast to earlier beliefs.211 DSC analysis of spiro-HTM1–HTM3 92–94 has shown elevated stability (Tg's > 128 °C) of spiro-HTM2 92 and spiro-HTM3 94 in comparison with spiro-OMeTAD 68. Because of the least disturbance to the molecular structure by introduction of methyl groups in spiro-HTM1 92, it behaved more or less like spiro-OMeTAD 68 with co-existence of both amorphous and crystalline states. Enhanced asymmetry by addition of an extra phenyl ring in spiro-HTM2 93 and spiro-HTM3 94 stabilized their amorphous states (Tg's 139 and 135 °C). As discussed earlier that organic modification is expected to affect the IPs of spiro-OMeTADs within a narrow range,266–270 IP values of spiro-HTM1 92, spiro-HTM2 93 and spiro-HTM3 94 are found to be very similar to that of spiro-OMeTAD 68 and close to 5.00 eV. No significant influence of substitutions was observed on the hole mobilities of asymmetrically substituted spiro-HTMs 92–94 which could be due to their asymmetric nature, preventing the tight packing and restricting the hopping of charges from one molecule to another. Hole drift mobility was observed to be in the range of spiro-OMeTAD 68 for spiro-HTM1 92 (10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and 1 order of magnitude lower for spiro-HTM2 93 and spiro-HTM3 94 (10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1) due to the higher degree of asymmetry caused by the phenyl ring.
 Fig. 16  Asymmetrical substitution of additional phenyl rings and alkyl chains in spiro-OMeTAD (92–94) (a), acridine unit incorporation in spirobifluorene based molecular glass (95–97) and incorporation of the diphenylamine (DPA) unit (98) (b) and xanthene unit (99) in spirobifluorene based molecular glass and the molecular structure of PST1 (100) (c). 
In order to induce asymmetry to the spiro molecule for amplifying the stability of the amorphous state without compromising on its hole mobility, Guo and co-workers brought in an amazing strategy of replacing half of the spiro-OMeTAD 68 with a functional acridine unit possessing alkyl side chains at different substitutional positions (CW3 95, CW4 96 and CW5 97) (Fig. 16b).274 The major advantage of this molecular structure is that half of the structure holds the substantial feature of spiro-OMeTAD 68 so that the suitable ionization potentials are retained. Their high Td's (234–254 °C) and high Tg's (127–148 °C) demonstrate the rigidity of the molecules which increases with the number of t-Bu substitutions on the phenyl motifs of the acridine unit. A mild effect of this rigidity which would lead to non-planarity of the molecule is observed on hole mobility and hole conductivity. The hole conductivity values are measured to be 5.92, 3.54 and 3.09 × 10−6 S cm−1, whereas, the hole mobility values are estimated to be 1.2, 0.58 and 0.87 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for CW3 95, CW4 96, and CW5 97, respectively. These molecules were used in PSCs with the structure TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTM/Au under doping conditions. Among all devices the CW4 96 based device showed the best performance with a Jsc of 21.75 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.050 V, and FF of 0.72, with a PCE of 16.56% under AM 1.5 G illumination. A similar molecule (SAF-OMe 98) (Fig. 16b) was recently designed and synthesized by Jiang et al.138 in order to further increase hole mobility by incorporating di-phenylamine (DPA) units on the acridine moiety of CW3 95.274 Apart from inheriting the advantage of spiro-OMeTAD 68, incorporation of DPA into the spiro core improved the hole mobility and thermal stability of SAF-OMe 98 dramatically. Excellent thermal stability with Td as high as 425 °C and Tg of 126 °C has been observed. Hole only devices were fabricated with the structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/SAF-OMe 98/MoOx/Ag for the investigation of hole mobility.
The results calculated by the Mott–Gurney law showed much higher hole mobility of doped SAF-OMe 98 (9.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) than the reported values of CW series (CW-3 95, CW-4 96, CW-5 97).274 This remarkable upgradation of hole mobility is credited to the presence of TPA units in both the halves of asymmetric spiro-HTM (SAF-OMe 98).275 The HOMO energy level of SAF-OMe 98 (−5.07 eV) was calculated to be well aligned with that of perovskite (−5.22 eV) and verifies its suitability for the PSCs. Together with a suitable HOMO its LUMO energy was estimated to be −2.11 eV which results in a large barrier of around 1.82 eV between perovskite and SAF-OMe 98 layers and blocks the electrons efficiently. Devices with a geometry of ITO/TiOx/perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3−xClx)/HTM (SAF-OMe 98)/Ag are fabricated to ensure the photovoltaic characteristics of SAF-OMe 98. The PCE based on SAF-OMe 98 was observed as 16.73%.
Recently, the acridine moiety of SAF-OMe 98 has been replaced by xanthene to produce a highly efficient spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene] (SFX) based HTM termed as X60 99 which demonstrated a record breaking efficiency of 19.84% when used in PSCs (Fig. 16c).276 The device configuration adopted is compact TiO2/nc-TiO2/perovskite/HTM (X60 99)/Au. The active layer of these devices incorporated a mixture of methylammonium bromide (MABr), formamidinium iodide (FAI), lead iodide (PbI2) and lead bromide (PbBr2) in a mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO solution (volume ratio 4:1).277 X60 99 is used by incorporating a suitable dopant in all the experiments and device fabrication. X60 99 exhibits hole mobility of 1.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a suitable HOMO energy level of −5.61 eV. No stability data of the amorphous state are reported for X60 99.
On the basis of the spiro structure Ganesan et al. designed and developed a novel HTM, PST1 100 (4,4′,4′′,4′′′-(2H,2′H,4H,4′H-3,3′-spiro-bi[thieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxepine]-6,6′,8,8′-tetrayl)tetrakis-(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline)) (Fig. 16c).278 In PST1 100, the tetrahedral sp3 hybridized carbon in between the two propylenedioxythiophene units adopts a spiro conformation. The molecular structures of PST1 100 and spiro-OMeTAD 68 were evaluated by parallel X-ray crystallography.278 It has been accounted that four carbon atoms attached to the spiro link certainly do not lie in the same plane but four oxygen atoms and two thiophene rings are mostly coplanar. The co-planarity is induced by two seven-membered alkylenedioxy rings which assist in releasing the distortion. As a result several kinds of intermolecular interactions (CH/π, O–C and π–π) take place in PST1 100 which lead to lowering of the HOMO level and partially attributed to the increased Voc of PSCs with PST1 100 as the HTM layer. The HOMO value of PST1 100 (−5.15 eV) is calculated to be 80 mV lower than that of spiro-OMeTAD 68 (−5.07 eV).213 PST1 100 displayed remarkable performance in PSCs and a high overall conversion efficiency of 13.44% could be achieved in the presence of a cobalt dopant. Sticking to the spirobifluorene core, three new spiro-HTMs (spiro-F1 101, spiro-F2 102 and spiro-F3 103) (Fig. 17)264 were recently examined by density functional theory combined with the Marcus theory and Einstein relationship.264 These materials consist of different peripheral constitutions, such as, the bismethoxyphenylaniline and bisdimethylfluorenylamino moieties substituted at the spiro core which play an important role in lowering the HOMO levels of the HTMs. The calculated results demonstrate lower HOMO levels of spiro-F1 101 (−5.31 eV), spiro-F2 102 (−5.42 eV) and spiro-F3 103 (−5.10 eV) compared with that of spiro-OMeTAD 68 (−5.09 eV) which assure a high Voc of the PSCs fabricated by incorporating the respective HTMs. The calculated hole mobilities of spiro-OMeTAD 68, spiro-F1 101, spiro-F2 102 and spiro-F3 103 are 5.65 × 10−3, 1.75 × 10−2, 2.60 × 10−4 and 7.59 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The higher hole mobilities of spiro-F1 101 and spiro-F3 103 in comparison with spiro-F2 102 could be due to the presence of the strong electron donating methoxy (–OMe) group present at the periphery of the two compounds (spiro-F1 101 and spiro-F3 103). The stability properties of spiro-F1 101 and spiro-F3 103 were found to be similar to that of spiro-OMeTAD 68. Thus, spiro-F1 101, spiro-F2 102 and spiro-F3 103 are expected to acquire high PCEs when applied to PSCs as HTMs.

Recently Abate et al. thought beyond spirofluorene and incorporated the novel silolothiophene with TPA279 (Fig. 17). It was observed that silolothiophene linked methoxytriphenylamines (PEH-2 104) enable even more stable PSCs owing to the increased half life of the device. With the aid of thermal gravimetric analysis the superior thermal stability of PEH-2 104 was revealed as its Tg is over 100 °C higher than that of spiro-OMeTAD which is the main reason for the degradation of PEH-2 104 devices with a half life 6 times larger than that of spiro-OMeTAD devices. The results convince that by exploring new silolothiophene-TPA derivatives, both PCE and stability of PSCs can be worked upon extensively.
6. Conclusions and future aspects
After years of efforts to produce cheaper solar cells than silicon based ones, PSCs came as a great relief to the solar cell community which proved the potential of ambipolar perovskite materials in the active layer of the device. The efficiency has reached the certified value of 22.1% within a short span of 4 years.104 The degradation of PSCs starts at the outermost layer of the device which is the HTM, due to varying atmospheric conditions (temperature, humidity). This is an overview of significant publications in the field of organic hole transporting materials mainly for DSSCs and PSCs, provided with the perspective of structural designing and its effect on hole mobility, ionization potential and stability of the amorphous state (high Tg).
Most of the HTMs are comprised of the triphenyl amine (TPA) moiety which acts as a good electron donor unit.198 The TPA functional moiety possesses two basic properties: easy oxidizability of the amine nitrogen atom and the ability to transport positive charges efficiently.199 Linear oligomeric triphenylamines based HTMs are shown to have a shift in Tg to a higher temperature and increased hole mobility as the number of TPA units increases. The introduction of long alkyl chains into the HTM molecular structure significantly improves the solubility of HTMs which in turn leads to better pore infiltration of the device. Other variations in the structural designs of linear HTMs such as the incorporation of heteromolecules and olefinic bonds in TPA-based linear oligomers have shown an incredible effect on the hole mobilities of these HTMs.191,214 But the stability of their amorphous state remains uncertain due to the easy packing and subsequent crystallization of linearly arranged molecules.
The amorphous state can be prevented by adopting a non-planar (starburst) oligomeric molecular structure. Such starburst molecules demonstrate much higher Tg's than their linear counter parts. In order to prevent a regular spatial packing of the molecules to keep the amorphous glassy state stable, structurally rigid groups (phenothiazine moiety)219 and halogens, i.e., F, Cl, Br were incorporated at the periphery of starburst molecules.223 Introduction of rigidity at the core of starburst molecules by incorporating a benzene ring, fused quinolizinoacridine, benzotrithiophene (BTT) and triazatruxene leads to the formation of more conformers of nonplanar molecules and consequently shows high Tg's.213,226,230,231,240 Recent advances also include dual functional starburst HTMs223 and the integration of different types of groups (electron rich EDOT and the electron-withdrawing group BTD) into the side arms of starburst HTMs to fine-tune the inductive effect differently for producing different optical and electronic properties.189 In order to induce an even higher degree of rigidity to put a halt on crystallization and increase the Tg's and stability of the HTM films, starburst structures were advanced to the molecules with spiro type arrangement incorporated at the core. Irregular packing of molecules causes a sustainable amorphous state of the films in the device. In recent years different kinds of strategies have been adopted to modulate the stability and tune the IPs of spiro-HTMs, such as introduction of peripheral rigidity,211,249–254 different types of substituents at different substitution positions at the spirobifluorene core249–254,265,273 and a variety of cores.276–278
We have seen significant progress in the development of organic HTMs which shows the dominance of spiro-based HTMs over others (linear, starburst) in ssDSSCs and PSCs. The clear improvement in the stability of PSCs is also correlated with the superior thermal stability of the silolothiophene-TPA link compared to the spirofluorene linked TPA based HTMs.279 This review notifies the ample scope of further improvement in PCEs by coherent designing of new HTMs to tune their properties as per the absorbers in solar cells.
