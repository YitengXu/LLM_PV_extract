These patterns were formed using a hybrid nanoimprint lithography technique and annealed at 100 °C to evaporate the solvent (xylene). Compared to the bare, un-patterned PV protective glass, the PV protective glass patterned on both sides had superior optical properties. Transmittance of the PV protective glass patterned on both sides increased by up to 3.13% and reflectance decreased by up to 3.42%, and the transmittance was increased for all angles of incidence. Furthermore, the JSC of devices with the PV protective glass patterned on both sides increased by up to 3.15%. Finally, a monitoring system was set up to measure electricity generated by PV modules. The efficiency of the PV module with PV protective glass patterned on both sides was enhanced by up to 12.16% compared with that of the PV module with un-patterned PV protective glass.
Introduction
Following increasing concern regarding environmental pollution, green energy technologies have been suggested to replace conventional fossil fuel power generation. In particular, photovoltaic systems are being widely studied because they can convert solar energy to electricity without emitting CO2.1–3 Photovoltaic (PV) protective glass is used to protect solar cells from external shock;4,5 however as a result, incident light is reflected off the surface of the glass, resulting in decreased conversion efficiencies of PV modules. Typically, anti-reflection layers are needed to minimize reflections off the surface of PV protective glass.
In this study, moth-eye structures, a type of anti-reflection structure, were formed on the surface of PV protective glass using hybrid nanoimprint lithography (H-NIL). Typically, nanoimprint lithography processes use either heating or ultra violet (UV) exposure for curing an imprint resin. The UV-curable polysilsesquioxane, used here as an imprint resin, is a photo-initiator and dissolves in xylene, and therefore, both heating and UV exposure are required to evaporate the solvent and to cure the resin. The H-NIL process, which uses both heating and UV exposure, is thus ideal to fabricate moth-eye structures using this material.
Reflection normally occurs due to a rapid change in refractive index. Moth-eye structures enable gradual changes in refractive index, which act to reduce reflection through the moth-eye effect.6–10 To fabricate micro- and nanosized structures, many advanced lithographic techniques have been proposed, such as those involving electron beam (e-beam), X-ray, deep-ultraviolet, and immersion.11–14 However, only nanoimprint lithography can help to fabricate micro- and nanosized structures on various types of substrates through a simpler and lower-cost process.15–18 Nanoimprint lithography is also an optimized technology to fabricate nanosized anti-reflection patterns (such as moth-eye structures) on textured PV protective glass.19
UV-curable, ladder-like polysilsesquioxane has been used to fabricate moth-eye patterns on PV protective glass.20,21 Generally, UV-curable polymers are used to fabricate functional films or structures mainly due to advantages such as the increased production rate and superior elastic properties.22,23 However, conventional UV-curable polymers become weak due to heat damage and are easily discolored.24 In this study, an organic–inorganic hybrid material was used to overcome the disadvantages of fully organic polymers. The organic–inorganic hybrid material used in this study has superior thermal stability, hardness, and chemical durability compared with conventional organic materials.20,21 Indeed, the resultant pattern using the organic material appears to be more consolidated. Besides that, the inorganic material has superior mechanical properties. Therefore, we chose the organic–inorganic hybrid material to benefit the advantages of both materials.
Experimental
Preparation of PV protective glass
The glass substrate used for this study as PV protective glass had a low iron content (less than 95 ppm). The PV protective glass had a thickness of 3 mm and was manufactured by Nuri Co., Korea. The glass had a textured inward side (facing the PV module) and a flat outward side. The textured side had mountain-shaped structures with widths and heights of 800 μm and 80 μm, respectively, forming a regular pattern. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images shown in Fig. 1 were recorded using a field emission SEM (FE-SEM) manufactured by Hitachi, Japan (Hitachi S-4300).

Fabricating Ni and PDMS molds and replicating anti-reflection patterns on the PV protective glass
A polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mold was manufactured from a Ni master mold with moth-eye patterns.25 The Ni master mold was fabricated using laser interference lithography (LIL) and electro-plating technologies.26 There are various methods to manufacture moth-eye patterns such as anodized aluminum oxide (AAO)27 and nano-sphere lithography. Nevertheless, we manufacture moth-eye patterns using LIL technology due to their superior anti-reflection property compared to those which were manufactured using other technologies. The properties of the moth-eye structures were simulated using a finite difference time domain (FDTD) system.28 The fabricated moth-eye structure had a width of 250–300 nm and a height of 250–265 nm. PDMS was dispensed onto the Ni master mold and heat-treated at 80 °C for 3 hours to cure the PDMS. After cooling, the PDMS was detached from the Ni master mold. Fig. 2 shows a schematic diagram of the procedure used to fabricate the PDMS mold.

Fig. 3 shows the overall process used to transfer the moth-eye patterns onto PV protective glass using H-NIL. A UV-curable polysilsesquioxane was coated onto the PDMS mold by spin-coating at 3000 rpm for 30 seconds. The UV-curable polysilsesquioxane resin contained 10 wt% silsesquioxane, 5 wt% Irgacure-184 (Ciba, Switzerland), and 75 wt% xylene (Sigma Aldrich, USA). The UV-curable polysilsesquioxane coated on the PDMS mold was transferred to both the flat and textured sides of the PV protective glass, depending on the sample type.
 Fig. 3  Overall process used to fabricate the moth-eye patterns on PV protective glass. 
The solvent (xylene) was evaporated by heating to 80 °C at a pressure of 5 bar for 10 min. The glass was then exposed to UV for 10 minutes to cure the polysilsesquioxane. After cooling the PDMS molds and the PV protective glass, the PDMS molds were detached from the glass substrate. To completely remove the solvent (xylene), the moth-eye patterns were annealed in N2. The temperature was increased from room temperature to 100 °C over 1 hour, maintained there for 1 hour, and then cooled back to room temperature over 1 hour.
Results and discussion
Moth-eye patterns formed on PV protective glass
SEM images of the moth-eye patterns formed on the PV protective glass are shown in Fig. 4. SEM images of the flat and textured sides of the glass samples are shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b) after patterning on only one side and Fig. 4(c) and (d) after patterning on both sides. Moth-eye patterns with cone widths of 250–350 nm were formed uniformly and with high fidelity over the entire surface of the PV protective glass.

Fig. 5 shows atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the Ni master mold with moth-eye patterns and their reproduction on the PV protective glass (textured side). The moth-eye patterns on the Ni master mold have a height of 264.70 nm and a conical structure as shown in Fig. 5(a). In Fig. 5(b), the moth-eye patterns on UV-curable polysilsesquioxane have a height of 233.52 nm and appear to have shapes identical to those of the Ni master mold. The moth-eye patterns of the Ni master mold were replicated on the textured PV protective glass with very high fidelity.

Changes in optical and electrical properties caused by moth-eye patterns

Fig. 6 shows the changes in transmittance and reflectance caused by the presence of moth-eye patterns on the PV protective glass. The optical properties were measured using an integrating sphere spectrophotometer (Jasco V650, USA). As shown in Fig. 6(a), the transmittance was increased compared to un-patterned bare glass. At a wavelength of 400 nm, a shift of transmittance is observed, an intrinsic property of moth-eye structures used in this study.
 Fig. 6  Changes in (a) transmittance and (b) reflectance due to the moth-eye patterns on the PV protective glass. 
The optical properties of the PV protective glass patterned on the flat side were superior to those of PV protective glass patterned on the textured side. Indeed, the flat side is the one exposed to light thereby the amount of incident light which passes the moth-eye patterns is greater when these are formed on the flat side rather than on the textured side, leading to enhanced optical properties.
Moreover, when moth-eye patterns were formed on both sides of the PV protective glass, the transmittance increased by up to 3.13%, and the reflectance decreased by up to 3.42% compared with un-patterned glass. These results show that superior optical properties were enabled by the moth-eye patterns. The optical properties were especially enhanced in the visible spectral range (380–770 nm). Furthermore, since the refractive indices of air (nair = 1), UV-curable polysilsequioxane (nresin = 1.52), and glass (nglass = 1.52) increase sequentially, the anti-reflection effect is maximized.
In reality, light is incident on PV modules at various angles, so optical properties need to be measured as a function of angle. We therefore measured the transmittance of the PV protective glasses at angles of 15°, 30°, and 45°. As shown in Fig. 7, the transmittance of the moth-eye patterned PV protective glass increased at all angles with the PV protective glass patterned on both sides showing the highest values of transmittance. Total reflection can occur in PV modules when the angle of incidence is large. The results shown in Fig. 7(c) are therefore noteworthy given that even at the largest angle (θ = 45°), the moth-eye patterns lead to reduced reflection.

Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics were measured using a solar simulator (WXS-220S-L2.AM1.5GMM made by WACOM, USA). The electrical properties were all measured using the same solar cell and only the PV protective glass was changed for each measurement. The current densities (JSC) of all the patterned samples increased due to the enhanced optical properties of the fabricated moth-eye patterns, as shown in Fig. 8. Among the patterned samples, the JSC of the PV protective glass patterned on both sides was increased by up to 3.15% relative to the un-patterned glass. This result suggests that more electron–hole pairs were generated, helping to improve the efficiency of the PV module.

A monitoring system to measure the electricity generated by the PV modules
Finally, a monitoring system (Capture Star 1000B, ONTEST, Korea) was set up to measure electricity generated by the PV modules. Before measuring the generated power, we confirmed the efficiency differences between the PV modules as shown in Fig. 9(a). Each PV module (1–4) was assembled with un-patterned PV glass, moth-eye patterned PV glass only on the textured side, patterned PV glass only on the flat side and patterned PV glass on both sides. To obtain accurate results, the efficiencies of each PV module were normalized to PV module 1, which was assembled with un-patterned PV protective glass. Fig. 9(b) shows a schematic structure of a PV module with PV protective glass used in the monitoring system. A crystalline silicon solar cell (SC) was stacked on the printed circuit board (PCB). Subsequently, ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) was mounted on the stacked SC/PCB and a layer of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was used to protect the PV module. This PV module has a total size of 85 mm × 85 mm and the Pmax of this module is 0.8 W.

(b) Schematic structure of PV module with PV protective glass used in field tests. 
The PV modules with various types of protective glass were installed outdoors and monitored for 4 days. Fig. 10 shows the electrical power generated by each PV module over several days. Under direct irradiation (2013.10.04–2013.10.05; 1PM), the moth-eye effect became more effective and more light was absorbed by PV modules with moth-eye structures due to lower reflection from the surface of the protective glass. However, on cloudy days, the light was scattered more, the moth-eye anti-reflection layer became less effective, and the increase in generated power was smaller. Moth-eye anti-reflection is effective at all angles of incidence, as seen in Fig. 7, and so, increases in power at the module level were higher than demonstrated by the characteristic I–V curve.

Details of the electricity generated at different periods are compared in Table 1. During a sunny period (2013.10.04), the total amount of power generated was enhanced by 12.16% by the PV protective glass patterned on both sides compared with the PV module with un-patterned PV protective glass. The gain in power varied from day to day, but PV protective glasses with moth-eye patterns always generated more power than un-patterned glass.

Conclusions
In this study, H-NIL technology was used to enhance the conversion efficiency of PV modules. Moth-eye patterns, a type of anti-reflection layer, were formed on PV protective glass. These moth-eye patterns had a width of 250–350 nm and a height of 233.52 nm and resulted in enhanced optical properties. Transmittance was increased by up to 3.13% and reflectance decreased by 3.42%. Furthermore, the transmittance was increased for all incident angles. Due to these enhanced optical properties, the JSC of a single solar cell was increased by up to 3.15%. Finally, monitoring systems were set up and the total amount of power generated at the module level was enhanced by up to 12.16%.
