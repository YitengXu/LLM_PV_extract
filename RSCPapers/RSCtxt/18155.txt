    , Accepted 14th April 2021First published on 14th April 2021AbstractDue to barrierless free charge generation, low charge trapping, and high charge mobilities, the PM6:Y6 organic solar cell (OSC) achieves an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.7%. However, the deficient hole transfer from Y6 to PM6 limits the further enhancement of the device performance. Herein, we demonstrate an additive-induced miscibility and morphology control strategy to achieve the balance of exciton dissociation and charge collection, prompting an increase in the PCE of OSCs composed of PM6:Y6 from 15.7% to 17.5%, which stands as the top PCE value of PM6:Y6 binary OSCs. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the optimal device significantly improves in the wavelength range where Y6 harvests photons. Therefore, the short-circuit current density (JSC) was enhanced to 26.98 mA cm−2, achieving 94.4% of the maximum theoretical JSC obtained from the identical device configuration. The remarkable performance enhancement mainly results from the miscibility-driven donor and acceptor phase optimization with hierarchical morphology formation, leading to the improved photon-to-electron response of the Y6 phase, enhanced and balanced charge extraction and collection. Our findings highlight the significance of morphology control towards unleashing the full potential of OSC materials.

Broader context
In the last decade, solution-processed bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) that have drawn extensive attention from Physicists, Chemists, Materials Scientists, and industrialization experts attributed it to their short energy payback time, low carbon footprint, and facile manufacture into flexible, lightweight, and semitransparent devices. Tremendous efforts have been made in photoactive material designs, device engineering, and device physics, leading to the continual breakthrough in OSCs with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 17%. However, the technique for reaching the full potential of the existing photoactive material is rarely studied. To this end, we report an additive-induced morphology manipulation strategy to unleash the full potential of the existing state-of-the-art photoactive materials, namely, 4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)-4-fluorothiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT-F) and 1,3-bis(thiophen-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo-[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD) (PM6) and (2,20-((2Z,20Z)-((12,13-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-e]thieno[2′′,30′:4′,50]thieno[20,30:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[20,30:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]indole-2,10-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile) (Y6). As a result, the PCEs of the PM6:Y6 devices are boosted from 15.7% to 17.5%, which prompts the PCE of this system to a brand new level and highlights the importance of morphology control.

Introduction
Solution-processed bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have emerged as an excellent rival for the next-generation photovoltaic technology, attributed to their short energy payback time, low carbon footprint, and facile manufacture into flexible, lightweight, and semitransparent devices.1–10 The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs have been steadily rising in the past decade on account of tremendous efforts in photoactive material designs, device engineering, and device physics.11–13 Particularly, the development of the fused-ring electron acceptor Y6 pushed the PCE over 15% by pairing selected polymer donors.14,54 To further enhance the photovoltaic performance, a series of Y6 derivatives have been synthesized and the PCE for single-junction binary BHJ OSCs has exceeded 17%.15 While the research focus is usually concentrated on the advancement of photoactive material structures, the strategies to further release the potential of the reported photovoltaic materials still lag far behind. Taking the benchmark active layer PM6:Y6 as an example, the superior solar cell performance was attributed to the barrierless free charge generation, low charge trapping, and high charge mobilities. At the same time, the fast Y6 exciton decay led to deficient hole transfer from Y6 to PM6 as compared to the electron transfer efficiency from PM6 to Y6, limiting the photovoltaic device performance.16 This observation indicates that there are substantial opportunities for further efficiency enhancement by approaching the optimum active layer morphology and full light-harvesting potential. Thus, developing a technique to fulfill the PCE growth on commercial photoactive material is of importance to the advance of OSCs.
Reaching the full potential of the existing state-of-the-art photoactive materials requires superior active layer morphology, including more suitable domain size, donor/acceptor (D/A) phase separation, and D/A interfaces to ensure improved exciton dissociation, and more reasonable crystallinity, as well as domain purity for the achievement of enhanced charge transport.17–19 In this scenario, the miscibility of the donor and acceptor is a key factor in determining the quality of such a morphology.20–22 Generally, low miscibility can be considered as the driving force of phase segregation, which tends to form large and pure domains that facilitate charge transport. On the contrary, high miscibility offers a low driving force for phase separation, which tends to deliver small and impure domains that aid exciton dissociation. Thus, balanced exciton dissociation and charge transport can be obtained through miscibility-driven phase separation control. The miscibility of the donor and acceptor is estimated by the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter χ, and it can be either calculated by the melting-point depression method or obtained from the equation of K(γ1/2donor − γ1/2acceptor)2, where K is a positive constant,23,24 and γdonor and γacceptor are the surface energy values of donor and acceptor calculated from the contact angle measurements, respectively.23,25,26 When the melting-point depression method was applied, free-standing films with various donor/acceptor contents were measured with differential scanning calorimetry, and approximations were applied during the calculation. To reduce the materials consumption in the melting-point depression method and avoid approximation, the contact angle measurement-based method was more widely adopted.
To date, a few avenues have been proven effective to fine-tune the miscibility towards optimal morphology: (i) the modification of photoactive materials; (ii) the construction of ternary OSCs. The first approach was widely applied to achieve efficient OSCs. The Cao group designed a series of polymeric donors with different side chains, namely PTAZ-TPD10-Cn (n = 6, 8, 10). The miscibility of the donor and PC71BM increased with the lengthened side chains; as a comparison, N2200- and ITIC-based blends show an opposite trend. The lower-miscibility TPD10-Cn: acceptor system exhibited more intermixed morphology, contracted domains, and favorable vertical phase distribution. As a result, PTAZ-TPD10-C6:PC71BM, PTAZ-TPD10-C10:N2200, and PTAZ-TPD10-C10:ITIC can achieve the optimal efficiencies of 6.3%, 6.8%, and 8.8%, respectively.27 Recently, the Li group reported a series of D–A1–D–A2 type terpolymer donors via a random ternary polymerization strategy by incorporating 0%, 20%, 50%, and 100% content of thiophene-thiazolothiazole (TTz) building blocks into the skeleton of the state-of-the-art polymer (PM6). They found that the surface energies of the polymer were gradually reduced with the growing content of TTz. PM1 with 20% TTz incorporation possesses the optimum D/A miscibility, which results in the appropriate phase separation and phase purity and contributes to the excellent fill factor (FF) of 78% and PCE of 17.6%.28 Introducing the third component is another viable means to fine-tuning the miscibility. Baran demonstrated the practice by the replacement of 30% host non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) IDTBR with IDFBR, which has higher miscibility with P3HT. The partial incorporation of IDFBR thus reduced the phase separation in the corresponding device, which leads to the enhanced charge transfer and the improved short-circuit current density (JSC) and FF. Consequently, P3HT:IDTBR:IDFBR obtained a PCE of 7.7%, higher than the PCE of P3HT:IDTBR (6.3%).29 For another instance, to improve the performance of all-small-molecule (ASM) BTR-Cl:Y6 devices, the fine regulation of the miscibility via incorporating fullerene derivatives as the third component was reported. According to the surface energies, it was found that the miscibility of PC71BM/Y6 and BTR-Cl/PC71BM is higher than that of BTR-Cl/Y6, which leads to a better mixed D/A phase with a more reasonable domain size contributing to charge separation. PCE of 15.34% and FF of 77.11% in ASM OSCs have validated the effectiveness of the miscibility-driven morphology manipulation approach.30 Nevertheless, considerable efforts are required either in the chemical synthesis or in the selection of the third component, and more straightforward approaches to control the miscibility of commercial organic semiconductors to optimize the OSCs have rarely been reported.
Herein, a simple yet effective additive-induced miscibility control approach towards superior morphology is introduced to further release the potential of the state-of-the-art commercial polymer donor:acceptor system (PM6 and Y6). The solvent additive 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) has been the most reported to fine-tune the morphology of PM6:Y6 OSC, yielding enhanced 15.7% efficiency as compared to its non-additive (NA) counterpart (15%). In this work, we explored the effects of solvent additives by replacing the halogen element Cl in the CN molecule with F and Br, namely 1-fluoronaphthalene (FN) and 1-bromonaphthalene (BN).31,32 We surprisingly found that the halogen element can have a significant influence on the fine-tuning of the morphology: the FN-induced medium miscibility of PM6/Y6 led to optimal phase separation with champion exciton dissociation efficiency of 98.29% and PCE of 17.5%; CN-induced low miscibility of D/A resulted in excessive phase separation with reduced exciton dissociation efficiency of 94.96% and PCE of 15.7%; BN-induced high miscibility of D/A caused insufficient phase segregation with relatively low exciton dissociation efficiency of 95.45% and PCE of 16.4%. It is worth noting that the 17.5% efficiency achieved by the FN-induced miscibility control strategy stands as the champion PCE value of PM6:Y6 binary OSCs. The improved photon-to-electron response of the Y6 phase leads to the enhancement of the photocurrent density to 26.98 mA cm−2, which is 94.4% of the maximum theoretical photocurrent density obtained from optical simulations. The remarkable enhancement of FF from 70.6% (NA) to 77.8% (FN) soundly proves the effectiveness of this approach on the delicate morphology manipulation, which also paves the way for further releasing the potential of the existing OSC systems.
Results and discussion
The optoelectronic properties of PM6:Y6 and the solvent additives used in this work are presented in Fig. 1. The molecular structures of PM6, Y6, and additives of FN, CN, and BN are shown in Fig. 1a. Fig. 1b depicts the photovoltaic device architecture that obtained a PCE of 15.7%. Fig. 1c presents the normalized UV-vis absorbance spectra of the neat films of PM6 and Y6, and the blend film of PM6:Y6. The absorption maxima of the PM6 and Y6 films were at 609 and 826 nm, which are capable of complementary photon absorption. The PM6 and Y6 films exhibited absorption onsets of 677 and 932 nm, respectively, which account for the respective optical bandgaps of 1.83 and 1.33 eV. Fig. 1d displays the energy level diagram of PM6 and Y6. PM6 possesses the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of −3.50 eV and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of −5.56 eV, which match well with Y6 (−4.10 eV/−5.65 eV).

Prior to discussing the experimental performance of the devices, we performed a transfer matrix model simulation to get the maximum theoretical short circuit current density. The refractive index and extinction coefficient of the active layer were determined by ellipsometry measurements, and samples were prepared following the reported procedure.33,34 When unity internal quantum efficiency and identical device configurations (Fig. 1b) were used in the simulation, the maximum short circuit current density of 28.58 mA cm−2 was obtained, i.e., the full photocurrent density potential of such devices (details are given in Fig. S3–S5, ESI†). Next, the performance of the BHJ devices was optimized by varying the additives to fine-tune the miscibility of the PM6/Y6 phase toward enhanced device performance (Tables S1–S5, ESI†). Table 1 summarizes the figures of merit of the PM6:Y6-based devices subjected to different additives under simulated AM1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2). Fig. 1e summarizes the reported work with the champion PCE based on binary PM6:Y6 BHJ OSCs. To the best of our knowledge, this FN-induced miscibility control strategy prompted the PCE of the binary PM6:Y6 BHJ OSCs to a brand new level. Fig. 1f depicts the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of NA, FN, CN, and BN-based devices. The active layer of the control NA-based device shows a low χdonor–acceptor value of 4.65 × 10−2 K, implying the very high miscibility of PM6/Y6, which resulted in a PCE of 15.0% with a JSC of 24.99 mA cm−2 and FF of 70.6%. The introduction of CN significantly improved the χdonor–acceptor value to 53.13 × 10−2 K, indicating the dramatically decreased miscibility of PM6/Y6, and leading to the slightly enhanced device performance of 15.7% efficiency with a JSC of 25.79 mA cm−2 and FF of 71.9%, also in accordance with the reported work.14 When changing the solvent additive to BN, the corresponding active layer achieved the χdonor–acceptor value of 6.76 × 10−2 K and increased device performance of 16.4% efficiency with a JSC of 26.00 mA cm−2 and FF of 74.9%. The obviously enhanced PCE of the BN-based device with a slightly changed χdonor–acceptor value as compared to the NA-based counterpart indicated that fine-tuning the miscibility of PM6/Y6 is of significance to boosting the device performance.20,34 The utilization of FN has resulted in the χdonor–acceptor value of 10.98 × 10−2 K with a remarkably enhanced photovoltaic performance of 17.5% efficiency with a JSC of 26.98 mA cm−2 and FF of 77.8%. The miscibility of the FN-based BHJ active layer was between the CN and BN-based counterparts, meaning that the medium miscibility is preferential for achieving the top-performing PM6:Y6-based OSCs. The JSC of the FN-based device reached 94.4% of the maximum short circuit current density, which is higher than those obtained from devices with other processing conditions. These results prove the effectiveness of further improving the photovoltaic performance of commercial photoactive materials via the additive-induced miscibility/morphology manipulation strategy.

Fig. 1g presents the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the NA, FN, CN, and BN-based devices. The EQE curves of all four devices are very similar in shape, however, the FN exhibited a stronger photon-to-electron response than those of the NA, CN, and BN devices in the range of 340–830 nm, which contributes to the enhanced JSC. The EQE maximum of the FN-based device was 89.3%, which was higher as compared to that of the NA device 85.8%, CN device 85.3%, and BN device 84.9%. It is worth mentioning that the FN-induced miscibility control strategy remarkably increased the EQE from 525–830 nm, which means that the FN-induced medium miscibility of the PM6/Y6 can trigger the photon to electron response from the Y6 phase. The JSC values of the NA, FN, CN, and BN-based BHJ devices integrated from the EQE spectra were 24.06, 26.31, 24.91, and 25.40 mA cm−2, respectively, consistent with the JSC values measured from the solar simulator (within a 2.5% error for FN and BN-based BHJ devices, and within a 3.4% error for NA and CN-based BHJ devices, Table 1).
The photocurrent density (Jph) as a function of the effective voltage (Veff) was plotted to study the charge generation and extraction properties (Fig. 1h). Jph = JL − JD, where JL is the current density under illumination and JD is that in the dark. Veff = V0 − VA, where V0 is the voltage when Jph is equal to 0, and VA is the applied bias voltage. At a high Veff of 2.5 V, the gross photogenerated excitons were assumed to be dissociated into free charge carriers and then collected by electrodes. The FN-based BHJ device exhibited a saturated current density (Jsat) of 27.45 mA cm−2, which is higher as compared to the NA (26.79 mA cm−2), CN (27.16 mA cm−2), and BN-based BHJ devices (27.24 mA cm−2), in line with the photon harvesting capability of these four blends. The exciton dissociation efficiency (ηdiss = JSC/Jsat) and charge collection efficiency (ηcoll = Jmax power/Jsat) were calculated under short-circuit and maximum power output conditions, respectively.35 The FN-based device had a ηdiss of 98.29% and a ηcoll of 88.42%, higher than those of the NA (ηdiss of 93.28% and ηcoll of 79.32%), CN (ηdiss of 94.96% and ηcoll of 84.39%) and BN-based devices (ηdiss of 95.45% and ηcoll of 84.80%), indicating that the FN-induced miscibility control maximized and balanced the exciton dissociation and charge collection to release the full potential of the PM6:Y6 OSCs.
The above analysis indicates that the key factor governing the high-performing FN-based device originates from the optimal morphology control and, therefore, we checked the detailed changes in the thin films with and w/o solvent additives. Time-resolved in situ UV-vis absorption measurements (Fig. 2a–d) were performed to unveil the absorption transformation under the optimal post-treatment conditions (thermal annealing at 110 °C for 10 min) for the PM6:Y6 system. We have shown that NA, CN, and BN-based blend films all exhibit an obvious and sharp absorption transformation on the Y6 phase between 5–10 s. However, the FN-based blend film presented a smooth red-shifted absorption transformation on the Y6 phase, which is attributed to the FN-induced miscibility manipulation that slows down the crystallization. The fast crystallization normally results in relatively irregular orientation and more defects. Thus, the FN-based blend film showed stronger photon harvesting capacity on the Y6 phase, which accounts for the EQE (525–830 nm) enhancement. The corresponding absorption spectra under TA of 0 and 45s are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†).

Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was carried out to study the molecular packing and orientation in the thin films, and the corresponding GIWAXS parameters are summarized in Table S6 (ESI†). The additives have different impacts on PM6 and Y6 neat films. The additives of FN, CN, and BN increasingly improved the crystallinity of PM6 (Fig. S7, ESI†); however, the FN-induced Y6 neat film had high crystallinity, and the BN- and CN-induced Y6 neat film had medium and low crystallinity (Fig. S7, ESI†). For the blend films processed by different additives, all the BHJ blend films demonstrated similar molecule orientations. (Fig. 2e–h) The FN-based BHJ film with the medium miscibility of PM6/Y6 displayed (100) lamellar peaks at qxy ≈ 0.32 Å−1 (coherence length (CCL) = 5.33 nm) (Fig. 2f and Fig. S8, ESI†). In comparison, the CN-based counterpart with the low miscibility of PM6/Y6 exhibited the (100) lamellar peaks at qxy ≈ 0.32 Å−1 (CCL = 7.96 nm) and the BN-based counterpart with the high miscibility of PM6/Y6 presented the same peak at qxy ≈ 0.33 Å−1 (CCL = 4.87 nm). The (010) π–π stacking depicted the identical tendency (Fig. 2e–h and Fig. S8, ESI†). The FN-based BHJ film exhibited (010) π–π peaks at qz ≈ 1.69 Å−1 with CCL = 1.70 nm, whereas its CN analog exhibited qz ≈ 1.70 Å−1 with CCL = 1.86 nm, and the BN analog displayed qz ≈ 1.69 Å−1 with CCL = 1.58 nm. Generally, high crystallinity results in strong phase aggregation with a reduced D/A interface, whereas low crystallinity leads to weak phase aggregation with an increased D/A interface.34 The identical molecule orientation and the medium CCL of both the lamellar and π–π peaks in the FN-based BHJ film with the medium miscibility of PM6/Y6 finely improved and balanced the exciton dissociation (98.29%) and charge collection (88.42%), endowing the full potential of PM6:Y6 binary OSCs with 17.5% efficiency.
The PM6/Y6 phase separation in the BHJ active layer was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 2i–p) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. S10, ESI†). As demonstrated by the AFM height images, the FN-induced BHJ film with medium miscibility of PM6/Y6 has a root mean square roughness (Rq) value of 1.03 nm (Fig. 2j), which is smaller than its CN-induced counterpart with the low miscibility of PM6/Y6 (Fig. 2k, Rq = 1.13 nm), and larger than its BN-induced counterpart with the high miscibility of PM6/Y6 (Fig. 2l, Rq = 0.93 nm), implying that this additive-induced miscibility manipulation approach can finely control the molecular aggregation, which is in line with the trend of crystallinity ascertained by GIWAXS test (Fig. 2e–h and Fig. S7, ESI†). As the AFM phase images (Fig. 2m–p) indicate, relative to the CN and BN-based BHJ films, the FN-based film exhibited a very interesting hierarchical morphology, in which clear fibril (polymer) structures can be seen to be closely attached to or even embedded into larger grain structures. We suspect that this hierarchical morphology with both D–A phase purity and intimate contact may provide a more efficient model for charge separation and transport and it could become a critical factor for boosting the photovoltaic performance of the PM6:Y6-based OSCs.36–40 Similar to GIWAXS characterization, the solvent additives have different impacts on the PM6 and Y6 phases, respectively. Only a small variation can be found from the PM6 phase (Fig. S10, ESI†) with the Rq order of NA (0.80 nm) < FN (0.81 nm) < CN (0.83 nm) < BN (0.88 nm), whereas an obvious difference can be discovered from the Y6 phase (Fig. S11, ESI†) with the Rq order of NA (1.29 nm) < CN (1.44 nm) < BN (1.95 nm) < FN (2.52 nm). The remarkably enhanced photon response of the Y6 phase may have originated from the significantly increased Y6 phase aggregation, which also supports the hierarchical morphology scenario mentioned above. The order of the PM6/Y6 blend phase aggregation is distinct from both the pure PM6 and Y6 phases, meaning that the solvent additive is the key to manipulating the miscibility of the PM6/Y6 for the enhanced and balanced exciton dissociation and charge collection.
Inspired by the morphology analysis, we proposed the schematic drawing of the D/A interfaces in Fig. 2q–t. Due to the lowest crystallinity and highest miscibility of PM6/Y6 in the NA-based film, the two materials were well mixed but with fewer aggregation stacks as shown in Fig. 2q. The active layer obtained from the film with FN is pictured in Fig. 2r, indicating its medium miscibility and improved crystallinity; it has suitable mixed donors and acceptors at the D/A interfaces and a continuous pure phase that ensures the exciton dissociation and charge transport. Fig. 2s presents the D/A interface of CN processed PM6:Y6 with low miscibility and more pure domains, which should result in improved charge carrier mobilities. The slightly decreased miscibility of PM6/Y6 and improved crystallinity in the BN processed thin film can be observed in Fig. 2t, indicating better exciton dissociation efficiency in comparison with the NA and CN processed films. These morphology data systematically unveil the nature of additive-induced miscibility control towards enhanced photovoltaic performance.
The distinct thin film morphologies directly influence the behavior of the free charge carriers in the devices, thus J–V curves under various incident light intensities, and the transient photovoltage/photocurrent (TPV/TPC) were obtained.41–43 Previous studies have reported that the bimolecular recombination losses could be qualitatively analyzed by employing the power-law relation, JSC ∝ Iα to fit JSC as a function of the incident light intensity plotted in log scales.44,53 In short, a value of α equal to unity reflects the extreme case where all the free carriers are swept out and collected at the electrodes before recombination. From fitting the data of JSCvs. light intensity as illustrated in Fig. 3a, α values of 0.981, 0.998, 0.989, and 0.991 were obtained for NA, FN, CN, and BN-based BHJ devices, respectively, which are indicative of the negligible bimolecular recombination losses for all these systems. On the other hand, the presence of trap-assisted Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination can be distinguished from the ideality factor n. When the VOC was plotted as a function of the incident light intensity (Fig. 3b), the data followed the expression of VOC ∝ nKT/qln(I), where n, k, T, and q are the ideality factor, Boltzmann constant, temperature in Kelvin, and elementary charge, respectively.44,53 In this case, it indicates the presence of trap-assisted recombination if the n value deviates from 1 (trap-free condition). The fitted data shown in Fig. 3b presented n values of 1.28, 1.20, 1.27, and 1.22 for NA, FN, CN, and BN-based BHJ devices, respectively, indicating that the FN-induced medium miscibility of PM6/Y6 aiding this BHJ device suffers from the lowest trap-assisted recombination. These results reveal that finely manipulating the miscibility of PM6/Y6 via solvent additives can notably reduce the density of the trap-assisted recombination center, which accounts for the performance enhancement of PM6:Y6 devices.

Quantitative analysis of the charge recombination dynamics and extraction across BHJ active layers in devices were carried out by TPV and TPC characterizations. The carrier lifetimes (τ) under open-circuit conditions (Fig. 3c) were extracted from the TPV decay dynamics employing mono-exponential fits under a 1 Sun bias.36,45,46 The FN-based BHJ device exhibited a τ value of 1.44 μs, longer than its NA, CN, and BN-based counterparts (1.11,1.15 and 1.19 μs), in conformity to the weaker recombination in FN-induced medium miscible device. In addition to the charge recombination, charge extraction properties also play a key role. The competition between carrier sweep-out and recombination during the operation was determined through the TPC measurement (Fig. 3d). The photocurrent decay time under short-circuit conditions was 0.79 μs for the FN-based BHJ device, smaller than that for the NA (0.90 μs), CN (0.85 μs), and BN-based devices (0.84 μs), illustrating that the medium miscibility of PM6/Y6 in the BHJ device can effectively facilitate charge carrier extraction, which is in line with the aforementioned higher charge collection efficiency of 88.42% in the FN-based BHJ device (Fig. 1g).
To unveil the charge transport process, both hole and electron carrier mobilities were estimated by fitting the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) model.47–50 Hole-only devices were fabricated with the structure of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag and electron-only devices with the ITO/ZnO/PFNBr/Active layer/PFNBr/Ag. The FN-based device shows medium hole (5.24 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and electron (5.28 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) mobilities, higher than the NA-based (4.08 × 10−4 and 2.63 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and the BN-based devices (4.66 × 10−4 and 4.46 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), but lower than the CN-based device (7.34 × 10−4 and 5.55 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). However, the hole and electron mobility were more balanced (μe/μh = 0.99), which may account for the higher FF of 77.8% in the FN-based BHJ devices. Additionally, the hole and electron energy disorder (σh and σe) can be obtained from temperature-dependent mobility characterizations using the Gaussian disorder model (GDM):51,52  where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, μ0 is the zero-field mobility, and μ∞ is the mobility at infinite temperature. Fig. 3e and f depict the zero-field electron and hole mobilities of NA, FN, CN, and BN-based BHJ devices as a function of 1/T2. The FN-induced BHJ device with medium miscibility of PM/Y6 exhibited the σh value of 7.57 meV and σe value of 7.90 meV, whereas the CN-induced BHJ device with the low miscibility of PM/Y6, the BN-induced BHJ device with the high miscibility of PM/Y6, and the NA-based BHJ without manipulating the miscibility of PM/Y6, all presented higher values (σh = 14.0 meV, σe = 13.7 meV for CN; σh = 11.4 meV, σe = 11.3 meV for BN; and σh = 19.7 meV, σe = 20.9 meV for NA). The results indicate that the density of states (DoS) in the FN-based device is narrower as compared with those of the other devices. This feature is consistent with the reduced trap-assisted SRH recombination, suggesting that this additive-induced miscibility control strategy can suppress both hole and electron energetic disorder in the BHJ active layer, and thus fewer trapped states at the edge of the DoS, leading to the enhanced JSC of 26.98 mA cm−2 and FF of 77.8%.
Conclusions
In summary, we have reported a facile and effective additive-induced miscibility control approach to further prompt the PCE of the state-of-the-art PM6:Y6 system to increase from 15.7% to 17.5%, which stands as the top value for PM6:Y6 binary OSCs. We found that the additive-induced miscibility of PM6/Y6 changes led to the following: (1) a smooth Y6 crystallization process, which reduced defects and contributed to the enhanced acceptor photon response; (2) a hierarchical morphology with more suitable phase separation, thereby contributing to more efficient and balanced exciton dissociation and charge collection; (3) the reduced trap-assisted SRH recombination, which prolonged the carrier lifetime and suppressed the energetic disorder, contributing to the improvement of JSC and FF. Our findings demonstrate that there is plenty of room for OPV morphology regulation such as the additive-induced miscibility control strategy, which paves the way for reaching the full potential of the vast existing photoactive materials.

Broader context
In the last decade, solution-processed bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) that have drawn extensive attention from Physicists, Chemists, Materials Scientists, and industrialization experts attributed it to their short energy payback time, low carbon footprint, and facile manufacture into flexible, lightweight, and semitransparent devices. Tremendous efforts have been made in photoactive material designs, device engineering, and device physics, leading to the continual breakthrough in OSCs with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 17%. However, the technique for reaching the full potential of the existing photoactive material is rarely studied. To this end, we report an additive-induced morphology manipulation strategy to unleash the full potential of the existing state-of-the-art photoactive materials, namely, 4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)-4-fluorothiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT-F) and 1,3-bis(thiophen-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo-[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD) (PM6) and (2,20-((2Z,20Z)-((12,13-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-e]thieno[2′′,30′:4′,50]thieno[20,30:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[20,30:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]indole-2,10-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile) (Y6). As a result, the PCEs of the PM6:Y6 devices are boosted from 15.7% to 17.5%, which prompts the PCE of this system to a brand new level and highlights the importance of morphology control.
