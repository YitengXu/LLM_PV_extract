    , Accepted 15th January 2023First published on 16th January 2023AbstractBroadband photodetectors are a category of optoelectronic devices that have important applications in modern communication information. γ-InSe is a newly developed two-dimensional (2D) layered semiconductor with an air-stable and low-symmetry crystal structure that is suitable for polarization-sensitive photodetection. Herein, we report a P–N photodiode based on 3D Ge/2D γ-InSe van der Waals heterojunction (vdWH). A built-in electric field is introduced at the p-Ge/n-InSe interface to suppress the dark current and accelerate the separation of photogenerated carriers. Moreover, the heterojunction belongs to the accumulation mode with a well-designed type-II band arrangement, which is suitable for the fast separation of photogenerated carriers. Driven by these advantages, the device exhibits excellent photovoltaic performance within the detection range of 400 to 1600 nm and shows a double photocurrent peak at around 405 and 1550 nm. In particular, the responsivity (R) is up to 9.78 A W−1 and the specific detectivity (D*) reaches 5.38 × 1011 Jones with a fast response speed of 46/32 μs under a 1550 nm laser. Under blackbody radiation, the room temperature R and D* in the mid-wavelength infrared region are 0.203 A W−1 and 5.6 × 108 Jones, respectively. Moreover, polarization-sensitive light detection from 405–1550 nm was achieved, with the dichroism ratios of 1.44, 3.01, 1.71, 1.41 and 1.34 at 405, 635, 808, 1310 and 1550 nm, respectively. In addition, high-resolution single-pixel imaging capability is demonstrated at visible and near-infrared wavelengths. This work reveals the great potential of the γ-InSe/Ge photodiode for high-performance, broadband, air-stable and polarization-sensitive photodetection.
1. Introduction
As an optoelectronic component, photodetectors are widely used in military and civilian fields, including spectroscopy, telecommunications, astronomy, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and environmental monitoring.1–5 Compared with photodetectors operating within a specific wavelength range, broadband photodetectors with wider spectral responses are ideal for various applications.6,7 In addition, due to their important applications in high-contrast polarizers, optical switches, and navigation, polarization-sensitive photodetectors have aroused increasing research interest.8–10
Due to their ability to control channel thickness at the atomic level, the recently emerging two-dimensional (2D) materials allow improved gate control of the channel barrier, reduced short-channel effects, and improved cost and power consumption issues of large-scale device preparations.11 Moreover, 2D materials can modulate their bandgap by composition, thickness, strain and electric field.12–14 Typically, unlike most 2D materials with symmetric crystal structures, black phosphorus (BP) has a unique orthorhombic crystal structure in which each phosphorus atom is linked to three adjacent phosphorus atoms to form a stable contiguous ring structure consisting of six phosphorus atoms per ring.15 The folded BP structure leads to reduced symmetry, which makes BP possess angle-dependent photoelectric properties.
Benefiting from the light absorption coefficient covering the visible to near-infrared range, monolayer BP with a bandgap of 1.5 eV shows a high current on/off ratio of 105 and a field-effect electron mobility of up to 205 cm2 V−1 s−1 along the fixed direction.15 These excellent (opto)electronic properties confirm that BP has great potential for novel devices in ultra-fast electronics and infrared polarized photodetection. However, BP is susceptible to oxidation in air, limiting its further research and application. Other materials, including GeSe, SnS and Sb2S3, that exhibit the same low symmetry structure have also been developed as polarization-sensitive photodetectors.16–19 However, the above photodetectors based on individual material detectors require an external voltage supply. For example, a photodetector based on SnS delivers better performance in air with a high responsivity (R) of 635 A W−1 and an anisotropic photocurrent ratio of 1.7, which is less than 2.17,18
In general, γ-InSe, β-InSe and ε-InSe are three different crystal phases belonging to InSe, corresponding to the space groups of R3mh, P63/mmc and Pm2, respectively.20 Among them, the bandgap of γ-InSe depends on the number of layers, with a direct bandgap of 1.26 eV for the multilayered form and an indirect bandgap of 2.11 eV for the monolayered structure.21 Interestingly, γ-InSe has a different stacking order and a non-centrosymmetric space point group, similar to BP, which makes γ-InSe possess an asymmetric crystal structure. Simultaneously, specular symmetry exists in monolayer γ-InSe, while the inversion symmetry is broken in few layers, producing nonlinear optical phenomena such as second-harmonic generation. Furthermore, γ-InSe nanosheets can absorb broadband spectrum from visible to near-infrared light and their field-effect electron mobility is reported to be as high as 221 cm2 V−1 s−1. In particular, a γ-InSe-based photodetector exhibits a high R up to 127 A W−1 and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 104% with a photocurrent dichroism ratio of 2.06 at Vds = 1 V under 405 nm. In addition, unlike BP, γ-InSe is air-stable, which makes it a promising candidate for polarization-sensitive broadband photodetection under atmospheric conditions.22 To overcome the limitations of short carrier lifetime and light absorption of 2D materials,23,24 integrating 2D materials and three-dimensional (3D) semiconductor materials to form mixed-dimensional vdWH is an effective strategy. In these heterojunctions, optical absorption mainly occurs in 3D materials, while 2D materials usually serve as the photoactive layers for the separation and transport of photogenerated carriers. These heterojunctions are simple and easy to be artificially stacked by the dry or wet transfer method. Recently, Wang's group reported the fabrication of a mixed-dimensional PtSe2/Ge heterojunction-based infrared detector with a maximum R of 0.602 A W−1 under 1550 nm laser irradiation.25 The R value is still lower than commercial Ge near-infrared photodetectors (typically in the range of 0.85–0.95 A W−1). Moreover, such PtSe2/Ge heterojunction devices are almost incapable of detecting polarized light.
Herein, to achieve the detection of broadband and polarized light, we integrate γ-InSe and 3D Ge to form a self-driven mixed-dimensional γ-InSe/Ge vdWH. Compared with conventional Si, Ge shows a larger absorption coefficient and a narrower bandgap of 0.67 eV, which can further extend the photodetection range of the heterojunction. It presents polarization-sensitive, broadband and high-performance self-powered photodetection. The photodetection range of γ-InSe/Ge devices covers 400 nm to 1600 nm and shows two photocurrent peaks at around 405 and 1550 nm. A recorded high R of 9.78 A W−1, a high D* of 5.38 × 1011 Jones, a fast response time of 46/32 μs and the capability to image high-resolution visible-near infrared single-point at room temperature are achieved at zero bias under 1550 nm illumination. In addition, our fabricated γ-InSe/Ge device achieves various photocurrent anisotropic ratios of 1.44, 3.01, 1.71, 1.41 and 1.34 under 405 nm, 635 nm, 808 nm, 1310 nm and 1550 nm, respectively. Demonstrating the value of the device in practical applications, the device has a blackbody R of 0.203 A W−1 in the mid-wavelength infrared region in the photovoltaic mode and the D* is 5.6 × 108 cm Hz1/2 W−1 at room temperature.26 Our fabricated photodiode can be further used in single-pixel imaging systems with visible and near-infrared lasers. These results show that our γ-Se/Ge heterojunction photodetector has significant promise for next-generation high-performance, broadband, and polarization-sensitive photodetection applications.
2. Results and discussion
As known, γ-InSe belongs to the space group of R3mh with a specific stacking order of indium atoms aligned with selenium atoms in another layer, as shown in Fig. S1.† Instead of symmetrical β-InSe, the atomic structure of γ-InSe possesses a mirror asymmetry, indicating unique polarized characteristics in effective mass, photon and phonon vibration modes.27,28Fig. 1a shows a 3D schematic diagram of the designed γ-InSe/Ge vertical vdWH-based photodiode. The corresponding optical image can be seen in Fig. 1b. The fabrication process is also depicted in Fig. S2.†

(d) Photoluminescence spectrs of γ-InSe, Ge, and γ-InSe/Ge under 532 nm excitation.(e) AFM image at the interface between γ-InSe and Ge substrate. 
First of all, a 300-nm insulator layer of SiO2 is deposited onto the cleaned p-Ge substrate. Subsequently, an exposed Ge window can be achieved by using photolithography and wet etching methods.
To avoid the Fermi pinning effect, four electrodes E1, E2, E3 and E4 are deposited before the dry transfer of the mechanically exfoliated γ-InSe (see the Experimental section for details).29,30 The electrical properties of InSe (E1–E2) and Ge (E3–E4) and the overlapped region can be measured by testing the different electrode pairs. The overlapping area of γ-InSe and Ge is calculated to be about 410.74 μm2. Fig. 1c shows the typical Raman spectra of individual γ-InSe, Ge, and the overlapped region. For the blue curve, the three obvious Raman peaks at 113 cm−1, 176 cm−1 and 226 cm−1 correspond to the out-of-plane vibrational A1 modes (113 and 226 cm−1) and the in-plane Eg mode (176 cm−1) for multilayered γ-InSe.31 For the black curve, there is a distinct Raman peak at 300 cm−1 attributed to Ge–Ge bonding. For the red curve, four Raman peaks are attributed to the vibration modes of Ge and γ-InSe without shift and indicate a high-quality interface at Ge/InSe.
To confirm the optical bandgaps of InSe and charge transport across the interface, we tested the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of γ-InSe and γ-InSe/Ge at the positions of the red dashed circle and the blue dashed circle marked in Fig. 1b, respectively. Fig. 1d shows the PL spectra of γ-InSe and γ-InSe/Ge under 532 nm laser irradiation. Because of the direct bandgap of multilayered γ-InSe, a strong PL peak appears at around 990 nm, corresponding to the optical bandgap of 1.25 eV.32 In contrast, a significant PL quenching effect without any obvious shift is achieved in the γ-InSe/Ge region, indicating the effective photogenerated charge transport process between the 2D γ-InSe and the 3D Ge sides.33 Moreover, atomic force microscopy (AFM) is used to measure the thickness of exfoliated γ-InSe on the Ge window. As shown in Fig. 1e, γ-InSe is found to be about 121 nm thick with a clean and smooth surface. In order to investigate the energy band arrangement and the carrier transport mechanism of γ-InSe/Ge mixed vdWH, the surface potential difference (SPD) between Ge and InSe can be measured by using kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). The SPD between the KPFM tip and Ge or γ-InSe is measured according to the following equations:34 eSPDGe = (Wtip − WGe) = 415 meV(1) eSPDInSe = (Wtip − WInSe) = 252 meV(2)where e represents the quantity of electric charge. Wtip, WGe and WInSe represent the work function (WF) of the KPFM tip, Ge and γ-InSe, respectively. Wtip is already calibrated to be 4.95 eV by testing the SPD between highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG, WHOPG = 4.6 eV) and an Ir–Pt coated tip.35,36 Therefore, the WGe and WInSe values are calculated to be about 4.535 eV and 4.698 eV. Moreover, the difference in the WF between Ge and γ-InSe, called the average Fermi level difference (ΔEf), can be obtained through the following equation:34 ΔEf = eSPDGe − eSPDInSe = (WInSe − WGe) = 163 meV(3)  As shown in Fig. 2a, the electric potential of p-Ge is higher than that of γ-InSe. The ΔEf along the blue line is calculated to be about 163 meV with a lateral depletion region width (W) of 5.6 μm. After contact, a strong lateral built-in electric field exists at the γ-InSe/Ge interface, pointing from the Ge side to the InSe side. In general, the values of the conduction band minimum (CBM) and the valence band maximum (VBM) for Ge and γ-InSe can be extracted according to the previous studies.31,37,38 As shown in Fig. S3,† a designed type-II energy band diagram before contact is depicted, and the band offsets of the CBM (ΔEc) and VBM (ΔEv) for Ge and InSe are calculated to be about 0.47 eV and 1.04 eV, respectively. After contact, the electrons at the Ef of Ge can diffuse to InSe, while a number of positive charge centers are left on the Ge side. The opposite phenomenon can be also seen on the InSe side. In detail, the band edge will slightly bend upward on the Ge side, while it will obviously bend downward on the InSe side until the formation of the same Fermi level. In particular, the band bending on the Ge or InSe side is totally different because of the distinctive electric conductivity or carrier concentration (see Fig. S4†). As a result, a built-in electric field of 163 meV with an accumulation mode is constructed and pointed from p-Ge to n-InSe in Fig. 2b. Under these thermal equilibrium conditions, a majority of the electrons in the InSe side can be driven across the depletion region to the CBM of Ge, while a majority of holes in the Ge side are difficult to be driven to the InSe side because of the large band offset. Therefore, partial holes or electrons can accumulate on the Ge or InSe side.

(f) Time-resolved photoresponse behavior under different incident wavelengths. 
The photodetection performance of the γ-InSe/Ge vdWH in the self-driven mode is systematically investigated. E2 and E4 shown in Fig. 1b are determined to be the drain (D) and source (S) terminals, respectively. Fig. 2c shows the wavelength-dependent normalized photocurrent spectroscopy at a fixed light power density of 4.5 mW cm−2 at Vds = 0 V. Significantly, it shows two clear and optimal photocurrent peaks at around 405 nm (InSe domination) and 1550 nm (Ge domination). This result is rarely reported in other 2D materials/Ge photodiodes and will be discussed in depth by the band alignment under visible and near-infrared light later. The obvious photocurrent generation can be ascribed to the strong visible light absorption of the multilayered InSe part with direct bandgap and the unique, efficient carrier transport through the type-II band alignment.39Fig. 2d shows the Ids–Vds curves in the dark, confirming a forward rectification behavior with a rectification ratio of 24 in such p–n junctions. Meanwhile, the electrical properties of bare InSe and Ge by measuring the E1–E2 and E3–E4 electrodes in Fig. 1b are also shown in Fig. S4.† Both Ids–Vds curves exhibit linear symmetry, indicating an ohmic contact between Cr/Au and Ge (InSe). Thus, the rectification behavior is determined by the hetero-interface. Moreover, the ideality factor (n) can be calculated by using the Shockley diode formula from the Richardson Dushman thermionic emission theory:40 (4)where q, k0, T, and J represent the electron charge, the Boltzmann constant, the temperature, and the current density, respectively. After fitting the curve in the range of 0 to 0.3, the n value of 1.21 (close to 1) can be extracted. Therefore, a high-quality junction at the Ge/InSe interface is confirmed and the diffusion current dominates the forward current region.41,42Fig. 2e shows the Ids–Vds curves at the semi-logarithmic scale in the dark and under irradiation at various wavelengths. Remarkably, both open-circuit voltage (Voc) and short-circuit current (Isc) can be obtained at wavelengths ranging from 405 nm to 1550 nm by the photovoltaic effect from the p–n junction. Fig. 2f shows the corresponding time-resolved switching on–off curves under irradiation at various wavelengths at similar light power densities. As a result, it can deliver a fast and stable photoresponse behavior in the 405 nm to 1550 nm wavelength range at zero bias. Specifically, on-state Ids values of 286 nA at 405 nm (16.48 mW cm−2), 121 nA at 635 nm (15.60 mW cm−2), 96 nA at 808 nm (14.21 mW cm−2), 139 nA at 980 nm (18.07 mW cm−2), and 166 nA at 1310 nm (18.7 mW cm−2), and 339 nA at 1550 nm (15.41 mW cm−2) are obtained, which are consistent with the results of Fig. 2c.
The self-driven performance under 405 nm and 1550 nm irradiation will be further analyzed as follows. Fig. S7a and S7b† show the Ids–Vds curves under 405 nm and 1550 nm irradiation under various light power densities (P). The reverse current and Isc monotonously increase with light power density increasing, thus confirming the photovoltaic and photoconductive effects at zero bias and negative bias, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3a and d, it can be switched on and off quickly with reproducibility under a pulsed laser at zero bias for photodetection. In general, the output electrical power (Pel) is plotted by the equation:43 Pel = IdsVds(5)

(b) and (e) Pel as a function of Vds at various light power densities. (c) and (f) Logarithmic plots of Isc and Vocversus light power density. 
The maximum Pel can reach 3.46 nW (7.95 nW) at Vds = 22 mV (38 mV) at input P of 219.26 mW cm−2 (26.91 mW cm−2) under 405 nm (1550 nm) as shown in Fig. 3b and e. Fig. 3c and f show that both Isc and Voc under 405 nm (1550 nm) irradiation monotonously increase with the increase in light power density, which are extracted from Fig. S7c and S7d.† In particular, the maximum values of Isc and Voc are 61.5 nA (817 nA) and 22 mV (38 mV), respectively. A power law function of Iph ∝ Pa is used to figure out the photocharge recombination rate. As a result, the fitting exponent indices of a are around 0.62 and 0.75 under 405 nm and 1550 nm, respectively. The fitting index deviates from 1, which indicates that the Auger recombination mainly occurred at the heterointerface. The photogenerated charges are partially trapped by the defect states, which is also reported in other vdWH photodetectors:44
In addition, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and fill factor (FF) represent the parameters of how much of the incident photon energy can be converted into effective electrical energy and the ability of the device to provide maximum output power to the outside world, respectively, both of which are key quality parameters of photovoltaic cells, which are defined as:45,46 (6) (7)
As shown in Fig. 4a and d, maximum PCE values of 0.38% and 7% can be obtained under 405 nm and 1550 nm laser, respectively. In particular, the PCE at 1550 nm reaches 7%, which indicates the device can efficiently perform the photoelectric conversion, revealing its great potential for applications in near-infrared photovoltaic devices. Meanwhile, a FF of up to 0.256 (0.24) also indicates that our research has great potential in solar energy under 405 nm (1550 nm). Compared to PdSe2/Ge,25 our devices are far more useful for solar cell applications and near-infrared optoelectronics.

(g) The blackbody test system. Energy band bending diagrams under (h) visible light and (i) infrared light irradiation. 
Furthermore, EQE represents the ratio of the number of collected charges to the number of effective photogenerated carriers excited by the incident photons. The equation is as follows:47 (8)where h and λ are the Planck constant and excitation wavelength, respectively. An EQE value of 203% (408%) and an Ilight/Idark ratio of 284 (1158) are obtained under P of 219.26 mW cm−2 (26.91 mW cm−2), as shown in Fig. 4b and e. The anomaly of EQE > 100% in photovoltaic devices may be due to the photoconductive gain effect formed by the interface trap states and the accumulation of photogenerated holes (electrons) on the Ge (InSe) side. In addition, R and D* represent the capacity of the photodetector to generate photocurrent under illumination and the sensitivity to weak incident light, respectively. They can be expressed as:48,49 (9) (10)where Iph is the net photocurrent, S reflects the effectively illuminated area (S = 410.07 μm2), and Sn is the noise spectral density calculated by the Fourier transformation of the dark current trace. Furthermore, the Sn as a function of frequency is depicted by Fourier transformation in Fig. S5.† At low frequencies, a 1/f noise component is observed, which is attributed to interface defects. At high frequencies (10 Hz), it reaches the background noise with a very low white noise (Sn = 8.36 × 1013 A Hz−1/2). The low white noise is close to the scattered grain background noise.50–53 When the light power intensities are 0.75 mW cm−2 (0.63 mW cm−2) under 405 nm (1550 nm) illumination, the corresponding R can reach the maximum values of 0.88 A W−1 (9.87 A W−1) and D* can simultaneously reach 4.88 × 1010 Jones (5.43 × 1011 Jones), as shown in Fig. 4c and f. In particular, an ultra-high R value of 9.87 A W−1 under a 1550 nm laser far exceeds that of other Ge-based vdWH photodiodes, such as PtSe2/Ge (0.62 A W−1), PdSe2/Ge (0.53 A W−1), WSe2/Ge (1.3 A W−1), etc.25,54,55
The blackbody response is an important parameter that reflects the sensitivity of infrared photodetectors and determines the practical applications.56 A schematic diagram of the blackbody detection system is given in Fig. 4g. The details are in the Experimental section. The room temperature R and D* of the heterojunction in the photovoltaic mode under a 1000 K blackbody source illumination can be obtained by the equations of (9) and (10). The results are calculated as 0.203 A W−1 and 5.6 × 108 Jones at the blackbody power density of 147 mW, respectively. It indicates the great potential of our device for practical applications in the infrared detection region.57–60
The intrinsic mechanism of the double photocurrent peak photodetection and the ultra-high R and PCE under 1550 nm laser is demonstrated in Fig. 4g and h. When visible light of 405 nm is applied, a number of photogenerated carriers can be mainly excited in the band structure of bare InSe and the depletion region near the InSe side. Those electrons can be directly stimulated towards the CBM of InSe with a direct bandgap and driven to the CBM of Ge across the ΔEc energy barrier under the built-in electric field. At the same time, the electrons from the Ge side can be also motivated to the CBM of InSe through the intralayer transition. While the holes in the VBM of InSe can efficiently go back to the D terminal, resulting in a negative Isc and fast response. In contrast, there are a few photoexcited holes located at the VBM of Ge. It is difficult for them to transmit across the large ΔEv band offset. Therefore, the photovoltaic performance in the visible range is dominated by the InSe part. Under illumination by near-infrared light of 1550 nm, only the photogenerated charge exists in bare Ge and the depletion region near the Ge side. They can be also stimulated to the CBM of InSe with the help of intralayer transmission through the small band offset of 0.21 eV between CBMlnSe and VBMGe. In particular, a number of the holes accumulated at the Ge side can be transported or tunneled across the potential barrier, dominating the near-infrared photovoltaic performance.55,61,62
Furthermore, in Fig. S6,† after 1400 (800) multiple switching on–off cycles of operation, the device photocurrent performance in the Isc state undergoes almost no degradation under visible and near-infrared light, thus confirming the stability and reproducibility of the fabricated photodiode. The response speed represents the ability of the photodetectors to track a rapidly changing optical signal, which is important for ultra-fast photodetection. The response speed of the InSe/Ge heterojunction photodiode is evaluated by modulating the frequency of the pulsed optical signal. Fig. 5a–d show the times-resolved photoresponse behaviors at different frequencies of 111 Hz, 1 kHz, 10 kHz, and 20 kHz under 1550 nm illumination, respectively, showing a stable and fast response to all rapidly changing signals. By analyzing the relative balance of (Imax − Imin)/Imax at different frequencies in Fig. 5e, a wide frequency response range over 40 kHz and a high 3 dB cut off frequency of about 13 kHz (the photoresponse decreases to 70.71% of its maximum value), indicating that the device is capable of tracking ultra-fast switching optical signals over a wide range of switching frequencies.63 In addition, a rise time (τrise: photocurrent rises from 10% to 90% of its final value)/decay time (τdecay: photocurrent falls from 90% to 10% of its start value) of 46/32 μs can be inferred by calculating the enlarged switching on/off cycle at 111 Hz in Fig. 5a.64,65

Because of the low symmetric structure of γ-InSe, the polarization-dependent optical correlation of InSe/Ge vdWH will be analyzed. As shown in Fig. S8,† a polarizer is placed between the light source and the photodetector, which converts the incident light into polarized light with a controlled polarization angle. The polarized photocurrent at various rotation angles under the wavelengths 405, 635, 808, 1310 and 1550 are displayed in Fig. S9.† In particular, the optimal wavelength for good polarization-sensitive detection is 635 nm. Fig. S9a† demonstrates the time-resolved photoresponse behaviors at different polarization angles ranging from 0° to 360°. It shows a periodic variation of 180°, with the maximum and minimum values occurring at 60° (240°) and 150° (330°) at 635 nm, respectively. Fig. 6a shows the polarization-dependent current mapping of the heterojunction photodetector under 635 nm illumination from Vds = −1 V to 0 V. Intuitively, as shown in Fig. 6b, the photocurrent as a function of polarization angle shows a stable period of 180° and exhibits a strong polarization sensitivity. In order to visually explore the photocurrent at each angle, correlation of the photocurrent to the polarization angle is performed using the following function simulation:66 Id = Imaxcos2(θ) + Iminsin2(θ)(11)where θ is the rotation angle of the laser polarization direction with respect to the a-axis of the InSe nanosheet and Imax and Imin are the maximum and minimum photocurrents, respectively. Notably, the photodiode exhibits a rather good photocurrent anisotropic ratio (Imax/Imin) of 3.01 at 635 nm (0.21 mW cm−2), and the polar diagram is shown in Fig. 6c, which is due to the in-plane anisotropic crystal structure and the good photoresponse in visible light of γ-InSe and the effective built-in electric field with type-II band alignment. The photocurrent anisotropic ratio under 405 nm (15.41 mW cm−2), 808 nm (5.33 mW cm−2), 1310 nm (8.81 mW cm−2) and 1550 nm (32.64 mW cm−2) lasers are found to be 1.44, 1.71, 1.41 and 1.34, respectively, as shown in Fig. S9b–S9e.†

(g) Comparison of R and response time of various Ge-based heterojunction devices. 
Finally, the visible and infrared imaging of the InSe/Ge vdWH is further investigated by a single-pixel scanning imaging system. Fig. 6d shows the measurement setup for NIR and visible photocurrent mapping, where the photodetector is used as a separate sensing pixel and a hollow “YBG” pattern that automatically moves in the X–Y direction is placed between the photodetector and the 635 nm and 1550 nm single-mode lasers (50 mW cm−2). The moving distance of the mask is 2 μm per step. As the mask moves, the current signal is collected by a lock-in amplifier, producing a position-dependent photocurrent mapping image. As a result, a readable image with uniform photocurrent distribution can be clearly achieved as shown in Fig. 6e and f (a pattern of “YBG” with a high-resolution contrast (211 × 466 pixels) can be produced at room temperature under 1550 nm and 635 nm irradiation). This result confirms the great potential of InSe/Ge photodetectors for room-temperature visible and infrared imaging. In order to compare the performance of our photodiode among the reported Ge-based photodetectors, a comparison of R and response time is given in Fig. 6g. The R of our photodiode is much larger than the maximum R of other Ge-based photodetectors. Table S1† gives a more detailed comparison of the photocurrent anisotropic ratio, R and response time, etc.25,54,55,61,67,68 From the table, it can be seen that our fabricated InSe/Ge device not only shows a high R, but also a high polarization sensitivity with the ratio of maximum photocurrent to the minimum photocurrent of 3.01 under a 635 nm laser. It reveals that our device has great advantages in high-performance photoresponse and polarization-sensitive photodetection.
3. Conclusion
In summary, we have successfully constructed a visible and near-infrared p-Ge/n-InSe mixed-dimensional vdWH photodiode with a type-II energy band alignment. It possesses a broad spectral response from 400 nm to 1600 nm. The prepared photodiodes exhibit high photoresponse in the self-powered mode at 405 nm/1550 nm, including a high R of 0.88/9.78 A W−1 and a high D* of up to 4.88 × 1010/5.38 × 1011 Jones. The room temperature R and D* of the devices in the photovoltaic mode are 0.203 A W−1 and 5.6 × 108 Jones, respectively, under the illumination of a blackbody source at 1000 K, showing great potential for practical applications. A fast response speed of 46/32 μs at the frequency of 111 Hz with a 3 dB of 13 kHz at zero bias under 1550 nm illumination is also achieved. Moreover, a maximum polarization sensitivity of 3.01 can be achieved under 635 nm illumination. The high-resolution imaging capability of the device in the visible and near-infrared regions is further demonstrated by a single-point imaging system. Our work provides a new strategy for a next-generation high-performance, wide-band polarization-sensitive photodetector based on InSe/Ge vdWH.
4. Methods
4.1 Device fabrication
Multilayer γ-InSe on 300 nm SiO2/Si substrates are obtained from the bulk single crystal (bulk single crystals from 2D semiconductor Co., Ltd, which is purchased from Shanghai OnWay Technology Co., Ltd) by mechanical exfoliation (3M Scotch tape). γ-InSe can be detected by optical microscopy (BA310MET-T, Motic) in a moderate thickness of 1–200 nm on SiO2/Si.
Two-inch p-type moderately doped (100) Ge wafers (8–8.2 Ω cm and the thickness is about 350 μm) were cleaned with acetone, ethanol, and deionized water, dried, and then vaporized with 300 nm SiO2 on Ge by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Then they were cut into appropriate sizes and cleaned successively with ethanol, acetone, and deionized water. The as-prepared Ge substrate was spin coated with a positive photoresist (AR-P 5350 bought from Taizhou SUNANO New Energy Co., Ltd) at 3600 rpm for 50 s and baked at 100 °C for 4 min.
A maskless photolithography machine (TuoTuo Technology (Suzhou) Co., Ltd) with an exposure wavelength of 405 nm was used to create a 300 × 30 square window, which was developed with a tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide solution (MACKLIN Co., Ltd, Shanghai), cleaned with deionized water, and dried with nitrogen gas. A buffered oxide etch solution (BOE, HF:NH4F:H2O = 9 mL:20 g:30 mL) is used to etch the SiO2 layer in the existing window to expose the surface of Ge. The etched Ge sheet is then spin-coated with a photoresistor using the already drawn pattern and then developed with tetramethyl sulfoxide and deionized water. Then Cr/Au metal (10 nm/50 nm) is deposited on the whole chip by electron beam evaporation, followed by immersion in acetone and deionized water. The mechanically exfoliated multilayer γ-InSe was transferred to the Ge window and SiO2 surface by a dry transfer method using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/PDMS through a three-axis manipulator platform (Shanghai Onway Technology Co., Ltd) (the details can be found in ESI S2†). The Ge/γ-InSe heterojunction was annealed at 150 °C for 10 min in a vacuum environment to improve the contact quality.
4.2 Characterization and measurement
Optical microscopy (ECLIPSE LV150N, Nikon) was used to observe the size and heterojunction morphology of γ-InSe. γ-InSe/Ge heterojunctions and the Raman spectra of single materials were measured at room temperature by a Raman spectrometer (Nost Technology Co., Ltd) equipped with a 532 nm laser excitation. The PL spectra were recorded with the Micro Confocal Raman Spectrometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon Co., Ltd). The thicknesses of the samples were characterized by an AFM (Dimension Fast Scan from Bruker Co., Ltd). The potential difference between γ-InSe and Ge was tested by KPFM (Dimension Fast Scan from Bruker Co., Ltd). The electrical properties were measured with a three-probe station equipped with a Keithley 2636B SourceMeter. The photoresponse behavior under visible and infrared light was studied with the help of a fiber-coupled laser system, including 405 nm, 635 nm, 808 nm, 1310 nm and 1550 nm circular lasers. The optical power density was calculated using an optical power meter/energy meter (THORLABS, Co., Ltd). The spectral response of the heterojunctions ranging from 400 to 1600 was studied by a variable-wavelength photocurrent instrument (MStarter ABS DUV-NIR Microscopic Absorption Spectroscopy System, Nanjing Metatest Optoelectronics Co., Ltd) under a tungsten light source with a power of 4.5 mW cm−2. Finally, at a fixed power laser of 1550 nm, the optical response was studied at different frequencies. A polarizer was added between the incident laser and the device, and we used a fiber-coupled laser system with 635 nm, 808 nm and 1550 nm circularly polarized light to explore the polarization-sensitive properties of the device. Single-point imaging was done by a photocurrent imaging instrument (Mstarter 200 High Precision Photocurrent Scanning Test Microscope) at fixed powers of 605 and 1550 nm, respectively. Blackbody measurements are performed at room temperature using a standard commercial blackbody furnace (HFY-200C). The device was placed at a distance of 15 cm from the aperture. The total incident power at the device surface can be calculated using the approximate equation , where α, ε and δ are the modulation factor, the average emissivity of the blackbody source and the Stefan–Boltzmann constant, respectively. For our blackbody source, ε is 0.99. Th and T0 are the temperatures of the blackbody radiation source and the room temperature (300 K), respectively. The units of S are square centimeters. R and L are the temperature of the blackbody radiation source and the radius of the blackbody radiation source aperture and the distance between the samples in centimeters. During the measurement, the device is placed at a distance of 15 cm from the aperture radius and an optical chopper is used to chop a fixed modulation frequency of 123 Hz.
