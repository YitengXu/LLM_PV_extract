    , Accepted 8th September 2019First published on 10th September 2019AbstractEmploying upconversion hosts (which convert lower-energy light into higher-energy light) and plasmonic Au nanoparticles, this work deals with the synthesis of a novel Au/NaYF4:Yb,Er/WO3·0.33H2O-W18O49 {denoted as A/NYYE/WW} heterojunction via a hydrothermal method followed by a photo-reduction method. Also, A/NYYE/WW exhibited the optimum photocatalytic activity and stronger photocatalytic stability for the degradation of nitrobenzene aqueous solution in comparison with a single WO3·0.33H2O or NYYE/WW component. Based on the results of X-ray diffraction patterns, field emission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectra, UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra, upconversion luminescence spectra, luminescence decay and photoelectrochemical measurements, it could be considered that a Z-scheme heterojunction was generated over A/NYYE/WW, in which a highly efficient Förster resonant energy transfer from NYYE to WO3·0.33H2O-W18O49 was observed and the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effects of Au NPs and W18O49 could induce the utilization of near infrared light to achieve broadband light absorption. On the other hand, Au NPs also played the role of an electron sink for enhanced charge carrier separation and utilization. Thus, the heterojunction showed the synergetic effects of both upconversion and LSPR features, which could broaden the absorption spectrum to the near infrared region and give rise to a higher yield. It provides a pathway to develop broadband absorption materials in photocatalytic systems.
1. Introduction
Nitrobenzene (NB) as an important chemical raw material is widely used in the manufacture of explosives, pesticides, and dyes and in other fields.1,2 The maximum permissible concentration of NB in wastewater is not more than 1 mg L−1.3 However, with the increasing demand for nitrobenzene, large amounts of wastewater containing nitrobenzene or its derivatives pose a serious threat to the environment and human beings. Therefore, a variety of possible treatment processes have been adopted to remove NB from industrial effluents, including adsorption,4 ozonation,5 photocatalytic degradation,6 and so on. Among these proposed methods, as one of the promising ways, semiconductor photocatalytic technology has been extensively studied for solving the problem of environmental pollution and alleviating the energy crisis.7–9 However, most semiconductors only absorb ultraviolet or visible light from sunlight, and nearly 50% of near infrared light (NIR) has not been exploited. So, it is still a challenging mission to exploit photocatalysts that can harvest NIR light.
In order to harness utmostly a wide range of sunlight energy, many methods have been used to modify semiconductors, such as loading noble metals,10 doping nonmetal elements,11 combining with other narrower bandgap semiconductors12,13 and constructing Z-scheme photocatalysts.14,15 However, the NIR light of the total solar spectrum is still rarely utilized. In order to extend the absorption to the NIR region, combining semiconductors with upconversion (UC) luminescent materials is one of the most efficient ways.16 UC materials can convert the light of low energy into that of higher energy,17,18 and have been used in bioimaging,19 dye-sensitized solar cells20 and photocatalytic systems.21,22 In particular, NaYF4 (NYF), as a kind of host lattice with lower phonon energy, can achieve efficient down-conversion or upconversion luminescence of doping lanthanide ions.23
Recently, the loading of plasmonic Au nanoparticles (NPs) and semiconductors with oxygen vacancies has been studied as a new research frontier for improving the photocatalytic activity using the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) under visible infrared light excitation due to enhanced photon absorption and utilization by means of plasmonic “hot electron” injection.24,25 Here, the LSPR effect in the W18O49 nanostructure, which is a type of nonstoichiometric tungsten oxide, originates from the collective oscillations of excessive free carriers due to abundant oxygen vacancies on its surface.26 W18O49 possesses a very broad absorption band ranging from the visible to IR region.27 Furthermore, the photoluminescence of UC NPs can be improved by the LSPR effect.28,29 The higher energy level in NaYF4:Yb,Er (NYYE) can emit visible light, which in turn excites the Au NPs and tungsten oxide semiconductors via the Förster resonant energy transfer (FRET).30 The plasmonic coupling between Au NPs and W18O49 possibly promotes the generation of plasmonic “hot-electrons”.31 On the other hand, during the plasmonic energy-transfer process, the photo-generated electrons would transfer from the semiconductors to the surfaces of Au NPs, facilitating efficient charge separation in the heterostructure.
In this work, we designed a unique visible-near infrared (Vis-NIR) light driven photocatalyst of a Au/NaYF4:Yb,Er/WO3·0.33H2O-W18O49 (A/NYYE/WW) heterostructure with UC and LSPR functions, which was applied in the broadband light absorption range and it showed more exceptional photocatalytic performance compared to bare WO3·0.33H2O and NYYE/WO3·0.33H2O-W18O49 (NYYE/WW) for the degradation of NB aqueous solution. It is notable that the degradation rate of the heterostructure was 2.7 and 2.5 times those of WO3·0.33H2O and NYYE/WW, respectively, when they were focused on a xenon lamp (λ > 420 nm) to initiate plasmonic and IR-excited catalysis.
2. Experimental
All the chemicals used in the experiments were of analytical reagent grade and used without further purification.
2.1 Synthesis of NaYF4:Yb,Er
NaYF4:25% Yb,2% Er nanocrystals were prepared by a hydrothermal method. Firstly, 5.22 mmol Y(NO3)3·6H2O, 1.57 mmol Yb(NO3)3·6H2O and 0.10 mmol Er(NO3)3·5H2O were mixed in 20 mL of deionized water. Then 30 mL of 0.23 M EDTA-2Na water solution was added dropwise to the above solution. Also, 30 mL of 1.22 M NH4F solution was added dropwise to the above mixed solution, and the pH of the whole solution was adjusted to 3 with nitric acid. After vigorous stirring for 1 h at room temperature, the whole mixed solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 12 h. The obtained sample was washed three times with deionized water and ethanol and vacuum dried at 60 °C for 10 h. NaYF4:25% Yb,2% Er was denoted as NYYE.
2.2 Synthesis of NaYF4:Yb,Er/WO3·0.33H2O-W18O49
A typical preparation process of NaYF4:Yb,Er/WO3·0.33H2O-W18O49 was as follows: 4.30 mmol Na2WO4·2H2O was dissolved in 60 mL of deionized water under vigorous stirring for 30 min at room temperature. 0.67 g of the as-prepared NYYE was added to the above solution under stirring, and the pH of the whole solution was adjusted to 1.0 with nitric acid. After stirring for another 1 h, the solution was subsequently transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and maintained at 180 °C for 12 h. Bare WO3·0.33H2O was prepared by the same method without the addition of NYYE. The obtained sample was washed several times with deionized water and ethanol, and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 10 h, and was denoted as NYYE/WW.
2.3 Preparation of Au/NaYF4:Yb,Er/WO3·0.33H2O-W18O49
The Au-loaded NaYF4:Yb,Er/WO3·0.33H2O-W18O49 sample (denoted as A/NYYE/WW) was prepared by a photo-reduction method, taking HAuCl4·4H2O as the Au precursor. In a typical process, 1.0 g of as-synthesized NYYE/WW was thoroughly dispersed in 50 mL deionized water for 30 min under vigorous stirring. Then, 5.275 mL of HAuCl4·4H2O solution (9.7 mM) was added into the above dispersion, especially, taking 20 mL of methanol as the sacrificial agent. The whole reaction was carried out under 300 W UV lamp irradiation for 3 h under stirring conditions. The obtained sample (about 1% mass ratio loading) was washed several times with deionized water and ethanol and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 10 h. Fig. 1 shows a diagram of the preparation process of A/NYYE/WW.

2.4 Photocatalytic studies
To determine the photocatalytic activities of the as-prepared samples, nitrobenzene was used as a simulated pollutant. Degradation of nitrobenzene aqueous solution was carried out in a quartz reactor. 30 mg of the desired catalyst was dispersed in 50 mL of 20 ppm nitrobenzene solution, using a 300 W xenon lamp (λ ≥ 420 nm) as the initiated light source. Prior to irradiation, the suspension consisting of catalysts and nitrobenzene was stirred in the dark for 40 min to reach adsorption–desorption equilibrium. During the photocatalytic reaction, 3–4 mL of the suspension was extracted and centrifuged at a certain interval. The supernatant was analysed using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-6300 double beam spectrophotometer). The efficiencies of degradations (η) can be calculated from the following equation: η = (1 − Ct/C0) × 100%, where C0 and Ct represent the initial concentration and temporal concentration, respectively.
2.5 Characterization
A Bruker D8 Advance powder X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) was used to characterize the crystal structures of the as-prepared samples. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (QUANTA F250) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) (JEM-2100F) were performed to investigate the morphologies and surface composition structures of the obtained samples. The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were obtained using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer (UV-2600, Shimadzu) by taking BaSO4 as the reflectance standard. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 5700 FT-IR spectrometer. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded using an ESCALab250Xi (Thermo Scientific, American) to obtain the elemental compositions and valence states of the samples. The up-conversion PL spectra were recorded using an Edinburgh Instruments Model FLS980 spectrometer equipped with a commercial 980 nm NIR laser as the excitation source. Photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out on a CHI660E workstation using a 0.2 M Na2SO4 electrolyte, with the photocatalytic materials coating on FTO as the working electrode and a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode and platinum electrode as the reference electrode and the counter electrode, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
The structural compositions of the as-synthesized samples were examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. From Fig. 2, it can be clearly observed that there are no impurity peaks identified for bare β-NaYF4 (JCPDS No. 16-0334)32 and orthorhombic WO3·0.33H2O (JCPDS No. 87-1203)33 samples, and meanwhile by hydrothermal treatment at 180 °C for 12 h, the NYYE/WO3·0.33H2O composite with mixed phases exhibits not only the characteristic diffraction peaks of pure β-NaYF4 and WO3·0.33H2O, but also two other characteristic diffraction peaks at 25.9° and 27.6°, which could be attributed to oxygen-deficient monoclinic W18O49 (JCPDS 05-0392).34 This indicates that W18O49 was introduced into the composite probably due to the interaction between NYYE and WO3·0.33H2O. This interaction resulting in the generation of oxygen vacancies can be attributed to the replacement of lattice oxygen in WO3·0.33H2O by F− in NYYE owing to their similar ionic radii (F−: 136 pm vs. O2−: 140 pm).35–37 Note that the lack of the characteristic peaks of Au NPs can be ascribed to their low amount or high dispersion in the heterostructure.

The morphology and microstructure of the A/NYYE/WW heterostructure were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). WO3·0.33H2O consists of plentiful nanorods with a diameter of about 100 nm (Fig. 3a) and NYYE has a 8 μm height of uniform hexagonal prisms (Fig. 3b). It can be seen that with an integration of WO3·0.33H2O and NYYE, the aggregation and the sizes of the WO3·0.33H2O nanorods begin to decrease (Fig. S1a†), and there exist a large number of micron-sized NYYE NPs (TEM, Fig. 3e and Fig. S1c†) compared with bare WO3·0.33H2O (Fig. 3d and Fig. S1b†), which demonstrates that the formation of the heterojunction has a great influence on the surface–interface and microstructure of the product. So the abundant active points may play an important role in photocatalysis. Meanwhile, FT-IR spectra (Fig. S2†) demonstrate their interaction by the change of the W–O stretching vibration and show an enhanced surface hydroxyl group. After the loading of Au NPs, the morphology of A/NYYE/WW (Fig. 3c) does not seem to show any obvious change compared with that of NYYE/WW (Fig. S1a†), and the average size of the Au NPs is estimated to be about 8 nm as shown in Fig. 3e and Fig. S1c.† In addition, well-defined crystal lattices of A/NYYE/WW are also shown in the HRTEM image of Fig. 3e. The marked lattice distances are 0.630 nm, 0.483 nm and 0.328 nm, corresponding to the (020), (111) and (022) faces of WO3·0.33H2O, respectively. The lattice fringe spacing of 0.291 nm fits well with the NYF. Additionally, the lattice spacings of 0.23 nm and 0.435 nm are related to Au (111) planes and W48O19 (−303) planes, respectively. The elemental mapping image of A/NYYE/WW is shown in Fig. 3f. It is revealed that Au, W, O, Na, F, Y, Yb and Er are uniformly distributed throughout the sample, which further confirms the chemical composition of the prepared A/NYYE/WW.

XPS spectra were recorded to study the chemical states of the surface elements on A/NYYE/WW, as shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. S3.† The typical survey spectrum in Fig. S3a† shows the presence of Na, F, Y, Yb, Er, Au, O and W elements. The characteristic peaks at 1070.2 eV and 686.1 eV (Fig. S3b and d†) are attributed to Na 1s and F 1s, respectively.38 Er 4d and Yb 4d peaks (Fig. S3c†) are observed at 172.8 eV and 185.4 eV, respectively, confirming the doping in NaYF4.39 As shown in Fig. S3e,† the peaks at 159.36 eV and 161.35 eV match with Y 3d5/2 and Y 3d3/2, respectively.37 The binding energies (BEs) located at 35.3 eV and 37.4 eV (Fig. 4a) are assigned to W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2 bands, respectively, suggesting the presence of W6+. The other two peaks observed at 36.9 and 34.8 eV correspond to W5+.40 The two Gaussian function peaks of O 1s (Fig. S3f†) are related to lattice oxygen with a BE of 530.1 eV and the surface hydroxyl group or adsorption of water molecules on the surface with a BE of 532.4 eV, respectively.41 In addition, the BEs at 83.3 eV and 86.9 eV (Fig. 4b) are assigned to Au 4f7/2 and Au 4f5/2, which are similar to Au0 4f7/2 (84.0 eV), suggesting the metallic state of the Au species. Furthermore, the negative shift of Au0 4f7/2 (about 0.7 eV) indicates strong interactions and electron transfer between Au and NYYE/WW.42

Fig. 5a shows the UV–Vis DRS of the obtained samples. They exhibit a slight red shift after the loading of NYYE, which may be attributed to the presence of oxygen-deficient monoclinic W18O49. In addition, three new absorption bands apparently appear at 486 nm, 520 nm and 651 nm due to the 4f transitions from the 4I15/2 ground state to the 4F7/2, 2H11/2, and 4F9/2 states of Er3+, respectively.43 The transitions of the 4f electrons of Er3+ may facilitate the transfer of the photoinduced carriers, thus enhancing the photocatalytic activity. Also, a characteristic band at 530 nm over the A/NYYE/WW heterostructure with a narrower band gap can be clearly observed, mainly owing to the LSPR effect of Au NPs.44

In order to prove whether these emissions are capable of exciting the WO3·0.33H2O and Au NPs, the UC luminescence spectra were measured under the excitation of a 980 nm laser as shown in Fig. 5b. The green emissions between 513–534 nm and 534–561 nm are assigned to the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transitions, respectively. There is a significant red emission from 641 to 680 nm, on account of the transition from 4F9/2 to 4I15/2.45 In addition, there may be more energy transfer occurring between the sensitizer and activator, due to the increased excited Yb3+ probably by the local field enhancement of Au NPs.46 Furthermore, after the loading of Au NPs, the intensities of green-to-red emissions are increased due to the LSPR excitation of the Au NPs.44 Therefore, the subtly designed A/NYYE/WW can utilize the NIR photons by upconverting them into visible light by UC emission and the LSPR effect.
The fluorescence lifetimes of NYYE and A/NYYE/WW samples were measured at 520 and 543 nm {Fig. 5(c and d)}, respectively, to demonstrate the energy transfer from the excited state levels of Er3+ to Au NPs and WO3(0.33)-W18O49. The average decay lifetimes of 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 were calculated to be 440.2 μs vs. 137.7 μs (at 520 nm NYYE vs. A/NYYE/WW) and 434.9 μs vs. 138.2 μs (at 543 nm, NYYE vs. A/NYYE/WW), respectively. These accelerated decay lifetimes of A/NYYE/WW are attributed to the presence of highly efficient FRET.47 There exists an energy transfer channel between FRET donors and acceptors.48 Based on the 1931 CIE chromaticity diagram (Fig. 5e), it can be seen that the UC spectra of all the samples belong to the green region centered at 540 nm, which is consistent with the Fig. 5b results. In addition, the heterojunction may utilize green light for photocatalytic reactions, which probably enhances the utilization efficiency of sunlight and its photocatalytic performance.
Photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out to investigate the transfer efficiencies of the photo-induced carriers under 300 W Xe lamp irradiation with 420 nm cutoff tablets. An enhanced photocurrent (Fig. 6a) and a smaller arc radius (Fig. 6b) in the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist plots of A/NYYE/WW compared with those of bare NYYE and WO3·0.33H2O can be clearly observed, indicating that the loading of NYYE and Au NPs over WO3·0.33H2O-W18O49 can improve the surface charge transfer and separation efficiency of the photo-generated charge carriers.49 In addition, as shown in Fig. 6c, the lifetime of electrons can be estimated using the equation τ = 1/(2πfmin), where fmin represents the minimum inverse frequency.50 The calculated values are listed in detail in Table 1. A lower frequency implies a longer carrier lifetime.51 It can be clearly seen that the carrier lifetime of A/NYYE/WW is longer than those of the other samples. The increased lifetime demonstrates the enhanced charge separation and migration of A/NYYE/WW, which may favor the improvement of the photocatalytic performance.

The photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. 6d) were measured with an excitation wavelength of 250 nm to demonstrate the possibility of the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs over the as-synthesized samples.52 A lower intensity indicates a higher separation efficiency. It can be clearly seen that compared with that of other samples, the intensity of A/NYYE/WW is dramatically decreased, which implies that A/NYYE/WW shows more efficient carrier separation efficiency. Thus, this result is consistent with the above photoelectrochemical measurements.
To observe the photocatalytic activities of the as-synthesized samples, experiments on the degradation of 20 ppm NB solution under Vis-NIR light expanding to 1100 nm (λ ≥ 420 nm) with a power density of about 1.2 W cm−2, under visible light and under NIR irradiation were carried out as shown in Fig. S4† and Fig. 7(a, c and e). Firstly, the photocatalytic activities of the NYYE/WW composites with different mass ratios (NYYE for 20, 30, 40 and 50 wt%) and A/NYYE/WW with different mass fractions of Au NP loading were evaluated (the preparation process is described in the ESI†). As shown in Fig. S4a,† when the different contents of NYYE are combined, the NYYE/WW composites exhibit evidently enhanced activities compared with WO3·0.33H2O. NYYE/WW with the optimal mass ratio of 40% shows the best activity, as shown in Fig. 7. Based on this heterojunction, the performances with different loading amounts of Au NPs were further studied. Fig. S4b† shows that the optimum loading of Au NPs is 1%. Thus, for the whole heterojunction system, the sample with the best catalytic activity is 1% Au/NYYE (40)/WW, that is, A/NYYE/WW shown in Fig. 7. In Fig. 7, it can be clearly observed that NYYE/WW exhibits slightly higher photocatalytic activity (with a degradation rate of 41%) than the bare WO3·0.33H2O (with a removal efficiency of 35%) owing to the presence of NYYE. In particular, the photocatalytic performance of the A/NYYE/WW heterostructure shows a degradation rate of 96%. The calculated reaction rate of the photocatalytic degradation of A/NYYE/WW is about 2.7 times higher than that of WO3·0.33H2O (Fig. 7b).

In addition, to demonstrate the respective contribution of visible and NIR light, the photocatalytic degradation of the 20 ppm NB solution was measured under visible, NIR and Vis-NIR light irradiation, respectively. As shown in Fig. 7(a, c and e), with the different light sources, it can be found that A/NYYE/WW exhibits a higher photocatalytic efficiency than other samples. The calculated reaction rates {Fig. 7(b, d and f)} of the A/NYYE/WW sample are about 3.35 and 4.64 times higher than that of WO3·0.33H2O, corresponding to visible and NIR light, respectively. Also, as observed from Fig. S4c,† the A/NYYE/WW heterojunction shows a higher catalytic performance than Au/W18O49 and Au/WO3·0.33H2O under Vis-NIR light irradiation. Fig. S4d† also shows the photocatalytic control experiments of illuminating the Au loaded on WO3·0.33H2O or W18O49 under NIR light irradiation, which confirms that the UC luminescence of NYYE induced the effect of the highly efficient Förster resonant energy transfer. Meanwhile, Au/WO3·0.33H2O and Au/W18O49 with the corresponding removal efficiencies of about 5% and 15% are mainly assigned to the NIR region absorptions of Au NPs and W18O49, in agreement with a previous report.31,53 So the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation may be mainly attributable to the LSPR effect of Au NPs and W18O49. This synergy originates from the UC function and LSPR effect to jointly promote the broad absorption from the visible to NIR region, which can also be seen from the DRS images. In particular, the enhancement under NIR light irradiation should be attributed to the synergetic effects of the dominating UC property of NYYE and sectional LSPR effects of Au NPs and W18O49. Thus, this result proves that the A/NYYE/WW catalyst can efficiently utilize Vis-NIR light in the solar spectrum.
Moreover, the cycling performance of A/NYYE/WW was investigated as shown in Fig. 8a, showing better stability with a slight decrease of about 8% on account of the mechanical loss in the centrifugation process. To further explore the real active species of the reaction process, capture experiments were carried out for the degradation of NB (Fig. 8b), using p-benzoquinone (p-BZQ), EDTA-2Na and tert butyl alcohol (TBA) as the radical scavengers of ˙O2−, h+ and ˙OH, respectively.54 As observed from Fig. 8b, the degradation efficiency is dramatically decreased to 32%, 65% and 46%, respectively, which demonstrates that ˙O2− active species are the key active species in the present photocatalytic reaction, following the order ˙O2− > ˙OH > h+.

To further investigate whether the electrons were transferred from the conductive band (CB) of W18O49 to Au rather than from the CB of WO3·0.33H2O to Au, the flat band (Efb) potential was measured using Mott–Schottky plots at a frequency of 1000 Hz in the dark. In general, for the n-type semiconductor, the flat-band potential is located near the CB. As shown in Fig. 9a, a positive slope on the potential axis indicates the n-type characteristic state of the designed photocatalysts.55 The values of Efb were calculated to be −0.28 V and −0.27 V (vs. NHE) without an obvious positive shift, corresponding to WO3·0.33H2O and A/NYYE/WW, respectively. This indicates that the number of electrons in the CB of WO3·0.33H2O has not changed, and it even shows charge accumulation. So, the only way to transfer electrons is from the CB of W18O49 to Au NPs, resulting in the generation of a Z-scheme heterojunction over A/NYYE/WW.
 Fig. 9  (a) Mott–Schottky plots of WO3·0.33H2O and A/NYYE/WW and (b) the proposed photocatalytic mechanism of the A/NYYE/WW photocatalyst under Vis-NIR light irradiation. 
Based on the above analysis, the proposed possible photocatalytic mechanism of A/NYYE/WW can be summarized into three main processes, as shown in Fig. 9b: (a) NYYE can absorb NIR light, where the Yb3+ ions act as the sensitizer and the Er3+ ions act as the activator. The excited state (2F5/2 level) of Yb3+ is formed from the ground state (2F7/2 level) via excitation under NIR light irradiation. Subsequently, the successive energy transfer from the excited Yb3+ ions to the Er3+ ions occurs to populate the corresponding 2H11/2, 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 levels of Er3+ ions in the exited state.56 (b) On the other hand, the green emissions centered at 521 and 538 nm match well with the SPR band of Au NPs and W18O49. The energy from the Er3+ ions in the higher energy levels possibly transfers directly to NYYE and W18O49 through the FRET process, which in turn induces the occurrence of the LSPR effect.30 Au NPs act as an electron reservoir and LSPR-sensitizer, which favor the electron transfer from the VB of WO3·0.33H2O-W18O49 to the surfaces of Au NPs. (c) According to the DRS and UC luminescence spectra, the generated green emission and red emission of the Er3+ ions can be reabsorbed by the adjacent WO3·0.33H2O and W18O49, and then the excited semiconductor can produce the charge carriers in favor of the photocatalytic degradation of NB. The transferred electrons can react with O2 to produce ˙O2− radicals, and the remaining holes in the valence band of W18O49 can react with OH−/H2O to generate ˙OH radicals. The NB in aqueous solution is mineralized by these active radicals, described by a Z-scheme mechanism. In this way, the NIR light can be indirectly utilized by Au NPs and WO3·0.33H2O-W18O49via the energy transfer process followed by the energetic electron transfer process.
4. Conclusions
In summary, both the UC function and LSPR effect of Au NPs and W18O49 were applied to modify semiconductors to largely achieve broadband light absorption and enhanced photocatalytic activity. The effective energy transfer through the UC process can convert NIR light into shorter wavelength light. On the other hand, Au NPs also play the role of an electron sink to effectively promote the separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes. Thus, the synergistic effects of the factors result in a higher yield of photocarriers. The newly designed A/NYYE/WW photocatalyst showed superior photocatalytic performance and excellent stability for the degradation of NB aqueous solution under Vis-NIR light irradiation. The established A/NYYE/WW photocatalytic heterostructure system as a promising material paves the way for greatly improving the efficiency of solar-energy utilization, indicating its further applications in the removal of photocatalytic environmental pollutants.
