    , Accepted 3rd January 2018First published on 3rd January 2018AbstractA new family of naphthalenediimide (NDI)-bithiophene-based random terpolymers (PNDI-Fu10, PNDI-Th10, and PNDI-Se10) was prepared by incorporating a small amount (10 mol%) of different chalcogenophene units, namely furan (Fu), thiophene (Th), and selenophene (Se), into a poly((N,N’-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl)-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)) (P(NDI2OD-T2)) backbone. The terpolymers all exhibited negligible optical property and frontier energy level differences. Interestingly, the blend film morphology and photovoltaic performance of all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), comprising a random terpolymer series as an acceptor and poly(6-fluoro-2,3-bis-(3-octyloxyphenyl)quinoxaline-5,8-dyl-alt-thiophene-2,5-diyl) (FTQ) as a donor, were strongly dependent on the type of chalcogenophene. Consequently, the all-PSCs revealed a clear variation in short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) while retaining identical open-circuit voltages (VOC). The greatest power-conversion efficiency of 5.88% with a high JSC of 10.77 mA cm−2 was observed for PNDI-Th10:FTQ because of a synergistic contribution from a more preferential π-face-on orientation and suppression of bimolecular/geminate recombination. This was confirmed by a detailed investigation on the morphology and charge dynamic structural properties. In addition to understanding their effects on photovoltaic characteristics, this study demonstrates that introducing a small amount of the chalcogenophenes into a well-performing polymer is a simple and effective method to improve JSC values while maintaining VOCs of the parent polymers.
Introduction
Owing to the ease of fabrication, flexibility, and potential for cost-effective mass production, polymer/fullerene-based polymer solar cells (PSCs) have represented a promising technology for next-generation solar energy conversion for several years.1–11 Extensive research into the development of low-bandgap donor polymers and device fabrication techniques has yielded significant breakthroughs in PSC power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) by up to 9%–11%.12–19 Despite the essential role of fullerenes in high-performance PSCs, they have several drawbacks such as poor light absorption and high production costs.20
Driven by the attractive features of (i) the potential to tune molecular energy levels and bandgaps of acceptors, (ii) light harvesting and exciton generation by both donors and acceptors, and (iii) the improvement of device stability by replacing optically unstable fullerenes, all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) comprising polymers as both donors and acceptors have emerged as an alternative to fullerene-based PSCs and have recently attracted increased interest.21–24 However, high-performance all-PSCs have been less successful than fullerene-based systems owing to their poor charge carrier generation and/or collection efficiencies induced by their undesirable morphology, such as large-scale phase-separated domain size, inhomogeneous internal phase composition, and reduced ordering of polymer chains.25 Therefore, some researchers have attempted to control the nanoscale structure of phase separation in all-PSCs with various strategies (e.g., thermal annealing, solvent vapor annealing, self-assembly of polymer nanowires, and use of processing additives) successfully used in fullerene-based systems.26–35 Unfortunately, self-organization kinetics and morphologies of all macromolecular constituents are very different compared to those of their corresponding fullerene-based blends because of the differences in the molecular geometries of fullerene and n-type polymer acceptors, and only a few all-PSCs are reported to have high PCEs in this regard.36–45 Therefore, achieving the desired morphology for polymer/polymer blends without sacrificing other properties is of major importance for all-PSCs.
Random copolymerization is a facile and promising synthetic strategy for fine-tuning the intrinsic properties of parent-alternating donor–acceptor copolymers. For example, we recently reported that the morphology (e.g., crystallinity and orientation) of random donor terpolymers could be correctly modulated to achieve high photovoltaic characteristics while maintaining similar photophysical and electrochemical properties of the parent polymers.46,47
In addition, Wang et al. and Jenekhe et al. demonstrated that the fine-tuned crystallinity of naphthalenediimide (NDI)-based random acceptor terpolymers enabled high PCEs of all-PSCs.39,41,48,49
Currently, there are no analogous or other studies on the role of chalcogenophene variation in random terpolymers in optical and physical properties, morphologies and performances of all-PSCs. The current study (i) describes the synthesis of a series of naphthalenediimide-bithiophene (NDI-T2)-based random acceptor terpolymers with different chalcogenophene comonomers, furan (Fu), thiophene (Th), and selenophene (Se) and (ii) presents a systematic study of their optical, electronic, and electrical properties and the characteristics of all-PSCs based on the resulting terpolymers. Based on previously reported PSC results of Wang et al. and Jenekhe et al., 10 mol% of each chalcogenophene relative to the total donor units was chosen as the optimal composition in the NDI polymer backbone. From these investigations, a structure–property–performance relationship was established, and this provides materials design criteria for new conjugated random terpolymers for all-PSCs.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
As shown in Scheme 1, the random terpolymers were prepared by palladium-catalyzed Stille coupling polymerization of three monomers, and the polymers of 2,6-dibromonaphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic-N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)diimide, 5,5′-bis(trimethyl-stannyl)-2,2′-bithiophene, 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene, 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)furan, and 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)-selenophene were synthesized according to previously published procedures.50–52 The resulting terpolymers were denoted as PNDI-Fu10, PNDI-Th10, and PNDI-Se10 (10 indicates 10 mol% of the chalcogenophene components (Fu, Th, and Se) in the feed). The detailed polymerization procedures are described in the Experimental section.

The chemical structures and high purity of the polymers were confirmed using 1H-NMR and elementary analysis. 1H-NMR measurements of the terpolymers were recorded in deuterated 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane at a high temperature (70 °C). As shown in Fig. 1, there were two distinct aromatic peaks: peaks at δ = 8.88–9.23 ppm were assigned to the aromatic protons of NDI units and peaks at δ = 7.72–7.41 ppm were associated with the heteroacenes’ protons (T2, Fu, Th, and Se moieties). The integral ratios between T2 and the chalcogenophene peaks for all random terpolymers were consistent with their feed ratios. The detailed calculation and the calculated values are provided in the ESI, Fig. S1† and Table S1.† In addition, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed to determine thermal transitions. All the random terpolymers exhibited both a melting transition (Tm) upon heating and a crystallization transition (Tc) upon cooling (ESI, Fig. S2†). PNDI-Fu10 exhibited slightly higher thermal transitions for both Tm and Tc than PNDI-Th10 and PNDI-Se10 (Table 1).

High-temperature gel-permeation chromatography (HT-GPC) was used to determine the number-average molecular weight (Mn) and the polydispersity index (PDI) of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene at 120 °C relative to a polystyrene standard. As seen in Table 1, PNDI-Fu10, PNDI-Th10, and PNDI-Se10 showed Mns of 55.4, 85.9, and 61.7 kDa, respectively, with PDIs in the range of 2.12–2.29. We note that the observed variation in the Mns is most likely due to the different reactivities of the chalcogenophenes. The relatively high Mn of PNDI-Th10 can potentially provide additional benefits in crystallite formation, recombination loss, and photovoltaic performance when blended with a donor polymer in all-PSC applications,39 which will be discussed in the following sections.
All of the terpolymers with reasonably high Mns (over 55 kDa) were readily dissolved in common organic solvents such as dichlorobenzene, chlorobenzene, chloroform, and toluene at room temperature due to a combination of long-branched alkyl chains and structural irregularity of the polymer backbone from the introduction of the random copolymerization strategy. As all terpolymers had similar, high Mn values, the dependence of the photovoltaic performance on the molecular weight could be ruled out.
The optical properties of the terpolymers as solutions in chloroform and films were studied via UV–Vis spectroscopy under the same conditions (Fig. 2). The absorption spectra of the three terpolymers exhibited two absorption bands, as observed in many other donor–acceptor copolymers: one at 350–450 nm, the result of a π–π* transition, and another broad band at 450–800 nm because of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between an electron-deficient unit and an electron-donating unit. Thin films of the terpolymers exhibited slightly broader and red-shifted absorption relative to their corresponding solutions because of interchain stacking and aggregation of the polymer chains in the solid state. The three terpolymers demonstrated very similar optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of 1.48–1.50 eV estimated from their absorption edges in the thin films; PNDI-Fu10 and PNDI-Se10 exhibited a slightly higher ICT band intensity compared to PNDI-Th10.

Electrochemical redox behavior and electronic energy levels of the three terpolymers were analyzed via cyclic voltammetry (CV). Thin films of the terpolymers were deposited on a platinum working electrode, and measured in an acetonitrile solvent with ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as an internal standard and tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (n-Bu4NPF6, 0.1 M/acetonitrile) as a supporting electrolyte; Fc/Fc+ was assigned an absolute energy of −4.8 eV versus the vacuum level.53,54 As shown in Fig. 3, all the terpolymers displayed two reversible reduction waves without any oxidation peaks during the anodic scan. Based on the onset values of the first reduction potentials of the terpolymers, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels were determined according to the LUMO equation (eV = −4.8 − (Efirst1/2red − EFc/Fc+1/2ox)). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels were obtained from the equation HOMO (eV) = LUMO − Eoptg. All the terpolymers exhibited very similar LUMO (−5.29 to −5.30 eV) and HOMO (−3.79 to −3.82 eV) levels. Collectively, the UV–Vis and CV data suggest that the introduction of a small amount of the different chalcogenophene comonomers into the poly{[N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalenedicarboximide-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)} (P(NDI2OD-T2)) backbone does not lead to significant changes in the optical properties and the frontier energy levels.

The geometry-optimized structures were simulated using the density functional theory at B3LYP/6-31G* levels. The NDI-T2-NDI-Fu, NDI-T2-NDI-Th, and NDI-T2-NDI-Se units were taken as model oligomers in a sequential manner, and the methyl side chains were used to reduce the computational time. As shown in ESI, Fig. S3,† for all cases, the electron density distributions were very similar.
Note that the dihedral angles between NDI and chalcogenophene blocks were in the order NDI-T2-NDI-Fu < NDI-T2-NDI-Th < NDI-T2-NDI-Se, which is likely attributable to the size of the chalcogen atoms.
Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic properties of the (FTQ):NDI-based terpolymer blends were investigated by fabricating the all-PSCs with a conventional device configuration: indium–tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) active layer with perylene diimides functionalized with amino N-oxide (PDINO)/Al, where PDINO was used as a cathodic layer.55 FTQ was chosen as the donor polymer because it exhibited good compatibility with the parent polymer P(NDI2OD-T2), and it resulted in the high performance of all-PSCs in the authors’ previous work.40
The devices were tested under a 100 mW cm−2 air mass with 1.5 global (AM 1.5 G) solar illumination. The active layer, spin-coated from a chloroform solution with 1.0% diiodooctane (DIO) (v/v), was thermally annealed at 120 °C for 10 min. The detailed device fabrication conditions can be found in the Experimental section. All devices with donor/acceptor (D/A) weight ratios of 2.3:1 exhibited the best photovoltaic performance. The optimized film thickness of the active layers is ∼140–220 nm (Table 2). The Mn difference of the terpolymers is a likely cause of the different thicknesses. The current–density–voltage (J–V) curves of the best performing all-PSCs based on FTQ:PNDI-Fu10, FTQ:PNDI-Th10, and FTQ:PNDI-Se10 are presented in Fig. 4a, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters, including short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), and fill factor (FF), are shown in Table 2.

All the devices displayed nearly identical VOC values of 0.85–0.86 V consistent with the observed similarity of the frontier energy levels. Interestingly, we observed changes in JSC and FF values, depending upon the incorporation of 10 mol% of different chalcogenophene units in the polymer backbone. For example, the increasing trend in JSC values revealed the sequence PNDI-Th10 > PNDI-Se10 > PNDI-Fu10 and both PNDI-Th10 and PNDI-Se10 exhibited slightly higher FF values than that of PNDI-Fu10. A similar FF trend caused by the introduction of the heavier chalcogenophenes was also reported by Facchetti and Marks et al. recently.56 In addition, the different film thicknesses should be an additional contributor to the variation in the JSC and FF values since the film thickness also has a significant impact on the JSC and FF values.57 Consequently, a PNDI-Th10-based device exhibited the best PCE value of 5.88% with a VOC of 0.866 V, a JSC of 10.77 mA cm−2, and a FF of 63.53%, while PNDI-Se10- and PNDI-Fu10-based devices exhibited relatively low PCEs of 5.26% and 4.75%, respectively. Note that for a fair comparison, we also prepared a P(NDI2OD-T2) reference alternating copolymer and obtained the PCE of 5.36% in the optimized P(NDI2OD-T2)-based device (ESI, Fig. S4†).
External quantum efficiency (EQE) curves for the three devices are shown in Fig. 4b. All the EQE curves are similar in shape, and the integral current densities obtained from the EQE curves correlated well with the corresponding JSC value trends obtained from the J–V measurements. It is worth noting that despite a little weak absorption coefficient of the ICT band in a PNDI-Th10 neat film, the best-performing PNDI-Th10-based device has the highest EQE values throughout the spectral range, which is consistent with the absorption profiles observed in the blend films (ESI, Fig. S5†). This result suggests that the optimal blend morphology dominantly contributes to the photocurrent and conversion efficiency in the all-PSCs.
Morphological properties
Performances of PSCs are closely associated with the morphologies of their active layers; therefore, the morphologies of the optimized blend films were investigated by performing tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). The AFM images of all the blend films exhibited somewhat homogeneous flat surfaces with similar root-mean-square roughness in the range of 0.81–0.92 nm (Fig. 5), reflecting low crystallinity within the polymer domains, most likely because of the relatively low crystalline characteristics of the random terpolymers. However, the AFM features were less informative for resolving the morphological differences among blended polymers. To understand the reasons for why these three polymers had such different photovoltaic properties, the morphological properties of the three types of blend films were examined with grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) (Fig. 5, ESI Fig. S6,† and ESI Table S2†).
 Fig. 5  AFM height images (a) and 2D GIWAXS images (b) of the blend films. 
All the blend films exhibited strong (100) diffraction peaks at ∼0.23 Å−1 in both out-of-plane (qz) and in-plane (qxy) directions, corresponding to a lamellar d-spacing of ∼26 Å. Note that a Scherrer equation analysis of the (100) lamellar stacking peaks in the blend films yielded correlation length (CCL100) values of 117.8 Å (PNDI-Th10), 113.1 Å (PNDI-Se10), and 104.7 Å (PNDI-Fu10). In addition, a clear (010) diffraction peak was observed at 1.68 Å−1 for the PNDI-Th10-based blend film, which corresponds to the d-spacing for the π–π stacking of 3.72 Å, being evident for its higher proportion of face-on orientation. Note also that all the neat polymers also showed the (010) diffraction peaks in qz with only slightly different d-spacings (ESI, Fig. S7† and ESI, Table S3†). The CCL010 for the π-stacking (010) peak was not calculated due to the overlap of π-stacking peaks between donor and acceptor polymers. These increasing trends in CCL100 values and degree of face-on orientation coincide well with the device performances discussed above. It was concluded that the preferential π-face-on behavior with larger crystallites can contribute positively to charge transport in the vertical direction, ultimately enhancing JSCs of the random terpolymer-based PSCs in the order PNDI-Th10 > PNDI-Se10 > PNDI-Fu10.
Charge dissociation, recombination, and transport properties
Further studies dealing with basic operational mechanisms explored the carrier recombination in the devices by measuring the light intensity dependence of J–V characteristics under illumination of a solar simulator with a set of neutral densities. Fig. 6a and b represent the steady-state light intensity dependence of JSC and VOC for the PSCs based on the three terpolymers. The relationship between JSC and light intensity (I) can be described as JSC ∝ Iα. The scaling factor (α) in this equation approached unity when all the carriers were swept prior to bimolecular recombination.58–60 From the light intensity dependence of the JSC curves (Fig. 6a), α-values for the PNDI-Fu10, PNDI-Th10, and PNDI-Se10 optimal devices were found to be 0.94, 0.96, and 0.97, respectively. Additionally, the VOC increased monotonically with light intensity. The slope of VOCversus the natural logarithm of the light intensity gives kT/q, where k, T, and q are the Boltzmann constant, the temperature (in kelvin), and the elementary charge, respectively.61 As shown in Fig. 6b, the slope value increased slightly from 1.67 kT/q for PNDI-Th10 to 1.77 kT/q for PNDI-Fu10, and to 1.82 kT/q for PNDI-Se10. Collectively, the above data indicate that for all the present blends, both trap-assisted and bimolecular recombinations are operative, yet the trap-assisted recombination is the dominant loss mechanism.60 In addition, the carrier mobility of the three terpolymers and their corresponding blends was first measured using the space-charge-limited current method (Table 2 and Fig. 6c and d). From the hole mobility curve for the blends, 1.12 × 10−5, 1.07 × 10−5, and 2.25 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PNDI-Fu10, PNDI-Th10, and PNDI-Se10 were obtained, respectively and the electron mobility values for the blends were 6.35 × 10−5, 5.85 × 10−4, and 1.82 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. All mobility results are comparable to values reported in studies of high-efficiency all-PSCs.36,40,62 It is noteworthy that the PNDI-Th10 device had not only slightly higher hole and electron mobilities but also a more balanced mobility ratio than the other devices, which explains the enhancement of the JSC value.

Conclusions
To explore the effects of introducing three different chalcogenophene units, Fu, Th, and Se, into P(NDI2OD-T2) on photovoltaic characteristics, charge transport, and blend morphology in an all-PSC system, a new series of random acceptor terpolymers (PNDI-Fu10, PNDI-Th10, and PNDI-Se10) containing 10 mol% Fu, Th, or Se was synthesized and characterized. Incorporating a small amount of the chalcogenophenes into the polymer backbone was found to be effective for tuning morphology and microstructure in the blending active layer of the all-PSCs without influencing the optical properties and frontier energy levels of the polymers. As a result, all the devices demonstrated very similar high VOC ≈ 0.85–0.86 V, while clear changes in JSC and FF values were observed. Among the three PSCs, the PNDI-Th10-based device exhibited the best PCE value of 5.88% with a VOC of 0.866 V, a JSC of 10.77 mA cm−2, and a FF of 63.53%. Based on morphology and charge dynamics, the improved performance of the PNDI-Th10-based device was found to have originated from the synergistic effects of the preferential π-face-on crystal orientation with relatively large crystallites and suppression of bimolecular/geminate recombination. This study demonstrates a very simple and effective strategy to circumvent the JSC–VOC trade-off often caused by modifying the structures of well-performing conjugated polymers.
Experimental section
Materials measurement
All starting materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Acros and used without further purification. All solvents were of ACS grade unless otherwise noted. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a VNMRS 600 (Agilent, USA) spectrophotometer using C2H2Cl4 as the solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard. UV-Vis-NIR spectra were recorded on a UV-1800 (SHIMADZU) spectrophotometer. DFT calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 package with the nonlocal hybrid Becke three-parameter Lee–Yang–Parr (B3LYP) function and the 6-31G* basis set to elucidate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and LUMO levels after optimizing the geometry of polymers using the same method. The number-average (Mn) and weight average (Mw) molecular weights, and the polydispersity index (PDI) of the polymer products were determined by HT-GPC with Agilent 1200 HPLC and miniDAWN TREOS using polystyrene as the standard in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene at 120 °C (HPLC grade). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed using a differential scanning calorimeter (TA instruments, USA) with a scan rate of 10 °C per minute. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed on a Solartron electrochemical station (METEK, Versa STAT3) with a three-electrode cell in a 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (n-Bu4NPF6) solution in acetonitrile at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 at room temperature. An Ag/Ag+ (0.01 M AgNO3 in acetonitrile) electrode, a platinum wire, and a polymer-coated platinum electrode were used as the reference electrode, the counter electrode, and the working electrode, respectively. The Ag/Ag+ reference electrode was calibrated using a ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple as an internal standard, whose oxidation potential is set at −4.8 eV with respect to the zero vacuum level. The HOMO energy levels were obtained from the equation HOMO (eV) = LUMO − Eoptg. The LUMO levels of the polymers were obtained from the equation LUMO (eV) = −4.8 − (Efirst1/2red − EFc/Fc+1/2ox).
Synthesis of PNDI-Fu10
The monomer NDI-Br2 (100 mg, 0.10 mmol), T2-Sn2 (44 mg, 0.09 mmol), Fu-Sn2 (3.9 mg, 0.01 mmol), Pd2(dba3) (2.0 mg, 3.0 μmol) and P(o-tolyl)3 (3.0 mg, 12 μmol) were dissolved in toluene (10 mL) under argon conditions. The sealed reaction flask was then stirred at 100 °C for 48 h. Then, excess 2-(trimethylstannyl) thiophene was added and the reaction mixture was stirred at 100 °C for another 24 h. Finally, excess 2-bromothiophene was added and the reaction mixture was stirred for another 24 h. The mixture was cooled to room temperature and precipitated in methanol (100 mL). The precipitate was filtered and washed with methanol, acetone, and hexane successively in a Soxhlet apparatus to remove oligomers and catalyst. Finally, the polymer was extracted with chloroform. The chloroform fraction was concentrated and precipitated in methanol. The precipitate was filtered and dried under vacuum. The dark blue product was isolated in 81% yield. 1H NMR (600 MHz, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane-d2): δ(ppm) 9.23 (br, 0.2H), 8.88 (br, 2H), 7.65 (br, 0.2H), 7.41 (br, 4H), 4.18 (br, 4H), 2.08 (br, 2H), 1.41–1.23 (br, 64H), 0.90 (br, 12H).

Fabrication and characterization of solar cells
A conventional device (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINO/Al) was fabricated. PEDOT:PSS (Bayer Baytron 4083) was spin-coated at 4000 rpm onto an ITO substrate by annealing at 140 °C for 20 minutes in air. The active layer was spin-coated from a chloroform solution of donor and acceptor polymers (12 mg ml−1) onto the PEDOT:PSS layer and subsequent thermal annealing at 120 °C for 10 minutes. After this PDINO dissolved in methanol was deposited onto the active layer with a spin rate of 3000 rpm for 30 s and 100 nm aluminum (Al) was thermally evaporated under vacuum (<5.0 × 10−5 Pa). In all device systems, 1vol% of DIO was added.
The J–V characteristics were performed using a Keithley 2400 source under illumination of an AM 1.5G solar simulator with an intensity of 100 Mw cm−2. The EQE measurement was investigated in ambient air using an EQE system (Model QEX7) by PV measurements Inc. (Boulder, Colorado). The hole and electron mobilities were measured by the SCLC method with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au for hole-only and ITO/ZnO/active layer/PDINO/Al for electron-only cases.
