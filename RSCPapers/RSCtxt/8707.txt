The results indicate that the introduction of Cu2Se remarkably lowers the thermal conductivity of the composite system. Especially, the thermal conductivity of CuGaTe2/3 vol% Cu2Se decreases to 0.54 W m−1 K−1 at 859 K, which allows its ZT to reach 1.2 at 834 K.
1. Introduction
Because fossil fuels will be running out, many researchers naturally have studied ways to develop eco-friendly and renewable energy power generation.1 The past two decades have witnessed increased interest in the field of thermoelectrics driven by the compelling need for more efficient and environmentally friendly energy conversion technologies.2–4 But the relatively low efficiencies of the current thermoelectric (TE) device limit their large-scale commercialization.5 The efficiency of the TE device is determined by the TE figure of merit ZT (ZT = S2σT/κ), where S, σ, T, and κ are the Seebeck coefficient, the electric conductivity, the absolute temperature, and the thermal conductivity, respectively. Therefore, in order to improve the efficiency of the TE device, it is very imperative to search for the materials with high ZT values. Thus many methods have been utilized to improve the ZT value of TE materials, among which introduction of the second phase with nanostructures is an effectual way to enhance the TE performance.6–13
CuGaTe2 is a p-type semiconductor with a band gap of approximately 1.2 eV (ref. 14) and it has a chalcopyrite structure with the space group I2d. Structurally, it is very different from the chemically related compounds, PbTe and AgSbTe2, as it is tetrahedrally bonded, rather than octahedral.15 Previously, CuGaTe2 has been widely investigated as a promising candidate for thin film solar cells, photovoltaic devices, and so on.16–20 Recently, it has been reported as a promising candidate for TE materials.14,21 Theerayuth Plirdpring et al.14 found out that pure CuGaTe2 has a high ZT value at high temperature above 800 K. However, the TE properties of CuGaTe2 have scarcely been investigated systematically. In order to tailor the TE performance of CuGaTe2 as a p-type semiconductor, CuGaTe2 based composites incorporated with nanophase Cu2Se were synthesized here. Recent study shows that Cu2Se presents a good TE performance with ZT values of ∼1.5 near 1000 K.22–24 It have very low lattice thermal conductivity in the high temperature range due to its extraordinary ‘liquid-like’ behavior of copper ions around a crystalline sublattice of Se in Cu2Se.24 And the crystal structure of Cu2Se presents a low symmetry, a monoclinic phase near the room temperature, while it changes to the high symmetry cubic structure above 473 K.22,25 We expect that the incorporation of nanophase Cu2Se in CuGaTe2 could improve the TE performance of the composite system by phonon blocking due to phase boundary scattering. In this work, TE properties of the composite system were investigated in the temperature range from 300 K to 860 K, which shows that introduction of nanophase Cu2Se into CuGaTe2 causes large reduction of lattice thermal conductivity κL, allowing ZT to reach 1.2 at 859 K in the composite system containing 3 vol% Cu2Se.
2. Experimental schedule
Polycrystals of CuGaTe2 compound samples were prepared by a fusion method. Elementary copper (99.99 wt%), silver (99.99 wt%), tellurium (99.999 wt%) powders and gallium chunk were weighed accurately to give the desired composition, and sealed in an evacuated quartz tube, which were heat-treated in a horizontal furnace at 1323 K for 24 hours with the heating rate fixed at 2 K min−1. The Cu2Se nanopowders were synthesized by the reduction method.26 The CuGaTe2 based composite samples embedded with nanophase Cu2Se were prepared by milling for 2 h in an agate mortar. The bulk specimens for transport property measurements were obtained by hot-pressing (623 K, 300 MPa) in a vacuum.
The phase structures and the compositions of the obtained samples were checked using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). XRD analysis was carried out on a Philips diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation. The accurate lattice parameters were determined from the d values of the XRD peaks using a standard least-squares refinement method with a Si standard for calibration. Microstructures were studied by using high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HTEM; JEOL JEM-2010) operating at a 200 kV accelerating voltage. The density of hot-pressed bulk samples was determined by the Archimedes method and found to be at least 98% of the theoretical density. The resistivity ρ and the Seebeck coefficient S were measured by using a commercially available instrument (ULVAC, ZEM-3) in a He atmosphere. Thermal diffusivity (α) was measured by the laser flash method using the Netzsch LFA 457 instrument. The heat capacity Cp was obtained with a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) (Perkin-Elmer, USA). Thermal conductivity κ was calculated based on the relationship κ = αCpd, where d is the density of the sample determined by Archimedes' method. The Hall coefficients were measured using the Van der Pauw technique under a magnetic field of 0.72 T.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) shows the XRD patterns of our polycrystalline samples, almost all diffraction peaks can be indexed to the phase of CuGaTe2 (PDF#65-0244) belonging to the chalcopyrite structure, indicating that the specimens have the same crystallographic structure as that of CuGaTe2. Moreover, several diffraction peaks from the Cu2Se phase appear in XRD patterns of the composites, and the intensity of these peaks increases with increasing Cu2Se content, which indicates that other than the two constituent phases (CuGaTe2 and Cu2Se) no obvious impurity phase forms. The values of the lattice parameters a and c for all samples have been calculated from the XRD data, as shown in Table 1. Parameters a = 5.9943 × 10−10 m and c = 11.9843 × 10−10 m for pure CuGaTe2, which were slightly different from the reported data (a = 6.016 × 10−10 m and c = 11.942 × 10−10 m).14 It could be seen that the lattice parameter a increased rapidly with increasing Cu2Se content x from 0 to 7 vol%. In contrast, the parameter c decreased with increasing Cu2Se content except the sample with x = 3 vol%, indicating that the lattice distortion occurred in the CuGaTe2 crystal lattice. This lattice distortion would lead to the increase of hole concentration, as discussed below. Fig. 1(b) shows the low-magnification bright-field TEM image of CuGaTe2/3 vol% Cu2Se, which shows that the microstructure of the composite samples is composed of both some large grains (>100 nm) and smaller ones (<∼100 nm). Fig. 1(c) shows the lattice image of the rectangle area in Fig. 1(b), from which one can clearly see that the smaller grains belong to Cu2Se that are embedded in the CuGaTe2 matrix, forming CuGaTe2/xCu2Se bulk nanocomposites, in agreement with the result obtained from XRD analysis.

The thermoelectric properties of Cu2Se dispersed CuGaTe2 composites are depicted in Fig. 2 and 3. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the resistivity ρ(T) of the matrix CuGaTe2 decreases steeply with increasing temperature, showing non-degenerate semiconducting behavior. In contrast, ρ for the CuGaTe2/xCu2Se composite sample with x = 3 vol% decreases much slowly with increasing temperature. Especially, the ρ(T) for the composite CuGaTe2/xCu2Se with x = 5 vol% and 7 vol% increases with increasing temperature, signifying that they become a degenerate state. Moreover, one can see that the resistivity ρ of the CuGaTe2/xCu2Se composite decreases with increasing Cu2Se content x. For instance, it decreases from 29.2 to 7.09, then to 3.20 and 1.18 × 10−5 Ω m, as x increase from x = 0 to 3 vol%, 5 vol% and 7 vol%, respectively. The change from the non-degenerate to the generate state and the decrease of ρ with increasing Cu2Se content x can be attributed to the remarkable increase of hole concentration caused by introducing the second phase, which is verified by measurements of the Hall carrier concentration p, as listed in Table 1. It can be seen from Table 1 that the hole concentration of pure CuGaTe2 is 4.60 × 1018 cm−3 at room temperature, which is slightly different from the reported data (p = 1.1 × 1018 cm−3 (ref. 14) and p = 2.05 × 1019 cm−3 (ref. 27)). The hole concentration increases remarkably (about three orders of magnitude) after the incorporation of Cu2Se. For instance, at room temperature the hole concentration increases monotonically from 4.60 × 1018 cm−3 to 1.39 × 1021 cm−3 and then to 4.01 × 1022 cm−3 as Cu2Se content x increases from 0 to 3 vol% and 7 vol%, respectively.

Since the lattice mismatching between CuGaTe2 and Cu2Se, the introduction of Cu2Se will produce lattice distortion and point defects e.g. vacancies of Cu and/or Ga in the CuGaTe2 matrix, such as  and .28 And the lattice distortion has been verified by the measured lattice parameters as seen in Table 1. This means that the incorporation of Cu2Se would introduce acceptor levels into the gap and gave rise to the increase in hole concentration.29 This is to say, the introduction of Cu2Se acts as holes doping in this system.
All the samples have positive values of S, which indicates that they belong to p-type semiconductors, as shown in Fig. 2(b). Moreover, the temperature behaviors of S for all the samples are similar: S first increases with increasing temperature and then decreases with further increasing temperature, leaving a peak at a certain temperature. The decreases of S at high temperature regimes can be ascribed to intrinsic excitation or thermal activation of minority of carriers in the samples. In addition, one notices that the peak in the S–T plots shifts to higher temperatures (from ∼600 K to ∼790 K) as Cu2Se content x increases from 0 to 7 vol%, which suggests that the intrinsic excitation dominates transport behavior at higher temperature as Cu2Se content x increases due to increases in hole concentration, as demonstrated in Table 1. Furthermore, the increased hole concentration p also explains why S decreases monotonically with increasing Cu2Se content, for S is inversely proportional to carrier concentration p, as expressed by the Mott equation: (1)where σ is the electrical conductivity, q is the carrier charge, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and Ef is the Fermi energy. Basically, the power factor (PF = S2/ρ) increases with increasing temperature. But for the composite samples CuGaTe2/xCu2Se with x > 3 vol%, S decreases with increasing temperature at T > ∼650 K due to large decreases in S at high temperatures for these samples (as seen in Fig. 2(b)). A maximum PF is achieved at 859 K, 834 K, 733 K and 735 K in the investigated temperature range for the samples with x = 0, 3 vol%, 5 vol%, 7 vol%, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2(c).
As shown in Fig. 3(a), the thermal conductivity (κ) of the CuGaTe2/xCu2Se composite was significantly decreased as compared to that of matrix CuGaTe2 in a temperature range of 600–860 K. This reduction in total thermal conductivity of the composites could be ascribed to stronger photon scattering by the newly formed interfaces between CuGaTe2 and Cu2Se. The total thermal conductivity is the sum of the hole component (κh) and the phonon component (κL), in which κh = LT/ρ (L = 1.5 × 10−8 V2 K−2)30 according to the Wiedemann–Franz law. Fig. 3(b) shows the temperature dependence of κh. The phonon conductivity was obtained by extracting κh from κ, which is displayed in Fig. 3(c). The addition of Cu2Se leads to reduced lattice thermal conductivity κL due to enhanced phonon scattering, especially at high temperatures. However, one notices that κL of the composite samples with x = 5 vol% is greater than that of CuGaTe2 at T < ∼600 K, similar to the case of B4C/TiO2.31 This phenomenon could be chiefly ascribed to microstructure differences between the specimens, i.e. less porosity in the specimen with x = 5 vol%. As shown in Table 1, the relative density Dr (=D/DTH) of the composite sample with x = 5 vol% has the largest value 99.7% that is around 2% larger than that (97.9%) of the sample with x = 0 (meaning that there are ∼2% less pores in the composite sample with x = 5 vol%), and theoretical and experimental results32,33 indicate that lattice thermal conductivity will increase with decreasing porosity. Hence, it is understandable that the composite specimen with x = 5 vol% displays the largest lattice thermal conductivity at T < ∼600 K. Besides, one can see from Fig. 3 that both the total thermal conductivity and lattice thermal conductivity of the composite samples show a fast decrease around 600 K. According to ref. 24, the copper ions in Cu2Se are highly disordered around the Se sublattice and are superionic with liquid-like mobility. This extraordinary ‘liquid-like’ behavior of copper ions in Cu2Se results in an intrinsically very low lattice thermal conductivity in the high temperature range, which could explain why κL of the composite samples (that contain Cu2Se as a constituent phase) shows a fast decrease at ∼600 K.
As a result of the reduced lattice thermal conductivity κL a highest dimensionless figure of merit ZT = 1.2 is achieved in CuGaTe2/3 vol% Cu2Se at 834 K, as shown in Fig. 3(d). This value of ZT is ∼74% larger than that of matrix CuGaTe2 at the same temperature. Besides, this value is also obviously larger than the reported ZT values in ref. 14 (ZT = 0.91 at 834 K),21 (ZT = 1.07 at 721 K for Cu0.98GaSb0.02Te2) and27 (ZT = 0.91 at 701 K for CuGa0.36In0.64Te2). The present result suggests that incorporation of Cu2Se in CuGaTe2 is an effective way to elevate the thermoelectric performance of CuGaTe2.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized CuGaTe2/xCu2Se composites (0 ≤ x ≤ 7 vol%) by the fusion method, and investigated their thermoelectric properties in the temperature range of 300–860 K. After the introduction of Cu2Se, the carrier concentration increases, and the thermal conductivity of the composite is obviously smaller than that of matrix CuGaTe2. As a result, the thermoelectric performance of CuGaTe2 remarkably enhances. A highest ZT = 1.2 is achieved at 834 K for the composite sample CuGaTe2/3 vol% Cu2Se, which is 74% larger than that of CuGaTe2. The enhancement of thermoelectric performance is owed to its lower thermal conductivity and improved electrical resistivity. All the results indicate that incorporation of nanophase Cu2Se is an effective method to enhance the thermoelectric performance of CuGaTe2.
