    , Accepted 17th April 2022First published on 18th April 2022AbstractThe photo and biocatalyst hybrid system is one of the most ideal artificial photosynthetic systems using solar energy to synthesize various chemicals and fuels. This study was devoted to achieving visible-light-driven molecular conversion with various enzymes using the NADH regeneration system consisting of an electron donor such as triethanol amine (TEOA), zinc tetraphenylporphyrin tetrasulfonate (ZnTPPS) as a photosensitizer and colloidal polyvinylpyrrolidone-dispersed rhodium nanoparticles (Rh-PVP) as a catalyst. The irradiation wavelength dependence of NADH regeneration with the system of TEOA, ZnTPPS, Rh-PVP and NAD+ was studied and the quantum efficiency for NADH regeneration at monochromatic 420 nm due to the Soret band of ZnTPPS was estimated to be ca. 0.0012%. This NADH regeneration system was also applied to various enzyme-catalyzed redox reactions. By using this NADH regeneration system in the presence of lactate or D-3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenases, various enantioselective molecular conversions by visible-light energy were accomplished. By using this NADH regeneration and malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating), photo and biocatalytic CO2 fixation to organic molecules based on carbon–carbon bond formation between pyruvate and CO2 has been successfully achieved. The results not only show an example of colloidal metal nanoparticles used as a catalyst for selective NADH regeneration in general artificial photosynthesis but also the selective production of chemicals/solar fuels directly from CO2 with visible-light energy.
Introduction
The conversion of solar energy into chemical energy has received much attention and remains a significant challenge. As one of the solar energy conversion technologies, artificial photosynthesis is the most promising method for producing fuels or organic chemicals.1–3 Although a lot of research on artificial photosynthetic systems has been conducted, most of these systems used only photocatalytic materials, such as semiconductors, transition-metal complexes, and so on.4–6 Thus, many problems remain, such as low selectivity of products and limited expansion of substrates.7,8 On the other hand, the photo and biocatalyst hybrid system is one of the most ideal artificial photosynthetic systems using solar energy to synthesize various chemicals and fuels, because biocatalysts have high catalytic activity and selectivity under ambient conditions.9 Enzymes catalyze more than 5000 types of biochemical reactions, which is impossible to accomplish using molecular or heterogenous catalysts.10,11 Oxidoreductases are types of biocatalysts that mainly convert molecules with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and its reduced form (NADH) as cofactors.12–14 NADH is widely used as a cofactor with the function of an electron donor in various biological enzymatic redox reactions.12–14 As the supply of NADH is a major challenging factor due to its high cost and low stability, the development of effective NADH regeneration systems has been stimulated.15,16 Various NADH regeneration systems using chemical processes,17–19 and biocatalytic, electrochemical,20–28 photochemical,29–49 homogeneous,50 and heterogeneous15,51 catalytic methods have been investigated. Compared with these methods, photochemical NADH regeneration has attracted much attention because solar energy is clean, inexpensive, abundant, and renewable. Since energetically 46% of the total solar light is in the visible region,52 the photocatalyst must have catalytic activity in the visible range for solar energy conversion. As a simple NAD+ reduction to NADH with visible-light energy, NAD+ was directly reduced with a photosensitizer such as a water-soluble porphyrin which has absorption bands in the visible light region. However, a single electron reduced NAD+ (NAD radical) is formed and can undergo dimerization to a biologically inactive reduction product. In the non-enzymatic NADH regeneration, it has been reported that enzymatically inactive by-products (1,2-NADH isomer, 1,6-NADH isomer, and NAD dimer) are produced.53 Therefore, a photoredox system for NADH regeneration needs an effective catalyst that prevents NAD+ dimerization and has high selectivity.
The photoredox system that mimicks natural photosynthesis has three major components: a photosensitizer, an electron mediator, and a catalyst for NADH regeneration.54–56 An example of the enzymatic reduction of NAD+ is a photoredox system with ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR, EC 1.18.1.2) as a catalyst, and 1,1′-dimethyl-4,4′-bipyridinium salt as an electron mediator between the photosensitizer and FNR.57 Although this system has high selectivity for NADH regeneration, it has drawbacks in durability, cost, and scalability of FNR that is an expensive biological reagent. As examples of catalysts for non-enzymatic photoreduction of NAD+ to NADH, organometallic complexes, particularly, the Rh complex, [Cp*Rh(bpy)(H2O)]2+ (Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl, bpy = 2,2′-bipyridyl), have been widely used as catalysts for electron and hydride transfer in the presence of a photosensitizer and studied for the regiospecific reduction of NAD+ to NADH because of their versatile range of application and regiospecific activity.58–66 However, the main focus has been drawn to the development of photocatalysts to increase the efficiency of NADH regeneration, as it depends on the electron relay from a photocatalyst to the Rh complex catalyst. In the case of [Cp*Rh(bpy)(H2O)]2+, as Cp* and 2,2′-bpy are essential ligands for the NAD+ reduction catalyst, the variation of the compound is limited for the development of functionalized Rh complexes. In addition, it has been reported that metal complexes sometimes act directly as inhibitors of enzymes.67–69 For these reasons, few studies have focused on the structure and function of Rh complexes in improving the efficiency of photocatalytic NADH regeneration. As described above, since the photocatalytic NADH regeneration system requires high reaction selectivity, no effective catalyst other than the Rh complex has been discovered yet. On the other hand, catalysts with various activities based on noble metal nanoparticles have been developed. Since metal nanoparticles are larger in size than the metal complex, particles cannot bind to the active site of enzymes and do not function as an inhibitor. Furthermore, research on stabilization by immobilizing the enzyme on the surface of metal nanoparticles has also been reported.70 In particular, colloidal noble metal nanoparticles can be used for homogeneous catalytic reactions and have the potential to be used as NADH regeneration catalysts. The advantage of colloidal noble metal nanoparticles is that they can be easily prepared by reduction of metal chloride with alcohol such as ethanol. In addition, it is also possible to control their catalytic activity with a material that disperses the noble metal nanoparticles in a colloidal state. For example, we have reported that the catalytic activity for hydrogen production based on formate decomposition of colloidal platinum nanoparticles can be controlled by using polymer dispersants such as polyacrylate, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and so on.71,72 We also discovered the catalytic activity for NADH regeneration of homogeneous colloidal rhodium nanoparticles dispersed by a polymer as a novel type of catalyst.73 We also previously reported visible-light-driven regioselective NAD+ reduction to 1,4-NADH using a system of triethanolamine (TEOA) as an electron donor, water-soluble zinc porphyrin, zinc tetraphenylporphyrin tetrasulfonate (ZnTPPS) as a photosensitizer, and colloidal Rh nanoparticles dispersed by PVP (Rh-PVP) as a catalyst, as shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Scheme of visible-light-driven NADH regeneration with a system consisting of TEOA as an electron donor, ZnTPPS as a photosensitizer, Rh-PVP as a catalyst and NAD+. 
As described above, colloidal noble metal nanoparticles have greater potential than metal complexes obtained by a complicated synthetic method because colloidal nanoparticles are easy to prepare and their properties can be controlled by using a polymer dispersant. Metal clusters composed of no more than one hundred metal atoms dispersed by a polymer in addition to colloidal noble metal nanoparticles have also been reported as effective homogeneous catalysts for specific hydrogenation and oxidation reactions.74,75 In the case of metal clusters as well, it has been found that their catalytic activity is variously controlled by using dispersants such as polymers and ligands. Thus, it is a great advantage that colloidal nanoparticles or nanoclusters in a metallic state can be used as a homogeneous catalyst as in the bulk reaction.
On the other hand, by incorporating a NAD+-dependent dehydrogenase as shown in Fig. 2 into the system of Fig. 1, various visible-light-driven molecular conversion techniques can be established.

Fig. 2 shows the examples of the reactions catalyzed by various NAD+-dependent dehydrogenases. These enzymes have achieved rigorous enantioselective synthesis that cannot be achieved with homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts. In addition, enzymes with the function of CO2 fixation have also attracted a lot of attention in response to global warming and the depletion of fossil fuels in recent years.76 As a model of enantioselective synthesis, the NADH regeneration system using visible-light energy was applied in the enzymatic reduction of pyruvate to L-lactate with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and acetoacetate reduction to D-3-hydroxybutyrate with D-3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBDH). As a model of CO2 fixation, a regioselective NAD+ reduction system was applied to L-malate synthesis based on CO2 fixation to pyruvate with malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating; MDH) using visible-light energy. Lactate, 3-hydroxybutyrate, and malate are raw materials for biodegradable polymers.77–79 The synthesis of raw materials for biodegradable polymers and the utilization of CO2 as a feedstock for application in the field of photoredox catalysis systems open a new path to sustainable chemistry using renewable energy. Using the photo/biocatalyst hybrid system for the artificial photosynthesis process is one of the most promising methods of solar energy conversion for the synthesis of organic materials or fuels.
In this work, we are devoted to applying a visible-light-driven NADH regeneration system using ZnTPPS and Rh-PVP in the presence of an electron donor to various enzymatic reactions. In particular, biocatalytic CO2 fixation to organic molecules based on carbon–carbon (C–C) bond formation between CO2 and organic substances was attempted. First, the effect of the electron donor on NADH regeneration and the optimal concentration for an electron donor were investigated. Next, the catalytic activity of Rh-PVP was compared with that of [Cp*Rh(bpy)(H2O)]2+, widely used as a catalyst for NADH regeneration. The photochemical NAD+ reduction activity of Rh-PVP was also tested in the presence of TiO2 in place of ZnTPPS. In addition, the irradiation wavelength dependence of NADH regeneration was studied. By using the optimized NADH regeneration system, enzymatic reactions with visible-light energy were performed.

The sample suspension in the quartz cell equipped with a magnetic stirrer was irradiated continuously with a 400 W Xe lamp (USHIO, SX-UI-500XQ) at ambient temperature. The light intensity on the surface of the reaction tube was 80 mW cm−2, measured with a laser power meter (model AN/2, Ophir Optronics, Inc.).

Measurement to determine the irradiation wavelength dependence of NADH regeneration with the system of TEOA, ZnTPPS and Rh-PVP was performed under monochromatic irradiation, emitted from a Xe lamp (Asahi Spectra Co. Ltd, MAX-303) equipped with bandpass filters (central wavelength: 400, 420, 500, 560, 600, and 700 nm; full width at half maximum: 10 nm) and a variable neutral density filter. Monochromatic photon fluxes at each wavelength were measured using a photo power meter (Hioki E. E. Co., 3664) equipped with a Si photodiode sensor (Hioki E. E. Co., 9742).

Visible-light-driven molecular conversion proceeded in the NADH regeneration system combined with various enzymes. Lactate (LDH), 3-hydroxybutyrate (HBDH), and malate (decarboxylating; MDH) dehydrogenases were applied in the visible-light-driven NADH regeneration system for the enantioselective synthesis and CO2 fixation. The sample solution in the quartz cell equipped with a magnetic stirrer was irradiated with a 250 W halogen lamp (Panasonic) with a light intensity of 200 J m−2 s−1 at 30 °C. Ultraviolet rays with a wavelength shorter than 390 nm were blocked with a cut-off filter. The concentration of lactate, D-3-hydroxybutyrate, or malate produced was analyzed using an ion chromatography system (Metrohm Eco IC; electrical conductivity detector) with an ion exclusion column (Metrohm Metrosep Organic Acid – 250/7.8; column length: 250 × 7.8 mm; composed of a polystyrene/divinylbenzene copolymer with sulfonic acid groups; temperature: 35 °C). 1.0 mM perchloric acid and 50 mM lithium chloride were used as an eluent and a regenerant, respectively.
Visible-light-driven pyruvate reduction to L-lactate with the system of TEOA, ZnTPPS, Rh-PVP, NAD+ and LDH

The concentration of D- or L-lactate produced was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The products were analyzed using an HPLC system containing a Shodex ORpak CRX-853 column (8.0 × 50 mm, 6.0 mm particle size), a Shimadzu LC-20AD SP pump, and a Shimadzu SPD-20A UV-Vis detector (detection wavelength: 230 nm).

Results and discussion
Effect of the electron donor and the concentration of TEOA on NADH regeneration with the system of TEOA, ZnTPPS and Rh-PVP
Electron donors are necessary for the stable photosensitizer redox cycle in a common photoredox system.88 Hydrogen is an attractive electron donor owing to its strong reducibility. Hydrogen is clean and abundant, but it also has drawbacks such as easy leakage.89 2-Mercaptoethanol has strong reducibility with a redox potential of −0.26 V at pH 7.0,90 but it is toxic and expensive. Considering facile handling, environmental compatibility, and low cost, several types of electron donors were selected, such as EDTA, TEOA, DEOA, NTA, TEA, and L-ascorbate (chemical structures are shown in Fig. 3).
 Fig. 3  The chemical structures of electron donors. 
The concentration of NADH produced in the HEPS–NaOH buffer (pH 7.4) containing ZnTPPS (4.6 μM), Rh-PVP (Rh concentration: 50 μM) and NAD+ (1.0 mM) after 300 min irradiation in the presence of various electron donors (200 mM) is shown in Fig. 4. When using either EDTA or TEOA, the concentration of NADH produced after 300 min irradiation was estimated to be 51 and 49 μM, respectively. Using DEOA, NTA, and TEA, the concentration of NADH produced was estimated to be less than 35 μM, lower than those of EDTA and TEOA. On the other hand, by using L-ascorbate, a trace amount of NADH was produced.
 Fig. 4  The concentration of NADH in the system of ZnTPPS and Rh-PVP after 300 min irradiation with different electron donors. 
Here, the standard redox potential of ZnTPPS/ZnTPPS+ (oxidized form of ZnTPPS) is reported to be 0.86 V (vs. SHE at pH 7.0).91 The redox potential for L-ascorbate (HA−/HA˙) was reported to be 0.46 V (vs. SHE).92,93 This indicates that the electron donating ability of L-ascorbate is high enough to reduce ZnTPPS+ to ZnTPPS. On the other hand, the nitrogen atom of EDTA, TEOA, DEOA, NTA or TEA might be easily coordinated with water-soluble zinc porphyrin through non-covalent interaction to achieve intramolecular transfer of electrons.94 Thus, the NADH production yield in the presence of L-ascorbate was lower than those of the other electron donors.
Here, let us discuss the process of NADH production by fluorescence quenching of ZnTPPS by various electron donors. Quenching of the photoexcited state of ZnTPPS by Rh-PVP or NAD+ was investigated using steady state fluorescence spectroscopy.
The sample solution contained ZnTPPS (1.0 μM) and the electron donor (0–400 mM) in 50 mM HEPES–NaOH buffer (pH 7.4). The excitation wavelength was 422 nm due to the Soret band of ZnTPPS. The fluorescence emission spectrum of ZnTPPS was measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (SHIMADZU, RF-5300 PC) with a 150 W xenon lamp as a visible excitation light source. Excitation and emission band-passes were 5.0 nm. Fig. 5 shows the relationship between the relative fluorescence intensity of ZnTPPS at 605 nm and the concentration of the electron donor.
 Fig. 5  Relationship between the relative fluorescence intensity of ZnTPPS at 605 nm and the concentration of the electron donor. 
As shown in Fig. 5, no fluorescence quenching of ZnTPPS was observed using electron donors except L-ascorbate. From these results, it is predicted that the oxidative quenching process shown in Fig. 6(a) will proceed with an electron donor other than L-ascorbate. On the other hand, the fluorescence quenching of ZnTPPS was observed by using L-ascorbate as an electron donor. This indicates that the excited state of ZnTPPS reacts with L-ascorbate before the reduction of NAD+via Rh-PVP. Thus, it is predicted that the oxidative quenching process shown in Fig. 6(b) will proceed with L-ascorbate.
 Fig. 6  Oxidative (a) and reductive quenching processes in the system of electron donor (ED), ZnTPPS, Rh-PVP and NAD+. 
From these results, it is found that the reduction rate of NAD+ to NADH decreased in the system of L-ascorbate, ZnTPPS and Rh-PVP. Although the NADH production yield with EDTA was slightly higher than that for TEOA, ZnTPPS was decomposed with increasing irradiation time in the presence of EDTA. As EDTA is a chelating agent, it is expected that EDTA forms a complex with a metal ion of a cofactor for the enzyme. Thus, TEOA was selected as a suitable electron donor for visible-light-driven NADH regeneration with the system of ZnTPPS and Rh-PVP.
Next let us focus on the effect of the concentration of TEOA on the visible-light-driven NAD+ reduction to NADH. A sample solution containing TEOA (0–400 mM), ZnTPPS (4.6 μM), Rh-PVP (Rh metal concentration: 50 μM), and NAD+ (1.0 mM) was used.

Fig. 7 shows the concentration of NADH produced in the system of TEOA, ZnTPPS and Rh-PVP after 300 min irradiation with visible light. When the concentration of TEOA was increased to 250 mM, the NADH concentration after 300 min irradiation reached 61 μM. The concentration of NADH produced increases as the TEOA concentration increases, and reaches a maximum or a constant value near the TEOA concentration of 250 mM in the system of ZnTPPS and Rh-PVP. The role of the electron donor is to regenerate ZnTPPS in the ground state by injecting an electron into the single-electron oxidized ZnTPPS.
 Fig. 7  Effect of the TEOA concentration on the NADH yield in the system of ZnTPPS and Rh-PVP after 300 min irradiation. 
Thus, the efficiency of photoinduced electron utilization is decreased under a lower concentration of an electron donor. Therefore, NADH production decreased under lower TEOA concentration. On the other hand, when the TEOA concentration was further increased (>200 mM), NADH production decreased. The reason for this phenomenon is still unclear at this time. However, some research reported the same phenomenon, and a large amount of photo-generated electrons associated with a higher TEOA concentration will cause the reoxidation of NADH.95,96 Thus, the visible-light-driven NAD+ reduction rate depends on the TEOA concentration. Thus, the optimal concentration of TEOA for NADH regeneration was estimated to be over 200 mM.
Comparison of Rh-PVP and [Cp*Rh(bpy)(H2O)]2+ in photocatalytic NADH regeneration
Here, the catalytic activity for NADH regeneration using visible light was compared between Rh-PVP and [Cp*Rh(bpy)(H2O)]2+, where the latter is a widely used catalyst for NAD+ reduction. The sample solution containing TEOA (200 mM), ZnTPPS (4.6 μM), Rh-PVP or [Cp*Rh(bpy)(H2O)]2+ (50 μM), and NAD+ (1.0 mM) in the HEPES–NaOH buffer (pH 7.4) was irradiated with visible light. The time dependence of the concentration of NADH produced with Rh-PVP or [Cp*Rh(bpy)(H2O)]2+ is shown in Fig. 8. When Rh-PVP or [Cp*Rh(bpy)(H2O)]2+ was used, the concentration of NADH produced increased with irradiation time. For the Rh-PVP and [Cp*Rh(bpy)(H2O)]2+, the NADH concentration after 300 min of irradiation was estimated to be 49 and 79 μM, respectively. The turnover number (TON) of Rh-PVP or [Cp*Rh(bpy)(H2O)]2+ after 300 min of irradiation was estimated to be 0.99 or 1.6, respectively. Based on these results, Rh-PVP has about 85% of the catalytic activity of [Cp*Rh(bpy)(H2O)]2+ under the current conditions.
 Fig. 8  Time dependence of the concentration of NADH produced with the system of TEOA, ZnTPPS and Rh-PVP or [Cp*Rh(bpy)(H2O)]2+. 
At first glance, these results show that Rh-PVP has lower catalytic activity for NADH regeneration than that of [Cp*Rh(bpy)(H2O)]2+. Since the colloidal nanoparticles are formed by assembled Rh atoms, both of the surface and bulk of the nanoparticles were composed of Rh atoms. Only Rh atoms on the surface of the Rh-PVP function as catalysts for NADH regeneration. Therefore, the number of Rh atoms on the surface (Ns, mol g−1) was calculated from the average particle size (ca. 4 nm; Fig. S1†) of Rh-PVP using TEM using eqn (2).97,98 (2)here, S and V are the surface area (nm2) and volume (nm3) of nanoparticles, respectively. The ds and dv are the density of Rh atoms, 13.3 atoms nm−2 and 1.24 × 10−20 g nm−3, respectively. As a result of calculation using eqn (2), the Ns value of Rh-PVP was estimated to be 1.3 × 10−3 mol g−1. The total amount of Rh in the NADH regeneration system was calculated to be 25.7 μg (50 μM of Rh in the total volume of sample solution). Thus, the number of Rh atoms on the surface was estimated to be 3.3 × 10−8 mol, and the effective Rh atom concentration for the NADH regeneration system was estimated to be 6.7 μM. Recalculating TON with the effective Rh atomic concentration was estimated to be 7.3, and Rh-PVP catalytically reduces NAD+ to NADH.
In addition, the catalytic activity of Rh-PVP was also tested with TiO2 as a photosensitizer instead of ZnTPPS. The sample suspension containing TEOA, TiO2, Rh-PVP, and NAD+ was irradiated with a Xe lamp as a light source. The absorbance of the sample at 340 nm increased with irradiation time; thus, NADH production also proceeded with TiO2. The concentration of NADH after 120 min irradiation was estimated to be 74 μM without the Rh catalyst, 131 μM with Rh-PVP, and 200 μM with [Cp*Rh(bpy)(H2O)]2+ from the enzymatic assay as shown in Fig. 9. On the other hand, the NAD dimer was also produced; the concentrations of the NAD dimer were estimated to be 81 μM without the Rh catalyst, 31 μM with Rh-PVP, and 200 μM with [Cp*Rh(bpy)(H2O)]2+.
 Fig. 9  The concentration of NADH or NAD dimer produced and the selectivity of NADH after 120 min irradiation with TiO2 as a photosensitizer under various catalysts. 
Thus, the selectivities for NADH production were estimated to be 48% without the Rh catalyst, 81% with Rh-PVP, and 86% with [Cp*Rh(bpy)(H2O)]2+. NADH production using Rh-PVP was higher than that without the Rh catalyst, and NAD dimer production was suppressed using Rh-PVP. This result indicates Rh-PVP acted as a catalyst for regioselective NAD+ reduction to NADH in the presence of TiO2. In addition, the selectivity of NADH in the presence of Rh-PVP was also higher compared with that in the absence of Rh-PVP. Compared with Rh-PVP and [Cp*Rh(bpy)(H2O)]2+, there was no difference in the selectivity for NADH production.
From these results, Rh-PVP can be considered a highly efficient homogeneous colloidal catalyst for selective NADH regeneration. We reported the suggested mechanism of selective 1,4-NADH production in a system consisting of TEOA, ZnTPPS and Rh-PVP.73 In this mechanism, it is speculated that NAD+ needs to interact with the surface of Rh nanoparticles as shown in Fig. 10 as one of the important processes for the selective production of 1,4-NADH. Here, the interaction of the carbonyl moiety of the amide group of NAD+ with Rh greatly contributes to the selective formation of NADH.

Irradiation wavelength dependence of NADH regeneration with the system of TEOA, ZnTPPS and Rh-PVP
The sample solution consisted of TEOA (200 mM), ZnTPPS (4.6 μM), Rh-PVP (50 μM), and NAD+ (1.0 mM). NADH regeneration was performed under monochromatic irradiation at 400, 420, 560, and 600 nm as shown in Fig. 11. The amount of NADH produced depended on the wavelength of irradiated light. The apparent quantum efficiencies for NADH regeneration at the irradiation wavelength of 400, 420, 560, and 600 nm were estimated to be 0.00016, 0.0012, 0.00016, and 0.00017%, respectively. On the other hand, no NADH regeneration was observed at the irradiation wavelength of 500 and 700 nm, because ZnTPPS has no absorption band in these regions. Therefore, it is indicated that photons absorbed in the Soret and Q bands of ZnTPPS are used in the NADH regeneration system.

Interaction between ZnTPPS and Rh-PVP and influence of oxygen on the photoredox system
UV-Vis absorption spectral changes of ZnTPPS (1.0 μM) with the addition of Rh-PVP (0–50 μM) are shown in Fig. 12. The absorbance maximum of ZnTPPS at 422 nm decreased and shifted to the longer wavelength side by adding Rh-PVP as shown in Fig. 12. This result indicates that ZnTPPS interacted with Rh-PVP and formed a complex. On the other hand, the quenching behavior pf ZnTPPS with Rh-PVP or NAD+ has been reported previously.73 The fluorescence spectra of ZnTPPS in the presence of Rh-PVP (250 μM) or NAD+ (1.25 mM) are shown in Fig. S5.† The fluorescence maximum of ZnTPPS at 606 nm and 656 nm decreased by adding Rh-PVP. On the other hand, no fluorescence quenching by NAD+ was observed as shown in Fig. S5.† This means that electron transfer from the excited singlet state of ZnTPPS to the electron acceptor or catalyst did not proceed. Therefore, we presumed that the electron transfer from the photoexcited triplet state of ZnTPPS (3ZnTPPS*) to Rh-PVP proceeded.
 Fig. 12  UV-Vis absorption spectral changes of ZnTPPS with addition of Rh-PVP. The sample solution contained ZnTPPS (1.0 μM) and Rh-PVP in HEPES–NaOH buffer (pH 7.4). 
In addition, the reaction was also performed without deaeration in the presence of Rh-PVP. The absorption band with the maximum around 340 nm also increased in the presence of oxygen. When the reaction was performed without deaeration treatment in the presence of Rh-PVP, the absorption at 300–380 nm was nearly unchanged before adding LDH and pyruvate. By photosensitization of ZnTPPS, NAD+ was reduced to NAD radicals and these radicals immediately coupled with each other to form NAD dimers. Thus, NADH regeneration did not proceed in the presence of oxygen, and deaeration treatment is essential for the development of the system with ZnTPPS and Rh-PVP.
Visible-light-driven pyruvate reduction to L-lactate with the system of TEOA, ZnTPPS, Rh-PVP, NAD+ and LDH

Scheme 2 shows visible-light-driven pyruvate reduction to L-lactate with LDH using an NADH regeneration system consisting of TEOA, ZnTPPS, Rh-PVP, NAD+, and pyruvate.
 Scheme 2  Visible-light-driven pyruvate reduction to L-lactate using a NADH regeneration system consisting of TEOA, ZnTPPS, Rh-PVP, NAD, LDH and pyruvate. 
The sample solution consisting of TEOA, ZnTPPS, Rh-PVP, NAD+, LDH, and pyruvate in HEPES–NaOH buffer (pH 7.4) was irradiated with visible light at 30 °C, and L-lactate was produced as shown in Fig. 13. The concentration of L-lactate produced was estimated to be 94 μM after 7 h of irradiation, and the conversion yield of pyruvate to L-lactate after 7 h irradiation was calculated to be 4.7%. In this system, the TOF and TON of the Rh atoms on the surface of Rh-PVP after 7 h of irradiation were estimated to be 2.0 h−1 and 14.0, respectively. The TOF and TON of ZnTPPS after 7 h of irradiation were estimated to be 4.1 h−1 and 20, respectively. Thus, the catalytic production of L-lactate proceeded using the visible-light-driven NADH regeneration system combined with LDH. In the absence of NAD+ and LDH, on the other hand, no L-lactate production was observed. When the sample solution consisting of TEOA, Rh-PVP, NAD+, LDH and pyruvate was irradiated without ZnTPPS, no L-lactate was produced, while the UV-Vis absorption band at 300–380 nm increased with the system without Rh-PVP, and no L-lactate was produced. When the sample solution containing TEOA, ZnTPPS, Rh-PVP, NAD+, LDH, and pyruvate in the HEPES–NaOH buffer (pH 7.4) was allowed to react under dark conditions, the intensity of the absorption band at 300–380 nm did not increase, and L-lactate was not produced.

Lactate is a chiral compound, one is L-lactate and the other is D-lactate. The chirality of the lactate synthesized from pyruvate using the system of TEOA, ZnTPPS, Rh-PVP, NAD+, and LDH with visible-light-irradiation was determined. A chart showing the HPLC data acquired for the sample solution is shown in Fig. 14(a). The chromatogram of the standard sample of DL-lactate is also shown in Fig. 14(b). In the chromatogram, the signal peaks attributed to L- and D-lactate are found at retention times of 5.5 and 6.8 min, respectively. After irradiation, the signal peak based on L-lactate was detected and it increased with irradiation time (Fig. 14(a)). On the other hand, no signal peak of D-lactate was detected.

Therefore, the enantioselective synthesis of L-lactate from pyruvate has been successfully achieved using the visible-light-driven NADH regeneration system of TEOA, ZnTPPS and Rh-PVP in the presence of LDH.
Visible-light-driven acetoacetate reduction to D-3-hydroxybutyrate with the system of TEOA, ZnTPPS, Rh-PVP, NAD+ and HBDH

Scheme 3 shows visible-light-driven acetoacetate reduction to 3-hydroxybutyrate with HBDH using an NADH regeneration system consisting of TEOA, ZnTPPS, Rh-PVP, NAD+, and acetoacetate.
 Scheme 3  Visible-light-driven acetoacetate reduction to D-3-hydroxybutyrate using a NADH regeneration system consisting of TEOA, ZnTPPS, Rh-PVP, NAD+, HBDH and acetoacetate. 
When the sample solution was irradiated with visible light at 30 °C, D-3-hydroxybutyrate was produced as shown in Fig. 15. The concentration of D-3-hydroxybutyrate produced was estimated to be 42 μM after 5 h of irradiation, and the conversion yield of acetoacetate to D-3-hydroxybutyrate after 4 h of irradiation was calculated to be 42%.
 Fig. 15  Time course of D-3-hydroxybutyrate production with the system of TEOA, ZnTPPS, Rh-PVP, NAD+, HBDH, and acetoacetate in HEPES–NaOH buffer under continuous irradiation. 
In this system, the TOF and TON of the Rh atoms on the surface of Rh-PVP after 5 h of irradiation were estimated to be 1.3 h−1 and 6.3, respectively. The TOF and TON of ZnTPPS after 5 h of irradiation were estimated to be 1.8 h−1 and 9.1, respectively. Even in this system, no D-3-hydroxybutyrate was produced under the condition of missing any one of TEOA, ZnTPPS, Rh-PVP, NAD+, acetoacetate and HBDH. Furthermore, no D-3-hydroxybutyrate was produced under dark conditions in this system.
Visible-light-driven malate production from pyruvate and CO2 with the system of TEOA, ZnTPPS, Rh-PVP, NAD+ and MDH
As an example of CO2 fixation to organic molecules based on C–C bond formation from CO2 as a C1 feedstock, L-malate production from pyruvate and CO2 was attempted using the visible-light-driven NADH regeneration system in the presence of MDH. Scheme 4 shows visible-light-driven malate production from pyruvate and CO2 with MDH using an NADH regeneration system consisting of TEOA, ZnTPPS, Rh-PVP, NAD+, MDH, pyruvate, HCO3− as a CO2 source, and Mg2+ as a cofactor for MDH.87
 Scheme 4  Visible-light-driven malate production using a NADH regeneration system consisting of TEOA, ZnTPPS, Rh-PVP, NAD+, MDH, pyruvate and CO2. 
When a sample in HEPES–NaOH buffer (pH 7.4) was irradiated with visible light at 30 °C, malate was produced as shown in Fig. 16. The concentration of malate produced was estimated to be 18 μM after 5 h irradiation.
 Fig. 16  Time course of L-malate production with the system of TEOA, ZnTPPS, Rh-PVP, NAD+, MDH, Mg2+, pyruvate and CO2 in HEPES–NaOH buffer under continuous irradiation. 
In this system, the TOF and TON of the Rh atoms on the surface of Rh-PVP after 5 h irradiation were estimated to be 0.53 h−1 and 2.7, respectively, and those for ZnTPPS after 5 h irradiation were estimated to be 0.78 h−1 and 3.6, respectively. Even in this system, no malate was produced under the condition of missing any one of TEOA, ZnTPPS, Rh-PVP, NAD+, pyruvate, HCO3−, Mg2+ and MDH. Furthermore, no malate was produced under dark conditions in this system. Therefore, CO2 fixation to organic molecules based on C–C bond formation to produce malate from CO2 and pyruvate has been successfully achieved using the NADH regeneration system of TEOA, ZnTPPS, Rh-PVP in the presence of MDH. An example of visible-light-driven CO2 reduction to formate or methanol by using the NADH regeneration system with the Rh complex in the presence of formate, aldehyde and alcohol dehydrogenases has been reported.39,48 However, this system involves reduction of CO2 to a C1 compound, not a CO2 fixation technique. On the other hand, our system achieved CO2 fixation to pyruvate as a carboxy group by using the NADH regeneration system in the presence of MDH. From the results, it is found that although the efficiency of malate production is still low, this is the first report of a combination of visible-light-driven NADH regeneration and MDH for CO2 fixation. Further, in the above-mentioned visible-light-driven lactate or D-3-hydroxybutyrate production system, the amount of added LDH (20.0 units) or HBDH (8.5 units) is estimated to be about 12 to 29 times the amount of MDH (0.7 unit) in this CO2 fixation system. The concentration of lactate or D-3-hydroxybutyrate was estimated to be 70 and 42 μM after 300 min irradiation, respectively. On the other hand, the concentration of malate was estimated to be 18 μM after 300 min irradiation. From these results, it is predicted that MDH functions more efficiently as a catalyst than LDH or HBDH. Thus, it is expected that the efficiency of malate production will be improved by optimizing the amount of MDH in the future.
Conclusions
This study was devoted to achieving visible-light-driven molecular conversion using the NADH regeneration system of TEOA, ZnTPPS, colloidal Rh-PVP and NAD+ in the presence of various dehydrogenases. The irradiation wavelength dependence of NADH regeneration using the system of TEOA, ZnTPPS, colloidal Rh-PVP and NAD+ was studied and the quantum efficiency for NADH regeneration at 420 nm due to the Soret band of ZnTPPS was determined to be at least 0.0012%. The catalytic activity of Rh-PVP was compared with that of [Cp*Rh(bpy)(H2O)]2+ for NADH regeneration using TEOA and ZnTPPS, and Rh-PVP realized 85% of the initial performance of [Cp*Rh(bpy)(H2O)]2+. It was also shown that the catalytic activity of Rh-PVP on the surface of nanoparticles at the number of Rh atoms is higher than that of [Cp*Rh(bpy)(H2O)]2+. The visible-light-driven NADH regeneration system was also applied to enzyme-catalyzed redox reactions for molecular conversions. The visible-light-driven enantioselective synthesis of L-lactate or D-3-hydroxybutyrate with the NADH regeneration system of TEOA, ZnTPPS, Rh-PVP and NAD+ in the presence of LDH or HBDH has been successfully achieved. Moreover, visible-light-driven C–C bond formation between pyruvate and CO2 to produce L-malate was also successfully achieved using the NADH regeneration system of TEOA, ZnTPPS, Rh-PVP and NAD+ in the presence of MDH. These results not only indicate an example of colloidal Rh nanoparticles used as a catalyst for selective NADH regeneration but also visible-light induced selective production of chemicals/solar fuels directly from CO2.
