    , Accepted 30th January 2022First published on 31st January 2022AbstractAiming to design bipolar organic semiconductors with high electron mobility and efficient red thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), three donor–acceptor compounds were designed and synthesized selecting 1,8-naphthalimide as an acceptor and phenoxazine, 3,7-di-tert-butylphenothiazine or 2,7-di-tert-butyldimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine as donor moieties. Aggregation induced emission enhancement was detected for the compounds causing efficient TADF in the solid-state. Photoluminescence quantum yields up to 77% were observed for the films of the compounds doped in a host. The compounds exhibited small singlet–triplet splitting (0.03–0.05 eV), and high reverse intersystem crossing rates of 2.08 × 105–1.13 × 106 s−1. The compounds were characterized by satisfactory hole and electron-injecting properties with ionization potentials of 5.72–5.83 eV and electron affinities of 2.79–2.91 eV. Bipolar charge transport was revealed by time of flight measurements. Electron transport with low dispersity and mobilities exceeding 2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 was observed at an electric field of 4.6 × 105 V cm−1. The compounds were used as emitters in red electroluminescent devices, which showed maximum external quantum efficiencies up to 8.2%. Utilization of host–guest systems as light-emitting materials with hosts preferably transporting holes and TADF guests which preferably transport electrons allowed maximum efficiencies to be achieved at a practical brightness of 700–2200 cd m−2. DFT calculations of the geometry, electronic structure, absorption and photoluminescence spectra of all compounds were carried out to prove the conclusions drawn from the experiment. The results of the calculations clearly show that the first excited state for all compounds is the intramolecular charge transfer state. Quantitative analysis of the separation degree of electronic density during excitation allows the observed dependence of the blue shift value in the absorption and emission spectra on the increasing polarity of the solvent to be explained.
1. Introduction
Organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) are the key parts of modern display and illumination devices in the market since they comply with requirements of commercialisation such as driving voltage, efficiency, operation life-time, and colour quality.1–3 The most important functional material of OLEDs is the emitter for which harvesting of all electrically generated excitons (in ratio 1 to 3 for singlet and triplet excitons, respectively) in the light-emitting layer with the following conversion into photons (radiative recombination) is essential.4,5 Triplets are typically non-emissive for most of the organic fluorescent emitters limiting the theoretical internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of fluorescent OLEDs at the level of 25%.6 This limit of fluorescent OLEDs can be overcome using donor–acceptor type emitters exhibiting thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) which allows an IQE of 100% to be reached.7,8 The appropriate design of donor–acceptor type compounds may lead to small singlet–triplet energy splitting (ΔEST) assisting efficient harvesting of triplet excitons via thermally boosted reverse intersystem crossing (RISC).9 The OLEDs exhibiting electroluminescence (EL) of different energy with 20% or higher external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) were developed without the utilization of phosphorescent emitters based on rare-earth metals suffering from complicated synthesis, high cost or environmental problems.10–12 Typically, light-emitting layers of state-of-the-art TADF based OLEDs are based on host–guest systems allowing the aggregation caused quenching and charge-transporting issues of the materials with twisted donor–acceptor molecular structures to be solved.13,14 However, such OLEDs still suffer from high efficiency roll-offs apparently caused by predominating hole transport of both the host and guest materials within the light-emitting layers. In this work, we aimed to develop TADF emitters with high electron mobilities. It is shown that roll-off OLED efficiency issues can be fixed by utilization of host–guest systems based on a host with preferable hole transport and a TADF guest with preferable electron transport.
With the above purpose, three new compounds 1–3 (Scheme 1) were synthesised substituting the 1,8-naphthalimide acceptor moiety with different donors such as 10H-phenoxazine, 3,7-di-tert-butyl-10H-phenothiazine or 2,7-di-tert-butyl-9,9-dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine (Scheme 1). The selection of an electron deficient 1,8-naphthalimide moiety was based on the combination of good electron-transporting properties and satisfactory hole/electron injecting properties.15–17 The previously reported 1,8-naphthalimide derivatives found applications in different optoelectronic devices (e.g. OLEDs, solar cells, electrochromic switches, or memory devices) due to their good charge-transporting and charge injecting properties.18–22 In addition, aggregation induced emission enhancement (AIEE), and thus highly efficient emission in the solid-state, can be achieved for 1,8-naphthalimide derivatives.23–27 In fact, 1,8-naphthalimide derivatives are good candidates as emitters for optoelectronic devices due to their high photoluminescence quantum yields and tunable emission colours.28 Typically, naphthalimide derivatives are characterized by high electron affinity, which can be effectively tuned by different donor substitutions.10 In such a case, intramolecular donor–acceptor interactions may lead to the formation of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) excited states and induce TADF.

In this work, the selection of the acceptor and donors was successfully performed. An experimental study was carried out in combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the ground state and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) for the excited states. The synthesized compounds showed the set of required properties, such as red TADF, AIEE, and high electron mobility reaching 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 at high electric fields. The synthesized red emitters demonstrated high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields of 18–77% in the solid-state. It is difficult to get high PL quantum yields of red-emitting organic luminophores since the rate of nonradiative decay is inversely related to the energy difference between the ground and excited states and since the radiative rate has a cubic dependence of the radiative rate on the transition energy.18,29,30 As a result, OLEDs with maximum external quantum efficiencies up to 8.2% at a practical brightness of 700–2200 cd m−2 were obtained, thus demonstrating the potential of host–guest systems based on the host preferably transporting holes and the TADF guest preferably transporting electrons.

Infrared (IR), melting points, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements and other experiments were carried out as described in the ESI† or earlier.31
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and characterization
As shown in Scheme 1, compounds 1–3 were synthesized by Buchwald–Hartwig cross coupling reactions of 4-bromo-N-(2-ethylhexyl)-1,8-naphthalimide (IMBr) with 10H-phenoxazine, 3,7-di-tert-butyl-10H-phenothiazine and 2,7-di-tert-butyl-9,9-dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine, respectively. IMBr, 3,7-di-tert-butyl-10H-phenothiazine and 2,7-di-tert-butyl-9,9-dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine were prepared according to the reported procedures.32,33 All the compounds were fully characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, IR spectroscopies, and mass spectrometry, as well as by elemental analysis. Synthetic procedures and characterization data for 1–3 can be found in the ESI,† Fig. S1–S3.
3.2 Theoretical calculations
In order to understand the electronic structures of compounds 1–3 in the ground and excited states, DFT calculations were performed at the wB97XD/6-31+G(d) level of theory.34 The calculations were carried out in solutions of toluene and THF. Solvation effects were considered using the SMD model35 in terms of the Linear Response scheme.36 Previously we have shown that the mentioned level of theory allows the electronic structure of BODIPY dyes in the ground and excited states to be accurately reproduced.37 In the case of calculations of the absorption spectra, the geometry of the ground states S0 of compounds 1–3 was fully optimized in solution within the DFT approach with subsequent calculation of the spectra within TD-DFT. For the calculations of photoluminescence spectra, the geometry of the first singlet S1 or first triplet T1 excited state was fully optimized in solution within TD-DFT. The values of singlet–triplet splitting (ΔEST) were estimated as a difference between E(S1 → S0) and E(T1 → S0) in the calculated photoluminescence spectra. All of the calculations were carried out using the Gaussian 16 program.38 The analysis of electron density was performed using Multiwfn software.39
For compounds 1–3, the calculated wavelengths corresponding to the first (λICTABS) and the second (λLEABS) absorption maxima, wavelengths corresponding to the transitions S1 → S0 in the photoluminescence spectra (λICTPL), oscillator strengths (f), values of singlet–triplet splitting (ΔEST), dipole moment variation caused by electron excitation (Δμ), separation degree of positive (ρ+) and negative (ρ−) parts of electron density (τ-indexes) and overlaps between functions C+ and C−39 (S+−-indexes) are given in Table 1.

The electron density difference (Δρ) between the S1 and S0 states and S0 → S1 charge transfer (CT) calculated for compounds 1–3 are visualized in Fig. 1, whereas Δρ between the S2 and S0 states and S0 → S2 CT are visualized in Fig. 2. The plots of the molecular orbitals and values of largest coefficients in the CI expansion for S0 → S1 and S0 → S2 excitation calculated for compounds 1–3 are given in Fig. 3.

Despite the wB97XD functional providing accurate reproduction of the absorption spectra in terms of both intensity and the relative peak position,40,41 this functional significantly underestimates the wavelengths of absorption maxima.37,40,41 Therefore, for comparison of our calculated positions of the first and second absorption maxima with the experimental ones, we scaled the calculated results using the correlation equation from our previous paper:35λABS(scaled) = 1.062·λABS(calc.) + 52.96, nm. The scaled values of wavelengths corresponding to the first maxima in the absorption spectra of compounds 1–3 (Table 1) are in very good agreement with the experimental data (see Table 2). As it can be seen from Fig. 1, the first maxima in the absorption spectra (S0 → S1 transitions) of compounds 1–3 can be attributed to the ICT states formed between the electron-donating moieties and electron-accepting 1,8-naphthalimide. It is also confirmed by the data of Table 1. Thus, the S0 → S1 excitation for all considered compounds is accompanied by a very large variation of the dipole moment (more than 17 Debye) and it corresponds to a positive value of the τ-index (with exception of compound 3 in toluene solution). It should be noted that a larger positive τ-index value means a larger separation degree of ρ+ and ρ− and therefore a larger CT. If the value of τ-index is much less than zero, it implies that ρ+ and ρ− are not substantially separated due to excitation. According to the data of Table 1, the largest separation of electronic density corresponds to S0 → S1 excitation of compound 1 and the smallest separation corresponds to compound 3. It is in agreement with the calculated and the experimentally observed values of hypsochromic shifts in the row of compounds 1–3 with increasing solvent polarity (compare the λICTABS values in toluene (ε = 2.3741) and THF (ε = 7.4257) given in Tables 1 and 2). Thus, the lowest value of hypsochromic shift corresponds to compound 3 and the largest one to compound 1. The calculated overlaps between functions C+ and C− (S+−-indexes) are significantly less than 1, which means that these functions are substantially separated. Therefore, S0 → S1 excitation is characterized by very low values of the oscillator strength f (Table 1). In the case of compound 3, the slightly larger value of S+−-index corresponds to slightly larger f. The largest coefficients in the CI expansion for S0 → S1 excitation correspond to HOMO → LUMO transitions for all compounds (see Fig. 3). That is, the S1 state mainly results from the HOMO → LUMO excitation, which implies an electron transfer from phenoxazine, 3,7-di-tert-butylphenothiazine or 2,7-di-tert-butyldimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine as donors, where the HOMO is localized, to the 1,8-naphthalimide as an acceptor, where the LUMO resides (Fig. 3).

The second maxima in the absorption spectra (S0 → S2 transitions) of compounds 1–3 can be attributed to the π–π* local excitation (LE) of the 1,8-naphthalimide moiety (see Fig. 2 and 3). In contrast to the previously considered S0 → S1 excitation, the S0 → S2 transition is not accompanied by a significant change in the dipole moment, and it corresponds to a large negative value of the τ-index for all compounds (see Table 1). The calculated values of S+−-index are close to 1, which means that the C+ and C− functions are strongly overlapped. Therefore, S0 → S1 excitation is characterized by large values of the oscillator strength (Table 1). The largest coefficients in the CI expansion for S0 → S2 excitation correspond to HOMO−2 → LUMO (compounds 1 and 2) or HOMO−1 → LUMO (compound 3) transitions (Fig. 3). That is, the S2 state mainly results from π–π* local excitation of the 1,8-naphthalimide moiety. The slight difference in absorption of the compounds 2 and 3, in comparison with compound 1, is caused by more contribution in their HOMO−2 or HOMO−1 of the corresponding donors (Fig. 3).
Taking into account that the wB97WD functional significantly underestimates the wavelengths of absorption and emission maxima, the calculated values of λICTPL for compounds 1–3 in toluene (Table 1) are in reasonable agreement with the experimental ones (Table 2). That is, the largest value of λICTPL both in the experimental and in the calculated emission spectra corresponds to compound 2 and the lowest one corresponds to compound 3. The hypsochromic shift observed in the PL spectra for compounds 1 and 2 with increasing polarity of the solvent (see Table 2) is also in agreement with the results of the calculations (Table 1). According to the experimental data, the PL spectrum of compound 3 is almost unshifted with a change in the polarity of the solvent (Table 2). This result is also in agreement with the calculated values for compound 3λICTABS in toluene and THF, as well as with the lowest value of τ-index of compound 3 among all considered compounds. The values of singlet–triplet energy splitting (ΔEST) calculated for compounds 1–3 are very small (Table 1), which is also in agreement with the experimental data (see Table 2).
3.3 Thermal properties
Thermal properties of compounds 1–3 were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) under a nitrogen atmosphere. From the TGA curves, 5% weight loss temperatures (TID) higher than 370 °C were obtained showing that the compounds can be used for device fabrications by thermal processes (Fig. 4a and Table 2). Apparently because of the similar molecular weights of compounds 1–3, they demonstrated similar TGA trends with practically the same TID temperatures.
 Fig. 4  TGA curves of 1–3 (a) and DSC thermograms of 1 (b). 
Compounds 1–3 were obtained as crystalline substances after the synthesis and purification. The solid sample of 2 melted at 176 °C during the first DSC heating scan (Fig. S4 (ESI†) and Table 2). Derivatives 1 and 3 were characterized by similar melting point Tm values (Fig. 4b and Fig. S4, ESI†). During the second scan, glass transition was detected for compound 2 at 47 °C. Compounds 1 and 3 exhibited considerably higher glass transition temperatures (Tg) of 76 and 83 °C, respectively.
3.4 Photophysical properties
Absorption bands in two spectral regions, high-energy (at wavelengths up to ca. 370 nm) and low-energy (at wavelengths from ca. 370 to 600 nm) ones, were observed in the absorption spectra of toluene and THF solutions of compounds 1–3 (Fig. 5a). Similar absorption properties were observed for the solid films of 1–3 (Fig. 5b). The absorption in the high-energy region is caused by π–π* transitions of the local excited (LE) state formed mainly by the 1,8-naphthalimide moiety.42 As noted above (see Section 3.2), the slight differences in absorption of the compounds 1–3 are caused by the contribution to the LE states of the corresponding donors. The absorption in the low-energy region can be attributed to the ICT states formed between the electron-donating moieties and electron-accepting 1,8-naphthalimide (see Section 3.2). Typically, ICT manifests as a single broad absorption band in the low-energy region.43,44 The ICT bands of the compounds were located at ca. 500 nm, which can be attributed to the strong HOMO–LUMO separation required for TADF.45 The absorption bands of the compounds exhibit negative solvatochomism (Fig. 5a) as the polarity of the solvents affects the energy levels of the excited states S1 and S2. A bigger blue shift of ca. 10 nm was observed for the low-energy band than for the short-wavelength band of absorption. This is additional evidence of the distinctive ICT nature of the S1 band in contrast to the LE state of S2.

PL decay curves (e) of the non-doped/doped films of 1–3. Excitation wavelengths are 350 nm for the PL spectra and 374 nm for the PL decay curves. 
The PL spectra of 1–3 in low-polarity toluene were characterized by broad bands peaking at 686, 751, and 650 nm, respectively (Fig. 5a). The red emission resulted from radiative recombination of optically excited ICT excitons of 1–3 (see Section 3.2). The bathochromic shift of emission spectrum of 2 is apparently determined by the stronger donor attached.46 PL spectra of the solid samples of 1–3 had maxima at 658, 638, and 646 nm, respectively. Hypsochromically shifted PL spectra relative to those of the films of the net compounds were recorded for 10 wt% solid solutions of 1–3 in 1,3-bis(N-carbazolyl)benzene (mCP) (Fig. 5b). These experimental data manifest the sensitivity of the ICT states to the media polarity similar to the blue-shift of the emission of the solution caused by the polarity of THF (Fig. 5a) as discussed above in Section 3.2.
The photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of toluene/THF solutions of 1–3 were found to be lower than 3% (Table 2). It should be taken into account that these values were obtained in air and the PL intensity was considerably quenched by oxygen (Fig. S5, ESI†). Considerably higher PLQY values were observed for the solid samples of 1–3 especially for the films of the compounds doped in a host (up to 77%). The increase of efficiency of emission in the solid state can be attributed to AIEE.47 To study this effect in more detail, PL spectra of compounds 1–3 dispersed in THF/water mixtures with different water fractions were recorded (Fig. 5c and Fig. S6, ESI†). When water was added to the THF solution, the PL intensity of 1–3 decreased due to the high polarity of water, which induced non-radiative deactivation of ICT states of the compounds.48 At high enough water fractions for the formation of aggregates, the PL intensities increased, which is the evidence of AIEE.472 exhibits the most pronounced AIEE property of the series. As it was shown before, the phenothiazine-based compound can be characterized by a blue shift of the emission spectra in the solid state when compared to solutions due to the effects of aggregation, arguably caused by phenothiazine-driven aggregation-caused suppression of ICT states in neat and doped films.46,49
Since the films of compounds 1–3 demonstrated high PLQYs, their emission nature in the solid-state was further investigated. PL decay curves of the films of 1–3 were recorded in a vacuum of <10−4 Barr (Fig. 5e). The PL decay curves of the films of the compounds were characterized by the fast and slow components related to prompt and delayed fluorescence. The absence of differences in the shapes of the PL spectra before and after deoxygenation proves that the long-lived emission of compounds 1–3 is delayed fluorescence (Fig. S7, ESI†). The enhanced intensities of delay fluorescence of the films of 1–3 doped in mCP are in good agreement with the enhanced PLQY values of the films of the compounds doped in mCP relative to those of the films of the pure compounds (Table 2).
To check whether the delayed fluorescence is sensitive to temperature, PL decay cures of the films of compounds 1–3 were recorded at different temperatures in an inert atmosphere (Fig. 6a). The intensity of delayed fluorescence increased with the increase of temperature from 77 to 300 K. This observation can be attributed to the TADF nature of the emission of compounds 1–3. This is in very good agreement with the small singlet–triplet splittings of 0.03–0.05 eV, which are typical for TADF emitters (Fig. 6b). In addition, the slopes of unity of the plots of delayed emission intensity versus excitation power allow the triplet–triplet annihilation emission nature of the long lived fluorescence of compounds 1–3 to be excluded (Fig. 6c and Fig. S8, ESI†).51,52

To get more information on the TADF properties of differently substituted napthalimides (1–3), PL decay curves of the films of 10 wt% solid solutions in mCP were recorded and fitted by the exponential law in nanosecond and microsecond ranges to get life-times of prompt (τPF) and delayed (τDF) fluorescence, respectively. The results of fitting of the PL decay curves are summarized in Table 2. Using the fitting results, the radiation transition rates (i.e. rate constants of prompt (kPF) and delayed (kDF) components as well as rate constants of intersystem crossing (kISC) and RISC (kRISC) were estimated (Table 2). The yields of prompt (ηPF) fluorescence and delayed fluorescence (ηDF) were extracted from the total PLQY by comparison of the integrated intensities of the prompt and delayed components. The TADF efficiencies of compounds 1–3 can be represented by their rate constants kRISC, the highest value of which (1.13 × 106 s−1) was obtained for compound 3 (Table 2). The lowest kRISC of 2.08 × 105 s−1 is for 2 confirming the suggestion made previously46,49 of phenothiazine causing ICT suppression in the solid mixture of 2 and a host. This kRISC value of 3 is, however, among the best for state-of-the-art TADF emitters, displaying the potential of the synthesized compounds (especially of compound 3) for practical applications.53,54
3.5 Energy levels
Ultraviolet photoelectron and inverse photoemission spectroscopies are required for estimation of ionization potentials (IPPE) and electron affinities (EAPE), respectively, of new organic semiconductors in the solid-state for the design of optoelectronic devices based on them.55,56 Photoelectron emission spectra of vacuum-deposited films of 1–3 on a glass substrate with a fluorine-doped tin oxide electrode were recorded in air (Fig. 7). Higher IPPE values (5.72–5.83 eV) were obtained for the films of 1–3 (Table 3). Since the inverse photoemission spectroscopy measurements were not possible at our laboratories, EAPE values of the films were calculated by the formula EAPE = IPPE − 1.37 × Eoptg according to the procedure described elsewhere56 (Table 3). The obtained EAPE values are appropriate for efficient electron injection from the typical LiF/Al OLED cathode.57

3.6 Charge transporting properties
To investigate the charge-transporting properties of 1–3 in sandwich-like structures ITO/thermo-vacuum deposited layer/Al, the time-of-flight (ToF) method was exploited over a large range of electric fields (ca. 4 × 10−4–4 × 10−5 V cm−1) as shown in Fig. 8a. Under the negative voltage (V) of −80 V applied to the ITO electrode through which the layer of 1 with the thicknesses (d) of 2.6 μm was excited by a laser beam (355 nm), ToF current transients were recorded. Transit times (ttr) for electrons were well observed in the linear plots (Fig. 8b). Such shapes of the ToF current transients can be attributed to the low-dispersity of electron transport in the layer of 1. When the polarity of the applied voltage was switched to 80 V at ITO, the ToF current transient for holes was recorded. It showed more dispersive character of hole-transport in comparison to that of electrons observed at the same electric field (Fig. 8c). From the ToF current transient plotted in linear scales, the ttr value for holes at 80 V was practically not possible to obtain. To calculate electron (μe) and hole (μh) mobilities at different electric fields using formula μ(h,e) = d2/t × V, the ttr values were taken from the ToF current transients plotted on double logarithmic scales (Fig. S9, ESI†). Comparison of the ttr values observed for electrons and holes of 0.26 and 2.8 μs, respectively, clearly shows that at the voltage of 80 V electrons can drift much faster across the 2.6 μm layer of 1. As a result, much higher μe of 3.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 than μh of 3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained for compound 1 at the external voltage of ±80 V (electric field of 3.1 × 105 V cm−1) (Fig. 8a). For compounds 2 and 3, similar trends in ToF current transients as well as in electron and hole mobility values were observed (Fig. 8 and Fig. S9, ESI†). Thus, compounds 1–3 demonstrated high electron mobilities reaching 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 at high electric fields and one order of magnitude lower hole mobilities reaching 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 at the same electric fields.
 Fig. 8  Poole–Frenkel-type electric field dependences of hole and electron mobilities (a) in 1–3-based sandwich structures obtained by the TOF method and examples of TOF transients for electrons (b) and holes (c) observed for the film of compound 1 at different applied voltages/electric fields. 
To identify the effect of the nature of donor substituents attached to the 1,8-naphthalimide moiety on the charge-transporting properties of compounds 1–3, their hole and electron mobilities were compared by plotting the Poole–Frenkel dependences at different electric fields (E) described by the formula μ(h,e) = μ0(h,e) × exp(β(h,e) × E0.5) (1) (Fig. 8a). In the formula (1), μ0(h,e) is zero-field mobility and β(h,e) is the electric field dependence parameter for holes or electrons. Electron mobilities μe observed for compounds 1–3 were in the narrow range of ca. 2.1 × 10−3–4.5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 at the same electric field of 4.6 × 105 V cm−1 due to the same electron-accepting 1,8-naphthalimide moiety being present in the molecular structures of 1–3 (Table 3). When extrapolations of fitting curves of experimental mobilities by formula (1) crossed the axis Y at zero electric fields, zero-field mobilities μ0e in the range of 1.3 × 10−4–3.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 were obtained for compounds 1–3. Small differences between μe and μ0e values of 1–3 can be attributed to the peculiarities of molecular packing in vacuum deposited films 1–3. In addition, the similar βe values of 3.85 × 10−3–4.35 × 10−3 (cm V−1)0.5 were obtained for compounds 1–3 from the slopes of the fitting plots. These values of βe were smaller than the corresponding values for holes of βh of 6 × 10−3–6.25 × 10−3 (cm V−1)0.5 due to the lower dispersity of electron-transport in comparison to that of holes. In contrast to many previously published bipolar organic semiconductors,59,60 the phenoxazine, phenothiazine or acridan substituted 1,8-naphthalimides demonstrated lower hole mobilities than electron mobilities (Fig. 8a). The hole mobilities ranged from 7.55 × 10−5 to 7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 at an electric field of 4.6 × 105 V cm−1. Such charge-transporting properties of bipolar OLED functional materials were shown to be useful for getting low roll-off efficiencies of blue phosphorescent OLEDs.61 It should be mentioned that both the hole and electron mobilities of compound 2 were lower than those of 1 and 3 apparently because of the relatively bulky sulphur atom of phenothiazine leading to bigger intramolecular distances and less HOMO–HOMO and LUMO–LUMO overlapping between neighbouring molecules.
3.7 Electroluminescent characteristics
EL properties of compounds 1–3 were studied using the non-optimized device structure ITO / MoO3 (0.5 nm) / NPB (40 nm) / light-emitting layer (20 nm) / TSPO1 (6 nm) / TPBi (34 nm) / LiF (1 nm) / Al (80 nm). Compounds 1–3 (10 wt%) doped in mCP were used as light-emitting materials. Molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) was used for the hole-injection layer, N,N′-di(1-naphthyl)-N,N′-diphenyl-(1,1′-biphenyl)-4,4′-diamine (NPB) was used for the hole-transporting layer, diphenyl-4-triphenylsilyl-phenylphosphineoxide (TSPO1) was employed as a hole-blocking material, 2,2′,2′′-(1,3,5-benzinetriyl)-tris(1-phenyl-1-H-benzimidazole) (TPBi) was used as an electron-transporting material, and a layer of lithium fluoride (LiF) was used as an electron-injecting layer. According to the equilibrium energy diagram of the devices (Fig. 9a), holes and electrons can be transported from electrodes to light-emitting layers without high energy berries leading to relatively low turn on voltages (Von). The devices showed Von values in the range of 4.86–4.98 V (Fig. 9b). Because of the high energy barriers of 1.0 and 0.4 eV at the interface 1–3:mCP/TSPO1 for holes and at the interface NPB/1-3:mCP for electrons, respectively, the exciton formation and recombination zones were located within the light-emitting layers. As a result, orange-red EL with the 1931 CIE coordinates of (0.56, 0.36), (0.48, 0.49) and (0.59, 0.39) was observed for devices I–III, respectively (Fig. 9c and Table 4). Those EL colours were the same under the different applied voltages due to the stable EL spectra (Fig. 9d). The EL spectra of devices I–III were similar to the corresponding PL spectra of systems 1–3:mCP additionally proving that the EL is originated from compounds 1–3 (Fig. 5b and 9d).

The current (CE), power (PE) and external quantum (EQE) efficiencies obtained for the devices were in the order device III > device I > device II. Thus, the OLED containing compound 3 containing an acridan donor moiety was the most efficient (Fig. 9e and Table 4). Device III demonstrated maximum CE, PE and EQE of 13.21 cd A−1, 6.75 lm W−1 and 8.19%, respectively. It should be noted that the maximum efficiencies were reached at high brightness (L), which is favourable for practical use (Fig. 9e). These results can be attributed to the usage of host–guest systems 1–3:mCP. The mCP host is preferably a hole-transporting material62 while the TADF guests (1–3) are preferably electron-transporting compounds (Fig. 8a). As a result, charge-transport balance could be expected under broad electric field values causing low efficiency roll-offs (high efficiencies at practical brightness of 700–2200 cd m−2).
The theoretical maximum EQE can be estimated using the following equation:63EQE = PLQY·ηcharge capture·ηS–T·ηoutEQE is directly linked to the PLQY of the respective emitting layer. In the equation, ηcharge capture stands for efficiency of exciton formation, ηS–T is a measure of singlet and triplet exciton utilization, and ηout is an out-coupling factor of EL from the emissive surface of the OLED. Usually, the usage of isotropic emitters and non-advanced substrates results in ηout of ca. 20%63 manifesting the maximum EQE of 20% for delayed fluorescent materials and 5% for prompt fluorescent emitters. For the films of compounds 1–3 doped in the host, the maximum expected values of EQE of the corresponding OLEDs are 10.6, 3.6 and 15.4%, respectively. Although the obtained experimental values of EQE confirm the trend of PLQY observed for the investigated emitters, they are lower than the theoretical values. Similar observations were reported for other 1,8-naphthalimide derivatives (Table S1, ESI†). The reason for the efficiency drop may be attributed to the absence of the electron blocking layer affecting the charge balance and decreasing ηchargecapture. The minor consequence of that is the relatively high Von of ca. 5 V observed for all OLEDs fabricated in this work. Although the fabricated devices were not optimized, their characteristics are comparable with those of the previously reported OLEDs based on derivatives of 1,8-naphthalimide (Table S1, ESI†). It is also expected that bipolar compounds 1–3 with high electron mobilities can be promising hosts for infrared OLEDs.
4. Conclusions
Three derivatives of 1,8-naphthalimide with electron donating phenoxazine, phenothiazine or acridan substituents were synthesized. The geometries and electronic structures of all compounds were studied using DFT calculations. The calculated scaled absorption spectra are in good agreement with the experimental ones. The theoretical work revealed that the first maxima in the absorption spectra of compounds 1–3 are caused by ICT excitation, which implies an electron transfer from phenoxazine, 3,7-di-tert-butylphenothiazine or 2,7-di-tert-butyldimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine as donors to the 1,8-naphthalimide as an acceptor, whereas the second maxima in the absorption spectra are caused by π–π* local excitation of the 1,8-naphthalimide moiety. The calculated value of τ-index was found to be the lowest for compound 3. This result explains the experimentally observed fact that the solvent polarity has the least effect on the absorption and fluorescence spectra of this compound. The results of the calculations prove the conclusions drawn from the experimental data. The compounds were characterized by red TADF with high PLQY values in the solid state due to the AIEE. The effect of the substituents of 1,8-naphthalimide on the TADF efficiency of the compounds was investigated by time resolved and steady state luminescence spectroscopy. The different rates of RISC were observed. They increased in the order of 1.13 × 10−6 > 0.719 × 10−6 > 0.208 × 10−6 s−1 for the compounds containing 2,7-di-tert-butyl-9,9-dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine, 3,7-di-tert-butyl-10H-phenothiazine or 10H-phenoxazine moieties, respectively. Close ionization potentials of 5.72–5.83 eV and electron affinities of 2.79–2.91 eV were obtained for vacuum-deposited films of the compounds by photoelectron spectroscopy in air. High electron mobilities exceeding 2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and by ca. one order of magnitude lower hole mobilities were recorded for the compounds at an electric field of 4.6 × 105 V cm−1. The trend of maximum external quantum efficiency of the red EL devices followed the trend of TADF efficiencies of the developed emitters showing that acridan is the most efficient substituent in 1,8-naphthalimides designed for application in OLEDs. The 2,7-di-tert-butyl-9,9-dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine-substituted 1,8-naphthalimide showed competitive device parameters (maximum current (13.21 cd A−1), power (6.75 lm W−1) and external quantum (8.2%) efficiencies) for red electroluminescent devices without precise device optimizations and out-coupling.
