    , Accepted 27th January 2020First published on 27th January 2020AbstractAmorphous carbon nitrogen (a-CN) has attracted a lot of attention due to its unique properties, different from those of its crystal form. Here, we demonstrate a near-infrared (NIR) photothermal conversion assisted photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from a-CN with nitrogen vacancies (a-CNN) nanosheets. Experiments suggest that sp2 hybridized CC structures can be created in a-CNN. These structures, just like small islands, disperse on a-CNN, leading to fluorescence quenching and a superior vis-NIR light absorption. Meanwhile, these structures, like “hot islands”, can generate a stronger NIR photothermal conversion. A series of in situ characterization techniques are developed to clarify the detailed mechanism of photothermal conversion assisted photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. It is found that photothermal conversion can not only accelerate the drift velocity of the photo-induced carrier, but also increase the carrier concentration, which finally promotes the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Due to photothermal conversion assistance, the hydrogen production rate of a-CNN nanosheets is promoted to 3.1 mmol g−1 h−1 compared to 0.71 mmol g−1 h−1 for a-CN, in which the NIR photothermal conversion is proven to contribute a 16% promotion to the hydrogen production. These findings suggest that creating an NIR photothermal conversion of photocatalysts by constructing “hot islands” can greatly promote photocatalytic hydrogen production.
1. Introduction
Improving solar energy utilization efficiency is a major challenge for large-scale application of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (HER).1–3 Solar light is composed of ultraviolet (UV), visible (Vis), near-infrared (NIR) and infrared (IR) light, among which, about 95% of the total solar light that reaches the Earth’s surface is visible-NIR light.4–6 However, typically, most photocatalysis processes only can be excited by UV-Vis light due to photocatalysts' large band gap.7–9 Also, electron–hole pairs generated by photocatalysts must have enough energy that can be used for photocatalytic water splitting.10,11 Much attention has been paid to the extension of the absorption band edge to the visible light region.12–15 However, theoretically, the light absorption band edge should be less than 1000 nm because of the limitation of water decomposition voltage (1.23 eV) and reaction overpotential.16 Therefore, utilization of the NIR part of solar light has the significance to improve solar energy utilization efficiency.
Amorphous materials, different from crystals or quasi-crystals with long-range atomic order, have characteristic atomic arrangements of short-range order but long-range disorder. These features give them distinct electronic, optical, mechanical and magnetic properties. Amorphous carbon nitride has been reported to have a most remarkable advantage of a much smaller band gap than crystalline graphitic carbon nitride.17
Amorphous carbon nitride with C or N vacancies enables an impurity level, which gives them a wider light absorption range. Thus, it will harvest a larger portion of solar radiation, which is a prerequisite for achieving high-efficiency solar energy conversion. Recent representative examples include the use of amorphous black TiO2 for the photodegradation of organic pollutants under visible light reported by Teng et al.,18 and disordered Co1.28Mn1.71O4 as a visible-light-responsive photocatalyst for HER by Chen et al.19 These vacancies not only can enhance the catalytic performance, but also promote amorphous carbon nitrogen’s (a-CN’s) photothermal conversion efficiency.
Generally, the fast migration of photo-induced carriers in a photocatalyst can decrease its recombination and then result in a high HER rate. The proper promotion of the photocatalytic reaction temperature can accelerate the drift velocity of photo-induced carriers, which can further fortify the HER rate partly.20 Wang et al.21 reported that the photocatalytic water splitting rate was enhanced monotonically with increasing the reaction temperature from 279 to 318 K. They considered that the thermal excitation is necessary for electron transfer across the Schottky barrier at the BiVO4:Mo/Au interface and hole transfer through the donor levels. Instead of increasing reaction temperature from the external environment, some photocatalysts, such as black TiO2, and MoO3−xetc.,22–25 can be heated in situ by themselves through the photothermal effect generated in the NIR region. NIR photothermal effects can improve the solar energy utilization efficiency via increasing the carrier concentration during HER and thus promote the HER rate.21,26–29 Therefore, it is significant to improve the comprehensive utilization of solar light via surveying the influence of photothermal effects of photocatalysts on themselves in the NIR region during HER.
Herein, we demonstrated that the NIR photothermal conversion of photocatalysts can be used to promote HER by taking amorphous carbon nitrogen nanosheets with nitrogen vacancies as a typical photocatalyst. Firstly, we prepared ultrathin a-CN nanosheets from g-C3N4. Then, we fabricated amorphous carbon nitrogen with nitrogen vacancies (a-CNN) nanosheets by calcining a-CN nanosheets in the present of NH4Cl. The color of the samples changed from light yellow (a-CN) to dark brown (a-CNN), which implies the better absorption in a wide range of solar light wavelengths. Our measurements showed that, compared with a-CN nanosheets, a-CNN nanosheets not only have superior absorption, but also exhibit a high photothermal conversion efficiency in the reign of 200–1200 nm. As expected, the HER rate of a-CNN nanosheets is promoted to 3.1 mmol g−1 h−1 from 0.71 mmol g−1 h−1 of a-CN ones under visible light irradiation. Importantly, in situ characterization techniques clarify the detailed mechanism of photothermal conversion assisted photocatalytic HER. It is demonstrated that 16% promotion of photocatalytic hydrogen production is attributed to the contribution of the NIR photothermal conversion. Therefore, these results showed that NIR photothermal conversion of photocatalysts can be expected to be an effective approach to enhance photocatalytic HER.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Structure and morphology characterizations
The BCN (bulk g-C3N4) was synthesized in a typical method. 5 g melamine was placed in a porcelain boat with a cover and subsequently put into a muffle furnace, and heated to 500 °C with a rate of 5 °C min−1, then to 550 °C in 4 h. The preparation process of carbon nitride nanosheets (CNNS), a-CN and a-CNN is shown in Fig. 1. To obtain g-C3N4 nanosheets, a mixture of melamine and ammonium chloride was heated using the same programmed heating process as for BCN. During the polymerization of melamine, NH4Cl decomposed into ammonia and hydrogen chloride gases with the increase of temperature, which inhibited the aggregation of melamine and resulted in 2D g-C3N4 nanosheets. 2D g-C3N4 nanosheets were then thermally oxidized to ultrathin a-CN nanosheets. The a-CN was further treated with NH4Cl under 400 °C for 1 h, which creates numerous N vacancies and extra carbon atoms. The sp2 hybridized structure can be formed due to the extra carbon atoms. The product was marked as a-CNN. The color of samples changed from light yellow (a-CN) to dark brown (a-CNN), as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The brown black color of a-CNN implies that it has better light absorption in a wide range of light wavelengths.
 Fig. 1  The schema shows the preparation process of different samples. TEM and the corresponding SAED patterns of BCN (a), CNNS (b), a-CN (c), and a-CNN (d). 
In order to unravel the effect of the structure and morphology on photocatalytic activities, different techniques were used and the samples were systemically characterized. The micro morphology of samples was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). From the TEM images (Fig. 1a), it can be seen that BCN has a thick aggregated morphology. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED, inset Fig. 1a) of BCN illustrates the six-fold symmetry completely consistent with the expected hexagonal structure of g-C3N4. However, the layered structure of CNNS can be observed from Fig. 1b. The CNNS presents a wrinkled and rough layer morphology, which suggested that the aggregation of g-C3N4 was inhibited successfully by the decomposition of NH4Cl during the polymerization of melamine. When the thermal oxidation was employed for CNNS, a-CN was almost transparent to electron beams and had quite a similar curving appearance to graphene as depicted in Fig. 1c, which suggests that the CNNS was exfoliated to an ultrathin layered structure. However, when the ultrathin a-CN was treated with NH4Cl, the a-CNN presented slight agglomeration, as shown in Fig. 1d. The SAED, inset Fig. 1c and d) of a-CN and a-CNN are shown in Fig. 1. Typical halation but not distinct dots indicate that the as-synthesized sample has an amorphous structure.
Furthermore, AFM was carried out to verify the thickness of different samples. As described in Fig. S2a (ESI†), the thickness of BCN is about 25 nm, suggesting that BCN has an aggregated structure. When NH4Cl was used to inhibit the aggregation of g-C3N4, the thickness of CNNS reduced to about 3.6 nm (Fig. S2b, ESI†). After exfoliation by air thermal oxidation, the thickness of a-CN further decreased to about 1 nm (Fig. S2c, ESI†), indicating the existence of a monolayer or bilayer. However, the monolayer of a-CNN slightly agglomerates after being treated by NH4Cl again. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were conducted to survey the crystal phase change of different samples (Fig. 2a). The patterns demonstrate the same crystal phase for all samples, which presents two diffraction peaks of typical g-C3N4 centered around 13.0° (100) and 27.6° (002).30–33 The peak centered around 13.0° (100) is ascribed to the intralayer long-range atomic order maintained by the hydrogen bonds.34 Another peak centered around 27.6° (002) is attributed to interlayer periodic stacking maintained by van der Waals forces along the c-axis.35,36 Obviously, the intensity of the (002) and (100) peaks is descending order for BCN, CNNS, a-CN and a-CNN. The weaker intensity of (002) indicates that a-CN can partially exfoliate the compact CNNS into an amorphous structure.37 This agrees with the SAED patterns of a-CN and a-CNN (Fig. 1c and d). Fig. S3 (ESI†) is an enlarged version of Fig. 2a in the range of 25° to 30°. Compared with BCN, the (002) peak shifts from 27.44° to 27.75° for CNNS and 27.91° for a-CN. It represents a reduced interlayer distance and the interruption of hydrogen bonds in the sample.38 The breaking of hydrogen bonds is an important way to prepare the amorphous structure. However, the (002) peak of a-CN and a-CNN does not show obvious differences.

To investigate the chemical construction of different samples, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was conducted. From Fig. S4 (ESI†), the typical shape of FTIR spectra of g-C3N4 can be observed, which suggests that all samples have similar chemical structures. The peak around 810 cm−1 is the characteristic breathing mode of s-triazine ring.37 The typical peaks between about 1000 and 1800 cm−1 are caused by the stretching vibration of CN and C–N heterocycles.37 The peak of CNNS, a-CN and a-CNN is much sharper than BCN, which indicates the more complete structure of the s-triazine rings of CNNS, a-CN and a-CNN than BCN. The broad peak of BCN, CNNS and a-CN samples from 3000 to 3600 cm−1 represent the N–H or O–H stretch.37 It is worth noting that even though all samples have similar FTIR spectra, there are some small differences between them. For a-CN, a small peak at 1080 cm−1 appears, which corresponds to C–O vibrations in a-CN, and suggests O group modification in a-CN sample.38
The small differences between different FTIR spectra of samples can be observed through the enlarged spectra in the range of 700–1000 cm−1 and 3000–4000 cm−1. Based on the magnified view in Fig. 2b, the corresponding peak of BCN is blue-shifted from 807.6 cm−1 to 810.2 cm−1 for CNNS, 811.2 for a-CN and a-CNN. The decrease of electron cloud density confirms the breaking of hydrogen bonds and the relatively lower amount of hydrogen bonds in samples, which agrees well with the XRD results.39 The breaking of long range order in-plane caused by hydrogen bonds in samples, is an important way to prepare the amorphous structure. Another difference in the FTIR spectra between a-CNN and other samples is in the range of 3000–3600 cm−1, as shown in Fig. 2b. Some new peaks appear in the FTIR spectra of a-CNN, which might be ascribed to the N vacancies and the sp2 hybridized structure of carbon atoms formed.40 The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of samples was further studied by the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms in detail. As displayed in Fig. 2c, surface area is determined to be 13.9 m2 g−1, 130.8 m2 g−1, 211.5 m2 g−1 and 163.3 m2 g−1 for BCN, CNNS, a-CN and a-CNN, respectively. The obvious increase of BET area for CNNS arises from the inhibition of aggregation of NH4Cl decomposed during melamine polymerization. The further increased BET area of a-CN is ascribed to the exfoliation of CNNS by air thermal oxidation etching.38 The pore size distributions fall within the range of 1 nm to 100 nm (Fig. 2d), indicating the unique ultrathin morphology and rich pore-structure of the samples.
In order to investigate the chemical state of elements in the samples, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed. As displayed in Fig. S5 (ESI†), C 1s and N 1s peaks can be observed in the survey spectra. For the C 1s XPS spectra of samples (Fig. 3a), two peaks around 284.4 eV and 287.8 eV were observed. Generally, the peak at 287.8 eV is attributed to sp2-hybridized C (N–CN).41,42 The other peak at 284.4 eV is identified as the sp2 carbon bond. Interestingly, the peaks of CNNS and a-CN at 284.4 eV almost disappeared, while it became stronger for a-CNN, which may indicate the numerous N vacancies and the sp2 hybridized structure of carbon atoms in a-CNN. This agrees with the FTIR spectra of a-CNN in Fig. 2b. The N 1s (Fig. 3b) spectra of all samples can be differentiated and imitated into three peaks with binding energies of 398.7, 399.8 and 401.0 eV. The main peak around 398.6 eV is attributed to sp2-bonded nitrogen in tri-s-triazine rings (C–NC). The peak centered at 399.8 eV is assigned to the tertiary nitrogen N–(C)3 groups in general.43 The peak at 400.9 eV represents the amino groups (C–N–Hx).43 The charging effects or positive charge localization in heterocycles cause the small peak centered at 404.1 eV.

To better understand the formation of the sp2 hybridized structure of carbon atoms in a-CNN, X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) analysis was employed. Fig. 3c and d show the C K-edge and N K-edge XANES spectra, respectively, of BCN, CNNS, a-CN and a-CNN. In the spectra of C K-edge, all samples exhibit similar features, which indicates that all of them have the g-C3N4 local structure, there are some small differences in a-CNN. The π* excited CC bonds at the defect sites can be observed at 285.4 eV in a-CNN,38 which is smaller and not obvious in the other samples (BCN, CNNS, a-CN). It verifies the sp2 hybridized structure formation of carbon atoms in a-CNN. The other main features (around 288.2 eV and 294.0 eV) may be due to the π* and s* excitations of C–N–C bonds in the g-C3N4 structure, respectively.
N K-edge XANES spectra of the samples were employed to characterize the structure of samples, as shown in Fig. 3d. Three main peaks can be observed in all samples. They can be assigned to the π* excitations of pyridinic-type (about 399 eV) and graphitic-type N species (about 402.5 eV) in the g-C3N4 ring structure; and the s* excitation of C–N–C or C–N (N–3C bridging) bonds (the broad feature around 404.5 eV).38 Interestingly, compared with a-CN, the s* excitation of C–N bonds in a-CNN shows obviously decreased intensity. The results indicate that even in the more disordered amorphous structure of a-CNN, the ring structure can be preserved to keep the excellent properties of a-CNN.
The structural defects can be investigated by the atomic ratio of carbon to nitrogen. The atomic ratio of C/N calculated by XPS (Table 1) is 0.75 in ideal g-C3N4. The atomic ratio of C/N is 0.749 for BCN. When NH4Cl was used to form 2D g-C3N4 nanosheets during the polymerization of melamine, the atomic ratio of C/N decreased to 0.713 for CNNS. The decreased atomic ratio of C/N suggests that the N atoms coming from decomposition of NH4Cl might be doped into the CNNS. However, when a-CN was treated with NH4Cl, the atomic ratio of C/N increased from 0.702 to 0.802 for a-CNN, which suggests plenty of N vacancies. The abundance of nitrogen vacancies can induce the sp2 hybridized structure of carbon atoms to form due to the extra carbon atoms in a-CNN nanosheets. The difference between the formation of N vacancies or N doping in processing may be attributed to the different conditions during calcination.

2.2. Optical properties and photocatalytic H2 evolution activity
The structural characterizations have confirmed that NH4Cl benefits the formation of N doping or N vacancies. As a consequence, a-CNN with its dark-grey color presents obvious excellent optical properties over BCN and CNNS with yellow color, and a-CN with light white color, as shown in Fig. 4a. Compared with BCN, the absorption spectrum of CNNS possesses a significant blue shifted from 460 nm to 440 nm even though they have a similar weak absorption band starting from the onset to the end at around 800 nm. The blue shift may originate from the quantum effect caused by the reduction of layer thickness of CNNS and a-CN. However, when a-CN was treated with NH4Cl again, the absorption tail noticeably increased from 450 nm to 1200 nm. Based on the structural analyses, the increased absorption tail may be attributed to the N vacancies or sp2 hybridized structure of carbon atoms. The absorption tail in a-CNN suggests that sp2 hybridized carbon may create a new band level. The transformed Kubelka–Munk function versus the light energy (Fig. S6, ESI†) gives an optical band gap widening by 0.15 eV, from 2.81 eV for BCN to 2.96 eV for CNNS, a-CN and a-CNN. The widening of band gaps originate from the quantum effect due to the ultrathin layer structures of CNNS, a-CN and a-CNN. To further investigate the band structure of samples, the valence band position was analysed by XPS, as shown in Fig. 4b. Combining the valence band and the optical band gap obtained from Fig. 4a and Fig. S6 (ESI†), the simplified schematic diagram of band structure of samples can be pictured in Fig. 4c. Compared with other samples, a-CNN may have an impurity band level caused by sp2 hybridized carbon, which can be inferred from the absorption tail in a-CNN.

(i) Hydrogen production rates of a-CN and a-CNN using different light sources. 
The radiative recombination process and transfer process of the photon-generated carrier of samples was surveyed by steady-state/time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectra,44,45 as pictured in Fig. 4d and e. For BCN, the PL spectrum exhibits a strong emission peak at 460 nm, which should be derived from the band-to-band recombination of the photon-generated carrier. However, for the thin layer of CNNS, a-CN and a-CNN, the PL emission peak shift to 450 nm is due to the quantum effect and the widening optical band gap caused by the reduction of layer thickness. It should be noted that the emission intensity of a-CNN is much weaker than a-CN, which could be explained by the quenching effect of N vacancies or the sp2 hybridized structure of carbon atoms. Fig. 4e presents the time resolved PL spectra of samples at the wavelength of the emission peak. It can be observed clearly that the a-CNN exhibits a shorter PL lifetime than a-CN, which can be caused by the faster transfer of photon-generated carriers of a-CNN or the enhancement of nonradiative recombination.
To evaluate the activities of the catalysts, a series of photocatalytic HER was performed. The tests of different samples with 1 wt% Pt as cocatalyst were conducted in 100 mL aqueous solution containing 10 % (v/v) triethanolamine as an electron donor under visible light illumination (a xenon lamp equipped with a CUT400 filter, 80 mW cm−1). As pictured in Fig. 4f, the HER rates increased gradually from 0.96 for BCN to 3.34 for CNNS, to 6.28 for a-CN and to 9.02 mmol g−1 h−1 for a-CNN. The HER rate promotions for CNNS and a-CN are mainly attributed to hydrogen bonds breaking in the intralayer of a-CN nanosheets. Ordinarily, the bigger surface area with porous structures could supply plentiful edges which can serve as active sites during photocatalytic HER and bring out better properties. However, a-CNN has a smaller surface area but a better HER rate than a-CN. Two reasons for the better HER rate of a-CNN are the broader light absorption and the faster transfer of photon-generated carrier as proven above. Fig. 4g displays the HER rates of a-CN with different Pt weight percentages under irradiation from a xenon lamp equipped with an AM1.5 (100 mW cm−1) or CUT400 (80 mW cm−1) filter. The maximum attainable HER rates can reach 50.51 mmol g−1 h−1. Due to the better light absorption of a-CNN in the range of 450–1200 nm, the interests of photocatalytic HER activity in this light range were aroused. As shown in Fig. 4h, the photocatalytic HER activities under single wavelength (QD500 filter, 500 ± 5 nm) and NIR (CUT800 filter) were surveyed. The black curve in Fig. 4i is the light absorption intensity in the range of 200–1200 nm. It implies that the light absorption of a-CNN is in the visible and NIR range. The a-CNN spectra reveals its better photocatalytic HER activity (0.77 mmol g−1 h−1) over a-CN (0.37 mmol g−1 h−1) under illumination of 500 ± 5 nm. However, all of a-CN and a-CNN shows trace activities under the CUT800 filter. The average intensity of irradiation was determined to be 5.32 mW cm−2. The apparent quantum efficiency (0.34% for a-CNN and 0.16% for a-CN) was calculated based on the photocatalytic HER activity of samples at QD500.
The effect of NIR light on photocatalytic hydrogen evolution was characterized using dual Xenon lamp irradiation (Fig. S7, ESI†). Lamp 1 provides visible light with a VisREF and CUT420 filter. Lamp 2 is equipped with a CUT800 filter to study the impact of NIR on the photocatalytic process. Compared to the HER rate without lamp 2, the rate of a-CNN possesses a promotion of almost 16% with lamp 2, from 3.1 mmol g−1 h−1 to 3.6 mmol g−1 h−1, as shown in Fig. 4f. However, the HER rate of a-CN did not change obviously (about 0.71 mmol g−1 h−1). The samples after photocatalytic reaction were characterized by High-Angle Annular Dark Field (Acquire HAADF Scanning), as shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). It can be observed that the added Pt elements are distributed as clusters in the samples during photocatalytic H2 evolution.
2.3. Photothermal conversion properties

Fig. 5a shows the UV-Vis-NIR absorbance curves (red curve shows a-CNN and black shows a-CN) and NIR light spectrum of the light used. It can be observed that a-CNN presents an obvious light absorption in the range of 800–1200 nm. The insert shows photos of a-CN (light white one) and a-CNN (black grey one). The photothermal effects of the dry solid samples were studied in the NIR region. As shown in Fig. 5b, the temperature of the a-CNN increased from 26.3 to 60.7 °C within 4 min and then reached a steady state under NIR radiation, with an increase of about 35 °C. However, the temperature of a-CN only increased from 25.1 °C to 40.4 °C, which is only an increase of about 15 °C. The difference in maximum temperature between the two samples reaches up to 20.3 °C under the same conditions. The superior photothermal properties can be attributed to the formation of the sp2 hybridized structure of carbon atoms caused by the N vacancies in a-CNN. To give a visual description, thermal images of a-CN and a-CNN under NIR irradiation are shown in Fig. 5c.
 Fig. 5  (a) The red and black curves show the Vis-NIR light absorbance of a-CNN and a-CN, the blue curve shows the light spectrum of the xenon lamp with a CUT800 filter. (b) and (c) show the time-dependent temperature and thermal image variations for a-CN and a-CNN under NIR light (100 mW cm−2). 
The different light photothermal conversion properties were explored. The temperatures under different light were recorded as shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). The increment difference of temperature decreased from 20.3 °C under NIR illumination to 16.5 °C under simulated sunlight (AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2) irradiation (Fig. S9a, ESI†). Fig. S9b and c (ESI†) show the temperature change of a-CN and a-CNN under different light sources (100 mW cm−2), respectively. Under the same optical power density but a different light source, a-CN shows a better response for AM1.5 (ΔT = 6 °C), but a-CNN has an excellent response for NIR (ΔT = 2 °C), which is in line with the difference of absorption of a-CN and a-CNN in the NIR region.
2.4. Mechanism for the photothermal conversion enhanced photocatalytic activity
Three major steps influencing the activity are involved in the overall photocatalytic water-splitting reaction: (a) the carrier concentration; (b) charge separation and transfer; and (c) surface reaction for the formation of H2.46 Domen et al. proved that the dependence of the H2O and D2O splitting rates on reaction temperature obeyed the Arrhenius equation over the temperature range 275–321 K. They also proved that the enhancement of the rate of photocatalytic water splitting with increasing reaction temperature was related to bulk processes rather than surface processes.47 For amorphous materials, carrier concentration and mobility can be enhanced by heat, which are the important factors responsible for enhancing water splitting reactions.48,49
In a-CNN, photothermal conversion could increase the carrier concentration and the drift rate of the photoinduced electrons in situ and thus enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. In amorphous materials, carrier concentration can be promoted thermally.47,48 To characterize the increase of carrier concentration in a-CNN caused by the photothermal conversion, the PL spectra were conducted with extra irradiation from an 808 nm laser (Fig. 6). The test equipment is represented in Fig. 6a. In the same sample and under the same conditions, the higher PL intensity suggests more carrier is generated. The PL intensity of a-CNN was enhanced with irradiation from an extra 808 nm laser, which indicates more carrier can be generated with the assistance of NIR photothermal conversion. More carrier can accelerate the reaction of photocatalytic hydrogen production. Furthermore, the PL peak of a-CNN shifts to 467 nm from 450 nm, which can be attributed to the influence of NIR photothermal conversion on the band structure of a-CNN. Upconversion may cause the increase of the PL intensity of a-CNN with the extra 808 nm laser, however, it should be excluded. Upconversion in carbon nitride is usually caused by the upconversion-agent or the oxygen/amino-containing functional groups.50 The samples of a-CN and a-CNN did not have an upconversion-agent; and a-CN also contains these functional groups, while the PL intensity and peak site of a-CN did not change with/without 808 nm laser irradiation, as shown in Fig. S10a (ESI†). So, the PL intensity enhancement of a-CNN should be attributed to the increase of carrier concentration caused by the influence of NIR photothermal conversion.

(h) A simplified diagram of the mechanism for the photothermal conversion assisted photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity. 
The influence of NIR photothermal conversion on the band structure of a-CNN can be detected by the change of the samples work function. The samples work function can be obtained from surface potential conducted by a Kelvin probe force microscope (KPFM). Fig. 6c is the surface potential difference of a-CNN without/with 808 nm laser irradiation (white line in Fig. 6d and e, respectively). From Fig. 6c, the smaller surface potential of a-CNN is obtained with the 808 nm laser irradiation, than that without the 808 nm laser irradiation. The smaller surface potential indicates the bigger work function (surface potential = work function of probe − work function of sample, work function of probe is constant), which implies that the Fermi level of a-CNN shifted downward under the 808 nm laser irradiation. The downward shift of the Fermi level also means an increase of carrier concentration, which can promote the reaction rate of photocatalytic hydrogen production. However, the surface potential demonstrated almost no change with/without 808 nm laser irradiation (Fig. S10b, ESI†).
Another factor influencing photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is the mobility or drift rate of the carriers. In an amorphous material, the mobility or drift rate of carriers can be promoted by heat.48 The quick mobility or drift of carriers can reach a higher hydrogen evolution rate.51–53 As shown in the I–V curves pictured in Fig. 6f, the curve slope near 0 V became bigger under 808 nm laser irradiation, which implies the carriers can move or drift more easily than those without the 808 nm laser irradiation. Fig. 6g shows the PL decay time of a-CNN with/without the extra 808 nm laser during the characterization process. It can be observed that the PL decay time of a-CNN under 808 nm laser irradiation had a small change to a shorter time. This may be caused by the quick mobility/drift of carriers, or the nonradiative recombination of carriers due to the NIR photothermal conversion of a-CNN. However, for a-CNN, the slope near 0 V in the I–V curve did not show obvious changes with/without the extra 808 nm laser during the characterization process, neither did the PL decay time (Fig. S10–S12, ESI†).

Fig. 6h shows the simplified mechanism diagram for the photothermal conversion assisted photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity. It gives a possible consequence of NIR photothermal conversion on the band structure of a-CNN. In amorphous materials, carrier concentration and the drift rate of carriers can be promoted by heat, and thus prompt HER. In a-CNN, the NIR photothermal conversion can promote: (a) the carrier concentration; (b) the rate of charge separation and transfer, which can accelerate the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.48,49
2.5. The comprehensive utilization of solar light
NIR photothermal conversion of photocatalysts can be expected to be an effective approach to enhance photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and more comprehensively utilize solar light, as shown in Fig. 7. For a-CNN, the extra carbon atoms can form an sp2 hybridized structure, which is the reason for the excellent NIR photothermal conversion.54,55 The excellent NIR photothermal conversion can lead to the increase of carrier concentration and the mobility or drift rate of carriers in a-CNN. The increase of HER rate can be mainly attributed to photothermal conversion of photocatalysts. The excellent NIR photothermal conversion would be very beneficial for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions and for the comprehensive utilization of solar light.

3. Conclusion
In summary, we have demonstrated an effective approach to enhance photocatalytic hydrogen evolution by creating an NIR photothermal conversion of the photocatalysts themselves by constructing unique structure like “hot islands”. In this case, we introduced nitrogen vacancies into a-CN nanosheets to induce forming the sp2 hybridized structure (hot islands) of carbon in amorphous nanosheets. It was found that this unique structure leads to a fluorescence quenching phenomenon in the visible light region, which created superior light absorption. Meanwhile, it also makes better NIR light absorption, which further results in a stronger NIR photothermal conversion which greatly promotes photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Therefore, NIR photothermal conversion of photocatalysts can be expected to be a facile approach to improve solar energy utilization efficiency.
4. Experimental section
Chemicals
Melamine was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Ammonium chloride was purchased from Aladdin reagent co. LTD. All the chemicals were of analytical grade and used without further purification.
The synthesis of bulk g-C3N4
BCN was synthesized by a typical procedure: 5 g melamine was placed in a porcelain boat with a cover and subsequently put into a muffle furnace, and heated to 500 °C at a rate of 5 °C min−1, then to 550 °C in 4 h. After cooling to room temperature, the obtained product was ground into powder as BCN.
The synthesis of g-C3N4 nanosheets
g-C3N4 nanosheets (CNNS) were achieved with the same method as BCN was prepared. g-C3N4 nanosheets (CNNS) were achieved with the same method as BCN was prepared. That is, 2 g melamine and 10 g ammonium chloride was ground and then was added into a porcelain boat. The thermal polymerization method is the same as for BCN.
The synthesis of amorphous carbon nitrogen nanosheets
300 mg g-C3N4 nanosheets was placed in a porcelain boat and heated to 500 °C in 100 min in a tube furnace, then they were kept at this temperature for another 2 h in air. The product was a-CN nanosheets.
The synthesis of amorphous carbon nitrogen nanosheets with nitrogen vacancies
4 g ammonium chloride and 50 mg a-CN nanosheets was put into one glass tube but not mixed. It was heated to 400 °C in 100 min, and then kept at this temperature for another 2 h. After cooling to room temperature, the sample of a-CNN nanosheets was obtained.
Material characterization
The morphology and SAED patterns of the obtained products were represented using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2). The structures of the samples were characterized in an X-ray diffractometer (D/MAX-2200, Rigaku). The BET surface area of the samples was obtained with Micrometrics ASAP 2020 apparatus, where the samples were outgassed in situ at 200 °C for 12 h. The UV-Vis-NIR absorption of the samples was characterized using a UV-Vis-NIR Spectrophotometer Lambda 950 (UK). The Edinburgh spectrofluorophotometer (FLS980) was used to record the PL spectra with/without 808 nm laser irradiation. High-resolution XPS patterns of samples were measured on an XPS scanning microprobe spectrometer (Escalab 250, Thermo-VG Scientific, England, Al Kα) with respect to the position of the Au 4f peak at 84.0 eV. Specific surface area of the samples was carried out by Micromeritics ASAP2460. The samples surface potential’s were measured by a KPFM (Dimension Fastscan, Bruker) to evaluate the Fermi level changes and I–V curves with/without 808 nm laser irradiation. XAFS spectra were measured at the BL08U1A beamline of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility.
Evaluation of photocatalytic hydrogen production
The H2 evolution of the photocatalysts was analysed using a CEL-SPH2N-D9 photocatalytic activity test system (Aulight Co., Beijing, China). A 300 W Xenon lamp with AM1.5G, UV-Vis and a QD500 filter were employed as the light source (100, 80, 11.3 mW cm−2, respectively). Gas chromatography (GC, TCD detector, 5 Å molecular sieve column) was used to detect the concentration of H2, and Ar was used as the carrier gas. Photocatalytic H2 evolution tests were conducted in 10% triethanolamine (100 mL) in a top-irradiation-type Pyrex glass cell. Generally, 10 mg photocatalyst was suspended in the above solution. Platinum with different weight percentages served as the cocatalyst and was loaded on the sample via in situ photodeposition approach with H2PtCl6·6H2O. Before the photocatalysis performance tests, the suspension was stirred with 30 min degassing pretreatment at room temperature. The influence of the photothermal effect on the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution was characterized using dual xenon lamp irradiation. As shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), lamp 1 provides visible light with a VisREF and CUT420 filter. Lamp 2 was equipped with a CUT800 filter to study the impact of photothermal effect in the NIR region on the photocatalytic process. Evaluation of the influence of photothermal effects on the photocatalytic activities were carried out through the comparison of H2 evolution rates by opening or closing the NIR light. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution was conducted in 10% triethanolamine (200 mL) in a Pyrex glass cell. Generally, 10 mg photocatalysts was suspended in the above solution and 1 wt% Pt was loaded onto the sample. The apparent quantum efficiency at QD500 was calculated as follows:  
Photothermal conversion measurements
Photothermal conversion of samples was characterized by illuminating the sample powder with a xenon lamp equipped with different light filters. All luminous power was fixed with 100 mW cm−2. Their temperature was recorded using a thermal imager (Fluke TiS55) every 1 min.
