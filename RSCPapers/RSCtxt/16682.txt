    AbstractSpectral sensitization of a mesoporous graphite carbon nitride (mpg-C3N4) photocatalyst was investigated by depositing magnesium phthalocyanine (MgPc) to expand the absorption to wavelengths longer than those of the principal mpg-C3N4. The obtained sample, MgPc/Pt/mpg-C3N4 (Pt as a cocatalyst) showed stable photocatalytic evolution of hydrogen from aqueous solution in the presence of sacrificial reagents (triethanolamine), even under irradiation at wavelengths longer than 600 nm. Increasing the amount of MgPc led to ordered MgPc aggregation on the photocatalyst surfaces. The rate of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution was highest on a sample with an amount of MgPc corresponding to a monolayer on the Pt/mpg-C3N4 photocatalyst surface. The obtained action spectra of hydrogen evolution and the observation that the amount of evolved hydrogen substantially surpassed the amount of MgPc, confirm that the introduced MgPc functioned as a photocatalytic sensitizer.
1. Introduction
Photocatalytic H2 evolution from aqueous solution is a clean method of generating sustainable energy from sunlight. One area of study is known as artificial photosynthesis, and involves direct solar energy conversion to chemicals on heterogeneous photocatalysts. Considerable effort has been devoted to the development of active, stable photocatalysts for H2 evolution that can function under the abundant visible light in the solar spectrum.1,2 Because visible light comprises a large portion of the solar energy reaching the surface of the earth, the utilization of visible light is essential for efficient solar energy conversion. Some metal oxynitrides with d0 and d10 electronic structure have achieved overall water splitting under visible light irradiation,1–3 but most active photocatalysts have been composed of rare metals, such as Ga, Ge, In, Ta, or Nb, which has inhibited large-scale application. The development of photocatalysts based on abundant elements, with strong absorption in the visible region, remains a challenge.
Carbonaceous semiconductors have attracted attention because of the abundance of these elements on Earth. Yanagida et al. reported that p-phenylene showed photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution under visible light in the presence of triethanolamine (TEOA) as an electron donor.4 Recently, covalent graphitic-carbon nitride (g-C3N4) semiconductor powders have been reported, with the band edges straddling the water redox potentials. These powders can function as metal-free photocatalysts to reduce or oxidize water in the presence of sacrificial reagents, evolving H2 or O2, respectively.5,6 Soft chemical routes and methods can give ordered nanostructures of g-C3N4 by using carbon nitride precursors and various templates.7–9 Using various shapes and sizes of silica templates, such as Ludox colloidal silica9 and ordered mesoporous SBA-15 silica,10 various types of photocatalyst can be attained. Mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (mpg-C3N4) with a high surface area (∼200 m2 g−1) was found to be more active for photocatalytic H2 evolution than bulk g-C3N4.9,10
An efficient photocatalytic system for energy conversion from sunlight to chemicals requires the absorption of light in the red wavelengths, which comprise a large portion of the available solar energy. The lack of absorption above 600 nm of g-C3N4 requires additional techniques to utilize this range of irradiation in the photocatalytic reaction. An example of extended light absorption was successfully demonstrated by copolymerization from dicyandiamide and barbituric acid, in which the extent of copolymerization can be used to tune the electronic and optical properties of the product.11 The obtained hybrid semiconductors were capable of extending light absorption up to 750 nm, which could be utilized for photocatalytic reaction.11 The photocatalytic efficiency, however, requires further improvement.
Sensitization of photoelectrodes with dyes has successfully enabled energy conversion of light at longer wavelengths, especially in photovoltaic cells.12,13 Bard and co-workers extensively studied the sensitization of various semiconductors with phthalocyanine dye for photovoltaic devices, demonstrating both anodic and cathodic photocurrents associated with the excitation of phthalocyanine.14,15 Grätzel and his group developed dye-sensitized solar cells, the electrodes of which were formed by printing TiO2 on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), followed by dye modification.13 The dyes extended the light absorption, generating excited electrons and holes, which resulted in a high solar energy efficiency of more than 10%.16 Additional studies of sensitized solar cells are currently underway. Organic materials were employed as sensitization dyes in a few cases,17–19 but detailed studies on the sensitization of photocatalysts for H2 evolution remain incomplete.
This study deals with phthalocyanine dye sensitization of mpg-C3N4 photocatalyst for H2 evolution, in an attempt to absorb light over a wider range of wavelengths. We examined phthalocyanine dyes first, since these appeared to be the most appropriate starting point for this study because of their high chemical stability, absorption of light around ∼670 nm, and structural similarity to g-C3N4, as depicted in Fig. 1. Both materials contain planar layers with π electron conjugation and are mainly composed of carbon and nitrogen, and were therefore expected to strongly interact with each other. Moreover, the oxidation potential of the photogenerated hole of g-C3N4 is insufficient to oxide hydroxyl group to hydroxyl radicals,11 making g-C3N4 a particularly suitable photocatalyst for hosting organic dye molecules to ensure stable sensitization under full solar spectrum.

2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of MgPc/Pt/mpg-C3N4
A unity mass ratio of silica to cyanamide was used to synthesize mpg-C3N4. Cyanamide (20 g, Aldrich) was dissolved in a 40 wt% dispersion of 12 nm SiO2 particles in water (50 g, Ludox HS-40, Aldrich) with stirring at 353 K for about 3 h to evaporate the water. The resulting white powder was then heated at a rate of 2.3 K min−1 over 4 h to reach a temperature of 823 K, and then held at this temperature for an additional 4 h. The resulting brown-yellow powder was stirred in 200 mL of 4 M NH4HF2 (95%, Wako Chemicals) for 2 h, followed by filtration and washing with 100 mL of H2O and 50 mL of ethanol (99.5%, Kanto Chemicals). This washing cycle was repeated to completely remove the silica template. The powder was then stirred in 200 mL of H2O for 2 h, then filtered and washed with H2O and ethanol. Finally, the powders were dried at 393 K overnight. The yield of mpg-C3N4 was ∼40%, based on carbon content.
An aqueous solution of H2PtCl6·6H2O (Wako Chemicals), with a volume equivalent to the pore volume of the employed mpg-C3N4 (0.8 cm3 g−1, typically 2 g of mpg-C3N4 was employed), was used to impregnate the mpg-C3N4 to attain 3 wt% Pt. After evaporation of the water at ∼373 K, the powder was dried in static air at 423 K for 1 h. The sample was treated in ethanol with a 10:1 molar ratio of NaBH4 (Wako Chemicals) to Pt, followed by filtration and thorough washing with ethanol.
The required amount of MgPc (95.0%, Tokyo Chemical Industry, 0.01–0.50 wt% of the photocatalyst) was dissolved in 1 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF), and 0.5 g of the Pt/mpg-C3N4 powder was added. The suspension was continuously stirred at room temperature until the THF was completely evaporated. The obtained powder was treated in a muffle furnace at 373 K for 1 h, and then used for photocatalytic reactions and characterization.
2.2 Photocatalytic reactions
Photocatalytic reactions were carried out in a Pyrex top-irradiation-type reaction vessel connected to a glass closed gas circulation system. The reaction was performed in distilled water containing 0.10 g of the sample in an aqueous solution with triethanolamine (TEOA, 10 vol%, 100 mL) as a sacrificial reagent, without pH control (pH∼10). The reactant solution was initially evacuated several times to completely remove the air, and then irradiated using a 300 W xenon lamp equipped with a cutoff filter and a water filter. The reactant solution was maintained at 298 K by a flow of cooling water during the reaction. The evolved gases were analyzed by a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (Shimadzu GC-8A, molecular sieve 5A column). The spectral irradiances were measured by using an Eiko Seiki model solar simulator spectroradiometer LS-100.
2.3 Characterization
Ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflectance spectrometry (UV–VIS DRS; V-670, Jasco) was performed in reference to BaSO4 powder. Structures were characterized by X-ray diffractometry (XRD; RINT 2100, Rigaku) using Cu-Kα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was recorded under vacuum using a JASCO FT-IR-6200 spectrometer equipped with an MCT detector in transmission mode. A suspension containing 20 mg of the sample was dispersed on a BaF2 pellet (∼10 mmϕ) in a miniature cell equipped with NaCl windows. The samples were initially heated to 423 K to remove adsorbed water. Each spectrum, which consisted of 256 scans taken at 4 cm−1 resolution, was collected at 298 K. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area were measured using a BELSORP-mini instrument (BEL Japan) at 77 K. Photoemission yield spectroscopy in air (AC-3, RIKEN KEIKI Co., Ltd.) was used to estimate the valence band maximum. Measurements were performed using different powers (0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 mW) to take the possible charge-up into account, and the values were calibrated in reference to Au (work function: 4.77 V vs. vacuum).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Optical and structural properties of MgPc/Pt/C3N4
Phthalocyanine is a well-known dye for photocatalyst sensitization, and typically absorbs visible light in the range 600–700 nm, which is known as the Q-band and is responsible for the characteristic intense blue color of the dye (Fig. 2).20 Most metal phthalocyanines are stable, rigid, and insoluble in most solvents, and are generally deposited on a semiconductor photocatalyst (e.g., TiO2) by sublimation at relatively high temperatures. Among these metal phthalocyanines, magnesium phthalocyanine is soluble in THF solution, so that conventional impregnation can distribute the dye on a photocatalyst surface for modification. The loading amount of MgPc was varied from 0.01–0.50 wt% in this study.

Fig. 2 shows UV–VIS spectra of mpg-C3N4 samples modified with different loadings of MgPc. Phthalocyanine dye has a very high absorption coefficient (typically 2 × 105 cm2 mol−1),20 and even a low MgPc loading resulted in distinct MgPc absorption peaks. The Q-band absorption at 600–720 nm was assigned to a π–π* transition from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), of a1u symmetry to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of eg symmetry.20 At a low loading of 0.01 wt% MgPc, the absorption spectrum was similar to that of MgPc in THF solution (Fig. S1†), confirming the successful loading of phthalocyanine onto the mpg-C3N4. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the Q-band exhibits characteristic splitting due to vibronic coupling in the excited state. For solid samples, two absorption peaks were observed at ∼600/650 and 650/700 nm, originating from Davydov splitting due to molecular exciton coupling, which typically occurs due to an excited state resonance interaction in loosely bound molecular systems.20 Loading 0.05 wt% of MgPc produced an additional absorption peak in the near-IR region at ∼820 nm. This peak was assigned to an ‘X phase’ structure with hydrated MgPc.21 We confirmed that this longer wavelength absorption at ∼820 nm could be selectively diminished by heat treatment at 523 K, as shown in Fig. S1.† This is consistent with the argument that the ‘X phase’ arose from H2O-containing species in the MgPc-based layer.21 The absorbance increased with increasing MgPc loading, with a very broad absorbance at 500–1150 nm, as shown in Fig. 2.
XRD patterns of mpg-C3N4 modified with different loadings of MgPc are shown in Fig. 3. An XRD pattern of MgPc powder (as purchased) is also shown for reference. Broad peaks were observed at 2θ of 13.0 (d = 0.681 nm) and 27.4° (d = 0.326 nm), which were assigned to the in-planar distance between nitride pores and graphite-like stacking of the conjugated aromatic units of g-C3N4, respectively.22 Increasing the amount of deposited MgPc resulted in an apparent phase ascribable to an MgPc ordered structure. It can be seen from the figure that a higher loading of MgPc led to the accumulation of MgPc, which likely formed layers on the mpg-C3N4 surfaces, as reported in the literature.23Fig. 4 shows FTIR spectra of mpg-C3N4, MgPc/mpg-C3N4, and MgPc powders. Although no apparent changes in IR absorbance were observed between the 0.05 wt% MgPc sample and bare mpg-C3N4, the peaks originating from MgPc became pronounced at 0.5 wt% loading. For example, the peaks at 1060, 1080, and 1113 cm−1 were attributable to the bending mode β(C–H), and stretching mode υ(C–N) and β(C–H) from benzene and pyrrole rings, respectively.24 Consistent with the XRD patterns, the IR spectra suggested that the modification of mpg-C3N4 with MgPc was achieved at increased MgPc loading.

N2 adsorption–desorption measurements were performed at 77 K, and the BET surface area and pore volume results are compiled in Table 1. Both surface area and pore volume decreased drastically after Pt loading and subsequent heat treatment at 423 K (239 to 82 m2 g−1 and 0.76 to 0.34 cm3 g−1, respectively). Loading 0.05 wt% MgPc caused only a slight decrease in surface area (64 m2 g−1) and pore volume, compared to Pt/mpg-C3N4. Further loading of MgPc up to 0.5 wt% led to decreases in surface area (26 m2 g−1) and pore volume (0.09 cm3 g−1). These results suggest that the loaded MgPc covered the mpg-C3N4 surface, eventually filling or blocking the mpg-C3N4 mesopores. Assuming that the MgPc was 1.4 nm in diameter,20 a surface area of 82 m2 g−1 of Pt/mpg-C3N4 corresponds to a monolayer of ∼0.15 wt% MgPc.

3.2 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution using MgPc/Pt/C3N4
A small amount of platinum cocatalyst was reported to improve the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 by a factor of ∼750, by reducing barriers to the formation of dihydrogen molecules.9 It was also reported that the photocatalytic activity of mesoporous C3N4 (mpg-C3N4) photocatalyst was much higher than that of non-porous C3N4 (g-C3N4) photocatalyst.9 Using mpg-C3N4 with a surface area of 239 m2 g−1 (Table 1), deposition of 3–5 wt% Pt on mpg-C3N4 maximized the photocatalytic rates of H2 evolution (Fig. S2†). Thus, we report the results of 3 wt% Pt loaded samples in this manuscript. The 3 wt% Pt/mpg-C3N4 sample had a photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of ∼50 μmol h−1 at a light intensity of 1.1 × 1021 h−1 through a BP-42 HOYA band-pass filter (with the spectral distribution shown in Fig. S4†), from an aqueous solution containing TEOA as a sacrificial reagent, resulting in a quantum efficiency of ∼5.6% at 420 nm.
Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution in the presence of TEOA as an electron donor was investigated on MgPc-modified Pt/mpg-C3N4 samples under irradiation using an R64 cutoff filter to control the wavelength (the spectral distribution is shown in Fig. S3†). Fig. 5 shows the steady-state rates of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution as a function of MgPc loading. Although a Pt/mpg-C3N4 sample without MgPc modification produced a very low rate of hydrogen evolution (< 0.5 μmol h−1), MgPc-modified Pt/mpg-C3N4 drastically improved the hydrogen evolution rate. The hydrogen evolution rate was highest with 0.05 wt% MgPc loading, and decreased with further MgPc loading. As discussed previously, loading 0.5 wt% MgPc formed ordered MgPc layers on the photocatalyst surfaces (Fig. 3 and 4), resulting in a drastic decrease in photocatalytic activity, although the absorbance was enhanced (Fig. 2). The 0.05–0.10 wt% loading is close to the expected value for a monolayer of MgPc (0.15 wt%) covering the Pt/mpg-C3N4 surface (82 m2 g−1). It is likely that the formation of a dye monolayer on the photocatalyst surface maximized the photocatalytic activity, and further increases in dye loading decreased the photocatalytic efficiency.
 Fig. 5  The steady-state rates of H2 evolution using MgPc/Pt/mpg-C3N4 photocatalysts with different MgPc loadings in the photocatalytic reaction under visible light using an L42 cutoff filter (filled circle) and an R64 cutoff filter (open circle) (0.1 g cat.; 3 wt% Pt; 300 W Xe lamp; 10 vol% triethanolamine aqueous solution, 100 mL; Pyrex upper-irradiation vessel). 
The decrease in photocatalytic activity with excess MgPc loading can be attributed to a decrease in available Pt surface, which provides H2 evolution sites. To investigate this contribution, hydrogen evolution under irradiation through an L42 cutoff filter (the spectral distribution is shown in Fig. S3†) was also investigated (Fig. 5), where photoexcitation of mpg-C3N4 instead of MgPc was predominantly responsible for the reaction. In this case, the photocatalyst without MgPc showed the highest rate of H2 evolution, and the photocatalytic activity decreased monotonically with increasing MgPc loading. This decrease is mainly attributable to the blockage of Pt surfaces by MgPc. However, the decrease in photocatalytic activity with an L42 cutoff filter was less than with an R64 filter. Even 0.5 wt% MgPc loading resulted in a reasonably high rate of H2 evolution with the L42 filter, whereas the activity was almost completely lost using the R64 filter. This implies that the decrease in photocatalytic activity using an R64 filter is not only because of the decrease in available Pt surface.
To elucidate the reasons for the decrease in activity, charge transfer of excitons generated by MgPc is discussed, considering the electronic structure of MgPc/Pt/mpg-C3N4. Photoelectron spectroscopy measurements in air indicated that the valence band maximum of mpg-C3N4 was +1.92 ± 0.03 V vs. NHE (pH = 0), close to the calculated potential and the electrochemically measured value reported previously.5,11 The position of the conduction band minimum was determined using the band gap of mpg-C3N4 estimated from the obtained UV–VIS spectrum (∼2.7 eV). The HOMO and LUMO levels of MgPc were taken from the literature.15 Pt sites are essential for hydrogen evolution. The diagram depicted in Fig. 6 shows that the photoexcited electrons on MgPc were most likely transferred through the conduction band of mpg-C3N4 to Pt. It is therefore reasonable to consider that the MgPc molecules that were not in contact with mpg-C3N4 would be incapable of efficient charge transfer from MgPc to mpg-C3N4, and dye (MgPc) to dye (MgPc) charge transfer would not occur smoothly. Therefore, a monolayer of dye on the photocatalyst maximizes the overall photocatalytic efficiency. Note that, when direct excitation of mpg-C3N4 occurs, holes photogenerated in the valence band of mpg-C3N4 oxidize TEOA while electrons photogenerated in the conduction band are transferred to Pt to produce H2.

We confirmed stable photocatalytic performance using a 0.05 wt% MgPc/Pt/mpg-C3N4 sample, as shown in Fig. 7. The hydrogen evolution rate remained almost unchanged for 64 h time on course. The total amount of hydrogen evolved (249.4 μmol) greatly surpassed the amount of MgPc loaded (0.09 μmol), confirming that the MgPc functioned as a photosensitizer. Fig. 8 shows action spectra of hydrogen evolution for 0.05 wt% MgPc/Pt/mpg-C3N4 and Pt/mpg-C3N4 using appropriate band-pass filters (irradiance shown in Fig. S4†), in addition to the UV–VIS DRS spectra of the samples. While the sample without MgPc had a very low hydrogen evolution rate with the R60 band-pass filter (< 0.01% quantum efficiency), modification by MgPc drastically improved the photocatalytic efficiency in the range of 600–740 nm. More interestingly, the quantum efficiencies of hydrogen evolution corresponded very well to the absorbance associated with MgPc, resulting in a higher quantum efficiency of 0.07% at 660 nm. This reflects the molecular nature of charge excitation in MgPc, which results from π–π* excitation of the HOMO–LUMO electronic structure, and is consistent with the observation that the added MgPc functioned as a photocatalytic sensitizer. It is worth noting that the photocatalytic test using an IR80 cut-off filter (>800 nm, irradiance shown in Fig. S3†) gave no hydrogen evolution, indicating that the absorption associated with the ‘X-phase’ of MgPc is not photocatalytically active under the conditions investigated.

This study demonstrates that charge transfer from MgPc dye to mpg-C3N4 is a key part of the dye sensitized photocatalytic reaction, as generally considered for use in dye-sensitized solar cell systems.13 Smooth charge transfer from dye to dye would certainly enhance the photocatalytic activity, which was obviously lacking in the MgPc. To further improve the dye sensitized system, the selection of appropriate types and amounts of dye with good connectivity to the photocatalyst should be rigorously investigated.
4. Conclusions
Detailed studies were performed on photocatalytic hydrogen evolution on Pt/mpg-C3N4 photocatalyst modified with MgPc dye. Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution using MgPc/Pt/mpg-C3N4 from aqueous solution containing TEOA as a sacrificial reagent proceeded without deactivation, even under irradiation at wavelengths longer than 600 nm. A sufficient turnover number and the obtained action spectra confirmed that the H2 evolution was indeed photocatalytic. A monolayer of dye on the Pt/mpg-C3N4 photocatalyst gave the highest rate of H2 evolution, suggesting that charge transfer predominantly occurred through the conduction band of mpg-C3N4 to Pt, and the further accumulation of dye led to a decrease in the efficiency of charge transfer from MgPc to the conduction band of mpg-C3N4. To further improve the photocatalytic activity, smooth charge transfer of excited electrons from the dye to the photocatalyst and eventually to the cocatalysts is crucial.
