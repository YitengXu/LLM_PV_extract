Inheriting the native transition behaviour of the lanthanide ions, Ln3+ based nanomaterials have aroused great interest for a wide range of applications, including lighting and displays, optical fibers and amplifiers, responsive luminescent stains for biomedical analysis, in vivo and in vitro imaging, and enhancement for silicon solar cell devices. It should be noted that the application depends completely on the corresponding luminescent behaviour. To deepen the understanding of the luminescent mechanism is important for the developing of the field and the design of new Ln3+ based luminescent materials toward applications. In this review, we focused mainly on the recent developments on upconversion (UC) emission studies. Firstly, the emphasis was put on the introduction of basic luminescent properties of Ln3+ with f–f transitions, and then the corresponding mechanisms and properties of UC emission were discussed in detail, the potential researches with respect to UC mechanisms and properties were finally outlined.Hao DongHao Dong received his BSc degree from Zhengzhou University in 2012.

Introduction
Rare earth elements refer to the lanthanide family (from La to Lu) together with Sc and Y. With great similarity in their electron configuration, [Xe]4fn5dm6s2, Ln3+ exhibit similar physical and chemical properties, including the capability of giving out emissions through 4f–4f intra-configurational transitions. They are usually employed as the luminescent centers in molecular based functional materials and nanomaterials. Sc3+, Y3+, La3+ and Lu3+ are not taken into account due to the absence of unpaired 4f electrons, thus inorganic compounds containing the above four ions are frequently chosen as host materials. For luminescent ions from Ce3+ to Yb3+, the partially filled 4f shell is shielded by 5s25p6 sub-shells, resulting in intrinsic spectroscopic character with less interference from the chemical micro-surroundings. Furthermore, the shielding effect could also account for the narrow-band emission and long lifetimes of the excited states.1,2
Among the luminescent Ln3+, Ce3+ is a special example due to its broad f–d transitions which are distinct from the f–f transitions of most Ln3+. Fig. 1 presents the energy diagrams of Ln3+ in a LaCl3 lattice.3 The radiative transition between the energy levels is the basis for luminescent materials selection. It is apparent that a less nonradiative process is involved if the transition happens between a larger energy gap. However, due to the lack of adequate intermediate states, the radiation of Gd3+ locates at a shorter wavelength in the vacuum ultraviolet, and it is often employed as the host lattice instead of the luminescent center. On the contrary, energy gaps between Sm3+ (4f5), Eu3+ (4f6), Tb3+ (4f8), Dy3+ (4f9) and Ho3+(4f10) are larger but adequate, thus they could give out stronger emissions in the visible region. For Nd3+(4f3), Er3+(4f11), Tm3+(4f12), the radiation occurs in smaller energy gaps which correspond to the near infrared emission.

With progress on lanthanide luminescence and related luminescent materials investigations, f–f or f–d transitions under high energy photon excitation with fluorescence (FL) or quantum cutting (QC) processes are well established. FL refers to the process in which one higher-energy photon results in one lower-energy photon with a quantum efficiency lower than 100%. With the characteristics of monochromaticity, non-photoblinking, and stable chemical/physical properties, FL nanomaterials are common choices in lighting and displays, and alternatives to organic dyes and quantum dots in bio-applications.4–7 QC is a process in which an absorbed single photon splits into two lower-energy photons during the transition back to the ground state with a quantum efficiency above 100%, which was proposed in 1957 but first discovered in YF3:Pr3+ in 1974.8–10 UV-to-visible QC systems are usually applied for lighting and displays, while the visible-to-NIR QC systems are developed to enhance the performance of solar cells.11–14
The energy of emissive photons is usually lower than that of photons absorbed according to the aforementioned two mechanisms. However, some rare earth materials which are termed as upconversion (UC) materials were found to have distinct luminescent behaviour, in which higher-energy photons were emitted after the absorption of lower-energy photons. The UC process refers to nonlinear optical phenomenon in which continuous absorption of two or more photons leads to shorter-wavelength radiation via long-lived intermediate states (anti-Stokes emission). Initially, it was proposed conceptually by N. Bloembergen in 1959, as a process accomplished by successive absorption of two or more photons via excited states absorption (ESA).15 Another UC process was reported by Auzel in 1966,16 which was referred as the energy transfer UC (ETU). The photon avalanche (PA) was also demonstrated in Pr3+ based infrared quantum counters after the discovery of above two mechanisms.17 From then on, numerous researches have been conducted to realize the conversion of infrared radiation into the visible one.18–21
The research on UC emission is vigorous, especially in the interdisciplinary fields of biology and nanoscience, such as bio-imaging and detection. In these applications, luminescent properties of the UC nanomaterials are fundamental factors which would influence both the abilities of the materials and the final results. In this review, detailed UC mechanisms and progresses developed in recent years are discussed and summarized.
Mechanisms for UC emission
Attention should be paid to the difference between UC and other nonlinear optical processes, second harmonic generation (SHG) and the process of simultaneous two-photon absorption (STPA), in which the intermediate excited state is virtual (Fig. 2a and b). UC with real long-lived intermediate excited states could induce efficient upconversion of lower-energy photons into higher-energy ones (Fig. 2c–e).16,22
 Fig. 2  Principal UC processes for (a) second harmonic generation (SHG), (b) simultaneous two-photon absorption (STPA), (c) excited states absorption (ESA), (d) energy transfer UC (ETU), and (e) photon avalanche (PA). 
In a typical ESA process (Fig. 2c), transition from the ground state to a metastable intermediate state takes place after the absorption of one lower-energy photon, and then the excited electrons are promoted to a higher excited state after the absorption of a second pump photon. Finally, the UC emission happens when the electron drops back to the ground state in a radiative manner. The requirements for ESA are rigorous, such as the demand for the adequate population of the metastable intermediate state so as to capture the second photon, thus the excitation source should be provided with high pumping power and this is the reason why ESA is not easily observed.
Unlike ESA, ETU (Fig. 2d) is a process which is relatively easier to achieve. Two types of luminescent centers, which are usually called the sensitizer and activator, are embedded in the crystal matrix. Under the excitation of photons with lower energy, both the sensitizer and the activator would be excited. With the non-radiative energy transfer from the sensitizer to the adjacent activator, sequential absorption of the activators to the higher excited states takes place. Radiative emission could be observed as the activator returned to the ground state. For ESA systems, energy level matching together with an adequate spatial distance between the sensitizer and activator is required to accomplish highly efficient energy transfer.
PA (Fig. 2e) is an infrequent process on account of the requirement for high pumping intensity. PA begins with the population of intermediate excited state, followed by the population of higher energy levels through resonant ESA. After the metastable level population is finished, cross-relaxation energy transfer occurs between the excited ion and a neighbouring ground state ion, resulting in both ions occupying the intermediate levels. Thus the higher energy levels could be populated exponentially, yielding bright UC emission through radiation. PA is desirable for UC lasers and seldom discovered in UC nanomaterials.
Except for the mechanisms mentioned above, a novel UC mechanism named energy migration-mediated UC (EMU, Fig. 3) was proposed recently by Liu et al..23,24 Four types of Ln3+ were introduced to the EMU system at precisely defined concentrations through the rational design of a core–shell structure. Efficient UC emissions can be realized through energy transfer mediated by a gadolinium sublattice. The EMU process begins with the excitation energy transfer from sensitizer ion (I) to accumulator ion (II), followed by the energy migration from the high-lying excited state of accumulator ion (II) to the migrator ion (III). Finally, energy is trapped by the activator ion (IV) with the energy transfer via the migrator ion sublattice.
 Fig. 3  The proposed EMU scheme involving four types of ions and a rational core–shell design (core and shell regions are highlighted with different background colors). 
Because it is easier to achieve, ETU is the most frequently observed and developed in UC nanomaterials. Among the Ln3+, obviously, Yb3+ has the potential to serve as the sensitizer in ETU systems due to its unique and simple energy level with only one excited level of 2F5/2 (Fig. 1). With energy levels in a ladder-like arrangement, long lived excited states and excellent resonance with the transition (2F7/2 → 2F5/2) of Yb3+, Er3+, Ho3+ and Tm3+ (especially Er3+ and Tm3+) have been used as UC activators for decades.18,19 Actually, Er3+ shows particularly high UC efficiency among the three types of activators due to its similar sequential energy gap, namely between the 4I11/2 and 4I15/2 states and between the 4F7/2 and 4I11/2 states. As for the host materials, a series of compounds have been investigated, among which NaREF4 has been proved to be the optimal matrix to provide high efficient UC emissions due to the lower lattice phonon energy.22,25 There are two different phase constructions for NaREF4 nanocrystals, namely the cubic phase (α-phase) and hexagonal phase (β-phase). It is generally adopted that the crystal structure of the β-phase favours the emission of the dopant ions rather than that the α-phase, therefore Ln3+-doped β-NaREF4 should have a stronger luminescence intensity.
Yb3+–Er3+ dual ions activated systems
In Yb3+–Er3+ dual ions activated systems, green emissions at 525 and 543 nm together with red emissions at 655 nm are frequently observed characteristics. To determine the number of photons involved in the UC luminescent process, the relationship between UC luminescence intensity and the pumping power is often recorded as I–P curves, from which the slope represents the number of photons involved in the corresponding transition.26 UC mechanisms of NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocrystals with different size and phase construction were investigated systematically by our group.27
As shown in Fig. 4a, the UC luminescent intensity of both red and green curves increases linearly with the pumping power at relatively low excitation intensities after taking logarithms. The slopes are both approximately 2, indicating two-photon emission processes, however, a saturation effect takes place at relatively higher excitation intensity. In the two-photon mechanism (Fig. 4c), the 4S3/2 and 2H11/2 levels of Er3+ are populated through two-photon absorption and non-radiative relaxation with the energy migrated from adjacent Yb3+, yielding green emissions at 525 and 543 nm through 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transitions. On the other hand, the 4F9/2 level could also be populated in two ways, yielding red emissions at 655 nm through the transition of 4F9/2 → 4I15/2. Meanwhile, partially three-photon processes could also be observed at high pumping power in small sized β-NaREF4:Yb,Er nanocrystals (Fig. 4b). Although the green and red emissions were observed, the upconverted processes are assisted with the relaxation of 4I11/2 and 4F9/2. The whole process involved three photons as schematically illustrated in Fig. 4d, in which violet–blue emissions at 415 nm were also observed due to the transition of 2H9/2 → 4I15/2.

Yb3+–Tm3+ dual ions activated systems
The UC mechanism of Yb3+–Tm3+ dual ions activated β-NaREF4 nanocrystals has also been investigated comprehensively by our group.28 Under the excitation of a 980 nm laser, ultra-violet emissions at 360 nm, blue emissions at 450 and 475 nm, red emissions at 650 and 695 nm, and infrared emissions at 800 nm could be observed. From the I–P curves (Fig. 5a), it is not difficult to assign each emission into different multi-photon transition process. Emissions at 360 and 450 nm are four-photon processes, respectively attributed to the 1D2 → 3H6 and 1D2 → 3F4 transitions, while emissions at 475 and 650 nm are three-photon processes corresponding to the 1G4 → 3H6 and 1G4 → 3F4 transitions, respectively. Emissions at 695 and 800 nm are two-photon processes due to the transitions of 3F2 → 3H6 and 3H4 → 3H6 separately. Similarly, the UC saturation effect concerned with the intermediate levels of Yb3+ and Tm3+ (esp. 2F5/2 of Yb3+, 1D2, 1G4 and 3H4 of Tm3+) have also been observed when the excitation power intensity increased to a certain value, which has been demonstrated to be easily affected by heating effects of the NIR laser beam by Hewes and Sarver29

Adapted from ref. 28. 
Even though Yb3+ has been introduced as the sensitizer, UC efficiency is far away from satisfactory on account of the parity-forbidden 4f–4f transitions, low absorption cross-sections and non-radiative process induced by quenching of the high-frequency vibration of surface ligands, such as hydroxyl groups. Therefore, numerous researches have been focused on enhancing the UC emissions. On the other hand, the colour output is also of vital importance due to the direct influence on the property and the application value of UC nanomaterials. Hence, a lot of works have also been made on the modulation of the colour outputs of UC nanomaterials so as to fulfil various applications.
Enhancement for UC emissions
To further enhance UC emission, a few methods had been developed and could be summarized as antenna ligand sensitization, the formation of a core–shell structure, the introduction of non-Ln3+ ions and the incorporation of noble-metals as shown in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  Principle concept of various methods to enhance the UC luminescence: antenna ligands sensitization (a); formation of core–shell structure (b); introduction of non-Ln3+ ions (c); different incorporation with noble metals (d). From left-to-right in (d) are: direct coating with noble metal shell; indirect coating with the introduction of a intermediate inert shell; assembly with noble metal nanowires; and a trilayered structure of UC layer–inert layer–noble metal layer. 
Antenna ligands
Except for the co-doped sensitizer Yb3+, antenna ligands have also been selected to enlarge the absorption cross-sections of activators. With appropriate energy absorption, π–π* transition and the following singlet state population, triplet state population through intersystem crossing occurred. The triplet state could lead to the population of emissive f excited states through Förster-type dipole–dipole exchange.30 With optimization of the fluorescence of the dye to match the absorption of Yb3+ in NIR, the absorptivity of the UC process is greatly increased, and the overall UC efficiency is enhanced. Recently, Jan C. Hummelen et al. have successfully developed an organic near-infrared dye sensitized β-NaYF4:Yb,Er nanomaterial; the overall UC is dramatically enhanced by a factor of ∼3300 (Fig. 7).31 Thanks to the absorption of the dye molecules, the excitation of the dye-sensitized UC is further tuned to a shorter wavelength.

Core–shell structure
Luminescent ions located on the surface of nanocrystals show distinct surface effects. The surface ions have a less symmetric crystal field than that of the bulk, and they are exposed directly to the solvent molecules. The surface defect could lead to nonradiative irradiation and the surrounding high-frequency vibration groups like hydroxyl could also quench the UC emission. A facile way to enhance greatly the UC luminescence is the formation of a core–shell structure.27,32,33 Typically, Liu's group have designed a NaGdF4:Yb,Tm@NaGdF4 core–shell structure, and presented direct evidence for the surface quenching effect associated with the size-dependent luminescence UC nanoparticles.34 They introduced the inert NaGdF4 thin-shell to preserve the optical integrity of the nanoparticles and greatly minimized the surface quenching-induced emission losses. An homogeneous shell with the same structure as the core is easy to developed on the surface of NaREF4. From the same group, an optically inert NaYF4 shell was introduced epitaxially around an Ln3+-doped NaGdF4@NaGdF4 core–shell structure to prevent surface quenching of the excitation energy.24 Innovatively, we have employed CaF2 as the outer shell to enhance the luminescence of inner cubic NaYF4:Yb,Er (Tm/Ho) core by ca. 300 times and also to reduce the release of RE3+in vivo (Fig. 8).35 Guo et al. and van Veggle et al. have reported separately great luminescence enhancement after the introduction of a β-NaGdF4 shell with the capability for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast measurement.36,37

Introduction of non-Ln3+ ions
Since the main intra-4f electronic-dipole transitions of Ln3+ are forbidden, the quantum efficiency is usually restricted at a low level. However, this disadvantage is expected to be broken by the tailoring of the local crystal field through introducing other non-Ln3+ ions. With relatively smaller cationic radius, Li+ is supposed to be a superb choice for tailoring the local crystal field of luminescent Ln3+ through occupying the interstitial sites in the host lattice. A series of works have been conducted to introduce Li+ into the Yb3+–Er3+ dual-ion activated UC systems, including Y2O3;Yb,Er,38 ZnO:Yb,Er,39 BaTiO3:Yb,Er,40 NaYF4:Yb,Er41 and NaGdF4:Yb,Er.42 In these systems, the lifetime of the intermediate states 4I11/2 (Er3+) and 2F5/2 (Yb3+) is prolonged with the distortion of the local asymmetry of the activator, and is important for the green emission together with the population of the 4S3/2 level. Efficient energy back transfer (EBT) 4S3/2(Er3+) + 2F7/2(Yb3+) → 4I13/2(Er3+) + 2F5/2(Yb3+) and cross relaxation (CR) 2H11/2(Er3+) + 2I15/2(Er3+) → 4I9/2(Er3+) + 4I13/2(Er3+) processes would take place for the population of the 4I13/2 level of Er3+, which could further populate the 4F9/2 level for enhancement of the red emission. Similar enhancement effects were found. With the increased concentration of Li+, UC emission reaches its maximum, and further increase of Li+ would reduce the emission (Fig. 9). For Er3+ activated UC emission, not only is the improvement of the visible emission reported, enhanced multiphoton processes which gives out ultraviolet and blue emissions have also been studied.43 Enhancement effects have been found in Yb3+–Ho3+,44 Yb3+–Tm3+ (ref. 45) and Yb3+–Er3+–Tm3+ (ref. 46) activated systems. Without the co-doping of Yb3+, the enhancement could also be observed in solely activator-doped systems by introduction of Li+.47–51 Similarly, Bi3+ has also been selected to lower the local symmetry of luminescence centers so as to enhance the UC emissions.52 In their work, Bi3+ was found to be more prominent in symmetry breaking than Li+ with the same doping amount, thus more obvious enhancement was observed in Bi3+ doped systems.

The inset shows the integral intensity of green and red emission as a function of the concentration of Li+ (a). Proposed UC mechanism for the green and red emissions of NaGdF4:Yb,Er,Li (b). Adapted from ref. 42. 
Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that significantly enhanced UC emissions could be also be observed in transition metal ion (such as Mn2+ and Mo2+) doped YbAG:Yb,Er nanomaterials, where the sensitization was achieved through energy transfer from the Yb3+–Mo2+/Mn2+ ionic pair to the activator.53,54
Incorporation with noble metal
The enhancement effect when UC nanocrystals approach the noble metals could be attributed to two possible mechanisms. For one thing, the enhancement effect may be achieved as a result of the amplification of the local incident electromagnetic field, which arises from the coupling with the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of noble metals. For another, the increase of the radiative decay rate, arising from the resonance of the emission from luminescent centers with the SPR of noble metals, could also account for the enhancement effect as well as the improvement of quantum efficiency. It should be noted that the quenching effect could also be observed for the latter case.
Commonly, Au and Ag are frequently employed for the enhancement of UC luminescence. We have proposed the assembly of Ag nanowires and NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocrystals, and the enhancement of the UC luminescence was obviously observed by a factor of 2.3 and 3.7 for green and red emissions, respectively (Fig. 10).55 Very recently, a core–shell structure of NaYF4:Yb,Er@SiO2@Ag was designed by Xu et al.56 The separation distance between Ag and the UC nanoparticles was demonstrated to be of vital importance for the extent of the enhancement effect, and the optimum separation distance was determined to be 10 nm. The maximum enhancement factors were 14.4 and 10.8 respectively, when 15 and 30 nm Ag nanoparticles were used. Similarly, a trilayered structure of noble metal-oxide (Al2O3)-UC nanocrystals have been reported by investigation of the relationship between the precisely controlled oxide spacer thickness and the enhanced UC luminescence.57 The results showed that UC luminescence was strongly dependent on the thickness of the oxide spacer and the type of noble metal, and enhancements of up to 5.2-fold for Au and 45-fold for Ag nanoparticles were reported. Beyond that, direct coating with an Au nanoshell,58–60 indirect coating with an inert SiO2 shell and then the Au nanoshell,61 Au island films62 and Au surfaces63 have also been demonstrated the feasibility of enhancement of Yb3+ sensitized UC emissions through plasmon interactions. Interestingly, single NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocrystals and gold nanospheres assembled in a combined confocal and atomic force microscope setup; an overall enhancement factor of 3.8 was achieved.64 Very recently, Tahir and his coworkers have confirmed that Ag nanoparticles are also capable of enhancing the UC emission of the solely Er3+-activated system under the excitation of 797 nm. It is proposed that the local field effect from Ag nanoparticles is responsible for the emission enhancement.65

Modulation of UC emissions
From the mechanisms mentioned above, green and red emissions are often simultaneously obtained in Yb3+–Er3+ co-doped systems with an overall yellow output. Yellow and blue colors are commonly observed in Yb3+–Ho3+ and Yb3+–Tm3+ co-doped systems. Hence, fine tuning the color output is of vital importance to meet the requirements of various applications, such as light emitting displays and multiplexed biological labeling. Methods to modulate the UC emissions mainly focused on the control of concentration and combination of dopant Ln3+ ions, the introduction of non-Ln3+ ions, and the fabrication with noble metals/quantum dots/organic dyes. Others, like the control of the particle size and the altering of host lattice, have also proven feasible for changing the original color output.
Controlling the dopant concentration and combination of Ln3+ ions
UC emissions vary with the concentration and combination of dopant ions which determine the number of luminescent centers as well as their spatial distance in the inorganic host lattice. Typically, a relatively increased red emission could be observed by increasing the dopant concentration of Yb3+ at a fixed concentration of Er3+,27,66,67 while the NIR UC emission was also found to increase with the increased concentration of Yb3+ with Tm3+ activator.68 Liu's group has introduced an increasing dopant concentration of Yb3+ (25–60%) into the NaYF4 host lattice and realized fine-tuning of the color output from yellow to red.69 With increasing dopant concentration of Yb3+, Yb3+–Er3+ inter-atomic distance was decreased, facilitating the EBT from Er3+ to Yb3+, thus excited levels of 2H9/2, 2H11/2, and 4S3/2 of Er3+ were depopulated, weakening the violet–blue and green emissions. Furthermore, by introducing two activators (Tm3+ and Er3+), a tunable color output from blue to white could be realized (Fig. 11).

Recently, Emory M. Chan et al. have applied a combinatorial method to identify a series of doubly and triply doped upconverting nanoparticles that exhibit narrow, spectrally pure emission spectra at various visible wavelengths through mutual energy migration.70 In their research, spectrally pure red emission was observed in an Er3+–Tm3+ co-doped system. Similarly, enhanced red emission was also demonstrated in an Er3+–Tm3+ co-doped NaYF4 phosphor by Qin's group.71 Beyond the co-doping of Er3+–Tm3+, other Ln3+ like Ce3+ and Gd3+ have also been separately introduced into Yb3+–Ho3+ and Yb3+–Er3+/Tm3+ systems by Li et al. to investigate the change of emissions.72
Due to the characteristic green, red and blue color outputs observed in Yb3+–Er3+ and Yb3+–Tm3+ co-doped systems, a white UC emission phosphor, useful for high resolution displays and white light based LEDs, is thought to be achievable through the Yb3+–Er3+–Tm3+ tri-doped systems. To name only a few, NaYF4,73 Y2O3,74,75 Lu2O3,76 Y2BaZnO5,77 Gd4O3F6 (ref. 78) and BaYF5 (ref. 79) were all taken into account as the host material to obtain a white emitting phosphor through tri-doping of Yb3+–Er3+–Tm3+ ions.
Introduction of non-Ln3+ ions
In recent years, several transition metal ions with higher energy levels have been introduced into lanthanide doped nanomaterials (typically the Yb3+–Er3+ systems), as a result, distinct luminescent properties with nearly single-band emission were discovered. As transition metal ions are introduced, d energy levels participate in the energy migration with lanthanide ions so as to control the population of different excited states of lanthanide activators.
Liu et al. have developed a single-band emission system containing Yb3+ and Er3+, in which KMnF3 was employed as the host matrix instead of NaYF4.80 In this design, spectrally pure red emission (4F9/2 → 4I15/2) is ascribed to the nonradiative energy transfer from the 2H9/2 and 4S3/2 levels of Er3+ to the 4T1 level of Mn2+, followed by EBT to the 4F9/2 level of Er3+. With the EBT from Mn2+, spectrally pure red and NIR emissions have also been observed in KMnF3:Yb,Ho and KMnF3:Yb,Tm nanocrystals, respectively (Fig. 12). Similarly, with the participation of Mn2+ in the process of energy transfer, nearly pure red emissions have also been discovered in NaMnF3:Yb,Er81 and NaYF4:Mn,Yb,Er82 systems. Except for the red emission, nearly pure green emission could also be obtained with the introduction of Mn2+ into Er3+-YbAG nanocrystals, where the population in the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 was achieved through energy transfer from the Yb3+–Mn2+ ionic pair.54 Similarly, the Mo2+–Yb3+ ionic pair has also proven to possess the ability to sensitize the green and blue emissions significantly in Er3+–Mo3+–YbAG and Tm3+–Mo3+–YbAG nanocrystals.53 Li+ has also been selected and introduced into the GdF3:Yb,Er host lattice to occupy the interstitial sites, leading to the tailoring of the local crystal field and changing of the distance between Yb3+ and Er3+. As a result, red emission was enhanced through the transition from the saturated 4F9/2 level.83

Fluorescence resonance energy transfer
Except for the altering of the dopants, UC emissive nanomaterials have also been frequently fabricated with noble metals, quantum dots, and organic molecules for modulation of UC emissions based on the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) process. In FRET systems, UC nanomaterials usually serve as the energy donors while the introduced components act as the energy acceptors. Li and his coworkers have introduced 7 nm Au nanoparticles to UC nanomaterials and successfully obtained a promising sensor for the detection of avidin.84 Zhang et al. have encapsulated organic dyes and quantum dots into the silica shell coated on the NaYF4:Yb,Er/Tm core.85 Multicolored UC emissions were generated after the introduction of organic dyes and quantum dots through a FRET process, and these materials would be useful for bio-related studies. Zhang and his coworkers have constructed a novel sensor for the simultaneous determination of OTA and FB1, which is applied to detect two types of mycotoxins simultaneously by using a multiplexed FRET.86 The FRET process occurred from multicolor BaYF5:Yb,Er/Tm to graphene oxide (GO). The UC emissions are completely quenched by the GO through FRET. However, if mycotoxins exist, GO would be far away from the UC nanocrystals due to the strong binding of aptamers and their corresponding mycotoxins. Liu's group have modulated the UC emissions through functionalization of the UC nanoparticle by an amphiphilic polymer, which was loaded with fluorescent and quenching molecules by physical absorption.87In vivo five-color UC imaging using UC nanoparticles and dye-loaded UC nanoparticles (UCNP1, UCNP2, UCNP1/RhB, UCNP1/R6G and UCNP1/TQ1) were achieved (Fig. 13). Moreover, we have employed photochromic dyes to regulate the UC emission of UC nanoparticles.88,89 Different ratios of UC nanomaterials to noble metal nanoparticles90 and their assembly at different pH91 could lead to fine-tuned UC emissions from red to green in NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocrystals.

Others
Many researches have been conducted and have proven the dependence of UC emissions on the particle size. We have reported the different red-to-green emission ratio of different sized NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocrystals.27 Capobianco and his coworkers have found enhanced red emission in nanocrystalline Y2O3:Yb,Er compared with the bulk particles.67 Gao et al. have employed YOF as the host matrix and successfully got red-emitting nanocrystals with the composition of YOF:Yb,Er@YOF.92 It has been demonstrated that the as-prepared UC nanomaterials annealed at different temperature could affect the crystal phase and the distribution of Er3+, thus spectral red emission is possible.93,94
Application of UC nanomaterials
Since rare earth UC nanomaterials are able to produce narrow-band emissions with higher energy after the excitation by continuous-wave near infrared lasers, they are endowed with large anti-Stokes shifts and less possibility for spectral overlapping. Furthermore, with the advantages including less toxicity, high signal-to-noise ratio, remarkable penetration depth, and excellent chemical and thermal stability, UC nanocrystals are promising materials for bio-imaging applications.4,95,96 Various in vitro and in vivo biological models have been chosen to test and verify the imaging ability of lanthanide doped UC nanomaterials.97–100 Coupled with UC imaging, multifunctional nanomaterials have aroused much interest for realization of synergetic effects. To name only a few, Li's group have successfully combined UC imaging together with MRI and PET imaging.101,102 We have designed triple-functional core–shell structured NaGdF4:Yb,Er@CaF2@SiO2-PS nanoparticles to realize the UC/MRI/PDT together.103 Liu et al. have assembled IONPs on the surface of β-NaYF4:Yb,Er UC nanoparticles by electrostatic attraction. An Au shell was formed on the surface, forming a UC/PTT/magnetic targeted nanocomposice.104 Except for the application of bio-imaging, UC nanomaterials could also act as candidates for bioassays and therapy.105 With two different transitions of 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2, the green emissions show two peaks at 525 and 543 nm, respectively. Interestingly, the two peaks exhibit different area ratios at different temperature, thus UC nanomaterials have also been developed as temperature sensor with high sensitivity (Fig. 14).53,106,107 Our group presented a recording medium for rewritable optical storage by combing UC nanomaterials with photochromic dyes.88,89 Moreover, UC materials have also been used to enhance the performance of silicon solar cells,13 and for metal ion detection,108 and so on.

Conclusion and perspective
This review has mainly described the UC emission mechanisms and behavior of rare earth nanomaterials. A lot of research has been conducted to make use of UC luminescence, and a series of prominent results have been reported. However, better UC materials with higher quantum yield are still in demand. Firstly, highly efficient long-wavelength emissions are required for bio-applications, and the introduction of proper transition metal ions into lanthanide based nanomaterials is also feasible and promising for the modulation of UC luminescence. Furthermore, the quantum efficiency of UC nanomaterials is still unsatisfactory; effective methods based on antenna ligands or interaction with metal nanostructures should be developed to broaden the application of UC emissions. Last but not least, the vast majority of the reported nanomaterials with UC emissions focused on Yb3+ sensitized systems. However, the heating effect induced by continuous high-power irradiation with the 980 nm laser should be taken into consideration. UC nanomaterials excited by an alternative continuous-wave laser with a much lesser heating effect are expected to meet the demand of corresponding bio-applications in the near future.
