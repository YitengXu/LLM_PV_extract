    , Accepted 31st January 2017First published on 1st February 2017AbstractThe geometry of organic π-conjugated small molecules can impact the morphology of blended-thin films and subsequent performance in opto-electronic devices. In this report, we investigate the role of molecular conformation of perylene diimide (PDI) dimers designed to act as non-fullerene acceptors in organic solar cells. A series of three PDI dimers is presented in which the PDI chromophores are directly linked via the bay position (PDI2, 3) or separated by one (PDI2Ac, 4) or two (PDI2Ac2, 5) acetylene spacers. In all cases, the exo-position of the PDI dimers is N-annulated. New compounds 4 and 5 were synthesized via an optimized and facile synthetic pathway. Directly linked PDI dimers adopted a highly twisted conformation whereas adding two acetylene spacers rendered the PDI chromophores coplanar. 1H NMR spectroscopic analysis of each dimer revealed a highly sensitive electronic structure that is strongly influenced by the acetylene spacers. It was found that compounds 4 and 5 with less twisted structures exhibited similar electron affinities but lower ionization potentials, lower organic solvent solubility, and red-shifted optical absorption spectra when compared to the highly twisted dimer 3. In addition, 4 and 5 showed a stronger tendency to aggregate in both solution and the solid state. This had a large impact on the performance of organic solar cells using these materials as electron acceptors. Bulk-heterojunction solar cells based upon a PTB7-Th:3 active layer could reach high power conversion efficiencies of 5.23%. In contrast, PTB7-Th:4 and PTB7-Th:5 based devices had ∼5 times lower performance owing to the formation of unfavourable active layer morphologies.
Introduction
The development of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) for use in organic solar cells (OSCs) has become one of the hottest topics in materials science over the past few years.1–5 Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs based on NFAs have risen beyond 8% and rival the best devices using the classic [6,6]-phenylC71butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) fullerene acceptor.6–13 This remarkable performance can be attributed to innovative NFA design, careful device fabrication, and strategic donor selection. With respect to the former, an effective strategy to realize high performance NFAs has been to construct linear, dendritic, or polymer materials using electron deficient organic dyes and/or polycyclic aromatic building blocks. For example, rhodanine,14–16 diketopyrrolopyrrole,17–20 isoindigo,21–23 naphthalimide,24–28 and perylene diimide (PDI)29 are examples of ‘electron deficient’ building blocks used to create NFAs. Such strategies allow for the NFAs to exhibit strong visible light absorption to complement that of the donor materials, precisely controlled electronic energy levels to maximize the efficiency of electron transfer and transport processes, and tailored solubility to allow for solution processing.30,31 Of the myriad of materials explored, those based upon the PDI molecule are among the highest performing and most intensely studied.29,32 PDI itself has strong visible light absorption from 400–600 nm, a high electron affinity making it a good electron acceptor, a large delocalized aromatic backbone that favors efficient intermolecular stacking enabling rapid electron transport, and can be readily functionalized to tune physical and electronic properties.29,33 Both polymeric34 and small molecule10,11,35,36 PDI based materials have found utility as acceptors in high performance OSC devices.37 Within the realm of small molecule acceptors based on the PDI chromophore, the concept of oligomeric PDI materials with conformationally twisted structures, i.e. PDI subunits that are non-planar with each other, has become popular to achieve high PCE. The thought is that the ‘twisted’ structure disfavors strong aggregation of the PDI molecules allowing for a more suitable intermixed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) morphology with a given donor molecule.1,38–41 Alternatively, the extent of aggregation is often controlled by careful selection of casting conditions, which may be detrimental to the scale up of BHJ devices.42
Considering alignment of PDI acceptor subunits in a twisted (non-planar) configuration with respect to one another is a popular strategy for improving the morphology in BHJs, we were surprised to find that there was no direct investigation into the effect of the dihedral angle between PDI chromophores on the solution and solid state properties (though other systems have been studied).35,43,44 A study on the effect of changes in the molecular structure of PDI dimers on solution and solid state properties is especially crucial due to the unpredictability of film morphology45,46 and the high sensitivity of the optical absorption and charge transport properties to the packing arrangements of PDI based materials.47 In order to probe the effect of the twist angle on physical properties we designed three dimers, based on an N-annulated PDI monomer previously synthesized by our group,48 which range from fully twisted to coplanar (see Fig. 1). The N-annulation is a beneficial moiety because it adds a synthetic handle to tune solubility and self-assembly49,50 as well as blocks two bay positions which allows for facile monofunctionalization of the PDI core. Acetylene was chosen as a spacer as it can be installed without the use of directing groups and has been shown to relieve steric hindrance and allow for less disordered structures while minimally altering the electronic properties.24,51,52
 Fig. 1  Chemical structures of the three PDI based organic small molecule acceptors compared in this study. The directly bound PDI dimer has been previously reported by our group and is included for comparison. The two acetylene linked PDI dimers are novel with full synthetic details and characterization reported in this paper. 
Results and discussion
Synthesis
In the realm of organic electronics, careful design, facile synthesis, and high material purity have become very important as various technologies are reaching the point of commercialization.53–57 Our research group has had a long standing interest in the practical synthesis of organic functional materials,23,51,58,59 and herein we have optimized the synthetic routes towards the target compounds and all precursors. In particular, we have identified residual palladium metal as a culprit for inefficient reactions involving the synthesis of target compounds 4 and 5. Use of silica supported catalysts and/or silica based metal scavengers were found to be critical to achieving high reaction yields.60–64 The optimized high yielding reaction pathways towards all compounds is shown in Fig. 2. Full synthetic details and product identification can be found in the ESI.†

Precursor 1 and target 3 were prepared via a facile and scalable synthetic procedure described previously by our group.48 Precursors 1a, and 2, and targets 4 and 5 were synthesized via reaction pathways optimized from those previously reported for the construction of related PDI-acetylene compounds.65 Compound 1a was synthesized via the Sonogashira reaction between 1 and trimethylsilyl (TMS) acetylene. Using diisopropylamine as the solvent and a Pd(PPh3)4/CuI catalyst system, we obtained 1a with an isolated yield of 98%. The subsequent deprotection of 1a to form 2 was found to be sensitive to the amount of Pd remaining in the sample. All attempts to remove the TMS protecting group resulted in low isolated yields of 2 owing to the formation of the diyne 5 mediated by residual Pd.66 This was confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S8, ESI†). We have identified two methods to minimize palladium contamination in 1a and obtain high yields of 2. First, the synthesis of 1a can be carried out using the heterogeneous catalyst Siliacat® DPP-Pd which reduces Pd leaching into the product,58 but lower product yields are obtained owing to a more sluggish reaction. Second, compound 1a, obtained in near quantitative yield using Pd(PPh3)4, can be treated with the heterogeneous metal scavenger, SiliametS® DMT to removal all traces of Pd. We found the second method more practical owing to the higher product yields obtained (see ESI† for full details). Thus using Pd free starting material, compound 2 was synthesized in high yield using a standard basic deprotection protocol.65 The target alkyne based dimer 4 was synthesized via Sonogashira coupling of bromide 1 with acetylene 2. We found that for our system, the literature conditions of Pd(PPh3)4 and CuI in triethylamine resulted in a low yield of 25%.65 Changing the solvent mixture to 10% diisopropylamine in a toluene mixture increased the solubility of all reagents, and subsequently increased the product yield to 60%.
The final target 5 was synthesized via Glaser homocoupling of 2. Following the literature conditions using the (Pd(PPh3)2Cl2)/CuI catalyst system with benzoquinone as stoichiometric oxidant, resulted in a yield of 40%.65 Having observed that the deprotection of 1a lead to the homocoupled product (5) when 1a was contaminated with palladium, we decided to attempt the homocoupling under conditions similar to the deprotection. We found that using a Pd(PPh3)4/CuI catalyst system in 1:1 MeOH:CHCl3 with ambient oxygen as oxidant improved product yield, but residual PPh3 proved difficult to remove. By simply switching from Pd(PPh3)4 to Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 were we able to obtain analytically pure 5 in yields as high as 71%. It is important to note that for the formation of 5 in high yields, O2, Pd, and Cu are required (see Fig. S9, ESI†).
Theoretical analysis
In order to confirm our hypothesis that adding acetylene spacers between the two PDI chromophores reduces the twisting angle, we evaluated the structures using density functional theory (DFT) analysis utilizing Gaussian 09.67 DFT calculations are widely used to help understand the geometry and electronic properties of π-conjugated organic small molecules.22,68 For 3, 4, and 5 the ground state molecular geometries as well as predicted optical and electronic properties were optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory (for full predicted optical and electronic details see Fig. S10, ESI†). As is shown in Fig. 3, the dihedral angle is highly dependent on the spacing between PDI chromophores. With directly linked 3, the PDI chromophores are nearly orthogonal to each other with a dihedral angle of 96°. By separating the PDI chromophores with one acetylene spacer, the steric interactions are reduced and the PDI chromophores are twisted with a dihedral angle of 144°. By separating the PDI chromophores with two acetylene spacers, the PDI chromophores are sufficiently far apart for the steric interactions between the PDI subunits to become negligible compared to conjugative effects and they are therefore coplanar. Calculations for all three show a slight destabilizing effect on the HOMO and a slight stabilizing effect on the LUMO, due to acetylene, leading to a net narrowing of the bandgap. Thus, the acetylene spacers are predicted to play a crucial role in controlling the angle between the PDI chromophores.

1H NMR spectroscopic analysis
Analysis of the 1H NMR spectra of compounds 3, 4, and 5 show some interesting trends as the space between PDI chromophores is increased. As the three compounds are separated by only acetylene spacers, changes to the 1H NMR spectra are due to changes in the steric and electronic environment of the protons, with no extraneous signals in any compound. As shown in Fig. 4 the spectra of each compound exhibits three singlets (H-atoms A–C) and two doublets (H-atoms D and E). As the PDI chromophores are separated, the singlet resonances begin to coalesce. The similarity of the chemical shifts as the PDI units become further apart is a result of reduced inductive coupling between the PDI chromophores. Since each proton responsible for the singlet resonances (H-atoms A, B, and C) are at different distances from the linked PDI (3, 7, or 8 bonds) their signals are affected by varying degrees; directly showing the differences in the electronic environment of the PDI as a function of separation. The changes in chemical shifts of protons D and E are, however, more indicative of the steric environment. For compound 3, H-atoms D and E are predicted (by DFT, vide supra) to be directly above the plane of the opposing PDI chromophore. The positioning of these protons above the aromatic system is expected to have a dramatic shielding effect, resulting from the aromatic ring currents, which should not be observed in the less twisted 4 and 5. In the 1H NMR spectra of 3, resonances for H-atoms D and E are upfield from 7.6–7.9 ppm. Incorporation of the acetylene spacers reduces the steric strain between the PDI chromophores and as a result, the resonances for H-atoms D and E are shifted downfield. Owing to the large changes in the 1H NMR chemical shifts when comparing compounds 3, 4, and 5, we can conclude that the relative position of the PDI chromophores to one another has a dramatic influence on the overall electronic properties.

Physical properties
With purified final compounds in hand, we set out to determine some of their basic physical properties. Firstly, melting points and thermal stability was measured. Thermal stability is a critical factor for materials to be used in electronic devices which may experience moderately high temperatures within an operational device. We found all final compounds to remain as solids to temperatures exceeding 300 °C. Compound 4 was found to have the highest melting point (>400 °C) which is significantly higher than 3 which melts at 380 °C and 5 at 337–339 °C. The anomalously high melting point for 4 may indicate stronger intermolecular forces and presents as increased crystallinity as determined by thin film X-ray diffraction on dropcast films when compared to 5 (see Fig. S16, ESI†). These melting points are significantly higher than those for the non N-annulated PDI acetylene dimers.65
We also found that 3, 4, and 5 are thermally stable to 425, 410, and 380 °C respectively (Fig. S11, ESI†). Particularly interesting is compound 5 which exhibits a decomposition temperature significantly lower than that of 3 and 4. We believe that this is due to the decomposition of the diacetylene linker which corresponds to about 4% of the molecular mass which is consistent with TGA results (see Fig. S11, ESI†).
The solubility of all compounds were determined in CHCl3 and C6H5Cl, both common processing solvents for OSCs. Compound 3 was found to be highly soluble in both solvents at concentrations exceeding 50 mg mL−1. Similar to 3, the solubility of compound 4 was determined to be >50 mg mL−1 in CHCl3 while the solubility of 5 in CHCl3 was found to be slightly less at ∼43 mg mL−1. Strikingly, both compounds 4 and 5 had considerably lower solubilities in C6H5Cl, with 4 being hardly soluble at all. Previously we made a similar observation with monomeric PDI acceptors, where solubilities in C6H5Cl was poor.31 It is unclear to us as to why certain PDI molecules do not interact with C6H5Cl solvent molecules well, but of high interest is that the fully twisted PDI dimer 3 appears to be unique in having a general high solubility in a range of solvents. Ultimately the large differences observed here (summarized in Table 1) will affect the formation thin-films and solar cell devices.

Electronic characterization
The electrochemical properties of compounds 3, 4, and 5 were examined via CV, UPS, and IPES to determine electronic energy levels and further probe the effect of acetylene spacer (see Fig. 5 and Table 2). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements showed that each compound exhibited multiple reversible reduction waves, typical of PDI based materials.39,65,69,70 The onset of reduction for all three compounds were found to both occur at ∼−1 V with respect to ferrocene. From this value and using a conversion factor of 4.8,71 the electron affinity (EA) was estimated to be 3.8 eV. The lack of change in reduction onset shows that as predicted the acetylene linker acts successfully as an electronically neutral linker, neither donating nor withdrawing electrons from the PDI chromophore.51,52 We were unable to accurately determine the ionization energies of 4 and 5 due to irreversible oxidation waves. To gain further insight into the energetics of the three PDI materials and to better understand the effect of intermolecular aggregation we performed ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and inverse photoelectron spectroscopy (IPES) on thin films of 3, 4, and 5. The ionization energies (IE) for 3, 4, and 5 were determined to be 6.05, 5.84, and 5.98 eV, respectively. Compound 4 has a lower IE than 3 by approximately 210 meV and 140 meV lower than 5. This is consistent with the thin-film optical bandgaps where compound 4 shows a considerable redshift and lowest bandgap, which is attributed to aggregation of the dimer and strong intermolecular electronic coupling (vide infra). The IPES spectra for all three compounds overlap with each other within 100 meV and thus the trend in the valence band positions dictates the size of the transport gap which is in agreement with trends in optical gaps seen in the UV-visible spectra.

Optical characterization
To further determine the effect of the acetylene spaces on the electronic properties of the dimeric PDI species the optical absorption and emission spectra of the PDI dimers in solution and as thin-films were obtained (Fig. 6, Table 3). In CHCl3 solution, all three dimers show very high absorption from 450–600 nm which is characteristic of PDI chromophores.39,65,70,72,73 Compound 3 exhibits an absorption onset at 580 nm, a low energy absorption band with vibronic coupling (534 and 498 nm), and a small higher energy shoulder at 468 nm. Strikingly, the absorption profiles of 4 and 5 are vastly different from that of 3. Compounds 4 and 5 have optical absorption spectra redshifted relative to 3 with onsets of 610 and 600 nm, respectively. These redshifts can be attributed to a larger π-conjugated backbone as well as a less twisted conjugated structure afforded by the acetylene spacers. The major low energy absorptions bands for compounds 4 and 5 exhibit vibronic coupling (ca. ∼510 and ∼540 nm) and a low energy shoulder at ∼600 nm. The lowest energy band is most pronounced for 4. This additional low energy shoulder is likely due to increased electronic coupling between the two PDI chromophores and has been observed in related materials with fused11,40,74 or acetylene65 linked PDI molecules. In addition, a large high energy band appears at ∼350 nm for both 4 and 5. This high energy band arises from electronic transitions within the acetylene spacers as it increases with increasing number of acetylene groups. Comparing each band shows a definite bathochromic shift with the increase in conjugation length. The 0–0 band at 534 nm in 3 is shifted by ∼10 nm with each additional acetylene linker to 548 nm in 4 and 556 nm in 5. In a similar manner the 0–1 transition occurs at 498, 512, and 522 nm for 3, 4, and 5 respectively. Each band is bathochromically shifted with each additional acetylene linker, and this bathochromic shift is consistent with an increasingly extended conjugated molecule. The relative intensity of the 0–0 and 0–1 bands is different for 3, 4, and 5. For compound 3 and 4 the maximum absorption is the 0–0 band at 534 nm with a molar absorptivity of 95000 M−1 cm−1 and at 548 nm with a molar absorptivity of 82000 M−1 cm−1, respectively. Compound 5, however has the maximum absorption at the 0–1 band at 522 nm with a molar absorptivity of 85000 M−1 cm−1.

Upon transitioning from solution to the thin-film, large changes are observed in the optical absorption spectra. For each compound the absorption profile is broadened and bathochromically shifted relative to the solution profile (Fig. 6). Compound 3 has only a very small change in the vibronic coupling and a small shoulder arises likely due to intermolecular coupling in the solid state. Compound 4 exhibits the largest changes; the vibronically coupled peaks both redshift, though the 0–0 shifts more, leading to increased splitting of the 0–0 and 0–1 bands. Additionally, a new band is seen at 615 nm, likely due to intermolecular coupling between π-stacked PDI chromophores. Compound 5 shows optical properties similar to 3. Much like 3, 5 has a broadening of the absorption in transitioning from solution to thin film. Notably the 0–1 peak increases in intensity relative to the 0–0 peak which is typically indicative of order in PDI chromophores.75 The photoluminescence (PL) of all compounds in solution and as thin-films is also shown in Fig. 6. Not unlike related PDI compounds the PL profiles mirrors that of the optical absorption. Full data is tabulated in Table 3.
Solution aggregation dynamics
Owing to the vastly different optical absorption spectra and solubility of 3, 4, and 5, we have probed the aggregation behaviour of each material in solution. To determine the effect and extent of aggregation, we dissolved each in CHCl3 and added small amounts of a poor solvent to induce aggregation, in this case MeOH was chosen as a ‘poor solvent’ since none of the compounds exhibited any solubility in it. 1 mL stock solutions of 0.1 mg mL−1 of 3, 4, and 5 in CHCl3 were titrated with 0.1 mL MeOH aliquots and the optical absorption spectra recorded (Fig. 7). The titration was continued until a 1:1 mixture of CHCl3:MeOH was reached, or no further changes in UV-vis spectra were observed, whichever came last. The recorded UV-vis spectra were normalized by the inverse of the dilution factor for clarity (see Fig. S12, ESI†). For compound 3 no changes are apparent in the UV-vis trace (Fig. 7A) upon addition of MeOH up to 50% total concentration (1 mL) in CHCl3, indicating no changes in the supramolecular arrangements (if any) in solution. The apparent lack of aggregation of 3 in this range is likely a result of its high solubility in chloroform (>50 mg mL−1) afforded by the fully twisted structure. Compound 4 shows dramatic changes in its UV-vis spectrum as MeOH is added (Fig. 7B); specifically, the intensity of peaks at 505, 540, and 585 nm decrease and a new band appears at 610 nm. At 1.4 mL MeOH added, no further changes are seen in the UV-vis spectrum. There is a clear isosbestic point observed at 600 nm indicating a transition from one species to one other species. The spectra of 4 as the concentration of MeOH increases becomes increasing similar to the spectrum of 4 in thin film, indicating that the new species formed is likely an aggregated structure. The UV-visible spectrum of compound 5 shows small changes as the concentration of MeOH is increased (Fig. 7C), specifically, peaks at 520, 555, and 580 decrease in intensity. These changes are similar to the thin film profile, indicating that 5 also aggregates with the addition of MeOH.33
 Fig. 7  UV-Visible spectra of PDI based dimers (A) 3, (B) 4, and (C) 5 in dilute CHCl3 solution with varying concentrations of MeOH. 
To further characterize the solution dynamics, UV-vis spectra were taken at 20 °C and 60 °C of 3, 4, and 5 in both neat CHCl3 and a 1:1 CHCl3:MeOH mixture. At elevated temperatures there was no change between the spectra in CHCl3 or CHCl3:MeOH mixtures (see Fig. S13, ESI†). This helps confirm the formation of aggregates in solution for 4 and 5, as such species would be thermally instable.
Bulk heterojunction solar cells
Given that 4 and 5 maintain ideal energy levels compared to 3, but with different self-assembly and physical properties, we set out to compare their performance in bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells in order to attempt make a structure–property–function comparison. We fabricated BHJ solar cells using 3, 4, and 5 as the electron acceptors and PTB7 and PTB7-Th (see Fig. S17, ESI†) as the electron donors. All active layers were tested using a standard inverted architecture of ITO/ZnO/BHJ/MoOx/Ag. Full details on solar cell fabrication and testing can be found in the ESI.†
We have previously reported BHJ solar cells with PTB7:3 and PTB7-Th:3 active layer thin-film blends processed from C6H5Cl.48 Best PCEs reached 2.21% and 5.13% using PTB7 and PTB7-Th, respectively. However, in the present study we note the low solubility of 4 in chlorobenzene. Indeed, blended ink solutions of PTB7:4 gave poor quality thin films and poor photovoltaic performance with PCE below 0.5% (Fig. S14, ESI†). On the other hand, solar cells based on PTB7:5 films cast from C6H5Cl yielded smooth films and resulted in a best PCE of 1.37% for films cast without the use of solvent additives or post-deposition treatments. Use of the processing additives 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) or 1-chloronaphthalene had minimal effect on BHJ formation with PCE only slightly rising to 1.68%. Quite surprisingly, substituting the donor polymer PTB7 for the known higher performer PTB7-Th has little impact on PCE. Films of PTB7-Th:5 cast from chlorobenzene gave best PCE of 1.22%. Complete details on solar cells fabricate using active layers processed from chlorobenzene can be found in the ESI.†
To make a more direct comparison of three PDI materials to act as electron acceptors in BHJ solar cells we opted to switch the processing solvent from C6H5Cl to CHCl3, in which all materials demonstrate sufficient solubility, and also to increase the acceptor loadings, which is advantageous owing to the higher costs associated with the synthesis and purification of donor polymers compared to our N-annulated PDI acceptors. Data is presented in Fig. 8 and summarized in Table 4. Solar cells based upon PTB7-Th:3 active layer blends processed from CHCl3 exhibited high PCEs upwards of 5.23%. These PCEs are quite impressive considering no solvent additives were used, no post-deposition treatments were applied, and the solar cells were fabricated and tested under ambient conditions. Of particular note is the high open circuit voltages (Voc) achieved that are nearing 1 V which is among the highest for PDI based solar cells.6,39,69,70,76,77 The UV-visible absorption spectra of the PTB7-Th:3 blends are shown in Fig. S15 (ESI†). The absorption profiles of both materials complement each other with blends exhibiting broad absorption from 400–750 nm. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra for the PTB7-Th:3 blends follow the optical absorption spectra showing photocurrent generation above 15% from 400–750 nm (Fig. 8). Significant photocurrent generation is seen from approximately 450–600 nm, primarily where 3 absorbs, indicating that 3 contributes to photocurrent generation. For PTB7-Th:3 active layers, a 2:3 blend ratio was found to be only slightly better than a 3:7 ratio. As noted prior, being able to fabricate solar cells with a high acceptor loading is important considering the simple and low-cost synthesis and purification of 3. In direct comparison, PTB7-Th:4 and PTB7-Th:5 based solar cells gave best PCEs of 1.22% and 1.34% when processed under identical conditions. The Voc for all devices remained constant from 0.93 V to 0.97 V, while both the short-circuit currents (Jsc) and FFs decreased dramatically, thus pointing to an unfavorable BHJ morphology as the reason for the lower performance. Investigation of the EQE spectra of the PTB7-Th:4 and PTB7-Th:5 blends shows that both 4 and 5 contribute to photocurrent generation. Compound 4 exhibits a characteristic low energy band at approximately 620 nm in the thin-film optical absorption spectra. This peak manifests itself in the EQE spectra where there is a peak in photocurrent generation at 620 which increases when the loading of 4 is increased (i.e. from 2:3 to 3:7). Similarly, there is significant photocurrent generation from 400–600 nm for the PTB7-Th:5 based blends where 5 has strong light absorption. In all cases efficient electron transfer was observed as determined by the quenching of PTB7-Th emission using photoluminescence spectroscopy (Fig. S15, ESI†).

Active layer morphology
The BHJ active layer morphology of each OSC device was investigated using atomic force microscopy. Analysis of the images clearly reveals the cause of the drop off in performance for blends using compounds 4 and 5. For the PTB7-Th:3 blends, (Fig. 9A and B) a relatively uniform film with small, consistently sized domains is observed. For the PTB7-Th:4 (Fig. 9C and D) and PTB7-Th:5 (Fig. 9E and F) blends, the films are clearly less uniform and show the appearance of large, fibril like domains on the order of hundreds of nanometers. Such largely phase-separated BHJ blends are not ideal for achieving high performance and thus PCEs on the order of 1–2% are not surprising.

Conclusions
A series of three PDI based dimers were synthesized with 0, 1 or 2 acetylene units as spacers. The use of acetylene spacers between the PDI cores proved to be an effective method to control the steric hindrance between the PDI sub units. Dimers with no acetylene spacer were found to be highly twisted. The addition of one acetylene spacer reduced the steric strain between PDI subunits while the addition of two acetylene spacers rendered the PDI subunits coplanar. Overall adding acetylene spacers had the effect of reducing materials solubility in organic solvents, narrowing the optical bandgap through increased π-conjugation, and inducing strong aggregation behaviour in both solution and the solid state. Ultimately the latter resulted in an inability to form well-ordered BHJ blend films with the donor polymers PTB7 or PTB7-Th under standard processing conditions, and subsequently low photovoltaic performance was observed. On the other hand, the fully twisted PDI dimer 3 was able to form near ideal BHJ blends with PTB7-Th and high PCEs >5% were achieved. Thus while the addition of acetylene linkers could affect optical, electronic, and physical properties, it is not a great strategy to improve PCE owing to the lower performance observed and added synthetic steps. Of note, very recently Choi and co-workers reported a similar observation in that OSCs using PDI dimers with reduced ‘twist’ angles along the long axis of the molecule exhibited inferior performance to those with fully ‘twisted’ structures, which is consistent with our results.77 Moving forward within this series of N-annulated PDI dimers it will be important to focus on derivatives with a highly twisted backbone, although we do recognize that use of volatile solvent additives and new donor selection may improve OSC performance of the reported BHJ blends.
