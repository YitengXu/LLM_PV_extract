    , Accepted 3rd February 2020First published on 4th February 2020AbstractThe construction and synthesis of nanoarchitectures on a cost-effective substrate with eco-friendly properties has emerged as a novel strategy for synthesizing high-performance power and energy sources. In recent years, transition ternary metal oxides (TTMOs), especially combining similar-type TTMOs, have attracted extensive attention as favorable candidates for electrode materials. Among all the well-known TTMOs, MgCo2O4 is a stupendous one, owing to its excellent theoretical capacitance. Electrochemical calculations indicate that composites consisting of binary MgCo2O4 nanoflake arrays (MCO NFAs) and MgCo2O4/MgCo2O4 nanochain arrays (MCO/MCO NCAs) exhibit a hierarchical structure with a highly altered electronic nanostructure, providing better electrical conductivity, enhanced catalytic conditions, and enhanced supercapacitive performance. Under optimized conditions, the binary MCO NFA and composite MCO/MCO NCA structures offer more active sites and charge transfer during the faradaic reaction process. Most importantly, the binary MCO NFA and MCO/MCO NCA composite electrodes show high specific capacities of ∼316.8 and 265.3 mA h g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1. Interestingly, the MCO/MCO NCA composite electrode still maintained an outstanding rate capability with 97.9% of the capacity retained after 5000 cycles at a current density of 6 A g−1. Therefore, the MCO/MCO NCA composite material fabricated via the combination of similar types of TTMO grown on low-cost Ni foam is certainly promising for more research and application in SCs.
1. Introduction
In the past few years, clean and sustainable energy substitutes for fossil fuels have become very urgently needed, due to the increase in energy consumption and unbearable environmental pollution problems.1,2 Various types of green energy resources, such as Li-ion batteries, solar energies, fuel cells, wind energy and supercapacitors (SCs) or electrochemical capacitors (ECs), play a vital role in green energy approaches.3 Among them, one of the novel strategies of energy storage is supercapacitors, which have ultra-fast charge/discharge performance, remarkable power capabilities, excellent reliability, impressive round-trip efficiencies and ultra-long cycling capabilities.4–6 According to the mechanism of energy storage, SCs are usually categorized into two major types, i.e., pseudocapacitors (PCs) and electrical double layer capacitors (EDLCs).3,7,8 PCs usually involve reversible faradaic redox reactions at the surface of the electrodes, which can provide superior specific capacity/capacitance and energy densities, whereas EDLCs involve charge carriers at the interface of the electrode and electrolyte, which provides less power capability.2,9,10 In traditional PCs, metal oxides, including MnO2, CuO2, RuO2, NiO, etc., are well-recognized electrode materials with good energy densities, higher structural flexibility and richer oxidation states. However, traditional PCs face some problems in SC applications, such as higher cost, low life-span, high toxicity and lower specific capacity/capacitance values.3 Thus, to circumvent this situation, more effort is needed to develop high-capability electrode materials. Thus, there is a crucial need to develop fast-electron transportation at the surface of the electrode and electrolyte and enhance the specific capacity/capacitance, electrochemical activities, life-span and electrical conductivity.11,12
Recently, transition metal oxides (TMOs), particularly ternary transition metal oxides (TTMOs) such as ZnCo2O4, CuCo2O4, MnCo2O4, LiCo2O4, NiCo2O4 and MgCo2O4, have been considered as an excellent topic in the field of SC applications with fast redox reactions due to the contribution of two metal oxides, owing to their high theoretical capacitance and cost effectiveness.13 Among the TTMOs, MgCo2O4 is an important ternary oxide material and promising candidate for SC electrode materials, and has a theoretical specific capacitance of 3122 F g−1 because the mass transportation, ion diffusion, and electron transfer have all been promoted.14 This stable structure of MgCo2O4 will lead to a new research field in SC electrode materials. The main distinguished advantages of MgCo2O4 are low cost and toxicity, excellent electrochemical response capacity, environmental friendliness and natural abundance, which are required for SC applications.15 So, it is expected to achieve a higher capacitance and electrochemical response capacity. For example, Krishnan et al. prepared a MgCo2O4 electrode material by a molten salt approach achieving a spheroidal particle structure, and the CS tested at 0.5 A g−1 was 321 F g−1.15 Meanwhile, using a simple hydrothermal technique, Jose et al. successfully synthesized MgCo2O4 cuboidal microcrystals, which displayed a specific capacity (QSC) of ∼345 C g−1 at 1 A g−1.16 Additionally, Xu et al. presented porous MgCo2O4 synthesized using a hydrothermal route, and it exhibited a CS of 508 F g−1.17 Furthermore, a binder-free material organized by directly growing MgCo2O4 nanocone arrays on NF has been successfully synthesized by Cui et al., which exhibited a high CS of 750 F g−1.18 Very recently, Xu et al. prepared porous MgCo2O4 nanoneedle arrays using a two-step approach, and the MgCo2O4 material delivered a CS of 804 F g−1 at 1 A g−1.19 Furthermore, Gao et al. reported that a MgCo2O4 with ppy electrode material was directly developed on nickel foam, and the CS of this material reached around 1079.6 F g−1.20 Similarly, specific capacitances of 500 F g−1 at 50 A g−1 for MgCo2O4 nanowire arrays by Guan et al.,21 203.7 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 for hierarchical MgCo2O4 nanoneedle arrays by Kim et al.,22 and 516.7 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 for a MgCo2O4 nanostructure by Kim et al.,23 have been reported. Although great progress has been made, in comparison with its theoretical capacitance (about 3122 F g−1), the practical specific capacitance and rate capability under high charge–discharge current densities of MgCo2O4 are not satisfactory. Furthermore, binary MgCo2O4-based electrodes mostly show low electrical conductivity, low reversible capacity, and poorer cycling performance, which are the main drawbacks of binary MgCo2O4-based electroactive materials.24,25 Due to the drawbacks and the above limitations, binary MgCo2O4-based electroactive materials are still limited in terms of their wider commercialization; low specific capacity/capacitances and low energy and power densities are challenges that remain to be solved.26
Thus, the use of active materials in SCs should be improved to increase the specific capacity/capacitances, cycling performance and energy storage. In this way, much effort has been devoted towards the construction of multicomponent structures for novel electrode materials, which has effectively improved the electrical conductivity, reversible capacity/capacitances, rate capability and previously discussed drawbacks of binary metal oxides. For example, Guan et al. reported MgCo2O4@MnO2 nanoflake arrays by using a hydrothermal technique and gained a high CS of 887.3 F g−1 at 1 A g−1.27 Very recently, Kim et al. used a hydrothermal approach to fabricate MgCo2O4@SiCF nanostructures and achieved a high CS of 310.02 C g−1 at 5 mA cm−2.28 Moreover, Xu et al. presented hierarchical core/shell MgCo2O4@MnO2 nanowall arrays exhibiting a very high CS of 852.5 F g−1 at 1 A g−1.29 Overall, these literature reports proposed that a combination of two types of ternary metal oxide materials is crucial for improving the high electrochemical performances. To the best of our knowledge, the performance of binary MCO nanoflake arrays (NFAs) and composite MCO/MCO nanochain arrays (NCAs) is not satisfactory, and it is a big task to further improve the energy storage performance of SCs using binary MCO NFA and MCO/MCO NCA composite materials. Herein, we present the synthesis of MCO NFA and MCO/MCO NCA composite nanostructures using a simplistic hydrothermal technique. Owing to the high surface area and structural features, the design of the MCO/MCO NCA composite electrode achieved high specific capacities with excellent cycling performance when employed as an electrode material for SCs. Compared to the previously reported composite metal oxides, the excellent electrochemical results suggest that the MCO/MCO NCA composite could be a promising candidate for SC applications.
Inspired by the above ideas, for the first time, an aligned compact binary MCO NFA electrode and an MCO/MCO NCA composite on a Ni foam substrate were synthesized using a simple hydrothermal approach to produce highly efficient electrode materials. The use of nickel foam as a current collector enhances the connection between the active electrode material nanostructures and the collectors. Moreover, the nickel foam substrate also enhances the flexibility, electrical conductivity and transportation of electrons/ions. The nanochains (on the MCO/MCO) have been synthesized through a second mild hydrothermal process step. These nanostructures of the composite MCO/MCO NCAs exhibit rich reactivity compared with MgCo2O4 NFAs. The nanostructure of the hierarchical MCO/MCO NCA composite exhibited highly porous characteristics of the battery-type material with extraordinary electrochemical capabilities and highly boosted energy storage performance in SCs. The MCO NFA incorporation plays an essential role in designing the composite MCO/MCO NCA nanostructures, which was convincingly proven with different characterization analyses and from the result of electrochemical calculations. Thus, the construction of an active electrode composite with unique porous architectures is more suitable to be used for SCs. The composite MCO/MCO NCAs exhibit superior electrochemical properties of 316.8mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1, and long-term cycling stability with 97.9% capacity retention after 5000 cycles, mostly overcoming the great challenge of the low electrochemical properties of SCs.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Chemicals
All the reagents and chemicals (magnesium nitrate hexahydrate (Mg(NO3)2·6H2O), cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O), ammonium fluoride (NH4F) and urea (Co(NH2)2)) were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. Nickel foam (2 × 1 cm2) was carefully cleaned with a 6.0 M HCl solution in an ultrasound bath for 30 min to remove and eliminate the influence of the NiO layer from the surface, then rinsed with deionized water and absolute ethanol several times, and finally dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C.
2.2. Synthesis of the MCO NFAs on Ni foam
The hierarchical composite MCO/MCO NCAs were grown on Ni foam by a simple and cost-effective hydrothermal approach. In the first step of the synthesis procedure for the binary MCO NFAs, 0.5 mmol of Mg(NO3)2·6H2O, 1.0 mmol of Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 2.5 mmol of NH4F and 5 mmol of Co(NH2)2 were dissolved into 60 mL of deionized water at room temperature (RT) with magnetic stirring to form a clear solution and transferred into a 70 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (TLSSA). The TLSSA was sealed and maintained at 140 °C for 6 h and then naturally cooled down to room temperature, followed by annealing at 450 °C for 2 h. The precipitates were collected by filtration, washed with distilled water and absolute ethanol, successively, and then dried at 80 °C overnight. The first step of the hydrothermal reaction was completed and the binary MgCo2O4 NFA precursor/Ni-foam was obtained.
2.3. Synthesis of the composite of MCO/MCO NCAs grown on Ni foam
In the second step (two-step) of the synthesis process, 0.5 mmol of Mg(NO3)2·6H2O, 1.0 mmol of Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 2.5 mmol of NH4F and 5 mmol of Co(NH2)2 were dissolved in a mixed solution of 60 mL of deionized water with intense stirring at room temperature to form a homogeneous pink solution. The prepared-solution was then moved into a 70 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave, and a piece of MgCo2O4 NFA Ni foam with a size of 2 × 1 cm was placed into the solution. The autoclave was maintained at 140 °C for 5 h and cooled to RT naturally. The samples were then taken out and rinsed with deionized water and ethanol successively. Finally, the as-prepared samples were dried in an oven at 80 °C, followed by annealing at 450 °C for 3 h. The mass loading of active materials (MCO NFAs and MCO/MCO NCAs) on the Ni foam substrate was calculated to be 1.6, and 1.9 mg cm−2 (or 3.2 and 3.8 mg) by subtracting the mass of the bare Ni foam substrate from the mass of active material loaded on Ni foam (MCO NFAs/Ni foam substrate and MCO/MCO NCAs/Ni foam substrate) with an analytical balance (accuracy of 0.02 mg), respectively.
2.4. Structural and morphological characterizations
The as-fabricated materials were analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; S-4800; Hitachi, Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM; JEOL, JEM-2100F, South Korea), and high-angle annular dark field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS; H-7650; Hitachi Ltd, Japan, 200 kV at KIST, South Korea), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX; SUPRA 40 VP; Carl Zeiss, Germany). The as-fabricated electrodes were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 ADVANCE, Bruker using Cu Kα, at 40 kV and 40 mA). The BET surface area and pore size distribution of the as-synthesized materials were examined by a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 at ∼77 K. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements of the as-synthesized materials were taken with a Theta Probe (XPS, VG Scientific ESCALAB 250) in the Busan Center of KBSI.
2.5. Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical performance of the as-prepared electrodes was determined using a Biologic SP150 electrochemical workstation in a 3-electrode system. The working electrodes are the as-synthesized products. The counter electrode and reference electrode are platinum (Pt) and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE), respectively. Galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD), cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (Nyquist plot), and stability tests are all conducted in a 2.0 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. The specific capacity (QSC, mA h g−1) is estimated from the discharge duration of the GCD plots by using the following equation:30 (1)where I (A) is the discharge current, Δt (s) is the discharge time and m (g) is the mass of the active material. 3.6 is a constant to obtain the QSC units in mA h g−1.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Fabrication and structural investigation of the hierarchical binary MCO NFAs and MCO/MCO NCA composite

Fig. 1 displays a schematic illustration of the fabricated binary MCO NFAs and composite of MCO/MCO NCAs via two steps of hydrothermal process. In a typical procedure, Mg–Co precursors were first grown on a Ni foam substrate through the use of urea and ammonium fluoride with mixed metal precursors in a hydrothermal procedure at ∼140 °C. During the hydrothermal procedure, the urea was decomposed into ammonia and carbon dioxide, and then reacted with metal ions (Mg ions react with Co ions) to form a pink color, which is the binary MgCo2O4 precursor. In second-step process, the MgCo2O4 precursors undergo a composition conversion reaction through a hydrothermal approach at low reaction temperature to generate the corresponding MgCo2O4/MgCo2O4 NCA composite.

In order to accomplish a morphology that would provide excellent electrochemical properties, we successfully fabricated a composite combining similar types of TTMO, namely MCO/MCO NCAs. The surface morphology of the as-fabricated electrode nanostructures was examined by FE-SEM and the results are displayed in Fig. 2a–f. Fig. 2a–c depict the SEM images of the binary MCO NFAs. The SEM images of the MCO/MCO NCA composite (which have different second hydrothermal steps) are depicted in Fig. 2d–f. In Fig. 2a and b, the low magnification SEM images display the hierarchical nanostructures and morphologies of the binary MCO NFAs. The flake-like morphology in Fig. 2b indicates that the nickel foam substrate was completely covered by binary MCO NFAs. The high magnification SEM images (in Fig. 2c) depict the uniform thickness of the flakes of the binary MCO NFAs and the average thickness was estimated to be about 10–20nm. It was established that the binary MCO NFAs were vertically grown on the surface of the Ni foam skeleton and interconnected with each other. The new micro/nanostructure of the binary MCO NFAs could provide an excellent-rate reaction surface for electrodes and electrolytes.

The SEM images in Fig. 2d–f display the hierarchical composite MCO/MCO NCAs on Ni foam which were synthesized by the two-step (second) hydrothermal approach at 140 °C for 5h. In Fig. 2d and e, the SEM images at low magnification of the composite MCO/MCO NCAs show a chain-like nanostructure. There are many regular nanochains grown on the Ni foam substrate, which are depicted in the low-magnification SEM images. The thickness of the MCO/MCO NCAs on Ni foam was estimated to be about 30–50 nm (displayed in Fig. 2f). The thickness of the nanochain structures was increased, which is due to the long second hydrothermal process time. The MCO/MCO NCAs could provide a larger charge–discharge reaction surface area than the MgCo2O4 NFAs. The hierarchical nanostructure of the composite provided excellent electrochemical reaction performance due to the ionic transmission in the electrode and electrolytes. The nanochains of the composite MCO/MCO NCAs almost completely covered the MgCo2O4 nanoflake array structure. Furthermore, the high-resolution SEM image obviously indicates the unique porous network with a rough surface area, which may occur due to the combination of two types of TTMOs. The structure of the composite MCO/MCO NCAs is effectively retained after the introduction of binary the MCO NFAs, which was due to the superior compatibility of combining two types of Mg elements with O2− in their corresponding precursors. Also, the SEM observations indicate that MCO/MCO NCAs exhibit hierarchical architectures with an exclusive porous nature, as compared to the binary metal oxide of MCO NFAs. Thus, the best two-TTMO combination of the composite that we could accomplish was confirmed to attain a unique porous network with hierarchical morphology, which is beneficial to boosting the electrochemical performance and highly impressive stability of the MCO/MCO NCA composite material. In addition, the elemental distribution of the MCO/MCO NCA composite was further conducted by using SEM with the EDS color mapping approach, as displayed in Fig. 2g–j. The SEM-EDS elemental mapping obviously reveals the uniform distribution of the elements, such as Mg, Co and O in the composite MCO/MCO NCAs.
To obtain further insight, the morphology of the binary MCO NFAs and composite MCO/MCO NCAs was examined by TEM and HR-TEM analysis, the results of which are displayed in Fig. 3a–d. The low magnification TEM in Fig. 3a depicts the homogeneous distribution of porosity that was obviously proof of the binary MCO NFA architecture. Moreover, the HR-TEM images in Fig. 3b depict the lattice spacing of 0.286 nm, which is attributed to the (220) plane of MgCo2O4. As depicted in Fig. 3c, the low magnification TEM image of the composite MCO/MCO NCAs indicates a uniform distribution. It is clear that the composite was composed of various amounts of nanochains, which enhanced the surface area and electrolyte penetration. The hierarchical pore formation was due to the enormous strain instigated by the mismatch of the crystal plane. It is well-known that this kind of consideration is usual when the electrodes involve transfers from one phase to another phase, which is consistent with the previous reported literature. Such numerous hierarchical porous architectures can provide a large surface area for the electrolyte–electrode interface, and thus enhance the electrochemical properties and deliver better eco-friendliness in reactions involving the ultra-fast transportation of electrons and ions. Additionally, the HR-TEM in Fig. 3d shows the lattice spacing of 0.243 nm, which corresponds to the (311) plane of MgCo2O4. This result further proves the formation of a highly crystalline composite of MCO/MCO NCAs. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 3e, the EDS quantitative analysis of the as-prepared MCO/MCO NCAs shows that they are composed of Mg, Co and O elements without any impurities. Based on the EDX approach, the atomic percentages of Mg, Co and O are 19.73%, 21.34%, and 41.67%, respectively.

To decrease the interference by Ni foam, the as-prepared products were removed from the Ni foam by scratching. For the pure MCO NFAs and composite of MCO/MCO NCAs (Fig. 4), the diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern match well with the characteristic peaks for cubic MgCo2O4 (JCPDS card no. 02-1073).3 Sharp peaks are obtained for the (3 1 1) plane followed by the (4 0 0) and (5 1 1) planes. The XRD patterns of the MCO/MCO NCA composite and binary MCO NFAs show reflections at 2θ = 24.2 corresponding to the (002) plane of C, and diffraction peaks are also found at 2θ = 31.2, 36.8, 38.4, 44.6, 55.3, 59.2, and 65.0, respectively, corresponding to the (220), (311), (222), (400), (422), (511) and (440) planes, respectively. The minor variation in the XRD patterns might be due to the binary-type TTMOs of Mg, Co, and O elements and combining-type TTMOs of Mg, Co, and O element percentage. The diffraction peak width of the MCO/MCO NCAs is wider than that of the MCO NFAs.
 Fig. 4  XRD patterns of the binary MCO NFAs and the composite of MgCo2O4/MgCo2O4 NCAs scratched from Ni foam. 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to identify the valence states in the elemental composition and oxidation state of the MCO NFAs and composite MCO/MCO NCAs that are scratched from the Ni foam substrate. Fig. 5a displays the full-scan spectrum of the composite, which mainly has 4 core-level peaks that are allocated to C 1s (as reference), Mg 2p, Co 2p, and O 1s. Fig. 5b shows a zoomed-in clear binding-energy peak image for Mg 2p at 52.40 eV, the presence of which is consistent with what has been reported in a previous study.31Fig. 5c shows the zoomed-in or magnified Co 2p deconvolution. There are two pronounced peaks which correlate with Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2, and they divide into four peaks after it has been fitted. The fitted peaks with binding energies of 794.60 eV and 779.59 are related to Co2+, whereas the fitted peaks with binding energies of 796.10 eV and 781.01 are allocated to Co3+.32 With this progress, we proved the coexistence of Co2+ and Co3+ in the as-prepared electrode of the MCO/MCO NCA composite, which is consistent with reported literature. Furthermore, Fig. 5d depicts the zoomed-in deconvolution spectrum of O 1s, which delivered three oxygen environment contribution peaks located at eV values of 530.9 (O1), 531.7 (O2) and 533.1 (O3); these typically show a metal–oxygen bond and oxide defect states on the surface of the prepared sample, respectively.33,34 This excellent result further evidences the existence of the pure MCO/MCO NCA phase in the product. The XPS analysis obviously reveals that the highest energy shift is for the MCO/MCO NCA composite, which helped to enhance the electrochemical performance and impressive stability activities.

Ultra-conductive and abundant active sites are crucial requirements for the electrodes to avoid polymer binders and increase the utilization of the electroactive electrodes for industrial use. As a highly conductive support electrode, Ni foam is a suitable substrate to grow active electrodes such as hierarchical nanostructures because of its extraordinary corrosion resistance and light weight. The stepwise growth of hierarchical binary MCO NFAs and composite MCO/MCO NCAs on a Ni foam substrate could be used as a binder-free approach towards fulfilling their fabrication for SC applications. As illustrated in Fig. 6a–g, we investigated the electrochemical capabilities of the Ni foam-supported as-developed electrodes as battery-type samples (active electrode) for SCs in a standard 3-electrode set-up with Pt as a counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode in aqueous 2.0 M KOH electrolyte. Fig. 6a provides a representative comparison of the CV curves of both the binary MCO NFA and composite MCO/MCO NCA electrode materials at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in the potential window range from −0.2 to 0.5 V. It is well-known that for EDLCs, the CV curves depict very nearly rectangular characteristics, whereas ultra-faradaic reactions deliver a sharp and high current response. Both electrode features originate from the Faraday redox performance. Both as-prepared working electrodes show a pair of clear redox peaks, proposing typical battery-type GCD storage. The redox peak of the MCO/MCO NCA composite electrode, which is produced by the reversible Faraday oxidation–reduction process, is much bigger than that of the binary MCO NFAs. This suggested that the reaction mechanism process could be described with the following equations:35 MgCo2O4 + H2O + e− ↔ MgO + 2CoOOH(2) 2CoOOH + 2H2O + 2e− ↔ 2Co(OH)2 + 2OH−(3)As presented in Fig. 6b, the GCD plots of the binary MCO NFA and composite MCO/MCO NCA materials are produced with the same current density of 2 A g−1 in the potential window range from 0 and 0.4 V. The GCD plot, with an obvious plateau, reveals the battery-type GCD storage characteristics of both prepared electrodes. We found that the discharge time of the MCO/MCO NCA electrode (567.0 s) is about 1.25 times longer than that of the MCO NFA electrode (452.0 s), proposing that the composite MCO/MCO NCA electrode had better electrochemical capabilities, which is consistent with their CV results. Fig. 6c displays the CV curves of the composite electrode at various scanning rates from 5–80 mV s−1, and the voltage window range was −0.2 to 0.5 V. Moreover, the CV curves of the binary MCO NFA electrode at various scan rates are shown in Fig. S2a (ESI†). Nevertheless, both working electrodes displayed a symmetric anodic and cathodic peak, revealing the high reversibility of the hierarchical binary MCO NFAs and composite MCO/MCO NCAs. When we increase the scan rate from 5 to 80 mV s−1, the symmetrical shapes of the anodic and cathodic peaks for both working electrodes are excellently retained with negligible deviation in shape, indicating the superior electron conductivity with lower series resistance. This was due to the polarization in the electrode as the peak current rose. The GCD test of the composite MCO/MCO NCAs was carried out in the voltage range of 0–0.4 V (vs. SCE), and at various current densities from 2–15 A g−1, as illustrated in Fig. 6d. The GCD plots illustrate that each plot is non-linear with good agreement of the symmetric GCD features, proposing the good reversibility and charge–discharge characteristics of the electrode materials. For comparison purposes, the GCD plots of the binary MCO NFA electrode tested at different currents are also illustrated in Fig. S1b (ESI†). It was found from the GCD plot that the discharge and charge times decrease with the increase of the current density, and the specific capacitance decreases at a higher current density.

According to eqn (3), the specific capacity values of the binary MCO NFAs and composite MCO/MCO NCAs at various discharge current densities could be calculated, as illustrated in Fig. 6e. When the current density was 2, 4, 6, 10, 15 and 20 A g−1, the QSC values of the MgCo2O4/MgCo2O4 NCA composite were 316.8, 305.7, 292.5, 280.4, 271.2, and 263.2 mA h g−1, respectively. However, the specific capacities of the binary MCO NFAs were only 265.3, 253.9, 242.4, 231.5, 220.9, and 212.2 mA h g−1 at current densities of 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 mA cm−2. From the calculated results, when the current density increased from 2, to 4, 6, 10, 15 and 20 A g−1, remarkably the MCO/MCO NCA composite electrode material retained nearly 88.9% of the original capacitance, proposing that the hydrothermally fabricated composite had high-rate capabilities. This remarkable result was due to the ultra-large electrochemical surface area, and may lead to better electrochemical capabilities.
An EIS study is one of the versatile analysis approaches to further understand the excellent electrochemical capabilities of the binary MCO NFA and composite MCO/MCO NCA electrodes, and was carried out in the frequency range between 10−2 and 105 Hz (Fig. 6f). The calculated impedance results were fitted with the equivalent circuit, and the data include the charge-transfer resistance (Rct), solution resistance (Rs), constant phase element (CPE), and Warburg impedance (W). Fig. 6f illustrates the final data fitting values, which indicate that the impedance of the MCO/MCO NCA composite sample had a lower resistance (0.6 Ω) when compared to the binary MCO NFAs (1.4 Ω). Impressively, the MCO/MCO NCA electrode has the lowest resistance results due to the excellent electron transportation and ion diffusion, and good conductivity characteristics, which lead to an ultra-fast reaction happening in the electrochemical process. Thus, the above advantages indicate that the freestanding MCO/MCO NCA composite has less impedance and holds massive stability capability for ultra-scale applications in high-performance SCs.
Since the cycling stability of the transition ternary metal oxide-based materials in aqueous electrolyte could be vital for practical applications of SCs and batteries, repeated GCD tests were conducted for the binary MCO NFA and composite MCO/MCO NCA electrodes at a stable current density of 4 A g−1, and the data are displayed in Fig. 6g. Interestingly, 97.9% (dropped only by 2.3%) of the initial capacity was retained after 5000 cycles for the MCO/MCO NCA composite electroactive material. In addition, 94.5% (dropped only by 5.5%) of the initial capacity was still retained after the same 5000 cycles for the binary MCO NFA electrode, as depicted in Fig. 6g. This excellent result revealed and confirmed that the composite MCO/MCO NCA electrode demonstrated impressive stability performance and thus superior potential capabilities. The inset of Fig. 6g illustrates that the morphology of the hierarchical nanostructures is well maintained, and the working electrode is still anchored to the Ni foam substrate, intimating the super cycling stability of the electrode material. It is worth mentioning that the superior specific capacity and ultra-long-term stability of the MCO/MCO NCA composite material were very appreciable compared with some recently presented TTMOs of MgCo2O4-based materials, as shown in Table 1.

4. Conclusion
In summary, for the first time, hierarchical binary MCO NFAs and composite MCO/MCO NCAs on a Ni foam substrate were synthesized by using a simple and environmentally friendly hydrothermal approach, and their electrochemical performance as a binder-free electrode material for SCs was analyzed. The nanostructure of the hierarchical MCO/MCO NCA composite exhibited highly porous characteristics of the battery-type material with superior electrochemical capabilities providing highly boosted energy storage performance in SCs. Binary MCO NFA incorporation plays an essential role in designing the composite MCO/MCO NCA nanostructures, which was convincingly proven with different characterization analyses and from the result of electrochemical calculations. Thus, the designed working composite (MCO/MCO NCA) electrode with a unique porous architecture was perfect to be used for energy storage applications, namely in SCs. The composite MCO/MCO NCA electrode exhibits superior electrochemical properties (316.8mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1), and ultra-long cycling stability with 97.9% capacity retention after 5000 cycles, which mostly overcomes the greatly challenging task of improving the low electrochemical properties of SCs. Therefore, the present study demonstrates a general, facile, cost-effective, and eco-friendly procedure to construct combinations of similar types of TTMOs suitable for future-generation energy storage applications.
