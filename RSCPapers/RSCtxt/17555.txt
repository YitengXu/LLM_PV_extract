    , Accepted 11th January 2022First published on 11th January 2022AbstractAntimony selenosulfide, Sb2(S,Se)3, has emerged as a promising light-harvesting material due to its high absorption coefficient, suitable bandgap, and low-toxic and low-cost constituents. Previously, high-efficiency Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells were fabricated exclusively using Spiro-OMeTAD as the hole-transporting layer (HTL) with an n–i–p device architecture. However, the poor stability and high cost of the widely used Spiro-OMeTAD hole-transporting material may restrict its potential large-scale applications in solar cells. Here, we report stable and high-efficiency all-inorganic Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells enabled by an evaporated inorganic manganese sulfide (MnS) hole-transporting layer. MnS shows better valence band alignment with the Sb2(S,Se)3 absorber than Spiro-OMeTAD. With post-deposition heat treatment, MnS demonstrates increased carrier concentration and work function. These in turn result in the highest efficiency of 9.67% in all-inorganic Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells. Moreover, the unencapsulated all-inorganic Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cell demonstrates a remarkably enhanced stability compared to the Spiro-OMeTAD-based cells. These exciting results illustrate that MnS possesses a larger efficiency potential than Spiro-OMeTAD. This low-cost, efficient, stable, and up-scalable MnS hole-transporting layer may also be applicable to other emerging solar cells, paving a better pathway toward commercialization.
Introduction
Antimony selenosulfide Sb2(S,Se)3 has emerged as a promising photovoltaic material due to its RoHS-compliant and earth-abundant constituents as well as its excellent optoelectronic properties. Particularly, Sb2(S,Se)3 has a high light absorption coefficient (>105 cm−1) in the visible part of the solar spectrum, a tuneable bandgap from 1.1 eV (for pure Sb2Se3) to 1.7 eV (for pure Sb2S3), and excellent stability against moisture.1,2 In addition, its low melting point and high vapour pressure enable low temperature and up-scalable rapid thermal evaporation (RTE) and vapour-transport deposition (VTD) processing which is compatible with Si bottom cell manufacturing.3–5 All these features make Sb2(S,Se)3 a promising candidate in not only single-junction solar cells but also silicon-based tandem solar cells.6,7
Due to the highly anisotropic quasi 1D structure and the associated low effective carrier mobility of Sb2(S,Se)3, an n–i–p device structure with a fully depleted absorber and enhanced carrier collection via an extended built-in electric field is essential for achieving high efficiencies.8 The p-type hole-transporting layer (HTL) plays a key role in determining device performance by generating a built-in electric field at the rear interface and extracting photogenerated holes from the Sb2(S,Se)3 absorber to the counter electrode. Spiro-OMeTAD is the most widely used hole-transporting material (HTM) to date, inheriting from perovskite and dye-sensitized solar cells.9–12 The champion antimony selenosulfide solar cell also uses a Spiro-OMeTAD HTL, demonstrating a champion efficiency of 10% in 2020.2 However, the high cost (∼$600/g), high moisture sensitivity, and the lack of deposition techniques for mass production will restrict the widescale deployment of Spiro-OMeTAD.13 In addition, the chlorobenzene solvent and the additive acetonitrile for Spiro-OMeTAD are hazardous to the human's central nervous system, aqueous system and soil. Thus, alternative HTMs, such as PbS colloidal quantum dots, O2 plasma-treated NiOx, V2O5, and DTPThMe-ThTPA have been explored.13–16 Unfortunately, these HTMs are largely restricted by either toxic constituents, low power conversion efficiency (PCE), instability, or complicated synthesis processes. Therefore, a low-cost, non-toxic and stable inorganic HTM allowing for high performance and large-scalable processing is highly desirable for Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells.
In this work, we demonstrate a 9.67% efficient all-inorganic Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cell with excellent stability, enabled by using a manganese sulfide (MnS) HTL. Though MnS was used in perovskite solar cells,17,18 the differences in native properties of 1D Sb2(S,Se)3 and perovskite have already led to changes in designing such a heterojunction. The requirements of a HTL for perovskite and Sb2(S,Se)3 are completely different because of different carrier transport mechanisms. The highly anisotropic carrier transport in Sb2(S,Se)3 and extremely low effective carrier mobility determine that this material requires a strong built-in electric field to facilitate carrier extraction.8,19 Therefore, in our communication, a MnS HTL was deposited using up-scalable thermal evaporation followed by post-annealing treatment to specially meet these requirements. This all-inorganic Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cell shows superior stability and comparable efficiency compared to the Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cell employing a Spiro-OMeTAD HTL, highlighting the great potential of MnS as a non-toxic, low cost (∼$4/g) and stable HTL for efficient Sb2(S,Se)3 and other n–i–p or p–i–n architecture solar cells.17,20
Results and discussion
Our Sb2(S,Se)3 absorber films were fabricated using the same hydrothermal approach as described in our previous studies.2 This kind of Sb2(S,Se)3 absorber shows less favourable [hk1] orientations compared to those fabricated using rapid thermal evaporation (RTE) or vapour transport deposition (VTD), as measured using X-ray diffraction (Fig. S1, ESI†). The effective carrier mobility in our Sb2(S,Se)3 absorber may be even lower than the value reported in ref. 8. Therefore, a high-quality HTL is essential for efficient carrier collection of high-efficiency devices. In this work, our all-inorganic antimony selenosulfide solar cells employed a device architecture of glass/FTO/CdS/Sb2(S,Se)3/MnS/Au (Fig. 1a and b), by replacing the traditional Spiro-OMeTAD with 80 nm thermally evaporated MnS. We employed post-deposition annealing treatment to modify the quality of the amorphous MnS layer (Fig. S2, ESI†) and the Sb2(S,Se)3/MnS interface. Different annealing conditions including atmosphere, temperature, and durations were explored. From the perspective of photovoltaic performance, the best post-deposition annealing conditions are 175 °C for 10 min in a N2 atmosphere (see the details in Tables S1–S3 and Fig. S3, ESI†). Post deposition annealing under these conditions can significantly improve the coverage and uniformity of the MnS layer by removing O segregations, and voids at the Sb2(S,Se)3/MnS interface (EDS mapping and EDS line scan, Fig. S4 and S5, ESI†). Moreover, post annealing also increased the hole carrier concentration by one order of magnitude from (0.52–1.07) × 1017 cm−3 to (1.86–2.69) × 1018 cm−3 (Table S4, ESI†). This contributes to better conductance and a larger work function of the MnS HTL, which is greatly beneficial to the device performance as will be discussed in the following sections.

We compared the photovoltaic performance of the cells using as-deposited MnS, annealed MnS, and conventional Spiro-OMeTAD as the HTL respectively. The cells with the annealed MnS HTL show an average PCE of 8.39%, with an average VOC 634 mV, JSC 22.68 mA cm−2, and FF 58.4%, which is much higher than the cells with as-deposited MnS as the HTL (average PCE 6.27%, VOC 606 mV, JSC 12.17 mA cm−2, and FF 57.0%), and is comparable to those with Spiro-OMeTAD as the HTL (average PCE 8.72%, VOC 630 mV, JSC 22.54 mA cm−2, and FF 61.4%), as shown in Fig. 2a and S6 (ESI†). The PCE distribution histogram for 66 independently fabricated devices (only one device in one sample) in Fig. 2a displays a good reproducibility of Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells employing the annealed MnS HTL, where most of the devices deliver PCEs above 8.5%. The champion device with the annealed MnS HTL shows a peak efficiency of 9.67% (Table 1 and Fig. 2b), which is slightly lower but comparable to that with the Spiro-OMeTAD HTL (10.14% efficiency). This is the highest efficiency reported so far for all-inorganic antimony selenosulfide solar cells. In comparison, the best cell with the as-deposited MnS HTL delivers much lower VOC (604 mV), JSC (18.67 mA cm−2), FF (59.7%) and efficiency (6.73%), though showing a huge increase compared to an efficiency of 4.97% for an HTL-free device, i.e. FTO/CdS/Sb2(S,Se)3/Au (Fig. S7, ESI†). The diode characteristics (Rs, Rsh and A) manifest an obvious improvement of interface quality after post-annealing treatment, reflected by increased Rsh and decreased A (Table 1 and Fig. S8†).

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) response (Fig. 2c) of the 9.67% champion cell reaches over 90% in the 530–590 nm wavelength region with an integrated current density of 22.73 mA cm−2, which is in agreement with the value obtained from the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) measurement. Moreover, the cell with the annealed MnS HTL shows a similar EQE response to that of the Spiro-OMeTAD based cells, which is higher than that of the cell with the as-deposited MnS HTL in the whole spectrum. After annealing, the increase of EQE is particularly large in the short wavelength region (Fig. S9, ESI†). With the incident light coming from the n-type CdS side, the EQE in the short wavelength region is dominated by the collection of photogenerated holes near the CdS/Sb2(S,Se)3 interface.8 These holes are minority carriers in our n-type Sb2(S,Se)3 absorber layer,2 and need to travel through the entire absorber before being collected by the HTL. In a word, the large EQE increase in the short wavelength region suggests a greatly improved hole collection efficiency, which is closely related to the properties of the HTL materials and the absorber/HTL interfaces.
The all-inorganic antimony selenosulfide solar cells also demonstrated superior stability compared to the Spiro-OMeTAD based solar cells. We tracked the PCE of Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells with the MnS HTL and Li-TFSI doped Spiro-OMeTAD HTL as a function of storage time (Fig. 2d). All devices were stored at room temperature in ambient air at a relative humidity of 15–40% without encapsulation. The device with the MnS HTL retains over 95% of its initial PCE after 60 days of storage, while the device with the Spiro-OMeTAD HTL degrades to 58% of its initial PCE under the same conditions. The all-inorganic Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cell displays remarkably superior stability while possessing a competitive PCE, compared to the Spiro-OMeTAD-based Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cell. We attribute the superior stability to the absence of hydrophilic Spiro-OMeTAD and the moisture-sensitive Li-TFSI additive.22,23
We investigated the valence band maxima (VBM) and work functions of the as-deposited and annealed MnS HTLs to compare the band alignment at the absorber/HTL interface. We studied the VBM and work function using a method combining X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Hall measurements. These two techniques are less interfered by surface band-bending and surface contamination than ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS),24 thus, providing more reliable results. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements indicated that the as-deposited MnS and the annealed MnS have an identical VBM of −5.30 eV (Fig. 3a), slightly higher than the VBM of Sb2(S,Se)3 (−5.50 eV), while 0.19 eV lower than the homo energy level of Spiro-OMeTAD (−5.11 eV).25 Considering the carrier densities of MnS layers from Hall measurements, the MnS layers are not likely to degenerate. Therefore, the Fermi energy level, EF of the MnS HTLs can be calculated using the free carriers obtained from Hall measurements using the following equation: EF − EV = kBTln(NV/NA),(1)where EV is the valence band energy (VBE), kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature (∼300 K), NV is the effective density of states at the valence band, and NA is the hole carrier density. Here, the value of NV is 1.0 × 1021 cm−3 according to ref. 26. The calculated EF for as-deposited MnS and annealed MnS is −5.06 eV and −5.14 eV respectively, and the corresponding work functions are 5.06 eV and 5.14 eV respectively. The band alignment of the Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells with different HTLs is shown in Fig. 3b. The energy difference between the VBM of Sb2(S,Se)3 and the EF of HTL (ΔE) determines the energy loss during hole transport across the absorber/HTL interface. Assuming that the equivalent EF of Spiro-OMeTAD is the same as its HOMO energy level considering its typical high carrier concentration of ∼1019 cm−3,11 the ΔE of Spiro-OMeTAD-based cells is 0.39 eV. The cells with the as deposited MnS HTL show a comparable ΔE of 0.44 eV, whilst the cells with the annealed MnS HTL show a slightly smaller ΔE of 0.36 eV owing to the larger work function. This indicates that annealed MnS has a better band alignment with Sb2(S,Se)3 than the other two HTLs and can potentially deliver a higher VOC. To further investigate the reason for the band movement of MnS upon annealing, the Mn 2p and O 1s orbitals are characterised by XPS given that there are multiple valence states of Mn. The results reveal the existence of various valence states of Mn in as-deposited MnS (Fig. S11, ESI†), arising from the low vacuum level (2 × 10−3 Pa) during evaporation. The intensity of the peak representing Mn2O3 increases after annealing, demonstrating that a tiny degree of oxidation occurs due to the diluent process of oxygen gathering at the interface initially (Fig. S4, ESI†), supported by the enhanced Mn2O3 peak in the O 1s XPS spectrum after post-annealing (Fig. S11, ESI†). Thus, the introduction of a tiny amount of oxygen raises the valence band of MnS due to the narrow bandgap of MnOx.

(b) Band diagram of Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells including 3 kinds of alternative hole transporting materials: as-deposited MnS, post-annealed MnS and the Spiro-OMeTAD HTL (bandgaps of MnS were measured by UV-vis as shown in Fig. S10, ESI†). 
Although, annealed MnS has shown a better band alignment with Sb2(S,Se)3, the hole extraction efficiency and related JSC and FF also strongly depend on the intensity of the built-in electric field and the density of traps at the absorber/HTL interface. We investigated the depletion region width compared to the thickness of the Sb2(S,Se)3 absorber by performing capacity–voltage (C–V) measurements at 10 kHz. As shown in Fig. 4a, the static capacity of both cells with the as-deposited MnS HTL and annealed MnS HTL remains at around 8 nF at bias between −1.5 V and 0 V. This capacity is very close to the geometric capacity Cg defined by:27 Cg = εrε0A/t,(2)where εr and ε0 are the relative permittivity of absorber and vacuum permittivity respectively, A is the junction area (close to the device area), and t is the thickness of the absorber. This indicates that the Sb2(S,Se)3 absorbers are fully depleted in both cells, the same as that in typical Spiro-OMeTAD-based cells.2 When the bias is >0 V, the capacity of the cell with the annealed MnS HTL increases slightly before the collapse caused by significant carrier injection at forward bias. This capacity increase could be attributed to the slight depletion in the electron transporting layer (ETL) and the HTL. The cell with the as-deposited MnS HTL shows a larger capacity increase when the bias is >0 V, indicating a larger depletion in the ETL and HTL, which could be attributed to the lower carrier density in the as-deposited MnS HTL in this device. Although the absorbers are fully depleted, the built-in electric field near the absorber/HTL interface could be different, depending on the built-in potential, Vbi, which could be roughly estimated using the following equation assuming interface trap states are negligible:28 Vbi = kBT/qln(NaNH/ni2),(3)where q is the unit charge, Na and NH are the carrier densities of the absorber and HTL respectively, and ni is the intrinsic carrier density of the absorber. Therefore, one order of magnitude higher NH could lead to ∼60 mV ΔVbi. Assuming this ΔVbi is dispersed in 300 nm depth in the absorber, the average increase of the built-in electric field (ΔEbi) is 2 × 103 V cm−1, a considerable value that may significantly enhance hole extraction in the Sb2(S,Se)3 absorber. The fitted Vbi obtained from the Mott–Schottky (M–S) curve is 0.95 and 1.05 V for devices with the as-deposited and annealed MnS HTL respectively (Fig. S12, ESI†), the difference of which is consistent with that calculated from J–V measurement.

(b) Transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) of a base.i.e. glass/FTO/CdS/Sb2(S,Se)3 (ultrathin), capped with the as-deposited MnS HTL, post-annealed MnS HTL and Spiro-OMeTAD HTL respectively. 
We further compared the kinetics of carrier transport at the different absorber/HTL interfaces using transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS). Sb2(S,Se)3 layers used for TAS measurements are ultrathin (30–50 nm) to ensure that the excitation and emission signals could be detected clearly with a picosecond resolution. Fig. 4b shows the transient kinetic traces (decay of photo-induced absorption) of the devices using different HTLs, which are extracted from the TAS spectra (Fig. S13, ESI†). The decays of photo-induced absorption (PIA) are fitted using triexponential functions. The results are shown in Table 2. The shortest decay time τ1 could be dominated by the carrier extraction process driven by the built-in electric field, whilst the long decay time τ3 could be dominated by the trapping–detrapping and/or non-radiative recombination processes at the absorber/HTL interfaces, and τ2 is dominated by the combined processes.29 The devices with the HTL show a significantly smaller τ1 compared to the device without the HTL (9–23 ps for with a HTL vs. 140 ps for without a HTL), consolidating the critical role of the HTL in the carrier extraction process of these Sb2(S,Se)3 cells. Furthermore, the value of τ1 decreases and the corresponding coefficient A1 increases following the sequence of as-deposited MnS, annealed MnS, and Spiro-OMeTAD, in good accordance with the increase of carrier concentration in these HTLs. This consolidates that a high carrier density in the HTL and an associated strong built-in electric field are essential for efficient carrier extraction in Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells, which agrees with the observation of the great increase of JSC and FF after post-deposition annealing for MnS based cells, and the slightly higher JSC and FF of the Spiro-OMeTAD-based cells compared to the cells with the annealed MnS HTL. On the other hand, the device with annealed MnS shows a smaller τ3 than the Spiro-OMeTAD-based device, indicating more interface trap states in the device with the annealed MnS HTL, which may also be responsible for the lower JSC and FF compared to the Spiro-OMeTAD-based cells.

Conclusion
In summary, we have demonstrated stable and highly efficient all-inorganic antimony selenosulfide solar cells by employing a thermally evaporated and annealed MnS layer as the HTL. These all-inorganic antimony selenosulfide solar cells show superior stability than those using Spiro-OMeTAD as the HTL and a comparable PCE, with a peak efficiency of 9.67%. The annealing after MnS deposition significantly improved the carrier concentration, the associated work function, the uniformity and coverage of the MnS layer. With this modification, the MnS based solar cells show better valence band alignment and larger work function than Spiro-OMeTAD based cells, thus demonstrating a higher VOC. Although JSC and FF are still limited by the relatively low carrier density and high density of interface trap states, the great potential of MnS as a RoHS-compliant, stable, and cheap HTL material for high efficiency Sb2(S,Se)3 has been uncovered.
Experimental section
Deposition of MnS thin films
The MnS thin film was deposited on the FTO/CdS/Sb2(S,Se)3 substrate under a pressure of 2 × 10−3 Pa by thermal evaporation (Beijing VNANO VZZ-300 vacuum thermal evaporator). A rotatable sample holder was placed 30 cm above the tungsten boat in the chamber, ensuring a consistent thickness among specimens in the same batch. The tungsten boat loaded with 0.1 g MnS powder (99.9%, Alfa Aesar) was fixed on two metal terminals to form a DC path. When the pressure reached the target value, the evaporating temperature was tuned by increasing the current until the deposition rate reached 1.5 Å s−1. The final thickness was controlled at 80 nm and monitored by using a film thickness gauge. Finally, the samples were annealed at 175 °C for 10 minutes in a nitrogen-filled glove box.
Fabrication of devices
FTO-coated glasses (purchased from Liaoning Youxuan Tech. Co., Ltd) were pre-cleaned with deionized (DI) water, isopropanol, acetone, and ethanol (materials otherwise specified were all purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd) for 40 minutes sequentially. A UV ozone cleaner (HF-Kejing, PCE-22-LD) was employed to clean the FTO substrate before use. The cadmium sulfide layer was deposited on the FTO substrate by the chemical bath deposition (CBD) method.2 Then CdCl2 (20 mg in 1 mL methanol) was spin coated at 3000 rpm for 30 seconds and the sample was heated at 400 °C for 10 minutes in air to improve the grain size of the CdS layer and incorporate Cl and O into the film. This results in a better surface condition for epitaxial growth of Sb2(S,Se)3 in an autoclave reaction.30 After that, the Sb2(S,Se)3 layer was deposited by the hydrothermal method. Specifically, 20 mM antimony potassium tartrate, 80 mM sodium thiosulfate tetrahydrate and 23 mg selenourea (99.97%, Alfa Aesar) were added sequentially into a Teflon autoclave (50 mL nominal volume) with 40 mL DI water. The substrate inclined to the inner surface at 75°. Then the autoclave was sealed into a stainless steel tank and heated in an oven (Shanghai Jinghong, JHG-9023A) up to 130 °C for 130 minutes. After natural cooling to room temperature, the samples were then taken out, swilled with DI water and ethanol before being dried for 1 minute in a vacuum dryer (Shanghai Jinghong, DZF-6030) where the temperature was kept at 110 °C and the air pressure was 10 kPa. Afterwards, the samples were transferred to a nitrogen-filled glove box and annealed at 350 °C for 10 minutes for crystallization. Subsequently, the MnS HTL was grown by thermal evaporation as described above. Alternatively, the Spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by mixing 36.6 mg of spiro-OMeTAD, 14.5 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP), and 9.5 μL of a 520 mg mL−1 lithium trifluoromethanesulfonyl (Li-TFSI) together in acetonitrile in 1 mL of chlorobenzene. Finally, a gold back electrode was deposited on the MnS layer under a pressure of 5 × 10−4 Pa using a shadow mask resulting in contacts with a size of 0.12 cm2. Eventually, the thicknesses of CdS, Sb2(S,Se)3, MnS, and Au layers are 60, 320, 80 and 60 nm respectively in a typical device.

The morphology and element ratios of MnS thin films and devices were characterized by SEM (HITACHI UHR FE-SEM SU8200) with an EDS module (Oxford, AZtec X-Max 50), detecting elements from B(5) to U(92). XRD (Bruker Advance D8 diffractometer) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) was used to analyze the crystal structure. Raman spectroscopy (Horiba Jobin Yvon, LabRAM HR800) was applied to analyze chemical bonds of the films with 532 nm laser excitation. XPS (Thermo Scientific K-Alpha+) with a monochromatic Al Kα (1486.6 eV, 15 kV) source was used to characterize the surface composition and valence band. The bandgap was measured by UV-vis (SOLID 3700). The hole extraction capability was measured by using the transient absorption spectrum (Helios, Ultrafast System LLC), where a nondegenerate pump-probe configuration was applied to probe the transient dynamics (100 fs to 7 ns). Additionally, the pump and probe laser pulses were generated by frequency doubling the fundamental output (Coherent Vitesse, 80 MHz, Ti-sapphire laser) and white light generated with a sapphire plate, respectively. The decay characteristics were fitted using a triexponential model y = ΣAiexp(−x/ti). A hall test was conducted to identify the carrier concentration and film resistivity by using a Semilab PDL-1000 AC-Hall system.
Characterization of solar cells
The J–V characteristics were determined using a Keithley 2400 apparatus under AM 1.5 illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 provided by a standard xenon-lamp-based solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3 A, Japan). Before the test, the illumination intensity of the solar simulator was calibrated by using a monocrystalline silicon reference cell (Oriel P/N 91150 V, with a KG-5 visible colour filter), previously standardized by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The active area was limited to 0.04 cm2 or 0.09 cm2 by corresponding sized apertures and the test results show almost no difference under an active area of 0.04 cm2 or 0.09 cm2. The EQE (model SPIEQ200) was measured by using a single-source illumination system (halogen lamp) coupled with a monochromator. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEOL F200) was used to determine the device structure and elemental distribution. The TEM sample was vertically cut into a cross-sectional specimen with a thickness of around 100 nm by using a focused ion beam (FIB) coupled with a micro-sampling system (FEI xT Nova NanoLab 200), in which the surface of the specimen was treated with a gallium ion beam (16 keV, 50 pA). The C–V characterization was performed using a Zahner Mess System PP211 electrochemical workstation at a frequency of 10 kHz in the dark with the voltage ranging from −1.5 V to 1.5 V.
