    , Accepted 7th January 2018First published on 8th January 2018AbstractBaCO3 is primarily demonstrated as an excellent synergistic catalyst for efficient electro-reduction of H2O/CO2 to H2/CO at the state-of-the-art Ni–YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) cathodes for solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) with YSZ electrolytes and strontium doped lanthanum manganite oxygen electrodes. BaCO3 nanoparticles, which are deposited onto porous Ni–YSZ using the infiltration process, can significantly improve the SOEC performance such as increasing the electrode interfacial polarization conductivity over 50% and promoting the electrolysis current density by a factor of up to 2 for the electrolysis of H2O to H2, CO2 to CO, and co-electrolysis of H2O–CO2 to H2–CO at 800 °C. In addition, it seems that BaCO3 can improve the SOEC durability for the co-electrolysis of H2O–CO2. The improvement is associated with an enhanced surface charge transfer process, which is the rate-determining step for the reduction reaction, as shown by analyzing the AC impedance spectrum measured with a three-electrode configuration. The highest improvement is achieved with CO2 reduction possibly due to the additional enhancement in the adsorption/dissociation process by BaCO3 as revealed with temperature programmed CO2 desorption analysis.
Introduction
The reduction reaction of H2O/CO2 to H2/CO is the fundamental process to mitigate the problems associated with heavy dependence on finite fossil fuels. The reduction is a promising solution to transform greenhouse gas into syngas, which is an important feedstock for hydrocarbon synthesis through the Fischer–Tropsch (F–T) process.1,2 The reaction makes it possible to achieve a carbon neutral energy cycle using renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and geothermal heat. H2O/CO2 reduction is often conducted in electrolysers such as solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) because of their controllable reaction temperature, minimal energy consumption and nonconsumption of nonrenewable fossil fuels.3,4 High-temperature SOECs are more advantageous than low-temperature proton exchange membrane electrolysers and alkaline electrolysers because SOECs can produce H2/CO at a higher electrochemical reaction rate with a lower electrical energy requirement and have thus received much attention in recent years.5,6
The reduction reaction takes place at a SOEC cathode, which supports gas diffusion and provides active sites for the reaction. Porous Ni–YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) is the state-of-the-art cathode material for SOECs, in which Ni is the electrochemical catalyst to induce H2O and CO2 reduction and is responsible for electron transport while YSZ is the electrolyte which offers oxygen ion transport paths to extend the reaction sites, the three-phase boundaries (3PBs) where the pore, the electrocatalyst and the electrolyte meet.7,8 The length of the 3PBs, where the reduction reaction takes place, should be maximum to decrease the activation polarization resistance because of the inverse relationship between the 3PB length and the cathode interfacial polarization resistance.9 The 3PB length can be effectively increased by decreasing the sizes of Ni and YSZ particles, increasing the porosity for a given particle size, and modifying the Ni/YSZ ratio.10,11 To achieve a significant drop in the activation polarization and improvement in the electrical efficiency, in addition to maximizing the 3PB length, it is necessary to ensure that 3PBs are connected three dimensionally and only these 3PBs will be electrochemically active. Both experimental and modeling studies suggest that there is an optimum compositional Ni–YSZ electrode value to balance the 3PB density and porosity.12,13 So, the electrochemical reduction reaction properties of Ni/YSZ electrodes are strongly influenced by the composition and microstructure of the composites. Consequently, the electrode performance is greatly affected by the SOEC fabrication process, such as, dry pressing, tape casting and gel casting.12,14,15 In addition, microstructure optimization can promote the electrode performance by introducing an active fuel electrode layer to restrain Ni mobility.16
This work reports the promotion of the H2O/CO2 reduction reaction by depositing BaCO3 nanoparticles onto Ni–YSZ cathodes for SOECs. It is primarily found that BaCO3 has synergistic catalytic effects on H2O/CO2 reduction when it is infiltrated into the porous Ni–YSZ cathode although it is not an electronic or ionic conductor, nor an electrocatalyst. It is noted that BaCO3 has been demonstrated to be very effective in improving the oxygen reduction reaction on electrocatalysts such as La0.8Sr0.2MnO3−δ, La0.8Sr0.2FeO3−δ and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3−δ for solid oxide fuel cells, the reverse reaction of SOECs.17,18
Experimental
Sample fabrication
Single cells were fabricated using dry pressing with Ni–Zr0.85Y0.15O2−δ (YSZ) as the fuel electrode, YSZ as the electrolyte and La0.8Sr0.2MnO3−δ (LSM)–YSZ as the oxygen electrode.19 The YSZ, LSM and NiO powders were synthesized by the glycine–nitrate process and adapted calcination programs as described in detail elsewhere using zirconium nitrate pentahydrate (Zr(NO3)4·6H2O, ≥99.9%), yttrium nitrate hexahydrate (Y(NO3)3·6H2O, ≥99.9%), nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, ≥99.9%), lanthanum nitrate hexahydrate (La(NO3)3·6H2O, ≥99.9%), strontium nitrate (Sr(NO3)2, ≥99.9%) and manganese acetate tetrahydrate (C4H6MnO4·4H2O, ≥99.9%) as the precursors.17,20 The NiO/YSZ weight ratio in the fuel electrode was 60:40. The NiO–YSZ powder was mixed with 20 wt% polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) as the pore forming agent via ball milling in ethanol with zirconia balls for 24 h. The mixed powder was pressed at 30 MPa and the YSZ powder was subsequently added on the top of the pre-pressed pellet and co-pressed at 180 MPa to form a green bilayer structure. Then, the green bodies were sintered at 1400 °C for 5 h using a high temperature furnace (KSL-1700X, Hefei Kejing Materials Technology Co. Ltd), resulting in 10.5 mm diameter pellets with a dense YSZ thin layer supported on YSZ–NiO. The oxygen electrode powder with a LSM/YSZ weight ratio of 60:40 was mixed to prepare the electrode paste, which contained α-terpineol as solvent and ethylcellulose (Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co. Ltd, ≥99.9%) as the binder. Then, the paste was coated on the electrolyte with an active area of 0.24 cm2, dried and heated at 1200 °C for 2 h to form a porous oxygen electrode.
A YSZ electrolyte supported cell with a three-electrode configuration was also prepared to investigate the electrode performance. The YSZ substrates were prepared by uniaxially pressing the YSZ powder at 320 MPa followed by sintering at 1450 °C for 5 h. The substrate thickness was ∼300 μm, the size was 10.8 mm in diameter, and the relative density was ∼98% as determined with the Archimedes method. The NiO–YSZ electrode paste, which was prepared with the same process as for the LSM–YSZ paste, was coated on one side of the substrate to act as the working electrode (WE) with an active area of 0.24 cm2. After drying, the fresh bodies were heated at 1100 °C for 2 h. Then, the platinum paste (PE-Pt-7840, Sino-Platinum Metals Co. Ltd) was symmetrically coated on the opposite side of the WE as the counter electrode (CE). The reference electrode (RE) was also prepared with the platinum paste beside the WE, and the distance between the WE and RE was set three times larger than the electrolyte thickness, Fig. S1.†21 The WE and RE electrodes were heated at 600 °C for 1 h to remove the organics. The external Ag wires were attached to the electrode with Ag conducting glue (Shanghai Research Institute of Synthetic resins) as the binder.
BaCO3 particles were deposited onto the inner surface of the Ni–YSZ fuel electrodes using the infiltration process.22 The infiltration was conducted by dropping 0.3 mol L−1 Ba(Ac)2 (≥99.0%) solution onto NiO–YSZ, and heating at 800 °C in air for one hour. The BaCO3 loading in terms of MBaCO3/MNiO–YSZ × 100% was 8.9 wt% and 6.9 wt% for the two-electrode single cell and three-electrode model cell, respectively. The chemicals were from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd.
Characterization and electrochemical measurements
The microstructures were revealed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-6700F, JEOL) and transition electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2010). The phase structure was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku TTR-III) analysis using Cu-Kα radiation with 2θ from 20 to 80 degree at the speed of 3 degrees per minute. The electrode pore size distribution was determined using a mercury intrusion porosimeter (PoreMaster 60, Quantachrome, Boynton Beach, FL, USA). The single cell test installation is shown in Fig. S2.† The fuel cell model test was first carried out to characterize the electrochemical performance of the solid oxide fuel cell anode using 3% H2O–97% H2 (Nanjing Special Gas Factory Co. Ltd, ≥99.95%) as the fuel gas and ambient air as the oxidant. The electrolysis cell model was tested using 20% H2O–80% H2 for H2O electrolysis, 70% CO2–30% CO for CO2 electrolysis, and 20% H2O–10% H2–49% CO2–21% CO for H2O–CO2 co-electrolysis. The gases were from Nanjing Special Gas Factory Co. Ltd. The vapor pressure was controlled using a thermostatic waterbath. A Solartron Frequency Response Analyzer 1260 and a Solartron Electrochemical Interface 1287 were used for electrochemical measurements. AC impedance plots were measured and the frequency ranged from 106 to 10−1 Hz with an amplitude of 10 mV under open-circuit conditions for the single cell test and at a bias of −0.3 V for the three-electrode test. The contents of CO, CO2 and H2 were determined by online gas chromatography (FULI, GC9790II).
Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments were performed using a Thermo Electron Corporation TPDRO1100 flow apparatus. The CO2 signal was detected using a TCD detector. The powder of NiO–YSZ was first infiltrated with Ba(Ac)2 and heated at 800 °C in air to form BaCO3. Then the NiO–YSZ, BaCO3/NiO–YSZ and pure BaCO3 powders were heated in 10% H2 at 800 °C for 4 h with Ar as the carrier gas in order to reduce NiO to Ni. The samples were blown with CO2 at a flux of 20 cm3 min−1 and heated from room temperature to 200 °C and held for 30 minutes to remove water and other adsorbed gases. After cooling to room temperature, the samples were blown with helium at a flux of 20 cm3 min−1 and heated from room temperature to 1100 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1.
Results and discussion
Microstructure characteristics for the Ni–YSZ electrode with BaCO3

Fig. 1a shows the fractured microstructure of a single cell with Ni–YSZ as the fuel electrode, 39 μm-thick dense YSZ as the electrolyte and 50 μm-thick porous LSM–YSZ composite as the oxygen electrode. The Ni–YSZ electrode substrate is about 400 μm thick and 29.9% in porosity. The pore size ranges from 0.02 to 2.5 μm with small pores from 0.02 to 0.1 μm while the big ones from 0.2 to 2.5, Fig. 2. The big pore size is consistent with the SEM observation, Fig. 1b, where both pore size and particles up to 2.0 μm are observed in the bare Ni–YSZ electrode. After the infiltration and heating treatments, fine particles with an average size of ∼70 nm can be clearly seen on the inner surface of the Ni–YSZ electrode, especially along the grain boundaries, Fig. 1c. The nanoparticles are BaCO3 since heating Ba(Ac)2 at 800 °C forms BaCO3 as demonstrated in Fig. S3† and previous reports of XRD and thermogravimetric analysis.17,23Fig. 1d is a TEM image showing the interface of YSZ–BaCO3. The average d-spacing of 0.309 nm is identified as the (201) planes of orthorhombic BaCO3 and the average d-spacing of 0.258 nm is identified as the (200) plane of cubic YSZ. No solid reaction is suggested between YSZ and BaCO3 from microstructure and phase analysis as shown in Fig. S3.† BaCO3–YSZ is stable at 800 °C in the fuel electrode atmospheres when it is exposed to 20% H2O–80% H2, 70% CO2–30% CO, and 20% H2O–10% H2–49% CO2–21% CO environments for 20 h, Fig. S4.† After BaCO3 infiltration, the porosity is slightly decreased from 29.9 to 28.9%. The pore size and distribution are also slightly reduced as can be seen from Fig. 2.

BaCO3 effect on single cell performance in the fuel cell model

Fig. 3a shows the current–voltage (I–V) and current–power (I–P) curves for a single cell with the bare Ni–YSZ electrode when humidified hydrogen is used as the fuel and air as the oxidant. The peak power density at 800 °C is 0.47 W cm−2, which is comparable with those reported for YSZ based cells with similar structures.24,25 When 8.9 wt% BaCO3 is infiltrated into the Ni–YSZ electrode, the peak power density is reduced from 0.47 to 0.37 W cm−2, Fig. 3b. The reduced power density should be attributed to BaCO3 infiltration since the two cells are constructed with the same LSM–YSZ cathode and YSZ electrolyte. Besides, the interfacial polarization resistance under open circuit conditions increases after BaCO3 infiltration, as shown in Fig. S5† where the impedance spectra were measured after the single cell was operated in the fuel cell model at a constant current density of 0.5 A cm−2 for 90 min. And the fitting polarization resistance values are listed in Table S1.† The interfacial polarization resistance increases from 0.53 to 0.71 Ω cm2 under open circuit conditions at 800 °C after infiltrating BaCO3. This demonstrates that BaCO3 is not catalytically active but has negative effects on the H2 oxidation reaction at the Ni–YSZ electrode. BaCO3 deposited along the boundary as shown in Fig. 1c would reduce the active reaction sites, the Ni-YSZ-gas three-phase boundaries, for the electrochemical oxidation.

BaCO3 effect on single cell performance in the electrolysis cell model

Fig. 4 shows the electrolysis performance at 800 °C, which was obtained after the single cell was operated in the electrolysis cell model at a constant current density of −0.5 A cm−2 for 90 min. Under experimental conditions, the current density increases almost linearly with the increase of applied voltage, Fig. 4a, suggesting not any concentration polarization phenomenon. When Ni–YSZ is used as the fuel electrode, the current density at 1.3 V is 0.45 A cm−2 for H2O electrolysis. The current density is comparable to those obtained with the same Ni–YSZ/YSZ/YSZ–LSM cell configuration that is prepared also with the dry pressing method, Table 1.26 The current density is 0.27 A cm−2 and 0.36 A cm−2 at 1.3 V for CO2 electrolysis and H2O–CO2 co-electrolysis, respectively. The average cell resistance as estimated from the I–V curve is 0.99, 1.53 and 1.12 Ω cm2 for H2O, CO2 and H2O–CO2 electrolysis, respectively. The H2O electrolysis performance is higher than that of CO2 electrolysis, while, the co-electrolysis behaviour is between those of H2O and CO2 electrolysis, in accordance with reports that H2O is easier to be electrochemically reduced in the porous Ni–YSZ electrode.27,28 When 8.9 wt% BaCO3 is deposited onto Ni–YSZ, the electrolysis efficiency is significantly enhanced, Fig. 4a. At 1.3 V, the current density is increased by 53%, from 0.45 to 0.69 A cm−2 for H2O electrolysis. A promotion of 104% is achieved for CO2 electrolysis, from 0.27 to 0.55 A cm−2, and from 0.36 to 0.62 A cm−2 for H2O–CO2 co-electrolysis, corresponding to a 72% increase. The average cell resistance estimated from the I–V curve is also reduced, from 0.99 to 0.59 Ω cm2 for H2O, 1.53 to 0.75 Ω cm2 for CO2, and 1.12 to 0.62 Ω cm2 for H2O–CO2. Fig. 4b compares the impedance spectra and shows the corresponding fitting equivalent circuit. The resistance corresponding to the electrolyte and lead wires is deducted to clearly compare the electrode performance. It is obvious that the interfacial polarization resistance Rp is decreased by introducing BaCO3 particles into the Ni–YSZ electrode, from 1.01, 1.59 and 1.18 Ω cm2 for the electrolysis of H2O, CO2 and CO2–H2O, respectively, to 0.64, 0.82 and 0.70 Ω cm2. That is, adding BaCO3 increases the electrode interfacial conductivity 1/Rp under open circuit conditions by 58% for H2O electrolysis, 94% for CO2, and 69% for H2O–CO2 co-electrolysis. So, both the I–V tests and impedance measurements have shown that BaCO3 improves the activity for the reduction reaction of H2O/CO2 to H2/CO. The improvement suggests that BaCO3 is an excellent synergistic catalyst for the electrochemical H2O/CO2 reduction at the state-of-the-art Ni–YSZ cathodes for SOECs considering that the current densities and the electrode interfacial conductivities are improved by at least 50%. Among the three electrolysis reactions, the highest improvement is achieved for CO2 electrolysis while the lowest is for H2O, demonstrating that BaCO3 exhibits better synergistic catalytic activity toward CO2 electrolysis.

It is noted that Rp at 800 °C under open circuit conditions changes after a series of cell tests in the electrolysis model as shown in Fig. 4. Rp is initially 0.71 and decreases to 0.64 Ω cm2 for the BaCO3/Ni–YSZ based single cell. The reduction could be caused by the activation effect of the LSM–YSZ air electrode, which increases the electrode performance.29,30 In contrast, for the cell without BaCO3, Rp increases from 0.54 to 1.01 Ω cm2. Since the operating conditions and the air electrodes are the same for the two cells, the difference must be attributed to the fuel electrodes. It is reported that carbon fibers form at the interface of the Ni–YSZ electrode and YSZ electrolyte for CO2 electrolysis in the CO–CO2 mixture and for H2O–CO2 co-electrolysis in the H2–H2O–CO2 mixture.31,32 And carbon deposition usually causes performance degradation. So, the observed increase in Rp for the bare Ni–YSZ based cell is consistent with previously reported results, for example, Tao et al. reported that the series resistance showed a significant increase from 0.09 to 0.16 Ω cm2 at 875 °C after the 10 hour co-electrolysis test in a 45% H2O–45% CO2–10% H2 atmosphere at a current density of 2.25 A cm2.31 Compared with the bare Ni–YSZ electrode, BaCO3 deposition reduces Rp, suggesting that BaCO3 can improve the electrode stability, possibly by preventing the formation of carbon fibers.
The single cell performance for CO2 electrolysis using 70% CO2–30% CO as the fuel with a series of BaCO3 contents is also measured as shown in Fig. S6.† The electrolysis performance first increases with the BaCO3 content increase from 0 (without BaCO3) to 8.9 wt%, and then decreases with the BaCO3 content increase from 8.9 to 12.1 wt% as shown in Fig. S6a and b.† The current density at 1.3 V is 0.27, 0.41, 0.51 and 0.55 A cm−2 for CO2 electrolysis when BaCO3 contents are 0, 3.7, 5.6 and 8.9 wt%, respectively. The current density increases with the BaCO3 content. While, when the BaCO3 content keeps increasing to 10.4 and 12.1 wt%, the current density at 1.3 V decreases to 0.43 and 0.32 A cm−2. The interfacial polarization resistance under open-circuit conditions is 1.59, 1.06, 0.86, 0.82, 0.93 and 1.30 Ω cm2 when the BaCO3 content is respectively 0, 3.7, 5.6, 8.9, 10.4 and 12.1 wt%. The CO2 electrolysis cell shows the best performance when the BaCO3 content is 8.9 wt% in the present work.
The potentiostatic measurement results in Fig. 4c exhibit relatively stable current density at various applied voltages for H2O–CO2 co-electrolysis. The potentiostatic measurement is conducted after I–V and impedance tests. The current density is 1.06 A cm−2 at 1.6 V for the BaCO3/Ni–YSZ cell, much higher than 0.66 A cm−2 for the Ni–YSZ cell. After the measurements shown in Fig. 4a–c, the durability test is conducted for H2O–CO2 co-electrolysis, Fig. 4d. The initial current density is 0.59 A cm−2, and reduces to 0.51 A cm−2 in 280 h. The cell degraded by 14% after 280 h operation. It is noted that the durability is improved by BaCO3 when compared with the literature results. For example, Kim-Lohsoontorn reported 20% degradation after 200 h operation at only 0.1 A cm−2 with an initial voltage of 1.3 V using a Ni–YSZ/YSZ/LSM–YSZ cell prepared also with the dry pressing process.33 Much worse durability has been reported by Kim-Lohsoontorn for H2O–CO2 co-electrolysis at the Ni–YSZ cathode, 13% degradation after only 20 h operation at 0.5 A cm−2 with an initial voltage of 1.58 V.26 So, it is very likely that BaCO3 has a positive effect on the durability.
Reverse water gas shift (RWGS), H2 + CO2 = CO + H2O, plays an important role in the CO2 reduction reaction when H2 and CO2 co-exist in the Ni–YSZ electrode chamber.35Fig. 5 shows the out gas component and the CO2 conversion ratio under open circuit conditions for the RWGS reaction. The details are listed in Table S2.† An obvious content of CO in the outlet gas demonstrates the excellent catalytic activity of Ni for the RWGS reaction. The outlet CO contents for the BaCO3/Ni–YSZ electrode are lower than those for the Ni–YSZ electrode. Fig. 5b compares the CO2 conversion ratios, which are lower than the equilibrium conversion ratio of 75.2% estimated with thermodynamic data. The conversion ratio for the BaCO3 infiltrated electrode is about 4% lower than that without BaCO3, revealing that the RWGS reaction is restrained by BaCO3 particles. The outlet gas component under SOEC operation is shown in Fig. S7.† Both Ni–YSZ and BaCO3/Ni–YSZ cells are operated with a current density of −0.5 A cm−2, and the CO2 conversion ratio is increased by ∼12% for the two cells compared with that operated under open circuit conditions. The same improvement in conversion ratio is simply caused by the equal electrolysis current density, suggesting that the negative effect of BaCO3 for the RWGS reaction still exists in the SOEC + RWGS model. Thus, the increased current density and reduced resistance shown in Fig. 4a and b are not caused by the enhancement in RWGS but in the electrochemical reaction associated with BaCO3.

BaCO3 effects on the electrolysis process at the Ni–YSZ cathode
To reveal the BaCO3 effect on the cathode reaction process, impedance spectra are investigated at 800 °C for the electrolysis of H2O, CO2 and H2O–CO2 using a three-electrode installation, Fig. 6, where the resistance corresponding to the electrolyte and lead wires is deducted. The interfacial polarization resistance is 4.00, 7.52 and 6.30 Ω cm2 for the electrolysis of H2O, CO2 and H2O–CO2, respectively, when Ni–YSZ is used as the working electrode. The resistance is larger than the corresponding value obtained from the single cell under open circuit conditions. The large resistance has also been observed by Szymczewska from the three electrode configuration.36 The three-electrode measurement demonstrates that Ni–YSZ exhibits better performance for the electrolysis of H2O than CO2, which is consistent with that from the single cell test and literature reports.28 When the Ni–YSZ electrode is infiltrated with 6.9 wt% BaCO3, the interfacial polarization resistance is reduced, from 4.00 to 2.88 Ω cm2 for H2O electrolysis, from 7.52 to 5.49 Ω cm2 for CO2 electrolysis and from 6.30 to 3.63 Ω cm2 for H2O–CO2 co-electrolysis. So, the three-electrode cell investigation also demonstrates that BaCO3 particles enhance the catalytic activity of the Ni–YSZ cathode for the electrolysis of H2O, CO2 and H2O–CO2. The interfacial polarization resistance for CO2 electrolysis in a 70% CO2–30% CO atmosphere using a three-electrode installation with different BaCO3 contents is shown in Fig. S8,† and is 7.52, 6.11, 5.49, 5.79, 6.40 and 7.12 Ω cm2 when BaCO3 contents are 0 (without BaCO3), 4.3, 6.9, 8.1, 9.8 and 11.2 wt%. In the three-electrode mode, 6.9 wt% BaCO3 loading shows the best catalytic activity of the Ni–YSZ cathode for CO2 electrolysis.

In order to understand the BaCO3 effect on the electrolysis process, the impedance spectrum is transferred into the corresponding distribution of relaxation time (DRT) spectra, Fig. 7.37,38 Each plot contains three peaks, P1, P2 and P3, each one representing different electrode reaction processes.39–41 The low-frequency P1 registered near 10 Hz is related to the reactions on the gas/electrode surface such as adsorption and dissociation. The middle-frequency P2 near 103 Hz is associated with the surface charge transfer reaction. And the high-frequency P3 near 104 Hz represents the oxygen ion transport reaction. The area for each peak is the resistance associated with the corresponding reaction. Obviously, the process for P2 dominates the whole reaction since the area of P2 is much higher than the sum of P1 and P3, and contributes at least 69% of the total electrode resistance. The area of P3 does not change much with BaCO3 addition, suggesting that BaCO3 has almost no effects on the oxygen ion transportation process for the electrochemical reduction. The area for P2 is significantly reduced by infiltrating BaCO3 particles, from 3.71 to 2.63 Ω cm2 for H2O electrolysis, from 5.41 to 3.52 Ω cm2 for CO2 electrolysis and from 5.39 to 2.86 Ω cm2 for H2O–CO2 co-electrolysis. Thus, BaCO3 particles can obviously accelerate the surface charge transfer reaction process, which is also the rate-limiting step for the electrolysis reaction, thus significantly reducing the total electrode polarization resistance. The area for P1 for H2O electrolysis is almost not changed by BaCO3, inferring that steam adsorption/dissociation is not affected by BaCO3. But, BaCO3 has an obvious effect on CO2 adsorption/dissociation, reducing the P1 resistance from 1.81 to 1.34 Ω cm2. In addition, BaCO3 reduces the resistance, from 0.61 to 0.53 Ω cm2, for the adsorption/dissociation process of H2O–CO2 co-electrolysis.

The elementary steps for H2/H2O and CO/CO2 conversion at the Ni–YSZ electrode are listed in Table 2.42–44 Their corresponding forms for the reaction rate r (mol s−1 cm−2) for H2/H2O conversion are shown with eqn (1-H1)–(1-H6) according to the principle suggested by Wang et al. for an elementary chemical reaction and a charge transfer step.45 r1 = k1pH2O − k−1[H2O(s)](1-H1) (1-H2) (1-H3) (1-H4) r5 = k5[H(s)]2 − k−5[H2(s)](1-H5) r6 = k6[H2(s)] − k−6pH2(1-H6)Here, ki and k−i represent the rate constants of the forward and reverse reaction, respectively.

If step H-2 is the rate-determining step, other steps are treated as being virtually in equilibrium. Consequently, the global rate can be expressed as (2)
When the reaction is in balance, the reaction rate is zero. Therefore, the equilibrium electric potential, Eeq., can be derived from eqn (2), (3)
When the electrode polarization exists and the polarization potential is η, the electric potential of the reaction is E = Eeq − η(4)
Substituting eqn (3) and (4) into eqn (2) yields the actual reaction rate. According to the faradaic current i = nFr and the polarization resistance Rp = η/i, we can get the relationship between Rp and partial pressure, Rp ∝ pH2O−3/4pH2−1/4(5)

Table 2 also lists all the relationships between polarization resistance and partial pressure when each elementary reaction is the rate-determining step for H2/H2O conversion. Similarly, the relationship for CO/CO2 conversion is derived and listed in Table 2.

Fig. 8a shows the impedance spectra measured at 800 °C for the BaCO3/Ni–YSZ electrode using a three-electrode installation in a series of H2O contents. The polarization resistance decreases with the increase of H2O contents. Fig. 8c shows that Rp linearly changed with pH2O−3/4pH2−1/4 with a linearly-dependent-coefficient of 0.996, suggesting that the step H-2 is the rate-determining step, consistent with the literature results that the conversion between OH− and H2O species in the Ni–YSZ electrode is the rate-determining step.47,48 This result also corresponds to the DRT analysis for H2O electrolysis (Fig. 7a), which indicates that the middle-frequency process P2, which is associated with the surface charge transfer reaction, dominates the whole reaction. The other Rp–pressure relationships for H2/H2O conversion are shown in Fig. S9.† These curves deviate much from the linear relation, suggesting that only step H-2 is the rate-determining one. Similarly, the impedance spectra and the Rp dependence on the partial pressure in a CO–CO2 atmosphere are shown in Fig. 8b and d, respectively. Rp shows a linear dependence on pCO2−3/4pCO−1/4 with a linearly-dependent-coefficient of 0.999, suggesting that the step C-2 is the rate-determining step, corresponding to the literature results that the charge-transfer step involving CO2 and CO conversion is the overall rate-determining process.43 The result also agrees well with the DRT analysis for CO2 electrolysis (Fig. 7b), which indicates that the P2 process dominates the whole reaction. The other Rp–pressure relationships in a CO–CO2 atmosphere can be found in Fig. S10.† But a good linear relation is not observed, further revealing that only C-2 is the rate-determining step for CO2 electrolysis under the present conditions.

Fig. 9 shows the TPD curves for Ni–YSZ, BaCO3/Ni–YSZ (8.9 wt% BaCO3) and BaCO3 powders. Ni–YSZ shows three desorption peaks at 285, 400 and 886 °C. The peaks at 285 and 400 °C are related to the physical desorption of CO2, while the peak at 886 °C is related to the desorption of CO2 molecules adsorbed on oxygen vacancies.49 For the BaCO3 desorption curve, an obvious peak at 438 °C represents the physical desorption of CO2. There are peaks at 930 °C and higher temperature, which represent the BaCO3 decomposition to BaO and CO2, consistent with the literature result that BaCO3 will lose CO2 to form BaO at about 960 °C in an inert gas of Ar.50 Compared with Ni–YSZ and BaCO3, an additional peak at 600 °C is revealed for the curve of Ni–YSZ infiltrated with 8.9 wt% BaCO3. The peak is probably caused by the interaction between BaCO3 and Ni–YSZ, promoting the ability of CO2 adsorption. The amount of CO2 desorbed at temperatures below 700 °C is 14.02 and 11.29 μmol g−1 for BaCO3 and Ni–YSZ samples, respectively. For the BaCO3/Ni–YSZ system, the amount is 39.21 μmol g−1, 2–3 times higher than that of BaCO3 and Ni–YSZ. Obviously, BaCO3 can promote the CO2 adsorption process, which has also been demonstrated with the DRT analysis. The promoted adsorption process possibly results in the highest improvement in the CO2 reduction reaction by BaCO3.

Conclusion
BaCO3 was demonstrated to be an excellent synergistic catalyst for the H2O/CO2 reduction reaction at the state-of-the-art Ni–YSZ fuel electrode for SOECs. Improved H2O/CO2 electro-reduction activity was obtained for single cells with YSZ electrolytes and LSM–YSZ oxygen electrodes when 8.9 wt% BaCO3 was deposited onto Ni–YSZ fuel electrodes although BaCO3 had a negative effect on the H2 electro-oxidation reaction and the RWGS reaction. The current density at 1.3 V and 800 °C was increased by 53%, 103% and 72%, meanwhile, the total electrode interfacial polarization conductivity 1/Rp under open-circuit conditions was increased by 58%, 94% and 69% for the electrolysis of H2O, CO2 and H2O–CO2, respectively. Compared with the report by Kim-Lohsoontorn, it is very likely that BaCO3 can improve the durability of the Ni–YSZ cathode. DRT analysis of the electrochemical impedance spectra measured with a three-electrode configuration revealed that BaCO3 particles could significantly reduce the interfacial polarization resistance for the surface charge transfer reaction, which was the rate limiting step for the H2O/CO2 reduction. The CO2-TPD results revealed that BaCO3 enhanced the CO2 adsorption/dissociation process, which also enhanced the CO2 reduction reactions.
