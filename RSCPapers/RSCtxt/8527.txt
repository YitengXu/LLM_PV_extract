1. Introduction
With the rapid growth of the IoT1 and AI,2 portable devices and wireless sensors have been further developed to promote a smart and information-based age. A major challenge relating to wearable electronics is the frequent charging or replacement of batteries, limiting developments aimed towards miniaturization and portability.3 Energy-harvesting technology that could obtain energy from the ambient environment and convert it into electrical energy to supply electronic devices has made great progress in recent years.4 Integrating energy-harvesting technology, such as solar cells or electromagnet generators, with electronic devices can provide a method to overcome the above-mentioned problems. However, the use of solar energy is unsustainable due to the influence of weather and external light factors, while electromagnetic generators will suffer from issues of convenience because of their complexity and large weight. Nanogenerators (NGs) overcome the shortcomings of other types of energy-harvesting technology, and they have received extensive attention in the energy-supply field with the approach of recycling mechanical energy. Because of differences in the way that energy is harvested, NGs can mainly be classified as triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs),5 or thermoelectric nanogenerators (TEGs).6 Compared with other NGs, TENGs, first reported by Wang et al. in 2012,7 exhibit obvious advantages in terms of their output power, stability, and integration, suggesting a promising future for self-powered applications, including human motion detection,8–10 healthcare,11–13 safety monitoring,14–16 human–machine interfaces,17 and vehicle monitoring systems.18–21
Based on a combination of the contact-electrification effect and electrostatic induction,22,23 TENGs with different sizes and structures can convert ubiquitous and diverse sources of mechanical energy from the surrounding environment, including small-scale energy (sound waves, bioenergy, airflow, raindrops, etc.)24–30 and large-scale energy (wind, water, and ocean energy, etc.).31–40 For example, Liu et al. presented an implantable TENG on the millimeter-scale to monitor endocardial pressure.41 This miniature TENG with a multilayered structure (encapsulation layers, electrode layers, triboelectric layers, and spacer layers) has significant sensitivity and flexibility, and it is aimed at preventing cardiovascular diseases. Zhong et al. reported an open-book-like TENG which could obtain a rectified open voltage of 650 V via harvesting water energy.42 In this work, many TENG units are covered, which can be integrated into a limited space to improve output performance. Via optimizing and improving their structures, the rapid development and widespread application of TENGs can be realized. However, processes with multiple steps from manufacturing to assembly are intricate and time-consuming, limiting the further development of TENGs and preventing high efficiency and industrialization.
The recent development of 3D printing technology has shown potential for the low-cost fabrication of multi-functional wearable electronics across many fields, such as the automotive industry, healthcare, monitoring, etc.43–51 This technology can provide a continuous approach for the revolutionary prototyping and fabrication of various electronics with distinctive structures, including micro-patterned devices, stretchable electrodes, integrated functional frames, etc. A typical TENG device always contains four components: triboelectric layers; attached electrodes; a system frame; and additional parts. The structures of these different components play a key role in the performance of the resulting assembled TENG. Both the electrical output and the application scenarios can be affected by the component structures. The excellent combination of 3D printing technology and TENGs enables us to obtain the fast and low-cost fabrication of energy harvesters and self-powered sensors (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  A schematic overview of the field of 3D-printed TENGs. 
Herein, we cover the recent advances in 3D printing technology that can be applied to the different structural components of TENGs, including triboelectric layers, electrodes, device frames, and additional parts. The first half of the article mainly compares the roles of different 3D printing methods for the preparation of TENG components according to their principles. Most types of energy in particular scenarios must be harvested with TENGs with distinctive structures. We introduced and highlighted a series of TENGs based on 3D printing for various energy-harvesting and functional scenarios, such as from wind-, water-, biomechanical-, vibration-, and sound-based sources. Finally, we also discuss the current challenges and future development trends relating to TENGs and their 3D printing. 3D printing technology will open promising paths for the low-cost and fast preparation of various functional TENGs. We believe this review article is not just a summary of various TENGs based on 3D printing but, more importantly, it provides guidelines for the broad functional application of TENGs with various structures.
2. The role of 3D printing technology in assembling TENGs
2.1 Principles of TENGs and 3D printing technology

2.1.1 Basic operating modes of TENGs. 
Compared to other NGs, TENGs show promising potential for a broad number of applications due to their different operating modes and structures (Fig. 2). Vertical contact-separation (CS) mode is the most common and typical working mechanism, involving two dissimilar dielectric materials on which electrodes are deposited. Due to the different electron affinities, physical contact between the two dielectric materials will produce equal and opposite charges on the surfaces. When the two materials are separated by force, free electrons in the two electrodes will be driven by a potential drop, resulting in the production of current. TENGs based on contact-separation mode have a simple structure, show large instantaneous output power, and can be easily prepared and integrated. Unlike contact-separation mode, the relative displacement of a lateral sliding (LS) mode generator is along the direction parallel to the dielectric materials. There will be a potential difference between the two corresponding electrodes, which drives electron flow between the upper and lower electrodes, resulting in an AC output as a result of sliding separation and closure.52 It is worth noting that sliding mode has higher output voltages than contact separation mode.53 This is because the separation of the two electrodes in this mode no longer requires a space interval. LS-TENGs are easily designed as package structures, but the repeated sliding contact will lead to significant wear of the contact surfaces. The upper charged object of a single electrode (SE) mode generator can move freely without the attached electrode, and the local electric field distribution will change during movement. In this mode, a periodic electric potential difference will be formed between the lower electrode and the ground, promoting the flow of electrons.54 The moving electric layer can be based on various materials that are common in daily life, including human skin, shoe soles, high-speed rolling wheels, etc. SE mode simplifies the TENG structure and expands the actual application range. However, the output power in SE-TENG mode is only half that of the corresponding two-electrode mode generator. There is an independent layer and a pair of stationary electrodes in freestanding (FT) mode. The reciprocating movement of a charged object between the two dielectric layers will generate a potential difference between the two electrodes, driving electrons through an external circuit. The charged object moving in this mode does not need to directly contact the surface of the dielectric layer, so wear on the surface of the material can be effectively reduced, improving the durability of the triboelectric nanogenerator.55 Compared with single-electrode mode, the preparation and working processes of freestanding-mode-based devices are more convenient and they have higher energy conversion efficiencies. The various operating modes of TENGs mentioned above require paths for the design and preparation of different structures to achieve various functional applications. Hence, low-cost, fast, and convenient TENG manufacturing processes require development.

2.1.2 Various 3D printing technologies. 
3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing (AM), was first reported in 1986 for commerce.56 These manufacturing techniques can produce high-precision three-dimensional products through adding either liquid or solid materials in a layer-by-layer manner, following preset programs and digital models. In detail, the process of 3D printing generally includes the following steps. Beginning with a pre-designed model obtained using computer-assisted design (CAD) software (Auto CAD, 3ds Max, SolidWorks, etc.), customizable complex structures can be constructed in the x, y, and z dimensions. Then, specific slicing software is used to transform the 3D digital model into code recognized by a 3D printer, ensuring precise printing parameters, such as the printing path, printing consumables, etc. Finally, controlling the printing materials for photocuring or stacking based on CAD, the 3D printer can convert the three-dimensional graphics into real three-dimensional objects. Different from traditional mold production processes, 3D printing technology is based on the inverse process of tomography. Tomography is to “cut” something into countless superimposed pieces, while 3D printing uses continuous physical layers to generate a three-dimensional entity layer by layer. 3D printing has attracted more attention due to its design flexibility and the ability to realize complex structures at high resolution. Compared with traditional printing and manufacturing technologies,57 3D printing can provide higher accuracy 3D products via a fully automated process. For the manufacturing of TENGs, 3D printing technology mainly involves innovations relating to materials or structures. Considering that the triboelectric properties of a material are a crucial factor in the output performance of a TENG, Fig. 3 lists the relative positions in the triboelectric series of 3D printable materials for forming triboelectric material layers. According to the operating mode, material selection, and required application, various TENGs with distinct structures can be printed using different technologies, including fused deposition manufacturing (FDM) technology, photocuring technology, and direct ink writing (DIW) technology.

2.2 TENG components printed via different 3D printing technologies

2.2.1 TENG components printed via FDM. 
FDM is the most widely used approach for printing various thermoplastic polymers, such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polylactic acid (PLA), and polyurethane (PU).58 Generally, the process of FDM will go through three stages, as follows: (i) the construction of a custom digital model using software for practical applications, such as Auto CAD or 3ds Max; (ii) the importing of the G codes of the above digital model to the FDM printer using some slicing software; and (iii) printing the final product based on G codes via polymer heating, extrusion, and cooling in a 3D printer. In this process, polymers can be solidified rapidly to construct components with custom structures. The rapid manufacturing characteristics of FDM can provide a simple method for preparing different TENG components with custom structures.
Many polymers that can be printed using FDM are also suitable as triboelectric layers. Qiao et al. directly printed nylon (PA) and a mixture of polypropylene and polyethylene (PP/PE) onto glass substrates to assemble TENGs (Fig. 4a). In this work, different parameters can be easily adjusted via FDM technology, including the contact angle and filling rate. Once these parameters are changed, different macrostructures are constructed on the triboelectric layer to affect the electrical output performance of the TENG. As seen in Fig. 4b, different contact angles (0°, 45°, and 90°) corresponded to output voltage changes (241 V, 210 V, and 218 V, respectively). The influence of the filling rate (from 100% to 20%), thickness (from 0.4 to 0.2 mm), and widths of the zigzag patterns (from 3 to 7 mm) on the voltage was explored upon choosing an appropriate contact angle (Fig. 4c–e). The results showed that decreases in the filling ratio, filling thickness, and widths of zigzag patterns can effectively increase the contact area of the triboelectric layer and significantly improve the output performance.59 Most materials that can be printed via FDM are in the middle of the triboelectric series, resulting in TENGs with medium-level electrical outputs when composed of these materials. He et al. proposed a novel method to rapidly prepare TENGs with excellent performance via introducing a core–shell structure. In detail, PA tubes with a sponge-like porous micro/nanostructure, formed via removing interior polyethylene glycol (PEG), acted as the tribo-positive layer. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with better electronegativity is pumped into PE tubes as a tribo-negative layer (Fig. 4f). Simultaneously, triboelectric layers with different line patterns (polylinear, linear, and flat), which were directly 3D printed using the above materials, showed high output voltages (∼306 V) (Fig. 4g). Different from traditional FDM 3D printing, this novel method could not only achieve the construction of micro/nanostructures in the tribo-layer but it could also expand the range of suitable materials without the limitations of filament formation. The output voltage of PA-PE/PDMS printed via this method is higher than those of PA/cellulose-PE/PDMS and PA-PE/poly(1,1-difluoroethylene) (PVDF) (Fig. 4h).60 To further discuss the effects of this novel method, Fig. 4i shows the output performances of TENGs fabricated via new and traditional FDM methods. The results show that this method improved the porosity of PA-PE leading to better compression between the two triboelectric films. Although it is hard to directly apply some biomass materials (e.g., lignin and chitosan (CTS)) in TENGs due to issues relating to insolubility and non-melting, these bio-materials can be used to quickly fabricate tribo-positive layers based on this modified process. With a frequency of 30 Hz and a power of 3.5 W, the optimum electric performance of TENG resulted in an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 308 V.61

The electrodes of TENGs can also be printed via FDM. Mallineni et al. incorporated graphene into PLA to improve its electrical conductivity, making it possible to use PLA as an electrode. Electrically conducting graphene-PLA (gPLA) filaments were 3D printed onto polyimide (or Kapton) below its glass transition temperature (Tg = 55 °C), and a Teflon sheet is then attached to the electrode (Fig. 5a). The presence of graphene in PLA not only enhances the triboelectric charge density but it also supports the structural stability of the electrode. The relationship between the output voltage of W-TENG and the thickness of the printed g-PLA electrode layer was also analyzed, and the maximum output voltage is greater than 2 kV (Fig. 5b).62

In the actual assembly of TENGs, interfacial compatibility between the triboelectric layer and the conductor can be poor due to Young's modulus mismatch. Under external cyclic stretching, the delamination of the friction layer and electrode leads to output performance degradation. To further optimize the deformability and mechanical durability of TENGs, Parida et al. developed a thermoplastic elastomer composite material based on 3D printing technology. The elastomer can be used as a matrix for liquid metal and silver flakes to construct a triboelectric layer with inner electrodes. In this work, polyurethane acrylate (PUA) and the conductor (PUA + silver + liquid metal) were directly printed using a 3D printer (Hyrel 3D, USA). PUA was uniformly extruded through a needle with an inner diameter of 0.5 mm under temperature and pressure control and then cured at room temperature without additional time. Because of the highly viscous conductor (PUA + Ag + liquid metal), a lower printing speed is necessary during the printing process. This method of embedding conductive materials in an elastomer matrix can significantly improve the TENG stretchability and prevent the delamination of triboelectric layers and electrodes.63
Some additional TENG components printed via FDM, other than electrodes and triboelectric layers, could also be used for improving electrical output performance. Seol et al. designed an all-printed TENG (AP-TENG) made of PLA. There are two cases, two springs and a core oscillator in the AP-TENG, as shown in Fig. 5c. This core–shell structure can help to improve energy conversion efficiency.64 As Fig. 5d presents, a portable device printed from PLA was designed with a customized PDMS surface structure. It is significant that the electrical output performance can be enhanced through fabricating a PDMS layer with the desired thickness and morphology (Fig. 5e).65 Similarly, Lee et al. reported a fully packaged TENG printed from ABS to cancel noise. In detail, the PDMS ball mold and TENG framework are prepared via FDM printing technology. After the PDMS balls were peeled from the molds, they were put into the framework to assemble the TENG (Fig. 5f). The TENG output performance could be easily optimized via adjusting the surface roughness of the PDMS molds.66 In addition, Kim et al. printed different PDMS supports via FDM to optimize the electrical output. PDMS supports with different angles can change the uniformity of two triboelectric materials. Compared with a flat support, there was a 600% improvement in the voltage and current.67


2.2.2 TENG components printed via photocuring technology. 
Although there are many components with distinctive structures that can be easily printed using FDM, its low resolution is a major challenge for more refined TENGs.68 Light-curing 3D printing technology based on the cross-linking polymerization of light-curable materials could be a great solution to the above challenge. According to different molding methods, this technology can be divided into stereolithography (SLA),69 mask projection stereolithography (MPSLA),70 and PolyJet 3D printing technology.71
SLA technology can be used to prepare some fine molds and flexible substrates to optimize the output performances of TENGs using various photosensitive resins under an ultraviolet laser beam. Fig. 6a shows the 3D-printing-based fabrication process of a TENG based on elastomeric PU (EPU). Although EPU can sustain high mechanical deformation, it does not have a high surface charge density due to its low dielectric constant. A perylene AF4 layer is deposited on the EPU support to construct a conformal coating which can capture a lot of surface charge after the corona charging process (Fig. 6b).72 In addition, using a mold with a microstructured array printed via SLA is a simple and fast way to increase the surface roughness of the PDMS triboelectric layer. Zhang et al. built a 3D-printed mold via a SL process and then cast PDMS film. The roughness of the PDMS film surface was improved by using a SL mold, resulting in a TENG output that was about 2.5-times that of a flat surface. A schematic description of this process is exhibited in Fig. 6c.73 Similarly, He et al. designed a 30 × 30 square grid frame using epoxy acrylate material via SL. In this work, the resolution of the SL machine is ±0.1 mm.74 Aluminum balls with a size of 1–2 mm filled the frame as a tribo-positive layer and as oscillators (Fig. 6d).

Different from the point curing SLA method, MPSLA technology improves the printing efficiency via projecting the entire section at once. Nowadays, mostly MPSLA approaches use digital micromirror device (DMD)-based digital light processing (DLP) technology as the projection equipment. Yoon et al. used a DLP 3D printer and the commercial photopolymerization resin ABS to prepare a biomimetic villus-structure-based TENG (BV-TENG) (Fig. 6e). The diameter and height of the fabricated cylindrical structure are 42 mm and 38 mm, respectively. Commercial polytetrafluoroethylene powder samples with average particle sizes of 0.1, 10, and 500 μm were used as triboelectric materials, having better contact with the ABS cylindrical structure. In vertical direction mode and rotation direction mode, the power output performance was improved 5-fold and 4-fold, respectively. Based on the high charge density formed between the ABS surface and the PTFE powder, a dust removal system was designed to effectively adsorb dust particles with different particle sizes.75
The principle of the PolyJet method is similar to inkjet printing, involving the ejection of thousands of photopolymer droplets onto the platform and then curing via UV.76 It is one of the fastest and most accurate 3D printing technologies currently available. However, only a few materials can be used as triboelectric materials and this technology is closed source. Rubber-like TangoBlack (TB) is an excellent dielectric material with various grades of elastic material characteristics, which can be adapted for the construction of triboelectric layers. Fig. 6f demonstrates a TENG with a vertical contact structure fabricated via PolyJet technology using TB and polyamide (PA 2200).77 With the help of this technology, TENG parts with smooth surfaces and precise dimensions can be manufactured. Zhu et al. utilized a multi-material 3D printer (Objet350, Stratasys Ltd, USA) for fabricating a soft robotic finger, where a TENG as a curvature sensor is placed on top of the finger (Fig. 6g). In this process, the positive layer and soft body are constructed from AgilusBlack, and PDMS was chosen as the negative layer.78 Since PolyJet technology provides micro-layer resolution and a minimum accuracy of 0.1 mm, 3D printers can directly print out surface patterns made of cuboids and pyramids to simplify the production process.


2.2.3 TENG components printed via DIW. 
Generally, greater versatility and better material diversity are major features of DIW technology.79 It is an alternative approach that allows programmed structural design, the creation of high-performance tribo-materials, and a simplified prototyping process for TENG applications. In a DIW-based printing process, polymer gels or dilute colloidal suspensions can be continuously extruded at high shear rates. When the shear force disappears after deposition, the shape of the printed part will be maintained, and then it is thermally cured to cross-link the thermosetting materials. Only materials with a shear thinning effect can be printed via DIW, and there are various additives for adjusting the rheological behavior, such as nanomaterials, epoxy thermosets, metal particles, ceramic particles, etc.
Typically, silicone elastomers, in the form of inks, are suitable for constructing triboelectric layers due to their fast curing times and high elastic deformation. Viscoelastic silicone inks can be directly extruded through the nozzle tip, forming a triboelectric layer with regular microstructures on Al foil (Fig. 7a). Via adjusting the thicknesses of the layers and the distances between adjacent fibers, the triboelectric performances of devices can be improved (Fig. 7b). This is because the contact area between the two triboelectric materials can be changed.80 This is an effective strategy for designing and tailoring friction surface structures for flexible, stretchable, and wearable TENGs. Combined with a silicone elastomer as a triboelectric material, Ahmed et al. introduced a stretchable and metal-free TENG, which was entirely fabricated via 3D printing technology.81 As shown in Fig. 7c, poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene)–poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was extruded and deposited on UV curable silicone via 3D printing as an electrode. Considering that the performance of the printed component depends on the properties of the ink, PEDOT:PSS should be added to dimethyl sulfate (DMS) and additional water should be evaporated to increase the conductivity and viscosity. A silicone layer with a microstructured pattern is prepared using a customized print head system, which consists of a pneumatic pump and a switchable solenoid for controlling the flow of ink. Using single electrode mode, the TENG can generate electricity when snow particles contact with the silicone surface. Qiang et al. offered a transparent egg-white hydrogel (EWH), which possesses high compliance with and sensitivity to stretching, bending, and compression.82 Meanwhile, the EWH as a shear-thinning ink could be directly 3D printed at room temperature without UV curing, rheology modification, or free-radical polymerization. Because of its physical crosslinking under an alkaline environment, the EWH exhibited shear-thinning and self-healing properties, which are critical for DIW. The direct 3D-printed EWH was then sandwiched between two layers of Ecoflex to make a TENG (Fig. 7d).

Most products printed with silicone rubber do not have high resolution or strong mechanical strength due to their low viscosities, and they require some additives to improve the rheological behavior. Among these materials, PDMS is a typical elastomeric material with high electronegativity and resilience, but it cannot be directly printed via DIW. Roh et al. showed a 3D printing PDMS ink whose precursor binds microbeads via capillarity, forming a thixotropic extrudable gel-like phase. After extrusion onto the substrate, the liquid PDMS binding the microbeads is cured via crosslinking to construct TENG components.83 Qian et al. fabricated an all-printed TENG (AP-TENG) with a 3D micro/nano-hierarchically patterned structure (Fig. 8a). In this work, gaseous silica was added into the PDMS ink to optimize the rheological behavior.84 In addition, cellulose nanofiber (CNF) inks show the desired apparent viscosity and shear-thinning behavior and they could be printed via DIW to form tribo-positive layers. Via controlling the number of layers and the angle difference between the parallel filaments of adjacent layers, triboelectric layers with different patterns can be prepared via DIW. Compared with traditional flat TENGs, these microporous and elastic 3D architectures printed via DIW show a boosted voltage output via increasing the contact area and mechanical resilience. Zheng et al. used PTFE micropowder as an additive in PDMS precursors to prepare DIW inks.85 The chemical inertness of the PTFE powder avoids the hardening of the matrix caused by fumed silica. In detail, as shown in Fig. 8b, this ink was obtained via simply mixing a liquid PDMS prepolymer, a curing agent, and PTFE micro-powder. Via optimizing the ratio of the curing agent to prepolymer in the ink, a composite with good elasticity and increased electron affinity was prepared. Fig. 8d demonstrates a novel 3D printing process for constructing PDMS-based coaxial stretchable fibers.86 The rheological properties of the inks are adjusted through filling with PTFE particles and graphene, resulting in higher viscosity at a low shear rate (Fig. 8c). The PTFE filler could also improve the electron affinity of PDMS. Conductive electrodes were integrated into this coaxial structure, avoiding complex structure assembly. Based on conductive PDMS/graphene and insulative PDMS/PTFE elastomers, a 3D-printed TENG textile can be used as a tactile sensor and it shows great potential for wearable applications. Similarly, a single integrated triboelectric layer and electrode were assembled into a biomass-based degradable TENG based on the above principle. Although the thermoset elastomer poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) is an outstanding sustainable material, it is difficult to maintain its original shape at high temperatures. As shown in Fig. 8e, carbon nanotubes (CNT) and salt particles were added to PGS as reinforcing fillers. It is worth noting that these fillers can act as conductive materials and sacrificial templates, respectively.87 Compared with traditional molded microporous TENG counterparts, the combination of DIW and salt particles achieved TENGs with higher output performance due to the hierarchical porous structures on the millimeter scale (Fig. 8f).

In addition, gradient composite materials with adjustable elastic moduli can be used to manufacture TENGs with high stimulus responses. The combination of DIW technology and graded multi-materials promotes structural complexity and functionality, providing a robust way to overcome the lack of manufacturing tools for both tunable mechanical gradients and complex architectures. Chen et al. utilized a dynamic photomask-assisted DIW method with single-nozzle 3D printing to design a mechanically responsive multilevel TENG (m-TENG).88 A nanocomposite ink containing a photocurable resin and thermally curable resin with fumed silica was used to construct the TENG components, and then its mechanical properties were enhanced following second-stage thermal curing, forming an interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) (Fig. 9a). Components printed from this ink have controllable buckling order, controllable crack paths, or sequential shape memory behavior. In each layer, the conductive Ni cloth is sandwiched between a polymer matrix and an adhesive-backed chemical-resistant slippery PTFE film to construct a tribo-positive layer. Another piece of Ni cloth was directly attached to the top side as a tribo-negative layer, shown in Fig. 9b.

Some nanomaterials could also be directly printed via DIW as TENG components. Peng et al. reported a DIW 3D-printed graphene electrode for a TENG made of an ultralight biomimetic hierarchical graphene material (BHGM).89 This hierarchical cellular structure shows significant compression performance (Fig. 9c) upon controlling the proportions of ascorbic acid (AA) aqueous solution and graphite oxide (GO) sheet suspension and adjusting the microstructure. In this work, the lightweight BHGM with good compressive resilience was used as an electrode (Fig. 9d). Steven et al. designed a switch with a prescribed pattern using viscous silver nanoparticle conductive ink (Fig. 9e) and this was integrated into a TENG.90 When the switch was triggered by the sliding mode TENG, a current would pass through the fuse, causing it to break (Fig. 9f).


2.2.4 TENG components printed via hybrid 3D printing technology. 
With the development of 3D printing technology, a single 3D printing process cannot always meet more functional requirements due to raw material limitations. Seol et al. reported an all-3D-printed TENG integrating multiple printing methods, such as FDM, SLA, SLM, etc.91Fig. 10a illustrates the composition of the 3D-printed TENG, including the case, electrode layer, (EL), and triboelectric layer (TL). A grated disk structure was prepared via various 3D-printing processes, and ABS, PLA, methyl methacrylate (MMA), and nylon were used in the triboelectric layer, and Al, Ti, and PTFE were selected as the electrode layers. The materials and printing methods for each component are presented in Table 1. Upon characterizing the output performances of different triboelectric pairs, nylon exhibits the highest electropositive performance and PTFE exhibits the highest electronegative performance (Fig. 10b). Likewise, Haque et al. proposed a 3D-printed multi-material TENG based on vertical contact mode (Fig. 10c).77 Components printed from TangoBlack through multi-jet modeling (MJM) were used as the tribo-positive layer, and PTFE was chosen as the tribo-negative material (Table 2). A schematic description of the 3D-printing process to fabricate a self-powered touch sensor is shown in Fig. 10d. Optimizing the TENG geometry, materials, structure, and design via integrating various 3D-printing technologies is a direction of further research.

3. 3D-printed TENGs with various structures for different applications
The TENG output performance, working durability, and preparation largely rely on the TENG structure. Using well-designed structures (pendulum-like,35,93 sea-snake-like,94 timbo-like,95 clock-pointer-like,96etc.), some negative effects can be reduced (excessive abrasion, the effects of dielectric shielding, etc.), which can improve the TENG energy conversion efficiency and robustness. Therefore, it is very desirable to produce TENGs with high-precision, complex, and personalized structures through the use of 3D-printing technology. Based on the effective conversion of diverse types of external mechanical energy (wind, water waves, human motion, vibration, and sound),97–101 3D-printed TENGs with different structures could meet the various requirements of wearable devices, particular in the areas of monitoring, industrial production, and other fields. Table 3 summarizes various 3D-printed TENG structures based on the conversion of different types of energy.

3.1 Structures for wind energy
Wind energy has turned out to be an alternative to fossil fuels, owing to its ubiquity, clean nature, and rich abundance. Traditional wind-energy harvesters (e.g., wind turbines) are limited by their large sizes, high wear, and high installation costs, and they need further improvement.102 Therefore, various wind-based TENGs have been developed as sustainable green power sources. These current wind-energy devices generally were designed using various structures, working through the wind-induced periodic motion of triboelectric film. The addition of 3D printing technology can better realize structural design, allowing miniaturization, diversification, easy installation, and low manufacturing costs. Fig. 11a shows a hybrid nanogenerator (MW-HNG) consisting of a TENG, piezoelectric nanogenerator (PENG), and electromagnetic generator (EMG) to harvest wind energy.103 The fully enclosed structure of the MW-HNG was fabricated via 3D-printing technology, and it can effectively convert natural wind energy into electrical energy via rotational motion. The windmill body, fan structure, and rotating middle beam (which is printed from ABS) were finally enclosed in an external frame. When the wind blows, the top 3D-printed wind turbine begins to rotate (the hemispherical cup structure), resulting in two different triboelectric materials (PTFE and Al) coming into contact and separating continuously. Via combining different types of 3D printing technology, different parts of the MW-TENG can be easily and effectively produced and designed. This 3D printed cylindrical structure shows some excellent advantages, including its relatively small volume, fully enclosed rotating system, and high-efficiency harvesting of wind energy. Furthermore, a MW-TENG based on a venturi system was applied in subway tunnel systems. In detail, a venturi system is mainly made up of three parts: the inlet, outlet, and throat. When natural wind passes, there is low pressure in the throat, forcing the central film to flutter at high frequencies due to this unique design. Based on this phenomenon, and as shown in Fig. 11b, a 3D-printed venturi TENG was developed which can power a sensor nodal network. In this TENG, a flexible PC flag can flutter at different wind speeds. Owing to state-of-the-art 3D-printing technology, the structure of the TENG can be precisely controlled and arbitrarily customized.104Fig. 11c compares the output voltages of three different sizes of TENG. Large-sized devices (40 cm × 12 cm × 12 cm) are conducive to generating higher power, while miniaturized devices (7.5 cm × 2.1 cm × 2.1 cm) make installation easier. Wang et al. proposed a novel multi-functional TENG that can be used as a wind barrier in transportation.105 The channel frame was printed from PLA and Cu electrodes were then coated onto the upper and lower surfaces. Thereafter, FEP was fixed onto the 3D-printed units as a triboelectric layer (Fig. 11d). Via integrating 66 TENG units connected in parallel to form a wind barrier, the multi-functional TENG shows a great improvement in windshield efficiency and output power. In fact, the geometrical dimensions and vibrational parameters of the FEP membrane directly affect the electrical output performance of the TENG unit. Traditional preparation methods are time-consuming and complex, while 3D-printing technology can optimize the structure and solve the above problems. A multilayered cylindrical TENG (MC-TENG) fabricated via 3D printing was proposed for environmental monitoring and forest-fire alarm applications.106 The MC-TENG consisted of two sleeve components, and 3D-printed discs are shown in Fig. 11e. Cu and PTFE films are pasted onto the surfaces of the cylindrical shells in a proper sequence to make triboelectric layers. This multilayered cylindrical sleeve structure can not only enhance space utilization but the device can also relatively easily undergo sliding under the motion of tree branches induced by wind.

3.2 Structures for water-wave energy
Water-wave energy, which is vast and barely dependent on the external environment, can provide a more reliable source of power than wind.107 The structural optimization of wave-energy harvesters is focused on decreasing the dielectric shielding effect from water and improving space utilization and corrosion resistance.108–110 An enclosed TENG with an air-gap structure was designed, which could overcome the negative effects of charges in ionic ocean saltwater. As shown in Fig. 12a, An et al. introduced a whirling-folded TENG (WF-TENG) to harvest water-wave energy, and its flexible vortex frame structure was printed from PLA. Because of the good mechanical properties of PLA, the structure is sufficiently flexible. When the internal mass block was triggered by an underwater wave impact, the interlayer Cu and FEP film can contact and separate to generate an electric output. This whirling-folded structure can easily respond to various forms of wave excitation. Fig. 12b illustrates the working principle of contact separation induced by external water waves in different directions. Based on this design, the relationship between the water-wave parameters and the TENG output performance can be clearly expressed. The use of a multi-layer structure has always been an effective way to increase the output power of TENGs.111Fig. 12c demonstrates a multilayered water-wave energy harvester based on a 3D-printed TENG.112 The tower-like TENG (T-TENG) has multiple units composed of PTFE balls and nylon film attached to the 3D-printed arc surface. Fig. 12e shows a comparison of the electrical outputs of arc surfaces with different curvatures. The results suggest that an arc with smaller curvature has a lower resonance frequency. Thus, a structure with a flatter surface is more conducive to increasing the electrical output. The greatest benefit of the T-TENG is that it can utilize 3D-printing technology to optimize the arc surface, which results in higher conversion efficiencies when harvesting water-wave energy in arbitrary directions. In addition, because of this distinctive multilayered structure and integrated method, compared to previous works, the power density of the T-TENG can achieve a linear increase with the number of units without the use of rectifiers (Fig. 12d).

3.3 Structures for biomechanical energy
As one of the most common but usually wasted types of mechanical energy in our daily life, biomechanical energy from human body motion provides a potential way for powering wearable devices. To attach well to the human body, such as via integration into clothes or shoes, the power sources of wearable devices must have high flexibility and shape-adaption. Chen et al. introduced a facile method for fabricating a 3D-printed ultra-flexible TENG to collect biomechanical energy to provide a sustainable power source.113 The UV-curable ink and support material were printed smoothly via a hybrid 3D-printing system to form a three-dimensional hollow structure (Fig. 13a). The triboelectric material and electrode, respectively, were a printed resin and ionic hydrogel, so the TENG can adapt to any deformation as a result of external force (Fig. 13b). Due to the contact area being improved by a columnar array of triboelectric interfaces, the TENG can produce a uniform high peak power output of 10.98 W m−3 per unit volume and transferred charge of 0.65 mC m−3 per unit volume to power portable systems in wearable devices. To scavenge wrist motion energy from swinging, a 3D-printed tubular WHEM-TENG was reported. In this TENG, a 3D-printed ABS tube was wrapped with four ring-shaped Al electrodes and two copper coils (Fig. 13c). Then, a magnetic neodymium ball was placed into the ABS tube to assemble a TENG. Owing to the single-electrode-based structure of the TENG, the moving object (magnet) rolls rather than slides, reducing the friction and contact force. In addition, this work introduced a thin PTFE film to form a PTFE-ABS layer and increase the triboelectric potential. Herein, 3D-printing methods could be used to fabricate angular structures and reduce total processing costs.114 This work focused on a single form of human locomotion, but the fully enclosed 3D-printed hybridized electromagnetic TENG (FEHN) was subsequently redesigned to harvest any kind of wrist motion, including shaking, twisting, waving, etc. The PTFE-ABS layer was replaced by a PDMS-PLA layer, and an extra-thin flexible concentrating material was introduced to enhance the electromagnetic induction (Fig. 13d). The FEHN delivered an average power density of 0.118 mW cm−3 and paved the way to develop self-powered body-worn electronic devices.115 Similarly, Rahman et al. presented a miniaturized freestanding kinetic-impact-based hybridized nanogenerator (MFKI-HNG) consisting of an electromagnetic generator (EMG) and a freestanding-mode TENG116 (Fig. 13e). In detail, the EMG is made of three parts: a freestanding cylindrical magnet, a 3D-printed hollow cylindrical tube, and two helical springs. The freestanding TENG used modified PTFE film as the triboelectric layer and an interdigitated aluminum electrode as the electric layer, which were attached to the inner wall and cylindrical-shaped magnet. Under external vibration, the magnet oscillates back and forth in the hollow tube to harvest sliding friction energy under external vibration. Herein, the EMG and TENG are reasonably integrated into a system using a 3D-printed cylindrical structure design to enhance the output performance.

Considering the advantages of sliding mode (high energy-conversion efficiency and no air gap in the internal structure), it is more suitable for human-motion wearable sensors. The traditional sliding mode has a shortcoming in that when the moving stage moves back and forth, only one electrical output is generated. This means that energy from the moving stage sliding backward is wasted. Fig. 13f shows a schematic illustration of a patch-type TENG, which further optimized the structure and enhanced the contact uniformity to achieve efficient bidirectional mechanical-energy harvesting. One supporting part used photopolymer resin solution as the material for SLA 3D printing to guide the movement of the moving stage. The other supporting layer, used to reduce friction and make the moving process smooth, was fabricated using an FDM-based 3D printer from ABS. The TENG with ideal bidirectional movement could be attached to an arm at an angle (θ) to demonstrate its capabilities as an energy harvester during human walking (Fig. 13g and h).117
3.4 Structures for vibrational motion energy
Vibrational motion widely exists in the natural environment, and it could be harvested to supply electricity for motion-monitoring sensors. Traditionally, the structures of most vibrational energy harvesters rely on the support of spring components, which limits the working bandwidths and directions of vibration, resulting in the unsuitable detection of motion in various directions or large vibration changes. Xiao et al. proposed a honeycomb structure-inspired triboelectric nanogenerator (HIS-TENG) without a spring.118 A honeycomb frame with 55 grooves was fabricated using 3D technology (Fig. 14a). In each groove, a PTFE ball was added to serve as the oscillator and triboelectric layer. It is worth noting that the size of each PTFE ball is 5 mm, and 3D-printing technology is undoubtedly convenient and fast for the preparation of this miniaturized and dense structure. In comparison with a square-grid structure, the honeycomb structure has a larger effective contact area and a maximum power density that is increased by 43.2% at the same volume (Fig. 14b). This HIS-TENG can be employed as a highly effective vibrational energy sensor to monitor engine condition, and it overcomes the shortcomings of spring-assisted TENGs that only work near the natural frequency.

Another 3D-printed friction-free TENG (FF-TENG) for harvesting vibrational energy was proposed. As shown in Fig. 14c, there are four parts: an oscillator, a pair of pillars, a pair of electrodes, and four magnets. The frame, oscillator, and pair of pillars were fabricated via 3D printing from ABS. This structure aims to ensure that the PTFE film pasted on the surface of the oscillator can effectively contact the Al electrodes. Fig. 14d shows the three working principles of the FF-TENG at different input frequencies: partial-contact mode, full-contact mode, and rotation mode (R-mode). Basic indicators of device performance in different working modes were systematically analyzed. It is confirmed that the device has high sensitivity and suitability for the monitoring of natural disasters, such as earthquakes.119
Owing to the irregular changes of vibrational motion, it is necessary to explore non-resonant vibrational energy harvesters that function in all directions. Bhatta et al. reported an excellent 3D-printed geometric-structure configuration that converts wasted vibrational energy in arbitrary directions into electrical energy.120 The internal components of the hybrid nanogenerator include an electromagnetic generator (EMG) and interdigitated TENG. The EMG was made of a free-sliding axially magnetized central magnet and top and bottom coils. At the same time, the hollow cylinder consists of four sector-shaped Cu electrodes, PTFE, and Al layers with nanostructured surfaces. The entire structure was printed from PLA and this TENG in free-standing mode can induce a voltage when the magnet is shaken back and forth under external vibration. The direction of the alternating current signal depended on the electrode position when it was subjected to vibration. Based on this principle, a self-powered 3D-printed sensor can detect different motion signals along the X, Y, and Z axes. Wang et al. designed a multifunctional triboelectric motion sensor (MMS) using 3D-printing technology from the perspective of structural optimization.121 A polyurethane (PU) ball was placed in a hollow cylindrical 3D-printed shell to assemble the TENG. Transparent resin was selected as the printing material and seven copper electrodes were coated on the inner walls of the shell. Then, PTFE film was assembled on the electrodes to form a triboelectric layer (Fig. 14e). Through the use of a 3D printer, the bottom arc can be easily adjusted without a complex process, which is beneficial to improving the sensitivity of the TENG toward displacement. This structure allows the PU ball to exhibit two working modes of sliding and contact separation in the horizontal and vertical directions. Thus, the TENG can be applied to detect different motion signals, small vibrations, and rotational speeds based on the potential change caused by the PU ball (Fig. 14f).
3.5 Structures for sound energy
Low-frequency micro-sound energy as dissipated energy is more difficult to harvest than general mechanical vibration due to the low input mechanical energy and the complex output signal. Bayindir et al. first proposed a motion- and sound-activated TENG with multilayers (MULTENG).122 The core–shell structure contains six alternating layers obtained through 3D printing to realize a higher total converted energy. As shown in Fig. 15a, the subtle design connects the 3D-printed PLA layers to each other, allowing the high-efficiency harvesting of sound energy. Also, the addition of a rigid area between the layers contributes to better contact between the triboelectric layers, while the six thick PLA layers as a holder have good stability and durability under high cyclic motion. According to the different responses and reactions between the layers of the TENG, various vibrational frequencies arising from motion-based and acoustic sources can be recognized to monitor vehicles driving at different speeds.

Guo et al. reported a new TENG for voiceprint recognition using one-step-molding 3D printing.123 The middle frame is made of polycaprolactone (PCL) as a spacer to guarantee periodic contact-separation between PDMS film and the Al electrode (Fig. 15b). PDMS film will generate an output voltage according to the deformation induced by external sound or vibration. This sensor utilizes 3D-printing technology and paves a new path for recognizing human language. Recently, a 3D-printed TENG with a similar structure was exhibited as a quarter-wavelength acoustic resonator system.124 The structure of the perforated layer used for acoustic wave transmission plays a significant role in the performance of the acoustic triboelectric device. Previously, intrinsically porous materials were hard to manufacture and it was difficult to adjust the pore size, causing viscous loss. To solve these dilemmas mentioned above, a PLA plate mixed with conductive carbon black was fabricated via a FDM 3D-printing technique, in which 96 holes were designed and patterned to prompt acoustic wave transmission and excite FEP membrane vibration (Fig. 15c). The conductive PLA acted as both a positive triboelectric layer and an electrode, while the FEP membrane served as a negative triboelectric layer. The ability to convert acoustic signals into electrical signals shows the practicability of the TENG for real-time speech recognition (Fig. 15d).
3.6 Structures for highly efficient energy harvesting
Rather than increasing the input force or optimizing the input conditions, the structural design of devices to allow highly efficient energy harvesting should be considered as a key point. Among the research into innovative device structures for achieving better electrical output, multilayer structures with multiple units are some of the most common types applied in various self-powered systems. As shown in Fig. 16a, a three-layered structure, including top, middle, and bottom layers, was fabricated from FDM-based ABS.125 PVDF grafted with tert-butyl acrylate (tBA) (18 mol%; referred to as PVDF-G18) and polyimide embedded with barium titanate (PI-BTO) were attached to Al film in the top part as a tribo-negative layer. In addition, stretchable PDMS embedded with Ag NWs was coated as an Au NP electrode at the middle and bottom of the substrate. Via integrating innovative materials, the Isc value of the TENG increased by approximately 21.4% compared with less-optimized TENGs (Fig. 16b). Lee et al. designed a cam-based TENG (C-TENGs) to convert rotational motion into linear movement.126 Circular frames with different numbers of noses were also made via 3D-printing technology (Fig. 16c). This structure contains a cam and a bumper spring, and it can improve the electrical output via adjusting the spring constant ratio between the spacer and bumper springs. Based on the precise resolution of the 3D printer, small components can be quickly manufactured, such as single-, dual-, and quad-nose components. The output power is improved as the number of cam noses increases, as shown in Fig. 16d. This integrated C-TENG (Fig. 16e) will generate a high output voltage (∼350 V) at 400 rpm over 210000 cycles, powering a bicycle with 180 LEDs, demonstrating bright prospects for industrial applications.126

Structural stability is a major parameter that always influences mechanical system performance, and corresponding sensors are required to be embedded into the interiors of machines. The TENG must be flexible and able to generate voltages as high as possible in a limited space. Fig. 16f exhibits a flexure-hinge-based TENG (FH-TENG) obtained via 3D printing with excellent structural integration and stability.127 The FH-TENG is composed of a two-layer flexure hinge (37 mm × 30 mm × 13.5 mm) and a triboelectric layer (FEP film and EVA foam). Because of programmed digital design via 3D-printing technology, the FH-TENG (Fig. 16g) can be easily integrated into a bearing pedestal to monitor axis deviation. As the axis deviations increase, the electrical output of the FH-TENG also increases (Fig. 16h).
In industrial production, stable and robust TENGs with high electrical output are urgently required for use in electro-Fenton (EF) technology, and their power properties depend on the device structure. 3D-printing technology can optimize the TENG performance through the design of specific geometric structures using flexible materials. Tian et al. designed a flexible vesicle-like TENG using a one-step 3D-printing process, and its structure can promote the electrical output of the TENG (1.95 W m2; 375 μA).128 This multi-unit elastic TENG consists of a soft substrate and a triboelectric layer (copper foil/PTFE film) (Fig. 17a). Every unit contains two flexible rhombic units assembled from twelve pairs of triboelectric layers, and the entire structure is printed via FDM using a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE). Owing to the individualized multi-unit design, the boosted electric output of the PE-TENG is capable of driving an EF system without external power. Similarly, Zhu et al. upgraded and optimized the self-driven EF process using the same materials and 3D-printing methods for catalyzing methylene blue (MB) degradation. In detail, TPE filaments were stacked layer-by-layer to form eight flexible units as substrate supports. Then Al foil and PTFE were pasted in the corresponding positions to act as the metal electrode and triboelectric layer, respectively (Fig. 17b). This flexible wave-like TENG can generate a Voc value of 610 V and a Isc value of 1.93 mA.129

Like the EF system, the electro-reduction of N2 into NH3 is also a sustainable industry that requires huge amounts of energy. Programmable mold formation can be used to design three kinds of TENGs with distinct structures: a PE-TENG (Fig. 17c), a multi-layer linkage TENG (PMLL-TENG) (Fig. 17d), and a multi-layer asway TENG (PMLA) (Fig. 17e). In the PMLL-TENG, copper (100 mm × 90 mm × 110 μm) and PTFE film (100 mm × 90 mm × 110 μm) were adhered to substrates with differently structured triboelectric layers (flat, ladder, arc, and triangular) (Fig. 17f). According to the output power curves, the TENGs with planar and trapezoidal structures have the highest output powers.130
4. Summary and perspectives
In this work, we summarized the progress relating to TENGs based on 3D-printing technology, focusing on the application of various types of 3D-printing technology (FDM, photocuring, and DIW) in the construction of TENG components, including triboelectric layers, attached electrodes, system frames, and additional parts. Although FDM is simply and low-cost, its accuracy is poor and there are few material options; it is only really suitable for printing external frames and auxiliary structures. Compared with DIW, FDM has certain limitations in terms of material diversity. The performances of TENGs printed via DIW greatly depend on the properties of the inks, and it is important to develop inks with better triboelectric properties. Similarly, the printing resolution of DIW also must be improved. It is usually hard to generate high triboelectric charge densities with photosensitive resin materials, resulting in photocuring only really being used to prepare some frames with micro/nanostructures; it has very little involvement in the printing of triboelectric layers and electrodes. In detail, bottlenecks and challenges relating to the 3D printing of TENGs need to be addressed, as follows:
(1) Although there is a large number of works relating to the 3D printing of TENG materials, complex preparation methods and low triboelectric charge densities and conductance are major problems hindering practical applications. Various materials with flexibility or elasticity are required when assembling TENGs, including triboelectric materials, conductive materials, and frame materials. Different 3D printing methods are suitable for different TENG components due to printing material limitations. Hence, few single-material printing processes are universal, and multi-material printing or multi-method combination is required to overcome the above problems. Some current works show future directions. For example, a novel 3D printing approach which can deposit single metals or diverse active material combinations, including ceramic, semiconducting, magnetic, and colloidal materials, onto site-specific 3D layouts to create electronic devices in a single step has been shown.131 Also, a dual-nozzle was used to fabricate multi-material monolithic structures with flexible materials to construct elastic bodies.132
(2) The electrical output performances of TENGs can be affected by the following factors: (a) the triboelectric material and its structure; (b) the electrode and its structure; (c) the operating mode and additional structures related to electricity generation; and (d) the TENG frame and its functional structure. Rarely does research give comprehensive indicators for assessing generator performance based on structural influences. Various structures obtained via 3D printing could promote the output efficiencies of TENGs, and detailed mechanisms should be thoroughly investigated on different scales.
(3) To obtain high printing efficiencies and the industrialization of TENGs based on 3D printing, comprehensive TENG designs that can be printed in one step have become a major goal for future applications. The 3D printing of different TENG components still requires a multi-step process to assemble the product; thus, simplifying the structures of TENGs is a simple way to allow rapid prototyping. For example, Chen et al. prepared a TENG via a 3D-printing process whose contact-separation process occurred in the interior of the triboelectric material.87 The design and customization of various electronic devices can be realized without complicated assembly and molding processes. Assembling different components automatically based on novel printing approaches is also a potential way to prepare TENGs on a large-scale. In addition, the printing time during DIW-type 3D printing relies on the curing times of materials. The optimization of the rheological properties of triboelectric materials will promote the printing efficiencies of TENGs.
(4) There are many novel applications based on 4D-printing technology that present a further evolution of 3D printing. The models involved in 3D-printing technology are static, while 4D-printed objects can perceive changes in the environment and alter their forms according to functional requirements. Meanwhile, 4D-printing technology expands the range of available materials to include smart materials, such as shape memory polymers (SMP), which are capable of self-recovery and self-healing under thermal treatment. There has been research that has introduced this advantage into the fabrication of self-recovering TENGs, which improved the durability and robustness of the device structures.133 It is anticipated that the advance from 3D-printing technology to 4D-printing technology will provide more functional and precise structures for TENGs, promoting output performances and creating devices that are more stable and long-lasting.
In summary, 3D-printing technology is a simple form of technology for the design of various structures for TENG applications. Building on the studies in this review, it is expected that there is the potential for the design of more distinctive TENGs with 3D-printed structures to harvest ambient energy and sensory information.
