    , Accepted 13th February 2020First published on 14th February 2020AbstractWe report a systematic and scalable single-step growth of three-dimensional hierarchical ZnO/ZnS heterojunction branched nanowires (3D ZnO/ZnS h-b-NWs) on a Si substrate using MOCVD for the first time and their application as photoanodes for photoelectrochemical water splitting (PEC-WS). Vertically well-aligned main trunk ZnO nanowires (MTr-ZnO NWs) were grown on a low-temperature ZnO buffer layer, which was followed by ZnS deposition. Subsequently, hierarchically branched ZnO nanowires (h-b-ZnO NWs) were grown on the side wall of the core–shell heterostructure, which was further modified with a thin layer of ZnS for the growth of multiple ZnO NW branches. The PEC-WS results revealed that the photo-conversion efficiency achieved using MTr-ZnO NWs and 3D ZnO/ZnS h-b-NWs was 0.03% and 0.46% at 0.5 V vs. RHE, respectively, which corresponds to 16-fold enhancement. The achieved improvements can be attributed to the enhanced photoabsorption, which is directly related to the augmented surface area. In addition, ZnS plays a significant role in promoting faster photogenerated carrier transport with high efficiency and visible light absorption by type-II transition at the ZnO/ZnS interface. The novel growth approach that we followed to fabricate the photoanode opens a new avenue for the synthesis of multiple-level hierarchical heterostructures that are beneficial for PEC-WS devices.
1. Introduction
Over the past two centuries, energy needs have skyrocketed dramatically, primarily because of the transportation and industrial sectors. Although the available fossil-fuel reserves in the world are limited, they are still relied upon as a rudimentary source of energy.1–5 Fossil fuels, upon combustion, emit CO2 into the atmosphere that, in turn, promotes climate changes and global warming.6 In this regard, it has become imperative to find alternative energy sources that are clean, secure, sustainable, and renewable.6–8 To date, hydrogen has been considered a promising candidate for use as a renewable energy carrier and fuel source because it offers easy storage and transportation. Hydrogen can be generated via several methods, but the solar-driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) water-splitting strategy is the most lucrative among them.9 PEC water splitting is an efficient and promising approach because it is environment friendly owing to the simplicity of its production process.10–14 To perform the process of PEC water splitting, a semiconductor photoelectrode is one of the essential components owing to its separation and transport ability of electron–hole pairs generated by light absorption.15 Numerous types of semiconductor materials including metal oxide semiconductors such as ZnO,8,16,17 TiO2,9,18 BiVO4,19,20 and Fe2O3 (ref. 6 and 21) have been used as photoelectrodes in PEC systems. ZnO, in particular, has attracted tremendous interest as a semiconductor-based photoelectrode for PEC water-splitting devices due to its favourable properties such as low cost with simple and facile synthesis, earth-abundance, a high exciton binding energy (60 meV), and nontoxic as well as environmentally benign source materials.22–27 In addition, ZnO possesses an appropriate band alignment with respect to water redox levels, which makes it a favorable photoelectrode for PEC water-splitting devices.28 However, its large bandgap (Eg = 3.37 eV) prohibits its absorption in the visible light region and results in a low conversion efficiency for PEC water splitting.5,29 Therefore, to improve its PEC performance, several strategies have been employed that include doping, decoration with plasmonic metal nanoparticles (Au or Ag), coating with a narrow bandgap material in the form of a core–shell structure, and synthesis of nanostructures with a varied and controllable morphology.8,30–34
Myriad methods have been adopted to synthesize ZnO nanostructures, including hydrothermal synthesis, thermal metal evaporation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), pulsed laser deposition (PLD), metal–organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), chemical solution routes etc.16,32,35–40 Among these well-accepted growth techniques, there is special interest in advanced growth methods such as MOCVD since it has numerous advantages such as reproducibility, mechanical stability, excellent crystallinity, and good uniformity. In addition, it can provide high quality with very complicated structures in a single-step fabrication such as three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical ZnO (h-ZnO) nanowire (NW) arrays.
Recently, 3D h-ZnO NW arrays have been attracting excessive attention in comparison with pristine ZnO NWs and ZnO/ZnS core–shell heterostructure NWs for enhancing the performance of PEC water-splitting devices.32,41 Large surface areas that are beneficial for efficient light absorption, rapid carrier transport, and facile integration of two or more materials offered by the 3D h-ZnO NWs lead to a higher conversion efficiency of solar water splitting.42–44 In addition, branched NWs typically have shorter lengths compared to the main trunk (MTr) NW that can enhance charge separation and collection owing to the close proximity between the photogenerated carriers and the semiconductor–electrolyte interface.41,45,46 Moreover, 3D h-NW arrays can enhance photoabsorption by trapping and re-scattering of incident photons.47,48
Herein, we present a systematic and facile single-step growth process of 3D hierarchical ZnO/ZnS heterojunction branched nanowires (ZnO/ZnS h-b-NWs) on boron-doped (100) Si using metal–organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). In this process, we investigate the essential role of ZnS in the growth of h-ZnO NWs as it is inserted between the main trunk and the branched NWs. The surface morphology, crystal structure, elemental analysis, surface chemical composition, and optical properties of the as-prepared 3D ZnO/ZnS h-b-NWs have been well characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) analysis. Then, the as-grown 3D ZnO/ZnS h-b-NWs were applied as photoanodes for PEC water splitting. The PEC performance of 3D ZnO/ZnS h-b-NWs was better than that of pristine ZnO NWs. By inserting ZnS, we achieved a type-II band alignment between the MTr-ZnO NWs and ZnS. The type-II transition plays a crucial role in the reduction of the recombination losses. In addition, type-II band alignment can easily facilitate the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, which is advantageous for the PEC water-splitting process.
2. Experimental procedure
2.1. Photoanode synthesis
For the growth of 3D ZnO/ZnS h-b-NWs, a boron-doped (100) Si substrate with a resistivity of <0.001 Ω was treated with buffered oxide etch for 15 s, then deionized (DI) water, and then N2 for drying, to remove the native oxide from the Si substrate. Thereafter, the substrate was transferred to an ultrasonic bath for organic cleaning using acetone and methanol for 10 min each, then rinsed with DI water, and finally dried under N2 flow. After the cleaning procedure, the substrate was precoated with a thin ZnO buffer layer to reduce the lattice mismatch with the substrate via an atomic layer deposition (Lucida D100, NCD Technology) machine. The buffer layer with 20 nm-thick ZnO was deposited with Zn(C2H5)2 [diethyl zinc (DEZn)] and H2O as the precursors on the Si substrate at 150 °C. The ZnO deposition cycle was DEZn pulse/N2 purge/H2O pulse/N2 purge (0.2 s/10 s/0.2 s/20 s) and the deposition rate was measured to be 1.4 Å per cycle.8,16,49 After the ZnO buffer layer deposition, the growth substrate was transferred immediately to the MOCVD reactor for the growth of 3D ZnO/ZnS h-b-NWs. The first step to achieve our hierarchical structure starts from the growth of vertically well-aligned MTr-ZnO NWs using DEZn as the zinc precursor and high-purity (5 N) N2O as the oxidizer. During the growth of MTr-ZnO NWs, the flow rates of DEZn and N2O were 40 and 80 sccm, respectively. These precursors were introduced into the MOCVD chamber using high-purity (5 N) N2 as a carrier gas with a flow rate of 3 slm. To prevent the pre-reaction between the precursors, which could degrade the crystal quality of the structure, DEZn and N2O were introduced separately into the reactor through two nozzles. The growth time was maintained for 7200 s whereas the growth temperature was kept at 750 °C. Subsequently, the ZnS thin film was introduced immediately into the reactor as a shell on the MTr-ZnO NWs, forming ZnO/ZnS NWs for 1800 s using DEZn and H2S as zinc and sulfur precursors, respectively. The flow rates of DEZn and H2S were fixed at 20 and 38 sccm, respectively. Then, H2S was switched to N2O for the growth of hierarchically branched ZnO nanowires (h-b-ZnO NWs) with the same flow rates as those of MTr-ZnO NWs, but with a lower growth time of 3600 s. Thereafter, for the fabrication of s-h-b-ZnO NWs under the same growth conditions as for the first growth of ZnS, except that the growth time was reduced to 900 s, N2O was switched to H2S for ZnS growth on the first branch of ZnO NWs (referred to as s-h-b-ZnO NWs). Then MOCVD was naturally cooled down to room temperature. During the MOCVD process, the growth pressure was maintained at 100 torr.
2.2. Photoanode characterization
The surface morphology of the as-grown 3D ZnO/ZnS h-b-NWs after each step was monitored using a FE-SEM (JSM-6700 F, JEOL Japan). To investigate the cross-sectional structure of the processed ZnO/ZnS NWs, HAADF STEM (JEM-2100F, JEOL) was performed. A focused ion beam (FIB) (Quanta 3D FEG, FEI) was used for performing STEM. Prior to the STEM characterization, the as-grown ZnO/ZnS NWs were scraped using a sharp blade from the Si substrate and ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol. Subsequently, a few drops from the solution were dispersed onto a cleaned Si substrate and dried at 50 °C on a hot plate. Then a very thin slab was taken from the NW cross-section using the FIB and bonded to the TEM grade. The crystal structure of the as-grown NWs was analyzed through XRD. The XRD measurements were carried out via a Philips X’PERT-PRO PANalytical over the 2θ angular range of 20–70° under grazing incidence using Cu Kα irradiation (wavelength λ = 1.5406 Å) with a step of 0.0260 at a scanning speed of 0.02° s−1. Room temperature PL was performed for the 3D ZnO/ZnS h-b-NWs using a diode-pumped solid-state (DPSS) laser (Ekspla) with an excitation wavelength of 266 nm and a spectrometer (f = 0.5 m, Acton Research Co. Spectrograph 500i) and an intensified CCD (P1-Max3) (Princeton Instruments). The applied laser power on the sample surface was 30 mW with a spectral resolution of approximately 0.34 nm. To assess the surface chemical composition and states of the 3D ZnO/ZnS h-b-NWs, XPS was employed. The XPS measurements were performed in an ultrahigh vacuum compatible chamber using a high-performance XPS (HP-XPS, K-ALPHA+, Thermo Scientific) equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα source.
2.3. Photoelectrochemical water-splitting measurements
To evaluate the PEC water-splitting performance of the designed 3D ZnO/ZnS h-b-NWs, a three-electrode home-made PEC cell was used. The PEC cell was directly connected to a Potentiostat/Galvanostat (Parstat 3000A, Princeton Applied Research) with the ability to apply variable potentials. The as-designed 3D ZnO/ZnS h-b-NWs, a Pt wire, and a Ag/AgCl were connected as the working photoanode, counter-electrode, and reference electrode, respectively. To facilitate the electron transport, a conductive copper wire was connected to the front side of the hierarchical NWs via indium soldering. The as-designed 3D ZnO/ZnS h-b-NWs were irradiated from the front face using a 300 W Xe lamp (Newport 66902) with a light irradiance of approximately 100 mW cm−2 through a transparent quartz window. The photoanodes were kept in direct contact with the electrolyte with an exposed surface area of approximately 0.52 cm2. The electrolyte used during the PEC measurements was 0.5 M Na2SO4. The PEC cell was fabricated from Teflon, which is inert to strong acids and bases.
3. Results and discussion
The fabrication process of the 3D ZnO/ZnS h-b-NW photoanode is schematically presented in Fig. 1. The detailed process is explained in the Experimental section. Fig. 2 shows a typical series of SEM images depicting the surface morphological features of the fabrication process of the as-grown 3D ZnO/ZnS h-b-NW photoanode after each procedure during the growth. Fig. 2(A1) and (A2) display the cross-sectional and tilted-view SEM images of the MTr-ZnO NWs grown on a Si substrate; they were vertically well aligned with high density, and they were uniformly distributed across the entire substrate. The average length of the MTr-ZnO NWs was estimated to be 3.5 μm, whereas the top-view image in Fig. 2A3 with higher magnification indicates that the NWs have an approximate diameter of 42 nm with a well-defined hexagonal shape. After the growth of MTr-ZnO NWs, N2O gas was immediately switched to the H2S line for the ZnS shell deposition on MTr-ZnO NWs. Fig. 2(B1) and (B2) show that the surface morphology of the ZnO/ZnS NWs became rougher than that of MTr-ZnO NWs. Furthermore, their thickness increased after ZnS deposition. In addition, the tips of the NWs were slightly tapered due to the strain induced by the lattice mismatch between ZnO and ZnS, which can be noticed in Fig. 2(B3).50,51 Next, the H2S precursor was switched to N2O for the growth of h-b-ZnO NWs immediately after ZnS deposition. Fig. 2(C1) and (C2) depict the cross-sectional and top-view SEM images of h-b-ZnO NWs, respectively, which show a uniform growth in the length and diameter of the h-b-ZnO NWs. The average length and diameter of the h-b-ZnO NWs are approximately 500 nm and 50 nm, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2(C3). Finally, the h-b-ZnO NWs were covered by the ZnS shell layer (referred to as s-h-b-ZnO NWs) by switching the N2O gas to H2S after their growth, which can be seen in Fig. 2(D1) and (D2). The high-magnification top-view SEM image displayed in Fig. 2(D3) shows that there is a considerable surface roughness with an increase in the diameter, thereby indicating that ZnS was successfully coated on the surface of the h-b-ZnO NWs. It is noteworthy that no morphological deformation was observed on the surface of the h-b-ZnO NWs after ZnS decoration.

Further characterization was performed using HR-TEM and high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (HAADF STEM-EDS) to elucidate the microstructure and crystal quality of the as-grown 3D ZnO/ZnS h-b-NWs. Fig. 3(a) represents a low-resolution TEM image of a single MTr-ZnO NW possessing a uniform diameter of approximately 40 nm with a smooth surface along the growth directions. Fig. 3(b) displays a HR-TEM image of the red circle area in Fig. 3(a) with clear and well-resolved lattice fringes. The interplanar spacing distance d was measured to be 0.262 nm, which corresponds to the (0002) planes of hexagonal ZnO.52–54 In addition, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (inset of Fig. 3(b)) exhibits strong diffraction spots from single-crystalline ZnO NWs; this confirms the hexagonal phase wurtzite (WZ) structure, and the NWs are preferentially oriented along the c-axis. Furthermore, EDS elemental mapping was carried out to determine the composition. Fig. 3(c) displays a bright-field TEM image of the as-grown ZnO NW and the elemental maps of Zn Kα1 (turquoise) and O Kα1 (red).

To further assess the cross-sectional structure of the as-grown ZnO/ZnS NWs, a very thin slab was fabricated using a focused ion beam (FIB) taken from a single NW as displayed in Fig. 3(d). It can be observed that the ZnS shell entirely covers the ZnO NW with a uniform thickness of approximately 25 nm. It is noteworthy that some voids can be clearly observed at the ZnO/ZnS interface mainly near the corners of ZnO. The phenomenon of the void formation is analogously related to the Kirkendall effect, which is known to generate pores in the structure based on the difference in diffusion rates of the metal atoms in a diffusion couple at the interface.55,56 Alivisatos et al. explained this effect based on the diffusion speed, which is influenced by the size of the ions. As oxygen ions (O2−) are smaller than sulfur ions (S2−), they diffuse easily and at a faster speed than that of the incoming S2−, thereby leaving a porous structure behind.57 In our structure, the coating of the ZnS shell layer on the ZnO core surface can promote a highly strained interface between the ZnO core and the ZnS shell because of the large lattice mismatch. Based on the Kirkendall effect, atoms at the corners of ZnO would migrate into the ZnS shell near the interface through the anion exchange reaction to relax the strain energy. Fig. 3(e) exhibits the enlarged HR-TEM image of the interface region of ZnO/ZnS NWs taken from the red circle area in Fig. 3(d). The measured d-spacing of 0.28 nm in the core area exactly matches with the (010) plane of WZ ZnO, whereas the d-spacing of 0.19 nm located in the shell region corresponds to the (20) lattice fringes of zinc blende (ZB) ZnS. In addition, the SAED patterns clearly authenticate the existence of the hexagonal phase of ZnO in the core region (bottom-left inset of Fig. 3(e)) and the cubic phase of ZB ZnS in the shell region (top-right inset of Fig. 3(e)) with high crystal quality. STEM elemental mapping was carried out for further confirmation of the composition of ZnO/ZnS NWs. As exhibited in Fig. 3(f), it is clear that S exists with high concentration only at the edge of the structure, whereas O is more concentrated in the core region.

Fig. 3(g) displays the low-magnification HR-TEM image of a single 3D ZnO/ZnS h-b-NW implying the successful growth of the h-b-ZnO NWs. It seems that most of the h-b-ZnO NWs are entirely covered with the ZnO/ZnS NWs with vertical alignment. From the high-magnification TEM image (Fig. S1a†), the diameter and length of h-b-ZnO NWs were found to be 40 and 500 nm, respectively. In addition, the HR-TEM image (Fig. S1b†) taken at the interface marked with the red circle area (Fig. S1a†) exhibited d-spacings of 0.26 nm for the (0002) plane of h-b-ZnO NWs and 0.31 nm for the (111) plane of ZnS, suggesting that both MTr-ZnO and h-b-ZnO NWs have the same growth orientation along the c-axis with a hexagonal phase WZ structure. Moreover, the TEM-EDS map clearly indicates that the O, S, and Zn atoms were distributed throughout the 3D ZnO/ZnS h-b-NW structure as O Kα1 (yellow), S Kα1 (red), and Zn Kα1 (turquoise), respectively, as depicted in Fig. 3(h). Furthermore, TEM-EDS mapping was performed for a single h-b-ZnO NW (Fig. S1c–f†) to clarify the uniform distribution of Zn and O elements only inside the h-b-ZnO NWs. The line scan profile of the EDS spectra (Fig. S2a†) collected along the lateral direction of the 3D h-ZnO NWs STEM image (inset of Fig. S2a†) exhibits the elemental distribution throughout the structure, further confirming the successful growth of the 3D ZnO/ZnS h-b-NWs. The corresponding EDS spectrum of the 3D ZnO/ZnS h-b-NWs (Fig. S2b†) displayed the presence of O, S, and Zn peaks, which demonstrate the phase purity of our structure. Furthermore, the table (inset of Fig. S2b†) provides the percentage data of the elements inside the sample.
In fact, the growth mechanism of the branched NW formation after ZnS insertion can be explained by the crystal growth mechanism. ZnO is known to be grown with a nanowire morphology due to the preferential growth rate along the c-axis.58 The planes normal to the c-plane have a very low sticking coefficient of surface adatoms, so the lateral growth on nanowire sidewalls is prohibited under the conventional growth conditions of ZnO. However, the ZnS shell layer seems to modify the surface properties such as the dangling bond configuration, surface energy, and surface roughness, and facilitates the formation of nucleation sites for ZnO branched nanowires. This behavior is consistent with the reports that ZnS is usually grown with a thin film morphology under conventional MOCVD growth conditions.
XRD measurements were carried out to identify the crystalline phase of the as-grown NWs during the synthesis of 3D ZnO/ZnS h-b-NW photoanodes. As presented in Fig. 4(a), the XRD pattern of MTr-ZnO NWs exhibited a clear diffraction peak at 2θ = 34.44°, which can be indexed to the (0002) plane of hexagonal WZ ZnO with the lattice constants a = 3.25 Å and c = 5.21 Å (space group: P63/mc, PDF 98-005-7450 card). It can be observed clearly that the (0002) plane has a stronger intensity than the other peaks appearing in the same pattern, indicating that the preferential growth orientation of the NWs is along the c-axis. After the growth of the ZnS shell on MTr-ZnO NWs to form ZnO/ZnS NWs, an evident strong diffraction peak was detected at 2θ = 28.58°, which can be indexed to the (111) plane of the cubic phase ZnS (PDF 98-010-7198 card).59 However, the (0002) ZnO diffraction peak is almost faded, which can be attributed probably to the thicker ZnS shell. Because the thick ZnS shell covers the MTr-ZnO NWs entirely, their peaks appear stronger and can be easily detected as compared to the ZnO NW peaks. As the h-b-ZnO NWs were grown, the (0002) ZnO diffraction peak started to appear with the same intensity as observed previously in the XRD pattern of the MTr-ZnO NWs. Furthermore, the (111) ZnS diffraction peak was observed in the pattern obtained for the exposed ZnS layer in which the h-b-ZnO NWs did not grow completely. Subsequently, the h-b-ZnO NWs were coated with the ZnS shell to obtain the s-h-b-ZnO NWs, and their XRD pattern exhibited the same trend as the ZnO/ZnS NWs, which has been explained early in this section. However, the intensity of the (111) ZnS diffraction peak decreased as compared to the ZnO/ZnS NWs, which could be attributed to the thinner shell of ZnS because its growth time decreased during this procedure.
 Fig. 4  (a) XRD patterns and (b) PL spectra of the as-grown MTr-ZnO, ZnO/ZnS, h-b-ZnO, and s-h-b-ZnO NWs, respectively. 
To assess the optical properties of the 3D ZnO/ZnS h-b-NW photoanode, room-temperature PL spectroscopy was performed for the MTr-ZnO, ZnO/ZnS, h-b-ZnO, and s-h-b-ZnO NWs; the corresponding spectra are displayed in Fig. 4(b). The PL spectrum of the MTr-ZnO NW sample exhibited only a very sharp ultraviolet (UV) emission peak located at 379 nm (∼3.28 eV) without deep-level emission. It is very well known that the UV emission peak corresponds to the near-band-edge (NBE) emission of wide-bandgap ZnO, which stems from the free exciton recombination owing to the large exciton binding energy of ZnO.60 For the ZnO/ZnS NW sample, two UV emission peaks centered at 337 nm (∼3.68 eV) and 380 nm (∼3.28 eV), which are related to the NBE emissions of ZnS and ZnO, respectively, are clearly observed in the PL spectrum.16,61 In addition, there is a visible green emission peak approximately at 522 nm (∼2.37 eV), which is attributed to the type-II transition at the interface, not to the defects of ZnO or even ZnS.48 Owing to the type-II band alignment formed in ZnO/ZnS NWs, the separated electrons and holes can recombine to emit the observed visible light shown in the PL spectrum. It is noteworthy that the visible emission peak is dominant for all samples except the MTr-ZnO NW sample. However, the NBE emission peaks with lower intensities were observed in the PL spectra of the h-b-ZnO and s-h-b-ZnO NWs, probably because of the separation of the photogenerated charge carriers.62
To reveal the surface chemical composition and electronic states of the as-synthesized photoanode, XPS was carried out for the 3D ZnO/ZnS h-b-NW sample. The XPS survey spectrum displayed in Fig. 5(a) indicates the presence of S, O, and Zn in the h-b-ZnO NW photoanode. Fig. 5(b) shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of Zn with binding energy peaks appearing at 1021.41 and 1044.51 eV corresponding to the Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 states, respectively. The separation between the doublets of Zn states was calculated to be 23.1 eV, which indicates the presence of the Zn2+ valence state.54 Moreover, the XPS spectrum of O 1s exhibited three peaks located at 530.27, 531.68, and 532.79 eV, which could be assigned to the Zn–O bonds, oxygen vacancies, and chemisorbed oxygen of surface hydroxyl species, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5(c).50 Meanwhile, the fitted XPS spectra of S 2p can be deconvoluted into four peaks at 161.68, 162.88, 168.46, and 169.55 eV, as depicted in Fig. 5(d). The lower binding energy peaks at 161.68 and 162.88 eV with a spin-energy separation of 1.2 eV and an intensity ratio of 2:1 are assigned to the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 states, respectively, which are related to the S2− ions.63 On the other hand, the higher binding energy peaks located at 168.46 and 169.55 eV could be attributed to the sulfate species formed by sulfur oxidation in air.64

To investigate the PEC water-splitting performance of the photoanodes, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed for the as-synthesized MTr-ZnO, ZnO/ZnS, h-b-ZnO, and s-h-b-ZnO NWs in a three-electrode PEC cell with a Pt wire and Ag/AgCl as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The LSV was carried out under dark and illuminated conditions in 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte (with pH ∼ 5.88). The applied potential was converted from the Ag/AgCl electrode to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to the Nernst equation:65  where E(Ag/AgCl) is the potential applied versus the Ag/AgCl reference electrode,  is the standard potential of the Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and is equal to 0.1976 V vs. RHE at 25 °C, and ERHE is the converted potential relative to the RHE. All photoanodes exhibited negligible dark currents in the nano-ampere range (Fig. S3†). From the LSV measurements within the applied potential range of −0.4 to 2.0 V vs. RHE displayed in Fig. 6(a), the MTr-ZnO NW photoanode exhibited photocurrent densities of 0.013 and 0.278 mA cm−2 at potentials of 0 and 2.0 V vs. RHE, respectively, whereas those values of the h-b-ZnO NW photoanode strikingly increase up to 0.0382 and 1.3 mA cm−2, respectively. Compared to the MTr-ZnO NWs, the h-b-ZnO NWs exhibited a surprising three-fold enhancement at a potential of 0 V vs. RHE and a five-fold enhancement at a potential of 2.0 V vs. RHE. The observed enhancement can be explained by the increased photoabsorption, which is directly associated with the augmented surface area.48 By growing ZnO NWs with good crystallinity and high density, the diffusion length of the electron and the electron collection can be increased owing to the NW morphology, which provides direct paths for the electron transport.66 In addition, the randomly oriented h-b-NWs strongly enhance the light harvesting without any impact on electron transport. After the synthesis of ZnS, the photocurrent density increases remarkably and reaches up to 0.7 and 2.2 mA cm−2 at 2.0 V vs. RHE for ZnO/ZnS and s-h-b-ZnO NWs, respectively, which could be attributed to the type-II band alignment between ZnO and ZnS. As the type-II band alignment is formed, the type-II transition that occurs at the interface between ZnO and ZnS becomes more dominant and can be considered as an effective parameter to reduce the carrier recombination losses and enable a fast separation for the photogenerated carriers.48 Moreover, the type-II band alignment enables visible light absorption at the ZnO/ZnS interface, although the photon energy is smaller than the ZnO and ZnS energy gaps, which is beneficial for the PEC process.67 To ensure that the s-h-b-ZnO NW photoanode was chemically stable and the cubic phase of ZnS did not change after the PEC water-splitting reaction, SEM and XRD analyses were carried out (Fig. S4 and S5†). It is noteworthy that the thickness of ZnS should be carefully optimized to achieve the excellent PEC-WS performance. As we previously reported, there is a trade-off between efficiency and thickness when a ZnO/ZnS core–shell photoanode is used.8,61 Briefly, if the ZnS film is too thick, the charge separation efficiency degrades as hole transport in ZnS is retarded by its higher resistivity, while very thin ZnS does not provide sufficient protection to the electrode during the PEC process. In this regard, the ZnS thickness was adjusted to around 25 nm in this work based on the optimized conditions in our previous publications.

Furthermore, the applied-bias-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (ABPE) was calculated to assess the PEC performance and estimate the efficiency of the as-grown photoanodes, as illustrated in Fig. 6(b). The ABPE is calculated based on the LSV measurements according to the formula ABPE (%) = 100 × J (mA cm−2) (1.23 − Vapp)/Plight (mA cm−2), where J is the measured photocurrent density in mA cm−2, 1.23 V is the standard-state reversible potential of the water, Vapp is the applied potential vs. RHE, and Plight is the power density of light illumination in mA cm−2.16 As shown in Fig. 6(b), the MTr-ZnO NW photoanode exhibited a photoconversion efficiency of 0.03% at approximately 0.5 V vs. RHE, whereas the h-b-ZnO NWs exhibited an ABPE of 0.27% at approximately 0.7 V vs. RHE, which corresponds to a nine-fold enhancement. After the deposition of ZnS, the efficiency reached 0.46% at 0.5 V vs. RHE, i.e., almost 16-fold enhancement compared to MTr-ZnO NWs.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to clarify the interfacial charge transport behavior within the frequency range (1 Hz to 100 kHz) under dark conditions. Fig. 7 represents the Nyquist plots constructed from the electrochemical impedance spectra measured for the MTr-ZnO, ZnO/ZnS, h-b-ZnO, and s-h-b-ZnO NW photoanodes. It is noteworthy that the Nyquist plots of all the photoanodes exhibited a semicircular shape, which represents the charge transfer at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. The diameter of the semicircle can be attributed to the charge transfer resistance.52,68 As can be clearly observed in Fig. 7, the h-b-ZnO NW photoanode exhibited a semicircle with a smaller diameter than those of the MTr-ZnO NW photoanodes; it became further smaller after ZnS deposition for the s-h-b-ZnO NW photoanode. The smaller arc radius of the s-h-b-ZnO NW photoanode (inset of Fig. 7) evidently indicates that the interfacial charge transfer resistance has been significantly reduced, which led to faster charge transport with high efficiency and suppression of the recombination of the electron–hole pairs.

To further quantify the photoresponse and gain more insights into the number of absorbed photons converted into photogenerated charge carriers, the incident-photon-to-current-conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed as a function of monochromatic light irradiation. The IPCE was calculated for the as-synthesized MTr-ZnO, ZnO/ZnS, h-b-ZnO, and s-h-b-ZnO NWs using the following equation: IPCE (%) = 100 × 1240 (V nm) × J (mA cm−2)/λ (nm) × Plight, where the factor 1240 represents the product of the speed of light and Planck's constant, λ is the wavelength of the illuminating monochromatic light, and Plight is the optical power density at a given wavelength. As shown in Fig. 8, all photoanodes exhibited a photoresponse in the UV light region, and the highest IPCE of 26.4% was recorded for the s-h-b-ZnO NW photoanode, which is higher than those of the h-b-ZnO (20.5%), ZnO/ZnS (14.7%), and MTr ZnO (2.1%). Due to the enhanced scattering of light and enlarged surface area, the ZnO/ZnS, h-b-ZnO, and s-h-b-ZnO NW photoanodes exhibit higher photoactivity even in the UV region. More significant contribution by the introduction of ZnS layers was noted in the visible region, from 400 to 650 nm. For MTr ZnO NWs, almost no photoresponse was observed over 400 nm. However, the IPCEs of ZnO/ZnS, h-b-ZnO, and s-h-b-ZnO increased greatly with the enhancement of the light absorption due to the type-II transition at the ZnO/ZnS interface. The average IPCE between 400 and 650 nm was ZnO/ZnS (4.16%), h-b-ZnO (6.84%), and s-h-b-ZnO (8.2%). Therefore, the high PEC water splitting efficiency of the hierarchical ZnO/ZnS branched NW photoanode is attributed to visible light absorption in the ZnO/ZnS heterostructure and increased absorption by enhanced scattering of incident light.

4. Conclusion
We successfully investigated a single-step growth mechanism of 3D ZnO/ZnS h-b-NWs on a Si substrate using the MOCVD growth technique. Modifying the MTr-ZnO NWs with ZnS is vital in this mechanism for the growth of the h-b-ZnO NWs. The as-prepared structures, after each procedure, were characterized by FE-SEM, HAADF-STEM, XPS, and PL analyses for assessing the crystal quality and structure. Next, the samples were applied as photoanodes for PEC water splitting. The MTr-ZnO NWs exhibited a photocurrent density of approximately 0.278 mA cm−2 with a photoconversion efficiency of 0.03%, whereas the h-b-ZnO NWs modified with ZnS exhibited a significant enhancement in photocurrent density (2.2 mA cm−2) and photoconversion efficiency (0.46%). The improvement achieved is strongly attributed to the enhanced photoabsorption, which is associated with the enlarged surface area of h-b-NWs. In addition, the type-II transition at the ZnO/ZnS interface facilitates the fast and highly efficient separation of the electron–hole pairs. We believe that our technique can be meaningful for the scalable fabrication of multiple branched NWs, which are beneficial for several applications such as optoelectronic and solar energy conversion devices.
