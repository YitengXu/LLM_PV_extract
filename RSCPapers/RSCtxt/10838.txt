    , Accepted 30th November 2017First published on 1st December 2017AbstractIn this study, we constructed an in situ Fenton-like photocatalytic system driven by visible-light irradiation. First, BiOBr, a benign in situ H2O2 producer, was prepared via a simple hydrothermal method. Then, the accelerant (CoFe2O4 nanoparticles as the precursor) for H2O2 decomposition was loaded onto the surface of the BiOBr photocatalyst to build a well-contacted interface for reactive sites. CoxFeyO4 nanoparticles etched to different extents were obtained by adjusting the solution pH (pH = 1, 3 and 7) during the composite preparation process. A group of green and efficient CoxFeyO4–BiOBr photocatalysts (abbreviated as CFB) (pH = 1, 3 and 7) were successfully synthesized. The optimal CFB material used for BPA photodegradation was 0.5% CFB (pH = 3). The reaction rate constant of 0.5% CFB (pH = 3) was 3.4 times higher than BiOBr (pH = 3). H2O2 detection, ESR and radical trapping experiments demonstrated that much of the H2O2 produced by BiOBr (pH = 3) was successfully decomposed to ˙O2− and ˙OH, which played important roles with h+ in the BPA photodegradation process, thereby a possible photocatalytic mechanism was proposed. Cycling experiments indicated the good stability of 0.5% CFB (pH = 3). This work may offer a green and efficient method for in situ H2O2 generation and decomposition, thus, the secondary pollution and harsh conditions of the conventional Fenton reaction can be tactfully avoided.
1. Introduction
Advanced oxidation processes (AOP) are one of the most common chemical strategies used for environmental remediation.1 The advantages of this kind of technology are low cost and high efficiency. AOPs are based on the generation of ROS, such as hydroxyl radicals (˙OH), superoxide radicals (˙O2−) and sulfate radicals (˙SO4−), which are capable of oxidizing or mineralizing refractory organic matter found in the environment. Moreover, AOPs are clean and can effectively oxidize, in a non-selective manner, various organic and inorganic compounds. Among the previously reported AOPs, the Fenton reaction has been considered as the most suitable candidate for environmental remediation due to its simplicity. However, in almost all cases, the classic Fenton reaction needs an acidic aqueous-phase medium (pH = 2.5–5.0) to realize efficient reactivity,2–4 because Fe3+ is easily converted into its complex forms under strongly acidic or alkaline conditions, which reduces the reactions performance:5 Strongly acidic condition: Fe3+ + 6H2O ↔ Fe(H2O)63+(1) Alkaline conditions: Fe3+ ↔ FeOH2+ ↔ Fe(OH)2+ ↔ Fe2(OH)24+ ↔ Other polynuclear species ↔ Fe2O3·nH2O(s)(2)
Recent work has mainly focused on realizing the Fenton reaction under natural conditions. One of the most promising and efficient cases is the photo-Fenton degradation process. In the H2O2 assisted photo-Fenton degradation process, H2O2 is consumed via three pathways: i) activation to produce highly reactive ˙OH radicals by accepting an electron from the conduction band (CB) of a semiconductor (eqn (4)), ii) decomposition into ˙O2− (eqn (5) and (6)) and iii) self-decomposition into water and oxygen (eqn (7)).6–8 More importantly, not only does the existence of H2O2 offer more reactive radicals it also consumes the photo-excited electrons (e−) and leaves sufficient holes (h+) on the valence band (VB) for the oxidation of organic pollutants. As a result, the photocatalytic activity can be improved.9 Indeed, many reports have successfully demonstrated the natural heterogeneous photo-Fenton reaction using ammonia-modified graphene/Fe3O4,10 FePc,11 ZnFe2O4,12 FeIIILysSiW,13 g-C3N4/NH2-Fe (ref. 14) and so on. However, the addition of H2O2, the tight range of pH and further treatment of iron sludge increase the overall cost of the water treatment process.15,16 O2 + 2H+ + 2e−CB → H2O2(3) Fe2+ + H2O2 + e− → Fe3+ + ˙HO + OH−,  K ≈ 70 M−1 s−1(4) Fe3+ + H2O2 → Fe2+ + H+ + ˙OOH,  K = 0.001–0.01 M−1 s−1(5) ˙OOH → H+ + ˙O2−(6) 2H2O2 → H2O + O2(7)
Recently, it has been reported that some photocatalysts have been shown to produce H2O2via a two-electron reduction of oxygen under visible-light irradiation (eqn (3)),17,18 which can supply the prerequisite of the Fenton reaction. Among the various photocatalysts materials, BiOX (X = Cl, Br and I) semi-conductive photocatalysts have attracted a growing amount of attention.19–23 Their favorable photocatalytic performance makes it possible for BiOX to be applied in solar energy conversion and environmental remediation under visible-light or UV light irradiation. The unique layered structures formed by interlacing [Bi2O2] slabs and double halogen slabs endow BiOX materials with the effective separation of the photoinduced electron–hole pairs.24 In particular, BiOBr has a fairly good response to visible-light because it possesses a narrower band gap of about 2.92 eV, but the photoinduced e−–h+ pairs are easily recombined so that no active species are generated in the photocatalytic process. Recent work on BiOBr modification have been shown to vastly promote the photocatalytic performance, such as ion doping and semiconductor coupling.25–30 Related work on BiOBr has also been reported to prove its ability to produce H2O2.31,32 These findings provide a facile and promising solution to construct an in situ Fenton reaction without the use of H2O2 as a reagent. For example, pioneering work has been achieved by Ye's group,33 whom constructed a solid–gas-interfacial Fenton reaction over an alkalinized-C3N4 photocatalyst using surface-decorated Fe3+ as the trigger for H2O2 conversion, which attains highly efficient and universal activity for the photodegradation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). However, this simple Fe3+ modification over a photocatalyst could not be adapted to aqueous solution photocatalytic reactions due to the loss of Fe3+. Therefore, a solid-state in situ Fenton reaction is the key towards the effective degradation of organic pollutants.
In the heterogeneous Fenton-like process, iron compounds, such as FeS,34 α-Fe2O3,35 Fe3O4 (ref. 36) and FeOOH,37 and kinds of spinel-type magnetite MxFeyO4 (M = Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) have been most frequently described as trigger catalysts for H2O2 conversion, especially the spinel-type magnetite CoxFeyO4, which seems to exhibit a higher degree of Fenton-like activity.38–40 CoxFeyO4 possesses specific features for catalyzing ROSs production.7,41–44
Accordingly, the superiorities of BiOBr and CoxFeyO4 motivated us to fabricate CFB photocatalysts with the hope of improving the in situ heterogeneous Fenton-like process in aqueous solution for the degradation of organic pollutants.
In this work, we constructed an in situ solid–aqueous-interfacial Fenton-like reaction using a simple acid etching CoFe2O4 method in the synthesis process of the CFB hybrid materials, in which the molar ratio of Co/Fe can be simply tuned by adjusting the pH. The optimal photocatalyst 0.5% CFB (pH = 3), can produce a considerable amount of oxygen-derived radicals to participate in the photocatalytic degradation reaction. Unexpectedly, differing from the classical Fenton reaction or photo-Fenton reaction, this CFB hybrid system uses light energy as power, the BiOBr photocatalyst as an in situ and robust H2O2 generator, and the surface-decorated CoxFeyO4 as a trigger for H2O2 conversion, which attains highly efficient activity for the photodegradation of phenol compounds such as bisphenol A (BPA) (eqn (8)–(11) and (6)). Herein, the proposed strategy coupled with a solid–aqueous-interfacial Fenton-like reaction may open up a new route for the efficient production of active radicals as a photocatalyst surface for water treatment. Fe2+ + H2O2 + e− → Fe3+ + ˙OH + OH−(8) Fe3+ + H2O2 → Fe2+ + H+ + ˙OOH(9) Co2+ + H2O2 + e− → Co3+ + ˙OH + OH−(10) Co3+ + H2O2 → Co2+ + H+ + ˙OOH(11) ˙OOH → H+ + ˙O2−(6)
2. Experimental section
2.1. Synthesis of the materials
All the reagents were purchased from Shanghai Chengjie Chemical Co. Ltd. and used without further purification.

2.1.1. Synthesis of CoFe2O4. 
A sol–gel method was applied in the CoFe2O4 preparation process. Typically, 4.0402 g of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and 1.4553 g of Co(NO3)2·6H2O were dissolved into 100 mL of deionized water, and the resulting homogeneous liquid was named as solution A. Then, 3.1521 g of citric acid was dissolved into 100 mL of deionized water, followed by the dropwise addition of solution A under vigorous magnetic stirring. Subsequently the reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h at room temperature and then evaporated in an oil bath at 60 °C. The residue was dried at 90 °C and placed into an alumina crucible and calcined in a tube furnace for 3 h at 300 °C.


2.1.2. Synthesis of the CFB photocatalysts. 
In a typical method, 0.486 g of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O was dissolved in deionized water, then a certain amount of CoFe2O4 was added to the solution. After stirring for 30 min, a stoichiometric amount of NaBr was added to the resulting suspension and stirred for 10 min, followed by adjusting the reaction mixture to pH = 1, 3 and 7 (using 1 M NaOH), respectively. The resulting turbid liquid was transferred into a 25 mL Teflon-lined autoclave with 80% of the total volume filled and subsequently heated at 160 °C for 18 h. The precipitates were collected and then washed several times to pH neutral using deionized water and anhydrous ethanol, respectively. Finally, the solids were dried at 60 °C for several hours. According to the different mass ratio of CoFe2O4 to BiOBr and different liquid pH, the as-prepared photocatalysts under different pH were preliminarily denoted as c% CFB (pH = 1, 3 or 7) photocatalysts, where c is mass ratio of CoFe2O4 to Bi(NO3)3·5H2O. The corresponding pristine BiOBr samples were prepared at the different pH values without adding the CoFe2O4 nanoparticles and named as BiOBr (pH = 1, 3 or 7).

2.2. Characterization
The crystallinity of the as-synthesized materials was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Bruker D8 diffractometer equipped with a Cu-Kα (λ = 1.51418 Å) radiation source. The morphology of the materials was captured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on an JEOL JSM-7001F apparatus. The Co and Fe element contents of the samples were determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) (Varian, America). High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using two Varian ProStar210 pumps, an Agilent TC-C (18) column and a Varian ProStar325 UV-vis detector at 230 nm was applied for the photodegradation product analysis. The mobile phase was a solution of methanol and H2O (in a volume ratio of 75:25) at a rate of 1 mL min−1. 20 μL of the sample solution was collected and analyzed. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra were collected on a UV-3600Plus UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Corporation, Japan) with BaSO4 used as the reference and the photocurrent measurements were conducted on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660B, Chenhua Instrument Company, Shanghai, China). The electron spin resonance (ESR) signals of the spin-trapped radicals were conducted on a Bruker model ESR JES-FA200 spectrometer employing the spin-trapping reagent DMPO (Sigma Chemical Co.) in water and methanol, respectively. The photoluminescence (PL) intensity of the samples was obtained using a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrometer.
2.3. Photoactivity measurements
To estimate the photoactivity of the as-prepared photocatalysts, bisphenol A (BPA) was used as the target water pollutant. 100 mL of an aqueous solution of BPA (10 mg L−1) was degraded using 50 mg the as-prepared samples, respectively. Before xenon light irradiation, the mixture was stirred in the dark for 30 min to achieve an adsorption–desorption equilibrium. The photocatalytic experiments were conducted at 30 °C using a circulating water system to remove any thermal catalytic effects. About 4 mL of the resulting suspension was collected at interval of 20 min for analysis. The samples were centrifuged and filtered using polyether sulfone membranes (φ 0.22 μm) to remove the photocatalysts. The remaining liquids were analyzed using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-2450).
2.4. Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical performance was measured on a CHI 660B electrochemical system (Chenhua Instrument Company) using a standard three-electrode cell equipped with a working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode. The working electrodes were prepared via a dip-coating method: 5 mg of sample was suspended in 0.5 mL of ethanol and 0.5 mL of EG to produce a slurry. Subsequently, 20 μL of the sample slurry was then dip-coated onto a piece of ITO slice with a fixed area of 0.5 cm2. The photoelectrochemical properties were measured with a 500 W Xe lamp. 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution was used as the electrolyte and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in a 0.1 M KCl solution containing 5 mM Fe(CN)63−/Fe(CN)64−; all measurements were performed under a N2 atmosphere.
3. Results and discussion
Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was applied to collect the elemental composition in the as-prepared CoFe2O4 and 3% CFB (pH = 1, 3 or 7) composites, and the results shown in Fig. S1.† As seen in Fig. S1a,† it could be noticed that the as-prepared CoFe2O4 nanoparticles were pure without any other elements present. In Fig. S1b–d,† it was very clear that Bi, O, Br, Co and Fe were present in the 3% CFB composites. XRD was employed to analyze the crystalline phase structure and crystallinity of the as-synthesized samples. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of several pristine BiOBr and 0.5% CFB samples prepared at different pH, respectively. As seen from the patterns obtained for BiOBr (pH = 1), BiOBr (pH = 3) and BiOBr (pH = 7), it was quite clear that the peaks at 10.95°, 21.99°, 25.26°, 31.81°, 32.31°, 33.25°, 34.21°, 39.43°, 44.85° and 50.84° could be perfectly indexed to the (001), (011), (012), (110), (003), (111), (112), (004) and (014) crystal planes of the P4/nmm tetragonal BiOBr crystal phase (JCPDS 73-2061) and without any other peaks did not belong to BiOBr existed, indicating that the BiOBr prepared at different pH had been successfully synthesized and their high crystallinity. When CoFe2O4 with different etched extents were added into the synthesis system, the as-obtained 0.5% CFB (pH = 1, 3 and 7) photocatalysts showed the same peaks with BiOBr, no shift or other peaks existed, manifesting that the introduction of CoFe2O4 did not cause any change to the BiOBr. Besides, there was no peak for CoFe2O4 observed in the 0.5% CFB (pH = 1, 3 and 7) composites. Considering that the content of CoxFeyO4 in 0.5% CFB (pH = 1, 3 and 7) composites was probably too low to been detected, the existence of CoxFeyO4 should be further proved by the next measurements. All the samples were dissolved in aqua regia and prepared as a certain concentration solution. Then, the sample solution with a certain concentration was detected for changes in the molar ratio of Co/Fe. ICP-OES was used to determine the difference in the molar ratio of Co/Fe and the results shown in Table 1 imply that the molar ratio of Co/Fe in the CoFe2O4 sample was 1:2. Co and Fe in the 3% CFB composites obtained at different solution pH were etched to different degrees and the molar ratio of Co/Fe showed an increasing tendency as the pH increases.

The size and morphology of the as-prepared materials was studied and 3% CFB (pH = 1, 3 and 7) were chosen as the relatively intuitive observation targets. The SEM images of 3% CFB (pH = 1, 3 and 7) are shown in Fig. 2. As can be observed from the SEM images, the BiOBr materials prepared at different pH were all irregular sheets. In addition, the sheets became smaller and thinner as the pH changed from 1 to 7. According to Lu et al.,45 the existence of H+ ions can affect the formation process of BiOBr crystals. The dominant process was basically Bi(NO3)3·5H2O dissolved in water leading to the generation of H+ and more H+ ions will hinder the nucleation of the BiOBr crystals. Therefore, less H+ ions meant the formation of more BiOBr crystal nuclei, which may be the reason why the size of the BiOBr crystals ranges from about 4 μm to 0.5 μm when NaOH was added to the process to reduce the amount of H+ ions present. Given that the CoFe2O4 nanoparticles were introduced into the crystal-formation process, the uniformly distributed particles with a sizes in the range of 15–30 nm observed on the BiOBr sheets may be the etched CoFe2O4.

To further observe the difference between CoxFeyO4 form under the three etching pH conditions, the TEM images of the three samples were recorded and shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3a–c display the TEM images of the 3% CFB (pH = 1, 3 and 7) composites, respectively. Notably, the CoxFeyO4 nanoparticles in the 3% CFB (pH = 1) and 3% CFB (pH = 3) composites were uniformly dispersed on the materials surfaces, which showed a better dispersion than that of the 3% CFB (pH = 7) composite. From Fig. 3c, the obvious CoxFeyO4 agglomeration indicated that less active sites were formed on the surface of the 3% CFB (pH = 7) composite and subsequently, could be unfavorable for the photocatalytic reaction.
 Fig. 3  TEM images of 3% CFB (pH = 1) (a), 3% CFB (pH = 3) (b) and 3% CFB (pH = 7) (c). 
The optical absorption of the as-prepared materials was measured. Fig. 4a–c presents the spectra of BiOBr and 0.5% CFB (pH = 1, 3 or 7). As seen from the results, the introduction of CoFe2O4 undoubtedly heightened the absorbance of the as-prepared composites in the visible-light region (λ ≥ 420 nm), speculating that it was favorable to absorb visible-light so that enough optical energy can be harvested to drive the photogeneration of h+ and e−. The Eg values obtained from the UV-vis DRS of BiOBr are shown in the insets. From the results, the Eg values of 2.75 eV, 2.77 eV and 2.7 eV should pertain to BiOBr (pH = 1, 3 and 7), respectively with no obvious change observed in the Eg values.

The H2O2 concentration changes observed using BiOBr (pH = 3) and 0.5% CFB (pH = 3) under visible-light irradiation were explored (Fig. 5). Ethanol was chosen as a h+ scavenger (VH2O:Vethanol = 1:9) in the irradiation process. The H2O2 concentration change was observed using a colorimetric DPD method.46 The results showed that BiOBr was a benign H2O2 producer and BiOBr (pH = 3) exhibited the best efficiency in which 145 μmol L−1 H2O2 was generated after 60 min. However, when combined with the etched CoFe2O4, the H2O2 production of all the 0.5% CFB photocatalysts showed an apparent decrease and the H2O2 concentration was almost lower than the detection limit of the DPD method, which may be attributed to the decomposition of H2O2 during the photoreaction. In other words, the 0.5% CFB (pH = 3) photocatalyst could produce more ˙O2− and ˙OH radicals than pristine BiOBr (pH = 3), which will contribute to the increased activity observed during the photocatalytic process. This phenomenon can be described as the two-electron reduction of O2 process under visible-light irradiation (eqn (3), (6), (8)–(11)). Moreover, the results can be proven using the subsequent ESR analysis.
 Fig. 5  H2O2 concentration generated during the visible-light irradiation process in the presence of the BiOBr and 0.5% CFB (pH = 1, 3 or 7) photocatalysts. 
The electron spin resonance (ESR) spin-trapping technique was used to detect the photo-generated reactive oxygen species over the samples under visible-light irradiation. Herein, we chose the BiOBr and 0.5% CFB (pH = 1, 3 or 7) photocatalysts as the substrates to investigate. The curves in Fig. 6a and b belong to the samples prepared at pH = 1 and there was no doubt that strong characteristic peaks of DMPO–˙O2− and DMPO–˙OH where present on both the BiOBr (pH = 1) and 0.5% CFB (pH = 1) samples under visible-light irradiation while no response was observed under dark conditions. Beyond that, the composites displayed much stronger characteristic peaks for both DMPO–˙O2− and DMPO–˙OH when compared to BiOBr (pH = 1). The same results were obtained for the samples prepared at pH = 3 (Fig. 6c and d) and pH = 7 (Fig. 6e and f). So, the characteristic peaks of DMPO–˙O2− and DMPO–˙OH observed for 0.5% CFB (pH = 1, 3 or 7) have stronger intensities than those observed for the pristine BiOBr samples, which agreed with the H2O2 concentration detection mentioned beforehand. Simultaneously, the ESR results also revealed that the ROSs were the significant photo-generated reactive species in the photocatalytic process and introducing CoFe2O4 can provide more active sites for O2 adsorption and H2O2 activation to produce more ˙O2− and ˙OH radicals.

To verify the speculation, BPA, an endocrine disruptor was selected as the target water contaminant to evaluate the photocatalytic properties of the as-synthesized materials. The BPA photodegradation with or without the as-prepared photocatalysts is displayed in Fig. 7a. Under visible-light (λ ≥ 420 nm) irradiation for 100 min, BPA showed its stability and the amount of self-degradation was insignificant. When the as-prepared photocatalysts were added into the BPA degradation system, BPA showed a drastic decrease in concentration. Besides, the 0.5% CFB (pH = 1, 3 or 7) composites showed enhanced photoactivity than the corresponding pristine BiOBr materials. From the results, BiOBr (pH = 1) and 0.5% CFB (pH = 1) showed a 49% and 67% BPA removal ability, respectively, whereas 50% and 56% BPA was degraded using BiOBr (pH = 7) and 0.5% CFB (pH = 7), respectively. It was notable that 0.5% CFB (pH = 3) displayed the best photocatalytic ability towards the photodegradation of BPA among all the as-prepared photocatalysts; 78% BPA was degraded while 58% BPA was eliminated using BiOBr (pH = 3) in 100 min. Interestingly, when compared with the pristine BiOBr materials, an utmost promotion of 42% was achieved using the 0.5% CFB (pH = 3) composite after 40 min of visible-light irradiation whereas 15% and 3% enhancements were observed using 0.5% CFB (pH = 1) and 0.5% CFB (pH = 7), respectively. In other words, the optimal Co/Fe ratio was obtained at pH = 3. According to the BPA photodegradation results, the kinetics of the reaction can be described using pseudo-second-order kinetics (Fig. 7b). The reaction rate constants were 0.01937, 0.01931 and 0.01833 L mol−1 s−1 for BiOBr prepared at pH = 1, 3 and 7, respectively, and 0.03851, 0.06487 and 0.0224 L mol−1 s−1 for 0.5% CFB (pH = 1), 0.5% CFB (pH = 3) and 0.5% CFB (pH = 7), respectively. Therefore, 2.0, 3.4 and 1.2 fold enhancements were observed using 0.5% CFB when compared to BiOBr prepared at pH = 1, 3 and 7, respectively. The photodegradation of BPA using the blends of CoFe2O4 and BiOBr (pH = 3) were also investigated to study the interaction between the two materials and the results are shown in Fig. 7c. When compared with BiOBr (pH = 3), the mixture of BiOBr (pH = 3) and CoFe2O4 showed an apparent decrease of about 15%. HPLC was applied to analyze the products of BPA degradation and the remaining liquid samples in the presence of 0.5% CFB (pH = 3) were detected (Fig. 7d). The peaks with retention time centered at 5.06 min were attributed to BPA. Note that the main peak intensity decreased as the irradiation time was extended, which implied the gradual destruction of the molecular structure of BPA. In addition, the peaks centered at 3.54 min can be ascribed to the intermediate product 4-(4-hydroxybenzylidene)cyclohexa-2,5-dienone, the peaks intensity increased gradually after 80 min and decreased after 100 min, further revealing that BPA was successfully removed using 0.5% CFB (pH = 3).47,48 The respective molecular structure is exhibited in Fig. S2.† The BPA degradation efficiency of the different photocatalysts was captured using a UV-vis spectrophotometer and the results were given in Fig. S3.† From these spectra, the maximum absorption peak of BPA (λ = 227 nm) gradually decreased as the irradiation time passed. 0.5% CFB (pH = 3) showed the fastest decrease among all the photocatalysts at the same time interval, which indicated its excellent photocatalytic ability after being modified by an appropriate pH solution environment.

(c) The BPA photodegradation activity observed with the blends of CoFe2O4 and BiOBr (pH = 3). (d) HPLC chromatograms of the degradation of BPA using 0.5% CFB (pH = 3). 
The results were in accordance with the H2O2 concentration detection and ESR analysis, which certified the aforementioned speculation. In the synthesis of the CFB (pH = 1, 3 and 7) composites, CoFe2O4 could be corroded partly by the H+ caused by Bi(NO3)3·5H2O hydrolysis and the corrosion extent of CoFe2O4 could be controlled by adjusting the solution pH. Thus, the CoxFeyO4 generated from CoFe2O4 corrosion will act as the Fenton agent for an in situ Fenton-like reaction to convert H2O2 into ROSs and further degrade the contamination on the interface of the composites. It was noteworthy that the BPA concentration exhibited no decrease when 1 mmol H2O2 was added alone, which signified that H2O2 participated in the Fenton-like photocatalytic system with the etched CoxFeyO4.
The cycling experiments for BPA photodegradation were carried out to evaluate the stability of the 0.5% CFB (pH = 3) photocatalyst. The initial concentration of the 0.5% CFB (pH = 3) photocatalyst was 1 g L−1 in 10 mg L−1 BPA and the results were shown in Fig. 8. Intuitively, after three cycles of BPA photodegradation, the 0.5% CFB (pH = 3) composite still obtained a high efficiency of about 83% BPA degradation. When compared with the first BPA photodegradation, the small decrease may be caused by material loss. The results proved that the 0.5% CFB (pH = 3) composite exhibits good stability. Fig. S4† shows the structural and morphological changes of the as-prepared photocatalyst after the cycling experiments. It was very clear from Fig. S4a† that the cycled 0.5% CFB (pH = 3) composite showed no other peaks except for all the peaks of the P4/nmm tetragonal BiOBr crystal phases (JCPDS 73-2061), which implied the chemical stability of the samples. In order to reveal the morphological change more clearly, 3% CFB (pH = 3) was chosen as the test sample. However, after three cycles, the BiOBr (pH = 3) plates tended to be broken into pieces after the prolonged time under vigorous stirring and the CoxFeyO4 nanoparticles on the surface of BiOBr (pH = 3) showed some agglomeration (Fig. S4b†), which may be the main reason why the photoactivity displayed a slight decrease after three cycles.

Photocurrent analysis was used to examine the separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Photocurrent derived from the photogenerated electrons during the separation process. It has been proven that a higher photoelectric current is due to an enhanced separation efficiency of the e−–h+ pairs and longer lifetime of the charge carriers, which contributes to the enhanced photoactivity.49Fig. 9a shows the photocurrent density of the BiOBr (pH = 3) and 0.5% CFB (pH = 3) sample electrodes. 0.5% CFB (pH = 3) possesses a similar relative photoelectric current density to BiOBr (pH = 3) with no increase in the composites showing that the CoxFeyO4 had not been motivated by the light and the e−CB of BiOBr (pH = 3) could not transfer into the CoxFeyO4 nanoparticles. Previous reports have also explored this.50 The charge transfer resistance can be estimated by EIS measurements. The measurement results of the BiOBr (pH = 3) and 0.5% CFB (pH = 3) electrode materials are shown in Fig. 9b. It could be observed that the Nyquist circle diameter of 0.5% CFB (pH = 3) was slightly larger than BiOBr (pH = 3), which was further proof that the introduction of CoxFeyO4 contributed no help to the interface transformation of e−CB.

Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was performed to estimate the recombination rate of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs. The BiOBr (pH = 3) and 0.5% CFB (pH = 3) materials were chosen as the substrates for the PL measurements and the results shown in Fig. 10. As seen from the PL spectra, the 0.5% CFB (pH = 3) photocatalyst exhibited an emission peak centered at 468 nm at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm, which possessed a lower fluorescent intensity when compared with BiOBr (pH = 3), showing that the photogenerated e−–h+ pairs of the 0.5% CFB (pH = 3) photocatalyst displayed a longer lifespan and a higher separation efficiency for the photogenerated e−–h+ pairs. This is pretty helpful in enhancing the photoactivity of the material.

Radical trapping experiments were used to analyze the active radical species in the photodegradation process. The 0.5% CFB (pH = 3) photocatalyst in the presence of different scavengers under visible-light irradiation was investigated and the results shown in Fig. 11. Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA-2Na), catalase (CAT), 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (TEMPOL) and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) were added to the in situ Fenton reaction system to quench the photogenerated holes (h+), in situ generated H2O2, superoxide radicals (˙O2−) and hydroxyl radicals (˙OH), respectively. The photoactivity of BPA degradation exhibited an arresting decrease in the presence of EDTA-2Na, indicating that h+ were one of dominant reactive species in the photocatalytic system. In contrast, BPA photodegradation using the 0.5% CFB (pH = 3) composite was inhibited at the same level when TEMPO and IPA were added to the photoreaction system, indicating that ˙O2− and ˙OH were active in the photodegradation process. When the H2O2 generated by the in situ Fenton system was removed by CAT, a partial inhibition of BPA photodegradation may be due to the deficiency of H2O2. It is well known that H2O2 was a key resource of ROSs in Fenton system. Hence the deficiency of H2O2 would impede the formation of ROSs and consequently inhibit the photocatalytic process. In view of the results, h+ was considered as the main species in the photoreaction while ROSs (˙O2− and ˙OH) contributed with an assistance effect.

Based on above analysis, a possible photocatalytic mechanism was proposed to explain the in situ Fenton-like reaction process of BPA degradation over the 0.5% CFB (pH = 3) photocatalyst (Fig. 12). Activated by visible-light, the e− and h+ in BiOBr (pH = 3) were separated, e− transfers to the conduction band (CB) while h+ remains in the valence band (VB). After this, the BiOBr (pH = 3) photocatalyst can generate H2O2 on the interface via the two-electron reduction of O2 under visible-light irradiation. Acid etched CoxFeyO4 on the surface of BiOBr (pH = 3) can facilitate H2O2 conversion to ROSs at the same time, rather than being activated by visible-light to transfer the e−CB of BiOBr (pH = 3). Interestingly, both Fe and Co are involved in the Fenton-like reaction, thus creating two redox cycles with H2O2 generated by BiOBr (pH = 3).51–53 H2O2 was decomposed into ˙O2− and ˙OH radicals via the two Fenton-like cycles (eqn (8)–(11) and (6)). Finally, BPA can be degraded by the photogenerated h+VB, ˙O2− and ˙OH. This strategy overcomes the shortcomings of the traditional Fenton reaction, making the in situ solid–aqueous-interfacial Fenton reaction possible. Avoiding the secondary pollution caused by Fe3+ leaking and mild reaction conditions can also provide a positive effect on practical environmental remedy applications.

4. Conclusions
Acid etched CFB photocatalytic materials were synthesized using a simple hydrothermal method, in which CoFe2O4 was etched to different extents by adjusting the solution pH (pH = 1, 3 and 7) during the preparation process. All the prepared materials were well crystallized. The BiOBr plates became smaller as the pH increases. This was attributed to the lower amount of H+ resulting in the generation of more BiOBr crystal nuclei. The atomic ratio of Co/Fe in the CFB photocatalysts was detected using ICP-OES measurements and the relative content of Co/Fe atoms in the different CFB photocatalysts changed as the pH was altered. The optimal Co/Fe molar ratio for BPA degradation under visible-light irradiation was obtained at pH = 3. In other words, 0.5% CFB (pH = 3) showed the best photoactivity for BPA degradation with 78% BPA was degraded in 100 min and was enhanced by 20% when compared to BiOBr (pH = 3). 0.5% CFB (pH = 3) exhibited a BPA photodegradation rate constant of 0.06487 L mol−1 s−1, which was 3.4 times higher than that of BiOBr (pH = 3). About 145 μmol L−1 H2O2 was generated after 60 min using BiOBr (pH = 3) under visible-light irradiation, which can be decomposed immediately by the acid etched CoxFeyO4 (formed at pH = 3) on the BiOBr (pH = 3) surface. Thus, more ˙O2− and ˙OH radicals were generated to participate in the photocatalytic reaction process. The whole process includes three steps: i) BiOBr (pH = 3) was activated by visible-light irradiation to generate h+VB and e−CB that then produced H2O2 on the surface of the BiOBr (pH = 3) via a two-electron reduction of O2 process, b) H2O2 was converted into ˙O2− and ˙OH radicals under the acceleration of CoxFeyO4 nanoparticles loaded on the BiOBr (pH = 3) surface under visible-light irradiation and iii) the ˙O2−, ˙OH and h+VB participate in the BPA photodegradation process. This in situ H2O2 production and Fenton-like photocatalytic system efficiency degrades BPA, successfully avoided the drawbacks of the classical Fenton reaction and demonstrates the controllable construction of CFB materials.
