    , Accepted 25th December 2017First published on 2nd January 2018AbstractDye sensitizers play an important role in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). As a promising strategy for the design of novel porphyrin sensitizers, the asymmetric modification of the porphyrin ring to meso-link porphyrin sensitizer has emerged in recent years, which can improve the light-harvesting properties and enhance the electron distribution. In this work, in order to reveal the essence of the effect of unsymmetrical substitution on the performance of β-link porphyrin dyes in DSSCs, four kinds of common β-link porphyrin dyes with different structures are calculated by using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). The electronic structures and optical properties of these studied dyes in dimethylformamide (DMF) are also investigated. The key parameters of the short-circuit current density (Jsc), including light harvesting efficiency (LHE), electron injection driving force (ΔGinject), and intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT) are discussed in detail. In addition, the periodic DFT calculations in the dye–TiO2 systems are also employed to investigate the geometrical and electronic injection process of the different connection types of these studied dyes adsorbed on the periodic TiO2 model with an exposed anatase (101) surface. We expect the present study would deepen the understanding of the alternative function of unsymmetrical substitution and may contribute to future DSSC design.
1. Introduction
Nowadays, humans are facing a series of serious challenges along with industrial developments, such as air pollution, greenhouse effect, climate change, and so on. Therefore, there is an increasing demand for renewable clean energy due to ecological problems and the limited availability of traditional fossil fuels.1,2 Among a variety of clean energy sources, solar energy is the most abundant clean energy source available.3 Hence, converting solar light to energy has enormously attracted the interest of researchers. As a promising photovoltaic device, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted widespread attention due to their low fabrication cost, ease of manufacture, good flexibility and relatively high light-to-electric energy conversion efficiencies since the revolutionary work reported by O’Regan and Grätzel in 1991.4 They simulate natural photosynthesis systems, and a typical DSSC consists of four major parts: metal oxide semiconductor electrode, dye sensitizers, liquid redox electrolyte and platinum-coated counter electrode.5–7 As an important component in DSSCs, dye sensitizers play a crucial role in promoting a higher efficiency of solar-to-electricity energy conversion.
In fact, various types of dye sensitizers (such as ruthenium complexes,8–10 porphyrin sensitizers11,12 and metal-free organic dyes13,14) have been synthesized. However, natural pigments (such as chlorophylls, carotene and anthocyanin) were chosen finally in nature to harvest light in complicated photo-synthetic processes. Inspired by natural photosynthesis systems, porphyrins are the main structure of natural chlorophylls, and scientists believe that obtaining porphyrins as an efficient center can provide tips on possible materials for improving the performance of DSSCs.15 Thus, the porphyrin sensitizers are considered to be promising candidates for DSSCs owing to their rigid structures with many reaction sites, large absorption coefficients and tunable spectral properties in the visible region. Interestingly, the natures of metal porphyrin and organic porphyrin are different. Based on the previous research,16 the porphyrins with metal ions are more suitable to be used as the efficient center for sensitizers due to their attractive electronic and optical properties and good photovoltaic performance. Up to now, the DSSCs have achieved a conversion efficiency exceeding 12% with cobalt(II/III) electrolyte (12.3% with YD2-o-C8 dye11 and 13% with SM315 dye12). These milestones are stimulating investigation of the development of further porphyrin sensitizers to develop DSSCs with high efficiency.
From a structural point of view, there are two major points in a porphyrin macrocycle—four meso and eight β-positions. Hence, these positions may be used for modification with carboxylic acid or another substituent as an anchoring group attached to the surface of the metal oxide semiconductor electrode. Therefore, according to the connection position of the anchoring group, the porphyrin sensitizers are broadly divided into two categories: meso11,12 and β-linked17–19 porphyrin sensitizers. However, an interesting phenomenon is that the efficiency of meso-linked porphyrin sensitizers is generally higher than that of β-linked ones. Indeed, Nazeeruddin and co-workers12 reported that the meso-linked dye SM315 achieved a power conversion efficiency of 13% in 2014. In addition, regarding β-linked porphyrin sensitizers, the tda-2b-bd-Zn dye reported by Ishida et al. in 2011 achieved the efficiency of 7.5%.17 Then Ishida et al. investigated 6 β-linked prospective zinc porphyrins and reported the best one (ZnBD2 dye) to have a power conversion efficiency of 8.2% with a cobalt-based electrolyte.20 In 2016, Covezzi and co-workers reported a β-substituted porphyrin with a 4D–π–1A architecture and four diarylamino groups in the meso positions for which the porphyrin coded as G2 exhibits the best performance with a conversion efficiency of 8.79% in the presence of co-adsorbent chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA).21 Although the β-linked porphyrin sensitizer systems are not very prominent in terms of efficiency, research strategies that can improve their efficiency are also very meaningful. In general, the absorption range of β-linked porphyrin sensitizers is greater and wider than that of meso-linked porphyrin sensitizers, and therefore a higher current value can be produced. In practical application, the current intensity of DSSC devices is very important. For instance, the short-circuit current density of the DSSCs using the tda-2b-bd-Zn dye is 18.4 mA cm−2, while the use of the dye SM315 is only 18.1 mA cm−2.
In many improvement strategies,22 unsymmetrical substitution of the porphyrin macrocycle is a promising method due to its simple structure and high efficiency. Recently, Sundström and Imahori et al. have successfully applied this strategy to design novel meso-linked porphyrin sensitizers.23 They designed and synthesized the meso-linked dye ZnPBAT, a kind of asymmetrical porphyrin dye with enhanced “push–pull” character, in which two diphenylamino groups serve as strong π-coupled donors and one ethynylcarboxyphenyl group acts as the adsorption group. Compared with dye YD2 (9.1%),24 the efficiency of dye ZnPBAT (10.1%) is relatively higher under similar optimization conditions. In addition, from the point of view of synthesis technology, a new series of β-substituted porphyrins have been synthesized and the influence of unsymmetrical substitution on the properties (photophysical and electrochemical) of these compounds has been recently elucidated.25
In this work, we want to use this unsymmetrical substitution approach to improve the efficiency of β-linked porphyrin sensitizers. Moreover, unlike the meso-linked dyes, an interesting phenomenon by this method is that the β-linked porphyrin dye system will produce two configurations: one with the substitution and adsorption groups on the same side; the other has the two groups appearing on two different sides. Hence, it is necessary to determine the optimal configuration in the work. Finally, the properties of the isolated dyes such as electronic structure, absorption spectra and intra-molecular charge transfer are systematically analysed, where some important information can be revealed. In addition, the interaction between dye and semiconductor during the interfacial charge injection process was also investigated for insight into analysing the properties of the dye–TiO2 systems, and thus, to improve our comprehension of the dye molecular engineering in DSSCs.
2. Computational details
In this work, all calculations of the isolated dye were performed using the Gaussian 09 suite of programs (Revision D.01).26 All ground state geometries of the isolated dye were carried out by employing the B3LYP functional27 with LanL2DZ/6-31G(d) basis sets for Zn/C, N, O and H atoms. Based on such calculations, the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT)28–30 was used to explore the electronic properties of four Zn–porphyrin sensitizers. A series of different functions were performed to determine the proper function to be used in the evaluation of excitation energy of four Zn–porphyrin sensitizers (see Fig. S1, ESI†). Compared with the experimental data, it was shown that the excitation energy obtained by PBE031 is more accurate and reasonable. Therefore, the spectroscopic absorptions of four Zn–porphyrin sensitizers were obtained using the PBE0 functional with 6-31G(d) (LanL2DZ for Zn atom). At the same time, the solvent effects of dimethylformamide (DMF) were considered by using the polarizable continuum model (PCM).32,33
In our calculations, the Gaussian curves were used to simulate all UV/Vis spectra under a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 0.10 eV. Furthermore, the calculation results of intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT) were obtained by the B3LYP functional with 6-31G(d) (LanL2DZ for Zn atom). The excited-state densities were calculated within the linear-response TD-DFT framework to account for a vertical approximation. The electron transfer distance and the fraction of electron exchange of the four Zn–porphyrin sensitizers that related to the vertical transitions were computed with Multiwfn 3.0.5.34
The TiO2 surface was obtained by appropriately cutting from the anatase slab and exposing the majority (101) surface. The TiO2(101) surface (360 atoms, 120:Ti, 240:O) was simulated by 6 × 4 unit cells with three periodic atom layers, and a vacuum region of 30 Å was used to remove any interactions between slabs. All periodic DFT calculations were carried out using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP 5.3).35,36 The projector augmented wave (PAW)37,38 pseudopotentials were employed to describe the electron-ion interactions. The exchange–correlation effects were treated by the Perdew and Wang (PW91) functional39 with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The energy cutoff for the plane-wave basis sets was set to be 400 eV. The Brillouin zones were sampled with the Monkhorst–Pack k-points of 1 × 1 × 1 for bulk calculation. A conjugated gradient algorithm with an energy criterion of 0.001 eV was used for atomic convergence, and it ensured that the forces were smaller than 0.03 eV Å−1 in all cases.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Molecular structure
In this work, the dye GD2,40 a β-linked porphyrin sensitizer with simple structure and high efficiency, was chosen as the theoretical model. The structure of the GD2 molecule can be divided into three parts, that is, the porphyrin ring with four aryl groups acting as electron donors, the alkene as a π-bridge for electron transport and the malonic acid group as an acceptor to attach to the semiconductor surface.
Moreover, based on the experimental report, the bis(4-methylphenyl)amine groups were used to asymmetrically modify the porphyrin ring. And, the position of substitution is one of two meso-sites of the porphyrin ring that is far away from the adsorption group. Moreover, as a contrast, the condition that the two meso-sites of the porphyrin ring were simultaneously modified was also taken into account in this work. Finally, the sensitizer GD2 and three substituted dyes, which are labeled as GD2-N1, GD2-N2 and GD2-2N (as shown in Scheme 1), were selected as models to investigate the effect of asymmetric modification of the porphyrin ring on the performance of β-linked porphyrin sensitizer.

3.2. Electronic structure
It is very meaningful to analyze the electronic structure of dye molecules because the intrinsic electronic structure of a dye determines its extrinsic properties. In order to illuminate the effect of asymmetric modification of the porphyrin ring on β-linked porphyrin sensitizer, the energy of the selected frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) and the electron density diagrams of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) are given in Fig. 1. Furthermore, the important FMO compositions of the dye GD2, GD2-N1, GD2-N2 and GD2-2N in the dimethylformamide (DMF) solution are collected in Table S1 (ESI†).
 Fig. 1  All dye systems in DMF solution: (left) energetic level of frontier MOs and HOMO–LUMO energy gaps; (right) Molecular orbital profiles of HOMOs and LUMOs. 
From the energy level point of view, the energy levels of the dye sensitizers should be matched with the energy of the conduction band of TiO2 and the redox potential of the electrolyte. For the promising dye molecules, the energy of the LUMO should be higher than that of the conduction band of TiO2 (−4.00 eV vs. in vacuum7), and the energy of the HOMO should be lower than that of the redox potential of the electrolyte I−/I3− (−4.60 eV vs. in vacuum41). This is not only conducive to the injection of electrons from the excited sensitizer into the conduction band of the semiconductor electrode, but it can also make the excited sensitizer effectively obtain electrons from the redox electrolyte. Meanwhile, the smaller HOMO–LUMO energy gap means a lower energy can make the dye excited, so this can improve the light harvesting efficiency in the DSSC, especially to improve the ability to utilize long wavelength light. It should be noted that the LUMO energy levels of all dyes are higher than −4.0 eV, and their HOMO energy levels are lower than −4.6 eV. This means that these dyes are satisfactory in terms of energy level matching. When the porphyrin macrocycle connects with the bis(4-methylphenyl)amine groups, the change of LUMO energy levels of all dyes is not obvious, while the HOMO energy levels are gradually increased. Obviously, the HOMO–LUMO energy gaps of all dye systems decrease in the order of 2.219 eV (GD2-2N) > 2.323 eV (GD2-N2) > 2.334 eV (GD2-N1) > 2.582 eV (GD2). This result demonstrates that the absorption spectra of dye GD2-N1, GD2-N2 and GD2-2N are red-shifted through the modification of the porphyrin ring with an electron-donating group. These properties could be in favor of abundant absorption in the long-wavelength region.
On the other hand, from the composition point of view, the LUMOs of all dye systems can be classified as having a similar character, which is labeled as a contribution coming from the π* orbital of the Zn–porphyrin macrocycle, π-bridge and COOH groups, as shown in Fig. 1. Due to the similar character of the LUMOs for all the dye systems, we need to pay attention to the HOMOs. Overall, the HOMOs are primarily localized on the Zn–porphyrin macrocycle with partial contribution from aryl groups or bis(4-methylphenyl)amine groups. It is known that an efficient charge separated state must be constituted with the occupied molecular orbital localized on the donor part and the unoccupied molecular orbital localized on the acceptor part. Hence, these dye sensitizers show distinct push–pull character, which will favor charge injection from the excited sensitizer to the semiconductor.
3.3. Absorption spectra of isolated dyes
It is significant to examine the nature of the absorption spectra of isolated dyes, because the dyes with large photocurrent response should have broad and strong absorption. In an ideal situation, it overlaps with the whole visible and near-infrared region of the solar spectrum. The absorption spectra of the four dye systems based on the calculated absorption data are shown in Fig. 2. The results of absorption associated with its oscillator strength, main excitation, and assignment as well as experimental results are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†).
 Fig. 2  Simulated absorption spectra of dyes GD2, GD2-N1, GD2-N2 and GD2-2N in DMF solution. 
For the dye GD2 system, four strong absorption bands were obtained with the absorption peaks at 328, 388, 469 and 607 nm, which are comparable to the measured values at 319, 364, 444 and 612 nm, respectively. The simulated results agree well with the experimental data, indicating that the employed theoretical method is reliable. It can be clearly seen that the absorption spectrum of dye GD2 has the obvious characteristic absorption of the porphyrin,42 that is, it shows the Q band at about 600 nm, and the Soret band (which splits into three bands) in the region between 350 and 450 nm. The absorption of the Q band at 469 nm can be appointed to the excitation of HOMO → LUMO. According to the analysis of the frontier molecular orbital (see Fig. 1), this excitation can be ascribed to the charge transfer from the Zn–porphyrin to the π-conjugation bridge and the COOH group. In addition, for the other three strong absorptions of the Soret band, although they are caused by the transition between different molecular orbits, the main character of these transitions is the same. These can also be ascribed to the charge transfer from the Zn–porphyrin to the π-conjugation bridge. Overall, we deem that dye GD2 shows promise for the utilization of light and will be conducive to obtaining efficient DSSCs in practical application.
On the whole, when the porphyrin is modified by the electron-donating group, the absorption spectra of the dyes GD2-N1, GD2-2N and GD2-2N are obviously red shifted. There is no obvious characteristic absorption of porphyrin in these systems. Similarly, the excitation of HOMO → LUMO leads to the lowest energy absorption of the dye GD2-N1, GD2-2N, and GD2-2N systems at 676, 682 and 722 nm, respectively, which can also be assigned as charge transfer from the Zn–porphyrin and DPA groups to the π-conjugation bridge. Compared with the dye GD2 system, the dye GD2-N1, GD2-2N and GD2-2N systems not only enhance the absorption capacity in the near infrared region, but also produce more absorption bands in the visible region. This indicates that adjusting porphyrin with the electron-donating group is an effective strategy to tune and improve the absorption of the dye, which is in favor of improving light harvesting efficiency (LHE) and thereby affecting the performance of the DSSC.
Moreover, compared with the dye GD2 and GD2-2N systems, the absorption spectra of dye molecules with an unsymmetrically modified porphyrin ring show obviously enhanced oscillator strengths. As an indicator of incident sunlight-to-electricity conversion efficiency, light harvesting efficiency (ηLHE(λ)) represents the ability of dyes to harvest light. Based on a simple and clear equation, the ηLHE(λ) at the given wavelength λ can be calculated as8,43 ηLHE(λ) = 1–10−Γσ(λ)(1)where, Γ is the surface loading of sensitizers (mol cm−2) grafted onto the semiconductor. In the current work, Γ is set to 5.43 × 10−7 mol cm−2. σ(λ) is the molecular absorption cross-section (cm2 mol−1). It is related to the molar absorption coefficient (ε(λ)) and can be expressed as follows:8,44 σ(λ) = 1000 × ε(λ)(2)
In the simulated absorption spectra, the oscillator strengths correspond to the molar absorption coefficient measured experimentally. According to eqn (1) and (2), accompanied by the increase of molar absorption coefficient, the ηLHE(λ) will be higher. The ηLHE(λ) curves for all sensitizers are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). As depicted in Fig. S2 (ESI†), it is apparent that the GD2-N1 and GD2-N2 dyes have wider coverage and higher ηLHE(λ) at 700–800 nm than the others, and this means that the GD2-N1 and GD2-N2 dyes will be better in light harvesting.
To summarize, for the isolated dye sensitizer, the tactics of unsymmetrical modification of the porphyrin ring can efficiently tune the energy level distribution and LUMO component as well as bring satisfactory the absorption spectrum, which contribute to a higher photon to current conversion efficiency in DSSCs.
3.4. Intra-molecular charge transfer
Effective electron–hole separation of the dye sensitizer is a crucial factor to obtain high photocurrent conversion efficiency. It originated from the intra-molecular electronic excitation to a charge transfer state upon photo-excitation. According to the actual working condition and the molecular structure of dyes, we believe that the classic model—Marcus theory can be used to deal with the intra-molecular electron transfer. This is because the transition process is based on the Franck–Condon principle and does not consider the influence of the nuclear quantum tunneling effect in the calculation. Ciofini et al. put forward a simple and effective dipolar approach to quantify charge transfer phenomena.45 And, this method was successfully used to study every electron transition of various types of dye molecules, such as Ru-based complexes, organic sensitizers and Zn–porphyrin sensitizers.46–48 Actually, in order to gain insight into the charge separation state, we also analyze the properties of the electronic transitions that are responsible for the absorption spectrum of four dye systems. Due to the electron density, difference plots gave a clear vision of electron movement after photo-excitation; the relevant difference density plots of the four dye systems are collected in Fig. 3. Besides, the key parameters and the associated indexes of the four dye systems were calculated and are presented in Table 1. The meaning of each index in the Table 1 is as follows:

• DCT is the distance of charge transfer, and is the difference between R+ and R−. Two functions ρ+(r) and ρ−(r) can be given to define the increase and decrease of the density owing to the electron transition. The barycenters of the spatial regions defined by ρ+(r) and ρ−(r), can be written as:  and . This index can give a quantitative estimation of the charge transfer length.
• qCT is the transferred charge. It can be obtained by integrating over all space ρ+(r) (or ρ−(r)).
• H is the half of the sum of the Gaussian distribution axis along the D–A direction.
• t is the difference between DCT and H, which is a tool that can be used to define the degree of through space character of an electronic transition. The smaller the value, the better the separation.
Firstly, it should be noted that the calculated t index values of all dyes are lower than 1.6 Å, which is a defined threshold in the previous literature,45 indicating that the functional is able to provide a correct description of the transition energy associated with a CT excitation. Furthermore, for H ≥ DCT, the extent of orbital overlap between the regions of density depletion and increment is expected. In the dye GD2 system, the 1st, 3rd and 6th transitions have charge transfer character. This analysis is numerically quantified by the inspection of the computed associated DCT values, which are 2.960, 3.467 and 3.086 Å, respectively. Moreover, the qCT values of the 1st, 3rd and 6th transitions are 0.374, 0.582 and 0.613 e, respectively. From the above data, we believe that the dye GD2 has a weak ability to use the light in the low energy region (long wavelength region). In addition, as shown in Fig. 3, the most efficient transition for charge injection seems to be the 3rd one since it combines desirable DCT and qCT values with a strong increase in the electronic density of the anchoring group that could lead to quick electron injection by enhancing the electronic coupling between the sensitizer and the semiconductor surface.
Compared with the dye GD2 system, the numbers of major transitions increased significantly for other systems. This means that these dyes have better absorption of visible light. That is to say, there is more energy to make these dyes excited in the energy range of visible light. For the charge transfer under the first excited state of the dye GD2-N1, GD2-N2 and GD2-2N systems, the DCT values are 3.894, 4.035, and 3.497 Å, respectively, which are much larger than that of the dye GD2 system (2.960 Å). Moreover, the qCT values of the dye GD2-N1, GD2-N2 and GD2-2N systems are 0.808, 0.786, and 0.787 e, respectively, which are also much larger than that of the dye GD2 system (0.374 e). These results demonstrate that the dyes possess a better absorption capacity under the long wavelength range of light after they are modified by the electron-donating group. As can be seen from Fig. 3, in general, these dyes also have a good electron injection capability. All major transitions show similar properties of charge transfers from Zn–porphyrin and electron-donating groups to the anchoring group. Hence, the utilization of the electron-donating group to modify the porphyrin macrocycle for β-linked porphyrin sensitizer has a positive effect on the intra-molecular charge transfer property of sensitizers in DSSCs.
More interestingly, we find that the dye molecules with the unsymmetrically modified porphyrin ring have better properties of intra-molecular charge transfer. For the dye GD2-N1 and GD2-N2 systems, both the distance of charge transfer and the transferred charge are larger than those of the dye GD2 and GD2-2N systems. Besides, from the t index point of view, the degree and nature of charge separation are more satisfactory. In summary, the asymmetric substitution of β-linked porphyrin sensitizer is of great significance, which could be regarded as a promising approach to improve the efficiency of DSSCs.
3.5. Geometries and coupling of the sensitizers on TiO2 surface systems
What is more important is that the dye sensitizers are adsorbed on the semiconductor electrode in the DSSC device. The adsorption models of the dye attached on a semiconductor surface determine the efficiency of electron injection from the excited dye into the conduction band of a semiconductor electrode. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the interface interaction towards the optimal DSSC. Taking into account that there are many adsorption configurations of the sensitizers on the semiconductor surface (see Fig. S3, ESI†), according to the result of calculation, the optimized geometries for the two lowest energy and most stable adsorption modes of the anchor group are shown in Fig. 4. Moreover, the selected bond lengths, bond angles, and dihedral angles are presented in Table S3 (ESI†).
 Fig. 4  The representative geometry and numbering atoms of the two optimized adsorption modes for all dyes on the TiO2(101) surface. 
As a matter of fact, the dye sensitizers will dissociate and adsorb on the semiconductor surface. Moreover, titanium dioxide(101) surfaces, the most thermodynamically stable in nano-crystals, dominated the majority of the external surface of TiO2 (more than 94% percent).49 Following this, we investigate the connection type between dye molecules and the TiO2(101) model. The bidentate bridging type is adopted in this work based on the results of experiment and theory.50–52 Besides, in order to ensure the same number of atoms before and after the adsorption process, the dissociated H atoms of sensitizers are adsorbed on the O atom of the TiO2 model. At last, there are two most reasonable adsorption configurations in this work, one (A geometry) is the two –COOH groups of malonic acid binding to two Ti atoms of TiO2 model, respectively; the other (B geometry) is a –COOH group of malonic acid adsorbed on the TiO2 model.
On the whole, under the same adsorption configuration conditions, the difference of all the structural parameters is not obvious in the various dye systems. This is mainly because these dye sensitizers possess the same connection portions though the electron donor parts are different. In addition, the main difference of the structure parameters is some bond angles and dihedral angles between two different adsorption configurations. Because the number of carboxyl groups involved in the two adsorption configurations is different, in order to achieve stable adsorption, the rotation of some single bonds in the malonic acid group leads to the difference of these angles. However, it is noteworthy that the bond length between the O atom of the acceptor part and the Ti atom of the TiO2 model has obviously changed, where the bond lengths in the A adsorption geometry are shorter than that in the B adsorption geometry. This means that there is a stronger interaction between the dye molecules and the semiconductor in the A configuration.
The study of net charge transfer from the dyes to the semiconductor was reported by Ronca et al. in 2012.53 Based on a partial integration of the electron density difference between a bound system and its separated fragments, they computationally investigated the adsorption of several organic dyes on TiO2 models. They clearly demonstrated that an extensive charge rearrangement accompanies the dye–TiO2 interaction, which amounts to a transfer of up to 0.3–0.4 e from the dyes to the semiconductor. In our models, the values of net charge transfer are slightly different from this result, and therefore we assumed that the main reason for this difference is that the anchoring groups are different (carboxylic acid and malonic acid). Finally, we consider that our results are reasonable and reliable by taking into account the adsorption configuration and charge transfer value.
Based on the above two types of stable configurations, the average Bader atomic charges for the malonic acid group in the dye molecule attached to TiO2(101) and for a bare molecule are listed in Table 2. For the A adsorption geometry systems, the stronger interaction of the dyes with the TiO2(101) surface results in a noticeable charge transfer of ∼0.5 e from the dye sensitizer to the surface, which shows that for an isolated dye, the average charge on the oxygen atoms connected to the Ti atom (∼1.90 e) is obviously reduced when the molecule is anchored to the surface (∼1.65 e), while the average charge of the Ti atoms in the clean surface increases when the dye is adsorbed. The charge transfer of all dye systems decreases in the order of 0.587 e (GD2-N1) > 0.508 e (GD2-N2) > 0.490 (GD2-2N) ≈ 0.489 (GD2). Furthermore, compared with the A adsorption geometry systems, the biggest difference is that the charge transfer significantly decreased for the B adsorption geometry systems, only about half of the former. This may be determined by the number of carboxyl groups involved in the adsorption process between dyes and semiconductor surface. From the point of view of adsorption structure, the dye molecules have multiple adsorption groups, and all adsorption groups adsorbed on the semiconductor electrode surface is the most ideal situation.54 The charge transfer of all dye systems decreases in the order of 0.317 e (GD2-N2) > 0.282 e (GD2-N1) > 0.268 (GD2-2N) ≈ 0.267 (GD2). It is worth noting that the charge transfer seems to follow the trend in interaction strength, namely the interaction strength increases while more charge transfers from the dye molecule to the semiconductor surface. More importantly, under the same conditions, the charge transfer of the systems of porphyrin with unsymmetrically modified porphyrin is obviously higher than that of the symmetric porphyrin systems. Another important factor is the effect of dye orientation on the TiO2 surface.55,56 In this work, the properties of the A adsorption geometry systems are distinctly superior to those of the B adsorption geometer systems; this is because the B adsorption geometry systems will lead to fast charge recombination between the dye molecule and semiconductor surface, and ultimately reduce performance.

3.6. Dynamics of electron injection
In order to investigate the electron injection dynamic processes thoroughly, the dynamics of interfacial electron transfer has been simulated in the IET (Interfacial Electron Transfer) code,57,58 and the time-dependent survival probability for all dye–TiO2 systems is shown in Fig. 5. Moreover, the densities of photo-excited electrons under two different configuration conditions for all dye–TiO2 systems are illustrated in Fig. 6 (in configuration A) and Fig. S4 (ESI†) (in configuration B).
 Fig. 5  The time-dependent survival probability for all dyes linked on TiO2 model systems. 
 Fig. 6  Densities of photo-excited electrons for all dye-sensitized TiO2 systems under the condition of the A adsorption configuration. 
As can be seen from Fig. 5, the electron gradually delocalizes and is injected into the TiO2 semiconductor within the 200 fs time scale. It is clearly observed from Fig. 6 that the nature of the injected electron diffusion and the subsequent relaxation mechanism can be described. At first, the charge density is mainly populated in the dye molecule at 0 fs, and it subsequently spreads to the TiO2 semiconductor. Finally, to reach an equilibrium state, the initial population in the sensitizer decays to some extent. In the case of configuration A, the electron is located at the dye sensitizer at the initial time, and then it begins to be rapidly injected and finally evolves into stable states after ∼100 fs (survival probability ∼5%). Specifically, the survival probability in dye-sensitized TiO2 decays to about half at ∼16 fs. While, in the case of configuration B, all the dye systems exhibit a slower electron transfer and an incomplete electron injection after ∼200 fs (survival probability ∼15%). The survival probabilities of all dye systems remain at 50% at ∼60 fs, which is a larger IET time scale compared with that of configuration A. By comparison, it is indicated that configuration A could facilitate the faster electron injection process.
However, in either case of adsorption configuration, the electron injection process of dye GD2-N2 is the fastest among all dye systems. According to the results of previous analyses, this shows that the porphyrin ring with asymmetric structure is the key factor, and the asymmetrically modified position on the porphyrin ring is also an important factor for β-linked porphyrin sensitizers.
3.7. The theoretical understanding of the complexes in DSSCs
As is well known to all, the overall efficiency (η) of the DSSCs is defined by the ratio of the maximum output electrical power of the DSSCs to the energy of incident sunlight (Pin), which is determined by the short-circuit current density (Jsc), the open-circuit photo-voltage (Voc), the fill factor (ff) and the Pin (generally AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2). The overall efficiency was calculated according to the following equation:59 (3)

Short-circuit current density Jsc. 
Accordingly, the photocurrent per unit area (mA cm−2) is expressed by the Jsc when a DSSC under irradiation is short-circuited, which is related to the interaction between TiO2 and the dye as well as the absorption coefficient of the dye. The value of Jsc in DSSCs can be calculated as:60 (4)where LHE(λ) is the light harvesting efficiency at a given wavelength, Φinject denotes the electron injection efficiency, and ηcollect is the charge collection efficiency. At the same time, a large Φinject based on the above equation could also guarantee a high Jsc. Φinject is affected by the free enthalpy (ΔG) related to the electron injection from the photo-induced excited states of dyes into the TiO2 surface. ΔG determines the electron injection rate and can be viewed as the electron injection driving force (ΔGinject).61,62 Φinject ∝ f(−ΔGinject)(5) ΔGinject = Edye* − ECB = Edye − E0–0 − ECB(6)where Edye* is the oxidation potential energy of the dye in the excited state and ECB is the reduction potential of the TiO2 conduction band (CB). Therefore, we used ECB = −4.0 eV in this work for TiO2, which has been widely used in previous research.63Edye is the oxidation potential energy of the dye in the ground state, while E0–0 is the electronic vertical transition energy.


Open circuit photovoltage Voc. 

V
oc is defined as the voltage difference between the electrolyte redox potential (Eredox/q) and the quasi-Fermi potential of electrons (EF,n/q) in the TiO2 semiconductor. The Voc in DSSCs is expressed by:64 (7)where ECB is the conduction band edge of the semiconductor, Eredox is the electrolyte Fermi level, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, q is the unit charge, nc is the number of electrons in the conduction band, and NCB is the accessible density of conduction band (CB) states. ΔCB is the shift of ECB when the dyes are adsorbed on the semiconductor surface.
Now, we assess the strategy of unsymmetrical modification of the porphyrin for β-linked porphyrin sensitizers from a theoretical point of view. We have provided some reasonable explanations for the influence of this strategy on the efficiency of the DSSCs. To gain insight into the efficiency of all dyes, the properties of photo-current and photo-voltage were simulated in this work. In order to evaluate the photo-current and photo-voltage performance of all dyes, the next two criteria are used to set up an effective ranking: (1) the LHE and ΔGinject of the dye should be as large as possible so as to enlarge Jsc; (2) raising the number of photoelectrons in the TiO2 conduction band to increase the Voc.
According to the analysis results of the absorption spectra properties in Section 3.4, we can conclude that the dyes GD2-N1 and GD2-N2 can lead to higher LHE values than that of the dyes GD2 and GD2-2N. Furthermore, the driving force of the electron injection (ΔGinject) is an important property that could help increase the Jsc values. Thus, the electronic injection free enthalpy ΔGinject, and ground (Edye) and excited state (Edye*) oxidation potentials computed for all dyes are summarized in Table 3. In general, Grätzel et al. recommended that the value of ΔGinject should be at least ∼0.5 eV higher than the ECB for efficient solar energy-to-current conversion.65 The ΔGinject values of all the studied dye systems are larger than 0.5 eV, thus guaranteeing an efficient electron injection process. As shown in Table 3, the calculated ΔGinject of all dye systems decreases in the order 1.49 eV (GD2-N2) > 1.26 eV (GD2-2N) > 1.23 eV (GD2-N1) > 1.08 eV (GD2). Balancing all parameters of the LHE and ΔGinject, the dye GD2-N2 should have a higher incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency and generate the largest Jsc in DSSCs in comparison to the others. Then, we know that besides the short-circuit current density Jsc, the overall power conversion efficiency also could be also influenced by the open-circuit voltage Voc. The larger number of electrons in the conduction band of the semiconductor could lead to an increase in the Voc. More efficient intra-molecular charge transfer and faster electron injection of the dye sensitizer would result in a larger nc, thereby producing a qualitatively higher Voc. According to the analysis results of Sections 3.3 and 3.4, we believe that dye GD2-N2 may have more advantage over the other dyes, due to its favorable properties of the above factors based on our computed results. In other words, the performance of DSSCs sensitized by dye GD2-N2 can produce the maximum Voc value.

4. Conclusions
In summary, theoretical calculations of the unsymmetrical approach have been performed on the four β-linked Zn–porphyrin sensitizer systems to reveal the electronic structures, optical properties, and intra-molecular charge transfer as well as electron injection processes. Based on the calculated results, they can be summarized as follows:
Firstly, we believe that this strategy is a promising approach for β-linked porphyrin sensitizers. And then, among all systems, dye GD2-N2 would perform more efficiently than the others according to the calculated key parameters (ΔGinject, LHE, and nc). Hence, GD2-N2 is the most favourable one, namely the structure with substituent and adsorption groups on two different sides is the more effective configuration. Lastly, from a theoretical point of view, it can be concluded that the performance of β-linked porphyrin sensitizer may be improved after the porphyrin is asymmetrically modified by the electron-donating group, which led to the decreased HOMO–LUMO gap, a complete intra-molecular charge transfer as well as the faster electron injection process. Meanwhile, as a result of the absorption properties, it has been demonstrated that these dyes can red-shift the corresponding spectra and expand the absorption range. More importantly, compared with the symmetric porphyrin dyes, the overall electron donating ability of the asymmetric porphyrin ring is stronger. These changes would result in a bigger Jsc and Voc as well as superior cell performance. These results should be beneficial to establish the relationship between molecular structure and efficiency and to deepen the understanding of the operation mechanism of DSSCs in detail.
