    , Accepted 21st April 2015First published on 21st April 2015AbstractWe developed a cost-effective spiro-type 4,4′,4′′,4′′′\-(2H,2′H,4H,4′H-3,3′-spiro-bi[thieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxepine]-6,6′,8,8′-tetrayl)tetrakis(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline) hole transporting material (PST1) for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) that works efficiently even without a cobalt dopant. The PST1 is obtained by employing facile synthetic routes and tends to crystallize in the solid state. An X-ray diffraction study of PST1 revealed a unique quasi-spiro molecular configuration and found multiple CH/π and π–π intermolecular contacts. For the first time, the crystal structure of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N′-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) is also studied for comparison. The device based on PST1 exhibited a PCE of 13.44%, and a comparable 12.74% PCE was achieved for its undoped form, which paves the way for developing new low cost hole transporting materials and final industrialization of perovskite solar cells.
Solar energy is a gifted source of renewable energy to meet the energy and environmental crisis in the near future. Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) is believed to be a promising and low cost technology to harvest solar energy and convert it into electricity.1–3 In these cells, sensitizers are the materials used for harvesting solar radiation and are the major components in determining the efficiency of solar cells. The widely used light harvesting materials are organic dyes, inorganic complexes, quantum dots, etc.4 Recently, light absorbers based on lead halide perovskite materials exhibit broad absorption in the solar spectrum and excellent charge carrier mobility making them all-round players in so called perovskite solar cells (PSCs).5–8 The long-term stability of DSSCs and PSCs focuses on the complete solid state device in which the p-type solid state hole transporting materials (HTMs) is applied.9–12 PSC devices based on the state-of-the-art spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. 1c) as hole transporting materials have shown tremendous advancement in energy conversion efficiency starting from 3.8% to reaching 20.1% to date.7,13–21 The improvement in the efficiencies of PSCs mainly relies on optimizing various device fabricating methods, elaborate engineering of perovskite morphology and composition.18,22,23 Recently, to further decrease the cost of the perovskite solar cell and facilitate the large scale application of the new technology, efforts have been made to replace the commonly used spiro-OMeTAD HTM due to its complicated synthesis and purification steps.24–26 In this light, several new types of HTMs based on small organic molecules, polymers and inorganic salts providing reasonable efficiencies have been reported.12,27–39 Among the different types of HTMs, small molecules hold advantages over polymer materials due to their easy and convenient synthesis that is compatible for large scale manufacturing, high purity with good yield, easy characterisation of molecular structure with definite molecular weight, and ease of infiltration into the nanostructured materials.38,40 However, molecular HTM candidates that can compete with commercial spiro-OMeTAD are rare. Recently Seok et al. have modified the spiro-OMeTAD by changing the position of methoxy substituents and achieved a record efficiency of 16.7%, which infers the potential advantage of spiro-type molecules over other small molecules.41 In this context, developing new spiro-type molecules with easy and convenient synthetic methods is a great challenge, which will overcome cost factors for large scale applications of solid state solar cells. Based on this premise, in this communication, we report a new class of spiro-type hole transporting material afforded by facile synthetic steps. Photophysical and electrochemical characterizations, and X-ray crystallography of PST1 are running in parallel with that of spiro-OMeTAD. By employing this new molecule as the HTM, the champion PSC device achieved 13.44% PCE in the presence of a p-type dopant. More importantly, the p-type dopant free devices with the new HTM achieved a slightly lower PCE of 12.7%, which is commensurate with the performance of spiro-OMeTAD in the presence of a dopant.

(Hydrogen atoms omitted for clarity.) 
The chemical structure of PST1 is displayed in Fig. 2a and the synthetic route is given in the ESI.† Synthesis of PST1 starts with the reaction of 3,4-dimethoxythiophene with pentaerythritol to form spiro-bipropylenedioxythiophene as the spiro-type core, which undergoes bromination reaction with NBS to form the tetrabrominated intermediate (BTS). Following a four-fold Suzuki reaction between BTS and boronic acid pinacol ester of bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline (OMT-BPin), the final product PST1 is achieved with 60% yield.
 Fig. 2  (a) View down the b axis of the stacking molecules of PST1; (b) dashed red lines illustrate CH/π hydrogen bonds and π–π short contacts observed in the crystal of PST1 (ca. 2.8 Å and 3.25 Å). (c) View down the b axis of a unit cell of spiro-OMeTAD; (d) dashed red lines illustrate π–π short contacts (ca. 3.39 Å and 3.09 Å). 
As shown in Fig. 1b, X-ray diffraction analysis unambiguously clarified the structure of PST1. The tetrahedral sp3 hybridized carbon in between the two propylenedioxythiophenes adopts a spiro conformation. However, the two seven-membered alkylenedioxy rings are large enough to smooth away the distortion. Therefore, although the four carbon atoms directly connecting to the spiro carbon do not lie in a plane, the two thiophene rings and four oxygen atoms are almost coplanar. This is completely different from the spiro-OMeTAD, which shows an absolutely non-coplanar spiro structure due to the two orthogonally interconnected fluorenes (Fig. 1d). At the four ends of both molecules, the propeller-shaped MeO-triphenylamine (MeO-TPA) derivatives give the same types of distortion. The measured dihedral angle between the two thiophene rings in the core of PST1 is merely 7° compared to 89.94° between the two fluorene planes in spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. S1, ESI†). The quasi-planar core of PST1 will induce stronger intermolecular interaction than that of spiro-OMeTAD, which normally presents as an amorphous solid.
PST1 was found to crystallize in the monoclinic space group Cc. In the crystal lattice, the PST1 molecules form alternately inter-embedded columns along the b axis, with four OMe–TPA moieties as redox centres from one molecule overlapped with another eight OMe–TPA counterparts from four molecules of two adjacent columns (Fig. 2a). When observing the crystal perpendicular to the bc plane, CH/π hydrogen bonds and π–π short contacts were observed between the OMe–TPA moieties and with thiophene rings of nearby molecules. The mean interaction distances of 2.8 Å and 3.25 Å are measured for CH/π interaction and π–π interaction respectively (Fig. 2b). In contrast, spiro-OMeTAD crystallizes in the triclinic space group P, of which the crystal packings are also shown in Fig. 2. There are two independent molecules in one unit cell. Due to the highly non-coplanar molecular geometry, the two molecules are well separated and no direct short contacts are measured between them. To fill the space, solvent molecules are therefore inserted, which bind them together via CH/π hydrogen bonds (Fig. 2c). Although there are no contacts between the two molecules in one unit cell, each of the two molecules has multiple short contacts with molecules from surrounding unit cells including CH/π hydrogen bonds, oxygen–carbon and π–π short contacts (Fig. S2, ESI†). The shortest π–π contact between two fluorene planes is measured to be 3.09 Å, which is exceptionally close given the fact that there is almost no π overlap between the two fluorene structures (Fig. 2d). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the crystal structure and packing of spiro-OMeTAD, which is nowadays the star molecule in perovskite photovoltaic community. In both HTM crystals, the abundance of short contacts provides ample channels for charge transport among the HTM molecules.
The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of PST1 in dichloromethane (DCM) is depicted in Fig. 3a. PST1 shows two absorption bands in the UV region at 300 and 396 nm, which is red shifted by 25 nm compared to the absorption band edge of spiro-OMeTAD. In Fig. 1a, the absorption spectrum of PST1 in the thin film state is also displayed, the maximum absorption of which is red shifted by 38 nm compared to the solution state due to the presence of intermolecular π–π stacking. However there is no change in the absorbance of spiro-OMeTAD in the solid state compared to that of its solvated state as observed in the literature indicating the complete amorphous characteristic of spiro-OMeTAD.26

Earlier reports emphasized that in the presence of p-type dopants such as the Co(III) complex, spiro-OMeTAD reduces the Co(III) to Co(II) and itself is simultaneously oxidized to form spiro-OMeTAD˙+, which can be detected by the formation of new absorption peaks in the visible region.42 In a similar way, we analysed the absorption changes of PST1 in the presence of a p-type dopant (tris[2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine]cobalt(III) tris(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide)), FK209. Fig. 3b shows the UV/vis absorption of PST1 in the absence and presence of various concentrations of dopants. Upon increasing the percentage of the dopant, the absorption band of PST1 at 396 nm decreased with the formation of two new absorption bands at around 590 and 640 nm in the visible region, which correspond to the mono-cation radical of PST1. The formation of the cation radical reveals the effective doping of PST1 by FK209, which is believed to create additional charge carriers (holes) leading to an increased charge carrier density.
Cyclic voltammetric measurements were carried out to analyse and compare the energy levels of the new HTM with spiro-OMeTAD for the favourable hole injection process from the perovskite layer. For better comparison of energy levels of PST1 with spiro-OMeTAD, we have measured the cyclic voltammograms of both the HTMs under the same conditions with ferrocene as an internal standard and displayed in Fig. 4. PST1 exhibits two reversible oxidation peaks indicating their electrochemical stability. The HOMO value of PST1 is calculated to be −5.15 eV, which is slightly lower than that of spiro-OMeTAD (−5.07 eV)43 and more positive than the perovskite revealing the favourable hole transfer from the perovskite to the PST1 (Fig. 5). It is worth noting that the HOMO of PST1 is 80 mV lower than that of spiro-OMeTAD, which may assist in gaining higher open circuit potential of the devices. Fig. S3 (ESI†) displays the thermal behaviour of the PST1 measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The DSC trace shows that replacing the spiro-bifluorene linkage of spiro-OMeTAD43 with spiro-bipropylenedioxythiophene groups (PST1) substantially increases the Tg and Tm to 175 °C and 280 °C, respectively (Table 1). This is in agreement with the crystallography study, which disclosed a partial coplanar structure and multiple close interactions between the molecules of PST1.

The photovoltaic performance of the perovskite solar cell by employing PST1 as HTM is analysed by J–V and IPCE measurements. The solar cells were fabricated comprising FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/PST1/Au in the presence of LiTFSI and tBP as additives and with FK209 as the dopant in the HTM layer. Fig. 6 displays the cross sectional image of a typical perovskite solar cell analysed through a high resolution scanning electron microscope (HRSEM). The optimized device can be seen to be clearly composed of a 450 nm thick dense and mesoporous TiO2 layer infiltrated with perovskite on FTO, a 210 nm PST1 layer, and an 80 nm thermally evaporated Au layer as the back contact.

For comparison, the photovoltaic measurement of perovskite solar cells fabricated with the commercial spiro-OMeTAD as HTM was also performed under similar conditions. Fig. 7a displays the current–voltage curves of perovskite solar cells utilizing PST1 as HTM and the average photovoltaic parameters measured under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination at an intensity of ∼100 mW cm−2 are summarized in Table 2. The device with PST1 shows a JSC of 17.63 mA cm−2 with an open circuit potential (VOC) of 1.02 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.73 and results in an overall power conversion efficiency of 13.44%. Under similar conditions, the device with spiro-OMeTAD as HTM produces a comparable PCE of 12.16%. A higher VOC of the PST1 based device is responsible for the slightly higher PCE than that of the spiro-OMeTAD based device, which can be related to the difference in their HOMO energy levels and proves again the possibility of VOC modulation by choosing HTMs with appropriate HOMO levels. Fig. S4 (ESI†) shows the incident to photocurrent conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the perovskite device employing PST1 as hole transporting material. It can be seen clearly that the device with PST1 has excellent PCE above 60% from the UV region to 800 nm. These results suggest that this new spiro-type molecule can be potential substituents for commercial spiro-OMeTAD in high performance PSCs.

Motivated by the idea of further reducing the fabrication cost, we continued to fabricate the devices by removing the p-type dopant from both PST1 and spiro-OMeTAD based HTM layers. The corresponding J–V curves are displayed in Fig. 7b and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. Interestingly, after removing the dopant from PST1, the JSC increased by 1.6 mA, while the VOC dropped by 87 mV with a FF of 0.695 leading to a comparable overall efficiency of 12.74% to the undoped devices. Under similar conditions, however, for spiro-OMeTAD based devices, VOC and FF dropped significantly and resulted in a PCE of 9.7%. This observation is in line with our earlier reports indicating the poor performance of spiro-OMeTAD in the absence of a p-type dopant.27 It is worth noting that from the same batch of devices, the loss in the FF of dopant-free PST1-based devices is much less giving a comparable FF to that of doped spiro-OMeTAD. This result demonstrates that an effective molecular stacking is essential to facilitate the transport of the charges as seen from the crystal data of both HTMs and reduce the dependence on various dopants. The stability of device performance was investigated when the devices (with two different types of HTM layers) were stored under ambient conditions without any type of encapsulation. Both sets of devices started to degrade after four days under these conditions, and the average performance of the PST-based cells was slightly higher than that of the spiro-OMeTAD-based devices within the period of evaluation (Fig. S8, ESI†). The more compact crystalline nature of PST1 is supposed to be able to protect the perovskite layer better than spiro-OMeTAD.
In summary, we have designed and successfully prepared a new spiro-type hole transporting material, 4,4′,4′′,4′′′\-(2H,2′H,4H,4′H-3,3′-spiro-bi[thieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxepine]-6,6′,8,8′-tetrayl)tetrakis(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline) (PST1), via a facile synthetic route. Then the titled new compound was fully characterized and tested as hole transporting material for perovskite based solar cells. A parallel X-ray crystallography study of the single crystals of PST1 and spiro-OMeTAD indicated completely different types of spiro configuration and found multiple CH/π, O–C and π–π intermolecular short contacts. This is the first report on the crystal structure of spiro-OMeTAD to show that a dopant is essential due to the lack of π–π intermolecular stacking. The perovskite solar cell employing PST1 as the HTM layer exhibited an overall conversion efficiency of 13.44%, which is comparable with that obtained using the spiro-OMeTAD under the same fabrication conditions. This can be partially attributed to the increased VOC with PST1 as the HTM layer, which has a lower HOMO level than that of spiro-OMeTAD. Only a marginal decrease in the PCE was observed when the cobalt dopant is removed from PST1 leading to a PCE of 12.7%. This is remarkable in contrast to the performance drop to 9.57% in the device made with spiro-OMeTAD under the same conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on a new spiro-type molecule for efficient perovskite solar cells. The evaluation of device stability with PST1 based perovskite solar cells signifies that this material will emerge as a potential HTM candidate for solid state photovoltaic applications. Molecular engineering of this spiro core to further improve energy conversion efficiencies is currently under investigation in our laboratory.
