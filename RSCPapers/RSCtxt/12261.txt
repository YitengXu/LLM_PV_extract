    , Accepted 16th July 2020First published on 16th July 2020AbstractIn this work, we report the fabrication of continuous transparent and flexible supercapacitors by depositing a CNT network onto a polymer electrolyte membrane directly from an aerogel of ultra-long CNTs produced floating in the gas phase. The supercapacitors show a combination of a power density of 1370 kW kg−1 at high transmittance (ca. 70%), and high electrochemical stability during extended cycling (>94% capacitance retention over 20000 cycles) and against repeated 180° flexural deformation. They represent a significant enhancement of 1–3 orders of magnitude compared to prior state-of-the-art transparent supercapacitors based on graphene, CNTs, and rGO. These features mainly arise from the exceptionally long length of CNTs, which makes the material behave as a bulk conductor instead of an aspect ratio-limited percolating network, even for electrodes with >90% transparency. The electrical and capacitive figures-of-merit for the transparent conductor are FoMe = 2.7, and FoMc = 0.46 F S−1 cm−2 respectively.
Introduction
There has been continuous interest in developing multifunctional materials for energy conversion and storage systems that are also able to exhibit additional mechanical, thermal or optical properties such as flexibility and transparency. The envisaged applications of these multifunctional materials include power supply,1 displays,2 smart windows,3,4 transistors,5 light-emitting devices,6 touch sensors7,8 and photovoltaics.9 A key class of active materials employed in these studies are nanocarbons, such as graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Their high electrochemical stability and electrical conductivity make them particularly suitable for operation in supercapacitors with high specific power, long cycling life and fast charge–discharge rate.10,11 Moreover, the ability to process graphene and CNTs as porous and mechanically stable electrodes/current collectors makes them attractive for a wide range of devices with augmented properties relative to standard monofunctional systems, such as flexible12 and structural supercapacitors13,14 and flexible solar cells.15,16 It has also been demonstrated that, when these nanocarbons are processed as thin, percolating networks, their optical absorption is dramatically reduced, which makes them suitable for various applications in transparent electronics, photonics, and optoelectronics,17–19 among others.
In the last few years, substantial efforts to use nanocarbon-based networks as active electrode materials in transparent electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) have been made. The predominant strategy is to prepare a dispersion of high purity single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT), graphene or a combination, and then deposit a thin layer onto a transparent substrate, followed by the introduction of an electrolyte and a second thin electrode layer. This procedure has led to multifunctional devices with a wide range of properties, e.g. power densities of 0.9–120 kW kg−1, energy densities of 0.9–20 W h kg−1 and optical transmittance of 50–80% at 550 nm.20–29 The upper range of these EDLCs has comparable properties to flexible, transparent supercapacitors based on pseudocapacitive conductive polymers and battery-type metal oxides, albeit with superior cyclability.30–35
The first requirement to obtain good-quality thin electrodes is achieving excellent nanocarbon dispersions. However, dispersing nanocarbons typically requires their purification, size-selection, shortening, or chemical functionalization, which not only introduces multiple processing stages, but can also reduce the figure-of-merit for transparent conductors (TCs) by transitioning from bulk to percolating behaviours.36,37 For this reason, it is crucial to explore other methods to assemble nanocarbon based transparent electrodes for ELDCs, particularly those that avoid nanocarbon dispersions. An alternative approach is the deposition of CNTs directly from the gas-phase as they are grown by floating catalyst chemical vapour deposition (CVD). This method has consistently led to superior TCs with a sheet resistance of up to 41–820 Ω cm−2 at 90% of optical transmittance, using a combination of advanced molecular control and by maintaining a low concentration of CNTs in the gas-phase (≈5 × 105 cm−3).27,28,38–43 Electrodes made up of CNT fibres produced by direct spinning of aerogels have also been successfully used in various high-power supercapacitors with high bending flexibility and toughness,12,44,45 and more recently incorporated into structural composites.13 In such a process the CNTs grown floating in the gas phase are at a much higher concentration (1 × 109 cm−3),46 thus forming a continuous network that can be directly processed as macroscopic materials.
Motivated by these results, this work reports the fabrication of highly flexible and transparent supercapacitors with ultra-high power density by directly depositing thin CNT fibre electrodes from the gas-phase onto an ionic liquid-based polymer electrolyte (PE) membrane. The simple assembling procedure involves the direct integration of a transparent CNT fibre film from a floating catalyst CVD reactor onto both sides of a PE membrane. Then, two electrical terminals are directly connected to the sandwich-like device structure followed by stacking and laminating in a transparent plastic pouch cell. The excellent electrical conductivity of the CNT fibres precludes the use of a current collector and leads to devices with high optical transparency (ca.70%), high energy density of 10 W h kg−1, and record-high power density of 1370 kW kg−1. These values represent an improvement of 1–3 orders of magnitude relative to prior state-of-the-art transparent EDLCs based on nanocarbons.
Results and discussion
Our general method to produce CNT fibre electrodes involves direct spinning of a CNT aerogel from the gas phase during the growth of CNTs by floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition (FC-CVD) (see the ESI†). At the exit of the CVD reactor, the low-density translucent CNT aerogel is wound onto a spool, which can optionally have a substrate (Fig. 1a). Conventional electrodes are built up by winding multiple single filaments over prolonged time (Fig. 1b), whereas transparent materials are produced by collecting a single aerogel filament onto transparent substrates, such as mica or a polymer sheet (Fig. 1c). In a previous work, we studied the electrochemical properties of CNT fibre electrodes in an ionic liquid electrolyte which showed that specific power (P) values scale with the reciprocal of electrode areal density (m), commonly known as mass loading (P = 3.34/m, with the power normalized by mass per unit area in mg cm−2 of the active material in both electrodes).12 This behavior reflects a linear increase in the discharge time with increasing mass loading which is common in highly conducting EDLC electrodes where capacitance is not limited by mass transport.47 Very importantly, such an analysis predicts that the utilization of single filament electrodes (m ≈ 1 μg cm−2) should result in transparent devices with power densities exceeding 1 MW kg−1.

(b) Electrode thickness is obtained by the collection of multiple aerogel layers on the same spool. (c) Single CNT aerogel filament can be deposited onto a transparent supporting substrate to make a transparent conducting electrode. 
First, we focus briefly on the electrical and optical properties of CNT fibre transparent conductors (TCs). They are produced by depositing single CNT fibre aerogel filaments onto a transparent support, as shown in Fig. 2a. The resulting material consists of a continuous porous network of bundles (Fig. 2b) comprised of highly graphitized few-layer multiwalled CNTs (Fig. 2c) with an estimated length of 1 mm.46 The areal density of these samples can be conveniently varied by overlapping more layers at the point of collection. To facilitate electrical measurements, the samples were directly deposited onto the substrates with four equidistant pre-patterned gold electrodes (see the ESI†).

Fig. 2d depicts a plot of optical transmittance (T) at 550 nm as a function of sheet resistance (Rs) for the CNT fibre sheet produced in this work (the optical transmittance spectra for 1–5 layers of the CNT fibres are shown in Fig. 1Sa, ESI†). The results show that the material is a good TC, combining high transparency and relatively low Rs reaching, for example, 462 Ohms sq−1 at 90% of transmittance. A common electrical figure of merit (FoMe) for TCs is the ratio of DC conductivity and optical conductivity (σDC/σop) shown in the following equation: (1)
Fitting the experimental values of T and Rs using eqn (1) (red dashed line) translates into a FoMe of 2.7. This value is similar to those reported for related floating catalyst (FC)-CVD processes in the absence of dopants,42,48–51 and comparable to those of transparent nanocarbon electrodes based on wet-processed SWCNTs,52,53 graphene,54,55 rGO56,57 and their hybrids58–60 (see Fig. 1Sb and Table 1s, ESI†). The plot of (T(−0.5) − 1) as a function of Rs in Fig. 2e confirms that the CNT fibres demonstrate bulk-like conductive behavior in the whole optical transmittance range. Unlike in other nanostructured transparent conductor electrodes of small aspect ratio conductors,36,37 reducing the CNT fibre thickness does not lead to a transition below the percolating regime. The extraordinarily high aspect ratio (106) of the constituent CNTs in this process implies that the transition from bulk to percolation behavior is below the thickness practically attainable in an electrode using this preparation method. In addition, note that the actual fibre drawing process requires mechanical percolation in the material to sustain the associated stress when the fibre is withdrawn from the reactor,61 thus implying that the samples produced continuously are inherently in the bulk regime.
Fitting the equation in Fig. 2e and assuming an optical conductivity of 2.0 × 104 S m−1,62,63 resulted in a DC conductivity of 5.4 × 104 S m−1, which is in the range of longitudinal conductivities measured for similar CNT fibre materials and higher than those of high-quality solution-processed CNT networks at 3 × 104 S m−1.37 A small degree of CNT alignment might contribute to such high values of conductivity, but in general the requirement of transparency implies that the network is largely misoriented (Fig. 2b). In this FC-CVD process the conducting network morphology is reminiscent of the aerogel structure. However, although the aerogel volumetric density can be controlled by adjusting the gas flow rate in the reactor or the spinning/winding rate, this mainly affects the areal density of the TC but not its FoMe (see Fig. 2S, ESI†).64 These properties, combined with the high specific surface area (∼250 m2 g−1) and mesoporous structure of the bulk CNT fibre,65 make the transparent CNT fibre electrodes a promising material for application in EDLCs. As a consequence of CNT aggregation, necessary to form a conducting percolating network, the specific surface area is lower than theoretical values for individualised CNTs,66 but nevertheless much higher than those for metallic conductors.
The electrochemical properties of the single filament CNT fibre were evaluated by assembling a symmetric coin-shaped EDLC device. A flexible polymer electrolyte membrane, consisting of 70 wt% of N-methyl-N-butylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Pyr14TFSI) ionic liquid and 30 wt% of poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-co-HFP) polymer, was used as a separator and electrolyte source. The mass loading of the CNT fibre was 1.75 ± 0.05 μg cm−2, determined from several measurements of fibre's gravimetric linear density (see the ESI†). Accordingly, the total mass loading of the active material in the whole device was 3.50 ± 0.05 μg cm−2.
The results of galvanostatic charge–discharge (CD) tests at different current densities in a two-electrode Swagelok cell are presented in Fig. 3. A comparison of the CD profiles of the EDLC devices based on single-filament CNT electrodes (3.5 μg cm−2) and conventional high mass loading CNT fibres (1.27 mg cm−2) is shown in Fig. 3a. The triangular shape of the charge–discharge capacity with a constant slope along the whole dis(charge) voltage undoubtedly demonstrates the electrostatic nature of the charge storing mechanism. In Fig. 3a both curves show a similar triangular shape with high coulombic efficiencies (μ = Qdicharge/Qcharge = (Id × td)/(Ic × tc)) (>95%), demonstrating the reversible capacitive behavior of both devices. Notably, similar values of the ohmic drop indicate the negligible influence of electrode's thickness on the equivalent series resistance (ESR) of EDLCs. Moreover, the ESR is in the range of values reported for similar electrochemical systems,12 and it does not substantially vary at different currents applied (see Fig. 3S, ESI†). Moreover, the discharge profiles in Fig. 3a show fairly similar slopes which indicates that the thickness of the electrode does not significantly affect the specific capacitance (C ∼ 1/slope) of the devices. In fact, the specific capacitances of the single filament EDLC are slightly higher than those for the high mass loading EDLC in the whole range of current densities (Fig. 3b), achieving maximum values of 31.2 and 27.5 F g−1 at 1 mA cm−2, respectively. This small difference can be attributed to the more effective impregnation of the polymer electrolyte into the ultrathin film of the single filament electrode maximizing the material utilization.

(d) Real energy and power densities of symmetric supercapacitors at different total mass loadings of CNT fibres, calculated from the CD measurements performed at 3.5 V operating voltage and 5 mA cm−2 current density. 
For reference, specific energy (Ereal) and power (Preal) values were calculated from the discharge profiles and compared in a Ragone plot as shown in Fig. 3c. The maximum value of Ereal achieved at 1 mA cm−2 for the single filament EDLC was 12.3 W h kg−1 (84.6 nW h cm−2), while Preal reached the highest value of 1579 kW kg−1 at 10 mA cm−2 corresponding to an areal power density of 10.86 mW cm−2. Remarkably, the value of specific power at 5 mA cm−2 was found to be still ∼1.0 MW kg−1.
To further investigate the effect of electrode thickness on the electrochemical performance, the specific power of the samples with a fixed area but different electrode mass loadings (i.e. thickness) ranging from 3.5 μg cm−2 to 2.40 mg cm−2 was compared. The plots of real energy and power densities against the reciprocal of electrode mass loading (considering the active mass of the two electrodes), are presented in Fig. 3d. As anticipated, the specific energy remains nearly constant, whereas the power density shows a linear dependence on the inverse of mass loading (1/m). This confirms that the CNT fibre electrodes behave as a bulk conductive material in the EDLC device, which is a key feature enabling to achieve extremely high power densities.
With these results in mind, we explored the behavior of free-standing transparent EDLC devices composed of CNT fibre electrodes and the polymer electrolyte encapsulated in a transparent plastic pouch cell. The high electrical conductivity of the CNT fibre associated with its unique structure enables its dual role as an active material and current collector, using a conducing frame made with simple aluminum foil for external connections (Fig. 4a). The optical transmittance values of the device and its individual components (the PE membrane and single filament CNT electrodes) are depicted in Fig. 4b. The high transmittance of the PE membrane (98%) and of each single filament CNT fibre (∼90%) leads to a device with ca. 70% optical transmittance at a wavelength of 550 nm.

The charge–discharge profiles obtained for a flexible and transparent free-standing EDLC compared with those of a similar EDLC assembled in a typical Swagelok cell are included in Fig. 4c. This comparison is relevant since the results obtained in two-electrode Swagelok or coin cells are often considered to represent the upper limit of the devices. The maximum values of real power and energy densities for the transparent free-standing device are as high as 1370 kW kg−1 and 10 W h kg−1, respectively, with a specific capacitance (Cs) of 29 F g−1. These values only differ slightly from those obtained using the Swagelok cell configuration mainly due to the larger equivalent series resistance (ESR) (50 Ohms vs. 40 Ohms) exhibited by the transparent free-standing device. The higher ESR was also corroborated by EIS measurements showing a larger semicircle at high frequencies observed in the Nyquist plot of the transparent device (Fig. 4d). We attribute this difference to the higher pressure and resultant better compaction of the EDLC sandwich structure in the Swagelok cell producing improved electrical contact between the electrodes and current collector. The maximum energy (Emax = CV2/2) and power (Pmax = V2/(4 × ESR)) densities were also calculated for comparative purposes and were found to be 12.3 W h kg−1 and 7290 kW kg−1, respectively.
To compare the capacitive performance of the transparent CNT fibre films with the literature data, we have calculated the capacitive figure of merit (FoMc = CV/σop) using the following equation: (2)
Here CV and CA are the volumetric and areal capacitances, respectively. Since the gravimetric capacitance was found to be independent of the CNT fibre mass loading (see Fig. 3) and considering a value of Cs = 78 F g−1 per electrode,65 the FoMc value for the single CNT fibre layer (1.75 μg cm−2) corresponds to 0.46 F S−1 cm−2. This value is higher than those reported previously for transparent electrodes based on SWCNTs (0.32 F S−1 cm−2), confirming the excellent multifunctional properties of the single-filament CNT fibre electrodes.37
The as-fabricated free-standing transparent EDLC device was subjected to 20000 charge–discharge cycles in a voltage window of 3.5 V at 5 mA cm−2 to study its long-term cycling performance. The values of specific capacitance and energy density were not significantly affected during cycling. Fig. 5a shows that the capacitance retention after cycling was nearly 94%, with a drop in the energy density of less than 4% after 20000 cycles and the coulombic efficiency values remained constant at ∼99% as depicted in Fig. 4S† confirming the excellent long-term electrochemical performance of the system. These results are particularly relevant considering the high voltage used during charging, and the fact that the nominal 5 mA cm−2 current density applied corresponds to a very high effective in-plane current density when normalized by the CNT fibre cross sectional area (∼1.1 × 107 Am−2).

To explore the potential application of the assembled device in flexible electronics, we have additionally studied the electrochemical performance of the transparent EDLC under flexural stress by subjecting it to 100 cycles of 180° bending. As shown in Fig. 5b, the CD profiles before and after bending have identical line shapes, indicating that the repeated bending of the EDLC does not induce any deterioration in its electrochemical performance. Such robustness results from the intrinsic toughness of the CNT fibre electrodes and the formation of a large ductile interface upon infiltration of the PE.

Fig. 6 shows the performance of the transparent and flexible supercapacitors reported in the literature (cross-sectional plots included in the ESI, Fig. (5S).† Most of the studies report Emax and Pmax, which can be significantly obtained from the realistic available energy and power of a system. However, the lack of real energy and power values in the literature leads to the necessity of representing Emax and Pmax for the accurate comparison of the performances. A transparent and flexible device based on single layer CNT fibre electrodes and an IL-based PE exhibits good transmittance combined with outstanding electrochemical properties which are among the highest values reported for state-of-the-art devices. In fact, the power density of the EDLC based on CNT fibre sheets is substantially higher than those of previously reported transparent supercapacitors based on graphene,20,23,29 CNTs,24,25,27 and rGO21 by 1 to 4 orders of magnitude, while also showing large energy density. It is worth mentioning that even the real available specific power of our transparent EDLC significantly surpasses Pmax values from previous studies. Interestingly, comparison with the literature also reveals orders-of-magnitude larger current densities achieved for the present CNT fibre-based EDLC (10−3–10−2 A cm−2vs. 10−7–10−4 A cm−2) leading to much faster discharge rates (tdis < 0.2 s vs. 10–100 s). This additionally indicates the exceptional conductive performance of the thin CNT fibre films. Therefore, the combination of good optical transparency, high flexibility, and excellent energy storage capabilities makes the EDLC based on CNT fibres and a PE membrane a highly promising multifunctional energy storage system.

Conclusions
In summary, we have produced a multifunctional transparent and flexible EDLC based on a polymer electrolyte and ultra-thin transparent electrodes of CNT fibres directly drawn as an aerogel from the gas-phase during CNT growth. When used as a transparent conductor, the interconnected network of CNTs in the as-spun fibres shows a FoMe of 2.7, reaching for example 566 Ohm sq−1Rs at 90% transparency. These properties stem from the exceptionally long length of the constituent CNTs, making the electrodes behave as bulk conductors, thus showing both higher conductivity and transparency compared to solution-processed percolating networks of CNTs. The FoMe seems to be fixed for a given CNT fibre composition, with changes in the aerogel morphology affecting simply the areal density. In view of these results, work is in progress to study the effect of CNT types and bundle dimensions as routes for further performance improvement.
Flexible and transparent supercapacitor devices were found to exhibit an optimal transmittance of ca. −70% in combination with an outstanding electrochemical performance including a power density of 1370 kW kg−1, the largest value achieved in the transparent EDLC configuration. A linear dependence of power density on 1/electrode mass loading was obtained experimentally for these devices. This confirms the efficiency of the assembly process, while also reflecting the highly conductive nature of the CNT fibre electrodes. The transparent EDLC device also shows excellent cycling stability over 20000 cycles at 3.5 V with no changes in the electrochemical performance after 100 bending cycles at 180°.
The current capacitive figure of merit for the CNT fibre film is 0.46 F S−1 cm−2, which is among the highest FOMc values for pristine nanocarbon electrodes. This is compensated by the extreme simplicity of the synthesis process used here. Based on previous experience in fibre spinning and fabrication of large-area all-solid supercapacitors, we envisage that transparent supercapacitors based on CNT fibres could be produced continuously at rates as high as 100 m min−1. More importantly, further improvements in capacitance by introducing pseudocapacitive reactions can be easily achieved.

 	Fig. 1  (a) Schematic of the fabrication of electrodes by the collection of a CNT aerogel directly from the gas-phase during growth by floating catalyst chemical vapour deposition. (b) Electrode thickness is obtained by the collection of multiple aerogel layers on the same spool. (c) Single CNT aerogel filament can be deposited onto a transparent supporting substrate to make a transparent conducting electrode.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Photograph of a single layer of CNT fibre, (b) SEM and (c) TEM images demonstrating the morphology and microstructure of the CNT network and its highly graphitic structure. (d) The plot of transmittance at 550 nm as a function of sheet resistance and (e) the corresponding plot of T(−0.5) − 1 as a function of Rs, following nearly linear dependence and confirming the bulk-like conductive behaviour of the CNT fibres in all the ranges of transmittance.	 
	(1)

 	Fig. 3  Comparison of single-filament (3.5 μg cm−2) and high mass loading (1.27 mg cm−2) CNT fibre-based EDLCs: (a) CD profiles obtained at 5 mA cm−2, (b) specific capacitance (Cs) at different current densities and (c) Ragone plots. (d) Real energy and power densities of symmetric supercapacitors at different total mass loadings of CNT fibres, calculated from the CD measurements performed at 3.5 V operating voltage and 5 mA cm−2 current density.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Photograph of the free-standing transparent EDLC device, (b) optical transmittance of the CNT fibre/PE/CNT fibre composite, PE membrane and single layer of the CNT fibre, (c) CD profiles at 2 mA cm−2 and (d) Nyquist plots on comparing the performance of single-filament (3.5 μg cm−2) CNT fibre-based EDLCs assembled in a Swagelok cell and laminated into a transparent free-standing flexible device.
