    , Accepted 7th June 2020First published on 8th June 2020AbstractMonodisperse AgPd nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized and studied as an efficient catalyst for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction by modulating bimetallic compositions. The mechanistic studies, based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations and environmental diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) analysis, revealed that the incorporation of Ag in AgPd NPs can effectively weaken CO adsorption on all possible Pd surface sites (the ligand effects), and more importantly, disrupt the strongest multi-centered CO-binding sites (the ensemble effects). With properly tuned CO adsorption, which is ordinarily too strong over pure Pd, Ag15Pd85 NPs were found to be the best composition for the efficient production of CO. They deliver a unity conversion of CO2 to CO with a high mass activity of 15.2 mA mgmetal−1 at −0.8 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and high stability with minimal change in the CO faradaic efficiency (FECO) after 12 hours of operation.
Introduction
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) offers the possibility of carbon-neutral production of chemicals and fuels when driven by renewable electricity (solar, wind and hydro etc.).1–3 CO is one of the targeted eCO2RR products with broad interest, as it is an essential precursor in many industrial processes, including the water–gas shift reaction for hydrogen production as well as the chemical synthesis of methanol, acetic acid, aldehydes etc.1,4 Thermodynamically, the eCO2RR to CO takes place at −0.52 V vs. the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE).5,6 However, due to the sluggish kinetics and multi-step proton and electron transfers, the reaction usually requires large overpotentials to yield a desirable production rate of CO.7,8
Among the various metal catalysts studied for the eCO2RR, Pd has shown an impressive faradaic efficiency towards CO (FECO) at relatively low overpotentials.9 This is primarily caused by the strong binding energy of C-bound intermediates (including *CO, *COOH etc. that are correlated through a scaling relationship) on the surface of Pd, facilitating CO2 activation and suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).10,11 But this feature makes Pd prone to CO-poisoning,12 which hampers the CO desorption step and decreases the CO production rate.13 A great deal of effort has been devoted to balancing the binding energy of C-bound intermediates for improved efficiency by tuning the size and surface structure of Pd nanoparticles (NPs). For example, Gao et al. investigated the size effect of Pd NPs (from 2.4 to 10.3 nm) and demonstrated that a 91.2% FECO can be reached on 3.7 nm Pd.14 Pd concave nanocubes with high index {310} surface facets were found to be more efficient than Pd nano-octahedra and nanocubes, leading to a FECO of 90.6%.15 Despite the encouraging progress, the issue of low CO current density (production rate) associated with over-strong CO adsorption over Pd NPs needs to be further addressed.
Alloying Pd with a second element, M, has been studied to lower the CO adsorption strength and enhance the CO production rate. Yin et al. reported that CuPd alloy NPs can exhibit a significantly improved CO mass current density.16 Yet the FECO dropped down to 86% because of the promoted HER at the Cu sites. Such a M-induced product selectivity alteration was also observed on other MPd alloy NPs (such as NiPd,17 SnPd18etc.). In this article, we specifically studied AgPd NPs with a uniform size of 2–4 nm and controllable AgPd bimetallic compositions to elucidate the composition-dependent catalytic properties for the eCO2RR. Ag is a known metal with weak binding to both *CO and *H.10 We anticipate that the incorporation of Ag into Pd can alleviate CO-poisoning without sacrificing the FECO. A similar concept was employed to construct Pd small clusters on the surface of Au NPs,19 but the use of Ag in the present work, which is a more earth-abundant element, benefits from the ease of synthesizing atomically precise AgPd NPs as well as the higher catalytic enhancing effect. By systematically studying AgPd NPs with a wide range of well-controlled compositions, Ag15Pd85 is identified as the most efficient with a FEco at 100% and a high CO current density of 15.2 mA mgmetal−1 at −0.8 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). With the assistance of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and environmental diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) analysis, we further demonstrate that the bimetallic enhancement arises from a combination of ligand and ensemble effects that is properly adjusted by the favourable Ag level. The former weakens the CO adsorption on all possible Pd sites, while the latter disrupts the strongest multi-fold CO binding sites.
Experimental
Chemicals and materials
Palladium(II) acetylacetonate (Pd(acac)2, >99%), silver(I) acetate (Ag(ac), 99%), oleic acid (OAc, 90%), oleylamine (OAm, 70%), and Nafion (5 wt% in lower aliphatic alcohols and water) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 1-Octadecene (ODE, 90%) was purchased from Acros Organics. Hydrazine monohydrate (>99%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Isopropanol (99.5%) and hexanes (98.5%) were purchased from Fisher Scientific. Vulcan-XC 72R carbon black was obtained from Fuel Cell Store. All chemicals and materials were used as received without further purification.
Synthesis of AgPd, Ag, and Pd NPs
All AgPd NPs with different bimetallic compositions were synthesized via an organic-phase colloidal approach, according to our previous report.20 In a typical synthesis of Ag15Pd85 NPs, 244 mg of Pd(acac)2 (0.8 mmol) and 34 mg of Ag(ac) (0.2 mmol) were mixed together with 4.5 ml of OAc, 0.5 ml of OAm, and 10 ml of ODE. The mixture was kept at 60 °C under a N2 atmosphere for 30 minutes to generate a transparent, dark orange solution. It was heated to 180 °C at a ramp rate of 3–5 °C min−1 and was then kept at that temperature for 20 minutes. After cooling down to room temperature, the NPs were collected by centrifugation at 8000 rpm after the addition of 45 ml of isopropanol. Then, the NPs were purified twice by centrifugation in 5 ml of hexane and 40 ml of isopropanol. The as-synthesized NPs were re-dispersed and stored in hexanes. Following the same procedure, Ag5Pd95, Ag37Pd63 and Ag45Pd55 NPs were synthesized by using 274 mg (0.9 mmol) of Pd(acac)2 together with 16.7 mg (0.1 mmol) of Ag(ac), 183 mg (0.6 mmol) of Pd(acac)2 together with 67 mg (0.4 mmol) of Ag(ac), and 152 mg (0.5 mmol) of Pd(acac)2 together with 84 mg (0.5 mmol) of Ag(ac), respectively.
For the control experiment, Ag NPs were prepared with 167 mg of Ag(ac) as the sole metal precursor following the same synthesis strategy of AgPd. We also obtained Pd NPs with a similar size according to an established method.21 100 mg of Pd(acac)2 was dissolved in 12 ml of OAm under magnetic stirring. After degassing the solution at 60 °C for 30 minutes to remove the moisture and impurities, 200 mg of TBAB that was pre-dissolved in 3 ml of OAm was injected into the reaction system. The solution was kept for 30 minutes before cooling to room temperature. The Pd NPs were collected and purified following the same procedure of AgPd NPs as detailed above.
Preparation of carbon supported NP (C-NP) catalysts
200 mg of carbon black (Vulcan XC 72R) was dispersed in 10 ml of hexanes under sonication for 15 min. 50 mg of the as-prepared NPs (dispersed in hexanes) was then added dropwise into the carbon black suspension and sonicated for 1 hour. The supported NPs were then collected by centrifugation, washed with ethanol, and dried in a vacuum oven overnight. To remove OAc and OAm surfactants attached to the NP surface, the catalyst was stirred in 10% v/v hydrazine/ethanol solution overnight, and then washed three times by centrifugation (5000 rpm, 5 minutes) with the addition of 20 ml of ethanol. The catalyst was dried under vacuum before its use.
Characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained on a FEI Tecnai Spirit (120 kV). High resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were obtained on a FEI Titan 80–300 (300 kV). Scanning TEM (STEM) analyses were carried out using a Hitachi HD2700C (200 kV) equipped with a probe aberration-corrector and an electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) detector in the Center for Functional Nanomaterials at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The 2D EELS elemental mappings were collected using a high resolution Gatan-Enfina ER with a probe size of 1.3 Å. A power law function was used for EELS background subtraction. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) analyses were conducted on a PerkinElmer Avio-200 ICP optical emission spectrometer to determine the compositions of AgPd NPs and the metal loading on the C-NP catalysts. X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization was carried out on an Empyrean Multipurpose X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out using PHI VersaProb III which is equipped with monochromatic Al K-alpha X-rays (1486.6 eV) to identify the surface composition and electronic structure of the catalysts. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was carried out to measure the adsorbed CO profiles using a Nicolet iS 50 FT-IR (Thermo Scientific, USA) equipped with a DiffusIR™ diffuse reflectance cell (Pike Technologies). After the sample was loaded into the cell, it was first purged with Ar (50 sccm) at room temperature for 1 hour, and the background was collected. Then CO (1% balanced in Ar) was introduced into the chamber and purged (25 sccm) for another 1 hour until the sample was completely saturated. The CO desorption behavior was studied by flushing the sample with Ar (25 sccm) again at designed temperatures of 303 K, 353 K, 403 K and 453 K. The ramping rate is 5 °C min−1.
Electrocatalytic analysis
The eCO2RR was investigated in 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte solution, using an Autolab Potentiostat (PGSTAT128N, Metrohm AG, Switzerland), a glassy carbon working electrode (5 mm in diameter), an Ag/AgCl electrode reference electrode, and a Pt gauze counter electrode. All potentials were reported vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the following the equation: E(vs. RHE) = E(vs. Ag/AgCl) + 0.197 + 0.0591 × pH(1)
To prepare the working electrode, 2 mg of the catalyst (∼20 wt%) was first sonicated in 200 μl of isopropanol and 5.1 μl of Nafion (5 wt%) for 1 hour to form a uniform ink. An appropriate amount of the ink was then dropcast onto a pre-polished glassy carbon electrode to yield a loading of 250 μg of carbon supported catalysts. The real metal loading on the electrode was subsequently calculated based on this number and the metal concentrations were determined by ICP-OES analysis (Table S1†). Electrocatalysis was performed in a gas-tight H-type cell with a Nafion-212 membrane assembled between the cathode and anode compartments. Each chamber was filled with 12 ml of 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed in a CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte at 20 mV s−1. To assess the product distribution, controlled potential electrolysis (CPE) was performed at selected potentials. During the electrolysis, CO2 was steadily supplied to the cathode compartment at a rate of 10 sccm, and the gas phase effluent in the headspace of the cathode compartment was continuously introduced to the sampling loop of a Shimadzu gas chromatograph (GC2014). The gaseous product stream was analysed using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID) equipped with a methanizer, using argon as the carrier gas. The liquid phase products were analysed using a Shimadzu high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) equipped with a Bio-rad Aminex HPX-87H column, a photodiode array detector (PDA), and a refractive index detector (RID), using a 5 mM H2SO4 mobile phase.
DFT calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)22 with the projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials23 and the revised Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (RPBE) exchange correlation functional.24 An energy cutoff of 450 eV was used for the plane wave basis set. The energy convergence criterion was 10−6 eV for geometry optimizations.
All adsorption energy calculations were performed on the (111) surface of the Ag, Pd, and AgPd alloy systems. The surface was modelled using a (1 × 2) supercell comprised of 4 layers and 15 Å of vacuum. The bottom layer was frozen to the bulk parameter while the top 3 layers were allowed to fully relax. A 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh25 was the chosen sampling scheme. The binding energy between CO and the surface was sampled at atop, bridge, hcp three-fold hollow, and fcc three-fold hollow sites on the pure metals and alloys and is given by the equation. Eb, CO = E(CO + slab) − E(Slab) − E(CO)(2)
The CO coverage is held at θ = 1/16. The Ag concentration was varied from 0 to 100% in 12.5% (to 25%) and then 25% intervals. The lattice parameters for each pure metal and the alloys were calculated to be 3.98 Å, 4.04 Å, 4.10 Å, 4.14 Å, and 4.22 Å from Pd to Ag, comparable favorably to previous studies after accounting for the slight increase expected with the use of the RPBE functional.24,26 Since the Pd three-fold hollow sites do not exist in the Ag50Pd50 and Ag75Pd25 (111) slab model surfaces, we generated three-fold Pd ensembles by rearranging the surface atoms but keeping the chemical composition fixed on the surface (see Fig. 5a–d and Fig. S12† for models). These generated structures were fully relaxed and served as the reference for the relevant binding energy calculations.
Results and discussion
AgPd NPs were prepared via a colloidal synthesis approach that we reported previously,20 using OAm as the reducing agent and the combination of OAc and OAm as surfactants. It is worth noting that the excessive amount of OAc is crucial to stabilize the Ag precursor from self-nucleation and avoid the formation of polydisperse AgPd NPs. The morphology of AgPd NPs was investigated using TEM, while the chemical composition of NPs was revealed through ICP-OES. As shown in the TEM images in Fig. 1, the as-synthesized Ag5Pd95, Ag15Pd85, Ag37Pd63, and Ag45Pd55 NPs are all uniform, with an average size of 4.5 ± 0.3 nm, 3.3 ± 0.4 nm, 2.8 ± 0.5 nm, and 2.3 ± 0.4 nm, respectively. We further prepared 2.4 ± 0.1 nm Ag NPs (Fig. S1a†) and 4.8 ± 0.6 nm Pd NPs (Fig. S2a†), as described in the Experimental section. They are also monodisperse NPs with a similar size as AgPd and can therefore be used in the control experiment of electrocatalysis. The use of monodisperse nanoparticles is a key enabler to unambiguously refine the composition effect in catalysis, with the minimized influence from other structural parameters.27,28 The as-synthesized NPs were deposited on Vulcan XC 72R carbon black (C-NPs) and treated with hydrazine/ethanol solution to remove OAc and OAm bulky hydrophobic surfactants. This process mediated by hydrazine ligand exchange has been widely used for activating the surface of NPs produced with bulky organic ligands for various applications.29–31 TEM analysis indicates that these NPs well preserved their size, shape and distribution on the carbon support after hydrazine treatment (Fig. S1b, S2b and S3†).

The HRTEM image in Fig. 2a shows that the AgPd NPs remain well crystalline after surfactant removal. Meanwhile, based on the STEM high angle annular dark-field (HAADF) image and the EELS 2D elemental mappings of AgPd displayed in Fig. 2b–d, we confirmed that Pd and Ag elements are homogeneously distributed in the NPs, forming a solid-solution alloy. The XRD patterns of C-NP samples are summarized in Fig. S4,† and indicate that all NPs present a typical fcc structure (Pd: PDF# 03-065-6174; Ag: PDF# 04-0783). The C-Pd displays four diffraction peaks at 40.1°, 45.5°, 68.1°, and 81.3° that are indexed to the (111), (200), (220), and (311) plane diffractions. On C-AgPd and C-Ag samples, only the (111) peak is weakly observed due to the smaller sizes of these NPs, and the peak slightly shifts to the lower angle with the increase of the Ag content, consistent with our previous report.20 The XPS spectra of AgPd in Fig. S5† displays a negative binding energy (BE) shift of the Pd 3d peak with the decrease in the Pd concentration (Table S2†). Meanwhile, the Ag 3d peak also shifted negatively. These results agree with the previous theoretical and experimental XPS studies on AgPd alloy materials, evidencing the alloy structure of our AgPd NPs.32,33

The eCO2RRs on the C-AgPd, C-Pd and C-Ag catalysts were systematically investigated using the CPE technique in the potential range of −0.6 V to −1.0 V vs. RHE. The gas-phase products were simultaneously measured using an on-line GC, while the liquid phase product information was obtained by analysing the catholyte with HPLC after the catalysis. We found that, after two hours of catalysis, both Pd and AgPd NP structures were well-maintained on the carbon support (Fig. S6 and S7a†). However, the NP agglomeration and size increase can be clearly seen on C-Ag after the catalysis testing, which may be caused by the surface redox reactivity of ultrasmall Ag NPs (Fig. S8†). Such a redox-induced small NP coalescence during eCO2RR was also found in the previous studies of Bi,7 Cu34 and Pb-based nanocatalysts.8
The eCO2RR catalytic performances of C-AgPd with different bimetallic compositions, along with those of C-Pd and C-Ag, are shown in Fig. 3. CO is found as the primary product on all catalysts, although the FECO for each catalyst presents a maximum at different potentials (Fig. 3a). On C-Pd, the maximum FECO of 83.9 ± 5.9% is obtained at −0.7 V, which is superior to the Pd electrode (<30%)35 and is comparable to that of the reported 3.7 nm Pd NPs (91.2%).14,36 With lower overpotentials, such as −0.6 V, the FECO on C-Pd drops down to 42.0 ± 3.8%. At more positive potentials (−0.4 to −0.5 V), liquid-phase formic acid is detected as the primary product without the formation of CO; however, these conditions lead to extremely low current densities (Table S3†), suggesting that a certain amount of overpotential is a necessity for *COOH splitting to *CO.37 The FECO on C-Pd also decreases at higher overpotentials, due to the limited CO2 solubility and mass transport and the increased HER rate.38,39 In contrast to Pd, the C-Ag catalyst consistently exhibits a low FECO (<35%), unless a potential as negative as −0.9 V is applied, which is ascribed to the weak CO adsorption energy on Ag.
 Fig. 3  The evaluation of eCO2 RR performance of C-AgPd, C-Pd, and C-Ag catalysts: (a) faradaic efficiency of CO (FECO), (b) CO partial current density (jCO); and (c) mass activity at −0.6 to −1.0 V. 
The FECO is substantially improved on the C-AgPd NP catalysts compared with the monometallic counterparts, and more interestingly, they present a volcano-like behaviour in association with the bimetallic composition. The C-Ag15Pd85 exhibits the highest FECO across all studied potentials. At −0.8 V and −0.9 V, the FECO on C-Ag15Pd85 reaches 100.0 ± 4.0% and 92.3 ± 2.8% respectively. Even at a low overpotential of −0.6 V, the FECO still maintains at 88.0 ± 0.5%, which is 1.2 and 3.3 times higher than that of C-Pd and C-Ag, respectively.
We also investigated the eCO2RR to CO in terms of CO partial current density (jCO), which directly quantifies the CO production rate. As shown in Fig. 3b, all catalysts show an increased CO partial current density at higher overpotentials. The C-Pd also shows a low rate at low overpotentials (∼0.2 mA cm−2 at −0.6 V), which increases to ∼3.9 mA cm−2 at −0.9 V and ∼4.8 mA cm−2 at −1.0 V. The jCO is drastically increased on C-AgPd catalysts. With the best one, C-Ag15Pd85, the jCO reaches 3.3 mA cm−2 at −0.8 V, leading to an enhancement factor of 1.8 and 8.9 compared with C-Pd and C-Ag.
The current of CO production was further normalized to the total metal mass loading of the catalyst on the electrode to yield mass activity. We found that the bimetallic catalysts clearly enhance the eCO2RR activity. Particularly on C-Ag15Pd85, the mass activity reaches 15.2 mA mg−1 at −0.8 V, indicating a 2.5- and 3.7-time enhancement compared with C-Pd and C-Ag, respectively. C-Ag15Pd85 is considered to be the best-performing catalyst for eCO2RR in all aspects in the present study and exhibits the highest FECO and mass activity.
The catalytic stability of C-AgPd was evaluated using CPE at −0.8 V for up to 12 hours. As illustrated in Fig. S9,† the FECO on the C-Ag15Pd85 is highly stable during the stability testing with minor fluctuations in the range of 95–100%. After the 12-hour test, the morphology of Ag15Pd85 NPs was re-examined under TEM (Fig. S7b†). While most of the NP structures are well-preserved, some aggregations are seen in certain areas on the support, and correspondingly, the mass activity is decreased by 12.4% (from 15.2 mA mg−1 to 13.3 mA mg−1) after the 12-hour eCO2RR (Fig. S9†). In comparison, the C-Pd catalyst shows a mass activity decay of 38.6% (from 7.0 mA mg−1 to 4.3 mA mg−1) under the same conditions (Fig. S10†), which likely results from the accumulation of CO over Pd sites,40 suggesting that bimetallic AgPd NP catalysts are more durable for long-term eCO2RR.
As we discussed above, the incorporation of Ag in the AgPd alloy NPs is expected to alleviate the CO-poisoning issue of Pd by weakening the CO adsorption energy on the surface. In principle, such alloy-induced surface energetics change can be possibly rationalized by two effects: ligand and ensemble effects.41,42 The ligand effect is described as the change in the chemical properties (chemical state, electronic structure, etc.) of the surface atoms due to alloying. The ensemble effect results from the change in the adsorption and catalytic properties of the surface atom ensembles. Using CO as a probe adsorbate in both experiment and computation, we further studied the surface Pd interaction mode and strength with CO in bimetallic and monometallic catalysts with an objective to understand these two effects.
DRIFTS was used to reveal the CO binding configuration and strength with Pd surface atoms, considering that CO is a strong adsorbate with unified interaction with Pd under both gas and solvation conditions. To obtain an optimized IR quality, the AgPd NPs and Pd NPs were loaded onto alumina (Al2O3) instead of carbon black (1 wt% metal loading). The Ag NPs are not included here due to their weak adsorption of CO under ambient conditions. The obtained peak positions and their spectroscopic assignments are listed in Table S4.† The stretching frequency of CO on Pd NPs results in several peaks: one peak between 1820 and 1950 cm−1 is correlated with multi-centered *CO on threefold hollow and bridge sites, while the linear *CO on the atop site usually gives rise to a band at around 2076 cm−1.43,44 The former peak is very broad due to the existence of both bridge sites and threefold hollow sites on Pd NPs, which are dominant on the Pd catalyst.
A series of IR spectra on three AgPd samples with different compositions were recorded under the same conditions (Fig. 4a). It is clearly seen that the relative intensity of different *CO species changes dramatically with the Ag content. The concentration of multi-centered *CO shows a clear-cut and significant drop on Ag15Pd85. The drop becomes more intense on the other two samples with a higher Ag content, while the linear *CO dominates on the surface of Ag45Pd55 NPs. The multi-centered *CO intensity decrease is ascribed to the dilution effect of Ag, in which Ag, even at a low concentration (15%), can effectively disrupt the Pd ensembles on the surface of NPs. In addition, another feature we have noticed is the change in peak positions. As more Pd atoms diluted by Ag are present on the surface, CO coupling between adjacent sites is extenuated, shifting the CO peaks to a lower wavenumber.45–47 Such Ag-dilution caused CO peak shifting was also reported in other studies.46,48

(b–d) TPD-DRIFTS spectra of alumina-supported (b) Pd, (c) Ag15Pd85 and (d) Ag45Pd55 at elevated temperature in an inert atmosphere from 303 K to 453 K following room temperature CO saturation. 
We also investigated the CO binding strength on these NPs by flushing CO-saturated samples with Ar under a series of temperatures and monitored the CO-desorption process. The temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) DRIFTS results are shown in Fig. 4b–d and Fig. S11.† On both Pd and AgPd NPs, the linear COad starts to desorb at a lower temperature, while the energetically more stable multi-centered *CO disappears at a much higher temperature. Based on these, it is clear that the binding of the CO adsorbate is much stronger at the multi-centered Pd sites, while alloying Pd with Ag will result in a disruption of Pd surface ensembles, diminishing the multi-centered *CO adsorption on AgPd NP surfaces.
DFT calculations were performed to gain a deeper understanding of the impact that Ag–Pd alloying has on CO adsorption strength, an important parameter dictating the CO2 reduction activity.10 AgxPd100−x (111) surfaces (x = 0, 12.5, 25, 50, 75, and 100) were used for the CO binding energy (Eb,CO) calculations, as shown in Fig. 5, and Fig. S12.† For Ag-rich slab models, surface atoms were rearranged to generate Pd bridge and hollow sites (Fig. 5b–d). As shown for Pd (Fig. 5e), CO was found to most favorably bind in the hollow sites (Eb,CO = −1.92 eV at hcp site and −1.91 eV at fcc site) and least favorably bind on atop sites (Eb,CO = −1.38 eV). Upon the introduction of Ag, Eb,CO decreases for each Pd binding site. Due to the weak CO binding nature of Ag, mixed AgPd sites are less important, as Eb,CO at these sites is generally lower than that of the adjacent Pd only sites (Fig. S13†).

The silver atoms represent Ag and blue atoms represent Pd. (e) CO adsorption energies Eb.CO at the different Pd sites calculated for AgPd alloys of varying Ag concentrations (Ag%). In general, the binding energy decreases with increasing Ag concentration and with fewer participating Pd atoms. 
The initial weakening of Eb,CO conflicts with the calculated d-band centers that rise with the addition of Ag up to 50% (Fig. S14†). A contradiction is also seen by comparing Eb,CO from the AgPd alloys to that of strained Pd (Fig. S15†). The tensile strain introduced by Ag would ordinarily strengthen Eb,CO; however, that is clearly not the case we observed in AgPd NPs. This has previously been discussed by Abild-Pedersen et al.49 and is due to an asymmetry in the Pd d-band formed from an energy misalignment with the Ag d orbitals. They adopt an alternative descriptor, εu, defined as the highest peak position of the surface atom d-band Hilbert transform. This descriptor better correlates to the antibonding orbital of the absorbate as described in the Newns–Anderson binding model.50–52 In performing this analysis for our calculations, we find excellent agreement (Fig. S14 and S16–S18†). Up to 50% doping, εu decreases by 0.4 eV and binding energies average a 0.18 eV reduction. Between 50% and 75% doping, however, there is a much greater decrease in εu of 0.75 eV and the binding energies are reduced by another 0.17 eV.
The weakening of Eb,CO is important for improving the CO2 reduction activity since Pd ordinarily binds CO too strongly. We can summarize these calculations by describing two ways in which Ag reduces Eb,CO. First, there is a strong ligand effect that is introduced by Ag. This results in a large perturbation to the Pd d-band shape. The second means, the ensemble effect, is by reducing the number of multi-centered Pd adsorption sites on the surface. Relative to the ligand effect, the ensemble effect generates much greater reductions in Eb,CO at lower Ag concentrations. This is critical because Ag is not important for the activation of CO2 until high overpotentials, and only Pd sites matter. This ensemble effect is the primary source of the observed volcano relationship. Just enough Ag (15%) is needed to break up multi-centered hollow sites, providing balanced surface energetics for CO2 activation as well as CO desorption. Further addition of Ag reverses this balance and lowers overall activity due to the barrier of CO2 activation.
Conclusions
In summary, we synthesized monodisperse AgPd alloy NPs with tunable bimetallic compositions and investigated their catalytic properties for eCO2 RR. It was found that the catalytic performance for the CO production was enhanced and controlled by the bimetallic composition of NPs, with the Ag15Pd85 demonstrating the best performance with high activity, selectivity, and durability at low overpotentials. At −0.8 V, Ag15Pd85 reached a FECO of 100% with a mass activity of 15.2 mA mgmetal−1. The DFT calculations and DRIFTS measurements elucidated that alloying with Ag alleviated the over-strong adsorption of CO over Pd, accelerating eCO2 RR to CO kinetics. This modulation was found to be caused by two effects, i.e., Ag weakens the CO adsorption at all possible Pd sites via the ligand effect and diminishes the strongest CO-binding sites, multi-centered hollow sites in favor of weaker binding atop sites via the ensemble effect.
