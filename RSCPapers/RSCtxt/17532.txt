    , Accepted 13th September 2017First published on 13th September 2017AbstractThis paper reports a new class of visible light water splitting photocatalysts based on a triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) upconversion (UC) process. The TTA-UC core composed of platinum-octaethyl-porphyrin (Pt(OEP)) and 9,10-diphenylanthracene (DPA) can upconvert low energy green light to high energy blue light with a high quantum yield. Using a silica nanocapsule (SNC), the quenching caused by oxygen can be avoided, even in aqueous solutions. The enhancement factor of the photocatalytic activity induced by the UC was estimated to be approximately 3, which indicates that the green to blue UC by the encapsulated Pt(OEP)/DPA can enhance the water splitting activity of CdS significantly. The reduced graphene oxide (rGO) attached to the CdS photocatalyst further enhances the water splitting activity via effective charge separation and suppressed recombination.
Introduction
Developing an ideal photocatalytic material that can split water efficiently under visible light is a significant technical challenge for solving the future energy crisis. For conventional solar water splitting devices, one of the major disadvantages is the wide bandgap of photoelectrode materials, such as TiO2 (∼3.2 eV and ∼3.0 for anatase and rutile, respectively) and ZnO (∼3.4 eV), which limits their photo-action spectrum to the UV region.1,2 Therefore, the efficient utilization of solar energy has been an important theme in renewable energy research aimed to enhance the efficiency using the abundant visible light from solar light. Numerous strategies have been established to mitigate the problem of light absorption in such wide band gap materials, most of which involve chemical modification of the semiconductor to shrink the band gap or add additional energy levels to the band gap, or the addition of organic or inorganic materials that can act as photosensitizers. Recently, an interesting methodology to solve this problem termed triplet–triplet annihilation up-conversion (TTA-UC) was proposed, whereby the low energy light can be converted to a higher energy through a regenerative photochemical process.3–5
The photon UC in multi-component systems has been advanced to achieve a significantly high performance photon energy management scheme and has been considered suitable for wide applications in photonic technologies, particularly in solar cells, bio imaging, and data storage.6–8 The photon UC of sunlight by both organic and/or inorganic materials is an emerging concept to advance hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) production via solar water splitting.9–12 Furthermore, TTA-UC metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), a class of synthetic crystalline organic/inorganic materials, in which the metal centers are linked with organic linkers, have attracted considerable attention.13–15 The wide range of linkers and metal centers make this system a highly versatile family of materials, and TTA-UC MOFs display several fascinating features, including tunable structure, porosity, stiffness, and chemical interactions with guest molecules, which have widened the applications of UC such as in photonic materials,16 cancer therapy17,18 chemical technologies,10 and energy conversion and storage materials.15,19 TTA-UC MOFs, which allow effective energy transfer between the organic struts, can mimic the role of energy harvesting proteins involved in photosynthesis, offering the long-distance directional transport of excitons.20–24
In TTA-UC MOFs, particularly a pair of platinum-octaethyl-porphyrin (Pt(OEP)), the organometallic complex groups, and 9, 10-diphenylanthracene (DPA), the emitter, is used widely in many applications.25–29 Despite the abovementioned advantages, it is very difficult to use UC structures for the photo-electrochemical (PEC) water splitting because UC can be quenched easily by the presence of oxygen molecules.30,31
This paper reports a well-designed PEC catalyst system composed of a reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/CdS photocatalyst and Pt(OEP)/DPA UC materials that are encapsulated in a silica nanocapsule (SNC) shell. A dye pair consisting of DPA as an emitter and Pt(OEP) as a triplet sensitizer was selected as the initial metal organic core complex because of its high reported UC efficiency, which is located in the SNC core to prevent quenching by oxygen molecules. Small sized (∼10–20 nm) CdS nanoparticles were attached to the surface of the SNC because their relatively high conduction band edge position is beneficial for the water splitting reaction.30–34 The rGO was attached to the CdS nanoparticles to prevent the rapid charge recombination characteristics of CdS because it can effectively separate the carriers owing to its high electrical conductivity.3,35 As described in Scheme 1, the final prepared nanostructure consists of (i) green to blue UC materials in the SNC core, (ii) CdS of narrow bandgap photocatalysts on the SNC shell, and (iii) rGO on the CdS nanoparticles.

The PEC catalysts fabricated in this study exhibited approximately 5.8 times higher water splitting efficiency than that of the pristine CdS catalyst through the contribution of rGO and UC materials.
Materials and methods
Fabrication of silica nanocapsule (SNC) encapsulated Pt(OEP)/DPA
Both Pt(OEP) and DPA were dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF, >99.9%; Sigma-Aldrich Co. Ltd, USA) and kept in the dark prior to use. Fig. 1(a and b) presents the chemical structures of Pt(OEP) and DPA, and clear TTA-UC from green to blue of Pt(OEP)/DPA in a deaerated THF solution under a 526 nm green laser. Principally, as shown in Fig. 1(c), the photoexcitation of Pt(OEP)/DPA at 526 nm photoexcites the Q band of Pt(OEP) selectively, promoting it to the first singlet excited state (S1-Pt(OEP)). An efficient population of the first triplet (T1-Pt(OEP)) state follows due to the Pt(II) heavy-metal center that favors the rapid Inter System Crossing (ISC; i.e. S1-Pt(OEP) → T1-Pt(OEP)), allowing the triplet energy transfer (TET) step from the T1-Pt(OEP) manifold to the first triplet manifold of DPA (T1-DPA). Ideally, triplet excitons that formed in the S phase of a solid TTA-UC composite should undergo direct TET from S to A with an efficiency of approximately 100%.26,36,37

To fabricate the SNC encapsulated Pt(OEP)/DPA, 160 μL of a Pt(OEP) solution and 500 μL of a DPA solution were mixed with 5 mL of oleic acid (OA, 90%; Sigma-Aldrich Co. Ltd, USA) and stored overnight in an oven at 80 °C. Subsequently, 300 μL of a mixture was emulsified in 28.8 mL of di-ionized (DI) water under sonication for 5 min followed by vigorous stirring over 1000 rpm for 1 h. To obtain a micelle suspension, 1 mmol of (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (ATES, 98%; Sigma-Aldrich Co. Ltd, USA) was added dropwise (0.2 mL min−1) to the mixture. The surfactant OA was selected based on its ability to dissolve the TTA-UC chromophores and on the compatibility of its anionic terminal groups with self-assembly using cationic surfactants. OA is used as a capping agent to prevent the oxidation of nanoparticles because oleate has a C18 (oleic) tail with a cis-double bond in the middle, forming a kink. Such kinks have been suggested to be essential for effective stabilization.38 More importantly, its unsaturated double bonds also quench singlet oxygen through the ene reaction. During synthesis, the addition of ATES produces a micelle suspension (ATES/OA) through spontaneous self-assembly. Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 98%; Sigma-Aldrich Co. Ltd, USA) was also added at an ATES/TEOS molar ratio of 1:10 to yield SNCs with a better shell thickness as silica network growth on the micelle surface is initiated by the addition of TEOS. The mixture was left to stand at room temperature for ca. 2 h, stirred gently at 150 rpm for 25–30 h at 60 °C, and washed with DI water and ethanol prior to further use and characterization.
Attaching CdS nanoparticles on SNCs
First, the surface of the SNCs was functionalized with amino groups using 0.69 mL of (3-aminopropyl)-trimethoxysilane (APMS, Sigma-Aldrich Co. Ltd, USA) with gentle mixing (150 rpm) at 55 °C for 25–30 h. After washing with DI water, the SNC suspension was mixed with 20 mL of a 0.1 M cadmium chloride (CdCl2, Sigma-Aldrich Co. Ltd, USA) solution for 4 h. The suspension was treated further with 20 mL of a 0.1 M thioacetamide (CH3CSNH2, Sigma-Aldrich Co. Ltd, USA) solution with gentle mixing (150 rpm) at 28.9 °C for 24 h. The final product was washed with DI water.

Attaching rGO on CdS/SNCs. 
GO was synthesized using a modified Hummer's method39,40 and then the GO was reduced by using the mixture of ethanol and water at 90 °C for 3 h. Finally, three different concentrations of 1 wt%, 2 wt% and 3 wt% of rGO were added to the aqueous suspension of CdS–SNC at pH 6.0. The precursor solution was then stirred gently for 2 h at room temperature, centrifuged, and washed with deionized water 4–5 times to obtain the rGO/CdS/SNC.

Instrumental analysis
The optical absorption spectra were obtained using an Analytik Jena SPECORD210 Plus UV–Vis spectrometer (Germany) and a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrophotometer (USA) was used to the analyze the luminescence spectra. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), elemental mapping and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) were performed using a JEOL JSM 6500F scanning electron microscope (USA). The high resolution images of the microstructures were characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, JEM-ARM200F, USA). The chemical compositions and oxidation states of the prepared samples were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific K-alpha, USA).
PEC water splitting measurements
The PEC water splitting tests were conducted at room temperature using a three-electrode electrochemical workstation (IvimStat, IVIUM Tech. Co. Ltd, Netherlands). Initially, the ITO glass substrate (1 cm × 1 cm) was pre-cleaned and annealed at 130° C to increase the adherence of the substrate, and the working electrodes were instantly prepared via spin coating (at 1500 rpm for 200 s with a spin-up time of 20 s) by adding a sufficient quantity of samples to an ethanol solution to completely cover the stationary substrate surface, typically 5–6 drops. After depositing each layer, it was preheated to 60 °C for 3 min in an oven to remove the solvent. Finally, all samples were cured at 60° C for 24 h. The PEC system was composed of the prepared samples on ITO glass substrates as a working electrode, platinum (Pt) wire as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl (3 M) as the reference electrode. A freshly prepared 1.0 M aqueous KOH solution was used as the electrolyte. The PEC performance was determined using a solar simulator (10500, Abet Tech. Co. Ltd, USA, Xe lamp, AM 1.5 global filter, one sun power). The measured potential vs. Ag/AgCl was altered to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale using the Nernst equation. All experiments were performed at a sweep rate of 20 mV s−1.
Results and discussion
The absorption and emission spectra of the individual Pt (OEP) and DPA dissolved in THF show intense sorbet absorption and emission bands, as shown in Fig. 2a. On the other hand, when they were combined as a sensitizer and an annihilator at the ratio, the pair exhibited visible green-to-blue UC under 526 nm green laser light irradiation, as shown previously in Fig. 1b. To optimize the TTA-UC property of Pt(OEP)/DPA, three samples with different Pt(OEP)/DPA ratios were prepared (i.e. 1:2.50, 1:3.13, and 1:3.75 ratios of Pt(OEP) and DPA were mixed in 10 ml THF solutions). As shown Fig. 2(b–f), all samples showed the TTA-UC process by emitting blue light under 526 nm green laser illumination and the intensity of Pt(OEP)/DPA was the highest at a 1:3.13 ratio.

All experiments were conducted in a deaerated THF solution under 526 nm green laser illumination. 
The UC quantum yields (ΦUC) of the Pt(OEP)/DPAs, calculated using the equation described in the ESI,† were 0.286, 0.318, and 0.297 for 1:2.50, 1:3.13, and 1:3.75 ratios, respectively. The maximum theoretical UC quantum efficiency is 0.50 because the TTA-UC process uses two photons to produce one photon with higher energy. The ΦUC value of Pt(OEP)/DPA at a 1:3.13 ratio was comparable to the reported values of 0.26 (ref. 41) (modelling) and 0.30 (ref. 36) (experimental) for the pair consisting of DPA and Pt(OEP) chromophores. The Pt(OEP)/DPA of 1:3.13 ratio was used for further experiments in this study.
The morphology and elemental map of SNCs, CdS/SNC, and rGO/CdS/SNC were examined by SEM and EDX. As shown in Fig. 3, the mean diameter of the SNCs was approximately 400–600 nm and the 10 to 20 nm-sized CdS nanoparticles attached to the SNC surface were observed in CdS/SNCs. The absence and presence of Cd and S atoms of the SNCs and CdS/SNCs (Fig. S1 and S2†), respectively, clearly indicate the loading of sub-band gap semiconducting materials on the SNCs. A small amount of Pt was observed in both samples, which can be due to the presence of Pt(OEP) on the SNC outer surface attached during the fabrication of the SNC encapsulated Pt(OEP)/DPA.

During synthesis, a uniform coverage of CdS with rGO is important for obtaining the synergetic effects between them; otherwise, the photocatalytic activity can be decreased by the high degree of rGO aggregation and low contact area between the rGO and CdS catalysts.37,42 rGO was dispersed uniformly onto the CdS NP surface through simple electrostatic adsorption induced by charge attraction. As shown in the SEM (Fig. 4) and TEM (Fig. 5) images, rGO covers the entire surface of CdS/SNCs, particularly when 2 wt% rGO was used. In addition, the uniform distribution of carbon (Fig. S3†) also confirmed the even distribution of rGO on the rGO/CdS/SNCs.

Fig. 5(d) presents the UC emission of various samples after the SNC encapsulation of Pt(OEP)/DPA and further modification by the CdS and rGO at an excitation wavelength of 526 nm, where water was used as a solvent. Efficient UC was observed, even in the aqueous phase without deoxygenation after encapsulation, suggesting that the SNC can effectively protect Pt(OEP)/DPA from oxygen and it is quite robust and stable during the further processing steps, including functionalization and CdS/rGO formation on its surface.
As shown in Fig. 6a and S4,† XPS of the SNCs revealed Si 2p, Si 2s, and O 1s peaks with no evidence of other impurities. Spectral deconvolution of the Si 2p and O 1s peaks indicate the Si peaks centered at 103.10 and 103.91 eV, and O peaks at 530.35 and 532.16 eV, which are consistent with previous reports.10,19 Before attaching CdS onto the SNCs, the surface was functionalized with a silane coupling agent containing APMS, as described schematically in Fig. 6b. XPS of APMS-treated SNCs indicated the presence of N with Si and O atoms but no other impurities. In addition, as shown in Fig. S5,† the N 1s core level spectrum clearly shows the C–N–H and N–C peaks at 399.47 and 401.50 eV, respectively.
 Fig. 6  XPS spectra and the inset show a schematic diagram of (a) SNCs, (b) surface functionalization of SNCs during synthesis of rGO/CdS attached SNC nanocapsules, (c) CdS-attached SNC and (d) rGO/CdS/SNC. 

Fig. 6c and S6† present the XPS survey spectra and deconvoluted core-level spectra of CdS/SNCs, respectively. The peaks at 405.08 eV and 411.70 eV with a peak separation of 6.62 eV were assigned to the Cd 3d doublet core-level; the S 2p peak was also found at 161.12 eV, which confirmed the formation of CdS on the SNC surface. As shown in Fig. 6d and S7† of rGO/Cds/SNCs, one major peak at 284.74 eV and another minor peak at 286.91 eV, which corresponds to the C–C and hydroxyls (C–OH) groups, respectively, were observed. This confirms the presence of rGO on the CdS/SNC surface with a high degree of reduction of functional groups. The peak positions of Cd 3d and S 2p of rGO/Cds/SNCs were down-shifted slightly compared to those of CdS/SNCs. The most likely reason is that Cd atoms accept electrons from rGO, which increases the electron density around the Cd atoms, decreases the Cd–S bond length, and reduces the binding energies of Cd 3d and S 2p.37,43
To examine the PEC water splitting activity, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) of the half reaction for oxygen (O2) evolution was tested under visible light. Fig. 7 presents a schematic of the water splitting mechanism of rGO/CdS/SNCs. First, low energy green light is up-converted to high energy blue light, which can be absorbed effectively by the CdS photocatalyst. The photo-induced electrons are injected spontaneously from the conduction band of CdS to that of rGO. In addition, the applied positive potential offers a driving force for the electrons to transfer to the rGO, which could increase the charge separation and suppress charge recombination,44 leaving long-lived holes in the CdS to oxidize water and increase the rate of PEC water splitting. Fig. 8(a) and (b) shows the PEC water splitting performance and photon conversion efficiency. No oxidation photocurrent was observed in the absence of light, indicating that all photoelectrodes are inactive toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under dark conditions. When the photoelectrodes are exposed to light, all electrodes show an abundant oxidation photocurrent. Among them, 2 wt% rGO/CdS/SNCs exhibits highest photocatalytic activity and a 5 and 3 times higher photon conversion efficiency than that of CdS alone and rGO/CdS, respectively, which can be due to the contribution of UC induced by the SNC encapsulated Pt(OEP)/DPA. A comparison of the photocurrent between CdS and CdS/SNC, and 2 wt% rGO/CdS/SNC and rGO/CdS revealed an approximately 3-fold enhancement factor of photocatalytic activity induced by the UC, which indicates that green to blue UC by the encapsulated Pt(OEP)/DPA can enhance the water splitting activity of CdS significantly without quenching the chromophore in the aqueous solution.

 Fig. 8  (a) PEC water splitting performance of the prepared samples. (b) Photon conversion efficiency of the various samples under similar bias conditions. 
Typically, in order to enhance the PEC water splitting, the narrow bandgap materials such as CdS is widely used because the bandgap of CdS allows the absorption of visible light and facile transfer of excited electrons to the conduction band of host materials such as Bi2MoO6, WO3, etc.45,46 Recently, several research groups reported the improved PEC performance by the modification of CdS by using various materials such as other semiconductors or carbon related materials,46–54 which are all the modification of the electronic environment of CdS only and no one ever reported the modification of CdS in view of both electronic and photo-related environments. As described in Table 1, by the contribution of both the electronic effect by the rGO and the photo-effect of UC by the encapsulated Pt(OEP)/DPA, we can significantly improve the PEC performance compared to pristine CdS. 2 wt% rGO/CdS/SNC exhibits 8.5 times higher photocurrent than that of pristine CdS, which is around 2 times higher than those of others.

This work











Fig. S8† shows the photo-response behavior of SNC, SNC/CdS and 2 wt% rGO/CdS/SNC samples at 1.2 V vs. RHE. The core/shell structures with the rGO/CdS catalyst have some advantages: (i) TTA-up conversion core for harvesting and upconversion of the broad spectrum of sunlight without quenching by oxygen; (ii) a larger surface area and more active sites than the bulk material, which is beneficial for photocatalytic reactions; and (iii) highly conductive and transparent rGO facilitates the separation and migration of photoexcited electrons toward the inner and outer surfaces without excessive absorption of light, thereby decreasing the recombination of carriers as well as the reverse reaction. An excess of rGO decreases the photocatalytic activity, which might be due to the excessive blocking of the active CdS catalyst and incident light.48–50
Conclusions
This study is a new approach that can realize new classes of visible light water splitting catalysts based on the triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) upconversion process. Enhanced upconversion fluorescence of green to blue emission was observed at the optimized Pt(OEP)/DPA ratio. In the photoelectrochemical water spitting experiment, the highest photocurrent density of ∼0.123 mA cm−1 at 1.750 V vs. RHE with a high photon conversion efficiency of ∼0.57% was achieved for 2 wt% of rGO/CdS attached SNC, which is ∼1.6, 1.8, 2.7, 5.8 and 13.9 times higher than those of 1 wt% rGO/CdS/SNC, CdS/SNC, rGO/CdS, CdS and SNC, respectively, indicating that green to blue UC by the encapsulated Pt(OEP)/DPA can enhance the water splitting activity significantly without quenching the chromophore, even in aqueous solutions. In particular, the present work also offers a facile and universal route to prepare a series of core–shell nanocapsules and structural tuning of materials, which can open up a new area in nanotechnology research to prepare a range of heterojunction materials with a wide range of applications in photocatalysis, photonics, bio-sensors, solar cells, and electrocatalysts.
