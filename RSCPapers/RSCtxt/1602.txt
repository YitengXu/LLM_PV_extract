    , Accepted 4th April 2013First published on 4th April 2013AbstractThree new isoindigo containing donor–acceptor (D–A) type conjugated polymers were synthesized by palladium catalyzed Suzuki polycondensation and used as donor materials for polymer solar cells (PSCs) and field effect transistors (FETs). All the polymers possess good solubility in common organic solvents, high thermal stability, and broad absorption in the range of 300 to 750 nm. These polymers have narrow band gaps (1.66 to 1.70 eV) and low lying HOMO energy levels (5.15 to 5.31 eV). Hole mobilities of these polymers are in the range of 1.78 × 10−3 to 2.62 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. PSCs based on P3:PC71BM (1:2, by weight) gave the best device performance with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.75%, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 4.74 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.81 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.45, indicating these polymers can be promising donor polymers for polymer solar cells.
Introduction
As an alternative to traditional silicon based solar cells, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention because of their low manufacturing cost, light weight, flexibility, and ease of processing.1–5 The most successful and widely used PSCs involve the concept of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure of the active layer. The active layer, which consists of an interpenetrating network of donor conjugated polymers and fullerene derivative acceptors, was sandwiched between a transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) anode and a relatively low work function metal cathode. Recently, significant progress has been achieved due to the rapid development of materials and the optimization of devices.6 Generally, high efficiency donor polymers require (1) appropriate solubility and miscibility with acceptors to form optimal nanoscale morphology in the active layers; (2) well matched HOMO/LUMO positions between the donor and the acceptor to guarantee sufficient driving force for efficient charge separation while maintaining a high open circuit voltage (Voc); (3) a narrow optical band gap, and intense and broad absorption to harvest as many solar photons as possible for a thin active layer; (4) high hole mobility for efficient transport of charge carriers to the electrode. We should consider the above requirements when we design new polymer donor structures.
Generally, low band gap polymers can be obtained by using the most popular strategies based on an electron-rich (donor) and an electron-deficient (acceptor) as repeating units in the polymer backbone to facilitate intramolecular charge transfer between the donor and the acceptor.7,8 By using this strategy, many novel low band gap polymers have been synthesized and used in PSCs with PCEs over 7%.4 Donor units including carbazole,9–11 fluorene,12–14 silafluorene,15,16 thieno[3,4-b]thiophene,17 and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene (BDT),18–20 and acceptor units including quinoxaline,21–23 diketopyrrolopyrrole,24,25 thienopyrazine,26,27 benzothiadiazole,28,29 and thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione30–32 have been used to construct main chain D–A alternating conjugated polymers used for high efficiency polymer solar cells.
Isoindigo, which contains two strong electron-deficient lactam rings with a planar geometry, is a useful monomer for synthesis of D–A alternating type low band gap conjugated polymers for photovoltaic cell applications. Firstly, Reynolds and co-workers reported that the isoindigo-based oligomer based organic solar cells gave a PCE of 1.76%.33 Later, many isoindigo containing conjugated polymers were synthesized and used for polymer solar cells, and the highest PCE was found to be 6.3%.34 It is worth noting that many isoindigo based donor polymers exhibited intense and broad absorption, which is beneficial for achieving high power conversion efficiency (PCE) for polymer solar cells. However, until now many isoindigo containing conjugated polymer based solar cells has shown lower PCE. As we know, intense and broad absorption is necessary, but cannot guarantee high PCE. The morphology of the active layer also plays a pivotal role in determining the PCE. In our previous studies, we have demonstrated that donor polymers with a planar structure can facilitate the packing of polymer chains in the solid state and give higher PCE.9,38
Here, we report the design and synthesis of three novel isoindigo containing D–A alternating conjugated polymers (P1, P2, and P3), in which 2,7-linked 9-octyl-9H-carbazole, 9-alkylidene-9H-fluorene, and dialkoxyphenylene were used as the donor units.9,37 Due to the S–O supramolecular interaction, these three polymers should have a relatively planar polymer backbone. In addition, these three donor monomers have different electron-donating abilities, which could tune the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the resulting polymers. The thermal, photophysical, and electrochemical properties of these three polymers were investigated in detail. We have found that these polymers have a high hole mobility of up to 2.62 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. Polymer solar cells were fabricated with these polymers as donors and PC71BM as the acceptor. When 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) (0.5% by volume) was used as the additive for the fabrication of polymer solar cells, devices based on P3:PC71BM (1:2, by weight) gave the best photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 1.75%.
Experimental section
Materials
All reagents and starting materials were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification, unless otherwise noted. Solvents were dried using standard procedures. The catalyst precursor Pd(PPh3)4 was prepared according to the literature35 and stored in a Schlenk tube under nitrogen. 6,6′-Dibromoisoindigo (1),33 2,7-dibromo-9-dodecyl-9H-carbazole (5),36M5,37 2,7-dibromo-9-(heptadecan-9-ylidene)-9H-fluorene (7),38 and 1,4-dibromo-2,5-bis(dodecyloxy)benzene (9)39 were synthesized according to the literature methods. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and diethyl ether (Et2O) were distilled from sodium with benzophenone as an indicator under a nitrogen atmosphere. Hexane and dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) were distilled from CaH2. CHCl3 was distilled before use. All reactions were performed under an atmosphere of nitrogen and monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC) on a silica gel 60 F254 (Merck, 0.2 mm). Column chromatography was carried out on silica gel (200–300 mesh).
Instruments

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DM 300 or AV 400 spectrometer in CDCl3. The film samples for measuring UV-vis spectra were spin-coated from 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) solutions with 0.5% DIO by volume on cleaned glass substrates. UV-vis absorption spectra were obtained on a Shimadzu UV-vis spectrometer model UV-1601PC. Elemental analyses were performed on a Flash EA 1112 analyzer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed on a TA2100 and Perkin-Elmer Diamond DSC instrument, respectively, under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 to record TGA and DSC curves. Number- (Mn) and weight-average (Mw) molecular weights were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) on a PL-GPC 50 with THF as an eluent and calibrated with polystyrene standards. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of blend films were obtained on a Nanoscope IIIa Dimension 3100 operating in the tapping mode. The thickness was determined by a Dektak 6 M surface profilometer. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected using a PANalytical X'Pert PRO MPD diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The electrochemical behavior of all the polymers was investigated by using cyclic voltammetry (CHI 630A electrochemical analyzer) with a standard three-electrode electrochemical cell in a 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (Bu4NPF6) solution in CH3CN at room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere with a scanning rate of 0.1 V s−1. A glassy carbon working electrode, a Pt wire counter electrode, and an Ag/AgNO3 (0.01 M in CH3CN) reference electrode were used. The experiments were calibrated with the standard ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc) redox system and assumption that the energy level of Fc is 4.8 eV below vacuum.40
Fabrication and characterization of organic field-effect transistors (OFETs)
Top-contact/bottom-gate (TC/BG) OTFT devices were fabricated using n+-Si/SiO2 substrates where n+-Si and SiO2 were used as the gate electrode and gate dielectric, respectively. The substrates were subjected to cleaning using ultrasonication in acetone, a cleaning agent, deionized water (twice), and iso-propanol. The cleaned substrates were dried under vacuum at 80 °C. The substrates were then treated with plasma for 15 min and transferred into a glove box. The substrates were modified with OTS according to the literature reported by Bao and co-workers.41 Thin films of the polymer were deposited on the treated substrates by spin coating using a polymer solution (6 mg mL−1) in trichloroethylene (TCE), optionally followed by thermal annealing at 180 °C for 2 h under nitrogen. After polymer thin film deposition, about 30 nm thick gold was deposited as source and drain contacts using a shadow mask. The OTFT devices had a channel length (L) of 60 μm and a channel width (W) of 2.4 mm. The evaluation of the OTFTs was carried out in atmosphere (20 °C, humidity of 50–60%) using a Keithley 4200 parameter analyzer on a probe stage.
Fabrication and characterization of BHJ polymer solar cells
All the polymer solar cell devices were fabricated with the device configuration of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/LiF/Al. The conductivity of ITO is 15 Ω □−1 and PEDOT:PSS is Baytron Al 4083 from H. C. Starck. ITO-coated glass substrates were ultrasonically cleaned sequentially in detergent, water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol. The substrates were covered by a 30 nm layer of PEDOT:PSS by spin coating. After annealing in air at 140 °C for 10 min, the samples were cooled to room temperature. The substrates were then transferred into a nitrogen-filled glove box. The polymers and PC71BM were dissolved in a 1:2 weight ratio in DCB with 0.5% (v/v) of DIO. The solutions were then heated at 90 °C and stirred overnight. The photoactive layer was then spin coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer at 1500 rpm speed. The top electrode was thermally evaporated, with a 0.6 nm LiF layer, followed by 80 nm of aluminum at a pressure of 10−6 Torr through a shadow mask. Six cells were fabricated on one substrate and the effective area of every cell was 4 mm2. The measurement of devices was conducted in the glove box. Current–voltage characteristics were recorded using a Keithley 2400 Source Meter under AM 1.5 illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 from a solar simulator (Model SS-50A, photo Emission Tech., Inc.). The J–V curves were recorded at the temperature of about 20 °C. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were characterized using a Keithley 485 picoammeter under illumination of monochromatic light through the ITO side of devices.

General procedure for the synthesis of conjugated polymers (P1, P2, and P3)
In a 100 mL two necked flask, a mixture of bis(pinacolato)diboron isoindigo monomer M5 (0.11 mmol, 1 equiv.), dibromo comonomer (0.11 mmol, 1 equiv.), THF, toluene, H2O, and NaHCO3 was carefully degassed before and after Pd(PPh3)4 was added. The mixture was stirred and refluxed for different reaction times under a nitrogen atmosphere. Phenylboronic acid and Pd(PPh3)4 were added and refluxed for 4 h; after that bromobenzene was added, and the mixture was refluxed overnight to complete the end-capping reaction. After being cooled to room temperature, water and chlorobenzene were added, and the organic layer was separated and washed three times with water. And then, the solution was heated to 100 °C to dissolve the polymers and filtered. After the removal of most solvent, the residue was poured into a large amount of acetone, and the resulting precipitates were collected by filtration and washed with acetone. The crude product was redissolved in a minimum amount of chlorobenzene and precipitated into a large amount of acetone. The formed precipitates were collected by filtration and dried under high vacuum.

Results and discussion
Synthesis of monomers and polymers
Polymers P1–3 used for the fabrication of polymer solar cells are shown in Chart 1. As shown in Scheme 1, polymers P1, P2, and P3 can be prepared by Suzuki polycondensation of isoindigo based dibromo monomer M1 with diboronic acid pinacol ester based monomers M2, M3, and M4, respectively. 6,6-Dibromoisoindigo (1) was synthesized by condensation of the commercially available 6-bromoisatin and 6-bromooxindole in acetic acid with a small amount of hydrochloric acid as the catalyst. The attachment of two dodecyls onto the nitrogen atom of 1 under 1-bromododecane/K2CO3/DMF conditions afforded 2 in a yield of 82%. Suzuki cross-coupling of 2 and thiophene-2-boronic acid pinacol ester afforded (E)-1-dodecyl-3-(1-dodecyl-2-oxo-6-(thiophen-2-yl)indolin-3-ylidene)-6-(thiophen-2-yl)indolin-2-one (3) in a yield of 77%. However, the desired monomer M1 could not be prepared; the bromination of 3 with NBS furnished the tetrabromide 4 rather than M1.

Alternatively, the reaction of 2 and bis(pinacolato)diboron under Miyaura reaction conditions could afford monomer M5 in a yield of 71% as shown in Scheme 2. The synthesis of carbazole based dibromo monomer M6 was started from N-dodecyl-2,7-dibromocarbazole (5), its coupling with thiophene-2-boronic acid pinacol ester was carried out under Suzuki reaction conditions using Pd2(dba)3 and tri(o-tolyl)phosphine as the catalyst precursors, tetrabutylammonium bromide as the phase transfer catalyst, and toluene–sodium bicarbonate aqueous solution as the solvent to afford compound 6 in a yield of 66%. The bromination of 6 with NBS in CHCl3 afforded M6 in a yield of 61%. Similarly, the coupling of 2,7-dibromo-9-(heptadecan-9-ylidene)-9H-fluorene (7) and thiophene-2-boronic acid pinacol ester using the same reaction conditions as for the preparation of 6 furnished compound 8 in a yield of 70%, which was brominated with NBS to give M7 in a yield of 77%. M8 was prepared in two steps from 1,4-dibromo-2,5-dimethoxybenzene (9). Firstly, the coupling of 9 and 4-octylthiophene-2-boronic acid ester afforded compound 10 in a yield of 54%, which was brominated with NBS to accomplish M8 in a yield of 73%. As shown in Scheme 3, polymers P1, P2 and P3 were synthesized in yields of 47%, 52%, and 60% by Suzuki–Miyaura polycondensation of isoindigo based diboronic acid pinacol ester M5 with dibromo monomers M6, M7, and M8, respectively. The polycondensation was carried out in a biphasic mixture of toluene and aqueous NaHCO3 with freshly prepared Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst precursor under a nitrogen atmosphere. After the polymerization, phenylboronic acid and then bromobenzene were consecutively added at a time interval of 4 h to end-cap the polymers. The chemical structures of the polymers were confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy as well as elemental analysis.

All the polymers showed good solubility in common organic solvents such as CHCl3, chlorobenzene (CB), DCB and THF. The number average molecular weights (Mn) and polydispersity indexes of the polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) at room temperature with THF as an eluent calibrated with polystyrene standards. The GPC results are listed in Table 1.

Thermal properties
The thermal properties of these isoindigo based polymers were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). As shown in Fig. 1a, all of these isoindigo based polymers exhibited good thermal stability with the 5% weight loss temperature (Td) higher than 392 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. The onset decomposition temperature of polymers P1, P2 and P3 with 5% weight loss is located at 407, 401 and 392 °C, respectively, due to the cleavage of alkoxy or alkyl groups. The data are also summarized in Table 1. For P1 and P2, no noticeable thermal transition was observed from 25 to 300 °C by DSC measurements, which is probably attributed to the rigid backbone that limits the chain motion. The DSC curves of P3 are shown in Fig. 1b. P3 did not exhibit any glass transition, but exhibited an endothermic peak at 243 °C upon heating and an exothermic peak at 181 °C upon cooling, which could be ascribed to the melting and crystallization of the polymer backbone.42,43

Hole mobility and solar cell efficiency of narrow band gap conjugated polymers are closely related to their packing in the solid state. Therefore, X-ray diffractions (XRD) of powdery samples of P1–3 were measured and the diffraction patterns are shown in Fig. S1.† All polymers exhibited two diffraction peaks; sharp diffraction peaks at smaller angle regions reflecting the highly ordered assembly and crystallinity, and the broad and strong peak intensities centered at 2θ = 21–22° are associated with the π–π distance between polymer backbones suggesting better organization and closer co-facial interlayer π–π stacking in the polymer. From the diffractograms, the distinct diffraction peaks at 2θ = 4.67, 4.23 and 3.56° correspond to the d spacing values of 18.93, 20.85 and 24.81 Å for P1, P2 and P3, respectively, which are assigned to the distance between the polymer backbones separated by alkyl side chains. The π–π distances between the polymer backbones are 4.05 Å for P1, 4.02 Å for P2, and 4.17 Å for P3. The short distance exhibited by the polymers is believed to be the result of a relatively planar conformation and the close stacking of the polymer backbones in the solid state.44,45
Optical properties
To assess their photophysical properties, three polymers both in CHCl3 solutions and as thin films spin coated on quartz substrates were investigated with UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and the spectra are shown in Fig. 2. The results are summarized in Table 2. All absorption spectra exhibited two distinct peaks in the wavelength ranges of 330–480 and 480–730 nm with a shoulder in the longer wavelength region. In CHCl3 solution, the λmax of low energy bands is located at 613, 611, and 601 nm and the λmax for high energy bands is centered at 397, 394, and 391 nm for P1, P2 and P3, respectively. The high energy bands are attributed to the π–π* transition, whereas the low energy bands are due to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the donor and acceptor units. Fig. 2b shows the film optical absorption spectra. In the film absorption spectra, the maximum absorption peaks of P1, P2 and P3 are located at 616, 613, and 606 nm, respectively. Compared to their corresponding solution absorption spectra, all the film absorption spectra exhibited only a slight red-shift. The film absorption edges (λedge) are 744 nm for P1, 739 nm for P2, and 726 nm for P3. According to the equation Eoptg = 1240/λedge, the optical band gaps (Eoptg) were calculated to be 1.66 eV for P1, 1.67 eV for P2, and 1.70 eV for P3, which are in the ideal band gap range for donor polymers.

Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical redox behavior of polymers was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). CV measurements were performed using a polymer film on the Pt electrode with a standard three-electrode electrochemical cell in a 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) solution in acetonitrile with a scanning rate of 50 mV s−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature. The cyclic voltammograms of P1–3 are shown in Fig. 3 and the CV data are summarized in Table 2. The onset oxidation potentials of P1, P2 and P3 are 0.44, 0.40, and 0.56 V versus Ag/Ag+, respectively, indicating that these polymers are air stable. The HOMO energy levels were calculated to be 5.19 eV for P1, 5.15 eV for P2, and 5.31 eV for P3 according to the equation EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.71) (eV), where Eox is the onset oxidation potential in volts. Considering that the open circuit voltage (Voc) of PSCs is correlated with the difference of the LUMO energy level of the acceptor and the HOMO energy level of the donor polymer,46 the relatively deep HOMO level of these polymers may give high Voc for the photovoltaic cell. The energy level diagrams of P1–3 are also shown in Fig. 3. The offsets between the donor polymer and the acceptor PC71BM are larger than 0.3 eV, indicating that there is enough driving force for electron transfer from the polymer to acceptor.46–48

Field-effect transistor fabrication and characterization
Bottom-gate/top-contact (BG/TC) devices were fabricated by spin-coating the polymer solutions (6 mg mL−1) onto octadecyltrimethoxysilane (OTS) treated SiO2 (300 nm) on a heavily doped Si substrate. The OTS self-assembled monolayer was deposited according to the method reported by Bao and co-workers,41 which showed a high crystalline ultra-smooth surface and improved performances for vacuum-deposited OFETs. The hole mobility (μ) was estimated in the saturated regime from the derivative plots of the square root of source–drain current (ISD) versus gate voltage (VG) through equation ISD = (W/2L)Ciμ(VG − VT)2 where W is the channel width, L is the channel length, Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric layer (SiO2, 300 nm, Ci = 11 nF cm−2), and VT is the threshold voltage. The output and transfer characteristic curves of the spin-coated films of P1, P2, and P3 on OTS-treated n+-Si/SiO2 substrates are shown in Fig. 4. We used TCE as the solvent for polymers to fabricate thin film transistors. For P1–3, the as-prepared spin-coated films did not exhibit any observable field effect. However, after annealing the films at 180 °C for 30 min the hole mobilities of P1, P2 and P3 are 2.13 × 10−3, 2.62 × 10−3 and 1.78 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The on/off ratios are 6.45 × 103 for P1, 2.69 × 103 for P2, and 2.05 × 104 for P3. These results indicated that these polymers are promising donor materials for polymer solar cells.

Photovoltaic properties
The broad absorption, narrow band gap, and appropriate HOMO/LUMO levels make these polymers promising donor materials for BHJ PSCs. Photovoltaic properties of P1–3 were investigated in a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/LiF/Al. The active layer is a blend of polymer and PC71BM; DCB was used as the processing solvent; and the measurement was performed under the illumination of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2). Compared with PC61BM, PC71BM exhibits higher absorptivity in the visible region and a slightly lower LUMO level, which can provide larger driving force for charge transfer from the polymer to the acceptor.49 The device performances are summarized in Table 3. After optimization, P1 based polymer solar cells showed a Voc of 0.70 V, a short circuit current (Jsc) of 2.05 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 0.41, and a PCE of 0.6%; P2 based polymer solar cells showed a Voc of 0.57 V, a Jsc of 2.17 mA cm−2, an FF of 0.36, and a PCE of 0.45%; and P3 based devices showed a Voc of 0.72 V, a Jsc of 3.53 mA cm−2, an FF of 0.42, and a PCE of 1.06%. DIO is less volatile than DCB, and it can be used to adjust the phase separation behavior between the polymer donor and the PC71BM acceptor during the drying process. Fig. 5a displayed the current–voltage (I–V) curves of the optimized solar cells fabricated with DCB as a processing solvent and DIO (0.5%, by volume) as the additive. When the ratio of polymer to PC71BM is 1:2 and DIO was used as the additive, the device showed the best performance. As shown in Table 3, the Voc, Jsc, and FF of P1–3:PC71BM based photovoltaic devices can be simultaneously improved after the use of DIO as the additive. PCEs of the devices were improved from 0.6% to 1.70% for P1, from 0.45% to 1.08 for P2, and from 1.06% to 1.75% for P3. Among three polymers, P3 based polymer solar cells showed the highest Voc of 0.81 V, which could be attributed to its deeper HOMO energy level.

The film morphology of active layers has been found to be one of the essential elements in determining the PCE of PSCs. To better understand the reasons for low Jsc and FF of these polymers, we used AFM to probe the surface morphology of the blend films of P1–3:PC71BM (1:2, by weight) and the results are shown in Fig. 6. As shown in Fig. 6a–c, the blend films of P1–3:PC71BM spin coated from DCB solutions showed a rough surface with larger phase separation, in which the dark area is attributed to PC71BM domains because the electron scattering density of PC71BM is higher than that of the conjugated polymer. The root-mean-square (rms) roughness for the P1:PC71BM, P2:PC71BM, and P3:PC71BM (1:2, by weight) blend films are 2.30, 1.61, and 2.76 nm, respectively. When DIO (0.5% by volume) was used as the additive, the surface morphology of P1:PC71BM, P2:PC71BM, and P3:PC71BM (1:2, by weight) blend films became smoother, the domain size became smaller, and the rms values decreased to 2.17, 1.47, and 0.758 nm, respectively. The above results indicate that miscibility of the donor polymer and acceptor is increased, which will lead to a large interface for exciton dissociation and probably bicontinuous interpenetrating networks for better charge separation and transport. The AFM results can well elucidate the correlation of device performance and the morphology of the active layer.

To confirm the accuracy of Jsc measurements, we measured the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of PSCs with the blend of polymer:PC71BM as the active layer under monochromatic light. As shown in Fig. 5b, P1–3:PC71BM (1:2, by weight) based polymer solar cells showed a broad photoresponse ranging from 400 to 750 nm, which is consistent with the UV-vis absorption spectra of the blend film shown in Fig. 2c. Comparing with EQE curves of P1:PC71BM and P2:PC71BM, the EQE values of P3:PC71BM are higher. The maximum EQE of P3:PC71BM based devices is 24% at a wavelength of 542 nm, which agreed well with the higher Jsc value obtained from the P3:PC71BM based devices.
Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized three new D–A type π-conjugated polymers containing an isoindigo acceptor unit by Suzuki polycondensation. The polymers possess good solubility in common organic solvents, high thermal stability, and broad absorption in the range of 300 to 750 nm. The polymers have narrow band gaps (from 1.66 to 1.70 eV) with low lying HOMO energy levels (from 5.15 to 5.31 eV). Hole mobilities of polymers range from 1.78 × 10−3 to 2.62 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 with the on/off ratio larger than 103. Polymer solar cells were fabricated with the blends of P1–3:PC71BM as the active layer. When 0.5% DIO was used as the additive, the PCE of the P3:PC71BM based devices reached 1.75% with Jsc = 4.74 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.81 V, and FF = 0.45 under the illumination of AM 1.5G. These results indicate that isoindigo containing polymers could be promising donor materials for polymer solar cell applications.
