    , Accepted 6th January 2015First published on 6th January 2015AbstractThe novel D–A–π–A–D type molecules, FT1 and FT2, with varied molecular conformation were designed utilizing different fused hetero-aromatic units as the π-bridge building centers. FT1 with a dibenzo-quinquethiophene (DBQT) building center exhibited an eagle-shaped molecular conformation, whereas, FT2 with a dibenzo-sexithiophene (DBST) building center displayed a linear-shaped molecular conformation. In contrast to FT1, FT2 exhibited a much more planar molecular structure and more ordered inter-chain packing. An enhanced power conversion efficiency of 1.71% and short current density of 5.78 mA cm−2 were obtained in the FT2/PC71BM-based OSCs, which were 1.7 times and 1.5 times the corresponding values of the FT1/PC71BM-based cells. Our work demonstrated that the fused hetero-aromatic building centers can significantly affect the molecular conformation and that the photovoltaic performance of small molecules can also be improved by altering the molecular conformation in OSCs.
Introduction
Solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) are under intense investigation due to their advantages of low cost, light weight and flexibility in large area applications.1–4 Currently, the performance of OSCs has increased dramatically and power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 9% has been obtained in bulk hetero-junction (BHJ) based polymer solar cells (PSCs).5 A record-breaking performance of up to 10.6% was achieved for tandem PSCs.6 Although impressive performance has been made in PSCs, conjugated polymers are subjected to inevitable drawbacks such as batch-to-batch variation of molecular weight and complicated purification.7,8 In contrast to these polymer counterparts, small molecules (SMs) offer plenty of potential advantages such as a well-defined molecular structure and no end group contaminants.3,4,9–11 Therefore, the SMs-based OSCs (SM-OSCs) have attracted increasing attention recently. With the designed innovation of SMs, the PCE of SM-OSCs has also reached 8%.12 To enhance the photovoltaic performance of SM-OSCs, there are some basic requirements: (1) a broad and strong light absorption in the visible region; (2) high charge carrier mobility to increase the short circuit current density (Jsc); and (3) matched energy levels to facilitate the exciton dissociation and obtain a higher open circuit voltage (Voc).3,4 One efficient strategy to obtain “ideal SMs” is to construct D–A type molecules by combining a proper electron-rich donor moiety (D) and electron-deficient acceptor moiety (A) to produce intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT).13 Incorporating planar molecular structures in SMs is another promising approach.14–16 It is well known that molecules with planar structures have more effective π-electron delocalization and an enhanced π–π stacking effect, which make this class of SMs exhibit extended absorption, narrowed band gap and increased charge carrier mobility. Furthermore, the rigid planar structure can also seriously affect the molecular conformation and the investigation has demonstrated that the molecular conformation can play a significant role in the molecular order, packing and morphology in the solid state that affect the device’s performance.17–20 For instance, molecules with a straight linear backbone reported by Takimiya et al. exhibited a highly crystalline morphology and higher charge carrier mobility than those molecules with branched or zig-zagged linear backbones.21 However, though tremendous efforts have been made, SMs with a fused hetero-aromatic moiety still haven't exhibited satisfactory performance. The relationship between the structure and properties in these SMs hasn't been well understood. Meanwhile, owing to the lack of model systems, methods of altering the molecular conformation to enhance the photovoltaic performance have also been seldom investigated to date.
Herein, to enrich the tool-box of SMs based on fused hetero-aromatic building blocks in SM-OSCs and further understand the correlation between molecular conformation and photovoltaic performance, two novel D–A–π–A–D type SMs, FT1 and FT2, were designed and synthesized with two different fused hetero-aromatic π-bridge building centers, respectively. As 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) is a good electron-withdrawing unit14,22–26 and alkyl-carbazole is an excellent hole-transporting unit, they were attached simultaneously at the side of the π-bridged building centers as the A and D units, respectively. The thermal, UV-vis absorption and electro-chemical properties, as well as their photovoltaic performance were well characterized for this type of SMs. As expected, the fused hetero-aromatic π-bridged building centers play an active role in the molecular conformation and properties. FT1 with a dibenzo-quinquethiophene (DBQT) building center exhibited an eagle-shaped molecular conformation, whereas, FT2 with a dibenzo-sexithiophene (DBST) building center displayed an almost linear-shaped molecular conformation. In contrast to FT1, FT2 exhibited a broader absorption and more ordered inter-chain packing in the film state owing to its better molecular planarity and enlarged conjugation system. Furthermore, the FT2/PC71BM-based cells exhibited better photovoltaic performance than the FT1/PC71BM-based cells. A PCE of 1.71% and Jsc of 5.78 mA cm−2 were obtained in FT2/PC71BM-based cells, which are 1.7 times and 1.5 times the corresponding values of the FT1/PC71BM-based cells, respectively. This work demonstrates that the fused hetero-aromatic building centers can affect the molecular conformation and the photovoltaic performance of SMs and can be significantly improved by tuning the molecular conformation in OSCs.

To a 100 mL three neck flask filled with compound 1 (1.0 g, 1.57 mmol) in 50 mL of dry DMF, N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) (0.64 g, 3.6 mmol) was added in several portions at 0 °C under nitrogen atmosphere. The mixture was then stirred for 8 h at room temperature (RT) and monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC). Then, the reaction was quenched with water (50 mL) and the mixture extracted with chloroform (CHCl3).

Then, 1,2-dibromotetrachloroethane (2.2 g, 6.6 mmol) in 10 mL of anhydrous THF was injected and the reaction mixture allowed to warm to RT and stirred overnight. The mixture was then quenched with water and extracted with diethyl ether. The collected organic layer was washed with brine (3 × 100 mL).

Characterization and measurements
All 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV-400 using CDCl3 as the solvent. Elemental analyses were carried out on a Heraus CHN-rapid elemental analyzer. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed on a Bruker Bifiex III MALDI TOF. UV-vis spectra were measured on a Perkin-Elmer Lamada 25 spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed on a Netzsch TG 209 analyzer and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measured on a TA Q200 instrument under nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1. Cyclic voltammograms (CV) were performed with a three-electrode electrochemical cell in a 0.1 M tetra(n-butyl) ammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) solution with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 at room temperature under argon atmosphere. A platinum wire and Ag/AgCl (0.1 M) as were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The reference electrode was calibrated against the redox potential of ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+). The thin film on the Pt disk, formed by drop-casting a chloroform solution (analytical reagent, 10 mg mL−1) was used as the working electrode. X-ray diffractograms were obtained using a X-ray diffractometer (New D8 Advance, Bruker) with Cu Kα (k = 1.54 Å) radiation. The theoretical study was performed using density functional theory (DFT) as approximated by the B3LYP function employing the 6-31G** basis set in Gaussian 09.
Fabrication and characterization of the organic solar cells
The photovoltaic cells were constructed with a traditional sandwich structure using the following steps. Indium-tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates were cleaned by a series of ultrasonic treatments for 10 min in acetone, deionized water and 2-propanol, respectively. The substrates were dried under a stream of nitrogen and subjected to the treatment of Ar/O2 plasma for 5 min. A filtered aqueous solution of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS; Bayer AG) was spun-cast onto the ITO surface at 2000 rpm for 30 s, then baked at 150 °C for 30 min to form a PEDOT:PSS thin film with a thickness of 30 nm. A blend of SMs (15 mg mL−1) and PC71BM was dissolved in chlorobenzene (CB), filtered through a 0.45 μm poly(tetrafluoroethylene) filter and spun-cast onto the PEDOT:PSS layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The substrates were dried under N2 atmosphere at room temperature and then annealed at 150 °C for 15 min in a nitrogen-filled glove box. The devices were completed after thermal deposition of a 10 nm calcium and a 100 nm aluminum film as the cathode at a pressure of 6 × 10−4 Pa. The active area was 0.1 cm2 for each cell. The thicknesses of the spun-cast films were recorded by a profilometer (Alpha-Step 200; Tencor Instruments).
Device characterization was carried out under an AM 1.5 G irradiation with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (Oriel 91160, 300 W). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured with a computer-controlled Keithley 2602 source measurement unit in the dark. PCE was detected under a monochromatic illumination (Oriel Corner-stone 260 1/4 m monochromator equipped with Oriel 70613NS QTH lamp) and the calibration of the incident light was performed with a monocrystalline silicon diode. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured with a source meter, silicon photodiode and a computer-controlled light source-monochromator-lock-in system. All device fabrication procedures and measurements were carried out in air at room temperature.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthetic routes used towards FT1 and FT2 are outlined in Scheme 1. Owing to the high reactivity of the α-position in the thiophene ring, bromination of compound 1 and 3 takes place at first according to the literature precedent.29,30 Then, the oxidation was carried out to fasten the four outer thiophene rings together to obtain M1 and M2 using anhydrous FeCl3 in a moderate yield.31 Finally, the target molecules, FT1 and FT2, were prepared using the well-known Suzuki coupling reaction in moderate yield. Their chemical structures were confirmed by 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis and TOF-MS. Excellent solubility in common organic solvents, such as CHCl3, THF and CB was observed for both SMs.

Theoretical calculations
Theoretical calculations were carried out using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G** level to understand the molecular conformations of FT1 and FT2 in detail. To make the calculation easier, an ethyl group was used to replace the octyl group. The minimum-energy conformations of FT1 and FT2 are represented in Fig. 1, including the top view and side view. From the top view, an eagle-shaped conformation for FT1 and linear-shaped conformation for FT2 were observed. From the side view, FT2 displayed a better molecular planarity than FT1. Good molecular planarity is often considered to have good π–π stacking properties and improve the charge transfer ability, which then result in an enhanced performance for the OSCs.32 Additionally, the electron-state-density distributions of FT1 and FT2 are also displayed (Fig. S1, see ESI†). For both FT1 and FT2, the electron-state-density is mainly distributed on the fused hetero-aromatic moiety (DBQT and DBST) for the HOMO and on the BT unit for the LUMO, which is consistent with the reported literature.33

Thermal properties
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves were recorded to investigate the thermal stability of FT1 and FT2 at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 under an inert atmosphere and the corresponding data listed in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2a, FT1 and FT2 exhibit a decomposition temperature (Td) at 440 and 460 °C, respectively, corresponding to a 5% weight loss. The result indicated that incorporating an enlarged fused heteroaromatic building block into SM is beneficial for increasing the Td value and thermal stability. Fig. 2b depicts the DSC curves for FT1 and FT2. No melting and crystallization processes were observed during the heating and cooling processes for FT1. However, two distinct endothermic peaks at 239 and 265 °C were exhibited for FT2 during the heating process, which result from an additional new phase transition and melting process, respectively.34 In addition, an exothermic peak at approximately 236 °C appeared simultaneously during the cooling process, corresponding to the crystallization process. The different DCS results indicate that FT2 was packed more orderly due to its more planar molecular conformation. Based on the above theoretical calculations (Fig. S2, see ESI†), FT1 with an eagle-shaped conformation was expected to exhibit two extremely different packing modes and probably some other modes in the solid state leading to an amorphous property for FT1 with no melting and crystallization. However, FT2 with a linear conformation is expected to display a general packing mode and good π–π stacking.17 The different packing modes for FT1 and FT2 can further provide a reasonable explanation for the different DSC behavior.

Optical properties
The normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of FT1 and FT2 in dilute chloroform solution ([c] = 6.4 × 10−5, 5.2 × 10−5 M for FT1 and FT2, respectively) and film state are shown in Fig. 3. A broad absorption profile ranging from 350 to 680 nm with two obvious absorption peaks was observed for FT1 and FT2. The high-lying region at about 390 nm corresponds to the π–π* transition and the low-lying region from 500 to 580 nm was assigned to the ICT interaction between D (DBQT and DBST) and A (BT) units.7,15 In contrast to FT1, FT2 exhibits a red-shift absorption profile in solution due to its enlarged conjugation system and better planarity.9 A significant red-shift absorption from solution to film state was also observed for both SMs, indicating a much ordered inter-chain π–π stacking existed in the solid state.15 Additionally, as shown in Fig. S3 (see ESI†) and summarized in Table 1, the molar extinction coefficients (ε) of the low-lying peak for FT1 and FT2 were measured to be 2.9 × 104 and 5.2 × 104 M−1 cm−1, respectively. The higher absorption coefficients for FT2 could further lead to the improved Jsc. The low optical band gaps of 1.88 and 1.86 eV were estimated from their absorption onsets in the FT1 and FT2 films, respectively.

Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out to investigate the electrochemical properties of both SMs using Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode and the redox potential of ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as the calibrated standard. Fig. 4 shows the recorded CV curve and the correlated data are listed in Table 1. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels (EHOMO, ELUMO) were calculated from the onset oxidation potential (Eox) and the onset reduction potential (Ered) according to the following equations:35EHOMO (eV) = −(Eonset,ox.vs.Fc+/Fc + 5.1)ELUMO (eV) = −(Eonset,red.vs.Fc+/Fc + 5.1)
Therefore, the calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels (EHOMO/ELUMO) were −5.60 eV/−3.28 eV for FT1 and −5.48 eV/−3.23 eV for FT2. A deeper HOMO energy level is observed for FT1 owing to its low π-electron delocalization caused by its twisted molecular structure.36 However, similar LUMO energy levels were exhibited for FT1 and FT2, which match well with the LUMO energy level of PC71BM indicating that the charge transfer could be expected to efficiently occur in their corresponding devices.

Photovoltaic performance
To investigate the effect of molecular conformation on the photovoltaic properties, the BHJ SM-OSCs were fabricated with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al. As the processing parameters of the devices, such as the donor/acceptor material ratio in the photoactive layer and thermal annealing temperature can seriously affect the device performance these parameters were optimized at first.37 For comparison, the influence of the blending ratio on the performance of the OSCs is depicted in Fig. S4 (see ESI†). The optimized blending ratio of FT1 and FT2 to PC71BM are 1:2 and 1:1, respectively. In addition, the annealing temperature was optimized to be 25 °C and 110 °C, respectively. In their corresponding optimized conditions, the current density–voltage characteristics of the SM-OSCs were recorded and shown in Fig. 5 under an illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW m−2 (Table 2). It is obvious that FT2 with its highly planar structure exhibited better photovoltaic performance than FT1 in the OSCs owing to its efficient π–π stacking and enhanced charge transfer ability.32 While the maximum PCE of 1.04% with a Jsc value of 3.76 mA cm−2 and a Voc value of 0.76 V was obtained in the FT1/PC71BM-based devices, the FT2/PC71BM-based devices exhibited an enhanced PCE of 1.71% with a Jsc value of 5.78 mA cm−2 and a comparable Voc value of 0.75 V. In order to understand why FT2 exhibited better photovoltaic properties than FT1 in the devices and the reasons for the poor FF value here, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the cells and morphologies of the active layers were further investigated. Fig. 6 shows the EQE curves of the SMs-based cells. A much broader response region from 300 to 650 nm and a higher EQE value were displayed in the FT2-based OSCs instead of the FT1-based OSCs, which is responsible for the enhanced Jsc and PCE of the FT2-based OSCs. Fig. 7 illustrates the morphologies of the active layers at the optimized blending ratios recorded by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Both FT1 and FT2 blending films give a homogeneous morphology with a root-mean-squared (RMS) surface roughness of 0.31 and 0.54 nm, respectively. Additionally, the isolated domain with an approximate size of 8–10 nm was observed for both blending films. The non-optimized phase domains here probably lead to serious recombination in the solar cells resulting in a low FF.

The X-ray diffraction patterns of FT1 and FT2 were carried out in order to investigate the molecular interactions in detail and are displayed in Fig. 8. A sharp diffraction peak was observed in the small angle region at 2θ = 4.7° and 4.3° for FT1 and FT2, respectively, corresponding to the inter-chain d spacing of 18.77 and 20.38 Å.9,14 As depicted, a shorter distance for the inter-chain spacing of FT1 was obtained due to the fact that the molecules of FT1 could interdigitate with each other easily to make the molecules pack closer from the side-chain edge.14 Furthermore, FT1 and FT2 show a flat and broad peak at ca. 2θ = 24°, which was ascribed to the interlayer π–π stacking of the main chain. Interestingly, another strong peak at 2θ = 18.01° was also observed for FT2 only rather than for FT1, indicating that FT1 and FT2 probably have different molecular packing modes caused by their different molecular conformations, which is one of the factors that can seriously affect the performance of the OSCs.

Hole mobility
To further investigate why FT2 exhibited better photovoltaic properties than FT1 in the SM-OSCs, the charge carrier mobility of both SMs were measured with the space charge limited current (SCLC) method in the hole-only devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au at an optimized blending ratio. The hole mobility can be estimated by the Mott–Gurney equation: J = (9/8)ε0εrμ(V/d3). Here, J is the current density, εr is the molecular dielectric constant, ε0 is the free-space permittivity (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), d is the thickness of the blend films (98 nm and 60 nm for FT1 and FT2, respectively), V = Vappl − Vbi, Vappl is the applied potential and Vbi is the built-in potential, which results from the difference in the work function of the anode and the cathode. Fig. 9 displays the J1/2–V curves for the hole-only FT1 and FT2-based devices. According to the above Mott–Gurney equation, the hole mobility of FT1 and FT2 were calculated to be 2.1 × 10−5 and 3.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The relatively higher hole mobility for FT2 is available to enhance the Jsc and PCE values of the FT2-based OSCs.

Conclusions
In conclusion, D–A–π–A–D type SMs, FT1 and FT2, with varied fused hetero-aromatic building centers were prepared. The effect of the fused hetero-aromatic building centers on the molecular conformation and photovoltaic performance of their SM-OSCs was observed. A more ordered inter-chain packing and broader absorption region from 350 to 670 nm were exhibited for FT2 when compared to FT1 due to its linear-shaped conformation and enlarged conjugation system. The maximum PCE of 1.71% and Jsc value of 5.78 mA cm−2 were obtained in the FT2-based cells, which are 1.7 times and 1.5 times the corresponding values for the FT1-based cells. Our results demonstrate that the fused hetero-aromatic building centers have a significant influence on the molecular conformation and the photovoltaic performance of SMs, which can be improved by altering the molecular conformation in the OSCs.
