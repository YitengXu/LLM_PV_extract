    , Accepted 9th July 2013First published on 9th July 2013AbstractPhotocorrosion-resistant tungsten trioxide (WO3) nanoflake arrays were synthesized via a new route which involves the dealloying of an electrodeposited Fe–W amorphous alloy and subsequent thermal treatment in air. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were employed to evaluate the surface capacitive characteristics. The interfacial capacitance measurements showed that the specific surface capacitance of the nanoflake WO3 electrode (5900 μF cm−2) is almost twice as large as that of the thermally oxidized plain WO3 electrode (2930 μF cm−2), displaying a dramatic increase in surface area. UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy revealed that the bandgap of the oxide film increased from 2.2 to 2.75 eV by gradually eliminating iron from the Fe–W compounds. The photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements of the nanoflake WO3 electrode exhibited a significant enhancement of the photocurrent of 2.25 mA cm−2 (about 2.5-fold higher than that of thermally oxidized plain WO3) at a bias potential of 1.5 V (vs. SCE) under light illumination of 100 mW cm−2. Mott–Schottky relation analysis demonstrated that the carrier concentration increased by an order of magnitude (3.19 × 1019vs. 1.28 × 1018 cm−3), implying that the enhanced PEC water splitting performance should be attributed to the unique nanoflake architecture, which offers improved light harvesting as well as efficient charge transportation.
Introduction
Water photoelectrolysis has been of considerable interest since 1972, when Fujishima and Honda pioneered water splitting using a titanium dioxide (TiO2) electrode.1 To achieve more efficient photoelectrolysis, a number of photocatalysts were developed in this emerging area.2 Most reports followed three important principles: (1) the bandgap (Eg) of the semiconductor must be larger than 1.23 eV, (2) the electron Fermi level (Fn) is more negative than that of hydrogen evolution, and the hole Fermi level (Fp) is more positive than that of oxygen evolution, and (3) the energy of the light input (hv) must be larger than the bandgap so that the electrons in the valence band (Ev) can be excited into the conduction band (Ec). Tremendous effort has been invested in the synthesis of new materials with suitable bandgaps to drive photoelectrochemical reactions,3 for example, triple junction semiconductors,4,5 semiconductor doping,6–9 multiple bandgap structures,10 catalyst/semiconductor structures,11–13 modification of electrode surfaces14,15 and so on.
Many comprehensive reviews have addressed the future challenges and new strategies in photoelectrolysis.16–18 Grätzel put forward a high efficiency solar cell based on dye-sensitized colloidal TiO2 films.19 Domen and co-workers proposed two-step-based Z-scheme structures by using an IO3−/I− redox couple.20 Tada demonstrated a CdS–Au–TiO2Z-scheme system which contained a vectorial electron transfer path.21 All of these inspiring works have a common feature, that nanostructured semiconductors were employed as the main component in the photoelectrolytic cell. As a matter of fact, nanostructured electrodes play a pivotal role in water splitting and they have been receiving increased attention.22 Obviously, the surface structure of the semiconductor has a great influence on its intrinsic properties. Generally speaking, in metal oxides the space charge layer extends to a few tens of nanometers.23 If half of the size (δ) of the nanocrystallite (δ/2) is comparable to or less than the space charge region, it is believed that charge collection and electron–hole pair separation would be more efficient.24
Thanks to its narrow bandgap (2.7 eV), WO3 is recognized as one of the most promising n-type semiconductors. It is resistant to photocorrosion in aqueous solution, and shows interesting properties both in visible light absorption and its good charge-transport abilities.25 To pursue a higher quantum efficiency, nanostructures are a favourable choice, and up to now, many WO3 nanostructures in the form of powders, nanowires, nanorods, nanobelts and nanochannels have been synthesized by chemical and physical techniques; these include vapour–liquid–solid,26 hydrothermally grown,27 anodization,28–30 chemical vapor and thermal vapor deposition,31,32 pulsed laser deposition,33 sol–gel techniques34–36 and so on. Among those nanostructures, vertically aligned WO3 nanopedal arrays demonstrate an incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency higher than 60% at a wavelength of 400 nm with a photocurrent of 1.43 mA cm−2 under AM 1.5G illumination.37 WO3 nanowire arrays, however, show a stable photocurrent of 0.8 mA cm−2 at a bias potential of 1.2 V (vs. SCE) in dilute sulfuric acid solution,38 demonstrating-morphology dependent photoelectrocatalysis by WO3 electrodes.
So far, precisely controlled conditions and complicated fabrication methods have been needed in the preparation of WO3-based photocatalysts for water decomposition. Dealloying was considered to be a simple, mild and economical method to fabricate nanostructures,39 such as nanoporous structures,40,41 nanowires,42 nanocages,43etc. As determined by their chemical potentials, the more active (less noble) component is selectively dissolved, while the other phase represents simultaneously a self-assembling action, which is controlled by atom diffusion and the materials' intrinsic properties. Using this method, nanoflake structures of metallic W were successfully prepared on sputtered Al–W alloy film.44 In this work, we propose a more facile and efficient way to synthesize nanoflake WO3 arrays by dealloying the as-electrodeposited Fe–W amorphous alloy, and the remarkable photoelectrochemical performance in water splitting of the novel nanostructure photoanode is reported and discussed.
Experimental details
Material preparation
Fe–W amorphous alloy was electrodeposited on commercial pure tungsten foil (15 × 20 mm, with purity of 99.99%) and ITO substrates (for UV-Vis tests only). The tungsten foil was first electrochemically polished in sodium hydroxide (1 M) and then ultrasonically cleaned in deionized water, acetone and alcohol, successively. A two-electrode cell consisting of graphite paper as the anode, and the above substrates as the cathode was designed, using an electrolyte containing 10.5070 g C6H8O7·H2O, 1.3900 g FeSO4·7H2O, 16.4930 g Na2WO4·2H2O and 100 mL H2O. All of the chemicals were of analytical purity grade and were used without any further purification.
Fe–W alloy was cathodically electro-deposited at a galvanic current of 0.03 A cm−2 for 75 s at 60 °C in a water bath. Under the given conditions, Fe–W alloy film with a thickness of about 1 μm was obtained. The dealloying process was carried out by immersing the as-deposited Fe–W film in dilute HNO3 solution (3.5 wt%) for 20 h at room temperature. The as-dealloyed film was then washed with deionized water and blow-dried. After that, samples were annealed in a furnace chamber at 500 °C for 3 h in air at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1.
All of the electrochemical and PEC measurements were implemented in a three-electrode cell, in which the as-annealed samples acted as the working electrode, platinum foil acted as the counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) acted as the reference electrode. The electrochemical signals were recorded using a Zahner IM6e universal electrochemical interface analyzer. For the PEC measurements, a Xenon arc lamp with a power intensity of 100 mW cm−2 served as the light source to simulate solar light; 0.5 M H2SO4 was used as the electrolyte. The front surface of the work electrode was sealed by epoxy with a leaving area of 1 cm2, and the ohmic contact was applied by sealing of silver paste on the underside of the specimen before applying the epoxy coating. The PEC water splitting performance of the photoanodes was characterized by measuring the current response rather than by gas collection.
Material characterization
The morphology of the WO3 nanoflakes before and after annealing was examined by FE-SEM (JEOL JSM-7001F) at 20 kV. The phase composition was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (D/max-2500, Cu Kα radiation) and Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw RM2000, 100–1200 nm). The optical transmittance and absorption properties were measured by a Varian Cary 5000 (USA) between 200 nm and 1000 nm with an integrating sphere.
Results and discussion
To understand the details of the phase transformation in the dealloying process and to make comparisons between WO3 electrodes prepared by different methods, XRD patterns were recorded, as shown in Fig. 1(a). One can see that the Fe–W alloy by the codeposition method was amorphous, which is in agreement with previous work.45 It is well known that tungsten can not be reduced in an aqueous environment, however, the introduction of some iron group elements in the periodic table, such as Fe, Co and Ni, can induce the codeposition of Fe–W, Co–W and Ni–W alloys.46,47 After the dealloying treatment, a new phase emerged (shown in Fig. 1(b)), which can be indexed to H2WO4·xH2O (16-0166). Interestingly, this finding is totally different from the dealloying of the Al–W alloy, where the product was proved to be metallic W.44 This difference might be related to the difference between the standard electrode potentials of the couples (W6+/W = −0.09 V; Al3+/Al = −1.68 V; Fe2+/Fe = −0.44 V) in acidic solution. Since iron is more thermodynamically stable than aluminium, tungsten tends to be more noble in the Al–W system than in the Fe–W alloy. After annealing at 500 °C in air, a monoclinic WO3 phase was obtained from the previous phase of tungsten acid (H2WO4·xH2O), as revealed in Fig. 1(c). For comparison, Fig. 1(d) and (e) list the XRD patterns of annealed pure W plate and the as-deposited Fe–W amorphous film, respectively. Compared to the monoclinic WO3 shown in Fig. 1(c), a slight left-shift of the peak position was recorded in Fig. 1(d), which can be well indexed to WO2.83 (36-0103). The significant influence of Fe in the alloy is presented in Fig. 1(e), in which only α-Fe2O3 was detected, indicating that Fe is oxidized more easily than W under the given annealing conditions.

To further confirm the phase composition of the electrodes, Raman spectroscopy was utilized. Fig. 2 (a) shows the typical pattern of monoclinic WO3. The peak at 269 cm−1 has previously been assigned to W4+ states,48 and the peaks at 710 and 807 cm−1 correspond to the O–W–O bending and stretching modes respectively.49 The thermal oxidation of plain W also resulted in monoclinic WO3 (shown in Fig. 2(b)). Similar to Fig. 1(e) of the annealed Fe–W alloy, Fig. 2(c) confirmed the presence of a large amount of α-Fe2O3. Only two weak peaks belonging to WO3 (133 and 807 cm−1, shown by the dashed lines) were detected, suggesting that α-Fe2O3 is the main component of the oxide film.

The morphologies and the crystallinity analysis of the as-deposited Fe–W film and the nanoflake WO3 electrodes via the dealloying process were characterized by FE-SEM and HRTEM. Fig. 3(a) depicts the microstructural images of the Fe–W alloy before and after dealloying. It is clear that small nanoflakes formed from the plain surface of the amorphous alloy (shown in the inset) after etching in HNO3 (3.5 wt%) for 20 h (see Fig. S1a, ESI†). This unique structure is probably attributed to the diffusion and rearrangement of tungsten atoms or its complexes after the iron was dissolved by acid. After being annealed at 500 °C for 3 h, a yellowish surface was observed, implying the dehydration of tungsten acid (H2WO4·xH2O). The nanoflakes were cross-linked and the thickness ranged from 10 to 30 nm. After annealing, the edge of each nanoflake was no longer sharp due to the thermal diffusion effect, which is shown in Fig. 3(b) (as also can be seen in Fig. S1b, ESI†). Fig. 3(c) shows the cross-section of the dealloyed film on the tungsten substrate. The thickness is about 1 μm under the given conditions. The thickness can be adjusted accordingly by controlling several factors, such as the current density and the duration of electro-deposition. There is no doubt that the thickness would increase with the deposition duration or current density, but this also results in a longer time for the complete elimination of iron to obtain the pure WO3. We obtained samples with thicknesses ranging from 1 to 10 μm (see Fig. S2, ESI†), and no difference in the morphology was observed (only nanoflakes). A TEM image of a single WO3 nanoflake is presented in Fig. 3(d) and the HRTEM image is shown in Fig. 3(e), in which the lattice fringes can be clearly seen. The SAED pattern shown in the inset of Fig. 3(d) can be indexed to the diffraction pattern of the monoclinic structure with a [010] diffraction zone axis.

Considering the existence of Fe in the alloy and the possible influence on the WO3 electrode, we have examined and compared the morphology of the oxidation-grown Fe–W alloy, as seen in Fig. 4. Only coarse grains formed on the surface, and no nanoflake structure was found, suggesting that the selective oxidation of Fe controls the film growth (refer to Fig. 1(e) and 2(b)).

Surface effects contribute significantly to the intrinsic properties of nanostructures. To investigate the effect of the nanoflake structure on the surface contribution, the double layer capacitive change of the electrode–electrolyte interface was evaluated.50 Voltammetric patterns at different scan rates for the nanoflake array electrode are shown in Fig. 5. The I–V curves were recorded at scan rates ranging from 0.5 to 10 mV s−1. The charging current at each sweep rate was measured at the middle of the scan range and was plotted as a function of the sweep rate. A linear dependence of the current on the sweep rate, with a positive intercept, was observed for the nanoflake WO3 electrode, as presented in Fig. 5(a). The positive intercept is probably related to the presence of ohmic drop effects introduced by grain boundaries inside the sample.51 The capacitance of each electrode–electrolyte interface was estimated by the equation: (1)where dV/dt is the voltage sweep rate (s), that is: C = I/s.(2)
 Fig. 5  Interface capacitive characteristics of the electrodes. (a) and (b) are cyclic voltammograms in the double layer region of the nanoflake and plain WO3 electrodes at different scan rates; (c) charging current as a function of the scan rate for the electrodes. 
For a pure capacitor, the response current follows eqn (2). At a porous electrode, however, the accessible C is dependent on s and is often potential-dependent for fundamental reasons connected with the structure of the double layer and ion adsorption. To eliminate these influences, we have limited the voltage range to between 0–0.05 V. The relative magnitude of the respective roughness factor, Rf, was calculated by assuming a value of 60 μF cm−2 for the capacitance of a smooth oxide surface (Rf = C/60).52 Therefore the average values of the capacitance and roughness factor calculated for the plain and nanoflake WO3 electrodes were 2930 μF cm−2 and 5900 μF cm−2, and 48.8 and 98.3, respectively, indicating that the specific surface area of the nanoflake WO3 electrode is twice as large as that of the plain WO3 electrode. Undoubtedly, a larger specific surface area would be beneficial to enhance the efficiency of light harvesting.
To determine the light absorption and the bandgap of the nanoflake WO3, UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy was used. Fig. 6(a) shows the following tendency in the absorption spectroscopy of WO3 on ITO substrate. As the duration of electrodeposition increased from 75 s to 5 min, the absorption of the wavelength band clearly increased. Unquestionably, the thicker Fe–W amorphous layer needs a longer period of time to eliminate all of the iron from the alloy, and it seems to be impossible to obtain pure WO3 when the electrodeposition lasts for more than 2 min. Under the given dealloying conditions, the dealloyed Fe–W film, which contains a large amount of Fe, exhibits dramatic absorption in the long-wave band, which is shown in plot 4. The FESEM pictures (see Fig. S2, ESI†) report the thicknesses of the samples: sample 1: 0.48 μm, sample 2: 0.6 μm, sample 3: 0.72 μm and sample 4: 1.2 μm. Curve 1 shows a clear absorption band below 400 nm (less than 3.1 eV), which most probably corresponds to a pure WO3 electrode. Fig. 6(b) shows the Tauc plots of samples 1, 2 and 3. The optical absorption coefficient α was evaluated by the relation: (3)where T is the spectral transmittance, d is the film thickness and R is the reflectance of the film, which was constantly assumed to be zero. The bandgap was determined by the Tauc formula: αhv = β(hv − Eg)n(4)where n equals 2 or 1/2 for the indirect or direct transitions, β is a constant and hv is the incident photon energy. The bandgap of WO3 for various kinds of nanostructures have been investigated, and are located within the range of 2.5 eV and 2.8 eV.24 As can be seen from Fig. 6(b), the extrapolation of the straight line to the linear portion of the curve to the X-axis gives the optical bandgap value. Curve 1 (Eg = 2.75 eV) should be related to pure WO3, while curves 2 (Eg = 2.4 eV) and 3 (Eg = 2.2 eV) confirm the presence of Fe2O3 in the film (proved by the XRD and Raman spectra in Fig. 1 and 2). It is clear, from Fig. 6(b), that the value of the bandgap decreases as the electro-deposition duration is prolonged, resulting in more efficient light harvesting in the long-wave band. Theoretically, the narrower bandgap favors light absorption, and is subsequently beneficial to the photoelectrochemical reaction. However, this is not always the case, as the polarization measurement gave an opposing trend, as shown in Fig. 7.

(b) Tauc plots of 1, 2 and 3 showing the reduction of the bandgap from 2.75 eV to 2.2 eV by increasing the electrodeposition time from 75 s to 4 min.

The photocurrent response of nanoflake WO3 and plain WO3 were compared in H2SO4 solution using a three-electrode setup with a Pt counter electrode. For the nanoflake WO3 electrode (curve 1-1 in Fig. 7(a)), the dark current remains unchanged at a very low level (near to zero) in the applied potential range. Once the light was turned on, the photocurrent rose immediately, and reached a maximum current density of 2.25 mA cm−2 with a bias potential of 1.5 V. Considering the competition of oxidation of water and SO4,53 we also recorded the current–potential curves in HClO4 solution, in which the nanoflake WO3 electrode exhibited a photocurrent of 2.3 mA cm−2 (almost ten times that of plain WO3, see Fig. S4, ESI†). Three main factors determine the photoresponse: (1) the quantity of electron–hole pairs stimulated by photons, (2) the electron transfer efficiency and (3) the rate of the redox reaction occurring on the surface of the electrode. These aspects depend on the bandgap of the semiconductor electrode, the width of the space charge region and the band edge position relative to the water redox reactions, respectively. In this work, nanoflakes can be easily depleted in the applied voltage range, which results in more efficient electron–hole pair separation. In order to verify the effect of the nanoflake structure, we compared the photoresponse of nanoflake and plain WO3 as shown in Fig. 7(a). It is clear that the photocurrent density of nanoflake WO3 (2.25 mA cm−2 at 1.5 V) is almost 2.5 times larger than that of plain WO3 (0.88 mA cm−2 at 1.5 V). By comparison, the nanoflake structure, prepared by this method, exhibits a much higher PEC performance than nanowires37 and nanoplates.38 This further verifies the morphology-dependent photoelectrocatalysis by WO3 electrodes.

Fig. 7(b) shows comparisons of the potentiostatic polarization of nanoflake WO3, plain WO3 and Fe–W alloy oxidation film electrodes with chopped illumination at 1.2 V. Though they all have a quick light response, the photocurrent exhibits significant differences. Curves 1-2, 2-2 and 3 gave stable photocurrent values of 1.75, 0.25 and 0.1 mA cm−2 for nanoflake WO3, plain WO3 and the air grown Fe–W alloy electrodes, respectively. Although enhanced photocurrent–voltage characteristics of the WO3/Fe2O3 nano-electrodes fabricated by sol–gel method has been reported (tested in 0.2 M Na2SO4, pH = 7.5),54 a significant decline was detected in our work. The loss of stability may be the main reasons for the composite electrode dissolving through the reaction between Fe2O3 and H+. The opposing results show that the surface structure of the material and the electrolyte environment have a great influence on the PEC performance. This is the prime motivation for why the dealloying method was utilized to in this work, to remove Fe.
To gain more insight on the dramatic rise of the photocurrent, and to achieve a better understanding of the correlation between the photocurrent and the specific nanoflake structure, the Mott–Schottky (M–S) relation was investigated and analyzed. The measurements were performed in 0.5 M H2SO4 at a frequency of 1 kHz. Fig. 8 shows the M–S plots of the nanoflake and thermal oxide WO3. From the C−2vs. V dependence, the potential Vfb and the donor concentration ND can be determined by fitting the theoretically-predicted Mott–Schottky equation: (5)where Csc, Vfb, ND, e, ε0, εsc, T and k are the capacitance of the space charge layer, the flat band potential, the uncompensated donor density, the electron charge, the vacuum permittivity (8.86 × 10−14 F cm−1), the dielectric constant of the semiconductor, the absolute temperature and the Boltzmann constant (1.381 × 10−23 J K−1), respectively. From the positive slope, it is apparent that both of the types of WO3 are n-type semiconductors. ND can be calculated from the slope of the plots, and the intercept to the potential axis gives the flat band potentials, which were estimated to be 0.085 V and 0.315 V (vs. SCE) for nanoflake and plain WO3, respectively. The flat band potentials calculated from the plots were approximately in line with the estimated potential from the onset of the photocurrent, as shown in curve 1-1 in Fig. 7(a), and the Vfb value of thermal oxide WO3 is close to that previously reported in the literature.55 Meanwhile, in the case of the nanoflake WO3 electrode, a significant negative shift of 0.23 V was observed. One plausible factor that may be responsible for the observed phenomenon is the adsorption of SO42− anions on the surface. This structure has a considerably high specific surface area, and the adsorption of ions would be more notable than for the plain WO3 electrode. Anion adsorption may have an influence on the distribution of charge carriers within the range of tens of nanometers, thus the space charge layer of WO3 was changed. Considering the dielectric constant εsc = 5.244 for WO3 thin film,56 the donor concentrations ND for nanoflake and thermal oxide WO3 calculated from the plot are 3.19 × 1019 cm−3 and 1.28 × 1018 cm−3, respectively. We attribute this evident enhancement of ND to the unique thin nanoflakes. Assuming the space-charge layers were generated at both sides of the nanoflakes, the relationship between the width (L) of the space-charge layer and the thickness (δ) of each nanoflake can be depicted by the formula: (6)
 Fig. 8  Mott–Schottky plots of the nanoflake WO3 electrode on tungsten film (a), and the plain WO3 electrode (b), with a frequency of 1 kHz and illuminated in 0.5 M H2SO4. 
As shown in Fig. 3(b), the thickness ranges from 10 to 30 nm; therefore the nanoflakes can be easily depleted in the applied voltage range, and more efficient electron–hole pair separation is expected.
There is another possibility, that trace amounts of iron were doped into the WO3 nanoflakes, which may enhance the ND and photoelectrochemical performance. To verify this possibility, we measured the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the nanoflake WO3 prepared on the W substrate. Fig. 9(a) shows the presence of W and O, as well as a small amount of C. Carbon is believed to have been incorporated during sample preparation and in the testing environment. However, no other impurity signals were detected, including Fe. As shown in the normalized high resolution W 4f spectrum (Fig. 9(b)), the W 4f5/2 and W 4f7/2 peaks are well indexed to WO3.57 The high resolution Fe 2p spectrum was also obtained (the corresponding part in the survey spectra is marked by the green rectangle), which is shown in Fig. 9(c). It can be seen that, in addition to the messy signal, no significant Fe 2p peaks were recorded, which indicates that iron was completely removed, and that the enhanced photoelectrochemical performance can be attributed to the novel nanoflake structure.

Stability is of the utmost importance for photoanodes. In this work, we investigated the stability by measurement of the photocurrent under continuous illumination in H2SO4 aqueous solution (0.5 M) with bias potentials of 0.8 V and 1.2 V (vs. SCE). WO3 was predicted to be thermodynamically stable to anodic photocorrosion when used as a photoanode in a water splitting cell because its anodic decomposition potential is 1.1 V more positive than the O2 evolution potential.58 Though the O2 evolution reaction continues to occur on the surface, the nanoflake WO3 electrode showed quite good stability against photocorrosion in acidic solution. Fig. 10 shows that the photocurrent dropped by 0.2 mA cm−2 at 0.8 V for 1 h, and still maintained a relatively high current value of 1.4 mA cm−2 after the voltage rose to 1.2 V. The electrode was taken through further I–V measurements to investigate the influence of photocorrosion, and no significant change to the photocurrent was observed (Fig. S3, ESI†).

After the potentiostatic polarization, FESEM images were examined for the same electrode. As can be seen in Fig. 11(a), no significant morphology change to the nanoflakes was observed.

The inset presents the smooth surface. Afterwards, this sample was immersed in H2SO4 (0.5 M) for another 3 h under illumination. Fig. 11(b) shows that only small corrosion pits were observed on the thinner nanoflakes (indicated by the red arrows), and that the thicker nanoflakes maintained the structural integrity. Whether Fe traces or microdefects (such as vacancy clusters) are the cause of this tiny change requires an in-depth investigation.
Conclusions
In summary, novel nanoflake WO3 array samples were successfully fabricated on tungsten and ITO substrates by electrodeposition and dealloying processes. The morphology, crystallinity, surface characteristics, light absorption, photoelectrochemical response and intrinsic carrier concentration were characterized and evaluated. It is safe to conclude that: (1) compared to the plain WO3 electrode, the specific surface capacitance of the nanoflake WO3 electrode (5900 μF cm−2) is almost twice as large as that of the thermally oxidized WO3 electrode due to the formation of the unique nanostructure with flake thicknesses of 10–30 nm. (2) The UV-Vis measurement showed the changes to the absorption spectra, the bandgap of oxide films increased with the absence of iron, and a dramatic enhancement of the photocurrent (2.25 vs. 0.88 mA cm−2 at 1.5 V) was also achieved under simulated AM 1.5 solar light in 0.5 M H2SO4 compared with plain WO3. Additionally, the nanoflake WO3 electrode endured photocorrosion upon prolonged photolysis. (3) The Mott–Schottky measurements revealed that the outstanding PEC performance should be ascribed to the upsurge in the carrier transportation from 1.28 × 1018 cm−3 to 3.19 × 1019 cm−3. The mechanism behind this is likely to originate from its excellent leaf-like inborn light harvesting as well as efficient charge separation due to the rapid depletion of its natively thin flakes. The preliminary analysis of the nanoflake WO3 may provide some valuable insights for further application in water splitting, though contingency problems such as the introduction and modification of catalysts and bench tests still need to be investigated further.
