1. Introduction
A capacitor is an electrical device used to store energy electrostatically in an electric field. Supercapacitors (SCs), also called electrochemical capacitors, have attracted significant interest during the past few decades. They store the most energy per unit volume or mass (energy density) among various capacitors, bridging the energy density gap between traditional capacitors (e.g. dielectric or electrolytic capacitors) and batteries (e.g. lead–acid or lithium ion batteries). Moreover, they can deliver or accept one or two orders higher energy per unit time (power density) than most batteries, be fully charged and discharged in seconds, and withstand tens of thousands of charge and discharge cycles (cycle life) without losing their original energy storage capacity.1–5 Thus, SCs support a broad spectrum of applications, ranging from consumer electronics, renewable energy storage systems to transport vehicles.1–5 The energy storage of SCs is based on two principles: electrical double-layer capacitance (EDLC) and pseudocapacitance. EDLC is electrostatic energy storage by separating charges at the interface between the surface of a conductive electrode and an electrolyte without faradaic reactions.1 Pseudocapacitance is faradaic electrochemical energy storage by fast reversible surface redox reactions, intercalation or electrosorption at or near the surface of some electrode materials.1 The energy storage by EDLC strongly depends on the available electrode surface area for ion adsorption and the conductivity and pore structure of electrodes, which affects the transport of electrons and ions. Thus, high-surface-area porous carbon materials, such as activated carbon, mesoporous carbon, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and graphene, are often used as electrodes to obtain higher EDLC.1,6 While carbon based EDL SCs can deliver high power density and achieve excellent cycling stability, they suffer from low energy density due to a limited specific capacitance of carbon materials.6 In contrast, pseudocapacitive materials such as transition metal oxides and hydroxides, such as RuO2, MnO2, Ni(OH)2, Co(OH)2, NiO, and Co3O4, nitrides, carbides, and conducting polymers, such as polyaniline, polypyrrole, and polythiophene, can deliver a much higher specific capacitance, as much as ten times that of an EDLC in a SC.1,7 However, most of the pseudocapacitive materials suffer from poor rate capability and low electrical conductivity.1 A common approach to improve the SC performance is to use composites of pseudocapacitive materials and carbon as electrodes.1,7
Conventional SCs have two-dimensional (2D) planar architectures with two metal plates as current collectors, two flat electrodes, one membrane charge separator, and electrolyte sandwiched together (Fig. 1a).1 They have shown great promise in large stationary applications (industrial grid storage), hybrid electric vehicles (electric buses and trains) and hand-held devices (power tools).1 The recent rapid advances in miniaturized consumer electronics, such as smart skins, implantable sensors, and stretchable devices, require the development of small-sized flexible energy storage units. However, conventional SCs based on liquid electrolytes are usually large in size, heavy in weight, and mechanically inflexible.5,8 The use of toxic and corrosive liquid electrolytes in conventional SCs requires bulky packaging to ensure their safety, which makes it difficult to produce small, light-weight and mechanically flexible SCs to meet the new requirements.4,5,8 Although progress has been made in developing flexible bulk SCs using solid electrolytes, they usually do not allow sweat and air from human body to pass through freely, thus they have limited wearability for potential applications in wearable electronics.5,8 In this context, a new family of SCs, fiber SCs with 1D fibers as electrodes, has emerged. Fiber SCs are shaped as 1D wires with diameters ranging from micrometers to millimeters, and they are generally small in size and light in weight. Because of their unique wire-shaped structure, they are highly flexible and can be woven or knitted into fabrics/textiles with excellent wearability. Such unique architectures also render great design versatility as compared to conventional SCs, since they can be fabricated into various desired shapes and located at different places.5,8 Further, compared with conventional SCs, fiber SCs have great potential to be easily integrated with other fiber based energy harvesting devices or sensors to form integrated multifunctional systems.

Particularly, fiber SCs have shown great application potential in two areas: (1) as micro-scale devices to complement or even replace micro-batteries in miniaturized electronics or microelectromechanical systems, (2) as macro-scale devices for flexible/wearable electronics or smart fabrics/textiles.4,5 In the area of micro-scale devices, the continued miniaturization of electronics requires small energy storage units.9–12 Micro-batteries, such as thin film lithium batteries, are the current solution. However, micro-batteries often suffer from sluggish charge and discharge processes, limited cycle life (generally several hundred to a few thousand cycles), and low power density.3 The limited lifetime is particularly problematic for some applications, such as implantable sensors, while the low power density hinders applications for situations that require high power. Fiber SCs may replace micro-batteries as small energy storage units in miniaturized electronics, while offering the beneficial characteristics of SCs.3 In the area of macro-scale devices, flexible energy storage units are needed for a wide spectrum of new applications, such as artificial skin, stretchable sensors, and smart textiles.4 A fully developed flexible energy storage device does not exist to date. Thus, fiber SCs have great application potential in this area because of their unique 1D architecture and mechanically flexible features, which enable them to be used in the form of yarns or fabrics, which can be integrated into smart textiles.4
Compared to conventional SCs, research on fiber SCs is still in its infancy. A common research goal is to develop energy storage devices in the form of flexible fibers while preserving or even surpassing their electrochemical characteristics as compared to conventional SCs. Although the technical requirements for fiber SCs in the two potential application areas are different in terms of energy, power, volume, fatigue resistance, stretchability and wearability, there are many similarities such as their device configuration, the choice of materials as electrodes and electrolytes, and the challenges in integrating multiple devices. In this tutorial review, we first introduce the basics of performance evaluation for fiber SCs, which provides a foundation to understand different research approaches and the diverse performance metrics reported in the literature. Next, we summarize the current state-of-the-art progress in fiber SC research with an emphasis on the device design and electrode fabrication. This is followed by the discussion on the integration of multiple fiber SCs and the combination with other energy harvesting or storage devices. Last, we present our perspectives on the future development of fiber SCs and highlight key technical challenges ahead. We hope that this tutorial review will excite more graduate students and researchers to work in this new field, and stimulate further research progress.
2. Basics of performance evaluation for fiber supercapacitors
The basic performance metrics for SCs include capacitance, energy and power. Capacitance is a term to describe the ability of a device to store an electrical charge. A SC with a two-electrode configuration including two active electrodes, a separator, an electrolyte and current collectors as illustrated in Fig. 1a can be treated as two capacitors in series. The total capacitance of the SC (Ccell) can be calculated using eqn (1), (1)where Cp and Cn are the capacitance of the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. For a symmetric SC with two identical electrodes, namely Cp = Cn, Ccell = 0.5Cp = 0.5Cn.

C
cell is usually determined by the charge and discharge test of SCs. It can be calculated from its constant current (CC) discharge curves according to eqn (2), (2)where i is the discharge current, and dV/dt is calculated from the slope of the measured CC discharge curve. Alternatively, Ccell can also be calculated from the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve of the SC using: (3)where Q is the total voltammetric charge obtained by the integration of the positive and negative sweeps (i(V) is the current) in a CV curve, v is the scan rate, and V(V = V+ − V−) represents the scanned potential window. Besides the total Ccell, the capacitance per unit mass, length, area, or volume (specific capacitance, Csp) of the SC is also an important performance metric. Csp of a SC can be calculated using eqn (4): (4)where Ci is the capacitance of one electrode. For a symmetric SC, Ci = Cp = Cn = 2Ccell. Bi can be the mass (giving gravimetric capacitance, F g−1), length (giving length capacitance, F cm−1), area (giving areal capacitance, F cm−2) or volume (giving volumetric capacitance, F cm−3) of one electrode (Bi) or two electrodes (2Bi). It should be noted that researchers have used different ways to calculate the weight, length, area and volume of SCs and their electrodes. Thus, it is important to carefully examine their specific methods in order to obtain accurate information about Csp.
Alternatively, electrode materials are also studied in a three-electrode electrochemical cell without assembling them into a two-electrode SC.13–15 The three-electrode cell consists of a working electrode (WE) containing the studied electrode materials, a reference electrode (e.g. normal hydrogen, silver chloride or saturated calomel electrodes with a stable and well-known electrode potential), and a counter electrode (e.g. a platinum wire). Csp of electrode materials can be determined using eqn (5): (5)where CWE is the capacitance of the WE measured in the three electrode electrochemical cell using either its CC discharge curve or CV curve and Bi is the mass (g), length (cm), area (cm2) or volume (cm3) of the studied electrode materials in the WE. Again, it should be noted that researchers have used different ways to calculate Bi. For instance, when a single fiber is dipped into an electrolyte solution as a WE in three-electrode tests, the mass of the fiber can be determined using a micro-balance as Bi for calculating its gravimetric capacitance. The length of the fiber (L) dipped in the electrolyte can be used to calculate its length capacitance. The fiber can be roughly considered as a cylinder. Thus, its surface area A (A = πDL) or volume Vol (Vol = πD2L/4) is used to calculate its areal and volumetric capacitance, respectively, where D is the diameter of the fiber.14
The energy stored in an assembled SC (E), energy per unit mass/length/area/volume (specific energy density, Ei), power of the SC (P), and power per unit mass/length/area/volume (specific power density, Pi) can be calculated using the following equations: (6) (7) (8) (9)where RESR is the equivalent series resistance of the SC, tdischarge is the discharge time and Bi should be the mass (g), length (cm), area (cm2) or volume (cm3) of the SC, which results in gravimetric (W h kg−1, W kg−1), length (W h cm−1, W cm−1), areal (W h cm−2, W cm−2), or volumetric (W h cm−3, W cm−3) energy density (Ei)/power density (Pi), respectively. It should be noted that the calculation methods of Bi are diverse in the existing literature. Some researchers reported Ei and Pi based on only the used capacitive materials, and Bi is the mass/area/volume of the capacitive materials used in the two fiber electrodes in the assembled SC.32,33,37 This often fails to reflect the realistic performance of the assembled SC because the mass/area/volume of the capacitive material typically accounts for a small portion of the total mass/area/volume of the entire assembled SC.16 In contrast, other researchers reported the performance based on the total mass/area/volume of the assembled SC including of two active electrodes, separators, and electrolytes.13,14,21,27,36 Generally, if the purpose is to report the overall performance of assembled SCs, it is recommended to calculate Ei and Pi based on the total mass/area/volume of assembled SCs.8
One important note for graduate students or researchers, who are new in the research of SCs, is that methodology to reliably evaluate a material's capacitive performance for use as an SC electrode is not well standardized using different techniques (e.g. three-electrode vs. two-electrode cells, different electrode thickness, CC discharge vs. CV curves, discharge current intensity and voltage scan rate) yielding widely varying results. The review article by Stoller and Ruoff and references therein may serve as an excellent starting point to understand this issue.16 Moreover, the performance of macro-scale SCs are usually evaluated by their gravimetric capacitance, energy and power densities.3 These parameters, which are based on unit mass, are applicable for evaluating fiber SCs in macro-scale applications. However, for micro-scale SCs, the mass of active materials is often very small, and the limited space is a key constraint.3 Thus, the volumetric or areal capacitance, energy and power densities based on volume or area are more meaningful evaluating parameters. In addition, the fiber SCs which can be charged and discharged many times are desired for practical applications, and thus the life cycles of SCs need to be considered. Furthermore, for wearable device applications, the performance stability of the fiber SCs under different mechanical bending, twisting, compressing, stretching or extreme environmental conditions (e.g. high or low temperature and moisture) is also an important performance metric.
Overall, various performance metrics discussed above indicate that the energy and power of fiber SCs are mainly determined by their cell capacitance (Ccell), operating voltage window (V) and cell equivalent series resistance (RESR). Current research efforts focus on increasing both Ccell and V while reducing RESR in order to achieve superior energy and power performances in a SC.1Ccell can be increased by improving the Csp of electrode materials and optimizing the structure of SCs. The V usually depends on the choice of electrode and electrolyte materials, as well as the structure of SCs. Smaller RESR can be achieved by using more conductive electrodes and electrolytes, as well as improving contacts between electrode materials and current collectors. These represent the main research approaches which will be discussed in the following sections.
3. Device designs of fiber supercapacitors
3.1. General device configurations
Three types of device configurations have been explored for fiber SCs as illustrated in Fig. 1b–d, including two parallel fibers, two twisted fibers and one coaxial fiber.5 All of them are evolved from the electrode/separator/electrode sandwiched structure used in the conventional 2D SCs (see Fig. 1a).1Fig. 1b shows that the device is composed of two parallel fibers supported on a planar substrate. Fiber SCs with such configuration can also be considered as thin film devices because of the use of the planar substrate. The parallel-fiber SC is easy to be scaled up by integrating more fiber electrodes on the planar substrate to meet specific power and energy requirement for micro-scale devices. For example, we have recently demonstrated the assembly of 20 fiber SCs on a 2 cm × 2 cm polymer substrates.14 However, the use of a planar substrate may restrict the potential application of fiber SCs. In contrast, the twisted and coaxial fiber configurations do not require a planar substrate. The stand-alone fibers are easier to be woven into textiles by themselves or co-woven with existing fabrics/textiles as wearable energy storage units. The twisted-fiber SCs can be produced by twisting two fiber electrodes together with a separator or solid state electrolytes between them, while the coaxial-fiber SCs are fabricated by layer-by-layer assembling of a core fiber electrode, a separator or solid state electrolyte, and an outer electrode layer. For the twisted-fiber SCs, there are limited direct contact areas between the two fiber electrodes. Upon bending of such fiber SCs, the two fiber electrodes could physically detach from each other, resulting in high internal resistance between them. What is more, if the separator or solid state electrolyte fails, the direct contact areas may lead to high leakage currents.5 In contrast, the coaxial configuration provides larger and more efficient interface areas between two electrodes.15 The coaxial configuration is also structurally more stable upon bending. However, it is technically more challenging to precisely control the layer-by-layer assembling of multiple layers on small diameter and long fibers, which could limit the manufacturing scalability of fiber SCs with the coaxial configuration. For all these three configurations, it is always important to avoid short circuit of the two electrodes in order to achieve an effective operation of the fiber SCs.
3.2. Electrolytes of fiber supercapacitors
An electrolyte is a critical component as it significantly influences the performance of a SC. A conventional macro-scale SC usually uses three types of liquid electrolytes: an aqueous electrolyte, an organic liquid electrolyte, or a room-temperature ionic liquid electrolyte. An aqueous electrolyte, such as H2SO4, renders a higher ionic conductivity (∼1 S cm−1) but a limited operating voltage window (<1.23 V). An organic liquid electrolyte and ionic liquid offer a wider operating voltage window typically higher than 2 V but provide a much lower ionic conductivity (∼10−2 S cm−1).8 For practical applications, bulky packaging is required to prevent the leakage of harmful liquid electrolytes, which inevitably hinders the potential applications of such SCs in small or flexible devices. Furthermore, it is difficult to pack liquid electrolytes along a long 1D fiber. Thus, the fiber SCs investigated so far seldom use liquid electrolytes.5
Solid electrolytes, including some glasses, crystals, ceramics, and organic gels, are special solids, which possess highly mobile ions. They offer many advantages over their liquid counterparts.12 Apart from providing mobile ions without a liquid, they can prevent undesirable short circuit of the two electrodes without the need for a membrane separator. In addition, some solid electrolytes can bind to fiber electrodes to enhance their mechanical flexibility. Solid electrolytes do not have the leakage problem experienced in liquid electrolytes. Thus, they can simplify the device packaging process and reduce device volume. Gel polymer electrolytes are salts (e.g. acids or alkalis in water, the Li salt in organic solution, and ionic liquid) dissolved in polymers (e.g. polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyethylene oxide (PEO)). They are attractive for fiber SCs, because of their high ionic conductivities (10−4–10−3 S cm−1),8 good mechanical strengths and stabilities under various environmental conditions, wide potential windows, low toxicity and low cost. Among various gel polymer electrolytes, proton conducting gel polymer electrolytes are the most popular.11 They are typically prepared by immersing a polymer matrix (i.e. PVA) in a proton donor solution (i.e. H2SO4 or H3PO4) with polar solvent. The PVA/H2SO4 and PVA/H3PO4 electrolytes have been extensively used in most current fiber SC studies.8
3.3. Electrodes for fiber supercapacitors
As discussed in Section 2, a key approach to increase the energy density of the fiber SCs is to develop fiber electrodes with high Csp. Furthermore, fiber electrodes with robust mechanical properties are needed for flexible/wearable applications. Considerable research efforts have been dedicated to developing such fiber electrodes. The key findings are summarized in Table 1. Researchers have used diverse methods to report the capacitive performances of fiber electrodes, which make it difficult to directly compare some results in the literature. In general, Csp of electrode materials is obtained using either a three-electrode cell or an assembled two-electrode SC.13–15,17–21,25–39 Many studies have reported the energy and power density of two-electrode SCs,13–15,17,20,21,25,27–29,31–33,36,37 even though the calculation methods of gravimetric/length/areal/volumetric energy and power densities are not always consistent. Some consider the two-electrode SCs as a whole including both active electrodes, separators, and electrolytes, while others take into account only two active electrodes in their calculations. We have marked the different methods used in Table 1 for easy comparison. Using the device structural information, such as mass, length, area, and volume, we converted the performance data of the original references to gravimetric/length/areal/volumetric energy and power densities for easier comparison. In some cases, such information was missing in the original references, thus only partial performance data are listed in Table 1.

For conventional SCs, electrode materials can be synthesized in the form of bulk powder or thin film, while the synthesis of fiber electrodes is constrained by the geometrical and mechanical flexibility requirement of the fibers. Two common issues affect the design of fiber electrodes. The first issue is whether a metal current collector is needed? Metal wires with high conductivity can be used in fiber SCs and substitute the role of metal plates in conventional SCs. Metal wires are heavy and do not directly contribute to the capacitive energy storage, which may lower the gravimetric energy/power density of fiber SCs. Alternatively, conductive, lightweight, and flexible carbon-based wires such as graphene fibers and CNT fibers can be used as current collectors instead of metal wires. Moreover, carbon-based wires can also serve as active materials and contribute to EDLC. The second issue is whether pseudocapacitive materials, such as metal oxides, metal hydroxides and conductive polymers, should be used to increase the capacitance and energy density of fiber SCs. The increase in energy density by using pseudocapacitive materials often comes at the price of lower power density, poorer rate capability and shorter cycle life because redox reactions in the bulk of pseudocapacitive materials are diffusion-controlled, resulting in sluggish reaction kinetics and low Coulombic efficiency.1 Thus, nanoscale engineering of pseudocapacitive materials has become a major method for designing fiber electrodes. In the following sections, we first review fiber electrodes with metal wires as current collectors. Next, fiber electrodes without metal wires are discussed in two sections, where one focuses on all-carbon based fibers and the other concentrates on composite fibers containing pseudocapacitive materials.

3.3.1 Fiber electrodes with metal wires as current collectors. 
Metal wires, such as Au, Pt, Ni, and Ti, or metal-coated plastic wires, have good mechanical strength as well as excellent conductivities. Thus, they have been used as conductive substrates to deposit a wide range of capacitive materials, such as metal oxides, carbon materials and conductive polymers to create fiber electrodes,7,8 in which the metal or metal-coated wires mainly serve as current collectors. In this section, we discuss them in three sub-sections according to the key capacitive materials used, including pseudocapacitive materials, carbon materials, and pseudocapacitive material–carbon composites.
3.3.1.1 Pseudocapacitive materials as capacitive materials. 
In 2011, Wang's group at Georgia Institute of Technology in the USA reported the first fiber SC with a twisted fiber configuration made from ZnO nanowire electrodes.17 The device was fabricated by entangling a flexible poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) plastic wire covered with ZnO nanowires around a Kevlar fiber covered with Au-coated ZnO nanowires (Fig. 2a–c). To improve the charge collection ability of the PMMA wire and seed the hydrothermal synthesis of ZnO nanowires, a thin Au film was coated onto the PMMA wire (Fig. 2b). To improve device capacitance, MnO2 with large pseudocapacitance was further coated onto the ZnO nanowires, yielding a specific capacitance of 2.0 mF cm−2 (0.01 mF cm−1) in the KNO3 aqueous electrolyte and 2.4 mF cm−2 (0.2 mF cm−1) in the PVA/H3PO4 gel electrolyte. The assembled solid-state fiber SC showed an energy density of 2.7 × 10−8 W h cm−2 and a power density of 1.4 × 10−5 W cm−2. Because of the twisted-fiber configuration, the interface contact area between the two fiber electrodes is small and the effective surface area of the structure is also low. Thus its capacitive performance in this work is not as good as those reported in more recent results.5 Nevertheless, this pioneering work successfully opened up a new research area of fiber SCs.

Thomas et al. at University of Central Florida in the United States designed a coaxial fiber electrode by depositing MnO2 onto Au/Pd-coated CuO nanowire arrays on a copper cable (Fig. 2d).13 The CuO–AuPd–MnO2 core–shell nanowire electrode showed a specific capacitance up to 1376 F g−1 (calculated based on the mass of MnO2) in the KOH aqueous electrolyte in three-electrode tests. A coaxial fiber SC was assembled by placing an outer tubular electrode on an inner electrode (both pre-coated with the PVA/KOH electrolyte) with a porous separator (Fig. 2e). It showed an energy density of 0.55 mW h cm−3 and a power density of 413 mW cm−3. The high performance can be attributed to the unique architecture of the fiber, in which Au/Pd-coated CuO nanowire arrays with a large area and a high aspect ratio rendered more open space for the accessibility of the electrolyte and enhanced electrochemical-active sites for the reversible redox reactions while sharply reducing the internal resistance between AuPd and MnO2. Moreover, such coaxial-fiber configuration helps to decrease the internal resistance compared to the twisted fiber configuration. More importantly, this work provides a promising approach to transmit electricity and store energy at the same time by integration of an electrical cable and an energy storage device into one unit.
3.3.1.2 Carbon materials as capacitive materials. 
Compared with metal oxides, carbon materials such as activated carbon, CNT, and graphene have several advantages as capacitive materials, including a higher specific surface area, better electrical conductivity, higher rate capability and better cycling stability. Several research groups have reported fiber electrodes using different carbon materials as capacitive materials together with metal or metal-coated wires as current collectors.
Harrison's group at Brunel University in UK reported a coaxial fiber SC by sequentially depositing Chinese ink (carbon nanoparticles) as active material, a gel electrolyte, and silver paint onto a stainless steel wire via dip-coating.18 A moderate specific capacitance of 3.18 mF cm−2 (0.1 mF cm−1) was demonstrated. Compared to the Chinese ink, graphene based materials of 2D atomic layer carbon sheets are more attractive as capacitive materials because of their large specific surface area, high electrical conductivity, and good mechanical performance.6 Shi's group at Tsinghua University in China electrochemically deposited reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets on Au wires, forming fiber electrodes.19 A solid-state fiber SC was assembled using two parallel rGO-coated Au-wires with the PVA/H3PO4 gel electrolyte. It showed an enhanced specific capacitance up to 6.49 mF cm−2 (0.102 mF cm−1) and long cycle life (94% capacitance retention after 2000 charge and discharge cycles). More recently, Zou's group at Peking University in China has explored another type of low-cost commercial pen ink as a capacitive material for fiber SCs.20 A tri-helix structured fiber SC was assembled using two pen-ink-coated metal wires and one spacer wire in the H2SO4 electrolyte (Fig. 2f), which was sealed in a plastic tube. It showed a high capacitance of 19.5 mF cm−2 (0.504 mF cm−1), an energy density of 2.70 × 10−6 W h cm−2, and a power density of 9.07 mW cm−2.20 The carbon nanoparticles in the pen ink (Fig. 2g) remained robust even after 15000 charge–discharge cycles. The capacitance of the fiber device dropped only slightly even bending at 180° and 360°, demonstrating good flexibility. This work proposed the use of a helical plastic spacer wire to separate two fiber electrodes, which can avoid direct contact between two fiber electrodes and prevent the assembled SC from short circuiting during bending. However, the use of a liquid electrolyte is undesirable, especially for wearable device applications because of the high risk of electrolyte leakage.
3.3.1.3 Pseudocapacitive material–carbon composites as capacitive materials. 
Carbon materials alone often have limited EDLC, while pseudocapacitive materials alone have higher specific capacitance but poor conductivity. An efficient approach to obtain high performance electrode materials is to combine carbon with pseudocapacitive materials. Kim's lab at Hanyang University in Korea produced a weavable, sewable, and knottable composite yarn by scrolling hundreds of layers of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)-infiltrated multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) sheets (Fig. 2h and i).21 The biscrolled PEDOT–MWCNT composite yarn can preserve the good mechanical strength (367 MPa) and high modulus (5.9 GPa) of pure MWCNT yarn.21 Using the composite yarn as capacitive material and a Pt wire as a current collector, the fiber electrode demonstrated a large specific capacitance of 73 mF cm−2 (179 F cm−3, 0.46 mF cm−1). A fiber SC assembled using two fiber electrodes (5 cm in length) with the PVA/H2SO4 electrolyte (10 μm in thickness) can be woven into a glove, and showed a power density of 40 W cm−3, an energy density of 1.4 mW h cm−3, and a long cycle life (99% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles). The good performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of PEDOT with large pseudocapacitance and highly conductive MWCNTs as well as the hierarchal structure of the composite yarn, which provided a continuous pathway for both ion and electron transport from the surface to the center of fiber, as well as a good adhesion and low contact resistance between the yarn and the Pt wire. This study represents an excellent example of realizing high performance fiber SCs by careful tailoring of fiber structure.
All the fiber SCs discussed in this section used metal wires or metal-coated plastic wires as current collectors. These metal wires took up a considerable portion of the total weight and volume of the assembled fiber SCs and contribute little to the total capacitance by both EDLC and pseudocapacitance, which inevitably compromised the gravimetric and volumetric energy/power density of the assembled fiber SCs. Thus, researchers have tried to minimize the usage of metal wires as current collectors in order to achieve better performances.


3.3.2 All-carbon fiber electrodes without metal wires. 
In recent years, a wide range of 1D carbonaceous fibers, including common carbon fiber, carbon nanotube (CNT) fiber, and graphene fiber, have been successfully fabricated by wet-spun, dry-spun, or hydrothermal methods.22–24 These carbonaceous fibers have low densities, excellent conductivities and mechanical properties. They may serve as both capacitive materials and current collectors to replace the above-mentioned metal or metal-coated wires in fiber SCs. In this section, we will discuss all-carbon fiber electrodes, which comprised of various carbon materials. Fiber electrodes containing a single type of carbon were firstly examined, followed by carbon–carbon composite electrodes containing two different types of carbon. Last, we will introduce heteroatom-doped carbon electrodes.
3.3.2.1 Single type of carbon as capacitive material. 
All-carbon fiber SCs discussed in this part employed a single type of carbon, such as graphene or CNTs, as capacitive material without metal wires as current collectors. Although the overall capacitive performance is moderate, several all-carbon fiber SCs show excellent stretchability, which is an important requirement for some wearable applications, such as smart textiles.
Qu's group at Beijing Institute of Technology in China explored all-graphene core–sheath fibers consisting of an rGO fiber as the core with a sheath of 3D porous graphene network,25 which inherits the intrinsic conductivity and mechanical flexibility of rGO fiber in combination with highly exposed surfaces of graphene sheets. The twisted fiber SC by intertwining two all-graphene fibers in the PVA/H2SO4 electrolyte showed a capacitance of 1.7 mF cm−2 (27.1 μF cm−1, 40 F g−1), an energy density of 1.7 × 10−7 W h cm−2, and a power density of 1 × 10−4 W cm−2. Interestingly, using such all-graphene fiber electrodes, the compressible and stretchable spring-like fiber SC can be easily fabricated by wrapping a “wet” fiber SC around a glass rod. The fiber SC can also be integrated into textile structures while maintaining its electrochemical performances upon repeated bending. However, the overall energy storage performances of the SC are not satisfactory. This can be attributed to the poor electrical conductivity (12 S cm−1) and a relatively small surface area (<100 m2 g−1) of all-graphene fibers. Thus, it is desirable to develop new graphene fibers with both high conductivity and a large specific surface area for high-performance SCs.
Compared to graphene fibers, MWCNT fibers have a high conductivity of up to 103 S cm−1 and a tensile strength of up to 1.3 GPa.26 Peng's group at Fudan University in China spun chemical-vapor-deposition-grown MWCNT arrays into aligned MWCNT fibers and subsequently assembled a fiber SC by twisting two MWCNT fibers with the PVA/H3PO4 gel electrolyte.26 However, the device using MWCNT fibers showed a low capacitance of 0.006 mF cm−1 because of the low specific surface area of the MWCNT fibers. Li's group at Donghua University of China reported another twisted fiber SC using MWCNT fibers attached on an elastic synthetic fiber (spandex) (Fig. 3a–c).27 Two MWCNT fibers spun from a vertically aligned CNT array were twined together with the PVA/H2SO4 electrolyte to produce a fiber SC. The straight fiber SC was then “glued” on the pre-strained spandex fiber with the additional gel electrolyte as an adhesive. After the pre-strain on the spandex fiber was released, a sinusoidal buckling fiber SC with stretchability on the spandex fiber was formed. Such a fiber SC had a capacitance of 4.28 mF cm−2 (11.4 F cm−3), a power density of 4.93 × 10−4 W cm−2 (1.32 W cm−3), and an energy density of 2.26 × 10−7 W h cm−2 (6.01 × 10−4 W h cm−3).27 It was able to undergo a large cyclic tensile strain of 100%. Although the device capacitance is moderate, this work represents an excellent demonstration of fiber-like stretchable energy devices.

The insets are photographs of the fiber SC stretched at tensile strains of 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100%.29 
Considering that the twisted fiber configuration often leads to a low contact area between the electrolyte and the electrode,27 some efforts have been directed towards the development of all-carbon coaxial fiber SCs.28,29 Peng et al. designed a coaxial all-CNT fiber SC with aligned CNTs as its core, CNT sheets as its outer layer, and a polymer gel electrolyte sandwiched between the two CNT electrodes (Fig. 3d and e).28 The unique coaxial structure reduces the contact resistance between the two CNT electrodes, leading to a capacitance of 8.66 mF cm−2 (32.09 F cm−3, 29 μF cm−1, 59 F g−1), much higher than that of the fiber SC (4.5 F g−1) by twisting two CNT fibers together. Such a coaxial fiber SC showed an energy density of up to 1.88 W h kg−1 and a power density of up to 755.9 W kg−1. In addition, the fiber SC showed some stretchability with 20% capacitance decrease after being stretched by 10% for 75 cycles (Fig. 3f). This work provides a new concept of stretchable energy devices in single fiber format by using strong and conductive CNT fiber electrodes. In order to further improve the stretchability of fiber SCs, Peng et al. sequentially proposed another coaxial fiber design with CNT sheets as active materials and a rubber fiber as a supporting substrate.29 As shown in Fig. 3g, aligned CNT sheets are sequentially wrapped on an elastic rubber fiber with the polymer gel electrolyte. The use of aligned CNT sheets renders high flexibility, good tensile strength, high electrical conductivity and mechanical stability. As a result, the fiber SC demonstrated a capacitance of 20 F g−1, an energy density of 0. 515 W h kg−1, and a power density of 421 W kg−1. Due to the stretchable nature of both rubber fiber substrates and the gel electrolyte, the fiber SC is flexible and easily stretched by 100% without an obvious decrease in the structural integrity (Fig. 3h and i). The high stretchability and specific capacitance have been simultaneously achieved by designing the coaxial structure that favors high contact areas between the electrode and electrolyte in addition to the excellent properties of aligned CNT sheets.
3.3.2.2 Carbon–carbon composites as capacitive materials. 
CNTs or graphene fibers can function as both capacitive materials and current collectors. However, they still suffer from a relatively small accessible surface area and poor porosity, caused by bundling of nanotubes or stacking of graphene sheets.25–29 To improve their porosity and consequently increase the accessible surface area, researchers have explored carbon–carbon composite fiber electrodes by effectively incorporating two different types of carbon materials into a composite fiber.30–32 Carbon materials with a large-surface-area, such as graphene, mesoporous carbon, and activated carbon, have been incorporated into conductive CNT fibers.30–32
Peng et al. introduced graphene (theoretical specific surface area up to 2675 m2 g−1) into the aligned MWCNTs by a dip-coating method and subsequently produced the rGO–MWCNT composite fibers by a dry-spun method.30 Due to the strong π–π interactions between MWCNTs and rGO sheets, rGO sheets serve as effective bridges to improve the charge transport inside the composite fiber, while MWCNT fibers can reduce the stacking of rGO sheets and preserve large useful surface area of rGO sheets. Thus, the fiber SC by twisting two composite fibers exhibited a significantly-enhanced capacitance of 4.97 mF cm−2 (27.1 μF cm−1, 31.5 F g−1) compared with the bare CNT fiber (0.90 mF cm−2, 5.1 μF cm−1, 5.83 F g−1), without obvious capacitance decrease after 5000 charge–discharge cycles. Alternatively, ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) particles with a large specific surface area of up to 1014 m2 g−1 were also infiltrated into the aligned MWCNTs by the dip-coating method.31 By further rolling the OMC particles modified MWCNT sheets (Fig. 4a and b), the OMC–MWCNT composite fibers with mesoporous structures were formed, while maintaining high surface area. The assembled twisted fiber SC with the PVA/H3PO4 electrolyte showed an energy density of 1.77 × 10−6 W h cm−2 (8.55 × 10−8 W h cm−1), a power density of 3.2 × 10−2 mW cm−2 (1.55 × 10−3 mW cm−1), and a specific capacitance of 39.7 mF cm−2 (1.91 mF cm−1), about 20 times that of the SC with bare MWCNT fibers (1.97 mF cm−2, 0.017 mF cm−1). Such devices based on composite fibers have a long cycle life (>85% capacitance retention after 500 charge–discharge cycles) and can be woven into textile structures without compromising their performances. The above work demonstrates the advantage of composite carbon fibers, which combine the structure and property advantages of the two types of carbon components.

Compared to MWCNTs, single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with a single layer of rolled graphene in the form of cylinder have better capacitive performances due to their larger specific surface areas and EDLC.5 Wei's group at National Nanoscience and Technology Centre in China thermally treated the wet-spun chitosan–SWCNT composite yarn to produce activated carbon–SWCNT (C–SWCNT) composite fibers (Fig. 4c).32 The activated carbon was formed on the SWCNT surface by carbonization of chitosan during thermal treatment (Fig. 4d–g),32 which not only provides a relatively large specific surface area of 286 m2 g−1 with rich mesoporosity for efficient ion transport and energy storage, but also improves the yarn conductivity for fast electron transport. The assembled fiber SC using two parallel composite fiber electrodes with the PVA/H2SO4 electrolyte showed a specific capacitance of 37.1 mF cm−2 (48.5 F cm−3, 74.6 F g−1), much higher than that of the chitosan/SWCNT yarn electrode (7.1 mF cm−2), an energy density of 3.29 μW h cm−2 (3.7 mW h cm−3), a power density of 3.36 mW cm−2 (3840 mW cm−3), and high cycle life (98.5% capacitance retention after 10000 charge–discharge cycles). The synergistic effect of SWCNTs and activated carbon in the composite yarn greatly improves the porous structure and electron transport of the yarn, thus leading to the good performance.
Graphene fibers are less conductive (1–100 S cm−1) than CNT fibers.30 To overcome this drawback of graphene fibers, Gao's group at Zhejiang University in China developed an rGO–CNT composite and the sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) core–sheath fiber by a coaxial wet-spinning assembly method (Fig. 4h),33 in which the rGO–CNT composite formed the core of the fiber and CMC made up the sheath (Fig. 4i and j). The incorporation of CNT onto the surfaces of rGO in the composite fiber not only separates the adjacent rGO sheets (Fig. 4j) and hence increases the specific area of the fibers, but also enhances the conductivity of the rGO fiber. The composite fiber electrode in the PVA/H3PO4 electrolyte showed a specific capacitance of 177 mF cm−2 (158 F cm−3, 5.3 mF cm−1), much higher than those of the yarn electrodes using either CNTs (47 mF cm−2, 42 F cm−3, 1.4 mF cm−1) or rGO (127 mF cm−2, 114 F cm−3, 3.8 mF cm−1). The assembled solid-state twisted fiber SC showed a high energy density of 3.84 μW h cm−2 (3.5 mW h cm−3).
3.3.2.3 Heteroatom-doped carbon as capacitive material. 
In addition to the large specific surface area and appropriate pore structure, introducing surface functional groups or heteroatoms (B, N or P) on the carbon surface has also been considered as an effective way to improve the specific capacitance of carbon materials by enhancing surface wettability, inducing surface faradaic redox reaction, and improving conductivity.1 Our group at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore has recently developed a hierarchically-structured carbon composite fiber made of an interconnected network of aligned SWCNTs with interposed nitrogen-doped reduced GO sheets.14 The N-doped carbon-based composite fibers were produced using a silica capillary column as a hydrothermal micro-reactor (Fig. 5a–c). The resultant fibers have large surface areas of 396 m2 g−1 with mesoporous structures and a high electrical conductivity of 102 S cm−1 as well as 3.1 at% N doping. Due to these unique attributes, they exhibited a specific capacitance up to 305 F cm−3 in H2SO4 electrolytes in three-electrode tests and 300 F cm−3 with PVA/H3PO4 electrolytes in two-electrode tests. This is one of the highest volumetric capacitance values among all reported porous carbon materials. Two parallel fibers were assembled into a fiber SC with the PVA/H3PO4 electrolyte as shown in Fig. 5d. The fiber SC showed an energy density of ∼6.3 mW h cm−3 (comparable to that of a 4 V–500 μA h thin-film lithium battery) while maintaining a power density of 1085 mW cm−3, which was more than two orders of magnitude higher than that of the battery (Fig. 5e). In addition, the fiber SC showed a long cycle life (93% device capacitance retention after 10000 charge and discharge cycles) and continued working without performance loss, even after bending hundreds of times. As they remain flexible and structurally consistent over their length, the fibers can also be woven into a crossing pattern, which can be made into clothing for wearable devices in smart textiles. Further, the fiber SCs show great potential in bridging the energy density gap between microbatteries and micro-SCs for miniaturized portable electronics.

(d) The inset shows an assembled fiber SC.14 (e) Energy and power densities of the micro-SC compared with commercially available state-of-the-art energy storage systems. 


3.3.3 Pseudocapacitive material–carbon composite fiber without metal wires. 
Despite the high power density and long cycle life demonstrated by fiber SCs using all-carbon fiber electrodes, their energy density is still limited because of the relatively low specific capacitance of carbon materials.1 For conventional SCs, it has been regarded as an effective approach to improve capacitance and energy density by directly incorporated pseudocapacitive materials, such as metal oxides and conductive polymers, into carbon electrodes. A similar approach has also been explored for fiber SCs.5 Although the energy density can be generally increased, pseudocapacitive electrodes often lead to lower power density and shorter cycle life due to the sluggish Faradic reactions.6 In this section, we will discuss two groups of pseudocapacitive material–carbon composite fiber electrodes: conductive polymers and metal oxides. The key difference between the composite fiber electrodes discussed in this section and those in Section 3.3.1 is that no metal wires were used. Thus, different approaches have to be used to design and fabricate highly conductive composite fibers without metal wires in order to obtain high performance fiber SCs.
3.3.3.1 Conducting polymer–carbon composite fiber electrode. 
Conductive polymers, such as polyaniline (PANI) and polypyrrole (PPy), have been introduced into different carbonaceous fibers, including CNT fibers and graphene fibers, to increase their capacitance. Wei et al. deposited conducting PANI nanowire arrays on a CNT yarn by in situ polymerization (Fig. 6a).34 In the resulting PANI–CNT composite yarn, CNT yarn served as both a current collector and a high toughness substrate to support PANI nanowires, while PANI nanowire arrays provided high pseudocapacitance. A fiber SC assembled using two-ply composite fibers in a gel electrolyte showed a capacitance of 38 mF cm−2, which was 16-fold higher than that of the fiber SC based on pure CNT yarns (2.3 mF cm−2). It also retained 91% of its initial capacitance after 800 charge and discharge cycles, and the good cyclability was attributed to the mechanical reinforcement by CNTs and the well-defined architecture of the PANI nanowire arrays. The capacitance of the yarn SC changed very little even when the bending angle approached 180°. Besides, Qu et al. synthesized a PPy coated rGO composite fiber by a wet-spinning strategy.35 The composite fiber had a conductivity of 144 S m−1 and a tensile strength up to 80 MPa, much higher than the pure PPy fiber by wet-spinning (20–25 MPa). A fiber SC using such composite fibers in the PVA/H2SO4 electrolyte showed a capacitance of 107.2 mF cm−2 (72 F g−1), much higher than that of the SC based on rGO fiber, and an energy density of 9.7 μW h cm−2.35 During the bending tests, the device also demonstrated high structural and electrochemical stability.

3.3.3.2 Metal oxide–carbon composite fiber electrode. 
MnO2 is a good pseudocapacitive material widely used in SCs due to its high specific capacitance, low cost, and environmental friendliness.7 Zhou's group at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in China synthesized a MnO2–carbon core–shell fiber by dipping a common carbon fiber into a stirred 0.1 M KMnO4–0.1 M Na2SO4 solution (Fig. 6b).36 A parallel fiber SC with the PVA/H2SO4 electrolyte showed a capacitance of 2.5 F cm−3 and a moderate energy density of 0.22 mW h cm−3. Following this work, Gao et al. from the same institution used a “conductive wrapping” method to coat PPy onto MnO2–carbon fibers (Fig. 6c).37 The additional conductive PPy layer not only provided a faster charge/ion transfer network to connect MnO2 but also protected the MnO2 nanoflakes from corrosion in an acidic electrolyte. A fiber SC using two parallel PPy–MnO2–carbon fibers showed an enhanced capacitance of 69.3 F cm−3 and an energy density of 6.16 mW h cm−3, much better than those of fiber SCs based on two MnO2–carbon fibers. Alternatively, using an electrochemical deposition method, MnO2 nanoparticles were also deposited onto rGO fibers, and the resultant composite fiber electrodes exhibited much better capacitive performance compared to carbon electrodes without MnO2.38 Other than MnO2, Shen et al. grew ZnCo2O4 nanowire arrays on a carbon fiber, forming composite fibers.39 A parallel fiber SC on a flexible polyethylene terephthalate substrate with the PVA/H3PO4 electrolyte showed a specific capacitance of 650 mF g−1.

4. Integration of fiber supercapacitors
As micro-scale devices, individual fiber SCs could readily meet the relatively small energy and power requirements in microelectronic circuits. However, as macro-scale devices for flexible and wearable applications, it is necessary to integrate multiple fiber SCs in order to meet the specific energy and power demands. Furthermore, it is also attractive to integrate fiber SCs with other fiber based energy harvesting devices on a single fiber to develop integrated fiber systems to enable both energy scavenging and storage. Here, we first summarized the latest developments in integrating multiple fiber SCs to expand their operating voltage and energy density, followed by their integration with other fiber based energy harvesting devices.
4.1. Integration of multiple fiber supercapacitors
Fiber SCs using gel electrolytes have generally shown good flexibility and mechanical strength, thus they can be easily integrated into fabrics, which promises potential applications in garment devices, biomedical and antimicrobial textiles, and personal electronics.40 Although most studies have shown integration of only a limited number of fibers, the results suggest that it is possible to integrate more fiber SCs into complex SC modules to meet a variety of operating voltage and energy capacity demands. We will discuss the integration approaches used for the three types of fiber SC configurations in the following three sections, respectively.

4.1.1 Integration of parallel fiber SCs. 
The parallel-fiber SCs can be scaled up by adding more fiber electrodes connected in series or in parallel to increase the total energy or voltage of the integrated devices. Zhou et al. integrated three individual fiber SCs made of two MnO2–carbon core–shell fibers with a triboelectric generator to form a self-powered system, which can power a liquid crystal display (LCD) or a LED (Fig. 7a and b).36 Shen et al. fabricated flexible fiber SCs with different numbers (2, 6, 10, 14, 20 and 30) of ZnCo2O4 nanowire–carbon composite fibers on a polymer substrate.39 The capacitance exhibited a significant increase with the increase of fiber numbers due to the complicated effect of distributed capacitance.36 We have recently integrated multiple N-doped rGO/SWCNT fibers (up to 40 fibers, each fiber length: 1 cm) on a 2 cm × 2 cm flexible polymer substrate (Fig. 7c and d). The results showed that the overall capacitance of the assembled SC module increased linearly with the number of fibers, suggesting good scalability. Three fully charged fiber SCs assembled in series can power an ultraviolet photodetector based on TiO2 nanorods without any external bias voltage (Fig. 7e and f). The planar-integrated fiber SCs demonstrate a novel method for constructing multifunctional, size-minimized and flexible 2D modules from 1D fiber device units.

4.1.2 Integration of twisted fiber SCs. 
There are usually two approaches to integrate twisted-fiber SCs. They can be either co-woven/knitted into existing fabrics/textiles or they can be woven/knitted by themselves. Kim et al. have woven a 5 cm-long biscrolled PEDOT/MWNT yarn SC into a glove (Fig. 7g) and the device capacitance showed a minor change (∼1%) after 10000 charge–discharge cycles.21 The co-woven structure with conventional yarns provides moisture and air breathability, i.e., moisture and air can pass through the fabric, and thus provides comfort for wearers. In another sample, Gao et al. have woven two individual 40 cm-long rGO–CNT/CMC core–sheath fibers into a cloth, forming a co-woven fabric (Fig. 7h).33 Alternatively, two individual 40 cm-long core–sheath fibers can be used as an anode and a cathode to form a cloth-like SC (Fig. 7i) on their own, which showed a capacitance of 28 mF at the charge–discharge current of 10 μA. The device performance was better than a 25 mF commercial SC.33 Such a cloth-like device represents a step towards the development of new energy textiles.


4.1.3 Integration of coaxial fiber SCs. 
For coaxial fiber SCs, a bundle of fibers can be bound together to form a larger diameter yarn electrode. Lee's group at Sungkyunkwan University in Korea fabricated a coaxial fiber SC, which consisted of a center core electrode made of carbon fiber bundles coated with MWCNTs and an outer electrode from electro-spinning carbon nanofiber paper (Fig. 7j).15 It had a capacitance of 86.8 mF cm−2 (6.3 mF cm−1), an energy density of 9.8 μW h cm−2 (0.7 μW h cm−1, 0.14 mW h cm−3), and a power density of 189.4 μW cm−2 (13.7 μW cm−1, 2.73 mW cm−3). The good performance was attributed to several factors related to the integration of a large number of fibers: (1) the use of MWCNT-coated carbon fiber bundles led to a higher surface area compared to a single fiber; (2) the coaxial structure had larger effective areas for ion storage as compared to the twisted structure; (3) the carbon fiber bundle was more conductive than a single fiber. Furthermore, four SCs, each having a length of 3.6 cm, were connected in series to light up a green light emitting diode (LED), as shown in Fig. 7k. The possibility of integrating many fibers in a large-diameter yarn is a key advantage of this method, compared to the method used for integrating fibers on a flat substrate.

4.2. Integration of multifunctionality into a single fiber
Fiber SCs are highly attractive because they can be used as efficient building blocks, and be easily integrated to construct multifunctional or self-powered hybrid energy systems. Wang et al. reported the first prototype of an integrated fiber device with both energy converters and storage units along a single fiber using ZnO nanowires and graphene as active electrode materials.41Fig. 8a shows that the fiber consisted of a nanogenerator, a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) and a SC, which can simultaneously scavenge both mechanical and solar energy, and store them in the SC. Although the energy storage efficiency of the SC is not described in detail, the idea of integrating devices of different functionalities on a single fiber represents a new direction in developing fiber-based electronics and self-power systems.

Following this work, Peng et al. reported an integrated fiber, which comprised of a DSSC and a SC, to convert solar energy into electricity and subsequently store the electricity as chemical energy.42Fig. 8b shows that the energy fiber was made from aligned TiO2 nanotube modified Ti wires and CNT fibers.42 The photoactive materials, such as dye molecules, were deposited onto one section of the modified Ti wire to form the photoelectric-conversion (PC) part, and a PVA/H3PO4 electrolyte was dip-coated onto the other section to produce the energy storage (ES) part. Aligned CNT fibers were then twisted with the modified Ti wire to produce the integrated fiber. The CNT fibers served as both the counter electrode of the DSSC and the SC electrode.42 The integrated fiber can convert solar energy to electricity in the PC part, and subsequently store solar energy in the ES part during sunlight exposure, as well as release the energy stored in the ES part when sunlight was deprived. The energy conversion efficiency (the ratio between the useful energy output (i.e. electricity) and the given energy input (i.e. solar energy) in an energy conversion system used to convert energy from one form to another) of the PC part reached 2.2%, while the ES part had an energy storage efficiency (the ratio between the stored electricity energy in a SC and the overall electricity energy converted from solar energy) of 68.4% with a capacitance of 0.6 mF cm−2. To improve the overall energy efficiency, Zou et al. designed another integrated fiber with a similar architecture using PANI-coated stainless steel wires instead of the Ti wire (Fig. 8c).43 The use of PANI with large pseudocapacitance significantly improved the capacitance of the ES part up to 41 mF cm−2. The PC part had an energy conversion efficiency of 4.56%, while the overall energy efficiency of the integrated fiber was up to 2.1%. The stored energy in the FSC charged by the DSSC can be used to light a red LED. This integrated fiber structure enables promising applications; for example, it is envisaged that it can be easily integrated into electronic textiles by a weaving technique and serve as a self-powering system for portable electronics.
Other than DSSCs, a polymeric solar cell is another attractive option for the PC part. Peng et al. integrated a polymeric solar cell with a SC on a TiO2 nanotube modified Ti wire. The polymeric solar cell was based on poly(3-hexyl thiophene):phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS).44 Aligned MWCNT sheets were wrapped around a coaxial fiber as illustrated in Fig. 8d.44 The coaxial design not only enabled fast charge separation and transport for the PC part but also rendered effective contact for the ES part. Although a high energy storage efficiency of 68.4% was obtained for the ES part, the energy conversion efficiency of the PC part was still limited (<1%). Thus, the overall energy efficiency for this integrated fiber was lower than that using a DSSC as the PC part.42,43
More recently, Peng et al. reported a new design by wrapping a PANI coated CNT fiber around a TiO2 nanotube modified Ti wire (Fig. 8e).45 The integrated fiber can simultaneously realize both the PC and ES parts. It has demonstrated a high photoelectric conversion efficiency of 6.58%, and a capacitance of 2.13 mF cm−2 (85.03 μF cm−1). Eight fibers were integrated in series to power up a red LED lamp (Fig. 8f). A unique merit of this design is that it can work as a solar cell to power electronic devices at day time and as a SC at night. Peng et al. also developed an elastic coaxial energy fiber that converted solar energy into electric energy in its sheath and stored the electric energy in its core using aligned CNT sheets as electrodes. Such coaxial structure electrodes enabled a total efficiency of energy conversion and storage up to 1.83%, and retained stable performances upon bending and stretching.46
5. Conclusions and outlook
Fiber SCs have attracted significant interest owing to their unique merits of being ultrathin, highly flexible, and capability of being integrated into wearable electronics and smart textiles. In this tutorial review, we have introduced the basics of their performance evaluation and summarized the latest developments in device configurations, fiber electrode materials, and device integrations. There are three basic device configurations, i.e., two parallel fibers, two twisted fibers, and one coaxial fiber. Various flexible fiber electrodes have been fabricated using metal wires or metal-coated plastic wires, carbonaceous fibers, such as CNT fibers, carbon fibers, graphene fibers or their hybrid fibers. Innovative approaches have also been used to modify these fibers to improve their conductivity and accessible surface area in order to achieve higher capacitance and better flexibility and stretchability. Furthermore, pseudocapacitive materials, such as nanostructured metal oxides and conducting polymers, have been incorporated into carbonaceous electrodes to increase their total capacitances. Some attempts have been made to integrate fiber SCs into multifunctional or self-powered hybrid systems. Despite the aforementioned impressive progress, it is still a great challenge to develop high-performance fiber SCs with sufficient energy capacity and power for practical applications. In our view, the roadblocks, also future research opportunities or potential problem solving methods, lie in several aspects as discussed below.
First, all currently-developed fiber SCs cannot compete with micro-batteries as micro-scale energy storage devices in terms of energy density. Although no macro-scale textile energy storage devices exist so far, the general expectation for fiber SCs as macro-scale textile energy storage devices is that their gravimetric and volumetric energy density should be close to some common batteries. Thus, major research efforts are needed to develop fiber electrodes, which have high capacitances without sacrificing their power density and cycling life, as well as maintaining their mechanical flexibility. A potential problem solving method is to innovatively design fiber materials at the nanoscale to enable a large ion assembled surface area to obtain high EDLC, as well as efficiently accommodate pseudocapacitive materials in order to achieve large pseudocapacitance. For example, our recent work on N-doped rGO–SWCNT hybrid fibers shows volumetric energy density comparable to thin-film Li batteries.14
Second, most of the fiber SCs developed so far used symmetrical device architecture with two identical electrodes. As such, their voltage window was limited to 0.6–1 V. For practical applications, high-voltage SCs are needed to reduce the number of individual SCs in series to meet the high voltage requirements. A potential solution is to develop asymmetric fiber SCs with one capacitor-type electrode as the power source and the other battery-type Faradic electrode as the energy source. By doing so, we can capitalize on the different electrochemical windows of the two types of electrodes to achieve high working voltage and thus leading to an improved energy density. The development of such asymmetric fiber SCs is still in the infancy stage.47
Third, almost all fiber SCs developed so far utilized PVA based gel electrolytes. The limitations for current gel polymer electrolytes are their low ionic conductivities and limited voltage window (<2.5 V). Thus, to solve these problems, it is important to conduct research on improving existing polymer gel electrolytes or developing new solid state electrolytes which offer higher ionic conductivities, and voltage windows. This is critical in realizing fiber SCs with high energy density. In addition, such electrolytes could also be safer alternatives for wearable electronics and smart textiles.
Fourth, there is a lack of standardized methods to evaluate device performances. As suggested by previous reviews,48 it is critical to include all relevant experimental details, i.e. active mass loading in fiber electrodes (mg cm−2 and mg cm−1), capacitance per length and area of fiber electrodes (mF cm−1 and mF cm−2), equivalent series resistance per length or area of fibers, comprehensive flexibility testing and all physical dimensions (diameter, thickness, length, volume) of each component used in fiber SCs. Without the complete data, it is difficult to compare the reported performances, as can be seen in Table 1 of this review. A possible solution is to set up standardized guidelines for reporting the performance of fiber SCs which requires the efforts from authors as well as journal reviewers and editors.
Fifth, safety is a critical issue for the application of fiber SCs in wearable electronics or smart textiles. The use of toxic liquid electrolytes in fiber SCs is problematic because liquid electrolytes may leak during the lifetime of products. The toxicity of many nanomaterials currently studied as fiber electrode materials is still unclear. A potential solution is to use appropriate encapsulation by safe materials to isolate nanomaterials from direct contact with the human body. Furthermore, the environmental safety of fiber SCs should also be carefully evaluated from their production process to recycling of used products.
Sixth, to realize large scale applications of the fiber SCs, low-cost scalable methods have to be developed for fiber electrode synthesis, SC assembling, and integration with other electronic components. It is a great challenge to design methods suitable for both micro-scale and macro-scale applications because of their different specific requirements. For example, as micro-scale energy storage devices, the fabrication methods of fiber SCs have to be compatible to the existing electronic fabrication process. On the contrary, for macro-scale textile energy storage, it is beneficial to utilize textile manufacturing techniques. Thus, we need to carefully tailor fabrication methods, which take into account such requirements, to bridge the gap.
