    , Accepted 27th October 2020First published on 28th October 2020AbstractCyclometalated Ru(II) complexes with 2-arylbenzimidazole antenna ligands bearing electron-donor/withdrawing substituents and anchoring 4,4′-dimethoxycarbonyl-2,2′-bipyridine have been prepared and their structure, optical and electrochemical properties have been studied. The complexes possess enhanced light-harvesting characteristics compared to those of the standard N719 dye and absorb light up to 750 nm. In addition, they demonstrate reversible redox behavior with Ru3+/Ru2+ potentials being finely tuned by the change of the electron-donating ability of cyclometalated ligands. After a mild hydrolysis of dimethoxycarbonyl groups the excellent optical properties of the complexes remain unchanged and they show good efficiency when tested in dye-sensitized solar cells.
Introduction
Polypyridine ruthenium(II) complexes have attracted great attention as effective luminophores,1–3 antitumor agents,4 fluorescent dyes in protein imaging5 and photosensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells6–9 due to their excellent photophysical properties. Numerous Ru(II) dyes containing anchoring 4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridine (H2dcbpy, which is essential for a strong binding of the dye on the TiO2 surface) and ancillary isothiocyanates as well as terpyridine-based Ru(II) complexes have been synthesized and successfully examined in DSSCs (Chart 1).10–15 Although these dyes demonstrated high power conversion efficiencies in Grätzel cells their poor long-term performance mainly caused by the low stability of Ru(II) complexes with monodentate NCS− ligands initiated studies of more stable ruthenium compounds.16 The replacement of isothiocyanates by a bidentate (or tridentate) cyclometalated (C^N) ligand not only leads to an increase in the stability of Ru(II) complexes, but also gave an opportunity to finely tune the optical and redox properties of the complexes.17–26
 Chart 1  Structures of classic Ru(II) dyes (N719, N749) and some cyclometalated NCS-free photosensitizers. R = various electron-donor groups. 
The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of a cyclometalated Ru(II) complex is delocalized over the metal centre and the metalated aryl fragment of a C^N ligand.24,27 So, the variation of the aryl substituents affects immediately the energy of the HOMO stabilizing it (increasing the Ru3+/Ru2+ redox potential) when the substituent is electron-withdrawing and destabilizing it (decreasing the Ru3+/Ru2+ redox potential) if the substituent has the opposite effect. In contrast, the LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) of the complex is mainly localized on the anchoring H2dcbpy and its energy is just slightly influenced by the changes in the C^N ligand.28
Thus, the HOMO–LUMO gap decreases upon an increase of the electron-donating ability of the C^N ligand and, hence, the corresponding low-energy absorption band of the complex undergoes a bathochromic shift that enhances the light-harvesting properties of the dye. Notwithstanding, the majority of reported cyclometalated Ru(II) dyes contain 2-phenylpyridine29 modified by fluoro-16 and even trifluoromethyl-30 and nitro-substituents17 at the aryl moiety to adjust the Ru3+/Ru2+ redox potential to appropriate values (>0.67 V vs. NHE) for facilitating the regeneration of the photo-oxidized dye by a triiodide/iodide mediator in the solar cell. It seems reasonable to study other types of cyclometalating ligands to get the suitable redox potentials of the Ru(II) complexes along with the opportunity to use electron-donor substituents in the ligands.
Among various classes of C^N ligands 2-arylbenzimidazoles are very promising candidates for the construction of Ru(II) dyes because they contain several conjugated heteroaromatic rings, which cause a deepening of the colour of the resulting complexes, and are easily available both with electron-donor and electron-withdrawing functionalities via published protocols.31,32 Moreover, 2-arylbenzimidazoles have been successfully utilized in the synthesis of Ir(III)33 and Ru(II)34 photosensitizers for DSSCs.
In this work, we have designed and synthesized a series of cyclometalated Ru(II) complexes with 2-arylbenzimidazoles bearing electron-withdrawing (Cl, NO2) and electron-donating substituents (OMe, NMe2) and anchoring 4,4′-dimethoxycarbonyl-2,2′-bipyridine. We thoroughly studied the effect of the ligand structure on the geometry, optical and electrochemical properties of the complexes as well as their electronic structures by a combined DFT-TDDFT approach. It was found that the complexes had appropriate oxidation potentials and demonstrated reversible redox behaviour, an optimal ground and excited state localization along with excellent light-harvesting characteristics. A mild hydrolysis of the dimethoxycarbonyl groups did not alter the properties of the dyes which were successfully tested in a DSSC.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and structure
Complexes 1–5 were synthesized via a standard two-step procedure17 involving the formation of the intermediate mono-cyclometalated Ru(II) species‡ followed by their use in the reaction with 4,4′-dimethoxycarbonyl-2,2′-bipyridine (Scheme 1). The target compounds were characterized by 1H, 1H,1H COSY, 13C NMR and HRMS (see ESI†), complexes 3 and 5 were studied by X-ray crystallography. In the case of pbi-NO2 a half-sandwich side-product [Ru(p-cymene)(C,N-pbi-NO2)(N,C-pbi-NO2)][PF6] was also isolated and studied by X-ray analysis.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of complexes 1–5. 
In [Ru(p-cymene)(C,N-pbi-NO2)(N,C-pbi-NO2)]+, the Ru(II) ion adopts a pseudotetrahedral “three-legged piano stool” geometry with two legs being occupied by the bidentate cyclometalated (C^N) ligand and the remaining by the same ligand coordinated in a monodentate mode by the N atom while the p-cymene ring acts as an η6 ligand forming the seat of the piano stool (Fig. 1). In the crystal, both crystallographically independent molecules of the complex are in the same space conformation which is stabilized by a strong intramolecular π–π interaction (3.214(6)–3.221(6) Å) between the 4-nitrophenyl ring of the monodentate pbi-NO2 and the benzimidazole unit of the cyclometalated ligand.
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures of half-sandwich [Ru(p-cymene)(C,N-pbi-NO2)(N,C-pbi-NO2)]+ (left), complexes 3 (middle) and 5 (right). pbi-NO2 = 1-phenyl-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-benzimidazole. Displacement ellipsoids are shown at the 50% probability level. 
The Ru-cym(centroid) distances are in the range from 1.719(5) to 1.731(5) Å (Table S2†) which is typical of Ru(II) complexes with p-cymene according to the Cambridge Structural Database. The complex molecules assemble through C–H⋯π interactions forming a loose crystal packing with channels passing along the a axis filled by disordered solvent chloroform molecules.
In both complexes 3 and 5, the ruthenium(II) ion adopts a slightly distorted octahedral geometry formed by four nitrogen atoms of bipyridine ligands and nitrogen and carbon atoms of cyclometalated benzimidazoles (Fig. 1). The Ru–C bond lengths are within the range from 2.061(3) to 2.075(6) Å. Because of the trans-effect, the Ru–N bonds lying opposite to the Ru–C ones are noticeably longer than the other Ru–N distances in the complexes (2.124(2)–2.127(4) vs. 2.015(3)–2.074(5) Å). All the coordinated ligands are almost planar – dihedral angles between the benzimidazole units and the metalated aryl rings and do not exceed 7°, whereas angles between the adjacent pyridine rings in bipyridines are in the range 4–10°. In both crystals, the complex molecules assemble through C–H⋯π interactions forming loose crystal packings containing disordered solvent molecules. In the crystal of 5, there are wide channels passing along the b axis filled with highly disordered solvent heptane molecules.
Cyclic voltammetry
Complexes 1–5 demonstrate reversible redox behaviour in acetonitrile at 25 °C. The Ru3+/Ru2+ potential varies from 0.16 to 0.41 V vs. ferrocene depending on the electron-donating/withdrawing ability of the C^N ligand (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Nitro- and chloro-substituents cause an increase of the redox potential compared to that of complex 3 (with unsubstituted 1,2-diphenylbenzimidazole) whereas N,N-dimethylamino- and two methoxy-groups have an opposite effect. It is interesting that the positive shifts of the potential induced by the both acceptor substituents are almost equivalent (50 and 60 mV) and noticeably smaller than the negative shifts caused by the electron-donor groups (−180 and −190 mV). These data indicate that the HOMO of complexes 1–3 are very likely to be composed mainly of Ru d-orbitals with some admixture of π-orbitals of the C^N ligand whereas the HOMO of 4 and 5, in contrast, contains a significantly larger contribution of π(C^N) orbitals.

At negative potentials, there are from two to four waves corresponding to the reduction of the ligands. Two highly resolved reversible waves at −1.54 and −1.85 V are practically not sensible to the changes in the C^N ligand and correspond to the reduction of 4,4′-dimethoxycarbonyl-2,2′-bipyridine.21 A weak irreversible wave at about −1.34 V and two reversible waves in the range from −1.97 to −2.29 V may be attributed to the reduction of the cyclometalated benzimidazoles while a wave at −1.71 V (complex 1) which significantly overlaps with the adjacent waves is likely to correspond to the reduction of the NO2-substituted metalated aryl moiety.
Optical properties
In the UV-Vis spectra of 1–5 measured in acetonitrile at 25 °C there are several intensive absorption bands caused either by π → π* electronic transitions localized on both types of ligands (250–350 nm) or metal-to-ligand charge transfers (350–750 nm). An increase in electron-donor properties of the C^N ligands results in a significant bathochromic shift (up to 40 nm) of the longest-wavelength absorption maximum of the complexes so that complex 5 containing NMe2 substituents has the extinction coefficient of 15000 M−1 cm−1 at 603 nm (Fig. 3 and Table 1).
 Fig. 3  MLCT part of UV-Vis spectra of complexes 1–5 and N719 measured in degassed acetonitrile at 25 °C. 
All the complexes are better light absorbers than N71935 (in the range from 350 to 500 nm and at >550 nm) that may result from both the stronger electron-donating ability and extended aromatic π-system of cyclometalated benzimidazoles compared to isothiocyanates. Moreover, the reduction of molecular symmetry of the complexes caused by introduction of a nonsymmetric C^N ligand increases the number of electronic transitions in the visible spectral range.17 An additional absorption band with ε of 8000–12000 M−1 cm−1 can be found at 508–535 nm in the spectra of the dyes.
Complexes 2–5 demonstrate very weak luminescence in the range 700–900 nm (Φ < 0.1%)§ which is typical of this type of Ru(II) dye.21,35 There are from three to four emission bands in the spectra and only the longest-wavelength maximum is noticeably red-sifted while increasing the electron-donating ability of the C^N ligand (Table 1 and Fig. S37†). For complex 1 the emission was not detected that may be caused by the NO2-induced nonradiative decay of the excited state of the dye.17
Additionally, the optical energy gap (Eg) for complexes 1–5 was calculated from their diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. S36†) and it correlates well with the electrochemical gap taken from CV studies. Using Eg values the excited state redox potential E(Ru3+/Ru2+*) for complex 1 was estimated whereas for the other complexes these potentials were calculated using the E0–0 values obtained from their emission spectra (Table 1).
DFT calculations
The electronic structure of complexes 1–5 was also studied by density functional theory (DFT). Occupied frontier molecular orbitals of the complexes are composed of d-orbitals of the metal and π-orbitals of C^N and N^N ligands (Fig. 4 and Table S3†). An increase in the electron-donating ability of the substituents in the C^N ligand results in a drop of the d(Ru) orbital contribution to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the complexes from 62% (complex 1) to 9% (complex 5) with a simultaneous increase of the π(C^N) orbital contribution from 20 to 70%, respectively. In addition, this is accompanied by a significant destabilization of the HOMO. It is interesting that varying the C^N ligand causes just a redistribution of the electron density between the Ru centre and the cyclometalated ligand keeping the contribution of π(N^N) orbitals practically unchanged (18–20%).
 Fig. 4  Energy of frontier molecular orbitals (HOMO−4–LUMO+2) of complexes 1–5. The localization of the orbitals is given for complexes 1 and 5 (for the other see Fig. S38†). Only orbitals that participate in the most intensive electronic transitions in the visible spectral range are presented. HOMO – highest occupied molecular orbital, LUMO – lowest unoccupied molecular orbital. 
Although low-lying occupied orbitals (HOMO−1 and HOMO−2) are mainly localized on the Ru centre (>50%) the change of the C^N ligand has different effects on their composition. The contributions of both d(Ru) and π(C^N) orbitals to the HOMO−2 (69–76% and 7–10%, respectively) are almost invariant in the series of complexes whereas the composition of the HOMO−1 is more sensible to the nature of the aryl substituent in the benzimidazoles – in going from 1 to 5 the metal tends to contribute lesser (from 77 to 54%) while the contribution of π-orbitals of both the C^N and N^N ligands increases (from 12 to 20% and from 10 to 26%, respectively).
The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the complexes along with LUMO+1 and LUMO+2 is almost exclusively localized on the anchoring 4,4′-dimethoxycarbonyl-2,2′-bipyridine and their energies are practically not influenced by the variation of the C^N ligand.
The increase of the HOMO energy and the change of its composition in the series of complexes explains the observed drop of the oxidation potential whereas the variation of the HOMO–LUMO gap correlates well with the decrease in the electrochemical gap obtained from cyclic voltammetry studies. Still, the DFT calculations predict overestimated red shifts of the absorption maxima upon the enhancement of the electron-donor properties of the C^N ligand compared to those observed in the UV-Vis spectra of the complexes (for the longest-wavelength absorption band – 120 and 40 nm, respectively). Hence, the most interesting visible band at 566–603 nm, although it displays a noticeable sensitivity to the cyclometalated ligand variations, can scarcely be attributed to the HOMO → LUMO electronic transition. To gain more insights into electronic transitions in complexes 1–5 time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations were carried out.
TDDFT electronic spectra are in good agreement with experimental UV-Vis spectra of the complexes (Fig. 5). The HOMO → LUMO transitions are highly sensitive to the substituents in the C^N ligand and the decrease in their energy upon the increase of the electron-donor properties of the C^N ligand is quite expected. Still, these transitions have very low oscillator strengths (<0.004, Table S4†) and the latter slightly decrease in going from 1 to 5 because of the noticeable drop of the d(Ru) contribution to the HOMO.
 Fig. 5  TDDFT electronic spectra of complexes 1–5. 
As a result, the HOMO → LUMO transitions are responsible just for the long-wavelength low-intensive shoulders in the absorption spectra of the complexes at 650–800 nm. In turn, the most intensive absorption bands in the range 400–600 nm originate from the electronic transitions from HOMO−1 and HOMO−2 (and partially from HOMO−3 for complexes 4 and 5) to LUMO and LUMO+1 and, hence, correspond mainly to the charge transfer from Ru d-orbitals to π*-orbitals of the anchoring ligands. Interligand (C^N → N^N) and intraligand (N^N → N^N) charge transfers have just little contributions to these bands and, hence, the influence of the cyclometalated ligand on absorption spectra of the complexes is very likely to result from the modulation of the energy of HOMO−1, HOMO−2 and HOMO−3 upon the decrease or increase of the electron-donor properties of the C^N ligand.
Thus, the joint experimental and theoretical study of complexes 1–5 shows that the variation of substituents in the aryl fragment of the cyclometalated benzimidazole ligand affects substantially the redox potentials of the dyes and, in contrast, allows to finely tune their low-energy absorption bands. Moreover, the ground state oxidation potentials of 1–5 are all higher than 0.8 V vs. NHE (the critical value to produce the driving force sufficient for the regeneration of a dye by the I3−/I− redox pair is 0.67 V (ref. 10)) whereas the excited state redox potentials of the complexes are all smaller than −0.5 V (the Fermi level of TiO2) to spontaneously inject electrons into the conduction band of the semiconductor and, thus, all the dyes are suitable for use in DSSCs.
Photovoltaics
Complexes 1–5 were converted to the corresponding acids and thoroughly studied. Hydrolysis of the ester groups in 1–5 by aqueous tetra-n-butylammonium hydroxide proceeds in 5 min at r.t. and is accompanied by a drastic colour change of the solution from dark-green to dark-violet (for complexes 1 and 2, from dark-violet to dark-pink) because of the hypsochromic shift of the long-wavelength bands by 25–35 nm (Fig. 6). An addition of 1 M hydrochloric acid to the solutions gives dark-green or dark-violet precipitates of the corresponding acids which have absorption spectra identical to those of the ester form of the complexes.
 Fig. 6  UV-Vis spectra of complex 5 in different forms: ester (· · ·), base (- - -) and acid (—) measured in degassed ethanol at 25 °C. 
TiO2-coated photoanodes sensitized by complexes 1–5 (in the acid form) demonstrate excellent optical properties absorbing light in almost the whole visible spectral range (Fig. 7).

Fig. 8 and S39–S53† show the current density–voltage curves as well as the transient photovoltage and photocurrent responses of the cells with the TiO2 photoanodes sensitized by complexes 1–5 and N719. Complex 1 demonstrates the poorest characteristics that may be caused by the NO2-induced nonradiative decay of the excited state of the dye preventing the electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2. The other dyes exhibit comparable open-circuit voltages (VOC) whereas their short-circuit current densities (JSC) are dependent on their photophysical properties so that the best photovoltaic characteristics belong to complexes 4 and 5 containing C^N ligands with the most pronounced electron-donating properties.

Intensity-modulated photocurrent and photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS and IMVS) yields time constants which are related to the electron transport and electron recombination. Both parameters can be used to calculate the diffusion coefficient of the charge carriers.
IMPS allows determination of the transit time τtr, i.e., the time necessary for electrons to reach the FTO surface from the outermost anode surface. The value of τtr can be calculated from the relationship τtr = 1/2πfIMPS,(1)where fIMPS is the frequency corresponding to the minimum of the photocurrent spectrum. The transit times determined from the hodographs presented in Fig. 9 are in the range from 2 to 4 ms in the series of complexes and the shortest time corresponds to the photoanode based on complex 4 (Table 2).

The lifetime of charge carriers τrec can be calculated from the following equation τrec = 1/2πfIMVS,(2)where fIMVS is the frequency corresponding to the minimum of the photopotential spectrum. Based on the obtained hodographs (Fig. 10), the lifetimes of charge carriers (electrons) are in the range 9.3–12.6 ms.
 Fig. 10  Intensity-modulated photovoltage spectra (IMVS) for TiO2 photoanodes sensitized by complexes 2–5. Illumination by monochromatic light (538 nm) at the power of 14 mW. 
The IMPS and IMVS measurements show that the lifetime of electrons is ∼3–4.5 times longer than the injection time (which is necessary for the transfer of electrons into the conduction band of the semiconductor) for complexes 2–5.
Both time constants can be used to estimate the charge collection efficiency hcc = 1 − τtr/τrec. It is a crucial factor for characterizing the overall performance of dye-sensitized solar cells. High values of charge collection efficiencies hcc = 0.68–0.78 show that the studied complexes provide an effective electron transport at the dye-semiconductor interface in the cell.

Fig. 11 shows the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) spectra of TiO2 photoanodes sensitized by complexes 2–5. The IPCE spectra match the solution absorption spectra of the dyes and become higher from 2 to 4 which is in line with light-harvesting properties of the complexes in solution and of the dye-loaded TiO2 electrodes (Fig. 7). Moreover, the higher IPCE values (as well as JSC) of 4 and 5 can be explained by the higher amount of dye absorbed on the TiO2 surface (Table 2) in comparison with the other complexes (1, 2 and 3).

Considering the excellent light-harvesting properties of complexes 2–5 and their appropriate redox characteristics along with good electron transport kinetics the resulting low power conversion efficiencies are quite unexpected. In our opinion, the main reason for the low photocurrent measured is the regeneration kinetics and probably the change of the mediator (for example, the use of a Co3+/Co2+ system) favourably affects the cell efficiency.
Conclusions
In summary, we have presented a joint experimental and theoretical study of a series of cyclometalated Ru(II) complexes designed and synthesized for application in dye-sensitized solar cells. The introduction of a cyclometalated benzimidazole-based ligand to the Ru centre enhanced the light-harvesting characteristics of the complexes compared to the standard N719 dye whereas variation of the substituents in the C^N ligand substantially affected the redox potentials of the dyes and to a lesser extent their long-wavelength absorption maxima. A DFT study of the complexes showed that the change of the C^N ligand mainly influenced the HOMO while altering just a little the energy and composition of low-lying orbitals (HOMO−1, HOMO−2) which, according to TDDFT calculations, were responsible for the most intensive MLCT absorption bands in the visible spectral range.
Complexes 2–5 were successfully tested in dye-sensitized solar cells and demonstrated excellent electron transport kinetics along with power conversion efficiencies in the range from 1.5 to 3% which are comparable with that of N719 (5%) measured under the same conditions.
Experimental
All commercially available reagents were at least reagent grade and used without further purification. Solvents were distilled and dried according to standard procedures. 1,2-Diphenylbenzimidazole (pbi), 1-phenyl-2-(4-chlorophenyl)benzimidazole (cpbi), 1-phenyl-2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)benzimidazole (mpbi), 1-phenyl-2-(4-nitrophenyl)benzimidazole (pbi-NO2) and 1-phenyl-2-(4-chlorophenyl)benzimidazole (npbi) were prepared as previously described.32,36,37

1H and 13C NMR spectra were acquired at 25 °C on Bruker Avance 400 and 600 instruments and chemical shifts were reported in ppm referenced to residual solvent signals. High resolution and accurate mass measurements were carried out using a Bruker microTOF-Q™ ESI-TOF (Electro Spray Ionization/Time of Flight) and Thermo Scientific™ LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometers. Electronic absorption and diffuse reflectance spectra were measured on a Cary 5000 Agilent spectrophotometer. Emission spectra were recorded using a FluoroMax Plus spectrophotometer over excitation with a xenon lamp. An Econix-Expert Ltd Ecotest-VA polarograph was used for electrochemical measurements with a glassy carbon working electrode, platinum counter electrode, and saturated Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Polarographic curves were recorded in Ar-saturated acetonitrile with 0.01 M (n-Bu4N)PF6 at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. Ferrocene was used as an external standard prior to measurements.
Synthesis
Complexes 1–5 were synthesized in two steps according to a general procedure.
(1) [Ru(p-cymene)Cl]2Cl2 (153.0 mg, 0.25 mmol), 2-arylbenzimidazole (0.5 mmol), NaOH (20.0 mg, 0.5 mmol), and KPF6 (184.0 mg, 1 mmol) were dissolved in 5 ml of anhydrous acetonitrile in a vial, carefully degassed with Ar, sealed, and kept at 47 °C for 72 hours. The solution turned from orange to dark yellow or greenish yellow, a white precipitate of inorganic chlorides formed. After cooling, the precipitate was filtered and washed with dichloromethane (2 × 5 ml). Organic phases were combined, evaporated and purified by column chromatography (silica gel, eluent CH2Cl2 → CH3CN:CH2Cl2 (1:9 vol.). The bright yellow fraction was isolated, reconstituted in 5 ml of dichloromethane, and precipitated using 20 ml of hexane to afford a yellow solid which was used in the next step without further purification (yield: 70–80%).
(2) RuL(CH3CN)4PF6 (0.113 mmol) and 4,4′-dicarboxylic-2,2′-bipyridine dimethyl ester (61.6 mg, 0.226 mmol) were refluxed in a mixture of methanol:dichloromethane (3:1 vol.) for 5 h under argon. The mixture almost immediately changed color from yellow to intense black-violet or black-green. The resulting mixture was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, eluent CH2Cl2:CH3OH (100:1 → 100:3 vol.). The dark band was collected and recrystallized from a dichloromethane–hexane mixture.

Carboxymethyl groups of dmdcbpy in complexes 1–5 were hydrolysed by stirring in anhydrous acetonitrile with 40% tetra-n-butylammonium hydroxide aqueous solution (2.5 eq.) for 15 min (progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC) followed by evaporation of the solvent. The crude solid was dissolved in water and the addition of several drops of 2 M HCl turned the colour of the solution from dark-violet to dark-green with simultaneous precipitation of a dark solid and adjusting pH to 2–3. The precipitate was decanted, washed several times with water using centrifugation until colourless and finally extracted with C2H5OH and the resulting dark-green solution was evaporated to dryness.

X-ray crystallography
Single crystals of 3 and 5 were obtained by slow evaporation of solvents from solutions of the complexes in CH2Cl2/n-heptane (1/1 vol.). Single crystals of [Ru(p-cymene)(C,N-pbi-NO2)(N,C-pbi-NO2)][PF6] were obtained upon evaporation of the reaction mixture during the synthesis of complex 1. Crystallographic data were collected at 150 K on a Bruker SMART APEX II diffractometer using graphite monochromatized Mo–Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) using a ω-scan mode. Absorption correction based on measurements of equivalent reflections was applied.38 The structures were solved by direct methods and refined by full matrix least-squares on F2 with anisotropic thermal parameters for all non-hydrogen atoms. In both structures, hydrogen atoms were placed at calculated positions and refined using a riding model. In structure 3, there are two crystallographically independent complex molecules one of which is situated on the two-fold rotation axis. So, the central Ru atom in this molecule is split over two adjacent positions to avoid its automatic location on the axis during the refinement that causes inadequate anisotropic displacement parameters of the ion. In structure 5, solvent dichloromethane (except one) and heptane molecules were not located and their contribution was suppressed by the SQUEEZE procedure.39 Crystallographic details are presented in Table S1,† selected bond lengths and angles – in Table S2.† CCDC 1987942, 1987941 and 1990906† contain the supplementary crystallographic data for the structures of complexes 3, 5 and [Ru(p-cymene)(C,N-pbi-NO2)(N,C-pbi-NO2)][PF6], respectively.
Photovoltaic measurements
Photoanodes were assembled as follows. TCO22-15 fluorinated tin oxide coated 2.9 × 2.9 cm glasses (Solaronix®, specific surface resistivity ∼15 Ω sq−1) were purified by aging in a sulfochromic mixture followed by ultrasonication in organic solvents (isopropanol and ace-tone) and distilled water, and then dried at 50 °C in air. Application of Ti-Nanoxide paste (D/SP, Solaronix®), comprising titania powder and α-terpineol as the binding agent, was performed by the standard “doctor blade” technique using a stencil with a 2.0 × 2.0 cm (∼90 μm depth) square hole. After application of the paste raw photoanodes were dried at 50 °C in air, and then calcined in a muffle furnace at 450 °C for 1 hour (heating rate 3 °C min−1, in air). The thickness of the obtained titanium dioxide film was about 15 μm, and it was determined using an Alpha-Step D-100 profilometer (KLA-Tencor). Sensitization of titanium dioxide was performed by soaking of photoanodes in ∼5 × 10−4 M methanol solutions of dyes for 24 hours followed by washing the electrodes with i-PrOH and drying in air at 50 °C for an hour. A three-electrode photoelectrochemical cell PECC-2 (Zahner) was used for the photoanode potential measurements. The photoanode served as the working electrode and a platinum wire with the surface area of 5 cm2 was used as the auxiliary electrode, a silver wire was used as the reference electrode. All potentials in figures are given relative to this reference electrode. Voltammetry measurements were conducted on a IPC Pro MF potentiostat. The working electrode was illuminated with a Newport AM 1.5 solar spectrum simulator with a power of 100 mW cm−2. The illuminated surface of the photoanode was 0.25 cm2. Illumination was conducted from a TiO2 photoanode side with adsorbed sensitizers. A mixture of 0.5 M LiI + 0.05 M I2 in acetonitrile was used as a mediator.
The current voltage characteristic was registered upon illumination by a two electrode scheme (sensitized electrode as a working electrode and platinum wire as an auxiliary electrode and a reference electrode) at the rate of 10 mV s−1 from initial voltage to zero (short circuit).
We used intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) to study the recombination characteristics of the dye-sensitized photoanode.40,41 IMPS and IMPS measurements were conducted on a ZAHNER's CIMPS-QE/IPCE workstation.
The working electrode was illuminated with a tunable light-source, TLS03. IMVS was performed without superposition of external polarization, i.e., under open circuit (OC) conditions. IMPS were recorded in a similar manner as photopotential spectra except for the cell was under short-circuit (SC) rather than OC conditions.
To examine the amount of chemisorbed dye on the TiO2 surface we carried out the desorption experiment according to ref. 22. The only difference was the longer soaking of the electrodes in the washing alkaline solution until they were whitened (10–12 h).
Computational details
All the gas-phase calculations reported in this paper have been performed within density functional theory (DFT),42 using the hybrid functional B3LYP.43,44 The standard def2-SVP basis set for light elements and Stuttgart-Dresden effective core potential (ECP) for the Ru atom,45 as implemented in the ORCA3.0 suite of programs,46 have been used together with the RIJCOSX approximation.47 Frequency analysis was carried out to check if optimized structures were local minima. No imaginary frequencies were found for local minima. Time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations were carried out at the ground state geometries to obtain vertical excitation energies and theoretical absorption spectra. The lowest 30 singlet–singlet excitation was computed.
