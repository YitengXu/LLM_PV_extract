    , Accepted 28th February 2018First published on 12th March 2018AbstractWith exceptional attributes like high carrier mobility, long diffusion lengths and tunable spectral absorption window, all-inorganic perovskites have shown the potential to be the most extraordinary and market competitive optoelectronic material, making their facile realization and detailed photophysical analysis necessary. Going beyond well reported perovskite quantum dots, all-inorganic cesium lead halide (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br or I) perovskite rods have been realized, both in pure as well as mixed halide phases, via a facile, environmentally benign, room temperature and solution based protocol. Using a series of halide precursor alterations in this general synthesis protocol, we have tailored the chemical and optical features of the rod in a subtle manner. The highlights of this synthesis protocol are the zero thermal budget and the ability to bulk produce and have tailor made control over exact phase formation. Pure phase halide perovskite rods were crystallized in the orthorhombic phase. These rods exhibit a strong intense cathodoluminescence emission which can be tuned over the entire visible range by varying the halide composition. Besides cathodoluminescence, these single crystalline perovskite rods also exhibited wavelength tunable photoluminescence. In addition to the pure phase synthesis of all of the inorganic perovskite forms, the halide induced structural features were also correlated with their optical properties in detail. Halide substituted band gap engineering results were further corroborated computationally via density functional analysis of these perovskites. Our preparation method provides a facile and adaptable pathway to rationally control the different forms of CsPbX3 perovskite, which may lead to opportunities for applications, such as in lasing, light-emitting diodes, solar cells, photo detectors etc.
Introduction
Industrial globalization and the growing population have caused a strong increase in the global demand for energy in recent years. Providing an adequate supply of energy resources for our economy is one of the major problems of the modern age. At present, the majority of the energy resources are fossil fuels. With the increasing usage of fossil fuels, global warming has escalated to a threshold, leaving a very serious impact on the environment. These fossil fuels will not be sustainable in the upcoming century due to their heavy usage and high consumption rate. To achieve sustainability for our society, the development of alternative renewable energy resources is of great significance. A few resources are currently available, such as wind force, hydraulic power and nuclear power, but solar energy is predominantly attractive because it is essentially clean and bottomless. Thus, the widespread applications of solar energy may cause a surge in global energy security by improving sustainability, reducing pollution, lowering the expense of alleviating climate change and reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. Photovoltaics and photocatalysis are the two outstanding techniques to exploit solar energy.
Since 1954, scientists have regularly used silicon to fabricate solar cell devices.1 However, bottleneck-like high fabrication and installation costs along with lower efficiency have forced researchers to look for other alternatives. Recently, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites with enticing optoelectronic and excitonic features have attracted tremendous attention as one of the most promising materials in this respect, where easy processability, low-cost fabrication and high efficiencies are the added advantages over traditional Si based technology.2–4
The group of all-inorganic perovskite materials has the chemical formula ABX3, where A and B stand for two cations with dissimilar sizes (typically A = Rb+ or Cs+ and B = Sn+ or Pb+) and X stands for an anion (typically X = Cl−, Br−, I− or a combination). Relying on several beneficial features, such as a high thermal stability, carrier mobility, absorption coefficient and other optoelectronic assets, they have found potential in diverse systems like LEDs, photovoltaics, photodetectors etc.5–8 Møller observed the first halide based perovskite crystal structure in cesium lead halide (CsPbX3: X = Cl, Br or I).9 Although the concept of all-inorganic perovskites is considered to date back to 1958, rigorous efforts have only been focused on the synthesis of morphologically tailored nanoforms and the optoelectronic features of these direct band gap perovskites after the recent breakthrough by Kovalenko et al. in 2015.10 In the last two years, intense research efforts have been directed towards the facile synthesis and structural and optoelectronic feature analysis of the direct band gap perovskite nanomaterials.11–14 Irrespective of this, detailed work on the synthesis of morphologically tuned nanostructures and an in-depth analysis of the structural features and the thermal and chemical phase stabilities of CsPbX3 nanostructures has been limited until now.
CsPbX3 nanostructures exhibit several intriguing optical and optoelectronic features.15–21 Due to these features, CsPbX3 nanostructures should demonstrate much broader wavelength (400–700 nm) tunable photoluminescence than the conventional metal-chalcogenides. CsPbBr3 crystallizes in the orthorhombic phase at room temperature, and undergoes a transition at 88 °C to the tetragonal phase and to the cubic phase at 130 °C.22 Despite its well-known phase transition temperature, the preparation of a stable single phase between the cubic and orthorhombic phases is very difficult.23 Furthermore, in some cases it also shows rapid adaptability towards a non-perovskite phase under ambient conditions.9,24 Such typical temperature dependent phase transformation behavior made studying the thermal stability of CsPbX3 phases under an ambient atmosphere more interesting from a research point of view. Besides, the phase, size and morphological tailoring of the nanostructures with atomic precision also played a vital role in determining the optoelectronic quality and thereby their usage in different potential areas.25–27 For instance, using the same perovskite material with different geometries, namely quantum dots and nanorods, resulted in different PL emissions, where the former showed isotropic emission and the latter displayed polarized. To date, metal oxides and metal chalcogenides in different dimensions and sizes have shown their dominance over other classes of material from an application point of view and plenty of work on these materials is documented in the literature. In this context, the shape-adaptable development of all-inorganic AMX3 perovskite nanomaterials is somewhat less documented.20 It is, therefore, indispensable to be able to control the shape, size and composition of CsPbX3 nanomaterials in order to establish a bridge between their geometry and their performance in optical and optoelectronic applications.
Although there are a few reports on shape controlled CsPbX3 nanoforms in the literature, the usage of costly equipment, prolonged growth times and the high synthesis temperatures and low product yields associated with these protocols cast a shadow over their universal applicability. For example, Pan et al.28 have synthesized CsPbX3 nanocubes via a microwave-assisted synthesis route at a relatively high temperature (160 °C). Using an ultrasonication assisted single-step ligand-mediated synthesis protocol, Tong et al. have prepared single-crystalline colloidal CsPbBr3 nanowires of uniform wideness in 60 minutes. Furthermore, they have also realized other pure phase perovskites using a CsPbBr3 nanowire template via a halide ion exchange process. However, trace amounts of Br remained present even after the completion of the halide ion exchange process.29 Recently, Seth et al. have prepared CsPbBr3 nanorods at room temperature and under an open atmosphere, where 1D rods were formed after 1 h at the expense of initially grown nanocubes.30 In attempts to circumvent the issues mentioned above and to prepare pure phase and mixed halide perovskites, research should be focused towards simplistic, zero thermal budgetary, rapid and scalable synthetic approaches for the production of CsPbX3 nanoforms.
Dissimilarities in optical band gaps and photo-carrier recombination rates caused by a degree of local lattice distortions in nanomaterials are intensively studied by researchers employing different luminescence techniques. Among these, cathodoluminescence (CL) and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy are considered to be highly effective techniques for resolving native centers and energy migration procedures, etc. CL occurs due to the impact of electron beams on luminescent materials whereas PL results from the movement of electrons to higher energy levels via photon absorption. In-depth analysis and understanding of the generation mechanism of luminescence using these two tools is one of the most effective ways to optimize optoelectronic features.
Herein, we present an in-depth CL spectroscopic study to explore the emission characteristics of high quality single crystalline all-inorganic CsPbX3 perovskite rods. Going beyond well documented 0D quantum dots, multifaceted CsPbX3 rods are realized via a facile chemical approach at room temperature within 10 min. The zero thermal budget, ability to bulk produce and tailor made control over the exact phase formation are the highlights of this synthesis protocol. Using subtle variation of the halide elements in stoichiometric proportions we have realized different pure phase all-inorganic perovskites as well as other mixed perovskites. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documentation of the formation of the CsPbX3 one dimensional architecture in pure and mixed phase halides. The synthesized samples show wide spectral tunability with a narrow full width half maximum (FWHM) which changes with variations in the element stoichiometry and the nature of the halide ions within the sample. The bowing effect of the samples is investigated in terms of the variation of their energy band gaps as a function of the halide composition and concentration, which suggested the high crystal quality of the synthesized products. The samples exhibited intense CL emission which varied significantly with the variation of accelerating voltages. Additionally, the halide concentration induced PL emission was examined, which showed emission wavelength tunability over the entire visible range. As they are not restricted to just optical analysis, we believe that these morphologically tuned pure phase rods are also appealing for their other possible uses in photo-detection, gas sensors, solar cells and so forth.
Experimental
Chemicals
Lead(II) chloride (PbCl2, 99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), lead(II) bromide (PbBr2, 99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), lead(II) iodide (PbI2, 99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), cesium chloride (CsCl, Sigma-Aldrich), cesium bromide (CsBr, Sigma-Aldrich), cesium iodide (CsI, Sigma-Aldrich), dimethylformamide (DMF, Alfa-Aesar), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Alfa-Aesar), hexane (Alfa-Aesar), oleic acid (OA, Alfa-Aesar), n-octylamine (Sigma-Aldrich) and tert-butanol (Sigma-Aldrich) were used. The water used throughout the experiment is double distilled and deionized.

Synthesis of the CsPbX3 rods. 
All solvents and reagents are of analytical grade and directly used without further purification. In a typical synthesis, CsBr (1.0 mmol) and PbBr2 (1.0 mmol) were dissolved in deionized water (DI) and DMF, separately. Furthermore, an oil phase was prepared by adding hexane to oleic acid (1.0 ml) and n-octylamine (0.5 ml). The CsBr solution was added drop by drop into the PbBr2 solution and then the final solution was mixed into the oil phase under vigorous stirring for 10 min. Afterwards, tert-butanol was added to the previous solution immediately to initiate the demulsification. A bright orange precipitate was separated using centrifugation and washed with hexane. Finally the precipitates were dried overnight in a vacuum and then collected. For the rest of the samples, such as CsPbCl3 and CsPbI3, DMSO and DMF were used to dissolve PbCl2 and PbI2, respectively, while the rest of the reaction protocol remained the same. The typical synthesis process is illustrated schematically in the ESI,† Fig. S1.


Synthesis of the mixed halides CsPb(Br1−xClx)3 and CsPb(Br1−xIx)3. 
Furthermore, for the preparation of the mixed halides like CsPbBr1.5I1.5, an aqueous solution was firstly prepared by mixing CsBr (0.5 mmol) with CsI (0.5 mmol). PbBr2 (0.5 mmol) and PbI2 (0.5 mmol) were dissolved in DMF separately. A separate oil phase was prepared by adding hexane to oleic acid and n-octylamine. Afterwards, the PbI2 solution and the CsBr and CsI solution mix were added drop by drop into the PbBr2 solution in sequence. The entire solution was then mixed into the oil phase under vigorous stirring for 10 min. Furthermore, to initialize the demulsification, tert-butanol was added immediately to the previous solution. Finally, the product was separated using centrifugation and washed with hexane. The precipitate was dried overnight in a vacuum and then collected. For the preparation of the other mixed halide samples, the respective reagents and precursors were mixed with exact stoichiometric ratios and the rest of the parameters were kept identical.

Results and discussion
Structural analysis

Fig. 1a shows the XRD pattern of the synthesized CsPbX3 samples with varying halide compositions. The sharp Bragg reflections observed for the products are in accordance with the perovskite phase. The peaks at 2θ = 15.45°, 21.84°, 31.01°, 34.64° and 38.05° correspond to the diffraction from the (100), (110), (200), (210) and (211) planes of the orthorhombic CsPbBr3 (JCPDF # 01-072-7929).14 The intense diffraction peaks obtained for the pristine as well as all of the mixed halide CsPbX3 samples are indicative of good crystalline quality. The XRD pattern of the pristine CsPbBr3, CsPbCl3, CsPbI3 and mixed halide CsPb(Br1−xClx)3 samples exhibit all of the major peaks for the orthorhombic perovskite phase with the space group Pnma. No other phases are detected within the XRD resolution. Noticeably, the two major peaks of the CsPbBr3 sample at 15.45° and 31.01° represent a prominent doublet feature, as presented in Fig. 1b and c, which further validates the orthorhombic phase formation. The pattern of the CsPb(Br1−xIx)3 samples exhibits similar Bragg reflections with some additional peaks. With the incorporation of I− ions in the perovskite lattice of the CsPbX3 sample, a phase transition may arise during the drying of the sample or the XRD experiment.31,32 Furthermore, a shift in the diffraction peaks towards a higher angle (2θ) with increasing Cl− concentration in the CsPb(Br1−xClx)3 samples, and towards a lower angle (2θ) with increasing I− concentration in the CsPb(Br1−xIx)3 samples, is observed (Fig. 1a). Such a type of XRD peak shifting can be ascribed to the lattice contraction caused by the shrinking of the halide ion radius from I− to Cl−.33 The average crystallite size of the CsPbX3 rods is calculated using the well-known Scherrer's formula (1)where k is the shape factor with a typical value of 0.94, λ is the wavelength of the X-ray (∼1.5406 Å), β is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peak and θ is half of the diffraction angle. Fig. 1d displays the Williamson–Hall plot of the CsPbCl3, CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 perovskite samples. From the Williamson–Hall plot we estimated the lattice strain. The calculated values of the crystallite size and crystal strain are listed in Table S1 (see ESI†). From the table, low strain values for the pure perovskite samples are very obvious compared to the strain values for the mixed halide samples, which is also an indicator of the better crystalline quality of the single halide containing samples.

Compositional studies
EDX elemental mapping and the corresponding spectrum of the perovskite samples with a single halide in Fig. 2 reveal the presence of only Cs, Pb and the corresponding halide. EDX spectra related to the other mixed phase samples are shown separately in the ESI† (Fig. S2). The absence of any impurity related peaks in these spectra corroborate the XRD results of pure phase formation. The compositions and stoichiometric ratios of the constituent elements of all of the samples are presented in Table S2 (ESI†). It is observed that the atomic ratios of the elements are well in accordance with their actual stoichiometry. The distribution of the constituent elements mimics the FESEM images exactly and thereby confirms the homogenous distribution of the elements.

Optical studies
UV-vis spectroscopic measurement is carried out for the as prepared perovskite powder samples to estimate their band-gap energies. Fig. 3a shows their diffuse reflectance spectra, i.e., R (%) as a function of the photon wavelength λ (nm). The sharp diminution in R (%) indicates that the all-inorganic perovskite CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) rods are highly crystalline. The optical band gap (Eg) is readily tuned from 1.76 to 2.98 eV covering the whole visible region by varying the composition of the halides in the CsPbX3 rods, which agrees well with previous reported values.34–36 The band gap of the CsPbCl3 sample is the maximum (2.98 eV) and for CsPbI3, it is the minimum (1.77 eV). With increased concentrations of Br− in the mixed halide CsPb(Br1−xClx)3 samples, the band gap is found to decrease. The diversity of the band gaps in these mixed halide samples can be associated with the different compositions and ionic radius of the halide ions. A progressive increase in halide ion radii from Cl− to I− ensures/results in an increment in bond length in the corresponding halides. A smaller bond length leads to tight binding of an electron inside the atom and hence more energy is required to remove them, leading to an increase in the band gap. Fig. 3b shows the Kubelka–Munk plot for the above samples as a function of photon energy (eV). The photon energy is readily calculated by the simple conversion relation (2)The Kubelka–Munk function is defined in terms of the following equation: (3)where F(R∞) = (1 − R)2/2R, A = proportionality constant, h = photon energy measured in eV, Eg = energy band gap and n is an index which characterizes the nature of the energy band transitions depending on whether it is direct or indirect, allowed or forbidden, etc. As CsPbX3 is a direct band gap type semiconductor, we have used n = 1/2. Extrapolating the linear portion of the [F(R∞)hν]2vs. hν plot, the values of Eg are determined. Fig. 3c and d shows the band gap bowing effect, i.e., the plotting of the band gap (Eg) vs. the halide (X = Cl or Br) concentration (x = 0 to 1). The variation of Eg with halide concentrations can be expressed as follows:37,38 EgCsPb(Br1−xClx)3 = xEg(CsPbCl3) + (1 − x)Eg(CsPbBr3) − x(1 − x)b(4)where x is the composition of chloride and b is the bowing parameter. For the composition of CsPb(Br1−xIx)3, in the above equation Cl− is substituted by I− but the rest of the equation remains unchanged. The value of b is calculated using the least-squares fitting of the Egvs. x data shown in Fig. 3c and d by a second order polynomial that gives the following quadratic equations: Y = 2.34 + 0.90x − 0.26x2(5) Y = 1.68 + 0.39x + 0.29x2(6)Eqn (4) represents the band gap (Eg) bowing effect with the increasing Cl/Br ratio in the CsPb(Br1−xClx)3 samples. Eqn (5) and (6) represent the Br to Cl and Br to I halide exchanged band gap bowing, respectively. The assessed values of the bowing parameter (b) from these equations are −0.26 and 0.29 eV, respectively. These values are very much lower than those for the inorganic semiconductors.39–42 The bowing parameter (b) signifies the degree of disorder in an alloy with varying composition. The low value of the bowing parameter for our samples indicates that the composition induced crystal disorder is insignificant and the crystal potential fluctuation is minor.43 The positive and/or negative value of the bowing parameter describes a deviation from the linear dependence of Eg with varying composition.

DFT analysis
Density functional calculations using hybrid functional approximation were further carried out to calculate the band gap of the synthesized samples theoretically. Fig. 4 displays the calculated band structure along the high symmetry direction of perovskites in the orthorhombic phase for the first Brillouin zone. The choice to use the orthorhombic phase of these CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br or I) perovskites is due to their general existence at room temperature.44 The band structures of these perovskites reveal separation of the valance band (VB) maxima and the conduction band (CB) minima by G–G symmetry. Such positioning further indicates the fundamental direct band gap nature of these three cesium halide perovskites around the G point. The estimated value from this symmetry point for CsPbBr3 is found to be 2.48 eV. Substitution of the Br ion with Cl or I resulted in changes in band gap energy. The energy band gap values for CsPbCl3 and CsPbI3 from similar symmetry points are 3.1 eV and 2.2 eV, respectively. These obtained band gap values agree well with those determined from UV-vis reflectance analysis. Furthermore, these calculated values are very close to other reported values obtained using the non-regular Tran and Blaha's modified Becke–Johnson (nTB-mBJ) and Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid functional methods.44,45 It is worth mentioning here that our adopted technique of HSE, without considering the spin orbit, gives more similar results to experimental values than other computational approximations. However, the consideration of spin orbit coupling in calculations could result in an underestimation of the bandgap.45 From the figure it is also obvious that by changing the halide from Cl to I, gradually the CB and VB, along with the lower valence bands, shifted towards the Fermi level. This result is accredited to the enhancement of electron number in the respective bands and habitation of the states near the Fermi level.46 Representative unit cells of these perovskites in stick ball arrangements are shown in Fig. 4d–f. The structures have an orthorhombic space group of Pnma. Lattice constants of the orthorhombic CsPbX3 unit cell were further calculated from the volume optimization of each unit, and the results are presented in Table S3 (please see the ESI†). From the table, increments in lattice constants from Cl to I are prominent. Such increments are simply due to the larger atomic radius of the I atom compared to that of the Cl atom. All of the aforementioned results are commensurate with the XRD and UV reflectance data and substantiate the ability to control bandgap engineering using halide substitution.

Morphological studies
FESEM images of the synthesized all-inorganic perovskite CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I or Br/I) samples are depicted in Fig. 5. Large scale morphological uniformity of the synthesized products is obvious from these low magnification images. The synthesized samples, three with different individual halides and one with mixed halides, showed a 1D rod like structure. Fig. 5a displays the FESEM image of the CsPbCl3 rod in which differences in diameters among the rods are very prominent. Substitution of the Cl ion with Br does not create much change in their shape (Fig. 5b). In both samples, the diameter of the rods varies in the nano-regime, however careful observation suggests that the CsPbBr3 rods possess relatively lower diameters compare to the CsPbCl3 sample. The typical length of the rods in both cases is in the order of micrometers. From the figure, the very smooth surface and faceted nature of the CsPbBr3 rod is prominent which suggests the high crystallinity of the sample. In the place of the two previous halides, substitution with iodine also leads to a 1D rod structure similar to that shown in the previous samples (Fig. 5c). Randomness in individual length is also observed here, however the diameter of the rods remained almost similar. These long rods were found to appear in bundles. Such a bundle formation phenomenon during drying for ultra-long rods is very common in the literature. These rods are very much smaller in dimension compared to those in previous reported works.33,47 Finally, for mixed halide samples, a rod shaped morphology is also obtained. As the reference sample, the FESEM image of CsPbBr1.5I1.5 is presented in Fig. 5d. The as-synthesized CsPbBr1.5I1.5 rods have an average diameter of ∼700 nm with an average length beyond 10 μm.
 Fig. 5  FESEM images of as-synthesized (a) CsPbCl3 (b) CsPbBr3, (c) CsPbI3 and (d) CsPb(Br/I)3 perovskite samples. 
The time dependent structural evaluation of a representative sample from the pure phase CSPbX3 perovskite, namely CsPbI3, is presented in the ESI† (Fig. S3) along with the corresponding XRD patterns. Besides the reaction time, temperature dependent syntheses of the same perovskite were also performed and the results are shown in ESI† (Fig. S4). Such results suggest the superior quality of the synthesized samples under optimum synthesis conditions, i.e. with a reaction time of 10 min at room temperature.
To investigate the structure and crystallinity of the synthesized products in detail, further TEM studies were performed. The TEM image corresponding to the CsPbCl3 sample in Fig. 6a exhibits a rod with a diameter of ∼200 nm and a length of ∼10 μm. A HRTEM image (Fig. 6b) of the individual rod reveals parallel lattice fringes with an assessed lattice spacing of 0.398 nm, corresponding to the (110) plane of the orthorhombic phase of CsPbCl3, which confirms the single crystalline nature. Furthermore, a selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the rod (Fig. 6c) with bright circular spots also confirms the single-crystalline nature. Although the rods corresponding to CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 have some size differences (Fig. 6d and g), they were found to display an analogous single crystalline nature. The HRTEM images in Fig. 6e and h relating to CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3, respectively, reveal well resolved lattice fringes running parallel to each other. The assessed interplanar spacing of 0.408 nm from Fig. 6e is consistent with the distance between the (110) crystal planes of orthorhombic phase CsPbBr3. A similar assessment for CsPbI3 reveals an interplanar spacing of 0.89 nm, which matches the (110) lattice plane (Fig. 6h).48 The SAED pattern (Fig. 6f) for CsPbBr3 shows bright circular spots and confirms the single crystallinity. The TEM image of the CsPbBr1.5I1.5 sample shown in Fig. 6i corroborates well with the corresponding FESEM image. Finally, a HRTEM image of the mixed halide sample is presented in the ESI†, which confirms its single crystalline nature (please see the ESI,† Fig. S5).

Cathodoluminescence study
With the ability to simultaneously detect secondary electron and light emission, as well as having a much higher spatial resolution than other conventional techniques, cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopy is considered to be the most effective tool for the determination of spatial distribution and the correlation between the physical features of perovskite materials and local transport and optical behavior.49,50 Room temperature CL spectra of the CsPbBr3 sample recorded at different accelerating voltages are presented in Fig. 7a. The magnification during the CL study was fixed at 350X with a spot area of ∼350 μm2 under the exposure of a high energy electron beam, and the acquisition time for each spectrum was 3 minutes. One single characteristic peak at ∼2.33 eV is very prominent in the CL spectra taken at different voltages. This strong intense peak is accredited to the band edge transition of CsPbBr3. Such positioning of the peak matches well with the band gap value obtained using UV-vis spectroscopy. Careful observation of these spectra and the magnified view shown in the inset of Fig. 7a discloses a few distinct differences between them. The progressive enhancement of the peak intensity and the relative sharpness is a result of the application of higher accelerating voltages. Accelerating voltage varied emission spectra for the mixed halide perovskites also showed similar intensity variation (see the ESI,† Fig. S6). Detailed analysis of the full width half maxima (FWHM) of the peaks in Fig. 7a suggests that the FWHM of ∼98 meV at 5 kV downshifted to ∼90 meV at 10 kV, which reduces further to 78 meV at 15 kV. With increased accelerating voltage, CL emission is generated from a deeper interior region of the CsPbBr3 rods and the characteristic peak progressively red shifts towards the slightly higher photon energy side. This trend shown by the spectra corroborates well with the CL study by Diab et al.51 With a high energy electron beam, the escape depth of CL photons increases and they are partially reabsorbed by the crystal. This type of strong reabsorption of the CL photons induces red shift in the bulk material.51 Additionally, this shift may also stem from changes in the physical features of the material. A change in the position of the near band edge peak in the spectrum can also originate from several types of defect incorporation, strain and fluctuation in the composition.51 The absence of any high energy extra peak in the CL spectra of the CsPbBr3 samples, even after 3 min electron beam irradiation, suggested the high stability of the perovskite samples. Substitution of the Br molecule by the other two halides, namely Cl and I, produces a drastic shift in the peak position. The emission spectra for the CsPbCl3 and CsPbI3 samples at 15 kV are plotted in Fig. 7b, along with that for a pristine CsPbBr3 sample. The intense emission peak in Fig. 7b for all samples suggests that the surface dangling bond of the rods does not impart any severe mid-gap trap states despite their low temperature processing, which is commonly considered to be the reason behind defect state and trap state incorporation.10 Generally, the halogen ions are found to reside on the surface of the CsPbX3 samples. The rich presence of halogen on the surface of the rods results in the self-passivation of the defects and a decrease in the non radiative trappers, which is also another reason behind such a strong emission of the samples.35,52 The CsPbI3 sample exhibited a narrow emission peak at ∼1.72 eV, which is attributed to its band edge transition with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 25.62 nm (60 meV). On the other hand, the CsPbCl3 sample showed a strong and intense peak at ∼2.90 eV with a FWHM of 20.39 nm (130 meV), where the peak positioning also matches well with the band gap of CsPbCl3. Aside from the different positioning of the luminescence peak, the relative intensity variation of these three halides is more interesting. Fig. 7b revealed that CsPbBr3 exhibited an improved emission intensity compared that of to CsPbI3. On the other hand, CsPbCl3 showed a more improved and high intensity peak as compared with that of CsPbBr3. Such intensity variation in the luminescence spectra was also detected in halide varied CH3NH3PbX3 thin films.53 The exact reason behind such intensity differences is still not clear, however, according to Zhang et al. this variation might be related to the orientation and vibration resistance of the cation in the perovskite lattice during halide variation.53,54 To simplify, a schematic of the CL emission and corresponding CL emission peak position for the three different perovskites is presented in the ESI,† Fig. S7. Fig. 7c displays a typical room temperature cathodoluminescence image for CsPBBr3 rods in monochromatic mode (right column), mimicking the FESEM image (left column) perfectly, which also confirms their high optical quality. Furthermore, by adjusting the stoichiometric composition of the perovskite we have tuned the correlating emission characteristics over the entire visible region in a subtle manner. With gradual increment in the I to Br ratio in the mixed halide CsPb(I/Br)3 samples, a repeating trend involving a red shift of the emission peak is observed, as depicted in Fig. 7d. A similar red shift in luminescence spectra for the variation of I concentration in CsPb(I/Br)3 mixed halides and a distributed spectra spreading from ∼500 nm to 700 nm were also noticed by Wang et al.52 In complete contrast, for the CsPb(Cl/Br)3 mixed halide samples the peaks are found to be blue shifted with increment of the Cl to Br ratio. With different Cl to Br ratios, similar spectral features have been witnessed by other researchers too.25,26 Hence, the as synthesized CsPbX3 samples exhibited composition-tunability over the whole visible spectral region. Such a repeating blue shift of the emission peak proceeding along the halide series I, Br and Cl is accompanied by unit cell contraction, however this shift does not depend linearly on the lattice contraction.55 It is worth mentioning here that the feasibility of other mixed halide perovskites like (Cl/I) is not reasonable due to the high mismatch of their ionic radii.10 For the facile understanding of the Cl and I concentration varied shifts of the emission peak, we have calculated the peak positions and with the assessed values we have plotted graphs correlating halide concentrations and peak positions, as portrayed in the ESI† (Fig. S8a and b). From the graphs, it is obvious that the changes in the CL peak position from CsPbCl3 to CsPbBr3 and CsPbBr3 to CsPbI3 follow a similar kind of linear correlation. Variation of the band gap due to halide alteration in the sample measured via a reflectance method and CL analysis is presented in the ESI,† Fig. S8c and d. From both graphs, a very nominal difference is observed for these two techniques which is in the experimental measurement limit. Finally, for easy comparative analysis we have tabulated the band gaps, CL peak positions and the FWHM values of each halide varied sample in Table 1.

Photoluminescence study
We have also investigated the room-temperature photoluminescence (PL) properties of the as-prepared samples. The PL emission spectra of the pure CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br or I) rods and mixed halide samples are depicted in the same figure (Fig. 8a). The PL emission spectra of the perovskite rods strongly depend on the halide composition and their stoichiometric ratio, which is obvious from the figure. CsPbCl3, CsPbBr3, and CsPbI3 rods are found to exhibit strong and narrow excitonic photoluminescence peaks at 2.97 eV (417 nm and FWHM ≈ 14.46 nm), 2.37 eV (523 nm and FWHM ≈ 23.51 nm) and 1.75 eV (707 nm and FWHM ≈ 19.15 nm), respectively. The absence of any defect related emission band in the spectra confirms that the observed PL emission is solely due to the near band-edge emission of the CsPbX3 samples. It is worth mentioning here that the peak positions and the FWHM values are obtained by the Gaussian fitting of the detected PL spectra. The PL emission spectra of other mixed halide samples with different ratios of Cl to Br are extended from ∼417–522 nm, whereas the spectra for the samples with different ratios of Br to I are distributed from ∼522–707 nm. Hence, the as-prepared all-inorganic perovskite rods exhibited optical color-tunability throughout the entire visible spectral window (∼417–707 nm), by simple composition modulation of the halides. With the increase of atomic number in halide elements from Cl to I, the bond strength between Pb and X decreases. As a consequence, the valence and conduction bands move closer to each other and this results in the reduction of the optical band gap. The as observed red shifting of the PL emission peak of the CsPbX3 rods with increasing halide concentration from Cl to Br to I is attributed to such a bandgap quenching phenomenon. Halide elements with a higher atomic radius in mixed samples increase the unit cell size and the covalency of CsPbX3. The FWHMs for our samples ranging from ∼108 to 141 meV agree well with the literature.56 The variation in the PL FWHM for the as synthesized CsPbX3 rods (∼14.46–23.51 nm) is much smaller than that for reported QDs,57,58 and aside from QD samples, the obtained FWHM values are also much lower than those for other reported vapor phase synthesized CsPbX3 structures (∼17–32 nm), as well as solution processed nanocrystals.33 These much lower FWHM values indicate the superior quality and good optical/excitonic properties of the as-grown rods compared to those in the discussed previous work. For easy understanding and comparison we have tabulated the PL peak positions and FWHM values of each halide varied sample in Table 2. From the table, the energy difference between the PL peak position and the excitonic transition observed from reflection spectroscopy is much smaller. Such a nominal red-shift of the PL peak signifies that the degree of disorder in the CsPbX3 samples is much less, which is corroborated well by the small values of the bowing parameters obtained from the XRD profiles of the samples. The differences in the FWHMs from the PL and CL spectra are related to exciton formation, which is possible for PL excitation but not feasible for CL excitation (as the excitation energy is very high). For the materials which have an exciton binding energy greater than room temperature, the energy equivalent (26 meV) PL decay is governed by exciton formation and hence has a lower value for the FWHM. However, for samples such as CsPbI3 (with an exciton binding energy of 20 meV) the PL FWHM is higher, as at room temperature the excitons are not stable. A CIE chromaticity diagram of the pure phase perovskite samples is shown in Fig. 8b, and confirms that the as-synthesized CsPbCl3 sample rods are luminescent in the blue region with the luminescence co-ordinates x = 0.25 and y = 0.22, CsPbBr3 rods are in the green region with the luminescence co-ordinates x = 0.28 and y = 0.65, and the rods of CsPbI3 are in the red zone with the luminescence co-ordinates x = 0.69 and y = 0.29. Finally, the PL quantum yields of pure CsPbX3 were measured and compared with previously reported yields to enlighten its significance in optoelectronics (please see the ESI,† Table S4).

Conclusions
In conclusion, by adopting a facile, environmentally benign, solution phase method under ambient conditions, we have successfully synthesized all-inorganic cesium lead halide perovskite 1D rods. The as grown CsPbX3 rods have a single crystalline structure. Using subtle variation of the halide element in this unique protocol, we have realized a series of CsPbX3 perovskite rods with single and multiple halide element compositions which exhibited wavelength tunable intense cathodoluminescence and photoluminescence emission over the entire visible spectral window. This high optical quality of the synthesized CsPbX3 rods indicates their potential applications in integrated photonic and optoelectronic devices. Using a suitable choice of precursor and with proper tunability of our synthetic parameters, it is reasonable to expect that the present protocols will pave the way towards the realization of other perovskite rods like AMX3 (A = MA+, Rb+ or Cs+; M = Zn2+, Ge2+ or Sn2+; X = F−, Cl−, Br−, I−, or a combination) as well.
