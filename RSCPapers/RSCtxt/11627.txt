    , Accepted 4th July 2016First published on 4th July 2016AbstractHere we report the synthesis and photocatalytic performance of a new series of n-type porous conjugated polymers (PCPs) based on perylene diimide (PDI) with band gap energies ranging from 1.54 to 2.25 eV. The corresponding structures and the properties of the prepared PCPs were fine-tuned by varying their copolymerization ratios. Their photocatalytic performances for hydrogen evolution from water in the presence of sacrificial agents were studied, and the results demonstrate that their catalytic efficiency is strongly monomer composition dependent. Namely, the incorporation of PDI and bipyridyl moieties into the network leads to the highest hydrogen evolution rate (∼7.2 μmol h−1), which is attributed to the better charge transport properties (coplanar structure) and better wettability properties of bpy-containing PCPs. Photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) dye by using these n-type PCPs as photocatalysts was also achievable. The photocatalytic degradation rate increases as the HOMO energy level of PCPs decreases, which implies that the degradation pathway is probably through oxidation by the photogenerated holes of PCPs.
Introduction
Porous conjugated polymers (PCPs) have attracted a lot of interest in the past few years due to their combination of high porosity and large surface areas with extended conjugation.1–6 The conjugation feature of the PCP network is unique and is not available in other porous materials. Since the report of the first PCP by Cooper et al. in 2007,1 various PCPs have been designed, synthesized and applied in energy-related areas such as light-harvesting,7 energy storage,8 singlet oxygen production,6 hydrogen evolution,9 pollutant degradation,10 and other photocatalysis processes,11–13 in addition to the typical applications of non-conjugated porous materials (such as gas separation5,14 and storage15,16). However, most of the previous studies only focused on p-type porous conjugated polymers, and only two examples of benzothiadiazole containing n-type PCPs have been reported so far.6,17
Perylene diimides (PDIs), among the most stable and popular organic conjugated units, have been widely used in high performance organic optoelectronic materials, such as organic field-effect transistors and organic solar cells.18–20 PDI-containing compounds exhibit several appealing properties including low cost, chemical robustness, a suitable optical absorption range, and strong electron deficiency. These merits make PDI derivatives very attractive in both industry and academia. To construct PDI-based PCP networks, the core part generally needs to be first functionalized with reactive groups, such as halogen atoms, for further carbon–carbon coupling. The reactive groups can be functionalized at the peri-(nitrogen atom), bay-(1, 6, 7 and 12 positions) or ortho-positions (2, 5, 8, and 11 positions). Work to date has shown that the introduction of the peri-functionalized PDI monomer will, to some degree, break the conjugation of the resultant polymers21 and the introduction of bay-functionalized PDI can result in strong twisting of the perylene core and steric hindrance issue.22 Recently, highly selective methods to functionalize the ortho-positions of PDI have opened up a facile synthetic route to prepare undistorted ortho-tetraborylated and ortho-tetrahalogenated PDI monomers for the construction of PDI-based porous conjugated materials.23,24 As the chemistry of ortho-substituted PDIs has been established just recently, the investigation of the properties of PDI-containing PCP networks in energy-related areas has not been systematically explored.
In this work, we report the preparation and photocatalytic performance of a series of PDI-based n-type PCPs. These PCPs are constructed by randomly copolymerizing quadrilateral building units 2,5,8,11-tetrabromo perylene diimide (PDI–Br4, M3) and 1,2,4,5-tetrabromobenzene (M4) with linear linkers 4,4′-diethynyl-1,1′-biphenyl (bph, M1) and 5,5′-diethynyl-2,2′-bipyridine (bpy, M2) via the Cu/Pd-mediated Sonogashira coupling reaction (Fig. 1). By varying the copolymerization ratios of the four comonomers, the physiochemical properties of PDI-based PCPs can be systematically varied. Detailed synthesis, characterization, their photocatalytic performances for hydrogen evolution from water and decolorization of methylene blue dye are described herein.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of PCPs
To systematically regulate the physical and chemical properties of the prepared PCPs, both weak donor biphenyl (bph, M1) and weak acceptor bipyridyl (bpy, M2) were introduced into the PCP networks. Tetrabromobenzene (M4) was used to change the relative molar content of the PDI unit in the network and to keep the crosslink-density constant. The detailed synthetic procedures and characterization for these monomers are described in the ESI.† To explore the effect of the monomer component based on the properties of the resultant PCPs, 3 sets of PDI-based PCP networks (13 samples) were synthesized by copolymerization of the diethynyl monomers (M1 and M2) and the tetrabromo monomers (M3 and M4) at different feed ratios via the Cu/Pd-catalyzed Sonogashira-coupling reaction (Fig. 1 and Table S1†). To simplify the discussion, they are named PCP1-x%PDI, PCP2-x%PDI and PCP3-x%bpy. For PCP1-x%PDI and PCP2-x%PDI samples, the molar content of PDI in the network was continuously varied by changing the M3/M4 feed ratio [x%/(1 − x%)], and x% represents the molar fraction of the PDI–Br4 monomer used in the polymerization; while for PCP3-x%bpy, PDI–Br4 was copolymerized with bph and bpy monomers at different feed ratios, and x% represents the molar fraction of the bpy monomer used in the polymerization.
First, the chemical structures of these PCPs were confirmed by combining FTIR spectral (Fig. 2) and elemental analysis (Table S2†) studies. The results clearly demonstrate that both the molar fractions of the PDI and bpy units in the network can be fine-tuned by varying the feed ratios of M3/M4 and M1/M2. Namely, for PCP1-x%PDI and PCP2-x%PDI, the stretching vibration strengths of the carbonyl group (CO) at 1696 and 1664 cm−1 gradually increase as the PDI content (x%) increases (Fig. 2b and c), and the vibration features of the aromatic rings belonging to the bph (1488 cm−1) and bpy (1463 cm−1) monomers are still obviously visible. For PCP3-x%bpy, all the spectra (Fig. 2d) show similar vibration strengths of the carbonyl group, accompanied by a gradual enhancement of stretching vibration of the pyridine ring (1463 cm−1) as bpy content increases. The peak located at ∼2210 cm −1 can be ascribed to the internal alkyne groups (R–CC–R). It is worth noting that the vibration feature of the alkyne end group (R–CC–H) which is typically located at 2100 cm−1 was not observed in this study,25 indicating that a high reaction conversion was achieved in the polymerization process. Elemental analysis results of PCPs-0%PDI and PCPs-100%PDI further support the structures proposed (Table S2†), and the deviation between the theoretical and experimental values is because of the incomplete combustion of the polymers and the residual end-group effect, which is normal for cross-linked conjugated systems.

The thermal stability of these PCPs was tested by TGA measurements under a N2 atmosphere. The results show that most of the PCPs are thermally stable up to 300 °C (Fig. S1†), and their thermal stability decreases as PDI or bpy content increases, and the mass retention ratio (WT=800 °C/W0) of these PCPs decrease with the contents of PDI and bpy units (Fig. S1d†). This trend is reasonable because the carbon–carbon bond normally shows a higher stability than the carbon–nitrogen or carbon–oxygen bonds. More quantitatively, ∼83% of the initial mass was maintained for PCP1-0%PDI at T = 800 °C, while only ∼57% of the initial mass was maintained for PCP2-100%PDI.
Morphological study
The porous properties of PCPs-0%PDI and PCPs-100%PDI were first investigated by nitrogen adsorption/desorption experiments at 77 K. The information on the surface area can be obtained using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) methods. The isotherm curves are shown in Fig. S2.† The apparent surface areas (SABET, P/P0 = 0.20) of PCP1-0%PDI, PCP1-100%PDI, PCP2-0%PDI and PCP2-100%PDI were estimated to be 372, 135, 415 and 355 m2 g−1, respectively. This result demonstrates that the introduction of the PDI unit into the network led to a remarkable decrease of the SABET for bph-based PCP1-x%PDI, but only led to a slight decrease for bpy-based PCP2-x%PDI. Overall, the PDI-based PCPs shown here are less porous than the previously reported PCPs, which is due to the crowded molecular structures of chromophore units bearing alkyl side chains and the longer linker monomers.2,5,26 Moreover, the nitrogen gas uptake at a low relative pressure (P/P0 < 0.05) reflects a microporous structure with a pore size smaller than 2 nm, but the sharp rise at high pressure regions (P/P0 = 0.9–1.0) indicates the presence of macropores (>50 nm) or absorbance at the external surface area in these materials. This observation is consistent with the pore size distribution curves obtained by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method (Fig. S2†).
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization of these networks also provides useful information about the morphological evolution as a function of molar fractions of PDI and bpy units incorporated in the network. Namely, for bph-based PCP1-x%PDI (Fig. 3a), a nanofiber-structure with an average diameter of ∼30 nm was observed for PCP1-0%PDI. As the PDI content (x%) increases, the individual fibers gradually grow and start to aggregate into bundles, which are finally fragmented into fused-sphere aggregates. In contrast, a structure evolution from sphere/short-fiber mixtures to long-fibers was observed for bpy-based PCP2-x%PDI when x% increases from 0% to 100% (Fig. 3b); moreover, the average diameter of the PCP2-100%PDI fiber structure is estimated to be ∼150 nm, much larger than that of PCP1-0%PDI. For PCP3-x%bpy (Fig. 3c), the solid state morphology undergoes a sphere-to-aggregated fiber-to-individual fiber transition as bpy content increases.

Scheme 1 illustrates how the morphology of the prepared PCP networks changes with the combination of different monomers. Obviously, the combinations of M1–M4 or M2–M3 led to a nanofiber-like structure, while the combinations of M1–M3 or M2–M4 led to a nanosphere-like structure. This structural difference may account for their different nitrogen adsorption properties. Though we do not at present fully comprehend these observed morphologies, the morphological difference between different PCPs has to originate from the different properties of monomers, such as the monomer size, solubility issue, coplanar property and polymerization kinetics. Nevertheless, the combination of coplanar PDI and bpy units led to the largest and longest nanofiber-structure, implying a more well-defined charge transport channel and better π–π stacking. This advantage is expected to improve the charge transport properties of the network, which is expected to be beneficial for the photocatalytic process (vide infra).

Optical property and energy diagram of PCPs
In semiconductor-mediated photocatalysis, excitons (electron–hole pairs) are generated through light absorption and dissociate into free charge carriers inducing redox reactions such as water splitting, CO2 fixation and degradation of organic pollutants. The width of the band gap along with the levels of conduction and valence bands represent crucial factors in order to make the photocatalytic process favourable. Before exploring the photocatalytic performances of these PDI-based PCP photocatalysts, their optical properties and energy level alignments were first investigated by combining UV-vis spectroscopy (Fig. 4a–c) and theoretical DFT calculation (Fig. 4d). The prepared PCPs show a colourful appearance ranging from light yellow to dark red (at the top of Fig. 4). Initial UV-vis spectroscopic study of these PCPs in PEG-300 suspension shows long tails in the long wavelength range of absorption profiles (Fig. S3†). This can be attributed to the scattering effect of large polymer particles. To eliminate this side effect, diffuse reflectance UV-vis measurements of the solid state of these PCPs were carried out to extract reliable optical absorption profiles. The results indicate that the introduction of PDI results in a redshift in the optical absorption onset for bph-based PCP1 (Fig. 4a), but results in a redshift–blueshift two-step transition for bpy-based PCP2 (Fig. 4b). For PDI-based PCP3 (Fig. 4c), the introduction of the bpy monomer results in a blueshift in the optical absorption onset. All these trends are attributed to the donor–acceptor “push–pull” effect. The optical bandgap (Eg) values of these PCPs are summarized in Table S3.† Overall, the Eg ranges from 1.54 to 2.25 eV. Attempts to further determine the LUMO and HOMO energy levels of these PCPs by using CV measurement failed due to the poor contact between the insoluble PCP and the electrode.

(d) The calculated energy level diagram (LUMO and HOMO) of fragmental structures of PCP photocatalysts, where LUMO and HOMO represent the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital and highest occupied molecular orbital. 
DFT calculations of the fragmental structures of PCP networks were carried out to gain insightful information about the relative HOMO and LUMO energy levels and the corresponding molecular orbital distribution. The results (Fig. S4†) demonstrate that the electron cloud can extend over both the HOMO and LUMO of PCP1-0%PDI and PCP2-0%PDI uniformly, but the bpy unit contributes more to the LUMO energy for PCP2-0%PDI than the biphenyl unit. For PCP1-100%PDI and PCP2-100%PDI, their HOMO and LUMO are individually separated, namely, HOMO is almost localized at the diethynyl unit while LUMO is localized at the PDI unit due to its electron-deficient nature. Fig. 4d demonstrates that both the calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels for these PCP fragments can be lowered by the introduction of PDI and bpy units due to their electron-deficient nature. Among them, PCP2-100%PDI shows the lowest HOMO (−6.0 eV) and LUMO (−3.6 eV) energy levels. In addition, the calculated trend of the bandgap agrees well with the experimental one. In all the calculations, the trans-configuration of the bpy unit was assumed due to its higher thermodynamic stability (coplanar structure) compared to that of the cis-configuration.27,28
Photocatalytic tests: hydrogen production
To explore the photocatalytic properties of these PCPs, the photocatalytic hydrogen production experiments were first carried out with these PDI-based PCPs in the presence of a sacrificial agent (SA). Considering the redox potential of H+/H2 ∼ 4.5 eV (vs. vacuum level), all of these PCPs exhibit enough driving force for hydrogen production (Fig. 4d). Before the photocatalytic experiment, the polymer sample was stirred in aqueous solution for 24 h to form a good suspension. The reaction temperature was maintained at room temperature by using two cooling fans. Methanol, diethanolamine (DEOA), diethylamine (DEA) and triethylamine (TEA) were tested as sacrificial agents (SAs), respectively. The best photocatalytic performance was achieved by using TEA as the SA when PCP1-100%PDI (1 mg mL−1) was used as the test photocatalyst (Fig. 5a). A linear relation between the irradiation time and the produced hydrogen amount was observed within 9 h (Fig. 5b and S5†), demonstrating a steady hydrogen production process. Control experiments with different PCP1-100%PDI concentrations (from 1.0 to 3.0 mg mL−1) showed a limited enhancement (1.3 times higher) of the hydrogen production rate (Fig. S6†), demonstrating that the concentration of the photocatalyst is capable of utilizing the incident photons. In addition, no obvious induction period was observed for the photocatalytic process. The intact photocatalysts were reflected in the unchanged FTIR and UV-vis spectra before and after photoreaction (Fig. S7,† PCP2-100%PDI).

(c) Photocatalytic hydrogen production rates of PCPs with different PDI (PCP1 and PCP2) or bpy (PCP3) contents under full-arc irradiation based on 3 h irradiation. 

Fig. 5c shows that the production rate was strongly dependent on the monomer composition. The results prove that the introduction of PDI led to a decrease of the hydrogen production rate for bph-based PCPs, but an increase for bpy-based PCPs. A maximum rate of 7.2 μmol h−1 was achieved in the case of PCP2-100%PDI, which is comparable with previously reported values for poly(p-phenylene) (3.0 μmol h−1),29,30 poly-(phenylene ethynylene) (1.0 μmol h−1)31 and poly(azomethine) (7.0 μmol h−1) systems.32 For comparison, inorganic melem, an active unit for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and also the building unit of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4),33 was also tested for a photocatalyst with a 2% Pt cocatalyst (Fig. S8†). A hydrogen production rate as high as 31.4 μmol h−1 was achieved by using exactly the same setup as the PCPs in this study, which is 4 times higher than the rate of PCP2-100%PDI. To further probe the effect of metal cocatalysts, we further tested the photocatalytic performance of PCP2-100%PDI loaded with 2 wt% Pt by photodeposition from K2PtCl6. Consequently, the activity for hydrogen production is enhanced ∼1.5 times and reaches a rate of 11.0 mmol h−1.
It is well known that multiple factors can influence the efficiency of hydrogen production, including light absorption, charge separation dynamics, charge transport, mass diffusion, cocatalyst concentration and surface chemical reactions. To gain more insight into the reason why the PCP2-100%PDI made of PDI and bpy moieties showed the best performance, the effect of the residual metal introduced during the Cu/Pd-catalyzed polycondensation process on photocatalytic activity was investigated. It was found that the residual Cu and Pd concentrations range from 0.2 to 1.2 wt% and 0.2 to 0.4 wt% for these PCPs, respectively; but no correlation was found between the hydrogen production rate and the metal content (Fig. 6). A similar result was previously reported by Cooper et al. for pyrene-based PCPs.9 Wettability tests were further carried out for these PCPs, and the results demonstrate that the wettability of PCP in amine/water solution can be slightly enhanced by the introduction of PDI and greatly enhanced by the introduction of a bpy moiety (Fig. S9†). The improvement of wettability will undoubtedly accelerate the mass diffusion in the polymer/water interface and facilitate the photocatalytic reaction. The coplanar structure of bpy-containing PCP is expected to increase the charge carrier mobility and to be beneficial for the photocatalytic reaction.34 All these advantages cause PCP2-100% to exhibit the highest photocatalytic activity in hydrogen evolution.

Photocatalytic tests: degradation of methylene blue
The photocatalytic activities of PDI-based PCPs are further evaluated by monitoring the decolourization of methylene blue (MB) dye. As shown in Fig. 7, PDI-containing PCP-100%PDI samples show significant activities for the decolourization of MB, while the two PCPs-0%PDI samples only show limited activity. The negligible MB degradation under light irradiation (without PCP) or in the dark (with PCP) implies that the decomposition of MB with the PCP-100%PDI photocatalyst is indeed a light-driven process (Fig. S10†). Among them, PCP2-100%PDI shows the highest photoactivity.
 Fig. 7  Retention concentration (C/C0) of the MB dye as a function of reaction time, where PCP1-0%PDI, PCP2-0%PDI, PCP1-100%PDI and PCP2-100%PDI were used as photocatalysts. 
Normally, the singlet oxygen (1O2), superoxide radical anion (O2˙−) and hydroxyl radical (OH˙) are reported to be the three most common active species involved in organic pollutant degradation, and the photocatalytic activities of a catalyst are highly substrate-specific and complex.34–37 On the other hand, the photogenerated holes are also capable of oxidizing the organic pollutant. By comparing the calculated HOMO level of PCP2-100%PDI (−6.0 eV) with the redox potential of H2O/OH˙ (−7.2 eV, ∼2.7 V vs. NHE), it is unlikely that the photogenerated holes react with surface-adsorbed water to produce hydroxyl radicals as strong oxidants for decomposition of MB dyes. It is worth noting that the maximum absorption peak (664 nm) of MB decreases without a blue shift during the degradation process (Fig. S11†). The hypochromic effect is normally observed when the dye molecules are degraded by the oxygen-containing radical species. Thus, the absence of the hypochromic effect implies that the degradation of MB tends to occur through oxidation by the photogenerated holes of PCP photocatalysts.37 For further confirming the hole-oxidation mechanism, control experiments were carried out to gain some insight into the photodegradation pathway. It is found that there is a decrease of ∼30% and ∼60% in the rate of MB degradation after the introduction of methanol and KI as hole-scavenger competitors, respectively (Fig. S12†). Further investigation of the role of O2 in the process of MB degradation shows that the degradation rate of MB with or without O2 was similar (Fig. S13†). The above two pieces of evidence are in accordance with the assumption that the photogenerated holes are responsible for the degradation of MB in aqueous solution. It is noted that bpy-containing PCP2-100%PDI exhibits the deepest HOMO energy level (−6.0 eV) and thus the strongest oxidation power among all the PCP photocatalysts, which qualitatively explains why PCP2-100%PDI presents the best catalytic activity.
Conclusions
In summary, a series of PDI-based n-type porous conjugated polymers (PCPs) was prepared, and all the PCPs showed photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production and pollutant degradation. The physiochemical properties of these PCPs, such as thermal stability, nitrogen adsorption properties, solid state morphology, light absorption, energy levels and the corresponding photocatalytic properties can be fine-tuned by changing the copolymerization ratio. The introduction of both PDI and bpy moieties into the network led to a better solid state morphology, an improvement of the wettability, a higher coplanarity, and a lower HOMO energy level. The photocatalytic study of these PCPs for hydrogen evolution and degradation of methylene blue dye implied that catalytic activity was mainly determined by charge transport properties, wettability in the interface and the energy levels of PCP photocatalysts. Considering the deep HOMO energy level of these n-type PDI-based PCP materials, they are also promising photocatalysts for the light-driven oxygen evolution process. Further study is in progress.
