    , Accepted 20th January 2017First published on 23rd January 2017AbstractFor solar cells, high open circuit voltage is necessary for their high output voltage. Usually, two methods are used to increase the open circuit voltage: using suitable and matched large band-gap materials and reduction of saturation current. Herein, large band-gap p-type ZnSe nanowires and n-type CdS films are used to construct core–shell p–n heterojunctions with high open circuit voltage. Furthermore, a 4 nm Si3N4 layer is inserted between the ZnSe core and the CdS shell in order to passivate the interface defects and to reduce recombination and the saturation current. Additionally, a fast annealing process is employed to reduce the series resistance for improved performance. For a typical device, an optimum high open circuit voltage of ∼1.3 V and an energy conversion efficiency of ∼5.27% were achieved for its photovoltaic operation. Moreover, tens of devices were fabricated to demonstrate their stable and consistent performance.
Introduction
Clean, renewable, and cheap energy has attracted the attention of the whole world in recent years owing to the shortage and depletion of the traditional energy sources. Solar cells, which can convert solar energy into electricity, are an important part of the next-generation energy strategy and have presented notable achievements.1,2 Inorganic, organic, and organic–inorganic hybrid solar cells have all contributed to the development of photovoltaic technology.3–9 There are several key parameters which determine the performance of solar cells, including open circuit voltage (VOC), short circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF) and so on. In addition we know that most of the effort was focused on increasing the short circuit current density by increasing light absorption, but much less attention was paid towards the open circuit voltage. Up to now, most single-junction solar cells have a low open circuit voltage, especially for solar cells based on II–VI semiconductors, the VOC is much lower than average, for instance, 0.5 V for Cu2S/CdS thin film solar cells,10 0.7 V for ZnO/ZnSe type II core–shell nanowire array solar cells,11 and 0.61 V for Cu2S/CdS single core–shell nanowire solar cells.12 It should be emphasized that solar cells with high open circuit voltages are beneficial to solar energy harvesting, both to drive electrochemical reactions and to function as high energy photon absorbers in a system with spectral splitting to improve the utilization of the solar spectrum.13,14 Generally, it is necessary to produce a suitable energy band structure from the constituent materials to obtain a high open circuit voltage for single-junction solar cells.15 Also, the open circuit voltage depends on the saturation current of the junction.16 The lower surface/interface carrier recombination and the reduced saturation current can lead to higher Voc. Therefore, low junction saturation current and energy band matched materials are important elements for the construction of high-performance solar cells with high open circuit voltage.
As wide direct band-gap II–VI semiconductors, ZnSe and CdS have important applications in various optoelectronic devices, such as photodetectors, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), laser diodes (LDs), and solar cells.1–4,13–24 For ZnSe, a moderate band gap of ∼2.7 eV at room temperature makes it suitable to absorb light from ultraviolet to blue. On the other hand, CdS with a band gap of ∼2.4 eV at room temperature could absorb green light effectively and has been broadly applied in heterojunction and quantum dot sensitized solar cells as an absorbing material.5,6,25–28 It is expected that the combination of ZnSe and CdS can offer a new solar cell sensitive to green-blue light which is the strongest spectral range for solar light. They are also promising candidates for the construction of solar cells with high open circuit voltage. However, CdS is mostly combined with a small band-gap semiconductor of CdTe (∼1.5 eV), forming n-CdS/p-CdTe solar cells. Their Voc is limited within a range of less than 0.82 V.29 The difficulty in achieving p-type doping in ZnSe and CdS films is the main obstacle for the realization of ZnSe and CdS homo-/hetero-junction solar cells.30 The difficulty in p-type doping is mainly due to the strong self-compensation effect in wide band-gap II–VI semiconductors.31 However, recent investigations have demonstrated that efficient p-type doping in ZnSe nanowires (ZnSe NWs) could be achieved by using group V elements of bismuth (Bi) or arsenic (As) as dopants.32,33
Inspired by the above progress, in this study, a new heterojunction solar cell was fabricated by combining p-type ZnSe NWs with n-type CdS films. Significantly, the p-ZnSe/n-CdS core–shell heterojunction exhibited excellent photovoltaic performance. Owing to the unique band structure of ZnSe and CdS, the open circuit voltage of the device could be as high as ∼1.3 V. Up to now, to the best of our knowledge, this has been the best result for the II–VI solar cells. After appropriate surface passivation and annealing, an optimum energy conversion efficiency of ∼5.27% was achieved for the heterojunction solar cells. Interestingly, the device on a flexible substrate could operate properly with large strain robustness. Our result demonstrates the great potential of the ZnSe/CdS core–shell heterojunctions to obtain solar cells with high open circuit voltage and high-efficiency.
Experimental details
Materials synthesis
p-Type ZnSe NWs were synthesized by thermal evaporation using ZnSe powder (Aldrich, 99.99%) as the source material and Bi powder (Aladdin, 99.99%) as the p-type dopant. For details refer to our previous work.26 Briefly, Bi powder (0.2 g) and ZnSe powder (0.3 g) were placed in sequence at upstream positions of the center of the quartz tube furnace at a distance, 10 nm Au coated silicon substrates were then placed at a downstream direction of ∼10 cm away from the ZnSe powder. 80 sccm Ar and H2 (5% in volume) mixed gas was used as the carrier gas, and the pressure in the tube was adjusted to ∼150 Torr before heating. The temperatures of the Bi powder, ZnSe powder and silicon substrates were maintained at ∼1040 °C, ∼900 °C, and ∼700 °C, respectively, during the experiment. A layer of a yellow wool-like product could be observed on the substrate surface after a growth duration of 1.5 h.
Device fabrication
The as-synthesized p-ZnSe NWs were first transferred from the donor substrates to the acceptor substrates (glass or PET) through a contact print process.34 Then, photolithography, e-beam evaporation, and lift-off process were performed to define Au (50 nm) ohmic contact electrodes at the two ends of ZnSe NWs. Afterwards, additional photolithography was conducted to define the pattern between two Au electrodes, and a Si3N4 layer (4 nm), a CdS film (45 nm), and a Ti electrode (15 nm) were fabricated in sequence by sputtering (Kurt J Lesker Company, PVD 75, 100 Watts, 4 min), atom layer deposition (ALD, Cambridge NanoTech Inc., Savannah 100 & 200, 600 circles), and e-beam evaporation, respectively. Eventually, the device was completed via a lift-off process.
Characterization
Morphologies of the heterojunctions were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, SIRION 200 FEG) and atomic force microscopy (AFM, Multimode V, Veeco). The electrical characteristics were measured using a semiconductor characterization system (Keithley 4200-SCS) on a probe station (M150, cascade). A blue/violet laser (70 mW cm−2, central wavelength at 430 nm) was used as the light source for detecting the photovoltaic behavior of the devices. All the measurements were taken at room temperature in air.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) and (b) show the SEM image of a typical p-ZnSe/n-CdS core–shell heterojunction on a glass substrate. The schematic illustration of the device is also displayed in Fig. 1(c). Au electrodes were deposited at the ends of the p-ZnSe NWs as anodes.35 In order to construct the heterojunctions, a Si3N4 layer (4 nm), a CdS film (45 nm), and a Ti electrode (15 nm) were deposited in sequence on the p-ZnSe NWs. The ultra-thin Si3N4 layer can serve as a passivation layer to enhance the photovoltaic performance of the heterojunction, which will be discussed later. The Ti layer acts as a cathode for the device; it is very thin so that most of the light can penetrate through it and reach the junction interface (Fig. S1 in the ESI†). By changing the density of NWs on the device substrate, the NW number in the device channel can be readily tuned from single to dozens of NWs. Actually, we found that the NW number mainly affected the device operating current, while having little influence on the device efficiency (discussed later).

Fig. 2(a) shows the AFM image obtained from the junction position. It is seen that the right part of the p-ZnSe NWs is encapsulated by a layer of a smooth CdS film. We note that the CdS film fabricated by the ALD technique is very uniform and compact. The surrounding of the CdS film on NWs can actually form a core–shell heterojunction structure (Fig. S4 in the ESI†), which could be very conducive to the carrier separation and transportation at the junction interface.36 Also, the thickness of the CdS film can be precisely controlled by adjusting the cycle number during the ALD film growth process. The capability to achieve core–shell heterojunction structures and the advantages of high uniformity and reliability make the ALD technique a promising approach to construct NW-based heterojunctions. Fig. 2(b) and (c) display the height distribution along the red line (A to B) and blue line (C to D), indicating heights of 95 nm and 45 nm for the ZnSe NWs and the CdS film, respectively.

Fig. 3(a) depicts the current–voltage (I–V) curve of a typical p-ZnSe/n-CdS core–shell heterojunction with 3 ZnSe NWs in the dark. For comparison, the device counterpart without a Si3N4 interfacial layer but with the same number of ZnSe NWs was also detected. Notably, the device without the Si3N4 interfacial layer exhibits poor rectifying characteristics; the rectification ratio is ∼3.5 at ±5 V. The ideality factor (n) and the series resistance could be deduced to ∼8.1 and 550 MΩ based on the Shockley–Read equation37,38 (the calculation methods can be found in the ESI†). This value of n is much larger than that for an ideal diode (n = 1), implying a large recombination ratio at the junction interface.39

(b) I–V curves of the heterojunctions with and without Si3N4 layers under light illumination (70 mW cm−2, central wavelength ∼ 430 nm). 
In contrast, when an ultrathin Si3N4 layer is introduced between the ZnSe core and the CdS shell, the junction characteristics are significantly improved; the rectification ratio is increased to ∼20 while the ideality factor and the series resistance are reduced to ∼1.65 and 350 MΩ. I–V curves under light illumination verify the performance improvement after insertion of a Si3N4 layer (Fig. 3(b)). The above results unambiguously demonstrate that the Si3N4 interfacial layer plays a positive role in enhancing the diode performance of the heterojunction.
When the CdS film is directly deposited on the ZnSe NWs, defects should be generated at the interface. The defects would act as recombination centers and transport channels, leading to a large leakage current and consequently degradation of the device performance.40 The Si3N4 layer can serve as a passivation layer to suppress the activity of the interface defects and reduce the leakage current.
Under blue/violet light (70 mW cm−2, central wavelength ∼ 430 nm) illumination, the p-ZnSe/n-CdS core–shell heterojunction exhibits pronounced photovoltaic behavior. Fig. 4(a) shows the photovoltaic behaviors of a typical device (with 10 ZnSe NWs) which has one of the best performances out of dozens of devices. Before annealing, the short circuit current density (JSC), VOC, and fill factor (FF) are deduced to be 3.88 mA cm−2, 1.5 V, and 0.277, respectively, yielding a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.3% for the device. However, more significant improvement on device performance was achieved after a fast annealing process at 350 °C for 5 min; JSC and FF increase to 9.86 mA cm−2 and 0.29, while VOC slightly decreases to 1.3 V, giving rise to a high PCE of 5.27%. Fig. 4(b) depicts the photoresponse characteristics of the devices at zero bias. It should be noted that the annealed device possesses a higher photocurrent but a lower dark current. The device shows high sensitivity to incident light with a large Ion/Ioff ratio of ∼105 and a fast response speed of ∼3 s (the response speed herein is estimated by the instrument’s limit), implying that photogenerated electron–hole pairs could be effectively separated at the heterojunction area. Considering the excellent reproducibility and stability of the device under pulsed light illumination, the device may function as a high-performance, self-powered photodetector working in the blue UV range. As for the important role of annealing in enhancing the device performance, it could be ascribed as follows: (i) annealing could improve the crystal quality of the CdS film and reduce the defects in it. As a result, the carrier recombination in the CdS film is reduced and more carriers can be effectively collected by the electrode. (ii) Defects at the junction interface are decreased after annealing. The decrease of recombination centers can lead to the increase of photocurrent. (iii) Annealing is beneficial to the improvement of electrical contacts and consequently the increase of the photocurrent.

For high open circuit voltage of the devices, the large band gaps of ZnSe (2.7 eV) and CdS (2.4 eV) cause a large difference in the Fermi energy level (more than 1.7 eV) and result in a large open circuit voltage (>1 V). Meanwhile, less recombination at the interface after the insertion of the Si3N4 layer makes the leakage current lower and contributes to the high open circuit voltage of the devices (Table 1) as shown in the following equation: (1)where IL is the photocurrent and ID is the dark current consisting of the reverse saturation current and leakage current caused by recombination at the interface.

To gain deeper insights into the photovoltaic behavior of the p-ZnSe/n-CdS core–shell heterojunctions, Fig. 5(a) and (b) illustrate the energy band diagram and current flow of the heterojunction under light illumination, respectively. Because of the difference in the Fermi level (EF), a space charge region, as well as a built-in electric field, will be established at the heterojunction interface. Upon light irradiation, photo-generated electron–hole pairs will be separated by the built-in electric field; the carriers will drift in the space charge area, diffuse into the semiconductors, and then be collected by the electrodes. In general, the short circuit current includes the following parts: the electron diffusion current I1 as minority carriers in the p-ZnSe core and the hole diffusion current I2 as minority carriers in the n-CdS shell, the photo-generated currents in the junction area I3 (current contributed by electrons) and I4 (current contributed by holes), and the electron current (I5) and the hole current (I6) due to recombination through defects at the interface.41,42 As a result, ISC could be simply summed up as the following equation: ISC = I1 + I2 + I3 + I4 − I5 − I6(2)

Since ZnSe and CdS have selective band gaps that could absorb blue/green light, which is the strongest region of solar light, the p-ZnSe/n-CdS core–shell heterojunctions are very efficient for the utilization of sunlight and result in large I1, I2, I3, and I4. On the other hand, the existence of the Si3N4 interfacial layer can effectively suppress the recombination at the junction interface and thus contribute to the reduced I5 and I6. For these reasons, the p-ZnSe/n-CdS core–shell heterojunctions in this work exhibit much improved photovoltaic performance.
While an individual device that demonstrated remarkable photovoltaic performance has been discussed above, fourteen other devices containing different numbers of ZnSe NWs were investigated to demonstrate their stability and universality. Fig. 6(a) and (b) describe the relationship between the short circuit current, the open circuit voltage and the number of ZnSe NWs in an individual device. The scattered symbols in Fig. 6(a) are experimental data and the red solid line is the fitting result, which reveals that the ISC increases linearly with increasing number of NWs. In other words, the short circuit current density remains at a certain range no matter how many NWs exist in an individual device. Fig. 6(c) shows the JSC histogram of all the fifteen devices and indicates that the range of 4–13 mA cm−2 covers the JSC of most of the fifteen devices. Meanwhile, Fig. 6(b) shows the experimental data of open circuit voltage distribution and its histogram is shown in Fig. 6(d). All the above depict that most of the devices have a high VOC in the range of 0.9–1.2 V, while the highest value is observed to be ∼1.3 V. Furthermore, a statistical average conversion efficiency of ∼3.46% was calculated using the average JSC, VOC, and FF of 7.96 mA cm−2, 1.05 V, and 0.29, respectively. These results show that the devices have steady and high photovoltaic performance. This means that assembly and large-scale integration could be a viable strategy by using p-ZnSe/n-CdS core–shell heterojunctions as building blocks.

Light weight, low-cost, and flexibility are the main features of the next-generation optoelectronic devices. In this work, p-ZnSe/n-CdS core–shell heterojunction based flexible solar cells were fabricated on PET substrates by using the same process described above. Fig. 7(a) shows the measurement setup of the device. To detect the bending stability of the device, the PET substrate was stuck on the surface of a pen (diameter of 1.3 cm). Therefore the bending substrate has a curvature of ∼1.54 cm−1. Fig. 7(b) depicts the schematic illustration of the device in the bending state. From Fig. 7(c), we note that the device on the PET substrate shows large performance degradation as compared to the device on the glass substrate; the efficiency is estimated to be ∼0.99%, in contrast to the much larger value of 5.27% on glass. The lack of annealing and the worse electrical contact on the PET substrate could be responsible for this result. Despite the performance degradation, the VOC of the flexible device remains about 1 V in the flat state. More importantly, the device exhibits excellent bending stability to resist tensile strain. The device efficiency decreases slightly from ∼0.99% in the flat state to ∼0.94% in the bending state. Furthermore, the photoresponse of the device at zero bias was investigated in the flat and bending states, respectively (Fig. 7(d)). The photoresponse curve of the device in the bending state nearly overlaps that in the flat state, indicating the high stability and reproducibility of the flexible device. Our results demonstrate the great potential of the p-ZnSe/n-CdS core–shell heterojunctions for flexible solar cells with high open circuit voltage.

Conclusions
In conclusion, a new type of heterojunction was constructed using Bi-doped p-ZnSe NWs and n-CdS films and showed excellent photovoltaic performance. Both inexpensive glass and flexible PET were used as their substrates. In order to improve the performance of the devices, an ultra-thin Si3N4 layer was inserted between ZnSe NWs and CdS films to passivate their interface defects while a fast annealing process was carried out to reduce the series resistance. For a typical device, an ideality factor (n) of ∼1.65 of the heterojunction was obtained. Meanwhile, a high open circuit voltage of ∼1.3 V and an energy conversion efficiency of ∼5.27% were achieved. Furthermore, devices fabricated on the PET substrate were also investigated to show their stable performance when bent. The stability and universality of performance indicates that p-ZnSe/n-CdS core–shell heterojunctions could be building blocks for large-scale flexible solar cells and promote the development of next-generation optoelectronic devices.
