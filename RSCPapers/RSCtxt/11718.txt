    , Accepted 27th October 2017First published on 27th October 2017AbstractWe report on submicron organosilicate barrier films produced rapidly in air by a scalable spray plasma process that improves both the stability and efficiency of perovskite solar cells. The plasma is at sufficiently low temperature to prevent damage to the underlying layers. Oxidizing species and heat from the plasma improve device performance by enhancing both interfacial contact and the conductivity of the hole transporting layer. The thickness of the barrier films is tunable and transparent over the entire visible spectrum. The morphology and density of the barrier are shown to improve with the addition of a fluorine-based precursor. Devices with submicron coatings exhibited significant improvements in stability, maintaining 92% of their initial power conversion efficiencies after more than 3000 h in dry heat (85 °C, 25% RH) while also being resistant to degradation under simulated operational conditions of continuous exposure to light, heat, and moisture. X-ray diffraction measurements performed while heating showed the barrier film dramatically slows the formation of PbI2. The barrier films also are compatible with flexible devices, exhibiting no signs of cracking or delamination after 10000 bending cycles on a 127 μm substrate with a bending radius of 1 cm.
Introduction
Organometal halide perovskites exhibit remarkable optoelectronic properties with a high tolerance for defects, enabling low-cost, high efficiency, solution-processable photovoltaic devices.1–3 Recent cost-modeling predicts perovskite modules will be less expensive than c-Si to manufacture;4–6 however, their chemical instability, moisture sensitivity, and mechanical fragility currently limit their service lifetime and viability as a reliable solar technology.7–9 Research efforts have begun to shift focus from maximizing efficiency—which is now above 22% for the best-performing devices10—to improving stability,11 both at elevated temperatures12 and under operational conditions for up to 1 year.13
Photoactive perovskites suffer from three main chemical degradation pathways: (1) moisture ingress, which decomposes the perovskite; (2) thermally induced volatility of the organic cation; and (3) corrosion of metal electrodes from halide reactions.14 Methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3)—the drosophila of photoactive perovskite materials—is particularly susceptible to these environmental stressors,15 along with synergistic effects involving illumination while in air.7 In an effort to improve the stability of the perovskite layer to heat,16 moisture,17 and light,18 as well as to tune its electronic properties,19 a number of different perovskite compounds featuring many different organic and inorganic components have been studied. Yet MAPbI3 remains highly relevant in the literature and the simplest perovskite composition to fabricate because it requires only two precursors.
Device encapsulation plays a key barrier function from the harsh environmental stressors to which devices operating in the field are subjected and is an integral component of any solar module. Perovskite encapsulation has typically been limited to laminating the device with the industry standard ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) between two thick glass panes, a configuration reported to fully shield the perovskite solar cells under damp heat conditions.20 An alternative encapsulant to glass panes was demonstrated in a recent study using a 5 μm-thick, spin-coated, UV-curable fluoropolymer as a barrier film that achieved significant improvements in lifetime under continuous illumination for several months.21 Although these results demonstrate promising avenues for improving device stability, these methods require encapsulants with thicknesses ranging from several μm up to several mm—thicknesses significantly greater than all other layers of the device combined. Furthermore, one of the primary benefits of perovskite solar cells is their compatibility with flexible substrates,22 and these encapsulation techniques are unlikely to be well-suited for deformation or bending.
As the field of perovskites moves toward commercialization, the manufacture of devices through scalable deposition methods becomes increasingly important. Efforts are underway to transition beyond spin-coating to scalable deposition methods, and devices with active areas up to 100 cm2 have been produced through various combinations of slot-die, blade, and spray coating techniques.23–25 A one-step process was used in this study to deposit submicron barrier films for perovskite encapsulation (Fig. 1), leveraging a deposition method recently developed by our group, rapid spray plasma processing (RSPP), which enabled fabrication of submicron barrier films in open air on substrates at a rate of >20 cm s−1 that is compatible with flexible substrates and improves both the efficiency and stability of devices.
 Fig. 1  The barrier deposition method used in this paper was a variation of rapid spray plasma processing (RSPP) in which the barrier precursors, HMDSO and TFT were mixed and sprayed at the leading edge of a compressed air plasma. This spray and plasma were swept over the entire device to create submicron barrier films. 
Results and discussion
Barrier film properties
Dense, pinhole-free organosilicate barrier films were deposited by RSPP directly onto perovskite solar cells. The film precursors were hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO), a common precursor for depositing organosilicate films, and trifluorotoluene (TFT), a fluorinated aromatic typically used as a solvent rather than a precursor as we have done here.26 TFT was utilized as a second precursor because of its fluorination, which we anticipated would decrease the water wettability of the barrier, and our observation that films fabricated with TFT as a precursor were more stable than those without. Furthermore, films in which only one precursor was used (i.e., HMDSO or TFT) were found to be ineffective barrier layers. Films fabricated from pure HMDSO tended to fracture and delaminate from the devices (Fig. S1a†), while those fabricated from pure TFT resulted in poor film formation due to a significantly decreased rate of deposition (Fig. S1b†). We chose HMDSO instead of more traditional organosilicate precursors such as tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) due to the higher deposition rate of HMDSO-based films, improved film morphology, and ability to incorporate higher carbon content to increase film plasticity.27 Similar attempts at TEOS-based barriers resulted in cracking and debonding.
The morphology of the organosilicate barrier layer was optimized by adjusting the precursor ratio of TFT to HMDSO; the amount of TFT added was varied from 0 to 75% by vol (these organosilicate barriers are abbreviated OBTx for the remainder of this manuscript, where x is the % by vol TFT added and 100 − x is the % by vol HMDSO added). The morphologies and densities of the barrier films were characterized with cross-sectional SEM. Rough barrier layers with hemispherical surface features were observed for TFT concentrations of 25% and below. These features were eliminated for OBT50 (Fig. S2†), but increasing the TFT concentration further led to noticeably reduced layer thicknesses due to lower deposition rates (Fig. S3†). A (false-colored) cross-sectional SEM of an OBT50 completed device (Fig. 2a) with corresponding top-down views before (Fig. 2b) and after the deposition of the barrier film (Fig. 2c) shows that the barrier reduced surface roughness. The film thicknesses were tunable by the number of deposition passes (cycles) over the device; a deposition of 15 cycles with a precursor solution comprising 50% HMDSO and 50% TFT rapidly produced a pinhole-free film ∼200 nm thick.

(b) A top-down micrograph of the gold electrode on top of the device stack before coating with a barrier, demonstrating its inherent roughness, and (c) a gold electrode after coating with the barrier which is less rough. 
The transparency of the barrier films was determined by measuring their UV-vis transmission spectra. Due to the high absorbance of perovskite, the films for these measurements were deposited on top of only crosslinked poly(triarylamine) (PTAA)/ITO-glass substrates rather than full devices. These substrates simulated the surface of deposition for the full devices, ensuring similar morphologies of the barrier film. When compared to an uncoated control, the barrier films were highly transparent for a range of thicknesses and for OBT10–OBT75 (Fig. S4 and S5†). Surprisingly, the transparency increased compared to the control for large ranges of the visible spectrum, which was possibly due to functionality as an anti-reflection coating or an effect of the plasma interacting with the PTAA layer and altering the film chemistry and optical properties, which will be discussed in more detail below. This excellent transparency has applications in semitransparent and tandem devices—where illumination would be incident on the barrier film—or module scale devices that use finger electrodes rather than pad electrodes. Since SiO2 inhibits the transmission of UV-B and UV-C radiation, an ancillary benefit of these organosilicate barriers is the potential to shield the solar cell from high energy UV photons, which have been shown to significantly degrade perovskite solar cells.1,28,29
The incorporation of fluorine into the barrier films by the addition of the TFT precursor was anticipated to increase the barrier water-resistance. As expected, the fluorine content in the barrier films increased with TFT precursor concentration, and was ∼3% for OBT50 as determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Fig. S6†). We studied how this increasing fluorine content correlated with the water contact angles (WCAs) of the films. Pristine PTAA was found to have a WCA ∼75°, while OBT1, OBT10, and OBT25 barriers deposited from 15 cycles exhibited WCAs above 90°, meaning the encapsulated device became hydrophobic (Fig. S7†). We attributed this hydrophobicity to the previously mentioned hemispherical surface features. Decreased WCAs were observed in OBT50 and OBT75, which we attributed to the smoother film morphology, apparently a dominant mechanism over the increased fluorine content. These observations indicated that the incorporation of TFT was more useful for controlling morphology than increasing hydrophobicity. However, the precursors used have the potential for superhydrophobicity by engineering film roughness, as we observed coatings on silicon with a water contact angle above 140° (Fig. S8†). These films could be used for applications in microfluidics and self-cleaning surfaces.30
Device performance improvement
An increase in device power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.5–1.0% was observed after deposition of the organosilicate barriers, independent of the precursor ratio. A consistent increase in both Voc and FF was observed after barrier deposition for all devices tested, and the J–V curves of a representative device both before and after deposition are shown in Fig. S9.† One potential mechanism for this improvement in performance could be an enhancement of the PTAA/electrode interfacial contact due to thermal annealing of the PTAA from the plasma heat. Previously, increased interfacial contact has been shown to improve charge extraction in organic photovoltaics.31
Another possible mechanism for device improvement is the oxidation of the Li-based dopant in the PTAA, which has previously been shown to increase film conductivity.32 The plasma generates reactive species from a compressed air source, so it is probable that the PTAA dopant was oxidized. In order to further probe this potential mechanism, PTAA films (with and without crosslinking) were exposed to the bare plasma for various cycles and sheet resistance measurements were made to quantify the change in film conductivity (Fig. S10†). Without plasma treatment, the PTAA sheet resistance exceeded the testing limit for our experimental setup, which was 900 MΩ □−1. After exposure to a cycle or more of the plasma, the sheet resistance dropped to ∼100 MΩ □−1 and remained around this value for up to 20 cycles. This improved film conductivity coupled with the observation that the transparency increased for barrier-coated PTAA/ITO-glass substrates were indications of a strong plasma interaction with the PTAA.
To further investigate the oxidation of the PTAA by plasma, we prepared PTAA films on glass and performed XPS survey scans before and after one and five cycles of plasma exposure without depositing any precursor material (Fig. S11†). This experiment simulated the maximum amount of plasma exposure to the samples, because as the barrier deposition occurs, it quickly forms a contiguous film that shields the PTAA from the plasma. Comparing the XPS survey scans, a noticeable increase in the relative concentration of oxygen was observed, from 8% before plasma exposure to 23% after one cycle and 28% after five cycles (Fig. S12†). Furthermore, the relative concentration of fluorine doubled after one cycle and tripled after five cycles, indicating that the Li-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) dopant—the only source of fluorine in the film—was not volatilized from plasma exposure, and rather, the film chemistry was changed from interactions with the plasma.
Evaporated and sputtered SiO2 films were also deposited on completed devices to see if other barrier deposition methods would also result in an improved device performance. A noticeable decrease in PCE occurred after e-beam evaporation of SiO2, while sputtering resulted in a similar increase to the RSPP deposition of organosilicate barrier films (Fig. S13†). These results suggested that plasma exposure was a key component in the improved device performance.
Stability of barrier coated devices

Accelerated aging in damp heat. 
The optimum film chemistry for device stability was determined by exposing devices coated with barrier films deposited from various precursor ratios (i.e., OBT0 up to OBT75) to accelerated aging in damp heat conditions (85 °C, 85% RH). The normalized PCE was then measured as a function of exposure time for devices coated with 15 deposition cycles and an uncoated control (Fig. 3). The harsh conditions of this accelerated aging resulted in immediate degradation of the control device, which fully converted to PbI2 in less than 1 h of exposure. All barrier-protected devices demonstrated a marked improvement in stability by at least an order of magnitude.
 Fig. 3  Normalized PCE of devices undergoing accelerated damp heat aging at 85 °C and 85% RH. Uncoated devices degraded almost immediately. Devices coated with barriers formed from very high (OBT75) and low (below OBT25) precursor concentrations of TFT exhibited poor stability, while those coated with barriers formed from OBT50 maintained 55% of their initial efficiency after 150 h exposure. 
As observed in the SEM images in Fig. 2, OBT50 produced a dense, smooth layer while maintaining a high deposition rate. This 1:1 ratio of TFT:HMDSO improved stability by over two orders of magnitude, and 55% of the initial PCE was retained after 150 h (Fig. S14†). These devices also remained operational when fully submerged in water, compared to a control device which quickly decomposed into PbI2 (Fig. S15†). OBT25 devices also retained 42% of their initial PCE after 105 h exposure to damp heat.
The OBT75 were insufficient barriers to moisture ingress, due to the low deposition rate and resulting thinness, and failed around the 10 h mark. Devices coated with barriers formed from OBT10 and below also suffered from degradation, although the mechanism for failure of these barriers was not their thinness, but rather their increased film roughness and barrier cracking which allowed a direct pathway for moisture to the devices.


Accelerated aging in dry heat. 
Devices were also aged in dry heat (85 °C, 25% RH) to simulate the extreme temperatures and relatively dry conditions encountered in arid climates. The performance of a device coated with OBT25 (15 deposition cycles) as a function of exposure time was compared to an uncoated control (Fig. 4). The barrier-protected device increased in PCE over the first 500 h, possibly due to improvements in the device interfacial contacts or increased perovskite crystallinity,20 and after 3176 h, 92% of the initial PCE was retained. Conversely, the efficiency of the unprotected device declined sharply to 50% of the initial PCE after only 150 h, and 10% after 3176 h.
 Fig. 4  Normalized PCE of devices undergoing accelerated dry heat aging at 85 °C and 25% RH. The uncoated device degraded to 50% of its initial efficiency within 150 h and 10% after 3176 h, while the OBT25 device retained 92% of its original efficiency after 3176 h. Insets: photographs of the front of the devices and the back side of the pixels after device exposure for only 1000 h. 
Insets in Fig. 4 show top-down photographs of the devices after 1000 h; the barrier layer was highly effective at preventing methylammonium egress, while the unprotected perovskite visibly degraded to a yellow PbI2 film from temperature-induced methylamine evolution. Additional insets in Fig. 4 are photographs of the underside of the Au electrode after 1000 h retaining a dark color indicating an intact perovskite layer with no signs of the PbI2 formation that accounted for the steep PCE degradation during the aging test for the unprotected perovskite device.
To quantify the improvement in thermal stability of barrier-protected devices, in situ X-ray diffraction measurements were performed for uncoated control films, OBT25, and OBT50 on a heated stage at 150 °C, 165 °C, or 180 °C (Fig. 5a–f and S16†) for at least one hour. Perovskite degradation was tracked by integrating the peak intensity for the MAPbI3 (100) (Fig. 5h and S17†) and the PbI2 peaks (Fig. 5g and S17†). At all temperatures, the rate of perovskite degradation was higher for the uncoated controls than for the OBT25 or OBT50 protected devices. Under these conditions, OBT25 and OBT50 performed roughly equivalently, with very little perovskite degradation observed.

This change in integrated peak intensity from the XRD scans is quantified and plotted for control, OBT25, and OBT50 while heated at 150 °C, 165 °C, and 180 °C showing (g) the PbI2 growth rate and (h) the (100) cubic MAPbI3 degradation rate as a function of time extracted from 2D data.

An Arrhenius model was used to extract the activation energy for the formation of PbI2,  (Fig. 5i).  convolutes different energy transfer, energy dissipation, and diffusion processes which occur in a multi-layer device under thermal stresses, quantifying the macroscopic resistance of the perovskite solar cell to degradation. The calculated values of  for OBT25 and OBT50 were larger than that of the control by 0.15 and 0.24 eV, respectively, indicating that the barrier film increased the resistance of the perovskite to forming PbI2 and thus improved thermal stability.
In order to further investigate the mechanism for improved stability with the barrier film, we used depth profiling with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements to characterize the samples exposed to 180 °C for 1 h. We compared an OBT25-protected sample to an uncoated sample as well as an unexposed and uncoated control sample. Of particular interest was the iodine signal, as it could be used to track the location of methylammonium iodide (MAI). In the unaged control film, iodine was present only in the perovskite layer (Fig. S18a†). However, in both exposed samples, there was a clear increase in the iodine signal within the PTAA layer (Fig. S18b†), indicating that MAI volatilized from the perovskite film and saturated the PTAA before escaping the device. The iodine signal in the PTAA was lower in the OBT25-protected sample than in the uncoated sample, an interesting observation that warrants further study. Furthermore, no iodine was observed in the barrier film itself (Fig. S18c†), indicating that the barrier prohibits MAI diffusion.


Operational conditions. 
The synergistic contributions of multiple environmental stressors as would be experienced in the field was simulated by exposing devices to light, heat, and moisture simultaneously. OBT50-protected and uncoated devices were placed on a hot plate at 85 °C in ambient conditions (∼40% RH) under a bright microscope light (4230 W m−2) and periodically imaged while tracking the CH3NH2 signal (m/z = 31) with in situ gas phase mass spectrometry (GP-MS). For the uncoated device, a noticeable peak in the mass spectrometry signal appeared after nearly 40 min on the hot plate, indicating cation egress from the exposure (Fig. S20a†), an effect which was further demonstrated on perovskite films to prove methylamine volatility (Fig. S21†). This peak corresponded with a noticeable appearance of device yellowing only in the region exposed to the light, while the rest of the device remained dark, showing accelerated degradation from the combined effects of the light, heat, and moisture. Micrographs verified that the color change occurred just prior to the detection of methylamine by mass spectrometry (Fig. S19†). The delay between optical detection and detection through GP-MS was attributed to the diffusion of the organic species through the PTAA. Addition of the OBT50 barrier increased stability and no peak in the CH3NH2 signal or yellowing in the micrographs was observed during the experiment. Furthermore, no sign of perovskite yellowing was evident after 40 h of continuous exposure (Fig. S20b†).


Mechanical stress. 
In order to demonstrate compatibility with roll-to-roll processing and the associated flexural stresses during device fabrication, we performed bending tests of OBT25 and OBT50 (15 cycles) barrier films—the conditions which yielded the best stability for dry and damp heat, respectively—on 127 μm thick PTAA/polyimide substrates (Fig. S22†). A photograph of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. S23a,† and the displacement vs. time is plotted in Fig. S23b.† A bending radius of 1 cm was used, which generated a maximum flexural strain of 6.4% on the film. Micrographs of the film after various bending cycles are shown in Fig. 6 with no cracking or delamination observed in OBT25 or OBT50 samples after 10000 bending cycles, and visible deterioration in either film was not observed until 20000 bending cycles. Other work has reported degradation in device performance after far fewer cycles due to poor ITO adhesion to flexible substrates.33,34 Our work is the first demonstration of a perovskite solar cell encapsulant that is highly robust under bending, showing that RSPP barrier films are entirely suitable for flexible devices.
 Fig. 6  Optical micrographs of barrier films deposited on PTAA on a flexible polyimide substrate with (a) OBT25 and (b) OBT50, showing no change in the film after 10000 cases in both cases. After 20000 cycles, noticeable cracking was observed. 
The adhesion of the barrier to the underlying PTAA is an important factor for device reliability and was measured using a double cantilever beam test (Fig. S24†). For OBT0 films, a relatively low adhesion energy, or Gc, of 0.41 J m−2 was measured, corroborating the observed delamination in devices coated with pure HMDSO (Fig. S1†). Gc increased to 2.41 J m−2 for OBT25 and then decreased to 1.50 J m−2 for OBT50, the change in which was attributed to decreased film plasticity for the thinner OBT50 films. These Gc values are larger than all planar perovskite films,35 indicating that the barrier is more robust than the perovskite layer.

Outlook
The obstacle limiting the successful commercialization of perovskite solar cells is the ability to produce large-scale, environmentally stable devices. Tuning perovskite compositions with various cations has improved stability to an extent36—state-of-the-art devices are still not fully resistant to heat and moisture—and there is a need for low-cost, scalable, thin-film encapsulants. The following design principles are critical when considering the optimal perovskite encapsulant:
Thickness
A key advantage of perovskites over current commercialized photovoltaic (PV) modules is their compatibility with lightweight and/or flexible devices. To capitalize on this potential for perovskite devices, it is necessary to dramatically reduce the bulk of the encapsulant, which is the majority of the 30 kg a 300 W PV module can weigh.37 This reduction in encapsulant thickness will ensure costs remain lower than other solar technologies.
Scalability
Solution-processed deposition methods such as spray coating can provide flexibility in the selection of materials, allowing for the deposition of the perovskite, associated charge transport layers, and encapsulant from a single tool. This spray-coating method is highly scalable, unlike currently utilized spin coating methods, making it a feasible option for the encapsulation of module-scale devices.
Transparency
Encapsulant multifunctionality can be realized by using materials that are transparent across the visible and IR spectra for compatibility with the remarkable potential of perovskite tandems.20 Oxide materials are particularly attractive because the encapsulation can be used to coat the front side of devices as an anti-reflection coating. Furthermore, the UV-absorbing properties of oxides can protect against UV-induced degradation in perovskite devices.
Conclusion
We have demonstrated spray-plasma deposition of barrier films as a highly tunable method to improve both device stability and efficiency. By varying the precursor ratio, we found large effects on the morphology and chemistry of the barrier films, ranging from rough, hydrophobic coatings for OBT0–OBT25 to extremely smooth, slightly hydrophilic coatings for OBT50–OBT75. The film thickness was related to the number of passes of the spray-plasma apparatus over the substrate, allowing thicknesses ranging from a few 10 s of nm to nearly 1 μm.
Devices with organosilicate barriers exhibited increased efficiencies and significantly improved stabilities to extreme heat and moisture under conditions of 85 °C and either 25% or 85% RH. The optimal barriers exhibited no visible cracks after over 10000 bending cycles at 1 cm bending radius—enabling compatibility with flexible, lightweight devices on plastic substrates. Although significant attention has been used to develop alternative perovskite materials that are intrinsically more stable, this approach effectively shielded the highly unstable MAPbI3 from environmental stressors with a thin-film barrier. The protection these barriers provide are independent of the underlying device and should translate to any perovskite device architecture. Furthermore, spray-plasma deposition is capable of producing uniform coatings on length scales approaching one meter, thus enabling scale-up for industrial applications. The rapidity, scalability, and thickness control at the nanometer scale afforded by this process makes it particularly interesting as a candidate for future encapsulation efforts on flexible electronic devices.
Methods
Materials

Perovskite precursors. 
Methylammonium iodide (MAI, Dyesol) and lead acetate trihydrate (PbAc2, Sigma-Aldrich CAS no. 6080-56-4) were prepared in a 40 wt% solution with a 3:1 molar ratio in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, Acros) with hypophosphorous acid (HPA, Sigma-Aldrich CAS no. 6303-21-5) added to the solution in a molar ratio of 0.0075:1 HPA:PbAc2.


Charge transport precursors. 
Compact titania (TiO2) was prepared from 0.254 M titanium isopropoxide (Sigma Aldrich, CAS no. 546-68-9) and 0.02 M HCl in ethanol (Acros). C60 (MER Corporation) was used as received. Poly(triarylamine) (PTAA, Solaris Chem.) was prepared in toluene (Acros) at a concentration of 15 mg mL−1 with the addition of 10 μL Li-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) in acetonitrile (170 mg mL−1) and 6 μL distilled tert-butylpyridine (tBP) as dopants to enhance conductivity and film formation and the addition of 0.2 wt equivalent 1,3,5,7-tetrakis-(p-benzylazide)-adamantane (TPBA)—synthesized as reported elsewhere38—to generate a cross-linked film after 10 min exposure to UV-C light in N2.


Barrier film precursors. 
Hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO) and α,α,α-trifluorotoluene (TFT) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification (≥98.5% and ≥99% anhydrous, respectively).

Device fabrication
ITO-glass (Xin-Yan Technology) with a sheet resistance of 10 Ω □−1 and dimensions of 2 cm × 2 cm were used as substrates. The substrates were cleaned by sequential sonication in a 1:10 Extran:DI water solution, DI water, acetone, and IPA for 15 min periods. All solutions were filtered through a 0.2 μm PTFE filter immediately prior to deposition. The TiO2 precursor solution was spin-coated in ambient at 2000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 150 °C for 1 h. C60 was thermally evaporated to a thickness of 15 nm to reduce hysteresis and fill any pinholes/voids in the amorphous nanoparticle TiO2 layer. The perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated in dry air at 2000 rpm for 1 min while drying with 20 psi air flow and subsequently annealed at 100 °C for 5 min. The PTAA solution was spin-coated in dry air at 4000 rpm for 45 s, then annealed at 75 °C for 5 min. The PTAA was cross-linked in a dry N2 glovebox by irradiation with UV-C light (λ = 254 nm) for 10 min. Finally, the 100 nm thick Au electrodes were thermally evaporated through a shadow mask.
Spray-plasma deposition
Dense organosilicate barrier films were deposited by RSPP. The atmospheric pressure plasma jet system (PlasmaTreat GmbH, Hayward, CA, USA) used in this study was based on the blown-arc discharge configuration, in which an arc was produced between two coaxial electrodes and blown out of a nozzle by the main process gas flow (air) at a flow rate of 35 standard liters per min (slm). The high-voltage electrode was driven by a DC power supply at an excitation frequency of 21 kHz. The resulting arc current was measured to be equal to 18.0 A. The precursor solution was sprayed onto the devices in lab air, using an ultrasonic atomizing nozzle (AccuMist, Sono-Tek Corporation) operating at 1 W with an atomizing gas pressure of 2 psi (nitrogen) and fed by a syringe pump delivering 500 μL min−1. The ultrasonic nozzle was tilted at a ∼45° angle to spray the solution at the leading edge of the plasma post-discharge. The substrates were placed at a distance of 2.0 cm from the plasma nozzle. The spray nozzle-to-substrate distance and the plasma nozzle-to-spray nozzle distance were kept constant at a distance of 2.0 cm and 3.0 cm, respectively. The raster speed of the nozzles was kept constant at 200 mm s−1 with a lateral spacing of 0.25 cm. The spray-plasma configuration is illustrated schematically in Fig. 1. The overall procedure was carried out in an open-air enclosure at ca. 25 °C and 40% RH.
Precursor solutions were mixed in a dry N2 glovebox and transferred to a syringe for ambient deposition.
Characterization methods

XPS. 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) surface surveys were performed on a PHI Versaprobe III Scanning XPS Microprobe (Physical Electronics Inc.) with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1486 eV). Depth profiling was performed with an Ar+ ion gun to etch the sample surface with an accelerating voltage of 3 kV and beam current of 3 μA over a 2 mm × 2 mm area.


SEM. 
Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) was performed on an FEI Magellan 400 XHR FE-SEM with an accelerating voltage of 1 kV, a current beam of 6.3 pA and a working distance of 2 cm for cross-sectional micrographs, and with an accelerating voltage of 10 kV, a current beam of 25 pA and a working distance of 4 cm for top-view micrographs.


Profilometry. 
The thickness of barrier films for 5, 10, 15, and 20 cycles with OBT0–OBT75 was measured by depositing on PTAA/ITO substrates and measuring the step height using a Bruker Dektak XT profilometer with a stylus force of 5 mg.


Contact angle measurements. 
The water contact angle (WCA) of the films and the photographs of the droplets were obtained using a Krüss Drop Shape Analyzer – DSA100 contact angle meter. The size of the de-ionized water drop used for the measurements was 2 μL. The WCA measurements were consistent across the whole coated substrate.


UV-vis absorption. 
Absorption spectra of the OBT films deposited on PTAA/ITO-glass substrates were collected over a range from 300 to 800 nm with a 1 nm resolution using a Cary 6000i spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies Inc., USA) with an integrating sphere, calibrated with a blank substrate (PTAA/ITO-glass) and a dark baseline.


Conductivity of plasma exposed PTAA. 
PTAA film sheet resistances were measured on glass substrates before and after plasma exposure using a four point probe setup (Jandel) connected to a Keithley model 2450 digital source meter.


Stability testing. 
Samples were aged in an environmental chamber under dry heat (85 °C, 25% RH) or damp heat (85 °C, 85% RH) conditions, and J–V curves were periodically measured to track the changes in device efficiency with time.

J–V measurements were performed using a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter and a 300 W xenon lamp (Oriel) solar simulator for irradiation. The lamp was calibrated with an NREL-calibrated KG5 filtered Si reference cell. J–V curves were taken from forward to reverse bias and sampled at 0.05 V intervals with a 0.5 s delay time at each voltage step before taking data. Cells were masked to expose a 0.12 cm2 window.


Mass spectrometry: methylammonium egress. 
Barrier protected and control devices were placed on a hot plate at 85 °C, 40% RH. An optical microscope was used to both illuminate the device and periodically examine the sample surface. Methylammonium egress from aging devices was monitored with in situ gas phase mass spectrometry (GP-MS). A Hiden Analytical HPR-20 transient mass spectrometer outfitted with an EPIC MS analyzer was used to track m/z = 31 over the course of the aging. A heated capillary (d = 1.0 mm) was placed 1.0 mm above the sample surface, 45° from normal. The capillary was differentially pumped down to 5 × 10−7 Torr and sampled methylammonium vapor. The ionization energy and emitter current were set to 70 eV and 500 μA respectively.


X-ray diffraction. 
Samples with an ITO-glass/MAPbI3/PTAA/OBT0–50 architecture were prepared for measurement by wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) at beam line 11-3 of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL). Two-dimensional scattering was collected with monochromatic 12.7 keV X-rays and recorded on a Rayonix Mx-225 detector at a detector distance of 250 mm with an incident angle of 2.5°. Aging was performed on a heated stage held at 150 °C, 165 °C, or 180 °C in a chamber purged with He to reduce beam damage. Images were calibrated using LaB6. Integration of MAPbI3 and PbI2 peaks was performed in python code built onto GSAS-II.39
The formation of PbI2 from MAPbI3 was assumed to follow zero-order kinetics, typical of decomposition reactions. The activation energy, , was calculated from the reaction rate: (1) (2)where KPbI2 is the rate of PbI2 formation and kB is the Boltzmann constant.


Mechanical bending setup. 
Flexibility testing was performed by depositing barriers films on top of PTAA coated polyimide substrates (127 μm thick, McMaster Carr) using a tensile testing system (Delaminator DTS, Menlo Park, CA). Samples were affixed to grips with cyanoacrylate and secured between the load cell and actuator with metal pins. The samples were cyclically loaded at a displacement rate of 500 μm s−1 and held for a delay of 1 s at the start and end points of each cycle. Imaging was periodically performed with an optical microscope (Keyence). The bending radius, R, was calculated using eqn (3) under the assumption that the deflected substrate formed a circular arc: (3)where c was the chord length and d was the vertical displacement of the substrate.


Adhesion testing. 
Double cantilever beam (DCB) specimens were made on 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS)-treated glass substrates. APTMS was used following a literature method40 to ensure the PTAA adhered to the substrate. The PTAA layer was spin-coated, followed by OBT0, OBT25, or OBT50 films deposited in an identical manner to devices. A metal film (5 nm Ti/200 nm Ag) was then e-beam evaporated before bonding an identical glass substrate with a brittle epoxy (E-20 NS, Hysol). A razor blade was used to remove excess epoxy from the specimen edges after curing overnight at room temperature.
DCB specimens were loaded under displacement control in a thin-film adhesion testing system (Delaminator DTS, Menlo Park, CA) from which a load, P, versus displacement, Δ, curve was recorded. The adhesion energy, Gc (J m−2), was measured in terms of the critical value of the applied strain energy release rate, G. Gc can be expressed in terms of the critical load, Pc, at which crack growth occurs, the crack length, a, the plane-strain elastic modulus, E′, of the substrates and the specimen dimensions: width, B and half-thickness, h. Gc was calculated from eqn (4):41 (4)
An estimate of the crack length was experimentally determined from a measurement of the elastic compliance, dΔ/dP, using the compliance relationship in eqn (5): (5)
All Gc testing was carried out in laboratory air environment at ∼25 °C and ∼40% RH.

 	Fig. 1  The barrier deposition method used in this paper was a variation of rapid spray plasma processing (RSPP) in which the barrier precursors, HMDSO and TFT were mixed and sprayed at the leading edge of a compressed air plasma. This spray and plasma were swept over the entire device to create submicron barrier films.

The uncoated device degraded to 50% of its initial efficiency within 150 h and 10% after 3176 h, while the OBT25 device retained 92% of its original efficiency after 3176 h. Insets: photographs of the front of the devices and the back side of the pixels after device exposure for only 1000 h.	 

 	Fig. 5  1D XRD scans of perovskite samples before and after in situ exposure to 180 °C for (a) no barrier film (control), (b) OBT25, and (c) OBT50 as well as 2D XRD scans after exposure for (d) control for 30 min, (e) OBT25 for 60 min, and (f) OBT50 for 60 min, where the control has entirely degraded to PbI2 and the barrier film samples are largely unchanged. This change in integrated peak intensity from the XRD scans is quantified and plotted for control, OBT25, and OBT50 while heated at 150 °C, 165 °C, and 180 °C showing (g) the PbI2 growth rate and (h) the (100) cubic MAPbI3 degradation rate as a function of time extracted from 2D data. (i) Effective activation energy, , for the degradation of MAPbI3 into PbI2, where a higher value of  suggests better thermal stability.
