    , Accepted 26th November 2015First published on 27th November 2015AbstractWe have designed a new set of D–π–A type organic dye sensitizers with different acceptor and anchoring groups, and systematically investigated their optoelectronic properties for efficient dye sensitized solar cell applications. Particularly, we have focused on the effects of anchoring groups on the dye aggregation phenomenon. TDDFT results indicate that the dyes with CSSH anchoring groups exhibit improved optoelectronic properties compared to other dyes. Further, molecular dynamics simulations have been performed to describe the formation of dye aggregation due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The observed results indicate that dyes with CSSH anchoring groups are less prone to aggregate because of their very weak intermolecular interactions.
1. Introduction
Over the last two decades, dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted considerable research attention among renewable energy sources because of their low cost and high conversion efficiency.1–3 The dye sensitizer is the most important component in DSSCs, which is not only used to absorb light but it also helps to inject the electrons into the semiconductor surface. Recently, metal-free organic dyes have been proposed, instead of organometallic dyes, due to their high molar extinction coefficients, flexibility of their molecular design, low cost device fabrication and environmental friendliness.4–7 A typical organic dye consists of an electron donor, π-conjugated spacer, and an acceptor with anchoring groups.
Even though a lot of efforts have been made in the design strategies of organic dyes to enhance the efficiency of DSSCs, one can reach up to only 12%. These strategies include the substitution of different donor/acceptor moieties and by means of increasing π-spacers or changing anchoring groups. The overall DSSC performances are determined by some key factors such as the excited state redox potential of the dyes, electronic coupling between the LUMO and the semiconductor conduction band and more importantly the formation of dye aggregation. Most of the above issues have been solved by means of substituting different functional groups and their performances are reported in the literature except for dye aggregation. In organic dyes, aggregation occurs when it adsorbs onto the semiconductor surface, which lowers the conversion efficiency.8–12
The electrostatic and non-covalent interactions of the organic dyes with the surface or within adjacent dye molecules cause dye aggregation. Previous studies show that aggregation can be controlled either by means of substituting bulky groups or by bridging of two chromophores into a spiral configuration.13–15 Also, some anti-aggregating agents have been used to avoid the formation of aggregation, which improves the electron transport and thereby increases the power conversion efficiency of DSSCs.16–18 All of these studies, and others which have previously reported the design of efficient sensitizers for DSSCs, used either carboxylic acid or cyanoacrylic acid as an anchoring group, which may increase dye aggregation.4,5,19 The anchoring group plays an important role not only in the electron injection part but also in governing dye aggregation. However, the effect of anchoring groups on dye aggregation have been much less investigated. In recent years, theoretical studies have been used to investigate the different atomic structures and certain dynamics processes of dye aggregation, which cannot be easily observed experimentally. Feng et al.20 reported the aggregation effects on optoelectronic properties of organic dyes. Hitoshi et al.21 investigated the aggregation of black dyes via intermolecular hydrogen bonding using DFT methods. In the present study, we designed D–π–A structured organic dyes with a new set of anchoring groups such as PO3H2, SO3H and CSSH. Furthermore, the substituent effect of a cyano group (CN) with these anchoring groups on the aggregation and absorption properties has been investigated. Herein we focus on the formation of dimers via intermolecular hydrogen bonds in the designed dyes using MD simulations.
2. Computational details
The geometries of the designed dyes with different acceptor and anchoring groups were optimized using both the B3LYP22 and ωB97XD23–26 hybrid exchange correlation functionals together with a standard 6-31G* basis set.27 Further, frequency calculations have been performed at the same level of theory to verify the nature of the saddle point. The accuracy of the different DFT functionals (such as B3LYP, ωB97XD, BHandHLYP28 M062X,25 and CAM-B3LYP26) for the spectral properties have been explored by performing benchmark calculations for some of the organic dyes (L1 and L2),29 which are similar to our designed dyes, in an acetonitrile environment and the calculated absorption energies are summarized in Table S1 of the ESI.† In order to include the solvent effects in the benchmark calculations, conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM) method was used.30,31 As can be seen from Table S1 (ESI†), the ωB97XD method gives the absorption energies closest to the experimental values for the referenced dyes. Recent previous studies32,33 also confirm the accuracy of this method in predicting vertical excitation energies. Hence, we considered the long range corrected ωB97XD method to calculate the lowest 8 singlet transitions for all of our designed dyes. Further, the calculated absorption energies were transformed into spectra in the SWizard program,34,35 using the Gaussian model with half-bandwidths of 3000 cm−1. All of the above calculations were performed using the Gaussian09 package.36
2.1. MD simulation details
Molecular dynamics simulations were performed using FORCITE Module, which is commercially available in the Materials Studio v7 package,37 with the Condensed-Phase Optimized Molecular Potential for Atomistic simulation studies (COMPASS) force field.38–40 A 37.02 Å and 36.19 Å cubic simulation box with periodic boundary conditions in all directions was constructed with a density of 1 g cm−3 for dyes with COOH and CSSH anchoring groups, respectively. The systems were minimized using a smart algorithm with 5000 integration steps. To equilibrate the systems, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out under canonical ensemble (NVT) at a constant temperature of 298 K maintained using an Andersen thermostat. The equations of motion were integrated with the velocity Verlet algorithm for a total simulation time of 2 ns with a time step of 1 fs. The systems were equilibrated further by performing annealing for 5 cycles using the anneal task in the FORCITE module. In this process, the temperature was increased from 300 K to 500 K with 5 heating ramps per cycle. A production run of 500 ps was carried out under isothermal–isobaric (NPT) conditions, with pressure and temperature held at 1 atm and 300 K, respectively, by employing a Nose thermostat and Berendsen barostat. During the simulations, the non-bonded energies were calculated using the popular Ewald summation while the COMPASS force field was used to calculate both van der Waals and electrostatic interactions.
3. Results and discussion
The organic dyes based on D–π–A configuration considered in this study are shown in Fig. 1. Here, we considered 4-methoxy-N-(4-methoxyphenyl)-N-phenylbenzeneamine (MPBA) as the donor, thiophene (T) as the π-bridge, three acceptors, such as dicyanomethylidene-cyclopentadithiophene (CDM), cyclopentadithiophene (CDT), and thienopyrazine (TP), and four anchoring groups such as COOH, CSSH, PO3H2, and SO3H, and all of these molecular structures are shown in Fig. 1. From our previous study, the strength of the considered acceptors is as follows; CDM > TP > CDT.5 The basic D–π–A configuration has been constructed using the above moieties and optimized using both B3LYP and ωB97XD methods with the 6-31G* basis set. Also, the effects of a cyano group in the anchoring part have been studied.

3.1. Optoelectronic properties
The UV/vis spectra of these designed sensitizers were simulated in the gas phase using the ωB97XD/6-31G* level of theory based on the ground state optimized structures at the same level of theory. The simulated UV/vis spectra of these designed sensitizers are shown in Fig. 2 and the corresponding features for the main peak of the spectra of dyes with COOH and CSSH anchoring groups are summarized in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. The spectral data of dyes with other anchoring groups calculated at the ωB97XD/6-31G* level of theory are given in Tables S2 and S3 of the ESI.†

It has been observed from Fig. 2, that the simulated spectra of the designed sensitizers with CDM acceptor groups possess dual band absorption peaks; one in the shorter wavelength region (∼345–410 nm) and another one in the longer wavelength region (∼630–660 nm), whereas, mono band absorption is observed in the case of sensitizers with CDT and TP acceptor groups. This result confirms our earlier conclusion that the strength of the acceptor influences the UV/vis spectra.5 Also, we compared the effect of different anchoring groups on the absorption spectra. From Fig. 2a–c, it has been observed that the simulated absorption spectra of the sensitizers with COOH, PO3H2, and SO3H anchoring groups are almost similar, whereas, the sensitizers with a CSSH anchoring group (Fig. 2d) possess absorption peaks at longer wavelength regions. Further, to understand the effect of substitution of the cyano group in the anchoring part, we calculated the absorption properties of the designed dyes with a cyano group and the simulated spectra are also included in Fig. 2. We found that the inclusion of the cyano group makes the absorption spectra red shifted in the shorter wavelength regions and it slightly increased the intensity of the spectra of all of the designed dyes, in accordance with our previous studies.5,19
3.2. Frontier molecular orbitals
To understand further, we plotted molecular orbital (MO) diagrams which determine the charge separated states of the designed dyes and are shown in Fig. 3 for dyes with COOH and CSSH anchoring groups, and for other systems are given in Fig. S1–S3 of the ESI.† It is well known that, for an efficient dye, the HOMO must be localized on the donor part and the LUMO on the acceptor and anchoring groups.5,41 From this plot, we observed that the LUMO of the dyes with the strongest acceptor (CDM) localized mainly on the acceptor moiety not on the anchoring groups, hence the electron injection efficiency from the anchoring group to the semiconductor surface will be less even though it has an absorption band in the visible region. This may be due to the strongest electron accepting ability of CDM, hence it will trap all of the excited electrons. Whereas, the LUMO of TP and CDT acceptor groups localized both on the acceptor and anchoring groups which will have more electron injection ability. The calculated molecular orbital compositions of the designed dyes with CSSH and COOH anchoring groups are summarized in Table 3, which shows that the HOMOs are mainly contributed by the donor and π-bridge subunits and the LUMOs are either from acceptor or anchoring groups. Our previous study revealed that contributions from anchoring groups for LUMOs are significant to inject the electrons into the semiconductor surface.41 From Fig. S2 and S3 (ESI†), we can see that the LUMOs of the dyes with PO3H2 and SO3H2 anchoring groups delocalized only on the acceptor part and hence, it will not inject the electrons into the semiconductor surface efficiently. Further, from Table 3, we found that our designed dyes with CSSH anchoring groups contributed to the LUMOs significantly more than the COOH anchoring groups. The contribution of COOH anchoring groups to the LUMOs is only 10% whereas the CSSH anchoring group contribution is ∼50%. Therefore, we expect that dyes with CSSH anchoring groups will have a strong electronic coupling with the semiconductor surface, and can more easily inject the excited electrons into the surface than dyes with COOH groups. Based on the above results, we considered only dyes with CSSH and COOH anchoring groups for further calculations.

Fig. 4 shows the calculated energy levels of the designed dyes with different acceptor and anchoring groups (CSSH and COOH). As the strength of the acceptor group decreases, the HOMO–LUMO gap increases. It has been observed that the LUMO level is downshifted with an increase in the strength of the acceptor, whereas the HOMO level does not change much since the HOMO is mainly localized on the donor and π-bridge part. The calculated HOMO–LUMO gaps for the dyes with a CSSH anchoring group are lower those with a COOH group, which is responsible for the redshift in the UV/vis absorption spectra of the dyes with CSSH anchoring groups. Also, the substitution of a cyano group into the anchoring group decreases the HOMO–LUMO gap value further in the designed dyes. Based on the previous studies,41–43 we expect that the sensitizers with the smallest HOMO–LUMO energy gap values will show a higher efficiency and hence the designed dyes with CSSH anchoring groups may exhibit a better performance than the others.

3.3. Dye aggregation
Dye aggregation is a well-known concern for DSSCs since it leads to a reduced electron injection yield and thereby affects the overall conversion efficiency.20,44 Previously many studies reported that the spectral properties of dyes affects when they form a dimer due to the intermolecular interactions.45,46 Generally, dye aggregation is classified into two types; J-type which causes a redshift and H-type aggregation which leads to a blue shift in the UV/vis spectrum.47,48 These two kinds (J or H) of aggregation are formed when the dye molecules are stacked side-by-side or face-to-face, respectively. For instance, H-type is formed via intermolecular hydrogen bonds between anchoring groups (usually –COOH groups), when it forms a dimer or trimer. Keeping this in mind, here we investigate the possibility of dimer formations for the designed dyes with different anchoring groups for both face-to-face and side-by-side configurations. For this, we considered six dimer structures of the designed dyes consisting of three different acceptor groups (CDM, TP and CDT) and two anchoring groups (COOH and CSSH). In the face-to-face case, we considered two types such as head-to-head and head-to-tail types of dimers. The designed dimers both side-by-side and face-to-face are optimized using both the B3LYP and ωB97XD functionals using the 6-31G* basis set, and the optimized dimer structures for the side-by-side and face-to-face configurations are shown in Fig. 5–7.

 Fig. 7  Optimized dimer geometries of the designed dyes in face-to-face (head-to-tail) configurations. (Atoms with white, gray, blue, red, and yellow represent H, C, N, O, and S, respectively.) 
The intermolecular interaction energies (ΔEint) were calculated as the energy difference between the isolated monomer and the dimer. We used the counterpoise (CP)49,50 method to eliminate the basis set superposition error (BSSE) in the calculation of interaction energies. The calculated hydrogen bond distances and BSSE corrected interaction energies for both face-to-face and side-by-side dimers at ωB97XD/6-31G* are given in Tables 4 and 5, respectively. Previously, Malenov, et al.,51,52 found that interaction energies for the stacked model systems calculated using the local correlated hybrid GGA with the D2 dispersion correction ωB97XD method agree well with the CCSD(T)/CBS energies. From Tables 4 and 5, it can be seen that, the face-to-face dimers are more stable than the side-by-side dimers. Further, from Table 5, we observed a relatively weak interaction between the dimers containing CSSH anchoring groups, as supported by a relatively lower interaction energy than the COOH group and this is consistent with the intermolecular distances. The calculated average S⋯H bond distances (∼2.57 Å) are longer than the O⋯H distances (1.67 Å), which leads to the smaller interaction energies for the dyes with CSSH anchoring groups compared to the COOH group dimers. The accuracy of this method in predicting the hydrogen bond strengths is confirmed in recent study by Buytendyk et al.53 Previously, Wenger et al.54 reported that hydrogen bonding increases dye aggregation and recently, Dell'Orto and co-workers55 confirmed in their study on N719 dye that the aggregation mainly arises through the intermolecular hydrogen bonding. It has been observed that the calculated S⋯H bond distances are slightly smaller than the net van der Walls radii of the binding atoms (2.70 Å),56 indicating very weak intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Therefore, we expect that the designed dyes with CSSH anchoring groups may overturn the dye aggregation compared to the COOH group because of its weak intermolecular hydrogen bonding.

Further, in order to check the possibility of dimer formation for the designed dyes, we calculated the change in Gibbs free energy using ΔG = GAB − (GA + GB), where GAB, GA and GB are the Gibbs free energies of the dimer and monomers A and B, respectively. We also included the BSSE correction for the calculation of ΔG and the calculated values of ΔG are given in Tables 4 and 5. It has been observed that the calculated ΔG values for all of the designed dyes of face-to-face type dimers and the dyes containing COOH dimers in the side-by side configuration are negative (ΔG < 0), which indicate the possibility of these interactions/reactions can occur at higher temperatures. Whereas, the change in Gibbs free energies for the dimers of dyes with CSSH anchoring groups in side-by-side configurations are positive, which reveals that even at higher temperatures, the possibility of dimer formation for these dyes is comparatively less than the others. The above results show that dye aggregation due to the formation of dye dimers via intermolecular interactions is less in the dyes with CSSH anchoring groups.
Furthermore, recent studies by Feng et al.,20,57 confirm that the structure of the dye in dimers also limits the absorption spectra and hence we also investigated the dimeric configurations by analyzing the dihedral angles between the different units in the dimer structures and that of the monomers. A schematic representation of the selected dihedral angles is shown in Fig. 8 and the calculated dihedral angle values are given in Table S4 of the ESI.† We noticed that the variation of these dihedral angles from the monomer to dimer is very low in the case of dyes with CSSH anchoring groups compared to those with COOH anchoring groups, which indicates that the dimers of dyes with CSSH groups have a more planar structure than those with COOH, which suppresses the dye aggregation. The above results agree with the optimized dimeric structures of the designed dyes. As can be seen from Fig. 6, the distance between two CSSH groups is relatively large, compared with the distance between the COOH groups, which can avoid intermolecular interactions. We also calculated the hydrogen bond distances between the individual monomers in the head-to-head dimeric configuration of the designed dyes and the values are given in Table S5 of the ESI.† We found that, either one of the considered hydrogen bond distances in the dyes with COOH anchoring groups is in the range of ∼2 Å, which indicates that there is a hydrogen bond formation between the monomer dyes. Whereas, all the hydrogen bond distances are comparatively longer (∼3–6 Å) in the dimers with CSSH anchoring groups, which supports the earlier results that possibility of dye aggregation in CSSH anchoring group dyes is less than the others.

To gain insights into the possible aggregation of the designed dyes due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding (O⋯H and S⋯H), the radial distribution functions (RDFs) between the dye monomers are calculated from the MD simulations. The RDF can provide an approximate estimation of the interaction of dye molecules at a particular distance. The calculated RDF for the interactions between O & H atoms and S & H atoms are shown in Fig. 9. Fig. 9a illustrates that the first peak of the RDF for O⋯H and S⋯H interactions at an average time of 500 ps is located at around 1.75 and 2.25 Å, respectively, which indicates that the S⋯H interaction is significantly weaker than the O⋯H interactions. From Fig. 9b, it has been observed that, the position of the peak and its trend does not change with time evolution, but the amplitude decreased significantly. Whereas in Fig. 9a, even at a time of 2000 ps, there is a large amplitude peak located around 4 Å. These results clearly indicate that, even after 2000 ps the dyes with COOH anchoring groups are interacting with each other, which can increase dye aggregation. On the other hand, after certain a period of time, the dyes with CSSH anchoring groups tend to keep away from each other and hence the intermolecular distance increases between those dyes. Therefore, we may expect that the designed dyes containing CSSH anchoring groups can bind more strongly with the semiconductor surface than the other dyes and it can inject excited electrons efficiently due to a lower aggregation effect. From the above results we found that the dye aggregation can be suppressed not only by means of adding additives but also by changing the appropriate anchoring groups while designing efficient sensitizers for DSSC applications.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have designed organic dyes with different acceptor and anchoring groups and studied their optoelectronic properties using DFT and TDDFT methods. Our calculated results indicate that the dyes with CSSH anchoring groups have improved spectral properties such as a considerable redshift with an increase in intensity in the absorption spectra compared to the dyes with other anchoring groups. We also confirm that the inclusion of a cyano group into the anchoring part enhances the absorption spectra of the designed sensitizers. We have also demonstrated the formation of dye dimers through intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions by MD simulations. We found that the intermolecular hydrogen bonds in the dyes with CSSH anchoring groups are much weaker than in the COOH dyes, which indicates that aggregation due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding was minimized in those dyes. We found that the dye aggregation can be suppressed not only by means of adding additives but also by changing the anchoring part of the dyes. This theoretical work could give an idea for suppressing the dye aggregation while designing efficient sensitizers for the practical application of DSSCs.
