1. Introduction
Energy shortage and environmental pollution are two major challenges that currently threaten the survival of mankind. Therefore, renewable and clean energy must be developed to substitute fossil fuels.1–6 Wind, solar, and tidal power are good choices for clean energy; however, they are usually restricted by the uncertainty of natural conditions and intermittence. Electrochemical energy storage devices, which can store electricity from these sources, can solve this problem effectively.7–14 Among numerous electrochemical storage systems, emerging rechargeable batteries, such as lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries, lithium–selenium (Li–Se) batteries, lithium–oxygen (Li–O2) batteries, and zinc–air (Zn–air) batteries, have drawn attention due to their respective features.3,15–24 However, the current performance of the above-mentioned rechargeable battery systems cannot satisfy the demands of rapidly developed societies. The microstructures of electrode materials are critical to the performance of batteries.25–27 Nanostructured materials have been extensively studied as electrode materials of rechargeable batteries because they can facilitate the transport of electrolytes, shorten the diffusion path of metal ions in the solid-state phase, and accommodate volume changes during charging/discharging.28–32 Therefore, exploring new approaches to prepare nanostructured electrode materials has become the main focus in the field of rechargeable batteries.4,33,34
In recent years, coordination compound-derived materials, which are prepared via appropriate treatment of coordination compounds (mainly including metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and Prussian blue (PB)), have attracted attention in the field of nanomaterials.35–40 During the preparation of the above-mentioned derivatives, coordination compounds act as the precursor and template.41,42 In general, the obtained coordination compound-derived materials can be mainly classified into several types: transition metal oxides (TMOs), TMOs/carbon composites, transition metal sulfides (TMSs)/carbon composites, transition metal phosphides (TMPs)/carbon composites, non-TM oxides/carbon composites, and carbon materials. Specifically, these materials possess several characteristics: (1) all of these materials have porous structures due to several reasons, including the gas release during heat treatment, the intrinsic porous structure of MOFs, macropores from the breakage of the framework of MOFs, the connection of adjacent small pores, and so on. (2) For coordination compound-derived carbon-based composites, the carbon obtained from organic ligands can be well distributed to form the carbon matrix. Moreover, the obtained carbon in this system generally possesses a high degree of graphitization due to the catalytic effect of the transition metal during the heat treatment. (3) Coordination compound precursors usually possess uniform nanostructures, such as nanospheres, nanopolyhedra, and nanorods. Thus, hierarchical nanostructured coordination compound-derived materials can be easily obtained. (4) Mixed metal oxides are easily obtained by adjusting the components of coordination compounds. For the aforementioned characteristics, coordination compound-derived materials have been extensively studied as electrode materials of various rechargeable batteries.
In this review, we summarize the recent advances regarding coordination compound-derived materials as electrode materials in rechargeable batteries. We systematically introduce and analyze the synthesis, morphologies, and electrochemical performance of these materials. Moreover, some relative perspectives and outlooks about these materials are proposed.
2. Applications of MOF derivatives in rechargeable batteries
MOFs are a class of inorganic–organic hybrid metal coordination compound materials formed by linking inorganic and organic units through covalent coordination linkages.36,43 According to the different organic linkers and metal ions, various MOFs have been prepared, such as MOF-5, MOF-74, ZIF-8, ZIF-67, HKUST-1, MIL-88, and MIL-101.44 MOFs can be utilized as precursors to fabricate MOF derivatives.30 MOF derivatives have been applied in various rechargeable batteries, such as LIBs, SIBs, Li–S batteries, Li–Se batteries, Li–O2 batteries, and Zn–air batteries.36,40,45
2.1 MOF derivatives for LIBs
LIBs have been widely applied to many electronic fields due to their high energy density and long cycling life.46,47 However, the pursuit of electrode materials with excellent electrochemical performance is still critical to the further development of LIBs.48 MOF-derived materials have attracted enormous attention as electrode materials because of their porosity and tunable structure.36,49 Various derivative materials with designed morphologies can be obtained by utilizing different MOFs as precursors and templates.

2.1.1 Metal oxides. 
Metal oxides derived from MOFs can largely maintain the intrinsic morphology of MOFs and can thus possess the structural advantages of MOFs.50,51 Coordination compound-derived TMOs have received extensive attention in LIBs. As electrode materials of LIBs, according to their reaction mechanism, they can be mainly classified into two types: conversion reaction and intercalation/deintercalation reaction. TMOs based on the conversion reaction mechanism (MxOy + 2yLi+ + 2ye− ↔ yLi2O + xM), such as Fe2O3, Co3O4, and NiO, usually possess high theoretical specific capacities.11 TMOs based on the intercalation/deintercalation reaction mechanism (MxOy + nLi+ + ne− ↔ LinMxOy), such as TiO2, can usually maintain good structural integrity without collapsing during the charge/discharge process, ensuring a long cycle life.11
Xu et al. synthesized spindle-like porous α-Fe2O3 using an Fe-based MOF template (Fig. 1a).52 As shown in Fig. 1b, the sample consisted of clustered Fe2O3 nanoparticles and possessed a nanoporous structure. Owing to the unique nanostructure, the spindle-like porous α-Fe2O3 exhibited enhanced performance for Li storage. When utilized as an anode material of LIBs, a high specific capacity of 911 mA h g−1 was achieved at 0.2 C (1 C = 1000 mA g−1) after 50 cycles (Fig. 1c). The sample also delivered a comparable capacity of 424 mA h g−1 even at a high rate of 10 C. Furthermore, various Fe2O3 porous nanostructures, including spindle, concave octahedron, solid octahedron, and yolk–shell octahedron-in-octahedron, have been prepared controllably by Guo et al.53 Mesoporous yolk–shell octahedron-in-octahedron Fe2O3 exhibited a great Li-storage performance for LIBs. It could achieve a reversible specific capacity of 1176 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 200 cycles and good cycling performance (744 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 1 A g−1). Wang et al. used a Ti-MOF precursor (MIL-125) to prepare porous anatase TiO2 (Fig. 1d and e) and applied it in LIBs.54 The porous TiO2 sample showed a high BET surface area of 220 m2 g−1, which was mainly ascribed to the porous structure of MIL-125. This porous structure ensured a fast Li+ diffusion and acted as a buffer for volumetric expansion. The sample showed a good capacity (about 160 mA h g−1) at 5 C (1 C = 168 mA g−1) after 50 cycles (Fig. 1f). Notably, the sample also delivered good rate capability and capacity retention. A reversible capacity of 166 mA h g−1 was retained at 1 C after 500 cycles. Utilizing MOFs as a template can help in the design and manufacture of desirable structures. Pang and co-workers prepared a rod-like MOF derivative NiO via an effective strategy (Fig. 1g).55 The sample possessed a controllable mesoporous structure (Fig. 1h) and demonstrated good electrochemical properties. The mesoporous NiO nanorod achieved a high reversible capacity of 1019 mA h g−1 (larger than the theoretical capacity) at 100 mA g−1 after 100 cycles (Fig. 1i).

Hybrid composites of different metal oxides have also been manufactured using MOF templates.56 Huang et al. reported the preparation of NiFe2O4/Fe2O3 nanotubes through annealing an MOF precursor with a core–shell structure (Fig. 2a–d).57Fig. 2a shows the schematic for the synthesis of NiFe2O4/Fe2O3 nanotubes. This structure was a hierarchical hollow architecture constructed from nanosized primary particles (Fig. 2d). Owing to the synergetic effect of different components, the sample demonstrated an enhanced electrochemical performance. It delivered a high reversible specific capacity of 936.9 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 up to 100 cycles (Fig. 2f). Moreover, the sample could still deliver a capacity of 423.6 mA h g−1 even at 2000 mA g−1 (Fig. 2e). Sun and co-workers also designed a hollow dodecahedron NiCo2O4/NiO structure using a zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) template (Fig. 2g–j).58 The sample delivered a high reversible capacity of 1535 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1 over 100 cycles with a high capacity retention of 97.2% when applied as an anode material in LIBs (Fig. 2k). As shown in Fig. 2l, the sample also exhibited an excellent rate capability.

2.1.2 Carbon-based materials. 
MOFs are also utilized as precursors to manufacture carbon-based materials for application in LIBs. These carbon-based materials derived from MOFs demonstrate superior electrochemical properties in LIBs due to their high conductivity. Zheng et al. reported the preparation of highly nitrogen (N)-doped porous carbon (Fig. 3a) using an MOF precursor (ZIF-8).59 High N-doping of carbon materials is important for enhancing the electrochemical performance of LIBs. The sample demonstrated a high nitrogen content of 17.72 wt%, which was higher than those of most reported N-doped carbon materials. Notably, the sample was a porous carbon with partial graphitization, which could increase the conductivity. Furthermore, the unique structure possessed plenty of small graphene analogous particles, which provide abundant active sites for grafting N atoms. Accordingly, the lithium storage could be improved efficiently. The sample delivered an ultrahigh capacity of up to 2132 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 over 50 cycles when evaluated as an anode material for LIBs (Fig. 3c). A good rate capability was also obtained (Fig. 3b). Therefore, the as-prepared product achieved remarkable electrochemical performance.

Utilizing the MOF template strategy can help in the manufacture of multiple functional composites for high-performance LIBs. In addition to the work on simplex carbon materials, considerable investigations have focused on TMOs/carbon composites.60–63 Wang et al. reported the synthesis of rutile TiO2 embedded in carbon (TiO2/C) via the pyrolytic treatment of an MOF precursor.64 Yang et al. demonstrated a facile and scalable approach to synthesize hierarchically porous carbon-coated ZnO quantum dots (QDs) via a controlled pyrolysis of IRMOF-1 (Fig. 3d).65 As an electrode material of LIBs, ZnO is based on the following alloying–dealloying reaction: (1) ZnO + 2Li+ + 2e− → Zn + Li2O and (2) Zn + xLi+ + xe− ↔ LixZn (x ≤ 1).11 When evaluated as an anode material for LIBs, the sample (550N) exhibited a high specific charge capacity of about 1200 mA h g−1 at 75 mA g−1, good rate performance (∼400 mA h g−1 at 3750 mA g−1), and stable cyclability (with nearly 100% capacity retention from the 7th cycle to the 50th cycle) (Fig. 3e). Later on, MOF-derived ZnO@ZnO QDs/C with a core–shell structure was prepared by Zhang and co-workers using the in situ ion exchange strategy.66 This structure could shorten the diffusion distance for Li+ and enable sufficient conductivity. As a result, the sample displayed a good rate performance (with capacities of 1055, 913, 762, 591, and 530 mA h g−1 at 100, 200, 400, 800, and 1000 mA g−1, respectively). Recently, Zhao et al. synthesized multiple hybrid composites of ZnO/Ni3ZnC0.7/C spheres through the MOF template method.67Fig. 3f shows the formation process of solid and yolk–shell structured ZnO/Ni3ZnC0.7/C. By controlling the reaction time, they obtained the desirable yolk–shell structure (Fig. 3g–i). A high reversible capacity of 1002 mA h g−1 could be retained at 500 mA g−1 even after 750 cycles (Fig. 3j). Zou et al. fabricated porous ZnO/ZnFe2O4/C octahedra derived from an MOF precursor.68 This nanostructure was a hierarchical hollow structure composed of ultrafine building blocks. Thus, this material possessed a conductive elastic buffering framework and high porosity. It could deliver a relatively high capacity of 988 mA h g−1 even at 2 A g−1 after 100 cycles. Furthermore, Zhu's group synthesized a hierarchical composite of NiO/Ni covered with a graphene shell (NiO/Ni/graphene) by successive carbonization and oxidation treatments of Ni-MOFs.69 The sample possessed a large reversible capacity of 1144 mA h g−1, excellent rate performance (805 mA h g−1 at 15 A g−1), and great cyclability.
To further enhance the electrochemical performance of MOF-derived TMO materials, TMO@N-doped carbon composites have been fabricated. Zheng et al. prepared a nanocomposite of ultrasmall Fe2O3 nanoparticles embedded in N-doped hollow carbon sphere shells (Fe2O3@N-C) through the heat-treatment of an Fe-ZIF (Fig. 4a–c).70 As an anode material of LIBs, the Fe2O3@N-C sample could achieve a high initial discharge capacity of 1696 mA h g−1 (Fig. 4d) and maintain a discharge capacity of 1573 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at 0.1 C (1 C = 1000 mA g−1) (Fig. 4e). Even under 1 C, it could still exhibit a high stable reversible capacity of 1142 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. Wu et al. synthesized a nanocomposite of porous ZnFe2O4/carbon@N-doped carbon nanotubes (ZnFe2O4/C@NCNTs) via the pyrolysis of a Zn-Fe-ZIF (Fig. 4f and g).71 The porous ZnFe2O4/C@NCNT electrode delivered an ultrahigh initial discharge capacity of 2192 mA h g−1 and maintained a large specific capacity of 844 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1 (Fig. 4h). Even under 1 A g−1, the sample exhibited a specific capacity of 747 mA h g−1 (Fig. 4i). Recently, Ma et al. reported a facile self-template method to synthesize bi-component ZnO/ZnFe2O4/N-doped carbon (ZZFO-C) micro-polyhedra by using a bimetallic MOF as the precursor (ZnFe-ZIF) (Fig. 4j).72 The micro-polyhedra possessed a hierarchical hollow framework (Fig. 4k and l). When studied as LIB anodes, the ZZFO-C sample exhibited large reversible specific capacity (∼1000 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 200 mA g−1), good rate capability, and excellent cycling stability (Fig. 4m). A reversible capacity of 620 mA h g−1 was obtained after 1000 cycles at 2 A g−1 (Fig. 4m). The great performance of ZZFO-C could be attributed to its unique hierarchical hollow framework and the synergistic effect between the N-doped C matrix and the two active components.

Materials derived from MOFs containing polyoxometalate (POM) have also attracted interest for potential applications in LIBs. Xia et al. synthesized MoO2@C nano-octahedra by annealing an NENU-5 precursor, which contained Mo-based POM units, followed by Fe3+ etching (Fig. 5a).73 MoO2 was uniformly distributed in the porous carbon matrix (Fig. 5b–d). When used as an anode material, the MoO2@C composite could deliver a large discharge specific capacity of 1442 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 50 cycles and 443.8 mA h g−1 at 1000 mA g−1 after 850 cycles (Fig. 5e and f). The good performance might be ascribed to the unique porous carbon matrix.

2.2 MOF derivatives for SIBs
Owing to the abundant resources of sodium and being in the same alkali metal group as Li, SIBs have attracted extensive attention for electrochemical energy storage. Furthermore, SIBs possess a similar energy storage mechanism and electrochemical behavior to LIBs, thereby making them a promising alternative in the application of portable devices and electric vehicles.74–76
Nevertheless, the radius of Na+ is larger than that of Li+. As a result, the rapid intercalation/extraction of Na+ in host materials becomes difficult, resulting in inferior electrochemical performance.38,77 Therefore, rationally microstructured electrode materials must be designed for high-performance SIBs.6,78–80 The MOF template strategy is an efficient way to construct ideal nanostructures, such as nanoporous structures, polyhedral structures, and core–shell structures.15,75,81,82 Compounds derived from suitable MOFs exhibited improved electrochemical performance in SIBs. Ge et al. reported the preparation of core–shell CoP@C polyhedra (derived from ZIF-67) embedded in 3D reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and nickel foam (NF) (denoted as CoP@C-RGO-NF) (Fig. 6a–c).77 The unique CoP@C-RGO-NF can be used as a binder-free anode. The RGO-NF acted as an electrical conductor to interconnect the separated CoP@C polyhedra. The sample exhibited a specific capacity of 473.1 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 100 cycles (Fig. 6d) and delivered reversible capacities of 543.4, 405.3, and 253.6 mA h g−1 at current densities of 200, 400, and 800 mA g−1, respectively (Fig. 6e). TMSs have attracted enormous attention in further enhancing the specific capacity of electrode materials in SIBs.83–85 Zhou et al. fabricated MOF-derived CoS by in situ carbonization and sulfidation of a Co-MOF (Fig. 6f).86Fig. 6g shows that CoS nanoparticles with an average size of approximately 7 nm were uniformly embedded in porous carbon nanorods (denoted as 7-CoS/C). Owing to their favorable embedding structure, a long-term cycling stability was obtained (Fig. 6h). A capacity of 542 mA h g−1 was achieved after 2000 cycles at 1 A g−1 (a high capacity retention of 91.4%). Li et al. reported the design and fabrication of a nonocomposite of red phosphorus (P) and MOF-derived N-doped microporous carbon for use as an anode material of SIBs.87 The nanosized amorphous red P was confined within the MOF-derived carbon matrix, which not only could control the large volume expansion of red P but also could improve the electrical conductivity of the material. Thus, the sample displayed a great electrochemical performance. A reversible specific capacity of about 450 mA h g−1 could be obtained after 1000 cycles at a relatively high current density of 1 A g−1.

Li–S batteries are promising electrochemical storage devices due to their high energy density, low cost, and environmental friendliness.88–91 The reaction mechanism of Li–S batteries is described as 2Li+ + S + 2e− ↔ Li2S.19,92–94 Although Li–S batteries possess great potential in electrochemical energy storage technology, their practical applications are impeded by several issues, including the poor conductivity of sulfur and Li2S, a high volume expansion rate, and the shuttle effect.88,95,96 To suppress these problems, highly conductive host materials are required. Coordination compound-derived porous carbon-based materials can satisfy these requirements, because they not only can enhance the conductivity of electrode materials but also can buffer the volume expansion during the charge/discharge process. Meanwhile, coordination compound-derived materials are a class of porous materials that can suppress polysulfide loss in the electrolyte, thereby inhibiting the shuttle effect.97,98 Hierarchical nanoporous structures are a class of excellent materials to host sulfur. As early as 2013, Lou and his workers utilized unique MOF polyhedra as the template to prepare hierarchically microporous carbon polyhedra (MPCPs) as the sulfur support for Li–S batteries.99 The effects of the sulfur loading temperature and content have been comparatively investigated using an ideal sulfur loading microporous carbon model to enhance the electrochemical performance. The optimized MPCP/S composite could achieve a stable cycling performance when applied as the cathode material for Li–S batteries. Xu et al. also synthesized hierarchically porous carbon nanoplates derived from MOF-5 by a one-step simple pyrolysis process.100 The electrode demonstrated high capacity (initial/second discharge capacity = 1177/∼1000 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C) and good cycling performance (730 mA h g−1 at 0.5 C after 50 cycles) when encapsulated with sulfur as a cathode material for Li–S batteries. Furthermore, Dhawa et al. reported the preparation of an Mg/MgO-embedded mesoporous carbon composite derived from an Mg-MOF as the sulfur loading.101 A large reversible capacity of 1184 mA h g−1 could be achieved at 0.02 C.
Through a carbonizing treatment of Al-MOF with a 1D framework, Yang et al. successfully constructed a novel french fries-like hierarchically porous carbon (FLHPC) (Fig. 7a and b).102 Sulfur was infiltrated into the meso- and micropores of FLHPC (S/FLHPC) well. The S/FLHPC electrode not only delivered a large initial discharge specific capacity of approximately 1200 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C (1 C = 1672 mA h g−1) but also exhibited good cycling stability when applied as a cathode of Li–S batteries (Fig. 7c). When the rate was increased to 2 C, a large discharge specific capacity of 763 mA h g−1 was maintained after 20 cycles (Fig. 7d).

Compared with pristine hierarchical porous carbon, the MOF-derived N-doped ordered porous carbon exhibited better performance. Yang et al. designed and constructed a novel 3D bi-continuous hierarchical N-rich carbon structure (Fig. 7e–g) via the carbonization of a 3D ordered silica/ZIF-8 composite and a subsequent silica etching treatment.103 This material possesses a large specific surface area, hierarchical permeable micro-meso-macroporosity, and high N-doping species content (7.6 at%). When hosting a high content of sulfur up to 78 wt%, the sample achieved a high reversible capacity of 1160 mA h g−1 at 0.2 C and a great-rate capacity of 967 mA h g−1 at 2 C (Fig. 7h). A superior cycling stability could also be obtained with a reversible specific capacity of 534 mA h g−1 at 0.5 C after 1000 cycles (Fig. 7i). Recently, Li and co-workers utilized ZIF-8 as a precursor to prepare porous carbon.104 The sample exhibited improved electrochemical performance when employed as a host material for S in Li–S batteries. It delivered a capacity of nearly 800 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles, indicating good sulfur utilization.
RGO, which is a conductive material, is usually composited with coordination compound-derived materials to improve the electrochemical properties of electrode materials. Li et al. constructed RGO wrapped Co-doped porous carbon polyhedra (RGO/Co-C), which were derived from MOFs by a simple carbonization process.105 When used as a sulfur host material for cathodes of Li–S batteries, the RGO/C-Co-S electrode exhibited great electrochemical properties, including a great reversible capacity of 949 mA h g−1 at 0.3 A g−1 after 300 cycles and good rate capability with a discharge reversible capacity of 606 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1. Very recently, Wang and his group utilized ZIF-67 to fabricate a well-defined porous composite of N-doped Co3O4 embedded in N-doped nano-dodecahedral carbon (N–Co3O4@N-C) by a simple pyrolysis approach, followed by annealing treatment.106Fig. 7j shows the formation of N-Co3O4@N-C wrapped with RGO (N-Co3O4@N-C/RGO). After the sulfur was impregnated, the morphology of the dodecahedral structure was still maintained well (Fig. 7k and l). Owing to the well-defined porous framework, the N-Co3O4@N-C/RGO/S electrode with a large sulfur loading (5.89 mg cm−2) exhibited great cycling stability (611 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at 2 C) (Fig. 7m). This result can be ascribed to the synergistic effect of Co3O4 and MOF-derived porous carbon. Furthermore, the RGO and the porous structure could alleviate the volume variation effectively and prevent polysulfide diffusion, thereby suppressing the shuttle effect further during the charge/discharge process.
Apart from the above-mentioned porous carbon as a host material of S, porous TMOs have also been prepared as host materials. Li et al. prepared hierarchical mesoporous/microporous TiO2 derived from a MOF.107 The results showed that the chemical immobilization effect from Ti–S chemical bonding could effectively mitigate the issues, including the dissolution of lithium polysulfides, the deposition of Li2S/Li2S2, and the shuttle effect. The TiO2–S composite electrode displayed good cycling performance with a reversible specific capacity of 675 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 over 500 cycles when used as a cathode of Li–S batteries. Recently, Wang et al. prepared a highly conductive MOF-derived porous ternary nitrogen–carbon–cobalt (N–C–Co) composite to inhibit the polysulfide loss and shuttle effect in the electrolyte.108 The sample could deliver an initial discharge specific capacity of 1216.9 mA h g−1 at 1 C and maintain a capacity of 660.3 mA h g−1 after 250 cycles.


2.3.2 Li–Se batteries. 
S and selenium (Se) elements, which are in the same VI main group, possess many similar properties. Se has also received enormous attention as a cathode material for Li–Se batteries. Similar to that of Li–S batteries, the reaction mechanism of Li–Se batteries can be described as: 2Li+ + Se + 2e− ↔ Li2Se. Thus, a theoretical gravimetric capacity of 675 mA h g−1 was obtained.109–111 Similarly, Li–Se batteries also have the problems of Li–S batteries. To address these problems, composites of Se with carbon matrixes derived from MOFs have been manufactured. Li et al. prepared N-doped carbon sponges (NCSs) through the carbonization of MOFs under an Ar and NH3 flow atmosphere.112 As shown in Fig. 8a, the NCS was composed of carbon nanolayers and possessed a hierarchical porous structure. N-doping not only could further improve the electrical conductivity of the carbon matrix but also could inhibit the diffusion of polyselenides. As a result, the optimized NCS/Se-50 composite (50 wt% Se) exhibited excellent electrochemical performances when applied as a cathode material of Li–Se batteries. It could deliver a high initial discharge capacity of 982.6 mA h g−1 at 0.5 C (1 C = 675 mA g−1) (Fig. 8b). Significantly, the cathode material could achieve a capacity of 443.2 mA h g−1 at the 200th cycle (Fig. 8c). In addition, hollow hierarchical porous carbon spheres (MHPCSs) derived from MOFs have been fabricated by Liu and co-workers.113Fig. 8d shows the schematic synthesis process of MHPCS/Se composites. These MHPCSs were composed of plenty of small hollow carbon bubbles interconnected to each other (diameter size: ∼20 nm and shell thickness size: ∼5 nm). When used as a cathode material of a Li–Se battery, the MHPCS/Se composite (Fig. 8e) delivered a good initial specific capacity (588.2 mA h g−1 at 0.5 C), which was close to the theoretical value of Se (Fig. 8f). A reversible capacity of 260.8 mA h g−1 could be retained at 0.5 C even after 500 cycles (coulombic efficiency approaching 100%) (Fig. 8g). Recently, Liu et al. prepared hierarchically porous carbon microcubes (CMCs) derived from a Zn/Ni-MOF.114 The Se/CMC composite exhibited a discharge specific capacity of 780.4 mA h g−1 at 0.2 C when applied in a Li–Se battery. Compared with pristine Se, the Se/CMC cathode demonstrated a better rate capability (delivering a capacity of 420.4 mA h g−1 at 5 C).

2.4 MOF derivatives for Li–O2 batteries
Li–O2 batteries have also attracted tremendous attention because of their high theoretical energy density (3505 W h kg−1).115–118 During the discharge process, the following reactions occur in Li–O2 batteries: Li+ + e− + O2 → LiO2, Li+ + e− + LiO2 → Li2O2, and 2LiO2 → Li2O2 + O2.119,120 In general, the Li–O2 battery comprises a Li metal anode, electrolyte, and O2 electrode.121 O2 electrodes are usually composed of an electrically conductive porous material, which is required to provide channels for the transport of Li+ and O2, active sites for the reaction, and space for the deposition of discharged products.122 MOF-derived materials can meet these demands of O2 electrodes by offering a porous structure with high surface areas and adjustable chemical environments for specific interactions with guests.123 As a result, the electrode is enriched with O2. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during the charge and discharge process occur on the cathode side.118 Thus, desirable cathode catalysts are important in the ORR and OER. Considerable effort has been made to prepare cathode catalysts for the ORR and OER in Li–O2 batteries. However, several high-activity ORR/OER catalysts accelerate the reaction activity of side-reactions and increase the degradation of the electrolyte during the cycling process. To solve this problem, Yin et al. developed stable cathodes that were compatible with the electrolyte instead of pursuing high-activity catalysts.124 They utilized a MOF as a template to fabricate hierarchical mesoporous ZnO/ZnFe2O4/C (ZZFC) nanocages (Fig. 9a and b). The conductivity and optimized porosity of the sample could fit the needs of the Li–O2 cathode effectively. The sample delivered an initial discharge capacity of 11410 mA h g−1 at 300 mA g−1 when applied in a Li–O2 battery (Fig. 9c). Furthermore, the sample exhibited an improved cycling performance with a capacity of 5000 mA h g−1 for 15 cycles (Fig. 9d).

Tang et al. designed and prepared a novel cage-type highly graphitic porous carbon-Co3O4 (GPC-Co3O4) polyhedron by a two-step annealing treatment for core–shell structured MOFs (ZIF-8@ZIF-67) (Fig. 10a–c).125 As shown in Fig. 10c, the GPC-Co3O4 sample possessed a porous structure, which could facilitate the electrochemical reaction. When used as the O2 electrode in a Li–O2 battery, the GPC-Co3O4 cathode displayed a low charge overpotential of 0.58 V (Fig. 10d) and good rate capability. The good electrochemical performance could be ascribed to the structural properties, including a cage-type and mesoporous structure, high electronic conductivity, interior void space, and good dispersion of catalytically active Co3O4 nanoparticles.

2.5 MOF derivatives for Zn–air batteries
Similar to Li–O2 batteries, rechargeable Zn–air batteries also possess high energy density. Moreover, Zn–air batteries possess the merits of safety and easy production.3,126,127 Upon battery discharge, the electrochemical reaction mechanism can be described as the following equations: negative electrode: Zn + 4OH− → Zn(OH)42− + 2e−, and Zn(OH)42− → ZnO + H2O + 2OH−; positive electrode: O2 + 2H2O + 4e− → 4OH−; overall reaction: 2Zn + O2 → 2ZnO.3,128 However, the slow kinetics of the ORR and OER, which result in high overpotential, are still a serious technical issue.129 Noble metal-based materials such as platinum (Pt), ruthenium (Ru), and iridium (Ir)-based materials can exhibit outstanding electrocatalytic activity in the ORR and OER.130–133 Unfortunately, the high cost, scarcity, and poor cycling stability of these noble metals hinder their extensive application in the ORR and OER.134 Therefore, the pursuit of low-cost and stable electrocatalysts for replacing noble metal-based materials is an urgent need for rechargeable Zn–air batteries.135,136 Recently, MOF-derived materials have been employed as desirable electrocatalysts in Zn–air batteries. Zhu et al. reported a novel two-stage encapsulation method to fabricate transition metal nanoparticles coated on thin graphene nanosheets (TMs@NCX) for the ORR and OER.137Fig. 11a shows the schematic for the preparation of the TMs@NCX composite. By optimizing the reaction conditions, the NiFe@NCX catalyst showed excellent electrochemical performance. The TMs@NCX composite exhibited high stability and activity with an onset potential of 1.03 V for the ORR and a small overpotential of only 0.23 V at 10 mA cm−2 for the OER (Fig. 11b), which were much better than those of commercial IrO2 and Pt/C catalysts. Furthermore, the NiFe@NCX catalyst achieved a very small charge–discharge overpotential of 0.78 V at 50 mA cm−2, good reversibility, and stability (Fig. 11c).

To improve the catalytic properties of materials, N-doped carbon materials have been prepared.138,139 Meng et al. reported a multifunctional noble metal-free electrocatalyst.140 They prepared a composite by coupling of N-doped carbon with Co0.85Se nanocrystals (Co0.85Se@NC) derived from ZIF-67 through a one-step carbonization and selenylation procedure (Fig. 11d). Owing to the integration with a porous conductive carbon network, the Co0.85Se@NC catalyst exhibited excellent ORR and OER catalytic performance. They assembled rechargeable Zn–air batteries by using a zinc plate as the anode and the Co0.85Se@NC loaded on carbon fiber paper as the cathode (Fig. 11e). The Zn–air batteries exhibited a relatively low discharge/charge voltage gap of 0.8 V at 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 11f) and achieved a long-term cycle life up to 180 cycles. These results indicate that, through the rational design of the electrode, the Zn–air batteries can exhibit superior properties in the practical applications.
3. Applications of PB derivatives in rechargeable batteries
PB is a promising metal coordination compound with the general chemical formula of AxM[Fe(CN)6]y·nH2O. In general, A stands for alkali ions and M stands for transition metal ions. KFeII[FeIII(CN)6]·nH2O is a pristine PB, which is a popular synthetic blue pigment.141 Furthermore, the FeII can be substituted with other transition metals and the FeIII can be substituted with CoIII. The obtained compounds can be denoted as the PB analogue (PBA): AMII[MIII(CN)6]·nH2O (MII = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni and Zn, MIII = Fe or Co). PB and PBAs are usually heat treated to prepare PB derivatives because of their diversity.142,143 PB derivatives possess the characteristics of porosity and tunability, thereby attracting attention in rechargeable batteries.29,144
3.1 PB derivatives for LIBs

3.1.1 Metal oxides. 
PB-derived metal oxides mostly inherit the morphology of precursors and are widely studied. As early as 2012, Lou's group synthesized hierarchically structured Fe2O3 microboxes by simply annealing PB microcubes.145 As schematically illustrated in Fig. 12a, the formation of hierarchical Fe2O3 microboxes involved three stages. The Fe2O3 microboxes with distinct morphologies and structures were obtained at different temperatures (Fig. 12b–d). The Fe2O3 microboxes with a well-defined hollow structure and hierarchical shell manifested high specific capacity (∼950 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1) and excellent cycling performance when evaluated as the anode material for LIBs (Fig. 12e and f). After one year, Lou's group synthesized porous Fe2O3 nanocubes composed of fine Fe2O3 nanoparticles by simultaneous oxidative decomposition of PB nanocubes.146 The porous Fe2O3 nanocubes showed a high specific capacity of approximately 800 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1 and good cycling performance. In addition, Chen et al. synthesized porous Co3O4 polyhedra by the calcination of PBA (Co3[Co(CN)6]2) polyhedra.147 The final product represented hollow cavities on the surfaces of Co3O4 polyhedra (Fig. 12g and h). The sample had a reversible capacity of nearly 1229 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 when applied as an anode material for LIBs (Fig. 12i).

On the basis of the aforementioned PB/PBA-derived single metal oxide, Li et al. fabricated double-shelled hierarchical Fe2O3/Co3O4 microcubes via annealing double-shelled Fe4[Fe(CN)6]3/Co(OH)2 microcubes.148 According to the molar ratio of Fe/Co, the hollow Fe2O3/Co3O4 (1:1) microcube electrode exhibited the best cycling performance, achieving a specific capacity of 500 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at 100 mA g−1. The good electrochemical performance could be attributed to the unique microstructure and synergistic effect between the inner shell of Fe2O3 (acting as a stable support) and the outer shell of Co3O4. Recently, Yang et al. utilized a PB precursor to prepare porous ZnO/ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles by microwave irradiation in Zn acetate solution, followed by annealing treatment in air.149 PB is convenient for preparing porous structures. Thus, the final ZnO/ZnFe2O4 composite possessed a porous framework. The composite exhibited a good capacity of 804 mA h g−1 at 1000 mA g−1 after 500 cycles when applied as an anode of LIBs. Hou et al. developed a simple method to fabricate hierarchical mesoporous bimetallic ZnO/ZnFe2O4 sub-microcubes (ZZFO) by annealing Zn3[Fe(CN)6]2 cubes.26 The discharge specific capacity of the ZZFO remained relatively stable after 200 cycles and was even maintained as high as around 837 mA h g−1 at 1000 mA g−1. Yang et al. utilized the composite of (Fe4[Fe(CN)6]3/Mx[Fe(CN)6], M = Cu, Co, Ni, etc.) to synthesize a porous Fe2O3–CuO composite.150 This sample also exhibited a good electrochemical property (a specific capacity of 774 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1 after 120 cycles). This study demonstrated a general strategy for preparing porous metal oxide composites.
Binary TMOs have also been manufactured using PBA precursors. As early as 2012, Hu et al. fabricated spinel MnxCo3−xO4 porous nanocubes by annealing PBA (Mn3[Co(CN)6]2·nH2O) under moderate conditions.151 The as-prepared composite exhibited a good reversible specific capacity of 733 mA h g−1 after 30 cycles at 200 mA g−1 and good cycling performance owing to its specific foam-like porous structure. Similarly, Liu et al. proposed a PBA-derived strategy to prepare hollow porous bimetallic FexCo3−xO4.152


3.1.2 Carbon-based materials. 
The combination of active materials with carbon materials can obviously improve the electrochemical properties. Wang et al. fabricated hollow N-doped Fe3O4/C nanocages with hierarchical porosities via carbonizing polydopamine-coated PB.153 The unique hollow nanocages exhibited a good specific capacity of 878.7 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 200 mA g−1 owing to their high electrical conductivity and well-defined hierarchical porous structure.
The derived metal carbides are also obtained by annealing in an N2 atmosphere. Ma et al. adopted a simple and effective strategy to prepare pitaya-like microspheres with carbide nanoparticles (Co3ZnC) well-distributed and implanted in mesoporous carbon spherical frameworks.154 As demonstrated in Fig. 13a, the synthetic method mainly consisted of an ultra-sonication-assisted solution-phase approach and a subsequent annealing process. The PBA precursor was converted into a bimetallic carbide/carbon composite with a good distribution of C, N, Co, and Zn elements and a highly porous structure (Fig. 13c–e). The porous carbon structure provided channels for Li+ diffusion and restricted the thin solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer to the outer surface of carbon shells (Fig. 13b). The composite delivered a large capacity of 608 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 300 cycles and good rate performance with a capacity of 423 mA h g−1 at 1000 mA g−1 (Fig. 13f and g).

3.2 PB derivatives for SIBs
Through the rational design of PB-derived materials, favorable electrode materials can be fabricated for SIBs. Chen et al. fabricated carbon-coated bimetallic sulfide hollow nanocubes (PBCS) derived from a polydopamine/PB composite.155 The PBCS can alleviate the structural collapse generated from severe volume variation during the charge/discharge process. Metal sulfides also possess good electrical conductivity and high theoretical capacity when applied as electrode materials of SIBs. The integration of these features provided PBCS a good sodium storage performance. The PBCS achieved a discharge capacity of about 500 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1. In addition, a discharge capacity of 122.3 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1 could be obtained, showing good rate performance. Recently, Lim et al. employed a facile solvothermal method to prepare WS2@N-doped carbon nanocubes (Fig. 14a), in which N-doped carbon was derived from PB.156 The electrochemical reaction mechanism of WS2 during the discharge process can be described as the following equations: (1) 4Na+ + WS2 + 4e− → Na4WS2; (2) Na4WS2 → W + 2Na2S. As demonstrated in Fig. 14b–d, the unique well-defined 3D porous hierarchical structure comprised nitrogen doped carbon (NC) nanocubes and WS2 nanosheets. The sample displayed great electrochemical performance when used as an anode material in SIBs. It displayed rate capacities of 384 and 151 mA h g−1 at 100 and 5000 mA g−1, respectively (Fig. 14e). Importantly, the discharge specific capacity of this material was 320 mA h g−1 under 200 mA g−1 after 200 cycles (Fig. 14f).

Recently, TMPs have been studied as anode materials for SIBs. Li et al. employed a low-temperature phosphorization process to synthesize core–shell porous FeP@CoP microcubes interconnected by RGO (RGO@CoP@FeP) (Fig. 15a and b).157 The electrochemical reaction mechanism of the electrode material belong to the conversion reaction and can be described as the following equation: Co(Fe)P + 3Na+ + 3e− → Co(Fe) + Na3P. When used as an SIB anode material, the RGO@CoP@FeP electrode delivered a high initial discharge specific capacity of 968 mA h g−1 and showed a good cycling stability, maintaining 456.2 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 100 mA g−1 (Fig. 15c). It also exhibited excellent rate capability. The good electrochemical performance could be attributed to the special nanostructure of the sample. The core–shell structure can provide enough buffering spaces for volume variation, as well as shorten the Na+ diffusion distance. The interconnected RGO nanosheets can not only greatly facilitate the charge transfer processes but also act as a protecting layer to buffer volume variation.

3.3 PB derivatives for Li–S batteries
PB-derived materials have also been studied as the sulfur support for Li–S batteries. Zhao et al. prepared porous Fe2O3 by the annealing treatment of PB.158 The synthesized porous Fe2O3 could act as an internal polysulfide reservoir to reduce the shuttle effect. A stable reversible capacity of nearly 574.3 mA h g−1 at 0.5 C after 50 cycles could be obtained when used as the cathode of Li–S batteries.
Su et al. developed a simple one-step method to fabricate 3D N-doped graphene–carbon nanotube hybrids (Fe3C@NGE–CNTs) by utilizing a low-cost PB precursor.159Fig. 16a shows the synthesis process for the Fe3C@N-GE–CNT hybrid. The annealed sample possessed a typical hierarchical structure consisting of GE, CNTs, and Fe3C (Fig. 16b and c). As illustrated in Fig. 16d, CNTs replicate the shape of the Fe3C catalyst on the GE substrate. The cathode based on Fe3C@NGE–CNTs demonstrated outstanding electrochemical performance (Fig. 16e and f), including a large reversible capacity (1221 mA h g−1 at 0.2 C rate, 1 C = 1673 mA g−1), excellent rate capability (458 and 220 mA h g−1 at 5 and 10 C, respectively), and good cycling stability (321 and 164 mA h g−1 at 5 C and 10 C after 1000 cycles), when applied in Li–S batteries. These excellent electrochemical properties were ascribed to the synergistic effect between the unique 3D structure and N doping. Especially, the N doping not only could generate active sites and defects to facilitate the interfacial adsorption but also could enable the effective trapping of lithium polysulfides on electroactive sites within the cathode. This strategy could provide a feasible way to synthesize desirable hybrid materials for high-performance Li–S batteries.

4. Applications of POM derivatives in rechargeable batteries
POMs are a class of anionic nano-sized metal–oxygen clusters with the general formula of [MxOy]n− (M = Mo, W, V, etc.).160–162 POM-derivatives, such as MoxOy, WxOy, and VxOy, can be obtained through annealing treatment. These POM-derivatives can be applied as electrode materials for LIBs because of their attractive properties. Qi et al. reported the fabrication of a MoO3/TiO2 nanotubular composite through the layer-by-layer self-assemble approach.163 Using different loadings of POM, the contents of MoO3 in the MoO3/TiO2 nanocomposites could be tuned desirably. The optimized sample exhibited good electrochemical performance. It delivered a high discharge capacity of 1126.2 mA h g−1 and maintained 483.3 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1. Wang et al. synthesized two composites L-MoS2 and D-MoS2 (Fig. 17a and b) by chelation and pyrolysis of POM and dithiooxamide (DTO) or L-cysteine (derived from L-cysteine-POM and DTO-POM complexes, respectively).164 The D-MoS2 and L-MoS2 exhibited great Li-storage performance with high discharge capacities of approximately 2150 mA h g−1 and 1300 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 after 600 and 800 cycles, respectively (Fig. 17c and d).

The POM-derived materials could also be utilized as cathode materials for LIBs. Wang et al. successfully prepared γ-phase LiV2O5 (γ-LiV2O5) via annealing a polyoxovanadate cluster (Li7[V15O36(CO3)]) (Fig. 17e).165 The material could achieve a reversible capacity of about 250 mA h g−1 (Fig. 17f). The results of X-ray absorption near edge structure and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterization indicated that the γ-LiV2O5 material underwent a two-electron redox reaction per V2O5 pyramid unit. Moreover, the structure of the material remained stable during the reaction. The valence change is between V4+ and V5+ during the lithiation/delithiation process (Fig. 17g).
5. Others
Cyanometallic framework derived materials have also attracted attention in rechargeable batteries. Chen et al. reported the synthesis of hierarchical porous Fe2O3/NiO microflowers derived from a cyanometallic framework (Fe(H2O)2[Ni(CN)4]) and applied it as an anode material in LIBs.166 The hierarchical porous Fe2O3/NiO electrode exhibited a high lithium storage capacity of 1652.6 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and maintained a capacity of 1210.4 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles. Recently, they prepared a CoMoO4/Co3O4 nanocomposite using another cyanometallic framework precursor (Co2[Mo(CN)8]·xH2O).167 As an anode material of LIBs, the sample delivered a remarkable electrochemical performance, including a large lithium storage capacity of 1175.1 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1, a high initial coulombic efficiency (86.9%), an excellent cycling stability (96.9% capacity retention for the 100th cycle), and an outstanding rate capability (924.2 mA h g−1 at 2000 mA g−1). The excellent electrochemical performance of the CoMoO4/Co3O4 composite can be attributed to the hollow porous structure of cyanometallic framework derived materials, which could provide more efficient electrochemical active sites, shorten pathways for ion diffusion, and accommodate the serious volume variation during the charge/discharge cycling process. In addition, the synergistic effect of different components may also contribute to the electrochemical performance.

Table 1 shows a systematic summary for the electrochemical performance of the coordination compound-derived materials. For LIBs or SIBs, most of the electrode materials are transition metal compound-based materials. These materials (except for TiO2, which is based on the intercalation/deintercalation mechanism) exhibit high specific capacities because of their conversion reaction mechanism or alloying–dealloying reaction mechanism. Furthermore, these materials exhibit good cycling performance due to their special nanostructure. However, most of these materials exhibit a large initial irreversible capacity loss. This is mainly caused by the over consumption of electrolytes to form an SEI layer during the first discharge process. For Li–S batteries and Li–Se batteries, coordination compound-derived carbon-based materials are used as the loading support for S and Se. The cathodes based on these composites exhibit high specific capacity and long cycling stability. In addition, as the O2 electrode materials of Li–O2 batteries and Zn–air batteries, coordination compound-derived materials exhibit good catalytic performance for the ORR and OER (the performance of Li–O2 batteries and Zn–air batteries is not shown in Table 1 because their performance parameters are different from those of other batteries).

6. Conclusions and outlooks
This review summarized the recent progress of coordination compound-derived materials applied in rechargeable batteries, including LIBs, SIBs, Li–S batteries, Li–Se batteries, Li–O2 batteries, and Zn–air batteries. By proper treatment of coordination compound materials, functional nanostructured materials can be obtained. These materials can be used as active materials, the loading support of active materials, or electrocatalysts for the ORR and OER. When used as electrode materials of LIBs and SIBs, the nanoporous structure of coordination compound-derived materials can facilitate the transport of electrolyte and accommodate the volume expansion/contraction of active materials during charging/discharging. Moreover, for the TMOs@carbon, TMSs@carbon, and TMPs@carbon composites, the carbon matrix possesses several merits during the electrochemical reaction. Initially, the electrical conductivity of the electrode can be improved due to the existence of carbon. Meanwhile, it can impede the volume expansion and pulverization of active materials during the lithiation/delithiation process, thereby enhancing the cycling performance. Moreover, the well-dispersed carbon matrix plays vital roles of isolating the active particles from each other and preventing Ostwald ripening. When used as the loading support of the active materials of Li–S and Li–Se batteries, the nanoporous structure of coordination compound-derived carbon materials can retard the diffusion of polysulfides or polyselenides and the carbon matrix can provide an excellent conductive network. Furthermore, sulfur/carbon or selenium/carbon cathodes, which are based on N-doped porous carbon, exhibit better cycling performance. The reason is that the N-doping enables the effective trapping effect for lithium polysulfides or polyselenides within the cathode. When used as the electrode materials of Li–O2 and Zn–air batteries, coordination compound-derived carbon materials present the following characteristics: these materials usually exhibit a bifunctional catalytic effect for the ORR and OER; the 3D continuous porous structure of the material is very beneficial to the transport of the electrolyte and the diffusion of O2; the high specific surface area of the material can provide a large number of active sites for the electrochemical reaction. Therefore, coordination compound derivatives are promising candidates for the electrodes of rechargeable batteries.
Considerable published literature indicates that future application of coordination compound-derived materials in rechargeable batteries is still challenging. To further improve the electrochemical performance of coordination compound derivatives, the following aspects should be given attention:
(1) The heat treatment of coordination compounds is critical to the properties and porous structure parameters of the coordination compound-derived materials. This topic deserves a comprehensive study.
(2) For Li–S, Li–Se, and Li–O2 batteries, the loading support for sulfur, selenium, and Li2O2/Li2O needs to have a large pore volume. Therefore, the design of coordination compound precursors with a hierarchical porous structure is an important research direction in this field.
(3) For Li–O2 and Zn–air batteries, the pursuit of high-performance bifunctional catalysts in the ORR and OER is the key to reduce the over-potential of the batteries. Compared with the single-metal/metal oxide catalysts, mixed metal/metal oxide catalysts usually possess better performance due to their synergistic effect. The heat treatment for the mixed metal coordination compound is a very efficient way to obtain mixed metal/metal oxide catalysts.
(4) High-degree graphitization of carbon materials can improve the electron transfer rate and can thus enhance the conductivity of electrodes in batteries. The electrochemical stability of electrode materials can also be improved through high-degree graphitization. According to considerable published literature, the coordination compounds consisting of the benzene component can largely facilitate the formation of carbon materials with high-degree graphitization. The preparation of coordination-derived carbon materials with high-degree graphitization through choosing appropriate coordination compound precursors and the corresponding formation mechanism are worth studying systematically.
(5) The electronic conductivity and electrocatalytic activity of the coordination compound-derived carbon materials can usually be enhanced through heteroatom doping. Thus, heteroatom doping is also an important research direction in the field.
(6) Coordination compound-derived materials usually possess a high specific surface area, which can enhance the kinetic performance of electrode materials. However, when used as electrode materials of LIBs and SIBs, the high specific surface area also causes some problems, especially over consumption of electrolyte to form an SEI layer and too low initial coulombic efficiency. Therefore, it is necessary to design electrode materials with a moderate specific surface area to suppress the side effects.
