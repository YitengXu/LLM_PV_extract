    , Accepted 14th March 2019First published on 26th March 2019AbstractWith the increasing concern for discovering a new processing additive, the effects of polymer additives (polystyrene, poly(styrene-b-pentafluorostyrene) and poly(pentafluorostyrene)) on the PBDB-TT5:ITIC blend system were thoroughly investigated to obtain a direct comparison with the widely used volatile solvent 1,8-diiodooctane additive. Although different additive types (solid vs. solvent) act via different mechanisms within the active layer, the use of each optimal amount enables improved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) to various extents. Among them, viscous PPFS was found to be the most effective, resulting in a remarkable improvement in the PCE from 7.90% to 9.29%. Interestingly, the PPFS has a high dielectric constant that can not only induce the enhanced dielectric property of the active layer but also serves as a morphological locking-in agent, conferring long-term and thermal device stabilities. Moreover, we successfully improved the PCEs for other host systems (J71:ITIC, PTB7-Th:PC71BM, and PTB7-Th:PNDI-T10) through PPFS addition. For J71:ITIC, the PCE reached a maximum of up to 10.7%. Our study highlights that the use of PPFS is a simple and practical technique to improve the PCE and stability of devices, with the expectation that further molecular design involving high dielectric constant polymer additives will likely obtain more interesting results in various optoelectronics.
Introduction
With the increasing demand for sustainable and renewable energy sources, the field of bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) has been a prolific research ground owing to the possibility of combining an inexpensive technology, mechanical flexibility, and the prospect of integration using conformable materials. Critical to the efficient operation of BHJ OSCs is the nanoscale phase-separated morphology composed of electron-donating and electron-accepting phases. Thus, many methods, including thermal and solvent annealing1–4 and the use of solvent processing additives, have been explored to achieve such a morphology.5–8 Among these, the use of solvent additives is particularly of interest because of its easy implementation and effectiveness in enhancing the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs. Various solvent processing additives (e.g., 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO),9–14 1,8-dichlorooctane (DClO),15 and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN)16–19) have been used and have demonstrated significant PCE improvements on many types of OSC platforms,20–23 although they operate via different mechanisms. In general, owing to the high boiling points of solvent additives, its small volume fraction remains in the active layer after finalizing the fabrication of the devices. In fact, the peak performance BHJ morphology derived from the solvent additives only represents a metastable state.24,25 Therefore, the residual solvent additives can induce an additional morphology evolution upon the optimized BHJ film, thus often lowering the OSC performance with poor reproducibility in various methods. To resolve this negative influence, removing the residual solvent additives requires additional steps (e.g., thermal annealing and/or high vacuum), even though it is very sensitive to the drying kinetics.26
Therefore, non-volatile solid additives, which indefinitely retain the blend film after casting, have been assumed to accurately control the morphology via a one-step fabrication process.27 For the first non-volatile polymer additive, Reynolds et al. reported that the use of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as a polymeric oil additive led to ∼70% improvement in the PCE compared with the non-additive control device.28 Bazan et al. also demonstrated that adding a small amount of polystyrene (PS) into an active layer improves the macroscopic film uniformity and decreases unnecessary de-wetting from the substrate.29,30 Thereafter, our group systematically examined the effects of various polymer additives (PS, PDMS, and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)) versus the extensively used solvent DIO additive on the morphology and photovoltaic property of a model small-molecule BHJ system.31 In this study, the PMMA additive most effectively improved the PCE even better than the DIO case. A series of investigations on the effects of the polymer additives not only proved that these additives could develop an optimized morphology and ultimately enhance the device performance but also aided in understanding the mechanisms underlying their influence. However, developing novel polymer additives that are more effective in enhancing the performance and can be successfully applied to various active layers, which can be implemented in ink formulations processable using roll-to-roll compatible equipment, should also be the focus.
In this study, we synthesized fluorinated analogs of PS with various fluorine contents in the backbone (poly(styrene-b-pentafluorostyrene) (PS-b-PPFS) diblock copolymer, and poly(pentafluorostyrene) (PPFS)). We also investigated the influence of novel fluorinated polymer additives on the film morphology and device performance, as well as PS and DIO, for a comparative study to provide valuable insights into the appropriate selection of polymer additives to be used in molecular BHJ OSCs. Note that the non-fullerene OSCs (NF-OSCs) have strongly elicited an increasing attention in the research community owing to their excellent potential over conventional fullerene-based OSCs.11,32–39 However, a thorough study that explores the processing additives’ effects on the non-fullerene OSCs is rarely conducted. Thus, a non-fullerene OSC based on the PBDB-TT5:ITIC was selected as a test-bed host platform. Our investigation showed that the PCE and stability of the PBDB-TT5:ITIC device were simultaneously enhanced when the active layer was processed with the PPFS additive. By utilizing a series of characterizations, including morphology, charge-carrier properties, and dielectric constants, we concluded that the combined effects of the specific interactions of PPFS with active components and enhanced dielectric property within the active layer were identified as possible origins of the observed superior photovoltaic characteristics. Moreover, the use of PPFS led to improved PCEs in other systems, i.e., J71:ITIC (PCE, from 9.68% to 10.70%), PTB7-Th:PC71BM (from 8.29% to 8.70%), and PTB7-Th:PNDI-T10 (from 5.68% to 6.10%), thus verifying a significant prospect for its applicability in various OSC systems.
Results and discussion
Materials and characterization
First, the isothermal atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of styrene at 110 °C in p-xylene solution was performed using 1-bromoethyl benzene, according to PS with bromine chain-end functionality as a macroinitiator. Aside from the protons of the broad aromatic and aliphatic regions of the repeating units of PS, the inspection of its NMR spectrum clearly revealed the signals at 4.35–4.60 ppm assigned to the protons located on the carbon beside bromine at the growing polymer chain end (Fig. S1, ESI†). Subsequently, the diblock copolymer, PS-b-PPFS, was synthesized by ATRP in p-xylene, employing the PS as the macroinitiator. Compared with that of the PS macroinitiator, the gel permeation chromatography (GPC) elution curve of PS-b-PPFS demonstrated a significant shift toward high molecular weight without any shoulder trace of unreacted PS, indicating the involvement of almost macroinitiator chains in initiating the ATRP of the PFS monomer. In addition, we prepared the PPFS homopolymer by using a typical radical polymerization. Detailed synthetic procedures and characterizations of all the polymers are presented, as well as their GPC-determined average molecular weights and polydispersities, in the experimental section. The neat films of the resultant polymer additives were prepared by spin-casting on the glass/Al substrate to determine the dielectric constants (εr) using capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements, where a film thickness of more than 230 nm is required to obtain reliable results. The measurements were performed in the frequency range of 102–105 Hz at room temperature. The relative dielectric constants of PS, PS-b-PPFS, and PPFS as a function of frequency were calculated using εr = Cd/ε0A, where C is the capacitance, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, A is the device area (0.22 cm2), and d is the thickness of the films (Fig. 1). With a high degree of fluorine content in the polymer repeat unit, the calculated dielectric constants monotonically increased, being in the order of PS (εr = ∼2.12) < PS-b-PPFS (εr = ∼4.03) < PPFS (εr = ∼5.17).

Photovoltaic properties
Using the three as-prepared polymer additives, we conducted a study on how these additives influence the photovoltaic performance of OSCs. A conventional device with a structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/PBDB-TT5:ITIC/perylene diimide functionalized with amino N-oxide (PDINO)/Al was fabricated (Fig. 2b), where PDINO was selected as the cathode interlayer to lower the work function of Al. Fig. 2a and c show the molecular structures of the active components and polymer additives, as well as the energy diagram of all the materials involved in the OSCs. According to our recent study,40 the weight ratio of PBDB-TT5:ITIC was 1:1 with a total blend concentration of 20 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene. The active layer film was spin-coated, followed by the thermal annealing treatment at 150 °C for 10 min (see Experimental section for the detailed device fabrication). The representative current-density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices with the illumination of simulated AM 1.5G conditions (100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 3a, and the relevant parameters are summarized in Table 1. All other device data examined in this study are presented in Fig. S4 and Table S1 (ESI†). First, the devices without additives have an optimal PCE of 7.90%, with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 14.30 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.86 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 65.3%. Then, we began to evaluate the effect of the additives on the OSC performance. Then, the effect of various amounts of DIO additive was partially screened. The result showed that the best device was prepared using the 0.5% (v/v) of DIO additive reached a PCE of 8.63%, with JSC = 14.36 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.87 V, and FF = 68.8%. By adding up to 5.0% (w/w) to the active layer, the optimal amount became 2.0% (w/w) for all the polymer additives. As observed in the DIO addition, the use of the polymer additives on the PBDB-TT5:ITIC film enhanced the overall PCEs. Note that for the DIO-processed system, the large increase in FF with only a marginal change in JSC is highly responsible for the enhanced PCE. However, in all cases with polymer additives, the JSC and VOC values properly increased together with moderate enhancement in FF. Further, the highest performance enhancement occurred for the optimal amount of PPFS addition, thus boosting the PCEs up to 9.29%, even better than the DIO case, mainly attributable to the notable increase in both JSC and VOC. We also noted that the enhanced VOC values of both PS- and PPFS-processed devices relative to the non-additive value could be attributed to the synergistic properties of the tuned dielectric property and morphology upon their addition, which will be properly discussed in the below sections. As shown in Fig. 3b, all the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves for the optimized devices exhibit good photovoltaic responses in the range of 370–750 nm, which can be ascribed to the complementary absorptions of PBDB-TT5 and ITIC. The EQE values evidently increased when the additives were used, particularly PPFS, which was consistent with the trend of the JSC values obtained from J–V measurements. Considering that all the films had the same PBDB-TT5:ITIC composition and thickness, the large difference in the photovoltaic performance must be from the charge-carrier dynamics and morphology, which are analyzed and discussed in the following section.

Charge-carrier dissociation, transport, and recombination dynamics
First, the charge-carrier mobilities of the optimized blend films without and with various additives were determined using the space-charge-limited current method, obtained from the thickness between 100 nm and 150 nm. The plots of the current density versus the voltage of the devices for mobility measurements are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), and the results are summarized in Table 1. The hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities for the blend film without additives were 1.40 × 10−4 and 3.37 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The results indicated that DIO addition improved both the μh and μe values. Moreover, by adding polymer additives, the μh values increased in the DIO case, but the change in μes seemed rather dependent on their types. For example, PS-b-PPFS addition resulted in very similar μe values compared with the blend film processed without additive, where the μe values for the films containing PS or PPFS evidently dropped to 1.47 × 10−4–2.66 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Consequently, the films processed with the additives have better-balanced μe and μh values than the non-additive processed film. The accumulation of charges (μe and μh) is detrimental to the FF of the device, which is one of the reasons for the relatively low FF obtained in the OSC without additives.
We also explored the dependence of the J–V characteristics at various light intensities to investigate the recombination process in the devices without and with additives. Quantitatively, JSC follows a power-law dependence on light intensity (I) (JSC ∝ Iα), where α is the exponential factor, implying the extent of the bimolecular recombination. If all free charge carriers were swept out and collected at the electrodes prior to recombination, then α is supposed to be 1; however, α < 1. Thus, it was determined that bimolecular recombination somewhat exists.41,42 When compared with the additive-free blend film (α = 0.962), larger slopes (0.964–0.972) in the J–I plots are observed for all of the additive cases (Fig. 4a), indicating the smaller extent of bimolecular recombination. In general, the low bimolecular recombination correlates with the high FF achieved in the devices. Note that for the devices with polymer additives, the observed slightly lower FF values relative to those that contain DIO is most likely due to the slightly thickened active layers (more than 100 nm) induced by their viscosity. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 4b, the slopes (kT/q) of VOCversus the logarithm of I (k, T, and q are the Boltzmann constant, temperature, and elementary charge, respectively) are 1.78, 1.75, 1.64, 1.49, and 1.46 for the additive-free, DIO, PS, PS-b-PPFS, and PPFS cases, respectively, indicating a relatively weak trap-assisted recombination process in the PS-b-PPFS- and PPFS-containing devices.41

To further understand the influence of the additives on the charge dynamics of the NF-OSC platform, we measured the photocurrent (Jph) on the effective voltage (Veff) (Fig. 4c). Jph was defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD were the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively; and Veff = V0 − V, where V0 is the compensation voltage when Jph = 0 and V is the applied voltage. The J–V plots indicate that Jph almost saturates for Veff > 1 V for all tested devices. The exciton dissociation probability P(E,T) versus the applied voltage was termed the Jph/Jsat ratio. The P(E,T) values under short-circuit conditions were 92.3%, 93.5%, 95.2%, 94.6%, and 95.8% for the additive-free, DIO, PS, PS-b-PPFS, and PPFS devices, respectively (Fig. 4d and Table S2, ESI†). Despite the decreased change in the P(E,T) values at the maximized power output voltage for all the cases, the PPFS-processed device showed the highest P(E,T) retention of 82.2%, suggesting facilitated charge dissociation and extraction. By combining the results of the light intensity dependence of JSC and VOC, as well as the voltage dependence of Jph, weak recombination loss occurred in addition to superior charge extraction and collection efficiency in the additive-containing OSCs, particularly for the PPFS-based one, accounting for its superior photovoltaic performance.
Morphological properties
We analyzed the morphology and molecular packing characteristics of the blend films as a function of the additives via the grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 5, all the blend films exhibited a lamellar packing (100) diffuse ring at q ≈ 0.292 Å−1 and a strong π–π stacking (010) reflection peak at q ≈ 1.685 Å−1 in the in-plane direction, implying a preferable face-on molecular packing orientation with respect to the substrate. For all the cases, the similar locations of both (100) and (010) peaks were also observed, thereby indicating that the lamellar and π–π stacking distances remain almost unchanged after adding the additives. Moreover, the (010) π-stacking crystallite coherence lengths (CCL010) determined using the Scherrer equation evidently showed the additive type-dependent behavior (Table S3, ESI†). For example, the CCL010 values slightly increased upon the addition of DIO, PS, or PS-b-PPFS, whereas these values inversely decreased with the PPFS additive, resulting in the smallest value of 19.88 Å in the PPFS-containing film. This phenomenon can be attributed to the enhanced inter-miscibility between the PBDB-TT5 and ITIC components caused by the addition of the PPFS additive.6,31,43–45 Thus, this additive played an important role in achieving the highest PCE of the PPFS-containing device. As shown in the AFM images of Fig. S6 (ESI†), the smallest root-mean-square roughness value observed from the PPFS-containing film can further evidence the most intermixed feature. In addition, although the TEM images show difficulty in clearly resolving the differences of each blend film, all the blend films with additives showed slightly better phase separation than the non-additive one (Fig. S6, ESI†), which can be beneficial for exciton separation and charge transport.

Device stability
Aside from the PCE values, the stability of the OSC devices was also recognized as another important area of research, both in academia and in the industries. Regarding this issue, over the course of this study, we conducted a study on the stability of the optimized five devices based on PBDB-TT5:ITIC. First, we evaluated the thermal stability of the devices, where testing was performed at temperatures ranging from 150 °C to 250 °C for 10 min periods in the inert atmosphere. The changing trends of the photovoltaic parameters are illustrated in Fig. 6 and Fig. S7 (ESI†). Although the thermal treatment at extremely high temperatures (more than 200 °C) led to the decreased values of all the photovoltaic parameters in all the devices, the performance degradation for the PPFS-containing device relative to the others was suppressed to some extent. Moreover, the PPFS-containing device demonstrated superior long-term thermal stability at 150 °C, reached during the practical application of OSCs. After 8 h of annealing at 150 °C, as opposed to the sharp PCE drops observed for the other devices, the PPFS-containing device retained a PCE of as high as 7.59%. Moreover, we performed a long-term stability test of the devices without encapsulation under an inert atmosphere at room temperature for 20 days. In all cases, during the period of 20 days, the VOCs became slightly stable. However, a sharp decline in both JSC and FF was observed, leading to the PCE degradation. Therefore, the use of PPFS can likely promote the long-term stability of the devices, resulting in the highest levels of retention in the PCEs (>7.82%). Note also that the devices with the polymer additives generally exhibit far better stability than the DIO-processed one, which immediately degraded during the device stability testing, even worse than the non-additive case.

As discussed previously, thicker films were produced after incorporating the polymer additives into the active layer, evidence for the specific mutual interactions between the existing blend components and polymer additives. Therefore, we concluded that the morphology stabilization induced by the viscous polymer additives is one contributing factor for the enhanced stability of the devices upon their addition. Such similar results caused by the polymer additives were also reported in several recent studies.46–48 However, we still had a question as to why the use of PPFS became the most effective means to simultaneously improve and stabilize the performance, even though it has the lowest molecular weight, presumably possessing a lower viscosity than the other polymer additives used in this study. The answer to this question may be highly related to the enhanced dielectric property within the active layer derived from the existence of high-dielectric-constant PPFS additives. To address our assumption, we determined the dielectric constant of the optimized blend films with each polymer additive via impedance spectroscopy. Fig. S8 (ESI†) illustrates the relative dielectric constants of the optimized blend films with DIO, PS, PS-b-PPFS, and PPFS as a frequency function. The dielectric constant values manifested in the sequence of PS- < DIO ≈ PS-b-PPFS- < PPFS-containing films, being consistent with the trends of the capacitance-derived dielectric constants of the neat films above. Note that the enhancement of the dielectric constant value of the blend films with DIO would result from the desired blend morphology compared with the neat blend one.49,50
This result confirms that the use of the PPFS additive can accurately increase the dielectric property of the active layer, which strongly correlates to the observed exceptional performance and stability compared with other polymer additive cases, based on the following rationales. Enhancing the dielectric constant for the OSC application can be beneficial in achieving high PCEs with expected aspects (e.g., reducing recombination events, enhancing charge separation at the donor/acceptor interface, and decreasing the singlet–triplet energy gap).50–54
We further extended the use of the PPFS additive to other types of OSCs with J71:ITIC, PTB7-Th:PC71BM, and PTB7-Th:PNDI-T10 active layers to explore its versatility (Fig. S9, ESI†). The J–V characteristics of the devices are presented in Fig. S10 (ESI†), and the corresponding photovoltaic performance is summarized in Table S4 (ESI†). All the data are results based on the optimized concentration of DIO and PPFS. Fig. 7 summarizes the PCE values of different types of BHJ PSCs with and without DIO and PPFS. As observed in all the cases, significantly enhanced PCE values were obtained from PPFS-containing devices compared to the corresponding control without PPFS (PCE from 9.68% to 10.70% for J71:ITIC; PCE from 8.29% to 8.70% for PTB7-Th:PC71BM; and PCE from 5.68% to 6.10% for PTB7-Th:PNDI-T10). Specifically, PPFS addition consistently improved the PCEs, whereas the DIO additive showed a negative effect in the cases of J71:ITIC and PTB7-Th:PNDI-T10. This result suggests the PPFS additive as a versatile method of the experimental control in improving OSC performance.

Conclusions
In summary, we have presented an investigation on nonvolatile solid polymers (PS, PS-b-PPFS, and PPFS) versus the extensively used volatile solvent processing DIO and their effect as additives on the morphology and photovoltaic performance of the PBDB-TT5:ITIC test-bed system. High dielectric constant values were observed for the polymer additives with high concentrations of fluorine (PS < PS-b-PPFS < PPFS). The results of this study showed that all the additives improved the device performance with the highest improvement obtained with PPFS (from a PCE of 7.90% to 9.29%). Moreover, the PPFS-containing device exhibited a superior device (e.g., long-term and thermal) stability compared to the others. The intriguing results regarding both PCE and stability accounted for the combined effects of the specific interactions and enhanced dielectric property of the PPFS, evidenced by the change in the morphology and dielectric constant of the active layer upon adding PFFS. Moreover, we applied the PPFS additive into the other blend systems (J71:ITIC, PTB7-Th:PC71BM, and PTB7-Th:PNDI-T10). In all cases, the use of PPFS boosted performance, particularly for J71:ITIC, providing an increase in the PCE of as high as 10.70%. Our findings demonstrate that PPFS is an excellent additive with broad-spectrum applicability for efficient and stable OSCs.
Experimental section
Materials and instruments
All the chemical materials and solvents for this study were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd and Alfa Aesar chemical company. Unless otherwise specified, such chemicals were used without any further purification. PBDB-TT5 and ITIC were synthesized according to a previously reported procedure. DIO and PS were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Other additives, PS-b-PPFS and PPFS, were synthesized using atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). The detailed synthesis methods can be found in the ESI.†1H NMR was performed in deuterated chloroform, using a 400 MHz FT-NMR spectrometer (Bruker). The number average molecular weights (Mn) and the PDI of the polymer products were determined using gel permeation chromatography (GPC) conducted at 23 °C in tetrahydrofuran (THF) at a flow rate of 1 mL min−1, using an Agilent 1260 Infinity GPC system. Monodisperse PS standard (Polymer Laboratories) was used for calibration.
Device fabrication
The patterned ITO-coated glass substrates were rinsed using detergent, acetone and isopropanol and were subsequently dried overnight in an oven at 80 °C. The NF-PSCs were fabricated with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINO/Al. PEDOT:PSS (Bayer Baytron 4083) and spin-coated at 4000 rpm onto an ITO substrate, followed by annealing at 140 °C for 15 min in air. The active layer was spin-coated from chlorobenzene solution with a D:A weight ratio of 1:1 w/w% and heated at 45 °C overnight under stirring. For each polymer additives case, 1 to 5 w/w% of the total active layer concentration (while in DIO case, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 v/v% of the solvent volume) was used in the preparation of the additive-based active layer solution, followed by thermal annealing treatment at 150 °C for 10 min. Then, a methanol solution of PDINO (1.0 mg mL−1) was spin-coated onto the active layer with a spin rate of 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a 100 nm Al cathode was thermally evaporated on top of the substrates under vacuum (<3.0 × 10−6 Pa). The J–V characteristics were measured on a Keithley 2400 source under the illumination of an AM 1.5G solar simulator with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2.
Synthesis of PS macroinitiator
In a round flask, 1-bromoethyl benzene (0.1 g, 0.54 mmol) was dissolved completely in p-xylene (7 mL), and styrene (5 mL, 4.36 mmol) was shortly passed through an aluminum oxide column to remove the inhibitor before use. Then, CuBr (0.0775 g, 0.54 mmol) and PMDETA (0.22 mL, 1.02 mmol) were added to the solution at room temperature under argon. Next, the reaction mixture was stirred at 110 °C for 4 h. After the reaction had completed, the polymer solution was precipitated into methanol and filtered off. Finally, the PS polymer was obtained under a vacuum. Mn = 8.6 kDa, PDI = 1.29. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 7.20 to 6.30 (br, Ar-H), 4.60 to 4.35 (br, –CH2Br), 2.10 to 1.60 (br, –CH2−), 1.50 to 1.30 (br, –CH−), 1.30 to 1.25 (br, –CH3).
Synthesis of PS-b-PPFS
In a round flask, the PS macroinitiator (0.1 g) was dissolved completely in p-xylene (7 mL), and PFS monomer (6.02 mL, 4.36 mmol), CuBr (0.0775 g, 0.54 mmol), PMDETA (0.22 mL, 1.02 mmol) were added to the solution at room temperature under argon. Then, the reaction mixture was stirred at 110 °C for 4 h. After the reaction had completed, the polymer solution was precipitated into methanol and filtered off. Finally, the PS-b-PPFS block copolymer was obtained under a vacuum. Mn = 40.7 kDa, PDI = 1.39. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3), δ (ppm): 7.20 to 6.30 (br, Ar-H), 2.25 to 1.70 (br, –CH2−), 1.50 to 1.20 (br, –CH−).
Synthesis of PPFS
In a round flask, PFS monomer (3 mL, 2.17 mmol) was passed through an aluminum oxide column to remove the inhibitor before use and was dissolved completely in p-xylene (5 mL). AIBN (0.089 g, 0.05 mmol) was added to the solution at room temperature under argon. Then, the reaction mixture was stirred at 110 °C for 4 h. After the reaction had completed, the polymer solution was precipitated into methanol and filtered off. Finally, the PPFS homopolymer was obtained under a vacuum. Mn = 5.2 kDa, PDI = 1.33. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3), δ (ppm): 2.75 to 2.15 (br, –CH2−), 2.10 to 1.70 (br, –CH−).
