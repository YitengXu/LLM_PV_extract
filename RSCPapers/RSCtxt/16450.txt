    , Accepted 7th November 2018First published on 15th November 2018AbstractHydrogen is a promising alternative renewable fuel for meeting the growing energy demands of the world. Over the past few decades, photoelectrochemical water splitting has been widely studied as a viable technology for the production of hydrogen utilizing solar energy. A solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of 10% is considered to be sufficient for practical applications. Amongst the wide class of semiconductors that have been studied for their application in solar water splitting, iron oxide (α-Fe2O3), or hematite, is one of the more promising candidate materials, with a theoretical STH efficiency of 15%. In this work, we show experimentally that by utilizing gold nanostructures that support gap-plasmon resonances together with a hematite layer, we can increase the water oxidation photocurrent by two times over that demonstrated by a bare hematite film at wavelengths above the hematite bandgap. Moreover, we achieve a six-fold increase in the oxidation photocurrent at near-infrared wavelengths, which is attributed to hot electron generation and decay in the gap-plasmon nanostructures. Theoretical simulations confirmed that the metamaterial geometry with gap plasmons that was used allows us to confine electromagnetic fields inside the hematite semiconductor and to enhance the surface photochemistry.
Introduction
The ever-increasing population of the world has resulted in a growing demand for energy sources. Due to declining fossil fuel reserves, the need for alternate renewable sources of energy has never been greater. In recent years, hydrogen has been proposed as an alternate fuel resource for the production of clean and efficient electric power. It is also a well-established fuel resource in industrial processes such as petroleum recovery and refining, ammonia synthesis, methanol production and metal fabrication, and is used in the electronics and food industries.1 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting utilizing solar energy and earth-abundant semiconductors is one of the most widely researched areas for hydrogen production.2 PEC water splitting dates back to the early 1970s and the pioneering work of Fujishima and Honda, who demonstrated overall water splitting using a PEC cell with a single crystalline TiO2 (rutile) anode and a Pt cathode under UV irradiation.3 Since then, there have been several studies carried out on water splitting that have reached acceptable limits of the solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency (such as an STH of 12.4% reported in 1998)4. Several recent articles have reviewed the advances in PEC solar water splitting reported to date.5,6
In order to achieve efficient water splitting, a semiconductor electrode has to satisfy some critical requirements. The semiconductor band gap should feature appropriate valence and conduction band positions relative to water redox potentials, and should demonstrate high light absorption, chemical stability and commercial viability. Electrochemical theory states that a material with a bandgap of 1.23 eV should be sufficient for PEC water splitting. However, due to potential losses and the kinetic overpotentials required to drive hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions in a PEC cell, the energy range for sustaining overall water splitting is generally reported to be 1.6–2.4 eV.5,7 A variety of semiconductor materials, such as TiO2, BiVO4, Cu2O, TaON and WO3 amongst others, have been investigated as candidate electrodes for PEC water splitting.8 Among these semiconductors, α-Fe2O3 (hematite) is one of the more extensively studied semiconductor materials for PEC water splitting. It is an earth-abundant, non-toxic and photochemically stable semiconductor. The progress made in PEC water splitting using hematite has been outlined in several review articles.9–11
Hematite has a band gap of 2.0–2.2 eV, which is ideally suited for PEC water splitting.12 The maximum solar energy conversion efficiency for hematite is 14–16%.13 However, the reported STH efficiency of hematite is very low, which is mainly due to the short excited state lifetime (<10 ps)14,15 and the short hole diffusion length of ∼2–4 nm.16,17 The majority of photoexcited electrons are lost in hematite through electron–hole recombination processes within the first few picoseconds, and only holes close to the semiconductor electrolyte interface contribute to the oxygen evolution reaction. Furthermore, hematite is an indirect bandgap material, and requires a relatively thick layer of active material for total solar absorption. This competes with the small hole diffusion lengths, which call for a thin active layer. The poor electrical conductivity of hematite also limits charge transport in the material.18 This can however be overcome by elemental doping. Reports of Si19 and Ti20 doping in hematite in order to increase the photocurrent of water oxidation can be found in the literature. These dopants can significantly increase the photocurrent and reduce the photocurrent onset potential. Si doping can result in photocurrents of around 2.2 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. Reference Hydrogen Electrode (RHE).21 Ti doping can cause a negative offset of 0.2 V of the onset photocurrent potential.22 The slow kinetics of water oxidation at the hematite surface is also a cause of the low solar conversion efficiency of hematite. Surface catalysts such as IrO2 can significantly enhance the photocurrent.23
One possible way to improve the oxidation photocurrent and address the trade-off between light absorption and hole diffusion length is to use resonant nanostructures to enhance the light collection efficiency of the active hematite layer. It was previously shown that optical Mie resonances and guided modes in a nanostructured hematite layer can increase the photocurrent by three times.24 Plasmonics – optics with metal nanostructures – can also be used to efficiently trap light inside the active layer for PEC water splitting. Several reviews have reported the progress made in plasmon-enhanced PEC water splitting.25–29 The field of plasmonics deals with the collective oscillation of free electrons in metals under light illumination.30 These collective oscillations, or plasmons, have wave-vectors much larger than free space light and can confine light or electromagnetic energy in sub-wavelength dimensions. Consequently, plasmons lead to high electromagnetic field density in nanoscale dimensions.31,32 The field of plasmonics thus allows us to tailor light collection and propagation at the nanoscale, and has been used to increase the photocurrent of hematite water oxidation. An increase of over an order of magnitude in the photocurrent demonstrated by hematite nanorods due to plasmon-induced light trapping from a gold nanohole array has recently been reported.33 Several other studies have also reported plasmon-enhanced photocatalytic water splitting with hematite.34–36
In this work, we report on plasmon-assisted oxidation photocurrent enhancement in ultrathin (10–20 nm) hematite films. Since hematite has a very low hole diffusion length, it is preferable to use thin films with enhanced absorption in order to harvest the maximum possible solar energy for water splitting. The enhancement reported in this work is due to plasmon resonances and optical scattering in a gold–hematite–gold sandwich structure. Here we report the design of a gold-based plasmonic hematite photoelectrode, which demonstrates an approximately two-fold increase and six-fold increase in the water oxidation photocurrent, above and below the hematite bandgap, respectively. The below-bandgap enhancement is believed to be due to the generation of hot electrons from plasmon decay. This technique has been widely reported to be useful in broadening the absorption spectrum of semiconductors for use in solar energy harvesting.
Material growth, characterization and fabrication
The hematite films were grown using Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD). Fig. 1a shows a detailed flowchart of the fabrication process. First, a 200 nm-thick gold layer was deposited on a Si(100) substrate with a 6 nm-thick Al2O3 adhesion layer. A 15 nm-thick layer of hematite was then deposited using a commercially available 99.9% pure Fe2O3 target. The hematite growth temperature was around 500 °C in a 30 m Torr O2 ambient, and the PLD had a 1.5–2 J cm−2 laser fluence. Gold nanodisks were fabricated on top of the hematite with e-beam lithography and lift-off using PMMA. The details of the fabrication process are provided in the ESI.†Fig. 1b shows a schematic of the fabricated sample that contained four arrays of gold nanostructures with various diameters and array periods. The structures support so-called gap-plasmon resonances, which are characterized by high field confinement in a dielectric/semiconductor sandwiched between the two metals (gold in this case). This gap geometry has been widely studied in the literature,37–40 and has also been used previously for photocatalytic enhancement.41 Here we use a gold gap-plasmon structure to enhance the light trapping and oxidation photocurrent in thin hematite films.

Raman analysis was used to identify the phase of hematite grown via PLD. Fig. 2a shows the Raman spectrum, which was collected using a DXR Raman spectroscope (Thermo Scientific, USA) with a laser at 633 nm. A total of eight vibration modes were detected in the hematite samples grown via PLD. The peaks, at 224, 242, 297, 408, 491 and 610 cm−1,42 correspond respectively to A1g(1), Eg(1), unresolved Eg(2)–Eg(3), Eg(4), A1g(2) and Eg(5) normal modes, which were predicted by factor group analysis for the crystal space group D3d6. We associate the peaks at 224, 242 and 297 cm−1 with the motion of iron cations, while those at 408, 491 and 610 cm−1 are associated with the motion of oxygen anions.43 In nanocrystalline hematite, a peak at ∼660 cm−1 is further detected, owing to the lack of long-range order. Due to structural disorder generated by the presence of lattice defects,44 small grain size45 or the incorporation of dopants,45–51 the Raman selection rules were relaxed. This allowed us to detect the IR-active Eu mode.

(b) High resolution TEM image of the hematite thin film on gold. The SAED (Selected Area Electron Diffraction) image is shown in the inset. The red box highlights the area chosen for SAED. The inter-plane distances between the (110) and (006) planes are also stated in the red box. 

Fig. 2b shows a High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) image of the sample. The inset of Fig. 2b shows the Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED) pattern for the hematite flake. Two crystal planes, namely (110) and (006), can be easily seen. The area chosen for SAED image collection is shown in red along with the lattice constants for the (110) and (006) planes. From analysing the Raman and TEM data, we can conclude that the PLD-grown hematite films were polycrystalline in nature.

Fig. 3a shows the SEM images of the fabricated gold nanodisks on hematite. Four different nanodisk diameters (D) and nanodisk pitch sizes (P) were utilized. These diameter–pitch (D–P) combinations were 100–200, 125–200, 150–300 and 200–300 in nanometers. All of the fabricated nanodisks showed a small amount of gold flakes, which is a common feature of e-beam lift-off with single layer PMMA. Removing the flakes requires the use of more complex bi-layer PMMA e-beam lithography, which was not used in the current fabrication. Fig. 3b shows the absorption spectra of all of the nanodisk arrays. Fig. 3b also shows the absorption measured for a bare hematite film on gold for comparison purposes. The two arrays with 100 nm and 125 nm nanodisk diameters and a 200 nm period show absorption peaks at wavelengths of 820 nm and 970 nm, respectively. These peaks correspond to the excitation of gap-plasmon resonances, as is evident from Fig. S3a in the ESI† obtained via simulation. The two arrays with disk diameters of 150 nm and 200 nm and a 300 nm period show absorption peaks at 1120 nm, for the former, and 730 nm and 1550 nm, for the latter. The peak at 1120 nm for the nanodisk with a 150 nm diameter and at 1550 nm for the 200 nm diameter nanodisk are gap-plasmon resonances. The absorption peak at 730 nm for the 200 nm diameter nanodisk is a higher order gap-plasmon resonance. This is easily verified in the electric field map plots obtained via simulation, as shown in Fig. S3b.†Fig. 3c shows the simulated absorption spectra for all of the nanodisk arrays. In all cases (experiment and simulation), the illumination was with p-polarized light at an angle of 20°. Simulations were carried out via a finite element method using the commercially available software, COMSOL. All of the gap-plasmon resonances demonstrate field confinement inside the hematite semiconductor. The observed and simulated gap-plasmon peaks follow the same trend; the plasmonic resonance wavelength increases with increasing disk diameter. This is typical for gap-plasmons.37 The simulations were carried out with the optical constants of hematite, as shown in Fig. S1b in the ESI.† The optical constants for the 15 nm-thin hematite film were obtained via Variable Angle Spectroscopic Ellipsometry. Some degree of numerical discrepancy between the measured and calculated wavelengths arises, we believe, due to possible uncertainties in the optical dielectric constants and thicknesses of the hematite and gold layers, since the hematite layer was deposited at a high temperature at which the underlying gold may not be stable. Therefore, the properties of gold could be modified, and, in addition, the gold-hematite top boundary may not be perfectly flat (Fig. S2†).

Results and discussion
The gap-plasmon electrode was tested in a three electrode PEC setup. The gap-plasmon electrode had all of the four different arrays of nanodisks described above, with each array being a 500 μm × 500 μm square. Furthermore, every array of a particular nanodisk diameter and pitch was replicated four times so as to give as large an area coverage as is possible to fabricate within a reasonable timeframe. A bare hematite film electrode was also measured for comparison purposes. The three-electrode PEC cell used a silver/silver chloride electrode (Ag/AgCl/Sat. KCl) as the reference electrode, and a high surface area Pt mesh as the counter electrode. The potential (E) referred to the RHE scaled through the Nernst equation: ERHE = EAgCl + 0.197 V + 0.059 pH(1)where EAgCl is the measured electrode potential vs. the reference electrode used and 0.197 is the reference electrode standard potential vs. RHE. In this manuscript, all measurements are reported with respect to the RHE. The measurements were carried out in 1 M NaOH aqueous solution at pH 13.6. Linear sweep voltammetry curves were measured at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. PEC measurements were carried out using a PGSTAT204 Autolab potentiostat. At least three electrodes of each type were fabricated and tested. All electrodes demonstrated similar characteristics. Fig. 4a shows the results of the measured photocurrent for the PEC cell. The red curve corresponds to the photocurrent measured for the gap-plasmon electrode whereas the black curve corresponds to the photocurrent measured for a bare hematite film on gold. The red dashed curve corresponds to the dark current, which is negligible. It can be seen that the gap-plasmon electrode exhibits about twice the photocurrent of that of the bare hematite film at 1.23 V vs. RHE. There is also a cathodic shift of approximately 0.4 V in the onset potential for the gap-plasmon electrode. This may be due to the catalytic effect of the gold nanodisks. We will discuss more on this later.

Above the hematite bandgap, the gap-plasmon electrode exhibits approximately twice the efficiency of the bare electrode. Below the bandgap, the increase in efficiency is up to six/seven-fold. The experimentally measured absorption plots for the four different arrays are also shown. We observe a complex, oscillating behavior for the EF in the IR spectral region where the plasmonic resonances are located. 

Fig. 4b shows the chopped photocurrent measurements performed at 1.5 V vs. RHE on the gap-plasmon (red curve) and bare hematite (black curve) electrodes. Once again, the gap-plasmon electrode exhibits twice the photocurrent in comparison with that of the bare film. The increase and decrease in photocurrent with the switching on and off of the incident light clearly demonstrates that solar-driven photocatalysis is the dominant response of both of the electrodes. That gold nanodisks have a catalytic influence on the photocurrent due to better charge separation in the space charge layer has already been reported in literature. This effect has been shown to contribute to the photocurrent on top of the plasmon-induced enhancement.52,53 We also attribute the cathodic shift of the onset potential for the gap-plasmon electrode to the catalytic effects of the gold nanodisk. However, to better understand the influence of this catalytic effect, we conducted Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) analysis on the gap-plasmon and bare film electrodes. The gap-plasmon electrode exhibited a 20% reduction in the charge transfer resistance in comparison with that of the bare film electrode. This means that the gap-plasmon electrode exhibits better separation of the generated charge carriers, which would lead to some increase in the measured photocurrent over that of the bare film electrode. Nevertheless, this increased charge separation capability does not sufficiently explain the doubling of the measured photocurrent for the gap-plasmon electrode, which we will discuss now.
To better understand the photocurrent enhancement for the gap-plasmon electrode, chronoamperometry measurements at 1.5 V of applied bias were carried out on both of the electrodes. Fig. 4c plots the Incident Photon Conversion Efficiency (IPCE), as obtained from these measurements. IPCE is calculated as (2)where Jmeas is the measured photocurrent at wavelength, λ, of incident intensity, I0. Looking at Fig. 4c, it can be clearly seen that the gap-plasmon electrode exhibits approximately double the efficiency of that of the bare hematite electrode, especially until 600 nm, i.e. above the hematite band gap. This may be due to off-resonant light scattering by the gold nanodisks and light reflection from the gold back-mirror. ESI Fig. S4† shows the maximum electric field amplitude enhancement inside the hematite film for each of the four different arrays of gold nanodisks compared to a bare hematite film as a function of the incident wavelength. It can be seen that the presence of the nanodisk arrays results in a higher electric field intensity inside the hematite at above-bandgap wavelengths, which may result in an increase in the photocurrent. The inset of Fig. 4c shows a zoomed-in version of the IPCE plot at visible (red)-to-infrared wavelengths. Fig. 4d shows the Enhancement Factor (EF) in the IPCE as a function of the wavelength. The Enhancement factor is calculated as (3)where IPCEGPE corresponds to the IPCE of the gap-plasmon electrode and IPCEBFE corresponds to the IPCE of the bare film electrode. At around a 1 μm wavelength, the gap-plasmon electrode exhibits a six-fold increase in the water oxidation photocurrent in comparison to that of the bare hematite electrode. This increase is believed to be due to plasmon decay and “hot” electron generation. As shown in Fig. 4d, the gap-plasmon resonator electrode supports plasmon modes at infrared wavelengths. These plasmons decay into “hot” electrons, which are non-equilibrium intraband excitations above the Fermi level in the conduction band of the metal. This also leaves “hot” holes in the corresponding valence band. These “hot” carriers thermalize due to electron–electron scattering (over fs timescales) followed by electron–phonon scattering (over ps timescales). These “hot” carriers can be harvested before thermalization when they cross the Schottky barrier at the semiconductor–metal interface and contribute to the electrochemical process, which in this case is water splitting. “Hot” electron generation and their dynamics have been extensively studied by the plasmonics community. Several review articles and research papers have reported theoretical and experimental studies on hot electron dynamics in plasmonic metals.54–61 An increase of over an order of magnitude in the photocurrent of TiO2 due to hot electrons has been reported in the literature.62 Other reports on hot electron induced photocurrent enhancement can also be found.63–66 It should be noted that hematite only supports oxygen evolution in a PEC cell that requires holes as the charge carriers. Recently it has been reported that Au nanoparticles are very suitable for hot hole generation.67 This is mainly due to the fact that transition metals (like Au or Cu) demonstrate hot carrier generation from the d-bands which sit approximately 2 eV below the Fermi level. Hence these metals produce more energetic hot holes than hot electrons and hence are more suited to drive OER.68 As Fig. 4d shows qualitative agreement between the plasmon absorption peaks of the different nanodisk arrays and the measured EF at near-IR wavelengths, we believe that in the sub-bandgap region of hematite we are witnessing plasmon generated hot hole induced enhanced photoactivity.
Conclusion
We demonstrated plasmon-assisted photocurrent enhancement in ultrathin hematite films. The hematite films were grown via pulsed laser deposition on a gold film on Si. A gap-plasmon based gold–hematite–gold structure was used in order to achieve the photocurrent enhancement. Our measurements show a two-fold increase in the photocurrent above the hematite bandgap, which is mainly attributed to the enhanced scattering by the gold nanodisks and back reflection from the gold mirror. Below the bandgap, we also observe a wavelength-dependent increase in the hematite photocurrent. This is attributed to plasmon decay and subsequent hot hole generation, which contributed to the photocurrent measured at near IR wavelengths. Our results provide a possible pathway to enhance the light trapping and photocatalytic response of ultrathin hematite films, thereby addressing the challenging trade-off of small carrier diffusion length and low light absorption. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a gap-plasmon based design has been used to achieve this effect experimentally in ultrathin hematite films. Improvement in hematite film growth by using different back metals such as Pt is believed to lead to a further increase in the oxidation photocurrent. The role of geometry in plasmon-induced hot carrier generation has already been elucidated and can be used to enhance the photocurrent response.68 Through the use of different plasmonic metals such as TiN,63 or using plasmonic nanostructures in the strong-coupling regime,69 or using different mechanisms such as direct hot electron injection,70,71 one should also be able to tailor the photocurrent response of these ultrathin hematite films. Finally, by utilizing the design of different plasmonic materials and/or nanostructure geometry and shape, it should also be possible to shift the plasmon resonance into the visible region above the hematite bandgap. This should lead to an even greater enhancement in the photocurrent due to increased interband excitation of the charge carriers.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Flowchart showing the fabrication steps for realizing the gold-hematite gap-plasmon electrode. (b) Schematic representation of a gap-plasmon array of different nanodisk diameters and periods on top of hematite-gold (blue-silicon, yellow-gold and red-hematite).	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Raman spectroscopy data for the hematite films grown on gold via pulsed laser deposition. The inset lists the positions of the Raman peaks in cm−1. (b) High resolution TEM image of the hematite thin film on gold. The SAED (Selected Area Electron Diffraction) image is shown in the inset. The red box highlights the area chosen for SAED. The inter-plane distances between the (110) and (006) planes are also stated in the red box.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) SEM images of the fabricated Au nanodisks for the gap-plasmon arrays with four different disk diameters (dia: diameter, per: period). (b) Experimentally measured absorption spectra, using p-polarized light at 20° incidence for all of the arrays. The measured absorption of the bare hematite film on gold is also shown. (c) Simulated absorption spectra, using p-polarized light at 20° incidence for all of the arrays. D: diameter of the nanodisk in nanometers and P: period of the array in nanometers.	 
ERHE = EAgCl + 0.197 V + 0.059 pH	(1)

 	Fig. 4  (a) Linear sweep voltammetry measurements with a 3 electrode PEC cell for gold-hematite gap-plasmon and bare hematite films (red curve: gap-plasmon, black: bare film, red dashed: dark current). (b) Chopped photocurrent measured at 1.5 V vs. RHE for the two samples. The photocurrent from the gap-plasmon resonators is almost 2 times that of the bare flat hematite electrode. (c) Incident Photon Conversion Efficiency (IPCE) for the gap-plasmon electrode and bare hematite electrode at 1.5 V of applied bias vs. RHE. Inset: IPCE at near-IR wavelengths (d) Enhancement Factor (EF) of the IPCE for the gap-plasmon electrode with all four nanostructure arrays and a bare film. Above the hematite bandgap, the gap-plasmon electrode exhibits approximately twice the efficiency of the bare electrode. Below the bandgap, the increase in efficiency is up to six/seven-fold. The experimentally measured absorption plots for the four different arrays are also shown. We observe a complex, oscillating behavior for the EF in the IR spectral region where the plasmonic resonances are located.
