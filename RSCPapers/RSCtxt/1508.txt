    , Accepted 27th April 2018First published on 27th April 2018AbstractAbsolute quantum efficiency (QE) of up-conversion (UC) materials is still limited to ∼3%, which strongly limits their applications in many areas. Herein, we report highly efficient UC β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ micro-cylinders prepared via a newly developed Li+/Na+ ion exchange method (IEM) with absolute QE as high as ∼4.0%. A small amount of Li+ is interstitially incorporated in β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+, which not only maintains well the micro-cylindrical morphology but also enhances the emission intensity by ∼40%, doubles absolute UCQE (∼3.0% under a fixed excitation power density of 15 W cm−2), and prolongs the lifetime. The UC excitation profile is composed of a sharp peak at 976 nm and a weak shoulder at 935 nm. The absolute UCQE of Li+/Na+ IEM β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ is systemically studied over a wide excitation power density of 0.4–100 W cm−2, and we obtained impressively high UCQE of 4.0% under 60 W cm−2 power density, which is among the highest values in the literature. The application of two green UC emissions of Li+/Na+ IEM β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ in ratiometric thermometers is successfully demonstrated. The high relative temperature sensitivity (SR) of 1113/T2 and excellent repeatability as indicated by three heating–cooling cycles (293–753 K) suggest their promising application as a temperature sensor.
Introduction
Up-conversion (UC) emission of lanthanide ions, which is realized through the conversion of multiple low energy photons into one high energy photon, has been widely investigated for applications in bio-medicine, optical labels, solar cell converters, lasers, waveguides, and anti-counterfeiting fields owing to its high signal-to-noise ratio, high sensitivity, and large anti-Stokes shift.1–10 Yb3+/Er3+-doped fluoride micro/nano-crystals, such as β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+, have been recognized as one of the most efficient UC materials due to their low phonon energy.11–17 To evaluate the emission efficiency of UC materials, absolute UC quantum efficiency (UCQE), which is defined as the ratio of emitted UC photons to the absorbed excitation photons, is rarely reported.18,19 For example, the theoretical maximum absolute UCQE of the two-photon emission of Yb3+/Er3+ is 50%, in which every two photons absorbed at 980 nm are used for emitting one visible photon (∼540/655 nm). However, owing to the nonlinear nature of UC emission, UCQE greatly depends on the excitation power density, and the reported absolute UCQE values, which are measured in different excitation power densities, are difficult to be compared with each other. Systematic studies on the excitation power density-dependent absolute UCQE are urgently required. Moreover, the reported highest absolute UCQE in β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ micro-crystals is only 2–3% with excitation power density in the range of ∼10–1000 W cm−2;20–22 such low UCQE greatly limits their applications in many areas, and the development of novel methods to increase UCQE is one of the urgent requirements in the field of UC materials.
For UC nanocrystals, many methods, such as the one using designed core–shell architecture and plasmon effect, are widely used to enhance UCQE.23–26 However, to enhance the UCQE of micro-crystals, the applicability of these methods is limited.19 Recently, the UC efficiency of lanthanide-doped β-NaYF4 micro-crystals has been greatly improved via our newly developed hydrothermal ion-exchange modification (IEM) method.7,8,27,28 The IEM method is a very promising method to synthesis UC fluoride materials with high UCQE and controlled morphology. For example, our recently reported IEM method has already realized β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+, which has comparable efficiency with that of the materials prepared by the traditional high-temperature solid-state method, and the absolute UCQE reached ∼3% for IEM β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ under 10 W cm−2 power density and 980 nm laser excitation.7,8 Furthermore, in previously reported studies, co-doping of a small amount of inert ions has been frequently used to modify the local structure of lanthanides and to improve the UCQE of lanthanide-doped micro/nano-crystals.29,30 For instance, via co-doping of a small amount of Li+ in β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+, the UC emission intensities of green and red emissions can be enhanced by 47 and 23 times, respectively.30 Co-doping of a small amount of Li+ in Y2O3:Yb3+,Er3+ also realized 25 times enhancement in the UC emission intensity.31 Consequently, higher UCQE is expected for β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ by the combination of two methods via co-doping of small amount of Li+ during the IEM process.
In this study, a small amount of Li+ is co-doped into β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ micro-cylinders synthesized via a newly developed Li+/Na+ ion exchange method (IEM) using γ-YF3 as a precursor. Li+ is evidenced to be interstitially doped in β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ with well-maintained micro-cylindrical morphology. The absolute UCQE of β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ micro-crystals is systematically studied under various excitation power densities from 0.4 to 100 W cm−2. Impressively, the highest UCQE of as high as 4.0% with only 60 W cm−2 power density is obtained, which is among the highest values in literature. The application of two green UC emissions as temperature sensors is demonstrated. The excellent repeatability in three heating–cooling cycles and high relative temperature sensitivity (SR) of 1113/T2 indicate their applications in temperature sensing.
Experimental
Chemicals and materials
Yb(NO3)3·5H2O, Er(NO3)3·5H2O, Y(NO3)3·6H2O, LiF, NaF, and NH4HF2, all with 99.99% purity, were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation and used without further purification.
Precursor crystal synthesis
γ-YF3:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+ precursor crystals (PC) were synthesized with the hydrothermal method. First, a lanthanide (Ln) aqueous solution composed of 1560 μL 0.5 M Y(NO3)3, 2000 μL 0.1 M Yb(NO3)3, 400 μL 0.05 M Er(NO3)3, and 1040 μL deionized water was prepared. Then, 0.1680 g NaF (NaF/Ln = 4) was dissolved in 15 mL deionized water, which was added to the Ln aqueous solution, and the solution was vigorously stirred for 15 minutes. The mixed solution was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon bottle held in a stainless steel autoclave, sealed, and maintained at 180 °C for 3 hours. When the obtained precipitates were cooled to 25 °C, they were separated, washed by centrifugation with deionized water and ethanol, and dried at 80 °C for 12 h.
Ion-exchange modification (IEM)
PC of γ-YF3:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+ (0.0932 g), NaF (0.1342 g), and NH4HF2 (0.3645 g) with 1.2 mL deionized water were stirred for 10 minutes in a 25 mL Teflon bottle held in a stainless steel autoclave. Then, the autoclave was sealed and maintained at 250 °C for 5 h. When the obtained precipitates were cooled to 25 °C, they were separated, washed by centrifugation with ethanol and deionized water, and dried at 80 °C for 12 h. To modify the local symmetry and increase the UC emission intensity of β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+, Li+ was doped in β-NaYF4 by partly replacing NaF by LiF. The ratio of (LiF + NaF) to YF3 was 5, and the molar ratios of LiF to NaF were 0/100, 20/80, 40/60, 60/40, 80/20, and 82/18. The synthesized samples containing LiF were washed with dilute hydrochloric acid (0.6 M) to remove unreacted LiF impurities.
Characterization
A Rigaku Ultima IV (Japan) X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα1 radiation) was used to obtain the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples. The morphology and composition of the samples were measured on a Hitachi SU8010 (Japan) scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). By dissolving the micro-crystals in a mixed solution containing equal volumes of hydrochloric acid and nitric acid, their composition was also determined by a Thermo iCAP 6300 radial view inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). An Edinburgh Instruments FLSP 920 system (England) equipped with 976 nm laser diode (LD) and a visible photomultiplier (PMT) detector was used for measuring UC emission spectra and decay curves. UC excitation spectrum was measured by scanning the laser wavelength from 900 to 1000 nm with a step of 2 nm and a fixed excitation power density of 3 W cm−2. The light source was a wavelength tunable laser using Ti:Sapphire as a gain medium (Matisse 2, MOS-3 Optics set). The absolute UCQE was measured in an integrating sphere.18 The ηIQE values were determined by four individual measurements using eqn (1): (1)Here,  and  are the integrated PL intensities with and without the sample, and  and  are the integrated intensities of excitation light without and with the sample in the sphere, respectively.32–34 The power density of LD was tuned by a rotatable neutral density filter. For temperature-dependent UC emission spectra (293–833 K), the samples were mounted under a vacuum atmosphere on a thermal stage (HCP622, Instec, Germany) and excited by 976 nm LD with a power density of 2 W cm−2.
Results and discussion
Structure and morphology of Li+/Na+ IEM β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+

Fig. 1a–c show the XRD patterns of Li+/Na+ IEM β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ as a function of LiF/NaF ratios (0/100, 20/80, 40/60, 60/40, 80/20, and 82/18). For the samples synthesized with the LiF/NaF ratios ≤80/20, the crystal structure can be well-indexed to that of pure β-NaYF4 (space group: P63/m (176), PDF#16-0334), whereas for the sample synthesized with the LiF/NaF ratio = 82/18, a strong phase separation and high ratio of scheelite-like tetragonal LiYF4 (space group: I41/a (88), PDF#85-0549) can be observed. When NaF is in excess, i.e., with NaF/YF3 ≥ 1 (LiF/NaF ≤ 80/20), YF3 prefers to react with NaF to form single β-NaYF4 phase. When NaF is insufficient, i.e., with NaF/YF3 = 0.9 (LiF/NaF = 82/20), YF3 reacts with both NaF and LiF to form both β-NaYF4 and LiYF4, leading to a strong phase separation.

Interestingly, all diffraction peaks of β-NaYF4 gradually shift to a lower angle with an increase in the LiF/NaF ratio. As an example, the peak of the (100) reflection gradually shifts to lower angle with an increase in the LiF/NaF ratio from 17.18° (LiF/NaF = 0/100) to 17.14° (LiF/NaF = 82/18), as shown in Fig. 1b. A similar phenomenon can also be observed for other diffraction peaks, as exemplarily shown in Fig. 1c. According to the well-known Bragg's law, this result indicates expansion of the unit cell of the β-NaYF4 crystal. There are two possibilities by which Li+ can enter the β-NaYF4 crystal lattice: displacing (i) Na+ lattice sites or (ii) interstitial sites. The ionic radius of Li+ (76 pm, in an octahedral environment) is ∼25% smaller than that of Na+ (102 pm, in an octahedral environment), resulting in very low solubility of Li+ in the Na+ sites.35 Thus, the displacement of Na+ lattice sites by Li+ ions leads to the shrinkage of the unit cell of the β-NaYF4 crystal and the shift of the diffraction peaks to higher angles, which is not supported by XRD. On the contrary, when Li+ interstitially enters β-NaYF4 lattice, it results in the expansion of the unit cell of β-NaYF4 and the movement of the diffraction peaks to lower angles, which is fully supported by XRD. Consequently, we believe that Li+ ions interstitially enter the β-NaYF4 lattice, which leads to the expansion of the unit cell of β-NaYF4 and benefits the UC emission (which will be discussed later).
The appearance of a small amount of Li+ in the β-NaYF4 phase is verified by ICP-OES analyses of Li+/Na+ IEM β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+ (LiF/NaF = 40/60), as summarized in Table 1. The atomic ratio of Y:Yb:Er is determined to be 78.1:19.3:2.6, which is similar to the nominal composition of 78:20:2. The atomic ratio of Li:Na is 98.6:1.4, which confirms the appearance of small amount of Li+ in the β-NaYF4 crystal. The Li+ concentration is far below the concentration in the designed LiF/NaF ratio, hinting that most of LiF does not react with YF3, and only a small amount of Li+ enters the β-NaYF4 lattice in the interstitial sites.

Fig. 1d–f show SEM images of Li+/Na+ IEM β-Li/NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ samples synthesized with various ratios of LiF/NaF = 0/100, 40/60, and 82/18, respectively. The LiF-free sample (LiF/NaF = 0/100) shows a cylinder-like morphology with a typical length of ∼3.8 μm and a diameter of ∼2.3 μm. Its surface is coarse with many shallow holes, which may be due to the absence of a chelating agent during the synthesis. The sample with LiF/NaF ratio of 40/60 well preserves the morphology and size of the LiF/NaF = 0/100 sample, due to their same crystal phases, as indicated by XRD. However, the morphology and size of the LiF/NaF = 82/18 sample present a big change compared with those of the LiF-free sample, which may be due to the aforementioned strong phase separation; its morphology is spherical-like with a size of 1.5–2.5 μm. Fig. 1g–l illustrate the EDS elemental mappings of Li+/Na+ IEM β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+ (LiF/NaF = 40/60). As the content of Li is beyond the detection limit of the EDS method, no Li signal can be found. The homogenous distributions of F, Na, Y, Yb, and Er elements in Li+/Na+ IEM β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+ is proved by EDS mapping.
Enhanced UC emission via Li+/Na+ IEM
The excitation spectrum for UC emission materials has been rarely reported in the literature due to the nonlinear nature of UC and the difficulty to maintain constant laser excitation power density. However, the excitation spectrum is vital for choosing the optimum pumping source, e.g., wavelength and width. Thus, we have developed a home-built optical system to measure UC excitation spectrum by scanning the laser wavelength from 900 to 1000 nm with a step of 2 nm and a fixed excitation power density of 3 W cm−2. Fig. 2a presents the corresponding UC excitation spectrum of Li+/Na+ IEM β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+ (LiF/NaF = 40/60) by monitoring the Er3+ emission at 539 nm. The excitation profile is composed of a sharp peak at 976 nm and weak shoulder at ∼935 nm, which are due to the electron transitions of Yb3+ from the ground state of 2F7/2 to the excited state of 2F5/2. Thus, we select the 976 nm LD as the excitation source.
 Fig. 2  Enhanced UC emission in Li+/Na+ IEM β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+. (a) UC excitation spectrum by monitoring Er3+ emission at 539 nm with a power density of 3 W cm−2. (b) UC emission spectra, (c) normalized UC emission spectra, and (d) integrated emission intensity and intensity ratio of green to red for Li+/Na+ ion-exchanged β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+ depending on the LiF/NaF ratios (0/100, 20/80, 40/60, 60/40, 80/20, and 82/18). The excitation source is 976 nm LD with a power density of 3 W cm−2. (e) Double logarithmic plot of pump power density (976 nm, 0.73–4.28 W cm−2)-dependence of green (peaked at 539 nm) and red (peaked at 654 nm) UC emission band intensities for Li+/Na+ IEM β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+ synthesized with LiF/NaF = 40/60 and their corresponding linear fitting curves of the experimental data. (f) The decay curves for 539 nm UC emission of IEM crystals synthesized with various LiF/NaF ratios (0/100, 20/80, 40/60, 60/40, 80/20, and 82/18). 

Fig. 2b shows the corresponding UC emission spectra of Li+/Na+ IEM β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+ as a function of LiF/NaF ratios (0/100, 20/80, 40/60, 60/40, 80/20, and 82/18) with an excitation power density of 3 W cm−2. Typical UC emission dual bands of Er3+ at green and red regions with the maxima at ∼521/539 and 654 nm, respectively, can be observed; they are readily ascribed to the Er3+ transitions of 2H11/2/4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2, respectively. The UC emission intensities of Er3+ in green and red yield comparable intensities with an intensity ratio of green-to-red, IGreen/IRed, of ≈1. When LiF/NaF < 82/18, the intensity ratio of green-to-red, IGreen/IRed, (≈1) only slightly changes with the LiF/NaF ratio (see Fig. 2c and d). A larger ratio of IGreen/IRed ≈ 1.3 can be observed for the LiF/NaF = 82/18 sample due to strong phase separation. A bright green output color can be observed for all samples owing to the weak sensitivity of human eyes in the deep red spectral region. The corresponding CIE-1931 chromaticity color coordinate is determined to be (0.30, 0.69), which is close to those of the pure green region. As shown in Fig. 2d, the UC emission intensity of all bands increases with an increase in the LiF/NaF ratio up to 40/60. The LiF/NaF = 40/60 sample exhibits ∼40% enhancement in the UC emission intensity with respect to the LiF-free sample. As demonstrated in the inset of Fig. 2b (under irradiation of 3 W cm−2 from the 976 nm LD), the UC intensity of the LiF/NaF = 40/60 sample is much brighter than that of the LiF-free sample. The higher LiF/NaF molar ratio (>40/60) leads to the decrease in the UC emission intensity.

Fig. 2e shows the double logarithmic dependence of UC emission intensities of green (539 nm) and red (654 nm) bands on the pump power density (0.7–4.3 W cm−2) for Li+/Na+ IEM β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+ with LiF/NaF = 40/60. UC emission is a nonlinear process, and the involved photon number, n, can be estimated by the slope via linear fitting of the double logarithmic relationship of the UC emission intensity of a given band versus the excitation power density in the low excitation power density region. For the green band, at the low excitation power density region (0.7–2.1 W cm−2), the slope of 1.90 ± 0.06 can be determined, which indicates the nature of two-photon UC process. For the red band, the slope of 2.47 ± 0.08 can be observed at the low excitation power density region (0.7–2.1 W cm−2), which indicates the combination of two- and three-photon process. At a higher power density region (2.5–4.3 W cm−2), the slopes of green and red bands decrease to 1.20 ± 0.06 and 1.57 ± 0.07, respectively, which is due to laser-induced heating with high excitation power density.

Fig. 2f shows the decay curves of Li+/Na+ IEM β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+ as a function of LiF/NaF ratios (0/100, 20/80, 40/60, 60/40, 80/20, and 82/18). The decay profile is composed of a short rise and a long decay process. The appearance of the short rise process confirms the energy transfer UC mechanism. The rise time (i.e., time to the maximum intensity) decreases from ∼240 to 150 μs with an increase in the LiF/NaF ratio. The decay lifetime (τ1/e) increases from 439 to 606 μs with an increase in the LiF/NaF ratio up to 60/40. The higher LiF/NaF ratio >60/40 shortens τ1/e from 606 to 551 μs. Furthermore, the dependence of the decay curves on excitation power density for green UC (539 nm) is measured, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The lifetime of the green emission (539 nm) remains almost constant with different pump power densities.
The incorporation of a small amount of Li+ in β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+ in the interstitial sites distorts the local symmetric environment of Yb3+/Er3+, as indicated by the XRD results in Fig. 1a–c. The 4f–4f transitions of trivalent lanthanides (Ln3+) are parity-forbidden. The transition strength of Ln3+ is directly linked to the crystal structure symmetry around Ln3+. The distortion of the local symmetric environment of Yb3+/Er3+ due to Li+ incorporation into the interstitial sites leads to enhanced absorption strength and radiative emission rates, resulting in an overall enhancement of UC emission intensity and UCQE, as is proven by other reports that have used similar co-doping method.29–31,36,37 Thus, strongly enhanced UC emission intensity and prolonged lifetime can be observed via Li+ co-doping in IEM β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+.
UC is a nonlinear process, which means that the absolute UCQE strongly depends on the excitation power density, and high excitation power density (below the saturation value) results in high UCQE value. However, the absolute UCQE value has been rarely reported even at a fixed power density due to technical difficulty. We developed a home-built optical system to measure UCQE, which is dependent on the excitation power density. Only UC emissions in green and red regions were considered for the UCQE calculations. We first measured the absolute UCQE values of Li+/Na+ IEM β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+ with LiF/NaF = 0/100 and 40/60 at a fixed power density of 15 W cm−2. The UCQE value of the LiF/NaF = 40/60 sample was determined to be 3.0%, which was around two times higher than that of the LiF-free sample. This result further confirmed the improved UC performance of β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ prepared by Li+/Na+ ion exchange. We further measured excitation power density-dependent absolute UCQE (over a wide range of 0.4–100 W cm−2) for Li+/Na+ IEM β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+ (LiF/NaF = 40/60), as illustrated in Fig. 3. As expected, the UCQE value strongly increased with an increase in the excitation power density from 0.2% (0.4 W cm−2) to 4.0% (60 W cm−2). The UCQE value (4.0%) is among the highest values in the literature (2–3%), as shown in Table 2.12,20–22 A plateau could be observed for a higher power density (60–100 W cm−2) due to the saturation effect and laser-induced thermal heating. The UCQE values for the single green and red bands were determined to be 1.7% and 2.3%, respectively.

Upon excitation with 980 nm LD, electrons of Yb3+ ions are excited from the ground state of 2F7/2 to the excited state of 2F5/2. Two sequential energy transfers from Yb3+ to Er3+ sequentially populate Er3+: 4I11/2 and Er3+: 4F7/2 levels.30 The following non-radiative relaxations populate the green UC emitting levels of 2H11/2 and 4S3/2. There are four routes to populate the red UC emitting level of 4F9/2: (i) back energy transfer (BET) from Er3+ to Yb3+via Er3+: 4S3/2 + Yb3+: 2F7/2 → Er3+: 4I13/2 + Yb3+: 2F5/2, followed by energy transfer from Yb3+ to Er3+via Er3+: 4I13/2 + Yb3+: 2F5/2 → Er3+: 4F9/2 + Yb3+: 2F7/2; (ii) the radiative emission process via Er3+: 4S3/2 → 4I13/2, followed by energy transfer from Yb3+ to Er3+via Er3+: 4I13/2 + Yb3+: 2F5/2 → Er3+: 4F9/2 + Yb3+: 2F7/2; (iii) the non-radiative relaxation from 4I11/2 to 4I13/2, followed by energy transfer from Yb3+ to Er3+, and (iv) the non-radiative relaxation from 4S3/2 to 4F9/2. The large energy gaps of 4I11/2/4I13/2 (3600 cm−1) and 4S3/2/4F9/2 (3600 cm−1) make the routes (iii and iv) less possible. Thus, we think that the BET process from Er3+ to Yb3+ is the main route to obtain red UC for Li+/Na+ IEM β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+. The BET process from Yb3+ to Er3+ is widely reported in Yb3+/Er3+ co-doping system to achieve red UC emission of Er3+;38,39 it is caused due to the very close distance between Yb3+ and Er3+ with high doping concentrations of Yb3+ and Er3+, but the radiative emission via Er3+: 4S3/2 → 4I13/2 may also happen. In consideration of the high Yb3+ doping concentration (20 mol%) used in our study, the non-radiative BET process is more dominative.

Repeatability of UC ratiometric thermometry
The energy gap between Er3+: 2H11/2 and Er3+: 4S3/2 levels is ∼800 cm−1. The fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) of two green emissions from the thermally coupled levels (TCLs) of Er3+: 2H11/2 and Er3+: 4S3/2 is highly suitable for ratiometric thermometers.
Thus, Yb3+/Er3+-co-doped UC materials have been frequently reported as good candidates for ratiometric thermometers.40–42 In the present study, we investigate the temperature-dependent UC emission properties of Li+/Na+ IEM β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+ for their potential applications in ratiometric thermometers. Fig. 5 shows the UC emission spectra of Li+/Na+ IEM β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+ (LiF/NaF = 40/60) as a function of temperature from 293 to 753 K with a step of 10 K (293–393) and 20 K (393–753 K). As expected, the emission intensities of 2H11/2 (defined as G1) and 2S3/2 (defined as G2) levels yield different behaviors with temperature. The emission intensity of G2 sharply decreases with an increase in the temperature from 293 to 753 K. At 753 K, the emission intensity is only 6.5%, and it is as strong as that at 293 K. However, the emission intensity of G1 only slightly changes with temperature, and it slightly increases from 293 to 353 K and then slowly decreases with temperature from 353 to 753 K. At 753 K, it is still as strong as that at 293 K. Consequently, the different changing behavior of UC emission intensity results in a gradual increase in the intensity ratio of G1/G2 from 0.25 (293 K) to 1.9 (753 K) with temperature. The monotonous change in the intensity ratio allows the applications of UC materials in thermometers.

The variation of (e) absolute temperature sensitivity (SA) and (f) relative temperature sensitivity (SR) as a function of temperature. Lines in (c, e and f) are the guide for the eyes. 
The variation in the FIR of two TCLs obeys Boltzmann distribution and can be described by the following eqn (2):43 (2)Here, I2, I1, C, ΔE21, kB, and T represent the emission intensity of upper and lower levels, temperature-independent constant, the energy gap of TCLs, Boltzmann constant (kB = 0.69503 cm−1 K−1), and absolute temperature, respectively. ΔE21 can be calculated by the exponential fitting eqn (1). The energy gap between 4I11/2 and 2S3/2 levels is calculated to be ∼772 cm−1 by the linear fitting of the intensity ratio using the equation of C × exp(−ΔE/kB/T), and this value is in accordance with the literature values.44–47
The absolute temperature sensitivity SA can be calculated viaeqn (3): (3)However, SA is system-dependent. Thus, relative sensitivity, SR, is frequently reported for fair comparison among different thermometric material systems and can be calculated viaeqn (4). (4)SA gradually increases from 2.5 to 3.9 × 10−3 K−1 with an increase in the temperature from 293 to 503 K and then, it slightly decreases from 3.9 to 3.4 × 10−3 with an increase in the temperature from 503 to 753 K. The small change in absolute sensitivity (2.5–3.9 × 10−3 K−1) allows their ratiometric thermometer application over a wide temperature range of 293–753 K. The application in a low-temperature range (below room temperature) is also expected, but it was limited by the measuring facility in our lab. The application in a high-temperature range >753 K is also limited due to the thermal decomposition of β-NaYF4 at higher temperature.48SR is determined to be ∼1113/T2, and the maximum value is 1.3% K−1 at 293 K, which decreases from 1.3 to 0.2% with an increase in the temperature from 293 to 753 K. Thus, a larger value is expected with lower temperature (<293 K). The SA and SR values of Li+/Na+ IEM β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+ (LiF/NaF = 40/60) are very similar to the reported values for Yb3+/Er3+-co-doped UC materials in literature, as summarized in Table 3.

Repeatability is vital for real applications. Thus, we measured the repeatability of FIR (G1/G2) over three heating and cooling cycles between 293 and 753 K, as illustrated in Fig. 6. The FIR showed excellent repeatability, which guaranteed their applications in thermometers over a wide temperature range of 293–753 K.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we report highly efficient up-conversion emission of β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ micro-cylinders prepared via a newly developed Li+/Na+ ion exchange method by using γ-YF3:Yb3+,Er3+ nanocrystals as a precursor. Li+ enters a β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ crystal via an interstitial pathway. Co-doping of a small amount Li+ in β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ not only maintains well the micro-cylindrical morphology but also results in enhanced emission intensity (∼40%) and prolonged lifetime. UCQE of the Li+/Na+ IEM sample (3.0%) is around two times bigger than that of the Li+-free sample under excitation of a fixed excitation power density of 15 W cm−2. Power-dependent UCQE of the Li+/Na+ IEM sample is investigated over a wide power density range of 0.4–100 W cm−2. Impressively, the highest UCQE value is as high as 4.0% with 60 W cm−2 power density, and it is among the highest values in literature. The application of two green UC emissions as temperature sensors is demonstrated. Also, excellent repeatability in three heating–cooling cycles and high relative temperature sensitivity (SR) of 1113/T2 hint their applications in temperature sensing.
