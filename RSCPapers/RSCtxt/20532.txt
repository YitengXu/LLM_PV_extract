    , Accepted 16th June 2013First published on 5th July 2013AbstractThe stability of fully printed flexible organic electrochromics based on 11 different conjugated polymers is explored from the fundamental chemical degradation level to the operational device level. The photochemical stability of the electrochromic polymers (ECPs) is studied enabling an analysis of the influence that the chemical constitution of the conjugated polymer backbone has on the photochemical stability. Based on changes in the UV-visible absorption and IR spectra, the polymers were categorized into two distinct groups, each with a separate degradation mechanism. During irradiation (1000 W m−2, AM 1.5G) under ambient conditions the majority of the polymers degraded within 4–5 hours. Three polymers showed increased stability with degradation rates from 0.44 to 1.58% per hour measured as loss of absorption. Application of oxygen and UV barrier foils was found to drastically slow the photochemical decomposition of the polymer films, such that after 2200 hours of continuous irradiation the less stable polymer films were degraded 27% on average, while the degradation of the most stable polymer films was immeasurable thus indicating that such materials can be sufficiently stable for device operations for many years under indoor conditions and for a few years under outside conditions. Finally, functioning electrochromic devices (ECDs) were made and the effect of illumination on the response time and optical contrast was established. This report shows that encapsulated electrochromic devices based on flexible barrier substrates exhibit increased stability and are indeed viable in devices such as shading elements, light management systems, displays with low switching speed requirements and signage.
Introduction
Electrochromic conjugated polymers have for several decades been promising candidates for a variety of optical devices such as billboard displays, matrix displays, e-paper and light management devices such as “smart” windows, sun glasses and other forms of shading elements.1 As fundamental studies on synthesis, colour control, etc. have progressed during this time,1–8 research towards commercial exploitation of ECPs and development of ECDs should now be regarded as the next step in advancing this technology beyond academic interest. Following this line of thought large area EC displays are suitable candidates for introducing electrochromics on a commercial basis. To be commercially attractive emerging technologies that are meant to replace existing ones already in the market face several challenges to be competitive. New technologies must show improvements on parameters such as cost, efficiency, production speed, environmental impact, etc. In that context we believe that electrochromic polymers have potential since they have low power consumption, show a multitude of vibrant colours and can be processed on flexible substrates using fast processes and abundant elements. The latter is a prerequisite for keeping the production costs low. We have previously reported on the development of processing ECPs on flexible substrates integrated in an organic photovoltaic driven circuit, large area ITO free displays and patterning of electrochromic films, as we see the efficient processing of ECPs on flexible substrates as central in realizing the potential of ECPs.9,10 In this respect, stability of the polymer films is a key element.
The basic principle of an electrochromic device is the ability to change colour by application of a suitable electric potential (shown in Fig. 1) that will oxidize the polymer films if the electrode potential is higher (more positive) than the equilibrium potential of the cell or reduce/neutralize the film if the electrode potential is lower (more negative). The working principle governs the architecture which subsequently affects the stability of ECDs: Since redox reactions occur in the polymer films they need to be in contact with the electrodes, and so the ECPs are coated onto separate transparent conductive substrates (usually flexible substrates or glass coated with ITO). For electrical insulation and ion storage an electrolyte layer is sandwiched between the polymer coated electrodes, which are put (facing inwards) on top of each other. Though other ECD approaches using conjugated polymers are being investigated, multilayer structures such as that shown in Fig. 1b are currently used in a majority of ECDs.11–13
 Fig. 1  Working principle and architecture of an ECD. (a) Two ECPs are coated on electrodes connected to an external power source. For electrical insulation and ion storage, an electrolyte layer is sandwiched between the two polymers. By application of a suitable potential ECP 1 is oxidized at the anode and ECP 2 is reduced/neutralized at the cathode. Due to the electric field created between the two electrodes anions and cations move towards the anode and the cathode respectively, where they are injected into the polymer film thereby doping the polymer and compensating for the developing charge (i.e. formation of polarons and bipolarons). (b) The working principle governs the architecture of ECDs. The layer structure presented here is encountered in a majority of devices. The ECPs are coated onto electrode substrates facing inwards with an electrolyte layer sandwiched in between. 
The mechanical stability of a polymeric ECD has two weak points, the electrolyte layer and the conductive substrate. Liquid electrolytes are difficult to process and the resulting ECDs need to be meticulously sealed to prevent leakage. To circumvent this, the electrolyte needs to be in the form of a gel or solid.14 Using a solid electrolyte compromises the switching time, which is dependent on the ionic mobility. This drops as a function of increased electrolyte viscosity. By using an ionic liquid/PMMA based polymeric gel, we have previously shown that the electrolyte layer can be efficiently deposited onto a polymeric layer using slot die or spray coating, with response time in the order of seconds.9 Transparent electrodes are vital to ECDs, and because no better alternative exists, so far indium doped tin oxide (ITO) has been widely used as an electrode material. This can be problematic in large area devices since ITO presents a large sheet resistance. A large sheet resistance can cause an ohmic drop across the substrate, with uneven switching and higher potential near the external contacts as a result.15,16 Furthermore, the mechanical stability (i.e. risk of cracking and scratching) of the ITO layers can be low, and from a commercial perspective the cost of ITO is high, owing to the scarcity of indium, and the embedded energy associated with sputter deposition.17 Since electrochromic polymers are to be electrically switched between redox states, newly developed ECPs customarily have their redox properties evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV).1,3,18 CV is also the basis for evaluation of electrochemical stability along with spectroelectrochemistry and measurement of long-term optical contrast (ΔT). From an electrochemical stability perspective the valence band and conduction band are of significance, as they give an electrochemical window in which to operate. Outside of this the polymers are prone to electrochemical degradation by irreversible electrochemical oxidation or reduction. Polymers with relatively high HOMOs are easily oxidized and as a result “doped” with anions (p-doping) from the electrolyte layer. A high HOMO level is advantageous when operating an ECD, as a low potential is sufficient to drive the device between the two redox states.
The combination of oxygen, moisture and light is known to be the reason for photochemical breakdown of polymers at large.19,20 By analysing poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) in oxygen saturated solutions, Holdcroft found a linear relationship between irradiation time and decrease in optical density, which was seen as an indication of a reduced number of conjugated π-electrons.21 The absorbance maximum was also slightly shifted, and this was attributed to a decrease in the average conjugation length. Oxygen, solvent and irradiation wavelength were identified as the three main components responsible for photodegradation. Further studies identified photobleaching and photolytic chain scission as two separate mechanisms of photodegradation in solution.22 It was concluded that singlet oxygen was responsible for the majority of photo bleaching, by ring opening of the thienyl residue through a 1,4-Diels–Alder addition. A free radical pathway of chain scission was proposed, in which residual transition metal salts from the polymerization reactions (mainly Fe3+) were photolysed to radicals. These were believed to initiate proton abstraction from the alkyl side chain, leading to addition of ground state oxygen and subsequently chain scission through multiple pathways. In thin polymer films of P3HT photo bleaching has also been observed, but instead of chain scission, network formation by crosslinking of the alkoxy radicals produced was identified.23,24 Recently the involvement of singlet oxygen in the degradation of P3HT films has been rejected by Manceau et al. and a mechanism proposed wherein photobleaching is attributed to oxidation of the alkyl side chains, while oxidation of the thiophene backbone is believed to cause chain scission and loss of conjugation.25–27 Both pathways involve radical chain mechanisms where the α-protons on the side chains play a significant role in the degradation, and the observation that decreasing the irradiation wavelength will increase the photooxidation supports this.28 Other studies propose that the polymer is mainly attacked at the terminal thiophene rings and at points of broken conjugation.29,30 A rule of thumb for the photochemical stability of a large range of donor–acceptor polymers was recently published and herein alkyl side chains, quaternary sites and C–N/C–O bonds were identified as leading to poor photochemical stability while aromatic polycyclic units stabilized the polymers.31 The position of the HOMO was also addressed, but the conclusion on this matter was less clear.
The aspect of photochemical stability has been largely ignored for ECPs and the literature is scarce. This can to a large extent be attributed to the fact that so far, photochemical stability has not been the limiting factor for the stability of ECDs. In this report we evaluate the photochemical stability of ECPs. We first establish a rate of degradation based on chemical motifs and thicknesses of the polymer films. Then we analyse ECDs by successively adding layers such as electrolyte, barrier film, etc. to establish their effect on the photochemical stability. Finally we examine the effect that irradiation has on the response time of an ECD and evaluate the photochemical stability of a fully operating electrochromic device. We do this by exposing the targeted ECPs and ECDs to artificial solar irradiation (AM 1.5) in a custom made degradation setup that allows for fast and reliable analysis. This is correlated with infrared (IR) spectroscopy of the polymer films at various stages of degradation.
Experimental
Instrumentation

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a BRÜKER 250 or 500 MHz FT-NMR. IR spectroscopy was performed on a Spectrum One from Perkin-Elmer. Transmission/absorption IR spectra of the polymer films were obtained from ECPs spin-cast onto KBr pellets from toluene solutions. Absorption/transmission profiles in the 800–300 nm range were determined using a Pharma Spec UV-1700 from Shimadzu. The film thickness was measured on a Dektak 3030 from Veeco Instruments Inc. scanning 500 μm with a stylus force of 0.05 mN.
Film formation
ECP films were spin-coated from 20 mg mL−1 solutions of toluene or chlorobenzene (ECP 5 and ECP 6). The ECP 2 solution additionally contained 6 mg mL−1 AIBN and 2 drops per millilitre ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA, 1 drop ∼ 21 mg). Films were cast onto ITO-coated glass (2.5 cm × 5 cm; Rs ∼ 20 ohms per sq) or onto ITO covered PET foil (2.5 cm × 5 cm; Rs ∼ 30 ohms per sq) at angular velocities of 500–1400 rpm using a Laurell WS-400-6NPP spin-coater.
Film degradation
A fully automated, high-throughput photo-chemical degradation setup was used for the degradation of all materials in this study as described elsewhere.32 The setup utilizes a Steuernagel solar simulator with an Osram 1200 W metal halide arc lamp providing an approximate AM1.5G spectrum with an intensity of 1000 W m−2. The sample exchanger has a capacity of 22 samples and a UV-vis spectroscopic probe based on an optical fiber-based CCD spectrometer (Avantes AvaSpec 1024) and a halogen/deuterium light source (Avantes AvaLight-DHc) were used to measure the evolution in the absorbance of the samples.
Long term stability measurements
Samples were constructed by spincoating ECPs onto ITO coated PET and sealing them by covering the substrate on both sides with a PET multilayer foil comprising a PTA adhesive (3M, MP467, cut-off 320 nm) that functioned as an oxygen barrier foil.
Half the sample was further covered with a UV barrier foil (Amcor, thickness 72 μm, cut-off 400 nm), see Fig. 3B and C. A second set of samples were constructed that in addition contained a PMMA based electrolyte previously employed in ECDs,9 see Fig. 3D and E. Samples were irradiated for 2200 hours using a solar simulator as described above. Absorption spectra were measured at weekly intervals, relative to an appropriate reference that was similarly exposed. It should be noted that blisters in the protective foil (following 500 hours of illumination) might cause reflections different from the reference.
Response time
Functional electrochromic devices were constructed by spincoating ECP 1 and ECP 9 onto ITO/PET substrates (1.5 cm × 3 cm; Rs ∼ 80 ohms per sq) as previously reported.9 Prior to assembly, the ECP 1 coated substrates were irradiated (AM 1.5G, 1000 W m−2) for 0, 30, 60 and 90 minutes respectively. Potential square wave absorptiometry experiments were done from −0.6 V to +1.5 V with a 60 second hold at each of the two potentials. After an initial “break in” of 35 double switches, the response time was obtained.
Results and discussion
The polymers presented in this study are depicted in Fig. 2, and were synthesized in our laboratories for this report according to the literature.32–41 Polymer structures were confirmed by NMR and IR spectroscopy. The selected polymers are all solution processable from common organic solvents, as a prerequisite for efficient film formation. Polymers encompassing several colours were chosen, since a wide range of colours are used in commercial billboards, signs, displays, etc.

On this basis it is of interest to know the rate of degradation of the individual polymer films, when designing such displays. And although colour mixing by subtractive primary colours (red-blue-yellow) or cyan-magenta-yellow produces the full colour spectrum, it has yet to be sufficiently demonstrated in functioning ECDs.36 Furthermore polymers encompassing different chemical motifs were synthesized, to study the effect of these on the photochemical stability. ECP 1 and ECP 9 are both magenta coloured in the neutral state. ECP 1 has been extensively studied over the last decade, and in addition to being a homopolymer with distinct characteristics, it also serves as a point of reference since the structure is part of several of the copolymers explored.35 The crosslinkable analogue ECP 9 is capable of network formation, and the effect of this on the photochemical stability was observed.41ECP 3 is a random copolymer, with a structure that gives rise to several absorption peaks within the visible spectrum. The result is a black colour which is of interest in relation to e-paper, shading and black/white displays.37ECP 4 and ECP 5 are both blue in their neutral state but comprise different chemical motifs.30,42 The blue colour in ECP 4 is a result of the donor–acceptor approach, with ProDOT(OEtHx)2 and benzothiadiazole as the donor moiety and acceptor moiety respectively.8 The steric effect of the phenyl ring in ECP 6 is another approach by which to alter absorption of ECPs. By a combination of steric and acceptor properties the absorption is blueshifted and therefore ECP 6 appears yellow in the neutral state.36 Polymer ECP 7 is orange in the neutral state and has a higher band gap than ECP 8 that has methoxysubstituted thiophenes randomly incorporated. These substituents relax the steric repulsion between the substituents and lower the band gap to 2.0 eV, which redshift the absorption to 525 nm producing a red polymer.31ECP 10 is green in the neutral state and was selected based on the different chemical motif compared to the other polymers.43ECP 11 is green as well and encompasses a BTD acceptor group that results in an additional absorption peak compared to ECP 5, typical of donor–acceptor polymers.8,39ECP 2 is an almost colourless polymer in both redox states, which is advantageous in ECDs, where it can function as a charge balancing polymer with minimal effect on the optical contrast.38 The effect of the structural difference of ECP 2 and the other polymers (polypyrrole vs. polythiophenes), and the near absence of absorption in the visible spectrum was explored.
Photochemical degradation of ECPs
To determine the rate of degradation of the ECPs, the polymer films were subjected to solar irradiation under different conditions, as depicted in Fig. 3. In order to correlate film thickness with absorption, ECPs were spin coated on ITO covered glass at different angular velocities. Following this, a thickness dependent rate of photochemical degradation was established by illuminating the samples while recording the absorption spectra, as detailed in the Experimental section. Fig. 4a shows the absorption spectra recorded during continuous irradiation of ECP 1. During this time (0–5 h) a pronounced decrease in absorbance is observed in the visible region, while a slight increase in absorbance is seen in the ultraviolet region. The latter is caused by degradation products absorbing in that part of the spectrum. Due to the position of the HOMO, oxidation of the polymer under ambient conditions might influence the degradation. To ensure that the polymer was in its fully natural state, the polymer film was switched between the two redox states (+1.5 V/−1.0 V) leaving it in the neutral state prior to irradiation. As there was no observable difference in the absorption spectra following this treatment, it was considered an unnecessary source of experimental error. Fig. 4b shows the maximum absorbance (absmax) as a function of illumination time for three different polymers along with the fitted curves. The slope of these curves is the degradation rate given as the percentage decrease of absmax per hour. For similar information on the other polymers the reader is directed to the ESI (Fig. S1–S11† – b graphs, note the difference in time scale for various polymers).

The comparison of degradation rates for different polymers can be challenging and reports have shown an order of magnitude difference in the degradation of P3HT.29,44,45 The explanation for this discrepancy is that the film thickness influences the observed degradation rate, and in addition the comparison of degradation rate for different polymers of equal thickness is questionable since the extinction coefficient can be vastly different. Using the absorption maximum has been suggested as a better alternative. For this reason all degradation experiments were conducted with a series of thicknesses for each polymer. Fig. S1–S11† (d graphs) in the ESI show the correlation between thickness and absorption. It is noted that it was not possible to obtain the exact same thicknesses for all polymers. However, initial absorption values as close to 0.5 as possible have been used for comparing the degradation rate of the polymers in this report. Consistent with previous findings, degradation rates cannot be determined on scales better than a factor of five for comparison of different polymers.32 This, however, still allows us to organize the polymers in a hierarchy based on their relative degradation rates. This is shown in Table 1. ECP 11, the most photo stable polymer, is more stable than ECP 8, the most photo unstable polymer, by a factor of 200. The degradation behaviour of the different polymers clearly divides them into distinct degradation classes, see Fig. 4 and ESI.† Some polymers exhibit a linear decline of absorption during degradation (ECP 1–4, 10 and 11) while others exhibit a sublinear decline (ECP 5–8). Based on these observations, the polymers can be classified into two groups according to their photochemical stability and degradation modes. Group 1 includes all polymers with linear degradation behaviour. Group 2 includes all polymers with sublinear degradation behaviour. In Table 1 the group assignment is indicated in column 4. From this point it is clear that all polymers in group 1 are more photochemically stable than the polymers in group 2. The grouping of the polymers is indicative of the underlying degradation mechanism governing the degradation of the polymers. Linear degradation behaviour as exhibited by group 1 can be explained by a simple hypothesis. If one imagines that the polymers of this group only degrade by a mechanism attacking terminal positions on the polymer chain, the degradation would be linear since the number of reaction sites is constant, as seen for group 1. On the other hand if there is no preferred attack point on the polymer the degradation rate would decelerate since the number of reaction sites diminishes, as seen for group 2. A mixed state where the polymer is preferably degraded at terminal positions, but also at intermediate points would result in an accelerating degradation behaviour which is not observed for any of the groups, this does however depend on the respective rates of the two degradation mechanisms. The terminal attack point hypothesis infers that the conjugation must be preserved for the majority of the degradation period; that is the absorption peak position must remain near constant for the major part of the degradation. When plotting the peak position as a function of the degradation state, as can be seen in the ESI for all polymers, a peak shift rate can be established (Fig. S1–S11,†c graphs). As is evident from Table 1 all polymers in group 1 exhibit a slower peak shift than the polymers in group 2; an observation consistent with the terminal attack point hypothesis. We have already established that if the polymer is attacked at terminal positions the degradation would be linear, but if the polymer is attacked at completely random positions we can also predict the shape of the degradation. If it is assumed that the degradation is not oxygen limited or limited by light shielding, the only rate-determining factor is the number of attack points.30 The rate will be given by the recurrence equation f(n + 1) = (1 − a)f(n), where n represents the numbered time intervals and a is the percentage loss of attack points per time iteration. The solution to this equation can be written in the form f(n) = c(1 − a)n. By letting f(1) = 100 and then optimizing to the degradation state values this function can be fitted to the experimental data. In Fig. 4 a fit for ECP 8 along with the experimental values is depicted. It is found that all polymers in group 2 can be described with an r-squared value better than R2 = 0.98. This is a very strong indication that the degradation mechanism is indeed targeting random positions on the polymer chain. The fact that a faster peakshift is observed for this group also strengthens the hypothesis, since the conjugation length would change faster in the random attack mode.

From the data in Table 1, it is seen that the two most photochemically stable polymers ECP 11 and ECP 4 contain a benzothiadiazole (BTD) group. There are, respectively, 80 and 14 times increase in photochemical stability between these two copolymers and the homopolymers ECP 1 and ECP 5 that have similar chemical motifs but do not comprise BTD groups. Being an electron-deficient group, the incorporation of the BTD group is expected to lower the oxidation potential of the polymer, due to a relatively lower lying HOMO level of the resulting polymer.45,46 While the electrochemical stability of conjugated polymers depends on the electrode potentials (and consequently HOMO/LUMO levels),47 the photon energy from sunlight is so high that other reactions such as radical initiated side-chain scission contribute to the degradation of conjugated polymers. The third most photo-stable polymer was the thienopyrazine ECP 10, which is in good accordance with previously published results.31,48 The position of the HOMO is not necessarily correlated with photochemical stability, but in this case the effect is observable. Looking at Table 1, one can note the difference in stability between the magenta coloured polymers ECP 1 and ECP 9. The increased stability of ECP 9 is attributed to the methacrylate functionalities present in the polymer. When crosslinked, ECP 9 shows a two fold increase in stability (see footnote a in Table 1) compared to ECP 1, which is presumably due to absorption of photons by the carbonyl group formed by crosslinking. In the absence of a photoinitiator and crosslinker in the polymer film (see footnote c in Table 1), ECP 9 shows a fourfold increase in stability compared to ECP 1. This increase was ascribed to a higher degree of photon absorption by the methacrylate group compared to the carbonyl moiety in the crosslinked species.
Infrared spectroscopy
As UV-visible absorbance spectroscopy is based on π–π* transitions and related features such as charge transfer, conjugation length and regioregularity of the polymer films, infrared spectroscopy was used to monitor the chemical alterations of functional groups and correlate with the results obtained using UV-visible spectroscopy. Fig. 4c shows the assignment of the major peaks in the infrared spectrum of ECP 1. Since all, but one, of the polymers are polythiophenes with similar structural components, they show analogous infrared spectral features. For the assignments of the other polymer films the reader is directed to the individual spectra in the ESI (Fig. S1–S11,† e graphs). The peaks from 2960 cm−1 to 2860 cm−1 are assigned to C–H stretching mainly from the aliphatic side chains. The intensity of these peaks progressively decreased during irradiation as a result of photolytic scission of the aliphatic side chains. The peaks from 1500 cm−1 to 1434 cm−1 are assigned to symmetric and asymmetric CC stretching in the thiophene rings. These signals disappear during exposure which is ascribed to changes in the ring structure and conjugation. The decrease in the intensity of these peaks was found in accordance with the UV-visible absorption spectra. The peaks at 1100 cm−1 to 1050 cm−1 likewise decreased during irradiation of the film. These peaks are assigned to the C–O–C stretch from the ether groups. During exposure two bands appeared in the carbonyl region at 1764 cm−1 and 1634 cm−1. The appearance and increase in these peaks is a strong indication of CO formation. The intensity of the former band increased up to a certain point whereafter it decreased slowly. This band has, under similar conditions, previously been assigned to anhydride species. The latter band can be assigned to an aromatic ketone that is photochemically unstable, which is in accordance with the disappearance of this band on continuous irradiation. A broad band centred at 1150 cm−1 also appeared during exposure, which previously has been assigned to sulphur–oxygen oxidation products such as sulfinic acids or esters i.e. a breakdown/opening of the thiophene ring.26 In the hydroxyl region a broad signal between 3200 and 3700 cm−1 increased during progressive irradiation. The appearance of bands in this region indicates formation of hydroxyl or peroxy adducts.
The infrared spectrum obtained from the polypyrrole ECP 11 was similar to those of the polythiophenes with minor differences. The peaks at 1462 and 1373 cm−1 are assigned to CC stretching in the pyrrole ring. The peak at 1434 cm−1 corresponds to a C–N stretching vibration and the peaks 1163 and 1139 cm−1 are assigned to C–O–C stretching from the ether bindings. All of the above peaks decreased in intensity during irradiation. A peak appeared in the carbonyl region at 1723 cm−1 during irradiation, and increased continuously until a slight drop was observed after 10 hours of exposure. Fig. 5 shows the (normalized) development in the intensity of various bands in the infrared spectrum of ECP 1 as a function of irradiation time along with the absorption at 545 nm. The signals corresponding to aliphatic side chains (2964 cm−1) and the thiophene ring (1464 cm−1) decrease in intensity at the same rate, while the visible absorbance at 545 nm decreased at a rate four times as fast during the first 5 hours, whereafter the curve reached a minimum. As visible absorbance requires a minimum conjugation length to be detectable, this explains why the IR signals from the thiophene ring are detectable long after 5 hours. For the carbonyl signal at 1734 cm−1, the trend is the opposite. The signals increase during the first eleven hours, whereafter the intensity slightly decreases, suggesting formation of a carbonyl containing oxidation product that subsequently decomposes. The occurrence and development of the signals during irradiation show trends much alike those obtained for P3HT, which implies that the ECPs degrade via similar intermediates.26

Operational stability
In addition to the diminished absorbance due to photochemical alterations of the polymer films, the operational characteristics, response time and optical contrast, of a photo exposed ECD were obtained. To confine the effect of irradiation to the primary ECP film (the more strongly coloured ECP),1 these were illuminated prior to device assembly, as detailed in the Experimental section. Electrochemical stability was ensured by keeping the applied potentials at −0.6 V to +1.5 V, which is fairly low for an electrochromic device. The low potentials naturally compromised the response time and optical contrast of the devices, but as focus was on changes in response time due to illumination (relative to a non-exposed device), the extended response time was of no concern. Fig. 6a shows the optical contrast (ΔT) and response time of photo exposed ECDs potentiostatically switched between −0.6 V and +1.5 V. As seen in the figure, illumination affected both redox states of the device, with a pronounced effect on the coloured state of the devices. After 30 minutes of exposure the minimum transmission (Tmin) obtainable increased from 45% (non-exposed) to 47% (30 min), 62% (60 min) and following 90 minutes of irradiation Tmin was 73%. Exposing the samples to irradiation had a less pronounced effect on the bleached state, since photodegradation involves oxidation of the film. The difference in maximum transmission (Tmax) between the non-exposed and the film exposed for 90 minutes was only 3%. As a consequence, ΔT decreased from 35% in the non-exposed device to 33% (30 min), 17% (60 min) and 6% (90 min). The absence of plateaus, due to incomplete oxidation reactions, on the oxidized parts of transmission curves is noted. A further increase in transmission should therefore be possible, but as shown in Fig. 6b the slope of the current response only very slowly approaches zero during the end of the 60 second potential step, indicative of a very slow electrochemical reaction at this stage. Extending the potential step to three minutes merely resulted in a minor transmission increase (results not shown), and the 60 second potential steps were considered reasonable for measuring changes in response time. In Table 2 the response times for the ECDs are shown. Since a substantial part of the redox reaction occurs at the beginning of the voltage pulse (as seen by the initial current spike in Fig. 6b), the changes in response time due to exposure for 90% and 95% of a full switch are expected to be most notable. Going from left to right in the “coloured to bleached” columns, a slight decrease in response time is observed between the non-exposed sample and the one exposed for 30 min. We suggest this being caused by the larger optical contrast of the non-exposed sample. The opposite (i.e. increased response time) seen for films exposed for 60 and 90 minutes is attributed to widespread degradation of the polymer chains, not yet occurring in the 30 min. exposed film. It is also worth noting that although the difference in response time between e.g. the non- and 90 minute exposed samples at 95% of a full switch is negligible, the optical contrast of the former is roughly six times as large as the latter; hence more chemical reactions occur during the same time interval. The response time when reducing the polymers was, as expected, faster compared to the corresponding oxidation reactions. Such discrepancy in response time is common for p-dopable electrochromic polymers and could be explained by a lower reduction potential relative to the oxidation potential, and secondly charge balancing anions are intercalated in the solid polymer films upon oxidation, while exiting into a semisolid electrolyte upon reduction. On extending the exposure time of the samples, a generally slower response time when reducing the devices is observed. As the illuminated polymer films contain oxidized functional groups, these may impede delocalization of pi-electrons and formation of polarons. In conclusion the response time in both directions is affected by illumination. Even though the response time is faster when reducing the polymer films, this reaction is slowed relatively more by light exposure than the corresponding oxidation reaction.

The “coloured to bleached” and “bleached to coloured” columns show the response time when oxidizing (+1.5 V) and reducing (−0.6 V), respectively, ECP films irradiated for 0, 30, 60 and 90 minutes. For every film the response time for a 100% (full) switch is given along with the response time for a 90%, 95% and 98% switch.

Long term stability
The relatively poor stability of the ECP films under ambient conditions is incompatible with ECDs that are supposed to function for long periods of time. For ECDs that operate indoors under artificial illumination, this degradation is negligible, but for ECDs operating outside (e.g. ECDs driven by a photovoltaic cell or an outdoor electrochromic display) the lifetime of the ECDs has to be long to be useful. It is realized that operational ECDs will have a multi-layered structure, different from Fig. 3A, which will confer some degree of protection to the ECP films. But even with an optimistic prediction of a magnitude increase in lifetime gained from the layered structure, the lifetime of the ECDs is still too short. By employing barrier foils capable of protecting the ECP films from atmospheric oxygen and/or UV irradiation (see Fig. 3B–E), this was addressed. The barrier foils were applied directly onto the ECP samples, and as the foils are equally flexible, this was done without compromising the flexibility of the samples. The oxygen barrier comprised a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) multi-layered foil and a pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) that facilitated encapsulation of the sample. As the encapsulation was done under ambient conditions, small amounts of oxygen were intrinsically trapped inside the samples, but the effects of this were considered limited.
After 2200 hours of continuous illumination the average level degradation for group 1 polymers was so limited that it was immeasurable, while the group 2 polymers showed a degradation rate of 0.027% per hour on average. This amounts to a drastic 1300–3300 fold increase in lifetime for group 2 polymers. To observe the effect of the PMMA electrolyte, a second set of samples comprising the electrolyte gel were investigated (see Fig. 3D and E).49 The PMMA based gel did in some instances confer additional protection from photochemical degradation, and did in any instance not enhance degradation.
The UV barrier foil did not seem to have any direct effect on the stability of the ECPs, as the oxygen already conferred UV protection, but the additional UV barrier did protect the oxygen barrier from UV induced decomposition, thereby extending device lifetime.
Conclusions and outlook
In this report we have established that the majority of electrochromic polymers tested degraded within 1–5 hours of irradiation in an ambient atmosphere. Based on the degradation profile, the polymers can be grouped into two distinct groups, each with a separate mechanism. The mechanisms are based on fitted models, which were shown to match the experimental data very well. In one mechanism the polymer chains are attacked at terminal positions only and this leads to a linear loss of absorption. In the second mechanism the polymer chains are attacked at random positions during irradiation, with a logarithmic decrease in the degradation rate as a consequence. The relatively photo unstable ECPs were protected with oxygen and/or UV barrier foils, which prolonged the lifetime of the polymers. With a yearly average of 2.8 sun peak hours per day at northern latitudes (e.g. Copenhagen) and 4.9 sun peak hours at subtropical latitudes (e.g. Miami), 2200 hours of illumination (AM 1.5G, 1000 W m−2) amount to exposure for more than two years at northern latitudes and a year and a half for southern latitudes. These numbers show that photochemically stable ECDs with convincing operational lifetimes can be constructed by a relatively simple process. This facile manner of protection is encouraging for the further development and use of electrochromic polymers in devices, and by increasing the barrier foil stability (e.g. using thicker foils) a further increase in lifetime can be expected. By analysing operational performance of exposed polymer films it was found that both response time and optical contrast were compromised.
In a broader context, this is to the best of our knowledge the first published research paper that thoroughly analyses the photochemical stability of conjugated electrochromic polymers. As stability issues are very important, they need to be addressed as part of the on-going development of operational electrochromic devices. Continuing the work on stability issues would further enhance development within the area of electrochromic devices. Research on electrochemically stable electrodes and electrolyte materials is strongly needed, alongside the improvement of robust manufacturing processes.

 	Fig. 1  Working principle and architecture of an ECD. (a) Two ECPs are coated on electrodes connected to an external power source. For electrical insulation and ion storage, an electrolyte layer is sandwiched between the two polymers. By application of a suitable potential ECP 1 is oxidized at the anode and ECP 2 is reduced/neutralized at the cathode. Due to the electric field created between the two electrodes anions and cations move towards the anode and the cathode respectively, where they are injected into the polymer film thereby doping the polymer and compensating for the developing charge (i.e. formation of polarons and bipolarons). (b) The working principle governs the architecture of ECDs. The layer structure presented here is encountered in a majority of devices. The ECPs are coated onto electrode substrates facing inwards with an electrolyte layer sandwiched in between.
