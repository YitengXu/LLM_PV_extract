    , Accepted 4th October 2019First published on 5th October 2019AbstractAs a light absorbing material of perovskite solar cells, Mn-doped CsPbI2Br has a better phase stability than the undoped one. In order to deeply understand the doping mechanism of Mn, the effect of substitutional and interstitial Mn doping on the structural, electronic and optical properties of CsPbI2Br has been investigated by first-principles calculations based on density functional theory. It is found that the binding energy of both the substitutional and the interstitial Mn-doped CsPbI2Br is negative and the binding energy difference between them is only 2.8 meV, which indicates that both the substitutional and the interstitial doping structures should be stable for Mn-doped CsPbI2Br and the latter is slightly preferred over the former due to the lower binding energy. The lattice parameters of CsPbI2Br change oppositely for two Mn-doping cases. Based on the comparative analysis of the electronic structures for CsPbI2Br and Mn-doped CsPbI2Br, we found that the substitutional doping of Mn introduces intermediate bands near the Fermi level, making CsPbI2Br an intermediate band semiconductor; for the interstitial Mn-doped CsPbI2Br the Fermi level enters conduction bands, making it an n-type semiconductor material with enhanced conductivity. The complex dielectric function and the absorption spectrum of Mn-doped and undoped CsPbI2Br were calculated and are basically consistent with the experimental results.
1 Introduction
Nowadays, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has reached 24.02%.1–4 But their long-term stability is poor. The thermally unstable and inherently volatile nature of certain organic components remains the biggest obstacle to commercialization. The use of inorganic components instead of organic ones may be an ultimate solution to the thermal instability problem.5,6
Recently, purely inorganic cesium lead halide perovskites (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br and I) have received great attention due to their good charge carrier mobility and high thermal stability, and the cubic (α)-CsPbI3 with a band gap of 1.73 eV is the most suitable one for photovoltaic application. However, the α-CsPbI3 phase is unstable at room temperature or in a wet atmosphere, and it can transform rapidly into a non-perovskite orthorhombic (δ) phase with a poor photovoltaic performance.7 It is found that α-CsPbI2Br shows an increased Goldschmidt tolerance factor and improved stability by partially replacing I− ions with Br− ions in α-CsPbI3.8 In 2016, Snaith et al.9 demonstrated that the all-inorganic perovskite CsPbI2Br can stably present in the cubic phase at room temperature with a conversion efficiency of 9.8%. Recently, the conversion efficiency of CsPbI2Br solar cells has increased to 16.07%.10
Although the device stability of inorganic CsPbI2Br PSCs is better than that of the hybrid ones, their PCEs are lower than those of the latter ones. Typically, they exhibit relatively low open circuit voltages (Voc) and short-circuit current densities, which are primarily due to non-radiative recombination losses at the internal and interface contacts of the bulk perovskite film.11,12 In order to further improve the phase stability of cubic CsPbI2Br and the device performance, many experimental studies on the doped CsPbI2Br have been carried out, such as replacing Cs+ with K+,13 replacing Pb2+ with Sr2+,14 Eu2+,15 Ge2+16 or Zn2+17 and In3+ and Cl− co-doping18 in CsPbI2Br. In addition, the Mn element is also widely doped into CsPbX3 perovskites19–22 and some studies have reported the crystal structures, thermal stability and optical properties of Mn2+ doped CsPbX323,24 by substituting Pb2+with Mn2+. Interestingly, Bai et al.25 have recently found that Mn2+ ions insert into the CsPbI2Br lattice interstices during the film growth, leading to the reduction of recombination loss and the improvement of hole extraction efficiency. The optimal device efficiency of CsPbI2Br solar cells using the interstitial Mn-doped CsPbI2Br film reached a record efficiency of 13.47% in 2018. It seems that both the substitutional and the interstitial doping structures are probable to exist for Mn-doped CsPbI2Br in experiments depending on the film growth process. The influence of different Mn doping models on the stability, structural, electronic and optical properties of CsPbI2Br, however, is still far from clear.
In order to deeply understand the mechanism of Mn doping and provide valuable guidance for energy band engineering and preparation of stable CsPbI2Br perovskites, systematic first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) have been performed to comparatively investigate the phase stability, lattice structures, electronic and optical properties of the undoped, substitutional and interstitial Mn-doped CsPbI2Br. The first-principles calculation has been proved to be an accurate and powerful tool for theoretically studying the various physical and chemical properties of matters in the condensed state and also has been well applied to study the formation energies, bond lengths and electronic properties of the substitutional Mn-doped CsPbX3.23,24
2 Computational methods and models
All calculations were performed with the framework of DFT by using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)26 code with a plane-wave basis set. Both the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional and the more complex Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof hybrid functional (HSE06)27 have been used to calculate the electronic structure of CsPbI2Br. Due to a well-balanced compromise between accuracy and computational efficiency, the GGA-PBE functional, which has been proved to be reliable enough for the qualitative prediction of electronic structures, has been employed in this work to describe the exchange and correlation energy (see Fig. S1, ESI†). The atomic pseudopotential was described by the projector augmented wave method (PAW). The electronic configurations of Cs, Pb, I, Br and Mn atoms are [Xe]6s1, [Xe]5d106s26p2, [Kr]4d105s25p5, [Ar]3d104s24p5 and [Ar]3d54s2, respectively. The plane-wave cutoff energy was 600 eV. The grid of k-points employed for computing integrals over the Brillouin zone for geometry optimizations and density of states calculations was taken as 5 × 5 × 5 and 10 × 10 × 10, respectively.
According to the direct transition definition and Krames–Kronig dispersion relation, the real and imaginary parts of the complex dielectric function28ε(ω) = ε1(ω) + iε2(ω) of a crystal can be expressed as follows: (1) (2)in which M stands for the dipole matrix, i and j represent the initial and final states respectively, fi and Ei are the Fermi distribution function and the electron energy of the ith states, respectively, and P is the main value of the integral. The optical properties such as absorption coefficient α(ω) can be calculated as follows once the real and imaginary parts of the complex dielectric function are obtained, (3)
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Lattice structures and thermodynamic stability of Mn-doped CsPbI2Br
As shown in Fig. 1(a), CsPbI3 has a cubic crystal structure at room temperature with a space group of Pmm (No. 221) and its primitive cell consists of 1 Cs, 1 Pb and 3 I atoms. The lattice constants of CsPbI3 from experiments are a = b = c = 6.289 Å, α = β = γ = 90°.29 In this work, the optimized lattice constants of CsPbI3 from first-principles calculations are 6.408 Å, which agree well with the theoretical result from others (6.394 Å),30 indicating that the parameters and models we used are reasonable. The lattice model of CsPbI2Br was further built by replacing one I atom with one Br atom based on the optimized CsPbI3 lattice model, (see Fig. 1(b)).
 Fig. 1  Lattice models of CsPbI3 (a) and CsPbI2Br (b). 
The optimized lattice constants of the CsPbI2Br unit cell are a = b = c = 6.297 Å. In comparison with the lattice constants of CsPbI3, there is lattice shrinkage in CsPbI2Br since the radius of the Br atom is smaller than that of the I atom. In a 2 × 2 × 2 CsPbI2Br supercell consisting of 40 atoms in total, when one of the Pb atoms is substituted by an Mn atom, the corresponding doping concentration is 12.5% and the lattice parameters decrease from 12.595 Å to 12.392 Å for the substitutional Mn-doped CsPbI2Br model with the lowest total energy (see Table S1, ESI†). The lattice shrinkage is due to the smaller radius of the Mn atom in comparison with that of the Pb atom.19 When the Mn atom occupies one of the octahedral interstices in the supercell, the corresponding doping concentration is 2.5% and the lattice parameters increase to 12.619 Å. It should be noted that the Mn atom in octahedral interstices is more stable than in tetrahedral interstices from the point of view of the total energy. Hence, only the octahedral interstices of the CsPbI2Br supercell were considered for the interstitial Mn-doping (see Table S2, ESI†). The most stable lattice models of the substitutional and interstitial Mn-doped CsPbI2Br are shown in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 2  Lattice models for Mn-doped CsPbI2Br: substitutional doping (a) and interstitial doping (b). 
As shown in Fig. 3, the PbI4Br2 and MnI4Br2 octahedra in the undoped and substitutional Mn-doped CsPbI2Br models as well as the nearest neighbouring PbI4Br2 octahedron around the Mn occupied octahedral interstice in the interstitial Mn-doped CsPbI2Br were observed and their bond lengths and angles were determined and compared in Table 1, in order to study the effect of Mn-doping on the local lattice structure of CsPbI2Br. From Fig. 3(a) and (c), it can be seen that the nearest neighbouring PbI4Br2 octahedron around the Mn atom in the interstitial Mn-doped CsPbI2Br deforms markedly compared with the PbI4Br2 octahedron in the undoped CsPbI2Br, which can be quantitatively proved by comparing the bond lengths and angles shown in Table 1. In addition, it is interesting to note that the volume of the octahedral interstice for storing the Mn atom shrinks slightly while the volume of the nearest neighbouring PbI4Br2 octahedron around the Mn atom expands, which may be the reason for the increase of the lattice parameters in the interstitial Mn-doped CsPbI2Br model. From Table 1, it is also found that the bond lengths of the MnI4Br2 octahedron are shorter than those of the PbI4Br2 one and the bond angles remain the same before and after the substitutional Mn-doping.

In order to evaluate the thermodynamic stability of Mn-doped CsPbI2Br, the binding energy,31 which is defined as the energy difference between the total energy of the doped system and its constituent atoms, was employed: (4)in which Eb is the binding energy, Etot is the total energy of Mn-doped CsPbI2Br; EAatom is the energy of the free atom i (i = Cs, Pb, I, Br, and Mn), and ni represents the number of atom i in the supercell. The binding energy for the substitutional and interstitial Mn-doped CsPbI2Br supercells was calculated to be −2.5761 eV per atom and −2.5789 eV per atom, respectively (see Tables S1 and S2, ESI†). The negative binding energies and the slight binding energy difference of 2.8 meV indicate that both doping structures are stable, which can be employed to understand the fact that both the substitutional and the interstitial Mn-doped CsPbI2Br have been prepared in experiments.20,22,25 It seems that the interstitial Mn-doped CsPbI2Br is slightly more preferred due to its lower binding energy.
3.2 Electronic properties of Mn-doped CsPbI2Br
As shown in Fig. 4(a), both the conduction band minimum (CBM) and the valence band maximum (VBM) of the undoped CsPbI2Br are at the Γ point, indicating that the undoped CsPbI2Br is a direct band gap semiconductor material with a band gap of 1.42 eV. It can be seen that the VBM of the undoped CsPbI2Br is mainly contributed by the I-5p and Br-4p orbitals and the CBM is mainly from the contribution of the Pb-6p orbital. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the band structure of the substitutional Mn-doped CsPbI2Br supercell seems denser than that of the undoped one. Furthermore, it is found that several impurity bands appear near the Fermi level and are caused by the Mn-3d orbital. As the Mn-3d orbital is half-filled by five electrons, these impurity bands within the band gap are also called intermediate bands (IBs). The IBs can act as an effective stepping stone to assist in pumping valence electrons into the conduction bands, i.e., the existence of IBs allows additional electronic transitions from the VB to the IB and from the IB to the CB in addition to the direct electronic transitions from the VB to the CB. As a result, the IBs could reduce the photon absorption energy threshold and enhance the photocurrent without the output voltage of solar cells being limited by this threshold. Although the undoped CsPbI2Br has a relatively wide band gap and is unsuitable for direct use as a light absorbing material of solar cells, the substitutional Mn-doped CsPbI2Br with intermediate band absorptions can be a promising candidate for the high-efficiency solar cells.32 Moreover, there are many novel intermediate band photovoltaic materials such as Ti or Cr-substituted CuGaS233,34 and Mn-doped AlGaN35 which also have been successfully fabricated in experiments by doping transition elements. Both the CBM and the VBM are at the Γ-point, indicating that the substitutional Mn-doped CsPbI2Br is still a direct band gap semiconductor.
 Fig. 4  Band structures and the total and partial density of states (DOS) for the undoped (a), substitutional Mn-doped (b) and interstitial Mn-doped CsPbI2Br (c). 
As can be seen in Fig. 4(c), the Fermi level goes through the CBM and the interstitial Mn-doped CsPbI2Br becomes an n-type semiconductor. There are several almost flat bands near the Fermi level and those bands are expected to give rise to a sharp peak in the density of states. It is clearly seen that the CBM is mainly contributed by the Pb-6p orbital and the peak at the Fermi level is mainly from the Mn-3d orbital.
The bonding characteristics of the undoped and Mn-doped CsPbI2Br were analyzed, as shown in Fig. 5. In Fig. 5(a), it is seen that the charge density around the Pb atom exhibits a strong locality and the bonds between Pb and I or Br atoms are a mix of ionic and covalent characteristics in the undoped CsPbI2Br. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the bonds between Mn and I or Br atoms in the substitutional Mn-doped CsPbI2Br possess similar bonding characteristics with the Pb–I or Pb–Br bonds in the undoped CsPbI2Br and the bond lengths of the former are shorter than those of the later. As can be seen in Fig. 5(c), for the interstitial Mn-doped CsPbI2Br, the I and Br atoms in the PbI4Br2 octahedron can be attracted by the Mn atom once the Mn atom enters the octahedral interstice of the CsPbI2Br supercell, leading to the deformation of the PbI4Br2 octahedron.

(d) The contour plots of the charge density difference on the (100) plane for the interstitial Mn-doped CsPbI2Br (the blue and red regions represent the depletion and accumulation of electrons, respectively). The charge density ranges from −0.01 eV Å−3 to 0.01 eV Å−3 and the contour interval 0.0005 eV Å−3. 
As shown in Fig. 5(d), when the Mn atom appears in the octahedral interstice, both Mn and I, Br atoms lose their partial valence electrons (see the blue regions around the Mn, I and Br atoms in Fig. 5(d)) and some electrons accumulate between the Mn and I (Br) atoms (see the red regions in Fig. 5(d)), indicating that the Mn–I and Mn–Br bonds are formed.
3.3 Optical properties of Mn-doped CsPbI2Br
The dielectric constants characterize the response of the dipole displacement in an external applied field in terms of ion and electron motion.36 The static dielectric constant (SDC) is an important parameter and can be obtained from the real part of the dielectric function. It is considered as the refractive index measured at a frequency above the lattice vibration frequencies.37 As shown in Fig. 6, the SDC values for the undoped, substitutional and interstitial Mn-doped CsPbI2Br are 4.97, 5.99 and 10.27, respectively. The imaginary part of the dielectric function specifies the interband transitions of the excited electrons. From Fig. 6(a), it is seen that the imaginary part ε2(ω) of the dielectric function for the undoped CsPbI2Br has three remarkable peaks and the peak at 2.84 eV is mainly the contribution of electron transitions from the VBM (I-5p and Br-4p) to the CBM (Pb-6p) (see Fig. 4(a)). From Fig. 6(b) and (c), it can be seen that the imaginary part ε2(ω) of the dielectric function for the substitutional and interstitial Mn-doped CsPbI2Br is nearly the same as that of the undoped CsPbI2Br when the energy is higher than 2.884 eV. The significant differences of ε2(ω) for the undoped and Mn-doped CsPbI2Br can be visually identified as the energy is lower than 2 eV. As shown in Fig. 6(c), a peak at 0.39 eV for the imaginary part of the dielectric function should be mainly derived from the electron transition between the VBM and the impurity band (see Fig. 4(c)).
 Fig. 6  Real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function for the undoped (a), substitutional Mn-doped (b) and interstitial Mn-doped CsPbI2Br (c). 
As shown in Fig. 7(a), the absorption coefficient of the undoped CsPbI2Br increases gradually when the photon energy is greater than 1.36 eV and reaches the maximum at 6.65 eV. The absorption coefficient spectrum is basically consistent with the characteristics reflected by the imaginary part of the dielectric function (see Fig. 6(a)). From Fig. 7(c), it is also found that an absorption peak appears at 0.61 eV for the interstitial Mn-doped CsPbI2Br. This absorption peak means that the photon energy of 0.61 eV can be absorbed by the interstitial Mn-doped CsPbI2Br and facilitate the electron transition from the impurity bands near the Fermi level to the CBM. Similar impurity levels have also been reported for the Mn-doped III–V compounds.38–40
 Fig. 7  Absorption coefficient spectrum of undoped (a), substitutional Mn-doped (b) and interstitial Mn-doped CsPbI2Br (c). 
By comparing the electronic and optical properties of the Mn-doped CsPbI2Br with those of the undoped one, we can see that (1) the thermodynamic stability of the substitutional and interstitial Mn-doped CsPbI2Br is significantly enhanced in terms of binding energy; (2) the introduction of the intermediate band in the substitutional Mn-doped CsPbI2Br enables triple-photon transitions, which is beneficial for improving the device performance of perovskite solar cells; for the interstitial Mn-doped CsPbI2Br, the n-type doping makes the conductivity of CsPbI2Br better; and (3) the static dielectric constant of the substitutional and interstitial Mn-doped CsPbI2Br increases significantly while their absorption coefficients can be compared favourably with those of the pure one.
4 Conclusions
The structural, electronic and optical properties of cubic CsPbI2Br and its two different Mn doping models have been calculated by using the first-principles calculation method based on density functional theory to understand the doping mechanism of Mn. The valence band maximum of the undoped CsPbI2Br is mainly contributed by the I-5p and Br-4p orbitals and the conduction band minimum is mainly contributed by the Pb-6p orbital. The binding energies of Mn-doped systems are negative, indicating that the substitutional and interstitial Mn-doped CsPbI2Br are stable. The electronic structure analysis shows that the impurity level contributed by the Mn-3d orbital acts as an intermediate band for the substitutional Mn-doped CsPbI2Br, which is beneficial to broaden the absorption range of light. For the interstitial Mn-doped CsPbI2Br, the Fermi level goes through the conduction band minimum, exhibiting the characteristics of an n-type semiconductor. The static dielectric constants of the Mn-doped CsPbI2Br are significantly increased in comparison with those of the undoped one. The substitutional Mn-doping mainly affects the electronic structure of CsPbI2Br and has little effect on its optical properties while the interstitial Mn-doping not only has an obvious effect on the electronic properties but also affects the optical properties, especially in the low-energy region. Our work could provide deeper understanding and guidance for further improving the performance of all-inorganic perovskite solar cells.
