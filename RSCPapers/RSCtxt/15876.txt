J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun., 1985, 719-720A singlet state-driven photogalvanic cell based on the photoreduction of 3,7-diaminophenoxazinylium chloride (‘oxonine’) by iron(II)(Note: The full text of this document is currently only available in the PDF Version )Newton C. Fawcett, David Creed, Robert L. Thompson and David W. PresserAbstractThe electrical characteristics and monochromatic power efficiency are given for the first singlet state-driven photogalvanic cell which is based on the photoreduction of the title dye by iron(II) with spontaneous regeneration of the dye and iron(II) from the charge carriers leuco-oxonine and iron(III) at the anode and cathode respectively.
