    , Accepted 1st September 2015First published on 1st September 2015AbstractThe photopolymerization of Co(II)/Co(III) complexes for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) by means of a fast, inexpensive, in situ and inhibition-free process has been examined. We have succeeded in fabricating high-performance DSSCs able to retain a light-to-electricity power conversion efficiency exceeding 6.5% (8.5% at low intensity) after 1800 h of mixed (light on/off, temperature high/low) accelerated aging tests, thus revealing a possible way for the stabilization of these record-holding redox pairs.
The advent of Co(II)/Co(III) complexes has profoundly revolutionized the scene in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),1 in terms of both performance and materials chemistry lying behind the different cell components.2–4 Indeed, cobalt-based redox shuttles, being non-volatile, non-corrosive and weakly coloured, made it possible to overcome the main drawbacks limiting the efficiency of iodine-based DSSCs. Moreover, the mismatch (≈0.6 V) between the redox potential of a typical sensitizer and that of the I−/I3− redox couple can be highly reduced in the presence of Co(II)/Co(III) complexes (due to its feasibility of tuneable energy level), thus possibly leading to higher open-circuit cell potential (Voc) values. Furthermore, the electronic structure of cobalt-based couples is particularly suitable for DSSC devices: indeed, the Co(II) component is in the high spin state (the resulting high reactivity favours dye regeneration), while the Co(III) species is in the low spin state (and would be relatively unreactive in the absence of the catalysts present at the counter electrode). Another advantage of cobalt complex redox shuttles is the ready tunability of their redox potential, by properly modifying the ligands surrounding the metal centre. Thanks to all of these peculiar characteristics, Co-based DSSCs attained the record light-to-electricity power conversion efficiency (η) values in the presence of both organometallic (13.0%)5 and metal-free organic dyes (12.8%).6 We would like to remark that the highest efficiencies with cobalt complex-based DSSCs need to be certified to be included in the “Best Research-Cell Efficiency” table by NREL.7 The best certified efficiency value is obtained by the Sharp company to be 11.9% using the I−/I3− redox couple. Stability problems with the standard Co(II)/Co(III)(bpy)3 complex in acetonitrile were observed by Kloo and coworkers, and it was stated that a small increase in the concentration of the redox couple together with the removal of the lithium-salt additive provided an initial improvement in the device stability.8 The same group jellified this electrolyte by adding poly(vinylidenefluoride) (PVDF), able to favour the ion-pair dissociation: η equal to 6.4% was measured, but the stability was not reported.9 The only study demonstrating the stabilization of Co-based electrolytes was proposed by Spiccia and co-workers, who jellified the redox shuttle with poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF–HFP). The resulting DSSC demonstrated η equal to 8.7%, and was stable up to 700 h of continuous illumination.10 The same polymeric matrix was also proposed by Kim's group, obtaining η equal to 4.3% (without stability tests).11
Although PVDF and PVDF–HFP have demonstrated good compatibility, stability and efficiency towards cobalt complex jellification, they present some disadvantages. First, these polymers require time-consuming and high temperature (100–150 °C) procedures for being dissolved in nitrile-based solvents,11 which is not favourable in view of their industrial scalability.12 Moreover, these polymeric gels are usually prepared ex situ and the proper impregnation of the active material particles into the pores of the photoanode is hardly achieved, thus limiting regeneration of dye molecules.13 In this respect, here we propose the in situ photopolymerization of electrolytes incorporating the Co(II)/Co(III) complex. The cobalt complex is embedded in UV-cross-linkable methacrylic oligomers bearing ethoxy chains, the length of which influences the chemical, electrochemical and thermal properties of the resulting quasi-solid electrolyte. Photopolymerization might represent the ideal technique for the preparation of polymer electrolytes for DSSCs at an industrial level, since it does not require the use of solvents, catalysts and purification/separation steps.14 Furthermore, an in situ light-induced process in the presence of a Co-based redox mediator would not suffer from the polymerization inhibition phenomena typically observed with the iodine-based redox pair.15
The whole preparation process of ready-to-use polymer electrolytes takes less than three minutes. Typically, bisphenol A ethoxylate dimethacrylate (BEMA, average Mn: 1700) and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA, average Mn: 700) are mixed with an acetonitrile-based solution containing 0.22 M Co(II)(bpy)3(PF6)2, 50 mM Co(III)(bpy)3(PF6)3 and 0.2 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (details in the ESI†). The different species are thoroughly mixed and, after the addition of the photoinitiator (Irgacure® 1173, 3 wt%), the resulting mixture is introduced in a pre-sealed DSSC via vacuum back-filling. The TiO2-based photoanode is sensitized by the LEG4 dye, while the detailed cell fabrication (Pt/FTO as the cathode) is reported in the ESI.† Afterwards, each cell is UV-irradiated from the counter electrode side for 1 min, allowing the methacrylic double bond conversion through photoinduced radical polymerization. Under UV-light, the dimethacrylate oligomer BEMA can form a cross-linked network, while the second oligomer – PEGMA – works as a reactive diluent: it reduces the cross-linking density of the 3D network, diminishes the glass transition temperature (Tg), and increases the mobility of the Co(II)/Co(III) complexes in the polymeric matrix by virtue of its pendant ethoxy groups. The chemical structures of electrolytes and dye components, along with the obtained polymeric architectures, are shown in Schemes S1–S3 in the ESI.†
The kinetics of photopolymerization was followed ex situ by real-time Fourier transform infrared (RT-FTIR) spectroscopy. The conversion profiles for the pristine BEMA:PEGMA mixture and the Co(II)/Co(III) complex-laden one are shown in Fig. 1A. It can be noticed that the presence of the redox mediator slightly lowered the conversion reaction rate, due to the hindrance created by the solvated Co(II)/Co(III) complex molecules interposed between the reactive methacrylic groups. Anyway, the rapidity of such a photoinduced process is definitely highlighted, particularly when compared to the processes traditionally adopted for the preparation of cobalt-based polymer electrolytes for DSSCs.9–11 The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the light-cured electrolyte was evaluated by dynamic mechanical thermal analyses (DMTA) as the maximum of the tanδ trend. Fig. 1B shows the resulting trace. A Tg equal to −56 °C was obtained, thus ensuring that the electrolyte is kept in the desired rubbery state under DSSC operational conditions. The thermal stability of the polymeric matrix, before and after the introduction of the Co(II)/Co(III) complex, was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). As shown in Fig. 1C, the electrolyte showed an initial degradation step slightly above 100 °C, due to the evaporation of the acetonitrile trapped in the 3D-cross-linked polymeric network. The second step (at around 350 °C) was ascribed to the degradation of the polymeric matrix. As a result, the photopolymerized electrolyte can be safely used under the standard DSSC working conditions (i.e., below 85 °C).

One major concern related to the use of polymer electrolytes (especially those encompassing cobalt-based redox mediators) is their proper penetration into the nanostructured photoanode, often resulting in the poor wetting of the active material particle surface, being detrimental to the overall device efficiency. We tried to solve this problem by the direct in situ photopolymerization of the liquid reactive mixture of oligomers and cobalt complexes along with the photoinitiator. The effective penetration of the low-viscosity (thanks to a BEMA:PEGMA 1:1 ratio) polymer electrolyte precursor in the mesoporous TiO2 electrodes (screen-printed on Pt-coated FTO substrates) with different thicknesses was assessed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), measuring the charge transport resistance at the Pt/electrolyte interface (RCE).16 As shown in Fig. 1D, RCE values remained nearly constant with increasing film thickness up to 7 μm, thus indicating that the UV-cured electrolyte may efficiently permeate the film through the entire thickness, thus resulting in a conformal coating of the active material nanoparticles. Upon further increasing the thickness, the RCE value gradually increased, which meant that the electrolyte penetration into the whole nanostructured TiO2 electrode became more difficult. Therefore, photoanodes with a thickness equal to 7 ± 0.15 μm were used for the fabrication of the DSSCs reported in this work.
The I–V plots for DSSCs assembled with either liquid or polymer electrolytes are shown in Fig. 2A and the results are summarized in Table 1. Despite a lower short-circuit current density (Jsc) value of ≈10%, it was interesting to note that the overall η value of the quasi-solid cell was slightly higher than that of the corresponding liquid counterpart under 1 Sun irradiation (6.6 vs. 6.4%, respectively, for the best performing cells). The quasi-solid cell showed a higher Voc value, as expected by the suppression of dark current by polymer chains covering the TiO2 nanoparticle surface. Moreover, the high Voc value can also be ascribed to the basic characteristic of the ethoxy units present in the BEMA:PEGMA system, which is likely to shift the voltage dependence of the electron density in TiO2 to more negative values, therefore minimizing the voltage dependence of the recombination losses within the cell.17 Open-circuit cell potential decay measurements (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†) confirmed the observed phenomenon, and the lower recombination reactions in the quasi-solid cell were also reflected in the improved fill factor (FF) value. Jsc values measured by I–V curves were in well agreement with the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the two cells shown in Fig. 2B. Globally, the most interesting aspect is that, despite the UV-curing process, the quasi-solid cell did not show a decrease of efficiency with respect to the liquid one.

One of the major issues related to cobalt-based redox shuttles is their relatively slow mass transport,18 due to their rather large molecular size, especially when compared with iodide-based redox mediators. In order to check whether, and to which extent, this problem is relevant in the investigated system, I–V data were also collected at different irradiation intensities (in the 0.2–0.8 Sun range), and the results are plotted in Fig. 2C and also summarized in Table 1. For the liquid cell, Jsc was proportional to incident light: a maximum efficiency of 6.8% was obtained at 0.2 Sun. On the other hand, the efficiency of the quasi-solid device raised up to 8.6% under 0.2 Sun (7.6% at 0.5 Sun), and a slight deviation from linearity in the dependence of Jscvs. irradiation intensity was observed above 0.8 Sun (Fig. 2C). This accounts for a slight limitation of the mass transport occurring between the cell electrodes when a cross-linked polymeric electrolyte is used; in more detail, the apparent diffusion coefficient of the quasi-solid electrolyte (1.93 × 10−6 cm2 s−1) was slightly lower than that of its liquid counterpart (2.11 × 10−6 cm2 s−1). However, the deviation from linearity was rather limited, and excellent cell performance at low irradiation levels was definitely remarkable (in fact, this is a keynote DSSC advantage in real outdoor applications). The detailed reason for this latter point needs further investigations. The explanation for the higher performance of the quasi-solid cell at the low irradiation level, being related to relative improvements in Jsc and FF, must be based on the lowering of recombination processes since losses due to series resistances can be ruled out due to the higher Jsc of the quasi-solid cell compared to the liquid one. As stated above, this photopolymer may act as a passivation layer at the TiO2/electrolyte interface.
The effect of the photo-cross-linked matrix on the ionic mass transport was further studied by monitoring photocurrent transients employing the modulation (on/off) of the incident light,10 as shown in Fig. 2D. In the presence of an ideal mass transport, the photocurrent should rapidly reach a maximum when the light is switched on, thereafter remaining constant. This condition was indeed satisfied at all the irradiation levels experimented for the liquid cell. For the quasi-solid device a small spike was initially observed at 1 Sun indicating a mass transport limitation at this high light intensity, and it is consistent with the deviation in short circuit current shown in Fig. 2C.
In order to assess the long-term stability of the cobalt-based DSSCs, a 1500 h aging test was carried out, adopting different accelerated aging conditions. In the first 1500 h, cells were kept at a temperature of 60 °C in the dark, and the resulting curves are shown in Fig. 3. The liquid cell was able to retain 42% of its initial efficiency after the aging test. This finding is consistent with those reported in the literature for the standard components of liquid-state cobalt-based lab-scale cells.8 In contrast, the cell assembled by in situ photopolymerization of the polymer electrolyte showed a very limited (5%) decay of the initial efficiency, thus demonstrating that the prepared polymeric network was able to effectively trap and retain the solvated Co(II)/Co(III) complex (as also shown by the RCE trend plotted in Fig. S2 in the ESI†). Moreover, the intimate electrolyte penetration through the photoanode, so as to efficiently regenerate the dye molecules upon I–V testing during the long-term aging period, was confirmed.
 Fig. 3  Long-term stability of DSSCs assembled with Co(II)/Co(III) complex-based liquid or polymer electrolytes: 60 °C in the dark in the initial 1500 h and 40 °C at 1 Sun without a UV filter from 1500 to 1800 h. 
In the second part of the aging experiment, cells were kept under continuous irradiation (1 Sun, without a UV filter) and thermostatized at 40 °C. As clearly visible in the right portion of Fig. 3, the irradiation increased the speed of the degradative phenomena. The liquid cell passed from a degradation rate of 0.93 to 3.91% per day (percentage calculated with respect to the initial value) when the light was switched on. On the other hand, the degradation rate of the quasi-solid cell increased from 0.08 to 0.39% per day when the irradiation started. We speculate that such an acceleration of the degradation phenomena can be attributed primarily to the UV component present in the radiation provided by the light source used in the experiment. This also explains why groups who have recently proposed the aging test of cobalt-based DSSCs decided to use UV-free LED sources10,19 or UV filters.20 Furthermore, a proper justification for the effect of UV light on the performance of cobalt-based cells, as well as an explanation for their more rapid degradation compared to iodine-based cells have not yet been proposed. For this purpose, it may be useful to point out that the chemical structure of a redox mediator such as Co(II/III)(bpy)3(PF6)2/3 resembles that of a photoinitiator for cationic polymerization,21,22 the latter being a salt able to generate superacids with Hammett acidities around −20 when irradiated.21 In this scenario, as the UV component of sunlight continuously impinges on the cell during the aging test, a gradually increasing amount of photogenerated superacids accumulates in the electrolyte. It is easy to imagine that the presence of a superacid (i.e., a species with an acidity greater than that of pure H2SO4) may damage the cell components and, consequently, the performance of the whole device over time. Despite the fact that continuous irradiation during aging tests accelerates these degradation phenomena (and others connected to highly reactive species)23 both in liquid and quasi-solid cells, it emerges from Fig. 3 that the degradation rate for the liquid device was ten times higher with respect to the quasi-solid one. Among all of the factors that explain the better stability of a quasi-solid cell, a special mention should surely be given to the presence of a three-dimensional polymer network surrounding the redox mediator. This polymer cage possesses a pegylated architecture, the latter being able to act as a UV-absorber that largely prevents the photodegradation of the cobalt-based redox mediator. Overall, the promising long-term stability as based on the results shown in this work is the highest ever reported for a laboratory-scale DSSC assembled with a polymerized cobalt-based electrolyte. It could be further improved by adopting the sealing technologies used in industry for organic electronics systems,24 by coating the external side of the photoanode with a luminescent downshifting layer (also behaving as a UV cutter),25 or by replacing the PF6− anions (also behaving as the dangerous source of hydrofluoric acid in the presence of water traces)26 with suitable alternatives.
In summary, we have proposed the in situ photo-cross-linking of Co(II)/Co(III) complexes for remarkably stable DSSCs. Noticeably, the preparation process is rapid as well as easily scalable at the industrial level, and allows the proper coating of the dye-sensitized active material particles by the quasi-solid electrolyte. These three aspects, together with an efficiency equal to 6.6% at 1 Sun (which increases up to 8.6% at lower irradiation intensity), render the proposed system an ideal solution to stabilize the performance of cobalt-based redox electrolytes. Moreover, the performance of such a system can be further improved by co-sensitization with dyes able to ensure a panchromatic absorption, as recently proposed by the record-cells assembled with cobalt-based systems.5,6
