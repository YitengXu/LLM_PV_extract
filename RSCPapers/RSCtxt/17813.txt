    , Accepted 30th August 2012First published on 3rd September 2012AbstractThe strong efforts devoted to the exploration of BNH compounds for hydrogen storage have led to impressive advances in the field of boron chemistry. This review summarizes progress in this field from three aspects. It starts with the most recent developments in using BNH compounds for hydrogen storage, covering NH3BH3, B3H8− containing compounds, and CBN compounds. The following section then highlights interesting applications of BNH compounds in hydrogenation and catalysis. The last part is focused on breakthroughs in the syntheses and discovery of new BNH organic analogues. The role of N–Hδ+⋯Hδ−–B dihydrogen interactions in molecule packing, thermal hydrogen evolution, and syntheses is also discussed within the review.Zhenguo HuangZhenguo Huang received a Ph.D. in Materials Science at the University of Wollongong, Australia, in 2007. This was followed by a postdoctoral appointment at The Ohio State University, working on boron related compounds for hydrogen storage. In 2011, he won a Discovery Early Career Research Award – “DECRA” from the Australian Research Council, supporting further research in the field of nitrogen–boron containing compounds for hydrogen storage.Tom AutreyTom Autrey, a Staff Scientist in the Catalysis Science group at PNNL received his Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of Illinois in 1987. His research interests include small molecule activation and approaches to energy storage for fuel cell power. Currently he is using spectroscopy and calorimetry to develop energy landscapes to describe the kinetics and thermodynamics of heterolytic activation of hydrogen in frustrated and unfrustrated Lewis acid–base pairs.

Broader context
Hydrogen is believed to be an ideal synthetic fuel for the future. It can be a highly effective medium to store and transfer energy produced by renewable resources such as wind and solar, whose intermittent nature presents challenges to their wide deployment. Its chemical energy can be extracted using a fuel cell to power an electrical engine at very high efficiency, and this process produces virtually no pollution. One key technological challenge for the transformation to hydrogen-based energy is to find a cost effective and efficient way to store hydrogen. A hydrogen storage system for both stationary and mobile applications must possess a number of characteristics, such as high storage capacity, fast kinetics, long cycle life, cost efficiency and safety under normal use. Solid state hydrogen storage has attracted substantial research and development around the world, since it offers higher volumetric and gravimetric capacities than traditional compression and liquefaction. Intense efforts have been directed towards research on boron–nitrogen–hydrogen (BNH) compounds, among which, ammonia borane is the outstanding example. The strong investment in BNH by government agencies, universities, and companies has led to a much improved understanding of boron chemistry, which provides essential guidance in the search for ideal hydrogen storage candidates, as well as interesting applications in other fields.

1. Introduction
Boranes and boron–nitrogen–hydrogen (denoted as BNH in this review) compounds attracted intense study in the 1950s, almost exclusively for military applications.1,2 Although the goal of using these compounds as high energy fuels for jets was never achieved, the concerted effort did result in a wealth of technical information on boron chemistry.3–8 Half a century of dormancy then followed, with only scattered research carried out. Most recently, BNH compounds have regained intense attention due to their potential application as hydrogen storage materials.9–18 Among these compounds, ammonia borane (AB) has been studied the most, since it (1) has a high hydrogen content of 19.4 wt% and (2) releases 12 wt% hydrogen at moderate temperatures (<120 °C).19–21 AB is arguably one of the promising candidates to meet many of the criteria set by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for automotive applications.22
Two main DOE criteria relate to gravimetric and volumetric densities (Table 1).23 These numbers refer to the whole system, including the container, heater, piping, materials, etc. Therefore, a compound with 5.5 wt% hydrogen fails to meet the 2017 target. There are other critical parameters, such as stability at high temperatures under long dormancy and sufficient kinetics within appropriate temperature and pressure ranges. One of the challenges is to have a hydrogen storage material that can release H2 efficiently using the waste heat from a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell, ∼80 °C, and simultaneously is indefinitely stable at 60 °C. This represents an enormous change in reactivity over a narrow temperature range, i.e., 0 g H2 per s below 60 °C and > 1 g H2 per s at 80 °C.24 To make AB suitable for practical applications, it is not necessary to destabilize it to afford a faster rate at 80 °C, but it is necessary to maintain control of thermal management of the exothermic reaction to keep the temperature from going too high. Therefore, approaches to enhance stability at 60 °C are much more important than approaches to destabilize AB to get faster rates at 80 °C.25

As with any strong effort devoted to a certain field, the research carried out by national laboratories, academic institutions and their industry partners around the world has further enriched the field of boron chemistry. This includes, but is not limited to, a much improved understanding of reaction mechanisms,26–29 promising new applications,30–33 and the discovery of new BNH compounds.34–36 Several excellent reviews on BNH compounds have been published with a focus on hydrogen storage.37–40 In contrast with these surveys, the present review highlights not only the most recent progress (largely from 2010 onwards) in hydrogen storage, but also includes studies of catalysis and reduction reactions (i.e. hydrogenation) and syntheses of new BNH compounds. This work is accordingly broken down into these areas, with an emphasis on important breakthroughs that may provide guidance for further research.
In BNH compounds, the H bound to the more electronegative N is protic and the H bound to the less electronegative B is hydridic.41–43 These two types of H atoms are commonly found to form a special interaction, i.e., N–Hδ+⋯Hδ−–B, defined as the “dihydrogen bond” by Richardson, Gala, and Crabtree,43 a term which is widely used these days in most of the literature.44–47 As will be seen from this present review, the dihydrogen interaction plays an important role in molecule packing in crystals and H2 evolution. Several chemical reactions have been designed and carried out successfully based on this unique interaction.

2. Hydrogen storage
This section summarizes the latest developments in this field (Table 2), focusing on AB, alkali metal aminoboranes, diammoniate of diborane ([(NH3)2BH2][BH4]) (DADB), and octahydrotriborates (B3H8−), as well as C, B, and N containing compounds (denoted as CBN in this review), such as ethane 1,2-di-amineborane (BH3NH2CH2CH2NH2BH3) (EDAB) and CBN heterocycles.
2.1 AB

2.1.1 Hydrogen evolution pathways. 
Several means have been regularly employed to extract H2 from AB, i.e., hydrolysis,48–50 solid state thermal decomposition with/without the aid of additives and metal catalysts,51–54 decomposition of AB in liquids with55–58 or without catalysts,28,59,60 and more recently using AB in pumpable slurries similar to the approach of Safe Hydrogen.61,62 Since the hydrolytic reaction affords stable B–O bonds, the reformation of AB is highly energy intensive and consequently an economic challenge. Solid state thermal decomposition is believed to proceed via the intermediate DADB and finally results in polymeric BNH compounds.26 Decomposition of AB in ionic liquid (IL) follows the same pathway, but often with significantly enhanced rates most likely as a result of enhanced heat transfer and the stabilization of DADB in ionic liquids59
AB decomposition in organic solvents has not yet been well studied, but recent work by Mertens' group identified interesting concentration dependent dehydrogenation behavior.60 DADB influences the rates of several dehydrogenation steps by interacting with various other intermediates. In highly concentrated solutions, a similar decomposition mechanism to that of solid AB was observed. Although the liquid medium adds a weight penalty to the system capacity, it affords easier transport of final decomposition products compared with the solid state. A recent study by a team of researchers in the Engineering Center of Excellence has shown that the performance of AB slurries can meet most of the U.S. DOE 2017 criteria (Fig. 1).62

Thermally induced AB dehydrogenation that is catalyzed by metal complexes in organic solutions tends to proceed via the formation of aminoborane (NH2BH2), which oligomerizes to cyclic intermediates or undergoes dehydropolymerization to polyborazylene (Scheme 1).58,63,64 In addition to noble metals,57,65–67 cost effective transition metal based catalysts have also proved very effective.55,68 There exists a great variety of transition metal complexes and thus plenty of room for exploration and potential improvement with respect to efficacy and cost.
 Scheme 1  Proposed metal-catalyzed reaction pathways for AB dehydrogenation.58 
Thermal decomposition of neat AB suffers from the formation of traces of undesirable volatile products such as ammonia (NH3) and borazine (B3N3H6).69–71 Many methods have been employed to suppress the formation of these impurities, such as the introduction of metal catalysts72–74 and additives.53,54,75 Among these efforts, metal amidoboranes (MAB), such as Li/Na/KNH2BH3 and Ca(NH2BH3)2, have shown improved hydrogen release performance in terms of purity and kinetics, and therefore have attracted broad attention.76–80 Autrey's group found that H2 release from MAB compounds proceeds through a bimolecular mechanism involving MH (M = Li, Na, or K) compounds as intermediates.81 The decomposition products resulting from the release of 1 equivalent of H2 from these MAB compounds indicate the presence of both BH3 and sp2 hybridized BH groups, which are significantly different from the products formed after H2 release from AB. Theoretical work by Kim et al.,82 and Lee and McKee83 demonstrates a similar role for metals in facilitating the formation of H2 by forming metal hydride intermediates during the decomposition. Recently, McGrady's group revealed new homopolar H⋯H interactions: viz. B–Hδ−⋯δ−H–B and N–Hδ+⋯δ+H–N, in addition to Mδ+⋯δ−H–B and N–Hδ+⋯δ−H–B interactions (Fig. 2).84 Upon heating, isotopomer LiND2BH3 gives off a significant quantity of H2 along with HD, which can only arise from hydride–hydride interactions, either directly from B–Hδ−⋯δ−H–B moieties or indirectly through the participation of Li–H intermediates. This finding indicates that the whole H2 evolution process can be complex and can involve more than N–Hδ+⋯δ−H–B interactions alone.

2.1.2 Regeneration of AB. 
To make AB a practical storage medium for large scale applications, its efficient and economic regeneration from spent fuel is critical. The spent fuel is believed to be a mixture of polyaminoborane (PAB) and polyiminoborane (PIB), with a general formulation that can be expressed as “BNHx”, with x varying between 0.5 and 1.85
Early efforts devoted to the regeneration of AB have been summarized.39 These earlier efforts have demonstrated that the regeneration of AB is possible, but with high complexity and cost, and low efficiency.86,87 It is known that the transition metals Rh, Co, and Ni can be used to activate molecular hydrogen to metal hydrides at moderate temperature and pressure.88 A concerted effort was made to find metal hydrides with sufficient hydride donor ability to transfer a hydride to a borate ester that could be generated in the digestion of spent BNH fuels with a range of alcohols. This approach used a combination of experiment and theory to match the H− affinity of the borate ester with the H− donor capability of the metal hydride to maximize efficiency and minimize energy steps.89,90

Fig. 3 shows that not all borate esters are the same, and there is a wide range of H− affinity, depending on the structural and electronic properties of the borate ester. An important outcome of this work was to show that borate esters are not a thermodynamic dead end: in fact, there are a range of borate esters that can be reduced by metal hydrides. On a parallel scale, Fig. 3 shows that the hydride donating capability of the metal hydride can be tuned by changing either the metal or the ligands attached to the metal.

Scheme 2 shows the 5 key steps of an overall process that regenerates AB from H2 with recycling of other reagents and the solvent. Each step of the process has been studied in detail to gain insight into the factors that affect reactivity and efficiency.92 While each key step has been demonstrated, further work is needed to optimize the process and make the activation of hydrogen catalytic.

Very recently, a surprising, and efficient one pot regeneration method has been reported.93 In all previous cases, metal hydrides were used to regenerate the hydridic B–H bonds, however, in this new method, anhydrous hydrazine, not typically considered to provide hydridic hydrogen, almost completely converts polyborazylene back to AB via treatment with hydrazine (N2H4) in liquid NH3 at 40 °C in a sealed pressure vessel. This process involves neither noble metal nor transition metal catalysts, and while the mechanism of B–H bond formation is not understood the process is simple and efficient (up to 95% yield). Fig. 4 illustrates the closed cycle for the usage and reformation of AB. Hydrazine, however, is in limited production worldwide. Large-scale economical production is thus needed to make this method a practical industrial process.

The optimum regeneration process for BNH hydrogen storage materials will require catalysts to activate hydrogen, e.g., to make hydrazine from nitrogen or boranes form borates. Using any material besides hydrogen, a metal hydride or hydrazine in stoichiometric amounts will be very difficult to accomplish economically at large scales.

2.2 Diammoniate of diborane (DADB)
In contrast to the intensive attention devoted to AB as a potential hydrogen storage material, much less is known about the isomer, DADB, in spite of its discovery predating that of AB.94,95 DADB has been experimentally proven to be an intermediate during the thermal decomposition of AB and AB/IL blends,26,58 but its synthesis and isolation have always been challenging until very recently. Here, we summarize the most recent progress on this compound, with a focus on its preparation.
The earlier syntheses of DADB used direct reaction of B2H6 and NH3 at cryogenic temperatures.96,97 These methods, however, do not afford high purity. In addition, B2H6 is highly flammable and thus very difficult to handle. Autrey's group recently developed a solid state synthesis of DADB by reacting ammonium borohydride (NH4BH4) with AB.98 NH4BH4 was first synthesized by reacting NH4F and NaBH4 in liquid NH3 at −78 °C. After a 1:1 molar mixture of AB and NH4BH4 was mechanically mixed in a SPEX mill for 10 minutes, phase pure DADB was obtained. The reaction mechanism can be expressed as: NH4BH4 + NH3BH3 → [(NH3)2BH2][BH4] + H2(1)
The authors solved the crystal structure of DADB from a combination of X-ray and neutron powder diffraction analysis using Rietveld refinement. There are two crystallographically distinct BH4− sites which coordinate with neighbouring (NH3)2BH2+ ions in different ways (Fig. 5). The nearest N–Hδ+⋯Hδ−–B distances range from 1.8 to 2.1 Å, indicating the presence of dihydrogen interactions.
 Fig. 5  Crystal structure of DADB viewed along the c-axis. The two crystallographically distinct BH4− sites are indicated.98 
A modified synthetic route has been developed by Fang et al.99 Instead of isolating pure NH4BH4, they ball milled NaBH4 together with NH4F using a low energy Fritsch 7 planetary mill. The X-ray diffraction pattern indicates the formation of DADB and NaF. About 1 mole H2 per mole of NaBH4 (or NH4F) was observed after 3 h milling. The reaction seems to follow the same pathways as those of Autrey's method.98 Initially, NH4BH4 was formed during the ball milling (eqn (2)), and then part of it decomposed into NH3BH3 and H2 upon further milling (eqn (3)). The newly formed NH3BH3 was then reacted with NH4BH4 and produced DADB (eqn (4)). This modified method simplifies manipulation of the reaction and is feasible for bench-top scale synthesis in a typical laboratory. 2NaBH4 + 2NH4F → 2NH4BH4 + 2NaF(2) NH4BH4 → NH3BH3 + H2(3) NH4BH4 + NH3BH3 → DADB + H2(4)
Another quite different method has also been developed.100 This synthesis, however, involves more steps and has a complex set-up associated with handling gaseous HCl and liquid NH3. Although DADB remains stable in the solid state if stored in an inert atmosphere, it undergoes quick decomposition in solvents at room temperature with partial conversion to AB.100
Upon heating, DADB undergoes decomposition in two steps, similar to those of AB (Fig. 6).99 The onset temperature for the first step, however, is lower for DADB than for AB. DADB exhibits no appreciable induction period, even at moderate temperatures, while AB suffers from a long induction period prior to H2 release. This is consistent with the finding that DADB is an intermediate during the decomposition of AB. It has also been noted that AB is an intermediate in the decomposition of DADB and that the mixture of the two are more reactive then either species independently. Evidence for this arises from the observation that the 11B NMR of the product, PAB, is identical no matter the starting material,31 AB or DADB, and the observation that the rate of H2 release from AB or DADB is identical during the ‘second half-life’ consistent with a similar decomposition pathway after the establishment of an equilibrium, eqn (5) and (6) (Fig. 7).31 2AB ⇔ DADB(5) AB + DADB → PAB(6)

Sneddon's group has also reported the superior performance of DADB over AB in terms of decomposition in ionic liquid, where a faster release rate from DADB has been observed.59
2.3 Octahydrotriborate
There exist a variety of BmHn moieties that are either neutral, such as B2H6 and B4H10, or carry one or two negative charges, BH4− and B12H122− for instance. So far, NH3BH3 and NaBH4 have been intensively studied. One BH condensation up on the ladder from these is B2H6, however, its explosive and toxic nature virtually eliminates it from any significant attention. Another BH condensation up is B3H7 (best known in the form of NH3B3H7) and B3H8−, both of which have high hydrogen content. Sneddon's group have carried out outstanding work on NH3B3H7, from synthesis and the structure solution to hydrogen release.101,102 Beyond these initial reports, little follow-up work on NH3B3H7 has been done, so this review is focused on B3H8− compounds.

2.3.1 NH4B3H8. 
Although NaB3H8 does not contain N, it will be briefly discussed because of its importance as a precursor to other B3H8− compounds. NaB3H8 has a higher hydrogen capacity (12.6 wt% H) compared with the intensively studied NaBH4 (10.8 wt%). Historically, NaB3H8 was obtained in a solvated form and then used as a precursor for further syntheses of other B3H8−/B3H7 compounds.103–108 From a hydrogen storage point of view, the unsolvated form of NaB3H8 is necessary because solvents add penalty weight. The synthesis of unsolvated NaB3H8, however, traditionally requires B2H6.109,110 Recently, Huang et al. developed a B2H6-free method to synthesize unsolvated NaB3H8 with a yield close to 70%.111 There is concern over this route, however, since mercury is used, although it can be recycled. Chong et al. have reported an alternative solvent free synthesis of Mg(B3H8)2 with about 12% yield in the thermal decomposition of Mg(BH4)2 at 300 °C.112 Heating at lower temperatures for longer periods of time, 250 °C for 5 weeks, did lead to higher yields however further work is required to optimize this synthetic pathway.
Ammonium octahydrotriborate (NH4B3H8) has a very high hydrogen content of 20.5 wt%. The original synthesis reported 40 years ago involved pentaborane (B5H9), which is highly volatile and inflames violently upon contact with air.113,114 Pentaborane-free patents were later developed, but the procedures are complicated, requiring intermediate compounds and large amounts of solvents.115 Huang et al. recently found that by reacting unsolvated NaB3H8 with NH4Cl in liquid NH3 at −78 °C, NH4B3H8 was formed and could be extracted using dry tetrahydrofuran (THF).116 This process can also be carried out with solvated NaB3H8, since (1) solvents coordinated to NaB3H8 will not change the course of the reaction; (2) NH4B3H8 can be easily isolated using THF; and (3) the NaCl side product is insoluble in most organic solvents. In this case, different synthetic routes to solvated NaB3H8 can be employed, and thus mercury can be avoided.103–105
A separate ion pair structure exists in NH4B3H8 (Fig. 8), with the shortest N–Hδ+⋯Hδ−–B distance being 2.37 Å, very close to the sum of the van der Waals radii between two hydrogen atoms, 2.4 Å. All other N–Hδ+⋯Hδ−–B distances are more than 2.47 Å. These dihydrogen distances are longer that those observed in NH3B3H7102 and NH3BH3.117 NH4B3H8 in pure and solid form is stable at room temperature, with no detectable signs of decomposition within one month.

DSC and TGA results collectively indicate that melting and decomposition take place simultaneously at 120 °C, with a substantial weight loss at this temperature (Fig. 9).116 However, only 10 wt% of the weight loss is associated with H2, while the rest is due to the formation of B2H6, B5H9, and B3N3H6. Thus, NH4B3H8 is not a suitable candidate for hydrogen storage through thermal decomposition without additional work.

Hydrolytic studies, however, have demonstrated that NH4B3H8 has advantages over NaBH4 and NH3BH3, the most studied chemical hydrides for hydrogen storage via hydrolysis. NH4B3H8 is more soluble in water (>45 wt%) than NH3BH3 (26 wt%)118 and NaBH4 (35 wt%).119 The lower solubility limits the theoretical hydrogen density of the respective systems to 5.1 wt% for NH3BH3 and 7.5 wt% for NaBH4. Hydrolysis showed that 1 mmol NH4B3H8 releases a near theoretical value of 8.80 mmol H2. Based on eqn (7), therefore, this system has a high theoretical hydrogen weight density (wt% = H2/(NH4B3H8 + H2O)) of 10.8 wt%. (7)
Unlike NaBH4, which is stable only in strong alkaline solutions,120,121 an aqueous NH4B3H8 solution is reasonably stable. At 28 °C, for the same molar concentration, i.e., 2 M, 11B nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies showed that more than 50% of NaBH4 decomposed over one day, while less than 10% of NH4B3H8 decomposed over a week.116 Calculations indicate that H2 release from NH4B3H8 is much less exothermic than from NaBH4, NH3BH3, or NH3B3H7. Its less exothermic nature favors NH4B3H8 over the other candidates from the standpoint of heat management and system design.

This compound has a high hydrogen content of 18.2 wt%, however, the only available syntheses involve tetraborane (B4H10), which is highly volatile and combusts violently upon contact with air.122,123 Furthermore, B4H10 is not commercially available, and its synthesis remains complex and challenging.124 There have been few studies on this compound since its discovery 50 years ago. Huang et al. recently developed a safe and efficient synthesis method for this compound and studied its thermal decomposition properties.125
By utilizing two well-known reactions: NH3 reacting with THF·BH3 to form DADB and AB,95,126 and DADB reacting with NH4Cl to produce (NH3)2BH2Cl,11,127 Huang et al. obtained (NH3)2BH2B3H8via the metathesis between NaB3H8 and (NH3)2BH2Cl. This procedure avoids flammable starting materials and produces high purity products, as evidenced by the NMR spectra (Fig. 10).

The DSC and TGA results indicate that melting and decomposition take place simultaneously at 100 °C and finish at around 160 °C, with a total weight loss of 40 wt%. Approximately 15 wt% of the weight loss is due to H2 evolution, while the rest is associated with B2H6, B5H9, and B3N3H6.
It is well known that thermal decomposition of B3H8 containing compounds tends to generate B5H9 and/or B2H6.105,107 The presence of the protonic NH groups seems to suppress the formation of these boranes and facilitates the formation of H2, considering the total 70 wt% weight loss and the 10 wt% H2 for NH4B3H8 (Hδ+:Hδ− = 3:6), compared to the total 40 wt% weight loss and 15 wt% H2 for (NH3)2BH2B3H8 (Hδ+:Hδ− = 3:5).

2.4. CBN compounds

2.4.1 Ethane 1,2-di-amineborane (BH3NH2CH2CH2NH2BH3) (EDAB). 
EDAB has recently been studied as a promising hydrogen storage candidate (Fig. 11).128 EDAB possesses a number of distinct advantages compared with AB. First of all, it is more stable than AB at temperatures lower than 100 °C, indicating that storage at high temperature (>60 °C) for a prolonged period is practical. Secondly, it releases hydrogen more rapidly than AB at temperatures higher than 120 °C, and this means that EDAB is more effective at providing H2 when needed, especially during acceleration (Fig. 12). A fast rate at the release temperatures coupled with stability at high storage temperatures is a significant concern for practical storage, but this has so far been elusive for approaches aimed at enhancing the rate of hydrogen release from solid AB. The enthalpy of H2 release is less exothermic than for AB, amounting to approximately −10 kJ mol−1 H2 and −4 kJ mol−1 H2 for the first and second steps, respectively, which will simplify heat management in practical devices. Furthermore, there are no detectable impurities, and in particular, no B3N3H6, NH3, or B2H6. The absence of B3N3H6 and NH3 is not a surprise as it is difficult to provide a mechanism to show how they would be formed from EDAB, however, the absence of B2H6 needs further study as it is difficult to detect given the high reactivity.

2.4.2 Heterocycles. 
This class of compounds (i.e., cyclic molecules containing C, B, and N) for hydrogen storage has recently been investigated by Liu's group from the University of Oregon.129–131 The aim of this research is to develop liquid hydrogen storage materials to make use of the existing liquid fuel distribution channels such as pipelines and tankers, which would be more cost-effective compared with transporting solid hydrogen storage materials. Liu's group has carried out elaborate work on the synthesis, catalytic dehydrogenation, and regeneration of several CBN heterocycles. One sample of particular interest is BN-methylcyclopentane (Scheme 3),132 which is in liquid form under ambient conditions. Upon adding cheap catalysts such as FeCl2 and NiCl2, this compound can give off H2 at temperatures below or at 80 °C, with the formation of a single dehydrogenation product that is also a liquid at room temperature. The authors have also demonstrated the conversion of the dehydrogenated product back to the charged fuel with a 92% yield under relatively mild conditions. Although the material capacity (4.7 wt%) falls short of the 2017 target for automobile applications (5.5 wt% system),23 this research demonstrates a viable H2 storage option for portable and carrier applications.

As the complex decomposes to a liquid product, this approach enables a much simpler system design with respect to fuel feed and recovery. In addition, the low dehydrogenation temperature indicates that waste heat from a proton exchange membrane fuel cell can be used, which allows a highly efficient use of energy. As noted by the authors, to make the process cost-effective, an economical regeneration process needs to be developed.

3. Applications in hydrogenation
Due to its high hydrogen content and reducing capability, AB has also been studied as a hydrogenating agent in organic syntheses, such as converting aldehydes to alcohols133–135 and reducing cyclohexyl imines and iminium salts.136 In those studies, AB was thought to transfer hydridic H on boron to unsaturated functional groups. Recent work, however, reveals a different mechanism. Berke and co-workers found that AB reduces imine through a concerted double hydrogen transfer process, where the protic H(N) and hydridic H(B) are transferred to the nitrogen and carbon ends of the imine group, respectively.137 This double-hydrogen transfer process was also observed by Manner et al. in the case of NB double bond reduction,138 and by Chen during the hydrogenation of aromatic aldehydes by AB.139
This double-electron transfer process also renders AB applicable in renewable energy research from a different perspective. It is well known that CO2 is the main contributing factor to global warming and climate change. Reduction of CO2 to a useful fuel such as methanol has surfaced as a chemical challenge of great interest. Due to its limited reactivity, CO2 reduction is currently achieved by using electrocatalysts or heterogeneous photocatalysts that involve transition-metal containing complexes and materials.140,141 Recently, Stephan et al. described a rapid, room temperature conversion of frustrated Lewis pair (FLP)-activated CO2 to CH3OH using AB as the hydrogen source, without the assistance of a transition metal (Scheme 4).142 First, PMes3 (Mes = 2,4,6-C6H2Me3) and AlX3 (X = Cl, Br) react to form weak Lewis adducts, which then can react irreversibly with CO2. After the solution reacts with AB, H2O is introduced to produce CH3OH, which can be extracted with a decent yield of 37–51%. Theoretical investigations by Zimmerman et al. suggested that AB reduces CO2 through the two-hydrogen transfer process.32,143 This pioneering research is expected to provide valuable insights for developing strategies for CO2 reduction using AB as an efficient reducing agent, although regeneration of AB from the end products will be challenging, since B–O bonds tend to form upon adding H2O. The ultimate economic impact is likely to be dependent on the energy output from consuming CH3OH versus the energy input from converting B–O to B–H in a catalytic regeneration reaction.

In a related report Ashley and co-workers demonstrated that an amine borane complex could be used to activate both hydrogen and CO2 to make CH3OH in a stoichiometric reaction.144
4. Catalysis
Prior to Welch and Stephan's observation that H2 could be added reversibly across a frustrated Lewis pair of phosphine and borane,145 the common dogma was that metals were required to activate hydrogen. Sumerin and co-workers, however, demonstrated reversible hydrogen addition to a structurally linked amine borane complex (Scheme 5).146

This was the first example of reversible ‘hydrogen storage’ in an amine borane complex. While the quantity of hydrogen is too low to be of practical significance for hydrogen storage applications, it is an important result because it shows that amine borane complexes can be used to activate hydrogen at moderate temperature and pressure to be used in catalytic reduction reactions. Since these pioneering studies, there have been several examples demonstrating the catalytic reduction of unsaturated polar molecules by a wide range of amine-borane frustrated Lewis pairs.147 This is an exciting new area of research using amine boranes for applications beyond hydrogen storage, and the field is rapidly growing with new examples of hydrogen activation for catalysis being reported.
5. Synthesis of new inorganic analogues
Serendipity has again made an amazingly good appearance with the reports of new BNH compounds during these extensive studies, which further enriches the chemistry of boron. Studying the activating effects of Verkade's base (VB), 2,8,9-triisobutyl-2,5,8,9-tetraaza-1-phosphabicyclo[3.3.3]undecane, on the rate and extent of H2 release from AB, Sneddon's group discovered the formation of [C18H39N4PH][H3BNH2BH2NH2BH3], [C18H39N4PH][HB(NH2BH3)3], and [C18H39N4PH][H3BNH2BH2NH2BH2NH2BH3] (Scheme 6), which are isoelectronic and isostructural analogues of the hydrocarbons n-pentane, 3-ethylpentane, and n-heptane, respectively.34 Considering the synthesis conditions (room-temperature for the five-membered and 50 °C for the seven-membered compounds), these anionic aminoborane oligomers are likely to be early intermediates in base-promoted AB H2 release reactions. Sequential H2 elimination reactions lead to chain growth, which is likely facilitated by N–Hδ+⋯Hδ−–B dihydrogen-bonding interactions in these anionic aminoborane chains.

Aminodiborane (NH2B2H5) was first discovered 70 years ago through a tedious procedure using B2H6.148 Little subsequent study has occurred because of its scarce availability. Recently, Chen et al. found that when AB and THF·BH3 were mixed together at room temperature, NH2B2H5 was formed via the formation of a dihydrogen bond and subsequent molecular hydrogen elimination (Scheme 7).36 A concentrated NH2B2H5·THF solution (1:1 ratio, based upon the integration of the hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum) can be obtained with a yield of 70%. When NH3 was bubbled into a solution of NH2B2H5, an inorganic butane analogue, NH3BH2NH2BH3, was formed, a reaction which likely proceeded via the breaking of the bridge hydrogen bond in NH2B2H5 (Scheme 7).

Another breakthrough occurred in the syntheses of the long-sought unsubstituted aminodiboranate Na(H3BNH2BH3) and its N-alkyl analogs.35 [NH4][H3BNH2BH3] was first proposed by Schlesinger and Berg to formulate DADB,96 although later spectroscopic studies established that DADB is actually the borohydride salt [(NH3)2BH2][BH4]. After being neglected for about 80 years, this anion was proved to exist by Girolami et al., who found that when AB with excess Na in THF was subject to reflux, Na(H3BNH2BH3) is formed. This new compound displays a downfield 11B NMR chemical shift compared with AB and NaNH2BH3 (Fig. 13).35 Similar reactions with other amine-boranes afford Na(H3BNRR′BH3). Na(H3BNH2BH3) can also be generated by reaction of 2 equivalent of AB with NaNH2 in refluxing THF, which results in a better yield (50%). 4HNRR′·BH3 + 2Na → 2Na(H3BNRR′BH3) + H2 + 2HNRR′(8)

6. Conclusion
Whether BNH compounds hold the key to hydrogen storage remains uncertain, but the current renewed interest and strong efforts have so far resulted in a much improved understanding of boron chemistry. There has been enhanced recognition of the H–H interactions, including both N–Hδ+⋯δ−H–B (dihydrogen bond) and the homopolar interactions, B–Hδ−⋯δ−H–B and N–Hδ+⋯δ+H–N, in relation to crystal structure and H2 evolution. The development of safe and efficient syntheses of existing compounds will enable further studies of their applications. The discovery of new compounds certainly enriches the field of boron chemistry by opening up room for new syntheses and new applications. The catalysis and hydrogenation work using ammine borane complexes is exciting; few chemists would have suggested just over 6 years ago that hydrogen could be activated at low temperature and pressure without using transition metals.
The employment of modern advanced techniques, such as high field solid state NMR spectrometers and high level density functional theory (DFT) calculation tools, together with worldwide collaborations, offers a very strong edge over the studies in the 1950s. It has to be acknowledged, however, that the pioneering work carried out by A. Stock, H. I. Schlesinger, D. M. Ritter, A. B. Burg, P. W. Parry, M. F. Hawthorne, H. C. Brown, S. G. Shore, etc. has laid a solid foundation for the work of today. Their earlier experimental findings and speculations are often referred to and provide guidance for today's research. Likewise, today's outcomes will also shed light on future research in this field.

Zhenguo Huang	Zhenguo Huang received a Ph.D. in Materials Science at the University of Wollongong, Australia, in 2007. This was followed by a postdoctoral appointment at The Ohio State University, working on boron related compounds for hydrogen storage. In 2011, he won a Discovery Early Career Research Award – “DECRA” from the Australian Research Council, supporting further research in the field of nitrogen–boron containing compounds for hydrogen storage.
Tom Autrey	Tom Autrey, a Staff Scientist in the Catalysis Science group at PNNL received his Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of Illinois in 1987. His research interests include small molecule activation and approaches to energy storage for fuel cell power. Currently he is using spectroscopy and calorimetry to develop energy landscapes to describe the kinetics and thermodynamics of heterolytic activation of hydrogen in frustrated and unfrustrated Lewis acid–base pairs.

Broader context
Hydrogen is believed to be an ideal synthetic fuel for the future. It can be a highly effective medium to store and transfer energy produced by renewable resources such as wind and solar, whose intermittent nature presents challenges to their wide deployment. Its chemical energy can be extracted using a fuel cell to power an electrical engine at very high efficiency, and this process produces virtually no pollution. One key technological challenge for the transformation to hydrogen-based energy is to find a cost effective and efficient way to store hydrogen. A hydrogen storage system for both stationary and mobile applications must possess a number of characteristics, such as high storage capacity, fast kinetics, long cycle life, cost efficiency and safety under normal use. Solid state hydrogen storage has attracted substantial research and development around the world, since it offers higher volumetric and gravimetric capacities than traditional compression and liquefaction. Intense efforts have been directed towards research on boron–nitrogen–hydrogen (BNH) compounds, among which, ammonia borane is the outstanding example. The strong investment in BNH by government agencies, universities, and companies has led to a much improved understanding of boron chemistry, which provides essential guidance in the search for ideal hydrogen storage candidates, as well as interesting applications in other fields.
