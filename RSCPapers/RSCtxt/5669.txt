    , Accepted 16th April 2019First published on 17th April 2019AbstractStructural deterioration and low conductivity are key factors that give rise to severe capacity fading of transition metal oxides as anodes for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). An effective way to overcome this challenge is to construct nanosized metal oxide heterostructures integrated with a 3D nanoarchitectured metal matrix to buffer volume variation, reinforce structural stability and improve electronic conductivity. Herein, a facile and effective underpotential oxidation (UPO) assisted dealloying protocol has been developed successfully to synthesize freestanding monolithic 3D nanoporous copper@1D cuprous oxide nanowire network (3D NPC@1D Cu2O NWN) heterostructures. Based on their dealloying behavior, the evolution law can be well established, sequentially described as “dealloying of (Mn, Cu) accompanying Cu2O NW germination”, “growth of Cu2O NWs accompanying (Mn, Cu) re-dealloying” and “Cu2O NWN coarsening”. Compared to other CuxO-based electrode materials with different structural designs reported in the literature, the unique nanocomposites as an anode for LIBs exhibit far superior Li storage performance including an ultrahigh initial reversible capacity of 2.71 mA h cm−2, good cycling stability with 60.2% capacity retention after 150 cycles (just 0.007 mA h per cm2 per cycle for capacity fading), and excellent rate capability with reversible capacity as high as 1.64 mA h cm−2 after 55 high-rate cycles. This mainly originates from effectively accommodating huge volume changes during charge/discharge processes, providing abundant reaction active sites, shortening electron/ion transport paths, and building a reliable 3D/1D composite nano-configuration without additional binders and conductive agents, indicative of a considerably promising anode candidate for high-performance LIBs.
Introduction
Transition metal oxides have aroused great interest for various applications including field effect transistors,1,2 solar cells,3,4 gas sensors,5–7 catalyst supports,8,9 and so forth. Owing to their unusual multiple oxidation states, outstanding electrochemical performance toward redox reactions can be achieved easily.10–16 Particularly, in recent years, they have been proposed as promising anode materials for LIBs due to their significantly higher theoretical capacities than conventional graphite anodes (just 372 mA h g−1) on the basis of incorporation of more than one Li into them. Notably, Tarascon et al.17 have demonstrated that electrodes made of transition metal oxides exhibit extremely superb electrochemical properties. Among them, copper(I/II) oxide would be especially appealing in LIBs because of their good performance, low cost, natural abundance and environmental friendliness. Despite these advantages, they also suffer from drastic volume changes and poor electronic conductivity during lithiation/delithiation processes, leading to fierce capacity decay.
To resolve these issues, copper oxide nanoparticles with different morphologies and valence/electronic states of copper, such as CuO nanohexagons,18 CuO hollow nanospheres,19 Cu2O nanospheres,20 and Cu2O nanocubes,21 have been developed and studied widely. Although nanoparticles could reduce the diffusion length for Li+ transport and accommodate the mechanical strain during Li insertion/extraction, they still have obvious drawbacks like poor thermodynamic stability and a marked aggregation effect due to a large surface area and high surface energy.22,23 Thus, there could be much room for progress with regard to the development of copper oxide nanostructures, especially in structural design, morphology control and size uniformity, which needs to be investigated deeply.
1D nanostructures have considerable potential as key functional components for LIBs due to their unique and fascinating properties resulting from a distinct migration path and quantum confinement effect,24–26 while a 3D nanoporous architecture as a superior anode support can provide efficient and rapid pathways for Li+/electron transport and short solid-state diffusion lengths.27–29 Rational combination of 1D nanosized metal oxide and a 3D nanoporous metal matrix could generate a huge amount of heterojunctions to yield the novel functions and enhanced properties which cannot be realized simply from each of the components separately.30–33 In particular, the heterojunctions as an anode for LIBs could possess the following main advantages: (1) 1D nanowires (NWs) with large specific area provide abundant active sites for lithiation reactions and short path lengths for Li+/electron transport to facilitate high capacity and rate performance;34 (2) the huge volume change induced by lithiation/delithiation processes can be accommodated and buffered by adequate room within the 3D/1D composite nanoarchitecture;35 (3) homogeneous dispersion of 1D NWs on the 3D nanoporous matrix prevents aggregation of NWs and enhances conductivity due to the partition effect of nanopores and low charge transfer resistance.
Herein, we developed a facile and effective UPO assisted dealloying protocol to synthesize freestanding monolithic 3D NPC@1D Cu2O NWNs by one-step electrochemical dealloying of as-cast Mn 35 at% Cu alloy sheets in an oxygen-containing H2SO4 solution at a potential of −0.2 V(SCE), which is 123 mV(SCE) lower than the critical oxidation potential of Cu metal in the H2SO4 solution. The 1D Cu2O NWNs growing on a 3D NPC matrix in situ can maintain high conductivity and effectively avoid the use of binders and conductive agents, which is currently indispensable in commercial LIBs but inevitably causes a depressed energy density. Compared to other CuxO-based electrode materials with different structural designs reported in the literature, the nanocomposites created by the one-step strategy exhibit far superior Li storage performance including an extraordinarily high specific capacity, good cyclability and excellent rate capability, indicative of a considerably promising candidate for high-performance LIB anodes. The formation mechanism of the unique 3D NPC@1D Cu2O NWNs and their robust application in LIBs have been discussed systematically.
Experimental
A Mn–Cu alloy with a nominal composition of 35 at% Cu was prepared from pure Mn (99.99 wt%) and pure Cu (99.999 wt%). Voltaic arc heating was employed to melt the powder in a copper crucible under an argon atmosphere, and then the melt was cooled down into ingots. The Mn 35 at% Cu ingots were subsequently processed into sheets with a thickness of ca. 200 μm using a low speed wire-cutting electrical discharge machine. Prior to further treatment, the alloy sheets were degreased with acetone, and then ground and mechanically polished with sandpaper and alumina slurry in turn to eliminate oxides formed on the surface during processing and make it become a mirror-like plane. EDX analysis showed that the atomic percentage of Cu and Mn in the initial Mn–Cu alloy was quite close to the designed composition, indicating that the alloy sheets can be further used in the following study (Table S1, ESI†). Then, the Mn 35 at% Cu alloy sheets were electrochemically dealloyed in a 5 wt% H2SO4 aqueous solution without removal of oxygen (called oxygen-containing H2SO4 solution in this work) at RT (ca. 25 °C) at a potential of −0.2 V(SCE) for different durations to obtain the ideal freestanding 3D NPC@1D Cu2O NWNs. After the dealloying, the specimens were rinsed with distilled water and dehydrated alcohol (analytical grade) several times, then dried at 70 °C for 24 h in a vacuum, and eventually kept in a vacuum chamber to avoid further oxidation.
Microstructural characterization and analysis of the initial Mn 35 at% Cu alloy and as-dealloyed nanocomposites were carried out using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/Max-2400) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å), scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800) with an EDX analyzer, transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM 2100F) with selected-area electron diffraction (SAED), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL JEM 2100F).
Potentiodynamic polarization, potentiostatic polarization and cyclic voltammetry (CV) were performed using an electrochemical workstation (PARSTAT 2273) in a standard three-electrode cell (200 mL) with a Pt plate electrode as a counter electrode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as a reference electrode, and a tested metal/alloy (including the as-cast Mn–Cu alloy, metals Mn and Cu for comparison) as the working electrode. All measurements were carried out in solutions exposed to air at RT. The electrolyte was a 5 wt% oxygen-containing H2SO4 solution using analytical-grade reagents and distilled water. The scan rates were 5 mV s−1 for potentiodynamic polarization and 1 mV s−1 for CV measurements, after allowing a steady state potential to develop. A total of 500 cycles of CVs were recorded for the as-cast Mn–Cu alloy. The applied potential for electrochemical dealloying of the as-cast Mn–Cu alloy was determined according to potentiodynamic polarization test results. The amperometric i–t curves were obtained during potentiostatic polarization.
Electrochemical charge–discharge behaviors were investigated in simulant cells assembled with the as-prepared composite anode, lithium foil and Celgard 2300 membrane in an Ar-filled glovebox (MB-10-G with TP170b/mono, MBRAUN). The electrolyte was 1 M LiPF6 in a mixed solution of EC, DEC and DMC (1:1:1 by v/v/v). Each cell was aged for 24 h at RT before commencing the electrochemical tests. The galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements were carried out in a multichannel battery test system (NEWARE BTS-610, Neware Technology Co., Ltd., China) for a cut-off potential of 0.01–3.0 V (vs. Li/Li+) at ambient temperature. The delithiated electrode after repeated cycling was taken out of the cell, washed with ethanol to remove the residual electrolyte and lithium salts and then dried at RT for further SEM characterization. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were recorded between 0.01 and 3.0 V (vs. Li/Li+) at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed in the frequency range of 10 mHz to 100 kHz with an AC voltage amplitude of 5 mV. Both CV and EIS were carried out using a PARSTAT 2273 electrochemical workstation.
Results and discussion
The as-cast Mn 35 at% Cu alloy sheets and as-produced nanocomposites upon the dealloying in the H2SO4 solution at −0.2 V(SCE) for 60 min are characterized by XRD, with typical patterns shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The filled circle, square, and triangle represent (Mn, Cu), Cu and Cu2O, respectively. The Mn 35 at% Cu alloy is composed of single-phase (Mn, Cu) solid solution (Fig. S1a, ESI†). Upon the dealloying, three major diffraction peaks (2θ = 43.3, 50.4 and 74.1°) can be found clearly in the XRD pattern, assigned to the (111), (200) and (220) reflections of face centered cubic (fcc) Cu, respectively. Meanwhile, there also exist two minor diffraction peaks (2θ = 36.5 and 41.6°) corresponding to the (111) reflection of emerged Cu2O and the (111) reflection of residual (Mn, Cu), respectively. Note that other diffraction peaks of Cu2O, such as those at 42.4°, 61.5° and 72.7°, cannot be discerned readily due to its low content and partial overlaps with (111)Cu and (220)Cu reflections. As a result, the as-obtained nanocomposites are mainly composed of Cu and Cu2O phases apart from a little residual (Mn, Cu) precursor, in which Cu is dominant obviously in terms of its high peak intensity (Fig. S1b, ESI†). Fig. 1a schematically illustrates the electrochemical preparation process of the nanocomposites through the one-step UPO assisted dealloying protocol and Fig. 1b–h show their typical plane and cross-sectional microstructures. As can be seen from Fig. 1b, the specimen surface exhibits a uniform porous network with a 3D nanoarchitecture consisting of 1D NWs. The SEM image at a higher magnification further shows that the length scale of a single NW is hundreds of nm but its diameter only ranges from several to a dozen nm (Fig. 1c). Intriguingly, the section view of the nanocomposites shows that these 1D NWs can be anchored well on a nanoporous matrix with a unimodal pore size distribution and a typical SEM image is presented in Fig. 1d. The high-magnification SEM image further exhibits an open, bicontinuous interpenetrating ligament-pore structure, suggesting that the nanoporous substrate is 3D (Fig. 1e). Moreover, the TEM observations also reveal that the superficial 3D porous network configuration is composed of 1D NWs with 15 ± 5 nm diameter and a typical single NW is shown in the inset of Fig. 1f. The SAED pattern corresponding to the single NW shows a typical hexagonal pattern, which is from the cubic Cu2O [110] zone axis, indicating a single crystalline characteristic of the selected target (Fig. 1g). Meanwhile, the lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.245 nm extending throughout the whole NW from the HRTEM image in Fig. 1h further verify the single crystal nature of the 1D Cu2O NW. In addition, EDX analysis shows that both Cu and O can be identified from the surface of nanocomposites (Fig. 1i), while nearly just Cu can be detected from the cross-sectional nanoporous matrix (Fig. 1j), confirming that the 1D NWs on the surface are Cu2O and the nanoporous structure underneath is Cu in combination with the XRD analysis above. Note that the existence of a trace amount of Mn mainly derives from the residual undealloyed (Mn, Cu) precursor, which could be expected to be trapped inside Cu ligaments based upon the established dealloying physical mechanism of solid solution alloys.36,37 Thus, the as-synthesized nanocomposites possess unique freestanding monolithic 3D nanoporous copper supported 1D cuprous oxide nanowire network heterostructures. In stark contrast, no obvious 1D NWs can be observed on the surface of products by chemical dealloying of the as-cast Mn 35 at% Cu alloy under the same conditions (Fig. S2, ESI†), clearly demonstrating that the present one-step electrochemical synthesis protocol developed has an exclusive virtue on constructing reliable 3D/1D composite nano-configuration without additional binders and conductive agents that are currently indispensable in commercial LIBs but inevitably give rise to a markedly reduced energy density.

To reveal the formation mechanism, surface morphology and chemical composition evolutions of the freestanding 3D NPC@1D Cu2O NWN nanocomposites during the dealloying were investigated systematically. Fig. 2a–d display the morphology evolution of 1D Cu2O NWNs on the surface of the 3D NPC matrix during the dealloying. Clearly, with the increase of dealloying duration from 10 to 60 min, smallish grass-like Cu2O NWs emerge uniformly on the surface of the matrix firstly and then continuously grow along the radial and axial directions but their aspect ratio increases sharply, eventually resulting in the in situ formation of 3D NPC@1D Cu2O NWNs (Fig. 2a–c). Subsequently, the 1D NWNs start to agglomerate regionally and coarsen gradually to create some uneven backbones as the dealloying duration reaches as long as 80 min (Fig. 2d). Fig. 2e shows the composition variation of the Mn 35 at% Cu alloy with dealloying duration as measured by EDX. Obviously, three composition regions, denoted by I, II and III, can be distinguished. It can be seen clearly from region I that the atomic percentages of both Mn and Cu alter dramatically, while those counterparts in region II spanning dealloying duration from 10 to 60 min only vary mildly; thereafter, a slighter composition change can be observed in region III. Note that the composition changes little, close to a steady state, as the dealloying duration increases to 80 min.

Stage I: “dealloying of (Mn, Cu) accompanying Cu2O NW germination”. Stage II: “growth of Cu2O NWs accompanying (Mn, Cu) re-dealloying”. Stage III: “Cu2O NWN coarsening”. 
To address this issue in the spirit of exploration, we consider that their formation mechanism could be explained as follows based on a combination of morphology and composition evolutions of the unique nanocomposites, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 2f. Before dealloying, the initial Mn 35 at% Cu alloy is composed of single-phase (Mn, Cu) solid solution. With increasing dealloying duration, the dealloying process can be divided into three stages, signified by stage I, stage II and stage III, respectively. In stage I, the component Mn in the Mn–Cu alloy acting as an anode dissolves preferentially. Typically, the Mn in (Mn, Cu) continuously dissolves into the solution and the remaining Cu atoms will reassemble to form the nanoporous structure through rapid surface diffusion along the alloy/solution interfaces; meanwhile, the dissolved active oxygen radical (˙O) in the corrosive solution can be captured fast by activated Cu atoms on the surface with unsaturated bonds and high surface energy to create the smallish grass-like Cu2O NWs under the action of an external electric field, which is in good agreement with the SEM observations described above. This process could correspond to the dramatic alterations of atomic percentages of both Mn and Cu, as well as the moderate increase of that of O in region I of Fig. 2e due to the dissolution of a large amount of Mn and the generation of a small quantity of Cu2O. Hence, stage I can be identified as “dealloying of (Mn, Cu) accompanying Cu2O NW germination”, corresponding to the initial stage of dealloying. In stage II, the 1D Cu2O NWs grow continually coupled with further evolution of the nanoporous architecture resulting from the gradual exposure and redissolution of Mn in the undealloyed (Mn, Cu) embedded in the Cu ligaments through diffusion and rearrangement of Cu atoms. At this stage, the solution can hardly establish contact with the undealloyed (Mn, Cu) directly but can always establish contact with the Cu2O NWs readily, and as a result, the atomic percentages of both Mn and Cu only vary mildly while that of O increases markedly, suggesting that the growth of 1D Cu2O NWs is predominant relative to nanoporous structure evolution at this moment. The end of this stage is marked by the occurrence of regional agglomeration of 1D Cu2O NWs. It could be defined as the “growth of Cu2O NWs accompanying (Mn, Cu) re-dealloying” stage, corresponding to the composition evolution process in region II of Fig. 2e spanning dealloying duration from 10 to 60 min. In stage III, the uniform 1D Cu2O NWs begin to agglomerate and coarsen locally due to the occurrence of Ostwald ripening from the high mobility of Cu atoms in the acidic solution for a relatively long duration, corresponding to the slight changes in chemical compositions of all components as the dealloying duration exceeds 60 min. It should be noted that the atomic percentages of both Mn and Cu decrease very slowly, accompanied by a corresponding rise in the O concentration, and eventually, a quasi-stable state can be achieved with the dealloying duration up to 80 min. This present result suggests that the regional coarsening of 1D Cu2O NWNs is prominent at this stage, which could be designated as “Cu2O NWN coarsening”. This mechanism may lead to the case that the dealloying of (Mn, Cu) solid solution and the in situ growth of Cu2O NWNs can be achieved simultaneously during the one-step electrochemical dealloying and accounts for the in situ formation of freestanding 3D NPC@1D Cu2O NWNs.

Fig. 3a shows Tafel polarization curves of metals Mn, Cu and as-cast Mn 35 at% Cu alloy in the H2SO4 solution at RT, respectively. It can be found that the critical corrosion potential (Ecorr) of the Mn–Cu alloy is −0.621 V(SCE), which is much greater than that of Mn metal (−1.299 V(SCE)) but far lower than that of Cu metal (−0.077 V(SCE)), indicating that a relatively large difference exists in the metal/metal-ion equilibrium potentials between Mn and Cu, and element Mn is more electroactive. For the initial Mn 35 at% Cu alloy comprising single-phase (Mn, Cu) solid solution, components Mn and Cu existing in the alloy can form a highly effective galvanic cell, in which the Mn acts as an anode to preferentially dissolve accompanying diffusion and rearrangement of Cu atoms along the alloy/solution interfaces to eventually form the 3D NPC matrix with a unimodal pore size distribution. Moreover, it is worthwhile noting that the applied potential for electrochemical dealloying of the as-cast Mn–Cu alloy is −0.2 V(SCE), 123 mV(SCE) lower than the Ecorr value of Cu metal but at which Cu2O NWs can be generated, indicative of the occurrence of oxidation of Cu to Cu2O beneath the critical potential during the electrochemical dealloying. Thus, we herein define this abnormal electrochemical oxidation process as underpotential oxidation (UPO) and name this unique dealloying technique as UPO assisted dealloying. Fig. 3b displays the current density versus duration profile of the as-cast Mn 35 at% Cu alloy dealloyed in the H2SO4 solution at a potential of −0.2 V(SCE). Clearly, with the dealloying duration increasing to 80 min, the corrosion current density declines continuously and presents a distinctly fast–slow–fast–slow four-step tendency. This result can further confirm, from an electrochemical perspective, that the dealloying of the as-cast Mn–Cu alloy includes the Mn dissolution from (Mn, Cu) solid solution, the Cu2O generation, growth and coarsening. Note that as the dealloying duration is less than 30 min, the regular zigzag variation trend of current density can be observed in the magnified inset of Fig. 3b, which is closely related to the typical dynamic competition between dissolution of Mn atoms and diffusion-rearrangement of Cu atoms during dealloying.38Fig. 3c presents the corrosion duration dependence curve of open circuit potential (Eopen) during the electrochemical dealloying; as a reference, the counterpart during the chemical dealloying under the same conditions also was added. Analogously, the Eopen variation also exhibits fast–slow–fast–slow four stages in the whole test range, well consistent with the change tendency of corrosion current density in Fig. 3b. It should be noted that the Eopen during the electrochemical dealloying is always higher than that during the chemical dealloying at any same duration, implying that the content of Cu in the as-dealloyed specimens could be always higher after the electrochemical dealloying for the same duration, which can be rationally explained as a consequence of accelerated dissolution of Mn by the external electric field as an additional driving force. Fig. 3d displays the CVs of the as-cast Mn 35 at% Cu alloy in the H2SO4 solution in the voltage window of −0.65 to −0.3 V(SCE) at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1, in which −0.65 V(SCE) is lower than the Ecorr of (Mn, Cu) solid solution and −0.3 V(SCE) is higher than that but lower than the Ecorr of Cu metal. Also shown are the CVs of metals Mn and Cu for comparison in Fig. 3e–f. Clearly, the CVs of Mn metal have a sharp increase of current density during the forward and reverse scans, while the current density of Cu metal has no obvious change in the whole voltage window. For the CVs of the Mn 35 at% Cu alloy up to 500 cycles, there is a distinct shift from the oblique to the horizontal direction with increasing cycle number, indicating that the CVs of the Mn–Cu alloy evolve gradually from the Mn-type to the Cu-type as the dealloying happens continuously. Therefore, the one-step UPO assisted dealloying technique developed in this work provides a brand-new and highly efficient approach to in situ construct 3D nanostructured metal/oxide composites with broad application prospects in various industries.

The Li storage performance of the unique 3D NPC@1D Cu2O NWNs as an anode for LIBs is discussed systematically in the following section. For a rational comparison, a 2D PC@Cu2O MP electrode (Fig. S3, ESI†) is also introduced in some tests to verify the superiority of the 3D electrode, and can be obtained typically by two-step heat treatment of 2D PC at 550 °C for 1 h under ambient atmosphere and then at 700 °C for 2 h under an Ar atmosphere. Fig. 4a and b show the galvanostatic charge–discharge curves of 3D NPC@1D Cu2O NWN and 2D PC@Cu2O MP electrodes between 0.01 and 3.0 V (vs. Li/Li+) at a constant current density of 0.1 mA cm−1, respectively. For the 3D NPC@1D Cu2O NWN electrode, two obvious discharge plateaus can be observed at 1.7–1.2 V (vs. Li/Li+) and 1.2–0.4 V (vs. Li/Li+) in the first discharge process, which corresponds to the lithiation of Cu2O (Cu2O + 2Li+ +2e− → Li2O + 2Cu) and the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) membrane.39,40 Note that the two plateaus shorten during the subsequent discharge processes compared to the first one, which can be ascribed to the activation of the electrode fully permeated by electrolyte just after the initial discharge process.41 Moreover, a relatively large capacity loss can be found between the first and second discharge processes, which is mainly related to the formation of the SEI causing the irreversible electrolyte decomposition.42,43 Analogously, there also exist two plateaus at 1.1–2.1 V (vs. Li/Li+) and 2.3–2.8 V (vs. Li/Li+) in the initial charge processes, assigned to the decomposition of the SEI and the occurrence of delithiation reaction (Li2O + 2Cu → Cu2O + 2Li+ +2e−), respectively. Except for the initial discharge, the shapes of the charge and discharge curves do not change remarkably afterwards, implying its good capacity retention. This is mainly owing to the plenty of interspace among 1D Cu2O NWNs alleviating the large volume change during charge–discharge processes and the in situ growth of 1D Cu2O NWNs on the 3D NPC matrix suppressing the structural collapse, pulverization and exfoliation happening in active components. Additionally, it is worthwhile noting that the voltage plateau ranges of charge and discharge curves vary little in the first 10 cycles, suggesting the superior structural integrity and cycling stability of the 3D NPC@1D Cu2O NWN electrode.

In contrast, for the 2D PC@Cu2O MP electrode, just a single sloping potential range of 1.3–0.5 V (vs. Li/Li+) can be found in the initial discharge process, which involves both the reduction of Cu2O and the formation of the SEI.44,45 It has been reported that the plateau overlap is likely related to the large Cu2O sizes with typical micron-scale, which can decrease the lithiation potential of Cu2O markedly.44 This is in good agreement with the SEM observations presented in Fig. S3 (ESI†). Intriguingly, like for the 3D structured electrode, two discharge plateaus at 1.5–1.1 V (vs. Li/Li+) and 0.75–0.3 V (vs. Li/Li+) emerged in the second discharge process, indicating that the Cu2O lithiation and SEI formation were happening at different potential ranges, which can be attributed to the typical scale change of Cu2O from micron to nanometer during the initial charge–discharge process, resulting in the lithiation potential shift of Cu2O to the higher one.44,45 Similarly, the initial charge process only has one sloping potential range from 0.7 to 2.5 V (vs. Li/Li+), corresponding to the decomposition of the SEI and the oxidation of Cu to Cu2O.45 It should be noted that all the charge curves of the 2D PC@Cu2O MP electrode show a quite steep change tendency, implying the greater difficulty in the delithiation process of micron-sized Cu2O with less specific area and fewer active sites than those in nanoscale. After the 3rd charge–discharge cycle, no distinct lithiation and delithiation plateaus can still be observed clearly, accompanied by the fast decay of capacity. The charge capacity remains as low as 0.3 mA h cm−2 at the 10th cycle, just with a capacity retention of 35.1%. This is mainly associated with the huge volume variation inducing the cracking, pulverization and detachment of the active material from the current collector during repeated cycling.
To investigate the electrochemical mechanism during charge–discharge processes, the first three-cycle CVs of the 3D NPC@1D Cu2O NWN electrode were measured with a potential range of 0.01–3.0 V (vs. Li/Li+) at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. As shown in Fig. 4c, two broad cathodic peaks can be observed clearly around 1.38 and 0.61 V (vs. Li/Li+), which can be assigned to the reversible conversion of Cu2O to Cu, as well as the formation of the SEI. During the first charge process, the two anodic peaks emerging at 1.67 and 2.72 V (vs. Li/Li+) correspond to the decomposition of the SEI and oxidation of Cu to Cu2O. Note that the peak intensity of SEI formation is relatively larger than that of the decomposition, indicative of the incomplete reaction process. The redox peak positions during the subsequent cycles have little deviation from those of the initial cycle, demonstrating its excellent structural stability and electrochemical reversibility, which is in good accordance with the galvanostatic charge–discharge results presented in Fig. 4a.
In contrast, the initial-cycle CVs of the 2D PC@Cu2O MP electrode differed significantly from the following cycles, as shown in Fig. 4d. Clearly, in the 1st scan, just a single reduction peak can be observed and then it splits into two peaks in the subsequent cathodic scans. It should be noted, however, that two reduction peaks can be obtained directly in the initial cycle of the 3D structured electrode with the typical feature size in the nanoscale, which can effectively raise the Cu2O lithiation potential as well as enlarge the potential difference between Cu2O lithiation and SEI formation in comparison with the conventional micron-sized one.27,46 Additionally, the individual peak intensity and area integral of the 2D PC@Cu2O MP electrode are reduced markedly with increasing cycle number, suggesting that the initial capacity is lost rapidly in a continuous way during the first three cycles. This is correlated with its typical size and structural change during cycling, resulting in the poor structural integrity and stability. Thus, the unique 1D nanostructure design in the 3D electrode is more beneficial for maintaining the structural integrity and stability of Cu2O during cycling relative to the large-sized microparticles in the 2D electrode.
Cycling stability is a key indicator to evaluate the superiority of the electrode. Fig. 4e illustrates the cycle performance of the 3D NPC@1D Cu2O NWN electrode with a potential range of 0.01–3.0 V (vs. Li/Li+) at a current density of 0.1 mA cm−2; meanwhile, the corresponding 2D PC@Cu2O MP electrode is also added for comparison. It is clear that the 3D NPC@1D Cu2O NWN electrode delivered large discharge and charge specific capacities of 4.35 mA h cm−2 and 2.71 mA h cm−2 in the initial cycle, respectively, with a relatively high first coulombic efficiency beyond 62.2%. The reversible capacity retention of the 3D electrode reaches as high as 78.9% after the first 10 cycles and can still be retained beyond 60.2% after 150 cycles, which means just 0.007 mA h per cm2 per cycle for capacity fading. Note that except for the first several cycles, its coulombic efficiency always remains above 95% and no obvious capacity decay occurs in the subsequent elongated cycles, indicative of the superior electrochemical reversibility. Typically, reversible capacities of 1.96, 1.77 and 1.67 mA h cm−2 can be achieved at the 20th, 50th and 120th cycles for the 3D electrode, respectively. Even after 150 cycles, it can still deliver a high reversible capacity of 1.63 mA h cm−2. The outstanding electrochemical properties can be ascribed to the reliable 3D/1D composite nano-configuration design accommodating the huge volume variation and enhancing the loading of the active material. In contrast, the initial discharge and charge capacities of the 2D PC@Cu2O MP electrode are only 2.24 mA h cm−2 and 1.15 mA h cm−2, respectively, with a relatively low coulombic efficiency of 51.3%. In the subsequent cycles, reversible capacities of 0.26, 0.15 and 0.076 mA h cm−2 can be attained for the 2D electrode at the 20th, 50th, 150th cycles, respectively. Obviously, the areal capacity of the 2D PC@Cu2O MP electrode sharply decreases from the beginning and only 6.6% capacity is retained after 150 cycles with coulombic efficiency below 85%. This can be mainly attributed to the close stacking of Cu2O particles and their relatively large feature sizes, which would lead to the rapid cracking, pulverization and detachment of Cu2O from the 2D PC substrate induced by the huge volume change and insufficient stress buffering during the lithiation/delithiation processes. In addition, we give a detailed comparison of lithium storage properties of the 3D NPC@1D Cu2O NWN electrode with other CuxO-based electrode materials reported in the recent literature, as listed clearly in Table S2 (ESI†). Obviously, the 3D electrode as-built via a one-step dealloying route possesses significantly improved cycling ability with higher specific capacity, longer cycle life and more steady coulombic efficiency.
Rate performance is another important consideration. Rate capability profiles of the 3D NPC@1D Cu2O NWN and 2D PC@Cu2O MP electrodes at different current densities were further measured, as displayed in Fig. 4f. Clearly, the 3D electrode can deliver high reversible capacities of 1.12, 0.51 and 0.35 mA h cm−2 at current densities of 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 mA cm−2, respectively. When the current density returns to 0.1 mA cm−2 at the 45th cycle, the reversible capacity increases to 1.73 mA h cm−2, which reveals as high as 93.7% capacity retention compared with the 11th cycle at the same current density. It is worth noting that after undergoing a series of high-rate charge–discharge processes, a reversible capacity of 1.64 mA h cm−2 can still be retained at the 55th cycle, fully demonstrating its excellence for rate performance. This outcome can be attributed to the unique 1D NWN structure with a large specific area and enough interspace, which can not only facilitate better electrolyte infiltration, but can also provide a larger contact area and more active sites for lithiation/delithiation reactions. Meanwhile, the in situ growth of Cu2O NWNs on the 3D NPC matrix (without additional binders and conductive agents) can also reinforce the binding force effectively between the active material and the current collector, withstand the pulverization and detachment of the active material from the current collector caused by the volume change, and shorten the Li+/electron diffusion paths during charge–discharge processes. In contrast, the 2D PC@Cu2O MP electrode can just deliver reversible capacities of 0.10, 0.03 and 0.01 mA h cm−2 at current densities of 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 mA cm−2, respectively. When the current density was reduced to 0.1 mA cm−2 again, the reversible capacity cannot pick up a higher value (namely failure in essence), indicative of its extremely poor rate capability. This is primarily because the repeated huge volume expansion and contraction of Cu2O MPs at the high current density much more easily brings about the rapid cracking, pulverization and exfoliation of the active material as well as the collapse of and severe damage to the electrode configuration.

Fig. 4g–h further exhibit the charge and discharge curves of the 3D NPC@1D Cu2O NWN electrode at various current densities from 0.1 to 1.6 mA cm−2. Obviously, the initial discharge and charge capacity retention is gradually reduced to 83.9%, 69.9% and 94.8%, 82.3% at current densities of 0.2 and 0.4 mA cm−2, respectively. Even as the current density reaches 1.6 mA cm−2, the initial discharge and charge capacity retention still remains as high as 54.1% and 69.4%, confirming its excellent kinetics characteristics. Moreover, with the increase of current densities, both the discharge potential decrease and charge potential increase are not obvious, suggesting a little polarization of the electrode. It can be probably related to the unique 3D/1D composite nano-configuration and the in situ growth of single-crystal Cu2O on the NPC substrate, which can not only provide a favorable conductive environment for the active material, but can also decrease the charge transfer resistance effectively between the active material and the current collector. This will be discussed in detail in the following part.
The ion and electron transport of the 3D NPC@1D Cu2O NWN and 2D PC@Cu2O MP electrodes were investigated by EIS, as depicted in Fig. 4i and j, which is one of the most important ways to reveal the Li+ and electron transport kinetics in LIBs. As indicated in Fig. 4i, both Nyquist plots consist of a semicircle in the high to medium frequency range, the diameter of which represents the charge transfer resistance and an inclined line in the low frequency range closely related to the diffusion coefficient of Li+ inside electrode materials.45,47–49 Note that the 3D electrode has much lower charge transfer resistance (Rct ≈ 40 Ω) at the initial state compared to the 2D electrode (Rct ≈ 600 Ω). It is appealing that the charge transfer resistance of the 3D electrode still has no rapid increase after 50 (Rct ≈ 50 Ω) and 150 cycles (Rct ≈ 100 Ω), suggesting its superior electronic conductivity. In contrast, the diameter of the semicircle in the high to medium frequency range for the 2D electrode abruptly enlarges just after 50 cycles (Rct > 1000 Ω), as presented in Fig. 4j, implying the notably poor kinetics process for Li+ and electron transport. To further understand the results from a quantitative viewpoint, the fitting curves and equivalent circuits of EIS of the 3D NPC@1D Cu2O NWN and 2D PC@Cu2O MP electrodes after 50 cycles were obtained and the results are shown in Fig. 4k–l. As can be seen clearly, the fitting curves are well consistent with the EIS of the 3D and 2D electrodes after 50 cycles. The equivalent circuits used for fitting are shown in the insets of Fig. 4k–l, which consist of corresponding circuit models including the electrolyte resistance Rs, charge transfer resistance Rct, Warburg impedance of Li+ diffusion in the electrode Wo and space charge capacitance at the electrode/electrolyte interface CPE. The present fitting results show that the 3D electrode has much lower Rs (2.0 Ω) and Rct (46.8 Ω) than the 2D electrode (Rs = 7.3 Ω, Rct = 1025.6 Ω), demonstrating that the unique 3D/1D composite nano-configuration is quite beneficial to rapid Li+ diffusion, electron transport and electrode/electrolyte wettability.

Fig. 5 shows the SEM images of the 3D NPC@1D Cu2O NWN and 2D PC@Cu2O MP electrodes after different charge–discharge cycles, respectively. For the 3D structured electrode, no obvious difference in microstructure (morphology, size and distribution) exists before and after cycling, as indicated in Fig. 5a–b. The SEM images at a higher magnification further display the nearly perfect 1D NWN structure clearly as well as the fact that no obvious pulverization and detachment of Cu2O occur from the 3D matrix even after elongated charge–discharge (150) cycles, indicative of its superior structural stability with good binding force between the active material and the 3D matrix. This is mainly due to the reliable 3D/1D composite nano-configuration with much interspace providing ample room for accommodation of volume variation and the in situ growth of the active material on the 3D matrix without additional binders and conductive agents. In clear contrast, the microstructure and surface morphology of the 2D PC@Cu2O MP electrode after cycling are presented in Fig. 5c–d. It can be found readily that the large cracks, severe pulverization and exfoliation of active material can be seen just after 10 cycles, and the complete collapse and disruption of the electrode structure occur after relatively short (50) cycles. This is closely related to the typical size change, large volume expansion and inadequate stress buffering during repeated charge–discharge processes. Note that the present findings are quite different from its original state in Fig. S3 (ESI†). Additionally, the stress distributions of the 2D and 3D electrodes after Li+ insertion reaction can be evaluated further by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, as displayed in Fig. 5e–h. Evidently, the relatively large stress concentration and poor structural integrity can be identified in the 2D electrode after Li+ insertion, which would undoubtedly cause the failure of the electrode more easily compared to the 3D one (see the ESI† for detailed MD analysis, Note 1). Therefore, both the experimental and simulation results clearly demonstrate that the 2D planar configuration cannot buffer the huge volume variation enough during repeated lithiation/delithiation processes (especially at high rates), eventually giving rise to the terrible electrochemical performance.

Compared to the conventional 2D electrode, the unique 3D NPC@1D Cu2O NWN electrode, fabricated by a one-step UPO assisted dealloying protocol, shows far superior Li storage performance (ultrahigh specific capacity, good cycling stability and excellent rate capability), which can be ascribed to the following four main aspects. (1) 1D Cu2O NWNs with large specific area and good permeability can provide ideal conditions for electrolyte diffusion and abundant active sites for lithiation reaction to achieve high specific capacity. (2) The reliable 3D/1D composite nano-configuration with much interspace can effectively accommodate the huge volume variation and mechanical strain during repeated charge–discharge processes, resulting in good cycling stability. (3) The in situ growth of single-crystal Cu2O NWs on the NPC matrix with good conductivity can markedly enhance the binding force and reduce the charge transfer resistance between the active material and the current collector to yield excellent rate capability. (4) The freestanding monolithic structure without additional binders and conductive agents can ensure excellent structural integrity, prevent the electrode from pulverization and fragmentation, and improve the energy and power densities as it is assembled into cells. Therefore, this work has significant implication for rational design and preparation of promising nanoporous metal/oxide composite anode candidates towards practical application in high-performance LIBs.
Conclusions
In summary, we develop a facile and effective UPO assisted dealloying protocol to synthesize freestanding monolithic 3D NPC@1D Cu2O NWNs by one-step electrochemical dealloying of as-cast Mn 35 at% Cu alloy in an oxygen-containing H2SO4 solution at a potential of −0.2 V(SCE). With the structural evolution of the 3D nanoporous matrix during dealloying, smallish grass-like Cu2O NWs can be generated on the surface of NPC firstly and they then continuously grow along the radial and axial directions, eventually resulting in the in situ formation of 3D NPC@1D Cu2O NWNs. Their formation mechanism can be well established based on morphology and composition evolution during the dealloying, and includes three typical stages, sequentially described as “dealloying of (Mn, Cu) accompanying Cu2O NW germination”, “growth of Cu2O NWs accompanying (Mn, Cu) re-dealloying” and “Cu2O NWN coarsening”. Compared to other CuxO-based electrode materials reported in the literature, the unique nanocomposites as an anode for LIBs exhibit superior Li storage performance, such as ultrahigh specific capacity, good cyclability and excellent rate capability, which can be attributed to accommodation of the huge volume variation during repeated cycling, availability of abundant active sites for lithiation/delithiation reactions, shortening of the electron/ion transport paths inside the electrode, and construction of a reliable 3D/1D composite nano-configuration without the use of additional binders and conductive agents, indicative of a promising metal oxide based composite anode candidate for next-generation LIBs.
