    , Accepted 12th January 2018First published on 29th January 2018AbstractTwo new hole transporting materials (HTMs) based on triphenylamine and carbazole core moieties are designed and applied in planar perovskite solar cells. 18.2% power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been achieved, and 84% of the initial performance can be retained after 50 days.
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted worldwide attention for dramatically increasing in efficiency over the past few years.1,2 So far, 22.1% certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been obtained, basically comparable to that of conventional CdTe and CIGS thin film photovoltaics.2 A typical conventional PSC consists of a conductive substrate, electron transporting layer (ETL), perovskite layer, hole transporting layer (HTL), and back electrode (Au).3 HTLs or hole transporting materials (HTMs) are an essential component for efficient PSCs due to their effective hole extraction/collection ability and interfacial modification to block the electron transfer from perovskites to the metal anode.4 Current state-of-the-art HTMs are commercially available PTAA (polytriarylamine) and spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene), both of which exhibited over 22% PCE.2,5 However, their complicated synthetic routes and high price are still a big obstacle for their scalable production and practical application.6 Obviously, developing new low-cost, easy-to-get HTM alternatives for highly efficient PSCs is imperative.
Ideal HTMs need to have high hole mobility, a suitable highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level, and stable chemical/physical properties.7 So far, different kinds of HTMs have been trialled in PSCs, including p-type inorganic semiconductors (i.e. CuI, CuOx, CuSCN, V2O5 and NiO),8 polymeric HTMs (i.e. P3HT, poly(TPD))9, and small molecular HTMs (i.e. swivel-cruciform thiophene, tetrathiafulvalene derivatives etc.).10 Amongst these, small molecular HTMs have attractive advantages due to their easy purification and good film-forming ability. Typically, different building blocks (i.e. triphenylamine, pyrene, 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene, linear π-conjugated structure, carbazole, spiro[fluorene-9,90-xanthene] (SFX) and triazines) can be employed as cores to obtain varied structures, i.e. linear, star-shaped, and four-armed structures. HTMs based on triphenylamine (TPA) or carbazole as core moieties have been widely studied because of their simple structures, easy functionalization to adjust optoelectronic properties, good photochemical stability, and low price. Meng and Li et al. designed a series of triphenylamine-based HTMs for PSCs with 13% PCE.11 Sun and Hagfeldt et al. reported a 17.45% PCE for a PSC based on carbazole-based HTM X25 and a 19.8% PCE for a PSC based on SFX-based HTM X59.12 Li et al. designed a butterfly-shaped TPA-based HTM, the devices of which exhibited over 16% PCE.13 However, the cell performance of reported PSCs based on TPA or carbazole moieties is still unsatisfactory in comparison to spiro-OMeTAD-based devices.5 Therefore, much more effort is still needed (1) to continuously develop new HTMs and (2) to deeply understand the relationship between the chemical structures of HTMs and the device performance, which can further help us to design high efficiency HTMs.
In this respect, two new HTMs based on carbazole and TPA core moieties denoted as dly-1 and dly-2, have been designed and applied in planar (FAPbI3)0.75(MAPbI3)0.17(MAPbBr3)0.08-based PSCs, as shown in Scheme 1. Up to 18.2% PCE has been achieved under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2). Besides this, the PSCs exhibit good stability, and can maintain 85% of the initial performance after 50 days, which is better than that of conventional spiro-OMeTAD-based devices.
 Scheme 1  Molecular structures and synthetic routes of dly-1 and dly-2. 
The synthetic method and detailed experimental procedure for the two HTMs are shown in Scheme 1 and the ESI.†14 The as-prepared HTMs are finally obtained by a simple palladium-catalyzed C–N coupling reaction. The molecular structures of the as-prepared HTMs are confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. Their UV-visible absorption spectra in dichloromethane solution and thin film states are shown in Fig. 1a. We can see that there are several absorption bands at wavelengths ranging from 250 to 500 nm. For dly-1, its main absorption peak at 304 nm and a weak peak at 366 nm are assigned to the π → π* transition of the π-conjugation system; however, for dly-2, similar peaks are shifted to 306 and 346 nm, respectively. In the film states, the maximum absorption peak positions are slightly red-shifted, suggesting no obvious aggregation is found for the two thin films. Besides this, the two samples have little light absorption in the range of 400–900 nm, which will not strongly influence the visible light utilization of associated devices. In terms of the absorption spectra of thin films and the relationship of Eg = 1240/λ, the bandgaps of the two HTMs are estimated to be 1.88 and 2.26 eV, respectively. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra in dichloromethane further present the maximum emission peak at 402.8 nm for dly-1 and 396.2 nm for dly-2, with a relatively small Stokes shift of ∼50 nm, indicating no significant change in their geometrical configuration even upon excitation (see the inset of Fig. 1a). As we know, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of the HTM is important in determining whether the material is suitable for hole transfer from the perovskite to the HTM. Here, the HOMO level is −4.93 eV for dly-1 and −4.88 eV for dly-2, determined by differential pulsed voltammetry (DPV), as shown in Fig. 1b. These HOMO levels of dly-1 and 2 basically match with the valence band of the perovskite (−5.65 eV) and the work function of the Au counter electrode, which are energetically favourable for hole transfer at the interface. In the meantime, based on the relationship of ELUMO = EHOMO + Eg, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level value is calculated to be −3.05 eV for dly-1 and −2.62 eV for dly-2. As presented in Fig. 1c, the LUMO levels of our new HTMs are higher than the conduction band of the perovskite (−4.05 eV), indicating that undesired photo-generated electron back transfer from the perovskite to the Au electrode can be effectively inhibited. Obviously, two more triphenylamine arms on the carbazole groups can have an obvious impact on absorption and the energy levels.

In order to evaluate the hole mobility of the two HTMs, a hole-only device with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/HTM/Au is fabricated by using a space charge limited current (SCLC) method, and J–V characteristics are studied in the dark. Hole mobility is estimated by using Mott-Gurney's equation, J = 9εrε0μhV2/8L3, where εr is the relative dielectric constant of the transport medium (εr = 3 for organic materials), ε0 is the permittivity of free space (8.85 × 10−12 C V−1 m−1), L is the thickness of the HTM layer, μh is the hole mobility, and V is the voltage drop through the device.15 Here, L is 20 nm for both dly-1 and dly-2, determined by a surface profiler (KLA-Tencor). The hole mobilities of doped dly-1 and dly-2 are estimated to be 4.59 × 10−4 and 1.42 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, but are still lower than that of optimised spiro-OMeTAD (doped, 1.267 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1) (see Fig. S1 and details in the ESI†).16 Besides this, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is used to evaluate the thermal stability of the as-prepared HTMs. The decomposition temperatures (Td) of the two HTMs are about 300 °C, as shown in Fig. 1d. Obviously, the two samples exhibit good thermal stability, which is important in improving the thermal stability of the device.
The as-prepared HTMs are further employed to fabricate a planar n-i-p configuration PSC consisting of a 20 nm-thick TiO2 compact layer, a ∼300 nm-thick perovskite layer, a thin HTM layer, and an 80 nm-thick Au electrode, as seen in Fig. 2a and b.17 Due to the poor solubility of dly-2 in chlorobenzene or dichlorobenzene, the concentration of the two HTM samples in chlorobenzene for the hole transporting layer in our PSCs is 10 mg mL−1. Additionally, some LiTFSI (bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt) and TBP (4-tert-butyl pyridine) as additives are involved in the HTM solutions.15 Therefore, it is hard to determine the HTM film thickness by a SEM image. For comparison, the same concentration of spiro-OMeTAD is also used. The (FAPbI3)0.75(MAPbI3)0.17(MAPbBr3)0.08-based perovskite layer is prepared by a one-step anti-solvent method, using a precursor solution of 1.32 M PbI2, 0.12 M PbBr2, 1.08 M FAI, 0.24 M MAI, and 0.12 M MABr in DMF/DMSO mixed solvent (v:v = 4:1).18 A smooth compact perovskite film with 200–400 nm grains is obtained (see Fig. 2c). When the perovskite film is coated by our new HTM layers, slightly blurred surfaces can be seen, as shown in Fig. 2d and e. In the meantime, a uniformly smooth morphology of thin HTM films is observed. However, with the dly-2 film, due to its poor solubility, some small, undissolved dly-2 particles are found to be uniformly distributed on the perovskite film surface. The whole device preparation is fully described in the ESI.† The photovoltaic characteristics of PSCs based on the two HTMs and the spiro-OMeTAD are investigated under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2), for which photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves are presented in Fig. 3a and photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. In our I–V characterisation, the hysteresis effect of the devices is also observed (Table S1, ESI†), and reverse scanning J–V curves (from open circuit to short circuit) are adopted. We can see that, with dly-1, the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of the PSC is obviously lower than that of the dly-2 based device. As high as 18.23% PCE has been achieved for dly-2 based PSCs, with Jsc of 23.24 mA cm−2, Voc of 1038.9 mV, and FF of 0.755, which is slightly higher than the dly-1 based device with 17.19% PCE. Furthermore, incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of PSCs with dly-1 and dly-2 are also given in Fig. 3b. The calculated photocurrent densities obtained from the integral of the IPCE spectra are 21.42 mA cm−2 for dly-1 and 22.18 mA cm−2 for dly-2, in good agreement with the experimental data. For comparison, the device based on spiro-OMeTAD with a concentration of 10 mg mL−1 is also fabricated, and it exhibits 16% PCE with Jsc of 23.39 mA cm−2 (integrated photocurrent density is 22.05 mA cm−2), Voc of 980.3 mV, and FF of 0.698 (Fig. S2 and S3, ESI†). It is thus suggested that, under the same concentration, our new HTMs exhibit better photovoltaic performance than the device with spiro-OMeTAD, but it is still lower than that based on a concentration of 73 mg mL−1, as previously reported (19.59%)5 (see Table 1 and Fig. 3a). The statistical box chart of the PCE of 25 devices with the two new HTMs is given in Fig. 3c, and the average PCE of the devices based on dly-1 and dly-2 is 15.90% and 16.5%, respectively, which further confirms that dly-2 can exhibit better cell performance than dly-1. Furthermore, the devices without encapsulation were stored in the dark at room temperature under about 30 RH% for evaluation of their stability, during which J–V characteristics were tested every five or six days over 50 days. As can be seen in Fig. 3d, for the spiro-OMeTAD based PSC, about 50% of their initial PCE is retained after 50 days. The exact reaction is unclear, but it may have originated from the deterioration of the interfaces.19 However, for the as-prepared HTM-based systems, 84% of their initial PCE can be retained after 50 days, suggesting better device stability at room temperature under a condition of about 30 RH%. Preliminary thermal stability tests further reveal that the three devices can efficiently retain the cell performance after being kept at 50 °C in a glove box for 120 min, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3d.

In order to evaluate the hole extraction capability of the as-prepared HTMs, time-resolved transient photoluminescence (PL) spectra are studied. All the samples are fabricated by depositing the HTMs on the top of Al2O3/perovskite layers (∼100 nm-thick Al2O3 films were obtained by spin-coating Al2O3 nanoparticle-based paste on FTO glass, Al2O3 particle size is 20 nm). Here, the introduction of a HTM as a quenching layer will further facilitate the hole extraction in the perovskite at the interface, as shown in Fig. 4a. Obviously, the faster the photo-generated hole extraction in the perovskite film is, the shorter the decay time is.17 By fitting the spectra using a bi-exponential mode, decay times are estimated: for dly-1, τ1 = 6.63 ns and τ2 = 55.17 ns, while for dly-2, a relatively longer decay time is obtained, with τ1 = 9.56 ns and τ2 = 85.71 ns. It is thus suggested that dly-2 exhibits better hole extraction ability than dly-1. Impedance spectra (IS) are given in Fig. 4b to further understand the influence of the HTMs on carrier recombination processes. The plots are fitted by the equivalent circuit (Fig. S4, ESI†).19 Generally, the arc is due to the contribution of the recombination resistance (Rrec) and the chemical capacitance of TiO2/perovskite/HTM interfaces.11,20 In our work, the Rrec value increases in the sequence of: dly-1 (323.4 Ω cm2), spiro-OMeTAD (513.9 Ω cm2), dly-2 (695 Ω cm2). As the other influencing factors of our PSCs are identical except for using different HTMs, a larger Rrec means the interface with dly-2 can remarkably restrain the carrier recombination better than those of dly-1 and low-concentration spiro-OMeTAD, thus exhibiting better cell performance.

Two new hole transporting materials based on triphenylamine and carbazole core moieties have been designed and prepared. It is found that the triphenylamine arms have an obvious impact on absorption and the energy levels. These two HTMs have suitable energy levels basically matching the valence band of the perovskite, efficient hole extraction, and electron blocking capabilities, all of which are suitable for their application in planar (FAPbI3)0.75(MAPbI3)0.17(MAPbBr3)0.08-based solar cells. 18.2% power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been achieved, and the device can retain over 80% of the initial performance after 50 days, which is better than corresponding spiro-OMeTAD-based devices (50%), due to its better hydrophobic nature. Besides this, the devices also exhibit good thermal stability after being kept at 50 °C in a glove box for 120 min. This work demonstrates the potential alternatives for efficient PSCs with improved stability.
