    , Accepted 13th October 2019First published on 16th October 2019AbstractHere we designed and synthesized a new small molecule donor DRC4TB with an alkylthiothienyl-substituted benzodithiophene as the core and 3-butyl rhodanine as the terminal group, which showed an optical bandgap of 1.87 eV. DRC4TB was compatible with both a fullerene acceptor (PC71BM) and an unfused-ring nonfullerene acceptor (HF-PCIC). The optimized DRC4TB:PC71BM and DRC4TB:HF-PCIC solar cells delivered comparable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 8.53% and 8.68%, respectively.
Solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs), containing a photoactive blend film of a p-type donor and an n-type acceptor, have attracted considerable attention due to their noteworthy advantages, including light weight, low cost, flexibility and potential to realize large-scale fabrication.1–6 Fullerene derivatives have been the most dominant acceptors in OSCs for a long time due to their excellent electron mobility, high electron affinity, and easy formation of appropriate phase separation with donor materials.7–12 Meanwhile, tremendous efforts have been devoted to the development of nonfullerene acceptors, especially small molecule acceptors (SMAs), due to their merits such as strong light-harvesting capability and easily tuned energy levels compared with fullerene derivatives, and great progress has been made. For example, many excellent fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) have been reported, such as ITIC,13 Y6,14etc.,15–24 which possess strong and broad absorption in the visible-near infrared wavelength range and high charge mobilities. Besides, simple unfused-ring electron acceptors have also been developed rapidly due to their merits of easier synthesis compared to fused-ring acceptor (NFAs).25–32 The PCEs of nonfullerene organic solar cells with polymer donors have surpassed 14%.14,16,33–38 However, the development of nonfullerene OSCs based on small molecule donors is still lagging behind.39–48
Compared to conjugated polymers, small molecules possess some unique advantages, such as easy purification, well-defined molecular structure, easier energy level control, and high reproducibility.49 PCEs over 10% were achieved for fullerene-based small molecule organic solar cells (FSM-OSCs)7,9,50,51 and nonfullerene all-small-molecule solar cells (NFASM-OSCs).39–48 However, up to now, only a few small molecule donors have been reported which could work well with both fullerene acceptors and nonfullerene small-molecule acceptors.46,52–54 For example, Chen and coworkers reported an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A)-type small molecule named DRCN5T,51 for which high PCEs of 10.08% and 9.89% were obtained for the PC71BM- and the nonfullerene F-2Cl-based devices, respectively.46 Zhang and coworkers reported an A–π–D–π–A-type small molecule DRBDT-TVT, and PCEs of 6.87% and 6.63% were obtained for DRBDT-TVT:PC71BM- and DRBDT-TVT:IDIC-based devices, respectively. Such A–D–A- or A–π–D–π–A-type small molecule donors with wide- or medium-bandgaps could be an effective way to construct more versatile small molecule donors.
The benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) moiety has been widely used in the construction of both conjugated polymer and small molecule donors due to its symmetric and planar structure and moderate electron-donating property.55 Furthermore, the π-electrons could be delocalized onto side chains for two-dimensional dithiophene-substituted BDT (BDTT), which is conductive to the enhancement of π–π stacking and charge transfer as well as better absorption. For instance, Hou and coworkers reported the polymer donor PBDB-T with BDTT as the electron-donating units and PBDB-T-based nonfullerene OSCs show excellent photovoltaic performance (>14%).14,16,33,35 In the case of small molecule donors, Sun and coworkers reported a BDTT-based small molecule donor named BTR.56 Then Zhu and coworkers fabricated ternary devices by using a combination of BTR with PC71BM and nonfullerene acceptor NITI and a high PCE of 13.63% was achieved.57
Noncovalent intramolecular interactions, such as S⋯X (X = N, O, halide) interactions, can be used to restrict the rotation of the neighbouring single bonds and enhance the coplanarity of the un-fused conjugated backbone, which could further promote the exciton diffusion and charge transport of devices. On the other hand, the un-fused structure can be easily synthesized and the corresponding small molecules also show good co-planarity, strong crystallinity and high charge carrier mobility.58–61 Furthermore, thiophene-(p-alkoxybenzene)-thiophene (TBT) moiety based small molecules show good photovoltaic performance due to their high absorption efficiency, proper energy levels, and good morphology.25,40 We here design and synthesize a new small molecule donor DRC4TB, with 4,8-bis(5-((2-ethylhexyl)thio)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (SBDTT) as the central unit, 2,2′-(2,5-bis((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)-1,4-phenylene)dithiophene (TBT) as the π-spacer, and 3-butylrhodanine as the end-capping electron-withdrawing group, and its chemical structure is shown in Fig. 1a. DRC4TB exhibits a medium optical bandgap of 1.87 eV. DRC4TB could work well with both PC71BM and the unfused-ring electron acceptor HF-PCIC,27 and best PCEs of 8.53% for FSM-OSCs and 8.68% for NFASM-OSCs were obtained, respectively. The NFASM-OSCs showed higher short-circuit current density (Jsc) than the FSM-OSCs, which was attributed to the complementary absorption between DRC4TB and HF-PCIC in the range 400–800 nm. To the best of our knowledge, DRC4TB is among the very few small molecule donors that can produce a PCE of over 8.50% in both fullerene and nonfullerene solar cells.46 Notably, the PCE is the highest value for the NFASM-OSCs with unfused-ring core nonfullerene acceptors.

The synthetic route of DRC4TB and detailed procedures are presented in the ESI.† DRC4TB could be obtained via a Stille cross coupling reaction and Knoevenagel condensation within a few steps. The chemical structures of the intermediates and target molecules were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and mass spectroscopy (Fig. S1–S9, ESI†). DRC4TB shows good solubility in common solvents, such as dichloromethane, chloroform, and chlorobenzene. The thermal properties of DRC4TB were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements, and the plots are shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†). DRC4TB possesses good thermal stability with a decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss) of 368 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. S10a, ESI†). A clear melting peak at 257 °C upon heating and a recrystallization peak at 229 °C upon cooling for DRC4TB could be observed in the DSC curves, indicating that DRC4TB has strong crystallinity (Fig. S10b, ESI†).
The UV-vis absorption spectra of DRC4TB in chloroform solution and thin film are illustrated in Fig. 1b, together with the absorption spectra of the acceptors HF-PCIC and PC71BM for comparison. In solution, DRC4TB exhibits strong absorption in the region 300–600 nm with a maximum absorption peak at 518 nm and the maximum extinction efficient is 1.40 × 105 M−1 cm−1. From solution to the solid state, the absorption spectrum is significantly broadened and red-shifted with a maximum at 604 nm, and a shoulder peak at 560 nm appears, indicative of effective intermolecular π–π stacking. The optical bandgap for DRC4TB was calculated to be 1.87 eV from the absorption edge. As shown in Fig. 1b, the absorption of the DRC4TB film and HF-PCIC film are complementary in the region 400–800 nm, which would be beneficial to obtain high Jsc. In contrast, PC71BM exhibits poor absorption in the visible region.
Cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed to study the electrochemical properties of DRC4TB by using a saturated calomel electrode as the reference and Fc/Fc+ (4.8 eV below the vacuum level) as the internal standard (Fig. S11, ESI†). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level calculated from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials were −5.25 and −3.21 eV, respectively. The electrochemical bandgap of DRC4TB was 2.04 eV. From Fig. 1c, the energy levels between DRC4TB and the two acceptors were suitable to construct OSCs and the driving force was large enough for charge separation. Theoretical calculations using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level were also performed to evaluate the electron density distribution of the frontier molecular orbitals and the molecular geometries of DRC4TB (Fig. S12, ESI†). The electron density of the HOMO level is mainly delocalized on the central unit and π-spacers, while the electron density of the LUMO level mainly populates the end-capping groups and π-spacers. DRC4TB shows small dihedral angles (<10°) between all adjacent units, which indicates the relatively high planarity of the molecules.
Normal devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/DRC4TB:acceptor/PFN-Br/Ag utilizing HF-PCIC or PC71BM as the acceptors were fabricated to evaluate the photovoltaic performance of DRC4TB, where PFN-Br is an effective electron transporting layer developed by Huang62 and its structure is shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†). The typical current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the OSCs are displayed in Fig. 2a and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The detailed optimization processes are shown in the ESI.† For the nonfullerene-based devices, the best performance was achieved with a donor/acceptor (D/A) weight ratio of 1.5:1 together with thermal annealing (TA) treatment. The as-cast devices gave a poor PCE of 0.62% with a moderate open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.94 V and a very low Jsc of 2.41 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.27. After TA treatment, the PCE was sharply enhanced to 8.68% accompanied by a significantly improved Jsc of 15.51 mA cm−1 and FF of 0.62. The improvement of the Jsc and FF was closely associated with the better developed morphology and matched charge mobility between the donor and acceptor as discussed below. In the case of the fullerene-based devices, conditions of a D/A weight ratio of 1:0.8 and solvent vapor annealing (SVA) treatment delivered the optimal performance. For the as-cast devices, a PCE of 4.73% was obtained with a high Voc of 1.00 V, a Jsc of 10.85 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.51. After SVA treatment, the PCE was improved to 8.53% with a Jsc of 13.16 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.69. The higher Voc of the fullerene-based devices was derived from the higher LUMO energy level of PC71BM than that of HF-PCIC. However, the nonfullerene-based devices showed higher Jsc than the fullerene-based devices, which was ascribed to the complementary absorption between DRC4TB and HF-PCIC in the range 400–800 nm. The fullerene- and nonfullerene-based devices presented comparable PCEs, which demonstrated that the small molecule donor DRC4TB was compatible with both the fullerene and the nonfullerene acceptors.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices under different conditions are illustrated in Fig. 2b. The nonfullerene-based devices show a broader EQE response in the long wavelength range compared with their fullerene-based counterparts due to the absorption of HF-PCIC, which led to the higher Jsc. For the nonfullerene devices, the as-cast device shows a very low photo response. After TA treatment, the EQE values are significantly enhanced in the whole wavelength range of absorption. For the fullerene-based devices, the EQE values are slightly improved after SVA treatment. The calculated Jcalc from the EQE curves was 12.92 and 15.17 mA cm−2 for the optimal fullerene- and nonfullerene-based devices, respectively, which were consistent with the measured values from the J–V curves within acceptable errors of 5%.
To further study the charge generation, collection and recombination behaviours for both optimal devices, the photocurrent density (Jph) as a function of effective voltage (Veff) is plotted in double logarithmic coordinates as shown in Fig. 2c. The Jph/Jsat ratio can be employed to evaluate the overall exciton separation and charge collection efficiency and Jsat is estimated when Veff ∼ 2.0 V for both devices. Under short-circuit conditions, the Jph/Jsat ratios are 92% for the nonfullerene devices and 93% for the fullerene-based devices, respectively, which suggest that the exciton dissociation process is highly efficient in both devices. At maximal power output conditions, the Jph/Jsat ratios are 69% for the nonfullerene devices and 67% for the fullerene-based devices, respectively, which indicate slightly higher charge collection efficiency for the nonfullerene devices. Furthermore, light intensity (Plight)-dependent measurements of Jsc and Voc were conducted. Jsc as a function of light intensity is shown in Fig. S14 (ESI†), and the fitted linear lines can be described as Jsc ∝ Pαlight, in which the α value represents the degree of charge recombination.63 The closer to 1 the value of α is, the less charge recombination there is. It was found that the α values of the two optimal devices are over 0.99, indicating that there is little charge recombination for both devices. The dependence of Voc on the light intensity (Plight) is shown in Fig. 2d. The slope of Vocversus the natural logarithm of the light intensity gives 2kT/q (where q is the elementary charge, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the Kelvin temperature) implying that trap-assisted recombination dominates the recombination mechanisms.64,65 The slope values of the fullerene- and nonfullerene-based devices are 1.14kT/q and 1.45kT/q, respectively, which suggest more trap-assisted recombination in the nonfullerene-based devices and thus relatively lower charge carrier mobility and lower FF.
The thermal stability of the OSCs was tested and the results are shown in Fig. S15 (ESI†). After heating at 80 °C for 32 h in a glove box, the nonfullerene-based devices kept about 80% of their initial PCEs. However, the PCEs of the fullerene-based devices reduced to ∼70% of their initial values. The result demonstrated that the nonfullerene-based devices exhibited better thermal stability than their fullerene counterparts.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to investigate the morphology of the active layers (Fig. 3). The AFM images revealed that all the blend films showed a smooth surface without severe aggregation. The as-cast and TA-treated DRC4TB:HF-PCIC blend films showed surface root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of 0.39 and 1.17 nm, respectively (Fig. 3a and b). The as-cast and SVA-treated DRC4TB:PC71BM blend films showed RMS roughness values of 0.44 and 0.52 nm, respectively (Fig. 3c and d). The increased RMS roughness indicated that the crystallinity and phase separation were enhanced after optimization. From the TEM images, the as-cast DRC4TB:HF-PCIC blends showed no obvious phase separation. After TA treatment, clear phase separation and an interpenetrating network with well-defined nanofibrils could be observed (Fig. 3e and f). Similarly, for the DRC4TB:PC71BM blends, obvious phase separation formed after SVA treatment (Fig. 3g and h). The good interpenetrating network of the donor/acceptor in the blend films was helpful for exciton dissociation and charge transport, and therefore Jsc, the FF and the PCEs were significantly improved.

Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was further employed to investigate the morphology of the blend films along with the neat materials.66,67 The neat DRC4TB film showed a strong (100) lamellar peak at 0.38 Å−1 (d = 16.5 Å) in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction whereas the neat HF-PCIC and PC71BM showed no obvious lamellar peak in both directions (Fig S16, ESI†). As depicted in Fig. 4, the as-cast DRC4TB:HF-PCIC blends showed weaker scattering intensity compared to the neat DRC4TB films, indicating that the acceptor decreased its crystallinity. After TA treatment, the DRC4TB:HF-PCIC blends showed enhanced peaks at 0.40 Å−1 (d = 15.7 Å) in the OOP direction and at 0.36 Å−1 (d = 17.4 Å) in the in-plane (IP) direction. In the case of the fullerene-based blends, enhanced peaks at 0.40 Å−1 (d = 15.7 Å) in the OOP direction and at 0.37 Å−1 (d = 17.0 Å) in the IP direction were observed after SVA treatment, which illustrated the higher crystallinity of the films. Furthermore, both the fullerene- and nonfullerene-based blends showed enhanced crystallinity, which would be beneficial for charge transport and thus enhanced Jsc and FF.

The hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) of the blend films were tested by the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method (Fig. S17 and Table S7, ESI†). Without any treatment, μh and μe for the DRC4TB:HF-PCIC and DRC4TB:PC71BM devices were 0.06 × 10−4/0.47 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (μh/μe = 0.04) and 0.67 × 10−4/1.15 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (μh/μe = 0.58), respectively. After optimization, μh and μe for the DRC4TB:HF-PCIC and DRC4TB:PC71BM devices were 0.13 × 10−4/0.12 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (μh/μe = 1.08) and 2.39 × 10−4/3.27 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (μh/μe = 0.73), respectively. Overall, both devices showed enhanced and more balanced hole/electron mobilities, which contributed to their improved FFs after optimization. Besides, the charge mobilities of the DRC4TB:HF-PCIC devices without/with treatment were lower than those of the DRC4TB:PC71BM devices, which was partially responsible for their lower FF.
In conclusion, a medium-bandgap small molecule DRC4TB was designed and synthesized, which presented strong absorption in the region 300–650 nm. The photovoltaic performance of FSM-OSCs and NFASM-OSCs using DRC4TB as the donor was systematically investigated. The optimal FSM-OSCs and NFASM-OSCs showed PCEs of 8.53% and 8.68%, respectively. The fullerene-based devices exhibited relatively higher Voc and FF due to the high-lying LUMO energy level of PC71BM and higher charge carrier mobilities. The nonfullerene-based devices showed higher Jsc, which was because the absorption of DRC4TB was complementary to that of HF-PCIC. Besides, suitable phase separation, better donor/acceptor interpenetrating networks and enhanced crystallinity were formed for both the DRC4TB:HF-PCIC and DRC4TB:PC71BM blend films after optimization. Our research demonstrated that medium-bandgap small-molecule donors can work well with different types of acceptors in high-performance small-molecule organic solar cells. In addition, the easy synthesis of both the donor and acceptor may become a new choice for constructing NFASM-OSCs with unfused-ring core acceptors instead of their fused-ring counterparts.
