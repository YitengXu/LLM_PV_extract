    AbstractA series of thienyl-substituted methanofullerenes as electron acceptors for bulk-heterojuction solar cells with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) were synthesized and characterized with respect to electrochemical and photophysical properties. The first one-electron reduction potentials of the higher adducts are shifted toward more negative values by ∼100 mV as compared to the monoadduct. As a result, the solar cells composed of the bisadduct (2) and trisadduct exhibit a larger open-circuit voltage (Voc) than the solar cell composed of P3HT and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), as they have higher LUMO energy levels. Photophysical studies on spin-coated films by femtosecond laser flash photolysis indicate that ultrafast electron transfer from the P3HT donor polymer to all of the fullerene derivatives occurs to form the bound radical pair (BRP) state. No decay of the BRP state of P3HT:thienyl-substituted monoadduct (1) films was observed in the time range of 3 ns. The AFM investigation on P3HT:1 and P3HT:higher adduct films after thermal annealing showed fine donor and acceptor domains and larger domains, respectively. The bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells based on P3HT:1 exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.97%, which is comparable with that of the P3HT:PCBM cell. The P3HT:2 based cell showed a PCE value of 1.72% with a higher open-circuit voltage of 0.72 V.
Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells represent a promising approach in organic solar cells as renewable energy technology because of their potential of low-cost manufacturing and producing large-scale flexible devices.1 Various combinations of donor and acceptor materials have been used to make the active layer of BHJ solar cells. One of the most efficient BHJ devices is a blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as an electron donor and a soluble C60 derivative, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as an electron acceptor that showed power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 5.5% for single layer devices.2 The efficiency of solar cells based on P3HT:PCBM has reached a limit by thermal treatment,3 blend composition4 and processing solvent.5 New materials are desired to achieve a better performance for practical applications.6
The performance of polymer solar cells is characterized by three parameters: open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill-factor (FF). The open-circuit voltage of BHJ solar cells is related to the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the electron donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the electron acceptor.2d,7 The higher LUMO energy of the acceptor provides a path towards higher Voc, and therefore, higher PCE in solar cells.7,8 Several strategies have been developed to improve the open-circuit voltage of BHJ cells. For example, by placing electron-donating groups on the phenyl ring of PCBM, it can raise the LUMO energy level of PCBM, which allows further optimization of the open-circuit voltage of organic solar cells.8b,8c Using the PCBM bisadduct8d or endohedral fullerene8e in BHJ film, its can also achieve higher open-circuit voltage and PCE. However, the systematic study of polythiophene:PCBM blend films has received limited attention to date. Studies on the photophysics and photochemistry of organic blend films to date have largely focused on polythiophene:fullerene blend films due to their applicability to solar energy conversion.9 Hummelen et al. recently reported a device which was fabricated with a thienyl-substituted fullerene 1 (in Scheme 1) for the purpose of improving the miscibility with P3HT.10 In order to optimize the performance of organic solar cells, we need to understand the process of photoinduced electron transfer in solid-state films.
 Scheme 1  Chemical structures of P3HT, PCBM and thienyl-substituted methanofullerenes 1–5. 
We report herein the synthesis of a series of thienyl-based methanofullerenes, shown in Scheme 1, a thienyl-substituted methanofullerene (1), a bisadduct (2) and higher adducts (3 and 4) and also a monoadduct with electron-donating groups on the thienyl moiety (5), which are employed as electron acceptors to make BHJ solar cells with P3HT, aiming at improving the miscibility and the open-circuit voltage in the BHJ solar cells. The electrochemical and photophysical properties of the new fullerene derivatives as well as the morphology and performance of the P3HT:thienyl-substituted methanofullerene BHJ solar cells are reported in detail.
Experimental
Chemicals and measurements
Chemicals were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification unless otherwise noted. Fullerene C60 (frontier carbon cooperation, Japan), PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate), H. C. Starck), P3HT (Aldrich) and PCBM (nano-C) were purchased. All solvents were purified and freshly distilled prior to use according to literature procedures. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL AL-300 spectrometer and referenced to the solvent peak. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were obtained in linear negative mode using a Kratos Compact MALDI I (Shimadzu), with dithranol as matrix. Elemental analyses of carbon, hydrogen, sulfur and nitrogen were carried out with an Elementar Vario EL III microanalyser. The electrochemical measurements were performed at 298 K using a BAS 100 W electrochemical analyzer in deaerated benzonitrile solution containing 0.1 M TBAPF6 (tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate) as the supporting electrolyte, with Ag/AgNO3 (1.0 × 10−2 M) as a reference electrode and a Pt working electrode and a Pt wire as a counter electrode. Absorption spectra were recorded as solution in chloroform by using a Jasco V-570 spectrophotometer in the range of 250 to 800 nm at room temperature.
Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy experiments were conducted using an ultrafast source: Integra-C (Quantronix Corp.), an optical parametric amplifier: TOPAS (Light Conversion Ltd.) and a commercially available optical detection system: Helios provided by Ultrafast Systems LLC. The source for the pump and probe pulses were derived from the fundamental output of Integra-C (780 nm, 2 mJ per pulse and fwhm = 130 fs) at a repetition rate of 1 kHz. 75% of the fundamental output of the laser was introduced into TOPAS which has optical frequency mixers resulting in tuneable range from 285 to 1660 nm, while the rest of the output was used for white light generation. Typically, 2500 excitation pulses were averaged for 5 s to obtain the transient spectrum at a set delay time. Kinetic traces at appropriate wavelengths were assembled from the time-resolved spectral data. All measurements were conducted at room temperature. The differential absorption spectra were recorded using spin-coated films in each laser excitation. The films were spin-coated with chlorobenzene solution of the P3HT:fullerene derivative (1:0.8 w/w) on glass using a spin coater (MIKASA spin coater MS-A100).

Device fabrication
Organic BHJ solar cells were fabricated on patterned ITO (indium tin oxide)-coated glass substrates as the anode. The ITO/glass substrates were first cleaned in ultrasonic baths of isopropyl alcohol, acetone and isopropyl alcohol. After the ITO/glass substrate was dried in an oven at 80 °C for 10 min, they were treated with UV-ozone for 20 min. The surface of the ITO substrate was modified by spin-coating conducting PEDOT:PSS (CLEVIOS™ PH500) with a thickness of around 40 nm, followed by baking at 120 °C for 10 min in an oven. The P3HT concentration is 12 mg mL−1, while P3HT:PCBM (1:0.8 w/w), P3HT:1 (1:1), P3HT:2 (1:1.2), P3HT:3 (1:1.4), P3HT:4 (1:1.6) and P3HT:5 (1:1.1) were blended together and dissolved in chlorobenzene. The active layers were obtained by spin coating the blend solutions, and thermal annealing at 128 °C for 10 min. The thickness of the active layers was around 130 nm, as measured with an Alpha-step IQ. The cathode consists of 100 nm of aluminium, and was thermally evaporated on top of the polymer film through the use of a shadow mask to define an active area of 0.12 cm2 under a base pressure of 1 × 10−6 Torr (1 Torr = 133.32 Pa).
The current density–voltage curves were obtained using a Keithley 2400 source-measure unit. The photocurrent was measured under illumination using a Newport class-A 150 mW cm−2 solar simulator (AM 1.5 G) and the light intensity was calibrated with an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell with KG-1 filter to give approximately one sun light intensity. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured in the range 300 to 800 nm using a specially designed IPCE system (PV Measurements, Inc.). A 75 W xenon lamp was used as a light source for the generating monochromatic beam. A calibration was performed using a silicon photodiode, which was calibrated using the NIST-calibrated photodiode G425 as a standard, and IPCE values were collected under bias light at a low chopping speed of 10 Hz. The morphology of the P3HT:PCBM and P3HT: fullerene 1–5 films was determined using AFM (Asylum Research MFP-3D) operating in a contact mode, under ambient conditions.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthetic approach to thienyl-substituted methanfullerenes 1–5 is depicted in Scheme 2. The thiophene derivatives 6 and 7 were acylated by using tin(IV) chloride with methyl 5-chloro-5-oxovalerate. The synthesis of methanofullerenes 1–5 was carried out according to Hummelen–Wudl synthetic routes.12 Condensation of 6 and 7 with p-tosylhydrazide in methanol gave the corresponding p-tosylhydrazone 8 and 9. A mixture of 8, sodium methoxide, pyridine and C60 in o-dichlorobenzene was stirred overnight at 90 °C under nitrogen. The solution was heated to reflux, and the reaction was allowed to continue overnight again. The resulting mixture was purified through silica gel column chromatography with toluene as eluent to give unreacted C60 (11%), monoadduct 1 (53%) and bisadduct 2 (18%). Bis or higher adducts 2, 3 and 4 were synthesized by the procedure described for 1 using excess p-tosylhydrazone 8 and the yield of bisadduct 2, trisadduct 3 and tetrakisadduct 4 was 13%, 26% and 56%. The products were further purified by reprecipitation from methanol. The bisadduct 2, trisadduct 3 and tetrakisadduct 4 consist of a number of regioisomers.
 Scheme 2  Synthetic route to methanofullerenes 1 and 5. 
The obtained methanofullerenes 1–5 were characterized by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig. S1, ESI†), elemental analysis, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S2, ESI†). Although both [6,6]methanofullerene and [5,6]fulleroid isomers could be expected from the cycloaddition reaction, the temperature as high as 180 °C at which the reaction proceeds converted the [5,6]-open isomer into the thermodynamically more stable [6,6]-closed isomer.12 These isomers are clearly distinguishable by the 13C NMR chemical shifts of bridging units. The 13C NMR spectrum of fullerene 1 and 5 exhibited bridgehead carbon at 79.88 ppm and 96.03 ppm and bridge carbon at 45.73 ppm and 43.59 ppm. These results are clearly suggestive of a methanofullerene structure with a 6,6 junction. The carbon peaks of higher adducts 2, 3, and 4, with the exclusion of ten peaks of the bisadduct bridgehead carbon, showed the multiple signals.
Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of fullerene derivatives 1–5 were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) at room temperature in benzonitrile solution containing 0.1 M TBAPF6. From Fig. 1, cyclic voltammograms of compound 1, 5, PCBM and C60 show three reversible reduction waves, but compound 2 and 3 show only two reversible reduction waves. The reduction potentials for 1–5, are listed in Table 1 along with PCBM and C60 as reference compounds. In the case of dimethoxy-substituted fullerene 5, the reduction values are slightly more negative than those of compound 1. This could be attributed the inductive effect of the methoxy group on the thiophene ring. It was reported that the alkoxy group of the phenyl ring of PCBM can decrease the reduction potential.8b The first reduction potentials of the higher adducts 2–4 are shifted toward more negative values of ∼100 mV with respect to monoadduct 1 because of fewer π electrons and release of strain energy.13 As a result, it is estimated that the LUMO levels of methanofullerenes 2–5 are raised in comparison with monoadduct 1 and PCBM.

Photophysical properties
The UV-vis absorption properties of C60, PCBM and fullerene derivatives 1–5 in chloroform solution are shown in Fig. 2a. The UV-vis spectra of PCBM and 1 in solution are almost identical, with a peak at 328 nm and 432 nm and broad band at 490 nm, respectively. The absorption features of monosubstituted fullerene derivatives, PCBM, 1 and 5 show a distinguishable sharp band at 432 nm, respectively, which reflects the partially broken symmetry of the fullerene core relative to pristine C60. The main peak at 500 nm of the monoadduct 1 is slightly blue-shifted to about 480 nm in the bisadducts 2 and the trisadduct 3. The UV-vis absorption spectra of fullerene 1–5 and PCBM with P3HT in the thin film show very similar shape (Fig. 2b). Only the absorption of the P3HT:bisadduct 2 film and the P3HT:trisadduct 3 film around 520 nm increased. From the UV-vis absorption, we conclude that there is no distinct change for fullerene 1–5 compared to other methanofullerenes.
 Fig. 2  UV-vis absorption spectra of (a) C60, PCBM and fullerene derivatives 1–5 in CHCl3 and (b) PCBM, and fullerenes 1–5 with P3HT in the thin film. 
To understand the excited-state interaction of P3HT polymer with fullerenes 1–5, we studied the photophysical behaviour in spin-coated films by femtosecond laser flash photolysis. Femtosecond laser excitation at 450 nm of a P3HT:1 film results in the appearance of a transient absorption band in the NIR region at 1 ps, as shown as a black dot in Fig. 3a, which is due to the singlet excited state of P3HT.8e The transient absorption band of 1P3HT* disappears, accompanied by the appearance of a new broad absorption at around 1000 nm due to P3HT positive polaron (P3HT˙+)9a,14 and the methanofullerene radical anion15 at 1000 ps (grey dot in Fig. 3a). This suggests that ultrafast electron transfer from P3HT to the fullerene derivative occurs to form the bound radical pair (BRP) state9a (P3HT˙+/1˙−) in the thin film.

Similar transient absorption spectra were also observed in the case of P3HT:2, P3HT:5 and P3HT:PCBM8e films as shown in Fig. S3, ESI†.
The rate of electron transfer was determined from the decay time profile of 1P3HT* in P3HT:1 film in 20 ps range, as shown in Fig. 3b. The rate constants obtained are listed in Table 1. The lifetimes are determined as 1 ps in P3HT:1 film, 1.2 ps in P3HT:2 film, 1.6 ps in P3HT:3 film, 2.3 ps in P3HT:4 film, 3.4 ps in P3HT:5 film and 2 ps in P3HT:PCBM film. All films give rise to the rapid formation of the BRP state9a after laser excitation as shown in Fig. S4, ESI†. Slow decay of the BRP state was observed in the time range of 3 ns. The lifetime of the BRP state was estimated as 3.6 ns in P3HT:1 film, 6.2 ns in P3HT:2 film, 3.3 ns in P3HT:3 film, 3.0 ns in P3HT:4 film, 3.0 ns in P3HT:5 film and 3.2 ns in P3HT:PCBM film. These BRP states of P3HT:fullerene 1–5 films were found to be stable up to 2000 ps (Fig. 3c and Fig. S5, ESI†). Thus, fullerenes 1 and 2 can act as efficient materials for organic solar cells.
Organic solar cells
BHJ solar cells with ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:fullerene derivatives/Al using P3HT as an electron donor and fullerenes 1–5 as electron acceptors were fabricated and characterized. The weight ratio between the donor and acceptor was adjusted to have the same ratio. The weight ratios of the active layers were 1:0.8 (w/w) (P3HT:PCBM), 1:1 (w/w) (P3HT:1), 1:1.2 (w/w) (P3HT:2), 1:1.4 (w/w) (P3HT:3), 1:1.6 (w/w) (P3HT:4) and 1:1.1 (w/w) (P3HT:5) and were calculated by their molecular weight. The blends were spin-coated from a chlorobenzene solution containing the P3HT:fullerene 1–5 on the ITO/glass substrate covered by a PEDOT:PSS layer, respectively. After completion of solution processing of the various layers, the samples were transferred into a thermal vacuum evaporator to deposit 130 nm of aluminium as the top electrode at 2.1 × 10−6 Torr. The deposited Al electrode area defines the active area of the device as 0.12 cm2. After Al deposition, the device was annealed at 128 °C by a radiation heater for 10 min in a thermal vacuum evaporator at the same vacuum level.

Fig. 4 shows the typical current density–voltage curves for the BHJ solar cells under AM 1.5 conditions at 100 mW cm−2. Table 2 summarizes the device performance of the BHJ solar cells. The performance of the BHJ cells was characterized by three parameters, open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill-factor (FF). The PCE (ηe) is given as PCE = (Voc × Jsc × FF)/Pin, where Pin is the intensity of incident light irradiation.

 Fig. 4  Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of solar cells composed of P3HT:PCBM (1:0.8), P3HT:1 (1:1), P3HT:2 (1:1.2), P3HT:3 (1:1.4), P3HT:4 (1:1.6) and P3HT:5 (1:1.1) under AM 1.5 G simulated solar illumination (100 mW cm−2). 

Fig. 5 shows the IPCE (incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency) plot for the P3HT:PCBM and P3HT: fullerene 1–5 cells. The IPCE plot shows a maximum value of 61.5% and 59.7% for P3HT:PCBM and P3HT:1 cells, respectively, at a wavelength of 580 nm. The P3HT:PCBM cell has a Jsc of 10.9 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.62 V, and FF of 62%. Under the same conditions, the P3HT:1 cell shows a Jsc of 10.9 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.60 V, and FF of 61%. The PCE of the P3HT:1 cell is comparable with the P3HT:PCBM and the value is higher than that previously reported.10 The enhancement could be ascribed to the different solvent system and annealing procedure.

Based on the electrochemical data, it is expected that the Voc of the BHJ solar cell will be increased by replacing the acceptor from PCBM to bis or higher adducts acceptor due to the increased energy difference between the HOMO energy of P3HT and the LUMO energy of the acceptor. The Voc of P3HT:2 cell is enhanced up to 0.72 V, which is 16% higher than that of P3HT:PCBM cell. The Voc values of the BHJ solar cell using higher adducts (P3HT:3 and 4) show similar or smaller Voc compared to P3HT:PCBM cell. The Jsc values of the BHJ solar cell of higher adducts (P3HT:2, 3 and 4) are lower than that of the monoadduct (1) and the Jsc value decreases as the adduct number increases. For the solar cell based on the P3HT:dimethoxy-substituted monoadduct 5 cell, both the Voc and Jsc values are significantly reduced as compared to that of P3HT:PCBM cell. The inferior performance of the higher adduct based BHJ solar cells may be related to the non-optimized BHJ morphology, which is expected to influence the BHJ solar cell performance.16
The BHJ morphology of the films was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Fig. 6 shows the AFM images of the P3HT:PCBM and P3HT:fullerene 1–5 blend films after thermal annealing. The scan range of all AFM images was 10 × 10 μm2 and the Z range was the same. The surface images of the P3HT:PCBM film and P3HT:1 film show fine features compared to that of P3HT:2–4 films. The root-mean-square (rms) roughness is 1.1 nm for P3HT:PCBM and P3HT:1, 3.2 nm for P3HT:2, 2.4 nm for P3HT:3, 2.6 nm for P3HT:4, and 0.4 nm for P3HT:5. This reflects the fact that the domain size in the P3HT: 2–4 BHJ films is larger than that in the P3HT:PCBM and P3HT:1 BHJ films. This difference could be ascribed to the different miscibility of acceptor materials with the P3HT. The miscibility between the polymer and acceptor will be reduced as the number of adduct increases. As a result, P3HT: 2–4 blending systems form larger domain after thermal annealing above the glass transition temperature of the P3HT. The increased domain size reduces the surface area of the donor–acceptor, which will lead to the reduction of exciton dissociation efficiency. Also the lower fill factor (FF) and higher series resistance (Rs) of the higher adduct based cells (P3HT:2–4 films) reflect the increased charge recombination in the BHJ films. The absorption intensity of the BHJ films is similar without concerning the acceptors. This means the number of excitons generated in the films will be similar. And the exciton dissociation also occurs efficiently because rapid electron transfer was observed from the P3HT: 2–4 films. As a result, it is thought that the inferior solar cell performance is ascribed to the large donor–acceptor domain size, which will hinder efficient exciton dissociation and increase charge recombination in the film. We expect that further optimization with a co-solvent system will improve the morphology of the BHJ film and cell performance.

Conclusions
BHJ solar cells using P3HT as an electron donor and fullerenes 1–5 as electron acceptors were prepared and investigated. As expected, the P3HT:bisadduct 2 and P3HT:trisadduct 3 cells exhibit larger open-circuit voltage (Voc) than the P3HT:PCBM cell, as they have higher LUMO energy levels. The ultrafast electron transfer process from P3HT donor polymer to the fullerene derivative was observed by femtosecond measurements in the spin-coated P3HT:1 film. No decay of the bound radical pair state of P3HT:1 film was observed in the time range of 3 ns, which act as an efficient material for solar cells. The P3HT:1 BHJ solar cell shows a Jsc of 10.9 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.60 V, FF of 61% and PCE of 3.97%. Under the same conditions, the P3HT:2 cell shows a Jsc of 5.91 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.72 V, FF of 41% and PCE of 1.72%. The higher adduct 3 and 4 and dimethoxy-substituted monoadduct 5 based devices show low efficiencies as a result of fast decay of radicals. The AFM image of the P3HT:1 blend film shows high morphology comparable to other fullerene derivatives. It is demonstrated that thienyl-substituted fullerene 1 is one of the promising candidates for acceptor materials for BHJ solar cells.
