    , Accepted 16th March 2023First published on 12th April 2023AbstractThe high surface activity and large specific surface area of metal halide perovskite materials create favorable conditions for improving the sensitivity and selectivity of gas sensors. Meanwhile, the high photoelectric conversion efficiency makes perovskite materials the best candidates for new self-powered gas sensing systems. Therefore, the adsorption mechanism of several volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) surfaces was investigated based on first-principles calculations and the non-equilibrium Green's function, including C2H6, CH4, CH3OH, and CH2O. The results show that CsPbBr3 (CPB) has excellent gas-sensing properties for CH2O molecules. The current–voltage (I–V) curves indicate that the transport properties of CH2O after adsorption on the CPB surface had a clear response. Moreover, the good mechanical response makes the adsorption process reversible and provides the possibility for flexible devices. Finally, the good absorption spectrum lays the foundation for the application of CPB in photovoltaic (PV) self-powered sensors. Therefore, we predict that CPB is expected to be a candidate for a CH2O gas sensor with high sensitivity and selectivity.
1. Introduction
Most volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have a unique unpleasant smell, toxicity, irritation, teratogenicity, and carcinogenicity. Outdoors, VOCs mainly come from industrial waste gas generated by fuel combustion and transportation. Indoors, they mainly come from the combustion of coal products and natural gas, as well as the emissions from buildings and decorative materials, furniture, household appliances, and the human body itself. Due to the complexity of VOC emission sources, the diversity of emission forms, and the variety of substances, effective monitoring of VOCs in different environments is an urgent task. In particular, the detection of VOCs released by human respiration through non-invasive medical technology can be used for real-time monitoring of diabetes, breast cancer, asthma, and other diseases.1–3 However, the exploration of microsensors with low power consumption and on-chip integration is the biggest challenge facing this technology.4 Meanwhile, sensing materials that can respond to small changes in the environment and continuously monitor important metabolites will probably completely change solid sensor technology in the future and be applied to new wearable devices. Pb2+ in flexible wearable devices poses a serious threat to human health, but graphene aerogels functionalized with groups can minimize the leakage of Pb2+ and endow the devices with excellent properties.5,6
In the past decades, metal oxide semiconductors based on nanostructures have been widely used as gas sensing materials because of their simple structure, low cost, short response time, and other advantages,7,8 such as ZnO,9,10 CuO,11,12 NiO,13,14 and SnO2.15,16 However, the activation of sensing reactions requires high temperature and external bias voltage,17,18 which limits their development in the field of portable, intelligent and easily integrated new generation sensors. In addition, for sensors that need batteries as energy storage devices, charging in different environments is also very inconvenient.19 Therefore, the research on self-powered gas sensor devices provides a new direction for the sensing field.
To realize the detection of VOCs from the ppm–ppb concentration, it is necessary to study gas-sensing materials with excellent performance. In recent years, many scholars have turned their attention to perovskite materials (ABX3) with a special crystal structure. Compared with metal oxide semiconductors, perovskite materials have unique electrical and magnetic properties, high electrocatalytic activity, relatively simple preparation methods, good chemical and thermodynamic stability, and excellent mechanical properties.20,21 They has broad application prospects in a series of technical fields such as catalysts, gas separation, and solar cells.22–25 In addition, due to the bipolar characteristics of halide perovskites, they can act as p-/n-type semiconductors based on the interaction between the sensor surface and the gas.26–28 Because of this unique and ideal performance, halide perovskites have attracted extensive attention in the field of gas sensors. At the same time, due to the abundance of halide perovskite family members, they have shown excellent performance in the detection of a variety of gases, including nitrogen dioxide,29,30 acetone,31,32 dopamine,33 ammonia,34,35 oxygen,36 ethanol,37 and hydrogen sulfide.38 Moreover, the excitation light source will produce a large number of photogenerated carriers, which will significantly enhance the gas sensing performance.19 To alleviate the limited stability and environmental sensitivity of organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskites, the substitution of metal cations such as Cs ions with organic cations has been explored.39–42 Compared with organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, all inorganic halide perovskites based on metal cations show better stability and elasticity to environmental changes.43–45 Therefore, all inorganic perovskites may be more suitable in the field of gas sensors. Most importantly, halide perovskites, as an active gas sensing material and a light collector, play a dual role, enabling PV self-powered sensing without any external bias applied.46,47
In recent years, more and more researchers have focussed on the expansion and research of PV self-powered gas sensing devices based on perovskites.48–50 It further proves that perovskite materials have outstanding advantages in the field of gas sensing. Therefore, this research mainly explores the application prospects of all inorganic perovskites (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, and I) in the field of VOC detection from the perspective of adsorption mechanism, and provides a theoretical model for the self-powered gas sensor based on CsPbX3 (CPX). We have carried out multi-scale research on the adsorption mechanism of several common organic compounds (including CH4, CH3OH, C2H6, CH3CHO, and CH2O) in VOCs on the surface of CsPbCl3 (CPC), CsPbBr3 (CPB) and CsPbI3 (CPI) through the first principles calculations. Firstly, the electronic properties of the system before and after gas adsorption were studied, including the adsorption energy, the charge transfer, the adsorption distance, the charge difference density (CDD), the electron localization function (ELF), and the density of states (DOS). Then, the application of the adsorption system in the real environment is considered, and the I–V curves before and after simulation of the gas adsorption. The results show that the conductivity of CPB changes most acutely after the adsorption of formaldehyde molecules. Next, through the study of the mechanical properties of the adsorption system, it was found that applying a certain range of biaxial strains to the CH2O/CPB system would increase the adsorption effect and make the adsorption process reversible. In addition, the I–V curve and the absorption spectrum after adding strain were simulated, and CPB still showed excellent performance. Finally, the adsorption behavior of CH2O on defective CPB was simulated, and the results showed that there was always a physical adsorption configuration between CH2O and CPB. In conclusion, CPB shows high selectivity and sensitivity to CH2O molecules. This indicates that the PV self-powered gas sensor based on CPB has great potential advantages in the field of CH2O detection.
2. Computational methods
The results in this study are performed by the projected augmented wave (PAW)51 method as completed in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). The electron–electron interaction is described by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)52 with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)53 exchange functional. Moreover, the van der Waals interactions are described by the DFT-D3 method.54 The plane-wave cutoff energy is set to 520 eV for the slab. We used an adequate number of Monkhorst–Pack k-point grids55 for both geometry optimization and electronic property calculations, which are 8 × 8 × 8 and 6 × 6 × 1, respectively. Meanwhile, a vacuum layer of 30 Å is set to eliminate the interaction between two adjacent images. Then, the energy and force convergence criteria of the system are set to 10−5 eV and 0.01 eV Å−1, respectively., The effect of spin–orbit coupling (SOC) is considered.56
The adsorption energy used to evaluate the adsorption strength between the CsPbX3 surface and gas molecules is defined as follows: Ea = Egas/CPX − Egas − ECPX(1)where Egas/CPX, Egas and ECPX represent the total energy of the gas/CPX adsorption system, isolated gas molecule, and pristine CPX, respectively. A negative Ea represents a favorable combination between CPX and gas. The CDD of the gas/CPX adsorption system is calculated by the following formula: ∇ρ = ρgas/CPX − ρgas − ρCPX(2)where ρgas/CPX, ρgas, and ρCPX represent the charge density of the whole system on which the gas is adsorbed on the CPX, the charge density of the individual gas, and the charge density of the pure adsorption substrate.
In addition, I–V characteristic curves are calculated by non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) based on the ATK software package.57 The current is calculated by the Landauer–Buttiker formula:58 (3)where UR and UL are the electrochemical potential of the right and left electrodes. The electrochemical potential difference between the left and right electrodes is eVb = UL − UR. T(E, Vb) represents the transmission probability of electrons incident at energy E under a potential bias Vb.
3. Results and discussion
At room temperature, the space group of CPX is Pmm, and the crystal structure is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†).66,67 The structural parameters of CPX obtained based on density functional theory are listed in Table 1. We find that the lattice volume of perovskite increases with the progressive increase of the halogen atomic radius, which is consistent with previous studies.68 Then, considering the significant spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effect of the Pb element, the band gap may be underestimated. However, self-interaction usually counteracts the lack of SOC, so the PBE function can often get a more accurate band gap, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The energy band structure and DOS of CPX calculated based on the PBE functional are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The results show that CPX is a direct bandgap semiconductor. All calculations of the band gap are consistent with previous reports,60,64,69 which ensures the accuracy of subsequent studies. In addition, the element-projected energy band of metal halide CPX is calculated, as shown in Fig. 1(b–d). The results show that the contribution of Cs atoms is far from the bottom of the conduction band, while the contribution of lead atoms and halogen atoms is concentrated in the conduction band and valence band, respectively. Therefore, lead atoms and halogen atoms are the main factors affecting the electronic properties of CPX. When the target gas is adsorbed on the surface of CPX, the strong interaction with PB atoms and halogen atoms may lead to significant changes in the electronic properties of the adsorption system. Besides, when different low-index surfaces of CPX are exposed to the environment, the adsorption effect may vary greatly. Meanwhile, different adsorption positions of target molecules on the surface of CPX may produce different effects. Therefore, to take into account all adsorption conditions as much as possible in this work, two different terminals on the (100) surface and several common adsorption positions on the surface (fcc, top, bridge, hcp) are considered, and the specific details are provided in the ESI.† Finally, the most stable adsorption models of the five gases are shown in Fig. 2(a–e), including C2H6 on the PbBr2 termination of the CPB surface (C2H6/CPB), CH3CHO on the PbCl2 termination of the CPC surface (CH3CHO/CPC), CH4 on the CsBr termination of the CPB surface (CH4/CPB), CH3OH on the PbCl2 termination of the CPC surface (CH3OH/CPC), CH2O on the PbBr2 termination of the CPB surface (CH2O/CPB).

The adsorption energies and charge transfer of the five adsorption systems are listed in Table 2. For the C2H6, CH3CHO, CH3OH, and CH4 adsorption systems, the adsorption energies are −0.34 eV, −0.33 eV, −0.46 eV, and −0.18 eV, respectively, which are much smaller than those of the CH2O/CPB system (−0.69 eV). Previous studies have shown that gas molecules can be effectively trapped by the adsorption substrate when the adsorption energy is greater than 0.5 eV.70,71 Therefore, CH2O molecules are more easily adsorbed on the surface of CPB than other gas molecules. In addition, it has been proven that charge transfer is the main adsorption mechanism.72 Thus, Bader charges of five adsorption systems are simulated in Table 2. The positive Q value represents the charge transfer from CPX to the target gas, and the gas molecules act as acceptors. The charge transfer of the CH2O/CPB system is 0.398 e, respectively, higher than that of the other four adsorption systems (0.276 e, 0.259 e, 0.298 e, and 0.04 e). To further explain the charge redistribution after CPX adsorbs gas, the CDD is simulated, as shown in Fig. 3(a–e). The charge accumulation occurs near the gas molecules, and charge depletion occurs on the CPX surface. This is consistent with the Bader charge analysis above. The more charges the gas molecules capture, the greater the change in carrier concentration of the substrate, and the greater the change in resistance. Therefore, the resistance change of the CH2O/CPB adsorption system is significantly higher than those of other systems and can be easily measured in the experimental environment. In addition, the sensitivity model of semiconductor thin films proposed by Cui et al. in their study of the gas-sensitive properties of phosphorene shows that the sensitivity is linearly proportional to the charge transfer.73 This further indicates that CPB is more sensitive and selective to CH2O than other gases. In addition, the adsorption distances of the five adsorption systems are all larger than the sum of the covalent radii of the two related atoms, as shown in Table 2. This indicates that there may be no chemical bond between the target gas and the substrate, which is a physical adsorption configuration. To further prove the adsorption type between gas molecules and the substrate, the ELF was calculated, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4(a–d). There is a red area between the five gases and the substrate, which indicates that all adsorption systems have no local charge overlap. This further proves that the physical adsorption of gas molecules and the adsorption substrate depends on the van der Waals force. It is worth noting that the localization degree of the CH2O/CPB adsorption system is significantly higher than that of other systems, as shown in Fig. 5(a). This is consistent with the above research, and also shows the strong interaction between CH2O and CPB.

Furthermore, the contribution peak of the target gas near the Fermi level in the electronic DOS will impose asymmetry between the transmission of electrons and holes, and improve the conductivity of the adsorption system.74 Therefore, the DOS of C2H6/CPB, CH3OH/CPC, CH3CHO/CPC, and CH4/CPB adsorption systems are calculated in Fig. 4(a–d). From Fig. 4(a), it is found that the energy level contribution of C2H6 is mainly concentrated at −2.5 eV of the valence band, away from the Fermi level. Therefore, C2H6 has little effect on the electronic performance of CPB. For the CH3OH/CPC adsorption system (Fig. 4(b)), the energy level contribution of CH3OH is mainly concentrated between 1.75 eV and 3 eV of the valence band, and the peak value is small, which is also far away from the Fermi energy level. Similarly, in Fig. 4(c), we can see that the energy level contribution of CH3CHO is nearly −4 eV of the valence band and 3 eV of the conduction band respectively, and still far away from the Fermi level. For the CH4/CPB system, the energy level contribution of the gas molecule can be almost ignored, which indicates that the interaction between the CH4 molecule and the adsorption substrate is very small, making it very easy for the CH4 molecules to escape from the CPB surface. Therefore, through the analysis of DOS, we found that C2H6, CH3OH, CH3CHO, and CH4 had little effect on the electronic properties of the adsorption substrate, and the carrier concentration and migration would not change significantly, thus the conductivity of the system could not be significantly increased. It is worth noting that the range of energy level contribution of different systems is consistent with the above adsorption energy. However, for the CH2O/CPB system shown in Fig. 5 (a), the energy level contribution of the CH2O molecule is mainly concentrated at about −0.75 eV of the valence band, which is close to the Fermi level compared with other systems. However, for CPB, there is no locally induced state and the band gap does not change. This may be because the physical adsorption between the CH2O molecule and CPB is connected by van der Waals force, making CPB maintain its original semiconductor properties. Therefore, to further reveal the adsorption mechanism between CH2O and CPB, the projected density of states (PDOS) is calculated as shown in Fig. 5(b). We can find that the P orbitals of O atoms, S orbitals of Pb atoms, and P orbitals of Br atoms have obvious orbital hybridization at around −0.75 eV of the valence band. Due to the existence of orbital hybridization, the adsorption energy and charge transfer between CH2O and CPB are higher than in other systems.75,76 At the same time, the carrier concentration near the top of the valence band of the CPB will also change greatly, resulting in a sharp response to the conductivity. Therefore, CPB is more sensitive and selective to CH2O than other gases.
In addition, the work function (WF) of the five adsorption systems was calculated, as shown in Fig. 6(a). To more intuitively reflect the change of WF of different adsorption systems, the WF value here is the difference between before and after gas adsorption. When C2H6, CH3CHO, and CH3OH are adsorbed on CPX, the WF changes slightly, which are 0.039 eV, 0.048 eV, and 0.05 eV respectively. When CH4 is adsorbed on CPB, the work function of the system decreases by 0.062 eV. However, for the CH2O/CPB system, the change of work function before and after adsorption is 0.107 eV, which is higher than that of other systems. This indicates that when the CPB sensor is exposed to the gas environment, CH2O in the air will contact the CPB, and more charges will accumulate at the interface. At the same time, after the adsorption of CH2O, the system has a larger WF, which will generate a larger built-in electric field and improve carrier mobility, leading to serious changes in the conductivity of the adsorption system, thus increasing the sensitivity of CPB to CH2O. Therefore, we believe that CPB has high sensitivity and selectivity for CH2O molecules.
 Fig. 6  (a) The WF and (b) the I–V curves of the five adsorption systems. The WF and current are the difference between the gas molecules before and after adsorption. The inset is a schematic diagram of the CPX-based sensor. 
In addition to exploring the adsorption mechanism of CH2O on the surface of CPB from a microscopic perspective, the current–voltage (I–V) curves are simulated using the NEGF method, as shown in Fig. 6(b). Here, the dual-probe device structure in the inset of Fig. 6(b) is designed to intuitively understand the current variation in the adsorption system. The CH2O/CPB system shows the most significant current change. When the bias voltage is 1.2 V, the current change reaches 84 μA, which is much higher than the other four adsorption systems (19 μA, 26 μA, 31 μA, and 37 μA). This shows that CH2O can be distinguished from other gases in the experimental environment by measuring the conductivity change of the system under different bias voltages after being adsorbed on CPB. Next, we will estimate the sensitivity (S) of the CPX sensor to five gases using the formula: S = [(R0 − R)/R0] × 100%, where R0 and R are the resistances of CPX without and with gas adsorption, respectively. Under the bias voltage of 1.2 V, the sensitivity of the CH2O/CPB system is 86.1%, which is much greater than that of the CH3OH/CPC system (40.8%), CH4/CPB system (39.3%), CH3CHO/CPC system (19.7%), and C2H6/CPB system (21.7%). Therefore, the calculation of the I–V curve and sensitivity further proved the high sensitivity and selectivity between CH2O and CPB.
Next, we explored the application prospect of CPB in the field of CH2O sensors by studying the mechanical properties of the adsorption system. When the gas is physically adsorbed to the substrate, applying strain can not only effectively improve the adsorption strength,77,78 but also lead to the desorption of the gas by releasing the strain and realizing the reuse of the device.79,80 Therefore, we added uniaxial strain (including x-axis strain and y-axis strain) and biaxial strain to the CH2O/CPB system, and the specific results are shown in Fig. 7(a–c). Here, the strain is defined as ε = (α − α0)/α0, where α0 and α are the lattice parameters of the system without strain and with strain. Meanwhile, the positive and negative values stand for tensile and compressive. It is worth noting that the bottom of the blue dotted line in the figure represents the case where the adsorption energy is negative, in contrast to the positive value above the blue dotted line. When the adsorption energy reaches a positive value, the adsorption phenomenon cannot proceed by itself. From the purple area in Fig. 7(a–c), we can see that after adding 0–4% tensile strain to the CH2O/CPB system, the adsorption energy becomes more and more negative, indicating that the adsorption effect between CH2O and CPB is enhanced. When the tensile strain is greater than 4%, the larger lattice distortion may be an important potential factor that leads to an unstable adsorption effect. Therefore, in practical application, the CH2O sensor with CPB as the gas sensing material can improve the adsorption effect by adding appropriate strain. At the same time, the captured CH2O molecules can escape from the surface of CPB by releasing the strain, making the adsorption process reversible and realizing the reuse of devices.
 Fig. 7  (a–c) The uniaxial and biaxial strains are added to the CH2O/CPB adsorption system. 
The above research proves that strain regulation can appropriately increase the adsorption energy, but the effect of strain on the transport properties of the adsorption system is not clear. Therefore, the I–V response of CH2O adsorbed on the original CPB, added with 2% strain CPB, and added with 4% CPB is also shown in Fig. 8(a). It can be found that the transport characteristics of the adsorption system after adding strain have significantly decreased. In particular, when the bias voltage of the adsorption system with 4% strain reached 1.2 V, the current value was only 0.75 μA, much lower than the original adsorption system (6.97 μA). For the adsorption system (2%), the current difference with the original system is kept within 2 μA, which exhibits a better current response than the system with 4% strain. Although adding 2% strain will lead to the loss of the transport characteristics to some extent, it will also increase the adsorption energy. Therefore, we believe that adding 0–2% strain to CH2O/CPB is the best choice, which can not only ensure the current response but also increase the adsorption effect.

The self-powered gas sensor based on PV can maintain itself under light and achieve the goal of zero power consumption, which may have great application prospects in the future. In this context, the optical absorption spectrum of CH2O before and after adsorption on CPB is simulated, as shown in Fig. 8(b), to explore the possibility of CPB in PV self-powered gas sensing. The spectral peak value of CPB before gas adsorption was 17.3 × 105 cm−1, while it decreased to 16.5 × 105 cm−1 after adsorption. Although the peak value has decreased, it still shows excellent light absorption ability. In addition, when the wavelength is greater than 350 nm, the absorption spectrum has a redshift, and the light absorption capacity in the visible light range is further improved. Then, the light absorption capacity of the adsorption system with biaxial strain is simulated. The results show that the peak value of the absorption spectrum decreases gradually with the increase of tensile strain. When the biaxial tensile strain reaches 4%, the peak value decreases to 13.8 × 105 cm−1, and the redshift phenomenon still exists, but it is between pure CPB and CH2O/CPB systems. Although the adsorption of CH2O and the addition of strain will reduce the peak value, the decrease is small and there is an obvious redshift phenomenon. Therefore, the CPB before and after the adsorption of CH2O shows excellent light response ability, which theoretically lays the foundation for the CPB-based PV self-powered sensor.
After filling the chlorine atom vacancies, ammonia molecules interact strongly with lead atoms containing surface dangling bonds, forming a locking and bonding mechanism,81,82 which makes FAPbCl3 have strong selectivity for NH3. Therefore, in this study, we built eight defect models to verify whether the above lock-and-key mechanism exists between CH2O and CPB. All Br vacancies and Pb vacancies are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), including V1Br, V2Br, V3Br, V4Br, V1Pb, V2Pb, V3Pb, and V4Pb. In addition, the energy of the defective substrate, the energy of the gas/defective substrate, and the Pb–O distance before and after adsorption are listed in Table S7 (ESI†). By comparing the energy of different defect substrates, it is found that the system energy after the formation of VBr is more negative than that of VPb, which proves that the VBr model is more stable. After CH2O is adsorbed on the defect substrate, the energy difference of the VBr model is between 0.01 eV and 0.05 eV, while the energy difference between VPb models is one order of magnitude higher than that of the VBr model. This shows that different VBr have little effect on the adsorption of CH2O while having the opposite effect. Therefore, we predict that the interaction between O atoms and different VPb is still the main factor affecting the adsorption of CH2O on CPB. Next, the Pb–O bond length before and after adsorption is compared to judge the interaction between Pb and O atoms in the adsorption process. The results show that when the adsorption system reaches the convergence state, the Pb atoms and O atoms in all models are closed. To further determine whether the lock-and-key mechanism is formed by bonding between Pb and O, the ELF of eight defect models is calculated, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). In all models, there is no charge overlap between CH2O and the defective substrate, which proves that CH2O and the defective CPB cannot rely on the formation of chemical bonds to form a lock-and-key mechanism. Combined with the above research, orbital hybridization is the main mechanism of CH2O physical adsorption on CPB.
Finally, we compared this work with previous reports, as shown in Table 3. The results showed that the adsorption of CH2O on SnS, GaN, B3O3, BP5, and CPB was physical adsorption, while that on RuPc, AiN, and BP was chemical adsorption. Although the adsorption energy of the physical adsorption system is less than that of the chemical adsorption system, for the above chemical adsorption systems, after gas adsorption, due to the formation of chemical bonds, the substrates have undergone significant deformation. In practical applications, the damage caused by deformation is irreparable, which severely limits the service life of the device and sharply reduces the repeatability of the sensor. At the same time, if the target gas undergoes desorption from the chemical adsorption system, more external stress is required, which increases the cost. Therefore, the CH2O/CPB adsorption system, as a physical adsorption system with high adsorption energy, can solve the above problems well, making CPB exhibit broad application prospects in the field of self-powered sensors.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, the gas-sensing properties of CPX for several common VOCs, including C2H6, CH4, CH3CHO, CH3OH, and CH2O, are investigated using first principles and non-equilibrium Green's function. The results of electronic properties show that the existence of orbital hybridization between CPB and CH2O leads to large absorption energy and charge transfer, which are −0.69 eV and 0.398 e, respectively. In addition, the current–voltage (I–V) curves show that the transport characteristics of the system change most significantly when CH2O is adsorbed on CPB. Then through the estimation of WF and sensitivity, the high sensitivity of CPB to the CH2O molecule is further proved. Besides, good mechanical properties are exhibited when strain is applied to the CH2O/CPB system. This suggests that the adsorption and desorption of CH2O molecules can be achieved by strain modulation, and provide the possibility for flexible sensing devices. Finally, the excellent light absorption ability of the adsorption system proves the great potential of CPB in the field of PV self-powered sensors. Therefore, CPB is expected to be a candidate for a CH2O sensor with high sensitivity and selectivity.
