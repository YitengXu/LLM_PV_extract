    , Accepted 6th January 2022First published on 6th January 2022AbstractSingle-phase magnesium molybdate, MgMoO4, is successfully synthesized by a facile sol-gel method. Attributed to the multielectron reaction and the synergistic effect of the elements molybdenum (Mo) and magnesium (Mg), the MgMoO4 electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical properties. After activation, benefiting from the decrease in particle size and the uniform nanosphere morphology, the MgMoO4 electrodes can deliver a stable high specific capacity of about 1060 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 after 600 cycles. Based on the important role of the activation process, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and scan rate cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement methods were employed to reveal the effect of the activation process on the electrochemical behavior of the electrode material.

1. Introduction
Until now most energy consumption in daily life and industrial production originates from non-renewable sources. To alleviate the energy crisis as soon as possible, it is vital to promote clean energies such as wind, solar, hydro and other renewables to substitute non-renewable energy.1 The emergence of rechargeable batteries that can reversibly convert electricity into chemical energy accelerates the use of renewable energy, making it possible to solve the energy problem.2 Currently, there are a large number of rechargeable batteries with different characteristics, uses, advantages and disadvantages,3 such as lithium ion batteries (LIBs),4–7 sodium ion batteries (SIBs),8–10 zinc ion batteries (ZIBs),11 magnesium ion batteries (MIBs)3,12etc. Among all these types of rechargeable batteries, LIBs occupy an absolute dominant position. Graphite is the primary anode material for commercial LIBs and has made a great contribution to the development of lithium-ion batteries. However, with the rapid development of new energy devices (e.g., electric vehicles, laptops, cell phones and digital cameras), graphite is limited by its poor theoretical specific capacity; thus, it has become a hindrance for the development of LIBs with high electrochemical performance.13–15
To further improve the energy storage capacity of LIBs, a lot of research efforts have been devoted to designing novel anode materials to meet the needs of the whole of the modern world. Lithium metal with a specific capacity of about 3800 mA h g−1 and low reduction potential is considered as an alternative to graphite.16 However, the serious safety issues and poor cyclability hinder its practical application and need to be further improved by many methods such as choosing suitable electrolyte additives,17 constructing stable electrolyte interphases, modifying separators etc.18,19 The silicon anode is also an attractive anode for next generation LIBs because of its high specific capacity and low cost. However, the large volume change leads to slow lithium ion transportation and poor mechanical stability. Designing a Si/MXene configuration is necessary to effectively enhance the structural stability of the electrode material.4 In addition, the design of various types and structures of electrode materials to endow electrodes with higher reversible capacity, enhanced rate capability and longer durability has attracted much attention. F. Bella et al. designed a vertically aligned TiO2 nanotube anode. Because the regularly aligned inner nanopores provide preferential pathways for the fast ion diffusion, the prepared electrode exhibits an excellent rate capability and very stable long-term cycling performance with larger specific capacities.9,10 More electrode designs including the carbonised nanocellulose-binded graphite-based anode,5 Fe2Mo3O8/MoO2@C composites anode,6 poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene/manganese oxide coated on a porous carbon nanofiber anode,7etc. have also been reported to further improve the performance of batteries in various aspects. However, practical applications still face some difficulties.
Transition metal oxides (TMOs; M: Cu, Co, Ni, Mo, etc.)20–23 are considered appealing alternative electrode materials because of their large theoretical specific capacity, which is attributed to the multiple valence states of transition metal elements. For example, CoO and Co3O4 are considered as anode materials of LIBs and can deliver a high specific capacity of about 715 mA h g−1 and 890 mA h g−1, respectively, based on the multi-electron conversion reactions of molybdenum. Unfortunately, there are some inherent disadvantages, such as terrible structural stability and huge volume expansion, which hamper their performance as electrode materials. Designing hydrated metal oxides to modulate interlayer spacing is considered an effective way to solve these problems effectively.24–27
Attributed to multi-electron reactions and synergistic effects between two metal elements, hydrated metal oxides such as NiV2O6, MnV2O6, VOMoO4, Ni2V2O7 and FeMoO428–32 exhibit excellent electrochemical performance as anodes of LIBs and have been widely reported. Considering the existence of multiple valence states of Mo (from 6+ to 0), as one of the binary transition metal oxides, MgMoO4 is expected to be a high specific capacity anode material for LIBs. However, there have been few reports on the electrochemical energy storage of MgMoO4 until now and the lithium storage mechanism of MgMoO4 is still unknown.33
Herein, we successfully synthesized pure MgMoO4 by a facile sol-gel method. As an anode of LIBs, after an activation process, the MgMoO4 electrode exhibited an excellent electrochemical performance with a high stable specific capacity of about 1060 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1. EIS, SEM and scan rate CV measurement methods were employed to reveal the effect of the activation process on the electrochemical behavior. Furthermore, based on the in situ XRD and ex situ XPS methods, we illustrate the lithium storage mechanism of the MgMoO4 electrode in detail.
2. Experimental and computational details
MgMoO4 was synthesized by a sol-gel method, where analytical grade Mg(CH3COO)2·4H2O and MoO3 were employed as raw materials. In the synthetic route, a precise amount of Mg(CH3COO)2·4H2O (2.1447 g) was added into a beaker with 80 ml of deionized water, and magnetically stirred at 70 °C. When the solution became transparent, a precise amount of MoO3 (1.4394 g) was added with a 1:1 molar ratio of charge. The precursor of MgMoO4 was obtained after magnetic stirring overnight. Then, the precursor was put into a tube furnace and annealed at different temperatures for 5 h in an ultrapure N2 atmosphere. Finally, the samples were obtained after a slow cooling of 2 °C per minute.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of MgMoO4 was collected by using a Bruker D8 diffractometer equipped with a graphite monochromator and a Cu Kα radiation source. The continuous-scanning mode had a step scan range of 10°–80° and a scanning step of 0.02° s−1. The GSAS program (Larson & Von Dreele, 2000) with the EXPGUI interface (Toby, 2001) was used to refine the structure of the samples.34,35
The surface morphology of the sample was obtained by field emission scanning electron microscopy (Gemini SEM 500). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (ESCALAB210) was performed with an Al Kα radiation source to measure the chemical binding state of the sample.
The electrochemical properties of the MgMoO4 samples were measured with a standard CR2032 coin cell. The electrodes were prepared with the MgMoO4 sample, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and acetylene black mixed in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) at a certain mass ratio (8:1:1). First, the obtained paste mixture was coated on the copper foil at 60 °C for 12 h to remove the NMP ingredients. Then, the prepared electrode was put into a vacuum drying oven at 90 °C for 12 h and cut into a circular disk with a diameter of 14 mm. The mass loading of the active material was about 1 mg. The CR2032 coin cell was assembled in a glove box filled with high-purity argon with lithium metal as the counter electrode, Celgard® 2320 as the separator and the 1 M LiPF6 (EC):dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (1:1 vol%) solution as the electrolyte. For electrochemical measurements, the coin cells were individually stored overnight at room temperature to allow for the complete penetration of the electrolyte.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed with an electrochemical workstation (Autolab PGSTAT302N, Metrohm, Netherlands) in the frequency range of 0.1–100 MHz and an AC voltage of 5 mV. Cyclic voltammetric (CV) curves were recorded using the same electrochemical workstation in the voltage range from 0.01 V to 3.0 V at a constant current of 0.1 mV s−1.
First-principles calculations were performed using the projector augment wave method as implemented in the VASP code. The exchange and correlation potentials were treated with the generalized gradient approximation within the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) scheme. Since our Rietveld's refinement results for MgMoO4 reproduce well the experimental results, the resulting equilibrium lattice constants and atomic positions were then used to study the electronic structures of MgMoO4. Because of the Mo 4d orbitals are chemically active, they are explicitly treated as a part of the valence electrons. The employment of an energy cutoff of 800 eV and an 8 × 8 × 8 k-point mesh is sufficient to ensure energy convergence to within 1 meV.
3. Results and discussion
The XRD patterns of the MgMoO4 power sample annealed at 650 °C are shown in Fig. 1(a). For comparison, the XRD pattern of the crystalline MgMoO4 sample from the crystal structure database (ICSD #20418, C2/m) is also shown in the same figure. Good matching of the diffraction peak position and relative peak intensity of the two XRD patterns indicated that pure phase MgMoO4 was successfully synthesized by the sol-gel method. Furthermore, the effect of annealing temperature on sample preparation is shown in Fig. S1.†36 Under our experimental conditions, the lowest annealing temperature to obtain the pure phase MgMoO4 sample is 650 °C. To explore the structural information of the sample, Rietveld's refinement was conducted for the MgMoO4 sample using the GSAS program. The refinement results, shown in Fig. 1(b), exhibit a good agreement between the calculated and the experimental XRD patterns. The reasonably small Rwp factor (7.74%) indicated the accuracy of the selected model and the reliability of the refinement results. The lattice parameters of the sample from the refinement results and some reported in the literature are listed in Table 1,36–40 and the corresponding sites and coordinates of each atom for our MgMoO4 sample are shown in Table 2. Both the lattice parameters and corresponding atom sites and coordinates of atoms of our sample agreed with V. B. Mikhailik's report.37

The structure of MgMoO4 based on the crystal structure parameters obtained from the Rietveld's refinement results is shown in Fig. 2(a)–(c). In the MgMoO4 framework, there are two nonequivalent Wyckoff sites 4i and 4 g for Mg, 4i and 4 h for V, and 4i and 8j for O. All the Mg atoms are coordinated by six oxygen atoms with two Mg–O bond lengths (about 2.065(5) Å and 2.167(3) Å), forming a regular MgO6 octahedron where the Ni atom occupies the central position. Furthermore, all Mo atoms are coordinated by 4 oxygen atoms to form a twisted MoO4 tetrahedron with a Mo–O distance varying from 1.731(3) Å to 1.801(6) Å. The MgO6 octahedron combines the MoO4 tetrahedron by sharing an oxygen atom to form a plane in the z-axis direction. In the plane, the MgO6 octahedron and MoO4 tetrahedron were linked to each other and the MoO4 tetrahedron shared 4 oxygen atoms with the MgO6 octahedron to form a zigzag plane. Ultimately, the planes of MgO6 and MoO4 constituted a stable three-dimensional hierarchical architecture by van der Waals forces along the y-axis.

(d) Calculated band structure and density of states for MgMoO4. Zero energy is set at the Fermi's level. Electronic charge density contour plots for the valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM) are also given in (e). Orange, purple and red balls represent Mg, Mo and O atoms, respectively. 
The calculated band structure and projected density of states in Fig. 2(d) reveal that MgMoO4 has an indirect gap (3.8 eV) which is very close to L. Zhang's experimental value (3.72–3.78 eV) and the calculated result (3.70 eV):41 the valence band maximum (VBM) is near the Y point along the C–Y direction and the conduction band minimum (CBM) is near the Γ point along the A–Γ direction. The VBM of MgMoO4 is characterized by a very flat dispersion, which results in heavy holes with large effective masses and may lead to poor p-type conductivity. We can see the bridge bonding character of Mg. The Mg atom is relatively inactive when determining the band edges of MgMoO4, but the occurrence of the Mg 3s and 3p states in both the valence band and conduction band indicates the role of Mg as a bridge in the coupling of tetrahedrally coordinated Mo–O electrons. Clearly, these results including the characteristics of the electronic states around the band edge and the flat top of the valence state are well consistent with Santiago et al.'s report.36
The electronic charge density of the VBM (Fig. 2(e)) indicates charge minima oriented along the Mg–O bond directions, which is characteristic of the ionicity of the Mg–O bonds. We can also see the multiple bonding characteristics of Mo and O. The narrow band at VBM-16 eV is considered as the O 2s semicore state, showing atomic-like (nonbonding) charge distributions. There is a strong hybridization between the O 2p and Mo 4d electronic states near the band edge. The large p–d repulsion separates the bonding states below and the antibonding states above. The enclosed charge densities clearly exhibit bonding character along the Mo–O bonds (with charge buildup along these bonds) in the VBM and antibonding character (with charge lobes around Mo, pointing away from the Mo–O bonds towards the interstitial sites) in the CBM. Both the density of states and the electronic charge density in Fig. 2(e) show that the VBM and CBM show O p-like state and Mo d-like state characteristics, respectively. The energy gap of MgMoO4 (3.8 eV) is slightly smaller than that of the Li3VO4 (3.93 eV) anode material, implying that it can also be used as an anode for LIBs.42
The electrochemical performance of the MgMoO4 sample was evaluated using coin cells. To obtain stable experimental results and reliable experimental data, three coin cells are assembled at the same time for each test. Clearly, attributable to the different sample particle size, the annealing temperatures have a great influence on the electrochemical performance of the prepared MgMoO4 samples (see Fig. S2 and S3†). Fig. 3(a) shows the 1st, 2nd and 3rd discharge/charge curves of the MgMoO4 electrode at a current density of 100 mA g−1 under a voltage window of 0.01–3.0 V. Clearly, the first discharge curve shows obvious differences, including profile and specific capacity, which can be attributed to the different reaction mechanisms between the first discharge process and the subsequent cycle, which will be discussed in the following in situ XRD analysis. After the first discharge, the obviously similar charge/discharge curves indicated that the electrode material possesses excellent reversibility in the subsequent cycles. The same experimental results are also observed in the MgMoO4 film anode for LIBs and the MgMoO4 anode for Na-ion batteries.40,43 The electrochemical cycling stability of the electrode material is shown in Fig. 3(b). Although the electrode material exhibits lower specific capacities in the first few cycles, with an increase in the number of cycles the specific capacity of the electrode material gradually increases. Impressively, after about 600 cycles (a slow activation process), the reversible specific capacity is as high as 1060 mA h g−1, which is close to three times the capacity of the commercial graphite anode. Moreover, the complete overlap of the charge/discharge curves after 600 cycles, as shown in Fig. 3(c), indicated that the MgMoO4 electrode delivered a stabilized electrochemical behavior after a long activation. The phenomenon that the capacity firstly dropped then raised and gradually stabilized fully agrees with L. Zhang's reports.33 The experimental results indicate that, after a long activation process (about 300 cycles), the specific capacity of MgMoO4/reduced graphene oxide electrode reaches a stable value of 596.8 mA h g−1 with a high Coulombic efficiency (∼99%). To evaluate the rate performance of the activated electrode material, the cycle performance of the electrode material at different current densities is presented in Fig. 3(d).
 Fig. 3  The electrochemical performance of the MgMoO4 electrode: (a) typical discharge/charge curves for the first three cycles; (b) the cycle performance; (c) discharge/charge curves from the 600th to 602th cycle and (d) the rate ability of the MgMoO4 electrode after 600 cycles. 
As the current density increases from 100 to 800 mA g−1, although a continuous reduction in specific capacity was observed at a high current density of 800 mA g−1, a higher specific capacity of 330.6 mA h g−1 can still be maintained. Surprisingly, the specific capacity fully recovers to the initial high capacity of 1060.5 mA h g−1 withthe current density returning back to 100 mA g−1, implying the fast kinetics and stable structure of the activated electrode.
For the sake of exploring the structural stability of the MgMoO4 electrode during cycling, the CV measurement results are shown in Fig. 4. The first cathodic scan (Fig. 4(a)) reveals a completely different electrochemical behavior, where the two obvious reduction peaks (1.50 V and 0.75 V) can be attributed to the formation of new phases corresponding to the decomposition of the initial electrode material caused by the intercalation of the lithium ions.44 Interestingly, after the first cathodic scan, there are no obvious redox peaks in subsequent cycles and, when it reaches the 100th cycle, two slight oxidation peaks (1.39 V and 2.30 V) and two weak reduction peaks around 0.5 V gradually appear (Fig. 4(b)), which is corresponding to the multielectron reaction based on Mg and Mo oxides,45,46 and the intensity of these peaks becomes very strong after 600 cycles (Fig. 4(c)). To explore the interesting phenomenon, the CV tests at different scan rates for the MgMoO4 electrode in different cycles were performed as shown in Fig. 4(d)–(f). The corresponding kinetic information is shown in Fig. 4(g)–(i), and the values are calculated by using the following formula relating the peak currents (i) and the scan rate (v),i = avb,where i and v are the peak currents and scan rate, respectively, and a and b are variable parameters. When the value of b is equal to 0.5, the electrode kinetics exhibit a diffusion-controlled process, and when the value of b is equal to 1, it is regarded as a dominantly capacitive effect corresponding to the surface-controlled process.47 Clearly, the value of b shows a trend of steadily decreasing from the 1st to 600th cycle in Fig. 4(g)–(i), which indicates that the surface-controlled process is dominant for fresh electrodes, and then the proportion of the diffusion-controlled process gradually increases during cycling. The interesting evolution of electrode kinetics can clarify the variation in the CV curves in the different cycles. When the surface-controlled process is dominant, the fast charge/discharge reaction occurring on the surface of the electrode material corresponds to the CV curves without obvious redox peaks, and redox peaks appear when the diffusion-controlled process works.48–51 In addition, the proportion of pseudocapacitance can be obtained by using the following formula: i = k1v + k2v1/2(1)where k1 and k2 are adjustable parameters, and k1v and k2v1/2 behave as surface-controlled and diffusion-controlled parameters, respectively.52,53 According to Fig. 4(j)–(l), the proportion of pseudocapacitive contribution is 94.7% for the fresh electrode, and then the value becomes 88.1% after 100 cycles, which is 9.58% for the electrode after 600 cycles at an equal scan rate of 1 mV s−1. It can be seen from the above results that the variation in the electrochemical kinetics for the electrode during cycling greatly improves the electrochemical performance, which may be attributed to the morphology and structural evolution of the electrode material during the change/discharge process.

The SEM images of the electrode in the different cycles were recorded to manifest the variation of morphology as shown in Fig. 5. The MgMoO4 powder is composed of lumpy particles of about 1 μm, Fig. 5(a), which is disadvantageous to the insertion and extraction of lithium ions, and after 50 cycles, the size of the large lumpy particles decreased to about 500 nm, Fig. 5(b). With a further increase in the number of cycles, as shown in Fig. 5(c), the size of the particles is about 200 nm after 300 cycles.
 Fig. 5  SEM images of the MgMoO4 powder (a) and the corresponding electrode material after 50 cycles (b), after 300 cycles (c), after 400 cycles (d), and after 600 cycles (e) and (f). 
It is amazing that the lumpy particles begin to be partly pulverized to spherical particles after 400 cycles (Fig. 5(d)). As shown in Fig. 5(e) and (f), after 600 cycles the morphology of the entire electrode material transforms into nanospheres with a diameter of less than 100 nm. Clearly, due to the significant decrease in the material size, which shortens the diffusion length of lithium ions and adds active sites for Li+ insertion, after a long activation process, the electrode material exhibited a high specific capacity and excellent cycling stability, which is consistent with the long-term cyclability results (see Fig. 3b).
To further investigate the reaction kinetics of the excellent electrode after activation, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) plots were obtained in a frequency range from 0.01 to 100 kHz, as shown in Fig. 6(a). Two different equivalent circuit models, model 1 and model 2 (see the inset in Fig. 6(a)), were employed to fit the EIS curves of the fresh electrode and the electrode after 600 cycles, respectively. The obvious difference between the two models is ascribed to the formation of the SEI layer, which generates the SEI layer resistance (Rs) and capacitance of the surface layer (CPE2) of model 2. Clearly, after a long activation, the obvious decrease in the charge transfer resistance (Rct) value (from 153.6 to 8.8) indicates that the activation process significantly improves the conductivity of the electrode material. In addition, the lithium-ion diffusion coefficient of the corresponding electrode material is also calculated by using the following formula:54  where n stands for the quantity of transferring electrons per molecule, and T, R, F, A and C represent the test temperature, gas constant, Faraday constant, electrode material surface area and corresponding lithium ion concentration of electrode materials, respectively. Furthermore, σ is the slope of the fitted line between Z′ and ω−1/2 in the low frequency region in Fig. 6(b), which reflects the interface dynamics of the electrode.55
 Fig. 6  EIS plots (a) and the corresponding linear fitting of the Z′ vs. ω−1/2 relationship for the fresh MgMoO4 electrode material and the electrode after 600 cycles (b). 
The lithium-ion diffusion coefficients of the fresh MgMoO4 electrode and the electrode material after 600 cycles are 0.98 × 10−17 cm2 s−1 and 3.02 × 10−16 cm2 s−1 respectively. Compared with the fresh electrode, the significantly increased lithium-ion diffusion coefficient indicated that the electrode material after 600 cycles exhibited faster electrode kinetics. Obviously, the increased lithium-ion diffusion coefficient and improved conductivity significantly improved the reaction kinetics of the electrode material. As an anode material for LIBs, the MgMoO4 electrode material exhibited a high reversible specific capacity and excellent cycle stability after an activation process.
To explore the reaction mechanism of the MgMoO4 electrode material, in situ XRD was employed to investigate the structural change of the electrode material during the discharge/charge process. The XRD pattern evolution of the electrode material in the first cycle is shown in Fig. 7(a); some strong diffraction peaks remain unchanged, which can correspond to Be, BeO, the separator and so on. With continuous discharge, the three main diffraction peaks of the MgMoO4 electrode (marked with the red line in the bottom of the figure) gradually became weaker, indicating the occurrence of phase evolution. It should be noted that the three diffraction peaks did not completely disappear after the first discharge and still remained in the subsequent charge process, which implied the existence of a few MgMoO4 particles after the first cycle. In fact, attributed to the large particle size, most of the reactions only occur on the surface of the sample during the first discharge process, which is in agreement with the result of capacitive contributions in Fig. 4. After discharge, there were still some remaining unused active materials in the inner layer of large lumpy MgMoO4 particles, which led to the existence of diffraction peaks of the MgMoO4 phase. In addition, some slight peak position variations reflected that the phase evolution of the electrode material was observed in the three specific positions marked with dotted frames.

To more clearly analyze the peak evolution, the diffraction peaks in the three specific regions of the in situ XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 7(b). Clearly, after discharging to 0.65 V in the first discharge process, three new peaks gradually appear at 37.3°, 43.3° and 62.4° and become strengthened. However, with a further decrease in the discharge voltage, a significant shift of the three peaks towards a lower angle can be observed, and upon discharging to 0.5 V the three new peaks located at 37.0°, 43.1° and 62.1° can be well indexed to the (222), (400) and (440) diffraction peaks of Li2MoO3 (ICSD #202797, R3-MH). Therefore, the new phase formed upon discharging to 0.65 V can be described as LixMoO3 (x < 2) and the final phase can be named Lix+yMoO3 (x + y > 2) when the MgMoO4 electrode discharges to 0.01 V. It is interesting to note that the three peaks exhibit a reverse shift, which goes back from 36.7°, 42.5° and 61.3° to 37.3°, 43.3° and 62.4° respectively, when the MgMoO4 electrode charges from 0.01 to 3 V and the changes in the peak position correspond to Lix+yMoO3 transforming into LixMoO3. The periodic variation of the three peak positions is in agreement with the transformation between LixMoO3 and Lix+yMoO3 during the charge and discharge process, which can be further confirmed by the ex situ XPS results of MgMoO4 during cycling.
The ex situ XPS spectra of the MgMoO4 electrode material at different discharge/charge stages are employed to further analyze the reversible delithiation/lithiation mechanism. Fig. 8(a) and (b) show the XPS spectra of Mg 1s and Mo 3d of the MgMoO4 electrode discharging to 0.01 V and charging to 3 V in the first cycle. In Fig. 8(a), the peaks at 1303.90 eV and 1302.87 eV are related to Mg2+ 1s and Mg0 1s, and the existence and disappearance of Mg0 during the first discharge/charge process indicated that there was a redox reaction based on Mg0/Mg2+.56

However, it was necessary to point out that the existence of Mg2+ during the first charging to 3 V may be ascribed to surface oxidation and the remaining unused MgMoO4 materials. In Fig. 8(b), the three pairs of peaks (232.85 eV and 236.01 eV, 232.18 eV and 235.29 eV, and 230.31 eV and 233.40 eV) are related to Mo6+ 3d3/2 and 3d5/2, Mo4+ 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 and Mo2+ 3d3/2 and 3d5/2.57–59 The coupling of Mo2+/Mo4+ corresponds to the formation of Lix+yMoO3 during the first discharge process, and the coupling of Mo4+/Mo6+ can be attributed to Lix+yMoO3 transfer into LixMoO3 during the first charge process. Interestingly, the XPS spectra of Mg 1s and Mo 3p of the MgMoO4 electrode at the same voltage (0.01 V or 3 V) between the first and 600th cycles are semblable in Fig. 8(c) and (d), which indicates that the conversion reaction mechanism is the same for the MgMoO4 electrode material during cycling.
Based on the above experimental results, we successfully speculated on the charge/discharge mechanism of the MgMoO4 anode material. In the first discharge process, an irreversible phase change occurred. During the first discharging to 0.6 V, MgMoO4 was first converted into MgO and a LixMoO3 transitional phase. Then, as the discharge process continued, LixMoO3 was gradually converted into Lix+yMoO3, corresponding to the Li ion being inserted into the crystal structure of LixMoO3, and at the same time MgO could be transformed into Mg. In the subsequent charge process, a reversible Li-ion deintercalation reaction occurred. The corresponding reaction equation is shown below: MgMoO4 + xLi+ + xe− → MgO + LixMoO3(2) LixMoO3 + yLi+ + ye− ↔ Lix+yMoO3(3) MgO + 2Li+ + 2e− ↔ Mg + Li2O(4)
4. Conclusions
Magnesium molybdenum bimetal oxide MgMoO4 was synthesized by a facile sol-gel method. XRD and corresponding Rietveld's refinement were employed to confirm the purity of MgMoO4. Benefiting from the multielectron reaction of Mg and Mo, the MgMoO4 electrode delivered excellent electrochemical performance as an anode material of LIBs. Although the specific capacity of the MgMoO4 electrode was only 241 mA h g−1 at 100 mA h g−1 in the first 30 cycles, after activation an excellent electrochemical performance was observed with a high stable specific capacity of about 1060 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1. Using CV, EIS and SEM, we revealed the electrode kinetics process and the variation in the morphology in which large lumpy particles (about 1 μm) of the MgMoO4 electrode were pulverized into small nanospheres with a diameter of less than 100 nm during cycling. After activation, the significant decrease in the material size could shorten the diffusion length of the lithium ions, and the spherical morphology could add active sites to the MgMoO4 electrode upon Li+ insertion, and thus an improved lithium-ion diffusion coefficient could be observed and the diffusion-controlled process could be dominant in terms of electrode kinetics. In addition, after activation, the MgMoO4 electrode material showed excellent rate stability as a novel anode material for LIBs. Based on the in situ XRD and ex situ XPS results, we analyzed the reaction mechanism in detail during cycling. In the first delithiation cycle, the MgMoO4 electrode material was converted into the transition phases of MgO and LixMoO3, and ultimately transformed into Mg and Lix+yMoO3, respectively. In the subsequent charge and discharge process, the reversible multi-electron conversion reaction of Mg and Lix+yMoO3 occurred.
