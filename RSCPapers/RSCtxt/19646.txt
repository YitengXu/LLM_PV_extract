    , Accepted 10th June 2015First published on 10th June 2015AbstractThe increasing global energy demand has stimulated great recent efforts in investigating new solutions for artificial photosynthesis, a potential source of clean and renewable solar fuel. In particular, according to the generally accepted modular approach aimed at optimising separately the different compartments of the entire process, many studies have focused on the development of catalytic systems for water oxidation to oxygen. While in recent years there have been many reports on new catalytic systems, the mechanism and the active intermediates operating the catalysis have been less investigated. Well-defined, molecular catalysts, constituted by transition metals stabilised by a suitable ligand pool, could help in solving this aspect. However, in some cases molecular species have been shown to evolve to active metal oxides that constitute the other side of this catalysis dichotomy. In this paper, we address the evolution of tetracobalt(III) cubanes, stabilised by a pyridine/acetate ligand pool, to active species that perform water oxidation to oxygen. Primary evolution of the cubane in aqueous solution is likely initiated by removal of an acetate bridge, opening the coordination sphere of the cobalt centres. This cobalt derivative, where the pristine ligands still impact on the reactivity, shows enhanced electron transfer rates to Ru(bpy)33+ (hole scavenging) within a photocatalytic cycle with Ru(bpy)32+ as the photosensitiser and S2O82− as the electron sink. A more accentuated evolution occurs under continuous irradiation, where Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy reveals the formation of Co(II) intermediates, likely contributing to the catalytic process that evolves oxygen. All together, these results confirm the relevant effect of molecular species, in particular in fostering the rate of the electron transfer processes involved in light activated cycles, pivotal in the design of a photoactive device.
Introduction
In recent years, artificial photosynthesis (AP) has been the subject of intense investigation, due to its potential impact in the renewable energy sector.1,2 Indeed, its final goal is to exploit sunlight to convert small molecules like water and carbon dioxide into solar fuels, such as hydrogen and methanol.1,2 AP systems are generally described as a modular arrangement of key components enabling different functions such as light absorption, energy and electron transfer, and redox catalysis.3 Optimisation of the functional modules is often carried out separately, before engineering the overall assembly. In particular, the development of catalytic systems which enable the redox processes under light irradiation has achieved important results during the last decade.4 Many efforts have especially focused on the oxidation of water to oxygen (eqn (1)), which is plagued by thermodynamic issues (reduction potential for the O2/H2O couple is 1.23–0.059 × pH V vs. NHE) and kinetic barriers. This is due to the complexity of the mechanism where four electrons and four protons are abstracted from two water molecules, while a new oxygen–oxygen bond is formed.5–7 2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e−(1)
As a consequence, in a relatively short timeframe there has been an explosion of scientific reports on this subject, mainly focused on the development of new water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) and on the optimization of their performance, while the reaction mechanism and the identification of active species have been less investigated.8 In some cases, transition metal complexes, claimed as molecular, water oxidation catalysts, were actually observed to undergo a major decomposition in the harsh, oxidizing conditions required for the catalysis, leading to the formation of catalytically active metal oxide phases which were the actual operating species.9–12 Therefore, the questions “what is the actual catalyst?” and “is it a molecular catalyst?” appear to be fundamental ones in this field; indeed, molecular chemistry has great potential to fine-tune the properties and the activity of a catalyst, together with the possibility of identifying the active intermediates and understanding the reaction mechanism, but is often faced with stability issues of the molecule itself, and with good activity of metal oxides, especially when present in nanostructured forms.9–12
One recent example deals with tetracobalt(III) cubanes, with general formula Co4O4(OAc)4(X-py)4, hereafter 1-X, where OAc = acetate and X-py = p-substituted pyridines (X = H, Me, t-Bu, OMe, COOMe, CN, Br), see Fig. 1a. The key motif of this class of compound is the Co(III)4O4 cubic core (Fig. 1b),13 that was proposed as a structural model of the CaMn4Ox oxygen evolving centre (Fig. 1c), operating in biological water oxidation.14,15 More recently,16,17 molecular cubanes were identified as models of the cobalt phosphate/oxide catalyst (CoPi) developed by Kanan and Nocera in 2008 (Fig. 1d), a milestone discovery in the field of water oxidation electrocatalysis.18,19

The water oxidation activity of 1-H was initially investigated by cyclic voltammetry experiments and under light assisted catalysis, in the presence of the well-known Ru(bpy)32+/S2O82− sacrificial system (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine).20,21 A significant effect of the substituent X in the para position of the pyridines on the redox potentials, on the kinetics of electron transfer within the light activated cycle, and on the rate and quantum yield for oxygen production, was evidenced by a decisive role of the ligand pools on the activity of the cubanes.22 As a consequence, further studies were aimed at investigating the effect of the nuclearity of Co(III)-oxo bridged species on their activity,23,24 while the activity of 1-H in catalytic water oxidation was recently studied in a light activated system with a porphyrin as the photosensitizer,25 and in a photoelectrochemical cell, where 1-H was embedded in a Nafion membrane and supported on a hematite (α-Fe2O3) semiconductor.26 Modification of the ligand pool, in particular introducing ethynyl moieties to the carboxylate groups, led to an enhancement of the quantum yield of oxygen production in the light assisted cycle;27 a cubane analog with Co(II) centres and a flexible 2-(hydroxymethyl)pyridine ligand was also proposed as a water oxidation catalyst.28
More recently, the water oxidation ability of 1-X species was severely questioned by Nocera et al.,29 who attributed the major source of water oxidation catalysis to Co(II) impurities in the Co(III) cubanes, that likely evolve to the CoPi catalyst upon application of an anodic bias. Indeed, purification of the cubanes by silica chromatography led to a major abatement of the anodic wave due to catalytic water oxidation, previously observed for the non-purified cubane. Consistently, the activity of the purified cubane was found to drop also in combination with the Ru(bpy)32+/S2O82− light activated system, in buffered water at neutral pH. The residual activity of the cubane (ca. 1/5 with respect to the non-purified batch) was attributed to a specific effect of the strongly oxidizing sulfate radical (SO4˙−, E0ca. 2.4–3.4 V vs. NHE),30–33 which is formed within the sacrificial cycle (vide infra), although the evolution of the pristine cubane structure and generation of high valent Co-based intermediates capable of water oxidation was not excluded.29
In this paper, we have addressed the evolution of the Co(III)–cubane species in aqueous solution, where dissociation of an acetate bridge opening the coordination sphere of the Co4O4 core is recognised as the first event of the cubane rearrangement, leading to the formation of a water oxidation catalyst. The steady building-up of this competent WOC is traced under dark electrocatalytic conditions and in a photoactivated cycle by monitoring the photoinduced electron transfer rate to Ru(bpy)33+. The latter turns out to be enhanced by ca. 40 times with respect to the pristine cubane, and is not ascribable to the Co(II) aquo-ion, which is silent within the flash photolysis time-frame. Evolution of the Co(III)–cubane under continuous irradiation within the Ru(bpy)32+/S2O82− cycle is also addressed by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, revealing the formation of a Co(II) derivative, likely to be involved in the oxygenic cycle.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and purification of 1-X
Synthesis of 1-X was performed according to the literature procedure,13 by refluxing Co(II) ions (introduced as the hexahydrate nitrate salt) in methanol in the presence of acetate (2 eq.) and pyridine (1 eq.), followed by addition of hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 1). The crude, olive-green compounds are isolated by extraction and anhydrification in dichloromethane, and then purified by silica chromatography (CH2Cl2:CH3OH 95:5 eluent, see Experimental Section). As reported by Nocera et al.,29 this procedure is mandatory to purify the 1-X species from Co(II) by-products that are not eluted and remain at the top of the silica column. The identity and purity of the isolated compounds were confirmed by combined elemental analysis, 1H and 13C-NMR, Electrospray Ionisation Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS) and UV-Visible spectroscopy techniques (see ESI†). However, the decisive proof for the purification of 1-X from Co(II) species comes from cyclic voltammetry (CV). Fig. 2 reports the CV analysis for 1-H, as a representative case, in 0.2 M phosphate buffer, pH 7 (a), and in 0.2 M borate buffer, pH 8 (b). In both cases, under anodic scanning, a reversible peak is observed at E1/2 = 1.06 V (ΔE = 80 mV) vs. Ag/AgCl, due to one electron oxidation of the Co4IIIO4 core in 1-H to a formal CoIVCo3IIIO4 mixed-valent intermediate, where the spin is actually localized over the four metals, thus displaying an average oxidation state Co3.25+ (vide infra).29 The absence of Co(II) impurities is confirmed by the lack of an intense anodic wave at higher potentials (E > 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl),20,21,29 which is diagnostic of the water oxidation process promoted by the Co(II) species.29

Evolution of 1-H in aqueous solution
Inspection of Fig. 2 clearly indicates the absence of any electrocatalytic activity of purified 1-H towards water oxidation.29 However, a different behaviour was observed for solutions of the same 1-H batch aged in water. In Fig. 3, the CV analysis of 0.5 mM 1-H in 0.2 M borate buffer with different aging times is reported (1-H is aged in a 5 mM stock solution in Milli-Q water, and then aliquots are diluted in 0.2 M borate buffer, where the CVs are immediately measured).

The inset shows the plot of the intensity of the current at 1.25 V versus aging time. 
Upon aging, an increase in an anodic wave at E > 1.15 V vs. Ag/AgCl is observed, likely ascribable to water oxidation. Clearly, these results point to a steady accumulation of an active WOC upon incubation of the pristine cubane in aqueous solution up to 72 h (hereafter, we refer to this species as active-Co).‡ Interestingly, the amount of active-Co can be conveniently titrated with ethylene-diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), which is known to bind Co(II) centers with a 1:1 stoichiometry, inhibiting water oxidation activity.29 Indeed, EDTA addition to a solution of aged 1-H leads to a complete abatement of the observed anodic water oxidation wave. Modification of the CV features resulting from 1-H aged for 72 hours and upon titration with EDTA (aliquots of a 1 mM solution in 0.2 M borate buffer) are reported in Fig. 4a as a representative case, while the inset plots the current intensity of the anodic wave (E = 1.25 V vs. Ag/AgCl) versus the EDTA/1-H ratio, levelling off at a value of 0.013 (corresponding to a 65 μM concentration in a stock 5 mM solution of 1-H).

(b) Plot of the ratio EDTA/1-H at the equivalence point versus aging time. 
To address the nature of active-Co, in the first instance we checked if hydrolysis of 1-H could be responsible for the release of cobalt aquo ions in solution. In 1-H, all the cobalt centres are in oxidation state III, and reduction of Co(III) to Co(II) is highly disfavoured, since the first wave under cathodic scanning occurs at quite negative potentials of ca. −700 mV vs. Ag/AgCl, in 0.2 M borate buffer, pH 8. However, since the reduction potential of Co(III)/Co(II) aquo ions is 1.84 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (i.e. cobalt(III) aquo ions are strong oxidants) the release of cobalt(III) aquo ions from 1-H should likely be associated with the reduction of Co(III) to Co(II) and parallel, partial oxidation of the organic ligands.34,35§ Therefore, we checked the presence of paramagnetic Co(II) aquo ions by means of 31P NMR line broadening analysis.29,36 The full width at half maximum (FWHM) has thus been recorded for the 31P NMR signal resulting from a 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 8) under different conditions (Fig. 5), specifically: (a) in the absence of any additive; (b) with fresh 1-H (2.5 mM); (c) with 48 h aged 1-H (2.5 mM); (d) Co(II)(NO3)2 (25 μM, i.e., 1% amount with respect to the concentration of 1-H in spectrum c, in order to take into account the 1% of active-Co, formed upon 48 h aging). Inspection of the spectra in Fig. 5a–c shows no broadening of the 31P NMR signal (FWHM = 12 Hz), which is instead significantly observed upon addition of Co(II) aquo ions (FWHM = 50 Hz), Fig. 5d. Therefore, the 31P line broadening test speaks against the release of Co(II) aquo ions upon 1-H aging in water, and that the ligand pool of the cubane likely exerts some coordination motif in active-Co.

Transformation of 1-H in aqueous solution was also monitored by UV-Vis, where a steady increase of the absorbance in the 550–600 nm region is registered over the course of 72 h (Fig. 6). Indeed, Co(II) aquo ions do not display any absorption feature in the same spectral window. An analogous UV-Vis spectra variation occurs when 1-H is aged in 10 mM borate buffer (pH 8), and to a major extent than in pure water (inset in Fig. 6), while no apparent changes are observed in pure acetonitrile. This effect is likely associated with the ability of the solvent to promote ligand dissociation from the Co4O4 core, in the order: borate buffer > water > acetonitrile ≈ 0.

Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was used to gain insight into the possible ligand dissociation equilibria triggering the cubane evolution into the competent WOC. ESI-MS analysis of an aged aqueous solution of 1-H (Fig. 7) shows the expected signal at m/z = 853 ([HCo4O4(CH3COO)4(NC5H5)4]+), ascribed to protonated 1-H (protonation of 1-H is reported in the literature to occur at the oxo-bridges of the Co4O4 core, with a pKa ∼ 4).21 In addition, a second signal at m/z = 793 ([Co4O4(CH3COO)3(NC5H5)4]+) is observed, which is attributed to the ion [1-H−CH3COO]+, where loss of an acetate bridge from 1-H is therefore envisaged.¶ In a theoretical, mechanistic study by Siegbahn et al.24 acetate dissociation was postulated to open a coordination position on the cubane core, thus making water coordination the key step for catalysis. The ESI-MS experimental evidence corroborates this hypothesis as the evolution of the cubane complex to an active WOC is likely to involve the acetate hydrolytic substitution as the primary event of the process.

Behaviour of 1-H in a photoactivated cycle for water oxidation
The activity of homogeneous catalysts in light driven water oxidation is most commonly investigated in sacrificial systems that take advantage of a photosensitizer and an electron acceptor. Typically, Ru(bpy)32+ (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) is used as the photosensitizer, while S2O82− (persulfate) is used as the sacrificial electron acceptor. The photocatalytic cycle in the presence of a generic WOC is represented in Fig. 8, and in eqn (2)–(8). Ru(bpy)32+ + hν → 3*Ru(bpy)32+(2) 3*Ru(bpy)32+ + S2O82− → Ru(bpy)33+ + SO42− + SO4˙−(3) Ru(bpy)32+ + SO4˙− → Ru(bpy)33+ + SO42−(4) Ru(bpy)33+ + WOC → Ru(bpy)32+ + WOC(h+)(5) SO4˙− + WOC → SO42− + WOC(h+)(6) Ru(bpy)33+ (or SO4˙−) + WOC((n − 1)h+) → Ru(bpy)32+ (or SO42−) + WOC(nh+)(7) WOC(nh+) + 2H2O → WOC((n − 4)h+) + O2 + 4H+(8)
 Fig. 8  Representation of the processes occurring in a photoactivated water oxidation cycle, with Ru(bpy)32+ as the photosensitizer, S2O82− as the sacrificial electron acceptor, and a water oxidation catalyst, WOC. The photogenerated oxidants Ru(bpy)33+ and SO4˙−, potentially driving the WOC multi-electron oxidation, are represented in red. See also eqn (2)–(8). 
The first event is light absorption by Ru(bpy)32+ to generate a triplet manifold 3*Ru(bpy)32+ with an energy of ca. 2.12 eV (eqn (2)),37 populated in a few femtoseconds via intersystem crossing from the singlet.38 This excited state has a sufficiently long lifetime (ca. 500 ns in air-equilibrated aqueous solution)39,40 and a reducing ability (E = −0.84 vs. NHE) to react via a bimolecular route with persulfate (eqn (3)), to yield its oxidized form Ru(bpy)33+ (oxidative quenching), concomitantly breaking the persulfate O–O bond to form sulfate (SO42−) and the sulfate radical (SO4˙−). The sulfate radical is an extremely strong oxidant (E0ca. 2.4–3.4 V vs. NHE)30–33 and can abstract one electron from a second Ru(bpy)32+ molecule to form Ru(bpy)33+ and SO42− (eqn (4)). Therefore, from a single photon absorption, two equivalents of Ru(bpy)33+ can be generated; photogeneration of Ru(bpy)33+ from Ru(bpy)32+/S2O82− is indeed reported to reach a quantum yield of 2 in aqueous solution,41 indicative of a very efficient process. Ru(bpy)33+ then oxidizes the WOC to a one-electron oxidised form, generally indicated as WOC(h+) (eqn (5)); alternatively, oxidation of the WOC can be directly promoted by the sulfate radical (eqn (6)),21 a competitive route with respect to reaction (4), where the sulfate radical oxidises Ru(bpy)32+. If the processes in eqn (2)–(6) described above are repeated several times (at least four), the WOC is oxidized to an active intermediate WOC(nh+) (eqn (7)), capable of oxidizing water to oxygen (eqn (8)). Oxidation of the WOC by sulfate radicals is particularly important to activate WOC operating at high potentials (and thus, not oxidizable directly by Ru(bpy)33+, E = 1.26 vs. NHE in aqueous solution), or WOC displaying slow electron transfer kinetics to Ru(bpy)33+. In the particular case of 1-H as the WOC, a direct role of persulfate in oxidizing 1-H was envisaged on the basis of the high operating potential of 1-H, and on the basis of flash photolysis experiments that evidenced a progressive reduction of the secondary process in eqn (4) in the presence of increasing aliquots of 1-H.21
In the photocatalytic cycle described in eqn (2)–(8), several parameters are important to address the efficiency of the system:
(i) the rate of electron transfer from the WOC to Ru(bpy)33+ (hole scavenging) that is usually characterised by a bimolecular rate constant;42–45 a high rate of hole scavenging is functional in activating the WOC, but also in preserving the integrity of the photosensitizer, since it limits competitive pathways leading to degradation of Ru(bpy)33+;42–45
(ii) the total amount of oxygen produced, and the derived value of turnover number (TON), given as the ratio of oxygen and the amount of catalyst;
(iii) the maximum rate of oxygen production RMAX that is then associated with the turnover frequency (TOF) of the catalyst, calculated from the ratio of RMAX and the amount of the catalyst;
(iv) the quantum yield for oxygen production (ϕ), defined as the ratio between the amount of oxygen produced and the photons absorbed by the system (eqn (9)). (9)
In the Ru(bpy)32+/persulfate system, since absorption of one photon can lead to the generation of two equivalents of oxidant (either Ru(bpy)33+ or the sulfate radical), and since four oxidising equivalents are required to oxidise water to oxygen, the theoretical maximum value for the quantum yield is 0.50.45
The activity of 1-H in the photoactivated cycle has been re-evaluated according to these parameters, considering also the aging process of 1-H, and comparing the results obtained for free Co(II) ions, introduced as cobalt(II) nitrate, hexahydrate salt.

Electron transfer kinetics (hole scavenging). 
As anticipated above, one of the crucial steps in the light activated cycle is the electron transfer rate from the catalyst to the oxidized photosensitizer, Ru(bpy)33+; high electron transfer rates help in preserving the photosensitizer from competitive degradation pathways.42–45 The electron transfer rates can be determined by nanosecond laser flash photolysis, where a suitable amount of Ru(bpy)33+ is photo-generated within a few ns (λexc = 355 nm) according to eqn (2)–(4) upon excitation of Ru(bpy)32+ in the presence of S2O82−. Generation of Ru(bpy)33+ is monitored by a decrease in absorbance (bleaching) of the typical metal-to-ligand charge-transfer absorption of the Ru(bpy)32+ at λ = 450 nm. In the presence of a WOC performing electron transfer to Ru(bpy)33+, a bleach recovery is observed, indicative of the formation of Ru(bpy)32+, concomitant to the generation of the oxidised form of the WOC (eqn (5)). By running the experiment at different concentrations of the WOC, and working under pseudo-first-order kinetic conditions ([WOC] ≫ [Ru(bpy)33+]), a second-order rate constant for the process in eqn (5) can be determined.
As expected, the kinetic traces of the Ru(bpy)33+ reduction (Fig. 9) obtained with fresh 1-H at different concentrations can be reasonably fitted by means of single-exponential functions, according to eqn (10). [Ru(bpy)33+] = [Ru(bpy)33+]0 exp(−kobst) + y0(10) kobs = k × [WOC](11)
 Fig. 9  Kinetic traces at 450 nm, with related single-exponential fittings, obtained by laser flash photolysis experiments (excitation at 355 nm, FWHM = 8 ns) on 10 mM borate buffer (pH 8) solutions containing 50 μM Ru(bpy)32+, 5 mM Na2S2O8, and 0–100 μM 1-H (from a 5 mM freshly-prepared solution). 
Under pseudo-first order kinetic conditions, the pseudo-first order rates kobs can be then divided by the 1-H concentration, according to eqn (11), and a bimolecular rate constant of k = 1.7 × 107 M−1 s−1 can be estimated for the electron transfer process from the fresh 1-H to the photogenerated Ru(bpy)33+ oxidant in 10 mM borate buffer solutions (pH 8), in perfect agreement with the value obtained previously.21 The absence of complete recovery of the MLCT bleaching at 450 nm in the presence of 1-H can be attributed to the poor driving force dictating the electron transfer process (ΔGET ≈ 0 eV, according to electrochemistry data and without electrostatic correction applied), suggesting that the one electron oxidation of 1-H by Ru(bpy)33+ could be better described as an equilibrium process rather than an irreversible redox reaction.21||
Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 10, evident changes in the Ru(bpy)33+ reduction kinetics can be observed in the presence of aged 1-H (similarly to the CV experiments, 1-H is aged from a 5 mM stock solution in pure water, and then diluted in 10 mM borate buffer solutions containing the appropriate amounts of Ru(bpy)32+ and persulfate). In particular, (i) faster reduction rates are detected with increasing aging time up to 48 h, (ii) the fraction of recovered Ru(bpy)33+ increases when the aging time is prolonged, (iii) at both 24 and 48 h aging a single-exponential function is not sufficient to reasonably account for the decay of the Ru(bpy)33+ transient species.
 Fig. 10  Kinetic traces at 450 nm obtained by laser flash photolysis (excitation at 355 nm, FWHM = 8 ns) on 10 mM borate buffer (pH 8) solutions containing 50 μM Ru(bpy)32+, 5 mM Na2S2O8, and 100 μM 1-H at different aging times 0–48 h (from a 5 mM stock solution in water). 
All together, these observations are consistent with the evolution of 1-H in water solutions upon aging with the formation of active-Co, capable of fast hole-scavenging from the photogenerated Ru(bpy)33+ oxidant. On a more quantitative basis, from the kinetic traces of Fig. 10, it is also possible to roughly estimate the bimolecular rate constant of the hole transfer process from Ru(bpy)33+ to the active-Co species formed upon 1-H aging. This estimate can be performed by evaluating the difference between the initial rates of Ru(bpy)33+ reduction at 0 and 48 h aging and considering the 1 μM concentration of active-Co formed from a 100 μM total concentration of 1-H after 48 h aging.** This allows us to obtain a bimolecular rate constant of k = 8 × 108 M−1 s−1 for the hole transfer process from the photogenerated Ru(bpy)33+ to the active-Co species, which is ca. 40 times higher than the bimolecular rate constant of the hole transfer process involving 1-H. It is worth recalling that free Co(II) aquo ions give a negligible hole scavenging activity from Ru(bpy)33+ under similar conditions in a comparable timeframe,44 thus confirming that a different species originates from 1-H aging in water solution.


Light-driven water oxidation. 
While hole scavenging kinetics are related to the primary events occurring in the light activated cycle, the actual, oxygenic ability of 1-H was investigated by continuous irradiation of 1-H/Ru(bpy)32+/S2O82− solutions, simultaneously measuring O2 formation by means of a fluorescence detector mounted in the headspace of a home-made glass reactor (Table 1). The amounts of the photosensitizer Ru(bpy)32+ and of the sacrificial electron acceptor S2O82− were fixed at 1 mM and 5 mM concentration, respectively,20–23 while the catalysts were introduced at different concentrations (for 1-H, the range of the concentration investigated was 18–500 μM, entries 1–4 in Table 1). The first, clear evidence from the kinetic results, is that when employed at concentrations typically used in experiments of this type,20–23,46,471-H displays very poor oxygenic activity (entry 1 in Table 1, black trace in Fig. 11); for the sake of comparison, when Co(II) is used as the catalyst at the same total cobalt concentration (1-H being a tetrametallic species, a 18 μM concentration of 1-H corresponds to a total cobalt concentration of 72 μM), ca. 35-fold higher amount of oxygen is produced (entry 6 in Table 1, blue trace in Fig. 11), reaching a notable quantum yield of 0.11.45 When the concentration of 1-H is raised (72–500 μM, entries 2–4 in Table 1, see also the red and purple traces in Fig. 11), a sustained oxygen production is observed. Although the process is subcatalytic, with a formal turnover number per cobalt centre of up to 0.58 and a turnover frequency three orders of magnitude below literature benchmarks,20–23,46,47 the system reaches a notable quantum yield of 0.067 when 1-H is introduced at 180 μM concentration (entry 3 in Table 1, purple trace in Fig. 11).††

 Fig. 11  Oxygen evolution kinetics from 15 mL of 10 mM borate buffer, [Ru(bpy)32+] 1 mM, [S2O82−] 5 mM, in the presence of 18, 72 and 180 μM 1-H (black, red and purple traces, respectively) or 72 mM Co(II) (blue trace). Illumination is performed with a series of six LEDs (total power 42 mW, 7 mW per single LED), corresponding to 9.5 × 1016 photons per s (1.58 × 10−7 einstein per s) at 450 nm. 
Interestingly, use of aged solutions of 1-H does not lead to significant changes in the oxygenic performance (entries 4–5 in Table 1). Therefore, the presence of active-Co (at least in the adopted conditions of entry 5, where it is present in 1% amount with respect to 1-H) does not lead to a net improvement in the oxygenic catalysis, suggesting that under continuous light irradiation, evolution of 1-H to active intermediates capable of water oxidation occurs rapidly. Indeed, ESI-MS analysis of the reaction mixture in entry 4 in Table 1 over the course of photoirradiation shows the prompt building up of the peak at m/z = 793 [1-H−CH3COO]+ (ESI†) due to loss of an acetate group from the cubane, which was previously observed to initiate the slow, dark evolution of 1-H in aqueous media (see discussion above).
In order to shine light on the building up of the catalytic intermediates in the 1-H/Ru(bpy)32+/S2O82− three-component system, we followed the photoreaction by continuous-wave EPR. Fig. 12a shows the spectral evolution upon irradiation of a solution containing 100 μM 1-H, 0.5 mM Ru(bpy)32+ and S2O82− 1.25 mM in 50:50 acetonitrile:10 mM borate buffer, pH 8. As expected, the initial spectrum, registered for the solution maintained under dark conditions, does not show any significant features due to the diamagnetic nature of both 1-H and Ru(bpy)32+. In the first 10 minutes of illumination (the irradiation was performed with a series of monochromatic LEDs emitting at 450 nm), two distinct raising signals are observed. The first one is an axial signal characterised by a g⊥ ∼ 2.5, typical of the Ru(III) form of the photosensitizer,48 confirming its photogeneration in this system (eqn (2)–(4)). The second signal has an approximately axial line shape, with g⊥ = 2.33 and g‖ = 2.07 (according to spectral simulations, see Fig. 12b); this signal is attributed to the one-electron oxidised form of the cubane, 1-H+, with total electron spin S = 1/2 and formal oxidation states of (III, III, III, IV) for the cobalt centres, even though the spin is localized over the four metals; thus the average oxidation state is Co3.25+.49 This signal is persistent in the initial period of illumination, and therefore confirms the effective oxidation of 1-H by the photogenerated Ru(bpy)33+ (see above discussion). However, after 20 minutes of irradiation, a third, broad signal appears with g ≫ 4.5 assigned to S = 3/2 Co(II); this is in line with the formation of Co(II) species,46,50 likely originating from rearrangement of 1-H; indeed, its appearance is concomitant to the decrease of the signal of 1-H+.‡‡ At first sight, generation of a Co(II) species from 1-H under oxidising conditions could appear counter-intuitive. However, this Co(II) species could likely be the resting state of an active species, originated from the cubane, and operating in the light activated cycle.

Conclusions
Nowadays, the question of whether it is worth designing and spending synthetic efforts on the development of molecular water oxidation catalysts is a very relevant, open one. In this paper, we have addressed the partial evolution of molecular Co(III) cubanes in aqueous media to an active-Co species enabling water oxidation. Several lines of evidence (31P line broadening analysis, UV-Vis spectroscopy, ESI-MS spectrometry) speak against the release of cobalt aquo ions by hydrolysis of the cubane, and are instead indicative of a species where the original ligand pool of 1-H still affects the catalytic behaviour. In particular, with respect to the pristine 1-H, active-Co shows a strongly enhanced electron transfer rate to photogenerated Ru(bpy)33+ (hole scavenging), with an estimated bimolecular rate constant 8 × 108 M−1 s−1. The hole scavenging rate is one of the parameters where well-defined, molecular species may display superior activity to metal oxides; in some cases this rate is slow, despite synthetic efforts to engineer the stabilizing ligand pool.50 Therefore, the design of molecular species should still be relevant, in order to optimize the interface of the catalyst/photosensitizer modules51 within an artificial photosynthetic architecture.
Experimental section
General methods
Reactions were monitored by analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using silica gel 60 F254 pre-coated aluminum sheets and visualized using UV light. Proton NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV300 spectrometer operating at 300 MHz. Proton chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (δ) with the solvent reference relative to tetramethylsilane (TMS) employed as the internal standard (CDCl3δ = 7.26 ppm). 13C NMR spectra were recorded on 300 MHz spectrometer operating at 75 MHz with complete proton decoupling. Carbon chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (δ) relative to TMS. UV-Vis kinetic experiments were collected using a Varian Cary-100 Scan spectrophotometer using a 1 mL cell with an optical path length of 1 cm or a 500 μL cell with a length of 1 mm. ESI-MS spectra were recorded on an Agilent 1100 series LC/MSD trap SL spectrometer. Elemental analyses were performed using a Thermo Scientific Flash 2000 Analyzer.
Starting materials
Cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate, sodium acetate trihydrate, hydrogen peroxide solution (30% (w/w) in H2O), pyridine, 4-methylpyridine, 4-tert-butylpyridine, 4-methoxypyridine, 4-pyridinecarbonitrile, 4-bromopyridine hydrochloride, isonicotinic acid, thionyl chloride and triethylamine were obtained commercially as high-purity products and used as received; all solvents were used as received as technical grade solvents.
Synthesis of isonicotinic acid methyl ester
Thionyl chloride (4.2 mL, 57 mmol) was added to the isonicotinic acid (1.00 g, 8 mmol) under an inert atmosphere; the reaction mixture was then heated to reflux and stirred at that temperature for 2 h 30 min. The reaction was allowed to cool to room temperature and the residual thionyl chloride was removed under a high flux of nitrogen. The resulting solid was dried under vacuum for 2 min, dissolved in methanol (25 mL) at 0 °C and triethylamine (1.4 mL, 10 mmol) was added. Subsequently, the reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for 18 h. After this time the reaction was quenched with NaHCO3 s.s. (5 mL) and extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 30 mL). The combined organic solution was dried over dry Na2SO4, filtered and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel with a 95:5 DCM:MeOH mixture as eluent. The purification afforded the desired product in 89% yield. Rf = 0.73 (DCM/MeOH 95:5). 1H-NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3): δ 8.75 (d, 2H, J = 4.6 Hz), 7.81 (d, 2H, J = 4.6 Hz), 3.93 (s, 3H).

Complexes 1-X were synthesized according to a modified literature procedure.13 Co(NO3)2·6H2O (2.90 g, 10 mmol) and CH3CO2Na·3H2O (2.70 g, 20 mmol) were dissolved in methanol (30 mL) and heated to reflux temperature. The respective para substituted pyridine (10 mmol) was then added to the stirred reaction mixture, followed by dropwise addition of an excess of hydrogen peroxide (9.8 M, 4.6 mL, 45 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred under reflux for 4 h, then allowed to cool to room temperature. The reaction mixture was then diluted with Milli-Q water (5 mL) and extracted with dichloromethane (150 mL). The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by column chromatography with different dichloromethane:methanol mixtures as eluent (see below) to afford the pure product.

Light-driven oxidation of water. 
In a typical experiment, 15 mL of a 10 mM borate aqueous buffer containing [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2·6H2O (1 mM), Na2S2O8 (5 mM) and the catalyst were introduced into a glass reactor (internal diameter 18 mm, total internal volume of 24 mL), deoxygenated with nitrogen and allowed to equilibrate at 25 °C with light being completely excluded. The solution was then irradiated with a series of six monochromatic LEDs emitting at 450 nm (LED450-06 from Roithner Lasertechnik GmbH). Oxygen evolution was monitored with a FOXY-R-AF probe mounted into the reaction headspace and interfaced with Neofox Real-Time software for data collection.


Electrochemistry. 
Cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed using a BAS EC-epsilon potentiostat, in a three-electrode electrochemical cell. Working electrode: glassy carbon (3 mm diameter, geometric surface area = 7 mm2); counter electrode: Pt wire; reference electrode: Ag/AgCl (3 M NaCl); scan rate: 100 mV s−1.


Laser flash photolysis. 
Nanosecond transient measurements were performed with a custom laser spectrometer comprising a Continuum Surelite II Nd:YAG laser (FWHM 6–8 ns) with frequency doubled (532 nm, 330 mJ) or tripled (355 nm, 160 mJ) option, an Applied Photophysics xenon light source including a mod. 720 150 W lamp housing, a mod. 620 power controlled lamp supply and a mod. 03-102 arc lamp pulser. Laser excitation was provided at 90° with respect to the white light probe beam. Light transmitted by the sample was focused onto the entrance slit of a 300 mm focal length Acton SpectraPro 2300i triple grating, flat field, double exit monochromator equipped with a photomultiplier detector (Hamamatsu R3896). Signals from the photomultiplier (kinetic traces) were processed by means of a LeCroy 9360 (600 MHz, 5 Gs s−1) digital oscilloscope. The white light probe was filtered in order to minimize decomposition of the sample using a band pass filter centered at 450 nm (FWHM = 10 nm).


EPR. 
X-band continuous-wave EPR spectra were recorded with a Bruker ELEXSYS E580 spectrometer equipped with an ER4102ST cavity operating at 9.38 GHz. Cryogenic temperatures were achieved by using a liquid helium flow cryostat (Oxford Instruments ESR-900) driven by a temperature controller (Oxford Instruments ITC503). The experimental conditions were the following: T = 10 K, non-saturating microwave power: 2 mW, modulation amplitude: 10 G, conversion time: 81.92 ms and time constant: 163.84 ms. Simulations of the CW EPR spectra, to obtain the g-tensor principal components, were performed by using the Easyspin routine in Matlab®. g values were estimated by calibration using a sample of strong pitch.

See DOI: 10.1039/c5fd00076a‡ Formation of Co-based WOCs results from the degradation of Co(III) dimers and trimers with a similar ligand pool, induced by bulk electrolysis at anodic potentials.23 Moreover, active cobalt-oxide layers are produced by Co aquo ion electrodeposition under anodic scanning, and in the presence of proton accepting electrolytes.18,19§ Reduction potentials of Co(III)/Co(II) couples are reported to be strongly dependent on the ligand pool;34,35 in particular, pyridine is recognised as a ligand that enhances the reduction potential of the Co(III)/Co(II) couple.34¶ Although this process could occur during the ionization step (since traces of the signal at m/z = 793 are also observed in fresh solutions of 1-H), the higher intensity observed in the spectrum of the aged solution of 1-H speaks in favour of a partial leaching of the carboxylate ligand in aqueous solution, as the primary step of 1-H decomposition.|| A complete recovery of the bleach was instead observed in 50:50 acetonitrile:10 mM borate buffer, pH 8, due to enhanced driving force for the electron transfer.22 Indeed, this was confirmed to occur for all 1-X species, with conservation of the Hammett plot of the kinetic constants (see ESI†).** Extrapolation of the bimolecular rate constant of the hole transfer process from Ru(bpy)33+ to active-Co cannot be easily performed by fitting the decay in Fig. 10 at 48 h aging due to the complex model necessary to describe the kinetics (i.e., a sum of a pseudo-first order and a second-order kinetics). A rough estimate, however, can be performed as follows: at 48 h aging, the rate R of Ru(bpy)33+ reduction is indeed the sum of R1 and R2, where R1 is the rate of Ru(bpy)33+ reduction by 1-H and R2 is the rate of Ru(bpy)33+ reduction by active-Co. Assuming zero-order kinetics at the very beginning of the decays, R = 0.033 M s−1 can be calculated as an “initial rate” from the linear fit of the dark yellow trace in Fig. 10 between 0 and 200–300 μs, and R1 = 0.021 M s−1 can be calculated as an “initial rate” from the linear fit of the blue trace in Fig. 10. The difference R − R1 yields R2 = 0.012 M s−1 with R2 = k[Ru(bpy)33+][active-Co], which, considering [Ru(bpy)33+] = 15 μM as the initial concentration of photogenerated oxidant (calculated from ΔOD, Δε = 13000 M−1 cm−1, and the appropriate correction for the ratio between the volume of solution probed by the analyzing beam and that excited by the laser pulse)43 and [active-Co] = 1 μM (according to the active-Co/[1-H] ratio at 48 h aging from EDTA titration), allows us to estimate k = 8 × 108 M−1 s−1.†† Typically, high concentrations of WOC are not used in similar catalytic tests, due to competitive, unproductive quenching of the excited state 3*Ru(bpy)32+ by the WOC and by its oxidized intermediates, leading to a depletion of oxygen production and of the quantum yield.43,46 Conversely, quenching of 3*Ru(bpy)32+ by 1-H is negligible.‡‡ Cobalt(II) species have also been proposed as precursors for the formation of active cobalt oxide nanoparticles. In this case, analysis of the reaction mixture after 4 h irradiation by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) did not show significant scattering.This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015
