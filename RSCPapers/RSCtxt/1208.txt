    , Accepted 16th April 2021First published on 19th April 2021AbstractThe limited solar spectrum utilization hinders the further amelioration of the performance of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). An up-conversion (UC) process extends the spectral absorption of PVSCs from the visible to near-infrared (NIR) range and minimizes the sub-band-gap photon transmission loss. The perovskite-sensitized triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) from rubrene (Rub) and dibenzotetraphenylperiflanthene (DBP) has shown great potential in UC applications. Herein, the TTA UC mechanism is introduced for the first time into PVSCs for converting NIR photons to visible photons, which facilitates the obvious improvement of photocurrent. Attributed to the TTA UC effect and energy band alignment of the Rub:DBP UC layer with the perovskite, the MAPbI3 based PVSCs acquire a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.18% accompanied by significant enhancements in the short circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc). In addition, rubrene doping can promote perovskite growth owing to the formation of π-conjugated agglomerates, which serve as the growing sites for perovskite crystallization nuclei. Furthermore, the Rub:DBP-based unencapsulated devices exhibit excellent moisture stability, and maintain more than 80% of the primitive PCE after 14 days of storage under air conditions (50–70% humidity, 25 °C).

Broader context
The limited solar spectrum utilization hinders the further improvement of the performance of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). It is imperative to broaden the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum response of devices to further improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PVSCs. The present research studies on up-conversion PVSCs mainly focus on lanthanide-based nanoparticles doped in the interface layer to improve the photovoltaic performance while high photon flux is required. Herein, we incorporate for the first time a rubrene:DBP triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) up-conversion layer above the perovskite film prior to annealing via a one-step anti-solvent additive technique. In this way, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) value is enhanced significantly above 600 nm, which is demonstrated to be viable under subsolar photon flux. Attributed to the wavelength interconversion and the gradient band alignment, the TTA up-conversion PVSCs achieve a champion efficiency of 20.18% along with significant enhancement in short circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc). More importantly, the incorporation of a rubrene:DBP TTA up-conversion layer can also promote the vertical perovskite crystal growth and endow the perovskite film with resistance to water and oxygen erosion. The unencapsulated devices maintain more than 80% of the primitive PCE after 14 days of storage under air conditions (50–70% humidity, 25 °C).

Introduction
Organic–inorganic halide perovskite hybrid materials have attracted widespread attention due to their excellent properties of a high absorption coefficient, high carrier mobility,1 direct bandgap,2 and long carrier diffusion length,3 which have raised the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) from an initial 3.8% to 25.5% in the past decade.4,5 Fundamentally, the PVSC performance improvement generally relies on defect passivation and light absorption enhancement of the perovskite layer, as well as device structure optimization.6,7 However, the optical band gap of a common perovskite layer CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) is about 1.55 eV, which only allows absorption of incident light in the wavelength range of 300–800 nm.8 A large percentage of the incident light is lost in the form of thermalization and sub-band-gap photons.9 Wavelength interconversion (i.e. up-conversion or down-conversion) is promising in sub-band-gap sensitization of photovoltaics. The photon up-conversion (UC) strategy has already been proven to extend the near-infrared (NIR) response of the PVSCs, which is competent for converting NIR light into visible light,10,11 followed by the perovskite photoactive layer reabsorbing the emitted visible light to generate extra photocurrent in PVSCs.
There are several different routes to create high-energy photons, including nonlinear crystals based on second-harmonic frequency generation,12 lanthanide-based nanoparticles through the ladder-like energy levels13 and triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA).14–16 Lin et al. employed NaYF4:Yb/Er UC nanoparticles as a scaffold in MAPbI3-based PVSCs, which led to a PCE of 18.1% under additional 980 nm NIR irradiation.17 In contrast to the integration of lanthanide-based UC nanoparticles into PVSCs which requires high photon flux, the TTA UC process in organic semiconductors can be efficient even at subsolar photon flux owing to the energy that is stored in the long-life triplet states.18 As an alternative UC mechanism, sensitized TTA UC systems are comprised of a triplet sensitizer as an energy donor, and an annihilator which is indirectly excited by a spin-allowed Dexter-type triplet energy transfer (TET) process.19 According to the selection rules, triplet states are spin-forbidden via direct optical excitation and only weakly accessible by optical means.18 Instead, the triplet states can be produced efficiently via a spin-allowed TET process, abiding by the Dexter energy transfer mechanism. Therefore, a high-efficiency sensitizer is indispensable to obtain sufficient triplet population in the intersystem crossing (ISC) process with minimal energy loss. Conventionally, triplet sensitization has been implemented by organometallic sensitizers involving heavy metal atoms, which boosts ISC owing to the strong spin–orbit coupling. Nevertheless, metal–organic complexes suffer from losses on account of their tremendous exchange energy between the singlet and triplet states.20 Lately, semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs), including lead sulfide (PbS)21,22 and cadmium selenide (CdSe),23 have achieved efficient ISC processes with negligible energy loss. Nevertheless, PbS NC-based UC devices can exhibit an inferior exciton diffusion length, which brings about insufficient exciton transportation.24 In addition, inorganic cesium lead halide perovskite (CsPbX3) NCs were also discovered to act as triplet sensitizers.25,26 However, one defect of employing perovskite NCs as sensitizers is the additional energy barrier in the TET process owing to the long alkyl chains of organic ligands covering the surface of the NCs. In order to circumvent the matter of inferior exciton transportation in large-scale NC arrays caused by long alkyl chain ligands, we quest for replacing NC arrays with perovskites which possess prolonged carrier diffusion length and free carrier lifetime surpassing the energy transfer time from a sensitizer to annihilator. Unlike the upconverted NCs investigated previously, the initially excited bound excitons can dissociate into highly mobile charge carriers within picoseconds in perovskite films owing to low exciton binding energy.27 Furthermore, spin–orbit coupling is also anticipated in perovskites and the charge carriers can rapidly spin-mix due to the numerous heavy atoms (Pb and I) in MAPbI3.28,29 These impressive characteristics make the perovskite film the most promising sensitizer.
In recent years, Wieghold and Nienhaus et al. have conducted a series of work which demonstrated that a perovskite film can serve as the triplet sensitizer under subsolar photon flux.30–33 Nevertheless, to our knowledge, no literature has ever reported the application of TTA UC in PVSCs. Herein, we investigate the TTA UC in organic semiconductor rubrene (Rub) and highly fluorescent singlet energy collector dibenzotetraphenylperiflanthene (DBP) sensitized by MAPbI3. Considering the specific impact of TTA UC on PVSC performance, we incorporate a Rub:DBP UC layer above the perovskite film before annealing via a one-step anti-solvent additive technique, which shows superior TTA photon UC efficiency compared to the Rub:DBP treated perovskite film with a bilayer structure. In the TTA process, a pair of spin-triplet states on nearby rubrene molecules can annihilate to yield a high-energy singlet state in a spin-allowed process by electronic coupling. Furthermore, the Rub:DBP UC layer can be anticipated to possess multiple functions involved in inducing favorable perovskite crystal growth, passivating defects, accelerating charge transport and improving moisture stability due to the synergistic effect of strong cation–π interactions34 and excellent hydrophobicity of Rub:DBP.35 The incorporation of the Rub:DBP UC layer facilitates more free charge carrier generation, transfer and collection mainly ascribed to the TTA UC effect and the gradient band alignment, prompting obvious improvements in short circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc). Consequently, a champion PCE of 20.18% has been acquired which is superior to the reference PCE of 17.33%.
Results and discussion
To investigate the influence of Rub:DBP on the MAPbI3 perovskite growth, the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of perovskite films w/o and with different Rub:DBP concentrations (mg mL−1) are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The reference perovskite film displays a polycrystalline film consisting of small grains (Fig. S1a, ESI†). At a low rubrene concentration of 5 mg mL−1 (Fig. S1b, ESI†), the underlying MAPbI3 grains are still clearly visible and accompanied by larger grain size. The longer sticks covering the polycrystalline film are probably the agglomerates of rubrene. These large agglomerates are more prominent on the surface at even higher rubrene concentrations (Fig. S1c and d, ESI†). However, the underlying perovskite film becomes obscured, demonstrating the appearance of an amorphous rubrene layer covering the surface of the MAPbI3 film. The phenomenon is in accord with the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images (Fig. S2, ESI†). Furthermore, the cross-sectional SEM image of reference PVSCs in Fig. 1a exhibits disordered perovskite grains, seriously inhibiting the vertical carrier transport. After doping Rub:DBP, the resulting perovskite film exhibits the vertically extended and ultra-dense cross section (Fig. 1b), which is ascribed to the optimization of Rub:DBP being able to achieve uniform perovskite heterogeneous nucleation and assist in perovskite growth as well. X-ray diffraction (XRD) of both films shows similar characteristic peaks corresponding to MAPbI3 and no distinct shift in diffraction angle, revealing that the Rub:DBP additives are not embedded into the crystal lattice and can only accumulate at grain boundaries (GBs) or the surface of the perovskite film (Fig. 1c and Fig. S3, ESI†).36 Combined with cross-sectional SEM images, the stronger diffraction intensity of the (110) peak demonstrates that higher crystallinity and more uniform grain growth orientation perpendicular to the substrate existed in the Rub:DBP incorporated perovskite film. To further explore the influence of Rub:DBP on crystal orientation, we have checked the ratios of diffraction peak intensity. The increased intensity ratio of (110) and (310) peaks is capable of proving the preferential orientation of perovskite crystals along the vertical direction.37Fig. 1d and e plot the 2D grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) profiles of perovskite films w/o and with Rub:DBP, and the corresponding azimuthal scan profiles for the (110) plane extracted from 2D-GIXRD patterns are shown in Fig. 1f. The reference film shows representative diffraction rings at q ∼ 10, 20 and 22 nm−1 (where q is the scattering vector, q = 4πsinθ/λ) acquired at an incident angle of 0.2° (Fig. 1d), corresponding to the (110), (220) and (310) crystal planes of MAPbI3.38,39 The light blue colored region of the Debye–Scherrer ring for the (110) plane displays a weakened diffraction ring, suggesting the random distribution of perovskite crystal grains. In contrast, the bright red area indicates a strong diffraction signal for the corresponding crystal plane with a preferred vertical orientation in the Rub:DBP incorporated perovskite (Fig. 1e). Furthermore, the radial integral intensity proportion in the region around 90° increases significantly, indicating the presence of excellent crystallinity with a preferred orientation perpendicular to the substrate (Fig. 1f). The above results indicate that the upconverted layer intercalation can regulate the perovskite nucleation and crystal growth to obtain a higher quality perovskite film.

As depicted in Fig. 2a, the addition of a Rub:DBP UC layer provides a promising route to reduce the sub-band-gap photon transmission loss in PVSCs where incident photons in the range of 400–750 nm are effectively captured by the perovskite photoactive layer. However, incident NIR photons (e.g., 780 nm) are initially absorbed weakly by the perovskite layer and subsequently converted to high-energy photons in the UC layer, followed by transferring to the perovskite active layer again and thus contributing to the photocurrent. The chemical structures of the π-conjugated annihilator rubrene molecule and the fluorescent singlet energy collector DBP molecule are shown in Fig. 2b. The scheme for NIR-to-visible TTA UC sensitized by perovskite is described in Fig. 2c. Due to the favorable energetic band alignment between perovskite and rubrene, holes can be easily extracted into the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of rubrene, while the 0.68 eV mismatch between the conductive band (CB) of MAPbI3 and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of rubrene prevents electrons from being directly injected into rubrene. Owing to the presence of holes in rubrene, free electrons can be transferred to the bound triplet state by Coulomb interactions to form charge-transfer complexes.40 A little DBP addition is required so that Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) can occur between the rubrene singlet state and the fluorescent singlet energy collector DBP, thereby suppressing the singlet fission in rubrene.41 The resulting higher visible light energy produced by S1 → S0 emission from DBP can be reabsorbed by the perovskite film.

(c) Scheme for the triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) up-conversion mechanism sensitized by the perovskite film. ① Band diagrams of MAPbI3 and Rub show that the holes can be readily extracted from the valence band (VB) of the perovskite to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of Rub, while the 0.68 eV mismatch of the perovskite conductive band (CB) with the Rub lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) blocks direct electron injection into Rub. However, owing to the presence of holes in Rub, the free electrons can transfer directly to the bound triplet state (T1) by Coulomb interactions to form charge-transfer complexes. ② TTA occurs among adjacent annihilator T1 states. ③ The resulting singlet excitons can remigrate and be harvested by the highly fluorescent emitter DBP. ④ MAPbI3 can reabsorb the visible light emitted from DBP via Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). 
To confirm the FRET process mentioned above, the ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption and steady state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of rubrene and DBP in chlorobenzene (CB) are displayed in Fig. 3a and b. It can be found that the absorption band of rubrene is located at 450–550 nm, while its emission band is located at 550–650 nm, which overlaps well with the absorption band of DBP. The UV-Vis absorption spectra of rubrene and DBP films in Fig. S4 (ESI†) are in accord with the above results. Because the rubrene and DBP spectra match very well a fast FRET process can occur between them. Subsequently, the excited DBP transfers its energy to the perovskite through Förster-type transfer which leads to the reabsorption of the perovskite, thereby increasing the light absorption of the perovskite active layer. The influence of Rub:DBP with different concentrations in the CB on PVSC device performance is also investigated (Fig. S5, ESI† and Table 1). The optimal concentration of rubrene is 10 mg mL−1 and the Rub:DBP mass ratio has been controlled at 10:1, which are employed in the following discussion. Fig. 3c shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the reference and fabricated TTA UC devices. Rub:DBP-based UC PVSCs exhibit a champion PCE of 20.18%, which is superior to that of the reference device (17.33%).

Strikingly, the improvement of short circuit current density (Jsc) is the largest from 20.69 to 23.08 mA cm−2. For comparison, we have further fabricated a bilayer PVSC device by spin coating an individual Rub:DBP UC layer, which also shows better photovoltaic performance (PCE of 18.85%, Jsc of 22.28 mA cm−2) compared with the reference device. In order to comprehend the origin for the enhancement of Jsc from the Rub:DBP-based UC PVSCs, the external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of PVSCs w/o and with Rub:DBP have been determined. Obviously, the EQE of PVSCs with Rub:DBP is more superior than that of the reference PVSCs over the 450–750 nm wavelength measurement range. The integrated Jsc from the EQE spectra also agrees well with the measured Jsc (Fig. 3d). In particular, the EQE values of PVSCs with Rub:DBP significantly enhance in the NIR region especially the peaks located at 620 nm corresponding to the emission wavelength of DBP. To further investigate the reason for the improvement of EQE, the perovskite films w/o and with Rub:DBP are evaluated by UV-Vis absorption and PL spectra. As shown in Fig. 3e, a significant absorption enhancement of the perovskite films with Rub:DBP is observed owing to the FRET. The FRET process can occur between DBP and the perovskite because the emission wavelength range of DBP is located at 600–750 nm and has a good overlap with the absorption spectrum of the perovskite. Subsequently, the excited DBP transfers its energy to the perovskite and leads to light absorption enhancement of the perovskite photoactive layer, which is consistent with the significant increase of EQE above 600 nm. Fig. 3f shows the steady-state UC PL spectra under 780 nm excitation for the reference and TTA UC perovskite films via one-step anti-solvent additive and bilayer techniques. The visible emission from DBP is observed at 620 nm which confirms the result of FRET from DBP to the perovskite. Combining the aforementioned J–V, EQE and optical spectroscopy results, we deduce that the TTA UC device fabricated by a one-step method can induce a better interface contact between the perovskite and UC layer because the rubrene molecules cover each individual perovskite grain on multiple sides (Fig. 3g and h). The optimization of device fabrication techniques is expected to further improve the carrier extraction and UC efficiency. These results indicate that the introduction of Rub:DBP can convert the NIR photons into visible photons, thus improving Jsc.42
In order to visualize the universality of improvement in device performance by the UC effect, the statistical photovoltaic performance of the reference and Rub:DBP incorporated PVSC devices is shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The PCE distribution of different batches is shown in Fig. 4a. In comparison to the reference device, the TTA UC devices possess superior PCE with a narrow distribution, proving more excellent reproducibility. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a valid means to garner an in-depth understanding of the charge transportation process and corresponding resistance values. It is conducted with a bias voltage of 0.8 V in the dark over the frequency range of 100 mHz to 4 MHz. The Nyquist diagrams (Fig. 4b) of the reference and Rub:DBP-based PVSCs show only a single semicircle which indicates the charge recombination resistance (Rrec) value.43,44 The extracted Rrec values of the reference and TTA UC devices are 34.18 and 39.30 kΩ, respectively. The enhancement of Rrec is ascribed to the cation–π interaction between the π-conjugated rubrene and MA+, which efficiently restrains the recombination of charge carriers and inhibits the formation of defects. Furthermore, the dark-current measurements of the reference and TTA UC devices are conducted which expound more information on the carrier recombination process. The reverse current density (2.95 × 10−5 mA cm−2) (Fig. 4c) of the TTA UC device almost reduces by one order of magnitude lower than the reference device (9.318 × 10−4 mA cm−2), indicating that more charge carriers effectively pass through the PVSC device instead of direct shunting.45 In order to verify the reliability and performance of TTA UC devices, the time-dependent current density and PCE are determined at the maximum power point. As shown in Fig. 4d, the TTA UC PVSC device delivers a stabilized PCE of 18.44% and a higher photocurrent of 19.88 mA cm−2 at a constant bias voltage of 0.93 V.

(b) Nyquist plots, (c) dark J–V curves, (d) steady-state photocurrent and output PCE (at the maximum power point of 0.90 and 0.93 eV, respectively) of the corresponding PVSC devices. 
To certify that the charge-carrier recombination process is inhibited, the dependence of the corresponding device current and voltage on incident light intensity is plotted in Fig. 5a. The slope of Rub:DBP-based PVSCs (1.77 KT/q) is lower relative to the reference device (1.96 KT/q), which reveals a decrease in trap-assisted recombination under open-circuit conditions (where K is the Boltzmann constant and q is the elementary charge).46Fig. 5b shows Jsc ∝ Iα under short circuit conditions where the data are plotted on a log–log scale. The calculated α value for Rub:DBP-based PVSCs is near to 1, indicating a reduction in bimolecular recombination under short-circuit conditions. To analyze the charge transportation dynamics, the steady state PL spectra of the reference and Rub:DBP incorporated perovskite films are recorded. Furthermore, the hole transportation layer (HTL) (Spiro-OMeTAD) is introduced on the surface of the reference and Rub:DBP incorporated perovskite films to detect the charge extraction and transfer between the perovskite films and HTL. As shown in Fig. 5c, the rubrene semiconductive molecule can act as a hole-transport medium in the perovskite, which leads to faster PL quenching. In addition, the PL of the Rub:DBP incorporated perovskite with the HTL quenches more than 68% in comparison with that without the HTL, which is higher than the corresponding value based on reference samples (45%). And the Rub:DBP incorporated perovskite film quenches more drastically than the bilayer structure film (Fig. S7, ESI†). The stronger quenched PL and bluer PL peak location prove a more efficient charge extraction and transfer efficiency in the Rub:DBP-based device. To gain more insight into the dynamics of charge recombination and UC properties, we turn to the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay spectra of perovskite films which can be fitted by the biexponential rate law:

(c) Steady-state PL spectra of the reference and Rub:DBP incorporated perovskite films and the as-prepared films with the HTL layer. (d) Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of the reference and Rub:DBP incorporated perovskite films. (e and f) Dark J–V curves with the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) model based on the hole-only device with the structure of ITO/NiOx/CH3NH3PbI3 (with and w/o Rub:DBP)/spiro-OMeTAD/Au and the electron-only device with the structure of ITO/SnOx/CH3NH3PbI3 (with and w/o Rub:DBP)/PCBM/BCP/Ag, respectively. 
The fast decay PL species (τ1) can be ascribed to defect-induced nonradiative recombination, and the slower PL species (τ2) is attributed to radiative recombination. The Rub:DBP incorporated perovskite film exhibits fast and slow decay lifetimes of τ1 = 2.26 ns and τ2 = 592.1 ns, while the reference perovskite film displays τ1 = 45.9 ns and τ2 = 430 ns. The corresponding parameters for TRPL decay are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 5d, due to rapid charge transfer from the perovskite to rubrene, early-time quenching is observed in the Rub:DBP incorporated perovskite film. Subsequently, an extension of the lifetime at later times is discovered due to the reduced rate of recombination owing to the residual lower carrier density. To obtain an in-depth understanding of the charge carrier mobility within the perovskite film, the hole and electron mobilities of the reference and Rub:DBP incorporated perovskite films have been measured by employing a space-charge limited current (SCLC) model (Fig. 5e and f). The carrier mobility can be determined using the Mott–Gurney law:  
The calculated hole mobility (1.45 × 10−1 cm2 V−1 s−1) of the Rub:DBP containing device increases by an order of magnitude compared to the reference device (1.69 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1), which can be attributed to the energy level alignment between the valence band (VB) of MAPbI3 and the HOMO of rubrene allowing for efficient hole extraction. The corresponding hole and electron mobilities of different perovskite films are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). With regard to the electron transportation, the reference and Rub:DBP treated devices are relatively fast. All these advantages on the transfer and collection of carriers in Rub:DBP-based PVSCs are considered as the major reasons for obvious improvements in Voc and fill factor.
The existence of GBs is a major factor for perovskite film decomposition in a humid environment as moisture can infiltrate into perovskite crystals through GBs and thus accelerate perovskite corrosion. The stability of PVSCs is a crucial factor for their potential application. It is found that the Rub:DBP molecules play an excellent hydrophobic role in the GBs and the surface of the perovskite. XRD patterns of the reference and Rub:DBP incorporated perovskite films are tracked to distinguish the degradation along with the aging time in air (Fig. S8, ESI†). It can be seen that the reference film displays a reduced peak intensity at 13.98° and a typical PbI2 peak appears at 12.8° after 30 days, revealing the destruction of the perovskite cubic structure. In contrast, the well-maintained morphology and the absence of the PbI2 peak indicate a higher moisture resistance for the Rub:DBP incorporated perovskite film. The contact angle values for the reference and Rub:DBP incorporated perovskite films are displayed in Fig. S9 (ESI†). Compared with a smaller contact angle of 60° of the reference film, the Rub:DBP incorporated perovskite film exhibits a larger water contact angle of 95° which reveals an evident hydrophobicity caused by Rub:DBP. Fig. S10 (ESI†) shows that the Rub:DBP-based unencapsulated device exhibits excellent moisture stability, which maintains more than 80% of the primitive PCE after 14 days of storage under air conditions (50–70% humidity, 25 °C). These results suggest that the hydrophobic Rub:DBP can effectively prevent perovskite film degradation, thus contributing to admirable humidity stability.

TTA UC is applied for the first time in PVSCs accompanied by excellent photoelectric performance. Attributed to the wavelength interconversion and the gradient band alignment, the TTA UC PVSCs achieve a champion efficiency of 20.18% along with significant enhancement in Jsc and Voc. Quite intriguingly, the incorporation of Rub:DBP in MAPbI3 PVSCs not only realizes the TTA UC process, but also promotes the vertically extended perovskite crystal growth through rubrene agglomerates as growing sites. Furthermore, Rub:DBP can contribute to the perovskite film resisting the erosion of water and oxygen. This strategy offers a novel approach in extending the NIR response of PVSCs, minimizing the sub-band-gap photon transmission loss and ultimately facilitating the photovoltaic performance.

Broader context
The limited solar spectrum utilization hinders the further improvement of the performance of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). It is imperative to broaden the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum response of devices to further improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PVSCs. The present research studies on up-conversion PVSCs mainly focus on lanthanide-based nanoparticles doped in the interface layer to improve the photovoltaic performance while high photon flux is required. Herein, we incorporate for the first time a rubrene:DBP triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) up-conversion layer above the perovskite film prior to annealing via a one-step anti-solvent additive technique. In this way, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) value is enhanced significantly above 600 nm, which is demonstrated to be viable under subsolar photon flux. Attributed to the wavelength interconversion and the gradient band alignment, the TTA up-conversion PVSCs achieve a champion efficiency of 20.18% along with significant enhancement in short circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc). More importantly, the incorporation of a rubrene:DBP TTA up-conversion layer can also promote the vertical perovskite crystal growth and endow the perovskite film with resistance to water and oxygen erosion. The unencapsulated devices maintain more than 80% of the primitive PCE after 14 days of storage under air conditions (50–70% humidity, 25 °C).

(c) Scheme for the triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) up-conversion mechanism sensitized by the perovskite film. ① Band diagrams of MAPbI3 and Rub show that the holes can be readily extracted from the valence band (VB) of the perovskite to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of Rub, while the 0.68 eV mismatch of the perovskite conductive band (CB) with the Rub lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) blocks direct electron injection into Rub. However, owing to the presence of holes in Rub, the free electrons can transfer directly to the bound triplet state (T1) by Coulomb interactions to form charge-transfer complexes. ② TTA occurs among adjacent annihilator T1 states. ③ The resulting singlet excitons can remigrate and be harvested by the highly fluorescent emitter DBP. ④ MAPbI3 can reabsorb the visible light emitted from DBP via Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET).
