    , Accepted 15th December 2015First published on 16th December 2015AbstractTwo π-conjugated small molecules, BDT(TTBT)2 and BDT(PTBT)2, based on benzodithiophene (BDT) and benzothiadiazole (BT) substituted with different terminal groups such as hexyl-bithiophene and hexylphenyl-thiophene are investigated for use in solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs). Investigations into the molecules reveal that variation of the terminal groups not only influences the optical and electronic properties, but also affects the crystallization and morphology of the small molecules. The BDT(TTBT)2 device showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.73% as a consequence of deep HOMO (Voc = 0.81 V), improved charge delocalization, and strong light absorption (Jsc = 4.75 mA cm−2) when mild annealing was used as a result of improved texture in morphology, while the BDT(PTBT)2 device rather showed a moderate PCE of 1.22% with a Jsc of 2.88 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.81 V, and a FF of 0.52.
Introduction
Since low-cost energy conversion devices are a prime requirement of today's globalized era, solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) are seeking more attention in the research community due to their potential as a green energy technology and features like low cost, lightweight, and high mechanical flexibility.1–4 With perpetual efforts over the years, significant improvement has been made in polymer-based solar cells (PSCs) with bulk heterojunction (BHJ) architecture; due to improved device structure, novel light absorbing photoactive materials with phase separated morphology and fabricating techniques, power conversion efficiencies (PCE) have reached 10%.5–7 On the other side, solution-processed small molecule organic solar cells (SMOSCs) have equally placed themselves by showing promising efficiencies of ∼7–8% for BHJ solar cells, which is surely narrowing the performance gap with PSCs.8–11 In comparison to polymeric donors, small molecules have distinct advantages like a well-defined structure, facile synthesis and easy purification, which ultimately results in consistency in batch to batch synthesis. Additionally high Voc and hole mobility can be obtained due to energy level tuning via molecular engineering and novel design implementation in the photoactive layer.7,8,12
Although SMOSCs are behind polymeric counterparts in their overall PCE, various lessons learned from BHJ PSCs can be applied to SM BHJ devices to improve their performance.13 Similar to PSCs, donor materials used in the photoactive layer are the key components for obtaining higher PCE in SMOSCs. To address this issue, several small molecules with different central donor core (D) units, such as dithieno(3,2-b;2′,3′d)silole (DTS),14 dithieno[3,2b:2′,3′d]pyrroles (DTP),15 naphtha[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (NDT)16 and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene (BDT),11 are developed with π-electron acceptors to make the D–A backbone structure, since the D–A structure provides a strong absorption at longer wavelengths owing to effective charge transfer characteristics.10 Among the donor core units, many efforts were devoted for the development of dialkoxy- and dialkyl-BDT based small molecules, as BDT motifs have a symmetrical and planar π-conjugated structure, which can promote ordered π–π stacking and high hole mobility. For instance, Chen et al. reported BDT based small molecules having 2-ethylhexoxy substituted BDT as a central core with octyl cyanoacetate and 3-ethylrhodanine as the terminal donors, in which a PCE of 7.38% was obtained for DR3TBDT.10 Further a new BDT based small molecule donor (DR3TBDTT) was reported by introducing a thiophene or bithiophene moiety at the 4- and 8-positions of the BDT unit to obtain greater conjugation length and high Jsc, which delivered the highest PCE of 8.12% among BDT based small molecules.11
Though there have been several studies reported on modulation of molecular properties and structure–property relationship for molecular photovoltaic materials,17–19 the mystery of designing a compound that would achieve high performance is still unsolved. Most of the studies are confined to investigation of different donor groups, acceptor groups, or their combination,20 which also includes side chain engineering.21 Limited attention has been given to the variation of the terminal group and its influence on the performance of molecular photovoltaics. We recently reported D–π–A conjugated small molecule donor BDT(TBT)2, consisting of a dialkoxy BDT unit as the central donor core with triphenylamine terminated benzothiazole (BT) as an acceptor.22 To further study the effect of terminal donor group variation on photoactive materials, we prepared D–π–A conjugated small molecules, namely BDT(PTBT)2 and BDT(TTBT)2, by replacing the propeller triphenyl-amine (TPA) terminal donor unit with a hexylphenyl-thiophene (PT) or hexyl-bithiophene (TT) group (Fig. 1). Phenyl and thiophene were selected for their varying degrees of planarity and their quinoidal character,23 which would affect their propensity of π-stacking with another molecular framework leading to enhanced charge transport between the adjacent molecules. In the present investigation, we focused on the effect of terminal donor group variations (PT and TT) on the absorption, energy level, charge transport, morphology and photovoltaic properties of these small molecules. It was expected that the end-group and the resultant planarity of molecules would influence the optical and morphological properties of the small molecules, hence the efficiency of the corresponding solar cells. SMOSCs based on BDT(TTBT)2 exhibited a PCE of 1.73% with a Jsc of 4.75 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.81 V and a FF of 0.45, whereas a relatively low PCE of 1.22% was observed for BDT(PTBT)2 with a Jsc of 2.88 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.81 V, and a FF of 0.52.

Subsequently, N2-degassed toluene (10 mL) was added. The reaction mixture was heated under reflux for 24 h and monitored by thin-layer chromatography. After the completion, the reaction was quenched with water and the organic layer was extracted with dichloromethane. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure.

Subsequently N2-degassed chlorobenzene (8 mL) was added, and the mixture was stirred for 15 min with flushing N2. The reaction mixture was heated under reflux for 24 h, and was monitored by thin-layer chromatography. After completion of the reaction, chlorobenzene was removed under reduced pressure, and the residue was purified by column chromatography, eluting with hexane/chloroform (2:3) to obtain BDT(PTBT)2 (0.75 g, 60%) as a purple solid. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, ppm) δ: 8.54 (s, 2H), 7.89 (d, 2H), 7.63 (d, 4H), 7.45–7.43 (m, 4H), 7.14–7.08 (d, 6H), 4.2 (d, 4H), 2.55 (t, 4H), 1.87–1.30 (m, 6H), 1.25–1.14 (m, 28H), 1.05 (t, 6H), 0.89 (t, 12H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 100 MHz, ppm) δ: 152.49, 152.33, 145.76, 144.40, 142.73, 138.74, 137.88, 133.17, 131.38, 128.95, 128.79, 128.60, 126.80, 126.21, 125.47, 125.16, 124.56, 123.28, 121.95, 40.85, 35.68, 31.76, 31.26, 30.74, 29.49, 29.07, 24.08, 23.38, 22.65, 14.52, 14.41, 14.11, 11.65.

General instrumentation
Chemical shifts were reported as δ values (ppm) relative to the internal standard tetramethylsilane (TMS). The UV-vis absorption spectra of films or solutions were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of films were obtained using an FP-6500 (JASCO). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out with a TA Instrument Q-50 at a scanning rate of 10 °C min−1 under a N2 atmosphere. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments were performed on a TA Instrument (DSC 2910) at a heating rate of 100 °C min−1 under a N2 atmosphere. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were made using a VersaSTAT3 (METEK) Electrochemical Analyser under argon at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 at room temperature, where a Pt wire and Ag/AgCl were used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The reference electrode was calibrated with the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple (4.4 eV below the vacuum level) as an external standard. The samples were prepared in chloroform solution with 0.10 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (n-Bu4NPF6) as the electrolyte. The surface morphology was measured using a Digital Instruments Multimode atomic force microscope (AFM) controlled by a Nanoscope IIIa scanning probe microscope 20 controller.
Photovoltaic device fabrication and characterization
OSCs comprising a BHJ photoactive layer of small molecules:6,6-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) were prepared on a commercial indium-doped tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrate with a sandwiched structure of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BDT(PTBT)2 or BDT(TTBT)2:PC71BM/LiF/Al. Prior to use, the patterned ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned with deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol by ultrasonication, followed by treatment with UV ozone. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (AI 4083, H. C. Starck) was spin-coated (2600 rpm, 40 s) onto the cleaned ITO-glass at a thickness of 40 nm and dried at 140 °C for 20 min and then transferred into a glove box filled with N2. Blends of BDT(PTBT)2 or BDT(TTBT)2 and PC71BM (Nano-C, USA) with different weight ratios (from 1:1 to 1:4 w/w) were solubilized overnight in chlorobenzene (20 mg mL−1), filtered through a 0.45 mm poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) filter and subsequently spin-coated (thickness 60–70 nm) onto the PEDOT:PSS layer of the ITO. The resulting films were dried at room temperature for 20 min under N2 and then under vacuum for 12 h. The device fabrication was completed by deposition of a 0.5 nm layer of LiF and a 120 nm Al layer. These layers were thermally evaporated at room temperature under high vacuum at 1 × 10−6 Torr. The active area of every device was 9 mm2. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the photovoltaic devices were measured in the dark and under 1 sun illumination at AM 1.5G using a solar simulator (Newport) at 100 mW cm−2 adjusted with a standard PV reference (2 × 2 cm2), a mono-crystalline silicon solar cell (calibrated at NREL, Colorado, USA) with a Keithley 2400 source-measure unit. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was determined using a Polaronix K3100 spectrometer.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and structural characterization
The synthetic route to small molecules, BDT(PTBT)2 and BDT(TTBT)2, is depicted in Scheme 1. 2-(4-Hexylphenyl)thiophene (3) was prepared via Pd-catalyzed Stille coupling of 1-bromo-4-hexylbenzene (1) and tributyl(thiophen-2-yl)stannane (2). Lithiation of compound 3 with n-BuLi followed by quenching with trimethyltin chloride afforded (5-(4-hexylphenyl)thiophen-2-yl) trimethylstannane (4) in 78% yield. 4-Bromo-7-(5-(4-hexylphenyl)thiophen-2-yl) benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (7) was obtained by selective Pd-catalyzed Stille coupling between compound 4 and benzothiadiazole (5) in 29% yield. Similarly the intermediate 4-bromo-7-(5′-hexyl-2,2′-bithiophen-5-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (6) was obtained by Pd-catalysed Suzuki coupling between 2-(5′-hexyl-2,2′-bithiophen-5-yl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane and benzothiadiazole in 45% yield. 2,6-Bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis-(ethylhexyloxy) benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene (8) was prepared by following the procedure described in the literature.24 The desired final molecules were obtained by Pd2(dba)3/P(o-tolyl)3 catalysed Stille cross-coupling: reacting 8 and 6 afforded BDT(TTBT)2 as a violet solid in 70% yield, and under identical conditions reacting 8 and 7 afforded BDT(PTBT)2 as a purple solid in 60% yield. Structural characterizations are described in the Experimental section of ESI.† Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to prove the properties and stabilities, respectively. TGA showed 5% weight loss up to 291 °C and 320 °C for BDT(TTBT)2 and BDT(PTBT)2 respectively, indicating excellent thermal stability and long term utility. DSC was performed at a heating (cooling) scan rate of 10 °C min−1 under N2. DSC traces of BDT(TTBT)2 and BDT(PTBT)2 are shown in Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†). Melting transitions were observed at 207 °C and 275 °C for BDT(TTBT)2 and BDT(PTBT)2 respectively. BDT(TTBT)2 and BDT(PTBT)2 showed crystallization temperatures of 188 °C and 250 °C, respectively. The higher melting point and crystallization temperature of BDT(PTBT)2 may be attributed to tightly packed domains of the molecule, which likely favours a compact intermolecular π–π conjugated structure. Hence, these results indicate that the subtle change in the end-groups of BDT(TTBT)2 and BDT(PTBT)2 significantly influence the molecular packing and crystalline behaviour.

Photophysical properties
The UV-visible optical absorption spectra of BDT(TTBT)2 and BDT(PTBT)2 in chloroform (10−5 M) and solid films spin-coated on a quartz substrate at room temperature are shown in Fig. 2, and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. Both molecules display π–π* transitions at shorter wavelengths and intramolecular charge transfers (ICT) at higher wavelengths. In solution, BDT(TTBT)2 and BDT(PTBT)2 exhibited absorption maxima at 555 nm and 540 nm respectively, which were red shifted in thin films to 586 nm and 560 nm respectively. In thin film absorption spectra, BDT(TTBT)2 affords a higher red shift of 31 nm along with the emergence of a well-defined vibronic splitting peak at 622 nm. Such features are attributed to a more rigid and ordered structure in the solid, which also lead to enhanced π-electron delocalization across the molecular backbone.11 On the other hand, for BDT(PTBT)2, a relatively low shift of 20 nm with pronounced vibronic splitting with an intense shoulder peak was observed. The difference in absorption shifts from solutions to films indicates that BDT(TTBT)2 exhibits better molecular stacking than BDT(PTBT)2. Improved vibronic resolution of the absorption of BDT(TTBT)2 arises from a better molecular ordering and packing (more π–π stacking) in the thin film. The optical band gap (Eoptg) of BDT(TTBT)2 and BDT(PTBT)2 in thin films was calculated as 1.75 eV and 1.83 eV, respectively.

Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements of both small molecules were carried out in 0.1 M solutions of Bu4NPF6 in acetonitrile at room temperature under argon with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 to evaluate the electrochemical characteristics and their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels. As shown in Fig. 3a, the onset potential for the oxidation of BDT(PTBT)2 and BDT(TTBT)2 was located around 0.93 V and 1.18 V versus the Ag/AgCl reference electrode, hence the respective HOMO energy levels are −5.33 and −5.58 eV. These values were determined from the corresponding Eox onset according to the equation EHOMO = −e(Eoxonset + 4.4). BDT(PTBT)2 showed a higher HOMO level, which could be the result of increased donor strength across the molecular backbone, afforded by the higher aromatic character of the terminal moiety.24 The HOMO level of BDT(TTBT)2 was about 0.25 eV lower than that of BDT(PTBT)2, indicating that BDT(TTBT)2 has more oxidation stability. Switching from phenyl-thiophene to bi-thiophene in BDT(TTBT)2 lowered the HOMO energy level and ensured a higher Voc in the device, as it is linearly correlated with the difference between the HOMO of the donor and the lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the acceptor.25 The LUMO energy levels of both small molecules were calculated based on the correlation between the optical band gap (Eg) and the HOMO energy level (ELUMO = Eg + EHOMO). Table 1 summarizes the corresponding electrochemical characteristics, including onset oxidation (Eoxonset) and the estimated energy levels (both HOMO and LUMO) for the small molecules. The energy levels of BDT(TTBT)2 and BDT(PTBT)2 were further compared with that of PC71BM using the energy level diagram (Fig. 3b). The LUMO levels of BDT(TTBT)2 and BDT(PTBT)2 are sufficiently higher enough than the LUMO level of PC71BM to overcome the exciton binding energy and thus ensure an efficient exciton splitting and charge transfer.26

Photovoltaic properties
The photoactive layers (small molecule:PC71BM) were prepared in solutions of chlorobenzene (20 mg mL−1). OSCs with an active area of 9 mm2 were tested in the dark and under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination. A series of small molecules:PC71BM blend ratios were tested from 1:1 to 1:4 to get the optimal blend ratio for each small molecule, followed by thermal annealing in order to evaluate the device performance. The detailed device performance data are presented in Table 2. The current density–voltage (J–V) curve is provided in Fig. 4a. The optimal blend ratios for BDT(TTBT)2 and BDT(PTBT)2 were found to be 1:2 and 1:4 respectively, to afford maximum PCEs. From the device based on BDT(TTBT)2:PC71BM (1:2), a PCE of 1.67% with a Voc of 0.81V, a Jsc of 4.25 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.49 was found. Conversely, for BDT(PTBT)2:PC71BM (1:4), a relatively low PCE of 1.14% with a Voc of 0.78 V, a Jsc of 2.85 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.51 was recorded. The optimization of the solar cells was further carried out by applying thermal annealing conditions (90, 120, and 150 °C) to the solar cell devices of BDT(TTBT)2 and BDT(PTBT)2, since thermal annealing can significantly influence the morphology of the active layers and consequently improve the performances of the photovoltaic devices.27 Proceeding with thermal annealing, when the BDT(TTBT)2:PC71BM (1:2) device was annealed at 90 °C, an enhanced PCE of 1.73% with a similar Voc of 0.81 V, an improved Jsc of 4.75 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.45 was obtained. This enhancement in PCE could be attributed to increased Jsc of the resultant device. When a similar strategy of thermal annealing at 90 °C was applied for the BDT(PTBT)2:PC71BM (1:4) device, all the device parameters were elevated and PCE reached its peak value of 1.22% with an improved Jsc of 2.88 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.81 V, and a FF of 0.52. A further increase in annealing temperature was found to be ineffective, as PCEs drastically dropped in both small molecules. For BDT(TTBT)2:PC71BM (1:2), annealing at 120 °C and 150 °C showed PCEs of 1.49% and 1.04% respectively, with a concomitant decrease in Voc, Jsc and FF, whereas a steep decrease in PCE was observed for BDT(PTBT)2:PC71BM (1:4) with an increase in annealing temperature from 120 °C to 150 °C; PCE dropped from 0.82% to 0.32% respectively, with all the device parameters showing a decrease.

To investigate the photoresponses of the devices, external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices based on BDT(TTBT)2:PC71BM (1:2) and BDT(PTBT)2:PC71BM (1:4) were collected under monochromatic light (Fig. 4b). The EQE curve showed spectral coverage in the region 350–650 nm for both the molecules. BDT(TTBT)2 devices exhibited broader coverage with a maximum of ∼34% at ∼380 nm, leading to a considerable increase in Jsc, whereas BDT(PTBT)2 devices showed maxima of ∼25% at ∼360 nm. Reduced spectral coverage around 450–650 nm causes lower Jsc in BDT(PTBT)2 devices.
Charge carrier mobility
The hole and electron mobilities of the small molecules were investigated by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method. Table 1 summarizes the resulting mobilities from measurements of the corresponding devices. The J–V characteristics of the hole only devices of small molecules, using the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/small molecule:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag, are shown in Fig. 5a. The hole mobility of the BDT(TTBT)2:PC71BM (1:2) film was calculated to be 1.77 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is 102 times higher than that of the BDT(PTBT)2:PC71BM (1:4) film (1.32 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1). Furthermore, from the electron-only device with the structure of ITO/ZnO/small molecule:PC71BM/LiF/Al, the electron mobility of BDT(TTBT)2:PC71BM (1:2) was found to be 1.08 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is one order of magnitude higher than that of BDT(PTBT)2:PC71BM (1:4) (8.71 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) (Fig. 5b). The fact that the hole and electron mobility of BDT(TTBT)2 is higher than that of BDT(PTBT)2 is obviously due to more chain-planarization and better molecular packing of BDT(TTBT)2 molecules, which is also related with relatively high PCE and Jsc values of BDT(TTBT)2 based devices.

Thin-film morphology
The end-groups of BDT(TTBT)2 and BDT(PTBT)2 are expected to alter their miscibility with PC71BM, which may influence the nano-scale morphology of the small molecule:PC71BM blend films. The active layer morphology of small molecules:PC71BM blend films was examined by an atomic force microscopy (AFM) technique (Fig. S5 in ESI†). In BDT(TTBT)2, an optimal photoactive blend ratio of 1:2 is required to obtain good compatibility of donor and acceptor phase. On the other hand, in BDT(PTBT)2, when excess PC71BM was used (1:4 ratio), it led to the formation of a desired interpenetrating network (IPN) that is sufficient for effective charge separation and carrier charge transport. Thus, for donors BDT(TTBT)2 and BDT(PTBT)2, higher photovoltaic performance was obtained for optimized photoactive blend ratios of 1:2 and 1:4 respectively. Further we characterized the BDT(TTBT)2:PC71BM (1:2) and BDT(PTBT)2:PC71BM (1:4) blended films with and without thermal annealing at 90 °C to investigate the relationship between the morphology and the device processing conditions of the optimized devices (Fig. 6). The AFM image of BDT(TTBT)2:PC71BM (1:2) without thermal annealing shows a distinct morphology, which shows large interconnected domains with a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 1.57 nm (Fig. 6a). On the other hand, the BDT(PTBT)2:PC71BM (1:4) blend film shows less phase separation morphology (Fig. 6c) with a similar RMS roughness value of 1.57 nm compared with the BDT(TTBT)2:PC71BM film. In the annealed film of BDT(TTBT)2:PC71BM (1:2), improved texture in morphology was observed with a reduced RMS roughness of 1.03 nm, and the gradual increase of fibrillary structure became more apparent (Fig. 6b). An optimized donor/acceptor (D/A) IPN may have been formed in the annealed film of BDT(TTBT)2:PC71BM (1:2). This led to a well-defined IPN structure, which ensured a large D/A interface and efficient percolation channels for charge transport, thus improving the exciton separation and charge collection efficiency and leading to high Jsc. This also explains the high hole and electron mobility for this device.28 On annealing, the BDT(PTBT)2:PC71BM (1:4) film showed much lower RMS roughness of 0.71 nm (Fig. 6d). This could be because of high miscibility with PC71BM, partly due to the improper orientation of molecular stacking in thin films. BDT(PTBT)2:PC71BM (1:4) blend films showed homogeneous morphology without any distinct D/A interface, which could explain the reduced Jsc and charge mobility in the BDT(PTBT)2 based device. Furthermore, from SCLC results, BDT(TTBT)2:PC71BM (1:2) films exhibited more balanced hole and electron mobilities (μe/μh = 6.1) than BDT(PTBT)2:PC71BM (1:4) (μe/μh = 660). This means that the BDT(TTBT)2:PC71BM (1:2) film has a better charge transporting ability towards the respective electrode. Consequently, this characteristic led to increased Jsc and thereby delivered a higher PCE for the BDT(TTBT)2:PC71BM (1:2) device.

Conclusions
We developed two moderate bandgap small molecules, BDT(TTBT)2 and BDT(PTBT)2, with varied end groups of hexyl-bithiophene or hexylphenyl-thiophene. Our study revealed that a small change of the terminal group in the small molecular donor materials impacts their optical, electrochemical, and morphological properties as well as the final photovoltaic performance of the solar cells. More ordered interchain molecular π–π stacking and broader spectral coverage from 350 to 700 nm were observed for BDT(TTBT)2 due to its planar and enhanced conjugated system. As a consequence of high charge mobility (μh = 1.77 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1; μe = 1.08 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), ordered crystalline morphology after blending with PC71BM and an improved Jsc of 4.75 mA cm−2, a higher PCE of 1.73% was obtained for BDT(TTBT)2. This enhancement in the photovoltaic parameters of BDT(TTBT)2 devices increased PCE 1.4 times and Jsc 1.6 times compared to BDT(PTBT)2 based devices (PCE = 1.22% and Jsc = 2.88 mA cm−2) respectively. The difference in the photovoltaic performance of the molecules BDT(TTBT)2 and BDT(PTBT)2 demonstrates a rational design strategy for obtaining high performance photovoltaic materials via modification of the terminal donor group.
