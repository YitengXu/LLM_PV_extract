    , Accepted 12th October 2019First published on 15th October 2019AbstractIn this paper, we propose that the microstructural control of (hk1) preferentially oriented Sb2Se3 films from flat films to rod arrays can improve their photovoltaic efficiency by maximizing the carrier transport characteristics. We found that, during co-evaporation, there is a narrow substrate temperature window where the Sb2Se3 rod array can be formed with an (hk1) preferred orientation, thus maximizing the carrier transport characteristics. The substrate-temperature-dependent morphology of the Sb2Se3 films can be explained by nucleation and growth theory and the terrace-ledge-kink model. Dramatic changes in the (hk0) and (hk1) texture coefficients occur at 315 °C, and the critical temperature for obtaining the (hk1) preferentially oriented Sb2Se3 film is a substrate temperature of 315 °C. On the basis of the observed variation in the film microstructure and texture coefficient, the optimum Sb2Se3 rod array having an (hk1) preferred orientation is formed in a narrow range of substrate temperatures. As a result, we obtained an optimized Sb2Se3 thin-film rod array that shows effective carrier transportation. Further, the optimum fill factor, short circuit current, open circuit voltage, and efficiency of the Sb2Se3 device were observed in the Sb2Se3 rod array having an (hk1) preferred orientation, and the enhanced carrier transport characteristics are the main reason for the improved device properties. These results show that controlling the microstructure of Sb2Se3 allows improvements in the efficiency of (hk1) preferentially oriented Sb2Se3 films.
Introduction
Antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) is a typical V2–VI4 binary chalcogenide with a single phase and fixed composition and has recently attracted much interest from photovoltaic researchers because of its high absorption coefficient, low cost, non-toxicity, and low processing temperature.1–6 In previous research concerning Sb2Se3 solar cells which have a 1D structure, researchers have focused on the preparation of flat and dense Sb2Se3 thin films having an (hk1) preferred orientation to minimize the shunt path via film uniformity and pin-holes for use as light absorbers in high-efficiency Sb2Se3 solar cells.1,7–14 Surprisingly, Li et al. reported the highest efficiency to be 9.2% for a three-dimensional p–n junction of an Sb2Se3 nanorod array;15 this highly efficient cell was achieved by applying a TiO2 buffer layer by atomic layer deposition (ALD) to an Sb2Se3 nanorod array synthesized at a deposition temperature of 270 °C. It seems that this great result can be observed because the unique carrier transport properties of the 1D structure can be maximized by the ease of morphology and orientation control at relatively low temperatures, such as 300 °C. In other words, it can be seen that controlling the preferred orientation and morphology is a key point in increasing Sb2Se3 cell efficiency.
It has been reported that the (hk1) preferentially oriented Sb2Se3 films show increased photovoltaic efficiency, and, furthermore, the efficiency of Sb2Se3 increases when (211)-preferentially oriented films are more dominant than (221).16 Thus, strategies based on the control of the preferred orientation of Sb2Se3 have become important. The texture coefficient which shows the preferred orientation is dependent on the substrate temperature, the substrate interface characteristics, the deposition rate, and the substrate thickness.7,8,17 There have been many cases of the successful increase of efficiency by controlling the preferred alignment by various methods.18–21 In addition, in the case of the water splitting application of Sb2Se3 thin films, the mechanism of nanostructure control of 1D Sb2Se3 thin films prepared by a simple solution process was elucidated in detail.22,23
The morphology of Sb2Se3 films depends on the synthesis method, such as close-space sublimation (CSS),11 vapor transport deposition (VTD)9,10,12–14 and thermal evaporation/co-evaporation.7,16,24–26 In the case of the CSS method, growth mechanisms at a high deposition rate and short flight distances should be considered; it was reported that the deposition rate in CSS is at least ∼26× higher than that in VTD and 1413× higher than that in thermal evaporation.27 And in the case of using a tube furnace (rapid thermal evaporation or VTD), mass transfer under gas flow and temperature gradation depending on the sample location should be considered.27 On the other hand, thermal evaporation and co-evaporation provide reproducibility and high-quality thin films due to the low deposition rate under the relatively low working pressure.
In this work, we found a narrow window of substrate temperatures that result in the formation of Sb2Se3 rod arrays preferentially oriented along (hk1), which maximizes the carrier transport characteristics on a Mo/glass substrate for the substrate-type solar cell device via co-evaporation. Compared to the superstrate-type solar cell device (Au/Sb2Se3/CdS/TCO/glass) which shows 6–7.5% efficiency,9–14 the substrate-type solar cell device (Al/TCO/CdS/Sb2Se3/Mo/glass) is advantageous as it does not need an Au electrode and is easy to apply industrially due to the well-established process in thin film solar cells. Applying the substrate structure used in this paper which reported 9.2% efficiency, we investigated the morphology change of the Sb2Se3 thin film in the (hk1) preferentially oriented region from a flat film to a rod array by the co-evaporation method.15 We have tried to explain the formation mechanism of the Sb2Se3 nanorod array using well established nucleation and growth theory and the Terrace-Ledge-Kink (TLK) model based on the Sb2Se3 microstructure change from the film to the rod. In addition, based on the X-ray diffractometry (XRD) measurements, texture coefficient calculations, and observed microstructural variation, it was confirmed that the (hk1) preferentially oriented Sb2Se3 film is formed when the substrate temperature range is 270 to 315 °C, whereas the rod array is formed at a substrate temperature of 315 °C; in contrast, the (hk0) preferentially oriented film is formed at 330 °C. The optimum fill factor (FF), short circuit current (JSC), open circuit voltage (VOC), and efficiency of the Sb2Se3 device were obtained for the Sb2Se3 rod array having an (hk1) preferred orientation, and the enhanced carrier transport characteristics are believed to be the main reason for the improved device properties. These results show that control over the microstructure of Sb2Se3 can additionally improve the efficiency of (hk1) preferentially oriented Sb2Se3 films by forming a three-dimensional p–n junction.
Experimental
Sb2Se3 thin-film preparation
The structure of the studied Sb2Se3 thin films consisted of a soda lime glass (SLG) substrate and a 600 nm-thick Mo layer as the back-contact layer. Before deposition, the substrate was sequentially cleaned in an ultrasonic bath using acetone, methanol, and deionized water. The Mo layer was deposited on the SLG substrate via direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering using a Mo target with a purity of 99.99%. The Sb2Se3 thin films were prepared on the Mo-coated SLG substrate using a co-evaporator system with Sb2Se3 (99.99%, Alfa Aesar) and Se sources. The substrate temperature was controlled from 270 to 330 °C. The substrate was heated at a rate of 0.53 °C s−1 from room temperature to the final temperature. The thickness of the deposited Sb2Se3 thin films was around 500 nm. After deposition, the samples were allowed to cool to room temperature naturally.
Solar cell fabrication
50 nm-thick CdS buffer layers were deposited on the Sb2Se3 thin films at 65 °C for 13 min by the chemical bath deposition method. The CBD solution consisted of CdSO4 (0.015 mol), NH3·H2O (1.5 mol, 25 wt%) and deionized water. Then, chemical bath deposition was used to cover the obtained Sb2Se3 thin films with a 50 nm-thick CdS buffer layer, and radiofrequency (RF) sputtering was used to sequentially deposit a 50 nm-thick intrinsic ZnO layer and a 300 nm-thick Al-doped ZnO (AZO) layer on top of the buffer layer to fabricate solar cells. Thermal evaporation was then used to deposit a 1 μm-thick Al collection grid on top of the device.
Characterization of Sb2Se3 solar cells
We analyzed the Sb2Se3 thin films using various techniques to determine how the substrate temperature affected the chemical composition and morphology of the films and, consequently, the photovoltaic properties of the Sb2Se3 solar cells. The surface morphology and chemical composition of the Sb2Se3 thin films were observed using scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) (Hitachi, SU8020) and transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM) (Hitachi, HF-3300) with a focused ion beam (FIB) system (Hitachi, NB 5000). The crystalline structure of the Sb2Se3 thin films was determined using XRD (Panalytical, Empyrean). The photovoltaic properties of the solar cells were characterized using a source meter (Keithley, 2400) unit and a solar simulator (Newport, 94022A) to simulate 1.5AM solar irradiation. Capacitance voltage (C–V) characteristics (Keysight, E4980A) were measured at 50 mV and 100 kHz alternating current (AC) excitation with a DC bias from −4.5 to 0 V.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows that the morphologies of the Sb2Se3 films depend on the substrate temperature during co-evaporation. Interestingly, it was found that the morphology of the Sb2Se3 film is dramatically changed, even though the temperature range is very narrow. When the substrate temperature was 270 °C, a flat film consisting of small grains was formed, as shown in Fig. 1a. As shown in Fig. 1b, when the substrate temperature was 285 °C, rods were formed in some locations. As the substrate temperature increased to 300 and 315 °C, the number of rods in the film increased, as shown in Fig. 1c and d. When the substrate temperature was 330 °C, a film consisting of a small number of large rods was observed. As a result, it was confirmed that the density of the Sb2Se3 grains decreased and the rod-shaped grains appeared as the substrate temperature was increased.

Previously, the origin of the rod formation had been very briefly explained by the stress induced by the surface energy anisotropy in the CSS method.15 However, this explanation only describes the results that occur under one condition showing 9.2% efficiency, and thus it cannot explain the consequences of our morphology change depending on the substrate temperature.15 In this study, the change in the morphology of the Sb2Se3 films depending on the substrate temperature can be explained using a nucleation and growth model of the thin film.
Before describing the effect of the substrate temperature on the morphology of Sb2Se3 films, it is necessary to understand the film growth step in the PVD method for a full understanding, as shown in Fig. 2a.28 The PVD process, assuming that cluster growth occurs by the diffusion of the adsorbed atoms, can be divided into four steps, as described in ESI section S1 (eqn S(1)–S(4)†). First, evaporated atoms reach the substrate; second, atoms are physically adsorbed on the substrate; third, atoms are desorbed from the substrate; and fourth, atoms migrate on the surface, finally contributing to film formation by nucleation and growth.28 Importantly, the desorption and the migration steps are not sequential processes.

The characteristics of the evaporated atom flux are affected by several factors, such as the source evaporation rate (source temperature), distance between the source and substrate, chamber pressure, and chamber gas composition.28 In our case, to solve the non-stoichiometry problem,25 the Sb2Se3 thin films were synthesized by the co-evaporation of Sb2Se3 and Se sources at 650 and 250 °C, respectively, which are above the respective melting temperatures as shown in Fig. 2b; when Sb2Se3 is evaporated above its melting temperature, the deposition time can be reduced because of the higher vapor pressure of the liquid phase source compared to that of a solid phase source.16 It has been reported that Sb2Se3 can decompose during thermal evaporation at 677–822 K, forming a gas phase of Sb4, SbSe, and Se components.24,29 The film deposition was conducted in a high-vacuum state without any background gas, and the working pressure was about 5 × 10−6 Torr during deposition. Thus, it can be assumed that the mean free path of the Sb and Se molecules is longer than the distance between the substrate and source (50 cm).
During the diffusion of adsorbed atoms on the surface, nucleation occurs. Fig. 2c shows the total free energy curve at different substrate temperatures.30 When the temperature increases from T1 to T2, the critical radius increases from  to , the Gibbs free energy for the critical radius increases from  to , and the density of the stable nucleus is expected to decrease because of the increase in the critical radius from  to , as shown in Fig. 2d and e.30 Generally, as the substrate temperature increases, the density of stable nuclei decreases, as described in eqn S(4).†30 For example, clusters with rA sizes smaller than , are decomposed at T1, while clusters with rB and rC sizes which are greater than , are survived at T1, thus clusters with rB and rC sizes classified as stable nuclei, as shown in Fig. 2d; in this explanation, cluster means unstable solid particle smaller than. At T2, clusters with rA and rB sizes smaller than  are decomposed, and clusters with rC sizes larger than  are survived at T2, becoming stable nuclei as shown in Fig. 2e. After the nucleation step, grain growth occurs because of the diffusion of adsorbed atoms on the surface, so the grain density is expected to correlate with the nuclear density. During this stage, the growth model is expected to be a typical Volmer–Weber mode (island formation);28 the Volmer–Weber mode is one of the three growth modes: Volmer–Weber (island formation),31 Stranski–Krastanov (layer plus island),32 and Frank–van der Merwe (layer by layer).33
The formation of Sb2Se3 rods is caused by the anisotropic surface energy of Sb2Se3, which has a 1D crystal structure.1,34,35 In this case, the TLK model, as shown in Fig. 2f, can be applied to understand the morphological evolution of Sb2Se3 from a flat film to rods with increasing substrate temperature.36 The dangling bonds on the surfaces increase in the order of terrace, ledge, and kink. That is, the surface energy increases in the order of terrace, ledge, and kink. It has been reported that the surfaces parallel to the [001] direction, i.e., (100), (010), (110), and (120), have no dangling bonds, and these surfaces have lower surface energies than the (001), (211), and (221) surfaces, which have a large number of dangling bonds.35 The surface energies for the (100), (010), (110), (120), (001), (211), and (221) surfaces are 0.44, 0.25, 0.33, 0.32, 0.46, 0.56, and 0.53 J m−2, respectively.35 Thus, the (hk0) surfaces of Sb2Se3 might become terraces. The diffusion length and the desorption rate of the adsorbed atoms increase as the substrate temperature increases, as shown in eqn S(2) and S(3).† With the increasing surface diffusion length, the atoms adsorbed on the terraces will easily spread to the kink and ledge sites where the density of dangling bonds is relatively high; the kink sites are more reactive than ledges, and these are more reactive than terraces. Because of the increased desorption rate, the atoms adsorbed on the terraces can be easily desorbed. Therefore, in this step, the growth mechanism is expected to be a step propagation mechanism.28 Based on the Sb2Se3 crystal structure, the propagation direction is expected to be the [001] direction along the chain direction because of the large number of dangling bonds.35 If a nucleus is formed on a terrace, it forms a disk shape, and, subsequently, grain growth occurs again via the step propagation mechanism, thereby reducing the aspect ratio of the rod.

Fig. 2g shows the evolution of the Sb2Se3 film depending on the substrate temperature. When the substrate temperature is low, a flat film consisting of small grains is formed. As the substrate temperature increases, the density of nuclei decreases because of the increase in the critical radius, and the adsorbed atoms easily diffuse to the kink and ledge sites, so that rod-shaped grains constitute the film. When the substrate temperature is further increased, larger grains are formed as rods, which have a smaller aspect ratio than before because of the additional nucleation on the terrace site, as shown in Fig. 1e.
Because Sb2Se3 has a unique intrinsic quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) crystalline structure, the crystalline orientation of Sb2Se3 thin films is the critical factor determining the physical properties of Sb2Se3 thin films and the photovoltaic properties of the Sb2Se3 solar cells.16 To analyze the crystalline characteristics of co-evaporated Sb2Se3 thin films, XRD analysis and texture coefficient calculations for the Sb2Se3 thin films prepared at different substrate temperatures were carried out (Fig. 3).7,37 In Fig. 3a, all XRD peaks of Sb2Se3 thin films can be assigned to the primary phase, and there are no secondary phase peaks. To obtain precise information about the crystalline orientation of the Sb2Se3 thin films, we calculated the texture coefficient of Sb2Se3 thin films (Fig. 3b). The texture coefficient of the (hk0) series is larger than 1 at 300 °C, as shown in Fig. 3d. On the other hand, the texture coefficient of the (hk1) series is larger than 1 at 315 °C or less, as shown in Fig. 3d. Our co-evaporated Sb2Se3 thin films contained (hk1) preferentially oriented Sb2Se3 when prepared between 215 and 315 °C, whereas the (hk0) preferentially oriented Sb2Se3 was formed at 330 °C. A dramatic change in the texture coefficients of the (hk0) and (hk1) oriented films occurs at 315 °C; thus, it is expected that the critical temperature for the formation of the (hk1) preferentially oriented Sb2Se3 film is about 315 °C. On the basis of the microstructural variation shown in Fig. 1, the Sb2Se3 rod array having (hk1) preferred orientation can be formed in a narrow range of substrate temperatures.

In general, when a crystalline film is used, the orientation of the film is affected by the lattice misfit with the substrate, unlike when an amorphous substrate, such as glass, is used.38 When the diffusivity of adsorbed atoms is sufficient, the nuclei will be oriented to have the minimum lattice mismatch, thus minimizing the strain energy induced by the misfit. Thus, it is presumed that the orientation of the Mo substrate and the overlying Sb2Se3 is important. However, as the temperature increases, (hk1) preferred growth is changed to (hk0) preferred growth, and (hk0) surfaces have no dangling bonds (i.e., it has been reported that surfaces of Sb2Se3 parallel to the [001] direction have no dangling bonds). This unique trend seems to be related to the anisotropic properties of the 1D crystal structure of Sb2Se3, and the effect of the interface on the preferential orientation will be studied in future work.
To clarify the relationship between the nanostructure of the Sb2Se3 thin films and the photovoltaic properties of the Sb2Se3 solar cells, we applied the Sb2Se3 thin films as the absorber layer of substrate-type thin-film solar cells with a conventional device structure of Mo/Sb2Se3/CdS/ZnO/AZO/Au. We first investigated the nanostructure of Sb2Se3 absorber layers and full solar cell devices prepared at different substrate temperatures. Fig. 4 shows the cross-sectional scanning tunneling electron microscopy (STEM)/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) images of Sb2Se3 solar cell devices prepared at different substrate temperatures. It was found that the grain size of the Sb2Se3 absorber layers increases as the substrate temperature increases from 270 to 300 °C, as shown in Fig. 4a and c, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4c, when the substrate temperature was 300 °C, the rods were not evenly distributed over the substrate. As the substrate temperature increased to 315 °C, the number of rods increased, as shown in Fig. 4d. When the substrate temperature was 330 °C, the grains with the rod shape became large. The Se:Sb ratio of Sb2Se3 at 270, 285, 300, 315, and 330 °C substrate temperatures are obtained to be 1.478, 1.516, 1.567, 1.511 and 1.506, respectively, by STEM-EDS measurement.

Concerning the three-dimensional p–n junction, the Sb2Se3 solar cells prepared using films prepared at substrate temperatures of 300 and 315 °C had a conformal CdS buffer layer and ZnO/AZO electron transport layer, despite the complicated nanorod array structure of the Sb2Se3 absorber layer. In our previous work, it was found that CdS and ZnO/AZO layers were uniformly deposited on the surface of a nanoporous copper zinc tin sulfide (CZTS) absorber layer, and the three-dimensional p–n junction porous CZTS solar cells showed good photovoltaic performance.39 Compared with the nanoporous CZTS absorber layer, our Sb2Se3 nanorod array has a less complicated nanostructure and, thus, the formation of uniform CdS and ZnO/AZO layers is possible.
From the TEM analysis of Sb2Se3 solar cells, it was found that our Sb2Se3 solar cells have different device nanostructures and interfacial morphologies depending on the substrate temperature during co-evaporation, which could be closely related to the photovoltaic properties of the solar cells. To investigate the photovoltaic properties of Sb2Se3 solar cells, current density–voltage (J–V) curves and dark current–voltage (I–V) curves were measured (Fig. 5a and Table 1). The Sb2Se3 solar cells prepared at substrate temperatures below 300 °C showed similar efficiencies, and there was little change in the VOC. In addition, in the case of Sb2Se3 solar cells with nanorod arrays, which were deposited by co-evaporation above 300 °C, there was a remarkable increase in JSC compared to those of the conventional Sb2Se3 thin films. This enhancement in the photocurrent is due to the light scattering effect and three-dimensional p–n junction of the Sb2Se3 absorber layer and the CdS buffer layer derived from the Sb2Se3 nanorod array. To clarify the light scattering effect and three-dimensional p–n junction of Sb2Se3 nanorod array solar cells experimentally, reflectance of the Sb2Se3 light absorber and C–V measurements of our Sb2Se3 solar cells prepared at different substrate temperatures (270 and 315 °C) were obtained. Reflectance of the Sb2Se3 sample having the nanorod array is lower than that of the flat sample as shown in Fig. S1;† the lowest reflectance curve was found for the (hk1) preferrentially oriented Sb2Se3 nanorod array synthesized at a 315 °C substrate temperature. The origin of the lower reflectance of the nanorod array is expected to be the scattering effect on the surface having nanorods; the morphology of the Sb2Se3 films at various substrate temperatures was additionally confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement as shown in Fig. S2.† It seems that the nanorod array provides light scattering to enhance the optical performance, similarly to Si.40 From the result of C–V measurement conducted at a frequency of 100 kHz, the depletion widths of flat and nano rod films were calculated to be about 193 and 127 nm, respectively, when the dielectric constant of Sb2Se3 was set to 19.8;41,42 the equation constant used in the calculation is described in the ESI section, Fig. S3.† 193 nm is the depletion width in the Sb2Se3 flat film having 550 nm thickness; thus the remaining 357 nm is the area where the photogenerated carriers collect by diffusion. On the other hand, the depletion width of the Sb2Se3 rod array device is 127 nm; thus it can be seen that most of the volume of the rod is included in the depletion width. For the nanorod structure, it can be seen that the photogenerated carriers can escape into the CdS buffer layer by moving only a short distance in the built-in potential area, as shown in Fig. 5b. As a result, it is difficult to clearly distinguish between the scattering effect and the three-dimensional p–n junction effect. Nevertheless, in view of the JSC increase and reflectance curve tendency of each sample, the three-dimensional p–n junction effect seems to contribute more to the JSC improvement than the scattering effect. Thus, the recombination of minority carriers was suppressed compared with that in the thin-film Sb2Se3 rod array absorber layers. This is also confirmed by the reduced series resistance (Rs) of the Sb2Se3 solar cells shown in Table 1. In addition to the improvement in the photocurrent, the FF was also increased for the Sb2Se3 nanorod array, and this is closely related to the reduced recombination loss of the Sb2Se3 nanorod array absorber layer. This improvement in the photovoltaic parameters of Sb2Se3 solar cells is attributed to the three-dimensional p–n junction formation in the Sb2Se3 nanorod array and CdS buffer layer. From this result, it is concluded that the formation of ordered Sb2Se3 nanorod arrays with a highly (hk1) preferred orientation is a novel strategy for achieving significant efficiency improvements in Sb2Se3 solar cells.

It is well known that one of the merits of the co-evaporation process is the reproducibility of the produced solar cell devices. To check the reproducibility of our Sb2Se3 solar cell devices prepared by co-evaporation, statistical analysis of our Sb2Se3 solar cell devices was performed (Fig. 5c–f and Table 2). Interestingly, despite the complicated nanostructure of the Sb2Se3 nanorod arrays, the Sb2Se3 solar cells prepared at 300 and 315 °C substrate temperatures showed a narrow distribution of photovoltaic parameters. This result proves that the formation of a three-dimensional p–n junction between the Sb2Se3 absorber layer, CdS buffer layer, and ZnO/AZO electron transport layer results in a very stable and efficient solar cell device architecture. In addition, as can be seen in Fig. 5a, Sb2Se3 solar cell devices with a nanorod array structure showed evident improvements in the JSC and FF resulting from three-dimensional p–n junction formation. The reason for the reduced efficiency at 330 °C is assumed to be the (hk0) preferred orientation of the Sb2Se3 film. Based on the results of XRD, FESEM and STEM-EDS, Sb2Se3 deposited at 315 °C is a nanorod array oriented in (hk1) and Sb2Se3 deposited at 330 °C is a Sb2Se3 mixed film (flat + rod) mainly oriented in (hk0). Sb2Se3 deposited at 330 °C is considered to have poor carrier transport properties due to the 1D structure of Sb2Se3.16

Conclusions
If the morphologies and orientations of Sb2Se3 light absorber layers can be controlled, the physical properties of the Sb2Se3 1D crystal structure can be maximized. In this study, we found a narrow temperature window where the Sb2Se3 rod array can be formed with an (hk1) preferred orientation, allowing the maximization of the carrier transport characteristics. As expected, optimum FF, JSC, VOC, and efficiency of the Sb2Se3 device were observed in the Sb2Se3 rod array having the optimum (hk1) preferred orientation. In this study, we propose that the maximization of the (hk1) preferred orientation and the formation of a rod array is very important for improving Sb2Se3 efficiency. It seems that the preferred orientation and morphology of the Sb2Se3 film is determined by the nucleation and growth conditions. Thus, as future work, we will apply new techniques to improve the (hk1) texture coefficient further while forming a rod morphology to maximize the photovoltaic properties of Sb2Se3.
