    , Accepted 11th April 2019First published on 11th April 2019AbstractOrganic photodetectors (OPDs) have been widely studied to achieve high performance for light detection. Photocurrent, a key parameter determining the responsivity of photodetectors, has rarely been investigated for enhancing the performance. Herein, three small molecules were systematically designed and synthesized for use as OPDs. Through the introduction of S⋯O non-covalent conformational locks and changing side chains, the physicochemical properties of the materials, especially the light absorption range and blend film morphology, were effectively tuned, leading to enhanced photocurrent and thus a higher responsivity (from 0.07 A W−1 to 0.29 A W−1 at −0.5 V bias), which is among the highest values for OPDs. The mechanism was systematically investigated with different techniques including ultrafast transient absorption, vertical phase segregation, and charge transport mobility, which helps to elucidate the differences of the photodetectors' performances. This contribution presents an efficient strategy to enhance the responsivity and sheds light on understanding the structure–property relationship of organic semiconductors for use as OPDs.
Introduction
Organic photodetectors (OPDs) have attracted much attention in the past decades due to their tunable-band light detection, flexibility, low-cost and large area fabrication.1–9 Many efforts have been made to achieve high performance OPDs with different light detection ranges,10–12 high responsivity, and sharp detectivity,13,14 which are comparable to their inorganic counterparts.15
Responsivity (R), defined as the ratio of photocurrent to incident-light intensity at a given wavelength (R = Jph/Llight, where Jph is the photocurrent density and Llight is the incident light intensity), is an important parameter for OPDs.10,16 Obviously, a large photocurrent is critical for achieving high responsivity. Thus, efforts have been made to achieve high photocurrent and responsivity for OPDs.17–19 For example, Gong et al. successfully improved the photocurrent of OPDs based on a P3HT:PCBM composite via combined treatments of an active layer with solvent vapor annealing and post-production thermal annealing, affording a responsivity of as high as 320 mA W−1.20 Taylor et al. were able to enhance the photocurrent and detectivity of OPDs by changing the ratio of the co-solvent of PC71BM, resulting in a maximum detectivity of 1.23 × 1012 Jones.18 However, the relationship between the molecular structures of organic semiconductors and the photocurrent of OPDs is rarely studied. Thus, developing novel organic semiconductors to probe the mechanism of photocurrent conversion of OPDs is at a high demand.
Conformation is an important structural parameter of organic semiconductors that can influence the opto-electronic properties significantly.21,22 One important approach to tune the conformation is through non-covalent conformation locks (NCLs), which have been used to improve the photocurrent of organic photovoltaics (OPV) by tuning the light absorption, charge transport mobility, and film morphology.23–25 For example, Woo et al. significantly improved the photocurrent and thus the power conversion efficiency of naphthalene diimide-based all-polymer solar cells upon introduction of S⋯F non-covalent intramolecular interactions in the polymeric acceptor.26 Later, Bo et al. reported that the S⋯O non-covalent intramolecular interactions between neighbouring aromatic rings could significantly extend the effective conjugation and broaden the absorption spectrum, and finally improve the photocurrent of OPV.27 Also, side chain engineering is a widely used strategy to improve the photocurrent of photoresponse devices.28–31 For example, Li et al. successfully improved the photocurrent and thus the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells by changing the alkyl chains to conjugated side chains of benzodithiophene (BDT) based small molecules.32 However, these two strategies have never been used simultaneously to tune the properties of organic semiconductors.
In this contribution, both NCLs and side chain engineering were employed to tune the physicochemical properties of molecular acceptors and the performance of OPDs. As a result, the photocurrent of OPDs increased from 2.16 × 10−3 A cm−2 to 7.77 × 10−3 A cm−2, leading to an enhanced responsivity of 0.29 A W−1 for IDT-BOC based devices, which is among the highest responsivity for OPDs under the same bias.19,20 Also, the mechanism of photocurrent conversion was systematically investigated with steady-state and transient optical absorption spectroscopy, film-depth-dependent light absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction studies, film morphologies, charge generation and transport properties, and density functional theory calculations, which revealed that the conformation of the molecular structure together with film morphologies are critical for the photocurrent of OPDs.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
Three small molecules, CIDT-BC, CIDT-BOC, and IDT-BOC (Fig. 1), were synthesized with excellent yields in two steps by the Stille cross-coupling reaction followed by the Knoevenagel condensation (Scheme S1, ESI†). The structures were confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis. All small molecules exhibit good solubility in common organic solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform, and o-dichlorobenzene at room temperature. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S1, ESI†) demonstrated that CIDT-BC, CIDT-BOC, and IDT-BOC possess good thermal stability with the thermolysis onset temperatures (Td, 5% weight loss) of 394, 385, and 396 °C, respectively.

DFT calculation
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level were conducted to investigate the molecular geometries and frontier orbitals, as shown in Fig. 2. It was worth noting that the dihedral angles between the 1,4-phenylene unit and its neighboring core or end-capping group for the three small molecules were significantly different, as shown in Fig. 2b. The two dihedral angles for the simplified CIDT-BC molecule are 38.8° and 18.1°, respectively. However, the dihedral angles were reduced to 10.8° and 2.9° for CIDT-BOC and 10.8° and 0.5° for IDT-BOC. This was ascribed to the introduction of S⋯O NCLs, which was evidenced by the short S⋯O distances (2.72 Å), a length much smaller than the sum of van der Waals radii (3.32 Å).24,27 Moreover, it was demonstrated that the enhanced planarity may lower the reorganization energy,33 which is inversely proportional to the mobility of charge carriers.34 The reorganization energies (λ) of the three molecules (CIDT-BC, CIDT-BOC, and IDT-BOC) were calculated to be 0.23 eV, 0.19 eV, and 0.26 eV, respectively, suggesting that CIDT-BOC possesses the highest charge carrier mobility. Fig. 2c shows the LUMO and HOMO orbital distributions and the corresponding energy levels. It was found that the LUMO wave function of CIDT-BC is localized at the end-capping groups. However, the orbitals gradually delocalized across the backbone along with the introduction of the S⋯O interactions and the electron-donating phenyl–alkyl chains. Thus, the LUMO wave function of IDT-BOC is well delocalized over the whole backbone, indicating that it may be the best candidate for electron hopping. Moreover, the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of CIDT-BC, CIDT-BOC, and IDT-BOC were calculated to be −5.29/−2.91 eV, −5.12/−2.94 eV, and −5.10/−2.91 eV, respectively.

Optical and electrochemical properties
UV-vis absorption spectra of the molecules in dilute chloroform solution (10−5 M−1) and thin films are shown in Fig. 3, and the parameters are listed in Table 1. In solution, the spectra of all three small molecules exhibited two absorption bands in the range of 300 to 700 nm. The high-energy band and low-energy band were assigned to the π–π* transition and intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT) transition, respectively.24,35 It is found that both CIDT-BOC and IDT-BOC exhibit broader light absorption as well as a stronger extinction coefficient in comparison to CIDT-BC, which is ascribed to the more rigid and planar structure with the S⋯O interactions. In detail, the main absorption peaks and onset edges of CIDT-BOC (588 nm, 687 nm) and IDT-BOC (573 nm, 670 nm) demonstrated a significant bathochromic shift compared to those of CIDT-BC (500 nm, 608 nm). Moreover, the extinction coefficient of the main peak obviously increased from 0.42 × 105 M−1 cm−1 for CIDT-BC to 1.30 × 105 M−1 cm−1 and 1.65 × 105 M−1 cm−1 for CIDT-BOC and IDT-BOC, respectively.

The absorption spectra of the small molecules as thin films show broader and larger red-shifts in comparison to those of the solution, with the maximum absorption peaks at 521 nm, 639 nm and 606 nm for CIDT-BC, CIDT-BOC and IDT-BOC, respectively. Furthermore, the large red shifts for CIDT-BOC (51 nm) and for IDT-BOC (33 nm) as well as the vibronic shoulder peaks suggest their enhanced planarity and stronger aggregations in thin films. Also, the peak extinction coefficient of CIDT-BOC exhibits a higher value of 16.1 × 104 cm−1 than that of IDT-BOC (10.5 × 104 cm−1), indicating a more planar conformation of CIDT-BOC. Based on the edge of the optical absorption, the optical bandgaps were calculated to be 1.97, 1.65 and 1.77 eV for CIDT-BC, CIDT-BOC, and IDT-BOC, respectively. Interestingly, IDT-BOC showed a weaker absorption than CIDT-BOC as films, which was different from the dilute solution, and was attributed to the increased steric hinderance of phenyl–alkyl side chains and thus the weaker aggregation. Moreover, spectra of the blend films were also collected (Fig. S2a, ESI†). There is no doubt that CIDT-BOC or IDT-BOC based blend films demonstrate a broader light absorption range than the CIDT-BC based film, indicating a broader light response.
To investigate the ionization potential and electron affinity of the three small molecules, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements employing ferrocene as the internal standard were conducted, as shown in Fig. S2b (ESI†). The data is summarized in Table 1. According to the equation EHOMO/LUMO = −(Eox/redonset + 4.44) eV, the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of CIDT-BC, CIDT-BOC, and IDT-BOC were calculated to be −5.61/−3.42 eV, −5.51/−3.48 eV, and −5.53/−3.55 eV, respectively. It is obvious that the HOMO energy levels were increased upon introducing S⋯O non-covalent conformational locks, similar to the previously reported results.24 The increased HOMO energy levels contributed to the lower bandgaps, consistent with the UV-vis absorption results. Moreover, the larger LUMO offset between P3HT and IDT-BOC will also contribute to the photogenerated exciton separation and result in higher photocurrent.
Molecular stacking
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed to investigate the effect of molecular engineering on molecular stacking, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). It is obvious that CIDT-BC demonstrated weak crystallinity with a low peak intensity located at 6.62°, corresponding to a d-spacing of 12.34 nm. Moreover, the crystallinity was significantly enhanced when S⋯O NCLs were introduced into CIDT-BC, which exhibited a stronger peak intensity located at 5.98° and thus a larger d-spacing of 14.76 nm. In contrast, IDT-BOC appears to be amorphous due to the steric hinderance of the phenyl–alkyl side chains, indicating the effective modification of molecular stacking upon side chain engineering.
Fabrication and characterization of photodetectors
OPDs with a device structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag were fabricated and characterized (Fig. 4). P3HT was selected as the donor due to its complementary absorption with the acceptors. The current density–voltage curves of the devices under illumination and in the dark are shown in Fig. 4b and the data are summarized in Table 2. Under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2), the photocurrent density (Jph) of P3HT:CIDT-BC based devices at −0.5 V was 2.16 × 10−3 A cm−2. Replacing CIDT-BC with CIDT-BOC results in the increase in Jph to 5.71 × 10−3 A cm−2, which may be ascribed to the introduction of S⋯O NCLs. Furthermore, the Jph of P3HT:IDT-BOC based devices increased to 7.77 × 10−3 A cm−2, which is over three times higher than that of the CIDT-BC based ones. Furthermore, all devices exhibited a comparable dark current density under −0.5 V bias. As a result, the corresponding Ion/Ioff ratio at −0.5 V for P3HT:IDT-BOC based devices was calculated to be 1238, which was more than three times that of P3HT:CIDT-BC based ones (356) (Table 2).

The responsivity R, defined as the ratio between the photocurrent and the incident light power, was calculated according to the equation14 below: (1)where λ represents the wavelength in nm. As shown in Fig. 5a, the devices exhibited different photovoltaic responses from 350 to 800 nm under −0.5 V, similar to their corresponding EQE curves (Fig. S4, ESI†). The peak values in the visible region increased from 0.07 A W−1 at 552 nm for CIDT-BC based devices to 0.21 A W−1 at 570 nm for CIDT-BOC after introducing the S⋯O NCLs. Furthermore, after replacing alkyl chains with phenyl–alkyl chains, the responsivity further increased to 0.29 A W−1 at 560 nm for the IDT-BOC based devices. Evidently, the responsivity was successfully enhanced with simple molecular engineering. In addition, the spectral responsivity of these devices demonstrated a dependence on the applied reverse bias (0, −0.2, and −0.5 V) (Fig. 5b and Fig. S5, ESI†), attributed to the field-induced exciton dissociation.36

Specific detectivity D*, another important figure of merit for OPDs, was calculated according to the following equation:5 (2)where q is the absolute charge of an electron, i.e., 1.60 × 10−19 C, Jd is the dark current density in A cm−2, and λ is the wavelength in nm. As shown in Fig. 5c, the specific detectivities of all devices at −0.5 V in the visible range exhibited similar profiles as the corresponding R plots. Impressively, CIDT-BOC and IDT-BOC based devices reached the maximum of 1.34 × 1011 and 2.06 × 1011 Jones, which were much higher than that of CIDT-BC (5.06 × 1010 Jones) based photodetectors. In contrast, the spectral specific detectivities of the devices did not increase with the applied reverse biases (Fig. S6, ESI†), for its dependence on dark current and responsivity simultaneously according to eqn (2). However, the dark current also increased with the applied reverse biases.
Transient absorption analysis
To understand the formation and recombination of charge-separated states in the donor and acceptor as well as the charge transfer between the two materials, ultrafast transient absorption (TA) measurements were conducted on the neat and blend films (Fig. S7, ESI,† and Fig. 6). As shown in Fig. S7b–d (ESI†), all three small molecules demonstrated similar TA signals. Specifically, broad negative ΔA bands were observed spanning over the range of 480–650 nm for CIDT-BC, and 480–680 nm for CIDT-BOC and IDT-BOC, which were assigned to ground-state bleaching (GB) according to the UV-vis absorption spectrum in Fig. 3b. Furthermore, the small molecules demonstrated weak photoinduced absorption (PIA), suggesting that few charges (excitons) were produced. Fig. 6a–c show the TA spectra of blend films. We observed features arising from P3HT with bleaching at 515 nm, 560 nm, and 605 nm, as well as photoinduced absorption in the range of 620–780 nm. This is similar to the TA spectrum of the neat P3HT film (Fig. S7a, ESI†). For the PIA regions of the P3HT:CIDT-BOC/IDT-BOC based blend films, the maximum intensities were stronger than that of P3HT:CIDT-BC at 0.5 ps, suggesting an increase in polarons (free charges) from the charge separation of excitons following diffusion to the donor–acceptor interface, while the decay beyond 0.5 ps reflects the charge recombination process.37 Furthermore, the PIA bands at 630–670 nm were assigned to that of the coulombically bound charge transfer state (CTS) with free charge absorption occurring at longer wavelengths.38 The kinetics of the PIA signals at 750 nm is demonstrated in Fig. 6d with the data summarized in Table 3. Obviously, shorter time constants assigned to the charge transfer from P3HT to the acceptors could be considered negligible due to the small fraction measured. In comparison, the longer time constants (hundreds of picoseconds) were observed, suggesting slower polaron formation and exciton decay, which was correlated with phase segregation.39 It is apparent that the kinetics of P3HT:CIDT-BC was slower than the other two blend films, probably due to its poor morphology.

Film-depth-dependent photo-harvesting properties
Film-depth-dependent light absorption spectroscopy was conducted to explore the vertical phase segregation according to the literature.40 The films were assumed to be composed of n sublayers, each of which has an absorbance Ai (i = 1, 2, 3,…, n). According to the Beer–Lambert's law, the absorbance of the film is defined as , where I and I0 are the intensity of transmitted and incident light, respectively. Therefore, the transmission light intensity after propagation through the entire film is . Accordingly, the total absorbance of the film is equal to the linear superposition of the absorbance of each layer. This spectroscopy has been previously conducted to characterize the active layers of organic photovoltaics successfully.41,42 As shown in Fig. 7, all films demonstrated hierarchical vertical phase segregation. The absorption peaks at around 400 nm were selected typically to explore the distribution of the small molecules in the films, since the main absorption peaks in the range of 500–650 nm overlapped with those of P3HT. It could be found that the small molecule CIDT-BC was mainly located near the hole transport layer, leading to a low charge collection efficiency. However, for the CIDT-BOC or IDT-BOC based blend films, the small molecules were mainly distributed in the middle layers, and P3HT was located near the hole transport layer, suggesting a higher charge collection efficiency in comparison to CIDT-BC systems.43 Obviously, the vertical phase segregation is consistent with the photoresponse of the blend films.
 Fig. 7  Film-depth-dependent light absorption spectroscopy of the blend films: (a) P3HT:CIDT-BC; (b) P3HT:CIDT-BOC; (c) P3HT:IDT-BOC. The spectra were vertically shifted for clarity and the dashed lines are to guide the eye to show the variations in the absorption peaks at different positions. 
Actually, vertical phase segregation could induce vertical variations in the HOMO and/or LUMO levels, leading to vertical variations in the light absorption spectra. The variations in the energy levels have a great impact on the vertical charge transport, and thus the device performance. This phenomenon has been observed in some organic photovoltaic cells.41Fig. 7c shows a larger variation in the absorption peaks at different positions of the P3HT:IDT-BOC film, as compared with the P3HT:CIDT-BOC film shown in Fig. 7b. The variation in vertical transport energy levels induces spatial and energetic fluctuation of localized states and thus numerous local energetic barriers during charge hopping towards electrodes. However, these energetic barriers could be overcome under a more negative bias, which induces a higher electrical field inside the film, thus leading to a higher photocurrent.
Film morphology
Tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed to investigate the surface morphology of the blend films. Fig. 8 demonstrates that the surfaces continuously became smoother from CIDT-BC to CIDT-BOC and IDT-BOC based blend films, with the root mean square (RMS) roughness as 5.50 nm, 4.10 nm and 2.50 nm, respectively. Obviously, a smooth surface morphology is beneficial for the charge collection between the active layer and electrodes. Fig. 8a and d show that large and unconnected grains were formed in the spin-coated P3HT:CIDT-BC films, resulting in an inefficient exciton separation and charge transport. In contrast, smaller domains and fine structures with bicontinuous interpenetrating networks were observed for P3HT:IDT-BOC blend films, which are favorable for exciton dissociation and transport. Obviously, the film morphology is consistent with the performance of the photodetectors.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was also conducted to further investigate the morphology. As shown in Fig. 9a, the P3HT:CIDT-BC blend films displayed homogeneous features with some defects due to the lower miscibility. Furthermore, P3HT:CIDT-BOC blend films showed extra-large phase separation, which is detrimental for exciton diffusion and splitting. This may be ascribed to the highly crystalline properties of CIDT-BOC. In comparison, P3HT:IDT-BOC blend films possessed more clear phase separation where the domain sizes were about 20 nm in diameter, in accordance with the AFM results and the high photocurrents.

Bulk charge transport in BHJ photodetectors
To further elucidate the enhancement of the photocurrents, the space charge limit current (SCLC) method was employed to estimate the bulk charge transport characteristics of the blend films from electron-only devices (Fig. S8, ESI†). The electron (μe) mobilities were calculated to be 5.34 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, 1.14 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, and 1.13 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for CIDT-BC, CIDT-BOC, and IDT-BOC based blend films, respectively. Obviously, CIDT-BOC and IDT-BOC based films possessed higher electron mobilities due to the introduction of S⋯O NCLs, which is beneficial for charge collection and consistent with their higher photocurrents.
Exciton dissociation and bimolecular recombination kinetics
To further understand the exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiency, photocurrent density (Jph) as a function of effective voltage (Veff) was plotted in double logarithmic coordinates in Fig. 10a. Herein, Jph was determined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD represent current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff is defined as Veff = V0 − Va, where V0 is the voltage when Jph is zero and Va is the applied bias voltage. At a large reverse voltage (i.e., Veff = 2 V), Jph reaches saturation (Jsat), indicating that all of the photogenerated excitons split into free charges and reached the electrodes. Thus, the exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiency can be estimated as the Jph/Jsat ratio.44
 Fig. 10  Photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) characteristics (a); photocurrent density (Jph) versus light intensity (b) of the devices based on different blend films. 
The ratio for P3HT:CIDT-BOC and P3HT:IDT-BOC was calculated to be 89.9% and 85.7%, respectively, which are much higher than that of P3HT:CIDT-BC (65.1%), indicative of more efficient exciton separation and extraction for the CIDT-BOC and IDT-BOC based active layer and thus higher Jsc. Furthermore, light intensity dependent photocurrent measurements were also conducted to probe the recombination kinetics. In principle, Jsc demonstrates a power-law relationship with light intensity (Jsc ∝ PSlight).45 It is well known that a relatively weak bimolecular recombination would exist when the exponential factor (S) is close to 1. As shown in Fig. 10b, the S values for P3HT:CIDT-BOC and P3HT:IDT-BOC are 1.04 and 1.01, respectively, which are slightly closer to 1 compared to that of P3HT:CIDT-BC films (0.95). It is thus concluded that the weaker bimolecular recombination for CIDT-BOC and IDT-BOC based active layers also contributes to the higher photocurrents of the devices.
Conclusion
In summary, NCLs and side chain engineering were sequentially employed to tune the physicochemical properties and thin film morphology of three small molecules to be used as organic photodetectors. The studies showed that NCLs can broaden the light absorption range and enhance the charge transport mobility, while side chain engineering successfully tuned the film morphology of the blend films. As a result, the photocurrent of OPDs was effectively improved, leading to a significantly enhanced responsivity, improved Ion/Ioff ratio, and specific detectivity. This contribution presents an efficient method to enhance the OPD performances, which provides an important viewpoint in probing the structure–property relationship of organic semiconductors for OPDs.
