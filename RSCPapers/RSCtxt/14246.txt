    , Accepted 8th February 2011First published on 7th March 2011AbstractReplacing the nonyl groups on the solar cell dye Ru(4,4′-carboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridine)(4,4′-dinonyl-2,2′-bipyridine)(NCS)2 (Z-907) with amino groups results in a marked decrease in solar cell performance. This is despite the fact that the amino derivative (Z-960) has more favourable light absorption characteristics than Z-907 when used with thick nanocrystalline TiO2 layers. Electron transfer to the electrolyte from the exposed fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate is particularly fast in cells employing the Z-960 dye if a compact TiO2 blocking layer is not used. The kinetics of electron transfer from the nanocrystalline TiO2 layer in DSCs employing Z-960 are comparable to those of bare TiO2 and ca. 2 to 5 times faster than for cells employing Z-907. The faster charge recombination in cells employing Z-960 lowers open-circuit photovoltage and results in very significant charge collection losses that lower short-circuit photocurrent. Voltammetric measurements show that surface modification of FTO electrodes with Z-960 results in slightly more facile charge transfer to acceptor species in triiodide/iodide electrolytes in the dark. A simpler molecule, p-aminobenzoic acid, more dramatically catalyses this charge transfer reaction. Conversely, chemical modification of FTO electrodes with Z-907 or p-toluic acid retards charge transfer kinetics. Similar results are obtained for nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes modified with these benzoic acid derivatives. These results strongly imply that surface adsorbed molecules bearing amino groups, including dye molecules, can catalyse charge recombination in dye-sensitized solar cells.
I. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs)1 continue to attract a great deal of scientific attention owing to them having a potential to rival conventional silicon based photovoltaics. Their potentially low manufacturing costs make them very attractive for commercialisation, and certified submodule efficiencies are now becoming competitive with amorphous Si and CdTe based technologies.2
One of the most obvious avenues of exploration in the pursuit of further improving the efficiency of DSCs is the nature of the sensitizing dye. Significant improvements to the bipyridyl ruthenium sensitizer used in the seminal work by O'Regan and Grätzel were made within a few years of the first reports, by replacing CN ligands with SCN ligands, resulting in the so-called N3 sensitizer.3 Later improvements came by optimisation of the protonation state of the sensitizer, resulting in the N719 sensitizer.4 More recently, efficiencies of up to 12% have been achieved using other ruthenium-based sensitizers.5
The fact that bipyridyl ruthenium sensitizers are still used in the most efficient DSCs to date highlights the difficulty that has been encountered in improving DSC efficiency by modification of the sensitizing dye. This is largely because molecules that ought to make good sensitizers based on independent measurements (e.g. luminescence lifetime, absorption spectrum, HOMO and LUMO levels etc.) often fail to perform as expected in complete solar cells.
In order to improve upon current record efficiencies, new sensitizer dyes with improved absorption in the red part of the solar emission spectrum must be developed. An important caveat to this is that other factors such as electron injection yield, sensitizer regeneration yield, and charge recombination rate must not be adversely affected; ideally, these other factors would also be improved, together with extending the absorption spectrum of the sensitizer to the near IR region. In this article, we report upon a detailed characterisation of DSCs employing a new sensitizing dye, Ru(4,4′-carboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridine)(4,4′-diamino-2,2′-bipyridine)(NCS)2 (Z-960), which is structurally similar to conventional dyes known to produce highly efficient DSCs.
The new sensitizer was designed with hopes of improving open-circuit photovoltage (VOC), without having to switch to an alternative redox mediator with a more positive standard potential. To achieve this, electron-donating amino groups were added to one of the bipyridyl ligands of the dye, in order to induce a negative shift of the HOMO and LUMO levels. It was thought that this shift ought to allow tuning of the TiO2 conduction band to a more negative potential without sacrificing electron injection efficiency, while also reducing the energetic driving force for sensitizer regeneration by the redox mediator, which is often viewed as being excessive.6
Unfortunately, improved solar cell performance was not realised with this dye, despite varying the electrolyte composition in an attempt to raise the TiO2 band edge (e.g. exclusion of Li+, addition of tert-butyl pyridine). In fact, performance was in all cases markedly decreased compared with reference cells fabricated using the Z-907 sensitizer. This is in spite of the fact that the new dye possesses a modestly enhanced absorption coefficient in the red part of the spectrum (albeit with a slightly reduced peak absorption coefficient), and should therefore produce a larger photocurrent compared with Z-907 when used with sufficiently thick TiO2 layers.
Here we attempt to ascertain the reason for the surprisingly poor photovoltaic performance of Z-960. We show that by introducing amino groups onto molecules adsorbed on FTO or nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes, electron transfer to acceptor species in I3−/I− electrolytes becomes more facile, and this is very likely to be the reason for the poor performance of the Z-960 sensitizer. The findings have implications for future sensitizer optimization.
II. Experimental
Synthesis of Ru(4,4′-carboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridine)(4,4′-diamino-2,2′-bipyridine)(NCS)2 (Z-960)
RuCl2(p-cymene)2 (50 mg, mmol) and dabpy (31 mg, mmol) were dissolved in DMF (100 ml). The reaction mixture was heated to 60 °C under nitrogen for 4 h with constant stirring. Subsequently, dcbpy (41 mg, mmol) was added to this reaction flask and the reaction mixture was refluxed at 140 °C for 4 h. Finally, an excess of NH4NCS (mmol) was added to the reaction mixture and the reflux continued for another 4 h. The reaction mixture was cooled down to room temperature and the solvent was removed by using a rotary evaporator under vacuum. Water was added to the flask and the insoluble solid was collected on a sintered glass crucible by suction filtration. The solid was washed with distilled water and diethyl ether, and then dried under vacuum. The crude complex was dissolved in basic methanol (TBAOH) and purified on a Sephadex LH-20 column with methanol as eluent. The collected main band was concentrated and then slowly titrated with an acidic methanol solution (HNO3) to pH 4.1. The precipitate was collected on a sintered glass crucible by suction filtration and dried. 1H NMR (δH/ppm in CD3OD/NaOH): 9.70 (d, 1H), 9.0 (s, 1H), 8.9 (s, 1H), 8.7 (d, 1H), 8.25 (d, 1H), 8.1 (d, 1H), 7.80 (d, 1H), 7.5 (s, 1H), 7.3 (s, 1H), 7.0 (d, 1H), 6.7 (d, 1H), 6.3 (d, 1H).
Fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells
Nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes were fabricated on fluorine-doped tin oxide coated glass substrates (FTO, Pilkington TEC-15) cut into 1.5 cm × 2.5 cm pieces and cleaned by sequential sonication in 5% Decon 90 solution, distilled water, propan-2-ol and absolute ethanol. Complete DSCs were fabricated using substrates either with or without compact TiO2 blocking layers, which were deposited by spray pyrolysis of a 0.2 M solution of titanium(IV)bis(acetoacetonato)di(isopropanoxylate) in ethanol. Spraying was carried out using a hand-held aspirator driven by a vacuum pump with a spraying protocol of 2 sprays every 10 s for 2 min. A 2.8 μm or 12 μm thick translucent layer of nanocrystalline TiO2 was deposited onto the substrate by successive screen printing using a TiO2 paste consisting of Degussa P25 TiO2 powder and an ethyl cellulose binder in α-terpinol. For the 12 μm thick TiO2 electrodes, a 4 μm thick light scattering layer of TiO2 (Dyesol, WER-O) was deposited on top of the translucent layer. The electrodes were then gradually heated to 450 °C where they were held for 15 min before being heated to 500 °C for a further 15 min. Electrodes were then soaked in a 40 mM solution of TiCl4 in distilled water (prepared by dilution of a 2 M stock solution which was prepared at ca. 0 °C) for 30 min at 80 ° C. Electrodes were then rinsed, dried, and heated to ca. 500 °C in a hot air stream for 30 min. Once electrodes had cooled to ca. 100 °C they were immersed into a 0.15 mM solution of either Ru(4,4′-carboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridine)(4,4′-dinonyl-2,2′-bipyridine)(NCS)2 (Z-907, Dyesol) or Ru(4,4′-carboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridine)(4,4′-diamino-2,2′-bipyridine)(NCS)2 (Z-960) in 1∶1 acetonitrile∶tert-butanol and left overnight before being removed and rinsed in acetonitrile. Platinised counter electrodes were fabricated on identical pieces of FTO with small holes drilled into one corner. After cleaning, a thin layer of Pt was deposited onto the FTO by thermal decomposition of hexachloroplatinic acid. Dye-sensitized TiO2 electrodes and counter electrodes were sealed together in a sandwich configuration using a hot-melt polymer (Surlyn, DuPont). The inter-electrode space was filled with an electrolyte by vacuum back-filling. Holes were sealed using a small piece of the hot-melt polymer and a microscope coverslip. Electrolytes were 1 M propylmethylimidazolium iodide (PMII), 0.1 M I2, 0.1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) and 0.5 M N-methylbenzimidazole (NMB) in 3-methoxypropionitrile.
Fabrication of thin-layer cells
Cleaned FTO electrodes were heated to ca. 500 °C for 30 min, allowed to cool to ca. 100 °C and immersed into a 0.15 mM solution of one of the following: Z-907, Z-960, p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) or p-toluic acid (PTA). After soaking overnight, the chemically modified FTO electrodes were rinsed with acetonitrile and used to fabricate thin-layer sandwich cells with Pt counter electrodes, following a similar procedure to that used for fabrication of complete DSCs.
Characterization techniques
IPCE spectra were measured with a spectral resolution of ca. 5 nm using a probe light source consisting of a 300 W Xenon lamp and a grating monochromator equipped with order sorting filters (Newport/Oriel). The incident photon flux was determined using a calibrated silicon photodiode (Newport/Oriel). VOC–intensity characteristics, EIS spectra, and dark current–voltage characteristics were measured using an Autolab potentiostat/galvanostat and the Nova 1.5 software package. EIS experiments using complete DSCs were performed under illumination provided by a red LED (centre wavelength λ = 625 nm) while the cell was biased at the VOC induced by the illumination. Different illumination intensities were achieved using neutral density filters mounted in an automated filter wheel system (Newport), which was controlled by the Nova 1.5 software. The thickness of nanocrystalline TiO2 layers was determined by profilometry measurements using an Alpha-Step IQ surface profiler. Absorbance spectra of bare and dye-sensitized TiO2 layers filled with 3-MPN were measured in direct transmission mode (i.e. not using an integrating sphere) using a Shimadzu SolidSpec-3700 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer. Absorption coefficient spectra for use in simulations were estimated by subtracting the absorbance of bare TiO2 layers from the absorbance of sensitized TiO2 layers.
III. Results and discussion
Photocurrent–voltage and light harvesting characteristics

Fig. 1 shows the current–voltage characteristics of cells employing the Z-960 or Z-907 sensitizers (molecular structures are shown in Fig. 2), with and without compact TiO2 blocking layers. The photovoltaic parameters (VOC, jsc, fill factor, power conversion efficiency) for these cells are given in Table 1. VOC for cells without blocking layers is, in all cases, slightly (ca. 10–20 mV) lower than for cells with blocking layers. This is a first indication that recombination (electron transfer to iodine-like acceptors in the electrolyte) via the exposed FTO substrate influences the photovoltaic characteristics of these cells.

Small, irreproducible differences (ca. 3%, probably within experimental error) in jsc were typically found for cells employing the Z-907 sensitizer, regardless of whether or not the cells were equipped with a blocking layer. For cells employing the Z-960 sensitizer, jsc drops by ca. 14% (1 Sun; Fig. 1a) or ca. 18% (0.1 Sun; Fig. 1b) if cells do not possess a blocking layer. At lower light intensities, for example under laboratory fluorescent light, negligible photovoltage and photocurrent are produced (photocurrent data not shown, but cf.Fig. 3 for photovoltage data). These phenomena indicate that recombination via the substrate is particularly severe when using the Z-960 sensitizer, and leads to significant charge collection losses. Surprisingly, this even occurs under short-circuit conditions where the overpotential for the recombination reaction at the substrate ought to be minimal. However, it is plausible that some recombination losses do arise from substrate recombination because of the non-negligible iR drop across the series resistance of the cells, together with the diffusion overpotential resulting from the passage of photocurrent in the cell. Both effects act to increase the overpotential available for driving the recombination reaction at the substrate under short-circuit conditions.

Also shown are simulations using eqn (3) and parameters from Table 2, using upper estimates for j0 (Z907, short dashed line; Z960, dash-double-dot line). 
 Fig. 5  Semi-logarithmic plots of dark j–V characteristics for complete DSCs employing either Z-960 (a) or Z-907 (b) as sensitizer, with (long dashed lines) and without (solid lines) blocking layers. Simulations based on upper (dash-dot lines) and lower (dash-double-dot lines) j0 estimates in Table 2 are also shown. Data are also presented on a linear current density scale for Z-960 with (long dashed line) or without (solid line) a blocking layer, and for Z-907 with (short dashed line) or without (dash-dot line) a blocking layer. 
The maximum photocurrent produced by cells using the Z-960 sensitizer is only about 56% of that produced when using Z-907 in conjunction with 16 μm thick (12 μm translucent + 4 μm scattering) TiO2 layers, even if a compact TiO2 blocking layer is used. If 2.8 μm thick TiO2 layers are used instead, jsc for Z-960 cells remains lower than for Z-907 cells, but the difference between the cells is smaller than when using thick TiO2 layers: jsc for the Z-960 cell is now 67% of that obtained for the Z-907 cell, as opposed to only 56% found with thicker TiO2 layers.

Fig. 2a shows absorption coefficient spectra (estimated according to the procedure given in the Experimental section) for TiO2 layers sensitized with Z-960 or Z-907. Fig. 2b shows the predicted fraction of incident light absorbed (i.e. light harvesting efficiency; ηlh) by 16 μm and 2.8 μm thick dye-sensitized TiO2 layers, neglecting the effects of light scattering‡ by the TiO2 and other optical losses (i.e. substrate and electrolyte absorption). Based solely upon light harvesting considerations, jsc is predicted to be higher for Z-960 cells compared with Z-907 cells if 16 μm thick TiO2 layers are used (photocurrents of 17 mA cm−2 and 15 mA cm−2, respectively, are predicted by convolution of the ηlh spectra with the AM 1.5 flux spectrum).
For 2.8 μm thick layers, slightly more comparable currents are expected (7.1 mA cm−2 and 6.6 mA cm−2 respectively). The exact opposite is found experimentally; photocurrent from Z-960 cells is always lower than from Z-907 cells, and, importantly, reducing the TiO2 layer thickness results in a relative increase in the current from Z-960 cells compared to Z-907 cells.
Photovoltage–intensity characteristics

Fig. 3 shows photovoltage–intensity characteristics for DSCs employing the two different sensitizers, with or without a compact TiO2 blocking layer. Highly linear semilogarithmic plots are obtained for both sensitizers when a blocking layer is used. The plots for DSCs without blocking layers deviate from linearity; this deviation is particularly large for the Z-960 sensitizer where zero photovoltage is developed at the lowest intensities studied. Since similar plots are obtained for DSCs equipped with blocking layers, regardless of the sensitizer, it is likely that recombination via the FTO substrate for the Z-960 cells is entirely suppressed by application of a blocking layer.7
In an attempt to further quantify the recombination current flowing through the substrate in cells without a blocking layer, data have been fitted using a model similar to the one proposed by Cameron et al.,7 which describes the VOC–I0 characteristics of DSCs. We first assume that for steady-state, open-circuit conditions the photogeneration flux must balance the recombination fluxes from the porous TiO2 layer and from the exposed substrate G = I0ηlhηsep = JTiO2 + Jsub(1)where G is the photogeneration flux, I0 is the incident photon flux, ηlh is the light harvesting efficiency, ηsep is the charge separation efficiency, JTiO2 is the recombination flux flowing through the sensitized TiO2 layer, and Jsub is the recombination flux flowing through the substrate. For a free electron concentration in the TiO2, nc, which is much greater than the dark equilibrium electron concentration, neqm, the TiO2 recombination flux can be approximated by (2)where d is the TiO2 layer thickness, kn is the rate constant for recombination of conduction band electrons with the oxidized form of the redox couple, nc is the TiO2 conduction band electron concentration, γn is an empirically determined reaction order and neqm is the concentration of conduction band electrons at thermal equilibrium in the dark. The dependence of the substrate recombination flux on VOC (i.e. overpotential) can be approximated by the Butler–Volmer equation (3)where α is the transfer coefficient, n is the number of electrons transferred and j0 is the exchange current density. From eqn (1)–(3) the following expression describing VOC–I0 characteristics can be derived (4)where (5) (6)VOC–I0 data have been fitted using eqn (4) with B = 0 for cells with blocking layers to obtain the A and γn values relevant to each sensitizer. These parameters are then assumed to be the same for the cells without blocking layers (since nominally identical TiO2 layers and electrolytes are used), allowing B and α (assuming n = 1) to be determined.
The recombination flux flowing through the substrate in cells using the two different sensitizers can be compared based upon the fitting results. Assuming that the parameters A and γn are unaffected by adding a blocking layer to the DSC (a reasonable assumption), it is possible to determine j0 from the constant B if the relationship between G and I0 is known (i.e. if ηlhηsep is known). The maximum possible value for the product ηlhηsep is 1, so that the highest possible value of j0 is qB. The minimum value of ηlhηsep can be estimated from the IPCE of these cells at the wavelength used for the VOC–I0 measurement: assuming a collection efficiency of unity and intensity-independent ηlh and ηsep, an absolute lower limit for j0 is given by IPCE × qB.
Using this approach the substrate exchange current density is found to be in the range 5.3 × 10−7–4.0 × 10−6 A cm−2 for the Z-960 sensitizer and 8.1 × 10−9–1.7 × 10−8 A cm−2 for the Z-907 sensitizer. The estimates of j0 from these VOC–I0 data show quantitatively that recombination through the substrate is greatly enhanced with the Z-960 sensitizer, compared to the Z-907 sensitizer.
Current–voltage characteristics of chemically modified FTO electrodes
An interesting question is whether the enhanced substrate recombination found when using Z-960 arises from a poor ability to shield the substrate from electron acceptors compared with Z-907, or whether Z-960 actively catalyses recombination, as suggested by O'Regan et al. for the case of sensitizers incorporating ligands bearing potential I2 binding sites.8

Fig. 4 shows j–V characteristics for thin-layer cells, without sensitized TiO2 layers, using bare FTO and FTO modified with a monolayer of either Z-960 or Z-907. Voltage sweeps were performed in the dark at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 and the voltage scale is uncorrected for ohmic drop across the FTO layer (which is negligible in these cells for currents less than ca. 0.1 mA). The overpotential for the reduction of I3− and the oxidation of I− on the Pt-coated electrode in these cells is very low, and the diffusion limited current has been determined to be >10−2 A cm−2, therefore, the plots in Fig. 4 essentially show the dependence of current density on overpotential at the FTO electrode.
It is clear that modification of FTO with Z-960 leads to a modest increase in cathodic current density (corresponding to the substrate recombination current in complete DSCs) compared with unmodified FTO. In stark contrast to Z-960, Z-907 is found to significantly reduce the cathodic current density at all voltages. Interestingly, modification of the FTO with Z-960 or Z-907 also alters the “Tafel slopes” of the plots. The slope for Z-960-modified FTO is slightly shallower than for bare FTO, whereas Z-907 results in a much steeper slope than either Z-960-modified FTO or bare FTO. These changes in slope are qualitatively consistent with the transfer coefficient (α) values obtained by fitting VOC–I0 data. For direct comparison with the results obtained by fitting VOC–I0 data, the j–V characteristics predicted from the fitting parameters given in Table 2 are also plotted in Fig. 4. The slopes of the simulated plots are in reasonable agreement with experiment, but the magnitude of the exchange current density is 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than that found experimentally.
Some disagreement must be expected between these results since the simulated curves only predict the current density flowing through the part of the FTO substrate exposed to the electrolyte. In complete cells, the substrate must be partially blocked by the porous TiO2 layer, and probably further by the TiCl4 post-treatment. Only considering the porosity of the TiO2 (i.e. estimating that 50% of the substrate is blocked by TiO2), it is not possible to explain such a large difference in exchange current density. However, the influence of the TiCl4 post-treatment could plausibly produce such an effect.

Fig. 5 shows the dark j–V characteristics of complete DSCs employing the two sensitizers, with or without a blocking layer. The j–V plots almost coincide at high negative bias voltages for cells with and without blocking layers, making the voltage regime where current predominantly flows through the substrate clear by comparison between cells with and without blocking layers.
Simulated j–V curves based on parameters obtained from fitting VOC–I0 data (for cells without blocking layers) are also shown in Fig. 5. Both the magnitude and slope of the simulated plots are in very good agreement with the experimental data for the Z-960 cell; the bias voltage where recombination from the porous TiO2 begins to dominate over substrate recombination is, within estimated uncertainties, correctly predicted by the intersection of the simulated and experimental curves. It is worth noting at this point that the assumption of ηcol = 1 for the Z-960 cell is almost certainly incorrect (vide infra), therefore, the lower simulated line in Fig. 5a is likely to substantially underestimate the substrate current density, thus adding more significance to the good agreement between the simulated and measured plots.
Simulated plots are not so satisfactory for the Z-907 sensitizer, although the magnitude of the substrate current densities predicted from the VOC–I0 fits is in much closer agreement with experiment, compared with the results obtained for FTO thin layer cells (cf. Fig. 4). These findings confirm the hypothesis that covering the FTO with the porous TiO2 layer, and probably material from the TiCl4 post-treatment, can reduce substrate recombination currents by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude.

Fig. 5c shows the same data from Fig. 5a and b with a linear current density scale. In these plots, electrocatalytic I− oxidation by the oxidized sensitizer can be clearly observed at positive bias voltages for cells without blocking layers.9,10 Addition of a TiO2 blocking layer greatly suppresses this current (although it can still be identified on a logarithmic current density scale), presumably because at these potentials the depletion region in the blocking layer is too wide to allow electron exchange between the substrate and adsorbed sensitizer molecules. The difference in the onset potential for catalytic iodide oxidation (ca. 0.15 V) probably arises because of the energy difference between the HOMO levels of the two sensitizers (ESI†), and thus indicates that the energy levels of the Z-960 sensitizer lie at more negative potentials than those of Z-907, as intended by design.
Analysis of charge transport and recombination by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
Despite the large difference in substrate recombination rates between cells using the Z-907 and Z-960 sensitizers, the recombination current flowing through an unblocked substrate for the Z-960 sensitizer in a complete cell at open-circuit under 1 Sun illumination is still much smaller (ca. 10−4 A cm−2) than the short-circuit photocurrent (ca. 10−2 A cm−2). Therefore, recombination via the substrate cannot be the main explanation for the poor performance of the Z-960 sensitizer relative to Z-907 under realistic working conditions.
The most likely remaining possibilities for the poor performance of Z-960 relative to Z-907 are that either electron injection or charge collection is less efficient in Z-960 cells. The possibility of an inferior electron injection yield for Z-960 compared to Z-907 seems unlikely as the excited states of Z-960 are expected to lie at higher energies than to those of Z-907, due to the substitution of nonyl groups with electron donating amino groups.
The energy of the TiO2 conduction band edge relative to the electrolyte redox level is also estimated to be the same for cells employing the two different sensitizers (vide infra). In partial support of the assumption regarding the excited state energy levels, the HOMO level of Z-960 is ca. 0.13 V more negative than the HOMO of Z-907 (ESI†). Assuming a similar E0–0 transition energy (this assumption is partially supported by the absorption coefficient spectra, cf.Fig 2a), this implies higher lying excited states.

Fig. 6 shows the dependencies of transport resistance (Rt), charge transfer resistance (Rct), TiO2 chemical capacitance (Cμ) and electron diffusion length (Ln) on Vcorr (VOC or Vbias corrected for iR drop across the total series resistance) for bare TiO2 cells, and for DSCs employing the Z-960 and Z-907 sensitizers.11,12 Relatively thin, 2.8 μm thick TiO2 layers were chosen for these measurements in order to avoid uncertainties in fitting EIS data when Ln is very short relative to the layer thickness, as was found for cells using the Z-960 sensitizer.13 Essentially identical conclusions to those which follow can be drawn from fitting results obtained for thicker 16 μm TiO2 layers (ESI†).
 Fig. 6  Dependence of charge transport resistance (Rt, a), chemical capacitance (Cμ, b), charge transfer resistance (Rct) for measurements under illumination (c) and in the dark (d), and electron diffusion length (Ln, e) on cell voltage (VOC or Vbias corrected for iR drop across the total series resistance) for DSCs employing Z-960 and Z-907 sensitizers. In all plots open triangles represent bare TiO2, filled circles or squares represent Z-960, and open circles or squares represent Z-907. Squares represent measurements performed under illumination (at close-to-open circuit conditions), and circles represent measurements made in the dark. Measurements for bare TiO2 (open triangles) were only made in the dark. 
Plots of Cμversus Vint coincide for all cells at each measurement condition, although there is a small shift (up to ca. 50 mV) towards more negative voltages for data obtained with cells under illumination. This may either arise because of the instability of the cells (EIS measurements in the dark and under illumination are necessarily made one after the other, not simultaneously), or it may be a real effect resulting from illumination. Determining the cause for this shift is outside the scope of the present work and for the remainder of the discussion, data obtained for cells under illumination will be treated separately from data obtained for cells in the dark.
The same coincidence between plots is also found for Rt–Vcell measurements made under illumination and, for sufficiently large values of Rt, also in the dark. The curvature of the plots for low values of Rt is probably because fitting becomes unreliable when the transport impedance becomes comparable to the cathode impedance.14 At sufficiently high values of Rt, plots tend towards an “ideal” slope of 17 V−1.12
The fact that Rt–Vint and Cμ–Vint plots are nearly identical for both sensitizers suggests that the energy difference between the TiO2 conduction band edge and the electrolyte redox level is practically the same in each case. This implies that the electron injection efficiency for Z-960 should be at least as high as for Z-907, provided its excited state levels lie at similar or higher energy than those of Z-907, as discussed previously.
The identical conduction band edge positions for these cells permits direct comparison of Rct between the two sensitizers at a constant cell voltage. The Rct for the cell with the Z-960 sensitizer is ca. 5 times lower than for the cell with the Z-907 sensitizer at any given VOC for measurements made under illumination, which is qualitatively consistent with the lower VOC under 1 Sun illumination.
In the absence of background illumination, the Rct for Z-907 varies between being 2–5 times greater than for Z-960, with the largest difference found at lower cell voltages. Since in the dark there are no oxidized sensitizer molecules, this result suggests that the main reason for enhanced recombination when using Z-960 is not related to a lower sensitizer regeneration yield. However, the differences between EIS data obtained in the dark and under illumination still demand an explanation, and some contribution to the overall recombination flux under illumination from electron transfer to oxidized sensitizer molecules cannot be ruled out entirely.
The Rct measured in the dark for the Z-960 cell is very similar to that of bare TiO2 at any given voltage. This could be viewed as evidence that the reason for the enhanced recombination with Z-960 compared with Z-907 is simply due to it being a poorer shielder of electron acceptors, rather than it actively catalysing recombination. However, this cannot explain the slightly enhanced current densities observed at FTO modified with Z-960 relative to bare FTO. It is also noteworthy that the sensitizers known as N3 or N719, which do not possess long alkyl chains, are used to fabricate the most efficient DSCs known. Since Z-960 is structurally very similar to these dyes, it seems, from a purely steric point of view, very unlikely that Z-960 would be any worse at shielding the TiO2 from electron acceptors.
The low Rct values for Z-960 cells also result in an Ln, which, at all voltages studied, is much shorter than the 16 μm TiO2 layers which were used for the 1 Sun j–V measurements. Surprisingly, we find that Ln values for Z-907 cells derived from fitting EIS data, while still being much longer than the 2.8 μm thick TiO2 layers used in these experiments, are shorter than we typically find for thicker (12–16 μm) TiO2 layers.15,16 Results for the Z-960 sensitizer with thick TiO2 layers are, however, consistent with Ln values much less than the TiO2 layer thickness. These data raise the possibility that Ln derived from EIS adopts an unexpected layer thickness dependence, which will be the subject of future investigation in our laboratory.
Such a short Ln for the Z-960 cells means that very significant charge collection losses are predicted for 16 μm thick TiO2 layers, which is qualitatively consistent with the lower-than-expected jsc at 1 Sun. To test this predication more quantitatively, we have simulated IPCE spectra for a cell employing the Z-960 sensitizer, using a well-known model based upon the electron continuity equation.16–19 Inputs to the model are the estimated absorption coefficient data for the dye-sensitized TiO2 layer (Fig. 2a) and the electrolyte, the substrate transmission spectrum, and Ln, which for the purposes of this simulation is assumed to be 6 μm (estimate based on Fig. 6e).

Fig. 7 shows the IPCE spectrum predicted according to the approach outlined above, together with the experimentally determined IPCE spectrum (measured without background illumination), and a simulation assuming 100% efficient charge collection. For the purposes of this simulation, it is assumed that electron injection is 100% efficient.
 Fig. 7  Simulated (long dashed and short dashed lines) and experimental (solid lines) IPCE spectra for a DSC employing the Z-960 sensitizer and a 16 μm thick TiO2 layer. 
Even taking Ln = 6 μm (only slightly more than a third of the TiO2 layer thickness), the IPCE is still overestimated by the simulation. This may be partly due to an electron injection efficiency that is less than unity as assumed in the simulation. However, the simulation result clearly shows that collection losses, which are of the order of those predicted by EIS measurements, can explain a large fraction of the decrease in IPCE relative to the 100% collection case. It is therefore very likely that collection losses are a significant factor contributing to the lower-than-expected photocurrent obtained under 1 Sun illumination.
Influence of amino groups on interfacial charge transfer kinetics
It has now been demonstrated that the Z-960 sensitizer modestly catalyzes recombination via the FTO substrate, while Z-907 acts to reduce it. It has also been shown that recombination via the porous TiO2 layer is faster in cells using Z-960 compared with Z-907. As already mentioned, O'Regan et al. have recently presented compelling evidence that certain dye molecules catalyse recombination, and that the extent of catalysis is related to the ability of the dye molecules to bind I2.8 It is well known that the lone pair on the N atom in amines or anilines can bind I2, forming a charge transfer complex.20–22 Therefore, it is plausible that the increased recombination observed when using Z-960 may be caused by the sensitizer's ability to bind I2.
To test the hypothesis that introducing an amino group to a surface-bound molecule can increase the rate of interfacial charge transfer, we have examined the j–V characteristics and EIS spectra of thin-layer cells using FTO and TiO2 electrodes with various surface modifications. Fig. 8 shows j–V characteristics for FTO–Pt thin-layer cells fabricated using FTO electrodes modified with either p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) or p-toluic acid (PTA); the structures of these molecules are shown in Fig. 8b. The difference between PABA and PTA is that PABA bears an amino group in the 4 position of the benzene ring, whereas PTA bears a methyl group; the I2 binding constant for PTA is therefore expected to be lower than for PABA. It should be noted that, even though PTA does not bear an amino group, the benzene ring is likely to act as a weak π-donor in this case. Nevertheless, a lower iodine-binding constant compared with PABA is still expected. By comparing data obtained for bare and chemically modified FTO, electron transfer catalysis and surface passivation effects ought to be distinguishable. Fig. 8a shows that modification of FTO with PABA leads to an even greater increase in current density compared to bare FTO than found for Z-960 surface modification. Interestingly, both the cathodic and anodic currents increase, implying that the surface adsorbed molecule also assists in iodide oxidation. PTA reduces currents relative to bare FTO, which is consistent with it partially blocking the FTO surface, without simultaneously introducing I2 binding sites stronger than those that may already be present on bare FTO.

Fig. 9 shows plots of Rctversus Cμ for nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes modified with PABA or PTA. Bisquert has shown that Cμ basically provides a measure of the TiO2 density of states at the quasi-Fermi level (QFL), and Rct, which is determined simultaneously with Cμ, is the differential resistance to charge transfer at the same QFL position. Provided that TiO2 layers with the same density of states are compared, as in the present case, changes in Rct at a constant Cμ can be associated with changes in the charge transfer rate constant at the same QFL position. Alternatively, plots of Rctvs. 1/Rt (proportional to the TiO2 conductivity and carrier density) could be constructed, however, as mentioned previously, fitting Rt when it is small compared to the cathode impedance is less reliable than fitting Cμ, thus Cμ was chosen as the indicator of QFL position in the present case.
 Fig. 9  Charge transfer resistance as a function of TiO2 chemical capacitance for bare TiO2 (triangles), PTA-modified TiO2 (squares) and PABA-modified TiO2 (circles). Light and dark shades represent different samples. 
The approach outlined above avoids errors in interpretation arising from conduction band shifts between cells, caused by adsorption of molecules with different dipole moments; it is somewhat analogous to the approach of comparing lifetimes or dark current at a constant charge density, and these plots can in fact be constructed by appropriate integration of the EIS data.
It is clear from Fig. 9 that PTA modification of the TiO2 surface modestly, but reproducibly, increases Rct. The extra data points and a wider Cμ range for the PTA cells are in fact a consequence of this, for the other cells Rct could not be unambiguously determined over such a wide range because of a short Ln resulting in EIS spectra resembling a Gerischer impedance, which cannot be fitted reliably.
As already suggested for the FTO thin-layer cells, it is likely that the higher Rct for PTA-modified TiO2 cells is caused by blocking the surface without specifically catalysing interfacial charge transfer. On the other hand, PABA reduces Rct by up to a factor of 2 compared with bare TiO2, or as much as a factor of 4 compared with PTA modified TiO2. We feel that the latter comparison is more useful in gauging the impact of the amino group on Rct since, given the nearly identical structure of PTA and PABA, the influence of blocking potential charge transfer sites on the TiO2 surface is adequately accounted for.
We should note here that O'Regan et al. have also investigated the influence of PABA on the characteristics of complete DSCs.23 Consistent with the results presented here, they found that adding PABA to the electrolyte of complete DSCs increases the recombination flux compared with no additive, or a different additive that has a lower I2 binding constant.
IV. Conclusions
Replacement of the nonyl groups on the Z-907 sensitizer with amino groups results in a dramatic enhancement of recombination from both the TiO2 layer and the substrate if left exposed to the electrolyte. This enhanced recombination rate leads to poor photovoltaic performance, mainly as a result of a short electron diffusion length which leads to substantial photocurrent losses. Loss in open-circuit photovoltage, which is also caused by faster charge recombination, is another important factor.
The difference in charge transfer resistance between Z-960- and Z-907-based DSCs increases slightly when measurements are made under illumination, possibly due to light-induced changes in the concentrations of electron acceptor species (triiodide/iodine and/or oxidized sensitizer molecules). However, even in dark measurements, charge transfer is on average 3 times faster in the Z-960 cells compared with Z-907 cells, allowing us to rule out more recombination with oxidized sensitizer molecules as being the predominant cause for the poor performance of Z-960.
Experiments using bare and chemically modified FTO show that Z-960 actually acts to modestly catalyze I3−/I2 reduction, in contrast to Z-907 which significantly inhibits this reaction. More dramatic results were obtained using simpler benzoic acids with either amino or alkyl functionalities, implying that the amine group is the cause for the catalysis of I3−/I2 reduction. These results go some way towards confirming the earlier suggestions of O'Regan et al. regarding the role of iodine binding in the catalysis of recombination.
We should note at this point that various nitrogen-containing heterocycles, such as tert-butyl pyridine (TBP) or N-methylbenzimidazole (NMB), are often used as electrolyte additives to increase the performance of DSCs. This may seem to contradict our results prima facie. However, we believe that the mode of action of common nitrogen-containing electrolyte additives is very different to that of amino-bearing molecules which are chemisorbed to the TiO2 through a dedicated anchoring group, such as a carboxylate group. The mechanisms by which TBP (and probably NMB) increases the performance of DSCs can be summarised as follows.24–26 Firstly, the additive deprotonates the TiO2 surface and probably also binds to the surface through an interaction of the lone pair on the nitrogen group with acceptor sites on the TiO2. The associated change in surface dipole shifts the conduction band of the TiO2 to more negative potentials, thus increasing photovoltage. Secondly, the binding of the additive to the surface physically shields the electrode from electron acceptors, or deactivates recombination centres, again increasing performance.
All of the above modes of action do not result in the additive molecule being bound to the surface in a way where the lone pair on the nitrogen is available to bind iodine, or iodine-like electrolyte species. Therefore, it would seem that our results do not contradict the commonly observed performance increase when adding nitrogen-containing bases to the electrolyte of DSCs.
Our findings also highlight the need to consider the interaction of the sensitizer molecule with acceptor species in the electrolyte when designing new sensitizers. With this in mind, it would be interesting to test Z-960, and possibly other “failed” solar cell dyes, with alternative redox mediators where the oxidised species may have a weaker interaction with the sensitizer. One such class of mediators are cobalt II/III complexes,27,28 which are still capable of regenerating ruthenium sensitizers efficiently, but would not necessarily be expected to have any specific binding interaction with common sensitizers.
