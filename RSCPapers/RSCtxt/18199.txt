    , Accepted 11th December 2013First published on 13th December 2013AbstractWe report on the first synthesis of a highly crystalline donor–acceptor low band gap block copolymer by using diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as a low band gap block and perylenebisimide (PDI) as a strong acceptor block. All important prerequisites for PV applications such as strong and broad optical absorption, compatible HOMO–LUMO levels can be accomplished and combined on one macromolecule at the same time. Besides, microphase separation is achieved by solvent annealing the film in dichloromethane and the PV performance is improved from 0.25% to 0.89%. The morphology and performance of this single component system can be enhanced by further improvements under processing conditions.
Introduction
The discovery of conducting polymers has promoted a global effort in commercialization of organic semiconductors that offer unique advantages over traditional systems as a result of their light weight, low cost, multi-optional synthetic strategies, solution processability, and ease of fabrication.1–3 The design and development of new polymeric materials as active components in organic solar cells and organic light emitting diodes have increased the motivation of academia and industry to substitute inorganic materials with the organic ones in optoelectronic systems. In organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, the essential parameters such as control of morphology and π conjugation can be determined by tuning processing conditions for efficient device performance.4–9 Proper film-formation must be combined with a suitable chemical structure to fulfill the requirements of light absorption, charge separation, and charge transport in confined geometries.10,11 The ability to control the self-assembly of nano-structured materials is key in developing optimized devices. Morphological control at the nanoscale is required to enhance the interaction between the components and to ensure long-term device stability. Block copolymers present one strategy to meet these requirements, since they microphase separate into nanoscopic spherical, cylindrical, gyroid, or lamellar morphologies,12 opening the possibility of controlling the type, size, and orientation of the domains. Thelakkat and co-workers13 studied diblock copolymers containing a poly(4-vinyl triphenylamine) (electron donor) block and a perylenebisimide acrylate (electron acceptor) block. The reported maximum power conversion efficiencies in devices constructed from these diblock copolymers were only 0.35%. Thelakkat et al. and Russell et al. investigated the size effects in OPV materials from molecular scale through mesoscopic to macroscopic scale using the principles of self-assembly of block copolymers.14–16 In both studies, a polymerizable perylenebisimide derivative (acceptor) was packed into crystalline microdomains in a polythiophene matrix (donor), as a result of strong π–π stacking between adjacent perylenebisimide moieties.14,15 Despite achieving microphase separation, power conversion efficiencies of the devices constructed from these copolymers were only 0.49%.15
For almost two decades, research on intrinsically conductive organic materials has demonstrated that the efficient power conversion relies on the control of the band gap of extended π-conjugated systems.17–20 Active materials for electronic and photonic applications must present appropriate absorption and/or emission properties, since highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO and LUMO) energy levels have a strong effect on charge-transport properties. Other key attributes of the hole-conducting polymer essentially for optimal performance include a broader absorption of light, a relatively low HOMO level, and a higher hole mobility. There are three useful strategies to satisfy these requirements: (i) a low band gap approach via donor–acceptor combination for a narrower Eg and a deeper LUMO level, (ii) addition of electron-withdrawing groups to depress the HOMO level, and (iii) maintaining two-dimensional conjugation for broad absorption and higher hole mobility.21,22 Better planarity of the main chain and reduction in the steric hindrance of side chains can be considered for a stronger π–π stacking and increased hole mobility.23 Furthermore, the molecular weight of the polymers also influences the OPV performance, emerging an optimal molecular weight in most cases.24 To produce high efficiency OPV devices, researchers should attempt to increase the molecular weight while maintaining a better solubility. Recently, ∼10% efficiency has been obtained by using these approaches.25–32
Herein, we report the synthesis of a highly crystalline donor–acceptor low band gap copolymer consisting of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as the donor and perylenebisimide (PDI) as the acceptor component. In order to obtain the desired donor–acceptor low band gap polymers with broad absorption, a DPP based macroinitator (absorbance in blue and red regimes) was linked to electron accepting PDI molecules (absorbance in green regime). Such a material offers a strong and broad optical absorption of the visible spectrum, compatible HOMO–LUMO levels, and crystallinity driven phase separation. As a result, we have achieved 0.89% efficiency, which is one of the highest efficiency reported for single component solar cells.33–35
Results and discussion
The DPP based macroinitator was prepared in seven steps and the PDI based acrylic monomer in four steps. The DPP based macroinitator was used for polymerization of the acryloyl based perylenebisimide monomer (see ESI†). 1H-NMR data were used for the characterization of all molecules. The degree of polymerization (DP) was calculated in reference to the perylenebisimide block protons and selected DPP protons using 1H-NMR of the block copolymer (Fig. S5†) and found to be 3–4. On the other hand, according to GPC data, Mw and PDI were found to be 7200 g mol−1 and 1.16, respectively, using a polystyrene standard (Fig. S6†). The molecular weight measured by GPC is higher than that calculated from 1H-NMR, due to the rigid nature of the DPP–PDI block copolymer (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Structure of the DPP–PDI block copolymer. 
Optical and electrochemical characterization of DPP–PDI block copolymers was carried out via UV-Vis absorption, photoluminescence (PL) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The HOMO–LUMO band gaps were calculated using the same techniques. The UV-Vis spectrum of the PDI-acceptor moiety in DCM solutions exhibits three characteristic absorption bands at λmax = 459, 488 and 522 nm.36 The DPP based macroinitator has two major absorption bands at λmax ∼375 and ∼590 nm (ref. 37) which are attributed to the π–π* and intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT) bands, respectively (Fig. S7†). These bands in the copolymer do not show a dramatic shift in structure and in their intensity. A red shift was observed in the thin film due to the π–π interaction in the solid state (Fig. S8†). Overall, the optical analyses show that the DPP-macroinitator and PDI-acceptor have complementary absorption properties in the visible and near IR regimes. Owing to this property, a black polymer with broad absorption characteristics has been obtained (Fig. 2).

The photoluminescence PL behavior was characterized under similar conditions (0.02 mg mL−1 in DCM and/or in thin films). Fig. 3 shows a comparison of the PL spectra of the monomer, macroinitator and DPP–PDI block copolymer. The PDI-monomer exhibits strong emission bands at λmax = 536, 562 and 625 nm (λex = 488 nm).36 The excitation of the DPP-macroinitator at its absorption maxima (λex = 380 nm) resulted in three distinct emission bands at 412, 445 and 775 nm. A large decrease in PL occurs upon polymerization of the macromonomer in which the DPP-macroinitator is covalently linked to the perylene-acceptor (λex = 355 nm) (Fig. S9†). The strong PL observed in thin films of the monomer and the macroinitiator was not seen in the thin films of the copolymer. Quenched PL in the copolymer can be explained by photo-induced electron transfer from DPP (the low band gap block) to PDI (the acceptor block) at the excited state (Fig. 3).

HOMO and LUMO energy levels and band gaps, Eg, of the DPP–PDI block copolymer can be calculated by using CV. In the cathodic scan regime, the PDI-monomer exhibits characteristic reversible reduction from −0.40 to −0.46 V (Ered1PDI,1/2 = −0.43 V), and −0.56 to −0.62 V (Ered2PDI,1/2 = −0.59 V) which reflects the first and the second one-electron stepwise reduction process of perylenebisimides. Furthermore, a reversible reduction of DPP was observed with a half wave potential at Ered1DPP,1/2 = −1.06 V. In the anodic regime, DPP showed two reversible oxidation peaks at 0.62–0.78 V (Eox1DPP,1/2 = 0.70 V) and 1.12–1.36 V (Eox2DPP,1/2 = 1.24 V) (Fig. 4). Finally, in the CV of the DPP–PDI block copolymer, both the DPP oxidation–reduction and PDI reduction were clearly observed. These results indicate that there is no interaction between the DPP based low band gap macroinitator and the PDI-acceptor in the neutral state.
 Fig. 4  CV curves of initial compounds and the DPP–PDI block copolymer, E°(Fc/Fc+) = +0.41 V (vs. Ag wire). 
Optical and electrochemical band gap results are summarized in Table 1. The band gap values are not identical, since significant fluorescence quenching was observed in the copolymer, although the PDI monomer and DPP-macroinitator showed their distinct photoluminescence peaks. These results show that possible photo-induced electron transfer occurs from DPP as the low band gap block to PDI as the acceptor block in the excited state. Therefore, this new material holds promise as a good candidate for an efficient OPV device.

The thermal properties of the DPP–PDI copolymers were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Fig. 5). The solvent treated, desiccated raw material was initially heated above the melting temperature of the component blocks. The DSC trace of DPP–PDI has two peaks at 96.0 and 109.5 °C, corresponding to the melting temperatures of the blocks, respectively.14 This reflects the easy crystallization of the blocks in solution. A single exotherm at 54.7 °C was observed when the block copolymer was slowly cooled from the melt, suggesting a co-crystallization of DPP and PDI from the melt which limits the segregation of the components.
 Fig. 5  DSC curve of the DPP–PDI block copolymer. 
Solvent processing of DPP–PDI potentially leads to large grain sizes and high crystallinity. To maximize the device efficiency, processing conditions need to be identified in order to control the size of the crystals. Films of the copolymer were prepared by spin coating from chloroform (CF) and chlorobenzene (CB). The topography and phase contrast can be attributed to the crystalline domains of the PDI and DPP blocks (Fig. S10 and S11†). By thermal annealing at the melting point of each block (100 °C), the size of crystalline domains increases and grain growth proceeds without changing the orientation of the grains. However, this does not increase the charge separation between DPP and PDI phases. Lower device efficiency was found upon thermal annealing carried out in accordance with the DSC results.
To understand the role of morphology, photovoltaic devices based on the DPP–PDI copolymers were fabricated with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/DPP–PDI (from 70 to 120 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm). The device performance was measured under ambient conditions with an AM 1.5 solar simulator at 100 mW cm−2. The device obtained by CB spin coating showed a better performance, considering AFM and TEM results where a finer crystalline texture was observed. The film thickness also played an important role in defining the morphology. The thinner films achieved by varying the spin speed or solution concentration yielded a finer crystalline texture. There was only a weak phase contrast evident by AFM. However, the small refinement in the crystal texture (Fig. 6a) enhanced the PV performance from 0.25% to 0.47%. By solvent annealing the film in DCM, further microphase separation was achieved (Fig. 6b), and the PV performance was improved from 0.47% to 0.89% (Fig. 7).

On the other hand, the incident monochromatic photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured at 600 nm leading to 45% of current (Fig. 8). A remarkable broad photocurrent response is obtained because of the complementary absorbance properties of DPP and PDI.

Conclusion
In summary, a novel block copolymer was synthesized based on a diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) low band gap macroinitator and a perylenebisimide acceptor. Optical and electrochemical results show that the HOMO–LUMO levels and broad absorption properties of the DPP–PDI block copolymer are advantageous for photovoltaic device applications. The new copolymer also exhibits a broad absorption in the visible and near IR regimes. Two exothermic peaks observed in DSCs are strong indicators of high crystallinity and phase separation. Larger crystalline domains resulted upon thermal annealing did not improve the charge separation between the components and thus displayed a lower performance. Finer crystal textures were achieved by reducing the film thickness, i.e. changing the processing conditions increased the efficiency from 0.25% to 0.89%. Further improvements in the processing conditions can clearly offer better morphology and therefore enhance the performance of this single component system.
Experimental section
All synthetic steps are given in the ESI.†1H NMR (Bruker Avance DPX-400) spectra were recorded at 25 °C in deuterated chloroform (CHCl3-d) and TMS as an internal standard. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was performed in THF relative to polystyrene standards (Scientific Polymer Products) on a system equipped with a three-column set (Polymer Laboratories 300 × 7.5 mm; 5 μm; pore sizes, 10−5, 10−4, and 10−3 Å) and a refractive-index detector (HP 1047 A) at room temperature with a flow rate of 1 mL min−1. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique used for electrochemical measurements was performed using the BASi EC epsilon potentiostat–galvanostat system. The electrochemical cell includes an Ag wire as the reference electrode (RE), Pt wire as the counter electrode (CE) and platinum disk (0.02 cm2) as the working electrode (WE) immersed in 0.1 M TBAPF6/DCM as the supporting electrolyte. CV measurements were carried out under an argon atmosphere. HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymer were calculated according to the inner reference ferrocene redox couple E°(Fc/Fc+) = +0.41 V (vs. Ag wire) in DCM by using the formulae EHOMO = −e(Eox − EFc) + (−4.8 eV) and ELUMO = −e(Ered − EFc) + (−4.8 eV).38 The electrochemical HOMO–LUMO energy levels were calculated from their oxidation and reduction onset values. UV-Vis spectra were recorded by using a Shimatszu UV3600 spectrophotometer. The absorption spectra of the monomer and polymer were recorded in DCM solution and/or on the transparent glass surface. The optical band gap (Eg) of products was calculated from their solid state low energy absorption edges (Eg = 1241/λonset).18 Photoluminescence spectra were recorded on a PTIQM30 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) images were obtained in both the height and phase-contrast mode using a Digital Instruments Dimension 3000 scanning force microscope in the tapping mode. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using a JEOL 2000CX instrument at 200 kV accelerating voltage. DSC measurements were performed on a TA Q100 thermal analyzer at a scanning rate of 10 °C min−1.
Photovoltaic devices were fabricated on indium tin oxide (ITO) covered glass substrates with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/DPP–PDI (from 70 to 120 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm). First, ITO electrodes were cleaned with detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol and then oven-dried at 100 °C for 5 h (please double check the drying time), and finally treated with oxygen plasma. Device production and current/voltage property measurements were conducted in a nitrogen filled glove box system (MBraun) (moisture < 0.1 ppm; oxygen < 0.1 ppm). An approximately 40 nm thick layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was spin-coated from aqueous solution (Baytron PH500, HC Stack Inc.). The substrate was dried for 10 min at 150 °C. On top of the PEDOT:PSS, the active layer (from 70 to 120 nm) was spin-coated from chlorobenzene (CB) or chloroform solution (from ∼1 wt% to ∼2 wt%) of the DPP–PDI block copolymer. The top electrode consists of a 1 nm thick layer of lithium fluoride (LiF) followed by a 60 nm thick layer of aluminum (Al) deposited by thermal evaporation under ∼2 × 10−6 mbar vacuum. Layer thicknesses were measured by using an Ambios Tech XP-1 High Resolution profilometer. The active area of each cell was 6 mm2. Thermal annealing was carried out by directly placing the completed devices on a digitally controlled hot plate at various temperatures, inside the glove box filled with nitrogen gas. After annealing, the devices were placed on a metal plate and cooled to room temperature prior to conducting measurements. All current voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under AM 1.5G-filtered irradiation (100 mW cm−2) from a 1 kW Oriel solar simulator. The light intensity was measured with an Oriel radiant power meter.
