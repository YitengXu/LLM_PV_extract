Planar 2D anisotropy and interlayer van der Waals gaps are the important characteristics of these nanocrystals for pristine disc, plate or sheet morphologies. These 2D nanocrystals undergo unique chemical transformations upon exposure to external chemical stimuli and newly obtained structures are 2D nanostructures with high complexity in their morphological geometries and chemical compositions.

1. Introduction
Dimensionality is one of the defining parameters in nanoscience; the same chemical compound can exhibit drastically different properties depending on whether it is arranged in a 0D, 1D, 2D, or 3D structure.1–3 Although quasi-0D (e.g. cage molecules), quasi-1D (e.g. nanotubes), and, of course, 3D crystalline objects are well studied, dimensionality two has not drawn much interest until recently.1 Hereof, nanoscale layered structure materials, which naturally occur in 2D, are emerging fast with new discoveries on their unique optical,2,4 electronic,5,6 catalytic7 and mechanical properties.8 Among a number of important 2D layered materials, besides much attention to graphene, focus is now directed to metal chalcogenide nanostructures in that a broad range of metals and oxidation states are included in this structural class. Unique characteristics arising from compositional and structural variety enable tuning of the physicochemical properties of metal chalcogenides, for instance, from metallic to semimetallic or semiconducting electronic band structures.9,10 The important structural characteristics of layered metal chalcogenides are depicted in Scheme 1. Within each layer, atoms are covalently bonded (e.g. X–M–X (X: chalcogens, M: metal)) whereas the individual layers are bound by van der Waals interactions through the c-axis (Scheme 1a).11 Depending on the atomic coordination occurring within the individual layers (Scheme 1b), these materials exist in a diverse range of polymorphic forms, such as trigonal prismatic, octahedral and rhombohedral geometry and different stacking orders (e.g. AbA BaB, AcA CbC or AbC AbC). In addition, there are few examples of orthorhombic structure which may be viewed as a distorted NaCl lattice (Scheme 1c).12 The entire aspects of 2D layered nanocrystals, ranging from their anisotropic crystal growth to the unique physicochemical properties, are strongly correlated with these 2D structural features. In this review, we first overview some of the important synthetic approaches for 2D layered metal chalcogenide nanocrystals. Next, the external chemical stimuli driven structural transformations of these nanocrystals, which expand the landscape of these materials to heterogeneous and functional structures, are highlighted. Finally, challenges and opportunities of nanoscale engineering of 2D layered materials are discussed, as some of the studies have shown optimistic results.

2. Strategies for the synthesis of 2D layered metal chalcogenide nanocrystals
During the past two decades, investigations have been carried out to explore efficient routes for the size and shape controlled synthesis of inorganic nanocrystals. Gas-phase synthetic protocols, such as the vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) and thermal evaporation methods, have been developed for the fabrication of interesting nanostructures, including wires, ribbons, and hollow shapes.13 Layered metal chalcogenide nanostructures, in the forms of fullerene like 0D layered spheres and 1D layered tubes, were first synthesized in the gas-phase at high temperatures (700–1000 °C).14 When metal oxides on a quartz substrate are converted into metal sulfides by streaming hydrogen disulfide (H2S) gas at elevated temperature, isolated products are layered quasi-0D nanocrystals. Another high temperature routes via thermal decomposition of metal sulfides (metal = Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb and Ta) under inert atmospheres at 800–900 °C generate 1D tube shape layered nanostructures.15 Suslick and his coworkers introduced new sonochemical and ultrasonic spray pyrolysis methods that produce hollow and porous molybdenum disulfide (MoS2).16,17
Differ from those earlier efforts, new colloidal approaches have been developed for single crystalline 2D nanocrystals under milder synthetic conditions at relatively lower reaction temperatures. Importantly, consideration has been given to the necessity of generating structurally pristine 2D layered, because the properties of layered metal chalcogenide nanocrystals are influenced greatly by the purity and composition.18 For example, titanium disulfide (TiS2) is intrinsically a semiconducting material. However, relatively poor quality TiS2 grown by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method exhibits semimetallic behavior due to the excess Ti atoms intercalated in the van der Waals gap.19 In addition, colloidal synthesis in liquid media serves as a convenient and reproducible technique for the fabrication of nanocrystals with controlled sizes and shapes. This feature enables the resulting nanocrystals to not only be precisely tuned in a variety of size ranges but also to be easily dispersed in organic or aqueous media that are ideal for the numerous potential applications in the electronics and catalysis areas.3,20
Although the details in each method employing the new colloidal approach are different, the growth mechanism of these nanocrystals can be simplified in three steps. (1) Upon heating the reaction medium to a sufficiently high temperature, the precursor chemically decomposes into monomers at a supersaturated level. (2) After burst of nucleation seeds, crystal growth takes place by consumption of monomers. (3) Further growth of nanocrystals proceeds in a fashion that is continuously modulated through surface stabilization by organic surfactants until desired size and structure of nanocrystals are fully executed. In this section, we highlight our reviews on a variety of synthetic protocols for the 2D layered nanocrystals with emphases on representative cases for each protocol.
2.1 Hot injection method
A hot injection method refers to a chemical synthetic method of nanocrystals where injection of cold (room temperature) solution of precursor molecules into hot solvent (180–350 °C) is performed in the presence of surfactant. Initially developed for CdSe quantum dots,21 this method has made an enormous impact as the benchmark synthetic protocol for different types of nanocrystals.22 For the successful preparation of the 2D layered metal chalcogenides, the appropriate choice of reactants (e.g. metal and chalcogen sources) and growth conditions (e.g. mild reaction temperature) is critical to ensure kinetically controlled pathways that keep the intrinsic anisotropic planar growth of 2D nanostructures. By this approach, with the typical use of metal chloride, carboxylate or stannylene precursors, chemical compositions of TiS2,23 ZrS2,24 InSe,25 SnS,26 SnSe,27 SnSe227 and Bi2Te328 with well-defined layered 2D shapes are prepared. Recently, a colloidal synthetic procedure has been utilized to gain control of anisotropic growth with lateral sizes confined to below 100 nm. In the synthesis of zirconium disulfide (ZrS2) nanocrystals, carbon disulfide (CS2) is injected into a mixture of zirconium(IV) tetrachloride (ZrCl4) and oleylamine at 300 °C.24Fig. 1a–c shows the synthesized disc shaped ZrS2 nanocrystals with an average diameter of 20 nm and a thickness of ∼1.6 nm. Moreover, the size of nanocrystals is easily controlled by extending the reaction time to 3 and 6 h with the dimension to 35 and 60 nm, respectively. Inspection of the high-resolution TEM image (Fig. 1d and e) shows that representative individual discs are comprised of three layers of S–Zr–S units, corresponding to two unit cells of 1T-type ZrS2. Finally, the nanodiscs are found to be highly stable to heat and no fragmentation or roll up into a closed structure is observed up to 600 °C.

The anisotropic growth of 2D layered nanocrystals is mainly attributed to the surface energy difference between edge and planar facets. From the Wulff's construction for the equilibrium shape of crystals, crystal facets with lower surface energy tend to grow slower to minimize the total surface energy of the crystal.29 According to ab initio calculation of ZrS2 (Fig. 1f), surface energies (S) of the edge facets, such as (100) or (010) [S(100)/(010) = 57.95 meV Å−1] and (110) [S(110) = 71.76 meV Å−1] are 5–6 times larger than that of the planar (001) facet [S(001) = 12.11 meV Å−1]. Therefore, this induces much faster growth along the ab–plane than the c axis.24
Specific modulations in reaction parameters are also important for 2D layered nanocrystals. The concentrations as well as solubilities of the precursors are found to be critical for the morphological variations of final product. For example, while triangular or hexagonal shaped indium selenide (InSe) nanoplates can be produced (Fig. 2a and b), the low solubility of Se results in nanowire formation (Fig. 2c).25 In contrast, when selenium (Se) powder in oleylamine is first heated to 250 °C and then an indium chloride (InCl3) precursor is injected, triangle or hexagon shapes of layered structures are obtained. In a similar approach, control of the solubility of a chalcogen precursor is attempted by reacting the chalcogen powder with an electron-rich organic compound, such as trioctylphosphine (TOP).30 Accordingly, 2D Bi2Te3 nanoplates are successfully prepared by injecting TOP-Te into a mixture of phenyl ether, oleic acid and octyl ether containing bismuth-2-ethylhexanoate.28 In addition, the molar ratio of the chalcogen source relative to the metal precursor is also demonstrated to be a critical factor for stoichiometry control of 2D layered nanocrystals. This is exemplified by the finding that injection of one molar stoichiometric ratio of di-tert-butyl diselenide into SnCl2 dissolved in dodecylamine and dodecanethiol at 95 °C produces SnSe, whereas two molar ratio yields berndtite SnSe2 phase.27

The use of reactive metal sources, such as bis[bis(trimethylsilyl)amino]tin(II), Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2 (Lappert's stannylene)31 is also effective.26,27,32 For example, when a thioacetamide solution in a mixture of oleylamine (OLA) and TOP is injected into a solution containing Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2, triangular shaped SnS nanocrystals are produced and altering the ratio of OA and OLA leads to spherical nanocrystals. The advantage of this precursor is the higher reactivity in comparison of metal oleate or acetate precursors to have fast nucleation and rapid growth of layered nanocrystals.26
2.2 One-pot heating-up method
In the so-called “heating-up” method, all the reactants and surfactants are first mixed at room temperature and subsequent heating initiates chemical reactions and growth to the formation of nanocrystals. A number of different nanocrystals such as TiS2,33 GeS,34 GeSe,34 TaS2,35 TaSe2,35 NbSe2,36 SnS2,37 SnS,38 SnSe39 and Sb2Te340 nanocrystals are reported. As one of the representative cases, large nanosheets of germanium sulfide (GeS) are obtained by mixing GeI4, hexamethyldisilazine (HMDS), oleylamine, oleic acid and dodecanethiol (sulfur source) at room temperature, followed by heating to 320 °C (Fig. 3a).34 The use of elemental powder as a chalcogen source can also be useful. For example, a mixture of niobium(IV) chloride (NbCl5) and elemental Se in dodecylamine is heated up to yield high quality NbSe2 nanoplates (Fig. 3b).36 Beyond the use of metal halide precursors, single-source molecular precursors have proven to be useful. Single crystalline hexagonal tin disulfide (SnS2) nanoplates with the lateral size below 200 nm are obtained by heating of tin(IV) tetrakis(diethyldithiocarbamate), Sn(S2CNEt2)4, in oleylamine under an inert atmosphere (Fig. 3c).37 On the other hand, a few micron meter sized tin sulfide (SnS) nanosheets, with a thickness of 20 nm are prepared by heating up a mixture of Sn(Ddtc)2(Phen) (Ddtc = diethyldithiocarbamate, Phen = 1,10-phenanthroline), oleylamine and octadecene (Fig. 3d).38

2.3 Solvothermal method
While the methods we described above are based on the protocols via non-hydrolytic environment, one of the well-known traditional synthetic methods for inorganic materials is the aqueous phase solvothermal process. The preparation of Sb2Te3,41,42 Bi2Te3,43 and SnS244 nanoplates by using this method is well-reported. As a representative case, antimony telluride (Sb2Te3) hexagonal nanoplates are prepared by treating the mixture of TeO32− ion salt, Sb(OH)3, tartaric acid (TA), NH3H2O, hydrazine hydrate (N2H4H2O) and H2O at 180 °C in a stainless-steel autoclave.41 Under these alkaline conditions, anionic TeO32− ion salt is reduced to elemental Te and Te2−, which readily reacts with the Sb(III)(TA) complex to form Sb2Te3. Because hydrothermal synthesis is usually conducted without any surfactant, it can be deduced that the anisotropic growth of Sb2Te3 into nanoplates is a natural process. In fact, anisotropic bonding structure of layered materials induces much faster growth along the plane than that along c-axis as the crystalline facets tend to develop on the low-index planes to minimize the surface energy.41
In the hydrothermal synthesis, the choice of metal reducing agent is important. Recently, an ecofriendly route that utilizes an environmentally benign biomolecule (i.e. alginic acid) as a reducing agent is reported. BiCl4 and K2TeO3 are mixed with EDTA, water, alginic acid and NaOH in the autoclave. Then, the mixture is sealed and maintained at 220 °C for 24 h.43 The self-assembled Bi2Te3 hierarchical nanoplates form through structural reformation of Te nanorods. This unique behavior is a consequence of significant differences in the reducing rates of precursors that elemental Te nanorods form first by spontaneous reduction of K2TeO3 by alginic acid, while the reduction of BiCl4 by NaOH is a much slower process. Then, Bi3+ ions nucleate Bi2Te3 upon the consumption of Te nanorods. Although the solvothermal method is attractive, it has not yet been widely used for the synthesis of transition metal chalcogenide nanocrystals.
2.4 Nanocrystal to nanocrystal conversion method
Colloidal nanocrystals possessing anisotropic shapes can serve as precursors for new nanocrystals having different crystal structures and compositions.45 The spatial arrangement of the heterostructure within a nanocrystal, created during dynamic structural and chemical changes, results in a metastable phase. Such energetic instability of interfaces as reaction fronts can initiate the formation of a new type of nanocrystals.46 One of the strategies based on this phenomenon utilizes 1D template nanocrystals for the synthesis of 2D layered nanocrystals. To a solution of tungsten oxide (W18O49) nanorods in hexadecylamine, carbon disulfide (CS2) is injected at 350 °C and the resulting product is single crystalline tungsten sulfide (WS2) nanosheets with the dimension of 40 nm.47 Reaction between CS2 and hexadecylamine generates in situ H2S gas via N-hexadecyldithiocarbamate as a transient species (Fig. 4a). As the sulfidation reaction of nanorods proceed, WS2 are continuously unrolled to form a single-sheet structure from cylindrical tungsten oxide owing to the strains built between the two heterogeneous phases (Fig. 4b and c). Single sheets of WS2 further assemble via van der Waals interactions to form WS2 multiple sheets (Fig. 4d and e). The proposed unrolling mechanism is supported in part by changes in the dimensions of WS2 sheets from 40 to 85 nm when the length of W18O49 nanorods increases from 30 to 75 nm.

3. Structural transformation of 2D layered metal chalcogenide nanocrystals
In addition to the direct synthetic methodologies discussed above, stimuli driven structural transformations of 2D layered nanocrystals can provide new types of heterogeneous and complex 2D layered nanocrystals with opportunities to explore the new principles for their fabrication processes.48 Here we discuss three cases with distinctly unique final structures originated from 2D layered nanocrystals.
3.1 Oriented attachment
Oriented attachment involves spontaneous self-organization of adjacent nanocrystals so that they share common crystallographic orientations.49 Bonding between the crystals reduces the overall energy by removing surface energy associated with unsaturated bonds. The inherent anisotropy of the crystal structure and surface reactivity can induce epitaxial alignment of small nucleates to form assembled nanocrystals.50,51 This unique behavior has been observed in 2D layered nanocrystalline systems. For example, square shaped colloidal tin selenide (SnSe) nanocrystals, with an average dimension of 500 × 500 nm with a thickness of 40 nm, are prepared by heating a mixture of tin chloride (SnCl2), oleylamine and trioctylphosphine selenide (TOP-Se) and hexamethyldisilazine (HMDS) at 240 °C for 30 min.52Fig. 5 shows time dependent TEM observation that insights how the single crystalline SnSe nanosheets are formed. Initially, multiple SnSe nanocrystals nucleate, aggregate, and coalesce to form thin 2D nanosheets via oriented attachments of epitaxial reorientation, driven by relaxation of stress created by mis-orientation at the attachment interfaces (Fig. 5b–e). Following this, crystal growth begins in a pseudo layer-by-layer fashion on the pre-existing nanosheets, which leads to the predominant vertical growth until all of the available SnSe feedstock is consumed (Fig. 5f–i). In this kind of oriented attachment process, thicker nanosheets result from higher precursor concentrations and thinner nanosheets are formed when lower reagent concentrations are used.

3.2 Shape transformation of 2D layered nanocrystals into hollow structure
The peripheral edges of 2D layered nanostructures possess coordinately unsaturated and chemically active sites,53 but the understanding of their roles for the structural transformation has been limited. Recent study shows that peripheral edges of layered nanocrystals can serve as selective nucleation sites for multi-step 2D structural transformations.23 TiS2 nanocrystals are used as a template and copper(II) chloride (CuCl2) is added and then heated at 200 °C. Fig. 6a–d present multiple stages from the TiS2 template to the transformed toroid Cu2S nanocrystals with the exterior diameter of 160 nm and the ring thickness of 30 nm. According to detailed TEM analyses, the following sequential transformation processes occur (Fig. 6e). (1) Regioselective nucleation of Cu2S on a peripheral edge of TiS2, (2) heteroepitaxial growth of Cu2S, and (3) interfacial exchange between Cu and Ti ions and sulfur ion migration toward edges through channels formed by van der Waals interaction between the layers. At this stage, heteroepitaxial growth continuously takes place as indicated by the growth of well-defined interfacial fringes. Finally, these events promote inward growth of Cu2S, eventually producing the double-convex curvature. The observations made in this study are further extended to other cation sources such as Ag, Mn and Cd under similar reaction conditions that produce compositionally unique toroidal intermediates of TiS2–Ag2S, TiS2–MnS and fully converted toroid CdS, respectively (Fig. 6f–h). Conventional shape-transformative reactions of spherical nanocrystals usually lead to the formation of hollow nanostructures having concavo-convex curvature.54,55 In contrast, it is discovered that 2D layered structures behave differently in transformative processes in that they give structurally unique double-convex curvature. This phenomenon is driven by the participation of regioselective edge reactions and ion migrations through nanochannels between layers.23

3.3 Shape transformation of 2D layered nanocrystals into porous nanostructures
While regioselective nucleation on the edges forms toroidal nanocrystals, nucleation over the entire surface of 2D layered nanocrystals can bring their structural transformation into porous nanostructures. SnSe nanosheets are dispersed in TOP-Te and heated to 220 °C and subsequently quenched (Fig. 7a).56Fig. 7b–d represent the TEM images of SnSe template, intermediate and transformed porous SnTe (non-layered crystal structure) nanosheets. SnTe nanosheets retain their average size and 2D morphology defined by the SnSe template but pores are present throughout the nanosheets. SnTe first nucleates on the edges and further decorates the surface of nanosheets upon exchange of Se and Te, and continuous growth of tubular SnTe creates multiples pores. It is worth noting that nanocubes on the surface are oriented in a short range of 90° with respect to another adjoined crystal and 45° relative to the edge (Fig. 7c). The driving force behind the homogeneous anion exchange reaction is claimed as the higher binding energy of the PSe versus the PTe bond. Upon introduction of TOP-Te, selenium dissolutes to form TOP-Se and anion exchange takes place as in analogy of partial anion exchange between CdS and TOP-Te to yield CdS–CdTe heterodimers.57

Selective extraction of cations in 2D layered nanocrystals represents yet another method to produce single-crystalline porous nanoplates (Fig. 8a and b).58 Sb2Te3 hexagonal nanoplates in tartaric acid (TA) are hydrothermally treated at 180 °C for 6 h in the presence of oxygen. The transformation mechanism can be summarized in following. TA selectively dissolutes antimony (Sb) ions at elevated temperature through the formation of Sb(TA)x3+. Meanwhile, Te2− ions on the surface are released and oxidized to Te0 by O2 in the solution (Fig. 8c). The nucleation and growth of Te0 preferentially take place on a nanoplate template. The porosity in nanoplate is attributed by the continuous dissolution of Sb into the media and single-crystalline porous Te nanoplates simultaneously form through the Ostwald ripening mechanism.

4. Outlook and conclusions
Because of their attractive morphological, optoelectronic, and catalytic characteristics, 2D layered metal chalcogenide nanocrystals can potentially be employed in a wide range of applications.59 For example, the void space between the layers enables 2D layered nanocrystals to serve as excellent host materials for the intercalation of guests, such as Li+ ion.24 In fact, the miniaturation of these materials to the nanoscale size provides enhanced discharge capacity and stability compared to the conventional graphite for rechargeable batteries. For example, the capacity retention value of 20 nm ZrS2 nanodiscs is maintained approximately 85% of its original capacity after 50 cycles, whereas that of bulk ZrS2 declines continuously reaching a final value of 39% of the original (Fig. 9). Some layered metal chalcogenide (e.g. SnSe, MoS2, WS2 and more) nanocrystals have suitable band gap energies (0.7–1.4 eV) with high absorption coefficient, which are critical for solar energy harvesting and photocatalytic applications.57,59,60 Because the layers of cations are separated by van der Waals gap, these materials can possess exceptional chemical and environmental stability upon photoexcitation. In addition, d-electrons of the metals can give rise to new physical phenomena, including excellent electrical transport properties and high on/off ratios that are ideal for use in optoelectronic and solid-state junction devices.4,5 Lastly, layered metal chalcogenides have long been an important subject in catalysis, for e.g. hydrodesulphurization in the petroleum industry (Scheme 2). The catalytic activity of layered materials is localized to edges whereas the central plane is chemically inert. In this regard, the large edge to volume ratio of 2D layered nanocrystals is critical to have high catalytic performance.

 Scheme 2  2D layered nanocrystals can serve as a versatile platform for various applications such as energy storage, photovoltaic, optoelectronics and catalysis. 
In this brief review focusing on the synthesis and structural transformations of 2D layered metal chalcogenide nanocrystals, we have shown that layered structures and shape anisotropy strongly govern the 2D crystal growth and also their unique shape transformation processes. There are ample opportunities and challenges that must be addressed before 2D layered nanostructures reach their full potential in practical applications. Thus far, limited numbers of 2D layered metal chalcogenide nanocrystals have been reported and further efforts are needed to widen the range of chemical compositions. New rational design concepts and a better understanding of heterostructure 2D layered nanocrystals will promote the generation of enhanced materials properties and multifunctional utilities. We foresee this review may contribute to apprehend the wide opportunities of future 2D layered nanomaterials.
