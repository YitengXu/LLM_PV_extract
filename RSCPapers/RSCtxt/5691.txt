    , Accepted 3rd August 2016First published on 4th August 2016AbstractThe traditional fabrication of graphene-based devices requires polymer-assisted transfer of graphene and a removal procedure of polymer coatings. Here, we propose to turn this process on its head and demonstrate a novel strategy of polymer-coated graphene as an optically antireflective and transparent electrode used in a graphene/silicon (G/Si) solar cell. No additional polymer removal and antireflection coatings (e.g. TiO2 colloids) are needed in our strategy. By engineering the thickness of polymer protective coatings, the light absorption and short-circuit current density of graphene solar cells can be greatly enhanced. We also showed that retaining the polymer coatings avoided the degradation of electrical conductivity of graphene films. With HNO3 doping applied on PMMA-coated G/Si solar cells, the PCEs can reach up to 13.34%. The long-term stabilities of HNO3 doped G/Si solar cells are also improved by using fluoropolymer (CYTOP) coatings on graphene. Our approach provides a novel fabrication method of transparent graphene electrodes for graphene-based optoelectronic devices with excellent light absorption.
Introduction
Graphene/silicon (G/Si) solar cells are a new type of photovoltaic device, which can separate photo-generated carriers by Schottky junctions formed between graphene and Si. In contrast to the fabrication of conventional monocrystalline silicon solar cells, the assembly of G/Si heterojunction devices only requires transfer of graphene films onto Si substrates in an ambient atmosphere and at room temperature, thus avoiding high vacuum systems and high temperature furnaces. The pioneering work on G/Si solar cells has demonstrated power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of ∼2%.1 In order to further boost the PCEs of G/Si solar cells, many different strategies have been proposed. For example, chemical doping of graphene has been used to enhance its electrical conductivity and improve the performance of G/Si solar cells. Our and other groups' previous studies have shown that some acidic or oxidative molecules, such as HNO3,2–4 AuCl3,5–7 and bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI),6,8 can induce effective p-type doping in graphene, thus leading to reduced series resistance and enhanced carrier separation between graphene and n-type Si. Coupled with interfacial engineering, chemical doping has been shown to increase the PCE of G/Si solar cells to 10.56%.9 Besides chemical doping of graphene, light trapping with antireflection coatings (ARCs) is another important strategy to boost the PCEs of G/Si solar cells. One of the light trapping strategies is by creating micro- or nano-structures on the Si substrate in order to reduce reflection.10–14 Although such a strategy has produced G/Si solar cells with high PCEs of ∼10%,12 the etching of planar Si might reduce the conformal contact between graphene and Si, and can also weaken the charge separation of Schottky junctions, which impedes the further enhancement of PCEs. Recently, a TiO2-based ARC has been successfully applied to G/Si solar cells, in virtue of its high refractive index (∼2.2), which is near the square root of the product of refractive indexes of Si and air , and thus leads to a good antireflection effect. Shi et al. reported a PCE of 14.5% for G/Si solar cells with both TiO2 ARC and HNO3 doping.15 By combining the techniques of TiO2 ARC, AuCl3 doping and interfacial oxide layer engineering, the PCEs of G/Si solar cells can be further boosted, reaching a record in the high conversion efficiency of 15.6%.16 Despite this excellent performance, the formation of a TiO2 ARC on graphene requires the removal of the PMMA protective layer, and the spin-coating of TiO2 sol–gels will probably degrade the electrical conductivity of the graphene. These impede the large-scale production of these materials due to the relatively complex fabrication process.
In fact, besides the inorganic coating layers, polymers are also possible candidates for ARCs. However, the utilization of polymer optical coatings on graphene has been rarely explored for optoelectronic applications. In fact, some polymers with a relatively high refractive index, e.g., poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA, n ≈ 1.5)17 and polystyrene (PS, n ≈ 1.6),18 are highly transparent to visible light. In spite of exhibiting lower refractive indices when compared to inorganic ARCs, polymer coatings are lightweight, bendable and stretchable. With an optimized composition and morphology, polymer ARCs have great potential as light management materials in flexible and wearable optic devices. On the other hand, polymer coatings have been used when fabricating CVD-graphene devices as protection layers during large-area transfer processes.19,20 Traditionally, polymer protective coatings are considered as intermediates during graphene transfer processes, and are usually removed after transfer.21,22 Although previous reports have demonstrated that retaining polymer coatings can act as encapsulation layers for graphene-based flexible organic solar cells (OSCs) and field-effect transistors (FETs),23,24 the optical function of transparent polymer-coated graphene still needs to be explored.
Moreover, it is worth noting that previous reports on G/Si solar cells did not use polymer coatings as ARCs in the device structure.1,16 The polymers were usually removed after graphene films were transferred onto Si substrates.16 In this contribution, we report the direct use of polymer-supported graphene sheets in G/Si solar cells, as transparent conductive electrodes with enhanced light absorption. Furthermore, a critical SC-2 (Standard Clean Procedure No. 2, Radio Corporation of America) cleaning step was adopted in our strategy to increase the electrical conductivity of graphene sheets and facilitate the conformal contact between graphene and Si. With chemical doping using HNO3, the average PCEs of the constructed photovoltaic devices are boosted to 13.34%. We also reproduced similar results with different polymers (e.g. fluoropolymer), thus demonstrating the reproducibility and versatility of our strategy when fabricating high-performance graphene-based devices.
Experimental
Synthesis of graphene samples
Graphene samples were synthesized by low pressure CVD as described in a previous report.25 A 25 μm-thick Cu foil (Alfa Aesar) was used as the substrate and annealed at 1000 °C in hydrogen for 30 min. Graphene was then grown on the substrate at 1000 °C for 30 min with hydrogen and methane at a total pressure of 50 Pa.
Polymer-assisted transfer of graphene
PMMA with Mw ≈ 50000 g mol−1 was purchased from 6Carbon Technology (Shenzhen) and dissolved in ethyl lactate (Aladdin) at 4 wt%. PMMA with Mw ≈ 550000 g mol−1 was purchased from Alfa Aesar and dissolved in anisole (Aladdin) at 3 wt%. Dissolved PMMA was spin-coated onto graphene/Cu samples at different spinning rates for 60 s and cured at 90 °C for 60 min on a hot plate. CYTOP solution (CTL-809M, Asahi Glass) was diluted with perfluorotributylamine (CT-SOLV180, Asahi Glass) at a mass ratio of 1:1, and then spin-coated onto graphene/Cu samples at 5000 rpm. CYTOP samples were annealed at 140 °C for 60 min. Polymer-coated graphene/Cu samples were placed in FeCl3/HCl (0.5 M/0.5 M) solution to etch Cu away. After the removal of Cu, polymer-coated graphene was transferred onto the water surface for a 20 min cleaning with ultrapure (UP)-water, and subsequently a 10 min cleaning in SC-2 solution (HCl/H2O2/H2O = 1:1:10, v/v) and three cycles of 20 min UP-water cleaning. Finally, polymer-coated graphene was transferred onto the target substrates (e.g. Si wafer, quartz glass slide) and dried at room temperature. To remove PMMA layers, the transferred graphene samples were immersed in acetone for 30 s and subsequently in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) for 30 s, each twice. After the removal of PMMA, samples were dried with N2 flow.
Characterization methods
Scanning electron microscopy characterization of the cross-section of PMMA-coated G/Si solar cells was performed using a Zeiss Merlin. Atomic force microscopy characterization was performed on a Bruker Dimension Icon. A graphene field effect transistor was fabricated on a Si wafer with a 300 nm thermal oxide layer, and characterized using a Keithley 4200 Semiconductor Characterization System. Optical images of PMMA-coated graphene on silicon wafer were obtained with a Zeiss Axio Scope.A1. Transmittance spectra of graphene samples on quartz slides were recorded by using a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer. Reflectance spectra of G/Si solar cells were obtained by using a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrophotometer. Raman spectra of graphene samples on a SiO2/Si wafer were measured by using a Horiba Jobin Yvon Evolution with a 532 nm laser.
Fabrication and measurement of G/Si solar cells
Si wafers (n-type, 2–4 Ω cm) with a 300 nm oxide layer were patterned to form a 0.3 cm × 0.3 cm Si window on the top side. Patterned Ti/Au (10 nm/50 nm) electrodes were deposited on the top side. Ti/Au (10 nm/50 nm) was also deposited on the backside as back electrodes. Polymer-coated graphene samples were transferred onto these Si wafers to form Schottky junction solar cells. HNO3 doping was performed by placing the solar cells over a 68% nitric acid for 15 s (PMMA-removed samples) or 30 s (polymer-coated samples). The current–voltage characteristics of G/Si solar cells were recorded with a Keithley 2601 source meter. Photovoltaic performance was measured under air mass 1.5G (AM1.5G) illumination of a Newport 91159 solar simulator with a calibrated light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The quantum efficiencies of G/Si solar cells were recorded using a PV Measurements QEX10 system.
Results and discussion
Our fabrication process of G/Si solar cells is illustrated in Fig. 1a. Following the common process of graphene transfer, PMMA (Mw ≈ 50000 mol g−1, 4 wt% in ethyl lactate) was spin-coated onto graphene with a specified speed (e.g. 1000–3000 rpm). Subsequently, the copper substrate underneath the graphene film was etched away in FeCl3/HCl solution, leaving PMMA-coated graphene floating on the water surface. After the etchant residue was washed away with SC-2 solution (HCl/H2O2/H2O = 1:1:10, v/v) and ultrapure (UP) water, the final polymer-coated graphene was ‘fished out’ from the water using a planar and patterned silicon wafer with back and top Ti/Au electrodes (see Fig. 1a and S2a†) to form a G/Si heterojunction solar cell device. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to characterize the morphology of the as-prepared graphene films. It can be seen from Fig. S1a† that the graphene film is homogeneous and with no detectable structural damage caused by the wet transfer process. Based on the height profile shown in the inset of Fig. S1a,† it can be deduced that the graphene films are mainly monolayer structures. Field effect transistors (FETs) were fabricated using bare graphene and PMMA-coated graphene to demonstrate the carrier transport behaviors. The Ids–Vg plots (Fig. S1b and c†) demonstrate a similar ambipolar field effect of both devices, indicating that PMMA layers have a negligible effect on the carrier transport behavior of graphene. This is also in agreement with previous reports on polymer-coated graphene FETs.23,26

Fig. 1b demonstrates the scanning electron microscopy image of the cross-section of a G/Si solar cell with a PMMA coating (spun at 2000 rpm). In the region shown in Fig. 1b, the thickness of the PMMA layer is measured to be 125 to 137 nm. Fig. 1c and d correspond to the optical microscopy images and Fig. S2† to photographs of fabricated G/Si solar cells with and without PMMA layers; they show a weaker reflection than those without PMMA coatings. The colors of PMMA-coated devices are dark blue and brown, different from the bright and shiny grey surface with the PMMA-removed ones (Fig. 1b). Optical images (Fig. 1c–e) also reveal the difference of the PMMA-coated G/Si devices with different spinning rates. For those with higher spinning rates, the PMMA layers are thinner and smoother, thus resulting in a darker color of the G/Si regions. The morphology of PMMA-coated graphene on silicon was also measured with a stylus surface profiler. For the PMMA-coated G/Si devices with spinning rates of 1000, 2000 and 3000 rpm, the average thicknesses of PMMA coatings were determined to be 134, 108 and 89 nm, respectively. Table S1† compares the difference in surface profiles of polymer coatings with various spinning rates. It can be observed that both the thickness and roughness of polymer coatings were thinned for those formed at higher spinning rates.
In order to investigate the optical properties of PMMA-coated and PMMA-removed graphene samples, we performed transmission measurements by using quartz glasses as substrates (Fig. 2a). For graphene samples without PMMA coatings, the results show a transmittance of 97.4% at 550 nm, and 97.7% at ∼800 nm, indicating that the graphene film is mainly a single layer.27 For the PMMA-coated sample, the transmittance is slightly lower than that of bare graphene in the region of 400–800 nm. Owing to the transparency and sub-micron thickness of PMMA coatings, the loss of transmission light induced by the absorbance of PMMA is almost negligible, as the transmittance at 550 nm measured was 96.0% with PMMA coatings (Fig. 2a). Typical Raman spectra (inset of Fig. 2a) reveal a small number of layers and a good degree of crystallinity of the as-synthesized graphene. Despite their slightly lower transparency, the photovoltaic performance of PMMA-coated graphene films on G/Si solar cells is significantly superior to that of PMMA-removed ones. Fig. 2b compares the current density (J)–voltage (V) curves of the illuminated G/Si solar cells with and without PMMA coatings. The open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and PCE of the as-fabricated devices with PMMA-removed graphene were determined to be 0.428 V, 22.61 mA cm−2, 32.22% and 3.12%, respectively. The pristine solar cell with PMMA coating displayed a significantly higher Jsc, FF and PCE of 33.64 mA cm−2, 45.56% and 6.55%, respectively. In order to boost the FF and PCE, we performed chemical doping of G/Si solar cells via HNO3 vapor treatment as described previously.2 As shown in Table 1, doping with HNO3 vapor remarkably improved the performance of the PMMA-coated G/Si solar cell, leading to a Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE of 0.556 V, 34.00 mA cm−2, 70.63% and 13.34%, respectively. By comparison, the HNO3 doped solar cell fabricated with PMMA-removed graphene showed an improved PCE of 9.40%, which is very close to the established limit (∼10%) for possible commercialization.28 The HNO3 doping has no obvious effect on the thickness of the PMMA layer, as shown by surface profile measurements (Table S1†). We further compared the anti-reflection effect of PMMA with TiO2 ARCs by spin-coating TiO2 colloids onto PMMA-removed G/Si solar cells, following a previous report by Shi et al.15 As shown in Table S3,† the efficiencies of TiO2-coated G/Si solar cells are lower than 1%, which are remarkably inferior to those of PMMA-coated G/Si solar cells. The poorer performance of TiO2-coated G/Si solar cells might be attributed to the negative effect of the organic solvents (i.e. ethanol and acetyl acetone) of TiO2 colloids. Nevertheless, the anti-reflection effect of TiO2 coatings can be estimated by extracting saturated current density (Jsat) under AM1.5G illumination. The Jsat values of TiO2-coated G/Si cells are from 32.23 to 35.29 mA cm−2, which are slightly higher than those of PMMA-coated cells. However, such enhancement in light absorption does not contribute to the improvement of G/Si solar cell efficiency, and applying TiO2 coatings complicates the fabrication of devices.

The improvement of PCE in PMMA-coated G/Si solar cells can be attributed to the increased Jsc, which is possibly a result of decreased resistance of Schottky junctions and the increment of light absorption. According to the thermionic-emission theory, the J–V characteristic of an ideal Schottky diode can be expressed as: (1) (2)where J0 is the saturated reverse current density, e is the electric charge of electrons, n is the ideality factor, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, A* is the effective Richardson constant (∼0.252 mA cm−2 K−2 for n-type Si), Φb is the Schottky barrier height, and A is the effective area of the diode. The current (I) is the product of current density (J) and diode area (A). The ideality factor (n) and Schottky (Φb) barrier height can be extracted from the (lnI)–V plot by measuring the saturated reverse current density, and the series resistance (Rs) can be calculated as the slope of dV/d(lnI) versus I.
The dark J–V and (lnI)–V curves (Fig. S4a–d†) of untreated devices were analyzed to reveal the characteristics of Schottky diodes. For G/Si solar cells without PMMA coatings, the ideality factor (n) and Schottky barrier height (Φb) are extracted as 1.15 and 0.79 eV, respectively. Similarly, n and Φb of PMMA-coated cells were 1.16 and 0.71 eV, respectively, exhibiting no significant difference to the un-coated G/Si devices. In addition, the series resistance of PMMA-coated devices (Rs ≈ 26 Ω) is lower that of than the un-coated ones (Rs ≈ 63 Ω). Reports have shown that the resistance of the transferred graphene films will degrade due to possible fractures and PMMA residues during the removal process.22,29 Therefore, PMMA removal is not necessary in the fabrication of G/Si solar cells, as the pristine electrical conductivity of graphene can be still maintained and, more importantly, PMMA can actually serve as a protection and antireflection layer.
To further elucidate the possible mechanism of how PMMA coatings improve Jsc and PCE, we carried out measurements of reflectance and quantum efficiency (QE) on the as-fabricated G/Si solar cells. As shown in Fig. 2c, the reflection in the wavelength region of 300–1000 nm is suppressed if PMMA coatings remain on G/Si solar cells. For the PMMA layer coated at a spinning rate of 1000 rpm, the reflectance drops with the increase of the wavelength. For the coatings with spinning rates of 2000 and 3000 rpm, the lowest points in the reflectance spectra appear at ca. 810 and 700 nm, respectively. According to the interference equation, the reflectance of the planar substrate coated with a single-layer thin film can be expressed as:30 (3)where n1, n0 and ns are the refractive indices of the coating material, air and substrate, respectively. The shift-in-phase is denoted as θ and is equal to 4πn1d/λ, where d is the thickness of the coating film and λ is the wavelength of light in a vacuum. The theoretical reflectance R(λ) reaches lowest points at mλ = 4n1d, where m is odd (m = 1, 3, 5,…), and the best antireflection effect is achieved. However, when m is an even number (m = 2, 4, 6,…), peak values of R(λ) appear, meaning that there is no anti-reflection effect at these spectral wavelengths. In other words, applying an ARC with a certain thickness d will selectively enhance the light absorption in the spectral range of interest. As the solar radiation power lies mostly in the spectral range of 400 to 800 nm (i.e. visible and near-infrared), it is significant to match the anti-reflection effect of PMMA coatings with the solar spectrum in order for the best photovoltaic performance. Besides consideration of optics, the PMMA layer cannot be too thin to mechanically protect the graphene layer. We found that a higher spin rate of 3000 rpm will generate thinner and weaker PMMA/graphene films, which might break easily and are unusable for the fabrication of solar cells. In addition, the surface of the spin-coated PMMA layer on graphene is not flat as assumed in ARC optics. We suppose that the rough surface of ARCs will induce a more gradual reflectance spectrum R(λ) than the surface of the theoretical one. As shown in Fig. 2c, there are no peak points of reflectance of PMMA-coated cells where R(λ) equals to that of the bare G/Si cell, which are expected in optical theory. Thus, rough PMMA coatings are supposed to enhance the absorption in a wide spectral range that covers the solar spectrum better than flat ones.
With the simulation program OPAL 2 and refractive index data of graphene measured by Weber et al.,31,32 we carried out calculations of the reflectance within PMMA-coated G/Si solar cells. The thickness of the graphene layer is set as 1 nm according to the AFM results. The reflectance spectra of the simulated models are shown in Fig. S5.† The simulated reflectance spectrum of PMMA-removed G/Si matches very well with experimental data (Fig. 3c and S5a†). Disregarding the small reflection induced by graphene, the thickness (d) of PMMA layers coated at 2000 and 3000 rpm estimated by d = λ/4n1, (n1 ≈ 1.5 for PMMA) is 135 and 117 nm, respectively, according to eqn (3). Thicknesses of 117, 135 and 145 nm in the PMMA layer are included in the model respectively. Fig. S5b–d† show that with thinner PMMA layers, the lowest point of reflectance shows a blue shift. With a 117 nm PMMA layer, the reflectance is diminished in the visible spectral range, which is preferred in solar power conversion. If the thickness of PMMA increases, more anti-reflection effects are distributed in the near-infrared and near-ultraviolet region instead of in the visible region. Such a phenomenon is consistent with the experimental results. The simulated reflectance spectra of PMMA-coated G/Si (Fig. 3b–d) are different to the measured ones because the surface of PMMA is rough and the interface beneath is planar, which is beyond the simulation capability of OPAL 2. Despite this, the anti-reflection effect of PMMA coating is very significant in both theoretical simulations and experimental measurements.
 Fig. 3  Effect of SC-2 treatment on G/Si solar cells. (a) Dark and illuminated J–V curves of G/Si solar cells with no SC-2 treatment step during fabrication. It can be seen that the current density and fill factor are relatively low. (b) Comparison of sheet resistance of graphene films with and without SC-2 treatment. Graphene samples were transferred onto patterned printed circuit boards (PCBs) for resistance measurement. Measured current, length and width of the sample are denoted as i, l and w, respectively. The length and width are 3.3 and 2.0 mm for the SC-2 treated sample, and 3.3 mm and 3.7 mm for the sample without SC-2 treatment, respectively. 
Therefore, it can be inferred that the destructive interference effect of sub-micron-thick PMMA layers leads to enhanced light absorption of G/Si solar cells. Furthermore, QE tests elucidate the effect of such polymer ARCs on graphene silicon solar cells. As depicted in Fig. 2d, the QEs, or incident photon-to-current efficiencies (IPCE), of PMMA-coated G/Si solar cells are significantly higher than those of the bare devices without PMMA coatings. The QE spectra of PMMA layers coated at various spinning rates exhibit similar trends in the reflectance spectra; as for lower spinning rates, the highest QE enhancement appears at longer wavelengths in the visible region. Interestingly, PMMA coated at 1000 rpm shows the lowest reflectance and the highest QE in the region of 300–370 nm (UV region), which is caused by a high order of interference (t = 3λ/4n). Nevertheless, the QE spectra of G/Si solar cells with PMMA coated at 2000 and 3000 rpm matched the solar spectrum better than those coated at 1000 rpm. As shown in Fig. 2d, the QE of G/Si solar cells is higher in the visible and near-IR range (400–800 nm) with PMMA coated at 2000 and 3000 rpm. Thus, the G/Si solar cells with 2000 and 3000 rpm coated PMMA layers are expected to show better performance. We fabricated solar cells with PMMA-coated graphene (1000 and 3000 rpm), which demonstrate PCEs of 3.42% and 3.49% before HNO3 doping, and 11.12% and 11.29% after doping. Detailed parameters are listed in Table S2.† Therefore, one can confirm that the coating of PMMA induces destructive interference and an antireflection effect, and results in remarkably improved performances of G/Si solar cells.
In order to achieve superior performances of graphene-based devices, not only synthesis but also the transfer process is important to obtain clean and high-quality graphene. However, for the fabrication of G/Si solar cells, the optimization of the transfer process has rarely been reported hitherto. In our approach, a 10 min treatment of PMMA-coated graphene in SC-2 solution (HCl/H2O2/H2O = 1:1:10, v/v) is adopted during the transfer, thus obtaining pristine G/Si solar cells with PCE larger than 4.4%. We then repeated the fabrication procedure (with the PMMA coating remaining) excluding the SC-2 cleaning step, and observed G/Si solar cells with poor performances. As shown in Fig. 3a and Table S4,† without SC-2 treatment, the Voc, Jsc, and FF were all inferior to those of the solar cell samples fabricated with graphene treated by SC-2; PCE values were below 1.0%. These low performance solar cells had series resistances several times higher than those with SC-2 treated graphene films, together with a higher barrier height (Φb) of ∼0.80 eV (Fig. S2f†). We also transferred PMMA-coated graphene samples, both with and without SC-2 treatment, on a print circuit board (PCB) to measure the resistances (Fig. S6†). It can be extracted from the V–I curves (Fig. 3b) that graphene without SC-2 treatment shows a much higher resistance (R = 13.5 kΩ, Rsheet = 15.1 kΩ sq−1) than the SC-2 treated one (R = 9.17 kΩ, Rsheet = 5.56 kΩ sq−1). The effect of SC-2 treatment can be clarified as follows: the etching process leaves metal oxides and hydroxides particles trapped on the surface of graphene,29 SC-2 solution can effectively dissolve these contaminants, eliminate the degradation of electrical conductivity, and enable appropriate Schottky contact between graphene and silicon.
In order to prove the versatility of our strategy, we further applied different types of polymer coatings on G/Si solar cells. PMMA with a higher average molecular weight (Mw ≈ 550000 mol g−1, 3 wt% in anisole) was coated onto graphene at spinning rates of 1000, 3000 and 5000 rpm, with average thicknesses of 257, 139 and 72 nm, respectively. G/Si solar cells were fabricated as described above, with PCEs of more than 11% after HNO3 doping (details in Table S2†). As depicted in Fig. 4a and listed in Table S2,† with higher spinning rates and thinner thicknesses, the PMMA-coated G/Si solar cells showed an increment in Jsc, thus implying a better antireflection effect. Despite its extensive usage in graphene transfers, PMMA is vulnerable to organic solvents, concentrated acids and bases, and UV radiation. Aiming at stabilization of photovoltaic performance of polymer-coated G/Si solar cells, a transparent fluoropolymer, perfluoro(1-butenyl vinyl ether) homocyclopolymer (commercial name of CYTOP), was also coated onto graphene as a supporting layer. CYTOP is a transparent fluoropolymer with chemical resistance to many inorganic and organic solvents, which is better than PMMA, but with a lower refractive index (n = 1.34).33 A CYTOP solution was coated on graphene and cured, thus forming a 96 nm thick coating. G/Si solar cells fabricated with CYTOP-coated graphene showed a Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE of 0.393 V, 27.61 mA cm−2 and 32.65% before doping, and 0.523 V, 32.52 mA cm−2 and 66.97% after HNO3 doping, respectively, and the PCE was boosted more than 3 times from 3.54% to 11.39%. The J–V curves of CYTOP-coated G/Si solar cell can be seen in Fig. 4b. However, HNO3 doped solar cells will degrade after storage under ambient conditions due to the evaporation of HNO3 molecules. G/Si solar cells coated with PMMA and CYTOP were both stored together as long as 135 days and photovoltaic performances were recorded during this period, as demonstrated in Fig. 4c–f. Even though the PMMA-coated sample had a higher performance right after doping, it had degraded (PCE = 5.27%) when compared to its pristine state (PCE = 6.55%) after 6 days of storage (Fig. 4f). After 72 days, the PMMA-coated sample (PCE = 3.74%) was remarkably inferior to the aged CYTOP-coated sample (PCE = 6.33%) (details in Table S2†). When compared to the CYTOP-coated cell, the degradation of the PMMA-coated G/Si solar cell mainly leads to a reduced FF (Fig. 4e), implying increased resistance of graphene and the growth of a silicon oxide layer due to the presence of oxygen and moisture. Meanwhile, the CYTOP coating layer had better protection of graphene against surrounding contaminants because of its hydrophobic and oleophobic nature, thus preventing unwanted degradation and improving the long-term performance of G/Si solar cells. They lead to a relatively stable PCE of 5.98–6.33% between day 29 and day 135. In contrast, the PCE of polymer-removed G/Si solar cells dropped dramatically to 3.44% after 135 days of storage (Fig. 4f). We have shown that the molecular dopants will vaporize during the storage.2 In the case of polymer-coated G/Si solar cells, the gaseous doping molecules (e.g. HNO3) can permeate through the polymer layer. During the storage under ambient conditions, some dopants get trapped at the interface of the polymer and graphene, thus maintaining a doping effect, while other dopants evaporate. When PMMA is used as the coating material, the trapped HNO3 molecules may react with PMMA and produce contaminants that degrade the G/Si Schottky junction. There is no such problem if CYTOP is coated onto graphene, as the fluoropolymer is resistant to HNO3 and other molecules. Therefore, the CYTOP-coated G/Si solar cells have a clear long-term stability. These results confirm the screening effect of polymer protection on G/Si solar cells.

Conclusions
In summary, polymers are proved to be effective optical antireflection coatings for G/Si solar cells in addition to acting as the conventional protection layers for graphene transfers. The G/Si solar cells fabricated with polymer-coated graphene showed excellent PCEs of more than 11.12% after HNO3 doping, and the best PCE up to 13.34% was recorded with PMMA-coated graphene. The enhancement of photovoltaic efficiency and light current can be attributed to the retained electrical conductivity of graphene, enhanced light absorption by polymer coatings, and reduced resistance by SC-2 treatment. The polymer protective coatings also improve the stability of G/Si solar cells. We believe that this strategy not only provides a cost-effective and simplified fabrication procedure for G/Si solar cells, but also opens up new avenues for improving light transmission and eliminating reflection in graphene-based optoelectronics, such as solar cells, photodetectors, and light-emission devices.
