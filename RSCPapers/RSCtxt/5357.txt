J. Anal. At. Spectrom., 1987, 2, 79R-114RAtomic Spectrometry Update—Instrumentation(Note: The full text of this document is currently only available in the PDF Version )John Marshall, Stephen J. Haswell and Stephen J. HillAbstractThis review describes developments in all aspects of atomic spectroscopic instrumentation reported in the Atomic Spectrometry Update References in JAAS, Volume 1 (86/710–86/2039) and Volume 2 (87/1–87/637). Thus it follows the review published last year (87/417). The full references, names and addresses of authors can be readily found from the Atomic Spectrometry Update References in the relevant issues of JAAS, however, as an additional service to readers an abbreviated form of each literature reference quoted (except for those to Conference Proceedings) is given at the end of the review. This innovation is in response to suggestions from readers, and other comments as to possible improvements in future reviews are always welcome. It is hoped that succeeding reviews in this series will be extended to include X-ray spectrometry although this current review is principally concerned with the instrumentation for AAS, AFS, AES and ICP-MS.
