    , Accepted 1st July 2022First published on 4th July 2022AbstractPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) have made huge progress with a record power conversion efficiency of up to 25.8% (certified 25.5%) in the last decade. Hole transporting materials (HTMs) are essential for obtaining high-efficiency PSCs which play a crucial role in extracting and transporting holes from the perovskite layer to the electrodes. To date, only two HTMs have led to the state-of-the-art performance in PSCs, namely, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) and poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA). However, these HTMs have a few drawbacks in terms of commercialization, including high production costs, and the need for hygroscopic dopants which deteriorate the long-term stability of PSC devices. Herein, this article reviews the great progress of dopant-free HTMs for PSC devices in the past two years, outlining the reports of chemical structures with promising properties toward achieving effective HTMs for devices with long-term stability. In particular, HTMs are classified based on the different perovskite materials, in contrast to the previous reviews that categorized the HTMs according to molecular structures or device architectures. Finally, detailed conclusions and outlooks of dopant-free HTMs toward commercial application are provided. We hope that this review can attract more attention and attempts to develop more low-cost dopant-free HTMs for highly efficient and stable PSCs.

Broader context
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as one of the promising third generation photovoltaic technologies with a low cost of manufacturing and comparable efficiency since 2009. Considerable progress has been made over the last decade in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs from 3.8% to 25.8%. However, high-efficiency PSCs based on doped hole transporting materials (HTMs) are still facing challenges in cost and stability. Developing dopant-free HTMs at a low-cost is an alternative way to achieve high-efficiency and stable PSCs simultaneously. In this article, we review very recent important advances in dopant-free HTMs providing high efficiency and enhanced stability for devices with different perovskite materials. Based on the correlation study between the molecular properties and device performance, design principles of ideal HTMs for commercialization are summarized to motivate further research of such materials in the future. And some perspectives on the development of dopant-free HTMs are provided. We hope this review will be helpful in advancing the development of dopant-free HTMs for efficient, stable and low-cost PSCs.

1. Introduction
In today's world, climate change has emerged as one of the biggest environmental challenges. Solar energy plays an important role in combating climate change as an alternative to fossil fuels.1–3 Solar cells are one of the most important technologies in solar energy. As one of the third generation solar cells, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention for industrial application because of their excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) and low-cost fabrication.4–11 In particular, the PCE of the PSC devices has already increased from 3.8% to 25.8% only in the past decade.12,13 The record PCE is very close to that of crystalline silicon-based solar cells (26.7%).14 We believe that the PCE will exceed that of crystalline silicon solar cells very soon. Moreover, the long-term stability of the PSC devices has been significantly improved.15–19 Brabec's group reported that the unencapsulated device retained 99% of its initial efficiency after 1450 h of continuous operation at 65 °C under metal-halide lamps in a nitrogen atmosphere.20 Therefore, considering the high power outputs and low production costs, PSCs will be the most promising solar cell technology shortly.
The general chemical structure of perovskite materials can be represented as ABX3, where A is a monovalent cation such as CH3NH3+ (MA+), (NH2)2CH+ (FA+) or Cs+, B is a divalent cation such as Pb2+ or Sn2+, and X is a monovalent anion such as Cl−, Br− or I−, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a).21 Owing to the unique properties of perovskite materials such as strong light-harvesting ability, low exciton binding energy, long charge carrier diffusion length (∼1 μm), high mobility (>10 cm2 V−1 s−1), and efficient ambipolar charge transport,22–24 the performance of PSCs has witnessed explosive growth in a short time.25 Typical PSC devices often include a perovskite material, a hole transporting material (HTM), an electron transporting material (ETM), and electrodes.26,27 Because of the ambipolar charge transport properties of perovskite materials, both conventional n–i–p and inverted p–i–n type PSCs can work effectively.28,29 As illustrated in Fig. 1(b), the three common device architectures are (1) mesoporous n–i–p, (2) planar n–i–p, and (3) inverted p–i–n. The most commonly used mesoporous n–i–p PSC devices have a structure of FTO/TiO2/(mp)-TiO2/perovskite/2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis [N,N-di(4-methoxyl phenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD)/Au with the highest PCE of 24.8%,30 while the most common planar n–i–p type devices have a structure of FTO/SnO2/perovskite/Sprio-OMeTAD/Au with a champion PCE of 25.8%.13 Very recently, the PCE of the inverted p–i–n PSCs has exceeded 25.0% with a structure of ITO/poly[bis(4-phenyl) (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA)/perovskite/ferrocenyl-bis-thiophene-2-carboxylate (FcTc2)/fullerene-C60/bathocuproine (BCP)/Al.31 Therefore, currently, the most common and effective HTMs used in PSC devices are Spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA.

Spiro-OMeTAD possesses an optical bandgap of 2.9 eV, and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of −5.2 eV and −2.3 eV, respectively.32 The orthogonal structure of spirofluorene strongly hinders the formation of π–π stacking, while the propeller-type triphenylamine leads to a large intermolecular distance, resulting in low hole mobility (∼10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and conductivity (∼10−8 S cm−1).33 In 2012, the doped Spiro-OMeTAD was first introduced into the n–i–p-type PSC devices as an HTM by both Park and Snaith groups, achieving PCEs of 9.7% and 10.9%, respectively.4,34 To date, the champion PCE of the doped Spiro-OMeTAD-based PSCs is up to 25.8%.13 The common used dopants are given in Fig. 2(a), including 4-tert-butylpyridine (t-BP), lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI), and tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)cobalt(III)tri(bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide) (FK209). After doping with these dopants, the Spiro-OMeTAD layer exhibits over ten-fold increased hole mobility (∼10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and two orders of magnitude enhanced conductivity (∼10−5 S cm−1).35 The doping mechanisms are clearly shown in Fig. 2(c); the basic p-doping process is a charge transfer reaction between the dopants and Spiro-OMeTAD.36,37 Although the efficiencies of PSCs have significantly improved, the detrimental impacts of the dopants on the long-term stability of devices are not negligible. These dopants are hygroscopic and tend to absorb moisture from the environment, which can accelerate perovskite degradation, as shown in Fig. 2d.33,38 Moreover, since these dopants are not covalently bound to the HTM, they can cause ion diffusion under the electric field, which reduces the PCE and stability of PSCs.39 Besides, Spiro-OMeTAD is very expensive (∼$780 g−1 from Sigma) because of multistep synthesis and purification. Therefore, Spiro-OMeTAD is not an ideal HTM for the large-scale fabrication of PSCs.

PTAA presents an optical bandgap of 2.9 eV, and HOMO/LUMO energy levels of −5.2 eV/−2.2 eV, respectively.40 Pristine PTAA displays relatively low hole mobility (∼4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and conductivity (∼6 × 10−7 S cm−1),40,41 which is attributed to the propeller structured triphenylamine. Although PTAA possesses a hydrophobic surface, high-quality perovskite films can still be formed on the surface of PTAA via the solution methods.42 The doped PTAA was first employed as an HTM for inverted p–i–n-type PSCs with a PCE of 18.3% by Huang's group.42 After optimizing the devices, a record PCE of 25.0% was obtained by Zhu's group.31 Lewis acid tetrafluoro-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4-TCNQ) is the most popular dopant in PTAA,43,44 which can cause a significant drop in the resistance of the PTAA films because of an obviously enhanced conductivity (∼10−5 S cm−1).45 Besides, F4-TCNQ may have a passivating effect on the perovskite layer.46 In particular, doped PTAA can be also successfully used in n–i–p type PSCs, often using t-BP and LiTFSI as the dopants.47 The doping mechanisms are similar to those of doped Spiro-OMeTAD.33 To date, a record PCE of 22.1% on the device has already been achieved.48 However, the cost of PTAA is extremely high (∼$2,700 g−1 from Sigma), making it unviable for the large-scale production of PSCs.
Doped HTMs have a few drawbacks in terms of commercialization, including high production costs and poor long-term stability of PSCs. Thus, dopant-free HTMs have become one of the hottest topics in PSCs, and many well discussed reviews have been published before 2020.57–65 However, over 200 papers on dopant-free HTMs for PSCs have been published since 2020 (from SciFinder Search). Herein, our focus is on reviewing dopant-free HTMs for high-performance PSCs from 2020 to now. The champion PCEs of dopant-free HTM-based PSC devices in the corresponding year are summarized in Fig. 2(b). In this review, HTMs are classified based on the different perovskite materials, which is different from the previous reviews that categorized the HTMs according to their molecular structures or device architectures.62,64 The brief discussion and summary of the design principles and development of dopant-free HTMs are presented. Finally, we provide conclusions and perspectives on the molecular design and device application.
2. Perovskite materials
2.1. Methylammonium lead halide
Kojima and co-workers first applied methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3 or MAPbI3) and methylammonium lead bromide (CH3NH3PbBr3 or MAPbBr3) in liquid electrolyte-based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) as sensitizers and achieved PCEs of 3.8% and 3.1%, respectively.12 Since then, methylammonium lead trihalide (MAPbI3) has received great attention as the most representative perovskite material for PSCs. In 2020, Shashank and co-workers reported an excellent PCE of 23.1% with a device configuration of ITO/NiOx/MAPb(I1−xClx)3/PCBM/bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag,66 which is the highest PCE among the methylammonium lead halide-based PSCs reported so far, while still behind its Shockley–Queisser limit efficiency.67 Chemical structures of dopant-free HTMs for the methylammonium lead halide-based PSCs are shown in Fig. 3, and their corresponding properties are summarized in Table 1.

2.1.1 Conventional (n–i–p) PSCs. 
Conventional n–i–p architectures (including mesoporous and planar n–i–p) have been most widely used in PSCs, and the corresponding devices have given the record efficiency.68,69 Liu's group designed a potential 4,4′-dimethoxy-triphenylamine (MeO–TPA)-based HTM (CQ2) with a conjugated π-bridge group of dibenzo[b,d]thiophene by using density-functional theory (DFT) in combination with Marcus theory and successfully synthesized it.70 The CQ-2-based planar n–i–p PSCs produced a PCE of 15.2%, whereas the reference dopant-free HTM X25-based device gave a PCE of 14.3% because of its reduced Jsc and FF. The results revealed that the experimental data they used in this work can reproduce the theoretical results well. Therefore, this work could develop a reliable computational model for screening ideal HTMs for PSCs.
Cao and co-workers successfully designed and synthesized three D–A–D-type dopant-free HTMs (DTBF, DTBT, and DTBS) with MeO–TPA as an electron-donating segment and fused dithieno[3′,2′:3,4;2′′,3′′:5,6]benzo[1,2-c][1,2,5]-chalcogenadiazole (DTBX, X = O, S, and Se) as an electron-deficient unit for application in planar n–i–p PSCs.71 The dopant-free DTBS-based device displayed an obviously higher PCE of 15.0% than the DTBF and DTBT-based devices (PCEs: 13.3% and 11.6%, respectively), which is due to the greater FF. Moreover, the DTBS-based planar n–i–p PSCs exhibited a PCE with 77.8% retention without encapsulation in ambient air with an RH of 50% for 720 h, while the doped Spiro-OMeTAD based PSCs only kept 43.6% of the initial PCE under identical working conditions. The enhanced stability is ascribed to the superior hydrophobicity of DTBS. This report showed that selenium-containing DTBS attained increased intermolecular interaction due to the larger atomic radius of selenium than that of oxygen and sulfur, which was beneficial for charge extraction and transport. A new D–A–D type HTM (TPA–BPFN–TPA) based on an electron-deficient biphenylfumaronitrile (BPFN) unit as the core and the well-known MeO–TPA as the end-cappers was developed by Sonar and Jain et al.72 The dopant-free TPA–BPFN–TPA based mesoporous n–i–p PSCs give an excellent PCE of 18.4%, which is the record efficiency to date among D–A–D-type dopant-free HTMs. Meanwhile, the undoped TPA–BPFN–TPA-based device displayed a record PCE of 30.0% at 1000 lux illumination. Moreover, the stability of unencapsulated TPA–BPFN–TPA-based devices showed an obvious improvement over that of the Spiro-OMeTAD-based device at a harsh relative humidity of 70%. After this, two novel D–A–D′–A–D type small molecules, utilizing dithieno [3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) as the donor π-bridge, thieno [3,4-c] pyrrole-4,6 (5H)-done as the acceptor unit and benzo[b]thiophenes as the donor unit, denoted as BTDTP and BTBDT, were developed by Mitty and Pola et al.73 The BTBDT and BTDTP were used as HTMs without any dopants, which resulted in 16.9% and 17.6% of PCE being accomplished, respectively. By contrast, the doped Spiro-OMeTAD-based PSCs only showed 13.1% efficiency under the same fabrication method. Encouragingly, the total costs of BTDTP and BTBDT were $88 and $80 g−1, respectively, which was only approximately a sixth of that of the Spiro-OMeTAD. As we know, these are very rare HTMs that do not use a TPA unit as the end-capper for PSCs.
Recently, Li and coworkers functionalized the fuoranthene core with MeO–TPA as the end cappers to form new D–π–D type small molecule HTMs, namely FBA1, FBA2 and FBA3.74 The connection method between MeO–TPA and the fluoranthene core (single bond vs. ethylene) as well as the substitution positions of the methoxy groups in the TPA units (para- vs. meta-) were tuned. As a result, an optimized molecule FBA3 with a low synthesis cost of $14 g−1, was applied to a planar n–i–p PSC showing an impressive PCE of 19.2%, representing one of the best cost-effective dopant-free organic HTMs. Furthermore, over 90% of the initial PCEs could be retained for all the dopant-free devices under simulated sunlight for 500 h in a nitrogen atmosphere, while the PCE of the doped Spiro-OMeTAD device decayed to 75% of its initial value. The results demonstrated that adopting ethylene as the connecting π-bridge can effectively increase the mobilities of the derived HTMs due to enhanced π–π interactions, and meta-methoxy substituted TPA can be used as an effective molecule design strategy to down-shift the HOMO levels and enhance the hole mobilities of the derived HTMs.
Besides linear structure HTMs, star-shaped structure HTMs were also successfully developed.75–77 Lin and co-authors reported two novel star-shaped small molecule HTMs, denoted as T-CPDT and C-CPDT, based on a central cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT) core as its large π-conjugation rigid structure benefits charge transport.78 The mesoporous n–i–p device fabricated using C-CPDT as HTM without any dopants achieved an excellent PCE of 19.6%, which is significantly higher than that of the device based on T-CPDT (PCE = 11.4%). This is attributed to its enhanced hole transportation ability caused by introducing the planar carbazole group. Compared with the doped Spiro-OMeTAD-based device, the devices fabricated with dopant-free HTMs showed enhanced long-term stability because of their hydrophobic nature. In 2022, a higher PCE of 20.1% was achieved by Frolova's group.79 They developed a series of D–π–A type star-shaped small molecules (TAT–2T–DCV, TAT–2T–CNA and TPA–3T–DCV) by utilizing triazatruxene and triphenylamine as the central cores (D), 2,2′-bithiophene or 2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene as π-bridge segments, and alkyl dicyanovinyl or alkyl cyanoacetate as A units as dopant-free HTMs for planar n–i–p PSCs. The device fabricated with TAT–2T–CAN exhibited the best PCE of 20.1% with a negligible hysteresis, along with an excellent light stability. The superior PCE of the TAT–2T–CNA-based device was attributed to the highest hole mobility and the lowest film roughness of the TAT–2T–CNA layer. More importantly, there was no void or pinhole in the TAT–2T–CAN layer exposing the perovskite on the surface, thereby forming defectless film morphology. To date, this is a record efficiency in the MAPbI3-based PSCs based on dopant-free star-shaped HTMs.
Apart from dopant-free small molecule HTMs for MAPbI3 devices, it was found that some notable polymeric HTMs were used for PSCs without doping due to their high intrinsic conductivity.80 Gao and co-workers reported three benzodithiophene (BDT)-based copolymers and applied them to planar n–i–p PSCs devices.81 The best device fabricated with the dopant-free PBDT[2F]T showed a decent PCE of 17.5%, significantly higher than those of the other two copolymers. This enhanced performance is ascribed to the higher hole mobility, favorable orientation, and better morphology of PBDT[2F]T. Later on, Sun's group constructed a new class of phenanthrocarbazole (PC)-based polymeric D–π–A–π type HTMs (PC1, PC2, and PC3) by inserting a PC unit into a polymeric thiophene or selenophene chain to enhance the π–π stacking of adjacent polymer chains.82 As a result, a mesoporous n–i–p PSC containing PC3 as a dopant-free HTM achieved an impressive PCE of 20.8%, whereas the PC1 and PC2-based devices only gave PCEs of 8.8% and 18.3%, respectively. The introduction of the selenium atom can passivate surface trap sites of perovskite films by Pb–Se interaction and facilitate the interfacial charge separation effectively, as shown in Fig. 4(a–c), resulting in a much higher PCE. More importantly, the unencapsulated PC3-based PSCs maintained a nearly unaltered PCE after 1000 h in ambient air with an RH of 30–60%; however, the doped Spiro-OMeTAD-based device could only retain 50% of its initial efficiency. Although the synthesis costs of PC3 and Spiro-OMeTAD are similar, the cost of 1 mL precursor of PC3 was significantly lower than that of Spiro-OMeTAD ($0.10 vs. $1.70 g−1), showing great potential for commercial application. Very recently, Chen and co-workers reported that a new class of distinctive dopant-free polymeric HTMs were explored by incorporating a two-dimensionally fluoro-substituted pyrene into thiophene and selenophene repeat conjugated chains, namely PE7, PE8, PE9 and PE10.83 The large rigid planar pyrene and specific Pb–Se secondary interaction not only enhanced charge transport in the HTM layer, but also improved charge transfer and passivation at the perovskite/HTM interface. More importantly, fluorine substitution at the pyrene-neighboring position obviously boosted molecular stacking leading to a more favorable face-on orientation, thereby facilitating efficient charge transport. Consequently, a MAPbI3-based planar PSC based on dopant-free PE10 exhibited an optimal PCE of 21.0% with a high FF of 80.1%, which is a champion efficiency in dopant-free polymeric HTM-based PSCs with MAPbI3. Meanwhile, when using FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 as a perovskite layer instead of MAPbI3, the PCE improved to 22.3% because of the enhanced Jsc and FF. Notably, the unencapsulated device possessed excellent long-term stabilities under thermal and continuous illuminated conditions with an RH of 45–85%.

2.1.2 Inverted (p–i–n) PSCs. 
Compared to conventional n–i–p layouts, inverted p–i–n architectures have some advantages, for example easy fabrication, suppressed hysteresis effect, and thin thickness of HTMs.86,87 Feng and co-workers demonstrated the thienoacene-based small molecule, 2,9-diphenyldinaphtho[2,3-b:2′,3′-f]thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (DPh–DNTT), as an effective HTM without any dopants in inverted PSCs.88 They found that face-on molecular orientation can be achieved by controlling the substrate temperature during the vacuum evaporation process, as shown in Fig. 5. The DPh–DNTT film deposited at room temperature (RT-DPh) with dominant face-on orientation not only exhibited an extremely high out-of-plane mobility of 3.3 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, outperforming the HTMs reported so far, but also possessed a deep HOMO energy level. As a consequence, the device fabricated with RT-DPh showed an impressive PCE of 20.2% with a negligible hysteresis for the inverted MAPbI3-based PSCs and retained 90% of its original efficiency after storing in ambient air with an RH of 60% without encapsulation for 1000 h. The excellent stability was attributed to the hydrophobicity of DPh–DNTT and the strong Pb–S coordination between DPh–DNTT and the perovskite layer. In addition, DPh–DNTT not only exhibited a remarkable performance as a dopant-free HTM, but also had a low synthesis cost of $50 g−1, which is significantly lower than that of Spiro-OMeTAD ($91 g−1).

Xue et al. developed two D–π–A–π–A–π–D structure HTMs (YJ01 and YJ02) based on the 1,4-di((E)-styryl)benzene central core with cyano substitution.89 Compared with YJ02, the enlargement of the substitution distance between the two cyan units gave a much greater reduction of solid-state fluorescence emission for YJ01. As a result, the dopant-free YJ01-based PSC displayed a higher PCE of 19.8% than the device employing YJ02 as the HTM (PCE = 17.5%), which was attributed to the improved Voc and FF. Furthermore, both YJ01 and YJ02-based devices exhibited moderate stability by retaining around 80% and 70% of their initial efficiency after 500 h in ambient air with an RH of 30%. This article reported a strategy in which we could utilize the fluorescence properties of the central core to improve the performance of devices.
The fluorine substitution strategy is widely used to optimize the molecular structures in order to improve their device performance, such as organic photovoltaics (OPVs), organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), and perovskite solar cells.30,90–93 In 2020, Li and co-authors developed a fluorine–methoxytriphenylamin-based small molecule H2 and successfully employed it as a dopant-free HTM in an inverted PSC.94 Compared with the non-fluorine substituted H0, H2 is found to improve energy level alignment, hole extraction, and film morphology, which helped to create a better contact at the HTM/perovskite layer and high-quality perovskite layer. Consequently, the dopant-free H2-based inverted PSC achieved an excellent PCE of 18.6% with a negligible hysteresis and good ambient stability, while the H0-based device only showed a PCE of 13.3%. Later on, Zhang and Zhou et al. developed two small molecules of dopant-free HTMs based on 2,2′-bithiophene abbreviated as BT-MTP and DFBT-MTP.95 In comparison with BT-MTP, fluorinated DFBT-MTP showed a more backbone planarity benefiting for hole-transport mobility, and declining HOMO energy level. Moreover, fluorinated DFBT-MTP displayed a more powerful defect passivation ability indicating that fluorine atoms can also act as a strong Lewis base anchor. Consequently, after employing two small molecules as dopant-free HTMs in inverted PSCs, the device based on DFBT-MTP exhibited a much higher PCE of 20.1%, a 35% efficiency increase than the non-fluorinated BT-MTP-based device. To further extend its π-conjugation, they developed an HTM (DFBT–PMTP) using MeO–TPA as end-cappers and applied it in inverted PSCs.84 The PCE of the device reached up to 21.2%, with a high Voc of 1.17 V and an impressive FF of 82.2%, which is the highest value for the dopant-free HTMs being applied in methylammonium lead halide-based PSCs so far. More importantly, the device based on DFBT–PMTP maintained 92% of its initial PCE over 1000 h in a nitrogen atmosphere, compared with 70% for the well-known PTAA-based ones, as shown in Fig. 4(d and e).
Li's group demonstrated that the introduction of sulfur atoms could passivate the defects of perovskite film by forming a coordination bond of Pb–S.85 In this work, a dopant-free HTM (DBTMT) was prepared by using Buchwald–Hartwig reaction which contains dibenzo[b,d]thiophene as the core unit and bis(4-(methylthio)phenyl)amine as the end groups. By optimizing the DBTMT concentration and annealing conditions, a champion PCE of 21.1% was obtained with an extremely high FF of 83.2% owing to the defect passivation effect. According to the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern and the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements, as shown in Fig. 4(f and g), the passivation effect was beneficial to improve crystallinity and increase the Pb:I ratio, resulting in a high FF and PCE. The DBTMT-based device also exhibited a long-term stability with 96% retention after 600 h in a nitrogen atmosphere. Surprisingly, the synthesis cost of DBTMT was estimated to be $47 g−1, which is much cheaper than that of PTAA ($423 g−1). Similar to the DBTMT molecule, DBFMT with a low cost of $35 g−1 was prepared by replacing the core unit from dibenzo[b,d]thiophene to dibenzo [b,d]furan.96 The inverted device using DBFMT as a dopant-free HTM displayed an excellent PCE of 20.5% and retained over 93% of its initial efficiency after 400 h in a nitrogen atmosphere.
In 2020, a star-shaped D–A typed HTM (D106) based on 2,4,6-triarylpyridine building block was reported by Xue and co-workers.97 Compared with the references HTMs (D104 and D105, D106) exhibited a higher hole mobility, a better solubility, and a higher hydrophobicity, favoring charge transport and low carrier recombination. As a result, the inverted device employing D106 as a dopant-free HTM achieved a high PCE of 18.2% with an ignorable hysteresis and afforded over 75% retention after 275 h in ambient air with an RH of 30%. In particular, the synthesis cost of D106 was as low as $5.6 g−1 because pyridine is a cheap industrial material. On the other hand, a few notable polymeric HTMs were successfully developed. Hao and Li et al. reported two D–A1-D–A2 type polymeric HTMs, PTPDTBT and PDPPTBT, comprising of the benzothiadiazole (BT) unit (A1), thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) or diketopyrrolopyrole-flanked alkyl-thiophene (DPP) moieties (A2) and thiophene unit (D) as dopant-free HTMs in the inverted PSCs.98 The PDPPTBT-based device exhibited an excellent PCE of 18.1%, which was higher than that of the PTPDTBT-based device (16.4%) and significantly exceeded the 12.6% efficiency of the well-known PEDOT:SS-based device. More importantly, the PDPPTBT-based device maintained 71% of its initial PCE after 500 h in ambient air with an RH of 60%, while the PCE of the PEDOT:PSS-based device decayed to zero after 100 h.

2.2 Mixed cation lead halide
During the development of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, there is an ongoing search for other cation materials such as formamidinium (FA+) and cesium (Cs+) to replace methylammonium (MA+) in the A unit due to its instability and larger band-gap than the suitable band-gap calculated from the Shockley–Queisser limit for solar cells.99,100 Theoretically, using FA+ as an A site cation in the ABX3 structure can reduce the band-gap and improve its stability due to its larger ionic radius making a higher symmetry structure of perovskites.101 Cui's group firstly synthesized FAPbI3 for mesoscopic PSCs with a band-gap of 1.43 eV close to a single-junction optimum, thereby a high PCE of 7.5% was achieved.102 However, this perovskite is poor in thermal stability as a result of the organic cation part interacting with the surrounding BX64− octahedra through weak hydrogen bonding.103 It was found that there are both photoactive cubic α-phase and photovoltaically inactive hexagonal δ-phase in FAPbI3 at room temperature.104 Moreover, FAPbI3 perovskite undergoes a phase transition from cubic to hexagonal at a temperature below 390 K. It is believed that if the yellow FAPbI3 polymorph (δ-phase) is entirely eliminated, device performance will be significantly enhanced. Although there are also other organic or inorganic monovalent cations used for the replacement of the MA cation such as ethylammonium (EA+), Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, etc., pure single cations are limited for application in PSCs due to their thermal or structural instability.105–109 To make the combination of the strong characteristics of each individual, mixed cation perovskites have attracted great attention in PSCs.110,111 In 2014, Grätzel et al. developed the first mixed cation perovskite of composition MA0.6FA0.4PbI3 as a light-harvesting layer for solar cells.110 The addition of MA into FAPbI3 both maintained the stability of the α-phase structure and made a red-shift absorption spectrum yielding a PCE of 14.9% much higher than that of the single cation analogues. In this section, we will carefully introduce dopant-free HTMs applied for Cs/FA, MA/FA and Cs/MA/FA mixed PSCs in the past two years. Chemical structures of dopant-free HTMs for the mixed cation lead halide-based PSCs are shown in Fig. 6, and their corresponding properties are summarized in Table 2.

2.2.1 Conventional (n–i–p) PSCs. 
A facile and low-cost synthetic small molecule HTM (SFDT-TDM) based on spirofluorene–dithiolane was reported by Zhu and co-authors.112 Compared with the common spirobifluorene core, the spirofluorene–dithiolane center exhibited a less steric hindrance but still inherited the rigid structural properties from the spirobifluorene core. The intermolecular interactions (C–H⋯π) in adjacent SFDT-TDM were beneficial for high hole mobility and the methylthio-groups could act as Lewis bases to passivate the defects on the surface of the perovskite layers, resulting in suppressed non-radiative recombination and enhanced charge extraction at the perovskite/HTM interface. As a result, the CsFAPbI3-based planar n–i–p PSCs with dopant-free SFDT-TDM as an HTM achieved a remarkable PCE of 21.7% and 20.3% for active areas of 0.04 and 1.0 cm2 along with excellent stability, respectively. Meanwhile, the CsPbIxBr3−x based all-inorganic PSC with SFDT-TDM exhibited a superior PCE of 17.1%, which is the highest one among the dopant-free HTM-based all-inorganic devices. Remarkably, the synthesis cost of SFDT-TDM was estimated to be $12 g−1, which is much lower than the commercial price of Spiro-OMeTAD. In 2020, Loo's group reported a facile design concept to functionalize small molecules so that they can both effectively transport holes and passivate perovskite surface defects.113 To support this concept, they designed and synthesized two small molecules with MeO–TPA as end-cappers, and phenanthrene (YZ18) or 1,10-phenanthroline (YZ22) as the π-conjugated central unit, and evaluated them as HTM alternatives to Spiro-OMeTAD for mesoporous n–i–p PSCs. Both HTMs exhibited similar HOMO energy levels and hole mobilities; however, the outcome efficiency was surprisingly different. The CsFAPbI3-based device with dopant-free YZ22 exhibited a champion PCE of 22.4%, while the YZ-18 based device only displayed a moderate efficiency of 18.1%. XPS revealed interfacial coordination between under-coordinated Pd2+ at the CsFAPbI3 surface with YZ22, as shown in Fig. 7. Consequently, effective passivation of surface defects and enhanced interfacial hole extraction could be observed in the YZ22-based device, resulting in a significant increase in efficiency. Furthermore, the encapsulated device with YZ22 retained 80% of its initial PCE after 1000 h under continuous 1.1 sun illumination in ambient air, while the device with YZ18 only retained 65% of its initial PCE. Encouragingly, the synthesis and purification of YZ18 and YZ22 were simple and easy for large-scale production.

An outstanding efficiency of 23.5% was reported by Cheng's group with the configuration of FTO/TiO2/MAFAPbI3:CZ–Py/CZ–As/Au, as shown in Fig. 8(a–f).55 The pyridine-substituted CZ–Py possessed a deeper HOMO and more effective passivation of the Pb2+ defect (C–N⋯Pb coordination bond), while the p-methoxyphenyl-substituted CZ–As exhibited a significantly higher hole mobility and conductivity. As a result, the CZ–As-based device without any dopants exhibited a high PCEs of 20.9%, which is higher than that of the CZ–Py-based device (PCE = 18.2%). By combining CZ–Py as an additive in an antisolvent and CZ–As as a dopant-free HTM, the hole transport capability was improved and the boundary and surface defects of perovskite layer were well suppressed, facilitating the restriction of non-radiative recombination loss. Consequently, the optimized PSC exhibited a champion PCE of 23.5% with a negligible hysteresis and an excellent long-term stability, retaining over 95% of its original efficiency after 1000 h of aging in with an RH of 50–60%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest PCE in the dopant-free HTM-based PSCs to date. Moreover, the synthesis costs for CZ–Py and CZ–As were as low as $16 g−1 and $10 g−1, respectively, which are much cheaper than the commercialized Spiro-OMeTAD.

A large rigid π-conjugated system can enhance intermolecular π–π interaction, leading to high charge transport capability.115,116 In 2021, Yang's group synthesized an efficient carbazole-based dopant-free HTM via a facile FeCl3 catalysis ring-closing reaction for the first time.117 Compared with C301, the hole mobility of C302 increased from 5.7 × 10−5 to 5.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 owing to an improved π-conjugated degree. Interestingly, the cost of C302 only increased by 20% compared to that of C301 (cost: $172 vs. $208 g−1), while the efficiency of the dopant-free C302-based mesoporous PSCs with MAFAPbIxBr3−x nearly doubled (PCE: 16.4% vs. 5.8%). Later on, Liu's group reported two novel D–π–D typed HTMs, namely ZT-H1 and ZT-H2, with unfused and fused core units and MeO–TPA as end-cappers.114 The fused ZT-H2 had a rigid planar geometry that enhanced the intermolecular π–π interaction, causing nearly one order of magnitude higher hole mobility compared to that of ZT-H1. Consequently, the dopant-free ZT-H2-based planar PSC exhibited a high PCE of 19.6%, which is significantly higher than that of the ZT-H1-based device (PCE = 10.6%). More importantly, the ZT-H2-based device showed obviously enhanced long-term stability compared with the devices using ZT-H1 or doped Spiro-OMeTAD as HTMs, as shown in Fig. 8(g and h). After this, Wu's group gave an example that supported this strategy of molecular design again. D–A–D type HTMs TQ3 and TQ4 have been constructed based on rotatable and chemically fixed thienyl substitutes on the pyrazine ring, respectively.118 Compared with TQ3, the coplanar π-extended TQ4 possessed stronger intermolecular π–π interactions, thereby achieving a significantly higher hole mobility of 2.08 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. As a result, a planar PSC based on dopant-free TQ4 yielded an impressive PCE of 21.0%, whereas the TQ-3-based device only showed a PCE of 10.8%. Notably, dopant-free TQ3- and TQ4-based PSCs retained over 90% of their initial PCEs after 1000 h of storage in ambient air with an RH of 35%, while the doped Spiro-OMeTAD based device had almost a 50% efficiency decrease under identical conditions. Therefore, the extension of π-conjugation is an effective strategy for the rational design of dopant-free HTMs toward efficient and stable PSCs.
Combining the advantages of D–A–D and D–π–D type molecules, Yip and co-workers constructed a D–A–π–A–D type HTM (DTB-FL) with the easy tuning of the energy levels and extended π-conjugation length for improving the charge transport capability.119 Based on this strategy, a low-cost DTB-FL ($12 g−1) was designed and synthesized by utilizing MeO–TPA, benzothiadiazole (BT) and fluorine (FL) moieties as the donor, acceptor and π-bridge, respectively. A D–A–D type HTM (DT-BT) was used as a reference compound. Compared with DT-BT, DTB-FL showed a significantly higher hole mobility of two orders of magnitude and a deeper HOMO energy level of 0.15 eV. Furthermore, the presence of BT units in DTB-FL endowed it as a nice Lewis base for surface passivation of the under-coordinated Pb2+ on the perovskite surface. Consequently, the CsFAPbI3-based planar n–i–p PSCs fabricated with the dopant-free DTB-FL displayed excellent PCEs of 21.5% and 19.6% for active areas of 0.09 and 1.0 cm2, respectively, which are significantly higher than that of the DT-BT device (PCE = 7.3%). However, the doped Spiro-OMeTAD based device gave 19.4% efficiency under similar conditions.
In addition to D–A–π–A–D type HTMs, D–π–A–π–D type HTMs were also successfully developed.120 In 2021, Cheng's group developed a D–π–A–π–D type HTM (tpa-t-FBTD) based on fluorine substituted benzothiadiazole as the acceptor.121 When using dopant-free tpa-t-FBTD as the HTM in a (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 planar PSC, the device displayed a PCE of 18.9% with almost no hysteresis and showed better long-term stability than the device with the doped Spiro-OMeTAD. Notably, the cost of tpa-t-FBTD was only $11 g−1 because of a facile synthesis route. Recently, a large conjugated electron-deficient 12,13-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro[1,2,5]thiadiazole[3,4-e]thieno[2′′,3′′:4,5]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]indole (BTP) unit was successfully used to construct non-fullerene acceptors for high performance organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells.63,122 With the help of these new acceptors, great progress was made in PCEs based on Y6 and its derivatives which exceeded over 19% in single-junction OPV.123,124 Very recently, by utilizing BTP as a central unit, thiophene as a π-bridge, and MeO–TPA as end-cappers, a D–π–A–π–D type Y-T and D–A–D type Y6-T were constructed by Li and Yin et al.125 Compared with Y6-T, the conjugated length of Y-T was further extended by inserting a thiophene bridge between the BTP core and the TPA unit, resulting in enhanced hole transport capability and reduced recombination loss. A MAFAPbI3-based planar PSC fabricated with dopant-free Y-T delivered an impressive PCE of 20.2% with a negligible hysteresis, which is higher than that of the dopant-free Y6-T (PCE = 18.8%) and the doped Spiro-OMeTAD (PCE = 19.2%). Furthermore, the Y-T device retained over 90% of its original efficiency after storing in ambient air with an RH of 30% for 1,440 h due to the intrinsic hydrophobicity; however, the doped Spiro-OMeTAD devices lost almost 95% of their initial efficiency.
Apart from the linear structured HTMs, the HTMs of non-linear structure have also received great attention.126 Two simple star-shaped 1,4-dithiafulvenes (DTF)-functionalized triphenylamine (TPA) molecules with two- and three-armed DTF units, namely WH-2 and WH-3, were designed and synthesized by Jia and Wan et al.127 Compared with the two-armed WH-2, the three armed WH-3 showed an obviously higher hole mobility (2.1 × 10−3vs. 4.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1s−1) and smoother film. Consequently, the CsMAFAPbIxBr3−x-based mesoporous PSCs using WH-2 and WH-3 as dopant-free HTMs achieved PCEs of 15.2% and 19.2%, respectively. After storage in ambient air with an RH of 50–70% for 2,400 h, the WH-3-based device retained 86% of its original PCE, whereas the WH-2-based device only retained 67% efficiency, which is attributed to the better hydrophobicity of WH-3. Later on, Grätzel and co-workers chose MeO–TPA as arms to build a low-cost star-shaped HTM (MeOTTVT).128 By linking the MeO–TPA arms with the TPA core via carbon–carbon double bonds, MeOTTVT gained an extended π-conjugation and enhanced molecular π–π packing. When fabricated into mesoporous PSCs based on CsMAFAPbIxBr3−x, the dopant-free MeOTTVT-based device obtained an excellent PCE of 21.3% with negligible hysteresis and exhibited high stability under thermal, 1 sun illumination, and humid conditions. Additionally, inspired by the classic Spiro-OMeTAD, Jia and Wang et al. designed a dispiro-based dopant-free HTM, namely WH-1, by replacing the central carbon atom of Spiro-OMeTAD with cyclohexane via a simple and efficient two-step synthetic route.129 WH-1 had a parallel arrangement structure of two fluorene segments, facilitating the improvement of hole mobility and intermolecular electronic coupling. WH-1 was used as a dopant-free HTM in a mesoporous n–i–p PSC, and a high PCE of 19.5% was obtained, which is the first dispiro-based molecule as a dopant-free HTM for PSCs. However, the light stability of the device was not good, retaining 74% efficiency under continuous 1 sun illumination in air for only 70 h.
In addition to small molecule counterparts, polymers also played a key role in PSCs as dopant-free HTMs for PSCs.20,80 In 2019, Yang and coworkers reported that poly[(9,9-dioctyl-fluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-co-(4,4′-(N-(4-secbutylphenyl) diphenylamine)] (TFB) was successfully demonstrated as an ideal HTM, pushing the PCE of MAPbI3-based inverted PSC up to 20.2%.130 Later on, Chen and Bi et al. developed a fully solution-processed scalable heterostructure integrated with a CsFAPbIxCl3−x perovskite with an iodide-rich surface, an ultrathin bridge-jointed graphene oxide (BJ-GO) interlayer, and a dopant-free HTM (TFB) layer.131 This chemical suturing technology effectively suppressed the migration of halide ions into the HTM layer and passivated the defects of Pb2+. Finally, the mesoporous PSC device yielded a high PCE of 21.7% with an area of 0.10 cm2. Surprisingly, the PSC module with an area of 35.80 cm2 exhibited a certified PCE of 15.3%. Moreover, the encapsulated PSC module retained over 91% of its initial efficiency after the damp heat test at 85 °C and an RH of 85% for 1000 h, indicating a high long-term stability. Recently, Jo et al. developed a series of dopant-free HTMs by the partial substitution of conjugated polymer with a TPA unit, namely, TPA0, TPA1, TPA2 and TPA3.132 The introduction of TPA units could not only enhance the interaction and passivation of the HTM/perovskite interface, but also increase the population of face-on orientated crystallites leading to high charge transport abilities. As a consequence, the MAFAPbIxBr3−x-based planar PSC using dopant-free TPA2 as the HTM exhibited the best PCE of 20.4%, which is significantly higher than that of the without TPA-substituted TPA0-based device (PCE = 15.8%). Moreover, an obviously better stability was observed in the TPA2-based device. In 2021, Li and Meng et al. constructed a series of D–A copolymers based on fluorothienyl benzodithiophene (BDTT) and difluoroquinoxaline (DFQ) segments as D and A units, respectively, namely, PBQ5, PBQ6 and PBQ10.133 By introducing alkylfluorothienyl as a side chain of the DFQ segment, the resultant polymer PBQ6 offered the lowest HOMO energy (−5.43 eV) and the best match with the perovskite layer, and the highest hole mobility (4.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) attributed to the best planar structure and the highest degree of crystallinity, leading to an effective charge carrier extraction and transport at the interface. Owing to the faster charge transfer and lowest trap-assisted recombination loss, PBQ6 as a dopant-free HTM in planar PSC based on MAFAPbIxBr3−x achieved a superior PCE up to 22.6% with a very high Voc of 1.13 V and an FF of 80.8%, which is a top-ranking PCE in the n–i–p PSCs based on a dopant-free D–A copolymer HTM. Moreover, the device also exhibited significantly improved ambient, thermal and light stability compared with the doped Spiro-OMeTAD-based device. Encouragingly, a large area device of 1.0 cm2 with an excellent PCE of 21.1% through the blade coating technique was successfully fabricated in ambient air. Very recently, Liu and Chen et al. develop a PM6 analogue, PMSe, which was constructed by utilizing BDT, selenophene, and benzodithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD) as the donor, π-bridge, and acceptor units, respectively.56 After replacing thiophene with selenophene, PMSe exhibited a stronger π–π stacking and a better defect passivation effect. A record efficiency of 24.5% was achieved by blending PMSe in PM6 at a ratio of 1:9 as a dopant-free HTM for n–i–p type PSCs. Besides, the device based on the polymeric alloy (PM6/PMSe) retained 96% of its original PCE after aging in air with an RH of 30 ± 5% for 1,200 h. This result indicated that the polymer alloying strategy was a potential way to design dopant-free HTM for efficient and stable PSCs.
BDD as an electron-withdrawing unit played a key role in constructing high-performance polymeric donors for OPV.134–136 Zhen's group selected BDD as an acceptor unit, thieno[3,2-b]thiophene as a π-bridge, and ladder typed indacenodithiophene (IDT) or indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) as the donor unit to construct two D–A copolymers PBDTT and PBTTT, respectively.137 The CsMAFAPbIxBr3−x-based planar PSC employing a dopant-free polymer as the HTM, the PBDTT-based device exhibited a slightly higher PCE of 20.2% than that of PBTTT (PCE = 19.4%), because the superior solubility of IDT resulted in a smoother film and better interfacial contact. Both the devices showed good stability, retaining 80% of their original PCEs after storage for 720 h in ambient air. Later on, by replacing the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene of the thiophene unit, they developed two novel D–A copolymers PDT-T and PDTT-T.138 Although the PCEs of the devices with dopant-free PDT-T (PCE = 19.0%) and PDTT-T (PCE = 18.6%) were slightly lower than that of the PBDTT-based device, the stability of the devices was significantly enhanced, retaining 80% of their original PCEs after storage for 2,160 h in ambient air. This is attributed to the higher compactness and hydrophobicity of the HTMs. Recently, they adopted BDT derivative units in place of the IDT unit to construct a series of D–A copolymers, namely, PBDB-O, PBDB-T and PBDB-Cz.139 Compared with the alkoxy-substituted PBDB-O and alkylthiophene-substituted PBDB-O, the carbazoly-substituted PBDB-Cz increased both the coplanarity and interaction of polymer chains, leading to the highest hole mobility. Finally, an outstanding PCE of 22.0% has been achieved in the dopant-free PBDB-Cz-based PSC, while the PBDB-O and PBDB-T-based devices only showed PCEs of 10.2% and 19.0%, respectively. Notably, the encapsulated PBDB-Cz-based device exhibited an extremely high long-term stability, retaining more than 90% of its initial efficiency after being stored in ambient air with an RH of 50% for 2,400 h. However, the synthesis cost of PBDB-Cz was up to $313 g−1, which is higher than that of spiro-OMeTAD ($94 g−1).
Noncovalent through-space intramolecular interactions, which are usually defined as noncovalent conformational locks, have been employed as an important strategy to increase the planarity and rigidity of extended π-conjugation.140–143 Promarak's group designed a conjugated polymer IDTB by polymerizing a 2,5-dialkyloxy-1,4-phenylene (OB) monomer and a planar rigid IDT monomer.144 With the help of S–O intramolecular interaction between OB and IDT units, IDTB formed a ladder-like conjugated structure with a flat conformation resulting in high hole mobility, and also effective passivated defects in the perovskite layer. When fabricated PSCs based on CsMAFAPbIxBr3−x, the dopant-free IDTB-based device showed a PCE of 19.3% along with a very low hysteresis and held a superior moisture stability due to its hydrophobic ability. Very recently, a phenanthrocarbazole (PC)-based polymeric HTM (PC6) was successfully developed by Yao and Liu, which possessed a fixed planar molecular geometry via an S–O noncovalent conformational locking, as shown in Fig. 9(a and b).145 The formation of S–O secondary interaction reduced reorganization energies and avoided the undesirable rotation of adjacent building blocks in the polymer facilitating for a closer π–π intermolecular packing, resulting in a higher hole mobility of 8.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Furthermore, the introduction of the O atom acted as “Lewis Soft” able to interact with uncoordinated Pb2+, reducing the trap-state density and suppressing the interfacial charge carrier recombination. Consequently, the dopant-free PC6-based planar PSC exhibited a remarkably PCE of 22.2% and a significantly enhanced long-term stability compared with the PC4-based device.

In order to enhance the interaction and passivation at the perovskite/HTM interface, some functionalized side chains were widely employed to build dopant-free HTMs, such as amino and polyether groups.147 Zhang and co-workers chose a diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as a main building block and tethering primary amines as side chains to build a dopant-free HTM, namely, P5NH.148 P5NH exhibited better aggregation properties and higher hole mobility, and enhanced ability of passivation to the perovskite layer than the classic P3HT. As a result, a planar PSC with P5NH exhibited a moderate PCE of 18.1% along with an extremely high FF of 83.1%. Later on, Li's group reported a series of D–A copolymers, PBDT-Nx (x = 0, 5, 20), also bearing amino pendants as side chains.149 With the increased amino contents, copolymers displayed enhanced hole mobility, closer intermolecular packing, and increased recombination resistance, resulting in the promotion of device efficiency and stability. Therefore, the highest PCE of 18.9% was achieved in the dopant-free PBDT-N20-based mesoporous PSC. Moreover, the unencapsulated device retained over 95% of its original PCE for more than 1000 h under different aging conditions, such as an RH of 85%, heating at 80 °C, and 1 sun illumination. These results revealed that the amino-pended polymer is an effective strategy to develop high-performance dopant-free HTMs with hole transport and defect passivation simultaneously.
On the other hand, a novel D–A copolymer, alkoxy-PTEG, was engineered by combining the BDT unit and tetraethylene glycol (TEG)-substituted 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole.150 The alkoxy-PTEG exhibited high solubility in non-aromatic solvent 3-methylcyclohexanone (3-MC) and yielded 19.9% efficiency in a planar PSC. Moreover, the device processed using non-halogenated 2-methyl anisole (2-MA) exhibited an impressive PCE of up to 21.2% with a good thermal stability, which is higher than that of the one utilizing halogenated chlorobenzene (20.6%). In addition, TEG groups could capture toxic lead ions and prevent their leakage into the environment. Based on this strategy, a higher efficiency of 22.1% was achieved in the PBTFO-based planar PSCs, reported by Park and co-workers.146 This work revealed that a perovskite/HTM graded heterojunction (GHJ) maximizes the passivation effect of these functional groups and immobilizes volatile organic cations by forming Lewis-adducts and hydrogen bonds. Consequently, the PSC device fabricated using the dopant-free PBTFO-based GHJ structure displayed excellent PCEs of 22.1% and 20.0% for active areas of 0.096 and 1.0 cm2 without any hysteresis, respectively, and an extremely high Voc of 1.22 V with a very low voltage loss of 0.37 V, as shown in Fig. 9(c and d). Moreover, the devices exhibited significantly enhanced operational stability under heating, moisture, and light illumination. Last year, Jo and Baek et al. developed a graft-type polymer employing a BDT as the main chain and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as a side chain for dopant-free HTM planar PSCs.151 Among these PEG-grafted polymers, P2 delivered an enhanced hole mobility and a preferred face-on orientation, and reduced trap-state density owing to sufficient defect passivation. As a consequence, the P2-based device exhibited notable PCEs of 21.7% and 38.4% under AM 1.5 solar illumination and 1000 lux LED, respectively. In addition, a series of bifunctional copolymers with different numbers of siloxane-terminated side chains were prepared by Gao and Zhang as dopant-free HTMs in PSCs.152 The introduction of siloxane-terminated side chains endowed the polymers with passivation of Pb2+ defects via the Pb–O interaction and enhanced the hydrophobicity. Furthermore, the hole mobilities gradually enhanced with the increase in the number of siloxane-terminated side chains. As a result, the dopant-free PBZ-3Si-based device exhibited the best PCE of 20.1% with an impressive FF of 84.9%. Moreover, the unencapsulated device presented excellent thermal and moisture stability, retaining 76% of its original efficiency after storage at 85 °C for 333 h in ambient air with an RH of above 70%.
Apart from linear conjugated polymers, Liu's group developed a multifunctional 2D conjugated polymeric HTM, namely 2DP-TDB, which was engineered by utilizing BDT, DPP and 1,3,5-tri(thiophen-2-yl)benzene (TB) units.153 2D polymer 2DP-TDB exhibited efficient charge transportability due to extended π-electron delocalization in two dimensions and the dominant face-on π–π packing orientation (Fig. 10(a)), leading to an obviously higher hole mobility of 2.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 than the 2D small molecule TB-DPP. Moreover, the 2DP-TDB layer not only efficiently passivated the perovskite surface defects but also protected it from moisture invasion. As a result, an extremely high PCE of 21.5% was obtained in planar PSCs employing 2DP-TDB as the HTM without any dopants and retained 95% of its initial efficiency after being stored in ambient air for 1000 h, as shown in Fig. 10(c–i). After further optimizing of the perovskite layer with p-fluorobenzamidine hydrochloride (p-FPhFACl), the 2DP-TDB-based device achieved a remarkable efficiency of 22.1%.

In addition to small molecules and polymers, organometallic compounds could be successfully developed as dopant-free HTMs for PSCs.154,155 Among them, metal phthalocyanines (MPc) have attracted great interest as HTMs for PSCs, owing to their low synthesis cost and excellent stability.156,157 In 2020, Cheng's group reported a methoxy substituted copper(II) phthalocyanine CuPc-(OMe)8 that exhibited comparable hole mobility (1.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) and conductivity properties (1.4 × 10−4 S cm−1) compared with the doped Spiro-OMeTAD.158 This was applied in a planar PSC; the dopant-free CuPc-(OMe)8-based device yielded a high PCE of 18.3% with a low hysteresis, comparable with the doped Spiro-OMeTA-based device (PCE = 18.7%). More importantly, the device with dopant-free CuPc-(OMe)8 exhibited a significantly higher stability than that of the doped Spiro-OMeTA-based device in ambient air with an RH of 40–50%. Amazingly, a champion PCE of over 21% was achieved in dopant-free MPc-based planar PSCs.159 A series of four methoxyethoxy substituted MPcs, namely CoPc, NiPc, CuPc, ZnPc and H2Pc, with different central atoms were developed by Gao's group very recently. The two oxygen atoms in the methoxyethoxy substituent could enhance the molecular dipole, and the central nickel atom contributed more electrons to the phthalocyanine unit, thereby constructing the intramolecular electric field within NiPc to promote charge transfer. As a result, the NiPc-based PSC exhibited the best PCE of up to 21.2%, which is a record efficiency in PSCs using organometallic compounds as HTMs. Additionally, the NiPc-based device exhibited excellent stabilities, maintaining 90% of its initial efficiency at 85 °C or 1 sun illumination in a nitrogen atmosphere after 1000 h. Therefore, this work offered a new method to boost the charge transport within MPcs, pushing the efficiency of PSCs.


2.2.2 Inverted (p–i–n) PSCs. 
In 2021, Guo and co-workers prepared two D–A–D type linear small molecule HTMs featuring carbonyl group-functionalized arenes as the acceptor units and MeO–TPA groups as the donor units, denoted as TPA-FO and TPA-PDO.160 Compared with one carbonyl group functionalized TPA-FO, TPA-PDO containing two carbonyl groups possessed lower hole mobility, stronger wettability harmful for perovskite crystal growth, and weaker interaction with Pb2+ without the chelation effect.161 As a result, the dopant-free TPA-FO-based PSCs exhibited an excellent PCE of 20.2%, while the device based on TPA-PDO only gave an inferior PCE of 17.0%. Notably, the synthesis costs of TPA-FO and TPA-PDO were as low as $30 and $35 g−1, respectively, which is attributed to the facile one-step Suzuki coupling reaction. Then, by introducing cross-linkable styryl groups into small molecule HTM-1, Xu and co-authors reported two cross-linked small molecules, namely HTM-H and fluorine substituted HTM-F, which linked to 3D networks like polymers in situ at mild temperatures.162,163 In contrast to polymer HTMs with tedious synthesis and purification, cross-linked small molecules are easily prepared and modified. Owing to the 3D network structure, the HTM-H and HTM-F-based devices yielded notable PCEs of 20.5% and 19.0%, while a very poor PCE of 7.5% was observed in the HTM-1-based device. Because of the large electronegativity of fluorine, strong interactions could be formed between HTM, FA and Pd in perovskites, which not only passivated the perovskite film, but also suppressed ion migration in the perovskite film. As a result, the efficiency of the HTM-F device was improved. Furthermore, the HTM-F-based device retained 91% of its initial PCE after heating at 85 °C for 1000 h, whereas the HTM-H-based device only retained 40% of its initial PCE.
By modifying the substitution position of methoxyl-substitutions in the TPA units, two dicyanofluoranthene-based D–A–D-type dopant-free HTMs (BTF5 and BTF6) have been successfully developed for inverted PSCs, as shown in Fig. 11(a–f).164Meta-methoxyl substituted BTF6 exhibited more matched energy levels with perovskites and much enhanced hole mobility in comparison to BTF5 with para-methoxyl substitutions, thereby resulting in significantly distinct efficiencies as dopant-free HTMs in the devices, 20.3% for BTF6 vs. 11.4% for BTF5. More encouragingly, BTF6 was applied in fabricating a dopant-free flexible device and produced a promising PCE of 18.0% with a low hysteresis, which is the record PCE for flexible devices based on small molecule HTMs. Besides, the synthesis costs of BTF5 and BTF6 were as low as around $20 g−1. Notably, after being stored for 500 h in a nitrogen atmosphere under 1 sun illumination, the PCE of the dopant-free BTF6-based device remained unchanged, but the efficiency of the doped PTAA-based device was decreased by 12%. In 2020, a novel dendritic engineering strategy was first utilized to design HTMs with a D–A–D type molecular framework, reported by Guo and co-authors.165 Diphenylamine dendron, carbazole dendron, and diphenylamine/carbazole hybridized dendron were used as the donor segments to afford four D–A–D type dendritic HTMs, namely MPA–PA–BTI, MPA–Cz–BTI, MCz–PA–BTI, and MCz–Cz–BTI. Among them, MPA–Cz–BTI and MCz–Cz–BTI showed better interfacial contact with the perovskite layer and obviously lower charge recombination losses. As a consequence, remarkably high PCEs of 20.8% and 21.3% were achieved for the dopant-free MPA–Cz–BTI and MCz–Cz–BTI-based inverted devices, respectively, which also possessed high long-term stability. Remarkably, ultrahigh FF values of 85.2% and 83.5% were recorded for both devices, which is the highest reported value in the dopant-free HTM-based PSCs.

Intramolecular noncovalent interaction is a powerful strategy for constructing dopant-free HTMs for high-performance inverted PSCs.167 Guo and Gao et al. synthesized three small molecules comprising bithiophene-bridged triphenylamine moieties: BTORA and BTORCNA with S–O noncovalent interactions and BTRA without S–O interaction.168 With the help of S–O interaction, the torsion angle between two thiophenes of BTORA and BTORCNA largely reduced in comparison with that of BTRA, indicating that they had a highly planar confirmation, as shown in Fig. 12(a and b). Cyano group was introduced in BTORCNA to decrease the HOMO energy level and act as a Lewis base passivating the surface defects in perovskite films. As a result, the dopant-free BTRA-based device yielded a moderate PCE of 18.40%, while the BTORA-based device exhibited a higher efficiency of 20.2%. With the further attachment of CN groups to BTORCN, the device showed a champion PCE of 21.1% and the best thermal stability. Encouragingly, the estimated material cost of BTORCNA ($58 g−1) was much lower than that of the Spiro-OMeTAD ($91 g−1) and PTAA ($423 g−1). On the other hand, intermolecular non-covalent interactions were also successfully used by Zhang's group.169 They investigated the effect of introducing the hydrogen bonding system (NH⋯CO) into the HTM layer for inverted PSCs. A D–A–D type molecule TPADPP–Boc with a low cost of $12 g−1 consisting of the tert-butoxylcarbonyl (t-Boc)-substituted DPP moiety as the acceptor core and MeO–TPA units as an end-capper was developed, which was converted into TPADPP due to the decomposition of the t-Boc unit on heating at 180 °C for 10 min. After the thermal annealing process, hydrogen bonding emerged between amide and the carbonyl unit increasing the hole mobility from 1.1 × 10−4 to 3.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Besides, the N–H units could not only passivate the surface of the perovskite layer for forming a more crystalline perovskite film, but also form Pb–N coordination bonds at the interface between the HTM and the perovskite layer, resulting in significantly improved hole extraction. Consequently, the dopant-free hydrogen-bonded TPADPP based device achieved a remarkable PCE of 21.6%, which was significantly higher than that of the TPADPP–Boc-based device with a PCE of 16.3%. Moreover, the dopant-free TPADPP-based device exhibited high long-term photostability, retaining 87% of its original efficiency after 500 h of continuous 1 sun equivalent illumination. Besides, self-assembly via noncovalent interactions is a very important strategy for constructing long-range order of small molecules and reducing defects.170 Recently, Jen and Cai et al. developed two novel D–π–D type HTMs N01 and N02 employing functionalized phenoxazine (POZ) and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) unit as the donor and the π-linker, respectively, to achieve high performance inverted PSCs.171,172 Single crystal X-ray diffraction demonstrated that N01 self-assembles into an ordered lamellar structure by weak dipole–dipole interactions involving C–H⋯O, C–H⋯Br and π–π interactions, as shown in Fig. 12(c–e). Compared to N02, N01 exhibited an obviously different film absorption, thermal phase transformation and film morphology, as well as superior charge transport and charge extraction. Besides, the Br atom participated in the interaction with Pd2+ reducing the trap-state density in the interface. Consequently, the dopant-free N01-based device showed a notable PCE of 21.8% together with a good long-term stability, which is the highest value for inverted PSCs with dopant-free THMs so far. Additionally, the synthesis cost of N01 was estimated to be $19 g−1, which is significantly lower than that of PTAA.

Besides dopant-free small molecule HTMs for mixed cation perovskite devices, a few polymeric counterparts have been successfully developed and fabricated in the inverted devices. Two novel crossconjugated polymers (PPE1 and PPE2) with two isomeric structures were prepared by Jen and coworkers.166 Although the two materials had similar energy levels, optical properties, hole mobility and surface wettability, the performance of PPE1 and PPE2-based devices was dramatically distinct. A much higher PCE of 19.3% was obtained in the dopant-free PPE2-based device than that of the PPE1 device (PCE = 11.1%), because PPE2 was found to improve the quality of perovskite films cast on top with larger grain sizes and more oriented crystallization, as shown in Fig. 11(g and h). After taking phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) to passivate the defects of perovskites, the PCE of a PPE2-based device further enhanced up to 21.3% because of its increased Voc. Moreover, a much higher synthesis cost of $65 g−1 was calculated for PPE1, while that of PPE2 is only $20 g−1 due to the scaled starting materials. In the same year, Fang and Zhang et al. reported two copolymers PFDT–COOH and fluorinated PFDT–2F–COOH by combining fluorene units with carboxyl side chains and bithiophene units as dopant-free HTMs for inverted PSCs.173 The dopant-free PFDT–2F–COOH-based device exhibited a higher PCE of 21.6% than the PFDT–COOH-based device (PCE = 20.6%). The enhanced efficiency was mainly attributed to the elevated Voc via the fluorination strategy. Both the devices retained over 80% of their original PCE values under heating at 85 °C for 720 h in a nitrogen atmosphere, indicating that they possessed good thermal stability. After this, Zhu and Li et al. successfully reported a new high-performance pyridine-based polymeric HTM (PPY2) by simply modifying the linking sites of a monomeric pyridine unit from 2,6-position (PPY1) to 3,5-position (PPY2).174 The results showed that PPY2 exhibited a more matched HOMO energy level, a much higher hole mobility and a more efficient passivation of the uncoordinated Pb2+ and iodide defects compared to PPY1, thereby reducing the non-radiative recombination processes inside perovskites and at the interface. As a result, the inverted PSC employing PPY2 as a dopant-free HTM exhibited an encouraging PCE of 22.4% with a small Voc loss of 0.40 V, whereas the PPY1-based device only showed a PCE of 15.0%. More importantly, the PPY2-based unencapsulated device displayed an excellent long-term photostability, retaining 97% of its initial PCE after 500 h continuous one sun illumination in a nitrogen atmosphere. In contrast, only 75% of the initial efficiency could be retained for the well-known PTAA-based device under identical conditions. Very recently, a champion PCE of 22.8% was achieved in inverted PSCs with a dopant-free polymeric HTM.175 Chen and co-workers synthesized a novel polymeric HTM (denoted as p-PY) with a lower lab synthesis cost of $72 g−1 by introducing pyridine rings as anchoring groups into the structure of PTAA. Compared to PTAA, p-PY showed a matchable energy level, higher mobility and conductivity, and enhanced defect passivation ability due to the introduction of the pyridine group. In addition, the use of p-PY facilitated the growth of the perovskite film. Therefore, the inverted PSC employing dopant-free p-PY displayed a much higher PCE of 22.8% than the control PTAA-based device of 20.8%, which is attributed to the enhanced Voc and FF. In addition to high efficiency, the use of p-PY simultaneously improved the long-term stability of the device under harsh thermal conditions and continuous illumination, which retained over 81% of its initial PCE at 120 °C after 200 h and over 97% after 1000 h.

2.3. All-inorganic lead halide
Despite the high efficiencies and excellent properties, the intrinsically unstable nature of organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskite materials, particularly to moisture and heat, is still a critical challenge for long-term stability. All-inorganic perovskite materials are known to be more thermal and light stable than their organic–inorganic hybrid counterparts.176–178 As shown in Fig. 13, CsPbX3 has four types of crystal polymorph: the cubic structure (α-phase), the tetragonal structure (β-phase), the orthorhombic structure (γ-phase), and a non-perovskite structure (δ-phase). The room temperature stable phase of CsPbI3 is the non-perovskite δ-yellow phase that is not suitable for PSCs as a photovoltaic material, while the black α-phase is only stable at room temperature under special conditions which are generally employed as a perovskite material.179,180 The initial all-inorganic PSCs were based on CsSnI3, but only showed a PCE of 0.88% in 2012.181 In 2015, Kulbak et al. reported the first CsPbBr3-based PSCs with a PCE up to 5.95% and further demonstrated that the inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite can be thermally stable up to 580 °C, while the organic MAPbBr3 starts losing mass at 220 °C.182,183 Since then, the number of published papers related to all-inorganic PSCs has grown rapidly.184 To date, the record PCE of 21.0% in CsPbI3-based PSCs with the doped Spiro-OMeTAD has been achieved by Meng's group in 2022.185 In contrast, the PCEs of all-inorganic PSCs fabricated using the dopant-free HTMs lag far behind.186 Chemical structures of dopant-free HTMs for the all-inorganic lead halide-based PSCs are shown in Fig. 14, and their corresponding properties are summarized in Table 3.

Zhu and Yip et al. reported a novel 3D small molecule HTM, namely TPE-S, based on a tetraphenylethylene (TPE), and applied it in inverted PSCs as a dopant-free HTM.187 The CsPbI2Br-based inverted PSCs with TPE-S exhibited a remarkable PCE of 15.4% along with excellent stability. The unencapsulated device retained 82% of its initial PCE under the simulated sunlight for 400 h, indicating it possessed an excellent photostability. Meanwhile, the TPE-S could also be generally used to improve the performance of organic/inorganic hybrid inverted PSCs, which exhibited an outstanding PCE of 21.0%. To date, this value is approaching the record PCE achieved in inverted PSCs. The results indicated that the S atoms of TPE-S gave an efficient surface passivation effect by forming coordination bonding with Pb2+ ions, which significantly affected the crystallization of the perovskite layer and effectively suppressed interfacial recombination. Later on, Dai and co-workers successfully developed a star-shaped A–π–D-type small molecule HTM, namely CI–TTIN–2F, employing a triazatruxene (TAT) as the electron-rich segment, alkylated terthiophene as π-bridges, and a fluorinated Lewis base as the electron-deficient unit.188 The CsPbI3-based mesoporous n–i–p PSCs with dopant-free CI–TTIN–2F demonstrated an impressive PCE up to 15.9%, along with 86% efficiency retention after 1000 h in ambient air with an RH 0f 20%. However, the doped Spiro-OMeTAD-based device suffered a sharp drop up to <10% in its initial PCE within only 100 h under identical conditions. This is because CI–TTIN–2F possessed multisite defect-healing effects on the surface of the CsPbI3 film due to the presence of various heteroatoms in the chemical structure, which can effectively reduce the trap densities and charge recombination at the interface, as shown in Fig. 15(a–d). Notably, the largest all-inorganic perovskite solar module was also fabricated that showed a high PCE of 11.0% with an area of 27 cm2.

Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as a classic organic photovoltaic material also plays a critical role in improving the performance of all-inorganic PSCs.190,191 Hu's group reported that dopant-free P3HT-based CsPbI2Br PSCs exhibited a comparable PCE to Spiro-OMeTAD-based devices but much enhanced ambient stability with over 95% PCE after 1300 h by a pre-annealing method, as shown in Fig. 15(e–g).189 This pre-annealing process was developed to achieve high-quality CsPbI2Br films by regulating the nucleation and crystallization of the perovskites. Furthermore, a TFB buffer layer with a deep HOMO energy level was successfully introduced between CsPbI2Br and P3HT layers to bridge the energy level mismatch. As a result, a remarkable PCE of 15.5% for dopant-free P3HT-based CsPbI2Br PSCs was achieved by reducing the Vloss of the devices. Amazingly, the unencapsulated device retained 98% of its initial PCE after aging in ambient air with an RH of below 20% for 1440 h.
Besides the well-known P3HT, other famous polymers were also employed which were widely used in OPV.136,192 A one-source strategy using the same polymer donor material to simultaneously dope CsPbI2Br films via antisolvent engineering and fabricating the HTM was developed by Li's group, as shown in Fig. 16(a).193 Based on this one-source strategy, famous donors, such as PTB7, PBDB-T, PM6, and PM7, were used in mesoporous PSCs. The one-source process could induce perovskite growth with enlarged grain size and reduced defect density, and assembly into a fingerprint-like hole transporting layer which improved the conductivity and electrical contact for hole extraction and transportation. Consequently, the device based on this one-source strategy with PBDB-T exhibited the highest PCE of 16.4% and the best thermal stability. Importantly, the PCEs of the Spiro-OMeTAD-based PSCs dramatically decayed to 30% of their initial values within 160 h under 85 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere, but the one-source PSCs retained 85% of their initial PCEs after 500 h. A polymer PBDB-T-Si was applied in a CsPbI2Br-based planar n–i–p PSC, reported by Wang and co-workers.194 Finally, the device fabricated with dopant-free PBDB-T-Si produced a high PCE of 15.6% with an extremely high FF of 84.0%, which was attributed to the deep HOMO energy level, superior hole mobility, and quasi-Ohmic contact, while the PBDB-T-based reference device gave a PCE of 14.2%. Very recently, Fang and co-workers constructed a brand-new architecture of all-inorganic PSCs via employing J71, PBDB-T, and PM6 as dopant-free HTMs owing to their suitable energy levels and carrier transport abilities.195 As shown in Fig. 16(b–g), the PM6-based device impressively achieved a champion PCE of 17.0%, which is the highest efficiency in the dopant-free polymers-based all-inorganic PSCs. Although these dopant-free polymers-based all-inorganic PSCs achieved excellent efficiencies and long-term stabilities, the cost of these polymers is a great challenge for large-scale application.

3. Conclusions and outlook
Perovskite solar cells have experienced rapid breakthroughs over the past decade, wherein the HTMs play a crucial role in extracting and transporting holes from the perovskite layer to the metal or ITO/FTO electrodes. HTMs have significant influences on both performance and long-term stability.196,197 As we know, almost all of the record PCEs of the devices were fabricated with the dopant HTMs, such as Spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA. The dopants, such as t-BP, LiTFSI, FK209, etc., are hygroscopic, which can accelerate PSC degradation. Additionally, Spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA are expensive which prevents the large-scale fabrication of PSCs. As an alternative, dopant-free HTM-based devices can effectively overcome these problems. However, the PCEs still lag behind the dopant HTM-based devices, as shown in Fig. 17. Herein, great efforts should be made to develop high-performance dopant-free HTMs for low-cost PSCs.

3.1. Efficiency challenges
Since 2020, over 200 papers on dopant-free HTMs for PSCs have been published. Most of the papers focused on organic HTMs because of their abundant materials sources, finely adjustable electronic and optical properties as well as solution-processability in contrast with inorganic HTMs. We carefully reviewed them categorizing by their application on devices with different perovskite compositions in the A-site. When the A-site cation is considered, lead halide perovskite can be divided into three parts: MAPbX3, mixed cation PbX3 and CsPbX3. It is found that the dopant-free HTM PSCs based on mixed cation PbX3 attract the greatest attention because of their high efficiency and long stability. Although A-site cation does not directly contribute to the optical band gap of perovskites, it plays an important role in geometrical structure stability through the interaction with the BX3 octahedra.198 The crystal lattice is contracted or expanded via introducing a smaller or larger size cation in the A-site resulting in a different bandgap.199 The well-known case is that the band-gap decreased from 1.55 eV to 1.47 eV after replacing MA of FA in MAPbI3 perovskites.200 And CsPbI3 possesses an optical band-gap of around 1.73 eV with an absorption edge of 720 nm and produces a maximum current density of about 22 mA cm−2.176 This is the reason why the efficiency of all-inorganic PSCs falls behind the organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs.
To further analyze the efficiency of PSCs, the relationship between Voc and HOMO energy levels of dopant-free HTMs is investigated. As we know, the general belief is that the HOMO energy level should be higher than the valence band maximum (VBM) of perovskite materials, which is beneficial for hole extraction and reducing Voc loss. The Voc values were plotted against the HOMO energy levels of HTMs on different perovskite materials, as shown in Fig. 18(a) and (e). When the Voc of the conventional and inverted PSCs exceeded 1.0 V, almost all the HOMO energy levels are from −5.0 to −5.5 eV, and there is no clear trend. Thereby, we cannot give a clear HOMO energy level of HTMs for the perovskite materials. Notably, the HOMO energy levels can be easily adjusted by introducing electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups into the backbone of molecules. Moreover, suitable energy levels of HTMs can be obtained by constructing different types of molecular backbones like D–A, D–A–D, D–π–A, D–π–A–π–D, etc.

Hole mobility is prior consideration for designing high-efficiency HTMs without dopants. The effects of hole mobility on Jsc, FF and PCE are plotted in Fig. 18(b–d) for the conventional device and Fig. 18(f–h) for the inverted device. There are positive correlations between device performance and hole mobility. For the conventional n–i–p architecture, most of the device exhibits a high FF of over 72% and a PCE of over 18% with a high hole mobility of more than 1.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 which is comparable to doped Spiro-OMeTAD. However, almost all the Jsc of above 22.0 mA cm−2 can be achieved in the low hole mobility of over 2.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. Therefore, the higher hole mobility is more favorable for FF in the conventional device. However, for the inverted p–i–n architecture, we confirmed that almost all the hole mobility of over 2.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 is sufficient to achieve a high efficiency of over 18%. Notably, the relationships between high Jsc/FF and hole mobility are consistent with the PCE. HTMs do not require considerable high hole mobility in inverted devices because the thickness of the HTMs is significantly lower than that of conventional devices, typically 10–20 nm. Many strategies have been proposed to design dopant-free HTMs with higher intrinsic hole mobility. For example, expanding the conjugated length was successfully employed. DTB-FL with an extended conjugation system displayed a higher hole mobility of 3.9 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 resulting in a champion PCE of 21.5%.119 In addition to the extended conjugated length, HTMs with ordered face-on orientation facilitate the π–π intermolecular interaction. With preferred face-on orientation, the DPh–DNTT film deposited at room temperature exhibited a high out-of-plane hole mobility of 3.3 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1.88 In addition, some special atoms may enhance the intermolecular interaction through van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonding and dipole–dipole interactions. In the case of PE10, fluorine substitution at the pyrene-neighboring position boosts the molecular packing with a face-on orientation through fluorine–aromatic (F–π) interaction resulting in a high mobility and PCE of 1.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 22.3%, respectively.83
Developing HTMs with defect passivation ability is of critical importance to further push the efficiency of PSCs towards the S–Q limitation. Among the perovskite devices we summarized above, the efficiencies are still below the S–Q limit due to the defect-assisted recombination losses at the interface of HTM/perovskite. Defects act as Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) nonradiative recombination centers resulting in energy loss and limiting the photovoltaic performance.201 And it is the main cause of density–voltage (J–V) hysteresis behavior of PSCs. Fortunately, most defects are located at the grain boundary and surface and can be passivated through Lewis acid–Lewis base coordination with uncoordinated Pd2+. Most high-efficiency reports mentioned above were attributed to the reduced defect densities and suppressed recombination losses at the perovskite/HTM interface, resulting in enhanced Voc, Jsc and FF of the devices. In this review, many passivate strategies are summarized, such as introducing sulfur, oxygen, selenium, nitrogen, and fluorine atoms and methylthio, carbonyl, and amino groups into the backbone of molecules.
3.2 Stability challenges
With the development of PSCs, the research focus has shifted from efficiency to stability recently.202–204 Although the number of research studies on stability is rapidly increasing, discussions are emerging on standards for how the stability of PSCs should be tested, making it difficult to compare the results from different labs. As we know, PSC devices employing dopant-free HTMs exhibit enhanced stability than PSCs with dopants in most cases. Among the different aging conditions, moisture, thermal and light stability are commonly stability conditions. Stability under certain relative humidity or ambient conditions evaluates the ability of dopant-free HTMs to protect the perovskite film from moisture in the environment. More than half of the unencapsulated devices retain 80% of their initial performance for 720 h in air indicating that dopant-free HTMs prevent the degradation of perovskites induced by moisture and oxygen due to their good hydrophobicity. To prevent the invasion of moisture and oxygen, HTMs should have good hydrophobicity through the introduction of some functional groups, like fluorine atoms, alkyl chains, etc.
Thermal stability is an important evaluation parameter for PSCs when considering the application of the device in hot climates with a working temperature of 65 °C.202 Generally, thermal stability is tested in a nitrogen environment at 85 °C. Only a few HTMs maintained more than 80% of their original PCEs after 720 h under the thermal conditions. Surprisingly, HTM-F retained 91% of its initial PCE after storing in a nitrogen atmosphere at 80 °C for 1000 h.163 The device stability under illumination is also important. To imitate the real scenario, continuous illumination under AM 1.5 in a nitrogen atmosphere is used as aging conditions. Similar to thermal stability, less than one-third of devices can retain 80% of their origin efficiencies after 720 h. YZ22 exhibited better photostability with 81% retention after 1000 h with an RH of 30% under continuous 1.1 sun equivalent illumination.113 The results reveal that it still needs great efforts to enhance thermal and light stability. Apart from the commonly used aging conditions, more harsher aging conditions like “heating at 85 °C with an RH of 85%” should be implemented to meet the industrial requirements.205
3.3 Low-cost challenges
In addition to efficiency and stability, cost is another key factor for dopant-free HTMs to realize the commercialization of PSCs. The costs of Spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA are $780 g−1 and $2,700 g−1 (from Sigma), respectively, which are the most widely used HTMs for n–i–p and p–i–n devices, respectively. The extremely high cost impedes translating PSCs from laboratory to commercial products. Nevertheless, the most expensive dopant-free HTM in the summary table is polymeric PBDB–Cz with a synthesis cost of $313 g−1 delivering a noticeable PCE of 22.0%. Moreover, only a few HTMs possess low synthesis costs below $20 g−1 with comparable efficiency of over 20%, such as SFDT–TMD, Cz–As, DTB–FL, TPADPP and N01. In particular, there are all small molecule HTMs. Therefore, to reduce the synthesis cost of HTMs, facile synthetic routes, cheap industrial chemicals and easy purification are highly required. More importantly, the cost of undoped HTMs in each device should be considered, not only the total synthesis cost of HTMs.
3.4 Molecular design principles
In this review, the important features of ideal dopant-free HTMs for high-performance PSCs are summarized as follows: (1) high hole mobility and conductivity to reduce recombination losses; (2) aligned HOMO and LUMO levels for efficient hole injection and electron blocking, respectively; (3) surface defect passivation to decrease non-radiative recombination and improve device stability; (4) good hydrophobicity to prevent incursion form moisture and oxygen and ensure long-term stability of PSCs; (5) low-cost of synthesis facilitating large-scale fabrication; (6) suitable solubility for solution-processing and forming a high quality HTM layer. However, there are some different design principles of dopant-free HTMs in conventional and inverted PSCs. First, the lower hole mobility is sufficient for inverted devices, typically exceeding 2.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. Second, the HTMs in inverted devices always possess a weak π-conjugation degree on the core units that can endow the molecules with high transparency to avoid competition with perovskite materials in incident light absorbance. In contrast, for the HTMs applied in conventional devices, the π-conjugation degree of the core units is relatively large in order to enhance hole mobility and conductivity. Third, in inverted devices, the crystal growth of perovskite film is significantly influenced by the contact angle of the perovskite precursor solutions on the HTM layers. Thereby, HTMs should have moderate hydrophobicity and suitable wettability with the perovskite precursor solutions.
3.5. Outlook
Although dopant-free HTMs have achieved great progress in recent years, efforts are still needed to develop efficient, stable and low-cost HTMs for PSCs. According to the S–Q limit, the highest PCE of PSC was calculated to be 30.1% with a Voc of 1.30 V, a Jsc of 25.47 mA cm−2, and an FF of 90.5% using an absorber with a bandgap of 1.6 eV.206 Considering the achievable FF in reference to the silicon solar cells of 85%, a PCE close to 27% is more realistically achievable.207 Aiming to further promote the efficiency to S–Q limitation, multifunctional dopant-free HTMs should be designed and synthesized that can not only extract and transport charge efficiently but also passivate the surface defects and suppress the recombination losses at the interface. Compared to polymeric HTMs, small molecule HTMs show greater potential for achieving efficient and low-cost PSCs. A very simple structure HTM like YZ22 still exhibited a remarkable PCE of 22.4% after careful molecular optimization.113 Meanwhile, we are impressed by its facile synthetic routes and cheap industrial chemicals. This is a great example for balancing the efficiency and cost of dopant-free HTMs. Besides, nearly all the reported dopant-free HTMs were processed using very toxic halogenated/aromatic solvents, such as chloroform, chlorobenzene and 1,2-dichlorobenzene, which are harmful to human health and environment. Therefore, green-solvent processed dopant-free HTMs with high-performance should be developed. In addition, the development of new dopant-free HTMs for efficient all-inorganic PSCs is urgent and the features of the dopant-free HTMs need to be further revealed. Finally, dopant-free HTMs for lead-free PSCs should also be considered because of their environmental friendliness. In conclusion, we hope that this review will be useful for the further design of dopant-free HTMs toward the eventual commercialization of PSCs.

Broader context
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as one of the promising third generation photovoltaic technologies with a low cost of manufacturing and comparable efficiency since 2009. Considerable progress has been made over the last decade in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs from 3.8% to 25.8%. However, high-efficiency PSCs based on doped hole transporting materials (HTMs) are still facing challenges in cost and stability. Developing dopant-free HTMs at a low-cost is an alternative way to achieve high-efficiency and stable PSCs simultaneously. In this article, we review very recent important advances in dopant-free HTMs providing high efficiency and enhanced stability for devices with different perovskite materials. Based on the correlation study between the molecular properties and device performance, design principles of ideal HTMs for commercialization are summarized to motivate further research of such materials in the future. And some perspectives on the development of dopant-free HTMs are provided. We hope this review will be helpful in advancing the development of dopant-free HTMs for efficient, stable and low-cost PSCs.
