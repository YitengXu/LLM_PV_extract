    , Accepted 16th May 2017First published on 17th May 2017AbstractRecently, organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites have gained great attention for their breakthrough in photovoltaic and optoelectronics. However, their thermal transport properties that affect the device lifetime and stability are still rarely explored. In this work, the thermal conductivity properties of single crystal CH3NH3PbI3 platelets grown by chemical vapor deposition are studied via non-contact micro-photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. We developed a measurement methodology and derived expressions suitable for the thermal conductivity extraction for micro-sized perovskites. The room temperature thermal conductivity of ∼0.14 ± 0.02 W m−1 K−1 is extracted from the dependence of the PL peak energy on the excitation laser power. On changing the film thickness from 80 to 400 nm, the thermal conductivity does not show noticeable variations, indicating the minimal substrate effects due to the advantage of the suspended configuration. The ultra-low thermal conductivity of perovskites, especially thin films, suggests their promising applications for thermal isolation, such as thermal insulation and thermo-electricity.
Introduction
Mixed organic–inorganic halides with perovskite crystalline structures such as CH3NH3PbI3 have received much attention due to their great potential in low cost, flexible solar cells.1–5 Due to their high absorption coefficient and large carrier diffusion length, the power conversion efficiency of solution processed perovskite solar cells has reached ∼22.1%, which is close to commercial crystalline silicon solar cells.6–10 As a semiconductor, perovskites also show an engineered wide-band gap, low non-radiative recombination rate and high external quantum efficiency, which are promising for other optoelectronic devices including lasers, LEDs, and photodetectors.10–13 Recent demonstration of laser cooling of 3D and 2D perovskite crystals has suggested that the thermal conductivity of perovskite materials is considerably small, leading to substantial improvement of the laser cooling amplitude per unit pumping power compared with II–VI semiconductors.14,15 In various applications in optoelectronic devices, knowing the accurate thermal transport properties of active materials is essential for their applications. Light irradiation and electric injection inevitably increase the device temperature locally due to the heating effect, which can enormously influence the device performance and lifetime. For instance, in solar cells and lasers, an absorbed photon relaxes its excess energy via generation of hot carriers, which then transfer their kinetic energy to the crystal lattice through momentum scattering and induce a device temperature increase. In light emitting devices, a large local heating effect may occur because of low electric injection efficiency, which induces a device temperature increase and hampers the emission efficiency of devices. Therefore, for perovskite based optoelectronic devices, a better understanding of the thermal transport properties of perovskites is important for not only improving the device performance, but also exploring new thermal-related applications. However, so far studies on the thermal properties of perovskites have been limited.16,17 It is worth noting that the suspended optical measurement setup on a suspended sample has been used by several groups in order to study the thermal conductivity of the layer material;18–21 most of them measured the Raman peak shift to monitor the temperature increase. For materials that have a weak PL signal, such as graphene and indirect band gap semiconductors, Raman measurements are suitable, while for materials that have a small Raman scattering cross section and strong PL signals, such as CH3NH3PbI3, using the PL peak position as a temperature indicator is more suitable. Compared to electrical methods,17 there are two important advantages for the optical method. Firstly, the PL or Raman method is non-contact and non-destructive, which is suitable for the materials that are not easy to fabricate as electrodes. Secondly, the micro-optical method is spatially resolved. It is especially suitable for the measurement of small and different regions of the micro sized samples.
In this work, we report an experimental investigation of the thermal conduction of CH3NH3PbI3 single crystals with the help of confocal micro-photoluminescence (micro-PL) spectroscopy. A measurement methodology and derived expressions suitable for the thermal conductivity evaluation are developed for micro-sized single crystal perovskite samples. High-quality CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) platelets are grown by a two-step chemical vapour deposition (CVD) method. The room temperature value of thermal conductivity is extracted from the laser power dependent PL peak energy. The thermal conductivity value κ is evaluated to be 0.14 ± 0.02 W m−1 K−1 at room temperature and this value shows little difference with different thicknesses from 80 to 400 nm.
Results and discussion
High quality MAPbI3 platelets are synthesized by using a home-built vapour phase deposition system with a standard two-step procedure reported in our previous literature. As shown in Fig. 1a, a PbI2 powder (99.999%, Aldrich) source and pre-cleaned SiO2/Si substrate were placed into a quartz tube installed on the home-built vapour phase deposition equipment. The temperature and pressure inside the quartz tube were set and stabilized at 380 °C and 200 Torr for 20 min with a continuous flow of high purity Ar premixed with 5% H2 gas. The furnace was cooled down naturally to ambient temperature. The PbI2 platelets were then transferred onto an SiO2 substrate patterned with air hole arrays. The SiO2/Si substrate with holes was prepared via the standard microfabrication procedure with photolithography followed by potassium hydroxide wet etching and reactive ion etching (RIE). The SiO2/Si substrate with PbI2 platelets was then put into a fresh quartz tube along with methyl ammonium iodide (MAI) located in the central area. The intercalation of methyl ammonium halide molecules via a gas–solid hetero-phase reaction was carried out at 115 °C for 2 h under a pressure of 50 Torr to convert the suspended PbI2 platelets to CH3NH3PbI3.22

(c)–(d) Optical images of an individual PbI2 platelet and the corresponding converted product of the CH3NH3PbI3 platelet. (e)–(f) Thickness of the PbI2 platelet and the CH3NH3PbI3 platelet in (c) and (d) by AFM characterization. Note that the difference in colour for the PbI2 and CH3NH3PbI3 platelets corresponds to the difference in thickness (as measured by AFM) and absorption change. The thickness of the CH3NH3PbI3 platelets was about 0.8 times larger than that of the corresponding PbI2 platelets, which agrees well with the ratio of the c lattice constant between the two compounds. 
The structure and morphology are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and optical microscopy. Fig. 1b shows the SEM image of the as-synthesized PbI2 platelets on the SiO2/Si substrate, illustrating that dominant PbI2 platelets and a small portion of bulk crystals are simultaneously grown on the silicon oxide surface. The platelets show highly flat and smooth facets with a surface roughness of ±1.5 nm measured by AFM (Fig. 1e). The SEM image of individual PbI2 platelets on the as-prepared silicon substrate (Fig. 1b, inset) suggests that one PbI2 platelet is suspended over several holes in the silicon substrate, which is used to probe the thermal conductivity in further work. Fig. 1c and d show the optical images of an individual PbI2 platelet (bright green) and a converted MAPbI3 platelet (brown). The thickness of the MAPbI3 platelets, measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM), was about 1.8 times that of the corresponding PbI2 platelets. It agrees well with the ratio of the c lattice constant between the two compounds reported in previous studies, suggesting the successful conversion of PbI2 to MAPbI3.

Fig. 2a shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and optical microscopy images (inset) of the as-synthesized PbI2 platelets (upper panel) and MAPbI3 platelets after MAI intercalation (bottom panel). Before conversion, due to the hexagonal structure of PbI2, the XRD patterns exhibit four strong peaks at ∼12.6°, 25.4°, 38.6° and 52.2°, which correspond to the crystal directions 001, 002, 003 and 004, respectively, which is in good agreement with previous studies. After conversion, the identical peaks disappeared, and several other peaks from tetragonal MAPbI3 were detected as shown in the lower part of Fig. 2.23 The XRD pattern suggests a crystalline structure of the as-grown perovskite. Peaks from PbI2 disappear suggesting the full conversion from PbI2 to MAPbI3. The fringe spacing (0.31 nm, see the inset of Fig. 2c) matches well with the inter-planar spacing of the (220) plane from the tetragonal MAPbI3 crystal, while the fringe spacing of 0.70 nm in the inset of Fig. 2b matches well with the inter-planar spacing of the (001) plane of the tetragonal PbI2. Moreover, the absorption (blue dots) and PL (orange squares) spectra of PbI2 and MAPbI3 platelets at room temperature also indicate successful conversion of PbI2 to MAPbI3 (see Fig. 2b and c). The absorption and PL spectra of PbI2 platelets suggest an absorption edge around 500 nm and a single PL peak with a Gaussian profile centered at ∼500 nm (Fig. 2b). In MAPbI3 (Fig. 2c), the absorption edge and PL emission move to ∼770 nm, which is consistent with the band edge emission of MAPbI3.22 The conversion time from PbI2 to MAPbI3 was optimized to be 2 hours with the help of an XRD study (Fig. S1†). When the conversion time was too short (∼1 h), the PbI2 and MAPbI3 coexisted, as seen from the XRD pattern. With the advance of time, the PbI2 peaks totally disappear at the complete conversion stage. Raman spectra were also recorded before and after conversion to confirm the full conversion of PbI2 to the perovskite. The Raman spectra show four distinct bands at ∼14, 70, 94, and 110 cm−1 (Fig. S2†), which indicates that the MAPbI3 platelets maintain the 4H polytype of PbI2. The phonon vibration located at ∼14 cm−1 was assigned to E23, the shear-motion rigid-layer mode of PbI2 with a 4H polytype, while the Raman peaks at ∼70, 94, and 110 cm−1 were assigned to E21, A11 and A12, respectively.

In semiconductors, the electronic and phonon structures including band gap and phonon energy are highly dependent on temperature. For example, with the increase of temperature, the semiconductor band gap decreases because of thermal broadening. Band edge PL and Raman modes can be used as thetemperature indicator.24,25 Both PL and Raman spectroscopy methods are considered as reliable, non-contact methods to probe the local temperature of semiconductors. However, to perform efficient temperature measurement via Raman spectroscopy, the excitation laser energy may be too high to destroy MAPbI3. Considering the strong emission properties of MAPbI3, confocal PL microscopy is adopted to measure the local temperature in this work.

Fig. 3a shows the temperature dependent PL spectra of an individual MAPbI3 platelet. The power of the pump laser (λ = 532 nm, Elaser = 2.33 eV) was kept as low as 5 μW to minimize the laser heating effect. As the temperature increases from 280 K to 330 K, the MAPbI3 platelet on the SiO2 substrate exhibits a single emission peak due to band-edge emission, which shifts monotonically from 771 nm (ca. EPL = 1.608 eV) to 767 nm (ca. EPL = 1.617 eV) (Fig. 3a). The temperature dependent PL energy is different from that in traditional technologically important semiconductors such as Si and GaAs, but is widely observed in perovskites.26,27 The PL peaks of different kinds of hybrid perovskites such as films and platelets all showed a blue shift with temperature increasing near room temperature,28 and the slope mainly depends on the composition of the halide. A possible reason is electron–phonon coupling,29 which is not the emphasis of this work. The PL energy EPL of MAPbI3 is extracted out and plotted versus temperature T (Fig. 3b), which could be well fitted as a linear function of EPL = E0 + α·T as in previous reports.28,29 The value of the coefficient α is 0.16 ± 0.02 meV K−1 within the temperature range from 280 K to 330 K. The linear relationship between PL energy EPL and sample temperature T promises to be a good monitor to probe local temperature fluctuation by PL spectroscopy.

In order to measure thermal conductivity properties, MAPbI3 platelets are suspended to build an isolated thermal system to eliminate the influence of environmental thermal conduction (Fig. 3c). First of all, we conducted a detailed analysis on the thermal dynamics for the isolated MAPbI3 system. In absorption and emission processes, the absorbed photons stimulate hot carriers with non-zero kinetic energy, which then decay quickly to the band edge and transfer their kinetic energy to the lattice through phonon scattering. As a result, the thermal equilibrium process of photon-excited hot carriers results in heating of samples. The heat can be transported by three pathways: material conduction, gas convection and radiation. In this work, the MAPbI3 samples are located in a vacuum and have small temperature differences with the environment, thus the gas convection and radiation can be negligible. Therefore, the photon induced heat in the suspended area can only dissipate by conducting to the surrounding area along the platelet itself. According to Fourier's law, the thermal conduction through a cross-section of the suspended sample is ,30 where Q is the heating power per unit time, κ is thermal conductivity, and ∇T is the temperature gradient of the cross sectional area element dS. As shown in Fig. 3d, since the SiO2/Si substrate can be taken as a thermal reservoir, the temperature increase of the non-suspended area is small and undetectable. Therefore, the temperature rise is strictly confined to the suspended area. After integrating the differential form of Fourier's law from the excitation spot to the edge of the suspended area in a two-dimensional circular geometry, the thermal conductivity can be written as κ = γ·(Q/ΔT).21 Here, γ = ln(R2/R1)/2πh is a structure factor and ΔT is the energy difference between the excitation laser spot position and thermal reservoir. R1, R2, and h are the excitation laser spot diameter, hole diameter and sample thickness, respectively. For a typical sample and thermal system, the structure factor is a constant. In our experiment, the hole diameter is about 3.6 μm. We choose the hole size according to two considerations: (1) the hole size has to be large enough to elucidate extra error, especially compared to the laser spot and we suggest that the hole diameter should be at least 3 times the laser spot; (2) the hole size has to be moderate so that each platelet can be suspended and cover several holes, and different regions of the same platelet can be measured. The temperature difference between the excitation spot and thermal reservoir ΔT is linear to the excitation laser power. Therefore, thermal conductivity can be expressed by the following equation, κ = γ·(Q1 − Q2)/(Ti1 − Ti2), where Ti1 and Ti2 are the laser excited area temperatures under heating powers Q1 and Q2, respectively. According to the above equation, the thermal conductivity can be extracted out directly by power dependent photoluminescence spectroscopy.
Next, power dependent PL spectroscopy of suspended MAPbI3 platelets is conducted. A 532 nm solid state laser is adopted to obtain strong emission and ensure a high heat effect, according to MAPbI3 absorption spectroscopy. For ultraviolet lasers, the heat is too strong to damage the sample even under low power; for longer wavelength lasers, the heating effect is too small to be detected. The laser power was kept below 35 μW in our experiments to exclude the band filling effect induced peak shift.31 The laser spot radius is ∼0.5 μm. As shown in Fig. 4a and b, when the excitation laser power P increases from 10 μW to 35 μW, the PL peak shifts from 766.48 nm (ca. EPL = 1.617 eV) to 764.24 nm (ca. EPL = 1.622 eV). According to temperature dependent PL spectroscopy (Fig. 3b), the peak shifts suggest a temperature increase of 29.6 K. The PL energy EPL at different laser powers P is further extracted out, which can be well fitted by a linear function of laser power P with a slope of δEPL/δP = 0.26 ± 0.01 meV μW−1 (Fig. 4c). Different from traditional semiconductors such as GaAs and Si where the band gap temperature relationship has been well explained by traditional models,32–34 efforts on perovskites have been made28,29 and further investigation is still needed.

All the spectra except the bottom one are offset vertically for clarity. (b) Zoomed PL data of the suspended platelet under different laser powers to show the shift clearly. (c) The experimental data and the fitting of band edge PL peak energy shift with laser power difference. The spectra were collected from different samples with similar thicknesses under the laser excitation of 532 nm by using the confocal system. The measurement environment was kept at room temperature. 
The equilibrium carriers near to the band carrier lose their energy through three recombination processes: non-radiative, radiative, and Auger. For non-radiative and Auger processes, the carrier energy is converted to lattice vibration, while for the radiative process, the carrier energy escapes as photons and does not contribute to lattice vibration. Then, the effective energy of laser excitation Qeff that contributes to the thermal energy or temperature increase in MAPbI3 is evaluated. After considering the laser excitation induced heating power Qeff can be written as Qeff = P·β, where β = p·(η·(Elaser − EPL)/EPL + (1 − η)) is the heating factor, p is the absorption rate, and η is the quantum yield. The PL quantum efficiency of MAPbI3 is ∼90 ± 5% by our measurement because of the relatively small non-radiative and Auger rate.35 The room temperature absorption coefficient of MAPbI3 at 532 nm is about 5.5 × 104 cm−1. Therefore, the corresponding absorption rate p is about 82% for 300 nm platelets, which is in agreement with absorption spectra using a micro-spectrometer.9 With these parameters, β is deduced to be 0.31 ± 0.1. Combining the PL energy shift coefficient α and the heating factor β, we obtained the averaged thermal conductivity of the as-grown MAPbI3 at room temperature as κ = 0.14 ± 0.02 W m−1 K−1. The obtained value in our work is close to that obtained in solution-processed samples (0.5 W m−1 K−1 by Pisoni et al.;17 0.3 W m−1 K−1 by Guo et al.;36 and 0.59 W m−1 K−1 by Qian et al.37). The slight difference may be due to the interface effect which is highly dependent on thermal conductivity measurement methods. For example, Guo et al. observed the reduction of thermal conductivity on the Al2O3 substrate compared with the Si substrate.36 In this work, the samples are suspended to exclude the substrate–sample interface thermal conduction, which is expected to obtain a more accurate thermal conductivity parameter. We noticed that a recent theoretical paper38 pointed out that during the Raman measurement of single layer graphene, different phonon modes can't reach equilibrium because of weak electron–phonon coupling and optical–acoustic phonon coupling. The nonequilibrium leads to underestimation of the thermal conductivity. The strong electron–phonon coupling in CH3NH3PbI3 allows us to neglect this effect, but it might be important for weak electron–phonon coupling materials.
To have a further understanding of the thermal conduction properties of the as-grown MAPbI3, we have measured the thermal conductivity of CH3NH3PbI3 platelets with different thicknesses from around 80 to 400 nm, as shown in Fig. 5 (these MAPbI3 platelets were converted from different thicknesses of PbI2; for more details see the ESI Fig. S3†). The value of thermal conductivity remains almost constant (∼0.14 W m−1 K−1) in the range of 80–400 nm. In MAPbI3, thermal conduction could be mainly accomplished by phonon scattering, which is intrinsically influenced by the thermal capacity, free mean path and velocity of phonons. The defects, lattice disorders, could reduce the free mean path of phonons and then the thermal conductivity. On the other hand, the thickness of platelets is several hundreds of nanometres, in which dimension surface scattering may play an important role. The thickness independent thermal conduction behaviour of the as-grown MAPbI3 suggests high uniformity of their crystalline structures. The grain boundary scattering induced by morphological disorder can also be excluded because of the single crystalline structure of the as-grown MAPbI3. Furthermore, although surface effects could arise in the dimension from 80 to 400 nm, surface phonon scattering has little effect on the thermal conduction of MAPbI3. Compared to the lattice vibration, the thermal conductivity contribution of electrons is 2 to 4 orders of magnitude smaller,17 and so we suggest that the lattice contribution dominates in the thermal conductivity.

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a non-contact optical method to measure the thermal conductivity of single crystal MAPbI3 platelets. A measurement methodology and derived expressions suitable for thermal conductivity evaluation for micro-sized perovskites are explored. The substrate effect is minimized due to the advantage of the suspended configuration. Using this expression, the thermal conductivity at room temperature κ = 0.14 ± 0.02 W m−1 K−1 is obtained for two-step CVD grown MAPbI3. The thermal conductivity does not change with the platelet thickness, suggesting the uniformity of the as-prepared perovskite platelets and less surface phonon scattering contribution to thermal conduction. The ultra-low thermal conductivity indicates that the MAPbI3 platelets can be a promising candidate, especially very thin films, for thermal insulation and thermal electrics related usage.
Experimental methods
The crystalline structure and morphology are characterized by Atomic Force Microscopy (Veeco Dimension V), scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL 7001F), X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8-Advance) and TEM (FEI Tecnai F20). A WITec alpha300 RAS Raman system with a piezo crystal controlled scanning stage, an objective lens of 100× magnification (numerical aperture, NA = 0.95), and an Electron Multiplying CCD were used for recording Raman spectra. All the Raman spectra were recorded under an excitation laser of 532 nm (Elaser = 2.33 eV). Micro-PL spectroscopy of individual platelets is conducted by using a confocal triple-grating spectrometer (Horiba-JY T6400) in a backscattering configuration. Micro-absorption spectra from a single perovskite platelet are obtained on a home-made micro-based measurement system. A 532 nm solid-state laser is focused by an objective (Nikon, 50×, NA = 0.45) and excites platelets with a beam diameter of ∼1 μm. The PL emission signal is collected by the same objective and dispersed by using a monochromator with a 600 g cm−1 grating and then analysed by using a liquid helium cooled charge-coupled device (CCD, Princeton Instruments). A 532 nm long-pass filter is used to block the excitation laser line. A continuous-flow microscopy cryostat is used for low-temperature PL spectra measurement. The SiO2/Si substrate with platelets was pasted onto the sample stage using GE varnish (Oxford Bearings Limited Company).

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Schematic illustration of the preparation procedures of the perovskite platelets on hole arrays: PbI2 platelets being grown on an SiO2/Si substrate; transferring the PbI2 platelets on the SiO2 substrate onto the as-prepared Si substrate with hole arrays; converting the suspended PbI2 platelet to CH3NH3PbI3. (b) SEM image of PbI2 platelets grown on the SiO2/Si substrate. The inset shows the SEM image of PbI2 platelets after being converted to CH3NH3PbI3. The scale bar inside the image is 5 μm. (c)–(d) Optical images of an individual PbI2 platelet and the corresponding converted product of the CH3NH3PbI3 platelet. (e)–(f) Thickness of the PbI2 platelet and the CH3NH3PbI3 platelet in (c) and (d) by AFM characterization. Note that the difference in colour for the PbI2 and CH3NH3PbI3 platelets corresponds to the difference in thickness (as measured by AFM) and absorption change. The thickness of the CH3NH3PbI3 platelets was about 0.8 times larger than that of the corresponding PbI2 platelets, which agrees well with the ratio of the c lattice constant between the two compounds.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) XRD pattern of the as-grown CVD synthesized PbI2 platelets (above) and after conversion to CH3NH3PbI3 platelets (below). After conversion, identical peaks of PbI2 (001, 002, 003, 004) disappeared, and several peaks belong to tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3 were detected. The upper inset shows the microscopy photograph of one as-grown PbI2 platelet and the lower inset is the photograph of the same platelet after conversion. (b) The absorption and PL spectra of single PbI2 platelets. The inset is a high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image showing the lattice of the crystal. Fringe spacing of 0.70 nm matches well with the inter-planar spacing of the (001) plane of the hexagon PbI2. The scale bar inside the image is 1 nm. (c) The absorption and PL spectra of single CH3NH3PbI3 platelets. The inset is a HRTEM image showing the lattice of the crystal. Fringe spacing of 0.31 nm matches well with the inter-planar spacing of the (220) plane of the tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3. The scale bar inside the image is 1 nm.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Normalized PL spectra of single CH3NH3PbI3 platelets in the temperature range from 280 to 330 K, excited by 532 nm laser at 5 μW. (b) The relation between PL emission peaks and the temperature; the peak shift temperature coefficient was obtained through the linear fitting slope. (c) Schematic experiment setup for the non-contact thermal conductivity measurement; it shows the excitation laser light focused on a platelet, which is suspended onto a hole array on a silicon substrate. (d) Zoomed-in area for deducing the expression suitable for the thermal conductivity extraction for micro sized perovskite. The green spot represents the focused laser. The red area is the suspended area. The grey colour area is the heat sink reservoir.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Normalized PL spectra of one typical suspended platelet at different laser powers; the laser wavelength is 532 nm. All the spectra except the bottom one are offset vertically for clarity. (b) Zoomed PL data of the suspended platelet under different laser powers to show the shift clearly. (c) The experimental data and the fitting of band edge PL peak energy shift with laser power difference. The spectra were collected from different samples with similar thicknesses under the laser excitation of 532 nm by using the confocal system. The measurement environment was kept at room temperature.	 

 	Fig. 5  Thickness dependent thermal conductivity values for MAPbI3 platelets. In the range of 80 to 400 nm, the values of thermal conductivity remain almost constant.
