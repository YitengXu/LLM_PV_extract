    , Accepted 21st May 2011First published on 4th July 2011AbstractNb-doped TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared by a continuous spray drying process using ammonium niobate (V) oxalate and titanium oxysulfate as water-soluble precursors. The structural and electronic properties were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Nb was found to be mainly incorporated as Nb5+ into the TiO2 lattice resulting in a charge compensation by Ti vacancies. The characterization results indicate that Nb was homogeneously distributed within the titania lattice, and that the surface segregation of Nb, which is commonly observed for Nb-doped TiO2, was significantly less pronounced. The high homogeneity and the lower extent of surface segregation originate from the efficient atomization of homogeneous precursor solutions and the fast evaporation of the solvent in the spray drying process. As a result, the ion mobility is diminished and spheres of well-mixed precursor materials are formed. Using the continuous spray drying process followed by a controlled heat treatment, the phase composition, the crystal size and the surface area of the Nb-doped TiO2 nanoparticles are easily adjustable.
Introduction
Transition metal oxides such as titanium dioxide (TiO2) have been extensively studied in the last few decades for various applications. TiO2-based materials of different particle size and morphology are used in scientifically and technologically interesting areas such as the photocatalytic splitting of water,1 environmental cleanup,2 gas sensing,3,4 and in fuel cells.5 Furthermore, TiO2 is applied as support material in heterogeneous catalysis due to strong metal–support interactions, high stability in oxidizing environments, low cost, and commercial availability.6 Due to the wide band gaps of the commonly used TiO2 modifications of anatase (3.2 eV) and rutile (3.0 eV), it is often necessary to modify their band structure.6–8 For photocatalytic applications the modification of the band structure is intended to lead to visible light absorption, whereas in electrochemical applications the conductivity of TiO2 needs to be enhanced by tuning its band gap.
The applicability of wide band gap oxides can be improved by different methods including doping with anions or cations.9,10 Typically, anions such as N, C, F or S can be used to substitute lattice oxygen anions, whereas transition metal cations substitute Ti cations.11–14 Depending on the application it is crucial to consider the splitting of the d orbitals of transition metals and the effect of their different electron configurations. In addition, the formation of solid solutions of two or more oxides is commonly used to change the band structures of wide band gap oxides.
In recent years Nb was employed to dope TiO2 particles or films for different applications.4,5,15,16 These investigations showed that the doped materials can be applied as conductive support for cathode catalysts in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs),5,17 as counter electrode in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),18–20 and as transparent conductive oxides (TCOs).21
The incorporation of Nb into the titania lattice leads to changes in the electronic structure, which are extensively discussed in the literature. The charge compensation of Nb5+ substituting Ti4+ depends on the oxygen partial pressure, the temperature applied during the synthesis, and the Nb concentration. It can be achieved by two mechanisms: one possibility is the reduction of one Ti4+ to Ti3+ for every Nb5+ incorporated (eqn (1)), the other possibility is the formation of one Ti vacancy per four Nb5+ introduced (eqn (2)). (1) (2)Reaction (1) mainly occurs at low oxygen partial pressures and in the synthesis of samples with high Nb content. In this case one excess electron occupies the Ti 3d orbital leading to an increase in the electron density. Using high oxygen partial pressures favors the formation of titanium vacancies (eqn (2)). In addition, the substitution of Ti4+ by Nb4+ can be obtained by a high temperature treatment in reducing atmosphere.
The preparation of doped powder materials can be achieved by different methods, such as hydrothermal synthesis,5,19pyrolysis,22,23 high temperature ceramic routes,24–26 and sol–gel methods.11,27–29 These methods usually involve complicated processes, and the resulting properties of the product strongly depend on the various process parameters. Furthermore, the scale-up of these methods is rather difficult. For instance, Kubacka et al.11,12 prepared doped TiO2 materials by a microemulsion method. This sophisticated preparation comprises stirring for 24 h followed by several additional steps, such as centrifugation, drying, and washing, which is rather time-consuming. The synthesis of Nb-doped TiO2 by a hydrothermal method described by Park and Seol5 is another example for a rather time-consuming process. Furthermore, both preparation techniques require very hydrophilic materials, which have to be handled skillfully. The high temperature ceramic route used for the synthesis of doped TiO2 is an energy-intensive process. For example, Morris et al.24 used ceramics for valence band studies, where the starting materials were treated at temperatures as high as 1000 °C for several days.
Recently, spray drying has been successfully employed as a fast and scalable method for the preparation of oxide materials. Kaluza et al.30–32 used a coupled precipitation-spray drying approach to prepare high surface area ZnO nanoparticles and ZnO–Al2O3 nanocomposites as supports for copper catalysts applied in methanol synthesis. By using this spray drying technique, it was possible to investigate the aging process of the polycrystalline precipitates as well as the role of the post-treatment during the catalyst preparation. Hence, important preparation parameters can be easily controlled using this approach, whereas in conventional batch processes the investigation of the aging of the precipitate appeared to be rather difficult. Spray drying has also been used for the synthesis of TiO2 materials. Sizgek et al.33 prepared titanates by a coupled sol–gel and spray drying approach resulting in well-defined microspheres. This method revealed that the particle porosity and morphology strongly depend on the dispersion of the used sol. Porous TiO2 nanowires and macroporous particles for photocatalytic applications were prepared by Zhang et al.34 and Iskandar et al.35 Zhang et al.34 used suspensions of powdered nanowires and a surfactant to synthesize hierarchically porous TiO2 microspheres consisting of nanowires, whereas Iskandar et al.35 focused on the preparation of macroporous brookite nanoparticles using suspensions of brookite nanoparticles together with a template for spray drying. The obtained macroporous particles showed higher photocatalytic activity in waste-water treatment compared to dense particles due to higher surface area.35 Thus, applying the spray drying approach combines several major advantages, such as homogeneous particle size distribution, fast drying under mild conditions, and good parameter control. However, finding a soluble TiO2 precursor suitable for spray drying is challenging, and, to the best of our knowledge, the synthesis of cation-doped TiO2 by spray drying has not yet been reported.
In this contribution, we present a continuous method for the synthesis of Nb-doped TiO2 nanoparticles by spray drying. A peristaltic pump transports an acidic solution containing Nb and Ti ions into the two-fluid nozzle of the spray dryer. After rapid evaporation of the liquid and separation of the gas, the solid can be collected as colorless powder. The segregation of the ions and particle aggregation are avoided due to the rapid drying process. Thus, the Nb and Ti cations are well mixed within the powder. The spray drying process leads to a narrow particle size distribution, because the ion content of the feed solution is homogeneously dispersed and the atomization by the nozzle is well defined. Furthermore, the scale-up of this synthesis route to an industrial level is easily feasible.
Experimental

Sample preparation


          Titanium oxysulfate sulfuric acid hydrate (TiOSO4 × H2SO4 × H2O, synthesis grade) and ammonium niobate (V) oxalate hydrate ((NH4)NbO(C2O4)2 × H2O, 99.9%, denoted as ANO) were supplied by Aldrich and used as received. The Ti complex was dissolved in nitric acid solution (c = 1 mol L−1) by stirring for at least 4 h. Subsequently, a predetermined amount of the ANO complex was added to the colorless solution to achieve Nb concentrations between 0.2 and 50 at% relative to Ti. The obtained solution was stirred for 1 h and used for the synthesis of Nb-doped TiO2 precursor materials through a continuous spray drying method. A bench-top spray dryer (B-290, Büchi) with a two-fluid nozzle was used for fast evaporation of the fluid.30–32 The colorless powder samples were collected from the dryer and calcined under flowing synthetic air (20.5% O2 in He, 100 sccm) at 600 °C, 700 °C or 800 °C for 1 h. A heating rate of 1 K min−1 was applied leaving sufficient time for flushing out volatile species evolving during the decomposition of the precursors. After calcination the samples were thoroughly washed with distilled water and dried in static air for 24 h at 110 °C. The prepared samples are labeled based on the composition and the calcination temperature. For instance, Ti0.998Nb0.002-700 indicates a theoretical composition of 99.8 at% Ti ions and 0.2 at% Nb ions and a calcination temperature of 700 °C. For comparison, monometallic Ti or Nb oxides were prepared using single Ti or Nb sources, where ANO was also dissolved in acidic solution.
Characterization methods
The materials were investigated by means of thermogravimetry coupled with mass spectrometry (TG-MS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy, nitrogen physisorption, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). TG-MS analysis was carried out in a Cahn TG 2131 thermobalance coupled with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Balzer, Omnistar). Samples were heated to 800 °C with a heating rate of 2 K min−1 in synthetic air at a total flow rate of 30 sccm. XRD studies were performed with a PANalytical MPD diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation in a 2Θ range from 10 to 70°. Powder Diffraction Files (PDF2) from the International Centre of Diffraction Data (ICDD) combined with the X'Pert Line software (Panalytical, Almelo) were used for qualitative phase analysis. Raman measurements were performed with a Nexus FT-NIR spectrometer equipped with a nitrogen-cooled germanium detector and a 1064 nm laser (Nd:YAG) provided by Thermo Fisher Scientific. UV-Vis spectra were recorded in the diffuse reflectance mode in a Perkin Elmer Lambda 650 UV-Vis spectrometer equipped with a Praying-Mantis mirror construction. The obtained spectra were converted by the Kubelka–Munk function F(R) into absorption spectra using BaSO4 as white standard. Static nitrogen physisorption experiments were performed at the boiling point of liquid N2 subsequent to out-gassing at 150 °C in a Quantachrome Autosorb-1-MP setup. Data were analyzed according to the BET equation assuming that the area covered by one N2 molecule is 0.162 nm2. The mean diameter d(BET) was calculated based on the assumption of non-porous spherical particles. The density of anatase (ρanatase = 3.85 × 103 kg m−3)36 was used in all cases. It has to be noted that this is only a rough approximation for materials with imperfect structures. The pore size distribution was obtained applying the BJH equation. The morphology of the powder materials was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a high resolution thermally aided field emission SEM (Zeiss, LEO 1530 Gemini). XPS measurements were carried out in an UHV set-up equipped with a Gammadata-Scienta SES 2002 analyzer. The base pressure in the measurement chamber was 5 × 10−10 mbar. Monochromatic Al Kα (1486.6 eV; 13.5 kV; 37 mA) was used as incident radiation and a pass energy of 200 eV was chosen resulting in an energy resolution better than 0.6 eV. Charging effects were compensated using a flood gun, and binding energies were calibrated based on positioning the main C 1s peak at 284.5 eV, which originates from carbon contaminations.
Results and discussion
Common Ti compounds such as TiCl4 are typically air- and water-sensitive rendering them unsuitable as Ti source for spray drying. Titanium oxysulfate dissolves slowly in HNO3 under stirring and is stable in acidic solutions. As the spray dryer was equipped with glass reactors and Teflon tubing, it was possible to use the Ti- and Nb-containing acidic solution directly for the spray drying synthesis resulting in colorless powders collected in the product vessel.

TG-MS applied to the precursor materials
The decomposition of the powders obtained from spray drying, i.e. the precursor for mixed TiNb oxides, was first studied by TG-MS in flowing air. The TG-MS results of pure Ti1, pure Nb1, and Ti0.5Nb0.5 mixed precursors are shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen that the weight loss of the pure Ti precursor occurred in two steps: at around 78 °C accompanied by the release of H2O (m/e = 18), and at about 580 °C accompanied by the release of a small amount of CO2 (m/e = 44) (Fig. 1a). Surprisingly, SO2 (m/e = 64) and SO3 (m/e = 80) were not detected by MS in the whole temperature range. Obviously, the Ti precursor decomposed completely to TiO2 at about 600 °C. Further heating to 800 °C caused a negligible weight loss. The transformation temperature to TiO2 of 540–580 °C is in good agreement with the results reported by Johnsson et al.37 They observed that the weight loss in the temperature region below 540 °C is only related to the release of water. According to the obtained TG data of the spray-dried TiOSO4 sample, water mainly desorbs below 200 °C, and no further weight loss is detected up to 540 °C. Hence, water is bound less strongly to the spray-dried sample. The major weight loss above 540 °C can be assigned to the decomposition of the precursor and the release of different sulfur species as suggested by Johnsson et al.37 Due to the lack of strong contributions from SO2 and SO3, the sulfur content in the precursor is presumably released as H2SO4 in the applied temperature region. Thus, the decomposition process can be described by the following equation: (3)

The decomposition profile of the spray-dried ANO precursor shown in Fig. 1b can also be divided into two main regions. The first weight loss region from 50 °C to 250 °C is associated with the release of CO (m/e = 28), CO2 (m/e = 44), and water (m/e = 18). The second decomposition region is indicated by a sharp increase in the CO2 signal at 510 °C. Furthermore, sharp CO and CO2 decomposition peaks are detected at 540 and 560 °C, and no further weight loss is observed above 600 °C. The second decomposition can be assigned to the decomposition of strongly bound oxalate or, more likely, to oxalate encapsulated in Nb2O5, whereas a weight loss below 200 °C is mainly due to the loss of water and ammonia.38 The loosely bound oxalate is decomposed between 250 and 350 °C.38 In the case of the spray-dried ANO sample the decomposition of the oxalate already starts at 140 °C and is terminated at 250 °C. Thus, for the spray-dried ANO precursor the conversion into Nb2O5 is favored. It is interesting to note that both the low and high temperature regions consist of three different CO and CO2 peaks. Therefore, the carbon species in the spray-dried ANO powder could exist in three different environments. Hence, the overall equation of the decomposition of the spray-dried ANO precursor can be described as: (4)
In Fig. 1c the decomposition profile of the spray-dried Ti0.5Nb0.5 precursor is shown. The profile obtained with this sample is more related to the decomposition of a mixed phase rather than the decomposition of pure TiOSO4 (Ti1) or the pure ANO (Nb1) precursor. The first strong weight loss signal is located at 140 °C. This weight loss is clearly related to the evolution of CO and CO2 and can be assigned to the decomposition of the oxalate species from the ANO precursor. A second major weight loss is detected at 290 °C, which is also related to the evolution of CO and CO2 and is not observed in any of the reference samples. Compared to the ANO (Nb1) sample the decomposition accompanied by the release of CO2 is shifted towards higher temperatures. Therefore, this weight loss can be assigned to the decomposition of a mixed phase containing Nb and Ti. The third strong weight loss occurs in the region of 540 to 640 °C with a maximum located at 630 °C. The peak obtained by DTG analysis is rather broad and the MS signals show two decomposition steps. The first step centered at 585 °C may be related to the decomposition of a pure Ti phase, whereas at higher temperatures mixed Ti–Nb phases may be fully converted into oxides. Additionally, it can be seen from Fig. 1 that the water signals vary for different precursors.
The Ti1 precursor shows mainly one peak with a maximum at around 80 °C and a change in the background of the m/e = 18 signal at 580 °C, which may be related with the release of another species. The ANO precursor exhibits two steps mainly below 500 °C and in the case of 1:1 mixtures of Nb and Ti (Ti0.5Nb0.5) two broad water peaks of low intensity are detected at 150 and 585 °C.
The TG-MS profiles of the precursors containing a small amount of Nb ions between 0.5 and 10 at% are presented in Fig. 2. The profiles obtained are quite similar to the decomposition profile of the spray-dried TiOSO4 precursor. With increasing Nb content two new features appear: first, a decomposition peak at low temperatures is observed, which is associated with the evolution of CO2 at 137 °C. In addition, a second weight loss signal in the high temperature region at 582 °C appears, which becomes broader with increasing Nb amount. Thus, the second decomposition process already starts at lower temperature. Due to the low amount of Nb ions the conversion into TiO2 is not significantly affected as indicated by the DTG curve. Even with higher Nb doping the measured TG-MS profiles are similar suggesting that even with a loading of 10 at% the Nb ions are well dispersed within the TiO2 particles without the formation of NbOx islands. The formation of Nb2O5 or the formation of solid solutions of a NbTixOy type should result in TG profiles similar to those presented in Fig. 1b and c, respectively. None of the characteristic peaks in the DTG curves is observed in the case of the samples with low Nb content. In comparison with the TG-MS data presented in Fig. 1b and c the decomposition of the loosely bound oxalate occurs at lower temperature, and the release of strongly bound carbon and sulfur species is also shifted to lower temperatures. These shifts can be rationalized by assuming that small amounts of Nb ions have a positive influence on the decomposition of sulfate, and Ti ions are positively influencing the oxidation of carbon species. It is worth mentioning that the oxidation of CO to CO2 is no longer favored for the Ti0.9Nb0.1 sample and that the MS signal detected at mass 18 becomes broader in this case. Both observations indicate that the local environment of the Nb ions corresponds more and more to the environment of Nb ions in the Ti0.5Nb0.5 sample forming a solid NbTixOy solution.

Structural characterization by XRD and Raman spectroscopy
Based on the TG-MS results the precursors with different Ti to Nb ratios were calcined at 600, 700 or 800 °C. The structures of the calcined samples were characterized by XRD and Raman spectroscopy. The obtained diffraction patterns are shown in Fig. 3. The calcination of Ti1 and Ti0.95Nb0.05 at 600 °C leads to the full decomposition of the precursor as shown by the TG analysis. However, conversion into the tetragonal anatase phase is not fully completed, as minor diffraction lines of the monoclinic β-TiO2 phase are additionally detected (Fig. 3a). The β-phase is structurally related to anatase, with which it may be semicoherently intergrown,39 and to which it irreversibly reacts upon heating.40 In the case of the Ti0.95Nb0.05-600 sample the diffraction peaks are broader and less intense than those of Ti1-600. Thus, the incorporation of Nb is accompanied by the formation of smaller crystallites (see below). In the 700 °C calcination series, the decomposition of the precursor and the transformation to the anatase structure are complete for samples with low Nb-loading up to 1 at% (Fig. 3b). For Ti0.95Nb0.05-700 and Ti0.9Nb0.1-700 small diffraction peaks of β-TiO2 are detected in addition to anatase, but no characteristic peaks of the rutile phase are observed in the diffraction patterns. Furthermore, the diffraction maxima of the Nb-doped anatase specimens (corrected with the NIST SRM 660a LaB6 standard for instrumental aberrations in 2Θ) slightly shifts to lower diffraction angles indicating the incorporation of Nb ions into Ti lattice sites.41
 Fig. 3  
            X-Ray diffraction patterns of the spray-dried precursors calcined at different temperatures. Spray-dried powder without Nb and low Nb doping levels calcined at (a) 600 °C, (b) 700 °C, and (c) 800 °C. The diffraction patterns of anatase TiO2 (21-1272) and rutile TiO2 (88-1175) are included for comparison. 
The lattice expansion of anatase due to the incorporation of Nb is quantified with the refined lattice parameters (Table 1). While the lattice parameters of the Ti1-700 anatase are a = 3.784(1) Å and c = 9.505(5) Å, which is in good agreement with values reported in the literature,42 the cell parameters increase up to a = 3.791(3) Å and c = 9.510(12) Å in the Ti0.9Nb0.1-700 sample. This increase in the cell parameters with increasing Nb content confirms that Nb is incorporated in the anatase lattice, because the ionic radius of the Nb5+ ions into octahedral coordination is larger than that of Ti4+.43 In addition, the effect of Nb on the size and morphology of anatase crystallites was investigated by means of the integral breadth method.44 The apparent size εβ of all anatase lattice planes (hkl) (measured by pattern decomposition and corrected for instrumental line broadening) is concordant indicating the absence of crystallite shape anisotropy in all samples. Ignoring the potential minor effects of lattice imperfections (e.g. intercalation of β-TiO2 lamellae with anatase) and strain on line broadening, a volume-weighted mean d(XRD) is calculated from the arithmetic mean of the apparent size values in each sample (Table 1). These data clearly suggest a decrease in crystallite size with increasing Nb content.

The qualitative phase composition of the 700 °C calcination series obtained from the XRD studies is clearly confirmed by Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 4). It is known that the most characteristic and strongest band of anatase appears at 151 cm−1, and that weaker bands can be detected at 639, 515, 400, and 204 cm−1, whereas the Raman bands of the rutile phase can be observed at 612, 448, 240, and 147 cm−1.45 In all spectra the detected bands can be clearly assigned to the anatase phase. Three weak bands in the 200–400 cm−1 region of the Ti0.95Nb0.05 and Ti0.9Nb0.1 samples are likely due to the presence of β-TiO2. Bands of niobia phases are not observed indicating that there is no phase separation or formation of NbOx islands on the surface of TiO2 particles. Similar changes in crystallite size and cell parameters with bulk composition are observed for the spray-dried precursors calcined at 800 °C. While a large quantity of Ti1-800 is converted into the rutile phase, the degree of conversion decreases with increasing Nb content.

Fig. 5 shows the XRD results of the Ti0.5Nb0.5 and Nb1 reference samples. The Nb1 sample is fully converted into Nb2O5 at both calcination temperatures. The diffraction patterns show sharp diffraction peaks suggesting that these are highly crystalline samples. Detailed analysis of the XRD pattern of the Ti0.5Nb0.5 sample reveals the presence of anatase and rutile, of TiNb2O7 oxide, and of a minor amount of Nb2O5. At lower calcination temperature the diffraction peaks of the mixed oxide TiNb2O7 are rather weak, and sharp well-defined peaks of the anatase and rutile phases can be detected. When increasing the calcination temperature to 800 °C, a highly crystalline TiNb2O7 oxide phase is observed. The poor crystallinity of the TiNb2O7 oxide in the Ti0.5Nb0.5-700 sample is in good agreement with the results and the interpretation of the TG-MS data demonstrating the decomposition of the pure Ti-precursor at lower temperatures and the decomposition of a mixed precursor at elevated temperatures. Arbiol et al.22 explained the phase separation at higher contents of Nb ions by the reduction of stress by removing Nb5+ ions from the lattice. However, the high rutile-to-anatase ratio cannot be explained only by removing Nb5+ ions from the lattice, as based on the data obtained with Ti1-700 sample, the anatase phase was expected to form exclusively. Possibly, the number of oxygen vacancies, which act as transformation centers is strongly increased compared to Ti1-700 after removing the Nb from the lattice, and, therefore, the anatase-to-rutile transformation is favored.22

Characterization of the texture by N2 physisorption and SEM
The obtained BET surface areas are summarized in Table 2. The surface area of the particles clearly increases with increasing Nb content, while it decreases with increasing calcination temperature. Thus, by varying the calcination temperature or the Nb content the surface area of the particles can be tuned from 40 to 140 m2 g−1. A mean particle diameter of the different powders can be calculated from the measured surface area values by assuming spherical particles (Table 2).

Based on this simple calculation, mean particle diameters of 15–60 nm were derived, which are in rather good agreement with the crystallite diameters obtained by XRD. It should be mentioned that the density of the anatase particles was used to calculate the mean particle size of the powders. The evolution of the pore size distribution of the samples calcined at 700 and 800 °C is presented in Fig. 6. The data are derived from the N2 physisorption experiments applying the BJH equation. The sample Ti1-700 shows two broad signals: smaller pores with a pore size maximum at 100 Å and a less intense signal in the range of 400–1000 Å can be observed. After treatment at 800 °C the peak detected at 100 Å disappears and the intensity of the other peak is significantly decreased. Obviously, even a small amount of Nb changes the pore size distribution and increases the number of smaller pores with a diameter of smaller than 200 Å. Further incorporation of Nb up to 10 at% led to even smaller pores. As shown in Fig. 6 the intensity of the maxima is changed by changing the calcination temperature. The presence of these small pores can be correlated with the formation of smaller particles. A change in the evolution of the pore size can be seen for the Nb0.5Ti0.5-800 sample, for which the pore diameter increases, while the overall number of pores decreases reflecting the trend of the N2 physisorption measurements. The characterization of the materials by means of SEM (ESI, Fig. S1†) revealed that the calcined materials consist of collapsed spherical particles. Because of the fast evaporation of the solvent, spray drying is known to lead to spherical particles, which may collapse during the calcination due to the volume contraction resulting from the decomposition of the precursors.30 Furthermore, the SEM studies did not indicate any significant influence of the Nb concentration on the morphology of the obtained particles, which were all found to be rather similar.

Probing the electronic structure by XPS and UV-Vis
The analysis of the XPS survey spectra (not shown) demonstrated that the sulfate ions had been removed completely from the sample surface by calcination at 700 °C, as no S 2p signal was detected. The XP spectra of the undoped and Nb-doped TiO2 powder samples prepared with different Nb contents (0, 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1), which were annealed at 700 °C, are shown in Fig. 7. Based on the peak positions, the differences of the Ti 2p3/2 and the Nb 3d5/2 binding energies and the line shapes, the presence of Ti4+ species with a Ti 2p3/2 binding energy of 458.3–458.5 eV and the presence of Nb5+ ions with a Nb 3d5/2 binding energy of 206.8 eV are clearly detected.24 Within the XPS information depth there is no evidence for Ti3+ species, which are usually observed at 1.8 eV lower binding energy than that of Ti4+.46 Furthermore, there is no evidence for the presence of Nb4+ species, which are normally observed at binding energies below 206.5 eV.15,47 By deriving the Nb:Ti atomic ratio from the Ti 2p3/2 and the Nb 3d5/2 peaks a slight enrichment of the Nb ions at the sample surface can be detected as shown in Fig. 7c.

It is well known that the doping of heteroatoms can change the band gap of TiO2. In Fig. 8 the results of the UV-Vis measurements of the undoped, the Ti0.995Nb0.005 and the Ti0.95Nb0.05 samples calcined at 600, 700, and 800 °C are shown. From these spectra the band gap values can be derived, and unoccupied electronic states can be detected. The measured band gap of the Ti1 samples amounts to 3.2 eV, which is in good agreement with reported values of the anatase modification. It shifts to 3.0 eV corresponding to the rutile modification when calcining at 800 °C. The band gap of the doped TiO2 sample is slightly shifted to lower values with increasing calcination temperature. The changes in the magnitude of the band gap can be explained by the different anatase-to-rutile ratios of the samples: the undoped sample was converted into the more stable rutile modification, whereas the degree of phase transformation of the doped sample is low due to the hindered phase transition. Therefore, the shift in the band gap is less pronounced. In the case of the samples calcined at 700 °C a slight blueshift of the adsorption edge of the low doped Ti0.995Nb0.005-700 sample and a slight redshift of the Ti0.95Nb0.05-700 sample compared with the adsorption edge of the undoped titania Ti1-700 are observed. It is important to mention that no additional electronic states giving rise to electronic transitions were found at higher wavelength for all samples.

Discussion
The characterization of the structural properties and the texture analysis of the synthesized powder materials are in good agreement. The XRD results show that the crystallite size of the materials as well as the particle size derived from BET measurements decrease with increasing Nb content. The differences in the XRD- and BET-derived crystallite sizes can be explained by agglomeration effects influencing the physisorption results. However, the trend in both cases is clearly maintained. The inhibition of grain growth and the hindered anatase to rutile phase transformation are in good agreement with other studies using sol–gel methods17,23 or laser-induced pyrolysis22 for the preparation of Nb-doped TiO2. The inhibition of grain growth is mostly explained by stress introduced into the lattice by the slightly larger Nb5+ ions,22,28 and the different phase transformation behavior is explained by the lower oxygen vacancy concentration acting as transformation centers.14,28 On the other hand, Pittman and Bell,48 who studied titania-supported niobia using Raman spectroscopy, pointed out that the formation of strong Nb–O–Ti bonds at the surface inhibits the Ti movement and hinders the phase transformation from anatase to rutile, because the Ti mobility is required to initiate the phase transformation.49 These Nb–O–Ti bonds are formed, when the surface of titania is covered by NbOx islands.48 However, in the present study it is not likely that amorphous NbOx islands are present on the surface of samples with low Nb content. This is clearly supported by the increase in the refined cell parameter with increasing Nb content and the absence of any feature in the XRD and Raman spectra, which can be found in the case of high Nb content. The increase in the cell parameters verifying Vegard's law is a strong hint for the effectiveness of doping as pointed out by Hirano and Matsushima.41 Combining the results of the XRD, Raman, and BET analysis, it is highly likely that Nb is incorporated in the lattice of TiO2. Thus, using the simple spray drying approach, Ti ions are substituted by Nb ions at low doping levels, and solid solutions are formed.
The chemical oxidation state of Nb derived by the XPS measurements is 5+. This is in good agreement with other studies using sol–gel methods28,49 or other preparation procedures.11,22 Furthermore, the XPS analysis did not reveal any evidence of Ti3+, and the UV-Vis measurements did not show any additional absorption. It is therefore reasonable to assume that charge compensation is achieved by the formation of Ti vacancies according to eqn (2).
The blueshift of the absorption edge of the Ti0.995Nb0.005-700 is in good agreement with previous studies on Nb-doped TiO2. Density functional theory calculations of the electronic structure of the pure and the Nb-doped anatase by Liu et al.50 showed that the difference between the top of the valence band and the Fermi level is larger in doped samples. As a result, the electron transition from the valence band to the conduction band requires more energy, which is clearly consistent with the observed blueshift in the UV-Vis spectra. Furthermore, Chandiran et al.42 recently observed a similar blueshift of the absorption edge in low content Nb-doped TiO2. They ascribed this blueshift to the Burstein–Moss effect, and the higher visible light transparency and enhanced charge collection efficiency resulted in an increase in power conversion in dye-sensitized solar cells.42 A redshift in higher doped samples was measured by Lüet al.19 They used Nb-doped TiO2 with loadings above 2.5 mol% Nb to enhance the performance of the photoanode in a dye-sensitized solar cell and observed a small redshift of the adsorption edge upon Nb doping, which is in agreement with our measurements. However, the redshift in the higher doped Ti0.95Nb0.05-700 may also be ascribed to the presence of the β-TiO2 phase, which was detected by XRD and Raman measurements.
Finally, the advantages of the spray drying process compared to the conventional methods have to be addressed. Ruiz et al.49 studied solid solutions of NbxTi1−xO2 prepared by a sol–gel method with a Nb content of 0 < x < 0.1 and found that the solubility limit of Nb in the anatase phase is higher than 0.1. However, the XPS analysis revealed that there is a large discrepancy between the concentration of Nb at the surface and the theoretical loading. Even at low calcination temperature the measured surface concentration was two times higher than the theoretical loading. Similar discrepancies between theoretical loading and surface concentration were found by Chandiran et al.,42 who used a rather complicated hydrothermal process and subsequent annealing treatment to synthesize Nb-doped TiO2 materials. Even though there is also a minor discrepancy between the theoretical Nb content and the actual amount of Nb in the near-surface region detected by XPS, it should be pointed out that the surface segregation is much less pronounced, and at calcination temperatures of 700 °C and a theoretical Nb content of 10 at% the detectable amount of Nb at the surface is less than 15%. Thus, more Nb should remain in the bulk of the material effectively doping the titania particles. The differences in segregation behavior are assumed to be due to the rapid evaporation in the spray drying process compared to the slow gelation process in the sol–gel approach. Furthermore, XRD and Raman results provide evidence that there is no additional phase, and it is not likely that NbOx islands are present on the surface of the material. Hence, Nb is well distributed in the bulk of the spray-dried materials.
In summary, spray drying is considered an efficient and advantageous synthetic method leading to high levels of Nb doping in TiO2. Future work focuses on the development of more suitable precursor molecules and the photocatalytic properties.
Conclusions

Spray drying was applied as an efficient, scalable and reliable method for the synthesis of doped metal oxides using Nb-doped TiO2 as a test system. The suppression of the ion mobility by the fast evaporation of water during the spray drying process is assumed to favor the homogeneous distribution of the Nb ions. The subsequent calcination in the temperature range from 600 to 800 °C results in crystalline materials with narrow pore size distributions. Subsequent to calcination, the fully oxidized Nb ions were found to be homogenously distributed in the crystalline TiO2 powder materials, and Nb surface segregation had occurred only to a minor extent in spite of the high-temperature treatment. By using different levels of Nb doping, the particle size and the anatase-to-rutile ratio can be easily adjusted: with increasing Nb content up to Ti0.9Nb0.1 the particle size decreases continuously, and the transformation of anatase into rutile at high temperatures is more kinetically hindered. The spray drying approach combined with a controlled high-temperature calcination is considered a promising technique for the homogeneous doping of TiO2 and other oxides with various metal ions.
