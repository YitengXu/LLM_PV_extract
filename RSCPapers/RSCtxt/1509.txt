    , Accepted 22nd June 2015First published on 23rd June 2015AbstractA low band gap donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymer PTBTBDT, namely, poly(2-dodecyl-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole-alt-4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene), was designed and synthesized via a Pd-catalyzed Stille polycondensation reaction. The polymer was characterized using 1H NMR spectroscopy, UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). PTBTBDT has good solubility in common organic solvents, good thermal stability, broad absorption, low band gap and exhibits not only high hole mobility but also moderate photovoltaic properties. PTBTBDT displays broad absorption in the wavelength range from 300 nm to 630 nm, and its HOMO and LUMO energy levels were calculated to be −4.98 eV and −3.34 eV, respectively. Bulk heterojunction solar cells were fabricated using PTBTBDT as the electron donor and PC70BM as the acceptor. The device exhibits a power conversion efficiency of 2.12% with a current density of 5.45 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 0.72 V, and a fill factor of 54% under the illumination of AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2. Under similar device fabrication conditions, the PTBTBDT based device showed considerably improved efficiency among its previously synthesized counterparts, i.e. PBDTDTBTz and PBDTBTz based devices, which have 1.7% and 1.4% efficiencies, respectively. The hole mobility of the PTBTBDT:PC70BM (1:2 w/w) blend reached up to 1.47 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 as calculated by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. By side-chain engineering, this study demonstrates a good example of tuning the absorption range, energy level, charge transport, and photovoltaic properties of polymers.
Introduction
Conducting polymers have received considerable interest as active materials for organic photovoltaics (OPVs),1,2 organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs),3,4 organic field effect transistors (OFETs),5,6 and electrochromic devices (ECDs).7–9 Due to the unique advantages of polymer solar cells (PSCs), such as low cost, solution processability, and application to flexible substrates, there is a growing interest towards the development of novel materials for polymer solar cell (PSC) applications.10–14 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9% for the single junction architecture15–17 was improved to 10.6% with tandem cells.18 These results have been achieved with the development of novel donor acceptor moieties together with device processing innovations.16,19–23 Recent research has focused on the development of new materials and morphology control of the active layer. Ideal polymers should have a broad absorption spectrum for the enhancement of sunlight harvesting, appropriate HOMO and LUMO levels for high open circuit voltages (Voc) (and efficient charge separation) and high hole mobility. Apart from optical and electronic properties, polymer PCBM blends should form an interpenetrated network morphology on the nanoscale.24 In order to improve the performance of PSCs, the synthetic versatility of organic chemistry is used for the development of novel materials. Over the past several years, 4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) has been incorporated in polymer backbones extensively as the donor unit. Since the first introduction of the BDT unit, it has been coupled with thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT),25,26 dithiophene-2-yl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT),27 thieno [3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD)28–30 and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) to form copolymers.31 The BDT unit offers several advantages such as strong electron donating ability, large planar structure providing high hole mobility and strong intramolecular charge transfer.32–36 Therefore, in this study, 4,8-bis(2-alkoxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) was incorporated in a benzotriazole (BTZ) and thiophene bearing polymer backbone due to its aforementioned properties. Previously, Zou et al. reported BTZ and BTD containing polymers with the highest PCE of 1.7%.37 In this work, the electrochemical, optical and photovoltaic properties of PTBTBDT were investigated.

Ltd and were used without further purification. PC70BM was obtained from Solenne. All reactions were carried out under an argon atmosphere unless otherwise mentioned. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was freshly distilled over Na/benzophenone ketyl. Tributyl(thiophene-2-yl)stannane, 2-dodecylbenzotriazole and 2-dodecyl-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (TBT) were synthesized according to previously described methods.38
Characterization
For cyclic voltammetry studies, the polymer was dissolved in CHCl3 (5 mg ml−1) and spray coated onto an ITO coated glass substrate using an Omni spray coating gun. The polymer thickness was less than a micron in order to be able to study its electrochromic properties. A three electrode system was constructed in which the ITO substrate was used as the working electrode, Pt wire as the counter electrode and Ag wire as the reference electrode, which was calibrated against an Fc/Fc+ reference electrode. Ferrocene was purchased from Aldrich and was used without any purification. 0.1 M TBAPF6 was used as the supporting electrolyte. For the spectroelectrochemical studies, the polymer film was coated on the ITO electrode and dipped into a monomer free solution. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker SpectroSpin Avance DPX-400 spectrometer with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal reference; chemical shifts were recorded in ppm. UV-vis spectra were recorded using a Varian Cary 5000 UV-vis spectrophotometer at room temperature. Cyclic voltammetry studies were carried out in a solution of 0.1 M of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate in anhydrous acetonitrile (ACN) solution at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. A Gamry 600 potentiostat was used with a three-electrode cell consisting of an ITO-coated glass substrate as the working electrode, Pt wire as the counter electrode, and Ag wire as the reference electrode, which was calibrated against Fc/Fc+ (0.3 V). HOMO and LUMO energy levels were calculated from the onset oxidation and onset reduction potentials. The molecular weight and polydispersity index of the polymer was determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis.
Fabrication and characterization of organic solar cell
ITO glass substrates were purchased from Visiontek Systems. The ITO glass substrates were etched with acid solution and sonicated for 15 minutes with detergent, distilled water, acetone, and isopropanol. Oxygen plasma cleaning was performed to remove organic impurities from the ITO surface. A poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT-PSS) solution was spin-coated on the cleaned ITO surface with a thickness of 40 nm. The substrates were heated for 10 minutes at 150 °C to remove residual water. Polymer PC70BM blends were prepared at different weight ratios and spin-coated under a N2 atmosphere. Cathode materials (0.8 nm LiF and 100 nm Al) were thermally evaporated with an average rate of 0.08 and 1 Å s−1 in a glove box. J–V curves were recorded with a Keithley 2400 source meter under the simulated AM 1.5 G illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The incident photon to current efficiencies (IPCE) of the solar cells were recorded using an Oriel quantum efficiency measurement system.

Polymer synthesis and characterization
The synthetic route toward the monomer and polymer is shown in Scheme 1. 4,7-Dibromo-2-dodecyl-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (2) was synthesized according to reported procedures in literature.39 Compound 2 was coupled with compound 1 via Stille coupling to obtain 2-dodecyl-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (3). Then, the bromination of compound (3) was performed in the presence of N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) and CHCl3 to give compound (4). The Stille polymerization between 2,6-bis(trimethyl-stannyl)-4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene and monomer (4) in the presence of bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) dichloride afforded the copolymer PTBTBDT. Soxhlet extraction was performed with methanol, hexane, and acetone to remove any residual catalyst. After extraction with several organic solvents, the polymer was precipitated in cold methanol. The resulting polymer has superior solubility in organic solvents such as chloroform, dichlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene due to the presence of alkyl chains on the polymer backbone. The molecular weight of the polymer was determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using CHCl3 as the eluent and polystyrene standards as the reference. The number average molecular weight (Mn) and weight average molecular weight (Mw) of the polymer was determined to be 34 kDa and 42 kDa, respectively, with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.2. The thermal property of PTBTBDT was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The polymer showed no degradation up to 300 °C with a 65% loss at 500 °C. This thermal behaviour is good enough for organic photovoltaic applications.

Results and discussion
Electrochemical and optical properties
Cyclic voltammetry studies were performed in order to investigate the redox properties of PTBTBDT. The polymer was spray coated on an ITO glass electrode and single scan cyclic voltammetry of the polymer was performed in the potential range between −1.60 and 1.20 V. Because the polymer has ambipolar (both p and n dopable) character, its HOMO and LUMO energy levels were calculated from the onset of the oxidation of the p-doping state and the onset of the reduction of the n-doping state, respectively. The cyclic voltammogram of the polymer is shown in Fig. 1(a). The onset of oxidation at the p-doping state is 0.53 V and the onset of reduction at the n-doping state is −1.11 V. From eqn (1), the HOMO–LUMO energy levels were found to be −4.98 eV and −3.34 eV, respectively, and the electronic band gap was found to be 1.6 eV, which is the difference between the HOMO and LUMO energy levels. A relatively low HOMO energy level is beneficial to obtain a high open circuit voltage (Voc) value, because the Voc is proportional to the difference between the LUMO of the acceptor and the HOMO of the donor. Table 1 summarizes the optoelectronic properties of the polymer and Fig. 2 shows the energy level diagram of the organic solar cell device constructed.HOMO = −(Eox, onset + 4.75 − 0.30) eV LUMO = −(Ered, onset + 4.75 − 0.30) eV(1)

The optical properties of the copolymer were investigated in a thin film and as an o-DCB solution [Fig. 1(b)]. The polymer has a strong absorption between 300 nm and 630 nm. The maximum absorption peaks in solution and in thin film are located at 473/510 nm and 493/530 nm, respectively. Due to the planarity effect of the π-conjugated polymer backbone in the solid state and enhanced intermolecular interactions between the polymer main chains,40 a 20 nm red shift was observed in the UV-vis absorption spectra. The optical band gap of the polymer (Eoptg) was calculated from the absorption spectra according to the equation Eoptg = 1241/ λ. The Eoptg was calculated to be 1.9 eV (Fig. 3).

Spectroelectrochemical studies
In order to investigate the electronic transitions and optical changes upon doping, the benzotriazole bearing copolymer (PTBTBDT) was subjected to an incrementally increasing applied potential while its UV-vis spectra were recorded. The polymer film was coated on the ITO electrode and dipped into a monomer free solution of 0.1 M TBAPF6/ACN. The polymer has the electrochromic characteristic of reversible color change upon applied potential. As shown in Fig. 3, an absorption band was observed at around 500 nm for the copolymer film in the neutral state, which corresponded to the π–π* inter band transition. When the applied potential was increased, the absorption of the π–π* transition decreased; moreover, new absorption bands started to appear at around 700 nm and 1370 nm. The formation of these new bands are observed at longer wavelengths due to the formation of polaronic and bipolaronic charge carriers on the polymer backbone.
Kinetic studies were performed to determine the switching times and percent transmittance changes (ΔT%) of the polymer. The switching time is the time between the colored and bleached states of the electrochromic material at a 95% contrast value. The measurement was done between the neutral and fully oxidized states of the polymers with 5 s time intervals. As shown in Fig. 4, the copolymer film revealed 18% optical contrast with a switching time of 0.4 s at 500 nm, 14% optic contrast with a switching time of 0.5 s at 700 nm and 36% optical contrast with a 0.4 s switching time at 1370 nm.

Photovoltaic properties
In order to investigate the photovoltaic properties of the polymer, bulk heterojunction solar cells were fabricated with the device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (Clevios) (40 nm)/polymer:PC70BM/LiF (0.8 nm)/Al (100 nm). The performance of PTBTBDT based devices was optimized by the ratio of the donor and acceptor, spin coating speed (thickness of the active layer), thermal annealing treatment and addition of an additive. Because organic solar cell applications highly depend on solubility and film formation of the polymer fullerene blend, the optimization of solvent is a crucial step in organic solar cell applications.41 In this context, dissolving the polymer and PC70BM in o-DCB resulted in the best morphology. PC70BM was preferred as the acceptor to enhance the absorption of blend due to the broad absorption range of PC70BM in the visible region. The current density/voltage (J/V) characteristics of the optimized OSCs are shown in Fig. 5(a). The best performance was obtained with the device constructed from a 1:2 polymer:PC70BM ratio. As summarized in Table 2, increasing the PC70BM ratio from 1:1 to 1:2 improved the charge transport and as a result power conversion efficiency (PCE) was enhanced.42 However, increasing the PC70BM ratio from 1:2 to 1:3 decreased the short circuit current (Jsc) due to the lower contribution of the polymer to absorption. Moreover, it decreased the hole transport ability of the active layer.43 Thereby, the optimum ratio was found to be 1:2 for polymer:PCB70M. In addition to this, the active layer thickness should be optimized to balance the absorption and charge transport. Moreover, the absorption of sunlight is enhanced as the thickness of the active layer increases, which in return results in higher charge production. On the other hand, the active layer thickness is limited to a few hundred nanometers due to the low diffusion lengths of organic materials, which are around 10–20 nm.44 The optimum active layer thickness was found to be 116 nm, which was determined by AFM (atomic force microscopy) (Fig. 6a and b). PSCs showed the highest photovoltaic performance of 2.12% with a Voc of 0.72 V, Jsc of 5.40 mA cm−2 and FF (fill factor) of 54%.

Pre and post annealing treatments, and addition of an additive can be carried out to improve the morphology of the active layer.45–51 In this study, pre-annealing treatments were carried out to increase device performance. Active layer coated ITO substrates were annealed at different temperatures for different time periods. However, the power conversion efficiency decreased from 2.12% to 1.53%. To investigate the pre-annealing treatment effect on morphology, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were carried out. Due to the higher electron density of PC70BM compared to the polymer, the dark areas correspond to PC70BM domains in TEM images. As depicted in Fig. 6c and d, the nanoscale morphology was adversely affected with thermal annealing. The Jsc value also decreased from 5.45 mA cm−2 to 3.37 mA cm−2 due to the formation of a less interconnected donor–acceptor network upon annealing.46 According to AFM results (Fig. 6a and b), the blend film root mean square roughness (Rms) were determined to be 6.79 nm and 6.47 nm. For further optimization, the addition of 1% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) to the polymer PCBM blend did not cause any improvement on PCE. Incident photon to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed and a 40% IPCE was obtained with the device showing the highest PCE% (Fig. 5b). The external quantum efficiencies of the PTBTBDT based devices as a function of wavelength from 350 nm to 750 nm matches well with the UV-vis absorbance range of the polymer PC70BM blend.
Two benzotriazole-based polymers, PBDTDTBTz and PBDTBTz, were previously synthesized by Zou et al. The photovoltaic devices based on these polymers demonstrated a power conversion efficiency of 1.7% and 1.4% for PBDTDTBTz and PBDTBTz, respectively, under the illumination of AM 1.5, 100 mW cm2. In our work, PTBTBDT comprising a thiophene unit as a π bridge revealed a power conversion efficiency of 2.12%, which is higher than previously synthesized polymer based photovoltaic devices. The absorption edges of the previously synthesized polymers were at 625 nm and 635 nm and the band gaps were determined to be 2.0 eV and 1.95 eV.37 For PTBTBDT, the absorption edge is at 653 nm with the band gap of 1.9 eV. The lower band gap of this polymer resulted from the red shift in the absorption. PTBTBDT can harvest more visible light due to its higher absorption edge.
Hole mobility
The charge carrier mobility of the polymer was investigated using the space charge limited current (SCLC) theory (Fig. 7). This is related with the current density–voltage characteristics (J–V curve) in the dark. The J–V curve follows Child’s law: (2)where L is the thickness of the polymer, V is the applied voltage, l is the carrier mobility, εr (3 for polymer) is the relative permittivity and εo is the permittivity of free space. Fig. 7 shows the logJ vs. logV plots with different active layer thicknesses of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Polymer:PCBM/LiF/Al solar cells in the dark. The hole mobilities were calculated using eqn (2) and are summarized in Table 2.

Conclusion
A benzodithiophene based new donor–acceptor type alternating copolymer was synthesized via a palladium-catalyzed Stille coupling reaction. The polymer exhibits good electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical properties, good solubility in common organic solvents, high thermal stability up to 300 °C and broad absorption from 300 nm to 630 nm. Bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells with PTBTBDT as the active layer were fabricated and optimized systematically. The organic solar cell device based on PTBTBDT:PC70BM (1:2, w/w) exhibited the best PCE of 2.12% with a Voc of 0.72 V, a Jsc value of 5.45 mA cm−2, and a FF of 54% under the illumination of AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2. The hole mobility of the polymer was estimated using the space charge limited current (SCLC) model and was calculated as 1.47 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The hole mobility results are consistent with the PCE of the PTBTBDT based photovoltaic device. The results indicate that the synthesized polymer is a promising donor for organic photovoltaics.
