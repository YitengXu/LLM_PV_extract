    , Accepted 6th February 2015First published on 9th February 2015AbstractBy adopting a series of donor–acceptor (D–A) polymers containing Benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) with different numbers of alkyl aromatic side-chains, we demonstrate a high optimized PCE of 4.35% for all-polymer solar cells by incorporating an n-type polymer N2200. Through systematic characterization of tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM), 2-dimensional grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (2d-GIXD), photoluminescence spectra and peak force-kelvin probe force microscopy (PF-KPFM), we have shown that the introduction of alkyl aromatic side chains to the donor polymer backbone is beneficial for the intermolecular π–π stacking and hence improves the polymer crystallinity as well as hole mobility. More importantly, we discovered that conjugated side-chains and additives can work synergistically to restore the intermolecular stacking of donor–acceptor polymers in the as-cast amorphous blend film and meanwhile develop fine phase segregation for efficient exciton dissociation and transport. As a result, the donor polymer PTP8 with fully alkyl aromatic side chains demonstrated an improved short-circuit current density (Jsc), a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of ∼1.00 V and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.35% after the addition of 0.5% DIO, which is among the highest reported efficiencies for all polymer solar cells.
1. Introduction
Solution-processed polymer/fullerene solar cells (PSCs) have attracted tremendous interest in the past decade because of their advantages like light-weight, mechanical flexibility and semi-transparency.1 However, fullerene derivatives demonstrate weak absorbance in the visible region and tendency to aggregate under elevated temperatures, leading to inefficient photon harvest as well as deteriorated blend morphology and consequently a reduced lifetime of PSCs.2 By replacing fullerene with an electron-accepting polymer, all-polymer solar cells can overcome the drawbacks of fullerenes such as tedious purification, chemical and electronic diversities3 alone with limited light absorption and poor thermal stability.
All-polymer photovoltaic devices, in which the active layer is composed of both an electron-donating polymer and an electron-accepting polymer, have lagged significantly behind the polymer/fullerene system in development and performance.3d Fortunately, the latest endeavors in selecting new donor–acceptor polymers and improving the device fabrication process have boosted the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of all-polymer devices to over 4%,4,5 Quite recently, Ito et al.5a have reported a record efficiency of 5.7% by carefully choosing an efficient donor–acceptor (D–A) polymer pair. On the other hand, the development of non-fullerene solar cells based on small molecule acceptors has boosted the efficiency to over 6%.3e–f Among the polymer acceptors exploited so far, naphthalene- and perylene tetracarboxylic diimide (NDI and PDI)-based derivatives are the most frequently reported ones due to their simple synthesis, easy-to-tune energy levels, and relatively high electron mobilities.6 The efforts to achieve high performance all-polymer solar cells were thus mainly focused on the improvement of device processing conditions and selection of donor polymers to obtain optimal miscibility, morphology, energy level alignment and balanced carrier mobility.4,5 The current device performance is believed to be hindered by limited charge separation or charge transport in the all-polymer film, depending on the specific polymer D/A combination. Thus to further improve the device performance, the effect of polymer structures and processing conditions on the device morphology and performance should be investigated and a more general designing approach would be desired to obtain an ideal donor–polymer.
In this contribution, a series of low band-gap donor polymers (P8, PT8, and PTP8) sharing the same backbone were used together with poly{[N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)}[P(NDI2OD-T2)); Polyera ActivInk N2200] in all-polymer solar cells. As shown in Scheme 1, P8 has flexible side chains on both donor and acceptor comonomers. PT8 has conjugated side chains appended to the donor comonomer while both alkyl aromatic side chains for PTP8. The correlation between the side chain structure and device performance was systematically studied. We reported a high open circuit voltage (Voc = ∼1.0 V) and PCE of 4.35% for the PTP8 device after the addition of 0.5% (v/v) 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), which is among the highest reported efficiencies for all-polymer PSCs. We found that the introduction of a conjugated side chain can enhance polymer intermolecular π–π interaction as well as crystallinity and may improve the effect of solvent additives, leading to improved morphology and carrier transport in the all-polymer blend, as proved by 2-dimensional grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (2D-GIXD). We also show that the surface conditions can be adjusted by the solvent additive by using Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) characterization. Our results suggest that the synergistic effect between the polymer side-chain and solvent additive is critical for the device improvement, which may become a general and effective approach to enhance the performance of current all-polymer solar cells.

2. Experimental section
2.1 General
UV-vis-NIR spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer model Lambda 750. Photoluminescence spectra were recorded on a Horiba Jobin Yvon model FL-TCSPC. Tapping-mode AFM images were obtained with a Veeco Multimode V instrument, 2-D GIXD experiments were conducted at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) on a diffraction beam line (BL14B1). PF-KPFM measurements were performed with a Burker Dimension Icon instrument. NDI2OD-Br2 and 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)-thieno-[3,2-b]-thiophene were purchased from Sunatech Inc. tri(o-tolyl)phosphine and Pd2(dba)3 were purchased from Strem Chemicals Inc. Toluene and DMF were purchased from Adamas Reagent. Ltd and distilled before use.
2.2 Synthesis of polymers N2200
N2200 was synthesized according to the procedures as follows: in a 50 mL reaction tube, NDI2OD-Br2 (200 mg, 0.21 mmol), 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)-thieno-[3,2-b]-thiophene (95 mg, 0.21 mmol), tri(o-tolyl)phosphine (0.02 g, 0.08 mmol), and Pd2(dba)3 (0.01 g, 0.01 mmol) were dissolved in 5 mL dry toluene and 0.5 mL DMF under argon. After being stirred at 110 °C for 4 days, the mixture was cooled to room temperature and precipitated in methanol (80 mL). The precipitate was filtered and washed with acetone (24 h) and hexane (24 h) successively in a soxhlet apparatus to remove oligomers and catalyst residue. Finally, the polymer was extracted with chloroform (6 h). The chloroform fraction was concentrated and precipitated in methanol. The precipitate was filtered and dried in a vacuum at 80 °C overnight. GPC: Mn = 36.0 kg mol−1, PDI = 2.5.
2.3 Device fabrication and testing
Polymer solar cells were fabricated with a general structure of ITO/PEDOT-PSS (40 nm)/polymer:N2200/LiF/Al. Patterned ITO glass substrates were cleaned by sequential ultrasonic treatment in detergent, acetone, deionized water and isopropyl alcohol. The organic residue was further removed by treating with UV-ozone for 10 min. A thin film of PEDOT:PSS (∼40 nm) was spin-coated on ITO substrates and dried at 150 °C for 10 min. A blend of polymers with different ratios was dissolved in chloroform or chloroform containing 0–5% (v/v) diiodooctane, spin-coated at varying speeds (1000–3500 rpm) for 40 s, 0.6 nm of LiF (0.1 A s−1) and 100 nm Al (2 A s−1) layers were then thermally evaporated on the active layer at a pressure of 1.0 × 10−6 mbar through a shadow mask (active area 7.25 mm2). The current density–voltage characteristics of the photovoltaic cells were measured using a Keithley 2400 (I–V) digital source meter under a simulated AM 1.5 G solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 (Newport, Class AAA solar simulator, 94023A-U). The light intensity is calibrated using a certified Oriel Reference Cell (91150V) and verified with a NREL calibrated Hamamatsu S1787-04 diode. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was determined using a certified IPCE equipment (Zolix Instruments, Inc, SolarCellScan100).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Polymer synthesis and properties
The donor polymers P8, PT8 and PTP8 were synthesized following our previous report.7 N2200 was synthesized using an improved procedure8 as described in the Experimental section. The molecular structures and energy levels of donor and acceptor polymers are shown in Scheme 1. Despite the modification of side-chains, the LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) and HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) levels of the donor polymers are all around −3.60 eV and −5.50 eV respectively,7b which help to form a type II structure with the acceptor polymer N2200, as well as achieve a high open circuit voltage (Voc). The normalized film absorption spectra of the adopted polymers are shown in Fig. 1. The donor polymers exhibit a similar absorption and a bandgap around 1.8 eV, likely due to their BDT-TPD based backbone structure. The absorption of N2200 is broader and the donor–acceptor blend absorption can be extended to over 900 nm, consequently increasing the photon harvested by the all-polymer photovoltaic devices.

3.2 All-polymer solar cell performance
All-polymer devices were fabricated with the conventional architecture of ITO/PEDOT-PSS(40 nm)/Polymer:N2200/LiF(0.6 nm)/Al(100 nm), as shown in Fig. 2a. Throughout the experiment, a fixed D/A polymer concentration of 12 mg mL−1 was adopted, with chloroform as the optimal processing solvent. The device optimization includes fine adjustment of the film thickness, blend ratio (Table S1†) and additive concentration (Table 1). 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was used in this work to improve the film morphology,9 which has been proven to be an efficient additive in polymer–fullerenes as well as in non-fullerene solar cells.4a,6b The J–V characteristics of the optimized devices for different donor polymers are shown in Fig. 2, with the detailed parameters listed in Table S2.† All the devices exhibit a high Voc around 1.00 V. Optimized PCEs of 1.52%, 1.75% and 4.35% are achieved for P8, PT8 and PTP8, respectively. The PCE difference can mainly be ascribed to their different Jsc and FF. The mobility of the polymer:N2200 blend film was measured by using a space charge limited current (SCLC) technique.10 A device structure of ITO//PEDOT-PSS(40 nm)/Polymer:N2200/MoOx (6 nm)/Al (100 nm) was adopted and the results are shown in Fig. S1.† The calculated hole mobility is 6.12 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, 7.52 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, and 4.78 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the films of P8:N2200, PT8:N220 and PTP8:N2200 respectively, which is in accordance with their FF. The higher mobility of PTP8 and PT8 compared to P8 can be ascribed to their enhanced intermolecular packing assisted by alkyl aromatic side-chains. As shown in Fig. 3, the photoluminescence of all three donor polymers are effectively quenched by the acceptor polymer. The lifetime of excited excitons is also apparently reduced when blended with N2200, which suggests an exciton dissociation process at the donor–acceptor interface. We observe that the addition of 0.5% (v/v) DIO can further reduce the exciton lifetime of all the blend films while the effect is more significant for polymers PT8 and PTP8 with conjugated side chains. This result is consistent with the observation that PTP8 and PT8 based devices are much more improved than P8 based devices after using DIO, as shown in Table S2.† It is worth noting that the addition of 2% DIO results in less efficient exciton separation, likely due to deteriorated morphology. We further studied the effect of DIO on the PTP8:N2200 based photovoltaic devices in detail, as shown in Fig. 4 and Table 1. The devices cast from pure chloroform solution exhibit a maximum PCE of 2.83% with a Jsc of 6.53 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.975 V, and a FF of 44.4%. After the addition of 0.5% (v/v) DIO, the devices achieve a significantly higher Jsc of 8.43 mA cm−2, a FF of 52.8% and a PCE of 4.35%. The improved morphology (Fig. S2†) and increased film absorbance after using DIO (Fig. 5) may account for the enhanced performance. A further increase in the amount of solvent additive, however, results in a gradual decrease of the device performance. PCEs of 3.88%, 3.27%, 2.82% and 1.64% were achieved for devices using 1.0%, 2.0%, 3.0% and 5.0% (v/v) DIO, respectively. We also evaluated the formation of carrier pathways at different DIO concentrations. The carrier mobility of the PTP8:N2200 blend film was measured by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) technique,10 with the results shown in Fig. S3 and Table S3.† With an increased additive concentration, a gradual decrease in both the electron and hole mobilities is observed, indicating unfavorable morphology for carrier transport in the all-polymer film. The electron and hole mobilities are high and balanced with 0.5% DIO which is consistent with the optimal FF under this processing condition. To evaluate the photo-response of PTP8 based devices and calibrate the Jsc data, external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of optimized devices with or without DIO were measured and are shown in Fig. 5. After using DIO, both the film absorbance and EQE are enhanced. The devices show a relatively high photo-conversion efficiency over the whole wavelength range (300–850 nm). Judged by the pick positions, we conclude that the increased absorption and current is mainly contributed by PTP8, likely due to improved packing by using DIO. However, N2200 also contributes to the EQE improvement in the 700–900 nm regions, suggesting overall enhancement of charge separation and transport in the blend film after using DIO. It is worth noting that the Jsc calculated by integrating the EQE curve with an AM1.5G reference spectrum is within ∼3% error compared to the corresponding Jsc obtained from the J–V curves.

3.3 All-polymer blend morphology
The surface morphology of the polymer:N2200 film with or without DIO was carefully investigated to understand the effect of additive by using tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 6, before the use of DIO, PTP8 and PT8 blend films have more pronounced polymer aggregation structures compared to the relatively uniform film of P8, which may arise from the enhanced molecular packing assisted by conjugated side chains. After the addition of 0.5% (v/v) DIO, the domains of the two polymers in the PTP8:N2200 film are more uniformly distributed, which may lead to enhanced exciton dissociation and is in accordance with the dramatically enhanced device performance and photoluminescence quenching after using DIO. The effect of DIO concentration on the morphology was further studied. As shown in Fig. S2,† increasing the amount of DIO from 0.5%, 1.0%, 2.0–3.0% for the PTP8:N2200 blend results in gradually increased surface roughness and domain sizes, leading to enhanced phase aggregation with a scale too large to effectively separate excitons. This observation is also consistent with the low device performance.

We also investigated the surface potentials of the blend films w/wo DIO by using Peak Force-Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (PF-KPFM).11 KPFM measures the contact potential difference between the tip and the blend film. The PF-KPFM surface potential images and the corresponding analysis curves of contact potential differences are shown in Fig. 7. According to the PF-KPFM measurements, the average contact surface potentials of the blend film casted from pure chloroform is found to be ∼0.3 V and ∼0.2 V higher than that of the films with 0.5% and 2.0% DIO additive, respectively. Thus the addition of DIO can substantially change the film surface conditions and lower the surface potential of the organic/metal interface. Compared to the blend film without the additive, the addition of 0.5% DIO dramatically reduces the vacuum level (VL) of the cathode side by ∼0.3 V and also leads to more uniform distribution of the surface potential, which may improve the electron extraction at the polymer/Al interface and result in enhanced device performance.11a

3.4 Molecular packing in the all-polymer bulk heterojunction blend
To gain insight into the mechanism of device improvement by introducing alkyl aromatic side-chains and additives, we further performed very detailed 2d-GIXD to reveal the corresponding bulk morphology change. In the scattering spectra of pristine PT8, PTP8 (Fig. S4†) and N2200 (Fig. 8), the (010) peak corresponding to π–π stacking is more pronounced in the out-of-plane direction, which suggests that majority of the polymer backbones are oriented parallel to the substrates,12 which is favorable for carrier transport cross the film to the electrode. The evidently stronger (010) peak of PTP8 and PT8 compared to P8 indicates enhanced intermolecular packing likely resulting from introduced conjugated side-chains. Note that N2200 also shows evident (100) and (200) peaks in the in-plane direction. The GIXD patterns of polymer:N2200 blend films cast from chloroform without DIO are also shown in Fig. S6.† We observe the weakening of (010) peaks for all polymer blends, suggesting the amorphous nature of the as-cast polymer blend film. After the addition of 0.5% DIO, however, the (010) peaks of PTP8 and PT8 are restored, while the scattering rings of the P8 blend are almost not enhanced. Thus we speculate that PTP8 and PT8 with conjugated side-chains can more effectively recover their intermolecular π–π stacking and carrier mobility with the aid of DIO, while P8 with alkyl side chains has a smaller conjugation area and less coplanarity, demonstrating weaker capability to restore intermolecular packing when using DIO. If we watch carefully, we can see that the (010) peak in the PT8 blend is slightly stronger than that of the PTP8 blend, which is actually in accordance with its AFM image in Fig. 6. It is worth noting that the (100) and (200) peaks of N2200 can be observed in PTP8 and PT8 blends. It indicates that N2200 can basically retain its order when blended with these two polymers, which is beneficial for maintaining efficient electron transport. Furthermore, we investigate the morphology evolution of the PTP8 blend with an increased DIO content (0–5%) (Fig. 8). The (100) peaks of both PTP8 and N2200 in the blend film exhibit no shift before and after the addition of DIO, indicating that no intercalated phases are formed in the PTP8:N2200 film.13 Without using DIO, the halo around 1.5 Å−1 corresponding to the polymer (010) peaks is very weak for the blend film. The peak is becoming more prominent with the increased DIO concentration and the reaches the maximum intensity at 0.5% (v/v) DIO. The (100) and (200) peaks of N2200 are also largely enhanced at a DIO concentration between 0.5% and 2%, with the maximum peak intensity and electron mobility obtained at about 1% DIO. The results suggest that the DIO concentration may impact the donor and acceptor polymer differently which requires further study to understand the mechanism. In Fig. 9, the one dimension line-cuts of both XY and Z axes are presented, exhibiting a DIO concentration-dependent diffraction intensity change for both the donor and the acceptor polymers, apparently, the all-polymer blend with the addition of 0.5% DIO demonstrated more pronounced diffraction peaks in both directions, and at higher DIO concentration, decreased diffraction intensity was witnessed from both axis. As a result, improved intermolecular packing for both donor and acceptor polymers can be achieved at 0.5% DIO. Consequently, balanced carrier transport and optimal efficiency are demonstrated. At higher DIO loadings, the (010) peak is gradually diminished. And all scattering peaks nearly disappear at a very high DIO concentration of 5%, indicating a totally amorphous blend film, which is in accordance with the relatively low efficiency and carrier mobility for devices with high concentration DIO.

4. Conclusions
By introducing different numbers of alkyl aromatic side chains to the donor polymers, the performance of all-polymer PSCs was greatly improved and an optimized PCE of 4.35% was obtained after the addition of 0.5% DIO, which is among the highest reported efficiencies for all polymer PSCs. The effect of alkyl aromatic side chains and solvent additives on the device morphology and performance was systematically studied. The introduction of conjugated side chains is beneficial to the intermolecular π–π stacking and hence improves the polymer crystallinity as well as the hole mobility. More importantly, we discovered that conjugated side-chains and DIO can work synergistically to restore the intermolecular stacking of donor–acceptor polymers in the as-cast amorphous blend film and meanwhile develop fine phase segregation for efficient exciton dissociation and transport. Although higher PCEs for all-polymer PSCs have been reported, our work may propose a more universal and facile designing method to tailor the existing polymers to achieve improved performance in all-polymer photovoltaic devices.

 	Fig. 3  Photoluminescence spectra of polymer:N2200 based blend films (a, c, and e); photoluminescence decay profiles of polymer:N2200 blend films (b, d, and f).	 

 	Fig. 4  
J–V curves of optimized all-polymer PSCs based on PTP8:N2200 with different DIO concentrations.	 

 	Fig. 5  EQE and blend absorption spectra of PTP8:N2200 cast from chloroform w/wo the solvent additive.	 

 	Fig. 6  AFM height images (5.0 μm × 5.0 μm) of polymer:N2200 blend films cast from chloroform w/wo 0.5% (v/v) DIO.	 

 	Fig. 7  the PF-KPFM surface potential images (5 μm × 5 μm) of PTP8:N2200 blend films and the analysis curves of the contact potential differences of the top surfaces for the blend films.	 

 	Fig. 8  GIXD patterns of pristine PTP8 and N2200 film cast from chloroform as well as PTP8:N2200 blend films cast from chloroform with varying DIO concentrations. Note that the 2D spectra have not been corrected for the “missing wedge” of data along the out-of-plane direction.
