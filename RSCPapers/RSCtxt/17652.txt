    , Accepted 11th November 2015First published on 12th November 2015AbstractA compact TiO2 layer is crucial to achieve high-efficiency perovskite solar cells. In this study, we developed a facile, low-cost and efficient method to fabricate a pinhole-free and ultrathin blocking layer based on highly crystallized TiO2 quantum dots (QDs) with an average diameter of 3.6 nm. The surface morphology of the blocking layer and the photoelectric performance of the perovskite solar cells were investigated by spin-coating with three different materials: colloidal TiO2 QDs, titanium precursor solution, and aqueous TiCl4. Among these three treatments, the perovskite solar cell based on the TiO2 QD compact layer offered the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.97% with a photocurrent density of 22.48 mA cm−2, a photovoltage of 1.063 V and a fill factor of 0.71. The enhancement of PCE mainly stems from the small series resistance and the large shunt resistance of the TiO2 QD layer.
1. Introduction
Recently, perovskite organic lead halides (e.g. CH3NH3PbX3 (X = I, Br, Cl)) have aroused much interest due to their applications for making transformative changes in thin film solar cells.1–7 The most-studied perovskite light absorbers are CH3NH3PbI38 and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx.9 The superb photovoltaic performances stem from their high light absorption, the long-range charge-transport properties and the low exciton binding energy.10 CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx are capable of transporting electrons and holes, where the diffusion length is about 130 nm for electrons and about 100 nm for holes in CH3NH3PbI3, and ca. 1069 nm for electrons and 1213 nm for holes in CH3NH3PbI3−xClx.11,12 Perovskite solar cells are generally composed of transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrates, a n-type compact blocking layer, a perovskite layer with or without a scaffold layer (e.g. TiO2, ZnO or Al2O3), a p-type hole-transporting material (HTM) layer and a metal back electrode. It is widely recognized that the properties of the blocking TiO2 layer are important.13 An ideal blocking TiO2 layer is expected to be ultrathin and pinhole-free. In general, the role of the blocking layer is to prevent direct electrical contact between the TCO and the hole transporting material (HTM), thus reducing charge recombination at this interface.14–16
Currently, the n-type compact blocking layer is usually composed of TiO2, which is mainly fabricated on a transparent conducting oxide substrate by spin-coating, spray pyrolysis and atomic layer deposition (ALD) using a titanium precursor solution. Spray pyrolysis was introduced in 1995 by Kavan and Gratzel,17 and now it is popular in perovskite solar cells as a spin-coating method. Also, Wu et al.18 reported a uniform compact TiO2 layer with a large shunt resistance (Rsh) using ALD which showed superior performance. However, ALD needs sophisticated facilities and complicated operations, and has high costs. Although simple, spray pyrolysis and spin-coating usually use a titanium precursor solution. Kim19 has proved that the compact layer prepared using a conventional titanium precursor solution possesses many residual organics and hydroxyl groups as shown by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectra. Residual organics and hydroxyl groups are considered as defects and affect the charge collection properties. Hence, a facile, low-cost and efficient approach to fabricate superb compact TiO2 blocking layers for perovskite solar cells is imperative.
Herein, the spin-coating approach and highly crystallized TiO2 quantum dots (QDs) were successfully combined together to fabricate a pinhole-free and ultrathin compact blocking layer for perovskite solar cells. Redispersible colloidal TiO2 quantum dots with an average diameter of 3.6 nm and high crystallinity were successfully synthesized via a solvothermal reaction. It has been demonstrated that QD materials such as PbS, CdS, and CdSe QDs can form pinhole-free and thickness-controllable compact layers using the spin-coating approach.20,21 Furthermore, the surface morphology of the blocking layer and the performance of the perovskite solar cells were investigated by spin-coating with three different materials: colloidal TiO2 quantum dots (QDs), titanium precursor solution, and aqueous TiCl4. The CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite was formed on a mesoporous TiO2 film using a two-step spin-coating method.22Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of the perovskite cell.

2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
All of the materials were purchased from the Sigma-Aldrich Corp., if not specified. The Spiro-OMeTAD was from Materwin New Material Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China).
2.2. Preparation of colloidal TiO2 quantum dots (QDs)
The TiO2 QDs with an average diameter of 3.6 ± 0.4 nm were synthesized via the facile solvothermal reaction reported by Wang et al.23 and Que et al.24 In a typical synthesis, 7 mL of oleic acid was added into 20 mL of hexanaphthene slowly with stirring at room temperature, followed by adding 5 mL of octadecylamine and 1 mL of tetra-n-butyl titanate, leading to a yellow solution. Then the mixture was added to a 50 mL autoclave and reacted at 180 °C for 24 h. After being cooled to room temperature, the products were then mixed with 200 mL of absolute ethanol and centrifuged to collect the precipitate. Finally, the as obtained product was re-dispersed in 24 mL of toluene, to obtain a stable colloidal TiO2 quantum dot solution.
2.3. Synthesis of CH3NH3I
CH3NH3I was synthesized according to a reported procedure.25 CH3NH2 (38 mL, 33% in absolute ethanol, Aldrich) and HI (40 mL, 57 wt% in water, Aldrich) were mixed at 0 °C and stirred for 2 h. The precipitate was recovered by evaporation at 50 °C for 1 h. The product was washed with diethyl ether three times and then dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h.
2.4. Preparation of the compact TiO2 blocking layer
Fluorine-doped tin oxide-coated (FTO) glass (Pilkington, TEC-8, 14 Ω sq−1) was patterned by etching with Zn powder and 2 M HCl diluted solution in deionized water and cleaned by UV-ozone treatment for 15 min, followed by cleaning with detergent and ethanol consecutively. The TiO2 compact blocking layers were deposited on FTO glass. The first kind of TiO2 compact layer is based on the as-prepared TiO2 QDs, termed QD-CL. The second kind of TiO2 compact layer is based on a titanium precursor solution, which was prepared by spin-coating 0.15 M titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75 wt% in isopropanol, Aldrich) in a 1-butanol (99.8%, Aldrich) solution, termed TAA-CL. The third kind of TiO2 compact layer is based on 0.2 M aqueous TiCl4, termed TiCl4-CL. To probe the effect of the compact layer thickness on the device performance, each of the three different materials was spun at 1000, 2000, 4000, and 6000 rpm for 30 s. Then they were annealed at 450 °C for 30 min.
2.5. Fabrication of perovskite solar cells
A mesoporous TiO2 film was deposited on the three kinds of TiO2 compact layer by spin-coating TiO2 paste diluted in ethanol. The TiO2 paste was prepared as described previously and the optimal ratio of ethyl cellulose/TiO2 in the TiO2 paste was carefully controlled.26–28 After drying at 100 °C for 5 min, the film was annealed at 450 °C for 30 min, providing a thickness of ∼200 nm. The mesoporous TiO2 film was immersed in a 0.02 M aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min. After washing with deionized water and alcohol, the film was heated at 500 °C for 30 min. CH3NH3PbI3 was formed using a two-step spin-coating procedure.22 PbI2 solution (1 M) was prepared by dissolving 462 mg of PbI2 (99%, Aldrich) in 1 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%, Aldrich) under stirring at 70 °C. PbI2 solution (20 μL) was spin-coated on the mesoporous TiO2 film at 3000 rpm for 5 s and 6000 rpm for 5 s (without loading time). After spinning, the film was dried at 40 °C for 3 min and then 100 °C for 5 min to remove the solvent, and after cooling to room temperature, 200 μl of 6.5 mg mL−1 CH3NH3I solution in 2-propanol was loaded onto the PbI2-coated substrate for 40 s (loading time), which was spun at 4000 rpm for 20 s and dried at room temperature for 10 min and 100 °C for 5 min. A volume of 20 μL of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) solution was spin-coated onto the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer at 5000 rpm for 30 s. A spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg of spiro-OMeTAD in 1 mL of chlorobenzene, to which 28.8 μL of 4-tert-butyl pyridine and 17.5 μL of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) solution (520 mg LI-TSFI in 1 mL acetonitrile, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%) were added. All devices were stored in a desiccator (humidity <20%) in the dark for 12 h. Finally, 80 nm of gold was deposited under vacuum through a shadow mask.
2.6. Characterization
The crystalline structures of the TiO2 QDs were examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker AXS, D8 Advance). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted using a JEOL-2010 TEM. The morphologies of the compact layers and the perovskite films were imaged using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800, Japan). Impedance spectra (IS) for the solar cell were measured on a ZAHNER IM6e electrochemical workstation under 1 sun AM 1.5 illumination, by applying a 0 V DC bias and a 5 mV voltage perturbation in the frequency range from 0.1 to 105 Hz. The impedance spectra were analyzed with Zview software. IPCE curves were measured as a function of wavelength from 300 nm to 800 nm using the Newport IPCE system (Newport, USA). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured using a Keithley 2401 source-measure unit under AM1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 provided by an Oriel Sol3A solar simulator in an ambient environment. The light intensity was adjusted using a NREL-calibrated Si solar cell equipped with a KG-2 filter. During the measurement, the photovoltaic devices were masked by a metal aperture to confine the active area (0.125 cm2).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Morphology and structure of the TiO2 QDs

Fig. 2(a) shows the low-magnification TEM image of the TiO2 QDs with an average diameter of 3.6 ± 0.4 nm, as shown in Fig. 2(b). To analyze the fringe patterns in a TiO2 QD, we further magnified the TEM image, as shown in Fig. 2(c). Clearly visible atomic lattice fringes can be seen in Fig. 2(c), suggesting high crystallinity. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern is shown in Fig. 2(d). The HRTEM image and SAED pattern reveal that the TiO2 QDs show polycrystalline phases of anatase TiO2 with a (101) interplanar space of 3.52 Å and a (001) interplanar space of 4.84 Å.29–31 The XRD pattern in Fig. 2(e) also shows a series of narrow diffraction peaks which correspond to the anatase structure (JCPDS #21-1272) without any other crystalline impurity phases and indicates high crystallinity. The digital photo of the colloidal TiO2 QDs in Fig. 2(f) reveals a stable and transparent colloid. The EDS graph in Fig. 2(g) and the atomic content in Table 1 of the TiO2 QDs show only Ti and O elements in the QDs (C elements stems from the carbon film on the copper net during the TEM test).

3.2. Optimized compact layer
To probe the effect of the blocking layer thickness on the device performance, each of the three different materials was spun at 1000, 2000, 4000, and 6000 rpm for 30 s. Table 2 shows the device parameters of the perovskite solar cells based on TiCl4-CL with different thicknesses (the cross-sectional SEM image is in Fig. S1†). In particular, due to the low saturated vapor pressure and the non volatile nature of the water solvent, it is difficult to obtain a uniform layer at low speeds, which can be seen from Fig. S1.†Table 3 shows the device parameters of the perovskite solar cells based on TAA-CL with different thicknesses (the cross-sectional SEM image is in Fig. S2†). Table 4 shows the photovoltaic parameters of the perovskite solar cells based on QD-CL with different thicknesses (the cross-sectional SEM image is in Fig. S3†). If too thick a compact layer was applied, the distance from the absorber to the FTO will be enlarged, producing more recombination centers. If too thin a compact layer was applied, the FTO will not be fully covered with the dense blocking layer since the surface of the FTO substrate is rough because of the F-doped SnO2 grains with sizes ranging from tens to hundreds of nanometers.32 Therefore, as the thickness of the TiO2 compact layer decreased, the performance of the solar cells first increased and then decreased. The optimal thickness of the three kinds of compact layer is about 50 nm. So we selected 4000 rpm as the optimal spin-coating speed to fabricate the compact layer.

Fig. 3 shows the surface morphology of the three compact TiO2 layers spun at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Fig. 3(a) is bare FTO. Fig. 3(b)–(d) are QD-CL, TAA-CL, and TiCl4-CL, respectively. As is shown in Fig. 3(a), the FTO substrate is rough because of the F-doped SnO2 grains with sizes ranging from tens to hundreds of nanometers. For the optimized compact layer, the surface morphology of the underlying FTO was reserved. For the QD-CL sample, highly crystallized TiO2 QDs with a size of 3.6 ± 0.4 nm were dispersed in toluene, and easily duplicated the surface morphology of the underlying FTO, except for the crevice caused by the very large F-doped SnO2 grains. It can be seen from the inset in Fig. 3(b) that the TiO2 particles are closely encapsulated on the SnO2 grains, which can afford a solid blocking effect.

3.3. Photovoltaic performance

J–V measurements of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on the three kinds of compact layers spun at 4000 rpm are shown in Fig. 4 and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 5. The corresponding incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the three devices are shown in Fig. 5. The PSCs with TiCl4-CL, TAA-CL and QD-CL exhibit power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 12.54%, 14.01% and 16.97%, respectively. To ensure the credibility of the results, a batch of three kinds of perovskite solar cells, containing 27 cells, was prepared and tested under the same conditions, and the statistic results are shown in Fig. S4.†

Fig. 6 is a top-view SEM image of the perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 film coated on the mesoporous TiO2 film. The cuboids’ average size is 700 nm. The larger-sized cuboids can afford a higher JSC due to light scattering and fewer grain boundaries.33 From Fig. 4 and Table 5, compared to the PSCs with TAA-CL and TiCl4-CL, the performance improvement for the PSC with TiO2 QD-CL mainly lies in the increase of the FF and the VOC.
 Fig. 6  Top-view SEM image of the perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 coated on the mesoporous TiO2 film. 
As is well known, the VOC and FF depend largely on the series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) values of the cells.13,34,35 Series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) values were estimated using the Keithley 2401 testing system and the results are summarized in Table 5. The Rsh values of the PSCs based on QD-CL, TAA-CL, and TiCl4-CL are 6404, 1640, and 955 Ω cm2, respectively. The Rs values of the PSCs based on QD-CL, TAA-CL, and TiCl4-CL are 5.5, 8.2, and 10.5 Ω cm2, respectively, and the order of the Rs values is further confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, Table S1†). Among them, the smallest Rs value for the device based on QD-CL stems from both the smaller contact resistance and the bulk resistance of QD-CL, which indicates that high photocurrents are anticipated to be generated. It is known that Rsh is closely related to the charge recombination at interfaces inside the solar cell. The largest Rsh value for the device based on QD-CL indicates that short circuits or current leakages are minimized.36 Higher Rsh and lower Rs values enable a larger FF and a high electron mobility.34 These results are in good agreement with the conclusion drawn by analyzing the solar cells’ performances.
As shown in Fig. 7, we used a simple model (equivalent circuit is shown in the inset) capable of producing a good fit to the experimental data.37 The radius of the impedance semi-circles corresponds to the internal resistance of the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 interface, the TiO2 layer itself and the FTO/TiO2 interface.38 The PSC with QD-CL exhibits the lowest ending resistance of the semicircles, indicating the smallest internal resistance among all of the different solar cells (the fitting parameters for the EIS data acquired under 1 sun illumination are shown in Table S1†). Therefore, the PSC with QD-CL possesses superior charge injection characteristics and low internal resistance. The difference in the charge collection properties is considered to be due to imperfections such as residual chemicals, hydroxyl groups, and Ti3+ ions.19

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, a pinhole-free and ultrathin blocking layer based on highly crystallized colloidal TiO2 quantum dots (QDs) with a size of 3.6 ± 0.4 nm is fabricated successfully by a facile, low-cost and efficient method. The best-performing perovskite solar cell, using a TiO2 QD compact layer, has achieved a PCE of 16.97% with a high VOC of 1.063 V, a high JSC of 22.48 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.71, much higher than those of our reference cells using a TAA compact layer and a TiCl4 compact layer. The outstanding performance of the perovskite solar cells based on the TiO2 QD compact layer stems from a small series resistance and a large shunt resistance and is confirmed by impedance spectroscopy. This study opens a new direction to fabricate a pinhole-free and ultrathin blocking layer and push the performance of organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells to a higher level.
