    , Accepted 9th May 2019First published on 9th May 2019AbstractMarked progress has been made in organometallic halide perovskite (OHP) solar cells, with their power conversion efficiency reaching up to 24.2% owing to the excellent optoelectronic properties such as high light absorption coefficients, long carrier diffusion lengths, and high carrier mobilities. Among the reported highly efficient devices, most were fabricated in a well-controlled inert environment. However, large-scale manufacturing requires ambient processing, which affects the crystallization process of OHP. Recently, considerable attention has been drawn to developing air-processed OHP solar cells, in terms of scientific understanding of the crystallization process and developing processes compatible with large volume manufacturing. This review article summarizes the recent progress made in air-processed OHP solar cells. Specifically, we focus on (1) the microscopic understanding of the impact of the ambient environment on the crystallization process of OHP composites, (2) the approaches to control the crystallization and morphology of OHP in ambient air, and (3) the fabrication processes to achieve highly efficient air-processed OHP solar cells. Finally, we will discuss the challenges and pathways toward commercialization of low-cost air-processed OHP solar cells.

1. Introduction
Photovoltaics (PVs) are undergoing rapid development driven by declining cost and increasing global demand for clean energy. To enable solar energy to serve as a sustainable power source, new PV materials with higher solar-to-electricity power conversion efficiency (PCE) and lower manufacturing costs are being pursued.1 Organometallic halide perovskites (OHPs) are a type of crystalline material with a structure of ABX3, where A is cesium (Cs), methylammonium (MA), or formamidinium (FA); B is lead (Pb) or tin (Sn); and X is chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), or iodine (I).2 OHPs have emerged as an excellent class of semiconducting materials suitable for use in a wide variety of optoelectronic devices, including solar cells,3,4 light-emitting diodes,5,6 transistors,7 photodetectors,8 and X-ray images.9 Among those applications, OHP-based solar cells are the most widely investigated devices because of their potential for PV applications. The first demonstration of OHP solar cells was reported by Miyasaka in 2009, who showed a PCE of 3.9%.3 Owing to the intensive efforts from the global PV research community, the PCE of OHP solar cells has markedly increased to 24.2% in less than a decade.10 More importantly, the high absorption coefficient, negligible energy loss, high PCE, and solution processability render OHP PV technology a competitive candidate in the PV market.11–13
For manufacturing, a step-by-step manufacturing process flow diagram shown in Fig. 1 has been proposed.14 Here, it is assumed that large-area, low-temperature deposition technique for manufacturing OHP solar modules is processed in ambient air. However, all OHP solar cells with PCEs exceeding 20% are made in the laboratory conditions with a small area (<0.1 cm2) and fabricated in a well-controlled glovebox free from moisture and oxygen.15 Therefore, to commercialize the technology, fabrication of highly efficient OHP solar cells in ambient air conditions using a manufacturable technique is of paramount importance.

The first objective to achieve air-processed OHP solar cells is to control the growth of OHP films in ambient air because the crystallinity and surface morphology of the films are known to be sensitive to the ambient conditions.16 Furthermore, to produce OHP solar cells in high volume, a roll-to-roll (R2R) process combined with industry-compatible techniques should be developed in order to translate the lab-scale solution process to an industrial-scale manufacturing method. In this review article, we summarize the most recent development in air-processed OHP solar cells and lab-to-industry fabrication techniques for upscaling of perovskite PVs. This review is organized as follows: We will discuss (1) microscopic understanding of the impacts of the ambient environment on crystallization and morphology of various OHP films, (2) methods to control the crystallization and morphology of OHP films in ambient air, (3) device engineering for highly efficient air-processed OHP solar cells on a large scale, and (4) remaining challenges and pathways toward commercialization of air-processed OHP solar cells.
2. Impact of ambient environment
OHP crystalline materials are known to be extremely sensitive to the ambient environment, especially water and oxygen in ambient air.17–19 It was previously believed that high-quality perovskite films and high device efficiency could only be obtained inside an inert glovebox environment. Moreover, water and oxygen are considered to exert detrimental effects on device performance and stability.20 However, Zhou et al. found that annealing a MAPbI3−xClx perovskite film in a damp environment with 30% RH could facilitate the growth of the larger crystal, resulting in an OHP solar cells with a record PCE of 19.3%.21 However, the underlying mechanism of how the environment would affect the quality of the perovskite film and the device performance was still controversy. To develop a fully air-processed technique for OHP solar cells, the role of the ambient environment throughout the process from the precursor solution preparation to the perovskite film crystallization and grain growth should be investigated in detail. Therefore, in this section, we summarize the impact of environmental factors (particularly water and oxygen) on the OHP solar cells.
2.1. Impact of water
The impact of water on the performance of OHP solar cells is a hot debating topic. Water is widely recognized as the main culprit of degradation in OHP compounds.22 Therefore, the precursor materials need to be anhydrous and the preparation process should be conducted in a well-controlled glovebox. Furthermore, an additional N2-protected dehydration process is required to eliminate water when precursor materials such as lead acetate trihydrate (Pb(Ac)2·3H2O) are hydrated,23 thus increasing the manufacturing complexity. However, a number of recent reports have shown both positive and negative effects of water on perovskite film formation and hence the device performance.24,25

2.1.1. Impact of water in a precursor solution. 
In several studies, water has been intentionally added to the OHP precursor solution both in one-step and two-step solution process. As shown in Fig. 2(a), Wu et al. added a small amount of water to a PbI2/dimethylformamide (DMF) solution in a two-step spin-coating process.24 PbI2 was found to be totally soluble in the mixed solvent when the volume ratio of water in DMF was as low as 0.5–3%. Scanning electron microscopy images suggest that smooth and compact PbI2 films can be obtained when the precursor solution contains 2–3 wt% water (Fig. 2(b)), leading to the formation of a densely packed perovskite film and a solar cell with a maximum PCE of 18% with a remarkably high fill factor of 85%. It was proposed that compared with DMF, water molecules can be dispersed more evenly on the hydrophilic surface of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hole transporting layer of the solar cell, thereby facilitating a homogeneous nucleation and growth of PbI2. Similar results were observed in a one-step spin-coating process where an addition of 2% water to a perovskite precursor solution enhanced the crystallization of perovskite and increased the film surface coverage on the substrate.26 Most recently, Liu et al. increased the water weight ratio to over 20% in a CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite precursor, as shown in Fig. 2(c). The additional water in the precursor solution slowed down the film drying rate compared with the dehydrated DMF solution, thereby reducing the nucleation rate of perovskite grains and resulting in a larger grain size in the perovskite film, as shown in Fig. 2(d and e).27 That study realized efficient OHP solar cells (PCE over 18%) with solvents containing large proportions of water (over 20%), easing the existing restrictions on air-free fabrication requirements and demonstrating the potential for air-processed OHP solar cells.

In addition to the positive effect of water in the precursor materials recently reported, perovskite precursor materials (alkylammonium salts and lead salts) can be hydrated when exposed to the ambient atmosphere and this was first observed in the strong hydroscopic methylammonium iodide (MAI). As shown in Fig. 3(a and b), Eperon et al. found that a hydrated MAI precursor did not affect the morphology and surface coverage of the resulting perovskite films. Furthermore, the perovskite film fabricated with hydrated MAI has a higher photoluminescence quantum efficiency and a longer exciton/carrier lifetime.28 A similarly enhanced radiative recombination was observed in a MAPbI3 film using hydrated Pb(Ac)2. Wang et al. found that hydration plays a key role in determining the roughness and porosity of perovskite films, as shown in Fig. 3(c);29 this is consistent with other recent reports.30 As shown in Fig. 3(d), the photoluminescence intensity was greatly enhanced in the samples prepared with hydrated Pb(Ac)2.29 These studies have shown water does result in suppression of the formation of nonradiative pathways in perovskite films, which in turn enhances PV device performance.

2.1.2. Impact of water during spin-coating and thermal annealing. 

Fig. 4(a) depicts a recent study by Li et al. where the authors demonstrated that humidity largely affects perovskite morphology and its surface coverage in a one-step spin-coating process.31 An anhydrous environment leads to the supersaturation of the perovskite precursor solution, which in turn leads to a higher nucleation density, resulting in better coverage of the perovskite film. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 4(b), lower humidity is preferred in a one-step spin-coating method to obtain fast and high-density nucleation for better perovskite crystallization and surface coverage.32

Reproduced from ref. 35 with permission from The Royal Society of Chemistry. 
In a two-step spin-coating process, MAI solution is deposited on the top of a PbI2 layer to complete the ionic reaction and form perovskite. Therefore, the impact of water on perovskite crystallization and growth in this process is different from that in a one-step process. In particular, the morphology of the underlying PbI2 film determines the quality of the resulting perovskite film. As shown in Fig. 4(c), Cheng et al. demonstrated that a PbI2 film with an isolated branching structure is formed when it is prepared in an environment with RH of 20% or higher. This is because of the fast nucleation of PbI2 induced by the adsorption of water during the spin-coating process. Consequently, the morphology of the corresponding perovskite films follows the underlying PbI2 film with low surface coverage.33 In addition to the morphology impact, using the first-principle calculation, water was found to incorporate into the CH3NH3PbI3 crystallites and form perovskite intermediate hydrates (CH3NH3PbI3·xH2O) during film growth; these hydrates trigger the degradation of perovskite to PbI2.34
In contrast to the detrimental effect of water in the spin-coating process, water exerts some positive effects on perovskite films during the thermal annealing process. Zhou et al. annealed a perovskite film under an RH of 30% ± 5%, where the presence of moisture enhanced the reconstruction of the perovskite film through the partial dissolution of CH3NH3I and CH3NH3Cl organic species and acceleration of mass transport within the film, resulting in a fully covered perovskite film with large grains.21 Subsequently, a similar dissolution–recrystallization mechanism induced by water during thermal annealing was proposed.35 As shown in Fig. 4(d), H2O molecules first penetrated into the perovskite structure and destroyed the bonding between MA+ and the Pb–I cage. After the evaporation of the H2O molecules, the released free MA+ reacted with the Pb–I cage again. This recrystallization process resulted in the observed larger perovskite grains with thermal annealing at a high RH.35

2.2. Impact of oxygen
In contrast to the impact of water on perovskite crystallization and surface morphology, oxygen strongly influences the crystal quality and stability of perovskite films. You et al. demonstrated that oxygen did not affect the surface morphology of a CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite film prepared using a one-step spin-coating method.36 Similarly, in a two-step spin-coating method, oxygen had negligible effects on the morphology of PbI2 films.37 On the other hand, Cheng et al. found that oxygen led to severe dewetting when the PbI2 precursor solution was deposited on various substrates during a two-step spin-coating process.33 They measured the contact angles on various substrates, from hydrophilic PEDOT:PSS to hydrophobic N2200 surfaces, in the presence and absence of oxygen, and found that the contact angles on all substrates increased in the presence of oxygen as shown in Fig. 5(a). Furthermore, a critical contact angle of approximately 30° was identified for depositing the PbI2 layer in air to achieve compact and uniform coverage. Oxygen has been demonstrated to alter the wetting property of PbI2 solution on various charge carrier transporting interlayers, thereby affecting film formation and resulting perovskite layers.

Oxygen can improve the quality and stability of perovskite crystals during thermal annealing. Ren et al. demonstrated that thermal annealing treatment under oxygen efficiently improved perovskite crystal quality by reducing defects.38 These results were further confirmed by the recent report on the healing effects of light and oxygen in CH3NH3PbI3 films, as shown in Fig. 5(b). Brenes et al. found that photogenerated electrons in a device can reduce oxygen and form superoxide O2−, which can effectively bind to electron traps and reduce the recombination.39
Superoxide O2− species are not always advantageous to perovskites; they have been shown to be the origin of degradation of perovskite films when said films are exposed to light and oxygen.40–42 By monitoring the compositional change in an aged film (Fig. 5(c)), Aristidou et al. proposed the following perovskite degradation mechanism:40      The authors further applied an ab initio calculation based on density functional theory techniques to reveal that under light, the vacant iodine site has the lowest formation energy for the reduction of O2− species in the perovskite crystal, as shown in Fig. 5(d).41 Ma et al. also demonstrated that the oxygen molecule has a negative effect on OHP solar cells based on the first-principles calculation. They found that the oxygen can be adsorbed on the (100) surface of MAPbI3 perovskite by van der Waals force. Under illumination, the adsorbed oxygen molecules can be reduced to O2− species by photogenerated electrons, inducing defects at the surface of perovskite film.43
In summary, water and oxygen have both positive and negative effects on the formation and stability of perovskite films. They play different roles in different processing steps from the preparation of a precursor solution to thermal annealing of films. Specifically, to obtain smooth perovskite films with a high surface coverage, moisture and oxygen should be eliminated during the spin-coating process. On the hand, during the thermal annealing process, the presence of water and oxygen can be utilized to facilitate the growth of perovskite films. Nevertheless, exposure of perovskite films to air under light induces severe degradation. Besides the environmental factors, we believe that the use of ion mixtures (with Rb, Cs, MA, FA; and Cl, Br, I) might also affect the crystallization of air-processed OHP since the composition of OHP is very sensitive to the ambient air. Most recently, Trilok et al. have demonstrated that Cs incorporation in (FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3)x can improve the PCE of air-processed OHP solar cells to 20.8%, but the underlying mechanism is still unclear.44 Therefore, this topic should be further studied to stimulate the development of highly efficient air-processed OHP solar cells.
3. Development of air-processed OHP solar cells
In this section, we discuss several recent advances in the development of air-processed OHP solar cells from lab-scale to industry-compatible technologies. For lab-scale devices (<1 cm2), the most widely used fabrication method is spin-coating. For industry-scale perovskite modules, a large area of up to hundreds of square centimeters can be realized by spray coating, inkjet printing, and slot-die to integrate with a high-throughput R2R process.45
3.1. Lab-scale development of air-processed OHP solar cells
Both one-step and two-step solution deposition methods are most commonly used to fabricate OHP solar cells for fundamental studies in research laboratories. Typically, in a one-step process, perovskite precursor inks with different formulas are drop-casted onto substrates and thermally annealed to form a perovskite layer. In a two-step process, a metal halide layer (e.g., PbI2) is first deposited onto the substrate. Subsequently, an MAI layer is deposited on top to react with the underlying metal halide film and form a perovskite layer. As discussed, the ambient environment affects both the perovskite conversion reaction and crystallization. Various approaches have been employed to develop air-processed OHP solar cells for one- or two-step processing.

3.1.1. One-step process for air-processed OHP solar cells. 
In one-step processing, the crystallization of perovskite in ambient air is rapid and uncontrollable under high humidity. To reduce the detrimental effect of moisture on perovskite formation, an additive engineering technique with NH4Cl was applied by Rong et al. to slow down the crystallization rate of perovskite.46 As shown in Fig. 6(a), after film deposition, crystallization of CH3NH3PbI3 is inhibited by forming an intermediate of CH3NH3X·NH4PbX3(H2O)2 (X = I or Cl). Upon thermal annealing, moisture in ambient air accelerates the removal of NH4+ and induces transition of the intermediate to the perovskite phase. Finally, the device based on CH3NH3PbI3 fabricated in ambient air with an RH of 35% achieves a maximum efficiency of 15.6%.46

(c) The crystallization and growth of air-processed perovskite films with different annealing processes. Reproduced from ref. 48 with permission from The Royal Society of Chemistry. 
Addition of antisolvents during the one-step deposition process is another key factor controlling the morphological and electronic properties of perovskite films. Troughton et al. compared perovskite films fabricated with several commonly used antisolvents (i.e., ethyl acetate, diethyl ether, toluene, and chlorobenzene) in ambient air. Fig. 6(b) shows photographs of the corresponding perovskite films, where the film processed with ethyl acetate was highly reflective, indicating a smooth surface.47 Compared with the other antisolvents, ethyl acetate had the highest ability to dissolve water (3.3 vol%). During perovskite film deposition, ethyl acetate serves as a moisture absorber and prevents the ingress of water from being involved in the crystallization process.
In addition to selecting the most appropriate film deposition process, controlling the thermal annealing condition is another effective approach to improve perovskite film quality. Wang et al. found that perovskite films fabricated in ambient air possess larger grain size but have considerable gaps between grain boundaries. This is mainly because the moisture in the air reduces the nucleation density and the large nucleus radius results in island growth of the perovskite during thermal annealing.48 Therefore, the authors employed a vacuum annealing process to accelerate solvent evaporation and increase supersaturation of the residual precursor solution on the substrate. Through this approach, the nucleation density is increased, thereby bridging the physical contacts between grains after film deposition, as illustrated in Fig. 6(c). Another approach, namely interface engineering, was demonstrated to control the nucleation of perovskite films in ambient air.49


3.1.2. Two-step process for air-processed OHP solar cells. 
For two-step deposition, a PbI2 layer is first coated on the substrate; the morphology of PbI2 directly determines the morphology of the final perovskite films. Both water and oxygen in ambient air exert detrimental effects on the formation of perovskite films. To eliminate or reduce the impact of ambient air during perovskite film deposition, Cheng et al. proposed a preheating method to obtain a smooth PbI2 layer with a high surface coverage in ambient air. The formation of a preheating-assistant vapor shield during PbI2 layer deposition is illustrated in Fig. 7(a).33 Through preheating, the evaporation rate of DMF increased and the solvent vapor effectively prevented the ingress of water and oxygen into the perovskite layer. They achieved a record PCE of 18% for the air-processed OHP solar cells under 70% RH. Subsequently, Xu et al. from the same research group further modified the preheating method by incorporating CsI into the PbI2 layer to develop an air-processed OHP solar cell with superior stability.50 Another study demonstrated a similar idea, namely using an organic solvent vapor to protect perovskite films in ambient air, to fabricate air-processed OHP solar cells, as shown in Fig. 7(b).51 Because moisture in air can induce rapid crystallization of PbI2 and form large PbI2 domains with a number of pinholes, Wang et al. introduced ZnO nanoparticles into a PbI2 precursor solution as nucleation sites to control the crystallization process of the PbI2 layer; this resulted in an air-processed OHP solar cell with a maximum PCE of 18%.52

To improve the water tolerance of perovskite films in ambient air, Liu et al. induced surface ligands to modify the PbI2 layer with hydrophobic functional groups.53 As shown in Fig. 7(c), the researchers employed hydrophobic 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) as a surface-modification agent to augment the hydrophobicity of the PbI2 layer in the first-step deposition, thereby preventing the ingress of water. In the second-step deposition, after the PbI2 reacted with MAI, the corresponding CH3NH3PbI3 crystallites were still surrounded by residual hydrophobic tBP molecules. This provides a new strategy to eliminate the moisture effect and fabricate perovskite films in ambient air. However, the quantity of tBP should be accurately controlled to ensure maximum device efficiency and reproducibility. Tai et al. successfully demonstrated an air-processed OHP solar cell with over 15% efficiency using a similar idea. Instead of using hydrophobic additives, the researchers chose lead thiocyanate (Pb(SCN)2) with a higher moisture resistance than PbI2 as a precursor material during the first-step deposition. A high-quality CH3NH3PbI3−x(SCN)x perovskite film was formed by the reaction between Pb(SCN)2 and MAI in the air even with RH over 70%. As shown in Fig. 7(d), strong ionic interactions were observed between SCN− and Pb atoms, as well as hydrogen bonds formed between SCN− and CH3NH3+, leading to the improved chemical stability of CH3NH3PbI3−x(SCN)x perovskites in the air.54 Through this approach, the intrinsic water tolerance of perovskite films was considerably improved, and the OHP solar cells fabricated using this method reached a high PCE of up to 15% in the air with RH of 70%.

3.2. Industry-scale development of air-processed OHP solar cells
To realize the commercialization of OHP solar cells, a high-throughput fabrication process for depositing high-quality perovskite layers is necessary to complete the transition from laboratory to industrial scale. In this section we summarize the progress of air-processed OHP solar cells fabricated by the most commonly used high-throughput processes with industry-compatible deposition methods scalable to the R2R process.55–59 Use of doctor blading instead of spin-coating is expected to be an intermediate step for upscaling the deposition of perovskite layers in a large area. Yang et al. first studied the impact of humidity in ambient air on perovskite film formation by using the doctor blading technique. As shown in Fig. 8(a), the color of perovskite films is strongly affected by the humidity level in ambient air. The perovskite films were grey, black, and dark brown for humidity values of 60–70%, 40–50%, and 15–25%, respectively.60 This phenomenon agreed well with a previous study that used the spin-coating method; this verifies that a higher humidity level can induce fast crystallization of perovskites having a low nucleation density, resulting in a poor surface coverage.33,61 By controlling the RH value to between 15% and 25%, the researchers successfully fabricated an OHP solar cell with a maximum PCE of 10.44% in ambient air.60

In addition to humidity, the substrate temperature has been found as another key factor that influences perovskite film growth during the doctor blading process in ambient air. Mallajosyula et al. demonstrated that a substrate temperature of 120 °C is the threshold for perovskite crystal formation by doctor blading in air.62 Below this temperature, the phase conversion to perovskite is limited by the low activation energy. As shown in Fig. 8(b), the grain size of perovskite can reach hundreds of micrometers when the temperature of the substrate increases to 165 °C. The authors found that the precursor solution volume and blading speed affect perovskite layer formation and the corresponding device performance. After optimization, they obtained an OHP solar cell with a PCE of 7.32% by blading the hot perovskite precursor solution in ambient air. Most recently, Deng et al. demonstrated that adding a small amount (∼20 ppm) of surfactant additives (L-α-phosphatidylcholine) to perovskite ink can significantly improve the quality of perovskite films coated by doctor blading in ambient air, even at a high coating speed of 180 m h−1.55 The researchers proposed that the surfactant molecules can self-assemble on the surface of the deposited perovskite ink and reduce the surface tension of the solution. Therefore, the perovskite ink flow dynamics could be effectively suppressed during the drying process and a high-quality perovskite layer with full coverage could be formed. As shown in Fig. 8(c), the researchers successfully fabricated 57.2 cm2 perovskite modules with a high PCE of 14.6% through the fast blading technique in ambient air. It is believed that this solvent engineering on perovskite inks could serve as a general approach to fabricating high-quality perovskite layers through other scalable deposition methods in ambient air.
The first air-processed OHP solar cell obtained through ultrasonic spray deposition was reported by Barrows and colleagues.63 Although the surface coverage of the perovskite film on the substrate was only approximately 85%, the researchers achieved a PCE as high as 11% by optimizing processing parameters such as the substrate temperature and annealing treatment. At that time, the efficiency of the OHP solar cells fabricated through spray coating was comparable to the efficiency of that fabricated through spin coating, making spray coating an attractive technique for large-area devices. However, spray coating with one-step deposition suffers from poor surface coverage with pin holes.13,64,65 The two-step ultrasonic spray method was developed to solve the problem of pin holes with uniform CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films and provide a full surface coverage in ambient air.66–68 With improved film quality, the OHP solar cells achieved a high PCE of 16%. Notably, the processing window of the one-step deposition process is narrower than that of the two-step process. Further development on one-step deposition such as solvent engineering or interface engineering is necessary to obtain pin-hole free perovskite films with high efficiency. Furthermore, spray coating is a powerful approach to deposit charge carrier transporting layers for OHP solar cells. More research on perovskite solar modules or panels should be conducted to demonstrate their potential for upscaling the OHP PV technology.
R2R process has been used to fabricate large-area organic solar cells,69,70 and translated to fabricate OHP solar cells. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) in Australia focuses on the development of large-area air-processed OHP solar cells and has achieved several notable milestones. Most recently, Zuo et al., from the CSIRO, found that the morphology and crystallinity of air-processed CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films can be improved by an NH4Cl additive in the precursor solution. The researchers employed a nitrogen blowing-assisted drop-casting method instead of using spin coating to deposit the perovskite layer in air, and achieved a record PCE of 19.48% for air-processed OHP solar cell with a 0.1 cm2 active area on a glass substrate. Furthermore, they transferred this method to R2R on a flexible substrate, resulting in a PCE of 11.16% with negligible hysteresis.59 The improvement in PCE is due to the high crystallinity and large crystallite size of the perovskite induced by the NH4Cl additive in ambient air. Further material optimization and R2R processing improvements are expected to deliver efficiencies of more than 15% for perovskite solar modules. The next target for perovskite technology is believed to be the fabrication of the back electrode (metal or carbon) through the R2R process. Although this topic has been reported, the device performance achieved thus far is low, and thus further development is required to optimize the process and improve the device performance with a complete R2R printing technique.
4. Summary and outlook
In recent years, the PCE of OHP solar cells has undergone a rapid increase to a maximum of 24.2%. However, such OHP solar cells face issues when translating them from lab-scale fabrication to industrial-scale manufacturing. In this review, we provided an overview of the recent development of air-processed OHP solar cells to realize high-efficiency devices in ambient air and manufacturing methods for upscaling. First, we presented a comprehensive understanding of the impact of the ambient environment on the crystallization and growth of perovskite films. Second, we discussed a diverse range of approaches that have been developed to fabricate highly efficient air-processed OHP solar cells. As shown in Fig. 9(a), the efficiency gap between a device fabricated in an inert environment and one fabricated in the air has reduced considerably over the preceding 4 years. The PCE of lab-scale air-processed OHP solar cells has been greatly increased from 5% in 2014 to 20% in 2018, but remains slightly lower than that of OHP solar cells fabricated under a controlled environment (24.2%). Finally, we summarized several upscaling fabrication technologies for OHP solar cells in ambient air. Fig. 9(b) shows the record efficiency of OHP solar cells developed using industry-compatible methods including spray coating, printing, slot-die, doctor blading and R2R. It is difficult to evaluate which method is promising for future development of air-processed OHP solar cells, since all the processes are still under development and have a similar record efficiency around 15%. However, considering the compatibility to the cost-competitive R2R manufacturing process on flexible substrates for future low-cost mass production of large-area OHP solar cells, we believe that the relatively simple slot-die coating would have a larger potential among other large-scale methods. In particular, it has been demonstrated that using slot-die-coating method, one can achieve high-quality air-processed perovskite films on flexible substrates with the R2R process.57,71 However, some basic questions and practical issues remain to be solved before the perovskite PV technology is commercialized.

Because the module price for Si-based PVs has dropped since 2011 to 0.3–0.5 US$ per Watt-peak,72 it is challenging for perovskite PV to enter the solar energy market. However, the solution processability73 and tunable energy bandgap74 make perovskite a potential candidate for developing high-efficiency low-cost tandem structured devices. A theoretical efficiency of 46% can be achieved by two-junction tandem perovskite with a front absorber bandgap of 1.7–1.9 eV and back absorber bandgap of 0.9–1.2 eV.75,76 Recent development of perovskite materials through compositional engineering has demonstrated reasonable device performance in large and small bandgaps.77–81 With greater efficiency, the tandem PVs is an effective way to reduce the cost. However, in view of large-scale production, fabricating all-solution processed tandem devices is a challenge. In particular, a charge recombination layer (CRL) sandwiched between two perovskite layers often requires very fine engineering in terms of material solubility and electrical conductivity. In addition, the thickness of the CRL demonstrated on the laboratory scale is usually less than 50 nm.82 Therefore, it is both scientifically valuable and technologically crucial to develop a uniform CRL layer with large-area coating methods. Finally, the long-discussed issues of photo-stability,83,84 lifetime,85,86 and toxicity87–89 could also determine the viability of perovskite in PV applications.
