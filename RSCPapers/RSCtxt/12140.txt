    , Accepted 12th August 2021First published on 13th August 2021AbstractSuppressing the anionic mobility in solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) is crucial to mitigate the ionic conductivity and internal cell polarization, thus upgrading the stability and cycle life of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Now, a series of novel conducting solid polymer electrolytes (CSPEs) with a zwitterionic structure comprising TEOS which was grafted to nitrogen-centered cations connected to hydrophilic sulfonate and carboxylate groups were used as SPEs in LIBs. The quaternized 1,8-diaminonaphthalene polyvinylidene difluoride lithium-ion conducting electrolyte (DN-PF-LCP) as an SPE component in LIBs achieves outstanding ionic conductivity (8.69 × 10−4 S cm−1), a sufficient capacity of 136 mA h g−1 with a decent capacity retention of 96% at a current rate of 0.3C over 200 cycles at 25 °C, and superior thermo-stability (∼420 °C). The zwitterionic structure of the DN-PF-LCP CSPE provides strong molecular interactions and efficiently facilitates the disintegration of Li+ ions, thus stimulating the mobility of Li+ ions within the CSPE and enhancing the Li+ ion conduction properties. The hydrogen bonding and ion–dipole interactions in the DN-PF-LCP CSPE provide nanosized self-agglomeration of anions and provide interaction between anions and their structurally homologous matrix, thus impeding the mobility of anions and lithium dendritic growth. These outstanding characteristics of DN-PF-LCP make it promising as a CSPE for LIBs.
Introduction
Humans are facing serious threats caused by pollution, climatic variations, and unbalanced fossil fuel resources. To overcome the dependency on non-renewable energy sources, much more attention has been paid to renewable energy sources such as wind and solar energy.1 However, due to the erratic nature of these resources, more interest has been shown in energy storage and conversion systems to store the surplus energy and deliver it to the grid.2 Considering the recently available technologies, LIBs have been considered important candidates for energy storage and conversion due to their high energy density in power batteries and portable consumer electronics.3,4 The metallic lithium is considered as the ideal negative electrode due to its low standard electrode potential (−3.04 V) and greater theoretical gravimetric capacity (3860 mA h g−1).5 Nevertheless, it seems unsuited with liquid electrolytes due to its high reactivity. Particularly, the continuous growth of lithium dendrites resulting from the concentration gradient near the anode may cause an internal short-circuit. Moreover, the flammable and explosive organic nature of the liquid electrolyte, as well as its leakage problem, may cause risks of explosion hazards and serious safety issues during the battery operation.
Solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) have got much attention due to their wide electrochemical window, low flammability, solidity, non-volatility, excellent safety, and promising thermostability during cycling.6,7 Generally, SSEs have been classified as inorganic solid electrolytes (ISEs) and solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs). The former class consists of inorganic glasses and ceramics. Though the conductivity of ISEs is comparable to that of conventional liquid electrolytes, it is hard for them to come into close contact with adjacent electrodes due to their hard attributes and intrinsically brittle nature.8 On the other hand, SPEs have gained more research attention due to their good flexibility, facile processability, and stable contact with solid electrodes.9 Thus, SPEs are more appropriate to be applied for large-scale processing in solid-state LIBs due to their better interfacial compatibility. However, the major problems associated with SPEs are their relatively low ionic conductivity and low lithium-ion transference number (LTN) at room temperature that may cause small capacity utilization and fast performance deterioration.10 Hence, achieving high ionic conductivity, stable cycle stability, and fast ionic transport in SPEs still remains challenging.
Among various polymeric matrixes, including polyethylene oxide (PEO), tri(propylene glycol) diacrylate (TPGDA), poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC), and polyacrylonitrile (PAN),11–14 PEO has been extensively used due to its extraordinary compatibility with different lithium salts and low cost. Unfortunately, the low ionic conductivity at room temperature (∼10−6 S cm−1), narrow electrochemical window (under 3.8 V vs. Li/Li+), and poor mechanical stability limit its further application due to the high crystallinity of PEO. There is a trade-off between mechanical stability and ionic conductivity, but high strength and greater ionic conductivity in one polymer electrolyte are very hard to achieve simultaneously.15 Inert fillers (i.e. SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2) have been introduced into the PEO matrix to improve the conductivity of PEO-based composite SPEs.16 Moreover, the Mg2B2O5 nanowire was fabricated to provide poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-based solid-state electrolytes with enhanced ionic conductivity and a large electrochemical window.17 Furthermore, the Li2S additive was introduced to modify the Li/electrode interface for obtaining stable lithium metal batteries. Li2S stimulates the formation of abundant LiF nanocrystals in the Li/PEO interface to prevent the continuous interface reaction between PEO and Li.18 Active fillers with extraordinary ionic conductivity including garnet-type or perovskite-type were also used to enhance the ionic movement in PEO-based CSPEs.19,20 Nevertheless, PEO-based SPEs with superior thermal stability, high room-temperature conductivity, and greater mechanical stability are hardly achieved using the mentioned approaches due to their higher crystallinities.
Polysiloxanes possess low glass transition temperature, high free volume, and high thermal stability which show the excluded volume of a polymeric system.21 Hence, polysiloxanes have attracted much attention due to their flexible polymeric backbone. Karatas22 and Liu23et al. studied oligo (ethylene glycol) substituted polysiloxanes as ion conducting polymers, but their narrow electrochemical window and general ionic conductivity cannot fulfill the requirement of LIBs. In contrast, tetrahedral coordination of silicon with oxygen in tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) increases the crosslinking and strengthens the mechanical properties of a polymeric film due to Si–O–Si and Si–O–C bond formation.24 Moreover, TEOS provides hydrogen bonding for ionic transportation,25,26 and enhances thermal stability by controlling the swelling of the polymeric film due to its crosslinking nature.27 PEO has low ionic conductivity due to its crystallinity, however, the impregnation of zwitterions enhances the flexibility of EO segments and suppresses the PEO crystallinity, thus considerably stimulating the mobility of Li+ ions. Thus, it is significant to synthesize zwitterionic structured SPEs for promoting the electrochemical performance of SPEs. Furthermore, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) deserves special attention because of its high ionic conductivity and relatively low crystallinity at ambient temperature. The anionic charge density of SPEs has a remarkable impact on the dissociation of Li+ ions, while the greater negative charge density impedes the dissociation of Li+ ions.28 Therefore, to upgrade the battery performance, it is a demanding job to synthesize novel SPEs providing high ionic conductivity and reducing the anionic mobility along with reasonable thermo-mechanical stability.
Herein, we have designed and synthesized a series of novel CSPEs with a zwitterionic structure composed of TEOS which was grafted to nitrogen-centered cations connected to hydrophilic sulfonate and carboxylate groups to balance the Li+ ion flux, enhance the ionic conductivity and impede the anionic mobility to upgrade their performances. TEOS acts as a crosslinker by imparting hydrogen bonding to improve the Li+ ion diffusivity and thermo-mechanical stability of the fabricated CSPEs, while the zwitterionic structure of CSPEs contributes to the ionic conductivity, improves the coulombic efficiency, and promotes a stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) due to the remarkable ion–dipole interactions and Li+ dissociation. The electrochemical and physicochemical characterization reveals that the synthesized materials (i.e. quaternized 1,8-diaminonaphthalene (Q-DAN), quaternized 4,4′-diamino-3,3′-dimethyl diphenylmethane (Q-DMP), and quaternized 1,8-diaminooctane (Q-DAO)) with aromatic rings tether anions to promote negative charge dispersion and provide favorable interactions with TEOS, sulfosuccinic acid (SSA), and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) to enhance the Li+ disintegration and dissociation. Moreover, the effect of polymeric backbones (i.e. PVDF and PEO) on the LIB performance was explored individually and jointly during the impregnation of the synthesized functional materials and inorganic precursor. Combined with these synergistic advantages, comparatively greater ionic conductivities, high thermo-mechanical properties, and suitable electrochemical stability are obtained for the synthesized CSPEs that may provide a good LIB performance. LiFePO4 coin cells with synthesized CSPEs demonstrate decent electrochemical performance, exhibiting good practicability, environmental adaptability, and great potential for use in LIBs.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and structural evaluation of CSPEs

Fig. 1 illustrates our strategy for preparing CSPEs that involves the synthesis of novel functional materials (Q-DAN, Q-DMP, and Q-DAO), representing the optimum structures of CSPEs, and a subsequent chemical reaction followed by crosslinking and thermal heat treatment. The obtained CSPEs were comparable to the conventional SPE in hindering the concentration polarization and preventing the growth of lithium dendrites.

The proton NMR spectra of glycidyltrimethylammonium chloride (GTAC), 1,8-diaminonaphthalene (DAN), 4,4′-diamino-3,3′-dimethyl diphenylmethane (DMP), 1,8-diaminooctane (DAO), Q-DAN, Q-DMP, and Q-DAO are shown in Fig. S3.† The chemical shift from 6.4–7.3 ppm represents the availability of aromatic protons for DAN, DMP, Q-DAN, and Q-DMP (Fig. S3b–e,† respectively).29 The protons of the alkyl chains are shifted from 1.15–1.25 ppm to 4.0–4.25 ppm during the synthesis of Q-DAO (Fig. S3f and g†).30 The CSPEs were prepared via a sol–gel reaction with Q-DAN, Q-DMP, and Q-DAO. The DMP-PF-LCP, DAO-PF-LCP, DN-PFPO-LCP CSPEs, and PFPO were analyzed via XPS analysis (Fig. 2b, c and S4a, b†). The high-resolution XPS survey demonstrated the occurrence of the predictable elements F 1s, O 1s, N 1s, C 1s, S 2s, Si 2s, Si 2p, and Li 1s (Fig. 2a). The peaks at 400.5 eV, 235 eV, 165 eV, 103 eV, and 33.85 eV in the fabricated CSPEs are assigned to N 1s, S 2s, Si 2s, Si 2p, and Li 1s respectively.31 These peaks were absent in the polymeric matrix (PFPO) and confirmed the existence of Q-DMP, Q-DAO, Q-DAN, SSA, and TEOS moieties inside the synthesized CSPEs.32 The high resolution of XPS spectra was deconvoluted for the elemental confirmation (Fig. 2b, c and S4a, b†). The deconvolutions of C 1s for DMP-PF-LCP, PFPO, DAO-PF-LCP, and DN-PFPO-LCP are provided (Fig. 2b, c and S4a, b†). For these CSPEs and PFPO, C 1s scans in Fig. 2b, c and S4a, b,† rather than C–C/C–H (284.5 eV), C–N (285.2 eV), C–O (286.2 eV), CO (288.2 eV),33 C–S (284.9 eV), C–OH (285.8 eV),34 C–F2 (290.5 eV), and C–F3 (293.5 eV) peaks,35 while some peaks such as C–N, CO, C–F3, and C–S were absent in the PFPO (Fig. 2b) that demonstrates the successful incorporation and crosslinking of Q-DAN, Q-DMP, Q-DAO, SSA and TEOS into the PFPO polymer matrix.

Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was used to perform the compositional analysis of DN-PF-LCP (C, N, S, F, O, Si), PFPO (C, F, O) (Fig. 2d–n), DMP-PF-LCP, and DAO-PF-LCP (C, N, S, F, O, Si) (Fig. S4c–p†). The peaks for sulfur and silica elements were observed at 2 keV binding energy, while the peak for the nitrogen was detected at 0.5 keV binding energy for DN-PF-LCP, DMP-PF-LCP, and DAO-PF-LCP (Fig. 2d and S4c, j†) because of sulfonate and carboxylate anions, TEOS and quaternized amine groups (i.e. Q-DAN, Q-DMP, and Q-DAO). The elemental mapping showed the absence of S, N, and Si in PFPO, while these elements were present in DN-PF-LCP, DMP-PF-LCP, and DAO-PF-LCP, and their uniform distribution (Fig. 2h–j, S4g–i, and S4n–p†) validates that Q-DAN, Q-DMP, Q-DAO, SSA, and TEOS were successfully incorporated into the synthesized CSPEs as well as verifying the incorporation of Q-DAN, Q-DMP, Q-DAO, SSA, and TEOS into PFPO.
The chemical and structural characterization of PFPO, PVDF, CSPEs, and synthesized materials is carried out by IR measurements (Fig. 2o). The absorption bands at 790 cm−1 confirm the quaternary nitrogen, while the peaks at 954 cm−1 can be attributed to Si–O–Si and Si–O–C networks which verify the successful incorporation of TEOS in CSPEs.27 Similarly, the absorption bands at 1250 cm−1 and 705 cm−1 are assigned to the OSO and S–O respectively for synthesized CSPEs, which successfully confirm the introduction of SSA into the fabricated CSPEs.36 The spectrum at 1130 cm−1 represents the C–O bond, and the absorption band at 1350 cm−1 illustrates the –C–N stretching in Q-DAN, Q-DMP, and Q-DAO.37 The absorption bands located at 1095 cm−1 and 760 cm−1 are attributed to the C–O of a secondary alcohol and C–C of electrophilic aromatic substitution for the synthesized Q-DAN and Q-DMP, respectively, while the peak at 1715 cm−1 can be assigned to the carbonyl stretching (CO) and C(O)O asymmetric structure of carboxylic acid for the synthesized CSPEs, which confirm the limited participation of the carbonyl of SSA in the reaction.31,38,39 The skeleton vibrations located at 1505 cm−1 and 1410 cm−1 are attributed to the CC stretching in the aromatic rings of Q-DAN and Q-DMP.40 The absorption peak at 3476 cm−1 demonstrates the –O–H stretching vibration of the hydroxyl groups of synthesized Q-DAN, and Q-DMP, while the broad absorption bands located at 3420 cm−1 correspond to the hydroxyl group in the as-prepared CSPEs. There is a decrease in the stretching vibration of –O–H for synthesized SPEs, which is a basic IR characteristic for hydrogen bond formation apart from the frequency shift of the corresponding Lewis base.26,41 Thus, this observation showed the successful formation of intermolecular H-bonding in the CSPEs due to the pendant –O–H group in the polymer matrix of as-prepared CSPEs. These absorption bands validate the polycondensation reaction among Q-DAN, Q-DMP, Q-DAO, SSA, TEOS, PVDF and PEO, and hence successfully confirm the introduction of Q-DAN, Q-DMP, and Q-DAO into the polymeric matrix.
Morphological studies of the CSPEs
The color of the CSPEs was gradually lightened with the addition of Q-DAN, Q-DMP and Q-DAO, turning from black to light yellow in the optical images (Fig. 3a). Representative CSPEs including DN-PF-LCP, DMP-PF-LCP and DAO-PF-LCP before cycling (Fig. 3b–g) and after cycling (Fig. 3h–m) were chosen for the SEM morphological studies. The surface morphology of the CSPEs leads to a smaller extent of phase separation (Fig. 3b–d) while no micropores were observed in the cross-section (Fig. 3e–g). The diverse morphologies were due to the phase separation between the polymeric backbone and hydrophilic functionalities.

The polymeric backbone (PVDF) is hydrophobic while the synthesized functionalities (Q-DAN, Q-DMP, and Q-DAO) are strongly hydrophilic and provide a slightly interconnected microporous structure during the evaporation of DMF. The interconnected microporous morphologies enhance the ionic conduction inside the polymeric matrix of CSPEs.42 However, by analyzing the surface and cross-sectional morphologies more deeply, no visible pores and cracks were observed and illustrate a homogeneous and dense structure. After 500 cycles of operation, the DN-PF-LCP and the DMP-PF-LCP and DAO-PF-LCP CSPEs after 200 cycles were carefully taken out from the battery and analyzed by SEM (Fig. 3h–m). The surface and cross-section of the representative CSPEs were dense and homogeneous without obvious dendrite formation,43 which demonstrates that the synthesized CSPE is not only efficient in reducing the interfacial impedance but also effectively curbs the dendrite formation and promotes a uniform interface as well as constant Li+ flux across the interface.
The morphological analysis of the representative CSPEs (i.e. DN-PF-LCP, DMP-PF-LCP, and DAO-PF-LCP) was also carried out via AFM analysis. The insertion of Q-DAN, Q-DMP, and Q-DAO into the polymeric matrix provides a uniform and smooth surface morphology (Fig. 3n–p). The brighter and darker domains illustrate the hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions respectively for these CSPEs.29 Upgrading the immiscibility and hydrophilic–hydrophobic domains provides the building of continuous hydrophilic ionic conducting channels because the ionic cluster became more interconnected with smaller dimensions due to the introduction of Q-DAN, Q-DMP, and Q-DAO inside the polymeric matrix.
These continuous ionic conducting channels facilitate fast movement of Li+ ions inside the dense polymeric structure of CSPEs and enhance the interfacial contact of the electrodes and electrolytes to improve their performance. DN-PF-LCP was also examined by AFM after 500 cycles (Fig. 3q), while the DAM-PF-LCP and DAO-PF-LCP were examined after 200 cycles (Fig. 3r and s) and were found to be in a dense and homogeneous form without obvious dendrite formation,44 which demonstrates that the fabricated CSPEs efficiently reduce the dendrite formation and can be potentially used for long term operation in LIBs.
Thermomechanical stability of the fabricated CSPEs
The DN-PF-LCP, DMP-PF-LCP, and DAO-PF-LCP CSPEs were selected as representatives for investigating the thermal stability (Fig. 4a and b). No major weight loss was detected until 385 °C due to the incorporation of Q-DAN, Q-DMP, and Q-DAO (Fig. 4a). Moreover, no weight loss before 100 °C verified the complete dryness of the CSPEs (Fig. 4a), while the minor weight loss before 385 °C can be attributed to the condensation of unreacted hydroxyl (–OH) groups. The thermal degradation temperature (Td) and initial decomposition temperature (IDT) were enhanced with the incorporation of Q-DAN, Q-DMP, and Q-DAO contents (Fig. 4b), while Td temperatures were shifted to 420 °C, 428 °C, and 435 °C for DN-PF-LCP, DMP-PF-LCP, and DAO-PF-LCP respectively which provided excellent thermal stability for the battery safety. The higher Td of DAO-PF-LCP is attributed to the introduction of aliphatic amines into the polymeric matrix compared to the aromatic amines as observed in previously reported studies.45,46 Overall, synthesized CSPEs exhibit outstanding thermo-stability with higher thermal decomposition temperatures of more than 420 °C. This thermal stability was more than the previously reported SPEs,47–52 and found to be satisfactory to be potentially used in LIBs without short-circuit at elevated temperature.

The stress and strain are the important parameters to examine the mechanical stability of the synthesized CSPEs (Fig. 4c) and to prevent the short-circuit that may occur from the anode and cathode during application in LIBs. The stress shows the resistance of CSPEs against mechanical force while the strain represents their flexibility. The stress and strain values for the CSPEs are in the range of 0.2237–1.08 MPa and 10.012–40.55%, respectively. DN-PF-LCP demonstrates greater mechanical stability due to the rigid structure of the two adjacent aromatic rings, as well as miscibility and crosslinking nature of organic and inorganic moiety in the CSPE matrix,27 while the mechanical stability of the DN-PFPO-LCP decreased because of the incorporation of the PEO that enhanced the crystallinity and reduced its flexibility.47–50 The alkyl spacer adjacent to the PEO chain made the CSPEs denser, less stiff, and more elastic31 which improved the mechanical strength of the DAO-PFPO-LCP (Fig. 4c). The TEOS played a crucial role in enhancing the mechanical stability of the as-prepared electrolytes. The mechanical property of the polymer composite film was increased with the addition of TEOS.53 The formation of Si–O–C and Si–O–Si bonds due to the silica and organic segments can be attributed to a more compatible and crosslinked network between organic and inorganic segments leading to high mechanical properties.54 Overall, the synthesized CSPEs show excellent mechanical stability compared to the previous CSPEs47–51,55 and can be smoothly used for battery assembly and operation, as well as for alleviating the possibility of short-circuit.
The suppression of polymeric matrix (PFPO and PVDF) crystallinity to enhance the percentage of the amorphous phase is a crucial design criterion for the SPEs.3 The effect of synthesized materials (i.e. Q-DAN, Q-DMP, and Q-DAO) along with the other precursors on the phase behavior of the as-prepared CSPEs was explored by DSC measurements (Fig. 4d). The DSC curves of the polymeric matrix and CSPEs are characterized by an endotherm peak at around 165–180 °C, corresponding to the melting transition of the crystalline state CSPEs. The melting point (Tm) of the as-prepared CSPEs was lower than that of the polymeric matrix (PVDF, PFPO) (Fig. 4d), implying the low crystallinity of the synthesized CSPEs.55 The zwitterionic structure of the CSEPs acts as a plasticizer to reduce the crystallinity degree of the polymeric matrix, and to enhance the polymeric segmental motion. These observations suggest that the zwitterionic structure of the CSPEs is an effective way to enhance the amorphous phase degree of the polymeric matrix, which is responsible for stimulating the Li+ ion motion through the polymer matrix. The phase transition behaviors of the as-prepared were further investigated by XRD. Fig. 4e illustrates the XRD patterns of CSPEs as well as the polymeric matrix. For the polymeric matrix (PVDF and PFPO), a sharp peak at 2θ = 20.3° illustrates the presence of the crystalline phase.55 However, this peak is increasingly broadened with significantly weakened intensity in the CSPEs, suggesting a higher degree of amorphous phase in the as-prepared CSPEs. The intensity of other peaks present in the polymeric matrix became less predominant and broader in the CSPEs.25,56 These observations suggest that the zwitterionic structure of the CSPEs hinders the crystallinity and enhances the segmental motion of the polymeric matrix, thereby increasing the Li+ ion conduction inside the synthesized CSPEs.
Electrochemical characteristics and cyclic voltammograms
The ionic conductivity and LTN are crucial assessment parameters (Fig. 4f) for the determination of high energy density of LIBs. The DN-PF-LCP exhibits higher ionic conductivity compared with other CSPEs at room temperature. The improved ionic conductivity of DN-PF-LCP may be due to the incorporation of Q-DAN and SSA that provide charge carriers inside the polymeric matrix to increase the ionic migration and degree of amorphicity. Moreover, the Q-DAN, SSA and TEOS impart close and regular distribution of anionic and cationic groups which effectively facilitate the transportation of Li+ ions. The greater ionic conductivity is also attributed to the super-delocalized and flexible nature of (CH3)3–N+–(CH2)–(CO)–, COO−–SO3−–COO−, and (CF3–SO2–N−–SO2–CF3) structures as well as the enhanced degree of dissociation of Li+ ions.57 The sulfonic, carboxylic, and imide groups upgrade the affinity of CSPEs toward polar solvents and enhance the ionic transport and lithium ionization and reduce the CSPE crystallinity as well as positively contributing to the ionic conductivity. Moreover, the inorganic precursor (TEOS) effectively improves the ionic conductivity of CSPEs by providing numerous hydrogen bonds.58 The incorporation of zwitterions could effectively increase the Li+ ion dissociation and provide strong coordinating interactions between sulfonate and carboxylate groups, as well as Li+ ions, while reducing bonding between the anionic center and Li+ ions in polymer backbones for accelerating the Li+ ion conduction mechanism. In contrast, DN-PF-LCP, DMP-PF-LCP, and DAO-PF-LCP CSPEs displayed the ionic conductivities of 8.69 × 10−4 S cm−1, 6.46 × 10−4 S cm−1, and 4.69 × 10−4, respectively at 25 °C and showed high ionic conductivities compared with DN-PFPO-LCP, DMP-PFPO-LCP and DAO-PFPO-LCP and other reported SPEs (Table S2†). But overall, the ionic conductivities were not affected too much due to the presence of the inorganic precursor, SSA, and synthesized functional moieties (i.e. Q-DAN, Q-DMP, and Q-DAO), as well as the zwitterionic structure of SPEs that facilitates the motion of polymer chains. The synthesized functional moieties, SSA, inorganic precursor, and polymeric matrix interact with TFSI−via hydrogen bonding that breaks the bond between Li+ and TFSI− to enhance the amount of free Li+ to improve the ion transport and electrochemical performance of the electrolytes.25 Moreover, the flexibility of the Si–O–Si network inside the polymer electrolytes delivers high ionic conductivity due to the greater segmental motion.3 The synthesized CSPEs containing zwitterions display a higher lithium diffusion coefficient, which promotes the ionic conductivity and shows that Li+ ions are only the mobile ionic species in the synthesized CSPEs. Therefore, the ionic conductivities of the synthesized CSPEs are greater than those of the reported CSPEs in the previous decade (Table S2†). Hence, the incorporation of TEOS, SSA, Q-DAN, Q-DMP, and Q-DAO inside the polymeric matrix positively contributes to the ionic conductivity.

Fig. 4g shows the ionic conductivity values of the CSPEs at various temperatures ranging from 25 to 80 °C. The Li+ ion mobility in CSPEs is simultaneously influenced by two opposing factors such as concentration and transport volume that are determined by the synthesized Q-DAN, Q-DMP, Q-DAO, TEOS, SSA, LiTFSI, PVDF, and PEO. The addition of Q-DAN, Q-DMP, Q-DAO, SSA, and LiTFSI may directly increase the number of charge carriers. In DN-PF-LCP, the adjacent benzene rings provide high electron delocalization and increase the dissociation of Li+ ions as well as uniformly distributing these ions by imparting more continuous paths for Li+ ion transportation at the molecular scale,56 thus providing it with the highest ionic conductivity values (8.69 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C and 2.83 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 80 °C). The aromatic groups and zwitterion increased the attraction of the polymer toward polar solvents that stimulate lithium ionization and ionic mobility as well as reducing the polymer crystallinity. DN-PF-LCP, DMP-PF-LCP, and DAO-PF-LCP CSPEs possess greater ionic conductivities compared to the others (i.e. DN-PFPO-LCP, DMP-PFPO-LCP, and DAO-PFPO-LCP) at various temperatures due to the increase in the degree of amorphicity and the absence of crystallinity of PEO as PEO strongly interacts with Li+ ions and reduces its diffusion coefficient as well as ionic conductivity. It has been observed that the ionic conductivity of 10−5 S cm−1 at 25 °C is considered to be an appropriate value for all-solid-state CSPEs.59 Hence, the fabricated CSPEs exhibit excellent ionic conductivity for their potential applications in LIBs.
Moreover, the electrochemical stability windows of the as-prepared CSPEs were examined by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), and the corresponding results are presented in Fig. 4h. The electrochemical windows of the synthesized CSPEs were in the range of 4.10–4.80 V, which are higher than those of PEO-RTIL-LiTFSI SPEs60 and ionic liquid-based SPEs.61 Among the synthesized CSPEs, DN-PF-LCP is electrochemically stable up to 4.8 V (Fig. 4h) which shows higher electrochemical oxidation-resistance compared with the previously reported studies.62–64 The higher electrochemical stability of the DN-PF-LCP is due to the C–O and OSO groups as these groups are hard to oxidize, so their strong electron-withdrawing ability may further lower the highest occupied molecular level of the molecule, resulting in the enhancement of the oxidation potential window of the DN-PF-LCP. Moreover, the zwitterionic structure of the DN-PF-LCP immobilizes the anions and prevents them from approaching the interface of the electrode, resulting in low anion concentration on the cathode and increasing the electrochemical stability. The zwitterionic structure of the CSPEs also effectively improves their electrochemical stability by facilitating the formation of the SEI film on the surface of the Li metal electrode and preventing the anions from coming into contact with the Li electrode.65 These observations show that as-prepared CSPEs have no obvious anodic current density corresponding to CSPE decomposition until 4.1 V (vs. Li/Li+), which demonstrates their good electrochemical stability and applicability in LIBs.
The interfacial stability of as-prepared CSPEs was examined against the lithium metal anode through voltage profiles using the symmetric Li/Li cell during the periodic galvanostatic discharge/charge (Fig. 4i). The symmetric Li/Li cell has undergone the charging and discharging process at constant current density (0.1 mA cm−2) and room temperature for 300 h. The symmetric Li/Li cells and the voltage profiles of galvanostatic discharge/charge for prepared CSPEs despite DAO-PFPO-LCP have favorable cycle performance without any short-circuiting, representing a highly stable plating/stripping reversibility.50 The impedance of Li|DN-PF-LCP|Li has no obvious change with the increase of time, representing no short-circuit phenomenon and suggesting a successful resistance of dendritic lithium formation due to the good interfacial compatibility of DN-PF-LCP CSPE (Fig. 6g–k). The Li|DAO-PFPO-LCP|Li cell cannot work after 180 h cycles, and this failure is caused by the short circuit arising from the continuous extension of dendritic lithium (Fig. 6l–p), while the initial impedances for the other CSPEs were greater at the initial stages and then become smooth for long term cycling. The initial impedance may be ascribed to the improvement of interfacial compactness with the SEI formation during long-term cycling. However, these CSPEs exhibit favorable cycle performance without any short-circuit, suggesting stable lithium plating/stripping reversibility and good interfacial compatibility between the Li metal anode and as-prepared CSPEs.
The electrochemical stability was examined via the cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique for the synthesized DN-PF-LCP (Fig. 5a), and other CSPEs (Fig. S5a–e†). The CV curves have almost similar shapes illustrating that the Q-DAN, Q-DMP, Q-DAO, SSA, and TEOS are not taking part in electrochemical reaction during the potential window of +2.5 to 4.2 V (vs. Li/Li+).66 The results show that the reversible redox couple peaks in the range of +3.298 and +3.5 V (vs. Li/Li+) were achieved for DN-PF-LCP (Fig. 5a) and are assigned to embedding and emergence process of Li+ ions in the anode electrode. CSPEs synthesized from Q-DAN, Q-DMP, Q-DAO, SSA, and TEOS are demonstrating a similar difference between reduction and oxidation peak potentials (ΔEp), i.e., +0.27 V, +0.29 V, +0.34 V, +0.41 V, +0.42 V, and +0.76 V (vs. Li/Li+) for DN-PF-LCP (Fig. 5a), DMP-PF-LCP, DAO-PF-LCP, DN-PFPO-LCP, DMP-PFPO-LCP, and DAO-PFPO-LCP CSPEs, respectively (Fig. S5a–e†). Furthermore, it has been observed that the reduction peaks of LiFePO4 with Q-DAN, Q-DMP, and Q-DAO are wide with low peak currents of 0.44 mA, 0.42 mA, 0.19 mA, 0.26 mA, 1.4 mA, and 0.38 mA for DN-PF-LCP (Fig. 5a), DMP-PF-LCP, DAO-PF-LCP, DN-PFPO-LCP, DMP-PFPO-LCP, and DAO-PFPO-LCP (Fig. S5a–e†) CSPEs, respectively.

Considering the case of LiFePO4 with Q-DAN, Q-DMP, Q-DAO, SSA, and TEOS, the peak currents are narrow with slightly higher peak currents 0.54 mA, 0.47 mA, 0.22 mA, 0.29 mA, 1.59 mA and 0.40 mA for DN-PF-LCP (Fig. 5a), DMP-PF-LCP, DAO-PF-LCP, DN-PFPO-LCP, DMP-PFPO-LCP, and DAO-PFPO-LCP CSPEs cyclic voltammograms, respectively (Fig. S5a–e†). These findings illustrate that during incorporating Q-DAN, Q-DMP, Q-DAO, SSA, and TEOS, the charge-transfer kinetics increased, representing that the developed electrodes using Q-DAN, Q-DMP and Q-DAO possess lower polarization and superior reversibility that may be assigned to the lowered resistance of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on LiFePO4 as well as charge transfer for Li+ ion intercalation and de-intercalation. Hence, there are no other obvious peaks except the two peaks for each CSPE (Fig. 5a and S5a–e†) that are assigned to the intercalation/de-intercalation of Li+ ions, demonstrating that there are no other side reactions in the voltage range for each fabricated CSPE.
Performance assessment and rate capability
The rate capability and cycling performance of the CSPEs were studied in Li/CSPE/LiFePO4 half-cells at 0.1–10C (Fig. 5b). During the successive C-rate cycling, the cells displayed stable charge/discharge capacities in cycling at each current rate. The greater reversible discharge capacities of the DN-PF-LCP half-cell are around 150, 144, 134, 127, 115, 90, and 55 mA h g−1 at discharge rates of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, and 10.0C, respectively (Fig. 5b). After the current rate and rate cycles return to 0.1C and 35 respectively, the discharge as well as charging capacities reached their original values. The increase in the charging and discharging rate could decrease the capacity of DN-PF-LCP while providing reversible discharge capacities (Fig. 5c). Similarly, reversible discharge capacities of the DMP-PF-LCP half-cell are approximately 140, 135, 128, 120, 108, 81, and 51 mA h g−1 at the discharge rate of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0 and 10.0C, respectively (Fig. 5b). Likewise, the DAO-PF-LCP exhibited reversible discharge capacities of the half-cell as 131, 128, 122, 117, 104, 74, and 34 mA h g−1 at the discharge rate of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0 and 10.0C, respectively (Fig. 5b). Similarly, for the other prepared CSPEs (i.e. DN-PFPO-LCP, DMP-PFPO-LCP and DAO-PFPO-LCP), their rate capability, as well as cycling performance at various current densities 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0 and 10.0C are shown in Fig. 5b, respectively. The discharge capacities of these CSPEs are uniform at their respective current densities as well as returning to their original values after 35 cycles of operation. Thus, the synthesized CSPEs exhibited good and uniform rate capability at higher current densities. The corresponding rate capacity of the DN-PF-LCP half-cell at each current density demonstrated a greater value in comparison with previously reported CSPEs for LIBs.44,50,58,67,68 In addition, the coulombic efficiency remained nearly 99% during the whole rate cycling process.
The battery performance of Li/CSPE/LiFePO4 half-cells with samples of DN-PF-LCP, DMP-PF-LCP, DAO-PF-LCP, DN-PFPO-LCP, DMP-PFPO-LCP and DAO-PFPO-LCP is investigated at 0.3C and room temperature (Fig. 5d). The LiFePO4 is selected as a cathode material for LIBs with a theoretical capacity (170 mA h g−1).69 The discharge capacities of DN-PF-LCP, DMP-PF-LCP and DAO-PF-LCP cells reached 136 mA h g−1, 130 mA h g−1, and 126 mA h g−1 and discharge capacities were retained at 131 mA h g−1, 115 mA h g−1, and 100 mA h g−1, respectively after 200 cycles at a current density of 0.3C (Fig. 5d). Among them, the discharge capacity of the DN-PF-LCP cell is maintained at ∼136 mA h g−1 during the whole cycling process without any obvious decay (Fig. 5e), while the coulombic efficiency is close to 100%. The cell test was prolonged up to 500 cycles, demonstrating excellent performance while maintaining a discharge capacity of 121 mA h g−1 throughout the cycling process at 0.3C and room temperature (Fig. 5f). The greater charge and discharge capacities are attributed to greater ionic conductivities, higher LTN, and stable interface layers for CSPEs in the cells. Moreover, the aromatic rings of Q-DAN and Q-DMP reduce the anion movement to enhance the negative charge dispersion, and thus improve the performance of DN-PF-LCP and DMP-PF-LCP compared with DAO-PF-LCP.70 In contrast, the discharge capacities of DN-PFPO-LCP, DMP-PFPO-LCP and DAO-PFPO-LCP cells reached 123 mA h g−1, 120 mA h g−1, and 119 mA h g−1 and discharge capacities were retained at 111 mA h g−1, 110 mA h g−1, and 109 mA h g−1, respectively (Fig. 5d) after 200 cycles at 0.3C. The reduction in charging and discharging capacities of DN-PFPO-LCP, DMP-PFPO-LCP and DAO-PFPO-LCP cells was due to the low ionic conductivity of PEO during cycling. Fig. 5g displays the rate performances of the Li/DN-PF-LCP/LiFePO4 cell for different current rates at 0.1–0.2C, 0.1–0.5C, and 0.1–2.0C. As the discharge/charge rate increases, the capacity of the LFP cell decreases, but overall, the Li/DN-PF-LCP/LiFePO4 cell exhibits stable charge/discharge capacities during the successive C-rates cycling after returning from 0.2C, 0.5C, and 2.0C current rates. The cell with DN-PF-LCP displays outstanding stability with the specific capacity remaining unchanged after returning to different C rates (0.2C, 0.5C, and 2.0C), representing the better electrochemical stability of the battery and negligible loss of the active materials. The excellent rate performance of this cell is mainly due to both the high ionic conductivity and the high LTN of the DN-PF-LCP. The rate capability for the coin cell with DN-PF-LCP confirms the good reversibility of the lithium ion intercalation process, indicating a well-connected ion transport network within the electrolyte and solid electrolyte interface.
Furthermore, the coulombic efficiency was analyzed using charging and discharging capacities and it was maintained close to 99% without obvious decay throughout the cycles for all the synthesized CSPEs (Fig. 5d). The corresponding cycle performance of the DN-PF-LCP half-cell is greater than those of the other reported CSPEs LIBs using the same anode (LFP) and cathode (Li metal) material.44,67,71 The synthesized functional group materials (i.e. Q-DAN, Q-DMP and Q-DAO), SSA and silica precursor play a vital role in facilitating the LIB performance as follows. Firstly, the fabricated CSPEs are compressible (Fig. 4c) and have uniform electrolyte membranes (Fig. 3), providing diverse interfacial stresses and imparting good interfacial contact due to their zwitterionic structures. Secondly, these can impede the growth of lithium dendrites (Fig. 3h–m and q–s) and hinder the anion movement for the application of CSPEs replacing dual-ion conductor SPEs to elude the short-circuit phenomenon (Fig. 1f and g). The anions may move freely and become away from the Li electrode that may cause a large electric field (Fig. 5h) and dendrite formation. Conversely, the anion movement is hindered inside the polymeric backbone due to its zwitterion for DN-PF-LCP (Fig. 5i) which impedes the building of the electric field and dendrite growth. Thirdly, the synthesized functional materials (i.e. Q-DAN, Q-DMP, and Q-DAO) synergistically boost the Li+ movement by reducing the PEO crystallinity and increasing the mobility of the segmental chain (Fig. 4d). With the outstanding ionic conductivity, LTN, electrochemical stability, and rate performance of the cell, the synthesized DN-PF-LCP demonstrates decent applicability for LIBs in the future.
Considering the above-mentioned promising features of the DN-PF-LCP, it may be produced on a large scale for practical applications, especially in a pouch cell. Since the pressure on lithium decreases in the pouch cell compared to the coin cell, which makes it easier to generate the lithium dendrite. However, the DN-PF-LCP CSPE is flexible and has mechanical and electrochemical stability with lithium, as well as being capable of impeding the lithium dendrite, so it could be used in a pouch cell with lithium metal. Therefore, the battery performance in a coin cell under practical conditions is recommended to predict the performance of the DN-PF-LCP or other strategies in pouch cells to bridge the gap between academic achievements and practical applications.
Investigation of the solid electrolyte interface and lithium dendrite growth
To investigate the formation mechanism of the SEI, the composition of the SEI layer on the used lithium metal of DN-PF-LCP after symmetric Li/Li cycling was investigated by XPS analysis (Fig. 6a–c). The C 1s peaks of C–F3, C–F2, Li–CO3, CO, C–O, C–OH, C–N, C–S, and C–C/C–H were located at the binding energy of 293, 290.5, 290, 288.2, 286.2, 285.8, 285.2, 284.9, and 284.5, indicating the formation of Li2CO3 due to the SEI film (Fig. 6a).72 Moreover, the O 1s fine spectra peaks at 533.2, 532.4, 532, 531.8 and 531.5 eV correspond to the C–O, SO, Li–CO3, CO, and Li–SO3, while the Li–CO3 and Li–SO3 were assigned to the SEI composition (Fig. 6b). For F 1s high-resolution spectra, the peaks at 689, 687.5 and 685 eV were attributed to C–F3, C–F2, and Li–F bonds (Fig. 6c), whereas the Li–F is ascribed to the SEI formation.73,74 The XPS spectra of the composition of the SEI layer on the used lithium metal of DN-PF-LCP were compared with those of the DN-PF-LCP CSPE (Fig. 6d–f), and it has been observed that the composition of the SEI layer could be identified as transformed Li2CO3 and LiF. Moreover, the deposition of organic polymer species and lithium salt would also facilitate the SEI generation process together with the Li2CO3 and LiF to establish a stable Li+ ion conductive shield between the anode and electrolyte.

SEM images of the (g) surface, and (h) the cross-section of DN-PF-LCP, and the (l) surface and (m) cross-section of DAO-PFPO-LCP assembled with the Li/Li symmetric cells after cycling. SEM micrographs of the interface between Li and CSPE for (i) DN-PF-LCP and (n) DAO-PFPO-LCP, and the used lithium metal foil surface of (j) DN-PF-LCP and (o) DAO-PFPO-LCP, and the cross-section of (k) DN-PF-LCP and (p) DAO-PFPO-LCP assembled with the Li/Li symmetric cells after cycling. 
Moreover, SEM characterization was also conducted to examine the distinct influences of synthesized DN-PF-LCP and DAO-PFPO-LCP CSPEs on Li metal cycling (Fig. 6g–p). Fig. 6g–k demonstrate the surface and cross-sectional morphology of the CSPE and Li metal foil in the symmetric Li/Li battery assembled with DN-PF-LCP, after cycling for 200 h at a current density of 0.1 mA cm−2. The lithium metal foil of the cell assembled with DN-PF-LCP exhibits a smoother and dense surface (Fig. 6j) and a cross-section (Fig. 6k) with a denser thinner (76 μm) SEI layer (Fig. 6i). Moreover, the surface and cross-section of the DN-PF-LCP CSPE are smooth and homogeneous without any cracks and dendritic growth (Fig. 6g and h). The denser SEI layer of the DN-PF-LCP CSPE was considered to restrain the growth of Li dendrites and further CSPE consumption.72,75 In comparison with DN-PF-LCP, the existence of irregular particles with inhomogeneous distribution on the surface and dendrites grew between DAO-PFPO-LCP and lithium metal foils present unstable lithium deposition during the plating/stripping process, while the morphology of used lithium metal foils showed smaller cracks and dendrites on the lithium surface and cross-section (Fig. 6o and p) and a 115 μm thick SEI layer (Fig. 6n), which would indicate that the formed thick but incompact SEI layer was electrochemically less stable, leading to further SEI thickening and consumption of DAO-PFPO-LCP. Considering these observations, the DN-PF-LCP exhibits low reactivity and provides a stable SEI layer, resulting in more stability against the lithium dendrite growth.
Conclusions
Novel functional materials including Q-DAN, Q-DMP and Q-DAO have been designed, synthesized, and studied by 1H NMR spectroscopy, and also used for the preparation of CSPEs to be potentially applied in LIBs. The DN-PF-LCP CSPE based on Q-DAN demonstrates outstanding ionic conductivity, excellent performance, and sufficient thermo-chemical stability at room temperature due to the hydrogen bonding and ion–dipole interactions which enhance the Li+ dissociation and ionic mobility, suggesting that the DN-PF-LCP CSPE can impede the formation and growth of lithium dendrites. The prepared CSPEs display high electrochemical stability up to 4.2 V vs. Li+/Li with no more than two obvious peaks of intercalation/de-intercalation exhibiting no side reactions in the voltage range from 2.4 to 4.2 V. Moreover, the DN-PF-LCP CSPE exhibits outstanding ionic conductivity (8.69 × 10−4 S cm−1) at 25 °C to enhance the ionic transport, excellent thermo-stability up to ∼420 °C to be safe against electrical short-circuit, and superior mechanical stability with strain 40.55% and stress 1.08 MPa to be flexible and withstand stress conditions during the cell packaging and usage. The zwitterionic structure of the DN-PF-LCP CSPE boosts the disintegration of Li+ ions and hinders the crystallinity of the polymeric matrix to augment the polymeric segmental motion which promotes the ionic conduction through DN-PF-LCP. The assembled LiFePO4/DN-PF-LCP/Li cell provides a capacity of 136 mA h g−1 and coulombic efficiency of 99.5% with a capacity retention of 96% at a higher current rate of 0.3C after 200 cycles at room temperature. These outstanding characteristics of DN-PF-LCP make it promising as a CSPE to promote the development of safe and high-performance LIBs.
