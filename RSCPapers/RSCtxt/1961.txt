Introduction
Since the discovery of nanotechnology, numerous studies have been carried out to develop novel synthetic methods for preparing size- and shape-controlled nanomaterials with desirable functional performance. Nanofabrication is defined as the design, construction, and manipulation of materials with dimensions in the small range of 1 to 100 nm. In general, the synthesis of nanomaterials can be achieved by top-down and bottom-up methods.1 The top-down approach produces nanosized particles by miniaturizing bulk particles with the use of physical-based (e.g., optical lithography, electron beam lithography, ion beam lithography) or chemical-based approaches (e.g., template-based etching, chemical dealloying, anisotropic dissolution). The main drawbacks of the top-down methods include high energy consumption and the need for expensive equipment and facilities. Nonetheless, the physical top-down approach is commonly used in microelectronic industries. In contrast, the bottom-up approach relies on the self-assembly of molecules as a result of the physical or chemical interactions at the nanoscale level to form nanostructures. Similar as the top-down approach, the bottom-up approach can also be classified into two main categories: physical (e.g., physical vapor deposition, atomic layer deposition) and chemical-based bottom-up approaches (e.g., hydrothermal, polyol, sol–gel, microemulsion, sonochemical, and electrodeposition).2,3 The bottom-up methods offer more control over the size, shape, and composition of nanostructures and do not require expensive equipment or facilities; hence they are more suitable for large-scale production.
In the past decade, metal oxide nanomaterials have been extensively investigated owing to their large surface-to-volume ratio and unique physical and chemical properties compared to bulk oxides.4 These distinct properties have been exploited for a wide variety of applications, including energy storage and conversion, sensors, environmental remediation, optoelectronics, biomedical, etc. To date, metal oxide nanostructures have been synthesized by both physical and chemical-based bottom-up approaches, however the physical-based ones typically require complex and expensive instruments and high pressure and/or temperature.5 In general, the chemical-based bottom-up approaches are preferred for the synthesis of metal oxide nanostructures, owing to low growth temperature, cost-effectiveness, and better potential for mass production.6–10 However, many chemical bottom-up methods typically employ hazardous solvents or toxic chemical compounds as surfactants or capping agents which are environmentally unfriendly and difficult to degrade. Furthermore, the chemical waste produced from the manufacture of metal oxides can have harmful effects on human health and environment. Such chemical waste can be in the form of harmful gases emitted into the atmosphere, liquids that pollute groundwater, and solids that generally fill the soil, leading to ground and water pollution. Therefore, efforts to reduce the use of hazardous chemicals in the fabrication of metal oxide nanostructures are very necessary through green chemistry.
Green synthesis or ‘green chemistry’ is defined as a set of principles or practices that encourage the design or products and processes that reduce or eliminate the use and generation of dangerous and hazardous compounds.11 The green synthesis of metal oxide nanostructures, therefore involves benign approaches which utilize moderate reaction conditions and non-toxic precursors.12 In recent developments of green chemistry, researchers have employed naturally occurring resources, non-hazardous compounds, or biocompatible and biodegradable materials as well as energy-efficient processes for synthesizing metal oxide nanostructures.13 Among naturally occurring compounds, phytochemicals or organic compounds extracted from plants have emerged as attractive agents or chemicals for the synthesis of metal oxide nanostructures owing to their low cost, eco-friendliness, wide abundance, and sustainability.14Table 1 summarizes previously reported metal oxide nanostructures synthesized by using leaf extracts. Plants contain various phytochemicals and biomolecules, such as proteins, amino acids, vitamins, polysaccharides, polyphenols, terpenoids, and organic acids. These molecules or compounds can be used to synthesize or stabilize metal oxide nanostructures. Furthermore, plant derivatives are believed to be superior in accelerating the rate of metal ion reduction compared to microorganisms, and better for producing metal oxide nanostructures with distinct morphologies and improved stability.15 However, the synthesis of metal oxide nanostructures by using plant-derived phytochemicals typically requires longer time due to the need to extract, isolate, and purify the phytochemicals.12

Metal oxide nanostructures prepared through green routes have shown excellent promise for various applications. These green-synthesized metal oxide materials have shown increased biocompatibility for biomedical applications than those prepared by conventional chemical methods.16,19,23,25 Furthermore, due to the intrinsic properties of metal oxide nanostructures, they have also been applied in other applications, such as environmental remediation24 for removal of heavy metals and decompositions of organic dyes with the assistance of visible or ultraviolet (UV) light (photodegradation). In addition, green-synthesized metal oxide nanostructures have also been employed for energy storage devices (e.g., supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries) and for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) and showed improved performance compared to bulk metal oxides.20,29
In brief, this perspective is divided into several sections. The first section deals with the preparation of metal oxide nanostructures through green synthetic routes. The second section discusses the growth mechanisms of metal oxide nanostructures prepared by using phytochemicals and the role of phytochemicals in the formation of these oxide materials. The third section covers the applications of metal oxide nanostructures synthesized via green chemistry in energy, environmental, and bio-related fields. Finally, some perspectives and future directions on the green synthesis of metal oxide nanomaterials are given.
Synthesis of metal oxide nanostructures using natural agents
Biological substances, such as plants, fungus, bacteria, and algae, have attracted great interest as natural reducing and stabilizing agents for the green and eco-friendly synthesis of metal oxide nanostructures.39,40 In this section, various synthetic methods for synthesizing metal oxides nanostructures using natural agents are discussed. The natural agents can be sourced from parts of plants (such as leaves, flower petals, roots, rhizomes, branches, and fruit peels) or vegetables. Plants and vegetables are known to contain biologically active compounds known as phytochemicals (e.g., anthocyanins, carotenoids, flavonoids, isoflavones, organic sulfides, xanthophyll, etc.), which can be utilized the synthesis of metal oxide nanostructures. To obtain such phytochemicals, several important steps are required, including extraction, isolation, purification, and characterization of the compound of interest.41 The general extraction protocol is schematically illustrated in Scheme 1. In the first step, typically the plant parts are thoroughly washed with tap and distilled water to completely remove unwanted materials. The washed plant parts are then dried and reduced to smaller pieces by cutting or grinding into powder. The conventional extraction process typically involves boiling the small-sized plant parts in an appropriate solvent (e.g., water, ethanol, etc.) to ensure high extraction efficiency without damaging the phytochemicals. Several previous reports have revealed that polar solvents are more suitable for extracting polar substances from plant parts, whereas non-polar solvents are more appropriate for extracting non-polar substances.42 A mixture solvent consisting of water and alcohol in varied ratios typically achieves a higher extraction yield, owing to the expanded polarity range.
 Scheme 1  Schematic diagram showing the general steps for obtaining phytochemicals from plants. 
Many previous reports have employed the solvent extraction method to extract the desired phytochemicals from plants.43–46 For instance, Jafarirad et al. extracted the natural agents from Rosa canina fruit flesh to prepare zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs).47 The fruit flesh was dried at room temperature, weighed, and ground into powder prior to mixing with deionized water for 24 h. The mixture was then heated at 50 °C for 15 min and the successful extraction was indicated by the visual change in color of the mixture into light red. Karnan et al. utilized the extract of Nephelium lappaceum L. fruit peels to synthesize ZnO NPs.48 To obtain the extract, the peels were washed thoroughly and subsequently cut into small pieces and dried at 50 °C. The dried peels were then boiled in a mixture of water and ethanol (2:1) for 10 min with the temperature maintained at 80 °C. Further, Devipriya and co-workers utilized the leaf extract of Cissus quadrangularis to prepare cupric oxide (CuO) NPs.49 The aqueous extract was prepared by boiling the leaf powder in distilled water for 1 h, followed by filtration and centrifugation.
Compared to the conventional solvent extraction method, advanced extraction methods, such as microwave-assisted extraction, ultrasonic-assisted extraction, supercritical fluid extraction, and solid-phase micro-extraction offer some advantages, including lower consumption of solvent, faster extraction, and efficient elimination of unwanted and insoluble substances from the extract.50 Rajabi and co-workers previously obtained an aqueous extract of Suaeda aegyptiaca by employing microwave-assisted extraction method.51 To obtain the extract, the ground and dried plant powder was mixed with double distilled water and then irradiated under various power for 15 min using microwave apparatus. Once the phytochemicals are extracted, the isolation was performed via filtration. The isolation method to obtain the highest purity and yield of phytochemicals depends on the nature and the raw source of the compound.52 To further understand the role of plant extracts in the green synthesis of metal oxide nanostructures, it is important to identify the major compounds or the functional groups present on these extracts. The identification process can be carried out by using various chromatographic and spectroscopic analytical techniques (e.g., high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPTLC), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometer (LC-MS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, etc.).53
Phytochemicals play important roles as reducing and capping agents in the synthesis of metal oxide NPs. The shape and size of the resulting metal oxide NPs are dependent on the facet-specific binding of the phytochemical.54 Theoretical simulations (e.g., density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations) are powerful techniques which can be used to predict the preferential binding of a particular phytochemical on metal oxide facets, and therefore, to predict the possible morphology of the resulting metal oxide products.
To date, many reported works on the green synthesis of metal oxide nanostructures have relied on conventional heating, microwave irradiation, and ultrasound-assisted methods. The conventional heating method involves the reduction of metal salts in the solution and crystal growth occurs with the assistance of heat generated by water or oil bath. Typically, a mixture of the plant extract solution and the metal salt solution with a specific volume ratio is heated in the temperature range of 40–150 °C for 2–48 h. The transformation of metal ions to metal hydroxide can occur when there are sufficient hydroxyl groups present in the plant extract solution. The metal hydroxide precipitate is then heated at temperatures ranging between 300–500 °C to obtain the desired metal oxide nanostructures. The detailed role of phytochemicals as capping or stabilizing agents in the formation of metal oxide nanostructures will be described in the later section of this perspective.
The rapid reduction and precipitation of metal hydroxide/metal oxide NPs can be achieved by either microwave irradiation or ultrasonication. A previous report on the synthesis of ZnO NPs assisted by microwave irradiation revealed that the precipitation could be obtained after the mixture of plant extract and metal salt solution was subjected to microwave irradiation for 4 × 2 min at 320 W.47 Sathya and co-workers reported the synthesis of iron oxide NPs with the assistance of Coriandrum sativum leaf extract and the precipitation of the NPs was achieved by ultrasonication at a frequency of 33 ± 3 kHz.55 The ultrasonication method therefore provides a rapid approach for synthesizing a variety of metal oxide NPs.
Growth mechanisms of phytochemical-derived metal oxide nanostructures
Understanding the growth mechanisms of metal oxide NPs synthesized with the aid of natural agents are quite challenging due to the various chemical compounds present in leaf extracts. These compounds can take on the roles of reducing agents, catalysts, capping agents and/or chelating agents in the formation of metal oxide NPs. One or more roles can be assumed by a single natural agent to promote the formation of uniform particle shape and size during the crystal growth process. This section will explain the detailed roles of phytochemicals in the preparation of metal oxide NPs, as reported in previous studies.
Reducing agent
Reducing agent is used to reduce metal ion species.39,56–58 The reduction process strongly depends on the reduction potential of the involved species.57 Natural reducing agents have previously been used for synthesizing metal NPs (e.g., platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), silver (Ag) and gold (Au) NPs) due to the positive reduction potential of these metal ions and the easily oxidized nature of the natural agent. The natural agent can also be used to reduce metal ion to the desired oxidation state before they transform to metal oxide.39,56–58 Generally, phytochemicals from plants contain antioxidants (e.g., polyphenols) can help to reduce and stabilize metal ions to prevent agglomeration so that stable metal NPs can be obtained.59–61 In the formation of metal oxide nanostructures, the reducing agent is used to reduce metal ions in the solution to metal NPs. The oxidation of the metal to metal oxide is typically achieved by calcination in air or oxygen-rich atmosphere.
Catalyst
Natural agents can also be used to catalyze the formation of metal oxide. In general, the oxide formation begins with the bonding of metal ion center to hydroxide ion (OH−) to form metal hydroxide. Hydroxide ion sources, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH), ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), urea (CO(NH2)2), and hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) are usually required as catalysts to accelerate the nucleation and formation of metal hydroxides, which in turn leads to easier formation of metal oxides. Currently, the exact mechanism of metal oxide formation assisted by natural agents is still unclear. Previous studies reported that phytochemicals can serve as catalysts for the metal oxide formation. Aloe barbadensis Miller extract was previously used to replace NaOH in the formation of CuO with CuSO4 as the Cu source. Without calcination, spherical CuO NPs with sizes between 15–30 nm were obtained and no aggregation was observed (Fig. 1a).21Aloe vera has also been employed in the synthesis of ZnO NPs.32 Impressively, a high yield of more than 90% was achieved within a short reaction time of 6 h using Aloe vera extract, whereas a lower yield of 50% was achieved with NaOH. These ZnO NPs had an average size of 35 nm and were well-separated (Fig. 1b). Aloe vera has been reported to contain some active constituents, including vitamins, enzymes, minerals, sugar, lignin, saponin, salicylic acid, and amino acids and their synergetic effects may have promoted the formation of CuO and ZnO NPs.62 The free amino acids and carboxylic groups present in phenolic compounds were thought to be responsible for hindering the aggregation of the oxide NPs.

Capping agent
Capping agent is defined as a compound which suppresses particle growth by passivating the surface of particles, reducing the surface energy of particles so that aggregation can be avoided.63 Generally, capping agents or surfactants are often used to control the crystal growth of NPs. There is a very strong relationship between the particle size and the size of the surfactant or capping agent. Basically, the larger the size of the capping agent, the smaller the size of the obtained NPs. In general, plant extracts contain flavonoids and phenolic acids which can act as reducing and capping agents at once. Therefore, plant extracts have been widely used as supporting agents for producing metal NPs, such as Ag and Ni NPs.64,65 Maqbool et al. used O. europaea extract as both reducing and capping agents in the growth process of cerium oxide (CeO2) and Ag NPs. O. europaea extract was found to contain oleuropein and oleuroside as main constituents, with a little amount of rutin, oleuropeoside, luteolin 7-O-glucoside, and apigenin 7-O-glucoside.66 In the growth process, oleuropein was decomposed into elenolic acid and hydroxytyrosol, which can act as organic capping agents (Fig. 2). Other compounds which are present in the extract as organic impurities did not influence the crystal growth of the NPs. The resulting CeO2 and Ag NPs exhibited average sizes of 18 and 26 nm, respectively.

Several plant extracts have been successfully used to control or modify the morphology of metal oxide nanostructures. Santhoskumar et al. employed Passiflora caerulea extract to synthesize ZnO NPs with an average size ∼70 nm.30 It was shown that spherical NPs have a strong tendency to agglomerate because of their high surface energy. This problem can be solved by adding the plant extract and controlling its concentration. The Passiflora caerulea extract could passivate the surface of the NPs, thereby hindering agglomeration.67 In other report, ZnO NPs with diameters in the range of 12–26 nm (Fig. 3b) were obtained by using Agathosma betulina leaf extract.31 From the TEM image shown in Fig. 3a, the resulting ZnO NPs appear to aggregate, meaning that the extract did not completely chelate the metal precursor. Phytochemicals existing in the Agathosma betulina extract acted as chelating agents that could control the growth of the particles. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern revealed that these ZnO NPs were crystalline (Fig. 3c). Sangeetha et al. utilized the leaf extracts of Aloe barbandesis to produce spherical ZnO NPs with sizes in the range of 25–55 nm.32 The extracts contained phenols and proteins which served as active capping agents for preventing the agglomeration of the particles, while also stabilizing them in nanosized form. The utilization of proteins existing in plants for the synthesis of metal oxide NPs has been demonstrated by Azizi et al.33 They used palm pollen in the preparation of ZnO NPs with an average size of 15 nm. The study claimed that carbohydrates, protein, amino acid, lipid, vitamin, and polyphenol substances which were present in the extract helped to stabilize the formed ZnO NPs. Ultrasmall particles of ZnO were previously prepared by using Apalathus linearis extract.34 This natural capping agent could reduce the size of the formed ZnO NPs all the way down to 1 nm, however there was a small tendency to agglomerate. It was theorized that Apalathus linearis contained unique organic compounds, such as C–C dihydrochalcone glycoside and chalcone (nothofagin and aspalalinin) which contributed to the formation of the ZnO NPs. Apart from spherical NPs, the formation of ZnO minirods has previously been achieved by using Ocimum basilicum L. var. purpurascens Benth.-Lamiaceae leaf extract.36 Linalool compound from terpene alcohol was thought to be responsible for the formation of rod-like ZnO with an average diameter of 50 nm.

The leaf extracts of Gloriosa superba L. and Hibiscus sabdariffa have been successfully utilized as capping agents in the synthesis of spherical CeO2 NPs. The average sizes of the CeO2 spheres were 5 nm and 3.9 nm for those obtained using Gloria superba L. and Hibiscus sabdariffa leaf extracts, respectively.16,17 The attainment of very small particles proved that phytochemicals existing in both plants could act as excellent capping agents to stabilize the surface of the particles and limit aggregation. H. sabdariffa contain some compounds which are believed acted as a capping agent. The existing compounds in these leaf extracts include phenols (citric acid, hydroxy citric acid, and hibiscus acid), and flavonoids (quercetin, luteolin or gossypetin and their respective glycosides, and anthocyanin) which acted in synergy to form very small particles of CeO2.68 Moreover, the presence of carbohydrates, alkaloids, steroids, and terpenoids that were found in the Gloriosa superba L. leaf extract may also have served as capping agents to stabilize the formation of ultrasmall particles of CeO2.69
Chelating agent
The formation of metal oxide can occur initially through the formation of a metal complex. Therefore, the utilization of a chelating or complexing agent can significantly affect the morphology of the resulting metal oxide nanostructures. As discussed earlier, plant extracts contain many organic compounds, such as phenols, proteins, and carbohydrates. Among these, phenols are typically the dominant phytochemicals found in plant extracts. Phenols, especially the deprotonated ones, are very good for promoting metal chelation due to their high charge density.70 Furthermore, as hard ligands, phenols can interact with metal cations of high charge density, such as Fe2+, Fe3+, Cu2+, Al3+, and Zn2+. Flavonoids contain many phenols which can bind easily with metal ions. The binding or chelate site will depend on the acidity of the system.71 Yuvakkumar and co-workers utilized ellagic acid extracted from Korean rambutan peel to obtain chain-like ZnO.37 Ellagic acid is a natural phenol antioxidant commonly found in fruits and nuts, such as strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, and walnuts.72 This compound was found to bind with some metals, such as Cu, Cr, and Zn to form metal complexes by anion exchange between metal ions and H+ in hydroxyl sites. One zinc anion might bind with two ellagic acid at one end and this zinc ellagate could repeat this binding, leading to the formation of a chain-like structure. This chain-like structure did not change during the transformation process at 450 °C in air.37 Furthermore, the authors also performed the same synthesis with rambutan peel which was grown in India. Surprisingly, different origin place of plants could result in different morphology. The utilization of the Indian rambutan peel extract led to generation of ZnO nanoneedles and flake-like particles with low degree of uniformity (Fig. 4a).38 The main compound present in the Indian rambutan peel extract was found to be geraniin. This phenomenon highlighted the important role of ellagic acid in the formation of the chain-like ZnO (Fig. 4b). Proteins found in plant extracts may also play important roles in the formation of metal oxide nanostructures. In proteins, metal cations are most likely to interact with donor atoms in the functional groups of amino acid side chains, imidazole nitrogen of histidine, sulphur of cysteine, carboxylate oxygen of aspartic or glutamic acids (one or both oxygen) or oxygen of threonine or serine.73 In addition, they can also interact with the main chain carbonyl oxygen of any amino acid residue. Again, the deprotonated group or donor atom is the more favorable chelating site. However, one should note that the chelating site also depends on the metal properties. Apart from proteins and carbohydrates, sugar derivatives (e.g., glucose, fructose, sucrose, and starch) have been reported to bind with metals, which led to different morphologies, depending on the chain length. Some sites in glucose can act as chelation sites to form metal complexes.74 Fructose has also been reported to act as a structure-directing agent in the formation of metal oxide.75 Under hydrothermal conditions, fructose would form spherical particles and adsorb metal on its surface. Through carbonization followed by calcination in air, the formation of metal oxide sphere occurred.

Due to the existence of many phytochemicals in plant extracts, the determination of the exact mechanism by which phytochemicals assisted with the formation of metal oxide nanostructures is very challenging, unless one can isolate one specific compound from these phytochemicals. Various active organic compounds existing in plant extracts cannot only act as reducing agents but also as capping agents to stabilize and prevent the aggregation of metal oxide NPs. Low molecular weight organic acids, such as oxalate found in Rumex acetosa extract was previously used to reduce iron(III) to iron(II), leading to the formation of Fe3O4.76 Oxalate ions can react with Fe3+ to generate CO32− and Fe2+. The extract was added to the iron(III) chloride solution and the reducing process as well as the formation of Fe3O4 was indicated by the color change from yellow to intense brown. During the formation process, oxalate ions could bind electrostatically with the surface of iron oxide NPs, therefore preventing their aggregation.
Applications of metal oxide nanostructures synthesized by green chemistry
In this section, the various prospective applications of metal oxide nanostructures synthesized using natural agents will be discussed. The prospective applications rely on the intrinsic properties of the metal oxides, such as shape and size of the NPs and the biologically active compound(s) which may reside on the metal oxide surface during the synthesis process.
Bio-related applications
Antimicrobial is an agent that kills or stop the growth of microorganisms. Many metal oxide NPs synthesized by green chemistry exhibit high antimicrobial activity towards various bacterial strains, fungi, algae, and even insects. ZnO NPs synthesized by using hot water extract of Sargassum wightii were previously found to possess anti-biofilm activities against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative biofilm-forming bacterial pathogens. In addition, the resulting ZnO NPs were extremely stable and had significant larvicidal activity against Aedes aegypti.77 ZnO NPs prepared with the assistance of Rosa canina fruit extract was also investigated against several bacterial strains, including Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhimurium.47 Furthermore, Trifolium pretense mediated ZnO NPs have been reported to exhibit antimicrobial activity against clinical and standard strains of Staphylococcus aureus and P. aeruginosa and standard strain of Escherichia coli.78 Furthermore, CuO NPs synthesized by using Seidlitzia rosmarinus were reported to show sophisticated antibacterial properties against both Staphylococcus aureus as a Gram-positive and Escherichia coli as a Gram-negative bacteria.79 The bactericidal activity of natural agent-mediated ZnO NPs was attributed to the disruption of bacterial cell membranes by the production of reactive oxygen species, intracellular depletion and disruption of DNA replication by ZnO NPs as well as cytoplasmic leakage, leading to the death of the bacterium (Fig. 5).80

Recently, CuO NPs synthesized by employing gum karaya obtained from Sterculia tree were shown to exhibit algicidal properties towards a unicellular green algae (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii), which is commonly found in the swimming pool.81 The natural tree gum consists of galactose, rhamnose, galacturonic acid, uronic acid residues, and acetyl groups which have been studied toxicologically and considered as non-toxic. The prepared CuO NPs could greatly reduce the growth rate of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii from 1 × 106 cells per h to 0.2 × 104 cells per h (P < 0.001). Furthermore, green-synthesized metal oxide NPs have also demonstrated antifungal properties against fungal pathogens in plants, such as Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger. Parthenium hysterophorus L. mediated ZnO NPs and Cissus quadrangularis mediated CuO NPs were shown to be good antifungal agents and environmentally friendly.49,81
Environmental remediation
The introduction of heavy metals (such as Pb, Hg, As, Cd, and Cr) into the water bodies (e.g., lakes, rivers, etc.) poses serious environmental threats and health problems as they can easily accumulate in living organisms. Venkateswarlu et al. reported the first successful green synthesis of 1D Fe3O4 magnetic nanorods by using Punica granatum rind extract as the reducing agent, which showed high adsorption capacity for removal of Pb(II) from aqueous environment.24 It is worth noting that the regenerated adsorbents could still be used for Pb(II) removal, indicating the good reusability of these nanorods. Later, another group also reported the application of Fe3O4 NPs prepared by using Averrhoa carambola leaf extract for Cr(VI) photoreduction and phenol photodegradation.82 Interestingly, the combination of the magnetic Fe3O4 NPs with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) led to high efficiency in phenol degradation (76%) and Cr(VI) reduction (97%), respectively (Fig. 6a and b). The higher activity of the Fe3O4/RGO hybrid presumably was attributed to the in situ loading of RGO and the synergism developed between RGO and the magnetic Fe3O4 NPs, which resulted in better separation of photoexcited charge carriers (e−/h+) based on photoluminescence and photocurrent measurements.82 As one of the most toxic pollutants, arsenic may be present in the environment as anionic species. Martínes-Cabanaz et al. previously reported the effective removal of arsenic by using biosynthesized iron oxide NPs encapsulated in a chitosan matrix.83 The large-scale sorption capacity for arsenic was also demonstrated in a continuous flow study by using a column filled with beads of this magnetic hybrid material. Other green-synthesized metal oxide NPs, such as CuO NPs have also been shown to be efficient in separating Cr(VI) from contaminated water.84

Metal oxide NPs, especially ZnO and TiO2, are well-known as some of the prominent photocatalysts in water remediation applications via photodegradation since they are inexpensive, non-toxic, and chemically and mechanically stable.85 Methylene blue is one of the main water pollutants released by textile industries. Previously, ZnO NPs fabricated using Azadirachta indica, Conyza canadensis, and Tabernaemontana divaricata extracts were shown to exhibit high photocatalytic activity for the degradation of MB under UV light.86–88 In another study, ZnO NPs synthesized with the assistance of Nephelium lappaceum L. extract could effectively degrade methyl orange (MO) dye under UV light with a high removal efficiency of around 84% within 2 h.48 Recently, NiO NPs prepared by using Calotropis gigantea extract also displayed excellent photocatalytic performance for the removal of MB under UV light with an impressive degradation efficiency of 98.6% within 5 min.25 The effective utilization of biosynthesized iron oxide NPs for the photodegradation of rhodamine B (RhB) dye has also been demonstrated.23
Photochemical hydrogen (H2) generation
The light harvesting and H2 evolution by photochemical water splitting is one of the potential applications of metal oxide NPs.89 Archana et al. successfully synthesized ZnO NPs via green chemistry by employing Moringa oleifera tree extract.90 The synthesized ZnO NPs had a spherical morphology with diameters of around 20–120 nm. Photocatalytic H2 evolution measurements were conducted in an aqueous solution containing Na2S and Na2SO3 as sacrificial agents under UV irradiation. Fig. 7 shows the photocatalytic hydrogen production mechanism for the designed photocatalyst in the presence of these sacrificial agents. The bombardment of light towards ZnO NPs surface generated holes and electrons. The generated holes and electrons participated in the redox processes at the ZnO NPs/solution interface. Water molecules reacted with the holes to generate hydroxyl radical and H+ ions. While Na2S and Na2SO3 solutions act as hole scavengers. The photocatalytic H2 evolution measurements revealed the superior performance of ZnO NPs compared to commercial bulk ZnO. The improvement in the photocatalytic activity of ZnO NPs was attributed to the presence of oxygen vacancies, as suggested by the red-shift in the band gap of the ZnO NPs compared to bulk ZnO.91 Further, Ismail et al. successfully synthesized ruthenium(IV) oxide (RuO2) NPs with the assistance of Aspalathus linearis leaf extract.92 In the synthesis process, the leaf extract served as chelating and capping agents in the formation of quasi-monodispersed RuO2 NPs with an average diameter of 2.15 nm. The surface area of the green-synthesized RuO2 NPs was found to be as high as 136.1 m2 g−1, which was ∼12.5 times larger than that of commercial RuO2 (11.0 m2 g−1). Using the Tauc plot, the band gap of the green-synthesized RuO2 NPs was found to be ∼2.1 eV. These RuO2 NPs were employed for photochemical water splitting and they were shown to effectively decrease the activation energy for hydrogen gas evolution. This phenomenon occurred because the RuO2 NPs could provide numerous reaction sites for the photocatalytic water decomposition.

Energy storage
Transition metal oxides NPs have been considered as potential electrode materials for pseudocapacitors. RuO2 is environmentally-benign and has been reported to possess high specific capacitance and fast reversible redox process. Ismail et al. successfully fabricated RuO2 NPs on nickel foam (NiF) by using the extract of Aspalathus linearis as both reducing and capping agents.29 The electrochemical performance was investigated by using a three-electrode configuration. The synthesized NiF/RuO2 exhibited a high specific capacitance of 750 F g−1 at a current density of 10 A g−1. Furthermore, the NiF/RuO2 electrode also showed excellent rate capability with high capacitance retention of ∼97.5% at a current density of 10 A g−1. These results clearly highlight the promising potential of green-synthesized transition metal oxide NPs for supercapacitor applications. In another report, wire-like MnO2 was prepared by using orange peel and orange juice extracts and successfully utilized as an electrode material for supercapacitors.93 The phytochemicals present in the orange peel and orange juice extracts were believed to take part in the formation of fine interconnected MnO2 nanowires. The electrochemical measurements showed that the MnO2 nanowire electrode exhibited a respectable capacitance of 139 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1.
Transition metal oxide NPs, such as MnO2 and TiO2, are frequently explored as alternative anode materials to graphitic carbon for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). For instance, Hashem et al. prepared nanosized MnO2 by employing citrus peel extracts.94 The antioxidant moieties found in citrus peel extract include flavonoid glycoside, p-coumaric acid, and β-sitosterol. The biosynthesized MnO2 displayed high crystallinity and consists of fairly uniform nanorods with average diameter and length of 17 and 150 nm, respectively. The morphology was found to be similar to that prepared by conventional hydrothermal method, which typically involved harmful reactants. The nanosized MnO2 showed improved electrochemical properties with good rate capability and reversible capacity which was maintained at 160 mA h g−1 (initial capacity of 212 mA h g−1) at a high current density of 10 mA g−1. In another report, MnO2 NPs were successfully synthesized by using black tea leaves (denoted as BT-MnO2) and green tea leaves (GT-MnO2).95 The polyphenols present in the tea extracts acted as both reducing and capping agents, which stabilized and prevented the aggregation of the formed MnO2 NPs. The electrochemical properties and the discharge performance of the green-synthesized MnO2 samples for LIBs were investigated. The results revealed the higher initial capacity of BT-MnO2 (∼231 mA h g−1) compared to GT-MnO2 (214 mA h g−1). However, GT-MnO2 exhibited better capacity retention (73% after 20 cycles at current density 10 mA g−1) than BT-MnO2 (62% after 20 cycles). The energy storage performance of were comparable to the electrode materials prepared through conventional and more expensive methods which utilize chemical reducing agents.
Kashale et al. successfully prepared pure and Cu-doped TiO2 NPs by using Bengal gram bean (C. arietinum L.) extract.96 The biomolecules contained in the extract played significant roles in preventing the agglomeration of the particles and controlling the size of the NPs. The particle size of the bio-synthesized TiO2 NPs varies between 9 to 12 nm. Apart from pure TiO2, the TiO2 NPs were also modified with copper dopants (3% and 7%). Among the three prepared TiO2 NPs, the 7% Cu-doped TiO2 NPs showed better charge–discharge capacity than the pure TiO2 and 3% Cu-doped TiO2, owing to the synergistic effect between Cu and TiO2 and the enhanced conductivity. The 7% Cu-doped TiO2 NPs could achieve a high capacity of 250 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 with a capacity retention of 97.6% after 100 cycles. The successful preparation of several transition metal oxide NPs using naturally-derived phytochemicals may play an important role in the sustainable development of future electrode materials for energy storage applications, due to the economical and eco-friendly nature of green synthesis.
Conclusions
The utilization of green and renewable phytochemicals found in plants provides a more sustainable and environmentally friendly way to synthesize metal oxide nanostructures compared to conventional chemical methods. To date, a variety of metal oxide nanostructures, including CuO, ZnO, FexOy, MgO, and CeO2 have been successfully synthesized with the assistance of naturally-derived phytochemicals. The phytochemicals in plant extracts typically contain phenols and proteins which can act as capping agents, reducing agents and/or complexing agents. The synergistic combination of these phytochemicals may lead to the creation of metal oxide nanostructures with controlled size or shape. Generally, green synthesis is performed by means of precipitation, involving only water or alcohol as the medium. Owing to the presence of phenols in plant extracts, antibacterial agent is one of the most popular applications for metal oxide nanostructures synthesized by green routes. Furthermore, green-synthesized metal oxide NPs have found applications in heavy metal adsorption, hydrogen generation, and energy storage devices (supercapacitors and batteries). Although the green synthesis of metal oxide nanomaterials offers the benefits of sustainability and environmental friendliness, it also has some limitations, including the need to extract, isolate, and purify the phytochemicals, unclear mechanism, and difficulty in isolating one specific compound from the phytochemicals. Therefore, in the future, more detailed investigations on the formation mechanisms of these phytochemical-derived metal oxide nanostructures are necessary to promote their large-scale production and commercialization. The utilization of advanced spectroscopic and NMR techniques for accurate characterization of the phytochemicals is strongly encouraged to clearly identify their roles during the formation of the metal oxide NPs. In turn, a greater understanding of the role of phytochemicals in the green synthesis of metal oxide nanostructures will enable a much more effective tailoring of their size and morphology. Such shape and size control will be highly advantageous for tailoring the functional applications of these green-synthesized metal oxide nanomaterials.
