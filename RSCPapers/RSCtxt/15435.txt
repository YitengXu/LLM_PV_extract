Furthermore, environmental issues including global warming and climate changes are problems that need to be dealt with immediately. Therefore, biofuels (bio-based fuels), i.e. bio-alcohols (bioethanol and biobutanol) which are produced from natural materials have emerged as promising transportation fuels because of their sustainability and environmental benefits which can reduce the dependency on crude oil reserves. Today, bioethanol is widely used as an option for transportation fuel or additives to gasoline in spark ignition (SI) engine due to its attractive properties of high octane number and reduced exhaust emissions. The next promising and competitive biofuel is biobutanol which has superior properties to be used in SI engine without engine modification. The aim of the present review is to highlight on the feasibility of the bioethanol and biobutanol as alternative transportation fuels in SI engine. The first section of this paper is an overview on bioethanol and biobutanol as gasoline alternatives. In the next section, comparative physicochemical properties of gasoline, bioethanol and biobutanol and their potential sources of production are presented. The effect of bioethanol and biobutanol with gasoline blends on engine performances, combustion analysis, exhaust emissions, engine durability and their effect on lubricating oil are discussed in the next section. The review study acknowledges that the bioethanol and biobutanol are capable of improving engine performances, combustion and also reducing exhaust emissions. However, the addition of alcohols in fuel blends leads to negative impacts on the engine durability and lubricating oil properties.M. N. A.

1. Introduction
The revolution of the industrialization sector and rising living standards are associated with huge energy consumption. Currently, the most significant growth of energy consumption is taking place in China with a rate of 5.5% per year.1 The energies are typically consumed for transportation, manufacturing process, industrial facilities, lighting, etc. Meanwhile, transportation and industrial sectors are the main energy usages in Malaysia with 40.3% and 38.6%, respectively.2 It is estimated that the total world energy consumption will be increased by 33.5% from 2010 to 2030.3 The existing amount of fossil fuel such as petroleum, coal and natural gas, which is the primary source of energy in the world is decreasing and it is assumed to essentially run out in the next 50 years. Fig. 1 shows approximately 80% of total usage is from fossil fuel.
 Fig. 1  Fuels contribution to total world energy consumption.3 
The burning of fossil fuel tends to cause environmental pollution as it releases greenhouse gases (GHGs), primarily CO2 that aggravates global warming. The rise of global temperature caused by global warming could lead to extinction of millions of natural species and also bring harm to the ecosystem. It is shown that the emission of CO2 has increased around 1.6 times in the last three decades.2 Pollutants such as CO2, NOx, CO and SO2 are emitted and they are extremely harmful for humans around the world. Moreover, acid rain, an air pollution has mostly occurred in industrial regions because of lack of control of fuel utilization. Governments are now seeking new policies to empower renewable energy to solve environmental issues. For example, the Kyoto Protocol (KP) 1997 mandates that countries involved in industrial activities must reduce pollutants by at least 5% below 1990 levels.2
The limited sources of non-renewable energy i.e. fossil fuels, which will not be able to sustain the needs for the next generation, leads us to study and discover new sustainable and renewable energy sources such as bio-energy. The bio-energy concept is focused on various renewable energies due to massive exploitation of fossil fuels since their discovery. Bio-energy is a renewable energy that uses natural resources for production of biofuels.4 The potential contribution of bio-energy in the future global energy supply ranges from 100 EJ per year to 400 EJ per year in 2050.5 Malaysia’s National Energy Policy of 1979 targets to have an efficient, safe, clean and environmentally friendly energy supply in the future.6,7 Therefore, biofuel is a promising alternative to reduce the reliance on petroleum. An additional factor is less reliance on unstable geopolitics which indirectly improves national energy security.8,9 This renewable energy source is produced from the natural materials (bio-based) as an alternative compared to conventional petroleum fuels. Therefore, biofuel creates stronger demands on various feedstocks while boosting agricultural economies and producers’ incomes.10 Biofuel production also encourages rural economies to become stronger. This is because agricultural crops and wastes are being used as the feedstock.11 Therefore, the production of biofuel is a very promising potential energy supply to reduce biomass containing waste and reduce its disposal area.3 In addition, biofuel is available in different forms i.e. liquid or gas.12 It consists of bioethanol, biodiesel, biogas, bio-methanol, bio-syngas (CO + H2), bio-oil, etc.4 The production of global biofuel has increased three-fold from 2000 to 2007, from 4.8 billion gallons to 16.0 billion gallons. However, it still accounts for less than 3% of transportation fuel supply.13
The world has proposed the use of bioethanol and biodiesel as additive sources in liquid transportation fuel.14,15 Currently, bioethanol is an alternative fuel for gasoline while biodiesel is an alternative fuel for diesel. They are able to reduce toxic emissions i.e. CO, HC, etc. and reduce smog pollution from the exhaust.8,11,13,16 Nonetheless, conventional gasoline engines need major modifications to perform well with a higher concentration of bioethanol, i.e. pure ethanol (E100) can be used in flex fuel (FFV) engine only.8 Besides that, bioethanol is very difficult to handle and use relative to gasoline due to corrosive behaviour. The other option of liquid fuels that is able to replace conventional gasoline in transportation is biobutanol, which can be produced from the same feedstock as bioethanol, i.e. waste biomass or non-agricultural products. Biobutanol is a very competitive biofuel to be used for IC engines because it has many promising physicochemical properties that enhances engine performance. It is also a good potential fuel towards green energy consumption. Although the biotechnological production of biobutanol is much more complicated compared to bioethanol production, biobutanol has more advantages than bioethanol and gasoline. Nevertheless, the development on biofuel requires a large area to produce a huge amount of crops, and this aggravates serious environmental effects, i.e. soil corrosion, fertilizer run off, deforestation, eutrophication and salinity.8 In addition, biofuel production costs a lot of money and is ineffective to reduce CO2 emission if compared to other options.11
The aim of the present work is to review the literature regarding the feasibility of alcohols–gasoline fuel blends on spark ignition (SI) engine performances, combustion analysis and also exhaust emissions that are related to their physicochemical properties. The biofuels that are considered in the present work are; (i) bio-ethanol (ethanol) and (2) bio-butanol (butanol). These biofuels are proposed as potential biofuels regarding their production rate, availability and capability in engine performances and emissions. Numerous studies on ethanol and butanol addition on engine performances and combustion characteristics are discussed in detail. The analysis on engine performances of SI engine will be focused on engine torque, brake power, brake specific fuel consumption, brake thermal efficiency and also exhaust gas temperature. Meanwhile, the experimental findings on in-cylinder gas pressure and heat release rate of combustion will be further discussed in detail. Then, the analysis is followed by the effect on exhaust emissions i.e. CO2, NOx, HC and CO with addition of alcohol–gasoline fuel blends. The standard way is used by comparing the physicochemical properties between the alcohols fuel blend with the gasoline as a reference to analyse the effect on engine performance, combustion and exhaust emissions. Therefore, the obtained experimental findings can be explained clearly and effectively.
2. Bioethanol and biobutanol as transportation fuels
2.1 Bioethanol
Ethanol as a fuel is not a new concept as Samuel Morely had developed an engine that ran on ethanol in 1826. Besides that, Henry Ford’s Model T ran on ethanol in 1908. However, demands on ethanol declined after World War I and gasoline has dominated the market since the 1920s. In 1974, Solar Energy Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1974 promoted ethanol as a gasoline alternative due to the energy crisis. Ethanol is the most widely used biofuel in transportation due to rising oil price, tremendous risk of climate change, increasing on fuel vehicle demands, security of energy supply. Therefore, governments have authorized new policies to perform researches, develop and deploy more energy sources. In United States, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 shows the most significant steps by mandate the use of ethanol through the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS).17 Besides that, the initiation of National Alcohol Fuel Programme (ProAlcool) in Brazil aims to increase the production of bioethanol in order to substitute the high cost and unsustainable petroleum-based products.14
Generally, ethanol can be divided into two types; bio-based ethanol (bioethanol) and synthetic ethanol. Bioethanol is produced from agricultural food and agricultural wastes i.e. corn, sugar cane, etc. fermenting sugars with yeast while synthetic ethanol is produced via catalytic hydration of ethylene, a petroleum by-product. Bioethanol and synthetic ethanol are the same product as they have the same chemical formulae, C2H5OH. Bioethanol or synthetic ethanol is a colourless liquid, transparent, neutral, volatile, flammable, miscible in both water and non-polar solvents and oxygenated liquid hydrocarbons, which has a pungent odour and sharp burning taste.18,19
The analytical studies towards global ethanol production showed that most ethanol is produced by a fermentation process which contributes 97% while only 3% of ethanol is produced via catalytic hydration of ethylene.20–22 The largest plants of synthetic ethanol in Germany and Scotland can produce about 4.4 million gallons per year. There are several multinational companies which produce synthetic ethanol i.e. Sasol (in Europe and South Africa), SADAF of the Saudi Arabia, Shell of the UK and Netherlands, BP of the UK and also Equistar (United States).20,23 The production of synthetic ethanol is economically less attractive as compared to fermentation in USA due to the high cost of ethylene and abundance of raw materials of agricultural products as the feedstocks. Nevertheless, the production of synthetic ethanol is growing in Middle East countries, especially in Iran.
In the United States, more than 7.3 billion gallons of bioethanol were added to conventional gasoline in 2009 to achieve biofuel requirements.24 Fig. 2 shows the graph of world bioethanol fuel production as it reached 4.5 billion gallons in year 2000, then rose up to 22.7 billion gallons in year 2012.25 Bioethanol production is increasing steadily as nations are now looking to reduce oil imports, improve air quality and boost rural economies. In 2011, there are 31 countries in international level and 29 provinces which mandate the use of gasoline–bioethanol blends.26
 Fig. 2  Graph of world fuel ethanol production, 1975–2012.25 
Bioethanol–gasoline blends are often used in fuel injection engines of light duty vehicles as an alternative to gasoline or are used as fuel additives due to high octane number, faster flame speed, higher HoV and also broader flammability limits. These properties allow higher compression ratios and shorten combustion time, which give more advantages compared to pure gasoline.14 The burning of bioethanol in SI engine also reduces the emission of HC, CO, NOx.11,18 10 vol% ethanol in gasoline (E10) is commercialized by the automakers in United States as conventional vehicle fuel and it is widely known as gasohol by the public.24 In addition, higher concentrations of fuel blends, i.e. 85 vol% ethanol in gasoline (E85) has been used for new FFVs. However, the 85 vol% ethanol blend (E85) cannot be used in a normal gasoline engine. FFVs were launched since 2003 in Brazil. As recorded, almost 90% of new cars which are sold today in Brazil have a flexible fuel engine and the gasoline sold contains 20–25% anhydrous ethanol and 100% hydrous ethanol (4–4.9% of water).18,27,28 The addition of anhydrous ethanol fuel blend29–31 and hydrous ethanol blends32,33 on engine performances is widely studied by researchers. Meanwhile, the United States has nearly 8 million FFVs which can run 85 vol% ethanol blend (E85) on the road with various ranges of models such as sedans, pick-up trucks and minivans.34 Table 1 below shows the usage of bioethanol–gasoline fuel blends in different countries.

The other alternative and more competitive biofuel for the use in SI engine is butanol. Butanol was discovered by Wirtz in 1852 as a regular constituent of fusel oil.36 Louise Pasteur then clarified the synthesis of biobutanol at laboratory scale after 10 years in 1861.37 The production of industrial acetone–butanol–ethanol (ABE) by fermentation of molasses and cereal grains using Clostridium acetobutylicum was achieved in 1912–1916 by the chemist Chaim Weizmann, University of Manchester UK.38,39 The ABE fermentation continuously declined since 1950s, and butanol was produced via petrochemical process due to the lower price of petrochemicals and higher food demands of sugar and starchy grains.36 Because of the high cost, low-yield and slow fermentations process of butanol, it could not compete on a commercial scale so it is only produced synthetically. However, there are many countries and big oil companies that looked at butanol again during the oil crisis in the 1970s. Further reasons are the rising price of petroleum oil and the increasing amounts of GHGs in the atmosphere.
Butanol (or butyl alcohol) is non-poisonous, less corrosive, less prone to water contamination, easily biodegradable and has higher energy content than ethanol, but it has similar energy content with gasoline.40 Butanol exists with different isomers with respect to location of –OH and carbon chain structure. They all have the similar chemical properties but can be distinguished by their structures as listed in Table 2 shown below. The physical properties of the butanol isomers are different in octane number, boiling point, viscosity, etc., but the main applications are quite similar for certain usages.

Biobutanol becomes an alternative to bioethanol and gasoline as transportation fuels in spark ignition engine due to its advantages in terms of physicochemical properties. Currently, bio-based n-butanol and isobutanol are considered as gasoline components to be blended in higher concentrations without any modification on a conventional gasoline engine.42 However, new automobiles FFVs that use 85 vol% ethanol blend (E85) cost a lot of money and are quite unaffordable for most buyers. By contrast, butanol fuel blends are able to replace conventional gasoline in existing cars without modifying the engine’s specifications. Szulczyk43 explained that butanol can be blended with gasoline in any percentage up to 100 vol% of biobutanol in conventional SI engine. In addition, Ramey44 successfully demonstrated by moving across America in 2005 and South Dakota in 2007 with pure butanol (Bu100) with unmodified SI engine. Besides that, biobutanol is a less corrosive fuel so it can be easily distributed via existing pipelines or distribution stations as compared to bioethanol. The lower amount of HoV and higher flash point of biobutanol compared to bioethanol is likely to indicate safer handling and usage. Moreover, biobutanol has double the amount of carbon of bioethanol and contains 25% more energy. This results on better fuel consumption of biobutanol relative to bioethanol.36 Biobutanol also reduces exhaust emissions i.e. 95% of HC, 0.01% of CO and 37% of NOx, relative to gasoline.44
There are a few attempts to commercialize the biobutanol as an alternative fuel in transportation sectors by Ramey44 with Department of Energy (DOE) from 1998 to 2003. However, it was not clarified as an alternative to gasoline by DOE or National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The International Clostridia Group has strived to acknowledge butanol fermentation for 25 years but this has been ignored by the producers as they are only presently concerned with bioethanol. In Europe, Fuel Quality Directive 2009/30/EC has allowed a maximum of 15 vol% of butanol in gasoline.45
2.2 Potential feedstocks for bioethanol and biobutanol production
Several raw materials from biomass are still being studied to discover various available alternatives for biofuel production. On a fundamental basis, the various sources of the feedstocks can be classified into two main categories; (i) first-generation biofuel and (ii) second-generation biofuel.18,46
The first generation of biofuel feedstock consists of sucrose (i.e. sugar cane, sugar beet, sweet sorghum) and starch rich crops (i.e. corn, milo, wheat, rice, cassava, potatoes, barley). The production of the first-generation biofuel is widely commercialized with approximately 50 billion litres produced annually.47 Today, bioethanol from agricultural food crops i.e. corns are used commercially for the blend component in transportation fuel. However, the feedstock of the first generation appears unsustainable due to the increasing demands of biofuel production, and causes the rising of food prices and shortage of these edible materials.47
As an alternative, the second generation of biofuels is recommended as an efficient fuel production. The second generation of the biofuel feedstock consists of non-food materials such as lignocellulosic biomass. The lignocellulosic materials consist of crop residues, corn stover, grasses, sawdust, woodchips, etc. It includes seaweed, pineapple leaf, banana peel, jatropha waste, oil palm frond, sugar cane bagasse and other major agro-residues. Cheese whey can be fermented to produce biobutanol only and cannot be utilised for bioethanol production.43,48,49 The feedstocks are environmentally friendly and have the potential to give novel biofuels, as this feedstock is non-edible, being obtained from cheap raw materials and abundant plant waste biomass. In addition, the feedstocks can improve the energy balance of ethanol because of the reduced usage of fossil fuel energy to yield bioethanol. The cellulosic ethanol contributes to significant reduction of the life cycle of the GHG emissions i.e. CO2 as these energy crops are nearly carbon neutral.46 For example, switch grass can store more carbon in the soil than the agricultural food feedstocks, thus reducing the total GHGs emissions. The un-harvested roots of the grass creates soil organic carbon as the carbon negative.50 Besides that, United State Department of Energy’s Centre for Transportation Research studied that the cellulosic ethanol offers highest reduction of GHG emissions compared to corns-derived bioethanol as illustrated in Fig. 3.50 However, the cost for cellulosic ethanol production is not very effective due to technical barriers and the challenges that need to be solved before their potential could be realized. The comparison of the petroleum refinery products, and first- and second-generation biofuels production is illustrated in Fig. 4.
 Fig. 3  Reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from cellulosic bioethanol and corns-derived bioethanol blends.50 
 Fig. 4  Comparison of petroleum refinery products, first- and second-generation biofuels production.47 
In addition, Asia is reported as the largest potential producer of biofuel from crop residues and waste crops due to higher biomass availability.51 Table 3 represents the biomass feedstocks and their potential ethanol yields.46,47 United Kingdom (UK) has almost 148000 hectares of sugar beet in year 2005 and produces nearly 1.25 million tonnes of sugar which means that it could yield around 6.5 million tonnes of bioethanol. There are also about 1.9 million hectares of wheat grown which produces almost 15 million tonnes of wheat grain and this could yield 4.3 million tonnes of bioethanol. However, the cost for raw materials is highly volatile, which can highly affect the total production cost. The price of the raw materials varies from different studies with the range of US$21–US$61 per metric ton dry matter.52 Besides that, the raw materials cost contributes 60–75% of the total bioethanol production cost.

Malaysia is one of the biggest producers of palm oil as it has become the most important commodity crop. This situation results in a great amount of waste production. Palm oil has been listed as the second most used oil in the world since 1985 just below soybean oil.6 Bioethanol and biobutanol are potentially produced from palm oil industrial wastes, i.e. palm empty fruit bunches (EFB), oil palm trunks, oil palm fronds and palm oil mill effluent (POME) as raw materials. Although Malaysia is one of the main producers of biodiesel, producers are encouraged to discover and commercialize bioethanol and biobutanol from palm oil waste due to their inexpensive lignocellulosic feedstock and renewable mass sources. In addition, Noomtim and Cheirsilp53 studied the production of biobutanol from EFB that is hydrolysed by Clostridium acetobutylicum. Shukor et al.54 also studied the production of butanol from palm kernel cake (PKC) via ABE fermentation by Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum N1–4 using an empirical model. The PKC contains lignocellulose that is composed of 11.6% of cellulose and 61.5% of hemicellulose, including 3.7% of xylan and 57.8% of mannan.54,55
Other than that, bananas are also one of the potential energy resources for bioethanol as it is the second largest produced fruit, contributing about 16.26% of the world’s total fruit production in 2007.56 In 2001, the total planted area of bananas in Malaysia is around 33704.2 hectares. Tock et al.57 found that the maximum amount of potential power generation by banana biomass feedstock is 949.65 W, which is about 4.6% of Malaysia’s total available capacity, 20789 MW in 2007. Therefore, Malaysia is able to achieve this target if bananas are successfully used as an energy feedstock, as required in Fifth Fuel Policy (Eight Malaysia Plan 2001–2005) with the target of 5% of the total energy consumption. Banana has a huge of waste generated from its peels which otherwise may contribute detrimental effects to the environment. This is because commonly the banana peel is improperly disposed. The waste may produce hazardous gases to the environment such as hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, etc. during decomposition. Thus, bioethanol production from the agriculture waste from banana peel can overcome environmental issues. The banana peel produces higher LHV and can be considered as the best raw material to be utilized for fuel. Amylaceous and lignocellulosic materials which are found in the fruit and the organic residue are feedstocks that can be used to produce ethanol via hydrolysis, fermentation and distillation.58
2.3 Production of bioethanol and biobutanol
Bioethanol is produced via different routes from several raw materials of feedstocks as shown in Table 4. The first-generation feedstocks i.e. sucrose-rich materials and starch-rich materials can be produced from alcoholic fermentation.18,59 The starch rich crops consist of long chain polymers of glucose which need additional processing. The processing is by mixing and grinding with water to break down into simpler glucose before it is fermented by yeast into bioethanol, as shown in eqn (1) and (2). The corns-derived bioethanol production is obtained by dry milling and wet milling processes.47 In the dry mill process, the starch from the corns is fermented into simple sugar before it is distilled into bioethanol. High value chemicals i.e. fragrances, flavouring agents, and food related products are removed during fermentation. Prior to bioethanol production, two economic valuable ethanol co-products are produced including distiller grains which is used for nutritious livestock feed and also carbon dioxide which is sold for industrial needs. There are three selective species of micro-organisms that can be used in fermentation for ethanol production; yeast (Saccharomyces species), bacteria (Zymomonas species) and mold (mycelium).47 An abundance of research has been carried out to discover a supreme micro-organism to produce ethanol from different feedstocks. Practically, about 40–48% of glucose is converted into bioethanol, equivalent to 1000 kg of fermentable sugar producing 583 litre of pure ethanol (sp. gravity at 20 °C = 0.789).47,60

Lignocellulosic biomass consists of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin as its main components. The biochemical production of lignocellulosic bioethanol has four major steps; (i) pre-treatment, (ii) hydrolysis-enzymatic and acid,45 (iii) fermentation and (iv) distillation and evaporation as shown in Fig. 5. The production of lignocellulosic ethanol much more complicated as the pre-treatment process of hemicellulose is needed to increase the hydrolysis yield before it is hydrolysed and fermented into bioethanol. Hamelinck et al.61 reported that the hydrolysis with pre-treatment yields over 90% while the hydrolysis without pre-treatment yield less than 20%. The common method of dilute or concentrated acid hydrolysis is used to convert lignocellulose into fermentable sugars, and then the hydrolysate is fermented into bioethanol.
 Fig. 5  Production process for bioethanol from lignocellulosic biomass.52 
Furthermore, bioethanol can be produced by thermochemical conversion.3 The biomass can be converted into bioethanol via two ways either thermochemically or in a biological process. Presently, the lignocellulosic materials are thermo-chemically gasified and the product of synthesis gas is fermented into bioethanol under specific conditions.14,62
The estimated production cost of bioethanol from lignocellulosic feedstocks is discussed in previous studies52,63–65 and in more advanced techno-economic evaluations.66 The cost for enzymatic hydrolysis process is also a major contributor.52 The researches aim to improve the enzymatic hydrolysis with efficient enzymes and reducing enzyme production cost. In addition, the economical production of lignocellulosic bioethanol shows reliable estimated cost in laboratory scales, and is endorsed in pilot and demonstration plants. Developers such as Iogen Corps and Abengoa Bioenergy are currently operating with the demo-scale plants to yield lignocellulosic bioethanol.52 Table 5 shows the estimated cost of bioethanol production from different feedstocks.

Similar to bioethanol, biobutanol can be produced from the same feedstocks, i.e. sugar crops, starch crops and lignocellulosic biomass. The biological production of biobutanol has been invented decades ago but the process is quite expensive compared to the petrochemical hydration process i.e. oxo-synthesis and aldol concentration. Therefore, almost all butanol is produced from petroleum and is known as petrobutanol. However, due to the depletion of fossil-fuel reserves and environmental issues, the interest on sustainable vehicle fuels, especially from non-edible materials, encourages the technological development in biobutanol fermentation.
Biobutanol can be produced via ABE fermentation. This alcoholic fermentation is called ABE fermentation as acetone, butanol and ethanol are the main products. The total concentration of solvents in ABE fermentation stock is 20 g L−1 with butanol around 13 g L−1 (ratio of butanol, acetone and ethanol is 6:3:1).68–70 Previously, the cereal grains and sugar feedstocks were utilized for industrial scale by the ABE fermentation process. The study of butanol production by Qureshi and Blaschek71 pointed that the butanol can be produced at US$0.34 per kg based on the corn price at US$79.23 per ton with the ABE yield of 0.42 and the assumption of the co-products of CO2 gas will be captured, compressed, and sold. However, the utilization of these food crops into biobutanol was condemned because of possible food shortages. Therefore, the researchers focus on the secondary generation biobutanol due to abundant cheaper raw materials as the feedstocks. The process to produce biobutanol from lignocellulosic feedstocks is illustrated in Fig. 6.72,73
 Fig. 6  Production process for biobutanol from lignocellulosic feedstocks.72,73 
ABE fermentation was the second largest industrial fermentation process after bioethanol by yeast fermentation.70 This is basically because of the economic importance of acetone and butanol as petrochemical solvents. The substrates of the feedstocks can be fermented with different strains such as C. acetobutylicum, C. beijerinckii, C. sacharoperbutyl acetonicum and C. saccharobutylicum which are being used to utilize cellulolytic activities.72 ABE fermentation of biobutanol production can be done via different modes i.e. batch fermentation, fed-batch fermentation and continuous fermentation processes; free cell continuous fermentation, immobilized cells continuous fermentation and cells recycling and bleeding. Table 6 shows the comparison of the biomass feedstocks via different fermentation processes and their potential butanol yield/productivity. The challenges such as lower butanol titer and product inhibition are being resolved with strain improvement by mutation and genetic engineering. Other than that, it can be resolved with improvement of metabolic activities of the organism in acid producing and solvent producing pathways and also effective continuous fermentation process with promising recovery techniques i.e. gas stripping, distillation, liquid–liquid extraction, etc.40,70 Presently, a number of developers i.e. Butamax Advanced Biofuels LLC, Swiss Butalco GmbH, American Gevo Inc., ButylFuel LLC and Advanced Biofuels LLC are developing their own fermentation process towards an economical synthesis of biobutanol.45

3.1 Oxygen content
Oxygenated fuel i.e. alcohol fuel has higher oxygen content i.e. biobutanol has 21.59% oxygen and bioethanol has 34.73% oxygen, which promote higher complete combustion and lower exhaust emissions.40,43
3.2 Octane number
Bioethanol has higher octane number compared to biobutanol and gasoline.43 High-octane fuel prevents premature ignition that causes knocking which can damage the engine. The higher octane rating gives bioethanol advantages in improving the thermal efficiency. However, it emits 2–4 times higher level of acetaldehyde than gasoline, and hence is highly corrosive.16
3.3 Reid vapour pressure
Alcohol fuels, i.e. bioethanol and biobutanol have lower RVP as compared to gasoline, thus they bring problems when starting a cold engine especially during cold weather.8,10,32 However, bioethanol is easier to evaporate relative to biobutanol. It means that it emits more volatile organic compound into the atmosphere as pollution especially during hot summer days. This volatile organic compound along with NOx gases is converted by ultraviolet radiation into ground ozone pollution.43 Thus, lower vapour pressure of biofuel brings both benefits and disadvantages to the performance.
3.4 Lower heating value
Carbon, C and hydrogen, H are liable to raise the heating value when the oxygen is declining during combustion. The energy content of biobutanol is approximately 82% of gasoline energy, while bioethanol has 65% of gasoline energy. Therefore, these biofuels have higher fuel consumption as compared to gasoline.
3.5 Density
The density of bioethanol and biobutanol are 794 kg m−3 and 809 kg m−3, respectively, which are higher than gasoline, which results in enhancing the volumetric fuel economy.
3.6 Boiling point
As the carbon chain length increases, the boiling point of alcohols increases. The boiling point of biobutanol and bioethanol are 117.7 and 78.3 °C, respectively. The boiling point of each alcohol influences their evaporative behaviour.
3.7 Heat of vaporization
HoV of bioethanol and biobutanol are quite higher than for gasoline, thus reducing the air–fuel mixture temperature during the intake stroke. Higher HoV improves knock resistance and achieves better volumetric efficiency of the engine. However, higher HoV of bioethanol and biobutanol leads to problems with engine start-up including when a running cold engine especially during cold weather due to the cooling effect of the air–fuel mixture at ambient temperature.40,89 Besides that, higher latent HoV promotes higher emissions of organic gases.90
3.8 Viscosity
Viscosity of biobutanol and bioethanol is higher than gasoline. These properties may adversely effect the fuel injection system due to higher flow resistance at lower temperature.40
4. Effect of bio-based alcohols–gasoline fuel blends on SI engine
4.1 Engine performance
The performance of an engine can be defined as the maximum power or the maximum torque available at each speed within the engine operating ranges.91 Many studies have been carried out on SI engines vehicles using various alcohols–gasoline fuel blends to determine engine performances i.e. torque, brake power, brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and exhaust gas temperature (EGT). In this review, the effects of addition of ethanol and butanol in fuel blends on the SI engine performances are the main focus and will be discussed in detail.
4.1.1 Torque and brake power. By definition, torque, T is a turning force produced by the pressure from crankshaft of the piston. It depends on the length of the engine stroke, charge condition and average effective cylinder pressure.92 Meanwhile for brake power, BP is the power output produced by the engine without the power loss caused by the gear, transmission, friction, etc. This power output is called as brake power because the brake is used to slow down the shaft inside the dynamometer. The brake power can be expressed as in eqn (3); 
Brake power, BP (kW) = 2πNT
(3)where N = engine speed (rpm), T = torque (N m−1).A large amount of literature acknowledges that the addition of ethanol in gasoline fuel blend increases the torque as compared with pure gasoline in SI engine. The oxygenated fuel such as ethanol in gasoline fuel blend produces a leaning mixture to increase the air–fuel equivalence ratio (λ) so that it promotes a better combustion and consequently produces a higher torque output.31,93–96 This was revealed by the fundamental studies done by Hsieh et al.,93 who determined the torque output yield by SI engine at 1000–4000 rpm of engine speed and full throttle condition is caused by leaning mixture created by ethanol in gasoline fuel blends. As is evident, 5 vol% up to 30 vol% ethanol in gasoline (E5–E30) gives higher torque output especially at higher speed of 4000 rpm and lower throttle valve opening at 20%. A typical result was reported by Wu et al.,96 found that the lambda, λ could be reached under leaner condition as ethanol content is increased without changing the throttle opening and injection strategy. In support to this finding, the higher ethanol content gasoline fuel blend, i.e. 30 vol% of ethanol in gasoline (E30) gives highest torque at 4000 rpm of engine speed and 0.95 of λ. The same results were achieved by Masum et al.,94 who investigated the torque performance of different volume denatured anhydrous ethanol (DAE)–gasoline blends; 10, 20, 30 and 50% by volume with gasoline. The higher oxygen content of DAE blend gives better complete combustion, thereby giving higher engine torque. Furthermore, the addition of ethanol promotes high brake power, caused by the faster flame speed. The brake power slightly increases by addition of DAE in gasoline fuel blends especially at high speed. However, it was observed that there is no significant change in brake power for the low engine speed with respective fuel changes.
The ethanol content in gasoline fuel blend increases the torque due to high latent heat of vaporization (HoV) of ethanol.31,92,94,97 This provides lower temperature intake manifold and volumetric efficiency. As the HoV of ethanol is high, the charge temperature is lowered as the ethanol evaporates. A comprehensive study was done by Saridemir,98 who discovered the torque and brake power increase as the ethanol content increases because ethanol has three times the evaporation rate of gasoline and better combustion performance.
In addition, the higher octane number of ethanol leads to higher torque of the engine as revealed by Masum et al.92 The experiment showed that the engine torque produced by 15 vol% ethanol in gasoline (E15) is the highest among the all blends of maximum octane number (MaxR), maximum petroleum displacement (MaxD), maximum heating value (MaxH), though the ethanol has lowest LHV. The enhanced octane number of 15 vol% ethanol blend (E15) improves the torque performance. Higher octane number leads to ignition delay that decelerates energy release rate and reduces the heat loss from the engine.99
However, there is contradiction on the torque and brake power performances as Yüksel et al.100 observed the reduction of engine torque and power output while using ethanol–gasoline blend at various engine speeds ranging from 1538 to 3845 rpm at different throttle opening position. The torque and power output of the engine decrease due to lower calorific values of ethanol–gasoline blend over pure unleaded gasoline (22.771 MJ kg−1 for ethanol, 44.001 MJ kg−1 for gasoline).84,100
Limited studies were carried out on another potential gasoline alternative which is biobutanol on SI engine.101 The researchers concluded that the biobutanol promotes a standard level performance compared with the gasoline in SI engine and diesel in CI engine. This was examined by Xialong et al.102 who found that the torque of 30 vol% butanol in diesel is comparable to regular leaded gasoline at a low speed. However, the torque obviously drops at higher speed. The torque reduction at high speed was attributed to higher volumetric efficiency of biobutanol and much longer combustion delay due to its greater latent HoV. A similar case applies if the biobutanol is used as an alternative fuel to diesel in a single cylinder compression ignition (CI) engine as revealed by Al-Hasan and Al-Momany.103 The brake power reduces with the respective isobutanol–diesel fuel blends because of the higher HoV of isobutanol. The combustion temperature decreases as the air–fuel mixture temperature at the beginning of the combustion stroke is lower.

4.1.2 Brake specific fuel consumption. Brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) is simply a measure for the fuel efficiency of any reciprocating engine which indicates the usage of fuel during operation. In other words, BSFC is the ratio of the rate of fuel consumption to the brake power (g kW−1 h−1). Many manufacturers tried to determine a fixed engine operation with the least fuel consumption while still producing higher power. Obviously, lower amount of BSFC is desirable. The typical best value of brake specific fuel consumption for SI engine is about 75 × 10−6 g J−1 = 270 g kW−1 h−1.91The researchers revealed that the addition of ethanol in gasoline fuel blends gives negative feedback in terms of fuel consumption. The BSFC of the ethanol is increasing due to lower LHV of ethanol as compared to gasoline. As referred to Table 3, the LHV of the ethanol and gasoline are 28.9 and 44.4 MJ kg−1, respectively. The experiments done by Koç et al.31 showed that the BSFC of 50 and 80 vol% ethanol blends (E50 and E80) are much higher than gasoline. The increment of BSFC is mainly caused by the percentage of ethanol in gasoline. The energy content of the ethanol is approximately 35% less than gasoline, thus more fuel is needed to produce the same amount of engine power.104 In addition, Saridemir98 showed the energy content of ethanol is approximately 25% less than gasoline. As the ethanol content in gasoline fuel blend increases, the energy content decreases. Therefore, more fuel is needed to produce the same power output at similar operating conditions. A similar effect of ethanol addition on BSFC has been found by other researchers.87,105–107 Some researchers highlighted the higher density of alcohol may lead to increase in BSFC, but it is not explained in detail.92,94,108 Furthermore, Dhaundiyal109 reported BSFC increases with the increasing of volumetric percentage of ethanol due to bigger volumetric percentage of water and solubility with higher pressure, thereby enhancing the formation of azeotropes.
Interestingly, there is a contradiction revealed by Al-Hasan,29 who found the BSFC of ethanol–gasoline blends were decreasing as the ethanol content increased up to 20 vol% ethanol blend (E20). The significant reduction of BSFC on the addition of ethanol as fuel additive to gasoline was stated to be caused by increased engine brake thermal efficiency behaviour.
The addition of biobutanol in gasoline fuel blends also promotes higher BSFC as compared with pure gasoline. The increase of BSFC from biobutanol fuel blend is caused by its lower calorific value. Biobutanol has greater LHV value than bioethanol but is comparable with gasoline. Varol et al.110 found the BSFC of 10 vol% of butanol, 10 vol% of ethanol and 10 vol% of methanol in gasoline (Bu10, E10 and M10) are higher than gasoline due to their lower energy content. Therefore, it is clearly observed that a greater amount of alcohol–gasoline fuel is required to achieve an equivalent energy relative to gasoline, and more fuel injection is required to maintain the torque. Similar results are reported by Pukalskas et al.111 and Dernotte et al.83 as the BSFC of biobutanol was higher with the increasing of biobutanol content in fuel blends, thereby more fuel is needed. The same case applies if different types of alcohols are used as reported by Masum et al.,108 who concluded that the alcohols with higher carbon numbers, i.e. butanol has greater LHV because LHV increases with carbon number, thus less fuel blends are needed to yield the same engine power.

4.1.3 Brake thermal efficiency. Brake thermal efficiency is a measure of the efficiency or completeness of the engine to produce brake power from the thermal input over the fuel amount supplied. The BTE of the engine is calculated as following, eqn (4).112 
(4)Numerous studies have showed the effects of ethanol addition in spark ignition engine on brake thermal efficiency. The BTE can be improved with the oxygen content of the fuel and heat of vaporisation (HoV).113 In fact, alcohol–gasoline with low carbon number, i.e. methanol and ethanol has greater oxygen content than those blends with high carbon number, i.e. butanol and pentanol. Thus, the BTE value for low carbon number is greater than high carbon number of alcohols. The higher oxygen content of the fuel enhances the complete combustion; therefore the BTE is improved.99 The ethanol–gasoline blend was proven to produce higher BTE than butanol–gasoline blend and pure gasoline as studied by Masum et al.108
Interestingly, Yacoub et al.87 reported that ethanol–gasoline blend gives higher thermal efficiency BTE relative to gasoline but with higher carbon alcohols, i.e. butanol–gasoline blend decreases the thermal efficiency relative to gasoline. Similar trend of BTE has been proven by Ansari et al.,114 who determined the BTE of ethanol fuel blends enhances the thermal efficiency due to better combustion efficiency. The BTE gradually increases at high brake power and decreases at low brake power with low percentages of ethanol. In contrast, Varol et al.110 concluded that the BTE for all alcohol–fuel blends are lower than for pure gasoline. It was recorded that the BTE of 10 vol% of methanol and 10 vol% of ethanol in gasoline (M10 and E10) are 4.5–6.8% lower and 10 vol% of butanol in gasoline (Bu10) is 2.8% lower than pure gasoline. In spite of that, all the fuel blends give the same BTE at lower speeds.
In fact, the fuel continues to vaporize in the compression stroke at high latent heat of vaporisation (HoV). During vaporization, the fuel absorbs the heat from the cylinder and the air–fuel mixture will be compressed easily hence improving BTE. The pressure and temperature decreases at the beginning of combustion as the ethanol content increases. This tends to increase the indicated work, i.e. increase the indicated efficiency. Al-Hasan29 found that the thermal efficiency is improved with increasing of ethanol content in gasoline blends up to 20 vol% ethanol blend (E20) for all engine speeds. The typical finding was reached by Khieralla et al.115 who determined the highest thermal efficiency is achieved by 15 vol% ethanol blend (E15) compared to gasoline.

4.1.4 Exhaust gas temperature (EGT). Exhaust gas temperature (EGT) is a significant indicator of the cylinder temperature. EGT is also used to analyse the exhaust emission. In other words, EGT is a function of combustion temperature. The combustion temperature is also closely related to the heating value of the fuel (LHV). In addition, the formation of oxides of nitrogen, NOx basically depends on combustion temperature.116 Therefore, the effect of alcohol content in fuel blends on EGT is fairly important due to advantageous properties of the alcohols. An alcohol such as ethanol which contains lower LHV yields lower combustion temperature that causes a reduction of EGT. Ansari and Verma114 had clearly observed reduction of EGT with increase of ethanol percentage. The heating value of ethanol is less than that of gasoline thereby reducing the combustion temperature and EGT.Besides that, the reduction of EGT is caused by the oxygen content of alcohol in gasoline fuel blends. An oxygenated alcohol such as ethanol gives more advanced combustion hence reducing the exhaust temperature. Saridemir98 observed the increase of oxygenated ratio in fuel blends, i.e. ethanol that reduced the EGT. Topgül et al.117 proposed that a greater amount of ethanol in fuel blend may reduce the exhaust temperature due to more efficient conversion process of heat to work. As evidence, 60 vol% of ethanol in gasoline (E60) showed lower exhaust temperature than pure gasoline. Moreover, higher latent heat of vaporisation (HoV) of ethanol than gasoline causes the reduction of exhaust temperature. More heat is absorbed by ethanol from the cylinder when it is vaporised. Therefore, the adiabatic flame temperature will decrease.118 The typical result was found by Elfasakhany119 who identified the improvement of EGT as the percentage of ethanol in fuel blend increases due to higher latent heat of vaporization of ethanol than gasoline.
The effect of EGT for addition of butanol in fuel blends shows an insignificant reduction in comparison to gasoline. More temperature drop takes place in the cylinder charge at the intake valve closure since butanol has higher HoV value than gasoline. Thus, it promotes reduction exhaust gas temperature at the end of the combustion. Singh et al.120 reported that high concentration butanol–gasoline blends reduce the exhaust temperature relative to pure gasoline. Interestingly, a contradictory finding was revealed by Varol et al.110 as 10 vol% of butanol in gasoline (Bu10) gives higher EGT due to its high heating value and lower HoV that contributes to the high temperature of combustion. Table 8 summarizes the results of the effects of ethanol and butanol addition into gasoline blends on T, BP, BSFC, BTE and EGT from different researchers.

4.2 Combustion analysis
In a spark ignition (SI) engine, the combination of air and fuel flow past the valve into the combustion chamber and cylinder during intake stroke. Then the air–fuel mixture is compressed during the compression stroke. After that, the combustion is initiated by an electric discharge of the spark plug at the end of compression stroke under normal operating condition. The spark ignited flame moves steadily across the premixed air–fuel mixture until it reaches the combustion chamber walls before it is extinguished through the exhaust. Consequently, the combustion analysis is an important characteristic to be considered. Better combustion characteristics of the fuel will lead to higher torque and power. The characteristics of combustion, i.e. mass fraction burned, heat release rate and combustion duration were calculated from the in-cylinder pressure curve data.
4.2.1 In-cylinder pressure. Combustion analysis is the basic analysis for pressure and volume of the system. The in-cylinder pressure (ICP) versus crank angle is a significant characteristic of combustion analysis of an IC engine. The ICP varies with crank angle based on the results from the cylinder volume changes, combustion, heat transfer to the chamber walls, flow in and out of crevice regions and leakages.91 Numerous studies showed that the addition of ethanol gives variations on maximum in-cylinder pressure. Melo et al.,28 showed that high ratio blends of hydrous ethanol–gasoline promotes maximum ICP due to the higher octane number of ethanol that promotes higher spark timing angle, especially for bigger load and high speed operating conditions. A similar result as reported by Balki et al.113 for two different alcohols; methanol and ethanol added separately into gasoline. Both alcohols have higher octane number and laminar flame speed than gasoline. Therefore, shorter period of time is taken for the combustion. In addition, higher latent heat of vaporisation of the alcohol fuels gives higher volumetric efficiency and BTE, thereby reflecting higher ICP. The combination of advanced combustion and higher laminar flame velocity of 0–100 vol% ethanol fuel blends cause faster combustion and reduce combustion initiation duration and also enhances the ICP (and therefore temperature).121 Moreover, a combination study of simulation and experimental analysis was conducted by Deng et al.122 with butanol–gasoline fuel blends who showed that the addition of oxygenated fuel such as butanol yields faster burning velocity so it gives higher peak of ICP for all engine speeds.
4.2.2 Heat release rate. Heat release rate (HRR) is the rate at which heat is generated during combustion. Heat release rate is calculated from the first law of thermodynamics during a cycle. The effect of alcohol addition in gasoline on HRR was studied by Siwale et al.,123 who determined the increase in heat release rate with further spark timing. Faster burning rate in alcohols–gasoline blends is attributed to higher rate of heat release. The result obtained is similar as reported by Masum et al.92 as the HRR starts to increase earlier for all alcohol–gasoline fuel blends due to the faster flame speed of alcohols, and thereby the duration for the combustion is shortened. The combustion duration is decreasing as the ethanol ratio in the fuel blend increases. This is mainly because of the presence of oxygen within ethanol that contributes to faster flame speed as revealed by Turner et al.121 Alcohols such as ethanol enhance the combustion initiation and stability, thus increases the HRR.The effect of biobutanol addition into gasoline fuel blend on the heat release analysis was reported by Deng et al.124 as an efficient combustion process was achieved at the optimal operating parameters with increasing butanol fuel blend ratio. The oxygen content and leaner fuel–air mixture of biobutanol give more complete combustion and thus improve its combustion efficiency and HRR. Table 9 summarizes the results of the effects of ethanol and butanol addition into gasoline blends on ICP and HRR from different researchers.

4.3 Exhaust emission
Exhaust emission is an undesirable element i.e. flue gas that is emitted and discharged into the air as a result of fuel combustion in the internal combustion engine. Excessive release of the undesirable foreign substances into the air will aggravate the air quality, which can cause acid rain, health problems and also cause damage to the ecosystem. Caiazzo et al.125 observed that road transportation contributes up to 53000 premature deaths per year in the United States due to exhaust emissions. In the United Kingdom, the pollution experts from MIT, Massachusetts have observed almost 5000 premature deaths per year are caused by exhaust emission from vehicles, which is more than twice that from traffic accidents.126
The combustion gases consist of non-toxic gases, i.e. nitrogen (N2), water vapour (H2O) and also carbon dioxide (CO2) that contributes to global warming. Other toxic and very harmful gases such as carbon monoxide (CO) are discharged owing to incomplete combustion; hydrocarbons (HC) arise from unburned fuel, nitrogen oxides, NOx result from high combustion temperatures, and ozone (O3) and also particulate matters (PMs), i.e. soot, also are found. Fig. 7 depicts the proportion data of emissions yield by SI engine.127 The amounts of these emissions also depend on the engine design including operating conditions.
 Fig. 7  Pie chart of exhaust emissions in SI engine.127 
4.3.1 Carbon dioxide emission. In SI engine, the gases produced from the combustion of the fuel and air mixture are called exhaust gases. One of the largest amounts of exhaust gases is carbon dioxide (CO2). With sufficient air, hydrocarbons will burn and generate heat to form CO2 and water. CO2 is a primary greenhouse gas emitted through human activities such as transportation. The CO2 emission from motor vehicles is the main factor of anthropogenic influence that increases the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. The effect of excessive CO2 in the atmosphere is that the earth’s temperature will be continuously rising, leading to climate changes and global warming. As a consequence, several efforts are being carried out by many agencies i.e. EPA and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) of United States in order to produce a new generation of clean motor vehicles to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This is achievable by improving the fuel usage for on-road vehicles and engines. An effective way to reduce CO2 emission is by producing more energy from renewable sources, and in addition, implementing lower carbon content fuel in motor vehicles.Studies on the effect of alcohols towards carbon dioxide have been conducted by many researchers. Research studies showed that the addition of ethanol in gasoline increases the amount of carbon dioxide emission. This is because the ethanol–gasoline fuel blends combust better than pure gasoline and the amount of non-complete combustion products, i.e. CO can be reduced.128 As result, 10 vol% ethanol blend (E10) shows an increase of CO2 of 5–10% because of improved combustion. A similar result was revealed by Yuksel and Yuksel100 who identified the higher ethanol content in gasoline fuel blend, i.e. 60 vol% ethanol blend (E60) produces a greater amount of CO2 emission due to improved combustion. In addition, the emission of CO2 increases due to the increased oxygen content from the alcohols. Farkade and Pathre129 identified the emission of CO2 increased with the addition of methanol, ethanol and butanol in SI engine. This is perhaps because of the alcohol blends with higher oxygen content of 7.5 wt% produces more complete combustion of fuel, thereby increasing the amount of CO2 emission.
Meanwhile, there are also several contradicting studies that revealed the reduction of CO2 emission with the addition of alcohols in gasoline fuel blends. Kumar et al.107 identified the ethanol–gasoline fuel blends reduces CO2 concentration. Based on the study, 10 vol% ethanol blend (E10) can reduce the amount of CO2 by 2.04 and 2.94% at 3000 and 4000 rpm, as compared to pure gasoline. Srinivasan and Saravanan130 showed the addition of 2 vol% of isoheptanol as fuel additive in 60 vol% ethanol in gasoline (E60) reduces up to 7.7% by volume of CO2 at 2800 rpm of engine speed due its complete combustion. Besides that, the addition of butanol in gasoline also reduces the amount of CO2 emission by the engine. A comparison study was done by Singh et al.131 who studied two different alcohols fuel blends, 10 vol% of butanol and 10 vol% of ethanol in gasoline (Bu10 and E10). 10 vol% butanol blend (Bu10) was found to emit lower CO2 than pure gasoline and 10 vol% ethanol blend (E10). The reduction of CO2 is because of the faster flame speed but comparable calorific values of butanol to gasoline.

4.3.2 Nitrogen oxide emission. The oxides of nitrogen, NOx consists of several compounds i.e. nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3), dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) and dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5).18,132 However, only NO and NO2 are prominent while the other oxides are only formed in small quantities.133 NO has no colour, odour or taste while NO2 is a reddish-brown gas with a pungent, toxic, corrosive and irritating odour. NOx is naturally formed and produced by human activities such as burning of fossil fuels. When the combustion of fuel is taking place inside the cylinder, the endothermic reaction of nitrogen and oxygen gases occurs at high temperature to produce NOx. In other words, nitrogen and oxygen gases do not react at ambient temperatures. Additionally, NOx is also an example of a GHG gas, which contributes to ozone depletion in the stratosphere. Nitrogen oxides lead to harmful effects such as acid deposition or acid rain. The mechanism of NOx formation i.e. thermal, fuel, prompt NOx and NO from nitrous oxide, N2O were briefly studied by Masum et al.18Substantial investigations have been carried out on SI engines to study the effect of ethanol and butanol in gasoline fuel blends on NOx emission. Most studies concluded that the addition of ethanol and butanol with gasoline fuel blends reduces the amount of NOx emission. The formation of NOx is closely dependent on combustion temperature, oxygen concentration and also the residence time inside the combustion chamber.97,134–136 The study done by Lin et al.137 showed that the NOx emission decreases as the ethanol content in the blended fuel increases. The reduction of NOx emission is due to the lower combustion temperature since excess oxygen is present in ethanol. Based on the study, a significant reduction with the maximum of 86% of NOx is reduced with addition of 6 vol% of ethanol in gasoline (E6). In addition, Zervas et al.138 observed similar findings as the reduction of NOx emission is caused by addition of oxygenated compounds such as ethanol.
Moreover, the amount of NOx emission decreases due to higher latent HoV of ethanol as compared to pure gasoline. The temperature of ethanol blends decreases at the end of the intake stroke thereby the combustion temperature will also decrease. Lin et al.137 showed that ethanol addition in gasoline fuel blends results in significant reduction of NOx emission. This is because 9 vol% ethanol in gasoline (E9) reduces up to 77% of the mean average values of NOx. The results are typically similar as reported by Liu et al.139 who tested methanol–gasoline blend and Zervas et al.138 who tested different fuel blends of eight hydrocarbons and four oxygenated compounds. Besides that, lower combustion temperature, caused by the higher latent heat and lower heating value of alcohol, reduces the amount of NOx emission. The study towards two different alcohol fuel blends, ethanol and methanol by Canakci et al.135 showed decreasing tendency on NOx emission for 10 vol% of ethanol and 5 vol% of methanol in gasoline (E10 and M5), which give 15.5 and 9% maximum reduction of NOx. Furthermore, the NOx formation is caused by the increase of peak in-cylinder temperature.140 The study of addition of ethanol in single and split injection strategies by Turner et al.121 showed lower amount of NOx emission, attributed to the reduction of flame temperature. The addition of 30 and 85 vol% of ethanol in gasoline (E30 and E85) causes lower flame temperature which leads to lower exhaust temperature and thereby produces a lower amount of NOx emission.
Nonetheless, there are some inconsistencies when the amount of NOx emission is seen to increase with the addition of alcohols in gasoline fuel blends. A contradictory result was revealed by Schifter et al.141 as a small increase of NOx emission is produced by the addition of more oxygenated compounds with the usage of 9 vol% of ethanol in gasoline (E9). Zervas and Tazerout142 identified an increase of NOx emission is also caused by higher percentage of volumetric efficiency. The rise in volumetric efficiency causes lean operation that leads to more complete combustion or near stoichiometric. This case results from an increase of flame temperature, cylinder pressure and temperature.30
Besides that, a significant increased amount of NOx emission is revealed by Turner et al.121 with the usage of high ethanol content as pure ethanol (E100) produces higher NOx that is attributed by higher in-cylinder pressure and temperature due to advanced combustion. Singh et al.131 indicated that the formation of NOx is caused by the reaction between the nitrogen and oxygen under high pressure and temperature in the cylinder engine. Based on the study, 10 vol% of ethanol in gasoline (E10) shows an increase of NOx formation because the ethanol leads to faster flame speed that gives quick combustion, thereby increasing the temperature of the chamber. However, 10 vol% of butanol in gasoline (Bu10) shows lower NOx emission level compared to gasoline and it is slightly inferior to ethanol fuel blend due to comparable properties of butanol and gasoline in terms of density, laminar flame speed and also the flame temperature. A typical study was done by Gautam et al.88 who observed the addition of different alcohols, methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol and pentanol gives higher NOx emissions with 12–16% increase compared to gasoline. This is explained by higher in-cylinder temperature upon alcohol addition.

4.3.3 Hydrocarbon emission. Hydrocarbons result from unburned mixture of the fuel molecules in the engine due to improper mixing and incomplete combustion. The formation of unburned HC leads to photochemical smog and ozone pollution.143 There are approximately over 200 organic compounds that have been discovered in exhaust gas of SI engine. The typical HC composition in SI engine consists of paraffins, olefins and aromatics.91 The unburned hydrocarbon emissions (HC) from the SI engine is widely cited by Lavoie and Blumberg144 since 1980. The production of HC emission from the SI engine is quite different with the CI engine. The HC emission is produced at the surface of sprays by the fuel over-leaned and also at the nozzle sac via fuel effusing.145 There are four mechanisms of HC formation in SI engine which have been studied.(1) The existence of propagating flame quenching layer at cold wall surfaces inside the combustion chamber.145–151
(2) The unburned mixture of air–fuel trapped in the piston top land and ring crevices.144,145,150,152,153
(3) Cyclic absorption or desorption processes of unburned fuel by lubricating cylinder oil films and deposits.144,145,148,154–156
(4) Misfire and incomplete combustion of air/fuel mixture during engine cycles result in increase of HC emission formation.150
Rigorous studies have been carried out by researchers to observe the effects of additional ethanol and butanol in gasoline fuel blends on HC emission. The progress study done by the researchers showed the significant reduction on HC emission with the addition of alcohols in fuel blends. The reduction of HC emission is caused by oxygen content in alcohol and leaning effect that enhances the combustion efficiency.31 A massive reduction of HC emission with the addition of ethanol is revealed by Singh et al.131 as higher oxygen content of 10 vol% ethanol in gasoline (E10) gives lower amount of HC emission compared to 10 vol% butanol in gasoline (Bu10) and gasoline. A similar study was conducted with higher ethanol content in gasoline fuel blends, where 60 vol% ethanol in gasoline (E60) emits higher reduction of HC emission level up to 16.45% 157 at 5000 rpm and 31.45% at 2000 rpm.117 Faster flame speed of alcohol compared to gasoline coincidentally affects lower emissions of HC.158 Therefore, it helps to improve complete combustion of alcohol fuel blends and thereby reduces the NOx emission level.
In addition, the amount of HC emission slightly decreases with higher engine load. A study by Yasar159 found that higher alcohol content in fuel blends, i.e. 50 vol% of methanol and 50 vol% butanol in gasoline (M50 and Bu50) reduce the amount of HC emission at higher load of 2400 W compared to low engine load of 500 W. This result is much more consistent than that of Taylor et al.160 Other than that, HC emission is reduced at higher engine speeds compared to slower ones. The study done by Masum et al.97 revealed that the addition of alcohols slightly reduces the HC emission level especially at high engine speed of 6000 rpm compared to a low speed of 1000 rpm. This is due to that the air–fuel mixture that homogenises at high engine speed tends to raise the in-cylinder temperature and enhances combustion efficiency.
Meanwhile, a small increase of HC emission has been reported by some researchers with the addition of ethanol. The formation of HC is affected by the large amount of cyclic variability that causes non-complete combustion which leads to increase of the HC emission. Ceviz and Yuksel161 found that the addition of ethanol with greater than 10 vol% in gasoline increases the formation of HC emission level. Also, the addition of 15 vol% and 20 vol% ethanol in gasoline (E15 and E20) induces a greater level of NOx emission because of higher temperature at the intake manifold and low volumetric efficiency.

4.3.4 Carbon monoxide emission. Carbon monoxide is a toxic, odourless, tasteless and colourless gas. This pollutant is also formed during the burning of hydrocarbon fuels i.e. natural gas, petrol and diesel. Carbon monoxide, CO emission is one of the products from incomplete combustion of hydrocarbon fuels and also because of lack of air–fuel management.91,162,163 Combustion is incomplete if there is insufficient amount of air in the air–fuel mixture. Another reason is because of time delay of the combustion cycle.164The production of CO emission is affected by the presence of oxygen in fuel blends to be run in the SI engine. Enhancing the leaning effect leads to low CO emission level.135,165,166 Oxygenated fuel blends i.e. ethanol–gasoline reduces CO emission. He et al.167 found that 10 and 30 vol% of ethanol in gasoline (E10 and E30) drastically lower the CO emission level. The presence of oxygen in ethanol effectively improves the combustion in rich mixtures. Besides that, Yasar159 identified that methanol and butanol, that contain an oxygen ratio of 21.62 and 50 wt%, respectively, promote better complete combustion and thereby lower the CO emission level. In addition, Feng et al.166 observed the CO emission is reduced with the addition of butanol i.e. 30 and 35 vol% of butanol in gasoline (Bu30 and Bu35) emit lower CO emission compared to gasoline, due to the oxygen content of butanol. Similar outcomes were reported by Rice et al.168 and Gu et al.169 as the CO emission is reduced with the addition of alcohol in gasoline. Besides that, the reduction of CO emission level is also caused by faster flame speed of ethanol that helps to contribute to complete combustion.170,171 The higher LHV of the alcohol fuel blends accelerates the combustion that will lead to low CO emission. It is revealed by Masum et al.97 that the MaxH (maximum heating value optimum fuel blend) reduces up to 12.4% CO emission compared to gasoline. Table 10 summarizes the results of the effects of ethanol and butanol addition into gasoline blends on exhaust emissions of CO2, NOx, HC, CO from different researchers.

4.3.5 Unregulated emissions. The unregulated emissions of aldehydes (HCO) i.e. formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, butyraldehyde, acrolein, propionaldehyde, methacrolein and benzaldehyde are released by alcohols and are commonly formed in the exhaust gases from vehicles. Such aldehyde emissions are harmful to human health.172 The study on the unregulated emissions showed that the formaldehyde and acetaldehyde emissions are richer in oxygen containing fuels than the gasoline.45 The oxygenated fuel of ethanol fuel blend E85 shows highest emissions of acetaldehyde (98 mg km−1) and the formaldehyde emissions of 7 mg km−1. A similar result is also seen in other studies as the acetaldehyde emissions increase with increasing ethanol blend level due to oxidation.167,173 The emissions of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acetone from ethanol containing fuel are 5.12 to 13.8 times higher than from neat gasoline.93,174,175 However, the polynuclear aromatics from the burning of gasoline leads to worse environmental issues in spite of the aldehyde emission increase when ethanol is used as the fuel. Given this factor, higher composition of alcohol in the fuel blend gives a better air-quality than gasoline.168In a different study, Wallner et al.176 reported that the formaldehyde and acetaldehyde emissions increased with n-butanol and isobutanol compared to ethanol fuel blends. The amount of formaldehyde emissions is higher for isobutanol fuel blends compared to ethanol fuel blends for most cases as illustrated in Fig. 8.177 The amount of acetaldehyde emissions of both ethanol and isobutanol fuel blends increases as shown in Fig. 9.177
 Fig. 8  Graph of formaldehyde emissions for isobutanol and ethanol fuel blends.177 
 Fig. 9  Graph of acetaldehyde emissions for isobutanol and ethanol fuel blends.177 
Formaldehyde emissions remain in a large amount during both cold start and hot start engine operation due to lack of catalyst to oxidize formaldehyde efficiently. However, the acetaldehyde emissions are reduced during hot-start operation (less than 0.3 mg km−1).45
Butyraldehyde emissions are generated by butanol fuel blends. Experiments done by Aakko-Saksa et al.45 showed that the butyraldehyde emissions released by n-butanol are higher than isobutanol blend fuels (3–5 vs. (0.5–1 mg km−1, respectively). The butyraldehyde emissions are almost zero during hot-start engine operation for all fuel blends.

4.4 Effect on engine durability
Before the alcohol fuels, e.g. ethanol were introduced in existing vehicles, a range of studies were carried out by researchers to investigate the effect of alcohol fuel blends on engine durability. A comprehensive study was done by Coordinating Research Council, Inc. (CRC)178 of United States to investigate the effect of ethanol on engine durability for current, on-road and non-FFVs models in response to the US Energy Independence and Security Act, to mandate 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels for the upcoming year 2022. The study concluded that engines operating on 15 and 20 vol% of ethanol in gasoline (E15 and E20) will lead to failure. The presence of ethanol fuel causes three main engine wear mechanisms, i.e. abrasive wear, adhesive wear and corrosion. The reduction of the engine valve seat because of the wear mechanism causes poor sealing and high leakage, leading to loss of compression, cylinder misfires and also catalyst damage.178 In addition, ethanol may degrade the metal, rubber and plastic parts of the fuel system because it is basically corrosive.179 Therefore, anti-corrosion tanks, alcohol-tolerant rubber lines, seals and fuel pump diaphragms and plastic fuel system parts are needed to meet the challenge.
A post-test teardown analysis done by Hilbert180 on internal parts of the Verado engine showed that the 15 vol% ethanol blend (E15) piston and connecting rod have higher amount of oil staining and carbon deposits than the pure gasoline (E0) engine parts as illustrated in Fig. 10 and 11. The visual inspection indicated that the 15 vol% ethanol blend (E15) engine experienced higher operating temperatures than pure gasoline. The wear pattern was observed on the 15 vol% ethanol blend (E15) exhaust cam lobe due to base circle contact as shown in Fig. 12.

 Fig. 12  Exhaust cam lobes base circle details for cylinder 3, E0 cam lobe on Left, E15 cam lobe on Right.180 
However, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) of United States refuted the CRC’s report and they stated that 15 and 20 vol% of ethanol in gasoline (E15 and E20) do not show the evidence of deterioration on engine durability.181 The review on 43 studies with the usage of 15 vol% ethanol blend (E15) by NREL showed that there is no abnormal deterioration in engine condition i.e. metal corrosion or elastomer swell. Besides that, the effect of the ethanol–diesel fuel blends in CI engine on engine durability have been studied and discussed. Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) of United States conducted a road test study on two trucks that use 15 vol% ethanol–diesel blend for over 400000 km and no abnormal deterioration on engine condition was seen.182,183 A similar result was obtained by Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) of United States, in that 15 buses running on 15 vol% ethanol–diesel blend for 434500 km did not encounter any fuel related problems and abnormal maintenance issues.182,183
4.5 Effect on lubricating oil
The lubricating oil is typically used for lubrication of an internal combustion engine. The role of the lubricating oil is to reduce the friction and cool the moving engine parts. The other function of lubricating oil is to prevent corrosion and wear, and also minimize deposit formation. The lubricating oil circulates around the internal part of the engine and its quality decreases with age. The usage of alcohol as an alternative fuel is believed to affect the properties of lubricating oil. Jaroonjitsathian et al.184 investigated a four-stroke motorcycle engine running with 10 vol% ethanol blend (E10) for 100 h high speed cycle or 100 h composite cycle, and observed higher lubrication oil degradation. The effect of ethanol fuels on engine oil physicochemical properties was studied by Cousseau et al.185 as the ethanol fuelled engine give a lower oxidation level and less total acid number (TAN) than gasoline fuelled engine.
The usage of higher ethanol blends, i.e. 85 vol% ethanol blend (E85) as the fuel in SI engine enhances the formation of deposits compared to neat gasoline.186 The deposits are formed due to the higher vaporization of ethanol at high temperature, engine lubricating oil flow, blow-by gases (positive crankcase ventilation) and combustion gases (EGR).187 Deposits such as gums are formed around the inlet valve, the injector tips of port injection engine and also combustion chamber.186 Detergent additive is used to reduce the deposit formation. Besides that, the gum formation with associated rust or other particles inside the storage tanks can be dissolved and loosened by ethanol fuel.186 Therefore, filters are needed to be changed more frequently as higher abundance of particulates plug the filters. In addition, an automatic emission spectroscopy (AES) analysis on lubricating oil showed a significant dissimilarity on the amount of wear particles between ethanol and gasoline fuelled engine.185 The rubbing of moving metal of the engine from the wear surfaces forms some microscopic particles, which circulate in the oil and move against the engine parts, that will lead to wear.
Furthermore, ethanol fuel is also miscible with water, in contrast to neat gasoline.188 Boons et al.189 reported that the usage of high ethanol content, i.e. 85 vol% of ethanol in gasoline (E85) causes higher water level in the lubricating oil rather than the usage of neat gasoline in the engine. The presence of water in the lubricants may degrade the metal bearing fatigue life.190 However, FFV engine fuelled with 85 vol% ethanol blend (E85) does not contribute the formation of valve train rust in lubricating oil.189 Tomanik191 also reported that the engine parts that operate with the 85 vol% ethanol blend (E85) are less lubricated due to low lubricity of ethanol, and water-fuel dilution of lubricating oil during the cold start conditions, leads to bearing corrosion and piston ring spalling.
The usage of ethanol fuel blends in the engine causes tribological problems as the ethanol becomes contaminated with the lubricating oil. The effects on friction and film formation of the engine oil was studied by Costa and Spikes192 as it is related to the respective tribological problem. The viscosity for both based and formulated engine oil decreases with the addition of ethanol, and therefore reduce the elastohydrodynamic film thickness and the friction. The ethanol in base oil reduces the friction with formation of a boundary layer at low speed. Besides that, the ethanol in formulated oil reduces friction at higher speed as the viscosity of the lubricant is decreased. However, at lower speed the ethanol reduces the boundary layer thus increasing the friction.
5. Conclusion
The demands of energy consumption, depletion of fossil fuels energy sources and serious environmental issues are the main common problems under debate. Ethanol is used as a commercial alternative substitute for conventional gasoline due to its impressive properties of higher octane number. A new promising biofuel, biobutanol is also attractive to researchers due to its competitive properties compared to gasoline. The production of biobutanol is almost identical to that of bioethanol as they are from the same feedstocks, however biobutanol production is high cost, low-yield and takes a longer time, which leads to difficulty to compete commercially.
The research and development on bioethanol and biobutanol as gasoline substitutes is a highly active area. The review indicates that bioethanol and biobutanol are able to improve engine performances, combustion and also reduce exhaust emissions. The addition of alcohols blend gives higher T, BP, BSFC, BTE and lower EGT compared to gasoline, especially biobutanol that contains a higher carbon number than bioethanol, and thus improves the fuel properties i.e. RON, LHV, etc. Besides that, the higher flame speed of bioethanol and biobutanol gives higher ICP and HRR than gasoline. Bioethanol and biobutanol fuels are more environmental friendly than gasoline as the alcohol blends show reduced emission of CO and HC, notably bioethanol emits lowest CO amount. However, the alcohol blends emit more CO2 and NOx than gasoline due to higher oxygen concentration. The biobutanol fuels also give higher amount of unregulated emissions as they emit higher formaldehyde emissions than those of bioethanol and gasoline. The study also reviews that the addition of alcohols in the fuel blends leads to negative influences to the engine durability and lubricating oil. Ethanol causes problems to the engine such as corrosion on engine parts and contaminated lubricating oil that contributes engine failure.
By reference to this extensive data, the further study on bioethanol and biobutanol especially from different agricultural wastes on spark ignition engine performance, combustion, exhaust emissions, engine durability and lubricating oil is clearly desirable. Besides that, extensive study on the effect of alcohol fuels on engine durability and lubricating oil are essential, since alcohols are significant as gasoline alternatives due to their outstanding properties.
