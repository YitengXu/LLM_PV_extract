    , Accepted 2nd July 2019First published on 15th July 2019AbstractThe surface properties of BiPO4 exert a significant effect on the photocatalytic performance under ultraviolet irradiation, but they have not been well explored, either experimentally or theoretically. Herein, for the first time, we systematically studied the structures and energetics of four low-index stoichiometric surfaces of monazite BiPO4 using density functional theory. A new scheme is proposed to correct the surface energy and compare this with the average surface energy. Both of the two schemes for the surface energies indicate that the order of the surface energies is (100) < (010) < (011) < (001), which is not completely consistent with their surface dangling bond densities. The main reason is incomplete PO4 tetrahedrons, namely, the existence of dangling P–O bonds in the bare (001) plane. However, only dangling Bi–O bonds are found in the other three low-index surfaces. It is obvious that the dangling bond density of the Bi atoms and the intact PO4 tetrahedrons are two crucial factors in the surface stability. Correspondingly, the differences in the planar-averaged electron density and the work function are presented to describe the charge distribution close to the surface. Furthermore, the equilibrium morphology calculated using the Wulff construction suggests that the (001), (010), (011) and (100) facets account for 15%, 33%, 16% and 36%, respectively. The two low-energy (100) and (010) facets dominate in the Wulff shape and make up almost 69% of the total crystal shape area. This work will provide theoretical guidance for the further design of effective BiPO4-based photocatalysts.
1. Introduction
Semiconductor photocatalysis has been regarded as an attractive field for environmental remediation and alternative clean-energy supplies.1 Recent investigations on crystal facet engineering of semiconductors has demonstrated that the surface structures of photocatalysts play an important role in their photocatalytic activities, because the photocatalytic reaction or photoelectron conversion only takes place when photoinduced electrons and holes are available on the surface.2 It was reported that well-defined m-BiVO4 nanoplates with exposed (001) facets exhibit a significantly enhanced activity in the visible-light photocatalytic degradation of organic contaminants and the photocatalytic oxidation of water for O2 generation.3 It is worth noting that certain facets of a semiconductor prefer reduction, while others favour oxidation. For example, rutile (011) and anatase (001) facets provide the sites for oxidation, while the rutile (110) and anatase (101) facets offer the sites for reduction.4 Therefore, the surface-controlled fabrication of nanocrystals is not only a rational route to study the relationship between the surface structures and the photocatalytic properties, but also a feasible approach for developing highly active photocatalysts.5
BiPO4 has received extensive attention owing to its promising photocatalytic properties in the UV region and it has become a valid substitute for TiO2.6,7 It has been confirmed that only the monoclinic monazite phase (space group: P21/n, nMBIP) shows a high photocatalytic activity in the three crystal phases of BiPO4 owing to the large distortion of the PO4 tetrahedron and the wide band-gap.8–10 Currently, many significant studies have demonstrated surface modifications to increase the range of light absorption and enhance the photocatalytic activity of BiPO4 using BiPO4-based heterojunctions,11–14 surface defects,15–17 and high-energy facet adjustments.18,19 For instance, Zhu et al. fabricated a core/shell structured C3N4/BiPO4 photocatalyst via a facile ultrasonic dispersion method12 and a BiPO4−x nanorod with a surface oxygen vacancy via vacuum deoxidation,17 which resulted in the high separation efficiency of the photoinduced electron–hole pairs. In addition, Zhang et al.18 reported the controllable syntheses of the six branch-monoclinic BiPO4 dendrites using ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, which showed a high photocatalytic activity owing to its exposed high-energy (001) facet. Likewise, it was verified that monoclinic BiPO4 with a dendritic morphology showed an excellent photocatalytic performance, ascribed to the exposed high-energy (001), (012) and (031) facets.19
To gain a particular morphology of BiPO4, the preparation should be performed under specific conditions such as a particular temperature and pH, as well as the addition of an assistant reagent (EDTA).20 It was verified that the nanorods of BiPO4 growing along the [100] direction were synthesized when the pH was kept at 1 and the resulting precursor suspension was maintained at 180 °C for 72 h.7 The high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image showed that the BiPO4 nanorods contained (100) planes perpendicular to the axis while the (011) planes were along the axis, as previously reported.12 In addition, Zheng et al.19 reported that the addition of EDTA contributed to the synthesized dendritic BiPO4 preferentially growing on the (001) planes. Very recently, Van synthesized a monazite phase with a (010) plane by controlling the amount of urea and the hydrothermal temperature using a facile hydrothermal procedure.21 Moreover, the photogenerated h+, and the derivatives of ˙OH, and O2˙− generally serve as active species for the photocatalytic reaction of BiPO4 and these surface active-species play a crucial role in its excellent photocatalytic performance. Commonly, trapping experiments are used to detect the photocatalytic mechanism and further investigate the contribution of different active species to photocatalysis.16,19,22–25
Although there has been a significant amount of research conducted on the photocatalytic activity of BiPO4, the correlation between the surface structures and the photocatalytic performance still remains equivocal. Up until now, only a few studies have concentrated on the surface properties including the surface structures, orientations, atomic arrangements and coordinates, electronic structures, and so forth. Meanwhile, experimental methods such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-DRS) and photoelectrochemical performance demonstrate limitations for accurately analyzing surface information.26 Conversely, theoretical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) present a significant advantage in precisely clarifying the relationship between the crystal facets and the photocatalytic properties.27 Previously, our group systematically investigated the electronic structures and photocatalytic mechanism of several crystal phases of BiPO4 and BiPO4-based heterojunctions using first-principles calculations.28,29 According to the references mentioned above, four low-index (001), (010), (011) and (100) surfaces of monazite BiPO4 are involved in the relationship between the crystal facets and the photocatalytic properties. To address the surface properties of BiPO4, in this work, the surface energies, atomic coordinates and displacements, and the electrostatic potentials of the four low-index stoichiometric surfaces were systemically investigated using DFT. We have provided further detailed analysis on the relationship between the surface structures and their stabilities. Finally, the equilibrium shape of the BiPO4 crystal was drawn using the Wulff construction.
2. Calculation methods
The plane-wave pseudopotential method was used to carry out all of the calculations in the CASTEP code.30 The exchange and correlation energies of the electrons were described using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA),31 and the ultrasoft pseudopotentials were used to model the ion–electron interaction by means of the Vanderbilt form.32 Part of valence-electron configurations include 4f145d106s26p3 for Bi, 3s23p3 for P, and 2s22p4 for O, respectively. The cut off energy was 500 eV and the Monkhorst–Pack grid33 was 8 × 6 × 8. In the geometric optimization, the maximum displacement and stress were set to 5 × 10−4 Å and 0.02 GPa, respectively. Meanwhile, the maximum force between atoms is less than 0.01 eV. The single point energy was calculated after optimizing the geometric structure and the self-consistent convergence criterion was set to be 1 × 10−6 eV per atom.
To characterize the stability of the surface structure, the average surface energies of the BiPO4 surfaces based on the slab model with top and bottom faces have been calculated using a vacuum layer of 10 Å in this work. It is well known that the average surface energy can be expressed as:34,35 Esurf = (Eslab − NEbulk)/2S(1)
In which Eslab is the total energy of the slab system, and Ebulk is the total energy of the bulk units with the corresponding number of atoms, S is the surface area, and N is the number of BiPO4 units for the surface system. Here, we proposed a new scheme to correct the average surface energies to obtain more precise results using the relationship as follows: Esurf/(rel-top) + Esurf/(fix-bot) = 2Esurf/(fix-1Face)(2) Esurf/(fix-top) + Esurf/(fix-bot) = 2Esurf/(fix-2Face)(3) Esurf/(fix-top) = Esurf/(fix-bot)(4)
In which Esuf/(rel-top) and Esuf/(fix-bot) represent the surface energies for the relaxed top lateral face and the unrelaxed bottom lateral face, respectively, and only the top lateral face is permitted to be optimized in eqn (2). For eqn (3), Esuf/(fix-top) and Esuf/(fix-bot) are the surface energies for the top lateral face and the bottom lateral face, respectively, when both of the two lateral faces are fixed. Here, Esuf/(fix-2Face) is the surface energy when both of the top and bottom faces are fixed, and Esuf/(fix-1Face) is the surface energy when only the bottom face is fixed. Lastly, according to eqn (2), (3), and (4), the corrected surface energy for the relaxed top lateral face can be expressed as: Esurf/(rel-top) = 2Esurf/(fix-1Face) − Esurf/(fix-2Face)(5)
The algorithmic method is described in detail (see eqn. (S1)–(S4) in the ESI†). The corresponding atomic displacement after relaxation is described as , in which (x1, y1, z1) is the atomic coordinate before optimization, and (x2, y2, z2) is the optimized atomic coordinate.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Bulk structure and creating low-energy surfaces
Before exploring the geometric structure of the BiPO4 surface, we first analyzed the bulk structure of BiPO4. Previously, significant attention has been paid to monazite BiPO4, not only owing to its high photocatalytic activity in the three crystal phases but also owing to its simplicity of manufacture and the easy doping of rare-earth ions.36–38 The bulk structure of monazite BiPO4 has a space group of P21/n, as shown in Fig. 1. Experimentally, it can gradually transform into the high temperature monoclinic phase when it is heated above 600 °C.39,40 Table S1 in the ESI† shows that the optimized lattice parameters of the monazite BiPO4 are a = 6.845 Å, b = 7.083 Å, c = 6.487 Å, and β = 104.26, which are well matched with the previously reported experimental results.10,40 All possible coordinates of the P and Bi atoms are presented in Table S2,† including the PO4 tetrahedrons and the BiOn polyhedra. Comparing Tables S3 and S4 in the ESI,† we propose that the PO4 tetrahedrons and BiO6 polyhedra should be more reasonable in the monazite BiPO4.6,8,27 Namely, for the bulk structure of monazite BiPO4, each P atom is coupled to four O atoms while each Bi atom is coupled to six O atoms (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†). Table S3 in the ESI† shows that the length of the P–O bond (∼1.56 Å) is visibly shorter than that of the Bi–O bond (∼2.56 Å), which infers that the binding force of the P and O atoms is relatively tighter than that of the Bi and O atoms in monazite BiPO4.27

Furthermore, Table S5 in the ESI† shows that the atomic arrangements vary with the crystal axis. Visually, the Bi and P atoms are alternately arranged along the z-axis while the P and Bi atoms form two single main chains along both the x-axis and y-axis. In addition, two edges of one BiO6 octahedron share three O atoms with two adjacent PO4 units to form a linear chain of alternate PO4 and BiO6 units, which consequently displays the characteristics of a layered structure for monoclinic monazite BiPO4. Four types of oxygen atoms exist in the PO4 tetrahedron, which are marked using “a” to “d” in Fig. 1c. Likewise, the subscripts “A” to “F”, shown in in Fig. 1c, indicate the type of O atoms in the BiO6 octahedrons. Their bond lengths and bond angles are listed in Table S3† and indicate that, in the surface structures, these types of O atoms have various characteristics owing to the different coordination environments. Therefore, further details will be provided and analyzed in the following sections.
As for the cross-sectional cases, the four most possible low-index stoichiometric (001), (010), (011) and (100) surfaces of the monazite BiPO4 were selected to investigate the surface orientations, atomic coordinates and displacement, and electronic structures. The termination surface models were built using the traditional approach, that is, to employ a cell that includes a portion of a vacuum, and replicate it in the three directions of space, so an array of slabs is separated by a vacuum. To obtain meaningful results, in this work, all of the BiPO4 surfaces were modelled using three periodic layers for a slab. We took a vacuum layer of 10 Å along the z direction to prevent the periodic interactions between the neighboring slabs, which according to other previous works, is sufficient to make interactions between neighboring slabs negligible.41,42 Depending on where the crystal is sliced along a certain direction, each surface probably has several different termination planes with different exposed atoms (see Table S6 in the ESI†). At the beginning of each surface, several termination models were first optimized and compared to gain the most stable termination configuration, according to the principle of the lowest total energy.41 Then, the most stable termination structure of each surface was demonstrated in detail, which laid the foundations for further investigations.
To create low-energy surfaces, the following principles may be adopted to judge the possible termination surface when cleaving planes: (i) the PO4 tetrahedrons are preserved as far as possible; (ii) the loss of ion coordinates at the surface is minimized where possible.43 In this scheme, the most possible termination models were also optimized at first using the first-principle calculation. Based on the principles, the final cleaving position along the (001), (010), (011) and (100) planes were selected as 0.252, 0.492, 0.957 and 0.500, respectively. The lattice constants of the surface primitive cells are shown in Table 1. The prediction was confirmed by the one-by-one cleaving method (see Table S6 in the ESI†). In particular, except for the (001) surface, the other three surfaces retain all of the PO4 tetrahedrons. It is impossible to keep the PO4 tetrahedrons intact when cleaving the (001) plane owing to the continuously arranged PO4 units along the [001] direction (see Fig. S2 in the ESI†). As the surface atoms dominate the photocatalytic reaction, the two periodic bottom layers of the slab are fixed in the bulk positions and one periodic outermost layer is relaxed by optimizing the geometric structure mentioned above. In this case, the surface energy of the relaxed top lateral face is different from that of the fixed bottom lateral face. Thus, the corrected surface energies are more believable than the average surface energies previously defined for the actual relaxation situation. Table 1 shows the average surface energies and the corrected surface energies for the most stable termination configuration of each surface. It is obvious that the surface relaxation has a significant effect on the surface energy and enhances the stability of the surface structure. Overall, the corrected surface energies are smaller than the corresponding average surface energies.

Here, 0.252, 0.492, 0.957, and 0.500 are the cleaving positions along the (001) (010) (011) and (100) planes, respectively. The average surface energies are calculated for the unrelaxed and relaxed surfaces. The corrected surface energies are only calculated for the relaxed surfaces

3.2 Structures of the BiPO4 surface
To explore the relationship between the surface energy and the surface structure, the relaxed structures of the (001), (010), (011) and (100) surfaces are shown in this section, the atomic displacements, and the changes to the bond lengths and bond angles of the four surface structures are described in Table 2 and are analyzed in detail. Furthermore, the difference in the electron density and the work function are also provided to show the charge distribution close to the surface. In the subsequent work, the two periodic bottom layers of the slab were fixed at the bulk positions and the single periodic outermost layer is relaxed.

3.2.1 (001) surface. 
The (001) surface of monazite BiPO4 has five possible terminations, as shown in Table S6.† The most stable termination configuration with a cleaving position of 0.252 is shown in Fig. 2a and b. The changes in the corresponding structural parameters of the (001) surface are listed in Tables 2 and S7.† Here, the symbols + and − represent the direction of the atoms moving from the bulk-truncated ideal positions. Fig. 2b shows that the most stable termination configuration of the (001) surface exposes one 4-fold coordinated P atom, as well as coordinately unsaturated atoms: one 3-fold coordinated P atom, one 1-fold coordinated O atom, two 2-fold coordinated O atoms, and two 5-fold coordinated Bi atoms. The (001) slab shows stacks of PO4 tetrahedron units along the [001] direction. The pivotal relaxations are in the periodic outermost layer, especially the unsaturated O(2) and P atom. The O(2) atom is displaced outwards along the z-axis direction (0.39 Å) with a total displacement of 0.45 Å while the P atom is displaced inwards along the x-axis direction (0.24 Å) with a total displacement of 0.25 Å.
 Fig. 2  The stoichiometric (001) surface of monazite BiPO4: (a) top view, and (b) side view. (c) The planar-averaged electron density difference Δρ(z) and (d) the electrostatic potential φ(z) as a function of the vertical direction z for the relaxed (001) surface. 
Accordingly, the expansion ratios of the bond length and the bond angle in the outermost layer is clearly shown in the right panel of Table 2 and are represented as RL = (LR − LUR)/LR, and RA = (AR − AUR)/AR, in which the LR and AR are the relaxed bond length and bond angle, while the LUR and LUR are the unrelaxed bond length and bond angle, respectively. The symbols “+” and “−” represent the expansion and shrinkage, respectively. The Bi–O bond presents the maximum shrinkage (−5.33%) compared with the three P–O bonds, among which the P–Ob bond (−4.71%) is exposed to the outermost surface and shows a larger shrinkage than the P–Oa (−2.29%) and P–Oc bonds (−3.76%). Meanwhile, the changes in the bond angles are also obvious after relaxation. The expansion ratio of the ∠Ob–P–Oc angle extends by 9.39% and more than the other bond angles (7.26% and 5.69%), which is attributed to the fact that the Ob atom, with high activity, is unsaturated and exposed to the outermost surface, which greatly affects the change in the bond length and bond angle.
To specifically illustrate the effect of surface relaxation, the planar-averaged electron density difference Δρ(z) of the (001) surface along the z direction before and after relaxation is presented in Fig. 2c, and the definition is described in part six of the ESI.† In the sea-green area, the positive value indicates the accumulation of electrons and the negative value indicates electrons depletion, respectively. The process of electron accumulation and depletion creates a potential difference, which is able to form a local electric field. The phenomenon becomes more pronounced if the atomic layer is close to the surface. The electrostatic potential φ(z) of the (001) surface as a function of the vertical direction z after relaxation is displayed in Fig. 2d. Furthermore, the average electrostatic potentials of the BiPO4 layer and the vacuum layer are −5.09 and 6.44 eV, respectively. Here, the average electrostatic potential of the atomic layer is described as , in which Ei represents the electrostatic potential of BiPO4 at this point, and Ee is the energy of the free electrons on the hydrogen scale (≈4.5 eV). At the BiPO4 layer, the electrostatic potential curve of the two bottom layers is almost similar in amplitude, but that of the top layer is large, which indicates the prominent relaxation of the BiPO4 surface. The work function of the (001) surface is 5.23 eV.


3.2.2 (010) surface. 
The (010) surface of monazite BiPO4 has three possible terminations, as shown in Table S6.† The most stable termination configuration with a cleaving position of 0.492 is shown in Fig. 3a and b. The changes to the corresponding structural parameters before and after relaxation are listed in Tables 2 and S8.†Fig. 3b shows that the most stable termination configuration of the (010) surface fully exposes the 4-fold coordinated P atoms and one 6-fold coordinated Bi atom, as well as the coordinately unsaturated atoms: one 1-fold coordinated O atom, two 2-fold coordinated O atoms, one 3-fold coordinated O atom and one 4-fold coordinated Bi atom. The (010) slab shows stacks of PO4 tetrahedron units along the [010] direction as well. Similarly, significant relaxations occur in the first top layer. Both of the O(1) and Bi atoms are displaced inwards not only along the z-axis direction shortening to 0.19 and 0.21 Å, but also along the x-axis direction with the displacements of 0.32 and 0.32 Å, respectively. In addition, the total displacement of the Bi atom reaches the maximum value (0.39 Å), and that of the O(1) atom (0.37 Å) is almost the same as that of the Bi atom. In addition, the changes in the bond length and bond angle in the first top layer of the (010) surface are presented clearly in the right panel of Table 2. The relaxation of the Bi–O bond in the (010) surface is only −0.38%, which is apparently smaller than that in the (001) surface (−5.33%). The expansion ratio of 3.01% for the P–Ob bond exposed to the outermost surface is larger than the 1.94% of the P–Oc bond. However, the P–Oa bond is reduced to 1.25%. The shrink ratio of 2.55% of the ∠Ob–P–Oc angle is obviously larger than the 0.56% of the ∠Oa–P–Ob angle, while the ∠Oa–P–Oc angle extends by 0.20%. In summary, the changes to the P–O bond length and the bond angle in the (010) surface are not more prominent compared to those in the (001) surface.

To further reveal the influences of surface relaxation, the planar-averaged electron density difference of the (010) surface before and after relaxation is shown in Fig. 3c. Using the same description as for the (001) surface, the process of electron accumulation and depletion creates a potential difference, which is able to form a local electric field. A lot of electrons are concentrated in this region, and there is little electron transference in the bottom layer. The phenomenon becomes more pronounced close to the surface. Furthermore, the electrostatic potential φ(z) of the (010) surface as a function of the vertical direction z after relaxation is presented in Fig. 3d. In addition, the average electrostatic potentials of the BiPO4 layer and the vacuum layer are −4.93 and 6.80 eV, respectively. However, the electrostatic potential curve of the surface layer is very similar to the bottom layers, which means that the relaxation of the (010) surface is quite small. It was found that the work function of the (010) surface was 4.29 eV, which is significantly smaller than that of the (001) surface.


3.2.3 (011) surface. 
The (011) surface of monazite BiPO4 has two possible terminations, as shown in Table S6.† The most stable termination configuration with a cleaving position 0.957 is shown in Fig. 4a and b. The changes in the corresponding structural parameters before and after relaxation are listed in Tables 2 and S9.†Fig. 4b shows that the most stable termination configuration of the (011) surface fully exposes the 4-fold coordinated P atoms, as well as the coordinately unsaturated atoms: two 1-fold coordinated O atoms, two 2-fold coordinated O atoms and two 3-fold coordinated Bi atoms. The PO4 tetrahedrons are complicatedly stacked in the (011) slab. The important relaxations are the first top layer, and the unsaturated O(2) and Bi atoms exert a major effect on the surface structure for the relaxation. Here, the O(2) atom moves with a total displacement of 0.28 Å. In addition, the Bi atom moves 0.21 Å inwards along the z-axis direction and 0.32 Å along the x-axis direction. Therefore the total displacement reaches 0.39 Å. The P atom moves only 0.18 Å along the x-axis direction. In addition, the changes to the bond lengths and bond angles in the outermost layer are displayed in the right panel of Table 2. The bond length of Bi–O shows the maximum shrink ratio (−5.97%) compared with the three P–O bonds. In addition, the ∠Oa–P–Ob angle is obviously shortened with a shrink ratio of 5.03% while the ∠Ob–P–Oc and ∠Oa–P–Oc angles extend by merely 1.30% and 0.42%, respectively.

Here, the planar-averaged electron density difference of the (011) surface before and after relaxation is shown in Fig. 4c. Interestingly, the planar-averaged electron density difference of the (011) surface close to the top face is smaller than those of the (001) and (010) surfaces, which indicates the small effect of the relaxation on the charge distribution. Furthermore, the electrostatic potential φ(z) of the (011) surface as a function of the vertical direction z after relaxation is displayed in Fig. 4d. These results clearly show the stability of the surface structure and the strong restriction of the electrons close to the top face, which is not in favor of a photocatalytic reaction. The electrostatic potential curve is axisymmetric in the middle of the atomic layer. Here, the average electrostatic potentials of the BiPO4 layer and the vacuum layer are −4.48 and 5.78 eV, respectively. The work function of the (011) surface is between 6.47 and 5.69 eV, which is larger than those observed for the (001) and (010) surfaces.


3.2.4 (100) surface. 
The (100) surface of monazite BiPO4 has four possible terminations, as shown in Table S6.† The most stable termination configuration with a cleaving position of 0.5 is shown in Fig. 5a and b. The changes to the corresponding structural parameters before and after surface relaxation are listed in Tables 2 and S10.†Fig. 5b shows that the most stable termination configuration of the (100) surface fully exposes the 4-fold coordinated P atoms and the one 6-fold coordinated Bi atom, as well as the coordinately unsaturated atoms: four 2-fold coordinated O atoms, and one 4-fold coordinated Bi atom. The (100) slab also presents stacks of PO4 tetrahedron units along the [100] direction. Similarly, the important relaxations occur in the first top layer. The Bi atom moves inwards along the z-axis direction with a shrinkage of 0.22 Å and the total displacement of Bi atom is the maximum value (0.30 Å). Also, the O(1) and O(2) atoms have displacements of 0.22 and 0.12 Å, respectively. In addition, the changes to the bond lengths and bond angles in the outermost layer are listed in the right panel of Table 2. The bond length of P–Ob was found to have the maximum expansion ratio (4.97%) compared with the other two P–O bonds (−0.07% and −1.10%) and the Bi–O bond (1.96%). Moreover, the ∠Oa–P–Ob angle has a shrink ratio of 3.12%, which is more than the ∠Ob–P–Oc angle (2.53%). In the meantime, the ∠Oa–P–Oc angle extends slightly (0.53%).

The planar-averaged electron density difference of the (100) surface before and after relaxation is shown in Fig. 5c. The same situation as described above can be found, namely, a significant number of electrons concentrate in the top atomic layer, which creates a potential difference and forms a local electric field. The phenomenon becomes more pronounced as the atomic layer is closer to the surface and gradually disappears at the boundary with the vacuum layer. There is almost no electron transfer at the bottom layer, owing to the fixation of the bottom layer. Furthermore, the electrostatic potential φ(z) of the (100) surface as a function of the vertical direction z after relaxation is shown in Fig. 5d. The electrostatic potential curve of the two bottom layers are almost similar in amplitude, but the top layer is outstandingly large, which indicates that the charge redistribution occurs in the top face after relaxation. The average electrostatic potentials of the BiPO4 layer and vacuum layer are −5.51 and 6.98 eV, respectively. The work function of the (100) surface was found to be 4.39 eV, which is very similar to that of the (010) surface.

3.3 Analysis of the surface properties
It is widely considered that the photocatalytic reaction is mainly carried out on the surface of a photocatalytic semiconductor. The figures and tables in section 3.2 presented information about the most stable termination for each surface in detail. The surface relaxation is able to cause electron redistribution, which contributes to the cleavage surfaces and regaining their stable states. During the relaxation process, most of the atoms in the first top layer in the (001), (011) and (100) surfaces are moving outward, resulting in the atomic layer extending. On the contrary, the atoms in the (010) surface tend to move inward, leading to the compression of the first top layer. The differences in the planar-averaged electron density show that except for the (001) surface, the (011), (010) and (100) surfaces can virtually gather a few electrons at the critical point of the atomic layer and the vacuum layer. It is well known that the work function and the difference in the average electrostatic potential between the surface and the vacuum layer have an influence on the transfer of the photogenerated e−/h+ from BiPO4 to the outside.44 However, the (001) surface was not prominent in the work function and the difference in the average electrostatic potential in the four low-index stoichiometric surfaces of monazite BiPO4. Perhaps, some surface defects in the (001) surface are likely to produce and play a vital role in the photocatalytic reaction. There is not space to cover them in depth here, but we would like to discuss some of them later. Furthermore, the isocratic plots of the total electron densities of BiPO4 in Fig. 6 present the situation for the surface charge. Around the PO43− group close to the top face, there is an apparent gathering of a mass of electrons compared to Bi3+, which prevails to attract the photogenerated holes as well as reject the electrons. Meanwhile, it has been confirmed by our group that the biggest dipole moment exists in the PO4 tetrahedrons of monazite BiPO4, which effectively accelerates the separation of the holes and electrons.28
 Fig. 6  Total electron density of monazite BiPO4 (plotted from 0 (blue) to 4 (red)) with the unit e Å−3 for the (a) (001); (b) (010); (c) (011); and (d) (100) surfaces. 
The 2D lattice parameters, surface energies, surface dangling bond density and other important parameters of these low-index BiPO4 surfaces are summarized in Table 1. Using the DFT calculations, the surface energy of the (100) surface was found to be the lowest while the (001) surface was found to be the highest among them, despite the unrelaxed and relaxed behaviors. Normally, the cleaving process of a surface requires energy to break the bonds, which mainly contributes to the surface energy. In other words, the larger the dangling bond density of the Bi atoms, the more energy is required to cleave the surface. During the surface relaxation, a surface a larger dangling bond density will release more energy as well. Therefore, a low-energy surface usually has fewer broken bonds. However, in addition to the dangling bond density of the Bi atoms, the incomplete PO4 tetrahedrons have an important effect on the surface energy as well. For instance, the (011) surface with the largest dangling bonds density of Bi atoms (0.094/Å2) does not have the biggest surface energy. Conversely, the smallest dangling bonds density of Bi atoms (0.042/Å2) exists in the highest-energy (001) surfaces. In fact, the P–O bond is obviously shorter than the Bi–O bond, and breaking P–O bonds with a strong covalency requires more energy than breaking Bi–O bonds.
As described in section 3.2, the P atoms close to the top face are fully coordinated in the (010), (011) and (100) surfaces, and all of the dangling bonds result from the breaking of Bi–O bonds, whereas in the (001) surface, the P atoms are 3-fold coordinated. To be specific, it was easily found that for the (010), (011) and (100) surfaces, the rule is that the low dangling bond density of the Bi atom possesses the lowest surface energy. We also noticed that for the (100) surface, the lowest surface energy and relatively small atomic relaxation were related to the fully coordinated P atoms and the low dangling density of the Bi–O bonds. It is worth noting that this significant factor if a fully coordinated P atom exists in the surface structure, namely, the P–O bonds plays a significant role in the surface energy owing to the strong cohesive interaction between the P and O. To prove this point, a 3-fold coordinated P atom was premeditatedly cleaved from the (100) surface as an example, the new (100) surface with a cleaving position of 0.459 showed a higher surface energy than that observed for a cleaving position of 0.500 (intact PO4 tetrahedron) (see Fig. S3 and Table S11 in the ESI†).
The surface energy enables us to determine the equilibrium morphology of a crystal. If we know all of the corresponding crystal planes of the photocatalytic semiconductor crystal material, the Wulff construction can be used to visualize the crystal morphology in an equilibrium with its surroundings.45–47 Two schemes of surface energies were taken to form the Wulff construction. According to the average surface energies of the relaxed structures listed in Table 2, the crystal Wulff shape of monazite BiPO4 was found and is displayed in Fig. S4.† The percentage of the entire area of the (001), (010), (011) and (100) facets account for 12%, 31%, 24% and 33% and their surface energies are 1.830, 0.763, 1.310 and 0.709 J m−2, respectively, as shown in Fig. S4a.† Secondly, in terms of the corrected surface energies of the relaxed structures listed in Table 2, the percentage of the entire area of the (001), (010), (011) and (100) facets account for 15%, 33%, 16% and 36% and their surface energies are 1.481, 0.644, 1.018 and 0.596 J m−2, respectively, as shown in Fig. 7. In summary, the two low-energy (100) and (010) surfaces dominate in the Wulff shape and make up almost 69% of the total crystal shape area. The highest-energy (001) facet occupies the smallest proportion. The line charts in Fig. 7d and S4d† show the relationship between the surface energy and the proportion of the crystal shape area. Herein, eqn (6) can be used to describe the correlation: (6)
 Fig. 7  Perspective view (a), bottom view (b), and top view (c) of the equilibrium shape of the BiPO4 crystal in the monoclinic monazite phase, according to the Wulff construction and the corrected surface energies. (d) The relationship between the corrected surface energies and the proportions of the crystal shape area. 
In which Si (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) is the specific surface area, Esurf represents the surface energy and ki is the coefficient for a certain surface (ki ≥ 0). According to the fact that the facet with the lowest surface energy is able to account for the greatest area of the crystal shape,43 it can be speculated that it will make almost no difference to the Wulff shape if other surfaces with very high surface energies appear in the crystal shape. The calculated result is in agreement with the experimental observations for the naturally occurring monoclinic monazite mineral and the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of its nanoparticles.48
4. Conclusions
The structures and energetics of four low-index stoichiometric surfaces of monoclinic monazite BiPO4 have been studied using DFT calculations. Based on the principle of the lowest total energy, the most stable termination configuration of each surface was confirmed in this work. Here, we proposed a new scheme to correct the surface energy and compare it with the average surface energy. Both of the two schemes for the surface energies show that the order of the surface energies is (100) < (010) < (011) < (001); however, this is not completely consistent with their surface dangling bond densities. The main reason for this is the existence of dangling P–O bonds in the bare (001) plane, as there are only dangling Bi–O bonds in the other three low-index surfaces. It is obvious that the surface dangling bond density of the Bi atoms and the intact PO4 tetrahedrons are two crucial factors for the surface stability. Correspondingly, the charge distributions close to the surfaces were presented using the differences in the planar-averaged electron density and work functions. Lastly, the equilibrium morphology found using the Wulff construction suggests that the percentages of the entire areas of the (001), (010), (011) and (100) facets account for 15%, 33%, 16% and 36% under the corrected scheme of the surface energies, respectively. The two low-energy (100) and (010) facets are dominant in the Wulff shape. The high surface energy and the obvious surface relaxation of the BiPO4 (001) surface indicate its high photocatalytic activity, which is in accordance with other experimental results. These findings will help us to further understand the photocatalytic mechanism of BiPO4 and design highly efficient photocatalysts.
