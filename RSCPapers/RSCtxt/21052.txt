    , Accepted 10th August 2020First published on 12th August 2020AbstractThe development of earth-abundant Ni-compound-based electrocatalysts with high performance toward alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is of significance for hydrogen generation. Ni3S2 catalysts have been widely regarded as promising candidates, but suffer from unfavorable hydrogen adsorption characteristics; hydrogen absorption on the Ni sites is not sufficiently strong. Herein, by using ab initio calculations, we have shown that hydrogen adsorption on Ni sites of Ni3S2 catalysts can be tuned by introducing sulfur vacancies. Inspired by this theoretical finding, we have fabricated a porous Ni3S2 nanosheet array catalyst grown on nickel foam that is rich in sulfur vacancies (Vs-Ni3S2/NF) by a plasma-assisted method. The catalyst exhibits a much improved HER activity, which only requires a low overpotential of 88 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 87 mV dec−1 in 1 M KOH. This catalyst also shows high durability, which can sustain 15 h of high-current-density (∼100 mA cm−2) operation with negligible degradation. The theoretical and experimental results reveal that the increase in the electron density of Ni sites induced by sulfur vacancies plays a key role in improving its intrinsic activity. This work opens a new direction for the rational design of highly efficient transition-metal-compound electrocatalysts toward HER and beyond through defect engineering.
Introduction
With the rapid development of clean energy, such as solar energy and wind energy, its conversion or storage as hydrogen energy through electrochemical water splitting has been regarded as a promising approach.1,2 Despite its many advantages such as high purity, abundant raw material (H2O) and zero-carbon emission, H2 generation by alkaline water electrolysis only occupies about 4% amount in the current industrial market, which is far less than that generated by methane reforming and coal gasification (above 90%).3 The key factor impeding the development of alkaline water electrolysis is the high overpotential during the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).4,5 In order to reduce the high energy consumption, the development of highly efficient HER electrocatalysts is inevitable. Currently, Pt-based materials are still considered as the state-of-the-art catalysts during HER, but the high cost and scarcity restrict their large-scale application. Therefore, the need to develop non-precious metal-based HER catalysts with high catalytic activity and excellent durability in alkaline medium is urgent, but still a great challenge.
Over the past few decades, Ni has been widely used in industrial water electrolysis due to its low cost and strong alkali resistance.6–9 However, the HER activity of Ni catalysts remains unsatisfactory because of the strong interaction between the adsorbed H (H*) and the Ni site, which also indicates a highly negative Gibbs free energy of H* (ΔGH*), making the desorption of H* from the Ni sites to form H2 difficult.10,11 In order to further optimize the Ni–H bond, combining metal Ni with non-metal elements with strong electronegativity, such as S, Se, P or Nto form nickel-based chalcogenides,12,13 phosphides14,15 and nitrides16 has been demonstrated as an efficient strategy, which is mainly attributed to the optimized electronic densities of Ni sites influenced by the coordinated S, Se, P or N atoms.4,17 Especially, Ni3S2 has attracted much interest due to its metal conductivity and excellent stability in recent years.18–21 Many studies11,22–24 indicate that the ΔGH* on Ni sites of Ni3S2 is more positive than that on Ni sites of metal nickel, which could effectively weaken the Ni–H bond and make the desorption of H* from Ni sites easier. However, too positive ΔGH* makes the hydrogen adsorption difficult, which is also not beneficial for HER.24–26 Therefore, further optimization of the ΔGH* of Ni3S2 by modulating the electronic structure of Ni sites is necessary but still challenging.
The electron densities of transition-metal atoms in transition-metal compounds are affected by the type and amount of the coordinated atoms.27,28 Hence, both heteroatomic doping and vacancy engineering could effectively tune the electron densities of transition-metal sites, which have been demonstrated by many reported studies.29–32 However, for the former, the introduction of the heteroatom into a nano-sized compound without the generation of any second phase or defect is not easy to achieve, which makes the revelation of the structure–properties relationship difficult.33–35 For the latter, vacancy engineering owns many advantages such as clear composition structure, controllable electronic structure and more exposed active sites.36–39 Recently, the vacancy engineering strategy has been successfully applied in many transition-metal compounds such as cobalt-based oxide,40 nickel oxide,41 nickel-iron oxyhydroxide,42 molybdenum disulfide,43 cobalt sulfide32 and cobalt selenide44 catalysts toward HER. Hence, we believe that the vacancy engineering strategy may be also effective for Ni3S2. To our best knowledge, the vacancy engineering strategy on Ni3S2 catalysts toward alkaline HER has been seldom reported.
In order to validate our assumption, we first used density functional theory (DFT) calculation to assess the change in the electronic structure and ΔGH* on the Ni sites of Ni3S2 with or without S vacancies, and the ΔGH* of Ni3S2 with S vacancies exhibited an optimized value closer to zero eV. Inspired by the theoretical findings, we successfully fabricated a porous Ni3S2 nanosheet array catalyst vertically grown on Ni foam that is rich in S vacancies (Vs-Ni3S2/NF) by an Ar plasma-assisted process. The obtained Vs-Ni3S2/NF catalyst only requires a low overpotential of 88 mV to reach a density current of 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 87 mV dec−1 toward HER in 1 M KOH solution, which is much better than Ni3S2/NF catalysts without S vacancies (158 mV @ 10 mA cm−2, 131 mV dec−1). The advanced structure analyses such as synchrotron-assisted X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) revealed the existence of the S vacancies in Vs-Ni3S2/NF, and tuning the electron density of Ni sites, which is consistent with the DFT result.
Experimental
Materials
Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, NH4F and urea were purchased from Macklin. KOH and ethanol were purchased from Tianjin Chemical Corporation. 2-Mercaptoethanol (99%) was purchased from Sigma. Nafion (5 wt%) and Pt/C (20 wt%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All the aforementioned chemicals were used as received without further treatment. Nickel foam (NF, 95% purity) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Deionized water (DIW, 0.75 μS cm−1) used throughout all the experiments was purified through a Millipore system. The NF needed ultrasonic cleaning by acetone, HCl, ethanol and DIW, sequentially. Then, it was dried at 60 °C under vacuum for 8 h.
Synthesis of Ni(OH)2/NF
Typically, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (2 mmol), NH4F (4 mmol) and urea (10 mmol) were dissolved in DIW (40 mL) under stirring for 30 min to obtain a homogeneous solution. Subsequently, the aforementioned solution and a piece of NF (1 cm × 3 cm) were transferred into an autoclave and heated at 120 °C for 6 h. The Ni(OH)2 nanosheet arrays directly grown on the NF (Ni(OH)2/NF) were taken out and washed several times with DIW, and dried at 60 °C for 8 h under vacuum.
Synthesis of Ni3S2/NF
2-Mercaptoethanol (2.5 mL) was dissolved in ethanol (25 mL) under stirring for 30 min to obtain a uniform solution. Subsequently, the uniform solution and a piece of dried Ni(OH)2/NF were transferred into an autoclave and heated at 150 °C for 5 h. Finally, the Ni3S2/NF was taken out and washed several times with ethanol, and dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 8 h.
Synthesis of Ni3S2/NF with sulfur vacancies (Vs-Ni3S2/NF)
In order to obtain Vs-Ni3S2/NF, Ar plasma (commercial 3 MHz RF source) with power of 30 W, pressure of 80 Pa and gas flow rate of 300 mL min−1 was used to treat the Ni3S2/NF precursor for different irradiation time durations (150, 300, and 600 s). The molar concentration of S vacancies in Vs-Ni3S2/NF is defined as x% = (1 − n(S)/(n(Ni) × 2/3)) × 100%, where n(S) and n(Ni) represent the molar amounts of S and Ni element, respectively.
Characterizations
X-ray diffraction (XRD) results were obtained through Rigaku DMax-γA diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were performed on FEI Quanta-450 FEG. Low-magnification transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were acquired on JEM-2010. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were tested on a Thermo ESCALAB 250XI. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements were processed on Beamline 8-ID at Brookhaven National Laboratory in which National Synchrotron Light Source with Si (111) monochromator and Lytle detector were used. Inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) was carried out on a Varian 710-ES. The EDS, XAS and ICP-AES tests were performed on Vs-Ni3S2 nanosheets peeled off from Ni foam by sonication.
Electrocatalytic measurements
The electrochemical measurements were assessed on a CHI604E electrochemical workstation equipped with a three-electrode cell. Vs-Ni3S2/NF and Ni3S2/NF fixed as 1 cm × 1 cm were used as the working electrodes, and Hg/HgO was used as the reference electrode in N2-saturated 1 M KOH, with a graphite rod as the counter electrode. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) scanning, with cycling potential between −0.6 V and 0.2 V (versus RHE) at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 was performed to activate the working electrode in the first place. Polarization curves were recorded using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) with 90% iR-compensation from −0.6 V to 0.2 V (versus RHE) at a sweep rate of 2 mV s−1. Stability tests were performed by cycling the potential between −0.6 V and 0.2 V (versus RHE) at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 for 3000 cycles first, and the final LSV polarization curves were recorded at 2 mV s−1. The long-term stability was tested under a static overpotential of −100 mV for 15 hours. The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) was calculated by the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl), which was evaluated by CV scanning at different rates from 5 mV s−1 to 300 mV s−1 in the potential range of 0.1–0.2 V (vs. RHE). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed by applying an a.c. voltage with 5 mV amplitude in the frequency range from 10 mHz to 1 MHz at −200 mV (vs. RHE). All potentials were calibrated versus RHE using: E(RHE) = E(Hg/HgO) + 0.0592 × pH + 0.098.
Electrochemical active surface area
The Cdl was converted into electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) using the specific capacitance value of a standard 1 cm−2 flat surface which is normally between 20 and 60 μF cm−2. Therefore, in the following calculation we assume it to be 40 μF cm−2 and use 20 and 60 μF cm−2 for the lower and upper limit, respectively: ECSA = Cdl of catalyst (mF cm−2)/0.04 mF cm−2.30,45 The specific activity of the catalyst is obtained from the current density (j) by ECSA value normalizing: jECSA = j/ECSA.46
Turnover frequency
The turnover frequency (TOF) was calculated using a previously reported calculation method:47,48  where j is the current density, the number of active sites was estimated as the amount of surface sites (including Ni and S atoms).
Theoretical calculations
Self-consistent total energy calculations were performed based on the projected augmented wave49 (PAW) method within the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE), which was implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package50,51 (VASP). Planewave basis sets with a kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV were used and Monkhorst–Pack grids52 were set to be 5 × 5 × 1 for all the energy calculations. All structures were fully relaxed until the maximum force on the atom was less than 0.02 eV Å−1 and the total energy convergence criterion of self-consistent calculation was 10−5 eV. The (100) and (110) surfaces of Ni3S2 with 15 Å vacuum were used to simulate the catalytic interface. The Gibbs free energy change of H adsorption state is defined as follows:ΔGH* = ΔEH + ΔEZPE − TΔSHwhere EH is the calculated adsorption energy of hydrogen, ΔEZPE is the difference corresponding to the zero point energy between the adsorbed state and the gas phase, and ΔSH denotes the entropy change.
Results and discussion
Theoretical analysis
DFT calculation was first utilized to identify the electronic structure and intrinsic HER activity of Ni3S2/NF and Vs-Ni3S2/NF. Based on many previous reports,24,53,54 we took into account the low-index surfaces of (100), (110) and (101) as the simulated models, since these surfaces had low surface energies and might be easily exposed. The calculated formation energies of the surface S vacancies in the three models indicate that the formation energy of S vacancies at (101) surface sites (3.639 eV) is obviously larger than those at (100) surface sites (2.223 eV) and (110) surface sites (2.745 eV), implying that the formation of S vacancies at (101) surfaces is harder than that at (100) and (110) surfaces, so we choose (100) and (110) surfaces as the simulated models. Furthermore, for (100) and (110) models, the formation energies of S vacancy at the inner lattice sites are also obviously larger than that at the surface sites (Table S1†), demonstrating that the S vacancies prefer the surface sites. Hence, only surface S vacancies at (100)-terminated and (110)-terminated are considered here, as shown in the simulated models of Ni3S2 and Vs-Ni3S2 in Fig. S1.† To gain a deeper insight into the effect of S vacancy on the electronic densities of the neighboring Ni atoms, we calculated the differential charge densities of Ni3S2 and Vs-Ni3S2, as illustrated in Fig. 1a and b. Whether on (100) or (110) surface, the localized electron densities of Ni atom around the S vacancies of Vs-Ni3S2 are larger than that of the pristine Ni3S2, which may be attributed to the contribution of the localized electrons left by the removed S atoms.37,55 This result is further supported by the Bader charge analysis, as shown in Fig. S2.† The changed electron densities of the Ni site influence the d-band center (εd) considered as an useful descriptor to evaluate the intrinsic HER activity of the transition-metal-based catalysts.56,57 The more positive the εd becomes, the stronger the bonding between the adsorbate and the active sites will be, which is ascribed to the reduced filling of antibonding orbital states.58,59 As shown in Fig. 1c and d, the εd values of Vs-Ni3S2 for both (100)- and (110)-terminated facets calculated by the projected density of states (DOS) shift positively toward Fermi level compared to those of the pristine Ni3S2, thus strengthening the hydrogen adsorption on the Ni sites.60 According to the calculated εd results, we believe that Vs-Ni3S2 with strong Ni–H bonds should have high HER activity.24

To further discuss the effect of the changed electronic structure of Vs-Ni3S2 on its HER performance, we calculated the ΔGH* of Ni3S2 and Vs-Ni3S2 on different active sites including Ni, S and S vacancies, respectively. For an ideal HER catalyst, the ΔGH* should be zero eV, implying that the bonding between the adsorbate and the active site is neither strong nor weak, which is also so-called the Sabatier principle.61,62 As illustrated in Fig. 1e and f, whether it is the (100) or (110) surface for the pristine Ni3S2, the ΔGH* on the nickel sites are much larger than zero eV, implying a relatively weak bonding between hydrogen atom and nickel sites, and the sulfur sites are better H-adsorbed sites since the ΔGH* on them are closer to zero eV. After the introduction of S vacancies into the Ni3S2, the ΔGH* on the Ni sites for (100) and (110) surfaces are optimized to 0.217 and 0.613 eV, respectively, which are closest to the promising ΔGH* among all possible sites including Ni, S and S-vacancy sites, indicating that the Ni sites turn into the best H-adsorbed sites. The reduced ΔGH* on the Ni sites of (100) and (110) surfaces for Vs-Ni3S2 also means an enhanced Ni–H interaction and an improved intrinsic HER activity, agreeing well with the differential charge density and d-band center analysis. For further discussing the effect of vacancy concentrations on the hydrogen adsorption energies, the ΔGH* of Vs-Ni3S2 with different S vacancy concentrations ranging from 5% to 15% (atomic ratio) were calculated, as shown in Fig. S3.† It can be observed that the ΔGH* decreases with increase in the S vacancy concentrations, implying the strengthened bonding between the active sites and hydrogen atom, and the moderate S vacancy concentration (10%) exhibits the optimal hydrogen adsorption energy. In addition, the dissociation of water is also an important process during alkaline HER.63 As illustrated in Fig. S4,† the energy barriers of water dissociation for Vs-Ni3S2 are smaller than those for Ni3S2, which are also beneficial for accelerating the HER process. In a word, all discussions aforementioned demonstrate that the intrinsic activity of Vs-Ni3S2 catalysts toward HER is better than that of Ni3S2 catalysts.
Microstructure analysis
Inspired by the DFT results, we synthesized a Ni3S2/NF catalyst with S vacancies through Ar plasma etching process. First, Ni3S2 nanosheet arrays grown on Ni foam (Ni3S2/NF) were obtained via the hydrothermal sulfurization of Ni(OH)2/NF nanosheet arrays according to the previous process.21,26 Then, the as-prepared Ni3S2/NF was exposed to an Ar plasma atmosphere for the introduction of S vacancies, and the amount of S vacancies could be controlled by varying the plasma operation time durations (150, 300 and 600 s), as shown in Fig. 2a. The detailed process is illustrated in the experimental section. To identify the phase structure of the products, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed, as shown in Fig. 2b. It can be observed that all the peaks except the three strong peaks belonging to Ni (JCPDS 04-0850) are assigned to the hexagonal heazlewoodite Ni3S2 (JCPDS 44-1418), indicating that the Ar plasma etching has no obvious effect on the phase structure of the materials. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to characterize the morphology structure of the as-obtained samples. As seen in Fig. 3a, b and e, the as-prepared Ni3S2/NF is composed of numerous nanosheets vertically grown on NF with an average thickness of ∼85 nm, and the nanosheet is assembled by small nanoparticles. After Ar-plasma treatment for different time durations, numerous pores in the Vs-Ni3S2/NF products are observed (Fig. 3c, d, f and S5†), leading to a larger Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area (3.44 m2 g−1) than that of the pristine Ni3S2/NF (1.59 m2 g−1) as shown in Fig. S6,† which may be beneficial for increasing the active site numbers. The average size of Vs-Ni3S2/NF nanoparticles is 37.63 nm (Fig. S7†), which is almost equal to that of the pristine Ni3S2/NF (37.92 nm), effectively excluding the influence of the size effect on the HER performance.32 Taking one typical Vs-Ni3S2 nanoplate treated for 300 s (Vs-Ni3S2/NF-300) as an example, the clear lattice fringes with distances of 0.23 and 0.24 nm correspond to (021) and (003) planes of hexagonal Ni3S2, respectively (Fig. 3g). The relative Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) pattern indicates that the HRTEM image is obtained along [100] crystal orientation.12,26 Another HRTEM image of the edge of Vs-Ni3S2/NF nanoplate (Fig. S8†) displays the uneven surface and the appearance of (300) and (110) facets with distances of 0.17 and 0.29 nm, respectively, which is consistent with the simulated models. Moreover, the amount of S vacancies in Vs-Ni3S2/NF treated at different time durations were also characterized by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), which are shown in Fig. S9† and Table S2.† The molar fractions of S vacancies in Vs-Ni3S2/NF treated for 150 s, 300 s and 600 s are 3.93%, 7.18% and 11.63% measured by EDS, respectively, which are close to the values by ICP-AES (4.46%, 8.54% and 12.78%, respectively).

To further demonstrate the existence of S vacancies in the Vs-Ni3S2/NF products, the synchrotron-based X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy tests were performed. Ni K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and Fourier transform (FT) of K3-weighted Ni EXAFS spectra for Vs-Ni3S2 and Ni3S2 nanosheets are illustrated in Fig. S10a† and 4a, respectively. The strong peak located at ∼1.81 Å for Vs-Ni3S2/NF and Ni3S2/NF is assigned to the nearest Ni–S bond in the first coordination shell.64,65 Obviously, the Ni–S bond intensity of Vs-Ni3S2/NF is weaker than that of Ni3S2/NF, implying the reduced S coordination number of the Ni site, which is attributed to the formation of pores and S vacancies.32 The enhanced Ni–Ni bond intensity (∼2.93 Å) also confirms the existence of S vacancies in Vs-Ni3S2/NF. The oscillation curves of Vs-Ni3S2 at the k range of 0–12 Å−1 are similar to that of Ni3S2/NF, suggesting the same phase structure for them (Figure S10b†), but the reduced intensity of Vs-Ni3S2/NF relative to that of Ni3S2/NF is ascribed to the S vacancies.31,66 Moreover, the absorption edge of Ni K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) shown in Fig. 4b clearly indicates that the chemical valence of Ni in Vs-Ni3S2/NF is lower than that in Ni3S2/NF, agreeing well with DFT calculation result (Fig. 1a and b), which also supports the existence of S vacancies in Vs-Ni3S2/NF. To further confirm the XAFS results, we carried out electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), as shown in Fig. 4c. The Vs-Ni3S2/NF sample has an obviously stronger resonance EPR signal with g = 2.003 than Ni3S2/NF, which is corresponding to S vacancies.32,67 The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was also performed (Fig. 4d and S11†). For Ni 2p spectra, compared with the pristine Ni3S2/NF, the Ni 2p3/2 (855.2 eV) and Ni 2p1/2 (873.0 eV) peaks belonging to the Ni–S bond of Vs-Ni3S2/NF shift negatively, demonstrating a lower chemical valence of Ni in Vs-Ni3S2/NF, which is also attributed to the S vacancies and consistent with the DFT calculation and XAFS results.32

Electrocatalytic performance analysis
In order to evaluate the HER performance of the Vs-Ni3S2/NF electrode, electrochemical measurements were carried out in 1 M KOH. For comparison, bare NF, Ni3S2/NF, Vs-Ni3S2/NF and Pt/C (20 wt%) on NF (Pt/C/NF) electrodes were also tested, and the loading amount of the catalysts on NF are shown in Table S3.†Fig. 5a displays the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of the as-prepared electrodes. The Vs-Ni3S2/NF treated for 300 s (Vs-Ni3S2/NF-300) electrode exhibits an excellent alkaline HER activity, only requiring 88, 120 and 218 mV to deliver a current density of 10, 20 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively, which is better than that of NF (274, 336 and 420 mV), Ni3S2/NF (158, 200 and 312 mV), Vs-Ni3S2/NF-150 (131, 170 and 284 mV) and Vs-Ni3S2/NF-600 (110, 144 and 242 mV), as shown in Fig. 5b. Especially, the electrocatalytic activity of the Vs-Ni3S2/NF-300 electrode toward alkaline HER is superior or comparable to that of most of the non-precious transition-metal compound catalysts recently reported (Table S4†). Moreover, Fig. 5c shows that the Tafel slope of the Vs-Ni3S2/NF-300 electrode (87 mV dec−1) is smaller than that of Ni3S2/NF (131 mV dec−1), Vs-Ni3S2/NF-150 (121 mV dec−1) and Vs-Ni3S2/NF-600 (105 mV dec−1), also implying a faster reaction kinetics. Moreover, the turnover frequency (TOF) was also utilized to evaluate the intrinsic activity of the as-prepared electrodes, and the TOF values of the Vs-Ni3S2/NF-300 electrode are significantly larger than those of Ni3S2/NF, Vs-Ni3S2/NF-150 and Vs-Ni3S2/NF-600 (Fig. 5d), indicating its better intrinsic HER activity, which confirms the prediction of the DFT calculation results (Fig. 1).

To further study the reasons for the high HER activity of the Vs-Ni3S2/NF-300 electrodes, we assessed the electrochemically active surface areas (ECSA) of the as-prepared electrodes by measuring the electrochemical double-layer capacitances (Cdl) (Fig. 6a and S12†). The ECSA of Vs-Ni3S2/NF-300 are about 0.99, which is larger than that of Ni3S2/NF (0.46), Vs-Ni3S2/NF-150 (0.68) and Vs-Ni3S2/NF-600 (0.83), suggesting more active sites of Vs-Ni3S2/NF-300 due to the existence of numerous pores and S vacancies. For gaining an insight into the HER kinetics of the electrodes, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also carried out. Fig. 6b displays the Nyquist plots with an equivalent circuit for the electrodes, and the Vs-Ni3S2/NF-300 has the smallest Rct value among all the electrodes (Table S5†), indicating the fastest charge-transfer property between the electrode and electrolyte during HER. Moreover, to exclude the contribution of the increased active site numbers, the LSV curves of the electrodes normalized by ECSA and BET surfaces are also plotted in Fig. 6c and S13.† Interestingly, the specific activities of the Vs-Ni3S2/NF-300 electrode normalized by either ECSA or BET are still superior to that of Ni3S2/NF, Vs-Ni3S2/NF-150 and Vs-Ni3S2/NF-600, implying a better intrinsic activity, which is consistent with the DFT calculation (Fig. S3†) and TOF results (Fig. 5d).

Besides the high catalytic activity, excellent durability is also a key parameter to evaluate an ideal catalyst. Fig. 6d exhibits the LSV curve of Vs-Ni3S2/NF-300 measured after 3000 CV cycles. It can be observed that the overpotential at 100 mA cm−2 only increases by 3 mV, indicating the excellent stability of the Vs-Ni3S2/NF-300 electrode during HER in 1 M KOH. Moreover, the long-term durability of the Vs-Ni3S2/NF-300 electrode was also tested under a large overpotential of −240 mV (vs. RHE) for 15 hours (insert of Fig. 6d). The HER current density of the Vs-Ni3S2/NF-300 electrode only reduced by 4.1%, implying its superior long-term durability. Additionally, the structure stability of Vs-Ni3S2/NF after a 15 h durability test was also discussed by XRD, XPS, EDS, SEM and TEM measurements, as shown in Fig. S14 and S15.† It is obvious that the phase structure, chemical states, stoichiometric ratio and micro-morphology of Vs-Ni3S2/NF after the stability test remain almost unchanged. But the O content in Vs-Ni3S2/NF-300 has slightly increased, possibly ascribed to the chemical adsorption of oxygen-contained species formed during HER in alkaline electrolyte, which is very common in many reported transition-metal nonoxide electrocatalysts.68,69 Furthermore, Fig. S16† reveals that the faradaic efficiency is close to 100% on the Vs-Ni3S2/NF electrode in alkaline media.
Conclusions
In summary, we theoretically predicted that the introduction of S vacancies into Ni3S2 could effectively enhance the intrinsic activity of Ni3S2 catalysts toward alkaline HER, and then the experiments successfully validated this prediction. The as-prepared Ni3S2 nanosheet arrays with optimized S vacancy concentrations exhibited excellent HER performance, only needing a low overpotential of 88 mV and a Tafel slope of 87 mV dec−1 at 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH, which was much better than that of the pristine Ni3S2 nanosheet arrays (158 mV@10 mA cm−2). Moreover, both the theoretical calculation and experimental results confirm that the S vacancies in Ni3S2 increase the electron densities of Ni sites, resulting in optimized hydrogen adsorption energy and accelerated water dissociation. This methodology of optimizing the electron densities of transition-metal sites through combing anion vacancies (sulphur, selenium, phosphorus or nitrogen vacancies) would be a widespread way to improve the HER catalytic activity of transition-metal compounds beyond Ni3S2.
