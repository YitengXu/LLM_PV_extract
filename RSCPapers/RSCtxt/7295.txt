    , Accepted 9th December 2020First published on 10th December 2020AbstractCdS has been regarded as a promising visible-light-response photocatalyst in H2 production while its practical application is often limited by low photoactivity and serious photocorrosion. To tackle these problems, traditional CdS based core–shell and supported photocatalysts have been widely developed but they also suffer from intrinsic structural drawbacks. Herein, a novel stacked nanostructure with CdS embedded at interfaces between graphene supports and metallic MoS2 overlayers has been designed to eliminate the shortages and achieve outstanding photocatalytic performance, which reaches an optimum H2 production rate of 14.4 mmol gcat−1 h−1 and realizes an apparent quantum efficiency of 23.7% at 420 nm without obvious deterioration of activity in 20 h cyclic testing, far exceeding that of pure CdS by a factor of 17.9 times. The enhanced photocatalytic performance is mainly ascribed to the synergistic effects of MoS2 and graphene: (1) the intimate contact between the CdS core and MoS2 shell with a large interfacial area favors the transfer of photogenerated electrons to MoS2 cocatalysts, while a high-percentage 1T-phase provides an excellent electron mobility in the MoS2 cocatalysts and a high density of active sites for H2 evolution; (2) CdS cores are protected by MoS2 and graphene from photocorrosion, in which photogenerated holes are quickly transferred to the MoS2 shell and isolated from the sulfide surface, while excessive electrons in CdS are shuttled to adjacent MoS2 outer layers by graphene supports for H2 evolution in reducing their recombination with holes in the MoS2 shell and increasing the number of MoS2 sites available for the proton reduction reaction. The stacking design can be extended to the fabrication of other highly efficient photocatalytic systems.
1. Introduction
Solar driven photocatalytic water splitting to produce H2 has been regarded as a renewable and sustainable solution to address the increasing environmental and energy crisis.1–5 Since the discovery of photoelectrochemical H2 evolution on TiO2, a large number of semiconductor photocatalysts have been developed for H2 production.6 Among them, CdS has been widely studied owing to its relatively narrow bandgap for visible-light harvesting and suitable flat-band potential for proton reduction.7–9 However, similar to other photocatalytic semiconductors, CdS often suffers from serious electron–hole recombination and sluggish surface reaction kinetics, resulting in low solar-to-chemical energy conversion efficiency.10,11 The loading of appropriate cocatalysts on semiconductor photocatalysts has been demonstrated to be a promising approach to address the above issues.12,13 Cocatalysts not only trap electrons or holes from light-harvesting semiconductors for the suppression of charge recombination, but also provide highly active sites for accelerated catalytic reaction kinetics. So far, various reduction cocatalysts have been developed for H2 evolution.14,15 Especially, numerous efforts have been devoted to the development of earth-abundant cocatalysts with high efficiency and low cost in consideration of the scarcity and high price of noble metals.13
MoS2 has been believed to be a preferable cost-effective H2 evolution cocatalyst for CdS based photocatalysts for the reason that the intimate contact between them is crucial for inter-electron transfer due to the common S2− anions for each other.16–19 Nevertheless, its cocatalytic activity is often restricted by the poor electrical conductivity and inert basal plane. Then a graphene support has been introduced to fabricate a graphene/MoS2 hybrid cocatalyst, in which graphene acts as a conductive channel for the transportation of photo-generated electrons from supported CdS to the reactive sites located along the edges of MoS2 nanosheets.20–25 The main deficiency of this design lies in the long electron transfer distance from CdS to the edge sites of MoS2, inevitably increasing the probability of charge carrier loss. As another effective method, metallic MoS2 cocatalysts containing high percentages of the 1T phase have been used to replace the traditional 2H phase MoS2 (2H-MoS2) owing to their superior charge transport mobilities and additional reaction sites on the basal plane, enabling a higher diffusion rate and shorter migration distance of electrons for enhanced photocatalytic performance.26–30 Nonetheless, considering that 1T phase MoS2 (1T-MoS2) with a distorted crystal structure is a thermodynamically metastable phase, self-assembly of pre-synthesized 1T-MoS2 cocatalysts with semiconductors is often necessary to avoid the further high-temperature synthetic process, inevitably leading to poor interfacial contact between them for charge transfer.31
In addition, the practical applications of CdS based photocatalysts are also hampered by the intrinsic drawback of photocorrosion mainly owing to the accumulation of excess photo-induced holes on the sulfide surface, which oxidize sulfide ions to sulphur and/or sulfate and attenuate the stability of the photocatalyst.32,33 Coating a protection layer over the CdS surface represents an efficient method to isolate the holes from the semiconductor and improve its resistance to photocorrosion.34–37 Nevertheless, in the designed core–shell structures, both the photogenerated electrons and holes are required to transfer from the CdS core to the anti-corrosion shell for redox reactions, inevitably resulting in undesirable charge recombination.
Based on the discussion above, both traditional CdS based core–shell and supported photocatalysts suffer from intrinsic structural drawbacks, in which core–shell structures disfavor the charge separation, while supported ones cannot effectively abate the photocorrosion of exposed CdS. To tackle the above shortcomings, in this work, we demonstrate a novel stacked nanostructure with CdS embedded at interfaces between graphene and MoS2 for improved photocatalytic H2 evolution. In this design, CdS is directly supported by graphene nanosheets and simultaneously covered with few-layered metallic MoS2 nanoflakes. The highly conductive MoS2 cocatalysts not only act as high-efficient electron acceptors from CdS owing to the large area of the intimate contact between them, but also offer abundant reaction sites for H2 production due to the high-percentage of the 1T phase involved. Moreover, CdS is completely encapsulated by MoS2 and graphene which protected it from photocorrosion, in which MoS2 shells accept the photogenerated holes from the CdS core, preventing the oxidation of S2−, while graphene channels deliver the excessive electrons from the CdS core to the MoS2 outer layers for H2 evolution, suppressing the charge recombination in the MoS2 shell and enabling the participation of more MoS2 in the proton reduction reaction.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of rGO–CdS
10.0 mg of graphite oxide was dispersed in 40 mL of water to form a graphene oxide (GO) aqueous suspension via probe sonication (Scientz-IID, China) for 1 h. Then 1.6 mmol of Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O and 40 mmol of thiourea were dissolved in the GO aqueous suspension after stirring for 30 min at room temperature. The solution was then transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and maintained at 140 °C for 2 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the resultant product was separated by centrifugation, washed several times with deionized water and ethanol to remove possible remaining cations and anions, and dried at 45 °C in a vacuum.
2.2 Synthesis of rGO–CdS@MoS2
600.0 mg of the prepared rGO–CdS was re-dispersed in 3.6 mL of water and then added into a solution containing 3.6 mL of water and 5 mL of absolute ethanol, followed by stirring for 1 h. Next, 80.7 mg of Na2MoO4·2H2O was added to the above mixture and stirred to form a suspension. Besides, another solution was prepared by dissolving 21.4 mg of S power in 2.5 mL of 85% N2H4·H2O at 50 °C by stirring, which was then dropwise injected into the first suspension. Finally, the mixture was transferred into a 20 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and kept at 200 °C for 10 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the resultant product was separated by centrifugation, washed several times with deionized water and ethanol to remove possible remaining cations and anions, and dried at 45 °C in a vacuum. In order to investigate the effect of CdS content on the photocatalytic activity, the amounts of graphite oxide were varied from 2.0 to 26.0 mg (2.0, 5.0, 10.0, 17.0 and 26.0) and the corresponding amounts of rGO–CdS were 300.0, 400.0, 600.0, 1200.0 and 3600.0 mg, respectively.
2.3 Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements
5.0 mg of as-prepared samples was uniformly mixed with 15 μL of Nafion and 15 μL of ethanol, which were then uniformly coated onto a 1 cm × 1 cm fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate. Subsequently, the coated ITO glass was dried at 50 °C for 3 h in a vacuum (Fig. S1†). The electrochemical measurements were performed on a CHI 760E electrochemical station (Shanghai Chenhua, China). A standard three electrode system was used consisting of the ITO glass as the photoelectrode, an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode, and Pt foil as the counter electrode, which were inserted in a quartz cell containing 0.5 M Ar-saturated Na2SO4 electrolyte. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was carried out with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in the 10−1 to 105 Hz frequency range with an AC voltage amplitude of 10 mV at an applied potential of 0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Mott–Schottky plots were recorded at a frequency of 1000 Hz with a bias potential that ranged from 1.0 to −1.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The photoelectrochemical tests were performed under ambient conditions under the irradiation of a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300D/300DUV, Beijing Perfectlight, China). The power density of visible light (420 < λ < 780 nm) was measured to be 100 mW cm−2. The photocurrent density vs. time (I–t) curves of the prepared photoelectrodes were recorded at an applied potential of 0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl under chopped light irradiation (light on/off cycles: 60 s) for 600 s. The transient open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements were performed for a total of 800 s, and the light on and off were controlled at 100 and 400 s from the start, respectively.
2.4 Photocatalytic H2 evolution measurements
To investigate the photocatalytic performance of the samples in H2 production, 30 mg of photocatalysts was dispersed in 50 mL of a deionized water/lactic acid mixture (10 vol% lactic acid). The mixture was sonicated to form a uniform suspension in a 100 mL reactor (Beijing Perfectlight, China), followed by purging the reactor with Ar to eliminate air. Then the light-irradiation experiment was performed by using a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300D/300DUV, Beijing Perfectlight, China) with visible light as the illumination source. The power density of visible light (420 < λ < 780 nm) was measured to be 100 mW cm−2 using a radiometer (FZ-A, China). The photocatalytic reaction was conducted for 4 h. During the reaction process, 1 mL of gas was sampled from the glass chamber at given time intervals (1 h). The produced H2 was analyzed by using a gas chromatograph (GC-2014, Shimadzu) through a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) with Ar as the carrier gas. During the stability test, the photocatalyst was collected after each run and then reused for the photocatalytic reaction. The apparent quantum efficiency (QE) was measured under the same photocatalytic reaction conditions except for the use of a 420 nm LED instead of a cutoff filter. The QE was calculated according to the following equation: (1)
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Sample synthesis and characterization
The synthetic process of the stacked nanostructure is illustrated in Fig. 1a. Firstly, in situ growth of CdS on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was performed via a hydrothermal approach with cadmium acetate and exfoliated GO nanosheets as precursors and thiourea as both the sulfur source and reducing agent, respectively. From the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the as-prepared rGO–CdS in Fig. 1b and c, it can be clearly seen that CdS nanospheres with an average diameter of around 100 nm are distributed over the surface of wrinkled rGO nanosheets without obvious aggregation. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image in Fig. 1d shows a good crystalline character of CdS with a lattice spacing of 3.6 Å, corresponding to the assigned (100) plane. The second step is the in situ growth of MoS2 on rGO–CdS through a hydrothermal method with MoO42− ions and S power as precursors and hydrazine hydrate as the reductant, respectively (Fig. 1a). As shown in Fig. 1e and f (also in Fig. S2†), MoS2 nanoflakes are uniformly lying on the surface of both CdS and rGO, which roughen the surface of rGO nanosheets and enwrap the exposed part of CdS nanospheres, forming two-dimensional stacked nanostructures with CdS embedded at the interfaces between rGO supports and MoS2 outer layers. As revealed by the HRTEM image of the as-obtained rGO–CdS@MoS2 (Fig. 1g), the MoS2 shells are in intimate contact with the CdS cores, which are composed of several layers with an interlayer spacing of 6.2 Å. Moreover, the coexistence of 1T (octahedral) and 2H (trigonal-prismatic) phases of MoS2 can be unambiguously observed in the HRTEM image (Fig. S3a†). The 1T and 2H domains are randomly distributed without regular configuration (Fig. S3b†).

The stacked structure with CdS cores encapsulated at the interfaces between rGO and MoS2 nanosheets is further confirmed by the scanning TEM (STEM) image and the elemental distribution of Cd, S, C, O and Mo in the rGO–CdS@MoS2 sample is revealed by the corresponding energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping profiles (Fig. 2a and b). The chemical states of the constituent elements are then investigated by an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study, in which obvious peaks of Cd, S, C, O and Mo can be observed (Fig. S4a†). The high-resolution Cd3d spectrum shows two peaks with binding energies of 405.2 and 412.0 eV, which can be assigned to the Cd3d5/2 and Cd3d3/2 of CdS, respectively (Fig. 2c).38 The S2p spectrum can be deconvoluted into two peaks centred at 161.3 and 162.6 eV, corresponding to the S2p3/2 and S2p1/2 of S2−, respectively (Fig. 2d).39 Besides, an extra peak of oxidized sulfur groups at 168.6 eV can also be observed.40 In the C1s spectrum (Fig. 2e), three peaks located at 284.5, 285.8 and 288.6 eV are attributed to graphitic sp2 carbon, C–O and CO groups of rGO, respectively.41 The weak peaks of the C–O and CO bonds suggest the removal of most of the oxygen-containing function groups. The corresponding O1s binding energies at 531.3 and 532.2 eV can be ascribed to O–C and OC, respectively (Fig. S4b†).42 The doublet peaks in the Mo3d spectrum are ascribed to the binding energy of Mo3d5/2 and Mo3d3/2, including 2H-MoS2 peaks at around 229.2 and 232.4 eV as well as 1T-MoS2 peaks at around 228.1 and 231.3 eV (Fig. 2f).43 According to the areas of the fitted Mo3d5/2 peak located at 229.2 and 228.1 eV, the ratio of 2H to 1T phase is estimated to be 34.2%:65.8%. Furthermore, an additional weak peak appearing at 235.4 eV belongs to the higher oxidation state of Mo6+, probably resulting from the slight oxidation of MoS2. Another peak at a binding energy of 225.5 eV represents the S2s peak of S2−, and its strong intensity in comparison with those of Mo3d ones indicates that the S peaks are mainly originated from CdS rather than MoS2 owing to the high CdS:MoS2 molar ratio.44

In addition to rGO–CdS, three other reference samples were also synthesized for comparison. Bare CdS nanospheres were synthesized though the same experimental methods as rGO–CdS except without the addition of the GO precursor (Fig. 3a–c).45 CdS@MoS2 core–shell nanostructures were prepared under equivalent reaction conditions to rGO–CdS@MoS2 except for the use of as-synthesized CdS instead of rGO–CdS as a precursor (Fig. 3d–f). The third one is the rGO@MoS2–CdS sample, which was obtained by using the same precursors and following the same synthetic methods as rGO–CdS@MoS2 but in the reverse procedure: MoS2 nanoflakes were firstly anchored on rGO nanosheets to form the rGO@MoS2 core–shell nanosheets (Fig. S5†), followed by the growth of CdS nanospheres on the composite nanosheets (Fig. 3g–i). Compared to rGO–CdS@MoS2, CdS nanospheres in all the reference samples exhibit an approximate average size in the TEM images and the same lattice distance in the HRTEM images. The main difference is that the CdS spheres are exposed to ambient conditions in rGO–CdS and rGO@MoS2–CdS, while they are fully enclosed by the MoS2 shells in CdS@MoS2, rather than simultaneously wrapped by the combination of rGO and MoS2 in rGO–CdS@MoS2.
 Fig. 3  Characterization of reference samples in comparison with rGO–CdS@MoS2: (a–i) schematic illustration and TEM and HRTEM images of reference samples: (a–c) CdS, (d–f) CdS@MoS2 and (g–i) rGO@MoS2–CdS; (j–l) spectral characterization of CdS based samples: (j) XRD patterns, (k) Raman spectra and (l) UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra. 
The spectral characterization of the CdS based samples was further performed by the combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. XRD patterns in Fig. 3j demonstrate that all the samples exhibit similar peaks, corresponding to the hexagonal phase of wurtzite CdS (JCPDS no. 65-3414). No obvious peaks of rGO and MoS2 can be observed owing to their low content and poor crystallinity. Fig. 3k shows the different Raman spectra of the samples. Bare CdS exhibits two characteristic peaks at 299.2 and 601.3 cm−1, corresponding to the 1st and 2nd longitudinal optical-phonon (LO) modes.46 With the introduction of rGO, additional peaks at 1351.9 and 1604.1 cm−2 can be indexed to the well-documented D band and G band of rGO.47 The further MoS2 coverage results in the disappearance of the CdS peaks and the decline in the intensities of rGO peaks. A similar phenomenon can also be seen in the Raman spectra of CdS@MoS2 and rGO@MoS2–CdS, in which the peaks of CdS and rGO are weakened by MoS2 overlayers, respectively. Besides, additional MoS2 peaks can be observed at 378.9 and 403.7 cm−1 in the spectra of rGO–CdS@MoS2, rGO@MoS2–CdS and CdS@MoS2 samples, representing the vibration modes of E2g1 and Ag1, respectively.48 The light absorption properties of the CdS based samples are further revealed by the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. 3l), in which all the samples show comparable light absorption in the 200–520 nm wavelength range without an obvious change in the absorption edge of CdS. Compared to bare CdS, additional broad background absorption in the 520–800 nm region can be observed in the CdS based hybrid samples, which can be attributed to the optical absorption of rGO and MoS2.
3.2 Photocatalytic performance analysis
The photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of the as-obtained rGO–CdS@MoS2 was then evaluated under visible light irradiation (420 < λ < 780 nm) with the addition of lactic acid as the hole scavenger. Fig. 4a shows the average H2 production rates of rGO–CdS@MoS2 with different loading amounts of CdS in the first hour (detailed contents in Table S1†). With the increase of the CdS content, it can be clearly seen that the H2 evolution rate increases initially and then decreases, which achieves the highest value of 14.4 mmol gcat−1 h−1 when the CdS content is 90 wt%, corresponding to an apparent quantum efficiency of 23.7% at 420 nm. Generally, a low percentage of CdS increases the light shielding effect of rGO and MoS2, while a large percentage of CdS cannot guarantee the uniform dispersion of CdS on rGO and full coverage of CdS by MoS2. As a consequence, a suitable content of CdS is crucial for optimizing the photocatalytic activity of rGO–CdS@MoS2. The photocatalytic activity of the optimized rGO–CdS@MoS2 is further compared with those of reference samples. For facilitating the performance comparison and following mechanism studies, the mass ratios of CdS:rGO and/or CdS:MoS2 in all the samples are kept the same (Table S1†). As shown in Fig. 4b, a remarkably higher H2 evolution rate of rGO–CdS@MoS2 can be observed in the first hour, which is 17.9, 5.0, 2.5 and 2.0 times greater than those of pristine CdS, rGO–CdS, CdS@MoS2 and rGO@MoS2–CdS, respectively. With the extension of the illumination time, the H2 yields gradually increase for all the samples (Fig. 4c). After 4 h of visible light irradiation, pristine CdS shows a H2 production amount of 3.0 mmol gcat−1. The introduction of rGO and MoS2 significantly increases the H2 amount to 7.5 and 13.3 mmol gcat−1 over rGO–CdS and CdS@MoS2, respectively, indicating that rGO and MoS2 can improve the photocatalytic activity of CdS. When both rGO and MoS2 are involved, rGO@MoS2–CdS and rGO–CdS@MoS2 display further improved photoactivity owing to the synergistic interplay between them. Especially, the H2 production amount over rGO–CdS@MoS2 reaches 41.3 mmol gcat−1, superior to that of rGO@MoS2–CdS (19.1 mmol gcat−1), suggesting that the synergetic effect between rGO and MoS2 is greatly dependent on the architectures of the ternary nanostructures.
 Fig. 4  Photocatalytic performance of CdS based samples: (a) photocatalytic H2 production rates over rGO–CdS@MoS2 with different loading amounts of CdS for 1 h, (b) comparison of H2 production rates over different CdS based samples for 1 h and (c) their amounts of H2 generation in 4 h, and (d) cycling tests of photocatalytic H2 evolution over rGO–CdS@MoS2 with CdS as a reference sample. 
Given that the stability is as important as activity for the practical applications of semiconductor-based photocatalytic materials, the photostability of rGO–CdS@MoS2 is evaluated with pure CdS as a reference. As shown in Fig. 4d, after five cycles with a total irradiation time of 20 h, the H2 evolution activity of blank CdS has deteriorated by ca. 39.4%, displaying a serious photoactivity declination. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis of the reaction solution after the photocatalytic cycles shows a Cd2+ leaching of about 7.3%. In contrast, the H2 evolution amount over rGO–CdS@MoS2 remains relatively stable in the cycling test without obvious Cd2+ leaching detected, which only reduces by 3.5% after the recycling test, indicating the good photostability and strong anti-photocorrosion of the designed rGO–CdS@MoS2. As revealed by the TEM images, XRD patterns and XPS spectra, the morphology, structure and composition of rGO–CdS@MoS2 are well maintained after the cycles (Fig. S6–S8†). In contrast, marked photocorrosion of pristine CdS can be observed after the cycles (Fig. S9†). The above results clearly imply that the incorporation of CdS nanospheres at the interfaces between rGO and MoS2 not only boosts the photocatalytic activity but also improves the anti-photocorrosion of the CdS photocatalyst. Notably, the photocatalytic performance of rGO–CdS@MoS2 in H2 evolution also outperforms those of reported state-of-the-art composite photocatalysts composed of rGO, CdS and MoS2 measured under similar conditions (Table S2†).21,23,38,49–53
3.3 Photocatalytic mechanism studies
To further unravel the origin of the above photocatalytic results, a series of electrochemical, photoelectrochemical and photoluminescence (PL) tests have been conducted to comparatively study the charge kinetics process in different samples. Fig. 5a displays the polarization curves of the samples, from which it can be seen that the introduction of rGO leads to a slight increase in the current density of CdS, while the further coating of MoS2 significantly raises the current density, proving the cocatalyst role of MoS2 in lowering the overpotential. Furthermore, exposed with the same MoS2 overlayers, rGO–CdS@MoS2 exhibits a higher current density in comparison with CdS@MoS2 and rGO@MoS2–CdS, suggesting that the unique stacked structure facilitates the electron transport. Then electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has been carried out to gain insight into the resistance of charge migration. As shown in Fig. 5b, the EIS plots are fitted with an appropriate equivalent circuit and the stimulated charge-transfer resistances (Rct) for rGO–CdS, CdS@MoS2, rGO@MoS2–CdS and rGO–CdS@MoS2 are determined to be 45.5, 55.2, 38.6 and 25.8 Ω cm−2, respectively (Table S3†), verifying a smaller charge transfer resistance in rGO–CdS@MoS2.
 Fig. 5  Charge kinetics analyses of CdS based samples: (a) polarization curves and (b) EIS Nyquist plots, (c) photocurrent responses under visible light irradiation, (d) steady-state PL emission spectra excited at 310 nm, (e) photovoltages under visible light irradiation, and (f) average lifetimes of the photo-generated charge carriers obtained from transient photovoltage measurements. 
The photocurrent responses have been studied to reveal the separation behaviors of photogenerated charge carriers under visible light irradiation. As shown in Fig. 5c, the coupling of rGO and MoS2 significantly elevates the photocurrent response of pristine CdS in the following order: CdS@MoS2 < rGO–CdS < rGO@MoS2–CdS < rGO–CdS@MoS2, suggesting improved electron–hole separation efficiencies. The higher photocurrent density of rGO–CdS over CdS@MoS2 indicates that rGO is more effective in separating the charge carriers in comparison with MoS2. The different photocurrents between rGO–MoS2@CdS and rGO–CdS@MoS2 imply that the stacking sequence of MoS2 and CdS on the rGO support is also critical to the carrier separation behavior. The statement is also confirmed by the PL emission spectra excited at 310 nm. As depicted in Fig. 5d, the PL peak of CdS at around 535 nm is obviously quenched upon incorporating rGO and MoS2, and the quenching degrees are in the same sequence as the photocurrent enhancements. The weakest PL intensity of rGO–CdS@MoS2 suggests more efficient prevention of charge recombination through radiative pathways.
The photo-induced carrier kinetics was further investigated by transient open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements under visible light irradiation. As shown in Fig. 5e, the photovoltage signals of different samples are in well agreement with the photocurrent and PL results. In comparison with other samples, more negative photovoltage is realized by rGO–CdS@MoS2, suggesting the migration of more separated photoelectrons to the counter electrode. The average lifetime of the photogenerated carriers (τn) was then estimated from the open-circuit voltage (Voc) decay according to the following equation: (2)where τn represents the average lifetime, Voc is the open-circuit voltage, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature (in Kelvin), and q is the unsigned charge of an electron. Fig. 5f shows a prolonged τn of rGO–CdS@MoS2 relative to other samples, further evidencing more efficient separation of photogenerated carriers during the photocatalytic reactions.
To gain an in-depth insight into the improved charge kinetics of rGO–CdS@MoS2, the electronic structures of the components involved were determined by a combination of UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, valence-band XPS spectroscopy and Mott–Schottky plots. Given that the metallic MoS2 is a mixture of 1T and 2H phases, high-purity 1T and 2H-MoS2 were synthesized according to a previous report together with bare rGO for mechanism analyses (Fig. S10†).54 According to the optical absorbance spectra (Fig. 3i and inset of Fig. 6a), the bandgaps of CdS and semiconducting 2H-MoS2 were determined by using the equation: (αhν)n = A(hν − Eg)(3)where α is the absorption coefficient, hν is the light energy, A is a constant, Eg is the optical bandgap, and n is equal to 1/2 for an indirect bandgap and 2 for a direct bandgap, respectively. Based on the curve plot for (αhν)2 and (αhν)1/2versus hν in Fig. 6a, the bandgaps are determined to be 2.42 and 1.73 eV for direct bandgap CdS and indirect bandgap 2H-MoS2, respectively. According to the Mott–Schottky plots (Fig. 6b), both CdS and 2H-MoS2 exhibit n-type semiconductor characteristics with positive slopes for the curve of 1/C2versus potential, and their flat band potentials are determined to be −0.79 and −0.56 V versus the Ag/AgCl electrode (vs. Ag/AgCl), respectively. Moreover, the flat band potentials of conducting rGO and 1T-MoS2 are measured to be −0.67 and −0.48 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively. In other words, the Fermi levels (Ef) of CdS, 2H-MoS2, rGO and 1T-MoS2 are −0.59, −0.36, −0.47 and −0.28 V versus the normal hydrogen electrode (vs. NHE) according to the equation: ENHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.1976 (25 °C). Valence-band XPS spectra in Fig. 6c suggest that the energy gaps between the Ef and valence band (VB) are 1.97 and 1.54 eV for CdS and 2H-MoS2, respectively.55 Thus the VB positions of CdS and 2H-MoS2 are 1.38 and 1.18 V vs. NHE, and then based on the optical bandgaps, their conduction band (CB) positions are calculated to be −1.04 and −0.55 V vs. NHE, respectively. Based on the above results, the experimentally determined electronic band alignment between CdS, 2H-MoS2, 1T-MoS2 and rGO is displayed in Fig. 6d. It can be seen that the CB position of CdS is more negative than the Ef of 1T-MoS2 and rGO. With the excitation of rGO–CdS@MoS2 by visible light, photogenerated electrons in CdS can either directly transfer to 1T-MoS2 or shuttle across the rGO to 1T-MoS2. Moreover, CdS exhibits a more negative CB position and positive VB position compared with 2H-MoS2. Thus a type-I junction is formed between them, in which photo-excited electrons and holes would be transferred from CdS to the CB and VB of 2H-MoS2, respectively.56,57 Though the inverted type-I alignment is not conducive to charge separation as compared with the staggered type-II one, it is a better choice for core–shell-structured semiconductor junctions when isolated cores act as the light harvesting component given that the confinement of either electrons or holes in the core would result in more serious charge recombination.58–61

When the architecture of rGO–CdS@MoS2 is further taken into consideration, the enhanced photoactivity and promoted photostability can be well explained. As illustrated in Scheme 1, on one hand, the stacked structure provides a close contact between the CdS core and few-layered MoS2 shell with a large interfacial area, which makes sure the fast migration of photoelectrons from CdS to 1T/2H-MoS2 cocatalysts for H2 evolution. Moreover, the high percentage of the 1T phase guarantees the high mobility of photo-excited electrons and abundant active sites in the metallic MoS2 cocatalysts for H2 production, contributing to the interfacial charge separation and surface proton reduction.62 On the other hand, the MoS2 and rGO completely wrap the CdS core and serve as protective layers to preserve CdS from photocorrosion, in which 2H-MoS2 in the shell accepts the photo-generated holes from the CdS core and isolates them from the sulfide surface, while the rGO support as an additional conductive channel enables the high-speed migration of excessive electrons from the CdS core to the neighboring MoS2 outer layers for H2 evolution, alleviating their recombination with holes in the MoS2 shells and allowing the participation of more MoS2 in the proton reduction. Namely, two pathways for electron transfer including “CdS → MoS2” and “CdS → rGO → MoS2” are involved into the photocatalytic system, in which the “CdS → rGO → MoS2” pathway can effectively prevent the charge carrier recombination occurring in the “CdS → MoS2” one. In contrast, all the CdS based reference photocatalysts suffer from intrinsic drawbacks (Scheme 1). For CdS and rGO–CdS, the catalytic activity and stability are restricted by the lack of MoS2 cocatalysts and anti-photocorrosion layers. Despite the existence of MoS2 cocatalysts in rGO@MoS2–CdS, the CdS is also exposed to the ambient atmosphere and cannot be protected from photocorrosion, while the small contact area between CdS and MoS2 is not conducive to the smooth interfacial charge transfer and separation, implying that the stacking order of the components is also important during the construction of stacked photocatalytic nanostructures. Though the above shortcomings can be eliminated in the sample of CdS@MoS2, serious recombination of photo-excited electrons and holes cannot be avoided when both of them migrate from CdS cores to MoS2 shells.

4. Conclusions
In summary, a novel stacking design has been developed with CdS firstly supported by rGO nanosheets and then overlapped with few-layered metallic MoS2 nanoflakes. In ternary photocatalysts, not only the matched energy level position and large-area intimate contact between the CdS core and MoS2 shell facilitate the highly efficient migration of photogenerated electrons to the MoS2 cocatalysts, but also the high-content 1T phase in the cocatalysts enables high-mobility electron transport and high-density active sites for H2 evolution. Meanwhile, CdS cores are completely wrapped by MoS2 and rGO layers and protected from photocorrosion, in which the MoS2 shell accepts the photogenerated holes from CdS and impedes the oxidation of S2−, while the rGO support delivers the excessive electrons from the CdS to the neighboring MoS2 outer layers for H2 evolution, alleviating the carrier recombination in the MoS2 shells and enabling the participation of more MoS2 in the proton reduction reaction. As a result, the designed rGO–CdS@MoS2 photocatalyst displays an outstanding photocatalytic activity and stability in H2 production and shows the highest rate of 14.4 mmol gcat−1 h−1, which is about 17.9, 5.0, 2.5 and 2.0 times higher than those of bare CdS, rGO–CdS, CdS@MoS2 and rGO@MoS2–CdS, respectively. This study highlights the advantages of stack-structured photocatalysts and the importance of rationally choosing the stacking order of components during the construction of the photocatalysts.
