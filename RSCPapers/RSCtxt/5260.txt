    , Accepted 12th February 2022First published on 14th February 2022AbstractPorous hollow structures of electrode materials can enlarge the surface area in contact with electrolytes, accelerating the transport of ions and electrons during redox reactions to enhance the electrochemical performance of the electrode materials. Herein, this work presents a facile method to synthesize NiCo2Se4 hollow microspheres (NiCo2Se4 HMSs) and BiSe hollow microspheres (BiSe HMSs) based on a self-template and selenide strategy. NiCo2Se4 HMSs deliver a high specific capacitance of 262.0 mA h g−1 (1874.6 F g−1) at a current density of 1 A g−1 and good rate capability (74.9% capacitance retention at 20 A g−1), which is superior to many Ni/Co-based electrode materials. Meanwhile, BiSe HMSs show an amazing capacitance of 360 mA h g−1 (1293 F g−1) at 1 A g−1 and excellent rate capability (62.6% capacitance retention at 40 A g−1). On account of the unique chemical composition and structural features, the assembled NiCo2Se4 HMSs//BiSe HMSs asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) exhibit high energy density (76.73 W h kg−1 at 1.79 kW kg−1) and good capacitance retention (93.4%) after 3000 cycles. This study suggests that these unique selenide structures have potential applications in fabricating high-performance ASCs, which is expected to be one of highly prospective energy storage devices.
1. Introductions
Nowadays, the development of renewable and clean energy sources has become an urgent need in the world, due to the environmental pollution caused by the consumption of fossil fuels in the last century.1–3 At the same time, the practical application of these renewable and clean energy sources has driven the demand for efficient and green energy storage devices. Compared with solar cells,4 fuel cells,5 batteries,6etc., supercapacitors stand out among various electrochemical energy storage devices due to their high power density, cycling stability, fast charge–discharge and environmentally friendly nature,7–9 which have long attracted the great attention of researchers. However, the practical applications of supercapacitors face great challenges due to their relatively low energy density. On the basis of the formula , the energy density (E) depends on working voltage (V) and specific capacitance (C), which actually rely on the active materials. According to the energy storage mechanisms, supercapacitors can be classified into electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors,10,11 and the latter, causing fast and reversible redox reactions on the surface of active materials, provides much larger specific capacitance and higher energy density than the former.12,13 Therefore, pseudocapacitive materials have gradually become important for researchers.
In recent years, transition metal hydroxides (Ni(OH)2,14 NiCo-LDH,15etc.), transition metal oxides (NiO,16 CuCo2O4,17 Co3O4/NiCo2O4,18etc.) and transition metal sulfides (Co9S8,19 NiS2/MoS2,20 NiCo2S4,21etc.) have been widely investigated as positive electrode materials for supercapacitors due to their multiple Faradaic redox reactions and high theoretical capacity.22,23 However, these materials still suffer from inferior electrical conductivity and relatively low energy density, which greatly restricts their extensive applications in energy storage applications. Therefore, it is imperative to develop new transition metal-based electrode materials with high electrical conductivity, improved energy density, highly porous structure and good electrochemical stability. Recently, it has been reported that transition metal selenides (Co0.85Se,24 NiSe2,25 Ni–Co–Se,26etc.) show excellent pseudocapacitive properties due to their intrinsic stability, high electrical conductivity, rich redox reactions and excellent electrochemical properties.27,28 Selenium, with better metallic property, has lower electronegativity and higher electron conducting rate (1 × 10−3 S m−1) than O and S, and can effectively enhance the electrical conductivity of the electrodes, due to anion exchange providing a smaller band gap.29,30 Therefore, transition metal selenides could be potential candidates in energy storage fields. Among numerous selenide-based materials, bimetallic selenide materials have caught the most notable attention owing to their simple anion exchange preparation method, tunable chemical compositions, satisfactory stability and reversible redox reactions.31–33 For instance, Zhang et al. synthesized hierarchical urchin-like MnCo–selenide on a nickel foam by a simple and binder-free hydrothermal method. The electrode exhibited an outstanding specific capacitance of 1656 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and excellent cycle performance (91.8% after 8000 cycles).34 Zhao et al. reported a one-step electrodeposited synthesis strategy for directly growing NiCoSe2/Ni3Se2 lamella arrays (LAs) on N-doped graphene nanotubes (N-GNTs) as positive electrodes, which delivers a specific capacity of ∼1308 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 1000 F g−1 at 100 A g−1, indicating excellent rate performance (∼76.5%).35 Xu et al. reported hollow NiSe2/CoSe2 bimetallic selenides for supercapacitors, designed by using ZIF-67 as a template. The electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 1668 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and excellent rate capability (the capacitance retention of 82.8% at 20 A g−1).36 Particularly, nickel–cobalt selenide composite materials have been widely studied owing to their high theoretical specific capacitance and electrochemical activity.37 Although these bimetallic nickel cobalt selenides provide enhanced electrochemical performance, their desirable ionic permeability, specific capacitance, specific energy density, rate capability and electrochemical stability still need to be improved to meet the requirements for practical application in large-scale energy storage.
Another effective way to improve the energy density of supercapacitors is to realize the matching of asymmetric encapsulation. Currently, carbonaceous materials such as active carbon, porous carbon, carbon nanotubes, carbon aerogels and graphenes, showing high electrical conductivity, large specific surface area and chemical stability, have been widely employed as negative materials.38,39 However, the low theoretical specific capacitance of carbonaceous materials restricts their energy density and further applications in supercapacitors.40 Through the in-depth study of the negative materials, researchers found that some negative materials with high electrochemical performance and a suitable anode voltage window could be used as an alternative to carbon-based materials. For instance, Chavan et al. reported Hematite α-Fe2O3 thin films by spray pyrolysis from a non-aqueous medium, showing a specific capacitance of 451 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 with a potential window ranging from −1.1 to 0.2 V.41 Han et al. prepared Bi2O3 microrods with a carbon coat (Bi2O3@C) by a facile metal–organic framework (MOF)-derived strategy, which exhibited a high specific capacity of 1378 C g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and excellent cycle life (93% after 4000 cycles).42 Despite these achievements, these metal compounds usually suffer from unsatisfactory rate capability, low electronic conductivity or inferior stability, leading to the unsatisfactory electrochemical performance. Therefore, more perfect materials with improved electrical conductivity should be explored to present satisfactory electrochemical performance.
In addition, it has been demonstrated that the hollow micro-structure of materials is also a significant factor to enhance the electrochemical properties. Therefore, how to design and construct reasonable nanostructured multiphase transition metal selenides to significantly improve the energy and power density of supercapacitors has become our primary task to solve. The hollow/porous structure including sufficient electroactive sites, large specific surface areas, increasing volume change accommodation and accelerating ion/electron diffusion and transport can effectively enhance rich redox reactions to store energy and then enhance the electrochemical performance for supercapacitors.43,44 At present, hard/soft template methods,45–47 self-template methods48,49 and the Kirkendall effect route50 and so on are widely used to obtain the hollow structure. Among these methodologies, the self-template method stands out owing to good structure control ability, simple operation, low cost and the ease for mass production. For example, Karimi et al. successfully prepared a nanoporous CuCo2S4 (CCS) microsphere electrode by a facile self-template method, exhibiting an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 1566 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 and a superb cycle life (95.7% retention after 5000 cycles).51 Davarani et al. introduced a self-template method to synthesize multi-shelled nickel–manganese selenide hollow spheres (MSNMSeHSs) as cathode electrode materials and double-shell nickel–iron selenide hollow spheres (DSNFSeHSs) as anode electrode materials with an adjustable number of shells.52 The MSNMSeHS electrode showed a high specific capacitance of 1221.1 C g−1 at 2 A g−1, impressive rate capability (78.7%, at 32 A g−1) and excellent cycle performance (95.7% after 10000 cycles). The DSNFSeHS electrode exhibited a capacity of 930.25 C g−1, high rate capability (75.5%, at 32 A g−1) and long cycle life (90.9%, after 10000 cycles). The device fabricated by the two electrodes delivered an amazing energy density of 112.6 W h kg−1 at 0.9 kW kg−1. Therefore, the self-template method could be a promising approach for constructing hollow structures to obtain high-performance supercapacitors.
Herein, we synthesized NiCo2Se4 HMSs and BiSe HMSs with unique porous hollow structure by self-template methods. Based on cavity structure, especially the phase composition, the two prepared electrodes undoubtedly showed high specific capacitances and outstanding rate capabilities. Meaningfully, an asymmetric supercapacitor device assembled with a NiCo2Se4 HMS positive electrode and a BiSe HMS negative electrode delivered a high energy density of 76.7 W h kg−1 at a power density of 1.79 kW kg−1 and retained 93.4% of its initial capacitance after 3000 charge-discharges at 5 A g−1, indicating excellent cycle stability. Finally, we connected the two devices in series and lighted up 35 LEDs. Therefore, the ASC device is expected to show practical applicability in energy conversion and storage devices.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Glucose (C6H12O6·H2O), bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O), cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O), nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O), urea, hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), hydrazine hydrate (H4N2·H2O), Se powder, absolute methanol (CH3OH) and absolute ethanol (CH3CH2OH) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All reagents were of analytical grade, and do not require further purification.
2.2. Synthesis of NiCo2O4 hollow microspheres (NiCo2O4 HMSs) and NiCo2Se4 hollow microspheres (NiCo2Se4 HMSs)
First, 0.3 mmol Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.6 mmol (Co(NO3)2·6H2O) and 0.1 mmol glucose were dissolved in 40 mL ethanol absolute containing 2 mmol urea. After stirring for 2 h, the mixture was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and kept at 160 °C for 14 h. After cooling to room temperature naturally, the precursor was washed several times with deionized water and ethanol and dried at 60 °C overnight. Finally, the dry precursor was annealed at 400 °C for 2 h at a mean rate of 1 °C min−1 in air to obtain NiCo2O4 HMSs. Similarly, NiCo2O4 micron flakes (NiCo2O4 MFs) without glucose were obtained under the same procedure for comparison.
NiCo2Se4 HMSs were synthesized in a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. The as-prepared precursor NiCo2O4 HMSs were dispersed in 30 mL deionized water, and 0.1 mmol Se power was dissolved in 5 mL N2H4 solution. After stirring for 30 min, the thoroughly mixed solution was transferred into an autoclave and kept at 140 °C for 3 h. The obtained black color product was washed several times with ethanol and dried at 60 °C. The preparation method of NiCo2Se4 MFs is similar to that of NiCo2Se4 HMSs by replacing NiCo2O4 HMSs with NiCo2O4 MFs.
2.3. Synthesis of Bi2O3 microspheres (Bi2O3 MSs) and BiSe hollow microspheres (BiSe HMSs)
First, 0.3 mmol Bi(NO3)3·6H2O and 0.2 mmol glucose were dispersed in 70 mL absolute methanol, followed by the addition of 0.1 mmol CTAB. After stirring for 2 h, the mixture was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave for reaction at 180 °C for 24 h. After cooling down naturally, the precursor was collected and washed several times with deionized water and ethanol and then dried at 60 °C overnight. Finally, the dry precursor was annealed at 400 °C for 2 h at a heating rate of 1 °C min−1 in air to obtain Bi2O3 MSs. For comparison, Bi2O3 nanoparticles (Bi2O3 NPs) were also synthesized under the same condition but without the addition of glucose.
Similarly, BiSe HMSs were obtained according to the route of NiCo2Se4 HMSs, but the hydrothermal temperature rose to 160 °C. The preparation method of BiSe NPs is consistent with BiSe HMSs.
2.4. Material characterization
The morphology and microstructure of the as-synthesized materials were investigated by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4800 operating at 5 kV) and field-emission transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Hitachi HT-7700 operating at 120 kV). The elemental presence and composition were identified by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and XPS analysis (Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD). The XRD patterns were collected using an X-ray diffraction spectrometer (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance, Cu Kα radiation) operating at 40 kV and 40 mA. The lattice structure was characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL JEM 2100) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller measurements (Quantachrome Instruments) were carried out to obtain the surface area and pore size distribution of the as-synthesized materials.
2.5. Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical tests including cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of electrode materials were carried out using a CHI660E electrochemical workstation (Chenhua Instrument Co., Shanghai, China) in a three-electrode system at room temperature. An active material electrode, a Hg/HgO electrode and a Pt wire electrode were used as the working, reference and counter electrodes in 3 M KOH aqueous solution, respectively. The working electrodes were prepared by mixing 70 wt% active materials, 20 wt% acetylene black and 10 wt% PVDF onto a nickel foam and then drying at 60 °C for 12 h.
The specific capacitance (C, F g−1) of the as-prepared electrodes was calculated using the following formula.53,54 (1)where I represents the discharging current (A), Δt is the discharging time (s), m is the mass of the active material (g) and ΔV is the operating voltage window (V).
To further study the practical application of NiCo2Se4 HMS and BiSe HMS electrodes, the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device was assembled using a NiCo2Se4 HMS electrode as the positive electrode and a BiSe HMS electrode as the negative electrode (scheme in Fig. 1). A fiber was used as a separator and soaked in 3 M KOH electrolyte solution. The optimized mass ratio between the positive and negative electrode materials for NiCo2Se4 HMSs//BiSe HMSs device can be calculated based on the charge balance relationship (q+ = q−) in the following equation:55 (2)where C (F g−1) is the specific capacitance, V (V) is the potential window, and m (g) is the mass of the active material. In addition, the optimized mass ratio is about 1:1.28 for NiCo2Se4 HMSs/BiSe HMSs by calculation.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterizations of NiCo2Se4 HMSs and BiSe HMSs
The schematic representation of the synthesis process for the NiCo2Se4 HMS positive electrode and the BiSe HMS negative electrode and the construction of the ASC device are depicted in Fig. 1a. NiCo2O4 and Bi2O3 MSs were obtained by a simple hydrothermal or solvothermal method followed by the annealing process. The corresponding characterization details of the NiCo2O4/Bi2O3 precursor and NiCo2O4 HMs/Bi2O3 MSs are displayed in supporting information (Fig. S1–S6†). Then, NiCo2Se4 and BiSe HMSs were successfully prepared by an effective anion-exchange process for selenylation. The preparation process involves the following chemical equations:45,58 (CH2)6N4 + 10H2O → C6H2O + 4NH4+ + 4OH−(5) Glucose + 2Co2+ + Ni2+ + 6OH− → NiCo2(OH)6/C(6) Glucose + Bi3+ + 3OH− → Bi(OH)3/C(7) NiCo2(OH)6/C + O2 → NiCo2O4 + CO2 + 3H2O(8) Bi(OH)3/C + O2 → Bi2O3 + CO2 + 3H2O(9) N2H4 + 2Se → N2 + 2H2Se(10) H2Se + NiCo2O4 → NiCo2Se4 + H2O(11) Bi2O3 + 3H2Se → BiSe + 3H2O(12)
The SEM images of NiCo2Se4 HMSs (Fig. 1b and c) show hollow porous and three-dimensional microspheres with loose nanosheets, made up of small size particles. The average size of these microspheres is about 700 nm. The XRD pattern was tested to investigate the phase purity and crystallinity of the prepared NiCo2Se4 HMSs (Fig. 1d). The XRD pattern of the NiCo2Se4 HMSs reveals the major diffraction peaks fitting with the standard cards of NiCo2Se4 (JCPDS no. 04-006-5241). Obviously, there are no other impurity phases found in the XRD pattern, indicating the good phase purity of NiCo2Se4 HMSs. Similarly, The SEM images (Fig. 1e and f) also confirm a three-dimensional hollow structure of BiSe HMSs with thick nanosheets, whose average size is around 750 nm. The XRD pattern of BiSe HMSs is shown in Fig. 1g. The diffraction peaks at 29.16°, 40.26° and 43.25° are indexed to the (104), (108) and (110) planes of a BiSe phase (JCPDS card no. 29-0246). It is indicated that the as-synthesized BiSe HMSs were successfully prepared. In addition, as comparative experiments, characterizations (SEM and XRD) were carried out to analyze the morphology/phase for NiCo2O4 MFs, NiCo2Se4 MFs, Bi2O3 NPs and BiSe NPs. Fig. S7a† shows the SEM image of micro-flakes morphology for NiCo2O4 (without glucose). The XRD pattern (Fig. S7c†) with diffraction peaks at 36.7°, 44.6°, 59.1° and 65.0° correspond to the (311), (400), (511) and (440) planes, respectively, identified as NiCo2O4 (JCPDS no. 20-0781). The precursor NiCo2O4 MFs was turned into NiCo2Se4 MFs by anion exchange. The SEM image and XRD pattern of NiCo2Se4 MFs are shown in Fig. S7b and d.† It can be found that NiCo2Se4 MFs consist of micro-flakes. The obtained NiCo2Se4 MFs showed weak characteristic diffraction peaks at 33.30°, 44.18°, and 51.42°, which correspond to the (002), (311) and (−313) planes of the NiCo2Se4 phase according to JCPDS no. 04-006-5241. Fig. S8a† shows the SEM image of Bi2O3 (without glucose) composed of irregular nanoparticles. The obvious diffraction peaks at 27.9°, 31.8°, 32.7°, 46.2°, 46.9°, 55.5° and 55.7° in the XRD pattern (Fig. S8c†), correspond to the (201), (002), (220), (222), (400), (421) and (213) planes of Bi2O3 (JCPDS no. 27-0050). The morphology of BiSe (without glucose) also shows small nanosheets in comparison with Bi2O3 NPs after selenylation, as shown in Fig. S8b.† The XRD pattern of BiSe NPs (Fig. S8d†) can be identified as BiSe (JCPDS no. 29-0246).
TEM, HRTEM, SAED, SEM mapping images and XPS of NiCo2Se4 HMSs are displayed in Fig. 2. The intrinsic morphology of NiCo2Se4 HMSs characterized by TEM (Fig. 2a) is consistent with the SEM images. In addition to this, we also find that the spheres are hollow and porous, and their surfaces are covered by disordered rough nanosheets. The corresponding microstructure of NiCo2Se4 HMSs is exhibited in the HRTEM image (Fig. 2b). The lattice fringes with interplanar distances of 0.176 nm and 0.267 nm correspond to the (−313) and (111) crystal planes of NiCo2Se4 (JCPDS. no. 04-006-5241). Meanwhile, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of NiCo2Se4 HMSs (Fig. 2c) demonstrates clear diffraction rings, which could be assigned to the (−313) and (111) planes of NiCo2Se4 (JCPDS. no. 04-006-5241). The SEM mapping images of NiCo2Se4 HMSs indicate the coexistence of Ni, Co and Se elements, representing that O2− was effectively replaced with Se2− (Fig. 2d–g). Furthermore, the chemical composition of NiCo2Se4 was examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The full survey of the NiCo2Se4 HMSs in Fig. S9a† confirms the coexistence of Ni, Co, O and Se. The high-resolution Ni 2p spectra of NiCo2Se4 HMSs are displayed in Fig. 2h. The two peaks at 855.43 eV and 873.12 eV are ascribed to the Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 orbits, respectively, while the energy gap between the two peaks (17.69 eV) demonstrates the valance state of Ni2+.59,60 860.89 eV and 879.37 eV attributed to the shakeup satellites. For the high-resolution Co 2p spectra (Fig. 2i), the peaks located at 780.32 eV for Co 2p3/2 and 796.05 eV Co 2p1/2 correspond to the characteristics of Co3+. In addition, a pair of peaks at 781.59 eV and 797.69 eV associate with the Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 orbits, respectively, corresponding to the characteristics of Co2+.61,62 In addition, the peaks at 786.0 eV and 802. 32 eV are related to shakeup satellites peaks. Fig. 2j shows the high-resolution spectra of Se 3d. The two peaks at 53.6 eV and 54.65 eV were assigned to Se 3d5/2 and 3d3/2, representing the existence of Se2− in NiCo2Se4 HMSs and are consistent with the previous report.63 The high-resolution O 1s spectra of NiCo2Se4 are analyzed in detail. The binding energies at 530.5 and 532.3 eV (Fig. 2k), representing surface –OH (O1) and chemisorbed H2O (O2) demonstrated that NiCo2O4 is selenized completely.17,22 The single peak at around 59.39 eV belongs to SeOx, due to the oxidization of selenium in air.45,64–66 These results confirm the successful synthesis of the NiCo2Se4 materials.

Similarly, the intrinsic morphology, chemical composition and microstructure analysis of the BiSe HMSs were explored by TEM, HRTEM, SAED, XPS and SEM mapping. Fig. 3a shows the TEM image of BiSe HMSs, which clearly demonstrates the hollow porous structure of BiSe HMSs. The thick nanosheets are closely attached onto the surface of spheres with a diameter of around 700–750 nm. An anion exchange process between the lattice oxygen from Bi2O3 microspheres and Se2− released from a H2Se solution led to the formation of BiSe hollow microspheres via the Kirkendall effect.67 The Se2− ions first react with Bi2O3 microspheres, and then a thin layer of BiSe is formed on the surface of Bi2O3. According to the Kirkendall effect,54,68,69 the unequal diffusion O2− outward and Se2− invading produces voids close to the interface. In our approach, along with the reaction proceeding, the interior of Bi2O3 microspheres decomposed and the external network layer of BiSe increased into a hollow structure. The HRTEM image (Fig. 3b) of BiSe HMSs displays a crystal structure with lattice spacings of 0.307 nm and 0.222 nm, corresponding to the (104) and (108) planes of BiSe, further revealing the polycrystalline property. Moreover, the SAED pattern of BiSe HMSs is presented in Fig. 3c and exhibits obvious diffraction rings, which can be indexed to the (110), (104) and (108) planes of BiSe, respectively. The uniform elemental distribution of Bi and Se elements is further evidenced by the SEM mapping images in Fig. 3d–f. Fig. S9b† shows the XPS survey spectrum of BiSe HMSs, indicating the presence of Bi, Se, O and C elements. The high-resolution Bi 4f spectra are exhibited in Fig. 3g. The binding energies of 157.89 eV and 163.25 eV could be attributed to Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2. In addition, the difference between them is 5.36 eV, which are the features of the Bi(IV) states.70–72 The binding energies of 158.73 eV for Bi 4f7/2 and 164.0 eV for Bi 4f5/2 derive from the partial oxidation of BiSe by oxygen throughout long-term exposure to air.73–75 The Se 3d spectra of BiSe HMSs are depicted in Fig. 3h, where the peaks located at 53.53 eV and 54.73 eV could be ascribed to Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2.75,76 We further analyze the high-resolution O 1s spectra of BiSe HMSs to investigate the degree of selenylation of Bi2O3. The binding energies at 529.7 eV (O1), 531.6 eV (O2) and 533.1 eV (O3) could be assigned to the Bi–O bond, the absorbed oxygen in CO and O–H, respectively (Fig. 3i). It can be found that although the material is purely BiSe, as characterized by XRD, there are a small amount of Bi–O bonds in the material.40,42 The peak at 58.4 eV corresponds to SeOx, which is due to partial oxidation in air.77

3.2. Electrochemical performance of NiCo2Se4 HMSs and BiSe HMSs
The electrochemical performance of the as-obtained electrode materials was examined using a three-electrode system. Fig. 4a displays the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the NiCo2Se4 HMSs electrode at different scan rates ranging from 5 to 60 mV s−1 in the potential windows of −0.2–0.8 V, which exhibit a pair of obvious redox peaks, indicating reversible and rich redox reactions of Co2+/Co3+and Ni2+/Ni3+.78–80 It is worth noting that the shapes of CV curves are maintained as the scan rates increase from 5 to 60 mV s−1, implying that the NiCo2Se4 HMS electrode has a superior rate capability and remarkable electrochemical kinetics. The charge–discharge (GCD) curves at different current densities from 1 to 20 A g−1 in the potential range of 0.0 and 0.5 V are shown in Fig. 4b. The obvious pseudocapacitive properties are discovered in the voltage range from 0.2 to 0.31 V, ascribed to the charge-transfer kinetics and redox reaction process between the interface of the electro de and the electrolyte.81 The specific capacitances of the NiCo2Se4 HMS electrode are 1874.6, 1839, 1736, 1685, 1650 and 1405 F g−1 at current densities of 1, 2, 5, 8, 10 and 20 A g−1, respectively. In order to demonstrate the superior electrochemical performance of the NiCo2Se4 HMS electrode, NiCo2Se4 MFs were prepared without adding glucose as a comparative electrode. The corresponding electrochemical tests are shown in Fig. S10.† The CV curves (Fig. S10a†) of the NiCo2Se4 MF electrode also show a pair of redox peaks, indicating the faradaic behavior. According to the discharging time, the specific capacitances of the NiCo2Se4 MFs electrode are 1145.6, 1126, 1090, 1032, 1002 and 847.6 F g−1 at different current densities of 1–20 A g−1, respectively (Fig. S10b†). Obviously, the NiCo2Se4 HMS electrode shows a higher specific capacitance (1874.6 F g−1) than that of the NiCo2Se4 MF electrode (1145.6 F g−1). It can be observed that the rate capability of the NiCo2Se4 HMS electrode (74.9%) is also superior to that of the NiCo2Se4 MFs electrode (73.9%), as shown in Fig. 4c. The exceptional electrochemical performance of the as-obtained NiCo2Se4 HMSs is attributed to the micro-/nanostructured characteristics with the porous hollow structure and a relatively great surface area. As shown in Fig. S11,† we measured the CV and charge–discharge of the nickel foam to eliminate the influence of the base of the electrode. It was found that the capacitance at 1 A g−1 is only 25.0 F g−1. Compared with the capacitance value of NiCo2Se4 (1874.6 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), the contribution of the nickel foam is relatively low.

Fig. S12† shows N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore diameter distribution Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) data of NiCo2Se4 HMSs and NiCo2Se4 MFs. The adsorption–desorption isotherm plots reveal the typical IV isotherm, indicating the mesoporous structures.82 The specific surface area of NiCo2Se4 HMSs is 41.64 m2 g−1 with a pore size of 3.55 nm (Fig. S12a†). NiCo2Se4 MFs exhibit a specific surface area of 39.25 m2 g−1 with a pore size of 3.56 nm (Fig. S12b†). In addition, the pore volume of NiCo2Se4 HMSs (0.018 cm3 g−1) is higher than that of NiCo2Se4 MFs (0.012 cm3 g−1). The higher specific surface area and pore volume of NiCo2Se4 HMSs with abundant mesoporous structures can not only greatly increase the contact area between the electrolyte and the electrode, but also provide rich active sites to enhance electrochemical performance.83,84
Furthermore, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique is used to further understand the superior electrochemical behaviors of the NiCo2Se4 HMSs electrode. As shown in Fig. S13a,† the relevant equivalent circuit comprises the internal resistance (Rs), charge-transfer resistance (Rct), Warburg resistance (W), and the capacitance (Q).85 The Rct and Rs values of the NiCo2Se4 HMS electrode are 0.48 Ω and 0.91 Ω, respectively, whereas those for the NiCo2Se4 MF electrode are 2.22 Ω and 0.72 Ω, respectively. Meanwhile, the slope of the NiCo2Se4 HMS electrode is much higher than that of the NiCo2Se4 MF electrode. Remarkably, the above-mentioned results indicate that the NiCo2Se4 HMS electrode shows lower charge-transfer resistance and higher ionic conductivity, though the NiCo2Se4 HMS electrode shows a slightly high internal resistance (Rs), which may be due to the painting electrode material. The superior electrochemical performance of the NiCo2Se4 HMS electrode to others, as reported in Table S1,† may be because: (i) the existence of selenium in the NiCo2Se4 structure can effectively enhance its electric conductivity and structural stability,52 (ii) the favorable micro-/nanostructured characteristics with the porous hollow structure can increase the surface area and pore volume, and then provide more electroactive sites to store energy, and (iii) meanwhile, the mesoporous/hollow space from the microspheres could be used as the helpful ion buffering reservoir for effectively reducing the diffusion path to the internal structure, and increasing the reaction kinetics to obtain outstanding electrochemical performance. Long-time cycle life is an important factor for high-performance practical applications. Therefore, we evaluate the cycling stability of NiCo2Se4 HMSs and NiCo2Se4 MF electrodes. As shown in Fig. S13b,† the NiCo2Se4 HMS electrode retains 89.4% of its initial capacitance at 5 A g−1 after 5000 cycles, while that for NiCo2Se4 MF electrode is only 51.3%, indicating that the NiCo2Se4 HMS electrode has better cycling stability than that of the NiCo2Se4 MF electrode.
The BiSe HMS electrode is used as a negative electrode to fabricate asymmetric supercapacitors. A series of electrochemical measurements for the BiSe HMS electrode are also exhibited in Fig. 4 and supporting information. The CV curves of the BiSe HMS electrode (Fig. 4d) are similar to the reported Bi2O3 electrode. A pair of remarkable peaks indicate pseudocapacitive characteristics due to Bi0/Bi2+/Bi3+.86 In addition, a small peak at −0.55 to −0.44 V in CV curves may be ascribed to the oxidation of some untransformed bismuth in the process.58 The GCD curves with different current densities deliver a relatively wide discharge plateau at −0.6 V (Fig. 4e), also certifying the pseudocapacitive behavior. The specific capacitances of BiSe HMSs electrode were calculated to be 1292.8, 1184, 1155.3, 1064.3, 1026, 917.9, 860.2 and 809.8 F g−1 at 1, 2, 5, 8, 10, 20, 30 and 40 A g−1, respectively. The relevant electrochemical measurements of BiSe NPs (without glucose) were conducted to demonstrate that the BiSe HMS electrode possesses better electrochemical performance, as shown in ESI.† The CV curves at different scan rates and GCD curves at different current densities are represented in Fig. S14.† The BiSe HMS electrode shows a larger CV area and higher current density than those of BiSe NPs, exhibiting better specific capacitance (1292.8 F g−1) and rate capability (62.6%), than those of the BiSe NP electrode (867.7 F g−1, 60.3%), as shown in Fig. 4f.
The specific surface area and pore size distribution of BiSe HMSs and BiSe NPs are characterized by N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms shown in Fig. S15.† The plots with an obvious type IV hysteresis loop in the relative pressure range of 0.5–1.0 P/P0 indicate the presence of mesopores.16,87 As shown in Fig. S15a,† BiSe HMSs possess a specific surface area of 16.56 m2 g−1, which is much larger than that of BiSe NPs (10.82 m2 g−1) (Fig. S15b†). The inset shows that the two materials have a similar pore size of around 3.42 nm. However, the pore volume of BiSe HMSs (0.0088 cm3 g−1) is higher than that of BiSe NPs (0.0052 cm3 g−1). The appropriate mesoporous structure and higher specific surface area could enormously promote rapid ion transport and boost the redox reactions of BiSe HMSs in the electrolyte, which further enhance the energy storage performance.88
The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were carried out to further investigate why the BiSe HMS electrode delivers excellent electrochemical performance from the kinetics view. As exhibited in Fig. S16a,† the inset is the equivalent circuit for the fitting results.89,90 In the high-frequency region, the low Rct and Rs values of the BiSe HMS electrode (0.19 Ω, 0.77 Ω) indicate low intrinsic resistance and fast charge/electron transfer compared to the BiSe NP electrode (0.27 Ω, 0.80 Ω). In the low-frequency region, the larger slope of the straight for the BiSe HMS electrode proves a higher electric conductivity than that of the BiSe NPs electrode. These facts demonstrate that the BiSe HMS electrode has strong kinetics reactions. The excellent electrochemical performance of the BiSe HMS electrode compared with the other studies exhibited in Table S2† may be due to (i) the presence of selenium that tremendously enhances the electrical conductivity and stability for BiSe,52 (ii) the larger cavity structure beneficial for the contact between the electrolyte and the electrode material for carrying out rich redox reactions. We also evaluated the cycling stability of BiSe HMS and BiSe NP electrodes (Fig. S16b†). Remarkably, the BiSe HMS electrode exhibits excellent cycle performance (79.3%) at 5 A g−1 after 3000 cycles, whereas the BiSe NP electrode only retains 66.5% of its initial specific capacitance, which further proves the superiority of porous hollow BiSe HMSs. The electrochemical properties of the precursors (NiCo2O4 and Bi2O3) are also studied and discussed in the ESI† (Fig. S17 and S18).
We further analyze the total capacitance of NiCo2Se4 HMSs or BiSe HMSs electrodes divided into two charge storage contributions: diffusion-controlled process and surface capacitive process. The CV results at different scan rates are exhibited in Fig. 4a and d. The relationship between the peak current (i) and the scan rate (v) is as follows: i = avb. It can be rearranged as follows: logi = blogv + loga, where a and b are adjustable values. As we all know, if the b value is close to 0.5, the electrochemical reaction belongs to a diffusion-controlled process. If the b value approaches 1.0, the capacitive process will dominate.90,91 The corresponding b values of peaks 1 and 2 for the NiCo2Se4 HMS electrode are 0.551 and 0.553, respectively (Fig. S19a†), which indicates that the pseudocapacitance plays a major role in the capacitance contribution. Particularly, the capacitance contribution of the capacitive process and diffusion-controlled process were calculated using the formula: i = k1v + k2v1/2. It can be rearranged as follows: i/v1/2 = k1v1/2 + k2. As can be seen from Fig. S19b,†k1 and k2 are 0.46 and 10, respectively. Fig. S19c† shows the contribution of capacitance. The diffusion-controlled contribution to the total contribution is 90.7%, 87.2%, 82.9%, 80.2%, 77.4% and 73.7% at scan rates of 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 60 mV s−1, respectively. With the increase in scan rate, the contribution of the diffusion-controlled process partly decreases due to the limited diffusion of ions.92 Similarly, the b values of peaks 1 and 2 for the BiSe HMS electrode are 0.541 and 0.540, respectively (Fig. S19d†). k1 and k2 are 0.42 and 9.22, respectively (Fig. S19e†). Fig. S19f† shows that the contribution of diffusion-controlled process contributes 95.6%, 93.9%, 90.7%, 88.5%, 87.3%, 85% and 83% of the total capacitance, corresponding to the scan rates of 1, 2, 5, 8, 10, 15 and 20 mV s−1, respectively.
3.3. Electrochemical properties of the assembled NiCo2Se4 HMSs//BiSe HMSs asymmetric supercapacitors
On the basis of the outstanding electrochemical performance of NiCo2Se4 HMSs and BiSe HMSs electrodes, NiCo2Se4 HMSs//BiSe HMSs asymmetric supercapacitors were fabricated by NiCo2Se4 HMSs as a positive electrode and BiSe as a negative electrode with 3 M KOH electrolyte. The operating voltage windows of NiCo2Se4 HMS and BiSe HMS electrodes are −0.2–0.8 V and −1.0–0.0 V (Fig. S20†), respectively. Theoretically, the operating voltage of the asymmetric supercapacitors can be calculated to be 1.8 V by working potential complementary. In order to further ensure the actual operating voltage of the ASC device, the CV tests at different operating voltages ranging from 1.6 to 2.0 V were carried out, as shown in Fig. 5a. It is obvious that the CV curve shows polarization when the working voltage reaches 1.9 V. Therefore, we chose 1.8 V as the working voltage. The CV curves at different scan rates are displayed in Fig. 5b. The obvious redox peaks indicate the faraday characteristic of the device. Impressively, the shape of the CV curves has not changed significantly, even up to 70 mV s−1, which indicates superior rate capability of the device. The GCD measurements under different current densities ranging from 2 to 10 A g−1 were performed (Fig. 5c). The wider discharge platform further proves the faraday behavior, and every charging and discharging curve obtained is symmetric in nature, which manifests good reversibility in redox reactions. The specific capacitance values calculated by GCD curves (Fig. 5c) are presented in Fig. 5d. The calculated specific capacitance values of the NiCo2Se4 HMSs//BiSe HMSs asymmetric supercapacitors are 171.5 and 140.5 F g−1 at 2 and 10 A g−1, respectively, and the capacitance retention is 81.9%, showing good rate performance. Ragone plots are represented in Fig. 5e. The asymmetric supercapacitor achieves a maximum energy density of 76.73 W h kg−1 at a power density of 1.79 kW kg−1, and the energy density maintains at 63.2 W h kg−1 even at high power density of 9.0 kW kg−1. Furthermore, the energy densities are comparable or even superior to other previously reported studies in the literature such as CeO2/NiV-LDH//Bi2O3 (62.5 W h kg−1, 1.59 kW kg−1),93 Ni/Co-MOF//Bi2O3(47 W h kg−1, 1.125 kW kg−1),94 CoNi2S4//Bi2O3 (86.6 W h kg−.6 kW kg−1),58 (Ni,Co)Se2//BiSe (34.4 W h kg−1, 0.373 kW kg−1 and 25 W h kg−1, 2.1 kW kg−1)70 and NiCo2Se4//AC (25 W h kg−1, 0.49 kW kg−1 and 11.7 W h kg−1, 8.6 kW kg−1).80 More importantly, the specific capacitance retains about 93.4% after 3000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g−1 (Fig. 5f), manifesting excellent cyclic performance of the NiCo2Se4 HMSs//BiSe HMSs asymmetric supercapacitor. The coulombic efficiency possesses 97.8% in the first cycle and reaches nearly 100% in the subsequent cycles (Fig. 5f).

In addition, in order to demonstrate that the NiCo2Se4 HMSs//BiSe HMS asymmetric supercapacitors are expected to be used in practice, we connect the two asymmetric supercapacitors in series and light 35 light-emitting diodes (LEDs) arranged in parallel (Fig. 6a). Fig. 6b and c show the top- and front-view photos of lighting a red LED. In detail, the two devices can continuously light a red LED for more than 20 min (Fig. 6d–i), which further proves the superior capacity and stability of NiCo2Se4 HMSs//BiSe HMS asymmetric supercapacitors. Meanwhile, these remarkable results manifest that the NiCo2Se4 HMS and BiSe HMS electrode materials can be applied in high-performance asymmetric supercapacitors.

4. Conclusions
In this work, we have successfully synthesized NiCo2Se4 HMSs and BiSe HMSs following a facile self-template and selenide strategy. The fabricated microstructure showed porous hollow morphology, providing large surface area and more active sites for faradaic redox reactions, resulting in the outstanding specific capacitance, high rate capability and long cycling performance, respectively. The as-prepared positive electrode delivers a high specific capacitance of 262.0 mA h g−1 (1874.6 F g−1) at 1 A g−1 and good rate capability (74.9% capacitance retention at 20 A g−1). Meanwhile, the as-prepared negative electrode possesses an amazing capacitance of 360 mA h g−1 (1293 F g−1) at 1 A g−1 and excellent rate capability (62.6% capacitance retention at 40 A g−1). More significantly, the assembled NiCo2Se4 HMSs//BiSe HMSs asymmetric supercapacitors not only exhibit maximum energy density of up to 76.73 W h kg−1 at 1.79 kW kg−1, but also a long cycle performance with 93.4% capacitance retention after 3000 cycles. The encouraging results of the low-cost and high capacity NiCo2Se4 HMSs or BiSe HMSs demonstrate their great potential for commercial applications in electrochemical energy storage devices.
