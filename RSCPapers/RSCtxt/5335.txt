Herein, we propose an interfacial engineering strategy to passivate the surface defects of WBG perovskite films by employing 1,3-thiazolidine hydrochloride (ThHCl). The ThHCl treatment improves the carrier lifetime of the WBG perovskite absorber, decreases the defect density, and lowers the dark saturation current density of the device, leading to decreased nonradiative recombination. As a result, compared with the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.08 V for the control device, the device with ThHCl treatment delivers an improved VOC of 1.17 V, corresponding to a VOC deficit of 510 mV. Finally, a champion efficiency of 20.02% is achieved for the ThHCl-treated device with decent stability. The corresponding semitransparent device shows good near-infrared transmittance, beneficial to the construction of perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells. Our results demonstrate that thiazolidine-based interfacial engineering is a promising approach for achieving efficient and stable WBG PSCs.
Introduction
Single-junction perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.8% from the initial 3.8%, approaching the theoretical Shockley–Queisser (S–Q) efficiency limit.1–3 To break the S–Q limit, constructing perovskite-based tandem solar cells (TSCs), such as perovskite-silicon (Si),4,5 perovskite-copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS),6 and perovskite-perovskite TSCs,7 is the most effective strategy to further improve the PCE of solar cells. In particular, perovskite-Si TSCs, consisting of wide-bandgap (WBG) perovskite top cells with a bandgap of 1.65–1.70 eV and Si bottom cells, have realized a remarkable certified PCE of 33.2%,2 which shows great potential to develop perovskite-Si TSCs.
However, bromine (Br)-rich WBG (1.65–1.70 eV) PSCs, as a vital component of perovskite-Si TSCs, have larger open-circuit voltage (VOC) deficits (defined as Eg/q − VOC, where Eg is the bandgap of the perovskite absorber, and q is the elementary charge), compared with normal-bandgap (∼1.50–1.60 eV) PSCs, which restricts the further PCE improvement of perovskite-Si TSCs. As is well-known, WBG perovskites usually possess faster crystallization during the preparation process, leading to more defects in the bulk and on the surface.8,9 These defects, such as iodine (I) vacancies and uncoordinated lead/halide ions, could act as nonradiative recombination centers and capture the photogenerated carriers, resulting in a shortened carrier lifetime and thus deteriorating the device performance, including the VOC of WBG PSCs.10,11 In addition, photoinduced I–Br phase segregation and inappropriate energy levels between the WBG perovskite and charge transport layer also affect the VOC of WBG PSCs.12 Recently, interfacial nonradiative recombination has been considered to dominate the VOC losses of WBG PSCs, as revealed by previous reports.10,13 Therefore, improving the quality of WBG perovskites and eliminating the interfacial nonradiative recombination are critical to reduce the VOC deficits and improve the PCE of WBG PSCs.
Many strategies, such as additive engineering,14 compositional engineering,15 and interfacial engineering,16 have been developed to promote the film quality of WBG perovskites and mitigate the interfacial nonradiative recombination, which can dramatically improve the device performance, especially VOC. Yang et al. employed a trimethylphenylammonium tribromide additive to inhibit the iodide interstitial formation and reduce the charge recombination in 1.65 eV WBG perovskite films, contributing to a small VOC deficit of 400 mV and a high fill factor (FF) of 83%. The addition of tribromide also suppressed the phase segregation of WBG perovskites and improved the operational stability of WBG PSCs.17 As reported, charge transport layers can induce significant nonradiative interfacial recombination in Br-rich perovskites.10 An ultrathin MgFx layer was embedded between the perovskite layer and C60 to favorably modulate the surface energy of the perovskite layer, which facilitated efficient electron extraction and mitigated nonradiative recombination, leading to a certified stabilized PCE of 29.3% for a 1 cm2 monolithic perovskite-Si TSC.18 Despite great success, more efforts are needed to gradually approach the S–Q limit for WBG PSCs.
In this work, we propose an interfacial engineering strategy by treating the WBG perovskite surface with an organic halide salt, 1,3-thiazolidine hydrochloride (ThHCl), to achieve highly efficient and stable inverted WBG PSCs, based on a FA0.8Cs0.2Pb(I0.8Br0.2)3 perovskite absorber with a bandgap of 1.68 eV. The sulfur atom from the ThH+ ion not only possesses strong polarity, which improves the charge mobility, but also forms strong interactions with Pb2+ to passivate uncoordinated and undercoordinated Pb2+ defects.19–21 Meanwhile, the ammonium group from the ThH+ ion can also interact with the FA+ ion to immobilize FA+ or passivate the FA vacancies.22 It is found that ThHCl treatment on the surface of WBG perovskite film can prolong the carrier lifetime, reduce the density of defect states, and decrease the dark saturation current density. Finally, the VOC of the ThHCl-treated champion device is substantially increased to 1.17 V, compared with that (1.08 V) of the control device, corresponding to a VOC deficit of 510 mV. The opaque WBG PSC with ThHCl treatment eventually achieves a champion PCE of 20.02%, higher than that of 17.98% of the control device. The semitransparent device with ThHCl treatment delivers a PCE of 16.7%, showing good near-infrared transmittance, and can be applied as a top cell in perovskite-Si TSCs. Our work provides an effective interfacial passivation method to improve the performance of WBG PSCs and perovskite-based TSCs.
Results and discussion
To decrease the surface defects of the WBG perovskite films, we employed ThHCl salt (Fig. S1a, ESI†) to modify the surface of the WBG perovskite film. We first explored the effects of ThHCl treatment on the morphology of the WBG perovskite films, and the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images are shown in Fig. 1a and b. Unless stated otherwise, the solution concentration of ThHCl treatment is 2 mg mL−1. As we can see in Fig. 1a, there are some particles located at the grain boundaries, which could be excess lead halide (referred to as PbI2), as confirmed by the reported literature.9,23 However, the particles disappear after ThHCl treatment on the surface of the WBG perovskite film (Fig. 1b) and there is no significant difference in grain size. It is speculated that PbI2 can interact or react with ThHCl molecules to passivate the defects on the surface. Furthermore, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of WBG perovskite films with and without ThHCl treatment were measured to investigate the formation of low-dimensional perovskites. As shown in Fig. 1c, the intensity of the PbI2 peak at 12.6° decreases after ThHCl treatment, but no new peak appears at low angles, which indicates that no low-dimensional perovskite phase is produced and the decrease in the PbI2 peak intensity is attributed to the interaction between the PbI2 and ThHCl molecule.

In order to reveal the underlying mechanism of the interaction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement of the WBG perovskite films with and without ThHCl treatment was performed in Fig. 1d. As exhibited in Fig. 1e, the peak position of Pb 4f shifts towards lower binding energy after ThHCl treatment, implying that sulfur atoms from the ThH+ ion can interact with Pb2+, which passivates positively charged defects, such as halogen vacancies.19,21,24 Meanwhile, the N 1s peak of the ThHCl-treated WBG perovskite film also shifts compared with that of the control film, which is possibly ascribed to the formation of a hydrogen bond between the amino group from the ThH+ ion and the formamidine (FA+) ion from the WBG perovskite, preventing the formation of FA+ vacancies.25,26 The electrostatic potential distribution of ThH+ in Fig. S1b confirms the possibility of the interaction with the WBG perovskite due to the strong polarity. Therefore, these results verify that ThHCl treatment can passivate the defect states via interaction with the WBG perovskite.
To explore the effect of ThHCl treatment on the film quality of the WBG perovskites, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were measured. Fig. 2a shows the steady-state PL spectra of WBG perovskite films with and without ThHCl treatment. As we can see, the perovskite film with ThHCl treatment has a higher PL intensity at 738 nm than the control film, which indicates that ThHCl treatment can effectively decrease the density of defect states and thus reduce the nonradiative recombination losses. Fig. 2b and Table 1 show the TRPL spectra and corresponding fitting results, respectively, to obtain the carrier lifetimes. The results are fitted with a biexponential decay function, and the average carrier lifetime is up to 505.46 ns for the ThHCl-treated perovskite film, longer than that of 342.53 ns for the control film, indicating that the defects in the ThHCl-treated perovskite films were largely passivated.27 This excellent passivation effect can be visualized by PL mapping measurements as shown in Fig. 2c and d. The perovskite film with ThHCl treatment exhibits more uniform and higher PL intensity distribution than the control film, which is consistent with the PL and TRPL results in Fig. 2a and b, evidencing the improved film quality of the WBG perovskites after ThHCl treatment.

To investigate the effect of ThHCl treatment on the photovoltaic performance of the WBG PSCs, a series of WBG PSCs with a device structure of ITO/PTAA/FA0.8Cs0.2Pb(I0.8Br0.2)3/C60/BCP/Cu (Fig. 3a) were fabricated based on different concentrations of ThHCl solution. Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows the typical J–V characteristics of the WBG PSCs treated with different concentrations of ThHCl solution. Combined with the statistical results of the device performance parameters in Fig. S3 and Table S1 (ESI†), it can be seen that the average PCE monotonically increases from 17.37% to 19.43% when the concentration of the ThHCl solution increases from 0 to 2 mg mL−1. The VOC and FF keep the same trend as the PCE, mainly originating from the passivation effect with ThHCl treatment. The champion efficiency of 20.02% is obtained when the concentration is 2 mg mL−1. However, the PCE drops dramatically when the concentration increases up to 3 mg mL−1, which indicates that a thick ThHCl layer impedes the charge transport and thus lowers the JSC and FF.

We then compared the J–V curves of the best-performing WBG PSCs with (2 mg mL−1) and without ThHCl treatment under different voltage scans in Fig. 3b and Table 2. A champion PCE of 20.02% (19.85%) of the device with ThHCl treatment under reverse (forward) scan was obtained, corresponding to a VOC of 1.17 (1.15) V, a JSC of 21.27 (21.38) mA cm−2, and a FF of 80.48% (80.56%). For the control device, a PCE of 17.98% (17.56%) with a VOC of 1.08 (1.05) V, a JSC of 20.79 (20.72) mA cm−2, and a FF of 79.95% (80.29%) under the reverse (forward) scan was achieved. Both devices exhibit negligible hysteresis behavior. The statistical histograms of VOC and PCE have been plotted shown in Fig. 3c and d, demonstrating that ThHCl treatment can effectively suppress the nonradiative recombination and thus facilitate the VOC and PCE improvement. The integrated JSC values obtained from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra shown in Fig. 3e for the devices without and with ThHCl treatment are 19.75 mA cm−2 and 19.78 mA cm−2, respectively, which match well with the JSC values from the J–V curves. It is worth noting that the EQE spectrum of the device with ThHCl treatment shows a slight blue shift compared with the control device, indicating a slight increase in the bandgap, which is consistent with the change of the bandgap deduced from the Tauc plots of the WBG perovskite films with and without ThHCl treatment (Fig. S4, ESI†). Meanwhile, the EQE improvement in the range of 300–400 nm may originate from the slight penetration of ThH+ through the bulk to the buried interface, which has been revealed by a previous report.28 Fig. 3f shows the corresponding steady-state efficiencies of 20.02% and 18.3% for the device with ThHCl treatment and the control device, respectively.

We then conducted light intensity-dependent J–V measurements to examine the nonradiative recombination and charge transport behavior for the devices with and without ThHCl treatment. As shown in Fig. 4a, the monotonic relationship between light intensity and VOC is fitted by the following formula:  where n is the ideal factor, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, q is the elementary charge and Φlight is the light intensity. The device with ThHCl treatment has a smaller n value of 1.26 than that of 1.51 for the control device, which implies that ThHCl treatment effectively inhibits the trap-assisted Shockley-Read-Hall recombination.29,30 Similarly, the dependence of the JSC on light intensity (JSC ∝ Iα) is also linearly fitted, where I and α are the light intensity and exponential factor, respectively. Both α values of 0.9995 and 0.9971 for the control device and the device with ThHCl treatment, respectively, are close to 1, showing smooth charge transport with no accumulated free carriers.

Hole-only devices were fabricated to quantitatively calculate the trap state density by space-charge limited current (SCLC), as shown in Fig. 4c. The device with ThHCl treatment possesses a trap-filled limited voltage (VTFL) of 0.528 V, lower than that of 0.660 V for the control device. Therefore, the derived hole trap state density of the devices with and without ThHCl treatment is 1.07 × 1016 cm−3 and 1.34 × 1016 cm−3, respectively,31 indicating that ThHCl treatment is conducive to the passivation of trap states and the suppression of non-radiative recombination caused by deep-level defects, which increases the carrier lifetime and thus improves the VOC.32 Mott-Schottky analysis was measured to estimate the built-in potential (Vbi) at a frequency of 1 kHz in the dark. The relationship among the relevant physical quantities can be given by the following equation:  where A is the active area, C is the capacitance of the device, V is the applied bias, and N is the doping density. The Vbi can be obtained by fitting the C−2–V curve as shown in Fig. 4d. The Vbi of the device with ThHCl treatment is 0.904 V, which is higher than that of the control device, which is 0.817 V, indicating better junction quality and resultant VOC improvement.
Electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) measurement is often adopted to investigate the interfacial charge transport and recombination behavior. It can be seen from the Nyquist plots shown in Fig. 4e that the device with ThHCl treatment has a larger radius than the control device, which indicates the larger recombination resistance (Rrec), demonstrating suppressed nonradiative recombination. However, the series resistance (Rs) of the device with ThHCl treatment is comparable with that of the control one, which indicates that the charge transfer of the device has not been affected by ThHCl treatment.33,34 J0 can be derived by fitting the dark J–V curve (Fig. 4f and Fig. S5, ESI†), and the J0 of the ThHCl-treated device decreases from 4.63 × 10−5 to 1.18 × 10−5 mA cm−2, in accordance with the EIS results, which improves the photovoltaic performance of the WBG PSCs.35 The device with ThHCl treatment retains over 98% of the initial efficiency after being stored in a glovebox for more than 300 h without encapsulation (Fig. S6, ESI†).
Finally, we fabricated a semitransparent WBG PSC, the J–V curve and corresponding EQE spectrum of which are shown in Fig. S7 and S8 (ESI†). The device provides a PCE of 16.77% (16.38%) under reverse (forward) scan, with a VOC of 1.13 (1.12) V, a JSC of 18.59 (18.50) mA cm−2, and a FF of 79.64% (78.63%). The efficiency gap with the opaque device may be due to the damage of the WBG perovskite layer caused by the sputtering of the transparent ITO electrode. Further optimizations regarding the sputtering of the transparent electrode and the compactness of the buffer layer SnO2 need to be done to improve the device performance, especially the FF. Meanwhile, the exploitation of new hole transport materials, such as self-assembled monolayers, and passivation of the buried interface could largely improve the VOC of the device. Therefore, the device performance of both opaque and semitransparent WBG devices will be enhanced. The transmittance spectra of the semitransparent WBG PSC with ThHCl treatment in Fig. S9 (ESI†) shows good near-infrared transmittance in the range of 750–1100 nm, which demonstrates the potential application of WBG PSCs in this work to fabricate highly efficient perovskite-Si TSCs.
Conclusion
In summary, we have demonstrated an interfacial treatment strategy with a new organic halide salt ThHCl, and systematically investigated the effect of ThHCl treatment on the device performance of WBG PSCs. Characterization results proved that ThHCl treatment could effectively passivate the surface defects of WBG perovskite films, prolong the carrier lifetime, and reduce the dark saturation current density. Therefore, a champion PCE of 20.02% with a reduced VOC deficit of 0.51 V was achieved for the ThHCl-treated WBG PSCs. And the semitransparent device showed good near-infrared transmittance. Our results suggest that thiazolidine-based interfacial engineering is an effective method to improve the VOC and thus achieve efficient and stable WBG PSCs.
