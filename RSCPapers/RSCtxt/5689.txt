    , Accepted 4th August 2017First published on 4th August 2017AbstractIn an effort to address the solvothermal control synthesis issues of hexagonal upconversion nanocrystals (UCNCs) without additional co-doping, especially for NaYbF4:Er, we find for the first time that the mostly used sodium sources of NaOH and sodium oleate function through a totally unexpected NaF–HF pathway rather than the commonly accepted pathway of each of them. Specifically, NaOH reacts with NH4F and converts to nano-sized NaF completely in methanol, leading to reduced NH4F decomposition/HF generation in NaOH based synthesis. By contrast, sodium oleate-oleic acid hybrid suppresses NaF generation, leading to enhanced NH4F decomposition/HF generation in sodium oleate based synthesis. HF-flask SiO2 reaction, HF-to-NaF etching and HF tail gas were also detected for the first time. Results show the nano-sized NaF and in situ generated HF play key roles in the formation of cubic monomers and the cubic-to-hexagonal transition of UCNCs, respectively. Inspired by these results, a facile binary sodium strategy was proposed to achieve control synthesis of high-quality and small-sized hexagonal UCNCs via simultaneous regulation of nano-sized NaF and HF levels. HF was also verified as an origin of Ostwald ripening for UCNCs. The impacts of Ostwald ripening on the evolution of UCNCs were thus investigated. Our findings not only offer an advanced growth mechanism, but also present an effective control synthesis tool for UCNCs.
1. Introduction
The multifunctional nature of rare-earth (RE3+) based upconversion nanocrystals (UCNCs) due to their unique optical, magnetic and X-ray absorption characteristics gives them wide application in bio-imaging, bio-sensing, photodynamic therapy, solar cells, volumetric displays, solid-state lasers, optical data storage, etc.1–3 Control synthesis, closely associated with nanocrystal size, shape, upconversion efficiency, versatility, spectrum tailing, etc., is an inevitable focus in developing UCNCs.4–10 The user-friendly solvothermal strategy is one of the commonly used control synthesis methods for achieving high upconversion efficiency favorable for sodium rare-earth tetrafluoride (NaYF4, NaGdF4 and NaLuF4) based hexagonal phase (β-) UCNCs.11–21 Size-tunable synthesis of uniform β-UCNCs in the range of ∼10 nm to ∼25 nm, which are preferred for bio-applications, is useful to satisfy various nanocrystal size requirements. Additional co-doping (e.g., Gd3+), regulation of oleic acid (HOA)-to-precursor ratio and heating rate are the main protocols available for solvothermal size-tunable synthesis.16,22,23
NaYbF4 is another attractive sodium rare-earth tetrafluoride, which can serve as both promising upconversion host material and computed tomography contrast agent.1 Additional co-doping was the main approach for NaOH based solvothermal control synthesis of β-NaYbF4.24,25 Gd3+ doping not only supplied an efficient size-tunable approach but also rendered the magnetic resonance imaging contrast effect for β-NaYbF4 based UCNCs. However, there are still longstanding issues in the solvothermal size-tunable synthesis of β-NaYbF4:Er without additional co-doping. Wang and coworkers attributed this to rapid growth characteristics of β-NaYbF4.26 The available NaYbF4 based UCNCs are mainly based on the cubic (α-) phase,27–29 but β-UCNCs may supply more optimal upconversion efficiency. Lacking a strategy for preparing β-NaYbF4 based UCNCs without additional co-doping led to difficulties in direct investigations of their intrinsic optical properties.26
Until now, several groups have pioneered solvothermal control synthesis of small-sized β-NaYbF4 without additional co-doping. Qin and co-workers achieved β-NaYbF4:Tm (∼9 nm) by using oleylamine/solid sodium oleate (NaOA)/NH4F at 320 °C.30 Size distribution of β-NaYbF4:Tm was slightly broad in their work. Tian et al. prepared β-NaYbF4:Er (∼21.7 nm) by using rare-earth oleate (RE(OA)3) and sodium source of NaF, but this strategy needed tedious preparation procedures for RE(OA)3.31 The diameter of β-NaYbF4:Tm was still as big as ∼40 nm by using RE(OA)3/solid NaOH/NH4F.32 It is, therefore, significant to develop a facile solvothermal control synthesis strategy for high-quality and small-sized β-NaYbF4 based UCNCs.
In this work, we firstly reveal the intrinsic functional pathway of the commonly used solvothermal sodium sources of NaOH and NaOA for UCNCs. Actually, NaOH transforms to nano-sized NaF (NSNaF) completely in methanol by reacting with NH4F before participating in the solvothermal reaction. NSNaF facilities the formation of α-phase UCNCs via retarding NH4F decomposition/HF generation in NaOH based solvothermal synthesis. By contrast, NaOA·HOA hybrid occurs in NaOA based solvothermal synthesis, which retards NaOA–NH4F reaction but facilitates NH4F decomposition/HF generation at elevated temperature. A series of experiments showed HF was responsible for the α-to-β transition of UCNCs. A facile binary sodium source (NaOH/NaOA) strategy is thus proposed to address the solvothermal control synthesis issues of β-NaYbF4:Er via simultaneous regulation of NSNaF and HF levels. The relevance between the HF level and Ostwald ripening, as well as the impacts of Ostwald ripening on the evolution of UCNCs are also presented.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Rare-earth acetate, oleic acid (HOA; technical grade, 90%), 1-octadecene (ODE; technical grade, 90%) and sodium oleate (NaOA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA). NH4F (AR, 98%), NaOH (98%), NaF (99.99%) and sodium acetate trihydrate (CH3COONa·3H2O; 99.5%) were obtained from Aladdin Industrial Corporation.
2.2. Synthesis and methods

The formation of NSNaF via NaOH–NH4F reaction in methanol. 
Methanol (6 mL) was added to a plastic centrifuge tube containing 1.5 mmol of NaOH and 2.4 mmol of NH4F, followed by ultrasonic-assisted dissolution for 10 min. NSNaF was formed in this normal NaOH–NH4F solution preparation step during solvothermal synthesis of UCNCs. The NSNaF was collected by centrifugation, washed with methanol and re-dispersed in 6 mL of methanol for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis and element mapping analysis.


Solvothermal synthesis of UCNCs by using sodium source of NaOH. 
The UCNCs were prepared according to the literature.13,33 Typically, 0.6 mmol of rare-earth acetates was added to HOA/ODE solution (3.6 mL/9 mL) in a 50 mL three-necked glass flask. The reaction system was heated at 160 °C for 30 min and then cooled down to 35 °C. NH4F (2.4 mmol) and NaOH (1.5 mmol) dissolved in methanol (6 mL) were added dropwise, followed by stirring at 35 °C for 30 min and increasing the reaction temperature to 100 °C to remove methanol. The system was then heated to 300 °C (∼20 °C min−1), reacted at this temperature for 1 h, and then cooled down. The products were purified and stored in cyclohexane.
Unless otherwise specified, the Na/RE/F ratio and high temperature reaction condition were kept constant (2.5:1:4, 300 °C, 60 min) in synthesis for reagent saving and high nanocrystal crystallinity.


Solvothermal synthesis of UCNCs by using sodium source of NaF. 
The procedures were similar to those for preparing UCNCs by using sodium source of NaOH except that 2.4 mmol of direct solid NaF, which was purchased from a commercial source, was used.


Solvothermal synthesis of UCNCs by using sodium source of NaOA. 
The UCNCs were prepared according to the literature.14 Typically, 0.6 mmol of rare-earth acetates was added to HOA/ODE solution (3.6 mL/9 mL). The reaction system was heated at 160 °C for 30 min and then cooled down to 35 °C. Subsequently, NaOA (1.5 mmol) was added, followed by stirring for 10 min. NH4F (2.4 mmol) dissolved in methanol (6 mL) was added dropwise followed by stirring for 30 min. Subsequent procedures were similar to those for preparing UCNCs by using sodium source of NaOH.


Heating NH4F in NaOA/HOA/ODE. 
A methanolic solution of NH4F (2.4 mmol) was added to NaOA/HOA/ODE solution (1.5 mmol/3.6 mL/9 mL) in a 50 mL three-necked glass flask, followed by stirring at 35 °C for 30 min, evaporating methanol at 50 °C under argon flow, collecting the precipitates through centrifugation, and washing with cyclohexane. High-temperature reactions were performed by elevating the system temperature to 150 °C, 200 °C or 300 °C after evaporating the methanol. Precipitate samples were collected similarly.


Heating NSNaF in HOA/ODE. 
A methanolic solution containing NaOH (1.5 mmol) and NH4F (2.4 mmol) was added to HOA/ODE (3.6 mL/9 mL), followed by stirring at 35 °C for 30 min, and evaporating the methanol at 50 °C under argon flow. The system was then heated to 300 °C, and then cooled down immediately. Precipitate samples were collected through centrifugation and washed with cyclohexane.


HF-glass flask SiO2 reaction during solvothermal synthesis. 
The solvothermal reactions were carried out in a three-necked glass flask. We find that NH4F will decompose to HF in solvothermal HOA/ODE system at high temperature. As is well known, there is abundant SiO2 in glass, and thus HF will react with glass flask SiO2 at high temperature (6HF + SiO2 = H2SiF6 + 2H2O). H2SiF6 will convert to Na2SiF6 in the presence of NaOA or convert to (NH4)2SiF6 in the absence of NaOA.


Solvothermal synthesis of UCNCs by adding NH4F ahead of NaOH (CH3COONa). 
The RE(OA)3 formation processes were the same as those for preparing UCNCs by using sodium source of NaOH. And then a methanolic solution of NH4F (2.4 mmol) was added at 35 °C, followed by stirring at 35 °C for 30 min, adding a methanolic solution of NaOH or CH3COONa (1.5 mmol) and stirring at 35 °C for another 30 min. Subsequent procedures were similar to those for preparing UCNCs by using the sodium source of NaOH.


Synthesis of UCNCs by using the proposed binary sodium source strategy. 
To simplify the influence of factors on nanocrystal nucleation and growth, in situ generated NaOA, instead of direct solid NaOA, was used to keep consistent the coordination process for rare-earth precursors and total amount of oleate anions (OA−) in the binary sodium source synthesis system. In a typical synthesis for NaYbF4:Er (2 mol%), 0.6 mmol of rare-earth acetates was added to HOA/ODE solution (3.6 mL/9 mL). The reaction system was heated at 160 °C for 30 min and then cooled down to 50 °C, and then 4 mL of methanol solution containing NaOH ((60 − x) mg, x = 0, 3, 4.5, 6 and 12) was injected. The reaction system was heated at 120 °C for 10 min for the in situ generation of NaOA, followed by degassing under vacuum for 2 min at 110 °C, and then cooling to room temperature. Subsequently, NH4F (2.4 mmol) and NaOH (x mg) dissolved in methanol (6 mL) were added dropwise, followed by stirring at 35 °C for 30 min. Subsequent procedures were similar to those for preparing UCNCs by using the sodium source of NaOH.


Measurements of NaF level in solvothermal system. 
The solvothermal reaction was stopped at predetermined conditions, cooled down, followed by collecting the precipitates through centrifugation, washing with cyclohexane and drying. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and TEM analysis showed most of the precipitates were NaF, which was insoluble in cyclohexane. The mass of the precipitates was defined as the NaF level of the solvothermal system.


Tail gas acidity monitoring. 
A pH indicator strip was located at the argon flow outlet of the solvothermal system for 10 seconds to measure the acidity of tail gas.


Synthesis of core/shell structured UCNCs by coating NaYF4 shell. 
The shell coating procedures were similar to those used in one of our previous studies.34 Typically, 3 mL of HOA, 7 mL of ODE, 0.4 mmol of core UCNCs and 0.3 mmol of shell stock solution were used in one shell growth process.

2.3. Characterization
Low-resolution TEM images were obtained by using an H-600 microscope (Hitachi, Japan). High-resolution TEM imaging, high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) imaging, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA) and element mapping were conducted with a Tecnai G2 F20 microscope (FEI, USA). XRD patterns of samples were collected by using a D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer (Bruker, Germany) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis was conducted with a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer. Upconversion luminescence spectra were measured with an RF-5301 spectrofluorometer (Shimadzu, Japan) under excitation of an external 980 nm laser source.
3. Results and discussion
In a typical NaOH based solvothermal synthesis for UCNCs, we found that the pH of a methanol solution (6 mL) containing 1.5 mmol of NaOH decreased sharply from ∼14 to ∼9 after adding 2.4 mmol of NH4F (Fig. 1A). This indicated an acid–base reaction occurred (NaOH + NH4F = NaF + NH4OH). Tyndall effect revealed a quasi-colloidal NaF solution might be formed (Fig. 1A). TEM and element mapping results confirmed NSNaF (∼400 nm), which was one order of magnitude smaller than direct solid NaF (Fig. 1Bvs.Fig. 1C, D–J and Table S1, ESI†), which was formed.

In order to confirm the NaOH–NH4F reaction and test the reaction extent, different amounts of NaOH were added to a series of methanolic solutions containing fixed amount of NH4F (2.4 mmol), followed by ultrasonic-assisted dissolution, collecting the precipitates through centrifugation, washing with methanol and drying. White powders were obtained, and their XRD patterns agreed well with that of pure NaF (JCPDS 36-1455), confirming the NaF generation reaction (Fig. 1K). Moreover, NaOH converted to NaF completely according to a stoichiometric ratio of 1:1 (Fig. 1L). NaOH had converted to NSNaF completely before participating in the solvothermal reaction.
As control experiments, no precipitates could be collected in methanol solution (6 mL) containing solely NaOH (1.5 mmol) or solely NH4F (2.4 mmol) by using the same precipitate collection procedures as for the above-mentioned NSNaF. Results showed both NaOH and NH4F could be dissolved in methanol, and NSNaF was the product of the NaOH–NH4F reaction.
The NaOH-to-NSNaF conversion and the impacts on the formation of UCNCs seemingly were overlooked in the past. The formation of NSNaF in a methanol solution of NaOH and NH4F has never been observed likely due to the fact that naked-eye observation of NSNaF is difficult since the quasi-colloidal solution is very transparent. NaOH/NH4F functioned through direct reactions between themselves and rare-earth precursors according to Zhang et al.13 NaOH was also regarded as only source of OA−.35 Our findings proved the intrinsic functional pathway of NaOH was NSNaF.
The size variation of NSNaF, caused by operational differences, corresponded to the nanocrystal size reproducibility issue in NaOH based synthesis (Fig. 1Bvs.Fig. 1B inset). The release of Na+ and F− from NaF is a key step for phase transfer (solid (NaF) → solution (HOA/ODE)) and nanocrystal formation when NaF was used as sodium source,36 while NaF is hard to dissolve in HOA/ODE. Size variation of NSNaF will surely provide different NaF consumption rate and resultant size variations of final UCNCs. These results supplied the intrinsic reason for the formation of smaller UCNCs by prolonging nucleation reported in the literature.23,37
To show the difference between the NSNaF and direct solid NaF, we selected the easily prepared NaYF4:Yb/Er and more difficultly prepared NaYbF4:Er as examples, and prepared them by conventional NaOH and NaF based solvothermal strategies.33,36 The former provided uniform β-NaYF4:Yb/Er (∼25 nm, JCPDS 16-0334) and polydisperse (α + β)-NaYbF4:Er (∼25 nm, JCPDS 77-2043 and 27-1427), and there was no residual NaF in final products after 60 min reaction at 300 °C (Fig. 2A, B and E(a, b)). In comparison, direct solid NaF gave respective non-uniform (α + β)-NaYF4:Yb/Er (JCPDS 77-2042 and 16-0334) and (α + β)-NaYbF4:Er, accompanied with considerable residual NaF in final products (Fig. 2C, D and E(c, d)). Results demonstrated that NSNaF, which had higher surface-to-volume ratio, prevailed over direct solid NaF in consumption rate. However, control synthesis of β-NaYbF4:Er was still difficult even by using NSNaF according to the conventional NaOH based solvothermal strategy likely due to the fact that NSNaF supplied excessive α-monomers and the α-monomers could not be dissolved to form β-NaYbF4:Er.
 Fig. 2  TEM images of UCNCs prepared by sodium sources of NaOH (A and B) and NaF (C and D). (E) XRD patterns (a–d) for the samples used in (A–D). 
Notably, direct solid NaF could provide β-NaYF4:Yb/Er by using RE(OA)3 precursors and higher NaF/RE ratio according to the solvothermal strategy.36 High NaF dissolution amount is the key to achieve fast crystallization speed and resultant control synthesis effect by using sodium source of NaF; accordingly, the nanocrystal size-tuning capacity of NaF is severely restricted by its low solubility in the weakly polar HOA–ODE solvothermal system. The diameter of β-NaYF4:Yb/Er was still as big as ∼18 nm by using very high NaF-to-RE ratio (>18).
Inspired by the finding of NSNaF, clues of NaF in NaOA based solvothermal system were explored to reveal if there was any unknown functional pathway of NaOA. NaOA is another well-known solvothermal sodium source for preparing ultra-small β-UCNCs.11,14 Strong binding capacity between OA− and RE3+ contributes much to the formation of UCNCs according to theoretical calculations and morphology of final products.35,38 However, there are still no direct experimental evidences to confirm such a functional pathway. At the very beginning, the reactivity between NaOA and NH4F in methanol was studied. NaOA was converted completely to even smaller-sized NaF by reacting with NH4F (Fig. 3A and Fig. S1 (ESI†); Fig. 3Bvs.Fig. 1B). When the NaOA–NH4F mixture was used to prepare UCNCs by using similar procedures to those used for the NaOH based strategy, uniform β-NaYF4:Yb/Er (∼19.6 nm ± 7.2%) but still polydisperse (α + β)-NaYbF4:Er were formed. The methanolic NaOA–NH4F showed a similar function to that of methanolic NaOH–NH4F in control synthesis (Fig. 3C, Dvs.Fig. 2A, B).

TEM images: (B) the product of NaOA–NH4F reaction in methanol; (C and D) NaYF4:Yb/Er and NaYbF4:Er prepared by using methanolic solution of NaOA–NH4F (300 °C, 45 min); (E and F) NaYF4:Yb/Er and NaYbF4:Er prepared by conventional NaOA strategy (Na/RE/F = 2.5:1:4, 300 °C, 60 min). Insets of (C, E and F): size histograms of corresponding samples calculated from 200 randomly selected nanocrystals, and the size of other samples was calculated similarly. 
As control experiments, we prepared UCNCs by adding NaOA ahead of NH4F according to conventional NaOA based strategy and classic experimental conditions. Sub-10 nm β-NaYF4:Yb/Er (9.5 nm ± 11.1%) and small-sized β-NaYbF4:Er (17.3 nm ± 20.0%) were obtained, showing NaOA provided higher α-to-β transition efficiency than NaOH in solvothermal synthesis of UCNCs (Fig. 3E and F). It is notable that OA−, existing in methanolic NaOA–NH4F, showed much inferior control synthesis effect than that in conventional NaOA strategy (Fig. 3C, Dvs.Fig. 3E, F). The literature theory of binding capacity between OA− and RE3+ for the α-to-β transition of UCNCs showed limitations in explaining this comparison.38 The functional pathway of NaOA in conventional NaOA based strategy differed from that in methanolic NaOA–NH4F, and OA− was not a sole motivation for the α-to-β transition of UCNCs. We should also note that the NaOA based strategy supplied small-sized but non-uniform β-NaYbF4:Er.
To achieve deeper insights into the functional pathway of NaOA in solvothermal synthesis, the reactivity between NaOA and NH4F in HOA/ODE was studied by heating NH4F in NaOA/HOA/ODE. NaOA could not convert to NaF at low temperature when a methanolic solution of NH4F was added to NaOA/HOA/ODE (Fig. 4A(a)). Since NaF generation was actually a simple acid–base reaction, it is believed that NaOA was shielded from acidic NH4F by acidic HOA. The shielding effect was confirmed by TEM analysis. We found NaOA–HOA assembled into small nanoparticles (dozens of nanometers) of NaOA·HOA hybrid (Fig. S2A, ESI†). The hybrid formation was also supported by our other finding in preparing NaLuF4:Yb/Er (Fig. S2B–D and S3, ESI†).
 Fig. 4  XRD patterns of the precipitates collected after heating NH4F in NaOA/HOA/ODE by using different conditions. 
In high-temperature NaOA/HOA/ODE, low ratio of NaOA-to-NaF conversion occurred; meanwhile, NH4F decomposed to HF. The precipitates were collected after heating NH4F in NaOA/HOA/ODE to predetermined temperature. NH4F and NaF could be observed in the precipitate collected by using 150 °C (Fig. 4A(b)); however, the precipitate collected by using 200 °C might consist of solely NaF (Fig. 4A(c)). Even if the precipitate collected by using 200 °C consisted of solely NaF, the NaOA-to-NaF conversion was still incomplete since only ∼50% of NaOA converted to NaF based on the mass of the collected precipitate (1.5 mmol NaOA → 31.4 mg NaF). Besides NaF, Na2SiF6 appeared in the precipitate (48.5 mg) collected by using 300 °C (Fig. 4B(a)), indicating the presence of high level of system HF and HF-glass flask SiO2 reaction. The HF should be generated via NH4F decomposition. As a control, a methanolic solution of NaOH–NH4F was added to HOA/ODE and heated at 300 °C for 0 min. The collected precipitate mainly consisted of NSNaF. By contrast, ∼92% of NSNaF existed based on the mass of the collected precipitate (1.5 mmol NSNaF → 58.2 mg precipitate), indicating less NH4F decomposed in NaOH based synthesis since it converted to NSNaF via NaOH–NH4F reaction.
The effects of NaOA amount and reaction time on NaOA–NH4F reaction in HOA/ODE confirmed the decomposition of NH4F and generation of HF (Fig. 4B). Both decreased NaOA amount and prolonged reaction time provided higher Na2SiF6 ratio in the NaF/Na2SiF6 precipitates, showing enhanced NH4F decomposition and HF–SiO2 reaction. Longer reaction time resulted in enhanced etching effect, suggesting most HF should be absorbed onto NaOA and stored in the system via hydrogen bonds, instead of complete volatilization. NSNaF along with many loose-hollow structured nanosheets of Na2SiF6 could be observed in TEM images (Fig. 5A and B). To show the Na2SiF6 formation process, NH4F alone was heated to 300 °C in HOA/ODE, pure (NH4)2SiF6 formed (Fig. 5C), also suggesting the occurrence of the HF–SiO2 reaction:6HF + SiO2 = H2SiF6 + 2H2O

Both the detected (NH4)2SiF6 and Na2SiF6 were thus generated from transformation of H2SiF6. The HF–SiO2 reaction supplied direct evidences for the presence of high level of system HF. Elemental analysis results confirmed the presence of silicon in a NaF/Na2SiF6 mixture (Fig. 5D–K). The Na/F ratio in the NaF/Na2SiF6 mixture was ∼0.7:1, which was much lower than that in NaF (1:1). A strong band corresponding to the Si–F bond at 736 cm−1 in the FTIR spectra also supported the generation of Na2SiF6 by the HF–SiO2 reaction (Fig. 5L). Results showed the NaOA-to-NaF reactivity was low, and thus abundant NH4F decomposed to HF due to the formation of NaOA·HOA hybrid in HOA/ODE.
We found the functional pathway of NaOA in actual solvothermal synthesis of UCNCs was similar to that of the above simulated HOA/ODE system. The NaF levels in actual solvothermal systems were measured to reflect the NaOA-to-NaF reactivity. NaF could not be detected even at 150 °C but was detected at 200 °C in NaOA based solvothermal synthesis of UCNCs (Fig. 6A and Fig. S4, S5, ESI†), suggesting low NaOA-to-NaF conversion reactivity. In contrast, there was still quite a lot of unconsumed NaF in NaOH based synthesis system at 150 °C, confirming low dissolution and consumption rates of NaF in the weakly polar system (Fig. 6A and Fig. S4, ESI†). Moreover, the in situ generated NaF still existed at 290 °C in NaOA based NaYbF4:Er synthesis, while NSNaF was consumed at 290 °C in NaOH based NaYbF4:Er synthesis, also supporting low NaOA-to-NaF conversion reactivity.
 Fig. 6  (A) NaF levels in actual NaOA and NaOH based solvothermal synthesis systems. (B) Monitoring of tail gas acidity. 
Low NaOA-to-NaF conversion reactivity also led to HF generation in actual solvothermal synthesis of UCNCs. The acidity of tail gases was monitored by a wetted pH indicator strip (pH ∼ 6). The tail gases of both NaOA and NaOH based systems were alkaline below 300 °C, while they turned acidic at 300 °C (Fig. 6B). By contrast, the tail gas acidity of NaF based system at 300 °C was much weaker (Fig. 6B). The detected alkaline gas below 300 °C should be NH3, which came from decomposition of NH4F or ammonium oleate. The acidic gas should be HF generated from NH4F decomposition. To confirm this supposition, we collected the acidic gas by a fresh methanolic solution of NaOH (collection time of 30 min) during NaOA based solvothermal synthesis of UCNCs. NaF was detected in such fresh NaOH solution (Fig. S6A, ESI†). So we reasoned that HF should also be enriched into waste methanol during synthesis. As expected, NaF was obtained by adding NaOH into waste methanol collected after about twenty times of NaOA based solvothermal UCNC synthesis (Fig. S6B, ESI†). Results showed the generation of HF via NH4F decomposition in NaOA and NaOH based solvothermal synthesis systems.
The HF level in the actual NaOA based solvothermal system was higher than that in the NaOH based one. Etching morphology of NaF supplied a direct index for evaluating the system HF level (Fig. 7). The NaF collected at 290 °C in NaOA based system was more uniform than that in NaOH based system, supporting that the former was in situ generated and the latter NSNaF was undergoing dissolution (Fig. 7Avs.Fig. 7C). The edges of in situ generated NaF at α-to-β transition period were thin and irregular, coinciding with that of common HF etching effects in NaOA based system (Fig. 7B). However, the etching of HF-to-NaF was much weaker at a similar period in NaOH based solvothermal system, indicating lower HF level (Fig. 7D). The system HF level differences were also supported by our designed HF-glass flask SiO2 reactions (Fig. S7, ESI†).

To summarize, there were original differences for Na+ and F− at α-to-β transition period between NaOA and NaOH based solvothermal systems. Besides NaREF4, NaOA·HOA and high level HF existed in the NaOA based system, but NaF and low level HF might represent the main morphology of sodium and fluoride sources in the NaOH based system. The NaOA based system with high level HF provided small-sized β-NaYbF4:Er, while a large amount of α-NaYbF4:Er could not be dissolved to form β-NaYbF4:Er in NaOH based low level HF system (Fig. 2Bvs.Fig. 3F). These comparisons suggested the system HF level was an important motivation for α-to-β transition of UCNCs due to the following reasoning.
(i) Lattice modulation and rearrangement of involved ions (RE3+, Na+, F−) are essential to realize the α-to-β transition and form thermodynamically stable β-UCNCs. The reactivity of involved ions contributed greatly to the α-to-β transition. (ii) High level of HF implied high NaOA·HOA level, and they could supply higher sodium and fluoride reactivity than those of inert NaF. (iii) Dissolution of α-monomers is also a key step for the α-to-β transition according to the Ostwald ripening mechanism.39 It is worth noting that high level of HF was etched into the in situ generated NaF as deep as ∼50 nm after only 10 min reaction at 300 °C (Fig. 7B), and thus it should have a strong dissolving capacity for unstable α-monomers.
The nanocrystal growth characteristics for different host materials supported the HF level hypothesis in α-to-β transition. We found that the binding capacity of Yb3+ was stronger than that of Y3+ (Fig. S8, ESI†), which agreed with shorter ionic radius of Yb3+ than Y3+. Dissolution of α-NaYbF4:Er was thus more difficult than that of α-NaYF4:Yb/Er, revealing the intrinsic reason for the consistently lower α-to-β transition efficiency and bigger diameter of NaYbF4:Er than those of NaYF4:Yb/Er according to the same strategy. Dissolving capacity of HF gave a reasonable explanation for higher α-to-β transition efficiency of UCNCs in NaOA based NaYbF4:Er synthesis than that in NaOH based NaYbF4:Er synthesis.
Delayed α-to-β transition and lower transition efficiency occurred when we performed NH4F–RE(OA)3 binding at 100 °C, instead of at 35 °C solely, under argon flow before adding a methanolic solution of NaOH (Fig. 8A, Bvs.Fig. 8C, D and Fig. S9, ESI†). Such phenomena should be due to partial removal of system HF by argon flow in the absence of alkaline NaOA, supporting the HF hypothesis.

(E–H) TEM images of UCNCs prepared by using sodium source of CH3COONa. Methanolic solution of NH4F–CH3COONa was used in preparing UCNCs for (E and G), while NH4F was added ahead of CH3COONa for (F and H). 
The growth characteristics of UCNCs by using the sodium source of CH3COONa, which has been scarcely used until now, also strongly supported the proposed HF level hypothesis. Through avoiding NaF generation and enhanced HF generation by performing NH4F–RE(OA)3 binding at 35 °C ahead of CH3COONa addition, much smaller-sized and more uniform β-NaYF4:Yb/Er and β-NaYbF4:Er were achieved in the absence of NaOA (Fig. 8Evs.Fig. 8F and Fig. 8Gvs.Fig. 8H), supporting the HF level hypothesis.
In summary, NaOA·HOA hybrid, instead of free NaOA, is the intrinsic functional pathway of NaOA. The hybrid led to low NaOA-to-NaF conversion reactivity and resultant high level of system HF. HF was verified as an intrinsic motivation for the fast α-to-β transition of UCNCs in NaOA based synthesis. The HF levels and their effects on solvothermal nanocrystal growth seemingly had been also neglected in the past. In a pioneering solvothermal work for the preparation of UCNCs, Zhang and co-workers reported that there was no HF in the NaOH based solvothermal system.13 Our finding of HF supplied a key theoretical supplement for such pioneering work.
In view of the respective functions of NSNaF and HF in achieving sacrificial α-monomers and α-to-β transition, a binary sodium source (NaOH/NaOA) might supply a facile and effective strategy to address the control synthesis issues of β-NaYbF4:Er (Scheme 1). Replacing most NaOH by NaOA was designed to supply high α-to-β transition efficiency. A small amount of NaOH was used to regulate α-monomer amount and achieve nanocrystal size-tunability.
 Scheme 1  Schematic diagram of the binary sodium source strategy. 
Encouragingly, the binary sodium strategy showed sensitive nanocrystal size tuning and focusing effect for NaYbF4:Er. The average diameters were tuned from 16.2 nm ± 15.0% to 16.4 nm ± 8.3%, 19.9 nm ± 5.9%, and then 21.4 nm ± 5.3% by increasing the NaOH amount from 0 mg to 3 mg, 4.5 mg, and then 6 mg (Fig. 9A–D). Increased NSNaF amount resulted in NaYbF4:Er with much lower diameter standard deviation. XRD pattern results of the as-prepared NaYbF4:Er agreed well with that of β-NaYbF4 by using 0–6 mg of NaOH (Fig. S10A–D, ESI†). Further increased NaOH amount (12 mg) provided non-uniform products in the presence of large nanocrystals and α-impurities (Fig. 9E and Fig. S10E, ESI†), indicating the formation of excess α-monomers and insufficient HF.
 Fig. 9  TEM images of UCNCs prepared by the binary sodium strategy: (A–E) NaYbF4:Er, NaOH/NaOA = 0:60, 3:57, 4.5:55.5, 6:54 and 12:48, respectively; (F–H) NaYF4:Yb/Er, NaOH/NaOA = 9:51, 12:48 and 15:45; (J) NaYF4:Yb/Er, Na/RE/F = 3.5:1:4, NaOH/NaOA = 6:78. (K–M) NaYbF4:Er, NaOH/NaOA = 0:60, with reaction times at 300 °C being 10 min, 20 min and 30 min, respectively. 
In order to verify the generality of the proposed binary sodium strategy, NaYF4:Yb/Er was synthesized. Uniform β-UCNCs were obtained by using 9 mg, 12 mg and 15 mg of NaOH (12.5 nm ± 5.4%, 16.8 nm ± 5.5% and 24.6 nm ± 5.3%; Fig. 9F–H and Fig. S11, ESI†). Compared with single NaOA based strategy, introduction of a small amount of NaOH provided simultaneous size focusing and tuning effects. Uniform sub-10 nm β-NaYF4:Yb/Er (9.5 nm ± 5.7%; Fig. 9J and Fig. S12, ESI†) could also be fabricated facilely by the proposed binary sodium strategy with simple modification. The proposed binary sodium strategy also provided excellent nanocrystal size reproducibility (Fig. S13, ESI†).
Particularly, high level of HF in single NaOA based solvothermal synthesis also led to serious Ostwald ripening phenomena. Uniform β-NaYbF4:Er with average diameters of 11.0 nm ± 6.5% and 12.5 nm ± 6.2% could be achieved by shortening the high-temperature reaction time from 60 min to 20 min and 30 min, respectively (Fig. 9K–Mvs.Fig. 3F and Fig. S14, ESI†). Single NaOA based strategy could also provide ultra-small β-NaYF4:Yb/Er with low crystallinity in very short reaction time (10 min); however, an attempt to achieve uniform β-NaYF4:Yb/Er with bigger size and higher crystallinity by using longer reaction time was unsuccessful because of Ostwald ripening phenomena (Fig. S15 and S16 (ESI†) vs.Fig. 3E). In spite of the limitation of single NaOA based solvothermal strategy in preparing uniform β-NaYbF4:Er with an average diameter of ∼20 nm because of the Ostwald ripening phenomena, such a strategy could provide uniform but much smaller β-NaYbF4:Er (∼12 nm) by using shorter reaction time. This is an important complement for the proposed binary sodium strategy. The above results also supported the effects of NSNaF in providing α-monomers and delaying Ostwald ripening for the proposed binary sodium source strategy.
Having overcome the control synthesis issues, β-NaYbF4 based UCNCs will receive more attention in practical applications. Hence, initial investigations into the upconversion efficiency of different sized β-NaYbF4:Er were conducted by using the well-known high-efficiency β-NaYF4:Yb/Er and β-NaYF4:Yb/Er@NaYF4 as control (Fig. 10). The β-NaYbF4:Er (12.5 nm)@NaYF4 (16.0 nm) provided even slightly stronger fluorescence intensity compared with that of much larger β-NaYF4:Yb/Er (24.6 nm)@NaYF4 (28.0 × 35.6 nm), and 3.0-fold and 5.8-fold intensity enhancement for green and red fluorescence compared with that of similar sized β-NaYF4:Yb/Er (12.5 nm)@NaYF4 (16.5 nm). β-NaYbF4:Er (21.4 nm)@NaYF4 (26.3 × 31.1 nm) provided 3.5-fold and 14.3-fold intensity enhancement for green and red fluorescence compared with that of β-NaYF4:Yb/Er@NaYF4 (28.0 × 35.6 nm). However, β-NaYbF4:Er showed much weaker fluorescence intensity than β-NaYF4:Yb/Er (Fig. 10E). Results showed that β-NaYbF4:Er suffered more seriously from surface quenchers than β-NaYF4:Yb/Er, but the fluorescence efficiency was much superior upon introducing inert NaYF4 shell layer.

4. Conclusions
We have presented intrinsic NaF and HF pathways for sodium sources of NaOH and NaOA in solvothermal synthesis of UCNCs. The formation of NSNaF by NaOH–NH4F reaction and the HF etching phenomenon/mechanism were observed or proposed for the first time. System HF was verified as an intrinsic motivation for the fast α-to-β transition of UCNCs and an origin of Ostwald ripening. A facile binary sodium source strategy was proposed and successfully used to overcome the issues in preparing small-sized and uniform β-UCNCs via simple in-situ partial conversion of NaOH to NaOA. The proposed strategy not only provided simultaneous nanocrystal phase and size regulation without the need of additional co-doping, but also avoided tedious metal oleate precursor preparation procedures and harsh reaction conditions. Size-tunable β-NaYbF4:Er (11.0–21.4 nm) with narrow size distributions were achieved. Finally, upconversion efficiency of different sized β-NaYbF4:Er was evaluated, showing small-sized β-NaYbF4:Er@NaYF4 had great potential in the context of highly complex bio-applications. Our findings provide advanced solvothermal growth mechanism and robust control synthesis strategies for β-UCNCs.
