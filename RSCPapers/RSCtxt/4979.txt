The near-infrared photosensitizing dye exhibits over 80% external quantum efficiency in a broad spectral range from 480 nm to 735 nm, and a high power conversion efficiency of 13.0% under irradiance of simulated AM 1.5G sunlight (100 mW cm−2).
Historically champion dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) were exclusively fabricated using organometallic compounds (e.g. ruthenium polypyridine and zinc porphyrin complexes) as the light-harvesting components, reaching the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13% under an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G sunlight so far.1,2 Concurrently, a large amount of research interest has been attracted to metal-free organic dyes, by virtue of ample crude materials, versatile molecular designs, and fascinating aesthetic effects.3,4 Lately, Kakiage and his coworkers5 wisely converted the famous MK-2 dye6 to an alkoxysilanated analogue, which allowed them to effectively fill defect-pinholes of the self-assembled dye layer with a couple of coadsorbates to attenuate interfacial charge recombination, and thereby achieved the consecutive PCE records of 12.5% and 12.8% for organic dye-sensitized solar cells.
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have experienced swift growth as a unique class of optoelectronic materials for applications in organic field-effect transistors, light-emitting diodes, and photovoltaics, due mainly to their natively high levels of π-conjugation and delocalization.7 In this regard, we used N-annulated perylene (1H-phenanthro[1,10,9,8-cdefg]carbazole, PC) as the electron-rich unit for a structurally simple donor–acceptor (D–A) dye C272, which achieved a monumental PCE of 10.4%.8 Succeeding explorations along this line by tailoring peculiar PAH segments as the central blocks of anti-aggregation organic photosensitizers have upgraded the PCEs of coadsorbate-free organic dye-sensitized solar cells, being over 12% at the moment.9
To further reduce the optical energy gap of dye molecules for improved absorption of near-infrared solar photons, we have conceived a coplanar PAH, 9,14-dihydro-4H-dithieno[2′,3′:2,3;3′′,2′′:10,11]piceno[1,14,13,12-bcdefgh]carbazole (DTPC). Our exploratory density functional theory (DFT) calculations presented in the ESI,† have disclosed that DTPC possesses a stronger electron-donating capability in contrast to PC. Apart from the nitrogen site for attaching flexible 2-hexyldecyl like PC, the two sp3 carbons of DTPC could be totally tethered with four hexylphenyl groups. These photochemically inert units will not only enable device fabrication via solution processing, but will mitigate the unfavorable intermolecular π–π stacking of dye molecules anchored on the surface of titania in DSCs. Notice that π–π stacking may engender intermolecular charge separation and/or exciton–exciton annihilation, both of which are ordinarily considered to be detrimental to the injection of electrons to titania apart from intramolecular excited-state deactivation.10 In this paper, for the first time we exploit DTPC as the central portion of a low-energy-gap D–A dye C280 (Fig. 1). Meanwhile, the intriguing attributes of DTPC for the design of DSC dyes will also be surveyed with respect to the 3,10-di(thiophen-2-yl)-1H-phenanthro[1,10,9,8-cdefg]carbazole (T-PC-T) based control C279 (Fig. 1).

Scheme 1 outlines the synthetic route to C280. Firstly, a palladium-catalyzed direct arylation of methyl thiophene-3-carboxylate with 1 was operated to produce 2 in a moderate yield, by resorting to the protocol reported by Schipper and Fagnou.11 Thereafter, we implemented a carbonyl addition reaction of 2 using (4-hexylphenyl)magnesium bromide to acquire a tertiary alcohol, which underwent intramolecular Friedel–Crafts cyclization to give 3 at an excellent yield of 90%. Later, compound 3 underwent a regioselective hydrogen–lithium exchange with n-butyllithium at a cryogenic temperature and then transformed to its correlated stannane, which was subsequently cross-coupled with 1-ethoxy-4-iodobenzene via the Stille reaction to afford 4 in a good yield. Later, we performed monobromination of 4 at 0 °C to get a bromide, which was used for the direct arylation of methyl thiophene-3-carboxylate to provide 5. After that, 5 was transformed to 6 in an excellent yield by means of the same procedures for 3. Furthermore, compound 6 underwent a hydrogen–lithium exchange with n-butyllithium and then was converted to its derived stannane, which was reacted with butyl 4-((7-bromobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)ethynyl)benzoate via the Stille cross-coupling to give an esterified dye precursor. Eventually, the ester was hydrolyzed with KOH as the catalyst, and the hydrolyzate was thoroughly acidified with a diluted phosphoric acid aqueous solution for C280. Details on the synthesis and characterization of C280 as well as its control C279 are compiled in the ESI.†

Reagents and conditions: (i) methyl thiophene-3-carboxylate, Pd(OAc)2, PCy3·HBF4, PivOH, K2CO3, toluene, reflux, 24 h; (ii) (4-hexylphenyl)magnesium bromide, THF, reflux, 6 h; (iii) Amberlyst 15, toluene, reflux, 6 h; (iv) n-BuLi, THF, −78 °C, 0.5 h; then Sn(CH3)3Cl, RT, 2 h; (v) 1-ethoxy-4-iodobenzene, Pd(PPh3)2Cl2, toluene, reflux, 6 h; (vi) NBS, THF, 0 °C, 0.5 h; (vii) methyl thiophene-3-carboxylate, Pd(OAc)2, PCy3·HBF4, PivOH, K2CO3, toluene, reflux, 24 h; (viii) (4-hexylphenyl)magnesium bromide, THF, reflux, 6 h; (ix) Amberlyst 15, toluene, reflux, 6 h; (x) n-BuLi, THF, −78 °C, 0.5 h; Sn(CH3)3Cl, RT, 2 h; then butyl 4-((7-bromobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)ethynyl)benzoate, Pd(PPh3)2Cl2, toluene, reflux, 6 h; (xi) KOH, THF/H2O (3/1, v/v), reflux, overnight; then phosphoric acid. 
To check the impacts of electron-donating module DTPC vs. T-PC-T upon the energy levels and energy gaps of dye molecules, we first performed nonaqueous voltammetric measurements of dye solutions under an inert atmosphere of nitrogen. From the perpendicularly floated cyclic voltammograms (CVs) displayed in Fig. 2a, we could infer the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels (Table S1 of the ESI†) by the equation: E = −4.88 − eEonset, where Eonset is the onset redox potential of a ground-state dye molecule in THF. It turns out that with respect to C279 using T-PC-T, the DTPC based dye C280 is endowed with a 0.23 eV destabilized HOMO energy level and a 0.01 eV stabilized LUMO energy level, giving rise to a markedly diminished LUMO/HOMO energy gap. It is thus plausible to witness a 139 nm red-shift of maximum absorption wavelength (λMEASABS,MAX) for C280 from Fig. 2b. Furthermore, the application of a fused electron-rich unit (DTPC vs. T-PC-T) also engenders an augmented maximum molar absorption coefficient (εMEASABS,MAX) of 58.9 × 103 M−1 cm−1 for C280, in opposition to that of 39.3 × 103 M−1 cm−1 for C279.

Decamethylferrocene (DMFC) was added as the internal reference and the potential was further calibrated with respect to the standard redox couple, ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+). Scan rate: 5 mV s−1. (b) Electronic absorption spectra of 10 μM dyes in THF. (c) LUMO energy levels (values above color bars), HOMO energy levels (value under color bars), and LUMO/HOMO energy gaps (EL/H) of dye molecules as well as their electron-donating (C2O-P-T-PC-T and C2O-P-DTPC) and electron-withdrawing (BTEBA) segments. The large aliphatic substituents were cut to ethyl for improved computational efficiencies. (d) Optimized geometries and contour plots of frontier molecular orbitals at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of dye molecules. The values of the isodensity surface are fixed at 0.03. 
Notice that theoretical calculations (Fig. 2c) can finely imitate the relative alignments of electronic energy levels. Further time-dependent DFT calculations have unveiled that the S0 → S1 vertical electronic transitions to the LUMO for these two dyes emerge principally from the HOMO, manifesting an explicit intramolecular charge-transfer character as readily discerned from contour plots of molecular orbitals in Fig. 2d. Also, we extended DFT calculations to electron-donating and electron-accepting blocks such as C2O-P-T-PC-T, C2O-P-DTPC, and BTEBA for a closer look at their energetically genetic relationships to dye molecules. It is valuable to note from Fig. 2c that both dyes are born with nearly identical HOMO energy levels to their corresponding electron-donors, and comparable LUMO energy levels to the mutual electron-acceptor.
To investigate the probable influence of adjusting the electron-releasing segment from T-PC-T to DTPC on electron injection yield (ϕEJ), time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) experiments were performed to probe the disparity in photoluminescence (PL) of dyed alumina and titania films. Knowing that no electrons can be ejected to alumina from these two organic dyes in the electronically excited-states (D*), we ascribed the dynamic PL decays (blue curves) in Fig. S2 (ESI†) to radiative and radiationless deactivation of D*. However replacement of the oxide film from alumina to titania induces substantial PL quenching (PLQ), which is promptly perceived by comparing the corresponding red and blue curves in Fig. S2 (ESI†). PLQ signifies that charge photogeneration should occur at the dye/titania interface, which has a favorable energy level offset. The areas under PL traces attained through time integration of intensity signals were also displayed as green curves for alumina samples and magenta for titania in Fig. S2 (ESI†) to approximately assess ϕEJ, being 0.94 for both C279 and C280.
Afterwards, we also monitored the kinetics of dual-path charge-transfer reactions of photooxidized dye molecules (D+) with free electrons in titania and cobalt(II) cations in an electrolyte, using a nanosecond laser flash photolysis system. The absorption traces (Fig. S3, ESI†) could be nicely fitted with multi-exponential functions for convenient determination of half-reaction times (t1/2). When an inert electrolyte with 0.1 M lithium bis(trifluoromentylsulfonyl)imide and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine dissolved in acetonitrile was applied, on a millisecond time domain we observed absorption decay signals that are related to the back electron transfer from titania to oxidized dye molecules. However in the presence of a Co-bpy electrolyte for DSC fabrication (for its recipe see the ESI†), we recorded much quicker absorption decays (panel b) in the microsecond time range, suggesting the occurrence of hole injection from D+ to cobalt(II) ions. The kinetic branch ratios of these two charge transfer reactions exceed 20, resulting in almost quantitative hole injection yields (ϕHI).
The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of DSCs made from bilayer titania films dyed with C279 and C280 were surveyed, at an interval of 10 nm for a series of incident monochromatic lights. For details on cell fabrication, see the ESI.† The photocurrent action spectrum (Fig. 3a) of a typical DSC with C280 exhibits a maximal EQE of 90%. Notably, even at 720 nm, its EQE is still higher than 80%. In addition, an over 50 nm red-shifting of the onset wavelength of the photocurrent response for C280 can also be clearly noticed, compared with its reference dye C279. This scenario is in rough agreement with wavelength dependent light-harvesting yields (ϕLH) shown in Fig. 3b.

(b) Wavelength-dependent light-harvesting yields (ϕLH) for 8.0 μm-thick nanoporous titania films grafted with dye molecules and also immersed in a Co-bpy electrolyte. (c) Current–voltage (J–V) curves measured under irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM1.5G sunlight. On top of a DSC was laminated an antireflection film. The aperture area of our metal mask was 0.160 cm2. (d) Open-circuit photovoltages (VOC) plotted against short-circuit photocurrent densities (JSC). The solid linear fittings were also included. (e) Plots of charges extracted from a dye-grafted titania film (QCE) versus VOC. (f) Plots of electron half-lifetimes (tTPD1/2) as a function of QCE. 
The photocurrent density–photovoltage (J–V) characteristics (Fig. 3c) were tested under irradiance of simulated AM1.5G sunlight (100 mW cm−2). The averaged cell parameters are collected in Table 1. Dye C279 delivers a short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) of 14.81 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (VOC) of 734 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 73.6%, corresponding to a PCE value of 8.0%. In accord with the integrals of EQEs over the standard AM1.5G emission spectrum (ASTM G173-03), dye C280 displays an intensified JSC value of 21.20 mA cm−2, an enlarged VOC value of 786 mV, generating a ∼48% augmented PCE of 11.8%, albeit a slightly reduced FF of 70.8%. Keeping in mind the strategy of improving VOCvia elongating the size of end-chains of dye molecules,12 we further replaced the ethyl unit of the narrow-energy-gap dye C280 with 2-hexyldecyl to construct its analogue C281, which affords an excellent PCE of 13.0%. We observed a very small efficiency drop of these three cells with the cobalt electrolyte left on the lab bench for over one month. Stability measurements under thermal and light-soaking stress will be addressed in a future study by employing a low-volatility electrolyte.

We also recorded J–V curves under a range of light intensities and plotted VOC as a function of JSC in Fig. 3d. It can be derived from the fitting curves that at a given JSC, VOC escalates in the order C279 < C280 < C281. To scrutinize the interfacial energetic and dynamic origins of the VOC variation,13 we further performed charge extraction (CE) and transient photovoltage decay (TPD) measurements. A virtually alike profile of charges extracted from titania (QCE) presented in Fig. 3e, illustrates that the conduction-band edge and the distribution of trap states of titania with respect to the electrolyte Fermi-level should not be altered by changing the dye molecules. However at a given QCE, the half lifetime (tTPD1/2) of free electrons in the titania film increases in the order C279 < C280 < C281 (Fig. 3f), mirroring the same tendency of VOC. The dye loading amounts (cm) on the mesoporous titania film were also estimated by visible spectrometry, being 2.0 × 10−8 mol cm−2 μm−1 for C279, 1.6 × 10−8 mol cm−2 μm−1 for C280, and 1.4 × 10−8 mol cm−2 μm−1 for C281. It is obvious that the adverse impact14 of a gradually reduced cm on VOC, is over compensated with stepwise additions of four hexylphenyl side units and elongation of the end chain, albeit their inactive response to visible photons.
To sum up, we have synthesized the first π-material characteristic of polycyclic DTPC, via two key procedures of palladium-catalyzed direct arylation and intramolecular Friedel–Crafts cyclization. The conjugation of a DTPC containing unit with BTEBA has generated a low-energy-gap organic dye reaching an excellent PCE of 13% under AM1.5G conditions. Further device engineering for enhanced performance is underway to take full advantage of this panchromatic photosensitizer.
Experimental section
The synthetic route to C281 as illustrated in Scheme S2 (ESI†) is similar to that to C280. The preparation details are described as follows.
11-(2-Hexyldecyl)-8-(4-((2-hexyldecyl)oxy)phenyl)-6,6-bis(4-hexylphenyl)-6,11-dihydrothieno[3′,2′:8,9]chryseno[10,11,12,1-bcdefg]carbazole (9). In a three-neck flame-dried round-bottom flask was dissolved 3 (3.62 g, 3.00 mmol) in THF (20 mL) and cooled to –78 °C using a dry ice/acetone cold bath. Under argon, n-BuLi (2.25 mL, 1.6 M in hexanes, 3.60 mmol) was added dropwise to the reaction mixture, which was stirred at –78 °C for 0.5 h. After trimethylstannyl chloride (0.72 g, 3.60 mmol) was added in one portion via a syringe, the mixture was slowly warmed up and stirred for 2 h at room temperature. Water was slowly added to terminate the reaction and the mixture was extracted three times with diethyl ether before the organic phase was washed with water and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After solvent removal under reduced pressure, the crude product 11-(2-hexyldecyl)-6,6-bis(4-hexylphenyl)-8-(trimethylstannyl)-6,11-dihydrothieno[3′,2′:8,9]chryseno[10,11,12,1-bcdefg]carbazole was used to synthesize 9 without further purification.
In a dried Schlenk tube were dissolved 11-(2-hexyldecyl)-6,6-bis(4-hexylphenyl)-8-(trimethylstannyl)-6,11-dihydrothieno[3′,2′:8,9]chryseno[10,11,12,1-bcdefg]carbazole and 1-((2-hexyldecyl)oxy)-4-iodobenzene (1.60 g, 3.60 mmol) in toluene (10 mL). Then Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 (154 mg, 0.22 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture, which was refluxed for 6 h under argon. Water was added to terminate the reaction and the mixture was extracted three times with chloroform before the organic phase was washed with water and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After solvent removal under reduced pressure, the crude product was purified by column chromatography (toluene/petroleum ether 60–90 °C, 1/20, v/v) on silica gel to yield a yellow oil as the desired product 9 (2.78 g, 76% yield). 1H NMR (400 MHz, THF-d8) δ: 8.59–8.57 (m, 2H), 8.05 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 1H), 7.96 (s, 1H), 7.84 (d, J = 8.8 Hz, 2H), 7.79 (d, J = 8.8 Hz, 2H), 7.75–7.71 (m, 1H), 7.60 (d, J = 8.1 Hz, 1H), 7.51 (d, J = 8.8 Hz, 2H), 7.27 (d, J = 8.4 Hz, 4H), 7.12 (s, 1H), 7.07 (d, J = 8.4 Hz, 4H), 6.88 (d, J = 8.8 Hz, 2H), 4.64 (d, J = 7.2 Hz, 2H), 3.89 (d, J = 5.6 Hz, 2H), 2.55 (t, J = 7.7 Hz, 4H), 2.46 (s, 1H), 1.60–1.56 (m, 4H), 1.47–1.44 (m, 6H), 1.38–1.30 (m, 38H), 1.26–1.25 (m, 9H), 1.21–1.19 (m, 6H), 0.91–0.85 (m, 12H), 0.82–0.79 (m, 6H). 13C NMR (100 MHz, THF-d8) δ: 160.36, 147.30, 146.20, 142.17, 142.02, 141.61, 136.22, 133.77, 133.65, 131.25, 130.77, 130.26, 129.25, 128.79, 128.06, 127.97, 127.53, 126.19, 125.71, 125.68, 125.58, 124.99, 124.37, 123.90, 122.79, 121.31, 118.90, 118.17, 115.71, 114.57, 106.66, 71.76, 59.18, 50.70, 40.99, 39.25, 36.52, 33.04, 33.00, 32.85, 32.64, 32.51, 31.17, 31.09, 30.84, 30.79, 30.72, 30.70, 30.46, 30.43, 30.30, 27.98, 27.96, 27.55, 14.61, 14.57.

In a three-neck round-bottom flask was dissolved 9 (2.44 g, 2.00 mmol) in THF (10 mL) and cooled to 0 °C using an ice/water cold bath. NBS (493 mg, 2.20 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture, which was stirred for 0.5 h at 0 °C. Chloroform was added before the organic phase was washed with water and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After solvent removal under reduced pressure, the crude product was purified by column chromatography (toluene/petroleum ether 60–90 °C, 1/10, v/v) on silica gel to yield a yellow oil as the intermediate product 13-bromo-11-(2-hexyldecyl)-8-(4-((2-hexyldecyl)oxy)phenyl)-6,6-bis(4-hexylphenyl)-6,11-dihydrothieno[3′,2′:8,9]chryseno[10,11,12,1-bcdefg]carbazole, which was used for the next reaction directly. In a dried Schlenk tube were dissolved 13-bromo-11-(2-hexyldecyl)-8-(4-((2-hexyldecyl)oxy)phenyl)-6,6-bis(4-hexylphenyl)-6,11-dihydrothieno[3′,2′:8,9]chryseno[10,11,12,1-bcdefg]carbazole, methyl thiophene-3-carboxylate (0.34 g, 2.40 mmol), and K2CO3 (0.41 g, 3.00 mmol) in toluene (20 mL).
