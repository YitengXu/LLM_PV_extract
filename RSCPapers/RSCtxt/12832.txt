    AbstractThe performance and stability of flexible carbon nanofiber (CNF) electrodes were investigated for a lead zirconate titanate (PZT) nanogenerator. A comparative study was carried out with indium tin oxide coated polyethylene 2,6-naphthalate (ITOP) electrodes. The piezo voltage generated for CNF/PZT/CNF was almost 2 V which is ∼10% higher than ITOP/PZT/ITOP after the bending test. The increase in voltage shows a good contact probability between PZT nanofibers and CNF electrodes and demonstrates the feasibility of CNFs as flexible and stable electrodes for nanogenerators.
Recently, carbon nanomaterials have attracted great attention due to their diverse applications as high strength as well as conductive materials for nanoscale-electronics. Among them, carbon nanofibers (CNFs) have been recognized as an exclusive form due to their exceptionally good electrical, thermal, optical, and mechanical properties.1,2 As examples, CNF-based supercapacitors,3 biosensors,4 lithium-ion batteries,5 and dye-sensitized solar cells6 have been developed with exceptional performance. This leads to a rapid increase in commercial demand for CNFs as an electrode material for flexible organic electronics. Until now, indium tin oxide (ITO) films have been commonly used as flexible electrodes in electronic devices.7 However, their certain technical limitations such as low flexibility, inherent brittleness of the oxides under tension, and initiation of cracks8 on over-flexing have restricted their use for stable flexible devices.9 ITO electrodes have lower electrical and mechanical stability that significantly affects the lifetime of nanogenerators.10 Also, the flat surface of ITO used as top and bottom electrode leads to a low contact probability (i.e., small number of active sites and high series resistance) between lead zirconate titanate (PZT) nanofibers and top electrode during pushing or bending, thereby reducing the output current density.10 Therefore, there is a strong need to develop alternate electrodes which are highly flexible, defect free, robust and highly conductive. CNFs can serve as an excellent electrode materials and now being considered as a potential alternative for conventional ITO based electrodes. Recently, our group reported application of CNF as an effective flexible electrode for cholesterol sensor.11 Over the last few years, ZnO,12,13 InN,14–16 ZnS,17 PZT,18,19 BaTiO3, and PVDF20,21 based piezoelectric materials have been widely employed for fabricating nanogenerators. However, there are some or other types of technical challenges associated with most of these materials, for instance, ZnO-based nanogenerators, suffer low piezoelectric coefficient and electromechanical conversion efficiency,22,23 whereas, high piezoelectric coefficient ceramics such as PZT24 and BaTiO325 films made by conventional methods are brittle and are infeasible for fabricating the flexible nanogenerators. On the other hand, PZT nanofibers fabricated by electrospinning possess considerable higher flexibility as compared to those prepared by other conventional methods and may offer significant decrease in device dimensions and better tolerance to bending stresses.26 Electrospinning is a low cost and scalable technique to fabricate CNFs and PZT with tunable nanostructures. However, there are still many challenges such as charge carriers, low flexibility, irregular surface morphology and Schottky contact for a generated current output and efficiency that need to be well addressed.27 In this work, we report application of a CNF network sheet as the top cathode electrode of PZT nanogenerators. The nanofiberous morphology of CNF helps to improve the energy performance and stability. Particularly, nanofiberous morphology of CNF electrode and PZT is highly suitable to each other in enhancing the contact probability. In this communication, morphological effect and the electrical stability of CNF films for PZT nanogenerators are investigated.
It is found that CNF films have a nanosized network surface with fiber size larger than PZT fiber size which favors nanofibers contacting more efficiently. The CNF electrodes increase the current generation, output voltage and as well as bending stability of the device. The preparation of CNF electrode and PZT nanofiber referred to the method reported previously28 and the procedure is detailed in Experimental section of ESI.† The length, width, and thickness of an effective PZT textile in a nanogenerator are 1.5 cm, 3 cm, and 150 µm, respectively. The detailed preparation steps of PZT nanofiber device using CNF and ITO-PEN (ITOP) electrodes are schematically presented in Fig. 1. Fig. 2 shows cross-sectional and surface analysis scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of CNF nanofiber, PZT, ITOP/PZT and CNF/PZT. As it is observed in Fig. 2a, the electrospun CNFs are smooth, uniform in diameter and have nanosized network. The detailed purity of CNFs is measured with EDAX and corresponding Fig. S1 is provided in ESI.† This nanosized fiber network of both CNF and PZT nanofibers facilitates the good contacting between them compared to flat surface of ITOP/PZT as shown in Fig. 2c and d. Also, we have found that the diameter of PZT nanofiber decreases from ∼150 nm to ∼100 nm after calcination at 650 °C and this decrease in size is attributed to the crystallization of PZT as shown in Fig. 3b and high resolution images are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†).28 During the calcination and cooling process, PZT has been reported to form a polycrystalline phase. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrum of sintered nanofibers shown in Fig. 3a indicated that no peaks related to the pyrochlore phase are found in the XRD pattern, and all peaks can be indexed with perovskite PZT phase. The composition ratio of PZT film after calcination was PbZr0.52Ti0.48O329 which agrees with JCPDS card no. 56-0900. It is evident that the PZT nanofibers have perovskite structure with good crystallinity. For further support to this claim the composition has also been calculated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and is reported in revised manuscript in Fig. S4 (ESI†). CNF showed a broad peak at ∼25°, associated with (002) plane from amorphous carbon materials. Raman spectroscopy was implemented to further elucidate the ferroelectric phase of PZT nanowires. Fig. 3b shows the Raman scattering spectrum of PZT nanowire arrays measured at room temperature. The Raman shift peaks of the PZT nanowires located at around 205, 275, 330, 591, and 740 cm−1 which are well matched with the typical Raman peaks of perovskite PZT.30,31 Raman peaks present at wave numbers 205 and 275 cm−1 correspond to one of the Es2TOd modes and to the ET + B1 modes, respectively.32 The peak at 330 cm−1 corresponds to the A1s2TOd mode. The peaks at 591 and 740 cm−1 correspond to the A1s2TOd and A1s3LOd modes, respectively. The phonon modes of the PZT nanofibers are typical of those found in the Raman spectra of perovskite PZT.33 Open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current are measured to characterize the performance of the nanogenerator as shown in Fig. 4. The performance of PZT nanofiber combined with electrospun CNF based nanogenerator has been investigated by analog signal recorder and a current amplifier to measure the voltage and current outputs. In Fig. 4a, the conversion of mechanical energy into electricity has been obtained by low pressing, high pressing and bending state. The CNF electrode is periodically bent and released by a linear motion. When the CNF is bent, the PZT nanofibers suffer a tensile stress and have a strain along their longitudinal direction. A piezoelectric potential difference appears between the PZT nanofibers, which drives electron flow from the low-potential end to the high-potential end. For current measurement, the short circuit is the key problem to be solved. As CNF is highly conductive and due to thin and networked PZT film structure, it is very hard to control the short circuit especially on the edges. In the current study, the double sided adhesive tape is used on the edges as layer to overcome the short circuit issue. Comparison of output voltage and current for CNF and ITOP based electrodes is shown in Fig. 4a–d. The generated voltage and current in both cases was found to be almost similar during low and high pressing conditions. During high pressing condition, the generated voltage and output current increases in both cases as increased pressing force generates more piezoelectricity in the generated voltage output for low pressing was found to be ∼0.5 to 0.7 V and under high pressing ∼0.9 to 1.2 V for both electrodes. Similarly, the output current for low pressing was found to be ∼10 to 15 nA and under high pressing ∼25 to 30 nA for both electrodes. From this observation, we can conclude the planner CNF based electrode does not show any significant improvement under the perpendicular force received by devices during pressing and releasing motion. The mechanism of the generation of output voltage and current depends on the charge generation due to the pressing and releasing force between the two adjacent electrodes. The pressing force generates piezo electric potential that drives the electrons flow through an external load from the high potential to low potential. These electrons accumulate at the interface of CNF and PZT to balance the piezoelectric potential. During releasing, these accumulated electrons flow back through the external load circuit. Hence in perpendicular pressing mode the interface between ITOP/PZT and CNF/PZT are acting in a similar ways. Interestingly during bending and releasing motion in Fig. 3a we have found better output performance in case of CNF based electrode ∼50 to 55 nA which is slightly higher as compared to ITOP based electrode ∼40 to 45 nA. The linking between CNFs & CNFs and CNFs/PZT is physical interaction. As evident from our SEM micrographs in Fig. 2a–d, it is clearly seen that under bending condition the ITOP electrode is forming air-gap between ITOP and PZT due to the flat surface of ITOP electrode. Contrastingly, no air-gap is found between CNF and PZT that increases the power generation efficiency due to superior interfacial contact. Furthermore, due to the rough network surface of CNF and PZT, the contact resistance is significantly lower as compared to ITOP. As a result, during bending and releasing CNF electrode transfers more charge to the external load circuit as can be witnessed from the higher voltage and current output shown in Fig. 4a–d. The flexibility and bending stability of CNF electrodes were checked by subjecting PZT device over 200 bending cycles. The nanogenerator generates stable power even for excessive strain. The device was quite stable and there is only ±5% change in the open-circuit voltage and closed-circuit current. These findings for the electrospun CNF based electrode are vital that demonstrate the potential of such materials for piezoelectricity generation.

Conclusions
PZT nanofiber based nanogenerators were fabricated using CNF as an electrode material. The results are compared with the devices using conventional ITOP electrodes. The results show that the CNF electrodes improve the piezoelectric voltage during bending and releasing tests. The improved contact between CNF and PZT fibers is found to be responsible for the improved performance of nanogenerators. We have also demonstrated application of a CNF network sheet as the top and bottom electrode for PZT nanogenerators. The nanofiberous morphology of CNF helps to improve the energy performance and stability. Particularly, nanofiberous morphology of CNF electrode and PZT is highly suitable to each other in enhancing the contact probability.
