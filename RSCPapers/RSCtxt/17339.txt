    , Accepted 30th August 2022First published on 15th September 2022AbstractUsing fossil fuels to meet energy demands has led to immense CO2 emissions, resulting in global warming. Efforts to capture CO2 and find renewable energy fuels have been a rapidly evolving field of science. Methanol has been widely investigated as a promising renewable fuel. In this study, three cases of renewable methanol production were evaluated to investigate the possibility of using methanol as a way of mitigating CO2 and simultaneously reducing the dependence on depleting fossil fuel resources. A rigorous techno-economic analysis of the three cases was performed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and risk involved in the production of renewable methanol by considering the market price of non-renewable methanol as a benchmark. Overall, the results indicate that considering the current market price ($ 560 per Mt) of methanol, renewable methanol production is not cost-effective. Risk analysis results further indicate that the economic risk associated with the investigated designs is between 96–100%. However, a comparison based on environmental performance reveals that the base and integrated designs are 17.5–51.3% better than the non-renewable methanol. In contrast, a 100% renewable design produces zero direct emissions. Hydrogen production price and plant scale are identified as the two crucial parameters for determining the feasibility of the process. Although the production of renewable methanol involves high risk, policy implications are discussed in this regard to pave the way for future improvements.
Introduction
With exponential population growth in recent decades, there has been a constant rise in global energy demand. Currently, fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and natural gas, supply 80% of the world's energy.1 The burning of fossil fuels leads to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly CO2, to the atmosphere. CO2 is a major contributor to global warming as it accounts for 76.0% of total GHG emissions.2 The average growth rate of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has reached 2–3 ppm per annum, with a monthly average of 415 ppm, as recorded in December 2020.3 Global warming is a crucial challenge worldwide and requires immediate action and focused research. The United Nations panel on climate change has recommended a GHG emission reduction of 50–85% by 2050 to tackle climate change.4 Several worldwide efforts have been made in this regard, including the International Paris Agreement, aiming to limit global warming to below 2 °C, compared to the pre-industrial temperature levels, by the end of this century. In addition, the Green Deal program launched by the European Commission in 2019 is an attempt to make Europe an environmentally friendly continent by 2050.3,5
There are two main solutions to mitigate CO2 emissions: carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon capture and utilization (CCU). For CCS, CO2 is collected, transported via pipelines, and stored in deep-ocean reservoirs or sediments. The requirement of geographical infrastructure, large underground storage spaces, and the associated costs make this method financially non-feasible. Additionally, CO2 leakage can cause ocean acidification, adversely affecting marine life.6 Therefore, CCS techniques are considered illegal in some countries. Alternatively, CCU strategies are promising for limiting industrial GHG emissions. CO2 can be used as feedstock for several chemical processes and converted into several value-added fuels and chemicals. Hence, in CCU techniques, CO2 is captured, utilized, and used to provide an economic advantage. Assen et al. reviewed several CCU technologies and assessed their life cycles; concluding that employing CO2 to make fuels like methanol and formic acid, otherwise made using fossil fuels, provides a significant environmental advantage in lowering GHG emissions.7,8 A similar study performed by Khamlichi and Thybaud examined thirty different chemical routes and concluded that utilizing CO2 for methanol production is among the best possible pathways for mitigating GHG emissions.9
Furthermore, the last decade has seen substantial development in renewable technologies to meet growing energy demands and reduce dependence on fossil fuels. With the improvement in renewable resources, the prices for solar-and wind-driven electricity have reduced by 73% and 23%, respectively, between 2010 and 2017.5 As the cost of energy production from renewable resources continues to decrease, the need for large-scale energy storage systems has increased. Although energy storage in batteries is a good option, long-term energy storage beyond the 100 kW h scale remains challenging. Among the proposed solutions, the production of renewable hydrogen from water electrolysis is a vital power-to-fuel technology that has reached a commercial scale with a 6 MW power capacity at 1400 Nm3 per h per stack.10 However, further improvements in this method are limited by the low volumetric energy density of hydrogen (∼8 MJ L−1).5 This limitation can be addressed by chemically binding hydrogen to a liquid carrier with a reasonably high energy density factor. For instance, methanol has an energy density of 18 MJ L−1—significantly higher than that of hydrogen.11
Methanol is widely used as a precursor for several chemicals and fuels. Methanol is an environmentally friendly fuel as it produces no toxic byproducts, such as oxides of sulfur and nitrogen, during its combustion. Therefore, it is a suitable fuel for transport, providing an excellent alternative to petrol and diesel. Additionally, it is used in fuel cells for electricity generation. In the 2018 issue of Market Analytics: Methanol and Derivatives, it has been reported that the production scale of methanol worldwide is constantly increasing.12 In 2019, the world's methanol production was 148 million metric tons and is expected to rise to approximately 311 million metric tons by 2030, considering the versatility of its commercial applications.13 Unfortunately, 90% of the current methanol demand is met using natural gas, thus depleting non-renewable resources and substantially contributing to GHG emissions. However, these issues have diverted the attention of industries and academia towards researching green methanol production routes using renewable energy resources.
Methanol production via hydrogenation of CO2 has been proposed as a green chemical process. This process is an interesting CCU strategy where catalysts are used in the reaction between CO2 and hydrogen captured via water electrolysis. Based on this process, several studies have been conducted by considering parameters to improve reactor efficiency, economic viability, and environmental impact. Van-dal et al. designed and simulated a CO2 hydrogenation process using Aspen Plus.14 M. Bowker15 suggested that for methanol production to be green using this route, it is essential to not only use captured CO2 but also hydrogen that comes from renewable sources. Atsonios et al. presented a comparative study of methanol production via hydrogen production using renewable resources (biomass, solar, and wind) and non-renewable electricity.16,17 Economic analysis of hydrogen production by various routes revealed that methanol produced using renewable resources is one of the key parameters in determining the cost of methanol, compared to methanol produced from fossil fuels. The majority of the studies carried out in this regard are based on process modeling and optimization to improve the economic feasibility of the reaction. A detailed analysis of the techno-economic and environmental assessment of methanol production carried out by González-Garay et al. indicates the amount of CO2 emissions that can be avoided using this method.18 In another study, Cordero-Lanzac et al. presented an economic analysis of the production of green methanol using CO2 hydrogenation and highlighted several bottlenecks in the process.19 A comparative study of various methanol production routes, including those from natural gas, and their life cycle assessments was conducted by Kibria and Adnan, revealing the key economic drivers for the feasibility of the process.5 Although various studies are available on the techno-economic and life cycle assessment of green methanol production, there is a lack of a system-level study involving economic and risk analysis and environmental impacts that can guide policymaking in this regard.
This study investigated a sustainable design for renewable methanol production utilizing green hydrogen and captured CO2. The steps involved are presented schematically in Fig. 1. A bird's eye view of sustainability, economic feasibility, environmental profile, risk analysis, and policy implications is presented. A comparative study is presented by performing process simulations on three cases: base, integrated, and 100% renewable. In the base design, methanol is produced using green hydrogen and captured CO2 without considering heat integration, while the processing energy demands are met using petroleum-derived utilities. The integrated design is analogous to the base case, except that heat integrations are implemented to reduce utility requirements. In the third case, 100% renewable methanol is produced by considering a fully heat-integrated process coupled with the utilization of renewable utilities obtained via the combustion of green hydrogen. As case 3 uses part of the renewable hydrogen otherwise used for methanol production, the hydrogen consumption in this design is higher than that in the base and integrated designs. Therefore, once accurate material and energy balances are obtained, techno-economic analysis under deterministic and stochastic conditions, risk analysis, and life cycle analysis is performed in step 3 to present policy implications for the large-scale deployment of renewable methanol production.
 Fig. 1  Framework to design a sustainable process for green methanol production. 
Methodology
Problem statement
The framework shown in Fig. 1 was used to design a sustainable methanol production system. The goal was to determine a cost-effective and environment-friendly process for methanol production to partially substitute petroleum products used for energy production and as a transportation fuel.
Renewable hydrogen production
Fig. S1† shows the methodology for determining the minimum production cost of renewable hydrogen produced via solar driven electrolyzer. We assumed that the power plant will be installed in Chile due to its relatively high solar potential, which is provided in Table S1 of the ESI.† As shown in Fig. S1,† the power produced from the power plant can be processed in two ways: it can be used directly in an electrolyzer or exported to the grid. The latter will happen when surplus power is available, or power is below the operating capacity of the electrolyzer. If needed, the renewable power exported to the grid can be imported again to ensure maximum utilization of the electrolyzer. We assumed that 0.03 $ per kW service charges will incur if grid infrastructure has to be used.
To find an optimal strategy for the minimum hydrogen production cost, we developed a mixed integer non-linear programming model and optimized it by minimizing the Levelized cost of hydrogen at 1 MW electrolyzer scale. The model comprises 2310 continuous variables, 2 non-linear variables, 289 discrete variables, and 2256 constraints. The complete mathematical model along with its parameter is provided in the ESI.† To find a globally optimal solution, the proposed model is implemented in GAMS and optimized using Lindoglobal solver.20
CO2 capturing process
The process flow diagram for CO2 capture is shown in Fig. 2, where monoethanolamine (MEA) is used to capture CO2 from the flue gas of a coal-based power plant to obtain CO2-rich gas (stream 11). The process is mature and has already been commercialized. As shown in Fig. 2, a flue gas with a molar composition of 13.1% CO2, 17.2% H2O, 2.4% O2, and 67.2% N2 is added to the bottom of the absorber (A-101). The solvent (stream 15) is added to the second stage of the absorber and water (stream 1) is added to the top of the column. This strategy helps to capture fugitive MEA that would otherwise go with cleaned flue gas, increasing the makeup (kg h−1) requirement of MEA. The column operates at 1 bar, separating CO2-lean gas (cleaned flue gas) in the top stream from CO2-rich gas (stream 4) containing a solvent and water in the bottom stream. The latter is pumped (P-101) to the stripper (S-101) to strip CO2 from the solvent and further processed in a flash column (F-101) to obtain CO2-rich gas. The bottom of the stripper contains MEA and water, recycled into the absorber after adding MEA (stream 14) and water makeup (stream 1).

Base design

Fig. 3 shows the process flow diagram for renewable methanol production using the base design. The process starts with green hydrogen compression (C-201) to 90 bar, followed by its combination with pure CO2 and a recycle stream in a mixer (M-201). Green hydrogen is obtained via solar-driven water electrolysis. The temperature of the outlet stream of M-201 is adjusted according to the reaction conditions (250 °C) using H-201. The stream is then directed to a plug flow reactor (R-201), where CO2 hydrogenation, involving three main equilibrium reactions, leads to methanol and water synthesis. CO2 conversion to methanol is exothermic and thermodynamically favorable at relatively low temperatures and pressures. Commercial CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts are used for low-pressure methanol synthesis, as suggested by Graaf et al.21 After methanol synthesis, the R-201 effluents are cooled (H-202) and sent to high-pressure and low-pressure flash drums (F-201 and F-202) to recover unreacted raw materials. The top streams of F-201 and F-202 are mixed in M-202, of which 99% is recycled and 1% is purged (S-201); the bottom stream of F-202 is sent to a series of distillation columns (D-201 and D-202). The key objective of D-201 is to recover light gases from the vapor distillate and other components (methanol, water, ethanol, and DME) in the bottom stream. Finally, D-202 receives the bottom products of D-201 and separates methanol from water and other impurities in the distillate with a purity of >99 wt%.

Integrated design
Heat integration analyses are mandatory to minimize process utility requirements and improve the energy efficiency of a manufacturing plant. Therefore, a heat integration analysis of the base design was performed. While a variety of stream matching is possible in Aspen Plus simulations, in reality, heat integration is limited by the physical distance between the unit streams, practical limitations on heat transfer between different material phases (e.g., solid–liquid), and the trade-off between the heat exchanger cost and energy savings. Therefore, in this study, a pinch-point calculation was not performed; rather, an engineering design approach that considers cost savings was utilized. Stream matchings were performed by considering a minimum temperature approach of 30, 20, 10, and 5 °C between gas–gas, gas–liquid, liquid–liquid, and liquid–condensing vapors, respectively. Heat integration between carbon capture and methanol production plants was not performed because, most likely, these two processes are commissioned at different locations.
100% renewable design
This design is conceived based on strict environmental sustainability, where the process is heat-integrated and 100% self-sufficient. The former is analogous to the process described in section 2.4, while the latter is a new feature in the previous design, where part of the renewable hydrogen is used to produce green utilities to power the entire process. In former designs, utilities were purchased; therefore, this section was not required. However, this additional section is mandatory to realize a 100% renewable design because it produces on-site utilities to meet its energy requirements. Process simulations were performed to model (1) combustion to determine the flow rate of hydrogen required for utility generation, (2) Rankine cycle to generate low-pressure steam for heating and high-pressure steam for power generation, and (3) cooling tower.
Process simulation and design
Aspen Plus V.12 was used to simulate the renewable methanol production process at an industrial scale of 100 MW to obtain rigorous material and energy balances for the subsequent techno-economic, risk, and life cycle assessments. The Redlich–Kwong–Soave equation of state (RK–SOAVE) and non-random two-liquid activity coefficient (NRTL) property packages were used to model the methanol process. Electrolyte-NRTL (ELECNRTL) and Peng–Robinson property packages were used to model the CO2 capture and utility systems, respectively. A kinetic-based rigorous plug flow reactor block was used to accurately model the methanol synthesis. The kinetic data required to model the reactor were obtained from Graaf et al.21 Similarly, the RADFRAC block was used to model distillation columns. Design specifications were used to optimize the distillation performance and product purity. The Aspen Plus process flow diagrams for the CO2 capture process and methanol production processes are shown in Fig. S2–S8 in the ESI.†
Techno-economic analysis
A discounted cashflow rate-of-return model was developed to perform technoeconomic analysis under deterministic and stochastic conditions to determine the economics of renewable methanol production via green hydrogen and captured CO2. The minimum product selling price (MPSP) of methanol ($ per kg) that makes the net present value equal to zero was used as a primary economic measure. The assumptions used in the techno-economic model and the factor strategy used to calculate the total capital investment (TCI) and total cost of manufacturing (TCOM) are listed in Table 1. The total installation cost (TIC) was estimated as follows:  where Cj,0 is the cost of the baseline equipment j, Qj and Qj,0 are the adjusted and baseline capacities of equipment j, respectively, and Ij is the installation factor of equipment j. Once the total installation cost of the plant was determined, the factor approach given in Table 1 was used to calculate the TCI.

The empirical relation given by Turton et al.22 was used to determine the TCOM:TCOM = f1COL + f2FCI + f3(CUT + CRM)where f1, f2, and f3 are multipliers given in Table 1, and COL, FCI, CUT, and CRM are the cost of operating labor, fixed capital investment, cost of utilities, and cost of raw materials, respectively. The cost of operating labor was assumed to be 1.6% of the total installation cost,23 while the cost of raw materials and utilities was determined from the material and energy balances. The unit prices of chemicals and utilities used to calculate the economic indicators are given in Table S3.† The non-discounted cash flow, NCFn for year n, is given byNCFn = −rnTCI + anWC + (R − TCOM)(1 − t) + D·twhere rn is the ratio of the TCI consumed during year n, D is the depreciation, and WC is the working capital. an is a parameter equal to −1 during year 3, 1 during the last year of the project, and zero for all other years. Finally, the net present value (NPV) is defined as  
Deterministic, stochastic, and risk analyses
In the deterministic analysis, MPSP was estimated using the nominal parameters (no uncertainty) reported in Table S3.† In stochastic analysis, the most influential sources of uncertainties are generally characterized using a random value generated from a uniform distribution function. Therefore, for further analysis, the scenario to be analyzed was set up based on the uncertainty ranges suggested in the literature for raw materials and process indicators (Table S4†). The main objective of the analysis was to determine the economic viability, i.e., the variation in MPSP and economic risk of renewable methanol production under uncertain conditions. Future scenarios (total: 10000) were generated and simulated, with the results mapped and analyzed statistically to determine variation in MPSP and economic risk. Risk is generally evaluated based on the MPSP by comparing the current market selling price of petroleum-based methanol (513.5 $ per Mt) with that of renewable methanol.27 In this study, risk is defined as the probability of the plant producing methanol at a price higher than the target petrochemical-based methanol price.
Life cycle analysis (LCA)
The goal of LCA in this study was to evaluate and compare the environmental impact of renewable and petroleum-based methanol production by considering gate-to-gate assessment. Eleven environmental indicators are considered in this assessment: abiotic fossil fuel depletion potential, abiotic depletion potential, global warming potential over 100 years, ozone-layer-depletion potential, human toxicity potential, freshwater-aquatic ecotoxicity potential, marine aquatic ecotoxicity potential, terrestrial ecotoxicity potential, photochemical oxidation potential, acidification potential, and eutrophication potential. The system boundary is shown in Fig. S9† which considers four stages: renewable hydrogen production, CO2 capture, methanol production, and methanol purification. It is important to mention that in petroleum-based methanol production, the required amount of CO2 and H2 is supplied from fossil-driven processes, therefore, CO2 capture and renewable hydrogen production stages are excluded from the assessment in this scenario. The material and energy required to produce one kg of hydrogen via water electrolysis is shown in Table S5.† The life cycle inventory is scaled for one kilogram of methanol (functional unit) and is shown in Table S6.† The characterization data used to calculate environmental impact are retrieved from the Ecoinvent 3.6 and ELCD databases (Table S7†) and characterized for life cycle impact assessment using the CML-IA V3.06 method in SimaPro 9.1.0.7.
Results and discussion
Process optimization of renewable hydrogen production
Process optimization was performed to determine the minimum cost for renewable hydrogen production for two scenarios: no grid and grid. In the former, renewable power export to the grid was excluded, while in the latter it was considered. The LCOH, key indicators, and primary costs are reported in ESI† and Table 2. Results indicate that the grid scenario is optimal because it gives a minimum LCOH of 4.0 $ per kg. Although the installed power plant capacity, as well as PV CAPEX in the grid scenario, is 2.56 times higher than that of the no grid scenario, the 2.07 times increase in annual operating hours of electrolyzer, improved the LCOH by 15%. This is because, the grid scenario produces 2.75 times more hydrogen than that of the no grid scenario, which improves the overall economics.

Process simulation of CO2 capture and green methanol synthesis
Process simulations of CO2 capture and methanol production plants were performed to obtain material and energy balances to investigate the strengths and weaknesses of renewable methanol production from green hydrogen and captured CO2; information on the process simulations are provided in the ESI.† The material balance indicated that the average CO2 conversion per pass was 25 mol%, consistent with the experimental data reported by An et al. In all the designs, a methanol purity of 99.5 wt% was achieved via distillation columns. The average unit consumption of CO2 and H2 was 1.44 and 0.2 kg/kg-methanol, respectively. The energy demands vary significantly, depending on the scenario; therefore, they are explained in their respective sections.
Deterministic analysis

CO2 capture plant. 
As already indicated, the average unit consumption of CO2 is 1.43 kg/kg-methanol; therefore, producing 145.0 kg per year or 100 MW methanol requires 25999.5 kg h−1 of pure CO2. Table 3 elucidates that 125317.6 kg h−1 of flue gas is required to produce the required amount of CO2 for subsequent methanol production. To capture >99 wt% of CO2 from flue gas, the solvent to CO2 (S/F) ratio is calculated as 10.1. Approximately 2.4 kg h−1 of MEA is lost from the cleaned flue gas, added constantly as makeup. The process consumes 96.8 MW for heating, 67.3 MW for cooling, and 240.2 kW as power. Thus, this process is energy-intensive, where the CO2 stripper (S-101) and flash drum (F-101) consume 99.99% and 77.40% of the total heating and cooling utilities, respectively. Overall, the CO2 capture process consumes 9.11 kW h kg−1-methanol. The TCI and TCOM values are determined as 20.3 M$ and 15.6 M$ per year, respectively.

Base design. 
Targeted methanol production process requires 3547.9 and 25999.5 kg h−1 of hydrogen and CO2, respectively. Overall, the process consumes 14.71 kW h kg−1-methanol, of which 9.11 and 5.60 kW h kg−1-methanol are consumed in the CO2 capture plant and methanol production plant, respectively. It is important to specify that these energy requirements do not involve heating integrations (excluding CO2 capture plants) and can be reduced substantially by implementing heat integrations. As shown in Fig. 4, the TCI of the whole plant is 94.9 M$, of which 78.6% is consumed in the methanol production section. Similarly, TCOM is found to be 151 M$ per year. The results in Fig. 5 show that the calculated MPSP is 1.14 $ per kg. Better insights can be drawn by analyzing the MPSP breakdown to investigate economic hotspots. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 5, 68.7% of the MPSP is due to the cost of hydrogen utilized in the methanol synthesis section. More specifically, the annual hydrogen purchase cost is calculated as 113.5 M$, 75.2% of TCOM, thus indicating that cost-effective green hydrogen production is crucial for the large-scale deployment of renewable methanol plants.

Integrated design. 
Overall, in the methanol section, energy savings of 52.6% were achieved compared to that of the base design, decreasing the total energy requirement from 5.6 to 2.7 kW h kg−1-methanol. More specifically, the heating and cooling demands are decreased from 38.9 and 59.4 MW to 13.1 and 33.5 MW, respectively, as shown in Fig. 6. Consequently, the annual costs of utilities of the methanol section decreased from 7.3 M$ per year to 3.8 M$ per year. It is noteworthy that the CO2 section is already heat integrated, with energy-saving potential below 1%. Combining the energy requirements of both CO2 capture and methanol production sections, it can be concluded that 11.9 kW h kg−1-methanol or 16.5 M$ per year are required to power the entire process.
 Fig. 6  Profile of energy savings via heating integrations. Total energy demand (TED) represents the energy demand of the entire process, i.e., CO2 capture and methanol production. 
Furthermore, the above-mentioned energy savings are achieved at the expense of increased TCI, as seen in Fig. 4, where TCI increases from 94.9 to 102.0 M$ and TCOM decreases from 151.2 to 148.1 M$ per year. These results indicate that additional investment will be recovered in just 2.5 years. The calculated MPSP for the integrated design is 1.12 $ per kg, representing a 2% improvement in the MPSP compared to that of the base design. Analogous to the base design, a high hydrogen purchase cost is the main contributor to the MPSP.


100% renewable design. 
The results for a self-sufficient process show that 23.3% extra hydrogen (871.04 kg h−1 for the CO2 capture section and 206.4 kg h−1 for the methanol section) is required to meet all energy requirements of the process. Overall, hydrogen at a rate of 4625.46 kg h−1 is required to achieve the targeted methanol production and for the required utilities. Approximately 80.8% of the extra hydrogen required is used in carbon capture facilities. The obvious benefit of this design is that it eliminates the utilization of petroleum-based utilities, resulting in zero CO2 emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. However, this improvement is achieved by additional investment and raw material costs of 113.9 M$ and 34.5 M$ per year, respectively. The calculated MPSP for this design is 1.466 $ per kg, 22.0% and 23.5% higher than that of the base and integrated designs, respectively. Fig. 5 shows that a 31.1% spike in MPSP is due to the utility section for CO2 capture and methanol production facilities. The results further show that capital and hydrogen purchase costs are the main contributors to the utility section.


Effect of plant scale on MPSP and TCI. 
The effect of plant scale on MPSP and TCI is interesting. The results in Fig. 7 indicate that in all cases, MPSP improves by increasing the plant scale, but at the expense of a huge investment. The maximum improvement (14.5%) in MPSP is achieved for a 100% renewable design. However, this design is still not cost-effective compared to the base and integrated designs considering the huge capital investment and extra hydrogen consumed in the utility section. A comparison of the current MPSP with the current petroleum-based methanol price (513.5 $ per Mt)27 reveals that even the best design produces methanol two to three times more expensive than its rival. However, it is evident that in the last decade, solar and water electrolysis technologies have significantly improved their cost-effectiveness. According to BloombergNEF, green hydrogen will cost around 2 $ per kg by 2030 and 1 $ per kg by 2050 to produce cheap renewable electricity, but only in locations with abundant renewable energy resources.28 Therefore, it is important to calculate the expected range of the MPSP of methanol considering all future uncertainties associated with the raw material, capital costs, and utility costs.

Y-primary axis = MPSP ($ per kg) and Y-secondary axis = TCI (M$). Blue and orange lines indicate MPSP and TCI, respectively. 

Stochastic and risk analysis
Stochastic and risk analyses indicate that uncertainties have a substantial impact on the process economic indicators presented in Table 4 and Fig. 8. The variation in MPSP, TCI, COM, and revenue is maximal for the 100% renewable design, consistent with the deterministic results. Despite the comparable TCI of the base and integrated designs, the results demonstrate that the MPSP and COM are the lowest for the integrated design. Thus, depending on the market conditions, the MPSP for integrated design can vary between 0.45 to 1.67 $ per kg.

The risk assessment results in Fig. 8 indicate that none of the process designs are cost-effective at the current market price (0.56 $ per kg) of methanol. The calculated risks for the base, integrated, and 100% renewable designs are 95.9%, 94.8%, and 100%, respectively. It was of interest to calculate the market price of methanol at which the economic risk becomes zero for all process designs. The results indicate that the market price of methanol at 1.66, 1.64, and 2.33 $ per kg leads to zero risk for the base, integrated, and 100% renewable designs, respectively.
LCA analysis
The characterization scores and indicators results of all process designs are shown in Fig. 9 and Table S8,† in which a positive value indicates an environmental burden, while a negative value indicates environmental savings. The environmental burden can take place due to the emissions generated from raw material extraction or transformation, the utility resources, and the direct release of gases and liquids into the environment. In contrast, environmental saving can be achieved by utilizing renewable hydrogen and captured CO2 (avoided raw materials) in the methanol production stage.
 Fig. 9  Comparative life cycle impact assessment of methanol production. ADP = abiotic depletion potential; AFFDP = fossil fuel depletion potential; GWP = global warming potential 100 years; ODP = ozone depletion potential; HTP = human toxicity potential; FWAETP = freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity potential; MAETP = marine aquatic ecotoxicity potential; TEP = terrestrial ecotoxicity potential; PCOP = photo chemical oxidation potential; AP = acidification potential; EP = eutrophication potential. 
Surprisingly, as shown in Fig. 9, all renewable methanol production designs are environmentally better than petroleum-driven methanol. However, the environmental indicators (except abiotic depletion potential) have much smaller values for 100% renewable design. This is because the energy source used in this process design has no direct emissions because it uses 100% of the utilities produced from green hydrogen. Therefore, this is the best process design in an environmental context.
Results indicate (Tables S9 and S10†) that in the base case and integrated designs, abiotic fossil fuel depletion potential, global warming potential, ozone-layer-depletion potential, marine aquatic ecotoxicity potential, terrestrial ecotoxicity potential, photochemical oxidation potential, acidification potential, and eutrophication potential is most significantly affected by emissions from the CO2 capture area, of which the main cause is the use of a large amount of steam (Fig. S10 and S11†). Overall results show that the emissions released during the consumption of fossil fuels to power the plant as well as heating utility utilized in CO2 capture and methanol purification areas have considerable impacts on the global warming potential. Whereas in the 100% integrated design (Table S11† and Fig. S12†), all environmental indicators are primarily affected by emissions from the hydrogen production stage due to extra hydrogen needed to meet the energy demands of carbon capture, methanol production, and purification stages. The utilization of deionized water in the hydrogen production area is found to be another major contributor to global warming potential, ozone-layer-depletion potential, photochemical oxidation potential, and acidification. Likewise, the utilization of potassium hydroxide in the hydrogen production area is one of the main drivers of eutrophication potential.
To this end, LCA suggests that the CO2 capture process should be improved significantly to decrease various environmental indicators. The techno-economic results indicate that the simulated process for CO2 capture consumes 6.3 MJ kg−1 of CO2, contributing 57.5% to the overall global warming potential of processing. Therefore, more energy-efficient technologies are required to improve the environmental performance of CO2 capture.
Policy implications
Previous results indicate that none of the process designs for renewable methanol production are cost-effective according to the current market price of methanol. The hydrogen price and plant scale are two crucial parameters in determining the cost-effectiveness and large-scale deployment of renewable methanol production. The maximum hydrogen price and two-point sensitivity have been identified as the determining factors for future research and development to make methanol production cost-effective.

Maximum hydrogen price. 
The maximum hydrogen price defines the upper limit for the hydrogen purchase price at the refinery gate to achieve a product selling price that would be competitive in the current petroleum-driven methanol market. In other words, the maximum hydrogen price will serve as the benchmark price for water electrolysis-based hydrogen, facilitated by technological improvements and process optimization. The selling price of renewable methanol is fixed at the current methanol price of 560 $ per Mt, and the hydrogen purchasing price is varied to achieve an NPV of zero to determine the maximum hydrogen price. Table 5 shows that the calculated hydrogen purchase price is maximum (1.28 $ per kg) for the integrated design, indicating its credentials as the best design. Clearly, a 100% renewable design is the worst scenario here because the calculated renewable hydrogen price is not easily achievable in the near future. Perhaps running methanol plants on 50% renewable and 50% petroleum-based utilities may help in improve economics while maintaining the environmental benefits of this design.

Hydrogen purchase price vs. plant scale: two-point sensitivity analysis. 
A two-point sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate a feasible combination of hydrogen purchase prices and plant scales. The hydrogen price and plant scale were varied between 1–4 $ per kg and 100–1000 MW, respectively, to achieve an MPSP of ≤0.56 $ per kg. The results in Fig. 10 indicate that for both the base and integrated designs, any combination of hydrogen purchase price below 1.2 $ per kg and plant scale ≥100 MW will produce renewable methanol at price lesser than or equal to the current methanol market price of 0.56 $ per kg. However, a 100% renewable design is cost-effective in the current market at plant scales ≥250 MW and hydrogen purchase prices ≤0.65 $ per kg. At the plant scale of 1000 MW and hydrogen purchase price of 1.2 $ per kg, the integrated design produces methanol at a hydrogen purchase price of 0.43 $ per kg, 23% lower than the current methanol price.
 Fig. 10  Two-point sensitivity analysis to find the optimal hydrogen purchase price and plant scale. 
It can be implied that factors affecting the renewable hydrogen purchase price directly influence the overall methanol price and should be considered while deriving policies. One of the most important factors is the geographical location where renewable energy is being used to produce hydrogen. In countries with rich supply of renewable resources, the price of hydrogen will be lower as compared to countries with little or no renewable resources. However, it is not only the abundance of renewable resources in a country that can guarantee a lower hydrogen price. The approach of a law-making institution towards managing the energy demand, the general culture of the area, and the availability of financial resources; eventually regulates the uptake of renewable energy technologies. Infrastructure upgrades required for renewable energy deployment as well as its transmission and distribution often become a site-specific issue that may involve approvals from planning authorities as well as face local opposition. Hence, apart from financial and economic feasibility, it is important to reflect on how willing the local governments and community leaders are to incorporate renewable energy in their urban planning and building codes as well as spreading awareness about the matter. Areas with proper regulatory measures and set targets to invest or purchase renewable energy along with tax credits and exemptions, often see an acceleration in adopting large-scale production of renewable energy. However, due to large variations in the aforementioned factors, it is not easy to generalize a policy trend. Studies on finding correlations between all these factors and their overall effects on the hydrogen purchase price are required for future research.

Conclusion and future directions
Methanol production from captured CO2 and green hydrogen was studied in this work, considering the parameters that dictate the performance of the process and its large-scale implementation in the future. Techno-economic and risk analyses was performed to analyze the financial feasibility. Additionally, a life cycle assessment was performed to compare the GWP of green methanol with that of conventional petroleum-based methanol. A sensitivity analysis of the two crucial factors, hydrogen price, and plant scale, was performed to determine improvement areas in future studies.
The simulations performed on CO2 capture using MEA reveal an energy-intensive process requiring approximately 9.11 kW h kg−1-methanol, accounting for approximately 62% of the total energy requirement in the base design. A cost breakdown of the finances involved in the base design suggests that the hydrogen production step significantly affects the methanol selling price. In the second scenario, by applying heat integration, it was possible to reduce the energy requirements to an extent, resulting in a 2% improvement in the selling price. In the 100% renewable production case, it was possible to eliminate CO2 emissions by using hydrogen to power utilities. However, the extra hydrogen added increased the price, making this process economically ineffective. When large-scale plants are considered, the price of methanol is reduced. However, such plants require huge investments, which currently do not seem feasible due to the risk involved. Stochastic and risk analyses revealed the high risk involved in the discussed process designs, indicating that the current selling price of methanol is significantly lower than that calculated in the designs presented in this study. However, the environmental profile of these designs is particularly interesting as the base and integrated designs have up to 17.5% and 51.29% lower GWP, respectively, compared to that of the petroleum-based methanol. A two-point sensitivity analysis establishes a link between the hydrogen production price and plant scale, suggesting that it is possible to achieve a significantly lower methanol cost when the integrated design is used with a plant capacity of 1000 MW and a hydrogen purchase price of 1.28 $ per kg.
Therefore, it is essential to focus on rendering hydrogen production technologies in the future to reduce the gap in the prices of green methanol and the current petroleum-based methanol. There is a need to develop a novel water electrolysis technology or identify better catalyst candidates that can reduce the energy and cost requirements for hydrogen production. In addition, further reduction in the costs of solar or wind energy generation in the future is vital to ensure that the overall hydrogen price can be controlled. The CO2 capture and utilization method can be further improved by finding better capturing techniques by using more efficient and cost-effective absorbents to help lower the cost of CO2 capture, and hence, the resulting methanol selling price. By targeting these expensive steps, it is possible to make the green methanol production process economically more appealing. Overall, if a trade-off is reached to minimize CO2 emissions and the associated cost, a better alternative methanol production process can be established. Consequently, it is important to highlight the technology gaps that need attention to ensure the adoption of a focused approach in the future.
