    , Accepted 24th June 2021First published on 25th June 2021AbstractAll-inorganic cesium lead halide (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, and I) perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) have great potential application due to their unique optoelectronic properties. However, poor luminescence stability caused by some inevitable factors such as light, moisture and heat always restricts their practical application. In this work, the stability of CsPbX3 (X = Cl0.5Br0.5, Br, and Br0.5I0.5) PQDs is improved by encapsulating them in stable hollow mesoporous NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanoparticles (HMNPs). Compared to pristine PQDs, HMNP–PQD composites exhibit stable photoluminescence properties that can be maintained for more than 60 days under ambient atmospheric conditions. Thanks to the protection of HMNPs, the composites show much higher long-term stability in highly humid air and enhanced stability against UV light treatment compared to naked CsPbBr3 PQDs. Based on the proposed confinement effects of PQDs coordinated with the hollow mesoporous structure of NaYF4:Yb/Tm, the related structural model of NaYF4:Yb/Tm@PQD composites is discussed. Moreover, dual-mode luminescence can be observed in the NaYF4:Yb/Tm@PQD nanocomposites under 365 nm UV light and 980 nm laser excitation, indicating that the as-designed composites have great potential for dual-mode anti-counterfeiting application. This work provides a new idea for the stabilization and application of CsPbX3 PQDs.
1. Introduction
Stability is the common issue for all of the perovskite-related applications, and their poor stability limits their broad applications. Recently, all-inorganic lead halide perovskite CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) quantum dots (PQDs) have emerged and are widely used because of their superior optical and electronic properties, such as a large absorption cross-section, size-dependent and tunable emission wavelength, high color purity, and high photoluminescence (PL) efficiency.1,2 However, the intrinsic instability toward moisture, temperature, light, and polar solvents and the ease of anion-exchange of CsPbX3 PQDs easily destroy the crystal structure of PQDs, resulting in severe luminescence quenching. This drastically hampers the application of PQDs in lasers, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and photodetectors.3,4 In recent years, many successful strategies have been developed to protect CsPbX3 PQDs and improve their stability.5–10 Among them, the more common strategies to improve the stability of PQDs include sealing with appropriate organic ligands, surface coating, surface defect passivation, metal doping, self-assembly, etc.11–16 It is well known that most inorganic materials are relatively stable, have strong mechanical properties, and exhibit better heat resistance than most organic materials.17,18 Inorganic material coating has become the most effective way to enhance the stability of PQDs.19 Inorganic materials such as CaF2, TiO2, SiO2, Al2O3 and zeolites are widely used to stabilize PQDs.20,21 For example, Wei et al. improved the stability of PQDs by integrating them in CaF2 hierarchical nanospheres.22 Li et al. reported a facile method of coating a TiO2 shell on CsPbBr3 PQDs; the coated TiO2 shell can serve as an efficient protective layer to enhance the stability of CsPbBr3 PQDs.23,24 It is still urgent to find a suitable matrix coating material to improve the stability of CsPbX3 PQDs.
Recently, Tm:KYb2F7 and CsPbX3 dual-phase nanoparticles (NPs) were embedded in glass, which realized the upconversion (UC) emission of CsPbX3 PQDs.25 In addition, the UC emission of CsPbBr3 PQDs is achieved by mixing CsPbBr3 PQDs and Tm:NaYbF4 NPs in glass, which endows PQDs with long-term anti-decomposition stability. However, the study on the composite of PQDs and UCNPs is still in its infancy. NaYF4 NPs are often considered to be an excellent matrix material for high efficiency UC luminescence because of their fascinating optical and chemical properties, widely used in biological fluorescence labeling and imaging, lasers, solar cells and anti-counterfeiting technology.26–32 In addition to improving the stability of PQDs, functionalized substrate adsorption coating endowing the system with new luminescence functions facilitates the in-depth and extensive regulation of optical properties.33–36 In this work, NaYF4:Yb/Tm@PQD nanocomposites are successfully constructed by a simple hydrolysis-encapsulation strategy. CsPbX3 (X = Cl0.5Br0.5, Br, and Br0.5I0.5) PQDs are embedded in hollow porous NaYF4:Yb,Tm to prepare PQD-encoded fluorescent microspheres. The highly stable hollow porous NaYF4:Yb,Tm can greatly improve the stability of PQDs under light, air, and moisture conditions. Benefiting from the dual-wavelength excitation characteristics, the composites have been successfully applied to dual-mode anti-counterfeiting.37–39Scheme 1 depicts the synthetic scheme of the NaYF4-PQD hollow porous complex, via a hydrolysis-encapsulation strategy. NaYF4-PEI was prepared by a template assisted hydrothermal method. 100 mg of HMNP powder were added to a CsPbX3 PQD hexane solution (10 mL, 10 mg mL−1). After ultrasonic treatment, the air inside HMNPs was discharged, and PQDs with a particle size less than 10 nm were penetrated into the mesoporous channel of HMNPs. In order to completely embed CsPbX3 PQDs into the HMNPs matrix, the mixed solution was continuously stirred for 1 h during ultrasonic treatment to obtain HMNP-PQDs.

2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Lead chloride (PbCl2, 99.999%), lead bromide (PbBr2, 99.999%), lead iodide (PbI2, 99.999%), 1-octadecene (ODE, 90%), oleic acid (OA, 90%) and oleylamine (OAm, 70%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3, 99.99%), ethyl formate (MeOAc, 99%) and sodium fluoroborate (NaBF4, 99%) were purchased from Aladdin Reagent Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China). Rare earth oxides RE2O3 (99.99%) (RE = Y, Yb, and Tm) and urea were provided by Aladdin, China. Polyetherimide (PEI) was purchased from the Nanjing Duodian Chemical Limited Company. Rare earth chloride (RECl3) stock solutions of 0.1 M were obtained by dissolving the corresponding metal oxide in hydrochloric acid under heating with agitation. Deionized water with a resistivity of 18.25 MΩ cm was used in all the experiments.
2.2 Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) data of the as-prepared samples were measured utilizing a D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (Bruker AXS, Germany) equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15405 nm) at a scanning rate of 6° min−1 in the 2θ range from 10 to 70°. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were carried out using a Hitachi F-7000 spectrophotometer equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp as the excitation source. The absorption spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-3101PC scanning spectrophotometer. The morphology of the samples was characterized on a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope (SEM) and FEI Tecnai G2 STwin with a field emission gun operating at 200 kV transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The fluorescent decay curves were obtained from a Lecroy Wave Runner 6100 Digital Oscilloscope (1 GHz) taking a tunable laser (pulse width = 4 ns and gate = 50 ns) as the excitation (Continuum Sunlite OPO) source. All of the measurements were carried out at room temperature. The photographs were taken with a digital camera without any ornament. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method was used to determine the specific surface area. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out on a thermal analysis instrument (SDT 2960, TA Instruments, New Castle, DE) in a nitrogen flow.
2.3 Preparation of Y(OH)CO3:30%Yb3+,0.5%Tm3+ precursors
In a typical synthesis, 6 mmol of RECl3 (Y:Yb:Tm = 69.5:30:0.5) and 6 g of urea were dissolved in 200 mL of deionized water. The solution mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 min, heated and maintained at 90 °C for 4 h in an oil bath, and then allowed to cool down to room temperature naturally. The obtained precipitates were separated by centrifugation, washed twice with ethanol and deionized water, and finally dried at 70 °C for 6 h.
2.4 Synthesis of hollow and mesoporous structured NaYF4:30%Yb3+,0.5%Tm3+ NPs
In a typical synthesis, 1 mmol of Y(OH)CO3:30%Yb3+,0.5%Tm3+ precursors was dispersed into 20 mL of deionized water containing 0.8 g of PEI by ultrasonication and vigorous stirring for 0.5 h. Then, 4 mmol of NaBF4 was added into the above solution mixture. After additional agitation for 10 min, the as-obtained solution was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon autoclave, sealed and maintained at 130 °C for 4 h. As the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature naturally, the resulting precipitates were separated via centrifugation, washed three times with ethanol and deionized water, and finally dried at 80 °C for 12 h. Finally, hollow and mesoporous structured NaYF4:30%Yb3+,0.5%Tm3+ nanoparticles (HMNPs) can be obtained.
2.5 Synthesis of all inorganic colloidal CsPbX3 PQDs
First, a cesium oleate (Cs-oleate) precursor solution was prepared. Cs2CO3 (81.5 mg), 0.25 mL of OA, and 4 mL of ODE were placed in a three-necked flask and degassed for 10 min. The solution was then heated to 120 °C under a N2 flow atmosphere with constant stirring for 40 min until a clear solution was obtained. Next, 69 mg of PbBr2, 0.5 mL of OA, 0.5 mL of OAm and 5 mL of ODE were added to another 100 mL three-necked flask and stirred under N2 flow. The temperature was kept at 120 °C for 1 h until the adequate dissolution of PbBr2. Then, the temperature was increased to 170 °C, and the as-prepared Cs-oleate solution (0.4 mL) was injected into the system rapidly. After 5 s, the reaction mixture was cooled down to room temperature by an ice–water bath. The CsPbBr3 PQDs were collected by adding 20 mL of toluene and centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 min. The precipitated PQDs were dispersed by adding 10 mL of toluene. A series of all inorganic colloidal CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) PQDs were prepared by varying the lead halide (PbX2) following a similar strategy.
2.6 Synthesis of NaYF4:30%Yb3+,0.5%Tm3+-CsPbX3 (HMNP-PQD) nanocomposites
In this procedure, the vessel with HMNP powder was degassed using a vacuum pump to exclude the inner air. Then, 10 mL of CsPbX3 hexane solution was mixed with 100 mg of HMNP powder. The resulting solution was sonicated for 10 min. The HMNP-PQD nanocomposite powder was obtained through centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 3 min and dried in a vacuum oven at 40 °C for 1 h.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 High quality CsPbX3 downconversion luminescent material
In this work, blue-violet-emitting CsPbCl1.5Br1.5, green-emitting CsPbBr3 and yellow-emitting CsPbBr1.5I1.5 PQDs were prepared by means of heat injection. XRD patterns of CsPbCl1.5Br1.5, CsPbBr3 and CsPbBr1.5I1.5 PQDs are shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen that the diffraction peaks located at 2θ = 15.0°, 21.3°, 30.2°, 37.6°, and 43.8° can be assigned to the crystal planes (1 0 0), (1 1 0), (2 0 0), (2 1 1) and (2 2 0) of CsPbBr3, respectively. All diffraction peaks shift to the small angle direction due to the change in interplanar spacing caused by the different halide ion radii [r(Cl−) < r(Br−) < r(I−)]. Because the radius of the chloride ion is the smallest, the interfacial spacing of nanocrystals containing chlorine is smaller, and according to the diffraction equation, the diffraction angle will increase.

The morphologies of all as-prepared CsPbX3 PQDs were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 2a–c, the samples show a typical cubic shape, with an average size of about 10 nm. According to the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image in Fig. 2d, the lattice plane distance is 0.58 nm, which can be assigned to the crystal plane (100) of CsPbBr3 PQDs. Fig. 3 shows the UV–vis absorption and PL emission spectra of CsPbCl1.5Br1.5, CsPbBr3 and CsPbBr1.5I1.5 PQDs at room temperature. As shown in Fig. 3a, the resulting CsPbCl1.5Br1.5, CsPbBr3 and CsPbBr1.5I1.5 PQDs show the absorption onset at 430, 500 and 530 nm, respectively. For pure CsPbBr3 PQD samples, the surge green emission peak at 525 nm with a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 22 nm is clearly observed in Fig. 3b. The blue narrow emission at 466 nm for CsPbCl1.5Br1.5 (FWHM ∼ 29 nm) and yellow narrow emission at 560 nm (FWHM ∼ 30 nm) for CsPbBr1.5I1.5 are also observed.

3.2 Characterization of NaYF4:30%Yb3+,0.5%Tm3+ NP HMNPs

Fig. 4a shows the XRD patterns of the as-prepared NaYF4:30%Yb3+,0.5%Tm3+ HMNPs and standard card JCPDS no. 27-0814. Clearly, all of the diffraction peaks are in good accordance with the standard data. As exhibited in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image (Fig. 4b–e), the Y(OH)CO3:30%Yb3+,0.5%Tm3+ precursors and NaYF4:30%Yb3+,0.5%Tm3+ HMNPs are monodispersed and present uniform solid spheres with an average diameter of 200 nm. Fig. 4f and g shows the TEM images of NaYF4:30%Yb3+,0.5%Tm3+ HMNPs, and a large amount of pores inside the NPs are observed. The HMNPs present uniform spheres with an average diameter of 200 nm. The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm and pore size distribution of the mesoporous structures are shown in Fig. 4h. The BET surface area and pore volume are 18.6 m2 g−1 and 0.166 cm3 g−1, the pore-sized distribution curves show a broad distribution (in the insets of Fig. 4h). The PQDs could infiltrate into the pores of HMNPs for improving the stability of PQDs by protecting perovskites from coming in contact with the environment directly. The changes in optoelectronic properties for the PQDs can be attributed to three factors: (a) continuous illumination could induce agglomeration of PQDs, which leads to spontaneous growth and eventually the formation of large crystals. These large nanocrystals with high surface defects will lose PLQY. (b) Owing to the low formation energy, the intrinsic instability for oxygen, moisture, temperature, and polar solvents, and the ease of anion-exchange of CsPbX3 PQDs easily destroy the crystal structure of PQDs, resulting in severe luminescence quenching. (c) The PL emission of CsPbX3 PQDs will quench due to the degradation and agglomeration of PQD nanocrystals under thermal stress and also brings great difficulties in their application. Hence, it is reasonable to speculate that the highly stable hollow porous NaYF4:Yb,Tm can greatly improve the stability of PQDs under light, air, and moisture conditions by protecting perovskites from coming in contact with the environment directly and restricting their growth.

3.3 Stability of NaYF4:30%Yb3+,0.5%Tm3+/CsPbX3 composites

Fig. 5 shows the XRD patterns of NaYF4:30%Yb3+,0.5%Tm3+/CsPbBr3 composites. Diffraction peaks for HMNPs can be observed and the signals for PQDs are weak due to their smaller particle size. Fig. 6a shows the TEM image of the NaYF4-PQD composites, which clearly displays the embedded PQDs within the NaYF4:30%Yb3+,0.5%Tm3+ NPs. Fig. 6b shows the corresponding HRTEM image of these embedded CsPbBr3 QDs in the NaYF4-PQD sample. Clear lattice fringes with a lattice plane distance of 5.8 Å, which corresponds to the crystal plane (100) of CsPbBr3 PQDs can be observed clearly. The components of NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+/CsPbBr3 are further confirmed by elemental mapping. As can be seen from Fig. 6c, Cs, Pb, and Br signals are observed and overlap well, indicating that PQDs are penetrated into NaYF4:30%Yb3+,0.5%Tm3+ HMNPs.

Fig. 7a–c show the PL and UV/Vis absorption spectra of HMNPs/CsPbBr1.5Cl1.5, HMNPs/CsPbBr3, and HMNPs/CsPbBr1.5I1.5 composites, respectively. Pristine CsPbBr1.5Cl1.5, CsPbBr3, and CsPbBr1.5I1.5 PQDs emit strong light at 466, 525, and 560 nm, respectively. The three HMNP-PQDs also exhibit bright blue-violet, green and yellow light with emission peaking at 452, 525, and 560 nm, respectively, basically agreeing with their pristine counterparts. The luminescent images of these composites under ultraviolet (UV) light (in the insets of Fig. 7a–c) also demonstrate the bright light emission from composites.

We can expect that NaYF4 with good chemical stability could be used to stabilize the CsPbX3 PQDs, so the PL properties of pristine CsPbBr3 PQDs and HMNPs penetrating different concentrations of CsPbBr3 composite materials were studied, as shown in Fig. 8. The photostability of HMNPs–CsPbBr3 composites under UV lamps (365 nm) was investigated first. Fig. 8a and b shows the PL spectra of pristine CsPbBr3 PQDs and HMNPs–CsPbBr3 composites under excitation with a UV lamp (λ = 365 nm, 12 W) for 384 h, respectively. Fig. 8c depicts the variations of PL intensity of these samples to check whether they can maintain a certain emission intensity after 384 h. We can see that the PL intensity of pristine PQDs quickly weakens and even quenches within 240 h when the pure CsPbBr3 PQDs were placed under UV light conditions. The HMNPs can act as a protecting shell for the confined CsPbX3 perovskites; even after 240 h, the HMNPs–CsPbBr3 composites still retain over 70% of their original PL intensity. Moreover, with an increase in the content of CsPbBr3 in HMNPs–CsPbBr3 composites, the quenching of PL intensity becomes weaker and weaker under UV light irradiation, implying better photostability properties of the as-designed composites.

(d, e) PL spectra and (f) normalized PL intensity of CsPbBr3 and NaYF4–CsPbBr3 composites stored in air. (g, h) PL spectra and (i) normalized PL intensity of CsPbBr3 and NaYF4–CsPbBr3 composites placed in a moist environment (about 100% humidity). 
In the next step, the stability of these samples stored under ambient conditions was studied. From the PL spectra of pristine CsPbBr3 PQDs and HMNPs–CsPbBr3 composites under an ambient atmosphere for 60 days in Fig. 8d and e, the PL intensity of CsPbBr3 became very weak after 10 days. In contrast, these as-designed composites show much higher stability. As shown in Fig. 8f, the PL intensity of HMNPs–CsPbBr3 composites can maintain 80% of the initial PL intensity. The luminescent photos of HMNPs–CsPbBr1.5Cl1.5, HMNPs–CsPbBr3, and HMNPs–CsPbBr1.5I1.5 under ambient storage conditions for 0, 30 and 60 days in Fig. 9 also indicate their good stability properties. In order to further explore the superior stability of HMNPs–CsPbBr3 composites, the water-resistant test was conducted in the sealed container with 100% humidity at room temperature. As depicted in Fig. 8g–i, unprotected PQDs suffered from drastic losses in optical response. Compared with the luminescence quenching of the pristine PQDs within 48 h storage under a moist atmosphere, that of the composites preserved the value of 83%, indicating much better water-resistant properties for the as-designed composites.

The PL decay curves of pristine CsPbX3 (X = Cl0.5Br0.5, Br, and Br0.5I0.5) PQDs and HMNPs–PQD composites are shown in Fig. 10, and their average PL lifetimes are presented in Table 1. The PL decay curves can be well fitted with bi-exponential functions by the formula: I(t) = I1exp(−t/τ1) + I2exp(t/τ2). The average PL lifetimes of CsPbX3 (X = Cl0.5Br0.5, Br, and Br0.5I0.5) PQDs were calculated to be 5.92, 6.01, and 7.23 ns, and the average lifetimes of HMNPs–PQD composites were calculated to be 5.98, 6.41, and 9.08 ns, respectively. The PL lifetimes of composites are longer than that of pristine PQDs. The prolonged lifetimes not only imply that the PQDs were packed into HMNPs but also indicate that PQDs were effectively passivated by HMNPs.

The up-conversion emission properties of HMNPs–PQD composites were studied under the excitation of 980 nm diode lasers with 2 W power. Under the excitation of 980 nm laser, UC ultraviolet emission at 365 nm, blue emission at 450 and 475 nm and red emission at 650 nm ascribed to the transitions of Tm3+: 1I6 → 3F4, 1D2 → 3H6, 1D2 → 3F4, 1G4 → 3H6 and 1G4 → 3F4 as well as the weak band emission peaking at 524 nm from CsPbBr3 PQDs can be observed in Fig. 11a. With increasing concentration of PQDs, the emission at 524 nm for PQDs enhanced gradually, which can be verified by the variation in the CIE chromaticity coordinates of HMNPs–PQDs with different concentrations of PQDs in Fig. 11b. Fig. 11a and b indicates that the sample with NPs + 1 ml PQDs exhibited the highest emission intensity. Fig. 11c depicts the schematic representation of the UC energy transfer processes in the HMNPs–PQD composites. The Yb3+ is first excited by NIR (980 nm) excitation and then the energy is transferred to Tm3+ to obtain UC emission. These emission lights can be reabsorbed by PQDs due to the large absorption cross section. Therefore, the UC emission can be realized by photon emission through exciton recombination. TGA curves (Fig. 11d) showed that the loading amount of PQDs was 21%.

3.3 Dual-mode luminescent NaYF4:30%Yb3+,0.5%Tm3+/CsPbX3 for anti-counterfeiting
Through the above analysis of the PL and UC emission spectra, it can be concluded that the HMNPs–PQD composites can be simultaneously excited by routine UV light and NIR light. Fig. 12a shows the luminescent photos of solutions under visible, UV and NIR light irradiation. Benefiting from the dual-wavelength excitation characteristics of the composites, the promising application of anti-counterfeiting was proposed. To examine the applicability of the investigated composites in the anti-counterfeiting application, a letter pattern of “CIAC” was designed by using the HMNPs–PQD inks and handwritten them on paper. Then, these patterns were irradiated by different diverse excitation modes, such as visible light (Fig. 12b), 365 nm UV light (Fig. 12c), 980 nm NIR light (Fig. 12d) and concurrent UV light and 980 nm NIR laser (Fig. 12e). Obviously, the 2D-encoded patterns were almost invisible under normal visible light. When “CIAC” patterns were irradiated by 365 nm UV light or 980 nm NIR laser, it can be easily discerned by their emitting characteristic colors. Under the simultaneous irradiation of two excitation sources, 365 nm UV and 980 nm NIR light, the anti-counterfeiting information can be extracted. Its characteristic is that only two kinds of luminescent colors are completely correct to confirm the authenticity of anti-counterfeiting printing so that it is difficult to forge. The above results confirm that stable HMNPs–PQD composites have great potential in dual-model anti-counterfeiting application.

4. Conclusions
In summary, NaYF4:Yb/Tm@CsPbX3 (X = Cl0.5Br0.5, Br, Br0.5I0.5) nanocomposites with high luminescence and stability were successfully constructed by a simple hydrolysis-encapsulation strategy. Encapsulating PQDs in hollow mesoporous NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanoparticles (HMNPs) protects the structure from moisture or light and from anion exchange when mixing with different halide PQDs. Within the stable HMNPs, CsPbX3 PQDs showed outstanding stability against long-term storage in air and UV light. In addition, benefiting from the dual-wavelength excitation characteristics, the composites were applied to dual-mode anti-counterfeiting. This work not only provides a robust strategy for designing novel multimodal luminescence composites, but also sheds some light on the stabilization and applications of CsPbX3 PQDs.
