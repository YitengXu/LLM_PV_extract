1. Introduction
Rechargeable Li-ion batteries have found broad applications since first commercialized in the early 1990s by Sony,1 and are now being used for applications ranging from consumer electronics (such as laptops, cell phones, cameras, etc.) to electric vehicles and electrical grid storage.2–5 Li-ion batteries deliver and store energy through the reversible movement of Li+ ions between the cathode and anode across a porous separator. Li-ion batteries provide energy densities 2–3 times and power densities 5–6 times higher than Ni–MH, Ni–Cd, and Pb acid batteries, in addition to some other advantages such as long cycle life, low self-discharge, no memory effect, high operating voltage, and wide temperature window.6,7 Commonly, a Li-ion battery contains an anode (e.g., graphite), a cathode (e.g., LiCoO2), and an electrolyte-filled separator which allows Li+ ion transfer but prevents electrode contact, as shown in Fig. 1. When the battery is charged, Li+ ions deintercalate from the cathode and intercalate into the anode; while Li+ ions intercalate into the cathode during discharge through the electrolyte. Li+ ions transfer between the anode and the cathode during charge and discharge, enabling the conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy and the storage of electrochemical energy.8–10

The total energy stored in an electrode material is obviously an important factor, and can be quoted as the energy or the charges per unit mass (or specific energy, in W h kg−1), or energy per unit volume (energy density, in W h L−1). Emerging applications require batteries with greater than currently available energy densities, which have motivated numerous research efforts including investigations on high energy density anode and cathode materials, and engineered electrode structures which maximize capacity utilization and rate performance.11,12 Besides the optimization of battery package materials and the battery structure, what's more significant is developing high energy density anodes and cathodes. As for anodes, in Li-ion batteries they are usually composed of carbonaceous materials with a long lifespan and low cost, but capacity (theoretical capacity: 372 mA h g−1) and safety are the major issues. Many potential candidates have been investigated, such as Si, Sn, transition metal oxides, and so on.13 Particularly, Si anodes possess a very high capacity of 1000 to 4000 mA h g−1, making them quite attractive.14,15 However, their practical performance is far below the expectations because of the fast capacity fading even at low current rates. Compared to relatively high energy density anodes, cathodes commonly give poor energy density due to their low capacity and sometimes low voltage plateaus such as LiFePO4 cathodes.
Over the past few years, there have been many reports on high energy electrodes including both anode and cathode materials. Among them, graphene-based composites have attracted broad attention. Graphene is a favorite material for making composites, because it is an ideal substrate used for growing and anchoring insulating materials due to its high charge carrier mobility (20 m2 V−1 s−1), high theoretical surface area of 2630 m2 g−1, and a broad electrochemical window.16–18 With graphene in the electrode system, it has been demonstrated that the electron transportation (particularly important for cathodes) of the electrodes can be remarkably improved, which is quite significant to achieve high energy density, good cycling stability and rate performance.19 Conventional graphene-based composites are sheet-shaped pieces without a determined architecture, usually resulting in severe aggregation among nanocomposites. This is disadvantageous for Li+ ion and electrolyte diffusion, and more likely leads to poor structural strength of the electrodes.20
In contrast, three-dimensional (3D) graphene-based nanocomposites possess a defined stereostructure such as micro- or mesoporous architecture. Within these nanocomposites, there are different types of 3D graphene structures such as graphene foam,21–23 graphene aerogels,24–27 leavened graphene structures,28,29etc. Correspondingly, 3D graphene with different structures can be prepared through different approaches. 3D graphene foams are commonly prepared through chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using metals such as Ni as catalysts, while graphene aerogels are usually synthesized by freeze drying reduced graphene oxide hydrogels, which are assembled through a hydrothermal method. Among the different 3D graphene structures, CVD grown graphene foams usually possess less number of layers and show better conductivity compared to the hydrothermally assembled reduced graphene oxides; however, the relatively high cost and small yield of the CVD grown graphene foams remain a big challenge. Compared to two-dimensional (2D) graphene such as dispersive graphene sheets, which used to be embedded in the electrochemically active materials, 3D graphene is more capable of facilitating Li+ ion transfer and mass transportation. The 3D graphene-based nanocomposite electrode has been considered to be an efficient pathway for addressing the aggregation issues, showing high electrochemical performance including large capacity and energy density, stable cycling, and good rate performance.
There have been many reviews on rechargeable Li-ion batteries and graphene composites;30–34 however, there is lack of review focusing on 3D graphene-based nanocomposites for high energy density Li-ion batteries. The 3D graphene-based electrodes provide many specific advantages compared to the 2D ones. Energy density is particularly significant for emerging battery applications such as in electric vehicles. This review aims to meet this need by comprehensively summarizing the current challenges of high energy density Li-ion batteries, and recent progresses in the synthesis and electrochemical performance of 3D graphene-based composite electrodes including both anodes and cathodes with primary focus on the high energy density and 3D structure.
2. Challenges for high energy density Li-ion batteries
Since high energy density Li-ion batteries mainly involve large capacity and a high operating voltage, developing high-performance electrode materials and appropriate electrolytes is of great demand. Some of the reported full cell energy densities are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 2. The full cells consisting of nanostructured electrode materials show high energy densities, such as the full cell of Li3PO4-coated TiO2 II LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 nanowires; while graphene based conventional electrode materials also exhibit good energy density, such as the full cell of Fe3O4/graphene II 3D graphene, indicating a promising direction for developing 3D graphene nanocomposite electrodes.

Currently, high energy density Li-ion batteries still pose some challenges as presented below:
(i) For both the anode and cathode, increasing the capacity is significant to achieve high energy density under a determined voltage plateau. It has been reported that some nano-materials possess specifically high electrochemical activities which are beneficial for lithiation/delithiation and thereby improve the capacity. Due to the quantum confinement and boundary effects, small sized materials can present novel properties absent in bulk crystals while the nano-materials can provide a high surface area and short lithium-diffusion pathway.45 During the past decade, it was rather popular to improve the electrochemical performances of electrode materials by reducing the size to the nanoscale. Currently, a controllable and large-yield method for the synthesis of the optimally nanostructured anode and cathode is highly desired.
(ii) An appropriate voltage plateau is necessary for battery electrodes. To achieve high energy density of a full cell, the voltage of cathodes should be high while for anodes the voltage should be low. In recent years, Si and Sn anodes, on the basis of a typical alloy/de-alloy mechanism, have been of great interest due to their high capacities and low voltages. However, the huge volume change during charge and discharge (e.g., larger than 300% volume expansion for the Si anode during lithiation) makes the electrode quite unstable, leading to solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation which decays the capacity greatly. Many metal oxides suffer from a high voltage plateau and large hysteresis, both of which reduce the energy density and cycling life. As for the cathode, some high voltage cathode materials have been reported, nevertheless, the commonly poor electric conductivity and the degradation issue of the electrolyte under high voltage (e.g., larger than 4.5 V) restrict the application of high voltage cathodes.
(iii) The battery energy density under different working conditions changes a lot. For example, the poor low-temperature energy density would severely limit the battery application in winter and some low-temperature regions. Doping and fabrication of composites are efficient methods to improve the temperature-dependent energy density. Among the many achievements, taking the cathode as an instance, it has been demonstrated that doping Na, Mg, Al, F, Cr, etc., could replace some of the intrinsic ions within the cathode materials such as LiNixCoyMnzO2, LiFePO4, LiMn2O4, optimizing the atomic structure for Li+ ion intercalation/de-intercalation and electron transfer. Cooperation with graphene to form a composite has been extensively investigated because of the fascinating electrical and mechanical properties of graphene. Graphene can form a connected conductive structure without other auxiliary materials on the basis of its π–π stacking interactions. 3D graphene prevents the overlap of graphene sheets, provides pores for ion transport, and offers a low-density interconnected electrical conductive network. Hence, more recently, assembly of graphene-based composites into a 3D structure for enhancing the Li+ ion and electrolyte diffusion, electron transfer, and mechanical structure strength has been of great interest, which will be summarized below in more detail.
3. 3D graphene-based nanocomposite cathodes
3.1 3D graphene/LiFePO4 nanocomposites
The olivine LiFePO4, initially introduced as a cathode material for Li-ion batteries by Goodenough et al.,46 has been investigated extensively. Attractively, LiFePO4 possesses high theoretical capacity (170 mA h g−1), low toxicity, low manufacturing cost, good safety, environmental friendliness, and long cycling life.47–50 However, low electronic conductivity (10−9 to 10−10 S cm−2) and low diffusion of Li+ ions across the LiFePO4/FePO4 boundary of LiFePO4 lead to high impedance, low practical capacity and poor rate performance, which limit the practical use of LiFePO4 for electrical vehicles and hybrid electrical vehicles.51,52 Many efforts have been contributed to address those issues, including carbon coating, particle size reduction, metal doping, optimizing the morphology, etc.53–55
To enhance the electrochemical performance of LiFePO4 cathodes, graphene has been employed for making graphene/LiFePO4 nanocomposites due to the features of graphene such as superior conductivity, high mechanical strength, and structural flexibility. Previously, Ding et al. synthesized a graphene/LiFePO4 composite through a co-precipitation method, which showed improved electrochemical performance compared to the pristine LiFePO4.56 Sun et al. systematically compared the impact of stacked graphene and unfolded graphene used in a composite, as shown in Fig. 3.57 Fascinatingly, they found that the unfolded graphene enabled good dispersion of LiFePO4 and restricted the LiFePO4 particle size at the nanoscale which led to high electrochemical performance (Fig. 3d), indicating the advantages of 3D graphene compared to the planar graphene sheets. On the basis of the enhancement mechanism of 3D graphene, they further prepared a 3D hierarchical graphene/LiFePO4 composite cathode with a porous structure through a facile template-free sol–gel method.58 The 3D graphene integrated with LiFePO4 creates an effective electronically conducting network, resulting in a reversible capacity of 146 mA h g−1 at 17 mA g−1 over 100 cycles. From these findings, we can see that with a 3D graphene structure, the electron transfer and electrolyte diffusion can be significantly improved, which indicate a promising direction for high energy density electrode designs.

By using a similar sol–gel, Naik and co-workers prepared a 3D graphene/LiFePO4 nanocomposite in the presence of dispersed graphene oxide mixed with an LiFePO4 precursor.59 The electronic conductivity of graphene/LiFePO4 was found to be six orders of magnitude higher than that of pure LiFePO4 synthesized following the same procedure without graphene. At a charging rate of C/3, the capacity of the composite is about 160 mA h g−1, which is very close to the theoretical limit. In addition, the LiFePO4–graphene composite shows a dramatically improved rate capability up to 27C and excellent charge–discharge cycle stability over 500 cycles. A LiFePO4@C/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite has also been fabricated.60 The cooperation of LiFePO4 with a carbon coating and reduced graphene oxide produce an effective 3D conductive network. The nanocomposites showed no obvious capacity fading after 200 cycles at a current of 10C, while a discharge capacity of 119 mA h g−1 can be still delivered at 20C, suggesting a high electronic conductivity introduced by 3D graphene. The high rate performance of the 3D graphene oxide composite cathode would be promisingly applied in high energy density batteries for electric vehicles; however, the sol–gel method still remains a challenge for making particles with a small size and narrow size distribution.
In order to achieve a small particle size and well-controllable size distribution, a one-pot in situ hydrothermal method was developed for preparing a 3D graphene/LiFePO4 nanocomposite.61 The LiFePO4 nanoparticles (Fig. 4) are wrapped by graphene on 3D free-standing foam obtained from the self-assembly of graphene oxide. The nanocomposite which possesses a 3D conductive network can be directly used for the cathode without conductive carbon black, a binder or an aluminum current collector. The free-standing graphene/LiFePO4 nanocomposites exhibit a discharge capacity of 115 mA h g−1 at 10C. A binder-free composite cathode of reduced graphene/LiFePO4 was also fabricated through an electrophoresis strategy.62 The quasi-spherical LiFePO4 particles are uniformly wrapped by 3D networks of reduced graphene oxide. It is believed that their 3D graphene composite design could be generally applied to a variety of active material systems for both cathode and anode applications in high energy density Li-ion batteries.

Besides the LiFePO4 cathodes cooperating with pure 3D graphene mentioned above, the combination of a doped 3D graphene with LiFePO4 is also of great interest. A nanocomposite consisting of (010) facet-oriented LiFePO4 nanoplatelets wrapped in a nitrogen-doped 3D graphene aerogel has also been reported, as shown in Fig. 5.63 Such a nanocomposite possesses a 3D porous structure with a BET surface area of about 199.3 m2 g−1. The nitrogen-doped graphene aerogel combined with its interconnected porous networks provides pathways for rapid electron transfer and ion transport. The 3D graphene-based nanocomposites show a high rate capability (78 mA h g−1 at 100C) accompanied by long life cycling stability. The high rate capacity clearly shows that the interpenetrating meso- and macro-porous structures of 3D graphene provide efficient pathways for both Li+ ion and electron transfer; the agglomeration of graphene, which is common for graphene sheet-based nanocomposites, is effectively prevented by constructing a 3D porous structure; 3D graphene serves as a buffer to accommodate the structure change during lithiation–delithiation. In addition, graphene-based LiFePO4 nanocomposites with an attractive 3D structure have also been proved to be promising for fabricating high-performance flexible batteries.64 Since electrode strength is one of the key factors for flexible electronic devices such as batteries, 3D graphene with a porous structure would provide some new opportunities for flexible element construction.

3.2 3D graphene/LiNi1−x−yCoxMnyO2 nanocomposites
Recently, layer-structured ternary cathodes have been considered as promising cathode materials. Among the various investigated cathodes, the LiNi1−x−yCoxMnyO2 series such as LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (NCM) integrates the advantages of LiCoO2, LiNiO2, and LiMnO2.65 NCM possesses a high operating voltage, high specific capacity, cyclic stability, and structural stability. However, the poor electronic conductivity of NCM results in low electrochemical performance and limits its practical applications.
The use of graphene to form 3D composite materials has been demonstrated to improve the capacity, rate capability, and cyclic stability of NCM cathodes. NCM and its composite with graphene can be prepared by microemulsion and ball-milling techniques, hydrothermal synthesis, etc. It has been shown that the NCM/graphene composites exhibit high discharge capacity (188 mA h g−1), good rate capability, and good cycling performance compared to pure NCM.66 The improved electrochemical performance can be attributed to a decrease in the charge-transfer resistance. In addition, a free-standing Li2MnO3 NCM/reduced graphene oxide electrode has been prepared via an organic solvent-assisted freeze-drying method.67 The particles and reduced graphene oxide are well-combined and dispersed (Fig. 6), effectively avoiding capacity fading from the water-based method, since water can be fatal for batteries. The binder-free and current collector-free electrode shows lower polarization, leading to much better rate performance than pristine NCM. A high energy density of about 1050 W h kg−1 (on a cathode material mass basis) has been realized.

(d) High resolution TEM image of the composite. The reduced graphene oxide coating layer is indicated by the yellow dotted line.67 Copyright 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry. 
The effect of 3D graphene conducting networks on the kinetic properties of NCM nanocomposites can be demonstrated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and potentiostatic intermittent titration. It has been confirmed that the 3D graphene network greatly decreases the resistance of batteries, especially the charge transfer resistance.68 Additionally, in order to improve the combination between NCM and graphene, it has been demonstrated that the solvothermal route not only ensures high crystallinity of the NCM particles from pre-sintering, but also realizes the intimate coupling of graphene with NCM via covalent metal–oxygen bonds.69 Different from the solvothermal approach, the co-precipitation method has also been considered quite effective for the fabrication of 3D graphene/NCM composite cathodes, which efficiently extends the composite structure and the composition possibility,70,71 such as preparing the LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/graphene and LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2/graphene cathodes which are promising for developing high energy batteries applied in electric vehicles.
3.3 3D graphene/LiMn2O4 nanocomposites
Spinel lithium manganese oxide (LiMn2O4) has been considered as an alternative cathode material for commercial LiCoO2 in batteries, due to its abundant and cheaper resources, environmental benignity and better safety. However, LiMn2O4 suffers from severe capacity fading due to Mn dissolution into the electrolyte and Jahn–Teller distortion, and the low intrinsic conductivity. Carbon coating on some cathode materials such as LiFePO4, where the high conductivity carbon considerably enhances the rate capability, has been widely used. However, the carbon-coating layer is generally prepared by pyrolyzing an organic precursor under an inert atmosphere. It can hardly be applied to some other oxide cathodes such as Li(Ni, Co, Mn)O2 and LiMn2O4, because heat treatment under an inert atmosphere leads to oxygen loss, which deteriorates the structural integrity and electrochemical performance.
Hence, graphene has been considered for enhancing the electrochemical performance of LiMn2O4. Previously, 2D graphene nanosheets were directly used as a type of planar conductive additive in spinel LiMn2O4-based electrodes, to improve the electronic conductivity. It was confirmed that the specific capacity was obviously enhanced when graphene nanosheets co-existed with acetylene black.72 In addition, LiMn2O4/graphene nanosheet composites can also be synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal method without post-heat treatment.73 However, the combination between 2D graphene nanosheets and LiMn2O4 can hardly be uniform, which results in poor repeatability and controllability.
Accordingly, 3D graphene has been introduced into the LiMn2O4 system in recent years. Composites of LiMn2O4 nanoparticles in a 3D graphene matrix have been prepared to address the low electronic conductivity issue of the LiMn2O4 cathode.74 The 3D graphene/LiMn2O4 electrode shows higher discharge capacity and rate capability than the pristine LiMn2O4 electrode, which is attributed to the high surface area of LiMn2O4 nanoparticles and good electronic conductivity of graphene. In addition to the 3D graphene foam, some compensating materials such as ZnO75 and Y2O3 (ref. 76) have also been introduced to the nanocomposite systems. So far, the enhancement mechanism is still unclear; however, commonly it is suspected that the oxide coatings could be responsible for the improved cycling performance by suppressing Mn3+ dissolution, while the graphene could enhance the conductivity of LiMn2O4 and thus improve the high capability and energy density. Further investigations on the improvement mechanism will be significant.
3.4 3D graphene/V2O5 nanocomposites
Layered metal oxides/sulfates, such as V2O5, MoO3, and MoS2 with strong interlayer covalent bonding and weak van der Waals coupling between layers, have been considered as Li-ion battery cathode candidates.77–80 Commonly, the increase of cathode capacity requires multi-electron insertion and extraction reactions; however, so far, most of the cathode materials have only reversibly accepted one electron and delivered capacities lower than 200 mA h g−1. V2O5 is a typical intercalation compound, due to its semiconductivity and layered structure. It has attracted intensive research for many decades in the investigation of its structure, properties, and technological applications such as lithium batteries and electrochromic displays.81–83 V2O5 can capture multiple electrons and gives a high capacity of 294 mA h g−1 in a voltage range of 2 to 4 V (vs. Li/Li+),84,85 accompanied by some other advantages such as low cost and high abundance. Nevertheless, similar to most of the other cathode materials, V2O5 suffers from poor cycling stability and rate capability because of its low Li+ ion diffusion coefficient (∼10−12 cm2 s−1) and electrical conductivity (10−4 to 10−5 S cm−2).86
Hence, fabricating 3D nanocomposites between graphene and V2O5 has been demonstrated to be promising for the improvement of Li+ ion diffusion and electrical conductivity. Previously, Fan et al. have shown a lightweight and freestanding V2O5 nanoarray-based cathode prepared by growing a V2O5 nanobelt array on 3D graphite foam, followed by coating the V2O5 with a mesoporous thin layer of the conducting polymer.87 This integrated electrode exhibits ultrafast and stable electrochemical performance including high specific capacities of 265 mA h g−1 at 5C and 168 mA h g−1 at 60C, respectively, accompanied by a capacity retention of about 98% up to 1000 cycles. More importantly, the 3D composites exhibit an energy density of about 238 W h kg−1 at a power rate of 23 kW kg−1, much exceeding that of other reported V2O5 related cathodes.88–90
Recently, our group reported a Li-ion battery cathode concept, consisting of an integrated 3D mesostructure of electrochemically active materials V2O5 and graphene, which provides a significantly greater active material loading than most of the other 3D structured electrode concepts.91 In the 3D graphene/V2O5 nanocomposite cathode, an electrically conductive 4–10 layer thick graphene was embedded between two 60 nm-thick V2O5, as shown in Fig. 7. We prepared this 3D nanocomposite starting from a polystyrene opal templated electrodeposited Ni inverse opal. Through chemical vapor deposition, graphene was grown on the Ni scaffold. A first layer of V2O5 was then grown onto the 3D graphene-coated Ni. After the Ni scaffold was etched, another V2O5 layer was coated onto the inner layer of graphene, forming a 3D sandwich nanocomposite.

The 3D graphene/V2O5 nanocomposites provide a path for Li-ion battery cathode with high capacities, long cycling lives, and good rate performances. In Fig. 8, the full electrode basis capacity is ca. 230 mA h g−1 at 5C after 200 cycles, which, versus a graphite anode, would provide an energy density of about 633 W h kg−1. After 200 cycles, the cathode exhibits a volumetric capacity of ∼223 mA h cm−3, which is expected to provide a volumetric energy density of about 613 W h L−1.92,93 The freestanding 3D structure would stimulate a possibility for practically making electrodes without the necessity of additives such as binders and conducting agents.

3.5 3D graphene/lithium metal silicate and other phosphate nanomaterials
Li2MSiO4 (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni),94,95 as a class of cathode materials for Li-ion batteries, have been widely investigated. In particular, Li2MnSiO4 is attractive among the Li2MSiO4 family because of its high voltage (Mn2+/Mn3+ and Mn3+/Mn4+) and high theoretical capacity of 333 mA h g−1; however, the low electronic conductivity and slow diffusion of Li+ ions has prevented its practical applications.96,97 Usually, the decrease of particle size accompanying coating of carbon is an effective way to overcome these drawbacks and improve the electrochemical performance. The mixed carbon source is also used to improve the cycling stability of Li2MnSiO4.98,99 With the mixed carbon sources, a spherical Li2MnSiO4/C/graphene nanocomposite was prepared through a solid-state reaction using SiO2 as the precursor.100 The 3D Li2MnSiO4/C/graphene nanocomposites show a first discharge capacity of 215.3 mA h g−1 under 0.05C, and a stable discharge capacity of 175 mA h g−1 over 40 cycles. Zhang's group synthesized a 3D macroporous graphene-based Li2FeSiO4 composite as the cathode material for lithium-ion batteries, as shown in Fig. 9.101 The 3D graphene-based nanocomposites exhibit discharge capacities of 313, 255, 215, 180, 150, and 108 mA h g−1 at the charge–discharge rates of 0.1C, 1C, 2C, 5C, 10C, and 20C, respectively, which are much better compared to the 2D composites and Li2FeSiO4/C. These findings indicate that the 3D macroporous graphene provides higher accessible surface area for the nanoparticles in the composites, and allows the electrolyte ions to diffuse inside and through the 3D network of the cathode, which is quite significant for the solar cells and electrochemical sensors as well.

In addition, a 3D LiMn0.75Fe0.25PO4/reduced graphene oxide was prepared by one-step salt-assisted spray drying using a mixed solution containing a precursor salt and graphene oxide and a subsequent heat treatment.102 The composite showed high tap density (1.1 g cm−3), gravimetric capacity of 161 mA h g−1 and volumetric capacity of 281 mA h cm−3 at 0.05C. Interestingly, it also exhibited excellent rate capability, providing a discharge capacity of 90 mA h g−1 at a high rate of 60C, which could be ascribed to the 3D structure consisting of nanoparticles integrated with graphene, and the porous nature of the material. A reduced graphene oxide/carbon double-coated LiMn0.9Mg0.1PO4 was also demonstrated as a cathode with excellent rate performance.103 The double coating of graphene and carbon brings the unique advantages of the conformal carbon layer on each LiMn0.9Mg0.1PO4 particle surface, providing short pathways for electron transfer. Cui and co-workers synthesized a graphene and carbon nanotube co-modified Li3V2(PO4)3/C composite for the first time through a hydrothermal-assisted sol–gel route, as illustrated in Fig. 10.104 Both carbon additives including graphene and carbon nanotubes have interlaced to form a cross-linked 3D conductive network, resulting in the composite exhibiting high rate performance and long cycle stability. The discharge capacity is 147.5 mA h g−1 at 20C; while the capacity retention is 82.7% over 2000 cycles. In these cases, combination with graphene and some other carbon resources like graphite and nanotubes has resulted in much enhanced electrochemical performance, which would be a potential idea for active material modification.

3.6 3D graphene/organic nanocomposites
Current inorganic electrode materials are mainly based on costly transition metals, which will become one of the big obstacles for the large-scale application of Li-ion batteries. Hence, it is significant to develop low-cost electrode materials to meet the demands of the booming electric vehicle industry and other energy storage applications.105,106 Abundant resources and the advantages of chemical diversity and tunable redox properties enable organic electrode materials as promising candidates for Li-ion batteries.107,108 Organic materials change the mechanism of Li storage from intercalation to chemical bond reactions.109,110 Conducting polymers, organic sulfur compounds, organic carbonyl compounds, etc., have been investigated as electrode active materials in recent years.111–115 However, the intrinsic defects of many organic polymers such as severe dissolution and poor charge transfer remain a great challenge.116
In order to explore high-performance polymers, the p-conjugated poly(1,5-diaminoanthraquinone), which hybridizes a couple of polyaniline backbones with the electroactive 1,4-benzoquinone moiety for a four-electron transfer per structural unit, has been shown to possess high theoretical capacity (454 mA h g−1).117,118 Recently, some authors reported a 3D graphene/acid-treated multi-walled carbon nanotubes-supported 1,5-diaminoanthraquinone organic nanocomposites synthesized by an organic solvent displacement method subsequently combining with a solvothermal reaction.119 The nanocomposites exhibit a high discharge capacity of 289 mA h g−1 at 30 mA g−1 and retain 122 mA h g−1 at an extreme current density of 10 A g−1. More importantly, excellent cycling stability is obtained with only 14.8% capacity loss after 2000 cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1.
Very recently, since 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride possesses a much larger theoretical capacity (273 mA h g−1) than olivine LiFePO4 (170 mA h g−1),120,121 a 3D graphene/3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride composite has been prepared through a simple heat-treatment process at different temperatures, as shown in Fig. 11.122 When cycled versus lithium in the potential range of 1.5 to 4.6 V, the 3D composites exhibit a discharge capacity of 172 mA h g−1 at the 180th cycle. In addition, 3D graphene/organic composites possess another fascinating feature, which is that they are quite appropriate for fabricating flexible batteries. As is well known, flexible batteries are important for application in flexible electronic devices. A 3D graphene conductive network-based polyimide cathode (Fig. 12) has been successfully fabricated, which exhibits a capacity of 175 mA h g−1 and high rate performance.123 After 150 cycles at 0.5C, 82% of the initial capacity was retained, indicating the potential of 3D graphene/organic composites applied for flexible Li-ion batteries. Some representative 3D graphene-based composite cathodes indicated above have been summarized in Table 2. Next, how to make a hybrid electrode with good compatibility between the organic component and graphene or electrochemically active materials remains a challenge. Therefore, specific molecular structure design and surface chemistry become particularly important.

4. 3D graphene-based nanocomposite anodes
4.1 3D graphene/Si or Ge nanocomposites
Electrode materials are the key components that dominate the electrochemical properties of a battery, thus various electrochemically active materials with high capacity have been tested for replacing graphite that has a theoretical capacity of only 372 mA h g−1 and that is now used in commercial Li-ion batteries.124,125 Silicon (Si) is of great interest for high energy density battery anodes owing to its ultrahigh theoretical capacity (4200 mA h g−1), low voltage plateau, abundance and low cost.126,127 However, Si exhibits a huge volume change during lithiation–delithiation which causes fracture of the Si anodes and thus rapid capacity decay. Graphene encapsulated Si nanoparticles have been obtained by mixing an aqueous suspension of poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) modified Si nanoparticles with a graphene oxide suspension.128 After encapsulation, the SiO2 on the surface of the Si nanoparticles was etched, forming a 3D Si/graphene/graphite nanocomposite. The full-electrode basis gravimetric capacity was 983 mA h g−1 at the first cycle and 370 mA h g−1 was retained after 100 cycles for a Si loading density of 1.5 mg cm−2, far exceeding that of graphite with a capacity of 244 mA h g−1.
Recently, our group has fabricated a 3D graphene/Si nanocomposite through a template method combining chemical vapor deposition, as shown in Fig. 13.91 Within this composite, Si was coated by graphene on both sides, forming a graphene@Si@graphene sandwich structure, as shown in Fig. 14. We found that after 200 cycles at a rate of 0.4C, the discharge and charge capacities were ca. 2515 and 2475 mA h g−1, respectively, about six times of the theoretical capacity of a graphite anode,129 accompanied by a coulombic efficiency stable at about 98%. The good performance is ascribed to both the graphene coatings which improve the electronic conductivity and perhaps protect the SEI from damage during lithiation–delithiation, and the porous structure which provides space for the volume expansion of Si during lithiation.

Germanium (Ge), as another metallic element in group IV based on the alloy/de-alloy mechanism, has received increasing attention besides Si.130,131 Ge possesses 400 times higher diffusivity of Li+ ion at room-temperature and ca. 100 times higher electrical conductivity compared to Si. The theoretical capacity of Ge is 1600 mA h g−1 (4.4 Li+ ions per Ge atom).132–134 However, similar to Si anodes, the volume change during alloying/de-alloying is high (∼370%). To address this issue, a 3D Ge/graphene nanocomposite was fabricated by a one-step, in situ, and aqueous-based route.135 The 3D nanocomposite (Fig. 15) exhibited more stable cycling performance than pure Ge, with a capacity of ca. 832 mA h g−1 over 50 cycles. Similar to the enhancement mechanism of 3D graphene toward cathodes, it is able to provide good conductivity, enable numerous sites to allow dispersion of the Ge nanoparticles without excessive agglomeration, as well as give free spaces to accommodate the volume change during cycling.

4.2 3D graphene/Li4Ti5O12 nanocomposites
Li4Ti5O12 has received broad attention as a promising anode material candidate because of its excellent Li-ion insertion/extraction reversibility with zero structural change and a relatively higher operating voltage (1.55 V vs. Li/Li+) to ensure battery safety.136 The relative high potential plateau can avoid high resistances from the reduction of electrolytes (SEI formation) and also suppress metallic lithium deposition on the surface of the anode.
However, there are some intrinsic issues to be addressed for realistic applications, such as the poor electrical conductivity (<10−13 S cm−1) and the low lithium ion diffusion efficiency (10−9 to 10−16 cm2 s−1). Fabricating graphene-supported Li4Ti5O12 nanocomposites has been considered effective to address the issues. A Li4Ti5O12/N-doped reduced graphene oxide composite has been proposed using a dual functional nitrogen doping source to prevent graphene restacking and achieve uniform nitrogen doping to increase the conductivity.137 It has been shown that when the nitrogen content is 2.3 wt%, the electronic conductivity of the composite increases to 1.60 S cm−1, showing significant enhancement for practical applications.
Graphene modified Li4Ti5O12 composites can also be prepared via a sol–gel assisted molten salt process.138 It was found that the charge transfer resistance at the Li4Ti5O12 active substance/electrolyte interface can be reduced from 316.9 to 151.8 Ω by graphene, showing much improved electrochemical performance compared to the pure and carbon-coated Li4Ti5O12 (Fig. 16). Through this approach, Li4Ti5O12 has a decreased particle size, and the aggregation and agglomeration of primary particles is effectively avoided. Graphene leads to the most uniform particle size distribution of Li4Ti5O12, and enhances the conductivity between the adjacent particles.

Through a similar sol–gel method, a Li4Ti5O12/graphene composite with an average Li4Ti5O12 particle size of approximately 200–500 nm has been prepared recently.139 The resulting nanocomposite demonstrates remarkable rate capability that it delivers a reversible capacity of 108.4 mA h g−1 in the 1000th cycle at a 10C charge–discharge rate, about 2.5 times that of pristine Li4Ti5O12 particles (44.1 mA h g−1). In addition, a series of efforts have been contributed to the Li4Ti5O12/3D graphene composites, which commonly show significant achievements in both high capacity and good rate performance.140 From these progresses, it is believed that the Li4Ti5O12/graphene composites could be an efficient pathway for accelerating the real applications of Li4Ti5O12 anodes.
4.3 3D graphene/metal oxide nanocomposites
Transition metal oxides have been widely investigated as alternative electrode materials for Li-ion batteries due to their high theoretical specific capacities compared with the commercially used graphite anodes (372 mA h g−1).141–144 So far, the electrochemical properties of quite a few transition metal oxide-based materials have been studied as the anode material for batteries. SnO2 anodes have attracted enormous attention because of the high theoretical capacity of SnO2 (∼1494 mA h g−1).145,146 A 3D cross-linked graphene as the template to load SnO2 has been reported.147 The 3D nanocomposites provide good cycling stability with a reversible capacity of about 1096 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles at 1 A g−1. Impressively, the capacity remains at about 610 mA h g−1 at a high current density of 5 A g−1, which could be ascribed to the 3D graphene that facilitates Li+ ion transfer while keeping the overall electrode structure stable without obvious volume change.
Recently, a 3D composite of fluorine-doped SnO2 and reduced graphene oxide was prepared for the first time using Sn(BF4) as the Sn source, through a hydrothermal process.148 The authors demonstrated that the doping of F resulted in more uniform and higher loading of the F-SnO2 nanoparticles on the surfaces of graphene, and enhanced the electron transfer and Li+ ion diffusion in the composites, as shown in Fig. 17. The 3D nanocomposites show a high capacity of 1277 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. Such a high performance is ascribed to the enhanced electron transportation and Li+ ion diffusion due to F doping and the 3D porous graphene structure. It has been confirmed that after annealing, the formation of Sn–C–O bonds between the SnO2 nanoparticles and the reduced graphene sheets initiated a synergistic effect and improved the electrochemical performance.149 Even though the cooperation between SnO2 and graphene leads to a high electrochemical performance of SnO2, the limited theoretical capacity and intrinsic structure make it hard to achieve an ideal energy density property for practical applications.

Different from the graphene cooperating with a single SnO2 component, a 3D graphene foam encapsulated with hollow SnO2@Co3O4 spheres was proposed.150 The 3D nanocomposites give a first reversible discharge capacity of ca. 2372.4 mA h g−1 at a current density of 200 mA g−1. After 100 cycles, the capacity of 3D nanocomposites remains at about 815.2 mA h g−1 which is much better compared to the one without graphene. The good electrochemical performance could be attributed to the 3D graphene with highly conductive networks and porous architecture as well as the flexible buffering matrix for accommodating volume change. As the volume expansion is a big challenge for most of the high capacity anodes, a flexible 3D graphene nanocomposite structure provides a promising pathway for addressing this issue efficiently.
Among the many metal oxides, cobalt oxides (such as CoO and Co3O4) have been extensively investigated because of their good Li+ storage capacity and highly reversible electrochemical reactions. However, severe aggregation and large volume change of particles occur during the Li+ insertion/extraction process, thereby limiting its application for energy storage systems. Recently, researchers confirmed that the 3D graphene hydrogel anchored with a CoO nanoparticle composite can prevent the aggregation of CoO nanoparticles because these nanoparticles are encapsulated within the 3D graphene hydrogel,151 showing a potential opportunity for improving the electrochemical performance of cobalt oxides.
On the basis of this idea, a flexible integrated electrode has been proposed consisting of layer-by-layer packed graphene sheets entrapped SnO2–Co3O4 nanocubes, as shown in Fig. 18.152 The reversible capacity is 1665 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1, which can be ascribed to the rationally selected composition, polyhedral nanostructures, and a synergistic lithium storage effect.

Since the porous graphene structure is favorable for ion transfer, 3D porous Co3O4 nanocomposites have been proposed. Graphene-coated porous cobalt oxide fibers using coordination polymers as precursors through calcination followed by a subsequent self-assembly process exhibit remarkable electrochemical performances, including high specific capacity (1303.9 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1) and excellent cycling stability (1153 mA h g−1 retention after 80 cycles at a current density of 0.2 A g−1).153 The graphene-coated porous cobalt oxide fiber provides good conductivity, and prevents the aggregation and volume change of the Co3O4 nanoparticles during lithiation–delithiation. Different from the hydrothermal/solvothermal routes, graphene-coated Co3O4 nanostructures (Fig. 19)154 and the sandwich-like 3D Co3O4/graphene hybrids can be prepared by the electrostatic self-assembly,155 which greatly extends the fabrication strategies of 3D Co3O4/graphene composites for future investigation. For example, this route may be applicable for preparing CoCO3/graphene composites.156 Previously, cobalt carbonate nanoneedles and 3D porous graphene aerogel (CoCO3/graphene) were in situ synthesized based on a hydrothermal route followed by freeze-drying,157 which are considered the best among similar composite anodes consisting of CoCO3 or Co3O4 active particles.

Iron oxides are attractive due to their abundance, low cost, environmental benignity, high theoretical capacity (1005 mA h g−1 for Fe2O3), good safety, and long cycling life.158,159 A 3D α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles anchored graphene aerogel composite has been assembled by a hydrothermal method.160 It was found that the Fe2O3 nanoparticles were uniformly embedded into the 3D networks of graphene aerogels. A freestanding, flexible, paper-like Fe2O3/graphene/carbon nanotubes ternary composite with a 3D hierarchical structure was prepared through a simple filtration and a subsequent reduction process.161 The layered graphene/carbon nanotubes network not only withstands the huge stresses caused by Fe2O3 expansion/extraction but also prevents the agglomeration of Fe2O3 upon charging/discharging. The 3D nanocomposites exhibit a high reversible capacity of 716 mA h g−1 after 120 cycles at 50 mA g−1.
In order to achieve higher energy density, Chen et al. constructed a special supercapacitor-battery hybrid which combined an electrochemical double layer capacitance cathode with a Li-ion battery anode, as illustrated in Fig. 20.162 They fabricated a 3D Fe3O4 nanoparticle/graphene composite anode through a facile route including solvothermal reaction and heat treatment. The Fe3O4/graphene//graphene hybrid system exhibits energy densities of 204 to 65 W h kg−1 over power densities from 55 to 4600 W kg−1. The attractive energy density of the hybrid system could be ascribed to both the graphene-enhanced high-performance electrode materials. In addition to the 3D graphene/iron oxides mentioned above, graphene cooperated with some other oxides forming 3D nanocomposite anodes has also been of interest, such as a 3D porous graphene/carbon nanotubes/CuO hybrid aerogel163 and a bamboo-like WO3 nanorods-anchored 3D nitrogen-doped graphene composite,164 which exhibit remarkably enhanced electrochemical performance applicable for high energy density batteries. It shows that the 3D graphene structure is quite general for cooperating with broad anode materials, and thus improving the electrochemical performance by enhancing the structure strength during lithiation/delithiation and providing channels for electron and Li+ ion transportation.

Spinel nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4), which possesses the advantages of high theoretical capacitance/capacity, intriguing electronic conductivity, easy-preparation, abundant resources and environmental friendliness, has been widely studied.165 However, it suffers from low power densities and unstable cycling performance. The nanocomposites consisting of NiCo2O4 and graphene have attracted extensive attention. Mesoporous NiCo2O4 nanoneedles grown on 3D graphene networks have been prepared by the combination of a solvothermal reaction and subsequent annealing treatment.166 The nanocomposite anode exhibits high specific discharge capacity as well as superior cycling stability up to 2000 cycles. The 3D graphene based electrode is considered more desirable than powder nanostructures in terms of shorter Li+ ion diffusion and electron transfer paths, good strain accommodation, better interfacial/chemical distributions and high electrical conductivity. Commonly, NiCo2O4 nanostructures are deposited on reduced graphene oxide through a hydrothermal method, which ensures a dense coating and high material loading.
Another effective fabrication approach is directly growing NiCo2O4 and graphene onto 3D substrates such as Ni foam.167 Nickel–cobalt ions are chemically bonded with negatively charged graphene oxide sheets via electrostatic interaction, forming a nanocomposite system. Recently, graphene-based NiCo2O4 nanosheet arrays have been directly grown on nickel foam, which show significantly improved lithium storage properties with higher reversible capacity and better cycling stability than NiCo2O4 nanosheets, showing a potentially new strategy for structure-robust 3D nanocomposite electrode fabrication.
4.4 3D graphene/sulfide nanocomposites
Layered 2D materials have attracted increasing attention due to their high theoretical capacity, such as MoS2 (670 mA h g−1),168 SnS2 (645 mA h g−1),169 and WS2 (433 mA h g−1).170 For most of the sulfide electrode materials, the large volume changes and accompanying sharp decrease in capacity during cycling can hardly be avoided. Among them, MoS2 shows many advantageous features when used as an anode, such as a volume expansion of only 103% during lithiation.171 However, MoS2 has low electric conductivity and often suffers from poor rate performance and cycling stability.
Application of 3D porous graphene has been proved to be an effective way to enhance the rate performances and cycling stabilities, because 3D graphene provides not only channels for fast ion transport, but also high electric conductivity via the interconnected graphene network. 3D MoS2/vertical graphene can be easily constructed on various substrates including Ni foam and graphite paper, which exhibit a capacity of 1277 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 and a high first-cycle coulombic efficiency of 76.6%.172 Besides, a 3D porous composite with the MoS2 nanostructure on graphene for Li-ion batteries and hybrid supercapacitors has been prepared through a simple solution-process approach, as shown in Fig. 21.173 The 3D composite shows significantly enhanced electrochemical performance due to the synergistic effects of the conductive graphene sheets and the porous structure. The 3D anode exhibits a high energy density of 156 W h kg−1 at 197 W kg−1, which remains at 97 W h kg−1 even at a power density of 8314 W kg−1 with a stable cycling life.

In addition, He and co-workers reported a 3D hierarchically structured aerogel consisting of ultrathin layered MoS2/graphene nanosheets prepared via a hydrothermal route, which retained a capacity of 870 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 200 cycles.174 Some other important sulfides like VS4 and SnS2 have also been cooperated with 3D graphene forming high-performance anode nanocomposites. 3D VS4/reduced graphene oxide hierarchical architecture with VS4 particles wrapped by graphene nanosheets can be fabricated via a hydrothermal process, which exhibited a high capacity of 1044.2 mA h g−1 (close to the theoretical capacity of 1196 mA h g−1) and retained 890.8 mA h g−1 after 80 cycles at 0.2 A g−1.175 Through a similar route, SnS2 nanoflakes anchored 3D graphene foam as a flexible Li-ion battery anode has also been prepared successfully.176 The 3D graphene/SnS2 composites show a high specific capacity of 1386.7 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and a long cycling life with a high capacity of 818.4 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 1 mA g−1. The high performances can be ascribed to the reduced strain during intercalation/extraction, shortened Li+ ion transfer pathway, higher conductivity and more electrode/electrolyte contact area, indicating a promising direction for developing high rate performance 3D graphene composite anodes.
4.5 3D graphene/alloy nanocomposites
Tin possesses a high theoretical capacity (994 mA h g−1), and tin based anodes have been investigated as the alternative to carbonaceous materials. However, the critical issue of large volume change during Li insertion and extraction would lead to partial electrode pulverization and cracking.177 To minimize such a detrimental effect, various tin–cobalt based materials such as Sn–Co alloys and their graphene composites have attracted great attention for their improved mechanical stability and electrochemical properties.
Recently, graphene wrapped Sn–Co alloy nanoparticles have been prepared by a chemical reduction method on an ice water bath.178 A high capacity of 922 mA h g−1 is retained with a more stable cycle life than that at a small current. These improved cycling performances are attributed to the complementary effect of the three elements. The mechanical stability of Sn upon cycling is improved by the presence of robust and electrically conductive graphene and the alleviated function of the inactive cobalt element. Through a co-precipitation method, Sn–Co/graphene composites can also be synthesized.179 The improved lithium storage capability can be ascribed to the positive synergistic effect of the combination of the buffering effects of cobalt and the excellent conductivity of graphene, which restrains the volume variation, keeps the structure stable, and increases the conductivity of the composite. Among these high-performance alloy/graphene composites, 3D graphene would be a particularly ideal element for alloy anode composites which undergo a large volume change during cycling. Some typical 3D graphene-based composite anodes have been summarized in Table 3.

5. Conclusions and perspectives
High energy density Li-ion batteries which have broad applications have been considered significant in the energy storage field. Great efforts focused on 3D graphene-based composite electrodes for developing high-performance batteries with a large energy density, high capacity, and good rate have been summarized in this review. Current major challenges are provided including optimizing the structure and size of electrode materials such as 3D graphene-based cathode and anode nanocomposites, developing high voltage cathode and low voltage anode materials with good capacity, ability, and safety, as well as compatible battery electrolytes. In addition, we have presented in more detail the recent research progresses of electrode nanocomposites consisting of 3D graphene and electrochemically active materials such as graphene cooperated with LiFePO4, V2O5, and Li2MnSiO4 as cathodes, as well as graphene/Si, Ge, metal oxides, and sulfides as anodes. It has been broadly demonstrated that the 3D graphene within the nanocomposites is able to provide a conductive 3D network, improve the Li+ ion and charge transfer, and accommodate the structure and volume change during lithiation–delithiation.
With the significant achievements partly mentioned in the review, it is reasonably believed that the emerging Li-ion batteries with a much higher energy density than ever before are quite promising. The following research directions would be attractive for developing next generation high energy density batteries: the preparation of 3D graphene-based battery/supercapacitor hybrid devices; 3D graphene cooperating with high voltage cathode materials including LiNi1−x−yCoxMnyO2 (such as LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2), LiNi(1−x−y)CoxAlyO2 (such as LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2) and LiMn2O4, as well as with Li4Ti5O12, Co3O4/CoCO3, NiCo2O4, and Sn/Co anodes; for practical applications, increasing the tap density and high- and low-temperature capacity performance of electrode materials; a well compatible electrolyte to match the electrode system, especially for the system working at a high voltage. We hope this review would inspire some new ideas for global researchers and engineers to develop high energy density batteries, as well as demonstrate some new findings in materials chemistry and electrochemistry for energy storage and conversion.
