    , Accepted 14th March 2021First published on 15th March 2021AbstractFor the attenuation of CO2, a prominent greenhouse gas, nanostructured copper has been proven to be a paragon in electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR), and is an attractive and green approach to obtain value-added products. In this review, firstly, the fundamentals of ECR, its challenges and advantages are summarised, which may help newcomers in this field to understand the reduction process. Cu has gained much attention in ECR due to its unique advantages for the production of hydrocarbon compared to other pure metallic electrocatalysts. Therefore, focusing on Cu, a comprehensive overview of the recent research specifically related to copper foam (Cuf) and Cuf-based bimetallic nanocatalysts is summarised. Together with challenges, different research directions for the enhancement of the activity and selectivity of Cuf-based electrocatalysts and efficient conversion of CO2 to reusable forms of carbon for practical applications are proposed.
1. Introduction
CO2 is one of the important trace gases (0.035%) in the atmosphere and plays a crucial role in the carbon cycle.1,2 This biogeochemical cycle always works in equilibrium at a global level, but a huge imbalance in the carbon cycle has occurred due to the excess extraction of fossil fuels from their sources and then deposition of their futile by-products into sinks. This is accompanied by the rampant emission of CO2 gas in the atmosphere, leading to a rise in the Earth's temperature, and eventually, the amplification of global warming.3,4 The level of CO2 has crossed the threshold value of 350 ppm and reached its peak of 416.21 ppm in April 2020.5 Thus, there is an immediate need to solve these two prime issues, the depletion of fossil fuels and the rise in global warming due to increase in CO2 levels6,7 through CO2 capture and storage. For decades, colossal efforts have been focused on the conversion of CO2 to carbonaceous reusable forms, which can compensate for the dependence on fossil fuels and can also help establish a sustainable society. This can be executed via thermocatalysis,8,9 electrocatalysis,10–12 biocatalysis13,14 and photocatalysis.15,16 Recently, the electrochemical transformation of CO2 has gained significant interest as it can be carried out at ambient temperature and pressure with appreciable conversion efficiency and desirable products can be obtained by optimizing the experimental conditions such as choice of electrocatalyst, applied potential, and electrolyte. However, this does not simplify the ECR process due to its multiple electron-proton transfer steps and strong surface structure sensitivity. Accordingly, appropriate electrocatalysts that not only minimize the overpotential of the ECR process but also favour CO2 reduction over the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by proper adsorption of gaseous reactants and desorption of the reaction products are required. In this regard, the choice of heterogeneous catalysts such as Au,17–19 Ag,20,21 Pt,22,23 Cu, Sn,24–26 Zn,27,28 and Pd29,30 in the form of nanostructures or nanostructures supported on carbonaceous materials have been widely explored. Copper is a well-known catalyst for the conversion of CO2 to renewable fuels such as hydrocarbons and alcohols, but with a higher overpotential of more than 1 V. There are numerous reports in the literature summarizing the different forms of copper such as copper nanoparticles, nanowires, nanocubes and nanofoams for the successful reduction of CO2 into the mixture of a few major and minors products such as CO, methane, methanol formaldehyde, formic acid, ethanol, ethylene and higher hydrocarbons.31–34 Also, mixed CuO-based composites such as CuO–CeO2,35 CuO–In2O3,36 and CuO–Sb2O3 (ref. 37) have been proven to be highly active for ECR due to the strong interaction between CuO and other metal oxides. Some reviews in the literature mentioned the advantages of homogeneous38,39 and heterogeneous40,41 electrocatalysts used in ECR. However, in contrast to the reviews on heterogeneous catalysts for ECR (reviews on Cu-based electrocatalysts,41–43 review on Cu-based binary alloy,44 review on the mechanism of ECR on Cu-based electrode45), our review focuses on Cuf and Cuf-derived electrocatalysts, which have attracted significant attention in recent times due to their unique structure, porosity and large surface area. Cuf-based electrocatalysts have shown high efficiency with a low overpotential and good product selectivity. It is very important to summarize the structures and product selectivity of catalysts and their impact to reduce the overpotential; however, to the best of our knowledge, no review article on this topic exists in the literature. Thus, this review is an effort to identify the gap and produce a tutorial guide on the morphology and structural variation of Cuf and its derivative catalysts, highlighting their unique ability and control over the formation of the product, as presented in Fig. 1.

2. Carbon cycle and CO2 recycling: motivation and strategy
The uncontrollable increase in CO2 flux into the Earth's atmosphere has made it impossible for it to be balanced by natural carbon sinks, leading to an increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the environment, which is a hazard to air quality, human health and energy security.46 Therefore, researchers have been motivated to reduce CO2 to value-added products to counteract this major problem. The natural and low-cost methods for the capture of CO2 such as reforestation and soil amendment present a problem of land and water requirement for CO2 fixation. Furthermore, the slow rate and energy loss of the natural photosynthesis process limit plant-based approaches. Therefore, three main strategies, namely, decarbonisation, carbon sequestration and carbon recycling, have been employed by the researchers to reduce CO2 emissions. Decarbonisation means decoupling from energy consumption and also from CO2 emissions. In this case, electricity from renewable sources is a good alternative to burning fossil fuels, but even then, during the production of cement, steel, plastic, NH3, etc. in industries, non-energy carbon is used. Thus, if the energy is fully decarbonised there will be a continuous feed of carbon from these industries to the atmosphere. Carbon sequestration involves the acceptance of a limited net CO2 production but its release into the environment is prevented. However, although it provides optimistic projection, it lacks viable commercialization. The third strategy for reducing CO2 emissions is carbon cycling based on the conversion of CO2 to its reduced form, which adds value to the waste CO2 captured from industries or collected directly from the air, as depicted in Fig. 2. In the CO2 conversion process, the most oxidised form of carbon, i.e., +4, is reduced to different products such as CO, C2H4, HCOOH, and C2H5O. This is called CO2 reduction or CO2 hydrogenation. For reduction, the electrons and protons are provided by water and it follows the recycling reaction: xCO2 + yH2O → product + zO2(1)

The decarbonisation and carbon sequestration strategies are difficult to full implement due to the gap in industrial metabolism in society. Thus, carbon recycling based on state-of-the-art technology seems to be positive for the environment as it results in the conversion of CO2 into renewable carbon feedstocks for chemical industries.
3. Electrochemical reduction of CO2
CO2 is a centrosymmetric molecule with zero dipole moment, and thus it is chemically inert and thermodynamically stable. Moreover, the electrochemical reduction of CO2 is a multistep process, which requires multiple electrons and protons to obtain the desired products. Generally, three fundamental steps are involved in the reduction of CO2 as follows:
(1) Adsorption of CO2 molecules on the electrode surface.
(2) Charge transfer reactions to cleave C–O bonds and form intermediates.
(3) Rearrangement of products and then their desorption from the surface of the electrocatalyst.47
To accomplish a complete cell reaction, CO2 is reduced at the cathode by utilizing the electrons produced as a result of the counter anodic water oxidation. During charge balancing, a proton gradient is induced in the electrolyte, where at the cathode, protons are consumed for CO2 reduction, as shown in eqn (2), and are produced at the anode during O2 evolution, as shown in eqn (3). Each of the half-cell reactions is driven by the corresponding electrochemical potentials. The high potential electrons reduce CO2 to produce small molecules such as CO, which are further reduced to give different hydrocarbons as follows: Cathode: CO2 + 8H+ + 8e− → CH4 + 2H2O, (E° = 0.17 V)(2) Anode: 4H2O → 8H+ + 2O2 + 8e−, (E° = 1.23 V)(3) Overall: CO2 + 2H2O → CH4 + 2O2, (E° = −1.06 V)(4)
As ECR is a multiple proton-electron transfer (PET) process, it is dependent on the number of PET, applied potential, electrocatalyst and electrolyte used, and various value-added products such as carbon monoxide (CO), formic acid (HCOOH), methane (CH4), ethylene (C2H4), and ethanol (C2H5OH) are produced, as shown in Fig. 4. The 2 proton-electron transfer is quite feasible, whereas >2 proton-electron transfer to give more valuable products48 becomes potentially unfavourable. Therefore, CO is the most prominent product obtained among the products, which is desirable due to its further reduction to formate, methanol, ethanol and hydrocarbons. The cathodic half-cell reaction of CO2 and the associated standard electrode potentials49 are shown in Table 1.

3.1 Electrochemical conditions for ECR
The newcomers in this field need to go through a few experimental conditions to conduct ECR in the laboratory as overlooking slight details may cause the whole experiment to fail. Here, some points related to conducting ECR are mentioned.

3.1.1 Purification of the electrolyte by pre-treatment. 
Pre-electrolysis of the electrolyte is conducted to remove all types of metallic contaminants, considering that these impurities can deactivate the electrodes and harm the electrocatalytic activity. Otherwise, one can get H2 as almost all the products. For this procedure, two Pt gauzes were used as the working and counter electrode in the two-electrode configuration and a cathodic potential of −2 V was applied for 24 h.50 Besides Pt, two graphite rods51 or two Ti foils52 can be used for pre-electrolysis. The electrodes used should be of high purity and should be removed from the solution before electrolysis stops as the chance of dissolution of electrodeposited impurities on the electrode and recontamination can be avoided.


3.1.2 Usage of a specific type of electrochemical cell and its pre-treatment. 
For electrolysis, various electrochemical cell configurations have been reported in the literature. The most common electrochemical cell used is the H-type cell, as shown in Fig. 3a. This cell consists of two compartments separated by a glass frit or usually by a cation or anion exchange membrane. The working and reference electrodes are placed in one compartment and the other contains a counter electrode. The working compartment has an inlet for gas purging and an outlet for the collection of gaseous products. The electrolyte used in it cannot be recycled. This is a clean and easy system to use, but it is not fit for scaling-up due to the low current density and low solubility of CO2 in aqueous electrolyte. The flow cell reactor is an alternative to the electrochemical cell, where the working and counter electrodes are placed parallel to each other and are separated by an ion-exchange membrane (cationic/anionic). The catholyte and anolyte flow in their respective chambers and can be either collected or recycled. There is a separate gas compartment, through which the flow of gas is carried in and out, as shown in Fig. 3b. The electrochemical cell used in the experiment should be first cleaned with strong acid and then boiled in deionized water. For example, sonication of the cell in 20 wt% HNO3 for 1 h,53 or boiling in 1:1 concentrated solution of HNO3 and H2SO4 and before each experiment boiling in ultra-clean water.54

3.1.3 Analysis of electro-reduced product. 
In ECR, both liquid and gaseous products are obtained. For the analysis of gaseous products, gas chromatography (GC) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and field-emission detector (FID) are used universally. An FID with a methanizer is used to detect CO and hydrocarbons such as CH4, C2H4, and C2H6, while a TCD is used to quantify H2. A carrier gas is used to move the gas through the column. The most commonly used carrier gases are H2, He, Ar, and N2. Initially, the GC is calibrated using calibration gas. For all experiments, CO2 is purged 30 min before electrolysis and the experiment is allowed to proceed for 2 h with gas analysis done after every 30 min. The liquid products such as HCOO−, CH3OH, CH3COO−, and C2H4 are analysed via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Subsequently, the faradaic efficiency (FE) of the products is determined.

3.2 Important fundamental parameters
There are some useful parameters or system metrics such as overpotential, current density, faradaic efficiency, energy efficiency, and Tafel slope that need to be understood for the efficient operation of the ECR system.

3.2.1 Overpotential (η). 
As its name suggests, the overpotential (η) is the excess potential required than the thermodynamically expected potential for carrying out a reaction. It is the difference between the onset potential (Eapplied, applied potential at which the reaction starts) and the standard reduction potential (E°) of the redox reaction, which is given as: η = Eapplied − E°(5)


3.2.2 Faradaic efficiency (FE). 
This is the most important parameter in ECR. It is defined as the percentage of electrons consumed for the formation of the product. Numerically, it is the ratio of charge used in the formation of the product (Qn) and the total current (Qtotal) passed through the electrochemical cell. (6)where α is the number of electrons transferred in ECR, n is the number of moles of the desired product, F is the Faraday constant (96485 C mol−1). FE relies firmly on the catalyst, and thus to achieve a high FE, the appropriate electrocatalyst must be used.55


3.2.3 Current density (j). 
Current density (j) refers to the ratio of the magnitude of the current supplied to the geometric surface area of the working electrode. Partial current density (jn) is a term used for specific products obtained by multiplying the corresponding FE by the overall current density. jn = j × FE(7)


3.2.4 Energy efficiency (EE). 
EE is the overall output energy, i.e., energy in the products divided by the input energy, which is supplied in the form of electrical energy. The equation is as follows: (8)where Eeq is the equilibrium potential. This equation suggests that a high EE for ECR is obtained by the combination of a low overpotential and high FE.

3.2.5 Tafel slope
The Tafel plot correlates the overpotential with the logarithm of current density, as shown in the following equation: (9)
The intercept of the plot gives the exchange current density (i0), which is the current density at equilibrium. The exchange current density presents the catalytic activity and reaction kinetics.56 The Tafel slope shows the charge transfer coefficient (α) and is a very useful tool to investigate the reaction mechanism by governing the rate-determining step (RDS).57 The smaller the Tafel slope, the larger the charge transfer and the more active the catalyst. A change in the slope implies a change in the reaction mechanism, which may be due to a change in the reaction conditions such as the reactants, catalyst, and concentration of electrolyte.58 This can be understood from an example of the formation of methane on polycrystalline Cu foil and Cu nanoparticles supported on a glassy carbon electrode. The Tafel slope changed from 86 mV dec−1 on Cu foil to 60 mV dec−1 on Cu NPs supported on a glassy carbon electrode, as shown in Fig. 5a. This occurred due to the fast one-electron transfer process before the rate-limiting non-electrochemical step, as presented in Fig. 5b.59

3.3 Advantages of ECR
Some exceptional advantages that demonstrate the superiority of the electrochemical reduction of CO2 over the other reduction routes are as follows:
(a) ECR occurs at ambient pressure and temperature unlike other catalysis processes, which require harsh conditions (high temperature and pressure) for the initiation of the reaction.
(b) It may involve the use of grid electricity from renewable sources such as wind, solar, and hydropower plants and no extra CO2 is generated during this reduction process, and therefore it is environmentally friendly.
(c) By tuning the external parameters such as applied potential, electrocatalyst, and electrolyte, different products can be obtained.60
(d) ECR is a much easier technique than other chemical reduction processes in terms of ease, time and product efficiency.
(e) The best part of ECR is the production of value-added products such as chemical feedstocks and fuels at the expense of the greenhouse gas CO2 and water.
3.4 Challenges in ECR
Despite its several advantages, some key challenges have limited CO2 reduction to an academic endeavour. Therefore, these challenges need to be overcome for the commercialization of ECR. The following points concisely describe the limitations or challenges that occur during the electrochemical reduction process.
(a) The first challenge of ECR in aqueous medium is the low solubility of CO2 in water.61 The mass transport of CO2 to the cathode surface is one of the major limiting factors, which becomes the main obstacle for the mass-scale formation of products. Also, product bubble formation on the electrode surface hinders the reaction. This limitation can be overcome by the use of gas diffusion electrodes (GDE).62
(b) CO2 is a highly stable molecule63 with a bond strength of ∼532 kJ mol−1. Therefore, a large energy barrier has to be crossed to activate it. In ECR, the first intermediate is CO2˙−, needing a standard potential of −1.9 V vs. SHE,64 which is mainly responsible for the high overpotential. This overpotential can be reduced by stabilizing the intermediate, which is the principal function of the catalyst.
(c) In aqueous electrolyte together with ECR, a competitive water reduction or hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) occurs, which decreases the product efficiency.65 Thus, a catalyst with a high overpotential for the HER will typically give a favourable FE for ECR.
(d) For a catalyst to be commercialized, the essential condition is stability, but during the reduction process, the active sites of electrocatalysts become deactivated or blocked by the reaction intermediates, impurities or by-products.66
(e) A mixture of liquid and gaseous products are formed in ECR, which are difficult and quite expensive to separate.67
Overall, an electrocatalyst should have a low overpotential, high current density, suppress the competitive HER to increase the selectivity of the desired products and long-term stability for improved ECR.
4. Electrocatalyst: a brief overview
In an electrochemical reaction, the catalyst assists in electron transfer between the electrode and reactants or facilitates the intermediate chemical transformation described by the overall half-reaction. It may be present on the electrode surface or may be the electrode surface itself. The activity of an electrocatalyst depends on the number of active sites present on its surface. The greater the number of active sites on the catalyst surface, the better its catalytic activity. In ECR, the generation of the key intermediate, that is, CO2˙−, is regarded as the rate-determining step in most cases, and an efficient electrocatalyst is expected to stabilize this intermediate to attain high faradaic efficiency. Based on the binding tendency of intermediates and release of the final products, metal electrodes are divided into four groups, as depicted by the different colours in Fig. 6a.68
 Fig. 6  (a) Different metals with the FE of their major product represented by different colors. (b) Binding energies of the intermediates (CO* and H*) of different metals. Reproduced with permission.68 Copyright 2017 Wiley-VCH. 
Group 1 involves Hg,69 Tl,70 In,71 Sn,24–26 and Bi.72 These metals bind loosely to CO2˙−, and therefore formate or formic acid is formed as the dominant product.73
Group 2 involves Au,17–19 Ag,20,21 Zn,27,28 and Pd29,30 metals, which bind to the intermediate *COOH too tightly to induce its instantaneous reduction to the *CO intermediate. A weak association between *CO and the metal surface allows facile desorption, yielding CO as the major reaction product.
Group 3 includes Ni,74 Fe,74 Pt,22,23 and Ti75 metals, which are more selective towards hydrogen evolution than CO2 reduction.
Group 4 includes only Cu metal, which is capable of reducing CO2 to several products such as alcohols and hydrocarbons, depending on the *COH or *CHO intermediates formed. Its mechanism involves the addition of more than 2 electrons. Hori and co-workers performed ECR in 0.5 M KHCO3 at 5 mA cm−2 for one hour on different polycrystalline metal electrodes. The results are presented in Table 2.76 This table shows that for each metal electrode to attain a specific current density (here −5 mA cm−2) a prominent overpotential is required. The lowest overpotential (0.6 V) is needed for Au to obtain CO (87%), whereas the largest is required for Pb (1.1 V) to obtain formate (97%).

4.1 Uniqueness of copper
The attractiveness of Cu is that it is not product specific, and thus it can be utilized over a wide range of applications by tuning its physical and electrochemical properties. The division of metals into four groups is based on the binding energy of the intermediates to the metal surface in ECR and HER. The uniqueness of Cu to produce several hydrogenated products lies in the fact that it is the only metal that shows a negative adsorption energy value for CO* but positive adsorption energy value for H*, as shown in Fig. 6b.68 Cu forms a separate group, showing binding energies of ΔECO* and ΔEH* intermediate and product formation beyond CO as Cu binds CO* and does not have underpotential deposited hydrogen (Hupd) for the production of H2. In 1985, Hori et al. presented a study, which for the first time quantified both liquid and gaseous products with 100% FE and also showed the exceptional behaviour of Cu to produce different products including CO, H2, CH4, HCOO−, and C2H4.57 Kuhl and his group, years later, confirmed this result with an overlaying current density. They also showed the generation of a total of 16 products, which are divided into three groups, including major, intermediate and minor products, as shown in Fig. 7.77 It is perceivable that the FE of different products lies within the potential range of −1.2 to −0.4 V vs. RHE, although the peak intensities seem to vary with a varying potential. Thus, the desired products can be obtained with significant efficiency upon applying specific potentials. Therefore, there is a need to tune the activity and selectivity of Cu metal to improve its catalytic efficiency, where the activity of Cu varies depends on its morphology, structure and alloying, and its selectivity depends on the electrolyte, pH, temperature and other experimental conditions.78,79

Initially, Cu foil was used directly as a catalyst,80,81 but its low selectivity towards products made it necessary to deeply understand the distinctive behaviour of copper towards ECR. Therefore, several possible nanostructures of copper including nanoparticles (NPs), nanowires (NWs), overlayers, nanoflowers, nanospheres, and foams, as shown in Fig. 8, are being thoroughly investigated to improve its activity, selectivity and energy efficiency for ECR, which consequently will help in the growth of sustainable energy sources. Hori's studies presented that surface roughening introduces surface defects, such as steps and vacancies, which favour the reaction of adsorbed H-atoms.82,83 The effect of particle size and porosity was studied using nano-porous and nano-particulate electrode surfaces of Cu and other metals.84–86 Tang et al. investigated electrode surfaces with three different morphologies (electro-polished, sputter-coated, and nanoparticle coated), and the results showed that the latter two had greater selectivity for hydrocarbons (HCs) due to an increase in the area of rough surface, which has more un-coordinated sites such as edges, steps and defects that stabilize the intermediates.86 DFT calculations further supported that these sites participate actively in CO2 reduction.85,87,88 Therefore, it can be concluded that nanostructures with more deformations within the electrode will have greater reactivity for the electrochemical reduction process. Cuf is a unique three-dimensional (3D) nanostructured material, which is the combination of various pores (ranging from nanometer to millimeter) and structural defects, large electrochemically active surface area, abundance of low-coordinated sites, high surface roughness, undoubtedly making it the right choice for ECR by researchers, as presented in Fig. 8. The summarized progress in the field of Cuf and its derivatives in ECR is shown in Table 3.

5.1 Cuf as an electrocatalyst
The structure of the electrodeposited Cu has a high impact on ECR. Accordingly, Goncalves found that specific selectivities can be obtained by using Cu electrodes with different morphologies including dendritic, honeycomb and 3D-foam structures. The selectivity for C2 hydrocarbons (C2H4 and C2H6) increased for the 3D-foam and honeycomb structures and CH4 production was suppressed at −1.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 0.1 M KHCO3.89 In 2014, Palmore et al. demonstrated the use of 3D-Cuf prepared via hydrogen bubbles as a soft template method for CO2 electro-reduction.90 The synthesized Cuf possessed highly porous walls with a pore size ranging between 20–50 μm and nanoscale dendritic structures projected out through these walls, as shown in Fig. 9a–f. The FE of HCOOH increased to 26% at −1.1 V, which was significantly higher than that obtained over smooth Cu (<1% at −1.1 V) and it reached the maximum of 37% at −1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl, as shown in Fig. 9g. The increase in the thickness of Cuf increase the FE of HCOOH to 29% as compared to that of 3% on the smooth Cu surface. Interestingly, this report claimed to synthesize propylene for the first time on Cuf-based electrodes. The hierarchical porosity, surface roughness and capture of reaction species in the pores were responsible for the admirable results of ECR. The same group presented the use of clathrate hydrates as an electrolyte additive in ECR with Cuf as the electrocatalyst. The FE for CO and its further reduced carbonaceous products increased to 80% from 20% with non-clathrate electrolytes. Clathrate hydrates caused the enrichment of a larger volume of gas than usually dissolved in liquid.91 Recently, R. F. Zarandi et al. developed a homogeneous co-catalyst, i.e., Cuf accompanied by 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium bromide (BMIMB), an ionic liquid (IL) in the electrolyte, for the conversion of CO2 to ethanol and obtained more than 46% improvement in FE compared to the previously reported experiment.92 The aromatic imidazolium ring forms a strong bond to CO2 as 6πe− get distributed over five ring atoms. Therefore, the CO2˙− intermediate was stabilized by the double bond oscillation and resonance structures of the imidazolium cations. Then, CO was formed by the elimination of water followed by the vicinal connection of two CO molecules, which underwent addition/elimination reactions to give ethanol. The synergistic electrocatalytic effect between Cuf and the utilized IL accounted for the firm interaction of CO2 and produced C2 compounds. Gu et al. performed a study to determine the effect of the electrodeposition parameters on the morphology of Cuf. The optimized deposition conditions were 30 s with a current density of 3 A cm−2. The pore size of Cuf was controlled using CTAB additive. The CO production rate was found to be 11.91 μmol h−1 cm−2 using Cuf with CTAB and maintained a value of more than 8.95 μmol h−1 cm−2 during 1 h electrolysis, which was 8 times more than that of smooth Cu.93

5.2 Oxide-derived Cuf
Surface morphology has an important impact on both activity and product selectivity in CO2 reduction. Thus, to improve the low-coordinated surface sites on Cu, various methods have been used including electrodeposition,94 reduction of oxide phases, electropolishing,86 and anodization.94 Among them, the reduction of surface oxide phases is considered the most beneficial.95 Thermally formed copper oxide was the first reported oxide-based electrocatalyst that significantly increased the yield of methanol in ECR.96 Kanan et al. presented in their work that nanostructured metal electrodes were highly efficient for CO2 reduction.18 Subsequently, they prepared nanocrystalline oxide-derived (OD) Cu and achieved an FE of ∼40% for CO with a total current density of 2.7 mA cm−2 at −0.5 V vs. RHE. Moreover, multi-oxygenates such as ethanol, acetate and n-propanol were obtained with an FE of up to 57% using OD–Cu at a modest potential in the range of −0.25 V to −0.5 V vs. RHE in alkaline solution.97 Therefore, Cu-oxides (Cu2O and CuO) were synthesised over the 3D-skeleton of Cuf by Huang et al. to utilize the properties of both Cuf and Cu-oxides, which were then annealed in air and further reduced electrochemically to obtain a surface-restructured Cuf electrode.34 Compared to the annealed Cu foil, an extremely high current density of ∼9 mA cm−2 at −0.45 V vs. RHE with CO (39%) and HCOOH (23%) was obtained. This can be attributed to the synergistic effect between the enhanced surface and the preferable formation of low index (100) and (111) Cu facets during the reconstruction process, which caused an increase in the number of grain boundaries, and eventually enhanced the number of metastable active sites. Copper shows a tendency for formate production only at low overpotential and moderate rate.90 Dutta et al. synthesized OD–Cuf via a template-assisted Cu electrodeposition method,98 as shown in Fig. 10a, which underwent operando reduction.99 These mesoporous Cu electrodes gained the highest C2 efficiencies (55%) at −0.8 V, as shown in Fig. 10b and c. The enhanced selectivity of Cuf for C2 was due to two effects. Firstly, the availability of specific surface sites for C–C coupling (dominant (100)), which became active by in situ reduction of Cu2O, and secondly, the mesoporous material, which temporally trapped gaseous intermediates. The total FE of the C2 products depended highly on the pore size or thickness of the catalyst, as shown in Fig. 10d, which reached the maximum value with a pore size in the range of 50–100 μm. Below 50 μm, the FE of C2 dropped significantly,90 and above a pore size of 150 μm, the FE of C2 decreased to near 20%. The atomic-scale mechanism of enhanced C2 production can be obtained in the future by operando spectroscopic studies.

5.3 CuxO foam
Copper oxides (CuxO) have shown enhanced reactivity and selectivity for C2 and C3 products such as ethylene, ethanol, and n-propanol. In a recent study, Dutta et al. used operando XAS, XRD and Raman spectroscopy to determine the potential-dependent changes in the chemical states of Cu species in Cu oxide foams and their specific role in ECR.100 Using a dynamic H-bubble template, Cuf was electrodeposited on activated carbon, and then thermally annealed in air at 300 °C for 12 h to form intermixed CuO/Cu2O phases. The basic principle of the operando techniques used is presented in Fig. 11a. All three operando techniques proved that the oxides were completely reduced to metallic Cu before the production of hydrocarbons and alcohols. The XAS technique is sensitive to the bulk of the catalyst. The potential-dependent redox state changes in the Cu species are presented by the potential-dependent Cu K-edge XANES spectra of the CuxO foam in Fig. 11b. It can be seen from Fig. 11c that in CuxO having different contents of Cu(0), Cu(I), and Cu(II) as a function of the applied potential, i.e., +0.6 V vs. RHE, CuxO predominantly consists of Cu(II) species. A potential-dependent transition from Cu(II) to Cu(I) occurred prior to the reduction of the oxidic precursor to metallic Cu(0), which started from 0 V vs. RHE and was completed at about −0.7 V vs. RHE. Operando XRD gives the changes in the crystal structure that occurs due to a change in oxidation state. Fig. 11d and e present crystalline Cu2O as an intermediate phase whose amount increased in the bulk during the reduction of CuxO. The operando Raman study (Fig. 11f) mainly focused on the surface of the Cu/CuxO foam. The concerted chemisorption phenomenon of carbonate/bicarbonate and CO2-related species presented by the green spot in Fig. 11g occurred at a potential of +0.1 V vs. RHE preferentially on the metallic Cu domains called the fingerprint for metallic Cu. The surface-confined processes remained almost invisible in the operando XAS and XRD. Thus, the operando techniques used clearly presented the difference in the potential-dependent surface behaviour and corresponding structural and compositional transitions in the 3D foam.

5.4 Effect of different substrates on Cuf
The substrate highly influences the type of nanostructure obtained by electrodeposition. The morphology is completely different when the substrate is changed from metallic to non-metallic. Dutta et al. did a comparison study between electro-polished, annealed and electrodeposited Cu catalysts, as shown in Fig. 12a–d with special emphasis on C2 product formation.101 Catalytically active skin was formed on the surface of the Cu skeleton or sponge, i.e., it was used as a substrate, and the SEM images are shown in Fig. 12e–g. Among them, the latter two favoured the C2 pathway (C2H4 and C2H6) but differed in the ratio of the product (C2H6/C2H4), which was higher in the case of electrodeposited Cuf (Fig. 12h). This may be due to the μm-sized pores in Cuf, which favoured a longer mean residence time of intermediates and led to completely reduced C2 products, but C2 FE presented here was less than that obtained over Cuf on planar wafers. This may be due to the less uniform current distribution during foam deposition on the 3D sponge compared to the planar wafer surfaces. The design of this type of porous electrode with a controlled flow of CO2 reactants through the catalyst offers the possibility of C2 product formation.

(h) FEs for electropolished (black), electrodeposited (green), and annealed (blue) Cu skeleton samples (reprinted with permission.101 Copyright (2017), the American Chemical Society). 
To check the efficiency of Cuf, Marepally et al. demonstrated the deposition of Cuf on various substrates (Cu, Ti, Al, Fe, and Fe–Cr–Ni) and also on a carbon-based gas diffusion layer (GDL), as shown in Fig. 13a.102 The nano-morphology highly depends on the electro-deposition time and the nature of the substrate, as shown in the SEM images (Fig. 13c–f). Cuf deposited on Cu foil for varying times was represented as CFx, where x is the deposition time in min. Cu–CF2 presented the highest current density, metallic area and led to the maximum yield of formic acid compared to Cu–CF1 and Cu–CF4. The fractal dimension, which is the dendritic structure of Cu–CF2, made it different from the others due to the presence of active sites such as smoother edges and denser surfaces for CO and CH4. The impact of the substrate on the activity and selectivity of Cuf can be seen in Fig. 13b. On employing an aluminium grid as the substrate for Cuf (Cu–AG2), the production of acetic acid was improved and that of CO and CH4 was reduced. In contrast, using an alloy (Fe–Cr–Ni) as the substrate for Cuf resulted in maximum C-productivity with HCOOH and CO as the major products. Cu electrodeposited on GDL produced formic acid (60%) with a total C-FE of ∼80%. This study gave evidence that together with the specific chemical nature of the electrocatalyst, the nano-morphology and fractal dimension of the electrocatalyst play an important role in the activity and selectivity of the product, and the type of nanostructure obtained during electrodeposition is significantly influenced by the substrate.

Eight Cu foams with substantially different morphologies and pore dimensions were obtained by Klingan et al. depending on the choice of the metal substrate (Pt or Cu) used during Cu electrodeposition and also on the other factors such as the deposition current and deposition time.103 The reactivity of these Cufs with a variety of morphologies was comprehensively investigated by analysis of the product spectrum and in situ electrochemical spectroscopy (X-ray absorption near-edge structure, extended X-ray absorption fine structure, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy). This study presented the dependence of the geometric partial current densities of Cu catalysts on the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), as shown in Fig. 14a–d, where a large surface area favoured the formation of CO and C2H4 at a low overpotential. Although the current density of CO (jCO) was directly proportional to the ECSA, a greater increase was obtained for the current density of ethylene (jC2H4). They proposed that the two adsorbed CO* precursors present in the foam preferred to combine to give C2H4. These chemisorbed CO* blocked the surface-active sites and may suppress H2 production, but this was not a decisive determinant for it. Another reason for the suppression of H2 and CH4 may be the low proton supply due to pronounced alkalization on the Cu catalyst, as shown by the HCO3−/CO32− equilibrium through operando Raman spectroscopy in Fig. 14e–h. This equilibrium shifted towards CO32− with an increase in pH and resulted in a decrease in the Raman bands for HCO3− (1015 and 1363 cm−1), whereas an increase in the bands for CO32− (1065 cm−1), which favoured the formation of CO and C2H4 as they followed a pH-independent mechanism. In this work, for the first time, local pH values at the Cu cathode were experimentally investigated during ECR through operando Raman spectroscopy, which can be beneficial to determine the mechanistic pathways of ECR in the future.

6. Modified Cuf in CO2 reduction
Cu as a single metal has been used for decades for the ECR. As described earlier, Cu, the coinage metal, presents versatile behaviour towards CO2 reduction. Cuf-based electrodes have been extensively studied by researchers in terms of shape, size, structure and composition. For further improvements in the activity and selectivity of Cu, the tuning of Cu electrocatalysts using secondary metals (Sn, Au, Zn, Bi, Ag, etc.) was studied to explore their efficiency and to lower the energy difference between CO2 and its intermediates, which can reduce the overpotential of the ECR. Several bimetallic electrocatalysts such as Au–Cu,104–106 Cu–Sn,107 Cu–Zn,108 Cu–Pd on GDL,109 and Cu–Ag110 have been studied (Table 3), which have shown significant results as they can influence the d-band centre of the active components, which will stabilise the intermediates and lead to reduced products. Similarly, Cuf was also modified with other metals (Sn, Bi, Ag, Pd, etc.) or polymers (acrylamide, acrylic acid and allylamine) to upgrade its catalytic performance in terms of product formation, selectivity and faradic efficiency.
6.1 Cuf modified by Sn
Tin has attained much attraction for the fabrication of Cuf-based electrocatalysts as it is a non-noble metal, and thus low cost, non-toxic and shows high hydrogen evolution overpotential.111 It is a well-known catalyst due to its high activity and stability towards C1 production. Wang et al. performed for the first time the electroplating of Sn on a Cuf substrate, which was denoted as Sn/f-Cu.112 It exhibited better catalytic activity compared to both the Cuf electrode and Sn plate electrode. Formate with an FE of ∼83.5% was obtained at −1.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Chen et al. also showed a high FE of ∼90.4% with a current density of ∼57.7 mA cm−2 for formate using a 3D-framework with spiky Cu@Sn nanocones over a macroporous Cuf substrate, as shown in Fig. 15a–c.113 The selectivity for formate increased due to the high curvature nanotip of the cones, which generated a strong electric field to concentrate local K+, suggesting the enhanced formation of the CO2˙− intermediate due to more electron transfer to CO2, which led to the formation of formate, as shown in Fig. 15d and e. The large ECSA facilitated the efficient mass transfer of reactants on the Cu@Sn nanocones over the Cuf electrode. High electrochemical activity for formate was attained using heterostructured intermetallic CuSn electrocatalysts (Cu3Sn/Cu3Sn5) developed on porous Cuf via an electrodeposition-calcination process,114 as shown in Fig. 16a and b. The CuSn intermetallic electrocatalyst presented an FE of 82% for formate with a current density of 18.9 mA cm−2 at −0.1 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M NaHCO3 for 42 h. The current density showed an exceptional increase and reached 148 mA cm−2 for formate production with 87% using a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) in 1 M KOH electrolyte. The preference for the formation of HCOOH over CO can be understood based on Fig. 16c, which shows that the absorption energy of HCOO* was more negative than COOH*, and thus favoured the formation of formate. Also, the moderate binding of H* on the CuSn intermetallic electrocatalyst was responsible for the low H2 production, as shown in Fig. 16d.

Recently, unprecedented selectivity for the production of formate (100%) at −0.93 V vs. RHE was attained using a 3D-core shell porous Cu@Sn hybrid electrode, which was stable for up to 15 h.115 The electrode activity was controlled by tuning the shell structure of Sn (granules) on the core surface of Cu (dendrites) through a two-step electrodeposition process, as shown in Fig. 17a and the TEM-EDS images (Fig. 17b). The star structure (Cu) similar to the dendritic granular structure of Cuf provided a greater surface area compared to the cross and square; consequently, the high mass activity accounted for the high FE, as presented in Fig. 17 c and d. The ameliorated core–shell model of SnCu presented phenomenal results. Wang et al. demonstrated the preparation of an electrocatalyst via a one-step electrodeposition process using the hydrogen bubble-assisted template-based method.116 The Sn2.7Cu catalyst with a hierarchical SnCu core and SnOx shell (Fig. 18a) achieved the current density of 406.7 ± 14.4 mA cm−2 with a C1 FE of 98.0 ± 0.9% at −0.7 V vs. RHE and attained stability at 243.1 ± 19.2 mA cm−2 with a C1 FE of 99.0 ± 0.5% at −0.55 V vs. RHE for 40 h. The in situ EXAFS and HRTEM showed that in situ reconstruction of the SnOx shell occurred. The reconstructed Sn/SnOx interface was responsible for boosting the ECR, thereby inhibiting the HER by weakening the binding of the H* intermediate and also by lowering the potential required for the generation of HCOOH, as demonstrated by the Gibbs free energy diagrams (Fig. 18b–h). J. Zheng et al. synthesised an Sn-modified porous Cuf catalyst via a low-cost scalable electrodeposition process for the conversion of CO2 to CO and obtained 92–94% FE for CO over a wide potential range (−0.75 V to −0.9 V) vs. RHE. The 3D porous dendrite architecture possessing a core–shell model of each dendrite, in which Cu acts as the core and Cu oxide/Sn oxide as the shell, rendered abundant electrochemical active sites for the production of CO and also facilitated mass transport.117 By tuning the amount of Sn and Cu, the surface composition can be modified, which helps to understand the metal effect towards ECR. Liu et al. fabricated a Cuf electrode with partially reduced oxides of Sn and Cu (SnOx and CuOx) employing different deposition times.118 Then, the Cu/SnO2 (control sample) and annealed Cu/SnO2 (A-Cu/SnO2) electrodes were characterized, which distinct compositions. Due to annealing, the significant migration of Cu and Sn atoms occurred, leading to an increase in Cu atoms, and eventually a decrease in Sn atoms on the surface because slight breakage of the SnO2 film occurred after annealing, which resulted in the formation of CuOx on the surface and SnO2 moved in towards the holes. The dramatic increase in current density in the case of A-Cu/SnO2 favoured CO2 reduction activity, which followed the order of A-Cu/SnO2 > Cu/SnO2 > Cuf. The annealed species with different deposition times of SnO2 on Cuf caused the dominant production of CO (FE ∼70–75%) and least HCOOH (FE < 5%), which presented characteristic Sn–Cu synergistic catalysis. Conversely, in the case of Cu/SnO2 with an increase in deposition time of SnO2 on Cuf, the selectivity shifted from CO to HCOOH. This was due to the increase in the amount of SnO2 on the surface, which favours the formation of HCOOH. Thus, the relative amount of metals change the selectivity or product distribution for Cu electrocatalyst.

Thus, these studies provide a potent strategy for regulating Sn-Cuf-based electrocatalysts for highly selective ECR and the practical applications of this technology.
6.2 Cuf modified by Bi
Experimenting with CuSn electrocatalysts, Guan et al. synthesized Bi-doped SnO nanosheets grown over Cuf via a one-step hydrothermal reaction process.119 Bi–SnO/Cuf presented the highest selectivity for HCOOH and obtained 93% FE at −1.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which exhibited long-term stability for 30 h. Bi doping in SnO nanosheets stabilized Sn2+ and prevented its reduction during CO2 reduction and inhibited the formation of CO and H2, as can be seen from energy barriers in Fig. 19a–d. DFT calculations showed that electron transfer from the catalyst to the Cuf substrate and Bi doping enhanced the adsorption of the HCOO− intermediates.

Bi, as an HER inert metal, promotes CO2 conversion to formate. This motivated Zhang et al. to prepare an electrocatalyst by growing twisted Bi-NWs with a number of lattice dislocations on Cuf (Cuf @ Bi-NWs).120 Firstly, a uniform Bi layer was deposited on Cuf via the galvanic replacement method, followed by calcination at 200 °C in the air to form a Bi2O3 layer. Then, this layer was transformed into Bi-NWs through in situ electrochemical reduction. This catalyst achieved 95% FE for formate at −0.69 V with a current density of ∼15 mA cm−2. The high density of lattice dislocations with a greater number of uncoordinated sites, which provided low energy barriers for the intermediates, were responsible for the high FE. The use of crystal defect engineering can improve the efficiency of ECR on Bi metal.
6.3 Cuf modified by Ag
Selectivity for CO at a low overpotential was found to be presented by noble and expensive metals such as Au and Ag due to their weak ability to bind CO* intermediates.121,122 Kottakkat et al. presented that the alloy of Cuf and Ag prepared by via electrodeposition, as shown in Fig. 20a, was highly selective for CO production.123 The incorporation of Ag into Cu dendritic structures altered the binding strength of the intermediates. Also, the lower H* surface coverage due to the presence of Ag on Cuf suppressed the HER. According to the Raman CO adsorption band area, as shown in Fig. 20b, it was clear that the maximum CO adsorption was attained at a much higher potential on Ag–Cuf than on Cuf only. Consequently, at a low overpotential, improved selectivity for CO was obtained for Ag–Cuf compared to Cuf catalysts, as can be seen in Fig. 20c, which provided strong evidence of the existence of a strong synergistic interaction between the metal components in the AgCu catalyst during ECR. Theoretical studies have shown that the (110) and (220) Ag planes increased the production of CO.124 The complete coverage of Cuf with Ag prevents Cu from taking part in the catalysis, while providing crystallographic surface orientations that are selective for the production of CO.

Ahn et al. prepared Ag/Cu and Au/Cu foams on a Ti substrate via bubble template Cu electrodeposition followed by galvanic displacement of the noble metal for the conversion of CO2 to CO.125 The roughened surface of the foam presented a morphological advantage and showed a high current density for CO. Between them, the Ag/Cu foam presented a better performance in CO production due to its porous structure and low Ag loading mass, which account for its low-cost effectiveness. Urbain et al. tailored 3D-Cuf with Ag via electrodeposition for CO2 conversion to CO.126 The combination of Ag catalyst with Cuf enhanced the FE to 95.7% at −0.8 V vs. RHE. This enhancement was mainly due to two reasons. (1) The mass transport limitation was reduced due to an increase in the amplified ECSA. (2) High selectivity of Ag for CO production. Besides CO, bimetallic AgCu foam could also be made selective towards alcohol (ethanol and propanol) formation by activating the foam through annealing. Thus, the prepared catalysts shown in the HR-TEM images (Fig. 21a and b) presented high selectivity for ethanol with an FEEtOH of ∼33.7% and propanol with an FEPrOH of ∼6.9% at −1.0 V and −0.9 V vs. RHE with 100 h durability (Fig. 21c and d), respectively.127 The OD–Ag15Cu85 foam exhibited a high degree of dispersion of nm-sized Ag domains (CO producer) embedded in the Cu matrix (C–C coupler, alcohol former), which transport the CO intermediates to the Cu sites for ethanol formation (Fig. 21e). The synergistic effect of a high CO abundance at a high overpotential and the selective activation of Cu by oxide formation led to excellent activity and selectivity towards CO2 reduction. Both XRD and Raman spectroscopy operando studies presented that oxide reduction was completed before ECR began. Compared to pristine noble metals (Ag), the incorporation of these noble metals in 3D Cuf provides a more strategic way of forming platforms for the design of highly active and selective cathode materials for CO2-to-CO conversion.

6.4 Cuf modified by PdCu alloy
The recent study done by Dutta et al. presented high selectivity for n-propanol by a binary PdCu alloy foam prepared via the dynamic H-bubble template method, as shown in Fig. 22a.128 The mechanism of two-fold selectivity of C3 alcohol is presented in Fig. 22b, showing the transportation of chemisorbed CO* and atomic H* from Pd-rich domains to the activated Cu-rich domains by surface diffusion when C–C coupling and subsequent hydrogenation process occur to form oxygenated products.128 An excellent long-term stability of 102 h was obtained for n-propanol with an FE of ∼13.7% at a current density of −1.15 mA cm−2 using the catalyst composition oxide-derived Pd9Cu91 alloy foam (Fig. 22c–f). The extraordinary performance of Pd-based Cuf was due to the complete suppression of the C1 hydrocarbon pathway, and thus future work should focus on this type of electrocatalyst to improve the selectivity of C3 products.

6.5 Cuf modified by In
A mesoporous dendritic Cu96In4 foam was prepared by Reisner et al. and found to be electrocatalytically active for CO production from aqueous CO2 at low overpotentials.129 The weak adsorption of *CO intermediate on the bimetallic alloy surface makes it highly selective for CO without any multi-carbon product formation, which was shown by operando Raman spectroscopy. The bimetallic alloy having a unique dendritic foam morphology yielded 70% FE even at −0.3 V vs. RHE, which is better than that previously reported for CuIn materials.130,131 Subsequently, the excellent performance of the Cu96In4 catalyst was employed in an overall bias-free tandem device (perovskite‖BiVO4 device) for CO2 conversion using water as the electron donor. This work highlights the potential of alloying to improve the catalytic performance of ECR and strategies to integrate these catalysts into solar-driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices.
6.6 Ag/In/Cu foam
Ahn et al. prepared a nanostructured Ag/In/Cu foam via a facile electrochemical method.132 This catalyst exhibited an excellent performance compared to previous catalysts in terms of CO FE and partial current density in a low overpotential region. The electrodeposited In is partially displaced by Ag with different compositions of Ag and In, which is easily controlled by adjusting the displacement time of Ag. The bubble-templated Cuf acts as a roughened metal support for the Ag/In catalyst and provides a large ECSA, and the suppression of parasitic HER by In and the selectivity of Ag for CO result in a notable performance in ECR.
6.7 Polymer-modified Cuf
Tuning the selectivity towards hydrocarbons, Andreoli et al. experimented with modified Cuf using polymers such as acrylamide, acrylic acid and allylamine for ECR to industrial feedstocks such as C2H4 and CH4.133 The FE for C2H4 increased from 13% (unmodified Cu) to 26% at −0.96 V vs. RHE (Fig. 23a). The DFT study showed that C2H4 formation was enhanced due to: (1) Cu surface activation for CO dimerization, as shown in the scheme (Fig. 23b), (2) by H-bonding of the –NH2 group with CO dimer, and (3) local surface coverage was increased by facilitating the adsorption of CO molecules near the polymer. All this occurred in the case of poly(acrylic acid) also, but it was unstable, whereas poly(allylamine) suppressed CO2 reduction by favouring HER. As shown in Fig. 23c, in the presence of acrylamide oligomer, the CO dimerization over the Cu (100) surface was favoured due to a decrease in the dimerization activation barrier by 0.06 eV and also the dimer formed was stabilized by almost 0.2 eV.

6.8 Urea-modified Cuf
For the production of one of the most important industrial solvents, i.e., propanol, Barron et al. performed a pre- and post-catalysis study of ECR using Cuf as an electrocatalyst.134 Pristine and urea-modified Cuf were tested, where the addition of urea to Cu increased the FE of n-propanol from 3% to 5% at −0.83 V vs. RHE and adversely quenched the production of i-propanol. The catalyst consisted of cuboctahedra and dendrites before electrolysis, which underwent structural rearrangement after electrolysis for 35 min. The transformations in crystallinity, surface composition and morphology were characterized ex situ using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which led to the deactivation of Cuf. Therefore, there is a clear need for more research on the selectivity and stability of electrocatalysts.
7. Summary and outlook
The rampant increase in CO2, a greenhouse gas, has led to undesirable climatic changes. Thus, reducing it electrochemically to value-added products and feedstocks has been considered a feasible alternative for diminishing the CO2 levels in the environment, in addition to making use of electrical energy from renewable sources (solar, wind, hydro power, etc.). Significant research is being done theoretically and experimentally to fill the gap between fundamental laboratory practices and industrial needs. In parallel with the detailed discussions in this review, the comparison data in Table 3 can also provide summarized information to newcomers and experienced researchers in the field of ECR with a focus on the literature of Cuf and its derivatives for ECR.
In this review, Cuf and modified Cuf-based electrocatalysts were discussed for efficient CO2 reduction. Many factors such as pore size, composition, surface roughness, and defect density affect the catalytic activity of electrocatalysts. The selectivity for a particular product can be improved by alloying or using the core/shell model. Here, we mention some challenges and their possible solutions for carrying efficient ECR.
• The paucity in a detailed understanding and accurate knowledge of the reaction pathways on the catalyst surface presents a great challenge in ECR. To date, mainly ex situ characterisations have been done before and after the reaction. This problem can be addressed by using in situ or operando characterisations, which will provide insight about the adsorbed intermediates, active sites and oxidation states of metal and help to understand the reaction pathways more easily.
• ECR is a redox reaction, but most research is limited to only cathodic half-reactions. Thus, to take the reduction of CO2 to the commercial level, the anodic reactions need to be investigated.
• Besides activity and selectivity, stability is an important factor determining the feasibility of the process at a practical level. Presently, the stability of available catalysts is far from application requirements, i.e., >1000 h with a high current density of 200 mA cm−2. This is because the catalyst surface gets deactivated due to poisoning by intermediates, surface reduction or dissolution of the active components.
• The low solubility of CO2 in aqueous solution is a hurdle in the activity of the catalyst. Therefore, new attempts should be made to develop proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) such as electrocatalytic reactors that can work with humidified CO2. The use of the gas diffusion electrode (GDE) configuration aims to solve the problem of mass transport, although there is a long way to go to attain stability and selectivity of the catalyst.
With the rational design of catalysts by tuning their facets, structure, shape and composition, unparalleled advancements in ECR can be achieved, which can fulfil our dream of sustainable energy.
