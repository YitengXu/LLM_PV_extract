    , Accepted 3rd June 2014First published on 3rd June 2014AbstractThe highly desirable combination of the visible light absorption properties of In1−xGaxN Quantum dots (QD) along with the multifunctionality of ZnO into a single integrated material was prepared for solar harvesting. This is the first report on InGaN QD integrated with ZnO (InGaN@ZnO), synthesized by a highly reproducible, simple combustion method in 15 min. Structural, microstructural and electronic integration of the nitride and oxide components of InGaN@ZnO was demonstrated by appropriate characterization methods. Self-assembly of InGaN QD is induced in growing nascent zinc oxo nanoclusters taking advantage of the common wurtzite structure and nitrogen incorporation at the expense of oxygen vacancies. Direct integration brings about a single phase structure exhibiting extensive visible light absorption and high photostability. InGaN@ZnO suggests synergistic operation of light harvesting and charge conducting components for solar H2 generation without using any co-catalyst or sacrificial agent, and a promising photocurrent generation at 0 V under visible light illumination. The present study suggests a direct integration of QD with the host matrix and is a potential method to realize the advantages of QDs.
1. Introduction
Harvesting abundant solar energy is a possible potential solution for the ever increasing clean energy/fuel demands.1–3 Research efforts in utilizing solar energy have increased steadily over the last decade to produce H2 from water splitting reaction (WSR) and the increasing number of review publications is evident of this.4–6 To begin with, materials with optical band-gaps around 1.5–2.0 eV, and appropriate band edge potentials are very important to absorb the entire visible light range (400–700 nm) to tap sunlight for the WSR.7,8 Upon photon absorption and charge carrier generation, it is essential to separate electrons and holes, and diffuse them to the relevant sites, where it can help to generate H2 or power. Minimization of defects and extensive electronic integration of active components enhances charge carrier utilisation. From this perspective, quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as promising candidates9–12 with their inherent advantages, such as high absorption cross section, multiple exciton generation. To realize the above inherent advantages of QDs, it is essential to rationally design the material such that the QD and host matrix are integrated for facilitating charge separation and transport.13
In1−xGaxN (InGaN) dominates research in the optoelectronics field for its defect tolerant nature, photostability with tuneable band-gap from 3.4 to 1.4 eV to absorb the entire range of the solar spectrum exhibiting potential for a rainbow solar cell.14 Nevertheless, synthesis of InGaN-QDs poses difficulties due to the different ionic radii of In3+ (0.84 Å) and Ga3+ (0.61 Å), and hence large lattice strain of InGaN.15 Many sophisticated thin film growth techniques have been utilized to grow InGaN,16–21 and no simple method is available to date. Further, InGaN thin films grown on various substrates demonstrate limited success in practical applications due to detrimental problems associated with the preparation methods and challenges in reproducibility.22 Recent exploration on thin films of InGaN grown on GaN substrate for water splitting demands make use of a noble metal cocatalyst to achieve considerable activity.23 Large visible light absorption by InGaN alone does not show a significant photoresponse, implying the intrinsic nature of poor charge utilization by InGaN.24 On the other hand, ZnO is known for fast electron conduction,25 but its exploration in solar light harvesting has been hindered due to its wide band gap (3.37 eV), limiting its use exclusively in UV light, and deleterious photocorrosion. Solid solution formation of structurally similar GaN26–29 or InN30 with ZnO could bring visible light absorption. Nonetheless, an idea to integrate ZnO and InGaN might work to tap sunlight at the expense of the above shortcomings and it is worth exploring. Despite the efforts attempted so far, there is no report on achieving a solid solution or a thin film growth of an integrated material that consists of ZnO and InGaN. For the first time, we report InGaN-QDs in ZnO (InGaN@ZnO), which is structurally and electronically integrated into a single material and evaluated for solar light harvesting. The material is successfully synthesized by a simple solution combustion method (SCM) in 15 minutes. In situ production of ammonia acts as a nitrogen source creating an effective reducing environment for forming nitrides of In and Ga. Direct evidence on the structural and electronic integration aspects of InGaN@ZnO is provided by XRD, HRTEM, XPS, Raman, absorption and emission spectroscopies, and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). InGaN@ZnO exhibits an entire visible light absorption, and up to 3–4 orders of magnitude higher photostability than that of ZnO. Synergetic operation of light harvesting by InGaN and catalytic and electron conduction components by ZnO in the closest proximity makes InGaN@ZnO a unique material. This aspect is exploited for visible light induced dehydrogenation of 2-butanol, H2 generation from overall WSR (OWSR) without using any sacrificial agent or co-catalyst, and promising solar photocurrent generation at zero bias under illumination of a 20 mW cm−2 AM1.5G source. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on highly reproducible solid state synthesis of QDs within 15 minutes, distinguished from various solution-based processes dominating to date.9,31 The present study suggests direct integration of QD with the host matrix is a potential method of realizing the advantages of QDs. The study forms part of various efforts from our laboratories to synthesize rationally designed photocatalytic materials.32
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials synthesis
One pot solution combustion synthesis was adopted, wherein urea decomposition produces a high flux of in situ ammonia that acts as the nitrogen source for instantaneous nitridation of metal oxo clusters.27b Indium nitrate and gallium nitrate (both from Sigma Aldrich), zinc nitrate and urea (both from Merck) were used as received. Urea to indium + zinc + gallium nitrates molar ratio was kept constant at 5. Required amounts of zinc nitrate hexahydrate, gallium nitrate hydrate, indium nitrate hydrate and urea were dissolved in 10 ml of water and stirred constantly until a homogeneous solution was formed. The above homogeneous solution was kept inside a muffle furnace, which was pre-heated and maintained at 500 °C. The voluminous combustion process occurs, after water boils off in the first few minutes, and leads to InGaN@ZnO. Depending upon the composition, the colour of the material varies from yellow, dark yellow, deep orange to reddish orange. Examples on specific amounts of the starting materials along with respective codes are given in Table 1. The material can be prepared with high reproducibility and the same was confirmed at least 50 times. The material remains stable at ambient conditions for at least one year. Examples on specific amounts of the starting materials along with their respective codes are given in Table 1. The materials are designated as IxGy, where x and y are variables and indicate nominal inputs of In and Ga in mol%, respectively. Similarly, solid solutions of GaN in ZnO and InN in ZnO are designated as Gx and Iy, respectively, with x or y indicating the nominal Ga or In mol%, respectively. A plausible mechanism for formation of InGaN@ZnO is provided in the supporting material (ESI-1), which is similar to our earlier report on solid solutions of GaN in ZnO.27,29,30

2.2. Characterisation methods
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data of InGaN@ZnO materials was recorded from a PANalytical X'pert Pro dual goniometer X-ray diffractometer. The data were collected with a step size of 0.02° at a scan rate of 0.5° min−1. XPS measurement was made using a custom built ambient pressure XPS system from Prevac, Poland, and equipped with a VG Scienta SAX 100 emission controller monochromator using an Al Kα anode (1486.6 eV) in transmission lens mode.33 The photoelectrons were energy analyzed using VG Scienta's R3000 differentially pumped analyzer. The spectra were recorded at a pass energy of 50 eV. SIMS images were recorded with an ION-TOF instrument. A Bi3+ primary ion source was utilized for adopting a well distinguished fragmentation and the sputtered fragments were identified by a coupled mass spectrometer. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) measurements of InGaN@ZnO were carried out in a FEI TECNAI 3010 electron microscope operating at 300 kV (Cs 1/4 0.6 mm, resolution 1.7 Å). Samples were powdered and dispersed in isopropanol solvent before being depositing onto a gold coated carbon grid.
UV-Vis absorption measurements of the powders were collected on a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Model UV-2550) with spectral-grade BaSO4 as the reference material. UV-Visible absorption for all materials were collected in the same instrument with water as reference. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were performed using a Photon Technology International spectrophotometer equipped with a Hg–Cd source at room temperature under excitation light of 330 nm. The conditions were maintained to compare the photocatalytic conditions. Raman spectra were recorded on a Horiba JY LabRAM HR 800 Raman spectrometer coupled with a microscope in reflectance mode with a 633 nm excitation laser source and a spectral resolution of 0.3 cm−1. Thermal analyses of materials were recorded by Perkin-Elmer Diamond's thermogravimetry (TG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) with alumina as the internal standard. Infrared spectra were obtained using a Bruker α-T spectrophotometer in the range of 4000–400 cm−1. Chemical analysis of solid materials and for Zn-leaching due to photocorrosion was measured by an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) instrument. After continuous light irradiation, the reactant mixture was filtered thoroughly and analysed by ICP using Ar as carrier gas.
2.3. Solar harvesting application studies

2.3a Photocatalytic dehydrogenation of 2-butanol. 
30 mg of any InGaN@ZnO composition was suspended in 20 ml of reactant solution comprising 4 ml of 2-butanol and 16 ml of water. The suspended solution was taken in an air tight 50 ml round bottom flask and irradiated for 2.5 h under visible light irradiation from a standard source of Oriel 300 W with a visible band pass cut-off filter passing wavelength above 400 nm. Air circulation was employed to maintain a constant temperature (27 °C) during irradiation. After 2.5 h the solution was filtered and the filtrate was subjected to product analysis. Indeed from the complete miscible solution to immiscible organic layer formation after irradiation demonstrates the formation of a hydrophobic organic compound. The product was separated by a separating funnel. On product analysis it was confirmed that the organic layer contains exclusively 2-butanone.


2.3b H2 generation from overall water splitting. 
40 mg of InGaN@ZnO was suspended in 40 ml of reactant aqueous solution adjusted to pH 4.5 containing H2SO4. The suspended solution was taken in an air tight 50 ml volume round bottom flask and irradiated for 4 h with visible light irradiation. An Oriel instruments solar simulator equipped with a 300 W xenon arc lamp system with an AM1.5 cut-off filter as irradiation source was employed. Cool air circulation was employed to maintain a constant temperature (27 °C) during irradiation. After 4 h, gas analysis was carried out by an online GC equipped with a TCD detector (Agilent 7890) for quantitative analysis.


2.3c Photocurrent generation studies. 
Photocurrent generation using semiconductor materials as the working electrode is of great interest.5 PEC studies on the new materials were carried out using Gamry potentiostat instruments (Model 3000 potentiostat/Galvanostat/ZRA) in a conventional three-electrode test cell with Ag/AgCl as reference electrode and a platinum foil as the counter electrode, in 0.5 M lithium perchlorate aqueous solution with neutral pH (pH = 7.3) as supporting electrolyte medium at ambient temperature (25 °C). InGaN@ZnO coated on FTO plate was used as the working photoelectrode. FTO plates were cleaned thoroughly and the powder slurry made by 5 mg of powder in 1 ml of isopropanol drop casted on to the electrode surface and dried at room temperature. This electrode was used as the working electrode for all the electrochemical studies. The irradiation source was an Oriel instruments 300 W Xenon arc lamp adapted with various filters such as AM1.5 filter, visible band pass (VBP) filter allowing wavelengths from 380 nm to 770 nm and other cut-off filters at specific wavelengths 400, 455, 510, 550 and 610 nm. The band pass filters were from the Newport corporation.
Liner sweep voltammetry measurements were recorded under continuous light irradiation with VBP filter allowing 80% transmittance in the spectral range from 380 nm to 770 nm at the scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in the potential sweep from −0.5 to 0.5 V, and the same conditions in the dark also. This voltage range was followed because of the material stability. The irradiance power with use of filters was checked by a LUX meter.
Chronoamperometry measurements were recorded at 0 V using the same irradiation source and with the filters mentioned above. The immediate response for shutter oscillation highlights the photofunctional behaviour of the material. Over the entire period of time of shutter opening the current remains constant demonstrating the current production is exclusively due to the photoresponse of InGaN@ZnO. IPCE for various samples has been calculated from the current density obtained and the incident flux measured with different filters.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural integration aspects of InGaN@ZnO
Investigation on the structural features of InGaN@ZnO was carried out by PXRD and the results are compared with that of ZnO (Fig. 1). Very similar diffraction patterns of hexagonal Wurtzite ZnO was observed for all InGaN@ZnO, without any impurity features. Unless otherwise specified, the number followed by I and G in the material code gives the nominal mol% of In and Ga, respectively. ZnO0.914N0.086 (UZ5)26 show a marginal shift in XRD features to a higher angle. However, Fig. 1 reveals that there is peak shift to lower angles for all InGaN@ZnO compositions compared to pure ZnO. A dotted line indicates the extent of peak shift to lower angles with different compositions of In and Ga. Irrespective of In and Ga content, a shift to lower angles observed in the XRD indicates the dominance of the In size effect over Ga. As the ionic radius of In3+ is bigger than Zn2+ (0.72 Å) or Ga3+, the peak positions shifts increasingly to lower angles on increasing the In-content. It is also to be underscored that the peak shifts to lower angles even with high Ga-content hints that the maximum amount of the nominal input amount of In is retained in the structure. The simultaneous incorporation of bigger (In3+) and smaller (Ga3+) ions in place of Zn2+ in near neighbour lattice sites affords the advantage of compensating effects of lattice expansion and contraction, respectively, with each other, minimizing the lattice distortion in ZnO. Thus the solubility limit of total dopant (In + Ga) content increases, compared to the solubility limit of individual InN (8%) and GaN (10%) in ZnO.29,30 Up to 8% In and 15% Ga, the XRD shows no features corresponding to In2O3 and/or Ga2O3, highlighting the solubility of In and Ga as nitrides in ZnO under combustion synthesis conditions (see ESI-1†).

The critical and direct microstructural evidence for the formation of InGaN QDs can be found by identification of their characteristic lattice d-spacing in HRTEM analysis. Well resolved high resolution images of lattice planes of I5G8 composition are shown in Fig. 2a and b; lattice d-spacings are shown with different In and Ga compositions in Fig. ESI-2.† HRTEM image of the present material comprises lattice planes with two different contrasts; the black contrast area is identified as InGaN with a d100-spacing of 0.2998 nm. This is further supported by statistical line profile analysis recorded in the area indicated by InGaN (Fig. 2d); the very regular 0.3 nm space between successive peaks observed underscores the presence of InGaN QDs embedded in the ZnO matrix. Nonetheless, d100-value changes, in the nearby area with a grey contrast, to 0.282 nm in the same lattice plane (Fig. 2b), and this corresponds to ZnO (100) plane. The interpenetrating lattice regime between InGaN and ZnO, indicated by the white oval shape in Fig. 2b, shows a seamless change from predominant nitride nature at the centre of Fig. 2b to ZnO at the top right corner without an abrupt interface. The same region is analysed using statistical line profile analysis and it is given in Fig. 2e. An onset of ZnO penetrating into the InGaN region is evident from a gradual increase in d100 value from 0.282 nm (within the dotted square in Fig. 2e) to higher values towards 0.3 nm is evident in Fig. 2e. Hence the presence of InGaN QDs structurally integrated with ZnO lattice is supported by characteristic changes in d-values. InGaN particle size distribution measured from TEM images (Fig. ESI-2e and f†) is given in Fig. 2c for I5G8. 25 nm size particles are observed predominantly with a size variation between 10 and 35 nm. It is also to be noted that this size includes the diffused regime of ZnO into InGaN and hence the actual size would be likely to be smaller by 2–5 nm from the values shown in Fig. 2c. Indeed this is also a reason for the significant shift in diffraction features observed in Fig. 1. Particle sizes less than 10 nm cannot be ruled out, but their abundance is very low in I5G8, for the above reason of structural integration aspects.
 Fig. 2  (a–b) HRTEM images of (100) lattice planes of InGaN (d ≅ 0.3 nm) (dark portion) and ZnO (d = 0.282 nm) (grey portion). (c) Particle size distribution measured from TEM analysis is given for I5G8. The dark portion in the bottom half of (a), indicated by a square, is enlarged in (b). Corresponding line profile analysis for InGaN and the (oval shape) interpenetrating junction of ZnO and InGaN in (b) is given in panels (d) and (e), respectively. Panel (d) shows a regular d100-value (0.3 nm) highlighting the InGaN quantum dot regime. A gradual increase in d100 value (0.283–0.287 nm) was observed with an increased line broadening suggesting the onset of penetration of ZnO into InGaN from right to left in panel (e). 
To establish the existence and mode of distribution of nitride components in the ZnO matrix, direct imaging of molecular fragments on the surface of InGaN@ZnO was probed by SIMS analysis after initial sputtering. Fig. 3a–c displays the SIMS mapping images of critical fragments of I5G5, namely InGaN, ZnGaN and ZnInN. Similar results obtained for I2G2 are given in Fig. ESI-3.† A fairly homogeneous distribution of InGaN and ZnGaN fragments is evident from Fig. 3a and b, respectively. Although, ZnInN also shows a homogeneous distribution (Fig. 3c), 5–7 times lower counts were observed compared to the other two fragments. These observations are very significant in terms of the direct observation of the quantum chemical components of the nitride fragments. Foremost is the presence of InGaN, which is the key evidence for the formation of InGaN@ZnO. About a five times larger amount of InGaN than ZnInN suggesting the preference of In to Ga, rather than In to Zn; this is expected, as it would better reduce the lattice strain of InGaN15 as well as the host ZnO lattice, and facilitates the formation of InGaN@ZnO. Furthermore, the highest count observed with ZnGaN hints at the preference of Zn towards Ga and the presence of GaN is also observed.
 Fig. 3  Microstructural integration of InGaN quantum dots with ZnO has been demonstrated through SIMS fragment mapping of I5G5 of critical masses corresponding to (a) InGaN+, (b) ZnGaN+, and (c) ZnInN+. 
However, the same argument is not true with InN, since ZnInN shows the least counts. In general, various nitride containing fragment mapping hints the InGaN QDs are structurally embedded into the ZnO matrix. These observations suggest the nitrogen from nitride is the key component that structurally integrates InGaN with ZnO. Confirmatory results from XRD, HRTEM and SIMS suggest structural integration evolves the single phase nature of InGaN@ZnO formation.
3.2. Electronic integration aspects of InGaN@ZnO
N 1s core level of InGaN@ZnO was analysed using XPS and the results are shown in Fig. 4a. A single sharp peak at 397.1 eV is obtained for N 1s core level for all compositions of InGaN@ZnO and its intensity generally increases with the increment in In + Ga content. This peak is assigned to nitride (N3−) present in the InGaN@ZnO material and it is in good correlation with the literature reports.33a,b No other N 1s peak was observed highlighting that nitrogen is present exclusively as nitride; whereas, N-doping in ZnO shows N-atoms similar to that of ammonia or amines, which is not present in InGaN@ZnO. On Zn0.92Ga0.08O0.88N0.115 (G8),29 nitride also appears, in addition to the ammonia feature. This also supports that substitutional N-doping as N3− can abstract the maximum electron density than any other type of nitrogen species. Further assistance in charge compensation and replacement of oxygen vacancies can be effectively accomplished by N3−-type features.
 Fig. 4  Electronic integration of InGaN quantum dots with ZnO. (a) XPS of N 1s core level, and (b) Raman spectra of InGaN@ZnO materials with different compositions, and compared with reference materials. Note the observation of nitride formation with all InGaN@ZnO in XPS and Raman results. 
Nitride components of InGaN@ZnO are identified by its characteristic vibrational frequencies from Raman spectral analysis (Fig. 4b). Results are compared with Raman spectra of ZnO, UZ5 and Zn0.92In0.08O0.85N0.15 (I8). A prominent E2(high) feature was observed at 437 cm−1 for ZnO and UZ5, which is characteristic for Wurtzite phase; however, InN or InGaN introduction shifts this feature to 430 cm−1 with peak broadening. Characteristic E2(high) of InN (490 cm−1)34 and GaN (579 cm−1)35 demonstrates the presence of both components in InGaN@ZnO.
In addition, a broad feature centred between 575 and 600 cm−1 corresponds to typical metal nitrides, especially A1LO of In-rich InxGa1−xN.36 A sharp feature at 708 cm−1 confirms the presence of Wurtzite In–N (A1LO and E1LO mode of InN). Local vibration modes of Zn–N was observed at 273 cm−1,37 and this was not observed with G8 or I8.29,30 Zn–N feature and A1LO of In-rich InGaN suggests the electronic integration of InGaN and ZnO and nitride feature is likely to be at the interface. Preliminary EXAFS investigations on local structure of Ga in InGaN@ZnO supports a single phase structure depicting the co-ordination number of Ga is 4 matching that of Ga in InGaN.

Fig. 5a displays absorption spectra of InGaN@ZnO and reference materials. Onset of visible light absorption between 650 and 700 nm is observed with all InGaN@ZnO compositions; absorption coefficient increases with increasing In and Ga contents. Although G8 absorbs visible light up to 550 nm, a marked increase in absorption with I1G1 up to the orange region with an extended absorption up to 650 nm highlights the importance of InGaN QD as light harvesting antennae. I2G2 shows absorption up to 700 nm. I5G2 and other compositions show enhanced absorption compared to I2G2 at all wavelengths in visible light as well as into the near-IR regime. A comparison of the solar spectrum with the absorption spectra of InGaN@ZnO suggests a maximum overlap in absorption from violet to green (∼550 nm) regions highlighting the possibility of absorption of high flux visible light photons of the solar spectrum. As the material absorption spans from UV to the visible regime, the minimum criteria for working in rainbow solar cells is fulfilled by InGaN@ZnO.38 The absorption spectra of InGaN@ZnO is continuous suggesting the structural compatibility with electronic integration of the individual components, and completely eliminates the chances of being a physical mixture of individual components. Inset in Fig. 5a shows a photograph for the colour associated with InGaN@ZnO and fully supports the reduction in optical band gap to 1.8 eV. Consideration of the absorption spectrum of UZ5 suggests the visible light absorption is exclusively due to nitride features in InGaN@ZnO. Indeed, N 2p states of N3− decreases the optical band gap indicating the broadening of valence band (VB) in InGaN@ZnO. N3− doping is reported to be essential for the formation of shallow acceptor levels arising in p-type conductivity in ZnO.39 Theoretical and experimental findings on the formation of shallow electronic levels due to nitride postulate favourable overlapping of 2p bands of N and O,40 and as a result optical band gap reduction occurs in InGaN@ZnO. The materials retain absorption even after calcination at 500 °C; however, calcination at 800 °C, oxidizes nitrides to oxides and the results are given in ESI-4.† This result is further supported by TG/DTA analysis wherein significant weight gain is observed only above 700 °C due to oxidation of nitride to oxide and it is shown in ESI-5.†
 Fig. 5  (a) UV-Visible absorption, and (b) photoluminescence emission spectra of InGaN@ZnO materials with different compositions. Absorption and emission spectrum of ZnO is also included for comparison. Note the significant visible light absorption at 700 nm (in a), and no green emission feature at 540 nm, corresponding to oxygen vacancies (in b), observed for InGaN@ZnO. 
To further understand the electronic structure of InGaN@ZnO, emission spectra were recorded with an excitation wavelength at 325 nm (Fig. 5b). Near band edge emission was observed at 380 nm for InGaN@ZnO as in ZnO.41 Room temperature PL result of reference ZnO is also given in Fig. 5b. Note the entirely different emission features for ZnO and InGaN@ZnO. Similar emission features were observed for all InGaN@ZnO compositions with two sharp features at 420 and 440 nm and a shoulder at 480 nm, and these features are assigned to InGaN.42 As the new emission features appear at higher λ than the ZnO band edge emission, the formation of new bands are suggested to be just above the VB. Indeed, extended visible light absorption up to 700 nm fully supports the broadening of VB in InGaN@ZnO. Further support is available from the emission peak observed around 740–770 nm due to InGaN in InGaN@ZnO (see Fig. ESI-6†). An important feature to be underscored is the absence of green emission around 520 nm from InGaN@ZnO, which is prominently observed for ZnO, mainly due to O-vacancies.43 Oxygen and nitrogen vacancies are noted as trap states in ZnO and nitride materials, respectively. In general, emission from such trap states are characteristically broad in nature.44 In fact, O-vacancies are principally responsible for photocorrosion by leaching Zn2+, and the absence of broad green emission addresses the anti-photocorrosion45 nature of InGaN@ZnO. The intriguing phenomenon of suppression of O-vacancies is likely due to the effective nitride substitution at the expense of O-vacancies during the ZnxOy clusters growth under combustion conditions.
In support of the above spectroscopic evidence, suppression of photocorrosion is further verified by deliberate UV illumination of InGaN@ZnO continuously for 48 h with a 400 W Hg-lamp. A mere 1.5 ± 0.5 ppm Zn2+ was observed after 48 h irradiation of any InGaN@ZnO; whereas, ZnO shows 185 ppm after just 6 h illumination. There is no trace of In3+ and Ga3+ ion in the examined solution, after 48 h irradiation, for which the degree of leaching is below the detection limit. Up to 3–4 orders of magnitude decrease in photocorrosion suggests the suppression of O-vacancies (see ESI-7†). The absorption analysis of the spent catalyst irradiated over 48 h is given in ESI-4.† It is to be noted that there is only a marginal difference in absorption between fresh and spent catalyst highlighting the anti-photocorrosive nature of the material.
3.3. Photocurrent generation

Fig. 6a displays linear sweep voltammograms of InGaN@ZnO recorded under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 400 nm). We maintained neutral pH throughout the reactions.44 ZnO furnishes <1 μA cm−2, mainly due to absorption by O-defects. However, InGaN@ZnO exhibits a dramatic increase in photocurrent generation and the response increases up to 50 μA cm−2 at 0 V with a gradual increases in In + Ga content; similarly, the photocurrent increases from 25 to 60 μA cm−2 at 0.5 V. The photoresponse of InGaN@ZnO lies in the fact of enhanced visible light absorption with notable absorbance values. Hence the visible light photoresponse is solely attributed to InGaN QDs due to the above factors. We observed two orders of magnitude enhancement in visible light photocurrent generation at 0 V with InGaN@ZnO than ZnO. Considering ZnO, which is only a UV active material, the enhancement in photocurrent for InGaN@ZnO under visible light irradiation at zero voltage (0 V) conditions is noteworthy.45 According to literature reports, the aspect of visible light absorption by InGaN alone does not show a significant photoresponse implying the intrinsic nature of the poor charge utilization by InGaN.24 Structurally integrated InGaN with ZnO brings the electronic coupling of light harvesters with fast conducting ZnO. The enhancement is attributed to the synergistic operation of visible light harvesting by InGaN QDs and charge carrier conduction by ZnO. Incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) calculated for I5G8 varies from 7.5% (VBP), 2.23% (455 nm), 0.75% (510 nm) and 0.52% (610 nm) with different cut-off wavelengths given in parentheses (Table 2). The values obtained for each sample with the range of incident wavelengths is given in Table 2. Linear sweep voltammogram of I5G5 and I5G8 materials exhibit increments in both cathodic and anodic currents implying p-type as well as n-type conductivity.46 It is also to be underscored here that neither solid solution of GaN in ZnO or InN in ZnO produces more than 2–3 μA cm−2 under the above conditions.

A stable photoresponse is further confirmed by chronoamperometry measurements at 0 V, with different cut-off filters (Fig. 6b and c). Indeed extensive visible light absorption and efficient conversion of light energy into current highlights the potential nature of the materials to act as rainbow solar cells. Current values decrease gradually with increasing cut-off wavelength. Although, the magnitude of the photocurrent is small at the 610 nm filter, it indicates the effective absorption of high wavelength light underscoring the In-rich nature of InGaN@ZnO.
3.4. Photocatalysis studies
Unlike TiO2, ZnO-based photocatalysts are less effective for the water splitting reaction even under UV light, since photocorrosion makes it unsustainable. We demonstrate the applicability of InGaN@ZnO for dehydrogenation of 2-butanol to 2-butanone, and overall water splitting reaction under a visible light irradiation source, and indeed they are the ultimate Litmus test. Table 3 displays the yield of 2-butanone with different InGaN@ZnO compositions. The highest 2-butanone yield (56%) was observed with I5G8; I5Gy (y = 2–8) shows a 2-butanone yield around 50%. ZnO shows negligible activity under the above reaction conditions. Exclusive 2-butanone formation is confirmed by IR and UV results (shown in ESI-8†). Catalyst recyclability tests have also been carried out for six cycles with I5G8 and the result is given in ESI-8,† which shows the retention of conversion/yield in all cycles within the error limit of 2%.

Photocatalytic H2 generation results from the overall water splitting under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 400 nm) with various InGaN@ZnO is shown in Table 3. H2 yield varies from 17 to 66 μmol h−1 g−1. Oxygen yield is about 50% that of H2 yield, confirming the OWSR. Likely, this is the first report to show significantly large amounts of H2 from ZnO-based catalysts in visible light from OWSR. It is also to be emphasized here that the results shown in Table 3 were obtained without using any co-catalyst or noble metal clusters and underscores the importance of bare InGaN@ZnO photocatalyst. A comparison of the present H2 generation activity with related materials such as, solid solutions of ZnO in GaN, thin films of InGaN on GaN substrate, oxynitrides shows negligible H2 yield without using a cocatalyst.23,47 High activity associated with the present InGaN@ZnO towards visible light driven photocatalysis is attributed to synergistic interaction of light harvesting by InGaN QDs and fast electron conduction as well as its utilisation by ZnO. Particularly, water splitting demonstrates the CBmin is above the hydrogen reduction potential (0 eV; NHE) indicating the nature of CB remains as that of ZnO. Absorption and emission studies demonstrate the broadening of VB is due to nitride features and is responsible for the visible light driven activity.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, our attempt to synthesise single phase InGaN QDs integrated with ZnO was successful; it is also important to highlight the synthesis of QDs by solid state synthesis within 15 minutes from cheap raw materials. Structural similarity of InGaN and ZnO and the minimization of lattice distortion are the prime reasons for the formation of InGaN@ZnO. Structural evidences support the formation of InGaN QDs and homogeneous distribution in ZnO. Direct interconnection of InGaN with ZnO bring the light harvesting component and charge conducting component in close vicinity with each other for effective conversion of light energy into current or chemical energy. The present strategy has the potential to stimulate other combinations from the related families of semiconductors.
The materials exhibit extensive visible light absorption from the UV regime up to 700 nm with high photostability demonstrating solar light harvesting. Structural and electronic integration in InGaN@ZnO leads to a synergistic operation and the same was exploited for visible light driven photocatalysis without any sacrificial agents or cocatalyst, and zero bias (0 V) photocurrent generation. Extensive absorption and efficient conversion of light energy into current or chemical energy highlights the potential of InGaN@ZnO for a variety of optoelectronic applications such as quantum dot sensitized solar cells, dye sensitized solar cells, tandem solar cells, photodetectors, etc.
