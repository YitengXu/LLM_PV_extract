    , Accepted 17th February 2019First published on 18th February 2019AbstractAqueous rechargeable batteries are attractive because of their low cost, high operational safety and environmental benignity. Bismuth (Bi) with a highly reversible redox reaction and suitable negative working window has been investigated as a promising anode material recently. However, reported Bi anodes are still far from satisfactory because of their limited capacity and poor stability. Herein, self-supported ultrathin Bi nanosheets have been acquired by a very simple strategy of in situ topotactic transformation using BiOCl as the primary template (named T-BiNS). According to theoretical calculation, the space that T-BiNS has left after the release of O and Cl atoms is sufficient for the reversible charge/discharge process of Bi ↔ Bi2O3. The huge space and the unique structure enhance rapid electron transfer, reduce the activation energy and improve the stability. As such, T-BiNS shows a high capacity of 366 mA h g−1 (almost reaching a theoretical capacity of 384.7 mA h g−1) and good stability with a capacity retention of 82% after 5000 cycles. Finally, a NiCo2O4//T-BiNS full battery is fabricated, which exhibits a high energy density of 116 W h kg−1.
1. Introduction
Employing inexpensive and reliable electricity generated from renewable and clean energy sources is the final destination for our society. Electrical energy storage (EES) offers a key approach to realize grid reliability since renewable energy sources including wind, solar, tidal and geothermal are all inherently intermittent and generally dispersed.1 Additionally, EES is also in urgent need because of the fast-growing energy demand in the areas of electric vehicles, mobile electronics, etc.2,3 Li-ion batteries (LIBs) have been a protagonist for decades due to their versatility. However, the increasing concerns about the risk of resource shortage, high cost, environmental problems and safety issues strongly limit their further development in the near future.4 As such, aqueous rechargeable batteries (ARBs) are regarded as new energy storage device candidates because of their remarkable advantages of high ionic conductivity, safety, environmental benignity and low cost.5–8 To date, various types of ARBs including Zn ion batteries,5–9 alkali-ion batteries,10,11 Ni or Co//metal batteries,12–14 and other metal-ion batteries such as Al3+ batteries15,16 have been widely explored. In particular, aqueous rechargeable Ni or Co//metal batteries such as NiCo//Zn,17 Co3O4//Zn,18 Co//Zn19 and Ni//FeOx (ref. 13 and 20) based on faradaic reactions are emerging as favorable energy storage devices because of their superiority of high energy, small environmental footprint and economic viability. Unfortunately, the intrinsically poor conductivity of both cathode and anode materials in most current Ni or Co//metal batteries hampers their commercial application.12–14,20 For anode materials, the employment of a metal Zn anode seems attractive because of its high theoretical capacity of 820 mA h g−1 and considerable efforts have been devoted to the development of various Ni//Zn batteries recently. However, the challenge of Zn dendrite growth resulting from the high solubility of Zn during the discharge process hinders the widespread application of Ni or Co//Zn batteries seriously.4,9,21
Bismuth has emerged as an attractive anode material recently due to its highly reversible redox reaction, suitable negative working window, and inexpensive and eco-friendly nature.6,14,22,23 For example, a capacity of 96.2 mA h g−1 was acquired by dendritic Bi nanostructures at 4.5 A g−1, and the corresponding full Ni//Bi battery delivered a maximum energy density of 85.8 W h kg−1.14 Additionally, the Bi2O3 electrode showed a high capacity of 357 mA h g−1 at 0.72C (248.8 mA g−1) and the assembled LiMn2O4//Bi2O3 full cell exhibited an energy density of ∼78 W h kg−1. However, the capacity decreased obviously only within 200 cycles.23 Thus, the long-term durability and capacity of Bi electrodes still need further boosting.
Herein, unique self-supported ultrathin bismuth nanosheets were acquired by in situ topotactic transformation. According to theoretical calculation, the space left by the release of O and Cl atoms after topotactic transformation for T-BiNS is 57.6% (corresponding to Bi), which is much larger than that for Bi2O3 reduction (19.2%). Thus, there was sufficient space for T-BiNS expansion during the charge/discharge process of Bi ↔ Bi2O3. The huge space and unique structure enhanced rapid electron transfer, lowered the activation energy and improved the stability.24–26 Therefore, T-BiNS showed a high capacity of 366 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 and superior stability with a capacity retention of 82% after 5000 cycles. Finally, the assembled NiCo2O4//T-BiNS full battery delivered a high energy density of 116 W h kg−1 at a power density of 780 W kg−1.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Material preparation

Preparation of BiOCl and T-BiNS. 
Before the preparation of T-BiNS, BiOCl was firstly fabricated. Typically, 0.97 g of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and 0.268 g of NH4Cl were added to 50 mL ethylene glycol, which then was stirred for 30 min. Subsequently, the solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with a capacity of 100 mL and Ti foil with a size of 3 cm × 6 cm and thickness of 0.1 mm was immersed into the solution. The autoclave was heated at 180 °C and remained at this temperature for 20 h, and then cooled down to room temperature. Finally, the BiOCl product grown on the Ti foil was washed with deionized water and then dried in an oven at 60 °C. The T-BiNS was obtained through the reduction of the prepared BiOCl, which was achieved by controlled cyclic voltammetry (CV) with the potential scanned to −1.5 V. The mass was calculated to be 1.2 mg cm−2 through calculating the difference in weight before and after T-BiNS loading.


Preparation of the control materials of Bi and Bi2O3 nanosheets. 
A pure Bi sample was prepared by the electrodeposition method, which was conducted in a solution (60 mL) containing 1 g Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and 10 mL 4 M HCl. A Ti substrate (the same size as before) was immersed into the solution and the potential was kept at −1 V for 50 s. After the electrodeposition, the sample was washed with deionized water and dried at 60 °C in air. The Bi2O3 nanosheets grown on the Ti substrate were prepared by a facile hydrothermal route using Bi(NO3)3·5H2O as the raw material. In detail, a piece of Ti foil (the same size as before) was immersed into a mixed solution containing 40 mL of ethanol, 40 mL of ethylene glycol and 2 g of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, and then sealed in a Teflon-lined autoclave and maintained at 160 °C for 6 h. After reaction, the sample was washed with deionized water and finally dried at 60 °C for 2 h.


Preparation of the NiCo2O4 nanorod cathode. 
NiCo2O4 nanorods were fabricated through a hydrothermal method. Ti foil was placed in a Teflon-lined autoclave with 60 mL solution (50 mL deionized water and 10 mL ethanol) containing 0.1091 g Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.2138 g Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.27 g urea. The hydrothermal reaction was performed at 110 °C for 6 h, and then the product was washed and calcined at 320 °C in air for 2 h to prepare the final NiCo2O4 nanorods.

2.2 Material characterization
The morphology, microstructure, and crystal phase composition of the prepared samples were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JSM-6700F), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F) and X-ray diffractometry (XRD, PANalytical X'PertPRO). The Raman spectra were collected with a Raman spectrometer (LabRAM HR JY-Evolution, 532 nm). The in situ Raman device has been reported in our previous work.3 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (VG Multilab-2000) using a PHI Quantum 2000 XPS system with a monochromatic Al Kα source and charge neutralizer was performed to investigate the mechanism of the reaction process.
2.3 Electrochemical measurement
All the electrochemical measurements were conducted by employing an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E). A conventional three-electrode system was established to test the electrochemical performance in a 100 mL beaker, in which the prepared samples served as working electrodes, Pt foil as the counter, an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference, and 1 M KOH aqueous solution as the electrolyte. The full cell of NiCo2O4//T-BiNS was assembled in a pouch cell with a NKK separator in 1 M KOH solution, the cathode was connected with the working electrode of the electrochemical workstation and the anode was connected with the reference and counter electrodes. The size of T-BiNS was 1 cm × 1 cm in the three-electrode system and the size ratio of the anode and cathode electrodes in the full cell was calculated to be 1:1.3 according to the capacity ratio of T-BiNS and NiCo2O4.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Material fabrication and characterization
The SEM image in Fig. 1a demonstrates that the size of the prepared BiOCl nanosheet is 2–5 μm and the thickness is about 50–200 nm. The TEM image with the corresponding SAED pattern shown in Fig. 1b taken from one piece of the BiOCl nanosheets and the enlarged high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image from the selected area reveal that the nanosheets have high single crystallinity and their largest exposed surfaces are {001} facets. This has been further confirmed by the side view of TEM observation (Fig. S1 in the ESI†). Fig. 1d presents the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the initial BiOCl in the potential range of −1.5–0.2 V at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. It is obvious that the reduction peak of the first cycle is quite different from that of the second and the third cycle. XRD was performed to investigate the reaction mechanism in the first reduction (Fig. 1e). It is found that the initially prepared BiOCl (JCPDS: 06-0249) has been transformed into rhombohedral Bi (JCPDS: 44-1246). The inset illustrates the crystal structure transformation process of BiOCl into Bi and also presents that Cl and O atoms were released from the BiOCl crystal. The following curves of the second and the third cycle are the same as some previous reports and the redox peaks correspond to the reversible process of Bi ↔ Bi2O3.14,23 Till now, the chemical mechanism of this material is clear and can be described as:

Most remarkably, it seems that there was no significant compromise or degradation for the microstructure during this reductive transformation despite the considerably different atomic arrangements between tetragonal BiOCl and rhombohedral Bi. SEM images in Fig. 1f and the corresponding enlarged image in Fig. 1g show that the reduced Bi retains the 2D nanosheet morphology and the nanosheets supported themselves. Compared to the BiOCl nanosheet template, Bi nanosheets appear to be much smaller and thinner. The size is less than 200 nm and the thickness is less than 10 nm. The TEM image of Bi shows that the reduced nanosheets have no sign of pulverization (Fig. 1h) and there are obvious pores shown compared to that of the initial BiOCl template (Fig. 1b). The pores are attributed to the space between Bi nanosheets and resulted from the release of Cl and O atoms. The corresponding SAED pattern (inset of Fig. 1h) shows that it has a single-crystal-like structure and the mainly exposed surfaces are {001} facets. High-resolution TEM analysis reveals obvious lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.23 nm, corresponding to the {110} planes of rhombohedral Bi (Fig. 1i). The large scale and another view of SEM images for BiOCl and T-BiNS have been included in Fig. S2 in the ESI.† The nanosheets of BiOCl (Fig. S2a†) are uniform even in the large scale SEM image. It is obvious that nearly every single nanosheet in T-BiNS is constructed from ultrathin Bi nanosheets after transformation, which proves that the structural transformation is completed. The above microscopic results corroborate that Bi nanosheets preserve their 2D structural integrity, and the reductive transformation from layered tetragonal BiOCl into layered rhombohedral Bi is believed to be a kind of topotactic transformation.27–30Fig. 1j concludes that the ultrathin Bi nanosheets were acquired through the topotactic transformation of large size BiOCl nanosheets, which is the reason why the sample is named T-BiNS. According to the rough calculation from Fig. 1a and f–i, the area and the thickness of T-BiNS are only 1/500 and 1/100 those of the initial BiOCl nanosheets respectively. Thus, the simple method of topotactic transformation leads to great benefits.
3.2 Electrochemical performance of Bi, Bi2O3 and T-BiNS
Traditional Bi and Bi2O3 nanosheets were fabricated to compare with the prepared T-BiNS. The XRD patterns in Fig. S3a in the ESI† indicate that all the diffraction peaks except those of the Ti substrate are assignable to rhombohedral Bi (JCPDS: 44-1246). The SEM image in Fig. S3b† shows that the Bi nanosheets have an obvious hierarchical structure. Except for those of the Ti substrate, all the peaks in Fig. S3c† match well with those of cubic δ-Bi2O3 (JCPDS: 27-52). Thin nanosheets with a size of several hundreds of nanometers were obtained as shown in Fig. S3d.† CV curves of Bi, Bi2O3 and T-BiNS are shown in Fig. 2a at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. Compared with the oxidation (red region) and reduction (blue region) peaks of Bi and Bi2O3, the oxidation peak of T-BiNS shifts to a lower potential and the corresponding reduction peak shifts to a higher potential (marked by a dotted line), implying that T-BiNS possesses superior conductivity and lower reaction activation energy.3,31 The galvanostatic discharge curves of Bi, Bi2O3 and T-BiNS were also compared as shown in Fig. 2b at a current density of 1 A g−1. Two discharge plateaus situated at −0.65 and −0.52 V are evident for T-BiNS, consistent with the potential of the oxidation peaks shown in Fig. 2a. The capacity of T-BiNS (284 mA h g−1) is found to be much higher than that of traditionally used Bi (81 mA h g−1) and Bi2O3 (150 mA h g−1) anodes. T-BiNS was further studied and the CV curves at different scan rates and the discharge curves at various current densities are shown in Fig. S4 in the ESI.† The oxidation and reduction peaks are still distinct even when the scan rate reaches 300 mV s−1, reflecting the highly reversible redox reaction in the rapid charge/discharge process (Fig. S4a†). As shown in Fig. S4b,† the capacity is retained at 175 mA h g−1 even at a high current density of 20 A g−1. The specific capacity of Bi, Bi2O3 and T-BiNS at different current densities was summarized as shown in Fig. 2c. The maximum capacity of T-BiNS is 366 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1, which almost reaches the theoretical capacity of 384.7 mA h g−1.23 However, the performance of traditional Bi and Bi2O3 nanosheets is much worse than that of T-BiNS at all current densities, especially at high current density. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out to study the kinetics of charge and ion transport in the Bi, Bi2O3 and T-BiNS electrodes. As depicted in Fig. S4c,† in comparison with Bi and Bi2O3 electrodes, T-BiNS shows the minimum diameter of the semicircle and onset resistance, substantiating its smaller charge-transfer resistance (Rct) and series resistances (Rs).32–34 The boosted ion diffusion for T-BiNS was further characterized by the relaxation time constant (τ0, the minimum time needed to discharge all the energy from the device with an efficiency of greater than 50%) as shown in Fig. 2d.6,35 The τ0 of T-BiNS is only 1.7 s, substantially shorter than that of Bi (112 s) and Bi2O3 (56 s), which means that T-BiNS possesses the ability of rapid charge transport, efficient ion diffusion, and abundant electroactive sites. Besides the high capacity and rate performance of T-BiNS, the stability of this electrode is also superior to that of Bi and Bi2O3 as shown in Fig. 2e. The capacity is retained at 82% after 5000 cycles, but the retention is approximately 60% for traditional Bi and Bi2O3 only after 1000 and 2000 cycles respectively.

3.3 Theoretical analysis and characterization for mechanism proposal
To investigate why the prepared T-BiNS is superior, theoretical analysis was first performed. Fig. 3a shows the unit cell parameters of Bi, Bi2O3 and BiOCl. The volume of the BiOCl cell is 111.52 Å3, which contains 2 Bi, O and Cl atoms, while the volume is 212.3 Å3 (containing 6 Bi atoms) and 168.65 Å3 (containing 4 Bi and 6 O atoms) for Bi and Bi2O3 cells respectively. If we define that the final product is just 1 Bi, after normalizing, the volume of 1 Bi, 1 BiO3/2 and 1 BiOCl is 35 Å3, 42.163 Å3 and 55.76 Å3, respectively. According to the final calculation (Fig. 3b), with the same amount of Bi, the volume of Bi2O3 can shrink 19.2%, while, the value is 57.6% for BiOCl. In other words, the space that BiOCl has left after topotactic transformation is much larger than that for Bi2O3. Therefore, there is enough room for T-BiNS transformation into Bi2O3 in the oxidation process after the first topotactic transformation of BiOCl. Fig. 3c illustrates our proposal of the stable huge space among the self-supported ultrathin Bi nanosheets produced by topotactic transformation. On the one hand, the huge space and the ultrathin T-BiNS are beneficial for the infiltration of the electrolyte and further promote rapid charge transport, efficient ion diffusion and creation of abundant electroactive sites. Therefore, T-BiNS can have high capacity and superior rate performance. On the other hand, the T-BiNS were self-reinforced, resulting from the strong connection of the nanosheets with each other. Additionally, the huge space provides ample room for the expansion of T-BiNS due to the reversible reaction of Bi ↔ Bi2O3. Profiting from the above two main factors, T-BiNS is very stable during the charge/discharge process and can endure thousands of cycles.

(b) Normalized volume and space left (corresponding to Bi) after Bi2O3 and BiOCl reduced to Bi. (c) Illustration of our proposed mechanism to explain why T-BiNS is superior. (d) In situ Raman spectra of Bi, Bi2O3 and BiOCl at different states of reduction (R) and oxidation (O) with various cycles. 
The proposed explanation can be verified by using in situ Raman spectra and ex situ SEM images as shown in Fig. 3d and 4 respectively. Firstly, Bi, Bi2O3 and BiOCl at different states of reduction (R) and oxidation (O) with various cycles were investigated by using in situ Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 3d). Before this, peak assignment was clarified as shown in Fig. S5 and Table S1 in the ESI.† The Raman bands at 70 and 96 cm−1 are attributed to the Eg and A1g modes of the rhombohedral Bi structure, respectively,36 while the peaks located at 84, 126 and 312 cm−1 are assigned to Bi2O3.37,38 Finally, the distinct peaks of 148 cm−1 and 199 cm−1 belong to the A1g internal Bi–Cl and Eg internal Bi–Cl stretching modes of BiOCl.39 A Raman shift in the range of 50–210 cm−1 is observed as shown in Fig. 1d, which reflects the chemical component changes of Bi, Bi2O3 and BiOCl during the cycles. For Bi nanosheets, the intensity of the characteristic Raman peaks at 70 and 96 cm−1 decreased gradually when the oxidation process was performed 2 and 4 times (Bi-O2 and O4), while the peaks for Bi2O3 (84 and 126 cm−1) became stronger accordingly, which verifies that Bi changed to Bi2O3 in the oxidation process. However, the peaks belonging to Bi did not disappear eventually even after 4 oxidation steps, which means that the conversion of Bi to Bi2O3 is incomplete and thereafter indicates its poor capacity and rate performance. The situation was similar for Bi2O3 nanosheets. When the Raman shifts were collected in the 2nd and 4th reduction steps (Bi2O3-R2 and R4), the peaks of Bi became strong step by step and those for Bi2O3 weakened correspondingly but not disappeared at all. In the opposite process (Bi2O3-O2 and O4), the peaks of Bi2O3 appeared again but those for Bi did not vanish completely. This also indicates that the reaction of Bi ↔ Bi2O3 for traditional Bi2O3 nanosheets was not complete even when they underwent multiple charge or discharge processes. Notably, the case was quite different for BiOCl, which transformed into Bi eventually just in the first reduction step (BiOCl-R1) in that all the peaks of BiOCl vanished and those of Bi appeared. When it was oxidized only once, almost all Bi transformed into Bi2O3 (T-BiNS-O1). Compared with traditionally used Bi or Bi2O3 nanosheets, the Raman results of BiOCl reveal that the topotactic transformation is complete and the charge/discharge reaction of T-BiNS is highly reversible. Thus, there is no doubt that the special structure of T-BiNS is beneficial to acquire high capacity and high rate performance.
 Fig. 4  SEM images of Bi (a–c), Bi2O3 (d–f) and T-BiNS (g–i) for the 1st reduction, oxidation and after 500 cycles at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. 
XPS measurement was performed to further confirm the reaction mechanism and the reversibility as shown in Fig. S6 in the ESI.† It is found that Bi3+ located at the binding energy of 164.4 and 159.1 eV in BiOCl is reduced to Bi0 (162.2 and 156.9 eV respectively) in the reduction process and the signal of the element Cl disappears completely,40,41 reflecting that BiOCl is completely converted to Bi. It should be noticed that there is still part of Bi3+, probably resulting from the surface oxidation of Bi. After the oxidation process, Bi0 vanishes completely and converts to Bi3+, and moreover the element Cl still has no signal, which exactly proves that Bi is oxidized to Bi2O3 and the reduction process of BiOCl is not reversible. In summary, the XPS results also confirm the mechanism of eqn (1) and (2), further reflecting that topotactic transformation is complete and the charge/discharge reaction of T-BiNS is highly reversible.
The SEM images of Bi, Bi2O3 and T-BiNS after the 1st reduction, 1st oxidation and 500 cycles showed visual morphology changes. Compared to the initial Bi branched nanosheets (Fig. S1b†), the morphology of the sample has no change after reduction (Fig. 4a) in that Bi already exists in the lowest valence state. However, only after the 1st oxidation, the nanosheets are pulverized into nanoparticles because of the expansion of Bi to Bi2O3 (Fig. 4b). Finally, the nanostructured morphology totally disappears after the repeated charge/discharge cycles as shown in Fig. 4c. The agglomeration of the particles hampered the infiltration of the electrolyte and decreased the capacity and rate performance. Likewise, the case for Bi2O3 nanosheets is also terrible since their volume shrinks and expands by the same value in theory during the reaction of Bi ↔ Bi2O3. Thus, there is no extra space to relieve the expansion and aggregation, finally resulting in a low capacity and poor cycling stability. The conjecture is verified as shown in Fig. 4d–f. The Bi2O3 nanosheets are pulverized just after the 1st reduction, and when the oxidation process is performed, the particles become larger than before owing to the expansion of the bismuth particles. After 500 cycles, the particles are also agglomerated seriously. As illustrated before, the special self-supported ultrathin Bi nanosheets are acquired after topotactic transformation as shown in Fig. 4g. It is worth noting that the ultrathin nanosheets become much thicker after the 1st oxidation in that they nearly transform into Bi2O3 completely at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 (Fig. 4h). In spite of this, the space among the Bi2O3 nanosheets is still visible and the nanosheets are supported with each other tightly. As calculated before, the volume that BiOCl left is 57.6%, which is more than that needed for the volume expansion of 19.2% (Bi → Bi2O3) in theory. Therefore, the abundant space and the unique self-supported structure prevent T-BiNS from aggregation. As shown in Fig. 4i, the structure constituted by self-supported nanosheets almost has no change after 500 cycles. It still retains a porous structure even after 5000 cycles as shown in Fig. S7 in the ESI,† which is beneficial for the infiltration of the electrolyte and maintaining high capacity even after thousands of cycles.
The nitrogen adsorption–desorption technique was used to characterize the specific surface area and pore size distribution of the BiOCl, T-BiNS, Bi and Bi2O3 nanosheets as shown in Fig. S8 in the ESI.† All of the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm curves reveal a type IV isotherm. BJH pore size distribution indicates that the pore structure is mainly composed of mesopores. The specific surface area of BiOCl is only 5.54 m2 g−1, which is lower than that of Bi nanosheets (11.16 m2 g−1) and Bi2O3 nanosheets (14.63 m2 g−1). However, the specific surface area of T-BiNS increases to 45.63 m2 g−1 after reduction, which is nearly ten times that of the initial BiOCl. The large specific area is originated from the topotactic transformation, which can be beneficial for the infiltration of the electrolyte and rapid ion transportation.
3.4 Investigation of the NiCo2O4//T-BiNS full battery
NiCo2O4 has been proven as a good cathode material before.14,17,22 XRD patterns in Fig. S9a in the ESI† matched well with those of NiCo2O4 and a nanorod structure was observed as shown in Fig. S9b.† The CV and galvanostatic discharge curves in Fig. S9c and d† verify its ability working as a cathode electrode respectively. Then, a full NiCo2O4//T-BiNS battery was fabricated to further demonstrate the potential of the T-BiNS electrode for energy storage application. Fig. 5a displays the CV curves of the assembled NiCo2O4//T-BiNS full cell at various scan rates. Well-defined redox couples are observed even at a scan rate of 200 mV s−1, demonstrating the superfast charge/discharge performance of this NiCo2O4//T-BiNS battery. The typical galvanostatic discharge curves at different current densities ranging from 1 to 20 A g−1 are shown in Fig. 5b. A remarkable capacity of 144 mA h g−1 is achieved at a current density of 1 A g−1 and a capacity of 78 mA h g−1 is still retained at 20 A g−1. Poor cycling performance is well known to be one of the major bottlenecks for ARBs. The long-term stability of the prepared NiCo2O4//T-BiNS battery was examined at a current density of 5 A g−1 and the capacity retention was 88.6% after 2500 cycles (Fig. 5c). Moreover, the coulombic efficiency of the NiCo2O4//T-BiNS battery is stable and close to 100% during the cycling, revealing the good reversibility of this battery. The rate performance was investigated to show its stability at different current densities (Fig. S10 in the ESI†). The full cell exhibits superior stability from a current density of 0.5 A g−1 to 10 A g−1. The capacity nearly has no change when it is back to 0.5 A g−1 again. The good stability surpasses that of many types of ARBs including Ni//Bi,14,23 Ni//Fe,20 NiCo//Zn,17 Zn//Mn7 and Al ion batteries.15 Finally, Ragone plots of our NiCo2O4//T-BiNS battery were compared with those of other previously reported ARBs (Fig. 5d). In this work, a maximum power density of 116 W h kg−1 at a power density of 780 W kg−1 is delivered based on the total mass of the active materials, which markedly outperforms all the ARBs using Bi or Bi2O3 as an anode material and also surpasses those of other ARBs such as Ni//Fe and Al//graphite batteries.6,14,15,20,22,23,42,43 The energy density is still retained at 61.6 W h kg−1 at a high power density of 11.2 kW kg−1, confirming its ultrafast charge/discharge performance.

4. Conclusions
In summary, self-supported ultrathin bismuth nanosheets have been acquired by a very simple strategy of in situ topotactic transformation. The bismuth nanosheets from topotactic transformation (T-BiNS) show a high capacity of 366 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 and superior stability with a retention of 82% after 5000 cycles. According to theoretical calculation, the space of T-BiNS left after the release of O and Cl atoms through topotactic transformation is 57.6%, which is much larger than that left by Bi2O3 (19.2%). The huge space and the unique self-supported bismuth ultrathin nanosheet structure enhance rapid electron transfer, decrease the activation energy of charge/discharge and improve the stability. In situ Raman spectra and ex situ SEM images as evidence support the proposed mechanisms. Finally, a NiCo2O4//T-BiNS full battery is fabricated, which presents superior energy density and stability. This work provides a special way to design active electrode materials with high energy and long lifespan, which may be used commercially in the future owing to its simplicity and efficiency.
