    , Accepted 5th November 2021First published on 11th November 2021AbstractA new phenanthroimidazole derivative (PMItz) bearing a 1,3,4-thiadiazole moiety was prepared and deposited as a thin film on a previously prepared glass/ITO substrate via the physical vapor deposition (PVD) method. The optical and surface morphological properties of the fabricated thin film, glass/ITO/PMItz, were investigated via UV-Vis spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Subsequently, metal/ITO/PMItz/metal (metal: In and Ag) devices were fabricated and their electrical properties were investigated. The optical measurements revealed the reasonably high optical conductivities of the thin films. The energy band gap was calculated to be 2.96 eV, the absorption coefficient was calculated to be 1.3 × 106 m−1 and the optical conductivity was calculated to be 3.14 × 1014. The typical diode characteristics of the devices were demonstrated by electrical measurements. The current–voltage (I–V) measurements revealed that the devices exhibited photo-sensitivity, the photovoltaic effect and strong negative differential resistance (NDR) effect at certain voltage values. The ideality factors in the dark were calculated to be 2.4 and 2.54 for the In/ITO/PMItz/In and Ag/ITO/PMItz/Ag devices, respectively. According to the Hall effect measurements, the conductivity of PMItz was found to be p-type with high carrier mobility and concentration and low specific resistance.
1. Introduction
Studies concerning the design and applications of organic heterojunction semiconductors (OSCs) is attracting increasing attention from researchers owing to their miscellaneous applications in the fabrication of modern optoelectronic devices such as organic light emitting diodes (OLED), organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), organic photovoltaics (OPV), organic photodetectors (OPDs), and organic solar cells (OSC). Although inorganic semiconductors have dark/illuminated conductivity, high carrier mobility and long life span, they are difficult to commercialize on the industrial scale owing to their limited variety, relatively high production costs and rigid film structure. However, organic semiconductors are easily accessible with wide diversity, solution processable, possess mechanical flexibility, have low production cost and their electronic properties are tunable via molecular modification.1–5 Phenanthroimidazoles are widely acknowledged as a class of molecules exhibiting outstanding photophysical-optoelectronic properties, and thus have been exploited for the fabrication of modern organic optoelectronics6–12 and their electrical performances can be tuned rationally via molecular modification.13–16 In this context, the optimization of parameters such as charge carrier mobility, band gap, power conversion efficiency (PCE), and threshold voltage is mandatory for the optoelectronic performance.2,17,18 Conversely, the negative differential resistance (NDR), as an intriguing phenomenon, which is accompanied by a decrease in electrical current with an increase in bias voltage, is pivotal and utilized for the design of diverse advanced devices such as oscillators working in the terahertz frequency domain, resonant tunnelling diodes, static random access memories, semiconductor quantum wells, and logic circuit devices.19–22 Therefore, research based on the design of devices displaying the NDR effect has recently gained momentum.19–21 In our study, as part of our ongoing research, for the first time, we synthesized the 5-(4-(1H-phenanthro[9,10-d]imidazol-2-yl)phenyl)-N-phenethyl-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-amine (PMItz) compound in which the strong electron-withdrawing thiadiazole group was secondarily substituted to widen the band gap and modulate the electrical performance of the phenanthroimidazole scaffold, and a peripheral ethylbenzene group was attached to ensure the good solubility of the compound. Subsequently, a new heterojunction thin film with PMItz as the organic layer was deposited on a pre-prepared glass/ITO bottom layer via the PVD method. Accordingly, our aim in this study was to introduce a new alternative semiconductor device to contribute to the development of the aforementioned modern optoelectronic applications. The surface morphology and optical and I–V characteristics of the film were investigated and it was demonstrated that the film exhibited significant rectifying and NDR properties under illumination and low bias conditions, while acted as a photodiode under reverse bias conditions. Also, the induction of the NDR effect under illumination demonstrated that it can be potential candidate for application in devices especially optoelectronic information function devices.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis
2-Phenethyl-3-thiosemicarbazide was synthesized as described in the literature.23 A general scheme of the synthesis is shown in Scheme 1.
 Scheme 1  Two-step route for the synthesis of PMItz.

9,10-Phenanthrenequinone (1 g, 4.80 mmol) and 4-carboxybenzaldehyde (0.72 g, 4.80 mmol) were refluxed with ammonium acetate (7.4 g, 96 mmol) in glacial acetic acid (60 mL) for 4 h. The reaction mixture was left to cool to room temperature (25 °C), and then poured into ice water. The obtained solid product was filtered, washed with water, and then dried in air.

The resulting mixture was cooled to room temperature, and then precipitated with ice water. The mixture was neutralized (pH = 7–8) with 20% ammonia solution.

2.2 Deposition of thin films
A glass/ITO substrate with dimensions of 1 × 2 cm and resistance of about 10 Ω sq−1 was successively immersed and left in deionized water, acetone and propanol in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min. The cleaned electrode was dried with nitrogen gas. van der Waals epitaxial growth of PMItz powder on the glass/ITO was carried out via thermal evaporation using a molybdenum pot, which was pre-cleaned with propanol. The deposition was performed at a chamber temperature of 26 °C and 10−6 torr pressure.
3. Materials, measurements and computations
All chemicals used in the synthesis were analytical reagent-grade (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany and Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Thin-layer chromatography was used to determine the progress of the reaction and the degree of purity of the product obtained. The melting point of the compound was determined using a Stuart SMP30 instrument. NMR analyses were performed on a Bruker Ultrashield 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. Elemental analysis was carried out on a EuroVector Brand EA3000-Single model. IR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Alpha instrument. Mass analyses were carried out on an LCMS-MS (Shimadzu, LCMS-8030 Plus). The absorption spectra of the compound were measured using a Shimadzu UV Pharmaspec 1700. Fluorescence emission data were obtained using a Horiba Fluoromax-4.
The thickness of the PMItz thin film on which organic PMItz and inorganic ITO layers interacted with each other through attractive van der Waals forces was measured with a profilometer and determined to be 580 nm. Surface analyses were performed using a NANOSURF C3000 atomic force microscope (AFM) at room temperature and using a Tap190-AlG cantilever in scan areas of 25 × 25, 10 × 10, 5 × 5 and 1 × 1 μm. Optical measurements were performed with a Thermo SCIENTIFIC Thermo Scientific Evolution Array model UV-VIS spectrometer.
Indium and silver metals were contacted with the fabricated glass/ITO/PMItz device to investigate some electrical properties, as introduced in Fig. 1. I–V characterization was performed using a SCIENCETECH AAA model Solar Simulator System in the dark and 190–290–420 W m−2 illuminated media.
 Fig. 1  Configurations of (a) In/ITO/PMItz/In and (b) Ag/ITO/PMItz/Ag devices. 
As shown in Fig. 1, the anodes in direct bias were connected to indium and silver on PMItz, while the cathodes were connected to them on ITO. In reverse bias, the connections were replaced. Hall effect measurements were conducted using an Ecopia HMS-5000 Hall effect measurement system at 300 K, with a current of 1 × 10−5 A, under a 0.55 T magnetic field using the four-probe method.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out using the Gaussian 09W program suit. The hybrid B3LYP functional with basis set combinations of 6-31G(d,p) for C, H, and N atoms and 6-311G(d,p) for S atoms was used for the gas-phase geometry optimization. The pure B1LYP density functional together with the cc-PVTZ basis set was used for the single-point energy calculation.24
4. Results and discussion
4.1 Photophysical properties of PMItz
The change in color of PMItz in DMSO under daylight and a UV lamp is shown in Fig. 2. The absorption and emission profiles of PMItz in DMSO solution are presented in Fig. 3. The absorption maximum of PMItz was observed at 375 nm and its emission maximum was observed at 437 nm. PMItz displayed a Stokes shift of 62 nm.
 Fig. 2  Images of PMItz under daylight (left) and a UV lamp (365 nm) (right) in DMSO. 
 Fig. 3  Absorption (red) and emission (blue) spectra of PMItz in DMSO (10−5 M). 
The quantum yield of PMItz was calculated in DMSO medium using perylene in cyclohexane solution (see S1 in the ESI† for details) and found to be 0.69. Owing to the high quantum yield and high light-sensitivity of the compound, it was fabricated as a device by growing it on a conductive surface (ITO) and its electrical and detailed optical properties were investigated.
4.2 DFT studies
The frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs), HOMO and LUMO isosurfaces of PMItz extracted from SPE calculation at the optimized structure are depicted in Fig. 4. Its HOMO is significantly localized over the phenanthroimidazole terminal, while its LUMO mostly resides on the phenyl and thiadiazole moieties. This change in molecular orbital distribution clearly indicates the contribution of the thiadiazole group to electronic excitation by conjugative delocalization through a strong inductive electron-withdrawing effect.
 Fig. 4  HOMO (bottom) and LUMO (top) isosurfaces of PMItz with an isodensity of 0.002 Å−3. 
The isosurfaces of the natural transition orbitals (NTOs) depicted in Fig. 5 exhibit almost the same distribution as the frontier molecular orbitals and seem identical. The reason for this similarity between the FMOs and NTOs originates from the single localized character of the electronic transition between the HOMO and LUMO given that the transition amplitude is almost unity (λ = 0.99).

4.3 Analyses of surface morphological properties of glass/ITO/PMItz thin film by AFM and SEM
Surface analyses of the glass/ITO/PMItz heterojunction were performed in scan areas of 25 × 25, 10 × 10, 5 × 5 and 1 × 1 μm. The 2D and 3D surface images are presented in Fig. 6 and 7. It is obvious that the growth of the film was reasonably homogenous on the glass/ITO substrate. In the 25 × 25, 10 × 10, and 5 × 5 scan areas, it can be seen that the film grew in the form of close hills, while in the 1 × 1 μm scan area, the film appears in the form of parallel valleys on the nm-scale. The average roughness (Sa) and root mean square roughness (Sq) values for the 25 × 25, 10 × 10, 5 × 5 and 1 × 1 μm scan areas were determined to be 4.9–7.7 nm, 3.5–5.0 nm, 3.0–3.7 nm, and 2.6–3.2 nm, respectively. According to these values, it is understood that the film surface is quite smooth.

The SEM images of the glass/ITO/PMItz thin film are presented in Fig. 8. As can be seen in Fig. 8, PMItz was grown in the form of nanowires with a change in size from ≈5.4 μm to ≈0.27 μm and exhibited a uniform and smooth distribution. The layers are distinguishable to some extent in the cross-sectional image of the heterojunction shown in Fig. 8. The film thickness of PMItz was estimated to be 612 nm, which is consistent with the thickness measured with the profilometer.

4.4 Optical properties of glass/ITO/PMItz thin film
The optical properties of thin films are pivotal in opto-electronic applications. Therefore, the optical characteristics of the newly fabricated glass/ITO/PMItz heterojunction were investigated to determine its absorption coefficient (α), energy band gap (Eg), optical transmittance (%T), optical reflectance (%R), refractive index (n), extinction coefficient (k), optical conductivity (σ) and dielectric parameters such as real (εr) and imaginary (εi) dielectric constants (ε) and dielectric loss (εi/εr).

Fig. 9a, c and d show the plots of α, %T, and %R versus λ and Fig. 9b shows the plot of (αhν)2versus hν.
 Fig. 9  (a) Plot of absorption coefficient, (b) energy band gap, (c) transmittance (%) and (d) reflectance (%). 
Specifically, α was calculated using the formula, (1)where d is the thickness of the film and A is the absorbance. The energy band gap was assigned using the optical absorption spectroscopy technique. The relation between the absorption coefficient and energy band gap (Eg) is given by25 (2)where hν is the energy of a photon and n is equal to 1/2 for direct allowed transitions. Using this technique, the plot of versus hν can be obtained and Eg is determined by extrapolating the straight line portion of the plot to the energy axis, where the intercept gives the value of Eg.
The relation between absorbance (A) and transmittance (T) is given by: A = −logT(3)and the reflection (R) is given by: R = 1 − (A + T)(4)Then the refractive index (n) is given as26,27 (5)The relation between the absorption coefficient (α) and extinction coefficient (k) is calculated as follows: (6)As seen in Fig. 9a, no significant absorption was observed from 1100 nm to 443 nm, while an intense maximum peak appeared at 364 nm in the UV region with a value of 1.3 × 106 m−1. As shown in Fig. 9b, the energy band gap value was calculated to be 2.96 eV. It is clear from Fig. 9c that the thin film was substantially transparent in the visible and near IR regions, while from 445 nm to 300 nm, a strong decrease was observed. In association with its transmittance spectrum, almost no reflectance was observed from 1100 nm to 445 nm, while below 445 nm, it dramatically increased. In the formulation, the term R + T ≈1 denotes the absence of a substantial absorbance, whereas a reasonable absorption takes place in the range of R + T ≪ 1. This phenomenon is clearly evident in Fig. 9.
The n and k values are the main optical parameters frequently used in opto-electronic characterization in particular fields. Fig. 10a and b show the spectra of n and k versus λ. From 1100 nm to around 450 nm, the n and k values are almost constant, while after 450 nm, they sharply increased. In the wavelength range of 1100–450 nm, the n value was nearly 1.01 and the k value was 0.01. The refractive index profile gives two maxima in near the UV region with a value of 1.22, while the extinction coefficient profile gives one maximum with a value of 0.39.
 Fig. 10  (a) Refractive index and (b) extinction coefficient. 
The electronic excitation profiles of the thin films are directly dependent on the parameter ε (including real and imaginary parts), which is also associated with the n and k parameters.
The real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant, dielectric loss and optical conductivity are given as εr = n2 − k2, εi = 2nk, εi/εr and σ = αnc/4π, respectively.

Fig. 11a–d show the plots of σ, εr, εi and εi/εrversus hν, respectively.
 Fig. 11  (a) Optical conductivity, (b) real dielectric constant, (c) imaginary dielectric constant and (d) dielectric loss. 
As seen Fig. 10, all the parameters sharply increased above 2.75 eV. The highest values of σ, εr, εi and εi/εr were observed at 3.14 × 1014, 1.46, 0.79 and 0.73, respectively.
4.5 Electrical properties of In/ITO/PMItz/In and Ag/ITO/PMItz/Ag devices
The I–V characterization of the In/ITO/PMItz/In and Ag/ITO/PMItz/Ag devices, which were configured as shown in Fig. 1, was investigated in the voltage range of ±20 V, under dark and 190, 290, and 420 w/m2 light intensities. The I–V and Rj–V plots of each device under reverse and forward bias conditions are depicted in Fig. 12a–c and 13a–c, respectively.

 Fig. 13  (a) I–V, (b) reverse bias Rj–V and (c) forward bias Rj–V characteristics of Ag/ITO/PMItz/Ag device. 
The Rs (series) and Rsh (Shunt) resistances are pivotal parameters that substantially affect the performance and reliability of any diode.
Thus, the Rs and Rsh values of the In/ITO/PMItz/In and Ag/ITO/PMItz/Ag diodes were obtained from the graphs in Fig. 12b, c and 13b, c, respectively, which were plotted as bias voltage vs. junction resistance . Generally, a low Rs value denotes a higher current flow through the junction, while an RSH value near infinity shows a small leakage current through the junction. At a sufficient forward bias, the Rj value in the bottom region of the Rj–V plot gives Rs, while at a sufficient reverse bias, the maximum peak resistance is estimated to be Rsh.28 The Rs effect occurs under the interface conditions between ITO and PMItz, while Rsh is associated with the conditions between the contacts (In and Ag) and thin films.29Tables 1 and 2 list the Rs and Rsh values for the In/ITO/PMItz/In and Ag/ITO/PMItz/Ag devices, respectively, which were calculated from the Rj–V plot, and the n and Rs values were also calculated using the Cheung function given in eqn (7).

In both devices, it was observed that the Rs values from the Rj–V plot decreased with an increase in light intensity. This decrement can be associated with the increment in carrier concentration induced by the light intensity. In contrast, no coherent change in Rsh values from the Rj–V plot with light intensity was observed. This discrepancy can arise from the NDR effect. In the In/ITO/PMItz/In heterostructure, the highest Rsh value was observed at 190 W m−2, while in the Ag/ITO/PMItz/Ag heterostructure, it was observed at 420 W m−2. The low Rs value and the high Rsh value is the ideal condition for diodes.30
The values of n and Rs were calculated from the I–V characterization performed at room temperature (300 K) in a dark environment. The current–voltage expression of a non-ideal heterojunction diode including the series resistance effect is expressed as follows:30 (7)where A is the contact area, A* is the Richardson constant, ϕbp is the barrier height, k is the Boltzmann constant, n is the ideality factor, Rs is the series resistance and q is the electronic charge. By adding the IRs expression to eqn (6), the voltage falling on the series resistor can expressed. In eqn (6), the stress expression is inside the exponential function and the logarithm is taken on both sides of the equation to exclude this exponential function, as follows: (8)and when this equation is solved for voltage, the following equation is obtained, (9)If the derivative of both sides is taken according to lnI to eliminate the term ϕbp in the equation, (10)is obtained. In this equation, it can be seen that dV/d(lnI) is linear with respect to I. In this correlation, the slope of eqn (10) will give the series resistance Rs. Besides, Fig. 14 shows the d(V)/d(ln(I)) vs. I plots of the In/ITO/PMItz/In (left) and Ag/ITO/PMItz/Ag (right) devices. The ideality factor, n, was calculated from the y-intercept of these plots.
 Fig. 14  d(V)/d(ln(I)) vs. I plots of In/ITO/PMItz/In (left) and Ag/ITO/PMItz/Ag (right). 
It can be seen that the Rs values calculated from the Cheung function are in agreement with that calculated from the Rj–V graph. The In/ITO/PMItz/In device has a lower diode ideality factor than the Ag/ITO/PMItz/Ag device. This can be attributed to its low value of Rs.
In both heterostructures, the NDR effect was obviously observed. In the In/ITO/PMItz/In and Ag/ITO/PMItz/Ag heterostructures, the NDR effect is very high at some voltage values, while it is very low at others. The effect of light enhances the NDR effect at low voltage values, while it reduces it at high voltage values. The band overlaps occurring between the junctions decreased or partly disappeared depending on the external electrical field arising from the applied potential. Namely, the number of electrons quantum mechanically contributing to the current decreased. In relation to this observation, X. Wang et al. associated the enhancement of the NDR effect under light with strong photo-resistance,31 while K. W. Lee et al. associated the decrement in the NDR effect with a decrement in the overlap of wavefunctions at valley voltage values in the contact region.32
As seen in the forward bias Rj–V curves in Fig. 12c and 13c, the Rj values fluctuated. The peak values of Rj are presented in Tables 1 and 2 for the In/ITO/PMItz/In and Ag/ITO/PMItz/Ag devices, respectively. The fluctuation and maximized Rj values at some voltage values originate from the NDR effect. In the In/ITO/PMItz/In heterojunction, the Rj maximum peaks were observed at around 0.3–0.4, 15.0–16.5, 19.5–20 V both in the dark and in illuminated media. Similar to that in In/ITO/PMItz/In, the maximum peaks were observed at around 0.3–0.6, 3.1–3.7, 10.5–11.5, 15.0–16.0, and 19.0–20.0 V in the Ag/ITO/PMItz/Ag heterojunction. Namely, both heterojunctions produce similar maximum peaks at close voltage values, at which both devices work efficiently in terms of NDR. The Rj values for the devices at some important forward bias voltage values in the dark and in illuminated media are listed in Tables 3 and 4, respectively.

Table 5 presents the Hall effect analysis data for PMItz. The positive sign of the average Hall coefficient denotes that the conductivity originates from holes, and hence PMItz is a p-type conductor. The determined mobility is considerably high compared to conventional semiconductors.33–36 Besides, the carrier concentration is extremely high and the specific resistance is low, which is significant in terms of conductivity.

5. Concluding remarks
A new phenanthroimidazole derivative, PMItz, which was prepared using 9,10-phenanthrenequinone, 4-carboxybenzaldehyde and 2-phenylethyl thiosemicarbazide precursors, showed high light sensitivity and quantum yield in solution. Then based on these properties, the compound was grown as a thin film on a conducting substrate, and AFM images indicated that the fine structure of thin film is very smooth. The energy band gap of the film, which was quite transparent in the near IR and visible region, was calculated to be 2.96 eV and its absorption coefficient was found to be 1.3 × 106 m−1. Sharp peaks at around 400 nm for the n and k values were also observed. Besides, the optical conductivity value in the high absorption region was estimated to be around 1014, which is a reasonably high value. The Hall effect analysis demonstrated that PMItz is a p-type conductor with high carrier mobility and concentration, which is pivotal in terms of high conductivity. The electrical analysis data revealed that the devices exhibited typical diode behaviour and the ideality factors estimated in the dark were 2.4 and 2.54 for the In/ITO/PMItz/In and Ag/ITO/PMItz/Ag devices, respectively. It was observed from the I–V characterization at various light intensities that the devices were photo-sensitive, showing a photovoltaic effect and having a strong NDR effect at some voltage values. Therefore, they are potential candidates for advanced optoelectronic applications such as tunnel diodes, high frequency oscillators, static random access memories, and switching gates. Alternatively, the optoelectronic performance of the fabricated devices can be enhanced by using different contact materials (Au, Al, etc.), changing the film thickness and constructing new heterojunctions using well-known semiconductors such as GaAs, CIGS, and CIS.
