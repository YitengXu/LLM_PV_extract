    , Accepted 25th March 2019First published on 25th March 2019AbstractNon-fullerene organic solar cells (NFOSCs) have attracted much attention in recent years since non-fullerene conjugated materials show many advantages, such as structural versatility, tunable absorption, energy levels and crystallinity compared to fullerene derivatives with limited material selection. Therefore, NFOSCs have achieved high power conversion efficiencies over 15%. Innovation of conjugated materials is the key factor to improve the photovoltaic performance. The diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) unit has been widely incorporated into conjugated materials with near-infrared (NIR) absorption spectra due to its strong electron-withdrawing ability. DPP-based conjugated materials also show strong crystallinity and high hole/electron mobilities, indicating that they can be used as both electron donors and electron acceptors in organic solar cells. In this review, we have focused on DPP-based conjugated materials for application in NFOSCs, including (i) DPP-based polymer donors, (ii) DPP-based small molecule donors, (iii) DPP-based polymer acceptors and (iv) DPP-based small molecule acceptors. We will highlight the structural design in these materials, and the selection of donors/acceptors to match with DPP-based conjugated materials. In the last part, we will provide perspectives about the design of DPP-based materials for application in NFOSCs in the future.Chaowei ZhaoChaowei Zhao received his B.S. degree in 2010 from Shandong Normal University and Ph.D. degree there in 2016 under the supervision of Prof. Yu-Bin Dong.

1. Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) containing electron donors and electron acceptors in the photo-active layers have attracted much attention in the past two decades due to the advantages of flexibility, easy printing fabrication, light weight and low cost.1–7 Initially, fullerene derivatives were widely used as electron acceptors, affording power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 11%.8–10 The uniqueness of fullerene derivatives is their ball-like conjugated skeleton to enhance the donor/acceptor (D/A) interface, accept several electrons, and provide continuous and isotropic electron transport. All these merits make fullerene derivatives universal electron acceptors to match with electron donors with distinct structures. However, fullerene derivatives also have obvious drawbacks, including difficulty in structural modification, narrow absorption bands and poor photo-stability, thus hampering the development of OSCs.11 Alternatively, non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) with excellent synthetic flexibility have been a hot topic in the OSC community in recent years.12–21 In conjunction with their tunable optical, electronic, crystalline and charge transport properties, NFAs have been widely applied in OSCs with breakthrough PCEs in single-junction cells exceeding 15%.22
Nowadays, the most widely used strategy to design conjugated materials for OSCs is constructing the so-called donor–acceptor structure, that is, electron-rich and electron-deficient units are covalently linked into one material.2 Electron-deficient units, such as benzothiadiazole,23 thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione,24 isoindigo,25 diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP),26 naphthalene diimide27 and perylene diimide,28 have been widely applied in conjugated materials. Among them, the DPP unit has attracted much attention due to its strong electron-withdrawing ability, good crystallinity and high charge carrier mobility in conjugated materials. DPP was first synthesized in the 1970s as the by-product of the classical Reformatsky reaction between benzonitrile and ethylbromoacetate.29 With two π-conjugated bicyclic dilactam moieties (Fig. 1, inset), DPP compounds usually show strong absorption in the visible region. The 2,5-position, i.e. the lactam N-atoms, can be easily used to attach solubilizing alkyl chains to obtain solution processable materials. Meanwhile, the 3,6-position of the DPP moiety can be easily attached with different aromatic groups due to the synthetic nature of DPP. With the advantages including simple synthesis, intense color, excellent stability and low solubility, DPP-compounds have been widely applied as classical organic pigments. The synthesis, derivatization and dye-based application have been reviewed in several articles.30–32

Another appealing property of DPP-based conjugated materials is their high charge carrier mobilities that lead to wide applications in organic field-effect transistors and photovoltaics.26,33–40 Since the first application in OSCs in 2008, DPP-based conjugated materials have been widely applied in the organic photovoltaic field.41 Research in the early stage mainly focused on DPP-based donor materials blended with fullerene-based acceptors to form BHJ active layers.26,33,34 Many DPP-based small molecules and conjugated polymers were developed, with absorption extended to 1000 nm or above42 and hole mobilities >1 cm2 V−1 s−1,43 so that OSCs based on DPP-conjugated materials showed promising PCEs close to 9% with a broad photoresponse.44 More importantly, several studies revealed that DPP-polymers tend to show fibrillar structures in pure and BHJ thin films,45,46 enabling efficient exciton diffusion and charge separation. This unique property helps the photo-active layers containing DPP-based conjugated materials to show thick thin films and meanwhile keep promising PCEs, and thus they have potential application in large-area devices.47
Therefore, looking at the literature, the study of DPP-based conjugated materials for OSCs showed an increasing trend during 2008–2016 (Fig. 1). However, it started to drop in 2017 and 2018. Meanwhile, it is clear that non-fullerene OSCs (NFOSCs) have attracted much attention in recent years with a significantly increased number of publications (Fig. 1). Many non-fullerene materials, especially fused-ring electron acceptors that were developed by Zhan et al.,16 show similar broad absorption in the NIR region and good charge transport properties with DPP-based conjugated materials, so it seems that DPP-based materials can be replaced by these non-fullerene materials.48,49 With these trends, the question is, are DPP-based conjugated materials still suitable for OSCs and what are their advantages?
In this review, we provide an overview about DPP-conjugated materials for application in NFOSCs. DPP-based materials for fullerene-based OSCs have been comprehensively reviewed in several studies.26,33–35 Herein, we mainly focus on NFOSCs based on DPP-materials, including: (i) DPP-based polymer donors with NFAs, (ii) DPP-based small molecule donors with NFAs, (iii) DPP-based polymer acceptors and (iv) DPP-based small molecule acceptors. We will provide deep insight into these applications and finally will provide an outlook about the innovations of DPP-based organic photovoltaics in the future.
2. DPP-based polymer donors with non-fullerene acceptors
As mentioned above, the application of DPPs in OSCs started from DPP-based polymer donors with fullerene derivatives as electron acceptors. As the development of NFAs has become a hot topic in the past few years, NFOSCs based on DPP polymer donors and NFA blended layers were also explored. To date, two most promising families of NFAs are those based on fused aromatic cores with strong electron-accepting end groups and rylene diimide-based materials. Therefore, NFAs used in DPP-polymer solar cells are mainly from the two categories, such as ITIC,19 SdiPBI58 and N2200 (ref. 27) (Table 1). An exception is DPP-based polymer acceptors for all DPP-based polymer solar cells that will be discussed in the following section.54–56

Jiang et al. reported four conjugated polymers PD-1, PD-2, PD-3, and PD-4 with a DPP core alternated with an oligothiophene segment (Fig. 2) as the donor and the well-known fused ring acceptor ITIC.50 These DPP-polymers showed absorption spectra in the range of 600–900 nm. Although the Frontier energy levels, including the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels, don't match well with those of ITIC, the inverted device based on PD-3:ITIC gave a PCE of 4.1% under simulated solar radiation. The superior device performance of PD-3 to those of PD-1 (1.9%), PD-2 (3.9%), and PD-4 (3.8%) was mainly attributed to the relatively higher LUMO and HOMO offsets of 0.22 and 0.36 eV between the donor and acceptor, respectively. Morphology characterization showed obvious worm-like structures or crystallized domains in these thin films, indicating large phase separation with poor miscibility between DPP polymers and ITIC. This might explain the low short-circuit current density (Jscs) and fill factors (FF) in solar cells due to the less efficient exciton dissociation and charge separation.
 Fig. 2  DPP-based polymers as donors for non-fullerene solar cells. 
Complementary absorption spectra of donor and acceptor materials is usually expected for full sun-spectrum coverage in the active layer. Compared to ITIC, the rylene diimide-based small molecule acceptor SdiPBI showed a supplementary absorption band in the range of 400–600 nm with DPP-based conjugated polymers. However, most SdiPBI based OSCs blended with DPP polymer donors gave obviously lower performance than those based on ITIC. For example, Ye et al. reported a PD-1:SdiPBI device which just gave a PCE of 0.98% (Fig. 1 and Table 1).51 Later, Li and co-workers explored the blends of SdiPBI with PD-2, PD-3, PD-5 and PD-6 (Fig. 2).52 The dithienopyrrole unit in PD-6 narrows the optical band gap to 1.23 eV. While obtaining moderate PCEs between 2.1% and 2.6% for PD-2, PD-3 and PD-5, the PD-6 based cell gave the lowest PCE of 1.6% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.50 V, which can be attributed to the high-lying HOMO level of PD-6. Poor phase separation can be observed in these blended films. Differently, the thienyl-substituted anthracene conjugated DPP polymer PD-7 (Fig. 2) designed by Jung and Jo displayed an improved PCE of 4.23% (Table 1), which was comparable to those of DPP-polymer:ITIC solar cells.57 The HOMO and LUMO offsets between PD-7 and SdiPBI were 0.6 eV and 0.4 eV respectively. Moreover, morphology investigation by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed an interconnected BHJ framework with fibrillar nanostructures, which might help in exciton dissociation and reducing charge recombination. Therefore, the optimized PD-7:SdiPBI cell gave a Jsc of 9.8 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.77 V and FF of 0.56. The PCE of 4.23% is currently the highest value for DPP-polymer:NFA systems.
Another famous rylene diimide polymer acceptor N2200 displays a slightly higher LUMO level than that of [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM), so improved Vocs can be usually expected for N2200 based OSCs. Li et al. investigated N2200 based NFOSCs with PD-3, PD-5, PD-6 and PD-8 as donors, providing PCEs ranging from 0.45% to 1.7%.53 Resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) on these BHJ thin films revealed a mixed morphology between the DPP-polymer and N2200. Excessive mixing leads to the suppression of polymer crystallization, high charge recombination and relatively low Jscs and PCEs.53
In this part, we provided a review about DPP-based polymer donors to combine with NFAs, such as ITIC, SdiPBI and N2200 for NFOSCs. Apparently, the performance in these cells is always low compared to the cells using fullerene derivatives as electron acceptors. Some studies show that the strong crystallinity of DPP caused severe phase separation with small acceptors, and the others indicate that the excessive mixing between the DPP-polymer donor and N2200 as the polymer acceptor is responsible for the low performance. Therefore, one question is, why the ball-like fullerene derivatives can work well with DPP-polymers, but non-fullerene acceptors do not. We think the reason is beyond our understanding and still more work needs to be done in the future. At least, although vast amounts of DPP-polymers have been explored, few of them have been applied in NFOSCs.
3. DPP-based small molecule donors with non-fullerene acceptors
Small molecule (SM) materials are generally easier to synthesize and purify than their polymeric counterparts. The well-defined molecular structures can help to correlate the structure with the photovoltaic performance.59 DPP-based small molecules can be usually obtained following the strategy for constructing DPP-based polymers. The developed DPP-based small molecules used as electron donors can be mainly classified into two classes according to the location of the DPP unit in the molecule: (i) DPP-cored small molecule donor and (ii) DPP-ended small molecule donor.
3.1 DPP-cored small molecule donors
Thiophene-DPP-thiophene (T-DPP-T) cored small molecules with benzene for SD-1-C, naphthalene for SD-2-C and pyrene for SD-3-C were reported by Yuan and Ma (Fig. 3C presents the DPP units used as the core).60 They were easily prepared via palladium catalyzed C–H activation cross-coupling between thiophene and aryl halides. The large pyrene end groups endow SD-3-C with more coplanarity and higher crystallinity than SD-1-C and SD-2-C. The optimized devices based on these small molecule donors blended with N2200 gave PCEs of 0.20%, 0.50% and 2.05% respectively. The device based on SD-3-C:N2200 exhibited a Voc of 0.78 V, Jsc of 4.5 mA cm−2, and FF of 58.5% (Table 2). The photocurrent density (Jph) of the SD-3-C:N2200 cell can reach a high plateau under low effective voltage below 0.5 V, while the Jph of SD-1-C:N2200 and SD-2-C:N2200 cells slowly increased, indicating more efficient charge carrier extraction in the SD-3-C:N2200 cell. While the electron mobilities of the three blends were around 3.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 S−1, the hole mobility of 3.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1 for SD-3-C:N2200 was much higher than those for SD-2-C:N2200 (1.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 S−1) and SD-1-C:N2200 (1.7 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 S−1). The higher hole mobility from SD-3-C contributes to the higher EQE of SD-3-C:N2200. AFM and grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) further revealed a better blend morphology of SD-3-C:N2200, which might be due to the enhanced crystallinity and intermolecular contacts of the pyrene unit.64

In addition, according to the research of Douglas et al., SD-3-C as the electron donor was used to combine with several A–D–A–D–A electron acceptors by using benzothiadiazole (BT) or isothianaphthene-nitrile (ITNCN) as the π-conjugated cores, thiophene (T) as linking units and phthalimide (PI) or thienoimide (TI) with alternating alkyl chains as end groups.61 Among them, BT(TTI-n12)2 appended with linear n-dodecyl (n12) chains presented the best performance with SD-3-C, providing a PCE of 2.40% with a Voc of 1.05 V, Jsc of 3.72 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.60 (Table 2), which was among the highest performances of solution-processed all small molecule NFOSCs at that time. Notably, all these devices gave high Vocs above 0.85 V, which can be attributed to their low electron affinities. GIWAXS measurement showed distinctive diffraction peaks in the SD-3-C:BT(TTI-n12)2 film, and AFM images exhibited fine phase separation between the donor and acceptor. These observations might explain the high FF, Jsc and PCE in solar cells.
Walker et al. reported the combination of the easily synthesized SD-4-C and two vinazene acceptors A1 and A2 (Fig. 3).62 For the as-cast film of SD-4-C:A1, the PL spectra were completely quenched, indicating the mixed phase of the donor and acceptor. After thermal annealing (TA), the PL intensity can be partially recovered, indicating better phase separation between the donor and acceptor. Although the A1-based device gave a low PCE of just ca. 0.8% after TA treatment, an exceptionally high Voc of 1.23 V was obtained. The excessive bulk 2-(2-ethylhexyl) (EH) groups in A1 were anticipated to hinder the charge transport, so EH was changed to n-hexyl in A2. The optimized A2-based device gave an improved PCE of 1.10% (Table 2).
Namepetra et al. synthesized a DPP-based small molecule SD-5-C with the PI-F-DPP-F-PI structure, where PI was phthalimide and F was furan (Fig. 3).63 The BHJ devices based on SD-5-C and a simple PBI acceptor were systematically optimized by post treatment including TA and solvent vapor annealing (SVA). But both methods cannot suppress the phase separation and reduce the aggregation domains. In contrast, the solvent additive of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) changed the blend morphology to some extent, giving an improved but low PCE of 0.032%. Over-crystallization with large domain sizes was proposed to be responsible for the low device performance.
3.2 DPP-ended small molecule donors

3.2.1 Blend with fused aromatic core based NFAs. 
The well-developed benzodithiophene (BDT) has been used to construct many polymers, some of which give high photovoltaic efficiency over 14%.78,79 The DPP unit has been designed to copolymerize with BDT monomers giving rise to attractive donor polymers such as PD-8. A series of BDT-cored small molecules with DPP end groups and thiophene (T) spacers have been synthesized for application in NFOSCs. Lin and co-workers reported this kind of BDT-DPP small molecule.65 The molecule with 2-ethylhexyl (EH) as the alkyl-chain is denoted as SD-6-E (Fig. 4, E presents the DPP units used as end groups), while the molecule with n-octyl thio-substitution is denoted as SD-7-E. In an earlier report, SD-6-E was used to blend with a steric IDT-2PBI molecular acceptor to achieve a PCE of 3.12%, although the SD-6-E:IDT-2PBI film displayed low and unbalanced charge mobilities.66 The linear n-C8 side chains and sulfur atom enabled SD-7-E to exhibit lower HOMO/LUMO levels and higher hole mobility than SD-6-E. A fused ring electron acceptor IEIC was used to combine these DPP-based small molecules as donors to fabricate NFOSCs. SD-7-E:IEIC cells gave a higher Voc of 0.93 V, Jsc of 9.80 mA cm−2, FF of 0.58 and PCE of 5.29% than those of SD-6-E:IEIC (0.90 V, 8.24 mA cm−2, 0.54 and 4.00%, Table 3). Notably, the inverted device based on SD-7-E:IEIC showed an even higher PCE exceeding 6%.65 Studies of AFM, GIWAXS and R-SoXS clearly revealed that the optimal morphology is sensitive to both the molecular side chains and processing solvents (Fig. 5). A small amount of o-DCB can effectively reduce the domain sizes in the SD-7-E:IEIC blend without sacrificing the high crystallinity.

 Fig. 5  AFM phase images of SD-6-E:IEIC (a–c) and SD-7-E:IEIC (d–f) blend films coated from CHCl3 (a and d), o-DCB (b and e) and CHCl3/o-DCB (c and f) respectively. Reproduced from ref. 65 with permission from The Royal Society of Chemistry. 
Huo et al. reported SD-8-E and SD-9-E (Fig. 4) with modified BDT units.68 Both molecules showed complementary absorption and appropriate energy levels (HOMO/LUMO of −5.04/−3.46 eV for SD-8-E and −5.07/−3.43 eV for SD-9-E) compared to both fullerene (PC61BM with HOMO/LUMO of −5.93/−3.91 eV) and non-fullerene (IDIC with HOMO/LUMO of −5.69/−3.91 eV) acceptors. All combinations of SD-8-E:PC61BM, SD-8-E:IDIC, SD-9-E:PC61BM and SD-9-E:IDIC gave attractive performance in the conventional ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BHJ layer/PDIN/Al structure. The SD-8-E:PC61BM device exhibited a better Voc of 0.828 V, Jsc of 10.92 mA cm−2, FF of 0.61 and PCE of 5.53%, compared to SD-8-E:IDIC giving a Voc of 0.811 V, Jsc of 10.16 mA cm−2, FF of 0.58 and PCE of 4.80%. In contrast, the non-fullerene device based on SD-9-E:IDIC displayed better performance (Voc of 0.820 V, Jsc of 11.30 mA cm−2, FF of 0.59 and PCE of 5.48%) than its fullerene based device (Voc of 0.830 V, Jsc of 7.32 mA cm−2, FF of 0.57 and PCE of 3.48%). Obviously, for SD-8-E, the PCE of the PC61BM based device just exceeds that based on IDIC by 0.73%, while for SD-9-E, the PCE of the IDIC based device surpasses that of PC61BM by 2%. This indicates that, compared to the PC61BM-based devices, the performance of IDIC-based cells is less sensitive to donor structures of SD-8-E and SD-9-E. Note that the SD-9-E:IDIC device with an efficiency of 5.48% has outperformed those based on the DPP polymer donors, as discussed above.
Lately, in another report by Jung, SD-8-E was applied to blend with ITIC and [6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) respectively.69 After morphology optimization by solvent additives, SD-8-E:ITIC gave a higher PCE of 5.95% than SD-8-E:PC71BM of 5.35%. In addition, by applying side chain engineering, they designed SD-10-E with alkyl-thiol substituted thieno[3,2-b]thiophene on the phenyl ring of BDT (Fig. 4).70 In comparison with that of SD-8-E, the HOMO level of SD-10-E is downward deeper, resulting in a decreased Voc of 0.85 V for SD-10-E:ITIC, compared to that of SD-8-E:ITIC (0.94 V). On the other hand, the Jsc and FF of SD-10-E:ITIC were distinctly improved to 13.35 mA cm−2 and 0.63, boosting the PCE up to 7.15% (Table 3). Morphology investigation of the film revealed optimal phase separation and crystalline domains within 20 nm optimized by both solvent additive and TA, ensuring balanced hole/electron transport and high incident photon-to-current efficiency up to 69%.
Porphyrin represents another important building block in constructing a large amount of photovoltaic materials.80,81 The application of porphyrins in solar cells is mainly inspired by natural photosynthetic systems, specifically chlorophylls. The electron-rich π-conjugated system endows the porphyrin core with strong electron donating ability. However, distributions of the Frontier energy levels (HOMO and LUMO) on the porphyrin core are almost the same. This is unfavorable for exciton dissociation and charge generation in OSCs. Therefore, electron deficient DPP units can be used to conjugate with the porphyrin core to accept the excited electrons forming a donor–acceptor structure.
Hadmojo et al. reported three porphyrin-cored small molecule donors SD-11-E to SD-13-E with two T-DPP-T ends linked with ethynylene units respectively.71 The film absorption is extended to the NIR region. A fused ring electron acceptor IDIC was selected to construct BHJ active layers. After optimization with solvent additives, including DIO and pyridine, SD-11-E:IDIC gave a PCE of 6.13%, higher than 5.21% of SD-12-E:IDIC and 4.08% of SD-13-E:IDIC. Morphology and crystallinity analysis revealed that both SD-11-E and IDIC intended to orient in face-on mode in SD-11-E:IDIC, while edge-on mode was preferred for SD-12-E in SD-12-E:IDIC and SD-13-E in SD-13-E:IDIC. In addition, the face-on orientation of IDIC in the blend films with SD-11-E and SD-12-E was diminished in SD-13-E:IDIC. Since face-on orientation can facilitate efficient vertical charge transport in OSCs, so the SD-11-E based device showed a higher Jsc of 15.46 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.56 than SD-12-E (Jsc = 14.03 mA cm−2, FF = 0.53) and SD-13-E (Jsc = 11.46 mA cm−2, FF = 0.51). As revealed by the steady-state space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method, the blend film of SD-11-E:IDIC displayed higher charge mobilities (μh = 1.12 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 S−1, μe = 1.11 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 S−1) and a more balanced hole/electron mobility ratio (μh/μe = 1.01).71
In another very recent report by Gao et al., the non-fullerene system of SD-14-E:6TIC was systemically investigated. Both these two molecules have been reported elsewhere.82,83 According to the earlier literature, SD-14-E and 6TIC display distinct crystallization behavior.82,84 This provides a good opportunity to use different post-deposition methods to gain appropriate phase separation and domain sizes. As a result, through combined solvent additive and solvent vapor annealing methods, a sequentially evolved hierarchical crystalline morphology was realized. The optimal SD-14-E:6TIC device in the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Active layer/C60-bissalt/Ag configuration gave a PCE of up to 12.08% with a high Jsc of 20.44 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.74, which is the highest efficiency for non-fullerene small molecule OSCs to date.72


3.2.2 Blend with rylene diimide based NFAs. 
Rylene diimides, such as NDI and PBI, are another important family of non-fullerene materials. Some DPP molecules were also designed to study their photovoltaic performance with rylene diimides as electron acceptors. For all small molecule OSCs, the π–π stacking and domain sizes are determining factors for device performance. Huang et al. studied the effects of introduction of alkylthienyl units into 2D BDT-DPP small molecules on the performance of corresponding NFOSCs.67 Replacing the alkylthienyl units on the BDT of SD-6-E with alkoxyl units yielded SD-15-E (Fig. 4). Inserting two alkylthienyl units between BDT and the inner thiophene on the DPP of SD-6-E produced SD-16-E. According to X-ray diffraction (XRD), absorption spectra and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the π–π stacking strength and crystalline domain sizes followed the sequence: SD-15-E > SD-6-E > SD-16-E. A PBI derivative, bis-PBI-T-EG, was selected as the electron acceptor. After morphology optimization by tuning the D/A weight ratio and solvent additive, the domain size of SD-15-E:bis-PDI-T-EG was about 50–80 nm, while it was reduced to 30–50 nm and 10–30 nm for SD-6-E:bis-PDI-T-EG and SD-16-E:bis-PDI-T-EG blends. The moderate domain size and crystallinity of SD-6-E:bis-PDI-T-EG is beneficial for high and balanced hole and electron mobilities (0.022/0.016 cm2 V−1 S−1), leading to better performance with Jsc (4.66 mA cm−2), Voc (0.92 V), FF (0.47) and PCE (2.01%). Moreover, they synthesized a thiophene-spaced two BDT unit (BDT-T-BDT) cored small molecule donor SD-17-E (Fig. 4).73 Probably due to the reduced co-planarity of the whole molecular structure, the band gap of SD-17-E is smaller than that of SD-6-E. However, after a similar optimized process, the SD-17-E:bis-PDI-T-EG device gave a low PCE of 1.62% with a Jsc of 3.79 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.83 V and FF of 0.51 (Table 3). This was attributed to the large domain sizes of 30–80 nm revealed by AFM, resulting in insufficient exciton diffusion into the D/A interface.73
It is reported that electron deficient units in conjugated molecules can narrow the band gap and lower the LUMO level. Feng et al. synthesized a small molecule donor SD-18-E with two T-DPP-T units capping on the pentacyclic aromatic bislactam (PCL) core (Fig. 4).74 Due to the electron-deficient nature of both DPP and PCL, SD-18-E exhibited a wide absorption range between 500 and 800 nm and displayed a low band gap of 1.65 eV. Two PBI derivatives, SdiPBI and SdiPBI-S, with complementary absorption between 400 and 600 nm, were selected to form BHJ blends respectively. The SD-18-E:SdiPBI cell provided the optimal PCE of 2.4% with a Jsc of 6.1 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.92 V and FF of 0.42 (Table 3). The corresponding SD-18-E:SdiPBI-S device gave a high PCE of 3.5% with an enhanced Jsc of 6.7 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.96 V, and FF of 0.53. However, both PCEs are relatively low compared to that of SD-18-E:PC61BM (4.8%). Large phase separation between PBI acceptors and SD-18-E was observed to be responsible for the low performance.
The BHJ blends of the polymer acceptor N2200 and DPP capped small molecule donors have also been studied. As shown in Fig. 4, small molecule SD-19-E with the A–D–A type structure, comprising two DPP end groups and the electron rich core 5H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyran (DTP), was reported by Jung and co-workers.75SD-19-E showed broad absorption between 500 and 800 nm, a high hole mobility of 0.18 cm2 V−1 S−1 as measured using a field-effect transistor (FET) device and strong crystalline properties. In the blend, the PL of SD-19-E and N2200 can be almost completely quenched, indicating that the photo-generated excitons from both the donor and acceptor are readily dissociated into free charge carriers at their interfaces. The optimized device based on SD-19-E:N2200 gave a maximum PCE of 4.82% (Voc = 0.82 V, Jsc = 10.14 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.58, Table 3). Although the Jsc is relatively low, the FF is comparable to that of SD-19-E:PC71BM, indicating efficient charge transport in the blend film of SD-19-E:N2200.
Almost at the same time, Tang et al. reported a small molecule donor SD-20-E with the thieno[2,3-f]benzofuran (TBF) core (Fig. 4).76 The only difference between TBF and the well-used donor unit BDT is that one of the sulfur atoms of BDT is replaced by oxygen. This small modification can provide better co-planarity and π–π stacking and cause a down shift of the HOMO level for SD-20-E. When blended with N2200, the PL of SD-20-E was efficiently quenched, while the PL of N2200 was greatly retained, indicating that the exciton dissociation from SD-20-E to N2200, i.e., channel I is the main route of the photocurrent generation. But this situation can be dramatically improved by adding solvent additive 1-chloronaphthalene (CN), leading to smaller N2200 domains. The optimized SD-20-E:N2200 device exhibited higher charge carrier mobilities and lower radiative and non-radiative energy losses than those of SD-20-E:PCBM, giving superior performance (PCE = 3.7%, Voc = 0.81 V, Jsc = 7.6 mA cm−2, FF = 0.60, Table 3). More importantly, the charge transfer energy loss (ΔE) is only 0.06 eV for SD-20-E:N2200 but doesn't result in reduced exciton dissociation efficiency, affording high internal quantum efficiency (IQE) up to 75%.
Different from planar DPP-based small molecule donors discussed above, two 3D-shaped donor molecules SD-21-E and SD-22-E (Fig. 4) have been developed by Liu and co-workers.77 Four DPP units were attached to a tetraphenylmethane core for SD-21-E or a tetraphenylsilane core for SD-22-E. Both SD-21-E and SD-22-E films showed strong absorption with two peaks at 580 and 640 nm. The polymer acceptor N2200 with a complementary absorption around 400 and 700 nm was used. This was clearly reflected in the IPCE spectra where N2200 based devices displayed much higher quantum efficiencies than those based on PC71BM. So both non-fullerene SD-21-E:N2200 and SD-22-E:N2200 devices gave higher PCEs of 4.64% and 4.02% compared to SD-21-E:PC71BM and SD-22-E:PC71BM with PCEs of 3.56% and 3.22%, respectively (Table 3). Small 3D-shaped donor molecules were expected to form proper BHJ blends with polymer acceptors. So the N2200-based films exhibited higher and more balanced charge mobilities than those of PC71BM, ensuring relatively higher FF, especially for SD-21-E:N2200 with a FF of 0.62.

3.3 Summary
To briefly summarize in this part, DPP-based small molecules as electron donors for NFOSCs could provide high PCEs, even surpassing the PCEs when using fullerene derivatives as electron acceptors. Among them, small molecules with porphyrin as the core and DPP as end groups showed the highest performance in small molecule OSCs, indicating their promising application in the future. The photovoltaic performance of DPP-based small molecules as donors is also obviously much higher than those with DPP-based polymer donors. It is also worth mentioning that DPP-based small molecules always provided NIR absorption spectra, so their combination with wide band gap rylene diimide acceptors would show complementary absorption. However, the performance of these kinds of cells is still low compared with fused ring electron acceptors.
4. DPP-based polymer acceptors
DPP-polymers can not only display high hole mobility but also exhibit excellent electron mobility in FETs.35 Therefore, DPP-polymers as electron acceptors can be potentially applied in NFOSCs. Starting from a simple DPP-polymer donor PD-1, the thiophene bridges were replaced by electron-withdrawing thiazole to construct the DPP-polymer acceptor PA-1-a (Fig. 6). Compared to PD-1, the HOMO and LUMO levels of PA-1-a are down-shifted by about 0.33 and 0.26 eV respectively. In addition, PA-1-a exhibited an electron mobility of 0.13 cm2 V−1 s−1 in FET devices, indicating that PA-1-a could be a good electron acceptor. The optimized device based on all DPP-polymers PD-3:PA-1-a in the active layer gave a PCE of 2.9% (Jsc = 6.9 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.81 V and FF = 0.51, Table 4). The structural similarity between PA-1-a and PD-3 leads to poor phase separation, resulting in low charge transport efficiency.

Compared with PA-1-a, the only difference in PA-1-b is the alkyl side chains (Fig. 6). In the former the branched alkyl is 2-hexyldecyl, while in the latter it is 2-octyldodecyl. Photovoltaic properties of PA-1-b were examined by blending with the standard polymer donor poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), which is a cost-effective and commercial available material.85 As a result, the P3HT:PA-1-b device displayed a low Voc of 0.64 V, which was due to the high-lying Frontier levels of P3HT. Thanks to the improved Jsc of 7.8 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.61, the best PCE was 3% which was comparable to that of PD-3:PA-1-a solar cells (Table 4). The improved photocurrent should result from the better phase separation between PA-1-b and P3HT. Replacing copolymerized thiophene in PA-1-a with benzodithiophene, bithiophene or dithienopyrrole derivatives, three other polymers PA-2, PA-3, and PA-4 were obtained (Fig. 6).85 Compared to PA-1-b, the HOMO and LUMO levels are raised from PA-2 to PA-4. This could directly result in the reduced driving force of exciton dissociation between P3HT and the acceptors. In addition, the morphologies of these blended films are still not optimal in terms of having the appropriate balance between pure crystalline domains and amorphous mixed regions for efficient exciton diffusion, charge generation and transport. All these factors lead to PCEs lower than 3%.
Tunable Frontier energy levels were realized in three DPP polymers with repeating units Tz-DPP-Tz for PA-5, Tz-DPP-Tz-FBDT for PA-6 and Tz-DPP-Tz-NDI for PA-7 (Fig. 6), where Tz is thiazole, FBDT is perfluoroalkyl thiophene substituted BDT and NDI is naphthalene diimide respectively.56 When using a DPP-polymer PD-3 as the donor (Fig. 2), the solar cells always gave disappointing performance due to the poor phase separation. Further, a series of random copolymers based on Tz-DPP-Tz were prepared, in which thiophene and FBDT were incorporated into the polymers PA-1-b, and PA-8 to PA-12 (Fig. 6).55 Different high boiling point solvent additives, including 1-chloronaphthalene (1-CN), IC4F8I and IC6F12I were used to improve the morphology of BHJ films when using the donor polymer PD-3 (Fig. 2). Interestingly, for FBDT containing polymers, perfluoroalkyl-based additives can distinctly enhance the device performance.90 Taking PD-3:PA-12 as an example, when the solvent additive 1-CN was switched to IC6F12I, the PCE was increased from 0.52% to 2.1%. SCLC measurement revealed more balanced hole and electron mobilities with the μh/μe ratio decreasing from 265 to 25 for 1-CN and IC6F12I respectively.
As mentioned above, DPP units were usually copolymerized with electron-rich groups such as oligothiophene, BDT or dithienopyrrole to tune the Frontier energy levels. Some reports also use electron-deficient units to build DPP-polymer acceptors in order to realize deep energy levels. For example, the electron deficient B ← N bridged bipyridine (BNBP)-based polymers can exhibit delocalized LUMOs over the whole conjugated polymer backbones.91,92 But the band gaps of BNBP-based polymers are usually too large to fulfill the requirements of ideal acceptors. So introduction of DPP is a good choice to reduce the optical band gap and broaden the absorption region. Long et al. reported a BNBP-DPP polymer PA-13 with good thermal stability (Fig. 6).86 The PTB7:PA-13 based device gave a maximum PCE of 2.69% and Jsc of 7.54 mA cm−2 with a broad EQE response from 300 to 800 nm. The film morphology indicated partial crystallization and XRD revealed the face-on orientation of the donor and acceptor in the blends. Nevertheless, the unbalanced charge mobilities could be responsible for the low performance.
Another electron withdrawing group, isoindigo (IID), was also used to conjugate with pyridine-flanked DPP (Py-DPP-Py) forming a new polymer PA-14.87 Compared to the common T-DPP-T unit, Py-DPP-Py is assumed to lower the HOMO levels of the polymer and provide a wider band gap. The LUMO and HOMO offsets between PA-14 and two polymer donors PBDTTS–FTAZ and PTB7-Th are 0.78/0.28 eV and 0.27/0.34 eV respectively, which are large enough to drive exciton diffusion. The high-lying LUMO level of PA-14 can ensure a large Voc of up to 1.07 eV and low Eloss (Table 4). More complementary absorption spectra between PBDTTS–FTAZ and PA-14 provide the device with a higher PCE of 4.2% which is among the best PCEs of all-polymer solar cells using DPP-based polymer acceptors. It is noteworthy that the device based on PBDTTS–FTAZ:PA-14 exhibits good stability.
Fluorination on conjugated polymers is an effective way to lower both HOMO and LUMO levels without changing the band gap. The introduction of the electronegative fluorine atom can strengthen the non-covalent interactions of F⋯H and S⋯F without causing severe steric hindrance, and thus enhance intermolecular aggregation and improve the morphology of blend films. Chen et al. designed a DPP-polymer PA-15 (Fig. 6) with a thieno[2,3-b]pyridine flanked DPP unit alternated with 3,4-difluorothiophene.88 The band gap of PA-15 is 1.7 eV and the LUMO level is about 0.4 eV lower than that of PTB7-Th. An all-polymer solar cell based on PTB7-Th:PA-15 gave an optimal PCE of 2.72% with a Jsc of 6.57 mA cm−2 (Table 4). The cell had a high Voc of 1.04 V which can be attributed to the higher electron affinity of PA-15 compared to PC71BM. The moderate FF of 0.40 should be attributed to the poor phase separation between the donor and acceptor. The polymers PA-16 and PA-17 (Fig. 6) with an asymmetric DPP-monomer copolymerized with bifluorothiophene or thienothiophene were also developed, but they provided low PCEs of 0.28% and 0.44% when using P3HT as the electron donor.89
To conclude this part, DPP-polymers exhibit high electron mobilities in FETs so that they can be used as electron acceptors in NFOSCs. Actually, DPP-polymers also show high extinction coefficiency in the NIR region compared to naphthalene diimide based polymers, such as N2200. This property is highly important since they can sufficiently absorb sunlight in the NIR region, contributing to high photocurrent. Although the cells based on these DPP-polymers as electron acceptors could also provide PCEs above 4%, this was apparently far away from other kinds of cells. Currently, most of the DPP-polymer acceptors were used to combine with polymer donors, in which the microphase separation between them was difficult to optimize. An interesting application might be to use these DPP-polymer acceptors to combine with small molecule donors to achieve high performance NFOSCs.
5. DPP-based small molecule acceptors
Among the four classes of DPP-based semiconductors applied in NFOSCs, the fourth class of DPP-based small molecule acceptors has been widely studied.93–96 For clarification, all these small molecules will be discussed in two parts, i.e., DPP-cored small molecule acceptors and DPP-ended small molecule acceptors. In each part, they will be further classified according to the electron donor used or the molecule native structures respectively. Discussion of this section will help to deliver a panoramic development status of DPP-based small molecule acceptors in NFOSCs. After the introduction of these molecular acceptors, we will try to summarize the design rules as well as perspectives for the development of DPP-based small molecule NFAs.
5.1 DPP-cored small molecule acceptors
It has been realized that the matched D/A pairs are important for accomplishing high photovoltaic performance. By listing all the DPP-cored small molecule acceptors in the literature, we find that the research of using the representing P3HT donor is comparable to that based on non-P3HT donors. We therefore divide this part into two sub-classes, as a blend with P3HT as the electron donor and a blend with non-P3HT as the electron donor.

5.1.1 Blend with P3HT as the electron donor. 
Groups of Janssen and Chen pioneered the research of DPP-based small molecule acceptors in 2010, by synthesizing SA-1-C to SA-4-C and SA-5-C to SA-8-C (Fig. 7) respectively.97,98 The device based on the P3HT and trifluoromethylphenyl containing acceptor SA-6-C showed a PCE of 1%. Eom et al. reported three A1–π–A2–π–A1-type small molecules SA-9-C to SA-11-C with the DPP core as A2 (Fig. 7).99 The Frontier energy levels of SA-9-C to SA-11-C are located between those of P3HT and PC71BM. So all three molecules could be used to fabricate devices with PC71BM or P3HT acting as the electron donor or acceptor respectively. In the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/LiF/Al configuration, the device based on P3HT:SA-9-C gave a higher PCE value of 1.28% (Table 5), exceeding that of SA-9-C:PC71BM (0.92%), while the P3HT:SA-11-C cell gave a PCE of 0.77% and SA-9-C:PC71BM gave a negligible PCE of 0.02%. However, when the hole transport layer LiF was replaced by poly[(9,9-bis[3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl]-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN), the PCE of P3HT:SA-11-C could be improved to 1.14% under identical conditions. A small amount of solvent additive DIO could further enhance the PCE to 2.16% (Table 5).100 This clearly demonstrated the significance of fabrication techniques including thermal/solvent annealing and interface engineering etc. in the device performance. Rational combination of SA-11-C with other donors could achieve even higher PCEs, which will be discussed in the next section. A series of DPP-cored small molecules SA-12-C to SA-14-C with cyanide groups were also reported by Lim's group (Fig. 7).101 When using P3HT as the donor, the cells could only give low PCEs ranging from 0.23% to 0.54% (Table 5). However, the ternary approach, with P3HT as one donor and SA-12-C:SA-14-C as bi-acceptors, could afford higher PCEs of 1% owing to a synergistic effect of the two acceptors.

The great influence of alkyl side chains on the performance of the resulting photovoltaic devices has attracted wide attention in recent years. This was well demonstrated by Josse et al. by designing SA-15-C to SA-18-C (Fig. 7), which have the same molecular backbone of two 5-ethynyl-phthalimide (PI) elongating on the T-DPP-T core with varying alkyl chains on the N-position of both DPP and PI end groups.102 UV-vis absorption spectra from solution to solid films indicated J-aggregates in SA-15-C and SA-16-C films but H-aggregates in SA-17-C and SA-18-C films. It was assumed that the length and branching point of the alkyl chains at PI moieties had negligible effects on the molecular packing, but it was strongly related to the substituents attached on the DPP core. Electron mobilities of ca. 1.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1 for SA-15-C and 1.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1 for SA-16-C are almost one order of magnitude higher than that of SA-17-C (2.8 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 S−1) and SA-18-C (4.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 S−1). BHJ OSCs of four DPP-based small molecule acceptors with P3HT as the electron donor were fabricated in the ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag configuration. The performance of solar cells based on SA-15-C and SA-16-C with branched alkyls on DPP could be obviously improved by DIO addition to 3.23% and 1.10% respectively, while for solar cells based on SA-17-C and SA-18-C, addition of DIO played a negligible, or even negative role with both PCEs below 0.2%. In addition, when the DPP core of SA-15-C was replaced by thienoisoindigo (TII), the new acceptor could only have a low PCE of 0.4% when using P3HT as the donor.103
Another structural modification is the π-conjugated connector namely a thiophene or a thiazole ring for SA-19-C and SA-20-C respectively with the same DPP core and two PI end-capped groups (Fig. 7).104 The optical band gap of SA-19-C is ca. 0.06 eV lower than that of SA-20-C. Both experimental and calculated Frontier energy levels of SA-19-C are deeper than those of SA-20-C by ca. 0.02–0.03 eV. Solar cells in the ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Al configuration were fabricated using P3HT as the electron donor. After TA treatment, the devices for both SA-19-C and SA-20-C gave comparable PCEs of 0.55% and 0.40% respectively. Similar to that of SA-15-C, all three parameters, including Jsc, Voc and FF, can be increased by the addition of 2% (v/v) DIO leading to a maximum PCE of ca. 1.3% for SA-19-C (Table 5).
The naphthalimide (NI) capped small molecule SA-21-C (Fig. 7) with the NI-T-T-DPP-T-T-NI structure was reported by Chen and co-workers.105SA-21-C could be used as both the electron donor and acceptor in blends with PCBM and P3HT, providing comparable PCEs of 0.76% and 0.60% respectively. The Eg of the analogue NI-T-DPP-T-NI molecule SA-22-C (Fig. 8) is much larger than that of SA-21-C (1.72 to 1.59 eV), indicating the key role of the connecting thiophene length in the electronic properties.109SA-22-C-based NFOSCs fabricated with another widely used polymer donor PTB7-Th will be discussed in the next section.
 Fig. 8  DPP-cored small molecule acceptors blended with non-P3HT as the donor for NFOSCs. 
According to the report by Hendsbee et al., the analogue SA-23-C (Fig. 7) with PI as capping groups shows a similar Eg of 1.70 eV.106 Devices based on DPP cored SA-23-C exhibited comparable PCEs with both polymer donor P3HT and small molecule donor DTS(FBTTh2)2 (0.27% and 0.37% respectively, Table 5), while corresponding small molecule acceptors with other core groups of phthalimide, isoindigo, naphthalene diimide and perylene diimide can only give considerable PCEs with either the P3HT or DTS(FBTTh2)2 donor. These results demonstrate that DPP-cored small molecule acceptors can match well with different kinds of donor materials. We will emphasize on the application of DPP cored small molecule acceptors blended with non-P3HT donors in the next section.


5.1.2 Blend with non-P3HT donors. 
For SA-22-C (Fig. 8), one effect of the end capped NI groups is the relatively high-lying LUMO level, which is helpful to increase the Voc of the solar cell.109 When fabricated with the polymer donor PTB7-Th in the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al configuration, the device afforded a PCE of 0.64% with a low Jsc of 1.76 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.316 but a high Voc of up to 1.12 V. The low Jsc and FF could be substantially improved by using other device configurations, such as ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN/Al and ITO/ZnO/PFN/active layer/MoO3/Al. In the former case, Jsc, FF and PCE increased to 3.12 mA cm−2, 0.458 and 1.64%, while in the latter they increased to 3.55 mA cm−2, 0.340 and 1.43% respectively. This unambiguously suggests the significant effect of the device configuration on the photovoltaic performance.
As one of the typical rylene diimide-based NFA materials, perylene bisimide (PBI) was introduced to connect with T-DPP-T giving the small molecule acceptor SA-24-C (Fig. 8).110 The absorption onset of the SA-24-C thin film is ca. 760 nm corresponding to the Eg of 1.63 eV. As revealed by the UV-vis spectra, compared to that of the as-cast thin film, the SA-24-C film showed a distinct blue-shift (75 nm) and the appearance of a sharp peak at 586 nm after CHCl3 vapor annealing. However, there was negligible difference after TA. The photovoltaic performance of SA-24-C was evaluated using the inverted device in the ITO/ZnO/BHJ/MoOx/Ag structure using PTB7-Th as the donor. PTB7-Th showed complementary absorption spectra to SA-24-C, so the blended film displayed panchromatic absorption. After appropriate SVA with 2–5 min, not only the PCE increased from 2.2% to 5.6%, but also a 2-fold enhancement of external quantum efficiency (EQE) at 586 nm was observed where SA-24-C dominantly contributes to the photocurrent. It is notable that SVA in 10 min was detrimental to the device performance. By comparing with three other polymer donors including P3HT, PCDTBT and PDTT-BOBT, the peak at 586 nm in EQE spectra seems to be independent of the donor used. As a result, PDTT-BOBT was identified as a simple and promising competitor for PTB7-Th with PCEs up to 4.5% (Table 6). However, one disadvantage of the PDTT-BOBT based device was the inferior stability, which should be attributed to the alkoxy side chains on the polymer backbone suffering from C–O bond cleavage under irradiation.

In another report by Liu et al., the BODIPY units were anchored to the T-DPP-T core through two ethynylene spacers in SA-25-C (Fig. 8).108 The 2-hexyldecyl chains could significantly improve the solubility compared to the analogue with 2-ethylhexyl groups. The application of SA-25-C in BHJ solar cells was systematically studied by using a series of donor materials including P3HT, p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and PTB7-Th. All the binary devices gave low PCEs close to 1%, mainly due to the low Vocs. Especially for the P3HT system, the Voc was 0.52 V. It is surprising to observe that the corresponding ternary system, consisting of two kinds of donor materials, can give much better performance. When PTB7-Th and p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 were used as co-donors, the resulting ternary system gave an average PCE of 2.84% with Jsc = 7.03 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.761 V and FF = 0.530 (Table 6). By investigating the film morphology, it was found that SA-25-C exhibited a preferential face-on orientation in the ternary system, which was favorable for the vertical charge transport in BHJ films.
As reported by Privado and co-workers, SA-11-C can not only blend with P3HT but also work with a medium band gap polymeric dithienosilole donor P (Fig. 9) in NFOSCs, providing an optimized PCE of up to 7.52% through appropriate optimization using DIO as the solvent additive (Table 6).100 Rhodamine (Rh) was further modified with dicyanomethylene-3-ethylrhodanine-rhodamine (RhCN) in SA-26-C (Fig. 8), with the Eg decreasing from 1.48 eV to 1.41 eV.111 Both SA-11-C and SA-26-C were used to fabricate BHJ OSCs with a dithienosilole based small molecule donor DTS(QxHTh2)2 (Fig. 9). The EQE of the DTS(QxHTh2)2:SA-26-C cell was slightly higher than that of the DTS(QxHTh2)2:SA-11-C cell. The former gave a higher Jsc of 11.33 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 6.28% (Table 6). For SA-26-C, apart from the favorable energy offsets with the donor, its blend shows higher mobilities and more balanced charge transport than those of SA-11-C (μh = 1.04 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe = 5.26 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for D:SA-26-C while μh = 9.92 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe = 3.96 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for D:SA-11-C). This should be related to the higher electron affinity of RhCN than Rh. In an effort to optimize the device performance, two kinds of post-deposition treatment, i.e. TA and dryness under vacuum (VD), were compared. As a result, for both SA-11-C and SA-26-C based devices, the Jsc and FF values of VD active layers were higher than those by using the TA method, but Vocs remained the same. Especially for the case of SA-26-C, the overall PCE was distinctly increased to 7.34% (Table 6). The crystallinity of the active layers was investigated by XRD. The intensities of diffraction peaks for the VD processed active layer were higher than those of the TA treated active layer, indicating higher crystallinity and molecular ordering in the former active layer, which is beneficial for charge transport.
 Fig. 9  Structures of three donors blended with SA-11-C, SA-26-C and SA-27-C as electron acceptors. 
However, for another case of the elongated RhCN end capped DPP-based small molecule acceptor SA-27-C (Fig. 8), SVA treatment also worked in the blend of p-DINI-(FBTTTh3)2:SA-27-C.112 The structure of p-DINI-(FBTTTh3)2 is shown in Fig. 9. Better phase separation with 20–25 nm domains and higher crystallinity could be obtained by applying CS2 vapor annealing. With the improved Jsc and FF, the PCE exhibited an enhancement from 3.98% to the champion 9.14% (Table 6) before and after the SVA treatment, respectively. It is worth noting that as the ΔEHOMO between DINI-(FBTTTh3)2 and SA-27-C is reduced to 0.36 eV, the Eloss value of the device is just 0.54 eV, consistent with the high Voc up to 1.02 eV which has been rarely observed in PCBM based devices.
As a typically strong electron-withdrawing unit, 1,1,4,4-tetracyanobuta-1,3-diene (TCBD) can not only enhance the electron affinity and promote the formation of the charge transport, but also can provide good solubility because of the molecular nonplanarity. From this aspect, Patil and co-workers reported a series of TCBD containing DPP-based small molecule acceptors SA-28-C to SA-33-C (Fig. 8). For mono-substituted SA-28-C and double-substituted SA-29-C, the end-capped group extending on TCBD is triphenylamine (TPA), and the Eg is decreased from 1.58 eV (mono-substitution) to 1.46 eV (double-substitution).113 For mono-substituted SA-30-C and double-substituted SA-31-C, the end capped group is N-phenylene carbazole, with only one ethynylene transformed to TCBD in SA-31-C during the synthesis.114 The Eg is decreased from 1.52 eV of SA-30-C to 1.36 eV of SA-31-C. For mono-substituted SA-32-C and double-substituted SA-33-C, the end capped group is ferrocene which has been rarely reported in acceptor materials, with the Eg decreasing from 1.49 eV of SA-32-C to 1.42 eV of SA-33-C.115 Three different donor polymers P1, P2 and P3 (Fig. 10), with complementary absorption to these acceptors, were used to fabricate NFOSCs with SA-28-C and SA-29-C, SA-30-C and SA-31-C, SA-32-C and SA-33-C respectively. All devices were fabricated in the conventional ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Al configuration. Among them, the double-substituted DPP-cored small molecule acceptors showed higher PCEs of 4.95% for SA-29-C, 7.19% for SA-31-C and 6.89% for SA-33-C compared to 3.90% for SA-28-C, 4.86% for SA-30-C and 6.44% for SA-32-C (Table 6). This showed that the double substituted molecules exhibited stronger aggregation and crystallinity and correspondingly higher charge mobilities.

5.2 DPP-ended small molecule acceptors
Focusing on these small molecule materials in this part, we will discuss these acceptors in several contexts according to the core structures, since most DPP-ended small molecules have been evaluated for their potential application in NFOSCs as electron acceptors combined with the classical polymer donor P3HT (Table 7).

5.2.1 Linear cores of BTD/benzene/naphthalene. 
Introducing electron-withdrawing building blocks into conjugated molecules has been proven an effective way to enhance electron affinity. The strong electron-withdrawing benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BTD) was used as the core flanked with T-DPP-T end groups by Raynor et al. affording SA-34-E (Fig. 11).116 The band gap calculated from the absorption onset of the SA-34-E film is 1.35 eV. NFOSCs based on SA-34-E and P3HT afforded a PCE of 1.16% with a high Voc of up to 1.08 V (Table 7), which should benefit from the difference between the HOMO of P3HT and the LUMO of SA-34-E as large as ∼1.10 eV. Jung and co-workers designed elongated SA-35-E and SA-36-E (Fig. 11) with one more thiophene spacer between the BTD core and DPP end groups.117 Compared to the bare BTD core in SA-35-E, difluoro-substituted DfBTD acts as the core in SA-36-E.38 Their band gaps are increased to 1.53 and 1.55 eV respectively. As revealed by the GIWAXS patterns of their pure films, SA-36-E showed both face-on and edge-on orientation in solid while SA-35-E had predominantly edge-on orientation. It is well known that the face-on orientation can afford more efficient charge transport in solar cells. As shown in Table 7, when blended with PTB7, SA-36-E afforded a PCE of 5.00% (Voc = 0.81 V, Jsc = 12.10 mA cm−2, FF = 0.51) compared to SA-35-E with a PCE of 3.03% (Voc = 0.83 V, Jsc = 7.77 mA cm−2, FF = 0.47). Compared to that of SA-34-E, the Voc was greatly reduced due to the difference between the HOMO of PTB7 and the LUMO of the acceptor less than 1 eV, while Jsc, especially for SA-36-E, was extremely high up to 12.10 mA cm−2 which was among the highest in DPP-based non-fullerene systems (Table 7). Notably, both devices exhibited low energy losses of ca. 0.6 eV.
 Fig. 11  DPP-ended small molecule acceptors. OD = 2-octyldecyl. 
Zhang et al. reported SA-37-E and SA-38-E (Fig. 11) with T-DPP-T capping on the phenylene or dimethyl phenylene respectively.118 DPP-based small molecules with the benzene core have wide band gaps of 1.75 eV for SA-37-E and 1.82 eV for SA-38-E. In the P3HT:SA blends, the PL of P3HT was quenched by ca. 90%, while the PL of acceptors was just quenched by 25% for SA-37-E and 34% for SA-38-E, indicating efficient electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor but less efficient hole transfer from the acceptor to the donor. This was further reflected by the low Jsc and FF values of only 1.45 mA cm−2/0.300 for the SA-37-E based device and 1.54 mA cm−2/0.373 for SA-38-E. The higher PCE of 0.65% for SA-38-E should mainly result from the higher electron mobility. In another report, Brandt et al. additionally synthesized a benzene-cored triangular molecule SA-39-E (Fig. 11).119 By combining them with P3HT, they found the processing-method dependent rule for this system. The PCEs of the spin-coated devices follow the order of SA-38-E (0.65%) > SA-37-E (0.48%) > SA-39-E (0.31%), while for the roll-coated devices, the order is SA-39-E (0.54%) > SA-38-E (0.43%) > SA-37-E (0.04%), as shown in Table 7. These results highlight the influence of the molecule structure and processing method on the performance of the DPP based NFOSCs.
The well-used naphthalene diimide (NDI) was also applied as the core with two flanking T-DPP-T units in SA-40-E (Fig. 11), with an Eg as low as 1.23 eV.120 Benefiting from the large gap of 1.3 eV between the LUMO of SA-40-E and the HOMO of P3HT, a high Voc of 1.05 V was achieved. As revealed by the EQE spectra, the device showed a wide photo-response throughout the visible light range from 300–850 nm, though with a moderate plateaus of 15% around 550 nm. However, in the FET of P3HT:SA-40-E, hole mobility contributed by P3HT can be measured while the electron mobility from SA-40-E cannot be observed. The unbalanced hole and electron mobilities result in a low Jsc of 2.15 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.45 and an overall PCE of just 1.02% (Table 7).


5.2.2 Star shaped cores of TPA/TEB. 
The cross-coupling reaction between the mono-brominated T-DPP-T-Br and the corresponding dioxaborolane or tributylstannylthiophenyl derivative of triphenylamine (TPA) provided star shaped small molecules SA-41-E and SA-42-E (Fig. 11) respectively.121,122 The band gap of SA-42-E estimated from the absorbance onset of the film is 1.77 eV, lower than 1.84 eV of SA-41-E. Considering the well matched energy levels between P3HT and the SA, the BHJ solar cells were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:SA/Ca/Al. All HOMO and LUMO offsets between the donor and acceptors are higher than 0.3 eV, ensuring enough driving force for exciton dissociation on the D/A interface. The gaps between the LUMO of both acceptors and the HOMO of P3HT are large, even up to 1.5 eV. As a result, the SA-42-E based device gave a PCE of 0.63% with a Voc up to 1.14 V and the SA-41-E gave a PCE of 0.54% with a Voc of up to 1.12 V (Table 7). Moreover, in another report by Lin et al., the performance of the SA-41-E based device can be evidently improved to 1.20% by TA at 150 °C for 10 min.
The triethynylbenzene (TEB) cored analogue SA-43-E was reported by Yu and co-workers.123 Similar to the TPA counterparts, the BHJ devices based on P3HT:SA-43-E also gave a high Voc of up to 1.11 V. The PCE could be optimized to 1.08% by adjusting the D/A weight ratio and TA treatment.


5.2.3 Cylindrical cores of [2,2]paracyclophane. 
[2,2]Paracyclophane, a rigid and cylindrical framework, is known for the transannular π–π interaction and can be readily functionalized via different ways. Zhang's group designed [2,2]paracyclophane cored small molecule acceptors SA-44-E and SA-45-E (Fig. 11) with four T-DPP-T end arms.124 The trifluorophenyl group on SA-45-E is intended to adjust the Frontier energy levels. The band gaps are 1.80 eV and 1.70 eV for SA-44-E and SA-45-E respectively. P3HT was used as the donor. The differences between LUMOs of the SA acceptors and the HOMO of P3HT are both larger than 1.2 eV, providing high Vocs of the P3HT:SA devices. After optimization by varying the D/A weight ratio and TA treatment, the SA-44-E based device provided a PCE of 2.05% and Voc of 1.06 V (Jsc = 4.18 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.46) and SA-45-E had a PCE of 2.69% and Voc of 0.90 V (Jsc = 5.88 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.51), as shown in Table 7. The lower Voc of SA-45-E is consistent with its deeper LUMO level. The trend of the EQE spectra agreed well with the absorption spectra of the blend films, indicating considerable contribution to Jscs from both acceptors.
For comparison, the reference molecule SA-46-E was also investigated simultaneously. Small molecule SA-46-E showed a similar band gap and Frontier energy levels to SA-45-E. However, the P3HT:SA-46-E device can only be optimized to a PCE of 0.90% in the same lab, indicating the advantage of the rigid and cylindrical [2,2]paracyclophane structure. Later, another two molecular acceptors, SA-47-E and SA-48-E (Fig. 11), were also developed.125 Similar processing conditions were adopted when using P3HT as the electron donor, but provided lower PCEs of 1.33% and 1.84% (Table 7) respectively. The low PCEs might be due to the low degree of inter-chain packing order of P3HT and poor thin film morphology.


5.2.4 Four-directional cores of TPE. 
Rananaware and co-workers adopted tetraphenylethene (TPE) as the core capped with four T-DPP-T units in SA-49-E (Fig. 11).126 The film of SA-49-E showed strong absorption in the range between 540 and 800 nm complementary to that of P3HT (380–610 nm). The energy level offsets between P3HT and SA-49-E are large enough to guarantee efficient exciton dissociation at their interface. The P3HT:SA-49-E device gave a PCE of 3.85% (Table 7). The Voc is up to 1.18 V which is among the highest for single BHJ devices based on P3HT as the donor. Note that TA treatment was detrimental to the device performance. The EQE spectra indicated a wide photo-response between 300 and 750 nm for P3HT:SA-49-E. Shi et al. reported the molecule SA-50-E (Fig. 11) with the same backbone but additional phenyl capping on T-DPP-T compared to SA-49-E.127 P3HT:SA-50-E based NFOSCs showed a photo-response from 300–700 nm and gave a lower PCE of 2.49%. SA-51-E with a biphenyl core only provided a low PCE of 1.18%, suggesting the advantage of the TPE chromophore for designing NFAs.
Above, most DPP-based small molecule acceptors can work well with P3HT with relatively high energy levels. In order to work with donors of low Frontier energy levels such as PTB7-Th, Sun et al. introduced the strong electron-withdrawing dicyanovinyl (DCV) at the end of SA-52-E with the same backbone of SA-49-E and SA-50-E to lower the Frontier energy levels. PTB7-Th:SA-52-E based NFOSCs had a PCE of 4.01%, higher than those of most other DPP-based small molecule acceptors. Although the Voc doesn't exceed 1 V, the improvement mainly comes from the Jsc of 9.89 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.538.128


5.2.5 Bent cores of fluorene/dibenzosilole/carbazole. 
The electron-rich fluorene is suitable as the core to construct A–D–A type small molecules with the T-DPP-T end. Bhosale's and Chen's groups developed small molecule acceptors SA-53-E,129SA-54-E130 and SA-55-E131 (Fig. 11) with tunable alkyl chains on central fluorene and different capping groups on the peripheral thiophene, respectively. The films of SA-53-E and SA-54-E showed absorption bands between 500 and 650 nm, which can be complementary to that of P3HT. Both P3HT:SA-53-E and P3HT:SA-54-E NFOSCs showed photo-response spectra similar to the absorption spectra, indicating the contribution from both the donor and the acceptor. The EQE of P3HT:SA-54-E cell extended over 700 nm and gave a high PCE of 3.17% compared to 1.20% of the P3HT:SA-53-E cell (Table 7). Both Vocs of these devices are up to 1.1 V, which can be attributed to the large difference between the HOMO of P3HT and the LUMO of the acceptors. When thiophene was substituted by thiophene-2-carbonitrile as the end group in SA-55-E (Fig. 11), the film absorption extended to 800 nm with an Eg of 1.64 eV. The down-shift LUMO level of the acceptor is beneficial to achieve a Jsc of 6.25 mA cm−2, but resulting in a low Voc of 0.97 V. As a result, the P3HT:SA-55-E cell provided a PCE of 2.37%.
In silole, the σ*-orbital of the silicon–carbon bond can effectively interact with the π*-orbital of the butadiene fragment endowing it with a conjugated system and electron-transporting properties. The silicon substitution in dibenzosilole (DBS) has little impact on the whole co-planarity. Lin et al. developed a DBS-cored T-DPP-T end capped small molecule acceptor SA-56-E (Fig. 11).132 Another fluorene analogue carbazole was also used to construct SA-57-E.133 Both small molecules displayed band gaps over 1.8 eV and can work well with P3HT. While the SA-56-E based device gave a moderate PCE of 2.05% with Jsc = 4.91 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.97 V and FF = 0.43, the SA-57-E gave a PCE of 2.30% with Jsc = 3.16 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.17 V and FF = 0.62 (Table 7). Apart from the conspicuous Voc for the device based on SA-57-E, the FF is almost the highest among NFOSCs based on DPP-based small molecule acceptors.


5.2.6 Spiro cores of SF/SCPDT/bifluorenylidene. 
The spiro structure with a highly twisted framework can effectively suppress strong intermolecular aggregation. Wu and co-workers designed a series of spirobifluorene (SF) cored small molecules of SA-58-E to SA-60-E with T-DPP-T as end groups, and SA-61-E to SA-63-E with the A–T-DPP-T end where A represents the CC triple bond (Fig. 11).134 The sp3-hybridized C-bridge in the SF center can block the electron transfer between the intramolecular DPP-fluorene-DPP substructure, resulting in the spiro-molecule as a dimer of the DPP–fluorene–DPP building block. When blended with P3HT, the SA-58-E based device gave the highest PCE of 3.63%, higher than that of 1.87% for SA-59-E and 1.42% for SA-60-E (Table 7). This should be attributed to the longer chains reducing the crystallinity. Compared to SA-54-E with the mono DPP–fluorene–DPP structure, the SA-58-E based blend showed a smaller domain size of 20–30 nm. When the conjugation backbone of SA-58-E was extended with trifluorobenzene, benzothiophene and benzofuran as capping groups, three new SF cored small molecules SA-64-E to SA-66-E (Fig. 11) were obtained.135 Although with reduced band gaps and displaying photocurrent from a longer wavelength, these acceptors provided relatively low PCEs even using PFN as the hole transport layer.
Li et al. reported an analogue SF molecule SA-67-E with phenyl groups capping on each thiophene end (Fig. 11).136 In comparison with that of SA-58-E, the SA-67-E based device gave a high PCE of 5.16% with Jsc = 8.29 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.14 V and FF = 0.55 (Table 7). Moreover, greatly improved stability was observed for the P3HT:SA-67-E blended device, with no PCE decay upon TA at 150 °C for 3 h.
The SF-cored small molecules SA-68-E to SA-70-E (Fig. 11) with varied numbers of T-DPP-T arms were synthesized by Sun and co-workers.137 The absorption spectra of the acceptor films are almost identical. PTB7-Th blended with the three acceptors exhibited the same Voc of 0.74 V. The device based on SA-70-E with four DPP-arms gave a higher PCE of 3.85%, which was mainly attributed to the high Jsc of 10.71 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.487 (Table 7). SCLC measurement revealed that the SA-70-E based blend showed higher and more balanced hole and electron mobilities. For another case of spirobicyclopentadithiophene (SCPDT) cored SA-71-E (Fig. 11), the device based on PTB7-Th and SA-71-E provided a maximum PCE of 4.20%. Compared to SA-70-E, SA-71-E displayed broader and complementary absorption to PTB7-Th, so the resulting device gave an improved Jsc of 11.69 mA cm−2 (Table 7).128
There is also a quasi-spiro-molecule SA-72-E (Fig. 11) which has a bifluorenylidene core.138 Different from the sp3-hybridized carbon atom observed in other typical spirobifluorene structures, a CC double bond between two fluorene substructures was used. The central bifluorenylidene core is too bulky to locate in one plane resulting in a significant torsion angle. This highly twisted structure is quite similar to that of SBF, which is expected to reduce the aggregation of the acceptor. The P3HT:SA-72-E NFOSCs had a PCE of up to 5.42%. Compared to that of the SA-58-E based device, the high Voc of 1.17 V based on SA-72-E is not sacrificed by the narrower optical band gap. Meanwhile, the Jsc and FF increased to 7.74 mA cm−2 and 0.60 respectively.


5.2.7 Fused aromatic cores of IDT. 
Fused aromatic ring cored small molecules are one of the most successful non-fullerene acceptor materials. However, to the best of our knowledge, only one fused ring indacenodithiophene (IDT) cored DPP end-capped molecular acceptor SA-73-E (Fig. 11) has been reported to date.139 The Frontier energy levels of SA-73-E show that it can act as both an electron donor blended with PCBM and an electron acceptor blended with P3HT. The devices based on SA-73-E:PCBM and P3HT:SA-73-E gave optimal PCEs of 2.82% and 0.83% respectively. The low device performance in these cells is mainly due to the non-ideal film morphology, as revealed by AFM with aggregated domains.

5.3 Summary
In this section, we have discussed the development of DPP-based small molecule acceptors for NFOSCs. There are so many DPP-based small molecules developed for electron acceptors, and the PCEs could also achieve about 9%. In addition, the NIR characteristics and high electron mobilities enable DPP-based small molecules to perfectly match well with P3HT to make NFOSCs. However, we also note that P3HT:DPP-based small molecules still cannot provide satisfactory performance, although some of them can have very high Vocs. We think that, due to the advantages of absorption spectra and electron mobility, it will be important to use DPP-based small molecules as electron acceptors to work with other polymer donors, such as donor–acceptor conjugated polymers, in order to obtain high photovoltaic performance. For this purpose, it is necessary to find an efficient way to lower the Frontier energy levels of these DPP-based small molecule acceptors.
6. Conclusion and outlook
In conclusion, we have provided an overview about DPP-based conjugated materials, including small molecules and conjugated polymers, both acting as the electron donor and acceptor for application in NFOSCs. These DPP-based conjugated materials are usually designed with DPP as the core alternated with electron-donating or electron-deficient units, in order to tune the absorption, energy levels and charge transport properties, so that they can be used as electron donors or electron acceptors. Among the vast amount of DPP-based conjugated materials, PCEs based on DPP-based small molecule donors could reach over 12% with a fused ring electron acceptor, which also represents the highest PCE in non-fullerene small molecule OSCs. This great achievement also indicates their potential application in NFOSCs. However, we also note that DPP-based conjugated polymers, both as the electron donor and acceptor, show disappointing performance in NFOSCs, although DPP-polymer donors ever play important roles in fullerene-based OSCs.
In OSCs, Jsc, Voc and FF are the three parameters to determine the PCEs, in which Jsc could be related to EQE spectra and Voc could be related to energy loss (as Eloss = Eg − eVoc). The relation between EQE and Eloss can clearly give us insight about the quality of OSCs. As shown in Fig. 12, while ITIC and PCBM-based OSCs can provide EQE over 60% with Eloss close to 0.60 eV, most of the NFOSCs with DPP-based donors or DPP-based acceptors show low EQE even at high Eloss.9,10,19,140–152 This will cause low photocurrent and meanwhile low Voc in solar cells. In addition, we can also note that most of the DPP-based NFOSCs provide a low FF below 0.60, while many high performance NFOSCs based on ITIC and its derivatives can achieve FFs over 0.70. This can explain the low PCEs in DPP-based NFOSCs.

The unstatisfactory PCEs of the DPP-based NFOSCs might be attributed to the following reasons: (1) the DPP core has a strong aggregation tendency, which may cause severe phase separation issues in blended thin films. This can be observed in DPP-polymer donors with non-fullerene acceptors. The large domain sizes in these blended thin films will lower the exciton diffusion into the interface of the donor and acceptor. (2) It is interesting to note that DPP-based conjugated materials act as electron acceptors, and most NFOSCs used P3HT as the electron donor. Although P3HT has easy synthesis, it also showed strong crystallinity, narrow absorption and limited structures. (3) An interesting theoretical study by Yi's group revealed that the molecular Frontier orbitals (including HOMO and LUMO levels) of the DPP unit are excessively delocalized, resulting in a strong intramolecular π–π* interaction and leading to inefficient exciton dissociation and serious charge recombination.153
From the above points of view, studies about DPP-based NFOSCs could focus on the following parts: (1) finding out a way to balance the charge transport and crystallinity of DPP-based conjugated materials. The crystallinity of these materials should be reduced in order to lower the aggregation tendency, but meanwhile the charge transport properties should be maintained. (2) Applying other conjugated polymers, especially the widely used donor–acceptor conjugated polymers as electron donors to work with DPP-based electron acceptors. For this purpose, the rational design of DPP-based conjugated materials, particularly concerning the energy levels and absorption, is highly desired. (3) It seems to be important to control the localization of Frontier energy levels on the conjugated backbone from theoretical calculations. From this aspect, some strong electron-donating groups should be introduced, such as porphyrin, to compete with the DPP-core.
In summary, DPP-based conjugated materials have several advantages, such as simple synthesis, NIR absorption spectra, high hole and electron mobilities, and high crystallinity and stability.154 All these merits make them promising for application in OSCs. With judicious material design and device fabrication, particularly combined with high performance conjugated polymer donors and non-fullerene acceptors, DPP-based conjugated materials will prove their significant role in realizing high performance organic solar cells.
