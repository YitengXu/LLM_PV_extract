    , Accepted 26th May 2020First published on 27th May 2020AbstractNickel-doped FeS2/rGO composites were synthesized as multifunctional materials via a facile hydrothermal method. The synthesized materials were characterized with XRD, FESEM, XPS, and TEM-SAED for structural, morphological and chemical studies. To study their electrochemical properties, all the synthesized composites were subjected to cyclic voltammetry tests. The optimum composite revealed high catalytic activity with high peak current density, limiting current, and efficiency of 7.60% for DSSC, which surpassed that of a platinum-based counter electrode (6.69%). The efficiency of the DSSC was significantly supported by interfacial studies and electron lifetime studies, and it exhibited lower charge transfer resistance and higher electron lifetime, respectively. Moreover, the fabricated DSSCs with high efficiency were subjected to transient photo-response studies and showed a stable current response with multiple photo-ON and OFF cycles for a period of 600 s. To broaden the application of the synthesized material, it was used as an electrochemical sensor for the efficient sensing of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The sensing electrode was modified with the optimum Ni-doped FeS2/rGO composite, and voltammetric detection was carried out in the hydrogen peroxide concentration range of 4–100 μM. Thus, the synthesized material can be applied in DSSCs and as an electrochemical H2O2 sensor.
1. Introduction
Green and clean energy is receiving increasing attention due to the depletion of fossil fuels. In this context, the sun is an abundant source of energy that is considered to be the most efficient amongst the available energy sources. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are third generation solar cells, which demonstrate more than 13% solar to power conversion efficiency upon modification with a co-photosensitization layer.1 DSSCs are considered to be low cost, friendly to the environment and easier to fabricate in comparison to conventional silicon-based solar cells.2 Traditional DSSCs comprise a dye-sensitized photo-anode, electrolyte and platinum-based counter electrode, in which the role of the counter electrode is significant in reducing the tri-iodide species to iodide species by collecting electrons from an external circuit.3 Traditional DSSCs use a platinum counter electrode to collect electrons from the external circuit because platinum has high catalytic activity and electrical conductivity. However, its practical application is limited by its scarcity and cost.4 Hence, it is necessary to find efficient alternatives to replace platinum-based counter electrodes.
On the other hand, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) plays significant roles in several industries, including pharmaceuticals, food, biological analysis and environmental chemistry. Despite the importance of H2O2 in industries, it is highly hazardous to biological systems because it is generated from the enzymatic reaction of aerobic respiration. The accumulation of excess H2O2 may lead to oxidative stress-induced diseases.5 Hence, the detection of H2O2 is necessary and is carried out by electrochemical processes due to their convenient rapid response, simple equipment and low operative cost.6
In the past two decades, many alternative materials have been used as counter electrodes, such as conducting polymers,7 carbon-based compounds,8 transition metal nitrides, carbides, oxides, selenides, and sulfides.9 Amongst the alternatives mentioned above, transition metal sulfides are promising candidates to replace platinum. Transition metal sulfides such as NiS, CoS, and MoS2 afford good catalytic performance.10–13 FeS2 has merits such as abundance in nature, high adsorption co-efficient, good electrocatalytic properties and non-toxicity,14 and it revealed an acceptable power conversion efficiency of above 5% in its first usage in a counter electrode prepared by Wang et al.15 Another process that involved preparing high purity FeS2 carried out via spray pyrolysis was proposed by Shukla et al.; the counter-electrode exhibited an efficiency of 8% in iodine-based liquid electrolyte.16 Song et al. synthesized high purity FeS2 using a hydrothermal process with an efficiency of 5.78%.17 This information indicates that FeS2 is a promising material for replacing platinum-based counter electrodes, with excellent electro-catalytic activity and low cost. Similarly, transition metal sulfides such as CuS,18 MoS2,19 and NiS20 have demonstrated potential in electrochemical sensors by their rapid response and are also considered to be low cost materials compared to noble metals.
In order to enhance the number of active sites on a material, graphene-based materials with two dimensions, high conductivity, and excellent electrochemical properties are a good option.21,22 Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as a support material on the catalyst surface confers the advantage of heterogeneous catalysis with minimized agglomeration of particles; this leads to an increase in the number of catalytically active surface sites. Hence, in this study, rGO was used as a supporting material to target the hybrid composites.23 In comparison to other reactions, the hydrothermal reaction is facile, with smooth operation, and produces various structures via controlled reaction parameters. Zhou et al. reported that a nanowhisker/FeS2@rGO composite can be used as a counter electrode material to enhance the active sites on the material, which exhibited a power conversion efficiency above 7%.24 Moreover, rGO has an excellent electron transfer rate, bio-compatibility and environmental stability; it has been used as a support catalyst for developing hybrids with inorganics.25,26 Many results have been reported of integrating graphene hybrids, which provide assimilated electro-active species for the substrate to react with via absorption. These numerous benefits of developing hybrids with inorganics enable the construction of efficient electrochemical sensors.
Doping is a strategy that is used to enhance the activity of catalyst materials; it regulates their intrinsic properties via incorporation of atoms or ions into the host lattice, yielding hybrid materials.27 Nickel-based transition metal compounds exhibit excellent catalytic activity, with efficient performance in reducing tri-iodide.28,29 Hence, in this study, Ni was selected to dope into FeS2. Further, to prepare a composite with carbonaceous materials in combination with doping, the synthesis is usually carried out either in two steps or by a solvothermal method using several chemicals. Similar to the present work, some previous studies, such as Co-doped FeS2/CNT,30 NiCo2S4/rGO,31 and CoMoS4-sulfur doped carbon,32 used two-step methods to prepare carbonaceous composites. Therefore, in the present study, Ni-FeS2/rGO composite material was prepared via a one-step hydrothermal process. The morphology of the synthesized material showed a sphere shape with a rough and porous surface, which aids efficient reduction of tri-iodide. Then, the prepared Ni-FeS2/rGO-based composites were coated on pre-cleaned fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) as counter electrodes. To assess the performance of the Ni-FeS2/rGO-based composites, electro-catalytic activity and electrochemical characterization studies were conducted and compared with platinum to demonstrate the enhancement of the properties of the synthesized material. Depending on the optimized conditions of the electro-chemical properties, the application of the synthesized materials was expanded to the field of electrochemical hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) sensors. In the application study, the electrochemical sensor delivered efficient response in the range of 4–100 μM. The newly developed electrodes delivered more efficient sensing properties compared with previous reports. This unique composite can be used as an efficient counter electrode for DSSCs and as an electrochemical hydrogen peroxide sensor.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Hydrothermal synthesis of Ni-FeS2/rGO
Graphene oxide (GO) was prepared using the Hummers method as reported previously.33 1 mg mL−1 of GO was dispersed in 80 mL DI water. 2 mmol of ferrous sulfate heptahydrate, 8 mmol of sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate and various amounts of nickel nitrate hexahydrate (0.1, 0.2 or 0.3 mmol) were dissolved in the dispersed GO solution by stirring for 30 min. Then, the mixture solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave and placed inside a muffle furnace at a temperature of 200 °C for 24 h. After completion of the reaction, the autoclave was naturally cooled to room temperature, and the precipitate was washed with hot distilled water and ethanol several times and dried at 80 °C for 12 h. Finally, the Ni-FeS2/rGO composite was obtained. Similarly, FeS2/rGO material was synthesized without addition of Ni ions and named FG. The synthesized counter anode materials with 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 mmol Ni doped into FeS2/rGO are named NFG-1, NFG-2 and NFG-3, accordingly, throughout the manuscript.
2.2. Material characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/Max-II) was carried out to analyze the crystallinity and phase purity of the synthesized materials. Field emission scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (FESEM, JEOL JSM-7000F) was used to obtain morphological images. Transmission electron microscopy equipped with selected area electron diffraction (TEM-SAED, JEOL JEM-3010) was performed to analyze the particle sizes and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; VGS Thermo K-Alpha) was performed with Al Kα radiation as the excitation source to determine the chemical compositions and oxidation states of the materials. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of the samples dispersed in solid KBr to form transparent pellets was performed with a PerkinElmer Spectrum instrument. The phases and other structural properties of the synthesized composites were further characterized by a micro-Raman spectrometer (Renishaw) using an excitation wavelength of 532 nm.
2.3. Preparation of counter electrodes and their electrochemical tests
A Ni-FeS2/rGO-based composite slurry was prepared by dissolving a mixture of synthesized catalyst and 5 wt% polyvinyl diene fluoride in N-methylpyrrolidone with a weight ratio of 9:1. Then, the slurry was mortared for another 1 h to obtain a homogeneous mixture. Finally, the slurry was coated on a fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass substrate by the doctor blade technique with the thickness of scotch tape, and the prepared electrodes were dried at 100 °C for 12 h in an oven in air. A platinum counter electrode was prepared for comparative study by thermal decomposition of 5 mM chloroplatinic acid dissolved in isopropanol; 2 drops of the solution were dropped over a pre-cleaned FTO substrate and sintered at 450 °C for 1 h.
The electrochemical properties of the Ni-FeS2/rGO-based composites were analyzed in a three-electrode system electrochemical cell with electrolyte containing 10 mM LiI, 1 mM I2 and 100 mM LiClO4 dissolved in acetonitrile. The three-electrode setup consisted of Ni-FeS2/rGO-coated substrate as the working electrode, platinum as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode; then, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted. The multiple scan of CV was set at 25 mV s−1, and the differential scan rate varied from 20 mV s−1 to 100 mV s−1. Similarly, symmetric cells were fabricated to carry out Tafel analysis in the iodide-based electrolyte.
2.4. Fabrication of DSSCs and their performance
The photo-anode was prepared as per previous work.34 The paste was prepared by dispersing TiO2 in a mixture solution of ethyl cellulose and alpha-terpinol in ethanol and acetic acid. The mixture solution was stirred for 24 h. The mixture solution was mortared for 1 h and deposited over pre-cleaned FTO substrate with an active area of 0.25 cm2. The TiO2 deposited electrodes was sintered at 450 °C for 1 h. The coated substrates were dipped for 24 h in a dye solution containing 3 mM N719 dye dissolved in ethanol. Finally, the dye-deposited TiO2-based photo-anodes were rinsed with ethanol to remove unabsorbed dye particles. The cells were fabricated with electrodes placed face to face, and Surlyn was used as a spacer. Finally, the cells were sealed, and commercial electrolyte EL-200 was injected via a hole drilled in the counter electrode. DSSCs were fabricated with photo-anodes with 0.25 cm2 active areas, and the current–voltage (IV) curves were recorded under a laboratory solar simulator with a light illumination of 100 mW cm−2; simultaneously, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded in a frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz with a bias voltage of 0.8 V. All the electrochemical studies were carried out using a CH Instruments 660 electrochemical workstation.
2.5. Preparation of electrodes for electrochemical H2O2 sensing performance
10 mg of the synthesized material was dispersed in a solution mixture containing 5 wt% Nafion in 35 μL ethanol and 150 μL DI water. The dispersion was carried out via ultrasonication for a duration of 30 min. Then, 20 μL of the dispersed solution was dropped over pre-cleaned nickel foam and air dried to obtain the electrode. Cyclic voltammetry analysis was carried out in an electrochemical cell containing Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, platinum wire as the counter electrode and prepared modified nickel foam as the working electrode. The electrolyte used was 0.1 M NaOH + 3 mM H2O2, and the scan rate was set to 25 mV s−1. Simultaneously, EIS was recorded in the range from 1 MHz to 0.1 mHz to obtain the Nyquist plot. To obtain the sensor parameters, voltammetric analysis was carried out in the concentration range of 4–100 μM H2O2.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis process
The preparation process of the NFG-based composite is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. The synthesized GO sheets were negatively charged are due to surface ionized carboxyl and hydroxyl groups.35 These GO sheets were dispersed in distilled water via sonication. Then, the precursors with Fe, Ni and S ions were added to the GO-containing solution; electrostatic attractions occurred between the metal ions (Fe and Ni ions) and GO sheets, leading to adsorption of the metal ions on the surface of GO. In the hydrothermal process, in the mixed solution under high temperature and pressure, the sulfur source (Na2S2O3·5H2O) nucleated with the metal ions to form Ni-doped FeS2. Simultaneously, GO was reduced to rGO sheets, leading to the formation of Ni-FeS2 wrapped in rGO sheets. Finally, the NFG-based precipitates were washed with hot water to remove excess sulfur ions and dried in an oven.

3.2. X-ray diffraction
The XRD pattern of the synthesized graphene oxide is shown in Fig. S1.† The NFG-based composites were synthesized via a hydrothermal process, where metal ions adsorbed on the surface of the GO sheets in mixed solution due to their opposite charges and were sulfurized under high temperature and pressure. Simultaneously, GO was reduced to rGO, and the Ni-doped FeS2/rGO composite was produced. The phase purities and crystal structures of the synthesized materials were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, and the resulting patterns are shown in Fig. 2(a). The synthesized composites match with JCPDS card no 42-1340, indicating the pyrite FeS2 structure. For the X-ray patterns, 2θ = 28.14°, 33°, 37.1°, 40.8°, 47.5°, 56.3°, 58.68°, 61.5° and 64° correspond to the (111), (200), (210), (211), (221), (311), (222), (230) and (321) reflection planes, respectively. In the obtained patterns, NFG-2 is pure pyrite, whereas NFG-1 and NFG-3 are pyrite-marcasite polymorphs (mentioned in Fig. 2a); this is due to the differences in charge between rGO and the metal precursors used. The crystal structure of FeS2, shown in Fig. 2(b), indicates the pyrite crystal structure of FeS2 with the space group Pa3. Every cell unit contains four formula units (FeS2); in the crystal structure, Fe ions occupy the sites of the face centered cubic sub-lattice, and the S22− dimers centered at the midpoints of the cube edges and structure with the body center can be considered NaCl-like. The crystal (S2)2− axis dimers are oriented along the [111] direction, and six sulfurs are coordinated with each Fe atom in a slight distorted-octahedron structure.36 In this study, some Fe ion sites were replaced by Ni ion, and the amount of Ni ion substituted depended on how many mmol of Ni were doped into FeS2. Further, FTIR was used to characterize and determine the functional groups and bonds present in the NFG-2 composite, as shown in Fig. S2(a).† The band centered at 3385 cm−1 is due to the –OH stretching vibration, and the peaks located at 1639, 1223 and 1073 cm−1 are attributed to sp2 hybridized CO groups, C–OH, and C–O stretching, respectively. The appearance of these peaks confirms the reduction of GO.37 As FeS2 is incorporated during the hydrothermal reaction, the peak at 1136 cm−1 is related to the FeS group, and the peaks in the range of 583–630 cm−1 are attributed to stretching of S–S and Fe–S bonds.38 For a hybrid composite with a carbonaceous material, Raman spectroscopy is an effective tool to provide some characterizations, such as phase and chemical structure. In Fig. S2(b),† the Raman spectrum reveals the D and G bands of the exfoliated few-layer graphene at 1330 and 1575 cm−1, respectively. As reported in previous papers, the ID/IG ratio lies between 0.16 to 0.50, indicating few-layer graphene.39 In the present report, ID/IG was calculated to be 0.47. Moreover, FeS2 microcrystals were observed at 330, 385, and 405 cm−1, respectively. These characteristic peaks of the active modes of bulk pyrite correspond to the vibration of S2 (Eg), phase stretch of S–S (Ag), and coupled vibration and stretch (Tg(3)) modes, respectively.

3.3. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
XPS was used to detect the electronic structure and surface composition of the NFG-2 composite. The survey spectrum of the Ni-FeS2/rGO composite is revealed in Fig. 3(a), where C 1s, O 1s, Fe 2p, Ni 2p and S 2p peaks are observed. Fig. 3(b) exhibits the core spectrum of Fe 2p with two peaks, in which the orbital binding energies of Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 are observed at 713.58 eV and 726.73 eV, respectively. In the S spectrum, as shown in Fig. 3(c), the observed peaks at 163.33 and 164.68 eV can be attributed to S 2p3/2 and S 2p3/2, respectively. Mainly, the peak at 169.13 eV is attributed to SO42− 2p1/2. The core spectra of Ni 2p, as revealed in Fig. 3(d), show a Ni 2p3/2 peak located at 856.88 eV with the Ni 2p3/2 satellite peak at 861.73 eV and a Ni 2p1/2 peak located at 874.83 eV with the satellite peak at 879.58 eV. These results confirmed that Ni and FeS2 are both mainly present. The core spectrum of C, as shown in Fig. 3(e), exhibits the existence of carbon in double bonds observed at 284.43 eV corresponding to CC; the other peaks observed at 285.78, 286.83, and 288.38 eV are related to C–C, C–O and O–CO, respectively. The presence of oxygen in the rGO was analyzed by the core spectrum of O, as shown in Fig. 3(f), revealing two peaks at 532.03 and 533.53 eV; these peaks can be attributed to CO and C–O, respectively.40 According to the XPS analysis, the NiFeS2/rGO composite was successfully and easily synthesized by a one-pot hydrothermal process.

3.4. Scanning electron microscopy
The morphology and microstructures of the NFG-2 composite, shown in Fig. 4(a), exhibit that the NFG-2 composite is uniformly spread out and that the Ni-FeS2 particles were well wrapped in rGO sheets after the hydrothermal process. This specific structure provides a significantly enhanced path for electron migration and facilitates electron transfer on the surface of the Ni-FeS2/rGO composite. The SEM images of NFG-2 shown in Fig. S3(a) and (b)† with different magnifications indicate a rough surface. Finally, the integral conductive rGO networks provide electron transport pathways, which ensures their high electrocatalytic activity.41Fig. 4(b) shows the EDS spectrum (selected area for EDS as displayed in Fig. S4† with elemental mapping) of the NFG-2 composite, where the elemental composition weight percentages of C, O, S, Fe and Ni were found to be 47.78%, 6.61%, 24.29%, 19.61%, and 1.72%, respectively (atomic% are shown in Table S1†). These percentages are in good accordance with the ratios of the stoichiometry of the synthesized composites. Further analysis of the elemental mapping of the NFG-2 composite is shown in Fig. S4.† The TEM image of the NFG-2 composite shown in Fig. 4(c) shows that Ni-FeS2 is wrapped in transparent rGO sheets. The selective area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern in Fig. 4(d) reveals a ring pattern in which (2 0 0), (2 1 1) and (4 4 2) planes are observed with d-spacings of 2.77, 2.24 and 0.90 Å, respectively. This obtained d-spacing is in good accordance with the JCPDS card mentioned earlier.

3.5. Electrochemical properties of the NFG-based composites
Electrochemical characterization is carried out to obtain valuable information about the energy levels of components, the reversibility of electrochemical reactions and the kinetics of electrochemical processes. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis in an electrochemical cell is a crucial tool to study the electrochemical properties of a material.42 The CV output is responsible for three combined effects, namely polarization, diffusion and electron rate transfer.41 In DSSCs, the iodide/triiodide couple is often used as a redox mediator in liquid electrolytes. The reaction occurring in the electrochemical cell is as follows. Ox1, 3I− − 2e− = I3−(1) Ox2, 2I3− − 2e− = 3I2(2) Red1, I3− + 2e− = 3I−(3) Red2, 3I2 + 2e− = 2I3−(4)
The CV plot exhibits two pairs of reduction and oxidation peaks. The two oxidation peaks correspond to eqn (1) and (2), and the two reduction peaks correspond to eqn (3) and (4). The reduction peaks (Red1 and Red2) indicate the redox reaction of I2/I3−.43 From the CV, upon oxidation, a pair of peak current densities is produced in which Ox1 is considered for electrochemical property calculations; their values are summarized in Table 1. The peak current density of NFG-2 was as high as 2.75 mA cm−2, and the other composites, such as FG, NFG-1, NFG-3 and platinum electrodes, exhibited peak current densities of 1.70, 1.85, 1.65, and 2.02 mA cm−2, respectively. From the cyclic voltammetry analysis, another crucial electrochemical property is the peak-to-peak-separation potential (ΔEapp) of the material, which significantly relates to the electrocatalytic activity. The redox peak-to-peak separation potential (ΔEapp) value negatively correlates with the electrocatalytic activity; Nicholson proposed a theory in the mid-1960s44 that a smaller ΔEapp value is obtained at a higher current density, and the electro-catalytic conversion rate of I3−/I− is inversely proportional to the ΔEapp value.45–47 Accordingly, NFG-2 displayed a small ΔEapp value of 0.31 V, whereas the other electrodes, such as platinum, FG, NFG-1 and NFG-3, displayed ΔEapp values of 0.34 V, 0.35 V, 0.33 V and 0.34 V, respectively. Hence, NFG-2 electrodes with smaller ΔEapp values achieved higher peak current densities in the cyclic analysis. In the complex electrochemical process, the potential scan rate determines the peak current density, and the electron transfer on the surface is due to the diffusion of measured species of the electrode. The peak current density is proportional to the scan rate; hence, it is vital to determine the diffusion coefficient, which originates from the surface of the counter electrode and is calculated by the Randles–Sevcik equation as follows:48 Jred = Kn1.5AC(Dn)0.5V0.5(5)where Jred is the peak current density, K is the constant (2.69 × 10−5), n is the number of electrodes involved in the charge transfer, Dn is the diffusion coefficient, C is the iodide concentration, A is the area of the counter electrode, and V is the potential scan rate. From the equation, the diffusion coefficient value of the NFG-2 electrode is 7.23 × 10−5 cm−2 s−1, whereas the other composites exhibited lower diffusion coefficient values than NFG-2. These values are ranked in the order of NFG-2 > Pt > NFG-1 > FG > NFG-3.

The electrochemical performance of electrodes can be probed via assembling a symmetric cell without a TiO2 photo-anode. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the Tafel plot can be distinguished by three different zones of overpotential, namely the polarization zone at low overpotential, the Tafel zone at middle overpotential, and the diffusion zone at high overpotential.49 The diffusion zone of the Tafel plot shows the limiting current density (Jlim), which is closely related to the electro-catalytic activity of a material. An electrode with higher current density possesses faster diffusion velocity and lower charge transfer resistance simultaneously.50 Based on the CV and Tafel polarization measurements, it can be concluded that NFG-2 exhibits excellent electro-catalytic activity for tri-iodide regeneration, with the highest Jlim value of 0.82 mA cm−2. The order of the Jlim values was ranked as follows: NFG-2 > Pt > NFG-1 > FG > NFG-3. The excellent electrochemical properties of the NFG-2 electrode were achieved by doping an appropriate amount of nickel ions into FeS2, and the synergistic effects between the good electro-catalytic activity of Ni-FeS2 and rGO provided facile electron transport pathways for the redox reaction in iodine-based electrolyte. Furthermore, to study the chemical stability of the NFG-2 composite as a counter electrode, it was subjected to successive cyclic voltammetry for 50 cycles, as shown in Fig. 5(c), at a scan rate of 25 mV s−1. The redox peak current densities showed that the NFG-2 composite retained 91% capacity after the 50 cycle test. This result indicates that the redox peak current densities retained stable with increasing cycle number. The electrochemical cyclic curve was found to be unaltered after the stability test, which proves that the material coated on the surface of the electrode is tightly bound and that the redox reactions were stable even after prolonged contact with the liquid electrolyte.51

The successive differential scan rate of CV for the NFG-2 composite was studied; it is evident that the alteration in the peak current density proves the general electrocatalytically active behavior of the material. Fig. 5(d) shows CVs of the NFG-2 composite in the iodine-based electrolyte at various scan rates in the range of 20–100 mV s−1. The cathodic peaks of NFG-2 shift to the negative side and the anodic peaks shift to the positive side with increasing scan rate. The relationship of the shift in the current density with the scan rate, shown in Fig. S5,† demonstrates that the redox reaction fits with linearity between the values of the current density and scan rate due to the increased transport of iodide species on the surface with enhancement in the surface active sites.52 This suggests that the adsorption of iodide species significantly influences the surface of the materials.53 The abundant surface active sites are due to the pure pyrite wrapped in the rGO sheets. Based on its electrochemical properties, the significant results for the NFG-2 composite are attributed to the specific structure of Ni-doped FeS2 wrapped in rGO sheets. The abundant active surface sites facilitate electron transfer between rGO and Ni-FeS2. Furthermore, the 2D channels in the NFG-2 composite provide intimate surface contact with a higher interfacial contact area between the electrode and electrolyte, exhibiting a higher diffusion coefficient and acceleration of the electrochemical reaction rate. The superior electrochemical properties of the NFG-2 composite are due to the optimum amount of Ni ions doped into FeS2 and embedded in the rGO sheets. These specific advantages afford enhanced performance upon fabrication of DSSCs.
3.6. Photovoltaic performance of the fabricated DSSCs
The photovoltaic performance of the materials was studied in fabricated DSSCs under light illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5). The fabricated DSSCs contained NFG-based materials as the counter electrode and were compared with a DSSC containing a platinum counter electrode. Fig. 6(a) shows the current density–voltage plots of the fabricated DSSCs. NFG-2 as a counter electrode for DSSCs has a higher power conversion efficiency of 7.60% with a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 16.53 mA cm−2 and an open-circuit voltage (V) of 0.72 V. These achieved photovoltaic parameters are due to the optimum doping of the Ni ions and the addition of rGO, which provides facile electron pathways and more electrocatalytically active sites. This unique structure gives rise to enhanced photovoltaic parameters of the DSSCs. Further investigation of the photovoltaic performance was carried out via interfacial charge transfer resistance (Rct1) of CE/electrolyte and electron relaxation time (τ) studies.

The parameters of the interfacial resistance were determined by fitting the Nyquist plot, as shown in Fig. 6(b), using Zsimp software, and the equivalent circuit is shown in the inset. In the Nyquist plot, the real axis intercept is attributed to the series resistance and the first arc intercepted in the real axis is the charge transfer resistance (Rct1), which corresponds to the interfacial resistance of the CE/electrolyte. The second arc in the plot is the Rct2, which corresponds to the interfacial charge transfer between TiO2/dye/electrolyte, and the final arc is the transport of ions within the electrolyte. As per the results, the Rct1 values of NFG-2 are low in comparison to the other counter electrodes. The charge transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface is around 6.49 ohm cm−2, which is higher compared to those of the synthesized FG and Pt, which correspond to 9.00 ohm cm−2 and 15.80 ohm cm−2, respectively. NFG-2 with better electrocatalytic activity resulted in a decrease in the charge transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface. This charge transfer reduction was due to the higher conductivity of the material and the better-accelerated regeneration of I− from I3− ions. Also, the electron relaxation time was studied to elucidate the electron kinetic process in the circuit of the DSSCs. Usually, the electron relaxation lifetime is studied by the Bode plot, which is derived from impedance analysis, as shown in Fig. 6(c). The electron relaxation time (τ) was calculated using the equation τ = 1/2πfmax, where fmax is the maximum frequency. As per the studies, the electron relaxation time of the NFG-2 DSSC was found to be 2.80 ms; this is higher than those of the Pt and FG-based DSSCs, with electron relaxation time values of 1.08 and 0.59 ms, respectively. The higher electron relaxation time of the NFG-2-based DSSC is attributed to faster diffusion of electrons and slower charge recombination of electrons of I3− in the electrolyte.57 Additionally, the peak shifts towards a lower frequency range signify a longer electron relaxation time.58 To explore the photo-response of the fabricated NFG-2-based DSSC, chronoamperometry studies were carried out for 600 seconds with multiple ON and OFF cycles of irradiated light, and the J–t plot is displayed in Fig. 6(d). The results show stable current generation upon light irradiation, and the patterns were similar throughout multiple cycles. The stability of the photo-current response of the fabricated DSSC indicates charge-carrier recombination through the surface state.59 The sharp rise in current density is due to quick injection of the electrons from the dye to the conduction band of TiO2 and further regeneration of electrons from the redox reaction through the surface of CE.
3.7. Electrochemical hydrogen peroxide sensor
The electrodes for the H2O2 sensor were designed by drop casting the slurry over pre-cleaned nickel foam (NF) and were named NF/FG and NF/NFG-2 for FeS2/rGO and Ni-FeS2/rGO, respectively. The electrochemical properties were studied through cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis in a conventional three-electrode electrochemical cell. The prepared electrodes were subjected to CV tests in 0.1 M NaOH electrolyte, as shown in Fig. 7(a), and there was no significant peak presence without addition of H2O2. Upon addition of 3 mM H2O2 in 0.1 M NaOH electrolyte, as revealed in Fig. 7(b), the electrodes displayed a significant oxidized peak around 0.09 V against Ag/AgCl. Further analyzing the CV plots, bare NF had a peak current density of 0.09 mA cm−2, and the modified electrodes of NF/FG and NF/NFG-2 exhibited peak current densities of 0.71 and 1.60 mA cm−2, respectively. This cyclic phenomenon indicates that the electron transfer abilities of the prepared electrodes and NF/NFG-2 are more desirable than those of the other electrodes. NF/NFG-2 showed a significant enhancement in oxidation, which is due to the effects of doping and to some effects similar to those explained earlier when discussing the electro-chemical properties of the counter electrodes in section 3.5. As per previous reports, the mechanism for the detection of H2O2 can be proposed as follows and may require further investigation in the future:60 Ni-FeS2/rGO (ox) + e− ⇌ Ni-FeS2/rGO (red)(6) (7)

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies were carried out to obtain information on the interfacial properties of the electrode surface. The Nyquist plots of the different electrodes (NF, NF/FG and NF/NFG-2), depicted in Fig. 7(c), were analyzed in electrolyte solution containing 0.1 M NaOH + 3 mM H2O2 with the AC impedance technique in the frequency range from 1 MHz to 100 Hz, and the bias potential used was 0.1 V. In the Nyquist plot, the high frequency region with an arc is attributed to the electron transfer process, and the mid frequency region is related to the electron transfer resistance. Compared with the unmodified NF electrode, the electrode modified with FG exhibited resistance of 4.6 ohms, and that with the optimum composition of NFG-2 possessed comparably low resistance of 3.5 ohms. In conclusion, the total resistance was found to be in the order of NF/NFG-2 < NF/FG < NF. This provided a clear indication of the enhancement in the conductivity, and this factor can be effective in the sapplication of a material as an electrochemical sensor. The voltammetry plot provides clear information on the potential output of the electrochemical sensor. The impact of detection was investigated by the voltammetry response to successive increases of the H2O2 concentration in the electrolyte. Fig. 7(d) shows the voltammetry response of the NF/NFG-2 electrode towards continuous detection of H2O2 with successive concentration changes. From the detailed analysis, the newly developed electrochemical sensor exhibited rapid steady state response owing to its good electro-catalytic activity and the faster exchange of electrons from the surface. The NF/NFG-2 electrode delivered activity in the concentration range of 4–100 μM in H2O2 with a sensitivity of 21.24 μA μM−1, and it also exhibited a 0.5 μM detection limit; this was calculated using the formula of the limit of detection (LOD), LOD = 3Sb/S, where Sb is the signal standard deviation and S is the sensitivity. The signal standard deviation was obtained from the linear plot of concentration (μM) vs. current (mA), as shown in the inset of Fig. 7(d). A comparison of the performance of the present non-enzymatic H2O2 sensor with previously reported literature is shown in Table 3; it clearly indicates that the newly developed electrode, NF/NFG-2, exhibited superior performance compared with other reported sensors. With the abovementioned advantages in its electro-catalytic activities, NF/NFG-2 may be an ideal material for non-enzymatic H2O2 sensors.

4. Conclusion
In summary, Ni-doped FeS2/rGO composites were prepared via a facile hydrothermal method. The studies showed that NFG-2 exhibited good electro-catalytic performance, with a high diffusion co-efficient of 7.23 × 10−5 cm−2 s−1 and a higher limiting current density of 0.82 mA cm−2. To investigate the photovoltaic performance of the composites, DSSCs were fabricated using NFG-2 as a counter electrode. The photovoltaic studies exhibit that NFG-2 as a counter electrode for DSSCs possessed higher power conversion efficiency than platinum. Nyquist and Bode plots were obtained by electrochemical impedance spectroscopic studies. For the DSSC using NFG-2 as a counter electrode, its photovoltaic performance is as follows. The solar photovoltaic conversion efficiency is about 7.6%, with a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 16.53 mA cm−2 and an open circuit voltage of 0.72 V; the charge transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface is around 6.49 ohm cm2, and the electron relaxation time (τ) is about 2.80 ms. Based on these studies, the synthesized Ni-FeS2/rGO material could be an alternative counter electrode to replace costly platinum electrodes in DSSCs. Further, the optimized composite was selected for application as an electrochemical sensor for H2O2 detection; the newly developed NF/NFG-2 electrode delivered comparably efficient properties of 21.4 μA μM−1 sensitivity and 0.5 μM detection limit in a concentration range of 4–100 μM H2O2. A unique material that can be utilized for more than one specific application can further broaden the scope of newly developed materials for multiple applications.
