    , Accepted 30th May 2017First published on 30th May 2017AbstractSpatial separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs is one of the most important factors that determine the efficiency of a photocatalyst. It is well acknowledged that the fabrication of heterogeneous photocatalysts with two different inorganic semiconductors is a good strategy to effectively improve the charge separation of electrons and holes. This study describes a novel visible light-induced g-C3N4/Bi3TaO7 composite photocatalyst with superior photocatalytic properties toward the degradation of tetracycline (TC) by visible light irradiation. The formation of heterojunctions significantly improves the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers, which is confirmed by the photocurrent density and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Electron spin resonance examination and trapping experiments confirm that the photoinduced active species (˙OH and ˙O2−) are responsible for the degradation of tetracycline. Based on the experimental results, a possible Z-scheme system reaction mechanism for the g-C3N4/Bi3TaO7 composite towards the degradation of TC under visible light was proposed.
As an advanced catalytic oxidation technique, photocatalysis has attracted significant attention in recent years due to its potential application in water splitting, degradation of pollutants and CO2 conversion.1–3 Many studies on TiO2 were carried out since it was discovered that it could be used for the photochemical decomposition of water for H2 production.4–6 TiO2, as a typical photocatalyst, has been extensively applied in water treatment, gas purification, sterilization and self-cleaning materials owing to its chemical inertness and nontoxicity.7–10 However, its wide band gap only responds to UV light, which limits its further application in photocatalysis. Many efforts have been made to explore novel photocatalysts that respond to visible light. In recent years, some metal oxide photocatalysts, such as Fe2O3, Bi2O3 and Cu2O, have been given much attention due to their enhanced photocatalytic efficiency under visible light.11–13 Nonetheless, these photocatalysts exhibit poor stability in strong acid or alkaline conditions. Therefore, it is significantly important to explore novel photocatalysts that are resistant to acid or alkali for practical application.
It has been reported that Bi3TaO7 is an excellent photocatalyst to remove organic contaminants in wastewater.14 Due to its hybridized valence band comprised of Bi 6s and O 2p states, Bi3TaO7 could absorb visible light to decompose organic contaminants. Its dispersed valence band facilitates oxidation reactions because of the high mobility of photogenerated holes in it. In addition, a defect fluorite-type structure exists in Bi3TaO7 crystallites, which exhibits oxygen vacancies and disorder in both its anionic and cationic lattices.15,16 Compared with other metal oxide photocatalysts, Bi3TaO7 is resistant to corrosion in strong acid and alkaline conditions. Its satisfactory stability under harsh conditions makes its use possible for practical application. However, Bi3TaO7 suffers from a low separation of photogenerated carriers, which extensively limits its photocatalytic efficiency.
There have been many attempts by researcher to improve the quantum efficiency of TiO2. It is commonly believed that the fabrication of heterogeneous photocatalytic systems could reduce the recombination of photon-generated carriers, which is beneficial to enhance the utilization efficiency of solar energy.17,18 Very recently, Z-scheme heterojunctions have gained extensive attention. The consumption of photo-generated electrons and holes with a redox mediator significantly reduces the charge recombination in Z-scheme heterojunction systems, thus, their redox ability is stronger than other types of heterojunction and single component photocatalysts. Generally, the conduction band of one semiconductor should be close to the valence band of another semiconductor to form a Z-scheme system consisting of two types of semiconductors. Unfortunately, to date, only a limited amount of semiconductor photocatalysts are available for the construction of Z-scheme systems. Further work has to be performed to explore more semiconductors for the construction of Z-scheme photocatalytic systems.
Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has drawn ever increasing attention as a visible-light photocatalyst for water splitting and the degradation of organic pollutants in recent years.19–22 It is a metal-free polymeric semiconductor with a two-dimensional layered structure, which endows g-C3N4 with a high specific surface area. Moreover, as an important carbon material, g-C3N4 possesses a unique electronic band structure and good photochemical stability.23–26 However, the rapid recombination rate of photo-generated carriers impedes its photocatalytic activity. It is well known that the use of g-C3N4-based heterojunction composites is considered an efficient strategy to address this issue. Especially, various g-C3N4/semiconductor composite photocatalysts for Z-scheme photocatalytic systems have been reported due to the negative conduction band minimum and valence band maximum of g-C3N4, such as g-C3N4/WO3,27 g-C3N4/Ag3PO4,28 g-C3N4/BiVO4,29 g-C3N4/Bi2O3,30 g-C3N4/MoO3,31 g-C3N4/TiO2,32 g-C3N4/V2O5 and g-C3N4/Bi2WO633,34 composites. These composite photocatalysts exhibited enhanced photocatalytic performances as all-solid state Z-scheme photocatalysts.
To the best of our knowledge, to date, the coupling of g-C3N4 with Bi3TaO7 to fabricate a Z-scheme photocatalyst system with enhanced photocatalytic performance has not been reported in the literature. Considering the suitable band energies of g-C3N4 and Bi3TaO7, an efficient Z-scheme type g-C3N4/Bi3TaO7 photocatalyst system is fabricated to achieve effective separation of photogenerated charges. The photocatalytic performance of the as-prepared samples is investigated via the degradation of TC under visible light irradiation. The photocatalytic degradation rate (DR) of the composites is higher than bare Bi3TaO7 and g-C3N4. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the composites is ascribed to their optical absorption ability as well as enhanced photogenerated electron–hole pairs separation. Finally, an efficient Z-scheme photocatalytic reaction mechanism is proposed based on the results of the energy band positions, trapping experiments and ESR spectra. Thus, the novel g-C3N4/Bi3TaO7 Z-scheme photocatalyst may have potential applications in environmental purification.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of Bi3TaO7 nanoparticles
All reagents were analytical grade and used directly without further purification. Bi3TaO7 was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal route. In a typical procedure, 0.242 g of Bi (NO3)3·5H2O and 0.107 g of TaCl5 were added to 10 mL of ethanol and continuously stirred for 30 min to obtain a suspension. The pH value of the above suspension was adjusted to 10 using a KOH aqueous solution (7 M). The obtained precipitate was placed in a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and maintained at 220 °C for 24 h. The as-obtained yellow precipitate was washed with distilled water and ethanol alternately and subsequently dried in an oven at 60 °C overnight.
2.2 Synthesis of g-C3N4/Bi3TaO7 nanocomposites
The g-C3N4/Bi3TaO7 photocatalysts were prepared according to a literature procedure.35 As shown in Scheme 1, Bi3TaO7 and melamine powder with a certain mass ratio were added to a mortar and then ground for 30 min using a pestle. The mixed powder was added to a crucible, pressed and then heated to 520 °C in a muffle furnace for 4 h at a heating rate of 2.3 °C min−1 to produce the final g-C3N4/Bi3TaO7 composite photocatalysts. The amounts of g-C3N4 were 0, 10, 30, 50, 70, and 90% (weight percent), which are denoted as BTO, CB-1, CB-3, CB-5, CB-7, and CB-9, respectively. Pure g-C3N4 was prepared using the same method without the addition of Bi3TaO7.

2.3 Characterization of catalysts
The crystallinity and phase of g-C3N4/Bi3TaO7 were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer, Germany) using a CuKα radiation source (λ = 1.542 Å). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) images were taken with an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi). The morphology of the samples was examined via field-emission scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (Tecnai G2 FEI, Co.). UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were obtained on a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrometer with BaSO4 as a reference. Photoluminescence spectra (PL) were collected on a PerkinElmer LS 55 spectrophotometer at room temperature. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms at 77 K were obtained using a TriStar II 3020 surface area and porosity analyzer (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation, USA). The ESR signals of spin-trapped oxidative radicals were obtained on a Bruker ESR JES-FA200 spectrometer. Total organic carbon (TOC) analyses were conducted on a multi N/C 2100 (Analytik Jena AG, Germany) TOC analyzer.
2.4 Photocatalytic activity evaluation
Photocatalytic activities were evaluated toward the photodegradation of TC under visible light (λ > 420 nm) irradiation. In a typical process, 50 mg of catalyst powder was placed in an aqueous solution of TC (10 mg L−1). Prior to irradiation, the suspensions were stirred for 60 min in the dark to approach adsorption–desorption equilibrium between the photocatalysts and TC aqueous solution. The suspensions were then irradiated using a 300 W Xe lamp with a 420 nm cut-off filter while stirring. The energy intensity of visible light was determined to be 15.0 W m−2 using a CEL-NP2000 optical power densitometer. Solutions were collected at 15 min intervals and centrifuged to remove the catalyst, then analyzed according to their absorbance at 357 nm using a UV-vis spectrophotometer. The degradation rate (DR) was calculated using the following formula: DR(%) = (1 − C/C0) × 100%, where C is the concentration of TC at each irradiation time interval and C0 is the initial concentration.
2.5 Photoelectrochemical measurement
The working electrode was prepared via the spin coating method. Typically, 100 mg catalyst was dispersed in 3 mL ethanol, and then 10 mg of PVP and 30 μL of oleic acid were added. The suspension was stirred for 2 h then deposited on an FTO (effective area: 3 cm × 1.6 cm) substrate by spin coating. The prepared electrode was obtained after annealing at 500 °C for 2 hours in a muffle furnace. Photocurrent measurements were carried out using a conventional three electrode quartz cell with 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution and recorded using an electrochemical system connected to an electrochemical station (CHI 760E, Shanghai Chenhua, China). An Xe lamp with a cut-off filter (λ > 420 nm) was used as the visible light source. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in a three-electrode cell in the presence of 5 mM [Fe(CN)6]3−/[Fe(CN)6]4− solution with a CHI 760E workstation at room temperature.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Crystal structure and morphology
The XRD patterns of the as-prepared samples are shown in Fig. 1. The two characteristic peaks at 13.1° and 27.4° of the pure g-C3N4 sample (JCPDS card no. 87-1526) are observed, which correspond to the (100) and (002) crystal planes of the layered g-C3N4.36 For the Bi3TaO7 sample, the four major diffraction peaks in its XRD pattern can be indexed to cubic phase Bi3TaO7 (JCPDS card no. 44-0202). In the XRD patterns of the g-C3N4/Bi3TaO7 composites, there is no characteristic peak of g-C3N4 besides the peaks of Bi3TaO7 when the g-C3N4 content was below 30 wt%. A similar phenomenon was reported for g-C3N4 hybrids, where it is suggested that the absence of the diffraction peaks of g-C3N4 might be due to their low diffraction intensity.37 The XRD peak of g-C3N4 appeared gradually with an increase in its content from 30 wt% to 90 wt%. Thus, it can be concluded that the composites mainly consist of g-C3N4 and Bi3TaO7. In addition, the FTIR spectra of composites (Fig. S1†) also validate the existence of g-C3N4 and Bi3TaO7 and no impurities were found in the composites, which is further verified by the EDS spectra (Fig. S2†).

Fig. 2 depicts the FESEM, TEM and HRTEM images of the 50 wt% g-C3N4/Bi3TaO7 composite. It is observed that the aggregated edge of g-C3N4 displays two-dimensional (2D) lamellar structures and a number of nanoparticles are dispersed on the surfaces of g-C3N4. The TEM image (Fig. 2b) further verifies the morphology of composite. Bi3TaO7 nanoparticles are uniformly generated on the surface of g-C3N4 to form the g-C3N4/Bi3TaO7 heterojunction structure. The size of the Bi3TaO7 nanoparticles is in the range of 10–30 nm, which is confirmed by the TEM image (Fig. 3c). Moreover, the lattice spacings of 0.315 and 0.273 nm in the HRTEM image correspond to the (111), and (200) planes of Bi3TaO7, respectively (Fig. 2d). These results reveal that g-C3N4/Bi3TaO7 heterojunction photocatalysts were successfully prepared.

To further investigate the detailed structure and element distribution of the g-C3N4/Bi3TaO7 composite, the HAADF-STEM image of the 50 wt% g-C3N4/Bi3TaO7 sample was employed, as shown in Fig. 3, in which it is observed that there is a good spatial distribution corresponding to C, N, Bi, Ta and O elements. This result signifies the formation of the g-C3N4/Bi3TaO7 composite.
3.2 XPS analysis
The elemental compositions and chemical states of the 50 wt% g-C3N4/Bi3TaO7 composite were characterized via XPS, as shown in Fig. 4. All the peaks in the XPS curves of the composites are attributed to Bi, Ta, O, C and N. The two peaks at 159.1 and 164.5 eV correspond to Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2, respectively.38 The peaks at 28.8 and 27.5 eV are assigned to Ta 4f5/2 and the other peak at 25.9 eV can be attributed to Ta 4f7/2, which corresponds to the Ta5+ oxidation state.39,40 In Fig. 4d, the peak of O 1s at 529.9 eV is assigned to crystal lattice oxygen in the structure of Bi3TaO7, whereas the peaks at 531.2 and 532.6 eV are ascribed to surface hydroxyl groups and physically adsorbed oxygen, respectively.41 Three C 1s peaks located at 284.6, 286.6 and 288.1 eV are observed in Fig. 4e. The peak located at 284.78 eV is the calibration of C 1s, whereas the peaks at 286 and 288.2 eV are both derived from the sp2 hybridized C (C–N3) in the g-C3N4 lattice.42 Moreover, Fig. 4f presents the peaks of the N 1s spectra, which are divided into three peaks with binding energies at 398.6, 400, and 401.2 eV and attributed to the sp2-hybridized nitrogen (CN–C), tertiary nitrogen (N–(C3)), and effects of the charging reaction, respectively.43

3.3 UV-DRS characterization

Fig. 5 shows the diffused reflectance spectra of Bi3TaO7, g-C3N4 and the g-C3N4/Bi3TaO7 composites. It is observed that the absorption of pure Bi3TaO7 has photo-responses from the UV light region to the visible light region (200–430 nm). The bare g-C3N4 has a wavelength threshold at 473 nm. Obviously, the addition of g-C3N4 extends the light absorption spectral range of the g-C3N4/Bi3TaO7 composites to the visible region, which is beneficial for improving their photocatalytic performance. The optical band gap energy (Eg) of a semiconductor photocatalyst can be estimated using the Kubelka–Munk equation:44 αhv = A(hv − Eg)n/2(1)where, α, h, v, A and Eg represent the absorption coefficient, Planck constant, light frequency, proportionality and band gap energy, respectively. Among them, n is determined by the type of optical transition of the semiconductor (n = 1 for direct transition and n = 4 for indirect transition). Therefore, the band gap energy of g-C3N4 was estimated to be 2.62 eV, which is slightly lower than 2.7 eV.45 In addition, the calculated band gap of Bi3TaO7 was 2.84 eV.

3.4 N2 adsorption–desorption study
The specific surface area and porosity of the photocatalysts were also investigated. As shown in Fig. 6, the representative N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of pure Bi3TaO7, g-C3N4 and CB-5 composite are of type IV hysteresis loops, which indicates the presence of mesopores and macropores in these samples.46 In addition, the BET specific surface area of the CB-5 composite was calculated to be 172.5 m2 g−1, which is 2.9 times higher than that of bulk g-C3N4 (58.9 m2 g−1) and 2.3 times that of pristine Bi3TaO7 (75.4 m2 g−1). The higher specific surface area can provide more active sites for adsorption and surface reactions; meanwhile, a more porous structure is beneficial to promote the kinetics of the reaction by facilitating the diffusion of reactants and products.

3.5 Photocatalytic activity for TC degradation
The photocatalytic performance of the g-C3N4/Bi3TaO7 composite photocatalysts were determined by the degradation of TC (10 mg L−1) under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). It should be noted that the adsorption equilibrium between the photocatalysts and TC aqueous solution was achieved within 60 min (Fig. 7a). For comparison, Degussa P25 and a mechanical mixture of pure Bi3TaO7 and g-C3N4 (mass ratio was 5:5) were also evaluated under the same conditions, as shown in Fig. 7b. The CB-5 composite photocatalyst exhibited an enhanced photocatalytic activity in contrast to P25 and the mechanical mixture. In addition, the bare g-C3N4 and Bi3TaO7 also exhibited low performances towards the photocatalytic decomposition of TC. Among the samples, the CB-5 photocatalyst exhibited the most pronounced photocatalytic activity, which achieved a TC degradation rate of 89.2% within 90 min under visible light irradiation (Fig. 7c and d). This result verifies that the enhanced photocatalytic activity is mainly attributed to the synergetic effect between g-C3N4 and Bi3TaO7. Furthermore, the kinetic curves of the various samples are shown in Fig. 7e. It is found that the plots follow first order kinetics. Additionally, the degradation rate constants of TC are shown in Fig. 7f, where can be observed that the degradation rate constant of CB-5 is about 3 and 8 times higher than that of single BTO and g-C3N4, respectively.

To further demonstrate the photocatalytic properties of the photocatalysts, TOC analyses were conducted. As shown in Fig. 8, the removal rate of TOC (43.5%) was significantly lower than the degradation rate (89.2%) toward TC degradation within 90 min, which suggests that it is easier to destroy the organic group of TC rather than to mineralize it into CO2 and H2O. Many small intermediate products may be generated in the solution after the TC molecules were mineralized by the photocatalysts.47 It is noted that the TOC removal curves have a similar trend to the degradation rate curves, which demonstrates that our photo-degradation experiments successfully and correctly evaluated the photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared photocatalysts. Moreover, the reduced TOC removal rate indicates that the as-prepared g-C3N4/Bi3TaO7 composite photocatalysts might have potential for environmental applications.

3.6 Photocurrent and electrochemical impedance analysis
To further study the photoelectric response of the photocatalysts, transient photoresponse measurements were conducted under visible irradiation with several on–off cycles. Fig. 9a shows the I–t curves of BTO, g-C3N4 and CB-5 composite. BTO and g-C3N4 show a low photocurrent density under visible light irradiation. Nevertheless, the photocurrent (Iph) density of the samples exhibits the notable enhancement in the Iph of CB-5 over BTO and g-C3N4. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was further employed to illustrate the charge separation efficiency of the g-C3N4/Bi3TaO7 composite. It is found that the arc radius of CB-5 is obviously smaller than that of pristine g-C3N4 and BTO, which suggests the effective separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs over the g-C3N4/Bi3TaO7 composite (Fig. 9b).48 Moreover, photoluminescence (PL) was also used to explore the separation efficiency of photo-generated electrons and holes, as shown in Fig. S2.† Obviously, the emission intensity of CB-5 significantly decreased compared with that of the bare g-C3N4, Bi3TaO7 and other composites, which suggests that the g-C3N4/Bi3TaO7 composite has a stronger ability to separate charge carriers. Hence, these results confirm that electron–hole pairs could be separated effectively in the g-C3N4/Bi3TaO7 composite, and as a result, more reactive species are produced which promote the degradation of TC.

3.7 Trapping experiments
To detect the main active species responsible for the photocatalytic degradation of TC, trapping experiments were carried out. Herein, 1 mM p-benzoquinone (BQ, a superoxide radical scavenger), isopropanol (IPA, a hydroxyl radical scavenger) and triethanolamine (TEOA, a hole scavenger) were used to examine the effects of reactive species in the Bi3TaO7/g-C3N4 composite, as shown in Fig. 10. It is observed that with the addition of BQ, the photocatalytic degradation rate of TC shows a remarkably decrease, which indicates that ˙O2− plays a vital role during the TC degradation process. However, no obvious decrease in the degradation rate was observed when TEOA was added, which indicates that the H+ radical has a minor effect on the degradation of TC. Meanwhile, in the presence of IPA, the degradation rate of TC was significantly inhibited, which means that ˙OH also contributes to the degradation of TC. The trapping experiment implies that ˙OH and ˙O2− are the oxidative species in the reactions.

3.8 ESR study
The electron spin resonance (ESR) technique was applied to identify reactive oxygen species generated on the surface of the catalysts with DMPO (5,5-dimethyl-1-pyridine N-oxide) as a radical scavenger.49–51Fig. 11a shows the DMPO-˙OH characteristic peaks of g-C3N4, BTO and CB-5 composite under visible light irradiation. For g-C3N4, there are four peaks corresponding to DMPO-˙OH, but their intensities are weak compared to that of pristine Bi3TaO7. Furthermore, the CB-5 composite exhibits the strongest intensities in contrast to bare g-C3N4 and BTO, which reveals that more hydroxyl radicals are produced in the composite. For DMPO-˙O2−, no obvious signal is detected in Bi3TaO7 (Fig. 11b). However, four characteristic peaks of DMPO-˙OH are observed in the ESR spectra of g-C3N4 and CB-5 composite. It is observed that the signals of g-C3N4 are much weaker than that of the CB-5 composite, which reveals that the amount of ˙O2− produced in the CB-5 composite is more than that of pure g-C3N4. Therefore, it can be concluded that both ˙O2− and ˙OH are produced, and play crucial role toward the degradation of TC under visible light irradiation, which is in accordance with the result of the trapping experiment.

3.9 Mechanism of TC degradation over g-C3N4/Bi3TaO7 nanocomposite
The band positions of Bi3TaO7 could be calculated using following equations:52 ECB = χ − Ee − 0.5Eg(2) Eg = EVB − ECB(3)where, ECB is the conduction band edge of the semiconductor at the point of zero charge, χ is the absolute electronegativity of the semiconductor, expressed as the geometric mean of the absolute electronegativity of the constituent atoms, which is defined as the arithmetic mean of the atomic electron affinity and the first ionization energy, Ee is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (∼4.5 V) and Eg is the band gap of the semiconductor. In this case, the χ value of Bi3TaO7 is calculated to be 6.26, and Eg is estimated to be 2.84 V. Hence, the ECB of Bi3TaO7 is estimated to be +0.34 V. The EVB of Bi3TaO7 is also calculated to 3.18 V. This result is close to the previous report.53 The CB and VB edge potentials of g-C3N4 are −1.09 and +1.53 V, respectively.28,36 Generally, the photoexcited electrons in the CB of Bi3TaO7 cannot reduce O2 to generate ˙O2− because the CB edge potential of Bi3TaO7 is more positive than that of the O2/˙O2− potential.54 Moreover, the formation of hydroxyl radicals is also prohibited because the VB potential of g-C3N4 is more negative than the OH−/˙OH potential. However, both the ESR analysis and trapping experiment suggest that ˙OH and ˙O2− are the active species during the photodegradation of TC by the g-C3N4/Bi3TaO7 composite photocatalyst. In this case, the type II heterojunction mechanism is not feasible for the g-C3N4/Bi3TaO7 composite photocatalyst (Scheme 2a). On the basis of the above results, a more reasonable Z-scheme reaction mechanism for the photodegradation of TC over the Bi3TaO7 and g-C3N4 composite catalyst (Scheme 2b) is proposed as follows: g-C3N4/Bi3TaO7 + hν → g-C3N4(e− + h+)/Bi3TaO7(e− + h+)(4) g-C3N4(e−) + Bi3TaO7(h+) → hν + heat(5) g-C3N4(e−) + O2 → ˙O2−(6) Bi3TaO7(h+) + H2O → ˙OH + H+(7) ˙O2− (or ˙OH) + TC → degraded products(8)
 Scheme 2  Possible photocatalytic reaction mechanisms for the degradation of TC by the g-C3N4/Bi3TaO7 composite photocatalyst. 
Since Bi3TaO7 and g-C3N4 both generate photo-excited electron–hole pairs under visible light irradiation, the photogenerated electrons on the CB of Bi3TaO7 migrate to the VB of g-C3N4 and combine with the holes. Then, the photoinduced electrons in the CB of g-C3N4 further react with dissolved oxygen to form reactive superoxide radical anions (˙O2−), whereas the holes in the VB of Bi3TaO7 react with hydroxyl groups to form hydroxyl radicals (˙OH). Consequently, photo-generated electrons and holes are separated effectively and provide higher oxidation/reduction abilities in the g-C3N4/Bi3TaO7 composite, resulting in enhanced activity.
4. Conclusions
In summary, a novel Z-scheme solid-state g-C3N4/Bi3TaO7 composite photocatalyst was prepared via a hydrothermal route and calcination method. After the introduction of g-C3N4, the photocatalytic activity of Bi3TaO7 was enhanced 5-fold under visible light irradiation and a noticeable photocurrent was observed. The 50 wt% g-C3N4/Bi3TaO7 composite showed the highest activity, where the degradation rate of TC achieved was 89.2% within 90 min under visible light irradiation. The Z-scheme photocatalytic reaction mechanism remarkably improved the visible-light induced photocatalysis due to the enhancement in redox ability. It is expected that the g-C3N4/Bi3TaO7 composite could be used as a promising photocatalyst in pollutant purification.
