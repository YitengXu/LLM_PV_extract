In recent years, near-infrared (NIR) phosphorescence beyond the visible region (700–2500 nm) has emerged as a new, promising, and challenging research field with potential applications toward NIR OLEDs, telecommunications, night vision-readable displays. Moreover, NIR phosphorescence holds promise for in vivo imaging, because cells and tissues exhibit little absorption and auto-fluorescence in this spectral region. This review describes the overall progress made in the past ten years on NIR phosphorescent transition-metal complexes including Cu(I), Cu(II), Cr(III), Re(I), Re(III), Ru(II), Os(II), Ir(III), Pt(II), Pd(II), Au(I), and Au(III) complexes, with a primary focus on material design complemented with a selection of optical, electronic, sensory, and biologic applications.

This range of wavelengths corresponding to a frequency range of approximately 430 THz to 300 GHz can be divided into three parts: near-infrared (NIR), mid-infrared, and far-infrared regions. The NIR region typically falls in the spectrum from 700 to 2500 nm (120 to 430 THz). Nearly 50% of the energy from the Sun reaching the Earth is in the form of NIR radiation, as shown in Fig. 1a. At present, one of the key limiting factors for organic solar cells or photovoltaic cells (PVCs) is the mismatch between the absorption spectrum of organic dyes and the solar emission spectrum, thus it is important to extend the absorption of organic dyes from the ultra violet (UV)/visible into the NIR region. Using NIR light for sensing and detection offers additional benefits for being invisible and having less interference. Moreover, biological tissues have minimal absorption and auto-fluorescence in the NIR region (Fig. 1b), allowing for deeper penetration of light in comparison to visible light. This “imaging window” is a clear advantage for the use of NIR materials as tags or stains for real-time in vivo biological imaging. NIR light is also commonly used in fiber optic telecommunication and night vision-readable displays. Therefore, considerable and growing attention has been spent during the past decade on the development of NIR light-emitting materials or dyes for a variety of applications in the chemical and life sciences.1–15 A search in Web of Knowledge, Thomson Reuters, for documents containing the terms “NIR/IR” and “emission” or its synonym in the title and published from 2000 to September, 2012 resulted in about 8400 hits (Fig. 2), in which ∼30% are about NIR light-emitting materials. Fig. 1  (a) The Sun's power spectrum (AM1.5) reaching the Earth. (b) Absorbance of various tissue and blood components from 200 nm to 10 μm (adapted from ref. 14).  Fig. 2  Published documents, searched in Web of Knowledge, Thomson Reuters, from 2000 to September, 2012, about NIR/IR light-emitting materials. In general, visible16–31 and NIR1–15 light-emitting materials consist of inorganic materials (metal oxides and semiconductor nanocrystals) and organic materials (metal complexes and pure organic compounds), which are fluorescent and widely studied due to their rich chemical structures, ease of chemical modification and high fluorescence quantum yield (ΦF). In contrast to the short emission decay lifetime (τ) associated with standard fluorescence, lanthanide complexes32–36 typically exhibit long-lived emissions, in the order of microseconds to milliseconds, in the visible and NIR regions. Accordingly, appropriate delay time filters allow for the avoidance of interference from short-lived background fluorescence and scattering light with these complexes. However, the extremely sharp metal-centered (MC) emission of most lanthanide complexes is not phosphorescence in the conventional sense because it does not originate from a transition between two states of different multiplicity and is not sensitive to oxygen.32,37,38 Recently, room-temperature (RT) visible (red, green, and blue) phosphorescent d6, d8, and d10 transition-metal complexes,37–59 such as Ru(II),60–64 Pt(II),65–69 Ir(III),70,71 Au(I), Au(III),72–75 and Cu(I),76 have been a major focus of research, due to their wide and useful applications in phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs),37,42–44,47,49,54,56,57,62,64,68,69,71 light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs),40,42,46,55,63 triplet–triplet annihilation based upconversion (TTAU),51,59 PVCs,41,47,53,61 chemosensors,38–39,52,57,58 therapy,45,74 and bio-imaging.48,58 Compared with traditional fluorescent materials, phosphorescent transition-metal complexes offer several important advantages. Phosphorescence originates in the transition from the triplet excited state (T1) to the singlet ground state (S0), and thus enables the harvest of both singlet and triplet excitons to achieve a maximum internal quantum efficiency of 100% in OLEDs.77,78 Phosphorescence provides a longer decay lifetime up to milliseconds. Phosphorescence exhibits larger Stokes' shifts compared to fluorescence due to the energy loss in intersystem crossing between S1 and T1, thus decreasing spectral interference between the excitation light and the phosphorescent emission. The possible excited states of phosphorescent transition-metal complexes52 include triplet metal-to-ligand charge transfer (3MLCT), intraligand charge transfer (3ILCT), ligand-to-ligand charge transfer (3LLCT), ligand-to-metal charge transfer (3LMCT), metal–metal-to-ligand charge transfer (3MMLCT), ligand-to-metal–metal charge transfer (3LMMCT), and metal-to-ligand–ligand charge transfer (3MLLCT), which depend on the metal centers, chemical structures and triplet state energy levels of the ligands, local environment, and intermolecular interaction, and thus their absorption (λabs) and emission wavelength (λem), τ, and phosphorescence quantum efficiency (ΦP) can be fine-tuned through the modification of ligand structures and metal centres.Up to now, there have been some published reviews summarizing the recent developments and applications of NIR fluorescence1–15 and visible phosphorescence.37–76 Combining their advantages, NIR phosphorescence has emerged as a new, promising, and challenging research field. This critical review, which focuses mainly on material design, describes the overall progress made in the last ten years in NIR phosphorescent transition-metal complexes and their applications. Additionally, a blueprint for future development in this field is suggested. In this review, NIR emitters are defined as materials where their λem is equal to or longer than 700 nm at RT, but sometimes some of their derivatives, whose λem is shorter than 700 nm but longer than 665 nm are also involved for comparative purposes.2. General principles of NIR phosphorescence2.1 Nature of the excited state in phosphorescencePhotoluminescence (PL) that includes both fluorescence (F) and phosphorescence (P) is spontaneous emission following absorption of electromagnetic radiation of an appropriate frequency in the UV/visible region. Phosphorescence, a spin-forbidden transition, occurs during relaxation of an electron from the triplet excited state to the ground state (T1 → S0), while fluorescence is a radiative transition between electronic states of the same multiplicity (S1 → S0). Since phosphorescence involves the intersystem crossing between S1 and T1, τ (10−6–10−3 s) and Stokes' shift of phosphorescence are typically longer and larger than that of fluorescence (τ: 10−9–10−7 s), as shown in Fig. 3. Since the ground state of oxygen is a triplet state, it can quench phosphorescence by through-space energy transfer with the long-lived triplet of the luminophore. Accordingly, another important feature of phosphorescent materials is that they can serve as oxygen sensors.38,79–83 Fig. 3  Jablonski diagram: E - energy, A - absorption, F - fluorescence, P - phosphorescence, IC - internal conversion, ISC - intersystem crossing, VR - vibrational relaxation, S - singlet state, T - triplet state. It is rare to observe RT phosphorescence from pure organic compounds due to the predominance of accessible thermal decay pathways. Therefore, incorporation into typically organized media (in the host of cyclodextrin,84 polymer,85,86 or crystal87–89) or the addition of heavy atoms such as halogens,88–91 Tl(I),92 Pb(II),92 P(III),93 Sb(III),93 or Bi(III)92–94 [McClure heavy-atom spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect]95 are required for RT phosphorescence. Still, most of these materials exhibit weak phosphorescence in solution at RT. A more efficient way to achieve RT phosphorescence is adopting cyclometalated transition-metal complexes. These complexes exhibit higher stability and stronger RT phosphorescence, in both solution and solid state, than other organic dyes because of the following three reasons. (1) Cyclometalated transition-metal complexes tend to form a strong bonding interaction with transition-metal elements. (2) The stronger metal–ligand bonding increases the d–d energy gap and affords less radiation-less quenching due to the suppressed population of the higher lying, repulsive d–d excited state; this is particularly true for the third-row transition-metal elements. (3) The occurrence of close-lying, ligand-centered 3π–π* electronic transitions allows for facile tuning of the emission wavelength.49,96For transition-metal complexes, the construction of Jablonski diagrams via electronic configurations from the molecular orbitals (MOs) description follows the same general lines described for organic molecules.97 Since most NIR transition-metal complexes are Pt(II) complexes, a schematic MO diagram for Pt(II) complexes is shown in Fig. 4 as an example. Unlike other well-known octahedral d6 Ru(II), Ir(III), Re(I), or Os(II) complexes, d8 Pt(II) complexes adopt a square-planar geometry and possess a vacant coordination site at the Pt(II) center, which allows axial substrate-binding interactions and might lead to effective emission quenching (Fig. 5). Therefore, Pt(II) complexes that have diverse excited states including not only (π–π*) 3ILCT and (d–π*) 3MLCT common to normal transition-metal complexes, but also 3MMLCT can emit strong phosphorescence from the visible to the NIR region resulting from avoiding the quenching of free axial coordinating site and strong Pt–Pt interactions. Fig. 4  Schematic energy level diagram of MOs and possible electronic transitions in a square-planar Pt(II) complex. 1: π–π*, 2: LMCT, 3: ligand field transition (LF or d–d), 4: MLCT, 5: d–s MC Transition, 6: d–p MC Transition.  Fig. 5  Schematic geometry diagram of d6 Ru(II) and d8 Pt(II) complexes. 2.1.1 MC d–d excited state. Typical metal complexes with a partially filled d shell at the metal center are characterized by low-energy MC excitation states which arise from electron hopping between the nonbonding (dπ) and antibonding (dσ*) orbitals. These d–d transitions are Laporte-forbidden, showing exceedingly low transition probability for the occurrence of both MC-based absorption and emission signals. The emissions derived from the d–d excited states of Pt(II) complexes are broad, structure-less and relatively matrix-independent but temperature dependent. The quantum yield is generally low, but can be increased by removing high-frequency vibrations from the coordination sphere; a typical example is [Pt(bpy)(Cl)2]98–101 (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) (Fig. 6). The emitting state of [Pt(bpy)(Cl)2] was assigned to a 3(d–d) transition as early as in 1989, but a more probable 3MLCT assignment cannot be excluded.98 The 3(d–d) emission from this complex in diluted solution is vanishingly weak but at 77 K, a broad unstructured emission with λem at ca. 620 nm is observed in diluted glassy solution. Another milestone example that exhibits green emission (λem = 514 nm and τ = 9 μs) in aqueous solution is [Pt2(μ-P2O5H2)4]4−.102 This pyrophosphito-bridged diplatinum(II) complex with strong Pt–Pt interaction exhibits unique photophysical properties from a 3[ndσ* → (n + 1)pσ] excited state (Fig. 7). Fig. 6  Chemical structure of some phosphorescent transition-metal complexes with different excitation states.  Fig. 7  Qualitative molecular orbital interaction diagram for diplatinum(II) complex and the relative energy between LLCT, MMLCT and MC 3[dσ*–pσ] states. 2.1.2 ILCT. Intraligand (IL) or ligand-centered (LC) excited states originate from electronic transitions between π orbitals that are mainly localized on the ligand chromophore. As such, if the metal perturbation upon coordination is minimized, the luminescent complex may exhibit a transition that has relatively solvent-independent spectral properties closely resembling the free ligand states. The 3LC emission energy is much less affected by heavy metal ions. A typical example is [Pt(TPP)] (TPP = meso-tetraphenylporphyrin) (Fig. 6). The 3LC emission from this complex in CH2Cl2 solution at RT occurs at λem = 660 nm, similar with the free ligand of TPP (λem = 650 nm) (Fig. 8). Another typical example is [Pt(bpy)(en)]2+ (en = ethanediamine).98 The 3LC emission from this complex in diluted glassy solution at 77 K occurs at λem = 485 nm with overlapping vibronic progressions at ca. 1400 and 1000 cm−1, which is in excellent agreement with the phosphorescence spectrum of [Zn(bpy)2]2+. Fig. 8  Emission spectra of [Pt(TPP)] and TPP in CH2Cl2 at RT. 2.1.3 MLCT. The photochemistry of transition-metal complexes is mainly dominated by studies of the 3MLCT excited state of luminescent Ru(II) polypyridine complexes,103 such as [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (Fig. 5 and 6). 3MLCT states involve electronic transitions from a metal-based d orbital to a ligand-based delocalized π* antibonding orbital. In a conventional sense, the corresponding excitation results in metal oxidation and concomitant ligand reduction. These transitions are commonly observed in the middle- and late-transition-metal complexes possessing relatively low oxidation potentials.44 As a result, the emission energy of 3MLCT, which depends on the reduction potential of the ligand and the oxidation potential of the metal ion, can be tuned by the auxiliary ligands and affected by the polarity of the solvent/medium. A typical example of 3MLCT Pt(II) complexes is [Pt(phbpy)(PPh3)]+ (phbpy = 6-phenyl-2,2′-bipyridine and PPh3 = triphenylphosphine)104 (Fig. 6), which exhibits an intense greenish yellow emission in degassed MeCN solution at 298 K (λem = 535 nm and τ = 0.9 μs). Other typical examples include [Pt(3,3(MeO2C)2bpy)Cl2]100 [3,3(MeO2C)2bpy = 3,3′-dicarbethoxy-2,2′-bipyridine] and [Pt(5,5Me2bpy)(CCPh)2]105 (5,5Me2bpy = 5,5′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine and CCPh = phenylacetylene) (Fig. 6). The lowest-lying excited state of [Pt(3,3(MeO2C)2bpy)(Cl)2] is now the 3MLCT state, but the d–d state lies only a little higher in energy, offering the 3MLCT a non-radiative decay pathway and also rendering this complex non-emissive at RT like [Pt(bpy)(Cl)2]. On the other hand, [Pt(5,5Me2bpy)(CCPh)2] is much more emissive at RT than [Pt(bpy)(Cl)2] both in fluid solution (λmax = 545 nm, τ=1.6 μs, and ΦP = 0.64 in CH2Cl2) and in the solid state, due to the stronger ligand-field associated with the acetylide compared to the chloride co-ligands. Notably, many highly emissive transition-metal complexes, especially for high-performance phosphorescent OLEDs applications, are Ir(III) or Pt(II) complex, such as [Ir(ppy)3]106 (ppy = 2-phenylpyridyl), [Ir(ppy)2(acac)] (acac = acetyl acetone),107 and [Pt(ppy)(acac)],108 with emission characteristic of phosphorescence from 3MLCT and/or 3ILCT.2.1.4 LMCT and LLCT. Transition-metal complexes with metal atoms in high oxidation states can show luminescence from 3LMCT.44 These complexes typically constitute early transition-metal complexes, such as Ta(V) complexes,109,110 and exhibit RT phosphorescence at the lower energy region of the visible spectra with lower quantum efficiencies. Other candidates that exhibit 3LMCT emission are polynuclear d10 complexes involving Au(I) and Cu(I) complexes.393LMCT excited states are seldom the lowest in energy for Pt(II) complexes. In heteroleptic complexes where LL′CT excited states have been proposed, it is likely that the LL′CT excited states should also exhibit ML′CT character. This is because Pt(5d) orbitals should strongly couple with the π orbitals of L′. Typical examples are [Pt(α-diimine)(dithiolate)] complexes,111,112 such as [Pt(dbbpy)(tdt)] (dbbpy = 4,4′-di-tert-butyl-2,2′-bipyridine and tdt = toluene-3,4-dithiolate) complex (Fig. 6), where L is dithiolate and L′ is the aromatic α-diimine ligand. Most of these complexes, however, have lower ΦP than previously mentioned for 3MLCT and/or 3ILCT emitting materials.2.1.5 MMLCT. Miskowski and co-workers proposed oligomeric 3MMLCT (Fig. 7) based on a series of discrete d8–d8 binuclear Pt(II) complexes, namely, [(Pt(tpy))2(μ-L)]n+ (tpy = 2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine, L = bidentate ligand),113,114 which exhibit red-to-NIR emission (λem = 630–730 nm), depending on the Pt–Pt distances (3.00–3.43 Å), in the solid state at RT. For shorter Pt–Pt contacts (3.00 Å) in [(Pt(tpy))2(μ-can)]3+ (can = arginine) (Fig. 6), the lowest excited state is 3[dσ*(dz2(Pt)) → π*(diimine)] (3MMLCT) (λem = 730 nm). As the intra platinum distance increases to 3.43 Å in [(Pt(tpy))2(μ-pz)]3+ (pz = pyrazol), the energy of 3[dσ*(dz2(Pt)) → π*(diimine)] also increases (λem = 630 nm). At sufficiently large Pt–Pt separations, the 3[dσ*(dz2(Pt)) → π*(diimine)] will move above 3[π → π*(diimine)]. For example, [(Pt(tpy))2(μ-pz)]3+ displays both 3[dσ*(dz2(Pt)) → π*(diimine)] and 3[π → π*(diimine)] emission.How to identify these excited states? Many methods, such as excited-state lifetime measurements,115,116 time-resolved luminescence spectroscopy,100,115,117,118 and computational investigations,44,119–121 have been used to understand the nature of the excited state in transition-metal complexes. The most important and useful transitions of phosphorescent transition-metal complexes are 3ILCT and 3MLCT. Yersin et al. utilized the amount of zero-field splitting (ZFS) to classify the degree of MLCT perturbation and SOC efficiency in the emitting triplet state for phosphorescent transition-metal complexes,56,122–126 thus providing a useful scale not only for an assessment of the MLCT perturbation in the T1 state but also for phosphorescence τ (Fig. 9). SOC provides a softening of the spin-forbidden character of the transitions between T1 and S0 resulting in a desired reduction of τ. Therefore, phosphorescent transition-metal complexes with larger ZFS are expected to have shorter τ values. In addition to ΦP and λem, τ is another important parameter of phosphorescence in regards to applications. For example, phosphorescent transition-metal complexes with short τ values (τ < 10 μs, ZFS > 10 cm−1, 3MLCT or 3MLCT/3ILCT) have less triplet–triplet annihilation and result in less roll-off in the quantum efficiency in phosphorescent OLEDs.127 On the other hand, due to the lack of direct incorporation with metal-center electron density, transition-metal complexes with 3ILCT are subject to much longer τ. This is useful for avoiding the spectral interference from short-lived background fluorescence and scattering light and it has clear advantages in such applications as chemical sensors and bio-imaging. It should be noted that mixing of 3ILCT and 3MLCT states may play an important role for decent ΦP, because this intersystem crossing can be enhanced for the systems involving notable MLCT participation.44 Fig. 9  Phosphorescence τ (300 K) versus ZFS (red curve) and ordering scheme showing metal complexes with increasing MLCT character in the emissive triplet state for transition-metal complexes (adapted from ref. 56 and 126). 2.2 Tuning the lowest excited statesIt is important to tune the lowest excited states, the type or energy (emission color or wavelength), of transition-metal complexes because they decide the photophysical properties. The most effective methods for tuning the lowest excited state involves modifications in the participating (cyclometalated and/or ancillary) ligands, such as changing the degree of π-conjugation, altering substituents, and adding heterocycles.44,128As mentioned previously, three Pt(II) bipyridine100 complexes (Fig. 10) with similar chemical structures exhibit different lowest excited states. The energy of 3ILCT [π–π*(bpy)] in [Pt(bpy)(en)]2+ is lower than that of 3MLCT [d–π*(bpy)] and 3LF (d–d) and thus the lowest excited state of [Pt(bpy)(en)]2+ is 3ILCT (Fig. 10). The large stabilization of 3MLCT and 3LF for [Pt(bpy)(Cl)2] can be attributed to the strongly σ-donating character of the chloride ligands, resulting in 3LF becoming the lowest excited state. Furthermore, the strongly electron-withdrawing substituents of –CO2Me on the bipyridine ligand of [Pt(3,3′-(MeO2C)2bpy)(Cl)2] have stabilized a bpy π* level, yielding a 3MLCT [d–π*(bpy)] state as the lowest energy excited state. In addition to cyclometalated ligands, ancillary ligands [–(CCR)] in [Pt(phbpy)(CCR)] heteroleptic complexes129 also exhibit a strong effect on the nature of the lowest excited state, as shown in Fig. 11. Fig. 10  Estimates of the energies of lowest excited states of three Pt(II) bpy complexes (adapted from ref. 100).  Fig. 11  The lowest excited states of [Pt(phbpy)(CCR)] complexes (adapted from ref. 129). 2.3 Tuning emission into NIR regionThe optical and electronic properties of organic molecules are determined by their energy gap, which is the energy separation between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), also called the HOMO–LUMO gap. The red shift in the absorption and emission spectra resulting from a narrowing of this energy gap is a key in the design of NIR emitters. Generally, for NIR fluorescent materials, several design factors, such as the π-conjugation length, bond length alternation, and donor–acceptor (DA) system,3,5,11 should be considered. These factors are also useful for the ligand design in NIR phosphorescent transition-metal complexes. Moreover, the great success in the material design for visible phosphorescent transition-metal complexes, especially for phosphorescent OLEDs, provides useful experiences for extending visible emission into NIR emission.2.3.1 Effect of substituents in ligand. The effect of substituents on the emission characteristics is quite complex and generalizations should be made with caution. Both the nature and position of a substituent can alter these characteristics. As early as 1991, the first extended series of fac-tris-ppy Ir(III) complexes with different electron-withdrawing (e.g., –F, –CF3) and electron-donating (e.g., –t-Bu, –OMe) groups was reported by Watts and coworkers.130 Electron-withdrawing substituents tend to stabilize the HOMO by removing electron density from the metal and result in a blue shift of emission, whereas donating groups have an inverse effect. Moreover, the cyclometalated and ancillary ligands can be separately substituted with electron-withdrawing and -donating groups in heteroleptic complexes, which enables deliberate control of the excited state from blue to red emission,106–108,128,129 as shown in Fig. 12. Tuning phosphorescence from blue-green-red emission into the NIR region merely by the substituent effect, however, is rare, presumably since the contribution of ligand substituents to the emission characteristics is much smaller than that of the intrinsic π-conjugated system of the parent ligand. Some other effects, such as vibrational coupling of the excited and the ground state and energy gap law (see Section 2.4), must be considered as well. Fig. 12  Color versatility expressed by a series of six cationic Ir(III) complexes. The evolution of 3LC (vibrationally structured, high-energy bands) and 3MLCT character (structureless, low-energy bands) in the luminescence spectra are indicative of a mixed excited state (adapted from ref. 128). 2.3.2 Effect of π-conjugation length in the ligand. For fluorescent materials, the extension of the π-conjugated system can lead to a decrease in the energy gap to a certain extent.131–133 For example, by adjusting the number of fused naphthalene units in the rylenediimide dyes,131 the energy gap can be tuned over a quite large range, e.g., from roughly 1.29 eV (960 nm) to 2.15 eV (577 nm) (Fig. 13). However, the energy gap of a π-conjugated system can only be lowered to a certain limit by increasing the chain length. There is strong experimental support, in the case of polythiophene and phenyl–vinyl oligomers, that oligomers with more than 5 to 8 repeating units bear all of the essential electronic properties (e.g., absorption and emission of light) of infinite polymer chains.134–137 Another challenge is how to synthesize and improve the solubility of these rigid extended π-conjugated materials. Fig. 13  Absorption spectra of the entire tetraphenoxy-substituted rylenediimide series in CHCl3 (adapted from ref. 131). For phosphorescent transition-metal complexes, one of most effective ways to reduce the emission energy into NIR region involves expanding the length of π-conjugation in the ligand. There are many successful instances43,106–108,128,129 of red shifting in phosphorescent emission spectra by extending π-conjugation length in the ligand. For example, compared with [Ir(ppy)2(acac)], other [Ir(L)2(acac)] complexes with the larger π-conjugated system of either an isoquinoline or a naphthyl group, show a red shift in emission spectra (Fig. 14).43 The complex involved the rigid azaperylene ligand demonstrated a particularly marked red shift, emitting at 932 nm. This emission energy is very close to the phosphorescent emission from perylene (800 nm), suggesting that the excited state in this complexes is predominantly 3ILCT. Furthermore, if the ancillary ligand has a lower triplet energy than the cyclometalated moiety, this ligand becomes directly involved in the emission process. For example, the ancillary ligand of 1-ethynylpyrene in the [Pt(phbpy)(CC–pyrenyl-1)] heteroleptic complex (Fig. 11) affords a low-energy and narrow-bandwidth emission at 664 nm with major vibronic progression, τ and ΦP of 1230 cm−1, 20.8 μs and 0.01, respectively, in CH2Cl2 solution at 298 K. This deep-red emission is also assigned to 3ILCT in the ancillary ligand of 1-ethynylpyrene.129 Fig. 14  Ligand definitions and emission energies for a series of [Ir(L)2(acac)] complexes. Nonetheless, is it right that the more (the π-conjugated length in the ligand), the better (the decrease of energy gap)? On the one hand, the energy gap of a π-conjugated system for fluorescent materials or ligands can only be lowered to a certain value by increasing the number of π-bonds involved, as discussed previously. On the other hand, for phosphorescent transition-metal complexes, as the length of π-conjugation in the ligand increases, the extent of participation of metal d orbitals in the highest-occupied molecular orbitals decreases while the S1 → T1 energy gap increases, resulting in the attenuated ISC effect. As a result, the fluorescence becomes observable while the intensity of the phosphorescence decreases due to the combined effects of a lower yield of triplet formation, a decreased T1 → S0 radiative decay rate, and increased non-radiative decay as the excited state energy decreases.38 Thus, dual fluorescence/phosphorescence emission is obtained by reducing phosphorescence and increasing fluorescence. There are several examples138–142 of dual fluorescent/phosphorescent Pt(II) and Os(II) complexes, because these complexes usually have lower efficiency of spin-orbit coupling than Ir(III) complexes.140,142 For example, whereas [Pt(thpy)(acac)] [thpy = 2-(2-thienyl)pyridine] solely displays intense phosphorescence (ΦP = 0.36) from a triplet state of mixed 3π–π*/MLCT character, the phosphorescence of [Pt(th2py)(acac)] [th2py = 5-(2-pyridyl)-2,2′-bithiophene] is weak (ΦF+P = 5.8 × 10−3), strongly red shifted, and accompanied by higher-energy fluorescence (Fig. 15).140 Therefore, extending π-conjugated length in the ligand is a double-edged sword, in that it might have positive and negative effects for the purpose of NIR phosphorescence. Fig. 15  Normalized emission spectra of [Pt(thpy)(acac)] and [Pt(th2py)(acac)] in CH2Cl2 at 298 K (adapted from ref. 140). 2.3.3 Effect of heteroatoms/heterocycles in the ligand. Complexes containing softer and more polarizable heteroatoms such as sulfur and oxygen incorporated in the ring system of the ligand are much easier to oxidize and have significantly lower transition energies. Therefore, this represents an effective way to achieve a red shift in the corresponding emission spectra. As shown in Fig. 16, the complexes containing the thienyl (X = S) or furyl (X = O) moiety as cyclometalated carbon donor exhibit substantially red-shifted emission compared with the [Pt(phbpy)(CCPh)] (X = CH = CH) complex.129 Fig. 16  Emission spectra of [Pt(X⁁N⁁N)(CCPh)]in alcoholic glass at 77 K (adapted from ref. 129). 2.3.4 Effect of the donor–acceptor (DA) system in the ligand. Introduction of a strong intramolecular DA system in strictly organic small molecules and polymers is a common strategy of lowering the energy gap.3,5,11 If the HOMO levels of the donor and the LUMO levels of the acceptor moiety are close in energy, the resulting band structure will show a low energy gap as depicted in Fig. 17. Recently, a significant amount of work43,143–150 has demonstrated that DA system is a new strategy for phosphorescent transition-metal complexes to achieve the purpose of lowering the energy gap. As shown in Fig. 18, [Pt(DAbpy)(Ph)2] complex with an incorporated DA system shows red-shifted emission when compared with [Pt(D2bpy)(Ph)2] and [Pt(A2bpy)(Ph)2] complexes with only donors or acceptors, respectively.144 It is noteworthy that many of these complexes do not have strong RT phosphorescence, but intense absorption bands in the visible and NIR regions, which might be caused by the fact of non-radiative charge transfer in the DA system. This phenomenon should not limit the applications of such complexes in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), chemical sensors, and the photogeneration of H2.143–149 Fig. 17  Molecular orbital interaction in donor (D) and acceptor (A) moieties leading to a D–A monomer with an unusually low HOMO–LUMO energy separation (adapted from ref. 3)  Fig. 18  Emission spectra of [Pt(DAbpy)(Ph)2] (red curve), [Pt(A2bpy)(Ph)2] (black curve), and [Pt(D2bpy)(Ph)2] (blue curve) complex in CH2Cl2 at 77K (adapted from ref. 144). 2.3.5 Effect of intramolecular metal–metal interactions. As mentioned previously, multinuclear d8 Pt(II)113,114,151–161 or d10 Au(I)39 complexes can exhibit strong intramolecular metal–metal interactions, leading to red-shifted emission in dilute solution and solid from 3MMLCT. This is another effective strategy for the design of NIR phosphorescent transition-metal complexes. As examples, [(Pt(phbpy))2(μ-dppm)]2+ [dppm = bis(diphenylphosphino)methane, n = 1] with the shortest intramolecular Pt–Pt contact of 3.27 Å shows an obvious red shift in emission spectra compared with [(Pt(phbpy))2(μ-pz)]+ (Pt–Pt contact of 3.61 Å) and [(Pt(phbpy))2(μ-dppp)]2+ [dppp = bis(diphenylphosphino)pentane, n = 5] (Fig. 19).152 Fig. 19  Normalized emission spectra of [(Pt(phbpy))2(μ-dppm)]2+ (red curve), [(Pt(phbpy))2(μ-dppp)]2+ (black curve), and [(Pt(phbpy))2(μ-pz)]+ (blue curve) in MeCN at 77 K (adapted from ref. 152). 2.3.6 Other effects. The effects on the energy gap tuning as discussed above are mainly involved in the individual molecules and oligomers without consideration of any intermolecular interaction. Intermolecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, molecular π–π stacking, and charge transfer, also cause a change in the energy gap for the molecules in aggregated states.11,162,163 Square-planar Pt(II) complexes, in particular, can readily form excimers, exciplexes or aggregates,164,165 resulting in red-shifted166,167 or white168–171 emission at high concentration in solution or solid. For example, [Pt(bpy)(Cl)2] (Fig. 6) has two types of stable crystal structures. One is a weakly luminescent yellow form, in which the Pt(II) complexes are spatially well separated from each other (the Pt–Pt distance = 4.44 Å). The other is a strongly red emissive form, in which the square-planar [Pt(bpy)(Cl)2] units stack to form an approximately linear Pt–Pt chain with a metal–metal spacing of 3.45 Å.98–101,172 Another typical example is [Pt(46dFppy)(acac)] complex168–171 [46dFppy = (2-(4,6-difluorophenyl)pyridin)], which can be doped into the host material of 4,4′-N,N-dicarbazole-biphenyl (CBP) to achieve white emission resulting from a combination of blue emission from monomers and yellow emission from excimers, as depicted in Fig. 20. Fig. 20  Emission spectra of [Pt(46dFppy)(acac)]-doped CBP films. 2.4 Methods to achieve high phosphorescence quantum efficiency (ΦP)In principle, emission quantum efficiency (Φ), either ΦF or ΦP, is determined in relation to the radiative rate constant (kr) and the non-radiative rate constant (knr): (1) The rate constants have a strong dependence on the energy gap (ΔE) between the emissive excited state and the ground state, formulated as43,173 (2) (3) The well-known “energy gap law” depicted in eqn (2) indicates that knr increases with a decrease of ΔE (α and β are constant). Amn in eqn (3) is Einstein's A coefficient and Mmn is the emission transition moment between the mth and nth state. Obviously, in order to achieve a red shift in emission, small ΔE is required, which tends to give larger knr and smaller kr, and results in the lower emission quantum yield. This is a leading factor for why efficient NIR emitters have not been well developed. In addition to suppressing the concomitant increase of knr and a decrease of kr with a decreasing ΔE, improving the spin–orbit coupling effect is essential for obtaining efficient NIR phosphorescent materials. Thus, in order to describe ΦP, it is required to consider the nature of the ground state and involved excited states and relevant photophysical interactions among them.71 Empirically, in many cases, the extension of π-conjugation length, the increase of rigidity, or the presence of bulky steric substituents in ligand is beneficial to high ΦP.3. Classification according to the ligandAs discussed above, phosphorescence originating from either 3MLCT or 3ILCT is related to the ligands, thus the aromatic N-donor and/or cyclometalated ligands play an important role in phosphorescence. For easy metalation, the cyclometalated ligand usually has an ancillary donor, such as an N, P atom or a carbene, that can form an initial dative bonding with the transition-metal element, holding the adjacent C–H bond close to the electron rich metal center. Then, intramolecular cleavage of the C–H bond takes place, forming both the metal-containing cyclic framework along with a metal–hydride fragment; the latter then undergoes hydride abstraction leaving only the more stable complex, as depicted in Fig. 21.49 Fig. 21  Schematic pathway of the cyclometalation reaction (D = ancillary donor in the cyclometalated ligand) (adapted from ref. 49). In the literature, there are several reviews about the mechanism of such cyclometalation reactions174–177 and the synthesis of cyclometalated ligands;178 these reviews should be consulted for selecting suitable cyclometalated ligands and transition-metal reagents. According to its coordination number, the aromatic N-donor and/or cyclometalated ligands can be classified into the following categories.3.1 Bidentate ligands3.1.1 N⁁N ligand. The first and classic type of bidentate ligand consists of the bipyridyl framework, such as bpy, 1,10-phenanthroline (phen), 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (4,7Ph2phen) (Fig. 22), denoted as N⁁N chelate. These ligands are capable of possessing σ-donating nitrogen atoms and π-accepting molecular orbitals to implement the required metal–chelate bonding interaction. These N⁁N ligands can be metalated with many transition-metal atoms, such as Ru(II), Cu(I), Ir(III), and Os(II), to form the corresponding ionic complexes (e.g., [Ru(bpy)3]2+). Such complexes are useful for the application in LECs,40,42,46,55,63 because the emissive layer requires an excess of mobile ions. Alternatively, due to the strong electrostatic attractions of the oppositely charged particles in the condensed phase, these ionic complexes are significantly less volatile and become immiscible in a non-polar matrix, making them poorly suited toward the application in vacuum-deposited OLEDs. Recently, highly emissive neutral Ru(II) and Os(II) complexes for the application in OLEDs were achieved by using the cyclometalated ligand of 2-pyridyl-C-linked azoles, such as pyrazole (pypz), triazole (pytriz) and tetrazole (pytetraz) (Fig. 22).43,49,64 The high acidity of the azole N–H bond makes C-linked 2-pyridyl azoles more reactive and able to extend the scope of the N⁁N cyclometalation reaction. Fig. 22  Chemical structures of some N⁁N, C⁁N, C⁁C, and C⁁P ligands [1-phenyl-3-methylimidazolin-2-ylidene (pmi), 1-phenyl-3-methyl benzimidazolin-2-ylidene (pmb) 1-(2,4-difluorobenzyl)-3-methylbenzimidazolium (24dFb-mb), bz-PPh2, and (2,4-difluorobenzyl)diphenylphosphine (24dFbz-PPh2)]. Metal d6 tris-N⁁N complexes have some disadvantages, however, for instance, [Ru(bpy)3]2+ complexing with asymmetric chelating ligands can have either a facial (fac) or a meridional (mer) configuration. For these cationic Ru(II) diimine complexes, it has been difficult to obtain a specific isomer. Moreover, it is difficult to tune the photophysical properties for this class of ligands, either ppy or pypz, due to their similar electronic and coordinating characteristics.106 Therefore, the combination of the π-accepting pyridyls with oxidizable metals leads to low-energy 3MLCT, as in the infamous red-emitting [Ru(bpy)3]2+ complex.3.1.2 C⁁N cyclometalated ligand. The second and well-known type of bidentate cyclometalated ligand, denoted as C⁁N chelate, consists of 2-phenylpyridyl, such as ppy, 46dFppy, 1-phenylpyrazolyl (ppz), 1-(4,6-difluorophenyl)pyrazolyl (46dFppz), and thpy (Fig. 22).43,49,106,107 These ligands are famous for the metalation of highly emissive neutral Ir(III) complexes for the application in OLEDs. Since this metalation involves removal of a proton from the aromatic heterocycle, the cyclometalated ligands are anionic, in contrary to neutral bpy ligand. Therefore, combining with a π-accepting heterocycle (e.g., pyridine), the strongly σ-donating C⁁N ligands offer very strong M–C covalent interactions as well as highly stabilized ligand-field strength toward the metal ion. Consequently, the energy of MC d–d excited states in these complexes, which generally serves as a major nonradiative deactivating channel, is raised substantially relative to those of neutral diimine ligands such as bpy; the latter tends to yield relatively less luminous metal complexes at RT. As a result, C⁁N cyclometalation offers a good synthetic protocol, yielding efficient luminescent metal complexes. Moreover, the π–π* energy gap of the C⁁N ligand plays an important role in fine-tuning the emission wavelength of the complexes.43,493.1.3 C⁁C and C⁁P cyclometalated ligand. Recently, N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHC)179 and benzyldiphenylphosphines (bz-PPh2),180,181 denoted as C⁁C and C⁁P chelates, respectively, have been introduced as a new variation for cyclometalated chelates (Fig. 22). These π-conjugated or non-conjugated NHC and C⁁P ligands with large enough ligand-centered π–π* energy gaps are good candidates for blue and near ultraviolet-blue phosphorescent transition-metal complexes,180–186 which are out of the focus of this review.3.2 Terdentate ligandDeveloped from bpy, the terdentate ligands, such as tpy (denoted as N⁁N⁁N), phbpy (denoted as C⁁N⁁N), 1,3-di(2-pyridyl)benzene (dpyb) (denoted as N⁁C⁁N), and 2,6-diphenylpyridine (dppy) (denoted as C⁁N⁁C) (Fig. 23) are also well studied.16,43,187–190 Complexes involving d6 metals and the extended π-conjugated terdentate cyclometalated ligands typically have high stability due to the dissociation of the metal ion and the favourable formation of bis-terdentate complexes, resulting in red-shifted absorption and emission spectra. Bis-terdentate d6 complexes offer structural advantages over tris-bipyridyl analogues, being achiral and more amenable to linear extension. Nevertheless, bis-terdentate d6 complexes exhibit distorted octahedral geometry with the poorer bite angles and weaker ligand-field strengths and thus the ΦP is sometimes lower than tris-bidentate d6 complexes. Unlike d6 complexes, d8 complexes, such as Pt(II) complexes, adopt a square-planar geometry, which is favourable for the formation of [Pt(terdentate)(L)]n+ complexes with high ΦP.187–190 Moreover, as discussed in Section 2.3.5, this kind of multinuclear Pt(II) complexes might exhibit strong intramolecular metal–metal interactions, which represent another effective strategy for the design of NIR phosphorescent transition-metal complexes. Fig. 23  Chemical structures of bpy and some terdentate ligands. 3.3 Tetradentate ligandTetradentate ligands (Fig. 24), acting as chelating reagents, can react with many metal ions and result in stable metal complexes. For example, robust porphyrins and metalloporphyrins are highly luminescent with varying electronic structures and interesting excited-state properties for applications in phosphorescent LEDs,77,191–193 field-effect transistors (FETs),194–198 sensors,38,199–201 and PVCs.202 With more planar geometry than porphyrins, phthalocyanines (Pc) and metallophthalocyanines have big π–π stacks and strong absorption with less emission, making them suitable for the applications in FETs203,204 and PVCs.41,202,205 With the exception of Pc complexes, the Pt(II) complexes with the terdentate ligands of 2,2′:6′,2′′:6′′,2′′′-quaterpyridine (qtpy),206N,N-bis(salicylidene)-1,2-ethylenediamine (Salen),126,133,207–209 and porphyrin77,191–193 usually are highly phosphorescent, like Pt(II) complexes with the terdentate cyclometalated ligands. Furthermore, extending the π-conjugated system of porphyrin ligands in Pt(II) complexes represents an efficient way to achieve NIR phosphorescence, as discussed in Section 4.7.3. Fig. 24  Chemical structures of some tetradentate ligands. 4. Classification according to the central metal atom4.1 Cr(III) complexesThere are several comprehensive reviews detailing the photophysics and photochemistry of Cr(III) complexes.210–213 Their phosphorescence (2E → 4A2) is predominantly restricted to the red and NIR spectral region, due to the small excited-ground state energy gaps in the first row transition-metal complexes. Like [Ru(bpy)3]2+ complex, [Cr(bpy)3]3+ (Cr1) and its analogous complexes are the most investigated system among the Cr(III) complexes.214–220 For example, [Cr(phen)3]3+ (Cr2) emits NIR phosphorescence (λem = 730 nm) and can oxidize the guanine base of DNA, resulting in phosphorescence quenching, as shown in Fig. 25. Since guanine oxidation has been shown to serve as a genesis point for DNA strand scission, these Cr(III) complexes show potential as a new class of DNA photocleavage agents (photonucleases) (Fig. 26).213,221 Fig. 25  Steady-state emission spectrum of an air-saturated 3.3 × 10−5 M solution of Cr2 in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.1) in the presence of different concentrations of calf thymus B-DNA (wavelength of excitation = 320 nm) (adapted from ref. 219).

Table 1 summarizes the photophysical properties of some NIR phosphorescent Cr(III) complexes (Cr1–Cr32) [Cr3 = [Cr(4,4Ph2bpy)3]3+ (4,4Ph2bpy = 4,4′-diphenyl-2,2′-bipyridine), Cr4 = [Cr(4,4Me2bpy)3]3+ (4,4Me2bpy = 4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine), Cr5 = [Cr(5Clphen)3]3+ (5Clphen = 5-chloro-1,10-phenanthroline), Cr6 = [Cr(4,7Me2phen)3]3+ (4,7Me2phen = 4,7-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline), Cr7 = [Cr(4,7Ph2phen)3]3+, Cr8 = [Cr(3,4,7,8Me4phen)3]3+ (3,4,7,8Me4phen = 3,4,7,8-tetramethyl-1,10-phenanthroline), Cr9 = [Cr(tpy)2]3+, Cr10 = [Cr(phen)(bpy)2]3+, Cr11 = [Cr(phen)2(bpy)]3+, Cr12 = [Cr(phen)(3,4,7,8Me4phen)2]3+, Cr13 = [Cr(phen)2(3,4,7,8Me4phen)]3+, Cr14 = [Cr(phen)2(DPPZ)]3+ (DPPZ = dipyridophenazine), Cr15 = [trans-Cr(en)2(SCN)2]+, Cr16 = [trans-Cr(en)2(NH3)(SCN)]2+, Cr17 = [trans-Cr(en)2(F)2]+, Cr18 = [trans-Cr(en)2(SCN)(F)]+, Cr19 = [Cr(en)3]3+, Cr20 = [trans-Cr(NH3)4(SCN)2]+, Cr21 = [trans-Cr(en)2(NH3)(F)]2+, Cr22 = [Cr(NH3)5(SCN)]2+, Cr23 = [cis-Cr(NH3)4(SCN)2]+, Cr24 = [trans-Cr(NH3)4(SCN)(F)]+, Cr25 = [cis-Cr(en)2(NH3)(F)]2+, Cr26 = [trans-Cr(NH3)2(SCN)4]−, Cr27 = [cis-Cr(en)2(CN)2]+, Cr28 = [trans-Cr(en)2(NH3)(Cl)]2+, Cr29 = [Cr(NH3)5(F)]2+, Cr30 = [Cr(SCN)6]3−, Cr31 = [cis-Cr(en)2(NH3)(Cl)]2+, Cr32 = [Cr(CN)6]3−] at RT. Due to non-radiative decay processes, including intersystem crossing to the ground state, or back intersystem crossing to the 4T2 state,213,218 the phosphorescent quantum efficiencies for most of these complexes are too low (<10−3) for practical applications. However, it is noteworthy that while photodamage in the analogous Ru(II) cases is dramatically decreased in the absence of O2 (consistent with a singlet O2 pathway), photodamage by Cr2 is considerably greater under a N2 atmosphere. Since many cancer cells are hypoxic, the increase in photodamage at lower O2 levels may provide a selectivity advantage for these [Cr(diimine)3]3+ reagents in terms of their future potential as phototherapeutic agents.213 Therefore, there is ample room for the further development of these [Cr(N⁁N)3]3+ complexes.

Copper complexes, in which the copper ion has two common oxidation states: Cu+ (d10) and Cu2+ (d9), have attracted significant attention considering their high relative abundance, low cost, and nontoxic properties compared to noble metal complexes. Clearly, the complete filling of d orbitals prevents MC d–d electronic transitions in Cu(I) complexes. Such transitions are available to d9 Cu(II) complexes, however, and they are deactivated via ultrafast non-radiative processes. Accordingly, the most luminescent Cu complexes are not Cu(II) complexes but Cu(I) complexes.37,76 The coordination behavior of Cu(I) complexes is strictly related to its electronic configuration. The complete filling of d orbitals (d10 configuration) leads to a symmetric localization of the electronic charge, which favors a tetrahedral disposition of the ligands around the metal center in order to locate the coordinative sites far from one another and minimize electrostatic repulsions (Fig. 27). However, these four-coordinated Cu(I) complexes readily suffer a Jahn–Teller based distortion (flattening) in the excited state, and consequent formation of a five-coordinated exciplex, which promotes nonradiative decay (Fig. 27).222 Therefore, luminescent Cu(I) complexes, [Cu(N⁁N)2]+223–228 or [Cu(N⁁N)(P⁁P)]+228–232 complexes, usually have sterically bulky substituents on the ligands to avoid this distortion. As a result, some [Cu(N⁁N)2]+ (Cu1–Cu11)223–225,227 and [Cu(N⁁N)(P⁁P)]+ (Cu12)228 complexes emit weak NIR phosphorescence (3MLCT, ΦP < 10−2) at RT (Fig. 28 and Table 2). Recently, changing the geometry of Cu(I) complexes from four-coordinated into three-coordinated configuration was demonstrated to be an alternative strategy to solve the problem of distortion.233–235 Fig. 27  Flattening distortion and subsequent nucleophilic attack by solvent, counterion, or other molecules following light excitation in Cu(I) complexes.

A remarkable feature of the molecular structures of multinuclear d10 metal complexes, such as Cu(I) complexes, is the observation of short metal–metal distances. Theoretically, in the absence of (n + 1)s and (n + 1)p functions, interactions between the closed-shell d10 centres are repulsive in nature. However, configuration mixing of the filled nd-orbitals with the empty orbitals derived from higher energy (n + 1)s and (n + 1)p orbitals has been proposed to establish some weak metal–metal interactions.39 The clusters of Cu(I) complexes, especially cubane-like [Cu4(X)4(L)4] clusters,250 have attracted considerable interest because of their dual emission and long phosphorescent τ.251–254There are several examples of NIR phosphorescent [Cu4(X)4(L)4] clusters (Cu16–Cu22)255,256 (Fig. 30 and Table 2) reported by Ford et al. X-Ray crystallography shows that these complexes have a “cubane” Cu4I4 core with a single pyridine (py) bound to each Cu and short Cu–Cu distances (ave. 2.69 Å) despite the absence of formal covalent bonding between these d10 centers in the ground state.257 Interestingly, some of these clusters show a phenomenon of “luminescence thermochromism”. As an example, for Cu16 at high temperature, the strong low-energy emission (λem = 690 nm) is dominant and assigned to a triplet cluster-centered (3CC) transition with the combination of iodide to copper charge transfer (3XMCT) and d–s transitions. At low temperature, however, this emission is replaced by the weak high-energy band (λem = 480 nm), assigned to a triplet halide to ligand charge transfer (3XLCT) (Fig. 30).250 Thus, lowering the temperature leads to dramatic changes in the luminescence color, which even can be detected with the naked eyes and is useful for rapid visual thermal sensing. When the aromatic amine ligand pyridine is replaced by the aliphatic piperidine (Cu21) or morpholine (Cu22), the corresponding cluster preserves the low-energy 3CC emission but lacks the high-energy 3XLCT emission owing to the absence of ligands possessing π orbitals. Fig. 30  Chemical structures of some NIR phosphorescent tetrahedral Cu(I) complexes (Cu16–Cu21) and temperature dependence of the emission spectra of Cu16 in toluene (adapted from ref. 255). In addition to cubane-like tetrahedral Cu(I) complexes, Yam et al. described a series of novel saddle-like tetranuclear Cu(I)-phosphinidene complexes, [Cu4(dppm)4(S)]2+,258 [Cu4(dppm)4(Se)]2+,259 and [Cu4(dppm)4(PPh)]2+260 (Cu23) (Fig. 31), which emit intense long-lived yellow-orange, orange-red, and NIR luminescence, respectively, originating predominantly from the LMCT with mixing of a MC (d–s/d–p) state. Such an assignment is consistent with the trend observed in the luminescence energy with S2− > Se2− > PPh2− and Ag(I) > Cu(I).57 It should be noted that the Cu–Cu distances in these tetrahedral Cu(I)–phosphinidene complexes range from 2.82 to 3.44 Å, resulting in no significant Cu–Cu interactions. Another type of NIR phosphorescent tetranuclear Cu(I) alkynyl complexes (Cu24–Cu31)261 (Fig. 31) with an “open-cube” structure and Cu–Cu distances of 2.46–2.48 Å were reported by the same group. The alkynyl group has many advantages, such as the linear geometry, structural rigidity, extended π-electron delocalization, π-unsaturated nature, and ability to interact with metal centers via pπ–dπ overlap, for building blocks in the construction of carbon-rich metal-containing optical materials. At RT, like [Cu4(X)4(L)4] clusters, most of these complexes, in solid state, displayed dual emission behavior with high-energy emission (443 < λem < 541 nm) and low-energy emission (623 < λem < 665 nm), originating from the IL π–π* (alkynyl ligand)/MLCT [Cu → π*(RCC)] and the LMCT [RCC → Cu4]/Cu(I)-centered d–s/d–p characters, respectively. In contrast, all of the open-cube complexes in solution exhibit only a single structure-less emission band centered at 665–700 nm (Table 2), which is red shifted compared to the solid-state samples of the respective complexes due to the presence of rigidochromism effects. Fig. 31  Perspective view of Cu23 with atomic numbering scheme (the phenyl rings of the dppm ligand are omitted for clarity) and chemical structures of some NIR phosphorescent tetranuclear Cu(I) alkynyl complexes (Cu24–Cu31). In addition to tetranuclear Cu(I) complexes, NIR phosphorescent dinuclear (Cu32–Cu34),262–264 hexanuclear (Cu35–Cu37),265,266 and polymeric (Cu38 and Cu39)264,267 Cu(I) complexes (Fig. 32) are reported. An interesting report264 by Tsuge et al. demonstrated with a series of insoluble Cu(I) complexes, formulated as [Cu2(X)2(PPh3)(L)n] (X = Br or I and L = N-heteroaromatic ligands), that their strong emissions can be finely tuned from blue to red and NIR (Cu34 and Cu38) region (Fig. 33). The emission is attributed to 3MLCT, because there are no strong Cu–Cu interactions (2.87–3.30 Å). Moreover, since the effects of bridging halides are smaller than those of N-heteroaromatic ligands, the energy of the emission can be varied by increasing the electron-accepting character of the ligand L. Recently, Hong et al. prepared two hexanuclear Cu(I) clusters [(Cu6(4-ptt)6]·3DMF·3H2O (Cu36) and [(Cu6(4-ptt)6]·8DMF·7H2O (Cu37)266 [4-Hptt = 5-(pyridin-4-yl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiol, DMF = N,N′-dimethylformamide] by the differing reaction temperatures. The Cu6S6 units in Cu36 pack in a polydirectional array, while they extend in one direction in Cu37. Their varied Cu–Cu interactions (Cu36: 2.85–3.08 Å, Cu37: 3.13–3.32 Å) and individual packing modes cause differences in luminescent and thermostable behaviors. Cu36 exhibits an unusually long wavelength at 904 nm and a higher thermal stability; while the emission (λem = 776 nm) of Cu37, like [Cu4(X)4(L)4] clusters, splits into two bands (λem = 589 and 871 nm) as the temperature decreases. Therefore, the emission of Cu36 originates from a 3CC transition, and that of Cu37 comes from a mixture of 3CC and 3MLCT.

Fig. 33  Emission spectra of [Cu2(X)2(PPh3)(L)n] complexes in solid at RT: dmap = N,N-dimethyl-4-aminopyridine, 4,4bpy = 4,4′-bipyridine, 1,6-nap = 1,6-naphthyridine, and pyz = pyrazine (adapted from ref. 264). Table 2 summarizes the photophysical properties of some NIR phosphorescent Cu(I) complexes at RT. As one of first row transition metals, copper exerts a negligible heavy atom effect and the resulting complexes usually have too low phosphorescent quantum efficiency or too low solubility for practical applications. Nonetheless, the need for abundant, cheap, and environmentally friendly smart materials makes copper compounds an attractive alternative to more traditional choices based on precious metals. The current trends in literature indeed suggest that Cu(I) complexes are attracting increasing attention for technological applications (e.g., OLEDs),76,235,253 although we are still at the level of prototypes and proof-of-principle, further important breakthroughs may be anticipated in the years to come.4.3 Re(I) and Re(III) complexes4.3.1 Re(I) complexes. Among d6 Re(I) complexes, tricarbonylRe(I) diimine complexes268 of the type [Re(N⁁N)(CO)3(L)]n+ (N⁁N = diimine ligand, L = monodentate ligand and n = 0 or 1) are the best studied and are known to exhibit RT phosphorescence, which is highly sensitive to the nature of the environment and can be used as photoswitchable materials, chemical probes and photocleavage agents.269–271 Most of their emission spectra are often found to occur near 600 nm and are structure-less and assignable to a 3MLCT state, because carbonyl ligands undergo significant π back-bonding with the metal-centre. Consequently, the energy gap between the metal d orbitals and the π* ligand orbitals involved in the 3MLCT transition is small enough for acting as low-energy emission. Their quantum yields are typically small (∼10−3) compared with complexes of the later transition metals. Nonetheless, some [Re(N⁁N)(CO)3(CNR)]+ (N⁁N = bpy or phen, R = t-Bu or n-alkyl) exhibit exceptionally high ΦP (> 0.7) and long τ (>100 μs) in fluid solutions at RT.272 This series of complexes is particularly interesting as their emission wavelengths are centred in the 450–500 nm region with strong vibronic character, consistent with the diimine ligand emission. Since the emission envelope of the coordinated diimine ligand is red-shifted from that of the free ligand, a combination of 3ILCT (3π–π* diimine) and 3MLCT state is often employed to account for the emission behavior. After that, much attention has been focused on improving their RT phosphorescence and thermal and photochemical stability for the applications in OLEDs, TTAU, and charge transfer.273–278Meyer et al. succeeded in tuning the emission band of the “parent complexes” [Re(bpy)(CO)3(Cl)] [λem = 642 nm in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MeTHF)] by the introduction of electron-donating [e.g., –NH2 (λem = 575 nm), –NEt2 (λem = 573 nm), –NHCOMe (λem = 620 nm), –OMe (λem = 630 nm), or –Me (λem = 626 nm)] and electron-withdrawing [e.g., –Ph (λem = 647 nm), –Cl (Re1) (λem = 700 nm), –CO2Et (Re2) (λem = 715 nm), or –NO2 (Re3) (λem = 780 nm)] substituents onto the 4,4′-positions of bpy ligand (Fig. 34 and Table 3).279 Yam and co-workers demonstrated two [Re(bpy)(CO)3(Cl)] derivatives (Re4 and Re5),280 equipped with spirooxazine-containing bpy ligands, that emitted strong RT phosphorescence originating form 3dπ(Re) → π*(diimine). Moreover, the emission properties of the complexes could readily be switched by opening the oxazine through photochromic reactions. W. K. Chan et al. also reported a series of NIR phosphorescent [Re(N⁁N)(CO)3(Cl)] (Re6–Re16)273,281,282 complexes and polymers for photovoltaic and light-emitting applications, but the EQEs of the resulting OLEDs were found to be low (10−3–10−4).

The introduction of acetylide moieties into the d6 metal diimine system has the added advantage of rendering the metal center more electron rich, thus raising the energy of the d–d states, which improves the population of the MLCT state. The addition of one –CC– unit leads to a red shift of the transition energies of ca. 0.24 eV. Interestingly, when Re22 with the –CC–CC– unit is excited at 350–400 nm, a long-lived luminescence at ca. 660–690 nm results, probably 3MLCT [dπ(Re) → π*(t-Bu2bpy)] in origin. If the same complex is excited at ≥450 nm, an exceptionally lower lying emission at ca. 750 nm appears and is contributed to 3MLCT [dπ(Re) → π*(CC–CC–Re)] or 3LLCT [π(CC–CC–Re) → π*(t-Bu2bpy)]. Moreover, the introduction of a triarylboron moiety to alkynylRe(I) tricarbonyl diimine complexes (Re23–Re25)285 allows for the binding of F− ions with resulting spectral changes in the UV-vis absorption and emission spectra (Fig. 36); such complexes may find interesting applications in the design of spectrochemical and luminescence chemosensors. The further work of the same group reveals that the –Cl in the [Re(N⁁N)(CO)3(Cl)] complexes can be replaced by pyridinyl derivatives (Re26 and Re27),286 as depicted in Fig. 35. Addition of alkali-metal or alkaline-earth-metal ions to a MeOH solution of Re27 results in a blue shift of the absorption band from 410 to 380 nm, indicating the binding of the cations to the polyether cavity. In addition to bipyridin ligand, other N⁁N ligands, such as dipyrrin ligands, are used to synthesize NIR phosphorescent (λem = 688–711 nm) Re(I) complexes (Re28–Re34),287 in which one of three CO groups can be further replaced by PPh3 or PBu3 group, but resulting in much lower emissive complexes.

Hexanuclear Re(III) chalcohalide clusters can serve as promising “building blocks” for the creation of new porous frameworks, nanoparticles and mesoporous materials. Because of the controllable architectures and multianchoring sites of clusters together with their photoluminescence, Re(III) cluster complexes are promising potential candidates as catalysts, chemical color sensors, magnetic materials, gas storage materials, optoelectronic, diagnostic agents, and gene/drug carriers.288–290 In 1999, three research groups including Sasaki,291,292 Nocera,293 and Batail294 reported independently that 24-electron [Re6(Q)8(X)6]z clusters (Re35–Re51) (Q = S2−, Se2−, or Te2−, L = Cl−, Br−, I− CN−, PEt3, MeCN, DMF, or pyridine, [Re6(S)8(Cl)6]4− = Re35, [Re6(S)8(Br)6]4− = Re36, [Re6(S)8(I)6]4− = Re37, [Re6(S)8(PEt3)6]2+ = Re38, [Re6(Se)8(MeCN)6]2+ = Re39, [Re6(Se)8(py)6]2+ = Re40, [Re6(Se)8(DMF)6]2+ = Re41, trans-[Re6(Se)8(PEt3)4(I)2] = Re42, cis-[Re6(Se)8(PEt3)4(I)2] = Re43, [Re6(Se)8(PEt3)5(I)]+ = Re44, [Re6(Se)8(PEt3)5(Br)]+ = Re45, trans-[Re6(S)8(PEt3)4(Br)2] = Re46, cis-[Re6(S)8(PEt3)4(Br)2] = Re47, mer-[Re6(S)8(PEt3)3(Br)3]− = Re48, [Re6(S)8(CN)6]4− = Re49, [Re6(Se)8(CN)6]4− = Re50, and [Re6(Te)8(CN)6]4− = Re51) as well as the paramagnetic 23-electron cluster trianion [Re6S8Cl6]3− (Re52) (Fig. 37) show RT NIR phosphorescence both in solution and crystalline phases with τ and ΦP up to 18.9 μs and 0.203, respectively. As shown in Fig. 38, the absorption and emission spectra of [Re6(S)8(X)6]4− [X = Cl− (Re35), Br− (Re36), or I− (Re37)] exhibit red shift along the series Cl < Br < I, which agrees with ligand-to-cluster ([Re6(Q)8]2+) charge transfer (LCCT).295 Since then many other σ-donor ligands have been used to develop new NIR phosphorescent hexanuclear Re(III) clusters, such as (trans-[Re6(Se)8(PEt3)4(CN)2] (Re53), [Re6(Se)8(PEt3)5(CN)]+ (Re54), trans-[Re6(Se)8(PEt3)4(MeCN)2]2+ (Re55), [Re6(Se)8(PEt3)5(MeCN)]+ (Re56), [Re6(Se)8(PEt3)4(DMSO)2]2+ (Re57), [Re12Se16(PEt3)10(μ-4,4bpy)]4+ (Re58),295trans-[Re6(S)8(Cl)4(pyz)2]2− (Re59), cis-[Re6(S)8(Cl)4(pyz)2]2− (Re60), trans-[Re6(S)8(Cl)4(4,4bpy)2]2− (Re61), cis-[Re6(S)8(Cl)4(4,4bpy)2]2− (Re62), trans-[Re6(S)8(Cl)4(py)2]2− (Re63), cis-[Re6(S)8(Cl)4(py)2]2− (Re64), mer-[Re6(S)8(Cl)3(py)3]2− (Re65), trans-[Re6(S)8(Cl)4(4Mepy)2]2− (Re66) (4Mepy = 4-methylpyridine), cis-[Re6(S)8(Cl)4(4(Me2N)py)2]2− (Re67) (4(Me2N)py = 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine),296 [Re6(Se)8(I)4(μ-dpph)]2− (Re68) (dpph = PPh2(CH2)6PPh2), trans-[Re6(Se)8(I)2(μ-dpph)2] (Re69), cis-[Re6(Se)8(I)2(μ-dpph)2] (Re70), [Re6(Se)8(μ-dpph)3]2+ (Re71),297 [Re6(S)8(NCS)6]4− (Re72), and [Re6(Se)8(NCS)6]4− (Re73).298 Further studies showed that the Q of the [Re6(Q)8]2+ core also can be replaced by Br− to obtain chalcobromide-capped clusters including fac-[Re6(S7Br)(PPh3)3(Br)3] (Re74), fac-[Re6(Se7Br)(PPh3)3(Br)3] (Re75),299 [Re6(Se7Br)(Br)6]3− (Re76), D3d-[Re6(Se6Br2)(Br)6]2− (Re77), C2v-[Re6(Se6Br2)(Br)6]2− (Re78), [Re6(Se5Br3)(Br)6]− (Re79), [Re6(S7Br)(Br)6]3− (Re80), D3d-[Re6(S6Br2)(Br)6]2− (Re81) and C2v-[Re6(S6Br2)(Br)6]2− (Re82),300 which emit NIR phosphorescence with λem up to 968 nm (Table 3).

Fig. 38  Absorption and emission spectra of [Re6(S)8(X)6]4− clusters [X=Cl− (Re35), Br− (Re36), or I− (Re37)] in dichloromethane at RT (adapted from ref. 295). Table 3 summarizes the photophysical properties of some NIR phosphorescent Re(I) and Re(III) complexes at RT. Re(I) complexes usually possess low quantum yields (∼10−3), which limits their applications as NIR luminophores. Re(III) cluster complexes constitute a kind of very promising luminophore candidate for biotechnology applications because they are nanosized entities offering robust NIR phosphorescence. However, they cannot be used directly for biological applications because of potential toxic effects and quenching of the clusters' luminescence in aqueous media. Therefore, some Re(III) cluster complexes, such as [Re6(Se)8(4-t-butylpyridine)4(methacrylic acid)2] (Re83), [Re6(S)8(OH)6]4− (Re84), [Re6(Se)8(OH)6]4− (Re85), [Re6(S)8(CN)4(OH)2]4− (Re86), and [Re6(S)8(Br)6]4− (Re87), need to be dispersed in a biocompatible matrix such as poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)301 or SiO2 nanoparticles,302 resulting in highly NIR luminescent transparent pellets or aqueous solutions (Fig. 39); such formulations have a bright future for multiple applications.

Studies into the photochemistry and photophysics of Ru(II) complexes have undergone an impressive growth in the last few decades. The prototype complex [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (λem = 606 nm, ΦP = 0.062, τ = 870 ns in degassed MeCN) or [Ru(phen)3]2+ (λem = 587 nm, ΦP = 0.023, τ = 340 ns in degassed EtOH) has certainly been one of the molecules most extensively studied and widely used in research laboratories during the last 30 years.60–64 As discussed in Section 3.1, phosphorescence (ΦP < 0.1, τ < 10 μs) is frequently detected in RT fluid solution from these complexes and is attributed to low-lying 3MLCT excited states. Since the ligand field splitting of the Ru(II) complexes has an intermediate value between the Fe(II) (non-emissive) and Os(II)/Ir(III) (highly emissive) cases, the MC levels of Ru(II) complexes that are thermally accessible contribute to deactivation of the MLCT emissive level, resulting in ΦP < 0.1. Ligand tuning is largely ineffective and emission wavelengths are generally restricted to the orange–red spectral region. In order to red shift the emission of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ or [Ru(phen)3]2+ into the NIR region, electron-withdrawing groups, –CO2R (R = –H,303 –Me, –C2H5, or –CH2Ph304) or –CN,305 or electron-donating groups, –NEt2,306 –CC–Ph,307–309 or polythiophene,310 must be introduced on the bpy or phen ligand (Ru1–Ru13) (Fig. 40 and Table 4). The noteworthy example from Zhao's group, Ru11, has a very long τ of 58.4 μs, which does not originate from 3MLCT, but 3IL/3LLCT (vide infra) and has an excellent performance in oxygen sensing (improved by 150 fold over [Ru(bpy)2(phen)]2+) and TTAU (upconversion quantum yield = 0.096) (Fig. 41).308,309 In addition to bpy and phen ligands, some other N⁁N,311–314 C⁁N,315 or P313 ligands (Fig. 42) are also used to prepare mononuclear or multinuclear Ru(II) complexes (Ru14–Ru34). Nonetheless, these complexes have too low ΦP values for applications (Table 4). For example, Ru27314 can be used in LECs to emit NIR phosphorescence at λem = 945 nm with a low efficiency of 3 × 10−4.

Fig. 42  Chemical structures of some NIR phosphorescent Ru(II) complexes (Ru14–Ru40). Although some Ru(II) complexes with carboxylated bipyridine (Ru1 and Ru35–Ru40316) or multipyridine ligands (see Section 4.4.2) usually have low NIR ΦP at RT (Table 4), they can be chemically anchored onto TiO2 nanoparticles by carboxyl groups and have shown the best photovoltaic properties: a broad absorption spectrum in visible and NIR region, suitable excited and ground state energy levels, relatively long excited-state lifetimes, and good electrochemical stability. Several Ru(II) bipyridine complexes including Ru4053,61 (called N3 or “red dye”) used in DSSCs have reached more than 10% overall conversion efficiency under standard measurement conditions.4.4.2 Ru(II) complexes with terdentate or tetradentate ligands. As discussed in Section 3.2, the tridentate tpy-type ligands offer several synthetic and structural advantages compared to the bidentate bpy-type ligands, but [Ru(tpy)2]2+ (non-emissive, τ = 250 ps measured by transient absorption spectroscopy) exhibits less favourable photophysical properties (in particular, lack of luminescence and very short excited state lifetime at RT) than [Ru(bpy)3]2+.317 Many efforts have been devoted to the design and synthesis of terdentate polypyridine ligands to improve the photophysical properties of resultant Ru(II) complexes. The typical approach is to take advantage of the substituent effects for tuning the energy gap of 3MLCT and 3MC states, which involves the insertion of judiciously selected heterocyclic substituents onto the tpy chelate. Increasing the ligand bite angle also can be attempted to make the complex adopt a less distorted octahedral arrangement and hence increase the ligand field strength and reduce the nonradiative decay. As an example of substituent effects, the presence of electron-withdrawing or -donating substituents on tpy leads to a red shift in emission into the NIR region (Ru41–Ru48)318 (Fig. 43 and Table 4); this results from a destabilization of the metal-based HOMO to a greater extent than the ligand-based LUMO. Moreover, electron-withdrawing substituents increase the luminescence quantum yield and the excited state lifetime, whereas electron-donating substituents have an opposite effect because the electron-donating substituents do not destabilise the 3MC state to a great extent and nonradiative decay back to the ground state is facilitated. Acetylene substituents also can be used to tune photophysical properties of [Ru(tpy)2]2+-type complexes (Ru49–Ru53).317 The acetylene groups grafted directly onto the terpyridine core can enhance electron delocalisation and stabilise the ligand-based LUMO, resulting in an increase in the energy gap between 3MLCT and 3MC and a subsequent reduction in the mixing of the 3MLCT state with the 3MC state. Moreover, an increase in the number of acetylene units was found to decrease the emission energy and increase the excited state lifetime (Ru50: λem = 690 nm, τ = 55 ns; Ru51: λem = 710 nm, τ = 170 ns). An alternative approach to prolong the lifetime of [Ru(tpy)2]2+-type complexes was achieved by the introduction of electron-withdrawing pyrimidine groups (Ru54–Ru66)319–321 onto tpy ligands. Unlike phenyl groups, pyrimidine groups can act as coplanar substituents through intramolecular hydrogen bonding to enhance electron delocalization in the ligand and enlarge the energy gap between 3MLCT and 3MC, resulting in relatively long τ for Ru63320 (τ = 1.81 μs). Fig. 43  Chemical structures of some NIR phosphorescent Ru(II) complexes (Ru41–Ru82). Since most [Ru(tpy)2]2+-type complexes (Ru41–Ru61) usually have low ΦP or short τ at RT, many other N⁁N⁁N ligands, such as 2,6-bis(8′-quinolinyl)pyridine (bqp) (Ru67–Ru70),322,323 2-phenyl-4,6-dipyridin-2-yl-1,3,5-triazine (trz) (Ru71 and Ru72),324 2,4-di(pyridin-2-yl)pyrimidine (dpyp) (Ru73 and Ru74),325 and bpy-X-pyrazole (X = CH2 or CO) (Ru75–Ru77),326 or NCS ligands (Ru78–Ru82)327 are used to prepare NIR phosphorescent Ru(II) complexes (Fig. 43). Remarkably, Ru67322 with bqp ligand exhibits near octahedral structure and demonstrates the best photophysical properties (λem = 700 nm, ΦP = 0.02, τ = 3.0 μs) reported up to now among the bis-tridentate Ru(II) polypyridine complex. The capability of the bqp ligand to form double hexagonal metallacycles is a likely explanation as this could relieve the structural distortion from the ideal octahedral geometry upon excitation. The further work in the same group of Hammarstrom reveals that the presence of electron-withdrawing –CO2Et substituents in Ru68323 can improve ΦP and τ up to 0.07 and 5.5 μs, respectively. The NIR EL of Ru71 and Ru72324 is observed at λEL = 717 and 725 nm, respectively, but the EQE, around 0.005% in both LECs, is very low. Ru80327 (called N719 or “black dye”) with tpy ligand has a broader absorption in the NIR region than Ru40 with bpy ligand, resulting in an overall conversion efficiency of 10.4% for Ru80-based DSSCs.Multinuclear or heteronuclear Ru(II) complexes containing N⁁N⁁N ligands that can absorb and emit light in the NIR region are the subject of intensive research in many fields, especially in photoactive molecular-scale wires or supermolecules.60,63,328 For example, [Ru(tpy)2]2+ units can be spaced by acetylide and/or [Zn(tpy)2]2+ (Ru83–Ru88)328 (Fig. 44) to emit NIR emission with τ up to 720 ns. A recent report reveals that the emission from “molecular wires” of Ru89–Ru92329 can be tuned at λem = 758, 1040, 1052, and 1078 nm, respectively, which agrees with the increase of nuclearity from two to six. However, these multinuclear or heteronuclear Ru(II) complexes generally have very low ΦP values and will not be discussed further in this review. Interested readers should consult some available reviews60,63,328 to obtain in-depth mechanistic discussions and information on multinuclear or heteronuclear Ru(II) complexes. Fig. 44  Chemical structures of some NIR phosphorescent Ru(II) complexes (Ru83–Ru92). Emissive Ru(II) complexes containing tetradentate ligands are rare because presumably Ru(II) complexes with tetradentate ligands, such as qtpy, have a highly distorted octahedral structure. For example, [Ru(N⁁N⁁N⁁N)(X)2] (X = –Cl or –NCS) complexes (Ru93–Ru99)330 (Fig. 45) show weak and broad emission signals with onset at above 952 nm, but they have broad absorption in the visible and NIR region and are suitable for the application in DSSCs. It is worth noting that complexes Ru93–Ru94, which contain π-extended ligands, are very weakly soluble in common organic solvents such as MeCN, MeOH, EtOH, and CH2Cl2 and only partially soluble in DMF and DMSO for the measurements of nuclear magnetic resonance, cyclic voltammetry, and electronic spectral properties. Therefore, the problem of solubility must be carefully considered when adopting the π-extended ligands. Fig. 45  Chemical structures of some NIR phosphorescent Ru(II) complexes (Ru93–Ru99). Table 4 lists the photophysical properties of some NIR phosphorescent Ru(II) complexes at RT. Their rich photophysical properties make them attractive candidates for applications as photosensitisers and emitters in DSSCs and LECs, respectively. To date, one of the “brightest” NIR phosphorescent Ru(II) polypyridine complexes, Ru68, has a ΦP, λem, and τ of 0.07, 693 nm, and 5.5 μs, respectively. Therefore, the classical Ru(II) polypyridine complexes need rebirth as NIR phosphorescent emitter. New emissive Ru(II) complexes with new transitions other than 3MLCT, like Ru11, are eagerly expected.4.5 Os(II) complexesPolypyridine d6 Os(II) complexes possess similar photophysical behavior with d6 Ru(II) complexes and they have been thoroughly investigated since the 1980s.331–334 The relationship between the photophysics of Ru(II) diimine and Os(II) diimine complexes illustrates that the emissive excited state is Os to diimine 3MLCT in character. The luminescence of Os(II) complexes is generally of lower energy than that of the related Ru(II) complexes, in part due to the significantly more negative one-electron oxidation potential of the Os(II) complexes. Moreover, the excited state lifetimes of Os(II) diimines are generally shorter than those of the corresponding Ru(II) complexes, which can be explained by the SOC effect and energy gap law.335 For example, [Os(bpy)3]2+ (Os1) has a longer λem and shorter τ of 740 nm and 49 ns, respectively, compared with [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (λem = 606 nm, τ = 870 ns). However, it was demonstrated that the incorporation of strong π- accepting ligands, such as phosphine, arsine,336–339 or carbonyl,340,341 in combination with polypyridyl ligands can improve the τ and ΦP up to tens of microseconds and 0.76, respectively, in the visible region at RT. In these complexes, the 3MLCT and/or 3π–π* ILCT states are responsible for extended τ and improved ΦP. High-performance OLEDs based on these complexes have also been successfully demonstrated.62,64,3394.5.1 Os(II) complexes with bidentate ligands. Since the emission energy of Os(II) complexes is lower than that of the corresponding Ru(II) complexes, a number of studies have been done to seek Os(II) complexes that absorb throughout the visible (black chromophores) and have NIR emission. Some simple Os (II) diimine complexes, such as Os1,337 [trans-Os(bpy)2(PPh3)2]2+ (Os2), [trans-Os(bpy)2(PPh2Me)2]2+ (Os3), [trans-Os(bpy)2(diars)2]2+ (Os4) [diars = 1,2-bis(dimethylarsino)benzene], [Os(bpy)2(CO)(Cl)]+ (Os5), [Os(bpy)2(MeCN)2]2+ (Os6), [Os(bpy)2(pyz)2]2+ (Os7), [Os(bpy)2(py)2]2+ (Os8), [Os(phen)3]2+ (Os9), [trans-Os(phen)2(PPhMe2)2]2+ (Os10), [Os(phen)2(MeCN)2]2+ (Os11), [Os(phen)2(CO)(Cl)]+ (Os12), [Os(phen)2(py)2]2+ (Os13), and [Os(phen)(py)4]2+ (Os14),337 emit RT phosphorescence in the NIR region (Table 5). Among these complexes, Os2–Os4 and Os10, which possess strong π-acid ligands of phosphine or arsine, show blue-shifted emission bands and higher ΦP values up to 0.10,337 in accordance with the energy gap law. On the other hand, the emission spectra can be red shifted up to 1270 nm via the introduction of carboxyl groups to the bpy ligand (Os15 and Os16),342 phenylethynyl group to the phen ligand (Os17 and Os18),343 π-extended ligands, such as dpb ligand ([Os(bpy)2(dpb)]2+ (Os19))312 and eilatin ligands (Os20–Os24),344–346 or imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid ligand (Os25 and Os26)347 (Fig. 46). Upon the deprotonation of NH and CO2H moieties of Os25, the redox potentials of the Os(II)/Os(III) couple are significantly reduced and in consonance with this, the 3MLCT absorption and emission bands are significantly shifted to higher wavelengths, indicating that Os25 has potentially application as a NIR phosphorescent pH probe (Fig. 47).

Fig. 47  Changes in the emission spectra of Os25 as a function of pH in MeCN–H2O (3:2). Inset: the change of emission intensity from 15 to 2 at 825 nm as a function of pH (adapted from ref. 347). As listed in Table 5, either the ΦP or τ value of these NIR phosphorescent Os(II) complexes (Os1–Os26) is relatively small. Recently, the groups of Chi and Chou have reported some elegant results326,348,349 on neutral NIR phosphorescent Os(II) complexes that exhibit significant photophysical properties for application in luminescence solvatochromism or OLEDs. As shown in Fig. 48, Os27348 bearing two (2-pyridyl)pyrazolate ligands together with one carbonyl and one N-heterocyclic ligand exhibits a strong solvent-polarity-dependent phosphorescence, being shifted for example, from 603 nm (in hexane) to 710 nm (in MeCN). This solvatochromic shift is coincident with the phosphorescence originating from a 3LLCT transition. With the π-extended pytriz ligands, Os28–Os31349 emit significantly stronger lower-energy phosphorescence (3MLCT/3ILCT/3LLCT, ΦP and τ up to 0.15 and 760 ns, respectively) than Os27 and the analogous Ru(II) complexes of Ru29 and Ru30. In sharp contrast to the cis-arranged complexes Os29–Os31, the trans derivative Os28, which shows a planar arrangement of chromophoric N-substituted chelates, offers the most effective extended π-delocalization and hence the lowest excited state energy gap. The Os28-based OLEDs exhibit fairly intense emission with a peak wavelength at 814 nm and EQE of 1.5%. Upon switching to Os31, the EL blue shifts to 718 nm, while the maximum EQE increases to 2.7%. Fig. 48  Chemical structures of some NIR phosphorescent Os(II) complexes (Os27–Os31). 4.5.2 Os(II) complexes with terdentate ligands. It is believed that the MC excited states of Os(II) polypyridine complexes lie at relatively higher energy compared with the corresponding Ru(II) polypyridine complexes. This situation is seen clearly for the metal bis-tpy complexes because [Ru(tpy)2]2+ is nonluminescent but [Os(tpy)2]2+ (Os32)350,351 (Fig. 49) emits with reasonable efficiency in the absence of molecular oxygen at RT. A further advantage of the Os(II) complexes containing terdentate ligands (Os32–Os38) is the availability of relatively strong absorption bands stretching across the NIR region. This latter property is useful for the design of luminescent biolabels and PVCs. For instance, a well known Ru(II) complex of [Ru(bpy)2(dppz)]2+ shows no photoluminescence in aqueous solution at ambient temperature, but displays intense photoluminescence in the presence of double-helical DNA, to which the complex binds avidly.352 A similar nonemissive Os(II) complexes of [Os(phen)2(dppz)]2+ can intercalate into DNA and be used as “DNA NIR light switch”,353 as shown in Fig. 50. With π-extended ligands, Os36354 exhibits a broad absorption in the 550–750 nm region and a relatively strong emission band centered at 800 nm (τ = 50 ns and ΦP = 8 × 10−3). The more important fact is that this complex can be completely quenched by hydrogen bonding in aqueous solution but re-display NIR emission in the presence of a small amount of DNA, behaving as a real Off–On DNA light switch (Fig. 50). Although their emission is relatively weak, Os37 and Os38355 exhibit broader absorption in the visible and NIR regions than their analogous Ru(II) complexes and can act as dyes in DSSCs to achieve an overall conversion efficiency up to 8.9%.

Fig. 50  Emission spectra of [Os(phen)2(dppz)]2+ and Os36 in buffered solution upon successive addition of DNA (adapted from ref. 353 and 354). 4.5.3 Multinuclear Os(II) complexesA significant amount of work has been done on multinuclear or heteronuclear Os(II) imine complexes with a variety of bridging ligands (BL). These complexes are often reported along with mixed metal Ru(II)(BL)Os(II) systems in which energy transfer from the Ru(II) imine complex to the Os(II) complex is examined.335,356 A typical example is from the work of Juris et al. in which a set of complexes (Os39 and Os40)357 (Fig. 51) of this type were prepared using spirohexane linked bis-phenanthrolines as bridging ligands. In these heteronuclear complexes, since efficient intramolecular triplet energy transfer takes place from the Ru(II)-based fragment (λem = ∼615 nm) to the appended Os(II)-based unit (λem = ∼733 nm), only NIR emission from the latter is observed. However, these multinuclear or heteronuclear Ru(II) complexes (Os23, Os24, Os39 and Os40) generally have relatively low ΦP356 and are out of the focus of this review. Fig. 51  Chemical structures of some NIR phosphorescent Os(II) complexes (Os39 and Os40). The emission from Os(II) complexes is generally at lower energy than that from the analogous Ru(II) species, which is conducive to their use as NIR luminophores. As listed in Table 5, to date, the best ΦP of NIR phosphorescent Os(II) complexes can be up to 0.15, but is difficult for τ to exceed 800 ns, corresponding with Fig. 9. Several efforts have been described to achieve longer τ values for Os(II) complexes. Recently, Lemmetyinen and coworkers demonstrated that Os41358 (Fig. 52) containing a triarylamine donor/9,10-anthraquinone acceptor DA system shows a lengthened lifetime of the charge-separated state (τCR) from ∼50 ns in CH2Cl2 to ∼2 μs in hexafluoroisopropanol (a result of hydrogen bonding). Strong hydrogen bonding between the alcoholic solvent and the reduced anthraquinone causes a thermodynamic and kinetic stabilization of these charge-separated states, resulting in a relatively long τCR. This might provide another tactic to achieve long-lived triplet excited states for Os(II) complexes, however, the τCR in this article is not measured by emission decay but transient absorption. Fig. 52  Chemical structure and mechanism of extended τCR for NIR phosphorescent Os(II) complex of Os41 (adapted from ref. 358). 4.6 Ir(III) complexesToday, d6 octahedral Ir(III) complexes containing cyclometalated ligands such as ppy and its derivatives are the most efficient and versatile class of phosphorescent emitters for use in OLEDs, LECs, TTAU, and energy transfer46,70,71,128,359e.g., they feature shorter triplet lifetimes and less triplet–triplet annihilation at high currents compared to Pt(II) species. As a consequence high quantum efficiencies up to ∼100% can be achieved. Strong SOC leads to mixed singlet and triplet MLCT states as well as to mixed triplet ILCT emitting states, which enables an efficient tuning of the emission color by varying the ligands. Accordingly, full-color applications based on phosphorescent Ir(III) complexes can be realized. As mentioned in Section 3.1.2, ppy-based Ir(III) complexes have much stronger emission than bpy-based Ir(III) complexes. Typically, [Ir(ppy)3] (λem = 492 nm, ΦP = 0.40, τ = 3.6 μs)106 emits much stronger 3MLCT emission of than [Ir(bpy)3]3+(λem = 441 nm, τ = 2.4 μs) [The ΦP of Ir(ppy)3 was recently found to be 0.96 and 0.90 in PMMA and CH2Cl2, respectively.56,188] The ΦP of the latter can be further improved by incorporating both ppy- and bpy-type ligands, resulting in highly emissive and color-tunable [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+-type ionic transition-metal complexes (Fig. 12) for the LECs applications.46,1284.6.1 Ir(III) complexes with bidentate ligands. For Ir(III) complexes, it has been demonstrated that expanding the length of π-conjugation in the C⁁N ligand is a much more effective means to lower the emission energy than the effect of substituents and heterocycles in C⁁N ligand. As shown in Fig. 53 and Table 6, the emission energy of the well known ppy-based Ir(III) complexes of [Ir(C⁁N)3] and [Ir(C⁁N)2(acac)] can be lowered into the NIR region(Ir1–Ir10)43,360–363 by expanding the length of π-conjugation in the C⁁N ligands. Especially, Ir743 with the rigid azaperylene ligand gives a marked red shift, emitting at 932 nm. This emission energy is very close to the phosphorescent emission from perylene (800 nm), suggesting that the excited state in this complex is predominantly 3ILCT. Nonetheless, the OLEDs based on these Ir(III) complexes have too low EQE (<1%) for real applications.360–363 Fig. 53  Chemical structures of some NIR phosphorescent Ir(III) complexes (Ir1–Ir10).

For example, dipyrrin and 8-hydroxyquinoline ligands usually have low triplet energy, consequently resulting in their Ir(III) (Ir11–Ir16 and Ir22)364,366 or Pt(II) complexes370 emitting NIR phosphorescence from 3ILCT. Ir17–Ir21 containing π-extended benzoisoquinoline ligands have similar absorption and emission spectra even with different ancillary ligands such as pypz, acac, and bpy, indicating that their transition mainly involves benzoisoquinoline 3π–π* ILCT and metal (Ir) to benzoisoquinoline charge transfer.365 For complex Ir23, a strong red-shifted emission, compared to that of the parent complex [Ir(ppy)2bpy]+ (λem = 580 nm), can be observed at λem = 687 nm; this is attributed to the stabilization of the LUMO by the introduction of the electron withdrawing ester groups onto the bipyridine moiety. The absorption and emission spectra of complex Ir23 and polymer Ir24 are practically the same, indicating that the polymer backbone does not influence the photophysical properties. Moreover, Ir24-based LECs have improved stability and longer emission wavelengths than complex Ir23-based LECs, which can be attributed to a more uniform distribution of the active ionic transition-metal complexes imposed by the chemical linkage to the polymer backbone.367 Like Re23–Re25,285Ir25 containing tricarbonyl diimine complex was found to be capable of binding and detecting F− ions with spectral changes in the absorption and emission (3LLCT transition from Mes2B groups to N⁁N ligand).368 By employing sp2-hybridized N ligand opposite to the chelating N atom in the cyclometalated ligand, Ir27 (λem = 755 nm) has a significantly lower LUMO level than Ir26 (λem = 694 nm), leading to a 60–80 nm red shift in emission of the former relative to the latter.369 Fig. 54  Chemical structures of some NIR phosphorescent Ir(III) complexes (Ir11–Ir27). 4.6.2 Ir(III) complexes with terdentate ligands. [Ir(N⁁N⁁N)2]3+ complexes with terdentate ligands, such as [Ir(tpy)2]3+ (λem = 458 nm, ΦP = 0.025, τ = 1.2 μs),188 generally have low ΦP, but their photophysical properties can be improved by replacing the N⁁N⁁N ligand with N⁁C⁁N variants. For instance, the ΦP of [Ir(dpyx)(ppy)(Cl)] [dpyx = 1,3-di(2-pyridyl)-4,6-dimethylbenzene] (λem = 508 nm, τ = 1.6 μs)371 and [Ir(Phbib)(ppy)(Cl)] [Phbib = bis-(N-phenylbenzimidazolyl)benzene] (λem = 562 nm, τ = 1.55 μs)372 can be enhanced up to 0.75, and 0.95, respectively. Furthermore, replacing N⁁N⁁N ligands with C⁁C⁁N or C⁁N⁁C ligands can lower the emission energy of Ir(III) complexes (Ir28–Ir34)373,374 into the NIR region, as shown in Fig. 55 and Table 6. Despite low luminescent intensity, Ir33 and Ir34 containing C⁁C⁁N ligands show red-shifted phosphorescence [3LLCT(C⁁C⁁N → bpy or phbpy)/MLCT] compared to the [Ir(N⁁N⁁N)(C⁁N⁁C)]+ complexes of Ir28–Ir32 [3LLCT(C⁁N⁁C → N⁁N⁁N)], due to the high π*-orbital energy of C⁁C⁁N ligands. Fig. 55  Chemical structures of some NIR phosphorescent Ir(III) complexes (Ir28–Ir39). 4.6.3 Ir(III) complexes with tetradentate ligands. Compared with Ir(III) complexes with terdentate ligand, luminescent Ir(III) complexes with tetradentate ligand are scarcer, even for Ir(III) porphyrin complexes. This is not surprising, in view of the fact that the Ir(III) porphyrin complexes exhibit distorted octahedral geometry, and that the synthesis and chemistry of such complexes are more difficult than those of the corresponding Pt(II) and Pd(II) metalloporphyrins, which are known to be strongly phosphorescent at RT. Recent work of Borisov et al., however, reveals that Ir(III) octaethylporphyrin (OEP) complex of [Ir(OEP)(CO)(Cl)] Ir35375 (Fig. 55) exhibits strong 3ILCT phosphorescence (λem = 672 nm) at RT with a ΦP and τ of 0.14 and 97 μs, respectively. By replacing the axial CO and Cl ligands with lipophilic ligands such as pyridine or N-(n-butyl)imidazole, the resulting Ir(III) complexes are more soluble and blue-shift emission (λem = 655 nm, ΦP = ∼0.20) and can be used as a water-soluble oxygen probe (by staining bovine serum albumin) and a trace oxygen sensor (by coupling to amino-modified silica gel). Ir36 bearing a π-extended benzoporphyrin ligand emits strong NIR phosphorescence (λem = ∼765 nm) with a ΦP up to 0.30. Unlike Ir(III) porphyrin complexes, Ir(III) corrole complexes (Ir37–Ir39)376 are found to have much weaker NIR phosphorescence (λem = ∼790 nm, ΦP = 0.012–3.3 × 10−4), which might be explained by the lower energy gap between the triplet excited state and the ground state for the metal-free corroles (λem = 790 nm). Moreover, the smaller cavity size of the corrols may result in non-planarity of the Ir(III) corrole complexes, which could promote nonradiative deactivation.4.6.4 Polynuclear Ir(III) complexes. In addition to Ir(III) centers, polynuclear complexes containing either Ru(II), Os(II), Re(II) or Cu(I) polyimine units linked by different bridging ligands display a rich variety of photoinduced energy transfer processes.70 As shown in Fig. 56, a dinuclear complex [(tpy)Ru(py4pyz)Ir(Cl)3]2+ (Ir40)377 [py4pyz = 2,3,5,6-tetrakis(2-pyridyl)pyrazine] incorporating Ru(II) and Ir(III) centers is linked via the bridging ligand of py4pyz. The lowest energy absorption in the electronic spectrum of the bimetallic complex, is an iridium-based 3MLCT transition, while, irrespective of the excited moiety, the emissive state (λem = 810 nm,) appears to be a ruthenium-based 3metal-to-bridging ligand charge-transfer (MBLCT) state. This is consistent with Ir → Ru energy transfer because [Ir(tpy)(Cl)3] and [Ru(tpy)2]2+ both emit from 3MLCT excited states with a λem at 632 nm (τ = 1.31 μs) and 670 nm (τ = 30 ns), respectively. On the contrary, [(bpy)2Ru(HAT)Ir(ppy)2]3+ (Ir41)378 (HAT = 1,4,5,8,9,12-hexaazatriphenylene) linked via the bridging HAT ligand exhibits Ir-based emission (λem = 760 nm, τ < 10 ns), consistent with Ru → Ir energy transfer ([Ir(ppy)2(HAT)]+: λem = 716 nm, τ < 10 ns; [Ru(bpy)2(HAT)]2+: λem = 676 nm, τ = 470 ns). Since the electrochemical data indicate that the closely lying Ir–C σ-bonding and Ir dπ orbitals are located above the Ru-centered dπ level, the emission of Ir41 is attributed to a strong admixture of Ir → HAT 3σ-bond to ligand charge transfer (SBLCT) and 3MLCT behavior. Further examples of tetranuclear heterometallic complexes (Ir42 and Ir43)379 reported by S. Serroni et al. demonstrate that the process of energy transfer in these polynuclear complexes is not only affected by the ligands but also by metal centers. For [M((23dpp)Ir(ppy)2)3]5+ [23dpp = 2,3-bis(2-pyridyl)-pyrazine] with M = Ru(II) or Os(II), the direction of the energy flow is reversed depending on the nature of the central metals. For [Ru((dpp)Ir(ppy)2)3]5+ (Ir42) (λem = 812 nm, ΦP = 1.5 × 10−4, τ = 2.2 ns), the central position is occupied by a [Ru(23dpp)3]2+ unit and the photon absorption of this chromophore results in efficient energy transfer to any one of the peripheral [Ir(dpp)(ppy)2]+ fragments, which emits. Conversely, for [Os((23dpp)Ir(ppy)2)3]5+ (Ir43) (λem = 825 nm, ΦP = 4.5 × 10−4, τ = 5.2 ns), the absorption by one of the Ir(III) chromophores is followed by a periphery-to-center excitation energy, and the emission is [Os(23dpp)3]2+-based. These results agree with the known ordering of the emissive triplet state energy levels: [Ru(23dpp)3]2+ > [Ir(dpp)(ppy)2]+ > [Os(23dpp)3]2+. Even though the study of photoinduced processes in Ir(III)-based arrays has attracted much attention, the resulting complexes usually exhibit low quantum yields (∼10−4),70,188 which limits their applications as NIR luminophores. Fig. 56  Chemical structures of some NIR phosphorescent Ir(III) complexes (Ir40–Ir43). Ir(III) ppy-type complexes, as the most efficient and versatile class of phosphorescent emitters for the applications in OLEDs and LECs, have attracted enormous attention. However, as NIR luminophores, they are no longer the “bright stars”, as listed in Table 6. Fortunately, Ir(III) porphyrin complex Ir36 emits unexpectedly strong NIR phosphorescence (λem = ∼765 nm) with a ΦP up to 0.30, indicating the bright future of Ir(III) complexes as NIR emitters.4.7 Pt(II) complexesAlthough fewer d8 Pt(II) complexes are known to be emissive in fluid solution at RT compared to the d6 metal ions complexes already discussed, Pt(II) complexes with the 4-coordinate square-planar geometry and strong Pt–Pt interactions have uniquely different photophysical properties from the other metal ions, such as Cr(III), Ru(II), Os(II), and Ir(III) with 6-coordinated octahedral geometry as well as Cu(I) with 4-coordinate tetrahedral geometry. The square-planar conformation is responsible for many of the key features that characterize the absorption, luminescence and other excited state properties of Pt(II) complexes. Over the past decades, several classes of phosphorescent Pt(II) complexes with high ΦP, color tunability, and thermal stability have been explored for high-performance OLEDs.65–694.7.1 Pt(II) complexes with bidentate ligands. [Pt(bpy)2]2+ and [Pt(bpy)(Cl)2] are not emissive at RT,98 as discussed in Section 2.1. Replacing bpy or Cl ligand with a ppy or acetylide ligand leads to a strong ligand field and results in strong phosphorescence emission in solution at RT. As examples, [Pt(ppy)(bpy)]+, [Pt(thpy)2],37,68 and [Pt(5,5Me2bpy)(CCPh)2]105 are highly luminescent at RT. A series of [Pt(bpy)(CCPh)2]-type complexes (Pt1–Pt7)380–384 (Fig. 57), reported by Chen et al., usually showed yellow–red emission in solution or in the solid state at RT, and these solid-state samples also could exhibit remarkable luminescence vapochrom and mechanochrom or thermo-triggered luminescence changes into the NIR region (Table 7 and Fig. 58). For instance, solid-state Pt6383 is selectively sensitive to vapors of oxygen-containing volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), dioxane, and tetrahydropyrane (THP), and it displays phosphorescence vapochrom change from 561 and 608 nm (3MLCT/LLCT) to 698 nm (toward THF vapor), 689 nm (toward dioxane vapor), and 715 nm (toward THP vapor) (3MMLCT/LLCT), respectively. Crystallographic analysis revealed that the short and long intermolecular Pt–Pt interactions in Pt6·THF crystals are 3.255 Å and 4.646 Å, respectively, while, for Pt6·CH2Cl2 crystals, those change into 4.262 and 4.482 Å, respectively, resulting in Pt6 exhibiting luminescence vapochrom toward THF vapor but not toward CH2Cl2 vapor. Therefore, the variation in the intermolecular Pt–Pt interactions is the key factor in inducing an intriguing luminescence switch. Upon mechanically grinding, desolvated Pt6 exhibits significant mechanoluminescence red shifts from 561 and 608 nm to 730 nm. Moreover, when Pt6 is heated, a thermo-triggered luminescence change occurs, leading to red shifting the bright yellow luminescence at 561 and 608 nm into red luminescence at 667 nm, as shown in Fig. 58. It is interesting, even though Pt3–Pt5382 have similar chemical structures, that they exhibit totally different luminescence vapochromic properties. Pt3 does not exhibit any vapoluminescence to common VOC vapors, but Pt4 and Pt5 have distinct vapoluminescence toward CHCl3 and CHCl3/CH2Cl2 vapors, respectively. In addition to intermolecular Pt–Pt interactions, –SiMe3 groups, π–π interactions, host–guest interactions, and hydrogen bonds also play important roles for vapoluminescence. It was demonstrated that the addition of –CO2Et group to the bpy ligand (Pt8),385 the introduction of π-extended systems to the acetylide ligand (Pt9–Pt13),66,386,387 or use of the strongly π-accepting bis(mesitylimino)acenaphthene ligands (Pt14–Pt18)388 (Fig. 57) are all efficient methods to lower the emission energy into the NIR region. It is noteworthy that Pt8–Pt10 complexes containing π-extended ligands exhibit dual fluorescence/phosphorescence emission, as mentioned in Section 2.3.2. Pt13,387 reported by Zhao et al., has an exceptionally long lived T1 excited state (54.7 μs, measured by transient absorption) and can be used as a triplet sensitizer for TTAU with an upconversion quantum yield of 22.4%, in stark contrast to the previously reported upconversion quantum yields for the transition-metal complexes of less than 20%.

Solid-state emission spectra of crystalline and corresponding ground materials based on complex Pt6 VOC at ambient temperature (adapted from ref. 383). Another type of NIR phosphorescent diimine-based Pt(II) complexes are the [Pt(diimine)(dithiolate)] complexes (Pt19–Pt28),112,389,390 that were explored by Eisenberg and shown in Fig. 59. In these heteroleptic complexes where 3LL′CT (L = dithiolate ligand, L′ = diimine ligand) excited states have been proposed, it is likely that the 3ML′CT excited states should be involved too. Even though most of them have low ΦP (10−3–10−5) at RT, these [Pt(diimine)(dithiolate)] complexes with strong absorption in the visible and NIR regions (Fig. 60) can be used as sensitizers for DSSCs.390 Fig. 59  Chemical structures of some NIR phosphorescent Pt(II) complexes (Pt19–Pt29).  Fig. 60  Normalized absorption (in CH2Cl2) and emission spectra (in frozen butyronitrile at 77 K) of some [Pt(diimine)(dithiolate)] complexes (adapted from ref. 112). In addition to diimine ligands, 1,2-enedithiolates (Pt30–Pt34),138,391,392 8-hydroxyquinoline/quinoline-8-thiol (Pt35–Pt46),370,393,394 dipyrrin (Pt47),395 or C⁁N ligands containing π-extended systems (Pt48–Pt53)140,141,396 are employed to prepare NIR phosphorescent Pt(II) complexes, as depicted in Fig. 61. Like Ir11–Ir16 and Ir22, Pt35–Pt46 containing dipyrrin and 8-hydroxyquinolin/quinoline-8-thiol ligands emit NIR phosphorescence from 3ILCT. As discussed in Section 2.3.2, Pt48–Pt53, like Pt8–Pt10, containing π-extended ligands show dual fluorescence/phosphorescence emission (Fig. 15 and Fig. 62), which might reduce T1 → S0 and result in low ΦP. Thus, it is obvious that the approach of simply extending the conjugation in order to obtain more red-shifted emission starts to break down. This is particularly significant for the design of technologically relevant NIR phosphorescent complexes, especially for Pt(II) and Os(II) complexes with low efficiency of SOC, because Ir(III) complexes containing similar ligands with Pt48 and Pt49 have strong SOC and show phosphorescence, but no fluorescence.140 However, dual fluorescent/phosphorescent molecular luminophores are scarce from a molecular photophysical perspective because a delicate balance between the S1 and T1 excited states must be kept. Non-efficient ISC will lead to fluorescence; as a result, no phosphorescence can be observed. Conversely, an efficient ISC will eliminate the fluorescence and only phosphorescence can be observed. Only those luminophores with moderate ISC effects can display the dual fluorescence and phosphorescence emission.141 These dual fluorescent/phosphorescent materials have some useful applications such as ratiometric optical oxygen sensing,38 as shown in Fig. 62. Pt30–Pt34 with 1,2-enedithiolates ligands also exhibit dual fluorescent/phosphorescent emission when protonated or deprotonated. Fig. 61  Chemical structures of some NIR phosphorescent Pt(II) complexes (Pt30–Pt53).

Unlike its rich luminescence properties exhibited in low-temperature glass media, the parent Pt(II) terpyridyl complex, [Pt(tpy)(Cl)]+, is found to be nonemissive in solution at RT due to the presence of lower-lying or thermally accessible 3d–d excited states, which provide facile deactivation pathways via molecular distortion. However, the emission of solid-state [Pt(tpy)(Cl)]+ at RT is broad, structure-less, and occurs at relatively long wavelengths with the characteristics indicative of charge-transfer emission from a polypyridine complex of platinum involved in neighbor–neighbor interactions. As shown in Fig. 63, two complex cations stack in the unit cell in a head-to-tail orientation with an intermolecular Pt–Pt separation of 3.329 Å.397 Strong d(z2)–d(z2) interactions result in emission from 3dσ*π* states, often designated as 3MMLCT states.398–400 Through aryl-modified/fused terpyridine ligands or the replacement of the chloro auxiliary ligand with stronger-field ligands, such as alkynyl or –CN group, the photophysical properties of Pt(II) tpy-typed complexes can be dramatically improved.398 For instance, [Pt(4CN-tpy)(CN)]+ (4Me2N-tpy = 4′-dimethylamino-2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine) exhibits a low-energy charge-transfer excitation at λem = 520 nm with ΦP = 0.26 and τ = 22 μs in CH2Cl2 at RT.401 Fig. 63  A perspective drawing of the [Pt(tpy)(Cl)]+ cation (adapted from ref. 397). As shown in Fig. 64, Yam et al. whose work focuses on luminescent alkynyl complexes,261,283,284 firstly reported a series of luminescent Pt(II) terpyridyl acetylide complexes, [Pt(tpy)(CCR)]+ (Pt54–Pt62),402–408 with enhanced solubility and intense emission in solution due to the presence of the alkynyl group. In general, Pt54–Pt57402 in dilute MeCN at RT show orange–red phosphorescence (3MLCT) (λem = 560–665 nm, ΦP = 1.1 × 103–0.012, τ ≤ 500 ns), originating from the [dπ(Pt) → π*(tpy)] 3MLCT excited state with some mixing of a [π(CCR) → π*(tpy)] 3LLCT character. However, upon going from MeCN solutions to the solid state, the lower-energy emission bands (3MMLCT) are observed at 710–800 nm at RT (Table 7). Further work demonstrates that recrystallization of [Pt59]OTf,403 under different conditions afforded two crystal forms, a dark green form and a red form. As shown in Fig. 65, the complex cations are equally separated with short intermolecular Pt–Pt contacts of 3.388 Å in the dark green crystal form, while in the red crystal form, a zigzag arrangement of pairs of complex cations showing a dimeric structure with alternating short and long Pt–Pt distances of 3.394 and 3.648 Å, respectively, is observed. The difference in the crystal colors has been attributed to the variations of the intermolecular arrangement as well as the different extent of Pt–Pt and π–π stacking interactions due to aggregation.400 Dissolution of either of the two crystal forms gives a yellow solution in MeCN, but upon adding the insoluble solvent of diethyl ether (EA) to MeCN, the solution of aggregated Pt59 exhibits “solvatochromism” at 615 nm and “solvatoluminescence” at 785 nm (Fig. 65).403 The photophysical properties in these solvent-induced self-assembly aggregates of [Pt59]X (X = OTf−, PF6−, ClO4−, BF4−) also were found to be dependent on the nature of the anions (Fig. 65), while no observable color or spectral changes were found for the larger non-coordinating BPh4− anion.404 In light of the fact that the counter-anions play an important role in governing the assembly of the positively charged [Pt(tpy)(CCR)]+ complex cations, a polyelectrolyte, namely poly(acrylic acid), upon deprotonation can indeed induce self-assembly of Pt59, and, in turn, induce remarkable UV/Visible and NIR emission intensity changes,405,407 as shown in Fig. 66. Moreover, single-stranded nucleic acids, which carry multiple negative charges in an aqueous medium at near neutral pH, also induce the aggregation and self-assembly of Pt59 and Pt60via electrostatic binding of the platinum complexes to the single-stranded nucleic acids.406 Therefore, it is anticipated that such drastic solvent-induced sensitive changes in color and on–off switching of emission via aggregation of metal–metal-bonded and π-stacked species will serve as versatile reporters and probes of environmental changes and may find potential applications in materials science and sensor technology. Subsequently, a “proof-of-principle” study illustrates that the self-assembly NIR emissive lysozyme aptamer (LA)- or thrombin-binding aptamer (TBA)–Pt61 mixture408 are sensitive towards the conformational and microenvironmental changes of aptamers and can be used as label- and immobilization-free turn-off probes for lysozyme and thrombin detection with good selectivity and specificity, since that lysozyme and thrombin have higher binding affinity with aptamers than Pt61 (Fig. 67). Without any aggregation effect, Pt64–Pt68,409–412 which contain π-extended systems in the N⁁N⁁N ligands, emit NIR emission in dilute solution at RT.

One of the potential advantages of Pt(II) complexes containing a terdentate ligand over a bidentate ligand relates to the inhibition of the D2d distortion that bis-bidentate complexes can undergo, through twisting of the two planes relative to one another. Thus, if the cyclometallating ring could be incorporated into a terdentate ligand rather than a bidentate ligand (e.g., C⁁N⁁N rather than C⁁N), then further increases in the luminescence efficiency of Pt(II) complexes [e.g., [Pt(phbpy)(Cl)] (λem = 565 nm, ΦP = 0.025, τ = 510 ns in dilute CH2Cl2)]104 might be anticipated.69 Che and co-workers have pioneered413 and done much work on luminescent C⁁N⁁N-based Pt(II) complexes (ΦP up to 0.68 in CH2Cl2)414 and their applications (Fig. 11, 16, and 19).43,104,129,152,154,413–415 For instance, Pt69–Pt71152,413 (Fig. 68) are highly orange (3MLCT) emitters (λem = 550–566 nm, ΦP = 0.21–0.057, τ = 0.63–14 μs) in dilute CH2Cl2 at RT. In the aggregated state, they have short Pt–Pt contacts, e.g., 3.37 Å for Pt69, resulting in red-shifted NIR emission (3MMLCT) (Table 7), like Pt54–Pt62. With the covalent attachment of biocompatible poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), polymer Pt72415 yields dual emission from the monomer (λem = 543 nm, 3MLCT) and aggregation (λem = 710 nm, 3MMLCT) of the [Pt(C⁁N⁁N)(Cl)] moieties in water. Since PEG polymer behaves like a typical non-ionic surfactant in water, micellar assemblies can form with the hydrophobic [Pt(C⁁N⁁N)(Cl)] moieties embedded inside, leading to aggregation of the [Pt(C⁁N⁁N)(Cl)] moieties. The emission of Pt72 is enhanced in hydrophobic regions of protein molecules in aqueous solution, thus Pt72 can function as a luminescent probe for protein denaturation due to the urea unfolding reaction, as demonstrated in Fig. 69. Intermolecular hydrogen bonds in Pt73416 also are found to be facile inducers of strong Pt–Pt interactions (3.3–3.4 Å) in the solid state, resulting in the NIR emission from Pt73 excimers, as shown Fig. 70.

Fig. 70  A hydrogen-bonded Pt73 excimer through intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the uracil moieties (adapted from ref. 416). An alternative route to obtain highly luminescent Pt(II) complexes is cyclometalation with N⁁C⁁N-coordinating dpyb ligands, as reported by Williams et al.67–69 Structurally, dpyb ligands lead to shorter Pt–C bonds (1.90 Å) than in the previous isomeric C⁁N⁁N systems (2.04 Å), thus the parent complex [Pt(dpyb)(Cl)] (Pt74)417 (Fig. 71) in dilute CH2Cl2 at RT exhibits strong phosphorescence (λem = 491 nm, ΦP = 0.60, τ = 7.2 μs) with a highly structured profile and a very small Stokes shift, implying a predominant 3π–π* assignment for the emissive state. Like C⁁N⁁N-based Pt(II) complexes Pt69–Pt73, N⁁C⁁N-based Pt(II) complexes Pt74–Pt76167,418 in aggregated states have a new strong NIR emission (ΦP = 0.24–0.35 for vacuum-evaporated neat films) at about 700 nm from the excimers, which can be used as NIR emitters in OLEDs to achieve unusually high EQEs up to 14.5%, as shown in Fig. 72. If doping Pt75 into a host, white OLEDs can be achieved by the simultaneous emission of monomer in blue and excimer in red from a single emitter of Pt75.419 The further work on Pt77–Pt80420 by the same group revealed that the introduction of trifluoromethyl groups onto the N⁁C⁁N ligand leads to a red shift in the excimer emission band (e.g., λem = 756 nm for Pt78), but the introduction of F atoms showed inverse effects (e.g., λem = 677 nm for Pt77), as shown in Fig. 73. In addition to the chemical structures of N⁁C⁁N ligands, the auxiliary ligand X in [Pt(N⁁C⁁N)X] complexes has strong effects on Pt–Pt interactions in aggregated states. Pt81 and Pt82421 with the same N⁁C⁁N ligand and different auxiliary ligand X (X = Cl and NCS for Pt81 and Pt82, respectively) displayed similar luminescence in solution but intensively different luminescence in the solid state, due to their different molecular packing. Pt82 (X = NCS) has much shorter Pt–Pt interactions (3.3 Å) than Pt81 (X = Cl, Pt–Pt interactions = 4.4 Å), leading to a red-shifted EL band up to 855 nm for Pt82 (λEL = 685 nm for Pt81). Like Pt1–Pt7, [Pt(N⁁C⁁N)(Cl)]-typed complex of Pt83422 exhibits the luminescent mechanochromism in the solid state, accounted for by excimer emission. Furthermore, Che,423,424 Yam,425 and colleagues have investigated the photophysics of [Pt(C⁁N⁁C)L] complexes containing the cyclometalated ligand 2,6-diphenylpyridine, denoted as dppy or C⁁N⁁C (Fig. 23). Unfortunately, these complexes containing L ligand of 4-t-butylpyridine, 2,6-diphenylisocyanide, or triphenylphosphine generally display weak-to-no emission in dilute solution and strong red emission in solid state at RT.

(b) EL spectra recorded at the applied voltage of 10 V (adapted from ref. 167 and 418).  Fig. 73  Emission spectra of the Pt74 and Pt77–Pt80 in CH2Cl2 with high concentration of 1.5 × 10−4 M at 298 K. The weak excimer bands of Pt78–Pt80 have been expanded for clarity (adapted from ref. 420). 4.7.3 Pt(II) complexes with tetradentate ligands. As discussed in Section 3.3, d8 Pt(II) complexes with the 4-coordinate square-planar geometry have inherent advantages in being chelated by tetradentate ligands and result in highly stable and emissive complexes. [Pt(qtpy)]2+ complexes Pt84 and Pt85426 (Fig. 74), reported by Che et al. have similar chemical structures, in which only Pt84 with the steric rigidity from four methyl groups displays strong RT green emission (λem = 496 nm, ΦP = 0.026, τ = 7.0 μs) in dilute MeCN, originated from 3π–π* or 3MLCT. However, in the solid state, both of these complexes show weak NIR emission at about 700 nm. The shortest Pt–Pt distances of 7.249 and 5.904 Å for Pt84 and Pt85, respectively, are too long for any Pt–Pt interaction, suggesting the possibility of having ligand π–π interactions in the solid state. Thus, it seems that significant Pt–Pt interactions in the solid state of Pt(II) polypyridine complexes occur only when either the metal atom is bonded to three or less pyridyl units with the remaining coordination sites occupied by small molecules or when the four coordinating aryl rings bow to one side for strain release. Some other tetradentate ligands, especially N⁁O⁁O⁁N ligands,126,207–209,427 have been used to obtain highly emissive (ΦP up to 0.6) Pt(II) complexes. Among these complexes, Pt86166 and Pt87208 exhibit NIR emission in dilute solution. Fig. 74  Chemical structures of some NIR phosphorescent Pt(II) complexes (Pt84–Pt98). To date, the best successful and known NIR phosphorescent transition-metal complexes are Pt(II) porphyrin complexes due to their highly thermal and chemical stability, good solubility, rich chemical modification and high luminescence. For example, [Pt(OEP)] (Pt88) (Fig. 74) emits strong deep-red phosphorescence (λem = 646 nm, ΦP = 0.5, τ = 100 μs)38 from 3ILCT in solution and has wide applications in OLEDs77 and oxygen sensing.38 The molecules of Pt88 are found to aggregate on the (001) surface of KBr, resulting in NIR emission (λem = 775 nm).428 One possible way to tune phosphorescence of Pt(II) porphyrin complexes is to modify the tetrapyrrole macrocycle of porphyrin ligands. The heart of the porphyrin structure is an 18 π-electron aromatic system, which determines basic optical properties and electronic spectra of the resulting complexes. Hydrogenation of one or more of the exo-pyrrole double bonds in the macrocycle (like that occurring in related structures of chlorins, bacteriochlorins, and dihydrochlorins) results in substantial red shifting of both absorbance and emission spectra. Pt(II) complexes of chlorins, bacteriochlorins, et al. are also known to show phosphorescence, but they are less stable than corresponding porphyrin complexes. Furthermore, it is even difficult to synthesize Pt(II) complexes of the “reduced porphyrins”, since metalation at elevated temperatures is accompanied by the decomposition of such compounds.429 Papkovsky et al. reported a series of Pt(II) porphyrin ketones (or oxochlorins) complexes (Pt89–Pt92)429,430 with improved photochemical and chemical stability and strong NIR phosphorescence (λem = 758–767 nm, ΦP = 0.1–0.12, τ = 24–60 μs) in micellar sulfite solution (MSS) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for the application of oxygen sensing and live-cell fluorescence imaging, as shown in Fig. 75. Some other types of tetrapyrrole macrocycle are also used to prepare NIR phosphorescent Pt(II) complexes (Pt93–Pt96).431–433 One successful application is the use of dual luminophor paint containing pressure-sensitive Pt93 and temperature-sensitive [Mg(TFPP)] [TFPP = meso-tetra(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin], in which the latter provides temperature-sensitive paint as the pressure-independent reference (Fig. 76). The emission intensity ratio of Pt93/[Mg(TFPP)] produced ideal pressure measurements in a wind tunnel with a very low-temperature dependence of –0.1% °C−1.434 As discussed in Section 3.3, as another important class of tetrapyrrole macrocycle, Pc and its complexes with strong π–π stacks are less soluble and emissive than porphyrin. Usually, Pt(II) phthalocyanine complexes (Pt97 and Pt98)237,241,435 display dual fluorescence emission (λem = ∼700 nm) and NIR phosphorescence emission (λem = ∼1000 nm) with low Φ. Fig. 75  Confocal fluorescence image of A549 cells loaded with Pt92 and contained with (a) or without (b) 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (adapted from ref. 430).  Fig. 76  (a) Emission spectra of the dual sensor film at several percentages oxygen concentrations. (b) Pressure measurements (Pt93/[Mg(TFPP)]) in wind tunnel for binary formulation at V =94 m s−1 and three yaw angles: −20°, 0° and 20° (adapted from ref. 434). An alternative way to achieve red-shifted phosphorescence is to extend π-conjugated system of porphyrin core at meso-positions (5, 10, 15, and 20-position) or β-pyrrole positions (2, 3, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, and 18-position). However, the former has been demonstrated to not be an efficient way to extend the π-conjugated system. For instance, as shown in Fig. 8, [Pt(TPP)] containing four phenyl groups at meso-positions of porphyrin has a similar emission spectrum with [Pt(OEP)] (Pt88) because these phenyl groups in [Pt(TPP)] are almost vertical to the porphyrin core and have little contribution to extending the π-conjugated system. Recent work,436–438 done by Vinogradov and Thompson, respectively, revealed that porphyrin chromophores with fused aromatic moieties at the β-pyrrole positions, for example, tetrabenzoporphyrin (TBP) or tetranaphthaloporphyrins (TNP), exhibit a bathochromic shift of the absorption and emission energy, owing to the expansion of the π-conjugated system of the porphyrin core. Since then, Pt(II) π-extended porphyrin complexes (Pt99–Pt124)433,436–446 (Fig. 77) have received great attention. Pt113437 with the meso-unsubstituted TBP ligand displays strong NIR phosphorescence (λem = 745 nm, ΦP = 0.51, τ = 50 μs) in DMF at RT. The presence of four phenyl groups at meso-positions of TBP in Pt99438 leads to more soluble non-planar porphyrins and further red-shifted absorption and emission spectra (λem = 765 nm, ΦP = 0.7, τ = 53 μs). The fluorinated derivatives (Pt100–Pt102)439,440 of Pt99 show not only improved solubility and photo-stability but also lower energy in emission bands (λem = 773–788 nm, ΦP = 0.27–0.60, τ = 38–50 μs). The electron-withdrawing CO2R groups in Pt104 and Pt105443 further lower their emission bands to 791 nm. Dendritic Pt105 containing the covalent attachment of biocompatible PEG might be used as phosphorescent probes for oxygen imaging in biological systems. [B(dipyrrin)(F)2]–[Pt(TBP)] hybrid complex Pt109444 exhibits broad visible-light absorption, fast and efficient intramolecular energy transfer from the [B(dipyrrin)(F)2] to [Pt(TBP)] unit, and strong NIR phosphorescence (λem = 772 nm, ΦP = 0.26) with an unusually long-lived τ of 69 μs. A study of an extensive set of variously meso-substituted [Pt(TBP)] reveals that the emission spectra of 5,15-diaryl-substituted complexes (Pt110–Pt112)441 generally exhibit blue shifts with longer τ and enhanced ΦP values compared to those of 5,10,15,20-tetraryl-substitued complexes, because the tetraphenyl-substitued complexes are more distorted from planarity, which increases the nonradiative decay rate, shortening τ and ΦP. It is an exception for Pt114441 which exhibits a distinct red-shifted phosphorescence band at 786 nm. At the same time, this study has proved that the best efficient way to lower emission band is further extending π-conjugated system at β-pyrrole positions. As shown in Fig. 78, the Pt(II) tetrabenzo- (Pt99), tetranaphtho- (Pt115), and tetraanthroporphyrin (Pt119)441 complexes exhibit phosphorescence at λem ranging from 770 to 1020 nm. However, it should be noted that the radiative decay rates from the triplet states are relatively constant across the series; on the other hand, the non-radiative decay rate increases substantially with the decreasing T1 → S0 energy gap. An energy gap law correlation was observed, which indicates there is a limited prospect for extending the emission wavelength to longer wavelengths because the ΦP will become very low. Pt120–Pt124445,446 with less symmetry were also explored. Pt120 (λem = 841 nm) and Pt121445 (λem = 844 nm) containing 5,10-biaryl- and 5,10,15-teraryl-TBP, respectively, displayed distinct red-shifted phosphorescence compared to the 5,15-biaryl- (Pt110) (λem = 770 nm) or 5,10,15,20-tetraryl-TBP-based (Pt99) (λem = 765 nm) Pt(II) complex. On the contrary, Pt122–Pt124446 (λem = 815–870 nm) with less π-extended system at β-pyrrole positions give blue-shift shifted phosphorescence compared to Pt115 (λem = 891 nm). These Pt(II) π-extended porphyrin complexes with strong absorption in visible/NIR region, intense NIR phosphorescence, and high stability, have a variety of applications, such as NIR OLEDs,438,442,447,448 PVCs,449,450 TTAUs,451 oxygen sensors,433,440,443,445,446 and biomedical applications.443,452 For example, Pt103-442 and Pt115-based448 OLEDs exhibit intense NIR EL with EQE of 9.2% (λem = 773 nm) and 3.8% (λem = 896 nm), respectively. Pt115, encapsulated into phospholipid nanomicelles, can be used as efficient NIR optical probes for tumor imaging and detection (Fig. 79).452 Fig. 77  Chemical structures of some NIR phosphorescent Pt(II) complexes (Pt99–Pt124).

Unlike polynuclear Ru(II) or Ir(III) complexes, some polynuclear Pt(II) complexes (Pt125–Pt142)154,155,160,161,432,454–458 (Fig. 80) are highly emissive in the NIR region and have received great attention. As discussed previously, for mononuclear Pt(II) complexes, intermolecular Pt–Pt interactions play an important role in red shifting emission spectrum, while, for polynuclear Pt(II) complexes, e.g.Pt125, Pt126, and Pt129–Pt135, intramolecular Pt–Pt interactions are the keys for NIR emission. In a series of pyrazolate-bridged cyclometalated Pt(II) complexes, such as Pt125,155 the bridging pyrazolate controls the degree of intramolecular Pt–Pt interactions and, thus, the nature of the excited state. The two bulky tert-butyl groups in Pt125 force the two C⁁N Pt moieties closer together, resulting in the shortest Pt–Pt distance (2.8343 Å) and, thus, the most red-shifted emission band (λem = ∼690 nm) in dilute solution at RT, as shown in Fig. 81. Pt126453 displays strong NIR phosphorescence (λem = 721 nm, ΦP = 0.18) from 3MMLCT in solution and is suitable for the application in OLEDs (EQE = 6.3%). The dinuclear alkynylPt(II) terpyridyl complexes of Pt129 and Pt130,160 like the mononuclear alkynylPt(II) terpyridyl complex of Pt59, are found to show inter- and/or intramolecular aggregation in fluid solution state at low temperature or even at RT and, thus, drastic colour changes and NIR emission (3MMLCT) enhancement, which may find useful applications as molecular temperature probes with tunable operation range. However, Pt131160 is an exception and has the negative result from its variable-temperature emission study, suggesting that the incorporation of bulky tert-butyl moieties in the terpyridyl ligand inhibits the self-assembly behaviour of Pt131 and hence the emission originates from an excited state of 3MLCT character which has a higher energy than its analogue Pt130. Pt132,161 the first example of phosphorescent tweezers, shows host–guest interactions with cationic, neutral and anionic square-planar Pt(II), as well as heterometallic Pd(II), Au(I), and Au(III) guests, as supported by spectroscopic measurements in CH2Cl2 solution. The binding affinity between the host and the guest is strongly perturbed by the Pt–M, π–π and electrostatic interactions, giving rise to various spectroscopic changes depending on the nature of the guest molecules. Among a series of dinuclear Pt(II), Au(III), and mixed Pt–Au complexes built on a xanthene scaffold, only dinuclear Pt(II) complex Pt135456 with strong intramolecular Pt–Pt interactions emits NIR emission (λem = 817 nm) in dilute solution at RT. In addition to dinuclear Pt(II) complexes, some ternuclear Pt(II) complexes, such as Pt133 and Pt134,154 are found to display NIR emission in dilute solution at RT. For the red crystal of Pt133, the intramolecular metal–metal contacts of 3.194 Å at Pt1–Pt2 and 3.399 Å at Pt2–Pt3, with the Pt1–Pt2–Pt3 angle being 169°, indicate d8–d8 interactions across Pt1–Pt2–Pt3, resulting in red-shifted emission (λem = 710 nm in MeCN at RT) compared to the analogous dinuclear Pt(II) complex of [(Pt(phbpy))2(μ-dppm)]2+ (Fig. 19) (λem = 652 nm in MeCN at RT) with intramolecular Pt–Pt contacts of 3.270 Å.152 For other dinuclear Pt(II) complexes (Pt127,454Pt128,455 and Pt136–Pt140432,457) in Fig. 80, the two Pt(II) metal centers were found to be separated and, thus, the absence of intramolecular Pt–Pt interactions. For example, the Pt–Pt distances of Pt127 and Pt128 are 4.501 Å and 8.538 Å, respectively, beyond the range of intermetal distances (<3.50 Å) normally observed in monomeric Pt(II) extended linear-chain structures. Thus, their NIR emission is ascribed to 3LLCT (thiolate → diimine) and 3MLCT [dπ(Pt) → π*(tpy)]/3LLCT [π(CC) → π*(tpy)], respectively. Pt128 containing calix[4]crown-5 was been demonstrated to show luminescence enhancement, upon metal ion-binding, with a more selective binding toward K+ over the other alkali-metal and alkaline earth-metal ions (Fig. 82). Since attaching Pt(II) coordination centers directly onto the [B(dipyrrin)(F)2] core in Pt136457 using acetylide bonds, rather than on the periphery of the [B(dipyrrin)(F)2] core maximizes the heavy-atom effect of Pt(II) ion, the ISC is facilitated and the radiative decay of the T1 excited state of [B(dipyrrin)(F)2] is observed, resulting in dual 3MLCT emission at 660 nm and the 3ILCT emission at 770 nm with unusually long τ of 128.4 μs at RT. Some heteronuclear Pt(II) complexes (Pt141 and Pt142)458 were also reported. They usually have low ΦP, which limits their applications as NIR luminophores.

Fig. 81  Normalized emission spectra of Pt(II) complexes [bridging pyrazolate = pyrazolate (1), 3,5-dimethylpyrazolate (2), 3-methyl-5-tert-butylpyrazolate (3), and 3,5-bis(tert-butyl)pyrazolate (4 or Pt125); [Pt(46dFppy)(pyrazolate)B(Et)2 (5)] in MeTHF(adapted from ref. 155).  Fig. 82  Absorption and emission spectral changes of Pt128 upon addition of various concentrations of KPF6 and photograph showing the effect of various metal ions (5.0 × 10−5 M) on the emission intensities of Pt128 (3.7 × 10−5 M) in MeCN (adapted from ref. 455). Table 7 summarizes the photophysical properties of some NIR phosphorescent Pt(II) complexes at RT. Among the NIR transition-metal complexes, Pt(II) complexes, especially Pt(II) porphyrin complexes, exhibit the best photophysical properties including long τ, high ΦP, tunable emission bands, and wide applications. Pt(II) complexes with the 4-coordinate square-planar geometry have inherent advantages in being chelated by π-extended tetradentate ligands to achieve highly strong NIR phosphorescence, therefore, new tetradentate ligands rather than porphyrins are expectant. Furthermore, recent studies reveal that Pt(III)459 and Pt(IV)460,461 complexes are luminescent as well, which might be a new direction for the design of luminescent Pt complexes.4.8 Pd(II) complexesThe heavy atom effect exerted by the d8 Pd(II) metal centre is much weaker than that of Pt(II), and consequently phosphorescent Pd(II) complexes are rare when compared with the analogous Pt(II) complexes.37 Most Pd(II) complexes display weak triplet emission only at low temperature, with RT emission generally restricted to fluorescence. It also has been recognized that when incorporated into polynuclear complexes, Pd(II) centers may lead to partial quenching of luminescence.462,463 Despite these unfavorable premises, luminescent cyclometalated Pd(II) complexes have been designed for applications in OLEDs463–465 and oxygen sensing.429,433,436,439,440,443,445,446,466,467 In particular, Pd(II) porphyrin complexes (Pd1–Pd30)429,433,436,437,440,443,445,446,465–467 (Fig. 83) display intense NIR phosphorescence, but with significantly low ΦP and long τ, and red-shifted emission bands compared with the analogous Pt(II) complexes, as listed in Table 8. For instance, Pd10440 is a dual emitter with strong NIR phosphorescence and weak red fluorescence at RT.468 The λem, ΦP, and τ of Pd10 is 800 nm, 0.21, and 286 μs,440 respectively, while that of its analogous Pt99 is 765 nm, 0.7, and 53 μs,438 respectively. However, it is noteworthy that the metalation of Pd(II) ions into porphyrin ligands is usually easier than that of Pt(II) ions.

The photophysics of luminescent mono-, di- and polynuclear d10 Au(I) complexes has been extensively studied.39,72–74 The most common coordination geometry observed for Au(I) is two-coordinated (linear) or three-coordinated (trigonal planar) resulting in the uniqueness of the weak intermolecular attractive interaction present in between gold centers. Many mononuclear Au(I) complexes containing carbene, phosphine, thiolate and acetylide ligands exhibit RT phosphorescence, originating from 3LMCT or 3ILCT, with relatively lower ΦP compared to Ir(III) and Pt(II) complexes.37 Although it is rare to find mononuclear Au(I) complexes (Au1–Au4)469,470 (Fig. 84) displaying NIR emission (Table 9), for di- and polynuclear Au(I) complexes, the weak intermolecular Au–Au interactions can improve their photophysics and lower the energy of emission bands. For example, [Au2(dppm)2]2+ with a measured Au–Au distance of 2.962 Å exhibits strong orange emission (λem = 570 nm, ΦP = 0.21, τ = 21 μs) at RT.471 The dinuclear Au(I) complexes (Au5–Au7)472 emit NIR emission in solution at RT, however, it probably does not originate from the intermolecular Au–Au interactions but σ(Au–P) → π*(naphthyl) because of the similarity in the emission energies of the 1,8-bis(diphenylphosphino)naphthalene-containing Au7 complex to that of the analogous mononuclear Au4470 complex. It also was revealed that, in the presence of low-lying phosphinonaphthalene ligand π* orbitals, the Au–Au interactions no longer play a significant role in governing the lowest excited-state properties of these complexes. As the luminescence properties of dinuclear Au(I) complexes (Au8 and Au9)473 show a strong dependence on the Au–Au interactions, this unique behaviour can be exploited in the development of sensing materials for K+, as shown in Fig. 85. The emission spectrum of Au8 shows a drop in intensity at ca. 502 nm, with the concomitant formation of a long-lived emission band at ca. 720 nm (τ = 200 ns) upon addition of potassium ion. The cavity size of the benzo-15-crown-5 ring is too small to fit a K+ ion and thus the two Au(I) centers are pushed closely to each other, resulting in some weak Au–Au interactions and subsequently emission change. The low-energy emission band has been proposed to arise from a 3LMMCT (thiolate ligand → Au–Au bond) excited state. There has been an immense research interest devoted to the d10 Cu(I) clusters, such as [Cu4(X)4(L)4] in Section 4.2.2, due to their rich intrinsic photophysical properties. However, photophysical studies related to the d10 Au(I) chalcogenide clusters are relatively rare, possibly due to the relative instability of Au(I) chalcogenides compared to that of gold metal.73 Yam and coworkers have used ancillary diphosphine ligands acting as a “protective coating” to obtain a series of luminescent hexanuclear (Au10),474 decanuclear, and dodecanuclear Au(I) sulfido complexes,73 in which Au10 with the Au–Au distances range from 2.939 to 3.378 Å displays NIR phosphorescence (S → Au–Au 3LMMCT) (λem = 810 nm, τ = 3.6 μs) in solution and red phosphorescence (λem = 630 nm) in solid at RT due to the rigidochromic effects, like [Cu4(X)4(L)4]. The emission band of Au10Se4-cored Au11475 with Au–Au distances of 2.98–3.35 Å is further red shifted at 880 nm in solution and 970 nm in solid at RT (1020 nm in solid at 77 K). It should be noted that, in terms of size, the large polynuclear Au(I) selenide complexes are comparable to small metallic Au clusters or nanoparticles, which are found to show weak NIR emission in the range of 1100–1600 nm.475 An unprecedented Au18-membered thiacrown ether[18]aneS6 thiacrown (Au12)476 directed by Au(I)–Au(I) interactions (3.0145–3.3295 Å) and supported by tridentate phosphine and μ3-sulfido ligands was reported by Yam et al. The sulfides in the central cavity point toward each other and are located on the same plane, allowing them to bind the soft Ag+ ion with immediate and pronounced spectroscopic changes. Reversible binding and spectroscopic changes can be readily achieved upon addition of MeCN without disruption of the Au18 macrocycle (Fig. 86).

Compared with their isoelectronic Pt(II) complexes, cyclometalated d8 Au(III) complexes that are highly emissive in fluid solutions are still sparse. The high electrophilicity of Au(III) ion renders the unoccupied dσ*(dx2–y2) orbital low-lying and thus the low-energy LMCT excited states close to the emissive intraligand excited states, resulting in effective emission quenching. A representative example is [Au(bpy)(Cl)2]+ which emits in the solid state, but not in solution. To increase the luminescence efficiency of Au(III) complexes, strong-field ligands are desired to push the dσ* orbital to higher-lying energy.73,75 The incorporation of a strong σ-donating auxiliary ligand L, such as mesityl, acetylide or NHC ligands, is found to be one successful way to obtain high ΦP up to 11.4% in solution at RT.477 High-performance yellow OLEDs (EQE = 11.5%) based on [Au(C⁁N⁁C)(CCAr)] complexes are also known.478 Many square-planar d8 complexes are unstable with respect to molecular distortions that lead to a symmetry decrease from D4h to D2d, and this is known to facilitate non-radiative excited state decay, as discussed in Section 4.7.2. A common strategy to avoid this problem is the use of terdentate477,478 or tetradentate chelating ligands rather than bidentate chelating ligands. Unfortunately, contrary to other metalloporphyrins, ordinary Au(III) porphyrin complexes are essentially non-luminescent in solution at RT.75 A recent study reveals that Au(III) N-confused tetraphenylporphyrin complex (Au11)479 (Fig. 84) is emissive in solution at RT. The electron donation from the confused pyrrole to the Au(III) atom through the Csp2–Au(III) bond might contribute to the relatively electron rich Au(III) center, which results in a raising of the energy of the d–d transitions high enough to inhibit emission quenching.The photophysics of luminescent Au(I) complexes has been extensively studied, while, for Au(III) complexes, research until now has focused almost exclusively on C⁁N⁁C and C⁁N⁁N ligands, and there has been essentially no experimental work on other terdentate or tetradentate ligands. Therefore, for either visible or NIR phosphorescence, the photophysics of cyclometalated Au(III) complexes is virtually unexplored.5. Prospects and conclusionsRecent advances in research on NIR phosphorescent materials and applications were described with emphasis on the emerging class of NIR phosphorescent transition-metal complexes and a number of technologically important applications. With respect to material design, various types of transition-metal complexes reported in the literature, such as Cu(I), Au(II), Cr(III), Re(I), Re(III), Ru(II), Os(II), Ir(III), Pt(II), Pd(II), Au(I), and Au(III) complexes, were systemically reviewed, discussed, and compared. Among these complexes, Pt(II) complexes with the 4-coordinate square-planar geometry and strong Pt–Pt interactions have uniquely different and useful photophysical properties in comparison to the other metal ions for the purposes of NIR emission. In general, there are three efficient ways to achieve NIR phosphorescence. The first one is to extend the π-conjugated system in the ligands. The representative and successful examples are Pt(II) π-extended porphyrin complexes, which display many advantages including high thermal and chemical stability, good solubility, multiple options for chemical modification, and high luminescence for a wide variety of applications including NIR OLEDs, PVCs, sensors, TTAUs, and biomedical imaging. The second strategy is to protect Cu(I), Re(III), and Au(I) cluster complexes with ancillary chalcogenide or phosphine ligands. The last tactic involves using intermolecular and/or intramolecular metal–metal interactions to lower emission energy, as discussed in Section 4.7.In respect of the development of NIR phosphorescent transition-metal complexes, the following aspects should be considered. (1) Macromolecules containing NIR phosphorescent transition-metal complexes, especially, dendrimers with the different properties of core and antenna, are expected, due to their many advantages including protection of the long-lived phosphorescent core by functional or biocompatible antenna, good solubility in solvent, convenient fabrication into thin films or nanoparticles, and wide applications. (2) Supermolecules building on self-assembly of transition-metal complexes through intermolecular and/or intramolecular metal–metal interactions, π–π interactions, and/or hydrogen bands might be another hot spot for NIR phosphorescent materials. (3) New chelating ligands, especially porphyrin ligands, with extended π-systems and stronger rigidity are in demand. Previous efforts mainly focused on fusing aromatic units at β-positions of porphyrin, while a recent review480 revealed that porphyrins fused with other aromatic units at both the meso- and β-positions through intramolecular oxidative coupling show very strong bathochromic shifts of absorption (λabs reaching 1.5–2 μm in some cases). This would be helpful for the design of NIR phosphorescent porphyrin complexes. (4) Polynuclear (n > 20) Cu(I), Re(III), and Au(I) cluster complexes protected by ancillary chalcogenide or phosphine ligands are needed because they might have some unique different photophysical properties from small molecules and nano materials. For instance, crown-like Au(I) cluster complexes containing up to 36 Au(I) atoms have been reported.481 In terms of size, these polynuclear Au(I) cluster complexes are comparable to small metallic Au clusters or nanoparticles, which also are found to show weak NIR emission. This might help in the design of luminescent Au nanoparticles with a precise number of metal atoms by using polynuclear Au(I) cluster complexes as the precursors. (5) It has been demonstrated that incorporating DA systems into ligands is an efficient tool for obtaining NIR emission for fluorescent materials,11 while, for NIR phosphorescent transition-metal complexes, there are rare successful examples. Therefore, more attention should be spent on the development of appropriate DA-based transition-metal complexes. (6) To date, the study on NIR phosphorescent transition-metal complexes mainly focus on λem ranging 700 to 1000 nm. Phosphorescent transition-metal complexes with λem longer than 1000 nm are scarce. The longer λem with high ΦP is eagerly expected. Of course, it is not always true that the longer λem is better. Moreover, at any time, it should be kept in mind that the longer λem would lead to the lower ΦP and shorter τ, tentatively rationalized by the low energy gap of which the radiation-less deactivation may be governed by the large amplitude vibration.When this review was prepared, a new study482 demonstrated another strategy for obtaining long-lived triplet excited state by excited states intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) in a series of naphthalimides conjugated with 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl) benzothiazole (Fig. 87). For these purely organic chromophores, the absence of heavy-atom SOC effects leads to no phosphorescence but strong red-shifted fluorescence at RT. However, very long-lived triplet excited states up to 124.5 μs are observed by transient absorption analysis. It is interesting that these long-lived triplet excited states are also sensitive to oxygen, which might be a new direction for the design of oxygen probes and will inspire more investigations into this fascinating field in the use of long-lived triplet excited states (beyond phosphorescence).
