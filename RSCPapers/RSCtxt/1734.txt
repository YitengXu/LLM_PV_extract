    , Accepted 17th January 2014First published on 20th January 2014AbstractThe utilization of CO2 for production of solar fuels/chemicals is gaining increasing importance due to worldwide fossil-fuel shortage and global warming. As a means to achieve this, we herein report on the synthesis and development of a graphene-based visible light active photocatalyst (CCG–BODIPY) which is chemically converted graphene (CCG) covalently bonded to a light harvesting BODIPY molecule (1-picolylamine-2-aminophenyl-3-oxy-phenyl-4,4′-difluoro-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-2,6-diethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-triazine). The photocatalyst-biocatalyst coupled system developed using CCG–BODIPY as photocatalyst functions in a highly efficient manner, leading to high NADH regeneration (54.02 ± 0.61%), followed by its consumption in exclusive formic acid production (144.2 ± 1.8 μmol) from CO2. The present research endeavour highlights the development and application of a graphene based photocatalyst for direct solar fuel formation from carbon dioxide.
Introduction
The natural photosynthetic process has fascinated chemists for a long time due to its high specificity in solar energy conversion to sugar. However, given the structural and functional complexity, it is a challenge to mimic this natural process.1,2 Nonetheless, efforts to develop efficient photosynthesis mimetic systems have been going on since 1970s.3 In recent years, these efforts have intensified due to increasing emphasis on the development of carbon-free or carbon-neutral systems/technologies for production of solar fuels/chemicals.
Utilizing the natural photosynthesis as a blueprint, a number of covalent, and non-covalent donor–acceptor conjugate dyes have been studied as systems for CO2 fixation. Although capable of efficient photoinduced intra- and intermolecular electron transfer (ET), they suffer from poor conversion efficiency and lack photostability.4–7 For enhanced efficiency and photostability, a variety of photocatalytic materials, such as inorganic frameworks and metal complexes have been developed and evaluated.8–12 However, their direct utilization remains limited due to one or more reasons, which include, low NADH regeneration, poor selectivity, limited photostability and inability to work in visible light. This has led to emergence of the coupling of a suitable visible light active photocatalyst to an enzyme as an exciting avenue of research in this area.13,14 In this regard, we have recently reported the successful development of a photocatalyst–enzyme coupled system for CO2 fixation leading to direct synthesis of solar chemicals.15 However, persistent research efforts are required to fine tune such coupled systems for realistic use in near future. It is therefore imperative to rationally develop a visible light harvesting and photostable photocatalyst–enzyme coupled system capable of high NADH regeneration and selective solar fuel/chemical production (Scheme 1) from CO2 using visible light.

Currently, graphene is at the hub of significant experimental, and theoretical research studies due to its unique properties, and promising applications.16 Indeed, the properties lead to remarkable efficiency in the transport of charge and thermal carriers (i.e., collective excitation–phonons). It should be noted here that charge transport and excellent charge carrier mobility (2.5 × 105 cm2 V−1 s−1) at interfaces play an important role in the basic properties of not only physical, chemical, and biological but also photocatalytic, and photovoltaic systems. Moreover, the BET surface area of graphene provides a large number of surface active sites to the photocatalyst, and easier generation of charge transport carriers, leading to higher efficiencies.17 Therefore, chemically converted graphene (CCG) which has a BET surface area of 254 m2 g−1 may play a vital role in improving the performance of a photocatalyst.
Despite the favourable BET surface area, poor photoinduced electron/energy transfer property places a limitation on the use of graphene based systems as photocatalysts.18 A limited amount of success could be achieved in CCG using strategies such as, p-/n-type doping, and band gap engineering so far.19,20 In recent years, a few promising examples on covalent functionalization of graphene with chromophores, such as, porphyrin have been reported.21,22 This effectively disturbs π-conjugation of the gapless graphene, giving rise to significant energy band gap, leading to photoinduced electron/energy transfer from the chromophore to graphene.17,23–25 Whatsoever, intensive research efforts are required to fully realize the potential of this approach.
Although, a number of factors, including photostability may play a role in the success of CCG–chromophore coupled photocatalysts, highly efficient light harvesting and energy transfer by chromophores to CCG is of vital importance. As a result, selection and incorporation of suitably tailored chromophore systems is necessary while developing these photocatalysts. Among a large variety of chromophores, difluoro-boraindacene (BODIPY family) discovered by Treibs and Kreuzer in 1968 is one of the most studied families due to synthetic tractability and attractive electronic properties.26,27 Thus, a tailored BODIPY system superior to the reported chromophores may be obtained using inexpensive starting materials in a fairly straightforward manner, leading to an efficient graphene based photocatalyst.
This report describes the successful development of a highly competent light harvesting CCG–BODIPY photocatalyst for CO2 fixation by utilizing solar energy. For this research work, 1-picolylamine-2-aminophenyl-3-oxy-phenyl-4,4′-difluoro-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-2,6-diethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-triazine (hereinafter BODIPY) was prepared. In addition to straightforward and economical synthesis, the other salient features of the BODIPY system include: (a) high molar extinction coefficient; (b) long excited state lifetime; (c) efficient energy transfer; and (d) photochemical stability. The resultant CCG–BODIPY photocatalyst obtained by covalent attachment of BODIPY to CCG, exhibited superior performance over the earlier reported photocatalysts such as CCG–NH–TPP in NADH regeneration, and exclusive production of formic acid from CO2, enzymatically, utilizing visible light.10–12,21
Experimental
Photoelectrochemical measurements
Photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out in a three-armed cell consisting of reference (Ag/AgCl, BASI, MF-2063 RE-5), working (CCG–BODIPY photoanode) and Platinum wire (Part number: CHI115) counter electrodes using a electrochemical analyzer (CHI Instruments 1100A). 0.1 M NaCl solution containing 0.4 M triethanolamine (TEOA) was used as a redox couple/electrolyte. Newport solar simulator (69911) was used as a light source. Light intensity was measured by VSLI standard incorporated Oriel P/N 91150V.
Photocatalytic NADH production
The photochemical regeneration of NADH was performed within a quartz reactor under an inert atmosphere at room temperature, using a 450 W Xenon lamp (Newport 66921) with a 420 nm cut-off-filter as a light source. The photocatalytic regeneration of NADH was carried out as follows. The reaction was performed in a quartz reactor. The reaction consisted of β-NAD+ (1.24 μmol), rhodium complex Rh (0.62 μmol), TEOA (1.24 mmol) and photocatalyst (0.5 mg) in 3.1 mL of sodium phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 7.0). The regeneration of NADH was monitored by UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-1800, Shimadzu).
Measurement of the quantum yield
The quantum yield (ΦY) was calculated according to the following formula:ΦY = 2× (moles of NADH produced/moles of incident photon).
The quantum yield of CCG–BODIPY photocatalyst was calculated to be 0.096 (9.6%) for the photocatalytic NADH regeneration process (details in the ESI†).
Formic acid production as solar fuel from CO2
The formation of formic acid from CO2 was also performed within a quartz reactor under an inert atmosphere at room temperature, using a 450 W Xenon lamp with a 420 nm cut-off-filter as light source. The reaction consisted of photocatalyst (0.5 mg), β-NAD+ (1.24 μmol), rhodium complex Rh (0.62 μmol) and formate dehydrogenase (3 units) in 3.1 mL of sodium phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 7.0) with TEOA (1.24 mmol) in the presence of CO2 (flow rate: 0.5 mL min−1). After bubbling CO2 for 1 h in the absence of light (light off), the reactor was exposed to visible light (light on). The amount of formic acid was detected by GC (7890A, Agilent Technologies).15
Results and discussion
Photocatalyst–biocatalyst coupled system for formic acid production as solar fuel
A diagrammatic illustration of the photocatalyst–enzyme coupled system involved in the formation of formic acid from CO2 is depicted in Scheme 1. The light-harvesting BODIPY (as an electron donor) collects incident photons as an electronic transition between a localized orbital around it (HOMO to LUMO) and conducts via graphene (as a multi electron acceptor) to reduce the rhodium complex Rh ([Cp*Rh(bpy)H2O]2+; Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl, bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine).28 Upon reduction, the rhodium complex abstracts a proton from aqueous solution and transfers a hydride ion to NAD+, which in turn gets converted into NADH, thus completing the photocatalytic cycle. In this way, Rh behaves as an electron mediator between the graphene based photocatalyst and NAD+ leading to regeneration of NADH cofactor. Finally, NADH is consumed in the enzymatic (formate dehydrogenase) conversion of CO2 substrate to formic acid. The NAD+ thus released again acts as a substrate for the photocatalytic cycle, leading to photoregeneration of NADH. The photocatalytic–enzymatic cycles thus couple integrally, exclusively yielding formic acid as the final product from CO2.
Characterization of CCG–BODIPY photocatalyst
The XRD patterns of graphene (CCG), BODIPY and CCG–BODIPY photocatalyst are shown in ESI, Fig. S1.† The pattern for CCG exhibited a weak and broad characteristic peak at 2θ value of 26.0°. This peak corresponds to 0.343 nm of interlayer spacing (d-spacing) in CCG which is close to that of natural graphite (0.335 nm).29a The comparatively higher value of interlayer spacing in CCG as compared to graphite indicates the presence of a small number of carboxyl (–COOH) groups in CCG.29b Concurrently, the scattering peak at 19.961° for BODIPY corresponds to d-spacing of 0.444 nm.30 A shift in the scattering peaks to 17.950° (weak) and 25.859° (broad) in the XRD pattern of CCG–BODIPY may be attributed to BODIPY intercalation arising from amide (–CON–) bond formation between the carboxyl group of CCG and the amino group of BODIPY system. The existence of an amide bond was clearly confirmed by other characterization techniques, as described in details later.31
The 3D structure of CCG–BODIPY photocatalyst along with the atomic force microscopy (AFM), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images of CCG and CCG–BODIPY are shown in Fig. 1. The samples for AFM explorations were prepared by drop-casting ultrasonicated solutions (0.00027 g L−1 in DMF) of CCG and CCG–BODIPY on an unsoiled glass surface. The topographic average roughness of CCG and CCG–BODIPY was found to be 0.924 nm and 1.651 nm, respectively (Fig. 1a). It indicates that the edge of CCG has been roughened by coverage of soft material, thereby confirming covalent attachment of BODIPY. The height (section analysis) of plateaus of CCG–BODIPY was higher than CCG (0.444 nm approx.), which provided confirmation for the coupling of CCG to BODIPY through an amide bond (Fig. S2, ESI†).32 The surface morphology of CCG and CCG–BODIPY was also studied by HR-TEM (Fig. 1c). The results indicate that CCG existed in a single layer which underwent a change in the surface morphology after the covalent attachment of BODIPY.33

The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and pore structure of CCG and CCG–BODIPY were investigated using adsorption–desorption measurements. As shown in Fig. 2, the BET surface area (SBET) of CCG–BODIPY (163.2363 m2 g−1) is lesser than CCG (250.0127 m2 g−1), due to the coupling of CCG to BODIPY molecule. The high specific surface area provides a large number of surface active sites, band gap opening and makes charge carrier transport easier, leading to enhancement in the photocatalytic activity.34 Thus, CCG may play a role in enhancing the photocatalytic activity for the newly synthesised light harvesting CCG–BODIPY system.
 Fig. 2  Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and corresponding pore size distribution curves (inset) of CCG and CCG–BODIPY. 
The shape of hysteresis loop is of type H3, linked with silt-like pores formed by the collection of wave-like particles,35 supported further by the AFM, and HR-TEM results (Fig. 1). Additionally, the isotherms exhibited high absorption at high relative pressure (P/P0) range (forthcoming 1.0), indicating the formation of big mesopores. These results were further confirmed by the corresponding pore size distribution. The CCG has a Langmuir surface area of 348.0846 m2 g−1 and a pore volume of 1.3618 cm3 g−1 while CCG–BODIPY has a Langmuir surface area of 231.5121 m2 g−1 and a pore volume of 0.9405 cm3 g−1 (Fig. 2). The peak pore diameter of CCG–BODIPY is in the range of 2.2 to 10 nm, which further confirms the existence of an amide (–CON–) bond. Indeed, the lower SBET, pore volume and Langmuir surface area of CCG–BODIPY suggests that it may be an excellent photocatalyst.36
The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) studies provided further evidence for the coupling of BODIPY with CCG. The spectrum of CCG (Fig. 3a) exhibited characteristic bands at 1060 cm−1 (νC–O), 1210–1225 cm−1 (νphenolic), 1370 cm−1 (νO–H bending in tertiary alcohol) and 1620 cm−1 (νHOH bending in water). In addition, the peak at 1720 cm−1 was assigned to carbonyl stretching (νCO) of the carboxylic group (–COOH).37 The appearance of a strong and broad band at about 3400–3500 cm−1 further confirmed the presence of carboxylic group in CCG.38 In the spectrum of CCG–BODIPY (Fig. 3a), absence of a peak at 1720 cm−1 and concomitant emergence of new bands at 1613 and 1299–1206 cm−1 assigned to the carbonyl (νCO) and carbon–nitrogen (νC–N) stretching, respectively, of the amide group confirmed the coupling of BODIPY to CCG.39.40 In addition, the bands at 2864, 1512–1613, 1981, and 1084 cm−1 were assigned to the stretching of –CH2–, –CC–, –CH2CH3 and B–N groups, respectively.39,40

The thermal behavior of CCG and CCG–BODIPY was studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Fig. 3b) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. 3c). DSC was performed at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 under nitrogen in the temperature range of 25–400 °C while TGA was carried out in the temperature range of 25–900 °C. The DSC thermogram of CCG exhibited only one endothermic peak at 194.89 °C (ΔH = 1172 J g−1). Following the coupling of BODIPY with CCG, the DSC thermogram exhibited two exothermic peaks at 138.36 °C (ΔH = −1172 J g−1) and 238.25 °C (ΔH = −342.9 J g−1). The TGA (heating rate: 5 °C min−1 under nitrogen) curve for CCG exhibited slow weight loss with increase in temperature up to 800 °C.41 On the other hand, a three-step weight loss was observed in CCG–BODIPY. A steady weight loss up to 18.92% in the temperature range of 25 °C to around 210 °C corresponds to the typical pattern of sidewall functionalization. This was followed by the second (23.38%) and third (41.66%) major weight loss in the temperature range of 250 °C to near about 710 °C (Fig. 3c) with an exothermic peak appearing at around 238.25–269.64 °C in the DSC curve (Fig. 3b) indicating breakage of the amide bonds of CCG–BODIPY system.42 From the TGA analysis, the degree of functionalization was estimated to be one BODIPY group per 301 carbon atoms of CCG.
Raman spectroscopy is a powerful tool to investigate the structure of CCG and CCG–BODIPY (Fig. S3, ESI†). The Raman spectrum of CCG exhibited two intense peaks at 1340 and 1577 cm−1, corresponding to the D and G bands, respectively.43 On the other hand, D and G bands in CCG–BODIPY appeared at 1343 and 1565 cm−1, respectively. The shift in peak position of D (3 cm−1) and G (12 cm−1) bands confirmed a covalent attachment of BODIPY to CCG.43 There are many factors such as defects, strains, and coupling, etc. which affect the position of the G band.44 However, it should be noted that D band up-shifts, while G band down-shifts on creation of new amide carbonyl groups and these shifts are enhanced with an increase in N–C atomic ratio.45
The covalent coupling of BODIPY to CCG was also confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). There were small changes in the binding energy of carbon sharing in C–O, CO and O–CO species after attachment of BODIPY through amide bond (Fig. S4, ESI†). The intensity of the three N1s peaks observed around 400 eV was poor and suggested the presence of a small amount of nitrogen. Of the three, the peaks at 397.8 and 398.9 eV were assigned to N–N and N–Csp3, respectively.40 The third peak at 404 eV matches well the reported values for N–Csp2 of the amide bond (approximately 405.0 eV).46 The O1s peak at 530 eV after BODIPY attachment to CCG indicated the presence of OC-bond along with C–N bond (from N1s peaks).47 Moreover, full width half maximum (FWHM) of the peak attributed to C–N bond appeared reasonably larger than the other C components.48 This confirmed the formation of an amide bond in place of the carboxyl group. In contrast, no N1s and F1s peaks were observed in the XPS spectrum of CCG. This further confirmed the coupling of BODIPY to CCG. Further details of the characterization of BODIPY, CCG–BODIPY, NH2–TPP and CCG–NH–TPP are provided in the ESI.†
The UV-visible spectra of BODIPY and CCG–BODIPY, along with that of NH2–TPP and CCG–NH–TPP for comparison are shown in Fig. 4. The NH2–TPP and CCG–NH–TPP exhibited a Soret band at 419 nm and weak Q-bands in the range of 500 to 700 nm. On the other hand, Q-bands of BODIPY and CCG–BODIPY (524 nm) were broader with higher absorbance at the same concentration. The red-shift in absorbance maxima and broadening of Q-band in BODIPY/CCG–BODIPY in comparison to NH2–TPP/CCG–NH–TPP suggests presence of strong inter-molecular interactions in CCG–BODIPY and BODIPY.

Photocatalytic NADH regeneration and production of formic acid from CO2
A series of experiments were carried out to examine BODIPY, and CCG–BODIPY photocatalyst for visible light-driven photo-regeneration of NADH. For comparative purposes, the photocatalytic NADH regeneration ability of NH2–TPP and CCG–NH–TPP was also studied. The concentration of photo-regenerated NADH was measured by UV-visible spectroscopy in all cases. As shown in Fig. 5a, CCG–BODIPY was appreciably successful in NADH photo-regeneration with constant accumulation up to 54.02% with time linearity. On the other hand, BODIPY, NH2–TPP, and CCG–NH–TPP photocatalyst provided only 10.81, 7.60, and 20.98% of NADH regeneration, respectively. Additional experiments were performed to study the photocatalytic performance of BODIPY, CCG–BODIPY, NH2–TPP, and CCG–NH–TPP for the visible light driven production of formic acid from CO2. The amount of formic acid was estimated by gas chromatography (GC). As shown in Fig. 5b, the formic acid yield increased linearly with reaction time when CCG–BODIPY was used as a photocatalyst. Among the four photocatalysts, CCG–BODIPY photocatalyst produced the highest amount of formic acid (144.2 μmol) from CO2 under visible light. The exclusive formation of formic acid in a high amount clearly reveals the superiority of CCG–BODIPY over the other studied photocatalysts. Therefore, CCG–BODIPY is an excellent light harvesting photocatalyst.
 Fig. 5  Photocatalytic activities of BODIPY, CCG–BODIPY, NH2–TPP, and CCG–NH–TPP photocatalyst for (a) NADH regeneration [β-NAD+ (1.24 μmol), Rh (0.62 μmol), TEOA (1.24 mmol) and photocatalyst (0.5 mg) in 3.1 mL of sodium phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 7.0)] and (b) Selective enzymatic production of formic acid from CO2 (flow rate: 0.5 mL min−1) under visible light [β-NAD+ (1.24 μmol), Rh (0.62 μmol), TEOA (1.24 mmol), photocatalyst (0.5 mg) and formate dehydrogenase (3 units) in 3.1 mL of sodium phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 7.0)]. 
A set of control experiments in the absence of Rh and/or NAD+ were also carried out. However no formic acid formation was observed in these cases. This confirmed the vital role of Rh and NAD+ in the functioning of this system. Overall, these results prompted us to further carry out the electrochemical studies.
Cyclic voltammetry studies
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) provides a useful insight into the mechanism of the process. Therefore, we studied the electrochemical properties of CCG–BODIPY and Rh with CV and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) using glassy carbon (working), silver–silver chloride (reference) and platinum (counter) electrodes at pH 7.0 in a phosphate buffer (100 mM).
The reduction potential of Rh and CCG–BODIPY was found to be about −0.71 V (Fig. 6a) and −1.02 V (Fig. S7, ESI†), respectively.
 Fig. 6  Cyclic voltammograms of (a) rhodium complex (Rh) (0.2 mM), CCG–BODIPY (10 μM), and Rh with NAD+ (0.4 mM) solutions and (b) mixture of two components (Rh and CCG–BODIPY) in the presence and absence of NAD+ (0.4 mM). The potential was scanned at 100 mV s−1 using glassy carbon (working), silver–silver chloride (reference) and platinum (counter) electrodes in sodium phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 7.0). 
A change in CV voltammogram was observed when the two components (Rh and CCG–BODIPY) were present together in solution. It can be attributed to the interactions between Rh and CCG–BODIPY photocatalyst. The reduction was observed at −0.82 V, a cathodic shift of Rh reduction (Fig. 6b). It can also be interpreted as an anodic shift of CCG–BODIPY reduction. The CCG–BODIPY–Rh complex also revealed a strong increase in the reduction peak current with NAD+, implying that the system consisting of CCG–BODIPY and Rh was able to catalyze the reduction of NAD+ (Fig. 6b). It has previously been reported that the catalytic effect of Rh results in a strongly increased rate of Rh reduction in presence of NAD+.49,50 The absence of an oxidation peak further indicated that CCG–BODIPY–Rh complex followed the electrochemistry of Rh (two-electron reduction followed by chemical protonation).
The photoelectrical behavior of CCG–BODIPY may be held responsible for the catalytic activity of CCG–BODIPY–Rh complex as the excited electron of CCG–BODIPY could be easily transferred to Rh. According to researchers,13 the photoelectrical property of hybrid light harvesting molecule originates from the excitation of electrons from highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), followed by transfer of the excited electrons into the rhodium complex. In the present case, following the photoexcitation of the CCG–BODIPY electron from HOMO (E = −5.48 eV) to LUMO (E = −3.64 eV), it cascades into Rh (E = −3.96 eV) without radiation (e.g., fluorescence). The vicinity and potential gradient between the light harvesting CCG–BODIPY photocatalyst and electrocatalytic Rh center enables this efficient electron transfer from the former to the latter. The resultant electrically reduced Rh, [Cp*Rh(bpy)] is chemically protonated in aqueous media, followed by its catalytic reaction with NAD+ leading to NADH regeneration (54.02%).
Photocurrent measurement
The transient photocurrent was measured on a photo electro-chemical test device fabricated by drop casting the covalently attached CCG–BODIPY system dispersed in ethanol (0.01 g mL−1) onto fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass. Fig. 7 shows the photocurrent response versus time graph of BODIPY, CCG–BODIPY, NH2–TPP, and CCG–NH–TPP. The photocurrent of CCG–BODIPY photocatalyst was found to be the highest (∼7.5 μA cm−2), as compared to the other three tested systems. Moreover, the photocurrent response of CCG–BODIPY was reasonably reversible as the current increased reproducibly on each irradiation and recovered quickly in the dark.
 Fig. 7  Photocurrent–time (I–T) profiles of FTO/BODIPY, FTO/CCG–BODIPY, FTO/NH2–TPP, and FTO/CCG–NH–TPP electrodes under simulated solar light (1 sun) illumination (three electrodes; scan rate 50 mV s−1; input power: 100 mW cm−2; and electrolyte: 0.1 M NaCl in water; bias potential: 0 to 0.1 V (vs. Ag/AgCl)). 
The high photocurrent is responsible for the photocatalytic activity of CCG–BODIPY under simulated solar light.49 During our studies, the anodic photoinduced response of CCG–BODIPY was measured only on irradiation by simulated solar light (one sun) (Fig. 7). This indicates that the electrons excited by simulated solar light were transferred from sacrificial agent triethanolamine (TEOA) to the FTO glass through the CCG–BODIPY photocatalyst. Therefore, CCG–BODIPY acts as an efficient photoactive molecule for generating photocurrent through a favourable energetic relationship with TEOA.50 In addition, the charge transfer mechanism may also be held responsible for higher NADH regeneration and solar fuel formation by CCG–BODIPY photocatalyst.
Density functional theory calculations of electronic structures
To elucidate the origin of the photocatalytic activity and the activity enhancement of the graphene-based photocatalyst (CCG–BODIPY), we performed a series of first principles calculations using plane-wave based density functional theory (DFT) code, VASP.51 To overcome the computational limit imposed by the large size of molecular system, we divided the CCG–BODIPY into two parts, CCG composed of 30 benzene rings and BODIPY molecule, which were saturated by carboxyl and amine groups, respectively, and then we performed electronic structure calculations separately (Fig. 8). In order to compare distinct electron levels in different molecules, we have calculated the first ionization potential of each molecule, i.e., the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital and the vacuum level.
 Fig. 8  Visualization of the molecular orbitals of BODIPY; (a) LUMO and (b) HOMO as obtained from DFT calculations. 
The incident light is absorbed at BODIPY, where photoexcitation occurs, and the created electrons move into the CCG via stable amide bond. The amide bond guarantees stable operation of the photocatalyst and easy electron transfer between the chromophore and graphene. The electron transfer efficiency could be estimated by the energy level alignment between the Fermi level of CCG and the LUMO of BODIPY. From our DFT calculation results, we have confirmed that the energy level of each segment is aligned for electrons to transfer from BODIPY finally to the hydrogen reduction site via CCG. The Fermi level of graphene, which is calculated to be 4.15 eV lower than the vacuum level, lies around the center of the bandgap, about 1.10 eV lower than the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of BODIPY. The calculated bandgap is 1.85 eV which is in close agreement with the experimental value obtained from CV studies (1.84 eV). The transferred electrons in graphene are hot electrons because of the large potential difference of the LUMO of BODIPY and the Fermi level of graphene. Hot electrons are known to be very active and able to travel around long distance. By the usage of triethanolamine (TEOA) as a hole scavenger, the electron transfer from CCG to the photoexcited BODIPY is not allowed. Thus, the photoexcited electrons created in BODIPY can be easily transferred into CCG, irreversibly (details in the ESI†).
Decay profile study
In order to gain insight into the electronic transformation between the two moieties (CCG and BODIPY), the ultrafast photoinduced dynamics of the CCG–BODIPY nanohybrid excited state were examined by a single photon counting control technique. From the decay time-profiles shown in Fig. 9, data of the photoexcited BODIPY in CCG–BODIPY was curve-fitted using biexponential decay kinetics, from which lifetimes of 597 ps (48.78%), and 1178 ps (51.22%) were deduced. These values are shorter than the lifetime of intact BODIPY (2156 ps; 100%). Thus it is reasonable to assume a charge-separation (electron transfer–CS) and charge recombination (hole-transfer–CR) rate constant scenario in the CCG–BODIPY via BODIPY*.52
 Fig. 9  Decay profiles of the excitation emission of BODIPY (red) and CCG–BODIPY (black) in DMF medium obtained using the time-correlated single-photon counting control technique. Intensities are normalized for comparison with each other (λexcitation = 525 nm). 
In CCG–BODIPY, the effective CS (1.7 × 1011 s−1) and CR (1.0 × 1011 s−1) rate constants are influenced by the extended π-conjugation operating between CCG and BODIPY moieties by a through bond mechanism via the interconnecting amide bond (details in ESI†).52,53 The ultrafast charge separation rate suggests the possibility of hot electron injection and multiexciton dissociation from the newly synthesized CCG–BODIPY photocatalyst, consistent with recent reports of these phenomena at the photocatalyst interface. These rates are also responsible for one-pot exclusive conversion of CO2 into formic acid by a coupled enzyme, utilizing the NADH generated from NAD+ using a newly synthesized CCG–BODIPY photocatalyst.
Conclusions
In summary, the present work describes a newly synthesized robust CCG–BODIPY photocatalyst for solar fuel formation. The photocatalyst was well characterized by spectroscopy, thermal analysis, and microscopic studies. The presence of a highly efficient solar light harvesting BODIPY system may be held responsible for the excellent photocatalytic activity of CCG–BODIPY leading to a high NADH regeneration yield of 54.02% and exclusive formic acid formation (144.2 μmol) from CO2. The present investigations clearly reveal the superiority of the graphene-based photocatalyst (CCG–BODIPY) over the reported photocatalysts, such as graphene–TPP. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on a light harvesting CCG–BODIPY photocatalyst and sets a new benchmark in the area of artificial photosynthesis for solar fuel production. Overall, the present work provides a promising new direction to artificial photosynthesis by graphene based materials.
