    , Accepted 20th September 2019First published on 21st September 2019AbstractThe development of low-cost, selective, and active catalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) remains an ongoing challenge. Here, we demonstrate for the first time, efficient ECR by exploiting interaction of CuO and In2O3. The catalytic properties of the composite catalysts can be readily tuned by manipulation of the metal oxide composition and interface, enabling remarkably high CO2-to-CO conversion with a CO faradaic efficiency of about 93.0% at −0.7 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, outperforming many previously reported metal-based electrocatalysts.
The problem of global warming caused by excessive carbon dioxide emissions becomes ever increasingly serious. Utilization and conversion of CO2 for producing fuels and value-added chemicals, especially through electrolysis, offers a promising strategy to alleviate this situation. Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) can be performed by coupling CO2 conversion technologies with renewable intermittent sources of energy such as wind and solar power, allowing a potential carbon-neutral economy.1–8 To date, one of the crucial challenges for electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 is to improve selectivity and yield of targeted products. To this end, the design and development of new electrocatalysts are the key. Indeed, the past few years have witnessed enormous effort in the search and design of various electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction.9–14 In particular, noble metals such as Au, Ag, Pd, and Pt have been reported for ECR to yield CO during ECR. However, their high cost and scarcity impose unfavorable limitations on the prospects of their practical application in ECR.
Creation and engineering of heterostructures with different phases provides an effective way for achieving enhanced catalysis. Bimetallic structures have been shown to facilitate electrochemical CO2 conversion by optimizing interactions of CO2 molecules and its reaction intermediates.15–17 Alternatively, tuning of metal/(hydro) oxide interactions has been widely utilized to improve the kinetics of gas-phase chemical catalysis,18–20 however, similar concepts are much less investigated for electrocatalysis in the liquid phase.21–25 There have only been a few examples in the area of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. Pérez-Ramírez et al. have reported Cu/In(OH)326 and Ag/In(OH)327 catalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO exhibiting a current efficiency of about 57% and 50%, in contrast to bulk Cu–In and Ag with a current efficiency of only 6% and 2%, respectively. More recently, Sun and co-workers have found that coating of Cu nanoparticles with a 0.8 nm-thick SnOx shell could enhance the catalytic product selectivity from hydrocarbon-favourable to highly CO-selective with a CO FE of ca. 90.0%.28 These findings demonstrate that metal/(hydro) oxide interfaces, if properly designed, can positively influence the electrocatalytic kinetics of CO2 reduction. By analogy, tailoring metal oxide/metal oxide interface is also expected to achieve enhanced CO2 electrolysis. However, this area remains rarely explored.
Herein we report for the first time, that coupling of CuO with In2O3 supported on N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) can dramatically prompt electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to produce CO. In contrast to pure CuO and In2O3 that both catalyze ECR with CO FEs of less than 32.0%, the metal oxide composite catalyst can deliver a CO FE as high as 93.0% at −0.7 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) with a CO partial current density of 4.3 mA cm−2. The CO2-to-CO conversion can be readily regulated by varying the Cu–In/oxide mole ratio (composition), metal oxide loading, and feeding sequence (surface structure) of the metal salt precursors.
In this work, a simple wet chemical synthesis method was employed to prepare CuO and In2O3 composite catalysts with tunable composition, metal oxide loading, and structure (for details, see Table S1, ESI†). The NCNTs not only serve as a catalyst support to anchor and disperse the metal oxide particles but can also provide electron conduction paths during electrocatalysis. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of CuO–In2O3/NCNTs together with CuO/NCNTs and In2O3/NCNTs are given in Fig. 1a. Typical CuO diffraction peaks at about 35.1 and 38.0° corresponding to the (002) and (111) planes, respectively were observed for CuO–In2O3/NCNTs, indicating the formation of crystalline CuO in the composite. A slight shift of the CuO diffraction peaks to higher 2θ degrees relative to those of CuO/NCNTs was observed (inset of Fig. 1a), suggesting occurrence of interaction between CuO and In2O3. Unlike In2O3/NCNTs that displayed representative In2O3 peaks, no diffraction peaks of any In compounds were identified for CuO–In2O3/NCNTs, likely due to the low loading and/or small size of In2O3 in the composite.

(c) H2-TPR profiles of In2O3/NCNTs, CuO/NCNTs, and CuO–In2O3/NCNTs. The Cu-to-In mole ratio in CuO–In2O3/NCNTs is 30:1 in all the cases. 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to characterize the surface composition and chemical environment of the as-made CuO–In2O3/NCNTs (Fig. S1, ESI†). The Cu 2p core-level spectrum of CuO/NCNTs exhibits clear CuO features: Cu 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 peaks with binding energies (BEs) at 953.8 and 933.9 eV, respectively, with their corresponding satellite peaks (Fig. 1b).4 Notably, the Cu 2p BEs in CuO–In2O3/NCNTs shifted to lower values compared with the BEs of CuO/NCNTs (Fig. 1b), which can be ascribed to the compressive strain-triggered electronic structure change of CuO induced by the lattice constant mismatch of the interface between In2O3 and CuO (electron transfer from Cu to In). The CuO–In2O3/NCNTs sample shows In 3d doublets at 444.9 and 452.5 eV (Fig. S2, ESI†), which correspond to the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 electrons of In(III) in In2O3, respectively (the BEs of the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 electrons for metallic In are 444.0 and 451.5 eV, respectively).29,30
Temperature-programmed reduction by hydrogen (H2-TPR) profiles show a more pronounced peak at about 173 °C assigned to the reduction of Cuδ+ to Cu+ by consuming reducible oxygen from the CuOx species for CuO–In2O3/NCNTs relative to CuO/NCNTs, as illustrated in Fig. 1c. In addition, the reduction starts from a noticeable lower temperature. These phenomena suggest much easier reduction of Cuδ+ in the former sample than the latter one, which is likely a result of electron transfer from In2O3 to CuO, consistent with XPS results.
The composition, morphology, phase, and microstructure of the resulting composite were further characterized by transition electron microscopy (TEM). Aberration corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) observation (Fig. 2a–c) showed the formation of many nanoparticles (NPs) deposited on NCNTs. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) maps (Fig. 2d–h and Fig. S3b–f, S4, ESI†) along with the EDS spectrum (Fig. 2i) confirmed that the NPs were composed of CuO and In2O3 crystallites. High-resolution TEM images revealed good crystallinity of the metal oxide NPs. The lattice spacing of the NP was determined to be about 0.234 nm (Fig. 2j), in good agreement with the (111) plane spacing of CuO (Fig. 2k).4 This suggests that In2O3 unlikely altered the CuO lattice structure in the composites.

The metal oxide composite catalysts were examined for ECR in 0.1 M aqueous KHCO3 using an H-type cell separated by a Nafion membrane.31 Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of CuO–In2O3/NCNTs in Ar- and CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 solutions are shown in Fig. 3a. Apparently, CuO–In2O3/NCNTs exhibits remarkably enhanced current densities in the CO2-saturated electrolyte than in the Ar-saturated one. The catalysts manifest an interesting composition-dependent product selectivity (Fig. 3b). As the In2O3 content increases, the CuO–In2O3/NCNTs catalyst becomes more and more selective for CO production before reaching a peak value of CO selectivity with a Cu-to-In mole ratio of 30:1. Whereas further increase of In2O3 fraction in the catalyst lowers CO FE but improves the selectivity for HCOOH. Pure In2O3/NCNTs mainly reduces CO2 to HCOOH with a FE of 53.0%. Therefore, given the fact that pure CuO supported on NCNTs catalyses CO2 reduction with a CO FE of only 31.0% and an HCOOH FE of 1.1%, it is evident that incorporation of a small amount of In2O3 into the composite catalyst structure can substantially improve the catalytic performance.

The CO FEs and partial current densities at different applied potentials on CuO–In2O3/NCNTs with a Cu-to-In mole ratio of 30:1 were investigated and the results are presented in Fig. 3c. A volcano-shaped evolution of CO selectivity is clearly seen over the studied potential range of −0.5 V to −1.0 V (vs. RHE). The CO FE increases from 70.0% at −0.5 V to 92.0% at −0.7 V and then decreases with further increase of overpotential. This trend is also consistent with the results reported in literature for polycrystalline Cu26 and some oxide-derived Cu catalysts.32–34 For the CuO–In2O3/NCNTs catalyst with a Cu-to-In mole ratio of 30:1, CO was the only major reduction product in the entire studied potential range. The distinctive preference for CO formation and inhibition of the HER implies alteration of the catalytic nature of CuO after In2O3 deposition.
To probe the possible collaborative effect of Cu/In oxide interface on catalytic properties, we further compared CuO–In2O3/NCNTs with pure CuO/NCNTs, In2O3/NCNTs and physically mixed CuO/NCNTs and In2O3/NCNTs (CuO–In2O3/NCNTs-mix) for ECR in the potential range from −0.5 to −1.0 V. The CuO–In2O3/NCNTs was found to exhibit remarkably higher activity than the other three catalysts (Fig. 3c and d), suggesting a synergism between the two metal oxides that facilitated CO2-to-CO conversion. Note that the CuO–In2O3/NCNTs also strikingly outperforms NCNTs in terms of both CO faradaic efficiency and CO partial current density (Fig. 3c and d). This highlights the predominant role of the metal oxides for ECR and also rules out the decisive effect of the possible CNT growth catalyst remaining on the ECR.
We also studied the effect of metallic oxide loading on NCNTs for ECR under a constant Cu-to-In mole ratio (30:1). The composite catalyst with a (CuO–In2O3) loading of 65.0 wt% afforded the best performance (Fig. 3e), delivering a CO FE of about 92.0% and a CO partial current density of 4.3 mA cm−2 at −0.7 V. The ECR activity was further optimized by modulating the concentration and feeding sequence of the metal salt precursors (Table S2, ESI†), providing a maximum CO FE of ca. 93.0% at −0.7 V. The as-prepared CuO–In2O3/NCNTs exhibited a Tafel slope of 157.4 mV dec−1, lower than 167.9 mV dec−1 for In2O3/NCNTs and 212.4 mV dec−1 for CuO/NCNTs (Fig. 3f). This suggests that the formation of the *COOH intermediate on the surface of the catalysts determines the reaction rate and CuO–In2O3/NCNTs has comparatively faster kinetics for CO2 reduction than In2O3/NCNTs and CuO/NCNTs. Stability curves of CuO–In2O3/NCNTs at −0.7 V are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). Notably, the ECR activity was maintained after 10 h of continuous ECR with no obvious decay in CO FE or current density on the CuO–In2O3/NCNTs electrode. XRD (Fig. S6, ESI†) and XPS analyses (Fig. S7, ESI†) revealed increased fractions of surface Cu0 and In0 with extension of electrolysis due to reduction of the metal oxides at the applied potentials. Metallic Cu0 and In0 may be the major active sites for ECR. As shown in Fig. 3g, our sample surpasses many previously reported electrocatalysts in terms of the FE for CO formation. Fig. S8 (ESI†) shows the Nyquist plots obtained by running the experiment at open circuit potential. The CuO–In2O3/NCNTs sample exhibited a smaller charge transfer resistance than CuO/NCNTs, implying its more favorable charge transfer from the catalyst surface to adsorbed CO2, benefiting ECR.
This work aimed to systematically explore the interplay of composition-dependent effects of the metal oxides (CuO and In2O3) on ECR. The CuO–In2O3 interactions unveiled novel catalytic properties markedly distinct from those of either CuO- or In2O3-based catalysts (Fig. 3b–d). The incorporation of a small quantity of In2O3 into CuO significantly modified its catalytic behaviour, enabling a selective conversion of CO2 to CO (CO FE of up to 93.0%), which starkly contrasts the performance of pure CuO/NCNTs that reduced CO2 to CO with low yield. Therefore, the CuO–In2O3 synergism leads to more active catalytic sites on the catalyst surface, which may be ascribed to electronic and geometric effects. It has been supposed that a good catalyst for ECR to CO should bind *COOH sufficiently strongly to reduce the energy penalty for the reaction but bind *CO (* represents the surface-adsorbed species) weakly to desorb the CO product.35 Enhanced electron density of CuO likely increases the binding strength of *COOH but decreases the affinity of *CO and consequently accelerates CO2 reduction to CO. From the viewpoint of geometric effects, In2O3 is oxophilic, thus benefiting stabilization of the *COOH intermediates that are adsorbed on a neighbouring CuO center by interacting with one of the O atoms. We therefore infer that the synergistic interactions at the CuO–In2O3 interface contribute to the high CO2-to-CO conversion efficiency of CuO–In2O3/NCNTs.
In summary, we report synergistic catalysis of heterostructured CuO–In2O3 supported on NCNTs for efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction. The catalytic properties of the composite could be readily tuned by controlling composition, loading content, and interface structure, with CO2 reduction product adjusted from hydrocarbons to CO. A remarkable CO faradaic efficiency of up to 93.0% was achieved dramatically surpassing CuO, In2O3 or their physical mixture. This enhancement in ECR may be explained by a combined electronic and geometric effects at the metal oxide interface. The synergistic concepts obtained here may provide insights for future design of superior catalysts in energy conversion reactions.
