However, it still remains a great challenge to develop hydrogen storage media with high capacity, favourable thermodynamics, fast kinetics, controllable reversibility, long cycle life, low cost and high safety. To achieve this goal, the combination of lightweight materials and nanostructures should offer great opportunities. In this article, we review recent advances in the field of chemical hydrogen storage that couples lightweight materials and nanostructures, focusing on Mg/MgH2-based systems. Selective theoretical and experimental studies on Mg/MgH2 nanostructures are overviewed, with the emphasis on illustrating the influences of nanostructures on the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation mechanisms and hydrogen storage properties such as capacity, thermodynamics and kinetics. In particular, theoretical studies have shown that the thermodynamics of Mg/MgH2 clusters below 2 nm change more prominently as particle size decreases.

1. Background and introduction
In modern society, the increasing energy needs and environmental crisis urgently demand a transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy resources with clean and efficient energy production, storage, transportation, conversion, and utilization. Hydrogen, the lightest and simplest element in the periodic table of elements, is considered as one of the most important energy carriers for fuel cell-driven portable, mobile, and stationary applications due to the advantages of high energy density (120 MJ kg−1versus 44.4 MJ kg−1 for gasoline), high elemental abundance, and environmentally benign by-product (water).1–4 However, a major obstacle confronting the anticipated future hydrogen economy is the lack of safe, economical and efficient onboard hydrogen storage. Although hydrogen exists in different valence states and compounds that correspond to a variety of strategies to generate and store hydrogen (as shown in Fig. 1), none of current hydrogen storage technologies can fulfil the US Department of Energy (DOE) targets set in 2009 (Table 1).5 Thus, developing reliable media and technologies to efficiently compact hydrogen has been the focus of research efforts for several decades.1–18

Hydrogen storage strategies can be simply classified into physical and chemical routes. Currently, gaseous hydrogen compression and hydrogen liquefaction are the most mature physical hydrogen storage technologies.7 However, they are associated with shortcomings such as high demanding containers and energy-consuming processes. Physical sorption of hydrogen in highly porous solid materials such as active carbons and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) usually need a low operational temperature (near 77 K) to attain reasonable capacity, due to weak interactions between the adsorbents and hydrogen.8–12 Chemical hydrogen storage routes mainly include irreversible water splitting (e.g. hydrolysis, electrolysis, and photolysis, from which hydrogen stored in water can be released on demand), thermolysis of hydrogen-containing compounds (e.g. hydrocarbons), and reversible hydrogenation/dehydrogenation of some metal hydrides or complex hydrides.13–16 In contrast to the physical strategies, chemical hydrogen storage methods related to hydrides often require relatively high operational temperatures, above 400 K because of strong hydrogen bonding in hydrides. From the application point of view, it is highly desirable to quickly store/liberate hydrogen in/from solid materials near ambient temperatures. In principle, a promising hydrogen storage system without prominent kinetic barrier or heat management problem would have a hydrogen binding energy between that of conventional physisorption and chemisorption, namely, in the range of 15–30 kJ mol−1, which is strong enough to hold H2 but weak enough to allow for quick desorption.3,17–19
In this context, intensive efforts in the direction of cryogenic physisorption have been focused on increasing the heat of H2 adsorption on sorbents, which can be achieved by tuning pore structure, using unsaturated metal sites, chemical functionalization, or doping porous substrates with transition metal nanoparticles (to take advantage of hydrogen spillover).12,20,21 For chemical hydrogen storage, much of the research interests have been devoted to decreasing the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation enthalpies and activation energies, which often resort to catalysts and/or nanotechnologies.22–25 Furthermore, it is worth noting that the Kubas-type metal–dihydrogen interaction (σ–π H2 complexes) stands midway between physisorption and hydrides in binding strength.26 Recently, substantial development has been made in exploiting the applications of organometallic dihydrogen compounds for hydrogen storage.27–31 For example, chromium hydrazide gels display a remarkable excess reversible storage capacity of 3.23% (40.8 kg H2 per m3) at 298 K and 170 bar.31 Intriguingly, such kinds of metal–alkyl hydrazide gel could use pressure instead of temperature as a toggle, rendering them applicable to currently employed compressed gas tanks.
It is clear that only the lightweight hydrogen storage materials with intrinsically high gravimetric capacity can meet the ultimate DOE target. Accordingly, competent solid candidates are limited to hydrogen storage materials that mainly consist of light elements in the early rows of the periodic table of elements (Z ≤ 13), such as Li, B, C, N, Na, Mg and Al. Apart from physisorptive materials, the most extensively investigated lightweight materials refer to metal hydrides and complex hydrides (e.g. MgH2, NaAlH4, LiBH4, NH3BH3 and LiNH2).13,14,32–34 These materials, however, are generally plagued with issues of unfavorable thermodynamics, slow kinetics and/or poor reversibility, which hinder their practical application.
The ability to store hydrogen in solid materials depends critically upon the physiochemical properties including compositions, structures, sizes, textures, mass and heat transport, phase transition and grain boundaries, defects, vacancies, catalytic effects, surface interactions, and so on. Nanoscience and nanotechnologies have made great strides to understand reaction mechanisms at the molecular level and to control size, shape, porosity and surface functionality of solid state materials. In many cases, nanostructured and nanocomposite materials have shown significantly different thermodynamic and kinetic features from the bulk counterparts, making it possible to improve performances of hydrogen storage materials.22–25,35–36 Therefore, the combination of lightweight materials and nanostructures should offer great opportunities to achieve efficient hydrogen storage. In this article, we intend to provide an overview of recent advances in the field of chemical hydrogen storage that couples lightweight materials and nanostructures. We focus on Mg/MgH2-based systems, with selected experimental and computational examples to demonstrate the influences of size, microstructure, nanocomposite and nanoconfinement on the hydrogen storage properties such as capacity, thermodynamics and kinetics.
2. Magnesium-based nanostructures
2.1 Fundamentals and thermodynamics
Many metals and alloys can absorb hydrogen to form metal hydrides, where hydrogen is located in the form of atoms on the interstitial sites of the host metal lattice.1,37 Enhancing the mass capacities of metal hydrides is only reachable with lightweight metallic elements. In this view, Mg-based hydrides stand as a particularly interesting candidate because of its high gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen capacity (7.6 wt% and 0.111 kg L−1 for MgH2).38,39 Other prominent virtues of Mg include high abundance (abundant in both the earths crust and sea water), acceptable cost, non toxicity, and high safety.38–42 However, both the formation of MgH2 (tetragonal β phase) from bulk Mg and gaseous H2 and the reverse dehydrogenation of bulk MgH2 are extremely slow, with activation energies of 100 and 160 kJ mol−1, respectively.43 The uptake of H2 by Mg is a heterogeneous solid–gas reaction process involving multiple steps with different energy barriers. The sluggish kinetics has been mainly ascribed to a slow dissociation rate of molecular H2 on the Mg surface (a high energy of 432 kJ mol−1 H2 is needed to split molecules), low H2 diffusion coefficient (1.5 × 10−16 and 4 × 10−13 m2 s−1 in bulk MgH2 and Mg), and the formation of MgO surface layer, which is nearly H2-impermeable and retards hydriding and dehydriding reactions.40 In addition, bulk MgH2 is highly thermodynamically stable with decomposition enthalpy and entropy of 75 kJ mol−1 and 130 J K−1, respectively.41 A temperature of 300 °C is required to reach the thermodynamic equilibrium of Mg + H2 ↔ MgH2 at a plateau pressure of 1 bar.44 Thus, allowing the high storage capacity of the Mg/MgH2 system to be used under more moderate conditions necessitates extensive research efforts to address the unfavorable thermodynamic and kinetic barriers.
One of the most effective strategies to alter the thermodynamics of the Mg/MgH2 system is alloying Mg with other elements such as Ni, Cu, Al, Si, and Ge to form bimetallic alloys (e.g. Mg2Ni and Mg2Si).45–50 The resulted multicomponent alloys/hydrides decrease the hydrogen uptake/release temperature to some extent, but the hydrogen content is obviously reduced as well. The ternary hydride Mg2FeH6 contains 5.5 wt% hydrogen but it is likewise rather stable with a large dehydriding enthalpy.51 To compensate for the capacity penalty, an alternative approach is chemically destabilizing MgH2 with the addition of reactive components such as borohydrides, alanates and amides, which have high hydrogen density themselves.52–57 For example, combining MgH2 and LiBH4 through the reaction of 2LiBH4 + MgH2 ↔ 2LiH + MgB2 + 4H2 (ΔH = −46 kJ mol−1 H2), one can simultaneously lower the overall enthalpy and obtain a high theoretical gravimetric capacity of 10.5 wt%.56 Doping MgH2 with Al and Si as impurities (thus in minor quantity) also makes the Mg–H bond more susceptible to dissociation as a result of reduction in the band gaps of α-, β-, and γ-MgH2 phases.58 Furthermore, Mg/MgH2 treatment by alloying, doping and mixing with other components not only affect the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation thermodynamics but significantly improve the kinetic performance due to activation or catalysis effect.45–61
The above mentioned “alloying” and “mixing” approaches can be oversimplified as chemical modifications of Mg/MgH2. Physical routes such as mechanical milling also help to enhance hydrogen dissociation and recombination. High-energy ball milling has proved a successful way to significantly increase the hydrogen uptake/release rates, mainly due to the breaking of the outer oxide layer, the enlargement of surface, the introduction of defects, and the decrease of diffusion length.39,40,45,62,63 However, the thermodynamics are not evidently affected as compared to the kinetic improvements. This is possibly due to limited particle size (generally a few hundred nanometers and at the extreme, 20 nm) that can be achieved from ball milling.64 Both theoretical and experimental investigations have shown that the thermodynamic features of Mg/MgH2 may change with the crystalline size at the nanoscale, as shown below.
2.2 Theoretical modeling
In principle, the high density of grain boundaries and high surface areas presented in nanosized particles would provide an excess of enthalpy due to unsatisfied electronic bonds of surface atoms, and thus contribute to destabilize the metal/hydride system.35 If the particle is sufficiently small, most of the atoms will be exposed to the surface and thereby surface adsorption/desorption, rather than other steps such as subsurface penetration and diffusion in interstitial sites of the crystal lattice, should dominate the hydriding/dehydriding process. Different thermodynamic and kinetic features would be anticipated for nanoscaled Mg/MgH2. Indeed, theoretical calculations have predicted that hydrogen absorption/desorption energy decreases significantly when the crystal size of Mg/MgH2 falls below a few nanometers.64–68 For example, the results of Cheung et al. showed that for Mg nanoparticles with sizes of 0.6–2.0 nm, the heat of formation of MgH2 ranges from −16 to −19 kcal per Mg, lower than that of the bulk (−20 kcal per Mg).64 However, for Mg particles large than 2 nm (containing more than 100 atoms), the difference between the nanoparticles and the bulk is negligible. The results of ab initio study by Wagemans et al. also demonstrated that both Mg and MgH2 with decreasing cluster sizes are less stable than the bulk materials.65 The desorption enthalpy is 75 and 63 kJ mol−1 H2 for MgH2 bulk and Mg9H18 cluster (size of ∼0.9 nm), respectively. This destabilization results in a desorption temperature of approximately 200 °C. Density functional theories (DFT) study on thin films of Mg and MgH2 indicated a similar trend that the enthalpy decreases with reduction of film thickness in subnanometer and low nanometer regions.66 More recently, theoretical investigations based on both DFT and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations also reveal different phase stability, electronic structure and chemical bonding of the Mg/MgH2 nanosystem from the bulk.67–71
As an illustration here, Fig. 2 compares the thermodynamic properties and electronic structures among the single molecule, nanowire (diameter of 0.71 nm for Mg), and bulk of Mg/MgH2.70 The MgH2 nanowire exhibits a desorption enthalpy of 37.55 kJ mol−1 H2, which is approximately half of the bulk value. The corresponding desorption temperature at an equilibrium pressure of 1 atm is estimated to be 287 K, indicating the possibility of reversible hydrogen storage in Mg/MgH2 nanowires at ambient temperature. The obviously different thermodynamics among the single molecule, nanowire and bulk can be essentially associated with the dissimilar electronic structures among the three states. In the molecular form, a Mg atom exhibits non-metal characteristics. In bulk form, Mg is a typical metal and Mg–H interactions are represented by ionic bonds with a large band gap. The electronic structure of the nanowire lies just between the two extremes, that is, Mg nanowire shows discrete energy levels but with somewhat metallic characteristics while MgH2 nanowire displays semiconductor properties and thus possesses weaker stability than the bulk MgH2. The strength of Mg–H intercation can be further adjusted by the H-content and size effects.70 Theoretical studies on core-shell isomers of Mg clusters with trapped hydrogen molecules also predict that the system is weakly stable or metastable for different cluster sizes.71 Besides Mg–H destabilization, a hydrogen enriched state is thermodynamically possible for ultrathin nanowires, enabling an interesting gravimetric hydrogen density up to 8.8 wt%.72 Of course, such higher theoretical capacity requires further validation.

In addition to theoretical studies on basic thermodynamics, there are also quantum investigations on the effect of surface and interface properties of the Mg/MgH2 system.73,74 It is found that surface energy and stacking fault energies vary with crystal planes, which indicates that surface geometry may exert impact on hydrogen adsorption/desorption behaviours. Other effects of dopant and vacancy in magnesium hydrides have been evaluated theoretically as well.75,76 Notably, ab initio DFT calculations revealed that the computed activation barriers for H-vacancy diffusion from MgH2(110) surfaces into sublayers are less than 0.70 eV, much smaller than the energy barrier for hydrogen desorption on MgH2(110) surfaces (1.78–2.80 eV/H2).77 This result suggests that for MgH2, surface desorption is more likely than vacancy diffusion to be rate determining, and thus effective catalysts are of great importance to improve the dehydrogenation performance.
In this line, DFT calculations can provide a fundamental understanding of the role of catalysts in the dehydrogenation of MgH2 nanoclusters. Larsson et al. have shown that the transition metal Ti, V, Fe, and Ni atoms not only lower desorption energies (as shown in Fig. 3) but also continue to attract at least four hydrogen atoms from the rest of the cluster as hydrogen desorbs.78 Furthermore, the transition metal atoms diffuse upon dehydrogenation, suggesting that they stay in the MgH2/Mg interface region to continuously catalyze the dehydrogenation. Thus, a small amount of catalyst may be sufficient to improve the kinetics of MgH2. Theoretical studies on the thermodynamics of Mg-based alloys has been reported as well.79 First principles DFT calculations showed that adding Al or Si makes the Mg–Ti alloys more stable and their hydrides less stable. Also, recent high accuracy fixed node diffusion quatum Monte Carlo calculations indicated that the hydrogen desorption energy of MgH2 decreases with cluster size while hydrides of Al and Al/Mg alloyed nanoparticles are stabilized by nanoscale effects.80 Thus, the thermodynamics of Mg/Al alloys are tunable between the strongly bound MgH2 and weakly bound AlH3 at the nanoscale. According to these results, it is theoretically feasible to adjust the hydrogenation energy and performance of Mg-based hydrogen storage materials over a wide range by controlling the chemistry and structure of Mg alloys, as has already been demonstrated in the example of ternary MgTiX (X = Al or Si) alloys.81

It should be noted that all the above mentioned calculations have been generally performed in vacuum. The results may change under specific chemical environments and more parameters such as pressure should be taken into consideration to better reflect the realistic hydrogen storage properties. In addition, few theoretical calculations or simulations focus on the size effect on other important thermodynamic parameters such as hydrogen solubility and diffusivity, isothermal profile, and plateau pressure for Mg/MgH2 nanostructures. Furthermore, most of the theoretical studies on size effects mainly rely upon assumed surfaces without emphasis on steps, kinks, edges, corners and defects, which are normally involved in nanomaterials. Regardless of these limitations, the insights afforded by calculations and simulations have stimulated intensive, continuing research efforts in the preparation and application of nanoscaled Mg/MgH2, which often exhibits superior hydrogen storage performance (kinetics in particular) than that gained by chemical modification of the bulk materials alone.
2.3 Mg-based nanomaterials
Shifting from the Mg-based bulk form to Mg-based nanomaterials, we outline herein three usually adopted forms, that is, nanowires or nanoparticles, nanoalloys and nanocomposites, and particles or layers confined in nanostructured substrates (Fig. 4). For Mg nanowires, those with diameters ranging from ∼30 to 170 nm were prepared using physical vapour deposition and their size-dependent H2 absorption/desorption properties were investigated.82 The wire with the smallest diameter absorbed ∼7.6 wt% and desorbed ∼6.8 wt% hydrogen within 30 min at 573 K, while the wire with the largest diameter adsorbed ∼6.5 wt% and desorbed ∼5.0 wt% hydrogen. Particularly, the hydriding and dehydriding activation energies of 30 nm nanowires were only ∼34 and 39 kJ mol−1 H2 respectively, significantly lower than the values of the bulk. The enhanced kinetics and thermodynamics of Mg nanowires showed their potential as hydrogen storage media. More recently, Akiyama and co-workers reported the growth mechanism of MgH2/Mg nanofibers through chemical vapour deposition and the in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation of the decomposition of MgH2 nanofibers.83,84 The growth mechanism revealed that the nano/microstructure of Mg/MgH2 is controllable by adjusting suitable experimental parameters such as vaporation/deposition temperature and H2 pressure, which determine the rates of Mg condensation and hydrogenation.83 The TEM results indicate the orientation relationship between MgH2 and Mg during the phase transformation.84 Further work still remains to associate this structural information with the hydriding and dehydriding properties of nanofibrous Mg and MgH2.

In comparison with one-dimensional Mg nanostructures, Mg nanoparticles have received much more attention. Due to high reactivity, it is a challenge to obtain Mg nanoparticles with high phase purity, uniform size and good dispersion. Nevertheless, substantial progress has been made in the development of novel synthetic methods, which include pulsed laser deposition (PLD), mechanochemical milling, sonoelectrochemistry, surfactant-assisted electrolysis, solvated metal atom dispersion, and solution reduction.85–91 These approaches can generate Mg/MgH2 products with particle sizes ranging from several nanometers to submicrometers and allow for the appraisement of nanosize effects on hydrogen storage properties. Some of the selected results are highlighted here.
For Mg nanoparticles (size of ∼50 nm) prepared by PLD, the enthalpy of MgH2 was found to be −68 kJ mol−1 H2.85 This reduced enthalpy relative to the bulk value was explained by excess volume. Thermodynamics of MgH2 nanoparticles synthesized from a mechanochemical method displays similar measurable trend of size-dependent reduction of reaction enthalpy.86 The decrease of decomposition reaction enthalpy and entropy of the nano MgH2 (with particle size down to ∼7 nm) from that of the bulk was 2.84 kJ mol−1 H2 and 3.8 J mol−1 H2 K−1, respectively. As the coupled decrease of entropy partially counteracts the effect from the enthalpy change, the drop in the desorption temperature (∼6 °C) is less than theoretical prediction. However, remarkably lower hydrogen absorption and desorption temperatures were observed in colloidal Mg nanoparticles and the resulting hydrides.88,89 Surfactant-stabilized colloidal Mg nanoparticles of 5 nm can reversibly store 7.6 wt% hydrogen near room temperature (totally 1.34 wt% by taking into account the amount of surfactant) and the corresponding colloidal MgH2 fully releases hydrogen at 85 °C, which approaches the operational temperature of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells.88 Similarly, monodispersive colloidal Mg-hexadecylamine nanoparticles (∼2.8 nm) can be fully hydrided at 33 bar and 118 °C and the formed hydride can desorb H2 at an initial temperature of 115 °C.89 While the low desorption onset temperature mentioned here for nanoparticles is highly appealing, the majority of hydrogen release is still involved in the temperature region higher than 350 °C.
In comparison with the effect on thermodynamics, the size of Mg nanoparticles exerts a more profound impact on kinetics. As shown in Fig. 5, Mg nanoparticles with size of 25, 32, and 38 nm show much different hydrogen adsorption and desorption kinetics, revealing a trend of decreasing rates from large to small.90 For example, the 25 nm particles adsorb 95% of the maximum hydrogen capacity within 60 s at 300 °C, which corresponds to a 7 times higher rate than that for 38 nm particles. Such a large rate difference is beyond the expected inverse dependence on particle size, and thus may be attributed not only to enlarging surface area and decreasing diffusion distance but also to increasing density of defect sites. Despite the remarkable reaction rates, these nanoparticles still require relatively high temperatures for hydrogen adsorption and desorption; specifically, the dehydriding temperature is above 300 °C. Thus, experimental investigations up to date lead us to believe that for the Mg/MgH2 system within the size range of a few nanometers to ∼100 nm, there is essentially similar thermodynamic behaviour to the bulk although a slight improvement has been shown in many cases. Further particle downsizing to the subnanometer may result in dramatic effect but this remains to be seen. Recently, Mg hydride clusters have been obtained by using organometallic chemistry approaches.91,92 Bearing in mind the power of the molecular concept, Mg hydride complexes would provide the possibility to tune the features of the Mg–H bond and thereby the thermodynamical dehydrogenation characteristics.

It should be noted that there is usually discrepancy between theoretically calculated and experimentally determined results. This arises possibly due to inaccuracies in the theoretical model and/or the presence of polydispersity in particle size. On the other hand, it is not easy to achieve precise control over the size of Mg nanoparticles, making it difficult to accurately evaluate the size-dependence hydrogen storage properties. Concerning the disadvantages of nanoscaling Mg/MgH2, nanoparticles (in particular ultrasmall clusters) tend to aggregate rapidly to form larger and more stable particles through crystal ripening at elevated temperatures. It is expected that a low amounts of additive, which act as grain-growth inhibitors, will be beneficial. Surface functionalization is also helpful, but the stabilizing layer may retard hydrogen diffusion and thus needs to be removed, which in turn often causes sintering, particle agglomeration and consequent degradation of hydrogen storage capacity. Furthermore, the reactive Mg nanoparticles generally lack long term stability. To address these issues, two notable strategies have been developed for Mg-based nanomaterials, including the use of nanocomposites and the confinement of Mg/MgH2 in nanoporous substrates or scaffolds.93–110
Nanostructured alloys (in many cases solid solution or intermetallic compounds) and nanocomposites can integrate different components to gain multiple functionality. The above mentioned theoretical studies show that transition metals such as Ti, V, Fe, Ni and Al can enhance the dehydrogenation properties of MgH2 (Fig. 3).78,80 The catalytic effects of these transition metals have been confirmed in a number of experimental investigations. Recent examples include V decorated Mg nanoblade array,93 Mg–V nanoparticles,94 Mg–AlTi multilayer nanocomposites,95 MgH2–TiH2 nanocomposites,96 and so on. Remarkably, the sputtered Mg–AlTi multilayers, in which nanometric Mg or Mg–Al–Ti layers are constrained by 2 nm thick AlTi layers, attain a hydrogen capacity of 5.1 wt% without significant degradation over 200 cycles at 473 K.95 Rapid sorption kinetics and microstructure stability can be maintained over 250 cycles. Integration of nonmetallic components such as carbon nanostructures and metal oxides (e.g. TiO2 and Nb2O5) in Mg-based nanocomposites has also proven effective.97–100 Milling Mg or MgH2 with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is particularly useful to achieve fast hydrogen adsorption/desorption kinetics and favourable cyclability. The doped CNTs may act as catalysts to facilitate hydrogen dissociation and diffusion.97 Also, the addition of CNTs increases the milling efficiency to produce finer and uniform small grains and prevents particle agglomeration and sintering during hydriding/dehydriding process.98 Not surprisingly, coupled addition of metal nanoparticles and CNTs can afford synergetic effects.99
Recently, Jeon et al. have developed an air-stable composite material that consists of metallic Mg nanocystals in a gas-selective polymer, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), as shown in Fig. 6.101 The use of PMMA matrix affords the respectable merits of (1) serving as both the surface capping agent and stabilizing ligand, (2) being highly permeable to H2 but resistive to O2 and H2O, and (3) being mechanically flexible to withstand the volume expansion during phase transition between Mg and MgH2. Impressively, the Mg/PMMA nanocomposites show stability after two weeks of air exposure. The novel nanocomposites enable hydrogen storage with both high density (gravimetrically up to 6 wt% of Mg alone, 4 wt% of the total composite, and volumetrically 55 g L−1) and rapid kinetics (uptake <30 min at 200 °C) without using heavy-metal catalysts (Fig. 7). The remarkable uptake capacity and kinetics can be sustained for a few adsorption and desorption cycles, with only slightly decrease of dehydriding rate. This interesting polymer-based nanocomposite material doubtlessly deserves further attention, such as investigating the optimization of Mg loading and the polymer/metal nanocrystal interfacial properties.

While the polymer is normally inactive for chemical hydrogen storage, its presence in the composite will compromise the system capacity. In this regard, nanocomposites with another hydride may be helpful. Indeed, a recent study has shown that MgH2–TiH2 nanocomposites exhibit 20 times faster kinetics than that for a pure nanometric MgH2 powder.96 The TiH2 phase in the composite minimizes grain coarsening of MgH2, allows nucleation of MgH2 phase over the whole Mg crystallites before the formation of a blocking hydride continuous layer, and acts as a gateway for hydrogen dissociation and diffusion. Another example of a nanocomposite is the MgH2–VTi–carbon nanotube system, which exhibits a very large capacity and ultrafast hydrogenation kinetics due to coupled catalytic effects of V and Ti with carbon nanotubes.102 While these nanocomposites possess significantly lower kinetic barriers relative to the bulk, their thermodynamic stability is almost unmodified.
Introducing Mg/MgH2 into a porous scaffold material is another efficient route to prohibit agglomeration and grain growth of nanoparticles, which will consequently gain stability over hydrogen uptake and release cycles. In such a nanoconfinement systems, suitable scaffold materials should be lightweight, chemically inert, mechanically flexible to withstand repeated volume change, and thermally conductive to ensure fast heat transportation. Carbonaceous materials are the most promising because carbon is a lightweight, stable, and a widespread available element.103 In addition, porous carbons represent one family of the most prevailing porous materials. As a result, it is not strange that nanoconfinement systems are almost exclusively based on carbon substrates, typically microporous carbons and mesoporous carbon aerogels.103–109
Several approaches have been adopted to confine Mg/MgH2 into the porous scaffold, such as melt infiltration and solvent mediated impregnation and synthesis.24 For example, infiltration of nanoporous carbon with molten metallic Mg results in non-oxidized nanosized crystallites (size of 2–5 nm) with loadings up to 15 wt%.104 Melting methods can be also used to prepare MgH2-incorporated mesoporous carbon aerogels.106 It was found that depositing a wetting layer of Ni or Cu on the aerogel surface increased the amount of hydride infiltration. An alternative strategy to embed nano-sized MgH2 in nanoporous carbon involves two steps of first filling the scaffold with a solution of dibutylmagnesium (MgBu2) precursor and then hydrogenating the impregnated MgBu2.105,107–109 Similarly, preparation of MgH2, Mg–Ni–H and Mg–Fe–H nanoparticles inserted in ordered mesoporous carbon templates can be attained by the decomposition of related organometallic precursors.110 For this synthesis, much caution should be paid on the extremely reactive MgBu2 that may self-ignite in contact with air and moisture.
The confined Mg/MgH2 in nanoporous scaffolds shows different thermodynamic and kinetic hydrogen storage behaviours in comparison with the unconfined particles. For example, MgH2 incorporated in carbon aerogel had >5 times faster dehydrogenation kinetics than ball-milled activated MgH2; decorating the carbon aerogel with Ni or Cu further increased the rate of hydrogen release.106,107 It has been demonstrated that the pore size distribution of the scaffold materials influences the dehydrogenation kinetics of the confined hydrides, that is, smaller pores mediate faster hydrogen desorption rates.105 Logically, the improvement in kinetics may be attributed to the reduction of particle size in the scaffold. Notably, thermodynamic properties of MgH2 can be also altered in a nanoconfinement system. Using microporous carbons as the host, the filled MgH2 nanoparticles with size smaller than 3 nm gave a dehydrogenation enthalpy of ∼64 kJ mol−1 and entropy of ∼117 kJ mol−1, which are much lower than the bulk material (Fig. 8).108 Such a significant destabilization was ascribed to the small particle size and the interaction effect between particle and support. While the size effect alone has been investigated intensively, the interaction effect (if it really exists) has attracted little research attention.

The major issues facing the nanoconfined system include the generally uncontrollable pore filling and low degree of Mg/MgH2 loading in the scaffold. A considerable proportion of Mg/MgH2 may locate outside rather than inside the pores and lead to larger particle size.109 To the best of our knowledge, the highest MgH2 loading ever reported does not exceed 30 wt%. The extra weight of the host materials limits the system hydrogen capacities. Therefore, to take advantage of the nanoconfinement effect, innovative strategies should be developed to improve the infiltration efficiency of Mg/MgH2.
3. Conclusions and perspectives
The realization of a hydrogen economy will rely on efficient and reliable hydrogen storage media. The challenging DOE targets necessitate development of solid hydrogen storage materials with intrinsically high capacity, fast kinetics and good reversibility. Magnesium-based materials represent a very promising candidate because Mg features prominent virtues such as large gravimetric and volumetric capacity, high abundance, low cost, and environmental friendliness. The issues facing Mg-based materials mainly include high hydriding/dehydriding temperatures and poor kinetics. Nanoscience and nanotechnologies have provided innovative opportunities to address these issues. Both theoretical calculations and experimental investigations have shown that shifting from bulk to nanostructures can considerably improve the thermodynamic and kinetic properties. Most computational studies predict notable reduction of reaction enthalpy (thus lower hydrogenation and dehydrogenation temperatures) as particle size falls into the region of low nanometres. Hydrogen storage in Mg near the operational temperatures of fuel cells is theoretically possible for extremely small nanoclusters. Most experimental results confirm a similar trend of size-dependent effects, but the effect is generally more prominent in terms of kinetics rather than thermodynamics. Extensive efforts have been dedicated to taking advantage of nano-size effects. Strategies include the use of colloidal nanoparticles, nanowires, nanoalloys, nanocomposites and nanoconfined systems.
Despite substantial advancement, a series of scientific and technological issues remain to be solved before the practical utilization of nanostructured Mg/MgH2. First, in-depth understanding the fundamental mechanism of hydrogen storage is still required. Previous theoretical studies have been generally performed in vacuum and mainly focused on thermodynamic aspects like enthalpy and entropy. More realistic conditions and parameters (such as hydrogen pressure, hydrogen solubility/diffusivity, isotherms, plateaus, etc.) should be taken into account. Meanwhile, in situ experimental observation (especially the structural evolution) of hydrogen absorption/desorption would provide valuable information. Very recently, in situ neutron diffraction analysis and combination of neutron reflectrometry, X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy have shed much insight in uncovering the performance and mechanism of catalyzed Mg-based nanomaterials.111,112 Since hydrogen uptake/release in/from the Mg/MgH2 system may involve complex processes of surface interactions, atomic or molecular migration/diffusion, catalytic reactions and phase transformations, multidisciplinary research is necessary to fully elucidate the reaction mechanism. Second, it is difficult to prepare Mg-based nanostructures with high phase purity and well controlled shape and size, due to high reactivity of Mg. Although some particularly designed synthetic approaches (e.g. vapor transport deposition and electrochemical reduction) have been applied to obtain shaped or small-sized nanocrystals, they are not easily extended to scalable preparation. It is thus necessary to develop new synthetic methods (possibly combining chemical and physical routes) for mass production of controllable Mg-based nanostructures. Third, it should be noted that the theoretical hydrogen capacity of MgH2 (7.6 wt%) is very close to the value of ultimate DOE target (7.5 wt%, Table 1), leaving little room to include additional weight of other components in a practical hydrogen storage system. Integrating Mg-based nanostructures with another hydrogen storage material that has higher intrinsic capacity (e.g. lightweight complex hydrides113) may be a promising option.
