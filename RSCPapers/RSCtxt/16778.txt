    , Accepted 12th October 2020First published on 12th October 2020AbstractEfficiency of solar cells can be improved by introducing intermediate bands. However, width and occupation requirements on the intermediate bands bring challenges for materials design. In this study, we systematically investigate the electronic structure of doped CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, or I). A screening in transition metals suggests that Cr and Mo doped perovskites have dispersive and half-filled intermediate bands, which is desirable for building solar cells. However, intermediate bands originated from degenerated d orbitals are easily split when the octahedral symmetry of the local chemical environment around the dopant is broken. To avoid this problem, we further perform a screening of non-transition metals aiming to generate sp orbital-based intermediate bands. It turns out that In and Ga can generate a half-filled intermediate band, which is not sensitive to the local symmetry. The estimated efficiency of In and Ga doped CsPbCl3 at a doping concentration of 8.3% is 57.97% and 54.21%, notably higher than the Shockley–Queisser limit (40.7%). Results presented here demonstrate the potential of intermediate band engineering in photovoltaic applications.
Introduction
In the past decade, perovskite solar cells have attracted intense research interest. The power conversion efficiency of perovskites increases from 3.8% in 20091 to 25.2% in 2019.2 Although the progress is encouraging, there is a Shockley–Queisser (SQ) efficiency limit for all single-gap solar cells.3,4 To go beyond the SQ limit, one way is connecting two single-gap solar cells together to form a tandem solar cell.5 However, tandem solar cells are usually difficult to be fabricated because of lattice mismatch.5 Another way to go beyond the SQ limit is introducing an intermediate band (IB) in the gap.6 With an IB, low energy photons can excite electrons from valence bands to the IB and then to conduction bands, which improves the efficiency of solar energy utilization. At the same time, electrons and holes are extracted from the conduction and valence bands and no carriers are extracted from the IB, so the voltage can be maintained compared to the corresponding single-gap solar cell.
Since the concept of IB solar cell was proposed, a lot of attempts have been made to improve solar cell efficiency via IB. It is found that IB can be introduced by using discretized levels of quantum dots or by incorporating impurities, such as metal elements with partially filled d orbitals, into bulk host semiconductors. Intermediate bands have been found in III–V,7–11 II–VI,12 silicon,13,14 spinel15 and chalcopyrite16–21 through transition metal doping. Non-transition metal doping induced intermediate bands, such as in Sn or Ge doped chalcopyrite,22–28 have also been reported.
In the field of perovskites, IBs can be found in pristine double perovskite29,30 or 0 dimensional perovskite31 structures. However, the IBs in these structures are empty bands, which is not desirable in photovoltaic applications. In fact, it is suggested that the maximum efficiency is reached when the IB is half-filled.32 In addition, the IB should have a notable dispersion to avoid non-radiative recombination33 and at the same time with a limited width to avoid intra-band excitation.34 Doping induced IBs have also been predicted in perovskites, such as Co doped CH3NH3PbI335 and Mn doped CsPbI2Br.36 Unfortunately, the IBs in these systems are empty and flat. Wider IBs have been reported in some non-transition metal doped perovskites,37–39 but they are still empty bands. It is thus interesting to see if it is possible to generate half-filled and dispersive IBs in perovskites via defect engineering.
Although organic–inorganic perovskites are promising for single-gap solar cells, inorganic perovskites is a better starting point for IB solar cells, since they are more stable40 and they have larger band gaps (1.7–3.0 eV41–43) which makes the formation of a dispersive IB easier. In this study, using cubic CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) as an example, we perform a computational screening of transition metal and non-transition metal doping to search for half-filled IBs with a suitable dispersion, aiming to reveal how the electron configuration of the doped elements determines the IB occupation and distinguish the difference between transition metal and non-transition metal doping.
For transition metal doping, we first consider the transition metals in the fourth period which can substitute Pb2+ in perovskites. Electronic structure calculations show that Cr doped CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) have a half-filled and dispersive IB. Therefore, we further study the doping of Mo in the same group, which gives a similar electronic structure. The IB width can be tuned by changing the doping concentration. Partial density of states (PDOS) analysis indicates that the half-filled IB in Cr and Mo doped CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) mainly comes from the degenerated d orbitals. Half occupancy of the IB is thus sensitive to the symmetry of the local chemical environment. Therefore, we further consider doping of non-transition metal which has an s1 electron configuration at the +2 valence state. It turns out that In and Ga doping lead to stable half-filled IB which is not sensitive to the local chemical environment. This finding provides us new insights in understanding effects of local symmetry around the dopants, which can be used as general guidance in intermediate band solar cell design.
Computational details
All calculations were performed using the density functional theory (DFT) implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).44 The projector-augmented wave (PAW) method was used to describe the core electrons.45 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) parameterized by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE)46 was adopted for exchange and correlation energy in doping element screening. PBE + U47 was used for some systems to obtain more accurate electronic structures, where test calculations indicated that the results are not very sensitive to the parameter U. For systems finally selected from doping element screening, Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE)48 hybrid functional was used for electronic structure calculation with the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effect also considered. Geometry relaxation was performed until the total energy change was within 10−5 eV and the force on each atom was smaller than 0.01 eV Å−1. The plane-wave cutoff energy was set to 500 eV in PBE calculation. A 6 × 6 × 6 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh49 was used for calculations using a unit cell. A 4 × 4 × 4, 3 × 3 × 3, 4 × 4 × 3 or 4 × 3 × 2 mesh was used for calculations using a 2 × 2 × 2, 3 × 3 × 3, 2 × 2 × 3 or 2 × 3 × 4 supercell, respectively. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were carried out using a 3 × 3 × 3 supercell at 300 K.
Results and discussion
We first calculate the geometric and electronic properties of pristine CsPbX3 with the PBE functional. The calculated lattice constant is 5.72, 5.99, and 6.38 Å, for X = Cl, Br, and I, respectively, agreeing well with previous theoretical50,51 and experimental52,53 results. The bandgaps are predicted to be 2.18, 1.76, and 1.46 eV, close to those obtained in other calculations50,51 and as expected narrower than the experimental results (3.05, 2.36, and 1.73 eV41–43). As also predicted previously,50,51 the valence band (VB) edge is mainly contributed by X-p and Pb-s orbitals and the conduction band (CB) edge is mainly contributed by Pb-p orbitals.
To check the possibility of doping metal atoms into ABX3 perovskites, two empirical parameters, the tolerance factor (t) and octahedral factor (μ),54,55 can be evaluated. They are defined as    where rA, rB and rX are the ionic radius of A+, B2+, and X−, respectively. A cubic perovskite is empirically considered to be stable when t ranges from 0.813 to 1.107 and μ ranges from 0.442 to 0.895.55 Here, we use the weighted mean radius56 of M (M is the doped element) and Pb in doped perovskite CsMxPb1 − xX3 as the radius rB.rB = x × rM + (1 − x) × rPb
Since previous experimental studies show that the doping concentration in similar systems can be higher than 10%,57–59 we use a 2 × 2 × 2 supercell which leads to a doping concentration of 12.5% in our initial calculations. As shown in Fig. 1, the calculated tolerance factor and octahedral factor satisfy the empirical stability criterion for all CsMxPb1 − xX3 systems. Stabilities are also confirmed by AIMD simulations for In and Ga doped CsPbCl3. As shown in Fig. S15 (ESI†), structure of the simulated system is well maintained in 10 ps long trajectories.

For all transition metal elements in the fourth period, only Ti, Cr, Fe doped CsPbX3 have well-separated IB (Fig. S1, ESI†). However, the IBs of Ti and Fe doped CsPbX3 are very flat with a width of 0.02 and 0.01 eV, which is a sign of strong non-radiative recombination33 and thus not suitable for solar cell applications. As a result, Cr doped CsPbX3 become the only candidate for IB solar cell materials. Band structure of Cr doped CsPbCl3 is shown in Fig. 2a, where IB is well separated from the VB and CB and it is also dispersive with a width of 0.52 eV. It is suggested that when the width of the IB is less than or roughly equal to 0.825 eV, the solar cell efficiency retains over 90% of its optimum value.34 According to this criterion, the IB of Cr doped CsPbCl3 has an acceptable dispersion.

Red solid lines and blue dotted lines in the band structures represent spin-up and spin-down bands. Blue circle lines represent eg or t2g states of Cr. The Fermi level is set to 0. 
Partial density of states (PDOS) analysis suggests that contributions to VB and CB edges of Cr doped CsPbCl3 is almost the same as in the pristine CsPbCl3 case. The IB mainly comes from the Cr-d orbitals. With an octahedral symmetry, Cr-d orbitals will be split into a doubly degenerated eg state and a triply degenerated t2g state. The eg state is higher in energy compared to the t2g state. At the same time, there is an even larger spin splitting for these d orbitals. Putting them together, a schematic of Cr-d orbital energies can be obtained (Fig. 3).
 Fig. 3  Schematic of Cr-d orbital energies and the corresponding electron configuration. 
An electronic structure analysis can help us to see what is the requirement on the number of d electrons in the transition metal to obtain a half-filled IB in the doped CsPbX3 systems. First, we note that only the eg bands which point to neighboring substitutional sites are dispersive while the t2g bands are almost flat (Fig. 2a). Therefore, we want a partially occupied eg state. Then, we need to check if the spin splitting is larger than the eg–t2g splitting. If this is true, d4 or d9 electron configuration gives a half-filled eg band. Otherwise, d7 or d9 electron configuration is required. Here, only early and later transition metal (Sc, Ti, and Cu) doped systems have a small spin splitting (Fig. S5, ESI†). In other cases (V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni doping), the spin splitting is lager. Therefore, the only two cases which will possibly give a half-filled eg band is Cr and Cu doping, since Cr2+ has a d4 electron configuration and Cu2+ has a d9 configuration. The final requirement to obtain a half filled eg band is that this band should be in the band gap of the host material. From Sc to Cu doping, the d bands are shifted from higher to lower energies (Fig. S5, ESI†). Cu-d bands are already in the VB manifest of host material. Therefore, Cr is the only one we find in the screening which can give a half-filled IB in the doped CsPbX3. PBE + U calculation for Cr doped CsPbCl3 gives a band structure (Fig. 2c) similar to the PBE result. Notice that the results are not very sensitive to the value of parameter U (Fig. S2, ESI†). Based on the analysis above, we expect that Mo doped CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) may also have a dispersive and half-filled IB since Mo and Cr have the same d-electron configuration. Radius of Mo2+ is 0.92 Å, which makes the tolerance and octahedral factor criteria still be satisfied. PBE + U calculations confirm that Mo doped CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) has a partially filled dispersive IB (Fig. S6, ESI†). Although W is also in the same group, the impurity bands of W doped CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) overlap with CB (Fig. S7, ESI†).
IB width is an important parameter for solar cell efficiency, which can be tuned by the concentration of doped atoms.11 As a demonstration, 3 × 3 × 3 CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) supercells are used to build doped system with a smaller doping concentration of 3.7%. Band structure and PDOS of Cr doped CsPbCl3 (Fig. S8, ESI†) gives an IB width of 0.17 eV, which is as expected much smaller than that at the doping concentration of 12.5%. Such a smaller width can inhibit inter-band transitions34 while maintaining a certain dispersion.33
The IB of Cr or Mo doped CsPbCl3 comes from the doubly degenerated spin-up eg state. Notice that the eg degeneracy depends on the local octahedral symmetry. If such a symmetry is broken, the doubly degenerated state may be split into one fully occupied and one empty states, which is not desirable for solar cell applications. To demonstrate this, we replace one Pb with Cr in a 2 × 2 × 3 CsPbCl3 supercell. Now Cr is surrounded by six non-equivalent atoms. As shown in Fig. 2d, IB is split into two bands: one band is above the Fermi level and the other is under the Fermi level and no half-filled IB exists any more.
To solve this problem, we consider using s instead of d orbitals to construct IB. Group III elements Ga, In, and Tl are dopant candidates since they have s1 electron configuration at the 2+ valence state. Tolerance factor and octahedral factor analysis support the possibility of doping these elements into CsPbX3 (Fig. 1). Electronic structure calculations indicate that impurity bands in In and Ga doped CsPbCl3 have a half-filled IB in the gap (Fig. 4). As expected, the IB mainly comes from In-s or Ga-s orbital (Fig. S9, ESI†). However, in contrast to the Cr doping case, there is a strong hybridization between dopant-s and Cl-p orbitals. As a result, the IB width is larger than 1 eV, which is larger than the optimal value for IB solar cells.34 A test calculation at a lower doping concentration, which is experimentally more feasible, confirms that the IB width can be significantly decreased by tuning the doping concentration (Fig. S10, ESI†).

To describe the electronic structure of these two non-transition metal doped CsPbCl3 more accurately, we calculated their band structure using the HSE hybrid functional and also with the SOC effect considered. In HSE + SOC band structures, the IB is upshifted to the CB compared the PBE results and there is a small split due to the SOC effect (Fig. S11, ESI†). For In doped CsPbCl3, the IB already overlap with the CB (Fig. S11, ESI†). Notice that a high doping concentration is adopted here. In real applications, a much smaller doping concentration and thus a narrower IB is expected. Then, the overlap between IB and CB is expected to be avoided. For Ga doped CsPbCl3, the IB is separated from both VB and CB (Fig. 5a). In both systems, IB is closer to CB compared to VB. Notice that, it is not necessary to obtain an IB exactly at the middle of the gap, which undesirably gives a maximum Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) non-radiative recombination.60

HSE + SOC calculations are performed for Ga and In doped CsPbCl3 at the doping concentration of 8.3% using a 2 × 2 × 3 supercell, which gives a different local chemical environment to the dopant comparing to the high-symmetry 2 × 2 × 2 supercell.
As expected, the partially occupied IB bands are not sensitive to the local symmetry (Fig. S12, ESI†). The IB of Ga doped CsPbCl3 is well maintained (Fig. 5b) except that the bandwidth is narrowed compared to the 2 × 2 × 2 supercell case. As expected, at such an experimental more feasible61 doping concentration, the IB in In doped CsPbCl3 is also separated from the CB due to the bandwidth shrink. Robustness of the partially occupied IB in different supercell models indicates that it is not a result of the artificial periodic boundary condition imposed by a specific supercell model.
In IB solar cells, carriers are extracted from VBM and CBM. Therefore, the effective masses of electrons and holes at CBM and VBM are import parameters for IB solar cells. As listed in Table 1, In and Ga doping does not really change the electron and hole effective masses of CsPbCl3. The effective masses of the doped system are only slightly smaller than those in pristine CsPbCl3. A small effective mass is desirable to achieve a high mobility in solar cell. Based on a detailed balance analysis,6 the limit efficiency of Ga and In doped CsPbCl3 at the doping concentration of 8.3% is 54.21% and 57.97%, which is notably higher than the SQ limit (40.7%)6 at the same condition.

Another important issue is the charge status of the dopant. Test calculations indicate that an energy shift of the IB can be induced by changing the number of electrons (Fig. S14, ESI†). To determine the most possible charge status, we calculate the formation energy of In and Ga doped CsPbCl3 at the doping concentration of 12.5%, which is defined as62  where  is the total energy of the CsPbCl3 supercell doped with M (M = In, Ga) in a charge state q, while Etot[CsPbCl3] is the total energy of the pristine CsPbCl3 supercell. Chemical potentials μM and μPb are calculated using bulk metal materials as the reference. εF is the difference between the Fermi level and the valence band maximum (VBM) of pristine CsPbCl3. ΔV is the correction energy to correct the finite-size potential energy for charged supercell.63 Formation energy  as a function of εF for the charge states q = −1, 0, 1 is shown in Fig. 6. In most cases, neutral dopant state is thermodynamically stable.

Conclusions
In summary, we have investigated the electronic structure of transition metal and non-transition metal doped CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I). We find that Cr, Mo, Ga, In doped CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) have a dispersive and half-filled IB due to the d4 electron configuration of Cr2+ and Mo2+ and the s1 electron configuration of Ga2+ and In2+. Decreasing of the doping concentration can decrease the width of IB. The half occupation of IB for transition metal (Cr, Mo) doped CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) is sensitive to the symmetry around the dopant, which make practical applications challenging. In contrast, in non-transition metal Ga and In doped systems, the half-filled IB is very robust. Efficiency of Ga and In doped CsPbCl3 with the robust half-filled IB is predicted to be as high as 54.21% and 57.97% at a doping concentration of 8.3%, which is much larger than the SQ limit (40.7%) and promising for photovoltaic applications.
