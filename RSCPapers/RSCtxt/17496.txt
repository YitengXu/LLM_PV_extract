    , Accepted 6th December 2020First published on 8th December 2020AbstractSolar cells with organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites have attracted great attention in the last decade. Herein, we propose lead-free halide perovskite (CH2)2NH2SnI3, as well as alloys (CH2)2NH2SnI3−xBrx, to avoid the toxicology of lead element. We find that the perovskite (CH2)2NH2SnI3 has much better stability than CH3NH3PbI3 and possesses a band gap of 1.06 eV. Meanwhile, the alloy (CH2)2NH2SnI2Br has an ideal band gap of 1.31 eV for photovoltaics. The alloy (CH2)2NH2SnI3−xBrx is proved to have higher optical absorption than CH3NH3PbI3 in general. We thus propose that the lead-free perovskite (CH2)2NH2SnI3 and alloys (CH2)2NH2SnI3−xBrx are probably excellent candidates for stable and high-performance photovoltaic absorber materials.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are a promising photovoltaic (PV) technology, as lead (Pb)-based hybrid perovskite solar cells (HPSCs) have achieved impressive power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 25.2% since the first report in 2009.1,2 However, the long-term instability and toxicity of lead in the PSCs still need to be addressed for further commercialization applications of them. Partial or full substitution of the organic cations, efficient encapsulation and interfacial functionalization are powerful ways to improve the stability of the hybrid perovskites.3–6
Moreover, one of the most feasible strategies to address the toxic issue is to replace Pb with tin (Sn), which is also from Group IV. Considering its electron configuration of ns2np2 and coordination geometry akin to Pb, the Sn-based perovskite should possess largely inherent semiconducting properties of the pristine Pb-based counterpart.7,8 In addition, the Sn-based perovskite family has also been reported to possess lower band gaps than those of the pristine Pb-based family,9 which not only can broaden the applications of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites in tandem solar cells for further enhancing PCEs10,11 but can also facilitate the development of photosensors/photoconductors operating in the infrared region.12 However, few systematic biological studies have shown that Sn may pose more danger to the environment and may not be a cost-effective alternative.13,14 Nevertheless, the latest studies have demonstrated that tin perovskites are significantly less bioavailable than lead-based perovskites.15,16 Thus, to some extent, tin may be a safer alternative to replace lead for lead-based halide perovskites.
However, the development of efficient pure Sn-based PSCs is hindered by the chemical instability of the Sn2+ element. Sn, with a weakened inert pair effect compared to the heavier Pb in Group IV, has strong propensity to be oxidized to Sn4+. Consequently, the pure Sn-based perovskites will lose suitable semiconducting properties for photovoltaic applications, leading to poor device reliability and reproducibility.7,17 To mitigate this troublesome Sn oxidation, one prevailing method adopted recently is to constitute Pb–Sn binary perovskites, for which the amount of Sn incorporated in the perovskite lattice is less and the superior semiconducting properties of the pristine APbI3 (A = Cs+, methylammonium (MA+) or formamidinium (FA+)) can be retained for realizing high performance.10,18 However, in contrast to Pb–Sn binary perovskites, the development of efficient ASnX3 PSCs needs much more elaborate efforts.19,20
In general, to effectively retard Sn oxidation for achieving efficient pure ASnX3 PSCs, precise control of the precursor solution state and the resulting film morphology is a prerequisite.21,22 Recently, SnF2 has been demonstrated as an effective additive to prevent the oxidation of Sn2+ and has been widely used for Sn-based film deposition. Lately, by coupling the SnF2 additive with morphological engineering, Seok and co-workers have reported an efficient and stable (with encapsulation) conventional n–i–p FASnI3 PSC with a PCE of 4.8%.22 Soon after, Yan and co-workers employed a similar deposition method to realize an improved PCE of 6.22% in an inverted p–i–n device configuration,23 reflecting the importance of device engineering on Sn-based PSCs. Very recently, Diau and co-workers realized a robust Sn-based PSC with a PCE of about 10%.24
Earlier research suggested that CsSnI3 exhibits p-type metallic behavior with low carrier density,25 and therefore it is not suitable for photovoltaic applications. Moreover, compared with MASnI3, FASnI3 crystals are much better for air stability and their conductivity can be tuned from p-type to intrinsic by varying the growth conditions.8,26 Thus, FASnI3 has much better performance than MASnI3 in photovoltaic applications. FASnI3, however, has a slightly larger band gap (1.41 eV)27 than the optimum value (1.30 eV)28 for single junction solar cells and thus its maximum theoretically efficiency is much lower than that of MAPbI3 PSC.
Recently, Zheng et al. reported that the ionization energy of an A site molecule is a very important factor that determines the thermodynamical stability of APbI3 hybrid halide perovskites and the lower ionization energy of the cations favors a more stable perovskite structure.29 Subsequently, they proposed a much lower ionization energy organic molecule ((CH2)2NH2)2+ (AZ) than that of CH3NH3 (MA) and HC(NH2)2 (FA) to be used as the organic cation at the A site of hybrid halide perovskites, which demonstrated that the low ionization energy of organic radical (CH2)2NH2 decreases the reaction enthalpy of forming the corresponding perovskite, and this lower reaction enthalpy renders a much better stability of AZPbI3 than MAPbI3 and FAPbI3.30
Herein, we propose a lead-free halide perovskite (CH2)2NH2SnI3 (AZSnI3) as well as related alloys AZSnI3−xBrx, for stable and high-performance photovoltaic absorber materials, based on first-principles calculations. We demonstrate that AZSnI3 and alloys AZSnI3−xBrx possess appropriate band gaps and have higher optical absorption than MAPbI3 in general.
2. Computational details
All calculations are performed using density functional theory (DFT) with the projected augmented wave (PAW) method as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).31–33 The valence electron configurations involved in the calculations are chosen as H (1s1), C (2s22p2), N (2s22p3), Sn (4d105s25p2), I (5s25p5) and the exchange–correlation functional is described by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) via the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional.34 Because van der Waals (vdW) effects are important for the polymorphism of MAPbI3,35 these can be extended for other types of organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskites. Thus, the PBE + vdW (D3)36 exchange–correlation functional is also adopted in our calculations. Here, we choose the cubic AZSnI3 with a space group of Pmm for simulation, as the difference of our calculated formation enthalpies between its cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic phases is within 10 meV per formula unit (cf. Section 3.1). The lattice parameters as well as the atomic positions are fully relaxed until the Hellmann–Feynman force on each atom is within 0.01 eV Å−1. A Monkhorst–Pack37 scheme 6 × 6 × 6 and the 8 × 8 × 8 Γ-centered k-point mesh over the first Brillion were used for the calculation of the structural optimization and electronic/optical properties, respectively. The wave function is expanded by plane-waves with an energy cut-off at 520 eV. Our previous investigation showed that the effect of spin–orbit coupling (SOC) is quite small on the calculated bandgap of the Sn-based halide perovskite (FASnI3), unlike that of the Pb-based perovskite.26 The calculated bandgap of FASnI3 is narrowed to 0.21 eV when SOC is considered. Thus, to balance the computational cost and computational accuracy in this work, Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06)38 based calculations are performed. Taking CsSnI3 as a reference to correct the HSE06 band gap by varying the mixing rate (μ) of the Hartree–Fock exchange potential with the experimental band gap (1.30 eV),39,40μ = 0.30 is in excellent agreement with the experiment value, yielding the calculated bandgap of 1.30 eV. Therefore, the above set is also employed for the calculation of the electronic structure in this work.
Based on the accurate electronic structure, the imaginary part ε2(ω) of the dielectric function dependence on the incidence optical frequency can be acquired, and the real part ε1(ω) can be estimated through Kramers–Kronig transformation. The optical absorption coefficient I(ω) can be obtained according to the following equation:41 (1)
For the defect calculations, a 3 × 3 × 3 supercell containing 351 atoms is employed, with the corresponding Brillouin zone sampled by the Γ point. The atomic coordinates are relaxed until the force on each atom is below 0.05 eV Å−1. The defect formation energy ΔH(α,q) has been calculated using the following equation:42 (2)where E(α,q) and Eh are the total energies of a supercell containing the defect in the charge state q and a perfect host supercell, respectively. ni indicates the number of i atoms added (ni > 0) or removed (ni < 0) when a defect is formed. Δμi is the relative chemical potential of i depending on the experimental conditions and Ei is the total energy of i as the pure elemental solid or molecule. Ev is the valence band maximum (VBM) and EF is the Fermi energy referred to the VBM. The transition level of the defect ε(q/q′) is defined as the Fermi level at which the formation energies of defect α with charge states q and q′ are equal42 ε(q/q′) = [ΔH(α,q) − ΔH(α,q′)]/(q′ − q),(3)where ΔH(α,q) and ΔH(α,q′) are the formation energies of defect α with charge states q and q′, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural properties
The main issues of popular halide perovskite MAPbI3 with an excellent PV performance are its poor structural and chemical stability along with the serious issue of lead (Pb) toxicity. Structural stability could be defined as the ability of a material to exist in a perovskite phase with suitable PV performance with the limitations of temperature and pressure.43 Here, we have considered the cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic structures of AZSnI3. Previous results suggested that moisture or oxygen in the environment causes the poor stability of MAPbI3 films,44,45 whereas the subsequent theoretical analysis suggested that the material is intrinsically thermodynamically unstable with respect to phase separation into PbI2 and MAI.46 Herein, decomposition enthalpies (ΔHd) of the considered three types of AZSnI3 are calculated by the following decomposition reaction equation AZSnI3 → AZI + SnI2(4)and the corresponding enthalpy ΔHd = Etot[AZSnI3] − Etot[AZI] − Etot[SnI2](5)The calculated ΔHd values are −91, −98, and −99 meV per formula unit (f.u.), respectively. These negative ΔHd values indicate that all three types of AZSnI3 will not decompose spontaneously. For MAPbI3, the ΔHd values reported in the literature for the decomposition reaction into MAI and PbI2 secondary phases are largely energetically unfavored30 and can even be decomposed spontaneously,30,46,47 indicating that MAPbI3 exhibits intrinsic thermal instability, which is consistent with the molecular dynamic calculation and the experimental results.48,49 Therefore, the AZSnI3 perovskites are expected to be more stable than the mainstream perovskite MAPbI3. Here, we do not discuss whether the organic cation AZ can mitigate the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ in AZSnI3. Nevertheless, one may calculate the decomposition energies of AZSnI3, MASnI3 and FASnI3, in which the decomposition products have Sn4+-based compounds, to evaluate whether AZ can mitigate the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+. Also, the chemical potential region (like Fig. 1(b)) can be adopted to evaluate whether AZ can mitigate the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ from the area of Sn4+-based compounds in the region.
 Fig. 1  (a) Schematic perovskite structure of AZSnI3. (b) Calculated chemical ranges for forming AZI, SnI2, and AZSnI3 (middle red region). Three representative points A (μI = −0.09 eV, μSn = −1.48 eV, μAZ = −3.63 eV), B (μI = −0.93 eV, μSn = 0 eV, μAZ = −2.32 eV), and C (μI = −0.47 eV, μSn = −0.74 eV, μAZ = −2.96 eV) are used for further investigation of defect properties. 
Materials with ABX3 composition can adapt different crystal structures depending on the size and interaction of cation A and the corner-sharing BX6 octahedral. Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t) is a reliable empirical index to predict which structure is preferentially formed.50 The Goldschmidt tolerance factor is calculated from the ionic radius of the atoms using the following expression:  where rA is the radius of cation A, rB is the radius of cation B, and rX is the radius of the anion. According to an earlier report,4 a cubic perovskite structure can be formed when t is around 0.95 but not exceeding 1. For the AZSnI3 structure, A is the organic AZ+, generally with rA = 2.27 Å;30 X is the halogen anion, where we adopt rI = 2.2 Å to get a reasonable t. Cation B is Sn here with rB = 1.12 Å, and thus leading to a calculated factor of 0.95, which is substantially suitable for the cubic perovskite structure. Consequently, we adopt cubic AZSnI3 with space group Pmm in the following study and the optimized stable structure is shown in Fig. 1(a). The calculated lattice constants are a = b = c = 6.34 Å.
Under thermodynamic equilibrium growth conditions, the chemical potentials are constrained in ranges that promote the growth of AZSnI3 and exclude the formation of secondary phases, such as SnI2 and AZI. Therefore, the chemical potentials should satisfy μAZ + μSn + 3μI = ΔH(AZSnI3)(−5.11 eV)(6)where μi is the chemical potential of the constituent element referred to as its most stable phase and ΔH(AZSnI3) is the formation enthalpy of AZSnI3. For μAZ, we choose face-centered-cubic phase of AZ following bulk Cs. To exclude the possible secondary phase SnI2 and AZI (rock-salt phase), the following constraints must also be satisfied μAZ + μI < ΔH(AZI)(−3.26 eV)(7) μSn+ 2μI < ΔH(SnI2)(−1.58 eV)(8)
The chemical potentials of Sn and I satisfying eqn (6)–(8) are illustrated in the red region of Fig. 1(b), in which AZSnI3 is stable against possible competing phases including AZI and SnI2. The stable chemical potential window for AZSnI3 has a long but narrow shape, typical for halide perovskites, indicating that the chemical growth condition should be carefully controlled to form pure AZSnI3.
3.2. Electronic properties
The band structure is important for determining many physical properties, such as the absorption and effective mass of carriers, which are crucial for evaluating a new material for potential solar cell applications. The calculated band structure of AZSnI3 using the HSE06 functional with 0.30 of exchange potential is displayed in the left panel of Fig. 2. Overall, the band structure is quite similar to that of cubic MAPbI3, where the conduction band minimum (CBM) and VBM are located at the R point with a gap of 1.06 eV. To further understand the electronic structure of AZSnI3, the density of states (DOS) are plotted in the right panel of Fig. 2. From the projected DOS (PDOS), the organic cation AZ has little contribution to the bands around VBM and CBM, resembling the case of other organic halide perovskites. VBM is mainly contributed by I 5p-orbitals and Sn 5s-orbitals, forming strong anti-bonding coupling, while CBM is contributed by Sn 5p. These electronic-structure features are similar to those of MASnI3,51 another prototype Sn-based perovskite that has gained increasing attention in the photovoltaic field. Both conduction and valence band edges exhibit dispersive bands, suggesting small carrier effective masses, which are turned to be 0.35 m0, and 0.23 m0 for electrons and holes, respectively.

For a single p–n junction on an AM 1.5 solar spectrum, the maximum theoretical efficiency of a solar cell is 33.7%, a value known as the Shockley–Queisser limit.28 The electronic band gap of the absorber material is one of the key quantities to assure high efficiency for a solar cell. Ideally, the band gap value should be within the optimal range of 1.1–1.45 eV in order to approach the maximum theoretical efficiency. As mentioned above, the band gap of AZSnI3 (1.06 eV), however, is slightly lower than the optimal band gap. Alloying with isovalent elements has been successfully used to tune the band gaps of solar cell absorbers, such as MA(Sn,Pb)I3 and CsSn(I,Br)3.52–54 As the conduction and valence bands are derived mainly from the Sn 5p, as well as I 5p and Sn 5s states, respectively, the band gap of AZSnI3 can be raised by alloying with isovalent elements that exhibit either p states higher in energy than Sn 5p or s states lower in energy than I 5p states. Considering the atomic size and electronegativity mismatch, Pb and Br are the first choices for alloying AZSnI3. Pb, however, possesses a toxic character. Instead, Br is selected for alloying AZSnI3 here. The calculated band gaps of AZSnI3−xBrx using the HSE06 functional are shown in Fig. 3a. For each composition, various configurations with Br occupying different I sites have been considered, but only the lowest-energy configuration was chosen for band gap calculations. It is seen that alloying with Br can increase the band gap of AZSnI3 effectively, as it increases almost linearly with the Br concentration. It should be noted that the change of Sn–I bond length in alloy AZSnI3−xBrx is not linear, whereas the average Sn–I bond length in AZSnI3, AZSnI2Br and AZSnIBr2 is 3.01 Å, 3.07 Å and 3.22 Å. It leads to the band gap increase with Br content which is not linear. As shown in Fig. 3b, AZSnI2Br possesses a direct band gap of 1.31 eV, making it an optimal candidate for the light-absorber layer in single-junction perovskite solar cells following the Shockley–Queisser limit for single junction solar cells. Both the CBM and VBM of AZSnI2Br are localized at point R. From the PDOS, it is clear that VBM is predominantly contributed by I 5p-orbitals and Sn 5s-orbitals, as well a very small amount of Br 5p-orbitals, while the CBM is predominantly contributed by Sn 5p-orbitals. AZSnI2Br exhibits a similar band structure and DOS as AZSnI3, except for its ideal band gap. Besides, the band edges of the valence band and conduction band are rather dispersive, expecting good carrier mobility like AZSnI3. In fact, the calculated effective masses are 0.65 m0 and 0.26 m0 for electrons and holes, respectively.

Optical absorption is another important criterion for solar-cell materials. Apart from ambipolar conductivity, high optical absorption is one of the unique properties of hybrid perovskites, in which photon-generated carriers do not have to travel far in absorber layers to be collected at the contacts so that the nonradiative recombination rate is low. Fig. 3c shows calculated absorption spectra of AZSnI3−xBrx in comparison with the typical perovskite MAPbI3. It shows that AZSnI3 has the maximum optical absorption in the entire visible solar spectrum in the studied systems. The results agree well with an earlier study,27 where the optical absorption of Sn–I perovskites was reported to be stronger than that of Pb–I counterparts. With increasing I/Br ratio, the absorption is continuously red-shifted, consistent with the trend of band gap change. In addition, we find that the optical absorption coefficients of AZSnI3−xBrx are even higher than that of MAPbI3, as shown in Fig. 3c. As a result, AZSnI3 and AZSnI3−xBrx alloy perovskite devices are able to use even thinner absorbers to achieve high efficiencies, relative to the mainstream perovskite MAPbI3. The choices of absorbers with ultrahigh optical absorption are particularly beneficial to cell performance as strong absorption ensures the harvesting of enough sunlight with extremely thin layers, thus shortening the diffusion length of the photoexcited carriers. This can effectively reduce the nonradiative recombination and enhance the open circuit voltages of the associated solar cells.
It is well known that large static dielectric constants can effectively screen the interaction between carriers and charged defects and impurities, thus improving the carrier lifetime and diffusion length. Here, the static dielectric constants for AZSnI3 and AZSnI2Br are calculated. The calculated result of AZSnI3 is εxxeff = 29.72, εyyeff = 30.77 and εzzeff = 56.42. The result in AZSnI2Br is εxxeff = 96.39, εyyeff = 7.44 and εzzeff = 10.02. Our calculated result shows that the values of static dielectric constants for AZSnI3 and AZSnI2Br are comparable to that of MAPbI3,55 which suggests that AZSnI3 and AZSnI2Br have excellent carrier transport properties like in MAPbI3.
3.3. Defect properties
Solar cell performance depends critically on the defect properties of the light absorbers. To optimize the performance, it is important to find growth conditions that suppress the formation of the unwanted deep-level defects and promote the desirable defects. We have calculated the transition energy levels and formation energies of intrinsic point defects in AZSnI3. These results also provide a reference to the defect properties in AZSnI3−xBrx alloys.
We have considered 12 possible intrinsic point defects in AZSnI3, including three vacancies (VAZ, VSn, VI), three interstitials (AZi, Sni, Ii), two cation substitutions (AZSn, SnAZ), and four antisite substitutions (AZI, SnI, IAZ and ISn). The calculated transition energies of these point defects are shown in Fig. 4. The donor-like defects are marked in red as shown in Fig. 4a, while the acceptor-like defects are in blue as shown in Fig. 4b. Only four defects (SnI, Sni, IAZ, ISn) produce deep levels. Other point defects produce shallow levels: AZi, AZI, SnAZ, and VI are shallow donors, whereas AZSn, Ii, VAZ and VSn are shallow acceptors.
 Fig. 4  Calculated transition energy levels of intrinsic defects in AZSnI3. The red and blue bars represent the donor levels (a) and acceptor levels (b), respectively. 
The formation energies of point defects depend on the chemical potentials of the constituent elements. We have selected three representative chemical potential points, i.e., different growth conditions for calculating the formation energies of point defects: A (I-rich/Sn-poor), B (moderate), and C (I-poor/Sn-rich), which are marked in Fig. 1b. We first calculated the formation energies for charge-neutral defects as a function of chemical potentials, as shown in Fig. 5. The solid lines indicate defects with shallow levels, whereas the dotted lines show defects with deep levels. It is seen that, at chemical point A (I-rich/Sn-poor), the defect with deep level, IAZ exhibits the lowest formation energies. At chemical potential point C (I-poor/Sn-rich), the defect with shallow level, VI exhibits the lowest formation energies.
 Fig. 5  Calculated formation energies of charge-neutral defects in AZSnI3 as a function of chemical potential, where the detailed chemical potential values corresponding to A, B, C are shown in Fig. 1b. 
The p/n electrical conductivity of a semiconductor is determined by the Fermi-level position, which is pinned by the most stable charged acceptor and donor defects in the system. We have calculated the formation energies of the above point defects as a function of Fermi-level position at three representative chemical potential points-A (I-rich/Sn-poor), B (moderate), and C (I-poor/Sn-rich). The results are shown in Fig. 6a–c. Defects with relatively high formation energies are indicated with dashed lines, while solid lines are for defects with relatively low formation energies. At chemical potential points A and B, the Fermi-level positions are pinned below the VBM, indicating degenerate p-type conductivity. At chemical potential point C, however, the Fermi-level position is pinned at 0.33 eV above the VBM by the formation of VSn and VI, indicating moderate p-type conductivity.
 Fig. 6  Calculated formation energies of intrinsic point defects as a function of the Fermi level at three representative chemical potential points: (a) A (I-rich/Sn-poor), (b) B (moderate), and (c) C (I-poor/Sn-rich). 
Therefore, AZSnI3 perovskite films grown under conditions of I-rich/Sn-poor and moderate are expected to be strong p-type semiconductors. High carrier concentration is preferred for contact layers but not for absorbers due to the high recombination of minority carriers. Our results suggest that I-poor/Sn-rich growth conditions may be applicable for synthesizing AZSnI3-based perovskite absorbers as the formation of deep-level defects can be suppressed, and the carrier density can be maintained at moderate levels.
3.4. Stability of AZSnI3−xBrx alloys
We have further studied the stability of AZSnI3−xBrx alloys by calculating the energies needed to decompose the alloys back to the binary phases, such as AZI, AZBr, SnI2 and SnBr2 or the ternary phases AZSnI3 and AZSnBr3. The decomposition energies are defined as positive energies that do not favor energetic decomposition of the alloy: Ed(B) = (3 − x)Etotal(AZI) + xEtotal(AZBr) + xEtotal(SnBr2) + (3 − x)Etotal(SnI2) − 3EtotalAZSn(I3−xBrx)(9) Ed(T) = (3 − x)(AZSnI3) + x(AZSnBr3) − 3AZSn(I3−xBrx)(10)
Here, B and T indicate the decompositions into binary and ternary secondary phases, respectively. Etotal is the calculated total energy of a considered unit cell. As listed in Table 1, the alloys AZSnI3−xBrx do not decompose into binary phases. The calculated decomposition energies, however, are negative when decomposing into the ternary phases, although the values are rather small, indicating a weak segregation trend in the alloys. Nevertheless, Yan et al. reported that unstable alloys may be synthesized under nonequilibrium growth or compressively strained growth conditions.56

Moreover, the stability of the compounds depends on temperature, which affects the entropy contribution due to mixed configurations and lattice vibrations. Herein, we calculate the entropy of mixing using the following equation: ΔS = −kB[xln(x) + (1 − x)ln(1 − x)](11)
The maximum contribution of mixing entropy (corresponding to x = 0.5) to the Helmholtz energy at room temperature is about −17.3 meV per atom, which will be beneficial for the stability of multi-component alloys. In general, the lattice vibration contribution to the ternary compound should be considered for binary decomposition energy. In our study, however, it takes huge computational resources to complete the phonon spectrum calculations for the compounds in different ratios. We noticed from the earlier study57 that the phonon spectrums are similar for Cs1−xRbxPbI3 (Cs1−xRbxI) with x = 0, 0.2, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0. This implies that the contributions of lattice vibration to the decomposition energy will mostly be canceled out. Therefore, we expect that our estimation of decomposition without the consideration of the lattice vibration is reasonable.
4. Conclusions
To summarize, we propose the tin-based lead-free halide perovskite AZSnI3 as well as alloys AZSnI3−xBrx, for stable and high-performance photovoltaic absorber materials. We find that the perovskite AZSnI3 has much better stability than mainstream MAPbI3 and possesses a band gap of 1.06 eV. Furthermore, it is found that I-poor/Sn-rich growth conditions are appropriate to suppress the formation of deep-level defects when synthesizing AZSnI3-based perovskite absorbers to maintain moderate carrier density. In addition, the alloy (CH2)2NH2SnI2Br has an ideal band gap of 1.31 eV, which is optimal for single junction solar cells. The calculated optical absorption of alloys AZSnI3−xBrx is mostly higher than MAPbI3.
