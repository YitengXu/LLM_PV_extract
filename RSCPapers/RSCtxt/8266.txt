The resulting β-singly- and doubly-substituted porphyrin dyes are regarded as isomeric derivatives of the corresponding meso-substituted reference systems, and were found to give rise to nearly equal power conversion efficiencies when analyzed in DSSCs.
Porphyrins are an important family of organic chromophores that has attracted attention as photosensitizers in TiO2-based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).1 Relatively high photovoltaic efficiencies have been demonstrated in DSSCs based on “push(donor)–pull(acceptor)” structured porphyrin dyes.2 A key feature of successful push–pull porphyrin sensitizers is the unidirectional “D–π–A” arrangement of the electron donating substituent, typically a diarylamine, and the electron-acceptor, an ethynylbenzoic acid anchoring group, across the 5- and 15-(meso) positions of the porphyrin core. A breakthrough in the world of DSSCs was attained recently, wherein a power conversion efficiency (η) of 11.9% was obtained using porphyrin-sensitized cells of this general structure (viz., YD2-o-C8; Chart 1) and a cobalt-based redox electrolyte system.3 The outstanding results obtained using YD2-o-C8 provide an incentive to develop synthetic methods that would allow a range of “D–π–A2” porphyrin sensitizers to be prepared such that the effect of structural modification on functional efficiency can be probed in detail. Of particular interest within the cadre of this generalized approach would be elucidating the effect of β-pyrrolic vs. meso-substitution of acceptor subunits. In previous work, we reported the preparation of doubly β-vinylogous-linked porphyrins where the alkenyl spacer was thought to play a role in improving the overall efficiency by mediating effective charge separation.4 In the present study, we report a new set of porphyrin-based photosensitizers prepared through a direct palladium-catalyzed alkynylation reaction of β-borylated porphyrins with various terminal alkyne derivatives. It was expected that the presence of the rigid CC triple-bond and the resulting enhancement of electronic communication through the β-positions would facilitate effective electron injection into the conduction band of the TiO2. As detailed below, the DSSC efficiencies of β-(4-ethynylbenzoic acid)-substituted derivatives (singly- and doubly-substituted; ZnEP1 and ZnEP2, respectively) proved to be nearly equal to the corresponding meso-linked derivative (i.e., YD15) as measured using a sensitized TiO2 photoelectrode (Chart 1).

The iridium(I) catalyst-assisted borylated porphyrins (1a: mono-boryl and 1b: di-boryl porphyrins) are potentially useful precursors for direct alkynyl coupling reactions.6 We thus sought to effect the cross-coupling between the porphyrin borylester derivative (1a) and the readily available terminal acetylene derivative 2b to access the corresponding zinc porphyrin ZnEPn (n = 1 or 2). To date, there have been few studies involving the oxidative alkynylation reactions of analogous borylated precursors, although it was found that Pd/Ag7 or Cu catalysts8 were not effective when tested with large π-conjugated porphyrins (cf. ESI†). After extensive screening of reaction conditions, we found that mild palladium-catalyzed aerobic oxidative coupling of β-borylated porphyrins, 1 with various terminal alkynes, 2 allows access to the desired the cross-linked products (3) in satisfactory yields (Scheme 1 and Fig. S1, ESI†). Electron deficient alkynes (e.g., 2e and 2f) proved to be less reactive compared to electron rich ones (e.g., 2c and 2d); however, a variety of terminal alkynes were tolerated. The procedure was sufficiently robust that the doubly-(methyl ethynylbenzoate)-substituted derivative (3g) could be isolated in 15% yield starting from the diborylated derivative (1b).9 A proposed mechanism for the coupling reaction is provided in the ESI† (cf. Scheme S1).10

The isolated methyl ester derivatives (3f and 3g) could be easily hydrolyzed under basic conditions. The final products, ZnEP1 and ZnEP2, were characterized by 1H- and 13C-NMR spectroscopy and high resolution FAB mass spectrometry (ESI†).
The light-harvesting ability of ZnEP1 and ZnEP2 was confirmed by steady-state absorption spectroscopy in CH2Cl2 (Fig. 1a). These two ZnEPns exhibited Soret bands and Q-bands in 400–500 and 550–700 nm spectral ranges, respectively, which were broadened and red-shifted as the number of β-linkages increased (λmax = 422 nm; ε = 1.59 × 105 M−1 cm−1 for ZnEP1 and λmax = 439 nm; ε = 1.31 × 105 M−1 cm−1 for ZnEP2).11 The absorption spectra of ZnEPn are also characterized by a shoulder at 450–500 nm, which is not present in the spectrum of the meso-linked analogue YD1.5 The spectral features are thought to reflect the electronic interaction between the porphyrin macrocyclic core and the β-ethynylaryl substituents resulting in an effective extension in the overall π-conjugation.

In accord with what was seen in the absorption spectral studies, the fluorescence maxima of ZnEP1 and ZnEP2 also shift to lower energy as the degree of substitution increases (Fig. 1b).11 The zero–zero excitation energies (E0–0) are estimated to be 1.91 and 1.85 eV for ZnEP1 and ZnEP2, respectively (Table S1, ESI†). The time-resolved fluorescence decay profiles of ZnEP1 and ZnEP2 recorded in CH2Cl2 could fit well as a single exponential decay with a time constant of 1.46 and 1.35 ns, respectively (Fig. S3, ESI†). It is worth noting that the observed excited state lifetimes are longer than the electron injection rate (meaning deactivation is unlikely to compete with the electron injection into TiO2).12
The electrochemical properties of ZnEP1 and ZnEP2 were investigated by cyclic voltammetry in THF containing 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as the supporting electrolyte (Table S1, ESI†). The oxidation potentials for ZnEP1 and ZnEP2 were determined to be approximately 1.0 V (vs. NHE), which is comparable to those of the other diarylamine-substituted porphyrins.5,13 The injection potential (Eox*) was evaluated by subtracting the excitation energy (E0–0) from the oxidation potential (Eox) of the porphyrins, giving values of −1.14 V and −1.08 V (vs. NHE) for ZnEP1 and ZnEP2, respectively. Based on the optical and electrochemical parameters, the driving force for electron injection (ΔGinj) from the porphyrin excited state to the conduction band of the TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE) and the regeneration (ΔGreg) of the porphyrin radical cation by the Co(II/III) redox couple (+0.56 V vs. NHE) for DSSCs built from ZnEP1 and ZnEP2 are expected to be thermodynamically favoured (ΔG < 0).
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level to gain insight into the charge transfer character of the dyes (Fig. S4 and Table S3, ESI†). The overall electron distribution pattern of the two ZnEPns of this study is essentially similar to that of YD1.5 Despite the lower molecular symmetry of ZnEP1 compared to that of YD1, the characteristic orbital densities and phases are retained. Specifically, ZnEP1 and ZnEP2 were predicted to be dipolar in nature, which is expected to facilitate efficient and rapid electron injection into the CB of TiO2, as seen in other push–pull porphyrin derivatives.2 The time-dependent DFT analyses of ZnEP1 and ZnEP2 were also consistent with the experimental absorption spectra (Fig. S5, ESI†).
To clarify the effect of the number (1 vs. 2) and orientation (β- vs. meso-) of the linkage, DSSCs were fabricated using ZnEPns as photosensitizers and mesoporous anatase TiO2 spheres (diameter ∼ 600 nm) prepared by an electrostatic spray method.14 The photovoltaic properties of these two porphyrins were then investigated under AM 1.5 irradiation conditions (100 mW cm−2) using a Co(bpy)3-based electrolyte.15 The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the sandwich type cells sensitized with ZnEP1 and ZnEP2 in the presence of 2 equiv. of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) as a co-adsorbent allowed the short circuit photocurrent density (JSC, mA cm−2), open circuit voltage (VOC, V), and fill factor (FF) to be calculated. This yielded an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 5.9% for ZnEP1 and 4.0% for ZnEP2 according to the equation, η = JSC × VOC × FF (Fig. 2a and Table 1).

The efficiency of the doubly β-ethynylphenyl-substituted ZnEP2 used in the present study proved to be inferior to that of singly-substituted ZnEP1 as manifest in the lower JSC value. The photocurrent action spectra of the ZnEP1-sensitizer cell exhibited a maximum incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of 54.5% at 450 nm that is also larger than in cells built up from ZnEP2 (27.3% at 470 nm) (Fig. 2b). This difference matched the absorption spectral features of the corresponding porphyrins adsorbed on the electrodes (Fig. S6, ESI†).
The photocurrent density of DSSCs is related to the efficiencies of (i) light harvesting (LHE), (ii) charge injection (φinj), and (iii) charge collection (ηcol).16 Among these factors, the LHE defined as LHE = 1 − 10−εΓ (where ε is the molar extinction coefficient of the dye and Γ is the molar concentration of the dye per projected surface area of the film) is thought to be dominant in accounting for the photocurrent generated by the cells prepared using ZnEPn of this study. Considering the similar absorption spectral features of the dyes, the larger Γ value of ZnEP1 (1.2 × 10−7 mol cm−2) as determined on our TiO2 electrode serves to enhance the overall efficiency of this porphyrin relative to ZnEP2 (Γ = 4.4 × 10−8 mol cm−2).
The dye aggregates on the surface are known to be one of the factors accounting for low efficiency.13a,17 On this basis we consider it possible that the tilted dye geometry of ZnEP2 serves to accelerate the back electron transfer process (Fig. S7, ESI†). In addition, the dihedral angle between the porphyrin core and the acceptor ethynylphenyl rings is larger in ZnEP2 than in ZnEP1 based on the optimized structures (Fig. S8, ESI;† 17.4° vs. 0.7°, respectively). This may disrupt the effective electronic communication through the β-ethynylphenyl π-bridges. To an extent this is true, it would help to rationalize the relatively poor power conversion efficiency seen for the doubly-bridged system.
In summary, we have demonstrated the use of a direct palladium-catalyzed oxidative alkynylation reaction of β-borylated porphyrins to obtain β-ethynylphenyl-substituted porphyrin derivatives. This has allowed us to obtain new alternative porphyrin-based sensitizers, ZnEPn for DSSCs. The photophysical and electrochemical properties of two ZnEPns were investigated and proved to be similar to those of a meso-substituted control system, YD1, confirming the viability of the present substitution strategy. It was also found that the power conversion efficiency of the monosubstituted ZnEP1 is superior to that of its doubly functionalized ZnEP2, leading us to suggest that further design optimization could produce yet-improved systems.
