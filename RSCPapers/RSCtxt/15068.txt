    , Accepted 20th February 2012First published on 21st February 2012AbstractThis review briefly summarizes recent advances in fluorine ions-mediated morphology control of anatase TiO2 in the forms of nanotube arrays, nanosheets with high-energy facets, and hollow spheres. The correlations between the enhanced photocatalytic activity and structural and morphological modifications of anatase TiO2 by fluorine ions are addressed.
1. Introduction
Decades of research have been directed toward semiconductor-based photocatalysts in environmental remediation and solar energy conversion.1–4 As a prototype photocatalyst, titanium dioxide (TiO2) has received the greatest attention due to its strong photo oxidization power, cost effectiveness, and long-term stability against photo- and chemical-corrosion. The primary event occurring on the UV-illuminated TiO2 is the generation of h+ and e− charge carriers, which can rapidly migrate to the surface to initiate a catalytic reaction when captured by a suitable electron donor and acceptor. Alternatively, h+ and e− charge carriers can recombine and dissipate the light energy into heat.5 The formation of highly oxidative species (e.g., ˙OH and O2˙−) during catalytic processes on the surfaces of metal oxide semiconductors is crucial for water and air detoxification as well as oxidation of organic compounds.6 Nevertheless, the overall efficiency for photocatalytic reactions to date is still not ideal for practical applications. Therefore, many methods, such as doping,7,8 noble metal deposition,9 surface modifications,5,10,11 semiconductor coupling12,13 and so on, have been explored to improve the efficiency. In particular, structure modifications of TiO2 by fluorine ions show great promise, in addition to tailoring the morphology of anatase TiO2.5,6,14
In this review, fluorine ions-mediated morphology control and enhanced photocatalytic activity of TiO2 are summarized. In particular, we focus on surface modifications, bulk doping, growth of a variety of morphologies (e.g., nanotubes, nanosheets with exposed (001) high-energy facets, hollow spheres), and phase transformation from amorphous-to-anatase TiO2 catalyzed by fluorine ions.
2. Fluoride surface modification
Minero and co-workers first reported the enhanced photocatalytic degradation of phenol on a titanium dioxide–fluoride system (fluorine effect).10,15 It was found that the substitution of the surface hydroxyl groups by fluorine ions on the TiO2 surfaces (eqn (1)) is a prerequisite for the formation of ˙OH free radicals (eqn (2)). The shielding effect of fluorine ions is proposed for the improved photocatalytic activity. Ti–OH + F− → Ti–F + OH− (pK1 = 6.2)(1) Ti–F + h+ + H2O → Ti–F + ˙OH free + H+(2)The shielding effect of fluorine ions on a titanium dioxide–fluoride system is due to the strong adsorption of fluorine ions on the surface of TiO2 and high potential of the couple F˙/F− (3.6 V), causing fluorine ions to be stable against oxidation by TiO2 valence holes even in acidic media. Fig. 1A shows the effect of solution pH and fluoride concentration on the surface speciation of TiO2 based on simulation. Note that there are four kinds of titanium species on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles in the presence of fluorine ions, i.e., Ti–OH2+, Ti–F, Ti–OH and Ti–O−. It can be seen that the adsorption of fluorine ions is very sensitive to solution pH, and acidic solution is more preferable for the adsorption of fluorine ions (seeing the difference of the equilibrium constants between eqns (1) and (3)).5 Ti–OH + H+ + F− → Ti–F + H2O (pK3 = −7.8)(3)Fig. 1B shows the ratios of the observed rate constants at [F−] = 0.01 M with respect to those at [F−] = 0 as a function of pH. The bell shape correlates with that shown in Fig. 1A for Ti–F species, albeit the maximum is slightly shifted toward higher pH. Fig. 1B indicates that the adsorption of fluoride is important in the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the titanium dioxide–fluoride system. Note that surface fluorination did not induce any etching of TiO2 particles, and the –OHsurf/F− exchange was reversible by simple treatment in concentrated basic solutions.16

A number of studies have shown that addition of NaF into aqueous dispersions of TiO2 in an acidic medium can result in significant enhancement in the rate of organic photocatalytic degradation, including phenol,14,17–20 benzoic acid,21 humic acid,22 cyanuric acid,23,24 benzene,25N-nitrosodimethylamine,26 tetramethylammonium,27,28 and dyes.5,17,19,21,29–36 Choi and co-worker studied the mobile nature of active species (˙OH free radicals) generated on fluorinated TiO2 (F–TiO2) under UV light. The surface oxidants not only migrate two-dimensionally but also desorb from the surface and form airborne oxidants.30,35 One particular example is the remote photocatalytic oxidation of rhodamine B (RhB) over surface fluorinated TiO2, where active oxygen species can penetrate and diffuse through a polymer membrane to oxidize the dye (Fig. 2).35 To date, the enhanced remote photocatalytic oxidation on the surface-fluorinated TiO2 has been extended to degradation of hazardous gases, such as acetone37 and acetaldehyde.38 The fluorine effect was also observed in other semiconductors such as iron (hydr)oxides.39 Macyk and co-worker24 recently reported that the surface modification of TiO2 with fluoride leads to the enhanced production of 1O2, which is responsible for the degradation of cyanuric acid (eqn (4)). Ti–F + O2 + hν → Ti–F + 1O2(4)In general, surface modification of TiO2 with NaF can promote the degradation of organic pollutants. However, disposal of fluoride-containing wastewater is not allowed by environmental regulations. Xu et al.40 modified TiO2 using a salt with negligible solubility in water, such as fluorite and fluorapatite. The modified catalysts displayed higher activity than that of bare TiO2 for the sorption and photocatalytic degradation of phenol and 2,4-dichlorophenol in water due to the formation of more hydroxyl radicals than bare TiO2. In addition, the fluorapatite-modified TiO2 was very stable and could be re-used without significant loss in activity.

2.1 Detection of hydroxyl radicals
The effect of alcohols on the photocatalytic rate of transformation has often been interpreted in terms of discriminating between direct hole oxidation and reaction with ˙OH radicals (either adsorbed or free). Minero used alcohols as a diagnostic tool for the analysis of the photocatalytic mechanism in a titanium dioxide–fluoride system.15 On pure TiO2, 90% of the oxidation of phenol proceeds through the reaction with surface bound hydroxyl radicals, and the remaining 10% via a direct interaction with the photogenerated holes. In contrast, on F–TiO2 the reaction proceeds almost entirely via homogeneous hydroxyl radicals because of the unavailability of surface-bound hydroxyl in the presence of fluoride ions (eqn (2)).15
The enhanced production of ˙OH radicals due to NaF addition was confirmed by Mrowetz and Selli,32 using a DMPO (5, 5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide)-spin trap EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) technique. Fig. 3A shows the EPR spectra of the DMPO–OH adduct formed after 5 min irradiation in pure and surface fluorinated TiO2 suspensions. It can be seen that a much higher DMPO–OH adduct signal was detected on F–TiO2 under the adopted experimental conditions. The kinetic profile of the DMPO–OH adduct formation shown in Fig. 3B confirms that a much higher amount of this species was produced on fluorinated TiO2 during irradiation. The initial photon efficiencies of DMPO–OH generation: ΦTiO2 = 2 × 10−3 on pure and ΦF–TiO2 = 3 × 10−2 on fluorinated TiO2.

However, Watanabe et al.23 suggested that the number of ˙OH radicals produced from UV-irradiated TiO2 (naked) and fluorinated TiO2 depend on the incident light irradiance. At low light irradiance a greater number of ˙OH radicals are formed on TiO2, whereas at high light irradiance a greater number of ˙OH radicals are form on fluorinated TiO2 (F–TiO2) than on pure TiO2 dispersions owing to a rapid degradation of the DMPO spin trap by surface-bound ˙OH radicals taking place on the naked particle surface.
2.2 Formation of H2O2
The effects of TiO2 surface fluorination on the hydrogen peroxide evolution occurring in photocatalytic runs have been extensively investigated. Maurino et al.6 showed that (1) UV irradiation of fluorinated TiO2 suspensions in water, in the presence of oxygen and a hole scavenger, leads to the production of H2O2 with steady state concentration levels up to 1.3 millimolar, and (2) the H2O2 formation rate follows the TiO2 surface speciation, being maximum when the surface is completely covered by Ti–F groups. It is suggested that surface fluoride, via a shielding effect at the semiconductor–water interface, inhibits the photocatalytic decomposition of H2O2.21
2.3 Mechanism of surface fluorine effects
In 2003, Yu et al.37a for the first time reported effects of trifluoroacetic acid modification on the surface microstructures and photocatalytic activity of mesoporous TiO2 thin films. They believed that fluorine, the most electronegative element, could exert a pull on the electron density of the C atoms (species IV). Furthermore, the CF3 groups of the adsorbed trifluoroacetate complexes on the TiO2 surface could attract the photogenerated electrons and reduced the recombination rate of the photogenerated electrons and holes, thus enhancing the photocatalytic activity of TiO2.37a After that, in 2004, Choi et al. reported that short-circuit photocurrents generated on an illuminated TiO2/Ti electrode are significantly reduced in the presence of F− (Fig. 4). The surface Ti–F group acts as an electron-trapping site to reduce interfacial electron transfer rates by tightly holding trapped electrons due to the strong electronegativity of the fluorine.17 This mechanism is similar to that proposed by Yu et al.37a Trifluoroacetate (carrying a strongly electron withdrawing -CF3 group) complexed on a TiO2 surface could trap CB electrons with a reduction of the charge-pair recombination. In 2009, Yu et al.37b further reported enhancement of photocatalytic activity of mesoporous TiO2 powders by hydrothermal surface fluorination treatment in photocatalytic oxidation decomposition of acetone in air. Their results showed that the photocatalytic activity of F–TiO2 powders was much higher than that of pure TiO2 and commercial Degussa P25 (P25) powders because the strong electron-withdrawing ability of the surface Ti–F groups reduces the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, and enhances the formation of free OH radicals. Especially, the F–TiO2 powder prepared at the nominal atomic ratio of fluorine to titanium of 0.5 showed the highest photocatalytic activity and its rate constant k exceeded that of P25 by a factor of more than 3 times.

Why did F–TiO2 powders exhibit the enhanced photocatalytic activity? One possible explanation is that the surface Ti–F group can trap the CB electrons by tightly holding trapped electrons due to the strongest electronegativity of the fluorine and then transfer them to O2 adsorbed on the surface of TiO2 (see Fig. 5), thus reducing the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes and enhancing the photocatalytic activity. One direct evidence is the formation rate of free OH radicals on F–TiO2 is much greater than that of surface-bound OH radicals on TiO2. Also, the redox potential of free OH radicals in solution (ca. 2.3 V vs. NHE at pH 7) is larger than that of surface-adsorbed OH radicals on TiO2 (about 1.5–1.7 V vs. NHE at pH 7).37b

Furthermore, UV-vis absorption spectra of the naked and fluorinated TiO2 indicate the absorption edge region is almost unaffected by the surface fluorination (see Fig. 6). This implies that surface fluorination has no obvious influence on the electronic absorption properties, valence band and conduction band of TiO2. This is not difficult to understand because F elements do not enter the lattice of TiO2.37

2.4 Adsorption and selective oxidation
The application of photocatalytic reactions to organic synthesis has received attention for the development of environmentally benign synthetic processes. It is well known that heterogeneous photocatalytic reactions primarily take place on the surface. Therefore, surface properties of TiO2 are important for photocatalytic efficiencies.41,42 Surface modification by fluoride can alter the adsorption properties of organic substrates on TiO2 and thus influence not only the rate of photo-induced reactions, but also their pathways, resulting from different surface charge distributions, modified substrate–surface interactions and the changes in the interfacial electron transfer rates.36 For example, Wang et al.31 reported that RhB preferentially anchors on pure TiO2 through the anionic carboxylic group (–COOH), while its adsorption group is switched to the cationic moiety (–NEt2 group) on F–TiO2 (Fig. 7). Both the photocatalytic degradation kinetics and mechanisms were drastically changed after surface fluorination. Dyes with positively charged nitrogen–alkyl groups underwent a rapid N-dealkylation process on F–TiO2, while on pure TiO2 direct cleavage of the dye chromophore ring structures predominated.

It has been proposed that the ˙OH-mediated oxidation pathways are enhanced on F–TiO2, whereas the hole transfer mediated oxidations are largely inhibited due to the hindered adsorption (or complexation) of substrates on F–TiO2. According to the results reported by Minero and others, the selectivity for the formation of catechol among all the dihydroxyphenol intermediates can be greatly enhanced when TiO2 is fluorinated in the photocatalytic degradation of phenol.10,14,18Table 1 lists the selectivity of catechol during the photocatalytic oxidation of phenol under UV irradiation of pure and F–TiO2 suspensions reported by Lv et al.18 It can be seen that the selectivity of catechol increased both in anatase and rutile TiO2 systems after surface modification. Furthermore, Xue et al.43 studied the photocatalytic selective oxidation of hexane by O2 into hexanone and hexanol on TiO2. They found that addition of a small amount of NaF into the aqueous TiO2 suspension could result in significant enhancement in the photocatalytic activity of anatase-type TiO2. As the fluoride concentration was increased, the amount of hexanone and hexanol, and the molar ratio of hexanol to hexanone, were increased toward saturation. Park et al.25 studied the photocatalytic conversion from benzene to phenol and found that the phenol yield was increased up to two-fold upon surface fluorination, resulting from enhanced production of mobile (free) ˙OH radicals on F–TiO2. The molar ratio of produced catechol to phenol was increased about 20 fold (from 0.01 to 0.19).

2.5 Synergistic effects of surface fluorination and other factors
Lv and Xu14,18,44 correlated the phase structure of synthesized TiO2 with surface fluorination. The effect of surface fluorination is determined by the photocatalytic activity of naked TiO2. The higher the photoactivity of naked TiO2, the stronger the fluoride effect. Photo-induced electron transfer from the conduction band of rutile TiO2 to oxygen is proposed as the rate determination step for the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants. On the other hand, rutile TiO2 showed a negative fluoride effect. However, if Ag+ is used as an electron scavenger instead of oxygen, a positive fluoride effect is observed for rutile TiO2. As for anatase TiO2, a positive fluoride effect was observed in the presence of Ag+, albeit the effect is not as significant as that of rutile TiO2.14 Wang et al.20 studied the synergistic effects of cupric and fluoride ions on photocatalytic degradation of phenol. The rate constant (k) of the phenol photodegradation was 0.010 min−1 in the absence of Cu2+ and F− ions, and was increased up to 0.014 min−1 by adding 0.4 mmol L−1 Cu2+, and to 0.022 min−1 by adding 5 mmol L−1 F− ions. The coexistence of both Cu2+ and F− ions increased the k value further to 0.041 min−1, about 4.1 fold that without adding Cu2+ and F− ions. Furthermore, Lv et al.29 investigated the synergistic effects of hollow structure and surface fluorination on the photocatalytic activity of anatase TiO2. The rate constant for the photocatalytic degradation of the dye increased from 6.68 and 21.02 min−1 to 14.63 and 33.80 min−1 after surface fluorinated for TiO2 nanoparticles and hollow microspheres, respectively. The enhanced photocatalytic activity upon surface fluorination on TiO2 hollow microspheres is more significant than that of nanoparticles. This can be rationalized that compared with that of solid TiO2 nanoparticles, the smaller grain size of hollow TiO2 microspheres can result in a more positive valence band potential level.
3. Fluoride ions doping and adsorption

Fig. 8 shows typical high-resolution XPS spectra of F 1s core-level for F-doped TiO2 powders prepared by hydrolysis of titanium tetraisopropoxide in a mixed NH4F–H2O solution, followed by calcination at different temperatures. Two types of fluorine in different chemical states (i.e., adsorbed and doped in the lattice) can be seen. Peaks located at 684 and 688 eV correspond to surface fluoride (Ti–F) formed by ligand exchange between F− and surface hydroxyl groups (eqn (1)) and doped F− in the lattice of TiO2, respectively.17,45–47

Li et al.48 prepared F-doped TiO2 powders by spray pyrolysis from an aqueous solution of H2TiF6. The doped fluorine atoms existed in two chemical states, either in TiOF2 or in substitutional fluorine atoms in TiO2 crystal lattice. Under either UV or visible light irradiation, the as-prepared F-doped TiO2 showed enhanced photocatalytic activity toward decomposition of gas-phase acetaldehyde, which is better than that of commercial P-25 TiO2. The visible photocatalytic activity of F-doped TiO2 powders was achieved by surface oxygen vacancies rather than the improvement of optical absorption property in visible region of bulk TiO2. Based on the photoluminescence spectra which reveal the processes of the radiative recombination of charge carriers between two different energy states, the structural model of energy states formed in F doped TiO2 is shown in Fig. 9.

The formation of oxygen vacancies due to F doping was also suggested by Ho et al.49 In this study, hierarchical nanoporous F-doped TiO2 spheres were synthesized by hydrothermal treatment of TiF4 solution. The self-generated etchant HF not only provides the nucleation center for the growth of porous spheres, but also acts as the source of F-dopant. When TiF4 was used as the starting material, most of the fluorine in TiF4 was hydrolyzed and the resulting residual fluorine remained as a dopant in the TiO2 lattice. Indeed, F-doping does not cause a shift in the absorption edge of TiO2. However, hierarchical nanoporous F-doped TiO2 is very effective in the photocatalytic degradation of 4-chlorophenol under visible light illumination.
Wang et al.50 reported the unusual role of F in tailoring the band structure of N-doped TiO2. Combing theoretical calculations and experimental results, they demonstrated that incorporating F into N-doped TiO2 enhances the oxidative power of the hVB, but reduces the reduction ability of eCB. These results imply that the binary doping of a photocatalyst can be an effective strategy to tune the band structure. Accordingly, it may provide useful information for the design of new photocatalysts and to control the photocatalytic reactions. Further studies showed that the crystallinity of anatase TiO2 was improved upon F-doping, and fluorine ions prevented phase transition of anatase to rutile.45,51,52 Very recently, it was also reported47 that the thermal stability of anatase TiO2 nanosheets with exposed high-energy {001} facets shows superior thermal stability against phase transition up to 1100 °C, which is associated with the surface fluorination by inhibiting the extension of Ti–O–Ti bridging and thus the growth of TiO2 nanocrystals (Fig. 10). The effect of surface fluorination on the thermal stability of anatase TiO2 was also reported by Zhang et al.53,54 Surprisingly, the positive effect of fluorine-doping on the enhanced photocatalytic activity was also reported on other semiconductors such as SrTiO3,55 Bi2WO6,56 Ti1−xZrxO257 and In(OH)ySz.58

4. Morphology controlling agent
4.1 TiO2 nanotube arrays
Since Zwilling et al.59 first synthesized thin films of highly ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNAs) by anodization of titanium foils in a HF containing electrolyte in 1999, anodized TNAs thin films have received considerable attention for their particular architectures and remarkable properties.60–70 To date, uniform TNAs with various pore sizes, lengths, and wall thicknesses have been easily prepared by tailoring the electrochemical conditions. Examples are listed in Table 2 for comparison.

The formation of TNAs goes through three major steps as described below.65

Step I (Formation of the passive layer). 
At the beginning of the anodization, a surface oxide layer forms and TiO2 nanotubes start to form. Gas bubbles are observed during the experiments due to the formation of hydrogen gas (eqn (5)). Ti + 2H2O → TiO2 + 2H2↑(5)


Step II (Breakage of the passive layer). 
Although TiO2 is thermodynamically stable in a pH range of 2–12, the formed TiO2 barrier layer gradually dissolves into the electrolyte by etching of fluoride ions (eqn (6)). TiO2 + 6F− + 4H+ → TiF62− + 2H2O(6)This leads to breakage in the passive oxide layer, and the resulting pits lead to the formation of self-standing nanotube arrays on the metal surface. The self-organized nanotubes formed on the Ti surface result from two chemical reactions, as shown in eqns (5) (field-assisted) and 6 (chemical dissolution).


Step III (Repassivation). 
The growth and dissolution of the oxide layer reach a balance during the steady state anodization stage. At a certain point, when the voltage drop in the horizontal oxide layer direction becomes equal to the applied voltage, the oxide layer growth stops. However, at the TiO2 nanotube bottoms, reactions (5) and (6) will proceed. As a result, the nanotubes will grow into the Ti foils in the vertical direction with continued anodization. When the TiO2 nanotube walls fully develop in the horizontal direction, the current densities drop quickly and stay at a much lower constant value, which represents the steady state anodization condition at the nanotube bottoms.63
Within nanotubular microstructures, vertically oriented TiO2 nanotubes directly grown on the electrically conductive Ti substrate form a natural Schottky-type contact and offer an unidirectional channel for the rapid transport of photogenerated electrons. Many studies have been performed regarding the photocatalytic applications of TNAs toward the degradation of organic compounds.60,61,65 For example, Liu et al.60 studied the photocatalytic degradation of gaseous acetaldehyde by highly ordered TNAs. Increasing the lengths of TNAs within a certain range could significantly improve the degradation rate of acetaldehyde molecules. Compared to a P-25 TiO2 nanoparticulate film with similar thickness and geometric area, the nanotube array did not show obvious superiority in the initial degradation of acetaldehyde. However, in the subsequent degradation, the nanotube array displayed an enhanced photocatalytic activity. The enhanced photocatalytic activity was simply attributed to the special infrastructure of the nanotube array, which is favourable for the diffusion of intermediates and the reduced deactivation of photocatalyst. However, the effect of surface fluorination, which assists the formation of free ˙OH radicals, was not illustrated (eqn (2)).
Recently, Liu et al.61 reported a novel photocatalytic fuel cell (PFC) system for electricity production and wastewater treatment using a high-performance short TiO2 nanotube array (STNA) electrode as photoanode. A variety of model compounds and wastewater can be used as substrates for the PFC system. As a model compound, acetic acid displayed the best cell performance with shortcircuit current density 1.42 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage 1.48 V and maximum power density output 0.67 mWcm−2. The fuel cell system offers a new avenue for energy conversion, effective disposal methodology of organics and a promising technology for wastewater treatment. Furthermore, Dai et al.66c reported the synthesis and enhanced visible-light photoelectrocatalytic activity of p–n junction BiOI/TiO2 nanotube arrays (NTs) (see Fig. 11). This study may provide some new insight into the design and fabrication of advanced photocatalytic materials with p–n heterojunction structures with enhanced photoelectrocatalytic activity. The prepared BiOI/TiO2 NTs could be promising for practical applications in that they can be more readily recycled and reused than conventional powder photocatalysts.

TNAs can also be used as an optical material—“photonic crystals”. Lin et al.62 synthesized periodically structured TNAs films by current-pulse anodizations of Ti foils or films. Fig. 12 shows SEM images of the structured films. Visually, the crystalline films display uniform and monochrome colors in reflected light. The typical optical reflection spectra of the colorful films for samples with different periodic lengths are shown in Fig. 13. Note that the distinct reflection peaks over the entire visible spectrum is due to the Bragg peaks of the samples.

4.2 Titania sheets with {001} high-energy facets
It is generally accepted that surface atomic structure inherently determines the reactivity of heterogeneous catalysts. Often, facets with a higher percentage of undercoordinated atoms are reactive. For instance, {001} facets of anatase TiO2 are more reactive than {101}. Unfortunately, surfaces with high reactivity usually diminish rapidly during the crystal growth process as a result of the minimization of total energy.71,72 Recently, a breakthrough in preparation of anatase TiO2 crystals with exposed {001} facets was achieved by Yang et al.71 Anatase TiO2 microcrystals with 47% {001} facets were synthesized by reversing the relative stability of {101} and {001} facets using HF as morphology-controlling agent (Fig. 14).71 Inspired by this pioneering work, many studies have been conducted on the synthesis of micro- or nanocrystalline TiO2 with a large percentage of reactive facets, such as {001},73,74 {010},75 {100}76 and {110}.77 In general, fluoride was most frequently used as a shape-directing agent, albeit other non-fluoride morphology-controlling agents, such as poly(vinyl pyrrolidone),78 polyvinyl alcohol,72 oleylamine,75 diethylenetriamine,79 and chloride80 were also reported.

Murakami et al.72 reported that TiO2 particles with specific exposed crystal facets showed higher photocatalytic activity than commercial spherical TiO2 particles, suggesting that the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes was inhibited by spatial separation of redox sites due to selective migration of negative electrons and positive holes to specific exposed crystal faces and/or different reactivity of electrons and holes on the specific exposed crystal face (Fig. 15). Similar results were reported by Ohno et al.81 and Yu et al.82 Therefore, the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 could be optimized by tailoring the specific exposed facets. For instance, the photocatalytic activity toward degradation of pollutants on anatase TiO2 with more exposed {001} facets is higher than that of TiO2 with more exposed {101} facets. However, Pan et al.83 reported that clean {001} showed lower reactivity than {101} in photooxidation reactions for ˙OH radical generation and photoreduction reactions for hydrogen evolution. Yu et al.82 examined the impact on photocatalytic activity of TiO2 by combined {001} and {101} facets. The optimal percentage was determined to be ca. 70% {001} and ca. 30% {101} for photocatalytic oxidation decomposition of acetone in air. Why does the prepared TiO2 nanosheet sample with exposed ca. 70% {001} and ca. 30% {101} exhibit the highest photocatalytic activity? This is caused by the following factors. First, previous investigations have shown that for anatase particles, the oxidation reaction mainly occurs on the {001} facets, on the contrary, the reduction reaction mainly occurs on the {101} facets.72,81 This implies that photogenerated holes transferring to {001} facets can enhance oxidation reaction and photogenerated electrons transferring to {101} facets can enhance reduction reaction. Therefore, it is not surprising that with increasing the percentage of {001} facets (from nanoparticles (ca. 10%) to nanosheets (ca. 70%)), the photocatalytic activity first rapidly increases. However, when the percentage of {001} facets exposed is higher than 70%, the photocatalytic activity markedly decreases.82 This is because the lower percentage of {101} facet is not beneficial for the transfer and separation of photogenerated electrons and holes and their synergistic effect on photoactivity. Therefore, it is not difficult to understand that the relative percentage of the exposed {001} and {101} facets is a very important parameter for the effective separation of photogenerated electrons and holes and has a significant influence on the photocatalytic activity.

It should be noted that residual fluoride ions adsorbed on the surface of high-energy TiO2 particles can enhance the photocatalytic activity of TiO2. Therefore, it is important to take into account the fluoride effect when studying the photocatalytic activity among different photocatalysts. Density functional theory calculations and experimental results reveal that HF stabilizes the grown {001} facets at low concentrations, whereas it selectively deters the grown {001} facets at high concentrations.84 From the viewpoint of utilizing solar light, visible-light responsive TiO2 photocatalysts are highly desirable. It has been suggested that non-metal (C85 and N74) doping can enhance the visible-light photocatalytic activity of TiO2 sheets with dominant {001} facets, which were prepared using fluoride as a shape-directing reagent. Table 3 summaries the synthesis, characterization and properties of the typical high-energy TiO2 samples using fluoride as a morphology-controlling agent.86–94

4.3 TiO2 hollow spheres
Although TiO2 nanostructures with a variety of morphologies and textures have been synthesized, TiO2 hollow structures show promising applications in optics, electronics, magnetism, catalysis, and sensors, among other areas.4,95,96
The well-established strategies for the fabrication of TiO2 hollow spheres include conventional hard-templating97,98 and soft-templating (emulsion droplets99 and gas bubbles100). Due to the complexity of the aforementioned templating strategies, one-step self-templated methods based on novel mechanisms, such as inside-out Ostwald ripening, were recently developed to synthesize a wide range of materials with hollow structures.96,101 Ostwald ripening is a spontaneous process, referring to the growth of large precipitates at the expense of smaller precipitates driven by energetics.
Yang et al.95 reported a “one pot” approach to prepare hollow anatase TiO2 nanospheres via Ostwald ripening by hydrothermal treatment of TiF4 solution (Fig. 16). When the reaction time is short, the TiO2 spheres have a solid core (Fig. 16B). The solid TiO2 spheres are comprised of numerous smaller crystallites. Compared to those in the outer surfaces, the crystallites located in the inner cores have high surface energies, because they can also be visualized as a smaller sphere having a higher curvature (i.e., higher surface energies and thus readily dissolved). Therefore, a hollowing effect is more significant for those with a relatively long reaction time (Fig. 16C and D). In fact, Ostwald ripening is influenced by the chemical nature of ionic species present in the solutions. For instance, a hollow process can be dramatically promoted with HF additive.

(A) A schematic illustration of the Ostwald ripening mechanism and two types (i & ii) of formation of polycrystalline hollow microspheres.

The formation mechanism for the self-templating hollow spheres has recently been elaborated by Yu et al.,102 highlighting a stepwise chemically induced self-transformation (CIST) process (Fig. 17). The key is the formation of metastable spherical solid microparticles with uniform size, which ensure the morphological boundary for the subsequent chemical and structural transformation processes (Fig. 17, step 2). The formation of these spherical intermediates is strongly dependent on the aggregation of amorphous nano-sized building blocks, and is therefore sensitive to the nucleation rates of the primary building blocks. Using Ti(SO4)2 and NH4F as precursors (Fig. 18), Yu et al.103 prepared bimodal mesoporous anatase TiO2 hollow microspheres with enhanced photocatalytic activity by fluoride-mediated self-transformation. Fluoride not only induces the outward hollowing of the spherical TiO2 aggregates, but also promotes the crystallization of primary anatase TiO2 nanocrystals. According to the previous studies,37,46,73,102a,104,105 HF can induce both the interior dissolution of particles and subsequent mass transfer from the core to the external surface, probably driven by the following reactions (eqns (7) and (8)). 4H+ + TiO2 (amorphous) + 6F− → TiF62− + 2H2O (dissolution)(7) TiF62− + 2H2O → 4H+ + TiO2 (anatase) + 6F− (recrystallization)(8)Nevertheless, a major drawback of this method is the production of a large fraction of dispersed nanoparticles, and the spherical products were usually ill-shaped and fragile (Fig. 18). This may be due to the etching of HF in acidic solution. Recently, they developed a synthetic approach for the fabrication of well-defined anatase hollow microspheres in the presence of urea, a base catalyst (Fig. 19).

Step 1: production of TiO2 and rapid nucleation of amorphous TiO2 nanoclusters. Step 2: spontaneous aggregation of the incipient amorphous nanoclusters into amorphous spherical solid aggregates. Step 3: the phase transformation from amorphous to anatase on the surface of amorphous solid spheres and formation of a thin crystalline anatase shell around the amorphous microparticles. Steps 4 and 5: preferential dissolution of the amorphous particle interior and concurrent growth of a porous crystalline external shell to produce intact hollow microspheres without significant modifications of the bulk particle morphology.

Hollow TiO2 microspheres composed of anatase TiO2 nanocrystals with exposed high-energy {001} facets was also prepared by fluoride-mediated self-transformation.107 At the beginning of the ripening process, TiO2 microspheres with core–shell structures were observed (Fig. 20). Remarkably, the as-prepared TiO2 hollow spheres display tunable photocatalytic selectivity in decomposing azo dyes in water, favouring decomposition of methyl orange over methylene blue. In contrast, the surface-modified spheres by either NaOH washing or calcinations at 600 °C (to remove surface fluoride) favor decomposition of methylene blue over methyl orange. These results indicate that the surface chemistry of a photocatalyst is important in the adsorption and photocatalytic selectivity toward azo dyes.105

Moreover, rugby-like TiO2 hollow nanoparticles were reported by Lv et al. through a self-transformation mechanism (Fig. 21), where both fluoride ions and H2O2 play important roles in the formation of hollow interiors.108 These anatase TiO2 hollow nanoparticles are mostly 100–150 nm in length (along long-axis) and 80–120 nm in diameter (along short-axis).

5. Phase transformation catalyzed by fluorine ions
In the preparation of an F-doped TiO2 photocatalyst by hydrolysis of titanium tetraisopropoxide in a mixed NH4F–H2O solution, Yu et al.45 found that fluoride ions can suppress the formation of the brookite phase of TiO2. It is suggested that F− ions suppress the crystallization of brookite by adsorbing on to the surfaces of TiO2 particles. Alternatively, F− ions can catalyze the phase transformation from brookite to anatase phase.
Recently, Wang et al.109 reported spontaneous phase and morphology transformations of anodized titania nanotubes induced by water at room temperature. It is suggested that fluoride ions enable the amorphous nanotubes to crystallize into mesoporous anatase nanowires without further treatments. Fig. 22 shows the morphology evolution of anodized titania nanotubes in fluoride-containing water at room temperature.

Furthermore, Yu et al.66a studied the effect of crystallization methods (e.g., calcinations, vapour-thermal and hydrothermal methods) on the morphology and photocatalytic activity of anodized TiO2 nanotube array films (TNAs). They found that post-treatment methods exhibited a great influence on the morphology, crystallization, and photocatalytic activity of TNAs. The presence of a small amount of F− increases the crystallization of anatase TiO2 in a hydrothermal environment. The observed effect of fluorine ions in increasing the crystallization rate under hydrothermal conditions can also be explained according to bridge formation by coordination to the F− ion when it is in low concentrations. Therefore, it is not surprising that the hydrothermal-treated TNAs sample shows the best crystallization due to the presence of water molecules and F−.66a,67
6. Conclusions and perspectives
In summary, fluorinated TiO2 has been extensively investigated recently in relation to doping (TiO2−xFx) or surface fluorination (F–TiO2). It has been found that fluorine doping enhances the crystallization of the anatase TiO2 and its photocatalytic activity. On the other hand, surface fluorination of TiO2 has also been used as a new method of surface modification. Surface fluorination can be readily achieved by a simple ligand exchange reaction between surface hydroxyl groups on TiO2 and fluorine anions (F−) in water. The extent of surface fluorination on TiO2 is significantly dependant on pH, showing a maximum (about 99%) around pH 3–4. Surface-fluorinated TiO2 (F–TiO2) shows enhanced photocatalytic activities for degradation of organic pollutants in water and air. The enhanced photocatalytic activities are due to the following causes. First, the fluorinated surface favors the generation of free OH radicals (not surface-bound ˙OH), which are responsible for the enhanced oxidation. Then, the redox potential of free OH radicals in solution (ca. 2.3 V vs. NHE at pH 7) is larger than that of surface-adsorbed OH radicals on TiO2 (about 1.5–1.7 V vs. NHE at pH 7). Finally, the surface Ti–F groups act as electron-trapping sites to trap the photogenerated electrons by tightly holding trapped electrons due to the strong electronegativity of the fluorine, and thus reducing the recombination rates of photogenerated electrons and holes. Therefore, it is not surprising that the photocatalytic activity of F–TiO2 powders was much higher than those of pure TiO2 and commercial Degussa P25 (P25) powders. However, UV-vis absorption spectra of the naked and fluorinated TiO2 are almost the same, implying that surface fluorination has no influence on the electronic absorption properties, valence band and conduction band of TiO2. This is not difficult to understand because the F element only adsorbs on the surface of TiO2.
It is well known that surface atomic structure significantly influences the reactivity of heterogeneous catalysts. Often, facets with a higher percentage of undercoordinated atoms are more reactive. For example, {001} facets of anatase TiO2 are more reactive than {101}. Unfortunately, {001} facets with high reactivity usually diminish rapidly during the crystal growth process as a result of their high surface energy. Recently, a breakthrough in the preparation of anatase TiO2 micro/nanosheets with highly exposed {001} facets has been achieved using HF as morphology-controlling agent. Furthermore, many investigations have confirmed that TiO2 with more exposed {001} crystal facets showed higher photocatalytic activity in comparison to traditional TiO2 with less exposed {001} crystal facets (ca. 5–10%). Especially, the optimal percentage has been found to be ca. 70% {001} and ca. 30% {101} for photocatalytic oxidation decomposition of acetone in air. However, when the percentage of {001} facets exposed is higher than 70%, the photocatalytic activity markedly decreases. Therefore, the relative percentage of the exposed {001} and {101} facets also is a very important parameter for the effective photocatalytic activity.
The fluoride-induced self-transformation mechanism for the fabrication of hollow anatase TiO2 microspheres has been recently elaborated, highlighting a stepwise chemically induced self-transformation (CIST) process. Fluoride not only induces the outward hollowing of the spherical TiO2 aggregates, but also promotes mass transfer from the core to the external surface and the crystallization of primary anatase TiO2 nanocrystals. Moreover, hollow TiO2 microspheres composed of anatase TiO2 nanocrystals with exposed high-energy {001} facets have also been prepared for the first time by fluoride-mediated self-transformation. Significantly, the prepared TiO2 hollow spheres display tunable photocatalytic selectivity in decomposing azo dyes in water, favouring decomposition of methyl orange over methylene blue. On the contrary, the surface-modified spheres by either NaOH washing or calcinations at 600 °C (to remove surface fluoride) favor decomposition of methylene blue over methyl orange. These results suggest that the surface chemistry of a photocatalyst is important in the adsorption and photocatalytic selectivity toward azo dyes.
Herein, we summarize recent advances in fluorine-mediated modifications of surface and bulk structures of anatase TiO2 and its photoreactivity. Whether fluoride is used as a shape-direction reagent or for surface modifications of TiO2, the adsorption of fluorine ions on the surface TiO2 is crucial. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of modified TiO2 photocatalysts results from combined structure modifications and fluorine doping. Although the effects of fluoride on the structures and photocatalytic activity of TiO2 have been studied for years, many questions still remain open. We believe that fluorine ions will play an indispensable role not only in the design of high performance TiO2 photocatalysts, but in other advanced photocatalytic materials.

 	Fig. 17  The mechanism of fluoride-induced self-transformation for the fabrication of hollow anatase TiO2 microspheres. Step 1: production of TiO2 and rapid nucleation of amorphous TiO2 nanoclusters. Step 2: spontaneous aggregation of the incipient amorphous nanoclusters into amorphous spherical solid aggregates. Step 3: the phase transformation from amorphous to anatase on the surface of amorphous solid spheres and formation of a thin crystalline anatase shell around the amorphous microparticles. Steps 4 and 5: preferential dissolution of the amorphous particle interior and concurrent growth of a porous crystalline external shell to produce intact hollow microspheres without significant modifications of the bulk particle morphology.
