    , Accepted 19th April 2023First published on 19th April 2023AbstractHighly efficient and sustainable energy resources are in great demand today to combat environmental pollution and the energy crisis. In this study, we examined the novel 2D Janus AsTeX (X = Cl, Br and I) monolayers using first-principles calculations and explored their potential energy conversion applications. We demonstrated the thermal, energetic, dynamic and mechanical stability of AsTeX (X = Cl, Br, and I) monolayers. Janus AsTeX (X = Cl, Br and I) monolayers are indirect bandgap semiconductors with high carrier mobilities and excellent visible light optical absorption. Our findings demonstrate that Janus AsTeCl and AsTeBr monolayers exhibit low lattice thermal conductivity and excellent electronic transport properties obtained using semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory, including various scattering mechanisms. Additionally, the redox potential of water is adequately engulfed by the band alignments of the AsTeCl and AsTeBr monolayers. The water splitting process under illumination can proceed spontaneously on the Janus AsTeBr monolayer, while minimal low external potential (ranging from 0.26–0.29 eV) is required to trigger the water splitting process on the Janus AsTeCl monolayer. More than 10% STH efficiency of these monolayers indicates their potential practical applications in the commercial production of hydrogen. Thus, our study demonstrates that these monolayers can show potential applications in energy conversion fields.
1 Introduction
The technologies that produce renewable energies and lessen the energy crisis are widely desired in today's world, where environmental pollution and energy crises are two of the biggest problems. Effective solutions to the energy problems include thermoelectric1,2 and photocatalytic water splitting phenomena.3,4 The thermoelectric phenomenon directly converts untapped heat into electricity,5,6 while photocatalytic water splitting uses solar energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen and transform solar energy into chemical energy.7 The thermoelectric performance of materials is measured by the dimensionless quantity ZT (figure of merit), whereas the efficiency for water splitting depends on several factors, including proper band alignments, carrier migration distance, good optical adsorption, and various active sites.8
Apparently, the thermoelectric performance of materials can be increased in two ways: improving the power factor (PF = S2σ) and decreasing the thermal conductivity κ (=κe + κl). Consequently, various ways have been explored to identify novel materials that quantify low lattice thermal conductivity and high electrical conductivity.9 The thermoelectric performance of two-dimensional (2D) monolayers has been demonstrated to be superior to that of bulk materials owing to the distinct scattering mechanism and the energy dependence of the electronic density of states.10 The thermoelectric performance of graphene, the first-ever 2D material, has been reported to be extremely low (ZT < 0.02 at 300 K) because of the high lattice thermal conductivity (>2000 W m−1 K−1) and poor Seebeck coefficient (<100 μV K−1).11 The most studied transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit low thermoelectric performance, for example, ZT ∼ 0.1 and ZT ∼ 0.7 correspond to MoSe2 and WSe2, respectively, at room temperature, which mainly arises owing to the high value of lattice thermal conductivity.12
Additionally, owing to their exceptional qualities, such as high carrier mobility and good absorption characteristics, 2D materials are incredibly effective photocatalysts for water splitting.13 Because of their high charge transfer efficiency, high optical absorption efficiency, and high stability, TMDs serve as effective photocatalysts for the process of water splitting.14,15 Many TMD monolayers, such as MoS2, MoSe2 (ref. 16) and HfS2,17 have been explored theoretically as water splitting photocatalysts. Furthermore, MXene (transition metal carbides/nitrides) monolayers are also explored as photocatalysts for water splitting.18 Zr2Co2,19 Hf2Co2 (ref. 19) and Sc2Co2 (ref. 20) monolayers act as fascinating photocatalysts owing to the in-build electric field found in the perpendicular direction, which emerges from the non-symmetric structure.21
Because of the unique features compared to more traditional 2D materials, a new derivative of 2D materials known as Janus materials recently gained significant scientific attention.22 Janus materials contain two types of atoms on different surfaces.23 Owing to out-of-plane asymmetry in Janus monolayers, an intrinsic electric field is induced. After the experimental synthesis of Janus graphene,24 Lu and co-workers synthesized Janus MoSSe,25 while Zheng and co-workers synthesized Janus WSSe.26 The experimental synthesis of these monolayers inspired researchers to further explore Janus monolayers. Various Janus monolayers, such as SbTeI,27 In2SSe,28 TiXY (X ≠ Y; X, Y = Cl, Br and I),29 MX2Y (X ≠ Y = S, Se),30 MXY (M = Ge, Sn; X ≠ Y = S, Se),31 WXO (X = S, Se and Te),32 XSn2Y (X ≠ Y = P, As, Sb and Bi)33 and MoSSe,34 are also explored theoretically. Various ternary Janus monolayers, such as WSTe (ZT ∼ 0.74–2.56),35 BiTeBr (ZT ∼ 0.7–1.78),36 BiTeCl (ZT ∼ 0.43–0.75),37 AsSBr (ZT ∼ 0.21–0.91),38 AsSbC3 (ZT ∼ 0.73–0.95),39 PdSeTe (ZT ∼ 0.34–1.86)40 and PtSeTe (ZT ∼ 0.37–1.97),40 show good thermoelectric performance at the temperature range of 300 K–800 K. The intrinsic electric field induced owing to structural asymmetry is favorable to hindering carrier recombination, which enhances the water splitting performance of photocatalysts. Additionally, 2D Janus materials offered different atomic species to execute hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Various 2D Janus monolayers, such as WSSe,41 MoSSe,42 WSeTe43 and PtSSe,44 exhibit high solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency.
Recently, the experimental synthesis of Janus BiTeCl, BiTeBr45 and BiTeI46 monolayers has inspired researchers to explore more analogous Janus monolayers of this family. Theoretical calculations show that 2D BiTeX (X = Cl, Br and I) Janus monolayers are indirect bandgap semiconductors.47 BiTeCl and BiTeI monolayers exhibit a high value of carrier mobilities of the order of 103 cm2 V−1 s−1.48 BiTeCl and BiTeBr monolayers show significant performance in the thermoelectric field with the figure of merit of 0.81 (ref. 37) and 1.75 (ref. 36) at 700 K, respectively. Note that the ZT value of experimentally synthesized bulk BiTeX (X = Cl, Br, and I)49,50 at room temperature ranging from ∼0.1 to ∼0.2. Further BiXY (X = S, Se, Te; Y = F, Cl, Br and I) monolayers show application in the piezoelectric field.47 Very recently arsenic-based ternary Janus monolayers are also explored in the fields of photocatalytic water splitting using the first-principles method.51 Note that the parent materials of these monolayers are Bi2Te3 and As2Te3.52 In this study, we explored the thermoelectric and photocatalytic performance of Janus AsTeX (X = Cl, Br and I) monolayers by employing first-principles method. The thermoelectric performance of these monolayers is evaluated by including various scattering model effects (acoustic scattering, optical scattering, polar optical scattering, impurity scattering and piezoelectric scattering) on the electronic transport properties. The AsTeCl and AsTeBr monolayers show an indirect band gap with suitable band edge positions and the potential to meet the requirements of the redox potentials of water for photocatalysis with more than 10% solar to hydrogen conversion efficiency.
2 Computational details
The quantum ESPRESSO package is used to perform the first-principles density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations.53 For the treatment of electron–ion interactions and exchange–correlation energies, the norm-conserving pseudopotentials with generalized gradient approximation (GGA) are implemented. The k-point grid of 24 × 24 × 1 with a plane-wave cut off of 90 Ry is used for the sampling of the Brillouin zone for both structural relaxation and electronic structure calculations. To eliminate the unphysical forces between the adjacent layers, a vacuum of ∼17 Å is used. The atomic positions and structural parameters are relaxed up to the energy and force convergence of 10−7 eV and 10−6 eV Å−2, respectively. Dipole corrections are employed to account for the intrinsic electric field to calculate the electrostatic potential difference profiles. To demonstrate the dynamic stability, phonon dispersion spectra calculations were carried out using density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) with a q-point mesh of 16 × 16 × 1 and a convergence threshold of 10−18 Ry. The MD simulations were performed using the Nose–Hoover thermostat algorithm at 300 K and 500 K for a total of 5 ps with a time step of 3 fs with a relatively large supercell size of 4 × 4 × 1 and a k-point mesh of 12 × 12 × 1. The electronic properties are calculated using the most precise HSE06 (Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof) hybrid functional.54 To investigate the optical properties involving the excitonic effects, YAMBO code55 integrated with the Quantum ESPRESSO package is used. The plasmon-pole approximation is used to evaluate the quasi-particle energy using the G0W0 method. The Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE) is solved to evaluate the dielectric response of the system involving electron–hole interactions.
The electronic transport properties, which are usually calculated from the constant relaxation time approach, do not include any kind of scattering effects. Hence, the obtained values are not consistent with the experimental results. Therefore, to obtain consistency with experimental results, we employed a more accurate approach that includes the effect of various energy and temperature dependent scattering models in the calculations of electronic transport properties, as implemented in the PAOFLOW 2.0 package.56,57 The method described by Jacoboni et al.58 and recently incorporated in the BoltzTraP framework by Fiorentini et al.59 is used to evaluate the universal relaxation time as follows: (1)where τA, τOp, τPOp, τI and τP terms denote acoustic scattering, optical scattering, polar optical scattering, impurity scattering and piezoelectric scattering, respectively. The details of the terms involved in the above equation are given in the ESI.† The Phono3py code with relaxation time approximation is used to calculate lattice thermal conductivity.60 A highly optimized mesh cutoff of 50 × 50 × 1 is used in the Phono3py code. For 2D monolayers, the thermoelectric parameters are normalized by the Lz/d0 parameter, where Lz is the length of the unit cell in the z direction and d0 is the effective thickness, which is taken as the sum of van der Waals radii of surface atoms (Te, Cl, Br and I) and thickness of monolayers.
The solvation effect in the aqueous solution is considered with the Poisson–Boltzmann implicit solvation model for photocatalytic calculations. The dielectric constant of liquid water is taken as 78.3.61 The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances are evaluated by calculating Gibbs free energy (ΔG) given as follows: ΔG = ΔE + ΔEZPE − TΔS + ΔGU + ΔGpH,(2)where ΔE denotes the adsorption energy, ΔEZPE and TΔS denote the difference in zero point energy and entropy, respectively. ΔGU (=−eU, U is the electrode potential relative to the standard hydrogen electrode) denotes the extra potential of photogenerated charge carriers (electrons and holes). ΔGpH (=KBT × ln10 × pH) denotes the contribution of Gibbs free energy at various pH concentrations. More details on the calculations of Gibbs free energy, thermodynamic oxidation, and reduction potentials are given in ESI.†
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Structure, stability and lattice thermal conductivity
The optimized structure of Janus AsTeX (X = Cl, Br and I) monolayers is presented in Fig. 1. These monolayers possess a trigonal structure with hexagonal unit cells containing three atoms per primitive cell. The crystal structure of Janus AsTeX (X = Cl, Br and I) monolayers is asymmetric in which As atom is sandwiched between Te and X atoms, leading to electrostatic potential differences of 1.46 eV, 1.30 eV and 0.23 eV for Janus AsTeCl, AsTeBr and AsTeI monolayers (Fig. S1, ESI†), respectively. Owing to the difference in the electronegativity of the surface atoms, an electric field is induced from Te to X atoms. The calculated value of the intrinsic electric field is 3.60 eV Å−1, 2.32 eV Å−1 and 0.59 eV Å−1 for AsTeCl, AsTeBr and AsTeI monolayers, respectively. The relaxed lattice constant and other structural parameters (h, α and β) of AsTeX (X = Cl, Br and I) monolayers are listed in Table 1. The comparison of relaxed parameters of AsTeX (X = Cl, Br and I) with their parent monolayer As2Te3 is presented in Table S1, ESI.†

3.1.1 Stability analysis. 
To examine the energetic stability of AsTeX (X = Cl, Br and I) monolayers, we calculate their formation energy as follows: Ef = [EAsTeX − EAs − ETe − EX]/3,(3)where EAsTeX is the total energy of the AsTeX monolayer unit cell. EAs, ETe and EX are the energies of As, Te and X in their bulk stable phases. The calculated value of the formation energy is depicted in Table 1. The negative value of the formation energy of AsTeX (X = Cl Br and I) indicates the energetic stability of these monolayers.
Next, the dynamic stability of AsTeX (X = Cl, Br and I) monolayers is assessed by inspecting the phonon spectra of these monolayers corresponding to high symmetry points in the first Brillouin zone, as shown in Fig. 2. These monolayers are kinetically stable because there are no discernible imaginary modes in the phonon spectra. The phonon spectrum contains 9 modes of vibration: 3 acoustic modes (flexural acoustic mode (ZA), transverse acoustic mode (TA) and longitudinal acoustic mode (LA)) and 6 optical modes.
 Fig. 2  Phonon spectra of AsTeX (X = Cl, Br and I) monolayers. Pink, black and cyan balls in low lying phonon branches along Γ–M direction indicate the flexural acoustic (ZA), transverse acoustic (TA) and longitudinal acoustic (LA) modes, respectively. 
The flexural acoustic mode of AsTeX (X = Cl, Br and I) monolayers exhibits quadratic nature near the Γ point like other 2D materials.62,63 The LA and TA modes of these monolayers indicate linear behavior. The highest vibration frequencies of acoustic modes are calculated to be 85.78 cm−1, 76.43 cm−1 and 73.63 cm−1 for AsTeCl, AsTeBr and AsTeI monolayers, respectively.
The frequency of optical modes decreases from AsTeCl to AsTeI, which is associated with the atomic mass of halogen atoms increasing from Cl to I. According to our computed results, gapless optical and acoustic branches lead to a high scattering process rate and less phonon lifetime, which means that the lattice thermal conductivity of these monolayers is relatively low. In all three Janus monolayers, there is a frequency range where both acoustic and optical modes coexist, which may lead to low thermal conductivity because of the possibility of strong optical–acoustic scattering.
Now, the thermal stability of AsTeX (X = Cl, Brand I) monolayers is demonstrated by AIMD simulations with a larger supercell of 4 × 4 × 1 size for 5000 fs at 300 K and 500 K (Fig. S2, ESI†) with a 3 fs time step. The smaller fluctuations of total energy and temperature around the constant level with time confirm the thermal stability of these monolayers. Our analysis shows that even after 5000 fs, the atomic structures of the Janus monolayers are still robust, as demonstrated in Fig. S2, ESI.†
Subsequently, stress–strain graphs are employed to evaluate the mechanical stability of these monolayers (Fig. S3, ESI†). The uniaxial strain is applied corresponding to the x- and y-directions in the rectangular unit cell. The axis orthogonal to the stress direction is fully relaxed to confirm that the applied strain is uniaxial. The computed maximum ideal strength of the AsTeCl, AsTeBr and AsTeI monolayers is ∼10 GPa, ∼10 GPa and ∼8 GPa at a critical strain limit of 10%, 8% and 10%, respectively, along both the x- and y-directions. The same value of critical strain along the x- and y-directions is due to the symmetric in-plane unit cell structure of Janus AsTeX (X = Cl, Br and I) monolayers. The ideal strength of the AsTeX (X = Cl, Br and I) monolayers is higher than that of the other 2D monolayers, such as BiTeI (5.97 GPa),64 β-Te2S (1.16 GPa)65 and β-Te2Se (7.05 GPa)65 monolayers. The calculated values of Young's modulus for AsTeCl, AsTeBr and AsTeI monolayers are ∼87 GPa, ∼51 GPa and ∼22 GPa, respectively. The lower value of Young's modulus corresponds to higher flexibility. The calculated value of the Poisson ratio for AsTeX (X = Cl, Br and I) monolayers is ∼0.2, which is comparable with other Janus monolayers, such as BiXY (X = S, Se and Te; Y = F, Cl, Br and I) (∼0.2)47 and SbXY (X = Se, Te; Y = Br, I) (∼0.2).66


3.1.2 Lattice thermal conductivity. 
Linear Boltzmann transport equation67 is used to evaluate the lattice thermal conductivity of AsTeX monolayers, i.e. given as follows: κl,i = ∑∑Cpνg,i2(λ,q)τ(λ,q),(4)where κl,i is the lattice thermal conductivity, Cp is the specific heat capacity, vg,i is the group velocity, λ is the phonon mode and q is the wave vector. The lattice thermal conductivity of these monolayers decreases with temperature, which satisfies the temperature dependence relationship κl ∝ 1/T, indicating that lattice thermal conductivity is influenced by Umklapp anharmonic phonon–phonon interactions with temperature.68 The convergence of k-point mesh is done to calculate the lattice thermal conductivity, as given in Fig. S4, ESI.† The calculated lattice thermal conductivity value at room temperature is 0.92 W m−1 K−1, 2.02 W m−1 K−1 and 3.36 W m−1 K−1 for AsTeCl, AsTeBr and AsTeI monolayers, respectively (Fig. 3). The low value of lattice thermal conductivity of AsTeCl compared to AsTeBr and AsTeI suggests that AsTeCl exhibits better thermoelectric performance. The lattice thermal conductivity of AsTeX monolayers is lower than that of PdSeTe (4.02 W m−1 K−1), PdSTe (5.45 W m−1 K−1),40 and Al2SSe (3.8 W m−1 K−1)69 and comparable with those of Janus monolayers, such as BiTeCl (1.46 W m−1 K−1),37 HfSSe (2.2 W m−1 K−1),70 and BiOCl (3 W m−1 K−1).71 Note that the lattice thermal conductivity of the parent compound of AsTeX monolayers, i.e. As2Te3, is 2.76 W m−1 K−1 and 1.68 W m−1 K−1 along the x- and y-directions, respectively.72
 Fig. 3  Lattice thermal conductivity as a function of temperature for AsTeX (X = Cl, Br, I) monolayers. 
We compute phonon group velocity to obtain a deeper insight into lattice thermal conductivity73 as follows: (5)where ω(λ,q) is the phonon frequency. The group velocity contribution of the TA and LA modes of AsTeI is higher than that of AsTeCl and AsTeBr, which indicates the higher lattice thermal conductivity of the AsTeI monolayer (Fig. S5, ESI†). Furthermore, the lattice thermal conductivity is described in terms of a dimensionless quantity, Gruneisen parameter, as follows: (6)
The high value of the Gruneisen parameter is related to the large phonon–phonon scattering, which indicates a lower value of phonon relaxation time. The ZA mode shows a large value of the Gruneisen parameter (Fig. S5, ESI†) caused by the quadratic nature of the band line near the Γ point (Fig. 2). In the case of AsTeI monolayers, the value of the Gruneisen parameter is very small, which results in the very high lattice thermal conductivity of these monolayers. The high value of the Gruneisen parameter and the low value of the group velocity are favourable factors for the lower value of lattice thermal conductivity of the AsTeCl monolayer. Additionally, the phonon lifetime w.r.t. frequency for AsTeX (X = Cl, Br and I) is given in Fig. S6, ESI.† The maximum phonon lifetimes corresponding to AsTeCl, AsTeBr and AsTeI monolayers are ∼6 ps, ∼8 ps and ∼16 ps, respectively. The phonon lifetime indicates that the AsTeI monolayer possesses the highest value of lattice thermal conductivity.

3.2 Electronic structure and optical absorbance
Next, the electronic band structures of Janus AsTeX (X = Cl, Br and I) monolayers are evaluated using various levels of theories. Janus AsTeX monolayers are indirect bandgap semiconductors (Fig. 4 and S7, ESI†) with valence band maximum (VBM) located between Γ and M points and the conduction band minimum (CBM) at Γ point of the Brillouin zone. The calculated values of bandgap using the HSE06 method are 2.32 eV, 2.02 eV and 1.78 eV corresponding to AsTeCl, AsTeBr and AsTeI monolayers, respectively. The bandgap values using various levels of theory are given in Table S2, ESI.† Owing to the heavy atomic mass of the Te atom, we demonstrated the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effect by calculating the band structure using the GGA + SOC level of theory. Owing to splitting in the valence band, there is small reduction (∼0.2 eV) in bandgap value for Janus AsTeX monolayers. Such a small reduction in bandgap values is unlikely to affect the results regarding thermoelectric and photocatalytic applications. Therefore, computationally expensive calculations, including SOC effects, were not considered for further study.

3.2.1 Carrier mobilities. 
After evaluating the electronic structure of AsTeX (X = Cl, Br and I) monolayers, we now calculate the charge carrier mobility to explore the migration capability of charge carriers (electrons and holes) using deformation potential theory:74,75 (7)where μc represents the carrier mobility, m represents the effective mass, C2D represents the elastic modulus and Ed represents the deformation potential; these are evaluated by fitting the curves between energy and strain (Fig. S8, ESI†). Our computed results show that the carrier mobility of electrons is one order higher than that of holes. The values of carrier mobility for these monolayers are isotropic in nature, as listed in Table S3, ESI.† The calculated values of electron (hole) mobility for the AsTeCl, AsTeBr and AsTeI monolayers are ∼700 cm2 V−1 s−1 (∼40 cm2 V−1 s−1), ∼450 cm2 V−1 s−1 (∼50 cm2 V−1 s−1) and ∼300 cm2 V−1 s−1 (∼39 cm2 V−1 s−1), respectively. The higher carrier mobility of electrons arises owing to the smaller effective mass and illustrates their high migration potential. The carrier mobility of these monolayers is higher than that of other Janus monolayers, such as AsSBr (11.77 cm2 V−1 s−1),38 WSSe (229.31 cm2 V−1 s−1)35 and WSTe (222.21 cm2 V−1 s−1).35 Note that the carrier mobility of As2Te3 is calculated to be 183.62 cm2 V−1 s−1.76 To further check the mobility anisotropy, we use a modified longitudinal acoustic phonon limited carrier scattering model. A detailed discussion of carrier mobility calculation using this method is given in ESI.† The calculations indicate that carrier mobility using both formulations showed no significant difference in the results.


3.2.2 Optical absorbance spectra. 
To scrutinize the light-harvesting abilities of AsTeX (X = Cl, Br and I) monolayers, we compute the optical absorbance spectra (A(ω)) using the G0W0 + BSE scheme.77 The optical absorbance spectra of these monolayers are calculated from the imaginary part of the dielectric function78,79 as follows: (8)where L is the measuring parameter for the length of the supercell in the z-direction and ε1 is the imaginary part of the dielectric function. The first prominent optical absorption peaks for these monolayers lie in the visible region (Fig. 5(a)). This indicates that the AsTeX (X = Cl, Br and I) monolayers have a good ability for light harvesting.
 Fig. 5  (a) Optical absorbance spectra of AsTeX (X = Cl, Br and I) monolayers and (b) the same spectra in a narrow energy range. The vertical solid and dotted lines represent the first excitonic peak and quasiparticle gap, respectively. The exciton binding energy is the difference between the first exciton peak and quasiparticle gap. Color code: red-AsTeCl, green-AsTeBr and blue-AsTeI. 
We calculate the excitonic binding energy as follows: Eb = EQP − EOPT,(9)where EQP is the quasi-particle direct bandgap and EOPT is the optical bandgap corresponding to the first peak. The GW band structures of all the monolayers are given in Fig. S9, ESI.† The calculated excitonic binding energies for AsTeCl, AsTeBr and AsTeI monolayers are 0.62 eV, 0.55 eV and 0.49 eV, respectively, as depicted in Fig. 5(b). The excitonic binding energy of these monolayers is smaller than that of other monolayers, such as MgO (2.49 eV), CaO (2.37 eV),80 BeN2 (1.07 eV)81 and MoS2 (1.1 eV)82 monolayers, respectively.

3.3 Thermoelectric properties of AsTeX (X = Cl & Br) monolayers
Next, we calculate the electronic transport properties to investigate the thermoelectric performance of Janus AsTeX (X = Cl, Br, and I) monolayers. The Seebeck coefficient (S), electronic thermal conductivity (κe), electrical conductivity (σ), and power factor (P) play vital roles in computing thermoelectric performance (ZT). These parameters are evaluated using various scattering models described in ESI.† To assess the electronic transport properties incorporating scattering mechanisms, the semi-classical Boltzmann equation is used to describe the variation in distribution function f under an external electric field. A generating tensor α = 0, 1, 2, to describe the transport properties is expressed as follows:83 (10)where τn(k) represents the relaxation time, vi(k) and vi(k) represent the dyadic product, εn(k) represents the band structure and μ represents the chemical potential.
The electronic coefficients S and σ are given as follows: (11) (12)where T represents the temperature.
The variation in the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity w.r.t. temperature is displayed in Fig. 6. The calculated values of the Seebeck coefficient for the AsTeCl, AsTeBr and AsTeI monolayer are 389.70 μV K−1, 219.40 μV K−1 and 35.12 μV K−1 (Table S4, ESI†), respectively, at 500 K temperature. To the best of our knowledge, no study includes the scattering effects in the calculation of electronic transport properties of related 2D materials. Therefore, we also used the constant relaxation time approach (CRTA) to compare with the literature. The calculated values of Seebeck coefficients are 189.1 μV K−1, 149.98 μV K−1 and 71.6 μV K−1, at 500 K corresponding to the maximum values of ZT obtained (Fig. 6(a)). These values are comparable with existing monolayers, such as BiTeCl,37 BiTeBr,36 WSSe and WSTe,35 respectively. The Seebeck coefficients of As2Te3 are 475 μV K−1 and 436 μV K−1, corresponding to the x- and y-directions, respectively.76 The electrical conductivity of AsTeCl, AsTeBr and AsTeI monolayers at 500 K is ∼45 (103/ohm m), 4.64 (103/ohm m) and 1.29 (103/ohm m), respectively (Fig. 6(b)). Using a constant relaxation time approach, the electrical conductivity of AsTeX monolayers is of the order of ∼106 (1/ohm m), which is comparable with that of other Janus monolayers, such as KAgS,84 KAgSe84 and BiTeCl.37
 Fig. 6  The variation in (a) Seebeck coefficient (S) and (b) electrical conductivity of AsTeX (X = Cl, Br and I) monolayers w.r.t. temperature. 
The electronic part of the thermal conductivity is obtained using the Wiedemann–Franz law: κe = LσT,(13)where L is the Lorentz number. The electrical thermal conductivity of AsTeX (X = Cl, Br and I) monolayers lies in the range of 5.81–64.75 W m−1 K−1, while using a constant relaxation time approach, these values are in the range of 0.18–6.89 W m−1 K−1 (Table S5, ESI†), corresponding to the temperature range of 300–500 K. Furthermore, the combined effect of electrical conductivity (σ) and Seebeck coefficient (S) gives the power factor (P) as follows: P = S2σ.(14)
At 500 K, the power factor of AsTeX monolayers lies in the range of 0.0001–0.00073 W m−1 K−2. Using a constant relaxation time approach, the value of the power factor is in the range of 0.003–0.0066 W m−1 K−2 at 500 K, as illustrated in Table S5, ESI.† Detailed discussions of the electronic transport properties of these monolayers using constant relaxation time approximation are provided in the ESI.†

3.3.1 Thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT). 
By the combined effect of lattice thermal conductivity and power factor, we calculate the ZT of 2D AsTeX (X = Cl, Br and I) monolayers, which is given as follows:85,86 (15)where ZT, which is a function of temperature (Fig. 7), indicates good thermoelectric performance with values of 1.25, 0.31 and 0.06 for AsTeCl, AsTeBr and AsTeI monolayers at 500 K, respectively (Fig. 7 and Table S6, ESI†). By employing a constant relaxation time approach, the calculated values of ZT for AsTeCl, AsTeBr and AsTeI monolayers are 3.59, 3.48 and 0.88, respectively (Fig. S11, ESI†). These values of the thermoelectric figure of merit are higher than MXY (M = Pd, Pt; X, Y = S, Se, Te) (0.33–1.97),40 SnSSe (3),87 WSTe (2.56),35 and comparable with KAgS (4.05).84 For comparison purposes, the thermoelectric figure of merit for other 2D monolayers is listed in Table S7, ESI.†

3.4 Photocatalytic properties of AsTeX (X = Cl and Br) monolayers
Next, the photocatalytic properties of AsTeX (X = Cl, Br and I) monolayers are examined. Among these, Janus AsTeCl and AsTeBr monolayers are found to possess suitable band alignments for the photocatalytic water splitting process. Note that the band alignments of the parent monolayer As2Te3 do not match those of photocatalytic water splitting.88 Janus monolayers exhibit different vacuum levels, which help to enable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evaluation reaction (OER), on different surfaces of Janus monolayers (Fig. 8). In the case of AsTeCl and AsTeBr monolayers, the conduction band edge with respect to the Te side and valence band edge with respect to Cl/Br side cover the redox potential to avail adequate activity for OER and HER, respectively, as displayed in Fig. 8(a).
 Fig. 8  (a) Band alignments with respect to the vacuum level of the AsTeCl and AsTeBr monolayers at the HSE06 level of theory. The blue dashed lines represent the water redox potentials at zero pH. The red dashed horizontal lines represent thermodynamic oxidation (Φox) and reduction (Φre) potentials. (b) Proposed photocatalytic pathways and configuration of absorbed species for HER and OER processes. Color code: white sphere = H-atom; red sphere = O-atom, green sphere = As-atom, yellow sphere = X (X = Cl, Br)-atoms and brown sphere = Te-atom. 
The stability of the photocatalyst in an aqueous solution is assessed by calculating the thermodynamic oxidation (Φox) and reduction (Φre) potentials using the method of Chen and Wang.89 The calculated Φre and Φox are shown by red lines in Fig. 8(a). For both monolayers, Φre (Φox) is higher (lower) than the reduction potential of H+/H2 (oxidation potential of O2/H2O) and implies that photogenerated carriers are more likely to reduce and oxidize water molecules than the photocatalyst. Additionally, the feasibility of the adsorption of water molecules on the surface of the AsTeCl and AsTeBr monolayers (Fig. S12, ESI†) is determined by calculating the adsorption energies of water molecules: Eads = E*H2O − E* − EH2O,(16)where E*H2O, E* and EH2O are the total energies of the adsorbed monolayer, pristine monolayer and water molecule, respectively. The calculated values of adsorption energy corresponding to the AsTeCl and AsTeBr monolayers are −0.36 eV and −0.32 eV, respectively. The negative adsorption energy of water molecules on these monolayers indicates their feasibility for water molecule adsorption.

3.4.1 Gibbs free energy profiles. 
We now investigate the Gibbs free energy scheme and mechanisms for half reactions of hydrogen reduction and water oxidation. The calculation details are given in ESI,† and the various quantities, such as zero point energy correction, entropy contribution and total energy, are given in Table S8, ESI.† For the Janus AsTeCl monolayer, the first step, involving the combination of proton and electron with monolayer to form the *H species in the HER mechanism, is the rate limiting step (Fig. 9(a and b)). The potential for photogenerated electrons (Ue) for HER is evaluated to be 1.5 eV at pH = 0, leading to the requirement of only 0.26 eV external potential (ηHER) to trigger the HER process on the AsTeCl monolayer at pH = 0. However, the second step involving the oxidation of *OH to *O species with the release of protons and electrons is the rate limiting step in the OER process (Fig. 9(c and d)). The potential for a photogenerated hole (Uh) for OER is 2.05 eV at pH = 7, leading to the requirement of only 0.29 eV external potential (ηOER) to trigger the OER process on the AsTeCl monolayer at pH = 7. An acidic medium is more favorable for HER, while a neutral medium is more favourable for OER.
 Fig. 9  Proposed reaction pathways for free energy change corresponding to HER (a, b) and OER (c, d) for the AsTeCl monolayer. The violet and green lines represent the circumstances in the absence and presence of light irradiation (at the potential of photogenerated carriers), respectively, while the sky blue lines represent situations with the required external potentials. 
The photogenerated electron (hole) potentials of the Janus AsTeBr monolayer are calculated to be 1.5 eV (1.57 eV) and 1.08 eV (1.98 eV) at pH = 0 and pH = 7, respectively, leading to no requirement of external potential to trigger HER and OER processes at pH = 0 and pH = 7, respectively (Fig. 10). External potentials of 0.48 eV and 0.76 eV are required for HER and OER processes at pH = 7 and pH = 0, respectively. These values of the required external potentials for the OER process are less than those of other 2D materials, such as GaAs (1.39 eV),79 β-Te2S (2.01 eV),65 β-Te2Se (1.30 eV)65 and CuCl (1.53 eV).90 Note that strain engineering91 and defect engineering92 can lower the ηOER and ηHER, respectively.

3.4.2 Solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency. 
In AsTeX (X = Cl and Br) monolayers, the proper band alignments and lower external potentials indicate that these monolayers act as potential candidates for desirable photocatalytic characteristics. The ultimate purpose of photocatalytic water splitting using solar energy is to enhance energy conversion efficiency, which is characterized as solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (STH) depending on the overpotentials of HER and OER. Based on the proper band alignment, the energy conversion efficiency of AsTeX (X = Cl and Br) monolayers is calculated using 100% efficiency of catalytic reaction.93 The computed light absorption (ηabs), carrier utilization (ηCu) and solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (ηSTH) are given in Table S10, ESI.† The ηabs depend upon band gap values, and carrier utilization efficiencies are connected with χ(O2) and χ(H2). The STH efficiency of the 2D monolayers is given as follows: ηSTH = ηabs × ηCu.(17)
Corresponding to the maximum value of solar to hydrogen conversion efficiency (Table S10, ESI†), the carrier utilization efficiency and light absorption efficiencies for Janus AsTeCl (AsTeBr) monolayers are 53.83% (49.33%) and 35.58% (23.75%), respectively. In the case of the Janus monolayer, the presence of an intrinsic electric field that promotes electron and hole migration is also considered in terms of potential difference. The corrected efficiency  is illustrated as follows:65 (18)
The calculated corrected solar-to-hydrogen efficiency values at different pH values w.r.t. to χ(H2) and χ(O2) are given in Table S10, ESI.† The maximum corrected solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiencies for Janus AsTeCl and Janus AsTeBr monolayers are ∼10% and ∼16%, respectively, fulfilling the 10% efficiency criteria for cost-effective commercial production of hydrogen.94 The comparison of maximum corrected solar-to-hydrogen efficiencies of AsTeX Janus with other 2D monolayers is listed in Table S11, ESI.† Note that the absorbed photon conversion efficiency of the WSe2 monolayer is found to be 12% in the experiment of overall water splitting.95

4 Conclusions
In conclusion, 2D Janus AsTeX (X = Cl, Br and I) monolayers were explored owing to their potential applications in the fields of thermoelectric and photocatalytic water splitting. These monolayers exhibit energetic, dynamic, thermal, and mechanical stability. The semiconducting nature of these monolayers is demonstrated by their optoelectronic properties, which include high carrier mobilities and noticeable light absorption abilities. Janus AsTeCl, AsTeBr and AsTeI monolayers exhibit low intrinsic lattice thermal conductivity of 0.92 W m−1 K−1, 2.02 W m−1 K−1 and 3.36 W m−1 K−1, respectively, at room temperature. By the combined results of lattice thermal conductivity and electronic transport properties, the calculated value of ZT for AsTeX (X = Cl, Br and I) monolayers lies in the range of 0.06–1.25 at 500 K, including different scattering models. At different surface vacuum potentials, the redox potential of water for the AsTeCl and AsTeBr monolayers is confined between the band edge positions. HER and OER can proceed spontaneously on the surface of the Janus AsTeBr monolayer under illumination, while a minimal 0.26 eV and 0.29 eV external potential are required to trigger HER and OER processes, respectively, on the Janus AsTeCl monolayer. The maximum solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiencies for Janus AsTeCl and AsTeBr monolayers are obtained as ∼10% and ∼16%, respectively. Thus, the high figure of merit and STH efficiencies of these monolayers indicate their potential applications in energy conversion fields, i.e. thermoelectrics and photocatalytic water splitting.
