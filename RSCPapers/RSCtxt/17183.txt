    , Accepted 14th May 2020First published on 14th May 2020AbstractHerein we demonstrate a new method for the synthesis of methylammonium lead bromide perovskite nanocrystals (MAPbBr3) by using environmentally friendly ionic liquids. The effects of different carboxylate anions in ionic liquids on crystal growth and the properties of MAPbBr3 were investigated. This work paves a new avenue for the sustainable synthesis of perovskite materials by using ionic liquid based green solvents.
In the last decade organo-metallic perovskite materials have attracted enormous attention in the communities of materials science and photovoltaics (PVs) due to their unprecedented achievement in power conversion efficiency with solar cells, which has increased from 3.2 to 25.2% in ten years with perovskite materials made by solution processing methods.1–3 The outstanding performance of perovskite materials in PV devices is ascribed to their unique optical and electrical properties including composition dependent optimal band gaps, strong light absorption, high defect tolerance, and efficient separation of electron–hole pairs.4 Besides PVs, perovskites have also demonstrated potential in other optoelectronic devices such as light emitting diodes (LEDs), photodetectors and transistors, owing to their strong photo-emissive nature.5,6 Compared to thin film based bulk materials, nanocrystals are another important form of perovskite materials owing to the advantageous features of small particles such as stronger photoemission, size-dependent tuneable band gaps which offer efficient light absorption and luminescence in a broader spectral wavelength ranging from violet to near-infrared.7 Perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) in the form of nanowires or nanoplatelets have demonstrated promising performance in applications such as photodetectors, lasers and other optoelectronic devices.8–10 LED devices made from PeNCs have shown exceptional progress with an external quantum efficiency reaching 21.3%.11–16
In all these applications, the synthesis of perovskite materials normally involves the extensive use of hazardous solvents. Traditionally, thin film perovskite materials are synthesized by wet chemical solution processes and PeNCs or QDs can be made by ligand-assisted reprecipitation or hot injection methods which involve the use of noxious solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone in order to dissolve the lead halide salt precursor.17–21 These material synthesis methods are complex and it is difficult to control the material properties; the use of hazardous solvents is also highly unfavourable in industrial fabrication due to their harmful impact on human health and the environment.22 Furthermore, highly coordinating solvents (e.g., DMF and DMSO) used in PeNC synthesis could also lead to the degradation of perovskite NCs by the residual DMF and DMSO solvents in solution.23 To address these issues, efforts have been made to develop a synthetic process with a lower environmentally harmful impact for organo-metal perovskite NCs. For example, less toxic solvents, such as acetonitrile (ACN), were used to dissolve PbI2 powder to synthesize methylammonium lead triiodide perovskite nanocrystals. However not only the complex material synthesis method, but also the low solubility of the lead salt in ACN and the high vapour pressure of flammable ACN make it a challenge for application in large scale material production.24
Ionic liquids (ILs) are a type of material composed of cations and anions with a melting temperature less than 100 °C. The unique properties of low melting temperature and decent solubility in certain materials have enabled ILs a good choice as a green solvent in material synthesis.25 The attempts at using ILs based on methylammonium formate (MAF) for the synthesis of perovskite thin films were reported. Nevertheless, the quality of the synthesized perovskite film was very poor.26,27 Most recently methylammonium acetate was used for the production of perovskite films for solar cells, which showed decent performance.28 To the best of our knowledge, there is no report on the synthesis of perovskite nanocrystals using ionic liquids. Herein, we demonstrated the first facile synthesis of highly luminescent MAPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals by using ionic liquids based on methylammonium carboxylate with different alkyl chains of anions. Highly crystalline MAPbBr3 nanocubes with sizes of 10–20 nm and nanorods with diameters of 80–90 nm were made by controlling the carbon chain of anions of the ILs. The synthesized NCs exhibited bright green photoluminescence with a narrow full width at half maximum of 28 nm and a short radiative lifetime of around 6 ns. This novel method offers a facile, environmentally friendly synthesis pathway for MAPbBr3 NCs with controllable properties for various applications.
A series of methylammonium carboxylate protic ionic liquids with different alkyl chain lengths were synthesized via reactions of methylamine (Brønsted base) with formic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid (Brønsted acid) to form methylammonium formate (MAF), methylammonium propionate (MAP) and methylammonium butyrate (MAB), respectively. All the materials are liquids at room temperature and are thermally stable with no weight loss until the temperature is greater than 90 °C (Fig. S1†). We have conducted nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements for the as-synthesized ionic liquids MAF, MAP and MAP. The 1H NMR spectra of the ionic liquids are shown in Fig. S2.† As can be seen, all the detected protons can be assigned to the corresponding chemical shift of the anions and cations of the ionic liquids. This result indicates the successful synthesis of the ILs. When PbBr2 powder is added to an ionic liquid, we found that all the above ionic liquids reacted with PbBr2 instantaneously at room temperature. Fig. 1a shows a representative example of a sample formed through the reaction between MAP and PbBr2. The white PbBr2 powder changes to yellow colour immediately in the presence of MAP, which emits strong green light under photoexcitation by a UV lamp (365 nm). The instantaneous change in the crystal structure of the PbBr2 powder was also revealed by in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements. In the selected area diffraction pattern of the PbBr2 powder before and after being in contact with MAP, we observed the appearance of a new diffraction pattern which can be assigned to the fingerprint of the MAPbBr3 lattice (Fig. S3†). The yellow powder collected after the reaction can be easily dispersed uniformly in nonpolar solvents like toluene or hexane for further characterisation (inset in Fig. 1b).

The indexed peaks correspond to the perovskite phase. Blue and red bars are standard XRD peaks for PbBr2 and MAPbBr3. 
The UV-visible absorption spectrum of the dispersion solution (Fig. 1b) shows that the material exhibits an absorption peak at ∼526 nm corresponding to a band gap of 2.26 eV. A single strong photoemission peak at ∼530 nm with a narrow FWHM of ∼28 nm is observed in the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of the material (Fig. 1b). The optical properties of the material are consistent with those of MAPbBr3 NCs reported previously.20,29
In order to understand the formation mechanism of the perovskite prepared by using the MAP IL with PbBr2, we monitored the evolution of the crystal structure of the yellow product at different reaction times by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Fig. 1c). As can be seen, after keeping the PbBr2 powder in the MAP liquid for 5 min, new diffraction peaks belonging to the cubic MAPbBr3 perovskite appear. The intensity of the MAPbBr3 peaks keeps on increasing while the intensity of diffraction peaks of PbBr2 decreases with the reaction time. After 2 hours of reaction time, only the MAPbBr3 phase was detected with the primary diffraction peaks at 14.93°, 30.12° and 33.79° corresponding to the (100), (200) and (210) planes of the cubic MAPbBr3 perovskite. We fitted the XRD patterns of the material collected at different reaction times by means of the Rietveld refinement method. We used standard MAPbBr3 (PDF-01-084-9476) and PbBr2 (PDF-04-002-0259) phases as the reference in the fitting. The results show that the percentage of the MAPbBr3 phase in the material was 71.9%, 79.0%, 83.3%, 93.8% and 100% at a reaction time of 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min and 120 min, respectively.
Interestingly, during the phase transformation, an XRD peak at 26.01° (labelled as an unknown peak in Fig. 1c) was detected for the perovskite formed using MAP with a reaction time up to 60 min. After this, the unknown peak gradually decreased in intensity and completely disappeared after 2 h. This peak is probably associated with the formation of an intermediate phase or complex mainly related to the cations of the IL during the formation of perovskite crystals, which is often observed in perovskite phase evolution.30 A similar phase transformation towards the formation of the MAPbBr3 perovskite was also found with MAF and MAB based ionic liquids in the presence of PbBr2 (Fig. S4†). The peak position of the intermediate is located at 27.3° for the MAF-based reaction and 26.4° for the MAB-based reaction. This implies that the intermediate phase formed from PbBr2 and the ILs is also affected by the anions of the ILs. We suppose that the phase involves a (PbBr6)4− octahedron which is caged and isolated by carboxylate bridges, forming an MAPbBr3−x (F/P/B)x intermediate. Chao et al. reported a similar phenomenon where an intermediate phase was formed by the self-assembly of methylammonium acetate (MAAc) with PbI2 during the crystallization of the MAPbI3 thin film in the MAAc IL solvent.28 Furthermore Seo et al. confirmed the formation of complex HCOO−–Pb2+ by using MAF as the additive in the perovskite precursor solution.31 The intermediate phases did not affect the crystal structure and phase purity of the perovskite film, which is similar to our case. However, it can have a significant effect on the nucleation and crystallization of the perovskite material. For example, the intermediate phase between PbI2 and the MAAc ILs effectively hampers the reaction between PbI2 and MAI in the solution.32 Thus, we believe that the anions of formate, propionate and butyrate are involved in the intermediate phases, which in turn affects the crystallization kinetics and ultimately the morphology of the synthesized NCs. For clarity, the perovskites formed with different ionic liquids of MAF, MAP and MAB are named MAPbBr3(MAF), MAPbBr3(MAP) and MAPbBr3(MAB), respectively, in the following study to differentiate the different samples.
Since optical properties and morphology are critical features of perovskite materials, we investigated the effect of the ILs with different anions on the optical properties and morphology of MAPbBr3 formed by MAF, MAP and MAB. It is worth noting that the carbon chain length of the three ILs is of the order MAF < MAP < MAB. As can be seen in Fig. 2a, the brightness of green emission of the MAPbBr3 products made from the three PILs increases in the sequence MAF < MAP < MAB, which is the same trend observed with the increased length of the carbon chain. The different brightness in the photoemission of the MAP and MAB products is also clearly seen in the PL measurement (Fig. 2b), where MAPbBr3(MAB) shows a much stronger PL peak than MAPbBr3(MAP) when the absorbances of the samples were adjusted to almost the same value. The stronger PL peak is assigned to higher radiative recombination. It is worth pointing out that we were not able to measure the PL spectrum of the MAPbBr3(MAF) sample because the MAPbBr3(MAF) solid cannot be dispersed in toluene due to the strong agglomeration of the material (more details are shown below). Furthermore, the different carbon chain of the anion also affects the stability of the product. We have found that MAPbBr3(MAF) slowly dissolves in residual MAF at room temperature due to the presence of N-methylformamide (DMF) and water as a consequence of the condensation reaction of the methylammonium cation with the formate anion of MAF.26 The highly coordinating DMF from the condensation reaction can easily dissolve perovskite materials. In contrast, MAPbBr3 from MAP and MAB appears to be much more stable.

The morphology of the as-synthesized MAPbBr3 powder made from the different ionic liquids was analysed by using a scanning electron microscope (Fig. 2c–e). MAPbBr3(MAF) shows a sticky, compact morphology, while MAPbBr3(MAP) shows a morphology consisting of lots of egg-like small particles. In contrast, MAPbBr3(MAB) shows a distinct morphology composed of small cubic crystals and nanorods. It is known that smaller particles normally benefit the radiative recombination in perovskite NCs.33 This explains the different brightness of the green photoemission of the MAPbBr3 materials obtained by using the three ILs where weak luminescence was observed with MAPbBr3(MAF) and the strongest luminescence with MAPbBr3(MAB).
We further investigated the morphology of the MAPbBr3 material nanocrystals by performing TEM measurements on the dispersion of the as-synthesized solid in toluene. As mentioned before, due to the agglomerated compact material structure, MAPbBr3(MAF) could not be dispersed in solvents for characterisation by TEM and PL analyses. Therefore, we obtained only the TEM images of the MAPbBr3(MAP) and MAPbBr3(MAB) materials which could be easily dispersed in nonpolar solvents like toluene or hexane. Fig. 2f and g show the TEM images of MAPbBr3(MAP) and MAPbBr3(MAB). Apparently, the MAPbBr3(MAP) nanocrystals possess a cubic shape with a size ranging from 10 to 20 nm. High-resolution TEM reveals a highly ordered crystalline lattice with clear lattice fringes (Fig. 2f inset and Fig. S5†) of 0.29 and 0.41 nm, corresponding to the (200) and (110) planes of the cubic MAPbBr3 perovskite, respectively, while MAPbBr3(MAB) exhibits a collection of different shapes of nanocrystals with a nanorod-shape as the most dominant one. The nanorods have a length up to 1μm and a diameter of 80–90 nm. Besides, some small cubic nanocrystals with a similar shape but a larger size compared to the materials of MAPbBr3(MAP) (Fig. S6†), were also observed in MAPbBr3(MAB).
In order to understand the formation mechanism of different morphologies of the MAPbBr3(MAB) nanocrystals, we analysed the TEM results of MAPbBr3(MAB) which were collected at different reaction times. As shown in Fig. S7,† the NCs formed in a short reaction time of 1 min show a very thin layered structure with a rod-like or rectangular shape with a length of around 400 nm and a width of 200–250 nm. The nanorod shape embedded inside the thin layered structure with a diameter of 40 nm and a length of 300 nm can also be clearly seen. This suggests the anisotropic growth of MAPbBr3(MAB) at the beginning of the chemical reaction. Theoretically, the stable cubic structure of MAPbBr3 means that the materials prefer to grow in all directions uniformly. Practically, it is a challenge to make MAPbBr3 nanorods. Petrov et al. reported the synthesis of MAPbBr3 nanowires through anion-exchange with MAPbI3 nanowires, which is tedious.34 The anisotropic growth of the MAPbBr3(MAB) nanocrystals in this work is probably related to the butyrate anion which acts as a structure-direct ligand by anchoring on the surface of the as-synthesized MAPbBr3 as confirmed by the FTIR measurements below. Since the PL peak of the nanocrystals is similar to that of bulk MAPbBr3, it is implied that the lateral dimension of the nanocrystals does not possess quantum confinement characteristics, which require a particle size with at least one dimension less than the Bohn radius of MAPbBr3 (3 nm).35 Interestingly, as the reaction time increases, the MAPbBr3(MAB) material collected after 2 h of reaction time predominantly has a nanorod morphology with a width of 80–90 nm and a length of a few hundred nanometres. When the reaction time is further increased, the nanorod morphology gradually changes to a cubic structure, which is similar to that of MAPbBr3(MAP) but having a larger size of roughly 40–50 nm. The formation of cubic nanocrystals with increasing reaction time could be assigned to the exfoliation of the pre-formed MAPbBr3 nanorods due to the intercalation of ionic molecules, which has been witnessed in the formation of MAPbBr3 nanoplatelets in a previous report.36 After that, no significant morphology changes were observed with an increase of the reaction time. We believe that the morphology change is related to the anions of MAB. We also investigated the morphology evolution of MAPbBr3(MAP). We found that the MAPbBr3(MAP) material collected at 1 min reaction time possesses a nanosphere morphology with a size less than 10 nm, which gradually grows to a cubic structure of 10–20 nm in size (Fig. S8†). This suggests that MAPbBr3(MAP) adopted an isotropic growth mechanism in the material nucleation and growth process.
The different crystal formation mechanism clearly indicates the influence of the anions of the ILs on the crystal shape. Fundamentally, it is a challenge to understand the formation mechanism of the perovskite nanocrystals because of their fast nucleation and growth rate.37 We believe that the formation of perovskite NCs with different morphologies in this work is related to (1) the intercalation ability of the carboxylate ligands; (2) different diffusion dynamics of the ILs; and (3) different densities of the carboxylate ligands on the surface of the as-formed perovskite. The carboxyl groups with different alkyl chains have very different viscosities. The viscosity of MAP is 40% lower than that of MAB and the MAF viscosity is only 10% that of MAB (Fig. S9†). A faster diffusion dynamics of MAP is thus expected, which means that the nucleation of MAPbBr3(MAP) is faster and the anion ligand can quickly leave the surface compared to MAB, thus favouring isotropic growth. When large anions, such as butyrate, with a high concentration anchor on the as-formed MAPbBr3 nanocrystals, the material can achieve anisotropic growth.38 In addition, ionicity is an important factor of ILs, and can influence PeNC synthesis. Ionicity can be quantified as an effective fraction of ions available to participate in conduction.39 On comparing the ionicity of MAF, MAP and MAB, considering that having a shorter alkyl chain can lead to lower viscosity and higher ionicity40 and the odd number of carbon chains tends to have higher ionicity than expected compared to the even number of carbon chains present,25 we expected that the ionicity follows the order MAF > MAP > MAB. It is possible that the higher ionicity of MAP offers more rapid crystallization compared to that of MAB. Furthermore the ionicity of ILs can also affect the surface stabilization and aggregation of nanoparticles through influencing the layer of anionic species on the surface of the particles or the formation of ionic aggregates close to the surface.41–43 Ionicity has a strong correlation with conventional solvent parameters like polarity, conductivity, viscosity and surface tension, thus, the effect of ionicity can also described using these conventional parameters. For example, ionicity can be evaluated from polarity, which is greatly contributed from the dipole moment of dissociated anions in the ILs.44 On the other hand, the dipole moment indicates the affinity of anions toward reactants such as Pb2+ ions, which triggers the phase transformation. Overall, ionicity can be a useful indicator to characterize the ability of ILs in PeNC synthesis and the effect of which will require further study.
In order to confirm the existence of different densities of carboxyl ligands on the surface of the perovskite nanocrystals made from the ILs with different anions, we recorded the Fourier-transform infrared spectra (FTIR) of the synthesized perovskites. As shown in Fig. 3a, the observed vibrational peaks of O–H (939 cm−1) and CO (1714 cm−1 and 1550 cm−1) indicate the existence of carboxylate groups on the surface of all three perovskite materials. In a higher wavenumber region, a broad peak in the range of 2500–3300 cm−1 matches the C–H stretching, which is characteristic of the hydrogen-bonded O–H group of carboxylic acid.45 These observations imply that the carbon chain in the carbonyl group is indeed attached onto the surface of the perovskite NCs after the fast reaction.
 Fig. 3  (a) FTIR spectra of MAPbBr3 NCs prepared using different ionic liquids; (b) illustration of the reaction scheme between ionic liquid MAX and tetragonal PbBr2 to form MAPbBr3 nanocube and nanorod crystals where X acts as surface ligands. 
Based on the FTIR spectra of these three samples, we have also found that the intensity of the vibrational peaks of the surfactants in the N–H, C–H bending and C–H stretching regions follows the order of MAPbBr3(MAB) > MAPbBr3(MAP) > MAPbBr3(MAF). The distinct vibrational peak of the surfactant is the strongest one in MAPbBr3(MAB), while the fingerprint peaks almost disappear in MAPbBr3(MAF), suggesting the different densities of the ligands on the material surface. This low surfactant density can result in the agglomeration of the synthesized NCs and increased surface traps on the NCs, which ultimately lead to poor optical properties of the nanocrystal material.46 This explains the different dispersion abilities of the perovskites in the solvent and their different photoemission properties. Furthermore, the highest density of the long chain butyrate anion of MAB means that some facets of the perovskite nanocrystals were densely protected by the anion ligand from growth, leading to the anisotropic growth of the nanocrystals and formation of nanorods, while the mild density and shorter chain of the propionate ligand of MAP did not provide enough impact to induce the anisotropic growth of the materials. Clearly the surface ligands in this work play several beneficial roles including (1) the prevention of aggregation of the NCs; (2) acting as a structure-direct agent for the growth of MAPbBr3 and (3) the passivation of surface defects of the NCs, just similar to the role of oleic acid which is widely used in PeNC synthesis.47 However, compared to the long chain oleate (18 carbon chain) that is extensively used in PeNCs synthesis, our work shows that the shorter chain carboxylate (three (MAP) or four carbon chain (MAB)) can also work as an effective surface ligand for the growth of perovskite nanocrystals. An additional advantage of the shorter chain carboxyl ligands is that they are more desirable for charge transfer in semiconductor materials compared to the insulating nature of long chain ligands.46,48
In order to demonstrate the universal applicability of this synthesis method, we have also used ILs containing longer alkyl chains made from valeric acid or nonlinear chains such as an aromatic ring from benzoic acid. Methylammonium valerate (MAV) made from valeric acid is a liquid while methylammonium benzoate (MABe) made from benzoic acid is a solid at room temperature. However, MABe becomes liquid at around 60 °C. Similar to MAP and MAB, we found that both MAV and MABe can react with PbBr2 immediately to form MAPbBr3 NCs, which also showed strong photoemission. It should be noted that the reaction with PbBr2 was conducted at 60 °C. The optical properties of MAPbBr3(MAV) and MAPbBr3(MABe) are shown in Fig. S10a and b.† The TEM measurement also reveals cubic perovskite NCs with a size up to 30 nm for MAPbBr3(MAV) while the nanocrystals of MAPbBr3(MABe) have much smaller sizes (10 nm) with an irregular shape (Fig. S10c and d†). FTIR measurements were also conducted to confirm the presence of the carboxylate ligand on the surface of the NCs (Fig. S11†). The synthesized NCs are similar to MAPbBr3 NCs synthesized by using benzylamine and benzoic acid as capping ligands as reported previously.49 These results indicate the universal applicability of this ionic liquid based green synthesis method for the synthesis of MAPbBr3 NCs. They also clearly show the effect of different anions on tuning the size and shape of the perovskite nanocrystals. The underlying mechanism controlling the formation and growth of the perovskite NCs by using MAV and MABe will be investigated in the future.
To test the performance of the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals obtained by using MAP and MAB, we made perovskite thin films by incorporating ink into the MAPbBr3(MAB) NC perovskite by doctor blading (Fig. 4a and Fig. S12a, b†). The SEM result shows the compact, uniform morphology of the film (Fig. S12c†). As shown in Fig. 4a, a patterned perovskite film made from the as-synthesized MAPbBr3(MAB) NCs exhibits strong luminescence under UV excitation (365 nm). It is notable that, the photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) of MAPbBr3(MAB) is much higher than that of MAPbBr3(MAP), suggesting that MAPbBr3(MAB) possesses less trap density, which is probably related to the smaller crystal sizes and the higher density of the carboxyl ligands on the material surface. At a high light intensity of ∼100 mW cm−2, the PLQE is ∼50% for MAPbBr3(MAB) and ∼40% for MAPbBr3(MAP) which are comparable to those of the materials made by using other solvents reported in the literature (Table S1†). The excitation-intensity-induced increase of the PLQE is mainly attributed to the defect filling process under illumination. The time-resolved photoluminescence (TR-PL) spectrum of the thin film, fitted with a biexponential function, shows a very short lifetime of the NCs. The short-lived (τ1) and long-lived (τ2) components of the luminescence decay are 6.02 ns and 42.29 ns for MAPbBr3(MAB), 6.04 ns and 73.38 ns for MAPbBr3(MAP), respectively. The detailed fitting data are listed in Table S2.† The short-lifetime originates from the exciton radiative recombination, which indicates that both materials have effective radiative recombination compared to PeNCs made by using other methods.24,50 The longer PL lifetime (τ2) is associated with a longer charge trapping/detrapping process. The longer τ2 of MAPbBr3(MAP) compared to that of MAPbBr3(MAB) is consistent with its higher surface defects due to the lower density of the surface ligands according to the FTIR results and the PLQE measurements. Interestingly, the film was even stable in water. There was no observable degradation after the material was immersed in water for one hour (Fig. S13†). This is probably due to the hydrophobic nature of the alkyl chains on the surface of the PeNCs.

Furthermore, the ionic liquid based green synthesis method has good reproducibility and is suitable for the large scale fabrication of MAPbBr3 NCs. We scaled-up the synthesis of MAPbBr3 NCs by using 1 g of the PbBr2 precursor with MAB (MAP), which produced 425.5 mg (348.6 mg) of MAPbBr3 NCs in one batch. The obtained NCs show high purity and good optical properties compared to the materials made on a small scale as shown in Fig. S14.†
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated a benign method to synthesize green emissive MAPbBr3 PeNCs by using an environmentally friendly solvent based on ionic liquids. Perovskite NCs with controllable sizes and shapes (nanocubes and nanorods) and subsequently with high photoluminescence have been obtained by controlling the alkyl chain length of the carboxylate group and reaction time. Compared to other synthesis methods of PeNCs, our method has the advantages of facile processing and is environmentally friendly. These two merits are highly desirable and important for the large-scale production of perovskites. Therefore, the demonstrated facile, green material synthesis method paves a new way towards the sustainable industrial production of perovskite materials for various applications.
