    , Accepted 19th March 2023First published on 20th March 2023AbstractHierarchically structured-lanthanide (LnIII)-doped β-NaGdF4 nanoparticles emitting by upconversion (UC), downconversion (DC) and/or downshifting (DS) are currently investigated for potential applications as anti-counterfeiting agents or in energy conversion. Yet, the role of doping concentration, excitation pump power density (Pexc), and LnIII–LnIII separation on the LnIII-to-LnIII energy transfer (ET), luminescence quenching, and emission color tunability need to be further elucidated to boost their luminescence. In light of that, herein, these issues are discussed in nanostructured β-NaGdF4:TbIII,TmIII,YbIII core@shell nanoparticles emitting by UC, DS, and DC. In the NaGdy−xTm0.015Yb0.20TbxF4@NaYF4 compositions, larger TbIII amounts induce stronger TbIII UC while for Pexc lower than 20 W cm−2, both cooperative sensitization upconversion (CSU) and energy transfer upconversion (ETU) mechanisms may occur. On the other hand, for Pexc larger than 50 W cm−2, energy migration upconversion (EMU) dominates the UC. By separating TbIII from TmIII and YbIII in core@shell@NaGdF4 architectures, only the CSU and ETU mechanisms occur, while for Pexc densities larger than 40 W cm−2, saturation of upconversion takes place. Upon 488 nm excitation, TbIII DS and YbIII DC emissions are noticed as well. Thus, this study helps to understand how the proper design of hierarchically structured nanoparticles can control the LnIII-to-LnIII ET mechanisms while their versatile excitation and multi-emission are interesting features for use as anti-counterfeiting agents or in energy conversion.
Introduction
Lanthanide (LnIII)-doped nanoparticles have been studies for a broad range of application, e.g., light-emitting diodes,1 solar cells,2 biosensors,3 temperature probes,4etc. These applications normally take advantage of LnIII intraconfigurational 4fn ⇔ 4fn electronic transitions forbidden by Laporte's selection rule considering the free ions, showing narrow absorption and emission bands displaying long (10−3 s) emitting state lifetime, superior emission color purity, and high emission quantum yields.5,6 Within a broad field of opportunities for choosing desirable crystalline hosts for LnIII ions, NaREF4 (RE = GdIII and/or YIII) is current one of the most explored optical matrix as a result of its low lattice phonon energy (∼400 cm−1), chemical stability, easy synthesis with particle shape and size controls, easy surface modification, as well as low cytotoxicity, enabling the design of phosphors emitting by downshifting (DS), downconversion (DC), and/or upconversion (UC) mechanisms.7,8 The DS phenomenon is classified as a Stokes process, where the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted ones, as shown in Fig. 1a. On the other hand, if the absorbed photon generates two or more emission photons, the phenomenon is commonly called as DC, Fig. 1a. Finally, if two or more absorbed photons generate a single emission photon with higher energy than the absorbed ones, the phenomenon is named UC, which is classified as an anti-Stokes process, Fig. 1a.9

The hexagonal (β) NaREF4 phase is more adequate towards boosting the LnIII luminescence since the LnIII local sites displaying lower symmetry (no inversion center) than the cubic (α) phase favor the intermixing of the 4fn configuration with upper-energy electronic configurations states displaying opposite parity, leading to more relaxed intraconfigurational transitions occurring by the forced electrical dipole mechanism.10 One concern regarding the design of LnIII-doped NaREF4 nanoparticles is the surface chemistry because the doping ions on the surface are exposed to several non-radiative pathways, namely surface defects, lattice strains, energy migration, as well as ligands and solvents displaying high phonon energy (> 1000 cm−1).11 This issue is nowadays surpassed by designing hierarchical core@shell structures in which the shell composition should exhibit low lattice mismatch with the core, such as the NaREF4 itself, since it induces a shell epitaxial growth, leading to an almost homogeneous interface between the core and the shell.12–14 Interestingly, a luminescent active layer can also be included in the particle design aiming not only to avoid surface-related deactivations but also to enhance the luminescence by interfacial energy transfer (ET)15–17 or to avoid quenching of luminescence through cross-relaxation by the spatial confinement of the LnIII ions into different layers.11
Among several applications possibilities of LnIII-doped NaREF4 nanoparticles, in the past decade, efforts have been made on combining different LnIII ions to achieve multicolor and tuneable emission through different excitation channels from the near-ultraviolet (near-UV) to the near-infrared (NIR) spectral windows by UC, DC, and/or DS processes.18 This approach provides exciting opportunities for numerous applications, e.g., the use of photon conversion within the UV-VIS-NIR spectral window for luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) in photovoltaic cells (PCs). That is because the main current PCs (e.g., crystalline Si solar cells) can not efficiently absorb photons in the near-UV and NIR spectral regions coming from the sun, but they display the maximum external quantum efficiency within the 500–1000 nm spectral range.19 Therefore, the use of nanoparticles capable of combining the UC, DS and QC processes to convert NIR and near-UV radiation to the 500–1000 nm spectral range enables the management of photons, probably extending the spectral operation range of such devices.20–22 Moreover, LnIII-doped NaREF4 have also been investigated for application in security inks as anti-counterfeiting agents of banknotes, products, and documents due to their distinguishable spectroscopic fingerprint, long luminescence lifetime, bright emission, and possibility of emission by different excitation channels, which introduce several security layers that are difficult to be reproduced by unauthorized replicas.23–25
Looking for such applications, to achieve visible upconversion in LnIII activators without long-lived intermediate energy states (e.g., EuIII and TbIII), several reports26–28 have been discussed that YbIII can act as a sensitizer ion in a mechanism known as cooperative sensitization upconversion (CSU) since two moles of YbIII can be excited and simultaneously interact with the activator, cooperatively transferring the energy to the activator excited states. Moreover, energy transfer upconversion (ETU) can be achieved from YbIII to ErIII29 or TmIII30 for instance, leading to visible emission. In a modern fashion way, Liu et al.31 reported that efficient upconversion is achieved for EuIII, TbIII, DyIII, or SmIII by a mechanism nowadays named as energy migration upconversion (EMU) since in the NaGdF4:YbIII,TmIII@NaGdF4:LnIII (Ln = Eu, Tb, Dy, or Sm) core@shell structures, the sensitizer YbIII can transfer the excitation energy to TmIII, which transfer the energy to GdIII, followed by energy migration to GdIII ions in the subsequent shell layer through the core@shell interface, and finally, energy transfer to the luminescent active LnIII ions. On the other hand, downconversion emission by quantum cutting (QC) have been studied using the pair TbIII–YbIII in NaREF4, whose combination enables the ET from one excited TbIII to two excited YbIII ions, followed by the NIR YbIII emission matching the band gap of silicon solar cells.32
As aforementioned, although there are many reports regarding the synthesis of hierarchically structured core@shell LnIII-doped NaREF4 nanoparticles for application in energy conversion or as anti-counterfeiting agents, some issues need to be investigated. More specifically, it is of paramount importance to understand what is the role of the composition (i.e., doping concentration and LnIII–LnIII separation) on the LnIII-to-LnIII ET, luminescence quenching, and emission color tunability. Moreover, since both energy conversion and anti-counterfeiting applications require an excitation source (i.e., sun radiation or an artificial light source, respectively), it is essential to understand how the pump power controls the luminescence mechanisms, namely ETU, EMU, and CSU. To deal with such an issues, herein, it is presented the syntheses of hierarchically-structured core@shell TbIII, TmIII, and YbIII-co-doped β-NaGdF4 nanoparticles aiming to combine the UC, DS, and QC processes to obtain multi-emissions processes through different excitation channels, which is interesting for energy conversion and anti-counterfeiting applications. Besides that, by designing different NaGdF4:TmIII,YbIII,TbIII@NaYF4 or NaGdF4:TbIII@ NaGdF4:TmIII,YbIII@NaYF4 compositions, this work shows that the LnIII-to-LnIII ET mechanisms depend on the excitation power, TbIII concentration, and separation of YbIII, TmIII, and TbIII in different layers, providing further understandings for the design of luminescent nanoparticles.
Results
The nanoparticle synthesis and the characterization apparatus are described in S1, ESI.† To understand how the TbIII concentration and excitation pump power control the UC mechanisms as well as the relative TbIII emission intensity in the NaGdy−xTm0.015Yb0.20TbxF4@NaYF4 compositions (X = 0.1; 2; 5; 15 and 20 mol%), a study was carried out by measuring the UC spectra upon 980 nm laser excitation. Fig. 1b shows a powder X-ray diffractogram of the NaGd0.765Tm0.015Yb0.20Tb0.02F4@NaYF4 (2 mol% Tb) nanoparticle, which agrees with the β-NaGdF4 phase. All peaks are shifted toward longer angles compared with the pattern, as expected accordingly to the Bragg's law, suggesting the replacement of GdIII by the smaller dopant ions, causing a lattice contraction and as consequence, decreasing the interplanar distances.33,34 Finally, the TEM image, Fig. 1c, confirms the spheroidal shape of particles, with average size of 8.25 ± 2.15 nm (Fig. 1d) and a NaYF4 layer with thickness of at about 2.0 ± 0.6 nm (Fig. S1, ESI†).
Upon 980 nm excitation, Fig. 2a, the nanoparticle NaGd0.765Tm0.015Yb0.20Tb0.02F4@NaYF4 displays a weak GdIII emission (310 nm) assigned to the 6P7/2 → 8S7/2 transition combined with TmIII emissions within the near-UV-visible spectral windows coming from the 1I6, 1D2, 1G4, 3F2,3 emitting states, and TbIII emissions in the visible window arising from the 5D3 and 5D4 levels. An unexpected weak band close to 525 nm was assigned to the ErIII 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 transition, which arises from traces of ErIII in the Gd2O3 precursor.

Dependence of integrated emission intensities on the Pexc considering (b) 300 to 400 nm, (c) 400 to 450 nm, (d) 450 to 500 nm, and (e) 500 to 760 nm spectral ranges. 
The Pexc dependency of NaGd0.765Tm0.015Yb0.20Tb0.02F4@NaYF4, Fig. 2a, reveals as expected, that the larger is the pump power density, the more intense are the emissions for all LnIII. From this dependence, it is possible to infer on the number of photons (n) involved in the absorption process according to the I ∝ (Pexc)n equation introduced by Pollnau and co-workers,35 where I is the emission integrated intensity. Interestingly, the number of photons involved in the absorption process depends on the Pexc regime used for the excitation, Fig. 2b–e. Upon Pexc lower than 20 W cm−2, the number of photons involved in the absorption process is lower than 5 for all emission, suggesting that the CSU (Fig. 3a) and ETU (Fig. 3b) mechanisms are dominants for the emission process. In such cases, GdIII is not contributing to the energy transfer processes, which suggests that the low Pexc is not enough to populate TmIII upper energy levels such as the 1I6, which may transfer its energy to the GdIII 6P7/2 level.
 Fig. 3  Proposed energy transfer mechanisms involving (a) two photons (cooperative sensitization upconversion – CSU); (b) three photons (energy transfer upconversion – ETU); and (c) five photons (energy migration upconversion – EMU). 
On the other hand, for Pexc larger than 50 W cm−2, a number of 5 absorption photons is obtained for the TbIII 5D4 → 7FJ (J = 5, 4, 3) and 5D3 → 7FJ (J = 6, 5, 4) bands, suggesting that in this case, the energy transfer is mediated by the GdIII 6P7/2 level, through the TmIII absorption up to the 1I6 level, energy transfer to the GdIII 6P7/2 level, and then, energy transfer to the TbIII excited levels, as represented in Fig. 3c, whose mechanism is similar to the EMU process.31 Finally, a value close to 5 absorption photons is observed for almost all other TmIII transitions in this larger Pexc condition.
To explore the dependence of TbIII doping concentration on the upconversion mechanisms, the TbIII doping percentage was changed as 0.1, 2, and 5 mol% in the NaGdx−yTm0.015Yb0.20TbyF4@NaYF4 nanoparticles compositions. The expected TbIII emissions coming from the 5D4 state are observed in the emission spectra upon 980 nm excitation for all concentrations, Fig. S2 (ESI†), along with the TmIII 1G4 → 3F4 transition while the longer is the doping content, the stronger is the relative intensity of the TbIII 5D4 → 7F5 band compared to the TmIII band assigned to the 1G4 → 3F4 transition. Prorok and co-workers36 reported that for NaYF4:TbIII,YbIII and NaYF4:TbIII,YbIII,TmIII systems, TbIII upconversion could only be observed for doping concentrations higher than 5%, which confirms the strategy of using GdIII instead of YIII as an energy transfer mediator towards enhancing the TbIII emission intensity.
The emission intensity dependence on Pexc was also monitored for the NaGdx−yTm0.015Yb0.20TbyF4@NaYF4 systems, as represented in Fig. S3 and S4 (ESI†), confirming that the number of absorption photons depends on both the excitation optical power and the TbIII doping concentration. For the NaGd0.765Tm0.015Yb0.20Tb0.001Y0.019F4@NaYF4 composition (0.1 mol% Tb), the three absorbed photons (Fig. S3, ESI†) suggests that the CSU (Fig. 3a) and ETU (Fig. 3b) mechanisms dominate the upconversion process while for the NaGd0.735Tm0.015Yb0.20Tb0.05F4@NaYF4 nanoparticle (5 mol% Tb, Fig. S4, ESI†), the number of absorbed photons depends on Pexc. In such system, for Pexc larger than 40 W cm−2, the number of absorbed photons is close to 4 for the TbIII transitions: 5D4 → 7F3, 5D4 → 7F4 and 5D4 → 7F5 (Fig. S4, ESI†), suggesting that TmIII and GdIII higher energy levels are populated, contributing to the energy transfer process to TbIII ion. Moreover, for the TmIII transitions, 1G4 → 3F4 and 1G4 → 3H6, the number of absorbed photons is close to 3 (Fig. S4, ESI†), confirming that the ETU mechanism is responsible for this ion upconversion.
The influence of TbIII concentration on the nanoparticle luminescence confirms that this is a paramount parameter to control the energy transfer mechanism responsible for this ion upconversion whereas the higher is the TbIII content in the nanoparticle, the larger is the number of absorbed photons, suggesting that upper energy LnIII levels are populated, which introduces an additional energy transfer route to TbIII ion which is intermediate by GdIII 6P7/2 excited levels.
To understand the role of the separation of activator and sensitizer in different shells on the UC mechanism, the NaGd0.98Tb0.02F4@NaGd0.785Tm0.015Yb0.20F4@NaYF4 (2 mol% Tb) composition was first analyzed. This composition was obtained as β-NaGdF4 phase, as represented in the powder XRD diffractogram, Fig. S5 (ESI†), while TEM images, Fig. 4a, reveal spheroidal-shaped nanoparticle with average size of 13.48 ± 0.08 nm and the shell layer about 3.1 ± 0.4 nm. Moreover, in the high-resolution TEM images (Fig. 4b), diffraction fringes confirm the nanoparticle high crystallinity where the observed interplanar distances match the (1 0 0) and (1 1 0) plans of the β-NaGdF4 phase whereas the interplanar distances noticed in the Fast Fourier Transform – FFT images (Fig. 4c) are also in agreement with the (1 1 0), (1 1 2) and (2 0 0) plans of the same phase. Finally, different contrasts between the nanoparticle core and shell observed in the TEM images, Fig. 4b, confirms the nanoparticle core@shell architecture.

In the Pexc dependent upconversion spectra of the NaGd0.98Tb0.02F4@NaGd0.785Tm0.015Yb0.20F4@NaYF4 nanoparticles, the expected GdIII, TmIII, and TbIII emissions are observed upon 980 nm laser excitation, Fig. 5a. Interestingly, the number of absorption photons decreases in regimes of large Pexc (Fig. 5b–d), which was expected to be close to 5 for this kind of nanoparticle,31 suggesting that a saturation regime35,37 takes place for almost all emission bands observed. Yet, for the TbIII 5D4 → 7FJ (J = 5, 4, 3) emission bands, this saturation effect is not observed, but the number of absorbed photons is close to 3, suggesting that the ETU mechanism (Fig. 2b) is the main contribution for the energy transfer process instead of the expected EMU mechanism (Fig. 2c).
 Fig. 5  (a) Upconversion spectra of β- NaGd0.98Tb0.02F4@NaGd0.785Tm0.015Yb0.20F4@NaYF4 (298 K) at Pexc ranging from 2.8 to 53.4 W cm−2 under 980 nm excitation. Dependence of integrated intensities versus excitation optical power considering (b) 300 to 400 nm, (c) 400 to 500 nm, and (d) 500 to 760 nm spectral ranges. 
This saturation effect in the upconversion emission was already demonstrated for large Pexc by means of rate equations.35,37 This effect arises from the competition between the linear decay and the upconversion emission of intermediary energy levels. Upon high excitation pump powers regime, this linear decay is independent on the pump power, while the upconversion process is strongly dependent on that. As a consequence, upon large Pexc, the upconversion rate becomes dominant over the linear process, making that intermediate states behave as energy transport “paths” that relatively does not consume excitation energy by radiative emission.35,37,38 Therefore, lower slopes of the emission intensity dependence on the pump power generally indicates high upconversion efficiencies.38,39
According to the literature,40–42 in core@shell structures, the luminescence quenching is significantly minimized for activator doping concentrations within 10–20 mol% considering ions lacking intermediary energy levels. Moreover, larger activator doping amounts enhances upconversion intensity than lower doping concentrations (0.2–2 mol%).40–42 To ensure such observations, the β-NaGd0.765Tb0.15F4@NaGd0.785Tm0.015Yb0.20F4@NaYF4 (15 mol% Tb) composition was synthesized as a proof-of-concept (PXRD is shown in Fig. S5 and TEM in Fig. S6, ESI†). By comparing the upconversion emission spectra of the nanoparticles doped with 2 or 15 mol % of TbIII, Fig. S7 (ESI†), the larger doping amount leads to stronger intensities of the emission bands assigned to the TbIII 5D4 → 7F5 and 5D4 → 7F4 transitions compared to the TmIII 1G4 → 3F4 band. Moreover, the number of absorbed photons of the TbIII (15 mol%) doped sample is within 2 to 3, Fig. S8 (ESI†), suggesting that both ETU and CSU are contributing for the energy transfer process up to 40 W cm−2, while for larger regimes, the aforementioned saturation effect takes place as well.
The energy transfer processes from TbIII to YbIII is also investigated in the core@shell@shell nanoparticles, since the TbIII 5D4 → 7F6 absorption takes place at 488 nm, which is almost twice the energy of the YbIII 2F7/2 → 2F5/2 emission, enabling TbIII-to-YbIII energy transfer followed by this ion emission through the QC (DC) mechanism, Fig. S9 (ESI†). For that, the optimum TbIII concentration was verified as follow: β-NaGd0.98Tb0.02F4@NaGd0.785Tm0.015Yb0.20F4@NaYF4 (2 mol% Tb), β-NaGd0.85Tb0.15F4@NaGd0.785Tm0.015Yb0.20F4@NaYF4 (15 mol% Tb), and β-NaGd0.80Tb0.20F4@NaGd0.785Tm0.015Yb0.20F4@NaYF4 (20 mol% Tb).
Emission spectra of these core@shell@shell nanoparticles measured by using a Xe lamp as excitation source (λexc = 488 nm) (Fig. 6 and Fig. S10 and S11, ESI†) reveal a band within the 960–1030 nm (NIR) assigned to the YbIII 2F7/2 → 2F5/2 transitions due to the TbIII-to-YbIII energy transfer and YbIII quantum-cutting emission. Moreover, the emission spectra were also collected upon 488 nm laser excitation (Fig. 6 and Fig. S10 and S11, ESI†), showing the expected YbIII emission at 980 nm along with the TbIII downshifting emission lying within the visible spectral range, coming from the 5D4 emitting state (some TmIII transitions may also overlap TbIII emission).

(b) Emission spectrum in the visible region under laser excitation at 488 nm, (c) quantum-cutting spectra at Pexc ranging from 2.84 to 6.91 W cm−2 under 488 nm laser excitation, and (d) dependence of integrated emission intensities versus Pexc of β-NaGd0.80Tb0.20F4@NaGd0.785Tm0.015Yb0.20F4@NaYF4 (20 mol% Tb) nanoparticles dispersed in cyclohexane at a concentration of 30 mg mL−1. For the calculation of the integrated area in (d), only the spectral region from 975 nm to 1060 nm was considered to avoid any contribution of a possible second-order harmonic peak at 976 nm from the excitation laser. 
The β-NaGdF4@NaYF4 nanoparticle was used as reference to study instrumental interferences that may contribute to the emission spectra of the systems, revealing that upon 488 nm excitation, the emission spectrum (Fig. S12, ESI†) presents a broad band within the visible spectral region due light scattering and another band at 975 nm assigned to the second-order harmonic contribution even though two filters in the optical path were used for the measurements. Therefore, the broad baseline in the visible spectral region of the nanoparticles is due to light scattering while the component at 980 nm was not considered for the analyses of the dependence of the YbIII emission intensity on the Pexc, as discussed in the sequence.
Further analyses of the emission spectra of the β-NaGdy−xTbxF4@NaGd0.785Tm0.015Yb0.20F4@NaYF4 systems reveal that the larger is the doping amount of TbIII, the stronger is the YbIII emission at 1000 nm, Fig. S13 (ESI†). Moreover, from the emission intensity dependence (emission intensity at 1000 nm) on Pexc, a slope around 1 is observed, as also represented in Fig. 6 and Fig. S10 and S11 (ESI†).
Duan and co-workers43,44 discussed on the linear and non-linear dependence of the emission intensity on Pexc in the YbIII quantum cutting emission mediated through TbIII energy transfer. The authors consider a cooperative energy transfer process involving the TbIII 5D4 level as well as a virtual and intermediate metastable states.43,44 If this energy transfer occurs via the virtual TbIII level, the authors showed by rate equations that the energy transfer mechanism corresponds to a second-order non-linear process, rendering a slope of 0.5 in the emission intensity dependence on Pexc. Furthermore, if energy transfer takes place through the TbIII 5D4 level pathway, a linear dependence with slope of 1 is observed.43,44 In this context, these theoretical studies proposed by Dun and co-workers43,44 suggest that the YbIII NIR emission observed in the NaGdy−xTbxF4@NaGd0.785Tm0.015Yb0.20F4@NaYF4 systems was achieved through a linear quantum-cutting mechanism similar to that represented in Fig. S9 (ESI†).
Therefore, the doping concentration, excitation optical power, and separation of LnIII in different shell layers play remarkable roles on the UC mechanism of NaGdF4:LnIII nanoparticles while upon excitation at 488 nm, the TbIII DS emission as well as YbIII QC are also observed. For the core@NaGdF4 nanoparticles (2 mol% TbIII), larger pump power (50 W cm−2) increases the EMU mechanism contribution while the 0.1 mol% TbIII concentration shuts off such pathway. On the other hand, for the core@shell@NaGdF4 nanoparticles, larger pump power (40 W cm−2) induces a UC saturation regime. The introduction of several excitation channels (i.e., 488 nm and 980 nm) that lead to visible emission in these nanoparticles is interesting for application in security inks as anti-counterfeiting agents since it introduces more security layers that are more difficult to be reproduced by fake copies.23–25 Besides that, the NIR emission upon 488 nm excitation could also be interesting for applications as luminescent solar concentrators in PV silicon cells,20–22 although for that, several practical issues in the field have room for investigation, mostly dealing with improving the molar absorptivity, photon conversion efficiency, and YbIII emission intensity, which shows that the strategies discussed here could be applied to help to boost the luminescence of such nanoparticles for the energy conversion field.
Conclusions
Herein, hierarchically structured core@shell nanoparticles constituted by TbIII, TmIII, and YbIII-co-doped β-NaGdF4 were presented in order to provide UC, DS, and QC emissions and understand the dependence of the energy transfer mechanisms on excitation power, TbIII concentration, as well as the hierarchical separation of YbIII, TmIII, and TbIII in different shells. When GdIII, TbIII, TmIII, and YbIII are placed together in the core, the larger the TbIII doping amount, the more intense is the TbIII UC emission; for the 0.1 mol%-Tb-doped sample, only the CSU and ETU UC mechanisms take place while for the 2 mol%-Tb-one, for excitation power densities lower than 20 W cm−2, both CSU and ETU mechanisms are occurring, but for values larger than 50 W cm−2, the EMU mechanism controls the UC process. On the other hand, by separating TbIII from TmIII and YbIII in core@shell@NaYF4 architectures, the 15 mol%-Tb-doping concentration favors the TbIII emission compared to the 2 mol% one, but only the CSU and ETU mechanisms are responsible for the UC emission. Moreover, for excitation power densities larger than 40 W cm−2, a saturation effect in the upconversion emission takes place due to the competition between the linear decay and the upconversion emission of intermediary LnIII energy levels. For these core@shell@shell structures, upon 488 nm excitation, TbIII downshifting emission within the visible spectral range is observed as well as YbIII QC within the NIR spectral window due to a linear TbIII to two YbIII energy transfer whereas the larger the YbIII doping amount, the more intense its emission. Therefore, the strategies employed to understand how the excitation power and TbIII concentration controls the dynamics of luminescence are helpful towards boosting the luminescence in such compositions, whose features can be useful for application in security inks as anti-counterfeiting agents or in energy conversion.
