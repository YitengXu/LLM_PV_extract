    , Accepted 15th January 2021First published on 16th January 2021Abstractα-CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) 2D nanostructures are widely used in solar cells, photocatalysis and photovoltaic applications, mainly because of their high efficiency in the conversion of solar energy. Based on hybrid Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations we consider two aspects, (a) the role of surface termination, and (b) that of quantum size (thickness) of the 2D slabs. We show that the surface termination is a key aspect in determining the electronic properties. For the (001) surface of α-CsPbX3 perovskites there are two possible terminations, with similar stabilities but different positions of the band edges. In general, the band edges of the (110) surfaces, with the X-terminated surface being the most stable one, are lower in energy than the (001) ones. These conclusions are very important for the design of efficient heterostructures for solar light harvesting. Furthermore, the properties of α-CsPbX3 2D nanostructures can be tuned by varying the thickness. We present a general model to predict quantum size effects of α-CsPbX3 from ultrathin films (3–5 atomic layers) to the bulk. Finally, based on calculated electronic properties of CsPbX3 (and TiO2 surfaces), we estimate a type-II alignment in composites such as CsPbX3/TiO2, favourable for electron migration from the perovskite to TiO2. These results can help the rational design of halide perovskite nanostructures for solar energy harvesting, in particular by interfacing 2D materials with specific surfaces and terminations.
1 Introduction
Over the past few years great effort has been dedicated to the study of organic–inorganic halide perovskites of the type ABX3, where A is an organic cation, B an inorganic cation, and X the halogen. These materials display excellent properties when applied in solar cells,1–7 photovoltaics,8–10 light emitting diodes11 and photocatalysis.12,13 They also show high versatility, since it is possible to tune the band gap by modifying the structure and/or the nature of A, B and X. Several studies demonstrated very high efficiencies for solar light conversion, reaching values up to 20%, when the ammonium-based lead halides are used.14–16
Recently, many studies started to focus on pure inorganic halide perovskites, to find alternatives to the state-of-the-art organic–inorganic halide perovskites, and to improve the stability of the devices under working conditions. In this context, of particular interest are perovskites of the type CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I).17,18 These materials may be present in different polymorphs, namely as orthorhombic, tetragonal and cubic.19,20 The cubic crystal structure (α) has become interesting for solar light harvesting purposes,13,21 because α-CsPbX3 structures strongly absorb visible light, with a band gap (Eg) which depends on the nature of the halide.22,23Eg spans from 3.06 eV for α-CsPbCl3,22 to 1.77 eV for α-CsPbI3,20 with Eg = 2.34 eV20 for α-CsPbBr3. The crystal structure of these systems is crucial, since for instance orthorhombic non-perovskite CsPbI3 has a high band gap of 3.01 eV, 1.24 eV higher than the corresponding cubic polymorph.20
CsPbX3 materials are nowadays widely used for applications involving the conversion of solar light,24–29 and they can be combined with oxides, such as TiO2, that on one side protect the perovskites from chemical attack, and on the other provide a type-II alignment of the band edges,30–35 which is suitable for charge-carriers separation upon visible light absorption. For instance, Liu et al. recently showed that when CsPbI3 is combined with TiO2, it is possible to promote the migration of photogenerated electrons reaching up to 99% efficiency;12 Li et al. synthetized CsPbBr3/TiO2 photocatalyst with excellent stability and charge-separation.36 At the same time, CsPbBr3/TiO2 has been successfully applied for CO2 photoreduction,36 as well as CsPbBr3 quantum dots combined with graphene.37 Interestingly, CsPbX3 nanomaterials can also exhibit significant quantum size effects, allowing one to tune the band gap, by modulating their size.23
Several computational efforts have been dedicated to the investigation of the pristine bulk properties, such as structure, band gap and band structure, and to defective systems.38–47 In this work we focus on CsPbX3 2D nanostructures (thin films), whose information is scarce. We study both the role of surface termination and of systems’ size, two essential aspects in determining the properties of perovskite nanomaterials.48 In particular, we will discuss and rationalize: (i) the important role played by surface termination in determining the surfaces’ stability and band edge positions; (ii) the impact of quantum size effects on CsPbX3 nanostructures. Last, we estimate approximately the relative band edge alignments in CsPbX3/TiO2 composites.
Calculations on bulk structures and on the most representative surfaces of CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) 2D nanostructures have been carried out by means of range-separated hybrid Density Functional Theory (DFT), and the data will be compared to experimental data in order to present a general model to predict the size dependence of the band gap of CsPbX3 dots, nanocubes and platelets.49
We will show that the surface termination is a key aspect to rationalize the reactivity, that experimentally is observed with probe molecules or with oxides thin films.50 Furthermore, the results help to rationally design devices with desired properties.51
2 Computational details
Calculation have been performed at the level of Density Functional Theory (DFT) as implemented in the CRYSTAL code.52 Hybrid functionals provide reliable electronic properties of inorganic materials.53–56 For this reason, we adopt the range-separated HSE06 functional,57,58 which has been successfully tested in several cases.53,55 The Gaussian type-orbital basis sets have been used for Cs, Pb, Cl, Br, I atoms and they have been taken from the available CRYSTAL library. In particular, the basis set of Cs has been already applied for the study of perovskites59 and is characterized by a 5s25p66s2 valence shell, while the remaining electrons are described by a suitable pseudopotential.60 Similarly, the basis set of Pb is characterized by 22 valence electrons, and the remaining ones are parametrized by an Effective Core Potential (ECP) accounting for relativistic effects.61,62 For the halogen atoms (Cl, Br, I) we took the TZVP basis set.63,64
The threshold criterion for the convergence of the SCF cycle has been set to 10−6 a.u., and the threshold criteria for the evaluation of the integrals to 10−7, for the exchange pseudo-overlap in the reciprocal space we set to 10−14. In all cases geometry optimizations included both lattice and atomic coordinates relaxation. The reciprocal space has been sampled in the Pack–Monkhorst/Gilat scheme.65–67 The sampling of the reciprocal space has been done by adopting working shrinking factors equal to 10 for bulk and slab calculations. van der Waals dispersions parametrizations have not been included in the calculations according with previous works,18,68 since the addition of dispersion forces as implemented in the D3 scheme69 induces negligible variations, consistent with the fact that CsPbX3 systems are not layered materials. This has also been checked by extensive benchmark calculations on CsPbX3 films, see ESI† for full data. For instance, the maximum band gap deviation between DFT/HSE06-D3 and DFT/HSE06 is 0.1 eV only. The convergence criteria for the geometry optimization were chosen to be 0.00045 and 0.0003 a.u. for maximum and root mean square forces, respectively.
3 Results
3.1 Bulk CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I)
The cubic phase (α) of CsPbCl3,70,71 CsPbBr3,72 CsPbI373 has been fully optimized. The systems are characterized by a perovskite structure, where the Pb ions occupy octahedral sites and the Cs ions dodecahedral ones. The optimized lattice vector a increases moving from Cl to I according to the increasing anion dimensions, with a = 5.644 Å, a = 5.896 Å, and a = 6.185 Å for CsPbCl3, CsPbBr3, and CsPbI3, respectively. The calculated values compare well with the experimental parameters (Table 1), with deviations within 1.7%. It has been reported that the band gap of these materials can be tuned by varying the nature of the halogen and the composition ratio in mixed compounds.22,74 The calculated band gaps (Eg) with HSE06 functionals are in close agreement with the measured ones, with deviations below 0.1 eV, Table 1. In particular, the calculated Eg is 3.02 eV, 2.42 eV, and 1.74 eV for CsPbCl3, CsPbBr3, and CsPbI3 respectively; the experimental values are 3.06 eV (CsPbCl3), 2.34 eV (CsPbBr3), 1.77 eV (CsPbI3). The calculated data compare well with previously reported values at the same level of theory.39 It is important to mention that our calculations don’t include Spin Orbit Coupling (SOC), important for heavy metals, in particular for CsPbI3, and that could result into a change of the calculated band gap.75 However, it was shown that for halide perovskites the DFT band gap obtained without SOC is similar to that obtained by higher level approaches (such as SOC-GW),75–77 an agreement that could be partly fortuitous and due to an error cancellation.77 In our case, the HSE06/DFT calculated gaps compare well to previous SOC-GW data,78Eg = 3.03 eV, 2.30 eV and 1.47 eV for CsPbCl3. Similarly, our calculated reduced effective masses (m*) obtained from the band structure curvature49 are reported in details in Table S1 (ESI†), and they compare well with previous works and they are reasonably in agreement with the available experimental ones, despite the absence of SOC.23,79,80 The Density Of States (DOS) (not reported here) indicates that the major contribution to the Valence Band (VB) comes from the halogen atoms, while the Conduction Band (CB) is dominated by Pb empty states.45,81 CsPbX3 materials are widespread nowadays for solar light harvesting purposes.82,83 This can be understood by their strong visible light absorption, compared with conventional semiconductors such as TiO2 (light absorption ∼5%). Based, on calculated band gaps it is possible to estimate the maximum amount of solar light that in principle can be harvested. Based on a simulated solar spectrum (6000 K), 15%, 28%, and 52% of solar light is expected to be absorbed, by CsPbCl3, CsPbBr3, and CsPbI3, respectively. It is important to remind that the Power Conversion Efficiency of materials is usually by far lower, since other processes need to occur, such as charge transfer. However, the simulation of such processes requires other approaches able to account for excited states and their dynamics.84,85 Experiments reported Power Conversion Efficiencies of CsPbX3 materials ∼10–20%.82,83

3.2 CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) 2D nanostructures
The most stable α-CsPbX3 perovskite surfaces are the (001) and the (110) ones.51,68,86 The (001) surface of a cubic ABX3 perovskite has two possible terminations,31,87 PbX2, Fig. 1a, or CsX, Fig. 1b. The (110) surface of α-ABX3 is polar. However, it is possible to model theoretically non-polar (110) surfaces by accounting for defects, i.e. removing atoms from the surface layers, leading to a net zero dipole moment.88 In this way, the (110) surface of α-ABX3 is symmetric along the non-periodic direction and can be terminated in three different ways, as X, A, or BX, Fig. 2a–c.88 For each system, we investigated the possible terminations of both (001) and (110) surfaces, and simulated slabs of increasing thickness, to provide converged structural and electronic properties with respect to the slab thickness. Each surface model has been built from the optimized bulk structure, and then the 2D-periodic slabs has been fully reoptimized. In the case of the (001) surface we designed slabs with thickness from ∼0.3 nm to ∼5 nm, corresponding to 3 to 19 layers. In the case of the (110) surface, the thickness of the models goes from ∼0.6 to ∼4 nm, ranging from 3 to 21 layers (see Tables S2–S7, ESI† for the calculated structural and electronic properties of the various terminations as a function of the thickness). The lattice parameters rapidly converge to the bulk value, Fig. S1 (ESI†).

 Fig. 2  Side view of CsPbX3(110) slabs. Panels (a), (b) and (c) are for X, Cs, and PbX-terminated surfaces. Red: Cs; grey: Pb; orange: X. 
In all cases the band gap approaches the bulk value by increasing the thickness (Fig. 3), indicating the absence of surface states. The bulk values depend on the nature of the perovskite, as expected. The band gap decreases going from Cl to I.

The impact of surface termination is very significant for the surface energy and the positioning of the Valence Band Maximum (VBM), while the nature of the halide has a secondary role. In particular, the surface energy spans from ∼0.1 J m−2 to ∼0.5 J m−2 as a function of the surface-termination. The VBM may shift by few eV.
These results suggest that the chemical nature of the perovskite affects the structure (lattice vector) and the band gap, while the surface termination can have important implications on the surface stability, reactivity, and band edges alignment of CsPbX3 nanostructures. Furthermore, Fig. 3 and 5 provide also an indication of quantum size effects acting on CsPbX3 nanostructures that will be discussed below.
4 Discussion
4.1 Surface energy
From Fig. 4 one can see that the termination has a crucial role in determining the stability of a surface, while the nature of the halide has a secondary role. In particular, the two terminated (001) surfaces display an almost identical surface energy: in CsPbCl3 the PbCl2-(001) and CsCl-(001) terminations have the same surface energy, γ = 0.16 J m−2; in CsPbBr3 the PbBr2-(001) and CsBr-(001) surfaces have γ = 0.15 J m−2, and γ = 0.13 J m−2, respectively. The surface energy γ of PbI2-(001) and CsI-(001) surfaces in CsPbI3 is also not too different, 0.18 J m−2, and 0.12 J m−2, respectively. These values compare well with the literature.68

Black circles: PbX2-(001); red squares: CsX-(001); green diamonds: X-(110); blue triangles-up: Cs-(110); magenta triangles-down: PbX-(110). Solid shapes: CsPbCl3; striped shapes: CsPbBr3; empty shapes: CsPbI3. 
Moving to the (110) surfaces, Fig. 4b, differently from the previous case the three terminations display significant differences in surface energy. In particular, for the X-terminated surface γ is always lower than the Cs-terminated ones. The PbX-termination is the least stable. The stability of X-terminated (110) surfaces has been observed also in other inorganic α-perovskites.88
Finally, we compare the relative stability of the two most stable (001) and (110) CsPbX3 terminations. In general, we found out these are similar, suggesting that both terminations can be found in real nanostructures, depending on the preparation conditions. For instance, CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets with a (001) surface exposure have been prepared,18 and it has been reported that CsPbI3 nanocrystals can expose both (001) and (110) facets.89,90 In particular, γ of the PbX2-(001) termination is 0.15 J m−2, 0.13 J m−2, 0.18 J m−2 for CsPbCl3, CsPbBr3, and CsPbI3, respectively, to be compared with the X-(110) surfaces, 0.14 J m−2, 0.19 J m−2, 0.17 J m−2 (full data in Tables S2–S7, ESI†). Our results show that these conclusions are valid in general, and apply to CsPbCl3, CsPbBr3, and CsPbI3.
4.2 Band edges
The analysis of the band edges, Fig. 5, indicates that PbX2-surfaces display both Valence Band Maximum (VBM) and Conduction Band Minimum (CBM) which are almost 1 eV lower in energy than the CsX termination (see also Tables S1–S6, ESI†). The calculated values for the PbX2-(001) termination are much closer to the experimental levels, suggesting that this is probably the exposed facet.91 For instance, the calculated VBM of the PbI2-(001) surface in CsPbI3, −4.83 eV, is much closer to the experimental estimate of −5.44 eV91 than the VBM of the CsI-(001) termination, which differs from experiment by more than ∼2 eV. This result is consistent with the PbX2-terminated (001) surface being the exposed face in real nanostructures, as reported for instance for CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets.18 Moving to the (110) surface, we see that the band edges of the Cs-terminated and PbBr-terminated (110) surfaces are significantly higher in energy than those of the most stable X-terminated ones. Notice that the calculated values of the X-terminated surfaces are closer to the experimental values, consistent with the fact that this termination is more stable. In particular, the computed VBM of the I-(110) surface of CsPbI3 deviates by 0.5 eV only from the measured one, while the VBM of the Cs-(110), and PbI-(110) terminations deviate by more than 1 eV.91 Thus, both our surface energy (previous section) and band edges of (110) surfaces suggest that the X-terminated surfaces are those found in experimental samples.

We now consider the band edges of the X-(110) and PbX2-(001) surface terminations of CsPbX3 slabs. Our results indicate that the band edges in X-(110) surfaces are about 0.5 eV lower in energy than those of PbX2-(001). This result could have important implications, since it makes it possible in principle to engineer devices for charge carriers separation, similar to what happens in other systems such as BiVO4 and BiOIO3, where the combination of two different surfaces enhances the electron–hole separation thanks to the proper type II band alignment.92–95
This is particularly relevant for CsPbI3 and CsPbBr3, since moving from Cl to I, the band edges of the (001) and (110) surfaces approach each other. For instance, the VBM of CsPbCl3(110) is 0.77 eV lower in energy than that of the (001) surface; in CsPbBr3 this difference becomes 0.44 eV, and in CsPbI3 it almost disappears, being 0.05 eV only.96
4.3 Quantum confinement
CsPbX3 nanostructures display significant quantum size effects, see Fig. 3, and the band gap increases by decreasing the thickness of the slabs going towards ultrathin films. Such an effect has been observed experimentally both in 2D nanostructures, such as nanoplatelets, and 0D ones, such as nanocubes and dots.18,23,77,97,98 A suitable rationalization of nanostructures’ properties as a function of the system's size may help to predict the impact of quantum confinement. Here we investigate two peculiar instances characterized by 1D- and 3D-confinement (related to 2D and 0D nanostructures, respectively) for which the band gap dependence on the system size has been measured experimentally: CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets and CsPbI3 nanocubes.13,18,99
To do this we have a simplified model where the band gap variation of a nanostructure compared to the bulk, ΔEg = Enanog − E3Dg, can be rationalized as a function of the confinement dimension, as reported in eqn (1).49,100,101 (1)Here, the coefficient k is equal to one for a 3D-dimensional confinement, as in quantum dots or nanocubes, while k = 2 is used for 1D-confinement. The confinement dimension (d) is associated to the radius of a dot, the side of a nanocube, or the thickness of a slab.49,100me* and mh* are the bulk electron and holes effective masses.49,100
The calculated band gaps of the perovskite nanostructures investigated here can be directly compared with the experimental measurement performed on 2D structures corresponding to 1D-quantum confinement,49 as CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets, by evaluating the band gap deviation from the measured bulk band gap.49 Then, the impact of 3D-confinement in CsPbI3 nanocubes can be rationalized in terms of 2D-confinement according to eqn (1), since ΔEg(3D) ∼ 2ΔEg(2D). The validity of this relationship has been recently demonstrated for group III–V 2D and 0D semiconductor nanostructures.49

Fig. 6 reports the experimentally measured band gaps of nanoplatelets of halide perovskites together with the computed band gaps for PbBr2-(001) terminated CsPbBr3 2D nanostructures as a function of the film thickness. The DFT/HSE06 theoretical results nicely matches the observed behaviour of the nanoplatelets, and they are also very close to previous data.18

Fig. 7 shows the observed trend of nanocubes, thus 0D structures, compared with the predicted one based on our DFT/HSE06 simulations and eqn (1).49,100 Even if the two set of data, theory and experiment, refer to quite different ranges of dimensions, since we cannot consider systems of the same size as in the experiment due to the too large supercell, the calculated data extrapolated to bigger systems (dashed red line in Fig. 7) compare very well with the measured ones. To make this trend even more clear, the results are reported both as raw data, band gap versus size, Fig. 7(a), and as the inverse of the square of the dimensions, Fig. 7(b), providing a linearized picture. In this way, the fact that the computed and the measured band gap values follow a straight line becomes apparent, Fig. 7(b).
 Fig. 7  Panel (a) is for band gap of CsPbI3 nanocubes (Exp.) and theoretical estimates from the simulated nanostructures (red squares). Panel (b) reports linearized band gap trend. Dashed red line in panel (b) is a linear regression line obtained from the simulated data. Literature values are taken from ref. 13 and 99. 
This is an important conclusion. Indeed, the results show that by computing 2D nanostructures (slabs) one can accurately predict the behavior of 0D nanostructures, such as dots of nanocubes, thanks to the use of eqn (1). Since 2D nanostructures can be computed much more easily than 0D ones using periodic boundary conditions, this is a powerful tool to predict properties of nanostructured halide perovskites.49
5 Conclusions
We investigated the role of surface termination and system's size in CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) 2D nanostructures by DFT calculations. The structural and electronic properties of (001) and (110) surfaces have been characterized as a function of the system's size. The (001) surface has two main terminations, while the (110) one is characterized by three different terminations. The calculations indicate that the two terminations of (001) surface have similar stability, structural and electronic properties; the main difference is that PbX2-terminated slabs have band edges lower in energy than the CsX-terminated ones. In the case of the (110) surface, X-termination displays the lowest surface energy and the corresponding band edges are in closer agreement with the experiment. X-termination is thus most likely for (110) surfaces in real samples.
Another important outcome of the simulation is that looking at the most stable terminations, the band edges of the (110) slabs are always below in energy than those of the (001) ones, making it possible in principle to engineer devices for charge carriers separation, thus enhancing the electron–hole separation.92–95
The study of the dependence of the electronic properties on the size of the nanostructure allows us to rationalize quantitatively the impact of quantum size effects on the band gap of the system, an aspect that is relevant also for CsPbX3 nanostructures, such as nanoplatelets and nanocubes.
Finally, we mention that the thickness-converged band edges of CsPbX3 and TiO2 can be used to estimate approximately the relative positions of the band edges in composites such as CsPbX3/TiO2,12,36 without explicitly simulating an interface model.93,102,103 Indeed, it was recently shown that the interface effect on the band edges alignment of oxides is usually quite small (0.0–0.2 eV), and that the approach based on a good description of the independent surfaces can lead to reliable conclusions.31,93,102,104–106 However, it must be mentioned that this represents a sort of first order approximation since many important aspects are neglected such as interface effects, charge carriers migration, and kinetics effects.93,102,103 Details of the calculations are reported in ESI† (Sections S5 and S6). By simply considering the separate units, we predict the CsPbX3/TiO2 system to have a type-II alignment, that is suitable for charge-carriers separation, where electrons should be promoted to migrate towards TiO2, thus providing a theoretical validation of the physical reasons behind the high efficiency of these materials reported experimentally.12,36 This result provides a basis for future studies on CsPbX3/TiO2 models, including explicit interface effects.107
