    , Accepted 11th December 2015First published on 11th December 2015AbstractA Cu2O/CuO heterostructure modified with CuS is proposed as a highly promising and stable photocathode for solar hydrogen production. The Cu2O/CuO/CuS heterostructure was synthesized by in situ growth of Cu2O/CuO via simple electrodeposition of Cu film followed by annealing in air, and then the surfaces of the heterostructure were sequentially modified by loading CuS via a successive ion layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) approach. Experimental evidence, including Raman, XANES/EXAFS and XPS spectra, is presented for the interfacial reaction between CuS and Cu2O/CuO. The optimized Cu2O/CuO/CuS photocathode provides a remarkably enhanced photocurrent density of −5.4 mA cm−2 (i.e. >2.5 times than that of bare Cu2O/CuO) at 0 V vs. RHE under standard AM 1.5 light illumination. Due to the bicatalytic effects in suppressing electron–hole recombination, a further increase in photocurrent density to −5.7 mA cm−2 was noticed after decorating the Cu2O/CuO surface with both CuS and Pt. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest performance yet reported for a cocatalyst modified Cu2O/CuO photoelectrode for solar water splitting. More importantly, the Cu2O/CuO heterostructure modified with optimum CuS afforded an impressive solar conversion efficiency of ABPE% = 3.6%, which is a greater than fourfold increase compared to the bare Cu2O/CuO. The stability of the bare Cu2O/CuO photocathode showed about a 44% decrease in initial photocurrent density within 1 h, whereas 85% and 92% of the initial photocurrent was maintained after 1 h when the photocathode was modified with CuS and with both CuS and Pt, respectively. This highly enhanced photoelectrochemical property is attributed to the fast transfer of photogenerated electrons resulting in suppressed electron–hole recombination and the synergistic effect of a heterojunction in light absorption and charge separation. This work demonstrates a facile strategy and potential use of low cost CuS as an efficient cocatalyst for solar hydrogen production that can be applicable in the general field of energy conversion.
1. Introduction
Conventional fossil fuels such as natural gas, coal and petroleum are common energy resources used by society for powering vehicles or electric devices. However, due to their cost, global warming effect and the logical forecast that they are to be exhausted in the future, replacement of fossil fuels with renewable energy resources is highly inescapable. Hydrogen is regarded as a next-generation energy carrier if it is produced from renewable energy sources.1 Hydrogen evolution via photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is one possible and attractive means of hydrogen generation because it requires only semiconductor electrodes, water, and sunlight.2
The hydrogen generation performance of semiconductor materials depends on their optical and electronic properties. To harvest maximum visible light, semiconductors should have an appropriate band gap for sunlight absorption, suitable band positions for water reduction/oxidation, and be stable under the required reaction conditions.1,3 It is reported that many semiconductors, such as TiO2, SrTiO3, WO3, CdS and so on4–9 have shown the ability to generate hydrogen. Compared to them, Cu2O has a relatively narrow band gap (ca. 2.0 eV), which makes it effective at harvesting visible light,10,11 and a sufficiently more negative conduction band edge, making it a more promising and attractive material for solar driven hydrogen production. The maximum absorption of visible light by its band gap provides a theoretical photocurrent of 14.7 mA cm−2 and a light-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 18% based on the AM 1.5 spectrum.12 Furthermore, copper is inexpensive and naturally abundant and thus offers the potential for cost-competitive large-scale Cu2O photoelectrode fabrication.13 However, poor photostability in aqueous electrolytes combined with low photocatalytic efficiency caused by fast recombination of minority carriers still severely limits the practical utilization of Cu2O in solar hydrogen production. Recently, researchers have investigated the possibility of using protective layers14–16 to enhance the stability and PEC performance of Cu2O based photoelectrodes. In fact, from the literature, it would seem to be challenging to achieve photoelectrodes that exhibit enhanced stability and PEC performance at the same time. For instance, although −7.6 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE is the world record activity achieved using a Cu2O photocathode protected with layer-by-layer deposited inorganic oxides and overcoated with Pt cocatalysts,14 the stability of the photocathode is still quite low (i.e. 67% of the initial photocurrent density was decayed after 20 minutes of illumination). Of course, coupling Cu2O with other semiconductors, such as CuO,2,17,18 TiO2, WO319 and BiVO420 with appropriate band alignments can provide an interface for charge transfer, and then improve photoactivity for H2 production. However, without appropriate surface modification by cocatalysts, for instance with Pt,14 RuO2,21 MoS222,23 and so on, Cu2O either protected with protective layers alone or coupled with semiconductors cannot give a high hydrogen evolution activity, which is because of the fast recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs before migration to the surface for reactions. Thus, the presence of cocatalyst not only effectively separates the electron–hole pairs but also provides more proton reduction sites, facilitating proton reduction reactions.24
Even though noble metals and transition metal oxides or sulfides could be efficient cocatalysts for PEC water splitting, their high cost and low availability highly limit their utilization in real applications. Therefore, it is very important to develop highly efficient and low-cost noble-metal free cocatalysts to further facilitate the development of hydrogen evolution. In our recent work, it was shown that CuO can act as an excellent component for fabricating a heterostructure with Cu2O, and that the PEC activity of Cu2O/CuO for H2 evolution is greatly enhanced by loading nickel nanoparticles as a cocatalyst on Cu2O/CuO.2 It is also reported that WS2 and MoS2 play a vital role as a cocatalyst on semiconductors such as CdS25 or Cu2O13 and hydrogen evolution was greatly enhanced. However, tungsten and molybdenum are also rare metals. Copper sulfide (CuS), which is an important photoelectric material with superior performance, is earth-abundant and has drawn intense attention owing to its application in lithium ion batteries, photocatalysts, solar cells and gas sensors.26–29 Therefore, research into CuS as a cocatalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water splitting has extremely vital significance. Recently, independent studies by Shen et al. and Zhang et al. found that a small amount of CuS can improve the visible photocatalytic activity of ZnIn2S4 and Zn0.8Cd0.2S, respectively.30,31 We expect that CuS could also act as a cocatalyst on a Cu2O/CuO heterostructure if an optimum amount is deposited, and to the best of our knowledge the roles of CuS loading and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers on the PEC activity of a Cu2O/CuO heterostructure have not been reported before.
Herein, for the first time we demonstrate the photoelectrochemical generation of H2 using a Cu2O/CuO heterostructure photocathode modified with earth abundant and low cost CuS as a cocatalyst (Cu2O/CuO/CuS), and with both CuS and Pt (Cu2O/CuO/CuS/Pt). We synthesized the Cu2O/CuO heterojunction following our previous report.2 A facile successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method using Cu(NO3)2 and Na2S as precursors was used to deposit CuS nanoparticles on the Cu2O/CuO heterostructure, while Pt loading was performed by a sputtering procedure. At the optimized conditions, the Cu2O/CuO heterostructure modified with CuS and with both CuS and Pt provides a photocurrent density up to −5.4 mA cm−2 and −5.7 mA cm−2 respectively, along with a remarkably enhanced photostability over 1 h. In addition to detailed PEC performance measurements, a thorough pre- and post-characterization of the modified heterostructured photocathode was investigated with respect to its stability. We believe that the method and results shown here point out a convenient and applicable approach for further exploitation of unstable materials for photoelectrochemical hydrogen production.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Methods

2.1.1. Synthesis of Cu2O/CuO. 
All chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade and used without further purification. The Cu2O/CuO heterostructure was fabricated on fluorine-doped tin oxide glass (FTO) by a two step reaction following our previous report.2 Firstly, a pair of FTO substrates, connected to a DC power supply, were immersed into a saturated copper ion solution prepared by dissolving CuSO4·5H2O in deionized water. Cu films were deposited from this solution using a potential of 5 V for 2 minutes. Subsequently, the Cu2O/CuO heterojunction was obtained in situ by annealing the as prepared Cu film in a cubic furnace in air at temperatures of 450 °C for 4 hours.


2.1.2. Deposition of cocatalyst. 
To enhance the kinetics of the water reduction reaction, a stepwise deposition of CuS and Pt cocatalysts was carried out. CuS nanoparticles were deposited on the surface of Cu2O/CuO using a SILAR method. The Cu2O/CuO photoelectrode was immersed into a 5 mM Cu(NO3)2 ethanol solution and subsequently into a 5 mM Na2S ethanol solution at room temperature for about 20 s each. Following each immersion, the photoelectrode was rinsed using pure ethanol to remove loosely adsorbed ions from the precursor. The desired amount of CuS is controlled by repeating the immersion cycle (the number of SILAR cycles) for 3 to 15 complete cycles. For simplicity, the photoelectrode is named as Cu2O/CuO/CuS-x, where x refers the number of CuS SILAR cycles. The deposition of Pt nanoparticles on the Cu2O/CuO/CuS photocathode was done using a sputtering technique for 5 to 40 seconds.

2.2. Structure characterization
The photoelectrodes were characterized using XRD, SEM, DRS UV-Vis, Raman, XPS and XANES/EXAFS. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were acquired using a D2 phaser XRD-300 W, with measurements taken using Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 100 mA. Spectra were obtained with a linear silicon strip ‘Lynx Eye’ detector from 20° to 80° at a scan rate of 3° min−1. The morphology of the electrodes was characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy (EDX JSM 6500F, JEOL). Diffuse reflectance UV-Vis adsorption spectra were obtained using a JASCO (ISV-469) V-560 UV-Vis spectrometer with fine BaSO4 powder as a reference. Raman measurements were performed using a proMaker confocal Raman microscope system as integrated by Protrustech Co., Ltd. A solid state laser operating at λ = 532 nm was used as the excitation source with a laser power of 20 mW to circumvent degradation with 10 s exposure times and 15 accumulations. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed at the wide-range beamline (BL24A) of the NSRRC. The UHV end station of BL24A housed a load-lock sample transfer mechanism, a differentially pumped sputter-ion gun for sample cleaning, and a SPEC Phoibos 150 energy analyzer for XPS. The XPS binding energy scale was referenced to the bulk Au 4f7/2 core level located at 84.00 eV relative to Fermi level. The hard X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) were collected at the beam line BL17C1 of the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC) in Hsinchu, Taiwan. The storage ring of the electronic accelerator can supply an electronic energy of 1.5 GeV and the operation current was 360 mA. A Si double crystal monochromator was used to perform energy scans, of which the parallelism can be adjusted to eliminate high order harmonics. All XAS data were recorded using a fluorescence mode.
2.3. Photoelectrochemical measurement
The photoelectrochemical performance of the electrodes was assessed in a three electrode system using an aqueous solution of 1 M Na2SO4 buffered at pH 5 with potassium phosphate (0.1 M). The three-electrode configuration consists of Ag/AgCl in saturated KCl as a reference electrode, a Pt wire as a counter electrode and the prepared Cu2O/CuO or Cu2O/CuO/CuS as a working electrode. The photoresponse of the synthesized electrode was acquired under chopped illumination from a 300 W xenon lamp equipped with an AM 1.5 filter. The intensity of the light source was calibrated with a Si diode (Newport) to simulate AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2). For all the samples, a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 was used for the current versus potential measurements (LSV). Photocurrent stability tests were performed by measuring the photocurrent produced under chopped light irradiation (on/off cycles of 10 s) at a fixed biasing potential of 0 V vs. RHE. During the PEC tests, the electrolyte was constantly purged with N2 for 30 minutes. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed using an electrochemical impedance analyser with an AC amplitude of 10 mV and a frequency range between 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz. The measured EIS data were obtained at an applied bias of 0 V vs. RHE at 25 °C.
2.4. Photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen measurement
Photostability measurements equipped with hydrogen quantification experiment on bare Cu2O/CuO and Cu2O/CuO/CuS were carried out at an applied potential of 0 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5 irradiation. The evolved gas during the reaction was collected above the water through a tube connected to a separate burette equipped with a septum as a head cap. The change in volume of water displaced by the generated gas was taken as the total volume of evolved gas. The evolved gas sample was taken from the head cap of the burette with a gas-tight syringe and analyzed using a YANGI–LiN gas chromatograph equipped with a PDHID detector. Generated H2 was calculated using a GC calibration curve made from a known concentration of H2 (5% H2/Ar).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Cocatalyst deposition on the photoelectrode
Copper sulfide nanoparticles on Cu2O/CuO were loaded by the successive ion layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) of Cu2O/CuO photoelectrodes in 5 mM ethanolic solutions of copper nitrate and sodium sulfide. Scheme 1 shows the experimental set-up of the manually operated SILAR deposition system. That is, the Cu2O/CuO photoelectrode fabricated by the electrodeposition of Cu film (at 5 V for 2 min) on FTO followed by thermal oxidation in air (at 450 °C for 4 h) was firstly dipped in the cationic precursor solution (Cu(NO3)2) for 20 s, resulting in Cu2+ being adsorbed onto the surface of the Cu2O/CuO film (Scheme 1a). Subsequently, this photoelectrode was immersed in ethanolic solution for 30 s to remove excess adsorbed ions from the precursor (Scheme 1b). Thirdly, the sample was then immersed in the anionic precursor solution (Na2S) for 20 s, resulting in the reaction of sulfide ions (S2−) with the adsorbed Cu2+ on the surface of the Cu2O/CuO photoelectrode (Scheme 1c). In the final step of the SILAR process, the excess and/or unreacted species and the reaction byproduct from the diffusion layer were removed by rinsing the photoelectrode in pure ethanolic solution (Scheme 1e). Therefore, one cycle of CuS deposition on the surface of Cu2O/CuO photoelectrode was accomplished. The built-in amount of CuS can be increased by repeating the immersion cycles. The ionic reaction that could take place during the SILAR process is given as follows: Cu2+ + S2− → CuS(1)

Finally, the Cu2O/CuO/CuS–Pt structure was obtained via sputtering of Pt for the desired time of deposition.
3.2. Photoelectrode characterization using XRD, Raman and SEM
The typical XRD patterns of bare Cu2O/CuO and Cu2O/CuO modified with CuS are shown in Fig. 1a. In all the samples, the emerged XRD diffraction peaks at 36.4 and 38.9° could be indexed to the (111) crystal planes of Cu2O (JCPDS card number 05-0667) and CuO (JCPDS card number 5-661), respectively. This implies that well crystallized cubic Cu2O and monoclinic CuO nanostructures are found in the XRD patterns.2 It is noted that no characteristic diffraction peaks for CuS can be observed in any of the Cu2O/CuO samples modified with CuS for 3 to 15 SILAR deposition cycles. This is because of the low amount of CuS loading. To confront this issue, we also measured XRD patterns of Cu2O/CuO modified with CuS for many SILAR deposition cycles, revealing a small emerging peak at 48.8° which corresponds to the (110) plane of crystalline CuS (JCPDS file no. 65-3931). This indicates the formation of the Cu2O/CuO/CuS nanostructure by the SILAR process.
 Fig. 1  (a) XRD patterns and (b) Raman spectra of bare Cu2O/CuO and CuS on Cu2O/CuO after 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 SILAR cycles. 
The loading of CuS on the surface of Cu2O/CuO under our SILAR procedure was analyzed and good quality Raman spectra were obtained, which are shown in Fig. 1b. In the Raman spectra of bare Cu2O/CuO and Cu2O/CuO modified with three SILAR cycles (Fig. 1b), the weak peak at 218 cm−1 and the relatively strong peak at 286 cm−1 can be assigned to the Cu2O and CuO components of the heterostructure, respectively. Upon increasing the number of SILAR deposition cycles from 3 to 15, it is hard to observe the characteristic peak of Cu2O (218 cm−1), indicating that the SILAR process increases CuS film growth on the surface of the heterostructure and limits the detection of Cu2O components in the bulk. For the Cu2O/CuO photoelectrodes modified with 3 to 15 deposition cycles, the newly emerged peak at 470 cm−1 is attributed to the vibrational (stretching) modes of S–S bonds, confirming the formation of hexagonal CuS, which is also in correlation with the XRD results. The shift to lower Raman shift values (compared to the reference 474 cm−132) may be associated with the vacancies in the CuS lattice, induced during film growth.33
To observe the possible deposition of CuS nanoparticles on the surface of Cu2O/CuO at different numbers of SILAR deposition cycles, we carried out scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements both before and after CuS deposition at various cycles, shown in Fig. 2 and S1.† It is shown in Fig. 2a that the as prepared Cu2O/CuO exhibits highly dense and uniform film features. Once modification with CuS nanoparticles was carried out for three SILAR cycles on the surface of Cu2O/CuO, a few nanoparticles appeared on the surface of Cu2O/CuO. These are clearly indicated by small circles in the SEM image (Fig. S1a†). As the SILAR deposition cycle number increased from 3 to 15 (Fig. 2 and S1†), the amount of CuS particles deposited on the surface of the heterostructure increased rapidly. This implies that the CuS nanoparticles are indeed deposited onto the surface of Cu2O/CuO by the SILAR method. The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrum (Fig. S2†) also confirms that the Cu2O/CuO/CuS sample consists of copper, oxygen and sulfur elements. The presence of Pt in addition to copper, oxygen and sulfur elements in the EDX spectrum of Cu2O/CuO/CuS/Pt sample confirms the deposition of platinum (Fig. S2b†).

3.3. Photoelectrochemical characterization
To investigate the PEC performance of bare Cu2O/CuO, CuS loaded Cu2O/CuO at various SILAR cycles (Cu2O/CuO/CuS-x) and both CuS and Pt loaded Cu2O/CuO photocathodes, linear sweep voltammetry measurements were performed in a 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte (pH 5) under chopped AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination using a conventional three electrode system, with a Cu2O/CuO/CuS-x photocathode, Ag/AgCl electrode and Pt wire as a working electrode, reference electrode, and counter electrode, respectively. A Cu2O/CuO electrode without CuS loading generated a photocurrent density of 2.2 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE (Fig. S3a1†) which is consistent with our earlier report. Compared with the PEC activity of the Cu2O/CuO photoelectrodes modified with CuS or with both CuS and Pt (which will be discussed in this section), this value is much lower. The lower photocurrent density was attributed to the sluggish kinetics and self reduction of the CuO protective layers. However, after deposition of the optimum amount of CuS nanoparticles on the Cu2O/CuO heterostructure, i.e. for nine SILAR cycles, a significantly improved photocurrent density as high as −5.4 mA cm−2 was achieved at the water reduction potential (0 V vs. RHE, Fig. 3a1). This value is more than 2.5 higher than the photocurrent density of the unmodified Cu2O/CuO photoelectrode (−2.2 mA cm−2, Fig. S3a1†). The enhanced performance is primarily due to the good catalytic activity of CuS which facilitates rapid electron transfer to the electrolyte so as to suppress recombination at the surface. Therefore, 9 cycles was found to be the optimal number of cycles for the SILAR deposition of CuS in the present study. The relatively low photocurrent density at lower numbers of SILAR cycles (3 and 6 cycles) is likely due to the CuS deficiency increasing electron–hole recombination.
 Fig. 3  PEC performances and stability measurement of Cu2O/CuO/CuS-9 (a1 and a2), and Cu2O/CuO/CuS-9/Pt (b1 and b2). 
The PEC performances of all the Cu2O/CuO/CuS-x photoelectrodes are presented in Fig. S3† and summarized in Fig. 4. The photocurrent density of the photoelectrodes increases with increasing the number of SILAR cycles and reaches a maximum value (−5.4 mA cm−2) for CuS deposition at nine SILAR cycles. However, fading PEC performance of the Cu2O/CuO/CuS-x photoelectrodes was detected when the number of SILAR deposition cycles increases from 9 to 15, which is likely due to several possible reasons. This is presumably firstly because excessive CuS formed on the surface of Cu2O/CuO may block incoming light to the heterostructure material and thus reduce electron generation. Secondly, the increase of their particle size results in worsening of the catalytic activity of the CuS clusters or disappearance of the surface effect. Thirdly, a higher CuS content may act as a charge recombination center, resulting in a decrease of photocatalytic activity. It is also observed that the photocurrent onset potential of the optimized photocathode (Cu2O/CuO/CuS-9) shifts to a more positive value (∼0.62 V vs. RHE) than the bare Cu2O/CuO (∼0.54 V vs. RHE). The noted shift in onset potential can be attributed to the presence of CuS cocatalyst. This is advantageous in lessening the voltage requirement from the photoanodes and significantly improves water splitting efficiency.

To further enhance the PEC performance of the photoelectrode and to investigate the effect of a dual cocatalyst, we carried out Pt deposition on top of the optimized electrode (Cu2O/CuO/CuS-9) using a sputtering technique. Pt sputtering on the surface of the Cu2O/CuO/CuS-9 electrode was carried out for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 40 seconds. As shown in Fig. 3b1, under chopped illumination, the Cu2O/CuO/CuS nanostructure sputtered with Pt for 10 seconds (Cu2O/CuO/CuS/Pt, the rest of the results are not shown here) gave the maximum photocurrent density, −5.7 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE, i.e. more than 2.6 and 1.1 times higher than the photocurrent density of the Cu2O/CuO and Cu2O/CuO/CuS photoelectrodes, respectively. This indicates that CuS and Pt could also be used as a cocatalyst that provides high PEC performance for hydrogen evolution due to their dual function in facilitating charge transport and suppressing possible electron–hole recombination. The photocurrent density achieved in this study is highly competitive with the highest values reported in literature.
To examine the stability of the photoelectrodes, the time course of the photocurrent density was measured at 0 V vs. RHE under chopped AM 1.5 light illumination. The photocurrent density of the as-prepared Cu2O/CuO heterostructure decreases to about 56% of the initial photocurrent density within 1 h (Fig. 4 and S3a2†). The decrease in the photocurrent probably results from surface degradation by continuous surface charging during illumination. After optimum CuS deposition, the photocurrent density is quite stable and 85% of the initial photocurrent is maintained after 1 h (Fig. 3a2), indicating that CuS has cocatalytic activity on H2 evolution because its redox potential (CuS/Cu2S) is more negative than that of H+/H2. The higher photostability of the CuS modified heterostructure (Cu2O/CuO/CuO-9) is also attributed to the fast transfer of photogenerated electrons and suppressed electron–hole recombination due to interfacial charge transfer (IFCT) initiated by visible light illumination (evidenced by XPS in the later section). Fig. 4 and S3† present a comparison of photostability as a function of the number of CuS deposition cycles and the photocurrent density–time curves for the Cu2O/CuO/CuS-x photoelectrodes, respectively.
The photostability measurements done on Cu2O/CuO modified with both CuS and Pt show a significantly stable photocurrent current density, i.e. 92% of the initial photocurrent is maintained after 1 h (Fig. 3b2), indicating that a dual catalytic effect further enhances the charge transfer and stability of the photoelectrode. As shown in Fig. 4 and S3,† all the Cu2O/CuO/CuS-x photocathodes showed significantly improved photostability, increasing almost linearly with an increase in SILAR deposition of CuS before reaching a high point at 85% with nine cycles of CuS deposition (Cu2O/CuO/CuO-9).
During the photostability measurements, a substantial generation of bubbles accompanied with appreciable cathodic photocurrent density were unequivocally observed on the electrode surface, indicating the evolution of hydrogen gas. To further confirm that the generated cathodic photocurrent density is associated with hydrogen evolution, we carefully carried out quantification of the evolved H2 during the hydrogen experiment using gas chromatography within 20 minutes. After passing 2.8C (Fig. 5a, obtained from integrating the measured current over time) through the Cu2O/CuO/CuS-9 photocathode at 0 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5 illumination, 0.0126 mmol of H2 was detected (Fig. 5b), giving a Faradaic efficiency of 87%. Under the same conditions, the bare Cu2O/CuO photocathode evolved over 3.5 times less H2, i.e. 0.0035 mmol, after passing 1.2C, corresponding to a Faradaic efficiency of 56%. Compared with bare Cu2O/CuO, a 1.5-fold increase in Faradaic efficiency with Cu2O/CuO/CuS-9 indicates the valuable effect of CuS modification on H2 production. That is, the much more efficient H2 production achieved with Cu2O/CuO/CuS-9 photocathode could presumably be due to the active sites provided by the CuS nanoparticles on the surface of Cu2O/CuO and also the good interaction between the materials. The deviation in Faradaic efficiency far from unity for Cu2O/CuO was due to the degradation of the photoelectrode itself whereby the photogenerated electrons are not effectively utilized for hydrogen evolution; this is evidenced by SEM, XPS and XANES studies in the following section and in the SI. However, the slight deviation in Faradaic efficiency from unity with the CuS modified Cu2O/CuO (Cu2O/CuO/CuS-9) photoelectrode was not evidenced due to degradation of the photoelectrode itself, presumably rather due to unwanted backward reactions between H2 and O2,34 or dissolution in the electrolyte solution.35 In spite of these limitations, the current study demonstrates that the Cu2O/CuO photocathode modified with CuS has a better PEC performance with suppression of photocorrosion property compared to the bare Cu2O/CuO photocathode.

(c) Linear sweep voltammetry of Cu2O/CuO and Cu2O/CuO/CuS-9 in a two electrode system (vs. Pt) under simulated one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2). 
The solar conversion efficiency of PEC water splitting was also evaluated by calculating the applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) in a two electrode system according to the following equation:36 (2)where Jph is the photocurrent density obtained under an applied bias Vb between the working and the counter electrodes, 1.23 V is the standard water splitting reaction potential and Ptotal is the incident light intensity (which is 100 mW cm−2). As shown in Fig. 5c, the maximum solar conversion efficiency (ABPE%) for Cu2O/CuO/CuS reaches approximately 3.6% at an applied bias of −0.43 V vs. the Pt counter electrode, while the bare Cu2O/CuO photoelectrode exhibits a maximum efficiency of 0.87% at the same applied bias and measurement conditions. This enhancement is probably attributed to efficient surface charge transfer and suppressed electron–hole recombination by the CuS nanoparticles.
3.4. Charge transfer studies on photocathode
In order to understand the role of CuS, electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) measurements were carried out to investigate the photogenerated charge transfer activity at the photocathode/electrolyte interface. The electrochemical impedance spectra of Cu2O/CuO/CuS-9/Pt, Cu2O/CuO/CuS-9 and bare Cu2O/CuO photoelectrodes under simulated one sun illumination and dark conditions at a potential of 0 V vs. RHE are shown in Fig. 6a. It is known that the semicircular feature of the Nyquist plots (Fig. 6a) at high frequencies is the defining characteristic of the charge transfer process where the diameter of the semicircle is equal to the charge transfer resistance (Rct).37 For all the photocathodes, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) under light was much lower than that in the dark because of the higher charge carrier densities induced by photoexcitation. The Cu2O/CuO/CuS-9 photocathode showed by far a lower Rct value and higher conductivity than the bare Cu2O/CuO whilst competitive enough values were obtained for the both CuS and Pt catalyzed Cu2O/CuO (Cu2O/CuO/CuS-9/Pt) photoelectrode, both in the dark and under illumination. This indicates that incorporating CuS as a cocatalyst could better facilitate electron transfer from the photocathode to the electrolyte, resulting in better PEC performance with better stability. A similar phenomenon, i.e. the activity of CuS as a cocatalyst, was also observed by the linear scan voltammograms recorded for Cu2O/CuO and Cu2O/CuO/CuS-9 in 1 M Na2SO4 solution under dark conditions (Fig. 6b). The photocurrent density versus potential curves show the generation of cathodic currents for the reduction of protons at the modified photoelectrodes. More interestingly, the potential recorded for the reduction of protons at the Cu2O/CuO photoelectrode is −0.37 V (vs. RHE), while the proton reduction potential increased to −0.18 V (vs. RHE) for the Cu2O/CuO/CuS photoelectrode. The considerable decrease of the overpotential of H+ reduction for Cu2O/CuO/CuS can be ascribed to the active sites provided by the CuS nanoparticles on the surface of Cu2O/CuO and also to the good interaction between the two materials, therefore improving the electron transfer rate, facilitating electron–hole separation at the surface, and thus enhancing the kinetics of water reduction.13

3.5. Photostability characterization
To examine the chemical composition of the photocathodes, XANES and EXAFS spectra were taken for the Cu2O/CuO and Cu2O/CuO/CuS-9 samples both before and after PEC testing (see Fig. 7a). Even though the XANES spectra of Cu2O/CuO and Cu2O/CuO/CuS-9 before PEC testing (Fig. 7a) have similar features, the XANES spectrum of the Cu2O/CuO/CuS-9 photoelectrode before PEC testing is slightly shifted to a higher energy (see the inset in Fig. 7a), indicating that oxidation takes place during the incorporation of CuS. On the other hand, after PEC testing the edge position of Cu2O/CuO is shifted by 0.5 eV to a lower position, indicating that the average oxidation state of the Cu species is reduced: this reduction was found to be significantly suppressed after incorporating CuS. The CuS modified photocathode (Cu2O/CuO/CuS-9) showed a relatively smaller shift in edge position (0.2 eV) after PEC testing (in the direction shown in the inset of Fig. 7a) indicating a better stability of the heterojunction, probably due to the oxidation–reduction phenomenon incorporated as a result of the CuS species. A significant morphological surface change (degradation) phenomenon was clearly observed after PEC testing for bare Cu2O/CuO while CuS modified Cu2O/CuO (Cu2O/CuO/CuS-9) did not show any significant change in morphology after 20 minutes of illumination (Fig. S4†).
 Fig. 7  (a) Cu-K-edge XANES spectra of Cu2O/CuO and Cu2O/CuO/CuS-9 both before and after PEC testing; the inset shows an enlargement of the region shown, (b) Cu-K-edge EXAFS spectra of Cu2O/CuO and Cu2O/CuO/CuS-9 both before and after PEC testing in R space. 
In agreement with the XANES spectra, the Fourier transform magnitude Cu-K-edge EXAFS spectra (shown in Fig. 7b) of Cu2O/CuO/CuS-9 both before and after PEC testing are similar, with two main peaks below 3.5 Å. The first peak, located at about 1.6 Å, is due to the Cu–O bonds of Cu2O and is at exactly the same position for both Cu2O/CuO and Cu2O/CuO/CuS-9. This is consistent with our previous work.38 However, modification of the Cu2O/CuO surface with CuS causes a shift in the broad intense peak located at 2.4 Å (black curve in Fig. 7b) that matches well with Cu–Cu bonds to a higher energy position, which implies the incorporation of CuS. More interestingly, the Cu2O/CuO/CuS-9 photoelectrode after PEC testing has the same structural features as before PEC testing, indicating better structural stability, however the intensity of the Cu–Cu bond in Cu2O/CuO after PEC testing increases significantly compared to its initial state, indicating an increase in the crystalline size of Cu2O, probably due to the reduction of the CuO layer. The results displayed here are consistent with the XANES results.
The elemental compositions of Cu2O/CuO and Cu2O/CuO/CuS-9 were further investigated by XPS to examine the changes in chemical status of Cu atoms in the samples. Fig. 8a shows the XPS survey spectra of Cu2O/CuO and Cu2O/CuO/CuS-9. From the Cu2O/CuO sample, only peaks characteristic of Cu 2p, O 1s, and C 1s can be observed, however the Cu2O/CuO/CuS-9 sample has an additional signal that corresponds to S 2p. The weak peaks of C come from adventitious hydrocarbon from the XPS instrument itself. The high-resolution XPS spectra of Cu and S in the 2p region for Cu2O/CuO/CuS-9 are shown in Fig. 8b and c, respectively. The Cu 2p spectrum before PEC testing for 1 hour (Fig. 8b) shows binding energies of Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 peaks at 932.7 and 952.8 eV, respectively, which are typical values for Cu2+ in CuS materials.39,40 Meanwhile, two satellite peaks at 943.2 and 963.6 eV are observed, indicating the paramagnetic chemical state of Cu2+.41 The symmetrical nature of the two Cu 2p XPS peaks and the binding energy peaks observed in the S 2p spectrum at 162.0 and 163.1 eV (Fig. 8c), which are attributed to the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 states respectively, also confirm the formation of CuS.42 However, after PEC testing for 1 h, the two satellite peaks in the Cu 2p XPS spectrum (indicated by circles in Fig. 8b) almost vanish and the binding energies of Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 slightly shift to lower values (932.5 and 952.4 eV), indicating the presence of Cu+. From this result, it is more reasonable to assume that after PEC testing for 1 h, some amount of Cu2+ in CuS is reduced to Cu2S, and it further demonstrates the electron transfer from the surface of Cu2O/CuO to CuS for the partial reduction of CuS to Cu2S. This is consistent with our XAS results.

3.6. Proposed charge transfer mechanism
Considering the band gaps (2.01 eV for Cu2O and 1.54 eV for CuO) and the valence band values (0.63 V vs. RHE for Cu2O and 0.74 V vs. RHE for CuO) reported in our previous study, the band energy level of Cu2O/CuO/CuS in contact with electrolyte solution is illustrated in Scheme 2. Upon illumination of the photoelectrodes with visible light, it is clearly expected that band to band transitions of photogenerated electrons would take place as shown in Scheme 2 (green colored arrow). Because of the potential difference between the conduction and valence bands of Cu2O and CuO, the photogenerated electrons from the conduction band of Cu2O are transferred to the conduction band of CuO and the holes from CuO are transferred to the valence band of Cu2O. However, we achieved a limited photocurrent density with the bare Cu2O/CuO electrode, probably due to the sluggish kinetics in injecting photogenerated electrons from the surface of the heterostructure to the electrolyte solution and the self-reduction of the CuO layer by the accumulated electrons. More interestingly, introducing CuS on the surface of the Cu2O/CuO heterostructure provided highly enhanced photocurrent density with appreciable stability. This is probably because the as deposited CuS causes fast transfer of accumulated photogenerated electrons from the Cu2O/CuO surface (conduction band of CuO) to the aqueous solution for hydrogen production. Remarkably enhanced photocurrent density and stability is also suggested from the suppressed electron–hole recombination due to interfacial charge transfer (IFCT) initiated by visible light illumination (indicated by dark red arrow in Scheme 2). IFCT was theoretically proposed by Creutz et al. and in some other studies related to our work.40,43,44 That is, the electrons in the valence band of CuO can be directly transferred to CuS under visible illumination causing partial reduction of CuS to Cu2S (already confirmed by XPS analysis) as shown in reaction (3) below, and the reduced Cu2S state returns to CuS while generating H2 according to reaction (4). 2CuS + 2e → Cu2S + S2−(3) Cu2S + S2− + 2H+ → 2CuS + H2(4)
 Scheme 2  Schematic illustration of band energy levels and charge transfers for the Cu2O–CuO–CuS photocathode. 
Therefore, the CuS/Cu2S cluster located at a potential of −0.5 V (vs. SHE, pH = 0) acts as an electron sink and cocatalyst to promote the separation and transfer of photogenerated electrons from the surface of Cu2O/CuO to the CuS/Cu2S cluster, where H+ is reduced to hydrogen molecules.40 Thus, the improved photocurrent density and high stability of the Cu2O/CuO/CuS heterostructure is because CuS not only promotes charge separation, but also reduces bulk and surface electron–hole recombination. It is very important to consider the optimum amount of CuS because CuS deficiency increases electron–hole recombination while excess CuS blocks incident light and reduces the photocatalytic activity of the heterostructure. We believe that the synergistic effects induced by forming a Cu2O/CuO heterojunction and the incorporation of a CuS cocatalyst greatly accelerate electron transfer and effectively retard the reduction of CuO by photo-generated electrons.
4. Conclusions
To summarize, we have demonstrated a highly efficient and promising CuS modified Cu2O/CuO heterostructure for water splitting hydrogen production using a simple, low cost and scalable electrodeposition, thermal annealing and SILAR method. Both the photocurrent density and photostability are significantly enhanced by loading CuS as a cocatalyst on the Cu2O/CuO heterostructure. The optimal number of CuS SILAR deposition cycles is determined to be 9 (i.e. Cu2O/CuO/CuS-9) and the photoelectrode shows a 2.5 and 1.5 times increase in photocurrent density (−5.4 mA cm−2) and photostability (85%) respectively, compared with the bare Cu2O/CuO heterostructure. More importantly, the Cu2O/CuO heterostructure modified with optimum CuS produces an impressive solar conversion efficiency of ABPE% = 3.6% which is a greater than fourfold increase compared with the bare Cu2O/CuO. It is believed that solar light illumination causes interfacial charge transfer from CuO to CuS, which results in the partial reduction of CuS to Cu2S and efficient band to band electron excitation and separation between Cu2O and CuO due to their appropriate band alignment, and thus the separated and accumulated electrons in the conduction band of CuO flow to the CuS/Cu2S clusters. Since the potential of CuS/Cu2S is about −0.5 V (vs. SHE, pH = 0), which is more negative than the H+/H2 potential, reduction of H+ is favoured, thus enhancing the PEC performance of the photoelectrode. This study demonstrates the possible use of low cost and abundant CuS as a substitute for noble metals as a cocatalyst in photocatalytic H2 production.
