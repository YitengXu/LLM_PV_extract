    , Accepted 27th October 2021First published on 27th October 2021AbstractInverted perovskite solar cells (i-PSCs) manifest negligible hysteresis and potential to construct tandem solar cells attracting much attention, but their power conversion efficiency (PCE) still lags behind those of conventional ones due to non-radiative recombination from defect states and mismatched energy-level alignment for electron transport. Herein, we report on employing a hydroxylated non-fullerene acceptor (NFA), termed IT-DOH, to modify the interface between the perovskite and the electron transport layer (ETL) for reduced defects and improved electron transport. Compared with –CN and –CO groups in the parent molecule ITIC, additional –OH groups in IT-DOH can further suppress defect states by interacting with undercoordinated Pb2+. More importantly, the conjugated planes of IT-DOH can be elongated by intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions, leading to a long-range-ordered molecular arrangement and face-on orientation, which facilitates the electron transport from the perovskite to the ETL through IT-DOH molecules. Consequently, a record PCE of 22.09% among reported i-PSCs modified by NFAs is achieved from IT-DOH-treated i-PSCs. Our work highlights the importance of molecular ordering and orientation of the NFAs as interfacial materials, and provides a guideline to design NFAs by hydroxylation for highly efficient and stable i-PSCs.

Broader context
In the past decade, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great interest. Compared with conventional PSCs, inverted ones (i-PSCs) exhibit negligible hysteresis and suitability for fabricating tandem solar cells, but their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) still lag behind. To improve the PCE of i-PSCs, various interfacial modification materials have been developed to suppress the non-radiative recombination from defect states and tune the energy-level alignment between the perovskite and the electron transport layer (ETL). Among them, non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) that are widely used in organic photovoltaics are highly attractive since they possess defect-passivating groups and adjustable energy levels. High PCEs around 21% have been reported for NFA-modified i-PSCs, which are impressive but need to be further enhanced. Herein, we develop a hydroxylated NFA to reduce defect states and enhance interfacial electron extraction/transport at the perovskite/ETL interface. Besides passivating defects and affording an appropriate energy-level alignment as other NFAs, the hydroxylated NFA can further present a long-range-ordered molecular arrangement and face-on orientation. This is because the hydroxyl groups induce intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions to elongate the conjugated planes of the NFA molecules, favoring electron transport from the perovskite to the ETL. Consequently, a PCE of 22.09% has been achieved, which is a record efficiency among NFA-modified i-PSCs.

Introduction
Organic–inorganic metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have triggered extensive research and exhibited an unprecedentedly rapid increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE) over the past decade.1–6 Compared to conventional PSCs (n–i–p structure), inverted PSCs (p–i–n structure, i-PSCs) manifest negligible hysteresis and potential to construct tandem solar cells,7,8 but their PCEs still lag behind. The causes for such an efficiency gap mainly include non-radiative recombination losses resulting from defects on the surface and at the grain boundaries of the solution-processed perovskite film and mismatched energy-level alignment between the perovskite layer and the electron transport layer (ETL, such as the commonly used phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)).9–12
In order to surmount both issues, bifunctional molecules that can simultaneously passivate the defects and adjust the energy-level alignment at the perovskite/ETL interface are highly desirable. However, most of the passivating materials reported so far such as inorganic metal cations,13 halogen anions14 and organic molecules with specific functional groups5,15,16 can only passivate the defects but fail in another aspect. Therefore, conjugated organic semiconductors with adjustable energy levels and passivating groups are qualified candidates for such purposes. Particularly, non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) widely used in organic solar cells usually have a suitable lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level to facilitate the electron extraction and transport from the perovskite to the ETL and bear lone-pair electron-containing substituents for defect passivation.17,18 These features make the NFAs highly eligible as interface engineering materials between the perovskite and the ETL or as passivation additives in PSCs.17–22 Many NFAs have thus been reported (such as ITIC and Y6,23,24 Fig. S1, ESI†) in this regard to improve the performances of PSCs.19–21,25–40 Up to now, the highest PCE of 21.0% has been achieved from i-PSCs with the NFA as the interlayer or additive.19
Those reported works mostly focus on the suitable LUMO level and the defect passivation function of the NFAs. Their molecular order and orientation, which are highly related to the electron transport through the top surface or the grain boundaries of the perovskite film, where the NFA resides, are, however, relatively seldom considered. Designing novel NFAs with an ordered molecular arrangement and preferred face-on orientation and applying them to i-PSCs will further improve the electron extraction and transport at the perovskite/ETL interface and thus the device performance. Meanwhile, the way of incorporating the NFA into i-PSCs also plays a key role. The NFAs are usually introduced by being dissolved in the precursor solution or as an interlayer.19,20 In the former way, the distribution of NFA molecules through the perovskite layer is uncontrollable, leading to their possible contact with the hole-transporting layer,10,41 while the latter one is unfavorable for the electron transport from the perovskite to the ETL (PCBM) due to the lower electron mobility of the NFA than PCBM. Instead, introducing the NFA into the anti-solvent can yield a controllable and gradient distribution near the top surface of the perovskite film,39 reducing the average distance of electron transport in the perovskite and efficiently improving the electron extraction and transport from the perovskite to the ETL.
In this work, we report the use of a hydroxylated NFA (IT-DOH, Fig. 1a) at the perovskite/ETL interface via dissolving it in the anti-solvent to reduce defect states and enhance interfacial electron extraction and transport for highly efficient i-PSCs. It is found that the IT-DOH molecule is mainly distributed at the grain boundaries, where it functions in three ways. First, compared to the reference molecule ITIC, besides the –CN and –CO groups, the additional –OH can further passivate the defects of the perovskite film by interacting with undercoordinated Pb2+, thereby suppressing the non-radiative recombination more efficiently. Second, the LUMO level of IT-DOH locates between the conduction band of the perovskite and the LUMO level of the ETL, forming a cascade energy-level alignment, which promotes the electron extraction. More importantly, the IT-DOH molecules locating at the grain boundaries present a long-range-ordered molecular arrangement and face-on orientation owing to elongated conjugated planes induced by intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions, favoring electron transport from the perovskite to the ETL. As a result, IT-DOH can passivate defects and transport electrons more efficiently than the parent ITIC, resulting in an impressive PCE of 22.09% for i-PSCs with improved stability.

Results and discussion
Distribution of IT-DOH in the perovskite film
The IT-DOH molecule was synthesized according to a previous procedure.42 The perovskite film treated with the IT-DOH molecule was prepared by adding it into chlorobenzene as the anti-solvent which was dripped on the perovskite film during the spin-coating process, followed by annealing in a nitrogen-filled glove box (Fig. 1a). A perovskite film without IT-DOH treatment was also prepared as a reference in the same way. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images display that the control perovskite film shows apparent domain boundaries (Fig. 1b), while the IT-DOH-treated one exhibits a twisted-strip feature (Fig. 1c). In the zoomed in image, it can be seen that the domain boundaries of the IT-DOH-treated perovskite film have become blurred, implying that the IT-DOH molecules may penetrate into the interfaces of perovskite grains along the boundaries, which can be further confirmed by photo-induced force microscopy (PiFM). To identify the characteristic vibrational absorption of IT-DOH, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was carried out for the IT-DOH film at first (Fig. S2, ESI†), and the vibrational signal of –CO at 1680 cm−1 was chosen to distinguish the IT-DOH distribution in the perovskite film. As shown in Fig. 1d and e, the IT-DOH molecules mostly locate between perovskite grains rather than aggregating on the top surface. The distribution of IT-DOH can passivate the defects and enhance the electron transport at the grain boundaries; at the same time it will not induce extra resistance for electron transfer on the perovskite surface. The grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) results (Fig. 1f, g and Fig. S3, ESI†) suggest that the perovskite film with IT-DOH shows a higher diffraction intensity at q = 1 and 2 Å−1 belonging to (001) and (002) crystal planes,21,43 respectively, compared with that of the control one, confirming the stronger crystallinity of the perovskite after introducing IT-DOH. In addition, the diffraction peak of PbI2 at q = 0.9 Å−1 is greatly suppressed after applying IT-DOH. The decreased PbI2 signal may be ascribed to the conversion of PbI2 to the perovskite phase21 and/or amorphous species formed by the interaction between IT-DOH molecules and PbI2.44,45
Improved defect passivation and electron transport by IT-DOH
To unveil the interactions between IT-DOH and the perovskite, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on the IT-DOH-treated perovskite film. As a comparison, the ITIC-treated analogue was also measured because it has been reported that ITIC can inhibit defect formation in the perovskite film, which was attributed to the interaction between electron-deficient groups (–CN and –CO) of ITIC and undercoordinated Pb2+.20,46 As shown in Fig. 2a and Table S1 in the ESI,† the Pb 4f core level of the pristine perovskite contains two features with the binding energy at 143.72 eV and 138.87 eV. After treatment with ITIC, the peaks of the Pb 4f core level move to a lower binding energy, mainly attributed to the interaction between –CN and –CO groups of ITIC and undercoordinated Pb2+ of the perovskite film, as mentioned above.20,33 In the case of IT-DOH, such peaks further shift to a lower binding energy. We thus believe that the additional –OH groups in IT-DOH interact with the undercoordinated Pb2+ as well, which can be further confirmed by the proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) measurement.47,48 To avoid the influence of other groups in IT-DOH, the terminal group of this molecule, 1-hydroxyl-3-dicycanovinylindan-1-one (IC–OH, Fig. 2b inset), was utilized to detect the change of the –OH signal in the presence of PbI2. As shown in Fig. 2b, the proton of –OH in the IC–OH peaking at δ = 11.13 ppm exhibits a downfield shift of Δδ = 0.04 ppm, indicating that the –OH groups indeed interact with PbI2. Therefore, compared with ITIC, IT-DOH can passivate the defects of the perovskite more efficiently, contributed by the –OH groups.

The CsFAMA perovskite is used here. 
To figure out the passivation effect, electron-only devices with a structure of ITO/SnO2/control or treated perovskite/PCBM/BCP/Ag (Fig. 2c inset) were then constructed to quantitatively evaluate the trap density of perovskite films by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. As shown in Fig. 2c, the trap-filling limit voltage (VTFL) is denoted as the transition voltage from the Ohmic region to the trap-filling limited region, which is related to the trap density (Nt).49 The Nt of the IT-DOH-treated perovskite film is 1.40 × 1015 cm−3, much lower than that of control (5.54 × 1015 cm−3) and ITIC-treated ones (2.49 × 1015 cm−3). In addition, thermal admittance spectroscopy was also carried out to measure the trap density of states in operated solar cells (Fig. S4, ESI†).43,50 The results (Fig. 2d–f) show that the Nt in IT-DOH-treated devices is the lowest, in agreement with the trend presented by the SCLC method. The remarkably reduced Nt suggests that IT-DOH is indeed a good candidate for passivating defects in the perovskite film, suppressing the non-radiative recombination in the derived i-PSCs more efficiently than ITIC.
Next, we investigate the impact of IT-DOH molecules on the electron extraction and transport characteristics in the perovskite film by steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy,51,52 respectively. In the steady-state PL spectra (Fig. 2g and Table S2, ESI†), the pristine perovskite film displays an emission band peaking at 762.6 nm, which hypochromatically shifts to 759.5 and 755.5 nm after treatment with ITIC and IT-DOH, further proving the passivation of the perovskite defects. More importantly, PL emissions of the ITIC- and IT-DOH-treated perovskite films are remarkably quenched relative to that of the pristine one, and more obvious quenching is observed for the IT-DOH case. The results suggest that IT-DOH can more efficiently extract electrons from the perovskite than ITIC. Furthermore, in the TRPL spectra, the PL decay of the IT-DOH-treated perovskite film is much faster and the lifetime is much shorter than those of the ITIC-treated one (Fig. 2h and Table S3, ESI†), indicating the more efficient electron extraction from the perovskite to IT-DOH molecules. The different electron extraction ability is usually explained by varied LUMO levels of interfacial layer materials. However, both ITIC and IT-DOH molecules have a LUMO level of about 3.92 eV (Fig. 2i), which cannot result in an apparent difference in the electron extraction. Distinct from ITIC, IT-DOH exhibits a long-range-ordered structure, higher crystallinity, and face-on orientation, as characterized by high-resolution TEM and GIWAXS (Fig. S5a–d, ESI†). Such observations are induced by the intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which can be evidenced by the FTIR measurement (Fig. S5e and f, ESI†).42 Herein, we further confirm the hydrogen-bonding interaction between IT-DOH molecules with the 2D 1H–1H double-quantum/single-quantum (DQ/SQ) NMR spectrum (Fig. S5g and h, ESI†). A signal appears at (9.87, 19.66) ppm, very close to the diagonal, which can be clearly seen in the correlative 1D spectrum sliced from 19.66 ppm at F1 dimension; the strong signal originates from the proximity of two hydrogen bonds.53–55 These features make IT-DOH contribute to the more efficient electron extraction and transport relative to ITIC.
To further understand the charge carrier dynamics of the perovskite film after the IT-DOH treatment, we carried out transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS, Fig. 3a–e). Interestingly, we find that in the first 2 ps, the signal of ground state bleaching (GSB) at 748 nm promptly decays for the control perovskite film, which can be induced by the trap-filling process. In contrast, it doesn’t happen for the IT-DOH-treated perovskite film, demonstrating the defect passivation of the perovskite by IT-DOH. In order to further confirm the above conclusion, we investigate the exciton dynamics in perovskite films on a short timescale (ca. 100 ps) with up-conversion photoluminescence measurements (Fig. 3f). The exciton emission peak of the control perovskite film decays slightly faster than that of the IT-DOH-treated one within 5 ps, after which the emission peak decay for both films is in general agreement with each other. Accordingly, these observations suggest a trap-filling procedure on an ultrafast timescale for the control perovskite film, which, however, doesn’t occur for the IT-DOH-treated one, indicating the passivation by IT-DOH. In addition, on 1 ns timescale in Fig. 3e, the GSB signal of the IT-DOH-treated perovskite film decays faster than that of the control one, ascribed to the charge transfer from the perovskite to IT-DOH. Therefore, the results of TAS have further proved that IT-DOH plays roles in both passivating the defects in the perovskite film and extracting electrons from the perovskite.

Working mechanism of IT-DOH
According to the above results, a reasonable working mechanism of IT-DOH for improved defect passivation and electron transport of the perovskite film is proposed and illustrated in Fig. 4. The IT-DOH molecules penetrate and reside at the perovskite grain boundaries in the process of perovskite film formation, leading to a gradient distribution close to the perovskite film surface. In such a circumstance, it provides more opportunities for IT-DOH interacting with the perovskite to suppress the defects in the bulk and extracting electrons from the perovskite grains. Firstly, compared with ITIC, additional –OH groups of IT-DOH can further passivate the defects by interacting with undercoordinated Pb2+ besides the –CN and –CO groups. This can suppress the non-radiative recombination more efficiently, leading to a higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) for i-PSCs. Secondly, the formation of the cascade energy level after introducing IT-DOH molecules improves the electron extraction from the perovskite, which is similar to that of ITIC due to their same LUMO levels (Fig. 2i). Differently from ITIC but more importantly, the extended conjugated planes of IT-DOH molecules induced by the intermolecular hydrogen bonding enable a long-range-ordered molecular arrangement and face-on orientation (Fig. S5d, ESI†), which can provide an additional pathway for separated electrons transporting from the perovskite to the PCBM layer. This procedure is helpful for reducing energy loss in the process of electron transport and thus contributing to the enhancement of the short-circuit current density (Jsc) of i-PSCs.

Hydrogen bonding interaction between the terminal groups of adjacent IT-DOH molecules is shown in the solid line box. The interactions between functional groups of IT-DOH and ITIC and perovskite defects are depicted in the dashed line box. 
Device performances of IT-DOH-treated i-PSCs
The effects of defect passivation and electron transport enhanced by IT-DOH on device performances were then evaluated by fabricating i-PSCs with a structure displayed in Fig. 5a. The ITIC-treated devices were fabricated as a reference as well. Two kinds of perovskites, Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 (CsFAMA; FA, formamidinium; MA, methylammonium) and Cs0.05FA0.95PbI3 (CsFA), were used for device fabrication. By optimizing the concentration of IT-DOH in the anti-solvent (Fig. S6 and Table S4, ESI†), IT-DOH-treated i-PSCs based on the CsFAMA perovskite yielded a PCE of 21% (Fig. 5b and Table 1), higher than those obtained from control and ITIC-treated devices. When using the CsFA perovskite as the light-harvesting layer, device performances are analogous to the trend exhibited by CsFAMA-based ones, with an impressive PCE of 22.09% (Fig. 5c and Table 1) for IT-DOH-treated i-PSCs, indicating the universality of the IT-DOH treatment method. The efficiency achieved here is the highest value among reported i-PSCs employing NFAs as interfacial materials, as summarized in Fig. 5d. The statistics of device performance based on the CsFAMA (Fig. 5e) and CsFA perovskite (Fig. S7, ESI†) reveal the good reproducibility of the IT-DOH-treated PSCs. The PCE improvements are contributed from the increases of Jsc and Voc (Fig. 5e), which are ascribed to the more efficient electron extraction/transport and defect passivation by IT-DOH, as discussed above. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured to calibrate the improvement of current density. The Jsc integrated from EQE data (Fig. S8, ESI†) is in accordance with that from J–V curves of CsFAMA-based devices, which confirms the improved Jsc. Besides, the hysteresis of devices with IT-DOH is negligible under reverse and forward scanning directions (Fig. S9, ESI†). A stabilized PCE is measured at the maximum power output point (MPP) under AM 1.5 G 100 mW cm−2 illumination without any filter in nitrogen (Fig. S10, ESI†), indicating much more stable performance of IT-DOH-based devices than reference ones. In addition, the shelf lifetime of devices is also evaluated, where the devices without encapsulation still maintain about 93% of their initial PCE even after one year of storage (Fig. S11, ESI†). These results demonstrate that the IT-DOH treatment of the perovskite film can efficiently enhance the stability of devices, which can be attributed to more efficient defect passivation by IT-DOH molecules.

Charge carrier dynamics of IT-DOH-treated i-PSCs
To understand the contributions of IT-DOH to the improvement of Jsc and Voc in i-PSCs, the charge carrier dynamics including charge transport and recombination behaviors in the operated devices were systematically studied. The dependence of photocurrent density (Jph) on the effective voltage (Veff) is shown in Fig. 6a. The charge collection probability P using the equation P = Jph/Jsat indicates that the charge collection in IT-DOH-based devices is more efficient than that in reference ones (Table S5, ESI†).56 The incident light intensity (Pin) dependence of Jsc is studied and the slope of the IT-DOH-treated device is 1 (Fig. S12, ESI†), suggesting a negligible bimolecular recombination.57 The Pin dependence of Voc is also studied (Fig. 6b), and the slope deviating from kT q−1 reflects trap-induced recombination. When the slope is closer to 1 kT q−1, the trap-induced recombination is suppressed more efficiently. After fitting the results of Pin dependence of Voc, the slope of the IT-DOH-treated i-PSCs is 1.405 kT q−1, much smaller than that of control (1.784 kT q−1) and ITIC-treated (1.510 kT q−1) devices, which tells that the trap-assisted recombination of devices is suppressed efficiently by the IT-DOH treatment.5,33,50 Besides, the transient photovoltage (TPV) measurement was carried out to study the free charge carrier lifetime in the operated devices.58,59 As shown in Fig. 6c, the photovoltage of IT-DOH-treated devices shows the slowest decay lifetime (fitting data in Table S6, ESI†), suggesting a suppressed charge carrier recombination in comparison to references. Accordingly, the losses in i-PSCs are dominated by the non-geminate charge recombination, and the suppression of such recombination results in the PCE improvement of IT-DOH-treated i-PSCs.

(d) Nyquist plots of PSCs with different treatment conditions measured under bias of Voc in the dark; inset: equivalent circuit model. PSCs for these measurements are based on the CsFAMA perovskite. 
Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted.60 As shown in Fig. 6d, the Nyquist plots display two semicircles representing two resistances, which are empirically attributed to charge transfer resistance (Rct) and charge carrier recombination resistance (Rrec), respectively. Obviously, the i-PSCs with IT-DOH show the smallest Rct and the largest Rrec (Table S7, ESI†) compared with those of control and ITIC-based devices, demonstrating that in IT-DOH-treated PSCs, the photogenerated charge transport through the interfaces is more efficient and the charge recombination is suppressed, which contributes to the increased Jsc and Voc.
Conclusions
In summary, we have presented an effective strategy to reduce the defects and improve the interfacial electron extraction/transport from the perovskite to the ETL by using an NFA, IT-DOH, achieving a champion PCE of 22.09% among reported i-PSCs modified by NFAs. The IT-DOH molecules can mainly locate at the grain boundaries of the perovskite film by adjusting its concentration in the anti-solvent. The –OH groups on IT-DOH can interact with undercoordinated Pb2+, offering additional defect passivation with respect to –CN and –CO groups in the parent ITIC, which is beneficial for suppressing the non-radiative recombination more efficiently. Identical to ITIC, the appropriate LUMO level of IT-DOH can also form a cascade energy level with the conduction band of the perovskite and the LUMO level of PCBM, improving the electron extraction from the perovskite. Differently and more importantly, the –OH groups can extend the conjugated planes of IT-DOH molecules by intermolecular hydrogen bonding, leading to their higher crystallinity and preferred face-on orientation in grain boundaries, which facilitate the electron transport from the perovskite to the ETL. The suppressed non-radiative recombination and the enhanced electron extraction/transport synergistically contribute to the increased Jsc and Voc of i-PSCs treated with IT-DOH. Our work demonstrates that the hydroxylation of an NFA molecule is extremely crucial for both reduced defects and improved electron extraction/transport, leading to highly efficient and stable i-PSCs.

Broader context
In the past decade, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great interest. Compared with conventional PSCs, inverted ones (i-PSCs) exhibit negligible hysteresis and suitability for fabricating tandem solar cells, but their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) still lag behind. To improve the PCE of i-PSCs, various interfacial modification materials have been developed to suppress the non-radiative recombination from defect states and tune the energy-level alignment between the perovskite and the electron transport layer (ETL). Among them, non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) that are widely used in organic photovoltaics are highly attractive since they possess defect-passivating groups and adjustable energy levels. High PCEs around 21% have been reported for NFA-modified i-PSCs, which are impressive but need to be further enhanced. Herein, we develop a hydroxylated NFA to reduce defect states and enhance interfacial electron extraction/transport at the perovskite/ETL interface. Besides passivating defects and affording an appropriate energy-level alignment as other NFAs, the hydroxylated NFA can further present a long-range-ordered molecular arrangement and face-on orientation. This is because the hydroxyl groups induce intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions to elongate the conjugated planes of the NFA molecules, favoring electron transport from the perovskite to the ETL. Consequently, a PCE of 22.09% has been achieved, which is a record efficiency among NFA-modified i-PSCs.
