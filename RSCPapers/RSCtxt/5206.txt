Nonetheless, while specific candidates have exhibited visible-blind ultraviolet (UV) photoelectric response, most R–P type 2D materials have been known to be photosensitive to visible light. In this study, an R–P type 2D lead bromide hybrid perovskite (C8H11FN)2PbBr4, (1, where C8H10FN is 4-fluorophenethylamine) has been analyzed, which contained both inorganic frameworks and organic cations. Moreover, 1 exhibits a relatively wide optical bandgap of 3.30 eV, corresponding to that of the Br-based 2D R–P perovskites expected to exhibit selective photoresponse for the UV light. It is pertinent to note that the photodetectors based on the crystal of 1 exhibit spectral selective photoresponse for UV light with high detectivity up to ∼1.6 × 1011 Jones. Moreover, the trap density of 1 is estimated to be 1.34 × 1011 cm−3; the trap density of 1 was almost equal to that obtained in the high-quality 3D CH3NH3PbBr3 single crystals. Besides, under external environment, 1 illustrated excellent stability. The figures of merit for its photoconductivity make 1 a potential candidate for the visible-blind UV photodetection. This discovery opens up new vistas for the further development of optoelectronic devices based on 2D R–P organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites.
Introduction
Ultraviolet (UV) photodetection, as one of the most crucial optoelectronic applications, has been used widely used in plasmonic devices, photodetectors, and terahertz imagers.1,2 Most currently-studied systems are made up of conventional inorganic semiconductors.3 Nevertheless, complex processing and inferior structural turnability are the inherent constraints of most of the inorganic materials.4 Nonetheless, although these inorganic 2D materials could be applied to UV photodetection, the fabrication techniques of the photodetector devices remain sophisticated. Hence, it is urgently desired to explore new 2D candidates with visible-blind UV photoelectric active. Recently, the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have generated significant interest due to the efficient photo-generated exciton dissociation,4 strong light-harvesting capability,5 facile solution fabrication processing,6 and excellent carrier transport.7,8 For example, the power conversion efficiency of the three-dimensional (3D) hybrid perovskites (e.g. CH3NH3PbI3) solar cell has been comparable to that of monocrystalline silicon solar cells.9,10 Despite these excellent performances, the stability of such 3D perovskites has still been limited under the conditions of moisture and oxygen.11–13
With anisotropic charge transport, stronger self-trapping, suppressed ionic migration, the 2D analogous exhibits much higher structural stability, as compared to the 3D perovskites.14–26 In quantum mechanics and chemistry, with their larger degrees of freedom, these benefits offer more tenability of their optoelectronic properties. The engagement of the diammonium cations to form  (A = 1+ cation, A′ = 1+ cation, M = Pb2+, Sn2+, Cu2+, etc., X = Cl−, Br−, and I−), could be an alternative to the monoammonium cations reported till date Ruddlesden–Popper (R–P) type 2D perovskites. Acting as bridges to interact electrostatically with the [MX6]2− slabs in the stacking direction, these topic cations have one positive ends. With a 3D like character and a much shorter distance between the inorganic layers, the overall rigidity of the structure and the holding potential of highly efficient charge transport in contrast to the  family get enhanced, with the diammonium cations providing stronger links between each inorganic layer.19–22 On one hand, the R–P type 2D layered perovskites are reported as showing relatively more stability;27–29 on the other hand, such perovskites also exhibit various and unique physical properties, like high carrier mobility and low trap density.30–39 All these unique properties make this type of perovskite a potential candidate for the next-generation optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices. Moreover, owing to the important role on the bandgap of halogen, the Br-based R–P type 2D perovskites are expected to exhibit selective photoresponse for the UV light due to its wider bandgap compared with that of the bromide and the iodide counterparts. The majority of R–P type 2D materials have been found to exhibit photosensitivity to visible light, while few candidates have exhibited visible-blind UV photoelectric response.
Here, we present an RP-type 2D lead bromide hybrid perovskite (C8H11FN)2PbBr4, (1, where C8H10FN is 4-fluorophenethylamine) which features a sizeable optical bandgap (∼3.30 eV). It corresponds to that the Br-based 2D R–P perovskites are expected to exhibit selective photoresponse for UV light due to its wide bandgap. Taking advantage of the unique property, a visible-blind UV photodetector with high detectivity up to ∼1.6 × 1011 Jones was fabricated based on the crystal of 1. Namely, the photodetector based on the crystal of 1 exhibited a spectral selective photoresponse for UV light. The trap density of 1 is estimated to be 1.34 × 1011 cm−3; the trap density of 1 was almost equal to that obtained in the high-quality 3D CH3NH3PbBr3 single crystals (ntrap = 1010–1011 cm−3). Nonetheless, 1 exhibited excellent stability under external environmental ambience. The figures of merit for its photoconductivity make 1 a potential candidate for the visible-blind UV photodetection. This discovery opens up new vistas for other optoelectronic devices based on 2D R–P organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites.
Results and discussion
Confirming the phase purity of 1, the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern is collected at room temperature, which agrees with the calculated data (ESI,† Fig. S1). The structure analyses indicated that 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group, C2/c, featuring a 2D R–P type structure (Fig. 1.). Thus, the structural motif of 1 adopts a typical 2D R–P perovskite framework of  (n = 1). The cell parameters for 1 are a = 32.7746(6) Å, b = 8.1052(1) Å, c = 8.3503(2) Å, β = 95.503(2)°, Z = 4 and V = 2207.99(7) Å3 (ESI,† Table S1). The shared angular octahedron is spread out to construct a two-dimensional inorganic perovskite skeleton along the bc plane. Besides, the C8H11FN+ cations are located between the two inorganic layers. The octahedra of the PbBr6 are slightly distorted, which can be illustrated from the obvious Br–Pb–Br bond angles and the Pb–Br bond lengths (ESI,† Tables S2 and S3). Such dynamic molecular motions are essential for the displacement of the positive and negative charge centers.

The semiconducting and optical properties of 1 are investigated to evaluate the potential for visible-blind UV photodetection. Generally, the optical properties of crystals are observed to be closely related to their photoelectric properties.40 The UV-vis absorption spectrum was measured to explore the optical absorption properties of 1. The sharp absorption edge at 380 nm, indicating 1's ability for selective absorption of UV light. The optical bandgap (Eg) estimated by the Tauc equation is 3.30 eV (inset of Fig. 2a), which is smaller than those of (benzylammonium)2PbCl4 (3.65 eV) and (ethylammonium)4Pb3Cl10 (3.39 eV), but is larger than that of (cyclohexylammonium)2PbBr4 (2.95 eV).41 It reveals the importance of the choice of halogen in the degree of the bandgap. This absorption region could facilitate the photon absorption and thus improve the photoelectric performance of a spectrum absorption photodetector based on the crystals. By using the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the bandgap and the partial density of states (PDOS) are investigated. The theoretically calculated bandgap (≈3.54 eV), which is bigger than the optical bandgap 3.30 eV. Due to the limitations of DFT, these bandgap values are slightly different from the experimental values.42,43 Coincided well with the optical bandgap. Implying the perovskite having an indirect bandgap feature, the maximum of the valence and the minimum of the conduction bands were found to be located at different points. The maximum valence band was dominated by the Br-4p orbit. In contrast, the Pb-6p orbit offered the conduction band minimum, as displayed by the PDOS (Fig. 2b), indicating that the semiconducting properties of 1 were almost derived from its layered inorganic part. Besides, the temperature-dependent conductivity of 1 was measured at the temperature of 300–380 K. As the temperature increased, the slope of conductivity illustrated an apparent increasing trend (Fig. 2c). This result confirmed the semiconducting characteristics of 1. Exciton binding energy (Eb) is an important characteristic of 2D materials. The quantum confinement of the 2D inorganic sheets enhances the Eb relative to the 3D materials.

As depicted in Fig. 3a, based on the grown single crystals (Fig. S1†) of 1, a photodetector with a planar configuration was manufactured by covering a Au-conductive paste (the substrate was the glass). Subsequently, photodetectors based on single crystals of 1 were used for photoelectric testing. The I–V traces at various incident illumination power at the wavelength of 254 nm and collected in the dark, were as indicated in Fig. 3b. The current–voltage (I–V) curves showed a linear relationship when photo-illuminated using a UV light (λ = 254 nm). Being comparable with certain 2D hybrid perovskites such as the (C4H9NH3)2PbBr4, the dark current (Idark) of 1.2 × 10−10 A (Fig. 3c) was shown at the bias of 10 V. Nonetheless, 1 was found to be sensitive to the UV radiation but almost blind to the standard visible light (Fig. 3c). The current value was measured under the light of 254 nm. And the switching ratio (SR) calculated by following the formula,  
SR was estimated to be ≈60 at the wavelength of 254 nm. The variation tendency was entirely consistent with the absorption spectrum. The response time was one of the most crucial performance indexes of the photodetectors, which was related to the extraction of the photogenerated charge carriers. When the illumination laser was turned on/off, the time photocurrent of 1 rose/fell quickly (Fig. 3d). According to Fig. 3e, the rise time (tr) was 520 ms and the decay time (tf) was 540 ms. The response could be due to the defects in high-quality single crystals and low trap density, which greatly facilitated the carrier transport. Compared to those reported by UV photodetectors based on the ZnO, these response times were found highly superior (rise time: 48 s; decay time: 0.9 s)44 and TiO2 thin films (rise time: 6 s; decay time: 15 s).45 Moreover, Fig. 3e illustrates the time photocurrent of 1 in the process of light switch.

(e) Temporal photoresponse with the rise/decay times of ∼520 and ∼540 μs, respectively. (f) Logarithmic I–V measurements according to the SCLC method. 
Further, its charge transport properties were studied by adopting the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) technique. The current–voltage (I–V) curves were measured to evaluate the quality and the electric performances of the device of 1. The I–V curve could be segregated into three different regions as indicated in Fig. 3f: the Child's region (n = 2), the trap-filled limited regime (n > 3) and the low-voltage ohmic region (n = 1). With an increased bias voltage, the current signal slowly rises in the ohmic area and then increases sharply, indicating its entry into the trap-filled limited area, and ultimately entering the Child's area with a quadratic voltage dependence. The trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) was observed at the kink point for calculating the trap density (ntrap). Exploiting the linear dependence between VTFL and the trap density (ntraps)  where, relative dielectric constant was denoted by ε, ε0 denoted the dielectric constant in vacuum, the distance between the two conductive electrodes was denoted by L, while e was the elemental charge. Hence, almost equivalent to that obtained in the high-quality 3D CH3NH3PbBr3 single crystals (ntrap = 1010–1011 cm−3),29 the trap density of 1 was estimated to be 3.86 × 1011 cm−3, the ntrap in the 1 single crystal was estimated to be 1.34 × 1011 cm−3. Nonetheless, much smaller than those of the various inorganic semiconductors (e.g., Si, ntrap = 1014 cm−3; CdTe/CdS, ntrap = 1013 cm−3).30 Being advantageous of its application to the optoelectronic devices and contributing to the transport of the photo-excited charge carriers, the high-quality of the as-grown crystals is suggested by such low trap density. These features have potential of 1 for high-performance, visible-blind UV photodetection.
Indicating high reliability and the remarkable photostability of the single crystal-based photodetectors of 1 as indicated by the photocurrent signals remaining almost unchanged. The responsivity (R) was calculated as follows, and as illustrated in Fig. 4a:  where, incident light power was indicated by Plight, the dark current by Idark, and the photocurrent by Ilight. At the bias voltage of 10 V, the responsivity of the photodetector based on 1 single crystal was estimated to be around 288 mA W−1. The photodetectivity (D) has been an essential index for assessing the ability of the photodetectors to detect optical signals. For 1, the detectivity to the UV-light was estimated by using:  where, the dark current density was reflected by Jdark and the elementary charge was q. The detectivity was thus calculated to be ∼1.6 × 1011 Jones (Fig. 4b), which was calculated using the above formula.
The phase instability in the ambient air remained a considerable challenge that hindered the development of practical equipment for practical device application. Hence, the environmental stability of the material was determined through PXRD and thermogravimetric analysis. The results indicated that the compound had better phase stability than the traditional organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites such as CH3NH3PbI3, with comparable results concerning the other photodetectors based upon the classic two-dimensional materials.

Conclusions
In conclusion, a 2D Br-based organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite, (C8H11FN)2PbBr4, (1, where C8H10FN is 4-fluorophenethylamine), has been explored, featuring the typical 2D RP-type structure. Notably, such Br-based perovskite featured a large bandgap of 3.30 eV and further exhibited a distinctly selective photoresponse to the UV light with high detectivity. Moreover, it shows low trap density and long carrier lifetime. The relatively high stability and superior photodetection performance make 1 a potential candidate for visible-blind UV photodetection. This study undoubtedly opens up a broad opportunity to rationally design 2D hybrid perovskite for potentially intentional application.
