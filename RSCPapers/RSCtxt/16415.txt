    , Accepted 10th August 2022First published on 10th August 2022AbstractAdding an interface passivation layer on the perovskite is one of the most effective methods to achieve high-efficiency and high-stability perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a novel dye molecule, namely ethyl-2-((6-hydroxyquinolin-5-yl)diazenyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzo[b]thiophene-3-carboxylate (HQTh-EC), was synthesized and used as an interlayer between the perovskite absorber layer and the spiro-OMeTAD layer. It was found that the HQTh-EC passivation layer played various roles, such as effectively reducing defect states, enabling appropriate energy level alignment, restraining charge carrier recombination, and accelerating hole extraction. Consequently, the HQTh-EC-optimized PSCs delivered an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.08%, much improved compared with that of the pristine PSCs (16.73%). Moreover, the HQTh-EC interlayer greatly enhanced the stability of PSCs, which retained 86% of their initial PCE after 400 h aging under ambient air with a relative humidity (RH) of 70–80%. This work provides a useful strategy to simultaneously enhance the performance and stability of PSCs by introduction of a dye interlayer, and will pave the way for fabricating high-performance planar devices under an air environment.
1. Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite compounds are considered promising materials for application in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and other photovoltaics owing to their outstanding optoelectronic properties, for example, high absorption coefficients,1 long-range carrier diffusion lengths2,3 and adjustable band gaps.4 Until now, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has rapidly increased from 3.8% to 25.7%.5,6
As we know, during the solution process of perovskite films, particularly fabrication under an air environment, a large number of unfavorable defects are inevitably generated. The defects on the perovskite boundary and surface lead to non-radiative recombination, thus hindering the further improvement of PCE and device stability.7,8 Besides, perovskite materials are difficult to preserve in a humid air atmosphere because the defects on the perovskite surface bond with water and oxygen in air, in turn, accelerating the degradation of the perovskite.9–11 In order to protect the perovskite film from moisture, on one hand, many researchers fabricate high-efficiency and state-of-the-art PSCs within a glovebox, which restricts their industrial manufacturing due to the inconvenient operation. Furthermore, fabricating PSCs with fewer defects, good stability and high PCE under ambient conditions (without a glovebox) is necessary for commercialized applications of PSCs. On the other hand, various strategies, such as additive engineering,12,13 interfacial engineering,14,15 using novel hole transport materials with high mobility and conductivity16,17 and so on, have been applied to enhance the performance and stability of PSCs. Among them, most researchers focus on studying functional groups that can interact with the perovskite to form coordination bonds by using interface passivation materials, correspondingly, efficiently passivating surface defects and regulating perovskite carrier recombination behavior.
Based on this context, we concentrate on finding novel and low-cost molecules to achieve the above-mentioned effects. In particular, dye molecules can be considered as special molecules with advanced optical and electronic features because of the chromophore nature, which can passivate the defects of the perovskite film, enhance light absorption properties and promote charge transfer at the same time.18 Several feasible additive strategies13,19–21 have been reported to enhance the performance of PSCs. However, little attention is paid to the effect of the dye interlayer on the perovskite absorber layer. Actually, depositing an interfacial modifier layer atop the perovskite absorber layer is essential due to its facile preparation process with no need to change the fabrication process of the perovskite layer, which can passivate the defects of the perovskite, facilitate the charge carrier extraction and enhance the stability of PSCs.
Herein, we synthesized a dye, ethyl-2-((6-hydroxyquinolin-5-yl)diazenyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzo[b]thiophene-3-carboxylate (abbreviated as HQTh-EC), and applied it as the interlayer between the perovskite layer and the spiro-OMeTAD layer to fabricate a high-quality perovskite film under an air environment. In general, π-conjugated molecules display intramolecular charge transfer properties. The introduction of the HQTh-EC interlayer between the perovskite layer and spiro-OMeTAD layer resulted in well-matched energy level alignment, which accelerated the hole extraction process. Besides, the HQTh-EC interfacial modification layer, containing the thiophene and carboxyl groups, effectually passivated the surface defects of the perovskite and tuned the surface potential of the perovskite, which could reduce the charge carrier recombination, improve the charge carrier transport of PSCs and enhance the photovoltaic performance and stability of PSCs. As a result, PSCs with a HQTh-EC interface passivation layer exhibited a higher PCE of 20.08% than the pristine device (16.73%). In addition, PSCs with the HQTh-EC interface passivation layer showed boosted stability under an ambient environment (20–30 °C and 70–80% relative humidity (RH)). The device retained over 80% of the initial PCE after 400 h of storage due to the improved hydrophobicity of the perovskite film.
2. Experimental

Diazotization reaction. 
Ethyl 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzo[b]thiophene-3-carboxylate (10 mmol), concentrated water (20 mL) and hydrochloric acid (20 mL) were added into a three-necked flask (100 mL) and stirred vigorously to dissolve the solid substance at room temperature. Then, the reaction flask was placed in an ice water bath to cool down to about 0 °C. Then, a pre-prepared aqueous sodium nitrite solution (0.759 g NaNO2/5 mL water) was added dropwise in 10 min. The reaction mixture was continuously stirred at 0 °C for 30 min. A starch potassium iodide test paper was used to detect whether the nitrous acid was excessive. If necessary, urea was added to remove the excess nitrous acid. Thus, the diazonium salt solution was obtained for the next step.


Coupling reaction. 
In another three-necked flask (100 mL), a mixture of quinolin-6-ol (10 mmol), water (20 mL) and sodium carbonate was added. The reaction flask was placed in an ice water bath to cool down to 0 °C. Then, the above-mentioned diazonium salt solution was added dropwise. The pH value of the aqueous solution was maintained at 9–10 by adding extra sodium carbonate during the dropping process. After dropping, the mixture was continuously reacted for 2 h until the reaction finished. The pH value of the solution was regulated to be less than 3 by dropping a hydrochloric acid solution (2 mol L−1). The mixture was left to stand, and the precipitate was filtered. The filter cake was washed with deionized water until the filtrate was neutral. Finally, the reaction product was dried at 60 °C in an oven, and the target product was obtained. HQTh-EC (2.74 g) was obtained as a bright-red solid in 65% yield. 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm): 14.73 (s, 1H), 8.91 (d, J = 8.4 Hz, 1H), 8.80 (dd, J1 = 4.0 Hz, J2 = 1.6 Hz, 1H), 8.03 (d, J = 9.2 Hz, 1H), 7.47 (dd, J1 = 8.4 Hz, J2 = 4.0 Hz, 1H), 7.33 (d, J = 9.2 Hz, 1H), 4.48 (q, J = 7.2 Hz, 2H), 2.88 (t, J1 = 6.0 Hz, J2 = 5.6 Hz, 2H), 2.80 (t, J1 = 5.2 Hz, J2 = 5.6 Hz, 2H), 1.88–1.83 (m, 4H), 1.45 (t, J = 7.2 Hz, 3H). The corresponding 1H NMR spectrum is shown in Fig. S1.†

2.3 Device fabrication
The structure of fabricated PSCs was FTO/TiO2/perovskite/(with or without HQTh-EC)/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag under an air environment without a glovebox. The FTO glasses were cleaned with acetone, absolute ethyl alcohol and IPA for 15 minutes each with sequential ultrasonic treatment. Then the ultraviolet (UV)–ozone cleaner treated the precleaned FTO glasses for 15 minutes. For the electron-transport layer (ETL), the compact TiO2 layer was spin-coated on the FTO substrates (4000 revolutions per minute (rpm), 20 s) and then annealed at increasing temperature (up to 450 °C with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1) for 30 minutes. PbI2 (318 mg) and MAI (108 mg) were added in DMF (0.513 mL) and DMSO (0.027 mL) and stirred at 60 °C for 0.5 h to obtain a pale-yellow MAPbI3 precursor solution. The perovskite precursor solution (0.08 mL) was spin-coated on the TiO2 substrate at 2000 rpm for 10 s and 4000 rpm for 25 s, successively. Ethyl acetate (0.275 mL), as an anti-solvent, was dropped onto the substrate in the last 17 s. Then, the perovskite was immediately annealed at 100 °C for 30 minutes. The HQTh-EC passivation layer was deposited after cooling down to room temperature. 1, 2.5, and 5 mg mL−1 HQTh-EC solutions (dissolved in chlorobenzene) were spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s followed by annealing at 80 °C for 1 h. The solution of the hole-transport layer (HTL), spiro-OMeTAD (72.3 mg spiro-OMeTAD powder), 17.5 μL of Li-TFSI solution (520 mg mL−1 Li-TFSI dissolved in acetonitrile) and 29 μL TBP all mixed in 1 mL chlorobenzene was spin-coated at a rate of 4000 rpm for 30 s without annealing. Finally, 80 nm thick Ag was fabricated as the top electrode.
2.4 Characterization
Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Ultra55, ZEISS, Germany), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Al K Alpha, USA), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD, Thermo ARL-X'TRA, USA) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (JASCO FT/IR-6100 spectrophotometer), UV-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy (UV-vis spectrophotometer (Lambda 900, America)) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS, ESCALAB Xi+) were employed to analyze the morphology and microstructure of the perovskite film. Photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) were recorded using a PG2000-Pro-EX spectrophotometer (Shanghai Ideaoptics Corporation) and transient fluorescence spectrometer (FLS980, Edinburgh Instruments), respectively. The 1H NMR spectrum was recorded on a Mercury plus 400 MHz NMR spectrometer in CDCl3 with tetramethylsilane (TMS; d = 0 ppm) as the internal standard. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PSCs were measured using a Keithley 2400-SCS source meter under AM 1.5 illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The device active area was defined to be 0.06 cm2. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of the PSCs were carried out using an electrochemical workstation (Zennium Pro, Germany).
3. Results and discussion
The dye interfacial material, ethyl-2-((6-hydroxyquinolin-5-yl)diazenyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzo[b]thiophene-3-carboxylate (abbreviated as HQTh-EC), was designed and synthesized by the diazotization reaction and coupling reaction, as presented in Fig. 1a and b. The normalized ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectrum of the HQTh-EC solution (dissolved in chlorobenzene) is displayed in Fig. S2.† The absorption band of the HQTh-EC was located in the region of 250–600 nm, and it served as a protective layer on the perovskite against the reflected UV light from the top opaque Ag electrode22 to suppress the intrinsic degradation, ultimately making a contribution to the long-term stability of PSCs. Meanwhile, the electrostatic potential (ESP) was calculated by the density functional theory (DFT) method at the level of B3LYP with the 6-31G basis set. As shown in the ESP map in Fig. S3,† HQTh-EC exhibited a planar π-conjugated molecular backbone. To show the electron distribution of HQTh-EC, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) are presented in Fig. 1c. The HOMO and LUMO of HQTh-EC showed that the electron distribution was almost delocalized over the whole molecular skeleton, causing HQTh-EC to be more easily assembled at the perovskite GBs. This was crucial for the influence of the passivation effect in PSCs.23
The fabricated PSCs with HQTh-EC had a structure of glass/FTO/TiO2/perovskite/HQTh-EC/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag, as shown in Fig. 2a. The current–voltage curves of the PSCs with various concentrations of HQTh-EC are displayed in Fig. 2b. It was clear that the optimized concentration of HQTh-EC for a high efficiency device was 2.5 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene. To make certain that such improvement was a universal feature, we measured the PCE values of 30 PSCs with and without HQTh-EC to construct a statistical diagram as shown in Fig. 2c. The 2.5 mg mL−1 HQTh-EC-treated device exhibited a higher average PCE of 19.87% with more excellent reproducibility, compared with the control device (16.37%). Therefore, 2.5 mg mL−1 of HQTh-EC was selected as the optimal concentration in the subsequent analyses.

(d) The J–V characteristic curves under different scan directions, (e) comparison of steady-state power output and (f) the IPCE spectra of the PSCs with and without HQTh-EC modification. 
As shown in Fig. 2d, the highly efficient solar cell with HQTh-EC exhibited a high PCE of 20.08% under reverse scan conditions (with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 23.14 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.11 V and a fill factor (FF) of 78.21%) and a PCE of 19.85% under forward scan conditions. The control device without HQTh-EC had a PCE of 16.73% under reverse scan conditions (with a JSC of 21.42 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.06 V and an FF of 73.69%) and a PCE of 15.77% under forward scan conditions. The corresponding photovoltaic performance parameters are summarized in Table 1. The incorporation of HQTh-EC resulted in a dramatic improvement in PCE, mainly in JSC and VOC, which might be ascribed to the superior charge transport properties, the appropriate energy level alignment and the passivation of surface defects.24 Meanwhile, it was found from Fig. 2d that the hysteresis index (defined as HI (%) = (PCEreverse − PCEforward)/PCEreverse × 100) of the PSCs was evidently reduced from 3.71 to 1.07 after the incorporation of HQTh-EC. The reduced hysteresis was related to the effective defect passivation and ion migration suppression at the surface and grain boundaries of the perovskite films.23

The stabilized PCE and the maximum steady-state photocurrent were measured under a maximum power point of 1.04 V for 300 s to examine the stabilized power output (SPO) of the optimal HQTh-EC-treated device, as exhibited in Fig. 2e. The PSCs passivated by HQTh-EC achieved a stable PCE (19.85%) and a stable current density (22.86 mA cm−2). For the control PSCs, the stabilized current density at 0.98 V was 20.66 mA cm−2, and the steady-state PCE was 16.11%, which was close to the PCE obtained from the J–V curves. Moreover, the enhancement in JSC was verified by incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements (Fig. 2f), revealing that the HQTh-EC-modified device exhibited better IPCE responses ranging from 400 to 750 nm. Above all, the HQTh-EC modification not only improved the JSC but also helped to reduce the hysteresis, which was due to minimized trap states of perovskite films and reduced interfacial carrier accumulation.
For the HQTh-EC surface passivation mechanism on the perovskite, we predicted that the undercoordinated Pb defects were passivated by the carbonyl group in HQTh-EC, and the corresponding schematic is demonstrated in Fig. 3a. To confirm this, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy measurements were conducted, as displayed in Fig. 3b. For the pristine perovskite film, no peak was observed in the range of 1700 to 1800 cm−1. Obviously, the FTIR spectrum of the HQTh-EC film showed that the stretching vibration of the CO bond (1799 cm−1) shifted to a lower wavenumber (1795 cm−1) upon interaction with the perovskite, which indicated that the CO bond interacted with some components of the perovskite (undercoordinated Pb defects). To further identify the passivation effect of HQTh-EC, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed. As depicted in Fig. 3c, the Pb 4f spectrum of the pristine perovskite film displayed two main peaks at 137.88 and 142.78 eV assigned to Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2, which were higher than those of the perovskite films with HQTh-EC (137.68 eV and 142.58 eV). The blue-shifted binding energy of the Pb 4f core level for the perovskite film with HQTh-EC indicated the change of surrounding electron cloud density,25 which was ascribed to the strong Lewis acid–base interaction between HQTh-EC and Pb2+ of the perovskite.26 In addition, two shoulders of the perovskite at 141.01 and 136.13 eV were observed and corresponded to the Pb0 defects. After modification with HQTh-EC, the peak intensity of uncoordinated Pb ions decreased, indicating that the defects were passivated due to the interaction between HQTh-EC and the perovskite film.

To study the reasons for the efficiency enhancement of PSCs after HQTh-EC modification, the morphologies, structures, and properties of the perovskite films were tested. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurement was performed to evaluate the morphology change of the perovskite films with and without HQTh-EC treatment, as shown in Fig. 4a and b. After HQTh-EC modification, the grain sizes of all perovskite films displayed a negligible change and the average crystalline grain size was ≈350 nm, as exhibited in the statistical histogram of the grain size (Fig. S4†). Nevertheless, it was clear that the morphology of the perovskite film with the HQTh-EC treatment was more smooth and denser without obvious pinholes compared with that of the pristine perovskite film. As displayed in Fig. 4c and d, the cross-sectional SEM images of the perovskite with and without HQTh-EC further verify the optimized effect of HQTh-EC on the morphology of the perovskite film. The MAPbI3 perovskite film demonstrated a thickness of ≈500 nm. And the HQTh-EC layer was additionally formed on the surface of the perovskite layer, which strengthened the hydrophobicity of the perovskite film, which was verified by the water contact angle images (Fig. S5†). The water-contact-angle of the pristine perovskite film was 47.04° and then increased to 80.52° for the HQTh-EC-modified perovskite film. The HQTh-EC-modified perovskite film displayed a larger angle, indicating the improved moisture resistance ability. Given that HQTh-EC modification induced non prominent changes in the grain size, the optimized performance was closely linked to the increased hydrophobicity of the perovskite.

In addition, the light absorption characteristic of the perovskite was found to be responsible for the origin of enhanced JSC. As illustrated in Fig. 4e, the normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of the perovskite films were recorded. Obviously, all films had a similar absorption edge, indicating that the surface treatment of HQTh-EC had a negligible effect on the band gap of the perovskite, while in a short wavelength range, stronger absorbance intensity was observed for the perovskite film with HQTh-EC compared with the control perovskite film, which was likely attributed to the additional sunlight absorption of HQTh-EC (Fig. S2†) and the good compactness with reduced defects.27,28
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out to further investigate the effect of HQTh-EC treatment on the film quality, as displayed in Fig. 4f. The peaks of the perovskite film with and without HQTh-EC are located at 14.2°, 28.51° and 31.95°, corresponding to (110), (220) and (310), respectively. And minor peaks from the (100) and (200) planes could be observed at 20.15°, 23.61°, 24.63° and 35.08°, which were assigned to the planes (112), (211), (202) and (204) of the perovskite crystal structure, respectively. After the HQTh-EC modification, the perovskite film displayed slightly increased peak intensity and no peaks shifted, implying that the interaction between HQTh-EC and the perovskite could effectively assist in improving the perovskite crystal and passivating defects but not participating in the formation of the perovskite lattice.29
To obtain insights on the synergistic passivation and charge transport effect, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements of the perovskite films with or without HQTh-EC were conducted, as shown in Fig. 5a and b. The perovskite film was spin-coated on the FTO/TiO2 substrate. The bottom ETL had a very little effect on the photogenerated carriers when the laser was incident from the perovskite side. The electron transfer to the ETL and the hole extraction process are more efficient, resulting in the quenching of the PL intensity.30 As demonstrated in Fig. 5a, the PL peak intensity of the perovskite/HQTh-EC film was noticeably reduced compared with that of the control film, implying more effective carrier transport.30,31 The PL peak presented a blue-shift from 766 nm to 764 nm, suggesting lower electron trap-state density for the perovskite.32Fig. 5b shows the TRPL spectra of the perovskite films with and without HQTh-EC. And the TRPL decay curve was fitted by a double exponential decay function, as shown below. (1)

The average decay lifetime could be calculated using the following equation: (2)where A1 and A2 are the corresponding decay amplitude. τ1 is the fast decay lifetime component and τ2 is the slow decay lifetime component. The fitted parameters are listed in Table 2. For the perovskite film on the FTO/TiO2 substrate, the pristine perovskite film had an average lifetime of 137.23 ns, while that of the perovskite film modified by HQTh-EC decreased to 24.44 ns. The reduced lifetime indicated that the carrier extraction and transport of the perovskite film were accelerated, promoting electron transport to the TiO2 layer,33 which was consistent with the PL results. That was to say, the HQTh-EC interlayer treatment could enhance the charge transport of PSCs.

The interfacial charge-transfer kinetics and the trap-assisted recombination phenomena of the devices were further verified by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. As illustrated in Fig. 5c, the Nyquist plots of the devices based on perovskite with and without HQTh-EC were measured under dark conditions. The fitting results are listed in Table S1.† The inset in Fig. 5c revealed the equivalent circuit model, consisting of the fitting internal series resistance (Rs) and charge transfer resistance (Rct), which were related to the junction capacitance and recombination resistance of the interfaces between the transport layer and perovskite layer. The Rct value of the PSC with HQTh-EC increased dramatically compared with that of the pristine one, indicating that HQTh-EC interfacial modification promoted interfacial charge transfer and suppressed carrier recombination in the perovskite/HTL interface,34 conducive to the improvement of VOC and FF, which was in good agreement with the reduced trap state density mentioned above.
To quantify the trap state density of the perovskite, space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) measurements were carried out for the electron-only device with an architecture of FTO/TiO2/perovskite/(with and without HQTh-EC)/PC61BM/Ag and the hole-only device with an architecture of FTO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/(with and without HQTh-EC)/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag, as shown in Fig. 5d, e and S6.† With the increase of the applied voltage, the current increased sharply, a trap-filled limit (TFL) region could be observed, and at the first kink point, the voltage applied was defined as the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL).35 When the VTFL was used to calculate the trap-state density (Nt) via the following equation:36 (3)where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, and ε is the relative dielectric constant of MAPbI3 (ε = 32), e is the electron charge, and L is the thickness of the perovskite film.37 According to the cross-sectional SEM images, the thicknesses were approximately 500 nm for all perovskite films. The calculated electron and hole trap densities are shown in Fig. S7.† For the electron-only device, the Nt values of the perovskite film without and with HQTh-EC were calculated to be 5.68 × 1015 cm−3 and 2.79 × 1015 cm−3. Moreover, the Nt of pristine perovskite of the hole-only device was 9.12 × 1015 cm−3, while the perovskite/HQTh-EC film presented a relatively lower Nt of 5.63 × 1015 cm−3. The decreased defect density was due to the surface passivation effectiveness of HQTh-EC for the perovskite film, which was consistent with the PL analysis.
Besides, the mobility (μ) of the perovskite in the SCLC regime was calculated using the following equation: (4)where J is the current density, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, ε is the dielectric constant, μ is the mobility and V is the trap-filling limit voltage. The electron mobility of the control perovskite film was measured to be 2.06 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 S−1, while after the HQTh-EC modification, the mobility was increased to 1.57 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 S−1. The hole mobility of the perovskite film without and with HQTh-EC was calculated to 5.69 × 10−3 and 3.06 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 S−1, which indicated that the incorporation of HQTh-EC could enhance charge extraction and hole transportation. Both the reduced trap density and increased mobility confirmed the effect of HQTh-EC on defect passivation and charge transfer. The faster carrier extraction and transfer would accelerate charge transmission, which contributed to the improvement of the VOC of PSCs.38,39
The improved average VOC of the HQTh-EC-based device could be attributed to the minimized trap-assisted recombination as revealed by the light dependence of the VOC (Fig. 5f). The relationship between light intensity and VOC was based on the following equation:38 (5)where n is an ideal factor, K is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature and e is the elementary charge. From the curves in Fig. 5f, it was found that the slope of the device with HQTh-EC-passivated perovskite was 1.27kT/e, which was lower than that of the pristine device (1.75kT/e). A slope close to 1kT/e meant that the additional trap-assisted Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination was suppressed,40 which was beneficial for the enhancements of VOC and FF. Therefore, this result highlighted that the HQTh-EC interface modification layer could effectively reduce the energy loss and the trap-assisted recombination under open-circuit conditions, as well as substantially increasing charge extraction.
The influence of HQTh-EC modification on the energy band alignment of the MAPbI3 film was further investigated to obtain a further understanding of the interfacial charge transport performance. The electrochemical properties of the materials were studied by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). As demonstrated in Fig. 6a, the work function (WF) with respect to vacuum determined from the secondary electron cut-off was 4.27 eV, and after HQTh-EC modification, it increased to 4.33 eV. The valence band maximum (VBM) was also studied relative to the Fermi level (EF). For the control film and modified film, the VBM was located below 1.19 and 1.05 eV, respectively (Fig. 6b). In view of the UPS results and the unchanged Eg (Fig. 4e, 1.57 eV) after HQTh-EC modification, the energy-band diagram (Fig. 6c) revealed that the valence band of the perovskite was appropriate with that of the HQTh-EC interlayer, reducing the energy-level barrier between CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite and the HTL (spiro-OMeTAD), which resulted in more efficient interfacial charge extraction and increased VOC and JSC.41

As is known, the ambient stability of the perovskite film is very important for long-term storage of PSCs. We carried out a systematic study of the degeneration of the perovskite films with and without HQTh-EC under dark conditions (70–80% RH) for different times (Fig. 7). The degradation morphology of the perovskite film is depicted in Fig. 7a. The change in color was a direct signal of perovskite film decomposition. The pristine perovskite film gradually turned from dark to yellow and degraded to PbI2. The passivated perovskite/HQTh-EC film showed almost no change, implying that degeneration was suppressed under the same process conditions, which was in good agreement with the water-contact-angle images (Fig. S5†).

To understand the crystal structural evolution in open air, XRD measurements were conducted under 70–80% RH conditions in the dark. It can be seen from the XRD patterns (Fig. 7b and c) that the pristine perovskite films presented a noticeable PbI2 peak at 12.6° after being stored for 100 h, and the intensity of the PbI2 peak increased after being kept for 400 h. The stronger PbI2 peak intensity indicated that the pristine perovskite film was highly decomposed. However, for the HQTh-EC-passivated perovskite film, a much low PbI2 peak could be detected and the intensity of the PbI2 peak showed no significant change when it was stored for 100 h and 400 h, suggesting the inhibited decomposition of the perovskite.42
The PCEs of unencapsulated PSCs with and without HQTh-EC stored at RH 70–80% at room temperature for 400 h in the dark were measured. As demonstrated in Fig. 7d, the normalized PCE of the HQTh-EC-modified device still retained 86% of its initial value, which was stabler than that of the control one, which maintained just 15% under the same conditions. Therefore, it was confirmed that the HQTh-EC as a dye interfacial modification layer could further enhance the PCE and long-term stability of the device, consequently advancing the PSC commercialization.
4. Conclusion
In summary, we introduced a multifunctional HQTh-EC interlayer to remarkably improve the performance and stability of PSCs simultaneously. The π-conjugated intrinsic characteristic of HQTh-EC and well-matched energy level alignment could facilitate charge carrier transport between the perovskite absorber layer and the spiro-OMeTAD layer. The HQTh-EC interfacial modification layer could also passivate the undercoordinated Pb defects and surface defects, reducing the defect intensity and the charge carrier recombination. Both these effects and the enhanced sunlight absorption by the HQTh-EC contributed to the enhanced PCE of the device after adopting the HQTh-EC dye interlayer. As a result, the HQTh-EC passivated PSCs achieved an improved champion PCE of 20.08% compared with that of the control PSCs (16.73%). The HQTh-EC-treated PSCs retained 86% of the initial PCE after 400 h storage at room temperature with RH 70–80%, indicating their long-term stability. This work presented a meaningful insight for using dye passivation layers to modify perovskite films, and provided a new pathway for the fabrication of high-performance and high-stability PSCs under open air without a glovebox.
