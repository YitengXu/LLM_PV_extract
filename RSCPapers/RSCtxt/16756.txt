    , Accepted 22nd March 2021First published on 24th March 2021AbstractWe report the synthesis of new visible-light photosensitizers derived from purpurin (mono-allyl- and triallyl-purpurin), and their use as type II photoinitiating systems when associated with N-methyldiethanolamine, bis(4-methylphenyl) iodonium hexafluorophosphate or tri-functionalized thiol (trimethylolpropane tris(3-mercaptopropionate)) for cationic and free-radical photopolymerization, and the initiation of thiol–ene reactions. These photoinitiating systems showed good initiating properties in laminate or under air upon visible-light exposure, i.e. LED@405 nm, 455 nm, 470 nm, 530 nm, and a Xe lamp. Steady-state photolysis, electron paramagnetic resonance, fluorescence analysis and laser flash photolysis have clearly highlighted the photochemical properties of the different photoinitiating systems and proved that purpurin derivatives could act as electron donors or as proton/proton-coupled electron transfer promoters when associated with appropriate additives. For the first time, we also demonstrated the capability of triallyl purpurin to produce newly designed 3D objects by 3D photoprinting technology. Interestingly, the photosensitizers from new 3D materials incorporating triallyl-purpurin have undoubtedly shown tremendous antibacterial properties with more than 99% of inhibition of bacterial adhesion upon visible-light exposure, even after many antibacterial cycling experiments, thus showing their capability to be recycled.
Introduction
In the past few decades, photo-driven reactions have attracted great interest in many chemistry domains, and become the cornerstone of a large number of applications in microelectronics, adhesives, flooring, paving applications, photoresist technology, and dentistry, and in the synthesis of novel biomaterials or 3D micro/nano objects.1,2
Photon-initiated chemical reactions have become undoubtedly an indispensable process for the synthesis of original materials as they offer many striking advantages3 over the thermal process including spatial control of the polymerization, low temperature and solvent-free conditions, reduction of the reaction time, control of the overall properties of photo-crosslinking materials, productivity increase and reduction of manufacturing costs using cheap, and new generation light sources4 (i.e. light-emitting and laser diodes with visible or IR light emission). However, some main limitations can be pointed out such as oxygen-induced inhibition in free-radical photopolymerization5 (FRP) or the use of harmful UV-light irradiation for the activation of petro-sourced photo-initiators.6 The handling of safety issues and the high energy consumption associated with UV-light emitting sources have led to the development of new performing visible-light photoactive systems4,7 to overcome previously described drawbacks. Both photocleavable Norrish type I and type II systems, acting in the visible or IR range, have thus been designed by molecular engineering;8 their structures and photo-initiating properties have been extensively reviewed. However, the use of natural products as photoinitiators addressing both the environmental and safety concerns has somewhat been limited until now. The investigations on natural products as potential photo-initiators are scarce despite their potential for cutting off the synthesis costs of petro-sourced photo-initiators. Nevertheless, the first reports mentioning the use of riboflavin as a free-radical photoinitiator of acrylic monomers9,10 were reported in the sixties, followed 40 years later by some outstanding studies describing the photo-initiating properties of curcumin in the polymerization of styrene,11 and in the cationic photopolymerization (CP) of a variety of oxetane, epoxides, vinyl monomers12 or epoxidized soybean oil.13 In the same way, quercetin which is one of the most abundant flavones, was used for the first time as a photosensitizer for the cationic photopolymerization of glycerol triglycidyl ether.14 Recently, paprika, a carotenoid complex derivative, was employed as a visible-light photosensitizer for the free-radical photoinduced cationic photopolymerization (FRPCP) of a gallic-derived epoxy bio-based monomer.15 Surprisingly, the largest class of naturally occurring quinones like purpurin and purpurin derivatives has been scarcely investigated as visible-light absorbing photosensitizers despite their high absorption properties in the visible range. Purpurin16–18 is a crude madder extract and one of the main anthraquinone-type dyes discovered in the roots and tubers of Rubia tinctorum, R. peregrine, R. cordifolia, and R. munjista. The limited studies describing the use of purpurin derivatives as visible-light photosensitizers for FRP or CP prompted us to design novel purpurin structures.
The originality of these new purpurin derived photosensitizers lies in their capability to be used as (i) visible-light absorbing photosensitizers for FRP and CP when wisely associated with co-initiators, (ii) they can be used to design 3D objects by a 3D photoprinting technique in a reduced time, (iii) these derivatives could be covalently attached to the polymer network due to the presence of the allyl photopolymerizable functionality and can be used as (iv) photoactive antimicrobial agents since they produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) under visible-light activation.
In this study, two purpurin derivatives (mono-allylated purpurin (PmA) and tri-allylated purpurin (PA)) are synthesized and their photochemical behavior in comparison with that of the native purpurin (P) is evaluated under LED@385, 405, 455, 470 and 530 nm irradiation. The photoinitiating performances of both purpurin derivatives as photosensitizers for FRP or CP and the thiol–ene process are investigated by real-time FTIR-spectroscopy and compared with that of the native purpurin. The photochemical mechanism details will be evidenced by steady-state photolysis, nanosecond laser flash spectroscopy, and fluorescence and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments. In addition, and for the first time, the design of new 3D objects by the 3D photoprinting technology from a tri-allylated purpurin (PA) derivative will be demonstrated. This is of great importance for the design of further complex antibacterial devices. Finally, a new photoactive antimicrobial material derived from PA was tested against the adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) under visible-light exposure after three antibacterial cycling experiments. The idea is to prove the reusability/recycling of our material and its antimicrobial performance against the adhesion of S. aureus, even after many antimicrobial tests.
Experimental
Materials
Purpurin (1,2,4-trihydroxyanthraquinone, P), 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl 3,4-epoxycyclohexylcarboxylate (EPOX), soybean oil epoxidized acrylate (HEA), trimethylolpropane tris(3-mercaptopropionate) (Trithiol, TT, >95%), bis(4-methylphenyl)iodonium hexafluorophosphate (Iod), 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA), tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB), 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-1-nitrosobenzene (nitrosodurene, ND), N-tert-butyl-α-phenylnitrone (PBN) and 5,5-dimethyl-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO, distilled prior to the application) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) from Sartomer. N-Methyldiethanolamine (>98%, MDEA) and allyl bromide (99%, stab. with 300–1000 ppm propylene oxide) were given by Alfa Aesar. Molecular sieves (3 Å), silica gel, ethyl acetate (EtOAc), cyclohexane (CyH), and diethyl ether (Et2O) were obtained from Aldrich. 9,10-Anthraquinone (AQ) and benzophenone (BP) were provided by Alfa Aesar and Fluka, respectively.
Synthesis of allyl purpurin derivatives (PmA and PA)
Allyl purpurin derivatives were synthesized by microwave irradiation under non-conventional phase transfer catalysis conditions.19 Purpurin (P) (190 mg, 0.7 mmol, 1 equiv.) was incorporated into a powder blend of NaOH (90 mg, 2.5 mmol, 3 equiv.), K2CO3 (1.25 g, 9 mmol, 12 equiv.) and TBAB (75 mg, 0.23 mmol, 0.3 equiv.). Into a microwave tube (20 mL) containing allyl bromide (6 mL, 46 equiv.), the resulting mixture was progressively added under agitation. The reaction was then carried out at 85 °C for 1 hour after which the sample was left to cool. The reacting solution was transferred into a separating funnel with 100 mL of deionized water and extracted with Et2O (3 × 50 mL). The organic phase was successively washed twice, dried under MgSO4 and concentrated by vacuum evaporation. The final mixture was purified by silica gel chromatography (SiO2, CyH/EtOAc 80/20) and two fractions were collected. The first fraction corresponds to the mono-allylated derivative PmA (10% yield, red powder), whereas the other fraction, a red oil (40% yield), was referred to as the tri-allylated purpurin PA.

Characterization

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance II instrument at 400 MHz and 100 MHz, respectively. 1D and 2D NMR experiments were performed in CDCl3. UV-vis spectra were obtained on a PerkinElmer Lambda 2 UV–vis spectrophotometer in the 200–800 nm wavelength range at room temperature.
Steady-state photolysis
Steady state photolysis experiments were performed under air with a LED@405 nm (M405L3-C4-Thorlab, 44 mW cm−2) in ACN. The photolysis of the purpurin derivatives was studied in the absence and in the presence of additives (Iod, MDEA, TT). Qualitative measurements of photoacid production were performed by the addition of rhodamine B (RhB) as previously described.20
Irradiation sources
Photopolymerizations were carried out with a conventional polychromatic xenon lamp (Hamamatsu, Lightningcure LC8-03, xenon lamp, 200 W, 60 mW cm−2) and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) from Thorlabs (Newton, NJ, USA) with different emission wavelengths: LED@385 nm (44 mW cm−2), LED@405 nm (60 mW cm−2), LED@455 nm (38 mW cm−2), LED@470 nm (25 mW cm−2) and LED@530 nm (14 mW cm−2).
Photopolymerization kinetic studies
The kinetic profiles of photocurable formulations were investigated by real-time Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (RT-FTIR, Jasco FT-IR 4700). To monitor the progress of the reactions, the photosensitive formulations were spread on a BaF2 pellet and irradiated under air or laminate conditions with the above-mentioned LED sources. Acrylate or epoxy conversions were calculated by RT-FTIR by following the decrease of the acrylate or epoxy absorbance at 1640 and 790 cm−1, respectively. The thickness of the photosensitive layer was estimated at 25 μm for all samples.
Cyclic voltammetry
The cyclic voltammograms of the purpurin derivatives were recorded with an AUTOLAB potentiometer/galvanometer employing GPES electrochemical software version 4.9 (Utrecht, The Netherlands). Substrates were introduced in a conventional three-electrode cell containing NBuBF4 solution (acetonitrile, 0.1 mM) at 1 mM concentration. After performing an argon purge step, electrochemical measurements were carried out with a glassy carbon working electrode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and a gold wire as a counter electrode as previously described.19,20
Laser flash photolysis (LFP)
A laser flash photolysis study was carried out using a Spectra Physics GCR-150-30 Nd:YAG laser at 355 nm with 7 ns impulsion time and a computer-controlled system which has been previously described in detail.20 Analyses were conducted in a quartz cell (thickness = 1 cm) containing purpurin derivative solution ([P] = 3.7 × 10−4 M, [PmA] = 3.8 × 10−4 M and [PA] = 2.1 × 10−4 M) which is degassed under argon for 10 min prior to LFP experiments.
Fluorescence studies
Fluorescence measurements were performed with a PerkinElmer Lambda 2 spectrometer and spectra were recorded using a FluoroMax-4 spectrofluorometer.
EPR experiments
EPR spectra in the X-band (modulation frequency of 100 kHz) were recorded by means of an EMXplus spectrometer (Bruker) with the High Sensitivity Probe-head (Bruker) using thin-walled quartz EPR tubes. The solutions prepared in benzene carefully saturated with argon were irradiated at 293 K directly in an EPR resonator using a LED@400 nm source (λmax = 400 nm; Bluepoint LED, Hönle UV Technology) or LED@450 nm radiation (KL1600LED, Schott, blue filter), and EPR spectra were recorded in situ during/after defined exposure as described previously in ref. 20. The experimental EPR spectra were analyzed using WinEPR software (Bruker) and the calculations of simulated spectra were performed with the EasySpin toolbox working on the MatLab® platform.21 The detailed information on the EPR spectrometer settings is given in the figure captions.
Film preparation for antibacterial tests
The formulation containing EPOX/HEA (50%/50% w/w) in the presence of PA/Iod (0.5%/2.5% w/w) was poured into a silicon mould (1.5 cm × 2.5 cm × 0.3 cm) and irradiated for 4 min under air with LED@405 nm.
Singlet oxygen formation
The generation of singlet oxygen species was demonstrated by visible-light irradiation of PA in solution. The yield of the generated singlet oxygen was calculated in comparison with that generated by rose bengal (RB).13 RB was used as a standard photosensitizer (Φsinglet oxygen (RB) = 0.68 in ethanol).
Antibacterial assays
The antibacterial properties of purpurin derived films under visible-light irradiation were evaluated against S. aureus ATCC6538. Experiments were done according to a previously described procedure.13–15 The aim of the experiment is to evaluate the reusability of the films as antimicrobial materials.
3D printing experiments
A 3D photosensitive formulation containing TT (20 wt%)/TMPTA (80 wt%)/PA (0.5 wt%) was printed using an Asiga PICO 2 DLP printer with a nominal XY resolution of 39 μm, using a diode as a light-emitting source (405 nm; intensity 35 mW cm−2). Printing parameters were experimentally set as follows: (a) a layer thickness of 60 μm and (b) a layer exposure time of 2.4 s. A post curing process was performed for 5 min with a medium-pressure mercury lamp at a low intensity (12 mW cm−2, Robot Factory).
Results and discussion
The overall synthesis procedure for the synthesis of PmA and PA is shown in Scheme 1. The NMR characterization of the resulting purpurin derivatives is described in the ESI (Fig. S1–S7†). Actually, the synthesis of purpurin derivatives was carried out according to the Williamson reaction.22 This synthesis occurred under microwave irradiation, using an allyl bromide, in the presence of nucleophilic bases. After 1 h reaction at 85 °C, the crude product was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel; 40% of the purified product corresponds to the tri-allylated purpurin (PA), and 10% is attributed to the mono-allylated purpurin (PmA). 1H NMR spectra of PmA and PA confirmed the success of the reactions in the presence of one and three allyl groups per purpurin moiety, respectively. The 1H signals between 4.5 and 6.2 ppm are assigned to the protons of the allyl groups19 of PmA and PA.

Light absorption properties of P, PmA and PA
The UV-vis absorption spectrum of PA shows an intense absorption band located in the UV-visible range from 350 to 550 nm and centered at ca. 400 nm (Fig. 1). In contrast to P or PmA, the addition of allyl groups on the purpurin structure leads to a hypsochromic shift. Interestingly, the UV-vis absorption spectra of PA (λmax = 401 nm, εmax ∼ 9600 M−1 cm−1) and PmA (λmax = 480 nm, εmax ∼ 6950 M−1 cm−1) show a higher molar absorption coefficient than that of purpurin (P, λmax = 477 nm, εmax = 5974 M−1 cm−1). The overlaps between the UV-vis absorption spectra of PA or PmA and the emission spectra of LED@405, 455, 470 and 530 nm make them very interesting as novel visible-light photosensitizers. Therefore, our attention is now focused on the reactivity of the new purpurin derivatives in combination with different additives i.e. MDEA, Iod and TT. Their photochemical reactivity has been studied by EPR spin-trapping upon LED irradiation, and by fluorescence and laser flash photolysis experiments. All the photochemical properties of the purpurin derivatives in combination with the co-initiators (Iod, MDEA or TT) are summarized in Table S1.†

Photoreactivity of P, PmA and PA/Iod photoiniating systems
No EPR signals were found upon continuous in situ LED@450 nm photoexcitation of P/Iod/benzene solutions under argon, reflecting the limited lifetime of the photogenerated species. Consequently, the EPR spin trapping technique was applied to monitor the generation of the (4-methyl)phenyl radical, using various spin trapping agents, i.e., DMPO – a cyclic nitrone, PBN as the most reactive open-chain nitrone, and ND – a nitroso spin trap, allowing the more detailed structure assignment of the trapped carbon-centered radical.23
Experimental EPR spectra recorded upon LED@450 nm irradiation of P/Iod/DMPO or P/Iod/PBN in benzene under argon along with their simulations are shown in Fig. S8.† The simulation analysis evidenced the trapping of the (4-methyl)phenyl radical and the formation of six-line signals of ˙DMPO-phenyl(4-methyl) or ˙PBN-phenyl(4-methyl) spin-adducts as the dominant spectral components. The spin-Hamiltonian parameters of the (4-methyl)phenyl radical DMPO and PBN spin-adducts elucidated from the simulations of experimental EPR spectra are summarized in Table S2.† The analogous EPR spectra of (4-methyl)phenyl radical spin-adducts were found upon LED@450 nm exposure of PmA/Iod/DMPO, PmA/Iod/PBN and PmA/Iod/ND (Fig. S9 and S10†), as well as LED@400 nm irradiation of PA/Iod/DMPO and PA/Iod/PBN (Fig. 2) in benzene solutions under argon. Additionally, for both DMPO and PBN spin trapping agents, the signal of the (4-methyl)phenyl adduct is superimposed with a six-line signal of another carbon-centered radical spin-adduct characterized by slightly altered spin-Hamiltonian parameters, i.e., ˙DMPO-CR (aN = 1.441 ± 0.003 mT, aβH = 2.061 ± 0.004 mT; g = 2.0061 ± 0.0001) or ˙PBN-CR (aN = 1.450 ± 0.005 mT, aβH = 0.354 ± 0.002 mT; g = 2.0061 ± 0.0001), and the relative concentration of these spin-adducts increased upon prolonged exposure. The photoexcitation of PA/Iod/ND (LED@400 nm) resulted in the exclusive generation of a ˙ND-phenyl(4-methyl) spin-adduct, and the monitored high-resolution experimental spectrum along with its simulation is shown in Fig. S11.†

Insets show the structure of phenyl(4-methyl) radical adducts with DMPO or PBN as the dominant spectral components assigned from the simulated EPR spectrum. 
These results are further confirmed indirectly under light irradiation by steady-state photolysis, fluorescence and LFP experiments. As described in Fig. S12–S14,† the addition of Iod to purpurin derivatives leads to a decrease of their visible absorption band upon LED@405 nm irradiation, demonstrating a synergistic interaction. Another interesting feature is the formation of Brønsted acids H+ after the photolysis of purpurin derivatives/Iod systems according to a previously described test involving rhodamine B; indeed, H+ is captured by rhodamine B, leading to an increase of the 550 nm absorbance of the acid form of rhodamine B.13 The fluorescence properties of both P, PmA and PA and their quenching by Iod are shown in Fig. S15.†P, PmA and PA show fluorescence at 575 nm, 575 nm and 560 nm, respectively. The fluorescence quenching constants KSV of P, PmA and PA by Iod were found to be at 40 M−1, 3 M−1 and 9.5 M−1, (Fig. S15†) and highlight a possible electron transfer reaction between the singlet excited states of purpurin derivatives and Iod. The negative free energy changes of P, PmA and PA with Iod (i.e. ΔGS (P/Iod) = −0.61 eV, ΔGS (PmA/Iod) = −0.43 eV and ΔGS (PA/Iod) = −0.24 eV) calculated from the Rehm–Weller equation24 using the oxidation potentials (Eox(P) = 1.35 V, Eox(PmA) = 1.53 V and Eox(PA) = 1.77 V measured by cyclic voltammetry; see the ESI, Fig. S16†), the reduction potential of Iod (ERed,Iod = −0.2 V) and the excited singlet state energies of the purpurin derivatives (ES,P = 2.16 eV, ES,PmA = 2.16 eV and ES,PA = 2.21 eV extracted from the emission fluorescence spectra) are in full agreement with an electron transfer reaction from 1P* (1PmA* or 1PA*) to Iod. Interestingly, the triplet excited lifetime of P, PmA and PA decreased after the addition of Iod. Several triplet state absorption peaks for P, PmA and PA have been clearly observed at 410, 500 or 560 nm (see Fig. S17†). The bimolecular rate constants for the quenching of 3P*, 3PmA* and 3PA* by Iod (i.e. kIodq (3P*), kIodq (3PmA*) and kIodq (3PA*)) have been calculated from the plot of the slope of the inverse triplet lifetime vs. Iod concentration (see ESI, Fig. S18†). Therefore, kIodq (3PmA*) = 5 ± 0.8 × 109 M−1 s−1 (at 410 nm) and kIodq (3PA*) = 1.1 ± 0.2 × 108 M−1 s−1 at 560 nm (ESI, Fig. S18†), thus demonstrating an electron transfer reaction between 3PmA* or 3PA* and the ground state of Iod, in contrast to 3P* and Iod whose triplet state quenching was not observed. Interestingly, a new LFP signal could be observed at 700 nm (with a lifetime >150 μs) after the PA/Iod photolysis (Fig. S19†). As previously described by Pappas et al.,25 the latter signal can be attributed to the 4-methylphenyliodinium radical cation (MePhI˙+). The overall mechanism involving purpurin derivatives and Iod is described in Scheme 2. These statements have been previously described and confirmed indirectly by LFP, EPR spin-trapping and steady-state photolysis experiments. For more clarity, we only present the mechanism involving PA which can occur in the singlet or triplet excited state. The oxidation of the PA singlet or triplet excited state by Iod leads to the decomposition of the unstable (MePh)2I˙ to iodomethylbenzene and the 4-methylphenyl radical ((steps 2 and 6), according to EPR experiments). The formation of MePhI˙+ (step 3) is confirmed by LFP, and in further step reactions photoacids (H+) are generated (see the steady-state photolysis of purpurin derivatives, Fig. S12C, S13C and S14C†). The formation of H+ is also indirectly confirmed by cationic photopolymerization of epoxy monomers (see kinetic studies).

Photoreactivity of P, PmA and PA/MDEA photoiniating systems
In the presence of amines, the photoexcited hydroxyanthraquinones (HAQ) behave as efficient electron acceptors26,27 generating the corresponding anthrasemiquinones (radical anions) detectable by cw-EPR spectroscopy.28–30 Consequently, the EPR signal (g = 2.0043) with an unresolved hyperfine structure (Fig. S20†) measured upon the LED@450 nm irradiation of P/MDEA solution in benzene under argon was assigned to the purpurin anthrasemiquinone.31 This paramagnetic species is detectable also in the irradiated solution of P/MDEA/DMPO/benzene/Ar, especially upon prolonged LED@450 nm exposure, and simultaneously two DMPO-adducts are produced reflecting the trapping of reactive radical species formed via MDEA˙+ transformation, i.e., the aminoalkyl radical DMPO-adduct32 (aN = 1.461 ± 0.001 mT, aβH = 1.788 ± 0.008 mT, aγH = 0.115 ± 0.001 mT, aγH = 0.074 ± 0.002 mT; g = 2.0058 ± 0.0001) and the carbon-centered radical DMPO-adduct (aN = 1.468 ± 0.002 mT, aβH = 2.024 ± 0.010 mT; g = 2.0059 ± 0.0001) (Fig. S21†). The stability of DMPO-adducts is low, and after radiation cut-off they immediately disappeared from spectra. The irradiation of PmA/MDEA/DMPO/benzene/Ar (LED@450 nm, Fig. S22A†) or PA/MDEA/DMPO/benzene/Ar (LED@400 nm, Fig. 3A) resulted in the generation of both DMPO-adducts, with the prevailing signal of the DMPO-adduct with an aminoalkyl radical. The EPR spectra of the corresponding anthrasemiquinones were recorded in DMPO-free systems by irradiating the deoxygenated benzene solutions of PmA/MDEA (Fig. S22B†) or PA/MDEA (Fig. 3B), and the slightly better resolved spectra allow one to estimate the approximate hyperfine coupling constants of hydrogen nuclei (Table S3†). Further experimental evidence for the purpurin derivatives’ interaction with MDEA was given by steady-state photolysis, fluorescence and LFP experiments. The addition of MDEA leads, whatever the nature of purpurin derivatives, to a strong decrease of their absorbance between 400 and 500 nm (Fig. S12D, S13D and S14D†). The fluorescence quenching constants KSV of P and PmA by MDEA were found to be 4800 M−1 and 13 M−1 (Fig. S23A and S23B,† respectively). No fluorescence quenching was observed between the singlet excited state of PA and MDEA. Interestingly, only the triplet excited lifetimes of PmA (Fig. S24†) and PA (Fig. 4) decreased when MDEA is added. The bimolecular rate constants for the quenching of 3PmA* and 3PA* by MDEA (i.e. kMDEAq (3PmA*) and kMDEAq (3PA*)) were respectively found to be 2 ± 0.1 × 107 M−1 s−1 at 410 nm and 7 ± 0.6 × 108 M−1 s−1 at 560 nm. According to Fig. 4, a new radical species is observed with a lifetime >100 μs when increasing the MDEA concentration; the latter corresponds to anthrasemiquinone (i.e. the carbon-centrered radical on PA) which is in perfect agreement with the EPR results. Therefore, the EPR and LFP experiments undoubtedly confirm an electron transfer reaction followed by a proton transfer process from MDEA to PA (eqn (7)). PA + MDEA (hv) → PAH˙ + MDEA˙(–H)(7)

Photoreactivity of P, PmA and PA/TT photoiniating systems
Upon photoexcitation of P, PmA and PA in deoxygenated benzene solutions containing TT and DMPO, the analogous EPR spectra were recorded in all photoinitiating systems, and the spin-Hamiltonian parameters elucidated from the simulation spectra (i.e. aN = 1.347 ± 0.003 mT, aβH = 1.173 ± 0.003 mT, aγH = 0.090 ± 0.004 mT, aγH = 0.097 ± 0.005 mT; g = 2.0061 ± 0.0001) correlate well with the generation of the DMPO-adduct with the thiyl radical ˙DMPO-SR (Fig. S25A, S26A,† and Fig. 5A for P/TT, PmA/TT and PA/TT, respectively). The addition of Iod in these photoinitiating systems resulted in the simultaneous generation of two DMPO-adducts,20,32i.e., ˙DMPO-phenyl(4-methyl) and ˙DMPO-SR, as shown in Fig. S25B (P/TT/Iod), S26B (PmA/TT/Iod)† and Fig. 5B (PA/TT/Iod). The stability of DMPO-adducts is very low, and after radiation cut-off they disappeared from spectra. Steady-state photolysis confirms a synergistic interaction between P, PmA and PA ground states and TT as their absorption band rapidly decreases after the addition of TT under light irradiation (Fig. S12E, S13E and S14E†). Surprisingly, only the singlet excited state of PmA is quenched by TT with a fluorescence quenching constant KSV (PmA/TT) = 1 M−1 (Fig. S27†). Interestingly, only the triplet excited lifetimes of P and PA decreased when TT is added. The bimolecular rate constants for the quenching of 3P* and 3PA* by TT (i.e. kTTq (3P*) and kTTq (3PA*)) were found to be 2.4 ± 0.2 × 107 M−1 s−1 at 410 nm (Fig. S28†), and 1.2 ± 0.1 × 108 M−1 s−1 at 560 nm, respectively (Fig. 6). The corresponding mechanism without Iod is described as follows (eqn (8)). Purpurin derivative + RSH (hv) protonated purpurin derivative radical + RS˙(8)

When Iod is added to the purpurin derivative/TT system, a similar mechanism could be observed to that of (eqn (8)) but the formation of a MePh radical in the medium should be taken into consideration as follows (eqn (9)). The MePh radical can be involved in an H-abstraction reaction, thus generating thyil radicals. MePh˙ + RSH (hv) → MePh-H + RS˙(9)
Kinetic studies
Different photoinitiating systems including the three purpurin derivatives have been described by RT-FTIR by following the epoxy and acrylate conversions of EPOX and TMPTA/HEA monomers, respectively, at different LED irradiation wavelengths (385, 405, 455, 470, 530 nm) and under a Xe lamp. P, AQ and BP were used as type II reference photosensitizers.
Free-radical photopolymerization with purpurin derivatives/MDEA systems
Photopolymerizations were carried out with PmA/MDEA (Fig. S29†) and PA/MDEA systems (Fig. 7), and compared with the references P/MDEA, AQ/MDEA and BP/MDEA (Fig. S30†). The final conversions after 800 s of irradiation are summarized in Table 1. Photopolymerizations with PmA and PA occur without any period of inhibition. As previously demonstrated in the mechanistic EPR investigation, an electron transfer reaction followed by a proton transfer process from MDEA to the triplet excited state of PmA or PA is observed, leading to the formation of aminoalkyl radicals which can initiate FRP in laminate. Overall, the kinetics of TMPTA polymerization with the PA/MDEA photoinitiating system are faster than those with PmA/MDEA or P/MDEA under air or in laminate. In laminate, this phenomenon could be explained by a higher bimolecular rate constant for the quenching of 3PA* (7 ± 0.6 × 108 M−1 s−1 at 560 nm) by MDEA than that observed with 3PmA* (2 ± 0.1 × 107 M−1 s−1 at 410 nm). In contrast, kinetic profiles and conversions are less efficient under air as oxygen is well known to be a scavenger of radical species,5 thus inhibiting the FRP. However, Table 1 shows also the high reactivity of PA in comparison with P or PmA with regard to FRP under air and in laminate. In light of the LFP and fluorescence results, it seems that photochemical pathways with PA occur mainly in its triplet excited state, and surprisingly the bimolecular rate constant for the quenching of 3PA* (2 × 108 M−1 s−1 at 560 nm) by O2 is quite lower than those of 3P* (3.4 × 108 M−1 s−1 at 410 nm) and 3PmA* (3.7 × 108 M−1 s−1 at 410 nm) with oxygen (Fig. S31†). This could explain the better reactivity of PA photoinitiating systems under air than those containing P or PmA towards acrylate monomers.

The other reason which could be responsible for the lower reactivity of P or PmAvs. PA is that phenolic purpurin can interact with the active radical species generated in the bulk during the photoinduced polymerization reaction; the generated phenoxyl radicals could act as efficient termination agents, thus inhibiting the growing polymer chains and the FRP.33 Another interesting feature according to the EPR data is the generation of new carbon-radical species under light exposure when PA is employed. The additional formation of these carbon-radical species may explain the increase of acrylate conversions in comparison with P and PmA derived photoinitiating systems. Interestingly, the final acrylate conversions with PA derived photoinitiating systems are higher than those described with type II photosensitizers (AQ and BP, see Table 1) or camphorquinone.19 It is also interesting to point out that the final acrylate conversion of TMPTA under our experimental conditions under polychromatic Xe lamp exposure is higher than those previously described; for example, 27% of TMPTA conversion was reached after 400 s of irradiation in laminate with a QZ derivative oil Blue N/MDEA photoinitiating system34 (0.5%/2% w/w, polychromatic lamp); recently, Zhang et al. described the use of an aminoanthraquinone/MDEA (0.5%/2% w/w) system for the acrylate polymerization of TMPTA whose conversion reached 38% and slightly increased to 50% under LED@455 nm (in laminate after 300 s of irradiation, light intensity = 60 mW cm−2) with the introduction of a third component;35 despite the interesting kinetic profiles, the final acrylate conversions are not higher than that obtained with PA/MDEA 0.5%/2% (w/w). Even with the introduction of a higher concentration of MDEA (5 wt%, 2.5 times higher than in our investigation), the acrylate conversion of TMPTA hardly reached 60% in laminate after 600 s of Xe polychromatic irradiation36 (light intensity = 57 mW cm−2). Finally, the combination of a naphthalimide-based methacrylate photoinitiator37 with MDEA (1%/2% w/w) did not improve the FRP of TMPTA whose conversion barely increases to 23% in laminate after 800 s of irradiation under a halogen lamp (light intensity = 12 mW cm−2).
Interestingly, the results are similar to those previously described with the diallyl quinizarin19 (QA)/MDEA (0.5%/2% w/w) system as the rate constant kMDEAq (QA) = 5.4 ± 0.2 × 108 M−1 s−1 is similar to kMDEAq (PA). We can also underline that PA/MDEA has the particularity to polymerize also at 530 nm which is not the case for QA/MDEA.
Free-radical photopolymerization with purpurin derivatives/Iod systems
The FRP of TMPTA occurs with P (Fig. S32A†), PmA (Fig. S33A†) and PA (Fig. 8). The reference kinetics of photopolymerization with BP and AQ are shown in Fig. S34 and S35,† respectively. The final acrylate conversions in laminate or under air after 800 s of irradiation are summarized in Table 2. Conversions in laminate are relatively high under different LED irradiation ranging from 385 to 530 nm. This is likely due to the formation of 4-methylphenyl radicals (according to the oxidation of the PA triplet excited state by Iod, see EPR experiments) which can initiate the FRP of TMPTA. However, the final conversions are lower than that observed with purpurin derivatives/MDEA; this could be explained by the low selectivity of 4-methylphenyl radicals which can induce side reactions through H-abstraction reactions. In contrast, the FRP of TMPTA does not occur under air; indeed, 4-methylphenyl radicals are quenched by oxygen leading to the formation of peroxyl radicals which are unable to initiate the polymerization. Kinetic results are similar to those described with quinizarin derivatives;19 the slight difference could be the most favorable negative free energy change ΔG (QA/Iod) in comparison with ΔG (PA/Iod), favoring preferentially a higher electron transfer between the excited triplet state of quinizarin derivatives19 and the ground state of Iod than that with PA. However, our system is clearly most efficient than some investigated iod derived systems: with a three-component photoinitiating system i.e. naphthalimide-based methacrylated/Iod/NVK (1%/2%/3% w/w/w), only 40% of the acrylate function of TMPTA was consumed after 800 s in laminate using laser diodes.37 Recently, 25% and 15% of TMPTA conversions were obtained with an innovative 5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone/Iod (0.5%/2% w/w) system described by Peng et al.38 after 300 s of LED@410 nm (100 mW cm−2) and LED@445 nm (80 mW cm−2) exposure, respectively; a slight increase of the final conversion was observed (up to 40%) with the addition of 2 wt% of EDB.38

Interestingly, the nature of the acrylate monomer has shown a great impact on the FRP under air. The increase of the monomer viscosity (from TMPTA – 70–120 cps; to HEA – 1200 cps) led to high acrylate conversions as described in Table 2 and in Fig. S32–S35.† Increasing viscosity prevents oxygen diffusion into the film during the photopolymerization, thus avoiding the formation of inert peroxyl radicals which are unable to initiate FRP.39
Thiol–ene process with purpurin derivatives/TT systems
Purpurin derivatives (PmA-Fig. S36† and PA-Fig. 9) represent highly efficient systems when coupled with TT. P/TT (Fig. S37†), AQ/TT (Fig. S38†) and BP/TT (Fig. S39†) are used as references for the thiol–ene process. The final acrylate conversions reach 70% even under air (Table 3) and FRP occurs without any period of inhibition. According to EPR spin-trapping, the irradiation of purpurin derivatives/TT systems leads by a H-abstraction reaction to the formation of thiyl radicals (RS˙) responsible for the consumption of acrylate. The kinetics of photopolymerization under air are slowly influenced because the resulting peroxyl radicals (RSOO˙) are involved in a H transfer reaction with TT leading to the regeneration of thiyl radicals which can also initiate FRP. Interestingly, the final acrylate conversions with the PA/TT system are higher than that of the quinizarin derivative (QA)/TT.19 This is likely due to the lower reactivity of QA toward TT than that of PA. Indeed, the bimolecular quenching rate constant kTTq (QA) of the QA triplet state19 by TT (kTTq (QA) = 8.1 ± 0.2 × 106 M−1 s−1) is lower than kTTq (PA) (kTTq (PA) = 1.1 ± 0.2 × 108 M−1 s−1); this result is associated with a H-abstraction reaction which occurs more quickly with PA/TT than QA/TT. Reactions with the reference type II photosensitizers occur well in the 385–405 nm range but the final acrylate conversions remain lower than that observed with PA/TT.

Interestingly, the addition of Iod increases the final acrylate and thiol conversions under air and in laminate for all the purpurin derivative systems. These results are in full agreement with the formation of 4-methylphenyl radicals which participate both in the FRP of TMPTA by reacting with acrylate double bonds and in the thiol–ene process according to eqn (9). It is interesting to note that the final thiol conversions are higher with PA/TT/Iod (Fig. 9) than with QA/TT/Iod, confirming the highest reactivity of PA compared to QA toward TT. Surprisingly, acrylate polymerizations/thiol–ene process with P or PmA when coupled with TT or Iod/TT (Fig. S36 and S37†) are observed and side reactions involving phenoxyl radicals could be envisaged; indeed, phenoxyl radicals may also abstract H from TT, thus generating thiyl radicals which are implied in the thiol–ene process.
Simultaneous FRP and CP of an acrylate/epoxy monomer blend
Concomitant free-radical and cationic polymerizations of a TMPTA/EPOX or HEA/EPOX blend mixture were achieved under air or in laminate with purpurin derivatives/Iod photoinitiating systems. Table 4 summarizes all the final acrylate and epoxy conversions. The formation of Brønsted acids H+ after the photolysis of purpurin derivatives/Iod systems (Fig. S12C, S13C and S14C†) leads to the cationic photopolymerization of EPOX under air; PA/Iod appears as the most efficient cationic photoinitiating system (Fig. 10 and Table 4) as PA is less sensitive to oxygen quenching compared to P or PmA (see the LFP results). Not surprisingly, the kinetics of cationic polymerization with BP and AQ derived systems (Fig. S40†) do not work as well as the PA system as the triplet exited states of BP and AQ are highly quenched by oxygen according to Wilkinson's investigation40 (kq (BP/O2) = 3 × 109 M−1 s−1 and kq (AQ/O2) = 1.4 × 109 M−1 s−1 > kq(PA/O2) = 2 × 108 M−1 s−1). It should also be pointed out that the combination of epoxy and acrylate monomers significantly increases the final acrylate conversions (Fig. S41–S43†). This accelerating effect refers to the hydrogen donation capability of the EPOX monomer to form additional initiating radical species as previously demonstrated in few other investigations.41,42 Finally, the latter phenomenon is even more observed as the viscosity of the acrylate monomer increases, reducing drastically the diffusion of oxygen into the formulation (Fig. S44–S46†).

Application of 3D printing
Among several 3D printing techniques, the use of photochemistry is extremely attractive as new 3D objects can be synthesized via visible-light irradiation in a reduced time from the synergistic combination of photoreactive monomers and suitable photoinitiators.43 Specifically, novel visible-light photoinitiators absorb the emission light from a 3D printer, thus enabling the photopolymerization reactions of specific monomers layer-by-layer to produce newly designed 3D objects. In this context, we proposed the synthesis of 3D objects (see Fig. 11) under air upon LED@405 nm irradiation with the use of the most efficient photoinitiator described in this study, i.ePA. Two types of 3D objects were produced: (1) an open square cube with 1 cm length and 0.6 cm height and (2) a 3D bar with 3 cm length, 0.5 cm width and 0.2 cm thickness. PA appears as an interesting visible-light photosensitizer for 3D printing applications. This provides a way to the synthesis of novel materials by 3D printing photopolymerization.

Dual role of the photosensitizer
Antibacterial tests. Photodynamic therapy is well known for cancer treatment and has been recently extended to photodynamic inactivation of bacteria.44–47 This method allows producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsible for bacterial damage. As a result, some materials have shown efficient antibacterial properties against Gram-positive bacteria when exposed to solar light. However, the synthesis strategies of the current antibacterial systems and their design drawbacks concerning recycling. As shown in Fig. S47,†PA was used as a photosensitizer for the synthesis of a new photoactive and recycling antibacterial material against S. aureus. Three antimicrobial cycling experiments on the same biomaterial were performed for the first time to evaluate its long-term efficiency as a biocide agent. Adhesion and proliferation of S. aureus have been observed at the surface of the materials even after the third antibacterial cycling experiment (Fig. 12). However, when samples are exposed to solar light irradiation, a tremendous inhibition (>99%) of bacterial adhesion at the surface of the incubated materials is observed whatever the number of cycles. For example, the optical images of the Petri dishes of the irradiated and non-irradiated samples for each of the three antibacterial cycle experiments are shown in Fig. S48.† This inhibition phenomenon could be easily explained by the capability of PA to produce singlet oxygen under light irradiation as shown in Fig. S49.† This result is of great importance as it undoubtedly demonstrates that our material could be re-used without losing its antibacterial properties. Interestingly, no diffusion of the PA photoinitiator out of the materials was observed certainly due to its covalent connection to the photoinduced polymer network with the allyl groups.

Conclusions
Purpurin derivatives i.e. mono-allylated purpurin (PmA) and tri-allylated purpurin (PA) in combination with co-initiators (Iod, MDEA or TT) showed potential initiating properties for both FRP and CP under visible-light exposure (LED@405 nm, 455 nm, 470 nm, 530 nm and a Xe lamp) under air and oxygen-free conditions. Interestingly, final epoxy and acrylate conversions obtained in laminate or under air with PA derived type II photoinitiating systems are more efficient than well-described and common photoinitiating systems described in the literature. We also demonstrated that PA could be used to design 3D objects by the 3D photoprinting technique. Interestingly, the resulting materials incorporating PA have undoubtedly showed excellent antibacterial properties with a tremendous inhibition (>99%) of bacterial adhesion under visible-light exposure, even after three antibacterial cycling experiments, thus highlighting the capability of the material to be recycled.
