    , Accepted 29th December 2015First published on 29th December 2015AbstractIn this paper, two novel linked-acceptor type D–A conjugated polymers POP and POM have been synthesized by Stille polymerization as donor materials for polymer solar cells (PSCs). The concept of introducing intramolecular noncovalent conformational locks into the main chain has been implemented to improve the coplanarity of the linked-acceptor polymers using alkyl substituted thiophenes as π bridges. In this paper, the alkyl side chain substituted in the thiophene bridge has been replaced with an alkoxy chain, in which the oxygen atoms on the side chain and the sulfur atoms on the neighbor thiophene unit could form a coulombic interaction and expand the conjugation degree of the polymers. As a result, the new polymer POP shows better planarity, absorbance ability and processability than that without conformational locks. Although the open-circuit voltage has a small decrease due to the stronger electron-donating nature of the alkoxy group, the fill factor and the current density values have been increased and the resulting best power conversion efficiency has been increased up to 8.18%. This work will become an impactful extending work of linked-acceptor type conjugated polymers and the result suggests that this conformational locking strategy might be a very promising method for the design and construction of novel highly efficient donor materials.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on polymers and small molecules have been an important subject of renewable energies in the past few decades. Although the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is still lower than their inorganic semiconductor counterparts, solution-processable organic devices have shown advantages of low weight, large area and flexibility.1–5 The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) is the most widely used structure in organic solar cells, consisting of a series of polymers and small molecules as donor materials and fullerene derivatives as acceptor materials in a blend active layer. In the development of donor materials, donor–acceptor (D–A) type materials have been proved to be effective in tuning the optical and electrochemical properties. Some research groups have also applied two or more acceptor units in the polymers, achieving a lower HOMO level.6–8 Over the past few years, the performance of OSCs has increased dramatically through delicate chemical structure design and embellishment. A PCE over 10% has been achieved in bulk heterojunction structure solar cells,9–12 and the notable PCE is beneficial for commercial application.13 The high performance materials possess some common features: (1) a narrow band gap and a low highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level, which are better for solar absorption and open circuit voltage (Voc); (2) a planar structure for efficient π–π interaction and high mobility; (3) good solution processability owing to alkyl chain engineering on the long conjugated backbone, which can influence the solubility and film quality.
For organic semiconductors, the intramolecular and intermolecular interactions originating from the backbone structure and side chain engineering could determine the molecular aggregation and charge transport.14 Recently, there are several reports on introducing coulombic interactions between the oxygen atoms and sulfur atoms in the main chain for organic solar cells.15–19 This interaction plays an important role as a noncovalent conformational lock, which can improve the backbone planarity as well as molecular stacking and charge carrier transport.20–22 As a consequence, the performance of solar cells was improved, especially in the fill factor (FF). Moreover, FF could be influenced by a range of other elements, such as the stacking structure order, film morphology, D–A interface, carrier recombination and so forth. Therefore, comprehensive interpretation of the mechanism is worth further investigation. Some organic field-effect transistor (OFET) device studies based on polymers with O⋯S interactions were also reported in which high hole and electron mobilities were achieved.23–25 And most of the O⋯S interactions are formed between the carbonyl oxygen atoms and their neighbouring thiophene sulfur atoms. In some previous work, an alkoxy side chain was incorporated into the polymers, which was also to create intramolecular interactions.26–29 However, the strong electron-donating nature of the alkoxy group could raise the HOMO level of the corresponding polymers, which would decrease the Voc of polymer solar cells.30,31
In our previous work of linked-acceptor type polymer PBDTT-LTPD (which is called PH in this work), two TPD units were introduced in one repeating unit, which can enhance the acceptor density in the polymer backbone and lower the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level. In this work, based on the high Voc and considerable efficiency of PH,32 the side chain group of the thiophene bridge was replaced with an alkoxy chain to further increase the performance of the devices. As shown in Scheme 1, the concept of intramolecular noncovalent conformational locks was implemented, and two novel linked-acceptor type polymers POP and POM were designed and synthesized, which displayed a similar conjugated backbone to PH. Two kinds of alkoxy chains (pentyloxy and methoxyl) with different lengths were introduced to tune the solubility and processability. This small chemical structure change seemed vital but distinctly influenced the photophysical properties of the resulting polymers. As a result, the POP showed an improved performance compared with that of the alkyl analogous polymer PH. The highest PCE reaches 8.18% with a Voc of 0.97 V, a Jsc of 14.48 mA cm−2, and a FF of 56.7%.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of the PH, POP, and POM. PH was synthesised in toluene (10 mL) and DMF (2 mL), 100 °C, 10 h under an argon atmosphere. POP was synthesised in ODCB (10 mL) and DMF (2 mL), 110 °C, 6 h under an argon atmosphere. POM was synthesised in ODCB (10 mL) and DMF (2 mL), 110 °C, 5 h under an argon atmosphere. 
2. Experimental section
Materials and methods
All reagents and chemicals were purchased from Aldrich, Alfa and used as received. Solvents and other common reagents were obtained from the Beijing Chemical Plant. Toluene, chloroform and tetrahydrofuran were freshly distilled prior to use. The other materials were used without further purification. 3,4-Dihexylthiophene (1) and thiophene-3,4-dicarboxylic acid (4) were purchased from Aldrich and used as received. 5-Octyl-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (5) and 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDTT-Sn) were prepared according to the literature procedures.33
Polymers POP and POM were synthesized according to the same procedure as PH (ESI†). It is worth mentioning that due to the introduction of the O⋯S interaction, the solubility of monomers (compound M1 and compound M2) is very poor in toluene even at high temperatures. So the final Stille-polymerizations were proceeded in o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB), which are different from its hexyl analogous monomer. However, the solubility of the final product POP is as good as PH. The results of high-temperature gel permeation chromatography measurements with 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the eluent (140 °C) showed that the number-average molecular weight (Mn) is 50.4 kDa, the polydispersity index (PDI) is 2.77 for POP and the Mn is 12.1 kDa, and PDI is 2.39 for POM. The molecular structures of all intermediates were characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). The polymer was purified through column chromatography with chloroform as the eluent to obtain the product in the form of a dark solid. Theoretical calculation, UV-vis absorption, cyclic voltammetry (CV), space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements, atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) were conducted to analyze the properties of the polymers.
Synthesis of PBDTT-LTPD-OM

Synthesis of POM. 
2,5-Bis(3-bromo-5-octyl-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione)3,4-dimethoxythiophene (M2) (82.8 mg, 0.1 mmol) and 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene (BDTT-Sn) (90.4 mg, 0.1 mmol) were dissolved in o-dichlorobenzene (10 mL) and dimethylformamide (DMF, 2 mL). The solution was flushed with argon for 10 min, and then Pd(PPh3)4 (11.5 mg, 0.01 mmol, 10% with respect to the monomer) was added and the flask was purged three times with successive vacuum and argon filling cycles. The polymerization reaction mixture was heated to 110 °C and stirred for 5 h under an argon atmosphere. The mixture was cooled to room temperature and poured slowly in methanol (200 mL). The solid was filtered through a 0.45 μm PTFE filter. The polymer was further purified by column chromatography using chloroform as the eluent. Then the polymer solution was poured in methanol (200 mL). The solid was filtered through a 0.45 μm PTFE filter and a dark red solid was obtained. The solid was dried under vacuum overnight (80.9 mg, yield: 65%), Mn = 12.1 kDa, PDI = 2.39, 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, ppm) δ: 7.74–7.35 (r, 4H), 6.94–6.90 (r, 2H), 4.02–4.00 (r, 6H), 3.61–3.53 (r, 4H), 2.92–2.73 (r, 4H), 1.78–1.63 (r, 10H), 1.25–1.33 (r, 32H), 0.90–0.86 (r, 18H).


Synthesis of POP. 
POP was synthesized according to the same procedure of POM. The reaction time is 6 h and the yield is 70%, Mn = 50.4 kDa, PDI = 2.77, 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, ppm) δ: 7.74–7.35 (r, 4H), 6.94–6.90 (r, 2H), 4.02–4.00 (r, 4H), 3.61–3.53 (r, 4H), 2.92–2.73 (r, 4H), 1.78–1.63 (r, 14H), 1.25–1.39 (r, 40H), 0.90–0.86 (r, 24H).

3. Results and discussion
Theoretical calculation
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to determine the effects of the alkoxy chain substituted thiophene bridge for the conformation of polymers. To shorten the long side chain, the alkyl groups are replaced by methyl and the alkoxy groups have been replaced by methoxy. From the optimized geometries (see Fig. 1), in PH, the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and n-alkylthieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) moieties on the backbone are almost planar. However, the thiophene and TPD moieties in the backbone are twisted. In the case of POM/POP, the electron-donating BDT and withdrawing linked-acceptor moieties on the backbone are almost fully coplanar. This should be due to the introduction of the O⋯S interaction in POM/POP, which could lock the molecular conformation. The better planarity will lead to an improved light absorption and a narrow band gap, as it is unfolded in the calculation results (Fig. 3c). However, the strong electron-donating nature of the alkoxy group could shallow the HOMO level. So the calculated HOMO energy of POM/POP is increased by 0.16 eV with respect to PH (Fig. 2). This suggests that POM/POP would have a smaller Voc value than PH.

Optical properties and electrochemical properties

Fig. 3a and b show the UV-vis absorption of the polymers in chloroform solution and spin-coated films respectively. All of the three polymers showed an obvious red shift from solution to films, which were due to the close packing of the polymer backbones in the solid state. POP and POM showed larger absorption maxima peaks (612 nm and 621 nm respectively) than PH (608 nm), suggesting better aggregation in the film and a narrower band gap.34 An obvious colour difference between the three polymers in solution with the same concentration is shown in Fig. S6.† However, the aggregation property is determined by both the structures of the backbone and side chains. Since the aggregation of PH is strong enough, the offset of the red-shift influenced by side chains is very little in this system. The absorption edge of POP shows a little blue shift compared to POM, which is due to the fact that a long side chain increases the steric effect and influences the packing state. The electrochemical properties of the polymers were investigated using the cyclic voltammetry method, as displayed in Fig. 3d. The HOMO levels of POP and POM are −5.37 eV and −5.54 eV respectively, which are a bit higher than that of PH (−5.62 eV). This is due to the stronger electron-donating nature of the alkoxy group. The high HOMO level will decrease the Voc of the solar cell devices. The UV-vis absorption and electrochemical properties are consistent with the calculation results and they are shown in Table 1.

Transport properties
The hole mobility was measured using the SCLC method given the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PCBM/Au. As illustrated in Fig. S1,† the hole mobilities are 1.9 × 10−5, 1.1 × 10−4 and 3.3 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PH, POP and POM neat films respectively. The mobility of the POP is the highest among the three polymers, which could be explained by the greater backbone coplanarity and film quality. The high hole mobility of POP is good for improving the FF values in the PSC devices.
Photovoltaic properties
PSCs were fabricated with the conventional BHJ structure in chloroform solution. The device structure is ITO/PEDOT:PSS(40 nm)/polymer:PCBM/Ca(20 nm)/Al(100 nm) with active areas measuring as 0.04 mm2. Device optimization was performed at different D/A ratios and additive (1,8-diiodooctane, DIO) concentrations. The performance is presented in Table 2. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves for the optimized devices are shown in Fig. 4a. The long side chain facilitates better solubility and processability for POP leading to good film quality. The Jsc and FF of POP is increased from 14.32 mA cm−2 to 14.48 mA cm−2 and from 52.0% to 56.7% respectively, showing more increase than that of PH. However, due to the electron-donating nature of the alkoxy chain, the Voc of the POP is decreased from 1.0 V to 0.97 V. The POM shows a relatively lower PCE because of its poor solubility and processability; even its molecular weight is relatively low. The application of conformational locks in linked-acceptor type polymer solar cells increases the Jsc and FF at the same time. Even though the increasing extent is limited in this system, the best PCE (8.18%) obtained from the POP based device is higher than PH (7.59%). Fig. 4b shows the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves. The EQE value of POP is similar and a little higher than that of PH, which is consistent with the Jsc values. Moreover, the other conventional device parameters for varied conditions are detailed in Table S1 in the ESI.†

GIWAXS
GIWAXS was used to determine the structural information and crystallinity of the polymer neat films and blend films with PC71BM (Fig. 5). Fig. 5g and h show the in-plane and out-of-plane patterns of the 2D GIWAXS profiles. The π–π stacking peaks (010) are pronounced in the out-of-plane direction for PH and POP neat films, which indicates a face-on structure. All of these three polymers show a strong stacking peak in the powder state as shown in Fig. S2.† However, the POM does not show an obvious stacking peak in both out-of-plane and in-plane directions in the film state due to the bad film quality. The POP shows a stronger face-on structure and a lesser π–π stacking distance (about 3.90 Å) than PH (about 4.02 Å). In blend films, molecular packing is influenced by PC71BM. The π–π stacking of PH gets weaker. However, the POP maintains obvious molecular packing peaks even with a high ratio of PC71BM. This is due to the strong molecular aggregation making the microstructure more tight and regular, and less influenced by PC71BM. The face-on structure in blend films is beneficial for charge carriers transport perpendicular to the substrate plane and this could be the main reason for the improved Jsc and FF.

Film morphology
The morphologies of the films under different conditions were measured by AFM and TEM, as shown in Fig. 6. The blend films of POM/PC71BM and POP/PC71BM show a large domain size without DIO. The root mean square (RMS) of POM is 15.3 nm and the ruler is also larger (100 nm) than the others (40 nm) (Fig. S5†). The phase size and film quality are finely changed after DIO is added. Due to the short alkyl chain, POM shows stronger unordered aggregation and worse miscibility with PC71BM, which leads to a bad device performance. PH shows sheet domains and the RMS is 1.8 nm. As a comparison, the POP shows uniform short fibrillar domains with a smaller size than PH, which could be more appropriate for charge separation and transport.35 The TEM images show deeper information about the donor and acceptor miscibility and the interpenetrating network structure. From Fig. 6g, we can see large bright polymer aggregations, which could act as a trap when carriers transfer through the active layer. The TEM image of the POP:PC71BM (1:1.7 with 1.6% DIO, Fig. 6h) blend film is consistent with its AFM image and the fibrillar domains are clearly visible. The good morphology and face-on structure could be the main reasons for the good device performance.

4. Conclusions
In this manuscript, we report two polymers POP and POM based on a linked-acceptor type polymer backbone. The results provide us an innovation to regulate the relationship between the device performance and materials with noncovalent conformational locks. Benefitting from the flexibility of the thiophene bridge, the O⋯S interaction is introduced into a linked-acceptor type polymer. This strategy improves the polymer planarity and leads to better absorption properties, transport properties and molecular packing structure. The different lengths of the side chain play an important role in the active layer processability, which could dramatically influence the device integral performance. In comparison with the previous work, the FF has been increased up to 56.7%, the Jsc has been increased up to 14.48 mA cm−2, and the Voc has a little decrease. The final PCE has been increased to 8.18% from 7.59%. The results demonstrate that the introduction of conformational locks in linked-acceptor type polymers is a promising way in molecules design. This work will become an impactful extending work of linked-acceptor type conjugated polymers.
