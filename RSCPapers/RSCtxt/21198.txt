    , Accepted 25th August 2022First published on 25th August 2022AbstractMixed-halide perovskites are highly promising materials for tandem solar cells. The phenomenon of phase segregation, however hinders their application. Here, we combine Fourier-Transform photocurrent spectroscopy with photoluminescence and current density–voltage (J–V) measurements to study the effect of light soaking on such materials and devices. At first, we observe a gradual formation of an I-rich phase, which correlates with an increase in deep defect level concentration. We attribute these deep defects to charged iodide interstitials and associate phase segregation with iodide migration through interstitial positions. Upon further light soaking, the second less I-rich phase forms, while the deep level concentration simultaneously decreases. An empirical model describing the phase segregation mechanism is proposed to rationalize these observations. Further, we point to an important role of grain size in determining the degree and terminal phase of segregation.
Introduction
Halide perovskites have been the focus of intense scientific research due to advantageous properties ranging from low-cost manufacturing1 to high carrier diffusion lengths,2 high absorption coefficient, sharp absorption edge onset,3 and defect tolerance.4 Thanks to these properties, perovskites are highly promising materials for a wide range of technologies, including perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and light-emitting diodes. Regarding solar cells, single-junction perovskite devices now reach a power conversion efficiency >25%.5 In addition, the low temperature of deposition and bandgap tunability of these materials also make them well-suited for multi-junction solar cells. Indeed, mixed-halide perovskites ABX3 where A is typically MA+ = CH3NH3+, FA+ = CH(NH2)2+ and/or Cs+, B is Pb2+ and/or Sn2+, and X is I−, Br− and/or chloride Cl−, have tuneable bandgaps between 1.2 and >2 eV, ideal values for perovskite-on-silicon, perovskite-on-perovskite and perovskite-on-CIGS tandem cells.
Here, we focus on the so-called phase segregation of mixed-halide perovskites into I-rich and Br-rich domains. This phenomenon occurs in mixed-halide APb(I,Br)3 perovskites with a bandgap >1.65 eV under continuous illumination or applied electric field.6,7 This process was first observed by recording the evolution of the photoluminescence (PL) of the (I, Br) perovskites, which redshifted during light soaking (LS). This shift was identified to be caused by the formation of small I-rich clusters with narrower bandgaps that were shown to be also highly emissive.6 Amongst the numerous observations reported in the literature, it is worth noting that segregation is shown to be accelerated by excited charge carriers, irrespective of whether these are light-induced or electrically injected in the dark,8–12 and that the surface quality and overall crystallinity plays an important role.13,14 Several solutions have been found to mitigate phase segregation by passivating bulk and interfacial defect states (e.g. by adding a small amount of Cl15 or by replacing MA+ with FA+ or Cs+9,16).
While phase segregation is known to result from halide transport, the exact halide migration channels and the force driving the process remain elusive. Various models based on thermodynamic considerations,17 polaron-induced lattice strain,18 charge carrier gradients19 or local electric fields13 have been used to explain the origin of halide migration.7 Regarding the dominating migration channel, a comparison of the segregation rates in either halide-deficient or halide-excessive perovskites when halide vacancies or interstitials prevail, respectively, has led to the conclusion that the process is vacancy-mediated.19–21 However, as suggested in,22 LS itself may create additional defects via non-radiative recombination of photo-generated electron–hole pairs which may further affect phase segregation. We have previously reported similar light-induced reversible formation of deep defects in CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPI) with a residual PbI2 layer that we tentatively attributed to iodine interstitials.23 There are only a few works that have recorded such light-induced formation of deep defects in mixed-halide perovskites.24,25 Nevertheless, a detailed evolution of light-induced defects under illumination of mixed-halide perovskites is however still missing and it remains unclear how these defects are linked to phase segregation. It should be further stressed that segregation may be easily altered by varying electrical load.10 In that regard, degradation is most severe in open-circuit conditions (OC), where excited charge carrier density is highest, and lowest at short-circuit (SC),10 while operating the cell at its maximum power point (MPP) was suggested to be the most device-relevant condition to investigate the impact of LS.26
In this study, we combine Fourier-transform photocurrent spectroscopy (FTPS), PL spectroscopy and current density–voltage (J–V) measurements to study the light-induced changes in FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 solar cells. The slower phase segregation rate in FA- and Cs-based mixed-halide perovskites compared to MAPb(Ix,Bry)36,20,27 enables us to precisely record the evolution of phase segregation, including its onset. The high sensitivity and measurement speed of FTPS moreover allow us to correlate the phase segregation rate to the formation of light-induced deep defects. We observe two different trends in the phase segregation process, which vary in the segregated terminal phase. Based on our results, we establish an empirical model of the phase segregation mechanism, in which we carefully analyse halide migration channels, the phase segregation dynamics and the influence of grain size.
Results and discussion
We perform this study on solar cells based on mixed-halide perovskites FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3. The structure of the measured n–i–p solar cells together with a typically measured J–V curve and average photovoltaic (PV) parameters of pristine PSC are shown in Fig. S1.† The used perovskite composition is indirectly confirmed via XRD measurement of lattice parameter (see ESI†).
First, we compare the evolution of the solar-cells' J–V parameters under simulated AM1.5G illumination after LS at OC, SC and MPP, followed by a relaxation in the dark (Fig. 1). In all regimes, there is an overall decrease in photovoltaic parameters during LS. Note that we observe an occasional performance improvement during the first 5 minutes of LS. The light-induced drop in VOC, JSC, fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) is least pronounced when the cell is light-soaked at SC. Under SC condition, photo-generated carriers are mostly extracted to the contacts and the recombination probability within the device is reduced. Conversely, at OC, no net current is flowing out of the device, so all photo-generated carriers recombine. The excess energy released during non-radiative recombination of photo-generated electron–hole pairs may lead to the creation of lattice defects.22,28 Such defects may act as a new recombination centres, deteriorating VOC,29 and FF.25 Higher rate of defect formation at OC compared to SC may then explain the more significant changes in PV parameters during OC.
 Fig. 1  Evolution of normalised PV parameters extracted from J–V curves measured under 1 Sun illumination and during relaxation in the dark. Starting from the top, the open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, fill factor and power conversion efficiency trends are illustrated. Solar cells were held at either open-circuit, short-circuit or MPP condition during light soaking. 
As can be further observed in Fig. 1, a subsequent relaxation in the dark lead to a gradual recovery of the PV parameters for all LS conditions, and interestingly, for the case of short-circuit LS conditions, even to a slight improvement of parameters compared to the initial state. In contrast, a slightly lower VOC, JSC and PCE compared to the initial state are observed after one day recovery for the cells LS at OC regime.
The phase segregation process can be observed by tracking the evolution of the PL spectra upon LS, which is shown in Fig. 2. Initially, the emission is centred at ∼1.76 eV. In both conditions, after ∼5 min of LS, an additional PL peak appears at around 1.6 eV (red arrows, phase 1). Its intensity increases further with illumination time, as observed in ref. 30–32, which suggests efficient carrier funnelling to the low bandgap domains. Both, the newly formed peak (red arrow) and the initial peak at 1.76 eV (blue arrow) show a slight redshift during light soaking. Shifts to lower energies could correspond to a lattice relaxation as proposed by Tsai et al.33 however the shift exceeds 50 meV, indicating that lattice-expansion alone cannot explain this process. At the last stages of LS, the photoluminescence of both peaks is overwhelmed by one signal at 1.67 eV (grey arrow, phase 2). This latter peak highlights the emergence of a second segregated I-rich phase, which contains less iodine than the previous I-rich phase 1. Phase 2 must significantly outweigh in concentration phase 1 as it is more visible by PL despite charge funnelling, which favours radiative recombination in phase 1 with the lowest bandgap. The time evolution of the PL peak positions and integrated PL intensities is illustrated in Fig. S3.†

We confirm the existence of phase segregation also by tracking structural changes via X-ray diffraction measurement (XRD). XRD pattern (see Fig. S11 in ESI†) shows shift of cubic (200) reflection to lower and higher diffraction angles under LS, which corresponds to the formation of I-rich and Br-rich phases, respectively. Details are in ESI.†
To investigate light-induced deep defects and their link to phase segregation in FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 we turn to FTPS. FTPS spectra recorded at different LS times of cells held at OC, SC or MPP and then upon relaxation can be found in Fig. 3 and S5.† Additional FTPS measurements confirming the repeatability of the effects discussed below are shown in Fig. S7 and S8.†

As observed in Fig. 3a, after 5 minutes of irradiation, the absorption edge slope decreases and the Urbach energy EU of the pristine solar cell increases from ∼16 meV to ∼22 meV. The width of the Urbach tail indicates compositional inhomogeneity in the perovskite due to phase segregation. After 40 min of LS, a new distinct shoulder appears at ∼1.58 eV, in line with the phase 1 measured by PL in Fig. 2. After a longer LS duration (>40 min), a shoulder emerges at 1.68 eV, again in line with phase 2 measured by PL. The exact composition of the segregated phase may be obtained using the reference absorption spectra of ref. 34 measured from FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(IxBr1−x)3 films with various Br compositions assuming a linear relationship between bandgap and halide composition. We estimate that the shoulder at ∼1.58 eV corresponds to an I-rich phase with x = 0.9, which is in good accordance with measurements in FAMACs mixed-halide perovskites.35 The shoulder at ∼1.68 eV suggests a dominant I-rich phase with x = 0.8, in line with ref. 6, 20, 27 and 36. By deconvoluting FTPS data, we estimate that the domain with x = 0.8 (x = 0.9) contributes about 10% (0.1%) to the total measured photocurrent.
The intermediate phase 1, however, has not been observed to form upon LS in MAPb(Ix,Bry)3 thin films, presumably as a result of the faster phase segregation in these films6,20,27 compared to FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 ones. A different segregation rates may be explained by the suppression of halide migration via FA and Cs cations.37,38 We suggest that phase segregation starts with the formation of the I-rich phase 1 (x = 0.9) in all mixed-halide perovskites, but it's quickly overwhelmed in fast-segregating films by the final phase 2 (x = 0.8). Furthermore, we do not observe the intermediate phase 1 in FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 thin films (see ESI Fig. S6†). This indicates that the contacts also slow down phase segregation (probably thanks to reduced recombination and subsequent defect formation due to the charge collection at contacts), hence revealing the intermediate phase 1 when LS a full device.
More importantly, we observe that the sub-bandgap photocurrent signal (at photon energies <1.45 eV) is generally growing in intensity, which suggests the formation of deep levels upon LS. Similarly, to the J–V data, the most significant changes in the sub-bandgap part of the FTPS signal are observed for devices kept at OC during irradiation. This correlates well with the above-proposed explanation that defects are created via the excess energy released during non-radiative recombination in OC conditions. After an initial trap formation, further LS leads, in several samples, to a decrease in the FTPS sub-bandgap signal, as observed after 160 min of LS in Fig. 3a and b and S7.† Only the sub-bandgap part of the FTPS signal is decreasing, which likely rules out a deteriorated charge carrier collection and rather points to a decrease in deep level concentration. Such explanation correlates well with J–V measurements (Fig. 1) performed upon LS at OC, in which the FF slightly improves during the later stages of LS process.
Some samples, however, do not show any decline in the concentration of deep defects, even after extended LS (see Fig. 4 and S8†). Upon extended LS, the deep level concentration only saturates simultaneously with phase 1 (see Fig. 4 and 5a), while the previously observed final phase 2 (x = 0.8) is not detected in these samples. The sub-bandgap signal decline therefore seems to be associated with formation of the phase 2. The reason why some samples do not show the commonly observed terminal phase (I0.8Br0.2) will be discussed in detail in the section ‘Variation in terminal phase’.

To better understand the relationship between deep defect level formation and phase segregation rate, we measure the evolution of the FTPS spectra during LS with a higher temporal resolution. In Fig. 5b, we can see a strong correlation between the concentration of light-induced deep defects, obtained by monitoring the sub-bandgap FTPS signal at 1.45 eV, and the magnitude of phase segregation, given by the FTPS signal at ∼1.6 eV. The phase segregation rate is highest up to 40–60 min of LS, which coincides with a significant increase in the concentration of deep defects (Fig. 5a). After 40–60 min of LS, both the phase segregation rate (connected with the formation of the I-rich phase 1) and the deep defect formation saturate. When phase 2 begins to form at longer times of LS, the linear correlation ceases to apply, as can be seen in Fig. S9.† This suggests that phase 2 results from a different mechanism. To fully understand the dynamics of phase segregation as a two-step process and to answer why phase 2 is not formed in several samples we first need to find out the nature of the observed deep defects.
Origin of deep defects
The presence of deep defect levels and the linear correlation of their magnitude with phase segregation rate (with a correlation coefficient r = 0.97, Fig. 5b) provides some information on the nature of the main halide migration channel involved during the segregation process. From density functional theory (DFT) calculations,39 iodine interstitials appear as the most likely cause of the sub-bandgap defects observed by FTPS. Indeed, both positive I+i and negative iodine interstitials I−i have been shown to yield stable mid-bandgap defect levels (neutral Ii are predicted to be thermodynamically unstable).39 On the other hand, bromine interstitials form more shallow defects40 and are less stable. Furthermore, iodide is less tightly bound to Pb compared to bromide, and hence more likely to migrate.41 The other types of defects found in perovskites are also less likely to give rise to the sub-bandgap states measured by FTPS: I, FA or Pb vacancies (VI, VFA, VPb) are not predicted to introduce electronic states in the bandgap or they create only shallow levels according to DFT.42–44 FAI and IFA antisites can create deep levels within the bandgap of FA-based perovskites, but their formation in mixed cations perovskites (e.g. FACs or FAMA) should be mostly suppressed.43,44
The origin of deep defects in Ii is also supported by an experiment in ref. 45, where FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)/PbI2 stack was illuminated from the PbI2 side so that most of the light is absorbed in the PbI2 layer. The observed sub-bandgap FTPS signal increase in a perovskite layer, was explained by the diffusion of freed iodine species from the PbI2 film into the neighbouring perovskite, where they act as deep levels. Furthermore, a similar phenomenon was previously observed also on MAPbI3 in.23
Phase segregation mechanism
Upon LS, Frenkel pairs of Ii and VI are formed and diffuse within the grain in random directions. The light-induced Ii are most likely re-integrated into the lattice at grain boundaries/surfaces, which are characterised by an excess of unsaturated bonds/vacancies and act as sinks for charged defects.46 The Ii and VI diffusion coefficient of ∼2 × 10−9 cm2 s−1 (47,48) and average grain size of ∼200 nm enables their fast diffusion toward the grain surface within ∼50 ms. Excess iodide may form weaker Pb–I bonds at the grain boundaries, forming a non-homogenous layer, which is represented by the initial decrease in the slope of the absorption edge (Fig. 3a). Further accumulation of iodide on surfaces and at grain boundaries leads to the formation of the segregated I-rich phase 1 with x = 0.9, which manifests itself in the formation of a clearly distinguished inflection point at 1.58 eV (Fig. 3a). Furthermore, electron trapping at the positively charged I+i or hole trapping at the negatively charged I−i and subsequent reaction of two filled traps I0i can lead to the formation of an I2 molecules at the grain boundaries/surfaces. Their contribution may be seen in the FTPS spectra at 2.5 eV (see 7a and discussion in ESI: section 2.1†).49
VI also diffuses through the grain and with each jump moves lattice bromine or iodine to the opposite direction of its movement. The ratio of the diffusion current of lattice iodine JI and diffusion current of lattice bromine JBr is given by the ratio of iodine and bromine stoichiometry in mixed-halide perovskite APb(IxBr1−x)3: (1a) (1b)
Here x ϵ (0, 1) corresponds to the halide local stoichiometry coefficient and Jvac represents the diffusion current of VI, which is equal to the diffusion current of iodine interstitials Jint thanks to the same generation rate of Ii/VI and very similar diffusion constants.50 Since x < 1, the eqn. (1b) shows that the flux Jint of Ii facing to the surface is greater than the opposite flux of lattice iodine JI to the grain interior (Fig. 6a). This enables the formation of phase 1, which is governed by the total flux of lattice and interstitial iodine Jtot: (2)
 Fig. 6  Mechanism of phase segregation: (a) light-induced formation of Ii/VI pairs and principle of Ii accumulation at grain boundaries; (b) formation of an I-rich non-homogenous layer (marked with grey area), the perovskite phase 1 (marked with a yellow area) and a subsequent dissolution of iodine from phase 1/inhomogeneous layer slightly deeper into the perovskite grain interior; (c) formation of phase 2 (marked with green area). 
Consequently, an I-rich phase accumulates along the perovskite grain boundaries and surfaces, while an iodine-depleted region remains within the grain interior. This is in good accordance with.16,18,19,24,31,32,51–56 Reaching sites near grain boundaries by mobile iodides is moreover supported by accelerated Ii diffusion along the grain boundaries.52
From one grain, an estimated 40000 of iodine atoms are involved in the formation of phase 1 at 160 min of LS (see ESI†). Based on this estimation, the phase 1 does not evenly cover the entire grain surface and forms rather discontinuous islands at the interfaces of several grains where an enhanced disorder and amplified stress seed an optimal place for the new phase nucleation (see yellow area in Fig. 6b). This is in line with spatially resolved measurement in ref. 31, which was performed on mixed halide perovskites with an identical composition to ours. There, combining scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high-resolution cathodo-luminescence (CL) mapping showed that segregated I-rich phases are preferentially located near grain boundaries and form rather isolated clusters, than continuous layer along the grain boundary. Since the observed I-rich phase in ref. 31 may be attributed to phase 1, thanks to the identical PL redshift to 1.6 eV under LS, the ref. 31 confirms the proposed spatial arrangement of phase 1 in Fig. 6b.
In addition to the iodine concentrating in phase 1, iodine-rich regions at the grain boundaries, which do not form spatially resolved phase, should be anticipated, too (see grey area in 6b).
At longer times of LS, several samples show the formation of the I-rich phase 2 with x = 0.8, which is manifested in FTPS and PL spectra by a shoulder at 1.68 eV (Fig. 2 and 3a and S7†). Phase 2 must be formed by a different mechanism since the linear correlation between segregation and deep defect concentration ceases to apply (Fig. S9†). A combination of several underlying mechanisms may be involved in the formation of phase 2. Firstly, the accumulation of Ii at the grain boundaries leads to the second iodine concentration gradient Jint2, which is oriented to the grain interior (see Fig. 6b). Moreover, as the local stoichiometry coefficient x has a higher value on the surface due to the presence of phase 1, the flux of lattice iodine JI to the grain interior (caused by VI diffusion) increases (see eqn (1b), (2) and Fig. 6b). Furthermore, the formation of phase 1 with different lattice constant57 may lead to the mechanical strain between phase 1 and maternal phase.18 These processes allow iodine from the I-rich phase 1 at the grain boundaries or inhomogeneous layer to re-distribute slightly more into the grain interior, leading to the formation of a new phase 2 in close vicinity of the grain boundary/surface. Weakly bound iodine at grain boundaries/surfaces from inhomogeneous layer or iodine obtained after disintegration of an I2 molecule at grain surfaces must be also involved in the formation of phase 2 as the amount of phase 2 is 100× higher than the amount of phase 1. Phase 2 may, thanks to the ∼4 million of iodine atoms contributing from one grain, form a continuous layer along grain boundary/surface (Fig. 6c). This is consistent with spatially-resolved measurements on MA-based and Cs-based mixed halide perovskites.18,24,51,52
The observed drop in the concentration of deep level defects at longer times of LS (Fig. 3a-160 min) may be explained by the formation of I2/PbI2 from iodine interstitials. For other possible explanation see ESI: section 2.2.†
As seen in Fig. 3c and d by storing the PSCs in the dark, the concentration of deep-level traps generally gradually decreases. This decrease in defect concentration during relaxation in the dark was also recorded on MAPbI3 solar cells in ref. 58 and may be explained by the annihilation of iodine interstitials with iodine vacancies.59 The slower rate of recovery compared to the phase segregation rate when exposed to light may be due to the slower ionic conductivity in the dark.60 It is worth noting that some samples which were previously LS in OC conditions show an increase in defect concentration within the first 5 min of relaxation (Fig. 3c). The origin of such phenomenon is discussed in more details in the ESI.†
Our proposed mechanism of phase segregation based on iodine migration through interstitial sites agrees with ref. 50. However, the phase segregation process was also explained by a vacancy-mediated process in other publications focusing on thin films with a halide excess/deficiency.19–21 The stronger phase segregation observed in the case of an excess of halide vacancies has been so far explained by an increased number of available pathways for anion hopping via vacancies. However, we would like to mention that the efficacy of the phase segregation process depends also on the incorporation rate of halides into the lattice. Intentionally created excess halide vacancies (interstitials), primarily located at grain boundaries or surfaces,61 increase (reduce) the number of sites where the migrating iodides can be incorporated. Therefore, an interstitial-mediated anion migration process may also play a role in ref. 19–21. Light-induced Ii being the main migrating specie can also explain the discrepancy between spatially resolved LS measurements10,16,18,24,31,51,52 and Monte Carlo simulations in,20 which were based on the assumption that vacancies were explaining the process. While the experimental results showed that I-rich domains are preferentially located along grain boundaries leaving Br-rich phase in the grain interior, the Monte Carlo simulations in20 predicted the opposite arrangement with a Br-rich phase accumulating along boundaries/surfaces.
Variation in terminal phase
Studied SCs show two different trends upon LS varying in terminal phase. By comparing the FTPS evolution typical for both categories of samples with a terminal phase 1 (Fig. 4) and terminal phase 2 (Fig. 3), we see that deep defects evolve differently.
Within the first 5–20 min of LS, the deep defect concentration typically decreases in cells that end up with a terminal phase 1. This correlates well with an initial improvement in the photocurrent signal (see Fig. S10†), which is stronger in samples that end up with the terminal phase 1 (improvement by 25%) compared to samples which segregate to the terminal phase 2 (improvement by 5%). Such an initial signal enhancement, visible also in the PL (Fig. 2), FF and PCE trends (Fig. 1), may be explained in way that light-induced Ii passivate first deep defects present at grain boundaries, hence decreasing the population of non-radiative recombination centres. Once the concentration of light-induced Ii exceeds some threshold value needed for surface/grain boundaries passivation, they themselves start to form deep defects.62,63
At longer times of LS, we observe a simultaneous saturation of the deep level concentration and a segregation of the samples ending up with the terminal phase 1 (Fig. 4, S8†). This saturation is most probably caused by the dynamic equilibrium between the flow of light-induced Ii, diffusing from the grain interior towards its boundaries, and the flow of thermally released Ii, diffusing from the grain boundaries/surfaces to the volume. The idea of dynamic equilibrium is also supported by the segregation reversibility in the dark (Fig. 1 and 3), when only the flow of thermally released Ii, diffusing from the grain boundaries into the volume is present.
Another major difference lies in the evolution of above-bandgap part of the FTPS spectra, as seen in Fig. 7. In samples exhibiting two segregated phases upon LS, the illumination leads to the formation of a distinctive shoulder around 2.5 eV. Based on absorption spectra measurements in6,64,65 the shoulder at 2.5 eV may be attributed to the formation of I2 or PbI2.
 Fig. 7  Typical evolution of the above-bandgap FTPS signal under continuous AM1.5G illumination at open-circuit and subsequent recovery in the dark. The data was measured on samples ending up after LS with (a) terminal phase 2 and (b) terminal phase 1. 
Both categories of samples were prepared by the same process. However, deviations in the quality and morphology of perovskite films, may be expected. As discussed below, the differences in FTPS spectra may be explained by the presence of smaller grains in perovskites films ending up with the terminal phase 1 compared to those segregating to the terminal phase 2. To prove this, we acquired cross-sectional SEM images of studied solar cells, shown in Fig. 8. The sample segregating to the terminal phase 1 possesses ∼30% smaller grains/domains than the sample showing formation of both phases.
 Fig. 8  Cross-section SEM of mixed-halide perovskite solar cells. Images of a solar cell segregating to (a) and (c) terminal phase 2 and (b) and (d) terminal phase 1. The layers labelled 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are Au, Spiro-OMeTAD, FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3, mesoporous TiO2 and compact TiO2 layers, respectively. 
The smaller grains in samples with the terminal phase 1 should feature more defects associated with grain boundaries. As a result, the photocurrent enhancement and decline in deep defect concentration during the early stages of LS is the most pronounced in these samples (Fig. S10†), as here passivation effect shows up the most. Conversely, in samples ending up with the terminal phase 2, characterized by larger grains, a lower amount of iodine interstitials is necessary to passivate the lower number of defects present at grain boundaries.
The larger area of grain boundaries available in small grain-sized perovskites further enables a more even distribution and hence the lower mean density of light-induced Ii at grain boundaries upon LS. As the accumulation of Ii at grain boundaries seems to be necessary for the formation of phase 2 (see section ‘Phase segregation mechanism’), the difference in grain size and hence in grain boundaries surface may also explain the formation or absence of the terminal phase 2. Moreover, the high relative surface area in small grain-sized perovskites enhances the contribution of thermally-induced Ii from the surface. As a consequence, a dynamic equilibrium occurs for small grains more easily, terminating the segregation by phase 1. For even smaller grain sizes a complete suppression of phase segregation may occur. This is in line with current research66–68 in which phase segregation was found to take place only for an average mixed halide perovskite crystal size larger than ∼40 nm. Therefore, despite the fact that the surfaces/grain boundaries are inevitable for segregation, a suitable way how to suppress or fully reverse phase segregation may be to intentionally grow perovskites with a lower grain size. Still, such microstructures may deteriorate carrier transport, despite the positive effect of grain boundary defects passivation by light-induced Ii.
More significant accumulation of Ii at grain boundaries in samples with terminal phase 2, characterized by larger grain size, further increases the probability of an I2 or PbI2 formation. Suggested variation in crystallinity therefore also explains observed differences in the above-bandgap absorption and drop in deep level concentration at longer times of LS, which we associate with I2 or PbI2 formation. The larger the grains, the more pronounced shoulder at 2.5 eV can be therefore expected.
The dependence of phase segregation on grain size may be further demonstrated by a simple diffusion model for Ii, generated by light with rate G, in a spherical grain of radius R (see ESI†). A steady state solution of the diffusion eqn S(2)† leads to the dependence of the concentration of iodine interstitials Ci on the square of radius R: (3)
As further follows from the eqn S(5),† the diffusion current of Ii at the grain surface Jint depends directly on the grain size R: (4)
The larger the grain, the higher the flux Jint flows to the boundary, which increases the iodine accumulation at grain boundaries and hence the likelihood of phase 2 formation.
Conclusions
We studied the phase segregation process occurring in FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 solar cells caused by light soaking. Whole devices with FA- and Cs-based mixed-halide perovskites exhibited a slower phase segregation compared to literature observations reported in6,20,27 for MAPb(Ix,Bry)3 thin films. The slow process observed here enabled us to record that the generally observed I-rich terminal phase (I0.8Br0.2) is preceded by an even lower bandgap phase (I0.9Br0.1). Several samples, however, do not segregate to the I-rich phase (I0.8Br0.2), even at longer times of LS. The different patterns of phase segregation, with variations in the iodine content of the terminal phase, are likely to result from differences in the perovskite grain size. FTPS spectra further reveal that deep defects form in FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 solar cells under continuous illumination. A correlation between phase segregation rate and deep defect-formation suggests that light-induced deep defects promote phase segregation by acting as the main halide migration channel. We connect phase segregation with iodine transport via interstitial sites. Based on our results, an effective way to suppress or even fully reverse phase segregation may be to reduce the perovskite grain size.
Materials and methods
Materials
The pre-patterned fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates (10 Ω sq−1) were purchased from Solaronix. Lead iodide (PbI2) was purchased from TCI Chemicals. Titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75 wt% in isopropanol), formamidium iodide (FAI), cesium iodide (CsI), lead bromide (PbBr2), acetonitrile, lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI), chlorobenzene, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 4-tert-butyl pyridine, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Titanium dioxide paste (30 NR-D) was purchased from Greatcellsolar and 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di-(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD) was purchased from Lumtec. All the chemicals were used as received without further purification.
Solar cell preparation
Solar cells were prepared on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates, on which 30 nm-thick compact TiO2 was deposited as the electron transport layer (ETL) by spray pyrolysis at 450 °C. Substrates were then sintered at 500 °C for 30 min and left to cool down slowly to room temperature. A 150 nm thick mesoporous TiO2 layer was deposited by spin coating at 4000 rpm for 20 s using a diluted 30 nm TiO2 nanoparticle paste in anhydrous ethanol. After spin coating, the substrates were immediately dried on a hot plate at 100 °C for 10 min and then sintered at 500 °C for 60 min. The perovskite films were deposited from a precursor solution which was prepared by dissolving FAI (0.143 g), CsI (0.044 g), PbI2 (0.184 g), PbBr2 (0.220 g) in 1 × 10−3 L of solvent of DMF:DMSO = 4:1 under constant stirring at 70 °C. The perovskite solution was spin-coated on the substrate at 1000 rpm for 10 s and 5000 rpm for 30 s. The antisolvent, chlorobenzene (150 × 10−6 L), was dropped on the spinning substrate 10 s before the end of the second step. The samples were subsequently annealed at 100 °C for 30 min in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. The hole transport layer (HTL) layer was prepared by spin-coating 50 × 10−6 L of a spiro-MeOTAD solution at 4000 rpm for 30 s on top of the perovskite layer. The spiro-MeOTAD solution was prepared by dissolving 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene in chlorobenzene (72.3 g L−1) with the addition of 28.8 × 10−6 L of 4-tert-butyl pyridine and 17.5 × 10−6 L of Li-TFSI solution in 1 × 10−3 L of acetonitrile. Finally, the 80 nm-thick Au top electrode was thermally evaporated in high vacuum.
Measurements
Light soaking of cells was done using a continuous Xe lamp A1020 from AMKO adjusted to 1000 W m−2 in one of three modes: at OC, SC or MPP. The LS sequence, used for J–V, PL and FTPS measurements, is shown in Fig. S1.† All times stated in the article are cumulative. Individual measurements between LS times took a maximum of five minutes and were measured directly after switching off the illumination. A new pristine sample was used for each LS sequence.
Fourier-transform photocurrent spectroscopy
The FTPS signal is given by photo-carriers (both electrons and holes) generated in the photovoltaic absorber and subsequently collected by the external electrodes under applied or built-in bias. The basic principles of this method are described in detail elsewhere.69,70 Here, the FTPS measurements were performed with a Thermo Nicolet 8700 Fourier-Transform Infrared spectrometer from Thermo Scientific equipped with an 80 W external halogen light source from NARVA. For solar cells, a SR570 current preamplifier from Stanford Research Systems was used in low noise mode with 10 μA V−1–200 nA V−1 pre-amplification and no external voltage was applied to the devices. The spectral range was divided into three partly overlapping measurements separated by long-pass colour filters in order to extend the dynamic range. The first measurement was made using only a mesh filter to reduce the illumination intensity 30 times. The following two measurements were performed with long-pass glass filters from Quantum Design at cut-off wavelengths of 780 nm and 850 nm. All measurements were taken in a cryostat with optical windows in a nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature in order to minimize degradation due to humidity and oxygen.71
Photoluminescence
PL measurements were performed by using Cary Eclipse Fluorescent Spectrophotometer from Agilent with additional xenon lamp adjusted for one-sun illumination for light soaking process. Samples were kept in the DN2 cryostat chamber from Oxford Instruments equipped with electrical contacts and filled with nitrogen at room temperature to minimize the effect of ambient air atmosphere. The excitation wavelength was set to 440 nm and the PL signal was collected in the range of 550–950 nm.
SEM imaging
The cross-section view images of the cells were carried out by ultra-high resolution SEM MAIA3 from TESCAN Brno, using an electron energy of 5 keV and an in-lens secondary electron detector. All samples were in their pristine state without any conductive coating.
X-ray diffraction
The powder patterns were collected using a Rigaku Smartlab diffractometer equipped with a rotating 9 kW Cu anode, primary and secondary Soller slits (5 degree), and a 1D detector. The measurements were carried out in Bragg–Brentano geometry using Johansson primary Kα1 monochromator (λ = 0.15406 nm). To avoid the degradation of the perovskite layer in the ambient air, the new pristine sample was cut into several pieces and they were separately stored and illuminated in a capsule filled with nitrogen prior to the experiment in an ambient atmosphere. Immediately after illumination, the sample was aligned in the diffractometer and measured. To ensure that the collected powder pattern is not affected by the sample degradation, the diffraction peaks at 28.2 degree and 32.3 degree were measured in static mode (5 min) before and after the main data collection by Bragg–Brentano θ–2θ scan (30 min).

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Evolution of normalised PV parameters extracted from J–V curves measured under 1 Sun illumination and during relaxation in the dark. Starting from the top, the open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, fill factor and power conversion efficiency trends are illustrated. Solar cells were held at either open-circuit, short-circuit or MPP condition during light soaking.	 

 	Fig. 2  Evolution of PL spectra under a 1 Sun illumination when the cell is light-soaked at (a) open-circuit and (b) short-circuit.	 

 	Fig. 3  Fourier-transform photocurrent spectra showing the effect of a continuous AM1.5G illumination on cells held at (a) open-circuit and (b) short-circuit conditions. FTPS data during the relaxation of the devices previously light soaked in (c) open-circuit and (d) short-circuit conditions.	 

 	Fig. 4  Fourier-transform photocurrent spectra showing the effect of continuous AM1.5G LS on a cell held at open-circuit. Phase 2 did not form and the FTPS intensity at the energy of sub-bandgap states increased upon LS.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Evolution of non-normalised FTPS photocurrent signals obtained at fixed photon energies 1.45 eV and 1.6 eV during LS; (b) correlation between deep level concentration (given by the photocurrent at 1.45 eV) and phase segregation (given by the photocurrent at 1.6 eV).

 	Fig. 6  Mechanism of phase segregation: (a) light-induced formation of Ii/VI pairs and principle of Ii accumulation at grain boundaries; (b) formation of an I-rich non-homogenous layer (marked with grey area), the perovskite phase 1 (marked with a yellow area) and a subsequent dissolution of iodine from phase 1/inhomogeneous layer slightly deeper into the perovskite grain interior; (c) formation of phase 2 (marked with green area).	 

 	Fig. 7  Typical evolution of the above-bandgap FTPS signal under continuous AM1.5G illumination at open-circuit and subsequent recovery in the dark. The data was measured on samples ending up after LS with (a) terminal phase 2 and (b) terminal phase 1.	 

 	Fig. 8  Cross-section SEM of mixed-halide perovskite solar cells. Images of a solar cell segregating to (a) and (c) terminal phase 2 and (b) and (d) terminal phase 1. The layers labelled 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are Au, Spiro-OMeTAD, FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3, mesoporous TiO2 and compact TiO2 layers, respectively.
