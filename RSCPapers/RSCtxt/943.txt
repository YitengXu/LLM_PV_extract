    , Accepted 25th February 2011First published on 14th March 2011AbstractBased upon the bis(2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline)copper(I/II) electron mediator, we present an iodine-free dye-sensitized solar cell exhibiting an impressive power conversion efficiency of 7.0% at 100 mW cm−2 air mass global (AM1.5G) conditions, which rivals that of a control cell with a conventional iodine redox couple.
The iodide/triiodide redox shuttle, as an unparalleled option in formulating efficient electrolytes of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) so far, is of paramount importance in achieving the validated efficiency record of 11.1%.1 To pursue further device improvement, the ordinary iodine electrolytes have however presented some prominent constraints on the development of new photosensitizers, semiconductors and counter electrodes.2 In this regard, intense efforts have been made to exploit alternative redox couples such as halogens, pseudohalogens and some one-electron compounds.3 In 2005, a series of blue copper model complexes were first examined for their effectiveness as redox mediators in DSCs by Yanagida and coworkers,3h affording a maximum incident photon-to-collected electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) of ∼40%, which is thought to stem from a slow regeneration of the N3 ruthenium photosensitizer owing to the large reorganization energies of copper(I/II) complexes.4 Despite the superior photovoltage generated by a bis(2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline)copper (Cu(dmp)2, Fig. S1A)† electrolyte as compared to an iodine congener, only 1.4% efficiency was realized under the full sunlight illumination.3h In this paper, we revisit the Cu(dmp)2 redox shuttle in combination with a bilayer titania thin-film stained with a high-absorption-coefficient organic photosensitizer C218 (Fig. S1B)† characteristic of sluggish charge recombination5 and present an iodine-free DSC displaying an impressive solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency of 7.0% at the 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G conditions, which rivals that of 6.5% for a control cell based on the traditional iodine redox shuttle.
Our copper electrolyte is composed of 0.2 M Cu(dmp)2TFSI, 0.05 M Cu(dmp)2TFSI chloride, 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) and 0.1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) in acetonitrile.†Bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI) is selected herein as the anion of copper complexes to ensure their good solubilities in common electrolyte solvents. An iodine control electrolyte is also formulated as follows: 0.2 M 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide, 0.05 M iodine, 0.5 M TBP and 0.1 M LiTFSI in acetonitrile. The cell fabrication details are presented in the ESI.†Photocurrent action spectra (Fig. 1A) of our cells were first recorded. A broad ∼87% IPCE plateau in the spectral coverage from 460 to 580 nm is observed for a typical cell with the iodine control electrolyte. Further alternation of the redox shuttle with copper leads to a reduction of IPCEs in the whole visible region, with a IPCE summit of ∼80%. An even sharper contrast of IPCEs in the blue region can be noted from the normalized photocurrent action spectra (Fig. S2A).† This can be ascribed to stronger absorptions of the copper electrolyte than the iodine control (Fig. S2B),† which compete with the dye absorption but do not contribute to charge generation.
 Fig. 1  (A) Photocurrent action spectra and (B) J–V characteristics under irradiation of 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM1.5G sunlight. Cells were tested using a metal mask with an aperture area of 0.158 cm2. An antireflection film was adhered to the testing cell during measurements. 
We also measured photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics (Fig. 1B) and collected the detailed cell parameters in Table S1.† The short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) of the copper cell under irradiation of 100 mW cm−2 are 11.29 mA cm−2, 932 mV and 0.66, respectively, generating an impressive power conversion efficiency (η) of 7.0%. Under a series of weaker light illuminations, the copper cell displays even better efficiencies up to 7.8%. This can be rationalized in terms of a slightly nonlinear dependence of photocurrent on light intensity, indicating that the photocurrent under full sunlight may be still limited by the mass transport of copper(II) cations to some extent.3h In agreement with the preceding IPCE data, an increased Jsc of 13.74 mA cm−2 is attained upon utilization of the iodine electrolyte. However, owing to a remarkably diminished Voc of 714 mV, the iodine cell has a lower η of 6.5%. Overall, the efficiency improvement by the redox shuttle alternation from iodine to copper is dominantly contributed by the remarkable 218 mV improvement of Voc. The Voc in DSCs can be described as shown in eqn 16 (1)where Ec is the titania conduction band edge, EF,redox is the electrolyte Fermi-level, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, nc is the free electron density and Nc of 7 × 1020 cm−3 used here is the density of accessible states in the titania conduction band.
Thereby, we measured the electrical impedance spectroscopy of the copper and iodine cells, from which the chemical capacitance (Cμ) can be derived through numerical simulation with a proper equivalent circuit.7a The Ec − EF,redox values are derived to be 1.38 and 1.04 eV for the copper and iodine cells by fitting the Cμ data in Fig. 2A according to the relationship in eqn 27b (2)where e is the elementary charge, d is the film thickness, p is the film porosity, Nt of 2 × 1020 cm−3 optionally selected here is the total density of surface states, Tc is a characteristic temperature depicting the trap state distribution profile and V is the potential bias during EIS measurements. Obviously, the 0.34 eV variation of Ec–EF,redox in contrast to the experimentally observed Voc enhancement of ∼0.22 V suggests a reduced nc in the titania film by changing the redox mediator from iodine to copper. Actually, nc is intimately associated with the nonlinear interfacial charge recombination Un7c (eqn 3) Un = k0ncβ(3)where k0 is the apparent rate constant and β is the reaction order for electrons in the titania film. Noting that the charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the titania/electrolyte interface can also be derived from impedance spectroscopies and expressed as8 (4)where A is the titania film area, we fitted the Rct data (Fig. 2A) to eqn 4 to obtain the values of β (copper: 0.36; iodine: 0.66) and k0 (copper: 2.5 × 1014 cm−3(1–β) s−1; iodine: 6.1 × 109 cm−3(1–β) s−1). As shown in Fig. 2B, with respect to the iodine electrolyte, the copper congener evokes a much faster interfacial charge recombination at a given free electron density.

To understand the IPCE height difference of the copper and iodine cells, transient absorption measurements were carried out to scrutinize the dual-channel charge transfer kinetics of the oxidized C218 dye molecules, i.e., their interception by either titania electrons or electron-donating species in electrolytes.4,9 A transient absorption spectrum of the C218 dye (Fig. 3A) was first measured with an ICCD camera, which features positive absorption changes in two broad wavelength ranges of 375–525 and 683–900 nm. For an alternative account of the sensitivity of our PMT detector, a probe light at 782 nm was chosen here for kinetic measurements. In the presence of an inert electrolyte composed of 0.1 M LiTFSI and 0.5 M TBP in acetonitrile, the slow decay trace a in Fig. 3B can be attributed to the charge recombination reaction between the oxidized C218 dye molecules and titania electrons. However, upon utilization of the realistic copper (trace b) and iodine (trace c) electrolytes, absorption decays are significantly accelerated, indicative of expeditious electron donations from both copper(I) and iodide ions to the oxidized dye molecules. Fitting the decay traces to a stretched-exponential function (mΔOD∝exp[–(t/τ)α]) affords half-lifetimes (t1/2) of the oxidized C218 in the inert (3400 μs), copper (12 μs) and iodine (16 μs) electrolytes. In spite of the slightly dissimilar dye regeneration kinetics, the branch ratios of the dual-channel charge transfer kinetics are over 210 for both redox shuttles, bringing on negligible influences on the IPCE summits.

(B) Kinetic traces in the (a) inert, (b) copper and (c) iodine electrolytes of a 10 μm thick, C218-coated titania film. Smooth lines are stretched exponential fittings over raw data obtained by averaging 800 laser shots. Excitation fluence and wavelength: 44 μJ cm−2 at 665 nm. 
We further resorted to the time-correlated single-photon counting technique to examine the electron injection yield (ηinj), which may influence the IPCE height.10 We first employed a C218-coated alumina film and the copper or iodine electrolyte to fabricate a control cell, which has a strong red emission upon laser excitation. The dashed decay traces shown in Fig. S3† can be ascribed to the radiative and non-radiative deactivation of excited-state dye molecules grafted on alumina, in virtue of the absence of a favorable energy alignment for electron injection at the alumina/dye interface. However, a substitution of alumina with titania strikingly attenuates the emission intensity, arising from electron injection from excited-state dye molecules to titania. Through integrals of the emission traces of the dye-coated titania film with respect to those of alumina, we estimated the ηinj values to be 89% and 93% for the copper and iodine cells, respectively, accounting for the aforementioned variation in IPCE maxima. To elaborate the thermodynamics behind the electrolyte-dependent electron injection yields, we measured square-wave voltammograms (Fig. S4)† of ferrocene with a copper or iodine reference electrode, and derived their EF,redox values to be −5.16 and −4.86 eV versus vacuum. In combination with the preceding Ec–EF,redox values, we obtained a 0.04 eV higher Ec level of the titania film in contact with the copper electrolyte than that of the iodine counterpart, which could supply a smaller driving force for electron injection.
To summarize, the feasibility of employing the bis(2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline)copper(I/II) redox shuttle for a 7.0% efficiency dye-sensitized solar cell free of a corrosive iodine electrolyte has been demonstrated by virtue of a mesoporous titania thin-film, coated with a high-absorption-coefficient organic photosensitizer. However, the copper redox shuttle was also found to display very low electron transfer rates on several noble metals, carbon black and conducting oxides, resulting in the poor fill factor presented in this work. We anticipate that a remarkable efficiency enhancement of iodine-free DSCs could be achieved in the near future, through judicious selection of high-activity counter electrodes, wide-spectral-response photosensitizers and other copper phenanthroline complexes.11
