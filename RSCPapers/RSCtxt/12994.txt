    , Accepted 11th December 2018First published on 11th December 2018AbstractThe aluminum nitride (AlN) powder/thin films were prepared from an aluminum–urea complex. The complex, hexa urea aluminate(III) chloride, has proven to be a potential single source precursor to aluminum nitrides because urea molecules construct a coordination sphere around the metal atom and form a stable structure, compared with air sensitive halide and hydride precursors. The precursor and the spin coated thin films of the precursor on quartz and Si(100) substrates were pyrolysed at various temperatures (800 °C to 1000 °C) and pressure (100 Torr to 1 Torr) under nitrogen atmosphere. The pyrolysed powders/films were characterized by FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared) spectroscopy, TGA (Thermogravimetric analysis), PXRD (Powder X-ray Diffraction), FESEM (Field emission scanning electron microscopy), UV-Vis (Ultra violet-Visible spectroscopy), etc. The XRD results show that the polycrystalline aluminum nitride was obtained at a temperature of 1000 °C and at 1 Torr pressure. The average crystallites size calculated from XRD were in the range of 20–10 nm, which decreased with increase of pyrolysis temperature. We also conducted the pyrolysis process under argon instead of nitrogen and found that most of the nitrogen came from urea for the formation of AlN but the nitrogen atmosphere favoured clean formation of AlN. The band gaps of the deposited films were found in the range of 5.1–6.2 eV.
1. Introduction
Group III–V compound semiconductors and their alloys attract considerable interest for applications in a wide range of nano materials, solid state electronic and optoelectronic devices due to their excellent physical and chemical properties.1 Some of the main III–V compound semiconductor elements and their tertiary and quaternary alloys such as gallium nitride (GaN), indium phosphide (InP), indium nitride (InN), aluminum nitride (AlN), gallium phosphide (GaP), gallium arsenide (GaAs), aluminum gallium arsenide (AlGaAs), indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs), aluminum gallium nitride (AlGaN), aluminum indium gallium phosphide (AlInGaP) have attracted growing interest for applications in III–V solar cells,2,3 high performance electronics and semiconductor industries, and also exhibit excellent potential applications in wireless communications, computers, laptops, inverters, TV remotes, packaging, and high power electronics. These alloys have many technological applications like AlGaN and InGaN used in high brightness LEDs,4 UV-LEDs, laser diodes (LDs),5 full color outdoor electroluminescent displays, high efficiency solar cells, high temperature and high frequency field effect transistors (FETs), high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs), and UV detectors in the aerospace industry. The group III–V materials have capability to absorb entire visible and near UV spectrum due to their high band gap energy in the range of 0.7–6.2 eV6 with the additional advantages of high thermal conductivity, high melting point, mechanical resistance, and high temperature stability. Currently, III–V semiconductors completely replace silicon in space satellites where high efficiency power sources used for the production of electricity. Group III metals strongly bind to nitrogen, which results in high thermal stability, and unique physical and chemical properties.
AlN is one of the III–V nontoxic semiconductor materials with a hexagonal and thermodynamically stable Wurtzite crystal structure. It has a large direct band gap of 6.2 eV, high thermal conductivity (320 W m−1 K−1), high decomposition temperature (∼2700 K), and it is chemically inert and transparent in the visible and near infrared regions. Because of these properties, AlN thin films have great potential for applications in microelectronic and optoelectronic devices.7,8 Gallium nitride (GaN) has a direct band gap of 3.4 eV and a predicted large saturated electron drift velocity. The group III–V semiconductor materials such as AlN and GaN have piezoelectric properties and high acoustic velocities that make them attractive for use in acoustic devices, and alloys of the group III-nitrides, such as AlGaN and GaInN, have potential applications in microelectronics and optoelectronics.9
Several techniques have been reported in recent literature for the preparation of metal nitrides, such as direct nitridation of the element,10,11 oxide12 and halide routes,13 plasma-based processes,14,15 and heat-treatment of organometallic precursors under ammonia gas.16 The most critical factors in the synthesis of group III–V metal nitrides are the starting materials and the substrates.
The main problem for the advancement of GaN and AlN device technology is the absence of suitable substrates, which could not be obtained as bulk crystals due to an extremely high equilibrium pressure of nitrogen at their growth temperatures.17 It is necessary to grow GaN and AlN thin films heteroepitaxially on various substrates, among which sapphire and silicon were the most popular materials for the preparation of large area films. The majority of III–V thin films have been grown by using conventional precursors such as trimethylaluminum (TMA), trimethylgallium (TMG) and trimethyl indium (TMI) and their derivatives by MOCVD under the flow of nitrogen or ammonia gas.18 Metal hydrides and halides were also used to prepare group III–V metal nitrides at high temperatures. However, these precursors are highly pyrophoric and toxic in nature and hence require considerable skill to handle them. The major obstacles associated with such high growth temperatures include the introduction of thermal stress in the films, the accumulation of defects at the interface, and poor compatibility with existing integrated circuit technology. Therefore, a low growth temperature is essential to prepare defect free thin films. The recent practice of using single source precursors in CVD benefits from low deposition temperatures and accurate stoichiometry in many cases.19–30 The single molecular precursors such as Al(N3)3,19 [(CH3)2AlNH2]3,20 [(Et)2AlNH2]3,21 [(Et)2AlN3]3,22 (CH3)3NAlH3,23 [(CH3)2Al(NHiPr)]2,24 [Et2AlNHtBu]2,25 [(Et)2GaN3]3,26 M2[N(CH3)2]6 (M = Al, Ga),27 [H2GaNH2]3,28 [(CH3)2GaNHtBu]2,29 [(Et)2GalNH2]3,30 and hydrazidoalane dimers, [Me2Al-μ-N(H)NMe2]2 and [Et2Al-μ-N(H)NMe2]231 have been used for the preparation of AlN and GaN thin films, but these precursors have handling and storage issues. Furthermore, most of the precursors undergo facile cleavage at the M–N (M = Al, Ga) bond at low temperatures, limiting the use as single source precursors for MN thin films.
Recently, researchers have been utilizing urea/metal halide complexes as single source precursors for the preparation of metal nitrides32 and found that the metal urea complexes are versatile single source precursors for the preparation of metal nitrides. Ayako Kai et al. used urea–aluminum chloride complex for the joining of AlN ceramic plate.33 C. N. R. Rao et al. prepared metal nitride nanocrystallites (M = Al, Ga, In) via solvothermal routes.34 Yu Qiu et al. have synthesized nanocrystalline GaN powder using Ga(III) urea complex under CVD conditions at a temperature range of 600–900 °C.35 Most of the researchers used metal urea complexes for the study of metal nitrides with respect to temperature and flow of nitrogen and ammonia gases. To the best of our knowledge, nobody has studied the effect of pressure, temperature and gases on the formation of AlN by CVD of the hexa urea aluminate(III) complex.
The purpose of this work was to study the effect of temperature, pressure and gas on the conversion of precursors to bulk AlN as well as thin films with respect to structural and optical properties.
In this work, we studied the effect of temperature, pressure and flow rates of inert gases for the conversion of hexaurea aluminum(III) precursor to aluminum nitrate (AlN) powder/thin films. In this connection we carried out a series of experiments and pyrolysed the precursor by varying temperature, pressure and flow rates of inert gases. The AlN thin films were also prepared by spin coating the precursor i.e. hexaurea aluminate(III) chloride on a Si(100) substrate and pyrolysed in a CVD reactor under similar conditions. In this technique, it is well accepted that the properties of the powder/films depend on pyrolysis conditions such as substrate temperature, working pressure, and gas flow rates. In general, the procedure for pyrolysis consists of varying one parameter at a time while keeping all others fixed, in an attempt to maximize a given thin-film property.
2. Experimental
2.1 Material and methods
Aluminium chloride (AlCl3, 99.99% pure), urea (NH2CONH2, 99.99% pure), and ethanol (CH3CH2OH, purity 99.99%) were purified using standard procedures and nitrogen (N2) and argon (Ar) were used for the preparation of single source precursor as well as for the preparation of AlN thin films by OMVPE. All materials are commercially available. AlN thin films were prepared on precleaned quartz and Si(100) substrates. The Si substrate was ultrasonically cleaned in 2-propanol, acetone or methanol with DI water and further treated with hydrofluoric acid for ∼1 minute to remove native oxygen from the substrate, rinsed with DI water and dried under nitrogen (N2) atmosphere.
2.2 Synthesis of hexa urea aluminate(III) chloride complex [2P]
The single source precursor hexa urea aluminate(III) chloride complex has been synthesized as depicted in Scheme 1. In a typical procedure, AlCl3 (1.33 g) was dissolved in 30 mL ethanol under inert atmosphere and urea (3.6 g in 20 mL ethanol) was added drop wise with constant stirring in a three necked round bottom flask. The reaction mixture was refluxed at 80 °C for 5 h. A white solid precipitated, and the reaction mixture was cooled, filtered, washed with ethanol and dried under vacuum. Yield, 4.00 g, 81%.

2.3 Pyrolysis studies of hexa urea aluminate(III) chloride complex (2P)
We have designed a series of experiments to optimize the pyrolysis of precursor under CVD conditions for the formation of AlN thin films and bulk materials by varying temperature, pressure and gas flow rates of inert gases. In this regard, the synthesized complex [2P] was pyrolysed under CVD conditions at different temperatures (500 °C, 800 °C, 900 °C, 1000 °C) and pressures (100 T, 50 T, 10 T, 5 T, 1 T) under inert atmosphere to study the formation of AlN powder. In a typical procedure, the complex was placed in an alumina boat and kept in a horizontal reactor equipped with a controlled vacuum system, and the flow of N2/Ar gas (100–200 SCCM) was maintained throughout the experiment. The temperature of the reactor was raised from room temperature to 1000 °C (depending upon the design of experiments). The duration of pyrolysis was fixed at 60 minutes for all experiments. After completion of pyrolysis, the reactor was cooled down to room temperature under inert atmosphere and the pyrolysed product was taken out from the reactor. AlN thin films were deposited on precleaned Si(100) wafers and quartz glass by spin coating the synthesized complex (2P), and then pyrolysing in a CVD reactor under similar conditions as discussed for the powders.
These pyrolysed powders and thin films were characterized by modern spectroscopic techniques. The properties of pyrolysed powders followed by their sample code with temperature and pressure were given in Table 1.

2.4 Instrumentation
The synthesized complex and its pyrolysed products were characterized by various spectroscopic techniques such as Fourier Transform-Infrared Spectroscopy (Perkin Elmer FTIR spectrometer) in the range of 4000–400 cm−1. Thermogravimetric analysis was performed by a TA instrument (TA instrument USA model Q 500) with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in nitrogen atmosphere. Mass spectra of the precursors were recorded by ESIMS (WATERS Q-TOF Premier-HAB213). The crystal structure and grain size were calculated by powder X-ray diffraction (PAN-analytical Xpert Powder) with Cu-K-alpha radiation. The morphology of materials was studied by FESEM (JSM7100F) along with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). The band gap energy of AlN thin films were investigated by Ultra-violet-Visible spectroscopy (Cary-5000 Uv-Vis-NIR, Agilent). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of AlN films were carried out using a model PHI5000Versa Probe II instrument.
3. Results and discussion
The hexa urea aluminate(III) is a versatile single source precursor for the preparation of aluminum nitride (AlN). The precursor hexa urea aluminate(III) chloride (Fig. 1) was prepared by the reaction of urea and aluminum chloride with a metal to ligand molar ratio of 1:6 in ethanol. The precipitated white crude product was washed with ethanol and dried under vacuum yielding 81% white crystalline powder.
3.1 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis
The FT-IR spectra of the precursor and its pyrolysed powders prepared at various temperatures and pressures are shown (Fig. 2a and b). In Fig. 2a, the IR spectrum of neat urea (A) shows the symmetrical peak of NH2 at 3450 cm−1, a sharp peak at 1635 cm−1 corresponding to the carbonyl group ν(CO) of urea, and a peak at 1441 cm−1 attributed to ν(C–NH2). In Fig. 2a, the IR spectrum (B) is of the synthesized aluminum urea complex with peaks at 1646 cm−1 and 1463 cm−1, which corresponds to ν(CO) and ν(C–N), respectively. Both peaks were shifted by ∼15–20 cm−1 revealing that the urea molecule coordinated with aluminum through oxygen during the formation of the aluminum–urea chloride complex. The IR spectra shown in Fig. 2a. (C) and (D) are of the pyrolysed products of the precursor at temperatures 800 °C, 900 °C and 1 Torr pressure, respectively. The IR spectra of C & D shows the appearance of a new peak at 2170 cm−1, which corresponds to Al–N2 bonding32 and other peaks generated at 800 cm−1 and 783 cm−1 can be attributed to the formation of nanocrystalline Al–N.36
 Fig. 2  The FT-IR spectra of (a) – [A] neat urea, [B] synthesized complex, [C] pyrolysed at 800 °C [D] 900 °C and (b) its heat-treatment powder at [E] 1000 °C–100 T–100 SCCM, [F] 1000 °C–10 T–100 SCCM, [G] 1000 °C–1 T–100 SCCM, [H] 1000 °C–1 T–200 SCCM. 
We pyrolysed precursor under reduced pressures (100–1 T) and temperature (1000 °C) to understand the complete mechanism of the formation of AlN from the urea–aluminum complex. The IR spectra in Fig. 2b E to H show the continuous changes in peaks as we increase temperature and gas flow rate, and decrease the pressure. The IR spectra E, F, G, and H are designated 1000 °C–100 Torr–100 SCCM, 1000 °C–10 Tor–100 SCCM, 1000 °C–1 Torr–100 SCCM and 1000 °C–1 Torr–200 SCCM, respectively. It is observed from the IR studies that at 1000 °C the pressure plays a crucial role for the formation of AlN materials in bulk as well as thin films. It can be observed from the above experiments that as we vary temperature and pressure, the intensities of the νN–H peak at 3450 cm−1 and the νAl–N2 peak at 2170 cm−1 decreased and the peak of νAl–N appeared at ∼728 cm−1, which was shifted 20 cm−1 compared to that of the bulk (674–706) cm−1.37,38 The increase in the energy can be associated with the lower dimensionality of the materials.32,36 The spectra in Fig. 2b G and H show the disappearance of the peak at 1680 cm−1 due to νCO, which confirms the loss of the CO moiety from the complex. It has also been found that on increasing gas flow rate from 100 to 200 SCCM, only the sharp peak of AlN appears, which means it affects the crystal quality. Similar experiments were also carried out under argon atmosphere to study the effect of inert gases (Fig. 2b(H)) and found that there is no change in the peak of Al–N2 at 2170 cm−1 but a small residue of carbon was left over, which indicates the incomplete conversion of the precursor to AlN. Hence by this experiment it is clearly observed that most of the nitrogen comes from the ligand for the formation of AlN, however, the use of nitrogen gas facilitates the formation of pure AlN. This study reveals that at a temperature of 1000 °C and at reduced pressures both amination and nitridation take place in the formation of AlN.39
3.2 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
The TGA thermogram shown in (Fig. 3) were recorded for the thermogravimetry analysis of aluminum–urea complex as well as its pyrolysed materials at various temperatures and pressures (100–1 T). The TGA thermogram of the precursor [Al(NH2CONH2)6Cl3] revealed that most of the organic moieties decomposed at temperatures between 350 °C and 500 °C and left a residue of 8–10% at 800–1000 °C, which corresponds to the formation of AlN. From the TGA thermogram, it is clear that the conversion of the precursor to AlN takes place at a temperature of 1000 °C under N2 atmosphere. Keeping this in mind, we have conducted a series of pyrolysis experiments under CVD conditions by varying the temperature (800–1000 °C) and pressure (100–1 T) under N2 atmosphere. The obtained residues were analysed by TGA to understand the decomposition mechanism for the conversion of the precursor to AlN. TGA data of the precursor pyrolysed at a temperature of 900 °C shows a 34% weight loss indicating that at this temperature, some organic moieties are associated with AlN. However, the precursor pyrolysed at 1000 °C under varying pressure (100–1 T) shows weight losses at 100 T, 50 T, and 10 T that were found to be about 25%, 12% and 10%, respectively, which indicates that some part of the ligand is still associated with AlN, whereas the precursor pyrolysed at 1000 °C, 1 T pressure gives only 4–5% weight loss, which is due to moisture. This clearly indicates that almost all precursors have converted to AlN. FT-IR studies also confirm the decomposition pattern at various temperatures and pressures (discussed earlier). From the TGA study, it is clearly observed that pressure plays a crucial role for the conversion of precursor to AlN, and shows that the lower pressure favours the formation of AlN from the precursor at elevated temperatures, whereas higher pressures lead to incomplete decomposition of the precursor. At a temperature of 1000 °C and a reduced pressure of 1 T, the precursor completely converted into AlN.

3.3 Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD)
The crystallographic study of the precursor as well as their pyrolysed powders at various temperatures and pressures were shown in Fig. 4. The crystal structures of the precursor as well as the pyrolysed powder obtained at various temperatures and pressures were investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (PAN-analytical Xpert Powder) using Cu Kα (1.5406 Å) radiation. Fig. 4(a) shows the XRD spectra of the as synthesized precursor and its pyrolysed powders at 800 °C and 900 °C at 1 Torr pressure and under N2 atmosphere. In Fig. 4(a), the synthesized precursor showed various peaks that could be attributed to aluminium surrounded by ligand moities. The XRD spectra of the pyrolysed powder obtained at 800 °C and 1 T shows the amorphous nature, whereas the XRD pattern of the pyrolysed powder obtained at 900 °C, 1 T pressure shows the broad crystalline peak of carbon impurities at 2θ = 25° and a sharp peak at 66.5°. The crystallinity and crystallographic orientation of the grain started to visibly improve after pyrolysing at 1000 °C and varying the pressure (100 T, 50 T, 10 T, 5 T, and 1 T) for 1 h yielding crystalline phases of AlN, which were shown in Fig. 4(b). When the precursor was heated at 1000 °C with 100 T pressure, various peaks were observed (2θ = 25°, 43.2° and 52.1°) that corresponded to carbon, Al and AlON impurities, respectively. The XRD peaks became more prominent as we varied pressure (50 T, 10 T, 5 T) at 1000 °C. The intensity of the peaks (Al and AlON) decreases and the growth and crystallinity of AlN with a hexagonal structure improves at orientations of (100), (110), (102), (103) at 2θ (33.3°, 59.8°, 50°, 66.5°) respectively, corresponding to the formation of polycrystalline AlN powder, which is in good agreement with the JCPDS diffraction file (JCPDS card no. 025-1133). The XRD graph of the pyrolysed precursor at 1000 °C and at 1 T under N2 atmosphere exhibits the characteristic peaks of (h-AlN) at (100), (110), (102), (103) at 2θ (33.3°, 59.8°, 50°, 66.5°) reflections, respectively, and at 2θ (45°) of c-AlN32 appeared more intense. Other peaks of carbon and AlON completely disappeared, which indicated the formation of pure AlN powder with high crystallinity. This is also in good agreement with the study of IR and TGA. We have also varied the inert gases by conducting the same experiments under an argon atmosphere instead of nitrogen to study the effect of inert gases. XRD spectra in Fig. 4(c) show that the precursor pyrolysed at 1000 °C, and 1 Torr pressure under the flow of argon atmosphere with a flow rate of 100 SCCM yields characterstic peaks of (h-AlN) and a small peak at 25° corresponding to carbon impurity. Hence, from the experiments it is observed that in a nitrogen atmosphere, clear decomposition takes place and also helps the formation of AlN. It is evident from the literature that at higher temperatures nitridation also takes place, which facilitates the formation of AlN.40 From the above experiment, it is also clear that in our case both amination and nitridation took place for the formation of AlN.

The XRD measurement of all powders reveals that the values of full width half maxima (FWHM) increase upon reducing pressure from 100 T to 1 T at 1000 °C and grain size decreases as shown in Fig. 5. The details are summarized in Table 2.

The average crystallite size of the powders were found to be in the range of ∼20 nm to 10 nm, which is calculated by the Debye–Scherrer formula shown below:  where D is the average particle size, K is a constant (0.89), λ = X-ray wavelength, β = full width half maxima (FWHM) and θ = Bragg's angle (in degree). At 900 °C and 1 T, a characteristic peak of AlN at 45° and 66.5° was observed. The FWHM value has been calculated at 66.5°. Hence, increasing the temperature and reducing the pressure promoted the quality of the grain size. Moreover, the FWHM of the peaks from the powder, which was treated with argon gas, is 0.67 degree and the grain size is 12.48 nm. The XRD spectra further explains the strain distribution in grains of the materials. Strain is an important factor for the grain size and its crystallinity. Fig. 6 shows the effect of strain in the grains at 1000 °C and at different pressures of selected peaks such as 2θ (33.3°, 59.8°, 66.5°). The strain was calculated by the Williamson–Hall method.41B = Kλ/D + 4εsinθwhere B is full width half maxima of the peak, K is the constant, D is the crystallite size, λ is the wavelength of the X-rays, θ is the diffraction angle and ε is the strain.

Herein, we have plotted the graph of powders between βcosθ/λ and sinθ/λ at various pressures and at 1000 °C.
Strain is calculated from the slope of the fitted line; this strain is generated by lattice cracking and dislocations due to thermal expansion. Fig. 6(f) illustrates that as the pressure reduces, the strain also decreases.42,43
3.4 Field emission scanning electron microscopy [FESEM]
The surface morphology of the AlN powder is shown in Fig. 7, produced at 1000 °C temperature, 1 Torr in N2 gas, showing the homogenous distribution of very fine AlN crystallites with sizes in the range of ∼10 nm, which is also confirmed by XRD. The surface morphology of powder shown in Fig. 7a and enlarge view of the surface is very smooth and homogeneous as shown in Fig. 7b. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) was also performed to study the elemental composition of the powder. The EDX spectrum [Fig. 7(c)] reveals the signals of Al, N, Au and Si where the presence of the Au peak is due to the Au coating and the presence of a very small amount of silicon may be due to the sample holder. EDX analysis shows the wt% compositions of the powder, 55.6 wt% for aluminum, 29.8 wt% for nitrogen, and 14.6 wt% for gold. The EDX analysis shows that the weight ratio of AlN is ∼2:1.

3.5 Mechanism and nucleation growth of formation of AlN
To understand the complete mechanism of the formation of AlN from the precursor, we have conducted ESI mass analysis of the precursor. The mechanism of growth of stable hexagonal AlN by aluminum urea chloride complex [Al(NH2CONH2)]6Cl3 was analyzed.15,39,44 The various moieties formed during the final formation of AlN are determined by mass spectrometry. Details of the mechanism and fragmentation pattern are given in Table 3. The mass spectra (see S1, ESI†) shows Al[NH2CONH2]6Cl3 Na+ has a molecular weight (m/z = ∼518) and can decompose into AlCl3 and NH2CONH2, as shown in eqn (1). The urea molecule converts into NH3, H2CNO and HCNO species, showing 80% weight loss at 350 °C. AlCl3 and NH2CONH formed AlCl3·NH2CONH2 (m/z = 194) (eqn (2)) exhibiting a high intensity peak with the removal of five moieties of urea. AlCl3 forms an [AlCl3·xNH3] adduct (m/z = 167) (eqn (4)) which becomes unstable under increasing temperatures and decomposes to form more stable (ClAlNH2)n species where n = 2, 4, 6 with 10% weight loss, at 500 °C. Further decomposition of (ClAlNH) formed c-AlN and h-AlN with the removal of HCl. Showing 8–10% char yield, we also observed the formation of (ClAlNH2)4 and (ClAlNH2)6 with cubic and hexagonal structure (eqn (7a) and (7b)), respectively based on the mass spectra. At higher temperatures, c-AlN is unstable and converts to h-AlN, which is also in good agreement with the XRD measurements.

3.6 Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) of AlN thin film
GIXRD of AlN thin film was obtained by pyrolysing coated precursor at 1 T and 1000 °C as shown in Fig. 8. From the GIXRD [in which incidence angle is fixed at 2° (grazing angle) and the detector is scanned along 2θ] results, it was found that XRD patterns of the film exhibited (103),45–47 (101), (002), and (400) orientations36,48 at a low pressure of 1 T and 1000 °C, which is in good agreement with JCPDS file no. 79-2497 corresponding to the formation of a polycrystalline hexagonal wurtzite structure of AlN thin film. The intensity of the (103) orientation was also found to be growing in tandem with the (002) peak intensity. The reason for this increase can be understood in the following way. In GIXRD geometry, the grazing incidence angle (γ) is kept small (∼2°) to enhance the X-ray intensity diffracted from the thin film. The diffraction angle (2θ) for (103) plane is ∼65.9° (θ = 32.95°). Thus for the (103) plane, the incident X-ray angle (θ–γ) is ∼30.95°, which is very close to the inter-planar angle (31.63°) between (002) and (103) planes and the incident X-ray angle of the (103) peak is twice the angle of the incident X-ray (θ–γ) ∼16° of (002) peak. Thus, the (103) peak intensity of the c-axis preferred oriented film is found to increase with the increase in the (002) peak intensity. The average crystallite size of the film is found to be in the range of ∼13 nm at (103) orientation, and the FWHM is found to be 0.0115 degree, which is calculated by the Debye–Scherrer formula as discussed above.

3.7 UV-Vis spectroscopy of AlN thin films
The UV-Visible spectrum of the complex is shown in Fig. 9. It was observed from the spectrum that the material absorbs most of the electromagnetic radiation in the deep UV region and is highly transparent in the entire visible region. The band gap of the as synthesized complex was found to be 4.3 eV. Furthermore, Fig. 10(a) shows the transmittance of AlN thin films obtained by pyrolysing at 1 T, 5 T and 10 T and 1000 °C, respectively. Fig. 10(b and c) show the band gap of thin films, based on the Tauc relation,43 which is between the absorption coefficient α and the incident photon energy E.αhν = A(hν − Eg)1/2where A is the material constant and Eg is the band gap energy.

 Fig. 10  Optical spectra of AlN thin films (a) transmittance spectra, (b and c) band gap of the pyrolysed thin films at 1000 °C and 5 T, 10 T and 1 T, respectively. 
On the basis of this relationship, Fig. 10(b) shows that AlN thin films grown at 10 Torr and 5 Torr were observed at 5.1 eV and 5.6 eV, respectively, while the band gap of AlN pyrolyzed at 1 Torr in Fig. 10(c) was observed at 6.2 eV, which is in good agreement with the bulk.49,50 It is evident from the FT-IR, TGA and XRD studies that the pyrolysis at 10 to 5 Torr leads to incomplete decomposition of the precursor due to the band gap blue shifting from the bulk whereas the thin film pyrolysed at 1 Torr shows the band gap at ∼6.2 eV. This result clearly shows that the temperature and pressure play crucial roles for the formation of AlN thin films from the precursor.51
3.8 XPS analysis of AlN thin film
The XPS survey scan of the AlN thin film is shown in Fig. 11. In this spectrum Al2p, N1s, C1s, and O1s peaks were analysed. The formation of AlN was confirmed by the Al2p and N1s spectra by XPS scans. The Al2p peak appeared at 74.37 eV, corresponding to Al–N,52–54 while the N1s scan showed peaks at 396.62 eV, attributed to the N–Al bond.55 The intense peak of O1s at 532 eV may be due to the O–Al bonding or atmospheric oxidation or from the substrate surface; this oxygen can react with the aluminum and form Al2O3.31 The carbon peak remained as an impurity or from some organic component during the deposition of film. The further optimization of AlN thin films are in progress in our laboratory.

3.9 Field emission electron microscopic studies (FESEM) of AlN thin films
Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy [FESEM] was performed to study the surface morphology and thickness of the pyrolysed thin films grown at 1000 °C on Si(100). Fig. 12(a) shows that the surface morphology of the film is smooth and homogeneous, and the inset shows the cross section image of the film with a thickness of about 700 nm. Fig. 12(b and c) show elemental mapping of Al and N and elemental analysis of the film, respectively, which shows the distribution of elements and the ratio of Al to N in the entire film. The FESEM images and electron mapping of thin films pyrolysed at 1000 °C and 5 T, 10 T pressures are shown in S2, ESI.†

4. Conclusions
We have successfully prepared AlN powder as well as thin films using hexa urea aluminate(III) single source precursor by CVD under nitrogen atmosphere. The complete conversion of the precursor to AlN was optimized by varying the temperature (800–1000 °C), pressure (10–1 T) and flow rate of inert gas (100–200 SCCM). The thin films were successfully prepared on the silicon and quartz substrates. The results exhibited that the optimal substrate temperature, pressure and flow rate were 1000 °C, 1 Torr and 100–200 SCCM, respectively. The optimal (103) oriented AlN films have the strongest XRD peak intensity, the smallest full width at half maxima (FWHM) value (0.0115°), and the largest grain size (13.8 nm). Finally, it was observed that the temperature, pressure and flow rates of inert gases play crucial roles for the complete conversion of the complex to AlN materials.
