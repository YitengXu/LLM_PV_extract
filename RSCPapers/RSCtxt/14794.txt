    AbstractIn this paper, we have discussed the most advanced state-of-the-art fourth-generation solar cells which consist mainly of 2D materials-based solar cells, Quantum dots-based solar cells (QDSCs), Perovskite solar cells (PSCs), Organic solar Cells (OSCs) and Dye-Sensitized solar Cells (DSSCs). 2D materials-based solar cells deploy MoS2, WS2 ,WSe2 and graphene in conjunction with other materials, owing to their exceptional electronic properties, such as fast electron mobility and high conductivity, hence giving rise to the development of several types of solar cells mainly DSSCs, organic, heterojunction, and perovskite solar cells. Quantum dots have also paved their way into solar cell technology as they can contribute to an increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE) because of their tendency to generate a number of excitons per incident photon. Owing to their quantum confinement effects, their optical properties are tunable according to the solar cell design requirements, thus they have their own designation as QDSCs in solar cell research area. PSCs are cheap, easy to fabricate and have been enticing interest in solar cell technology as they have offered high PCE in a short span of time because of the associated high carrier mobilities, excellent light absorption and band gap flexibility. In the same way, OSCs have emerged as alternatives which employ organic compounds possessing a wide band gap and having the capability to absorb photons of higher energy than those of conventional solar cells. Their major attributes are flexibility, compact designs and long-performance lifetime. DSSCs are a cost-effective green energy solution as the dye used in their fabrication offer effective optical absorption, offering high Fill Factor (FF) required for the effective working of solar cells. The researchers are exploiting the exceptional properties of all of these materials to explore new ventures in the solar cell research area, carrying on to heterojunction solar cells which are composed of multiple layers of these favourable materials. More advancement in the field of solar cell research is anticipated with the developments in the material sciences, ease of fabrication, device designs, and a deeper understanding of the physics underlying performance characteristics for solar cells.
