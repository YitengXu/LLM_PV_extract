    , Accepted 3rd April 2020First published on 6th April 2020AbstractIn this study, first-principles calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT) are exploited to investigate the electronic capabilities of SiC/InSe heterostructures. According to our results, the SiC/InSe heterostructure possesses an inherent type-II band alignment, which displays a noticeable Stark effect on the band gap under a stable electric field. Besides, the heterostructure exhibits a low carrier effective mass and a narrower band gap when it is subject to tensile strain. More interestingly, the transition from an indirect to a direct band gap occurs when 8% of compressive strain is applied. Taken together, findings in this study indicate that the SiC/InSe heterostructure opens up a new avenue for its application in the fields of optoelectronics and microelectronics.
1. Introduction
With the successful preparation of graphene,1 the two-dimensional (2D) atomically thin layered materials have received extensive attention from professional researchers due to their extraordinary optics, electrical phenomena and great applications as optoelectronic semiconductor materials.2–5 A series of layered materials have exhibited fascinating submission potential in next-generation semiconductors, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), which is ascribed to their magnificent optoelectronic properties.6–8 Recently, the design of heterostructures has been considered as a vigorous channel to form microscopic devices, and to stack 2D materials in the vertical direction by the weak coupling between layers, which opens up an additional avenue for the emergence of new materials and the generation of new devices.9–11 For instance, graphene/MoS2 has been successfully prepared experimentally, and it exhibits highly efficient electronic properties.12–14 Furthermore, Wang et al. successfully predicted the BX1–BX2 (X1, X2 = P, As, Sb) heterostructure and found that this structure possessed a broad absorption spectrum from ultraviolet to visible light, which stood for a promising material in the field of photovoltaics.15 Mao et al. designed a novel GeSe/SnSe bilayer heterostructure with a high optical response capability, thus turning a new page for the application of optoelectronic devices.16
In recent years, InSe, a new kind of two-dimensional layered semiconductor material, has been successfully synthesized via experiments by means of mechanical exfoliation, which has become an excellent material that arouses wide attention.17,18 As validated in previous reports, InSe possesses a low electron effective mass (m* = 0.143m0),19 a high electron mobility (approximate to black-P and higher than TMDs),20,21 and a broad absorption spectrum.22 Simultaneously, the InSe-based derivatives, including field-effect transistors, have illustrated fascinating optoelectronic characteristics with an extensive scope of semiconductors.23 Notably, its numerous glaring features make InSe an ideal material for future applications in optoelectronic devices.24,25
Bulk SiC single-crystal semiconductors have been widely utilized. Notably, 2D SiC has rapidly received increasing interest for its renowned traits,26 and its honeycomb structure which is similar to graphene,27 as it can be used under severe environments, such as high temperature, high power, and high frequency.28 The theoretical stability of isolated SiC has been validated.29,30 Lin et al. successfully prepared quasi-2D SiC using the reaction between graphene and silicon powder under the protection of an argon atmosphere.31 Furthermore, the black-P/g-SiC and GaN/SiC heterostructures have been successfully reported and predicted.32,33 The unique wide band gap of SiC matters a lot to its protrusion characteristic compared with other general individuals, and it has displayed broad application prospects in solar cells and light-emitting diodes.34 Moreover, it is likely that high quality optoelectronic and microelectronic devices can be obtained based on this structure in laboratories, as a result of extremely low lattice mismatch between the two single layers (SiC and InSe). In previous experimental reports, the MoS2/WS2 vdW heterojunction was prepared successfully by transferring monolayered MoS2 onto monolayered WS2 on sapphire.35 Chang et al. successfully prepared MoS2/graphene heterostructures by growing MoS2 on graphene.36 They will provide possible guidance for the preparation of SiC/InSe heterostructures in the future.
Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there are few first-principles studies on the SiC/InSe heterostructure. Therefore, this study aims to explore the nature of the interaction between the SiC nanosheet and the InSe monolayer. In addition, the electronic properties of this heterostructure, and its variations depending on the applied electric field and biaxial strain are also analyzed.
2. Computational methods
In our first-principles calculations, all works were carried out in the CASTEP code of the Materials Studio based on the density functional theory (DFT) with ultrasoft pseudopotential.37 In addition, the exchange–correlation potential was depicted by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) function associated with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA).38 The cutoff energy was set to 420 eV. In structural optimization, all atoms in the supercell were fully relaxed, and the energy and maximum force between atoms were converged to the capacities of 1.0 × 10−5 eV and 0.03 eV Å−1, respectively. A 5 × 5 × 1 k-points grid determined by the Monkhorst–Pack model was selected to reasonably sample the Brillouin zone. Furthermore, to avoid the interaction between periodic boundaries, the vacuum thickness along the Z-axis was set to 20 Å. The DFT-D method of Grimme was used to redress the effect of van der Waals interactions on account of the weak interlayer coupling.39 Moreover, the HSE06 hybrid function was implemented to check the issues caused by the PBE method, since the band gap value of the semiconductor was usually underestimated by GGA-PBE approximation.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural features of the SiC/InSe heterostructure
To construct the SiC/InSe heterostructure well, the structural characteristics of the SiC and InSe monolayers are calculated first. After geometric optimization, the calculated lattice constant of SiC is a = b = 3.09 Å, while that of InSe is a = b = 4.07 Å, and both of them provide hexagonal lattices, thus agreeing well with the current theoretical and experimental results.40,41 According to a previous work, it is rewarding to form the heterostructure at the lattice mismatch of less than 5%.42 To achieve a good match between the lattices of two materials, a supercell of SiC and a 2 × 2 × 1 supercell of InSe are constructed to form a SiC/InSe bilayer, and a lattice mismatch of 0.37% is obtained. Furthermore, the divergence in the relative position of an isolated layer tends to beget structural changes.43 Therefore, to examine the effect of stacking pattern on the SiC/InSe heterostructure (Fig. 1), we have fully considered three possible configurations which are labeled as S1, S2, and S3, respectively. Among them, S1 is the original stacking pattern among the three stacking configurations, and all of them rely on the slip for mutual conversion.
 Fig. 1  (a)–(c) are structural views of S1, S2 and S3, respectively. The upper layer represents a top view, and the lower layer shows a side view, where d indicates the interlayer distance. Among them, cyan, yellow, orange, and blue correspond to C, Si, Se, and In atoms, respectively. 

Table 1 shows quite a few crucial parameters regarding these several stacking feasible configurations. Clearly, the bond lengths of Si–C, In–Se, and In–In are not substantially altered in these three different configurations, which implies that there is little or no rearrangement between atoms. Accordingly, the optimized structure only undergoes such minor modifications that they still have completely similar characteristics.

To effectively evaluate the relative stability of the SiC/InSe heterostructures, the binding energy (Eb) is estimated according to the following formula: (1)where ESiC/InSe, ESiC, and EInSe correspond to the overall energies of the SiC/InSe heterostructure, the isolated SiC layer, and the InSe nanosheet, respectively; and A is the interface area. The negative Eb value indicates that these patterns are energetically feasible and can be obtained easily, and a smaller value stands for a higher stability. In contrast, a positive value corresponds to structural turbulence. It is obvious after analyzing the above configuration data of S1, S2, and S3 that they have the same Eb of −12.72 meV Å−2, indicating that they are all stable and that the stacking effect has little essential influence on the interaction between the SiC and InSe nanosheets. Typically, these results essentially imply that their interactions are not strong due to the large interlayer spacing. Furthermore, the electronic properties of these three different stacking configurations are explored (Fig. S1, ESI†). S1 has an identical electronic energy band structure and a large band gap; as a result, the S1 stacking is selected as the basis for tunable Eb and other theoretical properties.
It is widely known that, varying the interlayer distance (d) is a pivotal method to tune the electronic features of the heterostructure. According to a previous report, the atomically thin InSe is an extremely strain-sensitive material;44 correspondingly, the position of the InSe sheet is fixed and the interlayer distance is regulated by transforming the relative position of another single layer, so as to avoid interference from several other external factors. The ideal result is obtained from Fig. 2(a); in other words, the lowest Eb of −14.81 meV Å−2 is acquired at d = 3.34 Å (d1), which corresponds to the most stable heterostructure and the band gap value of 0.64 eV. Furthermore, such a result is close to the InSe/MoS2 heterostructure with the same order of magnitude of 18.90 meV Å−2, and similar to the graphite crystal measured in the experiment,45,46 both of which belong to the typical vdW force calculated according to the DFT (about 13–21 meV Å−2).47 Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows that the absence of a negative region in the phonon essentially demonstrates the stable SiC/InSe heterostructure. It should be noted that the band gap of the SiC/InSe heterostructure decreases linearly with the increase in interlayer distance from d1, which is originated from the inverse correlation of interlayer distance with interlayer interaction. Conversely, as the interlayer distance reduces from d1 to 2.54 Å, the band gap first increases to d = 2.74 Å, and then declines, which is attributed to the strong interlayer coupling. Meanwhile, Eb becomes positive when d is less than 2.54 Å, suggesting that the structure is chaotic.

3.2 Electronic performance of the SiC/InSe heterostructure
To better examine the electronic characteristics of the SiC/InSe heterostructure, the calculations are first carried out on the SiC and InSe nanosheets, respectively. The profiles of electronic structures are presented in Fig. 3(a) and (b), respectively. As observed from the figure, the pure SiC monolayer displays a direct band gap of 2.58 eV at the high-symmetric K point. In the meantime, the freestanding InSe owns an indirect band gap of 1.46 eV, where the VBM is within the Γ–K point route, whereas the CBM falls at the high-symmetric K point. These results are confirmed by the predecessors.48–51 After constructing the heterostructure, the properties of SiC and InSe monolayers are well preserved, as manifested in Fig. 3(c). For the SiC/InSe heterostructure, the indirect band gap is characterized by the differences in VBM (K point) and CBM (Γ point) locations. Clearly, the SiC/InSe heterostructure shares a much narrower band gap (0.64 eV) than these isolated individuals, which is mainly due to the result (type-II heterostructure) obtained from these individuals during the contact process. Such observations illustrate that electrons are more susceptible to excitation from VBM to CBM, when the heterostructure is bathed in light. Moreover, to further argue the sources of VBM and CBM, their orbital diagrams are described in Fig. 3(d). It is seen that the local charge density of the Highest-Occupied-Molecular-Orbital (HOMO) is mainly sited in the SiC layer, whereas that of the Lowest-Unoccupied-Molecular-Orbital (LUMO) is almost concentrated in the InSe single layer. The total density of states of the SiC/InSe heterostructure, together with its constituents, is plotted in Fig. 3(e) to ensure the validity of the results. According to our findings, the SiC layer acts as the sole VBM investor, while CBM is mainly taken over by InSe individuals in the SiC/InSe heterostructure. Given the above calculations and the corresponding theoretical analysis results, the HSE06 hybrid function is utilized to fill in some possible defects. The corrected effects demonstrate that the isolated SiC and the InSe nanosheets, along with the SiC/InSe heterostructure, show certain amplitude enlargements for the band gap, which correspond to 3.51 eV, 2.79 eV and 1.75 eV (Fig. S3, ESI†), respectively. These results are well matched with the previous calculations.52,53 As a result, although the PBE method can not appraise the band gap heterogeneity of a semiconductor without any flaws, it still predicts the available trends and physical mechanisms of band gap variation. Consequently, it is meaningful to use this approach to project the outcome.

(d) Distribution of charge density in the SiC/InSe heterostructure. (e) Total density of states of the isolated SiC, InSe monolayers, and the SiC/InSe heterostructure. (f) Band alignment of the SiC, InSe single layers, and the SiC/InSe heterostructure, with the vacuum level being used as a reference. 
In addition, the work function, a linchpin parameter that evaluates the internal charge behaviors of a system, is utilized as a reference to explain the relevant electrical phenomena. Our results show that the work function is equal to 4.84 eV for the SiC monolayer and 5.88 eV for the InSe nanosheet, which is consistent with the previous first-principles results.54,55 Electrons spontaneously diffuse from the SiC to the InSe layer when they are in close contact, which is attributable to the relatively higher Fermi level of the former rather than the latter. Meanwhile, the Fermi level of SiC (InSe) gradually moves downward (upward) with the further increase in the number of electron transfers and eventually reaches the same level in the system, which is responsible for the work function value of 5.12 eV in the SiC/InSe heterostructure. Similar behaviors are also observed in Fig. 2(b), which are attributed to the more profound potential energy of SiC than InSe. Hence, the positive charges are accumulated in the SiC layer, whereas the negative charges are accumulated in the InSe layer, accordingly forming a built-in electric field (Eint) from SiC to InSe. The internal charge drift of the heterostructure is violently stimulated by Eint and finally reaches a balance with the diffusion force.
To gain more insight into the heterostructure, the band alignments of two isolated layers and nanocomposites are described relative to the vacuum level, as shown in Fig. 3(f). As obtained from the figure, the VBM and CBM of two monolayers in the heterostructure follow the order of VBMInSe < VBMSiC < CBMInSe < CBMSiC, thus forming an intrinsic type-II band alignment. In addition, the features of electrons and holes are effectively separated at the interface, making this heterostructure an ideal material for electron–hole separators.56,57 More specifically, the band offset, which plays an indispensable role in the system for optoelectronic device applications, is also calculated. Among them, the SiC/InSe heterostructure holds a valence band offset (VBO) of about 0.72 eV and a conduction band offset (CBO) of about 1.94 eV. Subsequently, photogenerated electrons shift from the CB of SiC to InSe, which gives rise to CBO, while the holes move from the VB of InSe to SiC under the assistance of VBO. Finally, the photogenerated electron–hole pairs with the lowest energy in the space are sufficiently dispersed, and the energy conversion efficiency is also enhanced with regard to type-II band alignment. The HSE06 band alignment is plotted in Fig. S4 (ESI†) to more accurately display the relative change in band alignment. As shown in the figure, the SiC/InSe heterostructure maintains the inherent type-II band alignment, which is consistent with the former. Such findings suggest that the SiC/InSe heterostructure may serve as a promising novel and distinguished material in the field of photovoltaic devices, such as solar cells.
3.3 Effect of an external electric field on the SiC/InSe heterostructure
In the experiment, the application of an external electric field (Eext) is familiarly recognized to be an effective means of regulating the electronic capabilities of heterostructures, which can be applied to nanoelectronic devices. To probe the relationship between the electronic features of the heterostructure and Eext, a sufficient number of diverse Eext are used to regulate the electronic behavior of the system. Typically, the forward direction of Eext is determined by the transition from the InSe layer (bottom) to the SiC layer (upper), and it is orthogonal to the two constituent monolayers. The curve of band gaps with Eext is summarized in Fig. 4(a), which suggests that the band gaps of the heterostructure differ a lot under different Eext.
 Fig. 4  (a) Variation in the band gap with respect to the external electric field (the inset represents the orientation of the positive electric field applied to the heterostructure). (b) Average charge density difference within the heterostructure is along the Z-axis direction (the insert in the figure corresponds to the 3D isosurface to describe the electron density difference inside the heterostructure, where the accumulation and depletion of electrons are expressed as blue and green, respectively, and the isosurface of 0.0015 e Å−3). 

Fig. 5(a) and (b) present the projected energy band structures and the total density of states of the SiC/InSe heterostructure at E = 0.4 and −0.4 V Å−1, respectively. As observed from this figure, the SiC layer denotes the VBM of the SiC/InSe heterostructure, whereas the CBM is derived from the InSe layer, and the variation of Eext only has a minimal effect on this status. Such results indicate that the SiC/InSe heterostructure maintains the inherent type-II band alignment under a suitable Eext. To more clearly analyze the mutation of the band gap with Eext, the flow of carriers in the heterostructure is dissected in detail. When a forward Eext opposite to the Eint direction is imposed, the band gap decreases monotonously with the enhancement in Eext. As clearly visualized from Fig. 5(c), the electron (hole) progress gradually moves from SiC (InSe) to InSe (SiC), which weakens the influence of Eint. Subsequently, the quasi-Fermi level of SiC (InSe) begins to rise (decline), and the relative separation of the quasi-Fermi level brings about a narrower band gap and a wider band offset. Moreover, the larger band offset enhances the effects of separation and collection of photogenerated charges when the heterostructure is irradiated with light. Notably, the nature of the more efficient photogenerated carrier separation under a positive electric field makes the heterostructure applicable for optoelectronic devices. Further increase in Eext leads to a linearly evolving and monotonically decreasing band gap until E = 0.52 V Å−1, eventually leading to a metallic transition.

On the contrary, the effect of Eint is heightened since its direction is coincident with that of Eext under a negative Eext, resulting in a difference in the band gap development. In the region of −0.46 V Å−1 < E < 0, the band gap is positively correlated with Eext, and the band gap extends as the electric field increases. Its charge flow is illustrated in Fig. 5(e), where the direction of charge transfer is opposite to that of the positive electric field, and the quasi-Fermi level of InSe moves upward, whereas that of SiC moves downward. Thus, the band gap of the heterostructure grows, and the band offset subsides, which is attributed to the splitting of the VB and CB of the SiC/InSe heterostructure under Eext, as referred to as the giant Stark effect (GSE). At E = −0.46 V Å−1, the maximum band gap of 1.23 eV is observed. In particular, the band gap declines rapidly as the Eext elevates in the range of −0.6 V Å−1 < E < −0.46 V Å−1. After E > −0.6 V Å−1, the band gap is closed suddenly, and a semiconductor–metal (SM) state transition occurs, which results from the dielectric breakdown and charge tunneling.
Furthermore, difference in the average charge density of the SiC/InSe bilayer along the Z-axis direction is dissected to more comprehensively illustrate the charge transfer, as described below: (2)where ρT(x,y,z)dxdy, ρSiC(x,y,z)dxdy, and ρInSe(x,y,z)dxdy are the charge densities of the SiC/InSe bilayer, SiC, and InSe monolayers at the (x,y,z) point, respectively. In this calculation, a positive value in the formula denotes charge accumulation, whereas a negative value represents charge depletion. Fig. 4(b) manifests the difference in average charge density in the absence of Eext. It is seen from the inset that electrons flow from the SiC to the InSe layer across the interface, while holes are stuck on the SiC side, which are consistent with the results of average electrostatic potential. Moreover, Fig. 6 exhibits the charge densities of the SiC/InSe heterostructure under different Eext. When a positive Eext is applied, the electrons supplied by the SiC layer flow to the InSe layer, leading to n-doping in InSe and p-doping in SiC. Conversely, the charge exhibits a reverse shift when a negative Eext is applied. Undoubtedly, an increasing number of charges that move in the SiC/InSe system occur with an increase in Eext values, which denotes a stronger interlayer interaction and results in a band edge shift, ultimately giving rise to dielectric breakdown. Similar phenomena are also observed in the black-P/MoS2, blue-P/black-P heterostructures, and the like.58,59 These results reveal that both the electronic band structure and the SM transition of the SiC/InSe heterostructure depend on electrostatic gating, which offer a novel and feasible design direction for the development of semiconductor devices (like MEMS devices).

3.4 Effect of biaxial strain on the electronic characteristics of SiC/InSe heterostructures
It is universally acknowledged that the mechanical strain approach also plays an essential role in regulating the electronic traits of heterostructures, and this method has attracted widespread interests in nanodevices.60 Therefore, the effect of biaxial strain, which is mimicked by adjusting the lattice constants along the X- and Y-directions simultaneously, on the electronic properties of SiC/InSe heterostructures is explored in this study. The degree of strain (ε) is stipulated as: (3)where L and L0 correspond to the structural lattice constants without and after strain, respectively. A positive value stands for tensile strain (ε > 0), whereas a negative one represents compressive strain (ε < 0).
Herein, to explore the influence of biaxial strain on the heterostructure, variations in the SiC/InSe heterostructure properties are investigated to be from −8% to 7%. Based on our calculation results, the geometry in this strain region is successfully optimized. Above all, the strain energy (Es) under strain stress is discussed before analyzing the electronic features of the system. The magnitude of Es conveys the effect of strain on the structure, which is calculated as follows, ES = ET(ε) − ET(ε = 0)(4)where ET(ε) and ET(ε = 0) represent the total energies at biaxial strain and at equilibrium, respectively. Fig. 7(a) illustrates the connection between the Es of the heterostructure and the grading of the strain. It is noted from the figure that Es increases with increasing strain when the tensile or compressive strain is controlled within a suitable range. It is worth noting that Es changes harmoniously as a quadratic function of the strain, which indicates that the SiC/InSe system is flexible in this case. Thus, it is certain that all the strains studied are within the elastic limit and are fully feasible.61

(c) and (d) Projected band structures of SiC/InSe heterostructures under a degree of strain of 7%, −8%, respectively. (e) Effect of biaxial strains on the effective mass of the carrier. 
Afterwards, based on the above description, the curve regarding the band gap under the strain of the SiC/InSe heterostructure is roughly expressed in Fig. 7(b), in which the band gap exhibits an approximately linear variation with stress. As observed from the curve, within the range of 0 < ε < 6%, the band gap is reduced as the tension reinforces, which is ascribed to the increasing amount of charges passing through the interface between SiC and the InSe layers, and the indirect band gap is maintained. In general, the electrons of a semiconductor with a smaller band gap are less obstructed by the electron transition from the VB to CB, and such a characteristic is of extraordinary significance in the application of electronic devices. Noteworthily, the zero band gap is fabricated with the further increase in strain, and the semiconductor–metal state transition is observed when ε > 6%. Fig. 7(c) outlines the projected energy band diagram at ε = 7%. As observed from the figure, the band gap expands linearly with the increase in strain degree when a compressive strain is applied. Subsequently, the indirect band gap is converted to the direct one under the strain of about 8%, as shown in Fig. 7(d). This transition is ascribed to the energy fluctuations at different locations along the strip edge under strain. Furthermore, the direct band gap shows lower phonon energy than the indirect one for electronic excitation. Accordingly, its characteristics with the direct band gap of 1.54 eV make it suitable for optoelectronic applications.
At the same time, it should be noted that the irreducible Brillouin zone of the heterostructure remains constant under different strains, since its original hexagonal symmetry is well preserved. To further understand the impact of strain on the electrical behavior of the heterostructure, the effective mass of carriers is also investigated to describe the effect of biaxial strain on the heterostructure with regard to the carrier mobility. Generally, a smaller effective mass stands for a higher carrier mobility when there are no other external factors. Moreover, the second derivative value of the curve regarding the conduction band bottom (valence band top) in the projected energy band is used to assess the effective mass of the electron (hole) in the heterostructure, and the formula is expressed as follows, (5)Using the above method, the effective mass of the electron (hole) in SiC is calculated to be 0.54m0 (0.27m0), while that in InSe is determined to be 0.11m0 (1.1m0), where m0 stands for the mass of free-electron. Furthermore, we depict the variation curve of the effective mass of charge in the SiC/InSe heterostructure under strain as shown in Fig. 7(e). Upon calculation, the effective mass of the electron (hole) in the heterostructure is 0.11m0 (0.23m0), which is lower than or equal to those of the SiC and InSe monolayers in the absence of strain, implying that the SiC/InSe heterostructure possesses a higher carrier mobility than these two single layers. Clearly, there is little change in the effective mass of electrons (holes) under tensile strain, indicating that the heterostructure is steady and maintains a high carrier mobility under great tensile stress. However, when the compressive stress is applied, the effective mass of electrons (holes) remains stable only within the strain range of 3%, and the mobility is relatively reduced as the effective mass of the carrier increased with the further growth of strain. In addition, when the compressive strain is added to 8%, the curve of effective mass suddenly jumps, and that of the hole becomes large, whereas that of the electron declines, which is attributable to the formation of a direct band gap. At this moment, the effective mass of the electron is much smaller than that of the hole, implying that electrons dominate the conductivity of the heterostructure. These results indicate that the carrier mobility of the heterostructure has a non-negligible change under compressive strain. Our results support that biaxial strain energy can be regarded as a feasible means to effectively regulate the band gap and carrier mobility in the heterostructure. In other words, biaxial strain energy can be used as an efficient approach to prepare high-performance flexible electronic devices.
4. Conclusions
To sum up, first-principles calculations are utilized in this study to theoretically explore the structural and electronic capabilities of SiC/InSe heterostructures, and their electronic properties are modulated using Eext and biaxial strain, respectively. Based on the findings in this study, the SiC/InSe heterostructure with an inherent type II band alignment is obtained by combining the isolated SiC and InSe nanolayers. In particular, the perfect separation of photogenerated charges reveals that the SiC/InSe heterostructure can serve as a promising candidate for solar cells. More importantly, the band gap displays a linear correlation with the suitable Eext, and it is closed at a larger Eext. Simultaneously, the transition from the indirect to the direct band gap is complied at 8% compressive stress, which makes it suitable for applications in optoelectronic devices. Moreover, the heterostructure maintains a low carrier effective mass under tensile stress, and its band gap decreases as the strain increases, eventually achieving a metallic transition at ε = 7%. This work demonstrates that the flexible SiC/InSe heterostructure possesses extremely remarkable electronic properties, which can be potentially applied in optoelectronic and microelectronic devices.
