    , Accepted 10th October 2017First published on 11th October 2017AbstractStrong electron-withdrawing materials of bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide (TFSA, [CF3SO2]2NH) and bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI, [CF3SO2]2NLi) are incorporated into the active layers of a porphyrin small molecule TDPPEZnP and PC61BM for bulk heterojunction solar cells. While the solar cells based on the undoped devices show a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.11% with a Voc of 0.70 V, a Jsc of 13.92 mA cm−2 and a FF of 62.71%, doping the active layers with very low loadings of LITFSI and TFSA leads to improved PCEs of 6.85% and 7.01% with Jsc values of 14.97 and 15.39 mA cm−2 and FF values of 64.73% and 63.92%, accounting for 14% and 16% PCE enhancement, respectively. The improved performance is ascribed to the enhanced charge carrier transport, which is supported by charge mobility, impedance spectroscopy and transient spectroscopy analyses.
1. Introduction
Due to the advantages of achieving lightweight, flexible and low-cost devices,1–5 tremendous efforts have been made to improve the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs). Through material design, interface engineering6–9 and the optimizations of the film morphology,10–12 PCEs over 10% have been achieved recently.13–16
Efficient charge transfer and transport play important roles in high performing solar cells. By designing conjugated electron donor–acceptor (D–A) porphyrin structures to facilitate the intramolecular charge transfer and tuning the morphology by solvent additives and post-treatments to enhance the charge transport, many efficient porphyrin-based OSCs have been reported with PCEs of up to 9%.17–22 Also, the incorporation of porphyrin donors into binary solar cells led to further performance enhancement with PCEs of up to 11% for the ternary OSCs since the conjugated D–A porphyrins can broaden light absorption to the near infrared region to provide more charges to be collected by the electrodes.13,23,24 On the other hand, doping the active layers has also been proved to be effective to enhance the charge transport in OSCs25–29 by tunneling contacts and generating space charge layers in p–n junctions.30,31 For example, lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)-amide (LiTFSI, [CF3SO2]2NLi) is relatively widely-used not only in perovskite solar cells as an interface dopant32 but also in BHJ OSCs as an electron interlayer,33 and bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)-amide (TFSA, [CF3SO2]2NH) can replace poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)34 or be used as an additive in active layers to improve the performance of BHJ OSCs.35
In this contribution, we investigate the effects of TFSA and LITFSI dopants on the solution-processed BHJ OSCs based on a porphyrin small molecule TDPPEZnP donor and PC61BM acceptor (TDPPEZnP: 5,15-bis(3-([2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)-2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-6-(thiophen-2-yl)-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione-5′-yl-ethynyl)-10,20-bis(5-(2-butyloctyl)benzo[b]thiophen-2-yl)-porphyrin zinc(II), PC61BM: [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester). While the un-doped devices show a PCE of 6.11% with a Jsc of 13.92 mA cm−2 and a FF of 62.71%, the doped devices containing 5 × 10−4% LITFSI and 5 × 10−3% TFSA exhibit enhanced PCEs of 6.85% and 7.01% with the unchanged Voc but improved Jsc values of 14.97 and 15.07 mA cm−2 and FF values of 64.73% and 63.92%, respectively.
2. Experimental
Chemicals
LITFSI and TFSA were purchased from Sigma and ACROS, respectively. The chemical structures of TDPPEZnP, LITFSI and TFSA are shown in Fig. 1. As described in the ESI,† the two precursors 3,6-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione and 5,15-diethynyl-10,20-bis(5-(2-butyloctyl)benzo[b]thiophen-2-yl)porphyrin zinc(II) were synthesized according to the reported procedures.36,37 And the final target compound TDPPEZnP was obtained in 40% yield using the Sonogashira coupling reaction of the two precursors.

Device fabrication
After indium-tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates were cleaned prior to device fabrication by sonication in acetone, detergent, distilled water, and then isopropyl alcohol, and treated with an oxygen plasma for 3 minutes, a 40 nm PEDOT:PSS (Bayer Baytron 4083) layer was spin-cast on the ITO-coated glass substrates at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The substrates were subsequently dried at 150 °C for 10 min in air and then transferred to a N2-glovebox. TDPPEZnP and PC61BM at a ratio of 1:1 (w/w) were dissolved in chlorobenzene to generate a 24 mg ml−1 blend solution in the presence of a 0.4% (v/v) pyridine additive, and then stirred at 70 °C overnight. The active layers were then spin-cast at 1500 rpm for 50 s on the PEDOT:PSS-coated substrates in a N2-filled glove box followed by thermal annealing at 135 °C for 10 min. After cooling down, the active layers were treated by solvent vapor annealing (SVA) in a chloroform atmosphere in a petri dish for 60 s. For the active layers containing LITFSI or TFSA, nitromethane solution was added in the blend solution before it was spin-coated. All active layers showed a similar film thickness of ∼100 nm, as determined using a profilometer. Then, an ultra-thin poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene (PFN))] layer was deposited by spin-casting from a 0.02% (w/v) methanol solution (from 2000 rpm for 30 s). Finally, Al (∼80 nm) was evaporated with a shadow mask as the top electrode. The effective area was measured to be 0.058 cm2.
Characterization and instruments
The PCEs were determined from the J–V characteristics measured using a Keithley 2400 source-measurement unit under an AM 1.5G spectrum from a solar simulator (Oriel model 91192) at 100 mW cm−2. Solar simulator illumination intensity was determined using a monocrystal silicon reference cell (Hamamatsu S1133, with KG-5 visible color filter) calibrated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements of the blends' surface morphology were conducted on a NanoScope NS3A system (Digital Instrument). External quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the encapsulated devices were measured using an integrated system (Enlitech, Taiwan, China) and a lock-in amplifier with a current preamplifier under short-circuit conditions. The devices were illuminated by monochromatic light from a 75 W xenon lamp. The light intensity was determined using a calibrated silicon photodiode. The transient photocurrents (TPCs) of the devices were measured at zero external bias (Jsc condition) by applying 580 nm laser pulses with a pulse width of 120 fs and a low pulse energy to the short circuited devices in the dark. The laser pulses were generated from an optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS-Prime) pumped by a mode-locked Ti:sapphire oscillator seeded regenerative amplifier with a pulse energy of 1.3 mJ at 800 nm and a repetition rate of 1 kHz (SpectraPhysics Spitfire Ace). The photocurrent produced a transient voltage signal on a 50 Ω resistor, which was recorded using an oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS 3052C). Transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements were performed using a similar setup to that used for the TPC measurements.
3. Results and discussion
Photovoltaic performance
As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 2a, while the un-doped devices based on TDPPEZnP:PC61BM show a PCE of 6.11% with a Voc of 0.70 V, a Jsc of 13.92 mA cm−2 and a FF of 62.71%, the addition of 2 × 10−3% TFSA (w.t.) slightly increases the PCE to 6.31%. Further TFSA loading of 5 × 10−3% simultaneously improved the Jsc and FF values to 15.39 mA cm−2 and a FF of 63.92%, respectively, with an unchanged Voc, leading to an enhanced PCE of 7.01%. However, more TFSA loading reduces all the photovoltaic parameters, and the PCE is only 1.32% when TFSA loading is 0.5%. On the other hand, the devices doped with LITFSI show a similar tendency but are more sensitive to its loadings. And the best PCE of 6.85% was recorded with a LITFSI loading of only 5 × 10−4% also with an unchanged Voc of 0.70 V but simultaneously improved Jsc and FF values 14.97 mA cm−2 and 64.73%, respectively.

The enhanced photocurrents of devices by the addition of LITFSI and TFSA are confirmed using the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra. From the EQE spectra shown in Fig. 2b, the Jsc values of the control and doped devices with LITFSI and TFSA are calculated to be 12.43, 12.88 and 13.06 mA cm−2, respectively. It is seen that the doped devices exhibit slightly improved EQE values in a wide wavelength range from 450 to 850 nm, which can be ascribed to the enhanced charge transport induced by the strong electron-withdrawing LITFSI and TFSA, which are supported by charge mobility, impedance spectroscopy and transient spectroscopy analyses below.
Absorption spectroscopy and the surface morphology
The absorption spectra of the BHJ blends with and without the two additives were measured to investigate whether the dopants change the light harvest properties of the BHJ films. As seen in Fig. S6 (ESI†), while the absorption spectrum with 5 × 10−4% LITFSI changes slightly, that with 5 × 10−3% TFSA almost overlaps with that of the TDPPEZnP pure film, suggesting that the enhanced performance of LITFSI- and TFSA-doped devices cannot be ascribed to the absorption changes. Furthermore, the onsets of the three absorption spectra are the same, indicating that the two additives do not change the optical bandgap of TDPPEZnP at such low loadings.
The surface morphology of the control and doped blend films with PC61BM is characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM).38–42 As seen in Fig. S7 (ESI†), the three films show a quite similar surface morphology with root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of 0.861, 0.877 and 0.917 nm for the un-doped, and doped with 5 × 10−4% LITFSI and 5 × 10−3% TFSA films, respectively, indicating that the very low loadings of the two additives also do not lead to remarkable surface morphology changes.
Charge mobility
In order to further investigate the charge transport properties of the devices, electron-only and hole-only devices were fabricated with the device structures of ITO/ZnO/active layer/PFN/Al and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/WO3/Al, respectively. Charge carrier mobilities were estimated using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method.43 As shown in Table 2 and Fig. S9, S10 (ESI†), the doped devices containing 5 × 10−4% LITFSI and 5 × 10−3% TFSA exhibit hole mobilities (μh) of 5.63 × 10−4 and 5.67 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1, respectively, while the undoped ones show a smaller hole mobility of 3.35 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1. On the other hand, the electron mobilities (μe) are also improved to 4.04 × 10−4 and 4.25 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1 for LITFSI and TFSA doped devices, respectively, compared with an electron mobility of 1.82 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1 for the control devices. Larger hole and electron mobilities of the doped devices can be ascribed to the enhanced charge transport in the doped devices, leading to the higher Jsc and FF values for the doped solar cells.23 Higher carrier mobilities also indicate that dissociation of bound hole-electron pairs and charge extraction are more efficient,44 which are supported by the transient spectroscopy disused below. It is also noted that the μh/μe ratios of the doped devices are closer to 1 than that of the control devices, indicating the more balanced charge transport in the doped devices, which is also beneficial for the improvement of Jsc and FF.45

Impedance spectroscopy analysis
We employed impedance spectroscopy to measure the series resistances (Rs) of the control and doped OSCs. Fig. 3a shows the Nyquist plots of the impedance spectra measured in the dark with an alternating current signal under an external bias of the open-circuit voltage in a frequency range from10 Hz to 5 MHz. The Rs of an OSC is composed of the sheet resistance (Rsheet) and the charge transfer resistance (RCT). Since Rsheet is related to electrodes and RCT is correlated with the interfaces between the electrodes and the charge extraction layers, the charge extraction layers and the active layer, and the active layer itself,46 the series resistance (Rs) differences of the control and doped OSCs are only in RCT values induced by the undoped and doped BHJ layers, and the RCT values are calculated to be 602.2, 550.5 and 507.6 Ω for the undoped, doped with LITFSI and TFSA, respectively, from the impedance spectra shown in Fig. 3a. It is generally accepted that an effective doping can decrease the injection barrier, leading to a lower series resistance, which can reduce the current losses across the active layers and improve the Jsc value of an OSC.47

Transient spectroscopy analysis
Transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) methods were employed to investigate the doping effects of LITFSI and TFSA on the charge transport kinetics of the OSCs.48 As shown in Fig. 3b, compared to the control devices, both the doped ones show a more rapid TPV decay rate, indicating more efficient charge carrier extraction in the doped devices.49 On the other hand, the TPC decay curves of the doped devices (Fig. 3c) display higher photocurrent than the undoped ones, and the normalized TPC curves of the devices doped at the optimal and higher concentrations (∼0.1% of donor) are almost overlapped (Fig. S11, ESI†). These results suggest the increased number of mobile carriers as a result of dopant-assisted charge dissociation.50 Furthermore, from the normalized TPC curves shown in Fig. 3d, it is seen that the doped devices show a slightly faster current decay than the control devices, which can also be ascribed to the improved charge transport in the doped devices.51
4. Conclusions
In summary, by doping the active layers based on a porphyrin small molecule TDPPEZnP with strong electron-withdrawing molecules LITFSI and TFSA, the PCEs of the OSCs are enhanced to 6.85% and 7.01%, which are increased by 14% and 16%, respectively, compared to the undoped devices. The improved performance is ascribed to the enhanced charge carrier transport, which is supported by charge mobility, impedance spectroscopy and transient spectroscopy analyses. Our findings suggest that introducing strong electron-withdrawing molecules into porphyrin small molecule-based OSCs is a facile method to improve their performance.
