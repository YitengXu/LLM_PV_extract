    , Accepted 18th March 2022First published on 18th March 2022AbstractOxide ferroelectric materials based on the ABO3 structure possess net electric polarization at zero applied fields that give rise to new photovoltaic concepts. One of the peculiar properties specific to ferroelectric materials is the ‘anomalous photovoltaic effect’ (APVE), where the photovoltage of the single junction device exceeds the bandgap. Like many next-generation photovoltaic concepts, namely hot-electron harvesting, multi-exciton generation, and up- or down-conversion, the ferroelectric photovoltaics can lead to a phenomenal revolution in the solar cell domain. Although APVE is observed in oxides, these materials possess a large optical bandgap and low charge carrier diffusion length, limiting their ability for further exploration in high performance solar cells. Recently, a new class of organic–inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP) materials with exceptional structural tunability and extraordinary optoelectronic properties has emerged. These materials were successfully employed in solar cells, and have shown excellent power conversion efficiency of over 25%. A sub-class of OIHPs based on a two-dimensional layered structure was shown to possess a non-centrosymmetric structure with net ferroelectric polarization. These materials provide a new opportunity to explore the anomalous photovoltaic effect and potentially improve the conversion efficiency. There are at least 28 different layered halide perovskites with 23 unique organic cations reported to possess above-room-temperature ferroelectrics. In this review, we have analyzed all of these systems and presented three different design strategies to introduce polarization in the perovskite crystal structure: (i) alloying of organic cations that possess a net dipole, (ii) halogen substitution in organic linkers, and (iii) the use of homochiral polar molecules. In the second half of this review, we discuss the application space made possible by these ferroelectric semiconductors, namely photodetectors, solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and piezoelectric detectors. We conclude this review with a roadmap for employing these 2D-layered halide perovskite ferroelectric materials for highly efficient optoelectronic devices, specifically solar cells.Puneet SiwachPuneet Siwach received his B Tech. in Chemical Engineering in 2014 from the Deenbandhu Chhotu Ram University of Science and Technology, Sonepat, India.

1. Introduction
Semiconductor materials with net electric polarization or ferroelectric properties have potential to be the next-generation materials for photovoltaics (PV). In general, the ferroelectric materials possess built-in asymmetry caused by the lack of inversion.1–3 This asymmetry creates local polarization and under the application of an electric field, its magnitude and direction can be controlled.4 Although the capability of ferroelectrics in tuning the optoelectronic properties is known, it is widely explored in oxide perovskites and not in halide perovskites. The latter materials are good photovoltaic materials with phenomenal photovoltaic power conversion efficiencies reaching over 25%.5,6 So, combining the polarization effect to halide perovskites can provide new opportunities for highly efficient devices. Considering the importance of polarization in photovoltaic materials, we provide a detailed material design strategy in this review to impart above-room-temperature ferroelectrics based on the reported halide perovskites. Their application and their future potential in optoelectronic devices are also discussed.
Ferroelectricity was born nearly 100 years ago when Valasek reported the first hysteresis curve in Rochelle salt (NaKC4H4O6·4H2O).7 He found that the crystal was polarizing, and the direction of polarity can be switched under an external electric field.7,8 This discovery was a breakthrough in the field of ferroelectricity. Since then, a lot of ferroelectric materials have been discovered and investigated. The fundamental point of interest in ferroelectrics is that they possess spontaneous polarization with switchable behavior under an external electric field, and undergo a transition from the non-centrosymmetric to centrosymmetric phase upon heating above a certain temperature called the Curie Temperature (TC). Ceramic materials are good dielectric materials with the ability to shift the charges under an applied external electric field that results in the orientation of dipoles. Several dielectrics have been reported as ferroelectrics, especially the perovskite oxide family with an ABO3 structure, such as BaTiO3, PbTiO3, BiFeO3, LaFeO3 and SrTiO3.9,10 These ferroelectric materials have been explored for a variety of applications, including light-emitting diodes,11,12 solar cells,13 transistors,14,15 memory devices,16,17 photodetectors,18–20 and solar water splitting.21–28
Semiconductors for high efficiency devices should possess good optoelectronic properties coupled with effective photogenerated charge carrier separation. Conventional semiconducting materials undergo charge separation predominantly due to a carrier concentration gradient or electric field. However, in ferroelectric systems, the polarity induced within the material generates microscopic electric fields across the domains, which separates photo-generated carriers. This reduces the parasitic recombination rates, leading to better charge-collection efficiency. BaTiO3 was one of the early reported photovoltaic non-centrosymmetric materials.29 The measurements performed on ferroelectric BaTiO3 films revealed an increase of four orders of magnitude in the photoinduced electric field generation. This leads to an enhancement of the charge separation, resulting in efficient light conversion.30 The photocurrents were related to the sign and the magnitude of the polarization of the sample. Similar effects were reported in LiNbO3 and LiTaO3.31 This is a unique feature of the ferroelectric material, where the sign of photovoltage/current can be switched by changing the direction of polarization. In addition, a series of studies showed that BiFeO3 has promising applications as a photoferroic material in photovoltaic devices.32,33 In conventional PV devices, the maximum photovoltage can be equal to the bandgap of the semiconductor.21,22 However, due to the presence of polarized domains separated by domain walls in ferroelectric materials, each of the domains acts as a solar cell and lead to an above-bandgap photovoltage (anomalous photovoltaic effect).1,2,34,35 Work by Glass has shown that the photovoltage can reach up to 1600 V for doped LiNbO3, and it is hundreds of times higher than its optical band gap.2 Of particular interest is the visible light absorbing BiFeO3, which exhibits high ferroelectric transition temperature (TC),36,37 a giant polarization for thin films,38 and an above -and gap photovoltage of 50 V.39,40 This specific anomalous photovoltaic behavior makes these ferroelectric materials exciting for next-generation solar cells.23,24,33,39,41,42
Polarized electrode materials have been extensively explored in photocatalytic (PC)/photoelectrochemical (PEC) solar water splitting. In general, ferroelectric materials provide an additional internal electric field at the semiconductor-electrolyte interface to enhance the charge separation or reduce recombination in these PC/PEC devices.43 In the past, many ferroelectric materials (including SrTiO3, BiFeO3 and PbTiO3) have been reported as photoanodes/photocathodes in PEC solar fuel systems.28,44–48 Among them, BiFeO3 possesses high built-in potential that enhances the photogenerated charge carrier separation, leading to a photocurrent density of 0.055 mA cm−2 and 0.2 mA cm−2 in the photoanode and photocathode, respectively.28,46 Another ferroelectric material, SrTiO3 with bandgap of 3.2–3.4 eV showed 20% power conversion efficiency.45 These reports show that ferroelectric materials are great options for solar energy conversion. However, their high bandgap, low absorption coefficient and poor conductivity need to be addressed in order to obtain high efficiency devices.
The perovskite oxide BiFeO3 is one of the small number of visible light-absorbing ferroelectric semiconductors with a narrow bandgap of 2.2–2.8 eV.49–51 The carrier concentration and absorption coefficient of BiFeO3 are relatively higher at 5.4 × 1017 cm−3 and ∼105 cm−1, respectively.52,53 In spite of the better semiconducting and absorption properties, BiFeO3 lags behind halide perovskites, as the latter materials possess high charge carrier concentration, good absorption coefficient and optimum bandgap for optoelectronic applications. The standard CH3NH3PbI3, for example, shows panchromatic visible light absorption with a bandgap of nearly 1.6 eV and has a high carrier concentration of ∼1018 cm−3.5,54,55 So, it is worthwhile to introduce the ferroelectric properties in halide perovskites for high-performance optoelectronic devices. Specifically, the materials that possess above-room temperature ferroelectrics are highly preferred. Most of the devices, including solar cells, LEDs, and photodetectors, operate at or above room temperature (RT) conditions. If the material possesses a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure below RT, then the role of polarization on charge separation will be zero at or above RT. So, while designing the material, it is essential to introduce polar chemical moieties which do not undergo transition to non-polar phases near RT. A higher transition temperature provides a larger window of device operation.
The 3D halide perovskites with general formula ABX3 (A and B are monovalent and divalent cations, respectively, and X is a halide) have been extensively studied as semiconducting materials for photovoltaic, photocatalytic, and other light-harvesting applications. The ease of processing and a structure that can be tuned makes the halide perovskites a suitable candidate for a variety of optoelectronic devices. The three-dimensional ABX3 and its layered 2D analogue RmAn−1BnX3n+1 consist of inorganic [BX6]4− octahedra, where R is a large positive charge organic spacer, A is an organic/inorganic cation, B is a metal cation, and X is a halide ion.56–58 Solar cells made with α-FAPbI3 (FA – formamidinium) have shown excellent power conversion efficiency of over 24.8% when used with fluorinated isomers of spiro-OMeTAD as the hole transport layer.59 Another high efficiency work with over 25.8% solar cell was reported, where an interlayer was formed between a SnO2 electron transport layer and light-absorbing perovskite (FASnClx).6 Tandem solar cells with a perovskite absorber and silicon bottom cells led to a very high PCE of 28.2%.60 All of these reports show the excellent optoelectronic properties of halide perovskites. There are reports showing the existence of ferroelectricity in CH3NH3PbI3 due to the observation of polar domains under piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), and it has also shown weak ferroelectricity in dielectric and piezoelectric measurements. However, it has still not shown the saturated spontaneous polarization under the effect of an electric field.61,62
In spite of the high efficiency and some reports on polarization, their stability in ambient conditions is poor. Hence, the introduction of a large hydrophobic organic cation to create two-dimensional perovskites was found to be a better strategy.63–66 While the ABX3 structure has fairly rigid structural constraints, one can explore within a broader extended family of lower-dimensional perovskites. This then allows for a remarkable structural tunability, i.e., from the parent 3D structure, based upon the corner-shared BX6 octahedra, all the way down to 2D, 1D and zero-dimensional (0D) [BX6]y− octahedral clusters.67 This structural flexibility and tunability by changing the A/B site cations can play a crucial role in achieving high polarization in ferroelectrics.68 The large organic cations located in the space between the metal halide anionic frameworks have much freedom to exhibit an order–disorder transition in the material, which is one of the major factors to induce ferroelectricity in a material. The 2D perovskites have attracted greater attention than their 3D counterparts due to the better ambient stability.69–72 The 2D perovskites have natural quantum well structures due to the alternating stakes of organic and inorganic layers. In addition, organic layers introduce dielectric confinement that lead to the extremely large exciton binding energy, which can be beneficial for the ferroelectric property of the material.73 Changing the layer number and chemical compositions endows the 2D perovskites with great flexibility for various optoelectronic applications.74,75
The generation of ferroelectric domains in these stable two-dimensional halide perovskites can reduce the recombination rates of carriers and possibly further enhance the performance.76 The importance of this class of materials can be seen by the increase in the number of papers published every year (Fig. 1). The number of above-room temperature 2D halide perovskite ferroelectric materials contribute to more than 80% of all reported ferroelectric halide perovskite materials.

In this review, we will provide the detailed materials' design principles and complete summary of the reported above-room-temperature halide perovskite ferroelectric materials, followed by their applications. We first introduce our readers to the basics of ferroelectricity in a material, followed by a discussion on the introduction of ferroelectricity in halide perovskites by targeting the design of organic cations.65,76,77 The design approach includes alloying structures with polar molecules, halide substitution, and the introduction of homochirality in the organic cationic site.78–80 These strategies are shown to increase the Curie temperature (TC) and spontaneous polarization (Ps).81 We have prepared a list of 28 unique above-room-temperature 2D halide ferroelectrics with their phase transition behavior, ferroelectric and optical properties. We also illustrated the fields of applications, which garner the benefits from optoelectronics and ferroelectricity to achieve high-efficiency devices. We concluded with a brief discussion on the future of 2D halide perovskite ferroelectrics in photovoltaic and solar fuel applications, and a need to discover new materials in this field.
2. Fundamentals of ferroelectricity
The ferroelectricity was first studied in Rochelle salt single crystals in 1921 by Valasek.7 From then, this property has been explored in a wide range of materials with versatile technological applications, including capacitors,82–84 sensors,85,86 transducers,87 pyroelectric devices,88 photovoltaic devices,13 photodetectors,18,19 microwave phase filters,89 and memory devices.16,17
Ferroelectric materials are non-linear dielectric materials with a lack of spatial-inversion symmetry in their crystal structure. Among the 32-point groups in crystallography, 11 show the center of symmetry and the remaining 21 are non-centrosymmetric groups with one exception. So, only 20 have the polar properties that make them piezoelectric. Ten of these 20-point groups have no net polarization, and the remaining 10 possess a unique polar axis even without any external force, i.e., C1, C2, C1h, C2V, C3, C3V, C4, C4V, C6 and C6V.78
Ferroelectricity is a switchable polarization property in a material under an external electric field (E), and has finite polarization (P) at zero electric field. The films or crystals of these materials possess multiple ferroelectric domains or regions, where all of the electric dipoles aligned in the same direction are separated by domain walls. The orientation of the dipoles in the original or as-synthesized material is random in the absence of voltage, showing net zero polarization. However, they can fully align themselves under an applied electric field. The alignment of dipoles depends upon the direction of the field. The switchable behavior of these domains is observed from their characteristic property (called hysteresis) measured from the P–E hysteresis loop. Fig. 2 shows a typical P–E loop observed for ferroelectric materials. At zero electric field (E), the net polarization is zero, but the domains start to align themselves with E. The polarization (P) value increases along the OA curve with the increase in the electric field strength, and eventually reaches a saturation polarization (point A) also known as spontaneous polarization (PS). The value of PS does not change with further increase in the external bias. Upon reversing the E to zero (AB), some of the domains remain polarized along the same direction. The value of polarization at zero electric field is called the remnant polarization Pr (OB). The crystal is depolarized (BC) when the reverse electric field reaches the coercive field strength EC (OC). With the further increase in E in the reverse direction (CP), the dipoles start to align themselves in the negative direction to achieve −PS (polarization at point P) and −Pr (OQ) values, and the hysteresis loop continues along the PQRA curve.
 Fig. 2  A typical P (polarization)–E (electric field) hysteresis loop observed in a ferroelectric material. 
The curve shown in Fig. 2 represents the P–E loop hysteresis, and it is different from the hysteresis being observed in the J–V (current density – voltage) curves in the halide perovskite photovoltaic devices. The J–V hysteresis is shown to affect the measurement of the solar cell efficiency. The former (P–E loop) is carried out to identify the electric field required to align the dipoles in a given direction to obtain the maximum polarization. The hysteresis in the P–E loop arises from the difference in the energy required to align the electric dipoles in different directions of an applied field. Typically, the voltage applied for ferroelectric films or pellets is in the order of tens of volts to hundreds of volts. In contrast, the J–V hysteresis in solar cells is observed between 0 V and VOC (<1.5 V). The commonality between these two phenomena is the movement of ions or ion migration under an applied electric field.90–95
Ferroelectric materials experience a temperature-dependent structural transition to the non-polar paraelectric phase. The temperature (T) at which the ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition occurs is called the Curie temperature (TC). For T > TC, the material shows centrosymmetric behavior with no net polarization at zero applied electric field. Meanwhile, for T < TC, it remains non-centrosymmetric or polar. This phase transition occurs either by order–disorder and displacive modes, depending on the thermal motion of the atoms that control the symmetry.96 During the displacive transition, atoms in the crystal undergo small harmonic oscillations around their average positions, which results in the relative displacement of atoms. This leads to the generation of net polarization. Fig. 3 shows a classic example of a cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition in BaTiO3.97,98 In the paraelectric phase, Ba2+ cations occupy the corners of the unit cell, Ti4+ at the body-centered position, and O2− at the center of the faces. In the tetragonal phase, an off-centered movement of Ti4+ generates the polarization. If the transition is because of the atom hopping between the equilibrium positions, then that transition is considered to be order–disorder. This is like in sodium nitrate (NaNO2), where the polar NO2 molecules shift to a random orientation in the disordered state.99–101 The ferroelectric materials may also show both displacive and order–disorder transition behavior.
 Fig. 3  BaTiO3 structure with a cubic structure in the paraelectric phase and the tetragonal structure in the ferroelectric phase. 
So far, studies on the impact of ferroelectricity on the J–V hysteresis are limited to a few materials, especially CH3NH3PbI3. Seol et al. studied this impact using temperature-dependent piezo force microscopy (PFM) and scan-rate-dependent nano/macroscopic measurements.91 It was concluded that the macroscopic J–V response arises from ionic movement, and the nanoscopic J–V behavior is attributed to ferroelectricity. The ion migration is shown to be a major cause of hysteresis in halide perovskites. It is hypothesized that the higher Curie temperature (TC) in the ferroelectrics can overcome the ion mobility because ion movement is significant near the TC. There have been reports on J–V curves in oxide perovskite photovoltaics,33,39 but no specific information on J–V hysteresis is available. Based on the reported information, we believe a material with high Curie temperature shall be expected to have lower ion movement at RT. In turn, this will reduce the J–V hysteresis in solar cells.
3. Ways to implement ferroelectricity
The 2D HOIP materials have flexibility in selecting a variety of organic/inorganic cations and halogens to tune the ferroelectric properties for better optoelectronic performance in devices. Herein, the design of the A-site cations in the ferroelectric perovskite halide modulates the molecular dipole moment, which will offer a good platform to investigate, design, and develop a new class of halide ferroelectrics.63 The “quasi-spherical theory” has been proposed to provide a systematic design approach by means of cation engineering to introduce and tune ferroelectricity in molecular materials.79,102 This theory discusses the introduction of the dipole moment, lowering symmetry in crystal structures, and creating ferroelectricity with the introduction of specific chemical groups. The “quasi-spherical theory” refers to the modification of an organic cation in the high temperature phase to maintain the high-speed rotation of molecules, and a dynamically disordered state for the order–disorder interaction between organic and inorganic ions. Factors, such as the molecular interactions between the anion and cation, their weight and size, play important roles in causing deformation during the phase transition, contributing to effective spontaneous polarization. It has been clearly observed that modification of the structural characteristics, intermolecular interactions, and homochirality can be used as a tool to effectively design molecular ferroelectrics.103 These concepts have been extended from molecular ferroelectricity to two-dimensional halide perovskites by the introduction of organic cations (aliphatic or aromatic ammonium), halogen substitution in organic cations, and homochirality, leading to polarized ferroelectric materials. The tunability of the optoelectronic properties in the 2D material coupled with ferroelectrics shall enhance the charge carrier separation and reduce the recombination rate for highly efficient PC/PV/PEC devices.65,76
In this review, we bundled various reported strategies for tuning the ferroelectric properties under three categories: alloying of organic cations, halogen substitution, and homochirality. The summary of all of the above-room-temperature 2D ferroelectric perovskite halides and their organic sites are illustrated in Table 1 and Fig. 4–7.

3.1. Alloying with organic cations
There are number of reports85,104–110 regarding the alloying of the organic cations into the A-site of a three-dimensional halide perovskite (general formula of ABX3). The alloying process resulted in lower dimensional organic–inorganic hybrids with improved stability, optical and ferroelectric properties. For a three-dimensional material to crystallize in the perovskite phase, the Goldschmidt tolerance factor limits the size of the A-site cation to a maximum of 2.6 Å.111 Conversely, for their 2D counterparts, the Goldschmidt tolerance factor is relaxed. Hence, comparatively larger A-site cations such as butylammonium (BA+), phenylmethylammonium (PMA+) or phenylethylammonium (PEA+) can be accommodated, which opens the scope for the incorporation of a large number of organic cations. The introduction of a larger organic cation in the A-site will result in the separation of neighboring [BX6]4− octahedra layers in one of the dimensions, yielding the 2D perovskite structure.112 This organic cation plays a crucial role in the design of 2D halide perovskite ferroelectrics, as the cation with an enlarged molecular dipole will result in polarization. It has been shown that the ordering of the dipole moment from the organic spacers leads to polarization, and the disordering at high temperatures leads to the transition from ferroelectric to paraelectric.113Fig. 5 shows fourteen different ferroelectric 2D halide perovskites with their corresponding polarization direction and values. We arranged them as per the value of n in R2An−1BnX3n+1 (R is an organic monovalent cation, A is an organic/inorganic monovalent cation, B is a divalent cation, and X is a halide anion): O-1 to O-6, O-7 to O-9 and O-10 to O-17 correspond to n = 1, 2 and 3, respectively (Table 1).

Among the 2D perovskites with n = 1, BZA2PbCl4 (O-4) is one of the earliest known ferroelectric materials with high polarization values and good semiconducting properties, which is of great importance for optoelectronic applications. The crystal structure analysis of this material showed that the material crystallizes in the non-centrosymmetric space group Cmc21 at 293 K. However, a transition to the paraelectric phase (Cmca) was observed at 438 K. The non-centrosymmetric phase (293 K) shows an ordered alignment of the C–N bonds of the organic cation along the c-axis, leading to a net spontaneous polarization (Ps). The P–E loop analysis done at 383 K revealed the saturation polarization (Ps) of 13 μC cm−2. The phase transition temperature TC of 438 K was reported using dielectric anomaly and differential scanning calorimetry,114 which are comparable to BaTiO3.115 The optical analysis showed the direct bandgap of 3.65 eV and displayed narrow ultraviolet photoluminescence emission. Theoretical analysis for (BZA)2PbCl4 suggested that the polarization arises both from the dipole alignment in the polar organic cations, and due to the associated distortion introduced in inorganic octahedra layers.116
(Bis-cyclohexylammonium)2PbBr4 (O-6) is another 2D organic–inorganic layered halide perovskite that possesses photoferroelectric properties, and show anisotropic bulk photovoltaic (BPV) behavior. Similar to O-4, this material showed a phase transition from Cmc21 to Cmca with a TC of 364 K. The decrease in the transition temperature to the non-ferroelectric phase of O-6 is attributed to the total dipole associated with its organic cation and the corresponding distortion it induced in the material. However, the photoconducting properties of this material have been shown to be comparable to conventional CH3NH3PbI3 with good carrier transport along the inorganic layers, and it possessed a photovoltage of 0.98 V. O-6 possessed a bandgap of 2.95 eV with remnant polarization along the c-direction at 6.5 μC cm−2 (P–E loop).104
A-site tuning with the 4-aminotetrahydropyran cation resulted in O-5 with the highest transition temperature of 503 K with a spontaneous polarization of 5.6 μC cm−2 among all of the reported above-room-temperature 2D perovskite halides.85 The (butylammonium)2PbCl4 (O-1) showed that the orientation of the organic cations resulted in a ferroelectric nature. Due to the distortion introduced in the [PbCl6]4− octahedra, the material showed broadband white light emission.117 Most of the compounds with n = 1 possess a wide bandgap with the exception of O-3, which has 2.38 eV, and absorbs in the visible region. There was another organic cation, methylhydrazinium (MHy+), that was also incorporated between the octahedra layers to modify the polar properties (O-2).118 The study on AMP2PbI4 (O-3) (where AMP is [4-(aminomethyl) piperidinium]) showed the Rashba effect and ferroelectricity with a spontaneous polarization of 9.8 μC cm−2 and phase transition temperature of 353 K, which is above room temperature. This DJ (Dion-Jacobson) perovskite is said to be more stable because of the replacement of the van der Waals gap by the diammonium cation, which is bonded to inorganic layers on both sides. O-3 belongs to the n = 1 (monolayer) perovskite with an optical bandgap of 2.38 eV and photoluminescence centered at 523 nm. The structural analysis revealed its crystallization in the non-centrosymmetric monoclinic Pc phase at room temperature, which is the ferroelectric and centrosymmetric P21/c paraelectric phase at 373 K. The ferroelectricity in this material originated from the ordered organic cation, which broke the Shockley–Queisser limit through the bulk PV effect. The symmetry breaking from ferroelectricity with spin-orbit coupling gave rise to the Rashba splitting in HOIP.106
The multilayer perovskites with n > 1 were shown to improve the absorption spectrum coupled with the benefits of the conventional ABX3 halide perovskites. In 2017, Li et al. reported a 2D multilayered ferroelectric perovskite BA2MA2Pb3Br10 (O-13). Similar to compounds with n = 1, the ferroelectricity in this class of material is generated as the result of the asymmetry created in the octahedra and ordered state of the organic moieties. The O-13 crystal was synthesized using a temperature cooling method. The single crystal analysis showed an orthorhombic system with a non-centrosymmetric space group Cmc21 at room temperature and centrosymmetric group Cmca above Tc, where Tc = 315 K. In addition, the Ps and bandgap were reported to be 2.9 μC cm−2 and 2.4 eV, respectively. O-13 showed good photoelectric properties with an on/off ratio of 2.5 × 103, detectivity of 3.6 × 1010 Jones, rise time of 150 μs, and decay time of 570 μs.107
Similar multi-layered perovskite ferroelectric materials were later reported, including BA2CsPb2Br7 (O-7),109 BA2MAPb2Br7 (O-8),119 BA2FAPb2Br7 (O-9),120 in 2018, EA2MA2Pb3Br10 (O-12), BA2EA2Pb3Br10 (O-15),119,122,124 in 2019 and IA2MA2Pb3Br10 (O-16),105 in 2020. Furthermore, the ferroelectrics of the biaxial trilayered perovskite EA4Pb3Br10 (O-11)121 and EA4Pb3Cl10 (O-10) trilayered lead chloride perovskite110 with modified general formula of EA2An−1BnX3n+1 were reported in 2019 and 2020, respectively, and opened a scope of new design strategies in 2D multilayered perovskite ferroelectrics. (BA)2(EA)2Pb3Br10 and (IA)2(MA)2Pb3Br10 show the highest Ps of 5 μC cm−2, and (butylammonium)2CsPb2Br7 shows one of the highest Tc of 412 K among the lead-based multilayered perovskites.
In 2020, a lead-free alternative (C4H9NH3)2(NH3CH3)2Sn3Br10 (O-17) with the trilayered Ruddlesden–Popper (R–P) phase was reported for the above class of materials, where the molecular motion of the organic amines and lone-pair of electrons in Sn2+ induce structural distortion, which readily generates spontaneous polarization.108 The P–E loop gives highest Ps = 11.76 among the multilayered perovskites, with TC of 318 K. Further thermal analysis of O-17 revealed the material stability up to 502 K, and the optical analysis yielded a bandgap of 2.22 eV, making (C4H9NH3)2(NH3CH3)2Sn3Br10 an exciting choice for photovoltaics. The ferroelectricity in this material was further proved using piezoresponse force microscopy, showing its multiaxial polarization behavior and switchable polarization.108 It should be noted that for n ≥ 2, the PS value is low on average. Furthermore, the bandgap of these materials lie in the visible region with the exception of O-10.
These 17 different materials from O-1 to O-17 show that the organic cations play an important role in the design and development of 2D perovskite halide ferroelectrics with above-room-temperature TC.
3.2. Halogen substitution in organic cations
The organic cation spacers at the R-site in 2D perovskites serve an important role in tuning the ferroelectric properties. In the molecular ferroelectrics domain, significant efforts were made to synthesize ferroelectric semiconductors with a systematic and targeted chemical design of organic molecules. One of the effective methods to introduce or enhance polarization is to impart the so-called ‘deuteration effect’. Here, the increase in the mass of the hydrogen isotope to deuterium leads to no change in the polar point group, but enhances the spontaneous polarization.136,137 Similar to the deuteration in molecular ferroelectrics, the introduction of a heavy fluorine atom in the organic spacers of 2D perovskites has been shown to polarize the material (Fig. 6).
 Fig. 6  Ferroelectric (left) and paraelectric (right) crystal structures of (a) FBZA2PbCl4 (FBZA = 2-fluorobenzylammonium); (b) pFBZA2PbBr4 (pFBZA = perfluorobenzylammonium); (c) DFCHA2PbI4 (DFCHA = 4,4-difluorocyclohexylammonium); (d) DFPD2PbI4 (DFPD = 4,4-difluoropiperidinium); (e) DFPD4AgBiI8 (DFPD = 4,4-difluoropiperidinium); (f) DFHHA2PbI4 (DFHHA = 4,4-difluorohexahydroazepinium); (g) CPA4AgBiBr8 (CPA = chloropropylammonium); (h) BPA2FAPb2Br7 (BPA = 3-bromopropylammonium, FA = formamidinium). Horizontal black arrows represent the polarization direction. Hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity. 
The fluorine substitution in 2D HOIP ferroelectric materials leads to minimum structural disorder since the hydrogen and fluorine have similar steric parameters and van der Waal's radii. The high electronegativity of fluorine enhances the molecular dipole moment, giving rise to the spontaneous polarisation.138,139 This substitution is expected to increase the Curie temperature as a result of the potential energy barrier for the tumbling motion of the organic cations.
In 2001, before the era of the present-day halide perovskites, Mitzi et al. reported on what was possibly the first 2D material FPEA2SnI4 (FPEA – 4-fluorophenethylammonium) with a fluorinated A-site organic cation. This material crystallized in the non-ferroelectric space group P21/c. The electronic properties of these materials investigated using thin-film field effect transistors showed exciting results.140 Recent works have involved a systematic fluorine substitution in a benzylammonium-based organic spacer. The unsubstituted BZA perovskite is shown in O-4. The monofluorinated derivative of benzylammonium, 2-fluorobenzylammonium (FBZA), was used as a cation to develop the new ferroelectric semiconductor FBZA2PbCl4 (H-1). It retained the Cmc21 ferroelectric space group like its parent non-fluorinated O-4. Above TC, the material converts to nonpolar I4/mmm. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and second harmonic generation (SHG) measurements confirmed the phase transition to the non-polar phase at around 448 K for H-1, which is 10 K higher than that of the parent compound O-4. The fluorine substitution at the third and fourth positions of benzylammonium led to the formation of the two-dimensional perovskites, [3-fluoro-benzylammonium]2PbCl4 and [4-fluorobenzylammonium]2PbCl4, respectively, but they crystallized in a non-ferroelectric spacegroup.125 This research demonstrates the importance of fluorination at selective sites to align the dipole in a given direction to achieve net polarization in materials.
The dipole contribution from the C–F bond (2.0D) is higher than that from the C–H bond (1.4D), and is expected to impact the PS value.63,125 However, H-1 is reported to have 5.35 μC cm−2, which is lower than O-4. The dipole contribution from all of the polar components should be analyzed in order to understand the reduction in the net polarization in H-1. The optical bandgap for FBZA2PbCl4 is 3.62 eV. It is similar to its non-fluorinated counterpart BZA2PbCl4 (3.65 eV), as the inorganic octahedra formed by the metal cation and chloride anion are responsible for the formation of the conduction band minimum and valence band maximum.114 The same research group reported another above-room-temperature ferroelectric fluorinated compound, i.e., [perfluorobenzylammonium]2PbBr4 (H-2) with TC and PS of 440 K and 4.2 μC cm−2, respectively.141
Unlike the benzylammonium cation, some ammonium cations do not crystallize perovskites in the ferroelectric phase, but their fluorinated analogues form polarized phases (H-3 to H-6). Sha et al. used difluorination to trigger the ferroelectricity in [cyclohexylammonium]2PbI4.142,143 The group synthesized the [4,4-difluorocyclohexylammonium]2PbI4 (DFCHA2PbI4, H-3) that holds the ferroelectricity above-room-temperature. The phase transition occurs at 377 K and it changes from the polar Cmc21 to nonpolar Pbca space group. H-3 possesses a band gap of 2.38 eV and its non-fluorinated analogue [CHA]2PbI4 has 2.33 eV. Like H-1 & O-4, the fluorination of the organic spacer in H-3 does not affect the optical bandgap.
The H/F substitution in a nonferroelectric [piperidinium]PbI3 led to the formation of ferroelectric [4,4-difluoropiperidinium]2PbI4 (DFPD2PbI4, H-4). It crystallizes in the polar monoclinic space group Aba2, and undergoes transition into the paraelectric phase with the I4/mmm space group above TC.128 DFPD2PbI4 shows ferroelectricity with large PS of 10 μC cm−2 and TC of 428.5 K. The lead-free version of H-4, DFPD4AgBiI8 (H-5),144 also shows excellent TC (422 K) and PS (10.5 μC cm−2). The H-5 is actually an extension of the double perovskites with the general formula A2BB′X6, where the introduction of a large A site organic spacer led to a two-dimensional system. It is very well known that the B site in ABX3 is dominated by Pb2+ and to some extent, Sn2+ cations. However, in the case of double perovskites, there are multiple possibilities to tune the two distinct monovalent (e.g., Ag+, Na+) and trivalent (e.g., Bi3+, In3+, Sb3+) metal sites.145,146 The latter class of material offers more flexibility in tuning the structural entities to obtain appropriate optoelectronic properties, and they are relatively more stable than the ABX3 systems.147–149
A 1D non-ferroelectric organic–inorganic halide compound [hexahydroazepine]PbI3 becomes the 2D layered ferroelectric perovskite, [4,4-difluorohexahydroazepine]2PbI4 (DFHHA2PbI4, H-6), upon fluorination.130 It shows a moderate PS of 1.1 μC cm−2 at room temperature, direct bandgap of 2.32 eV and TC of 454 K. These materials from H-3 to H-6 represent a proof-of-concept to use the H/F-substituted molecular tailoring as an excellent design strategy to introduce polarization and above-room-temperature ferroelectrics in the halide perovskites.
Similar to fluoride substitution, a few reports have demonstrated that the chloride and bromide substitutions are also effective for introducing ferroelectricity in perovskites. The dimensional reduction of the halide double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 to (chloropropylammonium)4AgBiBr8 (CPA4AgBiBr8, H-7)131 using an asymmetric organic spacer led to an above-room-temperature ferroelectric material. The ordered organic spacer and octahedra tilting resulted in PS of 3.2 μC cm−2 and TC of 305 K. The chloride substitution leads to a large molecular dipole moment with a ferroelectric–paraelectric transition from the polar PC to non-polar Pbam space groups. The bromide substitution in the propylammonium cation form (bromopropylammonium)2PbBr4 (BPA2PbBr4, H-8),132 and its bilayered analogue with the mixture of fomamidinium and bromopropyl ammonium cation (H-9), led to a non-centrosymmetric ferroelectric material.133 Considering the lower electronegativity of chloride and bromide compared to fluoride, in a given organic linker and crystal structure, the latter substitution can lead to higher net spontaneous polarization.
Halide substitution in organic spacers is one of the important strategies to introduce ferroelectricity and improve the Curie temperature. The systematic introduction of halides at selective sites can lead to the alignment of dipoles, leading to net polarization in perovskite materials.
3.3. Homochirality
The Rochelle salt is the first known homochiral compound that has shown ferroelectric properties. Homochiral ferroelectric materials can be prepared either by using a combination of homochiral molecules, or a combination of homochiral molecules and metal cation/framework. The halide perovskite ferroelectric material falls in the latter category.103,150 In crystallography, homochirality is represented as the absence of mirror symmetry. The chiral materials typically crystallize in one of the following 11 chiral point groups: C1, C2, D2, C3, D3, C4, D4, C6, D6, T, and O.103,150,151 The point groups C1, C2, C3, C4 and C6 are polar. Hence, they are expected to form ferroelectric materials.103
The multicomponent assembly of homochiral organic ions with metals or halides is a known phenomenon in the ferroelectric community.152–157 The latest advent of lead halide perovskites for high performance photovoltaics accelerated the discovery of new ferroelectrics with the [PbX6]4− octahedra-based framework with homochiral organic cations. There are at least two above-room-temperature ferroelectric 2D homochiral perovskite compounds (C-1 & C-2) reported in the recent literature, and the details are given in Fig. 7 and Table 1. One of the compounds was based on [(R)-1-(4-chlorophenyl)ethylammonium]2PbI4 and [(S)-1-(4-chlorophenyl)ethylammonium]2PbI4 (C-1) with the above-room-temperature phase transition at 473.2 K, multiaxial ferroelectricity and semiconducting behavior with a direct bandgap of 2.34 eV.134 The obtained spontaneous polarization value was the highest, ∼14 μC cm−2, among all of the reported above-room-temperature ferroelectric perovskites. The vibrational circular dichroism spectra of these compounds showed mirror images, representing the chiral nature of these organic systems inside the perovskite crystal. However, their racemic material did not show any chiral behavior. Another class of chiral perovskite compounds, [(R)-N-(1-phenylethyl)ethane-1,2-diaminium]PbI4 and [(S)-N-(1-phenylethyl)ethane-1,2-diaminium]PbI4, showed above-room-temperature TC with a moderate polarization of 0.15 μC cm−2.
 Fig. 7  Homochiral R (left) and Homochiral S (right) crystal structures of (a) [(R and S)-LIPF] (LIPF = [1-(4-chlorophenylethylammonium)]2PbI4); (b) [(R and S)-PEDA]PbI4 (PEDA = N-(1-phenylethyl)ethane-1,2-diaminium). 
Apart from the abovementioned 2D homochiral materials, there are other low-dimensional materials (1D) that show ferroelectric behavior. In one of the recent reports, the one-dimensional [(R)-(−)-1-cyclohexylethylammonium]PbI3 and [(S)-(+)-1-cyclohexylethylammonium]PbI3 showed above-room-temperature spontaneous polarization.158 There are also a handful of below-room temperature homochiral ferroelectric perovskite materials reported in the literature.159 These works show that there is an enormous opportunity to utilize the existing homochiral molecular cations to synthesize ferroelectric materials.
Homochiral molecular ferroelectrics are also used in perovskite solar cell fabrication to increase the built-in electric field of the film, providing effective charge separation and transport. In addition, the defect passivation in the active layer of the perovskite in the case of the molecular ferroelectric component of the perovskite solar cell will induce a roughly eightfold increase in the photoluminescence intensity and reduction in the electron trap state density.160
Overall, the published reports employed the aforementioned three major design strategies to synthesize above-room-temperature ferroelectrics. The introduction of polar cationic moieties in the A site, enhancement of the dipole by substituting highly electronegative constituents like fluorinated organic cations, and the introduction of chirality are all shown to impart ferroelectricity in 2D halide perovskites.79,102,103,150,153,161,162 The molecular design strategy with H/F substitution resembles the H/D isotopic effect and greatly enhances the Curie temperature (TC) due to an increase in the rotational energy barrier of the fluorinated molecules.103,163–165 This improvement has been reported in fluorinated compounds in comparison to their non-fluorinated counterparts.81,125,126,166–169 Moreover, the higher electronegativity of the fluorine atom compared to the carbon atom may result in enhancement of the dipole moment that improves the ferroelectric polarization. Substitution with larger ionic radii halogens, i.e., chlorine and bromine, has also resulted in ferroelectricity, but possesses low net dipole because of lower electronegativity compared to fluorine.131,132,134 Ferroelectric materials crystallize in one of the 10 polar point groups, out of which 5 are chiral, which means that introducing the homochiral molecules is a rational strategy to develop ferroelectric behavior.
The dipole behavior and molecular orientation of the organic cation plays an important role in the phase transition of halide perovskites. The organic cation has an asymmetric charge distribution that results in a net dipole moment. In addition, the molecular orientation of the organic cation is temperature-dependent for a specific phase transition to occur. It has also been observed in the field of molecular ferroelectrics that the selection of the organic cation plays an important role in the symmetry breaking and ferroelectric properties of these materials.78 Jiangsu et al. discussed in detail about a systematic design approach to achieve molecular ferroelectricity.79 The importance of the selection of organic cations based on the quasi-spherical and momentum-matching theory is explained. These concepts from molecular ferroelectrics can be extended to the layered halide perovskite to emphasize the role of the organic cations.103 Overall, the dipole moment and the contribution of the polar organic cations to the distortion or asymmetry in the octahedra layer decide the net polarization in the 2D halide perovskites. The larger organic cations offer high steric hindrance, leading to the distortion in the octahedra layer. However, the net dipole moment associated with this distortion is expected to be minimal compared to the highly polar organic substituents. These conclusions are drawn from molecular ferroelectrics, and there is no detailed experimental investigation that explains the role of organic cations (in Fig. 4) to the ferroelectricity in the perovskite materials.
4. Applications
To date, a number of above-room-temperature halide perovskite ferroelectrics have been used for a wide variety of applications, including photodetectors, solar cells, piezoelectric and light-emitting devices.
4.1. Photodetectors
Photodetectors are light detection sensors that convert light into electric signals.122,170–178 The polarization in 2D HOIP has been successfully utilized for a wide variety of photodetectors, including UV-photodetectors, X-ray detectors, and polarized detectors.107,110,119,122–124,131,132 The performance of these devices are determined by a range of parameters, including photocurrent density, on/off ratio, responsivity, dark current value, quantum efficiency, detectivity, rise and decay time, sensitivity and charge carrier mobility.171

4.1.1. Self-powered UV photodetectors. 
In 2019, Liu et al. reported on the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) in plate-like EA2MA2Pb3Br10 (O-12) crystals.122 A well-polished single crystal sputtered with symmetric gold contacts was used as a photodetector (Fig. 8a). Upon irradiation with a 405 nm laser beam, the device generated a photocurrent density of 4.1 μA cm−2 without any external voltage bias. This is reported to be significantly higher than the well-known perovskite oxide BaTiO3 (0.136 μA cm−2).179 This photodetector also exhibited an extremely low dark current on the order of a few femtoamperes and a large on/off current ratio of ∼106. The dark current value is very good compared to the ∼1 pA of ZnO/GaN-based p–n devices.180 The rise and decay times are 96 and 123 μs, respectively, which are good for fast detection. As EA2MA2Pb3Br10 is a ferroelectric material, upon reversing the polarization, the signs of the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current density (ISC) are switched. In addition, the detection was observed only along the direction of polarization, which is the unique property of the ferroelectric materials. The trilayered 2D organic–inorganic perovskite halide EA4Pb3Cl10 (O-10) was also employed for UV detection.110 O-10 crystals were prepared by slowly cooling the saturated precursor solution at a rate of 1 K per day down to room temperature. It shows a VOC of 150 mV and ISC of 40.63 nA cm−2 under 266 nm illumination. For the intensity of 7.09 mW mm−2, the crystal showed JSC of 18.6 μA cm−2. This is much higher than many conventional inorganic ferroelectric oxides, such as BaTiO3 (ref. 179) and Pb[ZrXTi1−X]O3.181 The on/off current ratio was reported to be 104, and the rise and decay times were measured as 0.8 and 0.22 s, respectively. The best performances of these materials are attributed to the excellent charge separation associated with the built-in polarization. Although the polarization value of O-10 is higher than that for O-12 and the charge separation is attributed to the built-in polarization, the origin of the slow response time of the former might be due to the slow transport rate of the charge carriers. Similar to O-12, O-10 showed BPVE only in the direction of polarization. Another material, BPA2PbBr4 (H-8),132 was also demonstrated as a self-powered UV photodetector. This 2D material delivered an open circuit potential of 0.85 V, which is comparable to EA2MA2Pb3Br10 (0.98 V)122 with a 104 on/off switching ratio.

4.1.2. X-ray photodetectors. 
The field of X-ray detectors is of great interest for a range of applications, including product inspection, security, defense, medical diagnostics and scientific research.175–178 The performance of these detectors is evaluated on the basis of sensitivity and charge carrier mobility product (μτ, where μ is mobility and τ is lifetime). The higher sensitivity and μτ lead to high performance X-ray detectors. A higher value of sensitivity means the material can detect weaker X-rays. As the X-ray photons have very strong penetration capability, it generates charge carriers throughout the depth of the material. So, for efficient carrier collection, a large value of μτ per unit electric field is required. Commercial X-ray detectors typically contains α-Se,182,183 CdTe,184 and CdZnTe (CZT),185 but the cost of their fabrication is high due to the design complexity and high processing temperatures. Two new above-room-temperature 2D ferroelectric halide perovskites based on BA2EA2Pb3Br10 (O-15)124 and CPA4AgBiBr8(H-7)131 were successfully employed for X-ray detection.124 In Table 2, we have compared the sensitivity and mobility lifetime of some conventional and perovskite detectors.

Ji et al. demonstrated that O-15 single crystals have an ultrahigh sensitivity of 6800 μC Gyair−1 cm−2 under a voltage of 10 V, which made it the right candidate for X-ray detection applications. Similar to the UV photodetector, these detectors were fabricated by coating gold on two opposite sides of the crystal and then exposed to a tungsten X-ray tube to study the detection properties. This material reported a μτ product of 1 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 along the polarization direction, i.e., c-axis (Fig. 9a). This value is much greater than that of many other reported materials, such as α-Se182–184 and CdTe,184 but comparable to commercialized CdZnTe.185Fig. 9b shows the impact of the X-ray dose rate on the current density along the polarized axis under 10 V applied bias. The slope of the linear curve provides the sensitivity value, which is extraordinary compared to many other reported materials (Table 2). The lead-free 2D double perovskite halide, CPA4AgBiBr8 (H-7), also showed good performance as an X-ray detector at room temperature with a mobility-lifetime product of 1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1, which is higher than that of α-Se.131 These encouraging results made the O-15 and H-7 materials into potential candidates for next-generation room temperature X-ray detection that can operate at low voltages.

4.1.3. Polarized light detector. 
In 2019, Li et al. reported on polarization-sensitive light detectors based on the ferroelectric halide perovskite BA2MAPb2Br7 (O-8) for the first time for shortwave photodetection.119 These photodetectors were single crystal devices fabricated using the crystal wafers shown in Fig. 10a. This work revealed the photocurrent dependence on the incident power, and revealed the anisotropy in the optical behavior needed for polarized light detection. Fig. 10b and c projects the angle-resolved photocurrent as a function of the polarization angle (in polar coordinates), yielding a dichroism ratio Imax/Imin of 2 (Imax is the maximum photocurrent at 90° polarization and Imin is the minimum photocurrent at 0° polarization) and absorption ratio αc/αa (α is the absorption coefficient) of 1.9 along the c- and a-axes. The photodetectivity is the parameter that shows the ability to detect weak signals, and was calculated to be 1.1 × 109 Jones. O-8 showed a switching time of microseconds with the rise and decay times of 20 μs and 28 μs, respectively. Another ferroelectric 2D trilayered (allyammonium)2(ethylammonium)2Pb3Br10 (O-14) also showed polarized light detection.123 O-14 has a polarization ratio of 15, which is significantly higher than O-8 and is higher than the values reported for monocomponent devices based on 2D ferroelectrics. In addition, this polarization ratio sustained up to Tc = 378 K, making it the perfect choice for polarized light detection at ambient temperature.

4.2. Piezoelectric sensors
The material (4-aminotetrahydropyran)2PbBr4 (O-5) with an extremely large piezoelectric voltage coefficient (g33) was reported by Chen et al.85 in 2020. The piezoelectric coefficient (d33) for O-5 was studied using angular-resolved PFM and the value was found to be 76 pC N−1, which is higher than that reported for (CHA)2PbBr4 (O-6, 48 pC N−1).143,189 The piezoelectric voltage coefficient, which plays a crucial role in the performance of the piezoelectric sensors, is calculated using the relation g33 = d33/ε33, where ε33 is the dielectric permittivity (εr = ε33/ε0). For O-5, the εr was experimentally determined to be 13, giving a g33 value of 660.3 × 10−3 Vm N−1 at Tc of 503 K, which is much higher than that reported for the high-end piezoelectric sensor material polyvinylidene fluoride (g33 = 286.7 × 10−3 Vm N−1).190 Such high g33 with TC of 503 K suggests that this material would show excellent performance over a broad range of temperatures, making it a suitable candidate for piezoelectric sensors.
4.3. Solar cells
A perovskite solar cell absorber doped with homochiral R-1-(4-cholorophenyl) ethyl-ammonium cation was reported in 2020 by Xu et al. (Fig. 11a).160 The introduction of homochirality resulted in a very high power conversion efficiency of 21.78% due to the built-in electric field of the ferroelectric perovskite, providing better charge separation. The homochiral molecule also acted as the defect passivation layer for perovskite, reducing the electron trap-states with enhanced photoluminescence intensity. Furthermore, the photovoltaic performance is affected by the direction and time of polarization. Positive poling is shown to enhance both short-circuit current density and open-circuit potential. The role of poling in halide perovskite is very similar to the observations in the BiFeO3 thin-film photovoltaics.39 Considering the tunability and ease of fabrication of the halide perovskite devices, the synergy that the ferroelectrics and optoelectronics bring together can be exploited for highly efficient photovoltaic systems.

4.4. Light emitting devices
It is very well known that the polarization in materials helps with improving the separation of the photogenerated charge carriers and increasing the excited-state lifetime. In one of our recent works on non-ferroelectric halide double perovskites, we showed that the creation of a local dipole improves the photoluminescence emission by more than an order of magnitude compared to their symmetric analogues. This is due to the creation of self-trapped excitonic states. The local polarization led to an increase in the lifetime by almost six orders of magnitude from sub-ns to sub-ms.145 The increase in the lifetime is attributed to the trapping of carriers in the polarized domains. The permanent polarized ferroelectric materials, unlike our double perovskites, can have better tunability in polarization and their light emission properties.
In 2018, Ji et al. reported a 2D layered halide perovskite BA2PbCl4 (O-1) with broadband white light emission and high color-rendering index (CRI) of 86 under UV excitation, which is much higher than a typical fluorescent light whose CRI is ∼65. The white light emission in O-1 arises from the molecular reorientation of the organic cation and distortion in the inorganic octahedra of [PbCl6]4−. The emission in O-1 covers the entire visible region with the maxima at 543 nm (Fig. 12a). This broad emission lies in the yellow side of pure white light emission in Commission Internationale de l' Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity coordinates (0.37, 0.40) with 4423 K color temperature (Fig. 12b). This suggests that O-1 can be a potential light-emitting candidate for solid state lighting and displays. The photoluminescence quantum yield shows a moderate value of 1% with the highest excited state lifetime of 9.68 ns. In addition, to demonstrate the bright white light emission, a thin layer of O-1 was coated on a blue LED lamp (Fig. 12c). On illumination, it emits bright white light, further confirming its potential in device application. The latter demonstration is very similar to the Ce:YAG phosphors coated on blue LEDs to obtains white emission.191

Fig. 12d shows the temperature-dependent emission, where the decrease in temperature resulted in more intense and narrower emission associated with the enhanced electron–phonon coupling interaction in a distorted lattice.192–195 An upconversion green light emitter using BA2FAPb2Br7 (O-9) due to the two-photon absorption property with a large non-linear optical absorption coefficient (5.76 × 103 cm GW−1) has also been reported.120
5. Conclusions and perspectives
A good number of above-room-temperature two-dimensional ferroelectric perovskites were synthesized, and they were successfully employed in a variety of optoelectronic devices. Ferroelectricity can be introduced in these materials by tuning the chemical structure of the organic linkers. The linkers that possess a dipole moment if aligned in a given direction can lead to spontaneous polarization. Alloying organic cations in halide perovskites has shown a remarkable increase in spontaneous polarization. The halide substitution in the organic cations converted many 2D perovskites from centrosymmetric to non-centrosymmetric polar systems. The dipole contribution from the halides leads to net polarization. In particular, the highly electronegative fluorine is reported to be more effective than other halogens. Along with these two methods, the classic way of introducing polarization using polar homochiral molecules has also been explored. The polar homochiral cations between the layers of [MX6]y− octahedra sheets enabled spontaneous polarization in perovskite materials. The rigidity of the polar organic cations in 2D halide perovskite crystals decides the transition temperature. The rigid cations require a higher temperature (analogous to the glass transition temperature in polymeric materials) to randomize the directional orientation of the dipoles, resulting in the loss of net polarization. However, the role of these cations is not well explored in halide perovskites, and requires a systematic investigation to clearly define the correlation between the chemical structure and Curie temperature.
Adding ferroelectric properties to the best HOIPs has widened their application domain from light sensing and emission to piezodetectors. In all of the optoelectronic devices, the ability to effectively separate the photogenerated charge due to the built-in electric field is the single most important and unique aspect that makes them attractive. The spontaneous polarization values and the Curie temperature are on par with the well-studied oxide ferroelectrics, including BaTiO3 and BiFeO3.36,38,115 The ease of fabrication of thin films and panchromatic visible light absorption coupled with the wide choice of molecular cations to obtain good ferroelectric properties make this class of halide perovskite more attractive. Another general aspect of 2D materials is their incredible ambient stability compared to the state-of-the-art three-dimensional systems.64,196
However, there exists a generic problem of poor conductivity along the c-direction in these two-dimensional halide perovskites.197 This issue arises due to insulating organic cations that are used to tweak the stability and ferroelectric properties. However, single crystals of these materials are used in some detection applications, where the contacts can be made along the a or b direction perpendicular to the octahedra layers to ensure conductivity. Many applications including solar cells require thin films. During film fabrication, e.g., via spin coating, the crystals grow in random directions and leads to poor carrier transport.197,198 Hence, to effectively use the ferroelectric properties of these 2D materials, the efforts should be focused on the directional growth of films, where the octahedra layers should be perpendicular to the conducting substrates. Alternatively, multilayer structures with the mix of two- and three-dimensional components like O-7 to O-15 (ref. 107, 109, 110 and 119–124) show a good balance of conducting and ferroelectric properties.
Recently, there has been a strong push to move towards a green and sustainable environment. The lead cation is considered to be toxic. Hence, a potential replacement with other cations (like tin) should be investigated.108 Lead-free double perovskite two-dimensional structures, like H-5 and H-7, shall be the next-generation materials. It is worthwhile to focus efforts on tuning their ferroelectric properties by employing the wide variety of polar cations reported for lead-based materials. The recent emergence of machine learning can accelerate the identification of the right set of polar organic cations, metal site, and halides to focus the synthesis towards the best materials for optoelectronic applications.63
The built-in electric field in these materials is known to enhance the charge separation efficiency in photovoltaic devices. Apart from this unique advantage in bulk photovoltaics, the ferroelectric semiconductors show anomalous photovoltaic behavior with an above-bandgap photovoltage. In many oxide perovskites, including BiFeO3, LiNbO3 and BaTiO3, this concept has been demonstrated successfully where the voltages of several hundreds of volts have been reported.2,39,199,200 Each domain wall was shown to act as a single solar cell, and the presence of multiple domains added the achieved open-circuit potential. However, these oxide perovskites are insulators and possess negligible visible light absorption properties. Recently, a visible light-absorbing semiconductor BiFeO3 exhibited a photovoltage of 16 V (ref. 39) and ∼30 V.40,201 Although this concept is quite exciting, it has not led to high efficiency devices predominantly because oxides possess inferior optoelectronic properties, like low charge carrier conductivity and high recombination. The halide perovskites, on the other hand, are excellent optoelectronic materials that simultaneously possess ferroelectric properties. The combination of these two makes them unique for ferroelectric photovoltaics. It should be noted that in halide perovskites, the ferroelectricity is shown predominantly in two-dimensional materials. As mentioned before, these materials possess anisotropic conduction where the conductivity is higher in the a–b plane and poor along the c-direction, as the octahedra layers are isolated by non-conducting organic domains. One of the ways to get around this problem is to achieve directional growth of films on the electron/hole transport layer perpendicular to the a–b plane. Research studies shall also focus on conjugated bifunctional ligands that connect two octahedra layers to enhance the charge transfer between the layers. Yet another strategy is to employ quasi two-dimensional materials with Cs+/Rb+/K+ and ferroelectric organic cations like O-7 to O-15. The pure 2D systems show high stability; however, at the expense of conductivity along the c direction. The mixed A site systems with smaller inorganic cations can have a good balance of stability and conductivity. However, the latter is expected to possess less net spontaneous polarization compared to the pure 2D analogues. It is an intricate balance of properties between the high spontaneous polarization and stability in the 2D materials, and the conducting properties of the 3D materials. The quasi 2D will possess a good balance of both, and shall lead to better photovoltaic performance.
One other key area where the ferroelectric materials can be exploited is light emitters. They can be used directly as emitters or as phosphors along with blue LEDs.202 As these materials possess self-trapped excitonic behavior,117,120 a broad and intense white light emission with high quantum yield can be attained. Using them as phosphors does not require conducting properties. Hence, the reported materials can be utilized straight away for this application. However, to make LEDs, the synthetic methods to fabricate films with octahedra layers perpendicular to conducting substrates have to be developed.
For all of the applications, it is preferred to synthesize materials with a high Curie temperature. With higher TC, the range of operation of the device will also extend close to TC without the loss of ferroelectric properties. At temperatures close to TC, the dielectric properties vary abruptly, leading the crystal structure to change from a non-centrosymmetric to centrosymmetric system. This shall lead to a reduction of the net polarization close to TC, thereby reducing the overall charge separation efficiency. BiFeO3 is one of the most studied ferroelectric perovskites, possessing TC around 813 °C and has been reported in a number of above-room-temperature applications, including photoelectrochemistry, photovoltaics and piezoelectricity.39,46,50,203 In a halide perovskite, the role of the organic cations and TC is not clear and requires detailed investigation. The spontaneous polarization describes the total quantity of dipoles present. A larger polarization at a given temperature leads to higher charge separation efficiency. For lowering the recombination, a higher polarization is preferred. However, the localization of the photogenerated charge carriers in these polar domains shall potentially decrease the charge transport rate, thereby reducing the overall charge collection efficiency. A high polarization will compromise the carrier transport, where the low polarization might affect the recombination properties negatively. The role of polarization in charge separation and transport is an unexplored area, and we believe that a threshold value of polarization may be required to balance the good recombination and transport properties.
Overall, the above-room-temperature two-dimensional halide perovskites with built-in polarization have greater potential for a wide range of applications, including solar cells and light emitters. When coupled with polarization, the state-of-the-art conventional perovskites shall push their existing limits for high efficiency devices. Furthermore, they can provide opportunities for new applications like piezoelectric sensors that conventional non-polar materials cannot offer.
