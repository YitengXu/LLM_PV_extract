    , Accepted 29th April 2019First published on 30th April 2019AbstractA series of new type hybrid bromobismuthates formed by various pyrazinium cations were isolated and studied. In the systems initially containing iodide anions and monocations of substituted pyrazines, the complexes based on doubly charged cations of substituted pyrazines instead of ones based on the corresponding monocations were surprisingly formed. The variation of substituted pyrazinium cations affects not only the crystal structures of hybrid bromobismuthates via tuning the nuclearity of the anions but also the hydrolytic stability of the compounds. A thorough structural study of hydrolytic transformations was performed for halobismuthates for the first time. The results revealed a stepwise course of the process affording several products. Spectral studies of the complexes evidence that the values of optical band gaps (Eg) are low in comparison with those for similar systems which is most likely due to the cooperative effect involving the nature of the corresponding cations together with the features of the supramolecular structures of the complexes.
1. Introduction
Currently, hybrid complexes formed by inorganic p-halometallate anions and cations of the organic bases are being intensively studied as potential components for photovoltaic systems.1–5 In turn, among these complexes, lead derivatives are of particular interest, which is due to their high and tunable efficiency. For instance, solar cells based on methylammonium iodoplumbate, [CH3NH3][PbI3], exhibiting efficiencies up to 17.14% were reported.6–8 Replacement of the methylammonium cations with the formamidinium (FA+, [HC(NH2)2]+) ones resulted in a drastic increase in the efficiency up to more than 20% for the corresponding [HC(NH2)2][PbI3] perovskite.9 And varying both the cationic (FA+/Cs+vs. FA+) and anionic ([Pb(I1−xBrx)3]−vs. [PbI3]−) compositions allowed one to obtain tandem (with Si) solar cells exhibiting an efficiency of more than 25%.10 Such tunable efficiency is primarily due to the possibility of varying the optical band gap, Eg, in a wide range. Indeed, the mentioned parameter is reliably estimated as 1.57,6 1.48 (ref. 9) and 1.75 eV (ref. 10) for the mentioned systems.
However, practical application of photovoltaic systems containing lead halide complexes is restricted by obviously high toxicity of Pb compounds as well as by their poor stability towards hydrolysis.11 Thus, other similar systems are worth studying.
Among the most promising candidates for the replacement of lead-based compounds in photoelectrochemical cells, hybrid compounds based on bismuth halides hold a special place.12–15 These compounds are obviously less toxic than lead derivatives, and are generally more resistant to atmospheric moisture. Unfortunately, solar cells based on the currently studied Bi complexes do not yet exhibit a power conversion efficiency (PCE) which would be sufficient for their practical application. Indeed, the most efficient solar cell based on [CH3NH3]3[Bi2I9] exhibits a PCE value of 1.64% and is thus significantly inferior to the ones based on haloplumbates.14 Therefore, in an attempt to find a compound that meets the requirements and is of similar efficiency to methylammonium and formamidinium iodoplumbates,9 numerous novel halobismuthates are being synthesized and studied.
The methods for the preparation of halobismuthate complexes differ mainly in the concentration of hydrohalogenic acid involved in the synthesis. For instance, about 50 known hybrid halobismutates formed by pyridine (Py) and bipyridine (bpy) derivatives were isolated in the crystalline state from diluted (2–8 M) HBr16–25 or acidified methanolic solutions.26 Such techniques were used to obtain bromobismuthates of 2-bromopyridinium19 and methylviologen (4,4′-dimethyl-N,N′-dipiridinium)26 formed by linear [BiBr5]n2n− chains and exhibiting an optical band gap (Eg) of about 1.97–1.98 eV. A variety of alternative synthetic routes are also known, i.e. studies reporting the isolation of hybrid bromobismuthates from HBr-free aqueous solutions.27,28 These techniques, however, do not always provide crystals suitable for structural studies. Polar solvents27,29,30 as well as concentrated HBr31,32 are being commonly used for the recrystallization of these compounds. Concentrated HBr may also be applied in direct synthesis of hybrid bromobismuthates.33,34 Thus, both neutral salts and acidic salts may be obtained. The latter may in principle be isolated even from slightly acidic solutions though only one example of such a study is currently known.35
This allows one to significantly expand the range of hybrid bromobismuthates being studied, which may be structurally characterized, as well as to find out the structural features affecting the Eg value. For instance, in addition to known approaches to tuning the Eg value via varying the composition and the structure of haloanions, an alternative method is worth studying for these systems, i.e. varying the cations forming such complexes. Pyrazine (Pz) and its derivatives are close analogues of Py and thus promising candidates which have been rarely studied. In addition, it is known that these organic bases form stable mono-36 and dications.37 Consequently, they are capable of forming hybrid halobismutates, which include both these forms of cations with previously unknown values of Eg.
Herein, we report the synthesis and study of the first series of hybrid halobismuthates formed by methylpyrazinium derivatives and containing mono-, oligo- and polynuclear halobismuthate anions. The mentioned complexes were prepared from the commercially available reactants and isolated as crystalline samples suitable for single crystal XRD. In order to clarify the possibility of the application of the studied compounds as light harvesting substances in solar energetic devices, we also investigated their thermal and hydrolytic stability as well as optical properties.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials and physical methods
The following available reagents and solvents were used for syntheses: BiBr3 (99.999%, Lanhit, extra dry), Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (Reachim, Extra pure), KI (Reachim, A.C.S.), HBr (48 wt% in H2O, Sigma-Aldrich), and ethanol. Pyrazine derivatives, i.e. 1-methylpyrazinium iodide, 1,3-dimethylpyraziniumiodide, 1,2,3-trimethylpyrazinium iodide and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylpyrazinium iodide, were prepared according to ref. 36. All operations were carried out in air.
Single crystal X-ray data for 1–6, 8, and 10 were collected on a Bruker SMART APEX2 instrument.38 Absorption was taken into account by a semiempirical method based on equivalents using SADABS.39 The data for 11 were collected with a PILATUS@SNBL diffractometer at the BM01 end station of European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France.40 The temperature was controlled with a Cryo Stream 700+ nitrogen blower (Oxford Cryosystems) and set to 150 K. The synchrotron data were pre-processed with SNBL ToolBox40 and processed with CrysAlis software (Rigaku Oxford Diffraction). The structures were determined using a combination of direct methods and Fourier syntheses. The positions of C–H hydrogen atoms were calculated from geometrical considerations. The structures of 2, 3, 8, and 11 were refined by the full-matrix anisotropic least squares method. The details for the refinement of 1, 4, 5, 6, and 10 may be found in the ESI.† All the calculations were carried out using SHELXS and SHELXL software.41 Main crystallographic data and structure refinement statistics for 1–6, 8, 10, and 11 are given in Table S1.† Lengths of the Bi–Br(I) bonds are provided in Table S2.† Geometrical features of the HBs are summarized in Table S3.†
The powder X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-Ray diffractometer (CuKα, Ni-filter, LYNXEYE detector, reflection geometry). The unit cell parameters given in the ESI† were determined by the Rietveld refinement with the TOPAS software.42
The diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on an Ocean Optics QE65000 spectrophotometer in the range of 11000–50000 cm−1 at room temperature. The Kubelka–Munk function is defined in ref. 43.
The thermal behavior of the samples was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) using a SDT Q600 V8.3 Build 101 Module DSC-TGA thermal analyzer instrument. The samples were heated in an open alumina pan from 25 to 300 °C under an air atmosphere at a heating rate of 10° min−1.
All DFT calculations were performed within the PBE exchange–correlation functional using VASP 5.4.1.44–47 Atomic cores were described using PAW potentials. Valence electrons (2s and 2p for O and N atoms; 5d, 6p, and 6s for Bi; 4s and 4p for Br; 1s for H) were described in terms of a plane-wave basis set (the kinetic energy cutoff was at 900 eV). The electron density function suitable for analysis in terms of QTAIM theory was obtained in separate single-point calculations of the optimized structure of 2 using the fast Fourier transform grid that was twice as dense as the default values (the distances between points in direct space were ∼0.03 Å). Topological analysis of electron density in terms of QTAIM theory was carried out with the AIM program (a part of ABINIT code48). NCI analysis was performed using CRITIC2 software.49
The chemical composition of the compounds was analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) with a Carl Zeiss NVision 40 scanning electron microscope equipped with an Oxford Instruments X-Max (80 mm2) detector and operating at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. Results are given in Tables S4–S8 of the ESI.†
2.2. Synthetic details

2.2.1. Synthesis of [MePzH]3[BiBr6]2 (1), [Me2PzH]2[Bi2Br10]·2H2O (2), [Me3PzH][BiBr5]·H2O (3), [Me4PzH]3[BiBr6]2·H2O (4), [HPz]2[H3O][BiBr6]·H2O (5). 
Complexes 1–5 were prepared by the reaction of the corresponding methylpyrazinium iodides dissolved in a minimal amount of HBr with BiBr3 in 10–20 ml of concentrated HBr. All the complexes were isolated after slow evaporation of the resulting solution in several days and additionally washed with EtOH.
For 1, 0.444 g (2.00 mmol) of 1-methylpyrazinium iodide and 0.600 g (1.34 mmol) of BiBr3 were taken to yield 0.936 g of a product containing big brown single crystals of 1. According to the EDX, the average Bi:Br atomic ratio was 1:5.95 which differs from those for 3 random points, 1:6.35 ± 0.14 (Table S4†). Powder XRD (Fig. S1a†) evidences the presence of 15.4 mass % of a [MePz]4[H3O]2[BiBr6]2·1.5H2O (7) admixture in the prepared sample.
For 2, 0.236 g (1.00 mmol) of 1,3-dimethylpyrazinium iodide and 0.450 g (1.00 mmol) of BiBr3 were taken to yield 0.668 g (91%) of a red-orange crystalline product. The single-phase state was confirmed by powder XRD (Fig. S1b†). In addition, the average Bi:Br atomic ratio was 1:5.03 which is close to those for 3 random points, 1:5.30 ± 0.26.
For 3, 0.250 g (1.00 mmol) of 1,2,3-trimethylpyrazinium iodide and 0.450 g (1.00 mmol) of BiBr3 were taken to yield 0.646 g (86%) of an orange crystalline product. The single-phase state was confirmed by powder XRD (Fig. S1c†). In addition, according to the EDX, the average Bi:Br atomic ratio (1:4.97) is close to those for 3 random points (1:5.07 ± 0.08).
For 4, 0.264 g (1.00 mmol) of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylpyrazinium iodide and 0.300 g (0.668 mmol) of BiBr3 were taken to yield 0.543 g (89%) of a red crystalline product. The single-phase state was confirmed by powder XRD (Fig. S1d†). The average Bi:Br atomic ratio (1:5.64) is also in good agreement with those for 3 random points (1:5.88 ± 0.03).
For 5, 0.080 g (1.00 mmol) of pyrazine (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99%, Kosher) and 0.300 g (0.668 mmol) of BiBr3 were taken to yield 0.400 g (90%) of an orange crystalline product. The average Bi:Br atomic ratio (1:5.72) is also in good agreement with those for 3 random points (1:5.70 ± 0.17). While grinding the crystals for powder XRD, partial discoloration of the sample occurred, and the PXRD pattern obtained differed from the theoretical one for 5 (Fig. S1e†). We believe that such a transformation may be possibly due to the loss of the H2O molecule of crystallization or to the hydrolytic instability of 5.


2.2.2. Growing the single crystals of the products of hydrolytic transformations of 1 (6–9). 
Crystals of the following compounds were isolated during the study: [MePzH]2[MePz]2[Bi4Br18]·3H2O (6), [MePz]4[H3O]2[BiBr6]2·1.5H2O (7), [MePz]4[Bi4Br16] (8) and [MePz]11[Bi2Br9]3[Bi2Br9MePz] (9). All the crystals of the mentioned complexes were obtained as follows. A few dozen single crystals of 1 were placed in perfluorinated oil and a drop of H2O was injected. The resulting system was then carefully mixed until the emulsion of several dozen drops of aqueous solution was obtained. Several drops afforded crystals suitable for single crystal studies in less than an hour. For further details, see section 3.2. Structural investigation of 6–9 as the products of hydrolytic transformations of 1 and 10, 11.


2.2.3. Growing the single crystal of [MePz]3[Bi2Br5.16I3.84] (10). 
The solution of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (1.09 g, 2.25 mmol) and KBr (4.74 g, 39.8 mmol) in 10 ml H2O was added to the solution of 1-methylpyrazinium iodide (0.500 g, 2.25 mmol) and KBr (2.37 g, 22.9 mmol) in 10 ml of water. After several days, a dark orange crystal of 10 suitable for single crystal studies was isolated from the obtained crystalline mixture.


2.2.4. Synthesis of [MePz]3[Bi2I9](11). 
The solution of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (1.09 g, 2.25 mmol) and KI (6.61 g, 39.8 mmol) in 10 ml H2O was added to the solution of 1-methylpyrazinium iodide (0.500 g, 2.25 mmol) and KI (3.31 g, 19.9 mmol) in 10 ml of water. The obtained red finely crystalline precipitate of 11 was filtered under vacuum, washed with ethanol and dried in air. Yield: 1.016 g (73%).

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis and study of “primary” complexes 1–5, 10 and 11
A series of halobismuthates formed by the cations of pyrazinium and its different methylated derivatives was synthesized by the reactions between the solutions of corresponding halogenides and BiBr3 in aqueous HBr media. Pyrazinium cations used for the syntheses are given in Scheme 1.
 Scheme 1  The structural formulas of mono- and dications under study. 
All the iodides used herein are well soluble in concentrated HBr. Subsequent addition of the BiBr3 dissolved in concentrated HBr results in the formation of the colored solutions. Slow evaporation of these solutions in air, in turn, affords crystalline bromobismuthates formed by [MenPzH]2+ dications: 3[MePz]+ + 3H+ + 2[BiBr5]2− + 2Br− = [MePzH]3[BiBr6]2(1) 2[Me2Pz]+ + 2H+ + 2[BiBr5]2− + 2H2O = [Me2PzH]2[Bi2Br10]·2H2O(2) [Me3Pz]+ + H+ + [BiBr5]2− + H2O = [Me3PzH][BiBr5]·H2O(3) 3[Me4Pz]+ + 3H+ + 2[BiBr5]2− + 2Br− + H2O = [Me4PzH]3[BiBr6]2·H2O(4)
The absence of I− in the samples of 1–4 was confirmed by the EDX data (Tables S4–7†).
The reaction of pyrazine and BiBr3 in concentrated HBr results in the formation of [HPz]2[H3O][BiBr6]·H2O (5), which consists of single charged cations only: 2Pz + 3H+ + [BiBr5]2− + Br− + 2H2O = [HPz]2[H3O][BiBr6]·H2O(5)
The structure of 1 is formed by 1-methylpyrazinium dications, [MePzH]2+, and [BiBr6]3− anions (Fig. S2a†). One of two crystallographically independent bromobismuthate anions, Bi(1), possesses two-fold rotation axis, whereas the second one, Bi(2), possesses inversion symmetry. Cation N(1) occupies the general position, whereas N(2) is disordered around twofold axis 2. Hydrogen bonds (HBs) N–H⋯Br combine Bi(1) anions and [MePzH]2+ cations (Fig. 1 and Table S2†). The mutual position of [BiBr6]3− octahedra is close to body-centered cubic packing (Fig. S2b and S3a–c†). The matrix (110/1−10/00−1) transforms the rhombohedral cell of 1 (a = 13.368, b = 14.138, c = 19.108 Å) into the pseudocubic one (18.91, 19.99, 19.11 Å). The shortest Br⋯Br contact equals to 4.00 Å.
 Fig. 1  Fragments of the structure of 1 (thermal ellipsoids are shown at 50% probability). 
Each crystallographically independent binuclear [Bi2Br10]4− anion in the structure of 2 (Fig. 2) possesses crystallographic inversion symmetry, and [Me2PzH]2+ as well as the solvate H2O molecule occupies a general position. N–H⋯O and O–H⋯Br hydrogen bonds combine structural units into 2D-layers parallel with the (10−1) plane. The shortest Br(1)⋯Br(2′) and Br(3)⋯.Br(4′) contacts are equal to 3.73 Å and 3.80 Å, respectively, and occur within the mentioned layers (Fig. S4†).
 Fig. 2  Fragment of the structure of 2 (thermal ellipsoids are shown at 50% probability). 
The structure of compound 3 is built from infinite anionic [BiBr5]n2n− chains, cations [Me3PzH]2+ and solvate H2O molecules (Fig. 3). Neighboring Bi atoms within one chain lie in the c plane (Fig. S6†). The Bi–Br bond lengths (Table S1†) may be classified into three groups – the bridging ones (Bi–Br(5) and Bi–Br(5A), 3.029 and 3.058 Å, respectively) which are in the trans-position to monodentate bonds (Bi–Br(1) and Bi–Br(4), 2.761 and 2.718 Å, respectively) and “intermediate” ones, i.e. Bi–Br(2) and Bi–Br(3) (2.873 and 2.818 Å, respectively). N–H⋯O and O–H⋯Br HBs combine polymeric chains, [Me3PzH]2+ cations and H2O molecules into 2D-layers which are perpendicular to the a axis (Fig. S5a†). The shortest Br(1)⋯Br(1′) and Br(4)⋯Br(4′) contacts (3.757 and 3.630 Å, respectively) provide additional linkage of polymeric [BiBr5]n2n− chains into 2D-layers (Fig. S5b†).
 Fig. 3  Fragment of the structure of 3 (thermal ellipsoids are shown at 50% probability). 
The structure of complex 4 is formed by mononuclear [BiBr6]3− anions, dications of tetramethylpyrazinium, [Me4PzH]2+, and solvate H2O molecules (Fig. 4). As one can also see from Fig. 4, there are three crystallographically independent [Me4PzH]2+ cations, two independent [BiBr6]3− anions and one water molecule in the structure of the compound. Two of three mentioned cations are disordered over two positions with the ratio of 1:1 (Fig. S7a†). Hexabromobismuthate anions are located according to the densest cubic packing motif (Fig. S7b and S8†). The shortest Br⋯Br contacts exceed 4.00 Å. The cooperative effect of the N–H⋯O, N–H⋯Br and O–H⋯Br HBs results in the formation of corrugated 2D-layers (Fig. S9†).
 Fig. 4  An asymmetric unit of the structure of compound 4 (only one position of the disordered N(3) and N(5) cations is shown) with thermal ellipsoids shown at 50% probability. 
In order to study the phase composition of 1–4 as well as to catch possible admixtures, Rietveld refinement involving models of the single crystal XRD data (TOPAS software34) was performed in each case. The results obtained evidence the single-phase state of 2–4, whereas the sample of 1 contained an unknown admixture. Since brown crystals of 1 hydrolyze easily affording pale-yellow powder, and even humid breath is sufficient for that process to occur, one can assume that the unknown admixture in 1 is a product of its hydrolysis (see p. 3.2.).
The results of the structural study of 1–4 allow one to establish the effect of the number of methyl substituents in the pyrazine ring on the structure of the Bi metal core in the corresponding bromobismuthate complexes. Indeed, cations of monosubstituted pyrazine, [MePzH]2+, form compound 1 built by mononuclear [BiBr6]3− units, whereas cations of bi- and trisubstituted pyrazine, [Me2PzH]2+ and [Me3PzH]2+, form compounds 2 and 3 built by binuclear and 1D-polymeric Bi units, respectively. A further increase in the number of Me substituents has an opposite effect since compound 4 based on tetramethylated [Me4PzH]2+ is again formed by mononuclear [BiBr6]3−. However, in contrast to 1, complex 4 may be isolated as a single-phase sample. Since both 1 and 4 are formed under similar conditions and are both built by [BiBr6]3− anions, one can conclude that varying the [Me4PzH]2+ cation may serve as an effective tool not only for tuning the crystal structures of hybrid bromobismuthates but also for the stabilization of compounds formed by similar bromobismuthate cations. This is of obvious interest in further design of efficient tandem solar cells on the basis of these complexes.
It is also worth mentioning that according to the available data, compounds 1–4 represent the first known series of hybrid halometallates formed by pyrazinium dications, rather than by single-charged cations forming similar systems.50
The crystal structure of 5 is formed by [PzH+] and oxonium monocations as well as by [BiBr6]3− anions and H2O molecules of crystallization. Two crystallographically independent [PzH+], [H3O]+ and H2O molecules occupy general positions, whereas two independent anions possess inversion crystallographic symmetry (Fig. 5). As in the structure of 4, [BiBr6]3− anions are located according to the densest cubic packing motif (Fig. S10 and S11†). Shortest Br⋯Br contacts exceed 3.98 Å. O–H⋯N, O–H⋯O, O–H⋯Br and N–H⋯Br hydrogen bonds combine structural units into three interpenetrating 3D-networks (Fig. S12†).
 Fig. 5  An asymmetric unit of the structure of compound 5 (thermal ellipsoids are shown at 50% probability). 
We also performed the study of the thermal stability of 1–5. The results obtained evidence the decisive effect of the presence/absence of solvated molecules on thermal stability. Indeed, crystals of 1 collected from the 1 + 7 reaction mixture remain stable up to 150 °C (Fig. S13†). In the range of 150–190 °C, mass loss corresponding to the elimination of 1.5 HBr molecules occurs. Upon further heating, i.e. at 190–240 °C, continued elimination of HBr together with the destruction of the cationic moieties takes place. In contrast to 1, thermal decomposition of complexes 2–4 containing H2O molecules of crystallization begins at subsequently lower temperatures, i.e. in the range of 50–70 °C (Fig. S14–S17†).
3.2. Structural investigation of 6–9 as the products of hydrolytic transformations of 1 and 10, 11
In order to find out possible routes for the hydrolysis of bromobismuthates formed by methylpyrazinium-like cations, we carefully carried out the structural study of the corresponding processes for [MePzH]3[BiBr6]2 (1). All the single crystals were grown in less than an hour in the drops of an aqueous solution of 1 dispersed in the perfluorinated oil (see p. 2.2.). For 11 crystals, unit cell parameters corresponding to five new phases were determined. Two crystals of bad quality (6, 8) were fully structurally characterized. The quality of the crystals of 7 and 9 did not allow one to obtain acceptable structural data. However, in the case of 7, the ratio of the bromobismuthate anions to aromatic cations indicates the presence of the oxonium ion in the structure. Single-crystal X-ray investigation of the crystals of 7 and 9 allowed one to assume the following molecular formulae ([MePz]4[H3O]2[BiBr6]2·xH2O (x ≈ 1.5) (7) and [MePz]11[Bi2Br9]3[Bi2Br9MePz] (9)) and the unit cell parameters: I41/a, a = b = 21.03 Å, c = 21.28 Å, V = 9411 Å3 for 751 and P21, a = 24.40 Å, b = 11.27 Å, c = 24.71 Å, β = 110.3°, V = 6374 Å3 for 9.52 The investigation of one more crystal revealed only parameters of the primitive monoclinic cell: a = 12.75, b = 9.12, c = 27.35 Å, β = 90.4°, V = 3180 Å3, (310 reflexes up to θ = 10°).
Complexes [MePzH]2[MPz]2[Bi4Br18]·3H2O (6), [MePz]4[H3O]2[BiBr6]2·1.5H2O (7) and [MePz]4[Bi4Br16] (8) are primary products in the hydrolysis of 1, and the corresponding crystals were formed during the first several minutes of hydrolysis: 2[MePzH]3[BiBr6]2 + 3H2O = [MePzH]2[MPz]2[Bi4Br18]·3H2O + 2[MePz]+ + 6Br− + 4H+(6)4[MePzH]3[BiBr6]2 + (6 + 3x)H2O = 3[MePz]4[H3O]2[BiBr6]2·xH2O + 2[BiBr5]2− + 2Br− + 6H+(7) 6[MePzH]3[BiBr6]2 = 3[MePz]4[Bi4Br16] + 6 [MePz]+ + 24Br− + 18H+(8)
The results obtained also revealed that the admixture in the initial sample of 1 was compound 7 (1 – 84.6%, 7 – 15.4%). As one can see, the organic cation to Bi ratio in 6–8 ranges from 1:1 to 2:1 in comparison with 1.5:1 in the initial compound 1.
The structure of 6 is built by single and doubly charged cations, [MePz]+ and [MePzH]2+ (Fig. S18a†), tetranuclear [Bi4Br18]6− anions (Fig. S18b†) and H2O molecules of crystallization. The Br(9) atom is disordered over two positions in 0.63:0.37 ratio, whereas the [MePz]+ cation is disordered over three positions (0.39:0.37:0.24). The fully ordered methylpyrazinium dication, [MePzH]2+, occupies the volume of 80 Å3 (mercury,53 contact surface, probe radius 1.2 Å, approximate grid spacing 0.7 Å), whereas disordered [MePz]+ occupies 111 Å3. Br(1)⋯Br(5′) and Br(4)⋯Br(7′) contacts (3.835 and 3.863 Å, respectively) combine [Bi4Br18]6− into 2D-layers perpendicular with the a axis (Fig. S18c†). Cavities of these layers are occupied by fully ordered [MePzH]2+. The mentioned layers alternate with the fully disordered ones formed by [MePz]+ and H2O molecules (Fig. S19†).
The structure of 8 is formed by single-charged [MePz]+ cations and tetranuclear anions [Bi4Br16]4− the structure of which is similar to that of [α-Bi4Br16]4− described in ref. 12 (Fig. S20a†). The lengths of Bi–Br bonds (Table S2†) with terminal Br atoms are in the range of 2.682–2.177 Å, and are significantly shorter than those with bridging Br− (2.870–3.179 Å). Interanionic Br(5)⋯Br(6′) contacts (3.876 Å) combine discrete anions into 1D-chains (Fig. S20b†). If these chains are approximated as cylinders then the latter will form the densest packaging (Fig. S21†). C(1)–H⋯N(2B) hydrogen bonds (C–H 0.95, H⋯N 2.39, C⋯N 3.34 Å, 〈C–H⋯N 174°) combine N(1) cations into infinite chains (Fig. S20c†).
Needle-like crystals of [MePz]11[Bi2Br9]3[Bi2Br9MePz] (9) have formed within 1 h after the onset of the process: 12[MePz]+ + 8[BiBr5]2− = [MePz]11[Bi2Br9]3[Bi2Br9MePz] + 4Br−(9)
Since in that reaction, [MePz]+ and [BiBr5]2− which are the products of primary hydrolysis of 1 (see above) are involved, one can state that the protons accumulate in the solution during the formation of 9. Thus, simultaneously with the formation of 9, the conditions for the crystallization of the initial compound 1 appear. Indeed, dark red crystals of 1 (determined by the unit cell parameters) also formed in the same drop: 3[MePz]+ + 2[BiBr5]2− + 3H+ + 2Br− = [MePzH]3[BiBr6]2(10)
Since complexes 10 and 11 were formed in weakly acidic media similarly to 6–9, the corresponding structural comparison seems reasonable. The crystal structure of complex 10 is built from single-charged cations of methylpyrazinium, [MePz]+, and [Bi2X9]3−, X = Br− and I− (Fig. S22a†). All nine X positions are statistically occupied with the Br:I ratio ranging from 0.30:0.70 to 0.82:0.18. In the crystal structure, 2D-layers may be distinguished within which the shortest I⋯I contacts between the neighboring anions equal to 3.792 and 3.946 Å.
The crystal structure of [MePz]3[Bi2I9] (11) is more loose in comparison with that of complex 10 since a volume per formula unit equals to 845 and 929 Å3 for 10 and 11, respectively. The shortest I⋯I contact equals to 4.19 Å. C–H⋯N HBs combine the cations into a trimeric associate (Fig. S23†).
It is worth noting that there is no compound [MePz]3[Bi2Br9] isomeric with 9 among the products of hydrolysis of 1. Since both the hydrolysis of 1 affording 9 and the formation of [MePz]3[Bi2Br5.16I3.84] (10), [MePz]3[Bi2I9] (11) containing [Bi2X9]3− anions occur in weakly acidic media, one can conclude that partial or complete Br− to I− replacement favors the formation of complexes of the [MePz]3[Bi2X9] type.
3.3. Quantum chemical calculation of 1 and optical properties of 1–5
In order to find a relationship between the crystal structure of 1 and its spectral data we performed quantum chemical calculations. Since the crystal structure of 1 involves symmetry-induced disordering of methylpyrazinium cations (see above), DFT calculations were carried out for the simplified model obtained by symmetry reduction (Pbcn → P1) of the experimentally established structure. The mentioned model was additionally optimized. Atomic coordinates and total energies of optimized structure are given in the ESI.† The geometry of organic cations in the calculated structure of 1 is in good agreement with the experimental one. Concerning the latter cations, the most prominent difference between the experimental and calculated structures is related to the C–H bond value, which is ∼0.1 Å longer than the value derived from X-ray studies.
After the optimization of the atomic coordinates, densities of electronic states (DOS) for 1 were calculated (Fig. 6). Evaluation of the band gap afforded the value of 0.53 eV which corresponds to the transition from −2.2–0.4 to 0.5–1.1 eV bands. The band at −2.2 to 0.4 eV is mainly occupied by p-electrons of Br− whereas the orbitals of the cations (together with the p-orbitals of Br−) most noticeably contribute to the band at 0.5 to 1.1 eV. The energy of the next transition, i.e. between −2.2 and 0.4 and 1.8 and 2.5 eV bands, was calculated as ≈2.1 eV. The band at 1.8 to 2.5 eV is mainly formed by p-orbitals of carbon atoms of cations. Hence, the second transition may be ascribed to [BiBr6]3− → [MePzH]2+ charge transfer. In turn, the band at 2.8 to 4.0 eV is formed by p-orbitals of Bi3+ and Br−. The energy of the transition from −2.2–0.4 to 2.8–4.0 eV band was calculated as ≈3.1 eV. This transition may be ascribed to the [BiBr6]3− intraanionic charge transfer or to the charge transfer from Br to Bi and Br atoms belonging to the neighboring [BiBr6]3−.
 Fig. 6  DOS plot calculated for the structure of 1 (black line). The contributions of the Bi, Br, N and C p-electrons are marked by the red, green, blue and yellow lines, respectively. 
In order to reveal the possible channels of energy transfer in crystal packing of 1, the analysis of intermolecular interactions involving Bader's QTAIM54 and NCI55 methods was carried out for the optimized structure. Both the mentioned theoretical approaches operate electron density for discovering and describing the nature and energy of various chemical bonds and weak interatomic interactions.
For a vast majority of the interatomic interactions, bond critical points (bcp) were located. Corresponding values of energy were estimated using the Espinisa–Molllins–Lecomte (EML) correlation formula.56 The N–H⋯Br–Bi(1) bonds with an energy of 2.7 to 6.8 kcal mol−1 were shown to be the strongest interatomic interactions. Each hydrogen atom bonded to the nitrogen one participates in three bonds of that type, two of them are rather weak (2.7 to 3.2 kcal mol−1) and the third one is the strongest interaction (6.2 to 6.8 kcal mol−1). The bromine atoms from [Bi(2)Br6]3− mostly participate in C–H⋯Br, C⋯Br and N⋯Br interactions (1.3 to 3.1 kcal mol−1) which are weaker than N–H⋯Br bonds. The binding between [Bi(1)Br6]3− anions is implemented by weak Br⋯Br interactions (0.4 to 0.7 kcal mol−1).
The NCI method is a useful tool to visualize the regions where charge transfer is possible. It utilized a dimensionless reduced gradient quantity (RDG = |∇ρ(r)|/2·(3π2)1/3ρ(r)2/3, where ρ(r) is electron density). The sign of eigenvector λ2 serves for describing the nature of non-covalent interactions (attraction or repulsion). Hence we applied it for revealing the character of weak intermolecular bonds, especially H⋯Br ones, whereas the value of λ2 was applied for colorizing the isovalues of RDG. The presence of separate isosurfaces in regions of small ρ(r) values as well as its gradient is indicative of weak interatomic interactions and can be described as an analog of bcp. Areas of positive values of λ2 (more precisely, the electron density multiplied by the value of λ2) indicate interaction of van-der-Waals type responsible for stabilization of the particular atomic configuration or crystal structure. The same type is observed for cation–anion N–H⋯Br–Bi(1) interactions (Fig. 7) as well as for Br⋯Br ones (Fig. 8).
 Fig. 7  RDG isosurface (contour value is equal to 0.26) illustrating the interactions of bromine atoms within [Bi(2)Br6]3− with methylpyrazinium cations. Fuzzy regions responsible for Br⋯H interactions are specified as ellipses 1 and 2. A small oblate region specified as 3 corresponds to the N–H⋯Br–Bi(1) hydrogen bond. 
 Fig. 8  RDG isosurface (contour value is equal to 0.27) illustrating Br⋯Br interactions. Rectangular regions responsible for these interactions are specified as ellipses 1 and 2. [Bi(1)Br6]3− anions are located on the edges of the periodic box, so bromine atoms bonded to Bi(1) ones and outside the periodic box are shown. 
Based on the above described results of the calculations, one could expect the presence of three transitions in the diffuse reflectance spectrum of 1 (Fig. 9). However, the transition characterized by a band gap of 0.53 eV seems to be symmetrically forbidden and thus does not appear in the spectrum. The one with an experimental optical band gap of Eg = 1.88 eV corresponds to the transition with a calculated energy of 2.1 eV. The transition with the calculated E value of 3.1 eV is shielded by a longer-wavelength one; however it remains clearly seen for the products of hydrolysis of 1 (Fig. S24b†). The Eg values for hydrolysis products of 1–4 range as 2.82 to 2.90 eV (Fig. S24b†).
 Fig. 9  Reflectance spectra of 1 (1a), 1 + 7 (1), 2 (2), 3 (3) and 4 (4). 
Thus, charge-transfer electron transitions between [BiBr6]3− and methylpyrazinium dications are shown to be responsible for the color of 1. The existence of similar transitions may also be assumed in the case of 2–4. Besides, one might also assume a gradual increase in Eg values due to additional methyl substituents which results in an expected decrease in the electron affinity of the corresponding dications for 1–4. The latter values may be roughly evaluated from the positions of the maxima on the outer sphere charge transfer bands (Ehν) for the solutions of corresponding iodides in dichlormethane. Corresponding Ehν values are 2.67, 2.75, 2.87 and 2.94 eV for mono-, bi, tri- and tetramethyl derivatives, respectively,36 and allow one to evaluate the changes in the electron affinity of the corresponding monocations in this weakly polar solvent.57 According to ref. 36 and 57, electron affinity values decrease gradually (by 0.27 eV) in the mentioned series.
Herein, all the respective Eg values obtained from the diffuse reflection spectra are indeed higher for 2–5 and equal to 2.27, 2.32, 2.12 and 2.28 eV, respectively (Fig. 9 and S24a†). However, the sequence of change in Eg values for 1–4 does not agree with the one in electron affinity of the corresponding dications.
The absence of similar dependence in crystal substances is most likely due to the presence of a significant amount of admixture possessing different crystal structures in 1 as well as to differences in hydrogen bonding in structures of 2–4.
4. Conclusion
Thus, we isolated and studied new type hybrid bromobismuthates on the basis of various pyrazinium cations. Among these complexes, these are the first ones built by unexpectedly formed doubly charged cations of substituted pyrazines instead of the corresponding monocations. Besides, the variation of substituted pyrazinium cations was shown to be an effective tool not only for tuning the crystal structures of hybrid bromobismuthates via varying the nuclearity of the anions but also to increase the stability of the compounds formed by particular bromobismuthate cations (1vs.4). However, we also investigated somewhat “time-resolved” stepwise hydrolytic transformations of the most unstable compound 1. Namely, several products were shown to form on different stages and structurally characterized thus affording a first example of such a study of hydrolysis for hybride halobismuthates in general. The results of spectral studies of the complexes revealed comparatively narrow optical band gaps (Eg) in all the cases which are responsible for intensive color ranging from orange to red-brown. Low Eg values and their non-monotonic evolution, in turn, are most likely due to the cooperative effect involving the different electron affinity of the corresponding cations as well as structural features of the supramolecular 2D-layers containing closest interatomic contacts. In general, one can say that the approach to the synthesis of the complexes forming in strongly acidic media and involving the dications with high electron affinity was proposed herein. This approach may be of interest in further design of stable hybrid compounds exhibiting low Eg values and thus promising for photovoltaics.

 	Fig. 6  DOS plot calculated for the structure of 1 (black line). The contributions of the Bi, Br, N and C p-electrons are marked by the red, green, blue and yellow lines, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 7  RDG isosurface (contour value is equal to 0.26) illustrating the interactions of bromine atoms within [Bi(2)Br6]3− with methylpyrazinium cations. Fuzzy regions responsible for Br⋯H interactions are specified as ellipses 1 and 2. A small oblate region specified as 3 corresponds to the N–H⋯Br–Bi(1) hydrogen bond.	 

 	Fig. 8  RDG isosurface (contour value is equal to 0.27) illustrating Br⋯Br interactions. Rectangular regions responsible for these interactions are specified as ellipses 1 and 2. [Bi(1)Br6]3− anions are located on the edges of the periodic box, so bromine atoms bonded to Bi(1) ones and outside the periodic box are shown.	 

 	Fig. 9  Reflectance spectra of 1 (1a), 1 + 7 (1), 2 (2), 3 (3) and 4 (4).
