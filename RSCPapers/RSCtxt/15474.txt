    , Accepted 30th January 2018First published on 30th January 2018AbstractHierarchically ZnIn2S4 nanosheet-constructed microwire arrays (NCMAs) on a zinc substrate have been synthesized for the first time through a one-step solvothermal method without using any template or surfactant. The as-synthesized ZnIn2S4 microwires are constructed by vertical nanosheets preferentially exposing (006) facets, which are about 1–5 μm in diameters and larger than 10 μm in average length. Experimental results demonstrate that the hierarchically ZnIn2S4 NCMAs are converted from intermediate components of single crystalline indium nanowires, which are generated along the direction of (101) planes by a displacement reaction between Zn and In3+ during the initial synthesis process. This conversion of indium nanowires to hierarchically ZnIn2S4 NCMAs has been explained by a novel corrosion–exchange–self-assembly mechanism, which might indicate a novel strategy for preparing other ternary sulphide nano-microwire arrays. The prepared ZnIn2S4 NCMAs are used as photocatalysts, demonstrating effective photocatalytic degradation activity for diverse organic pollutants including different dyes, tetracycline and 2,4,6-tribromophenol (2,4,6-TBP). This efficient photocatalytic activity is ascribed to the strong absorption of ZnIn2S4 NCMAs in a wide range from ultraviolet to visible light as well as the preferentially exposed (006) facets of ZnIn2S4 nanosheets.
Introduction
One-dimensional (1D) array structures (e.g. nanowire arrays, nanotube arrays) have attracted great attention in semiconductor fabrication for the significant contribution in photocatalytic performance improvement due to their distinctive properties, including extreme light trapping, improved band gap tuning and radial charge separation.1 Binary metal oxides and sulphides such as ZnO, TiO2 and ZnS with 1D array structures have been well prepared through various strategies to improve their performance in photocatalysis, photoluminescence, photoelectrochemical water splitting and so on.2–8 Thus, the synthesis of ternary chalcogenide compounds ABmCn (A = Zn, Cd, Mg, Cu, etc. B = Al, Ga, In; C = S, Se, Te) with 1D array structures is highly desirable due to their more practical applications.9 Up to now, CuInS2 and CuInSe2 nanowire arrays have been successfully synthesized.10–14 However, the synthesis methods used before were quite complicated, and it is difficult to produce a high quality product in a large-scale using these methods. Consequently, easy fabrication of ternary chalcogenide compounds especially of AB2C4 compounds with 1D array structures remains a big challenge now.
Among typical AB2C4 ternary chalcogenide materials, ZnIn2S4 is of great importance owing to its excellent optical properties and potential application in photocatalytic hydrogen production, photocatalytic sterilization, solar cells, photodetectors, as well as photocatalytic degradation.15–20 As a result, the synthesis of ZnIn2S4 with different structures has always been highly pursued. In recent years, various structures, including flower-like microspheres, nanoribbons, nanosheets, nanowires, nanotubes and so on, have been prepared by different methods.9,21–24 Still, there are no reports on the synthesis of ZnIn2S4 1D array structures, especially nanosheet-constructed nano-microwire arrays, which can combine the advantage of 1D and 2D structures together.
In this paper, we successfully developed a one-pot solvothermal synthesis method of ZnIn2S4 NCMAs on a zinc substrate for the first time. Notably, no template or surfactant is used in our proposed method. During the synthesis process, an intermediate of indium nanowires generated initially and then acted as a self-sacrifice template for the formation of ZnIn2S4 microwires. The as-synthesized ZnIn2S4 microwires were constructed by vertical nanosheets, which could be well controlled by simply tuning the duration of the reaction time. To illustrate the transformation of indium nanowires to hierarchically ZnIn2S4 NCMAs clearly, a novel corrosion–exchange–self-assembly growth mechanism has been proposed. The illustration of the synthesis process may be generalized to prepare other ternary sulphides of 1D nano-microwire arrays. Besides, photocatalytic performance of the as-prepared ZnIn2S4 NCMAs is investigated, which demonstrates effective degradation activity for diverse organic pollutants, including different dyes, tetracycline and 2,4,6-TBP due to the strong absorption of ZnIn2S4 NCMAs and preferentially exposed (006) facets of the ZnIn2S4 nanosheets. To illustrate the photocatalytic mechanism behind, different scavengers are introduced, and it turned out that h+ and ˙O2− are the main active species in the photocatalysis process. Furthermore, the direct formation of ZnIn2S4 NCMAs on the zinc substrate shows more significant advantages compared with powder samples in practical applications.
Experimental
Materials
Zinc substrate (99.9%) was obtained from Benchley Hardware Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Indium chloride (InCl3·4H2O), thioacetamide (CH3CSNH2), acetone (CH3COCH3), absolute ethanol (C2H5OH), ethylene glycol ((CH2OH)2), methyl orange (MO, C14H14N3NaO3S), methylene blue (MB, C16H18ClN3S), tetracycline (C22H24N2O8), 2,4,6-tribromophenol (2,4,6-TBP, C6H3Br3O), isopropanol (IPA), triethanolamine (TEOA) and p-benzoquinone (PBQ) were analytical reagents. All materials were used as received without further purification. Deionized water was obtained from the water purification system in our laboratory.
Synthesis of ZnIn2S4 NCMAs
The ZnIn2S4 NCMAs were synthesized by a typical solvothermal method. Firstly, a zinc substrate (∼3 × 4 cm) was carefully polished with waterproof abrasive paper (3000 mesh). Secondly, the polished zinc substrate was ultrasonically washed with acetone, absolute ethanol and deionized water for 10 minutes, respectively. Then, 2 mmol InCl3·4H2O and 5 mmol CH3CSNH2 were dissolved in 40 mL ethylene glycol with ultrasonic treatment. Finally, the cleaned substrate and the mixture were put into a 100 ml Teflon-lined autoclave, sealed and heated at 200 °C. Following the completion of solvothermal reaction, the obtained sample was washed with deionized water several times and dried at 50 °C for 30 minutes in a vacuum for further characterization.
Characterization
The morphology of the ZnIn2S4 NCMAs was characterized via field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Carl Zeiss Ultra 55, Germany) operating at 20 kV. Transmission electron microscopy and the corresponding high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL, Japan) equipped with an X-ray energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) operating at 200 kV were used to observe the microstructures of the samples. The crystalline structure of the samples was analysed by using an X-ray diffraction spectrometer (XRD, D/max-2600PC, Japan) equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 1.54 Å) at a scanning rate of 6° min−1 (2θ from 10° to 90°). The surface composition of the samples was analysed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, AXIS UltraDLD, Japan) with a monochromatic Al Kα source (1486.6 eV). The UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Lambda 950, PerkinElmer, USA) was used to record absorption and diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of ZnIn2S4 samples and organic pollutant solution (MO, MB and tetracycline). A Liquid Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer (LCMS, Agilent, USA) was used to characterize the concentration of 2,4,6-TBP during photocatalytic degradation.
Photocatalytic degradation measurements
The photocatalytic activity of ZnIn2S4 NCMAs is evaluated by the degradation rate of diverse organic pollutants under ultraviolet–visible light irradiation, including MO, MB, tetracycline and 2,4,6-TBP. The quantity and dimension of ZnIn2S4 NCMAs grown on the zinc substrate were about 10 mg and 3 × 4 cm, respectively. The initial concentration of each dye was 5 ppm. An aqueous solution of the dye (80 ml) was transferred into a 200 ml Pyrex vessel. The blank zinc substrate (4 × 4 cm) was suspended in the middle of the solution through four copper wires with the ZnIn2S4 sample on it. It took the sample 30 min of magnetic stirring in the dark to achieve an adsorption/desorption equilibrium state. The Pyrex vessel containing the mixed solution and the sample was vertically irradiated with a 500 W xenon lamp and equipped with an AM 1.5G filter. The distance between the lamp socket and the sample was about 10 cm, and the intensity of light power was about 125 mW cm−2 at the sample position. At given irradiation time intervals, 3 ml of the mixed solution was gathered and filtered.
The UV–vis-NIR absorption spectrum was used to analyze the filtrate of organic pollutants including MO, MB and tetracycline. The intensity and position of the maximum absorption peak of the pollutants were recorded, respectively. In our experiments, the photocatalytic degradation rate is defined as A/A0, in which A is the maximum absorption peak after each irradiated time interval, and A0 is the initial maximum absorption peak. As for 2,4,6-TBP, the concentrations of each irradiated time interval were determined by using a LCMS system with a UV detector. The mobile phase was optimized as 20 vol% methanol and 80 vol% water pumped at 0.8 ml min−1. The LCMS system equipped with an Agilent C18 reverse-phase column (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) was used to measure the concentration at 30 °C. Here, A is defined as the signal peak area of 2,4,6-TBP after each irradiated time interval, and A0 is the initial signal peak area.
Active species capturing experiments
The isopropanol (IPA), triethanolamine (TEOA), and p-benzoquinone (PBQ) scavengers were added to the organic pollutant (MB) to probe hydroxyl radicals (˙OH), holes (h+) and superoxide radicals (˙O2−), respectively. The initial amounts of IPA, TEOA and PBQ were 1 mmol, 1 mmol and 0.1 mmol. Besides, the photocatalytic degradation condition was the same as that of the above photocatalytic activity measurements.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a presents the schematic illustration of the hierarchically ZnIn2S4 NCMA preparation process through a facile solvothermal method. As is shown, indium nanowires wrapped by a layer of metal sulphides were generated during the intermediate state and eventually transformed into ZnIn2S4 NCMAs. The typical SEM images of final ZnIn2S4 NCMAs grown on the zinc substrate are displayed in Fig. 1(b–d). From Fig. 1b, it can be clearly observed that ZnIn2S4 NCMAs are growing in random directions, covering the zinc substrate fully. The vertical ZnIn2S4 nanosheet-constructed microwires show about 1–5 μm diameters and larger than 10 μm average lengths. According to the magnified SEM image shown in Fig. 1d, the nanosheets grow vertically on the ZnIn2S4 microwire surface with a thickness of tens of nanometers. These vertical nanosheets, which greatly increase the surface area of ZnIn2S4 microwires, contribute a lot to enhance light harvesting and shorten the transport distance of photogenerated carriers.25 To verify the purity of the as-prepared ZnIn2S4 sample, the typical EDS spectrum is demonstrated in Fig. 1e. As the quantitative composition analysis results present, the atomic ratio of Zn:In:S is 1:2.05:4.02, which is quite identical to the standard stoichiometric ratio (1:2:4). Besides, the XRD pattern of the sample given in Fig. 1f also confirms this. All diffraction peaks (except the peaks from zinc substrate) can be indexed to the crystallographic planes of pure hexagonal ZnIn2S4 (JCPDS card no. 72-0773), which are (006), (100), (102), (110) and (202), respectively. Noticeably, no peaks of other impurities (such as ZnS, In2S3, Zn3In2S6, etc.) were detected.26

To obtain further microscopic structure information of ZnIn2S4 NCMAs, TEM characterization is also carried out. As is exhibited in Fig. 2a and b, the surfaces of ZnIn2S4 microwires are all composed of crystalline nanosheets. Fig. 2c shows the top view HRTEM image of a typical ZnIn2S4 nanosheet, in which the continuous lattice fringes (0.33 nm) and the angle (60°) are in well accordance with the (100) and (010) planes of hexagonal ZnIn2S4, reported in a previous study.27 The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 2e) also presents a typical feature of the reciprocal lattice projected along the [001] zone axis, indicating a high orientation of the ZnIn2S4 nanosheets. The side view HRTEM image is presented in Fig. 2d. The 0.41 nm lattice fringe (shown in the inset) matches well with the interplanar spacing of the (006) planes of ZnIn2S4, which also demonstrates the preferentially exposed (006) facets. Moreover, this high magnification TEM image further confirms the thickness of the as-prepared nanosheets, which is about tens of nanometres.28 Besides, element mapping results of a single nanosheet-constructed ZnIn2S4 microwire are shown in Fig. 2f–i, indicating the uniform distribution of Zn, In, and S elements through the microwire and the unique phase of the as-obtained sample.

XPS is also characterized to analyse the surface chemical state of the ZnIn2S4 sample. According to the survey XPS spectrum shown in Fig. 3a, Zn, In and S elements are all present on the surfaces of the sample. Besides, Zn 2p, In 3d, and S 2p core levels were also studied in detail, respectively. As Fig. 3b shows, the binding energies of Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 fixed at 1021.8 and 1044.7 eV are typical peaks for divalent zinc (Zn2+) in a previous report.29 In Fig. 3c, the regional spectrum of In 3d (Fig. 3c) shows a pair of symmetrical peaks with binding energies centred at 444.4 and 452.1 eV for In 3d5/2 and In 3d3/2. Noticeably, no other satellite peak is observed here, (e.g. zero valent indium), indicating a complete transformation of indium nanowires to ZnIn2S4 NCMAs. In Fig. 3d, the S 2p core splits into two obvious peaks with binding energies at 161.4 eV for S 2p3/2 and 162.5 eV for S 2p1/2, respectively. All the binding energies of the Zn 2p, In 3d, and S 2p core levels observed above are quite close to those reported, confirming that the chemical valence states of the samples are Zn2+, In3+ and S2−.

All the above analysis results indicate that ZnIn2S4 NCMAs have been successfully synthesized on the zinc substrate through the proposed one-pot solvothermal method described in the experiment. During the synthesis process without any template or surfactant, the intermediate product of indium nanowires plays an important role in the formation process of final ZnIn2S4 NCMAs. To investigate the role played by the indium nanowires in detail, a series of characterization studies were carried out to analyse the intermediate products obtained with 30 min reaction duration.
As the SEM images show in Fig. 4a and b, the intermediate products of indium nanowires with a rough surface have covered the entire substrate densely and uniformly, showing 100–400 nm average diameters and 100–300 μm lengths. The XRD pattern also confirms the generation of indium nanowires, as is shown in Fig. 4c. The peaks cantered at 2θ = 32.97, 56.59, 63.20, 67.03, and 69.11° can be indexed to the (101), (200), (103), (211) and (202) planes of tetragonal indium (JCPDS card no. 05-0642), while other peaks are from the zinc substrate. According to the top view SEM image given in Fig. 4d, the obtained indium nanowires present a core–shell structure, indicating a different component of the rough surface. The EDS spectrum results, shown in Fig. 4e, also confirm this and reveal the different compositions between the core and shell. The core of the nanowire is dominated by indium, matching well with the XRD results. By contrast, the shell part is composed of a large amount of Zn and S elements in addition to In, (Fig. S1 in the ESI†) formatting an indeterminate chemical composition. This ZnxInySz shell is non-crystallized according to the absence of XRD diffraction peaks from ZnIn2S4.

In order to further confirm this core–shell structure and investigate the crystallization of the indium nanowires, TEM analysis was further carried out. As is shown in Fig. 5a, the core–shell structure is clearly presented according to the TEM characterization of a single indium nanowire. The high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) image (Fig. 5b) demonstrates that only indium element is contained in the core of the nanowires. Meanwhile, the indium element amount of the shell is much smaller. The line scanning mapping result (Fig. S2†) also proves the distribution of the indium element. The high magnification TEM image of the edge in Fig. 5d and the regularly arranged atomic images given in the inset indicate that the indium core is single crystalline with 0.33 nm inter-planar distances, matching well with the (101) plane d-spacing of tetragonal indium. The SAED pattern in Fig. 5e verifies this tetragon single crystal structure and further indicates the (101) oriented direction. The high magnification TEM image of the ZnxInySz shell, shown in Fig. 5f, indicates a poor crystallinity. The calculated lattice spacing of 0.267 nm in the HRTEM image (inset) matches well with the (400) plane d-spacing of In2S3 (JCPDS card no. 32-0456), which is also in good agreement with the corresponding SAED pattern in Fig. 5g. The 1:1.49 atomic ratio for In:S observed from EDS spectra (Fig. S3†) approaching the standard stoichiometric ratio of In2S3 further verifies the presence of In2S3. The element mapping results of indium nanowires, shown in Fig. 5h–k, further confirm the core–shell structure, in which Zn and S are distributed homogeneously on the whole surface, while In signals concentrate in the middle region instead.

However, by prolonging the solvothermal reaction time appropriately, the core–shell structure indium nanowires would completely convert to hierarchically ZnIn2S4 NCMAs. In fact, time has a significant influence on sample morphology in the formation process of ZnIn2S4 NCMAs. To present the time influence clearly, the SEM images of samples obtained with different reaction durations are displayed in Fig. 6. The indium nanowires obtained in 45 min have a rougher surface and a larger diameter (Fig. 6b), further implying the change in the shell chemical composition. With the reaction duration prolonged to 1 h, the obtained samples present a completely different morphology (shown in Fig. 6c), indicating the conversion of indium nanowires to ZnIn2S4. When the duration of the reaction time increases to 1.5 h, the microwire surfaces start to exhibit a honeycomb structure composed of vertical nanosheets (Fig. 6d). These ZnIn2S4 nanosheets present a layered structure relevant to the atomic arrangement of hexagonal ZnIn2S4.30 As the reaction duration achieves or exceeds 2 h (Fig. 6e–i), the ZnIn2S4 nanosheets become much larger, leading to the increase of microwires in diameter and form 3D ZnIn2S4 NCMAs finally. This demonstrates a full conversion of indium nanowires, which is further confirmed by the top view SEM image of a broken ZnIn2S4 microwire obtained in 2 h of the reaction (Fig. S4†).

(c–i) SEM images of the ZnIn2S4 NCMAs obtained in different durations of the reaction time indicated (1 h, 1.5 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, and 10 h, respectively). (j) XRD patterns of the samples obtained in varied durations of the reaction time. (k) Relationship between the atomic ratio (Zn/In) of the sample and reaction time. (l) Relationship between the average diameter of the sample and reaction time. 
To better illustrate the transformation process from indium nanowires to final ZnIn2S4 NCMAs, the XRD patterns of samples obtained at different reaction durations are shown in Fig. 6j. The diffraction peaks of indium begin to weaken since the reaction duration reaches 1 h. The hexagonal ZnIn2S4 peaks appear, correspondingly, indicating the gradual oxidation of indium. Notably, no impurity peak appears during the whole conversion process, further confirming the high purity of the as-obtained ZnIn2S4. As the reaction duration goes beyond 2 hours, the phase tends to be stable. The atomic ratio (Zn/In) also becomes static (1:2), as is displayed in Fig. 6k. All the above results indicate that this whole conversion process lasts about 2 hours. Besides, the average diameter of the wires increases with the reaction time until it exceeds a threshold of 4 μm (Fig. 6l) due to the generation of vertical nanosheets on the surface and the increase of ZnIn2S4 contents.
In view of all analyses given above, a general growth mechanism is proposed here to illustrate the hierarchically ZnIn2S4 NCMA formation. In fact, the complete reaction process includes two parts: the core–shell structure formation of the indium nanowire initially (first 30 min) and the transformation of the indium nanowire into the ZnIn2S4 NCM. In this paper, we focus on the latter transformation process presented in Scheme 1a.
 Scheme 1  (a) Schematic illustration for the formation of ZnIn2S4 NCMAs from indium nanowires. (b, c) Structural model of ZnIn2S4. 
At the beginning of the reaction (first 30 min), indium nucleation generates through a displacement reaction between Zn and In3+ due to different metal activities, as eqn (1) displays. Then these indium nuclei facilitated by the roughened surface of the Zn substrate grow along the (101) direction and form the core of indium nanowires. Meanwhile, a small amount of three ions produced in the solution (In3+, Zn2+ and S2−) combine together in situ to generate the shell compounds of ZnxInySz, (eqn (2)–(4)). This is the dominated formation method of the indium nanowire shell. Noticeably, In2S3 nanoparticle adsorption also contributes to the growth of the indium nanowire shell. However, the small amount results in low diffraction intensity in XRD patterns. Thus, no diffraction peaks of In2S3 were observed (Fig. 6j). Zn + In3+ → Zn2+ + In(1) CH3CSNH2 + H2O → CH3CONH2 + H2S(2) H2S → S2− + H+(3) Zn2+ In3+ + S2− → ZnxInySz(4)
The initial process shows the formation of the indium nanowires with a core–shell structure, which can be regarded as a self-sacrifice template to form ZnIn2S4 wires. To illustrate the formation of ZnIn2S4 wires, a novel corrosion–exchange mechanism is proposed here. 30 min later, the core of indium nanowires begins to corrode through the reaction between In and H+ ions provided by the decomposition of H2S (eqn (5)). The produced In3+ ions from the corroded indium core would diffuse outward whereas Zn2+ and S2− ions in solution would diffuse inward, achieving the exchange of ions to generate the compounds (ZnxInySz) in situ of the core (eqn (4)). Eventually, the indium nanowires were completely corroded, and finally all generated ZnxInySz would convert to a stable hexagonal ZnIn2S4 with the Oswald ripening process (eqn (6)).31 This hexagonal ZnIn2S4 is made up of 3 polyhedra, including In(S)4, In(S)6 and Zn(S)4, as displayed in Scheme 1b, which is attributed to the solution coordination model (SCM) in previous reports.32,33 (The detailed information is given in the ESI.†) In + H+ → In3+ + H2(5) InxInySz → ZnIn2S4(6)
However, the NCM structure formation still has to be ascribed to further building of vertical ZnIn2S4 nanosheets in situ on the microwire surfaces. The growth procedure can be illustrated by a self-assembly growth mechanism based on the geometrical constraints of starting building blocks (each building unit formed in situ in turn), which has been confirmed by the fabrication process of some oxide semiconductor in previous reports.34,35 The produced In(S)4, In(S)6 and Zn(S)4 species combine together on microwire surfaces for initial nucleation, and subsequently form vertical nanosheets exposing (006) facets with a continuous self-assembly process due to the alternated metal and S layer structure along the [001] direction of ZnIn2S4 (Scheme 1c). Here, the geometrical constraints play a crucial role in simple array formation for the absence of surfactants. This self-assembly process, instead of the mechanical splicing process, is also confirmed by the SEM characterization of the powder sample obtained in 1.5 h of the reaction from the solution (Fig. S5†), since no single nanosheet can be found in solution.
The photocatalytic performance of the as-obtained ZnIn2S4 NCMAs was characterized by diverse pollutant degradation rates using a homemade catalytic device under a 500 W xenon lamp equipped with an AM 1.5G filter, as illustrated in Fig. 7a. A series of samples were tested to evaluate the photocatalytic activity symmetrically. As is shown in Fig. 7b, ZnIn2S4 NCMAs obtained with different reaction durations all exhibited high degradation efficiencies of MO with the zinc substrate used as a blank. Particularly, the sample obtained in 2 h of the reaction is shown to be superior to others, with the best degradation rate of 84%. This can be explained by the strong light absorption combined with the charge separation and transfer ability. The UV-Visible diffuse reflectance spectra are given in Fig. 7c. All ZnIn2S4 samples show high light harvesting ability in the range of 250 and 800 nm. The absorptance of the samples (except for 1 h) increases with the duration of the reaction time due to the longer and more complete hierarchical 3D structure of NCMs, which is also confirmed by the optical images of the ZnIn2S4 synthesized on the zinc substrate (Fig. S6†). The band gaps of ZnIn2S4 products are calculated from the onset of the absorption edges, shown in Fig. 7d. However, the best photocatalytic performance of the optimal sample (obtained in 2 h of the reaction) also results from a more stable and complete 3D structure without aggregation and flaking as other samples.

(b) Photocatalytic activity of ZnIn2S4 NCMAs obtained in different reaction durations based on the photocatalytic degradation of MO under ultraviolet–visible light irradiation. (c) UV–vis diffuse reflectance absorbance spectra of ZnIn2S4 NCMAs obtained in different durations of the reaction time. (d) Band gaps of ZnIn2S4 NCMAs determined from the (αhν)1/2versus photon-energy plots. 
Based on the above results, the optimal ZnIn2S4 NCMA samples were used to degrade other organic pollutants, including MB, tetracycline and 2,4,6-tribromophenol (2,4,6-TBP). To fully present the photocatalytic activities for diverse pollutants, the characteristic absorption peaks of MO, MB and tetracycline solutions at different photocatalytic reaction stages are illustrated in Fig. 8a–c. The absorbance at the corresponding wavelength all gradually decreases as the time increases, which reveals that the pollutants are gradually degraded. As for 2,4,6-TBP, the LCMS was applied to identify the degradation efficiency instead of UV-Vis diffuse reflectance absorbance spectra due to the coincidence between its own absorption peaks and the peaks of the degradation products. As is shown in Fig. 8d, the LCMS chromatogram area of 2,4,6-TBP solution changes at different irradiation intervals, which indicates the degradation of 2,4,6-TBP. According to the photocatalytic results and kinetics of degradation shown in Fig. 8e and f, the as-prepared ZnIn2S4 NCMAs demonstrate high photocatalytic activity for all tested pollutants, with the degradation rate higher than 80%. Among the tested pollutants, the degradation rate of MB is the highest, reaching 95% due to the preferentially exposed (006) facets of ZnIn2S4 nanosheets rich in negatively charged S2− ions (Fig. S7†).36 These S2− ions would adsorb MB molecules (cationic dyes) and accumulate photo-generated holes, and in turn lead to the hole-direct photocatalytic degradation. By introducing different scavengers during the MB degradation process, it turns out that h+ and ˙O2− are the main active species for the as-prepared ZnIn2S4 NCMAs (Fig. S8†). The degradation speed of 2,4,6-TBP is the fastest, corresponding to the largest first-order rate constant of 1.46. Noticeably, different from other pollutants, the original 2,4,6-TBP solution and the solution after adsorption–desorption equilibrium with ZnIn2S4 NCMAs in the dark both had a close chromatogram peak area of 2,4,6-TBP appearing at 6th min, implying a weak adsorption. However, the degradation rate reaches 92% with 120 min light irradiation. The reason for this needs further investigation.

(e) Photocatalytic degradation activity of ZnIn2S4 samples obtained at 2 h for different organic dyes (MO, MB, tetracycline and 2,4,6-TBP). (f) Pseudofirst-order plots corresponding to (e), where KMO, KMB, Ktetracycline and K2,4,6-TBP are the first-order rate constants of MO, MB, tetracycline and 2,4,6-TBP respectively. 
Moreover, photostability of the ZnIn2S4 catalyst is also evaluated (given in the ESI†). The photocatalytic activity of ZnIn2S4 NCMAs shows a significant decrease after recycling 5 times (Fig. S9†) as S2− would be oxidised gradually by the generated holes.37,38 These results indicate that the photostability of ZnIn2S4 is still a challenge and needs improvement.
Conclusions
In summary, hierarchically ZnIn2S4 NCMAs have been successfully synthesized for the first time on a zinc substrate by a facile solvothermal method without using any template or surfactant. During the synthesis process, an intermediate of indium nanowires is generated initially along the (101) plane direction from the displacement reaction, which plays a key role in the formation of ZnIn2S4 NCMAs. The whole conversion process of indium nanowires to hierarchically ZnIn2S4 NCMAs is illustrated by a novel corrosion–exchange–self-assembly growth mechanism. Besides, the photocatalytic activity of ZnIn2S4 NCMAs is investigated using diverse organic pollutants as degradation targets, including different dyes, tetracycline and 2,4,6-TBP, in which h+ and ˙O2− are the main active species. The excellent photocatalytic performance is ascribed to a strong light absorption of ZnIn2S4 NCMAs in a wide wavelength range (250–800 nm) and the preferentially exposed (006) facets of the ZnIn2S4 nanosheet. This work might present a novel strategy to prepare other ternary sulphides of 1D nano-microwire arrays with enhanced photocatalytic activity for further research and applications.
