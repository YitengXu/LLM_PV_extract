Herein we present a simple route to improve the efficiency of PSCs by exploiting plasmonically assisted photon recycling. With embedded gold nanorods (AuNRs) in the hole injection layer of PSCs, photon radiation from excitons is promoted via localized surface plasmons resonating at the band-edge energy of the active material, and hence photon recycling is enhanced. While this enhancement of photon recycling causes a slight increase of the open-circuit voltage as expected from previous studies, surprisingly it also provokes a substantial improvement of the short-circuit current without additional photon absorption. This exceptional improvement of the photocurrent in PSCs seems to be due to the effect of the photon recycling on extending the effective diffusion length of excitons. Together with another gain of electrical ohmic loss reduction, introducing AuNRs boosts the power conversion efficiency by ∼11.4% and ∼11.7% for devices with wide and narrow bandgap materials, respectively. Details of the experimental characterization of various devices provide evidence for the elucidation of the photon recycling effects in PSCs.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have become a promising class of solar cells among emerging photovoltaics due to favorable characteristics such as a simple fabrication procedure, lightweight module, and mechanically flexible operation.1–5 However, their structural constraint of exploiting thin (<200 nm) active layers caused by low carrier mobility (∼10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) and short exciton diffusion length (<100 nm) inevitably leads to the substandard absorption property against the solar spectrum and hence the low power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared to inorganic semiconductor solar cells.6–8 Although several approaches including the development of active materials (e.g. ternary donor/accepter) with a high internal quantum yield (i.e. high efficiencies of exciton dissociation and charge collection), bandgap arrangement designs (e.g. nonfullerene acceptors with narrow bandgaps) for high open-circuit voltage, and implementation of optical nanostructures to enhance the photon absorption have been successfully demonstrated to overcome this drawback,9–16 efforts to further improve their efficiency have to be made for the full commercialization of PSCs. Meanwhile, the concept of photon recycling, which indicates re-absorption of photons internally emitted through the radiative decay of excited carriers, has been recently paid attention to by the photovoltaic society as it can offer a pathway to achieve efficiency levels of solar cells up to the Shockley–Queisser limit.17 In the case of solar cells with a long carrier diffusion length and low non-radiative recombination rate, such as gallium arsenide (GaAs) and perovskite solar cells, it has been theoretically and experimentally validated that the photon trapping structure consisting of a highly refractive back mirror and escape angle-confined front surface can boost the internal population of excited carriers through the photon recycling, which results in the increase of the open-circuit voltage rather than the increase of the short-circuit current.17–21 Despite there being many studies on this phenomenon, the influence of photon recycling on PSCs remains unclear due to the lack of related investigations. In this regard, here we present another route to improve the efficiency of PSCs by utilizing the photon recycling effect that is reinforced with plasmonic gold nanorods (AuNRs). The band-edge resonance of localized surface plasmons of AuNRs which are embedded in the hole injection layer can augment the photoluminescence of the active material by relaxation of the non-radiative decay of excitons, thereby strengthening the photon recycling. It is found that the enhancement of photon recycling by AuNRs can raise the power conversion efficiency of PSCs mostly due to an increase of the photocurrent by virtue of their additional contribution to extending the effective diffusion length of excited carriers (i.e. excitons) and therefore better photocarrier generation properties. Details of the experimental characterization of various devices support the effectiveness of the proposed system and the underlying physics.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a schematically illustrates the experimental device of non-inverted PSCs incorporated with AuNRs that induce localized surface plasmons resonating at frequencies around the band-edge of the active material. Devices with two different bandgaps were simultaneously examined to attain high validity of this study. The wide bandgap (∼1.90 eV) device comprises glass (1 mm, substrate), indium tin oxide (ITO) (150 nm, transparent anode), poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (40 nm, hole injection layer), a polymer blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA) (150 nm, active layer), and a calcium (Ca)/aluminum (Al) bilayer (20/100 nm, opaque cathode), where randomly distributed and transversely oriented AuNRs with a diameter of 15–20 nm and a length of 40–60 nm are embedded in the PEDOT:PSS layer. The narrow bandgap (∼1.58 eV) devices include almost identical materials to the wide bandgap devices except the active material poly[4,8-bis[5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-4,6-diyl] (PTB7-Th):(6,6)-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) (100 nm) and AuNRs with a distinctive size (diameter = 15–20 nm and length = 60–80 nm). Fig. 1b exhibits the absorbance spectra of the synthesized AuNRs for P3HT:ICBA (i.e. wide bandgap) and PTB7-Th:PC71BM (i.e. narrow bandgap) devices. To adjust the energy level of the strong resonance of localized surface plasmons to the band-edge energy of the active material, AuNRs were grown up to 40–60 and 60–80 nm in length along the major axis for P3HT:ICBA and PTB7-Th:PC71BM devices, respectively (inset of Fig. 1b), by using initial seed Au particles with a diameter of ∼4 nm. As a consequence, a strong resonance peak stemming from oscillations in the direction of the major axis appeared at wavelengths of ∼750 nm for AuNRs of the P3HT:ICBA device and ∼820 nm for AuNRs of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM device, while a weak resonance peak from oscillations in the minor axis direction cropped up at wavelengths of ∼520 nm for both AuNR cases. In order to insert AuNRs into the hole injection layer, a PEDOT:PSS solution mixed with the as-synthesized AuNR solution was used during the spin-coating process, where various mixture ratios (20–33% in volume) of the AuNR solution (2 wt% in water) to the PEDOT:PSS solution (14 wt% in water) were tested. As shown in the top-view scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the representative sample of the AuNR-inserted PEDOT:PSS film prepared from the 25 vol% solution (Fig. 1c), the evidently distributed AuNRs within the PEDOT:PSS film can be identified. When comparing the photographic images of PEDOT:PSS films with and without AuNRs (insets of Fig. 1c), negligible deterioration of transparency is observed due to a tiny absorption increase by the AuNRs in the visible wavelength range (ESI, Fig. S1†).

Before finding the details of experimental results, conceptual description for the working process of the proposed PSC system is provided in Fig. 1d. Considering the well-known fact that the luminescence from excited dipoles can be enhanced by adjacent surface plasmons resonating at their emission frequencies due to the reduced non-radiative decay and efficient far-field outcoupling,22–27 the band-edge resonance of localized surface plasmons of introduced AuNRs can facilitate the radiative decay of excitons via intermediate plasmonic coupling. In conjunction with the photon trapping effect by plasmonic scattering,28 the expedited photon radiation from excitons can promote re-absorption and subsequent re-emission events (i.e. photon recycling), eventually increasing the steady-state density of excitons under consistent solar illumination. This improvement of the internal exciton density can provoke an increase in the open-circuit voltage of PSCs, albeit slightly, as other types of solar cells reported in the literature.18–20 Meanwhile, the additional decay path of plasmonic coupling (ksp) to intrinsic radiative (kr) and non-radiative (knr) decay paths unavoidably entails the reduction of the exciton lifetime (τ), which indicates that the typical diffusion length (LD) becomes smaller. However, when the effective carrier diffusion length (LD,eff) is defined as the average traveling distance before losing excited carriers through non-radiative recombination,21 the increased events of photon radiation and subsequent re-excitation after photon movement by the plasmonic coupling can extend the effective carrier diffusion length even with the degraded carrier lifetime (right schematic of Fig. 1d).21,29–31 Given that one of the critical factors limiting the photocurrent of PSCs is the inferior efficiency of exciton (i.e. excited carriers) diffusion,6 such a photon recycling effect of extending the effective diffusion length is particularly important to PSCs because the considerable augmentation of the short-circuit current can be anticipated, in contrast to the previously considered types of solar cells (e.g. GaAs and perovskite) with a sufficiently long (>1 μm) carrier diffusion length under one-sun illumination.

Fig. 2 and Table 1 show the representative current density (J)-voltage (V) curves and the corresponding photovoltaic performance parameters of the P3HT:ICBA and PTB7-Th:PC71BM devices with and without AuNRs, measured under the simulated AM1.5G standard solar spectrum (100 mW cm−2) at room temperature. To prepare the optimum devices containing AuNRs, the blended solution of AuNRs and PEDOT:PSS with a mixture ratio of 25 vol% was employed, as the maximum positive effect from AuNRs could be obtained at a higher density of AuNRs unless the quenching of excitons by AuNRs became dominating (ESI, Fig. S2†). For both devices, adding the AuNRs induced a slight increase of the open-circuit voltage (Voc), such that the Voc level changed from 828 to 836 mV for the P3HT:ICBA devices and from 780 to 782 mV for the PTB7-Th:PC71BM devices. The reduced dark current observed in the insets of Fig. 2 is consistent with this increase of the Voc level. Interestingly, substantial improvement of the short-circuit current density (Jsc) of both devices was obtained by incorporating the AuNRs (Jsc changes from 9.84 to 10.35 mA cm−2 in the P3HT:ICBA devices and from 15.09 to 16.39 mA cm−2 in the PTB7-Th:PC71BM devices). This unexpected benefit of remarkably raising the Jsc, as well as slightly increasing the Voc, because of the incorporation of AuNRs is most likely associated with the enhanced photon recycling as described earlier, for which supporting results will follow. In the meantime, it is noteworthy that the incorporation of AuNRs could also enhance the fill factor (FF) from 70.1% to 73.5% for the P3HT:ICBA devices and from 68.3% to 70.1% for the PTB7-Th:PC71BM devices. This electrical gain of the promoted FF was probably attributed to the alleviated series resistance of devices evoked by the increased effective conductivity of PEDOT:PSS because of the inserted AuNRs, as substantiated with values of series resistance (9.1 and 12.5 Ω cm2 for the P3HT:ICBA devices with and without AuNRs, respectively, 7.0 and 8.6 Ω cm2 for the PTB7-Th:PC71BM devices with and without AuNRs, respectively) calculated through a method reported previously.32

To advocate that the enhanced photon recycling by inserted AuNRs was the main factor for the increase of the Jsc, we conducted measurements of the total absorption (At = 1 − R; R: total reflection) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the various devices, as shown in Fig. 3. Here, the total reflection spectra were recorded using a commercial quantum efficiency measurement system (K3100 IQX, McScience) equipped with an integrating sphere at an incident angle of 8° using a commercial silver reflector as a 100% reflection standard. For both P3HT:ICBA and PTB7-Th:PC71BM cases, there was no meaningful difference between the At spectra of devices with and without AuNRs (Fig. 3a and b). This ignorable difference of the At spectra indicates that the optical effects of the plasmonic scattering or field confinement of AuNRs at the above-bandgap energy were not the reason for the increased photocurrent, albeit the parasitic absorption loss (i.e. absorption at the substrate, electrodes, and transport layers) included in the At spectra.33 When comparing the EQE spectra of devices with and without AuNRs, it can be recognized that the EQE levels of AuNR-embedded devices were higher than those of reference devices in a broad wavelength range (λ > ∼450 nm) for both P3HT:ICBA and PTB7-Th:PC71BM cases. This broad-band enhancement of the EQE spectra without changes of the photon absorption levels (i.e. similar efficiency of photon absorption) and device materials (i.e. similar efficiencies of hole–electron separation, carrier transport, and charge collection) implies that the crucial origin of the increased photocurrent seems to be the upgraded efficiency of exciton diffusion. As mentioned earlier, this upgraded exciton diffusion efficiency was imputed to the enhanced photon recycling by the plasmonic resonance of AuNRs at the band-edge energy. More improvement of the EQE in the PTB7-Th:PC71BM devices than in the P3HT:ICBA devices is a piece of evidence for the plasmonic band-edge resonance linked to the increased photocurrent, as the strong resonance peak of localized surface plasmons was located at a more nearby band-edge wavelength in the PTB7-Th:PC71BM case. In addition, the limited physical distance (<100 nm) of the plasmonic field can be another reason for the greater performance enhancement of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM devices with the thinner (100 nm) active layer.

The measurement results of the photoluminescence (PL) spectra and the intensity decay behavior of the active layer can serve as the rationale for the enhanced photon recycling by AuNRs. Fig. 4a and b present the PL spectra and time-resolved PL intensity of the pristine P3HT:ICBA films coated on the PEDOT:PSS layers with and without AuNRs under the 500 nm excitation light incident on the PEDOT:PSS side. As expected, the PL arising around the band-edge wavelength was augmented if AuNRs generating resonance at similar wavelengths were introduced (Fig. 4a). This intensified PL means an enhanced possibility of photon recycling. The faster decay of the PL intensity in the AuNR-embedded sample in Fig. 4b clearly signifies that the augmented PL intensity was attributed to an additional path of plasmonic coupling (ksp) and subsequent photon radiation.34–37 Although the faster PL decay can be directly translated to reduction in the exciton lifetime, the effective diffusion length of excitons can be longer at the same time throughout the intermediate plasmonic coupling, as shown in Fig. 1d earlier. The improved exciton dissociation property because of the augmented effective diffusion length of excitons in the devices with AuNRs can be experimentally identified through comparison between photocurrent density (Jph)-effective voltage (Veff) curves in Fig. 4c, where Jph and Veff are calculated by subtracting the dark current density (JD) from 1-sun current density (JL) (i.e. Jph = JL − JD) and applied voltage (Va) from the voltage at zero photocurrent density (V0) (i.e. Veff = V0 − Va), respectively.38,39 Considering that the charge collection efficiency can be evaluated from the ratio of Jph to saturated current density (Jsat) at the maximum power generation,40,41 a higher level of Jph/Jsat for the P3HT:ICBA device with AuNRs (Jph/Jsat = 9.38/10.43 = 0.90) than that without AuNRs (Jph/Jsat = 8.44/9.93 = 0.85) indicates that the introduction of the AuNRs enhanced the overall charge collection efficiency and hence the exciton dissociation efficiency of the devices with an identical layer combination (Fig. 4c). A similar result for the Jph/Jsat increase upon the addition of AuNRs to the PTB7-Th:PC71BM devices can be found in Fig. S3 of the ESI.† Meanwhile, when the below-bandgap photons of the incident solar flux to the device were intentionally blocked, it was identified that the effect of the introduced AuNRs on increasing the Jsc could be diminished. Fig. 4d and S4 in the ESI† indicate the photovoltaic performance of the P3HT:ICBA devices with and without AuNRs, measured under AM1.5G illumination spectrally confined using a bandpass filter (passband wavelengths = 400–650 nm, transmittance = ∼90%; inset of Fig. 4d). Under the confined illumination, the Jsc of the devices without AuNRs was reduced by 10.3% compared to that of the devices under unconfined illumination due to the limited transmittance level of the bandpass filter, whereas a further decrease (11.8%) in the Jsc was found for the devices with AuNRs. This discrepancy of Jsc decrease seems to be attributed to the eliminated effect of plasmonic scattering on the incident below-bandgap photons which can synergistically enhance the exciton density.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we studied plasmonically enhanced photon recycling to improve the efficiency of PSCs by implementing insertion of AuNRs into the hole injection layer. The localized surface plasmons of AuNRs resonating at the band-edge wavelengths of the active material expedited photon radiation from excitons and hence reinforced photon recycling. The enhanced photon recycling because of AuNRs augmented the Voc levels slightly as expected, and more importantly, improved the Jsc levels remarkably without the change of photon absorption. This considerable Jsc increase was uniquely observed in PSCs because the contribution of photon recycling to extending the effective diffusion length of excitons was particularly critical to devices with a very short diffusion length. With an additional benefit of reducing the electrical ohmic loss, PCEs of 6.36% and 8.98% were achieved for AuNR-embedded P3HT:ICBA and PTB7-Th:PC71BM devices, respectively, where net increase ratios of the efficiency were 11.4% and 11.7% compared to the reference devices without AuNRs. We expect that the experimental findings of this study can offer another pathway to transcend the current barrier of PSC efficiency.
Experimental
Preparation of AuNRs
The AuNRs were synthesized through a method described in previous studies.42–44 Briefly, as a first step, an ice-cold aqueous solution of sodium borohydride (NaBH4; 0.6 mL, 0.010 M) was added to an aqueous solution mixture of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB; 5 mL, 0.2 M) and hydrogen tetrachloroaurate trihydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O; 5 mL, 0.0005 M), which produced a Au seed particle solution. To grow the AuNRs from the Au seed particles, the prepared Au seed particle solution (0.15 mL) was added to another aqueous solution mixture of CTAB (50 mL, 0.2 M), silver nitrate (AgNO3; 1.5 mL for P3HT:ICBA devices and 2.5 mL for PTB7-Th:PC71BM devices, 0.0040 M), HAuCl4·3H2O (50 mL, 0.0010 M), and ascorbic acid (0.7 mL, 0.08 M). After synthesis of the AuNRs, the surplus surfactant was eliminated by centrifuging three times at 9000 rpm.
Fabrication of PSCs with AuNRs
A glass (1 mm)/ITO (150 nm) substrate (2.5 × 2.5 cm2) cleaned with acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and deionized water for 10 min each was dehydrated in an oven at 120 °C, followed by treatment with plasma cleaner (PDC-32G-2, Harrick Plasma). A prepared blended solution of the as-synthesized AuNR solution and PEDOT:PSS solution (Al4083, Clevios) with various (20–33 vol%) mixture ratios was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 45 s, and then annealed at 140 °C for 20 min. The resulting AuNR-embedded PEDOT:PSS layer has a thickness of ∼40 nm. Subsequently, a polymer blend solution of P3HT (17 mg mL−1, Rieke Metals) and ICBA (17 mg mL−1, Lumtec) dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene was spin-coated (700 rpm, 30 s) and solvent annealed in a glass Petri dish (room temperature for 2 h) and on a hot plate (150 °C for 10 min) for wide bandgap devices,45,46 and a polymer blend solution of PTB7-Th (8 mg mL−1, Lumtec) and PC71BM (12 mg mL−1, Nano-C) dissolved in a mixed solvent (chlorobenzene/1,8-diiodoctane = 97:3 by volume) was spin-coated (1000 rpm, 120 s) and dried (room temperature for 1 h) for narrow bandgap devices.47,48 As a final step, Ca (20 nm) and Al (100 nm) were sequentially deposited using a thermal evaporation system. The fabricated devices have an active area of 3 × 3 mm2.
Photovoltaic and optical characterization
The current–voltage curves were characterized using a source meter (Keithley 2400, Tektronix) and a solar simulator (K201 LAB55, McScience) under a calibrated power of 100 mW cm−2 after an AM 1.5G filter. The reflection (R) and EQE spectra of devices were recorded using a spectral measurement system (K3100 IQX, McScience) with a silver reflector as a 100% reflection standard. The PL spectra and PL decay curves were obtained on a high resolution spectrometer (F-7000, Hitachi) and a fluorescence lifetime spectrophotometer (FL 920, Edinburgh Instruments), respectively.
