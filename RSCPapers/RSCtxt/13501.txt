    , Accepted 28th June 2015First published on 1st July 2015AbstractIn addition to their use as colorants in food and cosmetics, various natural dyes possess photophysical properties that could enable their use as modular building blocks for preparing eco-friendly and non-toxic chromophores. Among the natural pigments, guaiazulene holds great potential due to its unique optical and electronic properties. Thus, in order to explore and understand the properties of guaiazulene-containing chromophores, a series of 4-styrylguaiazulenes 3a–l were prepared by condensation of the C-4 methyl group of naturally-occurring guaiazulene 1 with various aromatic carboxaldehydes 2a–l. Treatment of these analogs 3a–l with a strong acid protonates the electron-rich C-3 position and reveals a reversible halochromic behavior where the optical energy gap responds predictably to the electron-donor strength and the degree of π-conjugation. Additionally, acid-doping is accompanied by efficient fluorescence switch-on, where 3e(H+) and 3g(H+) exhibited considerably higher fluorescence quantum yields than the neutral precursor. These properties facilitated the design of a new non-erasable 3D fluorescence readout (permanent or write-once read-many, WORM) system, which is comprised of a switch-on fluorescent guaiazulene-containing chromophore 3e and a commercially available iodonium photo-acid generator (PAG) in thin polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) films.
Introduction
The commercial success of numerous medicines relies on key intermediates that are isolated directly from natural sources.1,2 This strategy has been employed extensively by the pharmaceutical industry, which utilizes the preexisting bioactivity of natural products to enhance or add specificity to drugs and cosmetics through chemical modification. In fact, it is estimated that 40% of all medicines are natural extracts or semi-synthetic derivatives of naturally derived intermediates.3–5 Similarly, the physical, electronic, and optical properties of some natural pigments could offer access to key building blocks for developing bio-derived chromophoric materials.6–8 Additionally, the non-toxic nature and the accompanying eco-friendly feature of natural dyes could set the stage for chemists to develop “green” routes towards photonic and conductive materials.3,8
Among the known natural pigments,6–8 guaiazulene has gained recent popularity because of its interesting physical and electronic properties.9–17 As a nontoxic natural product found in the oils of Guajacum officinale and Matricaria chamomilla, as well as in the vibrant-blue mushroom Lactarius indigo, guaiazulene has been approved by the FDA as a cosmetic color additive.9–16 Chemically, guaiazulene is a nonalternant hydrocarbon that is notable for its low transition energy to the S1 state and an unusually large S1–S2 gap,17–27 where S1 and S2 refer to the first and second electronically excited states, respectively. As a result of its high electron density at the C-3 position, guaiazulene can readily participate in electrophilic aromatic substitution. In fact, treatment of guaiazulene with strong acids leads to protonation at the C-3 position and the formation of the resonance-stabilized 6-π-electron tropylium cation.17–27
It was shown that extending the conjugation through the seven-membered ring of the parent azulene with aromatic substituents dramatically impacts the optical, electrochemical, and electrochromic properties of the azulenylium carbocation.28–33 This reversible behavior has led to the use of azulenes as modular building blocks for the construction of conducting polymers,6 as cathode modification layers in bulk-heterojunction solar cells,26 and in electrochromic and nonlinear optical materials.20–22
In this work, we describe the use of guaiazulene in the design of a non-erasable 3D fluorescence readout (permanent or write-once read-many, WORM) system, which is comprised of a switch-on fluorescent guaiazulene-containing chromophore and a commercially available iodonium photoacid generator (PAG) in thin polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) films. This system relies on the fluorescence of a conjugation-stabilized tropylium cation generated upon photolysis of the iodonium salt. The choice of the guaiazulene-based π-conjugated chromophore was based on a study of a series of 4-styrylguaiazulenes 3a–l, whose optical band-gaps respond predictably to the strength of the electron-donor and the level of π-conjugation, showing a moderate to dramatic bathochromic shift of the main absorption band relative to their neutral forms. Interestingly, fluorescence was efficiently switched on in several derivatives, with 3e(H+) and 3g(H+) having unusually high fluorescence quantum yields.
4-Styrylguaiazulenes 3a–l were prepared following an optimized condensation between the C-4 methyl group of guaiazulene and common aromatic aldehydes. The reactivity of the C-4 methyl group can be explained by the structural and electronic properties of guaiazulene. In particular, hyperconjugation that is triggered by the electron-poor nature of the 7-membered ring allows the acidic C-4 methyl group to readily undergo condensation with aldehydes under basic conditions (Scheme 1).33 While this reaction has been documented previously,34 failure to reproduce the reported 4-styrylazulenes under the established procedure prompted us to investigate the possible condensation conditions that include the nature of the base used, the number of aldehyde equivalents, solvent, and temperature (Table 1).

The use of excess benzaldehyde 2a (3 equiv.) in a boiling THF solution of tBuOK and morpholine generates the corresponding 4-styrylguaiazulene 3a (method E) in moderate yield. On the other hand, fewer side products and better yields were obtained when a solution of guaiazulene 1 in t-amyl alcohol was added dropwise to a hot solution of benzaldehyde 2a (3 equiv.) and tBuOK in t-amyl alcohol (method F). It is noteworthy that in the case of low-melting aldehydes, careful addition of tBuOK to a molten guaiazulene/aldehyde mixture produced 3a in good yield under neat conditions; however, employing these conditions requires the use of a large excess of 2a that serves to completely dissolve 1 (method G).
NMR studies were carried out to determine the protonation site on 4-styrylguaiazulenes. The 1H NMR spectra of 3i and 3i(H+) show that protonation occurred exclusively at the C-3 position as indicated by the singlet peak corresponding to the C-1 Me-group and the presence of a broad peak that corresponds to the allylic protons at C-3 (Fig. 1). Interestingly, all proton peaks corresponding to 3i(H+) are at a higher frequency than 3i, thus indicating increased deshielding as a result of the resonance-stabilized tropylium cation (Fig. 1).

Examination of the UV-vis spectra of 3a–l in their neutral states (in DCM) shows that all derivatives exhibit a broad profile with the onset of absorption ranging between 405 nm for 3a and 472 nm for 3f that corresponds to the S0–S2 transition (Fig. 2). In addition, all spectral profiles are distinguished by broad absorptions centered at ∼650 nm that are correlated with the weak S0–S1 transition common in various azulene derivatives.
 Fig. 2  Absorption spectra of (a) 3b (b) 3c and (c) 3l at 8.0 × 10−5 M upon titration with a solution of TFA in DCM. 
The effect of acid on the absorption of 4-styrylguaiazulenes 3a–l was investigated employing either a solution of 10% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in DCM or photoexcitation of a solution of 4-styrylguaiazulene 3 and diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate (DPIHFP), a commercially available photoacid generator (PAG), in DCM. In all cases a bathochromic shift in the main absorption band relative to the original π–π* transition revealed a dependence on the extent of conjugation of the guaiazulenium cation with the adjacent aromatic rings. For instance, for guaiazulenium cation 3a(H+), bearing a styryl group, a sharp peak at λmax = 445 nm was observed, while an increasingly dramatic impact on the absorption maxima was noted for guaiazulenium cations having p-(phenylethynyl)styryl 3g(H+) (λmax = 490 nm), fluorenylvinyl 3e(H+) (λmax = 529 nm), and pyrenylvinyl 3f(H+) (λmax = 599 nm) moieties.
Furthermore, a comparison of the λmax of guaiazulenium cations 3a–d(H+) (445, 450, 500, and 523 nm, respectively) indicated that the strength of the electron-donating group has a notable impact on the absorption maxima. A similar trend can be seen in the case of guaiazulenium cations conjugated to 5-membered ring heterocycles 3h–j(H+). The absorption maxima of 3j–l(H+) were comparable, suggesting that the extent of conjugation of nitrogen-containing heterocyclic guaiazulenium cations has little impact on λmax. These observations indicate that narrowing of the optical band-gap upon treatment of 3 with strong acids can be systematically tuned by the nature of the substituent conjugated to the seven-membered ring of the parent guaiazulene.
Similar to guaiazulene 1, all synthesized 4-styrylguaiazulenes 3a–l exhibit an extremely weak S1–S0 emission in DCM. On the other hand, fluorescence is switched-on to varying extents upon dissolving 3a–l in a solution of DCM:TFA (v:v, 9:1). The structureless emission spectra of 3a–l(H+) suggest that the long-wavelength emission may result from an internal charge transfer (ICT) state.35 Interestingly, emission maxima are also consistent with previous observations drawn from the absorption profiles, in that enhanced conjugation and increasing strength of the electron-donor group of aromatic substituents results in a longer wavelength S1–S0 emission (Table 2). It was observed that all 4-styrylguaiazulenes had considerably large Stokes shifts; however, the calculated Stokes shift for 3d(H+) (181 nm) is surprisingly larger than those determined for the series (3a–c(H+)).

It is noteworthy that derivatives bearing aromatic substituents of expanded conjugation 3e–g(H+) similarly show large Stokes shifts, reflecting more electronic reorganization of 3d–g(H+) upon photoexcitation. The fluorescence quantum yields (ΦF) measured for 3a–d(H+) show a steady increase in radiative decay upon photoexcitation with increasing donor strength (Table 2). On the other hand, guaiazulenium cations 3e(H+) and 3g(H+) have exceptionally high fluorescence quantum efficiencies, apparently as a result of increased conjugation and rigidity. Fluorescence switching-on was also observed in the case of 3h(H+) with a ΦF of 0.19, but was negligible for 3i(H+) likely as a direct consequence of significant spin–orbit coupling induced by the thienyl sulfur.
The study of UV-vis spectral changes as a function of TFA concentration was carried out using two closely related 4-styrylguaiazulenes 3b and c. In both cases, the addition of TFA results in a gradual increase in intensities of new peaks corresponding to the protonated species along with bleaching of the π–π* transition peaks in the UV-region. In addition, both 4-styrylguaiazulene analogs 3b and c display an isosbestic point at 380 and 425 nm, respectively, as a result of two interconverting optically distinct species. It is notable that the equivalence of TFA necessary to induce complete acid saturation varies between the two derivatives; however, a trend related to different electron donor strengths was not established, as seen in the case of titration of 3l (Fig. 3c). In a similar fashion, fluorescence spectral changes as a result of incremental TFA concentration were studied by employing 3e that exhibits significant switch-on fluorescence (Fig. 3). As predicted, the intensity of the emission band at 656 nm responded proportionally to TFA titration, where 1500 molar equivalents of TFA were necessary to achieve a 60-fold increase in the emission band at 8.0 × 10−6 M of 3e.
 Fig. 3  (a) Absorption spectra of 3e (8.0 × 10−5 M) (b) and emission spectra of 3e (8.0 × 10−6 M) upon titration with a solution of TFA in DCM. 
A similar halochromic behavior was observed when an equimolar solution of 3e and a commercially available onium PAG, DPIHFP, was irradiated at 405 nm, where absorption spectra were recorded at 1 minute intervals (Fig. 4a). While DPIHFP is activated at wavelengths below 300 nm, photoexcitation is also achieved at 405 nm presumably through intermolecular photoinduced electron transfer (PeT), which is reported to occur from the S2 state of guaiazulene to the excited state of various electron acceptors.22,36,37
 Fig. 4  Absorption spectra of 3e (8.0 × 10−5 M) in the presence of (a) 1 equiv. and (b) 2 equiv. of DPIHFP in DCM (1 min interval, average irradiance = 24.3 mW cm−2 at 405 nm). 
Sensitization of UV-activated DPIHFP with 3e was evident as the band at λmax = 532–537 nm, associated with 3e(H+) in the UV-Vis profile, gradually emerged with a concomitant decrease in intensity of the 365 nm peak. In a solution of 2:1 DPIHFP/3e (Fig. 4b), complete conversion to the protonated species 3e(H+) was achieved in a shorter time period, while a further increase in the concentration of DPIHFP had little effect on peak intensities and irradiation time that is necessary for complete protonation.
These results enabled the design of a photosensitive polymeric system with potential applications in the field of 3D optical data storage. Films were prepared by spin-coating a DCM solution of 3e as an acid-sensitive fluorescence switch-on dye/PAG sensitizer, DPIHFP as a photoacid generator, and PMMA as a matrix. The thin film samples were then irradiated using custom printed transparent masks as well as a copper TEM grid. The output of a 405 nm-laser was briefly used to excite the film samples placed under the appropriate masks. Bright field images were then collected after the removal of the masks by using an Olympus IX-81 microscope with a TRITC filter cube to capture the fluorescence emitted by 3e(H+).
Control images, taken for sections of the film that did not undergo 405 nm excitation, showed only autofluorescence or a negligible signal. On the other hand, fluorescence images of one-photon irradiated masked samples were taken under 100× magnification, revealing grid sizes of approximately 100 μm from one corner of a square grid to the other (Fig. 5a). For the mask used in Fig. 5b (a compilation of four images), capture of a detailed smaller image was limited by the quality of the mask. The excellent contrast seen in these images, from such short exposure times, prompted two-photon excitation (2PE) lithography with these films.

[Images taken using a custom TRITC filter cube (Ex: 525/40; DM: 555; Em: 624/40 – scale bar 100 μm)]. Spin-coated films are prepared from a solution of 3e, 2% (w/w); DPIHFP, 6%; PMMA, 92% in DCM (5 mL). 
The corresponding samples were examined under a Leica SP5 confocal microscope with a 63× (1.20 numerical aperture) water immersion objective coupled to a femtosecond laser system with 800 nm excitation wavelength. Point excitation of the film was performed by setting the microscope at the maximum optical zoom allowed and irradiating for a period of 5 s followed by moving in the z-direction to another area below the first plane and exciting for the same time interval. The image was then retaken using 1× zoom at 561 nm, collected from 570 to 650 nm, and scanned using 0.15 μm steps (along the z-axis). Collected images as a result of 2PE can be seen in Fig. 6. Scanned voxels show an average size of 5 × 6 μm in the xy-plane, with an example shown in Fig. 6a. Fig. 6b shows a 3D rendering of a single voxel where the height along the z-direction could be measured to be approximately 16 μm. Fig. 6c depicts a 3D image corresponding to Fig. 6a with a side view along the z-axis clearly showing the distinct region of no fluorescence that lies in between the two voxels. We then studied the effect of radiation power and interval, in which two different irradiation powers (1.6 and 0.7 mW) and times (5.0 and 0.5 s) were used to create the voxels. Fig. 7a–d depicts the sectional view of the captured images. As expected, higher power and a longer exposure time led to a greater depth of the voxel along the z-axis (18–20 μm).38 On the other hand, low power irradiation with a short exposure time resulted in a depth of ∼9 μm. The rectangular to cuboidal shape of the voxels can be attributed to the faster scanning mode of the microscope, which translates into the voxels being created with a false point scanning method despite applying the maximum optical zoom.39 This mainly affected the y-axis of the voxel with an average length of ∼5 μm to ∼2 μm. The results, however, indicate that if a true point scan was applied, the spatial resolution could be greatly enhanced by controlling the power and the speed of irradiation.

In conclusion, a naturally-occurring guaiazulene has been used as a building block to prepare an introductory set (3a–l) of 12 guaiazulene-terminated π-conjugated analogs for which photophysical structure–property trends were established under neutral and acidic conditions. Experiments indicate a linear dependence of photophysical behavior on the nature of the donor moiety, and demonstrate how the extent of π-conjugation results in tunable optical energy gaps for the described guaiazulenium derivatives. In addition, the fluorescence switching-on of these analogs in response to protonation via a commercial PAG was considered for the design of a photosensitive polymeric system with potential applications in the field of 3D optical data storage. The corresponding images clearly demonstrate the ability of 3 to be applied in 2PE fluorescence lithography with its high fluorescence signal after very short irradiation times, and in applications in which a predictable modulation of optical properties is desired. Efforts to further probe the efficiency of the prepared guaiazulene derivatives as eco-friendly lithographic materials are on-going in our lab.
Experimental
General information
Reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification unless otherwise specified. THF was degassed in a 4 L drum and passed through two sequential purification columns (activated alumina) under a positive nitrogen atmosphere. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on SiO2-60 F254 aluminum plates with visualization by UV light or TFA staining. Flash column chromatography was performed using a CombiFlash Rf 200 instrument. Melting points (mp) were determined on Fisher Scientific melting point apparatus. 400 (100) MHz 1H (13C) NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance III 400 spectrometer. 500 (125) MHz 1H (13C) NMR were recorded on a Varian VNMRS 500 spectrometer. Chemical shifts (δ) are reported in parts per million (ppm) relative to TMS and referenced to the residual protonated solvent (CDCl3: δH 7.26 ppm, δC 77.23 ppm; DMSO-d6: δH 2.50 ppm, δC 39.50 ppm). Abbreviations used are s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), quin (quintet), hp (heptet), b (broad), and m (multiplet). ESI-TOF-MS spectra were recorded on an Agilent 6210 TOF spectrometer. Linear photophysical parameters were determined at room temperature in spectroscopic grade DCM. The steady-state one-photon absorption spectra were obtained on a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Agilent 8453), using regular quartz cells with 1 cm path length and molecular concentrations as reported. The steady-state fluorescence was measured on a FLS980 spectrofluorimeter (Edinburg Instruments Ltd), using spectrofluorimetric quartz cells with 1 cm path length and low concentration solutions (C ≈ 8 × 10−6 M). Fluorescence quantum yields (ΦF) were determined by a standard method40 relative to 9,10-diphenylanthracene (DPA) in cyclohexane, rhodamine 6G (Rh6G) in ethanol, or crystal violet (CV) in methanol.
One- and two-photon microscopy of film samples
Film samples were initially irradiated with a 405 nm laser through a custom printed clear transparent mask or a 200 mesh copper TEM grid. Bright field one-photon images were then taken using an Olympus IX-81 microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu EM-CCD C9100 digital camera using a TRITC filter cube (Ex: 525/40; DM: 555; Em: 624/40) and a 10× (Olympus UplanFLN 10×, N.A. = 0.30) objective. One- and two-photon microscope images were all recorded using a Leica TCS SP5 II laser-scanning confocal microscope system with a 63× objective (HCX Pl APO CS 63.0 × 1.20 WATER UV) coupled to a tunable Coherent Chameleon Vision S (80 MHz, mode-locked, 75 fs pulse width, tuned to 800 nm) laser. Irradiation times of up to ten seconds were used for confocal one-photon imaging performed by exciting the film sample at 561 nm and collecting images between 570 and 620 nm. The captured images were then 3D rendered by using Olympus Slidebook V5.0. Laser power was measured from the output of the beam from the objective.
Syntheses of 4-styrylguaiazulenes 3a–l
Method E: a solution of guaiazulene 1 (1.0 mmol) in anhyd. THF (5 mL) was added dropwise to a hot solution of 2 (3.0 mmol), morpholine (1.0 mmol), and tBuOK (3.0 mmol) in anhyd. THF (5 mL). The mixture was heated until most of the starting material was consumed (0.2–1.0 h). The mixture was cooled to room temperature and poured into dilute HCl (1 N), then extracted with EtOAc (2 × 25 mL). The fractions were dried over Na2SO4 and evaporated under reduced pressure. Flash column chromatography using hexanes and EtOAc (0 → 5%) afforded the desired product as a green solid. In method F, a hot solution of tBuOK (3.0 mmol) in t-amyl alcohol (10 mL) was heated at 105 °C for 30 min. To this solution was added 2 (3.0 mmol) followed by the dropwise addition of a solution of guaiazulene 1 (1.0 mmol) in t-amyl alcohol (5 mL). The solution was heated for 3 h at 105 °C, then cooled to room temperature and poured into dilute HCl (1 N). The mixture was extracted with DCM (2 × 25 mL) and worked up as above. As to method G, 10.0 mmol aldehydes 2a–c, 2g or 2h and guaiazulene 1 (1.0 mmol) were heated to 80 °C in a sand bath followed by the addition of tBuOK (3.0 mmol) in small portions. The slurry was heated for 10 min and then cooled to room temperature. The obtained greenish solid was dissolved with hexanes (30 mL) and filtered through a short silica pad.
