    , Accepted 12th May 2017First published on 12th May 2017AbstractThis study introduces a new type of system for the conversion of heat into electric power that does not require a temperature difference. This system does not rely on the Seebeck effect, and it has a simple layer-by-layer design. It is a sensitized thermal cell based on a dye-sensitized solar cell. This cell uses phonons, which are quantum expressions of heat, instead of photons. The open voltage and short-circuit current of the prototype cell, which is composed of β-FeSi2 as a semiconductor material and a solid copper ion conductor, were confirmed above 300 °C. The acquisition voltage was increased for 5 hours and continuously maintained at this value for at least 35 h, which suggests that this system functioned successfully. These generators enable all semiconductor materials to be applied three-dimensionally as heat sources, for example, in geothermal power plants, by burying the generator in a geothermal source.

Conceptual insights
In this manuscript, we firstly suggest a new thermal-to-electrical energy conversion system that does not rely on the Seebeck effect, does not require a temperature difference, and requires only a heat source; moreover, the system has a simple layer-by-layer structure. The main concept is the mimicry of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs); thus it has been termed a “sensitized thermal” cell. This cell uses phonons, a quantum expression of heat, instead of photons. Although it appears to be contrary to the second law of thermodynamics, it is not. The total reaction of this sensitized thermal cell is a type of endothermic reaction.

Introduction
In 1821, Thomas Seebeck discovered that a temperature difference between two dissimilar electrical conductors or semiconductors produced a voltage difference between the two substances, which is referred to as the Seebeck effect.1 This effect is the basis for current stable thermoelectric generators and is typically applied in gas sensing,2 coolers3 and wristwatches,4 and is the driving power for satellites.5 Several thermoelectric materials have been suggested in prior research to be producing the Seebeck effect, including tellurides,6,7 silicides,8 oxides,9 organic materials10 such as graphene,11 and nanostructures.12,13
However, because the Seebeck effect requires a temperature difference, one side of the generator must be maintained as the cooling section. Thus, in some cases, additional work, such as cooling circulation, must be provided, and the thermoelectric generator becomes a large-scale and complex module.7 The difference in the thermal expansion volume between high and low temperatures also becomes a problem. Here, a new energy conversion system that is free from temperature difference problems and that requires only a heat source is discussed; moreover, the system has a simple structure. The main concept of this system mimics dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).
In DSSCs, the function of light absorption is separated from charge carrier transport. In the case of n-type materials, current is generated when a photon absorbed by a dye molecule gives rise to electron injection into the conduction band of the semiconductor.6 To complete the circuit, the dye is regenerated by electron transfer from a redox species in the electrolyte, which is then reduced at the counter electrode.14–17 As a result, the maximum electron voltage is the difference between the Fermi level of the n-type semiconductor and the redox potential of the redox species. If “thermally” excited electrons in the semiconductor can cause an ion redox reaction, a novel conversion system of heat into electric power that functions without a temperature difference (Fig. 1), called a “sensitized thermal cell”, can be obtained.
 Fig. 1  Schematic representation of the sensitized thermal cell, indicating the electron energy level in different phases. The observed cell voltage at high temperatures corresponds to the potential difference, ΔV, between the Fermi level of the semiconductor material at high temperatures and the electrochemical potential of the solid electrolyte. The latter is equal to the Nernst potential of the redox couple (Cu2+/Cu+ in this case) and is used to mediate the charge transfer between the electrodes. 
This system can generate electric power directly from a heat source, and although it appears to be contrary to the second law of thermodynamics, it is not. The total reaction of this sensitized thermal cell is a type of endothermic reaction. It had been reported that thermally excited holes in a photocatalytic semiconductor, such as titanium dioxide, have oxidation ability.18 If it can be proven that thermally excited electrons can transfer to a counter electrode and can reduce electrolyte ions, then this sensitized thermal cell should work; or, the ions reduced by the photon-excited electrons can diffuse, while the ions reduced by the thermally excited electrons cannot. The latter indicates that “electrons can have history” and never occurs. From this point of view, this study investigates chemical reduction by thermally excited electrons, i.e., a chemical battery of thermally excited charge carriers.
Results and discussion
Our concept can fit all semiconductors that can generate thermally excited electrons. The important point is the number of thermally excited electrons. Generally, thermoelectric materials tend to generate large numbers of thermally excited electrons. Thus, in this preliminary work, we selected a thermoelectric material, β-FeSi2, which is an easily fabricated and rare earth-free thermoelectric material. A black compact of β-FeSi2 was successfully fabricated from commercially available α-Fe2Si5 powder using a compression moulding press and a spark plasma sintering process (Fig. S1a, ESI†). The temperature dependence of the electron resistivity in the compact sample was measured using the four-terminal method on a hot plate. Although a small portion of α-FeSi2 and the oxidized Si remained in the β-FeSi2, the electron resistivity decreased at temperatures above 200 °C (Fig. S1, ESI†).

n-Si, which is frequently combined with β-FeSi2 in studies on light-emitting applications, was selected as the electron transport material to receive the excited electrons in β-FeSi2.19 The bottom potential of the conduction band was 0.41 eV more negative than that of β-FeSi2.20 The samples were set on a hot plate, and we analysed the electric current generation from the increase in temperature by applying the resting potential at room temperature.
Let us begin with the n-Si system. The resting potential at room temperature was −0.014 V. This resting potential reflected the electric connection difference at the two terminals. The electric potential was maintained at this resting potential using an automatic polarization system during the measurement. By increasing the temperature, the thermally excited electrons from the donor potential (0.24 eV lower than that of the conduction band) were first observed as a positive current above 100 °C (Fig. 2a).
 Fig. 2  Temperature dependence of the thermally stimulated current of (a) n-Si and (b) n-Si/β-FeSi2. 
Next, let us discuss n-Si/β-FeSi2. The resting potential was −0.099 V at room temperature. As described above, thermally excited electrons from the donor potential were generated above 100 °C. The excited electrons may be transferred directly to the conductive paste or to the valence band of β-FeSi2 (Fig. 2b), resulting in a positive current below 200 °C. Above 200 °C, the number of thermally excited electrons in the thermoelectric material, β-FeSi2, became larger than that of n-Si, which resulted in a decrease in the positive current (Fig. 2b).
As the temperature increased further, larger numbers of electrons were thermally excited. The number of excited electrons, Ni, of n-Si and β-FeSi2 can be calculated as:21  Here, Nv and Nc are the effective density of states of the valence band and the conduction band, respectively, Eg is the bandgap, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and me* and mh* are the electron and hole effective masses, respectively. From this equation, the excited electron numbers at 600 °C for n-Si and β-FeSi2 are 1.3 × 1016 and 6.9 × 1017 cm−3, respectively, i.e., 53 times larger than that in β-FeSi2. This calculation and the above experimental results proved that n-Si can be used as an electron transport material in our system.
Energy band matching between the valence band of a semiconductor and the redox potential of an ionic electrolyte is crucial to creating a sensitized thermal cell; however, the energy band level at high temperatures has rarely been reported. According to the calculated Fermi–Dirac distribution,22 the average number of electrons with energy exceeding 0.2 eV from the Fermi level is only approximately 20%, even at 1000 K. Thus, energy band levels at room temperature were used for this preliminary work. The evaluated top potential of the valence band and bottom potential of the conduction band of β-FeSi2 were approximately +0.15 and −0.65 V, respectively, versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), i.e., a band gap of 0.80 eV.23
As a metal ion pair, the redox potential should be more negative than the top level of the valence band of β-FeSi2; thus, the Cu1+/Cu2+ ion pair in a high-temperature ion conductive ceramic, copper (Cu) super-ionic conductor (CUSICON), was selected. The original framework of CUSICON was the sodium (Na) super-ionic conductor (NASICON).24 The low ionic transference number of CUSICON can assist the elemental analysis before and after the working of the battery.
The redox potential of Cu1+/Cu2+ in liquid at room temperature is +0.15 V versus the NHE.25 Previous studies have reported that the redox potential becomes more negative in NASICON-type materials than in a liquid solution.25,26 The Cu1+/Cu2+ redox potential in CUSICON may be more negative than +0.15 V, which is the top level of the valence band of β-FeSi2.
The pale blue powder of CUSICON was fabricated using a sol–gel method from a ZrOCl·8H2O aqueous solution, a solution of CuO in HNO3, and (NH4)H2PO427 (Fig. S2a, ESI†). The existence of Cu(I) and Cu(II) was confirmed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Fig. S2c, ESI†)26 for this powder (Cu2+/Cu+ = 3.3). A compact CUSICON was fabricated from the powder, and the temperature dependence of electron conductivity was measured using a two-electrode system in an electric oven. The electron conductivity was positively confirmed due to the significant increase in temperature observed at more than 550 °C (Fig. S2d, ESI†). The estimated activation energy between 480 and 800 °C was 103.5 kJ mol−1, which indicates a relatively large electron resistance for the CUSICON compact. This activation energy Ea was estimated by  Here, kB and T are the Boltzmann constant and temperature, respectively. The Cu ion cycle in CUSICON merely occurred.
These three materials were successfully assembled in the n-Si/β-FeSi2/CUSICON via uniaxial pressing and sintering control. A highly conductive Ag paste was used to connect Pt wires on each electrode. The size of the battery cell was 0.15 cm3. Battery characteristics were measured using the CUSICON side as the working electrode and the n-Si side as the counter electrode. No battery characteristics were observed at room temperature (Fig. 3a), but the battery characteristics at high temperature were confirmed (Fig. 3b). A maximal open voltage (Voc) of 0.67 V was successfully measured using an automatic polarization system at 600 °C. This Voc value was not because of the thermoelectric force of the Pt wire that was connecting the cell in the electric oven and the polarization system in the air, which generally provides dozens of mV between 600 °C and room temperature. The sensitized thermal cell was successful, as expected. The short-circuit current density (Jsc) was 9.1 μA cm−3 (Fig. 3c).
 Fig. 3  Thermocurrent voltage characteristics of a cell based on a colloidal β-FeSi2 film; the film, which was supported on n-Si, was used in a sandwich-like configuration. The size of the battery cell was 0.15 cm3. A layer of redox solid electrolyte, i.e., Cu0.5Zr2(PO4)3 fabricated by the liquid phase method was placed directly on top of the working electrode. The cell was exposed to a predefined temperature, (a) no battery characteristics were observed at room temperature, and (b) the battery characteristics were observed at 600 °C. An expanded image is depicted in (c). 
The temperature dependence of the generated current at the resting potential (+0.054 V) at room temperature was also observed (Fig. 4). The cell worked above 300 °C. This temperature is higher than 200 °C, above which the excited electrons in the β-FeSi2 were transferred to n-Si (Fig. 2). The rapid increase in the generated current above 500 °C was likely to be caused by the ion conductivity increase (Fig. S2, ESI†).

There is the possibility that the current generation is due to the involvement of an electrochemical reaction at the interfaces of n-Si/β-FeSi2 and/or β-FeSi2/CUSICON that was induced by the increase in temperature. The XRD spectra of CUSICON before and after the battery characteristics showed no change (Fig. S4, ESI†); i.e., the decomposition of CUSICON did not occur. Additionally, we could not find any Cu–Si phase, at least in the XRD spectra. The n-Si/β-FeSi2 interface has been well studied from the viewpoint of light-emitting devices. Generally, the combined n-Si/β-FeSi2 material was sintered above 750 °C to increase the crystallinity of β-FeSi2.28 No chemical reaction between n-Si and β-FeSi2 was reported. Regarding the interface of β-FeSi2/CUSICON, because the melting point of β-FeSi2 is 1220 °C, it is difficult to suggest that the atoms of β-FeSi2 would be melted into CUSICON. Additionally, it has been reported that Cu ion intrusion in β-FeSi2 would occur only above 927 °C.29
To confirm these previous results using our system, quantitative XPS analysis at the CUSICON surface before and after high temperature cycling was carried out (Table 1). If the Cu–Si phase is formed inside FeSi2, the number of Cu atoms in CUSICON should be decreased. Cu decreased by 0.1 mol% after high-temperature cycling. This value is within the error bar of our quantitative XPS analysis, as are the 1 mol% decreases in Zr and P. In short, we could not confirm the decrease in the total amount of Cu. The above discussion suggests that the electrochemical reaction at the interfaces of n-Si/β-FeSi2 and/or β-FeSi2/CUSICON did not occur in our system.

Single-step chrono-potentiometry (SSCP) was performed at 50 nA and at 600 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere. A steady increase in voltage was observed until 5 hours (Fig. 5). This steady increase in the obtained voltage might be caused by a decrease in the inner resistance of CUSICON as the redox reaction occurred. At the first stage, a large activation energy is required for ions moving in CUSICON because of the low ionic transference number. Once the ions moved, the activation energy became small, resulting in the decrease in the inner resistance.
 Fig. 5  Time-dependent voltage measurements at a constant current of 50 nA at 600 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere. The CUSICON was fabricated by the liquid phase method. 
After the measurements stopped, the obtained voltage was large at first (because of the rapid charge of the electrical double layer), decreased gradually, and then remained constant at approximately 0.65 V. When approximately 22 hours had passed, our oven temperature was decreased to 500 °C at 5 °C min−1, and the voltage was drastically decreased and became 0 V. This phenomenon is in good agreement with the temperature dependence of our CUSICON, in which the electron conductivity was increased above 527 °C (Fig. S2, ESI†). Then, we again set our oven to 600 °C. The voltage was reactivated and maintained at 0.60 V. These results suggest that the sensitized thermal cell functioned successfully.
After 6 h of operating the battery, the CUSICON on both the conductive paste side and the β-FeSi2 side was examined using XPS. To ease elemental analysis, the solid phase method (Cu1+ rich) was additionally used only for this XPS measurement. The characteristics of the CUSICON fabricated by the solid phase method are summarized in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The Cu2+/Cu+ ratio changed to 1.6 from an initial value of 3.3 at the conductive paste side in Cu2+-rich CUSICON and to 0.83 from an initial value of 0.67 at the β-FeSi2 side in Cu1+-rich CUSICON, which indicated the presence of the expected redox reaction, Cu2+ + e− ↔ Cu+ (Fig. S5, ESI†, Table 2). No Cu0 was observed in either case. When the final Cu2+/Cu+ ratio was set to 1 in the bulk of the CUSICON, the ratio became <1 at the Ag side and >1 at the β-FeSi2 side, as expected. Redox reactions of electrolyte ions occurred due to thermally excited charge carriers.

Here, we should note the peak shifts in Fig. S5b (ESI†) before and after operating the battery. It is known that most of the binding energy comes from the Coulomb interaction.30 In Fig. S5b (ESI†), as a result of the surrounding Cu+ becoming Cu2+, it is thought that the binding energy of the copper ion was reduced by 1 eV. The reason for the absence of an XPS peak shift in Fig. S5a (ESI†) is thought to be the fact that the amount of total current of the liquid phase method was 1/10 of the solid phase method and the change in valence was difficult to see. Details will be reported in the near future.
The battery characteristics of the two-material assemblies, namely, n-Si/β-FeSi2 (Fig. 6a), β-FeSi2/CUSICON (Fig. 6b) and n-Si/CUSICON (Fig. 6c), were also examined at room temperature and 750 °C. The tiny currents observed at room temperature (Fig. 6a3–c3) suggested that there was almost no electric current generation.
 Fig. 6  Schematic images of the transportation of thermal excited charge carriers in the two-material assembly; n-Si/β-FeSi2 (a1) β-FeSi2/CUSICON (b1), and n-Si/CUSICON (c1). A filled circle indicates an electron, and an open circle indicates a hole. The cyclic voltammograms were measured at 750 °C (a2–c2) and room temperature (a3–c3). The CUSICON was fabricated by the liquid phase method. 
Regarding the measurements at high temperature, the currents increased because of the thermally excited electrons. In this case, highly conductive electric parts become a resistance factor (R) and non-conductive parts, such as the interface of the β-FeSi2 particles and the CUSICON powder, become a capacitance factor (C). The latter, C, caused hysteresis in the cyclic voltammograms, as observed in Fig. 6a2–c2.
The oxidized current of Cu1+ due to the thermally excited holes was observed in Fig. 6b2 and c2. Zero Voc in the case of β-FeSi2/CUSICON (Fig. 6b2) suggested that there was no electric current flow to the counter electrode, thus reflecting the absence of an electron transport material. The important point is the movement of excited electrons in β-FeSi2 to the electrode. The absence of n-Si and the poor crystalline quality of β-FeSi2 might inhibit the movement. Only n-Si/CUSICON at 750 °C exhibited minor noisy battery characteristics, possibly due to the relatively large amount of thermally excited electrons in n-Si (5 × 1022 cm−3 at 750 °C). However, the power generation of n-Si/CUSICON had low reproducibility. This may have been due to the short lifetime of the thermally excited electrons in n-Si.
These results suggest that (1) the existence of thermally excited electrons in the semiconductor, (2) the transportation of electrons to the counter electrode and (3) the chemical reactions in the electrolyte are all necessary to generate the battery characteristics.
Methods
Fabrication and characterization of β-FeSi2
The experiments were performed using 99.9% pure commercial α-Fe2Si5 powder, which was supplied by High Purity Chemicals (Japan), with a specific surface area of less than 1 m2 g−1. Approximately 1.68 g of the powder was poured into a cylindrical graphite die with outer and inner diameters of 40 and 15.4 mm, respectively, and a height of 30 mm. Graphite foil with a thickness of 0.2 mm was used to protect the die and plungers. To enhance the thermal insulation, the die was also surrounded by a graphite felt layer that was 13 mm thick. These graphite materials were supplied by NJS, Japan.
Consolidation was performed with a residual pressure of approximately 10 MPa for 1 min using a high-pressure cylinder (J1, AS-ONE, Japan) equipped with a uniaxial press. Spark plasma sintering (SPS) runs were conducted in the temperature-controlled mode using a class 2 K-type thermocouple, which was supplied by CHINO (Japan) and focused on the lateral surface of the graphite container. All SPS experiments were performed at a sintering temperature of 800 °C and with a 30 min dwell time, a mechanical pressure of 55 MPa, and a heating rate of 100 °C min−1.
A black compact (15 mm ϕ, 2 mm thickness) of β-FeSi2 was successfully fabricated. The compact was crushed in an alumina mortar. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were obtained using an XRD-6100 from Shimadzu Corp. (Japan; 40 kV, 30 mA), which was equipped with a graphite monochromator using the Cu Kα line (λ = 1.54 Å) at room temperature. The results were compared with data from the International Centre for Diffraction Data. The existence of β-FeSi2 was confirmed in our measurements. Because our β-FeSi2 was prepared from α-Fe2Si5, Si was produced as the final substance. The strong background around 25° was due to the oxidized Si, SiO2. The presence of graphite peaks was also confirmed, which possibly originated from our use of a graphite die and/or graphite foil during SPS (Fig. S1a, ESI†).
The compact β-FeSi2 (5 × 5 × 2 mm) was placed on a hotplate (SR350, Advantec, Japan), and the temperature dependence of the electron resistivity was measured via the four-terminal method (Cu wire, diameter of 0.3 mm) using a source meter (2400, Keithley Instruments Inc., USA).
Fabrication and characterization of the CUSICON

Liquid phase method. 
The initial compounds included a ZrOCl·8H2O aqueous solution, CuO in HNO3 solution and (NH4)H2PO4, which were mixed in stoichiometric proportions. The colour of the compound was light blue, suggesting the presence of Cu(II). After drying at 80 °C for 1.5 days in air, the colour changed to pale green, which has been previously reported for CuIZr2(PO4)3. Further sintering at 800 °C for 8 h was performed, and the final colour was pale blue, suggesting the formation of Cu0.5Zr2(PO4)3. All chemicals were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals Industries, Ltd (Japan). All battery characteristics in this paper were measured using this CUSICON, except for the XPS measurement.


Solid phase method. 
CuO, NH4H2(PO4)3, ZrO2 and CuZr2(PO4)3 were placed in a zirconia pot in stoichiometric proportions with 8 ml ethanol and zirconia balls (2 mm dia.) and crushed by a planetary ball mill at 300 rpm for 1 h. The obtained grey powders were sintered at 300 °C for 4 h. The resulting pale blue powders were crushed manually, sintered at 850 °C for 16 h, and then milled again under the same conditions. Consolidation was performed with a residual pressure of approximately 100 MPa for 5 min using a high-pressure cylinder (J1, AS-ONE, Japan) equipped with a uniaxial press. The compact was sintered at 1200 °C for 16 h with a temperature increase of 5 °C min−1.31,32 Characterization was performed after crushing of the final sintered compact. This solid-phase CUSICON was used only for the XPS measurement in this work.


Characterization. 
The sample was subjected to IR spectroscopy (Fig. S2b, ESI,† KBr pellet technique, FT/IR-6100 type A, Shimadzu, Japan). The PO43− asymmetric stretching mode of the CUSICON was observed at approximately 1060 cm−1. The absorption peak at 940 cm−1 was attributed to the PO43− symmetric stretching mode. The presence of several peaks in the range of 610 to 500 cm−1 was related to the PO43− bending vibration.
XPS measurements were performed using a Perkin Elmer X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer 5500 MT (USA). All spectra were collected using Al-Kα (1486.7 eV) and a spot size diameter of 800 μm. The pass energy was 23.5 eV. The binding energies of Cu2p were 931.8 eV and 951.44 eV for Cu+ and 934.36 eV and 954.20 eV for Cu2+, which are identical to the standard binding energy of Cu2p in Cu2O and CuO. The peak at approximately 940 eV was entirely due to Cu2+. No Cu0 was observed.
Consolidation of the CUSICON for the ion conductivity measurements was performed using a residual pressure of approximately 20 MPa for 5 min and a high-pressure cylinder equipped with a uniaxial press. Two Pt wires (99.98% purity, 0.2 mm ϕ, 33 cm) were each connected to the 5 × 15 mm face of the fabricated compact (5 × 15 × 3 mm thickness) using a conductive Ag paste (product #597, Nilaco Co., Japan). The connected compacts were placed in an electric oven (KDF S-70, DENKEN Co., Japan). The ion conductivity was measured from room temperature to 800 °C using an automatic polarization system (HSV-100, Hokuto Denko, Japan). The temperature was increased at a rate of 5 °C min−1, and the voltage was set to −0.099 V (Fig. S2d, ESI†).

Cell assembly

n-Si(100) (ρ = 1–10 Ω, 525 mm thickness, Aki Co., Japan) was cut into 1.0 × 1.0 cm squares. After 5 min of treatment with a 12.8% HF aqueous solution, 0.0785 g of a conductive Ag paste (Pyro-Duct, Nilaco) was coated onto the Si, and 0.0309 g of crushed β-FeSi2 powder was uniformly pressed onto the paste plane. To increase adhesion, an insulating adhesive was applied to the edge of n-Si, and it was sandwiched with a glass substrate from the top. The samples were dried at room temperature for 2 h and subsequently at 93 °C for 2 h. For comparison, a reference sample coated only with the silver paste was also prepared.
The CUSICON powder fabricated by the liquid phase method was poured into a 20 mm Φ die to a thickness of 0.5 mm. The fabricated β-FeSi2/n-Si was set on the CUSICON powder with the β-FeSi2 side on the bottom. A residual pressure of approximately 20 MPa was applied for 5 min using the high-pressure cylinder equipped with the uniaxial press. The resulting CUSICON amount on β-FeSi2/n-Si was 0.1029 g. The assembled sample was sintered at 400 °C for 6 h (portable furnace F-B1414M, Barnstead/Thermolyne Co., USA) based on the Cu phase diagram to increase the sintered density of CUSICON. The temperature increase and decrease rate was 2 °C min−1. The final n-Si/β-FeSi2/CUSICON volume was 0.15 cm3.
The CUSICON compact fabricated by the solid phase method was set on β-FeSi2/n-Si.
The Pt wires were connected on both sides of the sintered sample using a conductive Ag paste. The Ag paste area was 40 mm2. The assembled sample was pinched using two glass slides (5 × 15 × 3 mm, Matsunami, Japan) to reinforce the Pt wire connection. A non-conductive inorganic adhesive (Aron Ceramic C, Toagosei, Japan) was used to bond the glass slides that had no connection to the power generation part. The assembled sample was dried at room temperature for 2 h and subsequently at 93 °C for 2 h.
Measurements of the cell characteristics
The assembled cell was placed in the electric oven and heated at 600 °C. The rate of temperature increase from room temperature was 5 °C min−1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles were recorded between −0.1 V and 0.8 V at 10 mV s−1, beginning from 0 V. No redox peak was observed in the measurement range, even during the first cycle. Single-step chrono-potentiometry was conducted in a nitrogen atmosphere (<0.1% O2) at 50 nA to maintain the temperature at 600 °C, and it was then decreased to 500 °C at 5 °C min−1 and then recovered to 600 °C. The temperature dependence of the electric current was also measured at the resting potential at room temperature (+0.0035 V).
Two-material assembly


n-Si/β-FeSi2. 

n-Si(100) was cut into 1.5 × 2.5 cm squares. After 5 min of treatment with a 12.8% HF aqueous solution, 0.0785 g of binder paste was coated onto the Si, and 0.0309 g of crushed β-FeSi2 powder was uniformly pressed onto the paste plane. The samples were dried at room temperature for 2 h and then at 93 °C for 2 h. The procedures for connecting the Pt wires were the same as in the “cell assembly” section above.


β-FeSi2/CUSICON. 
In total, 0.1700 g of crushed β-FeSi2 powder and 0.3049 g of CUSICON powder were poured into a 10 mm Φ die. A residual pressure of approximately 100 MPa was applied for 3 min using the high-pressure cylinder equipped with the uniaxial press. The procedures for connecting the Pt wires were the same as in the “cell assembly” section above.



n-Si/CUSICON. 
In total, 0.1075 g of CUSICON powder was poured into a 20 mm Φ die. A residual pressure of approximately 100 MPa was applied for 5 min using the high-pressure cylinder equipped with the uniaxial press. The samples were sintered at 400 °C for 6 h in the portable furnace. The temperature increase and decrease rate was 5 °C min−1. n-Si(100) was cut into 1.0 × 2.0 cm squares. After 5 min of treatment with a 12.8% HF aqueous solution, the sintered CUSICON compact was connected to n-Si using a conductive Ag paste. The procedure for connecting the Pt wires was the same as in the “cell assembly” section above.

Measurement of the electric characteristics of the two materials
The assembled cell was placed in the electric oven and heated to 750 °C. The temperature increase rate from room temperature was 5 °C min−1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles were recorded between −0.1 V and 0.8 V at 10 mV s−1, beginning from 0 V.
The temperature dependence of the generated current of n-Si/β-FeSi2 was measured using copper conducting wires on a hotplate. The temperature was measured using an infrared thermometer.
XPS measurements before and after battery testing
After the battery was tested for over 6 hours, the upper and lower support glasses of the battery were manually pushed aside parallel to the electrode surface, and the CUSICON part (1 cm dia., 1 mm thick) was separated from the battery. This separated CUSICON part was divided into 2 disks using an agate mortar and an agate muddler. Small amounts of CUSICON powder at the paste side, β-FeSi2 side, and centre parts were removed using a spatula and analysed via XPS, as described in the “Fabrication and Characterization of the CUSICON” section.
Conclusions
This study proposed a new conversion system of heat into electric power without a temperature difference, called a sensitized thermal cell. To prove this concept, redox reactions of electrolyte ions via thermally excited charged carriers in a chemical battery were examined. This concept was demonstrated using β-FeSi2 as the semiconductor material, n-Si as the electron transfer material, and CUSICON as the electrolyte. The cell exhibited a Voc of 0.67 V and a Jsc of 9.1 μA cm−3. Higher purity FeSi2 would lead to smaller inner resistance, and may show a larger open voltage. The acquisition voltage continuously maintained this value for at least 35 h in nitrogen. The redox reactions of the electrolyte ions due to thermally excited charge carriers were demonstrated using XPS.
These results demonstrate that electric power may be directly obtained from thermally excited electrons. The total reaction of this sensitized thermal cell is a type of endothermic reaction. For a fuller understanding of this mechanism, we will use non-equilibrium thermodynamics in our future paper.
This study used a low-ionic-transference solid electrolyte to demonstrate the redox reaction ability of thermally excited charge carriers, which was successfully proven. The sensitized cell can be completed using a high-ionic-transference solid electrolyte instead of a CUSICON. The advantage of our system is the large output power per volume compared with other existing technologies to convert heat because our system has a layer-by-layer design and can be applied three-dimensionally in heat sources. Semiconductors that have a larger amount of thermal excitation charge carriers, better electrical conductivity and longer lifetimes of thermally excited charge carriers would give us a more powerful cell. Conventional thermoelectric materials, such as skutterudite and half-Heusler compounds might be good candidates. A way to calculate the energy conversion efficiency considering the quantum efficiency and acquired voltage is under construction and will be reported in the near future. This “sensitized thermal cell” concept can be developed for all materials that can generate thermally excited electrons and addresses global energy problems.

Conceptual insights
In this manuscript, we firstly suggest a new thermal-to-electrical energy conversion system that does not rely on the Seebeck effect, does not require a temperature difference, and requires only a heat source; moreover, the system has a simple layer-by-layer structure. The main concept is the mimicry of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs); thus it has been termed a “sensitized thermal” cell. This cell uses phonons, a quantum expression of heat, instead of photons. Although it appears to be contrary to the second law of thermodynamics, it is not. The total reaction of this sensitized thermal cell is a type of endothermic reaction.


 	Fig. 1  Schematic representation of the sensitized thermal cell, indicating the electron energy level in different phases. The observed cell voltage at high temperatures corresponds to the potential difference, ΔV, between the Fermi level of the semiconductor material at high temperatures and the electrochemical potential of the solid electrolyte. The latter is equal to the Nernst potential of the redox couple (Cu2+/Cu+ in this case) and is used to mediate the charge transfer between the electrodes.
