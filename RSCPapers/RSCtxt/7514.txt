    , Accepted 7th March 2018First published on 9th March 2018AbstractAs a strong electron donor, indoline has been used in developing organic sensitizers for fabricating efficient dye-sensitized solar cells. Herein we report porphyrin dyes based on modified indoline donors. Firstly, XW29 and XW31 featured with a methylphenyl-substituted indoline and a bulkier dialkylfluorene-substituted indoline, respectively, are synthesized. XW31 exhibits a Jsc of 22.06 mA cm−2 as compared with that of 21.26 mA cm−2 for XW29. Consequently, XW31 achieves a higher power conversion efficiency of 10.46% than that of 10.14% for XW29. On this basis, to further broaden the spectral response, a benzothiadiazole (BTD) unit is incorporated as the auxiliary electron acceptor to obtain XW30 and XW32, respectively. The IPCE spectra are thus successfully extended to 850 nm. However, due to possibly aggravated dye aggregation, charge recombination and less effective dye regeneration induced by the BTD unit, moderate efficiencies of ca. 8.6% are obtained. Through coadsorption, elevated efficiencies of ∼9.9% are achieved for XW30 and XW32. These results provide further insights into developing efficient porphyrin dyes by combining the dialkylfluorene moiety with the indoline donor.
Introduction
As a type of photovoltaic device, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have created booming research interest over the past two decades.1 Particularly, the quest for highly efficient sensitizing dyes has never stopped. Compared with ruthenium dyes and organic dyes,2–5 porphyrin dyes have the advantage of relatively strong and broad absorption.6 In fact, impressive efficiencies have been achieved by porphyrin dyes such as YD2-o-C8,7GY508 and the landmark molecule SM315.9
For designing efficient porphyrin sensitizers, it is essential to broaden the absorption spectra for enhancing Jsc and suppress the unfavorable charge recombination for improving Voc.10,11 The absorption band can be broadened by extending the π-conjugation framework and/or strengthening the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect with suitable electron donors, acceptors, and auxiliary acceptors.12–16 However, a large conjugation framework is susceptible to dye-aggregation and charge recombination, which are unfavorable for the photovoltaic performance. To overcome this problem, bulky alkyl chains can be introduced to suppress dye aggregation and charge recombination.17–19
With all the aforementioned considerations in mind, our group has designed and synthesized a series of efficient porphyrin dyes based on carbazole,20,21 triphenylamine22 and phenothiazine23–25 donors, respectively. In comparison to these donors, indoline is another effective donor with strong electron-donating ability, and it has been widely used in organic sensitizers.26–29 However, its application in developing porphyrin dyes is rather limited.30,31 Herein, we report the design and synthesis of four new porphyrin sensitizers XW29–XW32 based on indoline donors (Fig. 1). With the purpose to suppress dye aggregation and charge recombination, a bulky dialkylfluorene moiety is attached to the N-atom of the indoline unit. Meanwhile, the universal ethynyl benzoic acid acceptor and the auxiliary benzothiadiazole (BTD) acceptor are used to further investigate the effect of the acceptor on the photovoltaic performance. By this porphyrin dye design strategy and the application of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) as the coadsorbent, efficiencies over 10% are successfully achieved. These results indicate that the introduction of a dialkylfluorene substituent into the indoline donor is effective for developing efficient porphyrin dyes.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthetic routes for the dyes are illustrated in Scheme 1. The details can be found in the Experimental section. Firstly, the commercially available material 1,2,3,3a,4,8b-hexahydrocyclopenta[b]indole successively underwent the Buchwald–Hartwig reaction, bromination and the Sonogashira reaction to obtain the ethynyl derivative of the indoline donor. Then the zinc dibromoporphyrin was utilized as the platform to attach the donor and acceptor to construct the D–π–A framework. Finally the target products were obtained by hydrolysis of the esters. All the dyes are air-stable and soluble in common organic solvents such as CH2Cl2, CHCl3, toluene and THF.

Optical and electrochemical properties

Fig. 2 shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the four dyes in THF and on TiO2 films, and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. The absorption maxima of XW29 are located around 458 nm and 673 nm, which are red-shifted by 10 nm and 43 nm respectively compared to the reported indoline-based porphyrin dye analogue CM-b31 (448 nm and 630 nm) without the ethynylene group between the donor and the porphyrin ring, showing the advantage of the ethynylene linkage in light-harvesting. Compared to XW29, a tiny redshift in the Q band can be observed for XW31, and the same trend is observed for XW30 and XW32. These observations indicate that the fluorene substituent on the N-atom of the indoline donor may be slightly more electron-donating than the methylphenyl unit. In contrast to XW29 and XW31, the BTD-containing dyes XW30 and XW32 exhibit further red-shifted Q bands (Δλ = ∼20 nm), owing to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the BTD unit.

For all the four dyes, their absorption spectra on the TiO2 films are slightly blue-shifted relative to those observed in THF (Table 1) because of a combined effect of deprotonation and aggregation. To make a clear comparison, the normalized solution and film absorption spectra are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). As compared with XW29 and XW31, more obvious blue shoulders are observed for the films adsorbed with XW30 and XW32, denoting a possibly aggravated H-type aggregation32 induced by the benzothiadiazole unit. It is noteworthy that the broadening character of the film absorption for all the four dyes is favorable for improving the light-harvesting ability.
To confirm the compatibility of the dyes with TiO2 and the I3−/I− redox couple in terms of energy levels, cyclic voltammetry curves were checked and the results are shown in Fig. S3, ESI,†Fig. 3 and Table 1. Apparently, the experimentally determined HOMO energy levels for the porphyrin dyes are located between 0.83 V and 0.86 V (vs. NHE), which are more than 0.4 V more positive than the potential of I3−/I− (∼0.4 V vs. NHE). Meanwhile, the LUMO levels range between −0.89 V and −1.00 V, which are more negative than the conduction band of TiO2 (∼−0.5 V vs. NHE), providing sufficient driving force for electron injection. It should be noted that the HOMO levels of the four dyes here are less positive than those of our previously reported sensitizers based on phenothiazine donors (0.90–0.93 V),33 indicative of the stronger electron donating ability of the indoline donor relative to phenothiazine.

Theoretical analysis
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to gain insight into the molecular energy levels and frontier molecular orbital distributions of the porphyrin dyes, using the Gaussian 09 program package34 at the B3LYP/6-31G* level.35–37 As shown in Fig. 4, the HOMOs of the four dyes are mainly distributed on the indoline donor and the porphyrin core, while the LUMOs are delocalized through the porphyrin core and the acceptor part. The appropriate charge separation and overlapping characteristics may facilitate the electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor and subsequent injection into the TiO2 conduction band.

It is obvious that XW29 and XW31 featuring the ethynylbenzoic acid acceptor afforded high efficiencies exceeding 10%, with Voc values of 716 mV and 720 mV, and Jsc values of 21.26 mA cm−2 and 22.06 mA cm−2, respectively. These values are comparable to those for the porphyrin dyes with indoline donors reported by You and coworkers.31 In contrast, benzothiadiazole-containing dyes XW30 and XW32 afforded lower Voc values of 678 mV and 677 mV as well as lower Jsc values of 19.67 mA cm−2 and 20.13 mA cm−2, respectively, resulting in lower PCEs of 8.68% and 8.82%, respectively. The lower Voc values observed for XW30 and XW32 relative to XW29 and XW31 may be ascribed to the aggravated dye aggregation and charge recombination effects induced by the auxiliary BTD unit (vide infra). The difference in Jsc can be reflected in their IPCE spectra (Fig. 5c). Devices based on XW29 and XW31 exhibit high IPCE plateaus, while those based on XW30 and XW32 exhibit broad but lower IPCEs. Such a trend has also been observed in our previous systems.38 It should be noted that the IPCE tails of XW30 and XW32 extend beyond 850 nm, possibly indicative of relatively serious dye-aggregation.39
As a special note, the Jsc values obtained from the J–V curves are deviated within 20% compared to the theoretical values calculated from integrating the IPCE curves (Table 2), which is rather large, but still within a reasonably acceptable range.40 Theoretically, the deviation can be mainly ascribed to the following three reasons: (1) the reflection and absorption of the FTO glass may account for ca. 10–15% loss in the IPCE;41,42 (2) the full irradiation applied in the J–V test generates more electrons and enables more efficient charge transport/collection than the wavelength-dependent light in the IPCE measurement;43 (3) the full irradiation includes near-infrared light and thus generates heat and an increase in temperature would lead to an increase in Jsc,43,44 while the wavelength-dependent light in the IPCE measurement barely exerts such an effect.
It is known that the IPCE is mainly governed by four factors: light-harvesting efficiency (LHE), electron injection efficiency (φinj), charge collection efficiency (ηcoll) and dye regeneration efficiency (ηreg).7 According to the absorption spectra on transparent TiO2 films (Fig. 2b) and by considering the thicker films with additional scattering layers used in the DSSC devices, it is anticipated that XW30 and XW32 with broader absorption would have slightly higher LHE values in comparison to XW29 and XW31.9,42 We then estimated the electron injection efficiencies by means of the photoluminescence (PL) decay measurements using the time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) technique.45 The values were estimated to be 85%, 92%, 81% and 94%, respectively (Fig. S4, ESI†). We also estimated the charge collection efficiencies from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis by using the equation ηcoll = (1 + Rtr/Rrec)−1.46–48 The corresponding values at a bias potential of −0.70 V were estimated to be 99% for XW29 and XW31 and 97% for XW30 and XW32, respectively (Fig. S5 and Table S3, ESI†). The lower charge collection efficiencies for XW30 and XW32 may indicate more serious charge recombination which may be derived from their longer molecular lengths and possibly more tilted adsorption orientation on the TiO2 surface (vide infra). It is obvious that the different effects of the above-mentioned three factors on the IPCE of the dyes with or without BTD are in trade-off relationships, and the lower charge collection efficiencies of XW30 and XW32 might not fully rationalize the relatively lower IPCE and Jsc values obtained for these two dyes. Hence, consistent with the lower Jsc values for XW30 and XW32, relatively lower dye regeneration efficiencies are assumed for these two BTD-containing dyes, which is in accordance with the reported results indicating that the longer molecular conjugation lengths of the dyes are correlated with inferior dye regeneration efficiencies for the porphyrin-based DSSCs.49
Based on the preceding results, we then used CDCA as the coadsorbent to suppress the dye-aggregation and charge recombination. The porphyrin dyes responded differently to CDCA (Table 2). XW30 and XW32 afforded improved PCEs of approximately 9.9%, as a result of ∼10 mV of Voc increase and 1.7–1.8 mA cm−2 of Jsc increase, which agrees well with the elevated IPCE plateaus (Fig. 5c and d). On the contrary, for XW29 and XW31, CDCA unfavorably deteriorated their photovoltaic performance, especially in terms of Voc.
To further understand the device performance, the dye loading amounts were estimated spectroscopically by desorbing the dyes into 0.1 M solutions of NaOH in THF/H2O, and the results are shown in Table 2. Interestingly, the dialkylfluorene-substituted molecules showed slightly higher loading amounts than their methylphenyl-substituted analogues. This observation may be related to the fact that the additional alkyl chains attached to the fluorene unit might improve the dye solubility and thus facilitate the dye-uptake.32 A higher loading amount is beneficial for light-harvesting and can improve Jsc if the aggregation is not obviously aggravated. Thus, it may partly account for the higher Jsc of XW31 with respect to XW29 device. On the other hand, much higher dye-loading amounts were observed for XW30 and XW32 relative to XW29 and XW31. However, lower Jsc values were observed for XW30 and XW32, probably indicating over-loading of the dyes. After coadsorption with CDCA, the loading amounts for all the four porphyrin dyes decreased because of the competing adsorption of CDCA. Apparently, XW31 and XW32 show more dramatic decrease of loading amounts as compared to XW29 and XW30, which could be rationalized by their bulkier structure.
Charge extraction and transient photovoltage decay measurements
To further understand the Voc variations for the DSSCs based on the four porphyrin dyes, charge extraction (CE) and transient photovoltage decay (TPD) measurements were carried out.
As shown in Fig. 6a, at a certain open-circuit photovoltage, the amount of charge extracted from different devices are almost the same, implying similar positions of TiO2 conduction band edges for the devices. On the other hand, the electron half-lifetimes (tTPD1/2) are quite different (Fig. 6b). For the individual dye sensitized devices, the electron half-lifetimes for the devices of XW29 and XW31 are much longer than those of XW30 and XW32, indicative of less charge recombination of XW29 and XW31, which is consistent with the EIS results (Fig. S5, ESI†). These results indicate that XW30 and XW32 might suffer from more serious charge recombination due to a possibly more tilted adsorption geometry associated with their extended conjugation lengths.50 After coadsorption with CDCA, devices based on XW30 and XW32 exhibit slightly prolonged electron half-lifetimes, while those based on XW29 and XW31 show decreased electron half-lifetimes, which are in accordance with the trend of their Voc variations. It could be deduced that CDCA helps relieve the more serious aggregation and charge recombination problems in the devices of XW30 and XW32, while it causes over-competing adsorption in those of XW29 and XW31.

Conclusions
With the purpose to develop efficient DSSCs, we have developed a series of indoline-based porphyrin dyes by simultaneously modifying the electron donor and acceptor. Specifically, methylphenyl and dialkylfluorene moieties were respectively introduced into the indoline donor. For the acceptor, the versatile ethynylbenzoic acid unit was used in the absence or presence of the auxiliary benzothiadiazole (BTD) acceptor. For XW29 and XW31 without the additional BTD acceptor, high efficiencies exceeding 10% were achieved. Compared with XW29, the introduction of the dialkylfluorene unit in XW31 is favorable for improving the dye solubility and elevating both the photovoltage and the photocurrent. As a result, a higher PCE of 10.46% was achieved for XW31 relative to 10.16% for XW29. By introducing the auxiliary benzothiadiazole (BTD) acceptor, the absorption spectra of XW30 and XW32 were successfully extended, showing striking IPCE wavelengths beyond 850 nm. In spite of the favorable absorption, XW30 and XW32 exhibit lower efficiencies of 8.68%, and 8.82%, respectively, probably due to more serious aggregation and charge recombination problems and less effective dye regeneration. Fortunately, upon coadsorption with CDCA, the corresponding efficiencies were improved to 9.87% and 9.94%, respectively. In summary, these results provide further insights into developing efficient porphyrin dyes by combining the dialkylfluorene moiety with the indoline donor.

Fabrication of solar cells
The FTO conducting glass was washed with a detergent solution, deionized water, acetone and ethanol successively for 20 minutes under ultrasonication before use. The preparation of the TiO2 electrodes and fabrication of the cells were adapted from that reported by Grätzel and co-workers.57 The photoanode was prepared by repetitive screen-printing. Afterwards, the TiO2 films were heated with a programmed procedure at 275 °C for 5 min, 325 °C for 5 min, 375 °C for 5 min, 450 °C for 15 min, and 500 °C for 15 min. The resulting layers were post-treated with 40 mM TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min and sintered once again at 450 °C for 30 min. Then they were immersed in a 0.1 mM solution of the dyes in a mixture of CHCl3 and ethanol (2:3, v/v) for 10 h at 25 °C for dye loading. For coadsorption, chenodeoxycholic acid was added into the dye solution as above mentioned. For the counter electrode, H2PtCl6 in 2-propanol solution was uniformly distributed on FTO glass through spin coating, and the cathode was heated at 400 °C for deposition of platinum. Eventually, the two electrodes were sealed with thermoplastic Surlyn, and an electrolyte solution was injected through one hole in the counter electrode to complete the sandwich-type solar cells. The electrolyte was composed of 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 1.0 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propyl-imidazolium iodide (DMPII) and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile.
