    , Accepted 20th March 2020First published on 20th March 2020AbstractA high-efficiency top-down approach was used to fabricate orthorhombic MoO3−x nanocrystals through the synergic effect of oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm), in which OA provided H+ ions and OAm contributed free electrons. This investigation might provide new guidance for manipulating the optical properties of metal oxide semiconductors.
Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) is known as a near-field enhancement phenomenon which refers to the collective oscillations of free electrons of noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) excited by incident light radiation. For the past few years, LSPR has been extensively studied due to its promising potential applications in photothermal therapy,1,2 photocatalysis,3–5 enhanced light scattering,6 sensing,7–9 and so forth. Furthermore, LSPR properties are deeply influenced by the size and shape of these nanomaterials as well as the surrounding medium.10 Nanomaterials with LSPR properties are mainly noble metals, such as Au and Ag NPs.11,12 However, their practical applications are severely restricted due to their expensive cost. Therefore, new plasmonic candidates are positively sought in order to suffice for their future sustainable developments. Recently, heavily doped semiconductor nanocrystals, as a new family of plasmonic material, have attracted widespread attention, such as non-stoichiometric transition metal oxides and chalcogenides.13,14
Among the transition metal oxides, the two-dimensional (2D) molybdenum oxide (MoO3) nanostructure has been a crucial candidate for outstanding LSPR hosts because of the excellent properties of the outer-d valence electrons.15 2D MoO3 is an important n-type semiconductor with a wide band gap (Eg ≈ 3.05 eV) and only absorbs ultraviolet light.16 In comparison with stoichiometric MoO3, the non-stoichiometric molybdenum oxide (MoO3−x) nanomaterial has shown intense LSPR absorption in the visible (Vis) and near infrared (NIR) region,3,17 which enables it for the utilization of solar energy in subsequent applications. Therefore, how to prepare non-stoichiometric α-MoO3−x nanocrystals has attracted wide attention. Till now, there are many reports on the preparation of layered α-MoO3−x nanocrystals.18–22 However, reports focusing on the preparation of small-sized α-MoO3−x nanocrystals are relatively few.23,24 In general, small-sized nanocrystals are prepared in organic solvents by chemical methods (also called as bottom-up methods).25 The crystal size can also be reduced by top-down approaches, such as e-beam lithography26 and laser ablation.27 However, these methods require expensive devices and are not suitable for the production of nanocrystals in the solvent phase. Therefore, the high-yield preparation of small-sized nanocrystals is necessary, although challenging.
As shown in Fig. S1a (ESI†), MoO3 crystals were constructed in different interlinked ways based on MoO6 octahedron building units with shared edges along the [001] direction and shared corners along the [100] direction (also called as zigzag chains).28 α-MoO3 showed a double-layered linked structure along the [010] direction with a thickness of 1.4 nm (Fig. S1b, ESI†).29 To acquire α-MoO3 nanocrystals with small sizes, in-plane Mo–O bonds should be broken up. Herein, colloidal α-MoO3 nanocrystals have been prepared successfully by a novel top-down method using oleylamine (OAm) and oleic acid (OA) ligands with bulk α-MoO3. The obtained products at different reaction times were first characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD patterns (Fig. S2, ESI†) showed strong diffraction peaks, matching well with the orthorhombic phase (JCPDS 35-0609) of MoO3, which were the same as those of pristine α-MoO3 (Fig. S3a, ESI†). A schematic diagram for the preparation of α-MoO3 nanocrystals is exhibited in Fig. 1a. The corresponding transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images displayed shapes of α-MoO3 nanocrystals at different times (0, 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 h) (Fig. 1b–e and Fig. S4, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 1b, pristine α-MoO3 displayed a lamellar morphology with its length and width in μm scale. From 1 h to 6 h, the morphology changed from small pieces (Fig. 1c) to thin sheets (Fig. 1d), and eventually to NPs (average diameter: ∼3.55 nm in Fig. 1e, see Fig. S5 for the size histogram, ESI†). The inset in Fig. 1e shows the corresponding high-resolution TEM image, from which the highly crystalline NPs with well-resolved lattice fringes were seen. After 6 h, the shapes and average sizes of the nanocrystals remained nearly unchanged (Fig. S4a and b, ESI†). The results indicated that the thickness and lateral dimension of α-MoO3 were decreased rapidly during the reaction process, implying fractures of the Mo–O bonds and disintegrations of bulk crystal structures.

The Vis–NIR spectra of the as-prepared α-MoO3 nanocrystals were also investigated. Pristine α-MoO3 showed strong absorption in the UV region (Fig. S3b, ESI†). For the products treated by a combination of OA and OAm, main peaks were observed in the region of 645–680 nm (Fig. 2a), which indicates that oxygen defects were successfully introduced into the α-MoO3. Besides, the redshift of the main absorption peak was observed as the reaction proceeded (from 645 nm to 680 nm), which was due to the fast decrease of α-MoO3−x thickness during the reaction process.30 In the meantime, a new absorption peak near 940 nm appeared with peak intensity increasing as the reaction proceeded, which was related to the change of the lateral dimension.30

To understand the stoichiometry of the obtained α-MoO3−x nanocrystals, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization was performed. The two peaks centered at 233.1 and 236.2 eV were attributed to Mo6+ 3d5/2 and Mo6+ 3d3/2. The presence of only Mo6+ for pristine α-MoO3 indicated the fully stoichiometric characteristics (Fig. S6, ESI†). However, the two new peaks centered at 231.9 and 235.1 eV were observed in α-MoO3−x nanocrystals (Fig. 2b) and assigned to Mo5+. Furthermore, the Mo6+ and Mo5+ contents in the samples were 74% and 26% of the total Mo according to the peak area integration. Therefore, the average oxidation state of Mo was 5.74, which proved a mixed-valence state deriving from the oxygen vacancies.
When changing the ratio of OAm and OA, obvious LSPR absorption could also be seen (Fig. S7a and d, ESI†). After 6 h of treatment with different ratios of OAm:OA, the as-prepared samples showed an obvious size decrease as the OAm:OA ratio increased (∼1–3 μm in Fig. S7c and 2.93 ± 0.12 nm in Fig. S7f, ESI†). However, negligible absorption in the visible region was observed for the as-prepared samples when OA or OAm was used as the sole solvent (Fig. S8a and d, ESI†), which indicates that no oxygen defects were introduced into α-MoO3 by sole solvent treatment (OA or OAm). It was perplexing that why sole solvent (OAm or OA) could not introduce oxygen defects into α-MoO3. The XRD patterns of the sole OA treated samples showed no noticeable changes as the reaction proceeded (Fig. S8b, ESI†). These patterns were assigned to the orthorhombic phase (JCPDS 35-0609) of MoO3, which are the same as those of pristine α-MoO3 (Fig. S3a, ESI†). After 6 h of reaction, MoO3 still remained as large thick chunks (Fig. S8c, ESI†). When using sole OAm, characteristic α-MoO3 diffraction peaks completely disappeared and unknown phases were formed (Fig. S8e, ESI†). After annealing this unknown phase at 350 °C for 2 h under N2, it was transformed into another α-MoO3 phase (JCPDS 05-0508) as seen in Fig. S9c (ESI†). Meanwhile, the crystal phases remained unchanged after calcination under the same conditions for pristine α-MoO3 and OA treated α-MoO3 (Fig. S9a and b, ESI†), which means that sole OAm would cause α-MoO3 to form an unstable unknown phase. In the meantime, fragmentary shapes were obtained for the OAm treated samples (Fig. S8f, ESI†). It was believed that OAm had a significant influence on the crystal structure and morphology of α-MoO3 during the treatment process.
Fig. S7b and e (ESI†) show the XRD patterns of α-MoO3−x nanocrystals prepared with different ratios of OAm:OA. The characteristic diffraction peaks of α-MoO3 (JCPDS 35-0609) were clearly observed. Furthermore, crystal phase transformation from α-MoO3 to MoO2.5(OH)0.5 (JCPDS 74-1648) was observed with OAm:OA = 2:4 after 9 h of reaction (Fig. S7b, ESI†). This was probably due to the insertion of H+ ions into the α-MoO3 crystals along the [101] direction,31 where the H+ ions were generated from the dissociation of OA molecules. H+ ion insertion might play an important role in the oxygen deficiency formation.30,32
The Raman spectra of the obtained samples were also studied to further understand the roles of OA and OAm during the treatment process. Pristine α-MoO3 showed three main Raman peaks at 663, 818, and 993 cm−1 (Fig. 3a), which were attributed to the stretching modes of the triply coordinated oxygen (Mo–O3), doubly coordinated bridging oxygen (Mo–O2), and terminal oxygen (MoO1), respectively. Three main Raman peaks were found for the samples treated by sole OA (Fig. 3b), which proved the retention of the orthorhombic α-MoO3 phase. For OAm treated α-MoO3, the characteristic peak of the Mo–O3 bond stretching was very weak at 1 h and totally disappeared as the reaction proceeded (Fig. 3c), indicating the breakdown of the Mo–O3 bond. It was probably due to the coordination between the lone pair electrons from N atoms in OAm molecules with Mo atoms, leading to the breakdown of the Mo–O3 bond. For samples treated with different ratios of OAm:OA, the evanishment of peak at 663 cm−1 and the weakening of peak at 993 cm−1 were also observed (Fig. 3d). In addition, a new peak at 860 cm−1 was observed, which was attributed to the distortion of the original Mo–O2 bond in substoichiometric MoO3−x.19,30 From Raman analysis, oxygen defects were proved to exist only in the samples treated by the mixtures of OAm and OA. Therefore, the mediated effect of OAm and OA could weaken and break down the MoO1, Mo–O2, and Mo–O3 bonds to generate oxygen defects.

Based on the above experimental results, a possible mechanism for the generation process of oxygen defects in MoO3−x nanocrystals was proposed as shown in Scheme 1. As is known, one of the most efficient post-treatment ways to form oxygen vacancies in the pristine MoO3 is hydrogenation.20–22 Herein, oxygen deficiency generation was based on a modified hydrogenation mechanism. OA provided hydrogen ions, which could enter into the bulk MoO3 crystal lattice. However, this process could not break up the bulk lattice to form nanocrystals. The lone pair electron in the amine group of OAm could coordinate with Mo6+ to weaken the Mo–O3 bond, thereby reducing the Mo oxidation state and breaking the crystal structure of bulk MoO3 to form an unstable phase. However, when using a combination of OA and OAm, OAm could enhance the deprotonation of OA and form oleate (OA−) and oleylammonium (OAmH+) ions.33 Therefore, under the mediated effect of OA−–OAmH+ ionic species, the hydrogen ion would bond with the triply coordinated oxygen atoms, forming –OH2 groups. The amine group from OAm would coordinate with the Mo6+ to release the H2O molecules. The crystal lattice was broken down to form nanocrystals and oxygen deficiencies were formed in the meantime.

To further verify the proposed mechanism, similar experiments were conducted for the h-MoO3 system. The internal connection of the individual zigzag chains through the cis-position in h-MoO3 is the main difference when compared with α-MoO3 (Fig. S1c, ESI†). This would result in the formation of a hexagonal crystal with a one dimensional tunnel of ∼3 Å in diameter (Fig. S1d, ESI†), which is composed of twelve octahedral units connected with shared corners along a and b axes as well as edges along the c axis.34 The pristine H2MoO4 showed no absorption in the Vis and NIR region (Fig. S10a, ESI†) and matched with the hexagonal MoO3 phase (JCPDS 21-0569) (Fig. S10b, ESI†). For sole OA treated h-MoO3 samples, the XRD peaks (Fig. S11b, ESI†) of the as-prepared products were also indexed to the hexagonal MoO3 phase (JCPDS 21-0569). Vis–NIR spectra displayed extremely weak absorption in the Vis and NIR region (Fig. S11a, ESI†). The H+ ions dissociated from OA molecules could easily enter into the open one dimensional tunnel of h-MoO3,34 therefore causing a slight change in the optical properties. However, nothing happened when pristine H2MoO4 was treated with sole OAm. Strong absorption in the Vis and NIR region was observed when using the combination of OAm and OA (Fig. S11d, ESI†), which means that oxygen defects were formed in these h-MoO3 samples. The XRD characteristic peaks of h-MoO3 (JCPDS 21-0569) were clearly observed (Fig. S11e, ESI†). The obtained samples also showed an obvious size change (3.02 ± 0.02 nm in Fig. S11f (ESI†), the inset shows the corresponding high-resolution TEM image.) relative to that of the sample treated by sole OA (∼1–4 μm in Fig. S11c, ESI†). These results indicated that this method was also successfully implemented to prepared h-MoO3−x nanocrystals with oxygen vacancies.
Due to the intense NIR absorption properties (800–1100 nm) of the α-MoO3−x and h-MoO3−x nanocrystals, their temperature elevation abilities were investigated. Fig. 4a and b exhibit the temperature elevation profiles of α-MoO3−x and h-MoO3−x nanocrystal in aqueous solutions under irradiation of 808 nm laser with a power density of 5 W cm−2 with different concentrations (25, 50, and 100 μg mL−1). The experimental results indicate that pure water displayed a minimal increase of temperature and α-MoO3−x and h-MoO3−x nanocrystals in solutions all exhibited an appreciable temperature increase over concentration and time upon exposure to laser irradiation. At a concentration of 100 μg mL−1, the recorded maximum temperature reached 71.7 °C and 70.1 °C for α-MoO3−x and h-MoO3−x that are far beyond the tolerable temperature for cancer cells.35 The corresponding photothermal conversion efficiencies were calculated to be 47.1% and 48.1%, respectively (for the detailed calculation process, see Fig. S12 in the ESI†). The conversion efficiencies were superior than those of other semiconductors, such as MoS2-PEG nano-flakes (27.6%),36 MoO2 irregular nanospheres (28.6%),37 hydrogenated TiO2 (40.8%),38 Cu9S5 nanocrystals (25.7%),39 and Cu2−xSe (22%).40 The above results demonstrated that the as-prepared α-MoO3−x and h-MoO3−x nanocrystals possessed excellent photo-thermal temperature enhancement abilities and could be great potential candidates for photothermal therapy of cancer.
 Fig. 4  NIR irradiation induced temperature elevation profiles of α-MoO3−x (a) and h-MoO3−x (b) nanocrystals (both samples were obtained after treatment of the corresponding bulk MoO3 with OAm:OA = 2.5:3.5 at 180 °C for 6 h) in aqueous solution with different concentrations, and water was used as the control (diode laser (MW-GX-808), NIR 808 nm, power density: 5 W cm−2). 
In conclusion, a novel method was proposed for the preparation of α-MoO3−x nanocrystals and the oxygen vacancy generation mechanism was thoroughly studied. Oxygen defects were successfully introduced into nanocrystals by using a mixed solvent of OAm and OA as surface-capping ligands. The obtained α-MoO3−x showed intense LSPR absorption in the Vis and NIR region between 400 nm and 1100 nm. This method could also be extended to prepare h-MoO3 nanocrystals with oxygen vacancies. In addition, the obtained MoO3−x nanocrystals showed prominent photothermal conversion effects owing to the strong plasmonic absorption in the NIR region. This investigation offers a straightforward picture of the oxygen defect generation mechanism in transition-metal oxides and might provide new guidance for manipulating the optical properties of metal oxide semiconductors.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  The schematic representation (a) and corresponding morphology evolution (b–e) of α-MoO3 treated by using a combination of OAm and OA (OAm:OA = 2.5:3.5). The time labels above the images indicate the corresponding reaction time.	 

 	Fig. 2  Evolution of Vis–NIR spectra (a) and Mo 3d XPS spectrum (b) of α-MoO3−x nanocrystals by using a combination of OAm and OA (OAm:OA = 2.5:3.5) during the reaction processes. (The Vis-NIR absorption fluctuations at about 900 nm are caused by instrument characteristics.)	 

 	Fig. 3  Raman spectra of (a) pristine α-MoO3, (b) α-MoO3 treated by OA, (c) α-MoO3 treated by OAm, and (d) α-MoO3 treated by different OAm:OA mixtures (reaction time: 6 h).	 

 	Scheme 1  The possible mechanism for the generation of oxygen defects in MoO3−x nanocrystals under the synergistic effect of OA and OAm.	 

 	Fig. 4  NIR irradiation induced temperature elevation profiles of α-MoO3−x (a) and h-MoO3−x (b) nanocrystals (both samples were obtained after treatment of the corresponding bulk MoO3 with OAm:OA = 2.5:3.5 at 180 °C for 6 h) in aqueous solution with different concentrations, and water was used as the control (diode laser (MW-GX-808), NIR 808 nm, power density: 5 W cm−2).
