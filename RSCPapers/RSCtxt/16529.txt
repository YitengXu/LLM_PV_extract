, Accepted 31st January 2016First published on 11th February 2016AbstractA simple and facile solvothermal method is developed for the preparation of a reduced graphene oxide/NH2-MIL-125(Ti) (rGO–NMTi) hybrid nanocomposite photocatalyst with large specific surface area and thermal stability. This rGO–NMTi-x hybrid nanocomposite exhibited a more efficient photocatalytic performance than NH2-MIL-125(Ti) for methyl blue (MB) degradation under visible-light irradiation due to the synergetic action between rGO and NH2-MIL-125(Ti). Therefore, rGO/MOFs photocatalysts have great potentiality in environmental remediation. The structure and physical properties of rGO, NH2-MIL-125(Ti) and rGO–NMTi-x hybrid nanocomposites were characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption/desorption, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), laser Raman, UV-visible absorption spectra (UV-DRS) and FT-IR techniques.
1. Introduction
As an environmentally friendly and cost-effective technology, visible light driven photocatalysis for removal of organic pollutants has been extensively studied.1–3 The photocatalytic activity of photocatalysts with a nanostructure depends strongly on their composition and structure.4–6 The main serious obstacles in developing hybrid photocatalysts include poor affinity between pollutants and photocatalyst,7 rapid recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs,8 low-light-harvesting efficiency of the photocatalyst,9 and short light residence time on/in the photocatalysts.10,11 Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), a novel class of hybrid materials constructed by metal-containing nodes connected by organic bridges, have attracted a great deal of attention due to their useful applications in gas storage, separation, catalysis, sensors, and other technologies.12–15 However, the performance of MOFs served as catalysts in photocatalysis is not comparable to that of inorganic semiconductors due to the low efficiency for solar energy conversion and photo-generated charge separation.
Hybrid material, a novel mixture of material has attracted a great deal of attention due to the exciting properties compared with pure counterparts.16,17 Compared with pure MOFs, the hybrids integrating MOFs with inorganic species (CdS, TiO2, Fe3O4, Cu2O, Au, Pd, and Pt) acted as photocatalysts presented significant advantages than the pure MOFs, owing to their synergism effect.18–24 He et al. reported that the photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency of CdS-MIL-101 hybrid materials under visible-light irradiation was superior to pure CdS nano-particles owing to photocatalytic reaction centers with high visible light harvesting capability, more active adsorption sites, and high specific surface area.18 Thus, far much attention has been focused on carbon-based materials, which contains a lot of prospective materials such as, graphene quantum dots (QDs),25 graphene,26,27 fullerene,28 and carbon nanotubes.29 All of them are extensively used as catalyst owing to their large specific surface area, excellent mechanical and hydrophobic properties as well as chemically stability. In addition, graphene exhibits several photocatalyst properties,30–36 including the extension of the duration of electron–hole pair, the enhancement of light adsorption range and intensity. According to the report of Qiu et al.,37 TiO2/graphene composites with high electrical conductivity and three-dimensional hierarchically porous structure prepared by one-step method exhibits potential photoactivity. Gan et al.38 studied the P25/graphene composite in degrading aquatic organic pollutants and discussed the contribution of photothermal effect in the photocatalytic performance. Zhang et al. and Wu et al.39–41 reported the MIL-88(Fe)@GO and the GR/MIL-53(Fe)–H2O2 photocatalytic materials, respectively for the degradation of dye or rhodamine B. However, NH2-MIL-125(Ti), as a highly porous MOFs photochemical property, not only contained high density of the immobilized Ti sites, but also presented isostructural MOFs with improved photocatalytic properties by tuning the incorporation of organic ligands. Therefore, the reduced graphene oxide/NH2-MIL-125(Ti) (rGO–NMTi) hybrid materials were designed and synthesized by a simple and facile solvothermal method. Its photocatalytic activity towards methyl blue (MB) dye degradation under visible-light irradiation was evaluated. The photocatalytic mechanism as well as the reusability and stability of photocatalyst, an environmental-friendly optimizing hybrid nanocomposite were investigated. The structure and physical properties of hybrid nanocomposite photocatalysts were characterized by means of SEM, HRTEM, Laser Raman, XRD, FT-IR, N2 adsorption–desorption, and UV-vis DRS techniques.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Sodium nitrate, hydrochloric acid, hydrogen peroxide (30%), barium chloride, sulfuric acid and potassium permanganate were purchased from Shantou Xilong chemical Co., Ltd, China. Graphite powder was received from Sinopharm Chemical Regent. 2-Amino-benzene-1,4-dicarboxylate (NH2-BDC) and tetra-n-butyl titanate Ti(OC4H9)4 (TPOT) were purchased from Alfa Aesar Co., Ltd, China and Shanghai Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, China, respectively. These reagents were analytical grade and used without further purifications.
2.2 Synthesis of GO and rGO/NH2-MIL-125(Ti) hybrid materials
Graphite oxide (GO) was prepared according to the methods in literature.42 The NH2-MIL-125(Ti) was synthesized according to the previously reported method with slight modification.43 A certain amount of GO powder was dispersed into methanol with the aid of ultrasonication. Then, TPOP (2.3 mL), NH2-BDC (2.1 g), DMF (35 mL), and GO–methanol (4.0 mL) mixture was subjected to solvothermal conditions in a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. The resulting solution was treated by ultrasonic for 15 min to obtain a uniformly dissolution of the reactants, and then kept at 120 °C for 48 h. After reaction, the resultant precipitate was separated by centrifugation, washed repeatedly with DMF and methanol, respectively. Finally, the as-obtained hybrid materials were dried at 100 °C under vacuum for 24 h. As-obtained precipitant were denoted as rGO–NMTi-1, rGO–NMTi-2, rGO–NMTi-3, and rGO–NMTi-4, where 1, 2, 3 and 4 represent the 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt% of GO in the samples, respectively. For comparison purposes, the conventional NH2-MIL-125(Ti) was prepared in the absence of GO under the same conditions.
2.3 Characterization
Morphology of the samples was characterized by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on a Gemini microscope (Hitachi, S-4800, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Panaltical X'Pert-pro MPD X-ray power diffractometer (Cu Kα irradiation source, λ = 1.54056 Å). UV-visible absorption spectra (UV-DRS) of the hybrid nanocomposites were obtained for the dry-pressed disk samples using a Cary 500 Scan Spectrophotometer (Varian, USA). The IR experiments were carried out on a Nicolet 670 FT-IR spectrometer in the range of 4000–400 cm−1. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) was conducted on FEI Tecnai G2 S-TWIN and the accelerating voltage was 200 kV. Raman spectroscopy was measured on Renishaw inVia plus using 633 nm laser excitation (Microplate reader: Biocell HT2). Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of the samples was measured using a sorptometer (ASAP-2420, Micromeritics, USA) at 77 K.
2.4 Photocatalytic evaluation
Photocatalytic degradation of methyl blue (MB) was carried out in a 100 mL beaker containing 40 mL of methyl blue solution (5.4 × 10−5 mol L−1) and photocatalyst (30 mg). The solution was stirred magnetically in a dark room for 20 min to get adsorption–desorption equilibrium. The solution was then irradiated under visible-light illumination (>420 nm). A 300 W Xenon lamp (Beijing China Education Au-light, Co. Ltd.) with a 420 nm cutoff filter was used as the visible-light source. At certain time intervals, 4 mL of aliquots were sampled and centrifuged to remove the photocatalyst. The MB concentration was determined using a UV-vis spectrophotometer at the wavelength of 663 nm. The degradation rate was calculated using below equation.Degradation rate = (C0 − C) × 100%/C0C0 and C are the MB concentrations before and after visible light photodegradation, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Morphology and structure of rGO–NMTi-x hybrid materials
The morphologies of rGO–NMTi-x were clearly observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and SEM images of GO and NH2-MIL-125(Ti) are also shown in Fig. 1 for comparison. It can be seen that the GO presented a sheet structure with wrinkle (Fig. 1a) whereas the morphology of NH2-MIL-125(Ti) (Fig. 1b) looks like the snowflake or cotton with some traces of amorphous phase. After a certain amount of GO powder was introduced during the synthesis, the SEM image of rGO–NMTi-x (Fig. 1c–f) revealed that the particles of NH2-MIL-125(Ti) agglomerated slight with different surface morphology. Moreover, the agglomerates of rGO–NMTi-1 nanocomposite look different from pure NH2-MIL-125(Ti). The sandwich-like structure between NH2-MIL-125(Ti) and rGO is not clearly in rGO–NMTi-1 due to low resolution. It is very possible that the introduction of more GO interfere with the NH2-MIL-125(Ti) crystal, which are even more visible for rGO–NMTi-3 (with 15 wt% GO) and the particles of NH2-MIL-125(Ti) become larger with incremental GO loadings (Fig. 1f).

The powder XRD patterns of rGO, NH2-MIL-125(Ti) and rGO–NMTi-x are shown in Fig. 2, it can be seen that there is a broad peak at 2θ = 26°, a typical character of amorphous carbon or graphene for rGO sample. In the meantime, the NH2-MIL-125(Ti) presented a typical structure of inorganic crystal (Fig. 2b), which are consistent with the result reported previously,43 demonstrating that preparation of rGO and NH2-MIL-125(Ti) are successful. Interestingly, for the hybrid composites, rGO–NMTi-x, a broad peak at 2θ = 26° reduced slightly compared to that of rGO but these peaks intensified with an increasing GO content (Fig. 2c–f), indicated that the amorphous structure of rGO existed in rGO–NMTi-x samples. According to the report of Hafizovic et al.,44 the presence of carboxylic groups on the surface of rGO would result in a distortion of the cubic symmetry. Hence, the characteristic peaks of NH2-MIL-125(Ti) reduced or/and disappeared in the rGO–NMTi-x hybrid nanocomposites (Fig. 2c–f) due to the differences in the building units of rGO–NMTi-2 and the other hybrid nano-composites. It is well known that the structure of both GO and NH2-BDC is π-rich, there should be strong π–π interactions between them. Therefore, the presence of GO sheets may unusually bend the NH2-BDC linker and results in severe twisting of the TiO5(OH) paddle wheel from an ideal octahedral square grid. Due to this distortion, the NH2-MIL-125(Ti) crystals would exist in a body centered unit cell instead of a primitive cell with symmetry.45,46 Therefore, the introduction of GO can affect the crystallization of NH2-MIL-125(Ti) and control the morphology of such heterostructures.

3.2 FT-IR spectra, UV-vis DRS and specific surface area of the hybrid materials
Fig. 3 showed the FT-IR spectra of rGO, NH2-MIL-125(Ti) and rGO–NMTi hybrid nanocomposites in the range of 500–4000 cm−1. It can be seen that a broad peak at 3400 cm−1 can be attributed to the O–H vibration of H2O in the FT-IR spectrum of GO. The absorption bands of CO and C–O were observed at 1718 and 1250 cm−1 in the spectrum of NH2-MIL-125(Ti) and rGO–NMTi-x hybrid nanocomposites. Moreover, NH2-MIL-125(Ti) and rGO–NMTi-x hybrid nano-composites present characteristic bands of the carboxylate in 1380–1600 cm−1 as well as the vibrations of O–Ti–O groups at 400–800 cm−1. These results verified further that the solvothermal synthesis of rGO–NMTi-x hybrid nanocomposites still maintained intact MOF structure of NH2-MIL-125(Ti).

The UV-vis DRS analysis of rGO–NMTi-x hybrid nanocomposites was conducted on a Cary 500 scan spectrophotometer. As shown in Fig. 4, a notable absorption extension in the visible-light region can be observed for rGO–NMTi-x hybrid nanocomposites and the optical absorption intensity enhances with the increase of rGO contents. According to the report of Fu et al.,43 there was absorption peak at 250 nm with absorption edge to 350 nm for MIL-125(Ti) whereas NH2-MIL-125(Ti) showed an extra absorption band at 400 nm with the absorption edge extending to ca. 550 nm, which originated from the induction effect of an amino functionality for its optical absorption, in agreement with our observation (Fig. 4a and b). However, it is of interest to note that a notable absorption extension band is observed (Fig. 4c and d) in the visible-light region when the content of rGO was more than or equal to 15% in rGO–NMTi-x hybrid nanocomposites. According to Zhang et al.41 for GR/MIL-53(Fe) composites, the optical absorption intensity in the range 500–800 nm increased remarkably after combination with appropriate amount of GR, which attributed to the background absorption of GR. We considered that the GO underwent quick deoxygenation (removal of epoxide and hydroxyl functional groups), which reflected enhanced π-electron conjugation and structural ordering with the restoration of sp2 carbon and possible rearrangement of atoms. FT-IR of rGO–NMTi-x (Fig. 3d and e) also confirmed that the vibration spectra of CO changed obviously which correlated closely with energy band gap structure.47 In the meantime, the change in color is companied form dark green of rGO–NMTi-2 to grey black of rGO–NMTi-3 (inset in Fig. 4.), in agreement with previous observations in other rGO based composites.41 It indicated that the synergetic action between rGO and NH2-MIL-125(Ti) can reduce successfully the recombination rate of the electron–hole pair in the rGO–NMTi hybrid nanocomposites. The red shift of absorption wavelength suggested that these nanocomposites can absorb effectively visible-light for the application in the visible-light photocatalysis.48

To further identify structural properties of the rGO–NMTi composites, Fig. 5a and b illustrated HRTEM images of rGO–NMTi-3; it can be seen that the irregular ball nanoparticles of NH2-MIL-125(Ti) are embedded in the wrinkling rGO lamellar structure and its morphology is similar to the observation from SEM of samples (Fig. 1) which is different entirely from the rod-shaped structure of MIL-88(Fe)@GO reported in literature.39,40 In addition, there were two typical peaks, G at 1595 cm−1 and D at 1325 cm−1 in Raman spectrum of rGO–NMTi-3 composite (Fig. 5c), meaning the existence of rGO in rGO–NMTi-3. According to the report of Li et al.,49 The G peak is associated with the first-order scattering of E2g mode for sp2 hybridized carbon domain and the D peaks are assigned to the structural defects corresponding to sp3 hybridization. Furthermore, the ratio of ID and IG was 1.05, indicating the efficient reduction of GO during solvothermal process. The abroad peaks appeared at about 1063, 856, 652, and 463 cm−1 are corresponding to the characteristic vibrations of metal terephthalate (Fig. 5c), similar to the observation in MIL-53(Fe)[H2O].40

As shown in Fig. 5d, the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms observed over rGO–NMTi-3 and NH2-MIL-125(Ti) attributed to IV-type adsorption curve. It can be seen that the adsorption contents at pressure range of p/p0 = 0.05–0.3 increased remarkably, meaning the existence of a large amount of micropores in NH2-MIL-125(Ti) whereas when the pressure range of p/p0 is more than 0.4, both adsorption capacities almost kept at a constant. The shape of hysteresis loop between adsorption and desorption branches illustrated the existence of slit-pores in the rGO–NMTi-3, which consisted of micro- and meso-pore. The specific surface areas of rGO–NMTi-3 and NH2-MIL-125(Ti), calculated via Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method are 750.3 and 1233 m2 g−1, respectively.
3.3 Photocatalytic performance of rGO–NMTi-x
The photocatalytic activities of the as-synthesized NH2-MIL-125(Ti) and rGO–NMTi-x hybrid nano-composites were evaluated via the photodegradation of MB under visible light irradiation (>420 nm), as shown in Fig. 6. It can be seen that there is not the photodegradation of MB to occur in the absence of photocatalyst (Fig. 6a) whereas all of rGO–NMTi-x photocatalysts show much higher photocatalytic activities than NH2-MIL-125(Ti) for the photodegradation of MB under the same experimental conditions due to the synergistic effect between NH2-MIL-125(Ti) and rGO. However, when the rGO content increased to 20 wt% there was a slight decrease in photocatalytic activity (Fig. 6e), which is still better photocatalytic performance of NH2-MIL-125(Ti) due to the fact that the higher contents of rGO in the rGO–NMTi-x hybrid nanocomposites will result in an redundant ratio between rGO and NH2-MIL-125(Ti), thereby lowering the electron transfer efficiency of the photoinduced electrons on NH2-MIL-125(Ti) to rGO surfaces. We may envisage that the photocatalytic activity of rGO–NMTi-4 declines with much higher loading in the composite photocatalyst under visible light irradiation. This result indicates that both rGO and NH2-MIL-125(Ti) play an important role in improving the photocatalytic activity due to the significant synergistic effect between rGO and NH2-MIL-125(Ti) for the photodegradation of MB under visible light irradiation.

3.4 Clarification of the reaction mechanism
It is well known that high adsorption ability, an efficient charge migration, and large surface area play a vital role for improving the photocatalytic activity.50 The existence of rGO sheets could facilitate charge migration and reduce the recombination of electron–hole pairs of the rGO based photocatalysts.51 Here, a possible photocatalytic process is schematized in Fig. 7. The photo-generated electrons originated from MB or rGO transfer to the Ti4+ in the titanium-oxo clusters of NH2-MIL-125(Ti) due to the adsorption or the heterojunction structure, Ti4+ is thus reduced to Ti3+. Oxygen molecules adsorbed onto porous NH2-MIL-125(Ti) to form superoxide (˙O2−) ion radicals via electron transfer from Ti3+ to O2 molecules due to the strong reducing ability of Ti3+. The Ti3+ ions are oxidized and further convert to Ti4+ ions. The electron transportation in the titanium-oxo clusters of NH2-MIL-125(Ti) via the presence of Ti3+–Ti4+ intervalence electron transfer had been verified by previous reports.43 The formed ˙O2− radicals could efficiently degrade MB (or MB+˙) into CO2 and water. Simultaneously, the generated holes of rGO are capable of oxidizing MB directly.52

3.5 Recyclability and stability of rGO–NMTi-3
The recycle experiments of rGO–NMTi-3 for photocatalytic reaction were carried out under the condition of visible-light irradiation to evaluate the stability of the photocatalyst. As shown in Fig. 8a, the efficiency for the photodegradation of MB after 5th-runs are still kept above 96.7%, indicating that the rGO–NMTi-3 can be used successively without the variation of photocatalytic performance during the oxidation of pollutant. The HRTEM images, XRD and Raman results of rGO–NMTi-3 before and after 5th-runs (Fig. 5a–c and 8b–d) revealed the high stability of the rGO–NMTi-3 photocatalyst in the structure and composition. Therefore, rGO–NMTi-3 hybrid nano-composites can be used as efficient visible-light photocatalyst for application in wastewater treatment.

4. Conclusion
A series of rGO–NMTi-x hybrid nanocomposites with large surface area, high activity and stability were successfully synthesized by means of a simple solvothermal strategy where rGO acted as the support for the formation of heterostructures. The results indicated that the rGO–NMTi-3 hybrid nanocomposites showed remarkably higher photocatalytic performance for the degradation of MB than NH2-MIL-125(Ti) under the condition of visible-light irradiation due to the synergistic effect between NH2-MIL-125(Ti) and rGO as well as the Ti3+–Ti4+ intervalence electron transfer. Furthermore, the rGO–NMTi-3 hybrid nanocomposites can be used as efficient visible-light photocatalyst for application in wastewater treatment in the near future.
