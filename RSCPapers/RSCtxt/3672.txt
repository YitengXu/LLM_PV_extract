    , Accepted 8th July 2019First published on 22nd July 2019AbstractGreenhouse gas emissions from anthropogenic sources are believed to be the main cause of global warming and climate change. Furthermore, fossil fuels are forecasted to remain the dominant source of energy in the near future. Therefore, capture and sequestration of greenhouse gases and in particular carbon dioxide is likely to be a major pathway toward environmental protection and energy sustainability. Such clarity has stimulated an intense and diverse range of research into various capture and mitigation technologies, which race with global warming in real-time. Quantification of the performance improvement rates of these technologies can inform decision-makers’ long-term investment strategies, and help researchers to identify technical bottlenecks and research potential. The present research estimates the yearly performance improvement rate of CO2 capture, non-CO2 GHG capture, and GHG mitigation technologies, using a novel method based on patent data and the corresponding citation network. Our findings suggest that membrane-based, condensation/rectification-based, and adsorption-based carbon capture are the most promising technologies. Furthermore, the average CO2 capture technologies are likely to improve slightly faster than solar, wind, and battery technologies, indicating their important role in future electrical grids. Unfortunately, subterranean or submarine CO2 storage was identified as a slow-growing technological domain and potentially a bottleneck in the future sustainable carbon chain, which requires further efforts.
1. Introduction
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), fossil fuels are forecasted to remain the dominant source of energy in the foreseeable future.1 The excessive use of fossil fuels results in significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.2,3 Other anthropogenic sources of emission include the cement and steel industries, as well as biogas production and fermentation. Unfortunately, the emission of greenhouse gases, in particular carbon dioxide, is directly related to global warming and climate change. Reduction of the emission of these gases crucially depends either on our ability to effectively capture or mitigate GHG emissions, or to substitute fossil fuels with green energy sources such as wind or solar. Effective realization of these options depends on how rapidly GHG capture and mitigation technologies, as well as green energy technologies, are improving.
Existing research on the quantification of technological progress has shown that technological domains, for which reliable time series of performance are available, systematically improve as an exponential function of time or as a power-law of cumulative production.4–7 The two relationships have been shown to necessarily co-exist if cumulative production increases exponentially over time. This is the case for most technologies for which we both have data on performance and cumulative production.5,6,8 Consequently, many technologies experience a constant yearly rate of improvement, as exemplified by the famous Moore's law for integrated circuits, whose computations per second improve at a rate of about 33% per year.7,9 Recent work has shown how the yearly functional performance improvement rate can be estimated by using patent-based indicators.10–12 In particular, Triulzi et al.10 have shown how a normalized measure of patent centrality in the global patent citation network is an accurate and reliable predictor of a technology's yearly improvement rate. In this paper, we apply this method to estimate the improvement rates of different GHG capture and mitigation technologies and compare them with those of wind turbine energy generation and solar photovoltaics.
2. Research objectives
The present research aims at quantifying the technological progress of carbon technology, with a view to achieve the following research objectives:
O1. At the highest level, it is desirable to compare the technological progress of the overall GHG capture technology with other green technologies. In particular, three technologies of solar power generation, wind power generation, and carbon capture from power generation systems all aim at decarbonization of electricity grids.
O2. Carbon capture and, in particular, the separation of CO2 can be achieved using a variety of technologies. At the sub-domain level, we will investigate the relative progress rate of CO2 capture technologies. This can give a sense of the most promising CO2 capture methods from a technological point of view.
O3. The third analysis will focus on the technologies applicable to the mitigation of non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions. These are compared with each other as well as CO2 capture technologies. Such an analysis is important as the various GHG emissions have different environmental impacts.
O4. Finally, we will study the technologies that do not deal with direct separation of CO2 or other greenhouse gases, but rather aim at their mitigation at a process level.
In order to address the above research objectives, it is necessary to identify corresponding technological domains defined by their purpose/function and their body of supporting knowledge.13 These technological domains are listed in Table 1, along with the corresponding Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) patent classes. CPC is a patent classification standard which is jointly developed by the European Patent Office and the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The domains are also categorized according to their function, namely CO2 capture, non-CO2 GHG capture, or mitigation strategies. In order to accomplish the first objective, we will compare the combined progress of domains #1–#9 in Table 1, with solar and power generation technologies calculated in another study.10,14 Objective 2 studies the progress of technological domains #1–#9. The domains denoted by #10 to #12 in Table 1 are concerned with non-CO2 GHG capture. The domains denoted by #13 and #14 in Table 1 are classified as mitigation strategies. These technological domains are further discussed in the next section.

The European Patent Office report15 recommends grouping “Greenhouse gas capture and storage” under the classification group Y02C. This group includes various methods for the separation and storage of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. In Table 1, there are two exceptions – #6 “Oxyfuel combustion” and #7 “Unmixed combustion (Chemical Looping)”. Although they are classified by CPC under group Y02E, i.e., “Combustion technologies with mitigation potential”, both these technological domains aim at separating CO2, which can be later transported and stored. By comparison, other technologies in the “Combustion technologies with mitigation potential” essentially aim at mitigating the emissions through increasing the energy efficiency, so for the same amount of converted energy, less CO2 is released to the environment. Of course, these methods can be combined with CO2 capture to further improve their environmental technologies. An example of such technological integration is domain #8 in Table 1, in which “Integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC)” is combined with carbon capture and storage (CCS). The abovementioned classifications and corresponding technological domains are shown in Fig. 1.

The influence of the shared bodies of knowledge on the applied methodology for the analysis of the estimated performance improvement rate can be explained conceptually as well as empirically. Considering the categorization proposed in Table 1 and Fig. 1, it is clear that the four subdomains comprising the CO2 capture and storage domain are from both Y02C and Y02E classes, hence they share key characteristics of both technological fields. Two types of shared bodies of knowledge are recognizable. An example of the first type is the technological know-how shared between CO2 capture subdomains (#1–5 in Table 1) and non-CO2 GHG subdomains (#10–12 in Table 1). As it will be discussed in Section 5.2. through analysing the most central patents, the subdomains #1–5 each represent a different method (i.e. technological solution) aiming at CO2 separation. The know-how applied in these domains allows separation of other GHGs too. In fact, motivated by economic incentives, some non-CO2 applications, such as natural gas sweetening, pioneered the research in the field. The key difference between the CO2 and non-CO2 separation technologies is in the disposal methods. While the large production scale of CO2 requires special methods for storage and utilization, the non-CO2 GHGs are often converted to less harmful gases and are disposed of in small and dispersed quantities. The second type of shared bodies of knowledge can be exemplified by #8 “Integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) combined with carbon capture and storage (CCS)”. The inventions in this domain are essentially the result of combining methods in the CO2 capture and storage domain and a specialized type of “Combined combustion with mitigation potential”. More quantitative analysis of the shared bodies of knowledge is presented in the online ESI.‡
3. Technological domains for greenhouse gas capture and mitigation
Carbon capture can be conducted using a variety of methods. The sources of CO2 vary from waste streams such as flue gases from power generation systems, to intermediate process streams such as those generated in coal or biomass gasification and ammonia synthesis, and the so-called cracked gases from naphtha pyrolysis, as well as undesirable CO2 in sour natural gas and biogases. Carbon dioxide can be separated even from the ambient air. In addition to direct separation methods, there are indirect methods as well, in which mixing nitrogen from combustion air with the fuel is avoided, so the combustion gases are purely CO2 and water, suitable for transport and storage. In order to classify the involved technologies into differentiable subdomains, we adopt the definition proposed by Benson et al.13 that a technological domain represents a set of artifacts that employ a certain body of knowledge to achieve a certain functionality, product or service. The technological domains and corresponding knowledge bodies involved in the capture and storage of greenhouse gases are shown in Table 1 and discussed in the following.
3.1. CO2 capture through biological separation
This method is inspired by natural photosynthesis processes, in which solar energy is applied by plants and biological organisms to convert carbon dioxide to a variety of biomass components, hence converting solar energy into (and storing it as) chemical energy. In general, microalgae and photosynthetic microorganisms such as cyanobacteria have a higher carbon fixation rate than terrestrial plants, and are identified as potential candidates for CO2 capture and utilization.17 The method of contact includes suspended and attached growth reactors, as well as bio-scrubbers.18 Technological progress in this domain includes optimization of the cultivation conditions and bioreactors, as well as the strain of microorganisms. Biological separation methods have proved efficient in the separation of other pollutants including formaldehyde, toluene and ethanol.18
3.2. CO2 capture through absorption
In the absorption process, CO2 is separated selectively by bringing the polluted stream into contact with a solvent. The underlying mechanism can be through the physical binding of CO2 to the solvent molecules, or may involve reversible chemical reactions. Pressure and temperature swings are applied to release the absorbed carbon dioxide, and regenerate the solvent. Absorption is a relatively mature technology and has been used in other industrial applications such as natural gas sweetening and ammonia synthesis. Recent technological progress has focused on the design and optimization of solvent characteristics such as CO2 loading, corrosion and degradation, as well as liquid–gas contactors and process integration. Multi-phase separation systems, including solid–liquid and liquid–liquid systems, are also under development.
3.3. CO2 capture through adsorption
Adsorption refers to selective physical binding of CO2 molecules to a solid surface such as zeolite, metal–organic and carbonaceous materials. Adsorption technologies are highly flexible and can be adopted for a variety of applications such as post-combustion and pre-combustion configurations, as well as separation from air. Another advantage of adsorption technology compared to absorption is the absence of solvent, whose emission even in trace values could cause environmental damage. Adsorption is a relatively well-understood technology, and advanced pressure or temperature swing adsorbers are commercialized for air and hydrogen separation. Recent advances are focused on functionalized adsorbents and structured configurations with rapid regeneration.19
3.4. CO2 capture using membranes
Membranes are essentially bio-inspired processes that selectively separates gaseous or liquid mixtures according to their molecular size and shape. Inorganic membranes can be operated at elevated temperatures. The research in this area is currently focused on the development of new membrane materials and structures including polymer, composite and mixed matrix membranes.20
3.5. CO2 capture through rectification and condensation
The patents in this category are broadly concerned with distillation and fractionation of industrial process streams which contain a substantial amount of CO2. The application of this method for combustion processes is thermodynamically limited, and not energy-efficient due to significant temperature differences. However, in other processes such as natural gas liquefaction and food industry processes, which are inherently low-temperature processes, this method has economic potential.
3.6. CO2 capture through oxyfuel combustion
The Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) does not classify oxyfuel technologies under the CO2 capture or storage class (Y02C 10). Rather, they are recognized in the Indirect CO2 mitigation technology (Y02E 20/34) class. Nonetheless, oxyfuel combustion is broadly recognized in the literature as a CO2 capture technology.19 In this method, oxygen is first separated in an air separation unit (ASU) using a cryogenic, adsorption-based, or membrane-based technique and then the combustion of the fuel with pure oxygen results in a CO2-rich mixture, readily available for transport and storage. Oxyfuel combustion is essentially a pre-treatment technology when integrated with power generation systems. It has also proved effective when integrated within cement kilns.19 Recent research in this area is concerned with the combustion mechanism, and mitigating potential corrosion.21
3.7. CO2 capture through unmixed combustion (chemical looping)
In unmixed combustion, also known as chemical looping, an oxygen-carrier catalyst is applied, which reversibly and selectively reacts with oxygen, separating it from the air. The catalyst later releases the oxygen to the fuel for combustion, resulting in a concentrated mixture of water and CO2. Iterative oxidation and reduction enable large-scale application of this technology. Similar to oxyfuel combustion, unmixed combustion is categorized by the Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) in the indirect CO2 mitigation technology (Y02E 20/34) class. Unmixed combustion has the advantage of a lower exergy destruction compared to other capture technologies, such as absorption. Chemical looping, in particular, is attractive when complete mixing is difficult to achieve, such as in rotary kiln incinerators. Its other advantages include high heat transfer density, the elimination of nitrous oxides, and reducing the volume of combustion gases, if scrubbing of sulfur compounds is needed.19
3.8. Integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) combined with carbon capture and storage (CCS)
The Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) has classified this domain as the methods that apply combined combustion configurations which can potentially mitigate CO2 emissions. In IGCC processes, coal or other fuels are gasified at an elevated pressure to produce synthesis gas (a mixture of CO, CO2, and water), which is combustible. Pre- and post-combustion capture configurations are applied, and the separation methods include absorption, adsorption, and oxy-fuel combustion.
3.9. Subterranean or submarine CO2 storage
This domain is concerned with the injection and storage of CO2 in geological formations such as saline aquifers, but more importantly in depleted petroleum reservoirs for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Depending on the reservoir conditions, the injection can be in miscible or immiscible regimes. Due to the lower viscosity of the injected CO2 compared to petroleum, there are often significant fingering and breakthrough effects which result in about 50% of the carbon dioxide returning back. Competitive technologies apply water or natural gas, instead.19
3.10. Non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions
Non-CO2 greenhouse gases have higher capacities for trapping heat in the atmosphere, known as the global warming potential (GWP). For example, a molecule of methane is 21 times more potent for the greenhouse gas effect than CO2. Similar values for nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride are 310, 140–11700, and 23900, respectively.22 As discussed in the following, the sources of non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions are highly diverse, which makes their capture and disposal challenging. Three major technological domains are classified by CPC.
3.11. Capture or disposal of methane emissions
Methane is released from very different resources including underground coal mining, oil and natural gas extraction and processing systems, municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills, wastewater treatment systems,22 livestock operations, and rice cultivation. Similarly, the patented methods are also highly diverse and include absorption, adsorption, cryogenic distillation, membrane separation, catalytic conversion, and so on.
3.12. Capture or disposal of nitrous oxide emissions
Nitrous oxide (N2O) is emitted from nitric and adipic acid production, livestock operations, and rice cultivation.22 The separation methods include adsorption, absorption, catalytic conversion, and cryogenic separation.
3.13. Capture or disposal of fluorinated gas emissions
The sources of fluorinated gas emissions are more diverse. HFC are typically emitted from refrigeration and air conditioning systems, foam product cycles, and solvent operations, as well as fire protection equipment. PFC are emitted from aluminum processing. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is released from the equipment used in electric power systems, and from magnesium processing. In addition, HCFC-22 production, semiconductor manufacturing, and photovoltaic cell manufacturing are sources of fluorinated greenhouse gas emissions. Along with substitution methods, the patented capture methods include adsorption, cryogenic separation, and membrane separation.
3.14. Greenhouse gas mitigation methods
The Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) has assigned the “Y02E 20/00” class to the combustion technologies which have potential for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. This technological domain is different from the technologies associated with the “Y02C” class, which aims at the separation and storage of GHGs. The patents are broadly classified into two groups of combined combustion “Y02E 20/10”, and technologies for more efficient combustion or heat usage “Y02E 20/30”. Each of these has their own subgroups and lower level classifications, a detailed discussion of which is not in the scope of the present study. We will aggregate the patents in each of these groups and study them for the sake of comparison with major carbon capture domains.
4. Methodology and data
To accomplish the research objectives, we retrieved patent sets for each domain discussed in Section 3, using the CPC classes reported in Table 1. We focused on patents granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) between 1976 and 2015. We used USPTO patents because of the commonly used assumption that valuable technologies for which patent protection is sought are sooner or later patented in the US. Patent data were downloaded from PatSnap, proprietary software for patent retrieval and analysis, whereas citation data were gathered from patentsview.org, the publicly accessible online platform of the USPTO. These data were used to estimate the yearly rate of functional performance improvement for each technological domain, using a methodology developed in recent work by Triulzi et al.10 In that study, the authors tested several indices based on patent variables as predictors of the improvement rate of 30 different technologies, for which they have empirical time series for functional performance. By cross-validation of various indicators, including the number of citations received by patents within the first three years, the average age of patents cited by a technology's patents, and the entropy of the assignee's patent shares, the authors concluded that a normalized measure of the average centrality of a technology's patents in the overall patent citation network provides an accurate and reliable estimation of the performance improvement rate.
The centrality indicator is based on the Search Path Node Pair (SPNP) measure proposed by Hummon and Doreian.23 SPNP is calculated as the multiplication of the number of incoming and outgoing citation paths from a patent and measures the centrality of each node within a network. In simple words, SPNP is an indicator of how central an innovation is within all paths of information flow in the patent citation network. As such, we can consider it a proxy for an invention's importance along the trajectories of technology development.
There are “time-specific” and “patent class-specific” biases that may distort the centrality calculations, as discussed extensively by Triulzi et al.10 In order to control for such interferences, the authors computed the z-score of the SPNP centrality of a patent by comparing its observed value with an expectation coming from a randomization of the citation network. Then, they normalized the z-score in a space from zero to one by taking rank percentiles. Subsequently, they computed the average normalized centrality of each patent granted by the USPTO between 1976 and 2015. Finally, for each patent, they calculate the average centrality of the patents it cites. This measure indicates how much a given patent is related to central paths of engineering improvements, and how much it interacts with other central patents. The authors then computed the average of this latter indicator for all patents in each technological domain and used it to predict the domain's performance improvement rate. This was done by fitting an ordinary-least-square regression whose dependent variable is the observed yearly performance improvement rate for each of the 30 technologies. The fitted equation can be used to predict the rate for a technology i for which patent data is available (like in the case of this paper). The equation is as follows. (1)As explained in ref. 10, since the dependent variable used in the regression model is the log of the improvement rate, we include a second term in the equation that is necessary to convert the estimated rate back to the linear scale. This well-known correction factor allows moving from a log-normal distribution to a normal one, where σi is the standard deviation of the estimated log of the improvement rate. In this paper, we use this equation to estimate the improvement rate for the different GHG capture and mitigation technologies.
5. Results and discussion
The first part of this section analyzes the identified patent sets in terms of their completeness and dependencies. The second and third parts report and discuss our findings regarding the quantification and comparison of the improvement rate of the various technological domains.
5.1. Pre-processing the patent sets: overlaps and interconnections

Fig. 2 shows the result of analyzing the overlap between the patent sets. The set called “CO2 capture and storage” is the aggregation of groups 1#–9# in Table 1. The set called “non-CO2 GHG capture and disposal” is the aggregation of groups 10#–12#. The sets called “Combined combustion with potential for GHG mitigation” and “More efficient combustion or heat usage” refer to groups 13# and 14#, respectively. The values in the off-diagonal cells are the number of patents in the focal domain that are found in the other domains, divided by the total number of patents in the focal domain. The values in the diagonal cells are the share of patents in the focal domain that are uniquely found in that domain.
 Fig. 2  The overlap between the major GHG capture and mitigation patent sets. 
The dark diagonal cells in Fig. 2 suggest that the three sets of “CO2 capture and storage”, “non-CO2 GHG capture and disposal”, and “More efficient combustion or heat usage” are to a large extent independent. However, “Combined combustion” technologies show a stronger overlap with other domains. This result was expected because the inventions in this technological domain either enhance the energy conversion efficiency or apply one of the technologies in groups 1#–8# to mitigate carbon emissions. In fact, it shares about 49% of its patents with the “CO2 capture and storage” domain. It is notable that the “Unmixed combustion (Chemical Looping)” and “Oxyfuel combustion” patents are shared between “CO2 capture and storage” and “More efficient combustion or heat usage”. However, they comprise only about 8% of the patents in the latter patent set. The 20% shared patents between the “CO2 capture and storage” and “non-CO2 GHG capture and disposal” is explained by the fact that a significant number of the CO2 capture methods and natural gas sweetening methods use essentially the same body of knowledge. Examples include absorption processes and pressure swing adsorption.

Fig. 3 shows the overlap between the CO2 capture subdomains. The diagonal dark blue cells suggest that the patent sets are highly independent, and each presents a specific technological domain. Most of the off-diagonal cells are bright, and the very light blue cells refer to hybrid technologies which apply two bodies of knowledge, especially at the process level. The high degree of independence of the patent sets of Table 1, as shown in Fig. 3, justifies their selection for technological improvement analysis including cross-comparison.
 Fig. 3  The overlap between the patent sets of the CO2 capture and storage subclasses. 

Fig. 4 and 5 show the results of the cross-technology citation analysis. Such interdependencies are best calculated by the so-called citation z-scores. We computed these z-scores following a procedure discussed in ref. 24 to assess the strength of knowledge relatedness between two technologies, while controlling for confounding factors introduced by differences in their number of patents and citation practices. The z-scores are calculated as the difference between the number of citations observed in reality between any pair of subdomains' USPTO patents and its expected number, divided by its standard deviation. The expected number of citations between two technologies is a hypergeometric random variable that we can calculate exactly assuming that citations are made randomly from a patent to another while preserving the same observed total number of patents in each technology, the number of citations made and received by each subdomain, and the filing year of the citing and cited patents (i.e. preserving the observed citation lag distribution). Therefore, we can compute analytically the z-score of citations between two domains after computing the expected number and the standard deviation (see ref. 24). The higher (lower) the z-score, the stronger (weaker) the knowledge relatedness between two subdomains. The high z-scores (light colors) in the diagonal cells of Fig. 4 and 5 suggest that each patent set form a cluster of patents related to an independent body of knowledge (in Fig. 5, blank cells indicate that there are no observed citations between the two subdomains). By comparison, the dark off-diagonal cells suggest little interactions between the technological domains. In Fig. 4, there are only two positive off-diagonal z-scores corresponding to the “CO2 capture and storage” and “non-CO2 GHG capture and disposal” domains. As discussed earlier, the common technical knowledge, especially in the separation of methane and CO2 from sour gases, is the key source of mutual citations. Interestingly, there are more patents in the “CO2 capture and storage” domain citing patents in “non-CO2 GHG capture and disposal” than the reverse direction (137 compared to 84). This observation is due to the fact that natural gas sweetening technologies were pioneered in this application area, and provided the founding scientific knowledge to the CO2 capture technologies.
 Fig. 4  The z-scores of citations between the major GHG capture and mitigation patent sets. 
 Fig. 5  The z-scores of citations between the patent sets of the CO2 capture and storage subclasses. 
Similar observations were made for the CO2 capture technological subdomains in Fig. 5, and most diagonal cells possess a high z-score. The exception is the “Integrated gasification combined cycle (GCC) combined with carbon capture and storage (CCS)” domain. Here, other separation techniques are applied in gasification processes and this domain does not independently represent a CO2 capture method. The oxy-fuel combustion domain shows the least knowledge relatedness with other domains. It is essentially a pretreatment technology focusing on air separation and combustion with pure oxygen, and has the least interactions with the other domains.
5.2. Patent centrality analysis
This section discusses in some depth the patents that are identified by our algorithm as most central in each domain and subdomain. Patents are first filtered by a normalized measure of the citations that they received within the first three years from filing.§ We then rank the filtered patents by their normalized centrality (computed as described in Section 4), also measured after three years from filing, and consider the top 30 most central patents in each subdomain. We filtered by citations received before ranking patents by centrality to further reduce noise introduced by the possibility that a patent is central because it cites very central patents but has only received very few citations itself (this is not very common but it does occur in a few instances).
Looking at the most central patents in each subdomain identifies key prevailing trajectories of engineering improvements in that domain. This is similar to how identifying the most central news articles by cross-references in a cluster of news stories identifies the key events of the story and how they are described and interpreted as the story unfolds. We focus this discussion on identifying the body of knowledge corresponding to the central patents, as well as highlighting other interesting observations, such as interactions between subdomains and the relevancy of the identified patents. For the sake of brevity, the most central patents are tabulated and reported in the ESI.‡ Tables S1–S4 (ESI‡) report the most central patents in the four major GHG capture and mitigation patent sets. Table S1 (ESI‡) lists the most central patents in the “CO2 capture and storage” domain. Within the top 30 patents, 13 patents (4130403, 6170264, 4934148, 5409525, 5850833, 5618332, 5972080, 6139604, 6128919, 6389814, 6247316, 6360524, and 7138007) use membrane science. Patents 4077779, 4256469, 4171206, 4333744, 4430306, 4544384, 4723966, 4813980, 5850833, and 6170264 apply adsorption technologies. Patents 4270466, 4627367, 4934148, 6170264, 6139604, and 6190160 are related to oxyfuel combustion. Patents 4854249, 4863371, and 4946382 are concerned with chemical looping inventions. Patent 4417449 is concerned with a cryogenic separation technology. Some of the patents exploit several bodies of knowledge. Interestingly, absorption techniques, biological separation, and CO2 storage inventions do not rank very central in this broad set of patents.
Table S2 (ESI‡) lists the top 30 central patents concerned with “non-CO2 GHG capture and disposal”. From these, 10 patents (4077779, 4121539, 4171206, 4544384, 4475929, 4723966, 4813980, 5229089, 6508057, and 6723155) are concerned with the separation of methane. Patents 4006066, 5785741, 6032484, and 6886573 are directly related to the separation of fluorinated greenhouse gas emissions. Patents 4773339, 5740669, 5771686, 6347627, 6508057, and 6826906 aim at the mitigation of nitrogen oxide emissions. Patents 7036304 and 7051520 invent methods for the mitigation of sulfurous compounds. From the application viewpoint, treatment of the emissions from semiconductor manufacturing processes is the main concern of 5 central patents (6066508, 6032484, 6521550, 6602808, and 6723665). The significance of pollution from semiconductor manufacturing is the diversity and toxicity of the emitted gases.25 In terms of the employed body of knowledge, adsorption technologies are applied in patents 4006066, 4077779, 4171206, 4544384, 4475929, 4723966, 4813980, 5229089, 5771686, 6032484, 6723155, and 7168243 (12 patents out of the 30 most central patents) for the separation of various non-CO2 GHGs. By comparison, patents 5771686, 6066508, 6347627, 6508057, 6521550, 6826906, 6602808, 6723665, 7036304, 7051520, 7168243, and 8516800 (12 patents out of the 30 most central patents) apply a variant of catalytic conversion.
Table S3 (ESI‡) reports the most central inventions in the “Combined combustion with potential for GHG mitigation” domain. From the 30 top patents, 10 patents (5011329, 5040972, 5072675, 5181481, 5261765, 5482402, 5724807, 7882646, 8114663, and 8544633) are concerned with combustion methods for incineration of waste, or decontamination purposes. Related to this area, patents 4092825, 4158948, 5069685, and 6786050 are concerned with the gasification of solid fuels. Within this domain, 6 central patents (4353206, 4473537, 4683715, 4827723, 5724807, and 6786050) are concerned with combined gas turbine cycles or methods which enhance the efficiency of such integrated systems. Equally importantly, the efficiency of energy conversion can be improved through innovations in combined cycles for the cogeneration of heat and electricity power, which is the focus of 6 central inventions (patents 4041906, 4069675, 4214451, 4338788, 4686378, and 5224334). Among these patents, three (4353206, 4473536, and 4473537) aim at the mitigation of NOx emissions through the improvement of the combustion method.
Table S4 (ESI‡) lists the most central patents in the domain of “more efficient combustion or heat usage” technologies. The inventions in this domain are more diverse and are broadly classified into direct and indirect methods for CO2 mitigation. Within the first class, patents 3945942, 4168946, 4411204, 4471702, and 4579067 report methods where reactants or catalysts are introduced, or multi-stage combustion chamber and recycle streams are employed in order to enhance the efficiency of energy conversion. Patent 4270466 reports a procedure for safe shutdown of the combustion system, to prevent accidental combustion or explosion. Within the second group (indirect mitigation), patents 4863371, 6389814, 6247316, 6293084, 6360524, and 7384452 are concerned with oxy-fuel combustion. Patents 6190160 and 7384452 are concerned with chemical looping. In addition, patents 4205630, 4773847, and 5263471 improve the efficiency of energy conversion through preheating the fuel and/or combustion air.
Tables S5–S13 (ESI‡) are concerned with the technological subdomains that aim at “CO2 capture and storage”. Investigation of Table S5 (ESI‡) suggests that the most central inventions in biological CO2 separation are associated with triphasic bioreactors in which carbon dioxide is physiochemically absorbed and sequestered by microorganisms (patents 6524843, 7579185, 7820432, 8110395, 8329458, 8329459, 8277769, 8329460, and 8329460). While most of the patents are concerned with CO2 capture, patent 6945925 addresses the capture of sulfur oxide and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Patent 7803575 is concerned with the separation of methane from biogas.
Table S6 (ESI‡) lists the most central inventions which apply absorption technologies for CO2 capture. Patents 4112052, 4112051, and 4477419 apply amines and their variant solutions for CO2 capture. Patent 4357801 describes geothermal solutions such as brine for CO2 separation. Patent 7208605 reports functionalized ionic liquids for CO2 capture. Patent 7754169 describes utilizing waste sources of metal oxides for CO2 capture. Patent 8540954 reports molten salts for such an application. Patent 4270937 describes an innovation regarding refrigerant–absorbent and cryogenic separation of impurities and liquid carbon dioxide. Patent 4714597 reports corrosion inhibitors for solvent treatment. Patent 5749941 reports the application of a hydrophobic membrane in an absorption process for gas–liquid separation. Most of the aforementioned innovations were concerned with the separation of CO2 from flue gas. The inventions reported in patents 4242108, 4430316 4475347, 4654062, and 7951355 describe methods for the separation of CO2 from natural gas, synthesis gas, intermediate process streams, and petroleum upstream processes. Evaluating the abovementioned patents suggests that most of the innovative research in the absorption domain is focused on the development of solvents with desirable properties. The focus of patents 4552572, 7637984, 7951355, 8377401, 8377401, 8196387, and 8715394 is at the process level.
Table S7 (ESI‡) reports the most central patents in the adsorption domain. A large number of patents documented in this domain are concerned with process design and system level inventions. Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) is mentioned in 15 patents (4077779, 4256469, 4171206, 4259091, 4333744, 4340398, 4475929, 4723966, 4732578, 4732580, 4813980, 4952223, 5220797, 5582029, and 6176897). Vacuum swing adsorption (VSA) is mentioned in two patents (5084075 and 5463869) for air separation. A zeolite and its variants (4430306 and 6616732), crystalline silicon oxides (7138007), and a lithium-exchanged FAU (6824590) are mentioned as central innovative adsorbent materials. An interesting observation in this domain is that a number of highly central inventions (patents 4256469, 4732580, 4934148, 5084075, 5463869, 5582029, 6139604, and 6824590) are related to air separation technologies, which suggests that this domain is supported by another application area.
Table S8 (ESI‡) reports membrane-based technologies. The innovative membrane materials include dried cellulose ester (4130403), an immobilized liquid membrane consisting of a solvent-swollen polymer and a microporous polymeric support (4737166), a hydrous gel (5409525), polyhydrazidoimide resins (5972080), copolyimide materials (6383258), silicon oxide (7138007), and an aromatic polyimide (8409325). Clearly, the development of innovative materials for membrane equipment has been a research frontier. Patents 4834779, 5618332, and 5928409 report inventions at the process level. In patents 4130403, 5591250, 6128919, and 6299669 the focus is the separation of CO2 from methane and natural gas components. The significance of this observation is that natural gas is often at an elevated pressure, appropriate for membrane separation. The invention documented in 5749941 reports a process in which the gaseous mixture is first brought into contact with a solvent and then is separated using a hydrophobic membrane. Patents 4781907, 5709733, and 6139604 report separation of nitrogen or air and CO2 is the by-product. The invention reported in patent 7931731 reports CO2 capture from intermediate process streams of an elemental-iron production process. Patent 8535413 reports CO2 separation from a fermentation process.
Table S9 (ESI‡) reports the capture methods which apply rectification and condensation. Combustion exhaust is at high temperature and a relatively low pressure (almost ambient pressure) and therefore thermodynamically does not favor condensation and cryogenic separation techniques. Therefore, most of the patents classified in this technological domain treat CO2-containing natural gas and hydrocarbons, or apply a hybrid sequence of technologies. Patents 4359871, 4274850, 4417449, 4449994, 4462814, 4599096, 4761167, 4681612, 4759786, and 4976849 treat natural gas and hydrocarbon streams. Patents 4681612 and 7332146 treat CO2-containing landfill gases. Patents 5100635 and 5233837 apply a cryogenic process for fractionation of exhaust combustion gases. Patents 4602477 and 4639257 report a membrane-aided cryogenic distillation process. The invention reported in patent 4990168 applies membrane technologies for mitigating emissions from a CO2 liquefaction process. Patents 4963339, 4952223, and 5000925 report the separation of CO2 from a syngas stream using a PSA unit followed by a liquefier. Patent 5133190 reports a centrifugal separation process followed by cryogenic distillation. Such hybrid separation technologies outperform standalone separation techniques by adjusting to the concentration of CO2 containing streams. Cryogenic distillation often serves at the final stages, where high-purity CO2 is needed.
Table S10 (ESI‡) reports inventions in “subterranean or submarine CO2 storage”. The reported innovations are highly diverse and include proposed methods for CO2 injection (7624801, 7922643, 8096934, 8622129, 8684085, and 8763710), underground controlling systems, storage capacity determination, and leakage detection (6860147, 7664624, 7726402, 7704746, 7859943, and 8225867), maximization of the sequestering extent (8256992), biomass reforming and CO2 injection for enhancing oil recovery (7753972), underground in situ production of hydrocarbons (7644993, 8596355, and 8485252), and so on.
Table S11 (ESI‡) lists the most central inventions regarding “Integrated gasification combined cycle (GCC) combined with carbon capture and storage (CCS)”. As mentioned earlier, this classification does not stand for an independent body of knowledge, rather it reports innovations in applying other CO2 capture techniques (mostly subdomains #2–#7 in Table 1) within integrated gasification processes. In Table S11 (ESI‡), patents 6148602, 6632846, 6976362, 7634915, and 8557173 apply various oxyfuel combustion strategies. Patents 7083658, 7445649, and 7988752 apply a chemical looping strategy for carbon capture. The invention reported in patent 8776532 applied a scrubbing system. Patents 6306917, 7937948, 8047007, 8168144, and 8409307 involve generation of synthesis gas and separation of carbon dioxide. Patent 8557024 applies a cryogenic separation technique. Patent 8349504 applies a post-combustion capture strategy. Patent 8133298 reports an iron production process integrated with power generation.
Table S12 (ESI‡) lists the most central patents regarding oxyfuel combustion. The inventions in this domain are highly diverse and study various aspects of combustion of a fuel with pure oxygen. Patent 4270466 is concerned with safe operational shutdowns. Patents 3945942, 4260361, 4671069, 4946382, 5500194 and 6907845 report innovative methods to mitigate NOx and CO formation during oxyfuel combustion. Patents 4627367, 4854249, 4863371, 6190160, and 7384452 are concerned with multi-stage fuel mixing, and preheating during oxyfuel combustion, at the process level. Patent 4850194 studies the burner and combustion system design. Patents 4800825 and 4867756 are concerned with sulfur removal from an oxyfuel combustion system. Patents 4493635, 6293084, 6298664, 6360524, 6382958, 6527828, and 6539719 are concerned with the design of the oxygen separation in a syngas generation process. The focus of patents 4279208, 5309850, and 5405537 is the oxygen-enriched combustion of industrial waste, dewatered sludge waste, and hazardous waste. Patent 4960380 is concerned with improved combustion, so the solid waste and incomplete combustion of hazardous materials are reduced. Patents 4928606 is concerned with combustion of low B.T.U. high moisture content fuels by oxygen-enriched air.
Table S13 (ESI‡) reports the most central patents in unmixed combustion and chemical looping technologies. Similar to oxyfuel combustion, the proposed inventions are highly diverse. Patents 5776226 and 5827496 report various catalysts and metal oxides appropriate for chemical looping and unmixed combustion. Patents 3969089, 6494153, and 6911057 describe sulfur removal methods for combustion of sulfur-containing fuels. Other patents are focused on application areas. Patent 6025403 applies chemical looping for producing synthesis gas. Patent 6669917 applies chemical looping in an integrated fuel cell and carbon capture process.
5.3. Technological improvement quantitative analysis
The bar chart in Fig. 6 visualizes the performance improvement rate of the four major capture and mitigation technologies (shown in red) in comparison with 30 other technological domains. The improvement rates for the capture and mitigation technologies are calculated using the method described in Section 4 and eqn (1), whereas the rates for the remaining 30 technologies are estimated by fitting the observed performance time series with an exponential curve (whose improvement rate is constant). The data for these time series come from ref. 7 and 26–28. The estimated rates come from ref. 5, 10 and 11.
 Fig. 6  The performance improvement rate of the four major capture and mitigation technologies (shown in red) and 31 other technological domains. 
With respect to the first research objective (O1) outlined in Section 2, the annual improvement rate for the “non-CO2 GHG capture and disposal” domain is faster than those for solar photovoltaics, wind turbines, and batteries. In contrast, the improvement rate of “CO2 capture and disposal” is almost identical to the ones of solar and wind, but faster than batteries. Combined combustion's rate is the same as solar and wind, but faster than batteries, whereas “More efficient combustion” improves as fast as batteries. The importance of this comparison is that all these technologies aim at the decarbonization of electricity power generation. While solar PV, wind and batteries are often recognized as potentially profitable technologies, carbon capture technologies have fewer incentives (without a carbon tax) due to the associated energy penalties.29,30 The fact that CO2 capture technologies appear to be a comparatively faster-improving domain than some of the other “green” technologies could be explained by the hypothesis that the main driver for technological improvement is the ability to take advantage of global broad science and technology progress, rather than the efforts within the domain. In other words, as discussed in ref. 10, faster-improving domains tend to have inventions that interact with other central inventions in the global patent citation network, which may suggest that they are in a better position to benefit from technological improvements in other domains. Interestingly, “Combined combustion with potential for GHG mitigation” and “More efficient combustion or heat usage”, which aim at mitigating GHGs by enhancing the efficiency of energy conversion, exhibit lower performance improvement rates. The reason for this observation is that technological domains whose artifacts have a higher level of physical interactions show slower performance improvement rates.31,32
The estimated rates for the four major groups are also shown in Table 2, where the 95% prediction intervals are also reported. The width of the prediction intervals is explained by the fact that eqn (1) is estimated by taking the log of the observed improvement rate for the 30 technologies (and by using heteroskedasticity robust standard errors of the estimates¶). This implies that the size of the prediction intervals increases exponentially as a function of centrality. In the absence of a formal theory that would help to determine how the global distribution of improvement rates across all the spectrum of existing technologies would look like, choosing to estimate the log of the rate is the most conservative modeling choice. In addition, it also has the practical advantage of avoiding estimating negative rates. Estimating a linear relationship would greatly reduce the width of the prediction intervals but would put us at risk of being overconfident about the estimated rate. Because of the similarity between the estimated rate across the four domains in Table 2 and our conservative modeling choice, we observe great overlap between the prediction intervals. This also applies to the estimated rates for the sub-domains reported in Table 3. However, one of the key objectives of this study is not so much to estimate the specific rate for one technology, but rather to compare them across technologies. This comparison is most usefully expressed in terms of the estimated likelihood that one domain is improving faster than another.

Fig. 7 shows the probability density function (PDF) of the yearly functional performance improvement rate for the above-mentioned four domains for the capture, mitigation and disposal of greenhouse gases. As discussed by Benson et al.,13 the difference of the PDFs can be applied to compute a new random variable that quantifies the likelihood of one domain improving faster than another. Fig. 8 reports the estimated likelihoods. From the figure, it is clear that the non-CO2 GHG technology domain most likely improves faster than any other domain. This might be associated with the breadth and depth of the knowledge that this domain has as well as its capability to utilize outside knowledge because of reduced interaction complexity as noted by its support from other adjacent industrial applications. The CO2 capture and storage technologies rank second, as they have extensive supporting bodies of knowledge shared with non-CO2 GHG technologies (they cite patents in this domain 137 standard deviations more than expected, as reported in Fig. 4). As discussed earlier, the last two domains have more complex technological artifacts and are expected to improve at slower rates.

 Fig. 8  The relative improvement rates of the four major technological domains, presented as the likelihood of a focal domain being faster than another domain. 
Similar results are presented in Fig. 9 and 10 for the nine CO2 capture and storage domains. As discussed earlier, membrane-based technologies remain a very promising option for carbon capture. The relatively high improvement rate of the condensation and rectification domain is also confirmed by this analysis. Such growth may be attributed to scientific developments in the food and natural gas processing industries but may well reflect lower interaction complexity.31,33 While membrane-based separation offers a cost-efficient option for carbon capture, especially at high pressures, cryogenic fractionation is capable of providing a high purity CO2 product. Therefore, the combination of these two technologies, especially in natural gas processing, where high-pressure and low-temperature streams of CO2-containing mixtures are available, is the most viable technology. Adsorption scientific knowledge supports the third most promising technological domain. It is less thermodynamically constrained and can flexibly adapt to a range of applications, including CO2 capture, natural gas sweetening, hydrogen production (especially from syngas) and more. Oxyfuel combustion is an emerging carbon capture strategy which has gained widespread industrial interest. While absorption-based carbon capture is broadly praised as the most in-reach capture technology, our analysis suggests that the rate of improvement of this technology is significantly slower than others. Unmixed combustion using chemical looping is the next capture technology, which has found applications especially in the cement as well as the iron and steel industries. Biological carbon capture is likely to be the slowest improving sub-domain. There are technological barriers with respect to the cultivation scale as well as water and land uses that need to be overcome before this technology can become commercially viable. In addition, the high complexity of biological inventions is consistent with the low improvement rates found here. All the above-mentioned technological subdomains focus on the method of CO2 separation. However, the captured CO2 needs to be stored or utilized in the downstream of the CO2 supply chain. Unfortunately, the technological improvement in the subterranean or submarine CO2 storage domain ranks as one of the slowest, and it could potentially act as a critical technological bottleneck in the whole value chain, before the economic and environmental impact of CO2 capture technologies can be realized. A deeper understanding of this bottleneck is an important area of future research effort.

6. Sensitivity analyses
The present research was based on several assumptions, including the CPC classification of the technologies (Table 1), and the fact that there are shared bodies of knowledge between some technological domains. A comprehensive set of sensitivity analyses is presented in the ESI‡ to examine the robustness of the results, considering these assumptions. The key observations are summarized in the following:
1. More granular classification results in a higher degree of consistency between the patent co-classification and citation relationship.
2. Co-classification is an inherent property of the patents investigated in this research, and illustrates the permeable boundaries between the underlying knowledge bodies, and as well as how these technologies have evolved. Such co-classifications also reflect a mechanism for technological improvement. For instance, reduction of costs, enhancement of the energy conversion efficiency, or enriching the CO2 effluent streams in the integrated gasification combined cycle [IGCC] domain, as an advanced combustion technology, all facilitate and enhance the adaptation of carbon capture in this technological domain.
3. The shared bodies of knowledge between the carbon capture domain and the non-CO2 GHG domain are either with respect to the applications in which carbon dioxide and other GHGs appear in mixtures (e.g. natural sweetening), or are concerned with the processes and materials adaptable to multiple applications.
4. Excluding the patents present in more than a single domain and recalculating the improvement rates revealed that the estimation of these rates is not sensitive to co-classified patents. In other words, including or excluding co-classified patents does not affect the mean centrality used to estimate the domain's improvement rate.
5. The normalization procedure for the calculation of the centrality measures used to estimate the yearly improvement rate takes into account differences in patent ages. This excludes the confounding effect of age on the measurement of centrality. As a result, there does not seem to be any significant difference between the subdomains analyzed here and the overall technologies patented at the USPTO in terms of the influence of the age of their invention and their ability to benefit from the knowledge generated before it.
7. Conclusions
The present research studied the improvement rates of greenhouse gas capture and mitigation technologies. A methodology based on the inventions documented as US patents and the citation network10 was applied to estimate the performance improvement rate of a diverse range of CO2 and GHG capture and mitigation technologies, as well as those technologies which aim at mitigation of such pollution through enhanced energy efficiency and improved combustion strategies. The focus was not on the absolute performance improvement rates but rather on the likelihood that one GHG capture technological domain (or subdomain) is improving faster than another, as well as the comparison of the speed of improvement with other green technologies such as wind, solar, and batteries.
The results of our study suggest that, despite various economic barriers (e.g., energetic penalties, large capital investment, etc.), GHG capture technologies improve slightly faster than solar, wind, and battery technologies, albeit the differences in rates are minimal, especially for CO2 capture. This observation suggests that the improvements in the capture technology are not derived from their economics and market demand, but rather from their central position within the scientific network and the flow of innovative information. Among the CO2 capture technologies, membrane-based and rectification/condensation carbon capture show very high promise, followed by the adsorption and oxyfuel technologies. Surprisingly, solvent-based absorption technologies did not rank highly, despite its wide-spread appraisal as a mature technology. An important observation of the present research was that the rate of improvement of the technologies involved in subterranean or submarine CO2 storage was ranked amongst the slowest. This observation suggests that potentially carbon sequestration will pose a critical technological bottleneck in the sustainable carbon value-chain. Finally, it was observed that mitigation technologies such as those involved in combined or more efficient combustion improve slower due to the high interactions within their body of knowledge.
