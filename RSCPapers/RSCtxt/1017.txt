    , Accepted 18th May 2023First published on 19th May 2023AbstractThe efficiency of photon upconversion (UC) from near infrared (NIR) to visible emission by the triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) mechanism in solids has been limited in spite of its importance. The singlet fission (SF) quenching of the fluorescence of rubrene, widely used annihilator and emitter, and back energy transfer (BET) from the emitter to sensitizer can be major reasons interfering with NIR TTA-UC. By introducing bulky substituents to the rubrene backbone and decreasing the sensitizer concentrations, we suppressed both SF and BET and achieved a high upconversion emission efficiency of ηUC = (4.0 ± 0.3)% (in the 100%-scale) for the cast films from the mixed solution of the sensitizer and the rubrene derivatives with tert-butyl and alkoxy groups. The effects of position and the kind of substitution to the rubrene structure on the optical and UC properties were investigated for the new emitters in the solid phase. The detailed mechanisms of triplet–triplet energy transfer (TET) and BET dynamics were clarified by time-resolved emission measurements. The UC emission dynamics was characterized by the fast (nanoseconds) and slow (microseconds) TET from the sensitizer to the emitter in solid, resulting in high TET quantum efficiency, which also contributes to the high ηUC.
Introduction
Triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) photon upconversion (UC) has shown remarkable development in the last decade because of the high efficiency and low operation intensity of light.1–12 Various applications have been proposed, such as photocatalysis,13,14 bioimaging and biomarker,15 polymerization,16,17 display,18 OLED,19 and anticounterfeiting. Among them, one of the most intriguing applications is to improve the efficiency of solar cells by converting the near infrared (NIR) light outside the sensitivity range, which could provide the way to overcome the Shockley–Queisser limit.20 Therefore, solid-state materials that convert NIR light to visible light are desired. Although much effort has been devoted to the development of such solid-state NIR-UC materials,21–33 their performance is still limited compared to solution-based and visible-conversion UC systems.
We have previously reported solid NIR-UC materials fabricated by the solution-casting method, which can convert 785 nm NIR light to visible yellow emission at about 570 nm, using rubrene as the emitter and matrix host material.22 The best UC emission efficiency (ηUC, defined as the full scale is 100%34,35) was about 0.5%, and detailed dynamics studies have clarified that the low fluorescence quantum yield (ΦFL) of rubrene in the solid state is the bottleneck of ηUC. This finding has attracted the attention of researchers to improving the ΦFL of emitter in NIR TTA-UC systems.29–31 In solution, rubrene is highly fluorescent with a ΦFL value of ∼90%, but in the solid form, it drops to 2–3%. This strong quenching in the solid state is now recognized to be due to singlet fission (SF).25,36 SF is the cooperative process in which a molecule in singlet excited state interacts with its ground state neighbor, converting the pair into two triplets, i.e., the reverse process of TTA (Fig. 1 top). The double of the energy of the triplet state (ET) of rubrene (1.14 eV × 2)37 is the same or slightly higher than the energy level of the excited singlet (ES = 2.23 eV), and the energy mismatch (2ET−ES) is only less than 0.05 eV. Therefore, SF virtually proceeds without barriers at the room temperature (kBT = 0.03 eV at 300 K) as a fluorescence quenching mechanism.
 Fig. 1  Energy stream of TTA-UC considered in this work (top) where Exc: photo excitation, ISC: intersystem crossing, TET: triplet–triplet energy transfer, TTA: triplet–triplet annihilation, SF: singlet fission, FL: fluorescence, BET: back energy transfer, 1S, 1S*, 1S**, 3S*: the ground, excited singlet, higher excited singlet, and excited triplet states, respectively, of sensitizer, 1E, 1E*, 3E*: the ground, excited singlet, and excited triplet states, respectively, of the emitter. Molecular structures of the rubrene derivatives (TBRb, DMeORb, DOcORb) as emitter (E) and host matrix and the sensitizer (S) used (PdTPTAP) as the doped guest (bottom). 
SF can be suppressed by maintaining a distance between the chromophores because it is based on the Dexter-type electron exchange mechanism, in which the overlap of wavefunctions plays a crucial role. Thus, in this work, we introduced bulky and inert substituents into rubrene at the tetracene core and/or the peripheral phenyl groups (Fig. 1 bottom), and their UC properties were tested with the cast solid by doping NIR sensitizer from the mixed solution. PdTPTAP, an excellent NIR sensitizer, was used in our previous work.22 Since SF and TTA are reverse processes of each other, in view of the elementary process, this “keeping distance” strategy has the risk that it may also suffer the TTA process. However, these two processes may not be perfectly counterbalanced to each other even for the case where TTA and SF are iso-energetic, and their equilibrium is balanced microscopically if the whole processes including exciton diffusion are considered.21 Based on a similar concept but independently from us, Kazlauskas and coworkers synthesized meta-di-tert-butyl29-substituted and 3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl-substituted30 rubrene derivatives and tested as the emitter in the solid. They found that a very large substituent (3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl groups) gives significantly negative effect on TTA-UC though the ΦFL is largely improved (by 40 folds).30 Meanwhile, the rubrene derivative with moderately sized substituents where the peripheral phenyl groups were partially substituted with 3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl groups showed that the two processes were not counterbalanced in the heavily doped system in the polymer matrix, demonstrating improved ηUC (by 4 folds) compared to that with unsubstituted rubrene.29
In our system, moderately sized substituents were introduced in the core (methoxy, DMeORb; octyloxy, DOcORb) and in both the core and peripheral groups (tert-butyl, TBRb). The linear alkyl chain of the octyloxy group is long but its flexibility and the fastener effect between the alkyl chains may not separate the tetracene cores too much. TBRb differs in their substituted positions from the previously studied tert-butyl substituted rubrene (only in the meta positions of the peripheral phenyl groups).30 To understand the influence on ηUC, herein, we focus on the competing deactivation channels (red frames, Fig. 1 top) from the singlet excited state of the emitter (1E*): SF, back energy transfer (BET) to the sensitizer, and the fluorescence (FL) resulting in UC emission, in addition to ordinary nonradiative deactivation. Because the efficient SF overwhelms other channels, FL was significantly quenched, and no clear influence of BET was found for the UC solid based on the unsubstituted rubrene.22 With the new rubrene derivatives, we witnessed that the SF channel slows down with increasing ΦFL for the neat solid, but the BET became prominent as an alternative quenching channel. By suppressing BET on dilution with the sensitizer, we found that both ΦFL and ηUC were increased in the same manner. At the lowest concentration, we obtained the maximum value of ηUC = (4.0 ± 0.3)% with TBRb, with an 8-fold enhancement from our previous result for unsubstituted rubrene. This ηUC is comparable to the reported value by the singlet sink approach (ηUC = (4.1 ± 0.3)%) using rubrene co-doped with DBP (dibenzotetraphenyl-periflanthene).33
Experimental section
Materials and their general characterization

PdTPTAP was synthesized as the reported method22 and used as a sensitizer. Rubrene (Rb, sublimed grade, 99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), TBRb (2,8-di-tert-butyl-5,11-bis(4-tert-butylphenyl)-6,12-diphenyltetracene, sublimed grade, >99%, Luminescent Technology Corp.), and IR-140 (C39H34Cl2N3S2 ClO4) from Exciton Inc.) were used as received. All commercially available reagents and spectroscopic grade solvents were used without further purification.

DMeORb (2,3-dimethoxy-5,6,11,12-tetraphenyltetracene). This synthetic procedure was previously reported for DMeORb (Scheme 1).38 2,3-Dimethoxy-6,11-diphenyltetracene-5,12-diones (1) was prepared from 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran by the addition of 6,7-dimeoxylnaphthalene-1,4-dione with p-toluenesulfonic acid. Then, phenyllithium prepared by the reaction of bromobenzene and n-butyllithium was reacted with 1, followed by HI-mediated aromatization of the corresponding diols, which gave DMeORb, which was further purified by silica gel column chromatography to obtain a red solid, leading to a total reaction yield of 5%. 1H-NMR (400 MHz, δ ppm, CDCl3): 3.59 (s, 6H), 6.53 (s, 2H), 6.87 (dt, J = 16.0, 1.3 Hz, 4 H), 7.03–7.10 (m, 14H), 7.35 (dd, J = 7.0, 3.4 Hz, 2H); 13C-NMR (100.7 MHz, δ ppm, CDCl3): 55.3, 102.9, 124.5, 125.7, 125.7, 126.5, 127.2, 127.4, 127.9, 128.6, 129.8, 131.9, 132.3, 134.5, 136.4, 142.0, 142.3, 149.7. The 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra are shown in Fig. S1 and S2, respectively, in the ESI.†

DOcORb (2,3-diocthoxy-5,6,11,12-tetraphenyltetracene). 2 was prepared from 1 by the deprotection of the methoxy group of 2 with HBr/acetic acid, followed by the addition of octyl bromide with K2CO3 (Scheme 1). Then, phenyllithium prepared by the reaction of bromobenzene and n-butyllithium was reacted with 2 to obtain its diol, followed by the HI-mediated aromatization of the corresponding diols, which gave DOcORb that was purified by silica gel column chromatography to obtain it as a red solid; yield = 6%. 1H-NMR (400 MHz, δ ppm, CDCl3): 0.87 (t, J = 6.7 Hz, 6H), 1.18–1.33 (m, 20H), 1.60–1.69 (m, 4H), 3.70 (t, J = 6.0 Hz, 4H), 6.49 (s, 2H), 6.83–6.90 (m, 8H), 7.01–7.11 (m, 14H), 7.34 (dd, J = 7.0, 3.2 Hz, 2H); 13C-NMR (100.7 MHz, δ ppm, CDCl3): 14.1, 22.6, 25.9, 28.5, 29.2, 29.3, 31.8, 68.2, 104.0, 124.3, 125.6, 125.6, 126.5, 127.1, 127.3, 128.0, 128.6, 129.7, 132.0, 132.3, 134.2, 136.3, 142.1, 142.4, 149.5. The 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra are shown in Fig. S3 and S4, respectively, in the ESI.† Single crystal was obtained from the mixture solution in methanol and dichloromethane of 1:1 in volume. The crystallographic data by single crystal X-ray diffraction are presented in Table S1 and Fig. S5 in ESI.†
General spectroscopic measurements and characterization techniques
UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra were recorded by a Shimadzu UV-3150 spectrophotometer. The fluorescence and fluorescence excitation spectra of the solution and bulk film were recorded by a JASCO FP-8300 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The fluorescence quantum yield of the prompt fluorescence of pristine and mixed cast films was measured by a Hamamatsu C9920 absolute PL quantum yield spectrometer with a calibrated integration sphere. The 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded using a Bruker AVANCE III 400 MHz with chloroform-d (CDCl3) and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard.
Crystal structure analysis
Data collection for X-ray crystal analysis was performed on a Rigaku XtaLAB Synergy-Custom diffractometer (Mo-Kα, λ = 0.71073 Å) equipped with a Rigaku HyPix-6000HE area detector. CCDC 2242334 (TBRb) and CCDC 2242335 (DOcORb) contain the supplementary crystallographic data.† The crystal structure was solved by direct methods (ShelXT) and refined by full-matrix least-squares procedures (ShelXL) running with the Olex2 GUI.39
Fabrication of the cast film
The same procedure reported previously was applied.22 Both the sensitizer (PdTPTAP) and emitter were dissolved in tetrahydrofuran in the defined molar ratio of 5.5 μM and 11 mM, respectively, giving [sensitizer]/[emitter] = 5 × 10−4 = 1:2000. Typically, 20 μL of this solution was dropped on a microscope slide slip and dried. The formed cast film was capped by cover glass with a 80 μm-thick spacer and was then sealed with a UV-curing optical adhesive. This geometry was kept the same as the reference sample for the fluorescence quantum yield measurement (IR-140/ethylene glycol (EG)) to minimize the error by difference in their optical paths depending on the samples. All procedures were carried out in a nitrogen-filled glove box with the oxygen concentration below 1.0 ppm.
Upconversion emission spectrum and emission quantum yield measurements of mixed cast films
A homemade microspectroscopic setup using an inverted optical microscope (Olympus IX-73) was used for the observation of upconversion emission image, recording the upconversion spectrum, and the determination of the upconversion quantum yield of the fabricated cast films.22,23 A continuous-wave diode laser centered at 785 nm (Integrated Optics, MatchBox785) was used as the light source. The beam was expanded in radius and slightly converged by a telescope so that an illumination area (130 μm in 1/e2-radius in Gaussian distribution) larger than the detection area (12.5 μm in radius by measuring the knife-edge method) was achieved through a 20× objective lens (NA 0.45). Emission was monitored at the rim of the cast samples where strong emission was observed. The emission was collected by the same objective lens and detected by an OceanOptics USB2000FLG fiber spectrophotometer. The obtained emission spectra were spectrally corrected for all optics including the microscope, fiber, and spectrometer. Upconversion quantum efficiency (ηUC) was determined based on the relative method using 100 μM IR-140/EG) solution (fluorescence quantum yield ΦR = 0.170)22 as the reference sample. ηUC was calculated by the equation  where F is the integrated emission intensity, A is the absorbance at 785 nm, P is the excitation power, n is the refractive index, and subscripts S and R mean sample and reference, respectively (IR-140/EG). We used nS = 1.00 for nitrogen gas and nR = 1.43 for EG. The approximation is valid when the absorbance is small (A « 0.1). The absorbance of the sample position from which the emission was collected was determined from the absorption spectrum measured with the same spectrometer used for the emission measurement by changing the microscope optics to the transmission mode. The light source for the absorption measurements was a tungsten lamp equipped in a microscope.22 The baseline distortion of the absorption spectrum due to light scattering was corrected using a quadratic function so that the spectral shape of the sensitizer absorption matched that in the solution (Fig. S6 in ESI†).
UC emission and prompt fluorescence time profile measurements
The time-resolved UC emission of the cast sample was recorded by 800 nm pulsed laser excitation using a Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier (Spectra-Physics Spitfire) in non-seeding operation (for nanosecond pulsed, 10 ns) and in seeded operation (for femtosecond pulsed, 120 fs, for simultaneous two-photon excitation of the pristine films) at a repetition rate of 1 kHz. Samples were irradiated with laser intensities of 22 kW cm−2 for the nanosecond excitation and 4.2 GW cm−2 for the femtosecond excitation. Emission from the samples was detected by a Si-APD (ThorLabs APD120A) connected to a digital oscilloscope (500 MHz, 5 GS s−1) through two excitation-cut filters (HOYA E-CM500S, O.D. 3 at 800 nm) and a 700 nm short-pass filter (Thorlabs FESH0700, O.D. > 5 at 800 nm). No laser scattering was detected through these filters (Fig. S7, ESI†).
Time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC)
The florescence decay of the sensitizer-doped TBRb films was measured by a homemade TCSPT setup (at Kwansei Gakuin University). The femtosecond white-light continuum generated from the output of a Ti:sapphire laser (Kapteyn–Murnane Lab., Cascade) with a cavity dumper operating at 2 MHz through a hollow fiber was used after selecting the excitation wavelength by passing through a 520 ± 10 nm bandpass filter (Asahi Spectra Inc.) as the excitation source. The fluorescence was detected by a cooled microchannel plate photomultiplier (Hamamatsu Photonics, MCP-R2809U) after going through an O56 short cut filter to cut the excitation. The signal pulse was detected by a time-to-amplitude converter module (Tennelec, TC864). The FWHM (full width at half maximum) of the IRF (instrumental response function) of the system range used was ∼90 ps because of its wide time range (44.2 ps/channel).
Quantum chemical calculation
The molecular geometries of rubrene and its derivatives were optimized for the singlet ground and triplet excited states using hybrid density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level (Tables S3–S10 in ESI†). The energy level of the triplet state (ET) was calculated as the difference in the total energy between the optimized geometries of the singlet and triplet. The energy level of the singlet excited state (ES) was calculated using the time-dependent (TD)-B3LYP with the same basis set (6-31G(d)). All calculations were performed on the Gaussian 16 program suit.40
Results and discussion
Absorption and fluorescence spectra
In toluene solution, the rubrene derivatives have the same absorption and fluorescence spectra as rubrene, except for small peak shift less than 7 nm (Fig. 2a and Table 1). Both absorption and fluorescence spectra in solution showed clear vibrational progression (four peaks for absorption and three peaks for fluorescence) for all emitters studied, meaning that they weakly interact with the solvent molecules. These results show that as an isolated molecule, the rubrene derivatives have almost the same energy levels as rubrene, and the substitution virtually does not affect their electronic states. The molar absorption coefficients at the peaks were ε = 9.2 × 103 for TBRb, 7.5 × 103 for DMeORb, and 1.2 × 104 for DOeORb in M−1 cm−1, which are somewhat larger than or close to that of rubrene (7.0 × 103 M−1 cm−1).

Similarly, for the cast solids, no significant peak shift (larger than 7 nm) was observed for the fluorescence excitation spectrum, which is measured instead of the absorption spectrum (Fig. 2b and Table 1). Interestingly, TBRb showed significant broadening of the peaks in fluorescence and fluorescence excitation spectra, and it has a larger Stokes shift than others. This suggests its stronger intermolecular interaction than others in cast solid.
Crystal packing
The obtained cast films are amorphous, vide infra; nevertheless, the X-ray crystallographic study of the single crystal may give useful information (Fig. S5, Table S1, ESI†). TBRb has a planar tetracene core and shows face-to-face packing of the π-conjugation plane while DOcORb has a twisted core, as seen in many rubrene derivatives.38 The face-to-face packing with the planar structure accelerates intermolecular interaction through π–π stacking, possibly explaining the peak broadening of TBRb. On the other hand, the twisted structure of DOcORb suggests its loose packing where the local situation is close to that in the solution.
Energy levels of triplet state

E
T of the rubrene derivatives was estimated by quantum chemical calculations (Table 2). The calculated value of rubrene (ET = 1.00 eV) was slightly smaller than the reported value (1.14 eV).37 The calculated ET was unchanged to alkyl or alkoxy substitution regardless of its position (∼1.0 eV) while it was slightly increased with the alkoxy substitution in the tetracene core (∼1.1 eV). These results showed that the substitutions give virtually no impact on the electronic energy levels. The ET values are close to and lower than that of PdTPTAP (ET = 1.17 eV),22 suggesting that efficient triplet-triplet energy transfer (TET) occurs to the emitter. The calculated values of energy mismatch for TTA (2ET−ES) were slightly negative, suggesting the SF-preferred configuration of the energy levels from the calculations.

Fluorescence quantum yield
In toluene solution, the ΦFL values of rubrene derivatives were about 65% (Table 1). These values are lower than that of unsubstituted rubrene in the solution (90%, based on ΦFL = 89% of rhodamine 101 in ethanol,22,41 consistent with the previous reports (98–100%)42–44). The ΦFLof unsubstituted rubrene significantly dropped to 3.3% as known already; however, those of the rubrene derivatives were in the range of 30–40%. These values of the rubrene derivatives were smaller than those in solution but they were still 10 folds as large as that of unsubstituted rubrene in the solid state (∼3.3%). These results suggest that the fluorescence quenching by SF is efficiently suppressed for the derivatives by introducing a bulky substituent, as expected. This behavior is consistent with the previous reports.29,30,45 The ΦFL of TBRb in the cast solid (29%) was smaller than that of the film fabricated by vapor deposition (46%),45 probably due to the difference in molecular packing.
UC emission from the cast solid of the rubrene derivatives and ΦFL with the sensitizer
The sensitizer-doped cast solids were fabricated from the mixed solution of both the sensitizer (PdTPTAP) and emitter in THF (see Experimental section). The morphology of the cast solids was observed by polarization microscopy. The crossed Nicole images showed that the cast films were amorphous solids (Fig. S8 in ESI†). For TBRb, many cracks were found all over the sample.
By irradiating 785 nm NIR light, all films showed visible yellow emission (Fig. 3a–c). The obtained spectra of the films (Fig. 3d) exactly matched their corresponding fluorescence spectra of the pristine films with the anti-Stokes shift of 0.55 eV for PdTPTAP:TBRb and 0.60 eV for the others (Fig. 2b). Thus, upconversion (UC) emission was obtained for all the films. For the case of TBRb, bright lines correspond to the cracks, suggesting that they occur as the edge emission of the waveguiding effect in the film. Monitoring the emission at crack might overestimate the intensity; thus, UC emission was monitored at the flat part avoiding the cracks. The cracks were also observed for the pristine film of TBRb (Fig. S9, ESI†). The cracks are probably formed by shrinkage on drying because they mostly appeared in the thick part of the cast films.

The blocked wavelength range by a notch filter is shown with the gray box. The concentration ratio was [PdTPTAP]:[emitter] = 5.5 μM:11 mM (in the mother solution) = 1:2000. The excitation intensity was 17 W cm−2. 
The excitation intensity dependences of the UC emission were measured for the mixed cast films (Fig. 4). They were analyzed by the theoretical model for TTA-UC derived from the rate equations35 (1)where y is the observed emission intensity, x is the excitation intensity, and a is the proportionality factor including instrument constant. The fitting parameter b gives the information of the threshold excitation intensity Ith= 2/b. Ith is defined as the excitation intensity at which two extrapolation lines of the linear and quadratic dependences on the emission intensity are crossing, and a fraction of 0.382 of the emitter triplet population deactivates via the bimolecular channel, which is characteristic for the TTA-UC system.

The concentration ratio was [PdTPTAP]:[emitter] = 1:2000 for all. The curve fit with eqn (1) is shown with a blue curve. The circles in the inset images indicate the detection area of the upconverted intensity for each sample. 
The data were found to be fitted well with eqn (1) for the range below the excitation intensity of ∼20 W cm−2. These agreements of the curve fits also support the TTA-UC mechanism for the observed UC emission. Over the intensity range, the dependences tend to be sublinear, suggesting that saturation occurs. The values of Ith obtained from the curve fittings (Table 3) were ∼4 W cm−2 for the PdTPTAP:TBRb film and ∼1 W cm−2 for the other two. These values are similar or slightly higher than that of the PdTPTAP:Rb film previously reported.22 To check if the saturation originated from the degradation of the sample or not, we performed the measurements of the excitation-intensity dependence by a round-trip course in the excitation intensity change, i.e., from the lowest to the highest and then going back to the lowest (Fig. S10 in ESI†). The results of both increasing and decreasing directions of the excitation intensity perfectly overlapped for all the samples. Therefore, saturation arises from another mechanism rather than degradation, such as the saturation of absorption due to the high excitation intensity.

By measuring the absorption spectrum at the same sample position at which the UC emission was observed, ηUC can be calculated by referring the fluorescence measurement of the IR-140/EG sample as the quantum yield reference (see Experimental). The excitation intensity dependence of ηUC was readily calculated from the dependence of UC emission (Fig. S11, ESI†). The ηUC increased with the increase in the excitation intensity and then saturated. The saturated values of ηUC were taken at 17 W cm−2 and are listed in Table 3.
The observed values of ηUC were 0.6–1%, the same order as the mixed cast film of unsubstituted rubrene (ηUC = 0.5% for PdTPTAP:Rb), although a significant increase in ΦFL was observed for all the rubrene derivatives in their pristine films (Table 1). This discrepancy suggested that ΦFL changes by adding the sensitizer. Actually, ΦFL of the mixed cast solid with doping PdTPTAP was much smaller (7–15%, Table 3) than the values of the pristine films (23–42%, Table 1). Thus, the sensitizer caused fluorescence quenching of the rubrene derivatives in the solid phase.
Spectral overlap
Förster-type energy transfer is a possible mechanism for the quenching by sensitizer-doping. However, only the spectral tail of fluorescence of the rubrene derivatives overlaps the absorption band of PdTPTAP. Thus, we calculated the overlap integral J between the fluorescence spectrum of the emitter and the absorption spectrum of the sensitizer (PdTPTAP) defined as 46 where F(λ) is the area normalized fluorescence spectrum and ε(λ) is the absorption spectrum in M−1 cm−1. The integral was done for wavelength λ in nm over the emission band. The obtained value was J = 1.2 × 1015 M−1 cm−1 nm4 for TBRb, and the similar values for the other rubrene derivatives (Fig. S12 in ESI†). These J values were comparable to the values of the known Förster-type energy transfer system (1013–1015 M−1 cm−1 nm4).46 The strong absorption of the sensitizer, contrary to the intuition, resulted in the large J values of the present systems. Therefore, the Förster-type energy transfer to the sensitizer could occur for these systems.
Fluorescence decay measurements
To investigate the mechanism of quenching by the sensitizer, the fluorescence decay measurements were conducted by exciting the emitter directly. Pristine TBRb (no sensitizer) showed dual-exponential decay with the lifetimes of τ1 = 7.4 ns (A1 = 94%) and τ2 = 28 ns (A2 = 6%), giving average lifetime  (Fig. S13, ESI†). The decay became faster by adding PdTPTAP and by increasing its concentration (Fig. 5a). At the highest sensitizer concentration of ([PdTPTAP]:[TBRb] = 1:200), the fluorescence was mostly quenched within a few nanoseconds. The decay curves of the mixed film were analyzed with using the theoretical model47 g(t) = g0exp(−αt − βt2),(2)where g(t) is defined as g(t) =N(t)/N0(t) with N(t) and N0(t) are the decay data of the mixed and pristine solid samples. The exponential constant α represents exciton-diffusion quenching and the stretched-exponential constant represents here the quenching by Förster-type energy transfer from the emitter to the sensitizer, i.e., back energy transfer (BET). The curve fits to the normalized decay curves g(t) (Fig. 5b) gave nonzero values for both α and β, suggesting that both Förster-type BET and exciton diffusion cause the quenching. The Förster radius estimated from the obtained β was R0 = 3.3 nm for the 1:2000 sample based on the relation47β = (4/3)πR03N(π/τ)1/2, where N is the number density of the sensitizer (N = 4.48 × 10−3 molecule nm−3), calculated from the molar concentration ratio of [PdTPTAP]:[TBRb] = 1:2000 and the number density of TBRb in the solid (0.896 molecule nm−3 = NAd/Mw where NA is Avogadro's number, density of TBRb (d = 1.127 g cm−3 from Table S1, ESI†) and its molecular weight (Mw = 757.12 g mol−1)). The average lifetime  = 11.3 ns of the solid TBRb (Fig. S13, ESI†) was used for τ. Thus, ∼150 molecules of TBRb are expected within R0 from the spherical volume (V0= (4/3)πR03) and the number density shown above. This number within R0 is ∼8% of all the TBRb molecules, which is not a negligible number.

Sensitizer concentration dependence of ΦFL and ηUC
From the results shown above, it was clarified that the fluorescence of the rubrene derivatives in the mixed film was quenched by the doped sensitizer through the BET mechanism. Thus, reducing the sensitizer concentration is a possible way to suppress it. We fabricated the mixed cast films by reducing the molar sensitizer-emitter ratio from [sensitizer]/[emitter] = 2 × 10−2 to 5 × 10−5, which is equivalent to [sensitizer]:[emitter] = 1:500 to 1:20000. As shown in Fig. 6a, the ΦFL of the mixed cast film was found to increase with decreasing sensitizer concentration for all the derivatives. The values at the lowest sensitizer concentration ([sensitizer]/[emitter] = 5 × 10−5) are close to those of the pristine films (i.e., [sensitizer]/[emitter] = 0) of the rubrene derivatives (Table 1), showing that the obtained results are consistent with each other.

The excitation intensity was 17 W cm−2 for all. (d) Upconversion emission from the most diluted PdTPTAP:TBRb film ([Sensitizer]:[Emitter] = 5 × 10−5 = 1:20000) by exciting from the right side (arrow) with 785 nm cw beam. 
We also measured ηUC of the mixed cast films with the rubrene derivatives for each sensitizer concentration at the saturation excitation intensity (Fig. 6b). For all rubrene derivatives, we found that ηUC showed the same trend as seen for ΦFL against the concertation ratio; the ηUC increased with decreasing sensitizer concentration. This trend clearly showed that ΦFL limits the observed ηUC. At the lowest concentration of the sensitizer ([sensitizer]/[emitter] = 5 × 10−5 or 1:20000), the ηUC reached its maximum value for each rubrene derivative, ηUC = (4.0 ± 0.3)% for TBRb, followed by (3.1 ± 0.5)% for DMeORb, and (2.7 ± 0.3)% for DOcORb. Even with such a low concentration ratio of the sensitizer, clear upconversion emission was observed by naked eye (Fig. 6d). These ηUC values are higher than the values previously reported for the systems with similar rubrene derivatives (ηUC = 0.4% for the binary solid with the tetra-tert-butyl-substituted rubrene with Pd-phthalocyanine sensitizer and singlet sink of DBP and 0.6% for that of the 80% emitter concentration in polystyrene).29 In particular, our best value with TBRb was even higher than that of the physically controlled system of the core separation of unsubstituted rubrene (ηUC = 2.4%)31 and comparable to the rubrene with the DBP system combined with the perovskite sensitizer (ηUC = 4.1 ± 0.3%).33 Thus, the obtained value for TBRb is the one of the best values for the solid system of NIR TTA-UC.
The same concentration-dependence experiments were repeated using unsubstituted rubrene (Rb) as the emitter, i.e., for the PdTPTAP:Rb film. In this case, the ΦFL was kept low at about 2–3%, irrespective of the sensitizer concentration (Fig. 6a, shown in black). This shows that SF, independent of the sensitizer concentration, is the dominant quenching process for the PdTPTAP:Rb film. Though the ΦFL slightly increases with decreasing sensitizer concentration, the change was almost negligible compared to the change from the solution to the solid (90% to ∼3%). Also, the ηUC did not show a significant change, depending on the concentration ratio (Fig. 6b, shown in black). This again shows that the ηUC with Rb is limited by the low ΦFL but is mainly governed by SF, unlike the cases of its derivatives where BET is the dominant deactivation channel.
The ηUC values mentioned above were all measured at the excitation intensity of 17 W cm−2. We also measured the excitation intensity dependence for all sensitizer concentrations to check their Ith values and to confirm that the applied excitation intensity can give a saturated value of ηUC. The observed Ith was found to increase with decreasing sensitizer concentration for all rubrene derivatives but they are still much lower than 17 W cm−2 (Fig. S14 in ESI†). Therefore, the obtained ηUC values in Fig. 6b can be regarded as the saturated values.
Dynamics of the upconversion emission
For a deeper understanding of the TTA-UC processes in the cast films with the rubrene derivatives, we investigated the dynamics of the UC emission using nanosecond laser-pulse excitation (duration of ∼10 ns, wavelength 800 nm) and detecting the wavelengths shorter than 700 nm (see Experimental for details). For all the samples, we observed that the UC emission is composed of the fast (in nanoseconds, Fig. 7) and slow (in microseconds, Fig. 8) components (see Fig. S15, ESI† for the overview for all time range). A similar response consisting of the fast and slow components was previously reported for the PdTPTAP:Rb film.22
 Fig. 7  Nanosecond time profiles of upconversion emission from the mixed cast solids (red solid curve) of (a) PdTPTAP:TBRb, (b) PdTPTAP:DMeORb, and (c) PdTPTAP:DOcORb, excited by nanosecond pulses at 800 nm (10 ns, 22 kW cm−2). The concentration ratio was [sensitizer]:[emitter] = 1:2000 = 5 × 10−4 for all. The results of convolution (pale blue dash-and-dotted curve) of the material response of the exponential decay time constant (τ = 20 ns) with the instrumental response function (black dotted curve) are also presented. 
 Fig. 8  Microsecond time profiles of upconversion emission from the mixed cast solids (red dots) of (a) PdTPTAP:TBRb, (b) PdTPTAP:DMeORb, and (c) PdTPTAP:DOcORb, excited by nanosecond pulses at 800 nm (10 ns, 22 kW cm−2). The concentration ratio was [sensitizer]:[emitter] = 1:2000 = 5 × 10−4 for all. Curve fitting with eqn (3) was shown by the black solid curve. The spikes due to the short component were not shown. 
For the nanosecond components, UC emission was built up within 10 ns and decayed before 40 ns (Fig. 7a–c). The presented data are for the samples with [sensitizer]/[emitter] = 5 × 10−4 = 1:2000. The results for the other concentrations were basically the same except for the gradual shift of the peak position and longer decays (at about 20–40 ns) with decreasing sensitizer concentration (Fig. S16a–c in ESI†). The responses were insensitive to the excitation intensity (Fig. S16d–f, ESI†). UC emission is delayed fluorescence, which occurs via the triplet state. Thus, these nanosecond responses are “very fast” and characteristic of the solid state. These response times were close to those of the prompt fluorescence induced by two-photon absorption (TPA) obtained for femtosecond laser pulse excitation of the pristine films using the same detection setup (Fig. S17 in ESI†). However, the longer time constant τ was needed for one to reproduce the UC emission responses (τ = 20 ns for all, blue dash-and-dotted curve, Fig. 7a–c) compared to the prompt fluorescence by TPA (τ = 4–5 ns, Fig. S17a–c in ESI†). These reproduced data were obtained by convoluting the material response, the impulsive rise, followed by the single exponential decay with time constant τ, against the instrumental response function (IRF). Moreover, the nanosecond excitation of the cast film of the rubrene derivatives without a sensitizer did not give any emission (Fig. S18 in ESI†). These facts solidified that the fast response in the nanoseconds was due to UC emission and no prompt fluorescence induced by TPA was contaminated. Since the assumption of the impulsive excitation allowed the reasonable reproduction of the observed responses (Fig. 7a–c), the rise time constant of UC emission is much faster than the detection system's response. Thus, we can say that the rise time constants were shorter than the respective decay time constants (20 ns). Based on this discussion, the TET time constants of the fast component were estimated to be τfastTET < 40 ns (Table S2, ESI†) because the TET time constant is twice the time constant of the UC emission rise.35
For the longer, microsecond component, the appearance of the responses differed depending on the rubrene derivatives (Fig. 8a–c, data shown for the same concentration ratio). It should be noted here that a slow rise was observed for all in this time scale, which was not seen in the previous result with unsubstituted rubrene.22 The amplitude of the slow rise component depended on the rubrene derivatives and different concentration ratios (Fig. S19a–c in ESI†).
The behavior of the UC emission time profiles seems to be complex, but we found that all the data can be consistently reproduced with the following single model function, (3)where K is the instrumental constant, A is the amplitude of the decay-only component, B is the amplitude of the rise-and-decay component, τR is the rise time constant of the emitter triplet population, τD is the decay time constant of the emitter triplet population via the first-order deactivation channel (so-called triplet decay time of emitter), and f = k2/(k3E + k2) is the ratio of the decay via the second-order deactivation channel to the sum via all the decay channels (here, only the first- and second-order deactivation channels are considered) where k3E and k2 are the first- and second-order rate constants, respectively, of the emitter triplet decay channels. Eqn (3) is based on the exponential rise and decay, (1 − e−t/τR)e−t/τD of the emitter triplet population generated via TET, and the UC emission intensity is proportional to the square of the population.35 However, it is expanded to also consider the decay-only component, which is the fast component with very fast TET, with the amplitude A and the second-order deactivation (via TTA) channel represented by the Bachilo–Weisman type decay function48 (1 − f)/(et/τD − f). Thus, when f = 0 (non-exponential fast decay is not observed), eqn (3) reduced to the exponential rise and decay model with the decay-only component, IUC(t) = K{[A + B(1 − e−t/τR)]e−t/τD}2.
The results of the curve fitting with eqn (3) are shown in Fig. 8 with black curves for [sensitizer]:[emitter] = 1:2000 and also in Fig. S19 in ESI† for all concentration ratios. The best fit parameters are summarized in Table S2 in ESI.† Both A and B were found to be nonzero. The slow rise time constants were obtained to be τR = 7–20 μs for TBRb, 1–2 μs for DMeORb, and 3–5 μs for DOcORb, depending on the concentration ratios. The decay time constants, i.e., triplet decay time of the emitters, were τD = 90–100 μs for TBRb, 40–140 μs for DMeORb, and 110–200 μs for DOcORb.
With the data of the UC emission dynamics presented above, we estimated the TET quantum yield, ΦTET, for the mixed films. In the present case, the fast and slow TET's existed, as shown above, as the decay-only and slow-rise components, weighted as A and B, respectively. The time constant of the fast TET (τfastTET) was discussed above. For the slow TET, the time constant was calculated from the relation, τslowTET = (τR−1 + τD−1)−1.35 Then, the average time constant of these fast and slow TET time constants was calculated using the amplitudes of the fast and slow rise components (A and B) as 46 with i, j = 1,2, A1 = A, τ1 = τfastTET, A2 = B, τ2 = τslowTET. Finally, the TET quantum yield was estimated from the relation, ΦTET = 1 − τ/τ0,35 where τ is the triplet lifetime of sensitizer with TET, here replaced with τTET and τ0 is the triplet lifetime of sensitizer without TET, reported to be 16.2 μs for PdTPTAP.22 The estimated values of τTET were faster than a few microseconds and then they gave ΦTET values of 80–100%, as shown in Table S2 (ESI†).
Estimation of the TTA quantum yield ΦTTA
It is widely accepted that the ηUC can be factorized into the product of the quantum yields of the processes consisting of the overall TTA-UC as ηUC = ΦISC ΦTET ΦTTA ΦFL, where ΦISC, ΦTET, and ΦTTA are the quantum yields of the ISC, TET, and TTA processes, respectively. In this representation, the ratio of the generated emitter triplets deactivating through the bimolecular channel, known as the normalized UC quantum yield Θ35 or the fraction of generated annihilator triplets that undergo second-order decay f2,3,49 is implicitly included in ΦTTA. For the saturated ηUC, Θ = f2 ≈ 1, and it reduces to ΦTTA ≈ φs, where φs is the singlet branching ratio, defined as the ratio of the number of the excited singlet emitter formed via TTA to the number of the triplet pairs consumed. Here, we use the saturated ηUC values for discussion; thus, ΦTTA can be replaced with φs. Therefore, ηUC/ΦFL= ΦISC ΦTETφs gives the estimation of φs if both ΦISC and ΦTET are known.
The value of ηUC/ΦFL for the mixed films of the rubrene derivatives with different concentration are shown in Fig. 6c. Although the values fluctuate to some degree, they are rather independent of the concentration. This is because the rates of ISC, TET, and TTA are independent of the sensitizer concentration. Please recall that ΦISC is the property of sensitizer, and the value of PdTPTAP was known to be unity ΦISC ≈ 1.22 Meanwhile, ΦTET was close to unity, as estimated in the previous section. If we corrected with the estimated values of ΦTET in Table S2 (ESI†), ηUC/(ΦFLΦTET) did not change significantly from the ηUC/ΦFL values (Fig. S20 in ESI†). Therefore, the relation is reduced to ηUC/ΦFL ≈ φs, and the vertical axis of Fig. 6c can be understood as the estimated singlet branching ratio through this relation.

Fig. 6c shows that the mixed cast film with the rubrene derivatives tend to have lower φs (mostly 7–15%) than that of unsubstituted rubrene (10–25%), though the values are scattered depending on the concentration. The φs value for unsubstituted rubrene agreed with the reported value, 33% in toluene solution,3 36% in cast solid,22 but it was higher than the value of 16%.50 The lower φs values for the rubrene derivatives than unsubstituted rubrene shows that the bulky substitution also affects, not only SF, but also TTA and made the TTA process less efficient, as expected. This tendency agrees with the results from another group.50
By looking closely, DMeORb and TBRb tend to have higher value of φs (up to 15%) than DOcORb (7–9%), although the value fluctuated depending on the concentration ratio. These facts suggest that the longer chain makes the core–core distance wider and inhibits TTA more than the others. This suggests that the moderate size of the substituent has the potential for high UC efficiency.
Conclusion
We report on the fluorescence and TTA-UC properties of the cast solid of three rubrene derivatives, including two new structures, with bulky substituents in different positions (in the tetracene core and in the peripheral phenyl groups). For the pristine films, the rubrene derivatives showed 10 folds increase in ΦFL compared to that of unsubstituted rubrene, suggesting the suppression of SF by bulky substituents. However, this increase did not result in the enhancement of ηUC. All rubrene derivatives showed UC emission in their cast films by doping PdTPTAP as the sensitizer in the molar ratio of [sensitizer]:[emitter] = 1:2000; the values of ηUC were in the same order of that of unsubstituted rubrene.
It was found that the sensitizer quenched the emitter fluorescence by BET via the Förster-type mechanism. The dependences of ΦFL and ηUC on sensitizer concentration revealed that they show similar trends to each other for the rubrene derivatives but not for unsubstituted rubrene. This can be understood as follows: after suppressing the SF quenching of the emitter fluorescence, the BET quenching became dominant for the rubrene derivatives.
By diluting more to the sensitizer-to-emitter ratio of 1:20000, BET quenching was suppressed, and the ηUC values reached their maximum values. Especially for TBRb, it showed ηUC = 4.0%, the highest class of the reported values of NIR TTA-UC in the solid. This was achieved by simple casting methods without singlet sink. The obtained cast film showed upconverted emission clearly visible to naked eye even with the least sensitizer-to-emitter ratio, as shown in Fig. 6d. A careful consideration of the UC emission dynamics concluded that the fast and slow TET's exist and the ΦTET was close to unity. This showed that the singlet branching ratio of TTA φs can be approximated by ηUC/ΦFL for these systems. The estimated φs showed that the TTA process was diminished by the introduction of the bulky substituents.
Since both SF and TTA are based on the electron-exchange mechanism, suppressing SF by separating the intermolecular distance is accompanied with diminishing TTA. However, an important conclusion of the present results is that they are not totally counterbalanced. The better condition for efficient TTA-UC can be found by the introduction of bulky groups, which is consistent with the previous works.21,51 We have demonstrated this by obtaining the highest-class values of ηUC with the rubrene derivatives. This was achieved by lowering the sensitizer concentration and thus by suppressing the BET, which masked the improvements. In the solid state, the sensitizer concentration can be set lower than that in the solution because of the high density of chromophores and faster intermolecular interaction in the solid, as found in the nanosecond TET process. The drawbacks of the dilution are the low capturing efficiency of the photon because of the low absorbance and the increase in the threshold excitation intensity. The former can be compensated by increasing the thickness of the films. On the other hand, no simple solution for the latter exists. Further studies on the control on the triplet lifetime will open the way.
In the presented work, singlet sink such as DBP was not used to increase the ΦFL. Even without using it, we achieved high ηUC comparable to the system using the singlet sink. However, our approach of introducing a bulky substituent and diluting the sensitizer is not inconsistent with the singlet sink approach but rather assist it. The FL (of emitter fluorescence), SF, and BET (Fig. 1) are competing deactivation processes with singlet–singlet energy transfer to the singlet sink as the deactivation channel of the excited singlet state of the emitter (1E*) generated by TTA. Therefore, suppressing both the SF and BET by our approach further enhances the efficiency of the energy-transfer channel to the singlet sink, which may open a way to overcome the limitation facing the singlet sink approach.
