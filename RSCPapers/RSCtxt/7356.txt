    AbstractSupramolecular donor–acceptor assemblies composed of carbon nanodiamond (ND) and porphyrin (Por) are constructed through interensemble hydrogen bonding and π–π interactions. Formation of the supramolecular clusters composed of ND and porphyrin has been confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and IR spectroscopy. The resulting supramolecular clusters have been assembled as three-dimensional arrays onto nanostructured SnO2 films using an electrophoretic deposition method for the test of photoelectrochemical properties. Enhancement in the photoelectrochemical performance as well as the broader photoresponse in the visible region is seen with formation of the supramolecular clusters between ND and porphyrins as compared with the reference system without porphyrins.
Introduction
Nanocarbon materials (fullerene, carbon nanotube, carbon nano-onion, etc.) presently attract much attention as prospective technological materials. They constitute a major part of the emerging field of nanoscience and nanotechnology.1–5 In particular, functionalized nanocarbon materials with an electron donor moiety have been expected to lead to the construction of a novel electron donor–acceptor composite system for the development of light-energy conversion systems, such as photoelectrochemical and photovoltaic cells.6 There have been many examples of covalent and noncovalent functionalization of nanocarbons with light-harvester and/or electron donor molecules such as porphyrin and phthalocyanine derivatives.6–12 However, developing donor–acceptor assemblies based on nanocarbon materials has remained a major challenge because of difficulties in the size and shape control of the nanocarbon architectures. This inhomogeneous size distribution causes an inefficient electron injection to the solar-cell electrode.
In this context, a carbon nanodiamond (ND) merits special attention as an alternative nanocarbon architecture to develop the novel electron donor–acceptor composite. Carbon nanodiamond can be produced either as a thin film using chemical vapor deposition techniques or as a powder by the detonation of carbon-containing explosives such as trinitrotoluene and hexogen in a steel chamber.13–15 A typical ND has ca. 5 nm average diamond particle size and unique nanostructure containing sp2 and sp3 carbon atoms.16 Due to a large number of unsatisfied surface atoms and a large surface/volume ratio, ND exhibits a very high surface reactivity compared to that of other nanocarbon materials. Recently, there have been many reports on the applications and theoretical calculations for designing a novel nanocomposite material based on ND.17–22 However, the construction of the electron donor–acceptor composite based on carbon nanodiamonds and their electron-accepting ability have yet to be scrutinized.
Herein, we report for the first time the construction of a donor–acceptor composite based on carbon nanodiamond as an electron acceptor. Notably, a hydrogen-bond formation between each carboxylate group has been successfully utilized to favor supramolecular complexation between ND and the porphyrin moiety. We have also investigated the photodynamics and photoelectrochemical properties of ND–porphyrin composite system by using a variety of spectroscopic techniques and photoelectrochemical measurements. The ND–porphyrin composite system enables one to achieve the supramolecular complexation of ND composite, paving a new way to use ND as an electron acceptor for developing a donor–acceptor composite system.
Experimental section
General information
Absorption spectra were recorded using a Varian CARY50 Bio UV–visible spectrophotometer. Emission spectra were recorded on an SLM 8000 photon counting spectrofluorimeter. Thermogravimetric analyses were performed using a EXSTAR TG/DTA 7200 model (SII Nanotechnology Inc.). IR spectra of solid samples were recorded on a Thermo Nicolet NEXUS 870 FT-IR instrument using 2 cm−1 standard resolution at ambient temperature by KBr wafers containing ca. 1% of the sample.
Materials
All solvents and chemicals were of reagent grade quality, obtained commercially and used without further purification unless otherwise noted. Carbon nanodiamond in the present study was provided by NanoCarbon Research Institute Co. Ltd., Japan. It was purified and annealed according to the previously reported procedure.16 Nanostructured SnO2 films were cast on an optically transparent electrode (OTE) by applying a 2% colloidal solution obtained from Alfa Chemicals. The air-dried films were annealed at 673 K. The nanostructured SnO2 film electrode is referred to as OTE/SnO2.23
Preparation of carbon nanodiamond attached with porphyrins
Typical preparation procedures of ND–TCPP composite are described as follows. ND (1 mg) and tetrakis(p-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (TCPP, 10 mg) were suspended in acetonitrile (MeCN). The mixture was treated by mild sonication for 2 h. The resulting suspension was centrifuged for 60 min at 10000 rpm. After the centrifugation, the precipitate was repeatedly washed by MeCN, to remove unattached TCPP molecules, until a clear solution was obtained, and then, the residual solid was collected.
Transmission electron microscopy
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were collected on a HITACHI model H-800 transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. TEM samples were prepared by depositing a drop of dispersion on carbon-coated copper grids (250 mesh).
Dynamic light scattering measurements
Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were performed using a Zetasizer Nano S (Malvern Instruments Ltd., USA). The DLS instrument used in this study has a range between 0.6 and 6000 nm, and thereby any structures over this limit cannot be detected.
Fluorescence lifetime measurements
Fluorescence lifetime measurements were performed on a FluoroCube (Horiba Jobin Yvon, formerly IBH product) with a 373 nm LED excitation source by a time-correlated single photon counting method. The fluorescence signal was detected in magic angle polarization using a TBX-04 picosecond photon-detection module. The fluorescence decay curves were further analyzed by using the IBH software library.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
Photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out in a standard three-compartment cell consisting of a working electrode, a Pt wire gauze counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. This configuration allowed us to perform photocurrent measurements under electrochemical bias. All other photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out in a standard two-compartment cell consisting of a working electrode and a Pt gauge counter electrode with a Keithley model 617 programmable electrometer. The electrolyte was 0.5 mol dm−3 LiI and 0.01 mol dm−3 I2 in acetonitrile. A collimated light beam from a 150 W xenon lamp with a 390 nm cut-off filter was used for excitation of ND or ND–TCPP composite on OTE/SnO2 electrodes. A Bausch and Lomb high-intensity grating monochromator was introduced into the path of the excitation beam at the selected wavelength.
Results and discussion
Formation of supramolecular cluster composed of carbon nanodiamond and a porphyrin
The structural changes of ND by the formation of supramolecular clusters between ND and TCPP are clearly seen in the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images in Fig. 1. The aggregated structure of pristine ND (Fig. 1a) is well-dispersed as small clusters after coating with TCPP (Fig. 1b). Furthermore, we have also examined the size distributions of pristine ND and TCPP-coated ND in MeCN by dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements. DLS in MeCN (Fig. 2) reveals that TCPP-coated ND affords a narrow size distribution, with a mean size of 86 ± 34 nm, which is smaller than pristine ND (208 ± 84 nm).24 The aggregates of ND may be broken as a result of its interaction with TCPP.

Spectroscopic evidence for the interensemble interaction between ND and TCPP was obtained by IR spectroscopy. The comparison of the IR spectra of ND–TCPP, TCPP, and pristine ND revealed the attachment of the porphyrin units to ND, because the CO vibrations of the terminal carboxylate group on the attached porphyrin units are slightly shifted and broadened with a formation of supramolecular clusters (Fig. 3).25 This result suggests a supramolecular assembly formation between ND and TCPP by hydrogen bonding through a terminated carboxylate group.

The amount of porphyrin groups attached to ND was determined by the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under a nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 as shown in Fig. 4, with a gradual weight loss between 150 and 600 °C. The decompositions in the temperature ranges 150–460 °C and 460–600 °C were assigned to porphyrins and ND, and thus the weight of porphyrins attached to the nanodiamonds is determined to be ca. 14%.

Preparation and photophysical properties of ND–TCPP nanocluster film
The ND–TCPP nanoclusters were assembled as a thin film on SnO2-cast optically transparent electrode (OTE/SnO2) using an electrophoretic deposition technique.26 ND–TCPP clusters solution in MeCN was transferred to a 1 cm cuvette in which the OTE/SnO2 electrode and a counter electrode (another OTE) were kept at a distance of 6 mm with a Teflon spacer. A direct current–voltage (200 V cm−1) was applied between the electrodes using a Fluke 415 power supply. The deposition of the film can be monitored visibly as the ND–TCPP clusters are driven to the electrode and the solution becomes colorless. The OTE/SnO2 electrode coated with ND–TCPP film is referred to as OTE/SnO2/ND–TCPP. Reference compound electrodes (OTE/SnO2/TCPP and OTE/SnO2/ND) were also prepared in the same manner.
We have examined the UV–visible absorption spectra of ND–TCPP composite film (OTE/SnO2/ND–TCPP) and reference compound films (OTE/SnO2/TCPP and OTE/SnO2/ND) as shown in Fig. 5. The absorption of ND–TCPP (Fig. 5a) in the film agrees well with that of TCPP (Fig. 5b) and ND (Fig. 5c). Notably, the Soret band of a porphyrin in the ND–TCPP absorption affords ca. 5 nm red shift as compared to that of TCPP. This indicates that there are π–π interactions between attached porphyrins on the nanodiamond surface and/or between porphyrin and nanodiamond sp2 carbons.27

The photophysical properties of TCPP and ND–TCPP films were investigated by the steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy. Photoexcitation of TCPP and ND–TCPP films at 422 nm results in similar fluorescence emission patterns maximized at 655 nm, and reveals notable fluorescence quenching (∼80%) of porphyrins on ND–TCPP composite (Fig. 6A).28

Time-resolved fluorescence measurements further confirmed the electronic interactions between photoexcited TCPP and ND. The fluorescence time profiles of TCPP and ND–TCPP at 655 nm and their kinetic parameters are shown in Fig. 6B and Table 1. The fluorescence decay of TCPP was well fitted by a biexponential curve including short-lived and long-lived components, from which the fluorescence lifetimes were determined as 0.29 ns and 3.28 ns, respectively. The short-lived components may be caused by the direct electron transfer from singlet excited TCPP to SnO2. The lifetime of long-lived component is comparable to the fluorescence lifetimes of meso-substituted porphyrins.29 In contrast, the fluorescence decay of ND–TCPP was best fitted by a multi-exponential function including short-lived and long-lived components. The lifetimes of short-lived components were determined as 0.13 and 0.53 ns, both of which are much shorter than that of TCPP fluorescence. These short-lived decays may be caused by the charge separation in the ND–TCPP nanocluster and direct photoinduced electron transfer from porphyrin to SnO2. A possible rationale of the long-lived component may come from the supramolecular formation on a redox-inactive carbon edge, in which the photoexcited TCPP does not interact with ND. Thus, the short fluorescence lifetime and an efficient fluorescence quenching of ND–TCPP, as compared to TCPP, may result from intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer from the singlet excited state of TCPP (1TCPP*) to ND in the ND–TCPP supramolecular clusters (eqn (1) and (2)). (1) ND–1TCPP→ND(e−)–1TCPP*(2)

Photoelectrochemical properties of ND–TCPP nanocluster film
We have also tested the photoelectrochemical perfomance of ND–TCPP nanocluster electrodes. Fig. 7 shows incident photon-photocurrent efficiency (IPCE) of ND–TCPP nanocluster film electrode (OTE/SnO2/ND–TCPP) and reference compound film electrodes. The IPCE value of the ND–TCPP film exhibits a remarkable increase with the formation of supramolecular cluster between ND and TCPP. In particular, the ND–TCPP system has the maximum IPCE value of 8% at 500 nm under a bias potential (+0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl), as well as a broad photoresponse extending into the infrared region up to 750 nm. Such an effective light-energy conversion may be caused by the three-dimensional supramolecular clusterization between ND and porphyrins and/or π–π interactions between porphyrins on the ND surface.

The photocurrent and photovoltage responses recorded upon excitation of the OTE/SnO2/ND–TCPP electrode with visible light (λ > 390 nm) are shown in Fig. 8a and b, respectively. These responses are steady and reproducible during repeated on/off cycles of the visible light illumination. The open circuit voltage (VOC) is 165 mV, and the short circuit photocurrent density (ISC) is 0.031 mA cm−2 under unbiased conditions at an incident light intensity of 10 mW cm−2.30 Blank experiments conducted with OTE/SnO2 electrode (i.e. by excluding ND–TCPP) produced no detectable photocurrent under similar experimental conditions. The slower decay in photovoltage response is because of a slow charge recombination process after the photoinduced charge separation.

The current–voltage characteristics of ND–TCPP modified films are presented in Fig. 9. The photocurrent increased as the applied potential was scanned towards more-positive potentials. Increased charge separation and the facile transport of charge carriers under positive bias are responsible for enhanced photocurrent generation. At potentials greater than +0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl, direct electrochemical oxidation of iodide interfered with the photocurrent measurement. The observed current was a maximum when the applied anodic bias facilitated the charge separation and charge transport within the film. The ND–TCPP assembly exhibited superior performance in delivering higher photocurrent as compared to the reference system without TCPP.

Photocurrent generation mechanism
The photoinduced electron transfer process from TCPP to ND might be explained by one or both of the following possibilities. One possibility is that the excited state of TCPP donates the electron to the conduction band of ND (Fig. 10a). Redox potentials of each component [i.e. the oxidation potential (Eox) of TCPP and the one-electron reduction potential (Ered) of ND] have been determined to be Eox = 1.12 V and Ered = −0.21 V vs. SCE, respectively.31,32 The singlet excited state energy of TCPP was also estimated as 1.90 eV from the average wavelength between absorption and fluorescence maxima. Considering these potentials, we approximate the driving force of charge separation (−ΔGCS) and charge recombination (−ΔGCR) to be −ΔGCS = 0.57 eV and −ΔGCR = 1.33 eV, respectively. Thus, these free-energy changes indicate that photoinduced electron transfer and charge recombination reaction in the ND–TCPP nanohybrid are thermodynamically favorable. Another possibility would involve initial exciton formation on ND (Fig. 10b). Indeed, the photocurrent response in the visible region, as shown in Fig. 7, suggests another pathway for the photocurrent generation process (i.e. the formation of exciton by the direct photoexcitation of semiconducting ND). In any case, ND accepts electrons from TCPP to produce the charge-separated state, which then provides accepted electrons to the electrode for the photocurrent generation.

Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully constructed the first supramolecular donor–acceptor assemblies based on carbon nanodiamonds and porphyrins for photoinduced electron transfer and photo-energy conversion. This composite system shows an efficient photocurrent response in the visible light region as compared with the reference system, because of the effective electron transfer from the photoexcited porphyrin to the carbon nanodiamonds. The usefulness of such a nanodiamond-based cluster system provides a new strategy of developing more efficient photo-energy conversion system, by modifying the supramolecular structures.

As indicated in above reference, the surface CO stretching frequencies are shifted with formation of hydrogen bond and/or changing the nanodiamond particle size.
The electrophoretic deposition method has
previously been utilized to cast a thin film of nanocarbon-based clusters on a nanostructured SnO2 electrode. See references:

Each film electrode (OTE/SnO2/ND–TCPP and OTE/SnO2/TCPP) contains the same amount of porphyrin by adjusting the initial porphyrin concentration (estimated from the weight ratio) of a solution for the electrophoretic deposition.

An incident light was adjusted at relatively low intensity (10 mW cm−2) as compared with that of a previous report to prevent the decomposition of the nanostructured films.

As indicated in ref. 15, the energy of the valence band of carbon-cage structure (model of carbon nanodiamond) was estimated by AM1 calculations and solid X-ray emission spectroscopy in the range of −6 to 10 eV. The HOMO energy of TCPP was also determined as −5.56 eV by UV photoelectron spectroscopy (  T. Ma, K. Inoue, H. Noma, K. Yao and E. Abe, J. Mater. Sci. Lett., 2002, 21, 1013 Search PubMed  ). Judging from these energy levels, the valence band of nanodiamond is located below porphyrin HOMO level.
