    , Accepted 24th January 2019First published on 24th January 2019AbstractIn the last few years, organic–inorganic halide perovskites (OIHP) have gained significant attention in the optoelectronics community and become one of the most popular research topics. Due to their fascinating properties, including wide-range tunable band gap, long charge carrier diffusion length, high absorption coefficient, and easy solution processability, they have become one of the most promising classes of low-cost and easily scalable semiconductor materials for application in various optoelectronic devices such as solar cells, photodetectors, and light-emitting diodes. To achieve the best performance and viable technologies for future energy harvesting, display and light sensing prototypes, in addition to the OHIP active layer, the use of interfacial charge transporting layers is crucial. These interfacial charge-transporting layers not only enhance the performance of optoelectronic devices but also effectively protect the active environmentally unstable OHIP layer. In this review, we summarize the development and utilization of organic interfacial materials and OIHP in solar cells, photodetectors and light-emitting diodes. In each section, the working principle and the development of a wide range of hole/electron transporting materials are discussed. Finally, an outlook and further research directions as well as useful rules for the design of novel hole/electron transporting materials are proposed.

Broader context
Organic–inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP)-based optoelectronic devices, which include solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and photodetectors are expected to play an extremely important role in future flexible and printed electronics and can create new applications in the near future. OIHP is one of the most promising classes of low-cost and easily scalable semiconducting active materials, which can be used in various electronic devices. OHIP exhibit outstanding properties including long charge carrier diffusion length, high absorption coefficient, wide-range tunable band gap, and easy solution processability. To harness the OHIP technology for use in devices, there is a great need for interfacial charge transporting layers since they not only boost the performance but also protect the unstable OIHP active layer from degrading in the working environment. In this review, we discuss the molecular and device engineering, optoelectronic properties, and recent research progress in the design of organic interfacial materials for use with OIHP materials in light harvesting, light detection, and display technology.

1 Introduction
Organic–inorganic halide perovskites (OIHP) with the ABX3 structure [where A is CH3NH3+, (NH2)2CH+, Cs or Rb, B is Pb2+ or Sn2+, and X is Cl−, Br− or I−, as shown in Fig. 1],1 have emerged as promising semiconductor materials for next generation high-performance optoelectronic devices due to their superior optical and electrical properties. Some of their salient features such as wide-range tunable band gap, long charge carrier diffusion length, high molar absorptivity, and easy solution processability make perovskites ideal candidates as active layers in photovoltaic,2–6 light-emitting diode,7–9 and photodetector devices (Fig. 2).10–12

Perovskite-based optoelectronic devices can be fabricated using several functional layers, including photoactive layers (light absorbers or emitters), interfacial layers, electrodes, and encapsulation films. Basically, the charge carriers generated in the photoactive layers are transported through the interfacial layers within the built-in electrical field and finally collected by electrodes in photovoltaics and photodetectors.13,14 In light-emitting diodes, the charge carriers injected through the electrodes are transported through interfacial layers to the perovskite emitter, where they are confined to undergo radiative recombination via electron–hole (exciton) recombination.15 Accordingly, interfacial layers with excellent charge extraction/injection capability are crucial to enhance the performance of optoelectronic devices. The properties of these layers need to be matched with that of other functional layers to realize functional interfaces.13,16–19 In general, an ideal interfacial material should meet the following requirements: (1) high charge carrier mobility, (2) energy levels well-aligned with that of the active perovskite layer and with the work function of the electrode, (3) good photo and thermal stability, (4) easy film formation and seamless interface with the other layers, and (5) low cost.20,21 Recently, different types of interfacial materials have been used in perovskite-based optoelectronic devices including inorganic,22–24 organic25–27 and carbon-based28,29 materials. Among them, inorganic and carbon-based interfacial materials with good conductivity and low-cost have proven to be effective interfacial materials. However, the limited selectivity and poor optoelectronic performance of inorganic and carbon interfacial materials hinder their wide application.30–32 Organic interfacial materials with tunable highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) can be obtained through controlled chemical synthesis or modification, resulting in energy levels well-aligned with those of perovskites and excellent optoelectronic performance.33–35 For example, in perovskite solar cells, the record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.1% certified by Newport Corp. in 2017 was achieved using PTAA (poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine]), an organic hole transporting interfacial material.3 In perovskite-based light-emitting diodes, the highest external quantum efficiency reached was 11.7% with TFB [poly(9,9-dioctyl-fluorene-co-N-(4-butylphenyl)diphenylamine)], an organic hole-injection interfacial layer.36 Obviously, the use of organic interfacial materials with high carrier mobility and excellent charge extraction/injection capability significantly enhances the performance of perovskite-based optoelectronic devices.
In this review, we summarize recent advances in organic interfacial materials for improving the performance of perovskite-based optoelectronic devices, including photovoltaics, photodetectors, and light-emitting diodes. Related organometallic materials are also reviewed. Finally, we give a brief outlook of the challenges and prospects for the future development of organic interfacial materials.
2 Perovskite solar cells
Applications of OIHP in optoelectronic devices were initially investigated in the early 1990s.37,38 Recently, they have been employed in several optoelectronic and electronic devices, including thin-film transistors,38 lasers,39,40 ambipolar transistors,41,42 solar cells,43,44 light-emitting diodes,45 and flexible memory46 due to their outstanding properties, including long charge carrier diffusion lengths, highly efficient ambipolar charge transport ability, wide optical absorption, and large absorption coefficients.1,47,48 Besides the applications of perovskite active layer thin films in various devices, research on perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has gained much attention in the scientific community due to the ability of this type of cell to achieve performance close to that of existing high-performance silicon- and other inorganic material-based solar cell technologies.
Miyasaka and colleagues initially attempted to use perovskite structures, including methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3 or MAPbI3) and methylammonium lead bromide (CH3NH3PbBr3 or MAPbBr3) as light-harvesting layers (sensitizers) in dye-synthesized solar cells (DSSCs) in 2009.49 The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) reported was around 3.8% with an iodide/triiodide based redox shuttle and liquid electrolyte. In 2011, Park and co-workers enhanced the PCE of the liquid-based MAPbI3 solar cell to 6.5% under standard AM 1.5G irradiation by modifying the titania surface and the processing method for the deposition of the perovskite.50 However, these initially reported devices were not stable and they degraded swiftly because the perovskite compound dissolved in liquid electrolytes.51 Subsequently, a significant breakthrough was achieved with the use of solid-state PSCs, independently developed by the groups of Snaith and Grätzel in 2012. The authors used MAPbI3−xClx and MAPbI3 as the active layer materials deposited onto a mesoporous TiO2 layer in conjunction with a hole transport layer (HTL), spiro-OMeTAD, resulting in PCEs of 7.6% and 9.7%, respectively.52,53 In less than eight years, the highest conversion efficiencies of PSCs have surged to 23.3% in 2018.54 The improvement in the perovskite solar cell efficiency over time is summarized in Fig. 3.

2.1 Working principle
There are three common device architectures of PSCs reported in the literature, as shown in Fig. 4a. They are divided into mesoporous structures, planar conventional/regular (n–i–p) structures and planar inverted (p–i–n) structures. The basic working principles are quite similar among the different architectures. The operating principles of PSCs have been investigated thoroughly in recent years.1,61–66 The perovskite layer is the most important active layer of the PSC device, which is sandwiched between electron and hole transporting layers, as illustrated in Fig. 4b. Upon irradiation of the perovskite layer by light, excitons (hole–electron pairs) are generated. Unlike organic photovoltaics (OPV), in which the exciton binding energy is very large (from hundreds of meV to more than 1 eV), the exciton binding energy in the perovskite is relatively small (only tens of meV), and hence direct generation of free charges dominates the conversion process from photon to photocurrent in PSC. Moreover, the free carriers generated within the perovskite can travel distances up to microns and hence they can reach the respective electrodes very effectively thanks to the long diffusion length of both electrons and holes in OIHP. This is in contrast to OPV, where excitons can travel up to only few tens of nm, thus the chances of recombination before charge separation are much higher, necessitating the use of bulk heterojunctions. Due to the combination of efficient charge transport and high extinction coefficient, PSCs can achieve high conversion efficiencies even in planar configurations. These properties also make PSCs a good thin-film technology competing with direct band gap inorganic materials and represent major advantages over silicon. Upon separation of charges, electrons move towards the anode (FTO-coated glass or ITO-coated glass), whereas holes move through a transporting material to the cathode (silver or gold) in devices.62,67 The amount of electrical energy generated is proportional to the number of photogenerated charges (external quantum efficiency) and the potential difference between the anode and the cathode is the voltage. The voltage depends on energy losses due to useful (charge separation at the interfaces) as well as detrimental (band relaxation and Fermi level drop due to recombination within the layer and at the interfaces) charge transfer processes.

2.2 Hole transporting materials (HTM)
Generally, a perovskite solar cell device includes five fundamental layers: a cathode, hole transporting layer (HTL), perovskite layer, electron transporting layer (ETL), and anode, as displayed in Fig. 4. Among the different layers, the HTL, where the extraction of photogenerated holes from the perovskite takes place so that these positive charges can be transported to the cathode, plays a key role in enhancing the PCE and reaching high stability in both the regular (n–i–p) and inverted (p–i–n) architectures.68–73 Indeed, the HTL is vital for improving the stability of the device because it protects the perovskite layer from the penetration of moisture/oxygen through the electrode or HTL itself.48,74–76 This is the major bottleneck on the way to commercialization of PSCs; therefore, HTL development is probably key to resolving this issue. Moreover, a higher PCE can be achieved with an HTL owning to its role in suppressing charge recombination and blocking electron movement.48,74,77 Particularly, in addition to their role in charge extraction, HTLs are important in inverted layouts because the growth of perovskite on top of the HTL layer governs the device performance and also influences the perovskite thin film formation.70
In general, the energy level of any novel HTMs for PSCs is a significant design parameter. Although the LUMO/CBM of the HTM is considerably higher than the CBM of perovskites to prevent photoexcited electron transport towards the cathode, the importance of the calculated and experimental ionization potential (IP) and HOMO/VBM of the HTM is still a matter of debate. Some previous reports showed that these values for the HTM should be aligned with and slightly higher than that of the perovskite layer for efficient hole extraction with minimal voltage loss, leading to an improved Voc.68,78–81 On the contrary, other research works indicated that the variation in the HOMO of HTMs does not drastically affect the device performance, particularly in terms of the Voc improvement.82,83 Therefore, even though the HOMO value may not be one of the top criteria when designing new HTMs, newly developed HTM materials must possess good solubility in common organic solvents, show high thermal stability, and be amorphous in nature and hydrophobic. Moreover, research on boosting the PCE of devices via novel HTMs should focus on the influence on the perovskite morphology when the HTL is deposited on top of it. For instance, the HTM should provide uniform, smooth and continuous films covering the perovskite surface without pinholes, resulting in more efficient hole transport and higher charge extraction efficiency in PSCs.81,84–86 In addition, selecting a proper deposition/fabrication method is critical for achieving a pinhole-free thin film morphology, smooth film and well-controlled crystal shape.84,87,88
Basically, there are two types of materials employed in the HTL of perovskite solar cells, organic and inorganic compounds. Although there are several recently developed organic and inorganic HTMs, organic HTMs are promising due to their potential applications in large-area printed solar panels.89 They also provide the advantage of simple preparation and manipulation.62,67 In addition, their properties can be tuned through chemical synthesis using a vast variety of building blocks.67 Furthermore, inorganic HTMs, which are deposited by solution processes, require high-temperature sintering after deposition, whereas organic materials can be fabricated at low temperature either by vacuum or solution processing, which better preserves the underlying perovskite material.90,91 Furthermore, the efficiency of PSCs using organic HTMs, including small molecules, polymers and organometallic compounds, is the highest to date among the HTL, and organic HTMs also allow high stability in PSCs to be achieved. An efficiency summary of the organic and inorganic HTMs is shown in Fig. 5. For instance, one of the most well-known and commercial small molecules, which is employed in the most efficient photovoltaic devices is spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene).92 The PCE of the devices using this material as an HTL is around 21.1%.93 Also, devices with FDT (2′,7′-bis(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)spiro[cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-4,9′-fluorene) approached the highest PCE of 20.2% and cells using FDT HTM showed little degradation after two months under dry conditions.59 Among the polymeric HTMs, the champion PCE of the device using PTAA as HTL was about 22.1%.60 Additionally, a novel polymeric HTM comprised of benzo[1,2-b:4,5:b]dithiophene (BDT) and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) (namely PTEG) exhibited good performances with an overall PCE of 19.8%.94 Interestingly, prior to the report on PTEG, the same research group revealed another polymeric HTM based on BDT and BT (hereafter called RCP), which provided superior long-term stability under stringent operating conditions (75% humidity) for over 1400 hours.95 In recent years, there has also been increasing interest in the use of organometallic HTMs. For example, the PSC using a zinc(II) phthalocyanine (ZnPc)-based organometallic HTM exhibited a power conversion efficiency up to 17.8%.96
 Fig. 5  Progress of the efficiency of PSCs using recently synthesized organic and inorganic HTMs. The power conversion efficiencies of the solar cells with HTMs were evaluated under 1 sun illumination (100 mW cm−2). The maximum efficiencies of the conventional and standard PTAA and spiro-OMeTAD HTM-based devices were found to be 22.1%60 and 21.1%,93 respectively. For small molecules (active area ranging from 0.126 to 0.16 cm2), the data are listed from: 9.7%,53 12.4%,97 14.8%,98 13.44%,79 20.1%,59 20.1%,99 and 22.3%.100 For polymers (active area ranging from 0.09 to 0.1134 cm2), the data are listed from: 5.55%,101 9.2%,102 14.1%,43 17.3%,68 19.8%,94 and 19.38%.103 For organometallic compounds (active area ranging from 0.08 to 0.16 cm2), the data are listed from: 5%,104 15.4%,90 11.75%,105 17.5%,106 and 17.8%.96 For inorganic materials (active area ranging from 0.0314 to 0.15 cm2), the data are listed from: 6%,107 15.4%,108 16.6%,109 19%,110 20.6%,111 and 18.85%.112 

2.2.1 Organometallic HTMs. 
In late 2014, copper(II) phthalocyanine (CuPc) was reported as the first organometallic compound as a HTL for PSCs.104 The CuPc-based devices exhibited an overall PCE of 5%. Subsequently, several new HTMs based on metal phthalocyanines were developed to improve the efficiency mainly due to their flexibility, simple and low-cost synthesis and purification, high thermal and chemical stability, and high carrier mobility.96,113 For example, doped ZnPc (tetra-5-hexylthiophene- and tetra-5-hexyl-2,2′-bisthiophene-substituted zinc phthalocyanines) HTM-based devices showed a high PCE of 17.5%.106 To date, the best PCE of phthalocyanine-based devices is 17.8%, which was achieved using dopant-free copper(II) phthalocyanine with tetrapropyl-substituted functional groups (CuPrPc) as the HTM.96 Even though the efficiency gap between organometallic HTMs and polymeric/small molecular HTMs has been reduced significantly (as shown in Fig. 5), the presence of transition metals in the structure is a critical issue because these elements can lead to toxicity and carcinogenicity, which potentially cause serious health problems.114,115 Furthermore, a recent study showed that the efficiency and stability of non-metal phthalocyanine HTM-based devices were better than that of metal phthalocyanine HTM-based devices.116


2.2.2 Conjugated polymers as HTMs. 
Semiconducting polymers are one type of HTM for perovskite solar cells. The most widely studied polymer HTMs are PTAA, P3HT (poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl)), and PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–poly(styrenesulfonate)). To use polymeric HTMs, some critical criteria need to be satisfied including proper energy levels, low cost, flexibility, high hole mobility and high solubility.91,117 In this section, the device performance and issues associated with the use of conventional polymeric HTMs, such as PTAA, P3HT, and PEDOT:PSS, for PSCs are discussed. Afterwards, various novel polymers that have potential to replace these traditional choices for high-performance and low-cost PSCs are listed.
Among the polymer compounds fabricated as HTLs for mesoporous TiO2-based PSCs, devices with doped PTAA as the HTM showed an extremely high PCE of 22.1% in small cells (0.16 cm2).60 Under similar conditions, the PCE was 19.7% in 1 cm2 cells. PTAA possesses a very high hole mobility (10−2–10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) and it exhibits strong chemical interaction with the perovskite layer.118 Recently, Junsheng and co-authors reported that although PTAA doped with common additives such as Li-TFSI and tBP gave a PCE of 17.77%, replacement of these dopants with a fluorine-containing hydrophobic Lewis acid dopant (LAD) in PTAA boosted the PCE to 19.01% with an exceptional fill factor of 0.81.119 Nevertheless, PTAA polymers are extremely expensive and their cost is about 50 times that of gold.118,120 Another extensively employed and well understood polymer in organic photovoltaic research is poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). It is stable and has a relatively high carrier mobility and the advantages of straightforward synthesis and low cost.121,122 When P3HT was used for the first time as the HTL with additives in a conventional PSC, the cell gave an overall PCE of 9.3%.123 After P3HT was blended with 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine (D-TBP), the P3HT-based devices showed an improved PCE of 12.4%.124 Later, the PCE of the PSCs with P3HT as the HTL increased from 3.6% for pristine P3HT to 8.3% for P3HT blended with bamboo-structured carbon nanotubes.125 Additionally, Snaith and co-workers enhanced the PCE to 15.4% by using a mixture of P3HT and spiro-OMeTAD with single-walled carbon nanotubes as the HTL in the device.126 Recently, the same group used a new mixed halide and mixed cation perovskite layer (FA0.83MA0.17Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3) together with a similar mixed HTL, and the efficiency was improved to 18.8%.127 For inverted perovskite architectures, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene:polystyrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) has been used extensively and successfully as an HTM. To date, p–i–n devices with PEDOT:PSS HTLs approached a PCE of 18.1%.128 Unfortunately, PEDOT:PSS is hydrophilic and its strong acidic nature compromises the long-term stability of devices.120 Overall, the traditional HTMs exhibit exceptional efficiency but they have other shortcomings, such as high cost and use additives with enhanced conductivity but worse stability (such as Li salts). These shortcomings are a major bottleneck in the development of PSCs. Thus, the synthesis of new polymeric HTMs with high efficiency, requiring no additives, and better stability for PSCs is extremely important.
A list of novel synthesized polymeric HTMs is summarized in Table 1 and their structures are illustrated in Fig. 6. Basically, there are two types of polymers, one involves only donor conjugated building blocks incorporated in the backbone and the other is a combination of donor–acceptor alternating conjugated building blocks called donor–acceptor (D–A) polymers. Among the various classes of materials, D–A conjugated polymers offer several benefits for OPV including their superior and tunable optical and electrical properties such as energy levels, low band gap, high mobility, and good film formation.68,129 These properties make D–A conjugated polymers good candidates for dopant-free polymeric HTMs for highly efficient and stable PSCs.

 Fig. 6  Chemical structures of polymeric HTMs. 
The first conjugated D–A polymer employed as an HTM was PCBTDPP (poly[N-90-heptadecanyl-2,7carbazole-alt-3,6-bis(thiophen-5-yl)-2,5-dioctyl-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4]pyrrole-1,4-dione]).101 Without dopants, the PCE of the PCBTDPP-based MAPbI3 devices was 5.55%. An outstanding Voc of 1.15 V together with a PCE of 3.04% was achieved in MAPbBr3 devices. Subsequently, by replacing (a) the carbazole unit with thienylvinylenethienyl and (b) the octyl alkyl chain with a decyldodecyl chain in the diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) moiety, Park and co-workers reported a new HTM, PDPPDBTE (poly[2,5-bis(2-decyldodecyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione-(E)-1,2-di(2,2′-bithiophen-5-yl)ethene]).102 Although the hole mobility of PDPPDBTE is inferior to that of PCBTDPP, the PCE of the PDPPDBTE-based MAPbI3 devices increased to 9.2% due to the presence of two traditional additives (Li-TFSI and tBP). Even though DPP units possess excellent properties and are widely applied in OPV, the PCE of PCS using their derivatives as HTMs is very low and they seem to require additives.
Another interesting acceptor for designing new conjugated D–A polymers for HTMs is the 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD) moiety. Indeed, various BTD derivatives have been synthesized and used successfully as HTMs in PSCs, for instance, TTB-TTQ (based on 2,3-bis(3-(octyloxy)phenyl)quinoxaline and BTD),43 PPDT2FBT (poly[(2,5-bis(2-hexyldecyloxy)-phenylene)-alt-(5,6-difluoro-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c]-[1,2,5]-thiadiazole)]),130 and PCDTBT1 (poly[9-(heptadecan-9-yl)-9H-carbazole-2,7-diyl-alt-(5,6-bis(methyloxy))-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-5,5-diyl]).131 Particularly, the combination of benzo[1,2-b:4,5:b′]dithiophene (BDT) and BTD has produced some exciting conjugated D–A polymers for dopant-free HTMs and highly stable PSCs, including RPC (based on benzo[1,2-b:4,5:b′]dithiophene (BDT) and BTD),68 asy-PBTBDT2-MA (4,8-bis((2-butyloctyl)oxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene and BTD),132 PTEG (based on BDT and BTD with the introduction of a tetraethylene glycol (TEG) chain in BTD),94 P2 (poly[4,8-bis(2-(4-(2-ethylhexyloxy)3-fluorophenyl)-5-thienyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophenealt-1,3-bis(4-octylthien-2-yl)-5-(2-ethylhexyl)thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione]),133 P3 (poly[4-(5-(4,8-bis(5-(6-((2-hexyldecyl)oxy)naphthalen-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophen-2-yl)-4-octylthiophen-2-yl)-5,6-difluoro-7-(4-octylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole]),134 and pBBTa–BDT2 (4,8-dithien-2-yl-benzo[1,2-d:4,5-d′]bistriazole-alt-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophenes).47 Besides them, a Cs-perovskite device using PTEG as the HTM exhibited a very high efficiency. In mesoporous TiO2-structrued devices, the highest PCE of 19.1% was achieved with Li-TFSI as an additive. By replacing TiO2 with SnO2, the PCE reached 19.8% without any additives, which is the champion efficiency to date.


2.2.3 Small molecules as HTMs. 
The most widely used small molecule hole transporting material is spiro-OMeTAD. Using this HTM, devices achieved a significant performance of 21.1% within a shortperiod,93 which is due to its ability to form a uniform and smooth surface on top of the perovskite layer91,135 and fabrication by either vacuum-deposition or solution-based processes.136 Nevertheless, there are still some major shortcomings of this material, which can have a negative impact on the development of PSCs, such as (a) it is extremely expensive, costing roughly 400 USD per gram;77,137,138 (b) its multistep synthesis, resulting in high production cost for commercial solar cells;78,135 and (c) the requirement of additives to increase the PCE of the device; however, at the cost of stability.75,139 These bottlenecks can be overcome by developing new generation HTMs via rational molecular design.
From the point of the view of chemical structure, a symmetrical structure is critical to enhance π–π stacking interactions, leading to high hole mobility.140–142 There are numerous small molecule HTMs employed successfully in various types of PSCs thus far. Therefore, in this section, we focus on symmetrical small molecule HTMs, which exhibit PCEs above 15%. A list of the novel small molecule HTMs is summarized in Table 2. Basically, they can be categorized into three main groups: (a) linear, (b) star-shaped, and (c) spiro-orthogonal structures, as shown in Fig. 7. The chemical structures of typical HTMs are illustrated in Fig. 8–10.

a. Linear structure small molecules. 
Many HTMs have been developed using a basic skeleton of linear molecules. They have the advantages of simple synthesis and purification, strong π-conjugation for strong intermolecular interaction, and convenient supply chain of chemicals widely used in organic electronics studies.117 Moreover, their slim molecular design can provide excellent pore filling capability.143 Currently, most of them require additives to improve the cell efficiency. However, there are some potential structures that can give a high PCE without any dopants. Basically, symmetrical linear HTMs can be classified into: (i) D–A–D, (ii) A–D–A and (iii) D–π–D types using donor (D), acceptor (A) and π-linker units.
For D–A–D-type conjugated molecules, although there are few HTMs of this type reported to date, their PCE has achieved promising values. With the presence of additives, although the efficiency of mesoporous MAPbI3 devices with TQ2(4,4′-(2,3-bis(5-methylthiophen-2-yl)quinoxaline-5,8-diyl)bis(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline)) as the HTM peaked at 19.62%,144 the efficiency of mesoporous mixed (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 devices with YN2 (4,4′-(2,3-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine-5,7-diyl)bis(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline)) as the HTM approached 19.27%.145 The PCE of other D–A–D HTM-based PCSs in conventional mesoporous layouts were lower than 12%.77,146,147 Besides them, although devices with a simple dopant-free DPA–ANT–DPA (4,10-bis(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)naphtho[7,8,1,2,3-nopqr]tetraphene-6,12-dione) HTM displayed a PCE of 11.5%, their efficiency was still low, which is ascribed to the excessively small band offset of the LUMO between the perovskite and HTL.77 In contrast, the PCE of planar devices using doped JY5 (9,9′-(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-4,7-diyl)bis(4,1-phenylene))bis(N3,N3,N6,N6-tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)-9H-carbazole-3,6-diamine), JY6 (9,9′-(5-fluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-4,7-diyl)bis(4,1-phenylene))bis(N3,N3,N6,N6-tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)-9H-carbazole-3,6-diamine) and Yih-2 (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(4-(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)-10′H-spiro[fluorene-9,9′-phenanthren]-10′-one) as HTLs reached 16.87%,148 18.54%,149 and 16.06%,150 respectively.
Although A–D–A-type conjugated molecules have been intensively developed as donor materials in OSCs, studies on HTMs for PSCs are very rare. Recently, Sun and colleagues reported a series of A–D–A dopant-free HTMs.151 Among them, the device with M7-TFSI (4,4′-(5,5′-(7,7′-(5,5′-(4,8-bis((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(3-hexylthiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-7,4-diyl))bis(4-hexyl-thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(1-(2-ethylhexyl)pyridin-1-ium)bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide) as the HTM exhibited a PCE of 17.7%. In addition, the PCEs of the PSCs based on doped spiro-OMeTAD decayed to 63%, while M7-TFSI-based devices retained 64% of their initial efficiency during the same aging period.
On the other hand, several D–π–D HTMs exhibiting very high PCE have been reported. In the mesoporous devices FTO/TiO2/(mp)TiO2/perovskite/HTL/Au, a PCE of above 20.1% was achieved with novel synthesized HTMs. For MAPbI3 perovskite, the device with Z26 (4,4′-((1E,1′E)-(3,4-dimethoxythiophene-2,5-diyl)bis(ethene-2,1-diyl))bis(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline)) with additives as the HTM displayed a PCE of 20.1%.99 Importantly, the devices based on Z26 showed better stability compared to the reference device based on spiro-OMeTAD. Moreover, the estimated cost of its synthesis was only $35.57 per gram, which is cheaper than that of spiro-OMeTAD. For (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 perovskite, the champion PCE of 20.8% together with an impressive Voc of 1.15 V was achieved with doped X55 (N2,N7-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-N2,N7-di(spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthen]-2-yl)spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene]-2,7-diamine) as the HTM. Furthermore, the facile synthesis of X55 via a one-pot approach makes this HTM very promising for large-scale production in at low cost.135 Even though the device performance with these HTMs exhibited very high PCE and their synthesis seems to be cost-effective, their performance depends critically on additives, which make the device very unstable for long-term application.75,77,139 To overcome this critical issue, a series of low-cost dopant-free HTMs based on the D–π–D geometry have been developed. Besides them, Sonar and co-workers explored the anthanthrone (ANT) dye as a new potential moiety for inexpensive, more stable, and highly efficient HTMs for the fabrication of cost-effective and printable PSCs.137 In their work, the device configuration (FTO/TiO2/(mp)TiO2/MAPbI3/HTL/Au) employing pristine TPA–ANT–TPA (4,4′-(6,12-bis(octyloxy)-6,12-dihydronaphtho[7,8,1,2,3-nopqr]tetraphene-4,10-diyl)bis(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline)) as the HTL resulted in a PCE of 17.5% with an impressive FF of 0.79.137 Besides their outstanding efficiency, better stability was observed for the devices using undoped TPA–ANT–TPA HTL compared to that with doped spiro-OMeTAD. Notably, the lab-scale synthesis cost of TPA–ANT–TPA is estimated to be roughly two-thirds that of commercial spiro-OMeTAD, which can further decrease if large-scale synthesis is performed. The other promising dopant-free HTM that can give comparable efficiency is XPP (N2,N2,N7,N7-tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)-3′,6′-bis(pyridin-4-ylmethoxy)spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene]-2,7-diamine). XPP showed a PCE of 17.2% with a high FF of 0.789 in planar (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15-based PSCs.152
b. Star-shaped (3D) small molecules. 
Among the high performance HTMs based on a 3D design structure, the planar configuration using doped TET (2,6,14-tris(5′-(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aminophenol-4-yl)-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophen-2-yl)-triptycene) as the HTM exhibited a PCE of 19.1%.153 The report also stated that the cost of TET on a unit area of one device is significantly lower (25 times) than that of high-purity spiro-OMeTAD due to its lower laboratory synthesis and purification cost ($123 vs. $500 g−1) and thinner HTL (30 vs. 200 nm). For the mesoporous ((FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15)-based devices, the highest PCE of the device with BTT-4 (4,4′,4′′-(benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b′:6,5-b′′]trithiophene-2,5,8-triyl)tris(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline)) as the HTL was about 19.0%.154 However, the presence of additives can increase the production cost and affect the device stability. Another outstanding design based on a star-shaped structure from Rakstys and colleagues showed a PCE of 19% without any dopants or thermal treatment in the mesoporous (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 PSCs.155 To the best of our knowledge, this is currently the highest efficiency for dopant-free HTMs of PSCs. The material called KR321 (2,2′,2′′-(((5,10,15-trihexyl-10,15-dihydro-5H-diindolo[3,2-a:3′,2′-c]carbazole-3,8,13-triyl)tris(3,3′′-dihexyl-[2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene]-5′′,5-diyl))tris(methanylylidene))trimalononitrile) was designed based on the donor–π-bridge–acceptor (D–π–A) type. According to grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), KR321 forms a particular face-on organization on perovskite films, favoring charge carrier transport in the direction normal to layer planes. This study revealed that the molecular engineering of a planar donor core, π-spacer and periphery acceptor possibly results in high vertical carrier mobility, and this kind of design can provide useful insight into the synthesis of next-generation HTMs for perovskite solar cells and optoelectronic applications.155
c. Spiro-orthogonal (4D) small molecules. 
Compared to the linear and star-shaped designs, almost all HTMs based on the spiro-orthogonal structure require additives to enhance the device performance. For doped HTMs with inverted layouts, the best PCE was found to be roughly 19% for Si-OMeTPA (4′,4′′′,4′′′′′,4′′′′′′′-silanetetrayltetrakis(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-[1,10-biphenyl]-4-amine)) HTL.156 Particularly, instead of using traditional additives like Li-TFSI, Li and co-workers applied F4-TCNQ157 as a dopant for these inverted devices. In addition to using an additive, the authors attempted to thermally anneal the HTLs at 150 °C for 30 min before depositing perovskite films. The resultant device performance with both treatment methods reached 14.15% compared to the PCE of 6.85% without any treatment. Furthermore, by replacing the components of the electron transporting layer (PCBM) with a mixture of PCBM/C60/BCP, the devices showed a further improved PCE of 19.06%, with a Jsc of 23.08 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.07 V and FF of 77.17%.156 On the other hand, the doped dispiro-OBuTAD (2,2′′,7,7′′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-butoxyphenyl)amino]dispiro[fluorene-9,6′-indeno[1,2-b]fluorene-12′,9′′-fluorene]) HTL exhibited a PCE of 18.46% in (mp)-TiO2/MAPbI3/HTL layouts.158 Apart from doped spiro-orthogonal HTMs, 2,7 BCz-OMeTAD ((2,2′,7,7′)-tetrakis(N,N′-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-N,N′-bicarbazole) and TPD-4MeOTPA (N,N-di(phenyl)-N′,N′-di(4-(4-N,N-di(4-(4-methoxy-phenyl)amino)-phenyl)ethenyl)-1,1′-biphenyl-4,4′-diamine) were developed and employed as dopant-free HTMs in mesoporous TiO2-based MAPbI3 devices.159,160 Interestingly, 2,7 BCz-OMeTAD, which consists of N,N′-bicarbazole as the core moiety and four diphenylamine groups as end-cappers, was successfully fabricated as a perfect ultrathin (∼30 nm) HTL in large-area PSCs up to 1 cm2, delivering a PCE of 17.5%.159 Moreover, the lab synthesis and purification cost of this compound was only $14 per gram, which is the cheapest cost to date. Recently, a group of Korean scientists successfully engineered a spiro core with 4 fluorene moieties as end-capping groups, coded as DM(N2,N2′,N7,N7′-tetrakis(9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)-N2,N2′,N7,N7′-tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)-9,9′-spirobi[fluorene]-2,2′,7,7′-tetraamine), to make a new type material as the HTL of mesoporous mixed (FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3) perovskite solar cells devices. Incredibly, these authors reported certified efficiencies of 22.6% (small-area cells, ∼0.094 cm2) and 20.9% (large-area, ∼1 cm2). In addition, the encapsulated devices exhibited better thermal stability than that with the standard spiro-OMeTAD, and retained 95% of its initial efficiency in a 500 h period at 60 °C.100

2.3 Electron transporting materials
As mentioned above, together with the HTL, the electron-transporting layer (ETL), where electrons are injected from the active layer and then moved through the ETL to the electrode, is also vital for highly efficient PSCs.212,213 Although there are numerous reports related to the HTLs of PSC, the efforts devoted to the ETL are relatively fewer. Particularly, this is associated with the fact that good inorganic (TiO2) and organic (fullerenes) ETL are available, providing both high efficiency and good stability, and the ETL is less of a bottleneck than the HTL. However, with the progress on the HTL and exploration of a variety of perovskite materials (mixed halide, mixed cation, lead free, etc.), there is increasing need to design high performing ETLs, which will maximize the performance with a particular perovskite/HTM combination.
Theoretically, the LUMO/CBM and HOMO/VBM of the ETL should be lower than that of the perovskite layer to assist electron transport and block hole movement, respectively.212,214,215 Indeed, studies have indicated that the lower the LUMO, the higher the electron-collecting ability.212,215 However, a lower LUMO leads to a lower Voc and research has demonstrated cases where even though the LUMO/CBM of the ETL is deeper than that of the perovskite layer or other ETLs, the PCE of the devices is not enhanced.216 For instance, despite having a low-lying LUMO value, the PCE of devices based on the HATNASO2C7-Cs ETL was worse than that with HATNASOC7-Cs, which possesses a higher LUMO.217 In some cases, novel ETMs with similar LUMO values showed very different PCEs under the same characterization conditions.218,219 Thus, the LUMO needs to be optimized in concert with other criteria, including sufficient hole-blocking properties, high electron mobility, simple synthesis, easy dissolution in common organic solvents, high thermal and good air stability.214,220 The improvement of PSCs via novel ETMs can also be achieved by preventing the generation of iodide or amines under operating conditions at the interface of the ETL and the perovskite. Moreover, the ETL should completely cover the perovskite layer to prevent moisture and air ingress, which degrades the stability of the devices.214
Generally, ETLs can be made from both inorganic and organic compounds. An efficiency summary of organic and inorganic ETMs is given in Fig. 11. Compared to organic materials, inorganic materials, which are mainly metal oxides such as TiO2, ZnO and SnO2, have been more extensively applied in PSCs to date.212,221 In this regard, TiO2 has been employed successfully as ETM (electron transport material) in PSCs with a high PCE of 22.1%.60 Unfortunately, one major disadvantage of the TiO2-based ETLs is their high processing temperatures, which translates into higher costs, while also impeding the development of flexible PSCs.222 Although TiO2 can also be fabricated at relatively low temperatures, this process leads to inferior electron transport, leading to worse device performances than that based on high-temperature-treated TiO2 ETL.223 Another choice is zinc oxide (ZnO). Although ZnO-based PSCs displayed a PCE of 15.7%,224 zinc oxides are extremely unstable under weak acid or alkali conditions, resulting in a decrease in the stability of the device.222 Although decent device performance has been achieved, high annealing temperatures in the fabrication process cannot be avoided, leading to a limitation in large-scale production and flexible applications.225 Thus, the exploration of novel organic ETMs that can be utilized under low temperature processes is necessary. The use of organic materials at the TiO2 or SnO2 interface as a passivation layer is not discussed in this part.
 Fig. 11  Progress of efficiency of PSCs using newly synthesized organic and inorganic ETMs. The power conversion efficiencies of the solar cells with ETMs were evaluated under 1 sun illumination (100 mW cm−2). The maximum efficiencies of conventional and standard PCBM and TiO2 ETM-based devices were 20.01%226 and 22.1%.60 For organic ETMs (active area ranging from 0.0725 to 0.16 cm2), the data are taken from: 8.15%,227 17.62%,217 19.6%,228 and 20.2%.226 For inorganic ETMs (active area ranging from 0.09 to 0.16 cm2), the data are taken from: 5%,229 19.3%,230 14.1%,231 20.8%,232 19.17%,233 and 19.56%.234 
Organic ETMs may be categorized into: (i) fullerene derivatives, (ii) non-fullerene derivatives and (iii) neutral polymers. Each part is briefly discussed in the following sections. Moreover, a summary of the synthesized non-fullerene ETLs is listed in Tables 3 and 4, while their chemical structures are displayed in Fig. 12.

 Fig. 12  Chemical structure of the synthesized ETMs. 

2.3.1 Fullerene derivatives. 
Fullerene derivatives, mostly PC61BM and PC71BM, are the most popular organic ETL materials, which give rise to the so-called OPV-type PSC. In the first report, fullerene (C60) and its derivatives, such as ICBA (indene-C60 bisadduct) and PCBM, were successfully employed as ETMs in the inverted device structure: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3/ETM/BCP/Al. The device performance with PCBM showed a then-high PCE of 3.9%.235 For regular planar MAPbI3 architectures, the device with C60 as the ETM exhibited a PCE of 14.5%, which was better than that with TiO2 (13.9%) under similar conditions.236 Other studies also demonstrated that room-temperature vacuum-deposited C60 thin films (∼7.5 nm) were excellent electron selective layers for planar perovskite solar cells with the regular structure. The resultant device exhibited a higher PCE of 15.14% along with less hysteresis than the cell without C60.237 On the other hand, Uddin and colleagues reported that the PCE of the device using PC61BM and PC71BM as ETMs reached 12.7% and 13.9% respectively.238 To boost the device performance, decamethylcobaltocene (DMC) was applied as a new n-type additive for fullerenes. Although the device using bis(1-[3-(methoxycarbonyl)propyl]-1-phenyl)-[6,6]C62 (bis-PCBM) as the ETM showed a PCE of 17.76%, the presence of DMC enhanced the PCE to 20.14%.239 The use of fullerene-based materials in PSC has been previously reviewed;240,241 thus, we only highlight salient points of interest here. A major difference between the use of fullerenes in OPV and in PSC is that due to the good carrier transport properties of perovskite materials, high efficiencies can be obtained with planar configurations. Therefore, one of the major reasons for functionalizing fullerene in BHJ cells disappears, namely, control of the bulk heterojunction morphology. In planar perovskites, bare C60 and C70 or their mixtures319 work very well,241,242 but the functionalization of C60 and C70 is still useful in planar PSCs to control the crystallinity and thereby charge the transport properties, as well as band alignment and charge separation at the interface with the perovskite layer. In this way, for example, fullerene derivatives optimized for different perovskites (lead-free, mixed halide, etc.) can be designed.241 The type and number of the addends as well as the buckyball size (C60 or C70) can be used to tune the band alignment by up to half an eV and thereby balance the need to minimize voltage losses and to maximize charge separation.243 When charge transport proceeds by hopping between LUMOs, as is often the case in fullerenes,244 addends do not affect localization of the frontier orbitals predominantly on the buckyball, but strongly affect electron transport rate via packing (overlap integral). For example, calculations predicted that indene and quimodimethane addends can enhance charge transport rates, while the aryl addend is predicted to lead to much smaller mobilities of electrons (and holes) vs. PC61BM and that the addition of the –CH2 and bisaddend can significantly enhance the charge transfer rates for the PCBM addend.243 C60 and C70 have similar LUMO, and the choice of C70 can be made to enhance solar absorption (which is not dominated by the HOMO-to-LUMO transition) and harvest additional photocurrent. Moreover, fullerenes are believed to fill pinholes in the perovskite layer and passivate defects.245
Currently, fullerene ETL-based planar PSC have reached efficiencies approaching 20% and thus are competitive with sensitized-type cells using inorganic ETMs.128,242
In addition to the ETL, fullerene derivatives have also been used for interface modification of the ETL (for instance, coating TiO2 with self-assembled monolayer of fullerene derivatives),246,247 and passivation of the perovskite layer by the addition of fullerene in perovskite solution,248 in chlorobenzene as antisolvents249 or insertion of the as-prepared film into a fullerene solution.250 However, these will not be discussed in detail in this review since the focus is on the interfacial layers.


2.3.2 Non-fullerene oligomers. 
Despite their advantages of high electron mobility, three-dimensional transport and efficient passivation of the traps on the perovskite surface, fullerenes and their derivatives suffer from disadvantages such high cost and poor ambient stability.251,252 In addition to these shortcomings, their energy levels cannot be easily adjusted because structurally they cannot easily undergo chemical modifications.225 Therefore, developing new non-fullerene n-type semiconductors ETL for PSCs is quite important to deal with the above-mentioned deficiencies.
Among the non-fullerene ETMs developed for PSSs, naphthalene diimide (NDI) and perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives have been widely used due to their easy synthesis, energy level tunability and strong electron accepting ability.
In the case of naphthalene diimide (NDI) moieties, Im's research group recently chose naphthalene diimides (NDIs) as the organic n-type semiconductors for n-type ETL owing to their easy synthesis, high electron mobility, and good solution processability.228 In addition, the physical properties and molecular ordering in the crystalline state of NDI-based materials are readily tuned by N-substituted side-chains. The compound NDI-PM (N,N′-bis(phenylmethyl) naphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic diimide) was utilized as an ETL for inverted structured PSCs, displaying a PCE of 19.6%, which is comparable to the efficiency of PCBM ETM-based PSCs. Furthermore, owing to the much stronger hydrogen bonds in the NDI-PM molecular crystals, the NDI-based PSCs showed enhanced thermal stability. By modifying the N-side chain from phenylmethyl to 1-indanylnaphthalene to obtain a novel compound N,N′-bis(1-indanyl)naphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic diimide (NDI-ID), the PCE of the PSC based on the new ETL approached 20.2%.226 Additionally, the device showed very high long-term temperature stability, retaining 90% of its initial PCE after 500 h at 100 °C under 1 sun illumination without encapsulation.
For perylene diimide (PDI) groups, perylene-3,4:9,10-tetracarboxylic acid diimides (PDIs) have attracted great attention over the past decade for designing n-type organic semiconductors for application in OSCs and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) due to their outstanding properties, such as low-cost, high photostability, tunable energy levels, and high electron mobility over 1 cm2 V−1 s−1. The use of PDIs as ETLs in PSCs was reported recently by Jo et al. for a device incorporating the dimer diPDI doped with 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzoimidazole (DMBI), showing a PCE of 10%.253 In 2017, Chu and co-workers employed N,N′-dipentyl-3,4,9,10-perylenedicarboximide (PDI) in planar heterojunction PSCs.254 To enhance the charge transport and exciton dissociation and to better align the energy levels of the organometal halide and PDI, methyl ammonium bromide (MABr) was added as a dopant. The PSCs incorporating PDI as the ETL exhibited improved morphologies with lower surface roughness, leading to a relatively high efficiency of 11.04%. In the same year, Chen et al. reported a series of mono-halogen-substituted PDI.255 Among them, although the Br-PDI based ETLs showed quite a good PCE of 10.5%, the other derivatives H-PDI and F-PDI exhibited low or no electron transporting ability. Recently, Meng's research group used a PDI derivative (PDIN) with amino terminal as the ETL in p–i–n PSCs by dissolving PDIN in trifluoroethanol.251 PDIN lowered the work function of the cathode and exhibited excellent electron transport capacity, which resulted in the high efficiency of 15.28%. Additionally, other PDIs derivatives include benzoic[ghi]perylenetriimide (BPTI) moieties, which were studied for ETL materials in a series of PSCs by Chu and collaborators.256 In their report, the BPTI monomer and twisted dimer t-BPTI were expanded on the π-conjugated plane by a five-membered imide ring along the short axis on the original PDI backbone. The devices with the t-BPTI/C60 double ETL yielded a maximum efficiency of 11.63%.
Apart from the NDI and PDI units, there are other small molecules designed for ETM that show good performance. In 2016, Zhang's research group reported a novel n-type organic small molecule based on an azaacene derivative, namely QCAPZ (1,4,9,16-tetrakis((triisopropylsilyl)ethynyl)quinoxalino[2′′′,3′′′:4′′,5′′]cyclopenta[1′′,2′′,3′′:5′,6′]acenaphtho[1′,2′:5,6]pyrazino[2,3-b]phenazine) as an ETL material for inverted PSCs without the need of dopants or additives.257 The MAPbI3-based inverted PSC with the new material showed a PCE up to 10.26%. In the same year, Jen and co-workers reported a series of hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATNA) derivatives.217 To ensure that the LUMO was compatible with the conduction band minimum of MAPbI3, different oxidation states for the sulfur atoms in the alkylsulfanyl chains (sulfide, sulfoxide, and sulfone) were prepared. As a result, the PCS fabricated with the p–i–n architecture using HATNASOC7-Cs exhibited an encouraging PCE of 17.6%. In 2017, Fang and colleagues developed a benzobis(thiadiazole)-based small molecule called B2F with two fluorene end-capping units.258 Due to the well-matched energy level of B2F, a high PCE of 17.18% was obtained with a Voc of 1.05 V, Jsc of 20.63 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.79. More recently, Yang and co-authors employed two π-conjugated small molecules based on the multifused rigid ladder-type backbone of ITCPTC ((3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-cyclopentane-1,3-dione-[c]-thiophen))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene)), which differed by the side chain thiophene and selenophene groups as ETMs in inverted PSCs.225 ITCPTC-Th with the thiophene side chain demonstrated a smoother film morphology, higher electron mobility, and better electron extraction and electron transporting properties, which led to a high efficiency of 17.11%. To further improve the device performance, an additional C60 electron transporting layer was employed and a PCE of 19% was achieved in the devices containing ITCPTC interlayers.225


2.3.3 Neutral polymers. 
N-Type polymers have recently been proposed as promising candidates for ETMs in PSC due to their outstanding features such as high energy levels, suitable band gaps, and chemical stability, and the advantage that the molecular packing can be adjusted by modifying the chemical structure of the polymer. Furthermore, the film-forming ability of polymers is normally better than that of small molecules due to polymeric chain entanglement. However, to date, few studies have reported the use of n-type polymers as an ETM in PSC and most of them are based on naphthalene diimide (NDI) or perylene diimide (PDI) moieties.
Recently, Wang et al. employed a series of D–A type polymers based on naphthalene diimide (NDI) as an electron accepting unit and bithiophene or thiophenylvinylthiophene or thienothiophene as an electron donating group, namely N2200 (poly[N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalene diimide-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)), PNVT-8 (poly[N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalene diimide-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-di(thiophen-2-yl)-2,2′-(E)-2-(2-(thiophen-2-yl)vinyl)thiophene]), and PNDI2OD-TT (poly[N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalene diimide-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-(thieno[3,2-b]thiophene)]) as the ETM for inverted planar heterojunction PSCs. Among them, the device based on N2200 showed the best performance with a Jsc of 14.70 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.84 V, and FF of 0.66, corresponding to a PCE of ∼8.15%. This result is ascribed to the high electron mobility, strong light absorption and well-matched HOMO/LUMO levels of N2200 to the perovskite.227
The polymer N2200 or PNDI-2T was also investigated by Guo's group.215 In their study, they demonstrated that using N-DMBI ((4-(1,3-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)phenyl)dimethylamine) as a dopant for the polymer not only increased the conductivity of the polymeric ETM (PNDI-2T) but also lowered its HOMO/LUMO levels, which led to enhanced electron extraction and hole blocking ability of the doped ETL. Consequently, the PCE reached 13.92%. Another promising polymer for ETM is a polymer based on NDI and a fluorene derivative called PFN-2TNDI, which was introduced by Sun et al.259 It was found that the amine functional groups on the side chains of the fluorine unit could modify the cathode work function and reduce surface recombination and interfacial resistance, leading to a high PCE of 16.7%.
More recently, Kim and co-workers designed a new copolymer P(NDI2DT–TTCN) that contains NDI and dicyano-terthiophene as ETM for PSC.214 The newly developed copolymer not only passivated the surface against ambient conditions but also enhanced the electron transport ability, thus offering a high PCE of 17.0% with negligible hysteresis in the field of polymeric ETLs.
For ETMs based on PDI polymers, Gou et al.260 recently reported a series of PDI-based polymers (PX-PDIs), which contain different donor units (X), including vinylene (V), thiophene (T), selenophene (Se), dibenzosilole (DBS) and cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT). The polymer PV-PDI as the ETL illustrated the best performance with a PCE of 10.14% due to its deeper LUMO level, highly delocalized LUMO electron density, and more planar structure.


2.3.4 Other potential ETMs. 
Recently, a few research groups have attempted to utilize ionic liquids (ILs) as an alternative to TiO2 for ETL of planar configuration PSCs because ILs can suppress hysteresis, are compatible with low-temperature solution processability and improve the quality of the perovskite film.223,261–264 For IL as an ETL, BenMeIM-Cl (1-benzyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride) was reported with the PCE of 15.04% and 16.09% for planar MAPbI3 and (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)-based devices respectively.262 For comparison with the standard TiO2, [EMIM]PF6 (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate) was applied as an ETM in MAPbI3 solar cells by Yang and co-workers. As a result, the device using [EMIM]PF6 as an ETL exhibited the best PCE of 14.39%, which is comparable to that of the reference TiO2-based device (14.96%).223

3 Perovskite photodetectors
Photodetectors are optoelectronic devices that can convert light into electrical signals via the photoelectric effect. Photodetectors have many applications in the area of optical communication, environmental monitoring, spectroscopy, and biological sensing. Thus far, the dominant strategy for the fabrication of photodetectors is based on inorganic materials, such as Si,265,266 carbon nanotubes,267,268 and group α-ε and β-δ compounds.269–272 Even though the fabrication processes and technologies for inorganic photodetectors are mature and reliable, their high manufacturing costs and complex fabrication processes limit their commercial applications.273,274 Solution-processed materials, such as organic materials and nanomaterials have attracted much attention in the area of photodetectors, but their poor charge carrier mobilities limit their detection performance.275,276 Photodetectors based on perovskite materials are emerging as a new photodetector technology. Perovskites-based photodetectors are promising and have potential for high performance and low-cost photodetectors. Solution-processed perovskites are direct-bandgap semiconductors and have large absorption coefficients. Thus, a very thin perovskite film (a few hundred nanometers) can achieve complete light absorption, thus resulting in a small travel distance for photogenerated charge carriers and fast photoresponse.
3.1 Working principles
Perovskite photodetectors can be divided into three types, including photoconductor, photodiode, and phototransistor. They have different device structures and operation principles. Photodiodes are an important type of photodetector, which consist of an n–i–p, p–i–n, or Schottky junction. The built-in electrical field produced within the junction of the photodiode will force electrons and holes to transport in opposite directions and to be collected by electrodes. The advantages of photodiodes include low dark current, fast response speed, and high detectivity. Besides, very low driving voltages are required to operate a photodiode due to the built-in fields at its interface. Compared with photodiodes, photoconductors have a much simpler device structure. A photoconductor typically consists of a semiconductor with two Ohmic metal contacts. The gain and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of a photoconductor are usually high because photoexcited electrons and holes can circulate through the external circuit more than one time before recombination. However, the response speed of a photoconductor is slow. Moreover, the Ohmic contact and large applied voltage of a photoconductor can lead to a large dark current, limiting the detectivity. A phototransistor has a gate electrode isolated by a thin dielectric film. After applying a gate voltage, the charge transport within the semiconducting channel will be modulated, thus leading to increased carrier lifetime and larger photoresponse. In addition, a phototransistor can also achieve ultrafast photoresponse speed.
Among the photodetectors, photoconductors and phototransistors possess the so-called lateral structure, in which the charge carriers within these devices transport in a lateral direction. Vertical-structure photodetectors are photodiodes, which require proper interfacial layers to decrease the dark current and improve detectivity. In the following, we will only focus on the applications of interfacial layers in perovskite-based photodiodes.
3.2 Inverted structure
Similar to perovskite solar cells, the structures of photodiodes can also be divided into two types: inverted and regular. The first perovskite-based photodiode with an inverted device structure adopted from perovskite solar cells (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3−xClx/PCBM/Al) was reported by Yang et al. in 2014.277 In this structure, PEDOT:PSS and PCBM served as the hole transporting and electron transporting layers, respectively. To reduce the charge recombination and dark current under reverse bias, they applied two different buffer layers, 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP) and poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) between the top electrode and PCBM, as shown in Fig. 13a and b, respectively. They reported that the use of buffer layers (BCP and PFN) greatly reduced the dark current and improved the detectivity of the perovskite photodetectors. Besides, the perovskite photodetector with a PFN buffer layer could work at a 0 V bias, giving rise to detectivity as high as 4 × 1014 Jones. These results demonstrate the importance selecting proper interfacial layers when designing high performance perovskite photodetectors. Subsequently, different research groups reported the introduction of trap passivation layers, such as PCBM/C60, to reduce the surface defects of solution-processed perovskite films and improve device performance. Fang et al. reported an inverted structure perovskite photodetector based on an N4,N4′-bis(4-(6-((3-ethyloxetan-3-yl)methoxy)hexyl)phenyl)-N4,N4-diphenylbiphenyl-4,4′-diamine (OTPD) HTL and PCBM/C60 ETL.278 By replacing PEDOT:PSS with OTPD, the electron injection barrier between the HTL to perovskite increased from 1.1 eV to 2.5 eV, as shown in Fig. 13c and d. On the other hand, a large hole injection barrier between Al and C60 enables lower hole injection under reverse bias. Moreover, C60 effectively fills the pinholes in perovskite films and eliminates leakage pathways. Through interface engineering, a highly sensitive perovskite photodetector with a low noise of 16 fA Hz−1/2 at −0.1 V, high average EQE approaching 90%, large linear dynamic range (LDR) of 94 dB and short response time of 120 ns has been achieved. Shen et al. also reported that by replacing PCBM with C60, the surface of the perovskite film can be effectively passivated and the dark current of perovskite-based photodetectors can be greatly reduced.279 To improve the quality of the perovskite film, they used PTAA instead of PEDOT:PSS. The nonwetting PTAA is important for growing large-size crystals within the perovskite film. Consequently, a solution-processed perovskite-based photodetector with an ultrafast response time of around 1 ns with operation at zero bias was achieved.

3.3 Regular structure
The regular structure perovskite-based photodetector (FTO/TiO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au) has also attracted much attention. In the regular structure, TiO2 and spiro-OMeTAD work as the ETL and HTL, respectively. Surface trap states on the TiO2 ETL, which may serve as recombination centers, are often considered to have a negative influence on the performance of perovskite-based optoelectronic devices.280,281 Sargent et al. reported a low-noise and high detectivity (1012 Jones) perovskite-based photodetector by modifying the TiO2 surface using Al2O3 and PCBM layers, as shown in Fig. 14a and b.282 The reduced dark current and improved detectivity of the perovskite photodetector are attributed to TiO2 surface trap passivation and hole blocking of Al2O3 and PCBM. Liu et al. also reported an improvement in the performance of perovskite photodetectors by introducing PC61BM to modify the surface of TiO2, films as shown in Fig. 14c and d.283 The introduced PC61BM simultaneously improved the photocurrent by facilitating the charge carrier transport at the perovskite and PC61BM interfaces and suppressing the dark current densities by passivating the inhomogeneous TiO2 film. As a result, the PC61BM modified perovskite photodetector achieved over 80% EQE at wavelengths ranging in the visible to near infrared region, which was attributed to the enhanced photoresponsivity and detectivity.283 R. Dong et al. demonstrated high gain and low-driving-voltage photodetectors with the structure of ITO/perovskite/TPD-Si2/MoO2/Ag, in which crosslink TPD-Si2 served as the HTL and electron blocking layer and encapsulating active layer to improve device stability.284 Benefitting from the trapped-hole-induced electron injection, the perovskite photodetector exhibited dual-functions of a photodiode in the dark and large photoconductive gain under illumination. A maximum device gain of 489 ± 6 was obtained at a very low driving voltage of −1 V. H. W. Chen et al. reported a device that can operate as both a high-sensitivity perovskite photodetector and a photovoltaic device, in which the perovskite layer was sandwiched between a TiO2 ETL and spiro-OMeTAD HTL.285 The low-cost solution-processed perovskite photodetector enabled light detection in a large dynamic range of incident power (10−7–10−1 W cm−2) by switching to a small voltage (−0.9 to +0.5 V). Besides, a high EQE and gain value of 2400 were achieved under weak monochromatic light, while sustaining a high photovoltaic performance. M. Xue et al. reported a ZnO nanorods/perovskite solar cell structure and achieved a self-powered photodetector with UV-vis tunable photoresponse characteristics.286 The dual-functional device possessed a PCE of 9.56% and good photoelectric properties at 0 V with the highest responsivity of 7.8 A W−1 without annealing and a detectivity of 1014 cm Hz1/2 W−1 for the device with ZnO nanorods annealed under vacuum.

4 Perovskite LEDs
In 1994, a perovskite material was reported to be used for the first time for light-emitting diode applications and highly intense electroluminescent (EL) of more than 10000 cd m−2 at 2 A cm−2 was obtained at a liquid-nitrogen temperature.287 The first room-temperature solution processed perovskite light-emitting diode (PeLED) based on CH3NH3PbX3 was reported in 2014.281 The solution processability of PeLED at low temperature makes it an attractive and promising candidate to replace the currently used solid-state light-emitting devices, which are processed in expensive and vacuum-based processing conditions.
Thus far, the external photoluminescence quantum efficiencies (PLQEs) in the range of 20–50% and up to 90% have been achieved in planar films and nanocrystals, respectively.288–290 The emission spectra of perovskites are narrow and their colour purity is comparable to that of CdSe based quantum dots. Besides, the bandgap of perovskites can be easily tuned by varying the halide composition or the size of perovskite nanocrystals, thus delivering colours across the full visible spectrum. For example, bright-green (517 nm) and red (630 nm) EL emissions were obtained in the first demonstration of PeLED by tuning the halide composition of the perovskite.281 With the above advantages, PeLEDs have become a promising candidate to replace organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs).
The interfacial materials, device structure and concepts developed in the area of OLEDs and QLEDs are combined with perovskite active layers for the performance improvement of PeLEDs. High performance PeLEDs require minimized non-radiative recombination, reduced leakage currents, balanced electron and hole injection, minimum injection barriers and good operational stability of both spectral purity and intensity.
4.1 Working principles
The operation of PeLEDs consists of electrical charge injection, transport, and radiative recombination. There are various components in a PeLED device, including a front transparent electrode (e.g., FTO and ITO), ETL, emitter, HTL, and back electrode. The carriers are injected through the electrode and are transported through an ETL or HTL to the emitter. After confinement and radiative recombination, light will be emitted from the emitter. In this process, losses may happen, leading to decreased photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), EQE, current efficiency (CE) and brightness. To reduce the optical and electrical losses in PeLED, various methods have been developed, such as 3D perovskite emitter layer engineering291 and synthesis of lower-dimensional layer perovskites. Besides the development of emitter materials, the design and selection of interfacial layers are also important for improving the performance of PeLEDs. Proper interfacial layers can facilitate the carrier injection into the emitter by band alignment. The selection of interfacial layers is also governed by the materials’ chemical compatibility in solution-processed devices. The roles of interfacial layers include reducing electron- and hole-injection barriers,292 improving the quality of the perovskite film,293 passivation of defects at grain boundaries and interfaces, blocking ion migration, and preventing moisture permeation into perovskite films.
4.2 Degradation at the perovskite/interlayer interface
The instability of perovskite seriously hinders the industrialization and commercialization of PeLEDs. The instability of PeLEDs can be categorized into two types, instability of the perovskite materials and that of the interfaces in PeLED devices. Thus, proper selection of interfacial layers can effectively suppress the degradation pathways at the interfaces.
One of the main origins of degradation in PeLED devices is ion migration caused by electrical stress. The migration of ions can result in their accumulation at the interfaces and form degradation pathways.294,295 Sheng Chen et al. used optical and electro-optical techniques to investigate the degradation of PeLED devices under continuous excitation, as shown in Fig. 15a.295 They found that photoactivated or electroactivated ions accumulated at localized sites and changed carrier dynamics, thus enhancing nonradiative recombination. Besides, ion migration from perovskite films can lead to corrosion of metal electrodes.296–299 Under an electrical field, ions in perovskite films will migrate to metal electrodes, such as Ag and Al, which can be corroded by I− anions, thus forming insulating components (e.g., AgI). PeLED devices can also degrade due to the redox reactions between metal electrodes and Pb2+ cations in perovskite films.300 This degradation pathway only occurs when metal electrodes and perovskite films containing Pb2+ cations are in direct contact and can be accelerated by moisture.

KGaA, Weinheim. 
The diffusion of metallic species from the electrodes is one of the important factors that lead to the degradation of PeLED devices. J. P. Correa-Baena et al. reported that Au could migrate through the HTL into the perovskite materials after exposing the device to a temperature of 70 °C, as shown in Fig. 15c.301 Species such as In and Sn from indium tin oxide (ITO) can also diffuse into perovskite films and accelerate the degradation of PeLED devices by creating luminescence-quenching centers.302
Since the stability of PeLED devices is mainly influenced by electric-field-induced ion migration, it is very important to suppress ion migration to improve the device stability. One of the most effective strategies is inserting ion-blocking interlayers that can block the ion migration and passivate interfacial defects. Lewis bases with electron-donating groups have been demonstrated to be good candidates for the passivation of interfacial defects. N. K. Noel et al. successfully applied the Lewis bases thiophene and pyridine to passivate under-coordinated Pb atoms in the perovskite layer.303 After Lewis base passivation, the nonradiative electron–hole recombination within the perovskite film was significantly reduced. Seungjin Lee et al. reported that amine-based materials such as ethylenediamine (EDA) and polyethylenimine (PEI) effectively passivate the defect sites of the perovskite layer.304 They found the amine-based passivating materials could coordinate bonding between the nitrogen atoms and under-coordinated lead ions. After the solution-processed amine-based passivating materials were spin-coated on top of the perovskite film, EDA and PEI penetrated into the perovskite film, thus passivating the defects. The color of the Ag electrodes did not change, indicating that the introduction of EDA and PEI interlayers effectively prevented ion migration. As a result, the operation lifetime of the passivated PeLED was improved.
4.3 Hole and electron transporting materials
Ideal HTLs/ETLs should have excellent electron/hole blocking ability to suppress nonradiative recombination. The selection of HTLs/ETLs defines the charge carrier injection direction of PeLEDs. The energy barrier between ITO/FTO and perovskite needs to be further reduced for more efficient carrier injection. The most commonly used HTL in PeLED devices is PEDOT:PSS with a deep work function of 5.0–5.2 eV, which matches well with the valence band maximum (VBM) of some perovskite emitters (e.g. MAPbBr3).305 However, some perovskite emitter materials have much deeper valence bands, such as CsPbBr3 (6.18 eV), and as a result, a considerable hole injection barrier at the interface between PEDOT:PSS and emitter. To address this issue, X. Zhang et al. introduced a perfluorinated ionomer (PFI) interlayer between PEDOT:PSS and the perovskite emitter to reduce the energy barrier (Fig. 16b).306 Introduction of the PFI interlayer resulted in a 0.34 eV enhancement in the VBM of the HTL. H. Hu et al. inserted a thin poly-TPD layer between PEDOT:PSS and a quantum well perovskite emitter to achieve effective hole injection.307 TFB can also be used for alignment of the energy levels between PEDOT:PSS and perovskite emitters.8

On the other side, ETLs are applied between cathodes and perovskite emitters to achieve efficient electron injection. Metal oxides such as TiO2 and ZnO have been widely applied in PeLED devices due to their good optical transparency, suitable energy levels, and high charge carrier mobility. In the first report on room-temperature solution-processed PeLED, researchers demonstrated that TiO2 combined with Al2O3 functioned well as an electron injection layer when used in PeLED based on CH3NH3PbI3−xClx.281 However, electron injection from TiO2 to the large bandgap perovskite material CH3NH3PbBr3 is challenging due to the contact barrier at their interface. To solve this problem, M. H. Song et al. applied various surface modifiers, PEI, ethanolamine (EA) and ionic liquid molecules (ILMs), to reduce the contact barrier.307 However, due to the relative hydrophobicity of the ILM- and PEI-treated TiO2, the deposited perovskite film had low coverage. In contrast, a uniform and dense perovskite film with full coverage was achieved on the EA-treated TiO2 surface. The PeLED based on the EA-treated TiO2 demonstrated a maximum luminance of 544.65 cd m−2 (at 5.8 V). Besides TiO2, ZnO has also been applied in PeLED as an ETL. Huang and co-workers demonstrated a solution-processed PeLED using PEIE-modified ZnO as the ETL.310 They obtained a high performance PeLED with the highest EQE of 11.7% and good stability. Z. Shi et al. reported a perovskite QDLED based on a ternary alloy semiconductor, MgZnO, as the ETL with a maximum luminance of 3809 cd m−2 and EQE of 2.39%.311 You and co-workers modified the surface of ZnO using polyvinyl pyrrolidine (PVP) (Fig. 16d).309 After PVP modification, uniform perovskite films with reduced pinholes were obtained because inserting the PVP layer increased the hydrophilicity of the ZnO films, thus resulting in better wetting of the hydrophilic perovskite precursor solution (Table 5).

5 Summary and outlook
We summarized recent developments of organic interfacial materials for perovskite-based optoelectronic devices. Various organic materials were designed and synthesized for hole transporting layers (organometallic, conjugated polymers and small molecules) or electron transporting layers (fullerene derivatives, non-fullerene oligomers and neutral polymers), resulting in the enhancement of charge extraction/injection capability and optoelectronic performance. However, the classical organic materials, spiro-OMeTAD, PEDOT:PSS, and PCBM, are still the obvious choices. Nevertheless, their multi-step synthesis, difficult purification and relatively low electron/hole mobility hinder their large-scale application. Thus, further efforts are needed to design new organic interfacial materials with excellent optoelectronic properties and cost effectiveness. Based on this review, guidance for designing and applying new organic interfacial materials can be formulated as follows:
(1) Combining simulations with experiment is a way to explore and screen new types of organic materials possessing high charge carrier mobility, suitable energy levels, hydrophobicity, good solubility, and low cost.
(2) Using dopant-free organic interfacial materials is an effective method to reduce the reaction between additives and perovskite, enhancing the stability of optoelectronic devices.
(3) Introducing functional groups onto the surface of organic interfacial materials is beneficial for the full coverage and conformal contact between perovskite and interfacial layers, facilitating charge carrier extraction or injection.
(4) Increasing the hydrophobicity of organic interfacial materials can protect perovskite from moisture, improving long-term stability.
(5) Easily synthesized, cost-effective and high-yield organic interfacial materials are also desirable.
Currently, organic interfacial materials for perovskite-based optoelectronic devices are still in need of further development to meet industrial demands, especially for large-scale applications. However, we have witnessed a significant enhancement in the optoelectronic performance in recent years. Organic interfacial materials are critical to achieve high performance optoelectronic devices, not only by providing charge carrier transport but also by passivating the perovskite absorber/emitter and suppressing ion immigration. With strong cross-disciplinary collaboration between chemistry, materials science and device physics, we believe that researchers can solve these challenges in the near future.

Broader context
Organic–inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP)-based optoelectronic devices, which include solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and photodetectors are expected to play an extremely important role in future flexible and printed electronics and can create new applications in the near future. OIHP is one of the most promising classes of low-cost and easily scalable semiconducting active materials, which can be used in various electronic devices. OHIP exhibit outstanding properties including long charge carrier diffusion length, high absorption coefficient, wide-range tunable band gap, and easy solution processability. To harness the OHIP technology for use in devices, there is a great need for interfacial charge transporting layers since they not only boost the performance but also protect the unstable OIHP active layer from degrading in the working environment. In this review, we discuss the molecular and device engineering, optoelectronic properties, and recent research progress in the design of organic interfacial materials for use with OIHP materials in light harvesting, light detection, and display technology.
