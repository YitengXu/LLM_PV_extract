    , Accepted 29th June 2012First published on 29th June 2012AbstractWe report efficient polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and indene–C60 bisadduct (ICBA) with water soluble nickel acetate (NiAc) instead of acidic poly(ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as hole collection layer (HCL). The NiAc layer after thermal annealing at 150 °C for 30 min (α-NiAc) shows high transparency with light transmittance better than PEDOT:PSS in the wavelength range of 500–900 nm, high hole mobility of 1.3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and suitable energy levels for application as HCL. The power conversion efficiency of the PSC based on P3HT/ICBA with the α-NiAc anode buffer layer reached 6.08% under the illumination of AM1.5G 100 mW cm−2, which is among the best efficiencies of the P3HT-based PSCs. This work gives a new option for HCL selection in designing higher efficiency and more stable PSCs.
1. Introduction
Since the bulk heterojunction polymer solar cell (PSC) was reported in 1995,1,2 great efforts have been devoted to optimization of the photovoltaic materials3–7 and devices,8,9 and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSCs has been improved to over 7%.4–9 However, the PSCs are still far from competing with their inorganic counterparts with regard to efficiency and lifetime. In conventional PSCs, one important component is the hole-collection layer (HCL) which extracts holes while concurrently blocks electrons, thereby reducing dark (leakage) current and enhances the open-circuit voltage (Voc).10,11 Poly(ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is an exclusively used HCL, due to its broad applicability, ease of use, and commercial availability.12,13 However, recent studies indicate that the acidic PEDOT:PSS could result in some degradation problem of the PSC devices.14–17 Thus, considerable work has been devoted to develop transition metal oxide HCL materials to overcome the limitation of PEDOT:PSS.
For the HCL materials to replace PEDOT:PSS, some metal oxides, such as MoO3 and NiO etc., have attracted great attention. The majority of studies on nickel oxide (NiO) HCL to date have used vacuum based pulsed laser deposition, electron-beam evaporation, or sputtering,18–23 which is a relative high-cost fabrication process. Very recently, a solution-processed NiOx was demonstrated for the application of hole collection layer in PSC.24 However, the NiOx buffer layer requires relatively high temperature (300 °C) treatment for getting good performance, rendering it incompatible with polymer substrates for future roll-to-roll manufacturing. Therefore, a solution-processable anode modification layer with low-temperature annealing is in great demand for high performance PSCs.
Herein, we report low temperature annealing, solution-processed and commercially available nickel acetate (NiAc) as the hole collection layer for efficient polymer solar cells based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as donor and indene–C60 bisadduct (ICBA)25 as acceptor. Although [6,6]-phenyl-C60-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) is the most widely used acceptor material in PSCs, the low LUMO energy level of PCBM limits the open circuit voltage (Voc) of the P3HT-based PSCs to ca. 0.6 V. ICBA has a LUMO energy level 0.17 eV higher than that of PCBM. Thus, the PSC based on P3HT with ICBA as acceptor shows a higher Voc and higher power conversion efficiency (PCE).25 The NiAc layer was prepared by spin-coating its aqueous solution and then thermal annealing at 150 °C for 30 min. The resultant NiAc layer is highly transparent in the visible range and shows effective hole collection property. The PCE of the PSC with NiAc buffer layer reached 6.08% under the illumination of AM1.5G 100 mW cm−2, which is among the best efficiencies in the P3HT-based PSCs.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass with a sheet resistance of 10 Ω/sq was purchased from CSG HOLDING Co., LTD (China). Nickel acetate tetrahydrate was purchased from Alfa Aesea. Regioregular P3HT was purchased from Rieke Metals. PEDOT:PSS (Clevious P VP AI 4083) was purchased from H. C. Stark company. All these commercial available materials were used as received without further purification. ICBA was synthesized according to ref. 25.
2.2. Measurements and instruments
The transmittance spectra of ITO, ITO/PEDOT:PSS and ITO/NiAc were measured with a Hitachi U-3010 UV-Vis spectrophotometer, PEDOT:PSS film was prepared by spin-coating (2000 rpm) PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution on the pre-cleaned ITO glass. The NiAc film was prepared by spin-coating (4000 rpm) NiAc tetrahydrate aqueous solution (1.5 mg mL−1) on the pre-cleaned ITO glass. Both the PEDOT:PSS and the NiAc films were baked in air at 150 °C for 30 min. The reflectance spectra of NiAc and PEDOT:PSS modified devices were measured with a LAMBDA 950 UV/Vis/NIR Spectrophotometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a Perkin–Elmer 7 thermogravimetric analyzer with a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 under ambient atmosphere. XPS data were obtained with an ESCA Lab220i-XL electron spectrometer from VG Scientific using 300W Al Kα radiation. The base pressure was ca. 3 × 10−9 mbar. The binding energies were referenced to the C1s line at 284.8 eV from adventitious carbon. XRD patterns were obtained with a Siemens D5005 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 20 mA.
2.3. Device fabrication
In order to study the effect of the anode buffer layer on the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs, three types of devices were fabricated with or without PEDOT:PSS or NiAc buffer layer: Device A: glass/ITO/P3HT:ICBA/Ca/Al; Device B: glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:ICBA/Ca/Al and Device C: glass/ITO/NiAc/P3HT:ICBA/Ca/Al. The ITO glass was cleaned by sequential ultrasonic treatment in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol. The pre-cleaned ITO substrate was treated in an ultraviolet-ozone chamber (Ultraviolet Ozone Cleaner, Jelight Company, USA) for 20 min. PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution was filtered through a 0.45 μm filter and spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 60 s on the ITO electrode. Subsequently, the PEDOT:PSS film was baked at 150 °C for 10 min in air. The thickness of the PEDOT:PSS is ca. 30 nm. The NiAc buffer layer was prepared by spin-coating (4000 rpm) a 1.5 wt% nickel acetate tetrahydrate aqueous solution on the pre-cleaned ITO substrate and then baked at 150 °C for 30 min to remove lattice water in air. Subsequently, the substrate was transferred to the nitrogen-filled glove-box, and the photosensitive blend layer was prepared by spin coating (800 rpm) the 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution of P3HT and ICBA (1:1 w/w, polymer concentration of 20 mg mL−1) on the modified ITO electrode for 30 s then drying in covered glass petri dishes for slow growth of the active layer. Finally, the substrate was transferred to a vacuum chamber and 10 nm of Ca and 100 nm of Al was thermally deposited on the photoactive layer under a base pressure of 5 × 10−5 Pa. The active area of the device is ca. 4 mm2.
2.4. Device characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) measurement of the devices was conducted on a computer-controlled Keithley 236 Source Measure Unit (SMU). Device characterization was done in a glove-box under simulated AM1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) using a xenon-lamp-based solar simulator (from Newport Co., LTD). The IPCE was measured using a Stanford Research Systems model SR830 DSP lock-in amplifier coupled with a WDG3 monochromator and 500 W xenon lamp. The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell. All measurements were performed under ambient atmosphere at room temperature.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Thermogravimetric analysis of NiAc precursor
The NiAc hole collection layer (HCL) was prepared from thermal transition of nickel acetate tetrahydrate precursor in air at 150 °C for 30 min. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of nickel acetate tetrahydrate in air atmosphere is shown in Fig. 1. Nickel acetate tetrahydrate shows two discrete weight losses. They are the evaporation of the adsorbed and lattice water, and the decomposition of acetate ions and the residual organic constituents at 40–209 °C and 271–390 °C, respectively.26,27 Obviously, in our case (annealing at 150 °C for 30 min in air), the precursor should only release the lattice water and not become nickel oxide.

3.2. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of NiAc
We measure the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the NiAc samples before and after thermal annealing at 150 °C for 30 min, as shown in Fig. 2, for confirming the structural change of the samples. Fig. 2(a) shows the FTIR spectrum of the untreated precursor. The bands at 1565 and 1419 cm−1 correspond to acetate groups in the molecule as bridging ligands to nickel ions.28,29 The broad absorbance band at 3700–2900 cm−1 corresponds to water of hydration in the precursor.28,29 After annealing in air at 150 °C for 30 min, the absorbance band at 3700–2900 cm−1 is reduced greatly (see Fig. 2(b)), indicating the release of water from the molecule.28,29 The result is in agreement with the weight loss in the TGA plot of the precursor which shows the dehydration at 150 °C. The remaining peak at 3700–3100 cm−1 could be ascribed to the water molecules adsorbed on the sample and the moisture in the atmosphere. In the FTIR spectrum of the NiAc after annealing at 150 °C for 30 min, as shown in Fig. 1(b), there still exist strong characteristic IR absorption peaks of acetate group at 1565 and 1419 cm−1 and no new peaks appear in the entire spectra. These results indicate that the precursor has only lost lattice water and doesn’t decompose into NiO or any other species.

3.3. X-ray photoelectron spectra of NiAc
Further evidence for the purity and composition of the NiAc sample after thermal annealing at 150 °C for 30 min in air was obtained by X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), as shown in Fig. 3. For the convenience of discussion, the NiAc sample after thermal annealing at 150 °C for 30 min in air is denoted as α-NiAc. The survey XPS spectra performed in the 0–1000 eV binding energy (BE) range (Fig. 3a) shows that the α-NiAc sample has a clean surface with only Ni, C, and O elements. The doublet of Ni 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 transitions in the 850–890 eV region is shown in Fig. 3b. The main peak at ca. 855.5 eV with a intense satellite at ca. 861.2 eV for Ni 2p1/2 and the peak at ca. 873.6 eV with a intense satellite at ca. 879.5 eV for Ni 2p3/2 are both characteristic of Ni2+ ion.27,30,31 Most importantly, the C 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 3c) displays only two distinct peaks at BE around 288.2 and 284.6 eV which correspond to the carboxylate group and adventitious carbon, respectively.27 Furthermore, there is only one symmetric peak at 531.8 eV for O 1s (Fig. 3d), which could correspond to the oxygen from carboxylate group.32 From the characteristic binding energy values of Ni, C and O, we can confirm that nickel acetate tetrahydrate precursor released its lattice water during the annealing at 150 °C for 30 min in air, and there is no NiO or any other species formation. This is in agreement with the FTIR result mentioned above.

3.4. Transmittance, crystallization and hole mobility of α-NiAc
The α-NiAc layer is highly transparent in the visible range as shown in Fig. 4a, which will benefit light harvesting. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, as shown in Fig. 4(b), indicates that α-NiAc has an amorphous structure. The hole mobility of the α-NiAc layer is ca. 1.3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, measured by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method (the inset of Fig. 4b). The high hole mobility of the α-NiAc layer is preferred for the application as hole collection layer in the PSCs.

The red line is the fit to the experimental points. 
3.5. Structure design of the PSCs
The sandwiched structure of glass/ITO/α-NiAc/P3HT:ICBA/Ca/Al is employed in the fabrication of the PSCs, with ITO as positive electrode, NiAc as hole collection interface layer, P3HT:ICBA as photoactive layer, and Ca/Al as negative electrode. The device structure of PSC and the molecular structures of P3HT, ICBA and NiAc are shown in Fig. 5(a).
 Fig. 5  (a) Device structure of the polymer solar cells and the molecular structures of P3HT, ICBA and NiAc. (b) The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the materials involved in the PSCs. 

Fig. 5(b) shows the energy levels of the materials involved in the PSCs. The energy level of α-NiAc was determined by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry. The electronic energy levels of P3HT,33 and ICBA25 were taken from the literatures. When light irradiates on the photoactive layer of the PSCs through the ITO electrode, the active layer will absorb photons to produce excitons, and the excitons will diffuse towards and dissociate at the P3HT/ICBA interface into electrons in the LUMO (the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) of the acceptor ICBA and holes in the HOMO (the highest occupied molecular orbital) of the donor P3HT. Since the HOMO level (−5.11 eV) of α-NiAc is 0.35 eV lower than that of P3HT, holes can easily transport to the ITO electrode through α-NiAc. However, the LUMO level (−2.68 eV) of α-NiAc is greatly higher than that (−3.74 eV) of ICBA, so it blocks the electron transport from ICBA to the ITO electrode. Thus, from the viewpoint of energy levels, the device could show high charge collection efficiency on both electrodes.34
3.6. Morphology of the thin films
The tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) image of bare ITO is illustrated in Fig. 6a. The root mean square (rms) roughness of the ITO surface is 4.8 nm. After modification with α-NiAc layer, the surface becomes more flat and the rms roughness is decreased to 2.1 nm (see Fig. 6e), which is comparable with that (1.8 nm) of PEDOT:PSS modified ITO substrate as shown in Fig. 6c. Fig. 6b shows the AFM image of the surface of the P3HT:ICBA active layer on bare ITO substrate with a rms roughness of 17.1 nm. While the rms roughness of the P3HT:ICBA active layer on the α-NiAc modified ITO substrate is 15.9 nm (see Fig. 6f), which is a little higher than that (13.7 nm) of the surface of the P3HT:ICBA on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate (see Fig. 6d). Obviously, the roughness of the substrate can affect the roughness of the active layer spin-cast on it. Another finding is that the P3HT:ICBA layer has much larger roughness than that of the substrate, regardless of whether the substrate was modified with NiAc or PEDOT:PSS or nothing. The increase in roughness is attributed to P3HT self-organization and phase separation of the blend. P3HT chains self-organizing into an ordered structure can significantly enhance hole mobility. Meanwhile, the aggregation of ICBA molecules can form separate paths for electron transport.35 The nanoscale phase separation can finally result in the enhancement of Jsc of the PSCs.35

3.7. Effect of α-NiAc HCL on the performance of PSCs
To investigate the effect of the α-NiAc HCL on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, we design three types of devices: (A) ITO/P3HT:ICBA (220 nm)/Ca (10 nm)/Al (100 nm), (B) ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/P3HT:ICBA (220 nm)/Ca (10 nm)/Al (100 nm), and (C) ITO/α-NiAc (15 nm)/P3HT:ICBA (220 nm)/Ca (10 nm)/Al (100 nm). For the current density–voltage (J–V) curves measured with a computer-controlled Keithley 236 Source Measure Unit (SMU) in the dark, the rectification ratios at ±1.0 V for Device A and B are 2.32 × 102, 2.07 × 103, respectively. However, that of Device C with α-NiAc buffer layer reaches 2.42 × 103, which is one order higher than that of Device A without HCL and is a little higher than that of Device B with PEDOT:PSS HCL. The higher rectification ratio of the α-NiAc based Device C results from the higher injection current at the positive voltage and lower leakage current at the negative voltage.

J–V curves of Device A, B, and C under the illumination of AM1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 7a and the device performance parameters (average of 12 devices) are summarized in Table 1. Device A without HCL shows a PCE of 4.41%, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 9.66 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.84 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 55.4%. In contrast, the parameters, Jsc, FF, and PCE, of Device C with α-NiAc HCL are all enhanced to 11.74 mA cm−2, 66.4%, and 6.08%, respectively. In comparison with Device B with PEDOT:PSS HCL, the Jsc is increased by 23.3%, while the Voc and FF are slightly decreased, and the overall PCE is almost the same. The higher Jsc of Device C could be ascribed to the enhanced spatial redistribution of light intensity inside the device caused by the α-NiAc buffer layer.36,37

The slightly decreased FF of Device C with α-NiAc HCL, in comparison with Device B with PEDOT:PSS HCL, could result from the increase in series resistance (Rs) from 3.6 Ω cm2 to 4.7 Ω cm2, and slightly decreased parallel resistance (Rp) from 42.8 K Ω cm2 to 41.5 K Ω cm2, respectively.38 The lower Voc of Device C could be explained as follows: For organic bulk heterojunction solar cells with Ohmic contact between the active layer and metal electrodes, Voc is determined by the energy difference between the LUMO of the acceptor and the HOMO of the donor as well as the sum of the voltage losses at each contact due to the band bending (q(Voc + ΔVb) = HOMOdonor − LUMOacceptor).39 In this work, the donor and acceptor materials are the same for all devices. The decreased Voc for NiAc based device C could be ascribed to the larger voltage lose at photoactive-layer/NiAc interface because of the higher HOMO level (−5.11 eV) of α-NiAc than that (−5.20 eV) of PEDOT:PSS. Further investigation to minimize this energy loss is currently in progress.
In order to investigate the effect of the interfacial layer on light distribution within the film, we compared the incident photon to converted current efficiency (IPCE) spectra and the reflectance spectra of α-NiAc and PEDOT:PSS modified devices in Fig. 8. As shown in Fig. 8b, the intensity of reflectance for the α-NiAc modified device is generally lower than that of the PEDOT:PSS modified device. Furthermore, we derived the additional absorption, Δα from the two reflectance spectra by the equation36 Δα = − ln(RNiAc/RPEDOT:PSS) to quantify the difference of absorption over the whole wavelength of the visible range, where RNiAc is the light intensity reflected from the α-NiAc modified device and RPEDOT:PSS is that for the PEDOT:PSS modified device. The shape of Δα in the inset of Fig. 8b indicates an additional absorption happening over the whole wavelength of the absorption spectrum in Device C in comparison with Device B. Therefore, the enhanced photocurrent in the α-NiAc modified device is partly attributed to the additional absorption of the photo active layer. The IPCE results (Fig. 8a) agree with the additional absorption in the reflectance spectra and the Jsc of the PSCs mentioned above. The higher IPCE of Device C at wavelength over 500 nm could also be ascribed to the slightly increased transmittance of ITO/α-NiAc (see Fig. 4a) and the good crystallized morphology of blend film as shown in Fig. 6. It should be mentioned that although the transmittance of ITO/α-NiAc in the wavelength range of 350–500 nm is poorer than that of ITO/PEDOT:PSS, the IPCE of Device C is similar to that of Device B in the wavelength range, which could result from the overall light redistribution of the incident light in the active layer of the devices as shown in the reflection spectra in Fig. 8(b).

Insets: schematic illustrations of the incident light path in a completed device and the additional absorption spectrum resulting from the difference of reflectance spectra for α-NiAc and PEDOT:PSS HCL modified PSCs. 
The long term stability of non-encapsulated PSCs with α-NiAc and PEDOT:PSS HCL were investigated by testing the PCE degradation with time in a nitrogen filled glove-box, and the results are shown in Fig. 9. The PCE of the α-NiAc modified devices only decay by approximately 3% of the original value after storage in nitrogen for two weeks (336 h), while that of the PEDOT:PSS modified devices decay by approximately 10% of the original value after storage in nitrogen for the same time. These results indicate that the non-acidic α-NiAc HCL can effectively improve the long term stability of the PSCs.

4. Conclusion
We demonstrate efficient polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on P3HT:ICBA using water soluble NiAc instead of acidic PEDOT:PSS as hole collection layer (HCL). The α-NiAc layer with thermal annealing at 150 °C for 30 min in air is highly transparent, and shows high hole mobility and effective hole collection property. The FTIR and XPS study indicate that nickel acetate tetrahydrate precursor only releases the lattice water during the thermal annealing. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSC with the α-NiAc HCL reaches 6.08% under the illumination of AM1.5G 100 mW cm−2, which is among the best values of the PSCs based on P3HT. This work gives a new option for HCL selection in designing higher efficiency and more stable PSCs.
