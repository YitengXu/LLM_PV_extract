    , Accepted 5th February 2019First published on 5th February 2019AbstractRecently, Ag–Bi–I system has attracted significant attention as an emergent material for absorbers in solar cells. We have investigated the single-phase compositions, analyzed the detailed crystal structures, measured optical and electronic properties, and determined the structure–property relations of Ag2−3xBixI2. Single-phase samples with CdCl2-type rhombohedral structures were obtained with Ag-rich compositions (x = 0.45–0.48), while defect-spinel-type cubic structures were stabilized with Bi-rich compositions (x = 0.52–0.57). Both the rhombohedral and cubic structures consisted of the cubic close-packed I-ion sublattices, and the small difference in the Ag/Bi composition resulted in distinct crystal structures. Both the CdCl2-type rhombohedral and defect-spinel-type cubic compounds exhibited semiconducting behavior with proper band gap energies, which indicates that both materials are potentially useful as absorbers in solar cells. The rhombohedral structure compounds have shallower valence band energies, larger indirect band gap energies, and higher electrical conductivity with lower activation energy than the cubic structure compounds. The distinct properties result from the difference in the defect structures, additional Ag occupation in the rhombohedral phase and deficiencies of the octahedral site in the cubic phase.
Introduction
Methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3), as an emergent optoelectronic material, has attracted much attention. One of the most promising applications of the compound is in solar cells. Its power conversion efficiency (PCE) has risen rapidly and now exceeds 22%.1 However, its instability under atmospheric conditions and the high toxicity of the constituent lead are major concerns for the commercialization of this material. Accordingly, lead-free materials with high stability in air are in strong demand, and extensive attempts have been made to substitute other metals, such as Sn, Ge, Sb, and Bi, for the Pb in perovskite-related structures. Although compounds such as MASnI3 and MAGeI3 have shown photovoltaic properties, a good PCE has not yet been achieved.2–6
Among such lead-free candidate materials, Bi-containing materials are an interesting class of materials. Some of the halides such as (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9, M3Bi2I9 (M = Cs, Rb, K), (H3NC6H12NH3)BiI5, and (NH4)3Bi2I9 were reported to have band gaps that were too wide (>2 eV) for application as solar absorbers.7–10 Moreover, a recent study showed that AgBi2I7 thin films with a band gap of about 1.87 eV exhibit photovoltaic properties.11 AgBiI4 was also shown to have an indirect band gap of 1.63 eV with p-type low conduction carriers.12 Therefore, the exploration of novel halides containing both Ag and Bi has thus accelerated. Although several ternary Ag–Bi–I compounds with nominal compositions of AgBiI4, Ag2BiI5, Ag3BiI6, and AgBi2I7 were reported, some of the results are controversial, and the chemical composition and crystal structure of each compound have not been clarified in detail.
The AgI–BiI3 system was first studied by Fourcroy et al., who found that Ag2BiI5 and AgBi2I7 crystallized as hexagonal and cubic structures, respectively.13 Dzeranova et al. then reported two ternary compounds with different compositions, AgBiI4 and Ag3BiI6.14 Odag et al. analyzed the crystal structures of AgBiI4 and Ag3BiI6, which were synthesized by a solvothermal method and found that AgBiI4 crystallized as a Fdm cubic structure and Ag3BiI6 crystallized as a Rm hexagonal structure.15 However, they also found significant cation disorder in both compounds, and the refined compositions from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) structure analysis were not consistent with the nominal compositions. The structure–composition relation was thus difficult to establish. When the AgI–BiI3 phase diagram was recently re-examined, two intermediate phases, γ (based on Ag2BiI5) and δ (based on AgBi2I7), were identified.16 However, the structure–property relationships in the AgI–BiI3 system have not been established.
In the present study, we carefully investigated the phase relations in Ag–Bi–I compounds with the general formula Ag2−3xBixI2. We obtained single-phase samples with a CdCl2-type rhombohedral structure and a defect-spinel-type cubic structure, and characterized each single phase region. The structural relationship between the two phases is discussed in detail. The measured optical and electrical properties of each single-phase compound are presented and the structure–property relationships are also discussed.
Experimental
Compounds with the general formula Ag2−3xBixI2 were prepared by solid-state reaction. The compositions were varied with 0.33 ≤ x ≤ 0.60 to cover the range of compositions of the previously reported compounds (Fig. 1). AgI and BiI3 were well mixed and placed in vacuum-sealed silica tubes that were then heated in a furnace. The tubes were heated at 610 °C for 1 day, followed by 350 °C for 5 days, and they were then quickly taken out of the furnace.
 Fig. 1  Composition range studied in the present study. Compounds with previously reported specific nominal compositions are also shown. 
Phase identification of the obtained samples was performed with a conventional XRD method. Detailed crystal structures were analyzed using synchrotron XRD (SXRD) data. The SXRD measurements at room temperature were conducted at the beamline BL02B2 in SPring-8 with a wavelength of 0.5996871 Å and at the TPS09A beamline in Taiwan photon source with a wavelength of 0.61992 Å. Powder samples were packed into a 0.1 mm glass capillary tube to minimize absorption and were rotated during the measurement. The obtained data were analyzed with the Rietveld method using the program RIETAN-VENUS.17
The optical properties of each single-phase sample were analyzed with photoelectron and UV-visible absorption spectroscopy. Valence band energy (Ev) levels of the samples were determined by measuring the photoelectron spectra. The powder samples were placed into sample holders and exposed to 10 nW light. The spectra were recorded in the range of 4–7 eV. Optical band gaps (Eg) were measured using UV-visible spectroscopy. Samples consisting of a small amount of powder dispersed on glass slides were exposed to light in the energy (E) range from 0.99 eV to 3.10 eV to measure reflectance (R) and transmittance (T). Absorbance (A) was calculated using the formula A = −log(T/(1 − R)). The obtained spectra were analyzed using Tauc plots, (A × E)rvs. E.
AC electrical conductivity at a fixed frequency of 100 kHz was measured with a circular pellet, 10 mm in diameter and 1.3 mm thick. Conducting silver paint was used as the electrodes. The measurements were performed under N2 gas to a temperature of 100 °C at a rate of ∼1 °C min−1.
Results and discussion
The SXRD patterns of the as-synthesized samples are shown in Fig. 2. The results show that single-phase samples were obtained in the composition ranges of 0.45 ≤ x ≤ 0.48 and 0.52 ≤ x ≤ 0.57. The diffraction pattern of each sample with a composition of 0.45 ≤ x ≤ 0.48 is indexed with a rhombohedral unit cell. The samples with the composition of 0.33 ≤ x < 0.45 contain AgI in addition to the rhombohedral phase. For the compositions of 0.52 ≤ x ≤ 0.57, another single-phase diffraction pattern appears, which is reproduced by a cubic structural model. For the further Bi-rich composition range (0.57 < x), BiI3 is included, and obtaining single-phase samples proved difficult. The results indicate that there are no single phases with nominal compositions Ag3BiI6 (x = 0.33), Ag2BiI5 (x = 0.40), and AgBiI4 (x = 0.50), which were reported previously, and only AgBi2I7 (x = 0.57) gave a single phase diffraction pattern. The present results are in agreement with the phase diagram reported by Mashadieva et al., where only γ (based on Ag2BiI5) and δ (based on AgBi2I7) phases exist in the composition range.16 It can thus be concluded that Ag-rich compositions stabilize the rhombohedral structure, while the Bi-rich compositions stabilize the cubic structure.

The crystal structures of the obtained single phase samples were then analyzed by the Rietveld method with the SXRD data. Fig. 3 shows typical examples of the results for the rhombohedral phase (x = 0.45; Ag0.65Bi0.45I2) and the cubic phase (x = 0.55; Ag0.35Bi0.55I2). Their refined structural parameters are listed in Table 1. The observed diffraction pattern of Ag0.65Bi0.45I2 is well reproduced with a CdCl2-type crystal structure model with the space group Rm. The structure consists of a cubic close-packed I-ion sublattice, as shown in Fig. 4. The Ag and Bi ions occupy the 3a edge-sharing octahedral sites, and the site is fully occupied with the refined occupancies of Ag/Bi = 0.554(4)/0.446(4). Because no superstructure reflections were observed in the diffraction patterns of these compounds, there was no ordering of Ag and Bi ions at the site. A small amount of Ag occupation (0.070(3)) is detected at the 3b sites in the refinement. The refined composition from the structure analysis is Ag0.624Bi0.446I2, which agrees well with the synthetic composition. The (Ag/Bi)–I bond length in the octahedron is 3.0786(7) Å, which is smaller than the expected lengths of ionic bonds consisting of Ag+ (1.15 Å), Bi3+ (1.03 Å), and I− (2.2 Å), suggesting a covalent nature of the compound. The length of the Ag(3b)–I bond sandwiched by the (Ag/Bi)I6 octahedral layers is 3.0373(6) Å, which is slightly less than that of the (Ag/Bi)–I bond. The diffraction pattern of Ag0.35Bi0.55I2, on the other hand, is reproduced with a cubic spinel-type structure model with the space group Fdm. This structure is also based on the cubic close-packed I-ion sublattices along the cubic [1 1 1] direction. The tetrahedral site in the spinel structure is completely vacant, indicating the defect-type. Both Ag and Bi ions occupy the 16c edge-sharing octahedral sites, but the total occupancy of the site is less than unity (∼0.91), indicating a cation deficiency at the site. No ordering of the Ag and Bi ions is confirmed. The refined composition is Ag0.3537Bi0.5558I2, which is also consistent with the synthesis composition. The (Ag/Bi)–I bond length in the edge-sharing octahedron is 3.0835(5) Å, which is slightly greater than that in the rhombohedral phase.

 Fig. 4  Crystal structures of the (a) CdCl2-type rhombohedral phase and (b) defect-spinel-type cubic phase. The green, pink, and blue spheres represent Ag+, Bi3+, and I− ions, respectively. 
Interestingly, the tetrahedral site in the spinel-type structure is completely vacant. Because the Ag+ and Bi3+ ions are too large to occupy the site, Ag2−3xBixI2 cannot crystallize in the spinel-type structure when x < 0.5. In contrast, the octahedral 3b site in the CdCl2-type structure is large enough to accommodate the Ag+ and Bi3+ ions. Ag2−3xBixI2 (x < 0.5) thus crystallizes in the CdCl2-type structure. The phase transformation in the Ag2−3xBixI2 system is therefore a size effect with the phase boundary at about x = 0.5.
Typical photoelectron spectroscopy results are shown in Fig. 5, and the Ev levels obtained from the single-phase samples are summarized in Table 2. The Ev levels for the rhombohedral phase are −6.12 eV to −6.13 eV, while those for the cubic phase are −6.36 to −6.41 eV. As shown in the UV-visible absorption spectra in Fig. 6, the rhombohedral phase shows an absorption onset at around 1.5 eV. The relatively steep and significant increase at the onset energy ∼1.5 eV is quite suitable for photovoltaic applications. The cubic phase, on the other hand, exhibits two absorption onsets at ∼1.2 eV and ∼1.7 eV. The high energy absorption onset ∼1.7 eV is close to the experimentally observed values reported previously.11,12,18,19 The observed low energy absorption ∼1.2 eV in the cubic phase can be assigned to an indirect band gap energy or defect states. Based on the indirect band gaps for the Ag2−3xBixI2 system,20,21 the Tauc plot analyses (A × E)0.5vs. E give the energies of 1.50 eV for the rhombohedral phase and 1.11 eV for the cubic phase. The results for the other single-phase samples are listed in Table 2, and it can be concluded that the indirect band gap energies of the rhombohedral phase are larger than those of the cubic phase.

 Fig. 6  (a) Absorption spectra of rhombohedral Ag0.65Bi0.45I2 and cubic Ag0.35Bi0.55I2 and (b) the corresponding Tauc plot assuming an indirect transition. The dotted lines are the linear extrapolation, and the extrapolated indirect band gap energies are listed in Table 2. The data at 1.36–1.47 eV is missing due to a measurement detector change. 
Despite the variation in the Ag and Bi composition ratio, the valence band and band gap energies of each phase do not show significant changes. This implies that the difference in the optical properties mainly originate from the difference between the rhombohedral and cubic phase crystal structures. The valence bands of the compounds mainly consist of Ag-4d and I-5p states,12 and the contribution from the Ag(3b)–I bonds causes the valence band energy to increase, giving a slightly shallower valence band level for the rhombohedral phase. The smaller indirect band gap energies for the cubic phase should be related to the deficiency at the 16c edge-sharing octahedral site. A similar absorption onset was indeed reported in M3Bi2I9 (M+ = K+, Rb+, Cs+, NH4+, CH3NH3+) with cation-deficient BiI6 octahedral sites.8,22–26
The AC electrical conductivity of each single-phase sample increases with increasing temperature, suggesting semiconducting properties of the materials, which is consistent with the UV-visible spectroscopy results. Although possible ionic conduction may be included in the conductivity behavior, the observed behavior at the measured temperature range essentially originates from the electronic conduction. The phase stability after the conductivity measurements was also confirmed. In fact, each structure phase is stable up to ∼130 °C, which was also confirmed from the temperature variable XRD measurements (data are not shown). The conductivity of the rhombohedral Ag0.65Bi0.45I2 is higher than that of the cubic Ag0.35Bi0.55I2. The Arrhenius plots for the temperature dependence of the conductivity are shown in Fig. 7. The activation energy for the rhombohedral Ag0.65Bi0.45I2 obtained from the plots (10.89 kJ mol−1) is lower than that for the cubic Ag0.35Bi0.55I2 (25.77 kJ mol−1). The shallower valence band level for the rhombohedral phase lowers the activation energy for electron hopping, making the conductivity higher than that of the cubic phase. Cation defects in the three-dimensional network of the spinel crystal structure may prevent the high conduction of the hopping electrons.

Conclusions
We prepared Ag2−3xBixI2 (x = 0.33–0.60) by solid-state reaction and investigated the composition–structure relationship. We found from the SXRD analysis that the Ag-rich compositions yielded the rhombohedral phase, and the single phase was obtained in the composition range of 0.45 ≤ x ≤ 0.48, while the Bi-rich compositions yielded the cubic phase, and the single phase was obtained with 0.52 ≤ x ≤ 0.57. The rhombohedral phase crystallized as a CdCl2-type Rm crystal. The Ag and Bi ions fully occupied the edge-sharing octahedral sites in a disordered manner, and additional Ag ions occupied the sites between the (Ag/Bi)I6 octahedral layers. The cubic phase had a cubic defect-spinel-type Fm crystal structure, where the tetrahedral sites were completely vacant, and the Ag and Bi ions partially occupied the edge-sharing octahedral sites. Both structures consisted of the cubic close-packed I-ion sublattices; thus, the small difference in the Ag/Bi composition resulted in the distinct crystal structures.
Both rhombohedral and cubic Ag2−3xBixI2 exhibited semiconducting qualities with indirect band gaps. The rhombohedral structure compounds had shallower valence band energies, larger indirect band gaps, and higher electrical conduction with lower activation energies than the cubic structure compounds. Defects such as additional Ag occupation in the rhombohedral phase and the deficiencies of the octahedral site in the cubic phase played important roles in the distinct properties.
Both the CdCl2-type rhombohedral compounds and defect-spinel-type cubic structure compounds are potentially useful as absorbers in solar cells. Comparing the properties of the present single-phase samples reveals that the Ag-rich rhombohedral compounds would be better absorbers than the Bi-rich cubic compounds.
