    , Accepted 18th March 2011First published on 1st April 2011AbstractAnnulated thiophene perylene bisimides and their triphenyl-amine based oligomers have been synthesized. One of the oligomers FPTTPA has been demonstrated to be an efficient electron donor in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells, giving a power conversion efficiency of 1.42%.

Perylene bisimides (PBIs) represent a class of thermally stable organic semiconductors with high extinction coefficients, high photostabilities and high quantum yields.1 They have shown wide applications such as in field-effect transistors,2electron transfer cascades,3 photovoltaic devices,4 and dye lasers.5 PBIs are also potential candidates as organic solar cells since they have been found to possess excellent electron affinities and mobilities.6 Recently, the extension of the aromatic core of PBI has been intensively studied for n-type semi-conductors and NIR dyes.7 Extension of the aromatic unit along the long molecular axis such as in 2 and 3 induced a bathochromic shift of about 100 nm per addition of naphthalene unit.8  
Annulation of PBIs with a variety of cyclic units in the bay region has been actively investigated.9 Such core-expanded perylenedyes include annulated dibenzocoronenebis(dicarboximide)410 and diverse heterocycles such as pyridyl-,11sulfur-,12 and N-heterocycles13 substituted PBI. However, the above annulated PBIs hamper further applications because they do not have specific substitution sites for any structural modifications. Therefore, we envisioned that if from the thiophene annulations of PBI1 compounds such as 5 could be synthesized, they could be utilized for the synthesis of electronic materials through the incorporation of numerous electron-rich or electron-deficient chromospheres to the annulated thiophene unit.
In this communication, we report the synthesis of the annulated thiophene perylene bisimide, its electron-rich derivatives and its applications for organic solar cells.
The three oligomeric molecules FPTTPA, FP3HTTPA, and PTPA have been efficiently synthesized by the stepwise synthetic protocol illustrated in Scheme 1. The Suzuki coupling reaction14 of 1,7-dibromoperylenebis(dicarboximide)s with thiophene-3-ylboronic acid led to 7. Photocyclization in the presence of I2 yielded the thiophene annulated PBI5. Bromination of 5 with Br2 gave 8. FPTTPA and FP3HTTPA were prepared from 8 with compound 9 and compound 10 by a Suzuki reaction, respectively. For comparison, the triphenyl amine moiety was connected at 1, 7 bay positions of perylene bisimide to give PTPA.
 Scheme 1  
Reagents: (i) thiophene-3-ylboronic acid, Pd(PPh3)4, K2CO3, THF; (ii) I2, hν, dichloromethane; (iii) Br2, CH2Cl2; (iv) for R = H, compound 9; for R = hexyl, compound 10, Pd(PPh3)4, K2CO3, THF; (v) compound 11, Pd(PPh3)4, K2CO3, THF. 

Optical absorption spectra of FPTTPA, FP3HTTPA, and PTPA in CH2Cl2 and in films are shown in Fig. 1. The absorption spectrum of PTPA showed two broad maxima at 420 and 523 nm. The short wavelength absorption at 420 nm is associated with the characteristic perylene transition, while the long wavelength absorption at 523 nm corresponds to an intramolecular charge transfer between the TPA-thiophene donor part and the acceptor perylenegroup. Comparison of the spectra of the three compounds shows that the absorption maximum of FPTTPA and FP3HTTPA in the long wavelength is bathochromically shifted by 50 and 40 nm compared with that of PTPA, respectively, as a result of the more planar conformation. The FPTTPA/C61-PCBM film has three broad absorption bands, which span a wide range of the UV and visible spectrum from 300 to 680 nm (see S1 in the ESI†). Such a broad spectrum makes FPTTPA a potential compound for organic solar cells.

Electrochemical properties of the three compounds FPTTPA, FP3HTTPA, and PTPA were investigated by cyclovoltammetry. All three compounds exhibited two reversible oxidation potentials. The oxidation potentials of PTPA are lower by about 250 mV than those of FPTTPA and FP3HTTPA, indicating a significant HOMO-raising effect. FPTTPA showed a large positive shift in its redox potential, rendering oxidation more difficult due to the electron delocalization on a relative planar configuration. Compounds FPTTPA and PTPA exhibited two reversible reduction potentials, whereas FP3HTTPA exhibited one irreversible reduction potential at −1.38 V. The first reduction potential of FPTTPA is 0.21 eV lower than that of FP3HTTPA, indicating stronger electron accepting power, which makes it a potential p-type material for organic solar cells (see S2 in the ESI†).
The HOMO and LUMO levels of the three compounds were calculated to be −4.98 to −5.27 and −3.33 to −3.55 eV, respectively. In comparison with the HOMO level of −6.1 eV and LUMO level of −3.7 eV of PCBM, the three compounds are suitable for use as donor materials blended with PCBM as the acceptor in organic solar cells.
Solution processable small molecule semiconductors as alternatives to conjugated polymers in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells are subject to a considerable current interest.15 Therefore, we adopted the triphenylamine-based oligomers incorporating an annulated perylene unit as donor materials for organic solar cells because the compounds have broad absorptions and high extinction coefficients as well as the proper energy difference in the LUMO of the donor and acceptor used as the active layer.
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells were fabricated by spin-coatingperylene∶PCBM (weight ratio = 1∶2, perylene = FPTTPA, FP3HTTPA, and PTPA) blends in chlorobenzene onto cleaned indiumtin oxide (ITO), deposited by first spin-coating with PEDOT∶PSS [poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene)∶polystyrenesulfonate] (layer thickness: 40 nm). The thickness of an active layer was 40 nm. After the cells were completely dried, vacuum deposition of Al (∼ 100 nm) as the cathode was conducted.

Fig. 2a shows the J–V curves of devices based on the three compounds. A summary of photovoltaic properties is listed in Table 1. The device with a 1∶2 weight ratio of FPTTPA to PCBM gave the best performance with a power conversion efficiency (η) of 1.42% which is significantly higher than the other two devices based on FP3HTTPA and PTPA. The devices based on FPTTPA and FP3HTTPA exhibited a higher Voc of 0.78–0.96 V compared to the device based on PTPA, which is in agreement with the higher HOMO level of both compounds. The Jsc enhancement of the FPTTPA∶PCBM blend relative to the other two blends can be related to the charge carrier mobility. In order to confirm our results, space charge current limited measurements in dark were carried out on the three blend layer. The hole and electron mobilities of the FPTTPA∶PCBM device were calculated to be μh = 364 × 10−6 and μe = 6.42 × 10−4, whereas those of PTPA∶PCBM were sharply decreased to μh = 1.28 × 10−6 and μe = 2.74 × 10−6 (see S4 in the ESI†). The increased mobility of charge carriers and balanced charge transport in the FPTPA∶PCBM device led to the large enhancement in the power conversion efficiency.

Fig. 2b shows the IPCE curves based on the three devices. The shape of the curves is quite similar to the corresponding absorption spectra of three blend films (see ESI†), which indicates that the visible spectrum of the blend contributed to the power conversion efficiency.
The maximum quantum efficiency of the device based on the FPTTPA∶PCBM blend reached 47% at 435 nm.

Fig. 3 shows AFM images of the blend films of FPTTPA and PTPA with PCBM. In the image of FPTTPA∶PCBM blends, randomly distributed islands are connected to each other and demonstrate interpenetrating networks. In contrast, the PTPA∶PCBM blend shows large segregation of each phase. The good photovoltaic performance obtained with FPTTPA as the donor should be ascribed to the synergistic effects of its enhanced absorption and good quality uniform film due to a planar configuration.

In summary, three types of novel perylene-based oligomers were synthesized and used as the electron donors in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells. The overall power conversion efficiency of the ITO/PEDOT∶PSS/FPTTPA∶PCBM (1∶2 wt% ratio)/Al device is 1.42%. The high efficiency of the device is attributed to the improved light harvesting, balanced charge transport, and good morphology. These results provide a potential design strategy for developing novel electron donor oligomers or polymers with high photovoltaic performance through sophisticated structural modifications.
