Photovoltaic performance depends on the orientation of the fused thiophene subunits, which is related to the different semiconducting properties and phase separation. Without special device treatments, P3 showed power conversion efficiencies of up to 7.50% with the highest short-circuit current (Jsc = 18.2 mA cm−2) so far reported for TPD polymers.
During the last decade, conjugated copolymers designed with alternating donor/acceptor (D/A) or quinoid (D–Q, Q: quinoid-enhancing moieties) approaches have been intensively explored, leading to substantial progresses in the field of polymer solar cells (PSCs).1 Several mid-bandgap (MBG) copolymers2 with typical optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of approximately 1.7 eV have delivered promising power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 8% in a conventional device structure.3 Further increasing the PCEs requires the development of low-bandgap (LBG) polymers with Eoptg of approximately 1.5 eV for utilizing solar energy in the near-infrared (near-IR) region.4 Thus far, the development of high-performance LBG-type polymers has been lagging behind that of MBG polymers, and 2,5-dialkyl-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP)-containing polymers are representative LBG polymers because of the strong electron-withdrawing ability of the DPP acceptor.5 The development of LBG-polymers with optimized electronic energy levels is currently enslaved to the scarcity of effective acceptor units just like DPP.6
The thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) motif7 is viewed as one of the most valuable electron-deficient moieties available for the construction of MBG-polymers (Eoptg: ca. 1.8 eV), by copolymerization with weakly electron-donating benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT),8 giving high PCEs of up to 8.5% with a moderate Jsc of approximately 12.6 mA cm−2.3a Because of the less electron-deficient properties of TPD than of DPP, LBG TPD-polymers were rarely studied, which, however, is important for further enhancing Jsc and may result in better photovoltaic performance.7,3a The incorporation of electron-rich moieties, such as N-alkyl-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP), reduces the optical bandgaps of TPD polymers to 1.59 eV, but leads to an even lower PCE (1.69% and Jsc = 4.69 mA cm−2).9 A novel acceptor combination consisting of two TPDs or TPD with other acceptor units was also developed by Leclerc et al. for modulating energy levels.10 By regioselectively inserting TT, an important moiety used in the quinoid strategy,11 into BDT (donor) and TPD (acceptor) units, we designed two kinds of TPD polymers with low Eoptg of approximately 1.5 eV, PBDTTEH–TBTTEH-i (P1) and PBDTTEH–TBTTEH-o (P2) with different regiochemical features (Fig. 1). TBTTs, TPD flanked with two unsymmetrical TT moieties regioselectively, are the key π-building blocks for the construction of P1–P3 and are reported by us for high-performance n-type organic semiconductors.12 We found that the PSC performance was sensitive to the orientation of the fused thiophene units, with maximum PCEs of 6.06% (P1) vs. 4.21% (P2) under optimized conditions in a conventional device setup, which can be attributed to the inferior phase separation and carrier transporting ability of P2. The inverted device based on P1 furnished a short-circuit current (Jsc) up to 18 mA cm−2, resulting in a higher PCE of 6.70%. Given that the aliphatic side chains usually play a vital role in the device performance,3a,13 we explored the use of P3, with 2-hexyldecyl (HD) groups on the TPD unit, and found that this polymer could be used to further tune the thin-film morphology and afford PCEs of up to 7.50% without additives and thermal annealing, which favors the need for industrial production of OSC materials.
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures of TBTT-based polymers. 
TBTTs were synthesized according to our reported method.12 The maximum absorptions of TBTTs were markedly bathochromically shifted compared with those of TBT (ca. 70 nm), with smaller Stokes shift of 1926 (TBTT-i) and 2906 cm−1 (TBTT-o) vs. 4160 cm−1 (TBT, TPD flanked with two thiophene units) (Fig. S1†). In addition to the weak O–S intramolecular interactions,14 the additional short S–S contacts in TBTT-i can also contribute to its planar conformation. Compared with TBTT-o, the structural absorption and smaller Stokes shift of TBTT-i suggest that it has a more rigid conformation, which can be clearly deduced from the theoretical calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G** level. While TBTT-i is fully coplanar, TBTT-o shows a twisted structure with a dihedral angle of 14.8° (Fig. S2†).
Polymers with different thiophene orientations, P1, P2, and P3,15 were synthesized by a standard Pd-catalyzed Stille reaction and were purified by Soxhlet extraction with methanol, hexane, and either chloroform or chlorobenzene, successively. The key TBTTEH–2Br π-building blocks were synthesized according to our previously reported procedures.12 The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity (PDI) of P1–P3 are 7.93, 5.52, and 6.07 kDa, and 4.21, 3.98, and 3.77, respectively, which were estimated by gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) at 150 °C using 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the eluent.16 These polymers showed good solubility in o-dichlorobenzene (>10 mg mL−1) and excellent thermal stability (up to 390, 400, and 355 °C, respectively, at which 5 wt% loss was recorded, Fig. S6†). As indicated in Fig. 2 and S3,† compared with the reference polymer, PBDTTEH–TBTHD (P4: λabsmax: 596 nm), P1–P3 exhibited near-IR absorption (λabsmax: 726, 706, and 725 nm, respectively) with bathochromic shifts of over 100 nm, which indicates that the incorporation of the thiophene unit cannot alter the MBG nature of PBDT–TPD-polymers, and the LBG nature of P1–P3 is endowed by the quinoid-enhancing ability of TT.7a In contrast to P2, polymers P1 and P3 exhibited absorptions with obvious aggregation peaks, implying their more ordered packing in thin films. The optical bandgaps of P1–P3 were 1.54, 1.46, and 1.56 eV, respectively, which are significantly narrower than that of P4 (1.88 eV) by approximately 0.30 eV. The HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) energy levels of the polymers were determined to be −4.64 eV (P1), −4.63 eV (P2), and −4.78 eV (P3) by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) of polymer thin films on a silicon wafer (Fig. S5†).
 Fig. 2  UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of P1 (blue), P2 (green), P3 (red), and P4 (black) in thin films spun from o-dichlorobenzene solution. 
We first investigated the photovoltaic performances of P1 and P2 with conventional BHJ device configuration, ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymers:PC71BM/Ca/Al, which were tested under simulated 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G illumination; the results are summarized in Table 1. The active layer was formed by spin-coating with an o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) solution of polymer:PC71BM (1:1 weight ratio, 10 mg mL−1). As shown in Table 1, PCE values of up to 5.71% were obtained from the P1-based PSCs by thermal annealing of the blend films. Finally, 3% (v/v) 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was utilized as an additional processing additive, giving PCE values of 6.06 (P1) and 4.21% (P2). Further device optimization of P1 and P2 was undertaken with the inverted device geometry (ITO/ZnO/polymers:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag), which can provide better device stability due to the absence of a corrosive PEDOT:PSS hole transporting layer and low work function cathode. As shown in Fig. 3, the inverted devices gave promising PCEs of up to 6.70 (P1) and 4.45% (P2) with further improved Jsc values close to 17.77 and 15.21 mA cm2 respectively.17 High external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of P1 over 60% between a wide range of wavelengths (420–760 nm, with a peak value of 75% at 680 nm) were also recorded, with the responsive tail approaching approximately 850 nm, which is consistent with the absorption spectra. The high EQEs are consistent with large Jsc values (ca. 3% error). By contrast, the EQE responsive tail of the best MBG TPD polymers,3a PBDTTPDs, reach approximately 700 nm, leading to a lower Jsc of 12.6 mA cm−2. The enhanced Jsc of P1 can be unambiguously attributed to its intrinsic LBG nature.

The disparate device performance of P1 and P2 is a fascinating issue, and a detailed examination of the origins of this difference could further clarify the relationship between the molecular structure and the device performance. By analyzing in detail the device parameters of P1 and P2 reported in Table 1, we found that both polymers gave similar open-circuit voltage (Voc) values of approximately 0.6 V, which is consistent with their similar HOMO energy levels. However, although P2 can absorb slightly more light in the near-IR region than can P1, as indicated in Fig. 2, Jsc and fill factor (FF) values of P2 (15.21 mA cm−2, 48.58%) were inferior to those of P1 (17.77 mA cm−2, 63.13%). The carrier mobilities of both compounds in pristine films were examined by the field-effect transistor (FET) method. We found that P1 showed an excellent hole-transporting mobility of 0.15 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is higher than that of P2 (0.017 cm2 V−1 s−1) by nearly one order of magnitude (Fig. S12†), which might be correlated with the different degree of planarity of the TBTTs.18 Given that the pristine mobility does not always represent the carrier-transporting ability in blend active layers of OPV devices, we further examined the carrier mobilities of the blend films that were prepared under the same conditions used for the optimized devices by applying the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. The blend films of both polymers showed balanced hole and electron mobilities, 3.96 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (μh) and 1.28 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (μe) for P1 and 3.57 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 (μh) and 4.63 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 (μe) for P2. Thus, both measuring methods point to better semiconducting properties of P1 compared with those of P2. We consider that larger Jsc values of P1 may have resulted from more favorable charge transport. The morphology of the active layer19 is another key factor that can affect the device performance significantly. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements (Fig. S8†) revealed the amorphous nature of the polymer:PC71BM blends. The polymer:PC71BM blend films under the best device conditions were also investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. S9,†the P1:PC71BM blend film is much rougher than the P2:PC71BM blend film, giving a root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of 4.16 nm. Comparatively, the P2:PC71BM blend film only gives a RMS value of 1.43 nm. Also, the domains shown in the P1:PC71BM film are more distinct than those in the P2:PC71BM film, implying better phase separation. Similar differences are also observed in AFM phase images and TEM images for the two films. According to the above discussion, P1 and P2 with different orientations of fused thiophene units on the TBTT building blocks show significantly different photovoltaic performances, which may be related to varied semiconductivity and film morphology. This highlights the importance of incorporating specific structural regularity20 in the rational design of conjugated polymers, and also reveals the complexity of predicting the material performance.12
Given that the nature of the side alkyl chains plays a key role in the self-assembling properties of the polymer and the resulting device performance,3a,13 we evaluated the suitability of polymer P3, with a longer branched 2-hexyldecyl (HD) chain, in device construction. To our surprise, a higher PCE of 6.47% was obtained with the conventional device configuration. Even higher PCE values of up to 7.50% could be readily achieved with inverted device configuration without the use of additional post-treatment and/or additives.21 Compared with P2, polymer P3 comprehensively promoted all three parameters that determine the PCE, and the TEM images show a slight little phase separation scale (∼130 nm) than that of P1:PC71BM blends (∼150 nm), which may explain the larger Jsc and FF of P3:PC71BM blend films with easier charge separation and charge transport (Fig. S10†). More balanced hole and electron mobilities are also observed in the optimized P3:PC71BM blend film, 1.44 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (μh) and 1.79 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (μe). Given that P1–P3 are the first three examples of this series, we optimistically expect that TBTT-based LBG-polymers will be suitable for the development of high-performance solar cells by further optimizing the molecular system especially via lowering HOMO energy levels22 and device engineering.
So far, high-performance TPD polymers have an exclusively common structural feature that the TPD units are substituted with linear alkyl chains.7 McGehee et al. demonstrated that this structural feature was favorable for the close contact between the fullerene and TPD moiety of polymers.23 Thus, it is an exceptive example among TPD copolymers that P1–P3 with branched alkyl chains on TPDs can work well in PSCs. Upon closely inspecting the molecular structures of P1–P3, we deduce that 2D-expanded π-surfaces of TBTTs can reduce the negative effect of branched alkyl chains on TPD and, meanwhile, enhance the fullerene–TBTT contact. The geometry sizes of optimized TBTT structures (Fig. S1†) are approximately 10 Å in length and 7 Å in width, which is suitable for seating one PC71BM molecule. Accordingly, we found that the TBTT (acceptor) moieties of P1 showed 2D correlations with the pendant ester groups of PC61BM as deduced from the solid-state 2D 13C{1H} HETCOR NMR measurements of the P1:PC61BM blend.24
In summary, we have successfully developed TPD-type LBG-polymers combining two classical approaches to polymer design: D–A and quinoid strategies.25 This D–Q–A–Q arrangement endowed TPD polymers with low optical bandgaps and favorable charge-separation properties deriving from the enhanced quinoidal resonance and the short-distance contact between the fullerene and 2D TBTT respectively. The use of TPDs substituted with branched alkyl chains may enhance the solution processability of the polymers, but has no negative effect on the device performance. Low bandgaps do not always guarantee high Jsc, however, inverted PSC devices with P3:PC71BM blend films show promising Jsc of up to 18.2 mA cm−2 with PCE values of up to 7.50% without requiring additional device treatment or additives, which are among the best reported for LBG-polymers to date. We expect that LBG-polymers designed by inserting quinoid-enhancing moieties into D–A polymers will lead to high-performance single-junction or tandem solar cells.26
