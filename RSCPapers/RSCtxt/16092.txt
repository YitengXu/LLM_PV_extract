    , Accepted 5th December 2019First published on 5th December 2019AbstractHerein, we present a simple and novel approach to fabricate a bifunctional compatible electrode, which has functionalities of photoelectric conversion and energy storage. The integrated photo-assisted rechargeable battery of the two-electrode system demonstrates potential reduction and impressive performance enhancement with the assistance of illumination. Such a structure of a bifunctional compatible electrode provides more possibilities to develop more practical photo rechargeable battery.
Rechargeable batteries as the power source of portable and smart devices for sensing, communication, and other autonomous devices are severely restrained because of unsustainable power supply.1,2 To meet the power requirement, some early attempts have tried to combine solar cells with rechargeable batteries.3,4 Recently, it has been shown that two separate devices can be connected directly by an external circuit, leading to additional undesirable questions such as ohmic loss, expanded device volume, and stacked solar cell design for charging commercial batteries. In response, an integration device by incorporating solar cells5,6 and energy storing devices7–9 into one house has been developed very recently as a strategy for the self-charging of energy storage devices.10–14 The integrated device for the simultaneous conversion and storage of solar energy through sharing electrode15–17 and electrolyte shows less cost, portable volume, and small ohmic loss.18,19
Although the first concept of photocharging device was proposed by Hodes et al. in 1976,20 substantial progress has been achieved very recently. In 2013, Gui et al. described a solar rechargeable sodium ion battery based on microspherical Fe2(MoO4)3 anode materials, which can be charged to 0.6 V under light in several seconds.21 In 2017, Lei et al. combined an AB5-type hydrogen storage alloy with a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) to fabricate a hydrogen storage mechanism for solar rechargeable battery.22 In 2018, Li et al. presented a monolithically integrated solar flow battery with a high photo-voltage tandem III–V photo-electrode that presented an overall efficiency of 14.1%.23 Nevertheless, the insufficient voltage provided by the solar cell failed to achieve the full charging potential, thus confining further development of photo rechargeable batteries.
In this regard, photo-assisted charging for compensating insufficient charging voltage would ensure the suitable function of a rechargeable battery. In 2015, Yu et al. first demonstrated an aqueous lithium–iodine flow battery combined with photo-assisted charging to decrease the charging voltage and save up to 20% energy.24 Since then, a series of attempts based on photocatalysts of the photo-electrode have achieved photo-assisted charging for various types of redox flow cells and have shown impressive performance.25–27 In 2017, Zaghib et al. reported a novel two-electrode photo-assisted rechargeable LIB that enabled the delithiation of LiFePO4 nanocrystals with the help of holes to form FePO4.28 In 2018, Lv et al. realized conversion and storage from solar energy to electrochemical energy in a covalent organic framework.29
To further optimize the device, combining the function of photoelectrical conversion and energy storage into one integrated electrode (bifunctional electrode) that can be employed in a two-electrode system has been developed, which avoids complex device structure for increasing the stability under the working conditions. Nevertheless, the unsatisfactory charge and discharge efficiency restrains the further development of the two-electrode device. In fact, the reported photo-assisted rechargeable battery based on a two-electrode device is still far from its ideal performance due to the unsatisfactory charge and discharge behavior of the rechargeable part of the battery, which is due to the mismatch of the bifunctional electrode in the whole system and poor contact between the electrodes. Hence, we focused on seeking a stable and compatible material to constitute the bifunctional electrode and to design a simple, high efficiency device structure. In previous reports, Cu2S has been widely used as a counter electrode of quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs)30–32 because of its high catalytic activity and stability in the polysulfide redox system.33–35 In addition, Cu2S as a cathode material of LIBs reveals high capacity and good electronic conductivity.36,37 In the present study, bifunctional Cu2S was chosen as a sharing electrode to construct the two-electrode photo-assisted rechargeable battery, which avoids the tedious switch and improves the compatibility.10,28,38
In this study, for the first time, the Cu2S counter electrode was directly deposited on the N719 sensitized TiO2 photoanode to form a bifunctional compatible electrode, which simultaneously allowed the lithiation and delithiation of Li ions and harvesting of light for generating dye+ molecules and electrons, thus integrating photoelectric conversion and energy storage into one electrode. Furthermore, for this novel device, the electrolyte is discarded, which is necessary in QDSSCs and DSSCs, for reducing the path of electron transmission and avoiding the incompatibility between different electrolytes. To evaluate the photoelectric property of this bifunctional compatible electrode, we tested the light response of different electrodes and confirmed the feasibility. Clearly, Cu2S as a sharing electrode reveals admirable capacity, stability, and compatibility in the integrated system. Unlike previous devices where the photo-electrodes are soaked into the electrolyte directly, a compact device of a sandwich structure assembled here benefits wetting between the electrolyte and the active material (Cu2S), thus improving the device performance. For our two-electrode photo-assisted rechargeable battery, the charge potential of the integrated device is reduced to 0.2 V during charging under illumination. Simultaneously, the charging capacity is increased about two times with the help of solar illumination. When the device is illuminated in the discharging process, the discharging capacity is promoted enormously and steadily. This study indicates that the mechanism of electron generation, transfer, and storage in the novel device structure holds a great promise for potential applications such as in practical photo rechargeable batteries.
The schematic configuration and photo-assisted charging progress of the integrated device are shown in Fig. 1. The structure of the integrated battery with the two-electrode configuration is described in Fig. 1a, which contains a TiO2/dye (CdS QDs)/Cu2S (CuxS) photoelectrode, LiTFSI electrolyte, and a metallic Li electrode. A battery with sandwich construction was assembled by packaging tape. Before the performance test, the integrated battery was put in direct contact by mechanical pressing and placed in dark for 7 h. The bifunctional Cu2S was chosen as a sharing electrode to construct the two-electrode photo-assisted rechargeable battery. The discharge process of the battery at the first cycle in dark can be expressed as follows: Cu2S + 2Li+ + 2e− → Li2S + 2Cu(1)
 Fig. 1  (a) Two-electrode photo-assisted charging configuration and (b) photo-assisted charging progress of the integrated battery. 
After the first cycle, the following cycles can be shown as: Li2S + 2Cu ⇄ Cu1.96S + 0.04Cu + 2Li+ + 2e−(2)
For the present photo-assisted rechargeable battery, after the reduction reaction of the first discharging process in dark, the light will participate in the reactions of the following cycles, as shown in Fig. 1b. Once illuminated, the dye molecule is excited to dye* and then injects e− to TiO2. The generated electrons are transferred to the external circuit through the interface between TiO2 and FTO, which combines with Li+ to form Li on the surface of lithium metal. Simultaneously, dye+ as the product after electron injection helps in the oxidation reaction of Cu/Li2S to Cu1.96S/Li+ directly.24 Compared with the oxidation reaction between the photoanode and electrolyte of a typical sensitized solar cell, the oxidation reaction between the photoanode and Cu2S will be more efficient and stable. The reaction processes of the bifunctional compatible electrode are shown as follows: dye + hν → dye*(3) dye* + TiO2 → TiO2|dye+ + TiO2|e−(4) 2dye+ + Li2S + 2Cu → 2dye + Cu1.96S + 0.04Cu + 2Li+(5)
And the reaction process of the other electrode can be written as given below: Li+ + e− → Li(6)
The detailed microstructure of the bifunctional compatible electrode was investigated via SEM and TEM, as shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2a and b are the cross-sectional view of the bifunctional compatible electrode. The thicknesses of the dye-sensitized mesoporous TiO2 film (bottom layer) and Cu2S film (top layer) is 8 and 12 μm, respectively. The interface between TiO2 and Cu2S could be clearly confirmed. The as-prepared Cu2S exhibits a typical flower-like morphology, which can be observed from the top view of electrode in Fig. 2c and d. The flower-like Cu2S nanoparticles with ∼1.5 μm diameter are composed of several nanosheet petals, and this result is consistent with the previous report.39 The flower-like structure would be helpful for the lithiation and delithiation processes owing to the electroactive surface sites and large specific surface area.40 The TEM image in Fig. 2e indicates obvious flower-like nanoparticles. The EDX mapping images of Cu2S nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 2f and g. The elements Cu and S are distributed homogeneously on the detected area. The nanosheet petals could be clearly observed from the elemental distribution and the results indicate the assembly of the flower-like Cu2S. The XRD patterns of the composite electrode in Fig. S1† give further evidence for the preparation of the desired structure. For TiO2, the diffraction peaks located at 2θ values of 25.4°, 37.9°, 48.1°, 53.9°, and 55.3° correspond to (101), (004), (200), (105), and (211) of the anatase phase. For Cu2S, the diffraction peaks located at 2θ values of 37.47°, 46.21°, 48.80°, and 54.81° correspond to the (102), (110), (103), and (004) crystal lattice structure of the Cu2S phase.

In the general sense, the construction of DSSCs or QDSSCs should include the photoanode, electrolyte, and counter electrode. Cu2S shows relatively high catalytic activity and matches well with the polysulfide electrolyte, thus becoming the most popular choice of counter electrode for QDSSCs.35 However, it is barely used in DSSCs due to the effect of corrosion caused by the electrolyte containing iodine. In addition, Cu2S is a promising cathode material for rechargeable batteries owing to its high capacity and good electronic conductivity in the copper sulfide family.41 Based on the above consideration, we first designed a novel device structure and abandoned the electrolyte that is necessary in DSSCs or QDSSCs. Cu2S that served as a counter electrode in DSSCs or QDSSCs is directly deposited on the dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanode in order to integrate both photoelectric conversion and energy storage into one electrode.
To elaborate the function of different layers, we measured the I–V curves of bare TiO2, TiO2/dye, and TiO2/dye/Cu2S films as photoanodes in traditional DSSC configuration with electrolyte filling, as shown in Fig. 3a. Fig. 3b exhibits the performances of the three photoelectrodes. When bare TiO2 is used as the photoanode, the PCE is extremely low due to the limited absorption of sunlight owing to the wide bandgap of TiO2. The dye-sensitized TiO2 photoelectrode shows much better efficiency that approaches 5% owing to the strong light absorption of organic dyes and efficient electron extraction from the dye to TiO2. When TiO2/dye/Cu2S serves as the photoanode, again very low PCE is observed, which is slightly higher than that of the bare TiO2 photoanode. The low performance is attributed to the existence of the Cu2S layer between the dye and the electrolyte, which hinders direct contact between the dye and the electrolyte; thus, dye* could not be reduced effectively. In addition, the I3−/I− electrolyte in DSSCs could induce serious corrosion of Cu2S, thus resulting in poor cycle stability. Fig. 3d is the I–V curve of TiO2/dye/Cu2S, which is measured under the deficiency of electrolyte, and Cu2S and TiO2 are connected with external electrodes directly, as shown in Fig. 3c. There is no photovoltaic conversion behavior presented. Inversely, a typical Ohmic contact is confirmed and the composite electrode shows a state of short circuit. As a matter of fact, it also called “short-circuit electrode” here for the novel and specially designed electrode. The specially designed bifunctional compatible electrode provides us the opportunity to develop novel photo-assisted rechargeable batteries.

Photo-response is the most important phenomenon of a photo-assisted rechargeable battery, and the present device shows an obvious signal of photo-assisted charging. The charge voltage of the battery decreases immediately upon illumination and increases again when the light is turned off, as shown in Fig. 4a. To seek a more compatible electrode, we measured the photo-response of the photo-assisted rechargeable battery fabricated with three different composite electrodes: TiO2/dye/Cu2S, TiO2/CdS QD/CuxS, and TiO2/CdS QD/Cu2S. Clearly, all the three devices showed a drop in the charging voltage upon illumination, which is followed by slow recovery in the charging voltage in the dark. For the TiO2/dye/Cu2S electrode, the open circuit potential of the integrated battery is 3.15 V in dark and it exhibits a quickly drop to 2.8 V upon illumination. The potential of the battery is decided by the potential difference of the two electrodes (cuprous sulfide and lithium metal). The photogenerated electrons rapidly accumulate in the photoelectrode, inducing a voltage drop,42 and the consumption of accumulated electrons in the dark results in the recovery of the charging voltage. The retardant recovery time of voltage in the dark is because the Cu2S layer limits the electrons scavenging process by the redox species.

The integrated battery based on the TiO2/dye/Cu2S short-circuit electrode achieves the highest PCE and dramatic variation in the charging voltage over the two CdS-sensitized electrodes shows outstanding compatibility. In the present study, CdS QD sensitizers are deposited on the TiO2 film by SILAR method without further coating with a ZnS passivation layer, and the surface trap for electrons and photobleaching of CdS QDs maybe the main reason for low cell performance. In particular, the TiO2/CdS QD/CuxS short-circuit electrode exhibits negligible photoresponse upon illumination, which could be attributed to the SILAR method for depositing CuxS. Due to the mesoporous structure of TiO2/CdS, it is difficult to form a dense and continuous film by further deposition of CuxS by the SILAR method, thus inducing the invasion of electrolyte. The attempt to coat the TiO2/dye film with CuxS would induce the desorption of dye from TiO2 in the aqueous solution. In general, the principle of material choice for photoresponse should be focused on the photoelectric conversion capacity of sensitizers and the compatibility of different parts in the integrated system.
Based on the obvious photo-response of our integrated device, we measure the galvanostatic charge and discharge curves with intermittent illumination, which show the corresponding phenomenon of voltage variation. Fig. 4b shows that when the device is charged to 3 V with illumination, the voltage ascends to 3.2 V quickly and then starts to discharge when the light source is closed. A 0.2 V increase in the voltage could be observed when the circumstances change from illumination to dark in the charge process, which is similar to the change in the open circuit potential from illumination to dark in Fig. 4a. This phenomenon was previously observed for liquid-junction solar redox flow batteries.24,27 The 0.2 V decrease in the charge voltage results in energy saving of 6.25%, which is first realized in the lithium ion battery-based photo-assisted system. The charge time from 1.6 V to 3 V with illumination gradually increases with increasing cycles, which accounts for the short-circuit electrode becoming less sensitive to light.
For the integrated device, Fig. S2† shows the initial five CV cycles measured at a scan rate of 0.5 mV s−1. The voltage window is different from that of a previous work because it determines the prevention of the reduction reaction of SnO2 to Sn.43 Unlike later cycles, the first cathodic scan shows a weak reduction peak at 2.0 V, which probably results from the formation of the SEI membrane. For the anodic scan, the strong oxidation peak at 2.1 V is due to the formation of Cu2S. Before performance measurement of the integrated device, we tested the charge and discharge curves of a typical lithium ion battery structure (FTO/Cu2S/LiTFSI electrolyte/metallic Li), which is based on the SnO2:F current collector (without dye sensitized TiO2), as shown in Fig. S3† for reference. The present FTO/Cu2S electrode shows the first discharge capacity of 170 mA h g−1, corresponding to 50.45% of its theoretical capacity (337 mA h g−1) at 0.15 C (1 C = 337 mA g−1).41 At 0.3 C, the discharge capacity of the battery declines to 100 mA h g−1. The cycling performances of different current densities of lithium ion battery are shown in Fig. S4.†

Fig. 5a shows the typical galvanostatic charge–discharge curves with different conditions of intermittent illumination at 0.3 C distinctly. The blue and yellow shaded areas represent the dark and light circumstances during charging or discharging. The top diagram shows curves without photo-assisted charging (PC) and without photo-assisted discharging (PD) in the dark, which is similar to the typical rechargeable battery based on our integrated device in dark at 0.3 C. For the middle diagram, the performance is researched by PC but without PD based on the same device. The curve for without PC but PD is shown in the bottom diagram. Compared to the curve without illumination, both PC and PD prolong the reaction time clearly, which illustrates the positive effect of illumination during the reaction of the integrated device. In consideration of the inability of the light source (Xe lamp) to work long hours, the galvanostatic charge and discharge with illumination measurement is not implemented. The following measurements proceed on the basis of these three ways based on the integrated device.

(b) Discharge curves with and without illumination for the first cycle. (c) Galvanostatic charge (without illumination)-discharge (with illumination) curves for 10 cycles. (d) Cycling stability measurements with and without intermittent illumination for 20 cycles. 
The discharge capacities of the first cycles are shown in Fig. 5b. For the black line (without PC and without PD), the discharge capacity is only 5.6 mA h g−1 for the integrated device. The embedded diagram is the prototype device, which is discharged by loading a yellow light-emitting-diode indicator (working voltage: 1.7–1.8 V) in dark. To investigate the effect of illumination on the capacity, the discharge capacity curve (red line) is tested, which increases to 16 mA h g−1 with PC and without PD. The enhancement of the capacity illustrates that illumination stimulates the reaction corresponding to eqn (5). However, the discharge capacity is still not ideal due to the limited quantity of Li2S and Cu corresponding to eqn (1) after the first discharge process. Furthermore, the capacity of the blue line (without PC and with PD) reaches an impressive value of 209.6 mA h g−1, which is much higher than that of the former. The discharge capacity under illumination is much higher because of the photo-assisted discharge effect, which is confirmed by numerous intermittent charge processes when testing the battery. The supplemented electrons by photo-generation would prolong the discharge time for increasing the discharge capacity. The adverse effect of the photo-generated dye+ will induce the oxidation reaction of Cu/Li2S translating to Cu1.96S/Li+. So, the illumination will participate in the redox reaction effectively, which results in capacity enhancement.
To further research the photo-assisted effect, we measured the charge and discharge capacity curves for 10 cycles. For the photo-assisted discharge process, as shown in Fig. 5c, the charge capacity is only 5.6 mA h g−1 for the first cycle. However, the discharge capacity reaches an impressive value of 209.6 mA h g−1, with the assistance of illumination for discharging, which is because the photo-assisted discharge process at the first cycle is the photoactivation process of the device. After the first cycle, the discharge capacity decreases to about 150 mA h g−1 and the obvious discharge platform with illumination at 1.65 V corresponds to the platform of discharge curves without illumination in Fig. S5.† For the photo-assisted charge process (Fig. S5†), the discharge capacity decreases from 16 mA h g−1 (1st) to 6 mA h g−1 (10th) gradually in ten cycles under photo-assisted charge, attributing to the bifunctional compatible electrode becoming less sensitive to light and high current density. The gradually increased charge capacity with cycling may be because illumination in the discharge process could prejudice the subsequent oxidation reaction in dark.
The cycling stabilities of the batteries with or without intermittent illumination are compared in Fig. 5d. After the photo-assisted charge, the discharge capacity is much higher than charge without illumination. The significant difference suggests that more Cu1.96S/Li+ formed with the assistance of illumination for significantly enhancing the discharge capacity during cycling. Furthermore, the discharge capacity of the photo-assisted rechargeable battery under the photo-assisted discharge remained at 130 mA h g−1 after 10 cycles and 65 mA h g−1 after 20 cycles at 0.3 C, which is much higher than the device without the photo-assisted discharge, which is attributed to the photo-induced electron and the excellent capacity retention of the bifunctional compatible electrode. However, the discharge capacity decreased obviously after 10 cycles owing to the poor photo-assisted effect, which is caused by long time illumination and cycling. Fig. 6 is the SEM images of the composite electrode after cycling with intermittent illumination. The obvious flower-like structures are maintained, which illustrates the compatibility and stability of Cu2S. The flower-like structure of Cu2S with 1.5 μm diameter could be clearly observed. The lamellar structure thickness of the Cu2S nanoflower is about 20 nm. The flower-like morphology provides enough surface area for wetting by the electrolyte. In addition, the as-prepared Cu2S particles illustrating the nanosheet-assembly of hydrothermal method are suited to dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanode and the LiTFSI electrolyte. This method of the as-prepared materials will provide a new way to build a bifunctional electrode. Furthermore, the adaptive ability of the device towards illumination can provide more possibilities for practical applications.
 Fig. 6  (a) and (b) are the top view SEM images of the composite electrode after cycling with intermittent illumination. 
In general, while the innovation and feasibility of the present photo-assisted rechargeable battery has been reported, it is still far away from satisfactory performance for practical applications. As a matter of fact, some subsistent factors of the present photo-assisted rechargeable battery could affect the performance as follows: (1) the electrical conductivity of the bifunctional compatible electrode; (2) the photoelectric conversion efficiency; (3) the stability of the integrated device. For our bifunctional compatible electrode, the electrical conductivity of the FTO film as a current collector is lower than that of copper or aluminum foil used in a traditional battery. The photogenerated electron experiences a longer transfer path through a mesoporous TiO2 layer before arriving at the Li electrode compared with the traditional battery, thus inducing partial loss of the electron. In addition, the ability of photoelectric conversion of the sensitizers as a key factor determines the overall efficiency of the integrated device.44 The charge recombination, which affects the photoelectric conversion efficiency deeply, further limits the reaction between dye+ and Cu2S under illumination. For actual application, the above-mentioned factors should be carefully investigated in future work.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we fabricated a facile and novel bifunctional TiO2/dye/Cu2S compatible electrode, and demonstrated a photo-assisted rechargeable battery of the two-electrode system, which allowed solar energy conversion and storage simultaneously. Once illuminated, the dye+ helps the oxidation reaction during the process of charging and discharging. For the photo-assisted charging, the charge voltage was reduced by 0.2 V and the bifunctional electrode improved the charge capacity. For the photo-assisted discharging, the discharge capacity was improved from 6 mA h g−1 to 209 mA h g−1 and remained at 150 mA h g−1 after 10 cycles. The present structure of the bifunctional compatible electrode paves the way for exploring more efficient and stable photo rechargeable batteries.
