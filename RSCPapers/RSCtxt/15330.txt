Recently, low band gap organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials have shown an unprecedented ∼8% efficiency in solar cell devices. Although the energetic alignment is crucial in the optimization of these materials, the structural and kinetic effects are also important factors in the overall device performance.

1. Introduction
Since the discovery of photoconducting polymers,1,2 there has been an increasing interest in improving, understanding, and modifying the building blocks of these structures to make more efficient, low cost, durable materials for various applications.3–13 Photoconducting polymers can be used in devices such as organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs)14 and organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells.15 In particular, low band gap polymers are currently extensively explored for OPV cells due to their relevance to renewable energy sources in this era of rising world energy consumption. Inexpensive “roll to roll” (R2R) methods are currently being employed as a means to make OPV production competitive costwise compared to the production of more conventional solar cell materials such as silicon.11,16 Although many OPV polymer materials have been studied, derivatives of polythiophene, such as poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), are commonly used as the electron donor, while the electron acceptor is typically a molecule such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). In spite of their intense absorption in the visible region, P3HT derivatives are still not energetically optimized for light harvesting from the solar spectrum, especially in the near IR region. Therefore, much effort has been put into lowering the band gap of photoconducting polymers by chemical modification, such as synthesizing copolymers with alternating electron rich and electron deficient units.17 A series of low band gap polymers synthesized by Yongye Liang and Luping Yu at the University of Chicago are such examples.6,9,18–23 These polymers have various ring structures throughout the chain, but a common electron withdrawing thieno[3,4-b] thiophene unit is also incorporated into the backbone chain of all polymers in this work. The low band gap poly-thienothiophene-benzodithiophene (PTB) polymers have essentially the same sequence of alternating thieno[3,4-b] thiophene (TT) and benzodithiophene (BDT) monomer units attached with different side groups. Over ten PTBpolymers have been reported up to date and differ by their aliphatic pendant side chains and presence of fluorine on the TT unit. The PTBpolymers, when used as electron donor materials in the bulk heterojunction solar cells, truly stand out as one of the most highly efficient polymer systems in production today. In this report, the PTBpolymers, particularly PTB1 and PTB7, are compared to another low band gap polymer, PF, with very similar energetic properties. Although harvesting more photons from the sun may enhance the device efficiency, other factors, such as the morphology and charge separation dynamics in the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) films, also affect the overall device power conversion efficiency (PCE). We present detailed studies of PTB and PFpolymer structures and properties using grazing incidence X-ray scattering (GIXS) and ultrafast transient absorption methods. We will highlight the advantages and drawbacks of polymer materials in present studies and compare them to the benchmark polymer, P3HT, that has been studied extensively in the past decades. We will also demonstrate three key optimization factors for the OPV device efficiency to benefit from the low band gaps in the photoconduction polymers: (1) the energy levels of the HOMO and LUMO in the polymers, (2) the morphology differences in neat and bulk heterojunction (BHJ) films and (3) the kinetics of charge transfer and charge transport in these films. It should be noted that this highlight focuses on the initial physical and photophysical properties in active conductive polymers important for solar cell optimization. For further details on the considerations of solar cell processing in devices and the complex issues regarding optimization of device processing such as R2R methods and polymer stability, the reader is directed to several other works which deal with these issues in more detail.16,24–28
2. Band gap energies and band level alignment in OPV devices
In general, OPV devices are comprised of five layers: (1) an indium tin oxide (ITO) anode, (2) a hole collecting layer such as PEDOT:PSS, (3) an active layer that typically comprises a blended film of a polymer donor material and a fullerene acceptor material, (4) a cathode interfacial layer such as LiF, and (5) an Al cathode.29 Although the energetic levels of all of these layers are important in the overall device efficiency, we will mainly focus here on the energetic differences of the active layer. A schematic of the HOMO and LUMO levels of the electron donor and acceptor materials is shown in Fig. 1.15 Two important parameters in Fig. 1 are intimately connected to the overall device efficiency: (1) the energy difference between the HOMO level of the donor and the LUMO level of the acceptor and (2) the energetic overlap with the solar spectrum. In addition, the relative positions of the LUMO levels of both the donor and the acceptor moieties will determine the driving force of the charge separation and therefore the overall device performance. Therefore, a delicate balance is present between the low band gap of the material and the driving force for the charge separation in order to reach an optimal open circuit voltage VOC, and hence the optimal efficiency in the OPV device.30

The structures of four polymers, P3HT, PF, PTB7, and PTTD, along with their corresponding absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 2. P3HT is often used as a benchmark material to which novel polymer materials are compared. The three low band gap polymers, PF, PTB7, and PTTD, all have a common thieno[3,4-b] thiophene (TT) unit incorporated into the polymer backbone. Poly-TT has been synthesized and has a band gap as low as 0.85 V, which is too low for any effective charge transfer in typical bulk heterojunction (BHJ) devices because its LUMO level lies far below the LUMO level of PCBM. Therefore, the TT unit was connected sequentially with (a) different stoichiometry ratios of thiophene (T) units, or (b) benzodithiophene (BDT) units to slightly increase the band gap for OPV applications. The three low band gap polymers were also fluorinated to further lower the HOMO position and therefore increase the open circuit voltage of the polymer materials.

Polymer optical band gaps are typically determined by taking the tangent crossing of the low energy side of the electronic absorption spectrum. The band gap of P3HT is 1.9 eV.31 The integrated photon flux using this band gap is 42% (Fig. 2, top).8 In contrast, PTTD has a band gap of 1.2 eV with an integrated photon flux of 80%.19,22 The band gap of both PF and PTB7 is ∼1.6 eV, which corresponds to an integrated photon flux of 58%.11,12 The corresponding solar cell parameters, including the cell efficiencies, are shown in Table 1. PTB7 shows the highest solar cell efficiency while PTTD exhibits the poorest device parameters. The theoretical solar cell efficiency maxima with respect to both the donor band gap and the donor LUMO energy levels are shown in Fig. 3, which was adapted from previous reports.32 Using this relationship, the optimal band gap for the device efficiency is 1.5 eV. The energetic alignment and the corresponding theoretical efficiencies for the polymers P3HT,33PF,18PTB7,9PTB1,21 and PTTD19 are also depicted in this figure. PTTD has the lowest energetic band gap at 1.2 eV, but its LUMO level is only 0.2 eV above that of the PCBM, which provides an insufficient driving force for the exciton splitting into an electron–hole pair.30 The resulting power conversion efficiency results in a device power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.73%. The highest theoretical PCE based on the band gap and the relative band level alignment of the donor and acceptor materials is roughly 8–10% for the PF and various PTBpolymers. However, the maximum PCE obtained for solar cell devices fabricated with the PF:PC6060BMBHJ films is only 2.4%.18 In contrast, the maximum PCE recorded for PTB7:PC71BM is over 7.4%.9 The open circuit voltage (VOC) for PF BHJ solar cells is 0.59 V while the open circuit voltage for PTB7 BHJ devices is 0.76 V. This accounts for an overall ∼30% increase in the device PCE for the PTB BHJ devices. Once again, PTB7 differs from PTB1 only in the pendant aliphatic chains and the addition of a fluorine atom on the TT units. The structures of PTB1 and PTB7 are shown in Fig. 3b. It has been reported previously that PTB1 devices have a VOC of 0.58 V and PCE of 4.8% when using PC6161BM as the acceptor material.21 When comparing the energetics of the PTB1 and PFpolymers, the band level alignments of the HOMO and LUMO levels are nearly identical. Nevertheless, the PTB1 based solar cells show a 200% increase in the device PCE compared to that of the PF devices. The use of PC7171BM has also increased the PCE of devices made from many low band gap polymers, including PTB1 and PTB7.9,21 So far, the highest PCE reported for the PTBpolymer photovoltaics is from the device using PC7171BM as the acceptor material. Previous studies on the PTB series have shown that PC7171BM increases the overall PCE by 15–20%.21 Considering the increase in the open circuit voltage and the enhanced performance due to the use of PC7171BM in the PTB7 devices, the PTB7 device should show a 50% increase in the solar cell efficiency assuming both cells are optimized. In reality, the PTB7 devices show a 300% increase in the overall efficiency compared to the PF devices. Furthermore, the hole mobility of the PTB neat polymers shows a two to three fold increase over the neat PFpolymers, which indicates that the transport properties of these materials are also favorable. The overall comparison of both PTB1 and PTB7 to PF suggests that other factors of the active layer besides the energetics, such as morphology and charge transport, also cause the efficiencies of the PTBpolymer devices to increase by about a factor of two compared to the PF devices.

The P3HT and PF film absorption spectra (Fig. 2) display sizable red shifts compared to the solution spectra. In contrast, only slight differences are shown between the solution and thin film spectra for PTB7 and PTTD. The red shifts in the P3HT and PF film spectra are attributed to the planarization of the polymer backbone chain, resulting in a longer conjugation length of the polymer chain in films.18,34 In solution, the adjacent thiophene rings along the polymer backbone are more likely to twist relative to each other, causing a more twisted polymer backbone with a shorter conjugation length. In contrast, the PTB and PTTDpolymers have more fused rings along the backbone chain, which increases the quinoidal character of these species. Therefore, there is an increase in the electron density or the effective bond order on the C–C bonds connecting the aromatic rings, which adds constraints of the twists between the adjacent aromatic rings, and hence flattens the molecules. Compared to the already rather planar chain conformation in solution, very little further flattening of the polymer chains upon the film formation occurs, and thus very little red shift in the absorption spectra of the PTB and PTTD films is observed compared to those of the solutions. Future works will also probe the effects of aggregates in solution of the PTBpolymers.
3. Morphology differences in PF and the PTB series polymers
Using the grazing incidence X-ray scattering (GIXS) techniques, the polymer and BHJ film morphology can be investigated on different spatial scales, from molecular packing to the domain sizes and arrangements. The GIXS images for the pristine PF and PTB1 films are shown in Fig. 418,35 and provide the scattering profiles for PF in the q = 0.14–1.0 Å−1 region (Fig. 4a) and the PTB1 in the q = 0.15–1.9 Å−1 region (Fig. 4b), respectively. The domain spacing was obtained by the relationship d = 2π/q. The PF film structure has a morphology similar to that of P3HT films, which have been studied in great detail by various groups.36–42 The ring-like structures at q = 0.39 Å−1 are attributed to the interatomic d-spacing (100) in the films. This spacing is determined by the width of the polymer with extended alkyl side chains on the individual thiophene units.43,44 An enhancement of the scattering peak in the z direction is observed, which indicates that the alkyl chains attached onto the polymer backbones tend to orient perpendicular to the sample surface. Although it is not shown, the polymer backbone π–π stacking peak at q ≈ 1.7 Å−1 has also been observed in the y direction, which further indicates that the polymer backbone chain lies perpendicular to the sample surface. This morphology is typical of a polythiophene polymer material with a low molecular weight and high regioregularity. The higher order peaks are observed in PF films, but they are less distinct than those observed in P3HT. This could be due to possible irregularities introduced by the central TT unit on the PF backbone chain. This moiety can be considered as a regular quasi-defect site within the backbone chain of the material.43 The spacing of the alkyl chain is not uniform in this region, which will hinder film uniformity. It is also important to note that the overall efficiency of PF was recorded as 2.38%. The efficiency of P3HT, when fabricated under similar conditions, was actually lower (∼1.4%).18 Over the past several decades, extensive studies on P3HT have increased the overall efficiency in solar cell device from less than 0.01% initially45 to over 6%.46,47 Compared to this benchmark material, the low band gap polymers currently under investigation are still in their infancy. Many of the improvements in the P3HT devices have been made in improving the morphology of the films. Since PF is structurally similar to P3HT, the similar improvements would likely enhance the solar cell performance of these materials, but the presence of this quasi-defect state could lead to a slightly different optimized morphology for the PF OPV devices.
 Fig. 4  The GIWAXS images for (a) PF and (b) PTB1. Adapted from ref. 18 and 35, respectively. 
The GIXS images for PTB1 (Fig. 4b) are remarkably different from the images obtained for PF. The most striking feature is the anisotropic peak at q = 1.71 Å−1 in the z direction (Fig. 4b). This peak is attributed to the π–π stacking feature, which indicates that the polymer backbone chain lies parallel to the sample surface. This orientation is more favorable for OPV device performance. It has been shown previously that the hole transport in polymer devices is dominated by the inter-chain π–π interactions of the polymer backbone chain.44 The relative increase in the hole mobility of the PTBpolymers (as shown in Table 1) is partially attributed to this favorable orientation. In polymers such as P3HT or PF, the hole has to travel both intra-chain (through the backbone) and inter-chain (through the π–π interaction) pathways. In the PTBpolymers, the hole travels predominantly through the inter-chain pathways because the π–π stacking is perpendicular to the electrode surface, so the polymer is aligned to exhibit the shortest inter-chain pathways for the hole transport. Moreover, the conjugated polymer backbone plane in this packing morphology would have an optimal interaction with the collecting anode material, hence maximizing the charge transport across the active layer and surface layer interface. There is also a peak observed at q = 0.23 Å−1, which is attributed to the (100) d-spacing of the polymer material. No higher order peaks are observed for this domain, which also contrasts the results obtained for the PFpolymer. This finding indicates that the PTB films are less ordered. The (100) d-spacing is also much larger for the PTBpolymers compared to PF or P3HT even though the alkyl side chains are similar in length, indicating that the PTB side chains do not intertwine in the films.
There have been many extensive and dedicated studies devoted to determining the optimal morphology of P3HT:PCBM films for OPV devices.48,49 For these composite materials, it has been determined that the optimal film morphology will have the donor and acceptor domain sizes of ∼10–20 nm that are connected by strands of amorphous polymer and fullerene materials.50 Because the crystallinity for the PTB:PCBM films is much lower, the domain sizes are smaller and the donor:acceptor interface area is larger, the excitons do not need to travel far to the sites of the charge separation. However, the question still remains why a smaller domain size would be favorable in PTBpolymers while other polymers must maintain some crystallinity for optimal device performance. The perpendicular polymer backbone π–π stacking orientation to the electrode surface for the PTBpolymers could explain this discrepancy. Since the additional hole pathways can be established in a shortest pathway through the π–π stacks mentioned above in the PTB:PCBM films, the holes do not have to travel along a planar polymer backbone that is only enforced by a long range order in large crystalline domains. Hence, the crystallinity is not as crucial in the PTB films. The PTB films also have a higher probability to form smaller interpenetrating networks in the blended films, which would further enhance the separation and transport mechanisms in the film materials. In future works, we will also investigate the nature of the electron diffusion in a copolymer material such as the PTBpolymersvs. homocyclic polymers like P3HT.
Although very large differences were observed in PTB1 and PF, there can also be large discrepancies in the device PCE due to very small morphological differences. Recently, we have investigated morphological differences in the seven PTBpolymers reported to date with the emphasis on the π–π stacking region.51 These polymers have also been incorporated into OPV devices using two different acceptor materials, namely PC6161BM and PC7171BM, and in the presence or absence of an additive, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), in the spin casting solutions. The different kinds of PTBpolymers synthesized and characterized, along with their device parameters, are shown in Table 2. From the results obtained here, we can see that there is a large range of PCE within the PTB series. The scattering profiles that represent the π–π stacking distance for the seven PTBpolymers are shown in Fig. 5. We have discovered that the π–π stacking distance is determined almost entirely on the alkyl chain on the BDT unit while the efficiency dependence is determined mainly by the alkyl chain on the TT unit. The effects of fluorination of the TT units were also observed and will be discussed in future works. Even the polymer with the lowest efficiency, PTB6, which has a large branched group on the TT moiety, shows π–π stacking interaction and hence has some crystallinity in the material. Therefore, there is a delicate interplay of the morphological optimization of these materials. It is interesting to note that the PTBpolymers have already achieved efficiencies very close to their theoretical maximum without much optimization of the production parameters. It has been shown that by using PC7171BM and by adding a small amount of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) to the casting solution will further increase the overall device PCE. If the solar cell devices do not need to undergo costly annealing procedures in order to maximize the overall efficiency, then the cost of production is greatly reduced, which makes the PTBpolymers even more attractive for solar cell devices.

The GIXS images in the region q ≈ 0.01–0.15 Å−1 were also investigated in order to reveal the long-range domain order in the BHJ films. The horizontal line profiles of the scattering images of the PF and PF:PCBM samples are shown in Fig. 6a while the scattering profiles of PTB3, PTB6, and P3HT are shown in Fig. 6b. The pristine films for both PF and PTB1 show a linear relationship in logarithm of the scattering intensity vs. logarithm of the q factor, indicating the absence of distinct domains in this region. The d-spacing of 6.45 nm seen in the PF scattering plot is comparable to the segment length of the repeating TT units along the polymer chain. The PF or P3HTpolymers, when blended with PCBM, show a distinct bend or “Guinier knee” in this region, indicating that domains of ∼5–10 nm in size are present. In the PTB films, there is no indication of these domains. These results, along with the SEM images reported previously for blended PTB films,21 indicate that these films have a bi-continuous fibrous network of polymer and fullerene materials roughly 1 nm in size.

From ref. 18. (b)The GISAXS line trace for PTB6 and PTB3 blended films. For comparison, the same information for P3HT-blended film is shown. (Reproduced from ref. 51.) 
To summarize, the grazing incidence results show that the PTBpolymer has a favorable blended film morphology in two respects: (1) the orientation of the polymer backbone chain, which is favorable for charge transport in OPV devices and (2) the low crystallinity and nanofibrous nature of the polymer material, which increases the donor:acceptor interface area and therefore further facilitates charge separation in the material devices.
4. Exciton and charge separation dynamics in the low band gap polymer materials
The dynamics of fundamental electronic processes, such as exciton generation (EG), charge separation (CS), and charge recombination (CR) in OPV materials, are crucial for generating sufficient numbers of charge carriers for electron transport, and, ultimately, efficient photocurrent generation. These dynamic processes take place on the time scale of femtoseconds and longer, and hence can be probed by monitoring the optical signatures of transient species using ultrafast transient absorption/emission spectroscopy. The rate constants of the fundamental processes from the ultrafast spectroscopic measurements provide insight into optimization of solar cell efficiencies through energy levels and structures of polymer materials. The results from these studies, combined with the structural information obtained with X-ray methods, can help to find structural factors at single molecule and molecular assembly levels for enhancing the device PCE. The CS and CR dynamics of the pristine and blended PF and PTB1 films were measured by ultrafast optical transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy with an excitation pump wavelength of 600 nm. The spectral kinetics were monitored using two broad white light continuum light sources ranging from ∼500–750 nm in the visible region and ∼900–1600 nm in the NIR region. For the PF films, the spectral parameters have been described in great detail previously.18 The TA kinetics and transient spectra of PF:PCBM and PTB1:PCBM films are shown in Fig. 7. The scaled kinetic traces depicting CS and CR times for both polymers are shown in Fig. 7a while the absorption changes for the polymers are shown in Fig. 7b. For the PF films, the spectral parameters have been described in great detail previously.18 The cation peak formed after CS for both polymers was determined from the visible and NIR spectral results of the neat and blended films. The CS and CR kinetics were monitored at 700 nm, where little change in the absorption upon excitation is observed for neat PF films and the presence of the PF cation has been established. The PF:PCBM film exhibits two time constants for CS: τCS1 < 120 fs (77%) and τCS2 = 13.4 ps (23%). The two constants obtained for CR are τCR1 = 406 ps (13%) and τCR2 > 3 ns (87%).

The insets in both (a) and (b) are close ups of the kinetic traces at earlier times. (c and d) Transient spectra of (c) PF:PCBM and (d) PTB1:PCBM. (Reproduced from ref. 18 and 35.) 
Similar measurements were performed on the PTB1polymer films. The TA spectra in the PTB1:PCBM films showed an initial broad exciton absorption at 1320 nm that was quickly depleted, and a new peak at 1150 nm was formed within 0.5 ps of excitation.35 As was verified previously, the rise of the 1150 nm peak was due to the formation of the cation with a lifetime much longer than a few nanoseconds in the BHJ composite film. Because these two absorption peaks are both broad and overlapping in the NIR region, it becomes difficult to interpret the overall kinetics using the single wavelength transient absorption signals as employed in the PF transient absorption analysis. Therefore, the experimental TA spectra of the PTB1:PCBM composite films were decomposed into PTB1 cation and excited exciton absorption spectra. The change in amplitude of the cationic peak with respect to time is the kinetic trace represented in Fig. 7b. The PTB1:PCBM film exhibits a biexponential CS dynamics with two time constants of τCS1 = 370 fs (76%) and τCS2 = 5.9 ps (24%) and a biexponential CR dynamics with two constants of τCR1 = 931 ps (30%) and τCR2 ≥ 2.5 ns (70%). For the charge separation times, the PF showed a faster CS1 time and a slower CS2 time compared to PTB1. The first time constant (CS1) is attributed to the crystallinity-dependent charge separation mechanism directly at the donor:acceptor interface. More crystalline domains will exhibit clean interface surfaces, which facilitates CS. The second time constant (CS2) is attributed to the size dependent exciton diffusion in the materials. Therefore, the CS times are consistent with the morphology determined from the GIXS results described previously. In Fig. 7b, it is shown that the cationic peak amplitude is over five times greater for the PTB1:PCBM film compared to the PF:PCBM film. Although the PF kinetic trace is not at the cationic peak maximum, the kinetic spectra in Fig. 7c show a broad, flat spectrum for the cationic peak of PF, which indicates that the overall amplitude of the cationic peak is similar in the 700–1000 nm range. Furthermore, the excitonic spectra at early times for the PTB1:PCBM and PF:PCBMspectra have similar amplitudes, yet the amplitude of the cationic peak at several hundred picoseconds is much smaller for the PF:PCBM sample. This finding suggests that the smaller crystal formation significantly enhances the charge separation in the PTBpolymer films. Although the initial CR time, CR1, is slower for the PTB1 blended film, the overall amplitude is much higher for this decay compared to PF recombination. The larger amplitude of the recombination is rationalized by the increase of the donor:acceptor interface area in the PTBpolymers while the longer time constant is due to the enhanced roughness of these interfaces. The difference in CR2 could not be determined using the current experimental setup due to the short experimental time window. The larger amplitude of the cationic state is maintained in the PTB film after 2 ns, which is also consistent with the higher solar energy conversion of the PTBpolymer materials. The spectra for the PF and the PTB1 films are shown in Fig. 7c and d, respectively. The transient spectra also confirm the larger amplitude of the cationic state, and therefore the enhancement of charge separation, for the PTB1 sample. Assuming similar oscillator strengths for the cationic state of the polymer materials, the transient spectra are a direct measure of the relative amount of the cationic species formed in the blended films. The higher generation of separated carriers in the PTB1 film is explained by the increase of exciton diffusion to the BHJ interfaces. Annealing effects of both materials have also shown that the PTB films favor a much smaller domain size compared to PF or P3HTpolymers. Although it has been established that smaller domains are favored in the PTB blended films, the mechanisms for this discrepancy, such as the exciton diffusion length and presence of charge transfer states, will be probed in future works.
The electron withdrawing TT moiety in the PFpolymer effectively pulls charge density from adjacent thiophene units, which effectively causes electron density localization. Consequently, the exciton diffusion may be hindered, and the overall PCE of the OPV device may be affected. In PF, the TT moieties are 6.5 nm apart, so the exciton can become localized on the lower energy segments of the polymer chain. In order to investigate the exciton diffusion of PF, in comparison with homocyclic P3HT, fluorescence anisotropy measurements were carried out using the fluorescence upconversion. The polarization dependent signals of time-resolved fluorescence for the PF and P3HTpolymers in chlorobenzene are shown in Fig. 8.52 The measured fluorescence anisotropy decay time constant for PF is up to several nanoseconds, which cannot be accurately measured because the PF fluorescence lifetime is only 500 ps. What can be determined is that (a) the anisotropy decay can be approximately expressed using one time constant and (b) there is no indication of a fast anisotropy decay component within the instrument response range (300 fs) of this system. The fluorescence anisotropy of the P3HT molecule has also been measured both previously53,54 and in this study as a reference. The fluorescence anisotropy of a conjugated polymer, such as PF or P3HT, measures the dynamics for the exciton dipole orientational randomization due to exciton hopping or diffusion via intrachain and interchain mechanisms. The initial excitation of the polymer is concentrated on a short segment of the entire backbone, followed by the exciton migration through the backbone via a Förster type hopping mechanism. The fast fluorescence anisotropy decays observed in P3HT are attributed to this hopping mechanism. In the PFpolymer, however, this rapid exciton dipole orientational randomization due to the exciton hopping was not observed. Therefore, we can deduce that the exciton hopping is relatively slow in PF, and hence the dipole orientation would not randomize as fast as those of P3HT. This finding implies interplay between the exciton mobility and band gap energy in copolymers. The alternating high and low electron affinity units in the low band gap polymer chain sequence lower the exciton energy and effectively hinder the exciton mobility along the polymer backbone. The effects of the overall PCE on the exciton trapping in PF are still ambiguous. Although the exciton mobility of PF is lower compared to P3HT, the current density of the blended film, which is one of the main indicators of solar cell efficiency, is over 10.2 mA cm−2. This parameter is higher than reported for P3HT solar cells with over 5% PCE.55 The molecular weight of PCBM is 910.9 g mol−1, and the diameter of PCBM is about 1 nm. Typically polymer/oligomer blends with PCBM are optimized at roughly a 1:1 weight ratio. If the exciton diffusion length is comparable to the mean distance between PCBM acceptor molecules at the polymer/PCBM interface, then the hindering exciton migration effect can be minimal. This dependence will be probed further in future works. The anisotropy effects in the PTBpolymers will also be investigated.

In this report, we have shown that two energetically similar polymer species, PF and PTB, have drastically different PCEs when blended with PCBM. The solar cell morphology in PTB is more favorable, which explains the great enhancement in this material. Transient absorption spectroscopy and grazing incidence X-ray studies have verified this claim. We believe that these studies have paved the way to further investigate the interplay between the energetics, morphology, and kinetics in the series of high efficiency low band gap polymers. These polymers are relatively new in the realm of OPV materials. There is still a lot of potential to make these systems even more efficient in order to make OPV devices a viable energy alternative. Various studies on the substrate morphology and carrier generation states are currently underway in our group. We believe that further investigations on these materials will provide very fruitful information on the properties of these devices, which can be used to push the overall PCE of these materials closer to 10%.
