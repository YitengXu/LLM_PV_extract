    , Accepted 31st March 2022First published on 13th April 2022AbstractBiomimetic porous materials have contributed to the enhancement of solar-driven evaporation rate in interfacial desalination and clean water production. However, due to the presence of numerous microbes in water environment, biofouling should occur inside porous materials to clog the channels for water transfer, resulting in obvious inhibition of the solar-driven evaporation efficacy in long-term use. To prevent and control biofouling in porous materials for solar-driven evaporation, a facile and environment-friendly design is required in real application. Oak wood possesses vertically aligned channels for transpiration and polyphenol compounds with antimicrobial activity. In this work, inspired by the oak wood, we developed an anti-biofouling shape-memory chitosan scaffold with unidirectional channels and tannic acid coating (oak-inspired scaffold). The shape-memory property facilitated rapid decoration with oak-inspired photothermal and anti-biofouling coating inside the scaffold, respectively, which also promotes the material durability by avoiding the external force-induced permanent structure failure. More importantly, the oak-inspired tannic acid coating not only prevented bacterial adhesion and colonization, but also inhibited fungal interference. They were subjected to a microbe-rich environment, and after 3 days, the evaporation rates of the untreated chitosan scaffolds were obviously decreased to 1.24, 1.16 and 1.19 kg m−2 h−1 for C. albicans, S. aureus and E. coli, respectively, which were only 65.6, 61.4 and 63.0% of original performance (1.89 kg m−2 h−1). In comparison, the oak-inspired scaffold exhibited a high solar-driven water evaporation rate after incubation in microbial suspensions (1.80, 1.70 and 1.75 kg m−2 h−1 for C. albicans, S. aureus and E. coli after 3 days) and lake water (1.74 kg m−2 h−1 after one month). The bioinspired anti-biofouling scaffolds maintain as high as 86.7–91.8% of the solar-driven water evaporation ability after exposure to a microbe-rich environment, which is conducive to develop a biomimetic long-term durable structure in water treatment.
Introduction
By employing photothermal nanomaterials to convert solar energy into heat and then accelerate the generation of water vapor, interfacial solar evaporation offers an opportunity to produce clean water in a sustainable, eco-friendly and energy-efficient manner.1–4 Among various strategies, biomimetic synthesis to mimic the natural biological structure has played important roles in preparing advanced photothermal nanomaterials and assemblies for solar evaporation. For example, wood-derived scaffold5,6 and wood-mimic aerogels7,8 display high-performance solar evaporation, which were beneficial to water transport by utilizing or mimicking the natural vertically aligned channels in plants. Moreover, inspired by the natural structure of shaddock,9 water lily,10 pitcher plant11 and mushrooms,12 materials with advantages in thermal management, water directional transport and light capture have also promoted the enhancement in water evaporation rates.13
The biomimetic design in photothermal materials not only accelerated water evaporation, but also improved the management of materials’ long-term structural durability.14–17 Because solar evaporators are designed to work in impure water,18 it is necessary to prevent the absorption and accumulation of salt and contaminants, which could induce the clogging and fouling of structures.19 Previous studies have already demonstrated that the bioinspired design could improve the stability of photothermal materials in brines20–23 and oil-contaminated water,24–26 maintaining the initial performance in light harvest and vapor release. Besides the abiotic pollutants, biofouling induced by microorganisms is another critical constraint for the durability of water treatment materials and plants.27,28 Our previous investigation has showed that biomimetic aerogels with the anti-biofouling design could prevent a sharp decrease in water evaporation rates by inhibiting the clogging of pores.29 Despite prokaryotic microbes, natural water was also occupied by numerous eukaryotic microbes such as fungus, which equally account for the formation of biofilms on water purifiers.30 Therefore, upgrading the biomimetic strategy and achieving effective anti-fungal activity for photothermal materials are critical to promote their practical application of solar evaporation. Furthermore, metal-containing antimicrobial materials are toxic to non-target organisms,31 and non-degradable antibacterial polymer is threatening the global aquatic environment,32 so it is highly desirable to develop an environment-friendly and sustainable anti-biofouling strategy.33
Learning from nature, the biological system has already provided a feasible approach for the anti-biofouling design.34 As a natural antimicrobial material which contains polyphenols such as tannic acid (TA),35 oak wood has been used in wine preservation,36 European folk medicine and hygienically important constructions37 to withstand microbial infection for a long period. Meanwhile, the natural long-range vertically aligned channels (e.g. vessel) in oak wood38 ensure that transpiration, a natural water evaporation effect in trees, also inspired the structural design of anti-biofouling photothermal materials. In this work, we developed an oak-inspired anti-biofouling unidirectional scaffold for solar evaporation. Benefiting from the shape-memory property, the oak-inspired anti-biofouling chitosan scaffold with tannic acid coating (oak-inspired scaffold) could be obtained via facile surface modification of pure chitosan scaffolds during compression-release cycles. The as-prepared oak-inspired scaffold could prevent both bacteria- and fungus-induced biofouling, leading to efficient and stable solar evaporation even after culturing in microbial suspensions at a high concentration. Moreover, with the unidirectional porous structure, the oak-inspired scaffold was salt-resistant, which could work in brine.
Results and discussion
Preparation and characterization of the oak-inspired scaffold
Surface functionalization of the inner pores is essential for developing advanced macroscopic three-dimensional porous structural materials including various scaffolds.39–42 For the post-synthesis functionalization, effective molecules and species transfer played a critical role in achieving rapid and homogeneous modification of the scaffold. Accelerating the liquid flow and increasing the flux are useful methods to promote the mass transfer. For this reason, the shape-memory behavior is considered as a valuable property to realize efficient mass diffusion in scaffolds, as the absorption of liquid could be enhanced during recovering the initial structure.43 In contrast, the inelastic scaffold, such as native oak woods, is not an ideal platform to realize full and fast diffusion without any external driving force. Therefore, we utilized a shape-memory unidirectional chitosan scaffold as a platform for subsequent functionalization, and finally, obtained the oak-inspired anti-biofouling solar evaporator (Fig. 1a). The main process for the preparation of oak-inspired scaffolds is shown in Fig. 1b. First, a unidirectional pure chitosan scaffold was obtained by an ice-templating method. Second, the pure chitosan scaffold was compressed and soaked into a mixture solution of tannic acid and aminopropyltriethoxysilane (TA@APTES). Owing to the excellent shape-memory property, the compressed chitosan scaffold could recover to the initial shape and size after a few seconds, and such compression-release behavior in association with the unidirectional channels facilitates the fast diffusion of the TA@APTES solution into the inner pores of the chitosan scaffold. After several repeating compression-release cycles, the chitosan scaffold was successfully decorated with TA@APTES. Then, the upper surface of the chitosan-TA@APTES scaffold was immersed in a Fe3+ solution. According to the strong coordination interaction between iron ions and numerous phenolic hydroxyl groups of TA, a black TA-Fe3+ layer was formed at the upper surface of the chitosan scaffold. Finally, the oak-inspired scaffold was obtained after freeze-drying.

Fig. 2a shows that the oak-inspired scaffold was composed of two parts with different colors: the upper nearly black chitosan-TA@APTES-Fe3+ (CTAF) layer and the brown chitosan-TA@APTES (CTA) layer. According to the SEM investigation, the two layers were connected with vertically aligned channels, which provided direct pathways for water and steam transportation in solar evaporation (Fig. 2b–e and Fig. S1†). Highly magnified SEM images indicated the successful post-modification, evidenced by the rough inner surface of pores decorated with nanoparticles, other than a smooth and clean surface in a pure chitosan scaffold (Fig. 2d and Fig. S2†). Due to the observation of intense iron and silicon signal, EDS mapping analysis suggested the successful absorption of TA@APTES-Fe3+ on the chitosan scaffold (Fig. 2f). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirmed the above-mentioned conclusion, as Fe and Si peaks could be observed on the XPS spectrum of oak-inspired scaffolds, other than on the spectrum of the pure chitosan scaffold (Fig. S3a†). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) investigation also verified the coating of TA@APTES-Fe3+. In Fig. S3b,† –CN, benzene ring stretching vibrations and vibrations of TA-Fe3+ at 1635, 1540 and 760 cm−1 respectively44–46 can be found in the spectrum of oak-inspired scaffold. In comparison, such a specific signal disappeared in the spectrum of a pure chitosan scaffold. According to Fig. S4,† the water contact angle was extremely small (<5°) in the air for the oak-inspired scaffold, evidenced by the nearly flat water drop. After immersion in water for 2 minutes, the oak-inspired scaffold could absorb water, which is 23 times the weight of the scaffold itself. These results indicated high hydrophilicity of the oak-inspired scaffold, which could benefit the water transport and solar evaporation. The shape-memory property of the oak-inspired scaffold is shown in Fig. 2g, Fig. S5, S6 and Movie S1.† The compressed oak-inspired scaffold fully recovered in water, independent of the detailed origin shape of the scaffolds. The pictures and video showed that the oak-inspired scaffold recovered to the initial shape within 2 s after compression by approximately 90% under water (Fig. S6 and Movie S2†). Detailed shape memory property was also evaluated under water at a maximum strain of 50% using Instron 5565A. As shown in Fig. 2h–i and Fig. S7,† the chitosan and oak-inspired scaffolds recovered to their initial macroscopic shape during 100 cycles, with bare deformation perpendicular to the channel direction, and only 3.9% and 2.8% deformation parallel to the channel direction, respectively. The internal structure of the oak-inspired scaffold was analyzed with SEM. Compared with the freshly prepared sample, the oak-inspired scaffold did not show any obvious change in pores and channels, suggesting the structural stability after 100 compress-release cycles (Fig. S8†). As a result, the shape-memory oak-inspired scaffold could tolerate the external force such as water wave and manual operation, avoiding the permanent structure failure to promote its long-term use.

Anti-biofouling properties of the oak-inspired scaffold
As a polyphenolic compound in oak wood and many other plant tissues, tannic acid (TA) is a nature-derived antibacterial and anti-biofouling coating material.47 The oak-inspired scaffold was first subjected to the antimicrobial test by a disk diffusion method. The digital photos of the agar plates with different samples are shown in Fig. 3a. No obvious inhibition zone could be observed around pure chitosan scaffold samples, suggesting the weak antibacterial and antifungal effects. In contrast, the oak-inspired scaffold showed significant inhibition zones against all tested bacterial and fungal strains. The diameters of the inhibition zone for S. aureus, E. coli, and C. albicans were approximately 16.26, 15.59 and 15.30 mm, respectively (Fig. 3b). These results clearly demonstrated efficient antimicrobial properties of the oak-inspired scaffold against both bacterial and fungal pathogens.
 Fig. 3  (a) Digital photos and (b) diameters of inhibition zones of the oak-inspired scaffold and pure chitosan scaffold. (c) SEM images of the scaffold samples after incubation in microbial suspensions and natural lake water for 3 days and 1 month, respectively. 
To evaluate the anti-biofouling performance, SEM was used to investigate the biofouling on the scaffolds. According to Fig. 3c, a decrease in the pore size and even the clogging of the unidirectional channels could be observed on pure chitosan scaffolds, which were incubated with S. aureus, E. coli, and C. albicans suspensions after three days. Detailed SEM images showed that plenty of microbial cells accumulated in the pores of the scaffold, stacked with each other and formed a dense biofilm (Fig. 3c). Such study demonstrated that not only bacterial infection, but also fungal interference could induce biofouling on the porous materials for solar evaporation. The biofouling and the resulting clogging of the pores could also be found in the sample incubated in natural lake water, as a large number of spherical and rod-like cells adhered on the surface and the inner channels of chitosan scaffold. Moreover, as presented in Fig. S9,† the fungal mycelia with a long aspect ratio emerged in the C. albicans fouled scaffold, indicating that the microenvironment in the pure chitosan scaffold was favorable for the growth and reproduction of microbials.48 Thus, the clogging of pores and biofouling of scaffold are expected to be deteriorated, once the fungus continued growing and formed mycelial networks during long-term application in real water. Compared with the pure chitosan scaffold, the oak-inspired scaffold demonstrated remarkable anti-biofouling effects in both microbial suspensions and natural lake water. As shown in Fig. 3c, the absence of bacterial and fungal cells in pores confirmed that the oak-inspired scaffold could effectively inhibit the adhesion and reproduction of microbes, maintaining the initial porous structure.
The anti-biofouling effect of the oak-inspired scaffold was further investigated with the microscopic observation. In bright-field images, the channels and pores of the oak-inspired scaffold could be clearly identified without adhering impurities, which is in accordance with the images from the SEM analysis (Fig. 3c). However, the bacterial and fungal cells aggregated and covered on the surfaces and inner channels of the pure chitosan scaffold, which led to clogging of pores (Fig. 4). In confocal fluorescence images, strong green and red fluorescence signals could be observed for pure chitosan samples, showing the presence of abundant live and dead microbial cells (Fig. 4). In contrast, only weak fluorescence signals were observed from the oak-inspired scaffolds, suggesting few adhesion of bacterial and fungus cells onto the oak-inspired scaffold and the effective inhibition of biofouling (Fig. 4).

Stable solar evaporation performance of the anti-biofouling oak-inspired scaffold
The top layer of the oak-inspired unidirectional scaffold exhibited broad absorption toward sunlight in the wavelength range from 200 to 2500 nm, which was obviously efficient compared with the chitosan scaffold in light capture (Fig. 5a). After irradiation by simulated sunlight, the oak-inspired unidirectional scaffold exhibited a photothermal behavior rapidly. According to the real-time analysis with a thermal infrared imager, the top surface temperature of the oak-inspired unidirectional scaffolds floating on water quickly increased by 8.1 °C within 12 minutes under one sun irradiation, and subsequently increased another 2.2 °C after 60 minutes. In contrast, the upper surface temperature of the chitosan scaffold and pure water only increased 4.4 and 5.0 °C even after 60 minutes under the same irradiation (Fig. 5b). These results confirmed that the TA-Fe3+ coating played a key role in the solar-thermal conversion. Subsequently, such photothermal oak-inspired scaffold accelerated water evaporation under simulated sunlight irradiation, with an evaporation rate of approximately 1.96 kg m−2 h−1. According to previous studies, the unidirectional structures exhibited several fundamental merits including salt-resistance, fast water transport and thermal insulation in the horizontal direction, which should play important roles in efficient solar evaporation.49,50

Microbes distribute in most of the real water such as seawater,51 river water,52 city sewage,53 groundwater and industrial waste water.54,55 Microbial cells should multiplicate, colonize, and attach to the water purification materials,56,57 resulting in the deterioration of their performance and increasing economic cost during solar evaporation. For instance, our previous study has demonstrated that the water evaporation rates and efficiency decreased sharply once the scaffold fouled by a bacterial biofilm.29
Due to the wide distribution of fungus in a water environment, in our current investigation, the effect of fungal interference on solar evaporation was studied using a photothermal CS-TF scaffold as control (chitosan scaffold with TA-APTES-Fe3+ decoration on the top surface). In pure water, both of the CS-TF and the oak-inspired unidirectional scaffold could efficiently accelerate water evaporation under 1 sun, exhibiting evaporation rates of 1.89 and 1.96 kg m−2 h−1 and energy conversion efficiencies of 86.0% and 89.5%, respectively (Fig. 5c and d). However, the water weight loss through the CS-TF scaffold decreased 34.4% after incubation in a fungal suspension (Fig. 5d). Influenced by the pore clogging, the water evaporation rate was reduced to only 1.24 kg m−2 h−1 for the CS-TF scaffold, which is much lower than the performance before suffering biofouling (Fig. 5d). The bacterial exposure also reduced the evaporation performance of the CS-TF scaffold. Due to fouling by S. aureus and E. coli, the water evaporation rates decreased to 1.16 and 1.19 kg m−2 h−1, respectively, resulting in sharp declines of about 38.6% and 37.0% (Fig. 5c and d). To evaluate the anti-biofouling and evaporation performance in actual application, natural lake water was collected for investigation. After one month incubation, the CS-TF scaffold suffered obvious pore clogging (Fig. 3c). Such material biofouling led to approximately 33.3% decrease in the water evaporation rate, with steam generation at 1.26 kg m−2 h−1 (Fig. 5c and d). These investigations clearly showed that biofouling plays an important role in influencing the durability of porous evaporation materials.
Compared with the non-antimicrobial controls, the oak-inspired unidirectional scaffold with bioinspired anti-biofouling design exhibited steady evaporation performance before and after microbial exposure. The evaporation rates of the oak-inspired unidirectional scaffold were 1.80, 1.70 and 1.75 kg m−2 h−1, after incubation in C. albicans, S. aureus and E. coli suspensions, respectively (Fig. 5c and d). Such behaviors were only 8.2%, 13.3% and 10.7% lower than the initial performance, which were obviously superior to the non-antimicrobial analogues. The stable evaporation through the oak-inspired unidirectional scaffold was also expressed in natural water. After immersion in lake water for one month, the water evaporation rate decreased 11.2%, achieving 1.74 kg m−2 h−1 in steam generation, which was higher than that of the CS-TF scaffold (Fig. 5c and d). Additionally, the released TA from the scaffold were 0.22% and 0.25% in weight after 2 and 5 days (Fig. S10†), respectively, indicating the stability of the antimicrobial coating. The above-mentioned results clearly indicated that the bioinspired anti-biofouling design effectively inhibited the deterioration of solar evaporation performance in microbe-rich waters, which could achieve stable evaporation in actual water purification (Fig. 5c and d).
Desalination, salt resistance and water purity investigations
Artificial seawater was employed to study the desalination performance. The oak-inspired unidirectional scaffold could continue to accelerate the water evaporation for 12 h, with an evaporation rate of 1.95 kg m−2 h−1 (Fig. 6a). Meanwhile, owing to the vertically aligned channels and super-hydrophilicity, the oak-inspired unidirectional scaffold showed solid stable evaporation performance during 15 working cycles in brines, and left a salt-free top surface after continuous evaporation, suggesting salt tolerance behavior during long-term desalination (Fig. 6a and b). The salt-resistance function worked effectively even after spraying 0.1 g NaCl crystal on the upper surface of oak-inspired scaffolds. The crystal disappeared quickly within 60 min, indicating the successful dissolution of NaCl through the vertically aligned channels, which could supply sufficient water to transfer the salts back to the bulk water by capillary action (Fig. 6d). Condensate water was collected to evaluate the artificial sea water desalination quality. According to the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analysis, the concentrations of Na, Mg, K and Ca ions in condensate water were 1.38, 0.13, 0.38 and 0.04 mg L−1, much lower than the value in brines, which reached the drinking water standard of China (Fig. 6c). This investigation clearly demonstrated the potential of the oak-inspired unidirectional scaffold for long-term sea water desalination. Moreover, the oak-inspired unidirectional scaffold could serve as an effective material for sewage treatment, evidenced by the decline of heavy metal and dye concentrations in condensate water (Fig. S11†). In addition, the absence of microorganisms on the agar plate sprayed with condensed water further confirmed that the oak-inspired unidirectional scaffold could be used for water purification (Fig. S12†).

Conclusions
In this work, an anti-biofouling shape-memory unidirectional scaffold has been fabricated, inspired by the vertically aligned channel and natural polyphenol antimicrobial compounds in oak woods. The shape-memory behavior facilitated the rapid decoration of antimicrobial and photothermal agents and promoted the structural durability. As a result, the as-prepared oak-inspired unidirectional scaffold showed a high evaporation rate of 1.95 kg m−2 h−1 in artificial sea water, and was stable during 15 working cycles. Furthermore, the scaffold could withstand both bacterial and fungal infection, and protect the scaffold from channel clogging and fouling. The oak-inspired unidirectional scaffold showed only a slight decrease in water evaporation rates after incubation in bacterial suspensions (10.7–13.3%), fungal suspensions (8.2%) and natural lake water (11.2%), respectively. In comparison, the analogous photothermal scaffold but without anti-biofouling design showed 33.3–38.6% decline in evaporation rates. Therefore, the oak-inspired anti-biofouling shape-memory scaffold could obviously improve the lifetime of solar evaporation in actual environments, which is conducive to developing long-term durable structures.
Experimental
Materials
Chitosan (viscosity 100–200 mPa s), tannic acid (TA), and aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) were purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai, China). Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane was obtained from Sangon Biotech. Ferric sulfate was purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. Ethanol, methanol, tert-butanol, acetic acid, and sodium hydroxide were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co, Ltd, China. All the reagents were used without further purification.
Fabrication of the chitosan unidirectional scaffold
A chitosan solution was obtained by dissolving the power in 1% acetic acid solution under magnetic stirring. The chitosan unidirectional scaffold was fabricated according to the previously reported ice-templating method.58 Briefly, the chitosan solution was poured into a polystyrene mold placed on a pre-cooled copper plate. The temperature of the cold plate was mediated by liquid nitrogen and controlled at approximately −30 °C. After frozen entirely, the obtained samples were lyophilized. The resulting unidirectional scaffold was rinsed with a sodium hydroxide solution, washed with pure water, methanol, and tert-butanol, respectively and then freeze-dried.
Fabrication of the oak-inspired unidirectional scaffold
A TA solution (0.2 wt%) was prepared by dissolving TA powder (0.2 g) in 100 mL of buffer solution (Tris-HCl, pH = 8.5, 100 mL), and then the ethanol (20 mL) solution containing APTES (0.2 g) was dropped into the TA solution.59 The chitosan-TA@APTES (CTA) unidirectional scaffold was prepared by soaking the compressed pure chitosan scaffold into TA-APTES solution. After several compress-release cycles, TA molecules were absorbed into the chitosan scaffold. Then, the modified material upper surface was immersed into a Fe2(SO4)3 solution (50 mL, 2 mg mL−1) until it completely turned black.
Fabrication of the CS-TF unidirectional scaffold
The chitosan scaffold with TA@APTES-Fe3+ decoration on the top surface (CS-TF) was prepared by soaking the top layer of the pure chitosan scaffold into a TA@APTES solution. Then, the upper surface was immersed into a Fe2(SO4)3 solution (50 mL, 2 mg mL−1) until it completely turned black.
Solar-driven water evaporation evaluation
A xenon lamp was employed to simulate the solar beam, and the light intensity of the illumination on the top surface of the scaffold was adjusted to 1 kW m−2. During the illumination, the weight loss due to water evaporation was recorded using an electronic balance (Sartorius BSA224S), and the temperature was simultaneously recorded using an IR camera (Fluke Ti400). Purified water was collected for inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (Optima 7300 DV) (ICP-AES) tests. The corresponding photothermal conversion efficiency was calculated under one sun irradiation (1 kW m−2). For the evaluation of desalination performance, the oak-inspired unidirectional scaffold was operated in artificial seawater under 1 sun for 12 h continuous water evaporation test. The cycle stability of the oak-inspired unidirectional scaffold was determined in artificial seawater under one sun for 15 times evaporation test.
Disk-diffusion assay

E. coli and S. aureus were cultivated in Luria–Bertani broth at 37 °C, and C. albicans was cultivated in yeast extract-peptone-dextrose broth at 30 °C, respectively. After shaking at 100 rpm for approximately 18–20 h, highly concentrated microbial suspensions (108 CFU mL−1) were obtained. The raw microbial suspensions were diluted to 105 CFU mL−1. Then, 100 μL microbial suspensions (105 CFU mL−1) were spread onto the solidified agar plates. Subsequently, such agar plates were adhered with scaffolds and incubated in the darkness at 37 °C (E. coli and S. aureus) and 30 °C (C. albicans), respectively. The inhibition zones were measured after 24 h cultivation.
Anti-biofouling test
To investigate the biofilm formation and biofouling, the scaffolds were cultivated in microbial suspensions supplemented with LB broth for 72 h, and then, subjected to the SEM analysis and water evaporation test. Meanwhile, the microbe-treated oak-inspired unidirectional scaffold and pure chitosan scaffold were also analyzed using an inverted fluorescence microscope (IX81 Olympus).
Characterization
The morphologies of the scaffolds were observed using a scanning electron microscope (Zeiss Merlin). EDS spectra were recorded using an X-Max (Oxford) instrument. XPS spectra were recorded using a Thermo ESCALAB250xi. The optical absorptions of absorbers were recorded using a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere (UV-3101, Shimadzu). Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of absorbers were recorded using a Nicolet 67 (Thermo Fisher) at room temperature. Mechanical testing was conducted using an Instron 5565A equipped with 500 N load cells. UV-Vis absorption spectrum of absorbers was recorded using a UV-2600 (SHIMADZU, Kyoto, Japan). Water contact angle was determined using a CAST 2.0 contact-angle-analysis system (Solon Information Technology).
