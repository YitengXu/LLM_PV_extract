    , Accepted 23rd June 2018First published on 25th June 2018AbstractTwo-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides are gaining increasing interest due to their promising optical properties. In particular, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) which displays a band-gap change from indirect at 1.29 eV for bulk materials to direct at 1.8 eV for the material monolayer. This particular effect can lead to a strong light interaction which can pave the way for a new approach to the next generation of visible light emitting devices. In this work we show the nanoscale variation of light emission properties by tip-enhanced photoluminescence microscopy and spectroscopy in the MoS2 monolayer, grown by chemical vapour deposition. The variations of the light emission properties are due to different effects depending on the shape of the MoS2 single layer, for instance, a different concentration of point defect in an irregularly shaped flake and the presence of a nanoscale terrace in a triangular monolayer. Simultaneously, atomic force microscopy reveals indeed the presence of a nanometric terrace, composed of an additional layer of MoS2, and tip-enhanced PL intensity imaging shows a localized intensity decrease.
1. Introduction
Semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers (MLs), like MoS2 or WS2, have been proposed as promising channel materials for optoelectronic applications.1,2 One of the advantages of two-dimensional (2D) TMDs, e.g. with respect to graphene, comes from quantum confinement, enabling the indirect-to-direct band-gap transition as a function of the film thickness.1,3 Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is a promising 2D nano-material for next-generation photovoltaic solar cells,4 optoelectronic circuits,5,6 and sensors,7–9 due to its great excitonic recombination property, high carrier mobility,9 and low leakage current.10 The device performance strongly depends on the band structure of MoS2 near the K-point due to the peculiar valley effects.11 Single layer MoS2 has a band gap of about 1.8 eV,3 which is observed through photoluminescence spectroscopic analysis (PL). The PL spectrum shows two peaks due to the A0 and A− excitonic features. The A0 mode, derived from an exciton, consists of one electron and one hole bound by Coulomb interaction. The A− mode, derived from a trion (charged three body excitons), consists of an exciton combined with another electron.1,12 The variations in the PL spectra are due to an expression of an exciton and a trion. Such variations can be used to characterize the electrical and optical properties of a material and tune the performance of the optoelectronic devices. In addition, the PL signal is extremely sensitive to the number of layers composing the flake, and the presence of a nanometric terrace with a higher number of MoS2 can drastically affect the efficiency of the luminescence.1,13 For nanodevices, it is crucial to characterize these properties at the nanometer scale. Most optical techniques such as Raman spectroscopy are limited in spatial resolution and cannot probe localized nano-properties. In contrast, tip-enhanced hyphenated techniques based on the plasmonic amplification of the signal at the nanoscale will allow for actual nano-characterization.14–22 Previous tip-enhanced PL studies showed that the PL spectra of the exfoliated MoS2 single layer varied with the number of layers and the work function of a metal tip to contact.14 In addition tip-enhanced PL is employed to study the local strain induced light emission variation at the nanoscale in WSe2 monolayers grown by physical vapour transport.23 Nevertheless, nano-resolved PL analysis investigating the variations of the light emission properties inside MoS2 monolayers, grown by chemical vapour deposition (CVD), has not yet been reported. In fact, while a PL intensity decrease with increasing layer number was reported using non-spatially resolved Raman spectroscopy,13,24 the nanoscale correlation between the PL intensity decrease and shifts in Raman modes among the same flake has never been shown. In this article, we performed tip-enhanced photoluminescence (TEPL) and tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) analysis on a CVD grown MoS2 monolayer on a SiO2/Si substrate. The analysis of irregularly shaped and triangular monolayers reveals PL variations among the same monolayer. PL peak shift and intensity distributions in the triangular MoS2 single layer revealed the presence of a nanometric terrace, confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Meanwhile, the localized TEPL decrease and shift at the centre of the irregularly shaped MoS2 flake are attributed to the inhomogeneous distribution of point defects. Simultaneous near-field Raman and PL analyses provide complementary information about the structure and optical properties of MoS2, which clearly demonstrates the superiority of this nano-spectroscopic technique.
2. Experimental
MoS2 flakes are synthesized in a 2′′ diameter open tube furnace using S, MoOx and MoS2 powders and nitrogen as the carrier gas. Flakes are obtained on silicon substrates covered by an ∼290 nm thick SiO2 thermal oxide. SiO2 guarantees a clear identification of the flakes under an optical microscope.25 Prior to the growth, the substrates were cleaned by sonication in acetone, isopropanol and ultrapure water. In order to enhance the nucleation and growth of the flakes, perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) is used as a promoter.26 25 mg of PTCDA are dissolved in 5 cc of ultrapure water and some droplets of this solution are dispersed on a second silicon substrate. Water is evaporated in a standard oven at 40 °C in a few hours. The SiO2/Si and the PTCDA/Si substrates are placed on a graphite susceptor, with the PTCDA/Si adjacent and immediately downstream of the SiO2/Si substrate. A quartz boat is loaded with 35 mg of sulfur and placed upstream of the furnace. Another quartz boat, with a mixture of 35 mg MoOx and 75 mg MoS2 powders, is placed about 20 cm from the S boat. The graphite susceptor with the substrates is positioned downstream near the boat containing the Mo precursors. The growth starts upon heating the Mo powders and the substrates at the target temperature of 700 °C in about 15 minutes, under a 300 sccm N2 flow. We assume that during this heating ramp the PTCDA decomposes (its melting point is about 350 °C) and a small quantity diffuses upstream in the gas phase, to deposit on SiO2. The PTCDA forms small seeds that act as nucleation centres for the growth of subsequent MoS2 flakes. After substrate temperature stabilization, the S boat is heated to 140 °C in about 2 minutes and the system is maintained under these conditions for 10 minutes under 300 sccm N2 flow. At the end of the process, the system is naturally cooled to room temperature.
A NanoRaman system (HORIBA Scientific) combining an atomic force microscope (SmartSPM) with a Raman spectrometer (LabRam HR Evolution) is used for tip-enhanced PL and Raman measurements on single- and bi-layer MoS2 samples. The system is based on a reflection configuration capable of approaching an objective lens (Mitutoyo, ×100 magnification, NA = 0.7) with an angle of 30° to the sample surface. Incident light is focused through the objective lens onto the apex of the cantilever-based Ag TERS tip probe (20 nm apex radius). A p-polarized light is introduced to enhance the electronic components along the tip axis so that it induces strong electronic fields at the apex of the tip. Both 594 and 633 nm laser excitation wavelengths are used for TEPL and TERS. The TEPL signal is collected with the same objective lens as for illumination. TEPL and TERS images are collected from 1 μm2 regions with <20 nm pixel steps. The acquisition time of each TEPL and TERS spectrum ranges from 0.1 to 0.2 seconds (one spectrum/image pixel). The spatial resolution of TEPL and TERS is 40 nm and 60 nm, respectively. The evaluation of the spatial resolution is performed for both TEPL and TERS by considering the line profiles of several experimental data. The nanoscale spatial resolution of TERS and TEPL has been well established by previous studies.14,23
3. Results and discussion
Simultaneous AFM, TERS and TEPL measurements with the laser wavelength of 594 nm are conducted on the irregularly shaped MoS2 single layer as shown in Fig. 1a–c, respectively. During this measurement, a laser power of 440 μW and an acquisition time of 200 ms were selected for each spectrum. Both spectral maps correspond well to the topographical map. The TERS spectra feature peculiar normal vibration modes of MoS2 denoted as E2g, A1g and 2LA(M) as shown in Fig. 1d.

(d) Normal vibration modes of E2g, A1g and 2LA of the TERS spectrum enlarged from (e) a typical spectrum of tip-enhanced Raman and PL spectroscopy. The red rectangle represented in (e) shows the spectrum area for photoluminescence. 
The ratio of PL intensity to Raman intensity (Fig. 1e) is 14 while the difference in the Raman shift between the E2g and A1g modes is 20 cm−1. These results confirm that the MoS2 flake is a single layer.13,27,28
The 2LA(M) mode with 594 nm (2.09 eV) excitation indicates that the resonance window of Raman scattering is larger than 130 meV in terms of its resonance condition with 633 nm (1.96 eV).27,29,30 The aforementioned value was calculated simply by the difference of resonance energies: 2.09 eV − 1.96 eV = 130 meV. It is worth noting that a strong decrease of the PL intensity occurs in the centre of the flake in the TEPL map, even if the AFM morphological map reveals no change in the flake thickness. The PL intensity decrease is consistent with what was previously reported by Gutierrez et al. for WS2 triangular monolayers. The enhancement of the PL at the flake edges is due to the localization of excitons at the flake edges related to the presence of lattice defects such as edge dipoles, or vacancies.2 In addition, defect induced PL enhancement has been previously reported in the case of the MoS2 flake.31
The spectrum recorded in each point by TEPL measurement is fitted through a regression analysis to obtain the position of the maximum (Fig. 2b). The peak position map is, then, reported in Fig. 2a, clearly showing a spatial dependence of the peak position. A red shift in the wavelength at the centre of MoS2 is observed. The TEPL peak shifts from 677 nm (1.83 eV) at the flake edges to 681 nm (1.82 eV) at the centre. This TEPL blue shift is explained in terms of conversion from trion to exciton emissions in the presence of highly defective areas.31

In order to obtain a deeper insight of the optical properties of the MoS2 monolayer at the nanoscale, we carry out TEPL with a different excitation source: a 633 nm laser. Each spectrum was obtained with a laser power of 88 μW and an acquisition time of 100 ms. Fig. 3a shows the TEPL intensity map generated from integrating the PL intensity over the 650–690 nm range. The TEPL peak position is slightly blue-shifted in comparison with the spectra of Fig. 2b, due to the lower excitation power, employed in this experiment. From this image, it is clear that the TEPL signal dropped at the flake centre. The PL intensity can decrease rapidly with the number of layers.13 The AFM image (Fig. 3b) shows step-like morphology variance at the centre of the MoS2 flake, revealing the presence of a nanoscale terrace. Indeed, the line profile in Fig. 3c from the dotted line across the MoS2 flake (see the image in Fig. 3c) shows that the island is twice as thick at the centre than at the edge, which confirms the presence of a bilayer terrace. The comparison of the PL spectra recorded in the central and peripheral areas of the MoS2 flake indicates a decrease in intensity at the centre position without any peak shift, which is shown in Fig. 3d. The superimposed 3D image of the AFM and TEPL images (Fig. 3e) clearly shows the relationship between the PL intensity and the surface morphology change.

(d) PL spectra recorded at the centre and the periphery of a MoS2 flake. (e) TEPL intensity superimposed on the 3D AFM image. x, y and z axes show the space coordinates and the color represents the PL intensity. 
To explain this relationship, we performed TERS measurements with a laser wavelength of 633 nm on a pure hexagonal MoS2 monolayer and a pure bilayer, so that both are captured in the same image as shown in Fig. 4. The laser power and acquisition time for each spectrum were 78 μW and 100 ms, respectively. Fig. 4a and b show the TEPL/TERS and AFM images of MoS2 flakes, respectively. In the TERS spectra (Fig. 4c), the A1g mode from bilayer MoS2 is located at 408 cm−1 whereas the one from single layer MoS2 is centered at 405 cm−1. The number of layers is thus confirmed by the peak separation between these A1g and E2g modes. This is consistent with the AFM line profile image shown in Fig. 4d, which indicates that the topologically identified bilayer MoS2 is optically verified to be a bilayer as well. A noticeable difference between the TEPL image and the AFM image is that the bilayer MoS2 flake almost disappeared from the TEPL image. This is consistent with the previous observation of a localized intensity decrease at the centre of the previously probed triangular shaped MoS2 flake (Fig. 3a). The formation of inhomogeneous flakes has been previously observed and explained due to local instabilities in the growth process.32,33 It is worth noting the presence of round grains on the flakes. These round grains are mainly due to material ageing in air; the nature of these grains is still an open issue, even if it is due to sulphur loss.33 In this regard the TERS and TEPL analyses give interesting insights into the nature of these round grains. In fact, the TEPL map (Fig. 3a) does not show any particular contrast, revealing that these grains do not absorb or scatter the light of the excitation laser. In addition, TERS spectroscopy reveals that these grains are probably metallic or amorphous because they do not have any mode in the analysed range. Therefore, it is possible to propose that these grains are composed of pure metallic molybdenum or amorphous molybdenum oxide.34

4. Conclusion
In this present work, the TEPL and TERS imaging, of CVD-grown MoS2 flakes, is performed simultaneously. The concurrent analysis of the morphological and optical properties demonstrates that TEPL is a unique tool to study 2D materials at the nanoscale. In fact we demonstrate that the TEPL variation in the peak position and intensity can be due to different effects in the CVD grown MoS2 monolayer. The PL shift and variation in intensity can be due to different concentrations of point defects or the presence of a nanoscale terrace. In fact, we find that different concentrations of point defects induce PL enhancement and blue-shift at the flake edges in the perfectly flat irregularly shaped MoS2 monolayer. Meanwhile, we demonstrate, by comparing the AFM topological and TEPL intensity map, the decrease of PL intensity due to a nanoscale bilayer terrace on the MoS2 triangular monolayer. This is also confirmed by TERS analysis, evaluating the peak separation between the E2g and A1g modes.
