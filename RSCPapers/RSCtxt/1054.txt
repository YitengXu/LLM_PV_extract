    , Accepted 26th May 2020First published on 28th May 2020AbstractAn NC-FIC nonfullerene acceptor, using a didodecylnaphthodithiophene (NDT) embedded octacyclic ladder-type donor NC, had been described previously. In this work, a new cross-shaped TC-FIC nonfullerene acceptor is designed by substitution of the NDT unit in the NC skeleton with a 2-dimensional didodecyltetrathienonaphthalene (TTN) unit. The 2-dimensional TC π-system with two vertically fused thiophenes strengthens the electron-donating ability, promotes π-electron delocalization and enhances intramolecular donor–acceptor charge transfer and intermolecular π–π interactions. As a result, TC-FIC shows more red-shifted and widened absorption compared to the NC-FIC counterpart. The PBDB-T:TC-FIC device exhibits a higher efficiency of 11.6% which greatly outperformed the corresponding PBDB-T:NC-FIC device with an efficiency of 7.52%. The dramatic 54% enhancement in efficiency is ascribed to the improved light-harvesting ability and enhanced charge mobilities which are benefited from the central 2-dimensional TTN moiety. By incorporating PC71BM to improve absorption and electron transport, the ternary-blend PBDB-T:TC-FIC:PC71BM device (1:1:1 in wt%) achieves a highest PCE of 13.49% with an enhanced Jsc of 23.80 mA cm−2, an FF of 64.4%, and a Voc of 0.88 V.
Introduction
Organic-based nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) have emerged as new-generation n-type materials to replace traditional fullerene derivatives for achieving high-performance organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs).1–8 The acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) architecture has been widely adopted in making low band-gap NFAs. The optical and electrochemical behaviors of A–D–A-type NFAs can be readily fine-tuned and controlled by properly selecting the combination of donor and acceptor components.9–16 The current state-of-the-art A–D–A NFAs utilize a ladder-type donor (LD) consisting of multifused aromatic (benzene),17–21 and heteroaromatic (thiophene or selenophene) rings.22–28 Besides, an sp3-hybridized carbon bridge in a cyclopentadienyl (CP) moiety embedded into the multifused frameworks is also an important component to ring-lock the adjacent rings and introduce alkyl chains for sufficient solubility. The force planarization of 1-dimensional LDs elongates effective conjugation, facilitates intramolecular D–A interactions and enhances intrinsic charge mobility.26,29–33 Extensive research has been directed to developing symmetrical LDs flanked with aliphatic side chains for constructing new NFAs.34–40 Extending the conjugation length of a 1-dimensional LD along its horizontal direction is a straightforward strategy to further enhance π-delocalization and strengthen π–π interactions, thus improving the light-harvesting ability and charge mobility.25,27,37,41–43 As a result, numerous 1-dimensional hexacyclic,44–46 heptacyclic,47–53 octacyclic,25,41,54–56 nonacyclic,37,42,57,58 and decacyclic19,26,27,59,60 multifused-ring LDs have thus been reported to make high-performance A–LD–A NFAs. It is envisaged that extending the conjugation of a linear LD along its perpendicular direction to form a 2-dimensional (2-D) LD could further magnify the advantages of chemical planarization and rigidification.61,62 This molecular engineering has been applied to make p-type polymers and n-type NFAs with improved performance (shown in Fig. S1†).60,63–65 However, development of a 2-D ladder-type structure is challenging and requires subtler design and synthesis. In 2013, we first reported a facile synthesis of the angular-shaped 4,9-didodecylnaphthodithiophene (4,9-NDT) and its isomeric derivatives.66 The 4,9-NDT-incorprated donor–acceptor copolymer has shown good OPV performance and high OFET mobility.67,68 Recently, we reported a new octacyclic ladder-type structure NC where a central 4,9-NDT core is connected with two outer thiophenes and ring-locked by two carbon bridges (Fig. 1). The diformylated NC was condensed with two FIC (1,1-dicyanomethylene-5,6-difluoro-3-indanone) acceptors to form an A–LD–A NFA called NC-FIC.69 Unfortunately, the NC-FIC-based device only showed a moderate OPV performance. It is desirable to further modify the structure of NC for optimization of properties. In 2016, we first synthesized a didodecyltetrathienonaphthalene (TTN) with excellent solubility and stronger absorptivity.70 By replacing the 4,9-didodecyl NDT unit in NC with the 5,11-didodecyl TTN moiety, a 2-D ladder-type didodecyltetrathienonaphthalenyldi(cyclopentathiophene) (denoted as TC) was prepared. In this research, a new 2-dimensional NFA named TC-FIC was prepared by condensation of the diformylated TC with the FIC acceptor (Fig. 1). The evolution from NC to TC grants TC-FIC several benefits in optical and electronic properties such as the following: (1) 2-D conjugated TC increases the electron-donating ability to induce stronger intramolecular charge transfer, which can broaden absorption to the NIR region; (2) two vertically fused thiophene units in TTN will stabilize the quinoidal form of the central LD, allowing more efficient π-electron delocalization; (3) TC with a larger π-system might facilitate inter- and intramolecular charge transport.

Results and discussion
The synthetic route to make the TC-FIC acceptor is shown in Scheme 1 and the detailed procedures are presented in the ESI.† The synthesis of 2,8-distannyl-5,11-didodecyl αβ-TTN (1) has been described in our previous work.70 Compound 1 was reacted with ethyl 2-bromothiophene-3-carboxylate via Stille coupling to obtain compound 2 in a yield of 70%. The double nucleophilic additions of compound 2 with 4-hexylphenylmagnesium bromide followed by acidic intramolecular cyclization resulted in the formation of TC in a yield of 63%. Treatment of TC with POCl3/DMF via Vilsmeier–Haack reaction afforded the diformylated TC derivative (TC-CHO) in a yield of 72%. Finally, the target TC-FIC was prepared by Knoevenagel condensation of TC-CHO with 1,1-dicyanomethylene-5,6-difluoro-3-indanone (FIC) in a yield of 71%. All the intermediates and target product were fully characterized by NMR and HR-MS. TC-FIC showed excellent solubility in halogenated solvents such as dichloromethane (DCM) and chloroform (CF) at ambient temperature. TC-FIC showed sufficient thermal stability with a decomposition temperature (Td) of 352 °C, as determined from thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves (Fig. S2†). The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves of TC-FIC showed no thermal transitions during the heating/cooling cycles (Fig. S2†).

The normalized absorption spectra of NC-FIC and TC-FIC and the optical parameters are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1, respectively. In solution, TC-FIC exhibited a strong absorption peak in the 570–800 nm range. The maximum absorption peak (λmax) at 719 nm with a larger extinction coefficient of 2.28 × 105 M−1 cm−1 in CHCl3 is more red-shifted than that of NC-FIC (λmax at 690 nm) as shown in Fig. S3.†

In the film state, TC-FIC showed a red-shifted λmax at 770 nm with the absorption onset at 850 nm corresponding to a smaller Eoptg of 1.46 eV. It should be emphasized that TC-FIC exhibited a much broader absorption window (full width at half maximum (FWHM) = 148 nm for TC-FIC and 66 nm for NC-FIC) and a stronger vibronic shoulder than NC-FIC in the film state as shown in Fig. 2. Also note that TC-FIC and NC-FIC showed a FWHM value of 102 nm and 82 nm in solution, respectively. TC-FIC exhibited a much increased FWHM value from solution to the solid state. These behaviors also imply the strong intermolecular interactions of TC-FIC. The wider absorption of TC-FIC is beneficial to the light-harvesting ability for enhancement of Jsc. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to examine the electrochemical properties of TC-FIC and NC-FIC (Fig. 2). The ionization potential (IP)/electron affinity (EA) was estimated according to the onset oxidation and reduction potentials, respectively (Fig. S4†). Compared with NC-FIC (IP/EA = −5.43/−3.94), TC-FIC exhibited a slightly higher-lying IP value of −5.42 eV but slightly lower-lying EA value of −4.00 eV, with respect to the vacuum level, resulting in a narrower energy band gap of 1.42 eV (Table 1). The optical and electrochemical results indicated that the vertically extended tetrathienonaphthalene central core in TC-FIC not only enhanced the electron-donating ability for stronger intramolecular ICT but also promoted the intermolecular interactions in the film state.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the wB97XD/6-311G(d,p) level were performed to further gain insights into the electronic influences of NC-FIC and TC-FIC. The hexyl and dodecyl groups were simplified into methyl groups. As shown in Fig. 3, the electron-density of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is predominantly localized at the central electron-rich moiety for NC-FIC and TC-FIC, while the electron-density of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is more dispersed along the entire π-system. It is worth mentioning that the electron-density of HOMO is extended into the vertically fused thiophenes in TC-FIC, indicating that the central TTN unit strongly participates in the donor–acceptor orbital interactions, which in turn alters the optical and orbital properties. The calculated cationic/anionic charge densities of TC-FIC and NC-FIC are shown in Fig. S5.† The energy level of the cationic/anionic molecular orbitals were used to calculate the IP/EA of TC-FIC (6.32/2.99 eV) and NC-FIC (6.48/2.98 eV), respectively (Table S2†). Meanwhile, we intentionally calculated the dipole moment of the half molecule, since the overall dipole moment of the symmetrical NFA will be canceled. TC-FIC showed a larger dipole moment of 10.84 D than NC-FIC (9.37 D), suggesting the stronger electron-donating capability of the TC unit.

Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells with an inverted architecture of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag were fabricated. The active layer was composed of the wide-bandgap PBDB-T as the p-type polymer and nonfullerene/fullerene as the n-type material. In addition, the corresponding PBDB-T:NC-FIC-based devices were also prepared for a systematic comparison.69 The J–V curves, the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra and the device parameters are shown in Fig. 4 and Table 2, respectively. The PBDB-T:TC-FIC-based device exhibited an improved performance and a high average PCE of 11.04 ± 0.51% with an impressive short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 21.87 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.90 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 58.7%, achieving a significantly higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.55% relative to the PBDB-T:NC-FIC-based device (7.52%). The PCE improvement is mainly attributed to the increased Jsc from 15.19 mA cm−2 for PBDB-T:NC-FIC to 21.87 mA cm−2 for PBDB-T:TC-FIC. As shown in Fig. 4, the PBDB-T:TC-FIC-based device displayed a wide-ranging spectral response from 300 to 870 nm and reached a maximum EQE value of 76% at 785 nm. The greatly improved photocurrent originates from the red-shifted and broadened absorption of TC-FIC. The photon energy loss (Eloss) is defined by the equation Eloss = Eoptg − eVoc.71,72 The TC-FIC-based device exhibited a smaller Eloss of 0.56 than the NC-FIC-based device (0.63) because of a smaller HOMO energy level offset (ΔE) between the TC-FIC acceptor and PBDB-T polymer donor.73,74

Introducing PC71BM into a binary-blend system has been demonstrated to strengthen absorption in the short wavelengths and improve the morphology in the active layer.24,69,74–77 The ternary-blend devices PBDB-T:TC-FIC:PC71BM (1:1:1; 1:1:0.5 and 1:1:1.5 in wt%) incorporating different amounts of PC71BM exhibited significantly enhanced efficiencies and the average PCE of the ternary-blend is approximately 13.3%. It should be noted that the Voc of the ternary-blend devices remained unchanged, unlike the NC-FIC-based ternary devices which exhibited lower Voc as the ratio of PC71BM was increased.64 The PBDB-T:TC-FIC:PC71BM device with the optimized ratio (1:1:1 in wt%) achieved a highest PCE of 13.49% with an enhanced Jsc of 23.80 mA cm−2, a noticeably improved FF of 64.4%, and a Voc of 0.88 V. As shown in Fig. 4, all the ternary-blend devices exhibited improved EQE values in the entire spectrum from 300 to 850 nm compared to the binary-blend device. The dramatic enhancement in the short wavelengths (300–500 nm) mainly originated from the additional PC71BM component. Meanwhile, the FF of all the PC71BM-incorporated devices was also vastly enhanced as a result of the improved electron transport and optimized morphology. Furthermore, the efficient Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between three molecules might be another factor for the Jsc improvement.78,79
To further investigate the charge transport of the TC-FIC-based devices, the hole (μh) and electron mobility (μe) were measured by the space-charge limit current (SCLC) model. Electron-only and hole-only devices were fabricated using the configurations ITO/ZnO/active layer/Al and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au, respectively. The parameters and the J–V characteristic curves are shown in Table 2, Fig. S6 and S7.†μh and μe were estimated to be 1.83 × 10−5/7.00 × 10−7 for the PBDB-T:TC-FIC blend, which are higher than those of the NC-FIC-based binary device as shown in Table S1.† All the ternary-blend devices incorporating PC71BM exhibited not only improved μh and μe but also more balanced charge mobility. The optimized ternary-blend device of PBDB-T:TC-FIC:PC71BM (1:1:1 wt%) indeed possessed the most balanced μh/μe of 4.7 (μh = 1.54 × 10−4; μe = 3.31 × 10−5), which can explain the enhancement in FF and current density in the ternary-blend devices.
To study the molecular packing and orientation characteristics of the active layers, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was carried out. The two-dimensional (2-D) GIWAXS images of the binary and ternary blends with different ratios of PC71BM and their corresponding 1-D line-cuts are shown in Fig. 5. As shown in Fig. 5a, PBDB-T:TC-FIC-based blend film showed a strong (010) π–π stacking diffraction at 1.71 Å−1 in the out of plane direction (qz) corresponding to the π–π stacking d-spacing (dπ) of 3.67 Å, indicating a face-on orientation which can facilitate the vertical charge transport.

After incorporating PC71BM with different ratios, there is a clear trend of increasing intensity of the diffraction at 1.30 Å−1 which originated from the amorphous oriented PC71BM domain. Besides, all the ternary-blend films still maintained the obvious (010) π–π stacking diffraction with a similar dπ, suggesting that the incorporation of PC71BM as the third component does not affect the molecular packing between PBDB-T and TC-FIC. Compared with the NC-FIC-based ternary blend (Fig. 5e), the TC-FIC-based ternary blends exhibited a more dominant face-on orientation in any ratio of PC71BM, as attested by the sharper and stronger π–π stacking peak at qz = 1.71 Å−1, suggesting stronger intermolecular interactions among PBDB-T and TC-FIC.
Conclusions
Using 1-dimensional ladder-type donors in the A–D–A type small molecule acceptors has been proved to be essential to achieve high power conversion efficiency. Recent research on the donor development is mainly focused on extending the conjugation of a ladder-type donor in a linear dimension. However, extension of conjugation along the vertical direction to form a cross-shaped molecule remains challenging and has not been utilized for NFAs. In this work, we designed and synthesized a TTN-based TC, leading to a 2-dimensional TC-FIC acceptor. The TC with the vertically extended π-system strengthens the electron-donating ability, promotes π-electron delocalization and enhances intramolecular donor–acceptor and intermolecular π–π interactions. Consequently, TC-FIC possessed more red-shifted and widened absorption compared to the NC-FIC counterpart. The TC-FIC:PBDB-T device exhibited a higher efficiency of 11.6% which greatly outperformed the corresponding NC-FIC:PBDB-T device with only an efficiency of 7.52%. The dramatic 54% enhancement in efficiency is ascribed to the improved light-harvesting ability and enhanced charge mobilities which are benefited from the 2-dimensional TTN moiety. By incorporating PC71BM to improve shorter wavelength absorption and provide multiple electron transport channels, the ternary-blend PBDB-T:TC-FIC:PC71BM device (1:1:1 in wt%) achieved the highest PCE of 13.49% with an enhanced Jsc of 23.80 mA cm−2, an FF of 64.4%, and a Voc of 0.88 V. The average PCE is increased from 7.44% for NC-FIC to 11.04% for TC-FIC binary system. This work demonstrates that development of 2-dimensional cross-shaped ladder-type donors is promising for achieving high-performance A–D–A type n-type materials.
