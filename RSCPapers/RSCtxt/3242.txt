In comparison, the other highly defective SrNbO2N photoanodes demonstrated an unsatisfactory water oxidation performance, which demonstrates the necessity to reduce the destructive effect of defects in order to achieve a higher photocurrent density.
Introduction
Nowadays, photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting under solar irradiation has attracted a significant amount of attention owing to its low energy cost, recyclability, and environmental friendliness. Since Fujishima and Honda reported a water splitting system using TiO2 as a photoelectrode under ultraviolet irradiation,1 numerous studies focused on semiconductors such as metal oxides, sulfides, and (oxy) nitrides have been developed for solar energy conversion.2–4 It is worth mentioning that, for an efficient solar-to-hydrogen conversion, a photocatalyst with a narrower bandgap has more potential owing to the relatively higher proportion of visible light compared to UV irradiation in solar irradiation.5 Therefore, it is important to develop and study novel photocatalytic materials with a narrow band gap to extend their response to longer wavelengths so as to improve the utilization of sunlight.
To date, the majority of researchers have focused on metal (oxy) nitrides or (oxy) sulphides for photocatalytic and PEC water splitting under visible irradiation.6 The valence bands of these materials are more negative owing to the existence of N 2p or S 3p orbitals, which lead to a narrower bandgap with a wide spectral response range.5 Recently, perovskite-type oxynitrides containing Nb and Ta species have been regarded as potential materials, as they have absorption edges up to 500–700 nm for photocatalytic and PEC water oxidation under solar irradiation.7–9 Unfortunately, the PEC performance and solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of these particle-fabricated photoanodes are always limited by rapid recombination of the photogenerated holes and electrons, which mostly happens at the grain boundaries, surface defects and the solid–liquid interface. The defect engineering and surface control of various photoanodes have been deeply studied by researchers for the enhancement of PEC activities.8,10–12 For a practical PEC water system, a STH efficiency is expected to reach at least 10%, which is still a challenge owing to the inefficient light absorption, fast charge recombination and limited surface reaction kinetics.13,14 In addition to the limiting factors of the photocurrent mentioned above, photocorrosion of oxynitrides and sulphides occurs during the measurement operation, which results in the instability of photoanodes.
Perovskite-type oxynitrides containing Ti4+, Ta5+, and Nb5+ are considered to be a class of promising photocatalysts for water splitting, owing to their suitable band-edge position and narrow bandgap of 1.8–2.5 eV.15,16 There have been a lot of scientific reports published on Ta and Ti-based oxynitrides. Studies focusing on Nb-based perovskite-type oxynitrides rarely appear, compared with Ta-based oxynitrides owing to its multiple valence. However, the latter appeals to researchers owing to the narrower band gap and the longer absorption edge. In addition, Nb has greater reserves than Ta on earth and Nb is cheaper. As one of these materials, perovskite-type SrNbO2N is regarded as a potential visible-light-active photocatalyst with a band gap width of 1.8 eV.17 However, SrNbO2N particles synthesized via a thermal ammonolysis reaction from the oxide precursor inevitably contain amounts of crystal and interface defects.18,19 Furthermore, the Nb species is more easily reduced from Nb5+ to Nb4+ and Nb3+ during nitridation at high temperatures compared to the Ti and Ta species and furthermore, it forms surface anion defects in order to maintain the surface charge balance.20–22 There have already been some recent reports focusing on the effects of annealing BaNbO2N in inert Ar to enhance the PEC activities.20,21 The key point of this study is to minimize the formation of Nb4+ and Nb3+ as well as maintaining the high crystallinity and good surface condition of the perovskite-type SrNbO2N.
In this work, we have introduced a synthesizing route for SrNbO2N, including a flux-assisted nitridation and subsequent annealing process under an Ar atmosphere to suppress the formation of surface Nb4+ defects. Then, the SrNbO2N photoanodes were prepared through an electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method and modified with Co3O4 nanoparticles using a hydrothermal method.23–25 These treatments used in the procedure could promote the formation of highly crystalline SrNbO2N particles with minimum surface defects and a preferable interface condition, which lead to a high PEC water oxidation performance (photocurrent, 2.0 mA cm−2) under simulated sunlight.
Experimental
Synthesis of SrNbO2N
SrNbO2N particles were directly synthesized using a one-step nitridation method with chloride flux under an NH3 flow. SrCO3 (Aladdin, 99.95%) and Nb2O5 (Alfa Aesar, 99.9985%) were mixed in a molar ratio of Sr:Nb = 1:1. In this procedure, SrCl2 (Macklin, 99.5%) and KCl (Sinopharm chemical, 99.5%) were added as a chloride flux in different molar ratios (1:1, 2:1, 3:1). The total mass of the chloride flux was equal to the metallic oxide precursors. The mixtures were ground, transferred to a tube furnace and calcined for 10 h under flowing NH3 (300 ml min−1) at 800–900 °C. The synthesized SrNbO2N samples were then annealed under an Ar flow (200 ml min−1) at 600 °C for 1 h with a ramp rate of 10 °C min−1. Finally, after the samples were washed with deionized (DI) water to remove the remaining flux and dried, the brown-colored SrNbO2N powder was collected. The SrNbO2N particles prepared at different temperatures with chloride flux (SrCl2:KCl = 1:1) are denoted as SNON800, SNON850 and SNON900, respectively. The SrNbO2N particles synthesized with various composition of molten salt (SrCl2:KCl = 2:1 and 3:1) are represented as SNON850-2 and SNON850-3, respectively. SNON850-2 without the Ar annealing process is denoted as SNON850-2′. The detailed parameters are listed in Table S1.†
Fabrication of the SrNbO2N photoanode
The SrNbO2N photoanodes were fabricated via the EPD method, as mentioned in previous articles.23,24,26 SrNbO2N powders (20 mg) and iodine (5 mg) were dispersed in 25 ml acetone and sonicated for 2 h. Two parallel fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrodes were immersed in the suspension with a 1.5 cm distance between them. Then, a 10 V bias was applied between the two FTO electrodes for 2 min. The SrNbO2N-coated area was 1 × 1 cm−2. After the electrodes were washed using DI water and ethanol, the TiCl4 methanol solution (10 mM, 30 μl) was dropped onto the as-prepared electrodes and then annealed at 200 °C for 2 min under an ambient atmosphere. This dropping and annealing procedure was repeated several times. Then, the electrodes were calcined under an NH3 flow (200 ml min−1) at 440 °C for 30 min.
Deposition of cocatalysts onto SrNbO2N photoanodes
The deposition of Co3O4 nanoparticles onto SrNbO2N photoanodes was carried out using a facile hydrothermal method.25,27 In a typical procedure, 10 mg Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O was dissolved in 25 ml ethanol and sonicated for 10 min, 0.5 ml ammonium solution (NH3 H2O, 30 wt%) was added into the solution under stirring. Then, after stirring for a few minutes, the solution was transferred into a 50 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The as-fabricated electrodes were immersed in the solution. Then, the autoclave was tightly sealed and maintained at 393 K for 1 h. After natural cooling, the electrodes were washed with ethanol thoroughly and dried in air. Then, the Co3O4-modified photoanodes were annealed at 350 °C for 30 min under an Ar flow (200 ml min−1).
Material characterization
The crystallographic structure of the as-prepared photocatalysts was characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), which was carried out on a Bede D1 system operated at 20 kV and 30 mA with Cu Kα radiation. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM; S-4800, Hitachi) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, FEI F20) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were used to observe the morphology, elemental compositions and crystal structure. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were performed on a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer using a monochromatic Al Kα radiation source (1486.6 eV). The binding energies were corrected by reference to the adventitious carbon peak (284.8 eV) for the prepared samples. Diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectra (DRS) were measured using a Shimadzu UV3600 ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer.
PEC measurements
The PEC measurements for SrNbO2N were conducted using a conventional three-electrode cell system including a FTO glass as the working electrode, a platinum wire as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode. A 300 W Xe lamp with an AM 1.5G sunlight simulator (100 mW cm−2) was employed as the light source. All PEC measurements were carried out in 1 M aqueous NaOH electrolyte (pH = 13.6) with a computer-based electrochemical workstation (CHI760E). The measured potential versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) was calculated using the Nernst equation as:ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.0591 × pH + 0.197 V
The photocurrent was measured using linear sweep voltammetry with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was obtained under monochromatic light irradiation using a Xe lamp equipped with different monochromators. The IPCE was calculated according to the equation:  
In which λ represents the wavelength, Jlight and Jdark are the photocurrent densities under the irradiation of specific monochromatic light and in darkness, respectively, and Plight refers to the luminous power for each wavelength. The Mott–Schottky plots for the bare SrNbO2N photoanodes were carried out under dark conditions at frequencies of 500, 800, and 1000 Hz, respectively, with an AC amplitude of 10 mV. All of the measurements were made using 1 M NaOH as the electrolyte. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the SrNbO2N photoanodes were measured at a potential of 1.23 VRHE in a frequency range from 104 to 10−1 Hz with an AC amplitude of 10 mV.
Results and discussion
Characterization
The X-ray patterns of all of the SrNbO2N powders synthesized using the one-step method with chloride flux could be perfectly ascribed to the pure SrNbO2N phase (PDF#39-0675), as shown in Fig. 1. The XRD patterns of SrNbO2N obtained using different experimental parameters are similar and exhibit sharp diffraction peaks, indicating that all of these flux-assisted nitridation processes can obtain pure and highly crystalline SrNbO2N.
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns for the SrNbO2N powders synthesized using the one-step method. 
Scanning electron microscopy was used to investigate the morphological features of the SrNbO2N photoanodes and HR-TEM was used to identify the crystal structure and interface state, as shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2a and S1† show that all of the SrNbO2N powders synthesized using different experimental parameters have a similar particle size and smooth surface. However, the SrNbO2N particles with more SrCl2 added as flux during the nitridation (SNON850-2, SNON850-3) have more exposed facets and a well defined particle morphology, whereas the SNON800, SNON850, SNON900 samples exhibit a rod-like morphology. The photoanodes prepared using EPD have particle-assembled films with an average thickness of about 2.5–3 μm (Fig. 2b and S1†). The particles of the photoanodes display a clear lattice spacing of 0.296 nm (Fig. 2c and d), identified as the (110) plane of SrNbO2N, which confirms that these photoanodes are formed by well-crystallized SrNbO2N particles. In addition, the Co3O4 nanoparticles were found to be discretely distributed on the surface of the SrNbO2N particles, with a diameter of ∼10 nm (Fig. 2d). Apparently, the lattice spacing of 0.242 nm can be identified as the (311) planes of Co3O4 in the HR-TEM image (Fig. 2d). Furthermore, the HR-TEM image (Fig. 2d) shows that the samples exhibit good interface bonding between the two phases, which benefits the motion of the photo-generated holes and electrons, resulting in a higher PEC activity. In addition, the HR-TEM images and corresponding EDX elemental mapping images of N, O, Co, Sr and Nb for the SrNbO2N particles are shown in Fig. S2.† The agglomerated Co3O4 particles can be clearly identified by the different distribution patterns of the Co and Sr (or Nb) elements.

Band structure of SrNbO2N
In our work, a Tauc-plot, Mott–Schottky plots and the valence band maximum (VBM) were applied to determine the band position of SrNbO2N. As shown in Fig. 3a, the UV-vis spectra of SNON800, SNON850, and SNON900 have an obvious absorption tail above 650 nm, which can be ascribed to the absorption of the Nb4+ species.17,19,28,29 The absorption tails for SNON850-2 and SNON850-3, are depressed, indicating the decreased defect density of the samples. The Tauc-plot derived (Fig. 3b) from the UV-vis spectra (Fig. 3a) indicated that the band gap of the obtained SrNbO2N was 1.88 eV. To obtain the position of the valence band, the VBM for SrNbO2N was measured using an XPS valence band (VB) spectrum, as shown in Fig. 3c. The photoelectrons were detected from 1.76 eV, which indicated that the VBM potential for SrNbO2N is 1.76 eV below the flat band potential (Efb).

The Mott–Schottky plots performed at 500, 800 and 1000 Hz are shown in Fig. 3d, respectively. The Efb was determined at −0.19 VNHE using the intercept method. Therefore, the position of both the conduction band minimum (CBM) and the valence band maximum (VBM) can be approximately determined at −0.31 VNHE and +1.57 VNHE, respectively, which straddle the reduction (+0 VNHE) and oxidation (+1.23 VNHE) potentials of water.
According to all of these experiments and measurements, the band structure diagram of SrNbO2N is depicted in Fig. 4. The band structure of SrNbO2N indicates a great potential for water splitting in theory, owing to the proper band position (CBM and VBM) and relatively narrow bandgap.

Photocatalytic performance
The SrNbO2N photoanodes were prepared using the EPD method. Then, the post-necking treatment was carried out to connect the particles together and promote transport of the photo-generated carriers.30 The current–potential curves for the SrNbO2N photoanodes under simulated sunlight are shown in Fig. 5. Specifically, the photocurrent density at 1.23 VRHE can reach up to 1.28 mA cm−2 for the SNON850/Co3O4 photoanode, almost 1.5 times and 4 times that of the SNON800/Co3O4 (0.85 mA cm−2) and SNON900/Co3O4 (0.33 mA cm−2) photoanodes, respectively. These experiments confirm the optimum nitridation temperature to be 850 °C, which can help simultaneously maintain the high crystallinity and low defect density. The lower temperature affects the crystallinity of the samples. Nevertheless, ammonia at a high temperature possesses a stronger reduction ability owing to the decomposition reaction, leading to a lower crystal integrity and increasing recombination centers.19,31

Moreover, the effect of flux on the PEC activities was investigated by adjusting the composition of the melt salt. Researchers have used strontium chloride as flux to assist the formation process of SrNbO2N and SrTaO2N.13,32,33 However, the melting point of SrCl2 (876 °C)34 is higher than the calcination temperature in our synthesis procedure.31 Pure SrCl2 cannot melt completely at 800 °C and 850 °C, playing an effective role as flux. Therefore, the mixture SrCl2–KCl with different molar ratios of 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1 (denoted as SNON850, SNON850-2, SNON850-3, respectively) were used as the flux to prepare the SrNbO2N powders. The photocurrent density of SNON850-2/Co3O4 at 1.23 VRHE was 2.0 mA cm−2, about 1.56 times higher than SNON850/Co3O4. Unfortunately, as the molar ratio of SrCl2 rises, the SNON850-3/Co3O4 photoanodes exhibited an unsatisfactory performance, with a photocurrent density of 0.96 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE. Furthermore, the photocurrent density of the photoanode prepared using SNON850-2 without Ar annealing was about 1.08 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE (Fig. S3†). The significant performance enhancement of the SNON850-2 photoanode may be ascribed to the preferable surface conditions after annealing in the Ar atmosphere.
In addition, the EIS results for the SrNbO2N series (Fig. S4†) show that SNON850-2 has a smaller arc radius than that of the other photoanodes, indicating a lower resistance between the photoanode and the electrolyte. The SNON850-2 photoanode has the fastest charge transfer process in the photoanode system, which supports the higher PEC activities of the SNON850-2 photoanode.
The SNON850-2 photoanode modified with Co3O4 nanoparticles exhibited a preferable PEC performance compared to the other as-prepared photoanodes. The plot of the IPCE of the Co3O4-modified SNON850-2 photoanode is shown in Fig. 6. At an applied potential of 1.23 VRHE, the IPCE reaches 12% under 420 and 450 nm irradiation for the as-prepared photoanode. As the wavelength of irradiation increases to over 500 nm, the IPCE decreases visibly, corresponding to the absorbance curve of the SNON850-2 particles. The IPCE falls to 2.8% at 650 nm, but there is still an obvious photocurrent under the irradiation of 650 nm monochromatic light. Undoubtedly, the water oxidation performance of the SrNbO2N photoanodes was obviously improved after a series of synthesis and treatment processes. In addition, the integrated photocurrent was obtained by integrating the IPCE data between 380 and 650 nm with the standard solar spectrum.35–37 The calculated photocurrent of 1.55 mA cm−2 was slightly lower than the measured photocurrent of 2.0 mA cm−2 owing to the narrower integrated range than actual spectral response range. The current–time curve for SNON850-2/Co3O4 photoanode was also performed at a 1.23 VRHE bias voltage, as shown in Fig. S5.† Regrettably, the photocurrent density falls to half its initial amount after a few minutes owing to the photo-oxidative self-corrosion. The XPS spectra of the SNON850-2/Co3O4 photoanode before and after the stability testing was carried out and is shown in Fig. S6.† Research on preventing photocorrosion mainly focuses on the passivation layers and hole-storage layer for the (oxy) nitrides, including Ni(OH)x, MoO3,38 ferrihydrite,27,39 and the amorphous TiOXH layer.40 These films can be obtained by impregnation, electrochemical deposition, photo-deposition, sputtering, and atomic layer deposition (ALD) and other physical or chemical methods. Deeper research and exploration on the stability of the SrNbO2N photoanode will be the focus of our next study.

Analysis of the surface Nb species
The chemical elements and states were explored by analysis of the XPS spectra of the SrNbO2N photoanodes synthesized using different experimental procedures, as shown in Fig. 7 and S6.† The narrow-scan Nb 3d spectra were applied to define the chemical state of the surface Nb species. The raw narrow-scan Nb 3d spectra involves two overlapping peaks, which can be assigned to two different Nb 3d5/2−3/2 doublets, Nb5+ (206.8 and 209.6 eV) and Nb4+ (205.7 and 208.5 eV), respectively. The 3d5/2 binding energies for Nb5+ and Nb4+ were referenced to those for SrNbO2N and NbO2.33,41 As previous literature has mentioned, low valent Nb species (Nb3+ and Nb4+) derive from nitridation owing to the reducing atmosphere under a NH3 flow. In the present work, all of the narrow-scan Nb 3d spectra indicate that the Nb3+ species were not formed during the process as there was no tailing of peaks at lower binding energies.19–21 Then, the fractions of the surface Nb species were estimated using the area ratio of the specific Nb species (Nb5+, Nb4+) and the total Nb species, as shown in Table 1.

As Fig. 7 and Table 1 show, the Nb 3d spectrum of the sample nitrided at 850 °C displays a higher content of Nb5+ than the samples nitrided at 800 °C and 900 °C. In theory, ammonia at a higher temperature exhibits a higher ability for reduction, leading to reduction from Nb5+ to Nb4+. However, the milder condition (SNON800) probably reduces the content of N species and the N/O ratio based on the relevant literature on N-doped Sr2Nb2O7, further promoting the formation of surface Nb4+ defects and other ionic defects in order to balance the surface charge.4 In addition, the milder nitridation condition led to the lower crystallinity of the samples, which introduces more recombination centers in the charge carrier. Therefore, there is an optimum temperature (850 °C) for inhibition of the reduction of the Nb species and the formation of ionic defects, as well as maintaining a relatively high crystallinity, to obtain a maximum photocurrent density.
 Fig. 7  Narrow-scan Nb 3d XPS spectra for the SrNbO2N photoanodes fabricated using different experimental parameters. 
In addition, the effects of the flux on the fabrication of the SrNbO2N photoanodes were investigated. The XPS spectra of the SrNbO2N photoanodes prepared using different flux contents are shown in Fig. 7. According to Table 1, the spectrum of SNON850-2 shows the least content of Nb4+, which is considered to be the main cause of the surface ionic defects and the increasing recombination centers. Previous literature has reported that a high Sr/Nb ratio in the precursors can supposedly suppress the reduction of Nb5+ and decrease surface defects, but the reason for this has not yet been proposed clearly.22,42,43 Based on the literature and the XPS spectra performed in our research, we can assume that a slightly higher Sr ratio in flux also affects the fabrication of the SrNbO2N particles and suppresses the formation of Nb4+. However, considering the higher ratio of SrCl2 (melting point 876 °C), the melting point of the molten salt mixture increases accordingly. The mixture with a higher melting point may not act as an effective flux as the mixture with a lower melting point owing to the differences in the viscosity and flowability at the same nitridation temperature (850 °C).
Moreover, the narrow-scan Nb 3d spectrum of SNON850-2 without Ar annealing was also analyzed as a comparison, which emphasizes the importance of the annealing process in surface management. The analysis of the XPS spectra reveals that all of these, including the nitridation temperature, the composition of the molten salt and the subsequent annealing process under an Ar flow, affect the surface Nb species and ionic defects of the SrNbO2N photoanodes, which have an impact on the PEC activities.
Conclusions
In summary, particle-assembled SrNbO2N photoanodes were obtained using a flux-assisted nitridation reaction. The optimal experimental parameters, including the nitridation temperature, molar ratio of flux (SrCl2:KCl) and subsequent annealing process were studied for the fabrication of photoanodes. Then, discrete Co3O4 nanoparticles are first loaded onto the SrNbO2N photoanodes as cocatalysts to facilitate the charge separation, as well as providing more reactive sites. An optimum photocurrent density of 2.0 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE was achieved on the Co3O4 modified SNON850-2 photoanode under simulated sunlight, which is a relatively high photocurrent that is comparable to those reported for other SrNbO2N photoanodes. In this study, the optimal nitridation temperature and flux composition were investigated to control the bulk defects and ensure a high crystallinity, while annealing in Ar atmosphere further suppressed the formation of surface Nb4+ defects. The enhanced photocurrent density of the SrNbO2N photoanodes is mainly due to low density of the Nb4+ defects, as well as the high crystallinity, which is critical to the PEC activities. This work potentially provides a reference to fabricate Nb-based perovskite-type oxynitrides as photoanodes for more efficient PEC water splitting.
